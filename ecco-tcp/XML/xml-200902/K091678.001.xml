<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Work was begun a great number of years past, when the empire of <HI>Great Britain</HI> was entire, and pos∣sessed the northern part of the New World with envied splen∣dor. At that period I formed a design of collecting materials for a partial History of its Animals; and with true pains, by various correspondencies, made far greater progress in my plan than my most sanguine expectations had framed. Above a century ago, an illustrious predecessor in the line of Natural History, who as greatly exceeded me in abilities as he did in zeal, meditated a voyage to the New World, in pursuance of a similar design. The gentleman alluded to was FRANCIS WILLUGHBY, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> who died in 1672, on the point of put∣ting his design in execution. Emulous of so illustrious an example, I took up the object of his pursuit; but my many relative duties forbade me from carrying it to the length con∣ceived by that great and good man. What he would have per∣formed, from an actual inspection in the native country of the several subjects under consideration, I must content myself to do, in a less perfect manner, from preserved specimens transmit∣ted to me; and offer to the world their Natural History, taken from gentlemen or writers who have paid no small attention to their manners.</P>
<P>Let me repeat, that this Work was designed as a sketch of the Zoology of <HI>North America.</HI> I thought I had a right to
<PB REF="4"/>
the attempt, at a time I had the honor of calling myself a fel∣low-subject with that respectable part of our former great em∣pire; but when the fatal and humiliating hour arrived, which deprived <HI>Britain</HI> of power, strength, and glory, I felt the morti∣fication which must strike every feeling individual at losing his little share in the boast of ruling over half of the New World. I could no longer support my clame of entitling myself its humble Zoologist: yet, unwilling to fling away all my labors, do now deliver them to the Public under the title of the ARCTIC ZOOLOGY. I added to them a description of the Quadrupeds and Birds of the north of <HI>Europe</HI> and of <HI>Asia,</HI> from latitude 60 to the farthest known parts of the <HI>Arctic</HI> World, together with those of <HI>Kamtschatka,</HI> and the parts of <HI>America</HI> visited in the last voyage of the illustrious COOK. These additional parts I have flung into the form of an Appendix to each ge∣nus, and distinguished by a <HI>fleur de lis;</HI> and the species by literal instead of numeral marks, which distinguish those of <HI>North America.</HI> These will, in a great measure, shew the dilatation of Quadrupeds and Birds, and the migrations of the feathered tribe, within part of the northern hemisphere.</P>
<P>I have, whenever I could get information, given their respec∣tive residences, as well as migrations to far more northern parts, to shew to what very remote places the Author of Na∣ture hath impelled them to retire, to breed in security. This wise provision preserves the species entire, and enables them to return by myriads, to contribute to the food or luxuries of southern climates. Whatever is wanting in the <HI>American</HI> part, I may foresee, will in time be amply supplied. The powers of literature will soon arise, with the other strengths of the new empire, and some native Naturalist give perfection to that
<PB REF="5"/>
part of the undertaking, by observations formed on the spot, in the uses, manners, and migrations. Should, at present, no one be inclined to take the pen out of my hand, remarks from the other side of the <HI>Atlantic,</HI> from any gentlemen of conge∣nial studies, will add peculiar pleasure to a favorite pursuit, and be gratefully received.</P>
<P>I must reckon among my most valued correspondents on the New Continent, Doctor ALEXANDER GARDEN<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Now resident in <HI>London.</HI></NOTE>, who, by his long residence in <HI>South Carolina,</HI> was enabled to commu∣nicate to me variety of curious remarks and subjects, as will appear in the following pages.</P>
<P>To the rich museum of <HI>American</HI> Birds, preserved by Mrs. ANNA BLACKBURN, of <HI>Orford,</HI> near <HI>Warrington,</HI> I am indebted for the opportunity of describing almost every one known in the provinces of <HI>Jersey, New York,</HI> and <HI>Connecticut.</HI> They were sent over to that Lady by her brother, the late Mr. <HI>Ashton Blackburn;</HI> who added to the skill and zeal of a sports∣man, the most pertinent remarks on the specimens he col∣lected for his worthy and philosophical sister.</P>
<P>In the foremost rank of the philosophers of the Old Conti∣nent, from whose correspondence I have benefited, I must place Doctor PETER SIM. PALLAS, at present Professor of Natural History in the service of the illustrious EMPRESS of <HI>Russia:</HI> he not only favored me with the fullest remarks on the Zoological part of that vast empire, most of which he formed from actual travel and observation, but collected for my use various other remarks from the manuscripts of his predecessors; especially what related to <HI>Kamtschatka</HI> from those
<PB REF="6"/>
of STELLER; which have assisted me in the history of parts hitherto but very slightly understood.</P>
<P>From the correspondency and labors of Mr. EBERH. AUG. WILLIAM ZIMMERMAN, Professor of Mathematics at <HI>Bruns∣wic,</HI> I have collected most uncommon instruction. His <HI>Specimen Zoologiae Geographicae Quadrupedum</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A quarto in <HI>Latin,</HI> containing 685 pages, printed at <HI>Leyden,</HI> 1777; sold in <HI>London</HI> by Mr. <HI>Faden,</HI> Geographer, <HI>St. Martin's Lane.</HI></NOTE> is a work which gives a full view of the class of Quadrupeds, and the progress they have made in spreading over the face of the earth, according to cli∣mates and latitudes. Their limits are described, in general, with uncommon accuracy. Much is said of the climates themselves; of the varieties of mankind; of the effects of heat and cold on them and other animals. A most curious map is joined to the work, in which is given the name of every animal in its proper cli∣mate; so that a view of the whole Quadruped creation is placed before one's eyes, in a manner perfectly new and instructive<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">A new edition of the map has been lately published by the learned Author; the geographical part is corrected according to the late voyages of Captain COOK, and great additions made to the zoological part. An explanation is given, in the third volume of the <HI>Zoologia Geographica,</HI> lately published in <HI>German</HI> by the Author.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>To the following foreigners, distinguished for their literary knowlege, I must pay my best acknowlegement for variety of most useful communications: Doctor ANDERS SPARMAN, of <HI>Stockholm;</HI> Doctor CHARLES P. THUNBERG, of <HI>Upsal;</HI> Mr. AND. J. RETZIUS, Professor of Natural History at <HI>Lund;</HI> Mr. MARTIN THRANE BRUNNICH, Professor of Natural History, and Mr. OTHO MULLER, Author of the <HI>Zoologia Danica,</HI> both of <HI>Copenhagen:</HI> and let me add my great obligations to the la∣bors of the Reverend Mr. OTTO FABRICIUS, for his most finished <HI>Fauna</HI> of <HI>Greenland.</HI></P>
<P><PB REF="7"/>To many of my countrymen my best thanks are due for literary assistances. Sir JOSEPH BANKS, Baronet, will, I hope, accept my thanks for the free admittance to those parts of his cabinet which more immediately related to the subject of the following sheets.</P>
<P>To Sir ASHTON LEVER, Knight, I am highly indebted, for the more intimate and closer examination of his treasures than was allowed to the common visitors of his most magnificent museum.</P>
<P>To Mr. SAMUEL HEARN, the great explorer by land of the <HI>Icy Sea,</HI> I cannot but send my most particular thanks, for his liberal communication of many zoological remarks, made by him on the bold and fatiguing adventure he undertook from <HI>Hudson's Bay</HI> to the <HI>ne plus ultra</HI> of the north on that side.</P>
<P>Mr. ANDREW GRAHAM, long a resident in <HI>Hudson's Bay,</HI> obliged me with numbers of observations on the country, and the use of multitudes of specimens of animals transmitted by him to the late museum of the Royal Society, at the instance of that liberal patron of science, my respected friend the Ho∣norable DAINES BARRINGTON.</P>
<P>Let me close the list with acknowleging the great assistance I have found in the Synopsis of Birds by Mr. JOHN LATHAM; a work now brought almost to a conclusion, and which contains a far greater number of descriptions than any which has gone before. This is owing not only to the assiduity of the Au∣thor, but also to the peculiar spirit of the <HI>English</HI> nation, which has, in its voyages to the most remote and most opposite parts of the globe, payed attention to every branch of science. The advantages are pointed out by the able pen of the Reverend Doctor DOUGLAS, in his Introduction to the last Voyage of
<PB REF="8"/>
our great navigator, published (under the auspices of the Lords of the Admiralty) in a manner which reflects honor on our country in general, and will prove a most lasting monument to the memory of the great Officer who so unfortunately pe∣rished by savage hands, and his two able consorts, who at length sunk beneath the pressure of fatigue, in carrying the glory of discovery far beyond the attempts of every preceding adventurer.</P>

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION. OF THE ARCTIC WORLD.</HEAD>
<P>AKNOWLEGE of the geography, climate, and soil, and a general view of the productions of the countries, whose Zoologic History is to be treated of, are points so necessary, that no apology need be made for introducing them into a prefatory discourse.</P>
<P>It is worthy human curiosity to trace the gradual increase of the animal world, from the scanty pittance given to the rocks of <HI>Spitzbergen,</HI> to the swarms of beings which enliven the vegetating plains of <HI>Senegal:</HI> to point out the causes of the local niggardness of certain places, and the prodigious plenty in others. The Botanist should attend the fancied voyage I am about to take, to explain the scanty herbage of the <HI>Arctic</HI> regions; or, should I at any time hereafter descend into the lower latitudes, to investigate the luxuriancy of plants in the warmer climates.</P>
<P>The Fossilist should join company, and point the variations of primaeval crea∣tion, from the solid rock of <HI>Spitzbergen</HI> through all the degrees of terrestrial matter: the steps it makes to perfection, from the vilest earth to the precious diamond of <HI>Golconda.</HI> The changes in the face of the globe should be attended to; the de∣structions by vulcanoes; the ravages of the sea on some coasts, and the recom∣pence it may have made to others, by the retreat of its waters.</P>
<P>The pursuit of these enquiries will also have a farther and more important object. History should be called in, and a brief account given of the population of the more remote countries—the motives which induced mankind to seek re∣treats in climates seemingly destitute of incitements to migration. Particular attention should be paid to the means of peopling the new world, and of stocking it with animals, to contribute to the support of mankind, after the first coloniza∣tion—the increase of those animals, and their cessation, and giving place in a certain latitude to genera entirely different.</P>
<P><PB N="II" REF="12"/>Here the fine study of Geography should step in to our assistance. The outline of the terrestrial globe should be traced; the several approximations between part and part should be attended to; the nature of the oceans observed; the various islands pointed out, as the steps, the baiting-places where mankind might have rested in its passage from an overcharged continent.</P>
<P>The manners of the people ought not less to be attended to; and their changes, both mental and corporeal, by comparison of the present state of remote people with nations with whom they had common ancestors, and who may have been discovered still to retain their primaeval seats. Some leading customs may still have been pre∣served in both; or some monuments of antiquity, proofs of congenial habitudes, possibly no longer extant in the savage than in the cultivated branches of the common stock.</P>
<P>Let me take my departure northward, from the narrow streights of <HI>Dover,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">STREIGHTS OF DOVES.</NOTE> the site of the isthmus of the once peninsulated <HI>Britain.</HI> No certain cause can be given for the mighty convulsion which tore us from the continent: whether it was rent by an earthquake, or whether it was worn through by the continual dashing of the waters, no <HI>Pythagoras</HI> is left to solve the <HI>Fortuna locorum:</HI>
<Q><L>Vidi ego, quod suerat quondam solidissima tellus</L>
<L>Esse fretum</L></Q>
But it is most probable, that the great philosopher alluded to the partial destruction of the <HI>Atlantica insula,</HI> mentioned by <HI>Plato</HI> as a distant tradition in his days<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Plato</HI> died about the year 347 before CHRIST, aged 81. <HI>Pythagoras,</HI> about 497, aged 90.</NOTE>. It was effected by an earthquake and a deluge, which might have rent asunder the narrow isthmus in question, and left <HI>Britain,</HI> large as it seems at present, the mere wreck of its original size<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See this opinion farther discussed by Mr. <HI>Somner, Ph. Trans. Abridg.</HI> iv. 230.</NOTE>. The <HI>Scilly</HI> isles, the <HI>Hebrides, Orknies, Schet∣lands,</HI> and perhaps the <HI>Feroe</HI> islands, may possibly be no more than fragments of the once far-extended region. I have no quarrel about the word <HI>island.</HI> The little isthmus, compared to the whole, might have been a junction never attend∣ed to in the limited navigations of very early times. The peninsula had never been wholly explored, and it passed with the antients for a genuine island. The correspondency of strata on part of the opposite shores of <HI>Britain</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> leaves no room to doubt but that they were once united.<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHALKY STRATA.</NOTE> The chalky cliffs of <HI>Blanc-nez,</HI> between <HI>Calais</HI> and <HI>Bologne,</HI> and those to the westward of <HI>Dover,</HI> ex∣actly tally: the last are vast and continued; the former short, and the termina∣tion of the immense bed. Between <HI>Bologne</HI> and <HI>Folkstone</HI> (about six miles from
<PB N="III" REF="13"/>
the latter) is another memorial of the junction of the two countries; a narrow submarine hill, called the <HI>Rip-raps,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">RIP-RAPS.</NOTE> about a quarter of a mile broad, and ten miles long, extending eastwards towards the <HI>Goodwin</HI> Sands. Its materials are boulder-stones, adventitious to many strata. The depth of water on it, in very low spring-tides, is only fourteen feet. The fishermen from <HI>Folkstone</HI> have often touched it with a fifteen feet oar; so that it is justly the dread of navigators. Many a tall ship has perished on it, and sunk instantly into twenty-one fathoms water. In <HI>July</HI> 1782, the <HI>Belleisle</HI> of sixty-four guns struck, and lay on it during three hours; but, by starting her beer and water, got clear off.</P>
<P>These celebrated streights are only twenty-one miles wide in the narrowest part.<NOTE PLACE="marg">WIDTH OF THE STREIGHTS.</NOTE> From the pier at <HI>Dover</HI> to that at <HI>Calais</HI> is twenty-four. It is conjectured, that their breadth lessens, and that they are two miles narrower than they were in antient times. An accurate observer of fifty years, remarks to me, that the encreased height of water, from a decrease of breadth, has been apparent even in that space. The depth of the channel, at a medium, in highest spring-tides, is about twenty-five fathoms. The bottom, either coarse sand or rugged scars, which have for ages unknown resisted the attrition of the currents.<NOTE PLACE="marg">DEPTH.</NOTE> From the streights, both eastward and westward, is a gradual increase of depth thorough the channel to a hundred fathoms, till soundings are totally lost or unattend∣ed to.</P>
<P>The spring-tides in the streights rise, on an average, twenty-four feet; the neap-tides fifteen. The tide flows from the <HI>German</HI> sea, passes the streights, and meets, with a great rippling, the western tide from the ocean, between <HI>Fairleigh,</HI> near <HI>Hastings,</HI> and <HI>Bologne</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">All the intelligence respecting the tides, &amp;c. in these parts, I received from Mr. <HI>James Hammond</HI> of the custom-house, <HI>Dover,</HI> and Mr. <HI>William Cowly,</HI> a veteran pilot of the same place.</NOTE>; a proof, that if the separation of the land was ef∣fected by the seas, it must have been by the overpowering weight of those of the north.</P>
<P>It is most certain, that <HI>Britain</HI> was peopled from <HI>Gaul.</HI> Similar customs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BRITAIN, WHENCE PEOPLED.</NOTE> as far as can be collected, evince this fact. The period is beyond the reach of history.

If, after the event by which our island was torn from the continent, the migra∣tion over so narrow a streight might, in the earlier ages, have been very readily effected in the <HI>vitilia navigia</HI> or coracles, or the <HI>monoxyla</HI> or canoes in use in the remote periods; but the numerous species of Quadrupeds never could have swam into our island, even over such a contracted water, which at all times must have been possessed by tides so rapid, as to baffle their utmost efforts: their passage, therefore, must have been over the antient isthmus; for it is contrary to common sense to suppose, that our ancestors would have been at the trouble of transporting such guests as wolves and bears, and the numerous train of lesser rapacious ani∣mals, even had it been practicable for them to have introduced the domestic and useful species.

Boars were common in the neighborhood of <HI>London</HI> in the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> II. and continued in our kingdom, in a wild state, till 1577: they were then only to be found in the woods of Lord <HI>Latimer,</HI> who, we are informed by Doctor <HI>Mou∣fet,</HI> took great delight in their chace<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Health's Emprovement.</NOTE>.

<P>Birds,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BIRDS.</NOTE> which have the ready means of wafting themselves from place to place, have notwithstanding, in numbers of instances, their limits. Climate confines some within certain bounds, and particular sorts of food induce others to remain within countries not very remote from us; yet, by wonderful instinct, birds will follow cultivation, and make themselves denizens of new regions. The CROSS∣BILL has followed the apple into <HI>England. Glenco,</HI> in the <HI>Highlands</HI> of <HI>Scotland,</HI> never knew the Partridge, till its farmers of late years introduced corn into their lands: nor did Sparrows ever appear in <HI>Sibiria,</HI> till after the <HI>Russians</HI> had made arable the vast wastes of those parts of their dominions. Finally, the Rice Bunt∣ings, p. 360, natives of <HI>Cuba,</HI> after the planting of rice in the <HI>Carolinas,</HI> annually quit the island in myriads, and fly over sea and land, to partake of a harvest intro∣duced there from the distant <HI>India.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="VI" REF="16"/>FRANCE, as it exceeds in variation of climate, so it exceeds us in the number of species of birds. We can boast of only one hundred and thirty-one kinds of land-birds, and one hundred and twenty-one of water-fowl. <HI>France,</HI> on the contrary, has one hundred and fifty-six of the first, and one hundred and thirteen of the last. This computation may not be quite accurate; for no one has as yet attempted its <HI>Fauna,</HI> which must be very numerous, in a kingdom which extends from <HI>Calais,</HI> in about lat. 51, to <HI>Collioure</HI> in the south of <HI>Roussillon,</HI> on the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> sea, in about lat. 42.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">COASTS OF BRI∣TAIN.</NOTE>Stupendous and precipitous ranges of chalky cliffs attend the coast, from <HI>Dover</HI> eastward, and, from their color, gave the name of <HI>Albion</HI> to our island. Beneath one of them anchored <HI>Cesar,</HI> fifty-five years before CHRIST, and so near as to be capable of being annoyed by the darts of the <HI>Britons.</HI> After weighing anchor, he sailed up a bay, now occupied by meadows, and landed at <HI>Rutupium, Richborough,</HI> opposite to the present <HI>Sandwich.</HI> The walls of the former still evince its antient strength; and the vestiges of a quay, now bounded by a ditch, points out the anchorage of the <HI>Roman</HI> commerce. The adjacent <HI>Thanet,</HI> the <HI>Thanatos</HI> of the antients, at pre∣sent indistinguishable from the main land, was in old times an island, separated by a deep channel, from a mile and a half to four miles in width, the site of <HI>Roman</HI> settlements; and, in 449, celebrated for having been the first landing-place of the invading <HI>Saxons;</HI> to whom it was assigned as a place of security by the imprudent <HI>Vortigern.</HI> But such a change has time effected, that <HI>Thanet</HI> no more exists as an island; and the <HI>Britanniarum Portus,</HI> in which rode the <HI>Roman</HI> navies, is now filled with marshy meads.</P>
<P>After passing the lofty chalky promontory, the <HI>North Foreland,</HI> opens the estuary of the <HI>Thames,</HI> bounded on each side by low shores, and its channels divided by numerous sand-banks; securely passed, by reason of the perfection of navigation, by thousands of ships frequenting annually <HI>London,</HI> our emporium, envied nearly to impending decline.</P>
<P>On the projecting coasts of <HI>Suffolk</HI> and <HI>Norfolk,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">SUFFOLK AND NORFOLK.</NOTE> arise, in certain intervals, emi∣nences of different matter. <HI>Loamy</HI> cliffs appear about <HI>Leostoffe, Dunwich,</HI> &amp;c. The <HI>Crag-pits</HI> about <HI>Woodbridge,</HI> are prodigious pits of sea-shells, many of them perfect and quite solid; an inexhaustible fund of manure for arable lands. About <HI>Yarmouth,</HI> and from thence beyond <HI>Wintertoness,</HI> the coast is low, flat, and com∣posed of shingle, backed by sand. From <HI>Hapsburgh</HI> to <HI>Cromer</HI> are a range of lofty clayey precipices, rising from the height of forty to a hundred feet perpendicular; a prey to the ocean, which has effected great changes in these parts. About <HI>Sherringham</HI> and <HI>Cley,</HI> it rises into pretty and gentle hills, sloping down into a
<PB N="VII" REF="17"/>
rough shore, of little rocks and stones. At <HI>Holkham, Wells,</HI> and <HI>Wareham,</HI> the sandy shores terminate in little hillocks of sand, kept together by the <HI>Arundo Are∣naria,</HI> or <HI>Bent,</HI> the great preservative against the inundations of sand, which would otherwise destroy whole tracts of country, and in particular soon render useless the range of salt-marshes which these are backed with. <HI>Hunstanton</HI> cliff rises a distin∣guished feature in this flat tract. The surface is the usual vegetable mould, about a foot deep; beneath that are two feet of small broken pieces of chalk: the solid stratum of the same, after having been lost for numbers of miles, here again makes its appearance, and forms a solid bed thirty feet in thickness, resting on a hard red stone four feet deep, which is often ground and made into a red paint. Seven feet of loose friable dirty yellow stone succeeds, placed on a base of iron-colored plumb-pudding-stone, projecting into the sea, with vast fragments scattered over the beach. This cliff is about eighty feet high, lies on the entrance of the washes, the <HI>Metaris Estuarium</HI> of <HI>Ptolemy.</HI> From hence, all the coast by <HI>Snettisham</HI> to <HI>Lynn</HI> is low, flat, and shingly.</P>
<P>From <HI>Holm,</HI> the northern promontory of <HI>Norfolk,</HI> the sea advances deeply west∣ward, and forms the great bay called the <HI>Washes,</HI> filled with vast sand-banks, the summits of which are dry at low water; but the intervening channels are the means of prodigious commerce to <HI>Lynn</HI> in <HI>Norfolk,</HI> seated on the <HI>Ouze,</HI> which is circulated into the very inland parts of our island, through the various rivers which fall into its long course. <HI>Lynn</HI> is mentioned in the <HI>Doomsday Book;</HI> but became considerable for its commerce with <HI>Norway</HI> as early as the year 1284.</P>
<P>The opposite shore is that of <HI>Lincolnshire.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">LINCOLNSHIRE.</NOTE> Its great commercial town, <HI>Boston,</HI> stands on the <HI>Witham,</HI> a few miles from the head of the bay. Spring-tides rise at the quay fourteen feet, and convey there vessels of above a hundred tons; but greater ships lie at the <HI>Scap,</HI> the opening of the estuary. Such is the case at <HI>Lynn;</HI> for the sluggish rivers of these tame tracts want force to form a depth of water.</P>
<P><HI>Lincolnshire,</HI> and part of six other counties, are the <HI>Pais-bas,</HI> the <HI>Low Countries</HI> of <HI>Britain;</HI> the former bounded on the western part by a range of elevated land, which, in this humble county, overlooks, as <HI>Alps</HI> would the ocean, the remaining part. This very extensive tract, from the <HI>Scap</HI> to the northern headland opposite to <HI>Hull,</HI> presents to the sea a bow-like and almost unindented front; and so low as to be visible from sea only at a small distance; and churches, instead of hills, are the only landmarks to seamen. The whole coast is fronted with salt-marshes or sand-hills, and secured by artificial banks against the fury of the sea. Old <HI>Holins∣head</HI> gives a long list of ports on this now inhospitable coast. <HI>Waynfleet,</HI> once a noted haven, is at present a mere creek. <HI>Skegness,</HI> once a large walled town, with a good harbour, is now an inconsiderable place a mile from the sea: and the port of
<PB N="VIII" REF="18"/>
<HI>Grimesby,</HI> which in the time of <HI>Edward</HI> III. furnished him with eleven ships, is now totally choaked with sand.</P>
<P>The <HI>Great Level,</HI> which comprehends <HI>Holland</HI> in this county, with part of <HI>Northamptonshire, Norfolk, Suffolk, Cambridge,</HI> and <HI>Huntingdon,</HI> a tract of sixty com∣puted miles in length, and forty in breadth, had been originally a wooded country. Whole forests of firs and oaks have been found in digging, far beneath the moor, on the solid ground; oaks fifteen feet in girth, and sixteen yards long, mostly burnt at the bottoms, the antient method of falling them: multitudes of others entirely rooted up, as appears, by the force of the sea bursting in and overwhelming this whole tract, and covering it with <HI>silt,</HI> or the mud which it carried with it from time to time. <HI>Ovid</HI>'s beautiful account of the deluge was here verified; for under <HI>Conington Down,</HI> in <HI>Huntingdonshire,</HI> was found the skeleton of a whale near twenty feet long, which had once swam secure to this distance from its native residence.</P>

<P>In process of time this tract underwent another revolution. The <HI>silt</HI> or mud gained so considerably as to leave vast spaces dry, and other parts so shallow as to encourage the <HI>Romans</HI> to regain these fertilized countries from the sea. Those sen∣sible and indefatigable people first taught us the art of embanking, and recovered the valuable lands we now possess. It was the complaint of <HI>Galgacus,</HI> that they ex∣hausted the strength of the <HI>Britons, in sylvis et paludibus emuniendis</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vita Agricolae.</NOTE>, 'in clearing woods and draining marshes.' After the <HI>Romans</HI> deserted our island, another change took place. Neglect of their labors succeeded: the drains were neglected, and the whole became fen and shallow lake, resembling the present east fen; the haunt of myriads of water-fowl, or the retreat of banditti. <HI>Ely</HI> and many little tracts which had the advantage of elevation, were at that period literally islands. Several of these in early times became the retreat of religious. <HI>Ely, Thorney, Ramsey, Spiney,</HI> and others, rose into celebrated abbies, and by the industry of their inhabi∣tants first began to restore the works of the <HI>Romans.</HI> The country above <HI>Thorney</HI> is represented by an old historian <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Malmsbury,</HI> lib. iv. 294.</NOTE> as a paradise. Constant visitations, founded on wholesome laws, preserved this vast recovered country: but on the rapid and ra∣pacious dissolution, the removal of numbers of the inhabitants, and the neglect of the laws of the <HI>Sewers,</HI> the drains were filled, the cultivated land overflowed, and
<PB N="IX" REF="19"/>
the country again reduced to a useless morass<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Compare Sir <HI>W. Dugdale</HI>'s maps of this tract, in its morassy and drained state. <HI>Hist. Embank.</HI> p. 375. 416.</NOTE>. In the twentieth of <HI>Elizabeth</HI> the state of the country was taken into consideration<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Same, p. 375.</NOTE>; no great matters were done till the time of <HI>Francis,</HI> and <HI>William</HI> his son, earls of <HI>Bedford,</HI> who attempted this <HI>Herculean</HI> work, and reclamed this vast tract of more than three hundred thousand acres; and the last received, under sanction of parlement, the just reward of ninety thousand acres. I speak not of the reliques of the antient banks which I have seen in <HI>Holland, Lincolnshire,</HI> now remote from the sea, nor yet of the <HI>Roman</HI> tumuli, the coins, and other evidences of the residence of that nation in these parts; they would swell a mere preface to too great a length: and, it is to be hoped, will be under∣taken by the pen of some native, who will perform it from his actual survey.</P>
<P>The vast fenny tracts of these counties were in old times the haunts of multi∣tudes of water-fowl; but the happy change, by attention to draining, has substitut∣ed in their place thousands of sheep; or, instead of reeds, made those tracts laugh with corn. The Crane, which once abounded in these parts, has even deserted our island. The Common Wild Duck still breeds in multitudes in the unreclamed parts; and thousands are sent annually to the <HI>London</HI> markets, from the numerous decoys. The Grey Lag Goose, <HI>Br. Zool.</HI> ii. N<SUP>o</SUP> 266, the origin of the Tame, breeds here, and is resident the whole year: a few others of the Duck kind breed here. Ruffs, Redshanks, Lapwings, Red-breasted Godwits, and Whimbrels, are found here during summer; but, with their young, in autumn, disperse about the island. The Short-eared Owl migrates here with the Woodcock, and is a welcome guest to the farmer, by clearing the fields of mice. Knots swarm on the coasts in winter: are taken in numbers in nets: yet none are seen during summer<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Tour in Scotland,</HI> 1769; <HI>Lincolnshire,</HI> where the fen birds are enumerated.</NOTE>. The most distant north is probably the retreat of the multitude of water-fowl of each order which stock our shores, driven southward by the extreme cold: most of them regularly, others, whose nature enables them to brave the usual winters of the frigid zone, are with us only accidental guests, and in seasons when the frost rages in their native land with unusual severity.</P>
<P>From <HI>Clea Ness,</HI> the land retires westward, and, with the opposite shore of <HI>Yorkshire,</HI> bounds the great estuary of the <HI>Humber,</HI> which, winding deep into the country, is the receptacle of the <HI>Trent,</HI> and all the considerable rivers of that vast province; some of which arise in its most remote parts. All these coasts of <HI>Lincolnshire</HI> are flat, and have been gained from the sea. <HI>Barton</HI> and <HI>Barrow</HI> have not at present the least appearance of ports; yet by <HI>Holinshed</HI> were styled good ones<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Descr. Britain, <HI>108.</HI></NOTE>. Similar

accidents have befallen the upper part of the low tract of <HI>Holderness,</HI> which faces the congruent shores. <HI>Hedon,</HI> a few miles below <HI>Hull,</HI> several hundred years ago a port of great commerce, is now a mile and a half from the water, and has long given way to the rising fortune of the latter (a creation of <HI>Edward</HI> I. in 1296) on account of the excellency of its port. But in return, the sea has made most ample reprisals on the lands of this hundred: the site, and even the very names of several places, once towns of note upon the <HI>Humber,</HI> are now only recorded in history: and <HI>Ravensper</HI> was at one time a rival to <HI>Hull</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Madox. Ant. Exch. <HI>i. 422.</HI></NOTE>; and a port so very considerable in 1332, that <HI>Edward Baliol</HI> and the confederated <HI>English</HI> barons sailed from hence with a great fleet to invade <HI>Scotland;</HI> and <HI>Henry</HI> IV. in 1399, made choice of this port to land at, to effect the deposal of <HI>Richard</HI> II. yet the whole of it has long since been devoured by the merciless ocean: extensive sands, dry at low water, are to be seen in their stead; except <HI>Sunk Island,</HI> which, till about the year 1666, appeared among them like an elevated shoal, at which period it was regained, by embankments, from the sea; and now forms a considerable estate, probably restored to its pristine condition.</P>
<P><HI>Spurn Head,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">SPURN HEAD.</NOTE> the <HI>Ocelum Promontorium</HI> of <HI>Ptolemy,</HI> terminates this side of the <HI>Hum∣ber,</HI> at present in form of a sickle, near which the wind-bound ships anchor securely. The place on which the lighthouses stand is a vast beach near two miles long, mixed with sand-hills flung up by the sea within the last seventy years.</P>
<P>The land from hence for some miles is composed of very lofty cliffs of brown clay, perpetually preyed on by the fury of the <HI>German</HI> sea, which devours whole acres at a time, and exposes on the shores considerable quantities of beautiful amber. Fine wheat grows on the clay, even to the edge of the cliffs. A country of the same fertility reaches from <HI>Kilnsey,</HI> near this place, as far as the village of <HI>Sprottly,</HI> ex∣tending, in a waved form, for numbers of miles; and, when I saw it, richly cloathed with wheat and beans.</P>
<P>From near <HI>Kilnsey</HI> the land bends very gently inward, as far as the great promon∣tory of <HI>Flamborough;</HI> and is a continuance of high clayey cliff, till about the village of <HI>Hornsey.</HI> Near it is a mere, noted for its Eels and Pikes, at present sepa∣rated from the sea by so small a space as to render its speedy destruction very proba∣ble. A street, called <HI>Hornsey Beck,</HI> has long since been swallowed: and of <HI>Hide,</HI> a neighboring town, only the tradition is left.</P>
<P>The country grows considerably lower; and, near the base of the promon∣tory, retires so far in as to form <HI>Bridlington</HI> bay,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BRIDLINGTON BAY.</NOTE> antiently called <HI>Gabrantovicorum Sinus,</HI> to which the Geographer adds <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, on account of the excellency and

safety of its port, where vessels ride in full security under the shelter of the lofty head-land. <HI>Smithie</HI> sand, the only one between <HI>Flamborough</HI> and <HI>Spurn Head,</HI> stretches across the entrance into <HI>Bridlington</HI> bay, and, in hard gales from the north and north-east, adds to the security of that noble asylum for the coasting vessels. <HI>Sureby,</HI> an adjacent village, seems no more than a translation from the old appellation. The <HI>Romans,</HI> in all probability, had a naval station here; for here ends the road, visible in many places between this place and <HI>York,</HI> and named, from its founders, the <HI>Roman ridge.</HI></P>
<P>The head is formed of lime-stone, of a snowy whiteness<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Soft near the top, and of a crumbling quality when exposed long to the frost. At the foot of the cliff it is hard, solid, and smooth. Boats are employed every summer in carrying great quantities to <HI>Sunderland,</HI> where it is burnt into excellent lime. Most of the lime-stone used at <HI>Scarborough</HI> is made from stones flung up by the sea. It may be remarked, that whatsoever degree of hardness any lime∣stone possesses in the quarry, the mortar made from it, by proper management, may be made as hard, but by no means harder. Most of the houses in and about <HI>London</HI> are built with lime made of chalk; hence the many miserable casualties there, by the fall of houses. The workmen, sensible of the weakness of that kind of mortar, endeavour to keep the walls together by lodging frames of timber in them; which being consumed in cases of fire, the whole building tumbles suddenly, and renders all attempts to ex∣tinguish the fire very dangerous.—Mr. <HI>Travis.</HI></NOTE>,<NOTE PLACE="marg">FLAMBOROUGH HEAD.</NOTE> of a stupendous height, and vast magnificence, visible far at sea. If we may depend on <HI>Richard</HI> of <HI>Cirencester,</HI> the <HI>Romans</HI> named it <HI>Brigantum Extrema,</HI> and the bay <HI>Portus Felix.</HI> The <HI>Saxons</HI> styled the cape <HI>Fleamburg,</HI> perhaps from the lights which directed the great <HI>Ida,</HI> founder of the <HI>Northumberland</HI> kingdom, to land here, in 547, with a great body of their countrymen.</P>
<P>The vast height of the precipices, and the amazing grandeur of the caverns which open on the north side, giving wide and solemn admission, through most exalted arches, into the body of the mountain; together with the gradual decline of light, the deep silence of the place unless interrupted by the striking of the oar, the collision of a swelling wave against the sides, or the loud flutter of the pigeons affrighted from their nests in the distant roof; afford pleasures of scenery which such formations as this alone can yield. These also are wonderfully diversified. In some parts the caverns penetrate far, and end in darkness; in others are per∣vious, and give a romantic passage by another opening equally superb. Many of the rocks are insulated, of a pyramidal form, and soar to a great height. The bases of most are solid; but in some pierced through and arched. All are covered with the dung of the innumerable flocks of migratory birds which resort here annually to breed, and fill every little projection, every hole, which will give them leave to rest. Multitudes were swimming about; others swarmed in the air, and stunned us with

the variety of their croaks and screams. Kittiwakes and Herring Gulls, Guille∣mots and Black Guillemots, Auks, Puffins, Shags, and Corvorants, are among the species which resort hither. The notes of all sea-fowl are most harsh and inhar∣monious. I have often rested under rocks like these, attentive to the various founds over my head; which, mixed with the deep roar of the waves slowly swelling, and retiring from the vast caverns beneath, have produced a fine effect. The sharp voice of the Gulls, the frequent chatter of the Guillemots, the loud notes of the Auks, the scream of the Herons, together with the deep periodical croak of the Corvorants, which serves as a bass to the rest, have often furnished me with a con∣cert; which, joined to the wild scenery surrounding me, afforded in an high degree that species of pleasure which results from the novelty and the gloomy majesty of the entertainment.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">ROCKY COASTS BEGIN.</NOTE>At <HI>Flamborough</HI> head commence the hard or rocky coasts of this side of <HI>Great Bri∣tain,</HI> which continue, with the interruption of a few sandy bays and low land, to the extremity of the kingdom. It often happens, that the bottom of the sea partakes of the nature of the neighboring element: thus, about the head, and a few miles to the northward (in places) the shores are rocky, and the haunts of lobsters and other crustaceous animals. From these strata a tract of fine sand, from one to five miles in breadth, extends sloping eastward, and from its edge to that of the <HI>Dogger-bank</HI> is a deep bottom, rugged, rocky, and cavernous, and in most parts overgrown with corallines and submarine plants.</P>
<P>This disposition of shore gives to the inhabitants of this coast the advantageous fishery which they possess; for the shore on one hand, and the edges of the <HI>Dogger-bank</HI> on the other, like the sides of a decoy, give a direction to the im∣mense shoals of the Cod genus, which annually migrate from the northern ocean, to visit, reside, and spawn, in the parts adjacent to our coasts. They find plenty of food from the plants of the rocks, and the worms of the sand, and secure shelter for their spawn in the cavernous part of the scarry bottom. It is in the channel between the banks and the shores, in which the Cod are taken, or in the hollows between the <HI>Doggers</HI> and <HI>Well-bank;</HI> for they do not like the agita∣tion of the water on the shallows. On the contrary, the Skates, the Holibuts, Flounders, and other flat fish, bury themselves in the sand; and secure themselves from the turbulence of the waves.</P>
<P>An amazing shoal of Haddocks visit this coast periodically, generally about the tenth of <HI>December,</HI> and extend from the shore near three miles in breadth, and in length from <HI>Flamborough</HI> head to <HI>Tinmouth</HI> castle, perhaps further north. An army of a small species of Shark, the PICKED, <HI>Br. Zool.</HI> iii. N<SUP>o</SUP> 40, flanks the outside of this shoal to prey upon it; for when the fishermen cast their lines

<P>The <HI>Tees,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">TEES.</NOTE> the northern limit of this great county, opens with a wide mouth and mudded bottom into the sea. This was the <HI>Dunum Estuarium</HI> of <HI>Ptolemy;</HI> and serves as a brief entrance for navigators into the country. Almost all the northern rivers descend with a rapid course, from their mountanous rise and sup∣ply; and afford but a short navigation. From hence the lead of the mineral parts of <HI>Durham,</HI> and the corn of its more level parts, are imported. In the mud of this estuary, more particularly, abounds the <HI>Myxine Glutinosa</HI> of <HI>Linnaeus,</HI> the <HI>Hag</HI> of the neighboring fishermen; a worm, which enters the mouths of the fish taken on hooks, that remain a tide under water, and devours the whole, leaving only the skin and bones. This also is the worm which converts water into a sort of glue.</P>
<P>From <HI>Seaton Snook,</HI> in the bishoprick of <HI>Durham,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">DURHAM.</NOTE> to <HI>Hartlepool,</HI> is a series of sand-banks, and the shore a long-continued sandy shallow. From the <HI>Ness Point</HI> of <HI>Hartleppol</HI> to <HI>Blackhalls</HI> is a rocky lime-stone coast, with frequent inter∣vals of sand-bank, and a stony beach; but <HI>Seham</HI> and <HI>Hartlepool</HI> is so very rugged, that no enemy could land, or even stand off the shore, without the most imminent danger: in particular, the coasts about <HI>Hawthorn Hive</HI> are bold, excavated, and formed into grotesque figures, for several miles, and the shores rough with a broken and heavy sea, by reason of the hidden rocks and spits of sands which run out far
<PB N="XIV" REF="24"/>
from land. From <HI>Seham</HI> to <HI>Sunderland</HI> are sand-hills and shallow sandy beaches. From <HI>Weremouth</HI> to near <HI>Cleadon,</HI> low rocks of lime-stone form the coast, here and there intersected with sand-hills and stony beaches. From thence to the mouth of the <HI>Tyne,</HI> and even to <HI>Dunstanbrough</HI> in <HI>Northumberland;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">NORTHUMBER∣LAND.</NOTE> the shore is sandy, and the land in a few places rocky; but from thence to <HI>Bamborough,</HI> the coasts are high and rocky, in many places run far into the sea, and at low tides shew their heads above water.</P>
<P><HI>Bamborough</HI> castle stands on the last of the range of rocky cliffs. This fortress was founded by the <HI>Saxon</HI> monarch <HI>Ida.</HI> After various fortunes it, has proved in its dismantled state of more use to mankind than when it boasted some potent lord and fierce warders. A charitable prelate of the fee of <HI>Durham</HI> purchased the estate, and left it for the use of the distressed seamen who might suffer ship∣wreck on this dangerous coast, and to unconfined charitable purposes, at the dis∣cretion of certain trustees. The poor are, in the dearest seasons, supplied with corn at a cheap rate; the wrecked, found senseless and benumbed with cold, are taken instantly into these hospitable walls, and restored to life by the assistance of food, medicine, and warm beds; and if the ship is capable of relief, that also is saved, by means of machines always ready for the purpose<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tour in Scotland, <HI>1769; and fuller in Mr.</HI> Hutchinson's Northumberland, <HI>ii. 176.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The <HI>Farn islands,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">FARN ISLES.</NOTE> or rather rocks, form a group at no great distance from shore; the nearest a mile and sixty-eight chains; the farthest about seven. These probably, at some remote period, have been convulsed from the land, but now divided from it by a furious tide, rushing through a channel from five to twelve fathoms in depth. The original sea, to the east of the <HI>Staples,</HI> the remotest rocks, suddenly deepens to forty or fifty<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Adair. Hammond. Thompson.</NOTE>. <HI>St. Cuthbert</HI> first made these rocks of note: he occasionally made the largest of them the seat of his devotion and seclusion from the world; expelling, says superstition, the malignant spirits, the pre-oc∣cupants. Some remains of a chapel are still to be seen on it. For ages past, the sole tenants are a few cows, wafted over from the main land in the little cobles, or boats of the country; and the Eider Ducks, <HI>Arct. Zool.</HI> ii. N<SUP>o</SUP> 480, still distinguished here by the name of the Saint. Numberless sea-fowls, and of great variety of kinds, possess the remoter rocks, on which they find a more secure retreat than on the low-cliffed shores. To the marine feathered tribe the whole coast from <HI>Flamborough</HI> head to that of <HI>St. Ebb's</HI> is inhospitable. They seek the loftiest promontories. Where you hear of the haunts of the Razor-bills and Guillemots, Corvorants and Shags, you may be well assured, that
<PB N="XV" REF="25"/>
the cliffs soar to a distinguished height. Where those are wanting, they retire to sea-girt rocks, as spots the lest accessible to mankind. The five species of Auks and Guillemots appear in spring, and vanish in autumn: the other birds preserve their native haunts, or spread along the neighboring shores.</P>
<P>From <HI>Bamborough</HI> to the mouth of the <HI>Tweed</HI> is a sandy shore, narrowing as it approaches our sister kingdom. <HI>Lindesfarn,</HI> or the <HI>Holy island,</HI> with its ruined cathedral and castle, lie remote from shore, accessible at every recess of tide, and possibly divided from <HI>Northumberland</HI> by the power of the waves in distant ages. The tides do not swell over this tract in the usual manner of apparent flow∣ing and gradual approach; but ooze gently out of every part of the sand, which at first appears a quaggy extent, then, to the terror of the traveller, surrounds him with a shining plain of smooth unruffled water, reflecting the varied land∣scapes of the adjoining shores<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Hutchinson,</HI> ii. 151.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The <HI>Tweed,</HI> the antient <HI>Alaunus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">SCOTLAND.</NOTE> a narrow geographical boundary between us and our fellow-subjects the <HI>Scottish</HI> nation, next succeeds. After a short conti∣nuance of low land, <HI>St. Ebb's head,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">ST. EBB'S HEAD.</NOTE> a lofty promontory, projects into the sea (frequented in the season by Razor-bills, Guillemots, and all the birds of the <HI>Bass,</HI> excepting the Gannet) and its lower part is hollowed into most august caverns. This, with <HI>Fifeness,</HI> about thirty miles distant, forms the entrance into that magnificent estuary the firth of <HI>Forth,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">FIRTH OF FORTH.</NOTE> which extends inland sixty miles; and, with the canal from <HI>Carron</HI> to the firth of <HI>Clyde,</HI> intirely insulates the antient <HI>Caledonia.</HI> The isle of <HI>May</HI> appears near the northern side of the entrance; the vast towering rock, the <HI>Bass,</HI> lies near the southern. This lofty island is the summer resort of birds innumerable, which, after discharging the first duty of nature, seek, with their young, other shores or other climates. This is one of the few spots in the northern hemisphere on which the Gannets nestle. Their size, their snowy plumage, their easy flight, and their precipitate plunge after their prey, distinguish them at once from all the rest of the feathered tenants of the isle, the Corvorants and Auks, the flights of whom are rapid, and the Gulls, which move with sluggish wing.</P>
<P>Near the <HI>Bass</HI> the entrance narrows, then opens, and bending inwards, forms on each side a noble bay. The <HI>Firth</HI> contracts to a very narrow streight at <HI>Queensferry;</HI> then winds beautifully, till it terminates beyond <HI>Alloa,</HI> in the river to which it owes its name. The shores are low, in part rocky, in part a plea∣sant beach; but every where of matchless beauty and population. <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> the capital, rises with true grandeur near the shore, with its port, the great em∣porium,
<PB N="XVI" REF="26"/>
<HI>Leith,</HI> beneath, where the spring-tides sometimes rise fifteen and sixteen feet, and to seventeen or eighteen when the water is forced up the firth by a violent wind from the north-east. Almost every league of this great estuary is terminated with towns or villages, the effects of trade and industry. The ele∣gant description of the coast of <HI>Fife,</HI> left us by <HI>Johnston</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Tour in Scotland,</HI> 1772. part ii. p. 212.</NOTE>, is far from being ex∣aggerated; and may, with equal justice, be applied to each shore.</P>
<P>FIFESHIRE, bounded by the firths of <HI>Forth</HI> and <HI>Tay,</HI> projects far into the sea; a country flourishing by its industry, and happy in numbers of ports, natural, artificial, or improved. Coal and lime, the native productions of the county, are exported in vast quantities. Excepting the unimportant colliery in <HI>Suther∣land,</HI> those at <HI>Largo Wood,</HI> midway between the bay and <HI>St. Andrews,</HI> are the last on this side of <HI>North Britain.</HI> The coasts in general of this vast province are rocky and precipitous; but far from being lofty. The bays, particularly the beautiful one of <HI>Largo,</HI> are finely bounded by gravelly or sandy shores; and the land, in most parts, rises high to the middle of the county. Towards the northern end, the river <HI>Edin;</HI> and its little bay, by similarity of sound point out the <HI>Tinna</HI> of the old geographer.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">FIRTH OF TAY.</NOTE>The estuary of the <HI>Tay</HI> limits the north of <HI>Fifeshire.</HI> Before the mouth extends the sand retaining the <HI>British</HI> name of <HI>Aber-tay,</HI> or the place where the <HI>Tay</HI> dis∣charges itself into the sea. The <HI>Romans</HI> preserved the antient name, and Latinized it into <HI>Tava.</HI> The entrance, at <HI>Brough-tay</HI> castle, is about three quarters of a mile wide; after which it expands, and goes about fourteen miles up the coun∣try before it assumes the form of a river. At the recess of the tides there ap∣pears a vast extent of sands, and a very shallow channel; but the high tides waft, even as high as <HI>Perth,</HI> vessels of a hundred and twenty tons. The shores are low, and the ground rises gently inland on the southern side: on the north it continues low, till it arrives at the foot of the <HI>Grampian</HI> hills, many miles distant. In some remote age the sea extended on the north side far beyond its present bounds. At a considerable distance above the flourishing port of <HI>Dundee,</HI> and remote inland, anchors have been found deep in the soil<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Douglas's East Coast of Scotland, <HI>14.</HI></NOTE>. When these parts were deserted by the sea, it is probable that some opposite country was devoured by an inundation, which occasioned this partial desertion.</P>
<P>From thence to <HI>Aberbrothic,</HI> in the shire of <HI>Angus,</HI> noted for the venerable re∣mains of its abbey, is a low and sandy shore. From <HI>Aberbrothic</HI> almost to <HI>Mon∣trose,</HI> arises a bold rocky coast, lofty and precipitous, except where interrupted by the beautiful semicircular bay of <HI>Lunan.</HI> Several of the cliffs are penetrated by
<PB N="XVII" REF="27"/>
most amazing caverns; some open into the sea with a narrow entrance, and in∣ternally instantly rise into high and spacious vaults, and so extensively meandring, that no one as yet has had the courage to explore the end. The entrance of others shame the work of art in the noblest of the <HI>Gothic</HI> cathedrals. A mag∣nificent portal appears divided in the middle by a great column, the basis of which sinks deep in the water. Thus the voyager may pass on one side in his boat, survey the wonders within, and return by the opposite side.</P>
<P>The cavern called the <HI>Geylit-pot,</HI> almost realises in form a fable in the <HI>Persian</HI> Tales. The hardy adventurer may make a long subterraneous voyage, with a picturesque scenery of rock above and on every side. He may be rowed in this solemn scene till he finds himself suddenly restored to the sight of the heavens: he finds himself in a circular chasm, open to the day, with a narrow bottom and extensive top, widening at the margin to the diameter of two hundred feet. On attaining the summit, he finds himself at a distance from the sea, amidst corn∣fields or verdant pastures, with a fine view of the country, and a gentleman's seat near to the place from which he had emerged. Such may be the amusement of the curious in summer calms! but when the storms are directed from the east, the view from the edge of this hollow is tremendous; for, from the height of above three hundred feet, they may look down on the furious waves, whitened with foam, and swelling from their confined passage.</P>
<P>Peninsulated rocks often jut from the face of the cliff's, precipitous on their sides, and washed by a great depth of water. The isthmus which joins them to the land, is often so extremely narrow as to render it impassable for more than two or three persons a-breast; but the tops spread into verdant areas, containing vestiges of rude fortifications, in antient and barbarous times the retreat of the neighboring inhabitants from the rage of a potent invader<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">These descriptions borrowed from my own <HI>Tours.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P><HI>Montrose,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">MONTROSE.</NOTE> peninsulated by the sea, and the bason its beautiful harbour, stands on a bed of sand and gravel. The tide rushing furiously through a narrow en∣trance twice in twenty-four hours, fills the port with a depth of water sufficient to bring in vessels of large burden. Unfortunately, at the ebb they must lie dry; for none exceeding sixty tons can at that period float, and those only in the chan∣nel of the <HI>South Esk,</HI> which, near <HI>Montrose,</HI> discharges itself into the sea.</P>
<P>A sandy coast is continued for a small distance from <HI>Montrose.</HI> Rude rocky cliffs re-commence in the county of <HI>Merns,</HI> and front the ocean. Among the highest is <HI>Fowls-heugh,</HI> noted for the resort of multitudes of sea-birds. <HI>Bervie</HI> and <HI>Stonehive</HI> are two small ports overhung with rocks; and on the summit of a
<PB N="XVIII" REF="28"/>
most exalted one, are the vast ruins of <HI>Dunnoter,</HI> once the property of the warlike family of the <HI>Keiths.</HI> The rocks adjacent to it, like the preceding, assume various and grotesque forms.</P>
<P>A little farther the antient <HI>Deva,</HI> or <HI>Dee,</HI> opens into the sea, after forming a harbour to the fine and flourishing town of <HI>Aberdeen.</HI> A sandy coast continues for numbers of miles, part of which is so moveable as almost totally to have over∣whelmed the parish of <HI>Furvie:</HI> two farms only exist, out of an estate, in 1600, va∣lued at five hundred pounds a year.</P>
<P>A majestic rocky coast appears again. The <HI>Bullers</HI> of <HI>Buchan,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">BULLERS OF BUCHAN.</NOTE> and the noble arched rock, so finely represented by the pencil of the Reverend Mr. <HI>Cordiner</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Antiquities and Scenery of Scotland, <HI>letter vi. plates ii. iii.</HI></NOTE>, are justly esteemed the wonders of this country. The former is an amazing harbour, with an entrance through a most august arch of great height and length. The inside is a secure bason, environed on every side by mural rocks: the whole projects far from the main land, and is bounded on each side by deep creeks; so that the traveller who chuses to walk round the narrow battlements, ought first to be well assured of the strength of his head.</P>
<P>A little farther is <HI>Peterhead,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">PETERHEAD.</NOTE> the most eastern port of <HI>Scotland,</HI> the common retreat of wind-bound ships; and a port which fully merits the attention of go∣vernment, to render it more secure. <HI>Kinnaird-head,</HI> the <HI>Taizalum promontorium,</HI> lies a little farther north, and, with the north-eastern extremity of <HI>Cathness,</HI> forms the firth of <HI>Murray,</HI> the <HI>Tua Aestuarium,</HI> a bay of vast extent. <HI>Troup-head</HI> is an∣other vast cape,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CAVERNS AND SINGULAR ROCKS:</NOTE> to the west of the former. The caverns and rocks of that pro∣montory yield to none in magnificence and singularity of shape: of the latter, some emulate the form of lofty towers, others of inclining pyramids with central arches,<NOTE PLACE="marg">HOW FORMED.</NOTE> pervious to boats. The figures of these are the effect of chance, and owing to the collision of the waves, which wearing away the earth and crumbly parts, leave them the just subjects of our admiration. Sea-plants, shells, and va∣rious sorts of marine exsanguious animals, cloath their bases, washed by a deep and clear sea; and their summits resound with the various clang of the feathered tribe.</P>
<P>From hence the bay is bounded on the south by the extensive and rich plains of <HI>Murray.</HI> The shore wants not its wild beauties. The view of the noble cavern, called the rocks of Caussie, on the shore between <HI>Burgh-head</HI> and <HI>Lossie</HI> mouth, drawn by Mr. <HI>Cordiner,</HI> fully evinces the assertion. The bottom of the bay closes with the firth of <HI>Inverness,</HI> from whence to the <HI>Atlantic</HI> ocean is a chain of rivers, lakes, and bays, with the interruption only of two miles of land between <HI>Loch-oich</HI> and <HI>Loch∣lochy.</HI> Unite those two lakes by a canal, and the rest of <HI>North Britain</HI> would be completely insulated.</P>
<P><PB REF="29"/><FIGURE>

<P><PB N="XIX" REF="30"/>To the north the firth of <HI>Cromartie,</HI> and the firth of <HI>Tayne,</HI> the <HI>Vara Aestua∣rium,</HI> penetrate deep into the land. From <HI>Dornoch,</HI> the coast of <HI>Sutherland</HI> is low and sandy, except in a few places: one, at the water of <HI>Brora,</HI> is distinguish∣ed by the beauty of the rocky scenery; in the midst of which the river precipi∣tates itself into the sea, down a lofty precipice. The <HI>Scottish Alps,</HI> which hereto∣fore kept remote from the shore, now approach very near; and at the great pro∣montory, the <HI>Ripa Alta</HI> of <HI>Ptolemy,</HI> the <HI>Ord,</HI> i. e. <HI>Aird</HI> of <HI>Cathness,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">ORD OF CATH∣NESS.</NOTE> or the <HI>Height</HI> of <HI>Cathness,</HI> terminate in a most sublime and abrupt manner in the sea. The upper part is covered with gloomy heath; the lower is a stupendous precipice, ex∣cavated into vast caverns, the haunt of Seals and different sea-fowl. On the eastern side of the kingdom, this is the striking termination of the vast mountains of <HI>Scotland,</HI> which form its Highlands, the habitation of the original inhabitants,<NOTE PLACE="marg">HIGHLAND ALPS.</NOTE> driven from their antient seats by the ancestors of Lowland <HI>Scots,</HI> descendants of <HI>Saxons, French,</HI> and <HI>Normans,</HI> congenerous with the <HI>English,</HI> yet absurdly and invidiously distinguished from them. Language, as well as striking natural boundaries, mark their place. Their mountains face on the west the <HI>Atlantic</HI> ocean; wind along the west of <HI>Cathness;</HI> among which <HI>Morvern</HI> and <HI>Scaraben, Ben-Hop</HI> and <HI>Ben-Lugal</HI> arise pre-eminent. <HI>Sutherland</HI> is entirely <HI>Alpine,</HI> as are <HI>Ross-shire</HI> and <HI>Inverness-shire.</HI> Their <HI>Summae Alpes</HI> are, <HI>Meal Fourvounich,</HI> the <HI>Cory∣arich, Benewish,</HI> and <HI>Benevish</HI> near <HI>Fort William;</HI> the last of which is reported to be fourteen hundred and fifty yards in height. Great part of <HI>Aberdeenshire</HI> lies in this tract. It boasts of another <HI>Morvern,</HI> soaring far beyond the others: this is in the centre of the <HI>Grampian hills,</HI> and perhaps the highest from the sea of any in <HI>Great Britain.</HI> They again comprehend the eastern part of <HI>Perth∣shire,</HI> and finish on the magnificent shores of <HI>Loch-lomond,</HI> on the western side of which <HI>Ben-lomond</HI> rises, distinguished among its fellows. From hence the rest of <HI>North Britain</HI> forms a chain of humbler hills; but in <HI>Cumberland,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">ENGLISH.</NOTE> part of <HI>West∣moreland, Yorkshire, Lancashire,</HI> and <HI>Derbyshire,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">CAMBRIAN.</NOTE> the <HI>Alps</HI> resume their former ma∣jesty. A long and tame interval succeeds. The long sublime tract of <HI>Wales</HI> arises, the antient possession of the antient <HI>British</HI> race. From the <HI>Ord,</HI> the great mountains recede inland, and leave a vast flat between their bases and the sea, fronting the waves with a series of lofty rocky precipices, as far as the little creek of <HI>Staxigo;</HI> the whole a bold, but most inhospitable shore for shipping. <HI>Wick</HI> and <HI>Staxigo</HI> have indeed their creeks, or rather chasms, which open between the cliffs, and may accidentally prove a retreat, unless in an eastern gale.</P>
<P><HI>Sinclair</HI> and <HI>Freswick</HI> bays are sandy, and afford safe anchorage: from the last the country rises into lofty cliffs, many composed of small strata of stones, as re∣gular as a mason could lay them; and before them rise insulated stacks or co∣lumns
<PB N="XX" REF="31"/>
of similar materials, some hollowed into arches; others, pillar-like, aspire in heights equal to the land<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Mr. <HI>Cordiner</HI>'s beautiful view of a stack of this kind, tab. xv.</NOTE> These are animated with birds. All their oeco∣nomy may be viewed with ease from the neighboring cliffs; their loves, incuba∣tion, exclusion, and nutrition.</P>
<P><HI>Dungsby-head,</HI> the antient <HI>Berubium,</HI> terminates the eastern side of this kingdom, as <HI>Far-out-head,</HI> the old <HI>Tarvedum,</HI> does the western. <HI>Strathy-head,</HI> the <HI>Verve∣drum</HI> of <HI>Ptolemy,</HI> lies intermediate. The whole tract faces the north, and con∣sists of various noted headlands, giving shelter to numerous bays, many of which penetrate deep into the country. Let me make this general remark,—that nature hath, with a niggardly hand, dealt out her harbours to the eastern coasts of the <HI>British</HI> isles; but shewn a profusion on their western sides. What numberless lochs, with great depth of water, wind into the western counties of <HI>Scotland,</HI> over-shadowed and sheltered by lofty mountains! and what multitudes of noble har∣bours do the western provinces of <HI>Ireland</HI> open into the immense <HI>Atlantic</HI> ocean!</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">GERMAN OR NORTH SEA.</NOTE>The sea which washes the shores of <HI>Britain,</HI> which have passed under my re∣view, was originally called, by one of the antients<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mela.</NOTE>, <HI>Oceanus Britannicus,</HI> form∣ing part of that vast expanse which surrounds our islands. <HI>Pliny</HI> confined that title to the space between the mouth of the <HI>Rhine</HI> and that of the <HI>Seine;</HI> and be∣stowed on this sea the name of <HI>Septentrionalis</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Plin.</HI> lib. iv. c. 19.</NOTE>; and <HI>Ptolemy</HI> called it <HI>Germa∣nicus:</HI> both which it still retains.

The coasts from <HI>Dungsby-head</HI> to <HI>Flamborough-head</HI> are bold and high,<NOTE PLACE="marg">NAVIGATION.</NOTE> and may be seen at sea from seven to fourteen leagues: from the last to <HI>Spurn-head</HI> is also a clear coast; but the rest of the coast of <HI>Norfolk</HI> and <HI>Suffolk</HI> is low, visible at small distance, and rendered dangerous by the number of sand-banks projecting far to sea. After passing the <HI>Spurn-head,</HI> navigators steer between the inner and outer <HI>Dousings,</HI> for the <HI>floating light</HI> kept on board a small vessel (constructed for that purpose) always anchored at the inner edge of a sand called <HI>Dogshon's Shoal,</HI> about eight leagues from the coast of <HI>Lincolnshire,</HI> in about fifteen fathom water. From thence they make for <HI>Cromer</HI> in <HI>Norfolk;</HI> and from that point, till they arrive at the <HI>Nore,</HI> their track is all the way through a number of narrow chan∣nels near the most dangerous sands: to which, if we add foggy weather, dark nights, storms, contrary winds, and very near adjacent lee-shores, it may be very fairly reckoned the most dangerous of the much-frequented navigations in the world.</P>
<P>But fortunately, to the north of these,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SAND-BANKS.</NOTE> this sea is much more remarkable for sand-banks of utility than of danger, and would never have been observed but for the multitudes of fishes which, at different seasons, according to their species, resort to their sides, from the great northern deeps, either for the sake of variety of food which they yield, or to depose their spawn in security. The first to be taken notice of does not come within the description, yet should not be passed over in silence, as it comes within the natural history of the <HI>North</HI> sea. An anonymous sand runs across the channel between <HI>Buchan-ness</HI> and the north end of <HI>Juts-riff:</HI> the left depth of water over it is forty fathoms; so that it would scarcely be thought of, did not the water suddenly deepen again, and form that place which is styled the <HI>Buchan deeps.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Long Bank,</HI> or the <HI>Long Fortys,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">LONG FORTYS.</NOTE> bears E. S. E. from <HI>Buchan-ness,</HI> about forty-five miles distant, and extends southward as far as opposite to <HI>Newcastle;</HI> is about fifty leagues in length, and seven in breadth; and has on it from thirty-two to forty-five fathoms of water. The ground is a coarse gravel, mixed with marine plants, and is esteemed a good fishing bank.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mar Bank</HI> lies between the former and the shore opposite to <HI>Berwick;</HI> is oval, about fifteen miles long, and has about twenty-six fathom of water, and round it about forty.</P>
<P>The bank called <HI>Montrose Pits</HI> lies a little to the east of the middle of the <HI>Long Fortys.</HI> It is about fifty miles long,<NOTE PLACE="marg">MONTROSE PITS.</NOTE> and most remarkable for five great pits or hol∣lows, from three to four miles in diameter: on their edges is only forty fathom water; yet they suddenly deepen to seventy, and even a hundred fathom, on a soft muddy bottom: the margins on the contrary are gravelly. I enquired whether the
<PB N="XXII" REF="34"/>
surface of this wonderful bank appeared in any way agitated, as I had suspicion that the pits might have been productive of whirlpools; but was informed, that the sea there exhibited no uncommon appearance.</P>
<P>The noted <HI>Doggers Bank</HI> next succeeds.<NOTE PLACE="marg">DOGGERS BANK.</NOTE> It commences at the distance of twelve leagues from <HI>Flamborough Head,</HI> and extends across the sea, nearly east, above seventy-two leagues, joining <HI>Horn-riff,</HI> a very narrow strip of sand which ends on the coast of <HI>Jutland.</HI> The greatest breadth is twenty leagues; and in parts it has only on it ten or eleven fathoms of water, in others twenty-four or five. To the south of the <HI>Dogger</HI> is a vast extent of sand-bank, named, in different parts, the <HI>Well Bank,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">WELL BANK.</NOTE> the <HI>Swart Bank,</HI> and the <HI>Brown Bank,</HI> all covered with sufficient depth of water; but between them and the <HI>British</HI> coasts are the <HI>Ower</HI> and the <HI>Lemon,</HI> dreaded by mariners, and numbers of others infamous for shipwrecks. The channel between the <HI>Dogger Bank</HI> and the <HI>Well Bank</HI> deepens even to forty fa∣thoms. This hollow is called the <HI>Silver Pits,</HI> and is noted for the cod-fishery which supplies the <HI>London</HI> markets. The cod-fish love the deeps: the flat-fish the shallows. I will not repeat what I have, in another place, so amply treated of<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See <HI>Br. Zool.</HI> iii. Articles Haddock, Ling, and Turbot.</NOTE>. I must only lament, that the fisheries of this bank are only subservient to the pur∣poses of luxury. Was (according to the plan of my humane friend, Mr. <HI>Travis</HI> of <HI>Scarborough)</HI> a canal formed from any part of the neighboring coast to that at <HI>Leeds,</HI> thousands of manufacturers would receive a cheap and wholesome food; insurrec∣tions in times of scarcity of grain be prevented; our manufactures worked at an easy rate; our rivals in trade thereby undersold; and, in defiance of the probably ap∣proaching decrease of the <HI>Newfoundland</HI> fishery (since the loss of <HI>America)</HI> contri∣bute to form a nursery of seamen sufficient to preserve the small remnant we have left of respect from foreign nations.</P>

<P>Between these and the main land, about two miles from the <HI>Cathness</HI> shore, lies <HI>Stroma,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">STROMA.</NOTE> the <HI>Ocetis</HI> of <HI>Ptolemy,</HI> a little island, an appertenance to that county, fertile by the manual labor of about thirty families; pleasant, and lofty enough for the resort of the Auk tribe. The noted mummies are now lost, occasioned by the doors of the caverns in which they were deposited being broken down, and admission given to cattle, which have trampled them to pieces. This catacomb stands on a neck of land bounded by the sea on three sides. The salt air and spray expels all insects, and is the only preservation the bodies have; some of which had been lodged here a great number of years. In many of the isles, the inhabitants use no other method for preserving their meat from putrefaction than hanging it in caves of the sea, and the method is vindicated by the success.</P>
<P>This island lies in the <HI>Pentland Firth,</HI> noted for the violence of the tides;<NOTE PLACE="marg">TIDES.</NOTE> tre∣mendous to the sight, but dangerous only when passed at improper times. They set in from the north-west: the flood, on the contrary, on the coasts of <HI>Lewis,</HI> pours in from the south<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mackensie's Charts of the Orknies, <HI>p. 4, 5.</HI></NOTE>. The tide of flood upon <HI>Stroma</HI> (and other islands similarly situated in mid-stream) divides or splits before it reaches it. A current runs with great violence on both sides, then unites, at some distance from the opposite end, and forms a single current, running at spring-tides at the rate of nine knots an hour; at neap, at that of three only. The space between the dividing tides, at different ends of an island, is quite stagnant, and is called the eddy. Some of them are a mile or two long, and give room for a ship to tack to and fro, till the tides are so far spent as to permit it to pursue its voyage.</P>
<P>The most boisterous parts of the streams are at the extremities of the island,<NOTE PLACE="marg">THE SWELCHIE OF STROMA.</NOTE> and a little beyond the top of the eddy, where they unite. The collision of these oppo∣site streams-excite a circular motion, and, when the tide is very strong, occasion whirlpools in form of an inverted bell, the largest diameter of which may be about three feet. In spring-tides they have force enough to turn a vessel round, but not to do any damage: but there have been instances of small boats being swallowed up. These whirlpools are largest when first formed; are carried away with the stream, and disappear, but are quickly followed by others. The spiral motion or suction
<PB N="XXIV" REF="36"/>
does not extend far beyond the cavity: a boat may pass within twenty yards of these whirlpools with safety. Fishermen who happen to find themselves within a dangerous distance, fling in an oar, or any bulky body, which breaks the con∣tinuity of the surface, and interrupts the vertiginous motion, and forces the water to rush suddenly in on all sides and fill up the cavity. In stormy weather, the waves themselves destroy this phaenomenon. A sunk rock near the concourse of these rapid tides occasions a most dreadful appearance. The stream meeting with an interruption, falls over with great violence, reaches the bottom, and brings up with it sand, shells, fishes, or whatsoever else it meets with; which, with boats, or whatsoever it happens to meet, is whirled from the centre of the eruption towards the circumference with amazing velocity, and the troubled surface boils and bubbles like a great cauldron, then darts off with a succession of whirlpools from successive ebullitions. These are called <HI>Rousts,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">ROUSTS.</NOTE> and are attended with the utmost danger to small boats, which are agitated to such a degree, that (even should they not be overset) the men are flung out of them, to perish without any chance of re∣demption. It is during the ebb that they are tremendous, and most so in that of a spring-tide with a west wind, and that in the calmest weather; for during flood they are passed with the greatest safety. Vessels in a calm are never in danger of touching on an island or visible rock, when they get into a current, but are always carried safe from all danger.</P>
<P><HI>Swona,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">SWONA.</NOTE> a little island, the most southern of the <HI>Orknies,</HI> is about four miles beyond <HI>Stroma,</HI> and is noted for its tremendous streams, and in particular the whirlpools called the <HI>Wells</HI> of <HI>Swona,</HI> which in a higher degree exhibit all the appearances of the former. What contributes to encrease the rage of the tides, besides their con∣finement between so many islands, is the irregular position of the sounds, and their little depth of water.<NOTE PLACE="marg">DEPTH OF WATER.</NOTE> The same shallowness extends to every side of the <HI>Orknies;</HI> an evidence that they had once been part of the mother isle, rent from it by some mighty convulsion. The middle of the channel, between <HI>Stroma</HI> and the main land, has only ten fathom water: the greatest depth around that island is only eighteen. The sounds are from three to forty-six fathom deep: the greater depths are between <HI>South Ronaldsha</HI> and <HI>South Wales;</HI> for in general the other sounds are only from three to thirteen; and the circumambient depth of the whole group very rarely exceeds twenty-five.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">TIDES.</NOTE>About these islands commences a decrease of the tides. They lie in a great ocean, in which the waters have room to expand; therefore never experience that height of flood which is constant in the contracted seas.

The <HI>English</HI> tongue, with a <HI>Norwegian</HI> accent, is that of the islands; but the appearance of the people, their manners and genius, evidently shew their northern origin. The islands vary in their form and height. Great part of <HI>Hoy</HI> is mountanous and lofty. The noted land-mark, the hill of <HI>Hoy,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">ROCKS OF THE ORKNIES.</NOTE> is said to be five hundred and forty yards high. The sides of all these hills are covered with long heath, in which breed multitudes of Curlews, Green Plovers, Redshanks, and other Waders. The Short-eared Owl is also very frequent here, and nestles in the ground. It is
<PB N="XXVI" REF="38"/>
probable that it is from hence, as well as from <HI>Norway,</HI> that it migrates, in the beginning of winter, to the more southern parts of <HI>Britain.</HI> Most of the Waders migrate; but they must receive considerable reinforcements from the most distant parts of the north, to fill the numbers which cover our shores. The cliffs are of a most stupendous height, and quite mural to the very sea. The <HI>Berry Head</HI> is an exalted precipice,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BIRDS.</NOTE> with an august cave at the bottom, opening into the sea. The Ern Eagles possess, by distant pairs, the upper part of the rocks: neither these nor any other Falcons will bear society; but, as <HI>Pliny</HI> elegantly expresses it, <HI>Adultos per∣sequitur parens et longè fugat, aemulos scilicet rapinae. Et alioquin unum par aquilarum magno ad populandum tractu, ut satietur, indiget</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hist. Nat. <HI>lib. x. c. 3.</HI></NOTE>. Auks, Corvorants, and all the tribes which love exalted situations, breed by thousands in the other parts. The Tyste, or Black Guillemot, N<SUP>o</SUP> 236, secures itself in a crack in the rock, or by scraping a burrow in the little earth it may find; there it lays a single egg, of a dirty olive blotched with a darker. This species never migrates from the <HI>Orknies.</HI> The Foolish Guillemot, N<SUP>o</SUP> 436, continues till <HI>November.</HI> The Little Auk, N<SUP>o</SUP> 429, a rare bird in other parts of <HI>Britain,</HI> breeds in the holes of the lofty precipices. And the Lyre, or the Sheerwater, N<SUP>o</SUP> 462, burrows in the earth among the rocks of <HI>Hoy</HI> and <HI>Eda,</HI> and forms an article of com∣merce with its feathers, and of food with its flesh, which is salted and kept for the provision of the winter. In that season they are seen skimming the ocean at most surprizing distances from land. The Stormy Petrel, N<SUP>o</SUP> 464, breeds fre∣quently among the loose stones; then takes to sea and affrights the superstitious sailor with its appearance. Woodcocks scarcely ever appear here. Fieldfares make this a short baiting-place: and the Snow Bunting, N<SUP>o</SUP> 122, often alights and covers whole tracts of country, driven by the frost from the farthest north.</P>
<P>A few Wild Swans breed in some lochs in <HI>Mainland;</HI> but the greatest part of these birds, all the Bernacles, Brent Geese, and several other palmated birds, retire in the spring to more northern latitudes. But to the Swallow-tailed Duck, the Pintail, and a few others, this is a warm climate; for they retire here to pass their winters in the sheltered bays. Any other remarks may be intermixed with those on <HI>Schetland;</HI> for there is great similiarity of subjects in both the groups.</P>
<P>The last lie about sixty miles to the north-east of the most northern <HI>Orkney.</HI> Mid∣way is <HI>Fair Island,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">FAIR ISLE.</NOTE> a spot about three miles long, with high and rocky shores, in∣habited by about a hundred and seventy people: an industrious race; the men fishers; the women knitters and spinners.

<P><PB N="XXVII" REF="40"/><HI>Schetland</HI> consists of several islands. <HI>Mainland,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">SCHETLAND.</NOTE> the principal, extends from south to north twenty-eight leagues, and is most singularly formed; consisting of an infinite number of <HI>peninsulae</HI> connected by very narrow isthmuses. That called <HI>Mavisgrind,</HI> which unites the parish of <HI>North Maven,</HI> is only eighty yards broad. But the irregular shape of this island occasions it to abound with the finest and most secure ports, called here <HI>voes;</HI> a most providential dispensation in a sea which swarms with fishes of the most general use. The adjacent islands are in general so near to the mother island, and their headlands point so exactly to its corresponding capes, that it is highly probable that they once made a part of the <HI>Mainland.</HI> The rocks and stacks assume great variety of forms, such as steeples and Gothic cathe∣drals rising out of the water, fleets of ships, and other fancied shapes. The <HI>Dore∣holm,</HI> in the parish of <HI>North Maven,</HI> is very singular: part is rounded, the rest seems a ruin, composed of a single thin fragment of rock, with a magnificent arch within, seventy feet in height.</P>
<P>To use the words of Captain <HI>Thomas Preston,</HI> to whom we are indebted for an excellent chart of this group, <Q>the land is wild, barren, and mountanous; nor is there so much as a bush or a tree to be seen. The shores are difficult, and in many parts inaccessible; rude, steep, and iron-like; the sight of which strikes the mind with dread and horror; and such monstrous precipices and hideous rocks as bring all <HI>Brobdingnag</HI> before your thoughts. These islands lie between lat. 60 to 61. In winter the sun sets soon after it rises, and in summer rises soon after it sets; so that in that season the nights are almost as light as the day; as on the contrary, in <HI>December</HI> the day is nearly as dark as the night. About the solstice, we see every night the <HI>aurora borealis,</HI> or, as they are called by the natives, the <HI>merry dancers,</HI> which spread a broad glaring appearance over the whole northern hemisphere<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Phil. Trans. abr. <HI>xi. 1328.</HI></NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>They are the constant attendants of the clear evenings in all these northern islands, and prove great reliefs amidst the gloom of the long winter nights.<NOTE PLACE="marg">AURORA BORE∣ALIS.</NOTE> They commonly appear at twilight near the horizon, of a dun color, approaching to yellow: sometimes continuing in that state for several hours without any sensible motion; after which they break out into streams of stronger light, spreading into columns, and altering slowly into ten thousand different shapes, varying their colors from all the tints of yellow to the obscurest russet. They often cover the whole hemisphere, and then make the most brilliant appearance. Their motions at these times are most amazingly quick; and they astonish the spectator with the rapid change of their form. They break out in places where none were seen before, skimming
<PB N="XXVIII" REF="41"/>
briskly along the heavens: are suddenly extinguished, and leave behind an uniform dusky tract. This again is brilliantly illuminated in the same manner, and as sud∣denly left a dull blank. In certain nights they assume the appearance of vast co∣lumns, on one side of the deepest yellow, on the other declining away till it becomes undistinguished from the sky. They have generally a strong tremulous motion from end to end, which continues till the whole vanishes. In a word, we, who only see the extremities of these northern phoenomena, have but a faint idea of their splendor, and their motions. According to the state of the atmosphere they differ in colors. They often put on the color of blood, and make a most dreadful ap∣pearance. The rustic sages become prophetic, and terrify the gazing spectators with the dread of war, pestilence, and famine. This superstition was not peculiar to the northern islands; nor are these appearances of recent date. The antients called them <HI>Chasmata,</HI> and <HI>Trabes,</HI> and <HI>Bolides,</HI> according to their forms or colors<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Aristol. Meteorolog. <HI>lib. i. c. 5.</HI> Plin. Nat. Hist. <HI>lib. ii. c. 26.</HI></NOTE>. In old times they were extremely rare, and on that account were the more taken notice of. From the days of <HI>Plutarch</HI> to those of our sage historian Sir <HI>Richard Baker,</HI> they were supposed to have been portentous of great events: and timid imagination shaped them into aerial conflicts.

After, I suppose, a very long intermission, they appeared with great brilliancy in <HI>England,</HI> on <HI>March</HI> 6rh, 1715-16. The philosophers paid a proper attention<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See various accounts of them in the <HI>Phil. Trans. abr.</HI> iv. part ii. 138.</NOTE>. The vulgar considered them as marking the introduction of a foreign race of princes. The novelty is now ceased, and their cause perhaps properly attributed to the greater abundance of electrical matter.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">STORMS.</NOTE>The tempests which reign over these islands during winter is astonishing. The cold is moderate; the fogs great and frequent; but the storms agitate the water even to the bottom of these comparatively shallow seas.<NOTE PLACE="marg">HERRINGS.</NOTE> The fish seek the bottom of the great deeps: and the Herrings, which appear off the <HI>Schetlands</HI> in amazing columns in <HI>June,</HI> perform the circuit of our island, and retire beyond the know∣lege of man. When the main body of these fish approaches from the north, it alters the very appearance of the ocean. It is divided into columns of five or six miles in length, and three or four in breadth, and they drive the water before them with a sort of rippling current. Sometimes they sink for a small space, then rise again; and in bright weather reflect a variety of splendid colors, like a field of most

precious gems. Birds and fish of prey attend and mark their progress. The Whales of several kinds keep on the outside, and, deliberately opening their vast mouths, take them in by hundreds. Gannets and Gulls dart down upon them; and the diving tribe aid their persecution, with the cetaceous fishes<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See my <HI>Voy. to the Hebrides,</HI> and <HI>Br.

The poor vassals (in defiance of laws still kept in bondage) are compelled to slave, and hazard their lives in the capture, to deliver their fish to their lords for a trifling sum, who sell them to adventurers from different parts at a high price.</P>
<P>Among other scarcer fishes the Opah,<NOTE PLACE="marg">OPAH.</NOTE> <HI>Br. Zool.</HI> iii. N<SUP>o</SUP> 101. is found in abundance. It seems a fish of the north as well as the <HI>Torsk;</HI> the last is not found south of the <HI>Orknies;</HI> the former extends even to the banks of <HI>Newfoundland.</HI></P>
<P>The birds of these islands are the same with those of the <HI>Orknies,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">BIRDS.</NOTE> except the Skua, p. 531, which breeds only in <HI>Foula</HI> and <HI>Unst.</HI> Among the few land-birds which migrate to them in summer, is the Golden-crested Wren, N<SUP>o</SUP> 153. Its shortest flight must be sixty miles, except it should rest midway on <HI>Fair island;</HI> a surprising flight for so diminutive a bird!</P>
<P>Multitudes of the inhabitants of each cluster of islands feed, during the season,<NOTE PLACE="marg">FOWLING.</NOTE> on the eggs of the birds of the cliffs. The method of taking them is so very hazardous, as to satisfy one of the extremity to which the poor people are driven for want of food. <HI>Copinsha, Hunda, Hoy, Foula,</HI> and <HI>Noss head,</HI> are the most celebrated rocks; and the neighboring natives the most expert climbers and adventurers after the game of the precipice. The height of some is above fifty fathoms; their faces roughened with shelves or ledges, sufficient only for the birds to rest and lay their eggs. To these the dauntless fowlers will ascend, pass in∣trepidly from one to the other, collect the eggs and birds, and descend with the same indifference. In most places, the attempt is made from above: they are lowered from the slope contiguous to the brink, by a rope, sometimes made of straw, sometimes of the bristles of the hog: they prefer the last, even to ropes of hemp, as it is not liable to be cut by the sharpness of the rocks; the former is apt to untwist. They trust themselves to a single assistant, who lets his companion down, and holds the rope, depending on his strength alone; which
<PB N="XXX" REF="43"/>
often fails, and the adventurer is sure to be dashed to pieces, or drowned in the subjacent sea. The rope is often shifted from place to place, with the impend∣ing weight of the fowler and his booty. The person above receives signals for the purpose, his associate being far out of sight; who, during the operation, by help of a staff, springs from the face of the rocks, to avoid injury from the pro∣jecting parts.</P>
<P>In <HI>Foula,</HI> they will trust to a small stake driven into the ground, or to a small dagger, which the natives usually carry about them; and which they will stick into the ground, and, twisting round it a fishing cord, descend by that to climbing places, and, after finishing their business, swarm up by it without fear. Few who make a practice of this come to a natural death. They have a common saying, <Q>Such a one's <HI>Gutcher</HI> went over the <HI>Sneak;</HI> and my father went over the <HI>Sneak</HI> too.</Q> It is a pity that the old <HI>Norwegian</HI> law was not here in force. It considered this kind of death as a species of suicide. The next of kin (in case the body could be seen) was directed to go the same way; if he refused, the corpse was not to be admitted into holy ground<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Debes, Hist. Ferroe Isles, <HI>154.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>But the most singular species of fowling is on the holm of <HI>Noss,</HI> a vast rock severed from the isle of <HI>Noss</HI> by some unknown convulsion, and only about sixteen fathoms distant. It is of the same stupendous height as the opposite precipice<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">480 feet.</NOTE>, with a raging sea between; so that the intervening chasm is of matchless horror. Some adventurous climber has reached the rock in a boat, gained the height, and fastened several stakes on the small portion of earth which is to be found on the top: correspondent stakes are placed on the edge of the correspondent cliffs. A rope is fixed to the stakes on both sides, along which a machine, called a cradle, is contrived to slide; and, by the help of a small parallel cord fastened in like manner, the adventurer wafts himself over, and returns with his booty, which is the eggs or young of the Black-backed Gull, N<SUP>o</SUP> 451, and the Herring Gull, N<SUP>o</SUP> 452.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">QUADRUPEDS.</NOTE>The number of wild Quadrupeds which have reached the <HI>Orkney</HI> and <HI>Schet∣land</HI> islands are only five; the Otter, Brown Rat, Common Mouse, Fetid Shrew, and Bat. Rabbets are not of <HI>British</HI> origin, but naturalized in every part. In the sandy isles of <HI>Orkney,</HI> they are found in myriads, and their skins are a great article of commerce; but the injury they do in setting the unstable soil in motion, greatly counter-vales the profit.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">THESE ISLES ONCE WOODED.</NOTE>In many parts of these islands are evident marks of their having been a wooded country.

blown away the incumbent strata of sand or gravel with which they have been covered. They are lodged in a morassy ground, and often ten feet beneath the peat. Some stand in the position in which they grew; others lie horizontally, and all the same way, as if they had either been blown down, or overturned by a partial deluge. Yet at present no kind of wood can be made to grow; and even the lowest and most common shrub is cultivated with the greatest difficulty. The hazel, the herbaceous, reticulated, creeping, and common willow, are the only shrubs of the island, and those are scattered with a sparing hand. I shall, in an∣other place, consider the decrease of vegetation in this northern progress.</P>
<P>The great quantity of turf which Providence hath bestowed on all these islands, excepting <HI>Sanda,</HI> is another proof of the abundance of trees and other vegetables, long since lost from the surface. The application of this <HI>humus vegetabilis</HI> for the purpose of fuel, is said to have been first taught the natives by <HI>Einar,</HI> a <HI>Nor∣wegian,</HI> surnamed, from that circumstance, <HI>Torf einar, Einar de Cespite</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Torfaeus Rer.

Along the <HI>Orkney</HI> and <HI>Schetland</HI> shores, they almost form a chain; and by that means not only kept the natives in subjection, but were situated commodiously for covering the landing of their countrymen, who were perpetually roving on piratical expeditions. These towers were even made use of as state-prisons; for we learn from <HI>Torfaeus,</HI> that after <HI>Sueno</HI> had surprized <HI>Paul,</HI> count of <HI>Cathness,</HI> he carried him into <HI>Sutherland,</HI> and confined him there in a <HI>Norwegian</HI> tower<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Baxter, Gloss.

So much has been said on this subject by the Reverend Mr. <HI>Cordiner</HI> and myself, that I shall only refer to the pages, after saying, that out of our kingdom, no buildings similar to these are to be found, except in <HI>Scandinavia.</HI> On the mountain <HI>Swalberg</HI> <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Information by letter from Mr. <HI>Suhm</HI> of <HI>Copenhagen.</HI></NOTE> in <HI>Norway</HI> is one; the <HI>Stir-biskop</HI><NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Dalhberg, <HI>tab. 64.</HI></NOTE>, at <HI>Upsal</HI> in <HI>Sweden,</HI> is another; and <HI>Umseborg,</HI> in the same kingdom, is a third<NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">The same, tab. 300.—For more ample accounts, see Mr. <HI>Cordiner</HI>'s <HI>Letters,</HI> 73, 105, 118, and my <HI>Tours in Scotland.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>These towers vary in their inner structure; but externally are universally the same; yet some have an addition of strength on the outside. The burgh of <HI>Culs∣wick</HI> in <HI>Schetland,</HI> notwithstanding it is built on the top of a hill, is surrounded with a dry ditch thirteen feet broad; that of <HI>Snaburgh</HI> in <HI>Unst,</HI> has both a wet and a dry ditch; the first cut, with great labor, through the live rock. The burgh of <HI>Moura</HI> is surrounded by a wall, now reduced to a heap of stones, and the inside is cylindrical, not taper, as usual with others. The burgh of <HI>Hogscter,</HI> upon an isle in a loch of the same name, has also its addition of a wall; a pecu∣liarity in a causeway, to join it to the main land, and a singular internal structure. Numbers of little burghs, with single cells, are scattered about these islands, in the neighborhood of the greater; and which probably were built by the poorer sort of people, in order to enjoy their protection. A multitude of places in these islands have the addition of <HI>burgh</HI> to their names, notwithstanding there is not a vestige of a tower near them; the materials having long since been carried away, and applied to various uses. One was, by way of pre-eminence, called <HI>Conings∣burgh,</HI> or the <HI>burgh of the king.</HI> I lament its loss the more, as it might have proved similar to its namesake in <HI>Yorkshire,</HI> and furnished additional materials to

my worthy friend, <HI>Edward King,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> for his most elaborate history of <HI>English</HI> castles<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See his curious account of <HI>Coningsborough</HI> castle, which he justly compares to the <HI>Scottish Duns;</HI> and judiciously ascribes to it a very early date. <HI>Archaeologia,</HI> vi. 234. tab. xxiii.</NOTE>. The plates, with explanatory accounts, shall supply what farther can elucidate these curious antiquities.</P>
<P>After the expulsion of the <HI>Norwegians,</HI> the coasts of <HI>Scotland,</HI> which they possessed, were still protected by castles; many of which, such as <HI>Oldwick,</HI> ex∣hibit very small improvements on the model left by the antient <HI>Scandinavian</HI> architects: a few deviated from the original manner, were square, had great thick∣ness of wall, furnished with cells like those in the round towers or <HI>burghs. Borve</HI> castle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BORVE CASTLE.</NOTE> in <HI>Cathness,</HI> is a little more advanced. This was the residence of <HI>Thorkel,</HI> a famous freebooter in the tenth century. It is a small square building, on a rock projecting into the sea, adjoined to the main land by an isthmus not ten feet wide; and beneath the castle is a magnificent passage for boats, which pierces the rock from side to side, and is covered by a matchless natural arch.</P>
<P>I cannot but revert to the former subject, to mention the <HI>Snaburgh</HI> in <HI>Tet∣lor,</HI> one of the most remote of the <HI>Schetland</HI> isles. It is in the form of a <HI>Roman</HI> camp;<NOTE PLACE="marg">ROMAN CAMP:</NOTE> and when entire, had in the middle a rectangular area surrounded by a wall, and that by an earthen rampart of the same figure, at some distance from it. Two sides of the walled area have the additional defence of another rampart of earth; which commences on the inside of one of the narrower sides, and, preserving the same distance from the lesser area as the two other sides of the outward fence do, terminates at the latter, near an artificial well. That this was <HI>Roman,</HI> I greatly suspect. The care for water was a peculiar object with that wise nation; but neglected by barbarians. This is inclosed within the rampart, and at a small distance on the outside, had the protection of a mount, which once probably had its castellet, garrisoned for the further security<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Vegetius de re Milit. <HI>lib. iv. c. 10.</HI></NOTE>. The regular <HI>portae</HI> are wanting; in other respects it resembles a <HI>Roman</HI> camp. The sea, over which it impends, has destroyed one half: the entire part is given in the plate, and the rest supplied with dotted lines.</P>
<P>I know but of two periods in which the <HI>Romans</HI> visited these islands: one at the time when the fleet of <HI>Agricola</HI> subdued them; the other, when the fleet of <HI>Honorius</HI> defeated the <HI>Saxons</HI> in the seas of <HI>Orkney.</HI> A copper medal of <HI>Ves∣pasian,</HI> with <HI>Judaea devicta</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mr.</HI> Low.</NOTE> on the reverse, was found on the south side of <HI>Main-land,</HI> probably lost there by the first invaders, who might venerate <HI>Vespasian,</HI> under whom many of them had served, and who might naturally carry with them such honorable memorials of his reign. The only antiquities found near
<PB N="XXXIV" REF="49"/>
this place, were six pieces of brass, cast into a form the nearest resembling fet∣ters. They were wrapped in a piece of raw hide; but we cannot pretend to say that they belonged to the occupiers of the camp.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">STONE WEAPONS.</NOTE>Flint heads of arrows, flint axes, swords made of the bones of a whale, stones, beads, and antiquities, must be referred to the earliest inhabitants, at a period in which these kingdoms were on a level with the natives of new-discovered islands in the <HI>South Sea.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">CIRCLES.</NOTE> Druidical circles of stones, the temples of primaeval religion of our island, are not uncommon. The finest and most entire are those at <HI>Stennis,</HI> in one of the <HI>Orkney</HI> isles. The diameter of the circle is about a hundred and ten yards. The highest stone fourteen feet. The whole is singularly surrounded with a broad and deep ditch, probably to keep at a distance the unhallowed vulgar.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">SEMICIRCLES.</NOTE>At the same place is a noble semicircle, consisting of four vast stones entire, and one broken. The highest are twenty feet high above ground. Behind them is a mound of earth, conformable to their position. If there never was a num∣ber of stones to complete a circle, this antiquity was one of the kind which the learned Doctor <HI>Borlase</HI> calls a theatre, and supposes was designed for the exhi∣bition of dramatical performances<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Antiq. Cornwall, <HI>195.</HI></NOTE>. I suspect them to have been either for the purposes of religion, or judicial transactions; for the age was probably not suf∣ficiently refined for the former amusements. Upright stones, either memorials of the dead,<NOTE PLACE="marg">PLAIN COLUMNS.</NOTE> or victories obtained on the spot, are very numerous. The most re∣markable is the stone of <HI>Sator,</HI> in the isle of <HI>Eda.</HI> It is a flag, fifteen feet high, five and a half broad, and only nine inches thick. Its story is quite unknown; but it probably rests over a hero of that name. Notwithstanding the long resi∣dence of the <HI>Norwegians</HI> in these islands, I find only one stone with a <HI>Runic</HI> in∣scription, which runs along the sides. The rest of the stone is plain, and desti∣tute of the sculptures so frequent on those found in <HI>Scandinavia.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">SCULPTURED CO∣LUMNS.</NOTE>In the wall of the church at <HI>Sandness,</HI> is a stone with three circles, a semi∣circle, and a square figure, engraven on it. This is the only one which bears any resemblance to the elegant carved columns at <HI>Meigle</HI> and <HI>Glames,</HI> and which extend, after a very long interval, as far as the church-yard of <HI>Far,</HI> on the ex∣treme northern coast of <HI>Cathness.</HI> Several of these have been before attended to. I can only remark, that they are extremely local, and were, by their similarity, only the work of a short period. We imagine that the first, about which we can form any conjecture, was erected in 994, on the defeat of <HI>Camus,</HI> the <HI>Dane:</HI> the last in 1034, on the murder of <HI>Malcolm</HI> the Second.</P>
<P><PB N="XXXV" REF="50"/>In the isle of <HI>Unst</HI> are two singular circles, near each other.<NOTE PLACE="marg">SEPULCHRAL ANTIQUITIES.</NOTE> The largest is fifty feet in diameter, to the outmost ring; for it consists of three, concentrical; the outmost is formed of small stones, the two inner of earth; through all of which is a single narrow entrance to a tumulus which rises in the centre. The other circle is only twenty-two feet in diameter, and has only two rings, formed of earth:<NOTE PLACE="marg">CIRCULAR.</NOTE> in the centre is a barrow, the sides of which are fenced with stones. No marks of their having been places of interment have been found, yet most probably that was their use.</P>
<P>The links or sands of <HI>Skail,</HI> in <HI>Sandwich,</HI> one of the <HI>Orknies,</HI> abound in round <HI>barrows.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">BARROWS.</NOTE> Some are formed of earth alone, others of stone covered with earth. In the former was found a coffin, made of six flat stones. They are too short to receive a body at full length: the skeletons found in them lie with the knees pressed to the breast, and the legs doubled along the thighs. A bag, made of rushes, has been found at the feet of some of these skeletons, containing the bones, most probably, of another of the family. In one were to be seen multitudes of small beetles. Whether they were placed there by design, or lodged there by acci∣dent, I will not determine; but, as I have discovered similar insects in the bag which inclosed the sacred <HI>Ibis,</HI> we may suppose that the <HI>Egyptians,</HI> and the nation to whom these <HI>tumuli</HI> did belong, might have had the same superstition respecting them. On some of the corpses interred in this island, the mode of burning was observed. The ashes, deposited in an urn which was covered on the top with a flat stone, have been found in the cell of one of the barrows. This coffin or cell was placed on the ground, then covered with a heap of stones, and that again cased with earth and sods. Both barrow and contents evince them to be of a dif∣ferent age from the former. These tumuli were in the nature of family vaults: in them have been found two tiers of coffins<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Mr. <HI>Low</HI>'s account, and plate, <HI>Archaeologia,</HI> iii. 276. tab. xiii.</NOTE>. It is probable, that on the death of any one of the family, the tumulus was opened, and the body interred near its kindred bones.</P>
<P>The violence of the winds have,<NOTE PLACE="marg">GRAVES OF WESTRA.</NOTE> by blowing away the sands in a certain part of <HI>Westra,</HI> one of the <HI>Schetlands,</HI> discovered an extensive burying-place, once covered with the thickness of twenty feet. This seems to have belonged to different na∣tions. One is marked by the <HI>tumuli</HI> consisting of stones and rubbish; some rounded, others flat at top like truncated cones. Near them are multitudes of graves, which are discoverable only by one, two, three, four, and sometimes even more short upright stones, set in the level sand. The corpse was interred a few feet deep, and covered with a layer of fine clay, to keep the sand from touching it.
<PB N="XXXVI" REF="51"/>
Not only human bones, but those of oxen, horses, dogs, and sheep, have been found in these graves. Besides, were several sorts of warlike instruments, battle-axes, two-handed swords, broad swords, brazen daggers and scull-caps, and swords made of the bones of the whale: knives and combs: beads, brotches, and chains of ornament: a metal spoon, and a neat glass cup greatly corroded: small flat cir∣cular pieces of marble: stones shaped like whetstones, and spherical stones per∣forated, such as were in former use in <HI>Scotland</HI> for turning of spindles: but the most singular thing was a thigh-bone closely incircled by a ring of gold. The tumuli seem to have been the places of sepulture of the inhabitants of the isles: the graves, those of some foreign nation who had landed here, had a conflict, and prov∣ed victorious. I found my conjecture on the arms and other matters found in them. The brass were <HI>Norwegian</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Wormii Mon. Dan. <HI>50.</HI> Dalhberg Suecia Antiqua, et Hodierna, <HI>tab. 314.</HI></NOTE>, the iron belonging to the natives; but the weapons of conquerors and conquered were, with ceremonies resembling those at the funeral of <HI>Pallas,</HI> flung into the graves of the victorious party.</P>

<P>The antiquities of this class found in <HI>Scandinavia</HI> are very numerous,<NOTE PLACE="marg">IN SCANDINAVIA.</NOTE> and of a magnitude which evince the extreme population of the country. I discover only three kinds. The first may be exemplified in the vast rounded earthen tumulus in <HI>Smaland,</HI> with a rude monumental upright stone at top; and near it a spherical stone, beautifully carved, flung up in honor of <HI>Ingo</HI> King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> in the latter end of the ninth century<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Dahlberg Suecia Antiqua, <HI>tab. 322.</HI></NOTE>: others in honor of <HI>Humblus,</HI> and <HI>Laudur</HI> brother to King <HI>Angantyr;</HI> the last surrounded at its base with a circle of rude stones<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">The same, 315.</NOTE>. The <HI>Rambora Rolle</HI> is a mount of earth, with three upright pillars, placed so as to form a triangular space<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">The same, 323.</NOTE>. Other <HI>tumuli</HI> consist entirely of vast heaps of stones. Several of the sepulchral memorials are formed of stones disposed in a circular form: some of low stones, like that of the <HI>Danish</HI> King <HI>Harald Hyldeland,</HI> placed round the edge of the flat area of a low mount. He was slain in battle by <HI>Ringo</HI> King of <HI>Sweden</HI><NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Saxo Gramm. <HI>147.</HI></NOTE>, who paid him all funeral honors, burnt his body with great pomp, and placed around his tumulus the numerous bodies of his faithful fol∣lowers who were slain around their prince; and their places of rest are marked by multitudes of small earthen barrows, with a single stone at the top of each. On
<PB N="XXXVII" REF="52"/>
the regal mount is a flat stone, with five hollows in it, basons to receive the blood of the victims<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dahlberg,</HI> tab. 315.</NOTE>. Others consist of small stones with <HI>Maen-hirion,</HI> as the <HI>Welsh</HI> style them, lofty rude pillars, intermixed. In some the lesser stones depart from the circu∣lar form, are oval or oblong: their edges are often contiguous, and those parts are often marked with a lofty pillar<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The same, and tab. 281.</NOTE>. Two pillars are sometimes found, with an enor∣mous stone set from top to top, so as to form the resemblance of a gateway<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Olaus Magnus.</NOTE>. Co∣lumns of great height are also found, surrounded at their base with two circles of small stones<NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Wormii Mon. Dan. <HI>p. 63.</HI></NOTE>. Finally, the stones are disposed so as to form wedges, squares, long rows, as well as circles. The first denoted that armies of foot and horse had prevaled: the second, troops of warriors: the third, duels of champions: and the last, the burials of families<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">I do not well understand some of these distinctions; but give them from <HI>Olaus Magnus,</HI> lib. i. c. 18.

Multitudes of single obeliscs are scattered over the country: some quite plain; others inscribed with <HI>Runic</HI> characters, memorial of the dead, intermixed with well-fancied ornaments<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Wormii Monum. Dan. <HI>64, &amp; passim.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>In many of the <HI>tumuli</HI> are found the weapons and other matters which had been deposited with the burnt bones of the deceased. In those of the earliest ages are the stone weapons, such as axes and spears heads made of flint. In others have been met with a small lamp, a key, and swords of brass of the same form with some of the <HI>Roman</HI> swords<NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dahlberg,</HI> tab. 314.</NOTE>. A superstition attending the swords was singular: those of highest temper were supposed to have been made by <HI>Duergi, dwarfs</HI> or fairies, and were thought to have been irresistible.

<P>The next step is to the FEROE islands,<NOTE PLACE="marg">FEROE ISLES.</NOTE> a group about two hundred and ten miles to the north-west of the northern <HI>Schetland,</HI> between lat. 61, 15. and 62, 30. There are seventeen which are habitable, each of which is a lofty mountain arising out of the waves, divided from the others by deep and rapid currents. Some of them are deeply indented with secure harbours; providence seeming to have favored mankind with the safest retreats in the most boisterous seas. All are very steep, and most of
<PB N="XL" REF="55"/>
them faced with most tremendous precipices. The surface of the mountains con∣sists of a shallow soil of remarkable fertility; for barley, the only corn sown here, yields above twenty for one; and the grass affords abundant pasturage for sheep. The exports are salted mutton and tallow, goose quils, feathers, and Eider down; and, by the industry of the inhabitants, knit woollen waistcoats, caps, and stock∣ings. No trees beyond the size of juniper, or stunted willows, will grow here: nor are any wild quadrupeds to be met with, except rats and mice, originally escaped from the shipping.</P>
<P>The list of land birds is very small:<NOTE PLACE="marg">LAND BIRDS.</NOTE>—The Cinereous Eagle, p. 214. B; the Lanner, p. 225. K; the Sparrow Hawk, p. 226. N<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">These on the authority of Mr. <HI>Debes,</HI> who wrote the history of these isles in 1670.</NOTE>; a species of Owl; the Raven, N<SUP>o</SUP> 134; and Hooded Crow, p. 251. B. are the pernicious species. Ravens were so destructive to the Lambs and Sheep, that in old times every boat∣man was obliged to bring into the sessions-house, on <HI>St. Olaus</HI>'s day, the beak of one of those birds, or pay one skin, which was called the <HI>Raven-fine,</HI> in case of neglect. The remaining land fowl are Wild Pigeons and Stares, White Wagtails, Wrens, and sometimes the Swallow. The Snow Bunting only rests here in spring, on its passage northward. The Heron is sometimes met with. The Spoon-Bill is Common<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Brunnich, <HI>p. 46.</HI></NOTE>. The Sea Pie, Water Rail, and Lapwing, are seen here. The birds of the rocks, such as Puffins, Razor Bills, and Little Auks, Foolish and Black Guillemots, swarm here; and the <HI>Geyir-fugl,</HI> or Great Auk, at certain periods visits these islands. The last, by reason of its short wing incapable of flight, nestles at the foot of the cliffs. The Skua, Arctic, Black-backed, and Herring Gulls, Fulmars, Manks, Stormy Petrels, Imber and Northern Divers, Wild Swans and Geese, (the Swans only vernal passengers towards the north) Eider Ducks, Havelda or Long-tailed Ducks, Corvorants, and the Sula Gannet, form the sum of the palmated fowl of these inhospitable spots.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">FOWLING.</NOTE>The manner of fowling is so very strange and hazardous that the description should by no means be omitted. Necessity compels mankind to wonderful attempts. The cliffs which contain the objects of their search are often two hundred fathoms in height,<NOTE PLACE="marg">FROM ABOVE.</NOTE> and are attempted from above and below. In the first case, the fowlers provide themselves with a rope eighty or a hundred fathoms in length. The fowler fastens one end about his waist and between his legs, recommends himself to the protection of the Almighty, and is lowered down by six others, who place a piece of timber on the margin of the rock, to preserve the rope from wearing against the sharp edge. They have besides a small line fastened to the body of the ad∣venturer, by which he gives signals that they may lower or raise him, or shift him
<PB N="XLI" REF="56"/>
from place to place. The last operation is attended with great danger, by the loosening of the stones, which often fall on his head, and would infallibly destroy him, was it not protected by a strong thick cap; but even that is found unequal to save him against the weight of the larger fragments of rock. The dexterity of the fowlers is amazing; they will place their feet against the front of the preci∣pice, and dart themselves some fathoms from it, with a cool eye survey the places where the birds nestle, and again shoot into their haunts. In some places the birds lodge in deep recesses. The fowler will alight there, disengage himself from the rope, fix it to a stone, and at his leisure collect the booty, fasten it to his girdle, and resume his pendulous seat. At times he will again spring from the rock, and in that attitude, with a fowling net placed at the end of a staff, catch the old birds which are flying to and from their retreats. When he hath finished his dreadful employ, he gives a signal to his friends above, who pull him up, and share the hard-earned profit. The feathers are preserved for exportation: the flesh is partly eaten fresh: but the greater portion dried for winter's provision.</P>
<P>The fowling from below has its share of danger.<NOTE PLACE="marg">FROM BELOW.</NOTE> The party goes on the expe∣dition in a boat; and when it has attained the base of the precipice, one of the most daring, having fastened a rope about his waist, and furnished himself with a long pole with an iron hook at one end, either climbs, or is thrust up by his companions, who place a pole under his breech, to the next footing spot he can reach<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In <HI>Pontoppidan's Hist. Norway,</HI> ii. 61. is a plate expressive of this manner of fowling.</NOTE>. He, by means of the rope, brings up one of the boats crew; the rest are drawn up in the same manner, and each is furnished with his rope and fowling-staff. They then continue their progress upwards in the same manner, till they arrive at the region of birds; and wander about the face of the cliff in search of them. They then act in pairs; one fastens himself to the end of his associate's rope, and, in places where birds have nestled beneath his footing, he permits himself to be lowered down, depending for his security to the strength of his companion, who is to haul him up again; but it sometimes happens that the person above is overpowered by the weight, and both inevitably perish. They fling the fowl down to the boat, which attends their motions, and receives the booty. They often pass seven or eight days in this tremendous employ, and lodge in the crannies which they find in the face of the precipice.</P>
<P>The sea which surrounds these islands is extremely turbulent. The tides vary greatly on the western and eastern sides. On the first, where is received the un∣interrupted flood of the ocean from the remote <HI>Greenland,</HI> the tide rises seven fa∣thoms: on the eastern side it rises only three. Dreadful whirlwinds, called by the <HI>Danes, oes,</HI> agitate the sea to a strange degree; catch up a vast quantity of water,
<PB N="XLII" REF="57"/>
so as to leave a great temporary chasm in the spot on which it falls, and carries away with it, to an amazing distance, any fishes which may happen to be within reach of its fury. Thus great shoals of Herrings have been found on the highest moun∣tains of <HI>Feroe.</HI> It is equally resistless on land, tearing up trees, stones, and animals, and carrying them to very distant places. We must no longer laugh at the good archbishop<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Olaus Magnus, <HI>Archb. of</HI> Upsal.</NOTE>, who gravely tells us, that at times, the Rats called <HI>Lemming</HI> are poured down from the clouds in great showers on the <HI>Alps</HI> of <HI>Norway.</HI> We assent to the fact; but must solve the phoenomenon by ascribing it to a whirlwind, as he does in one place; yet immediately supposes they may be bred in the upper regions <HI>out of feculent</HI> matter.</P>
<P>Among the numerous whirlpools of these seas, that of <HI>Suderoe,</HI> near the island of the same name, is the most noted. It is occasioned by a crater, sixty-one fathoms in depth in the centre, and from fifty to fifty-five on the sides. The water forms four fierce circumgirations. The point they begin at is on the side of a large bason, where commences a range of rocks running spirally, and terminating at the verge of the crater. This range is extremely rugged, and covered with water from the depth of twelve to eight fathoms only. It forms four equidistant wreaths, with a channel from thirty-five to twenty fathoms in depth between each. On the outside, beyond that depth, the sea suddenly sinks to eighty and ninety. On the south border of the bason is a lofty rock, called <HI>Sumboe Munk,</HI> noted for the multitude of birds which frequent it. On one side, the water is only three or four fathoms deep; on the other fifteen. The danger at most times, especially in storms, is very great. Ships are irresistibly drawn in: the rudder loses its power, and the waves beat as high as the masts; so that an escape is almost miraculous: yet at the reflux, and in very still weather, the inhabitants will venture in boats, for the sake of fishing. Mr. <HI>Debes</HI> omits the times of greatest danger. It is to be hoped that attention will be paid to the various periodical appearances of a phoenomenon, the cause of which is very satisfactorily explained by the worthy pastor<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See his plan, p. 52.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Mankind found their way to these islands some time before the discovery of <HI>Iceland. Naddodd,</HI> a <HI>Norwegian</HI> pirate, had retired here, as the only place of security he could find<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Islands</HI> Landnamabok, <HI>5.</HI></NOTE>. About this time, <HI>Harold Harfagre</HI> possessed himself of <HI>Norway,</HI> and flung off the <HI>Danish</HI> yoke. A party was formed against him; but it was soon subdued, and the malecontents quitting the kingdom, retired to the <HI>Hebrides, Orknies, Schetland,</HI> and <HI>Feroe,</HI> and gave rise to the <HI>Norwegian</HI> reign in all those islands.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">ICELAND.</NOTE>From the <HI>Feroe</HI> islands, the hardy <HI>Scandinavians</HI> made the next step, in their nor∣thern migrations, to ICELAND. I must premise, that there is the highest pro∣bability that this island was discovered in an age most remote to theirs: and that it was the <HI>Thule</HI> of <HI>Pytheas,</HI> an illustrious <HI>Marseillian,</HI> at lest cotemporary with
<PB N="XLIII" REF="58"/>
<HI>Aristotle</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The works of <HI>Pytheas</HI> had been read by <HI>Dicaearchus,</HI> a disciple of <HI>Aristotle</HI>'s. See <HI>Strabo,</HI> lib. ii. p. 163.</NOTE>, and who pushed his discoveries towards the north, as his countryman <HI>Euthymenes</HI> did beyond the line. <HI>Pytheas</HI> arrived at <HI>Thule,</HI> an island, says he, six days sailing northward from <HI>Britain,</HI> where, he informs us, was continual day and night for six months alternately<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Plin.</HI> lib. ii. c. 75.</NOTE>. He does not exactly hit on the length of day and night; but he could have been at no other, at that distance from <HI>Britain,</HI> but <HI>Iceland,</HI> in which there was a most remarkable absence of light. As to <HI>Naddodd,</HI> in 861, he was accidentally driven by a tempest to the eastern side of <HI>Iceland,</HI> to a place now called <HI>Reidarfiall.</HI> He found the country covered with snow, and therefore named it <HI>Snoeland;</HI> yet he returned home full of its praises. Soon after, <HI>Gardar,</HI> a <HI>Swede,</HI> experienced the same fortune. On a voyage to the <HI>Hebrides,</HI> he was tempest-driven to the same island; on which, by the advice of his mother, who was a sort of diviner, he landed at <HI>Horn.</HI> At this period <HI>Iceland</HI> was cloathed with wood from the shore to the very tops of the mountains. He wintered there, and likewise returned full of its praises<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Same, p. 7.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>FLOKE, a celebrated pirate, was the next adventurer. He took with him three Ravens, and, like another <HI>Noah,</HI> made them the augury of the land. Before he sailed, he performed a great sacrifice for the success, upon a vast pile of stones, which he raised for the purpose. This points out another origin of the vast tumuli we so frequently see. He made the <HI>Schetland</HI> and the <HI>Feroe</HI> isles his first steps; and loosed from the last for <HI>Iceland,</HI> the nearest point of which is about five hundred and forty miles distant. His first Raven returned to <HI>Feroe:</HI> the second flew back to the ship: the third directed him to the wished-for land<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot"><HI>Same, p. 8.</HI> Torfoeus. Hist. Norveg. <HI>ii. 97.</HI></NOTE>. He wintered there. The cattle he brought with him perished through want. The spring proved unusually cold, and the sea appeared full of ice; for which reason he bestowed on the island the name it at present bears. <HI>Floke</HI> was sick of his voyage: returned full of dispraises of the country. This did not discourage other adventurers, all of them <HI>Scandi∣navians,</HI> thrust out of the exuberant northern hive. The rest of the world, which their countrymen ravaged, was assuredly too small for them, otherwise they never would have colonized almost the most wretched spot in the northern hemisphere. Ambition possibly actuated the leaders, who might think it
<Q>Better to reign in hell than serve in heaven.</Q>
Colony after colony arrived. They confederated, and formed a republic, which existed near four hundred years; but with as many feuds and slaughters as could
<PB N="XLIV" REF="59"/>
happen in a climate where luxury might pamper and corrupt the inhabitants. In 1261, wearied with their dissensions, they voluntarily re-united themselves to their mother-country, <HI>Norway,</HI> under the reign of its monarch <HI>Haquin.</HI> It is re∣markable, that the poetic genius of their aboriginal country flourished with equal sublimity in every climate. The <HI>Scalds,</HI> or bards, retained their fire in the inhos∣pitable climate of <HI>Iceland,</HI> as vigorously as when they attended on their chieftains to the mild air of <HI>Spain,</HI> or <HI>Sicily,</HI> and sung their valiant deeds.</P>
<P>Every thing which furnished topics to the poets of other countries, was, in the most remote period, wanting here. Groves, verdant meadows, purling streams, and gentle zephyrs, were totally unknown; and in their stead, stunted shrubs, a thin herbage, rude torrents, and fierce gales, reign in every part. We admit the apology of the learned <HI>Torfoeus</HI> for the present state of his country<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hist. Norweg. <HI>i. 12.</HI></NOTE>. Violent tempests might cover whole tracts with the unstable sand, eruptions of water from the mountains desolate some parts, earthquakes bury vast extents of fertile land with fragments of rocks, and inundations of the sea change the face of others. But soft scenery was not requisite to inspire poets who were to sing only the pre∣parations for warlike exploits, the slaughter of a battle, the deeds of their heroes, and the magic solemnities of superstitions.</P>
<P>The island, at present, exhibits to the traveller amazing slopes of lava, which once streamed from the vulcanoes, and terminated in the sea. Such is the appear∣ance, about three miles from <HI>Hafnaifoird,</HI> in lat. 64. 4. of vast masses of lava piled to a montanous height upon each other, broken, vitrified, sharp, rude, and black. In parts, sandy tracts intervene: in others, a soil peculiar to the place, a tufa, originated from the violent eruptions of impure water which rush from the moun∣tains, attendant on the fiery eruptions. Vallies composed of a very thin soil, afford grass for a numerous breed of cattle and sheep. Here is found variety of species of the best grasses; of the <HI>aira, poa, festuca,</HI> and <HI>carex.</HI> Part is harvested against winter; but not in such plenty, but that the farmer is obliged often to feed his stock with the wolf-fish, or the heads of cod-fish beaten small, and mixed with a quarter part of hay. To what food will not necessity compel both man and beast to recur!</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">WOODS LONG LOST.</NOTE>The woods of <HI>Iceland</HI> have long since vanished, unless we except a few stunted birch, scarcely ten feet high, and four inches in diameter; and a few species of willow,<NOTE PLACE="marg">DRIFT-WOOD.</NOTE> so small and so rare as scarcely to be of use to the inhabitants. But they are abundantly supplied with drift-wood from <HI>Europe</HI> and <HI>America,</HI> as appears by the species found on the shores, especially on all the northern coast, as <HI>Langaness</HI> on the north-east and <HI>Hornstrandt</HI> on the north-west. That woods were found here
<PB N="XLV" REF="60" MS="y"/>
in very remote periods, is very evident, from the quantity of <HI>suturbrand</HI> met with in several parts; which still retains traces of its vegetable origin; the marks of branches, and circles of the annual growth of the wood: some pieces are even capable of being planed. It is found in the fissures of the rocks, much compressed by their weight, and in pieces sometimes big enough to make a middle-sized table. This is sometimes used as fuel; but the want of it is sup∣plied, in some measure, by the drift-wood, by peat, and by several strange substi∣tutes, the effect of necessity. Smiths prefer the <HI>suturbrand</HI> to sea-coal in their business. The beds of this fossil strongly refute the notion of <HI>Iceland</HI> having been entirely formed by vulcanic violence, since the original creation; and raised out of the sea in later times, as others have been known to have done. <HI>Delos</HI> and <HI>Rhodos,</HI> in very remote ages; <HI>Thera,</HI> the modern <HI>Santorini,</HI> and <HI>Therasia,</HI> in the 135th <HI>Olympiad; Thia,</HI> in the time of <HI>Pliny</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Hist.

But these <HI>sutur</HI> or <HI>sorte brands</HI> are certainly the remains of antient forests, overturned and buried by earthquakes, after the golden age of the island. Let me add to this another proof, from the number of its vegetables:<NOTE PLACE="marg">PLANTS, NUMBER OF.</NOTE> there being found on it not fewer than three hundred and nine perfect, and two hundred and thirty-three cryptogamous plants.

<P>THIS vast island extends from 63. 15. to about 67. 18. north latitude: is reckoned to be five hundred and sixty <HI>English</HI> miles long, and about two hundred and fifty broad<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Mallet, <HI>i. 15.</HI></NOTE>.

It lies in the <HI>Hyperborean</HI> ocean, divided from <HI>Greenland</HI> by a sea about thirty-five leagues wide<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Kerguelin, <HI>175.</HI></NOTE>. The whole is traversed with great ridges of mountains; the highest naked, and usually free from snow, by reason of the saline and sulphurous particles with which they abound. The lower, called <HI>Jok∣keler,</HI> are cased with eternal ice and snow; and are the <HI>glacieres</HI> of <HI>Iceland.</HI> Of these, <HI>Snaefiaell Jokkel,</HI> which hangs over the sea in the west part of the island, is far the highest<NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Olaffen,</HI> i. tab. xvii.</NOTE>. Out of these, at different periods, have been tremendous eruptions of fire and water, the burst of which is attended with a most terrific noise: flames and balls of fire issue out with the smoke: and showers of stones are vomited up; of which there has been an instance of one weighing near three hundred pounds being flung to the
<PB N="XLVI" REF="61"/>
distance of four miles. The heights of the mountains have not been taken; but that of the <HI>Hecla-fiall</HI> is not far short of seventeen hundred yards. Of this species of mountain, <HI>Hecla</HI> has been most celebrated: the records of <HI>Iceland</HI> enumerate ten of its eruptions since the arrival of the <HI>Norwegians.</HI> It was the hell of the nor∣thern nations; but they seem divided in their opinions, whether the pains of the damned arose from fire, or, what was more tremendous to the natives of these countries, from the cold<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bartholinus de Contemptu Mortis, <HI>359.</HI></NOTE>.</P>

But other vulcanoes have, in the present century, proved the spiracles to the internal fires of <HI>Iceland.</HI> The vallies between the mountains are in general sandy and sterile. Fiery eruptions are not confined to the mountains. Last year they burst out of the fulphure∣ous soil of the low parts of <HI>Skaftafield Syssel</HI> or province; and the lava has overflown the country for the space of thirty miles, and has at last reached the sea, destroying every thing in its progress. It dries up the rivers, and fills their beds with lava. Moors in some places stop its course; but it totally changes their nature. It has taken to the deserts of the same province, and begins to spread to the east, or <HI>Mulé Syssel,</HI> the most populous and fruitful part of the island; nor were there any signs of its ceasing at the time when this account was sent to me<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Letter from Mr. <HI>Brunnich,</HI> dated <HI>October</HI> 31, 1783.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">HUERS, OR BOIL∣ING JETS D'EAUX.</NOTE>THE FOUNTAINS of many of the vallies are of a most extraordinary nature; are called <HI>Huers,</HI> and form at times <HI>jets d'eaux</HI> of scalding water, ninety-four feet high, and thirty in diameter, creating the most magnificent <HI>gerbes</HI> in nature! especially when backed by the setting sun. They arise out of cylindrical tubes of unknown depths: near the surface they expand into apertures of a funnel shape, and the mouths spread into large extent of stalactitical matter, formed of suc∣cessive scaly concentric undulations. The playing of these stupendous spouts is foretold by noises roaring like the cataract of <HI>Niagara.</HI> The cylinder be∣gins to fill: it rises gradually to the surface, and gradually encreases its height, smoking amazingly, and flinging up great stones. After attaining its greatest height, it gradually sinks, till it totally disappears. Boiling <HI>jets d'eaux,</HI> and boiling springs, are frequent in most parts of the island. In many parts they are applied to the culinary uses of the natives. The most capital is that which is

called <HI>Geyer,</HI> in a plain rising into small hills, and in the midst of an amphi∣theatre, bounded by the most magnificent and various-shaped icy mountains; among which the three-headed <HI>Hecla</HI> soars pre-eminent.</P>
<P>These <HI>Huers</HI> are not confined to the land. They rise in the very sea,<NOTE PLACE="marg">IN THE SEA.</NOTE> and form scalding fountains amidst the waves. Their distance from the land is unknown; but the new vulcanic isle, twelve-miles off the point of <HI>Reickenes,</HI> emitting fire and smoke, proves that the subterraneous fires and waters extend to that space; for those aweful effects arise from the united fury of these two elements<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Mr. <HI>Whiteburst's</HI> Theory.</NOTE>. The depth of water between this new creation and the <HI>Geir-fugl Skier,</HI> is forty-four fathoms; ten leagues to the west, two hundred and five: and the bottom composed of black sand<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Sable noir comme la poudre a canon. <HI>Voyage au Nord,</HI> par M. <HI>de Kerguelin,</HI> 69.</NOTE>; doubtless no other than the <HI>Pumex arenaceus,</HI> the frequent evomition of <HI>vulcanoes.</HI> How much past human comprehension must the powers have been, that could force up materials for an island, even from the medium depth I have given! and how deep beneath the bottom of the ocean must have been the causes which could supply stone, or pumice, or lava, to fill the space which this island oc∣cupies, many miles in circumference, and possibly above a hundred fathoms in depth!</P>
<P>If some islands spring out of these seas, others are swallowed by the force of earthquakes. Their foundations are undermined by the fury of the subterraneous elements, which carries off the materials of their basis, and discharges it in lava, or different forms, through the vulcanic <HI>spiracula.</HI> The earthquakes shatter the crust on which they stand, and they tumble into the great abyss. Such was the fate of the nine isles of <HI>Gouberman,</HI> which lay about four leagues from <HI>Sandaness,</HI> between <HI>Patrixfiord</HI> and <HI>Cape Nort,</HI> all which suddenly disappeared.

<P>The number of inhabitants in <HI>Iceland</HI> is computed not to exceed sixty thousand.<NOTE PLACE="marg">PEOPLE, NUMBER OF.</NOTE> Considering the ungenial surface of this vast island, probably the number is equal to the means of support. Writers apologize for the fewness of inhabi∣tants, by attributing it to the almost depopulation of the place by the <HI>sorte diod,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">PESTILENCE.</NOTE> or black death, a pestilence which commenced in <HI>Cathay,</HI> or <HI>China,</HI> in 1346, spread over all <HI>Asia,</HI> and <HI>Africa,</HI> reached the south of <HI>Europe</HI> in 1347, and in 1348 spread itself over <HI>Britain, Germany,</HI> and northern <HI>Europe,</HI> even to the extremity of the inhabited north. The small-pox, and other epidemics, are mentioned as contributing to thin the island. During the time of the plague, tradition relates,
<PB N="XLVIII" REF="63"/>
in terms most graphically horrid, that the persons who escaped to the moun∣tains, saw the whole low country covered with a thick pestiferous fog. A guess may be made at the number of inhabitants in the eleventh century; for a bishop of <HI>Schalholt</HI> caused, in 1090, all who were liable to pay tribute to be numbered: four thousand of that rank were found; so that, giving five to a family, the sum is twenty thousand<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Arngrim Jonas's Comment. Iceland, <HI>in</HI> Hackluyt, <HI>i. 556.</HI></NOTE>. Much of the labor in the northern world falls to the female part of the family; and in those patriarchal times, the sons also shared the toil. I cannot therefore under-rate the number of commonalty, or untaxable people, heads of families, at ten thousand; which, by the same rule, will give fifty thousand of the lower rank. Besides the dearth of food in this rude island, other causes contribute to prevent the increase of inhabitants. Necessity forces the men to seek from the sea subsistence, denied by their niggardly land. Con∣stant wet, cold, and hard labor, abridge the days of thousands; and that labor is in∣creased tenfold, to supply the rapacity of their masters. Incredible as it may seem, a late king of <HI>Denmark</HI> sold the whole island, and its inhabitants, to a company of merchants, for the annual rent of one thousand pounds. This company en∣slave the poor natives; who are bound to sell their fish, the staple of the island, at a low price to these monopolizers; who, dreading resistance, even have taken from them the use of fire-arms! Here is given a stronger cause of depopulation, perhaps, than the others; for <HI>Hymen</HI> can have but faint votaries in the land from whence liberty is banished. But for these causes, here ought to be found the genuine species of the <HI>Norman</HI> race, unmixed with foreign blood; as must be the case with every place remote from the rest of the world. Here are to be sought the antient customs and diet of their original stock, which are now pro∣bably worn out in the land of their distant ancestors. The luxury of food has so little crept in among them, that their meat and drink in general is peculiar to themselves; and much of the former composed of herbs neglected in other places.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">DRESS.</NOTE>The dress of the natives seems unchanged for a very considerable time: that of the men is simple, not unlike that of the <HI>Norwegian</HI> peasants<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Olaffen,</HI> i. tab. iii. <HI>Pon∣roppidan,</HI> ii. tab. p. 272.</NOTE>; that of the fe∣males is graceful, elegant, and peculiar to them, and perhaps some very old-fashioned <HI>Norwegian</HI> lady.

<P>Mr. <HI>Troil</HI> awakens our curiosity about the <HI>Icelandic</HI> antiquities; speaks of castles, and heathen temples, and burying-places, and upright stones, and mounts. Of the first I am solicitous to gain some further knowlege, for possibly they might direct to the origin of the round buildings in the <HI>Hebrides, Orknies, Schet∣land,</HI> and the north of <HI>Scotland</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Voy. Hebrides.</NOTE>: others seem to me the various <HI>Scandinavian</HI> antiquities, admirably exemplified in Baron <HI>Dahlberg's Suecia Antiqua et Moderna.</HI></P>
<P>The species of quadrupeds of this island are very few.<NOTE PLACE="marg">DOMESTIC QUA∣DRUPEDS.</NOTE> Small horses of a hardy kind; cows in great abundance, and mostly hornless, the flesh and hides of which are considerable articles of exportation. Sheep are met with in great flocks in every farm; the wool is manufactured at home, the meat salted, and, with the skins, much of it is sold to the Company, at the twenty-two ports al∣lotted for the purposes of traffic. It is remarkable, that the climate disposes their horns to grow very large, and even to exceed the number of those of the sheep of other countries; examples of three, four, and five, being extremely frequent. Goats and swine are very scarce; the first, for want of shrubs to brouze, the last through deficiency of their usual food, and the supply which the farm-yards of other countries afford.</P>
<P>The dogs are sharp-nosed, have short and sharp upright ears, bushy tails, and are full of hair. Here are domestic cats; but numbers are grown wild, and multiply among the rocks, so as to become noxious. The reader need not be reminded, that these, and every species of domestic animals, were originally in∣troduced into <HI>Iceland</HI> by the <HI>Norwegians.</HI></P>
<P>An attempt has been made to introduce the Rein Deer, <HI>Arct. Zool.</HI> N<SUP>o</SUP> 4. Those which survived the voyage have bred frequently. There can be little doubt of their succeeding, as <HI>Iceland</HI> has, in common with <HI>Lapland,</HI> most of the plants for their summer food<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Confer. Olaffen. <HI>ii. 234. and</HI> Amoen. Acad. <HI>iv. 151.</HI></NOTE>, and abundance of the Rein Deer <HI>lichen</HI> for their winter provision.</P>
<P>Rats and Mice seem to have been involuntarily transported.<NOTE PLACE="marg">RATS.</NOTE> Both the domestic species are found here; and the white variety of the Mouse, called in the <HI>Icelandic, Skogar Mys,</HI> is common in the bushes. I suspect that there is a native species, allied, as Doctor PALLAS imagines, to the Oeconomic, <HI>Arct. Zool.</HI> p. 134, A.; for, like that, it lays in a great magazine of berries by way of winter-stores. This species is particularly plentiful in the wood of <HI>Husafels.</HI> In a country where
<PB N="L" REF="65"/>
berries are but thinly dispersed, these little animals are obliged to cross rivers to make their distant forages. In their return with the booty to their magazines, they are obliged to repass the stream; of which Mr. <HI>Olaffen</HI> gives the following account:— "The party, which consists of from six to ten, select a flat piece of dried cow-dung, on which they place the berries in a heap in the middle; then, by their united force, bring it to the water's edge, and after launching it, embark, and place themselves round the heap, with their heads joined over it, and their backs to the water, their tails pendent in the stream, serving the purpose of rudders<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Olaffen,</HI> as related to him.</NOTE>." When I consider the wonderful sagacity of Beavers, and think of the management of the Squirrel, which, in cases of similar necessity, make a piece of bark their boat, and tail their sail<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Linnaeus, Klein, Rzaczinski, Scheffer.</NOTE>, I no longer hesitate to credit the relation.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">FOXES.</NOTE>The Common Fox, <HI>Arct. Zool.</HI> N<SUP>o</SUP> 11, and the Arctic, N<SUP>o</SUP> 10, are frequent; are proscribed, and killed for the sake of a reward, in order to prevent the havock they would make among the sheep.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">BEARS.</NOTE>The Polar Bear, N<SUP>o</SUP> 18, is often transported from <HI>Greenland,</HI> on the islands of ice; but no sooner is its landing discovered, than a general alarm is spread, and pursuit made till it is destroyed. The <HI>Icelanders</HI> are very intrepid in their attack on this animal; and a single man, armed only with a spear, frequently enters the lists with this tremendous beast, and never fails of victory. A person who lived near <HI>Langeness,</HI> the extreme northern point, where the Bears most frequently land, is still celebrated for having slain not fewer than twenty in single combat. There is a reward for every skin, which must be delivered to the next magistrate.</P>
<P>The Common Bat, p. 185, A. is sometimes found in this island, and finishes the list of the land-animals of the country.</P>
<P>The amphibious quadrupeds, or Seals, are very numerous. <HI>Iceland,</HI> being blessed with domestic animals, has less use of this race than other <HI>Arctic</HI> coun∣tries; yet they are of considerable advantage. The skins are used for cloathing; a good one is equal in value to the skin of a sheep, or the hide of a cow; and the fat supplies the lamps in the long nights with oil. The Common, during winter, is excessively fat, and will yield sixty pounds.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">SEALS.</NOTE> The <HI>Icelanders</HI> have two species of native Seals: the Common, N<SUP>o</SUP> 72, called by them <HI>Land Saelur,</HI> because it keeps near the coast; the other, the Great, N<SUP>o</SUP> 73, or <HI>Ut-Saelur.</HI> They are taken in nets placed in the creeks and narrow bays, which they pass through to get on shore. When it begins to grow dark the hunters make a fire, and fling into it the shavings of horns, or any thing that smells strong; this allures the Seals, who strike into the nets, and are taken.
<PB N="LI" REF="66"/>
At other times, a <HI>koder</HI> or lure is tied to a rope, and placed before the nets; to which the Seals, supposing it to be some strange animal, will eagerly swim, and strike into the nets, paying with their lives for their curiosity. This carries them sometimes so far, that they will stray to a considerable distance inland, attracted by a candle, or the fire in a smith's forge. If they are taken young, they are capable of being tamed: they will follow their master, and come to him like a dog, when called by the name which is given them. The <HI>Icelanders</HI> have a strange superstition about these animals: they believe they resemble the human species more than any other, and that they are the offspring of <HI>Pharaoh</HI> and his host, who were converted into Seals when they were overwhelmed in the <HI>Red Sea.</HI></P>
<P>Other species of Seals are migratory. Among them is the Harp, N<SUP>o</SUP> 77, or <HI>Vade-Selur.</HI> These quit the seas of <HI>Iceland</HI> in <HI>March,</HI> and swim through the streights of <HI>Davies,</HI> by some unknown opening, to the farthest north; bring forth their young, and return, by the north of <HI>Greenland,</HI> in <HI>May,</HI> extremely lean, to the north of <HI>Iceland;</HI> continue their route, and return to that island about <HI>Christ∣mas,</HI> chiefly upon the drift-ice, on which they are either shot, or harpooned. The Hooded Seal, N<SUP>o</SUP> 76, or <HI>Bladru</HI> Seal, is rarely taken here. The Walrus, N<SUP>o</SUP> 71, or <HI>Rost-unger,</HI> is sometimes wafted here from <HI>Greenland</HI> on the ice.</P>
<P>It cannot be expected,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BIRDS.</NOTE> that many of the feathered tribe should inhabit an island so very severe in its climate, and so remote from the more southern continent and islands. It is, like all other <HI>Arctic</HI> countries, the asylum to water-fowl, to breed and educate their young; but, being an inhabited place, fewer resort here than to the untrodden wastes of the more distant north. The Guland Duck, p. 572. E. may possibly be a local bird. The rest, whether land or water, are common to <HI>Norway,</HI> and many other parts of <HI>Europe.</HI> The Great Auks, N<SUP>o</SUP> 428, are found here in greater numbers than elsewhere: they inhabit and breed on the rocks, called from them <HI>Geir-fugl Skier,</HI> off the point of <HI>Raekenes,</HI> the most southern part of the island. Notwithstanding they are surrounded with a swelling sea, and tremendous breakers, the <HI>Icelanders</HI> venture there annually, in order to collect the eggs, to contribute to the provision of the year.

<P>The Raven had still higher honors in the northern nations. It was sacred to <HI>Odin,</HI> the hero and god of the north. On the sacred flag of the <HI>Danes</HI> was em∣broidered this bird. <HI>Odin</HI> was said to have been always attended by two, which sate on his shoulders; whence he was called the <HI>God of Ravens:</HI> one was styled <HI>Huginn,</HI> or <HI>Thought;</HI> the other <HI>Muninn,</HI> or <HI>Memory.</HI> They whispered in his ear all they saw or heard. In the earliest dawn, he sent them to fly round the world, and they returned before dinner, fraught with intelligence. <HI>Odin</HI> thus sang their importance:

<P><PB N="LIII" REF="68"/>The sea which surrounds <HI>Iceland</HI> is said to be more salt than usual in other countries. It leaves great saline incrustations on the rocks,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SEA.</NOTE> which the natives scrape off and use. I can, with no certainty, give the depth of the water, ex∣cept where Mr. <HI>Kerguelin</HI> sounded, ten leagues to the west of <HI>Geir-fugl Skier,</HI> where he found it to be two hundred and five fathoms<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Voyage au Mer du Nord, <HI>69.</HI></NOTE>. The equinoctial tides rise as high as sixteen feet: the ordinary tides twelve<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Horrebow, <HI>101.</HI></NOTE>. The coasts almost universally bold, those of the inlets excepted, where there appears a small strand.</P>
<P>The bays, especially those of the south,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BAYS FROZEN.</NOTE> which lie under the influence of the cold of <HI>Greenland,</HI> are annually frozen over; that of <HI>Patrixfiord</HI> was shut up even as late as the 14th of <HI>May</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Kerguelin, <HI>31.</HI></NOTE>: but the sea near the coasts never feels the influence of the frost. It is in those places deep, and agitated by a most turbulent motion. The dreaded ice is what floats from <HI>Greenland</HI> and <HI>Spitzbergen,</HI> and often fills,<NOTE PLACE="marg">FLOATING ICE.</NOTE> during the whole summer, the streight between the former and this island<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><HI>Troill,</HI> 48, 49.</NOTE>, and even extends along the northern coast, covering the sea to a vast distance from land. It consists of the two species, the mountanous ice, called <HI>Fiael-jakar;</HI> and the smooth ice of inconsiderable thickness, styled <HI>Hellu-is.</HI> These arrive generally in <HI>Ja∣nuary,</HI> and go away in <HI>March.</HI> Sometimes it does not touch the land till <HI>April,</HI> when it fixes for a considerable time, and brings to the <HI>Icelanders</HI> the most tre∣mendous evils; a multitude of polar bears, which spread their ravages far and wide among the cattle; and a cold of incredible violence, which chills the air for many miles, and even causes the horses and sheep to drop down dead<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Kerguelin, <HI>20, 175.</HI></NOTE>. To this is attributed the stunted state of the miserable woods of the country; which cause must have existed from the commencement of its iron age; for there seems to have been a period in which there had been considerable wooded tracts<NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">See p. xlv.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The bottom of the sea is probably rocky; for it abounds with greater variety of <HI>fuci</HI> than <HI>Great Britain,</HI> which give shelter to fishes innumerable; a source of wealth to the natives (were they permitted the free use) as they are of food to distant nations, the vessels of which annually resort here to fish, but without any com∣merce with the <HI>Icelanders,</HI> which is strictly prohibited. In 1767, two hundred <HI>Dutch,</HI> and eighty <HI>French</HI> doggers, of about a hundred tons each, were employ∣ed, those of each nation under the orders and protection of a frigate. They keep from four to six leagues from shore, and fish with hooks baited commonly with large mussels, in forty or fifty fathoms water. Others go to the distance of fifteen leagues, and fish in the depth of a hundred fathoms. The great cap∣ture
<PB N="LIV" REF="69"/>
is Cod. As soon as the fishermen take one, they cut off the head, wash, gut, and salt it in casks, with either rock-salt or that of <HI>Lisbon.</HI> The fishery commences in <HI>March,</HI> and ends in <HI>September.</HI> It begins at the point of <HI>Breder∣wick,</HI> and extends round the <HI>North Cape,</HI> by the isle of <HI>Grim,</HI> to the point of <HI>Langeness.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>English</HI> have entirely deserted this fishery since they have been in possession of <HI>Newfoundland.</HI> It had been, in very early times, the resort of our vessels, as is evident by the proclamation of <HI>Henry</HI> V. in order to give satisfaction for the ill conduct of some of his subjects, in 1415, on the coasts of this island<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rymer's Foed. <HI>ix. 322.</HI></NOTE>, in which he forbids them to resort to the isles of <HI>Denmark</HI> and <HI>Norway,</HI> especially to <HI>Iceland,</HI> otherwise than had been antiently customary. In 1429, the English parlement enforced this order, by making it penal for any of our subjects to trade in the <HI>Danish</HI> ports, except in <HI>North Earn</HI> or <HI>Bergen.</HI> At length, the <HI>Danish</HI> monarch wisely resolved to reserve the benefits of the fisheries to his own subjects; and in 1465 made it capital for any <HI>Englishman</HI> to trade in the ports of <HI>Iceland</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. xvi. 443.</NOTE>. Even those of <HI>Helgeland</HI> and <HI>Finmark</HI> were shut against them, unless they were driven in by a storm. I imagine that this severity must have arisen from some glaring insolence of our countrymen. But the antient treaties were revived, which were renewable by a fresh grant every seven years<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid. xv. 443.</NOTE>. In later times, even Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> deigned to ask leave of <HI>Christian</HI> IV. to fish in those seas; but afterwards instructed her ambassador to insist on the right of a free and universal fishery. The answer does not appear: but in the reign of her successor, we had not fewer than a hundred and fifty vessels employed in this fishery. Possibly we might comply with the regulations insisted on by the king of <HI>Denmark;</HI> or perhaps a greater indulgence was given, by reason of the marriage of <HI>James</HI> with his sister <HI>Anne.</HI> I observe, that the <HI>Danish</HI> prince excepts the port of <HI>Westmony,</HI> it being reserved for the peculiar supply of the royal court<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Cambden's Life of Queen Elizabeth, <HI>in the</HI> Complete Hist. of England, <HI>ii. 550.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The oppressed natives fish in the bays in boats, containing one, and never more than four men. If they venture to sea, which they seldom do to above eight miles distance, they have larger boats, manned with twelve or sixteen hands; in these they slave for the benefit of the monopolists, to whom they are com∣pelled to sell their fish at a trifling price. How weak must be the feelings of that government which can add misery to misery; and not attempt rather to be∣stow comforts on subjects condemned to such a dreadful abode!</P>
<P>The species of fish in these seas are few; but the multitudes, under several of the most useful kinds, are amazing; those of Cod in particular. Herrings pass by
<PB N="LV" REF="70"/>
this island in their annual migrations from the north, and for a short space fill every bay. Poverty and want of salt make these riches of other nations a tantalizing appearance to the unfortunate natives. This is the most northern place in which the Herring is seen: they are not found in the shallow water of <HI>Spitzbergen;</HI> neither is it probable that they double <HI>Greenland,</HI> and retire to the frozen ocean, equally wanting in depth of water;<NOTE PLACE="marg">VAST DEPTHS OF WATER.</NOTE>—are they not rather lost in the vast profundity of these very seas, in the depth of six hundred and eighty-three fathoms, in lat. 65, between this island and the north of <HI>Norway;</HI> or in the un∣fathomable depths a little farther north, where the water was found bottomless with seven hundred and eighty fathoms<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lord Mulgrave's Voy. towards the North Pole.</NOTE>?

<P>In order to view the correspondent shores of the tract I have passed over,<NOTE PLACE="marg">STREIGHTS OF DOVER.</NOTE> I shall return to the streights of <HI>Dover. Calais</HI> is seated in a low wet tract; and the whole coast, from thence to the extremity of <HI>Holland,</HI> is sandy, and fronted with sand-hills; providentially highest in that lowest of countries, in which the strongest protection against the fury of the sea is necessary. The coast of <HI>Flanders,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">SAND-BANKS OFF FLANDERS AND HOLLAND.</NOTE> the rich bait of ambi∣tion, stained with blood, is dangerous by reason of frequent narrow sand-banks, disposed in parallel rows, according to the direction of the land. The coasts of <HI>Holland</HI> are also greatly infested with sands; but between them and the land is a clear channel. From between <HI>Dunkirk</HI> and <HI>Calais,</HI> even to the <HI>Scar,</HI> at the extremity of <HI>Jutland,</HI> is low land, not to be seen but at a small distance, unless at <HI>Camperden</HI> in <HI>Holland; Heilegeland,</HI> off the mouths of the <HI>Elbe</HI> and <HI>Weser;</HI> and <HI>Robsnout,</HI> and <HI>Hartshal,</HI> in <HI>Jutland.</HI> While the opposite coasts of <HI>England</HI> are comparatively high, and the channel deep, these are universally obstructed with sand: the great <HI>German</HI> rivers bring down by their floods amazing quantities of sand and mud, the course of which is impeded at sea by the violence of the winds, blowing at south and west two-thirds of the year<NOTE N="†" PLACE="marg">Yarranton's England's Improvement, <HI>4, 5.</HI></NOTE>. These, with the help of the tides, arrest the progress of the sand into the open sea, and form the numerous banks which, fatal as they may be to mariners, are the security of <HI>Holland,</HI> in particular, from naval invasions. The spring-tides at <HI>Calais</HI> rise twenty feet; at the pier head at <HI>Dover,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">TIDES.</NOTE> to twenty-five; the cause of the variation is supposed, by Mr. <HI>Cowley,</HI> to be the different dis∣tances of the two piers from low-water mark, the first being half a mile, the last only a hundred yards; at <HI>Ostend</HI> it rises to eighteen; at <HI>Flushing,</HI> sixteen and a half; at <HI>Helvoetsluys</HI> and the <HI>Texel,</HI> twelve; and on the coasts of <HI>Holstein</HI> and <HI>Jut∣land,</HI> where the sea expands to a more considerable breadth, the tides grow more irregular, and weaken both in height and strength; at the <HI>Elbe</HI> they do not ex∣ceed

The first, from the <HI>Welsh, môr,</HI> sea, and <HI>marw,</HI> dead; the other from the <HI>Irish, muir-croinn,</HI> the coagulated, <HI>i. e. congealed sea. Tacitus</HI> adds to his account, that it was believed to encir∣cle
<PB N="LXV" REF="80"/>
the whole globe, and that the last light of the setting sun continued so very vivid as to obscure the stars themselves. There is not a single circumstance of exag∣geration in all this: every winter the gulph is frozen, and becomes motionless. Many instances may be adduced even of the <HI>Baltic</HI> itself being frozen<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Forster's Obs. <HI>80.</HI></NOTE>. The stars are frequently lost in the amazing splendor and various colors of the <HI>aurora borealis.</HI> The <HI>Hilleviones,</HI> an antient people of <HI>Sweden,</HI> styled <HI>Scandinavia, al∣terum orbem terrarum,</HI> and their descendants, long carolled the junction of the <HI>Bothnian</HI> gulph with the northern ocean, traditionally rehearsed in old <HI>Swedish</HI> songs. <HI>Tacitus</HI> uses the two last words to express the world surrounded by this sea. In the days of the geographer <HI>Mela,</HI> there certainly was a strong tide in this upper part of the <HI>Baltic;</HI> for, speaking of the islands off <HI>Finland,</HI> he says, <Q>Quae <HI>Sarmatis</HI> adversa sunt, ob alternos accessus recursusque pelagi, et quod spatia queis distant, modò operiuntur undis, modò nuda sunt; aliàs insulae videntur, aliàs una et continens terra.</Q> With propriety, therefore, in another place, does he compare it to a streight, <HI>par freto,</HI> notwithstanding he was ignorant of its other entrance.<NOTE PLACE="marg">ANTIENT STREIGHTS BE∣TWEEN</NOTE> Doctor <HI>Pallas</HI> most justly ascribes the formation of not only the <HI>Baltic,</HI> but its former communication with the <HI>White Sea,</HI> to the effects of a deluge. The whole intermediate country is a proof; the foundation being what is called the old rock, and that covered with variety of matter; such as beds of pebble and gravel, and fragments of granite, torn from the great mass.<NOTE PLACE="marg">THE BALTIC AND WHITE SEA.</NOTE> Parts of the channel which formed the insulation of <HI>Scandinavia,</HI> are the chain of lakes, from that of <HI>Ladoga</HI> to the <HI>White Sea,</HI> such as <HI>Onega,</HI> and others, often connected by rivers, and lying in a low country, filled with the proofs above-mentioned. This was the streight through which the tide poured itself from the <HI>Hyperborean</HI> ocean, and covered, at its flux, the islands described by <HI>Mela.</HI> This, like the other northern seas, was annually frozen over, and could be no obstacle to the stocking of <HI>Scandinavia</HI> with quadrupeds. There is no fixing the period in which this passage was ob∣structed. An influx of sand, or an earthquake, might close it up. As soon as this event took place, the <HI>Baltic</HI> felt the want of its usual feed: it lost the pro∣perty of a sea; and, by a constant exhalation, from that time decreased in the quantity of water. Modern philosophers have proved the great loss it has sus∣tained, and that it decreases from forty to fifty inches in a century: that, near <HI>Pithea,</HI> the gulph of <HI>Bothnia</HI> has retired from the land half a mile in forty-five years; and near <HI>Lulea,</HI> a mile in twenty-eight. Notwithstanding its present state, when we consider the accounts given by the antients, the old <HI>Swedish</HI> tra∣ditions, and the present vestiges of the former channel, we can, without any

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">SUIONES.</NOTE>The <HI>Suiones</HI> possessed the modern <HI>Sweden,</HI> and extended even to the ocean, and were a potent naval power. Their ships were so constructed, with prows at each end, that they were always ready to advance. These people, in after times, proved, under the common name of <HI>Nortmans,</HI> the pest and conquerors of great part of southern <HI>Europe;</HI> their skill in maritime affairs fitting them for distant expeditions. In the sixth century they were called <HI>Suethans,</HI> and were famous for their cavalry. In their time, the Sable, N<SUP>o</SUP> 30, was common in their country: <HI>Jornandes,</HI> therefore, observes, that notwithstanding they lived poorly, they were most richly cloathed: he also informs us, that they supplied the <HI>Romans</HI> with these precious furs, through the means of numbers of interven∣ing nations<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Jornandes de Reb.

<P>After repassing the Sound, appear <HI>Schonen, Halland,</HI> and <HI>Bohustand, Swedish</HI> pro∣vinces, bounded by the <HI>Kattegatte.

<P>Our first certain knowlege of the inhabitants of this country, was from the desolation they brought on the southern nations by their piratical invasions.

Their country had, before that period, the name of <HI>Nortmannaland,</HI> and the in∣habitants <HI>Nortmans;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">NORTMANS.</NOTE> a title which included other adjacent people. <HI>Great Britain</HI> and <HI>Ireland</HI> were ravaged by them in 845; and they continued their invasion till they effected the conquest of <HI>England,</HI> under their leader, <HI>Canute</HI> the Great. They went up the <HI>Seine</HI> as far as <HI>Paris,</HI> burnt the town, and forced its weak monarch to purchase their absence at the price of fourteen thousand marks. They plun∣dered <HI>Spain,</HI> and at length carried their excursions through the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> to <HI>Italy,</HI> and even into <HI>Sicily.</HI> They used narrow vessels, like their ancestors the <HI>Sitones;</HI> and, besides oars, added the improvement of two sails: and victualled them with salted provisions, biscuit, cheese, and beer. Their ships were at first small; but in after times they were large enough to hold a hundred or a hundred and twenty men. But the multitude of vessels was amazing. The fleet of <HI>Harold Blaatand</HI> consisted of seven hundred<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mallet's Introd. <HI>i. 257.</HI></NOTE>.

Probably necessity, more than ambition, caused them to discharge their country of its exuberant numbers. Multitudes were destroyed; but multitudes remained, and peopled more favorable climes.</P>
<P>Their king, <HI>Olaus,</HI> was a convert to Christianity in 994; <HI>Bernard,</HI> an <HI>Eng∣lishman,</HI> had the honor of baptizing him, when <HI>Olaus</HI> happened to touch at one of the <HI>Scilly</HI> islands. He plundered with great spirit during several years; and in 1006 received the crown of martyrdom from his pagan subjects. But reli∣gious zeal first gave the rest of <HI>Europe</HI> a knowlege of their country, and the sweets of its commerce. The <HI>Hanse</HI> towns poured in their missionaries, and reaped a temporal harvest. By the year 1204, the merchants obtained from the wise prince <HI>Suer</HI> every encouragement to commerce; and by that means introduced wealth and civilization into his barren kingdom. <HI>England,</HI> by every method, cherished the advantages resulting from an intercourse with <HI>Norway;</HI> and <HI>Bergen</HI> was the <HI>emporium. Henry</HI> III. in 1217, entered into a league with its monarch <HI>Haquin,</HI> by which both princes stipulated for free access for their subjects into their respective kingdoms, free trade and security to their persons. In 1269, <HI>Henry</HI> entered into another treaty with <HI>Magnus,</HI> in which it was agreed, that no goods should be exported from either kingdom except they had been paid for; and there is besides a humane provision on both sides, for the security of the persons and effects of the subjects who should suffer shipwreck on their several coasts.</P>
<P>This country extends above fifteen hundred miles in length,<NOTE PLACE="marg">COASTS.</NOTE> and exhibits a most wonderful appearance of coast. It runs due north to Cape <HI>Staff,</HI> the

Multitudes of narrow creeks penetrate deep into the land, overshadowed by stupendous mountains. The sides of these chasms have depth equal to that of the adjacent sea; but in the middle is a channel called <HI>Dybrendes,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">DYBRENDES.</NOTE> i. e. deep courses, from fifty to a hundred fa∣thoms broad, and of the disproportionable depth of four hundred<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The same, i. 68.</NOTE>, seemingly time-worn by the strength of the current from the torrent-rivers which pour into them. Fish innumerable resort to their edges. These creeks are, in many places, the roads of the country; for the vallies which traverse it are often so precipitous as to be impervious, unless by water. Some, which want these con∣veniences, are left uninhabited by reason of the impossibility of conveying to and from them the articles of commerce.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAIN OF IS∣LANDS.</NOTE>Millions of islands, large and small, skerries, or rocks, follow the greatest part of this wondrous coast. The islands are rude and mountanous, and soar corre∣spondent to the <HI>Alps</HI> of the opposite continent. Those of <HI>Loeffort,</HI> on the north side of the dreadful whirlpool <HI>Maelstrom,</HI> engraven by <HI>Le Bruyn,</HI> give a full idea of the nature of the coasts<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Le Bruyn's Voyages, <HI>i. tab. 1.</HI></NOTE>.

Septentr. <HI>lib. ii. c. xi.</HI></NOTE> to the sides, to enable ships to moor in security, or to assist them in warping out. A few of the former give shelter to the fishermen and their small stock of cattle; the rest rise in columns of grotesque forms. On the outside of these natural counterscarps, are multitudes of <HI>haubroe,</HI> or sea-breakers, longitudinal banks of sand, running north and south, from the distance of four to sixteen leagues from the continent, and from ten to fifteen fathoms below the surface of the water; the haunts of myriads of useful fish.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">TIDES.</NOTE>The tides off the <HI>Naze,</HI> and most of the coasts of <HI>Norway,</HI> are very inconsider∣able. At the <HI>North Cape,</HI> the spring tides have been observed to rise to the height of eight feet one inch; the neap to six feet eight inches<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mr.</HI> Bayley, <HI>in</HI> Phil.

for the conveyance of the great article of commerce, the masts and timber of the country, from the otherwise inaccessible forests. The trees are cut down, and at present conveyed from some distance to the rivers, down which they are precipi∣tated over rocks and stupendous cataracts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">LENTZES.</NOTE> until they arrive at the <HI>Lentzes</HI> or booms<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Pontoppidan,</HI> i. 93. tab. vii.</NOTE>, placed obliquely in the stream in fit places. To them the owners of the timber resort; and, on paying a certain rate to the proprietors, receive their pieces, which are all marked before they are committed to the water; but numbers are injured or destroyed in the rough passage.</P>
<P>The species which is of such great value to <HI>Norway,</HI> is the <HI>Fyr</HI> or <HI>Fare,</HI> our <HI>Scotch</HI> Pine, and the <HI>Pinus Sylvestris</HI> of <HI>Linnaeus.</HI> It grows in the driest places, and attains the vast age of four hundred years<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Amoen. Acad. <HI>iv.</HI></NOTE>; and is of universal use in the northern world. Such trees as are not destined for masts are squared, and arrive in <HI>England</HI> under the name of <HI>Balk:</HI> the rest are sawed on the spot, in hundreds of mills, turned by the torrents, and reach us in form of planks. An immense quan∣tity of tar is made from the trees, and even from the roots, very long after they have been divided from the trunk. The <HI>Gran, Pinus Abies,</HI> or what we call <HI>Nor∣way</HI> Fir, is in little esteem. Thousands are cut down annually by the peasants, who feed their cattle with the tender shoots. It is the tallest of <HI>European</HI> trees, growing to the height of a hundred and sixty feet. In winter, the branches are depressed to the ground with snow, and form beneath them the dens of wild beasts.</P>
<P>I must here mention the adventitious fruits,<NOTE PLACE="marg">EXOTIC FRUITS FOUND ON THE SHORES.</NOTE> such as nuts and other vegetable productions, which are brought by the waves to these shores, those of <HI>Feroe,</HI> and the <HI>Orknies,</HI> from <HI>Jamaica</HI> and other neighboring parts<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Voy. Hebrides.</NOTE>. We must have re∣course to a cause very remote from this place.<NOTE PLACE="marg">GULPH-STREAM.</NOTE> Their vehicle is the gulph-stream from the gulph of <HI>Mexico.</HI> The trade-winds force the great body of the ocean from the westward through the <HI>Antilles</HI> into that gulph, when it is forced back∣ward along the shore from the mouth of the <HI>Mississipi</HI> to Cape <HI>Florida;</HI> doubles that cape in the narrow sea between it and <HI>Cuba,</HI> and from Cape <HI>Florida</HI> to Cape <HI>Cannaveral</HI> runs nearly north, at the distance of from five to seven leagues from shore, and extends in breadth from fifteen to eighteen leagues. There are re∣gular soundings from the land to the edge of the stream, where the depth is ge∣nerally seventy fathoms; after that no bottom can be found. The soundings off Cape <HI>Cannaveral</HI> are very steep and uncertain, as the water shallows so quick, that from forty fathoms it will immediately lessen to fifteen, and from that to four, or less; so that, without great care, a ship may be in a few minutes on shore. It must be observed, that, notwithstanding the gulph-stream in general
<PB N="LXX" REF="85"/>
is said to begin where soundings end, yet its influence extends several leagues within the soundings; and vessels often find a considerable current setting to the northward all along the coast, till they get into eight or ten fathom water, even where the soundings stretch to twenty leagues from the shore; but their current is generally augmented or lessened by the prevaling winds, the force of which, however, can but little affect the grand unfathomable stream. From Cape <HI>Cannaveral</HI> to Cape <HI>Hatteras</HI> the soundings begin to widen in the extent of their run from the shore to the inner edge of the stream, the distance being generally near twenty leagues, and the soundings very regular to about seventy fathoms near the edge of the stream, where no bottom can be afterwards found. Abreast of <HI>Savannah</HI> river, the current sets nearly north; after which, as if from a bay, it stretches north-east to Cape <HI>Hatteras;</HI> and from thence it sets east-north-east, till it has lost its force. As Cape <HI>Hatteras</HI> runs a great way into the sea, the edge of the stream is only from five to seven leagues distant from the cape; and the force and rapidity of the main stream has such influence, within that distance, over ships bound to the southward, that in very high foul winds, or in calms, they have frequently been hurried back to the northward, which has often occasioned great disappointment both to merchant ships and to men of war, as was often experienced in the late war. In <HI>December</HI> 1754, an exceeding good sailing ship, bound from <HI>Philadelphia</HI> to <HI>Charlestown,</HI> got abreast of Cape <HI>Hatteras</HI> every day during thirteen days, sometimes even with the tide, and in a middle distance be∣tween the cape and the inner edge of the stream; yet the ship was forced back regularly, and could only recover its lost way with the morning breeze, till the fourteenth day, when a brisk gale helped it to stem the current, and get to the southward of the Cape. This shews the impossibility of any thing which has fallen into the stream returning, or stopping in its course.</P>
<P>On the outside of the stream is a strong eddy or contrary current towards the ocean; and on the inside, next to <HI>America,</HI> a strong tide sets against it. When it sets off from Cape <HI>Hatteras,</HI> it takes a current nearly north-east; but in its course meets a great current that sets from the north, and probably comes from <HI>Hudson's Bay,</HI> along the coast of <HI>Labrador,</HI> till the island of <HI>Newfoundland</HI> divides it; part setting along the coast through the streights of <HI>Belleisle,</HI> and sweep∣ing past Cape <HI>Breton,</HI> runs obliquely against the gulph-stream, and gives it a more eastern direction: the other part of the northern current is thought to join it on the eastern side of <HI>Newfoundland.</HI> The influence of these joint cur∣rents must be far felt; yet possibly its force is not so great, nor contracted in such a pointed and circumscribed direction as before they encountered. The prevaling winds all over this part of the ocean are the west and north-west, and con∣sequently
<PB N="LXXI" REF="86"/>
the whole body of the western ocean seems, from their influence, to have what the mariners call a <HI>set</HI> to the eastward, or to the north-east by east. Thus the productions of <HI>Jamaica,</HI> and other places bordering on the gulph of <HI>Mexico,</HI> may be first brought by the stream out of the gulph, inveloped in the <HI>sargasso</HI> or alga of the gulph round Cape <HI>Florida,</HI> and hurried by the current ei∣ther along the <HI>American</HI> shore, or sent into the ocean in the course along the stream, and then by the set of the stream, and the prevaling winds, which generally blow two-thirds of the year, wafted to the shores of <HI>Europe,</HI> where they are found<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">For this curious account, I am indebted to Doctor <HI>Garden,</HI> who, by his long residence in <HI>Charles∣town,</HI> is extremely well acquainted with the subject.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>The mountains and islands break into very grotesque forms, and would furnish admirable subjects for the pencil.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">HEIGHTS OF MOUNTAINS.</NOTE>I agree with the Comte <HI>De Buffon,</HI> in thinking that the heights of the <HI>Scan∣dinavian</HI> mountains, given by Bishop <HI>Pontoppidan,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Browallius,</HI> are ex∣tremely exaggerated<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Epoques de la Nature, <HI>Suppl. tom. vi. p. 136. edit.</HI> Amsterdam.</NOTE>. They are by no means to be compared with those of the <HI>Helvetian</HI> Alps, and less so with many near the equator. The sober accounts I have received from my northern friends, serve to confirm the opinion, that there is an increase of height of mountains from the north towards the equato∣rial countries. M. <HI>Ascanius,</HI> professor of mineralogy at <HI>Drontheim,</HI> assures me, that from some late surveys, the highest in that diocese are not above six hun∣dred fathoms above the surface of the sea; that the mountains fall to the western side from the distance of eight or ten <HI>Norwegian</HI> miles<NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Of 18,000 feet each.</NOTE>; but to the eastern, from that of forty. The highest is <HI>Dovre-fiael</HI> in <HI>Drontheim,</HI> and <HI>Tille</HI> in <HI>Ber∣gen.</HI> They rise slowly, and do not strike the eye like <HI>Romsdale-horn,</HI> and <HI>Horn∣alen,</HI> which soar majestically from the sea. In <HI>Sweden,</HI> only one mountain has been properly measured to the sea. Professor <HI>Ritzius</HI> of <HI>Lund,</HI> acquaints me, that <HI>Kinnekulle</HI> in <HI>Westro-Gothia</HI> is only eight hundred and fifteen <HI>English</HI> feet
<PB N="LXXIII" REF="88"/>
above the lake <HI>Wenern,</HI> or nine hundred and thirty-one above the sea. He adds, the following have been only measured to their bases, or to the next adjacent waters: <HI>Aorskata,</HI> a solitary mountain of <HI>Jaemtland,</HI> about four or five <HI>Swedish</HI> miles from the highest <HI>Alps,</HI> which separate <HI>Norway</HI> and <HI>Sweden,</HI> is said to be six thousand one hundred and sixty-two <HI>English</HI> feet above the nearest rivers: <HI>Swuckustol,</HI> within the borders of <HI>Norway,</HI> four thousand six hundred and fifty-eight above lake <HI>Famund;</HI> and that lake is thought to be two or three thousand above the sea: and finally, <HI>Sylfiaellen,</HI> on the borders of <HI>Jaemtland,</HI> is three thousand one hundred and thirty-two feet perpendicular, from the height to the base. <HI>Pontoppidan</HI> gives the mountains of <HI>Norway</HI> the height of three thousand fathoms: <HI>Browallius</HI> those of <HI>Sweden</HI> two thousand three hundred and thirty-three, which makes them nearly equal to the highest <HI>Alps</HI> of <HI>Savoy,</HI> or the still higher summits of the <HI>Peruvian Andes.</HI></P>

<P>The <HI>Scotch</HI> Pine, N<SUP>o</SUP> 346, and <HI>Norway</HI> Fir, N<SUP>o</SUP> 347, form the immense forests of <HI>Lapland,</HI> associated with the Birch: the Pine affects the dry, the Fir the wet places, and grow to a vast size; but, being inaccessible, are lost to the great uses of man∣kind. On their northern sides they are almost naked, and deprived of boughs by the piercing winds; the wandering <HI>Laplander</HI> remarks this, and uses it as a compass to steer by, amidst these wilds of wood. Whole traits are oft-times fired by light∣ning; then prostrated by the next storm.

form their bows for shooting the squirrel with pieces united with glue, made from the skin of the perch.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">THOSE OF USE.</NOTE>These are not the fishes of general use. Providence hath, in these parts, bestow∣ed with munificence the species which contribute to the support of mankind; and made thereby the kingdom of <HI>Norway</HI> a coast of hardy fishermen. The chain of islands, and the shores, are the populous parts. It is the sea which yields them a harvest; and near to it stand all the capital towns: the staples of the produce of the ocean on one hand, and of the more thinly inhabited mountains on the other. The farther you advance inland, the less numerous is the race of man.</P>
<P>The Herring,<NOTE PLACE="marg">HERRINGS.</NOTE> the Cod, the Ling, and the Salmon, are the maritime wealth of this country. The Herring has two emigrations into this sea: the first is from <HI>Christmas</HI> to <HI>Candlemas,</HI> when a large species arrives, preceded by two species of Whales, who, by instinct, wait its coming. The fishermen post themselves on some high cliff, impatiently waiting for the cetaceous fish, the harbingers of the others. They look for them at the moon <HI>Torre,</HI> or the first new one after <HI>Christ∣mas,</HI> and the moon <HI>Gio,</HI> which immediately follows.</P>
<P>These Herrings frequent the great sand-banks, where they deposit their spawn. They are followed by the Spring Herrings, a lesser fish, which approach much nearer to the shore; after which arrive the Summer Herring, which almost literally fill every creek: the whole fishery is of immense profit. From <HI>January</HI> to <HI>October,</HI>
<PB N="LXXVII" REF="92"/>
1752, were exported, from <HI>Bergen</HI> alone, eleven thousand and thirteen lasts; and it was expected that as many more would be shipped off before the expiration of the year. The Herrings which visit this coast are only part of the vast northern army which annually quits the great deeps, and gives wealth and food to numbers of <HI>European</HI> nations.</P>
<P>THE Cod yields another fishery of great profit.<NOTE PLACE="marg">COD.</NOTE> They first arrive immediately after the earliest Herrings, and grow so pampered with their fry, that they reject a bait; and are taken in vast nets, which are set down in fifty or seventy fathom water, and taken up every twenty-four hours, with four or five hundred great fish entangled in them. As the Herrings retire, the Cod grows hungry; and after that is taken with hook and line, baited with Herring. In more advanced season, other varieties of Cod arrive, and are taken, in common with Turbot and other fish, with long lines, to which two hundred short lines with hooks are fastened: the whole is sunk to the bottom; its place is marked by a buoy fastened to it by another line of fit length. The extent of the Cod-fishery may be judged of on hearing that 40,000 <HI>tonder,</HI> of four bushels each, of <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Spanish</HI> salt, are annually im∣ported into <HI>Bergen</HI> for that purpose only.</P>
<P>The Ling is taken on the great sand-bank during summer, by hook and line,<NOTE PLACE="marg">LING.</NOTE> and, being a fish noted for being capable of long preservation, is much sought after for distant voyages.</P>
<P>The <HI>Salmon,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">SALMON.</NOTE> a most universal northern fish, arrive in the <HI>Norwegian</HI> rivers, and vast quanties are sent, smoke-dried or pickled, into various countries.</P>

The prospect dreary, black, where not hid with snow, and broken into a thousand precipices.

In the spring, at the breaking up of the ice, vast inundations spread over the land, and sweep away whole forests, with the aid of the vast fragments of ice; these are carried off, rooted up, and appear entire in various places.

<P>The islands of the <HI>Seven Sisters,</HI> last of known land, lie due north from <HI>North-East∣land:</HI> the extreme point of the most remote is in lat. 80. 42. They are all high primaeval isles: from a high mountain on the farthest, the hardy navigators of 1773 had a sight of ten or twelve leagues of smooth unbroken ice to the east and north-east, bounded only by the horizon; and to the south-east certain land laid down in the <HI>Dutch</HI> maps. Midway between these islands and <HI>North-Eastland,</HI> Lord <HI>Mulgrave,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">VOYAGE BY LORD MULGRAVE. IN 1773.</NOTE> after every effort which the most finished seaman could make to accomplish the end of his voyage, was caught in the ice, and was near experiencing the unhappy fate of the gallant <HI>Englishman,</HI> Sir <HI>Hugh Willoughby,</HI> who was frozen in 1553, with all his crew, in his unhappy expedition.</P>
<P>The scene, divested of the horror from the eventful expectation of change, was the most beautiful and picturesque:—Two large ships becalmed in a vast bason, surrounded on all sides by islands of various forms: the weather clear: the sun gilding the circumambient ice, which was low, smooth, and even; covered with snow, excepting where the pools of water on part of the surface appeared crystalline with the young ice<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Phips Voy. <HI>tab. iv.</HI></NOTE>: the small space of sea they were confined in perfectly smooth.

The smooth extent of surface was soon lost: the pressure of the pieces of ice, by the violence of the swell, caused them to <HI>pack;</HI> fragment rose upon fragment, till they were in many places higher than the main-yard. The movements of the ships were tremendous and involuntary, in conjunction with the surrounding ice, actuated by the currents. The water shoal∣ed to fourteen fathoms. The grounding of the ice or of the ships would have been equally fatal: the force of the ice might have crushed them to atoms, or have lifted them out of the water and overset them, or have left them suspended on the summits of the pieces of ice at a tremendous height, exposed to the fury of the winds, or to the risque of being dashed to pieces by the failure of their frozen dock<NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">See these distressful situations in tab.

attempt was made to cut a passage through the ice; after a perseverance worthy of <HI>Britons,</HI> it proved fruitless. The commander, at all times master of himself, directed the boats to be made ready to be hauled over the ice, till they arrived at navigable water (a task alone of seven days) and in them to make their voyage to <HI>England.</HI> The boats were drawn progressively three whole days<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Phips Voy. <HI>tab. v.</HI></NOTE>. At length a wind sprung up, the ice separated sufficiently to yield to the pressure of the full-sailed ships, which, after laboring against the resisting fields of ice<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Same, tab. vi.</NOTE>, arrived on the 10th of <HI>August</HI> in the harbor of <HI>Smeeringberg,</HI> at the west end of <HI>Spitzbergen,</HI> be∣tween it and <HI>Hackluyt's Headland.</HI></P>
<P>It was the hard fortune of Lord <HI>Mulgrave,</HI> at this season, to meet with one of those amazing shoals of ice which cover, at times, these seas, for multitudes of leagues. He made the fullest trial, from long. 2 to 21 east, and from about lat. 80. 40, as low as about 78. 30, opposed by a face of ice without the least opening, and with all the appearance of a solid wall. It is well known, that the coasts of <HI>Sibiria</HI> are, after a northern tempest, rendered inaccessible for a vast extent, by the polar ice being set in motion. It is as well known, that a strong southern wind will again drive them to their former seats, and make the shores of the Frozen ocean as clear as the equatorial seas. A farther discovery on this side was denied to the noble navigator. His misfortune will for ever redound to his honor, as it proved his spirit, his perseverance, and a soul fertile in expedients among the greatest dif∣ficulties!</P>
<P>That navigators have gone into higher latitudes I cannot deny: the authenticated instances only shew their accidental good fortune, in having the ice driven towards the pole, and in making a retreat before they were enveloped in the returning ice. The <HI>Russians,</HI> under vice-admiral <HI>Tshitshaghef,</HI> within these very few years, made an attempt to sail to the pole by the eastern side of <HI>Spitzbergen;</HI> but after suffering great hardships, returned without effecting any discovery. Curiosity has been amply satisfied: and I believe we may rest fully content with the common pas∣sage to <HI>India,</HI> on the conviction of this tract being totally impracticable.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">ICE.</NOTE>The forms assumed by the ice in this chilling climate, are extremely pleasing to even the most incurious eye. The surface of that which is congealed from the sea-water (for I must allow it two origins) is flat and even, hard, opake, resembling white sugar, and incapable of being slid on, like the <HI>British</HI> ice<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Crantz. <HI>i. 31.</HI></NOTE>. The greater pieces, or fields, are many leagues in length: the lesser, are the meadows

of the Seals, on which those animals at times frolic by hundreds. The motion of the lesser pieces is as rapid as the currents: the greater, which are sometimes two hundred leagues long, and sixty or eighty broad<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Crantz, <HI>i. 31.</HI></NOTE>, move slow and majestically; often fix for a time, immoveable by the power of the ocean, and then produce near the horizon that bright white appearance, called by manners the <HI>blink of the ice</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Phips, <HI>72.</HI></NOTE>. The approximation of two great fields produces a most singular phaenomenon; it forces the lesser (if the term can be applied to pieces of several acres square) out of the water, and adds them to their surface: a second, and often a third succeeds; so that the whole forms an aggregate of a tremendous height. These float in the sea like so many rugged mountains, and are sometimes five or six hundred yards thick<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ellis's Voy. <HI>127.</HI></NOTE>; but the far greater part is concealed beneath the water. These are continually encreased in height by the freezing of the spray of the sea, or of the melting of the snow, which falls on them. Those which remain in this frozen climate, re∣ceive continual growth; others are gradually wafted by the northern winds into southern latitudes, and melt by degrees, by the heat of the sun, till they waste away, or disappear in the boundless element.</P>
<P>The collision of the great fields of ice, in high latitudes, is often attended with a noise that for a time takes away the sense of hearing any thing else; and the lesser with a grinding of unspeakable horror.</P>
<P>The water which dashes against the mountanous ice freezes into an infinite variety of forms; and gives the voyager ideal towns, streets, churches, steeples, and every shape which imagination can frame<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Marten, <HI>37.</HI> Crantz, <HI>i. 31.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The <HI>Icebergs,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">ICEBERGS.</NOTE> or <HI>Glacieres</HI> of the north-east of <HI>Spitzbergen,</HI> are among the ca∣pital wonders of the country; they are seven in number, but at considerable distances from each other: each fills the vallies for tracts unknown, in a region totally inaccessible in the internal parts. The <HI>glacieres</HI> of <HI>Switzerland</HI> seem con∣temptible to these; but present often a similar front into some lower valley. The last exhibits over the sea a front three hundred feet high, emulating the emerald in color: cataracts of melted snow precipitate down various parts, and black spir∣ing mountains, streaked with white, bound the sides, and rise crag above crag, as far as eye can reach in the back, ground<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">See the beautiful plate in <HI>Phips's Voy.</HI> tab. vii.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>Nature, in the formation of these islands,<NOTE PLACE="marg">MOUNTAINS.</NOTE> preserves the same rule which she does in other places: the highest mountains are on the western side; and they gradually lower to the east.

<P>Earth and soil are denied to those dreadful regions: their composition is stone, formed by the sublime hand of Almighty Power; not frittered into segments by fissures, transverse or perpendicular, but at once cast into one immense and solid mass; a mountain is but a single stone throughout, destitute of fissures, except in places cracked by the resistless power of frost, which often causes lapses, attend∣ed with a noise like thunder, scattering over their bases rude and extensive ruins. The stone is granite, mostly grey and black; some red, white, and yellow. I strongly suspect, that veins of iron are intermixed; for the meltings of the snow tinge the rocks frequently with a ferruginous ochre.

<P>It is difficult to account for the means which the Foxes find for support, as the island is destitute of birds during the whole winter; and, the bays being totally frozen up, they can find no subsistence from the sea.

<P>In the year 1633 seven <HI>Dutch</HI> sailors were left voluntarily on the western part of <HI>Spitzbergen,</HI> to pass the winter, and form their remarks.

In the next year, seven other unhappy men devoted themselves, and died in the same manner. Of the first set, it appeared by his journal, that the last was alive the 30th of <HI>April</HI> 1634; of the second, the life of the last survivor did not continue far beyond the 28th of <HI>February</HI> 1635<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Churchill's Coll. <HI>ii. 415, 427.</HI></NOTE>.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">DISCOVERY OF SPITZBERGEN.</NOTE>The priority of discovery of these islands has been a great matter of controversy between the <HI>English</HI> and the <HI>Dutch.</HI> We clame it from the sight which Sir <HI>Hugh Willoughby</HI> is pretended to have had of it in his unfortunate voyage; but if what he saw, in lat. 72, was not a fog-bank, we must suppose it to have been either <HI>John Mayen</HI>'s isle, or part of <HI>East Greenland.</HI> The absurd zeal of the <HI>English</HI> compilers makes <HI>Stephen Boroughs</HI> the second discoverer of this country, in 1556; but it is very certain, that he never got higher than lat. 70. 42, nor ever meant any discovery but a passage to the river <HI>Ob</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Hackluyt,</HI> i. 274, 280.</NOTE>. It doubt∣lessly was first discovered by the <HI>Dutch Barentz;</HI> who, in his third voyage, in 1596, for the finding out the north-east passage, met with a land in lat. 79 ½, and anchored in a good road, in eighteen fathom water. He afterwards sailed as high as 80, and found two of the islands of which <HI>Spitzbergen</HI> is composed<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Trois Voyages au Nord, <HI>&amp;c. par</HI> Girard de Ver, <HI>p. 14, 15.</HI></NOTE>. Embar∣rassed with ice, he took a southern course, and was soon after wreeked on the coast of <HI>Nova Zemlja:</HI> but the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> pursued the hint; and the Whale-fishery, which before was chiefly carried on by the <HI>Biscayeners</HI> in the bay of <HI>St. Laurence,</HI> was commenced here with great success. So active were we, that our ships frequented the place within two years after its discovery.</P>
<P>I now return to the <HI>North Cape</HI> on the coast of <HI>Finmark;</HI> and after passing by the several places mentioned in pages lxxix. and lxxx. enter a streight, bounded by <HI>Muscovitish Finmark,</HI> consisting of low hills, and the flat province of <HI>Mesen,</HI> on the east. This leads into the <HI>Biocle Mari,</HI> or <HI>White Sea,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">WHITE SEA.</NOTE> or, more pro∣perly, gulph; for its waters are shallow, its bottom full of mud, brought by the great rivers which discharge themselves into it, which almost deprive it of saltness. This was the <HI>Cwen</HI> sea of <HI>Octher;</HI> but had been forgotten since his time. The <HI>Dwina,</HI> or <HI>Double River,</HI> is the greatest, which takes its name from being formed by the <HI>Suchona</HI> and the <HI>Yug,</HI> very remote from its mouth. It is navigable to a great distance, and brings the commodities of the interior parts of the empire to <HI>Archangel,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">ARCHANGEL.</NOTE> a city seated on its banks, about six miles from the sea. It rose from a castle built there by <HI>Basilowitz</HI> II. to protect the in∣creasing

trade brought here on the discovery of the <HI>White Sea</HI> by the <HI>English;</HI> for ships of all nations resorted to this port, even as far as from <HI>Venice.</HI> Its exports, in 1655, amounted to three hundred and thirty thousand pounds<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Anderson's Dict. <HI>i. 97.</HI></NOTE>. <HI>Peter</HI> the Great, intent on aggrandizing his creation, <HI>Petersburg,</HI> prohibited all trade to <HI>Archangel,</HI> except from the neighboring provinces. Still its exports of tar were considerable: in 1730, to the amount of forty thousand lasts, of eleven barrels each<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The same, 328.</NOTE>. It sends, during winter, great quantities of the <HI>Nawaga,</HI> a small species of three-finned Cod<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Nov. Com. Petrop.</HI> xiv. 484. tab. xii. Its length does not exceed eleven inches.</NOTE>, to <HI>Petersburg,</HI> frozen, as <HI>Kola</HI> does Herrings in the same state.</P>
<P>The <HI>White Sea</HI> is every winter filled with ice from the Frozen ocean, which brings with it the Harp Seal, N<SUP>o</SUP> 77; and the Leporine, N<SUP>o</SUP> 75, frequent it during sum∣mer. Whoever surveys the maps of the provinces between this sea and the gulphs of <HI>Bothnia</HI> and <HI>Finland,</HI> will observe them to be more occupied by lakes than land, and be at once satisfied of the probability of the once-insulated state of <HI>Scandinavia.</HI> As soon as these streights were closed, the <HI>White Sea</HI> lost its depth, and is at present kept open only by the force of its great rivers.</P>
<P>On the eastern side of the entrance into the streight is the isle of <HI>Kandinos,</HI> often spoken of by our early navigators in their way to the <HI>Waygatz,</HI> in their search for a north-east passage. Between it and the main land is a very narrow channel. After doubling the cape of <HI>Kandinos,</HI> the sea forms two great bays. A considerable part of the shore to the east consists of low sandy hills<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Hackluyt, <HI>i. 277.</HI></NOTE>. Into the most remote bay flows, in lat. 68. 30, by many mouths, the vast river <HI>Peczora,</HI> a place of great trade before the time of <HI>Peter</HI> I. Thousands of <HI>Samoieds</HI> and other savages resorted to the town, with feathers of White Grous, and other birds; Sables, and the most valuable furs; skins of Elks and other deer; the oil from the Walrus, N<SUP>o</SUP> 71, from the Beluga, p. 182; and different sort of fish<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Purchas, <HI>i. 546.</HI></NOTE>. Here was, in 1611, a great fishery of <HI>Beluga:</HI> above fifty boats, with three men each, were employed to harpoon them<NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">The same, 549.</NOTE>. The entrance into the river is dangerous, by reason of a sandy shoal. The tide rises there only four feet.</P>
<P>The coasts east of <HI>Archangel,</HI> even as far as the river <HI>Ob,</HI> are inhabited by the <HI>Samoieds;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">SAMOIEDS.</NOTE> a race as short as the <HI>Laplanders,</HI> more ugly, and infinitely more brutalized; their food being the carcasses of horses, or any other animals.

<P>To the east of the <HI>Peczora</HI> commences the continent of

<P>BEYOND the <HI>Olenek,</HI> the vast <HI>Lena,</HI> which rises near lake <HI>Baikal,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">RIVER LENA.</NOTE> after a gentle and free course over a sandy or gravelly bottom, discharges itself by five great mouths, the eastern and western most remote from each other. The middle, or most northerly, is in lat. 73. 20. To form an idea of the size of this river, I must remark, that at <HI>Iakutsk,</HI> in lat. 61, twelve degrees from its discharge, the breadth is near three leagues<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Possibly</HI> Versts. <HI>See</HI> Voy. en Siberie, <HI>i. 407.</HI></NOTE>.

The last is the most easterly of the great rivers which fall into the <HI>Icy Sea.</HI> Beyond it is a woodless tract,<NOTE PLACE="marg">ARCTIC FLATS WOODLESS.</NOTE> which cuts off the Bea∣ver, the Squirrels, and many other animals to whom trees are essential in their oeco∣nomy.

<P>I shall now take a review of the vast extent of shore which borders on the <HI>Icy Sea.</HI> The <HI>Jouratzkaine</HI> coast, which lies between the <HI>Ob</HI> and the <HI>Jenesei,</HI> is high but not mountanous, and almost entirely composed of gravel or sand; but in many places there are low tracts. Not only on these, but on more elevated situations, are found great fragments of wood, and often entire trees, all of the same species; Fir, Larch, and Pine, green and fresh; in other places, elevated beyond the reach of the sea, are also great quantities of <HI>floated</HI> wood, antient, dried, and rotting<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Voy. en Siberie, <HI>ii. 27, 28.</HI></NOTE>. This is not the only proof of the loss of water in the <HI>Icy</HI> as well as other seas; for in these places is seen a species of clay, called by the <HI>Russians, Il,</HI> which is exactly like the kinds usually deposited by the water: and of this there is, in these parts, a bed about eight inches thick, which universally forms the upper stratum<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Same, ii. 362.</NOTE>.

the east, it grows mountanous, covered with stones, and full of coal. On the summit of the chain, to the east of <HI>Simovie Retchinoïe,</HI> is an amazing bed of small Mussels, of a species not observed in the subjacent sea. I think them brought there by sea-fowl, to eat at leisure; for it is not wonderful that numbers of objects of natural history should escape the eye in such a sea as this. Many parts again are low; but in most places the sea near the shore is rugged with pointed rocks. The coast about the bay of cape <HI>Tschutski,</HI> the most eastern extremity of <HI>Asia,</HI> is in some places rocky, in others sloping and verdant; but within land rising into a double ridge of high mountains.</P>

From the great headlands, there is at all times a fixed, rugged, and mountanous ice, which projects far into the sea. No sea is of so uncertain and dangerous navi∣gation: it is, in one part or other, always abundant in floating ice. During sum∣mer, the wind never blows hard twenty-four hours from the north, but every part of the shore is filled for a vast distance with ice; even the streights of <HI>Bering</HI> are obstructed with it<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">PALLAS: Also Narrative of four <HI>Russian</HI> sailors cast away on <HI>East Spitzbergen,</HI> 55.</NOTE>.

<P>I shall just mention some of the attempts made to pass through the <HI>Icy Sea</HI> to that of <HI>Kamtschatka.</HI> The first was in 1636, from the settlement of <HI>Yakutzk.</HI> The rivers from the <HI>Jana</HI> to the <HI>Kolyma</HI> were in consequence discovered.

<PB N="CI" REF="116"/>
but escaped to enjoy the honor of his discovery. Many other attempts were made, but the most which the adventurers have done was to get from the mouth of one great river to another in the course of a summer. I find very few names, ex∣cept of rivers, in a tract so vast as it is, on account of its being so little frequented. To the east of the promontory <HI>Taimura,</HI> that of <HI>St. Transfigurationis</HI> bounds the east side of the bay of <HI>Chatanga,</HI> in lat. 74. 40, long. from <HI>Ferro</HI> 125. <HI>Swaitoi-noss,</HI> or the <HI>Holy Cape,</HI> in lat. 73. 15, is a far-projecting headland, and, with the isles of the <HI>Lena,</HI> and another intervening headland, forms two vast bays. Out of the most eastern, into which the river <HI>Yana</HI> discharges itself, one <HI>Schalourof,</HI> a broken <HI>Russian</HI> merchant, took his departure for an eastern discovery. He began his voyage in <HI>July</HI> 1760 from the <HI>Lena,</HI> but was so obstructed with ice that he was forced into the <HI>Yana,</HI> where he was detained the whole winter, by the same cause, till <HI>July</HI> 29th, 1761. He doubled the <HI>Swaitoi-noss September</HI> the 6th; according to some, saw to the north a montanous land, possibly an island. He was eight days in getting through the passage between the continent and the isle of <HI>St. Diomede,</HI> which lies a little to the south-east of the <HI>Noss.</HI> He passed with a favorable wind the mouths of the <HI>Indigirka</HI> and <HI>Alazeia,</HI> and getting entangled among the ice between the <HI>Medviedkie Ostrova,</HI> or <HI>Bear Islands,</HI> was obliged to lay up his vessel in one of the mouths of the <HI>Kolyma</HI> during winter, where he subsisted on rein-deer, which frequented those parts in great herds during the severe season; and on various species of salmon and trout, which were pushing their way up the river before it was frozen. After this he made two other attempts. In the year 1763 he passed the <HI>Peszcanoi-noss,</HI> and got into a deep bay, called <HI>Tschaoûn Skaja Goûba,</HI> with the isle of <HI>Sabedei</HI> at its mouth; the great <HI>Schalatskoi-noss</HI> to the east; and at its bottom the little river <HI>Tschaoûn,</HI> which discharges itself here out of the land of the <HI>Tschutski,</HI> some of whom he saw on the shore, but they fled on his appearance. He found no means of subsisting in this bay, therefore was obliged to return to the <HI>Lena,</HI> and was greatly assisted in his passage by the strength of the current, which uni∣formly set from the east. In 1764 he made his last attempt, and was, as is conjectured, slain by the <HI>Tschutski;</HI> but whether he doubled the famous cape of that name, is left uncertain.

They found some small desart isles, without the lest appearance of land on the north; but on one they met with a sort of defence, formed of floating wood, on the side of a precipice, but by whom formed, or against what enemy, is hard to guess.

<P>To review the inhabitants of the <HI>Arctic</HI> coasts, I shall return as far as <HI>Fin∣mark.</HI> I refer the reader to p.

After them succeeds, to the east, a race of middle size; and, extraordinary to say, instead of degeneracy, a fine race of men is found in the <HI>Tschutski,</HI> in a climate equally severe, and in a country equally unproductive of the supports of life, as any part of these inhospitable regions. The manners of all are brutal, savage, and nearly animal; their loves the same; their living squalid and filthy beyond conception: yet on the site of some of these nations <HI>Mela</HI> hath placed the elegant <HI>Hyperborei:</HI> and our poet, <HI>Prior,</HI> giving free loose to his imagination, paints the manners of these <HI>Arctic</HI> people in the following beautiful fiction, after describing the condition of the natives of the torrid zone.</P>

<P>With greater reality speaks that just observer of nature, the naturalist's poet, of the inhabitants of this very country, as a true contrast to the foregoing lines:

<P>This amazing extent of the <HI>Asiatic Russian</HI> dominions remained undiscovered to a very late period. The <HI>Czars,</HI> immersed in sensuality, or engaged in wars, had neither taste or leisure to explore new countries. A plundering excursion was made into it in the reign of <HI>Basilovitz</HI> I; a second was made under his suc∣cessor: but a stranger, the celebrated <HI>Cossac, Yermac,</HI> driven from his country on the shores of the <HI>Caspian</HI> sea, pushed his way with a resolute band as far as <HI>Orel,</HI> near the head of the <HI>Kama,</HI> on the western side of the <HI>U<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>allian</HI> chain. There he met with one <HI>Strogonoff,</HI> a <HI>Russian</HI> merchant, recently settled in those parts for the sake of the traffic of furs. He continued in that neighborhood the whole winter, and was supplied by the <HI>Russians</HI> with all necessaries. In the spring he turned his arms against <HI>Kutchum Chan,</HI> one of the most powerful of the petty princes of the country which now forms part of the government of <HI>Tobolski.</HI> In 1581, he fought a decisive battle with the Chan, overthrew him, and seated himself on the throne. Finding his situation precarious, he ceded his conquests to <HI>Ba∣filovitz,</HI> who seized on the opportunity of adding this country to his dominions. He sent <HI>Yermac</HI> a supply of men. But at length his good fortune forsook him. He was surprized by the Chan; and, after performing all that a hero could do, perished in attempting to escape.</P>
<P><PB N="CVI" REF="121"/>The <HI>Russians,</HI> on the death of their ally, retired out of <HI>Sibiria;</HI> but they soon returned, recovered the conquests made by <HI>Yermac,</HI> and, before the middle of the following century, added to their antient possessions a territory fourteen hundred and seventy leagues in length, and near seven hundred in breadth (without in∣cluding the <HI>Russian</HI> colonies on the island of <HI>Oonalashka,</HI> on the coast of <HI>America</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">D'Auteroche, Voy. en Siberie, <HI>i. 83.</HI></NOTE>) yet is so thinly peopled, and with such barbarians, as to add no strength to the empire by any supplies to the army or navy. They are almost torpid with inaction; lazy to the highest degree, from their necessary confinement to their stoves during the long winter of the country. In that season, the ground is clad with deep snow, and the frost most tremendously severe. The spring, if so it may be called, is dis∣tinguished by the muddied torrents of melting snows, which rush from the moun∣tains, and give a sea-like appearance to the plains. Mists, and rain, and snow, are the variations of that season, and they continue even to the fourth of <HI>June.</HI> The short summer is hot, and favorable to vegetation. Corn may be seen a foot high by the 22d of <HI>June;</HI> and the grass is most luxuriant. Culinary plants will scarcely grow about <HI>Tobolski.</HI> Fruits of every kind, except a currant, are un∣known. A single crab-like apple, raised in a hot-house, was once produced there, sliced in a large dish, at a great entertainment, and served up with as much ostentation as we would in <HI>England</HI> a pine-apple.</P>
<P>The animals of <HI>Sibiria,</HI> the furs of which were the original object of its conquest, are now so reduced, that the <HI>Russians</HI> are obliged to have recourse to <HI>England</HI> for a supply from <HI>North America,</HI> which they add to their own stock of furs exported into <HI>China.</HI> Metals seem the staple trade of the country. Those of iron and copper are abundant and excellent. Gold and silver are found in several places, and in such abundance, as to form a most important article in the revenues of <HI>Russia.</HI> The copper mines of <HI>Kolyvan,</HI> from which those pretious metals are extracted, employ above forty thousand people, mostly colonists. The silver mines of <HI>Nertschinsk,</HI> beyond lake <HI>Baikal,</HI> above fourteen thousand. The whole revenue arising from the mines of different metals, is not less than £. 679, 182. 13 <HI>s.</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Coxe's Travels.</NOTE></P>

The Black Poplar, <HI>Populus nigra;</HI> the Common Sallow, <HI>Salix caprea;</HI> Sweet Willow, <HI>Salix pentandra;</HI> White Willow, <HI>Salix alba,</HI> are very frequent. The Hazel, <HI>Corylus Avellana,</HI> is circumstanced like the Oak. The Common Birch, <HI>Betula alba,</HI> is most abundant; and, as in all northern nations, of universal use. The Dwarf Birch, <HI>Betula nana,</HI> is confined to the neighborhood of lake <HI>Baikal.</HI> The Alder, <HI>Betula Alnus,</HI> is very frequent. The Pinaster, <HI>Pinus Pinea;</HI> the Pine with edible seeds, or <HI>Pinus Cembra;</HI> and Larch, <HI>Pinus Larix;</HI> all trees of the first use, medicinal or oecono∣mical, cover many parts of the country. The <HI>Norway</HI> Fir, <HI>Pinus Abies,</HI> and the Silver Fir, <HI>Pinus Picea,</HI> form, in most parts of the country, great forests: the first grows in this country not farther north than lat. 60; the last not higher than lat. 58; yet the former flourishes in <HI>Europe,</HI> and composes in <HI>Lapmark,</HI> far beyond the <HI>Arctic</HI> circle, woods of great extent: a proof of the superior rigour of cold in the <HI>Asiatic</HI> north. These form the sum of <HI>European</HI> trees growing in <HI>Sibiria.</HI> Of other plants, common to both continents, M. <HI>Gmelin</HI> gives the reader, in p. xciv. of his Preface, a slender list of such which fell under his observa∣tion.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">TSCHUTSKI.</NOTE>After the conquest of <HI>Sibiria,</HI> the <HI>Tschutski</HI> were the first people discovered by the <HI>Russians,</HI> who were indebted to the adventure of <HI>Deschnew</HI> for the knowlege of them. They are a free and brave race, and in size and figure superior to every neighboring nation; tall, stout, and finely made, and with long and agreeable countenances; a race insulated strangely by a lesser variety of men. They wore no beards. Their hair was black, and cut short, and covered either with a close cap, or hood large enough to cover the shoulders. Some hung beads in their ears, but none had the barbarism to bore either noses or lips. They wore a short and close frock, breeches, and short boots: some had trowsers. The materials of their cloathing was leather admirably dressed, either with or without the hair<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Voyage,</HI> ii. 450, tab. 51.</NOTE>. It is said that at times they wear jackets made of the intestines of whales<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Hist. Kamtschatka, <HI>Fr.</HI></NOTE>, like the <HI>Eskimaux;</HI> probably when they go to sea, for they excel their neighbors in fishing, and use open boats covered with skins<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Voyage, <HI>ii. 452.</HI></NOTE>, and like the women's boats of the <HI>Greenlanders.</HI> They have also the lesser or <HI>kajak.</HI> They make use of sledges, and have large fox-like dogs of different colors, with long soft woolly hair, which are probably designed for the draught. Some say that they use rein-deer, of which they have vast abundance, but neither milk them nor kill them for food, preferring the flesh of sea animals, except one dies by chance, or is killed by the wolves. They are a brave and warlike people; are armed with bows and arrows; the last pointed with stone or bone. They had spontoons headed with steel, pro∣cured by traffic from the <HI>Russians;</HI> these they usually slung over their right shoul∣der; and a leathern quiver of most elegant workmanship hung over the left<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">See tab. 51 of the <HI>Voyage.</HI></NOTE>. The <HI>Russians</HI> have often gained dear-bought victories over this brave people, but never were able to effect their conquest. They retained an high sense of liberty, and constantly refused to pay tribute; and the ambitious <HI>European</HI> miscalled them rebels. They will not on any consideration part with their weapons: possibly a <HI>Tschutski</HI> may think a disarmed man dishonored. Captain COOK, in his three hours visit to them, found their attachment to their arms, notwithstanding they willingly parted with any thing else, and even without the prospect of exchange. They treated him with great civility, but prudent caution: saluted him by bow∣ing
<PB N="CIX" REF="124"/>
and pulling off their caps, possibly a piece of politeness they learned from the <HI>Russians.</HI> They treated him with a song and dance, and parted friends; but not without a most remarkable and consequential event:—A year after the interview between Captain COOK and the <HI>Tschutski,</HI> a party of those people came to the frontier post of the <HI>Russians,</HI> and voluntarily offered friendship and tribute. These generous people, whom fear could not influence, were overcome by the civility and good conduct of our illustrious commander: they mistook him and his people for <HI>Russians,</HI> and, imagining that a change of behaviour had taken place, tendered to their invaders a lasting league<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Voy.</HI> iii. 217.</NOTE>. Possibly the munificent empress may blush at the obligation conferred by means of <HI>British</HI> subjects, in procuring to her empire a generous ally, at the instant her armed neutrality contributed to deprive us of millions of lawful subjects.</P>
<P>From the shortness of the interview little knowlege could be gained of their customs. I shall only observe, that they bury their dead under heaps of stones,<NOTE PLACE="marg">TUMULI.</NOTE> or carnedds: several were seen here with the rib of a whale on the top instead of a pillar<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ellis's Narrative, <HI>i. 332.</HI></NOTE>; a proof of the universality of these memorials of the dead.</P>
<P>The country of the <HI>Tschutski</HI> forms the most north-easterly part of <HI>Asia.</HI> It is a peninsula, bounded by the bay of <HI>Tchaoûn,</HI> by the <HI>Icy Sea,</HI> the streights of BERING, and the gulph and river of <HI>Anadir,</HI> which open into the sea of <HI>Kamtschatka.</HI> It is a mountanous tract, totally destitute of wood, and consequently of animals which re∣quire the shelter of forests. The promontory <HI>Schalotskoi,</HI> before mentioned, is the most westerly part. Whether it extends so far north as lat. 74, as the <HI>Russians</HI> place it, is very doubtful: there is the opinion of our great navigator against it. From his own reasonings he supposed that the tract from the <HI>Indigirska,</HI> eastward,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CORRECTIONS IN GEOGRAPHY BY CAPT. COOK.</NOTE> is laid down in the maps two degrees to the northward of its true position<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Voyage</HI> iii. 268.</NOTE>. From a map he had in his possession, and from information he received from the <HI>Russians,</HI> he places the mouth of the <HI>Kowyma,</HI> in lat. 68, instead of lat. 71. 20, as the <HI>Petersburg</HI> map makes it. It is therefore probable, that no part of <HI>Asia</HI> in this neighborhood extends further than lat. 70, in which we must place the <HI>Schalotskoi Noss;</HI> and after the example of Mr. <HI>Campbell,</HI> who formed his map of this country chiefly from the papers of Captain BERING<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">In <HI>Harris's Voy.</HI> ii. 1016.</NOTE>, give the land which lies to the east of that promontory a very southern trend. As Captain COOK had cause to imagine that the former charts erred in longitude as well as latitude, it is probable that he reached within sixty miles of the <HI>Schalotskoi Noss</HI><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><HI>Voyage</HI> iii. 270.</NOTE>. There we find him on <HI>August</HI> 29th, 1778, and from this period are enabled, from his remarks, to pro∣ceed securely accurate.</P>
<P><PB N="CX" REF="125"/>After crossing the <HI>Icy Sea</HI> from the most extreme part of the coast of <HI>America</HI> which he could attain, he fell in with land. It appeared low near the sea, and high inland; and between both lay a great lake. To a steep and rocky point, nearly in lat. 68. 56, and long. 180. 51, his <HI>ne plus ultra</HI> on the <HI>Asiatic</HI> side, he gave the name of <HI>Cape North;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">CAPE NORTH.</NOTE> beyond which he could not see any land, notwith∣standing the weather was pretty clear. The sea, at three miles distance from the shore, was only eight fathoms deep: this, with a rising wind, approaching fog, and apprehension of the coming down of the ice, obliging him to desist from farther attempts in these parts, he proceeded as near to the coast as he could with prudence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BURNEY'S ISLE.</NOTE> towards the south-east, and found it retain the same appearance. In lat. 67. 45, he discovered a small isle, about three leagues from the main, with steep and rocky shores, on which he bestowed the name of <HI>Burney,</HI> in honor of one of his officers; gratefully immortalizing the companions of his voyage, in this and other instances. After passing the island, the continent inland rose into mountains of considerable height, the termination of the great chain I before described.</P>
<P>In lat. 67. 3, long. 188. 11, he fell in with <HI>Serdze Kamen</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See tab. 84 of the <HI>Voyage.</HI></NOTE>,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERDZE KAMEN.</NOTE> a lofty promontory, faced towards the sea with a steep rocky cliff. To the eastward the coast continues high and bold, towards the <HI>North Cape</HI> low, being a continuation of the <HI>Arctic</HI> flats. This was the northern limit of the voyage of another illustrious navigator, Captain VITUS BERING,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CAPT. BERING.</NOTE> a <HI>Dane</HI> by birth, and employed on the same plan of discovery in these parts as our great countryman was in the late voyage. He was in the service of PETER the GREAT; who, by the strength of an extensive genius, conceiving an opinion of the vicinity of <HI>America</HI> to his <HI>Asiatic</HI> dominions, laid down a plan of discovery worthy of so extraordinary a monarch, but died before the attempt was begun; but his spirit survived in his successor. BERING, after a tedious and fatiguing journey through the wilds of <HI>Sibiria,</HI> arrived in <HI>Kamt∣schatka,</HI> attended with the scanty materials for his voyage, the greatest part of which he was obliged to bring with him through a thousand difficulties. Several of the circumstances of his adventures will be occasionally mentioned<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The account of the voyage is extremely worthy of perusal, and is preserved by the able Doctor <HI>Campbell,</HI> in <HI>Harris's Collection,</HI> ii. 1018.</NOTE>. I shall only say here, that he sailed from the river of <HI>Kamtschatka</HI> on <HI>July</HI> 15th, 1728; on the 15th of <HI>August</HI> saw <HI>Serdze Kamen,</HI> or the heart-shaped rock, a name be∣stowed on it by the first discoverer.</P>

far into the sea due east, and joined to the land by a long and very narrow isthmus, in lat. 66. 6.

An anonymous islet, imperfectly seen, and lying in lat. 64. 24, long. 190. 31, in mid-channel, com∣pletes the sum of those seen remote from land between the streights and the isle of St. <HI>Laurence.</HI> As to those named in the chart given by Lieut. <HI>Synd,</HI> who in 1764 made a voyage from <HI>Kamtschatka</HI> towards BERING'S Streights, they seem to exist only in imagination, notwithstanding the <HI>Russian</HI> calendar has been exhausted to find names for them. St. <HI>Agathon,</HI> St. <HI>Titus,</HI> St. <HI>Myron,</HI> and many others, fill the space passed over by Capt. COOK, and which could not have escaped the notice of his successor<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Caxe's Russian Discovery <HI>Map, p. 300.</HI>—Voy. <HI>iii. 503.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The land from BERING'S <HI>Tschutski Noss</HI> trends vastly to the west, and bounds on that side the vast gulph of <HI>Anadir,</HI> into the bottom of which the river of the same name empties itself; and limits the territory of the <HI>Tschutski.</HI></P>
<P>From thence is a large extent of coast trending south-west from Cape St. <HI>Thad∣deus,</HI> in lat. 62. 50, long. 180, the southern boundary of the gulph of <HI>Anadir,</HI> to <HI>Oljutorskoi Noss,</HI> beyond which the land retires full west, and forms in its bosom a gulph of the same name. Off <HI>Thaddeus Noss</HI> appeared, on <HI>June</HI> 29th, abundance of walruses and great seals; and even the wandering <HI>albatross</HI> was seen in this high latitude<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Voyage</HI> iii. 241.</NOTE>. Between this and the <HI>Penginsk</HI> gulph, at the end of the sea of <HI>Ochotsk,</HI> is the <HI>isthmus</HI> which unites the famous peninsula of <HI>Kamtschatka</HI> to the main land, and is here about a hundred and twenty miles broad, and extends in length from 52 to 61, north lat. The coasts are often low: often faced with cliffs, in many parts of an extraordinary height; and out at sea are rude and spiring rocks, the haunts of leonine seals, whose dreadful roarings are frequently the preservation of mariners, warning them of the danger, in the thick fogs of this climate<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Descr. Kamtsch. <HI>429.</HI></NOTE>. The coast has but few harbours, notwithstanding it juts frequently into great headlands. The most remarkable are, the <HI>North Head,</HI> with its needle rocks, at the entrance of the bay of <HI>Awatcha (Voyage,</HI> vol. iii. tab. 58); <HI>Cheepoonskoi Noss,</HI> still further north, engraven in vol. ii. tab. 84; and <HI>Kronotskoi Noss,</HI> with its lofty cliffs. The peninsula widens greatly in the middle, and lessens almost to a point at Cape <HI>Lopatka,</HI> which slopes into a low flat, and forms the southern ex∣tremity of the country. The whole is divided lengthways by a chain of lofty rocky mountains, frequently covered with snow, and shooting into conic summits,<NOTE PLACE="marg">VULCANOS.</NOTE> often smoking with vulcanic eruptions. They have broken out in numbers of places: the extinct are marked by the craters, or their broken tops. The vulcano near <HI>Awatcha</HI><NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">See tab. 85, <HI>Voyage,</HI> vol. iii.; and description of its eruption, p. 235.</NOTE>, that of <HI>Tolbatchick,</HI> and that of the mountain of <HI>Kamtschatka</HI><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Descr. Kamstchatka,</HI> tab. xv. p. 342.</NOTE>, are the modern. They burst out sometimes in whirlwinds of flames,
<PB N="CXIII" REF="128"/>
and burn up the neighboring forests: clouds of smoke succeed, and darken the whole atmosphere, till dispersed by showers of cinders and ashes, which cover the country for thirty miles round. Earthquakes, thunder, and lightning, join to fill the horror of the scenery at land; while at sea the waves rise to an uncommon height, and often divide so as to shew the very bottom of the great deep<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Descr. Kamtsch. Fr. <HI>340, 341.</HI></NOTE>. By an event of this kind was once exposed to sight the chain of submarine mountains which connected the <HI>Kuril</HI> isles to the end of this great peninsula. I do not learn that they overflow with lava or with water, like the vulcanos of <HI>Europe.</HI> There are in various parts of the country hot springs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">HOT SPRINGS.</NOTE> not inferior in warmth to those of <HI>Iceland</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Voyage</HI> iii. 206, 332.</NOTE>: like them they in some places form small <HI>jets d'eaux,</HI> with a great noise, but seldom exceed the height of a foot and a half<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Descr. Kamtsch. Fr.</HI> 348, and tab. iv. v. in which are given the course of the warm streams.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The climate during winter is uncommonly severe; for so low as <HI>Bolcheretsk,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">CLIMATE.</NOTE> lat. 52,30, all intercourse between neighbors is stopped. They dare not stir out for fear of being frost-bitten. Snow lies on the ground from six to eight feet thick as late as <HI>May;</HI> and the storms rage with uncommon impetuosity, owing to the subterraneous fires, the sulphureous exhalations, and general vulcanic dispo∣sition of the country. The prevaling winds are from the west, which passing over the frozen wilds of <HI>Sibiria</HI> and <HI>Tartary,</HI> add keenness and rigour to the winters of <HI>Kamtschatka.</HI> Winter continues till the middle of <HI>June:</HI> from that month to the middle of <HI>September</HI> may be called summer, if a season filled with rain, and mists, and ungenial skies, merits that name. Rye, barley, and oats, are committed to the earth, but seldom come to perfection. The subsistence of the <HI>Russians</HI> and <HI>Cossacks</HI> depends therefore on importation from <HI>Sibiria.</HI> In some parts grass grows to a great height, and hay of uncommon nutriment is harvested for the fattening of cattle<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot"><HI>Voy.</HI> iii. 327.</NOTE>. Grain is a luxury for the colonists only: the natives have other resources, the effects of necessity. Excepting in few places, this is a land of in∣corrigible barrenness. As soon as the sea otters and other pretious furs are ex∣hausted, <HI>Kamtschatka</HI> will be deserted by the <HI>Russians,</HI> unless they should think fit to colonize the continent of <HI>America,</HI> which the furs of that country, or the prospect of mineral wealth, may induce them to attempt.</P>
<P>Few ores have as yet been discovered in this peninsula:<NOTE PLACE="marg">ORES.</NOTE> not that it wants either copper or iron; but every necessary in those metals is imported at so cheap a rate, that it is not worth while for a people ignorant in mining and smelting to search for them in the almost inaccessible mountains.</P>
<P>From the climate and the barren nature of <HI>Kamtschatka,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">PLANTS.</NOTE> the reader need not be

surprized at the poverty of its <HI>Flora.</HI> It must not be supposed that the scanty enu∣meration of its plants arises from a neglect of search, or the want of a botanist to explore its vegetable kingdom. STELLER, a first-rate naturalist of <HI>Germany,</HI> who attended BERING in his last voyage, resided here a considerable time after his escape from that unfortunate expedition, expressly to complete his remarks in natural history. The result of his botanical researches was communicated to Doctor <HI>Gmelin,</HI> another gentleman sent by the <HI>Russian</HI> government to examine into the natural history of its dominions. <HI>Europe</HI> has from time to time been ransacked for men of abilities to perform this meritorious mission, and the fruits of their labors have been liberally communicated to a public thirsting for knowlege. The names of MULLER, GMELIN, STELLER, DE L'ISLE, KRASHANINICOFF, GUILDENSTAEDT, LEPECHIN, and PALLAS, will ever be held in respect, for adding to the stock of natural knowlege. But how much is it to be lamented that <HI>England</HI> wants a patron to encourage the translation of their works, locked up at present in <HI>Russian</HI> or <HI>German,</HI> concealed from the generality of readers, to the great sup∣pression of knowlege!</P>
<P>I here give a list of the plants of <HI>Kamtschatka</HI> in systematic order; and from it annex an account of the uses made of them by the natives of the peninsula. I must not omit my thanks to the Rev. Mr. <HI>Lightfoot,</HI> and the Rev. Mr. <HI>Hugh Davies</HI> of <HI>Beaumaris,</HI> for the great assistance I received from them. Let me premise, that the plants marked <HI>A.</HI> are common to <HI>America</HI> and <HI>Kamtschatka;</HI> with <HI>B.</HI> to BERING'S Isle; with <HI>E.</HI> to <HI>England</HI> or <HI>Scotland;</HI> and with <HI>Virg.</HI> those which extend to <HI>Virginia,</HI> or the eastern side of <HI>North America</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Taken from Doctor <HI>Forster's</HI> FLORA AMERICAE SEPTENTRIONALIS. It is highly probable that many, not noted as such, may be common to both sides of the continent, notwithstanding they escaped the notice of <HI>Steller</HI> or our navigators.</NOTE>. It is remarkable, that the <HI>European</HI> plants, which had deserted <HI>Sibiria</HI> about the <HI>Jenesei,</HI> appear here in great abundance.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">USES.</NOTE>The <HI>Kamtschatkans</HI> boast of their skill in the knowlege of the application of the vegetable kingdom to the uses of mankind. The <HI>Sibirians</HI> cure the venereal disease by a decoction of the root of the <HI>Iris Sibirica,</HI> which acts by purging and vomiting. They keep the patient eight days in a stove, and place him in a bed of the leaves
<PB N="CXVII" REF="132"/>
of the <HI>Arctium Lappa,</HI> or common Burdock, which they frequently change till the cure is effected.</P>
<P>The <HI>Heracleum Panaces,</HI> or <HI>Sweet grass,</HI> was a plant of the first use with the <HI>Kamts∣chatkans,</HI> and formerly made a principal ingredient in all their dishes; but so powerful does the love of hot liquors sway with the <HI>Russians,</HI> that, since their ar∣rival, it is entirely applied to distillation. The beginning of <HI>July</HI> the more suc∣culent stalks and leaves are gathered; after the down is scraped off with shells, they are layed to ferment; when they grow dry, they are placed in bags, and in a few days are covered with a saccharine powder: only a quarter of a pound of powder is collected from a pood, or thirty-six pounds of the plant, which tastes like liquorice. They draw the spirit from it by steeping bundles of it in hot water; then promote the fermentation in a small vessel, by adding the berries of the <HI>Lonicera Xylosteum,</HI> Sp. Pl. i. 248, and <HI>Vaccinium uliginosum,</HI> 499. They con∣tinue the process by pouring on more water, after drawing off the first: they then place the plants and liquor in a copper still, and draw off, in the common manner, a spirit equal in strength to brandy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Voyage,</HI> iii. 337.</NOTE>. Accident discovered this liquor. One year, the natives happening to collect a greater quantity of berries of several kinds, for winter provision, than usual, found in the spring that a great quantity had fermented, and become useless as a food. They resolved to try them as a drink, and mixed the juice with water. Others determined to experience it pure; and found, on trial, the <HI>Arctic</HI> beatitude, drunkenness<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Gmelin, Fl. Sib. <HI>i. 217.</HI></NOTE>. The <HI>Russians</HI> caught at the hint, introduced distillation, and thus are enabled to enjoy ebriety with the pro∣duction of the country.</P>
<P>The <HI>Moucho-more</HI> of the <HI>Russians,</HI> the <HI>Agaricus muscarius,</HI> Sp. Pl. 1640, is an∣other instrument of intoxication. It is a species of Toadstool, which the <HI>Kamts∣chadales</HI> and <HI>Koriaks</HI> sometimes eat dry, sometimes immersed in a fermented liquor made with the <HI>Epilobium,</HI> which they drink notwithstanding the dreadful effects. They are first seized with convulsions in all their limbs, then with a raving such as attends a burning fever; a thousand phantoms, gay or gloomy (according to their constitutions) present themselves to their imaginations: some dance; others are seized with unspeakable horrors. They personify this mush∣room; and, if its effects urge them to suicide, or any dreadful crime, they say they obey its commands. To fit themselves for premeditated assassinations, they take the <HI>Moucho-more.</HI> Such is the fascination of drunkenness in this country, that nothing can induce the natives to forbear this dreadful potion<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Hist. Kamtschatka, <HI>99, 100.</HI></NOTE>!</P>
<P><PB N="CXVIII" REF="133"/>As a food, the <HI>Saranne,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">SARANNE.</NOTE> or <HI>Lilium Kamtschatcense,</HI> is among the principal. Its roots are gathered by the women in <HI>August,</HI> dried in the sun, and layed up for use: they are the best bread of the country; and after being baked are reduced to powder, and serve instead of flour in soups and several dishes. They are sometimes washed, and eaten as potatoes; are extremely nourishing, and have a pleasant bitter taste. Our navigators boiled and eat them with their meat. The natives often parboil, and beat it up with several sorts of berries, so as to form of it a very agreeable confection. Providentially it is an universal plant here, and all the grounds bloom with its flower during the season<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Desc. Kamtsch. <HI>363.</HI></NOTE>. Another happiness re∣marked here is, that while fish are scarce, the <HI>Saranne</HI> is plentiful; and when there is a dearth of this, the rivers pour in their provisions in redoubled profusion. It is not to the labors of the females alone that the <HI>Kamtschatkans</HI> are indebted for these roots. The <HI>oeconomic Mouse,</HI> p. 134. A. saves them a great deal of trouble. The <HI>Saranne</HI> forms part of the winter provisions of that little animal: they not only gather them in the proper season, and lay them up in their ma∣gazines, but at times have the instinct of bringing them out, in sunny weather, to dry them, least they should decay<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>PALLAS,</HI> Nov. Sp. Mur. <HI>230.</HI></NOTE>. The natives search for their hoards; but with prudent tenderness leave part for the owners, being unwilling to suffer such useful caterers to perish.</P>
<P>Let me add, that STELLER enumerates other species of the Lilly genus, which I believe are edible. Every species of fruit, except berries, is denied to this un∣kind climate; but the inhabitants use various sorts of them as wholesome substi∣tutes, which they eat fresh, or make into palatable jams, or dress with their fish, either fresh or when preserved for winter use: such are those of the <HI>Lonicera Xylo∣steum</HI> or <HI>Gimolost,</HI> a sort of Honeysuckle: the <HI>Rubus Chamaemorus, Morochka,</HI> or Cloudberries: the <HI>Vaccinium Myrtillus, Uliginosum, Vitis Idaea,</HI> and <HI>Oxycoccos,</HI> or Bilberries, Marsh Bilberries, Red Bilberries, and Cranberries: the <HI>Empetrum Nigrum,</HI> or Heathberries: the <HI>Prunus Padus,</HI> or Bird Cherry: <HI>Crataegus Oxyacan∣tha,</HI> or White Thorn with red and with black berries: the <HI>Juniperus Communis,</HI> or Common Juniper: and finally, of those of the <HI>Sorbus Aucuparia,</HI> or Common Service.</P>
<P>Of the <HI>Epilobium Latifolium,</HI> Sp.

<P><PB N="CXIX" REF="134"/>The <HI>Polygonum Bistorta,</HI> Snake-weed, or <HI>Jikoum,</HI> is eaten fresh or dried, and often pounded with the <HI>Caviar.</HI> The <HI>Chaerophyllum Sylvestre,</HI> Wild Chervil, or Cow-weed, the <HI>Morkavai</HI> of the natives, is eaten green in the spring, or made into sour krout. The <HI>Solidago Itschitschu,</HI> Fl. Sib. ii. 170, is dried and boiled with fish; and the broth from it tastes as if the flesh of the <HI>Argali</HI> or wild sheep had been seethed in it. The root of <HI>Kotkonnia,</HI> a species of <HI>Tradescantia,</HI> is eaten either fresh, or used with the roes of fish: the berries have an agreable acidity, like an unripe apple, but will not keep, therefore they must be eaten as soon as they are gathered. <HI>Allium Ursinum, Tcheremcha,</HI> our Wild Garlic, is very common, and useful in medicine as well as food; both <HI>Russians</HI> and natives gather it in great quantities for winter service: they steep it in water, then mix it with cabbage, onions, and other ingredients, and form out of them a ragout, which they eat cold. It is also the principal remedy for the scurvy. As soon as this plant appears above the snow, they seem to put this dreadful disorder at defiance, and find a cure almost in its worst stages. The <HI>Potentilla fruticosa,</HI> Sp. Pl. i. 709, or Shrubby Cinquefoil, is very efficacious in the dysentery, or in fresh wounds. The <HI>Dryas pentapetala,</HI> Sp. Pl. i. 717, or <HI>Ichagban,</HI> is employed in swellings or pains of the limbs. That dreadful poison the <HI>Cicuta virosa,</HI> Sp. Pl. i. 366, Water Hemlock, the <HI>Omeg,</HI> is applied to use, by the bold practitioners of this country, in cases of pains in the back. They sweat the patient profusely, and then rub his back with the plant, avoid∣ing to touch the loins, which, they say, would bring on immediate death.</P>
<P>The trees of use are a dwarf species of <HI>Pinus Cembra,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">TREES.</NOTE> or Pine with edible kernels; it grows in great quantities on both the mountains and plains, covered with moss.

<P>The <HI>Pinus Larix,</HI> or Larch-tree, grows only on the river of <HI>Kamtschatka,</HI> and the streams which run into it.

Of the <HI>Betula alba,</HI> or Common Birch, a tree so useful to these northern nations, they make their sledges and canoes; and cut the fresh bark into small slices like vermicelli, and eat it with their dried caviar: they also tap the trees, and drink the liquor without any preparation. With the bark of the alder they dye their leather; but that, and every tree they have near the coast, is stunted, so that they are obliged to go far inland for timber of proper size.</P>
<P>I must add, as a vegetable of use in oeconomics, the <HI>Triticum,</HI> Gm.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">FISH.</NOTE>The fish of <HI>Kamtschatka</HI> are with difficulty enumerated.

<P>The Fin Whale,<NOTE PLACE="marg">WHALE.</NOTE> <HI>Br. Zool.</HI> iii. N<SUP>o</SUP> 18, is very frequent, and is of singular use to the inhabitants.

<P>But the fish of the first importance to the <HI>Kamtschatkans,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">SALMON.</NOTE> and on which they de∣pend for subsistence, are the anadromous kinds, or those which at stated seasons ascend the rivers and lakes out of the sea. These are entirely of the Salmon genus, with exception to the common Herring, which in autumn quits the salt water. It is sayed, that every species of Salmon is found here. I may with certainty adjoin, that several of the <HI>Sibirian</HI> species, with variety peculiar to this country, ascend the <HI>Kamtschatkan</HI> rivers in multitudes incredible. The inhabitants dignify some of their months by the names of the fish. One is called <HI>Kouiche,</HI> or the month of <HI>Red Fishes;</HI> another, <HI>Ajaba,</HI> or that of <HI>Little White Fish;</HI> a third, <HI>Kaiko,</HI> or of the fish <HI>Kaiko;</HI> and a fourth, <HI>Kijou,</HI> or the month of the <HI>Great White Fish</HI><NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Hist.

It is observable, that each shoal keeps apart from others of different species, and fre∣quently prefers a separate river, notwithstanding the mouths may be almost con∣tiguous. They often come up in such numbers as to force the water before them, and even to dam up the rivers, and make them overflow their banks; insomuch that, on the fall of the water, such multitudes are left on dry ground, as to make a stench capable of causing a pestilence, was it not fortunately dispersed by the violence of the winds; besides, the bears and dogs assist, by preying on them, to lessen the ill effects.</P>
<P><PB N="CXXIV" REF="139"/>Every species of Salmon dies in the same river or lake in which it is born, and to which it returns to spawn. In the third year, male and female consort together, and the latter deposits its spawn in a hole formed with its tail and fins in the sand; after which both sexes pine away, and cease to live. A fish of a year's growth continues near the place, guards the spawn, and returns to the sea with the new-born fry in <HI>November</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Descr. Kamtsch. <HI>471.</HI></NOTE>. The Salmons of this country spawn but once in their lives: those of <HI>Sibiria</HI> and <HI>Europe,</HI> the rivers of which are deep, and abound with insect food, are enabled to continue the first great command of nature during the period of their existence. In <HI>Kamtschatka</HI> the rivers are chilly, shallow, rapid, full of rocks, and destitute of nourishment for such multitudes: such therefore which cannot force their way to the neighborhood of the tepid streams, or get back to the sea in time, universally perish; but Providence has given such resources, in the spawners, that no difference in numbers is ever observed between the returning seasons. It is singular, that neither the lakes or rivers have any species of fish but what come from the sea. All the lakes (for this country abounds with them) communicate with the sea; but their en∣trance, as well as that of many of the rivers, is entirely barred up with sand brought by the tempestuous winds, which confine the fish most part of the winter, till they are released by the storms taking another direction.</P>

After it has been some time in the fresh water it changes its shape (the male especially) in a most surprizing manner. The jaws and teeth grow prodigiously long, especially the upper, which at first is shortest, but soon shoots beyond the under, and grows crooked downwards; the body becomes emaciated, and the meat bad: but what is most characteristic, an enormous bunch rises just before the first dorsal fin, to which it owes its name.

<P>The most singular is the <HI>Ouiki,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">OUIKI.</NOTE> or <HI>Salmo Catervarius</HI> of STELLER. It belongs to the <HI>Osmeri</HI> of LINNAEUS. Swims in immense shoals on the eastern coast of <HI>Kamts∣chatka,</HI> and the new-discovered islands, where it is often thrown up by the sea to the height of some feet, upon a large extent of shore: is excessively unwholesome as a food, and causes fluxes even in dogs. It never exceeds seven inches in length. Just above the side-line is a rough fascia, beset with minute pyramidal scales, standing upright, so as to appear like the pile of shag: their use is most curious— while they are swimming, and even when they are flung on shore, two, three, or even as many as ten, will adhere as if glued together, by means of this pile, inso∣much that if one is taken up, all the rest are taken up at the same time.</P>
<P>To conclude this list of <HI>Kamtschatkan</HI> Salmon, I must add the <HI>Salmo Thymallus,</HI> or Grayling; the <HI>S. Cylindraceus,</HI> before described; the <HI>Salmo Albula,</HI> Lin.

The natives catch them in summer in nets; and in winter in most amazing numbers, by breaking holes in the ice, into which they drop their nets, then cover the opening with mats, and leave a small hole for one of their companions to peep through, and observe the coming of the fish; when they draw up their booty: and string part on pack-thread for drying; and from the remainder they press an oil white as the butter of <HI>Finland</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Descr.

<P>The sea,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SEA.</NOTE> on which these people depend for their very existence, is finely adapted for the retreat and preservation of fish. It does not consist of a level uniform bottom, liable to be ruffled with storms, but of deep vallies and lofty
<PB N="CXXVIII" REF="143"/>
mountains, such as yield security and tranquillity to the finned inhabitants. We find the soundings to be most unequal: in some places only twenty-two fathoms, in others the lead has not found a bottom with a hundred and sixty fathoms of line. On such places the fish might rest undisturbed during the rage of the tempestuous winters. I do not find the least notice of shells be∣ing met with in these seas: either there are none, or they are pelagic, and escape the eyes of the navigators. But nature probably hath made ample pro∣vision for the inhabitants of the sea, in the quantity of sea-plants which it yields; STELLER, the great explorer of this region, enumerates the following, many of which are of uncommon elegance:

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">TIDES.</NOTE>In the harbours of Sts. <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>Paul</HI> the greatest rise of the tides was five feet eight inches at full and change of the moon, at thirty-six minutes past four, and they were very regular every twelve hours<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Voyage,</HI> iii. 323.</NOTE>. The <HI>Russian</HI> philosophers observed here a singular phaenomenon in the flux and reflux of the sea twice in the twenty-four hours, in which is one great flood and one small flood; the last of which is called <HI>Manikha.</HI> At certain times nothing but the water of the river is seen within its proper channel; at other times, in the time of ebb, the waters are observed to overflow their banks. In the <HI>Manikha,</HI> after an ebb of six hours, the water sinks about three feet, and the tide returns for three hours, but does not rise above a foot; a seven-hours ebb succeeds, which carries off the sea-water, and leaves the bay dry. Thus it happens three days before and

after the full moon; after which the great tide diminishes, and the <HI>Manikha,</HI> or little tide, increases<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Descr. Kamtsch. <HI>510.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The rivers of the country rise in the midst of the great chain of mountains, and flow on each side into the seas of <HI>Ochotsk,</HI> or that of <HI>Kamtsckatka.</HI> They fur∣nish a ready passage in boats or canoes (with the intervention of carrying-places) quite across the peninsula. As has been mentioned, the waters yield no fish of their own, but are the retreat of myriads of migrants from the neighboring seas.</P>
<P>This peninsula, and the country to the west,<NOTE PLACE="marg">NATIVES.</NOTE> are inhabited by two na∣tions; the northern parts by the <HI>Koriacs,</HI> who are divided into the Rein-deer or wandering, and the fixed <HI>Koriacs;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">KORIACS.</NOTE> and the southern part by the <HI>Kamts∣chatkans,</HI> properly so called: the first lead an erratic life,<NOTE PLACE="marg">WANDERING.</NOTE> in the tract bounded by the <HI>Penschinska</HI> sea to the south-east; the river <HI>Kowyma</HI> to the west; and the river <HI>Anadir</HI> to the north<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Hist. Kamtsch. <HI>136.</HI></NOTE>. They wander from place to place with their Rein-deer, in search of the moss, the food of those animals, their only wealth<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">See. p. 25 of this Work.</NOTE>. They are squalid, cruel, and warlike, the terror of the fixed <HI>Koriacs,</HI> as much as the <HI>Tschutski</HI> are of them. They never frequent the sea, nor live on fish. Their habitations are <HI>jourts,</HI> or places half sunk in the earth: they never use <HI>ba∣lagans,</HI> or summer-houses elevated on posts, like the <HI>Kamtschatkans:</HI> are in their persons lean, and very short: have small heads and black hair, which they shave frequently: their faces are oval: nose short: their eyes small: mouth large: beard black and pointed, but often eradicated.</P>
<P>The fixed <HI>Koriacs</HI> are likewise short, but rather taller than the others,<NOTE PLACE="marg">FIXED.</NOTE> and strongly made: they inhabit the north of the peninsula: the <HI>Anadir</HI> is also their boundary to the north; the ocean to the east; and the <HI>Kamtschatkans</HI> to the south. They have few Rein-deer, which they use in their sledges; but neither of the tribes of <HI>Koriacs</HI> are civilized enough to apply them to the purposes of the dairy. Each speak a different dialect of the same language; but the fixed in most things resemble the <HI>Kamtschatkans;</HI> and, like them, live almost entirely on fish. They are timid to a high degree, and behave to their wandering brethren with the utmost submission; who call them by a name which signifies <HI>their slaves.</HI> These poor people seem to have no alternative; for, by reason of the scarcity of Rein-deer, they depend on these tyrants for the essential article of cloathing. I cannot trace the origin of these two nations; but from the features may pronounce them offspring of <HI>Tartars,</HI> which have spread to the east, and degenerated in size and strength by the rigour of the climate, and often by scarcity of food.</P>

STELLER, to have been derived from the <HI>Mongalian Chinese,</HI> not only from a similarity in the termina∣tion of many of their words, but in the resemblance of their persons, which are short. Their complexion is swarthy: their beard small: their hair black: face broad and flat: eyes small and sunk: eye-brows thin: belly pendent: legs small— circumstances common to them and the <HI>Mongalians.</HI> It is conjectured, that in some very remote age they fled hither, to escape the yoke of the eastern conque∣rors, notwithstanding they believe themselves to be aboriginal, created and placed on the spot by their god <HI>Koutkou.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">RELIGION.</NOTE>In respect to their deity, they are perfect minute philosophers. They find fault with his dispensations; blaspheme and reproach him with having made too many mountains, precipices, breakers, shoals, and cataracts; with forming storms and rains; and when they are descending, in the winter, from their barren rocks, they load him with imprecations for the fatigue they undergo. In their morals they likewise bear a great similitude to numbers among the most polished rank in the <HI>European</HI> nations—they think nothing vitious that may be accomplished with∣out danger; and give full loose to every crime, provided it comes within the pale of security.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">GENII.</NOTE>They have also their lesser deities, or genii. Each of them have their peculiar charge; to these they pay considerable veneration, and make offerings to them, to divert their anger or ensure their protection. The <HI>Kamouli</HI> preside over the mountains, particularly the <HI>vulcanic;</HI> the <HI>Ouchakthou,</HI> over the woods; <HI>Mitg,</HI> over the sea; <HI>Gaetch,</HI> over the subterraneous world; and <HI>Fouila</HI> is the author of earthquakes. They believe that the world is eternal; that the soul is immortal; that in the world below it will be reunited to the body, and experience all the pains usual in its former state; but that it never will suffer hunger, but have every thing in great abundance: that the rich will become poor, and the poor rich; a sort of just dispensation, and balance of former good and evil<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Hist. Kamtsch. <HI>68, 71.</HI></NOTE>. But almost all these super∣stitions are vanished by the attention of the <HI>Russians</HI> to their conversion. There are few who have not embraced the Christian religion. Churches have been built, and schools erected, in which they are successfully taught the language of their conquerors, which has already almost worn out that of the native people.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">NUMBERS OF PEOPLE.</NOTE>The country was very populous at the arrival of the <HI>Russians;</HI> but, after a dread∣ful visitation of the small-pox, which in 1767 swept away twenty thousand
<PB N="CXXXI" REF="146"/>
souls<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Voyage,</HI> iii. 366.</NOTE>, at present there are not above three thousand who pay tribute, the inha∣bitants of the <HI>Kuril</HI> isles included. Here are about four hundred of the military <HI>Russians</HI> and <HI>Cossacks,</HI> besides a number of <HI>Russian</HI> traders and emigrants perpe∣tually pouring in, who intermix with the natives <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Same, 367.</NOTE> in marriage, and probably in time will extinguish the aboriginal race. The offspring is a great improvement; for it is remarked, that the breed is far more active than the pure <HI>Russian</HI> or <HI>Cossack.</HI> Sunk in lordly indolence, they leave all the work to the <HI>Kamtschatkans,</HI> or to their women; and suffer the penalty of their laziness, by the scurvy in its most frightful forms.</P>
<P>The <HI>Kamtschatkans</HI> seem to retain the antient form of their dress;<NOTE PLACE="marg">DRESS.</NOTE> but during summer it is composed of foreign materials; in the warm season both sexes use nankeen, linen, and silk; in winter, the skins of animals well dressed: the dress of men and women resembles a carter's frock with long sleeves, furred at the wrists, the bottom, and about the neck. On their head is a hood of fur, some∣times of the shaggy skin of a dog, and often of the elegant skin of the earless Marmot. Trousers, boots, and furred mittens, compose the rest. The habit of ceremony of a <HI>Toion</HI> or chieftain is very magnificent, and will cost a hundred and twenty rubels: in antient times it was hung over with the tails of animals, and his furred hood flowed over each shoulder, with the respectability of a full-bottomed perriwig in the days of <HI>Charles</HI> II. The figure given in the <HI>History of Kamtschatka,</HI> translated into <HI>French,</HI> exhibits a great man in all his pride of dress<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Hist. Kamtschatka,</HI> tab. vi.—It differs much from the habit of ceremony described by Captain KING, iii. 377.</NOTE>; but so rapidly has the present race of natives copied the <HI>Russians,</HI> that possibly in so short a space as half a century, this habit, as well as numbers of other articles and customs, may be ranked among the antiquities of the country.</P>
<P>Bows and arrows are now quite disused.<NOTE PLACE="marg">ARMS.</NOTE> Formerly they used bows made of larch-wood, covered with the bark of the birch. The arrows were headed with stone or bone, and their lances with the same materials. Their armour was either mats, or formed of thongs cut out of the skins of Seals, and sewed toge∣ther, so as to make a pliable cuirass; which they fixed on their left side; a board defended their breast, and a high one on their back defended both that and the head.</P>
<P>Their savage and beastly hospitality is among the obsolete customs.<NOTE PLACE="marg">HOSPITALITY.</NOTE> Former∣ly, as a mark of respect to a guest, the host set before him as much food as would serve ten people. Both were stripped naked: the host politely touched no∣thing, but compelled his friend to devour what was set before him, till he was
<PB N="CXXXII" REF="147"/>
quite gorged; and at the same time heated the place, by incessantly pouring water on hot stones, till it became unsupportable. When the guest was crammed up to the throat, the generous landlord, on his knees, stuffed into his mouth a great slice of whale's fat, cut off what hung out, and cried, in a surly tone, <HI>Tana,</HI> or <HI>There!</HI> by which he fully discharged his duty; and, between heat and cramming, obliged the poor guest to cry for mercy, and a release from the heat, and the danger of being choaked with the noble welcome: oftentimes he was obliged to purchase his dis∣mission with most costly presents; but was sure to retaliate on the first oppor∣tunity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hist.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">DWELLINGS.</NOTE>From the birds they learned the art of building their <HI>balagans</HI> or summer-houses.

In this they live gregariously, to the number of six families in each; in a state in∣tolerable to an <HI>European,</HI> by reason of smoke, heat, and stench, from their store of dried or putrid fish, and from their laziness, in never going out to perform their offerings to <HI>Cloacina</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ellis's Nar. <HI>ii. 217.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>Instigated by avarice, the <HI>Russians</HI> made a conquest of this savage country; and found their account in it, from the great value of its furry productions. They have added to their dominions this extremity of <HI>Asia,</HI> distant at least four thousand miles from their capital.<NOTE PLACE="marg">ROADS TO KAMTS∣CHATKA.</NOTE> The journey to it is still attended with great difficulties, through wild and barren regions, over dreadful mountains; and possibly impracticable, but for the multitude of <HI>Sibirian</HI> rivers, which, with short intervals of land, facilitate the passage. Travellers usually take their de∣parture out of <HI>Sibiria</HI> from <HI>Jakutz,</HI> on the river <HI>Lena,</HI> in lat. 62: they go either by water along the river, to its conflux with the <HI>Aldun,</HI> along the <HI>Aldun</HI> to the <HI>Mai,</HI> and from that river up the <HI>Judoma;</HI> and from near the head of that river to <HI>Ochotsk,</HI> the port from whence they embark, and cross the sea of <HI>Ochotsk</HI> to <HI>Bolschaia-reka,</HI> the port of the western side of <HI>Kamtschatka.</HI> The whole journey usually takes up the short summer: that over the hills to <HI>Ochotsk</HI> (and which is most convenient) was performed by STELLER in thirty-four days, excluding seven of rest<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Descr.

<P>The <HI>Russians</HI> soon annexed these islands to their conquests. The sea abound∣ed with Sea Otters, and the land with Bears and Foxes; and some of them sheltered the Sable. Temptations sufficient for the <HI>Russians</HI> to invade these islands; but the rage after the furs of the Sea Otters has been so great, that they are become extremely scarce, both here and in <HI>Kamtschatka.</HI></P>
<P>The islands which lie to the east of that peninsula, and form a chain be∣tween it and <HI>America,</HI> must now engage our attention. They lie in the form of a crescent, and are divided into three groupes; the <HI>Aleutian,</HI> the <HI>Andreanoffskie,</HI> and the <HI>Fox</HI> isles: but mention must first be made of BERING'S isle, and that of <HI>Mednoi,</HI> and one or two small and of little note. These lie about two hundred and fifty versts to the east of the mouth of <HI>Kamtschatka</HI> river.<NOTE PLACE="marg">BERING'S ISLE.</NOTE> BERING'S is in lat. 55, where that great seaman was shipwrecked in <HI>November</HI> 1741, on his return from his <HI>American</HI> discoveries; and, after enduring great hardships, perished misera∣bly. Numbers of his people died of the scurvy, with all the dreadful symptoms at∣tendant on those who perished by the same disease in Lord <HI>Anson</HI>'s voyage<NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Book i. ch. x. and <HI>Decouvertes,</HI> &amp;c. ii. 293.</NOTE>; the survivors, among whom was the philosopher STELLER, reached <HI>Kamtschatka</HI> in <HI>August</HI> 1742, in a vessel constructed out of the wreck of their ship. The isle is about seventy or eighty versts long; consists of high granitical mountains, craggy with rocks and peaks, changing into free-stone towards the promontories. All the vallies run from north to south: hills of sand, formed by inundations of the sea, floated wood, and skeletons of marine animals, are found at great distances from the shore, at thirty fathoms perpendicular height above the high-water level; which serve as a monument of the violent inundations that the vulcanoes before mentioned
<PB N="CXXXIV" REF="149"/>
produce in these seas. Farther, the effect of the meteoric waters, and of the frosts, causes the rocks very sensibly to shiver and fall down, and precipitates every year some great mass into the sea, and changes the form of the island. The others are in the same case; so nothing is more probable than their gradual diminution, and, by consequence, the more easy communication formerly from one continent to the other, before the injuries of time, the effects of vulcanoes, and other catastrophes, had insensibly diminished the size, and perhaps the number of these isles, which form the chain; and had eaten in the coasts of <HI>Asia,</HI> which every where exhibit traces of the ravages they have undergone<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I am indebted to Doctor PALLAS for the whole account of this chain of islands, except where I make other references.—My extracts are made from a <HI>French</HI> Memoir, drawn up by my learned friend, and communicated to me.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The island swarmed with Sea Otters, which disappeared in <HI>March.</HI> The Ursine Seal succeeded them in vast numbers, and quitted the coast the latter end of <HI>May.</HI> The <HI>Leonine</HI> Seal, the <HI>Lachtach</HI> or Great Seal, and the <HI>Manati,</HI> abounded, and proved the support of the wrecked during their stay. <HI>Arctic</HI> Foxes were seen in great multitudes, and completed the list of Quadrupeds. The same species of water-fowl haunt the rocks, and the same species of fish ascend the rivers, as do in <HI>Kamtschatka.</HI> The tides rise here seven or eight feet. The bottom of the sea is rocky, correspondent with the island.</P>
<P>The few plants of this island, which have not been discovered in <HI>Kamtschatka,</HI> are as follow:

A great quantity of native copper is found at the foot of a ridge of calcareous mountains on the eastern side, and may be gathered on the shores in vast masses, which seems originally to have been melted by subterraneous fires. This island is full of hillocks, bearing all the appearance of vulcanic spiracles; which makes it pro∣bable, that these islands were rent from the continent by the violence of an earth∣quake.

Among the float-wood off this island is camphor, and another sweet wood, driven by the currents from the isle of <HI>Japan.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Aleutian</HI> group lies in the bend of the crescent,<NOTE PLACE="marg">ALEUTIAN ISLES. THE NEAREST.</NOTE> nearly in mid-channel be∣tween <HI>Asia</HI> and <HI>America,</HI> lat. 52. 30, and about two hundred versts distant from <HI>Mednoi.</HI> It consists of <HI>Attok, Schemija,</HI> and <HI>Semitchi.</HI> The first seems to sur∣pass in size <HI>Bering's</HI> isle; but resembles it in its component parts, as do the other two. <HI>Attok</HI> seems to be the island which <HI>Bering</HI> called <HI>Mount St. John.</HI> These are inhabited by a people who speak a language different from the northern <HI>Asiatics;</HI> they seem emigrants or colonists from <HI>America,</HI> using a dialect of the neighboring continent. They were discovered in 1745, by <HI>Michael Nevodtsikoff,</HI> a native of <HI>Tobolski,</HI> who made a voyage, at the expence of certain merchants, in search of furs, the great object of these navigations, and the leading cause of discoveries in this sea. This voyage was marked with horrid barbarities on the poor natives. The marine animals must have swarmed about this period, and for some time after. Mention is made of adventurers who brought from hence to <HI>Kamtschatka</HI> the skins of 1,872 Sea Otters, 940 females, and 715 cubs. Another, on a small adjacent isle, killed 700 old, and 120 cub Sea Otters, 1,900 blue Foxes, 5,700 black Ursine Seals, and 1,310 of their cubs<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Coxe's Russ. Disc.</NOTE>. The blue Foxes abound in these islands, brought here on floating ice, and multiply greatly. The blue variety is ten times more numerous here than the white; but the reverse is ob∣served in <HI>Sibiria.</HI> They feed on fish, or any carrion left by the tide. The natives bore their under lips, and insert in them teeth cut out of the bones of the Walrus; and they use boats covered with the skins of sea animals.</P>
<P>At a great distance from the first group is the second, or farthest <HI>Aleutian</HI> isles:<NOTE PLACE="marg">ALEUTIAN ISLES. THE FARTHEST.</NOTE> of those we know no more than that the natives resemble those of the first. By the vast space of sea which Doctor PALLAS allows between the two groups, Captain COOK is fully vindicated for omitting, in his chart, the multitude of islands which, in the <HI>Russian</HI> maps, form almost a complete chain from BERING'S isle to <HI>America.</HI> Dr. PALLAS'S information must have been of the best kind; and he and our illustrious navigator coincide in opinion, that they have been needlessly multiplied, by the mistake of the <HI>Russian</HI> adventurers in the reckoning, or, on seeing the same island in different points of view, putting it down as a new discovery, and imposing on it a new name. The <HI>Andreanoffskie,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">ANDREAN ISLES.</NOTE> so called from their discoverer (in 1761) <HI>Andrean Tolstyk,</HI> succeed. On two of them are vulcanoes. Eastly, are the <HI>Fox</HI> islands, so called from the number of black, grey,<NOTE PLACE="marg">FOX ISLES.</NOTE> and red Foxes found on them; the skins of which are so coarse, as to be of little

value. The natives bore their noses and under lips, and insert bones in them by way of ornament. Among the last in this group is <HI>Oonolascha,</HI> which was visited by Captain COOK. This lies so near to the coast of <HI>America,</HI> as to clame a right to be considered as an appurtenance to it.

The natives, the most in∣nocent of people, are in a state of paradisaical nature, or at lest were so before the arrival of the <HI>European</HI> colonists among them. The men went nearly naked, without the consciousness of being so. The head is the only part they pay any attention to; and that is surrounded with a chaplet of net-work, ornamented with feathers, fruits, or mother of pearl. The women have a neat matted apron falling to their knees: they fling over their shoulders the skin of some beast, or of some large bird, and wear a head-dress like the other sex. The weapons of the country are bows, arrows, javelins, and bearded darts, calculated either for war or the chace. In the art of navigation, they have not got beyond the bark-log, made of a few bodies of trees bound parallel together; and in these they dare the turbulent element. They have no houses. During summer they shelter themselves from the sun under the shade of trees; and during nights sleep under a roof of branches spread over them. In winter they burrow under ground, and lodge as simply as the beasts themselves: such however was their condition in 1697; I have not been able to learn the effect of <HI>European</HI> refinement on their manners. Numbers of settlements have, since that time, been formed there, under the auspices of the Jesuits. The Order was of late years supported by the Marquis <HI>de Valero,</HI> a patriotic and munificent nobleman<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">This is the nobleman whom the writer of Lord <HI>Anson</HI>'s Voyage stigmatises with the epithet of <HI>munificent bigot.</HI> It was not by a reverend author, as is generally supposed, but by a person whose principles were unhappily in the extreme of another tincture.—Having from my youth been honored with the friendship of the <HI>Anson</HI> family, I can give a little history of the compilation of the Voyage:—A Mr. <HI>Paman</HI> first undertook the work. It was afterwards taken out of his hands, and placed in those of the reverend Mr. <HI>Walters,</HI> chaplain of the <HI>Centurion;</HI> but he had no share in it, farther than collecting the materials from the several journals: those were delivered to Mr. <HI>Benjamin Robins,</HI> a most able mathematician, and the most elegant writer of his time. He was son of a quaker-taylor at <HI>Bath,</HI> whom I have often seen: a most venerable and respectable old man. Mr. <HI>Robins</HI> unfortu∣nately forgot that he was writing in the character of a divine; and it was not thought proper to affront Mr. <HI>Walters,</HI> by omitting his name in the title-page, as he had taken in subscriptions: this, therefore, will account for the constant omission of the word <HI>Providence,</HI> in a voyage which abounded with such signal deliverances.</NOTE>, who favored their attempts, in order to extend the power and wealth of the <HI>Spanish</HI>

<P>The natives are a fine race of men, tall, brawny, and well made;<NOTE PLACE="marg">NATIVES.</NOTE> with black hair hanging over their shoulders, and with copper-colored skins. We have a most imperfect account of the animals of this peninsula. It certainly possesses two wool-bearing quadrupeds.

<P>This country was discovered under the auspices of the great <HI>Cortez,</HI> and Don <HI>Antonio de Mendoça,</HI> cotemporary viceroy of the new conquests: each, actuated by a glorious spirit of emulation, sent out commanders to advance the welfare of their country to the utmost; and <HI>Francisco Ulloa,</HI> in 1539, and <HI>Fernando Alarchon,</HI> in 1540, soon discovered this peninsula, and other adjacent regions, sources of im∣mense wealth to their country<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A full account of these voyages may be seen in <HI>Hackluyt,</HI> iii. 397, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE>.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">CAPTAIN COOK.</NOTE>Exactly two hundred years from that time the coast was again visited by an <HI>Englishman,</HI> who in point of abilities, spirit, and perseverance, may be compared with the greatest seaman our island ever produced. Captain JAMES COOK, on <HI>March</HI> 7th 1778, got sight of <HI>New Albion,</HI> in lat. 44. 33 north, and long. 235. 20 east, about eight leagues distant. The sea is here (as is the case the whole way from <HI>California</HI>) from seventy-three to ninety fathoms deep. The land is mode∣rately high, diversified with hills and vallies, and every where covered with wood, even to the water's edge. To the most southern cape he saw he gave the name of Cape <HI>Gregory,</HI> its latitude 43. 30: the next, which was in 44. 6, he called Cape <HI>Perpetua;</HI> and the first land he saw, which was in 44. 55, Cape <HI>Foul-weather.</HI> The whole coast, for a great extent, is nearly similar, almost strait, and harborless, with a white beach forming the shore. While he was plying off the coast, he had a sight of land in about lat. 43. 10, nearly in the situation of Cape <HI>Blanco de St. Sebastian,</HI> discovered by <HI>Martin d' Aguilar</HI> in 1603. A little to the north, the <HI>Oregon,</HI> or great river of the <HI>West,</HI> discharges itself into the <HI>Pacific Ocean.</HI> Its banks were covered with trees; but the vio∣lence of the currents prevented <HI>D'Aguilar</HI> from entering into it<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Hist.

<P><PB N="CXXXIX" REF="154"/>This exalted situation is part of the <HI>Shining Mountains,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAIN OF ALPS IN AMERICA.</NOTE> which are branches of the vast chain which pervades the whole continent of <HI>America.</HI> It may be fairly taken from the southern extremity, where <HI>Staten Land</HI> and <HI>Terra del Fuego</HI> rise out of the sea, as insulated links, to an immense height, black, rocky, and mark∣ed with rugged spiry tops, frequently covered with snow. <HI>New Georgia</HI> may be added, as another, horribly congenial, rising detached farther to the east. The mountains about the streights of <HI>Magellan</HI> soar to an amazing height, and infi∣nitely superior to those of the northern hemisphere, under the same degree of la∣titude. From the north side of the streights of <HI>Magellan,</HI> they form a continued chain through the kingdoms of <HI>Chili</HI> and <HI>Peru,</HI> preserving a course not remote from the <HI>Pacific Ocean.</HI> The summits, in many places, are the highest in the world. There are not less than twelve which are from two thousand four hun∣dred toises high, to above three thousand. <HI>Pichincha,</HI> which impends over <HI>Quito,</HI> is about thirty-five leagues from the sea, and its summit is two thousand four hundred and thirty toises above the surface of the water; <HI>Cayambé,</HI> imme∣diately under the equator, is above three thousand; and <HI>Chimborazo</HI> higher than the last by two hundred. Most of them have been vulcanic, and in different ages marked with eruptions far more horrible than have been known in other quarters of the globe. They extend from the equator, through <HI>Chili;</HI> in which kingdom is a range of vulcanoes, from lat. 26 south, to 45. 30<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ovalli, Hist.

inconsiderable space between it and the <HI>Pacific Ocean;</HI> and frequently detached branches jut into the sea, and form promontories; which, with parts of the chain itself, were often seen by our navigators in the course of their voyage. Some branches, as we have before observed, extend towards the east, but not to any great distance. A plain, rich in woods and savannas, swarming with Bisons or Buffaloes, Stags, and <HI>Virginian</HI> Deer, with Bears, and great variety of game, occupies an amazing tract, from the great lakes of <HI>Canada,</HI> as low as the gulph of <HI>Mexico;</HI> and eastward to the other great chain of mountains, the <HI>Apalachian,</HI> which are the <HI>Alps</HI> of that side of northern <HI>America.</HI> I imagine its commencement to be about lake <HI>Champlain</HI> and lake <HI>George,</HI> with branches pointing obliquely to the river <HI>St. Laurence</HI> eastward, and rising on its opposite coasts: others extending, with lowering progress, even into our poor remnant of the new world, <HI>Nova Scotio.</HI> The main chain passes through the province of <HI>New York,</HI> where it is distinguish∣ed by the name of the <HI>Highlands,</HI> and lies within forty miles of the <HI>Atlantic.</HI> From thence it recedes from the sea, in proportion as it advances southward; and near its extremity in <HI>South Carolina</HI> is three hundred miles distant from the water. It consists of several parallel ridges<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Doctor <HI>Garden.</HI> See also Mr. <HI>Lewis Evans</HI>'s Essays and map. <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> 2d ed. p. 6, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE>, divided by most enchanting vallies, and generally cloathed with variety of woods. These ridges rise gradually from the east one above the other, to the central; from which they gradually fall to the west, into the vast plains of the <HI>Missisipi.</HI> The middle ridge is of an enormous bulk and height. The whole extends in breadth about seventy miles; and in many places leaves great chasms for the discharge of the vast and numerous rivers which rise in the bosoms of the mountains, and empty themselves into the <HI>Atlantic</HI> ocean, after yielding a matchless navigation to the provinces they water. In p. XCV, I have given a view of the immense elevated plain in the <HI>Russian</HI> em∣pire.

<P>Much of the low grounds between the base of the <HI>Apalachian</HI> hills and the sea (especially in <HI>Virginia</HI> and <HI>Carolina)</HI> have in early times been occupied by the ocean. In many parts there are numbers of small risings, composed of shells, and in all the plains incredible quantities beneath the surface. Near the <HI>Missisipi</HI> again, in lat. 32. 28, from the depth of fifty to eighty feet, are always found, in digging, sea-sand and sea-shells, exactly similar to what are met with on the shores near <HI>Pensacola</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">J. Lorimer, <HI><ABBR>esq</ABBR></HI></NOTE>. This is covered with a stratum of deep clay or marle, and above that with a bed of rich vegetable earth. All this proves the propriety of applying the epithet of NEW to this quarter of the globe, in a sense different to that intended by the novelty of its discovery. Great part of <HI>North America</HI> at lest became but recently habitable: the vast plains of the <HI>Missisipi,</HI> and the tract between the <HI>Apalachian Alps</HI> and the <HI>Atlantic,</HI> were once possessed by the ocean. Either at this period <HI>America</HI> had not received its population from the old world, or its inhabitants must have been confined to the mountains and their vallies, till the waters ceased to cover the tracts now peopled by millions.</P>
<P>The composition of the northern mountains agrees much with those of the north of <HI>Asia,</HI> and often consists of a grey rock stone or granite,<NOTE PLACE="marg">COMPONENT PARTS.</NOTE> mixed with glimmer and quartz; the first usually black, the last purplish. Near the river <HI>St. Lau∣rence,</HI> a great part of the mountains rests on a kind of slaty limestone. Large beds of limestones, of different colors, are seen running from the granitical mountains, and are filled with <HI>Cornua Ammonis,</HI> and different sorts of shells, par∣ticularly with a small species of scallop, together with various sorts of corals, branched as well as starry.

<P>Captain COOK continued his voyage to the northward; but, by reason of squally weather and fogs for a few degrees, or from lat. 50 to 55. 20, was deprived

<P>The trees were the <HI>Pinus Canadensis,</HI> or <HI>Canada</HI> Pine; the <HI>P.

<P>I have described, to the best of my power, the quadrupeds and birds of the <HI>Ame∣rican</HI> part of this voyage.

Woollen garments are very common among the people of this Sound, and are manufactured by the women. The materials of many of them seem taken from the Fox and the Lynx; others, I presume, from the exquisite down of the Musk Ox, N<SUP>o</SUP> 2. The only peculiar animal of these parts is the Sea Otter, N<SUP>o</SUP> 36: it extends southward along the coast, as far as lat. 49, and as high as 60<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">In p. 89, for lat. 44, read 49.</NOTE>.

<P>I may mention, that small Perroquets, and Parrots with red bills, feet, and breasts, were seen by M. <HI>Maurelle</HI> about Port <HI>Trinidada,</HI> in lat. 41. 7; and great flocks of Pigeons in the same neighborhood<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> Barrington's Miscell. <HI>489, 502.</HI></NOTE>.

<P>The inhabitants of this Sound alter in their appearance from those who live more southern.

brass, or copper: eyes small, black, languishing: mouth round: lips large and thick: hair of the head thick, strong, black, long, and lank; that on the eye∣brows very thin: neck short and thick: limbs small and ill-made: skin a pallid white, where it can be viewed free from dirt or paint. The women are nearly of the same form and size as the men, but undistinguishable by any feminine soft∣ness. Many of the old men have great beards, and even mustachios; but the younger people in general seem to have plucked out the hair, except a little on the end of the chin.</P>
<P>Their dress consists of mantles and cloaks, well manufactured among themselves, and either woollen, matting, or some material correspondent to hemp. Over their other cloaths the men frequently throw the skin of some wild beast, which serves as a great cloak. The head is covered with a cap made of matting, in form of a truncated cone, or in that of a flower-vase, with the top adorned with a pointed or round knob, or with a bunch of leathern tassels. Their whole bodies are incrusted with paint or dirt, and they are a most squallid offensive race; silent, phlegmatic, and uncommonly lazy; easily provoked to violent anger, and as soon appeased.

Mr. <HI>Bartram</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Travels, <HI>43.</HI></NOTE> proves that these masques extend to the eastern side of the continent, and that their use was sportive; for he was plagued part of a night with the buffoonery of a fellow, who came into his lodgings while he was on his travels, and, after playing a thousand antic tricks, vanished in a manner as if he meant to be taken for a hobgoblin.

<P>These people have made some progress in the imitative arts; for, besides their skill in the sculpture of their masques, which they cut into the shape of the heads of various species of beasts and birds, they are capable of painting with tolerable exactness: accordingly, they often represent on their caps the whole progress of the Whale-fishery. I have seen a small bow made of bone, which was brought by the navigators from this side of <HI>North America,</HI> on which was engraven, very intel∣ligibly, every object of the chace.

in abundance as articles of commerce. The skin of the head of the male leonine Seal was also offered to sale: in the Voyage it is called the <HI>Ursine;</HI> but from the great shagginess of the hair I presume I am not wrong in my conjecture.

Many of the women were distinguishable from the men by the delicacy of their features, which was far from the case with those of <HI>Nootka.</HI></P>
<P>In these parts, within the distance of ten degrees, is a change of both dress and manners. The cloak and mantle are here changed for a close habit, made of the skins of different beasts, usually with the hair outwards; or of the skins of birds, with only the down remaining; some with a cape, others with a hood: over which, in rainy weather, is worn a garment like a carter's frock, with large sleeves, and tight round the neck, made of the intestines probably of the whale, and as fine as gold-beater's leaf. On the hands are always worn mittens, made of the paws of a bear; and the legs are covered with hose, reaching to midway the thigh. The head is generally bare; but those who wear any thing, use the high truncated conic bonnet, like the people of <HI>Nootka</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Voyage,</HI> ii. 368, 369.</NOTE>.

<P>I leave the reader to amuse himself in the Voyage, by the account of the strange custom of the natives in cutting through their under lip, and giving themselves the monstrous appearance of two mouths<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Same, 369, tab. 46, 47.</NOTE>: in the orifice they place a bit of bone or shell by way of ornament. This custom extends to the distant <HI>Mosquitos,</HI> and even to the Brasilians<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Dampier, <HI>i. 32,</HI> de Bry.

These paint their faces, and puncture or tattow their chins. They are most remarkably clean in their food, and in their manner of eating it, and even in the keeping of their bowls and vessels.

<P>From <HI>Prince William's</HI> found the land trends north-west, and terminates in two headlands, called Cape <HI>Elizabeth</HI> and Cape <HI>Bede;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">CAPT BEDE.</NOTE> these, with Cape <HI>Banks</HI> on the opposite shore, form the entrance into the vast estuary of COOK'S river; in the midst of which are the naked isles, distinguished by the name of the <HI>Barren.</HI> Within, to the west, is a lofty two-headed mountain, called Cape <HI>Douglas;</HI> which is part of a chain of a vast height, in which was a vulcano, at the time this place was visited, emitting white smoke: and in the bottom of a bay, opposite to it, is an island, formed of a lofty mountain, on which was bestowed the name of Mount St. <HI>Augustine</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See the chart, ii. tab. 44.</NOTE>.<NOTE PLACE="marg">MOUNT ST. AU∣GUSTINE.</NOTE> The estuary is here of a great breadth, owing to a bay running opposite to Mount <HI>Augustine</HI> deeply to the east.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">COOK'S RIVER.</NOTE>The estuary of COOK'S river is of great length and extent. The river begins between <HI>Anchor Point</HI> and the opposite shore, where it is thirty miles wide: the depth very considerable, and the ebb very rapid. Far within, the channel con∣tracts to four leagues, through which rushes a prodigious tide, agitated like breakers against rocks. The rise of the tide in this confined part was twenty-one feet. It was examined seventy leagues from the entrance, as far as lat. 61. 30, long. 210, and its boundaries were found to be flat, swampy, and poorly wooded, till they reached the foot of the great mountains. Towards the north, it divides into two great branches, or perhaps distinct rivers. That to the east is distin∣guished by the name of <HI>Turn-again</HI> river. The first is a league wide, and navi∣gable, as far as was tried, for the largest ships, and continued very brackish; there is therefore the greatest probability of its having a very long course, and be∣ing, in after times, of considerable use in inland navigation: that it is of some even at present is very certain; for here, as well as in <HI>Prince William</HI>'s sound, the <HI>Indians</HI> were possessed of glass beads and great knives of <HI>English</HI> manufacture, which the <HI>Hudson</HI>'s bay company annually send in great quantities, and exchange for furs with the natives, who travel to our settlements very far from the west. The company also send copper and brass vessels; but neither copper or iron in bars. There does not seem to be any direct dealings with the <HI>Indians</HI> of this coast: the traffic is carried on by intermediate tribes, who never think of bringing furs to a people so amply supplied as the <HI>Indians</HI> are who deal with our factories. Nations who use the most pretious furs merely as a defence from the cold, make no distinction of kinds: if they could get more beads or more knives for the skins of Sea Otters
<PB N="CLI" REF="167"/>
than any other, they would instantly become articles of commerce, and find their way across the continent to the <HI>European</HI> settlements.</P>
<P>From <HI>Turn-again</HI> river to the nearest part of <HI>Hudson</HI>'s bay, is fifty-five degrees, or about sixteen hundred miles; but from the most western part of <HI>Arapathescow</HI> lake (which is intermediate) is only twenty-six degrees, or about seven hundred and fifty miles. There is no discharge out of that vast water but what runs into <HI>Hudson</HI>'s bay. We have some obscure accounts of rivers <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Particularly from one <HI>Joseph de la France,</HI> who in 1739 made a very long journey to the west, and was a very observant man. See <HI>Dobbs, Hudson's Bay,</HI> 21, 34, 35.</NOTE> which take a western course from the countries east of this coast: some of which may be those which have been seen by our navigators, and which, by means of lakes or other rivers falling into them, may prove a channel of intercourse between these <HI>Indians</HI> and the <HI>Hudson</HI>'s bay company, as soon as our friendly <HI>Indians</HI> become acquainted with the value of these maritime furs.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of <HI>Cook</HI>'s river differed very little from those of <HI>Prince William</HI>'s found. They had Dogs, which were the first seen on the coasts; Sea Otters,<NOTE PLACE="marg">DOGS.</NOTE> Martins, and white Hares: and they were plentifully supplied with Salmon and Holibut.</P>
<P>After leaving the entrance into the river, appears Cape St. <HI>Hermogenes,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">CAPE ST. HERMO∣GENES.</NOTE> disco∣vered first by BERING. It proved a naked lofty island, about six leagues in cir∣cuit, and divided from the coast by a channel a league broad. This lies in lat. 58. 15, off the vast peninsula <HI>Alaschka,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">ALASCHKA, CON∣TINENT OF AME∣RICA.</NOTE> which begins between the estuary of <HI>Cook</HI>'s river and <HI>Bristol</HI> bay, which bound its isthmus. It points south-west, and continues the crescent formed by the islands which cross the sea from <HI>Kamtschatka. Alaschka</HI> is the only name given by the natives to the continent of <HI>America.</HI> The land to the west of COOK'S river rises into mountains, with conoid tops thickly set together. The coast is frequently bold, and the rocks break into pinnacles of picturesque forms: the whole is fronted by groups of isles and clusters of small rocks. In a word, the country and shores are the most rugged and disjointed imaginable, and bear evident marks of having undergone some extraordinary change.</P>
<P>Among the isles, those of <HI>Schoumagin</HI> are the most important, which received their name from having been the place of interment of one of <HI>Bering</HI>'s crew, the first which he lost in these seas. The principal lies the farthest to the west, and is called <HI>Kadjak:</HI> it is about a hundred versts long,<NOTE PLACE="marg">KADJAK.</NOTE> and from twenty to thirty broad; and, from the account of <HI>Demetrius Bragin,</HI> who visited it from <HI>Oonalashka</HI> in 1776, is very populous. The inhabitants spoke a language different from those
<PB N="CLII" REF="168"/>
of that island: it seemed a dialect of the <HI>Greenlanders.</HI> They called their wooden shields <HI>Kuyaky,</HI> probably because they resemble a <HI>kaiak,</HI> or a little canoe, a <HI>Green∣land</HI> word for that species of boat; and themselves <HI>Kanagist,</HI> as the others style themselves <HI>Karalit.</HI> They have likewise the woman's boat, like the people of <HI>Prince William</HI>'s sound: in fact, they seem to be the same people, but more refined. They were armed with pikes, bows and arrows, and wooden shields. Their shirts were made of the skins of birds; also of the earless Marmot <HI>(Arct. Zool.</HI> i. N<SUP>o</SUP> 47), Foxes, and Sea Bears, and some of fishes skins. Dogs, Bears, common Otters, and Ermines, were observed here. Their dwellings were made with timber, and were from fifteen to twenty fathoms long, covered with a thatch and dried grass. Within they were divided into compartments for every family, and every com∣partment lined neatly with mats. The entrance was on the top, covered with frames, on which were stretched the membranes of dried intestines instead of glass<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">From a MS. communicated to me by Dr. PALLAS, <HI>Bragin</HI> was commander of a vessel which was fitted out by the merchants on a voyage to the new-discovered islands, and sailed from <HI>Ochotsk</HI> in 1772.

These people seemed to have made far greater progress in the arts than their neigh∣bors. They worked their carpets in a very curious manner; on one side close set with beaver wool. The Sea Otters skins which they brought for sale were in some parts shorn quite close with sharp stones, so that they glistened and appeared like velvet. They shewed strong proofs of genius in their invention to preserve themselves from the effects of the <HI>Russian</HI> fire-arms. They had the spirit to make an attack, and formed skreens with three parallel perpendicular rows of stakes, bound with sea-weeds and osiers; their length was twelve feet, and thickness three: under the shelter of these they marched; but their success was not cor∣respondent to their plan<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Coxe's Russ.

It often took a direction contrary to the point the wind blew from at sea, not∣withstanding there was a fresh gale. It lies in lat. 54. 48 north, long. 195. 45 W. and is evidently a link in the vulcanic chain, which extends, in the southern he∣misphere, as low at lest as that of St. <HI>Clement</HI> in <HI>Chili,</HI> in lat. 45. 30.</P>
<P>The extremity of <HI>Alaschka</HI> ends abrupt, and has opposite to it an island called <HI>Oonemak</HI> or <HI>Unmak,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">OONEMAK.</NOTE> of nearly a correspondent breadth, separated from it by a very narrow and shallow channel, situated in lat. 54. 30, and leading into <HI>Bristol</HI> bay, pervious only by boats or very small vessels. The isle is a hundred versts long, and from seven to fifteen broad; and has in the middle a vulcano. In the low parts several hot springs burst forth, to which the islanders carry the fish or flesh they want to boil; and they are also fond of bathing in the temperate parts<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Bragin's Voy. <HI>MS.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>To the west are the small isles of <HI>Oonella</HI> and <HI>Acootan:</HI> at a small distance from them is <HI>Oonalashka</HI> or <HI>Aghôun-alaiska</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Doctor PALLAS, MS.</NOTE>,<NOTE PLACE="marg">OONALASHKA.</NOTE> a name evidently referring to the continent. My MS. calls its length a hundred and twenty versts, its breadth from ten to eighteen. It is the most remote of the <HI>Russian</HI> colonies, who have now made set∣tlements on most of the isles between <HI>Asia</HI> and <HI>America;</HI> all under the care of pri∣vate adventurers. The voyage from <HI>Ochotsk</HI> or <HI>Kamtschatka</HI> lasts three or four years; and is solely undertaken for the sake of the skins of Sea Otters. Possibly other reasons will, in a little time, induce them to attempt the colonization of the continent. Timber may be one; for their northern <HI>Asiatic</HI> dominions and their islands yield none. I foresee docks and timber-yards in all convenient places. At present, the natives of these isles have only the skin-covered canoes<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">See their boats, tab. 50.</NOTE>,<NOTE PLACE="marg">NATIVES.</NOTE> and even for the ribs they are obliged to the chance of drift-wood. In these, in dress, and in weapons, they resemble the <HI>Eskimaux.</HI> The language is a dialect of the <HI>Eskimaux.</HI> They are rather of low stature. They have short necks, swarthy chubby faces, black eyes, and straight long black hair. The fashion of wearing fea∣thers or bits of sticks in their noses is used in <HI>Oonalashka.</HI> Both sexes cut their hair even over their foreheads: the men wear theirs loose behind; the females tie theirs in a bunch on the top of their head: the first wear long loose frocks, of the skins of birds; the last of the skins of Seals. The men fling over their frocks another, of the guts of the cetaceous animals, dried and oiled, to keep out the water<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">See their dresses, tab. 48, 49, 56, 57.</NOTE>; and, to

Some use the bonnet in the form of the trun∣cated cone. The women slightly tattow their faces, and often wear a string of beads pendent from their noses; both sexes perforate their under lip, but it is very uncommon to see any except the females stick in it the ornamental bone. The nose-ornaments extend far inland on the continent; for the <HI>Americans,</HI> who trade with the <HI>Hudson</HI>'s bay company, use them: but from the figures given by <HI>De Brie,</HI> they do not seem ever to have reached the people of <HI>Virginia</HI> and <HI>Florida.</HI> They inhabit jourts, or subterraneous dwellings, each common to many families, in which they live in horrible filthiness: but they are remarkably civilized in their behaviour; and have been taught by the <HI>Russians</HI> to pull off their caps, and to bow, in their salutations.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">BARROWS.</NOTE>They bury their dead on the summits of hills, and raise over the spot a barrow of stones<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Same, 521.</NOTE>, in the manner customary in all the north of <HI>Europe</HI> in very early days.</P>
<P>On the north side of the promontory <HI>Alaschka,</HI> the water decreases considerably in depth, and the mountains recede towards the bottom far inland, and leave a large tract of low land between them and the sea. Here it forms a great bay, called <HI>Bristol;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">BRISTOL BAY AND RIVER.</NOTE> with a vast river at the end, with an entrance a mile broad, seated in lat. 58. 27. Cape <HI>Newenham,</HI> lat. 58. 42, a rocky promontory, is the northern horn of the bay, eighty-two leagues from Cape <HI>Oonemak,</HI> its southern: an uni∣versal barrenness, and want of vegetation, appeared in the neighborhood of the former. The <HI>Walruses</HI> (N<SUP>o</SUP> 71) began, the 15th of <HI>July,</HI> to shew themselves in great numbers about this place: a proof that ice is not essential to their existence. The inhabitants of this coast were dressed much more squalidly than those before seen; but, like the others, deformed their noses and lips. They shaved their head or cut the hair close, and only left a few locks behind or on one side, some∣what in the <HI>Chinese</HI> fashion. From Cape <HI>Newenham,</HI> the continent runs due north. To the west is <HI>Gore</HI>'s island,<NOTE PLACE="marg">GORE'S ISLE.</NOTE> distinguished by a vast cliff, in lat. 60. 17, long. 187. 30, called <HI>Point Upright;</HI> and near it a most rugged, high, rocky islet, named the <HI>Pinnacles</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">See tab. 87,</NOTE>.

<P>From <HI>Shoal-ness,</HI> in lat. 60, long. 196, there is a gap in the <HI>American</HI> geography, as far as <HI>Point Shallow Water,</HI> lat. 62. 50; and not far from thence were the symp∣toms of the discharge of some great river, from the uninvestigated part. Be∣yond
<PB N="CLV" REF="171"/>
<HI>Point Shallow,</HI> in lat. 63. 33, is Cape <HI>Stephens;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">CAPE STEPHENS.</NOTE> and before it, at a small distance, <HI>Stuart's</HI> isle. These make the southern points of <HI>Norton's Sound,</HI> formed by a vast recess of the land to the east. All the land near the sea is low and bar∣ren, bounded inland by mountains. The trees, which were Birch, Alder, Wil∣low, and Spruce, very small; none of the last above six or eight inches in diameter: but the drift-wood, which lay in plenty on the shore, much larger; having been brought down the rivers from land more favorable to its growth. Towards the bottom of the sound, Cape <HI>Denbigh</HI> juts far to the west into the water, and forms a peninsula. It has been an island; for there are evident marks on the isthmus, that the sea had once possessed its place: a proof of the loss of the element of water in these parts, as well as in other remote parts of the globe.</P>
<P>The sound, from Cape <HI>Denbigh,</HI> is suddenly contracted, and is converted into a deep inlet, seemingly the reception of a large river. The continent, in these parts, consists of vast plains, divided by moderate hills; the former watered by several rivers meandering through them. Vegetation improves in proportion to the dis∣stance from the sea, and the trees increase in bulk. A promontory, called <HI>Bald Head,</HI> bounds the northern entrance into this inlet. Farther to the west Cape <HI>Darby,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">CAPE DARBY.</NOTE> in lat. 64. 21, makes the northern horn of this great sound.</P>
<P>Numbers of people inhabit this coast.<NOTE PLACE="marg">NATIVES.</NOTE> The men were about five feet two inches high; and in form and features resembled all the natives seen by the navi∣gators since they left <HI>Nootka Sound.</HI> They had, in their under lip, two perfora∣tions.

The <HI>Eskimaux</HI> occasionally stick their children in the top: the women of this country place them more commodiously within the upper part of the jacket, over one shoulder<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See tab. 54.</NOTE>. In language there seems considerable con∣formity. They had, like them, the woman's boat, and the <HI>Kaiack:</HI> the first they sometimes made use of as a protection from the weather, by turning it upside down, and sheltering beneath. But their hovels were the most wretched of any yet seen; consisting of only a sloping roof (without any side walls) composed of logs; a floor of the same; the entrance at one end, and a hole to permit the escape of the smoke.<NOTE PLACE="marg">THEIR SENSIBI∣LITY.</NOTE> These poor people seem very susceptible of feelings for the misfortunes of each other, which would do honor to the most polished state. A family ap∣peared, one of which was a most distorted figure, with scarcely the human form:

another, seemingly the chief, almost blind: the third, a girl: the last, the wife. She made use of Captain KING to act as a charm to restore her blind husband to his sight<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Voyage,</HI> ii. 481.</NOTE>. He was first directed to hold his breath; then to breathe on, and af∣terwards to spit on his eyes. We are not without similar superstitions.

Nat.</HI> lib. xxviii. c. 7.</NOTE> applied the same remedy to diseases of the same part: but I doubt whether they, or our polished nation, ever expressed the same feelings as this poor woman did. She related her story in the most pathetic manner; she pressed the hands of the Captain to the breast of her husband, while she was relating the calamitous history of her family; pointed sometimes to the husband, sometimes to the crip∣ple, and sometimes to the poor child. Unable to contain any longer, she burst into tears and lamentation. She was followed by the rest of her kindred in an unison, which, I trust, filled the eyes of the civilized beholders, as their relation has mine.</P>
<P>From Cape <HI>Darby</HI> the land trends to the west, and ends in <HI>Point Rodney;</HI> low land, with high land far beyond, taking a northerly direction inland. Off this point, in lat. 64. 30, is <HI>Sledge island,</HI> so called from a sledge being found on it, resembling those which the <HI>Russians</HI> use in <HI>Kamtschatka</HI> to carry goods over the snow. It was ten feet long, twenty inches broad, with a rail on each side, and shod with bone; all neatly put together, in some parts with wooden pins, but mostly with thongs of whalebone: a proof of the ingenuity of the natives. Whe∣ther it was to be drawn with dogs or rein-deer, does not appear; for the island was deserted, and only the remains of a few <HI>jourts</HI> to be seen. In lat. 64. 55, long. 192, is KING'S island, named in honor of the able and worthy continuator of the voyage. The continent opposite to it bends towards the east, and forms a shallow bay; then suddenly runs far into the sea, and makes the most western extremity yet known, and probably the most western of all. On it were several huts; and stages of bone, such as had been observed in the <HI>Tschutski</HI> country. This cape forms one side of BERING'S streights, and lies nearly opposite to <HI>East Cape,</HI> on the <HI>Asiatic</HI> shore, at the small distance of only thirty-nine miles. This lies in lat. 65. 46; is named <HI>Cape Prince of Wales;</HI> is low land, and the heights, as usual, appeared beyond; among which is a remarkable peaked hill. It would be unjust to the memory of past navigators, not to say, that there is the greatest probability that either this cape, or part of the continent adjacent to it, was dis∣covered, in 1730, by <HI>Michael Gwosdew,</HI> a land surveyor attendant on the <HI>Cossack,</HI>

<P>Here begins the <HI>Icy Sea</HI> or <HI>Frozen Ocean.</HI> The country trends strongly to the east, and forms, in lat. 67. 45, long. 194. 51, <HI>Point Mulgrave;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">POINT MUL∣GRAVE.</NOTE> the land low, backed inland with moderate hills, but all barren, and destitute of trees. From hence it makes a slight trend to the west. <HI>Cape Lisburn</HI> lies in lat. 69; and <HI>Icy Cape,</HI> the most extreme land seen by any navigators on this side, was observed in lat. 70. 29, long. 198. 20, by our illustrious seaman, on <HI>August</HI> 18th 1778. The preceding day he had made an advance as high as 70. 41; but, baffled by impenetrable ice, upon the justest reasoning was obliged to give up all thoughts of the north-east passage: which reasons were confirmed, in the following year, by his successor in command, Captain CLERKE. All the trials made by that persevering commander could not attain a higher latitude than 70. 11, long. 196. 15. He found himself laboring under a lingering disease, which he knew must be fatal, unless he could gain a more favorable climate; but his high sense of honor, and of his duty to his orders, determined him to persist, till the impossibility of success was determined by every officer. He gave way to their opinion, sailed towards the southward on <HI>July</HI> 21st, and on <HI>August</HI> 22d honorably sunk, at the age of thirty-eight, under a disorder contracted by a continued scene of hardships, endured from his earliest youth in the services of his country<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See the particulars of his services, <HI>Voyage,</HI> iii. 280.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>To such characters as these we are indebted for the little we know, and pro∣bably all that can be known, of the ICY SEA.<NOTE PLACE="marg">OF THE ICY SEA.</NOTE> The antients had some obscure notion of its coasts, and have given it the name of <HI>Scythicum Mare;</HI> a cape jutting into it was styled <HI>Scythicum Promontorium;</HI> and an island at the bottom of a deep bay to the west of it, <HI>Scythica Insula.</HI> It is following the conjectures of the inge∣nious to say, that the first may be the Cape <HI>Jalmal,</HI> and the last, <HI>Nova Zemlja,</HI> which some will make the <HI>Insula Tazata</HI> of <HI>Pliny,</HI> as it resembles in name the ri∣ver <HI>Tas,</HI> which flows almost opposite to it into the gulph of <HI>Ob</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Strahlenberg Hist. Russia, <HI>113.</HI></NOTE>. The know∣lege which the antients had of these parts must have been from traffic. The old <HI>Ladoga</HI> was, in very early times, a place of great commerce, by assistance of rivers and seas, even from the farthest parts of the <HI>Mediterranean;</HI> the coins of <HI>Syria, Arabia, Greece,</HI> and <HI>Rome,</HI> having been found in the burial-places adjoining to that antient city<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Same, 110.</NOTE>. Another channel of knowlege was formed from the great traffic carried on by the merchants, from even the remote <HI>India,</HI> up the <HI>Volga</HI> and the <HI>Kama,</HI> and from thence to <HI>Tscherdyn,</HI> an emporium on the river <HI>Kolva,</HI>
<PB N="CLVIII" REF="174"/>
seated in the antient <HI>Permia</HI> or <HI>Biormia,</HI> and not far south of the river <HI>Peczora.</HI> From thence the <HI>Biormas,</HI> who seem to have been the factors, embarked with the merchandize on that river, went down with it to the coasts of the <HI>Frozen Sea;</HI> and, after obtaining furs in exchange, they returned and delivered them, at <HI>Tscherdyn,</HI> to the foreign merchants<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Nichols's Russian Nations, <HI>i. 176.</HI></NOTE>: and from them the antients might pick up accounts.</P>
<P>The ICY SEA extends from <HI>Nova Zemlja</HI> to the coast of <HI>America.</HI> We have seen how unable even the <HI>Russians</HI> have been to survey its coasts, except by in∣terrupted detail, notwithstanding it formed part of their own vast empire. To our navigators was given the honor not only of settling parts of its geography with precision, but of exploring the whole space between the most northern pro∣montory of <HI>Asia</HI> and the farthest accessible part of <HI>America.</HI> This was a tract of one hundred leagues<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Voyage,</HI> iii. 277.</NOTE>. The traversing it was a work of infinite difficulty and danger.<NOTE PLACE="marg">DEPTH.</NOTE> The sea shallow; and the change from the greatest depth, which did not exceed thirty fathoms, to the lest, which was only eight, was sudden: the bottom muddy, caused by the quantity of earth brought down from the vast ri∣vers which pour into it from the <HI>Asiatic</HI> side. We suspect that it receives but few from the <HI>American,</HI> their general tendency being east and west. The <HI>Icy Sea</HI> is shallow, not only because its tides and currents are very inconsiderable; but its outlet through the streights of <HI>Bering</HI> very narrow, and even obstructed in the middle by the islands of <HI>St. Diomedes:</HI> both which circumstances impede the carrying away of the mud. The current, small as it is, comes chiefly from the south-west, and is another impediment. The land of each continent is very low near the shores, and high at a small distance from them: the former is one instance of a correspondent shallowness of water. The soundings off each continent, at the same distances from the shore, were exactly the same.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">ICE.</NOTE>The ice of this sea differs greatly from that of <HI>Spitzbergen.</HI> It probably is en∣tirely generated from the sea-water. The <HI>Icy Sea</HI> seems to be in no part bounded by lofty land, in the valleys of which might have been formed the stupendous <HI>icebergs,</HI> which, tumbling down, form those lofty islands we had before occasion to mention. The ice here is moveable, except about the great headlands, which are beset with a rugged mountanous ice. It is notorious, that a strong gale from the north in twenty-four hours covers the whole coast, for numbers of miles in breadth; will fill the streights of BERING, and even the <HI>Kamtschatkan</HI> seas; and in smaller pieces extend to its islands. In the <HI>Icy Sea</HI> it consists chiefly of field ice. Some fields, very large, and surrounded with lesser, from forty
<PB N="CLIX" REF="175"/>
to fifty yards in extent, to four or five; the thickness of the larger pieces was about thirty feet under water; and the greatest height of others above, about sixteen or eighteen. It was transparent, except on the surface, which was a little porous, and often very rugged: the rest compact as a wall. At times it must pack; for the mountanous ice which the <HI>Cossack Morkoff</HI> ascended (see p. c.) must have been of that nature. The destruction of the ice is not effected by the sun, in a climate where fogs reign in far greater proportion than the solar beams; neither will the streights of BERING permit the escape of quantity sufficient to clear the sea of its vast load. It must, in a little time, become wholly filled with it, was it not for the rage of the winds, which dashes the pieces together, breaks and grinds them into minute parts, which soon melt, and resolve into their ori∣ginal element.</P>
<P>The animals of this sea are very few, and may be reduced to the <HI>Polar Bear,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">ANIMALS.</NOTE> N<SUP>o</SUP> 18; the <HI>Walrus,</HI> N<SUP>o</SUP> 71; and Seals. The first does not differ from those of other arctic countries: it is beautifully engraven in tab. LXXIII. of the <HI>Voyage.</HI> Amidst the extraordinary scenery in tab. LII. is given the only accurate figure of the <HI>Walrus</HI> I have ever seen. I cannot but suspect it to be a variety of the species found in the <HI>Spitzbergen</HI> seas. The tusks are more slender, and have a slight dis∣tinguishing flexure: the whole animal is also much less. The length of one (not indeed the largest) was only nine feet four inches; its greatest circumference seven feet ten; weight, exclusive of the entrails, about eleven hundred pounds. They lay on the ice by thousands; and in the foggy weather cautioned our navi∣gators, by their roaring, from running foul of it. They are usually seen sleeping, but never without some centinels to give notice of approaching danger: these awa∣kened the next to them, they their neighbors, till the whole herd was roused. These animals are the objects of chace with the <HI>Tschutski,</HI> who eat the flesh, and cover their boats and hovels with the skins. Whales abound in this sea. Fish,<NOTE PLACE="marg">FISH.</NOTE> the food of Seals, and partly of the polar Bears, must be found here, notwith∣standing they escaped the notice of the navigators. Shells and sea-plants, the food of the <HI>Walrus,</HI> cannot be wanting.</P>
<P>Many species of birds (which will occur in their place) were seen traversing this sea. Geese and Ducks were observed migrating southward in <HI>August;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">BIRDS.</NOTE> whether from their breeding-place in a circum-polar land, or whether from the probably far-extending land of <HI>America,</HI> is not to be determined. Drift-wood was very seldom seen here. Two trees, about three feet in girth, with their roots, were once observed, but without bark or branches; a proof that they had been brought from afar, and left naked by their contest with the ice and elements.</P>
<P>The sea, from the south of BERING'S streights to the crescent of isles between
<PB N="CLX" REF="176"/>
<HI>Asia</HI> and <HI>America,</HI> is very shallow. It deepens from these streights (as the <HI>British</HI> seas do from those of <HI>Dover)</HI> till soundings are lost in the Pacific Ocean; but that does not take place but to the south of the isles. Between them and the streights is an increase from twelve to fifty-four fathom, except only off St. <HI>Thaddeus Noss,</HI> where there is a channel of greater depth. From the vulcanic disposition I am led to believe not only that there was a separation of the continents at the streights of BERING, but that the whole space, from the isles to that small opening, had once been occupied by land; and that the fury of the watery element, actuated by that of fire, had, in most remote times, subverted and overwhelmed the tract, and left the islands monumental fragments.</P>
<P>Whether that great event took place before or after the population of <HI>America,</HI> is as impossible, as it is of little moment, for us to know. We are indebted to our navigators for settling the long dispute about the point from which it was effected. They, by their discoveries, prove, that in one place the dis∣tance between continent and continent is only thirty-nine miles, not (as a celebrated cavilist <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>The author of</HI> Recherches Philosophiques sur les Americains, <HI>i. 136.</HI></NOTE> would have it) eight hundred leagues. This narrow streight has also in the middle two islands, which would greatly facilitate the migration of the <HI>Asiatics</HI> into the New World, supposing that it took place in canoes, after the convulsion which rent the two continents asunder. Besides, it may be added, that these streights are, even in the summer, often filled with ice; in winter, often frozen: in either case mankind might find an easy passage; in the last, the way was extremely ready for quadrupeds to cross, and stock the continent of <HI>America.</HI> I may fairly call in the machinery of vulcanoes to tear away the other means of transit farther to the south, and bring in to my assistance the former supposition of solid land between <HI>Kamtschatka</HI> and <HI>Oonalascha,</HI> instead of the crescent of islands, and which, prior to the great catastrophe, would have greatly enlarged the means of migration; but the case is not of that difficulty to require the solution. One means of passage is indisputably established.</P>
<P>But where, from the vast expanse of the north-eastern world, to fix on the first tribes who contributed to people the new continent, now inhabited almost from end to end, is a matter that baffles human reason. The learned may make bold and ingenious conjectures, but plain good sense cannot always accede to them. As mankind encreased in numbers, they naturally protruded one another forward. Wars might be another cause of migrations. I know no reason why the <HI>Asiatic</HI> north might not be an <HI>officina virorum,</HI> as well as the <HI>European.</HI> The overteeming country, to the east of the <HI>Riphaean</HI> mountains, must find it necessary to discharge its inhabitants: the first great wave of people was forced forward by the next to

at, more tumid and more powerful than itself: successive and new impulses con∣tinually arriving, short rest was given to that which spread over a more eastern tract; disturbed again and again, it covered fresh regions; at length, reaching the farthest limits of the Old World, found a new one, with ample space to occupy unmolested for ages; till <HI>Columbus</HI> cursed them by a discovery, which brought again new sins and new deaths to both worlds.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of the NEW do not consist of the offspring of a single nation: different people, at several periods, arrived there; and it is impossible to say, that any one is now to be found on the original spot of its colonization. It is impossible, with the lights which we have so recently received, to admit that <HI>America</HI> could receive its inhabitants (at lest the bulk of them) from any other place than eastern <HI>Asia.</HI> A few proofs may be added, taken from customs or dresses common to the inhabitants of both worlds: some have been long extinct in the old, others remain in both in full force.</P>

<P>The <HI>Tungusi,</HI> the most numerous nation resident in <HI>Sibiria,</HI> prick their faces with small punctures, with a needle, in various shapes; then rub into them char∣coal, so that the marks become indelible<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Bell's Travels, <HI>oct. ed. i. 240.</HI></NOTE>.

<P>The <HI>Tungusi</HI> use canoes made of birch-bark, distended over ribs of wood, and nicely sewed together<NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Ysbrandt Ides, <HI>in</HI> Harris's Coll. <HI>ii. 929.</HI></NOTE>.

The paddles of the <HI>Tungusi</HI> are broad at each end; those of the people near <HI>Cook</HI>'s river, and of <HI>Oonalascha,</HI> are of the same form.</P>
<P>In burying of the dead, many of the <HI>American</HI> nations place the corpse at full length, after preparing it according to their customs; others place it in a sitting posture, and lay by it the most valuable cloathing, wampum, and other matters. The <HI>Tartars</HI> did the same: and both people agree in covering the whole with earth, so as to form a <HI>tumulus,</HI> barrow, or carnedd<NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Compare <HI>Colden,</HI> i. 17; <HI>Lafitau,</HI> i. 416; and <HI>Archaeologia,</HI> ii 222. tab. xiv.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Some of the <HI>American</HI> nations hang their dead in trees. Certain of the <HI>Tungusi</HI> observe a similar custom.</P>
<P>I can draw some analogy from dress: conveniency in that article must have been consulted on both continents, and originally the materials must have been the same, the skins of birds and beasts. It is singular, that the conic bonnet of the <HI>Chinese</HI> should be found among the people of <HI>Nootka.</HI> I cannot give into the no∣tion, that the <HI>Chinese</HI> contributed to the population of the New World; but I can readily admit, that a shipwreck might furnish those <HI>Americans</HI> with a pattern for that part of the dress.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">SIMILAR FEA∣TURES.</NOTE>In respect to the features and form of the human body, almost every tribe found along the western coast has some similitude to the <HI>Tartar</HI> nations, and still retain the little eyes, small noses, high cheeks, and broad faces. They vary in size,
<PB N="CLXIII" REF="179"/>
from the lusty <HI>Calmucs</HI> to the little <HI>Nogaians.</HI> The internal <HI>Americans,</HI> such as the <HI>Five Indian</HI> nations, who are tall of body, robust in make, and of oblong faces, are derived from a variety among the <HI>Tartars</HI> themselves. The fine race of <HI>Tschutski</HI> seem to be the stock from which those <HI>Americans</HI> are derived.

<P>But about <HI>Prince William's Sound</HI> begins a race,<NOTE PLACE="marg">ESKIMAUX.</NOTE> chiefly distinguished by their dress, their canoes, and their instruments of the chace, from the tribes to the south of them. Here commences the <HI>Eskimaux</HI> people, or the race known by that name in the high latitudes of the eastern side of the continent. They may be divided into two varieties. At this place they are of the largest size. As they advance northward they decrease in height, till they dwindle into the dwarfish tribes which occupy some of the coasts of the <HI>Icy Sea</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See Mr.</HI> Hearne's Discoveries.</NOTE>, and the maritime parts of <HI>Hudson</HI>'s bay, of <HI>Greenland,</HI> and <HI>Terra de Labrador.</HI> The famous <HI>Japanese</HI> map <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Given by <HI>Kaempfer</HI> to Sir <HI>Hans Sloane,</HI> and now preserved in the <HI>British Museum</HI></NOTE> places some islands seemingly within the streights of BERING, on which is bestowed the title of <HI>Ya Zue,</HI> or the kingdom of <HI>the dwarfs.</HI> Does not this in some manner authenticate the chart, and give us reason to suppose that <HI>America</HI> was not unknown to the <HI>Japanese,</HI> and that they had (as is mentioned by <HI>Kaempfer</HI> and <HI>Charlevoix</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Hist. Japan. <HI>i. 67.</HI>—Charlevoix, fastes Chronologiques, <HI>ann. 168.</HI></NOTE>) made voyages of discovery, and, according to the last, actually wintered on the continent? That they might have met with the <HI>Eskimaux</HI> is very probable; whom, in comparison of themselves, they might justly distinguish by the name of dwarfs. The reason of their low stature is very ob∣vious: these dwell in a most severe climate, amidst penury of food; the former in one much more favorable, abundant in provisions; circumstances that tend to prevent the degeneracy of the human frame. At the island of <HI>Oonalascha</HI> a dialect of the <HI>Eskimaux</HI> is in use, which was continued along the whole coast, from thence north∣ward. I have before mentioned the similarity in the instruments between the <HI>Americans</HI> of this side of the coast and the <HI>Eskimaux,</HI> which is continued even to <HI>Greenland.</HI></P>
<P>I cannot think the accounts well supported,<NOTE PLACE="marg">WELSH.</NOTE> that <HI>America</HI> received any part of its first inhabitants from <HI>Europe,</HI> prior to the fifteenth century. The <HI>Welsh</HI> fondly imagine that our country contributed, in 1170, to people the New World, by the adventure of <HI>Madoc,</HI> son of <HI>Owen Gwynedd,</HI> who, on the death of his father, sailed there, and colonized part of the country. All that is advanced in proof is, a quo∣tation from one of our poets, which proves no more than that he had distinguished himself by sea and land. It is pretended that he made two voyages: that sailing west, he left <HI>Ireland</HI> so far to the north, that he came to a land unknown, where
<PB N="CLXIV" REF="180"/>
he saw many strange things: that he returned home, and, making a report of the fruitfulness of the new-discovered country, prevaled on numbers of the <HI>Welsh</HI> of each sex to accompany him on a second voyage, from which he never returned. The favorers of this opinion assert, that several <HI>Welsh</HI> words, such as <HI>gwrando,</HI> to hearken or listen; the isle of <HI>Croeso</HI> or <HI>welcome; Cape Bre∣ton,</HI> from the name of our own island; <HI>gwynndwr,</HI> or the white water; and <HI>pengwin,</HI> or the bird with a white head; are to be found in the <HI>American</HI> lan∣guage<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Powel's Hist. Wales, <HI>228, 229.</HI></NOTE>. I can lay little stress on this argument, because likeness of sound in a few words will not be deemed sufficient to establish the fact; especially if the meaning has been evidently perverted: for example, the whole <HI>Pinguin</HI> tribe have unfor∣tunately not only black heads, but are not inhabitants of the northern hemisphere; the name was also bestowed on them by the <HI>Dutch,</HI> a <HI>Pinguedine,</HI> from their excessive fatness<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Clus. Exot. <HI>101.</HI></NOTE>: but the inventor of this, thinking to do honor to our country, inconsiderately caught at a word of <HI>European</HI> origin, and unheard of in the New World. It may be added, that the <HI>Welsh</HI> were never a naval people; that the age in which <HI>Madoc</HI> lived was peculiarly ignorant in navigation; and the most which they could have attempted must have been a mere coasting voyage.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">NORWEGIANS.</NOTE>The <HI>Norwegians</HI> put in for share of the glory, on grounds rather better than the <HI>Welsh.</HI> By their settlements in <HI>Iceland</HI> and in <HI>Greenland,</HI> they had arrived within so small a distance of the New World, that there is at lest a possibility of its having been touched at by a people so versed in maritime affairs, and so adventurous, as the antient <HI>Nortmans</HI> were. The proofs are much more numerous than those produced by the <HI>British</HI> historians; for the discovery is mentioned in several of the <HI>Icelandic</HI> manuscripts. The period was about the year 1002, when it was visited by one <HI>Biorn;</HI> and the discovery pursued to greater effect by <HI>Leif,</HI> the son of <HI>Eric,</HI> the discoverer of <HI>Greenland.</HI> It does not appear that they reached farther than <HI>Labrador;</HI> on which coast they met with <HI>Eskimaux,</HI> on whom they bestowed the name of <HI>Skraelingue<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> or dwarfish people, from their small stature. They were armed with bows and arrows, and had leathern canoes, such as they have at present. All this is pro∣bable; nor should the tale of the <HI>German,</HI> called <HI>Turkil,</HI> one of the crew, inva∣lidate the account. He was one day missing; but soon returned, leaping and singing with all the extravagant marks of joy a <HI>bon vivant</HI> could shew, on disco∣vering the inebriating fruit of his country, the grape<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Mallet's Northern Antiq.

To convince his commander, he brought several bunches, who from that circumstance named the country <HI>Vinland.</HI> I do
<PB N="CLXV" REF="181"/>
not deny that <HI>North America</HI> produces the true vine<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Glover's Account of Virginia, Phil. Trans. Abr. <HI>iii. 570.</HI></NOTE>; but it is found in far lower latitudes than our adventurers could reach in the time employed in their voyage, which was comprehended in a very small space. I have no doubt of the discovery; but, as the land was never colonized, nor any advantages made of it, it may be fairly conjectured, that they reached no farther than the barren country of <HI>Labrador.</HI></P>
<P>The continent which stocked <HI>America</HI> with the human race, poured in the brute creation through the same passage. Very few quadrupeds continued in the peninsula of <HI>Kamtschatka.</HI> I can enumerate only twenty-five which are inhabitants of land; for I must omit the marine animals, which had at all times power of changing their situation: all the rest persisted in their migration, and fixed their resi∣dence in the New World. Seventeen of the <HI>Kamtschatkan</HI> quadrupeds are found in <HI>America:</HI> others are common only to <HI>Sibiria</HI> or <HI>Tartary,</HI> having, for unknown causes, entirely evacuated <HI>Kamtschatka,</HI> and divided themselves between <HI>America</HI> and the parts of <HI>Asia</HI> above cited. Multitudes again have deserted the Old World, even to an individual, and fixed their seats at distances most remote from the spot from which they took their departure; from mount <HI>Ararat,</HI> the resting-place of the ark, in a central part of the Old World, and excellently adapted for the dispersion of the animal creation to all its parts. We need not be startled at the vast journies many of the quadrupeds took to arrive at their present seats: Might not numbers of species have found a convenient abode in the vast <HI>Alps</HI> of <HI>Asia,</HI> instead of wandering to the <HI>Cordilleras</HI> of <HI>Chili?</HI> or might not others have been contented with the boundless plains of <HI>Tartary,</HI> instead of tra∣velling thousands of miles, to the extensive flats of <HI>Pampas?</HI>—To endeavour to elucidate common difficulties is certainly a trouble worthy of the philosopher and of the divine; not to attempt it would be a criminal indolence, a neglect to
<Q>Vindicate the ways of God to man.</Q>
But there are multitudes of points beyond the human ability to explain, and yet are truths undeniable: the facts are indisputable, notwithstanding the causes are concealed. In such cases, faith must be called in to our relief. It would certainly be the height of folly to deny to that Being who broke open the great fountains of the deep to effect the deluge—and afterwards, to compel the dispersion of mankind to people the globe, directed the confusion of languages—powers in∣ferior in their nature to these. After these wondrous proofs of Omnipotency,
<PB N="CLXVI" REF="182"/>
it will be absurd to deny the possibility of infusing instinct into the brute creation. DEUS <HI>est anima brutorum;</HI> GOD himself is the soul of brutes: His pleasure must have determined their will, and directed several species, and even whole genera, by impulse irresistible, to move by slow progression to their destined re∣gions. But for that, the <HI>Llama</HI> and the <HI>Pacos</HI> might still have inhabited the heights of <HI>Armenia</HI> and some more neighboring <HI>Alps,</HI> instead of laboring to gain the distant <HI>Peruvian Andes;</HI> the whole genus of <HI>Armadillos,</HI> slow of foot, would never have absolutely quitted the torrid zone of the Old World for that of the New; and the whole tribe of Monkies would have gambolled together in the forests of <HI>India,</HI> instead of dividing their residence between the shades of <HI>Indostan</HI> and the deep forests of the <HI>Brasils.</HI> Lions and Tigers might have infested the hot parts of the New World, as the first do the deserts of <HI>Africa,</HI> and the last the provinces of <HI>Asia;</HI> or the Pantherine animals of <HI>South America</HI> might have re∣mained additional scourges with the savage beasts of those antient continents. The Old World would have been overstocked with animals; the New remained an unanimated waste! or both have contained an equal portion of every beast of the earth. Let it not be objected, that animals bred in a southern climate, af∣ter the descent of their parents from the ark, would be unable to bear the frost and snow of the rigorous north, before they reached <HI>South America,</HI> the place of their final destination. It must be considered, that the migration must have been the work of ages; that in the course of their progress each generation grew hardened to the climate it had reached; and that after their arrival in <HI>America,</HI> they would again be gradually accustomed to warmer and warmer climates, in their removal from north to south, as they had in the reverse, or from south to north. Part of the Tigers still inhabit the eternal snows of <HI>Ararat,</HI> and mul∣titudes of the very same species live, but with exalted rage, beneath the Line, in the burning soil of <HI>Borneo</HI> or <HI>Sumatra;</HI> but neither Lions or Tigers ever mi∣grated into the New World. A few of the first are found in <HI>India</HI> and <HI>Persia,</HI> but they are found in numbers only in <HI>Africa.</HI> The Tiger extends as far north as western <HI>Tartary,</HI> in lat. 40. 50, but never has reached <HI>Africa.</HI> I shall close this account with observing, that it could be from no other part of the globe except <HI>Asia,</HI> from whence the New World could receive the animal creation.</P>
<P>The late voyage of the illustrious COOK has reduced the probable conjectures of philosophers into certainty. He has proved that the limits of the Old and New World approach within thirteen leagues of each other. We know that the intervening streights are frequently frozen up; and we have great reason to suppose, that the two continents might have been once united, even as low as the <HI>Aleutian</HI> islands, or lat. 52. 30. Thus are discovered two means of passage from <HI>Asia</HI> to <HI>America;</HI> the last
<PB N="CLXVII" REF="183"/>
in a climate not more rigorous than that which several animals might very well endure, and yet afterwards proceed gradually to the extreme of heat.</P>
<P>In fact, every other system of the population of the New World is now over∣thrown. The conjectures of the learned, respecting the vicinity of the Old and New, are now, by the discoveries of our great navigator, lost in conviction. The strained systems of divines, laudably indeed exerted in elucidating SACRED WRIT, appear to have been ill-founded; but, in the place of imaginary hypothe∣ses, the real place of migration is uncontrovertibly pointed out. Some (from a passage in <HI>Plato</HI>) have extended over the <HI>Atlantic,</HI> from the streights of <HI>Gibraltar</HI> to the coast of <HI>North</HI> and <HI>South America,</HI> an island equal in size to the continents of <HI>Asia</HI> and <HI>Africa;</HI> over which had passed, as over a bridge, from the latter, men and animals; wool-headed Negroes, and Lions and Tigers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Catcott on the Deluge, <HI>edit. 2d. p. 139, 15,</HI> &amp;c.</NOTE>, none of which ever existed in the New World. A mighty sea arose, and in one day and night engulphed this stupendous tract, and with it every being which had not com∣pleted its migration into <HI>America.</HI> The whole Negro race, and almost every Quadruped, now inhabitants of <HI>Africa,</HI> perished in this critical day. Five only are to be found at present in <HI>America;</HI> and of these only one, the Bear<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">On the reasoning of Mr. <HI>Zimmerman</HI> (<HI>Zool.

Of the Quadrupeds, the Bear, Stag, Wolf, Fox, and Weesel, are the only animals which we can pronounce with certainty to be found on each continent. The Stag<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Shaw's Travels,</HI> 243. Quere? whether exactly the same with the <HI>European.</HI></NOTE>, Fox, and Weesel, have made also no farther progress in <HI>Africa</HI> than the north; but on the same continent the Wolf is spread over every part, yet is unknown in <HI>South America,</HI> as are the Fox and Weesel. I suspect, besides, that the Stag hath not advanced farther south than <HI>Mexico.</HI> In <HI>Africa</HI> and <HI>South America</HI> the Bear is very local, being met with only in the north of the first, and on the <HI>Andes</HI> in the last. Some cause unknown arrested its progress in <HI>Africa,</HI> and impelled the migration of a few into the <HI>Chilian Alps,</HI> and induced them to leave unoccupied the vast tract from <HI>North America</HI> to the lofty <HI>Cordilleras.</HI>—My promised Table of Quadrupeds will at once give a view of those which inhabit <HI>North America,</HI> and are either peculiar to it, or are met

with in other countries. It certainly will point out the course they have taken in their migration; and, in case misnomers are avoided, will reduce to the single continent of <HI>Asia</HI> the original country from whence they sprung. Men of the first abilities, and first in learning, who have neglected the study of natural history, will give Lions and Tigers to <HI>America,</HI> misled by the ignorance of tra∣vellers, who mistake the Puma, N<SUP>o</SUP> 14 of this Work, for the first; and the spotted wild beasts, allied to the Pantherine race, for the second.</P>

<P><PB N="CLXXV" REF="191"/>Some years ago a very important discovery was made,<NOTE PLACE="marg">JOURNEY TO THE ICY SEA.</NOTE> not very remote from the place where Captain COOK was obliged to desist from his northern voyage. Mr. <HI>Samuel Hearne,</HI> in the service of the <HI>Hudson's Bay</HI> Company, by direction of the governors, began a journey, on <HI>December</HI> 7th 1770, towards the northern li∣mits of <HI>America.</HI> He went attended only by <HI>Indians,</HI> with whom he had been long acquainted. He set out from <HI>Prince of Wales</HI> fort, 58. 50, north lat. He for a long space took a north-western course, crossed <HI>Menischtic</HI> lake, in lat. 61, a water thirty-five miles in breadth, full of fine islands, and joining with the river <HI>Namassy.</HI> He passed over <HI>Wiethen</HI> and <HI>Cassed</HI> lakes, and from the last kept due west. In <HI>April</HI> he reached <HI>Thleweyaza Yeth,</HI> a small lake in long. 19, west from <HI>Churchil</HI> fort, lat. 61. 30, near which he made some stay to build canoes, now requisite against the breaking up of the frost. From that lake he began a course due north, and crossed a chain of lakes, of which <HI>Titumeg</HI> is one. In lat. 64. he went over <HI>Peshew</HI> lake; after that, the great lake <HI>Cogeed,</HI> out of which issues a river pointing north-east, which is supposed to fall into <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ffin</HI>'s bay. About the middle of <HI>June</HI> he crossed the great river <HI>Conge-catha∣wha-chaga,</HI> in lat. 68. 46; and from <HI>Churchil</HI> river west long. 24. 2. About those parts are the <HI>Stoney Mountains,</HI> extending in longitude from 116 to 122 from <HI>London:</HI> craggy, and of a tremendous aspect. On <HI>July</HI> 7th he arrived at <HI>Buffalo</HI> lake, in lat. 69. 30: here he first saw the <HI>Musk Buffalo,</HI> N<SUP>o</SUP> 2. Near the north end is <HI>Grizzle Bear-hill,</HI> in about lat. 70, so called from its being the haunt of numbers of those animals. On <HI>July</HI> 13th he reached the banks of <HI>Copper River,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">COPPER RIVER.</NOTE> which runs due north into the <HI>Icy Sea.</HI> About the south end is much wood, and very high hills. Its current is very rapid, and its channel choaked with shoals, and crossed with stoney ridges, which form three great cataracts. Its banks are high, the breadth about a hundred and eighty yards; but in some places it expands into the form of a lake. In an island of the river unfortunately happened to be a summer encampment of five tents of <HI>Eskimaux.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">ESKIMAUX.</NOTE> The <HI>Indians</HI> attendant on Mr. <HI>Hearne</HI> grew furious at the sight of them. It is their firm opinion, that these savages are magicians, and that all the evils they experience result from their incantations. Mr. <HI>Hearne</HI> in vain solicited his <HI>Indians</HI> to forbear injuring these poor people. They, with their usual cowardice, deferred the attack till night, when they surprised and murdered every one, to the number of between twenty and thirty. A young woman made her escape, and embraced Mr. <HI>Hearne</HI>'s feet; but she was pursued by a barbarian, and transfixed to the ground. He observed in their tents (which were made of deer-skins with the hair on) copper vessels, and whale-bone, and the skins of Seals, wooden troughs, and kettles made of a soft stone (by his description a <HI>lapis ollaris),</HI> and dishes and spoons formed from
<PB N="CLXXVI" REF="192"/>
the thick horns of the Buffalo. Their arms are spears, darts, and bows and ar∣rows; the last pointed with stone or copper, but most rudely made, for want of proper tools. In their dress they much resemble the <HI>Eskimaux</HI> of <HI>Hudson's Bay,</HI> but the tails of their jackets are shorter; neither do the women, like them, stiffen out the tops of their boots. Their canoes differ in not having long projecting prows, but in other respects are of the same construction. In most circumstances these people resemble those of the <HI>Bay;</HI> and differ materially only in one, for the men in these pull out by the roots all the hair of their heads.—Mr. <HI>Hearne</HI> first saw the sea on <HI>July</HI> 16, at the distance of eight miles. He went to the mouth of the river (in lat. 72; west long, from <HI>London</HI> 121) which he found full of shoals and falls, and inaccessible to the tide, which seemed to flow twelve or fourteen feet. The sea was at this time full of ice, and on many pieces he saw Seals. The land trended both to the east and to the west, and the sea was full of islands. The land about <HI>Copper</HI> river, for the space of nine or ten miles to the sea, con∣sisted of fine marshes, filled in many places with tall Willow, but no sort of berry-bearing shrubs. There are no woods within thirty miles of the mouth of <HI>Copper</HI> river; and those which then appear, consist of ill-shaped and stunted Pines.</P>
<P>The people who live nearest to this river, are the <HI>Copper-mine Indians,</HI> and the <HI>Plat-cotes de Chiens,</HI> or <HI>Dog-ribbed Indians;</HI> these have no direct commerce with <HI>Hudson's Bay,</HI> but sell their furs to the more southern <HI>Indians,</HI> who come for them, and bring them down to the settlements. The <HI>Dog-ribbed Indian;</HI> still make their knives of stones and bones, and head their arrows with slate. The <HI>Copper Indians</HI> have abundance of native copper in their country; they make with it ice-chissels and arrow-heads.

<P>Mr. <HI>Hearne</HI> set out on his return the 22d of <HI>July.</HI> He took, in some places, a route different from what he did in going, and got to the settlements in <HI>June</HI> 1772. I have perused the journal, and had frequent conversation with Mr. <HI>Hearne</HI> the last year. I took the liberty to question him about the waters he had crossed during winter upon the ice; and whether they might not have been at that time obstructed streights, a passage to the <HI>Pacific Ocean?</HI> He assured me, that he could make no mistake: that he passed over many of them in canoes during the sum∣mer,
<PB N="CLXXVII" REF="193"/>
and that the others had large rivers running out of them, almost every one to the west: that the <HI>Indians,</HI> who crossed them annually, in their way to the north to trade for furs, were exceedingly well acquainted with them, and knew them to be fresh-water lakes; and in particular used to fish in them for Pikes, fish notoriously known never to frequent salt-water.</P>
<P>I must now take a blind unguided course along the <HI>Icy Sea.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">GREENLAND.</NOTE> The charts give the land a turn to the south, in lat. 81. long. 22 from <HI>London.</HI> This is the most northern extremity of the country called <HI>Greenland,</HI> if it reaches so far; but, be∣yond the discovery by Mr. <HI>Hearne,</HI> in lat. 72, the northern limits given in our charts appear to be merely conjectural. To the south, on the eastern coast, in 1670, was seen land in lat. 79. Another part, in lat. 77. 30, called in the maps <HI>the land of Edam,</HI> was seen in 1655. The inlet named <HI>Gael-hamkes,</HI> in lat. 75, was discovered in 1664.

<P><HI>Torfaeus</HI> enumerates seventeen bishops who presided over the diocese. The last prelate was appointed in 1408. The <HI>black death</HI> had almost depopulated the coun∣try not long before that period. Probably the surviving inhabitants fell victims to want, or were extirpated by the natives: for, after that year, we hear no more of them. It certainly had been well inhabited: the ruins of houses and churches evince its former state. In the fifteenth century the kings of <HI>Denmark</HI> attempted to discover whether any of the antient race remained; but all in vain: the adventurers were driven off the coast by the ice with which it was blocked up, which remains an invincible obstacle to re-settle the eastern coast, even were there the lest tempta∣tion.

<P>To describe <HI>Greenland,</HI> would be to ring changes on ice, and snow, and lofty mountains (some, according to Mr. <HI>Crantz,</HI> a thousand fathoms high) rising into broken crags or sharp spires, or vallies with no other garniture than moss and some moor grass; and in some parts are long flat mountains, clad with perpetual ice and snow. Where the birds, by their dung, have formed a little soil, some plants are found.

<P>I have mentioned the islands of ice at p.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">TIDES.</NOTE>The tides rise at the south of this country three fathoms, in lat 65; on the west side two, or in spring-tides three; at <HI>Disco,</HI> about lat. 69, only one; further north it sinks even to one foot.

<P><PB N="CLXXXI" REF="197"/>During the long day of the short summer is considerable heat.

Fogs give a gloom to the summer, and frost-smoke often adds horror to the winter. It rises out of the opening of the ice in the sea, and peels off the very skin from those who venture to approach it.

<P>The <HI>Greenlanders</HI> fastidiously style themselves <HI>Innuit,</HI> i. e. <HI>men,</HI> as if they were the standard of the human race; yet few of them attain the height of five feet; but are well made. Their hair is long and black; their faces flat; their eyes small. They are a branch of the <HI>Eskimaux,</HI> the small race which borders all the <HI>Arctic</HI> coasts. They originated from the <HI>Samoied Asiatics,</HI> who, passing over into the New World, have lined the coast from <HI>Prince William's Sound</HI> on the western side, in lat. 61, quite to the southern part of <HI>Labrador</HI> on the eastern. They crept gradually in their little canoes northward, and diminished in size in their progress, till they attained their full degeneracy in the <HI>Eskimaux</HI> and <HI>Green∣landers.</HI> Similar people, or vestiges of them, have been seen in different places, from <HI>Prince William's Sound</HI> to the north of BERING'S streights. They were again seen by Mr. <HI>Hearne</HI> in lat. 72. By report of the <HI>Greenlanders</HI> of <HI>Disco</HI> bay, there are a few inhabitants in <HI>Baffin</HI>'s bay, in lat. 78. <HI>Egede</HI> says, that the coun∣try is peopled to lat. 76<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">As quoted in <HI>Green</HI>'s map of <HI>America.</HI></NOTE>; but the highest colonized spot is at <HI>Noogsook,</HI> in lat. 71. They are a race made for the climate, and could no more bear removal to a tem∣perate clime, than an animal of the torrid zone could into our unequal sky: seasons, and defect of habitual food, would soon bring on their destruction. This race has been found to agree in manners, habits, and weapons, and in many instances in language, from <HI>Prince William's Sound</HI> to the end of <HI>Labrador,</HI> a tract extending near fifteen hundred leagues<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">COOK'S <HI>Voy.</HI> i Pref.

<P><HI>Greenland</HI> has been most happy in its Zoologist. The Reverend Mr. <HI>Otto Fa∣bricius,</HI> whom a laudable zeal for enlightening the minds of the gross inhabitants,

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">QUADRUPEDS.</NOTE>The Quadrupeds of this country are, the <HI>Rein-deer,</HI> N<SUP>o</SUP> 4, which are here merely considered as objects of the chace. Their number is lessened greatly, and they are now only found in the most remote parts. The <HI>Ukalcrajek</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Faun. Groenl. <HI>p. 26.</HI></NOTE> is, I suspect, an animal of imagination. It is said, by the <HI>Greenlanders,</HI> to be long∣eared, hare-lipped, and to resemble that animal; to have a short tail; to be of a white color, with a dark list down the back, and of the size of a Rein-deer. The DOGS, p. 41, resemble Wolves in figure, size, and nature. Left to them∣selves, they hunt in packs the few animals of the country, for the sake of prey. They exactly resemble the Dogs of the <HI>Eskimaux</HI> of <HI>Labrador.</HI> It is probable, that they might have been originally brought here by their masters, who first fled that country, and populated <HI>Greenland.</HI> ARCTIC FOXES, N<SUP>o</SUP> 10, abound here; and, with POLAR BEARS, N<SUP>o</SUP> 18, infest the country. Had I not such excellent authority, I should have doubted whether the <HI>Wolverene,</HI> N<SUP>o</SUP> 21, usually an inhabitant of wooded countries, was found in <HI>Greenland;</HI> but it is certainly met with, yet rarely, in the southern parts, where it preys on the Rein-deer and White Hares. It must have been originally wafted hither on the ice from <HI>Terra de Labrador,</HI> the nearest place to this, of which it is an inhabitant. The VARYING HARE, N<SUP>o</SUP> 37, is very common. The WALRUS, and five species of Seals, inhabit these seas: the Common, N<SUP>o</SUP> 72; the Great, N<SUP>o</SUP> 73; the Rough, N<SUP>o</SUP> 74; the Hooded, N<SUP>o</SUP> 76; the Harp, N<SUP>o</SUP> 77; and an obscure species, called by the <HI>Laplanders, Fatne Vindac,</HI> with a round head and long snout, bending like the proboscis of an elephant<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Same, p. 17.—<HI>Leems Lapm.</HI> 214, 215.</NOTE>. Mr. <HI>Fabricius</HI> adds to the marine animals, the Whale-tailed <HI>Manati,</HI> N<SUP>o</SUP> 81, of which he once saw the head partly consumed.</P>
<P>The Polar Bears, Seals, and Manati, were originally natives of these coun∣tries. The other Quadrupeds found their way here from either <HI>Hudson's Bay</HI> or <HI>Labrador,</HI> on the islands of ice. The <HI>Arctic</HI> Fox found the same kind of conveyance from <HI>Greenland</HI> to <HI>Iceland</HI> as it did with the Rein-deer to <HI>Spitzbergen.</HI> To the last was wafted, probably from <HI>Labrador,</HI> the Common Weesel, the Red or Com∣mon Fox; and the Mouse, mentioned p. XLIX, missed <HI>Greenland,</HI> but arrived at and stocked <HI>Iceland;</HI> and the Common Bat was originally tempest-driven to the latter from <HI>Norway:</HI> the Wolverene and Varying Hare never reached farther than <HI>Greenland.</HI>—This seems the progress of Quadrupeds in the frigid zone, as high as land is found.</P>

<P>JOHN DAVIS, a most able seaman, was the first who examined the west side of <HI>Greenland.</HI> Before his time the eastern coast was the only part known to <HI>Europeans.</HI> He made there three different voyages, in 1585, 1586, and 1587. After doubling <HI>Cape Farewell,</HI> he sounded, and could not find bottom with three hundred fathoms of line. North of what he properly called <HI>the Land of Desola∣tion,</HI> he arrived in a filthy, black, and stagnating water, of the depth of a hun∣dred and twenty fathoms. He found drift-wood in lat. 65, and one entire tree sixty feet long, with its root; the species were Fir, Spruce, and Juniper<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Davis's Voy. <HI>in</HI> Hackluyt, <HI>iii, 101.</HI></NOTE>, which came down from remote places on the banks of the rivers of <HI>Hudson's Bay;</HI> for Mr. <HI>Hutchins</HI> assures me, that to this day, in certain years, vast quanti∣ties of timber are brought down with the ice at the opening of the rivers. He also met with black Pumices<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Same, 111.</NOTE>, whether from neighboring vulcanoes, burning or ex∣tinct, remains unknown; or whether, which is most probable, conveyed there from <HI>Iceland.</HI> The stone of the country is mostly granitical.

<P>DAVIS got as high as lat. 72, and called the country <HI>London Coast.</HI> The streight he passed, between the west of <HI>Greenland</HI> and the great islands, is honored by his name. He seems to have been engaged among the great islands; for he says he sailed sixty leagues up a sound, found the sea of the same color with the main sea, and saw several Whales. He sailed through another sound to the south-west, found ninety fathom water at the entrance; but within could not touch ground with three hundred and thirty. He had hopes of having found the long-sought-for passage. The tides rose six or seven fathoms; but, as is frequent among islands, the flood came from such variety of places, that he could not trace its principal origin<NOTE N="†" PLACE="marg">Hackluyt, <HI>iii. 102.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">BAFFIN'S BAY.</NOTE>At lat. 72. 30, I must take as my pilot that great seaman <HI>William Baffin,</HI> who gave name to the great bay I now enter on. His first voyage was in 1613; his second, in which he made the most effectual trial for the north-west passage, was in 1616. He passed through <HI>Davis's Streights.</HI> In lat. 70. 20, on the <HI>London Coast,</HI> he found the tides rise only eight or nine feet. In <HI>Horn Sound,</HI> lat. 73. 45, he met with several people<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="marg">Same, 846.</NOTE>. To the north of that, in 75. 40, was a large and open bay; <HI>Cape Dudley Digges</HI> forms its northern point; within is <HI>Westenholme Sound;</HI> beyond that, <HI>Whale Sound;</HI> and in the extreme north, or bottom of this great bay, is that named by <HI>Baffin</HI> after Sir <HI>Thomas Smith,</HI> lying in 78 degrees. In those three sounds were abun∣dance of Whales; but in the last the largest in all this bay. It is highly probable, that there are one or more communications from hence to the <HI>Icy Sea,</HI> through which the Whales pass at certain seasons; and this (if I may collect from their numbers) might be that of their migration southward. The distance into the <HI>Icy Sea</HI> can be but very small, but probably blocked up with ice; or if not, from the sudden shifting of the ice in that sea by the change of wind, the passage must be attended with too great hazard to be attempted. The ice prevented our great seaman from making trial of the tides in this bay, which would have brought the matter to greater certainty. He saw multitudes of <HI>Walruses</HI> and Seals in these parts, but no signs of inhabitants. From hence the land trended westerly,
<PB N="CLXXXVII" REF="203"/>
to a sound he called by the name of <HI>Alderman Jones,</HI> in lat. 76. 40. Here the land ran due south to a great sound in lat. 74. 20, which he called Sir <HI>James Lancaster</HI>'s. From this place the land took an eastern curvature, to the streights between the continent and <HI>Cumberland</HI> island. <HI>Baffin</HI> took his course between that isle and the isle of <HI>Saint James,</HI> left his name to the streight he passed, and arrived safe in <HI>Cockin's Sound,</HI> on the coast of <HI>West Greenland,</HI> where he found the tide rise eighteen feet: this, and similar excesses, arising from the confined situation of places<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">For the account of this curious voyage, see <HI>Purchas,</HI> iii. from p. 836 to 848.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>This is the only voyage ever made into <HI>Baffin's Bay. Christian</HI> IV. of <HI>Denmark,</HI> in 1619, sent <HI>John Munck,</HI> a most able seaman, to make discoveries in these parts; but, notwithstanding any surmises of his having reached this famous bay, he got no farther than <HI>Hudson's Bay;</HI> to which, in honor of his master, he gave the name of <HI>Christian Sea.</HI> He passed a miserable winter in <HI>Churchill</HI> river, and re∣turned home the next year, after losing, during his stay on shore, every man but two<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Clerk of the <HI>California's Voy.</HI> i. 106.—For a further account of this unfortunate voyage, see <HI>Churchill</HI>'s Collection, ii. 472.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Before I quit these frozen regions, I must once more return to <HI>Spitzbergen,</HI> to relate, what has but very lately been communicated to me, that the <HI>Russians</HI> have of late attempted to colonize these dreadful islands. They have, for a few years past, sent parties to continue there the whole year; who have established settle∣ments on the isle of <HI>Spitzbergen,</HI> at <HI>Croon Bay, King's Bay, Magdalena Bay, Smee∣renburgh,</HI> and <HI>Green Harbour;</HI> where they have built huts, each of which is oc∣cupied by about two boats crews, or twenty-six men. They bring with them salted fish, rye-flour, and the serum or whey of sour milk. The whey is their chief beverage, and is also used in baking their bread. Each hut has an oven, which serves also as a stove; and their fuel is wood, which they bring with them from <HI>Archangel.</HI> The huts are above ground, and most surprizingly warm; placed also in situations which may guard them as much as possible from the keen∣ness of the northern wind.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Erskine Tonnach,</HI> surgeon of <HI>Dunbar</HI> (who, by the friendship of the worthy Mr. <HI>George Paton,</HI> of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> favored me with this account) gives me the following particulars from his own knowledge.—"During our slay on the island, my curiosity prompted me to go on shore, that I might see the oeconomy of these arctic settlers; and had an opportunity of seeing them dine: and though their fare appeared coarse, the dispatch they use, said a great deal for their health and
<PB N="CLXXXVIII" REF="204"/>
appetite. They boil their fish with water and rye-meal: and this constitutes their diet during winter. In the summer they live chiefly on fowls, or their eggs; but in general they forbear flesh, as the fasts prescribed by their religion are so nu∣merous. They are dressed in the skins of the animals they kill, which they use with the fur side next to their bodies: their bedding is likewise composed of skins, chiefly of those of the Bear or Rein Deer. The skin of the Fox is the most va∣luable; but these are preserved as articles of commerce in their own country. They catch the Beluga, or white Whale, in nets, being conversant in this species of fishery; but are ignorant of that of the great Whale. They were very solicitous to get information on that subject; which I endeavoured to instruct them in, in return for the information they so readily gave me. They are most excellent marksmen; but, what is peculiar, in presenting their piece, they do not raise it to their shoulder, but place the butt-end between their arm and their side, fixing their eye on the object toward which they direct the barrel. I saw a Bear receive a considerable shot: it astonished me greatly to see the animal apply great quan∣tities of snow to the part (which was bleeding freely) as if conscious of its styptic powers. It retreated with much slowness; but at short intervals looked behind, and, with much art, threw abundance of snow with its hind-paws into the wound. Few of the <HI>Russians</HI> die from the severity of the cold, but are often frost-bitten, so as to lose their toes or fingers; for they are so hardy as to hunt in all weathers. I naturally asked them, Had they a surgeon? They replied, 'No! no! CHRIST is our doctor!' They quit the island in <HI>September,</HI> and are privileged to leave the place by the 22d of that month, whether they are relieved by a fresh party from <HI>Russia</HI> or not."—Let me remark, that the great exercise used by these volunteer adventurers; their quantity of vegetable food; their freshening their salt provi∣sion, by boiling it in water, and mixing it with flour; their beverage of whey; and their total abstinence from spirituous liquors—are the happy preservatives from the scurvy, which brought all the preceding adventurers, who perished, to their miserable end<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See this subject amply treated by Doctor <HI>Aikin,</HI> in a Treatise on the success, with respect to the health, of some attempts to pass the winter in high northern latitudes.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">HUDSON'S BAY.</NOTE>We now proceed through a nameless streight, between the main land and the two great islands on the east; and, after doubling <HI>Cape Southampton,</HI> enter into <HI>Hudson's Bay,</HI> in the gulph called <HI>the Welcome.</HI> This bay was discovered in 1610, by that able seaman <HI>Henry Hudson,</HI> from whom it takes its name. His view, in the voyage he made, was the discovery of a passage to the <HI>East Indies.</HI> The
<PB N="CLXXXIX" REF="205"/>
trial has been vigorously pursued since his days, but without success. In 1742 an attempt was made, as low as the bottom of <HI>the Welcome,</HI> by Captain <HI>Middleton;</HI> and from the check he met with, he called that part <HI>Repulse Bay.</HI> In subsequent trials <HI>Wager's Water</HI> was suspected to be the passage into the Western ocean; but in 1747 its end was discovered, and found to terminate in two navigable rivers. The romantic scenery which the adventurers met with in the way is most admirably described by the elegant pen of Mr. <HI>Henry Ellis.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Chesterfield,</HI> or <HI>Bowden's Inlet,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">CHESTERFIELD INLET.</NOTE> was likewise suspected to have been the desired streight; but in 1762 Messrs. <HI>Norton</HI> and <HI>Christopher,</HI> in a sloop and cutter be∣longing to the Company, went to the remotest end. At the distance of a hundred and twenty-eight miles from the mouth was scarcely any tide; thirty miles fur∣ther it quite died away. The land here grew contracted into a very narrow passage. Here the adventurers entered with the cutter, and discovered that the end was in a magnificent fresh-water lake, to which was given the name of <HI>Baker</HI>'s. The land was quite level, rich in grass, and abounding with Deer. They found the end quite innavigable, and to terminate in a small stream, with many shoals at its mouth, and three falls across it. After finding the water decrease to the depth of two feet, they returned fully satisfied with their voyage.</P>
<P><HI>Hudson's Bay</HI> has been so frequently described, that I shall only give a general view of it and its adjacent parts. Its entrance from the ocean, after leaving to the north <HI>Cape Farewell</HI> and <HI>Davis's Streights,</HI> is between <HI>Resolution</HI> isles on the north, and <HI>Button's</HI> isles, on the <HI>Labrador</HI> coast, to the south, forming the eastern extre∣mity of the streights distinguished by the name of its great discoverer. The coasts very high, rocky, and rugged at top; in places precipitous; but some∣times exhibit large beaches. The isles of <HI>Salisbury, Nottingham,</HI> and <HI>Digges,</HI> are also very lofty, and naked. The depth of water in the middle of the bay is a hundred and forty fathoms. From <HI>Cape Churchill</HI> to the south end of the bay are regular soundings; near the shore shallow, with muddy or sandy bottom. To the north of <HI>Churchill,</HI> the soundings are irregular, the bottom rocky, and in some parts the rocks appear above the surface at low water. From <HI>Moose</HI> river, or the bottom of the bay, to <HI>Cape Churchill,</HI> the land is flat, marshy, and wooded with Pines, Birch, Larch, and Willows. From <HI>Cape Churchill</HI> to <HI>Wager's Water</HI> the coasts are all high and rocky to the very sea, and woodless, except the mouths of <HI>Pockerekesko,</HI> and <HI>Seal</HI> rivers. The hills on their back are naked, nor are there any trees for a great distance inland.</P>
<P>The mouths of all the rivers are filled with shoals, except that of <HI>Churchill,</HI> in which the largest ships may lie; but ten miles higher, the channel is obstructed with sand-banks; and all the rivers, as far as has been navigated, are full of rapids
<PB N="CXC" REF="206"/>
and cataracts, from ten to sixty feet perpendicular. Down these rivers the <HI>Indian</HI> traders find a quick passage; but their return is a labor of many months.</P>
<P>As far inland as the Company have settlements, which is six hundred miles to the west, at a place called <HI>Hudson House,</HI> lat. 53. long. 106. 27, from <HI>London,</HI> is flat country: nor is it known how far to the eastward the great chain, seen by our navigators from the <HI>Pacific Ocean,</HI> branches off.</P>
<P>The climate,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CLIMATE.</NOTE> even about <HI>Haye</HI>'s river, in only lat. 57, is, during winter, ex∣cessively cold. The snows begin to fall in <HI>October,</HI> and continue falling by in∣tervals the whole winter; and, when the frost is most rigorous, in form of the finest sand. The ice on the rivers is eight feet thick. Port wine freezes into a solid mass; brandy coagulates. The very breath fell on the blankets of the beds in form of a hoar frost, and the bed-cloaths often were found frozen to the wall<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Voy. to Hudson's Bay,</HI> 1746, written by the Clerk of the <HI>California,</HI> i. 159. His name was <HI>Drage;</HI> his account is sensible and entertaining.</NOTE>. The sun rises, in the shortest day, at five minutes past nine, and sets five minutes before three. In the longest day the sun rises at three, and sets about nine. The ice begins to disappear in <HI>May,</HI> and hot weather commences about the middle of <HI>June;</HI> which, at times, is so violent, as to scorch the face of the hunters. Thun∣der is not frequent, but very violent. But there must be great difference of heat and cold in this vast extent, which reaches from lat. 50. 40, to lat. 63, north.</P>
<P>During winter the firmament is not without its beauties. Mock suns and halôs are not infrequent; are very bright, and richly tinged with all the colors of the rainbow. The sun rises and sets with a large cone of yellowish light. The night is enlivened with the <HI>Aurora Borealis,</HI> which spreads a thousand different lights and colors over the whole concave of the sky, not to be defaced even by the splendor of the full moon; and the stars are of a fiery redness<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ellis, <HI>172.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P><HI>Hudson's Bay</HI> is very ill supplied with Fish.<NOTE PLACE="marg">FISH.</NOTE> The common Whale is frequent there. The Company have attempted to establish a fishery; and for that pur∣pose procured experienced people from the <HI>Spitzbergen</HI> ships, and made consi∣derable trials between lat. 61 and 69; but, after expending twenty thousand pounds, and taking only three fish, were, in 1771, obliged to desist. The ice prevent∣ed the vessels from getting to a proper station in due time; and the hard gales, and quick return of winter, always deprived them of an opportunity of making a fair trial. The fishery of the <HI>Beluga,</HI> or White Whale, is attended with more success. It haunts the mouths of rivers in <HI>June,</HI> as soon as they have discharged the ice, and are taken in great numbers. There are two varieties; one with a blue cast, the other of a pure white. These animals, probably, superfete; a

<P>Sturgeons of a small size are sound in the rivers, not far from the sea. They ap∣pear to me to be of the same species with the <HI>English.</HI> Sturgeons are found in great plenty in the lakes far inland, and from the weight of six to forty pounds. I sus∣pect these to be the same with the Sturgeons of the great lakes of <HI>Canada,</HI> which, I am told, are smooth, or free from tubercles; and probably the <HI>Acipenser Huso</HI> of <HI>Linnaeus,</HI> and <HI>Hansen</HI> of the <HI>Germans,</HI> a fish of the <HI>Danube</HI> and <HI>Wolga.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Lophius Piscatorius,</HI> or Common Angler, <HI>Br. Zool.</HI> iii. N<SUP>o</SUP> 51, appears to∣wards the surface only in windy weather; for which reason it is called by the natives <HI>Thutina-meg,</HI> or the <HI>Wind-fish.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Gadus Lota,</HI> or Burbot, <HI>Br. Zool.</HI> ii. N<SUP>o</SUP> 86, is common in the rivers, and is caught with hooks after nine o'clock at night.

<P>The <HI>Omisco Maycus</HI> is a new species of Trout, taken in <HI>May</HI> in <HI>Albany</HI> river, not exceeding four inches and a half long. It has five branchiostegous rays: first dorsal fin has eleven rays, ventral eight, anal seven, pectoral thirteen: tail fork∣ed: in the jaws are minute teeth: back, as low as the lateral line, is of a pale color, marked with two longitudinal rows of black stelliform spots: below the lateral line the color silvery: the belly white.</P>
<P>The Pike, <HI>Br. Zool.</HI> iii. N<SUP>o</SUP> 153, abounds in all the lakes. It by no means arrives at the size of the <HI>English.</HI> Mr. <HI>Hutchins</HI> does not recollect any above the weight of twelve pounds.</P>
<P>The <HI>Cyprinus Catastomus</HI> of Dr. <HI>Forster</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By whom it is well described and figured, in vol. lxiii. p. 155. tab. vi. of <HI>Ph.

They grow to the weight of two pounds and a half. The form is oblong: the head boney, rugged, and decreasing to the tip of the nose: the mouth small, and placed beneath: the body scaly: the tail lunated.</P>
<P>Shell-fish are very scarce in this sea. <HI>Mytilus Edulis,</HI> the Edible Mussel, <HI>Br. Zool.</HI> iv. N<SUP>o</SUP> 73, alone are plentiful; but of Cockles, only the dead shells are seen. From the number of shells which are dug up, for the space of ten miles inland of this flat muddy country, may be collected a proof of the great retreat of the water; but for want of inhabitants, the period of its loss cannot be as∣certained.</P>
<P>Among the birds,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BIRDS.</NOTE> which escaped my notice while I was writing the zoologic part of this Work, are two of the Eagle kind, found in this country: the first is the YELLOW-HEADED, with a dusky bill, cere, and irides: head and neck yellowish: back dark brown; each feather tipped with dirty yellow. This species appears in <HI>Hudson's Bay</HI> in <HI>April.</HI> Builds its nest in trees, with sticks and grass; and

<P>A variety of the GOLDEN EAGLE is also a native of the same place. The forehead is brown: crown and hind part of the neck striped with brown, white, and rusty yellow: lower part of the neck, breast, and belly, deep brown: co∣verts of the wings, back, secondaries, and scapulars, of the same color; the two last white towards their bottoms, and mottled with brown: primaries black: mid∣dle feathers of the tail brown, barred with two or three cinereous bands; exterior feathers brown, blotched with cinereous: legs cloathed with pale brown fea∣thers to the toes, which are yellow. Length three feet. A specimen of this was presented to the <HI>British Museum.</HI></P>
<P>To these may be added a genuine Falcon, communicated to me by Mr. <HI>Latham.</HI> The bill very sharp, and furnished with a large and pointed process in the upper mandible: cere yellowish: head, front of the neck, breast, and belly, white: each feather marked along the shaft with a line of brown, narrowest on the head: the back and coverts of the wings of a dirty bluish ash-color; the edges of the feathers whitish, and many of them tipped with the same: primaries dusky; ex∣terior webs blotched with white; interior barred with the same color: tail of the same color with the back, barred with white; but the bars do not reach the shaft, and, like those in the <HI>Iceland</HI> Falcon, oppose the dark bars in the adverse web: the legs bluish. The length of this fine species is two feet two inches.</P>
<P>Multitudes of birds retire to this remote country, to <HI>Labrador,</HI> and <HI>New∣foundland,</HI> from places most remotely south, perhaps from the <HI>Antilles;</HI> and some even of the most delicate little species. Most of them, with numbers of aquatic fowls, are seen returning southward, with their young broods, to more favorable climates. The savages, in some respects, regulate their months by the appearance of birds; and have their <HI>Goose month</HI> from the vernal appearance of Geese from the south. All the Grous kind, Ravens, cinereous Crows, Titmouse, and <HI>Lapland</HI> Finch, brave the severest winter; and several of the Falcons and Owls seek shelter in the woods. The Rein Deer pass in vast herds towards the north, in <HI>October,</HI> seeking the extreme cold. The male Polar Bears rove out at sea, on the floating ice, most of the winter, and till <HI>June:</HI> the females lie concealed in the woods, or beneath the banks of rivers, till <HI>March,</HI> when they come abroad with their twin cubs, and bend their course to the sea in search of their consorts. Several are killed in their passage; and those which are wounded shew vast fury, roar hide∣ously, and bite and throw up into the air even their own progeny. The females and the young, when not interrupted, continue their way to sea. In <HI>June,</HI> the
<PB N="CXCIV" REF="210"/>
males return to shore, and, by <HI>August,</HI> are joined by their consorts, with the cubs, by that time of a considerable size<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See an ingenious and laudable Calendar of <HI>Hudson's Bay,</HI> published by Doctor <HI>Macfait,</HI> in his new System of General Geography, 348 to 354.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The eastern boundary of the bay is <HI>Terra de Labrador;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">TERRA DE LA∣BRADOR.</NOTE> the northern part has a strait coast facing the bay, guarded with a line of isles innumerable. A vast bay, called the <HI>Archiwinnipy Sea,</HI> lies within it, and opens into <HI>Hudson's Bay</HI> by means of <HI>Gulph Hazard,</HI> through which the <HI>Beluga</HI> Whales dart in great numbers. Here the Company had a settlement, for the sake of the fishery, and for trading with the Eskimaux; but deserted it as unprofitable about the year 1758 or 1759. The eastern coast, so admirably described by that ho∣nored name, Sir ROGER CURTIS<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ph. Trans.</HI> lxiv. 372.</NOTE>! is barren past the efforts of cultivation. The surface every where uneven, and covered with masses of stone of an amazing size. It is a country of fruitless vallies and frightful mountains, some of an astonishing height: the first watered by a chain of lakes, formed not from springs but rain and snow, so chilly as to be productive of only a few small Trout. The mountains have here and there a blighted shrub, or a little moss. The vallies are full of crooked stunted trees, Pines, Fir, Birch, and Cedars, or rather a species of Juniper. In lat. 60, on this coast, vegetation ceases. The whole shore, like that on the west, is faced with islands at some distance from land. The inha∣bitants among the mountains are <HI>Indians;</HI> along the coasts, <HI>Eskimaux.</HI> The Dogs of the former are very small; of the latter, large, and headed like a Fox. Notwithstanding they have Rein-deer, they never train them for the sledge; but apply the Dogs to that use<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Same, 386.</NOTE>. <HI>Walruses</HI> visit a place called <HI>Nuchvûnk,</HI> in lat. 60, during winter; from thence they purchase the teeth, with which they head their darts. <HI>Davis</HI> suspected that he had found a passage on this coast, in 1586, to the Western ocean; but it proves no more than a deep bay.</P>
<P>The laudable zeal of the <HI>Moravian</HI> clergy hath induced them to send, in the year 1752, missionaries from <HI>Greenland</HI> to this country. They fixed on <HI>Nisbet</HI>'s harbour for their settlement; but the first party was partly killed, partly driven away. In 1764, under the protection of our government, another attempt was made. The missionaries were well received by the <HI>Eskimaux,</HI> and the mission goes on with success<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Crantz, Hist. Morav. <HI>404, 608.</HI></NOTE>. These pious people, like the Jesuits, have penetrated almost into every part of the known world; and, for the sake of the Gospel, dared the extremities of heat and cold. They endeavour to humanize the savages of <HI>Greenland,</HI> and improve the morals of the soft inhabitants of the unwholesome coasts of <HI>Bengal.</HI> They are not actuated by ambition, political views, or ava∣rice.

<P>In the gulph are scattered several important islands,<NOTE PLACE="marg">MAGDALENE ISLES.</NOTE> occupied by the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>French</HI> for the sake of the fisheries.

The water round the <HI>Magdalenes</HI> is only from three to nine fathoms deep, and the shores slope most conveniently into it for the ascent or descent of these animals. The water round the other isles is of one depth, except on the north side of St. <HI>John</HI>'s.</P>
<P><HI>Newfoundland</HI> (a name, in the infancy of discovery, common to all <HI>North Ame∣rica</HI>) was discovered in 1496, by the celebrated <HI>Venetians, Sebastian Cabot</HI> and his three sons; who, at their own charges, under a grant of <HI>Henry</HI> VII. giving them possession (as vassals of his) of all lands they might discover<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Rymer's Foed.</NOTE>, coasted from lat. 67. 30, to the capes of <HI>Florida,</HI> and thus indisputably gave to ill-fated <HI>Britain</HI> the right, by pre-discovery, of the whole continent of <HI>North America.</HI> The short-sighted avaricious prince, under whose banners it was discovered, had not the heart to make the proper advantage. He had before neglected the offer of <HI>Co∣lumbus,</HI> which would have given him that species of right to the whole New World. 'But,' says the courtier-like <HI>Bacon</HI><NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Hist.

Of all minerals (twice says the same noble philosopher) there
<PB N="CXCVI" REF="212"/>
is none like the fisheries. In 1534 they were actually engaged in them. A pri∣vate man, Sir <HI>Humphry Gilbert,</HI> brother-in-law to RALEIGH, or, what was bet∣ter, animated by a congenial soul, sailed in 1583 with every provision for settling this important colony. On his return he was swallowed up by the ocean. His love of improvement, and his piety, never forsook him. He was seen sitting unmoved in the stern of his ship, with a book in his hand; and often heard to say, 'Courage, my lads! we are as near heaven at sea as at land<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hackluyt, <HI>iii. 159.</HI></NOTE>.'</P>
<P>The isle of <HI>Newfoundland</HI> is of a triangular form, and lies between lat. 46. 40, and 51. 30: visited occasionally, but not inhabited, by savages from the continent.</P>
<P>The boasted mine of this island lies on the southern and western sides, on the great bank, which stretches from north-east to south-west, about two hundred leagues. The water on the bank is from twenty-two to fifty fathoms; on the outside from sixty to eighty; on the lesser banks much the same. A great swell and thick fog generally mark the place of the greater. The subject of the fishery has been often treated of; but the following short though clear account of so interesting a subject cannot fail being acceptable to the <HI>British</HI> reader.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">NEWFOUNDLAND FISHERY.</NOTE>"The boats or shallops are forty feet in the keel, rigged with a mainmast and foremast, and lugsails; furnished with four oars, three of which row on one side, and the other (which is twice as large) <HI>belays</HI> the other three, by being rowed sideways over the stern, by a man who stands up for that purpose, with his face towards the rowers, counteracting them, and steering at the same time as he gives way to the boat.</P>
<P>"Each of the men in this boat is furnished with two lines, one at each side of the boat, each furnished with two hooks; so here are sixteen hooks constantly em∣ployed; which are thought to make a tolerable good day's work of it, if they bring in from five to ten quintals of fish, though they have stowage for, and sometimes bring in thirty. Two hundred quintals is called a saving voyage; but not under. The bait is small fish of all kinds; Herring, Capelin, Lance, Tom Cod, or young Cod; the first of which they salt, and keep for some time, in case of scarcity of the rest; but these are not near so eagerly taken by the fish when salted. In case small fish cannot be got, they use sea-fowl, which are easily taken in vast numbers, by laying nets over the holes in the rocks where they come to roost in the night. If neither small fish nor birds are to be got, they are forced to use the maws of fish they catch, which is the worst bait of any.</P>
<P>"When the fish are taken, they are carried to the stage, which is built with one end over the water for the conveniency of throwing the offals into the sea, and
<PB N="CXCVII" REF="213"/>
for their boats being able to come close to discharge their fish. As soon as they come on the stage a boy hands them to the header, who stands at the side of a table next the water end; whose business it is to gut the fish and cut off the head, which he does by pressing the back of the head against the side of the table, which is made sharp for that purpose; when both head and guts fall through a hole in the floor into the water. He then shoves the fish to the splitter, who stands opposite to him; his business is to split the fish, beginning at the head, and open∣ing it down to the tail; at the next cut he takes out the larger part of the back-bone, which falls through the floor into the water. He then shoves the fish off the table, which drops into a kind of hand-barrow, which, as soon as filled, is car∣ried off to the salt-pile. The header also flings the liver into a separate basket, for the making of train-oil, used by the curriers, which bears a higher price than Whale-oil.</P>
<P>"In the salt pile, the fish are spread upon one another, with a layer of salt between. Thus they remain till they have taken salt; and then are carried, and the salt is washed from them by throwing them off from shore in a kind of float called a <HI>Pound.</HI> As soon as this is completed, they are carried to the last operation, of drying them; which is done on standing flakes made by a slight wattle, just strong enough to support the men who lay on the fish, supported by poles, in some places as high as twenty feet from the ground: here they are exposed, with the open side to the sun; and every night, when it is bad weather, piled up five or six on a heap, with a large one, his back or skinny part uppermost, to be a shel∣ter to the rest from rain, which hardly damages him through his skin, as he rests slanting each way to shoot it off. When they are tolerably dry, which in good weather is in a week's time, they are put in round piles of eight or ten quin∣tals each, covering them on the top with bark. In these piles they remain three or four days to sweat; after which they are again spread, and when dry put into larger heaps, covered with canvas, and left till they are put on board.</P>
<P>"Thus prepared, they are sent to the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> where they fetch a good price; but are not esteemed in <HI>England:</HI> for which place another kind of fish is prepared, called by them Mud Fish; which, instead of being split quite open, like their dry fish, are only opened down to the navel. They are salted, and lie in salt, which is washed out of them in the same manner with the others; but instead of being laid out to dry, are barrelled up in a pickle of salt boiled in water.</P>
<P>"The train-oil is made from the livers: it is called so to distinguish it from Whale or Seal oil, which they call fat oil, and is sold at a lower price (being only
<PB N="CXCVIII" REF="214"/>
used for lighting of lamps) than the train-oil, which is used by the curriers. It is thus made:—They take a half tub, and, boring a hole through the bottom, press hard down into it a layer of spruce boughs; upon which they place the livers; and expose the whole apparatus to as sunny a place as possible. As the livers cor∣rupt the oil runs from them, and, straining itself clear through the spruce boughs, is caught in a vessel set under the hole in the tub's bottom."</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">CAPE BRETON.</NOTE>The barren island of <HI>Cape Breton</HI> forms one side of the great entrance into the gulph of St. <HI>Laurence.</HI> It is high, rocky, and dreary: rich in thick beds of coal, and may prove the <HI>Newcastle</HI> of <HI>America.</HI> This isle was first discovered by Sir <HI>Humphry Gilbert,</HI> in his fatal voyage. It was soon after frequented, on account of the Walruses, and the fishery of Whales. Among the earliest adventurers were the industrious <HI>Biscayeners,</HI> who seem to have been our masters in the art. Till of late years, it had been important by being the seat of the <HI>French</HI> fishery; but the strong fortress of <HI>Louisbourg</HI> is now demolished, and the place deserted.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">NOVA SCOTIA.</NOTE>The great peninsula of <HI>Nova Scotia</HI> is separated from <HI>Cape Breton</HI> by a narrow streight. It was, in 1616, possessed by the <HI>French,</HI> who attempted to colonize it from their new settlement in <HI>Canada;</HI> but they were soon expelled by the <HI>English,</HI> who deemed it part of <HI>North Virginia;</HI> the whole continent, at that time, going under the name of <HI>Virginia,</HI> so called, originally, in honor of our virgin queen. The <HI>French</HI> had given it the name of <HI>Acadie. James</HI> I. made a grant of the country to Sir <HI>William Alexander</HI> in 1621, on condition that he would form there a settle∣ment. It then received the title of <HI>Nova Scotia.</HI> In order to encourage Sir <HI>Wil∣liam,</HI> he planned the order of baronets, which is called after the country. To every knight who would engage to colonize any part, a grant was to be made of certain portions of land. The order was not instituted till 1625, when a number were created, and they held their lands from the crown of <HI>Scotland</HI> as a free barony, with great privileges to all who would settle in the country<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Collins's Baronets, <HI>iv. 330.</HI></NOTE>. The design almost instantly failed, and the <HI>French</HI> were permitted to repossess themselves of the pro∣vince. Its value became known, and since that period it has frequently changed masters. It never was effectually settled till the year 1749, when a large colony was sent there under the auspices of the Earl of <HI>Halifax.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">CLIMATE.</NOTE>The climate of this province is, during the long winter, extremely severe, and the country covered with snow many months: the summer misty and damp. The face of it is in general hilly; but can scarcely be called moun∣tanous,
<PB N="CXCIX" REF="215"/>
being the lowered continuation of the great chain which pervades the whole continent. The ground is not favorable to agriculture, but may prove excellent for pasturage. Due attention to the breeding of cattle will not only repay the industry of the farmer, by the home consumption, but be an exten∣sive benefit to our islands. The country cannot boast, amidst its vast forests, timber fit for large masts, nor yet for the building of large ships; yet it will prove an inexhaustible magazine for that species of timber called lumber, so essential to our sugar plantations.</P>
<P>Its situation, in respect to the fisheries,<NOTE PLACE="marg">ITS FISHERIES.</NOTE> is scarcely inferior to that of <HI>Newfoundland.</HI> The vast banks, called <HI>Sable Island</HI>'s, <HI>Brown</HI>'s, and <HI>St. George</HI>'s, with many others, are frequented by myriads of Cod-fish. It is the duty of the Parent State to encourage, with all diligence, this branch of commerce; and in a manner so expeditious and so frugal, as may anticipate and under∣sell foreign adventurers. Without that, our remnants of the New World will be but of little use. The fisheries, the staples of <HI>Nova Scotia</HI> and <HI>Newfound∣land,</HI> are open to other nations; and if they are permitted to excel us in the articles expedition and frugality, our labors are truly vain. It is to the antient hardy colonists we must look up for the support of the toils of the sea, and the advantages we may expect to gain from them: they should have their encouragement. But there is another set of men who of late (a public calamity) have made hither an involuntary migration, who with sad hearts recollect their exiled land:
<Q><L>Nos Patriae fines, nos dulcia linquimus arva:</L>
<L>Nos Patriam fugimus.</L></Q>
These sufferers are in general unused to the fatigues of a maritime life, and ought to be fostered, for their filial piety, at first, with a parental care; to be encouraged in the pastoral life, or in such arts as may supply the sailor and the fisherman with food, and with materials for their professions. If the climate is fit for corn, for flax and hemp, let due rewards be given for the suc∣cessful efforts of their industry. The succeeding generation, hardened to the climate, and early habituated to another kind of life, may join the maritime adventurers, and give importance to themselves, and strength to the island from which they sprung.</P>
<P>The harbours of this province are frequent and excellent.<NOTE PLACE="marg">HARBOURS.</NOTE> The tides are in many places most uncommonly high. Those of the bay of <HI>Fundy</HI> are the most re∣markable; for they force themselves into the great creeks with a bore or head
<PB REF="216"/>
from fifty to seventy-two feet high, and with most amazing rapidity. Hogs, which feed along the shores, are much more sensible of its approach than mankind: they are observed to listen, to prick up their ears for some time, and then suddenly to run off at full speed.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">MAGNIFICENT VIEWS.</NOTE>The coasts are, in general, rude and rocky, with some variations; but in many places exhibit most picturesque scenery. All the northern side is high, red, and rocky. The isles of <HI>Canso</HI> are varied with many low white rocks. From them to <HI>Torbay</HI> is a series of lofty coast, broken and white. <HI>Beaver Harbour</HI> is guarded by most picturesque rounded isles. South shore of <HI>Chebucto</HI> steep: the plaister cliffs in <HI>George Bay</HI> are remarkable for their precipitous face and white∣ness. <HI>Sable</HI> or <HI>Sand Island</HI> is distinguished (as the name imports) by amazing sand-hills of a sugar-loaf form. The isle of <HI>Great Manan,</HI> on the western side of the entrance of the bay of <HI>Fundy,</HI> is very lofty, the strata divided, and the top wooded. <HI>St. Mary's Bay</HI> is nobly bounded by high rocks, cloathed on their summits with woods: the entrance into it are the <HI>Grand</HI> and <HI>Petit Passage;</HI> the sides of the last are either covered with hanging woods, sloping to the water-edge, or broke into short precipices. The entrance into the fine harbour of <HI>Annapolis</HI> is most august: a narrow gut, bounded by enormous precipices, with lofty hills soaring above, the tops of which are even and cloathed with woods. The approach to the bason of <HI>Minas</HI> is not less magnificent. The columnar rocks of <HI>Cape Split</HI> are very singular. The isle of <HI>Haute</HI> is lofty and steep on every side. The whole neighborhood abounds with views of the most sublime and romantic cast. This peninsula joins the great continent by a very narrow isthmus, beyond which we retain a wretched barren remnant of near half of the New World; the sad reverse of the short space of twenty years!—My eyes withdraw themselves from the mortifying sight. BRITAIN, which sate (by the wisdom of one man) as the Queen of Nations, now deplores her folly; and ought to confess, that <Q>those things which were for her wealth, proved to her an occasion of falling.</Q> She sunk under the delusion of prosperity, by false security, and the pride of victories. If she makes a proper use of adversity, she still may rise into glory and wealth, by honest industry, and by the repression of rapacity and sordid ambition.—Once more, gracious Heaven, endeavour to save an ungrateful people! once more raise up some great instrument to execute thy mercies!—Pour with full measure into our youthful Minister the virtues of his father!—Emulate, young Man, his virtues, and then—

<P>OX. With short, black, rounded horns; with a great space between their bases: on the shoulders a vast bunch, composed of a fleshy substance, much elevated: the fore part of the body thick and strong: the hind part slender and weak: tail a foot long, naked to the end, which is tufted: the legs short and thick.</P>
<P>The head and shoulders of the BULL are covered with very long flocks of reddish woolly hair, falling over the eyes and horns, leaving only the points of the latter to be seen: on the chin, and along the dewlaps, is a great length of shaggy hairs: the rest of the body during summer is naked, in winter is cloathed equally in all parts. The Cow is lesser, and wants the shaggy coat, which gives the Bull so tremendous an aspect.</P>
<P>It grows to a great size,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SIZE.</NOTE> even to the weight of sixteen hundred or two thousand four hundred pounds<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Lawson, <HI>116.</HI></NOTE>.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">WHERE AT PRESENT.</NOTE>In these times it is found in very few places in a state of nature; it is, as far as we know, an inhabitant at present only of the forests of <HI>Lithuania,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">EUROPE.</NOTE> and among the <HI>Carpathian</HI> mountains, within the extent of the great <HI>Hercynian</HI> wood<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">There is a very fine figure of the <HI>European Bison</HI> in Mr. <HI>Ridinger's Jagbere Thiere.</HI></NOTE>, its antient haunts; and in <HI>Asia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">ASIA.</NOTE> among the vast mountains of <HI>Caucasus.</HI></P>
<P>It is difficult to say in what manner these animals migrated ori∣ginally from the old to the new world; it is most likely it was from the north of <HI>Asia,</HI> which in very antient times might have been stocked with them to its most extreme parts, notwithstanding they are now extinct. At that period there is a probability that the old and the new continents might have been united in the narrow chan∣nel between <HI>Tchutki noss</HI> and the opposite headlands of <HI>America;</HI>
<PB N="3" REF="224"/>
and the many islands off of that promontory, with the <HI>Aleutian</HI> or <HI>New Fox</HI> islands, somewhat more distant, stretching very near to <HI>Ame∣rica,</HI> may with great reason be supposed to be fragments of land which joined the two continents, and formed into their insular state by the mighty convulsion which divided <HI>Asia</HI> from <HI>America. Spain</HI> was probably thus disjoined from <HI>Africa; Britain</HI> from <HI>France; Ice∣land</HI> from <HI>Greenland; Spitzbergen</HI> from <HI>Lapland.</HI></P>
<P>But that they passed from <HI>Asia</HI> to <HI>America</HI> is far the more probable, than that they stocked the new world from the side of <HI>Europe,</HI> not only on account of the present narrowness of the streight between the two continents, which gives a greater cause to suppose them to have been once joined; but that we are now arrived at a certainty, that these animals in antient days were natives of <HI>Sibiria:</HI> the sculls, with the horns affixed, of a size far superior to any known at this time, have been found fossil not only on the banks of the <HI>Ilga,</HI> which falls into the <HI>Lena,</HI> but even in those of the <HI>Anadyr,</HI> the most eastern of the <HI>Sibirian</HI> rivers, and which disembogues north of <HI>Kamtschatka</HI> into those streights: similar skulls and horns have been discovered near <HI>Dirschau,</HI> in <HI>Poland,</HI> also of a gigantic magnitude; and in my opinion of the same species with the modern Bisons<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Nov.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">TIMID.</NOTE>They are exceedingly shy; and very fearful of man, unless they are wounded, when they pursue their enemy, and become very dangerous.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">CHASE.</NOTE>The chase of these animals is a favorite diversion of the <HI>Indians:</HI> it is effected in two ways; first, by shooting; when the marksman must take great care to go against the wind, for their smell is so ex∣quisite that the moment they get scent of him they instantly retire with the utmost precipitation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Du Pratz,</HI> i. 49. ii. 227.</NOTE>. He aims at their shoulders, that they may drop at once, and not be irritated by an ineffectual wound. Pro∣vided the wind does not favor the beasts, they may be approached very near,<NOTE PLACE="marg">ANOTHER METHOD.</NOTE> being blinded by the hair which covers their eyes. The other method is performed by a great number of men, who divide and form a vast square: each band sets fire to the dry grass of the savanna where the herds are feeding; these animals have a great dread of fire, which they see approach on all sides; they retire from it to the center of the square<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Charlevoix, N. France, <HI>v. 192.</HI></NOTE>; the bands close, and kill them (pressed toge∣ther in heaps) without the lest hazard. It is pretended, that on every expedition of this nature, they kill fifteen hundred or two thousand beeves.</P>
<P>The hunting-grounds are prescribed with great form, least the dif∣ferent bands should meet, and interfere in the diversion. Penalties are enacted on such who infringe the regulations, as well as on those who quit their posts, and suffer the beasts to escape from the hollow squares; the punishments are, the stripping the delinquents, the taking away their arms (which is the greatest disgrace a savage can undergo), or lastly, the demolition of their cabins<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Charlevoix, <HI>v. 192.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="226"/>The uses of these animals are various.<NOTE PLACE="marg">USES.</NOTE> Powder-flasks are made of their horns.

When dressed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SKIN.</NOTE> they form an excellent buff; the <HI>Indians</HI> dress them with the hair on, and cloath themselves with them; the <HI>Europeans</HI> of <HI>Louisiana</HI> use them for blankets, and find them light, warm, and soft. The flesh is a considerable article of food, and the bunch on the back is esteemed a very great delicacy. The Bulls become excessively fat, and yield great quantity of tallow,<NOTE PLACE="marg">TALLOW.</NOTE> a hundred and fifty pounds weight has been got from a single beast<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Du Pratz.</NOTE>, which forms a considerable matter of commerce. These over-fed animals usually become the prey of Wolves; for, by reason of their great unwieldiness, they cannot keep up with the herd.</P>
<P>The <HI>Indians,</HI> by a very bad policy, prefer the flesh of the Cows; which in time will destroy the species: they complain of the rank∣ness of that of the Bulls; but <HI>Du Pratz</HI> thinks the last much more tender, and that the rankness might be prevented, by cutting off the testicles as soon as the beast is killed.</P>
<P>The hair or wool is spun into cloth, gloves, stockings,<NOTE PLACE="marg">HAIR.</NOTE> and gar∣ters, which are very strong, and look as well as those made of the best sheeps wool; Governor <HI>Pownall</HI> assures us, that the most luxu∣rious fabrick might be made of it<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Topeg.

<P>Their sagacity in defending themselves against the attacks of Wolves is admirable:<NOTE PLACE="marg">DEFENCE AGAINST WOLVES.</NOTE> when they scent the approach of a drove of those ravenous creatures, the herd flings itself into the form of a circle: the weakest keep in the middle, the strongest are ranged on the outside, presenting to the enemy an impenetrable front of horns: should they be taken by surprize, and have recourse to flight, numbers of the fattest or the weakest are sure to perish<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Du Pratz, <HI>i. 288.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="227"/><NOTE PLACE="marg">HARD TO BE TAMED.</NOTE>Attempts have been made to tame and domesticate the wild, by catching the calves and bringing them up with the common kind, in hopes of improving the breed. It has not yet been found to an∣swer: notwithstanding they had the appearance for a time of having lost their savage nature, yet they always grew impatient of restraint, and, by reason of their great strength, would break down the strongest inclosure, and entice the tame cattle into the corn-fields. They have been known to engender together, and to breed; but I cannot learn whether the species was meliorated <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Kalm,</HI> i. 207.</NOTE> by the intercourse: probably perseverance in continuing the crosses is only wanted to effect their thorough domestication; as it is notorious that the <HI>Bisons</HI> of the old world were the original stock of all our tame cattle.</P>
<P>These were the only animals which had any affinity to the <HI>Euro∣pean</HI> cattle on the first discovery of the new world: before that pe∣riod, it was in possession of neither Horse nor Ass, Cow nor Sheep, Hog, Goat, nor yet that faithful animal the Dog. Mankind were here in a state of nature; their own passions unsubdued, they never thought of conquering those of the brute creation, and rendering them subservient to their will. The few animals which they had congenerous to those mentioned, might possibly by industry have been reclamed. This animal might have been brought to all the uses of the <HI>European</HI> Cow; the <HI>Pecari</HI> might have been substituted for the Hog; the Fox or Wolf for the Dog: but the natives, living wholly by chase, were at war with the animal creation, and neglected the cultivation of any part, except the last, which was imperfectly tamed.</P>
<P>Such is the case even to the present hour; for neither the example of the <HI>Europeans,</HI> nor the visible advantages which result from an at∣tention to that useful animal the Cow, can induce the <HI>Indian</HI> to pay any respect to it. He contemns every species of domestic labour, except what is necessary for forming a provision of bread. Every

wigwam or village has its plantation of <HI>Mayz,</HI> or <HI>Indian</HI> corn, and on that is his great dependence, should the chase prove unsuccessful.</P>
<P>Domesticated cattle are capable of enduring very rigorous cli∣mates; Cows are kept at <HI>Quickjock</HI> in <HI>Lecha Lapmark,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">LAPMARK.</NOTE> not far from the arctic circle; but they do not breed there, the succession being preserved by importation: yet in <HI>Iceland,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">ICELAND.</NOTE> a small portion of which is within the circle, cattle abound, and breed as in more southern latitudes: they are generally fed with hay, as in other places; but where there is scarcity of fodder, they are fed with the fish called the Sea-Wolf, and the heads and bones of Cod beaten small, and mixed with one quarter of chopped hay: the cattle are fond of it, and, what is wonderful, yield a considerable quantity of milk. It need not be said that the milk is bad.</P>

Of the tail, the <HI>Eskimaux</HI> of the north-west side of the bay make a cap of a most hor∣rible appearance; for the hairs fall all round their head, and cover their faces; yet it is of singular service in keeping off the Musque∣toes, which would otherwise be intolerable<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ellis's voy. <HI>232.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>Space between the horns nine inches:<NOTE PLACE="marg">HORNS.</NOTE> the horns are placed exactly on the sides of the head; are whitish; thirteen inches and a half long; eight inches and a half round at the base; of the same sort of curvature with those of the Bull: the ears are three inches long,<NOTE PLACE="marg">EARS.</NOTE> quite erect; sharp-pointed, but dilate much in the middle; are thickly lined with hair of a dusky color, marked with a stripe of white.</P>
<P>The color of the hair black, except on these parts:<NOTE PLACE="marg">COLOR.</NOTE>—from the base of one horn to that of the other, is a bed of white and light rust-co∣lored hair: the mane is dusky, tinged with red, which is continued in a narrow form to the middle of the back; on which is a large roundish bed of pure white, and the hairs in that space shorter than any of the rest, not exceeding three inches in length, and of a pale brown to∣wards their roots.</P>
<P>The hairs are of two kinds, the longest measure seventeen inches;<NOTE PLACE="marg">HAIR.</NOTE> are very fine and glossy, and when examined appear quite flat: this is the black part, which cloaths most part of the animal.</P>
<P>The bed of hair between the horns, and that which runs along the top of the neck, is far finer and softer than any human hair, and ap∣pears quite round. The white bed is still finer, and approaches to the nature of wool.</P>
<P>Beneath every part of the hair grows in great plenty,<NOTE PLACE="marg">WOOL.</NOTE> and often in flocks, an ash-colored wool, most exquisitely fine, superior, I think,

to any I have seen, and which might be very useful in manufactures if sufficient could be procured. I give full credit to <HI>M. Jeremie,</HI> who says, that he brought some of the wool to <HI>France,</HI> and got stockings made with it, more beautiful than those of silk<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Voy. au Nord, <HI>iii. 314.</HI></NOTE>.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">SIZE.</NOTE>The length of the whole hide, from nose to tail, is about six feet four inches: of the head alone fourteen inches. The legs could not be well measured, but were little more than a foot long.</P>

<P>THE Sheep, in its wild state, inhabits the north-east of <HI>Asia,</HI> beyond lake <HI>Baikal,</HI> between the <HI>Onon</HI> and <HI>Argun,</HI> to the height of latitude 60, on the east of the <HI>Lena,</HI> and from thence to <HI>Kamtschatka,</HI> and perhaps the <HI>Kurili</HI> islands. I dare not pronounce that they extend to the continent of <HI>America;</HI> yet I have received from Doctor <HI>Pallas</HI> a fringe of very fine twisted wool, which had or∣namented a dress from the isle of <HI>Kadjak;</HI> and I have myself another piece from the habit of the <HI>Americans</HI> in latitude 50. The first was of a snowy whiteness, and of unparalleled fineness; the other as fine, but of a pale brown color: the first appeared to be the wool which grows intermixed with the hairs of the <HI>Argali;</HI> the last, that which is found beneath those of the Musk Ox. Each of these animals may exist on that side of the continent, notwithstanding they might have not fallen within the reach of the navigators in their short stay off the coast.</P>
<P>Certain quadrupeds of this genus were observed in <HI>California</HI> by the missionaries in 1697; one as large as a Calf of one or two years old, with a head like a Stag, and horns like a Ram: the tail and hair speckled, and shorter than a Stag's. A second kind was larger, and varied in color; some being white, others black, and furnished
<PB N="13" REF="235"/>
with very good wool. The Fathers called both Sheep, from their great resemblance to them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ph. Trans. abr.</HI> v. part ii. 195.</NOTE>. Either the <HI>Americans</HI> of latitude 50 are pos∣sessed of these animals, or may obtain the fleeces by commerce from the southern <HI>Indians.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Argali</HI> abound in <HI>Kamtschatka;</HI> they are the most useful of their animals, for they contribute to food and cloathing. The <HI>Kamtschatkans</HI> cloath themselves with the skins, and esteem the flesh, especially the fat, diet fit for the Gods.<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHASE IN KAMTSCHATKA.</NOTE> There is no labor which they will not undergo in the chase. They abandon their habitations, with all their family, in the spring, and continue the whole summer in the employ, amidst the rude mountains, fearless of the dreadful precipices, or of the <HI>avelenches,</HI> which often overwhelm the eager sportsmen.</P>
<P>These animals are shot with guns or with arrows; sometimes with cross-bows, which are placed in the paths, and discharged by means of a string whenever the <HI>Argali</HI> happens to tread on it. They are often chased with dogs, not that they are overtaken by them; but when they are driven to the lofty summits, they will often stand and look as if it were with contempt on the dogs below, which gives the hunter an opportunity of creeping within reach while they are so engaged; for they are the shyest of animals.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mongols</HI> and <HI>Tungusi</HI> use a nobler species of chase:<NOTE PLACE="marg">IN MONGOLIA.</NOTE> they col∣lect together a vast multitude of horses and dogs, attempting to sur∣round them on a sudden; for such is their swiftness and cunning, that if they perceive, either by sight or smell, the approach of the <HI>chasseurs,</HI> they instantly take to flight, and secure themselves on the lofty and inaccessible summits.</P>
<P>Domesticated Sheep will live even in the dreadful climate of <HI>Greenland.</HI> Mr. <HI>Fabricius</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Faun.

They are particularly fond of scurvy-grass, with which they grow so fat as to yield more than twenty pounds. The ewes give from two to six quarts of milk a day, of which butter and cheese is made. The wool is never shorn, but left on till the end of <HI>May,</HI> when it grows loose, and is stripped entirely off in one fleece; and a fine, short, and new wool appears to have grown be∣neath; this continues growing all summer, becomes smooth and glossy like the hair of Camels, but more shaggy<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Troil's voy. <HI>138.</HI></NOTE>.

<P>In all parts of <HI>European Russia</HI> are found the common Sheep.

<P>DEER. With horns with short beams, spreading into a broad palm, furnished on the outward side with sharp snags; the inner side plain: no brow antlers: small eyes: long slouching asinine ears: nostrils large: upper lip square, great, and hanging far over the lower; has a deep furrow in the middle, so as to appear almost bifid: under the throat a small excrescence, with a long tuft of coarse black hair pendent from it: neck shorter than the head; along the top an upright, short, thick, mane: withers elevated: tail short: legs long; the hind legs the shortest: hoofs much cloven.</P>
<P>Color of the mane a light brown;<NOTE PLACE="marg">COLOR.</NOTE> of the body in general a hoary brown: tail dusky above; white beneath. The vast size of the head, the shortness of the neck, and the length of the ears, give the beast a deformed and stupid look.</P>
<P>The greatest height of this animal, which I have heard of,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SIZE.</NOTE> is seven∣teen hands; the greatest weight 1229 pounds.</P>

<P>The female is lesser than the male, and wants horns.</P>
<P>Inhabits the isle of <HI>Cape Breton, Nova Scotia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">PLACE.</NOTE> and the western side of the Bay of <HI>Fundy; Canada,</HI> and the country round the great lakes, almost as far south as the river <HI>Ohio</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Du Pratz, <HI>i. 301.</HI></NOTE>.

<P><PB N="18" REF="241"/><NOTE PLACE="marg">NAME.</NOTE>The Elk and the Moose are the same species; the last derived from <HI>Musu,</HI> which in the <HI>Algonkin</HI> language signifies that animal<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Kalm,</HI> i. 298. iii. 204.</NOTE>. The <HI>English</HI> used to call it the Black Moose, to distinguish it from the Stag, which they named the Grey Moose<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mr. Dudley's Phil. Trans. Abridg. <HI>vii. 447.</HI></NOTE>. The <HI>French</HI> call it <HI>L'Orignal.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">RESIDENCE AND FOOD.</NOTE>These animals reside amidst forests, for the conveniency of brousing the boughs of trees, because they are prevented from grazing with any kind of ease, by reason of the shortness of their necks and length of their legs. They often have recourse to water-plants, which they can readily get at by wading. <HI>M. Sarrasin</HI> says, that they are very fond of the <HI>anagyris foetida,</HI> or stinking bean trefoil, and will un∣cover the snow with their feet in order to get at it.</P>
<P>In passing through the woods, they raise their heads to a horizon∣tal position, to prevent their horns from being entangled in the branches.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">GAIT.</NOTE>They have a singular gait: their pace is a shambling trot, but they go with great swiftness. In their common walk they lift their feet very high, and will without any difficulty step over a gate five feet high.</P>
<P>They feed principally in the night. If they graze, it is always against an ascent;<NOTE PLACE="marg">RUMINATE.</NOTE> an advantage they use for the reason above assigned. They ruminate like the Ox.</P>
<P>They go to rut in autumn; are at that time very furious, seeking the female by swimming from isle to isle.<NOTE PLACE="marg">YOUNG.</NOTE> They bring two young at a birth, in the month of <HI>April,</HI> which follow the dam a whole year. During the summer they keep in families. In deep snows they col∣lect in numbers in the forests of pines, for protection from the incle∣mency of the weather under the shelter of those ever-greens.</P>
<P>They are very inoffensive, except in the rutting-season; or except they are wounded, when they will turn on the assailant, and attack
<PB N="19" REF="242"/>
him with their horns, or trample him to death beneath their great hoofs.</P>
<P>Their flesh is extremely sweet and nourishing. The <HI>Indians</HI> say,<NOTE PLACE="marg">FLESH.</NOTE> that they can travel three times as far after a meal of Moose, as after any other animal food. The tongues are excellent, but the nose is perfect marrow, and esteemed the greatest delicacy in all <HI>Canada.</HI></P>
<P>The skin makes excellent buff; is strong, soft, and light.<NOTE PLACE="marg">SKIN.</NOTE> The <HI>Indians</HI> dress the hide, and, after soaking it for some time, stretch and render it supple by a lather of the brains in hot water. They not only make their snow-shoes of the skin, but after a chase form the canoes with it: they sew it neatly together, cover the seams with an unctuous earth, and embark in them with their spoils to return home<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">La Hontan, <HI>i. 59.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The hair on the neck, withers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">HAIR.</NOTE> and hams of a full-grown Elk is of much use in making mattrasses and saddles; being by its great length well adapted for those purposes.</P>
<P>The palmated parts of the horns are farther excavated by the sa∣vages, and converted into ladles, which will hold a pint.<NOTE PLACE="marg">HORNS.</NOTE></P>
<P>It is not strange that so useful an animal should be a principal ob∣ject of chase. The savages perform it in different ways. The first,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHASE.</NOTE> and the more simple, is before the lakes or rivers are frozen. Mul∣titudes assemble in their canoes, and form with them a vast crescent, each horn touching the shore. Another party perform their share of the chase among the woods; they surround an extensive tract, let loose their dogs, and press towards the water with loud cries. The animals, alarmed with the noise, fly before the hunters, and plunge into the lake, where they are killed by the persons in the canoes, prepared for their reception, with lances or clubs<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Charlevoix, <HI>v. 188.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The other method is more artful. The savages inclose a large space with stakes hedged with branches of trees, forming two sides
<PB N="20" REF="243"/>
of a triangle: the bottom opens into a second enclosure, com∣pletely triangular. At the opening are hung numbers of snares, made of slips of raw hides. The <HI>Indians,</HI> as before, assemble in great troops, and with all kinds of noises drive into the first enclosure not only the Mooses, but the other species of Deer which abound in that country: some, in forcing their way into the farthest triangle, are caught in the snares by the neck or horns; and those which escape the snares, and pass the little opening, find their fate from the arrows of the hunters, directed at them from all quarters<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Charlevoix, <HI>and</HI> La Hontan, <HI>i. 65.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>They are often killed with the gun. When they are first unhar∣boured, they squat with their hind parts and make water, at which instant the sportsman fires; if he misses, the Moose sets off in a most rapid trot, making, like the Rein-deer, a prodigious rattling with its hoofs, and will run for twenty or thirty miles before it comes to bay or takes the water. But the usual time for this diversion is the win∣ter. The hunters avoid entering on the chase till the sun is strong enough to melt the frozen crust with which the snow is covered, otherwise the animal can run over the firm surface: they wait till it becomes soft enough to impede the flight of the Moose; which sinks up to the shoulders, flounders, and gets on with great difficulty. The sportsman pursues at his ease on his broad rackets, or snow-shoes, and makes a ready prey of the distressed animals,
<Q><L>As weak against the mountain heaps they push</L>
<L>Their beating breast in vain, and piteous bray,</L>
<L>He lays them quivering on th' ensanguin'd snows,</L>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">SUPERSTITIONS RELATING TO THE MOOSE.</NOTE>The opinion of this animal's being subject to the epilepsy seems to have been universal, as well as the cure it finds by scratching its ear with the hind hoof till it draws blood. That hoof has been used in <HI>Indian</HI> medicine for the falling-sickness; they apply it to the heart of
<PB N="21" REF="244"/>
the afflicted, make him hold it in his left hand, and rub his ear with it. They use it also in the colick, pleurisy, vertigo, and purple fever; pulverising the hoof, and drinking it in water. The <HI>Algonkins</HI> pre∣tend that the flesh imparts the disease; but it is notorious that the hu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ers in a manner live on it with impunity.</P>
<P>The savages esteem the Moose a beast of good omen; and are per∣suaded that those who dream often of it may flatter themselves with long life<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Charlevoix,</HI> v. 186.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Their wild superstition hath figured to them a Moose of enor∣mous size, which can wade with ease through eight feet depth of snow; which is invulnerable, and has an arm growing out of its shoulder, subservient to the purposes of the human: that it has a court of other Mooses, who at all times perform suit and service, according to his royal will<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The same.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I lament that I am not able to discover the animal which owned the vast horns so often found in the bogs of <HI>Ireland,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">FOSSIL HORNS NOT BELONGING TO THE MOOSE.</NOTE> so long and so confidently attributed to the <HI>Moose.</HI> These have been found to be sometimes eight feet long, fourteen between tip and tip<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Wright's Louthiana,</HI> book iii. 20. tab. xxii.</NOTE>, furnished with brow antlers, and weighing three hundred pounds: the whole skeleton is frequently found with them.</P>
<P>The fables delivered by <HI>Josselyn,</HI> of the Moose being thirty-three hands, or twelve feet, high; and by <HI>Le Hontan,</HI> of its horns weighing between three and four hundred pounds; occasioned the naturalists of past times to call the fossil horns those of the Moose; and to flatter themselves that they had discovered the animal they belonged to: but recent discoveries evince the error. I once entertained hopes that the <HI>Waskesse</HI> <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Hist.

They attend their herds of Rein-deer, during summer, to the summits of their alps; to the sides of their clear lakes and streams, often bordered with native roses.

<P>Stags are totally extirpated in <HI>Russia,</HI> but abound in the mounta∣nous southern tract of <HI>Sibiria,</HI> where they grow to a size far superior to what is known in <HI>Europe.</HI> The height of a grown Hind is four feet nine inches and a half, its length eight feet; that of its head one foot eight inches and a half.</P>

<P>Inhabits all the provinces south of <HI>Canada,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">PLACE.</NOTE> but in greatest abundance in the southern; but especially the vast savannas con∣tiguous to the <HI>Missisipi,</HI> and the great rivers which flow into it. They graze in herds innumerable, along with the Stags and Buffaloes.

<P>They are capable of being made tame; and when properly trained, are used by the <HI>Indians</HI> to decoy the wild Deer (especially in the rut∣ting season) within shot. Both Bucks and Does herd from <HI>September</HI> to <HI>March;</HI> after that they separate, and the Does secrete themselves to bring forth, and are found with difficulty. The Bucks from this time keep separate, till the amorous season of <HI>September</HI> revolves. The Deer begin to feed as soon as night begins; and sometimes, in the rainy season, in the day: otherwise they seldom or never quit their haunts. An old <HI>Americam</HI> sportsman has remarked, that the Bucks will keep in the thickets for a year, or even two<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Doctor <HI>Garden.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>These animals are very restless, and always in motion, coming and going continually<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Du Pratz, <HI>ii. 51.</HI></NOTE>. Those which live near the shores are lean and bad, subject to worms in their heads and throats, generated from the eggs deposited in those parts<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Lawson, <HI>124.</HI></NOTE>. Those that frequent the hills and savannas are in better case, but the venison is dry. In hard winters they will feed on the long moss which hangs from the trees in the northern parts.</P>
<P>These and other cloven-footed quadrupeds of <HI>America</HI> are very fond of salt, and resort eagerly to the places impregnated with it.<NOTE PLACE="marg">FOND OF SALT.</NOTE> They are always seen in great numbers in the spots where the ground
<PB N="30" REF="253"/>
has been torn by torrents or other accidents, where they are seen licking the earth. Such spots are called <HI>licking-places.</HI> The hunts∣men are sure of finding the game there; for, notwithstanding they are often disturbed, the Buffaloes and Deer are so passionately fond of the savory regale, as to bid defiance to all danger, and return in droves to these favorite haunts.</P>
<P>The skins are a great article of commerce, 25,027 being imported from <HI>New-York</HI> and <HI>Pensylvania</HI> in the sale of 1764.</P>
<P>The Deer are of the first importance to the Savages. The skins form the greatest branch of their traffick, by which they procure from the colonists, by way of exchange, many of the articles of life. To all of them it is the principal food throughout the year; for by drying it over a gentle but clear fire, after cutting it into small pieces, it is not only capable of long preservation, but is very portable in their sudden excursions, especially when reduced to powder, which is frequently done.</P>
<P>Hunting is more than an amusement to these people. They give themselves up to it not only for the sake of subsistence, but to sit themselves for war, by habituating themselves to fatigue. A good huntsman is an able warrior. Those who fail in the sports of the field are never supposed to be capable of supporting the hardships of a campaign; they are degraded to ignoble offices, such as dress∣ing the skins of Deer, and other employs allotted only to slaves and women<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lawson, <HI>208.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>When a large party meditates a hunting-match, which is usually at the beginning of winter, they agree on a place of rendezvous, often five hundred miles distant from their homes, and a place, perhaps, that many of them had never been at. They have no other me∣thod of fixing on the spot than by pointing with their finger. The preference is given to the eldest, as the most experienced<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Catesby,</HI> App. xii.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="254"/>When this matter is settled, they separate into small parties, travel and hunt for subsistence all the day, and rest at night; but the wo∣men have no certain resting-places. The Savages have their particular hunting countries; but if they invade the limits of those belonging to other nations, feuds ensue, fatal as those between <HI>Percy</HI> and <HI>Douglas</HI> in the famed <HI>Chevy Chace.</HI></P>
<P>As soon as they arrive on the borders of the hunting country, (which they never fail doing to a man, be their respective routes ever so distant or so various) the captain of the band delineates on the bark of a tree his own figure, with a Rattlesnake twined round him with distended mouth; and in his hand a bloody tomahawk. By this he implies a destructive menace to any who are bold enough to invade their territories, or to interrupt their diversion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Catesby,</HI> App. ix.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The chase is carried on in different ways. Some surprise the Deer by using the stale of the head, horns, and hide, in the manner be∣fore mentioned: but the general method is performed by the whole body. Several hundreds disperse in a line, encompassing a vast space of country, fire the woods, and drive the animals into some strait or peninsula, where they become an easy prey. The Deer alone are not the object; Foxes, Raccoons, Bears, and all beasts of fur, are thought worthy of attention, and articles of commerce with the <HI>Europeans.</HI></P>
<P>The number of Deer destroyed in some parts of <HI>America</HI> is incre∣dible; as is pretended, from an absurd idea which the Savages have, that the more they destroy, the more they shall find in succeeding years. Certain it is that multitudes are destroyed; the tongues only preserved, and the carcases left a prey to wild beasts. But the motive is much more political. The Savages well discern, that should they overstock the market, they would certainly be over-reached by the <HI>European</HI> dealers, who take care never to produce more goods than are barely sufficient for the demand of the season, establishing their prices according to the quantity of furs brought by the natives. The hunters live in their quarters with the utmost festivity, and indulgence
<PB N="32" REF="255"/>
in all the luxuries of the country. The chase rouzes their appetites; they are perpetually eating, and will even rise to obey, at midnight, the calls of hunger. Their viands are exquisite. Venison boiled with red pease; turkies barbecued and eaten with bears fat; fawns cut out of the does belly, and boiled in the native bag; fish, and crayfish, taken in the next stream; dried peaches, and other fruits, form the chief of their good living<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lawson, <HI>207.</HI></NOTE>. Much of this food is carmina∣tive: they give loose to the effects, and (reverse to the custom of the delicate <HI>Arabs</HI><NOTE PLACE="foot" N="†">D'Arvieux's travels, <HI>147.</HI></NOTE>) laugh most heartily on the occasion<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Lawson, <HI>207.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>They bring along with them their wives and mistresses: not that they pay any great respect to the fair. They make (like the <HI>Cath∣nesians)</HI> errant pack-horses of them, loading them with provisions, or the skins of the chase; or making them provide fire-wood. Love is not the passion of a Savage, at lest it is as brief with them as with the animals they pursue.</P>

<P>Wolves are now so rare in the populated parts of <HI>America,</HI> that the inhabitants leave their sheep the whole night unguarded: yet the governments of <HI>Pensylvania</HI> and <HI>New Jersey</HI> did some years ago allow a reward of twenty shillings, and the last even thirty shillings, for the killing of every Wolf. Tradition informed them what a scourge those animals had been to the colonies; so they wisely determined to prevent the like evil. In their infant state, wolves came down in multitudes from the mountains, often attracted by the smell of the corpses of hundreds of <HI>Indians</HI> who died of the small-pox, brought among them by the <HI>Europeans:</HI> but the animals did not confine their insults to the dead, but even devoured in their huts the sick and dying Savages<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Kalm,</HI> i. 285.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>The <HI>Kamtschatkans, Eskimaux,</HI> and <HI>Greenlanders,</HI> strangers to the softer virtues, treat these poor animals with great neglect.

are fed with fish-bones and <HI>opana,</HI> i. e. putrid fish preserved in pits, and served up to them mixed with hot water.

<P>It is pretty certain that the <HI>Kamtschatkan</HI> Dogs are of wolfish de∣scent; for Wolves abound in that country, in all parts of <HI>Sibiria,</HI> and even under the <HI>Arctic</HI> circle. If their master is flung out of his sledge, they want the affectionate fidelity of the <HI>European</HI> kind, and leave him to follow, never stopping till the sledge is overturned, or else stopped by some impediment<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The same, 107.</NOTE>.

<P>The <HI>Greenlanders</HI> are not better masters.<NOTE PLACE="marg">GREENLAND.</NOTE> They leave their dogs to feed on mussels or berries; unless in a great capture of seals, when they treat them with the blood and garbage. These people also sometimes eat their dogs: use the skins for coverlets, for cloath∣ing, or to border and seam their habits: and their best thread is made of the guts.</P>
<P>The Dogs in general are large; and, in the frigid parts it lest, have the appearance of Wolves: are usually white, with a black face; sometimes varied with black and white, sometimes all white; rarely brown, or all black: have sharp noses, thick hair, and short ears: and seldom bark; but set up a sort of growl, or savage howl. They sleep abroad; and make a lodge in the snow, lying with only their noses out. They swim most excellently: and will hunt, in packs, the ptarmigan, arctic fox, polar bear, and seals lying on the ice. The natives sometimes use them in the chase of the bear. They are ex∣cessively fierce; and, like wolves, instantly fly on the few domestic animals introduced into <HI>Greenland.</HI> They will fight among them∣selves, even to death. Canine madness is unknown in <HI>Greenland</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Faun. Greenl. <HI>p. 19.</HI></NOTE>. They are to the natives in the place of horses: the <HI>Greenlanders</HI> fasten to their sledges from four to ten; and thus make their visits in savage state, or bring home the animals they have killed. <HI>Egede</HI> says that they will travel over the ice fifteen <HI>German</HI> miles in a day, or sixty <HI>English,</HI> with sledges loaden with their masters and five or six large seals<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Egede, <HI>63.</HI> Crantz, <HI>i. 74.</HI></NOTE>.</P>

who use them, as the factory does in <HI>Hudson's Bay,</HI> to draw firing from the woods to the forts.</P>
<P>The Savages who trade to <HI>Hudson's Bay</HI> make use of the wolfish kind to draw their furs.</P>
<P>It is singular, that the race of <HI>European</HI> Dogs shew as strong an antipathy to this <HI>American</HI> species, as they do to the Wolf itself. They never meet with them, but they shew all possible signs of dislike, and will fall on and worry them; while the wolfish breed, with every mark of timidity, puts its tail between its legs, and runs from the rage of the others. This aversion to the Wolf is natural to all ge∣nuine Dogs: for it is well known that a whelp, which has never seen a wolf, will at first sight tremble, and run to its master for pro∣tection: an old dog will instantly attack it.</P>
<P>I shall conclude this article with an abstract of a letter from Dr. <HI>Pallas,</HI> dated <HI>October</HI> 5th 1781; in which he gives the following confirmation of the mixed breed of these animals and Dogs.</P>
<Q>I have seen at <HI>Moscow</HI> about twenty spurious animals from dogs and black wolves. They are for the most part like wolves, except that some carry their tails higher, and have a kind of coarse bark∣ing. They multiply among themselves: and some of the whelps are greyish, rusty, or even of the whitish hue of the Arctic wolves: and one of those I saw, in shape, tail, and hair, and even in bark∣ing, so like a cur, that, was it not for his head and ears, his ill-natured look, and fearfulness at the approach of man, I should hardly have believed that it was of the same breed.</Q>

<P>DOG. With a pointed nose: pointed erect ears: body of a tawny red, mixed with ash-color: fore part of the legs black: tail long and bushy, tipt with white.</P>
<P>Inhabits the northern parts of <HI>North America</HI> from <HI>Hudson's Bay,</HI> probably across the continent to the islands intermediate between <HI>Ame∣rica</HI> and <HI>Kamtschatka.</HI> Captain <HI>Bering</HI> saw there five quite tame, being unused to the sight of man.</P>
<P>This species gradually decreases to the southward, in numbers and in size: none are found lower than <HI>Pensylvania.</HI> They are supposed not to have been originally natives of that country. The <HI>Indians</HI> believe they came from the north of <HI>Europe</HI> in an excessive hard winter, when the season was frozen. The truth seems to be, that they were driven in some severe season from the north of their own country, and have continued there ever since.

They burrow as the <HI>European</HI> foxes do; and in <HI>Hudson's Bay,</HI> during winter, run about the woods in search of prey, feeding on birds and lesser animals, particularly mice.</P>
<P><HI>New England</HI> is said to have been early stocked with foxes by a gentleman who imported them from <HI>England,</HI> for the pleasure of the chase<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Kalm,</HI> i. 283.</NOTE>; and that the present breed sprung from the occasion. This species is reckoned among the pernicious animals, and, being very destructive to lambs, are proscribed at the rate of two shillings a head.</P>
<P>The variety of <HI>British</HI> fox, with a black tip to the tail, seems un∣known in <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="268"/>The skins are a great article of commerce: abundance are im∣ported annually from <HI>Hudson's Bay</HI> and <HI>Newfoundland.</HI> The natives of <HI>Hudson's Bay</HI> eat the flesh, rank as is it is.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">β CROSS.</NOTE>FOX. With a bed of black running along the top of the back, crossed by another passing down each shoulder; from whence it took the name.

<P>This is likewise a very valuable variety. It is remarked, that the more desireable the fur is, the more cunning and difficult to be taken is the fox which owns it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hist.

<P>They are sometimes brought alive into <HI>England.</HI> One which I saw was always in motion, restless, and furious, roaring in a loud and hoarse tone; and so impatient of warmth, that the keeper was obliged to pour on it frequently pailfuls of water. In a state of nature, and in places little visited by mankind, they are of dreadful ferocity. In <HI>Spitzbergen,</HI> and the other places annually frequented by the human race, they dread its power, having experienced its superiority, and shun the conflict: yet even in those countries prove tremendous enemies, if attacked or provoked.</P>

killed. Those whom they seized on they took in their mouths, ran away with the utmost ease, tore to pieces, and devoured at their leisure, even in sight of the surviving comrades. One of these animals was shot preying on the mangled corpse, yet would not quit its hold; but continued staggering away with the body in its mouth, till dispatched with many wounds<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heemskirk's voy. <HI>14.</HI></NOTE>.</P>

<P>They grow excessively fat; a hundred pounds of fat has been taken out of a single beast. Their flesh is coarse, but is eaten by the sea∣men: it is white, and they fancy it tastes like mutton. The liver is very unwholesome, as three of <HI>Heemskirk</HI>'s sailors experienced, who fell dangerously ill on eating some of it boiled<NOTE N="‡‡" PLACE="marg">The same. 45.</NOTE>. The skin is an article of commerce: many are imported, and used chiefly for covers to coach-boxes.

<P><PB N="56" REF="278"/>During summer they reside chiefly on islands of ice, and pass fre∣quently from one to the other. They swim most excellently, and sometimes dive, but continue only a small space under water. They have been seen on islands of ice eighty miles from any land, preying and feeding as they float along. They lodge in dens formed in the vast masses of ice, which are piled in a stupendous manner, leaving great caverns beneath: here they breed, and bring one or two at a time, and sometimes, but very rarely, three. Great is the affection between parent and young; they will sooner die than desert one another<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Marten's Spitzb. <HI>102.</HI></NOTE>.

<P>The Polar Bear became part of the royal menagery as early as the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> III. Mr. <HI>Walpole</HI> has proved how great a patron that despised prince was of the Arts. It is not less evident that he ex∣tended his protection to Natural History. We find he had procured a White Bear from <HI>Norway,</HI> from whence it probably was imported from <HI>Greenland,</HI> the <HI>Norwegians</HI> having possessed that country for some centuries before that period. There are two writs extant from that monarch, directing the sheriffs of <HI>London</HI> to furnish six pence a day to support <HI>our</HI> White Bear in our Tower of <HI>London;</HI> and to pro∣vide a muzzle and iron chain to hold him when out of the water; and a long and strong rope to hold him, when he was fishing in the <HI>Thames</HI><NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Madox's Antiquities of the Exchequer, <HI>i. 376.</HI></NOTE>.

<P>BEAR. With a long pointed nose, and narrow forehead: the cheeks and throat of a yellowish brown color: hair over the whole body and limbs of a glossy black, smoother and shorter than that of the <HI>European</HI> kind.</P>

<P>It is very certain that this species of bear feeds on vegetables.<NOTE PLACE="marg">FOOD.</NOTE> <HI>Du Pratz,</HI> who is a faithful as well as intelligent writer, relates, that
<PB N="58" REF="280"/>
in one severe winter, when these animals were forced in multitudes from the woods, where there was abundance of animal food, they re∣jected that, notwithstanding they were ready to perish with hunger; and, migrating into the lower <HI>Louisiana,</HI> would often break into the courts of houses. They never touched the butchers meat which lay in their way, but fed voraciously on the corn or roots they met with<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Du Pratz, <HI>ii. 57.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>Necessity alone sometimes compels them to attack and feed on the swine they meet in the woods: but flesh is to them an un∣natural diet. They live on berries, fruits, and pulse of all kinds; are remarkably fond of potatoes, which they very readily dig up with their great paws; make great havock in the fields of maize; and are great lovers of milk and honey. They feed much on herrings, which they catch in the season when those fish come in shoals up the creeks, which gives their flesh a disagreeable taste; and the same effect is observed when they eat the bitter berries of the <HI>Tupelo.</HI></P>
<P>They are equally inoffensive to mankind, provided they are not irritated; but if wounded, they will turn on their assailant with great fury, and, in case they can lay hold, never fail of hugging him to death; for it has been observed they never make use, in their rage, of either their teeth or claws. If they meet a man in a path they will not go out of his way; but will not attack him. They never seek combat. A small dog will make them run up a tree.</P>
<P>The bears of <HI>Kamtschatka</HI> resemble those of <HI>America:</HI> they are neither large nor fierce. They also wander from the hills to the lower lands in summer, and feed on berries and fish. They reject carnivorous food, nor ever attack the inhabitants, unless they find them asleep, when, through wantonness, they bite them severely, and sometimes tear a piece of flesh away; yet, notwithstanding they get a taste of human blood, are never known to devour mankind. People thus injured are called <HI>Dranki</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Hist. Kamtschatka, <HI>iii. 386.</HI></NOTE>, or the <HI>flayed.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>American</HI> bears do not lodge in caves or clefts of rocks, like those of <HI>Europe.</HI> The bears of <HI>Hudson's Bay</HI> form their dens beneath
<PB N="59" REF="281"/>
the snow, and suffer some to drop at the mouth, to conceal their re∣treat.</P>
<P>The naturalist's poet, with great truth and beauty, describes the retreat of this animal in the frozen climate of the north:
<Q><L>There through the piny forest half absorpt,</L>
<L>Rough tenant of those shades, the shapeless BEAR,</L>
<L>With dangling ice all horrid, stalks forlorn;</L>
<L>Slow pac'd, and sourer as the storms increase.</L>
<L>He makes his bed beneath th' inclement drift,</L>
<L>And with stern patience, scorning weak complaint,</L>
<L>Hardens his heart against assailing want.</L></Q>
Those of the southern parts dwell in the hollows of antient trees. The hunter discovers them by striking with an ax the tree he suspects they are lodged in, then suddenly conceals himself. The Bear is immediately rouzed, looks out of the hollow to learn the cause of the alarm; seeing none, sinks again into repose<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Du Pratz, <HI>ii. 61.</HI></NOTE>. The hunter then forces him out, by flinging in fired reeds; and shoots him while he descends the body of the tree, which, notwithstanding his aukward appearance, he does with great agility; nor is he less nimble in ascending the tops of the highest trees in search of berries and fruits.</P>
<P>The long time which these animals subsist without food is amaz∣ing. They will continue in their retreat for six weeks without the lest provision, remaining either asleep or totally inactive. It is pretend∣ed that they live by sucking their paws; but that is a vulgar error. The fact is, they retire immediately after autumn, when they have fattened themselves to an excessive degree by the abundance of the fruits which they find at that season. This enables ani∣mals, which perspire very little in a state of rest, to endure an absti∣nence of uncommon length. But when this internal support is ex∣hausted, and they begin to feel the call of hunger, on the approach of the severe season, they quit their dens in search of food. Multitudes
<PB N="60" REF="282"/>
then migrate into the lower parts of <HI>Louisiana:</HI> they arrive very lean; but soon fatten with the vegetables of that milder climate<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Du Pratz, <HI>ii. 60.</HI></NOTE>. They never wander far from the banks of the <HI>Missisipi,</HI> and in their march form a beaten path like the track of men.</P>
<P><HI>Lawson</HI> and <HI>Catesby</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lawson, <HI>117.</HI> Catesby, App. <HI>xxvi.</HI></NOTE> relate a very surprizing thing in respect to this animal, which is, that neither <HI>European</HI> or <HI>Indian</HI> ever killed a Bear with young. In one winter were killed in <HI>Virginia</HI> five hun∣dred bears, and among them only two females; and those not preg∣nant. The cause is, that the male has the same unnatural dislike to its offspring as some other animals have: they will kill and de∣vour the cubs. The females therefore retire, before the time of par∣turition, into the depth of woods and rocks, to elude the search of their savage mates. It is said that they do not make their appear∣ance with their young till <HI>March</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Josselyn's voy: <HI>91.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>All who have tasted the flesh of this animal say, that it is most de∣licious eating: a young Bear, fattened with the autumnal fruits, is a dish fit for the nicest epicure. It is wholesome and nourishing, and re∣sembles pork more than any other meat. The tongue and the paws are esteemed the most exquisite morsels; the hams are also excellent, but apt to rust, if not very well preserved.</P>
<P>Four inches depth of fat has been found on a single Bear, and fif∣teen or sixteen gallons of pure oil melted from it<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Bartram's journ. E. Florida, <HI>26.</HI></NOTE>. The fat is of a pure white, and has the singular quality of never lying heavy on the stomach, notwithstanding a person drank a quart of it<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Lawson, <HI>116.</HI></NOTE>. The <HI>Ame∣ricans</HI> make great use of it for frying their fish. It is besides used medicinally, and has been found very efficacious in rheumatic com∣plaints, achs, and strains.</P>
<P>The <HI>Indians</HI> of <HI>Louisiana</HI> prepare it thus:—As soon as they have killed the Bear, they shoot a Deer; cut off the head, and draw the skin entire to the legs, which they cut off: they then stop up every orifice, except that on the neck, into which they pour the melted fat
<PB N="61" REF="283"/>
of the Bear; which is prepared by boiling the fat and flesh together. This they call a <HI>Deer of oil,</HI> and sell to the <HI>French</HI> for a gun, or some∣thing of equal value<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Du Pratz, <HI>ii. 62.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>Bears grease is in great repute in <HI>Europe</HI> for its supposed quality of making the hair to grow on the human head. A great chymist in the <HI>Haymarket</HI> in <HI>London</HI> used to fatten annually two or three Bears for the sake of their fat.</P>
<P>The skin is in use for all purposes which the coarser sorts of furs are applied to: it serves in <HI>America,</HI> in distant journies, for coverlets; and the finer parts have been in some places used in the hat manu∣facture<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lawson, <HI>117.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The <HI>Indians</HI> of <HI>Canada</HI> daub their hands and face with the grease, to preserve them from the bite of musketoes: they also smear their bodies with the oil after excessive exercise<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Kalm,</HI> iii. 13.</NOTE>.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">BEARS VENERAT∣ED IN AMERICA.</NOTE>In all savage nations the Bear has been an object of veneration. Among the <HI>Americans</HI> a feast is made in honor of each that is killed. The head of the beast is painted with all colors, and placed on an elevated place, where it receives the respects of all the guests, who celebrate in songs the praises of the Bear. They cut the body in pieces, and regale on it, and conclude the ceremony<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Charlevoix, Nouv. Fr. <HI>v. 443.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">CHASE.</NOTE>The chase of these animals is a matter of the first importance, and never undertaken without abundance of ceremony. A principal warrior first gives a general invitation to all the hunters. This is followed by a most serious fast of eight days, a total abstinence from all kinds of food; notwithstanding which, they pass the day in continual song. This they do to invoke the spirits of the woods to direct them to the place where there are abundance of bears. They even cut the flesh in divers parts of their bodies, to render the spirits more propitious. They also address themselves to the <HI>manes</HI> of the beasts slain in preceding chases, as if it were to direct them in their dreams to plenty of game. One dreamer alone cannot determine
<PB N="63" REF="285"/>
the place of chase, numbers must concur; but, as they tell each other their dreams, they never fail to agree: whether that may arise from complaisance, or by a real agreement in the dreams from their thoughts being perpetually turned on the same thing.</P>
<P>The chief of the hunt now gives a great feast, at which no one dares to appear without first bathing. At this entertainment they eat with great moderation, contrary to their usual custom. The master of the feast alone touches nothing; but is employed in relating to the guests antient tales of the wonderful feats in former chases: and fresh invocations to the manes of the deceased bears conclude the whole. They then sally forth amidst the acclamations of the village, equipped as if for war, and painted black. Every able hunter is on a level with a great warrior; but he must have killed his dozen great beasts before his character is established: after which his alliance is as much courted as that of the most valiant captain.</P>
<P>They now proceed on their way in a direct line: neither rivers, marshes, or any other impediments, stop their course; driving before them all the beasts which they find in their way. When they arrive in the hunting-ground, they surround as large a space as their com∣pany will admit, and then contract their circle; searching, as they contract, every hollow tree, and every place fit for the retreat of the bear, and continue the same practice till the time of the chase is ex∣pired.</P>
<P>As soon as a bear is killed, a hunter puts into its mouth a lighted pipe of tobacco, and, blowing into it, fills the throat with the smoke, conjuring the spirit of the animal not to resent what they are going to do to its body; nor to render their future chases unsuccessful. As the beast makes no reply, they cut out the string of the tongue, and throw it into the fire: if it crackles and runs in (which it is al∣most sure to do) they accept it as a good omen; if not, they consider that the spirit of the beast is not appeased, and that the chase of the next year will be unfortunate.</P>
<P>The hunters live well during the chase, on provisions which they bring with them. They return, home with great pride and self-sufficiency;
<PB N="64" REF="286"/>
for to kill a bear forms the character of a complete man. They again give a great entertainment, and now make a point to leave nothing. The feast is dedicated to a certain genius, perhaps that of Gluttony, whose resentment they dread, if they do not eat every morsel, and even sup up the very melted grease in which the meat was dressed. They sometimes eat till they burst, or bring on themselves some violent disorders. The first course is the greatest bear they have killed, without even taking out the entrails, or taking off the skin, contenting themselves with singeing the skin, as is prac∣tised with hogs<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Charlevoix,</HI> v. 169 to 174.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The <HI>Kamtschatkans,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">IN KAMTSCHAT∣KA.</NOTE> before their conversion to Christianity, had al∣most similar superstitions respecting bears and other wild beasts: they entreated the bears and wolves not to hurt them in the chase, and whales and marine animals not to overturn their boats. They never call the two former by their proper name, but by that of <HI>Si∣pang,</HI> or <HI>ill-luck.</HI></P>
<P>At present the <HI>Kamtschatkans</HI> kill the bear and other wild beasts with guns: formerly they had variety of inventions; such as filling the entrance of its den with logs, and then digging down upon the ani∣mal and destroying it with spears<NOTE N="†" PLACE="marg">Hist. Kamtschatka, Fr. <HI>iii. 73.</HI></NOTE>. In <HI>Sibiria</HI> it is taken by making a trap-fall of a great piece of timber, which drops and crushes it to death: or by forming a noose in a rope fastened to a great log; the bear runs its head into the noose, and, finding itself engaged, grows furious, and either falls down some precipice and kills itself, or wea∣ries itself to death by its agitations.</P>
<P>The killing of a bear in fair battle is reckoned as great a piece of heroism by the <HI>Kamtschatkans</HI> as it is with the <HI>Americans.</HI> The victor makes a feast on the occasion, and feasts his neighbors with the beast; then hangs the head and thighs about his tent by way of trophies.</P>
<P>These people use the skins to lie on, and for coverlets; for bonnets, gloves, collars for their dogs, soles for their shoes, to prevent them
<PB N="65" REF="287"/>
from slipping on the ice. Of the shoulder-blades they make instru∣ments to cut the grass; of the intestines, covers for their faces, to protect them from the sun during spring; and the <HI>Cossacks</HI> extend them over their windows instead of glass. The flesh and fat is among the chief dainties of the country<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hist. Kamtschatka, Fr. <HI>iii. 390.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>Superstitions, relative to this animal, did not confine themselves to <HI>America</HI> and <HI>Asia,</HI> but spread equally over the north of <HI>Europe.</HI> The <HI>Laplanders</HI> held it in the greatest veneration: they called it the <HI>Dog</HI> of GOD, because they esteemed it to have the strength of ten men, and the sense of twelve<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Leems Lapmark, Suppl. <HI>64.</HI></NOTE>. They never presume to call it by its proper name of <HI>Guouzhja,</HI> least it revenge the insult on their flocks; but style it <HI>Moedda-aigia,</HI> or the <HI>old man in a furred cloak</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">The same, 502.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The killing of a Bear was reckoned as great an exploit in <HI>Lapland</HI> as it was in <HI>America,</HI> and the hero was held in the highest esteem by both sexes; and, by a singular custom, was forbid all commerce with his wife for three days. The <HI>Laplanders</HI> bring home the slain beasts in great triumph. They erect a new tent near their former dwelling, but never enter it till they have flung off the dress of the chase. They continue in it three entire days; and the women keep at home the same space. The men dress the flesh of the Bear in the new tent, and make their repast, giving part to the females; but take great care never to bestow on them a bit of the rump. Neither will they deliver to them the meat through the common entrance of the hut, but through a hole in another part. In sign of victory, the men sprinkle themselves with the blood of the beast.</P>
<P>After they have finished eating the flesh, they bury the bones with great solemnity, and place every bone in its proper place, from a firm persuasion that the Bear will be restored, and re-animate a new body.</P>
<P>At the pulling off the skin, and cutting the body into pieces, they were used to sing a song, but without meaning or rhyme<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">The same, <HI>Suppl.</HI></NOTE>; but the

<P>This is one of the local animals of <HI>America.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">PLACE.</NOTE> I trace it as far north as the <HI>Copper</HI> river, and to the countries on the west and south of <HI>Hud∣son's Bay, Canada,</HI> and the tract as far as the straits of <HI>Michillmakinac,</HI> between the lakes <HI>Huron</HI> and <HI>Superior.</HI></P>
<P>I have reason to think that the Glutton of the old writers is the same with this animal;<NOTE PLACE="marg">GLUTTON OF OLD WRITERS.</NOTE> and that in my History of Quadrupeds I un∣necessarily separated them. Since I have received the late publication of Dr. <HI>Pallas,</HI> I am satisfied that it is common to the north of <HI>America, Europe,</HI> and <HI>Asia,</HI> even to <HI>Kamtschatka;</HI> inhabiting the vast forests of the north, even within the <HI>Polar</HI> circle. The <HI>Kamtschatkans</HI> value them so highly as to say, that the heavenly beings wear no other furs. The skins are the greatest present they can make their mistres∣ses; and the women ornament their heads with the parts of the white banded variety. The <HI>Russians</HI> call these animals <HI>Rossomak;</HI> the <HI>Kamtschatkans, Tymi,</HI> or <HI>Tummi.</HI></P>
<P>It is a beast of uncommon fierceness,<NOTE PLACE="marg">MANNERS.</NOTE> the terror of the Wolf and Bear; the former, which will devour any carrion, will not touch the carcase of this animal, which smells more fetid than that of a Pole∣cat. It has great strength, and makes vast resistance when taken; will tear the traps often to pieces; or if wounded, will snap the stock from the barrel of the musket; and often do more damage in the capture than the fur is worth.</P>
<P>It preys indifferently on all animals which it can master. It feeds by night, and, being slow of foot, follows the track of wolves and foxes in the snow, in order to come in for share of their prey. It will dig up the carcases of animals, and the provisions concealed by the
<PB N="68" REF="290"/>
huntsmen deep in the snow, which it will carry away to other places to devour. About the <HI>Lena</HI> it will attack horses, on whose backs are often seen the marks of its teeth and claws. By a wonderful sa∣gacity it will ascend a tree, and fling from the boughs a species of moss which Elks and Reins are very fond of; and when those ani∣mals come beneath to feed on it, will fall on them and destroy them: or, like the Lynx, it ascends to the boughs of trees, and falls on the Deer which casually pass beneath, and adheres till they fall down with fatigue. It is a great enemy to the Beaver<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dobbs, <HI>40.</HI></NOTE>, and is on that ac∣count sometimes called the <HI>Beaver-eater.</HI> It watches at the mouth of their holes, and catches them as they come out. It searches the traps laid for taking other beasts, and devours those which it finds taken. It breaks into the magazines of the natives, and robs them of the pro∣visions; whether they are covered with logs, brushwood, and built high between two or three standing trees<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mr. Graham.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It lodges in clefts of rocks, or in hollows of trees, and in <HI>Sibiria</HI> often in the deserted holes of Badgers; never digging its own den, nor having any certain habitation. It breeds once a year, bringing from two to four at a litter<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">The same.</NOTE>. Its fur is much used for muffs. Not∣withstanding its great fierceness when wounded, or first seizure, it is capable of being made very tame<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><HI>Edw.</HI> ii. 103.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">FUR.</NOTE>The skins are frequently brought from <HI>Hudson's Bay,</HI> and com∣monly used for muffs.

<P>It is made tame with great ease, so as to follow its master along the streets; but never can be broke from its habit of stealing, or killing of poultry<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Kalm,</HI> i. 208.</NOTE>.

<P>OPOSSUM. With ten cutting teeth above, eight beneath:<NOTE PLACE="marg">24.

<P>On the lower part of the belly of the female is a large pouch, in which the teats are placed, and in which the young lodge as soon as they are born. The body is cloathed with very long soft hairs, ly∣ing usually uneven: the color appears of a dirty white; the lower parts of the hairs dusky: and above each eye is a whitish spot: the belly tinged with yellow.</P>
<P>The length of one I examined was seventeen inches, of the tail fourteen.</P>

As soon as they come into the world they retreat into the false belly, blind, naked, and exactly resembling little foetuses. They fasten closely to the teats, as if they grew to them; which has given cause to the vulgar error, that they were created so. There they adhere as if they were inanimate, till they arrive at a degree of perfection in shape, and attain sight, strength, and hair: after which they undergo a sort of second birth. From that time they run into the pouch as an asylum from danger. The female carries them about with the utmost af∣fection, and would rather be killed than permit this receptacle to be opened; for she has the power of contracting or dilating the orifice by the help of some very strong muscles. If they are surprised, and have not time to retreat into the pouch, they will adhere to the tail of the parent, and escape with her<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The same.</NOTE>.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">FURS WHEN FIRST USED AS A LUXU∣RY.</NOTE>It was not till the later ages that the furs of beasts became an ar∣ticle of luxury. The more refined nations of antient times never made use of them: those alone whom the former stigmatized as bar∣barians, were cloathed in the skins of animals. <HI>Strabo</HI> describes the <HI>Indians</HI> covered with the skins of Lions, Panthers, and Bears<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Strabo,</HI> lib. xvii. p. 1184.</NOTE>; and <HI>Seneca</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Epist.</HI> Ep. xc.</NOTE>, the <HI>Scythians</HI> cloathed with the skins of Foxes, and the lesser quadrupeds. <HI>Virgil</HI> exhibits a picture of the savage <HI>Hyperboreans,</HI> similar to that which our late circumnavigators can witness to in the cloathing of the wild <HI>Americans,</HI> unseen before by any polished people.
<Q><L>Gens effraena virum <HI>Riphaeo</HI> tunditur Euro;</L>
<L>Et pecudum fulvis velantur corpora setis.</L></Q>
Most part of <HI>Europe</HI> was at this time in similar circumstances. <HI>Caesar</HI> might be as much amazed with the skin-dressed heroes of <HI>Britain,</HI> as our celebrated <HI>Cook</HI> was at those of his new-discovered regions. What time hath done to us, time, under humane conquerors, may effect for them. Civilization may take place, and those spoils of animals, which are at present essential for cloathing, become the mere objects of ornament and luxury.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="303"/>I cannot find that the <HI>Greeks</HI> or old <HI>Romans</HI> ever made use of furs. It originated in those regions where they most abounded, and where the severity of the climate required that species of cloathing. At first it consisted of the skins only, almost in the state in which they were torn from the body of the beast; but as soon as civilization took place, and manufactures were introduced, furs became the lining of the dress, and often the elegant facing of the robes. It is probable, that the north∣ern conquerors introduced the fashion into <HI>Europe.</HI> We find, that about the year 522, when <HI>Totila,</HI> king of the <HI>Visigoths,</HI> reigned in <HI>Italy,</HI> that the <HI>Suethons</HI> (a people of modern <HI>Sweden</HI>) found means, by help of the commerce of numberless intervening people, to transmit, for the use of the <HI>Romans, saphilinas pelles,</HI> the precious skins of the Sables<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jornandes di Rebus Geticis.</NOTE>. As luxury advanced, furs, even of the most valuable species, were used by princes as lining for their tents: thus <HI>Marco Polo,</HI> in 1252, found those of the <HI>Cham</HI> of <HI>Tartary</HI> lined with Ermines and Sables<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">In Bergeron's Coll. <HI>70.</HI> Purchas, <HI>iii. 86.</HI></NOTE>. He calls the last <HI>Zibelines,</HI> and <HI>Zambolines.</HI> He says that those, and other precious furs, were brought from countries far north; from the <HI>land of Darkness,</HI> and regions almost inaccessible, by reason of morasses and ice<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">160, 161, 162.</NOTE>. The <HI>Welsh</HI> set a high value on furs, as early as the time of <HI>Howel Dda</HI><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Leges Wallicae.</NOTE>, who began his reign about 940. In the next age, furs became the fashionable magnificence of <HI>Europe.</HI> When <HI>Godfrey</HI> of <HI>Boulogne,</HI> and his followers, appeared before the emperor <HI>Alexis Comnene,</HI> on their way to the <HI>Holy Land,</HI> he was struck with the richness of their dresses, <HI>tam ex ostro quam aurifrigio et niveo opere harmelino et ex mardrino gri∣sioque et vario.</HI> How different was the advance of luxury in <HI>France,</HI> from the time of their great monarch <HI>Charlemagne,</HI> who contented himself with the plain fur of the Otter! <HI>Henry</HI> I. wore furs; yet in his distress was obliged to change them for warm <HI>Welsh</HI> flannel<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Barrington on the Statutes, <HI>4th ed. 243.</HI></NOTE>. But in the year 1337 the luxury had got to such a head, that <HI>Edward</HI> III. enacted, that all persons who could not spend a hundred a year, should absolutely be prohibited the use of this species of finery.
<PB N="82" REF="304"/>
These, from their great expence, must have been foreign furs, ob∣tained from the <HI>Italian</HI> commercial states, whose traffic was at this period boundless. How strange is the revolution in the fur trade!

<P>WEESEL. With ears broad, round, and dusky, edged with white: head and sides of the neck pale brown mixed with ash-color and black: hairs on the back, belly, legs, and tail, brown at the base, and black at their ends: sides of the body brown.</P>
<P>The feet very large and broad, covered above and below thickly with hair: on each foot are five toes, with white claws, sharp, strong, and crooked: the fore legs shorter than those behind: the tail is full and bushy, smallest at the end.

<P>WEESEL. With small and rounded ears: the ground color of the whole animal black, marked on the back and sides with five long parallel lines of white; one extending from the head along the top of the back to the base of the tail; with two others on each side, the highest of which reaches a little way up the tail: the tail is long, and very bushy towards the end.</P>
<P>This species varies in the disposition of the stripes, and I suspect the male is entirely black, as described by <HI>M. Du Pratz</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. ii. 67.</NOTE>; who says, that the female has rings of white intermixed. If that is the case, the <HI>Coase,</HI> which <HI>M. de Buffon</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">xiii. <HI>Coase,</HI> p. 288. <HI>Le Conepute</HI> (the female) ibid. tab. xxxviii. xl.</NOTE> received from <HI>Virginia,</HI> is of this kind. It is of an uniform color; but what is a stronger proof of their differing only in sex, is the agreement in number of toes in the fore feet, there being four on each; an exception to the character of this Genus.</P>
<P>In size it is equal to an <HI>European</HI> Pole-cat, but carries its back more elevated.</P>
<P>These animals are found from <HI>Pensylvania</HI> as far as <HI>Louisiana,</HI> where they are known by the name of the Pole-cat <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Catesby,</HI> ii. tab. 62.</NOTE> or Skunk; which is given indifferently to both of these foetid beasts.</P>
<P>Nature hath furnished this and the following a species of defence superior to the force either of teeth or claws. The <HI>French</HI> most justly call these animals <HI>enfans du Diable,</HI> or children of the Devil, and <HI>Bêtes puantes,</HI> or the stinking beasts; as the <HI>Swedes</HI> bestow on them that of <HI>Fiskatta.</HI> The pestiferous vapour which it emits from behind, when it is either attacked, pursued, or frightened, is so suffocating and foetid, as at once to make the boldest assailant retire with precipita∣tion.
<PB N="84" REF="306"/>
A small space is often no means of security; the animal either will turn its tail, and by a frequent crepitus prevent all repetition of attempts on its liberty; or else ejaculate its stiffing urine to the dis∣tance of eighteen feet<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Kalm,</HI> i. 275.</NOTE>. Its enemy is stupified with the abominable stench; or perhaps experiences a temporary blindness, should any of the liquid fall on his eyes. No washing will free his cloaths from the smell: they must even be buried in fresh soil, in order to be ef∣fectually purified.</P>
<P>Persons who have just undergone this misfortune, naturally run to the next house to try to free themselves from it; but the rights of hospitality are denied to them: the owner, dreading the infection, is sure to shut the door against them.</P>
<P>Professor <HI>Kalm</HI> ran the danger of being suffocated by the stench of one, which was pursued into a house where he was.</P>
<P>A maid-servant, who destroyed another in a room where meat was kept, was so affected by the vapour as to continue ill for several days; and the provisions were so infected, that the master of the house was forced to fling them away<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The same, 277.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Travellers are often obliged, even in the midst of forests, to hold their noses, to prevent the effects of its stench.</P>
<P>The brute creation are in like dread of its effluvia. Cattle will roar with agony; and none but true-bred dogs will attack it: even those are often obliged to run their noses into the ground before they can return to complete its destruction. The smell of the dogs, after a combat of this nature, remains for several days intolerable.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding this horrible quality, the flesh is eaten, and is esteemed as sweet as that of a Pig. The bladder must be taken out, and the skin flayed off, as soon as the animal is killed<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Lawson, <HI>119.</HI> Kalm, <HI>i. 278.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>I should think it a very disagreeable companion: yet it is often tamed so as to follow its master like a Dog; for it never emits its

vapour unless terrified<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Kalm,</HI> i. 278.</NOTE>. It surely ought to be treated with the highest attention.</P>
<P>The skin is neglected by the <HI>Europeans,</HI> by reason of the coarseness of the hair. The <HI>Indians</HI> make use of it for tobacco pouches, which they carry before them like the <HI>Highlanders.</HI></P>
<P>It climbs trees with great agility. It feeds on fruits <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Catesby,</HI> ii. tab. 62.</NOTE> and insects. Is a great enemy to birds, destroying both their eggs and young. It will also break into hen-roosts, and destroy all the poultry<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Kalm,</HI> i. 274.</NOTE>.

<P><PB N="89" REF="311"/>The skin is extremely thick, covered closely with long hair, re∣markably black and glossy; and beneath that is a soft down. The hair sometimes varies to silvery. The hair of the young is soft and brown.</P>

<P>They are most extremely harmless,<NOTE PLACE="marg">MANNERS.</NOTE> and most singularly affectionate to their young. They will never desert them, and will even pine to death on being robbed of them, and strive to breathe their last on the spot where they experienced the misfortune.</P>
<P>It is supposed that they bring but one at a time. They go be∣tween eight and nine months with young, and suckle it almost the whole year. The young never quits its dam till it takes a mate. They are monogamous, and very constant.</P>
<P>They bring forth on land: often carry the young between their teeth, fondle them, and frequently fling them up and catch them again in their paws. Before the young can swim, the old ones will take them in their fore feet, and swim about upon their backs.</P>
<P>They run very swiftly: swim sometimes on their sides, on their backs, and often in a perpendicular direction. They are very spor∣tive, embrace each other, and kiss.</P>
<P>They never make any resistance; but endeavour, when attacked, to save themselves by flight: when they have escaped to some dis∣tance, they will turn back, and hold one of their fore feet over their

eyes, to gaze, as men do their hands to see more clearly in a sunny day; for they are very dull-sighted, but remarkably quick-scented.</P>
<P>They are fond of those parts of the sea which abound most with weeds, where they feed on fish, sepiae, lobsters, and shell-fish, which they comminute with their flat grinders.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">CAPTURE.</NOTE>They are taken different ways: in the summer, by placing nets among the sea-plants, where these animals retire in the frequent storms of this tempestuous coast.</P>
<P>They are killed with clubs or spears, either while they lie asleep on the rocks, or in the sea floating on their backs.</P>
<P>Thirdly, they are pursued by two boats till they are tired, for they cannot endure to be long at a time under water.</P>
<P>During winter they are brought in great numbers to the <HI>Kurilian</HI> islands, by the eastern winds, from the <HI>American</HI> shore.</P>
<P>The hunter goes with a dog, who points them. He knocks it on the head, and flays it, while the dog is beating about for another.</P>
<P>They are called in the <HI>Kamtschatkan</HI> tongue <HI>Kalan,</HI> in the plural <HI>Kalani.</HI></P>
<P>Their flesh is preferred to that of Seals by the natives; but the unfortunate crew who were shipwrecked in the expedition in 1741, under Captain <HI>Bering,</HI> found it to be insipid, hard, and tough as leather; so that they were obliged to cut it in small pieces before they could eat it. Others pretend, that the flesh of the young is very delicate, and scarcely to be distinguished from young lamb.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">FUR.</NOTE>But the valuable part of them is their skin. Few are brought into <HI>Europe;</HI> but great quantities are sold to the <HI>Chinese,</HI> at vast prices, from seventy to a hundred rubles apiece, or 14 or 25l. sterling each.

In the same unsociable state they inhabit <HI>Europe,</HI> and are found in <HI>Russia,</HI> in <HI>Lapland, Norway,</HI> and <HI>Sweden.</HI></P>
<P>These are the most sagacious and industrious of animals.<NOTE PLACE="marg">SAGACITY.</NOTE> They live in society, and unite in their labors, for the good of the com∣monwealth they form. They erect edifices, superior in contrivance to the human beings. They usually live near, and shew a dexterity in their oeconomy unequalled by the four-footed race.</P>
<P>In order to form a habitation, they select a level piece of ground,<NOTE PLACE="marg">DWELLINGS.</NOTE> with a small rivulet running in the midst. To effect their works, a community of two or three hundred assembles: every individual bears his share in the laborious preparation.<NOTE PLACE="marg">LABORS.</NOTE> Some fall trees of great size, by gnawing them asunder with their teeth, in order to form beams or piles; others are employed in rolling the pieces to the wa∣ter; others dive, and scrape holes with their feet in order to fix them; and another set exert their efforts to rear them in their proper places. A fifth party is busied in collecting twigs to wattle the piles. A sixth, in collecting earth, stones, and clay; others carry it on their broad tails to proper places, and with their feet beat and temper the earth into mortar, or ram it between the piles, or plaister the inside of the houses.</P>
<P>All these preparations are to form their dwellings within an arti∣ficial piece of water or pond,<NOTE PLACE="marg">DAMS.</NOTE> which they make by raising a dam across the level spot they had pitched on. This is done, first by driv∣ing
<PB N="100" REF="321"/>
into the ground stakes, five or six feet long, placed in rows, and securing each row by wattling it with twigs, and filling the inter∣stices with clay, ramming it down close. The side next to the water is sloped, the other perpendicular. The bottom is from ten to twelve feet thick; the thickness gradually diminishes to the top, which is about two or three. The centre of the dam forms a segment of a circle; from which extends, on each side, a strait wing: in the midst of the centre is usually a gutter left for the waste water to dis∣charge itself. These dams are often a hundred feet long, and nicely covered with turf.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">HOUSES.</NOTE>The houses these wise animals make, are placed in the water col∣lected by means of the dam, and are seated near the shore. They are built upon piles, and are sometimes round, sometimes oval; the tops are vaulted, so that their inside resembles an oven, their outside a dome. The walls are made of earth, stones, and sticks, and usually two feet thick. They are commonly about eight feet high above the surface of the water<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Clerk, <HI>i. 142.</HI></NOTE>, and are very neatly and closely plaistered on the inside. The floor is a foot higher than the water. The house, sometimes, has only one floor, which is strewed with leaves or moss, on which each Beaver lies in its proper place; at other times there are three apartments; one to lodge, another to eat in, and a third to dung in<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mr. Graham. Catesby, App. <HI>xxx.</HI></NOTE>: for they are very cleanly, and instantly cause the filth to be carried off by the inferior Beavers.</P>
<P><HI>M. Du Pratz</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">i. 241.</NOTE> says, that those of <HI>Louisiana</HI> form numbers of cells, and that each animal, or more probably each pair, possess one. He says, that he has seen no less than fifteen of these cells surrounding the centre of one house. He also acquaints us, that the Beavers of <HI>Louisiana</HI> are a third less than the brown sort; are covered with a ci∣nereous down, which is covered with long silvery hairs.</P>
<P>In each house are two openings; one towards the land, the other is within, and communicates with the water, for the conveniency of
<PB N="101" REF="322"/>
getting to their magazine of provision in frosty weather.<NOTE PLACE="marg">MAGAZINES.</NOTE> This ori∣fice is formed so as to be beyond the thickness of the ice; for they lodge their provisions under the water, and dive and bring it into their house according as they want it.</P>
<P>Their food is laid in before winter by the tenants of each house;<NOTE PLACE="marg">FOOD.</NOTE> it consists of the bark and boughs of trees. <HI>Lawson</HI> says that they are fondest of the sassafras, ash, and sweet gum. In summer they live on leaves, fruits, and sometimes crabs and cray-fish; but they are not fond of fish.</P>
<P>The number of houses in each pond is from ten to twenty-five:<NOTE PLACE="marg">NUMBER OF HOUSES;</NOTE> the number of animals in each, from two to thirty. They are sup∣posed to associate in pairs; are therefore monogamous: another proof of their advances towards civilization.</P>
<P>I think I have heard that every family consists of an even number.<NOTE PLACE="marg">OF INHABITANTS.</NOTE> Sometimes the community, within the precinct of a dam, consists of four hundred; but I presume this must be in places little frequented by mankind.</P>
<P>They begin to build their houses, when they form a new settle∣ment, in the summer; and it costs them a whole season to finish their work, and lay in their provisions.</P>
<P>They are very attentive to their safety; and on any noise take to the water for their further security. They form vaults or burrows in the banks of the creek formed by the dam, into which they retreat in case of imminent danger.</P>
<P>They seem to be among quadrupeds, what Bees are among insects. They have a chief, or superintendant, in their works,<NOTE PLACE="marg">OVERSEERS.</NOTE> who directs the whole. The utmost attention is paid to him by the whole commu∣nity. Every individual has his task allotted, which they undertake with the utmost alacrity. The overseer gives a signal by a certain number of smart slaps with his tail, expressive of his orders. The moment the artificers hear it, they hasten to the place thus pointed out, and perform the allotted labor, whether it is to carry wood, or draw the clay, or repair any accidental breach.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="323"/><NOTE PLACE="marg">CENTINELS.</NOTE>They have also their centinels, who, by the same kind of signal, give notice of any apprehended danger.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">SLAVES.</NOTE>They are said to have a sort of slavish Beaver among them (analo∣gous to the Drone) which they employ in servile works, and the do∣mestic drudgery<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Graham.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I have mentioned before their sagacity in laying in the winter pro∣vision.<NOTE PLACE="marg">THEIR WOOD HOW CUT.</NOTE> They cut the wood they prefer into certain lengths; pile them in heaps beneath the water, to keep them moist; and, when they want food, bite the wood into small pieces, and bring it into their houses. The <HI>Indians</HI> observe the quantity which the Beavers lay in their magazine at approach of winter. It is the Almanack of the Savages; who judge from the greater or less stock, of the mildness or severity of the approaching season<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Charlevoix, <HI>v. 151.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The expedition with which they cut down trees, for the forming their dams, is amazing. A number surrounds the body, and will in a few minutes gnaw through a tree of three feet in circumference; and always contrive to make it fall towards the spot they wish<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Catesby, App. <HI>30.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>Beavers have in <HI>America</HI> variety of lakes and waters in which they might fix their seats; but their sagacity informs them of the preca∣rious tenure of such dwellings, which are liable to be overthrown by every flood. This induces them to undertake their mighty and mar∣vellous labors. They therefore select places where no such inconve∣niences can be felt. They form a dam to support a reservoir, fed only by a small rill; and provide for the overflow of the waste water by a suitable channel in the middle of their bank. They have no∣thing to fear but from land floods, or the sudden melting of the snows. These sometimes make breaches, or damage their houses; but the defects are instantly repaired.</P>
<P>During the winter they never stir out, except to their magazines of provision; and in that season grow excessively fat.</P>
<P>They are strongly attached to certain haunts, there being places winch they will not quit, notwithstanding they are frequently dis∣turbed.
<PB N="103" REF="324"/>
There is, says <HI>Charlevoix,</HI> a strong instance on the road be∣tween <HI>Montreal</HI> and lake <HI>Huron,</HI> which travellers, through wantonness, annually molest; yet is always repaired by the industrious inhabi∣tants.</P>
<P>In violent inundations they are sometimes overpowered in their attempts to divert the fury of the water. In those cases they fly into the woods: the females return as soon as the water abates; the males continue absent till <HI>July,</HI> when they come back to repair the ravages made in their houses<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Charlevoix, <HI>v. 151.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>Bearvers breed once a year, and bring forth the latter end of winter; and have two or three young at a birth.</P>
<P>There is a variety of the Beaver kind,<NOTE PLACE="marg">TERRIER BEAVERS.</NOTE> which wants either the sa∣gacity or the industry of the others, in forming dams and houses. These are called <HI>Terriers.</HI> They burrow in the banks of rivers, and make their holes beneath the freezing depth of the water, and work upwards for a great number of feet. These also form their winter magazines of provision. Beavers which escape the destruction of a community, are supposed often to become <HI>Terriers.</HI></P>
<P>Strange animal seen by Mr. <HI>Phipps</HI> and others in <HI>Newfoundland,</HI> of a shining black: bigger than a Fox: shaped like an <HI>Italian</HI> grehound: legs long: tail long and taper. One gentleman saw five sitting on a rock with their young, at the mouth of a river; often leapt in and dived, and brought up trouts, which they gave to their young. When he shewed himself, they all leapt into the water, and swam a little way from shore, put their heads out of the water and looked at him. An old furrier said, he remembered a skin of one sold for five guineas. The <HI>French</HI> often see them in <HI>Hare Bay.</HI></P>
<P>Beavers have, besides man, two enemies; the Otter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">THEIR ENEMIES.</NOTE> and the Wol∣verene; which watch their appearance, and destroy them. The last is on tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> account called, in some parts of <HI>America,</HI> the <HI>Beaver-eater.</HI> They are very easily overcome; for they make no resistance: and have no security but in flight.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="325"/>It is not wonderful that such sociable animals should be very affec∣tionate. Two young Beavers, which were taken alive and brought to a neighboring factory in <HI>Hudson's Bay,</HI> were preserved for some time; and throve very fast, till one of them was killed by an acci∣dent. The survivor instantly felt the loss, began to moan, and ab∣stained from food till it died<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Drage's voy. <HI>i. 151.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">HOW TAKEN.</NOTE>They are taken several ways: sometimes in log-traps, baited with poplar sticks, laid in a path near the water. The <HI>Indians</HI> always wash their hands before they bait the traps, otherwise the sagacious animal is sure to shun the snare.</P>
<P>Sometimes they are shot, either while they are at work, or at food, or in swimming across the rivers. But these methods are used only in summer, and not much practised; for the skins in that season are far less valuable than in the winter. At that time they are taken in nets placed above and below their houses, across the creeks, on stakes. If the water is frozen, the ice is cut from shore to shore, in order to put down the stakes. When the net is set, the <HI>Indians</HI> send their women to the Beaver-houses to disturb the animals; who dart into the water, and are usually taken in the net, which is instantly hauled up; and put down again with all expedition. If the Beaver misses the net, it sometimes returns to its house, but oftener into the vaults on the sides of the banks; but the poor creature seldom escapes, be∣ing pursued into all his retreats, the houses being broke open, and the vaults searched by digging along the shores.</P>
<P>The value of the fur of these animals, in the manufacture of hats, is well known. It began to be in use in <HI>England</HI> in the reign of <HI>Charles</HI> I.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rymer's Faedera, <HI>xx. 230.</HI></NOTE>, when the manufacture was regulated, in 1638, by procla∣mation; in which is an express prohibition of using any materials ex∣cept <HI>Beaver stuff,</HI> or <HI>Beaver wool;</HI> and the hats called demi-castors were forbidden to be made, unless for exportation.</P>
<P>This caused a vast encrease of demand for the skins of the Beavers. The <HI>Indians,</HI> on the discovery of <HI>America,</HI> seem to have paid very
<PB N="105" REF="326"/>
little attention to them, amidst the vast variety of beasts they at that time possessed, both for food and cloathing. But about the period of the fashion of hats, they became an article of commerce, and object of chase. The southern colonies soon became exhausted of their Beavers; and of later years the traffic has been much confined to <HI>Ca∣nada</HI> and <HI>Hudson's Bay.</HI> The importance of this trade, and the ra∣vages made among the animal creation in those parts, will appear by the following state of the imports into the ports of <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Rochelle</HI> in 1743. I take that year, as I have no other comparative state:</P>

<P>This great balance in favor of the <HI>French</HI> arises not only from their superior honesty in their dealings with the ignorant <HI>Indians,</HI> but the advantageous situation of <HI>Canada</HI> for the fur trade. They had both sides of the river St. <HI>Lawrence;</HI> the country round the five great lakes; and the countries bordering on the rivers flowing into them; and finally, the fine fur countries bordering on the <HI>Hudson's Bay</HI> company, many of whose waters falling into the St. <HI>Lawrence,</HI> gave an easy conveyance of those commodities to <HI>Montreal;</HI> where a fair is annually kept, with all the savage circumstances attendant on <HI>Indian</HI> concourse.</P>
<P>The traffic carried on in <HI>Hudson's Bay</HI> is chiefly brought from the chain of lakes and rivers that empty themselves into the bay at <HI>Nelson</HI>'s river, running southerly from lat. 56 to lat. 45. Lake <HI>Pachegoia</HI> is the most northerly: there the <HI>Indians</HI> rendezvous in <HI>March,</HI> to make their canoes for the transportation of the furs; for at that season the bark of the birch-tree separates very easily from the wood.</P>

<P>These animals are in some parts of <HI>America</HI> called the Little Beaver, on account of its form, and some parts of its oeconomy. From its scent it is styled the Musk Rat, and Musquash.

<P>It is found from <HI>Hudson's Bay</HI> to as low at lest as <HI>Carolina</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lawson, <HI>120.</HI></NOTE>. Like the Beaver, it forms its house of a round shape, covered with a dome, and constructed with herbs and reeds cemented with clay. At the bottom and sides are several pipes, through which they pass in search of food; for they do not lay in a stock of provision, like the former. They also form subterraneous passages, into which they retreat whenever their houses are attacked.</P>
<P>These houses are only intended for winter habitations; are deserted, and rebuilt annually. During summer, they live in pairs, and bring forth their young from three to six at a time. At approach of win∣ter, they construct their houses, and retire into them, in order to be protected from the inclemency of the season. Several families occupy the same dwelling, which is oft-times covered many feet with snow and ice; but they creep out and feed on the roots which lie beneath. They are very fond of the <HI>Acorus Verus,</HI> or <HI>Calamus Aromaticus</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Lawson, <HI>120.</HI></NOTE>. This perhaps gives them that strong musky smell these animals are so remarkable for; which they lose during winter, probably when this species of plant is not to be got. They also feed on the fresh-water Mussels. They feed too on fruit; for <HI>Kalm</HI> says, that apples are the baits used for them in traps. We may add, that in winter they eat the roots of nettles, and in summer, strawberries and rasberries<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Charlevoix, <HI>v. 158.</HI></NOTE>, during which time it is rare to see the male and female separate.</P>
<P>The flesh is sometimes eaten. The fur is made use of in the ma∣nufacture of hats. The Musk-bag is sometimes put among cloths, to preserve them from worms or insects</P>

<P>PORCUPINE. With short ears, hid in the fur: hair on the head, body, legs, and upper part of the tail, long, soft, and of a dark brown color; but sometimes found white: on the upper part of the head, body, and tail, are numbers of strong sharp quils; the longest, which are those on the back, are three inches long; the shortest are towards the head and on the sides, and concealed in the hair; mixed with them are certain stiff straggling hairs, at lest three inches longer than the others, tipt with dirty white: the under side of the tail is white.</P>
<P>On each fore foot are four toes; on the hind five; all armed with long claws, hollowed on the under side.</P>
<P>The size of one, which Sir JOSEPH BANKS brought from <HI>Newfound∣land,</HI> was about that of a Hare, but more compactly made; the back arched; and the whole form resembling that of the Beaver: the tail is six inches long, which, in walking, is carried a little bent upwards.</P>
<P>This species inhabits <HI>America,</HI> from <HI>Hudson's Bay</HI> to <HI>Canada</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Charlevoix, <HI>v. 198.</HI></NOTE>, <HI>New∣foundland, New England,</HI> and, but rarely, as far south as <HI>Virginia</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Catesby, App. <HI>xxx.</HI></NOTE>. <HI>Lawson</HI> makes no mention of it among the animals of <HI>Carolina.

<P>They are found in great plenty about <HI>Hudson's Bay,</HI> where the trad∣ing <HI>Indians</HI> depend much on them for food. They are reckoned ex∣cellent eating, even by the <HI>Europeans,</HI> tasting, when roasted, like suck∣ing-pig.
<PB N="110" REF="331"/>
The bones, during winter, are of a greenish yellow, owing, as is supposed, to their feeding during that season on the bark of the pine. It is observed, that the bones of animals sometimes take a tincture from their diet; for example, those of beasts which feed on madder become red<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Phil. Trans. <HI>lxii. 374.</HI></NOTE>. They are also very fond of the bark of ju∣niper. In summer, they live on the wild fruits, and lap water, but will not go into it. In winter, take snow by way of beverage.</P>
<P>They nestle under the roots of great trees, and will also, in quest of fruits, ascend the boughs. When the <HI>Indians</HI> discover one in a tree, they cut it down, and kill the animal by a blow on the nose.</P>
<P>They defend themselves with their quills. They fly from their pursuer; but when they cannot escape, will sidle towards their ene∣my, in order to push their quils into him: they are but weak instru∣ments of offence; for a small stroke with the hand against the grain will bring them from the skin, leaving them sticking slightly in the flesh. The <HI>Indians</HI> use them to make holes in their noses and ears, for the placing their nose and ear-rings, and other finery<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Drage's voy. <HI>i. 177.</HI></NOTE>. They also trim the edges of their deer-skin habits with fringes of dyed quils<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">The same, 191.</NOTE>, or make pretty linings with them for the bark boxes.</P>

<P>Inhabits <HI>Bohemia, Austria,</HI> and <HI>Hungary,</HI> and in the <HI>Russian</HI> empire; begins to be common about the <HI>Occa,</HI> east of <HI>Moscow;</HI> extends over all the temperate and open parts of <HI>Sibiria,</HI> and about <HI>Jakutsk,</HI> and in <HI>Kamtschatka.</HI> It is also on the island of <HI>Kadjak,</HI> and was seen in great numbers by <HI>Steller</HI> on <HI>Schamagin</HI>'s isles, almost close on the shore of <HI>North America,</HI> which give it place in this part of the work.</P>
<P>They burrow, and sink the pipes to their retreats obliquely,<NOTE PLACE="marg">MANNERS.</NOTE> and then winding; and at the end is an arched oblong chamber, a foot in diameter, strewed with dried grass. The entrances, or pipes, of the males are of greater, and those of the females of lesser, diameters. Towards winter they make a new pipe to their nest, but that only reaches to the turf; and with the earth which is taken out they fill up the summer pipe.</P>
<P>They live entirely in a state of solitude, unless in the amorous season, when the females are found in the same burrows with the males; but they bring forth in their own burrows, and by that means prevent the males from destroying the young, as they cannot enter by reason of the narrowness of the pipes, the males being superior in size to their mates. They sleep all night; but in the morning quit their holes, especially in fine weather, and feed and sport till approach of night. If the males approach one another, they fight sharply. The females often set up a very sharp whistle; the males are, for the most part, silent. At the sight of a man, they
<PB N="114" REF="335"/>
instantly run into their burrows; and are often seen standing upright, and looking about them, as if on the watch: and if they spy any body, give a loud whistle, and disappear.</P>
<P>They are very easily tamed, and become very sportive and amus∣ing; and are very fond of being stroked and cherished. In this state they will eat grain, and many sorts of herbs. In a wild state they prey on mice, and small birds, as well as vegetables. <HI>Gmeli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> says, that in <HI>Sibiria</HI> they inhabit granaries; but I do not find it con∣firmed by Doctor <HI>Pallas. Gmelin</HI> adds, that those who frequent granaries, seek for prey during the whole winter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Voyage en Sibirie, <HI>i. 378.</HI></NOTE>: as to the others, they certainly remain torpid all the severe season, and revive on the melting of the snows.</P>
<P>They bring forth from three to eight at a time. The young grow very quick, and desert the maternal burrows in the summer.</P>
<P>Their enemies are all sorts of Weesels, which dig them out of their holes. More males than females perish, as the latter are fiercer, and defend themselves much better. During day they are snatched up by hawks and hungry crows.</P>
<P>In some places they are taken in snares, for the sake of their skins, which are usually sent to <HI>China.</HI> The <HI>Kamtschatkans</HI> make most ele∣gant garments and hoods of them; specimens of the latter are pre∣served in the <HI>Leverian Museum.</HI> In <HI>Sibiria</HI> their flesh is esteemed a great delicacy, especially in autumn, when they are a lump of fat.</P>

<P>SQUIRREL. With hair of a dull grey color, intermixed with black, and frequently tinged with dull yellow: belly white. But they vary, the body being sometimes of a fine uniform grey.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="338"/>This is the largest of the genus, and grows to half the size of a Rabbet.</P>
<P>In <HI>America</HI> I do not discover this animal farther north than <HI>New England</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Josselyn's voy. <HI>86.</HI></NOTE>; from whence they are found in vast numbers as far south as <HI>Louisiana</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Bossu,</HI> i. 361.</NOTE>. These, and the other species of Squirrels, are the greatest pests to the farmers of <HI>North America.</HI> They swarm in se∣veral of the provinces, and often descend in troops from the back settlements, and join the rest in their ravages on the plantations of mayz, and the various nuts and mast which that fertile country produces.</P>
<P>Those which migrate from the mountains generally arrive in au∣tumn; instantly clear the ground of the fallen acorns, nuts, and mast, and form with them magazines for their winter provisions, in holes which they dig under ground for that purpose. They are often robbed of their hoards; for the colonists take great pains to find them out; and oft-times the hogs, which rove about the woods, root up and devour their magazines. It is from these that they supply themselves, from time to time, with provisions, quitting their nests, and returning with a sufficient stock to last them for some space; it being observed, that during winter they do not care to quit their warm retreat, unless on a visit to their storehouses; therefore, when∣ever they are observed to run about the woods in greater numbers than usual, it is a certain sign of the near approach of severe cold; for instinct directs them to lay in a greater stock than usual, least the inclemency of the weather should deprive them of access to their subterraneous magazines.</P>
<P>The damage which they do to the poor planters, by destroying the mayz, is incredible. They come by hundreds into the fields, climb up the stalks, and eat the sweet corn wrapt up in the heads, and will destroy a whole plantation in a night. For this reason they were proscribed. In some places the inhabitants were, each, obliged an∣nually to bring in four Squirrels heads. In others, a sum was given,
<PB N="118" REF="339"/>
about three pence, for every one that was killed. This proved such an encouragement, as to set all the idle people in the province in pursuit of them. <HI>Pensylvania</HI> paid, from <HI>January</HI> 1749 to <HI>January</HI> 1750, 8000l. currency: but on complaint being made by the depu∣ties, that their treasuries were exhausted by these rewards, they were reduced to one half. How improved must the state of the <HI>Americans</HI> then be, in thirty-five years, to wage an expensive and successful war against its parent country, which before could not bear the charges of clearing the provinces from the ravages of these insignificant ani∣mals!</P>
<P>It has been observed, that the Squirrels are greatly multiplied within these few years, and that in proportion to the encrease of the fields of mayz, which attract them from all parts; I mean not only the grey species, but all the others.</P>
<P>They are eaten by some people, and are esteemed very delicate. Their skins, in <HI>America,</HI> are used for ladies shoes; and are often im∣ported into <HI>England,</HI> for lining or facing for cloaks.</P>
<P>They make their nests in hollow trees, with moss, straw, wool, and other warm materials. They chiefly inhabit trees of the deciduous kind; but sometimes in pines, whose cones are an article of their provision. They keep their nests for several days together, seldom stirring out, except for a fresh supply of food. Should a deep snow prevent them from getting to their storehouses, multitudes perish with hunger.</P>
<P>When they are sitting on a bough, and perceive a man, they in∣stantly move their tails backward and forward, and gnash their teeth with a very considerable noise. This makes them detested by the sportsmen, who lose their game by the alarm they give. The GREY Squirrel is a difficult animal to kill: it sits on the highest trees, and often between the boughs, and changes its place with such expedi∣tion that the quickest marksman can scarcely find time to level his piece; and if it can once get into a hole, or into any old nest, nothing
<PB N="119" REF="340"/>
can provoke it to get out of its asylum. They run up and down the bodies of trees, but very rarely leap from one to the other.</P>
<P>They are easily made tame; will even be brought to play with cats and dogs, which in a state of domesticity will not hurt them. They will also attach themselves so far as to follow children to and from the woods.</P>
<P>They agree in their manner of feeding with the <HI>European</HI> kinds; and have all the same sort of attitudes.</P>
<P>SQUIRREL. With coarse fur,<NOTE PLACE="marg">β. CAT.</NOTE> mixed with dirty white and black: the throat, and inside of the legs and thighs, black: the tail is much shorter than is usual with Squirrels, and of a dull yellow, mixed with black: in size equal to that of the Grey.</P>
<P>Inhabits <HI>Virginia.</HI> Mr. <HI>Knaphan,</HI> in whose collection I found it, informed me, that the planters called it the <HI>Cat</HI> Squirrel.</P>
<P>I suspect that this animal is only a variety. <HI>Lawson</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hist.

<P>They live in hollow trees. Like the <HI>Dormouse,</HI> they sleep the whole day; but towards night creep out, and are very lively and active. They are gregarious, numbers being found in one tree. By means of the lateral membranes, they take prodigious leaps, im∣properly called flying; and can spring ten yards at an effort. When they would leap, they extend the hind legs, and stretch
<PB N="121" REF="342"/>
out the intervening skin, which producing a larger surface, makes the animals specifically lighter than they would otherwise be: even with all this advantage, they cannot keep in a strait line, but are urged downward with their weight. Sensible of this, they mount the tree in proportion to the distance of the leap they propose to take, least they should fall to the ground before they had reached a place of security.</P>
<P>They never willingly quit the trees, or run upon the ground, be∣ing constant residents of the branches. They go in troops of ten or twelve, and seem in their leaps, to people unaccustomed to them, like leaves blown off by the wind.</P>
<P>They bring three or four young at a time. They use the same food, and form their hoards like other Squirrels.</P>
<P>They are very easily tamed, and soon grow very familiar. They seem of a tender nature, and to love warmth, being very fond of creeping to the sleeve or pocket of the owner.

continued through all the Arctic countries, wheresoever wood is found; abounds throughout <HI>Sibiria,</HI> except in the north-east parts, and in <HI>Kamtschatka,</HI> where it ceases, by reason of the cessation of forests.</P>
<P>In all these countries they are red in summer, but at approach of winter change to various and elegant greys. Their furs are of ex∣quisite softness, and are the sorts known to us by the name of <HI>Petit Gris.</HI> In the more southerly parts of these cold climates, they retain a tinge of the summer red, and are less valuable. The change of color is effected gradually, as is its return in spring to its ferruginous coat.</P>
<P>It is very singular, that the alteration is not only performed in the severity of the open air, but even in the warmth of a stove. Dr. <HI>Pallas</HI> made the experiment on one which was brought to him on the 12th of <HI>September,</HI> and was at that time entirely red. About the 4th of <HI>October</HI> many parts of the body began to grow hoary; and at the time it happened to die, which was on the 4th of <HI>November,</HI> the whole body had attained a grey color, and the legs, and a small part of the face, had alone the reddish tinge<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Nov. Sp. Quad. <HI>373.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The varieties are as follow:—A blackish one, with the fur sooty tipt with red, and full black glossy tail, are common about lake <HI>Baikal,</HI> and the whole course of the <HI>Lena.</HI> Sir <HI>Ashton Lever</HI> is in possession of one of a jetty blackness, with a white belly: its ears, as well as those of all the <HI>Petit Gris,</HI> are adorned with very long tufts. These change in winter to a lead-color, and are taken in the thick <HI>Alpine</HI> forests, where the <HI>Pinus Cembra,</HI> or Stone Pines, abound. The skins of these are neglected by the <HI>Chinese,</HI> but greatly esteemed in <HI>Europe,</HI> especially the tails, for facings of dresses.</P>
<P>This variety is observed sometimes to migrate in amazing num∣bers from their lofty alpine abodes, compelled to it whenever there happens to be a scarcity of provision<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Nov. Sp. an. <HI>188.</HI></NOTE>. Swarms have appeared even
<PB N="124" REF="345"/>
in the town of <HI>Tomsk,</HI> in deserted houses, and in the towers of the forti∣fications; where numbers are taken alive, and of great size, by the children of the place.</P>
<P>A beautiful and large variety, about the <HI>Baraba,</HI> called the <HI>Teleu∣tian,</HI> is in great esteem for its beautiful grey color, like a Gull's back, with a silvery gloss, and finely undulated. Their summer color is usually dusky red, and the sides and feet black.

<P>A small variety of this, lesser even than the common kind, is met with about the neighborhood of the <HI>Kasym</HI> and <HI>Iset.</HI></P>
<P>A variety is also met with which change to a white color; and others again retain a white color both in winter and summer.</P>

<P>Inhabits the birch-woods of <HI>Finmark, Lapland, Finland, Lithuania,</HI> and <HI>Livonia.</HI> Is found in <HI>Asia,</HI> in the woods of the <HI>Urallian</HI> chain, and from thence to the river <HI>Kolyma.</HI> Nestles in the hollows of trees remote from the ground, where it makes its nest of the softest mosses.

in the day-time. Lives on the buds and catkins of the birch, and on the shoots and buds of pines, which give its juices a strong re∣sinous smell; and its excrements will burn strongly, with a pitchy scent. The last are always found at the root of the tree, as if the animal descended to ease nature. It seldom comes out in bad wea∣ther; but certainly does not remain torpid during winter; for it is often taken in the traps laid for the Grey Squirrels. The skins are often put up in the bundles with the latter, so that the purchaser is defrauded, as their fur is of no value. They leap at vast distances from tree to tree, and never descend but for the purpose before mentioned. By reason of similitude of color between them and the birch bark, they are seen with great difficulty, which preserves them from the attacks of rapacious birds.</P>
<P>They bring forth two, three, and rarely four, young at a time. When the parent goes out for food, she laps them carefully up in the moss. They are very difficult to be preserved, and seldom can be kept alive, by reason of want of proper food. They are born blind, and continue so fourteen days. The mother pays them great atten∣tion; broods over them, and covers them with its flying membrane. The <HI>Russians</HI> call them <HI>Ljetaga,</HI> or the <HI>Flying.</HI></P>

<P>They are extremely numerous: live in woods, yet never run up trees, except when pursued, and find no other means of escape. They live under ground, burrow, and form their habitations with two en∣trances, that they may secure a retreat through the one, in case the other should be stopped. These little animals form their subterra∣neous dwellings with great skill, working them into the form of long galleries, with branches on each side, every one terminating in an enlarged apartment, in which they hoard their stock of winter pro∣vision<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Kalm,</HI> i. 322. 325.</NOTE>.

<P>Those of <HI>Sibiria</HI> live chiefly on seeds, and particularly on the kernels of the <HI>Cembra,</HI> or Stone Pine; and these they hoard up in such quantities, that ten or fifteen pounds of the most choice have been found in a single magazine<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Pallas, Nov. Sp. an. <HI>379.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>They pass the whole winter either in sleep or in eating. During the severe season, they very rarely stir out, at lest as long as their provisions last; but if by an unexpected continuance of bad wea∣ther their provisions fail, they will then sally out, and dig under ground in cellars where apples are kept, or into barns where <HI>mayz</HI> is stored, and make great devastations. They will even enter houses, and eat undismayed, before the inhabitants, any corn they chance to meet with<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Du Pratz, <HI>ii. 68.</HI></NOTE>. The Cat makes great havock among them, being at all seasons as great an enemy to them as to domestic Mice. It is hunger alone that tames them. They are naturally of a very wild nature, will bite most severely, and cannot by any means be rendered familiar.</P>
<P>They are remarkably nice in the choice of their food, when the vari∣ety of autumnal provisions gives opportunity. They have been ob∣served, after having stuffed their pouches with the grains of rye, to fling it out when they meet with wheat, and to replace the rye with the more delicious corn.</P>
<P>Their skins, form a trifling article of commerce, being brought over among <HI>le menue pelliterie,</HI> the small furs, and used for the lining of ladies cloaks.</P>
<P>In <HI>Sibiria</HI> they are killed with blunt arrows, or caught in fall-traps. About the <HI>Lena,</HI> the boys go out in the amorous season of these little animals, and, standing behind a tree, mimic the noise of the females, which brings the males within reach of their sticks, with which

In violent frosts they lie torpid; and in the inhabited parts of the country they are observed to redouble their screaks before se∣vere weather, as if they had some presage from their constitutions.</P>
<P>By Mr. <HI>Bartram</HI>'s observations it appears very certain, that these animals are natives of <HI>America.</HI> They are found even at present in the most desolate places, as well as in the houses and barns of the inhabited parts. It is unknown in <HI>Europe,</HI> that either the common Rat or Mouse ever deserted the haunts of mankind, for rocks and deserts: they therefore have been there from the earliest times.

<P>Inhabits in vast abundance <HI>Sibiria,</HI> from the east side of the <HI>Ural∣lian</HI> chain, even within the Arctic circle, and quite to <HI>Kamtschatka.</HI> It is the noted <HI>Tegultschitch</HI> of that country, distinguished by its cu∣rious oeconomy and by its vast migrations.</P>
<P>They make their burrows with the greatest skill, immediately be∣low the surface of the soft turfy soil. They form a chamber of a flattish arched form, of a small height, and about a foot in diameter, to which they sometimes add as many as thirty small pipes or entrances. Near the chamber they often form other caverns, in which they lodge their winter stores: these consist of various kinds of plants, even some of species poisonous to mankind. They gather them in sum∣mer, harvest them, and even at times bring them out of the cells to give them a more thorough drying in the sun. The chief labor rests on the females. The males, during summer, go about solitary, and inhabit some old nests; and in that season never touch their hoards, but live on berries. They are monogamous, and the male and female at other times found in the same nest. The female brings two or three young at a time, and breeds often in the year.</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="356"/>No little animals are so respected by the <HI>Kamtschatkans</HI> as these, for to them they owe a delicious food; and with great joy, about autumn, rob the hoards, and leave there many ridiculous presents by way of amends: they also never take the whole of their provisions, and leave besides a little dried ovaries of fish for their support.</P>
<P>But the migrations of these Mice, in certain years,<NOTE PLACE="marg">MIGRATIONS.</NOTE> is as extraordi∣nary a fact as any in natural history: I will only mention those of <HI>Kamtschatka.</HI> The cause is unknown. Doctor <HI>Pallas</HI> thinks it may arise from the sensations of internal fire in that vulcanic tract, or a prescience of some unusual and bad season. They gather together in the spring in amazing numbers, except the few that are conversant about villages, where they can pick up some subsistance. This makes it probable that the country is over-stocked, and they quit it for want of food. The mighty host proceeds in a direct course west∣ward, and with the utmost intrepidity swims over rivers, lakes, and even arms of the sea: many are drowned, many destroyed by water∣fowl, or rapacious fish; those which escape rest awhile, to bask, dry their fur, and refresh themselves. If the inhabitants find them in that situation, they treat them with the utmost tenderness, and endeavour to bring them to life and vigor. As soon as they have crossed the river <HI>Penschim,</HI> at the head of the gulph of the same name, they turn southward, and reach the rivers <HI>Judoma</HI> and <HI>Ochot</HI> by the middle of <HI>July.</HI> The space is most surprising, on consulting the map of the country. The flocks are also so numerous, that an observer has waited two hours to see them all pass. Their return into <HI>Kamtschatka,</HI> in <HI>October,</HI> is attended with the utmost festivity and welcome. The natives consider it as a sure prognostic of a successful chase and fishery: the first is certain, as the Mice are always followed by mul∣titudes of beasts of prey. They equally lament their migration, as the season is certainly filled with rains and tempests.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">MANNERS.</NOTE>They are gregarious, and sometimes have been found together in thousands; are very shy, and avoid the haunts of mankind. They usually are seen on the floating ice, preferring that for their residence, as their bodies require cooling, by reason of the heat which arises from their excessive fatness<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Nov. Com. Petrop. <HI>ii. 291.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="368"/>They are monogamous; couple in <HI>June,</HI> and bring forth in the earliest spring<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Faun. Greenl. <HI>4.</HI></NOTE>. They bring one <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Barentz, <HI>4.</HI></NOTE>, or very rarely two young at a time; feed on sea-plants, fish, and shells, which they either dig out of the sand, or force from the rocks with their great teeth. They make use also of their teeth to ascend the islands of ice, by fastening them in the cracks, and by that means draw up their bodies.</P>
<P>They sleep both on the ice and in the water, and snore excessively loud<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Martens, <HI>109.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>They are harmless, unless provoked; but when wounded, or at∣tacked, grow very fierce, and are very vindictive. When surprised upon the ice, the females first provide for the safety of the young, by flinging it into the sea, and itself after it, carrying it to a secure distance, then returning with great rage to revenge the injury. They will sometimes attempt to fasten their teeth on the boats, with an intent to sink them, or rise in numbers under them to overset them; at the same time they shew all marks of rage, by roaring in a dreadful manner, and gnashing their teeth with great violence; if once thoroughly irritated, the whole herd will follow the boats till they lose sight of them. They are strongly attached to each other, and will make every effort in their power, even to death, to set at liberty their harpooned companions<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Martens, <HI>110.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>A wounded Walrus has been known to sink to the bottom, rise suddenly again, and bring up with it multitudes of others, who united in an attack on the boat from which the insult came<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Phipps's voy. <HI>57.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>They fling the water out of their nostrils, as the Whale does out of its head. When chased hard, they commonly vomit, and fling up small stones. Their dung is like that of a Horse, and excessively fetid, especially where they are found in large companies.</P>
<P>The tongue, which is about the size of a Cow's, may be eaten,<NOTE PLACE="marg">USES.</NOTE> if boiled fresh; but if kept, soon runs into oil. The teeth used to be applied to all the purposes of ivory; but the animals are now killed
<PB N="148" REF="369"/>
only for the sake of the oil. Seamen make rings of the bristles of the whiskers, which they wear as preservatives against the cramp. The <HI>French</HI> coach-makers have made traces for coaches of the skins, which are said to be strong and elastic<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">De Buffon.</NOTE>. The <HI>Russians</HI> formerly used the bone of the penis pulverised, as a remedy against the stone<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Worm.

The <HI>Greenlanders</HI> eat the flesh and lard, and use the last in their lamps. Of the skin they make straps. They split the tendons into thread; and use the teeth to head their darts, or to make pegs in their boats.</P>
<P>Their only enemies, besides mankind, are the Polar Bears, with whom they have dreadful conflicts. Their feuds probably arise from the occupancy of the same piece of ice. The Walrus is usually victorious, through the superior advantage of its vast teeth<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Egede, <HI>83.</HI></NOTE>. The effects of the battle are very evident; for it is not often that the hunters find a beast with two entire tusks<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Crantz, <HI>i. 126.</HI></NOTE>.</P>

<PB N="149" REF="370"/>
They are, when out of the water, very unwieldy, and move with great difficulty. They weigh from fifteen hundred to two thou∣sand pounds, producing, according to their size, from one to two barrels of oil, which is boiled out of the fat between the skin and the flesh. Immediately on their arrival, the females calve, and engender again in two months after; so that they carry their young about nine months. They never have more than two at a time, and seldom more than one.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The <HI>Echoueries</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This word is derived from <HI>Echouer,</HI> to land, or run on shore.</NOTE> are formed principally by nature, being a gradual slope of soft rock, with which the <HI>Magdalene</HI> islands abound, about eighty or a hundred yards wide at the water-side, and spreading so as to contain, near the summit, a very large number of these ani∣mals. Here they are suffered to come on shore, and amuse them∣selves for a considerable time, till they acquire a degree of bold∣ness, being at their first landing so exceedingly timid as to make it impossible for any person to approach them.</Q></P>
<P><Q>In a few weeks they assemble in great multitudes: formerly, when undisturbed by the <HI>Americans,</HI> to the amount of seven or eight thousand. The form of the <HI>Echouerie</HI> not allowing them to re∣main contiguous to the water, the foremost are insensibly pushed above the slope. When they are arrived at a convenient distance, the hunters, being provided with a spear sharp on one side, like a knife, with which they cut their throats, take advantage of a side wind, or a breeze blowing obliquely upon the shore, to prevent the animals from smelling them, because they have that sense in great perfection. Having landed, the hunters, with the assistance of good dogs, trained for that purpose, in the night-time endea∣vour to separate those which are most advanced from the others, driving them different ways. This they call <HI>making a cut;</HI> it is generally looked upon to be a most dangerous process, it being impossible to drive them in any particular direction, and difficult to avoid them; but as the Walruses, which are advanced above

the slope of the <HI>Echouerie,</HI> are deprived by the darkness of the night from every direction to the water, they are left wandering about, and killed at leisure, those that are nearest the shore being the first victims. In this manner have been killed fifteen or six∣teen hundred at a <HI>cut.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>The people then skin them, and take off a coat of fat which al∣ways surrounds them, and dissolve it into oil. The skin is cut into slices of two or three inches wide, and exported to <HI>America</HI> for carriage traces, and into <HI>England</HI> for glue. The teeth make an inferior sort of ivory, and is manufactured for that purpose; but very soon turns yellow.</Q></P>

<Q><P>Seals are more needful to them than Sheep are to us,<NOTE PLACE="marg">THEIR GREAT USE TO THE GREENLANDERS.</NOTE> though they furnish us with food and raiment; or than the cocoa-tree is to the <HI>Indians,</HI> although that presents them not only with meat to eat, and covering for their bodies, but also houses to dwell in, and boats to fail in, so that in case of necessity they could live solely from it. The Seals flesh (together with the Rein-deer, which is already grown pretty scarce) supplies the natives with their most palatable and sub∣stantial food. Their fat furnishes them with oil for lamp-light, cham∣ber and kitchen fire; and whoever sees their habitations, presently
<PB N="152" REF="373"/>
finds, that if they even had a superfluity of wood, it would not do, they can use nothing but train in them. They also mollify their dry food, mostly fish, in the train; and finally, they barter it for all kinds of necessaries with the factor. They can few better with fibres of the Seals sinews than with thread or silk. Of the skins of the entrails they make their windows, curtains for their tents, shirts, and part of the bladders they use at their harpoons; and they make train bottles of the maw. Formerly, for want of iron, they made all manner of instruments and working-tools of their bones. Neither is the blood wasted, but boiled with other ingre∣dients, and eaten as soup. Of the skin of the Seal they stand in the greatest need; for, supposing the skins of Rein-deer and birds would furnish them with competent cloathing for their bodies, and coverings for their beds; and their flesh, together with fish, with sufficient food; and provided they could dress their meat with wood, and also new model their house-keeping, so as to have light, and keep themselves warm with it too; yet without the Seals skins they would not be in a capacity of acquiring these same Rein-deer, fowls, fishes, and wood; because they must cover over with Seal-skin both their large and small boats, in which they travel and seek their provision. They must also cut their thongs or straps out of them, make the bladders for their harpoons, and cover their tents with them; without which they could not subsist in summer.</P>
<P>Therefore no man can pass for a right <HI>Greenlander</HI> who cannot catch Seals. This is the ultimate end they aspire at, in all their device and labor from their childhood up. It is the only art (and in truth a difficult and dangerous one it is) to which they are trained from their infancy; by which they maintain themselves, make themselves agreeable to others, and become beneficial mem∣bers of the community<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hist. Greenl. <HI>i. 130.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="374"/>The <HI>Greenlanders</HI> have three ways of catching Seals:<NOTE PLACE="marg">MANNER OF TAKING.</NOTE> either sing∣ly, with the bladder; or in company, by the <HI>clapper-hunt;</HI> or in the winter on the ice: whereto may be added the shooting them with a gun.</P>
<P>The principal and most common way is the taking them with the bladder. When the <HI>Greenlander</HI> sets out equipped according to the 7th Section, and spies a Seal, he tries to surprise it una∣wares, with the wind and sun in his back, that he may not be heard or seen by it. He tries to conceal himself behind a wave, and makes hastily, but softly, up to it, till he comes within four, five, or six fathom of it; mean while he takes the utmost care that the harpoon, line, and bladder, lie in proper order. Then he takes hold of the oar with his left hand, and the harpoon with his right by the hand-board, and so away he throws it at the Seal, in such a manner that the whole dart flies from the hand-board and leaves that in his hand. If the harpoon hits the mark, and buries itself deeper than the barbs, it will directly disengage itself from the bone-joint, and that from the shaft; and also un∣wind the string from its lodge on the <HI>kajak.</HI> The moment the Seal is pierced, the <HI>Greenlander</HI> must throw the bladder, tied to the end of the string, into the water, on the same side as the Seal runs and dives; for that he does instantly, like a dart. Then the <HI>Greenlander</HI> goes and takes up the shaft swimming on the water, and lays it in its place. The Seal often drags the bladder with it under water, though 'tis a considerable impediment, on account of its great bigness; but it so wearies itself out with it, that it must come up again in about a quarter of an hour to take breath. The <HI>Greenlander</HI> hastens to the spot where he sees the bladder rise up, and smites the Seal, as soon as it appears, with the great lance described in the 6th Section<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the Sections referred to, and tab. v.</NOTE>. This lance always comes out of its body again; but he throws it at the creature afresh every time it comes up, till 'tis quite spent. Then he runs the
<PB N="154" REF="375"/>
little lance into it, and kills it outright, but stops up the wound directly to preserve the blood; and lastly, he blows it up, like a bladder, betwixt skin and flesh, to put it into a better capacity of swimming after him; for which purpose he fastens it to the left-side of his <HI>kajak,</HI> or boat<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See vol. i. 150. tab. viii.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In this exercise the <HI>Greenlander</HI> is exposed to the most and greatest danger of his life; which is probably the reason that they call this hunt, or fishery, <HI>kamavock,</HI> i. e. the Extinction, <HI>viz.</HI> of life. For if the line should entangle itself, as it easily may, in its sud∣den and violent motion; or if it should catch hold of the <HI>kajak,</HI> or should wind itself round the oar, or the hand, or even the neck, as it sometimes does in windy weather; or if the Seal should turn suddenly to the other side of the boat; it cannot be otherwise than that the <HI>kajak</HI> must be overturned by the string, and drawn down under water. On such desperate occasions the poor <HI>Greenlander</HI> stands in need of all the arts described in the former Section, to disentangle himself from the string, and to raise himself up from under the water several times successively; for he will continually be overturning till he has quite disengaged himself from the line. Nay, when he imagines himself to be out of all danger, and comes too near the dying Seal, it may still bite him in the face or hand; and a female Seal that has young, instead of flying the field, will sometimes fly at the <HI>Greenlander</HI> in the most vehement rage, and do him a mischief, or bite a hole in his <HI>kajak</HI> that he must sink.</P>
<P>In this way, singly, they can kill none but the careless stupid Seal, called <HI>Attarsoak</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See N<SUP>o</SUP> 77. of this work.</NOTE>. Several in company must pursue the cautious <HI>Kassigiak</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ditto, N<SUP>o</SUP> 72.</NOTE> by the <HI>clapper-hunt.</HI> In the same manner they also surround and kill the <HI>Attarsoit</HI> <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Ditto, a variety of N<SUP>o</SUP> 77.</NOTE> in great numbers at certain seasons of the year; for in autumn they retire into the creeks or inlets in stormy weather, as in the <HI>Nepiset</HI> sound in <HI>Ball</HI>'s river, between the main land and the island <HI>Kangek,</HI> which is full two
<PB N="155" REF="376"/>
leagues long, but very narrow. There the <HI>Greenlanders</HI> cut off their retreat, and frighten them under water by shouting, clapping, and throwing stones; but, as they must come up again continually to draw breath, then they persecute them again till they are tired, and at last are obliged to stay so long above water, that they sur∣round them, and kill them with the fourth kind of dart, described in the 6th Section. During this hunt we have a fine opportunity to see the agility of the <HI>Greenlanders,</HI> or, if I may call it so, their hussar-like manoeuvres. When the Seal rises out of the water, they all fly upon it, as if they had wings, with a desperate noise; the poor creature is forced to dive again directly, and the moment he does, they disperse again as fast as they came, and every one gives heed to his post, to see where it will start up again; which is an uncertain thing, and is commonly three quarters of a mile from the former spot. If a Seal has a good broad water, three or four leagues each way, it can keep the sportsmen in play for a couple of hours, before 'tis so spent that they can surround and kill it. If the Seal, in its fright, betakes itself to the land for a retreat, 'tis welcomed with sticks and stones by the women and children, and presently pierced by the men in the rear. This is a very lively and a very profitable diversion for the <HI>Greenlanders,</HI> for many times one man will have eight or ten Seals for his share.</P>
<P>The third method of killing Seals upon the ice, is mostly prac∣tised in <HI>Disko,</HI> where the bays are frozen over in the winter. There are several ways of proceeding. The Seals themselves make sometimes holes in the ice, where they come and draw breath; near such a hole a <HI>Greenlander</HI> seats himself on a stool, putting his feet on a lower one to keep them from the cold. Now when the Seal comes and puts its nose to the hole, he pierces it in∣stantly with his harpoon; then breaks the hole larger, and draws it out and kills it quite. Or a <HI>Greenlander</HI> lays himself upon his belly, on a kind of a sledge, near other holes, where the Seal
<PB N="156" REF="377"/>
come out upon the ice to bask themselves in the sun. Near this great hole they make a little one, and another <HI>Greenlander</HI> puts a harpoon into it with a very long shaft or pole. He that lies upon the ice looks into the great hole, till he sees a Seal com∣ing under the harpoon; then he gives the other the signal, who runs the Seal through with all his might.</P>
<P>If the <HI>Greenlander</HI> sees a Seal lying near its hole upon the ice, he slides along upon his belly towards it, wags his head, and grunts like a Seal; and the poor Seal, thinking 'tis one of its in∣nocent companions, lets him come near enough to pierce it with his long dart.</P>
<P>When the current wears a great hole in the ice in the spring, the <HI>Greenlanders</HI> plant themselves all round it, till the Seals come in droves to the brim to fetch breath, and then they kill them with their harpoons. Many also are killed on the ice while they lie sleeping and snoring in the sun<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">pp. 153, 4, 5, 6, 7.</NOTE>.</P></Q>
<P>Nature has been so niggardly in providing variety of provision for the <HI>Greenlanders,</HI> that they are necessitated to have recourse to such which is offered to them with a liberal hand.<NOTE PLACE="marg">USES IN KAMT∣SCHATKA.</NOTE> The <HI>Kamtschatkan</HI> na∣tions, which enjoy several animals, as well as a great and abundant choice of fish, are so enamoured with the taste of the fat of Seals, that they can make no feast without making it one of the dishes. Of that both <HI>Russians</HI> and <HI>Kamtschatkans</HI> make their candles. The latter eat the flesh boiled, or else dried in the sun. If they have a great quantity, they preserve it in the following manner:</P>
<P>They dig a pit of a requisite depth, and pave it with stones; then fill it with wood, and set it on fire so as to heat the pit to the warmth of a stove. They then collect all the cinders into a heap. They strew the bottom with the green wood of alder, on which they place separately the flesh and the fat, and put between every layer branches of the same tree; when the pit is filled they cover it with sods, so that the vapour cannot escape. After some hours they take out both
<PB N="157" REF="378"/>
fat and flesh, and keep it for winter's provisions, and they may be preserved a whole year without spoiling.</P>
<P>The <HI>Kamtschatkans</HI> have a most singular ceremony.<NOTE PLACE="marg">SUPERSTITIOUS CUSTOM.</NOTE> After they take the flesh from the heads of the Seals, they bring a vessel in form of a canoe, and fling into it all the sculls, crowned with certain herbs, and place them on the ground. A certain person enters the habita∣tion with a sack filled with <HI>Tonchitche,</HI> sweet herbs, and a little of the bark of willow. Two of the natives then roll a great stone towards the door, and cover it with pebbles; two others take the sweet herbs and dispose them, tied in little packets. The great stone is to signify the sea-shore, the pebbles the waves, and the packets Seals. They then bring three dishes of a hash, called <HI>Tolkoucha;</HI> of this they make little balls, in the middle of which they stick the packets of herbs: of the willow-bark they make a little canoe, and fill it with <HI>Tolkoucha,</HI> and cover it with the sack. After some time, the two <HI>Kamtschatkans</HI> who had put the mimic Seals into the <HI>Tolkoucha,</HI> take the balls, and a vessel resembling a canoe, and draw it along the sand, as if it was on the sea, to convince the real Seals how agreeable it would be to them to come among the <HI>Kamtschatkans,</HI> who have a sea in their very <HI>jurts,</HI> or dwellings. And this they imagine will in∣duce the Seals to suffer themselves to be taken in great numbers. Various other ceremonies, equally ridiculous, are practised; in one of which they <HI>invoke the winds, which drive the Seals on their shores, to be propitious</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Descr. Kamtschatka, <HI>425.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>Besides the uses which are made of the flesh and fat of Seals, the skins of the largest are cut into soles for shoes. The women make their summer boots of the undressed skins, and wear them with the hair outmost. In a country which abounds so greatly in furs, very little more use is made of the skins of Seals in the article of dress than what has been mentioned<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The same, 41, 42. 424.</NOTE>. But the <HI>Koriaks,</HI> the <HI>Oloutores,</HI> and <HI>Tchutschi,</HI> form with the skins canoes and vessels of different sizes, some large enough to carry thirty people.</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="379"/>Seals swarm on all the coasts of <HI>Kamtschatka,</HI> and will go up the rivers eighty <HI>versts</HI> in pursuit of fish. They couple on the ice in <HI>April,</HI> and sometimes on the rocks, and even in the sea in calm weather. The <HI>Tungusi</HI> give the milk of these animals to their chil∣dren instead of physic.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">CAPTURE.</NOTE>The Seals in this country are killed by harpooning, by shooting, by watching the holes in the ice and knocking them on the head as they rise; or by placing two or three strong nets across one of the rivers which these animals frequent: fifty or more people assemble in canoes on each side of the nets, while others row up and down, and with great cries frighten the Seals into them. As soon as any are entangled, the people kill them with pikes or clubs, and drag them on shore, and divide them equally among the hunters; some∣times a hundred are taken at a time in this manner.</P>
<P>The navigators observed abundance of Seals about <HI>Bering</HI>'s island, but that they decreased in numbers as they advanced towards the straits; for where the Walruses abounded, the Seals grew more and more scarce.</P>
<P>I did not observe any Seal-skin garments among those brought over by the navigators, such as one might have expected among the <HI>Esquimaux</HI> of the high latitudes they visited, and which are so much in use with those of <HI>Hudson's Bay</HI> and <HI>Labrador.</HI> That species of dress doubtlessly was worn in the earliest times. These people wanted their historians;<NOTE PLACE="marg">MASSAGETAE CLOATHED IN SEAL-SKINS.</NOTE> but we are assured that the <HI>Massagetae</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Strabo,</HI> lib. xi. 781.</NOTE> cloathed them∣selves in the skins of Seals. They, according to <HI>D'anville,</HI> inhabited the country to the east of the <HI>Caspian</HI> sea, and the lake <HI>Aral;</HI> both of which waters abound with Seals.</P>
<P>Seals are now become a great article of commerce. The oil from the vast Whales is no longer equal to the demand for supplying the magnificent profusion of lamps in and round our capital. The chase of these animals is redoubled for that purpose; and the skins, properly tanned, are in considerable use in the manufactory of boots and shoes.</P>

<P>The <HI>Greenlanders</HI> cut out of the skin of this species thongs and lines, a finger thick, for the Seal-fishery. Its flesh is white as veal, and esteemed the most delicate of any: has plenty of lard, but does not yield much oil. The skins of the young are sometimes used to lie on.</P>

The great old ones swim very slowly.</P>
<P>In the seas of the north of <HI>Scotland</HI> is found a Seal twelve feet long.

<P>Does not exceed four feet in length.</P>
<P>Never frequents the high seas, but keeps on the fixed ice in the re∣mote bays near the frozen land; and when old never forsakes its haunts. Couples in <HI>June;</HI> brings forth in <HI>January,</HI> on the fixed ice, which is its proper element. In that it has a hole for the benefit of fishing; near that it remains usually solitary, rarely in pairs. Is very incautious, and often sleeps on the surface of the water, yielding itself a prey to the Eagle. Feeds on small fish, shrimps, and the like.

<P>SEAL. With hair of an uniform dirty white color, with a tinge of yellow, but never spotted; hairs erect, and interwoven; soft as that of a Hare, especially the young: head long: upper lip swell∣ing and thick: whiskers very strong and thick, ranged in fifteen rows, covering the whole front of the lip, so as to make it appear bearded: eyes blue, pupil black: teeth strong; four cutting teeth above, the same below<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mr. Lepechin</HI> compares the number of the teeth to that of another kind (our <HI>Harp Seal</HI>) which, he says, has only four teeth in the lower jaw.</NOTE>: fore feet short, and ending abrupt: the membranes of the hind feet even, and not waved: tail short and thick; its length four inches two lines.</P>

<P>SEAL. With four cutting teeth above, four below: fore feet like the human; the thumb long: the membranes on the hind feet extend beyond the claws: on the forehead of the male is a thick folded skin, ridged half the way up, which it can inflate and draw down like a cap, to defend its eyes against storms, waves, stones, and sand. The females and young have only the rudiment of this guard. It has two species of hair; the longest white, the shortest thick, black, and woolly, which gives it a beautiful grey color.</P>
<P>It grows to the length of eight feet. The <HI>Greenlanders</HI> call it <HI>Neitsek-soak</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Crantz, <HI>i. 25.</HI></NOTE>, or the Great <HI>Neitsek.</HI> It inhabits only the southern parts of their country, where it inhabits the high seas; but in <HI>April, May,</HI> and <HI>June,</HI> comes nearer to the land. Is polygamous; copulates with its body erect. Brings forth in <HI>April</HI> one young upon the ice. Keeps much on the great fragments, where it sleeps in an unguarded way. Bites hard: barks, and whines: grows very fierce on being wounded; but will weep on being surprized by the hunter. Fight among themselves, and inflict deep wounds. Feed on all kinds of greater fish. The skins of the young form the most elegant dresses for the women. The men cover their great boats with those of the old; they also cover their houses with them, and when they grow old convert them into sacks. They use the teeth to head hunting-spears. Of the gullet and intestines they make the sea-dresses. The stomach is made into a fishing-buoy.</P>
<P>It is also found in <HI>Newfoundland.</HI> Our Seal-hunters name it the <HI>Hooded</HI> Seal, and pretend they cannot kill it till they remove that integument. The <HI>Germans</HI> call it <HI>Klap-Mutz,</HI> from its covering its face as if with a cap.</P>

Is very incautious. Has great dread of the <HI>Physeter Microps,</HI> which forces it towards the shore. It is often surrounded by troops of hunters, who compel it even to land, where it is easily killed.</P>
<P>It is found also about <HI>Kamtschatka,</HI> being the third species men∣tioned by <HI>Steller.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">SIZE.</NOTE>It grows to the length of nine feet. The measurements of one de∣scribed by Mr. <HI>Lepechin</HI> are as follow—The length, from the nose to the tip of the tail, was six feet: the length of the tail five inches three lines: the girth of the thickest part of the body four feet eight.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">USES.</NOTE>The skin is used to cover trunks; that of the young, taken in the isle of <HI>Solovki,</HI> on the west side of the <HI>White Sea,</HI> is made into boots, and is excellent for keeping out water. The <HI>Greenlanders,</HI> in dressing the skins, curry off the hair, and leave some fat on the inside to ren∣der

them thicker. With these they cover their boats, and with the undressed skins their tents; and, when they can get no other, make use of them for cloathing.</P>
<P>The oil extracted from the blubber of this Seal is far the most valuable, being sweet, and so free from greaves as to yield a greater quantity than any other species. The flesh is black.</P>
<P>The <HI>Newfoundland</HI> Seal-hunters call it the <HI>Harp,</HI> or <HI>Heart</HI> Seal, and name the marks on the sides the saddle. They speak too of a brown sort, which they call <HI>Bedlemer,</HI> and believe to be the young of the former.</P>

The feet are furnished with five toes, with the rudiments of nails; but these are so entirely covered with a naked skin, as to be as much concealed as a hand is with a mitten.

It is observable that they never double the southern cape of the peninsula, or are found on the western side in the <HI>Penschinska</HI> sea: but their great resort has been observed to be to <HI>Bering</HI>'s islands. They are as regularly mi∣gratory as birds of passage.<NOTE PLACE="marg">MIGRATORY.</NOTE> They first appear off the three <HI>Kurili</HI> islands and <HI>Kamtschatka</HI> in the earliest spring. They arrive excessively fat; and there is not one female which does not come pregnant. Such which are then taken are opened, the young taken out and skinned. They are found in <HI>Bering</HI>'s island only on the western shore, being the part opposite to <HI>Asia,</HI> where they first appear on their migration from the south. They continue on shore three months, during which time the females bring forth. Excepting their employ of suck∣ling their young, they pass their time in total inactivity.<NOTE PLACE="marg">LONG SLEEP AND FASTING.</NOTE> The males sink into the most profound indolence, and deep sleep; nor are they ever roused, except by some great provocation, arising from an inva∣sion of their place, or a jealousy of their females. During the whole time they neither eat nor drink. <HI>Steller</HI> dissected numbers, without finding the lest appearance of food in their stomachs.</P>
<P>They live in families.<NOTE PLACE="marg">LIVE IN FAMI∣LIES.</NOTE> Every male is surrounded by a seraglio of from eight to fifty mistresses; these he guards with the jealousy of an eastern monarch. Each family keeps separate from the others, notwithstanding they lie by thousands on the shore. Every family, with the unmarried and the young, amount to about a hundred and twenty. They also swim in tribes when they take to the sea.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="389"/><NOTE PLACE="marg">AFFECTION TO∣WARDS THEIR YOUNG.</NOTE>The males shew great affection towards their young, and equal tyranny towards the females. The former are fierce in the protec∣tion of their offspring; and should any one attempt to take their cub, will stand on the defensive, while the female carries it away in her mouth. Should she happen to drop it, the male instantly quits its enemy, falls on her, and beats her against the stones till he leaves her for dead. As soon as she recovers, she crawls to his feet in the most suppliant manner, and washes them with her tears; he at the same time brutally insults her misery, stalking about in the most insolent manner. But if the young is entirely carried off, he melts into the greatest affliction, likewise sheds tears, and shews every mark of deep sorrow. It is probable that as the female brings only one, or at most two cubs, he feels his misfortune the more sensibly.</P>
<P>Those animals which are destitute of females, through age or im∣potence, or are deserted by them, withdraw themselves from society, and grow excessively splenetic, peevish, and quarrelsome; are very furious, and so attached to their antient stations, as to prefer death to the loss of them. They are enormously fat, and emit a most nauseous and rank smell. If they perceive another animal approach its seat, they are instantly roused from their indolence, snap at the encroacher,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CONFLICTS.</NOTE> and give battle. During the fight they insensibly in∣trude on the station of their neighbor. This creates new offence; so that at length the civil discord spreads through the whole shore, at∣tended with hideous growls, their note of war. They are very tenacious of life, and will live a fortnight after receiving such wounds as would soon destroy any other animal.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">CAUSES OF THEM.</NOTE>The particular causes of disputes among these irascible beasts are the following:—The first and greatest is, when an attempt is made to seduce any of their mistresses, or a young female of the family: a battle is the immediate consequence of the insult. The unhappy vanquished instantly loses his whole seraglio, who desert him for the victorious hero.</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="390"/>The invasion of the station of another, gives rise to fresh conflicts; and the third cause is the interfering in the disputes of others. The battles they wage are very tremendous; the wounds they inflict very deep, like the cut of a sabre. At the conclusion of an engagement they fling themselves into the sea to wash off the blood.</P>
<P>Besides their notes of war, they have several others.<NOTE PLACE="marg">NOTES.</NOTE> When they lie on shore, and are diverting themselves, they low like a Cow. After victory they chirp like a Cricket. On a defeat, or after receiving a wound, mew like a Cat.</P>
<P>Common Seals, and Sea Otters,<NOTE PLACE="marg">DREAD THE LEO∣NINE SEAL.</NOTE> stand in great awe of these ani∣mals, and shun their haunts. They again are in equal awe of the Leonine Seals, and do not care to begin a quarrel in their sight, dreading the intervention of such formidable arbitrators; who like∣wise possess the first place on the shore.</P>
<P>The great and old animals are in no fear of mankind,<NOTE PLACE="marg">FEAR NOT MAN∣KIND.</NOTE> unless they are suddenly surprized by a loud shout, when they will hurry by thousands into the sea, swim about, and stare at the novelty of their disturbers.</P>
<P>When they come out of the water, they shake themselves, and smooth their hair with their hind feet: apply their lips to those of the females, as if they meant to kiss them: lie down and bask in the sun with their hind legs up, which they wag as a Dog does its tail. Sometimes they lie on their back, sometimes roll themselves up in∣to a ball, and fall asleep. Their sleep is never so sound but they are awoke by the lest alarm; for their sense of hearing, and also that of smelling, is most exquisite.</P>
<P>They copulate, <HI>more humano,</HI> in <HI>July,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">COPULATION.</NOTE> and bring forth in the <HI>June</HI> following; so they go with young eleven months.<NOTE PLACE="marg">GESTATION.</NOTE> The cubs are as sportive as puppies; have mock fights, and tumble one another on the ground. The male parent looks on with a sort of compla∣cency, parts them, licks and kisses them, and seems to take a greater affection to the victor than to the others.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="391"/><NOTE PLACE="marg">SWIET SWIMMERS.</NOTE>They swim with amazing swiftness and strength, even at the rate of seven or eight miles an hour, and often on their back. They dive well, and continue a great while under water. If wounded in that element, they will seize on the boat, carry it with them with great impetuosity, and often will sink it.</P>
<P>When they wish to ascend the rocks, they fix their fore feet on them, arch their backs, and then draw themselves up.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">CAPTURE.</NOTE>The <HI>Kamtschatkans</HI> take them by harpooning, for they never land on their shore. To the harpoon is fastened a long line, by which they draw the animal to the boat after it is spent with fatigue; but in the chase, the hunters are very fearful of too near an approach, least the animal should fasten on and sink their vessel.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">USES.</NOTE>The uses of them are not great. The flesh of the old males is rank and nauseous; that of the females is said to resemble lamb; of the young ones roasted, a sucking pig. The skins of the young, cut out of the bellies of the dams, are esteemed for cloathing, and are sold for about three shillings and four pence each; those of the old for only four shillings.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">RE-MIGRATION.</NOTE>Their re-migration is in the month of <HI>September,</HI> when they depart excessively lean, and take their young with them. On their re∣turn, they again pass near the same parts of <HI>Kamtschatka</HI> which they did in the spring. Their winter retreats are quite unknown; it is probable that they are the islands between the <HI>Kurili</HI> and <HI>Japan,</HI> of which we have some brief accounts, under the name of <HI>Compagnie Land, States Land,</HI> and <HI>Jeso Gasima,</HI> which were discovered by <HI>Martin Uriel</HI> in 1642<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He sailed from the east side of <HI>Japan</HI> in the ship <HI>Castricom,</HI> visited the isle of <HI>Jeso,</HI> and discovered the islands which he called <HI>States Land</HI> and <HI>Company Land,</HI> the last not very remote from the most southern <HI>Kurili</HI> island. <HI>Recueil de voy. au Nord,</HI> iv. 1.</NOTE>. It is certain that by his account the natives em∣ploy themselves in the capture of Seals<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The same, 12.</NOTE>.

<PB N="171" REF="392"/>
to be our animals, especially as we can fix on no more convenient place for their winter quarters. They arrive along the shores of the <HI>Kurili</HI> islands, and part of those of <HI>Kamtschatka,</HI> from the south. They land and inhabit only the western side of <HI>Bering</HI>'s, isle, which faces <HI>Kamtschatka;</HI> and when they return in <HI>September,</HI> their route is due south, pointing towards the discoveries of <HI>Uriel.</HI> Had they mi∣grated from the south-east as well as the south-west, every isle, and every side of every isle, would have been filled with them; nor should we have found (as we do) such a constant and local residence.</P>

<P>They do not migrate like the former; but only change the place of residence, having winter and summer stations<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Nov. Com. Petrop. <HI>ii. 365.</HI></NOTE>. They live chiefly on rocky shores, or lofty rocks in the sea, which seem to have been torn away from the land by the violence of some earthquake<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Muller's voy. <HI>60.</HI></NOTE>. These they climb, and by their dreadful roaring are of use in foggy weather to warn navigators to avoid destruction.</P>
<P>They copulate in the months of <HI>August</HI> and <HI>September;</HI> go ten months, and bring only one at a time. The parents shew them little affection, often tread them to death through carelessness, and will suffer them to be killed before them without concern or resentment. The cubs are not sportive, like other young animals, but are almost always asleep. Both male and female take them to sea to learn them to swim; when wearied, they will climb on the back of their dam; but the male often pushes them off, to habituate them to the
<PB N="174" REF="395"/>
exercise. The <HI>Russians</HI> were wont to fling the cubs into the water, and they always swam back to shore.</P>
<P>The males treat the females with great respect, and are very fond of their caresses. They are polygamous, but content themselves with fewer wives than the former, having only from two to four apiece.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">FEAR MANKIND;</NOTE>The males have a terrible aspect, yet they take to flight on the first appearance of a human creature; and if they are disturbed from their sleep, seem seized with great horrors, sigh deeply in their at∣tempts to go away, fall into vast confusion, tumble down, and trem∣ble in such a manner as scarcely to be able to use their limbs. But if they are reduced to a strait, so as not possibly to effect an escape, they grow desperate, turn on their enemy with great fury and noise, and even put the most valiant to flight.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">UNLESS HABITU∣ATED.</NOTE>By use they lose their fear of men. <HI>Steller</HI> once lived for six days in a hovel amidst their chief quarters, and found them soon recon∣ciled to the sight of him. They would observe what he was doing with great calmness, lie down opposite to him, and suffer him to seize on their cubs. He had an opportunity of seeing their conflicts about their females; and once saw a duel between two males, which lasted three days, and one of them received above a hundred wounds. The Ursine Seals never interfered, but got out of the way as fast as possible. They even suffered the cubs of the former to sport with them without offering them the lest injury.</P>
<P>This species has many of the same actions with the former, in swimming, walking, lying, and scratching itself. The old bellow like Bulls;<NOTE PLACE="marg">NOTES.</NOTE> the young bleat like Sheep. <HI>Steller</HI> says, that from their notes he seemed like a rustic amidst his herds. The males had a strong smell, but were not near so fetid as the Ursine sort.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">FOOD.</NOTE>Their food is fish, the lesser Seals, Sea Otters, and other marine animals. During the months of <HI>June</HI> and <HI>July</HI> the old males almost entirely abstain from eating, indulge in indolence and sleep, and be∣come excessively emaciated.</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="396"/>The voyagers made use of them to subsist on,<NOTE PLACE="marg">USES.</NOTE> and thought the flesh of the young very savoury. The feet turned into jelly on be∣ing dressed, and in their situation were esteemed great delicacies. The fat was not oily; that of the young resembled the suet of mutton, and was as delicious as marrow. The skin was useful for straps, shoes, and boots.</P>
<P>The <HI>Kamtschatkans</HI> esteem the chase of these animals a generous diversion, and hold the man in highest honor,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHASE.</NOTE> in proportion to the number he has killed. Even these heroes are very cautious when they attack one of the animals on shore: they watch an opportunity when they find it asleep, approach it against the wind, strike their harpoon, fastened to a long thong, into its breast, while their comrades fasten one end to a stake, and that done, he takes to his heels with the utmost precipitation. They effect his destruction at a distance, by shooting him with arrows, or flinging their lances into him; and when exhausted, they venture to come near enough to knock him on the head with clubs.</P>
<P>When they discover one on the lonely rocks in the sea, they shoot it with poisoned arrows: unable to endure the pain of the wound, heightened by the salt-water, which it plunges into on the first re∣ceiving it, it swims on shore in the greatest agony. If they find a good opportunity, they transfix it with their weapons; if not, they leave it to die of the poison, which it infallibly does in twenty-four hours, and in the most dreadful agony<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Descr. Kamtschatka, <HI>377.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>They esteem it a great disgrace to leave any of their game behind: and this point of honor they often observe, even to their own de∣struction; for it happens that when they go in search of these ani∣mals to the isle of <HI>Alait,</HI> which lies some miles south-west of <HI>Lapatka</HI> promontory, they observe this principle so religiously, as to over∣load their boats so much, as to send them and their booty to the bottom; for they scorn to save themselves, at the expence of throw∣ing overboard any part<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Nov.

With a small oblong squarish head, hanging down: mouth small: lips doubled, forming an outward and inward lip: about the junction of the jaws a set of white tubular bristles, as thick as a pigeon's quil, which serve as strainers to permit the run∣ning out of the water, and to retain the food: the lips covered with strong bristles, which serve instead of teeth to crop the strong roots of marine plants: no teeth, but in each jaw a flat white oblong bone with an undulated surface, which being placed above and below, performs the use of grinders to comminute the food.</P>
<P>Nostrils placed at the end of the nose, and lined with bristles: no ears, only in their place a small orifice.</P>
<P>Eyes very small, not larger than those of a Sheep, hardly visible through the little round holes in the skin; the irides black; the pupil livid: tongue pointed and small.</P>
<P>The whole animal is of great deformity: the neck thick, and its union with the head scarcely discernible: the two feet, or rather fins, are fixed near the shoulders; are only twenty-six inches long; are destitute of toes, or nails, but terminate in a sort of hoof, concave beneath, lined with bristles, and fitted for digging in sand.</P>
<P>The outward skin is black, rugged, and knotty, like the bark of an aged oak: without any hair; an inch thick, and so hard as scarcely to be cut with an ax; and when cut, appears in the inside like ebony. From the nape to the tail it is marked with circular wrinkles rising into knots, and sharp points on the side. This skin covers the whole
<PB N="178" REF="399"/>
body like a crust, and is of singular use to the animal during winter, in protecting it against the ice, under which it often feeds, or against the sharp-pointed rocks, against which it is often dashed by the wintry storms. It is also an equal guard against the summer heats; for this animal does not, like most other marine creatures, feed at the bottom, but with part of the body exposed, as well to the rays of the sun as to the piercing cold of the frost. In fact, this inte∣gument is so essential to its preservation, that <HI>Steller</HI> has observed several dead on the shore, which he believes were killed by the ac∣cidental privation of it. The color of this skin, when wet, is dusky, when dried, quite black.</P>
<P>The tail is horizontally flat;<NOTE PLACE="marg">TAIL.</NOTE> black, and ending in a stiff fin, com∣posed of laminae like whale-bone, terminating with fibres near nine inches long. It is slightly forked; but both ends are of equal lengths, like the tail of a Whale.</P>
<P>It has two teats placed exactly on the breast. The milk is thick and sweet, not unlike that of a Ewe. These animals copulate <HI>more humano,</HI> and in the season of courtship sport long in the sea; the female feigning to shun the embraces of the male, who pursues her through all the mazes of her flight.</P>
<P>The body, from the shoulders to the navel, is very thick; from thence to the tail grows gradually more slender. The belly is very large; and, by reason of the quantity of entrails, very tumid.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">SIZE.</NOTE>These animals grow to the length of twenty-eight feet. The measurements of one somewhat lesser, as given by Mr. <HI>Steller,</HI> are as follow:</P>
<P>The length, from the nose to the end of the tail, twenty-four feet and a half: from the nose to the shoulders, or setting-on of the fins, four feet four. The circumference of the head, above the nostrils, two feet seven; above the ears, four feet: at the nape of the neck, near seven feet: at the shoulders, twelve: about the belly, above twenty: near the tail, only four feet eight: the extent of the tail, from point to point, six feet and a half.</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="400"/>The weight of a large one is eight thousand pounds.<NOTE PLACE="marg">WEIGHT. PLACE.</NOTE></P>
<P>Inhabits the shores of <HI>Bering</HI>'s and the other islands which inter∣vene between the two continents. They never appear off <HI>Kamtschatka,</HI> unless blown ashore by tempests, as they sometimes are about the bay of <HI>Awatscha.</HI> The natives style them <HI>Kapustnik,</HI> or cabbage-eaters, from their food. This genus has not been discovered in any other part of the northern hemisphere. That which inhabits the eastern side of <HI>South America,</HI> and some part of <HI>Africa,</HI> is of a dif∣ferent species. For the latter I can testify, from having seen one from <HI>Senegal.</HI> Its body was quite smooth; its tail swelled out in the middle, and sloped towards the end, which was rounded<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A figure of this species is given in <HI>De Buffon,</HI> xii. lvii. and <HI>Schreher,</HI> ii. tab. lxxx.</NOTE>. To support my other opinion, I can call in the faithful <HI>Dampier;</HI> who describes the body as perfectly smooth<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Voy.</HI> i. 33.</NOTE>: had it that striking inte∣gument which the species in question has, it could not have escaped his notice. Let me also add, that the size of those which that able seaman observed, did not exceed ten or twelve feet; nor the weight of the largest reach that of twelve hundred pounds<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I suspect that this species extends to <HI>Mindanao,</HI> for one kind is cer∣tainly found there<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Dampier, <HI>i. 321.</HI></NOTE>. It is met with much farther south; for I dis∣cover, in the collection of Sir JOSEPH BANKS, a sketch of one taken near <HI>Diego Rodriguez,</HI> vulgarly called <HI>Diego Rais,</HI> an isle to the east of <HI>Mauritius;</HI> and it may possibly have found its way through some northern inlet to the seas of <HI>Greenland;</HI> for Mr. <HI>Fabricius</HI> once dis∣covered in that country the head of one, half consumed, with teeth, exactly agreeing with those of this species<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot"><HI>Foun. Greenl.</HI> p. 6.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>These animals frequent the shallow and sandy parts of the shores,<NOTE PLACE="marg">MANNERS.</NOTE> and near the mouths of the small rivers of the island of <HI>Bering,</HI> seem∣ingly pleased with the sweet water. They go in herds: the old keep behind and drive their young before them: and some keep on their sides, by way of protection. On the rising of the tide they
<PB N="180" REF="401"/>
approach the shores, and are so tame as to suffer themselves to be stroked: if they are roughly treated, they move towards the sea; but soon forget the injury, and return.</P>
<P>They live in families near one another: each consists of a male and female, a half-grown young, and a new-born one. The families often unite, so as to form vast droves. They are monogamous. They bring forth a single young, but have no particular time of par∣turition; but chiefly, as <HI>Steller</HI> imagines, about <HI>autumn.</HI></P>
<P>They are most innocent and harmless in their manners, and most strongly attached to one another. When one is hooked, the whole herd will attempt its rescue: some will strive to overset the boat, by going beneath it; others will fling themselves on the rope of the hook and press it down, in order to break it; and others again will make the utmost efforts to force the instrument out of its wounded companion.</P>
<P>Their conjugal affection is most exemplary: a male, after using all its endeavours to release its mate which had been struck, pursued it to the very edge of the water; no blows could force it away. As long as the deceased female continued in the water, he persisted in his attendance; and even for three days after she was drawn on shore, and even cut up and carried away, was observed to remain, as if in expectation of her return.</P>
<P>They are most voracious creatures, and feed with their head under water, quite inattentive of the boats, or any thing that passes about them; moving and swimming gently after one another, with much of their back above water. A species of louse harbours in the roughness of their coats, which the Gulls pick out, sitting on them as Crows do on Hogs and Sheep. Every now and then they lift their nose out of the water to take breath, and make a noise like the snort∣ing of Horses. When the tide retires, they swim away along with it; but sometimes the young are left ashore till the return of the water: otherwise they never quit that element: so that in nature, as well as form, they approach the cetaceous animals, and are the link between Seals and them.</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="402"/>They were taken on <HI>Bering</HI>'s isle by a great hook fastened to a long rope. Four or five people took it with them in a boat,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CAPTURE.</NOTE> and rowed amidst a herd. The strongest man took the instrument, struck it into the nearest animal; which done, thirty people on shore seized the rope, and with great difficulty drew it on shore. The poor crea∣ture makes the strongest resistance, assisted by its faithful companions. It will cling with its feet to the rocks till it leaves the skin behind; and often great fragments of the crusty integument fly off before it can be landed. It is an animal full of blood; so that it spouts in amazing quantities from the orifice of the wound.</P>
<P>They have no voice; only, when wounded, emit a deep sigh.</P>
<P>They have the senses of sight and hearing very imperfect; or at lest neglect the use of them.</P>
<P>They are not migratory; for they were seen about <HI>Bering</HI>'s island the whole of the sad ten months which Mr. <HI>Steller</HI> passed there after his shipwreck.</P>
<P>In the summer they were very fat; in the winter so lean that the ribs might be counted.</P>
<P>The skin is used,<NOTE PLACE="marg">USES.</NOTE> by the inhabitants about the promontory <HI>Tchukt∣chi,</HI> to cover their boats. The fat,<NOTE PLACE="marg">THE FAT.</NOTE> which covers the whole body like a thick blubber, was thought to be as good and sweet as <HI>May</HI>-but∣ter: that of the young, like hogs-lard. The flesh of the old,<NOTE PLACE="marg">LEAN.</NOTE> when well boiled, resembled beef: that of the young, veal. The flesh will not refuse salt. The crew preserved several casks full, which was found of excellent service in their escape from their horrible con∣finement<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Muller's voy. <HI>62.</HI> Nov. Com.

<P>To this article must be added an imperfect description of a marine animal seen by Mr. <HI>Steller</HI> on the coast of <HI>America,</HI> which he calls a <HI>Sea Ape.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">SEA APE.</NOTE> The head appeared like that of a Dog, with sharp and upright ears, large eyes, and with both lips bearded: the body round and conoid; the thickest part near the head: the tail forked;
<PB N="182" REF="403"/>
the upper lobe the longest: the body covered with thick hair, grey on the back, reddish on the belly. It seemed destitute of feet.</P>
<P>It was extremely wanton, and played a multitude of monkey-tricks. It sometimes swam on one side, sometimes on the other side of the ship, and gazed at it with great admiration. It made so near an approach to the vessel, as almost to be touched with a pole; but if any body moved, it instantly retired. It would often stand erect for a considerable space, with one-third of its body above water; then dart beneath the ship, and appear on the other side; and repeat the same thirty times together. It would frequently arise with a sea-plant, not unlike the Bottle-gourd, toss it up, and catch it in its mouth, playing with it numberless fantastic tricks<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hist. Kamtschatka, <HI>136.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>On animals of this species the fable of the <HI>Sirens</HI> might very well be founded.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">SEA BELUGA.</NOTE>I shall conclude this article with a recantation of what I say in the 357th page of my Synopsis, relating to the <HI>Beluga;</HI> which I now find was collected, by the author I cite, from the reports of <HI>Cossacks,</HI> and ignorant fishermen. The animal proves at last to be one of the cetaceous tribe, of the genus of <HI>Dolphin,</HI> and of a species called by the <HI>Germans Wit-Fisch,</HI> and by the <HI>Russians Beluga</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Pallas, Itin. <HI>iii. 84. tab. iv.</HI> Crantz Greenl. <HI>i. 114.</HI> Purchas's Pilgrims, <HI>iii. 549.</HI></NOTE>; both signifying White fish: but to this the last add <HI>Morskaia,</HI> or <HI>of the sea,</HI> by way of distinguishing it from a species of Sturgeon so named. It is com∣mon in all the <HI>Arctic</HI> seas; and forms an article of commerce, being taken on account of its blubber. They are numerous in the gulph of St. <HI>Lawrence;</HI> and go with the tide as high as <HI>Quebec.</HI> There are fisheries for them, and the common <HI>Porpesse,</HI> in that river. A considerable quantity of oil is extracted; and of their skins is made a sort of Morocco leather, thin, yet strong enough to resist a musquet∣ball<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Charlevoix, <HI>v. 217.</HI></NOTE>. They are frequent in the <HI>Dwina</HI> and the <HI>Oby;</HI> and go in small families from five to ten, and advance pretty far up the rivers in pursuit of fish. They are usually caught in nets; but are some∣times
<PB N="183" REF="404"/>
harpooned. They bring only one young at a time, which is dusky; but grow white as they advance in age; the change first commencing on the belly. They are apt to follow boats, as if they were tamed; and appear extremely beautiful, by reason of their re∣splendent whiteness<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eaun. Greenl. <HI>51.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>It being a species very little known, and never well engraven, I shall give a brief description, and adjoin an engraving taken from an excellent drawing communicated to me by Dr. <HI>Pallas.</HI></P>
<P>The head is short: nose blunt: spiracle small,<NOTE PLACE="marg">DESCRIPTION.</NOTE> of the form of a crescent: eyes very minute: mouth small: in each side of each jaw are nine teeth, short, and rather blunt; those of the upper jaw are bent, and hollowed, fitted to receive the teeth of the lower jaw when the mouth is closed: pectoral fins nearly of an oval form: beneath the skin may be felt the bones of five fingers, which terminate at the edge of the fin in five very sensible projections. This brings it into the next of rank in the order of beings with the <HI>Manati.</HI> The tail is divided into two lobes, which lie horizontally, but do not fork, except a little at their base. The body is oblong, and rather slender, tapering from the back (which is a little elevated) to the tail. It is quite destitute of the dorsal fin.</P>
<P>Its length is from twelve to eighteen feet.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>IZE.</NOTE> It makes great use of its tail in swimming; for it bends that part under it, as a Lobster does its tail, and works it with such force as to dart along with the rapidity of an arrow.</P>
<P>A full account of the fish of the Whale kind, seen by the Reverend Dr. <HI>Borlase</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Obs. Scilly Islands, <HI>3.</HI></NOTE> between the <HI>Land's End</HI> and the <HI>Scilly</HI> islands, is a <HI>desideratum</HI> in the <HI>British</HI> Natural History. He describes them as being from twelve to fifteen feet long; some were milk-white, others brown, others spotted. They are called <HI>Thornbacks,</HI> from a sharp and broad fin on the back. This destroys my suspicion of their be∣ing of the above species.</P>
