<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>I AM as ready as the most rigid Critic, to confess, that nothing can be more sim∣ple and inartificial than the plans of the fol∣lowing Dramas. In the construction of them I have seldom ventured to introduce any persons <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Never, indeed, except in DANIEL, and that of necessity; as the Bible furnishes no more than two per∣sons, Daniel and Darius; and these were not sufficient to carry on the business of the Piece.</NOTE> of my own creation: Still less did I imagine myself at liberty to invent cir∣cumstances. I reflected, with awe, that <HI>the place whereon I stood was holy ground.</HI> All the latitude I permitted myself, was, to
<PB N="vi" REF="4"/>make such persons as I selected, act under such circumstances as I found, and express such sentiments as, in my humble judgment, appeared not unnatural to their situations.— Some of the speeches are so long as to retard the action; for I rather aspired after moral instruction, than the purity of Dramatic Com∣position. The very terms of Act and Scene are avoided, because I was unwilling to awaken the attention of the Reader to my deficiencies in critical exactness.</P>
<P>It may be thought that I have chosen, perhaps, the least important passage in the eventful Life of David, for the foundation of the Drama which bears his name. Yet even in this, his first exploit, the sacred Historian represents him as exhibiting no mean lesson of modesty, humility, courage,
<PB N="vii" REF="5"/>and piety: virtues not only admirable, but imitable; and within the reach of every Reader. Many will think that the intro∣duction of Saul's daughter would have add∣ed to the effect of the piece: and I have no doubt but that it would have made the intrigue more complicated and more inte∣resting, had this Drama been intended for the Stage. There, all that is tender, and all that is terrible in the passions, find a proper place. But I write for the Young, in whom it will be always time enough to have them awakened; I write for a class of Readers, to whom it is not easy to accom∣modate one's subject <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It would not be easy, I believe, to introduce Sacred Tragedies on the English Stage. The scrupulous would think it profane, while the profane would think it dull. Yet the excellent RACINE, in a dissipated country, and a voluptuous court, ventured to adapt the story of <HI>Athaliah</HI> to the French Theatre; and it remains to us a glorious monument of its Author's courageous piety, and of the perfection of the Dramatic Art.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="viii" REF="6"/>A very judicious and learned friend has remarked, that the <HI>Reflections of King Heze∣kiah</HI> breathe rather too much of the spirit of Christianity; for that it is scarcely probable he had so settled a belief in the general judgment. I feel the justness of the objec∣tion, without having been able to obviate it. I wished to convey a strong idea of this great leading truth, and have, perhaps im∣properly, ascribed sentiments to a Jewish monarch, merely because I wished to im∣press them on the Christian Reader.</P>
<P>The Critic and the Scholar, if any such should honour these pages with their atten∣tion
<PB N="ix" REF="7"/>will find ample matter on which to exercise their candor and their charity; qua∣lities so natural to genius and to learning, that even the feebleness of my performance will not be able to obstruct the exertion of them in favour of my intention.</P>
<P>The amiable Poet <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cowley.</NOTE> from whom I have taken my motto, after shewing the superi∣ority of the Sacred, over the Profane His∣tories (some instances of which I have no∣ticed in my Introduction), concludes with the following remark, which I may apply to myself with more propriety than it was used by the Author:— <Q>I am far from assuming to myself, to have fulfilled the duty of this weighty undertaking; and I shall be am∣bitious
<PB N="x" REF="8"/>of no other fruit from this weak and imperfect attempt of mine, but the opening of a way to the courage and in∣dustry of some other persons, who may be better able to perform it thoroughly and successfully.</Q></P>

<L>O For the sacred energy which struck</L>
<L>The harp of Jesse's son! or for a spark</L>
<L>Of that celestial flame which touch'd the lips</L>
<L>Of bless'd Isaiah <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isaiah, chap. vi.</NOTE>, when the Seraphim</L>
<L>With living fire descended, and his soul</L>
<L>From sin's pollution purg'd! or one faint ray,</L>
<L>(If human things to heavenly I may join)</L>
<L>Of that pure spirit which inflam'd the breast</L>
<L>Of Milton, God's own poet! when, retir'd,</L>
<L>In fair enthusiastic vision rapt,</L>
<L>The <HI>nightly visitant</HI> deign'd bless his couch</L>
<L>With inspiration, such as never flow'd</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="11"/>From Aganippe's fount, or Acidale:</L>
<L>Then, when the sacred fire within him burnt,</L>
<L>He spake, as man or angel might have spoke,</L>
<L>When man was pure, and Angels were his guests.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>It will not be.—Nor prophet's burning zeal;</L>
<L>Nor muse of fire, nor yet to sweep the strings</L>
<L>With sacred energy to me belongs;</L>
<L>Nor with Miltonic hand to touch the chords</L>
<L>That wake to ecstacy. From me, alas!</L>
<L>The secret source of harmony is hid;</L>
<L>The magic powers which catch the ravish'd soul</L>
<L>In melody's sweet maze, and the clear streams</L>
<L>Which to pure Fancy's yet untasted springs</L>
<L>Enchanted lead. Of these I nothing know;</L>
<L>Yet, all unknowing, dare invoke thy aid,</L>
<L>Spirit of Truth! who graciously hast said,</L>
<L>That none who ask in faith should ask in vain.</L>
</LG>

<L>You I invoke not now, ye fabled nine!</L>
<L>I not invoke you, though you well were sought</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="12"/>In Greece and Latium, by immortal bards,</L>
<L>Whose syren song enchants, and shall enchant,</L>

<L>And less than human were the gods they sung.</L>
<L>Tho' false their faith, they taught the best they knew,</L>
<L>And, blush O Christians! liv'd above their faith.</L>
<L>They wou'd have bless'd the beam, and hail'd the day,</L>

<L>Pure PLATO! how had thy chaste spirit hail'd</L>
<L>A faith so fitted to thy moral sense!</L>

<L>Nor had he met the vision at Philippi,</L>
<L>Nor had he sheath'd his bloody dagger's point,</L>
<L>Or in the breast he lov'd, or in his own.</L>

<L>The Pagan page how far more wise than ours!</L>
<L>They with the gods they worshipp'd grac'd their song;</L>
<L>Our song we grace with gods we disbelieve;</L>
<L>The manners we adopt without the creed.</L>
<L>Shall Fiction only raise poetic flame,</L>
<L>And shall no altars blaze, O TRUTH! to thee?</L>
<L>Shall falsehood only please, and fable charm?</L>
<L>And shall eternal Truth neglected lie?</L>
<L>Because immortal, slighted or profan'd?</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="14"/>Truth has our rev'rence only, not our love;</L>
<L>Our praise, but not our heart. A deity,</L>
<L>Confess'd, but shunn'd, acknowledg'd, not ador'd:</L>
<L>She comes too near us, and she shines too bright.</L>
<L>Her penetrating beam at once betrays</L>
<L>What we wou'd hide from others and ourselves.</L>

<L>How Pyrrha and the fam'd Thessalian <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Deucalion.</NOTE> king</L>
<L>Restor'd the ruin'd race of lost mankind;</L>
<L>Yet turn, incurious, from the patriarch sav'd,</L>
<L>The righteous remnant of a delug'd world?</L>
<L>Why are we taught, delighted, to recount</L>
<L>Alcides' labours, yet neglect to learn</L>
<L>How mighty Sampson led a life of toil</L>
<L>Herculean? Pain and peril mark'd them both;</L>
<L>A life eventful, and disastrous death.</L>
<L>Can all the tales which Grecian records yield;</L>

<L>Can each, can all, a lovelier picture yield</L>
<L>Of virtuous friendship; can they all present</L>
<L>A tenderness more touching than the love</L>
<L>Of Jonathan and David?—Speak, ye young!</L>
<L>You who are undebauch'd by fashion's lore,</L>
<L>And, unsophisticate, from nature judge,</L>
<L>Say, is your quick attention stronger drawn,</L>
<L>By wasted Thebes, than Pharaoh's smitten hosts?</L>
<L>Or do the vagrant Trojans yield a theme</L>
<L>More grateful to the eager appetite</L>
<L>Of young impatience, than the wand'ring tribes,</L>
<L>By Moses thro' the thirsty desert led?</L>
<L>The beauteous <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Iphigenia.</NOTE> Maid (tho' tender is the tale),</L>
<L>Whose guiltless blood on Aulis' altars stream'd,</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="17"/>Smites not the bosom with a softer pang</L>
<L>Than Jephthah's daughter, doom'd like her to die.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Such are the lovely themes which court the muse!</L>
<L>Scarce yet essay'd in verse. O let me mourn</L>
<L>That heav'n-descended song shou'd e'er forget</L>
<L>Its sacred dignity and high descent;</L>
<L>Shou'd e'er so far its origin debase,</L>
<L>To spread corruption's bane, to lull the bad</L>

<L>Of innocence, and silently infuse</L>
<L>Delicious poison, whose insidious charm</L>
<L>Feeds the sick mind, and fondly ministers</L>
<L>Unwholesome pleasure to the fever'd taste;</L>
<L>While its fell venom, with malignant pow'r,</L>
<L>Strikes at the root of virtue, with'ring all</L>

<SPEAKER>JESSE.</SPEAKER>
<L>Let not thy youth be dazzled, O my son!</L>
<L>With deeds of bold emprize, as valour only</L>

<L>The gay caparison, the burnish'd shield,</L>
<L>The plume-crown'd helmet, and the glitt'ring spear,</L>
<L>Scorn not the humble virtues of the shade;</L>
<L>Nor think that Heav'n views only with applause</L>
<L>The active merit, and the busy toil</L>
<L>Of heroes, statesmen, and the bustling sons</L>
<L>Of public care, These have their just reward</L>
<L>In wealth, in honours, and the well-earn'd fame</L>
<L>Their high atchievements bring. 'Tis in this sense</L>
<L>That virtue is her proper recompence.</L>
<L>Wealth, as its natural consequence, will flow</L>
<L>From industry; toil with success is crown'd:</L>
<L>From splendid actions high renown will spring.</L>
<L>Such is the usual course of human things.</L>
<L>For Wisdom Infinite permits that thus</L>
<L>Effects to causes be proportionate,</L>
<L>And nat'ral ends by nat'ral means atchiev'd.</L>
<L>But in the future estimate which Heav'n</L>
<L><PB N="61" REF="70"/>Will make of things terrestrial, know, my son,</L>
<L>That no inferior recompence belongs</L>
<L>To the mild <HI>passive</HI> virtues; meek Content,</L>
<L>Heroic self-denial, nobler far</L>
<L>Than all th'atchievements noisy Fame reports,</L>
<L>When her shrill trump proclaims the proud success</L>
<L>Which desolates the nations. But, on earth,</L>
<L>These are not always fortunate; because</L>
<L>Eternal Justice keeps them for the bliss</L>
<L>Of final recompence, for the dread day</L>
<L>Of gen'ral retribution. O my son!</L>
<L>The oftentatious virtues which still press</L>
<L>For notice, and for praise; the brilliant deeds</L>
<L>Which live but in the eye of observation,</L>
<L>These have their meed at once. But there's a joy</L>
<L>To the fond votaries of Fame unknown;</L>
<L>To hear the still small voice of conscience speak</L>
<L>Its whisp'ring plaudit to the silent soul.</L>
<L>Heav'n notes the sigh afflicted Goodness heaves;</L>
<L>Hears the low plaint by human ear unheard,</L>

<L>Him it was meant to raise. My eldest born,</L>
<L>Young Eliab, tall of stature, I presented;</L>
<L>But God, who judges not by outward form,</L>

<L>To chuse my eldest born. For Saul, he said,</L>
<L>Gave proof, that fair proportion, and the grace</L>
<L>Of limb or feature, ill repaid the want</L>
<L>Of virtue. All my other sons alike</L>
<L>By Samuel were rejected: till, at last,</L>
<L>On my young boy, on David's chosen head,</L>
<L>The prophet pour'd the consecrated oil.</L>
<L>Yet ne'er did pride elate him, ne'er did scorn</L>

<L>Who call romantic every finer thought,</L>
<L>Conceiv'd by pity, or by friendship wrought.</L>
<L><PB N="278" REF="284"/>Ah! wherefore happy? where's the kindred mind?</L>
<L>Where, the large soul that takes in human kind?</L>
<L>Where, the best passions of the mortal breast?</L>
<L>Where, the warm blessing when another's blest?</L>
<L>Where, the soft lenitives of others pain,</L>
<L>The social sympathy, the sense humane?</L>
<L>The sigh of rapture and the tear of joy,</L>
<L>Anguish that charms, and transports that destroy?</L>
<L>For tender Sorrow has her pleasures too,</L>
<L>Pleasures which prosp'rous Dulness never knew.</L>
<L>She never knew, in all her coarser bliss,</L>
<L>The sacred rapture of a pain like this!</L>
<L>Nor think the cautious only are the just;</L>
<L>Who never was deceiv'd I wou'd not trust.</L>
<L>Then take, ye happy vulgar! take your part</L>
<L>Of sordid joy which never touch'd the heart.</L>
<L>Benevolence, which seldom stays to chuse,</L>
<L>Lest pausing Prudence teach her to refuse;</L>
<L>Friendship, which once determin'd, never swerves,</L>

<L>And Mercy stretching out, ere Want can speak,</L>
<L>To wipe the tear from pale Affliction's cheek;</L>
<L>These ye have never known!—then take your part</L>
<L>Of sordid joy which never touch'd the heart.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ye who have melted in bright Glory's flame,</L>
<L>Or felt the spirit-stirring breath of fame!</L>
<L>Ye noble few! in whom her promis'd meed</L>
<L>Wakes the great thought, and makes the wish the deed!</L>
<L>Ye who have tasted the delight to give,</L>
<L>And, God's own agents, bid the wretched live;</L>
<L>Who the chill haunts of Desolation seek,</L>
<L>Raise the sunk heart, and flush the fading cheek!</L>
<L>Ye who with pensive Petrarch love to mourn,</L>
<L>Or weave fresh chaplets for Tibullus' urn;</L>
<L>Who cherish both in Hammond's plaintive lay,</L>
<L>The Provence myrtle, and the Roman bay!</L>
<L><PB N="280" REF="286"/>Ye who divide the joys, and share the pains</L>

<L>Wou'd you renounce such joys, such pains as these,</L>
<L>For vulgar pleasures, or for selfish ease?</L>
<L>Wou'd you, to 'scape the pain the joy forego,</L>
<L>And miss the transport to avoid the woe?</L>
<L>Wou'd you the sense of real sorrow lose,</L>

<L>No, Greville <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Beautiful Ode to Indifference.</NOTE>! no!—Thy song tho' steep'd in tears,</L>

<L>Yet wou'dst thou all thy well-sung anguish chuse,</L>
<L>And all th' inglorious peace thou begg'st, refuse.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Or you, BOSCAWEN! when you fondly melt,</L>
<L>In raptures none but mothers ever felt;</L>
<L>And view, enamour'd, in your beauteous race,</L>
<L>All LEVESON's sweetness, and all BEAUFORT's grace!</L>
<L>Yet think what dangers each lov'd child may share,</L>
<L>The youth if valiant, and the maid if fair;</L>
<L><PB N="281" REF="287"/>That perils multiply as blessings flow,</L>
<L>And constant sorrows on enjoyments grow:</L>
<L>You who have felt how fugitive is joy,</L>
<L>That while we clasp the phantom we destroy;</L>
<L>That life's bright sun is dimm'd by clouded views,</L>
<L>And who have most to love have most to lose;</L>
<L>Yet from these fair possessions wou'd you part,</L>
<L>To shield from future pain your guarded heart?</L>
<L>Wou'd your sond mind renounce its tender boast,</L>
<L>Or wish their op'ning bloom of promise lost?</L>
<L>Yield the dear hopes which break upon your view,</L>

<L>Debase the objects of your tend'rest pray'r.</L>
<L>To save the dangers of a distant care?</L>
<L>Consent, to shun the anxious fears you prove,</L>
<L>They less shou'd merit, or you less shou'd love?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet, while I hail the Sympathy Divine,</L>
<L>Which makes, O man! the wants of others thine:</L>
<L>I mourn heroic JUSTICE, scarcely own'd,</L>
<L>And PRINCIPLE for SENTIMENT dethron'd.</L>
<L><PB N="282" REF="288"/>While FEELING boasts her ever-tearful eye,</L>
<L>Stern TRUTH, firm FAITH, and manly VIRTUE fly.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Sweet SENSIBILITY! thou soothing pow'r,</L>
<L>Who shedd'st thy blessings on the natal hour,</L>
<L>Like fairy favours! Art can never seize,</L>
<L>Nor affectation catch thy pow'r to please:</L>
<L>Thy subtile essence still eludes the chains</L>
<L>Of Definition, and defeats her pains.</L>
<L>Sweet Sensibility! thou keen delight!</L>
<L>Thou hasty moral! sudden sense of right!</L>
<L>Thou untaught goodness! Virtue's precious seed!</L>
<L>Thou sweet precursor of the gen'rous deed!</L>
<L>Beauty's quick relish! Reason's radiant morn,</L>
<L>Which dawns soft light before Reflexion's born!</L>
<L>To those who know thee not, no words can paint,</L>
<L>And those who know thee, know all words are faint!</L>
<L>'Tis not to mourn because a sparrow dies;</L>
<L>To rave in artificial extasies:</L>
<L>'Tis not to melt in tender <HI>Otway's</HI> fires;</L>
<L>'Tis not to faint when injur'd <HI>Shore</HI> expires:</L>
<L><PB N="283" REF="289"/>'Tis not because the ready eye o'erflows</L>
<L>At <HI>Clementina's,</HI> or <HI>Clarissa's</HI> woes.</L>

<L>Forgive, O Richardson! nor think I mean,</L>
<L>With cold contempt, to blast thy peerless scene:</L>
<L>If some faint love of virtue glow in me,</L>
<L>Pure spirit! I first caught that flame from thee.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>While soft Compassion silently relieves,</L>
<L>Loquacious <HI>Feeling</HI> hints how much she gives;</L>
<L>Laments how oft her wounded heart has bled,</L>
<L>And boasts of many a tear she never shed.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As words are but th' external marks, to tell</L>
<L>The fair ideas in the mind that dwell;</L>
<L>And only are of things the outward sign,</L>
<L>And not the things themselves, they but define;</L>
<L>So exclamations, tender tones, fond tears,</L>
<L>And all the graceful drapery Pity wears;</L>
<L>These are not Pity's self, they but express</L>
<L>Her inward sufferings by their pictur'd dress;</L>
<L><PB N="284" REF="290"/>And these fair marks, reluctant I relate,</L>
<L>These lovely symbols may be counterfeit.</L>
<L>Celestial Pity! why must I deplore,</L>
<L>Thy sacred image stamp'd on basest ore?</L>
<L>There are, who fill with brilliant plaints the page,</L>
<L>If a poor linnet meet the gunner's rage:</L>
<L>There are, who for a dying sawn display</L>
<L>The tend'rest anguish in the sweetest lay;</L>
<L>Who for a wounded animal deplore,</L>
<L>As if friend, parent, country were no more;</L>
<L>Who boast quick rapture trembling in their eye,</L>
<L>If from the spider's snare they save a fly;</L>
<L>Whose well-sung sorrows every breast inflame,</L>
<L>And break all hearts but his from whom they came:</L>
<L>Yet, scorning life's <HI>dull</HI> duties to attend,</L>
<L>Will persecute a wife, or wrong a friend;</L>
<L>Alive to every woe by <HI>fiction</HI> dress'd;</L>
<L>The innocent he wrong'd, the wretch distress'd,</L>
<L>May plead in vain; their suff'rings come not near,</L>
<L>Or he relieves them cheaply with a tear.</L>
<L><PB N="285" REF="291"/>Not so the tender moralist of Tweed;</L>
<L>His <HI>Man of Feeling,</HI> is a man indeed.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oh, bless'd Compassion! Angel Charity!</L>
<L>More dear one genuine deed perform'd for thee,</L>
<L>Than all the periods Feeling e'er can turn,</L>
<L>Than all thy soothing pages, polish'd STERNE!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Not that by deeds alone this love's exprest,</L>
<L>If so, the affluent only were the blest.</L>
<L>One silent wish, one pray'r, one soothing word,</L>
<L>The precious page of Mercy shall record;</L>
<L>One soul-felt sigh by pow'rless Pity giv'n,</L>
<L>Accepted incense! shall ascend to Heav'n.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Since trifles make the sum of human things,</L>
<L>And half our mis'ry from our foibles springs;</L>
<L>Since life's best joys consist in peace and ease,</L>
<L>And few can save or serve, but all may please:</L>
<L>Oh! let th' ungentle spirit learn from hence,</L>
<L>A small unkindness is a great offence.</L>
<L><PB N="286" REF="292"/>Large bounties to bestow we wish in vain;</L>
<L>But all may shun the guilt of giving pain.</L>
<L>To bless mankind with tides of flowing wealth,</L>
<L>With pow'r to grace them, or to crown with health,</L>
<L>Our little lot denies; but Heav'n decrees</L>
<L>To all, the gift of minist'ring to ease.</L>
<L>The gentle offices of patient love,</L>
<L>Beyond all flatt'ry, and all price above;</L>
<L>The mild forbearance at another's fault,</L>
<L>The taunting word, suppress'd as soon as thought;</L>
<L>On these Heav'n bade the bliss of life depend,</L>
<L>And crush'd ill-fortune when he made a FRIEND.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A solitary blessing few can find,</L>
<L>Our joys with those we love are interwin'd;</L>
<L>And he, whose helpful tenderness removes</L>
<L>Th' obstructing thorn which wounds the breast he loves,</L>
<L>Smooths not another's rugged path alone,</L>
<L>But scatters roses to adorn his own.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="287" REF="293"/>
<L>The hint malevolent, the look oblique,</L>
<L>The obvious satire, or implied dislike;</L>
<L>The sneer equivocal, the harsh reply,</L>
<L>And all the cruel language of the eye;</L>
<L>The artful injury, whose venom'd dart,</L>
<L>Scarce wounds the hearing while it stabs the heart;</L>
<L>The guarded phrase whose meaning kills, yet told,</L>
<L>The list'ner wonders how you thought it cold;</L>
<L>Small slights, contempt, neglect unmix'd with hate,</L>
<L>Make up in number what they want in weight.</L>
<L>These, and a thousand griefs minute as these,</L>
<L>Corrode our comfort, and destroy our ease.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As this strong feeling tends to good or ill,</L>
<L>It gives fresh pow'r to vice or principle;</L>
<L>'Tis not peculiar to the wife and good;</L>
<L>'Tis passion's flame, the virtue of the blood.</L>
<L>But to divert it to its proper course,</L>
<L>There Wisdom's pow'r appears, there Reason's force;</L>
<L>If, ill-directed, it pursues the wrong,</L>
<L>It adds new strength to what before was strong;</L>
<L><PB N="288" REF="294"/>Breaks out in wild irregular desires,</L>
<L>Disorder'd passions, and illicit fires.</L>
<L>But if the virtuous bias rule the soul,</L>
<L>This lovely feeling then adorns the whole;</L>
<L>Sheds its sweet sunshine on the moral part,</L>
<L>Nor wastes on fancy what shou'd warm the heart,</L>
<L>Cold and inert the mental pow'rs wou'd lie,</L>
<L>Without this quick'ning spark of Deity.</L>
<L>To draw the rich materials from the mine,</L>
<L>To bid the mass of intellect refine;</L>
<L>To melt the sirm, to animate the cold,</L>
<L>And Heav'n's own impress stamp on nature's gold;</L>
<L>To give immortal MIND its sinest tone,</L>
<L>Oh, SENSIBILITY! is all thy own.</L>
<L>THIS is th' etherial flame which lights and warms,</L>
<L>In song transports us, and in action charms.</L>
<L>'Tis THIS that makes the pensive strains of GRAY <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is meant of the <HI>Elegy in a Country Church-yard,</HI> of which exquisite Poem, <HI>Sensibility</HI> is, perhaps, the cha∣racteristic beauty.</NOTE></L>

<L><PB N="289" REF="295"/>Makes the touch'd spirit glow with kindred fire,</L>
<L>When sweet SERENA's <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Triumphs of Temper.</NOTE> poet wakes the lyre.</L>
<L>'Tis THIS, tho' Nature's hidden treasures lie,</L>
<L>Bare to the keen inspection of her eye,</L>
<L>Makes PORTLAND's face its brightest rapture wear,</L>
<L>When her large bounty smooths the bed of care.</L>
<L>'Tis THIS that breathes thro' SEVIGNÈ's sweet page,</L>
<L>That nameless grace which soothes a second age.</L>
<L>'Tis THIS, whose charms the soul resistless seize,</L>
<L>And gives BOSCAWEN half her pow'r to please.</L>

<L>Why dread that energy of soul which leads</L>
