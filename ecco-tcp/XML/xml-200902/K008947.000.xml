<LG>
<L>BOLD is his task in this discerning age,</L>
<L>When every witling prates about the stage;</L>
<L>And some pert title arrogantly brings.</L>
<L>To trace up nature thro' her noblest springs:</L>
<L>Bold in such times, his task must be allow'd</L>
<L>Who seeks to form a judgment for the croud;</L>
<L>Presumes, the public sentiment to guide,</L>
<L>And speaks at once to prejudice and pride.</L>
<L>Of all the studies in these happier days,</L>
<L>By which we soar, ambitiously to praise.</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="3" MS="y"/>
Of all the fine performances of art,</L>
<L>Which charm the eye, or captivate the heart;</L>
<L>None like the stage our admiration draws;</L>
<L>Or gains so high, and proper<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> an applause.</L>
<L>Yet, has this art unhappily no rules</L>
<L>To check the vain impertinence of fools,</L>
<L>To point out rude deformity from grace,</L>
<L>And strike a line'twixt acting and grimace.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>HIGH as the town, with reverence we may name,</L>
<L>And stamp its general sentiments to fame;</L>
<L>Loud, as, perhaps, we eccho to its voice,</L>
<L>And pay a boundless homage to its choice;</L>
<L>Still, if we look, minutely, we shall find</L>
<L>Each single judge so impotent or blind,</L>
<L>That ev'n the actor whom we most admire,</L>
<L>For ease or humour, dignity or fire,</L>
<L>Shall often blush to meet the ill-earn'd bays,</L>
<L>And pine beneath an infamy of praise.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>How ost, soul-searching GARRICK, have I hung</L>
<L>On every accent of that wond'rous tongue;</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="4" MS="y"/>
When in Old LEAR, returning into sense,</L>
<L>And faintly guessing at some past offence,</L>
<L>To gain CORDELIA'S pardon thou hast pray'd,</L>
<L>And knelt by instinct with that suffering maid!</L>
<L>How has my breast then labour'd with its sigh,</L>
<L>And the big sorrow delug'd all my eye;</L>
<L>While keen delight perform'd a traytor's part,</L>
<L>And ach'd intensely round my struggling heart!</L>
<L>Yet, in those moments, when I sought to find</L>
<L>An equal transport in the public mind;</L>
<L>When I believ'd a sympathy wou'd shine</L>
<L>In every eye as honestly as mine;</L>
<L>A lifeless pause, perhaps, has gloom'd along,</L>
<L>And drowsy dulness sat upon the throng;</L>
<L>Enormous curls have slept on empty blocks,</L>
<L>Or well-bred curtsies shot from box to box;</L>
<L>Whereas, when prisoner, and in fetters bound,</L>
<L>A peal of praise has thunder'd all around,</L>
<L>And every hand employ'd its utmost pains,</L>
<L>To clap the mighty merit of the chains.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>WHEN things, like these, for ever give offence,</L>
<L>And empty shew is listed over sense:</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="5" MS="y"/>
When men throw nature negligently by,</L>
<L>And judge not from the feelings, but the eye;</L>
<L>Nay, when our actors, in their busiest parts,</L>
<L>While fear or hope stand beating at our hearts,</L>
<L>From the warm scene may scandalously run,</L>
<L>And feast the galleries with an instant pun;</L>
<L>Then, keen-ey'd satire, consciously shou'd rise,</L>
<L>And hold a mirror to the public eyes;</L>
<L>Alike regardless of her foe or friend,</L>
<L>With candour blame, with honesty commend;</L>
<L>Applaud, if right, the man she may detest,</L>
<L>And strike, if wrong, the brother of her breast.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'TIS on the stage, as 'tis in life, we find</L>
<L>No single man quite excellent in mind;</L>
<L>Nor do we meet a bosom so deprav'd,</L>
<L>So lost in vice, and utterly enslav'd,</L>
<L>But what, at times, some transient spark of grace</L>
<L>Has beam'd his eye, and flush'd upon his face;</L>
<L>With pitying warmth intuitively stole,</L>
<L>And pierc'd the Stygian sable of his soul.</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="6"/>
Therefore, unlike some brothers of the pen,</L>
<L>Who judg'd of actors as they judg'd of men,</L>
<L>In wild extremes ridiculously trod,</L>
<L>And drew, by turns, a daemon or a god;</L>
<L>My tints from life shall regularly glow,</L>
<L>And paint both faults and beauties as they grow;</L>
<L>Convinc'd, the truest pictures must be made,</L>
<L>Where light is blended properly with shade.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>LONG in the annals of theatric fame,</L>
<L>Has truth grac'd GARRICK with a foremost name;</L>
<L>Long in a wide diversity of parts,</L>
<L>Allow'd his double empire o'er our hearts;</L>
<L>Either in mirth to laugh us to excess,</L>
<L>Or, where he weeps, to load us with distress—</L>
<L>Nor is it strange, that e'en in partial days,</L>
<L>He gains so high an eminence of praise;</L>
<L>When his united requisites are more,</L>
<L>Than ever centred in one mind before:</L>
<L>Say, if we search, minutely, from the age</L>
<L>In which old THESPIS first began the stage,</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="7"/>
And range thro' all the celebrated climes,</L>
<L>In which it flourish'd, to the present times,</L>
<L>Where shall we find an actor who has prest,</L>
<L>With such extensive force upon the breast,</L>
<L>Fill'd such opposing characters for years,</L>
<L>Unmatch'd, alike, in laughter or in tears?</L>
<L>Others, perhaps, the greatest of their hour,</L>
<L>Whom fame extoll'd as prodigies of power,</L>
<L>Have yet to scanty limits been confin'd,</L>
<L>And shewn but one dull tendency of mind;</L>
<L>On bold blank-verse heroically rose,</L>
<L>Or meanly ambled upon humbler prose—</L>
<L>OTHELLO's form a B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>TTERTON might wear,</L>
<L>And rend the soul with horror and despair;</L>
<L>BOOTH might with conscious majesty declaim,</L>
<L>And build on CATO a substantial name;</L>
<L>In WILDAIR, WILKES most certainly might soar,</L>
<L>And CIBBER's sop set millions in a roar;</L>
<L>But which of these like GARRICK cou'd appear,</L>
<L>In ROMEO, SHARPE, in DRUGGER and in LEAR;</L>
<L>Fill the wide rounds of passion as they fall,</L>
<L>And shine with equal excellence in all?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><PB N="7" REF="8"/>
YET, tho' thus warm I freely pour my thoughts,</L>
<L>I still must think that GARRICK has his faults;</L>
<L>Some casual errors in his parts, which run</L>
<L>As specks sometimes will fasten on the sun;</L>
<L>Ev'n in his LEAR, where desperately wild,</L>
<L>He stabs the ruffians to preserve his child,</L>
<L>And quite worn out with tenderness and rage,</L>
<L>Leans, wholly spent, and breathless on the stage;</L>
<L>Then, while the tide of sympathy has rose,</L>
<L>And every bosom labour'd with his woes,</L>
<L>Then have I seen him negligently fall,</L>
<L>Full with his face against the prison wall,</L>
<L>Snatch every feature strangely from our sight,</L>
<L>And check the flood of exquisite delight.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THO' fam'd APELLES, at a touch cou'd give,</L>
<L>The warming canvass almost how to live;</L>
<L>Tho' scarce to less than deity, when grown,</L>
<L>He call'd out new creations of his own;</L>
<L>Yet, when the weakness of his art he saw,</L>
<L>The Grecian father's agony to draw,</L>
<L>'Twas wise, a veil upon his face to throw,</L>
<L>Whose pangs he found impossible to shew;</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="9"/>
But when, even Shakespear never cou'd possess</L>
<L>Too big a grief for GARRICK to express,</L>
<L>When his sharp eye so piercingly can roll,</L>
<L>And dart such instant passions thro' the soul,</L>
<L>Tis doubly wrong, the tenderer the case,</L>
<L>To hide the wond'rous workings of his face;</L>
<L>To check our hopes, or play upon our fears,</L>
<L>And damp the rich-soul'd luxury of tears.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>FOR five long years in dark oblivion thrown,</L>
<L>Has LEE remain'd, neglected and unknown,</L>
<L>Unless, when chance, on some capricious start,</L>
<L>Has kindly blest him with a decent part;</L>
<L>Yet was this LEE, at one auspicious hour,</L>
<L>Allow'd to boast a little share of power,</L>
<L>Was thought in various characters to please,</L>
<L>And fam'd no less for energy than ease,</L>
<L>For me, who feel a tenderness of breast,</L>
<L>Where'er a dawn of merit seems opprest,</L>
<L>I may, perhaps, be partial to his faults,</L>
<L>And do him more than justice in my thoughts;</L>
<L>But when I see the genuine passions rise,</L>
<L>Which flame in ABOAN's red resenting eyes;</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="10" MS="y"/>
When I behold in VERNISH's disgrace</L>
<L>The struggling soul so stampt upon the face;</L>
<L>Or meet in BELMONT with that dangerous art,</L>
<L>Which even for crimes can plead about the heart;</L>
<L>I own, it wounds my temper and my taste</L>
<L>To find him still so despicably plac'd;</L>
<L>Sent on in FRENCHMEN, RALEIGHS, and GLENDOWERS,</L>
<L>While things like PACKER surfeit us for hours.</L>
<L>'Tis true that LEE has fatally imbib'd</L>
<L>A mode of speech not easily describ'd;</L>
<L>A nice affected drawlingness of phrase,</L>
<L>A wire-drawn tone in every thing he plays;</L>
<L>With which, too oft, most execrably fine,</L>
<L>He racks a word, and tortures out a line;</L>
<L>Yet still has LEE a consequence of form,</L>
<L>A voice and look so capable to warm</L>
<L>A stage struck heat, so vehemently strong,</L>
<L>With such a piercing consciousness of wrong,</L>
<L>That even when BARRY, in his noblest course,</L>
<L>Some few weeks since exerted all his force;</L>
<L>Strain'd every nerve to draw the scattering crown;</L>
<L>And cramm'd his moon-ey'd idiot on the town;</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="11"/>
Then did this LEE burst on us in a blaze,</L>
<L>And wake us all to wonder and to praise;</L>
<L>Give vile IAGO'S deeply scheming ire</L>
<L>The boldest touches of dramatic fire,</L>
<L>And swell the gen'rous PIERRE with, a flame</L>
<L>That left even JAFFIER but a second fame.</L>
<L>Hence, mean soe'er, as managers may prize,</L>
<L>I look on LEE with very different eyes,</L>
<L>And freely place, however they disdain,</L>
<L>His chair next GARRICK'S high in Drury-Lane.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THE greatest charge our little judges lay</L>
<L>When HOLLAND'S worth they critically weigh,</L>
<L>Is, that in all the characters he tries,</L>
<L>His master GARRICK ever fills his eyes;</L>
<L>That meanly servile in his walk of parts,</L>
<L>He strives to shine by imitative arts,</L>
<L>And now, so dull a copiest is grown,</L>
<L>To want all sense and feeling of his own.</L>
<L>In this nice age, when fatally disgrac'd,</L>
<L>Poor sense falls martyr'd at the shrine of taste,</L>
<L>When a mere word, indefinite and vain,</L>
<L>The random coinage of the coxcomb's brain,</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="12"/>
By truth and judgment wholly unconsin'd,</L>
<L>And differing still in ev'ry different mind,</L>
<L>Usurps the air of sentiment, to pass</L>
<L>For sterling gold her despicable brass;</L>
<L>Then imitation certainly must fall,</L>
<L>And raise the general enmity of all;</L>
<L>Must own the pride-taught sentence to be just,</L>
<L>And lick the foot that tramples it in dust.</L>
<L>Yet, sure, if GARRICK hitherto has ran</L>
<L>By reason's line, and justly laid his plan</L>
<L>On that exalted principle of art,</L>
<L>Which knocks with truth's bold hand against the heart;</L>
<L>If in the various characters he plays</L>
<L>The genuine form of nature he conveys,</L>
<L>And hits, in short, upon that happy right,</L>
<L>Which gives the finest essence of delight,</L>
<L>Those who affect to turn away the head</L>
<L>When HOLLAND seeks his vestiges to tread,</L>
<L>Must argue less from judgment than from whim,</L>
<L>Since copying nature is to copy him,</L>
<L>But, why at all should critics proudly start,</L>
<L>And seem to frown, on imitative art?</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="13"/>
Where worth, or fame our admiration raise,</L>
<L>A wish to copy is a kind of praise—</L>
<L>Say in this age, some genius shou'd we find</L>
<L>So rich in thought, and vigorous in mind,</L>
<L>As gave the fury of a stage desire,</L>
<L>Even the pale glimm'ring of a SHAKESPEAR'S fire,</L>
<L>Should we not all inevitably throng</L>
<L>To hail the glowing wonders of his song,</L>
<L>And with a wild munificence reward</L>
<L>The faintest traces of our deathless bard?</L>
<L>For me, unapt to criticise In haste,</L>
<L>And little guilty of a modern taste;</L>
<L>I own this HOLLAND ever my offence,</L>
<L>But where he draws from GARRICK, and from sense;</L>
<L>While he does this, I patiently attend,</L>
<L>And often find no little to commend,</L>
<L>With honest warmth his plaudit I can hear,</L>
<L>And join myself the tribute of a tear.</L>
<L>But when some air-born fancy to pursue,</L>
<L>He lets his master once escape his view;</L>
<L>When much too great for imitation grown,</L>
<L>He boldly seeks a manner of his own,</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="14"/>
Sententious, dull, and heavy he appears,</L>
<L>His words like weights hang dragging on our cars;</L>
<L>Fatigues to death in spite of all our power,</L>
<L>And drawl the minute's sentence to an hour—</L>
<L>Nor is this all, a stupid sort of stare,</L>
<L>A starch'd, stiff, stalking, aukwardness of air,</L>
<L>Absorb at once his figure and his face,</L>
<L>And scorn all marks of nature and of grace;</L>
<L>While the purs'd lips, to wind up ev'ry pause,</L>
<L>Important swell and bully for applause.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>FEW for so short an interval have gain'd</L>
<L>A higher rank than POWELL has obtain'd;</L>
<L>And few, in fact, at present on the stage,</L>
<L>Deserve a warmer notice from the age.</L>
<L>Form'd with some lines that happily express</L>
<L>No little sense of pity and distress;</L>
<L>And form'd with tones that frequently impart</L>
<L>No little share of softness to the heart,</L>
<L>On many minds he tenderly can steal,</L>
<L>And teach a drowsy auditor to feel.</L>
<L><PB N="14" REF="15"/>
Hence, in those parts where wretchedness and years</L>
<L>Alarm alike our pity and our fears,</L>
<L>Where the poor LUSIGNAN, from prison led,</L>
<L>Shakes the white honours of his sacred head:</L>
<L>O'er his sweet Pagan tenderly complains,</L>
<L>And calls again for darkness, and for chains;</L>
<L>Or, where old HENRY, sick'ning with despair,</L>
<L>Upbraids the wildness of his madcap heir;</L>
<L>In parts like these, to POWELL I attend</L>
<L>A strong admirer, and a steady friend.—</L>
<L>But, when in gay LOTHARIO he wou'd shew,</L>
<L>The sprightly airs of libertine and beau;</L>
<L>Or give in TOWNLY, to a modish wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e,</L>
<L>The nicer touches of superior life;</L>
<L>Not all the scrapes, or cringes which he tries,</L>
<L>Those paltry arts of little men to rise;</L>
<L>The scorn of sense and judgment can remove,</L>
<L>Or teach one honest blockhead to approve.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As yet, two raw young striplings on the stage,</L>
<L>Unfit for fight, tho' burning to engage,</L>
<L><PB N="15" REF="16"/>
Led on by hope, courageously to press,</L>
<L>Yet taught by sense, to practise for success;</L>
<L>No judgment, now, of CAUTHERLY I frame;</L>
<L>Nor settle BENSLY'S title to a name.—</L>
<L>Where first essays are diffidently tried,</L>
<L>A candid mind must cautiously decide;</L>
<L>Nor rashly risque opinions, which in time</L>
<L>The muse herself may censure as a crime.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>WHERE the gay muse in laughter loves to sport,</L>
<L>And brisk THALIA holds her hum'rous court,</L>
<L>YATES with high rank, for ever must be plac'd,</L>
<L>Who blends such strict propriety with taste;</L>
<L>From nature's fount so regularly draws,</L>
<L>And never seeks to trick us of applause.</L>
<L>Mark, when he plays, no vacancy of face,</L>
<L>No wand'ring eye, or ignorant grimace,</L>
<L>Is rudely suffer'd once to intervene,</L>
<L>Or check the growing business of a scene;</L>
<L>Nay, in his silence, happily employ'd,</L>
<L>He looks continual meaning on the void;</L>
<L>Bids every glance with character be fraught,</L>
<L>And swells each muscle with a burst of thought.</L>
<L><PB N="16" REF="17"/>
Hence, in those cruder sections of a part,</L>
<L>Where want of humour must be fill'd by art,</L>
<L>Where the poor poet, in some luckless fit</L>
<L>Mistakes a dull prolixity for wit;</L>
<L>His merit shines with undiminish'd rays,</L>
<L>And lifts whole troops of RESTLESS'S to praise.—</L>
<L>Yet there are times, when spite of all his care,</L>
<L>Our taste must bristle, and our sense must stare:</L>
<L>When a new part unhappily he plays,</L>
<L>A thousand doubts perplex him, and amaze;</L>
<L>Fast from himself he tremblingly retires,</L>
<L>Nor trusts that worth which all the world admires;</L>
<L>But on a sea of causeless terror tost,</L>
<L>Allows both mind and memory to be lost.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But tho' on YATES the comic muse may shower</L>
<L>An ample fund of humour and of power;</L>
<L>Tho' in his walk of characters he claims</L>
<L>So high a place among theatric names,</L>
<L>Still there are others in her smiles who share,</L>
<L>And prove her generous as they know her fair.</L>
<L>Oft in some whim, the buxom nymph will try.</L>
<L>To pass for KING upon the public eye:</L>
<L><PB N="17" REF="18"/>
On TOM or RANGER, wantonly will seize,</L>
<L>And give us all his spirit and his ease:</L>
<L>Again, in PRATTLE physically prim,</L>
<L>She steals each look and attitude from him;</L>
<L>And like a virgin, whose unpractis'd breast</L>
<L>Some blooming youth entirely has possess'd;</L>
<L>Who, if mischance unhappily should start,</L>
<L>To wound the face that captivates her heart,</L>
<L>Feels no unkind propensity to rove,</L>
<L>But throbs all pitying with a soster love;</L>
<L>So, when emaciate with disease and years,</L>
<L>Her fav'rite KING in OGLEBY appears,</L>
<L>The comic muse exerts unusual force.</L>
<L>To call down laughter from its richest source;</L>
<L>Glows with a flame additionally warm,</L>
<L>And seems in more than raptures with his form—</L>
<L>O! that the goddess, in some lucky hour</L>
<L>Wou'd wisely try the utmost of her power,</L>
<L>Wou'd tell her KING, that in the well-bred smart,</L>
<L>Too great a pertness quite destroys the part;</L>
<L>And, when a BASSET'S habit he wou'd wear,</L>
<L>Dismiss the saucy SMATTER from his air.</L>

VERNON to favour ne'er can have pretence,</L>
<L>A singer truly, —and disgac'd with sense.</L>
<L>Why should a fellow blest with such a strain,</L>
<L>As still can charm us to the verge of pain,</L>
<L>The melting soul in extasy absorb,</L>
<L>And almost pluck a planet from its orb;</L>
<L>Why should he strive in such a sing-song age,</L>
<L>To soar by sterling merit on the stage,</L>
<L>Or seek by knowledge in dramatic laws,</L>
<L>To reach a vulgar MASCULINE applause?</L>
<L>Did he indeed, ne'er generously rise</L>
<L>Beyond the TOM<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>TALE, or the LONDON CRIES,</L>
<L>With which of late, so dead to every shame,</L>
<L>He meanly pimp'd for prostituted fame,</L>
<L>Some room for easy pardon might be found,</L>
<L>And dullness join most lovingly with sound;</L>
<L>But, when PHARNACES, or MACHEATH we see</L>
<L>So nerv'd with thought, so spirited and free,</L>
<L>When ev'n his flimsiest characters of song</L>

PALMER, from playing almost every night,</L>
<L>Has grown so long familiar to our sight,</L>
<L>That even in scenes scarce possible to bear,</L>
<L>We kindly rate him as a decent player.</L>
<L>Yet, since the stage its first existence drew,</L>
<L>An odder compound never struck our view;</L>
<L>Nor did the drama ever yet produce</L>
<L>So bad an actor half so fit for use.</L>
<L>Mark with what grace his person is design'd</L>
<L>For parts of life, and characters refin'd;</L>
<L>Yet, that strange shambling of deportment see,</L>
<L>Tho' easy, stiff; and manacled, tho' free;</L>
<L>Tho' strait, yet doubled; tortur'd, tho' in form;</L>
<L>Aukward, tho' bred; and spiritless tho' warm—</L>
<L>Tho' fraught with tones articulate and clear,</L>
<L>He keeps an endless screaming on the ear;</L>
<L>Howls out young OAKLEY in such hideous strains,</L>
<L>As midnight wolves might use upon the plains,</L>
<L>And strangles poor Sir BRILLIANT in a note</L>
<L>Too nicely horrid for a human throat.</L>
<L>But, tho' in wide and capital respects,</L>

Tho' that address so terrible must seem,</L>
<L>And that vile voice excruciate with its scream;</L>
<L>Yet, ever ready in the heaviest parts,</L>

<L>Reliev'd the tortur'd bosom thro' the eye,</L>
<L>And gave his sentence publicly the lye—</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>YET, high soever as the poet rates</L>
<L>The well-known worth and excellence of YATES,</L>
<L>He cannot give perfection to her share,</L>
<L>Nor say she's wholly faultless as a player—</L>
<L>Sometimes her sense too exquisitely strong,</L>
<L>By needless force will deviate into wrong;</L>
<L>And sometimes too, to throw this fault aside,</L>
<L>She blends too little tenderness with pride:</L>
<L>What need CALISTA, ent'ring on the stage,</L>
<L>Exclaim, "Be dumb for ever," in a rage?</L>
<L>Her faithful woman gives her woes relief,</L>
<L>And justice calls for temper, tho' for grief—</L>
<L>Again; when MODELY stands reveal'd to view,</L>
<L>And comes all suppliant to a last adieu,</L>
<L><PB N="41" REF="48" MS="y"/>
What need that cold indifference of air,</L>
<L>That stiff unbending haughtiness of stare?</L>
<L>'Tis true, the wretch deserves our utmost scorn—</L>
<L>Yet her resentment is but newly born;</L>
<L>And we shou'd read distinctly in her eyes,</L>
<L>That still she loves, howe'er she may despise—</L>
<L>Where women once a passion have profess'd,</L>
<L>They may resent; but never can detest;</L>
<L>Nor where the basest fav'rite they discard,</L>
<L>Conceal all marks of pity and regard—</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THUS has the poet on old DRURY tried</L>
<L>With care to judge, and candour to decide;</L>
<L>And shou'd the kind indulgence of the times</L>
<L>Approve thus far his motley string of rhimes,</L>
<L>His aim he yet more widely may pursue,</L>
<L>And BEARD'S light squadrons in their turn review—</L>
<L>Thro' all the pomp of coronations pierce,</L>
<L>And give their best manoeuvres in his verse—</L>
<L>Here, for the present then, he drops his plan,</L>
<L>Puts off the critic, and assumes the man,</L>
<L><PB N="42" REF="49" MS="y"/>Convinc'd, if truth shou'd only warm his muse,</L>
<L>The PUBLIC smile will still promote her views,</L>
<L>And conscious too, shou'd prejudice or pride</L>
<L>Appear alone her sentiments to guide,</L>
<L>The PUBLIC scorn her pen must cease to brand,</L>
<L>The sooner justice strikes it from her hand.</L>
