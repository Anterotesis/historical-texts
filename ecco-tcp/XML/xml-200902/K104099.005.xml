<L>WHILE orient skies restore the day,</L>

<L>Ye rural <HI>Thanes</HI> that o'er the mossy down</L>
<L>Some panting, timorous hare pursue;</L>
<L>Does nature mean your joys alone to crown?</L>
<L>Say, does she smoothe her lawns for you?</L>
<L>For you does Echo bid the rocks reply,</L>
<L>And urg'd by rude constraint resound the jovial cry?</L>

<L>The wretched swain your sport survey;</L>
<L>He finds his faithful fences torn,</L>
<L>He finds his labour'd crops a prey;</L>
<L>He sees his flock—no more in circles feed;</L>

<L>Nor yet, ye <HI>swains,</HI> conclude</L>

<L>Your bounded souls, and your conceptions crude,</L>

<L>The source of your delight profound,</L>

<L>The wealthy squire, whose gouty limbs are laid</L>

<L>HARK!—what a mournful solemn sound</L>

<L>That hold in glittering snares mankind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Tis Death's dread herald calls aloud,</L>
<L>Proclaims his conquest thro' the skies:</L>
<L>The sun retires behind a cloud,</L>
<L>And Nature seems to sympathize.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="88" REF="90"/>
<L>Reflect, ye restless sons of care!</L>
<L>Your vain designs his hand can spoil,</L>
<L>Make hard oppressors lend an ear,</L>
<L>And wretched misers cease their toil.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For what avail vast heaps of gold,</L>
<L>When Death his aweful writ shall send?</L>
<L>Tho' folly swell, and pride look bold,</L>
<L>The mask must drop, the farce must end.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>It is not hoary tottering age</L>
<L>That now lies stretch'd beneath his stroke;</L>
<L>The tyrant stern, that feels his rage:</L>
<L>Th' oppressor's rod, that now is broke.</L>

<L>But oh!—'tis generous Cynthio's bell!</L>

<L>And calls him to the silent tomb.</L>

<L>Cynthio!—whose happy healing art</L>
<L>Turn'd from his friends death's fatal blow,</L>
<L>And shielded from that threatening dart,</L>
<L>Which now, alas!—has laid him low.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But Cynthio's virtues ne'er can die,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>From heav'n descends the joyful strain,</L>

<L>HOW like you, Sir, the splendor of the day?</L>
<L>What! has your lordship not a word to say?</L>

<L>No powder'd liveries attend us here,</L>
<L>Hunger's our sauce, and mutton is our cheer.</L>
<L>Our worn-out customs may provoke your sport,</L>
<L>How long the graces, and the meals how short!</L>
<L>Nor can our mouldy college-life afford</L>

<L>Curtains of night and canopy of heaven:</L>

<L>Sleep with the lamb, as with the lark they rise.</L>
<L>Nay, prayers each day (strange things to modern beaux)</L>
<L>Open our morning, and our evening close:</L>

<HEAD>A LETTER to Sir ROBERT WALPOLE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By the late HENRY FIELDING, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR></BYLINE>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<LG>
<L>WHILE at the helm of state you ride,</L>
<L>Our nation's envy and its pride;</L>
<L>While foreign courts with wonder gaze,</L>
<L>And justly all your counsels praise,</L>
<L>Which, in contempt of faction's force,</L>
<L>Steer, tho' oppos'd, a steady course,</L>
<L>Wou'd you not wonder, Sir, to view</L>
<L>Your bard a greater man than you?</L>
<L>And yet the sequel proves it true.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>You know, Sir, certain ancient fellows</L>
<L>Philosophers, and others tell us,</L>
<L>That no alliance e'er between</L>
<L>Greatness and happiness is seen;</L>
<L>If so, may heaven still deny</L>
<L>To you, to be as great as I.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="118" REF="120"/>
<L>Besides, we 're taught, it does behove us,</L>
<L>To think those greater who 're above us:</L>
<L>Another instance of my glory,</L>
<L>Who live above you twice two story,</L>
<L>And from my garret can look down,</L>
<L>As from an hill, on half the town.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Greatness by poets still is painted,</L>
<L>With many followers acquainted:</L>
<L>This too does in my favour speak,</L>
<L>Your levée is but twice a week,</L>
<L>From mine I can exclude but one day;</L>
<L>My door is quiet on a Sunday.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The distance too at which they bow,</L>
<L>Does my superior greatness shew.</L>
<L>Familiar you to admiration,</L>
<L>May be approach'd by all the nation,</L>
<L>While I, like Great Mogul in Indo,</L>
<L>Am never seen but at a window.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The family that dines the latest,</L>
<L>Is in our street esteem'd the greatest,</L>
<L>But greater him we surely call,</L>
<L>Who hardly deigns to dine at all.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>If with my greatness you 're offended,</L>
<L>The fault is easily amended:</L>
<L>You have it, Sir, within your power</L>
<L>To take your humble servant lower.</L>

<HEAD>An EPISTLE from the Elector of BAVARIA to the FRENCH King, after the Battle of RAMILLIES.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>IF yet, great Sir, your heart can comfort know,</L>
<L>And the returning sighs less frequent flow;</L>
<L>If yet your ear can suffer ANNA'S fame,</L>
<L>And bear, without a start, her MARLBRO'S name;</L>
<L>If half the slain o'er wide <HI>Ramillia</HI> spread,</L>
<L>Are yet forgot, and in your fancy dead:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Attend, and be yourself, while I recite</L>
<L>(Oh! that I only can of losses write!)</L>
<L>To what a mighty sum our ills amount,</L>
<L>And give a faithful, tho' a sad account.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Let not <HI>Bavaria</HI> be condemn'd unheard,</L>
<L>Nor, 'till examin'd, have his conduct clear'd;</L>
<L>Charge not on me alone that fatal day,</L>
<L>Your own commanders bore too great a sway.</L>
<L>Think! Sir, with pity think! what I have lost,</L>
<L>My native realms and my paternal coast,</L>
<L>All that a firm confed'rate could bestow,</L>
<L>Ev'n faith and fame, if you believe the foe.</L>
<L>Think what a heavy load o'erwhelms my breast,</L>
<L>With its own sorrows and with yours opprest;</L>
<L><PB N="120" REF="122"/>After one battle lost, and country gone,</L>
<L>Vanquish'd again, alas! and twice undone.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oh! where shall I begin? what language find</L>
<L>To heal the raging anguish of your mind?</L>
<L>Or if you deign a willing ear to lend,</L>
<L>Oh! where will my disastrous story end?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Conquest I often promis'd, I confess,</L>
<L>And who from such a pow'r could promise less?</L>
<L>There <HI>Gallia</HI>'s force, and here <HI>Bavaria</HI>'s shines,</L>
<L>Th' experienc'd houshold fills our crowded lines;</L>
<L>Already had our tow'ring thoughts o'erthrown</L>
<L>The <HI>Belgian</HI> host, while we survey'd our own,</L>
<L>Destroy'd their provinces with sword and flame,</L>
<L>Let in their seas, and sack'd their <HI>Amsterdam;</HI></L>
<L>Already had we shar'd the fancy'd spoil,</L>
<L>(Imaginary trophies crown'd our toil)</L>
<L><HI>Batavian</HI> standards to this temple gave,</L>
<L>In that the <HI>British</HI> crosses doom'd to wave,</L>
<L>A rural seat assign'd each captive chief,</L>
<L>In flow'ry gardens to assuage his grief,</L>
<L>And by his arts, and first escape prepar'd,</L>
<L>On MARLBRO had bestow'd a double guard.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>Paris</HI> impatient for the conquer'd foe,</L>
<L>Hasten'd the tuneful hymn and solemn show;</L>
<L>Triumphal chariots for the victor stay'd,</L>
<L>And finish'd arches cast a pompous shade;</L>
<L>With nicest art the bards had dress'd their lays,</L>
<L>Of nothing fearful but to reach our praise;</L>
<L><PB N="121" REF="123"/>But all our hopes and expectation crost,</L>
<L>What lines have we? what fame has <HI>Boileau</HI> lost?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Your army now, fixt on its high designs,</L>
<L>Rush forth like vernal swarms, and quit their lines;</L>
<L>Eager the <HI>Dyle</HI> they pass to seek the fight,</L>
<L><HI>Judoina</HI>'s fields with sudden tents are white,</L>
<L>The foe descends, like torrents from the hills,</L>
<L>And all the neighb'ring vale tumultuous fills:</L>
<L>Preluding cannons tell th' approaching storm,</L>
<L>And working armies take a dreadful form.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Soon your victorious arms, and stronger force,</L>
<L>Tore all the left, and broke the <HI>Belgian</HI> horse;</L>
<L>Their scatter'd troops are rally'd to the fight,</L>
<L>But only rally'd for a second flight:</L>
<L>As when high heav'n on some aspiring wood,</L>
<L>Which in close ranks, and thickest order stood,</L>
<L>Pours its collected stores of vengeance down,</L>
<L>Cedars are seen with firs and oaks o'erthrown,</L>
<L>Long ravages and intervals of waste!</L>
<L>So gor'd their lines appear'd, and so defac'd.</L>
<L>The third attack had ended all the war,</L>
<L>Sunk their whole force, and sav'd your future care,</L>
<L>Had MARLBRO, only MARLBRO, not been there.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As some good genius flies, to save the realms</L>
<L>Which, in his absence born, a plague o'erwhelms,</L>
<L>Through op'ning squadrons did the hero haste,</L>
<L>And rais'd their drooping courage as he past.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="122" REF="124"/>
<L>Amidst the routed <HI>Belgians</HI> he arriv'd,</L>
<L>Turn'd the pursuit, the fainting fight reviv'd,</L>
<L>Supply'd each rank, fill'd ev'ry vacant space,</L>
<L>And brought the battle to its former face.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With trembling hearts we see our fate decreed;</L>
<L>Where MARLBRO fights how can a foe succeed?</L>
<L>To reach his life our boldest warriors strive,</L>
<L>On him the storm with all its thunder drive;</L>
<L>He stems the war, and half encompass'd round</L>
<L>Still clears his way, and still maintains his ground:</L>
<L>Amaz'd I saw him in such dangers live,</L>
<L>And envy'd him the death I wish'd to give.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But how our rising pleasure shall I tell?</L>
<L>The thund'ring steed, and the great rider, fell:</L>
<L>We thank'd kind heav'n, and hop'd the victor slain,</L>
<L>But all our hopes, and all our thanks were vain:</L>
<L>Free from the guilt of any hostile wound</L>
<L>Alive he lay, and dreadful on the ground.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As when a lion in the toils is cast,</L>
<L>That uncontroul'd had laid the country waste,</L>
<L>Th' insulting hinds surround him, who before</L>
<L>Fled from his haunts, and trembled at his roar;</L>
<L>So round beset the mighty <HI>Briton</HI> lies,</L>
<L>And vulgar foes attempt the glorious prize.</L>
<L>'Till fresh battalions to his succour brought,</L>
<L>Contending armies for the hero fought;</L>
<L>The wanted steed some friendly hand prepar'd,</L>
<L>And met a fatal, but a great, reward:</L>
<L><PB N="123" REF="125"/>A glorious death; of his lov'd lord bereft,</L>
<L>The pious office unperform'd he left.</L>
</LG>

<L>Our weaken'd <HI>houshold</HI> with new fury storm'd:</L>
<L>While all around to our admiring eyes</L>
<L>Fresh foes, and undiscover'd squadrons, rise.</L>
<L>The boasted guards that spread your name so far,</L>
<L>And turn'd where'er they fought the doubtful war,</L>
<L>With heaps of slaughter strow'd the fatal plain,</L>

<BYLINE>By the Honourable Sir C. H. WILLIAMS.</BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>APOLLO of old on Britannia did smile,</L>
<L>And Delphi forsook for the sake of this isle,</L>
<L>Around him he lavishly scatter'd his lays,</L>
<L>And in every wilderness planted his bays;</L>
<L>Then Chaucer and Spenser harmonious were heard,</L>
<L>Then Shakespear, and Milton, and Waller appear'd,</L>
<L>And Dryden, whose brows by Apollo were crown'd,</L>
<L>As he sung in such strains as the God might have own'd:</L>
<L>But now, since the laurel is given of late</L>
<L>To Cibber, to Eusden, to Shadwell and Tate,</L>
<L>Apollo hath quitted the isle he once lov'd,</L>
<L>And his harp and his bays to Hibernia remov'd;</L>
<L>He vows and he swears he'll inspire us no more,</L>
<L>And has put out Pope's fires which he kindled before;</L>
<L>And further he says, <HI>men</HI> no longer shall boast</L>
<L>A science their slight and ill treatment hath lost;</L>

<HEAD>The BEE, the ANT, and the SPARROW: A FABLE. Address'd to PHEBE and KITTY C. at Boarding School.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>MY dears, 'tis said in days of old,</L>
<L>That beasts cou'd talk, and birds could scold.</L>
<L>But now it seems the human race</L>
<L>Alone engross the speaker's place.</L>
<L>Yet lately, if report be true,</L>
<L>(And much the tale relates to you)</L>
<L>There met a Sparrow, Ant, and Bee,</L>
<L>Which reason'd and convers'd as we.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Who reads my page will doubtless grant</L>
<L>That Phe's the wise industrious Ant.</L>
<L>And all with half an eye may see</L>
<L>That Kitty is the busy Bee.</L>
<L>Here then are two—but where's the third?</L>
<L>Go search your school, you'll find the Bird.</L>
<L>Your school! I ask your pardon fair,</L>
<L>I'm sure you'll find no Sparrow there.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now to my tale—One summer's morn</L>
<L>A Bee rang'd o'er the verdant lawn;</L>
<L><PB N="170" REF="172"/>Studious to husband every hour,</L>
<L>And make the most of every flow'r.</L>
<L>Nimble from stalk to stalk she flies,</L>
<L>And loads with yellow wax her thighs;</L>
<L>With which the artist builds her comb,</L>
<L>And keeps all tight and warm at home:</L>
<L>Or from the cowslip's golden bells</L>
<L>Sucks honey to enrich her cells:</L>
<L>Or every tempting rose pursues,</L>
<L>Or sips the lilly's fragrant dews;</L>
<L>Yet never robs the shining bloom,</L>
<L>Or of its beauty or perfume.</L>
<L>Thus she discharg'd in every way</L>
<L>The various duties of the day.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>It chanc'd a frugal Ant was near,</L>
<L>Whose brow was wrinkled o'er by care:</L>
<L>A great oeconomist was she,</L>
<L>Nor less laborious than the Bee;</L>
<L>By pensive parents often taught</L>
<L>What ills arise from want of thought;</L>
<L>That poverty on sloth depends,</L>
<L>On poverty the loss of friends.</L>
<L>Hence every day the Ant is found</L>
<L>With anxious steps to tread the ground;</L>
<L>With curious search to trace the grain,</L>
<L>And drag the heavy load with pain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The active Bee with pleasure saw</L>
<L>The Ant fulfil her parents' law.</L>
<L><PB N="171" REF="173"/>Ah! sister-labourer, says she,</L>
<L>How very fortunate are we!</L>
<L>Who taught in infancy to know</L>
<L>The comforts, which from labour flow,</L>
<L>Are independent of the great,</L>
<L>Nor know the wants of pride and state.</L>
<L>Why is our food so very sweet?</L>
<L>Because we earn, before we eat.</L>
<L>Why are our wants so very few?</L>
<L>Because we nature's calls pursue.</L>
<L>Whence our complacency of mind?</L>
<L>Because we act our parts assign'd.</L>
<L>Have we incessant tasks to do?</L>
<L>Is not all nature busy too!</L>
<L>Doth not the sun with constant pace</L>
<L>Persist to run his annual race?</L>
<L>Do not the stars, which shine so bright,</L>
<L>Renew their courses every night?</L>
<L>Doth not the ox obedient bow</L>
<L>His patient neck, and draw the plough?</L>
<L>Or when did e'er the generous steed</L>
<L>Withhold his labour or his speed?</L>
<L>If you all nature's system scan,</L>
<L>The only idle thing is man!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A wanton Sparrow long'd to hear</L>
<L>Their sage discourse, and strait drew near.</L>
<L>The bird was talkative and loud,</L>
<L>And very pert and very proud;</L>
<L><PB N="172" REF="174"/>As worthless and as vain a thing,</L>
<L>Perhaps as ever wore a wing.</L>
<L>She found, as on a spray she sat,</L>
<L>The little friends were deep in chat;</L>
<L>That virtue was their favourite theme,</L>
<L>And toil and probity their scheme:</L>
<L>Such talk was hateful to her breast,</L>
<L>She thought them arrant prudes at best.</L>
<L>When to display her naughty mind,</L>
<L>Hunger with cruelty combin'd;</L>
<L>She view'd the Ant with savage eyes,</L>
<L>And hopt and hopt to snatch her prize.</L>
<L>The Bee, who watch'd her opening bill,</L>
<L>And guess'd her fell design to kill;</L>
<L>Ask'd her from what her anger rose,</L>
<L>And why me treated Ants as foes?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Sparrow her reply began,</L>
<L>And thus the conversation ran.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Whenever I'm dispos'd to dine,</L>
<L>I think the whole creation mine;</L>
<L>That I'm a bird of high degree,</L>
<L>And every insect made for me.</L>
<L>Hence oft I search the emmet brood,</L>
<L>For emmets are delicious food:</L>
<L>And oft in wantonness and play,</L>
<L>I slay ten thousand in a day.</L>
<L>For truth it is, without disguise,</L>
<L>That I love mischief as my eyes.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="173" REF="175"/>
<L>Oh! fie, the honest Bee reply'd,</L>
<L>I fear you make base man your guide;</L>
<L>Of every creature sure the worst,</L>
<L>Tho' in creation's scale the first!</L>
<L>Ungrateful man! 'tis strange he thrives,</L>
<L>Who burns the Bees, to rob their hives!</L>
<L>I hate his vile administration,</L>
<L>And so do all the emmet nation.</L>
<L>What fatal foes to birds are men</L>
<L>Quite to the Eagle from the Wren!</L>
<L>Oh! do not men's example take,</L>
<L>Who mischief do for mischief's sake;</L>
<L>But spare the Ant—her worth demands</L>
<L>Esteem and friendship at your hands.</L>
<L>A mind with every virtue blest,</L>
<L>Must raise compassion in your breast.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Virtue! rejoin'd the sneering bird,</L>
<L>Where did you learn that gothic word?</L>
<L>Since I was hatch'd, I never heard,</L>
<L>That virtue was at all rever'd.</L>
<L>But say it was the ancients' claim,</L>
<L>Yet moderns disavow the name;</L>
<L>Unless, my dear, you read romances,</L>
<L>I cannot reconcile your fancies.</L>
<L>Virtue in fairy tales is seen</L>
<L>To play the goddess or the queen;</L>
<L>But what's a queen without the pow'r,</L>
<L>Or beauty, child, without a dow'r?</L>
<L><PB N="174" REF="176"/>Yet this is all that virtue brags,</L>
<L>At best 'tis only worth in rags.</L>
<L>Such whims my very heart derides,</L>
<L>Indeed you make me burst my sides.</L>
<L>Trust me Miss Bee—to speak the truth,</L>
<L>I've copyed men from earliest youth;</L>
<L>The same our taste, the same our school,</L>
<L>Passion and appetite our rule.</L>
<L>And call me bird, or call me sinner,</L>
<L>I'll ne'er forego my sport or dinner.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A prowling cat the miscreant spies,</L>
<L>And wide expands her amber eyes:</L>
<L>Near and more near Grimalkin draws,</L>
<L>She wags her tail, protends her paws;</L>
<L>Then springing on her thoughtless prey,</L>
<L>She bore the vicious bird away.</L>

<HEAD>ODE on a STORM.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>WITH gallant pomp, and beauteous pride</L>
<L>The floating pile in harbour rode,</L>

<L>Pretended friendship waits on pow'r,</L>

<L>When adverse Fortune shifts the sail,</L>
<L>And hastens to devour.</L>

<L>In vain we fly approaching ill,</L>
<L>Danger can multiply its form;</L>
<L>Expos'd we fly like Jonas still,</L>
<L>And heaven, when 'tis heaven's will,</L>
<L>O'ertakes us in a storm.</L>

<LG>
<L>The distant surges foamy white</L>

<L>A fatal harvest on the deck,</L>
<L>Quick in pursuit as active flame,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus, Adam smil'd with new-born grace,</L>
<L>Life's flame inspir'd by heav'nly breath;</L>
<L>Thus the same breath sweeps off his race,</L>
<L>Disorders Nature's beauteous face,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>Stripp'd of her pride the vessel rolls,</L>

<L>The secret anguish of our souls,</L>
<L>With inward deeper groans condoles</L>
<L>The danger of her crew.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now what avails it to be brave,</L>
<L>On liquid precipices hung?</L>
<L>Suspended on a breaking wave,</L>

<LG>
<L>The faithless flood forsook her keel,</L>

<L>KIND heav'n at length, successfully implor'd,</L>
<L>To Britain's arms her hero had restor'd:</L>
<L>And now our fears remov'd, with loud applause</L>
<L>Jointly we crown'd his conduct, and his cause.</L>
<L>Transporting pleasure rais'd each drooping tongue,</L>
<L>The peasants shouted, and the poets sung.</L>
<L>The poets sung, tho' Addison alone</L>
<L>Adorns thy laurels, and maintains his own;</L>
<L>In him alone, great MARLBOROUGH, is seen,</L>
<L>Thy graceful motion, and thy godlike mien:</L>
<L><PB N="189" REF="191"/>Each action he exalts with rage divine,</L>
<L>And the full Danube flows in ev'ry line.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But we in vain to that sublime aspire;</L>
<L>So heatless glow-worms emulate the fire,</L>
<L>Shine without warmth: another song prepare,</L>
<L>My Muse; the country is the Muse's care;</L>
<L>Thither thy much-lov'd MARLBOROUGH pursue</L>
<L>With eager verse, and keep thy theme in view.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But oh! what joyful numbers can disclose</L>
<L>The various raptures his approach bestows;</L>
<L>How vales resound, how crowds collected share</L>
<L>The radiant glories of the matchless pair?</L>
<L>The gen'rous youths, within whose bosoms glow</L>
<L>Some secret unripe longings for a foe,</L>
<L>Surveying here the favourite of Fame,</L>
<L>Conceive new hopes, and nurse the growing flame:</L>
<L>While softer maids confess a pleasing pain,</L>
<L>And sighing wish he had been born a swain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So when the pow'rs appeas'd bade discord cease,</L>
<L>And Greece obtain'd from jarring gods a peace,</L>
<L>The god of war, and beauteous queen of love,</L>
<L>To Cyprian shades their peaceful chariot drove:</L>
<L>Shepherds and nymphs attending form'd the train,</L>
<L>And mirth unusual revell'd on the plain.</L>
<L>And should the gods once more their heav'n forego,</L>
<L>To range on earth, and bless mankind below,</L>
<L>O'er all the globe no region would be found,</L>
<L>With nobler soil, or brighter beauty crown'd.</L>
<L><PB N="190" REF="192"/>Phoebus for this would change his Delphic grove,</L>
<L>Juno her Samos, and his Ida Jove.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Olympic games no longer should delight,</L>
<L>But neighb'ring plains afford a nobler sight.</L>
<L>Where England's great Aeneas standing by,</L>
<L>Impatient youths on winged coursers fly:</L>
<L>Urg'd by his presence they outstrip the wind</L>
<L>Involv'd in smoke, and leave the Muse behind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But see! once more returns the rival train,</L>
<L>And now they stretch, now bending loose the rein,</L>
<L>And fears and hopes beat high in ev'ry vein,</L>
<L>'Till one (long since successful in the field)</L>
<L>Exerts that strength he first with art conceal'd;</L>
<L>Then swift as light'ning darted through the skies,</L>
<L>Springs forward to the goal, and bears away the prize.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>By arts like these all other palms are won,</L>
<L>They end with glory, who with caution run.</L>
<L>We neither write, nor act, what long can last,</L>
<L>When the first heat sees all our vigour past;</L>
<L>But, jaded, both their short-liv'd mettle lose,</L>
<L>The furious statesman, and the fiery Muse.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The contest ended, night with gloomy face</L>
<L>O'erspreads the heav'n; and now with equal pace</L>
<L>The victor, and the vanquish'd, quit the place:</L>
<L>Sleep's friendly office is to all the same,</L>
<L>His conquest he forgets, and they their shame.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Next morning, ere the sun with sickly ray</L>
<L>O'er doubtful shades maintains the dawning day,</L>
<L><PB N="191" REF="193"/>The sprightly horn proclaims some danger near,</L>
<L>And hounds, harmonious to the sportsman's ear,</L>
<L>With deep-mouth'd notes rouse up the trembling deer.</L>
<L>Startled he leaps aside, and list'ning round,</L>
<L>This way and that explores the hostile sound,</L>
<L>Arm'd for that fight, which he declines with shame,</L>
<L>Too fond of life, too negligent of fame;</L>
<L>For Nature, to display her various art,</L>
<L>Had fortify'd his head, but not his heart:</L>
<L>Those spears, which useless on his front appear'd,</L>
<L>On any else had been ador'd and fear'd.</L>
<L>But honours disproportion'd are a load,</L>
<L>Grandeur a specious curse, when ill bestow'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus void of hope, and panting with surprize,</L>
<L>In vain he'd combat, and as vainly flies.</L>
<L>Of paths mysterious whether to pursue</L>
<L>The scented track informs the lab'ring crew:</L>
<L>With speed redoubled, they the hint embrace,</L>
<L>Whilst animating music warms the chace:</L>
<L>Flush'd are their hopes, and with one gen'ral cry</L>
<L>They echo thro' the woods, and sound their conquest nigh.</L>
<L>Not so the prey; he now for safety bends</L>
<L>From enemies profess'd, to faithless friends,</L>
<L>Who to the wretched own no shelter due,</L>
<L>But fly more swiftly than his foes pursue.</L>
<L>This last disgrace with indignation fires</L>
<L>His drooping soul, and gen'rous rage inspires;</L>
<L><PB N="192" REF="194"/>By all forsaken, he resolves at length</L>
<L>To try the poor remains of wasted strength;</L>
<L>With looks and mien majestic stands at bay,</L>
<L>And whets his horns for the approaching fray:</L>
<L>Too late alas! for, the first charge begun,</L>
<L>Soon he repents what cowardice had done,</L>
<L>Owns the mistake of his o'er-hasty flight,</L>
<L>And aukwardly maintains a languid fight;</L>
<L>Here, and there, aiming a successless blow,</L>
<L>And only seems to nod upon the foe.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So coward princes, who at war's alarm</L>
<L>Start from their greatness, and themselves disarm,</L>
<L>With recollected forces strive in vain</L>
<L>Their empire, or their honour, to regain,</L>
<L>And turn to rally on some distant plain,</L>
<L>Whilst the fierce conqu'ror bravely urges on,</L>
<L>Improves th' advantage, and ascends the throne.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Forgive, great Denham, that in abject verse,</L>
<L>What richly thou adorn'st, I thus rehearse.</L>
<L>Thy noble chace all others does exceed,</L>
<L>In artful fury, and well-temper'd speed.</L>
<L>We read with pleasure, imitate with pain,</L>
<L>Where faney fires, and judgment holds the rein.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Goddess, proceed; and as to relicks found</L>
<L>Altars we raise, and consecrate the ground,</L>
<L>Pay thou thy homage to an aged seat,</L>
<L>Small in itself, but in its owner great;</L>

<L>Cadence, and sound, which we so prize, and use,</L>

<L>Inflam'd great Henry, and incens'd his queen,</L>
<L>With pleasing sorrow move me to survey</L>
<L>A neighb'ring structure, aweful in decay,</L>

<L>Which heretofore contain'd that lovely guest.</L>
<L><PB N="194" REF="196"/>Admiring strangers, who attentive come</L>
<L>To learn the tale of this romantic dome,</L>
<L>By faithful monuments instructed, view</L>
<L>(Tho' time should spare) what civil rage can do.</L>
<L>Where landskips once, in rich apartments high,</L>
<L>Through various prospects led the wand'ring eye:</L>
<L>Where painted rivers flow'd through flow'ry meads,</L>
<L>And hoary mountains rear'd their aweful heads:</L>
<L>Or where by hands of curious virgins wrought,</L>
<L>In rich array embroider'd heroes fought:</L>
<L>Now hemloek thrives, and weeds of pow'rful charms</L>
<L>O'er ragged walls extend their baleful arms.</L>
<L>Monsters obscene their pois'nous roots invade,</L>
<L>And bloated pant beneath the gloomy shade.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus noblest buildings are with ease effac'd,</L>
<L>And what's well wrote alone, will always last.</L>
</LG>

<L>Ev'n Vanbrugh's frame, that does so brightly shine</L>
<L>In rules exact, and greatness of design,</L>
<L>Would fall a victim to devouring age,</L>
<L>Had not that hand, which built, adorn'd the stage.</L>
<L>Wit so refin'd without the poet's pain,</L>
<L>Such artful scenes in such a flowing vein,</L>
<L>O'er latest aeras deathless will prevail,</L>

<L>Lo! at her feet the scepter'd vassal lies,</L>
<L>Now big with hopes, now tortur'd with despair,</L>

<L>Farewel, vain world!—Yet, ere I die, I'll find</L>

<HEAD>A TALE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By Mr. MERRICK.</BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>IF Virtue prompt thy willing mind</L>
<L>To actions gen'rous, good and kind;</L>
<L>Fortune beyond thy hopes shall bless</L>
<L>Thy toils, and crown them with success:</L>
<L>But he whose bounties only rise</L>
<L>From prospects of a future prize,</L>
<L>With sorrow shall compute his gains,</L>
<L>And reap repentance for his pains.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Precepts are often found to fail,</L>
<L>So take instruction from my tale.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In ancient days there liv'd a priest,</L>
<L>Inshrin'd within whose pious breast</L>
<L>Fair Virtue shone; his open look</L>
<L>Gave sanction to each word he spoke.</L>
<L>Fix'd to no home, in mean array,</L>
<L>From place to place he took his way,</L>
<L>Instructing as he went along,</L>
<L>And dealing blessings to the throng.</L>
<L>The truth he labour'd to express,</L>
<L>In language plain as was his dress;</L>
<L>Yet all with secret rapture hung</L>
<L>On every accent of his tongue:</L>
<L><PB N="214" REF="216"/>A silent eloquence there ran</L>
<L>Through all the actions of the man;</L>
<L>They mark'd his soul's unblemish'd frame,</L>
<L>His precept and his life the same.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>It chanc'd, as musing once he stray'd,</L>
<L>Around him night's descending shade</L>
<L>Unheeded stole; through paths unknown</L>
<L>With darkling steps he wander'd on,</L>
<L>And wish'd to shroud his weary head</L>
<L>Beneath some hospitable shed.</L>
<L>When through the gloom a sudden ray</L>
<L>Sprung forth, and shot across the way,</L>
<L>Led by the light, a cott he found:</L>
<L>A pious dame the mansion own'd,</L>
<L>Whose open heart, tho' small her store,</L>
<L>Ne'er turn'd the stranger from her door.</L>
<L>Think at the sight of such a guest,</L>
<L>What transport rose within her breast:</L>
<L>With joy the friendly board she spread,</L>
<L>And plac'd him in her warmest bed.</L>
<L>Deep sunk in sleep the trav'ler lay,</L>
<L>Tir'd with the labours of the day.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Tis best, as ablest critics deem,</L>
<L>To suit your language to your theme;</L>
<L>Obsequious to their rules, the Muse</L>
<L>In humbler strain her tale pursues.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The matron, while her thankful guest</L>
<L>Had shar'd with her the slender feast,</L>
<L><PB N="215" REF="217"/>With curious eye had view'd him o'er,</L>
<L>Had mark'd the tatter'd garb he wore,</L>
<L>And through the yawning frieze had seen</L>
<L>No traces of a shirt within.</L>
<L>And now her hands with pious care</L>
<L>A shirt of home-spun cloth prepare:</L>
<L>'Twas coarse, but would the longer hold,</L>
<L>And serve to fence him from the cold.</L>
<L>The toil employ'd her all the night,</L>
<L>And ended with the rising light.</L>
<L>The priest arose at break of day,</L>
<L>And hasten'd to pursue his way;</L>
<L>With thanks he took the finish'd vest,</L>
<L>The hospitable dame he bless'd,</L>
<L>"And that thy charity, he said,</L>
<L>"May fall with int'rest on thy head,</L>
<L>"May thy first work, when I am gone,</L>
<L>"Continue 'till the setting sun."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>She heard; but soon her houshold care</L>
<L>Had banish'd from her thoughts the pray'r;</L>
<L>The remnant of her cloth she took,</L>
<L>And measur'd out her little stock.</L>
<L>Beneath her hands the length'ning piece</L>
<L>Surpriz'd her with a vast increase;</L>
<L>Astonish'd at a sight so new,</L>
<L>She measur'd still and still it grew.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As when in sleep, with winged pace</L>
<L>O'er hills and plains we urge the race,</L>
<L><PB N="216" REF="218"/>With eager hopes we onward bend,</L>

<L>His thefts obstruct, nor massy bars avail,</L>
<L>Nor doors robust, to save the luscious cates:</L>
<L>Through walls, and bars, and doors he eats his way</L>
<L>Contemptuous, and regales with unbought fare.</L>

<L>Thus wail'd the helpless world the general foe,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Nation saw,</L>

<L>What shou'd they do? They foam, they gnash their teeth,</L>
<L>And o'er their pendant rocks in fury rove,</L>
<L>Restless with rage—for Nature prone to rage</L>

<L>Their souls were with their fingers sulphur-ting'd.</L>

<LG>
<L>It is decreed—Rage prompts them to revenge</L>
<L>Unsated but with blood—Yet by what means,</L>

<L>They doubt: for, Cambria, thy Grimalkin race</L>
<L>Nor to the house defence, nor in distress</L>

<L>Oft had the Cat plac'd at the cavern's mouth</L>

<L>Soft-silent creeping, near the hollow cell</L>
<L>Kept wary watch—In vain—The little Mouse</L>
<L>In little bulk secure, (advantage great</L>

<L>Her watching at his door intent on prey,</L>
<L>Inward he flies, his serpentine recess</L>
<L>Pursues, and caves impervious to Cat:</L>
<L>Nor dares again thrust out his head in air,</L>
<L>Nor form new sallies, till the siege be rais'd,</L>
<L>And danger with the watchful foe withdrawn.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Cambrians thus, (if Cambrians with the Mouse</L>

<L>Eluded his vain toil.—To their retreat</L>

<L>With hooked talons grasps his bonds, and hangs</L>
<L>Tenacious by his feet—At length he drops</L>
<L>Out-shaken: instant to her prey the Cat</L>
<L><PB N="268" REF="270"/>Flies rapid, and With rude, embrace enfolds,</L>
<L>And savage kisses on her struggling foe</L>

<L>Denotes the Victor's joy; her body moves</L>
<L>Agil in wanton frolicks, watching now</L>
<L>Prone on the earth intent the destin'd Mouse;</L>
<L>His neck now lightly pats with hurtless paw,</L>
<L>Dissembling love; but ruminates the while</L>
<L>To tear him limb from limb. The Mouser thus,</L>
<L>Witty in tyranny, with various art</L>
<L>Wanton barbarity enjoys: but now,</L>
<L>Tir'd with the sportive mockery, no more</L>
<L>Conceals her rage, but o'er her trembling prey</L>
<L>Like the starv'd lion hangs, and growling tears</L>
<L>His gory entrails, and convulsive limbs.</L>
</LG>

<L>Thy gift the Cambrian celebrates; and Thee</L>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE to COMUS, Perform'd for the Benefit of the General Hospital at BATH, 1756.</HEAD>

<LG>
<L>WELL, I've been beating up for volunteers,</L>
<L>But find that—charity has got no ears.</L>
<L>I first attack'd a colonel of the guards—</L>
<L>Sir, charity—consider its rewards.</L>
<L>With healing hand the saddest sores it skins,</L>
<L>And covers—oh!—a multitude of sins.</L>
<L>He swore, the world was welcome to his thoughts:</L>
<L>'Twas damn'd <HI>hypocrisy</HI> to hide one's faults;</L>
<L>And with that sin his conscience ne'er was <HI>twitted</HI>—</L>
<L>The only <HI>one</HI> he never had committed.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Next, to my knight I plead. He—shook his head;</L>
<L>Complain'd the stocks were low—and trade was dead.</L>
<L>In these Bath-charities a tax he'd found</L>
<L>More heavy than—four shillings in the pound.</L>
<L><PB N="284" REF="286"/>What with the play-house, hospital, and abbey,</L>
<L>A man was <HI>strip'd</HI>—unless he'd look quite shabby.</L>

<L>My lady, all the brats, and cousin Kit —</L>

<L>Old lady Slipslop, at her morning cards,</L>

<L>I hope your lordship—then my lord replies—</L>

<L>In Milton's days such stuff might be the taste,</L>
<L>But faith! he thought it was damn'd dull and chaste.</L>
<L>Then swears, he to the charity is hearty,</L>
<L>But can't, in honour, break his evening party.</L>

<LG>
<L>When to the gouty alderman I sued,</L>

<L>Is begging grown the fashion, with a pox!</L>
<L>The mayor should set such housewives in the stocks.</L>

<L>AS Bathian Venus t'other day</L>
<L>Invited all the Gods to tea,</L>
<L>Her maids of honour, the miss Graces,</L>
<L>Attending duely in their places,</L>
<L>Their godships gave a loose to mirth,</L>
<L>As we at Butt'ring's here on earth.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Minerva in her usual way</L>
<L>Rallied the daughter of the sea.</L>
<L>Madam, said she, your lov'd resort,</L>
<L>The city where you hold your court,</L>
<L>Is lately fallen from its duty,</L>
<L>And triumphs more in wit than beauty;</L>
<L>For here, she cried; see here a poem—</L>
<L>'Tis Dalston's; you, Apollo, know him.</L>
<L>Little persuasion sure invites</L>
<L>Pallas to read what Dalston writes:</L>
<L>Nay, I have heard that in Parnassus</L>
<L>For truth a current whisper passes,</L>
<L>That Dalston sometimes has been known</L>

</LG>

<L>Minerva read, and every God</L>
<L>Approv'd—Jove gave the critic nod:</L>
<L>Apollo and the sacred Nine</L>
<L>Were charm'd, and smil'd at ev'ry line;</L>
<L>And Mars, who little understood,</L>
<L>Swore, d—n him, if it was not good.</L>
<L>Venus alone sat all the while</L>
<L>Silent, nor deign'd a single smile.</L>

<L>For well the little rogue discern'd</L>
<L>At what his mother was concern'd,</L>
<L>Yet not a word the urchin said,</L>
<L>But hid in Hebe's lap his head.</L>
<L>At length the rising choler broke</L>
<L>From Venus' lips,—and thus she spoke,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>That poetry so cram'd with wit,</L>
<L>Minerva, shou'd your palate hit,</L>
<L>I wonder not, nor that some prudes</L>

<L>Shou'd wish the prize of beauty torn</L>
<L>From her they view with envious scorn.</L>

<L>Justice and truth direct their pen.</L>
<L>This Dalston—formerly I've known him;</L>

<L>Nor apt to give nor apt to take offence.</L>

<L>No bolder champion in religion's cause;</L>
<L>None fought more battles, nor with more applause.</L>

<HEAD>THE TOMB of SHAKESPEAR. A VISION.</HEAD>

<LG>
<L>WHAT time the jocund rosie-bosom'd HOURS</L>
<L>Led forth the train of PHOEBUS and the SPRING,</L>
<L>And ZEPHYR mild profusely scatter'd flowers</L>
<L>On Earth's green mantle from his musky wing,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thr MORN unbarr'd th' ambrosial gates of light,</L>
<L>Westward the raven-pinion'd Darkness flew,</L>
<L>The Landscape smil'd in vernal beauty bright,</L>
<L>And to their graves the sullen Ghosts withdrew.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The nightingale no longer swell'd her throat</L>
<L>With love-lorn plainings tremulous and slow,</L>
<L>And on the wings of Silence ceas'd to float</L>
<L>The gurgling notes of her melodious woe:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="326" REF="328"/>
<L>The God of sleep mysterious visions led</L>
<L>In gay procession 'fore the mental eye,</L>
<L>And my free'd soul awhile her mansion fled,</L>
<L>To try her plumes for immortality.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thro' fields of air, methought, I took my flight,</L>
<L>Thro' ev'ry clime, o'er ev'ry region pass'd,</L>
<L>No paradise or ruin 'scap'd my sight,</L>
<L>HESPERIAN garden, or CIMMERIAN waste.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>On AVON'S banks I lit, whose streams appear</L>
<L>To wind with eddies fond round SHAKESPEAR'S tomb,</L>
<L>The year's first feath'ry songsters warble near,</L>
<L>And vi'lets breathe, and earliest roses bloom.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Here FANCY sat, (her dewy fingers cold</L>
<L>Decking with flow'rets fresh th' unsullied sod,)</L>
<L>And bath'd with tears the sad sepulchral mold,</L>
<L>Her fav'rite offspring's long and last abode.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ah! what avails, she cry'd, a Poet's name?</L>
<L>Ah! what avails th' immortalizing breath</L>
<L>To snatch from dumb Oblivion other's fame?</L>
<L>My darling child here lies a prey to Death!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Let gentle OTWAY, white-rob'd PITY'S priest,</L>
<L>From grief domestic teach the tears to flow,</L>
<L>Or SOUTHERN captivate th' impassion'd breast</L>
<L>With heart-felt sighs and sympathy of woe.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="327" REF="329"/>
<L>For not to these <HI>his</HI> genius was confin'd,</L>
<L>Nature and I each tuneful pow'r had given,</L>
<L>Poetic transports of the madding mind,</L>
<L>And the wing'd words that waft the soul to heaven:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The fiery glance of th' intellectual eye,</L>
<L>Piercing all objects of creation's store,</L>
<L>Which on this world's extended surface lie;</L>
<L>And plastic thought that still created more.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O grant, with eager rapture I reply'd,</L>

<L>To whom thy son gave immortality.</L>

<L>Sweet FANCY smil'd, and wav'd her mystic rod,</L>
<L>When strait these visions felt her pow'rful arm,</L>
<L>And one by one succeeded at her nod,</L>
<L>As vassal sprites obey the wizard's charm.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>First a celestial form <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Ariel in the Tempest.</NOTE> (of azure hue</L>
<L>Whose mantle, bound with brede aetherial, flow'd</L>
<L>To each soft breeze its balmy breath that drew)</L>
<L>Swift down the sun-beams of the noon-tide rode.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Obedient to the necromantic sway</L>
<L>Of an old sage to solitude resign'd,</L>
<L>With fenny vapors he obscur'd the day,</L>
<L>Launch'd the long lightning, and let loose the wind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="328" REF="330"/>
<L>He whirl'd the tempest thro' the howling air,</L>
<L>Rattled the dreadful thunderclap on high,</L>
<L>And rais'd a roaring elemental war</L>
<L>Betwixt the sea-green waves and azure sky.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then, like heav'n's mild embassador of love</L>
<L>To man repentant, bade the tumult cease,</L>
<L>Smooth'd the blue bosom of the realms above,</L>
<L>And hush'd the rebel elements to peace.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Unlike to this in spirit or in mien</L>
<L>Another form <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Caliban in the Tempest.</NOTE> succeeded to my view;</L>
<L>A two-legg'd brute which Nature made in spleen,</L>
<L>Or from the loathing womb unfinish'd drew.</L>

<L>Scarce cou'd he syllable the curse he thought,</L>

<L>The flow'ry margin <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Fairy-land from the Midsummer night's dream.</NOTE> of a silent stream,</L>

<LG>
<L>Arm'd cap-a-pee forth march'd the fairy king,</L>
<L>A stouter warrior never took the field,</L>
<L>His threat'ning lance a hornet's horrid sting,</L>
<L>The sharded beetle's scale his sable shield.</L>

<L>Around their chief the elfin host appear'd,</L>
<L>Each little helmet sparkled like a star,</L>

<L>The scene then chang'd, from this romantic land,</L>

<L>Where three smart sisters <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">The witches in Macbeth.</NOTE> of the <HI>weird</HI> band</L>
<L>Were mutt'ring curses to the troublous wind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Pale Want had wither'd every furrow'd face,</L>
<L>Bow'd was each carcase with the weight of years,</L>
<L>And each sunk eye-ball from its hollow case</L>
<L>Distill'd cold rheum's involuntary tears.</L>

<L>Deep in a gloomy grot remote from day,</L>

<L>Yet still the dear ENCHANTRESS of the brain</L>
