<P>THE DESERTER. A NEW MUSICAL DRAMA, As it is performed at the THEATRE-ROYAL IN DRURY-LANE.</P>

<HEAD>To the PUBLIC.</HEAD>
<P>LE DESERTEUR, is well known to have been these five years the most fa∣vourite Musical Piece on the French stage: so great indeed has been its success, that in this short time it has been translated into three languages; one of which translations we have lately seen at the King's Theatre in the Hay-market, under the title of <HI>Il Deser∣tore.</HI></P>
<P>Indeed, when you once admit the circum∣stance of Henry's consessing himself a de∣serter, nothing can be more truly interesting than some of the incidents; but yet they were brought about in a way peculiarly cal∣culated for the French stage: the resolution of Henry was too sudden, too unprepared, as well as the circumstance of the mock-wedding that precedes it; and throughout the piece there were a number of cold inani∣mating occurrences, that had very little, if any, relation to the main design; and, add to this, it was never intended for an Opera, for the author himself calls it a Comedy, in∣terspersed with Songs.</P>
<P>It was thought, therefore, that if the un∣necessary incidents were expunged, and those retained were rendered more probable; if,
<PB N="4" REF="5"/>
by making an uniform partition between the dialogue and the songs, it could be brought more to wear the complexion of an Opera, <HI>The Deserter</HI> might be entitled to a favour∣able reception on the English stage: how far these suggestions were reasonable, the public (who are the best judges, and by whose arbitration I shall always be proud to abide) will determine.</P>
<P>With regard to the Music, as I found it a work of great invention, I should have kept it in its original state, had it been pos∣sible; but besides the excessive length of the songs, the continual breaks into recitative, the frequent sudden alterations of the stile, and above all, that sameness which so parti∣cularly characterizes the French Music, I found it much too grave to stand the least chance of success in an after-piece: I, there∣fore, selected what I thought the beauties; and what I could not effect by having re∣course to the original, I have endeavoured to supply myself.</P>
<P>In justice to the French composer, I think it absolutely necessary to declare, that the songs, beginning "<HI>One conduct's for both love and war;</HI>" "<HI>The nymph who in my bosom reigns;</HI>" "<HI>Mr. Simkin, I'd have you to know;</HI>" and "<HI>The whims of folks in love;</HI>" are wholly my own; and that the first air in the piece, and that beginning, "<HI>My life's three parts</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="6"/>
<HI>diminish'd,</HI>" are by Philidor, a name of no inconsiderable note in the musical world.</P>
<P>I have nothing to add but that I take this opportunity of making my acknowledgments to the performers for the support they were of to this piece; I would, indeed, but that I despair of finding words worthy the occasi∣on, express my gratitude to the public for their favourable reception of it.</P>

<P>Ah, she's a dear good lady indeed, and we all of us ought to do every thing she orders us.</P>

<P>I and my family in particular ought, for ma∣ny's the good thing she has given me, and my old dame; then how kind she was to all my poor child∣ren! she stood god-mother to this, and had her chris∣tened after her own name.</P>

<P>So he is.</P>

<P>And because she has a value for every thing that belongs to me, this good lady, about three weeks ago, sent to the colonel for his discharge, that the young folks may live at home at their ease, and be as happy as the day is long.</P>

<P>Yes, but now comes the mischief of it; what has occasion'd it, I don't know; I never saw any harm of the lad, but there are always busy tongues in this village, doing people ill-offices; and such reports, within these few days, have reached the Duchess's ears, that she is determined to see further into this business, before she gives Louisa the portion she pro∣mised her.</P>

<P>You may thank me for that.</P>

<P>Perhaps not.</P>

<P>Well, child, I am sure you can't wish it more than I do; nothing has ever pleas'd me so much as the thought of your coming together; I wish to see you married with all my heart: for I shall then have nothing to do, but to listen to the prattle of your children, and prepare myself to follow poor Dorothy.</P>

<P>Well, well, dont't make yourself uneasy, I dare say he loves you as sincerely as you think he does; if so, he'll soon be undeceived, and we shall finish the day as happily as we could wish: in the mean time let us think of what we have to do; we are to pretend we came from the church; the fiddles and bagpipes are to go first, then the lads and lasses follow; after which, mind this now, we are to go to the Duchess's mansion in grand procession, and there to be feasted like so many princes and princesses.</P>

<P>As the army were returning to the camp, assist∣ed in her resolution by her love for you, to the astonish∣ment of all who saw her, she rush'd like lightning through the ranks, made her way to the king himself, fell at his feet,—and, after modestly relating the circumstances of thy innocence, and her own distress, vow'd never to rise till she obtain'd the life of her lover: the king, having heard her story with that clemency which always ac∣companies a noble mind, granted thy life to her inter∣cession;

and the pomp pass'd on amidst the acclamati∣ons of the people.</P>

<L>My kind preserver! fain I'd speak,</L>

<L>Brothers, companions, age and youth;</L>
<L>Oh! tell to all the world her fame,</L>
<L>And when they ask for faith and truth,</L>

<L>Thus when the storm, dispersing, flies,</L>
