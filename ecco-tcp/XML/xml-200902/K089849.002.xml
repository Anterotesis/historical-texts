<L>Aureus &amp; simili frondescit Virga metallo.</L>
<BIBL><HI>VIRG.</HI></BIBL></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T has for a long Time been an Objection to the Writer of Periodical Essays, that every Subject is pre-occupied, that the <HI>Spectator,</HI> the <HI>Tatler,</HI> and the <HI>Guardian</HI> have culti∣vated every Field of Reflection, and that there remains nothing at present to be gleaned by successive Adven∣turers. Though I have all the Respect due to the Me∣mory of the excellent Writers of the Performances just mentioned, I am far from paying them a blind Adora∣tion; on the contrary, amidst all that surprizing Ema∣nation of Genius, Wit, and Humour, which distin∣guishes many of their Writings, I can sometimes descry a Subject carelesly treated, without any of their usual Turns of Sentiment, or Beauties of Diction. I
<PB N="2" REF="5"/>have now and then gone through a Series of important Trifles, and I have occasionally found them vague upon Subjects of Criticism, indeterminate in their Ex∣pressions, and loose in their Definitions. If this hap∣pens to be the Case, would it not be an erroneous Pro∣ceeding to suppress every other Attempt, because Sir <HI>Richard Steel</HI> planned so many Years before? Nay, even if they were free from any of those Blemishes, which arise either from Inadvertence or the Imbecillity of hu∣man Nature, would it not be absurd to extinguish the Seeds of laudable Emulation? Had the Rigour of this Sentence been carried into Execution, the World would never have been favoured with the admirable Perfor∣mances of the Author of the <HI>Rambler.</HI> That the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> Language has received from this Writer many ad∣ditional Ornaments, it is, I believe, universally felt by all Men of Taste. Every Topic is by him treated with great Erudition and strong Sense, enlivened with all the glowing Colourings of a warm Imagination, and the whole carried on with a nervous, clear, and har∣monious Stile. If the Performance in general has not the Variety of the <HI>Spectator,</HI> it is because Mr. <HI>Johnson</HI> wrote singly and alone, whereas the former was supported by several of eminent Abilities, and there∣fore, in the present Age there seems nothing want∣ing but a Coalition of Men of Parts to equal our Predecessors in all Manner of Periodical Writings.</P>
<P>Certain it is, there are many Topics in every branch of Science and in all the liberal Arts, which may still receive new Lights, and conduce both to the Enter∣tainment and Instruction of the Public. Since Mr. <HI>Addison</HI>'s Time, a <HI>Du Bos</HI> has shone forth in <HI>France,</HI> and a <HI>Spence</HI> in <HI>England;</HI> and the late ingenious Editor of a Translation of <HI>Virgil</HI> is a convincing Proof that Rules for fine Writing, and Precepts of critical Knowledge may be still enforced with great Elegance and Pro∣priety, though the Essays on <HI>Milton</HI>'s <HI>Paradise Lost,</HI> and
<PB N="3" REF="6"/>on the <HI>Pleasures of Imagination,</HI> must be allowed to have all the masterly Strokes, that can result from a delicate and refined Taste. The Regions of Reflection are like a Champain Country, in which different Objects present themselves in various Attitudes to the Eye, and the Imagination is frequently caught by Parts of the Prospect, which have escaped another's Observation, each Person receiving different Sensations, according as the Fancy is disposed for the Sublime, the Wonderful, or the Beautiful in the natural World.</P>
<P>Besides; the continual Fluctuation of Fashions, Cus∣toms and Manners must always afford fresh Matter for the Satyrist of Wit and Humour. The Tree of Folly is like the Tree mentioned by the Author of my Motto; though many have plucked a Branch from it, it is always quickly replaced by another, and the new Growth shoots into Day-light with undiminished Fertility.</P>
<P>Are there those who are pleased to indulge a delicate Vein of Raillery on the Foibles and Piccadillos of the Fair? Never was there more ample room to display a Turn of Wit, in this Way, than what the present Times are so happy as to afford. The Hoop has of late swelled to a wider Circumference than ever, and by the Help of a few formidable Rows of Steel, threatens Mischief to the whole Circle of Beaux, who cannot now approach the Ladies in their Entrenchments, with∣out manifest Danger of fracturing a Shin-bone, hurting the Pan of the Knee, or some such Disaster While this Fashion prevails, the Ladies may be charged with carrying concealed Arms, and making Use of masked Barteries; for which, by the Way, they have no manner of Occasion as they seem at present to be in Possession of more Courage than any <HI>Amazon</HI> mentioned in Hi∣story. For whereas those Viragos used to encounter with ONLY ONE BREAST EXERTED, the modern La∣dies are not afraid of meeting the Men with both quite naked and displayed to View. The Head is also
<PB N="4" REF="7"/>built up many Stories higher than it used to be, and the Art of Painting is now arrived to such Perfection, that it is absolutely impossible to know a female Ac∣quaintance for any length of Time, each lovely Fair having as many Faces and Complexions, as Gloves, Fans or Tippets. Add to this, that you may meet a Lady To-day with an elegant Shape, fine by Degrees and delicately less, and To-morrow she will appear as big round the Waist, as if within a few Days of her Time. Besides this, <HI>Cribbidge</HI> has suppressed the Reign of Love, and <HI>Cupid</HI> minds nothing now but cogging the Dice, or procuring a Pair-Royal at Brag; and in∣deed the present happy Disposition for Luxury, and every Vice, Folly, Whim, Foible, Humour and Ex∣travagance seems to promise a very plentiful Crop every Year, so that after a Survey of this Metropolis, we may say with Mr. <HI>Addison</HI> in his Prologue to the tender Hus∣band, <Q>Here's still Encouragement for those that write.</Q></P>
<P>On this Account, though I have now felt the Anxiety of a Writer for twelve Months past, I have resolved with myself not to lay down my Pen, until I am warned to do it by the Lassitude of an Author, or, what is worse, the Lassitude of the Reader. At present however I do not find any Symptoms of this Sort in my own Breast, nor can I learn that my Paper declines with my Readers. In my Rambles since last <HI>Saturday,</HI> I did not meet with any Thing that made against me. At <HI>Sam</HI>'s Mr. <HI>Wood</HI> informed me, that, his Customers hope I am not going to leave off Trade. A Stationer at the <HI>Chapter</HI> Coffee∣house in St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s <HI>Church-yard,</HI> call'd with some Earnest∣ness for the <HI>Gray's-Inn Journal,</HI> and having Posses∣sion of it, he moistened a Corner of it with the Tip of his Tongue, and then holding it up to the Light "really, says he, its <HI>a very good Paper."</HI> At most Places in <HI>Fleet-street, Joe Clare</HI> with a Pinch of Snuff between his Fingers and the usual Flourish of his Arm
<PB N="5" REF="8"/>declared highly in my Favour. At the <HI>Bedford</HI> I could guess from some Whispers, which I casually overheard, that I am as striking a Character as ever. <Q>Hush—that's he—that's <HI>Ranger</HI></Q>—"was you ever in Company with him!"—<Q>No,—I should like to spend an Evening with him</Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI>—In the softer Climate of St. <HI>James</HI>'s Air, I was told, that my Bays are likely to flourish, and I was particularly assured, by a Gentleman who frequents the <HI>Cocoa tree</HI> in <HI>Pallmall,</HI> that <HI>Ranger</HI> has gained Ad∣mittance there notwithstanding their Attachment to the ADVENTORER.</P>
<P>Things standing thus, I am determined to persevere in my Undertaking, and I therefore take this Opportu∣nity to renew my Application to all the Gentlemen, Clergy, and Freeholders of <HI>Great Britain.</HI> In my first Number I declared myself a Candidate for their Fa∣vour, and I beg a Continuance of their Votes and In∣terest, until cogent Reaso is shall incline me to with∣draw myself from their Service —</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> I was against the <HI>Jew</HI> Bill.</P>

<P>IT is with great Pleasure, that I begin to scent the Winter Air, as I am informed by a very sensible Bookseller that an <HI>R,</HI> in the Month is not only good for Oysters, but also Writers of all Denominations. The Season is now opening, when all the Vices and Follies of this Metropolis will be carried on with fresh Alacrity, which will undoubtedly afford Variety of In∣telligence from all Quarters, to collect which I shall not spare either Trouble or Expence, though it must be al∣lowed that a One-Horse Chaise during the Summer-Season, and Two-pence to be paid at the Bar of every Coffee-house must in the End amount to a consider∣able Sum. But this I shall pay very willingly, and I
<PB N="6" REF="9"/>shall now begin to visit the several Academies, of which I have formerly given an Account. My Man TOM is somewhat like his Name-sake in the <HI>Conscious Lovers,</HI> and is perfectly acquainted with every <HI>Phillis</HI> in <HI>London,</HI> so that I cannot fail, through this Channel, of receiving the car<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iest Account of all Occurrences among the La∣dies, such as, <Q>who keeps most Card Tables, who plays deepest at Whist, who cheats with the best Grace, who has the best Wash for the Complexion, who has the handsomest Chair, and many other Points of equal Moment.</Q> A notable Speaker at the <HI>Robin-hood</HI> Society is to transmit me all the Dis∣courses upon Religion; and as to Politicks, the Talka∣tiveness of my Barber, while he is dabbing his Fist about my Face, and pulling my Nose into a thousand different Shapes, will abundantly qualify me in that Branch, and by these Means I flatter myself I shall greatly excel all my Brother Annalists and Historiogra∣phers, whether they appear in daily Papers or Maga∣zines.</P>

<P>The Tragedy of <HI>Romeo</HI> and <HI>Juliet</HI> was performed here on the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>th Instant; <HI>Romeo</HI> by Mr. <HI>Barry,</HI> and <HI>Juliet</HI> by Miss <HI>Nossiter,</HI> being her first Appearance upon any Stage. At her first Entrance the Delicacy of her Figure, an her graceful Distress obtained for her the warmest Applause, and, as she grew more animated in the Pro∣gress, she frequently surprized the House with the most alarming Attitudes. The faultering of her Resolution, whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> going to drink the composing Draught, was finely marked; the Fixure of her Eyes and Feebleness of her whole Person, when coming forward from the Tomb, and her Manner of holding her Lover's dead Body, and looking at the Fryar, when she cries out <Q>you shall not tear him from me,</Q> were all happily ima∣gined, and to crown the whole, her Action at stabbing
<PB N="7" REF="10"/>herself, was a very fine and affecting Circumstance. After this, it may not be improper to observe, that, a Fondness for Attitudes may carry a Performer to an Ex∣treme, as perhaps was the Case in her standing with an uplifted Arm in act to strike, when she says <Q>as with a Club dash out their Brains,</Q> because that Po∣sition denotes an Intent to knock down another. Be that as it may, if this young Actress studies the Manage∣ment of her Voice, and attains a more simple Elocu∣tion, she must prove an Acquisition to the Stage.</P>

<EPIGRAPH>
<Q>Scimus inurbanum Lepido seponere dicto.
<BIBL><HI>HOR.</HI></BIBL></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> Have in a former Paper delivered my Sen∣timents concerning the notable Art of Humbugging; I shall this Day throw to∣gether some cursory Reflections upon the Practice of Raillery, which, in my Opinion, it is the Interest of Society to explode from every Company.</P>
<P>I am induced into this Way of thinking from an Ob∣servation, that few People are properly qualified to exercise this Talent, there being hardly any Thing which requires so fine an Understanding, together with so much Delicacy in the Exertion of it. But as Matters are generally managed, there is nothing so coarse as the Attempts of those, who are ambitious of shining in Conversation, and are therefore determined to banter Mankind into an exalted Opinion of their Accomplish∣ments. The utmost that can be allowed to these Gen∣tlemen, is to join in the general Laugh; and, if Mirth should be going forward, they may very properly be admitted to partake of the frolic Festivity, without vain∣ly pretending to take the Lead, or to engross the Con∣versation
<PB N="8" REF="11"/>into their own Hands; in like Manner as the uninformed Country Squire should not be suffered by the Master of the Ceremonies in a polite Assembly, to come forward in a Minuet, where the Graces of Move∣ment are required, though he may be tolerated to romp in a Country Dance, and display all the Gambols of his unfashioned Agility.
<Q><L><HI>— Nec cum sis caetera fossor</HI></L>
<L><HI>Tres tantum ad numeros Satyri moveare Bathylli.</HI></L></Q> Were I to define Raillery, I should call it a delicate Exertion of Pleasantry upon the Foibles or the slight Inadvertences, which disclose themselves in the Actions of Men. From this View of Matters, it will appear, that no Tincture of Ill-nature must be suffered to disfigure the Surface; that only slight Errors must be the Ground on which the Colouring is laid, and that good Manners must give a Polish to the Whole. No Man has any Degree of Right to invade another's inward Peace, and therefore a well turned Mind will always decline any Thing that comes home to the Bosom of any Person, with whom he is willing to enter into Society. What∣ever may tend to create Dis-esteem in the Circle of our Acquaintance, or to throw a ridiculous Light upon a Character; whatever may excite uneasy Sensations by touching upon Circumstances, about which it is possible a Person may have a tender Feeling, though in their own Nature, they are not of any material Importance; in short, all Topics, but such, as we are convinced the the Object of our Merriment will give up, are care∣fully to be avoided; and it will be always highly ne∣cessary so to glide gently over the affected Part, that the Wound may appear to be probed by a skilful Hand. I have somewhere read a Story of <HI>Jack Ketch</HI>'s Wife, which I think throws a Light on this Matter. Any Body, says that elegant Lady, can tuck a Man up, and stop his Breath, but to do it with Dexterity, and make
<PB N="9" REF="12"/>the Culprit die an easy pleasant Death, is only the gen∣teel Qualification of my Husband. Thus it requires no very shining Abilities to inform our Neighbour of his Oddities, and point out to him his slight Indiscre∣tions; but to open his Eyes, and let in the Light with∣out rendering it painful to him; to give a Sense of the Foible without disturbing the natural Complacence, with which every one is willing to behold himself, is a Task which requires more Elegance and Refinement than hap∣pens to fall to the Share of every Individual. And yet there is no going any where without meeting Preten∣ders in this Way; every Quarter of the Town abounds with Men of Raillery, and to all these it is necessary to render an Account of our Actions, our Friends, our Attachments, our Cloaths, our Walk, and what not? To all these notable Personages I would beg leave to recommend the following Story. A Gentleman was one Day shaving himself in his Parlour to the great Ad∣miration of <HI>Otho,</HI> his Monkey, who stood by him won∣derfully pleased with the Turn of his Wrist, and the Dexterity of every Stroke. The Operation being finish∣ed, and the Gentleman gone out without laying up his Utensils, <HI>Otho</HI> mounts the Table, fixes himself before the Glass and flourishes the Razor with mimic Skill, till unfortunately he cut his Jaw across, and then too late found the Danger of playing with Edge Tools:</P>
<P>I have drawn up an allegorical Account of the Birth and Parentage of <HI>Raillery,</HI> which, I think, may serve to lay before the Reader its several efficient Qualities.</P>
<P>GOOD-SENSE and RIDICULE were joined in Wed∣lock; the Offspring of their Marriage was HUMOUR, who for a long Time roved about <HI>Parnassus,</HI> placing the Follies and Whims of Mankind in such a Light, as never failed to excite Mirth in the Synod of <HI>Apollo</HI> and the Muses. At length happening to wander out of Bounds, HUMOUR met, upon the Borders of <HI>Par∣nassus,</HI> just upon the Verge of worldly Commerce, a
<PB N="10" REF="13"/>certain Lady known by the Name of ILL-NATURE. Drawn in by false Allurements and a glavering Smile, which ILL-NATURE always wore upon her Countenance, HUMOUR offered Proposals of Marriage, which were carried without Delay into Execution, and in nine Months Time RAILING was ushered into the World. With a small Mixture in his Composition of his Father's Qualities strongly blended with the complexional Habits of his Mother, RAILING grew up in the Practice of ex∣posing the infirmities of all who came in his Way. With∣out Restraint he took unbecoming Liberties with private Families, sowed the Seeds of Discontent in every Breast, and in Time began to disturb the Harmony of the sacred Nine. Whereupon <HI>Thalia,</HI> conceived an Aversion to him, and in order to mend the Breed preferred a Pe∣tition to <HI>Apollo</HI> to divorce HUMOUR from his Wife ILL∣NATURE.</P>
<P>After a full hearing of the Cause. <HI>Apollo</HI> issued out his Edict of Separation. HUMOUR could not live single, and in a short Time made another Match, which, as good Luck would have it, turned out better than the former. His second Wife's Name was WIT, a Lady of great Vivacity, and abounding in surprizing Turns in all her Conversation. She hardly could see any Thing, but her Way was instantly to compare it to some other Object in Nature, and she frequently would make her Auditors laugh by pointing out a latent Resemblance in Things, which seemed in their own Natures abso∣lutely repugnant to each other. Her principal Atten∣tion was to set off her Husband, and though she was fond of great Variety in her Dress, she would upon many Occasions lend her best Apparel to HUMOUR, who never failed to look most engaging, when WIT contributed her Ornaments. HUMOUR, in his Turn, gave supernumerary Embellishments to his Wife, and they both reflected a reciprocal Lustre upon each other. They continued in a State of mutual Fondness, and
<PB N="11" REF="14"/>their faithful Love was in Time rewarded with a tender Daughter, who was immediately called, with the ge∣neral Consent, by the Name of RAILERY. The MUSES cherished her in their Bosoms, and as she grew up she discovered a Propensity to her Father's Way of thinking, but with a considerable Abatement of his Se∣verity. The Mother's Delicacy she possessed entire, and whenever she touched upon any Thing, like her, she endeavoured to give it an agreeable Colouring. In this Habit she was further confirmed by POLITENE<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>S, a collateral Relation by the Mother's Side, who took upon her the Care of her Manners, and instructed her perfectly in all the secondary Qualities or lesser Morals, which are commonly known by the Name of Good-breeding. Being confirmed in these Principles RAIL∣LERY was, at a mature Age, trusted abroad into the World, where she had not been long before she was ca∣ressed by the courtly <HI>Horace,</HI> who took her Home to his own House, introduced her to <HI>Mecaenas,</HI> and found her of singular Service in all his Writings. At the Demise of that Bard, RAILLERY wandered a Vagrant up and down, till at length she took it into her Head to visit <HI>Boileau</HI> in <HI>Paris;</HI> from whence she came over to <HI>England</HI> and resided for many Years at <HI>Twickenham</HI> with the late Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> from whose Retreat she would now and then make an Excursion to pass some Hours with Doctor <HI>Young</HI> and Mr. <HI>Addison.</HI> At present, it is said, that she is taken into Keeping by a certain noble Earl, of whom she is so enamoured, that it is confidently reported, she will not quit his Company, though he is now in Danger of becoming deaf; and it is further said, that she will stick by him to his last Breath; but, at that unhappy Juncture what will become of her, no Body can pretend to de∣termine.</P>

<HEAD><HI>To</HI> CHARLES RANGER, <HI><ABBR>Esq</ABBR></HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE <HI>Exercise of the Fan</HI> was proposed in the Days of the <HI>Spectator,</HI> as a Study highly ne∣cessary to the Ladies of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> and the Scheme, offered to their Consideration, included all the requi∣site Perfections in the Management of that pretty ver∣satile Machine. Though I must allow that Directions of this Nature were greatly conducive to a proper Display of many female Charms, there is still a more useful System of Rules for the playing off Love's Ar∣tillery, which I beg Leave, through the Channel of your Paper, to convey to the Notice of my beautiful Countrywomen. The System of Rules which I here intend, is the <HI>Exercise of the Lips,</HI> and, after mature Consideration, I think the whole Secret may be com∣prized under the following Heads.</P>
<LIST>
<PB N="14" REF="17"/>
<ITEM><HI>Moisten your Lips,</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Bite your Lips,</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Open your Lips,</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Close your Lips,</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Pout your Lips,</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Rest your Lips.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>The Mouth being a leading Feature in the Counte∣nance, and the Seat of the Graces, where all the winning Loves and each amiable Smile have planted their Al∣lurements, there cannot be too much Care employed by the Ladies to acquire a Pair of well disciplined Lips, readily obedient to each of the Rules above established, and capable with Quickness and Ease to perform every Branch of this delectable Exercise.</P>
<P>With Regard to the first Word of Command; a due Degree of Moisture gives a sparkling Lustre to the na∣tural Vermillion of the Skin, like Roses fresh be∣sprinkled with the Morning-Dew; it contributes like∣wise to hinder them from appearing dry and rough, as is generally the Case with old Maids; the least Sus∣picion of which the Ladies seem willing to avoid, by the present Taste of extending the Shape beyond its just Proportion, by a fashionable Enormity of the Stays.</P>
<P><HI>Biting the Lips</HI> is attended with more Difficulty than the premised Rule, because it is more complicated in its Nature and includes the Operation of the Passions. There are always many Topics in Conversation, upon which this Practice, if well managed, has a very expres∣sive Significance. When, for Instance, disagreeable Thoughts obtrude, it serves to excite new Ideas in the Fancy; it likewise prevents the unseasonable Eruption of a conscious Laugh, when the Libertine Wit of <HI>Con∣greve</HI> or <HI>Vanbrugh,</HI> provokes a betraying Simper; not to mention that it helps to heighten the natural Redness of the Lip, and raises a Degree of Anxiety in the Men, for Fear the Delicacy of the Skin should suffer too much from too violent a Pressure.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="18"/>I do not doubt, but it may seem perfectly easy to open the Lips, but this also I take to be a Matter of no small Difficulty. Very few, it is observable, open their Lips to any Purpose; besides it should never be done with too great a Precipitance, but always gradually and by due Degrees. Should there happen to be drawn up, within, an elegant Row of beautiful white Teeth, it will be sure to add greatly to the natural Bloom, by exhibiting an agreeable Contrast; like Ivory stained with a just Arrangement of crimson Colours. On this Head it may not be improper to caution my pretty Rea∣ders against an indolent Custom of relaxing into a Yawn, which distends the Mouth beyond its proper Size, and generally occasions the witty Saying, <Q><HI>Thank you for not swallowing me.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Before the Lips are closed, it is eligible to confer up∣pon them a new Refreshment of Moisture, and, to en∣liven the Colour: If they were to undergo the Opera∣tion of Biting, I should not think it amiss. Shutting the Lips I have often remarked, is extremely becom∣ing in most Ladies, and, I think, cannot be too much practised by old Maids, Wives, and indeed the Gene∣rality of Women. In closing them, however, there are different Degrees of Pressure to be observed, because in this also the Passions are concerned. When they gently touch each other, it gives a Variety to the Air of the Face, by giving it an unusual Degree of Length; but in this, those, who have naturally a long Visage, are to be particularly cautious. When somewhat com∣pressed, the Dimples in the Cheeks are displayed to Advantage, and the whole Face is enlivened with a pleasing Serenity. If squeezed close together, it throws a beautiful Pensiveness into the Looks, which is seldom acquired to any Degree of Perfection by the Generality of the Sex; but when properly attained, it carries with it an elegant Kind of dumb Eloquence, which the
<PB N="16" REF="19"/>Critics have observed, is often a great Beauty in Poe∣try, and certainly has its Portion of Grace among the fair Sex. I know a Gentleman who can read the Thoughts of any Lady whatever by observing the Ad∣justment of the Lips. He tells me, he has observed a Pair of Lips speak, without any Motion for an Hour together, and he has a List of Lips, which he says, are absolute Prudes; others that are Rakes; some that are amorous, and some that are swelled with Pride, and from a long Course of Enquiry he finds that they have more Electricity than any other Substance in Nature.</P>
<P>But these Remarks belong more immediately to the following Head of <HI>Pouting the Lips,</HI> which is more diffi∣cult than any Rule advanced as yet. In doing this, it will be always found expedient to moisten and bite them first, that, when prominent, the Under-lip may look as if pregnant with Delight. The Passions of Scorn, Indignation, Contempt, and the whole Family of Pride, are finely marked by this Position. I have known a pouted Lip to look down upon a Rival Beauty during an entire Tragedy, and I have seen a Lady, without uttering a single Word, tell a Man, that she thought him an unmannered Coxcomb, by a forcible Exertion of this expressive Feature. I must observe, that this Practice becomes handsome Faces only; to such it gives an Air of Elevation, or a pretty Sullenness, which throws a kind of amiable Severity over the whole Coun∣tenance. Ugly Women seldom have this Art in any Perfection.</P>
<P>The last Rule is to <HI>Rest your Lips,</HI> and is the most neglected of any, though highly essential in this beau∣tiful Language. Young Girls can never be brought to pay the least Attention to this Precept; but were they sensible, that when the Features are lest to display their own native Graces without Art, their Charms are irre∣sistible, I am convinced this Word of Direction would be better observed. This Rule is more extensive than
<PB N="17" REF="20"/>the foregoing, because it is proper for all Ladies in ge∣neral, whereas the former should never be practised but by such of the Fair, as are blessed with a blooming Com∣plexion and a Delicacy of Features.</P>
<P>The Bounds of Mr. <HI>Ranger</HI>'s Paper will not permit me to expatiate further; I shall therefore, at Maturity, publish by Subscription an entire Book, called the <HI>Oeconomy of the Lips;</HI> in which I shall explain at large the Doctrine here delivered, and I shall adapt each Article to the Make of the Countenance. The whole shall be concluded with <HI>an Essay on the Passions of the Fe∣male Lips,</HI> and to the Honour of this Part of the Face, I shall prove, that in these Days of <HI>Atheism,</HI> all Reli∣gion is centered with them, as what few Prayers are said at present, come from the Lips only, without the <HI>Understanding</HI> or <HI>Heart</HI> being at all concerned in the Matter. I have the Honour to be,</P>

<LETTER>
<HEAD><HI>To</HI> CHARLES RANGER, <HI><ABBR>Esq</ABBR></HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>MIDST all the frolic Excursions of Fancy to which you have occasionally given vent in your <HI>Saturday</HI>'s Compositions, I have ob∣served that there is not one of them but has some Degree of Tendency to the Instruction, as well as Entertainment of your Readers. On this Account, I hope you will not refuse a Place in your Paper to a Correspondent, who means to shew the Futility of a Maxim, which has gained Credit with most People, though extremely ill-grounded, as, I think, I can fairly evince, from an experimental Knowledge of Mankind.</P>
<P>You undoubtedly recollect that <HI>Ovid</HI> has in one of his Elegies the following Lines.</P>
<Q><L><HI>Donec eris felix multos numerabis Amicos;</HI></L>
<L><HI>Tempora si fuerint nubila, solus eris.</HI></L></Q>
<P>Now, Sir, it is so far from being true, that a Man is surrounded with Friends in Prosperity, and is left desti∣tute under his Misfortunes, that I will undertake to prove the very Reverse; in doing this I flatter myself I shall serve the Purposes of Virtue, and vindicate the Dignity of human Nature.</P>
<P>You must know then, that I came to this Town, a few Years since, with Intent to read the Law, having just Fortune enough to support me in my Studies, until I might fix myself in a tolerable Road of Business. For this Purpose I lodged in one of the Inns of Court, and
<PB N="21" REF="24"/>the Oeconomy, which I was obliged to observe, ren∣dering it impossible for me to go much into Company, I soon found out that I led a very muzzy Sort of a Life. I therefore shifted the Scene, and though, in a short Time, I found means to run out my little Fortune, I cannot say, that I was relinquished by the World on this Account. It is true that some of my Acquaintance totally deserted me, but it was the Occasion, at the same Time, that others were more earnestly attached than they would otherwise have been. I remember the last Word my Aunt in the Country said to me, was <Q><HI>Bob, wherever you go, be sure to make Friends for your∣self,</HI></Q> this Advice, I will venture to say, I have had the Address to conform to with great Success, as will appear from the Sequel.</P>
<P>Most of the Friendships of the World are Leagues in Debauchery and Intemperance, made in the drawing of a Cork, and often ended in the same Manner. <HI>Out of Sight out of Mind</HI> is certainly true, with Regard to the Generality of Connections, but the Impressions I have made upon the Minds of my Friends are not so easily effaced. On the contrary, when it happens that I am seldom seen by them, they are known to be in very great Solicitude about me, are constantly very earnest in, their Enquiries after me, and the Discourse they usually have with each other is, <Q>Have you seen our old Friend lately—I can't think what's become of him—I hope he is not gone out of Town—I have not seen him for a long Time,—faith, I'm very uneasy about him—I wish to God he would see and settle his Affairs—He's a very careless young Fellow—a great deal too wild — throws away his Money like Dirt—I have call∣ed upon him Morning after Morning, but all to no Purpose—I'd give a Bottle of Wine I could meet with him—I'd rather that than my Dinner—I never long'd so much to see any body.</Q></P>
<P>These are the general Expressions of Anxiety which my Friends express on my Account, and there are
<PB N="22" REF="25"/>some of them who are not content to rest here; Words cost nothing; they carry the Thing to such a Length as to employ a Couple of Fellows, who are daily in all Quarters of the Town hunting and prying about for me. As there are few Instances of such earnest Friendship in the World, I am sensible what I have said, may have a romantic Appearance, and Mr. <HI>Ranger</HI> may suggest to himself, that I am entertaining him all this Time with a Novel; but, Sir, I must take Leave to assure you that every Word is literally true, and what may perhaps raise your Idea still higher, is, not one of all these People has ever got a Shilling by me; and I verily believe few of them ever will. Having said thus much in the Praise of these my Well-wishers, it will naturally be desired of me, to inform the World who and what they are, who are in such Concern about a Stranger. Not to keep you any longer in Suspence I will now tell you, that I have experienced all this Generosity from my CREDITORS.</P>
<P>By this it will appear that the Pleasure of being in Debt, though very common in Life, is very little un∣derstood by the Generality of those, who addict them∣selves to this Gratification. The Art in all these Cases is to refine upon the Occurrences and Disappointments, to which our State is liable; and, for my Part, the Pleasure just mentioned is one of the most valuable Enjoyments of my Life. My Morning <HI>Levee</HI> is as great as any Nobleman's, whereas in the Days that that I could say I was in Possession of a Competence, I never had any Visitor whatever, except a Laundress to make my Bed in the <HI>Temple.</HI> But now the Case is perfectly altered; there is a constant Crowd of Attend∣ants about my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oors, and to those, that are admitted, I have the Pleasure of making as many Promises, as a Minister of State, besides a lofty Pride in keeping them much after the same Fashion. Upon these Occasions it will now and then happen, that they who best know
<PB N="23" REF="26"/>how to make their Court, and have the Art of taking a pliant Hour, sometimes prevail upon me to appoint a Day for the Completion of their Wishes. As Things of Consequence cannot be done in a violent Hurry, the Day, agreed upon is generally very distant, may be from six to nine or twelve Months, during which Space of Time, it is observable that their Good-nature never suffers the least Abatement, but they remain as solicitous as ever, frequently expressing the most ten∣der Regard for my Welfare. <Q>My dear Sir, do, take a little Care of yourself—It goes to my very Heart to hear you cough so hard—Why you'll not live three Months at this Rate—Be advised by me, and put a Stocking about your Neck To-night, and take something to sweat you a little and ease your Chest—You should not drink so much—Consider, it impairs both Constitution and Purse—You know it's for your Good I speak—You'd be a great Loss to your Friends—Take up a little, Flesh and Blood can't hold it always.</Q></P>
<P>Thus, Mr. <HI>Ranger,</HI> am I beloved, and that for no other Reason, but my Address in making Friends for myself, and I am so closely watched by these generous Creatures, that it is totally out of my Power to take any wrong Step, that might be detrimental to my Affairs. Of this I had a convincing Proof about a Year ago, when the Interposition of my Taylor hindered me from committing a very inconsiderate Action. I was going with a Friend to take a Trip to <HI>Paris,</HI> by which Ex∣pedition I must certainly have been drained of all my ready Money; but the Vigilance of my Friend contrived to have me stopped as I was just stepping into the Post-Chaise, and I was thence conducted to a generous Bai∣liff's House in <HI>Gray's-Inn Lane,</HI> for the Sum of Three Hundred Pounds. Here I remained confined till my Pas∣sion for Travel was perfectly cooled, and when I was at length restored to my Liberty, my abovementioned
<PB N="24" REF="27"/>Friends, took particular Care not to leave me a single Shilling, for Fear I should have the same unhappy Turn a second Time.</P>
<P>While I thus enjoy the Assiduity and Benevolence of such a Number, who are kind enough to interest them∣selves in my Affairs, I must own there is a Species of Creditors, who are an Exception to the general Rule; for though all those of whom I have hitherto been speaking, are upon every Occasion highly pleased to meet me, this last Class detest the very Sight of me. As I am not conscious that I have ever done any Thing to incur their Displeasure to so great a Degree, their Aversion shocks me the more; and notwithstanding all the Pains I have taken to soften them by Politeness they still remain inexorable. Whenever I do not pay them what is due to them, I endeavour to put them off with the handsomest Apology in my Power; but all to no Purpose; I have run too far in Arrears, and they are not by any Means to be satisfied. As I should be glad if you would give them a Word of Advice I will just hint to you that the Personages, whom I mean, are no other than GENTLEMEN'S SERVANTS. The Cry among them all is, What can a poor Serving-Man do, if he is robb'd of his just Vails by such Scoundrels? They are all very unwilling to let me run further in their Debt, and therefore it is I can hardly get any Thing out of their Hands. If I call for Beer at Table, they are sure not to hear me, till their Master orders them to serve the Gentleman; then I receive the Leavings of the Tankard just out of the Hands of the most ca∣pacious Swallow in the Company. In short, the Pee∣vishness of these my Creditors is a great Discount upon my Happiness, and I must confess there is no kind of Pleasure in being in Debt to them. However I must endeavour to bear this Inconvenience, and if you will be pleased to insert this Letter in the <HI>Gray</HI>'s <HI>Inn Journal</HI> I shall be proud to get into your Books, and shall have
<PB N="25" REF="28"/>the further Pleasure of being indebted to Mr. <HI>Ranger</HI> for this Act of Civility which will always oblige me to be,</P>

<Q>In omnes superbiâ (quae crudelitate gravior est bonis) grassatus —
<BIBL><HI>FLORUS.</HI></BIBL></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG> WRITER of periodical Essays is like one, who goes coasting from Place to Place, with Intent to lay down a Chart of the Course of the Country, the Extent of the several Parts, the Bearings, Limits and Connections. As the latter fails along, every minute Object furnishes him with Matter of Contemplation, and not a Hill lifts its Head, whether cloathed with Verdure and imbower∣ed with over-hanging Wood, or wild, barren and crag∣gy, but he instantly treasures it in the Storehouse of Imagination. Each Recess of the Land, each Creek, Rock and Harbour demand a particular Notice, and he is frequently induced to pause in these Reflections, heedless of the unbounded Prospect which the Ocean presents him. In like Manner, the Person who is en∣gaged in a Course of Lucubrations to be published on a stated Day, is constantly traversing about, in order to delineate a just Representation of the different Scenes of Life, and to gratify his Readers with particular Charts, which may either serve to please the Fancy, or contribute to the Purposes of Improvement and Utility. In his Intercourse with Men and Manners every Occur∣rence attracts his Eye; and in his Converse with Books, he often meets with Passages, which deserve to be minutely set down in the Account of his Voyage through this Sea of Troubles, and they may serve as Lights or Landmarks to those who are bound upon the same Adventure.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="37"/>It is thus the best Essays are suggested, and I must own, I never yet, perused a good Author, but I thence deduced some Hint, which afterwards unfolded several latent Reflections, that might otherwise escape me. The Classics are particularly useful in this Way; They display, upon all Occasions, such bright Traces of a manly Way of Thinking, and abound with so many excellent and close Remarks, artfully interwoven with the Thread of their Poem or Narration, that a Man conversant with their Productions will be always able to draw very amply from their Stores.</P>
<P>In perusing, a few Nights since, <HI>Florus</HI>'s <HI>Compendium</HI> of the <HI>Roman</HI> History, I was greatly struck with an Ob∣servation, in the Character of <HI>Tarquin,</HI> which that Wri∣ter, though no extraordinary Master of the Graces and Elegancies of Composition, has found Means to in∣sert with his usual Closeness. <Q><HI>Tarquin</HI> (says <HI>Florus</HI>) insulted all Mankind with an overbearing Pride, which, to an ingenuous Mind, is worse than Cruelty.</Q> This short Observation most certainly carries with it a great Deal of Truth, and deserves to be enforced with all the Strength of Reason and Eloquence.</P>
<P>A witty Satirist has called Pride the universal Passion, and indeed its Influence on Mankind is so manifest, that there is too much Reason to believe the Maxim well founded. The general Prevalence of Politeness suppresses in some Measure the Appearance of it among the <HI>French,</HI> but any one, who has been at <HI>Versailles,</HI> may remember, that after all the Attention and De∣ference of the embroidered Gentleman, who undertakes the Office of shewing the Curiosities of the Place, the Ceremony is always concluded with a Consciousness of their national Superiority, which breaks out in a brisk Question with a Shrug of the Shoulder. <Q><HI>Eh bien! Monsieur, avez vous <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e pareille magnificence à Londres.</HI> Well, Sir, have you any Thing equal to this in
<PB N="35" REF="38"/><HI>London.</HI></Q> In <HI>Italy, Portugal,</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI> their Haughti∣ness is manifested by the frequent Use of the Stilleto upon every trivial Occasion; Pride is there displayed by killing others, and the People of <HI>England</HI> discover it by murdering themselves.</P>
<P>The Notion of Independance with which a free-born <HI>Briton</HI> is inflamed, renders him untractable and re∣fractory to all Laws; <HI>Religion</HI> he makes a Joke of, and he wonders at the Impertinence of the Parliament in attempting to restrain his unquestionable Right to dispose of his Person as he pleases.</P>
<P>The famous <HI>Montesquieu</HI> imputes the Variety of Od∣dities, which prevail in this Country, to the general Infection of the Scurvy; but if he had charged it upon our national Sturdiness, I am inclinable to think, he would have assigned a truer Cause, though, perhaps, at the same Time, black and sizy Blood may not a little contribute to aggravate the Distemper. To speak with Precision, Pride is to the Soul what the Scurvy is to the Body, each in their separate Channels the Source of ill Humours, Maladies and Disorders. The fatal Ef∣fects of the corporal Indisposition, just mentioned, have been so severely felt for a long Time past, that our common News-Papers are filled with Advertisements of Chymical Drops, to eradicate it entirely out of the Blood. This certainly would have been a great Benefit to Society, but, I apprehend, he would deserve still more who should devise a Cure for the Disease of the Mind. On this Account I should be glad to see a Paragraph in the Papers to the following Effect.</P>
<Q><P>To Persons of either Sex, afflicted with any Species of <HI>PRIDE.</HI></P>
<P>NEVER were <HI>Pride, Arrogance,</HI> and <HI>Haughtiness</HI> so frequent as of late Years; nor has any Re∣medy been found adequate to this pernicious Habit, which occasioned a Physician of the Soul, who em∣ployed
<PB N="36" REF="39"/>his Thoughts much concerning them, to adapt a Medicine, or Moral Elixir, which is a sovereign Re∣medy against PRIDE and all the Variety of Symp∣toms, by which it mimics, by Turns, almost all the Vices poor Mortals are afflicted with, and have their Rise from a depraved Selfishness of Thinking, vicious Fer∣ments of Ill-nature, and the Want of Self-knowledge; whence proceed the supercilious Brow, and surly Mo∣roseness in the Men, and Coquetry, Airs, Fidgets, Tehees and Titters in the Women, which totally destroy their Beauty and their Features, and by a Consent of Parts affect their Heads, and produce direful Views and terrible Apprehensions; at other Times, Fits, flushing Heats, Lowness and Sinking of the Spirits, Palpitation of the Heart, Twitchings of the Limbs, with many convulsive Disorders, which affect Numbers of both Sexes.</P>
<P>The above Elixir is a wonderful Alterative, oc∣casions laudable Humility, and as soon as taken, makes the Patient good-humoured, chearful, and affable to Admiration, and is good for all Sorts of People to preserve, as well as procure, an even Temper of Mind.</P></Q>
<P>Whenever I meet with a proud Man, I should be glad to know what he takes himself for; and I have often imagined that if his inward State of Mind were detected to the Eye of the World, it would afford a ridiculous Contrast between his several Foibles and his fancied Elevation above the rest of his Species. For my Part, it never fails to divert me in a most exquisite Manner, when I observe a Man sit like his Grandsire cut in Alabaster, as <HI>Shakespear</HI> has it, in order to receive the Compliments of every one, without any real Merit to deserve them, and without that reciprocal Compla∣cence, which is always sure to procure Esteem. I would have such a one made Emperor of the Moon or re∣moved to some other Sphere fitted for his Reception,
<PB N="37" REF="40"/>where Cruelty may pass for Courage, Ostentation for Merit, and Pride for Dignity.</P>
<P>Nothing can so surely demonstrate a narrow Mind, as an Attempt to degrade our Fellow-Creatures by an haughty Arrogance of Carriage. <HI>Hamlet</HI> reckons the <HI>Insolence of Office</HI> and the <HI>proud Man</HI>'s <HI>Contumely</HI> among those Instigations which might prompt injured Merit to a Deed of extreme Despair, and this further enforces the Severity, which is felt by him, who is obliged to sub∣mit to it, and the Cruelty of that human Brute who can think of putting it in Practice.</P>
<P>I cannot dismiss this Paper without observing that there is a right Species of Pride to which every Man is entitled, and that is a Spirit above Dependance, above Flattery, above an abject Deportment, and above every Thing poor, sordid, and little. There is a Pride, which may serve to invigorate Honour, to embolden Truth, and to carry Virtue to an higher Pitch of Improvement, than it might attain unassisted by this secondary Mo∣tive. The Pleasures resulting from this Principle are manly and noble. To enjoy the inward Consciousness of Honor and Honesty, and to exult in the Conviction of a Person's own Integrity, Probity and upright Inten∣tions, is just and laudable. Thus much of Pride every one has a Right to, and I know no external Circum∣stance, that can reasonably entitle any Man alive to more.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>N a former Essay, I threw together a few Thoughts upon the <HI>Profession</HI> of an ACTOR; as a Sequel to that Piece, I shall this Day offer some loose Hints upon the <HI>Art;</HI> and though this Subject may not be interesting to every Reader, I yet persuade myself, as the Drama is the most polite and rational of our Diversions, that an Attempt to throw some Light upon the Matter, will be received with Candour.</P>
<P>The Precept, which the judicious Author of my Motto has laid down for the good Writer, is likewise the best Rule for an Actor; for as both are Professors
<PB N="39" REF="42"/>of imitative Arts, the same Rule is applicable to each. "I would recommend," says <HI>Horace,</HI> <Q>to the skilful Imitator a close and steady Observance of Men and Manners, and from that Source, I would have him draw an exact Resemblance, and the true Language of Nature.</Q> This Advice, short and simple as it is, contains the whole Secret of succeeding with the Pub∣lic; and whoever artfully conforms to it, will be sure of acquiring Applause from crowded Theatres. The Actor, in every Situation on the Stage, is a Copyist from hu∣man Life; the easy and genteel Deportment of Gen∣tlemen, is to be attained by an Intercourse and free Communication with People of that Class; the Draw∣ing-Room must be visited for a Knowledge of the Ease and Dignity of Men of Rank; and by this Habitude, the Performer will fashion himself into a Kind of men∣tal Elegance, which will not sail to inform his whole Per∣son, and set off every Action, with a graceful Facility, at the same Time that it will enable him to be upon all Occasions, a more perfect Imitator.</P>
<P>To these external Circumstances must be joined, a close and intimate Knowledge of the human Heart; its most secret Movements must be unfolded, and the Actor must be thoroughly acquainted with their minutest Effects upon the human Body, in what Proportion they agitate the Nerves and Muscles; how they impress the Features with their respective Signatures, elevate or con∣tract the Brow, brace or relax the Sinews, and com∣mand the Attitude and Disposition of the whole Person. There is not a Passion, in the whole Train of those Feel∣ings, to which our Nature is subject, but what has its own peculiar Adjuncts, its own Air, its own Look, and its own proper Tone. Sorrow unnerves the whole System, sinks the Spirits, and depresses the Voice into a plaintive Melancholy; Anger, on the other Hand, con∣tracts each Sinew, sends the Spirits in a Blaze to the Eye, and vents itself in precipitate and vehement Ac∣cents.
<PB N="40" REF="43"/>In like Manner, every Emotion of the Soul has a sympathetic Influence on the Structure of the Body, and it is the immediate Business of the Performer, who would aspire to Excellence in the Art, to form to him∣self an exact Definition of each Passion, with all its Characteristics; otherwise it will be impossible for him to mark the Progress and Workings of the Mind, awakened and excited by the Vehemence of their Im∣pulse, or to separate the tender Desire of a <HI>Romeo</HI> from the conjugal Affection of <HI>Jaffier.</HI></P>
<P>After having thus distinguished the Nature and Boun∣daries of each Affection, the next Step to be taken, is, to watch the various Shiftings and Veerings of the Soul, and to observe how the several Passions rise and fall, in quick Vicissitude. The Mind of Man cannot dwell for any considerable Time upon one Object; from whence it results, that, Love and Resentment, Grief and Joy, Despair and Hope, Rage and Tenderness, are perpetually taking their Turns in the Breast. To per∣ceive minutely the very Point where the first ceases, and the succeeding one begins to rise, requires a nice Dis∣cernment; as in the well wrought Piece of some emi∣nent Hand, the Colours run so artfully into one another, that their gradual Evanescence from the Sight, and their growing by insensible Degrees into a full Glow, is only to be discovered by the curious Eye. If I do not mistake, the Touch, which so skilfully blends different Colours in this delicate Confederacy, is called by the Painters the <HI>Demi-tint;</HI> should not something like this be preserved, in the Performances of a good Actor, in order to render each Transition graceful and natural, to melt the Audience by regular Essays into Tenderness, or induce any other Impression with Justness and Pro∣priety? Whatever Passion has at any Time taken Pos∣session of the Heart, must abate by Degrees, and the Traces of it must be almost effaced, before a contrary Affection can gain Admittance; and whoever is careful
<PB N="41" REF="44"/>to mark with Feeling, the Ebbing out of the one, and Flowing in of the other, will be always sure to have an irresistible Command over his Audience.</P>
<P>But the Matter does not rest here; the Performer, who is ambitious of distinguishing himself for masterly Touches in Scenes of Vehemence, will find another la∣tent Secret, in the intellectual System, which must ne∣ver escape his Notice. It must be remembered, that there are frequent Occasions, in which the Breast is distracted by two different Passions at once, both working the Heart-strings in one mixed Emotion. These com∣plicated Agitations of the Mind are often imperceptible to all but the skilful Observer; and, therefore, as the Actor's chief Difficulty lies in this Point, a feeling Expres∣sion of it will always be a Proof of his Excellence, and Strokes of this Nature, well executed, will impress on every Breast the liveliest Sensations.</P>
<P>It often happens in mere descriptive Poetry, that the Writer observing some surprizing Agreement between Things, which in their Natures seem totally inconsistent with each other, from thence takes occasion to re∣concile Contrarieties in such an agreeable Assemblage, that the tasteful Reader is entertained with a Picture, which at once amuses his Fancy and satisfies his Judg∣ment. <HI>Virgil</HI> has many delicate Touches of this Na∣ture, and <HI>Horace,</HI> who had Art enough for every poe∣tic Embellishment, has heightened his Odes with se∣veral Beauties of this Sort. In this Class of Elegan∣cies may be reckoned the following Passages;
<Q><L><HI>Urit grata Pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ervitas;—</HI></L>
<L><HI>Pignusque direptum lacertis</HI></L>
<L><HI>Aut Digito malè pertinaci.</HI></L>
<L><HI>—Tityosque vultu</HI></L>
<L><HI>Risit invito.—</HI></L></Q></P>
<P><HI>Milton</HI> also, who has every softer Delicacy in minute Descriptions, as well as every lofty Image in the sublime,
<PB N="42" REF="45"/>has inserted many beautiful Colourings of this Species in his <HI>Paradise Lost,</HI> and his <HI>grinned horrible a ghastly Smile,</HI> is an admirable Instance. Mr. <HI>Addison</HI> has given to Thoughts of this Nature the Title of <HI>thwarting Ideas;</HI> and he adds, that they are some of the finest Strokes in the whole Compass of Poetry. If I might be allowed to carry this Hint further, I should call all Strokes of this Kind, where the Mind is worked into a Ferment, by the Name of <HI>thwarting Passions;</HI> and I will venture to say, that they will be universally acknowledged much more beautiful than that mere Clash of Ideas, which the eminent Critic just mentioned has so much insided upon; because they not only surprize with a seeming Contrast, but also interest the Heart; which is the Perfection of Poetry. The <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> Poets, and indeed the fine Writers among the Moderns, are full of these pathetic Representations of human Nature; but among them all, I do not remember a finer In∣stance, than a Passage in Mr. <HI>Whitehead</HI>'s <HI>Roman Father,</HI> when that Hero is reflecting on the Combat, which is to decide the Fate of <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<Q><L><HI>—Had I a thousand Sons in such a Cause,</HI></L>
<L><HI>I could behold 'em bleeding at my Feet,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And thank the Gods with Tears.—</HI></L></Q>
<P>To express these complicated Sensations, where se∣veral Passions at once agitate the Soul, requires such a Command of Countenance and Voice, that it is cer∣tainly the greatest Perfection of an Actor, and with a Kind of magic Power it always leads us into the most pleasing Distress.</P>
<P>If the Bounds of my Paper would admit it, I should here indulge myself in examining our present Per∣formers, with Regard to the three Divisions of the Pas∣sions above established. To one, I should, perhaps, ascribe the Merit of expressing with proper Enforce∣ment
<PB N="43" REF="46"/>the Sentiments of haughty Anger and tyrannic Cruelty; in another I should chiefly admire the grace∣ful Transition from Rage to Tenderness, and probably I should not hesitate to say, of a third, that he is excellent in all Vicissitudes of the Mind, and that in mixed Sensa∣tions he penetrates to the very Soul of his Hearers; and, were I to add, that, in many Situations, I have expe∣rienced the same from Mrs. <HI>Cibber,</HI> it would be but barely doing her that Justice, which her excellent Art deserves.</P>
<P>From what has been premised, it will appear, that to express the Emotions of the human Heart is the chief Business of an Actor, and no Account is ever to be made of Figure, Voice, or any other external Circum∣stances, unless it be when they combine with the Per∣former's Feelings to make deeper Impressions on an Au∣dience. I have known an Actor lengthen out the Tone of his Voice, and if it sounded clearly, imagine his Business finely executed, when Nature and the Passions required that he should speak in another Key, and in broken, short, and vehement Accents. <HI>Quinctilian</HI> has a just Remark on this Head "as Poets," says he, <Q>profess to sing their Works, Verse should be repeated in a Manner somewhat elevated above common Dis∣course, with a Sweetness properly tempered by Dis∣cretion, and not thrilling into a wanton Luxuriance of Sound, as if the Throat had been gargled for the Purpose.</Q> I shall only add, a lively Imagination is the Talent, which an Actor should principally culti∣vate, as it is that, which excites those pathetic Feel∣ings, without which no Man will ever succeed on the Stage, and with which it is hardly possible totally to fail.</P>

<BIBL><HI>PERSEUS.</HI></BIBL></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">H</SEG>OW vain and fantastic are all human Pur∣suits? How unsettled and inconstant are our Tempers; one Day pining for the At∣tainment of some imaginary Good, and, the next, hating ourselves for all that Perplexity of Thought which our whimsical Desires occasioned in our Breasts? How often are the soberest Understandings disturb'd by Agitations of Spirit about Things in themselves of no Kind of Moment or Importance, and when once the Tumult has subsided, how contemptible do we appear to ourselves, for having been so weak as to yield to the Impression? Every Period of Life is marked with this Inconstancy; the Child has Perplexities which the Boy laughs at; and ripened by a further Accession of Years into Manhood, our previous Occupations become ri∣diculous, 'till at length old Age thinks the whole a
<PB N="46" REF="49"/>Series of Follies, insensible to its own Infirmities, and lit∣tle aware that the Passions operate at that Juncture with less Celerity, not because Reason is grown strong, but on Account of the enfeebled Tone of all the mental Powers; like a Weather Cock, which being grown rusty, is not moved with every Breath of Wind, but slowly veers from Point to Point. I am inclined to think that the human Soul will be always in this Progression, constantly making each Moment a Critic on the last, and and that as soon as the Spirit shall be unbodied, it will instantly smile at our wisest Employments in this World, our deepest Reflections, and our most serious Specu∣lations. I was engaged in this Train of Thought the other Night, and having an Imagination, which does not very soon detach itself from the Objects that have once possessed it, the same Scenes of Reflection dis∣closed themselves to me in Sleep, and formed a Pro∣spect, not unentertaining to my Fancy.</P>
<P>I thought the Hemisphere on a sudden brightened with more than common Lustre, a Flood of Glory diffusing itself through all Creation, and from an Opening of the Heavens appeared, high exalted on a Throne, THE GE∣NIUS OF HUMAN KIND. After a Trumpet had sounded three Times, the following Sounds were awfully pro∣nounced. <Q>Let all those fleeting Spirits, which for∣merly animated corporal Tenements, forthwith ap∣pear from their several Mansions of Retribution, and let those who now support a feverish Existence upon Earth, instantly repair hither, divested of their bodily Incumbrance, and account before our dread Presence, for the Use they have made of their Time, during their State of Probation.</Q></P>
<P>The Edict was immediately obeyed, and I fancied that I had no sooner emerged from my Tenement of Clay, than every Thing wore another Appearance, and new Faculties of Perception were assigned me. Vanished were the original Colours, concerning which
<PB N="47" REF="50"/>so many Volumes have been written; Wit, Taste, Learning, Philosophy, Mathematics, and even Money itself appeared an absolute Chimaera; and several Per∣sonages beginning to address the Throne, I was further confirm'd in my Opinion that all was Idleness, Vanity, and unavailing Vexation.</P>
<P><HI>Homer</HI> declared his whole Poem to be the Rhapsody of an ever-weening Imagination: He owned his ce∣lestial Councils and his Battle of the Gods, to be a Jumble of Absurdities; his boldest Flights of Fancy appeared quite contemptible, and he wondered how he could ever employ his Faculties in stringing together such wild enthusiastic Reveries.</P>
<P><HI>Plato</HI> owned that he knew nothing of the first <HI>Good,</HI> first <HI>Perfect,</HI> and first <HI>Fair;</HI> and Lord <HI>Shaftsbury</HI> wished that, instead of being guided by that Pagan Philosopher, he had made use of the Light of Revelation, which might have afforded him some faint dawning Ideas of that Truth of which he is now perfectly convinced. He added, that he did not know what he was about when he wrote his Rhapsody and many other Parts of his Performance, and that he now looked back at them with Contempt.</P>
<P><HI>Aristotle</HI> declared his System of Logic to be nothing but an idle Scheme of laboured Perplexities, calculated to puzzle and bewilder Mankind. <HI>Pindar</HI> smil'd at his Olympics, and did not hesitate to say, that he really believed he was mad when he wrote them; and old <HI>Euclid,</HI> who, I believe never once laughed on Earth, burst into a loud Expression of Mirth, when he re∣flected upon his Endeavours to square the Circle, and his several Triangles and Quadrangles, which he owned do not contribute in any Degree to the Advancement of Virtue.</P>
<P><HI>Alexander</HI> frankly confessed himself a Child for weep∣ing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> more Worlds. <HI>Caesar</HI> declared he would as contentedly be the last in a Village, as the first in <HI>Rome;</HI>
<PB N="48" REF="51"/>and <HI>Pompey</HI> had no longer an Aversion to an Equal; <HI>Cicero,</HI> without elaborating a Period of a Mile, con∣demned his Pursuit of Fame as no more than the cha∣sing an empty Bubble; and he added, that he never thought himself properly employed but when expatia∣ting against the minute Philosophers. <HI>Virgil</HI> still per∣sisted that his whole <HI>Aeneid</HI> should be burned. <HI>Horace</HI> and <HI>Ovid</HI> both laughed at the Duration of their Works which in their Days of Nature they flattered themselves would be indelible Monuments of their Fame.</P>
<P>In short, among all the celebrated Personages of Antiquity, every one accused himself of Misapplication, and even <HI>Titus</HI> complained that he had lost many Days.</P>
<P>There were those who acknowledged that they ne∣ver knew Uneasiness in Life, but what was occasioned by the Success of others, and that they were always completely happy, or completely miserable by Com∣parison. <HI>Poets</HI> laugh'd at all their Pains to tag a Rhyme and their Solicitude for Works which now appeared to them in a proper Light; and <HI>Criticks</HI> acknowledged that they took too much unnecessary Trouble to destroy Productions of so perishable a Nature. The Miser rail∣ed at <HI>insolvent Gold,</HI> as it is finely called by the witty Doctor <HI>Young,</HI> and his Heart expanded with Generosity and social Affection.</P>
<P>The softer Sex presented themselves among the Rest on this Occasion; but the Simper of Self-Admiration no longer displayed itself. They were not anxious a∣about the Gloss of their Skin, the Arrangement of a Curl, or the Disposition of a Patch. The snowy Breast ceased to heave with studied Carelessness, and the Shape was not tortured a thousand Ways, in order to look at∣tractive in the Eye of Man. The Labours of the Toilet were now despised, and each Fair-one wondered how Dress could make so great a Part of the Business of Life; and how they could ever take so much Pride in perish∣able Clay, however neatly moulded, and however tinc∣tured with a pleasing Hue. They were now per∣swaded
<PB N="49" REF="52"/>that true Beauty dwells in the Mind; Drums, Routs and Cards were held in Contempt, and as Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> has it, They viewed with Scorn two Pages and a Chair. They were all ashamed of the Falsehoold of their Friendships, their Tehees and Titters at a ruined Character, their several Turns of Coquetry, Dissimulation, and all the Variety of female Artifice. In short, Mankind in general owned themselves distract∣ed with Cares beneath a rational Creature; and Envy, Pride, Selfishness, Perfidy and Ambition swell'd the vast Account.</P>
<P>From these Disturbers of our Happiness I was re∣joyced to see my Fellow Creatures relieved; and to perceive Love, Joy, and Benevolence effacing gra∣dually all Traces of former Guilt, gave me an inex∣pressible Delight. But I soon found I was not in Reality launched into Eternity, and therefore my Joy, like all Things subject to Time and mortal Chance, soon came to an End. The Fumes of Sleep were dissipated, and I awaked from my Dream. Loose as it is, the Reader may derive this Moral from it, that there is nothing in human Life worth the Anxiety it creates, and that it should be our Business at pre∣sent to fix those Propensities and Habits in our Souls, which we shall not have Occasion hereafter to wish totally effaced, and which it is probable we shall be carrying to an higher Degree of Purity in those Man∣sions, which are prepared for our future Existence.</P>

<Q>— Pictis bellantur Amazones armis.
<BIBL><HI>VIRG.</HI></BIBL></Q>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> PAID a Visit, a few Days since, to a Lady, for whom I always entertained a very high Esteem, on Account of a pleasing Turn of Conversation, and many other good and agreeable Qualities, which she is possessed of.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Millefont</HI> (for that is her Name) was never known to have the least Propensity to Scandal or De∣traction: She does not concern herself with the imper∣tinent Knowledge of, who and who were together at the Masquerade, who were seen to interchange a few fond Regards at the Theatre, or who has lately had an
<PB N="51" REF="54"/>Ill run at Play. Politeness, Good-nature and Affability are her characteristic Perfections, and she is ready to allow Wit and Beauty in others, as well as in her own Daughters; though in my Opinion, it is a rare Thing to see them equalled by any of their Sex. Both the young Ladies are tall and graceful; elegant in Shape and delicate in their Features; extremely like each other in the Turn of the Face, and still each of them forming, if I may be allowed to use the Phrase, a different School of Beauty.</P>
<P><HI>Harriet,</HI> being two Years elder, is rather more formed and higher in Bloom than her Sister, but seems to be sensible of the approaching Eclipse which her Beauty must suffer very shortly, when all the Charms, which are at present budding forth in the Person of <HI>Charlot,</HI> have attained their full Perfection. Tho' <HI>Harriet</HI> is sensible of this, she yet perceives it without any Proneness to Envy. On the contrary she rallies herself with great Vivacity, and will fairly own that she is upon the Look∣out for a Man for herself, before <HI>Charlot</HI> becomes so mis∣chievous a Beauty, as to engross the Attention of every Beholder; and then, says she, <Q>I shall lose all my Ad∣mirers, and so I'm resolved to get married out of the Way.</Q></P>
<P>On this Account she at present throws the Dart like a Tyrant, as the Poet phrases it, though I am convinced when she resigns her Person, her good Sense will then lead her to imitate the Gentleness and amiable Disposition of <HI>Charlot</HI> who does not aim at being so fierce a Beauty as <HI>Harriet,</HI> but is chiefly desirous to be Mistress of wil∣ling Hearts. She does not endeavour to kindle her Eyes into that Glare of Fire, for which many others are re∣markable, but unambitiously she lets them shine in their own native Mildness; and if the captivates every Heart it is without any premeditated Design. In short, the Difference between these two young Ladies is this;
<PB N="52" REF="55"/><HI>Charlot</HI>'s Charms have a constant Emanation, and <HI>Harriet</HI>'s Beauties are in a perpetual Exertion.</P>
<P>I spent an Hour in the most agreeable Manner with this Family, when <HI>Harriet</HI> in her giddy Manner gave a new Turn to the Conversation by asking me, <Q>Pray, Mr. <HI>Ranger,</HI> can you tell me something about <HI>Mack∣lin</HI>'s new Scheme; pray what is the Man about?</Q> —To this I replied, that I really was not sufficiently in the Secret; that he has built two magnificent Rooms, and intends to furnish them in an elegant Manner; the Apartment on the Ground-Floor to be a public Cof∣fee-Room, and the other for the Reception of Gen∣tlemen of Rank and Education; but that, however, I was afraid he would share the common Fate of Pro∣jectors.</P>
<P><Q>Well, I vow and protest, says <HI>Harriet,</HI> it's a vexa∣tious Thing to see how these Men are always contri∣ving Places for their own Accommodation, without Troubling their Heads about the Women. The odious Things are always herding with one another, and the Ladies are sequestred from all the Joys of these convenient Meetings. Does not one hear them eternally saying with an Air of Indifference, Ma'am I must go the Coffee house, and so saunter away with that janty careless Air, that never fails to provoke me? — Well, I wish the Women would agree to have a Coffee-house of their own, to be revenged of the Fellows—Lord, Mr. <HI>Ranger,</HI> it would do charm∣ingly; don't you think so Sister?—It would so tan∣talize the Creatures, to see us going into a Place, where none of them can gain Admittance—they would be so proud to wait at the Door to hand us to our Chairs; and it would be such a Pleasure to go and meet one's Acquaintance without going con∣stantly in a stiff Dress to Routs and Drums; dear <HI>Ranger,</HI> you must give us an helping Hand; you must give us an Essay upon it, you wild Devil.</Q> With this she
<PB N="53" REF="56"/>tapped me on the Shoulder, in her lively agreeable Man∣ner, and insisted with all the Rhetoric of a Romp, that I should propose her Scheme to the Public, which I assured her I should take the first Opportunity to perform.</P>
<P>I have ever been of Opinion, that, in the general, Coffee-houses, are not of such Advantage as is gene∣rally imagined, most of these Places being frequented entirely by Bucks, Bloods, and Rakes, of all Denomi∣nations, from whom there is nothing to be acquired ex∣cept a Swagger in the Gait, a drunken Totter, a noisy riotous Deportment, a Volley of Oaths and a total Want of what is called Good Breeding. Perhaps this Opportunity of detaching themselves from the Ladies in Coffee-house Clubs is the Cause of that Aukward∣ness, which is frequently remarkable in Persons, who from their Fortunes and Situation in Life should be better accomplished, and on this Account I am ap∣prehensive, that a Rendezvous of this Nature might have some ill Effect upon the Deportment of the Fair; but should this Scheme be carried into Execution, I must acknowledge, that it will in many Respects set the Ladies upon a <HI>Par</HI> with the Men, and the Conve∣nience of meeting People of Fashion, without the ne∣cessary Parade of going to their Houses, will certainly be very great; also Appointments with each other may be fixed with Ease by the Means of this Institution; and a Memorandum Book, placed at the Bar, as at the <HI>Bedford</HI> and other Places, may serve for the following Purposes.</P>

<P>Such Proceedings as these will inevitably do Honour to the amiable Sex, and as they may judge it necessary to <HI>claim an equal Expire o'er the World,</HI> I beg Leave to offer them a few Rules, which may serve to conduct a female Coffee-house with proper Regularity.</P>

<P>BY Letters from a Correspondent abroad, we are in∣formed, that when Monsieur <HI>Voltaire</HI> was arrested by order of the King of <HI>Prussia;</HI> there were found, among his Papers, several Translations of different Pas∣sages in <HI>Shakespear,</HI> done so extremely ill, that it is conjectured, he purposely made use of a frigid Languor of Expression, in order to lessen the Poet's Reputation abroad, in hopes that then himself might be set down as the greatest dramatic Poet in the World. But to quiet this restless Ambition, we must inform him that <HI>Apollo</HI> has long since issued out his Prohibition, so that he may swell, like the Frog in the Fable, without ever coming near him. <HI>Non si te ruperis, inquit, par eris.</HI> The same Advices mention, that, there were also se∣veral abusive Paragraphs on the same immortal Bard, very improper from the Pen of a Scholar and a Gentle∣man. The following Libel was particularly remarkable. <HI>L'Action</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide</HI> the Letter prefixed to his Orphan of <HI>China.</HI></NOTE> <HI>de la piece Chinoise dure vingt-cinq ans, comme dans les farces monstreuses de Shakespear &amp; Lopez de Vega, qu'on a nomme tragedies.</HI> <Q>The Action of the <HI>Chinese</HI> Play includes five and twenty Years, as in the mon∣strous Farces of <HI>Shakespear,</HI> and <HI>Lopez de Vega,</HI> which have obtained the Name of Tragedies.</Q> Is it not invidious in Monsieur <HI>Voltaire</HI> to mention <HI>Lopez de Vega,</HI> in Conjunction with a Poet, whom, in his Soul, he can∣not but reverence as a Genius, superior to all the drama∣tic
<PB N="56" REF="59"/>Writers in the World, and of whom he has frequent∣ly availed himself? As Mr. <HI>Voltaire</HI> is so rigid a Critic we shall one Day hold an Enquiry into his poetical Merit, and therefore we think proper to publish the following</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T was the Answer of a certain eminent <HI>Jew,</HI> when asked by what Means he accu∣mulated the very large Fortune, which he is supposed to be possessed of, that he had more Difficulty in acquiring the first Three Thousand Pounds, than all the Rest of his immoderate Wealth. This Apothegm may be said to comprize the whole Arcanum of rising in the World, but as not one of the
<PB N="57" REF="60"/>Adepts in the Science has thought proper to discover the secret Art of putting this Rule in Practice, it is to be apprehended, the Indigent will find as many Diffi∣culties as ever to retard their Progress, and hinder them from emerging out of their Embarrassments. The Au∣thor of my Motto has observed, many Ages since, that the most exalted Virtues, and the rarest Accomplish∣ments do not find it easy to extricate themselves out of Difficulties; and the Course of human Contingencies has proved the Maxim true to this Day.</P>
<P>There is perhaps hardly any Man, but can point out in the Circle of his Acquaintance certain Personages of very extensive Capacities, strong and quick Parts, and a delicate Sense of Honour, who are not however able to raise themselves to any conspicuous Point of Emi∣nence, merely because their Talents have not been called forth by Opportunity, or animated by Success. Genius wherever it subsists, must be warmed and che∣rished, otherwise it is apt to languish and decay; the fine Sensations, which are attendant on an enlightened Understanding, occasion a certain Delicacy in the Pos∣sessor's Way of thinking, which renders him liable to a Dejection of Spirits upon many Occasions in Life. Refined Parts should be tenderly preserved, or they are liable to be chilled by the Blasts of Adversity; like those Fruits, which would wither unripened in our cold northern Clime, were they not carefully assisted in their Vegetation by the adventitious Use of hot Beds.</P>
<P>The Circumstance, which in my Opinion reflects the greatest Lustre upon the Character of Lord <HI>Sommers,</HI> is the Encouragement he afforded to such a Genius as Mr. <HI>Addison,</HI> who might have remained in a less con∣spicuous Point of View without the Assistance of such a Patron. His Vein of Humour, which is now the gen∣teelest in the World, might have taken a Tincture from low Life; his delicate Raillery might have sub∣sided into coarse and vulgar Railing; His Taste, which
<PB N="58" REF="61"/>was finished by Travel and every other Advantage, might have grown quite callous and indelicate: for his Sentiments of Morality might have been substituted a Strain of Ribaldry, to awaken the Blum of Confusion in that female Face, which, as Matters happened, he took so much Pains to set off in the Smiles of native Innocence and unaffected Beauty; and that Pen, which entertained the Town with some of the most elegant Productions of human Wit, might have been employed in Politics, personal Invective, and Party-rage. But the kindly Protection of the Lord <HI>Sommers</HI> hindered him from sinking into Obscurity, and from being compelled by Necessity to sully that fair Fame, which is now the Reward of his excellent Performances. The As∣sistance of so eminent a Person was a Kind of Demand upon him, for all that elaborate Elegance, which now distinguishes itself in his Writings.</P>
<Q><L>He from the Taste obscene refines our Youth,</L>
<L>And sets the Passions on the Side of Truth.</L>
<BIBL><HI>POPE.</HI></BIBL></Q>
<P>It has been the Fate of many, endowed perhaps with Parts not very inferior to <HI>Addison,</HI> to droop in Indi∣gence, their poetic Fires totally extinguished, and I make no Manner of Doubt, but in the present Age, there are those who might become shining Ornaments of the Republic of Letters, were there any Incitement to spur the Muses Steed. But a Treatise on <HI>Cribbidge,</HI> or a Calculation of the Chances at Whist, is sure of being better received at present, than the Odes of a <HI>Collins,</HI> or any Performance of distinguished Genius. While a <HI>Smart</HI> subsists among us, I cannot help thinking it an indelible Reproach to the Age, that he has not any where sound a <HI>Mecaenas,</HI> and that he is suffered to draw his Pen in the Praises of his Maker, without receiving any other Reward, than a small Premium at <HI>Cambridge,</HI> and that Portion of Fame, which, in Spight of Malice and Envy, he will be always sure to enjoy.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="62"/>Wit is generally considered as an Object of Ridicule rather than an Accomplishment deserving Encourage∣ment and Esteem, and the Narrowness of Fortune, in which most of the literary Tribe are situated, is a standing Topic of Pleasantry, and to call a Man a Poet, is, in most Companies, a stroke of irresistible Hu∣mour. The witty Doctor <HI>Young</HI> has ridiculed this with his usual Delicacy.</P>
<Q><L><HI>These, when their utmost Venom they would spit,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Most barbarously tell you</HI>—"he's a Wit."</L>
<L><HI>Poor Negrces thus to shew their burning Spite,</HI></L>
<L><HI>To Cacodaemons say, they're</HI> Dev'lish White.</L></Q>
<P>There is hardly any Thing more affecting to a Man of real Merit, than to find himself scorned by the Inso∣lence of Purse-pride. People of Affluence should con∣sider when they attempt to depreciate Men of su∣perior Parts, that they betray an unmanly Triumph over those, who have still their Fortune to make. But, as Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> finely observes, the World in general is apt to form an Idea of a Man, at the Time he is least able to make a proper Judgment for himself; and from thence it results, that we find many utterly ruined by slight Errors, trivial Indiscretions, and petty Inadver∣tencies, while others owe their Elevation to Vices, to headstrong Passions, and a Series of selfish Views, which are, for the greater Part, more successful, than Modesty, a sober Understanding, and a Spirit above abject Flat∣tery and mean Submission.</P>
<P>They who sit smiling at the Goal of Fortune, while others are running the hardy Course, should reflect, that it is possible for Perseverance and unremitted Ap∣plication, to reach the very Point, in which they take so much Pride; and then it is evident on which Side the Superiority will be found. A well turned Spirit, with the Advantages of a genteel Education and a compe∣tent Knowledge of the World, must certainly receive
<PB N="60" REF="63"/>additional Lustre from an Accession of Wealth, and the Accomplishments of such a one, will, in their Turn, adorn and embellish Affluence. On this Account, <HI>Ju∣venal</HI>'s Maxim is without Dispute, highly just; a great Respect, says he, is due to Youth. The Practice of this Observation I would recommend to all Parents, Uncles, Guardians, and all Ranks of People, who have any Concern in the Education of the rising Generation; as it is to be apprehended that they frequently, by too much Precipitance in their Conduct, drive them to Ex∣tremes, which a little Indulgence might prevent, and by which they might become valuable Members of Society.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HERE is not, in my Opinion, a more exquisite Pleasure in the Power of Man, than what arises from an internal View of his own mental Constitution. To observe the various Association of Ideas, combined with a Ra∣pidity, which scarcely leaves a Trace behind it, to watch the subtile Movements of the Passions, and thence to deduce the secret Source of many of our Sen∣sations, which are in Appearance extremely compli∣cated and surprizing, is a Task requiring the finest Per∣ception in the Research, and also productive of the most useful Knowledge we can boast, and the highest Delight our Faculties are susceptible of.</P>
<P>The Solution of a mathematical Problem may be agreeable to that Curiosity, which is implanted in us.;
<PB N="62" REF="65"/>and the <HI>Newtonian Philosophy</HI> may expand the Imagina∣tion with stupendous Ideas of the Distances of heavenly Bodies; but in these Occupations, like <HI>Swift</HI>'s Taylor, it is possible, we may mistake one Figure, and then all our ingenious Labour evaporates into Air; whereas in the Pursuit of Self-knowledge our Reasonings are from Feeling, and all our Discoveries, besides the Ad∣vantage of being as surprizing as in any other Science, carry with them a further Accession of Pleasure, as we are ourselves more immediately concerned in them. In travelling through an open champain Country the Prospect on every Side may administer to the Pleasures of Imagination; but a Man will certainly feel more lively Sensat ons when riding upon Land belonging to himself; the Landskip of his own Estate will look more beautiful to the Eye, the Lawn shall spread a more pleasing Verdure, and the Discovery of a Mine, or the secret Spring of a little Rill running through his Mea∣dows, aford him a Delight not to be equalled by the gayest Scenes that can be presented to him.</P>
<P>The Study of the human Mind is, therefore, the most rational and pleasing Employment we are capable of; for my Part I am always highly delighted when any accidental Circumstance throws me into this Tract of thinking, and whether reading <HI>Rabelais</HI>'s frolic Rav∣ings, or the sublime Enthusiasm of <HI>Homer,</HI> I am sure ever and anon to lay aside the Volume, in order to trace the Pleasure, which I have received, to its hid∣den Source, and to account for the Appearance upon some Principle in our Constitution. An Opportunity of gratifying this Turn occurred to me the other Day, when casually turning over some of the most beautiful Passages in epic Poetry, I could not help taking notice, that I perused the Description of Thousands stretched upon the Field of Battle, weltring in Blood, agonizing with their Wounds, and trampled under Horses Hoofs, without feeling any of those Propensities to Compas∣sion,
<PB N="63" REF="66"/>which were frequently awakened in me by the Death of a single Person. I could read with the greatest Composure and Serenity, Lines, which mention dying Groans of Numbers falling in one promiscuous Carnage, broken Limbs of Warriors, Men and Horses, all mixed in one general Scene of Destruction.</P>
<Q><L><HI>Tum vero gemitus morientum, &amp; sanguine in alto</HI></L>
<L><HI>Armaque Corporaque &amp; permisti caede Virorum</HI></L>
<L><HI>Semianimes volvuntur Equi—</HI></L></Q>
<P>A Muster-Roll of Heroes, who in one Line em∣braced their Fate, did not move me to the least ténder Sensation.</P>
<Q><L><HI>Chloreaque, Sybarimque, Daretaque, Thersilocumque.</HI></L>
<L><HI>Alcandrumque, Haliumque, Noëmonaque, Prytanimque.</HI></L></Q>
<P>The Mind is totally impassive in all these general Ac∣counts of the Calamities of War; but, when the Poet thinks proper to distinguish a single Person from the Throng, we melt in Pity of his Fate, heedless of the general Devastation, which is spread around him. That this is the Case every Body that has read the <HI>Aeneid</HI> will be ready to acknowledge; and yet it might be imagined that our Hearts should be more intensely agitated, when Desolation sweeps whole Ranks of our Fellow-Creatures from the Face of the Earth, than when we read the Fate of an Individual; but such is our Dis∣position, that we can go through all these Narratives without Emotion, and when the epic Writer throws out but a short Reflection upon the Fall of one Man, we are instantly fixed in Attention, and our Hearts throb with Compassion for his untimely End.</P>
<P>The Reason of this I take to be, that in the former Case, we are only told, that so many embraced their Fate in Battle, in which Circumstance there is nothing to excite Commiseration in a reasonable Being. Death is one of the Conditions of human Life, and we all
<PB N="64" REF="67"/>hold our Existence in this World upon the same preca∣rious Tenure. We therefore consider the Descriptions of <HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Virgil</HI> as no more than a mere Bill of Mortality, and when they inform us that such a Num∣ber perished upon the Spot, we peruse it with as much Calmness as the Paragraph which tells us, <Q>Encreased in the Burials this Week five hundred.</Q> And further, when they tell us, that, one receives an Arrow in the jugular Vein; another has a Spear run through his Shoulder, and is rivetted with his Body double to the Ground; a third is wounded in the Mouth and has his Head split in two, it may serve, as the Critics observe, to give Variety to the Battle, but in Fact, amounts to no more than what we read in a common News paper, <Q>Yesterday a Labourer fell from the Top of an House, by which Accident he broke his Collar bone and in∣stantly expired.</Q> An Account of bodily Pain has but a very slight Influence upon our Passions; it is men∣tal Distress that principally operates upon our Hearts, and our Pity rises in Proportion to the Agitations of Mind, which we perceive in the Person afflicted. Be∣sides this, the Poet frequently finds collateral Avenues to our Souls, by a Mention of Family-Connections, and to heighten our Sorrow, he addresses himself to the moral Sense of his Reader, and interests him still more in the Fate of his Hero, by representing his amiable Qualities, and the elegant Accomplishments, which would have rendered him a deserving Member of So∣ciety. By these Mears our tenderest Feelings are awakened, and the Effect is not unlike what a Man may experience in a Church-yard, where he sees a Multitude of different Graves in which, the good, the bad, the old and young lie in promiscuous Silence, and he therefore beholds the Scene without Emotion; but as soon as the Tomb stone presents a Character of one distinguished from the Rest, he then laments the generous Friend, the tender Husband, the indulgent
<PB N="65" REF="68"/>Father, and mourns for him who acted agreeably to the Relations in which he stood to his Fellow Crea∣tures. Thus when we read of a dying Person, that he was a Friend of the Muses, and that Harmony was the Delight of his Soul, we consider him in a different Light from those, who as Mr. <HI>Addison</HI> expresses it, are celebrated for nothing but being knocked in the Head.
<Q><L><HI>—Amicum Cretea Musis,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Cretea Musarum Comitem, cui Carmina semper</HI></L>
<L><HI>Et Citharae Cordi, numerosque intendere Nervis.</HI></L></Q> When we are told of another, that his Death was la∣mented by his Friends in sundry Parts of his Country, we cannot help joining in the general Grief.
<Q><L><HI>Te Nemus Agnitiae, vitreâ te Fucinus undâ,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Te liquidi flevere Lacus.—</HI></L></Q> The Number of Sufferers is encreased, and our Pas∣sions encrease in Proportion to the Knowledge conveyed to us of their Affections, their tender Friendships, and their Schemes for future Happiness. One falls in the Midst of his half-finished Projects; him his blooming Mistress mourns with frantic Sorrow, and all his Re∣lations bewail his Loss. Another receives his mortal Wound through the very Garment which his Mother worked for him with her own Hands.
<Q><L><HI>Trarsiit &amp; Parmam Mucro, levia Arma minacis,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Et Tunicam, molli mater quam neveral Auro,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Implevitque sinum sanguis—</HI></L></Q> Besides these little Touches which the epic Writer oc∣casionally makes use of to awaken and engage the Pas∣sions, they are further obliged to diversify their Battles with Episodes, or short Accounts of particular Adven∣tures, in order to secure our Attention, and relieve us from that general Scene of Slaughter, which, they are conscious we peruse without any of those Sensations, which it is the primary Excellence of Poetry to excite.
<PB N="66" REF="69"/>Thus the Story of <HI>Nisus</HI> and <HI>Euryalus</HI> will always soften the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eader into Compassion, when other Passages, in one Line of which there is infinitely more Mischief done, will be passed over with Indifference. I should not think the worse of him that should calmly go thro' most of the Battles in epic Poetry, but I hope there is not one of my Readers who would not yield to the ten∣derest Impressions at the Fall of <HI>Pallas,</HI> and the Lamen∣tation of <HI>Aeneas</HI> over his dead Body.</P>
<P>The Use I would make of what has been premised is, that, as our Passion are worked up in Proportion to the many amiable Qualities of the Character in Distress, and the Keeness of mental Sensation, which we sup∣pose it suffers, our modern Writers of Tragedy should attach themselves to this Circumstance, and consider that it is not the theatrical Apparatus, the Bowl, the Dagger, the Dungeon or the Clink of Chains, that can affect an Audience, but a faithful Portrait of a Mind struggling with various Sensations. If the Players would also consider the same, Noise and Rant would be effectually banished, and instead of aiming at Applause by the mere Effect of own sonorous Voices, they would endeavour by every Look, every Tone, and every At∣titude to mark the in-felt Anguish of their Minds.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">M</SEG>Y Readers will observe, that I frequently select Mottos, for my Papers, from the Author, whose Name I have prefixed to this Day's Essay; the Reason of it is, his Sense is so refined, and the Turn of his Expres∣sion so peculiarly delicate, that his Remarks are inter∣mixed with my own ordinary Ideas, in such a Manner, that they recur to me, upon almost every Occasion. <HI>Horace</HI> is so sensibly and elegantly sententious, not only in his Epistles and Satires, which are professedly moral Discourses, but also in his lighter Odes, and his gayest Excursions of Fancy, that I have often thought, an ex∣cellent System of Morality, might be extracted out of his. Writings; I have even carried this Hint so far, as to think seriously of publishing a Translation of all his excellent ethic Observations, which would, in my Opinion, be the best Collection of Thoughts on various Subjects, that has ever been offered to the Public.</P>
<P>The Passage, which I have placed at the Head of this Paper contains a very beautiful Moral. <Q>Who is there,</Q> says the Bard, <Q>that can desire an Acces∣sion of false Honour, who is not sensible of some in∣herent Defect? and who can be alarmed at the Blasts of Calumny and Detraction, who bears in his own Heart a Regard to Truth?</Q>—This Sentence con∣tains
<PB N="69" REF="72"/>such indelible Marks of a virtuous Disposition, that it should be written in Letters of Gold, and im∣pressed in deep Characters on the Heart of every Man, who would pass through Life with an honest and fair Fame, as it suggests a just Contempt for all ill-grounded Applause, and furnishes the Man of upright Heart with the proper Weapons of a noble Disregard for the mean Designs of Slander and Malevolence.</P>
<P>Hypocrisy is considered, by all Moralists, as the most despicable and infamous Disease of the Soul; it discovers a Sense of the Grace and Beauty of a fair Character, but generally carries with it a total Absence of all good Qualities. It aims at Esteem, by artfully concealing the latent Imperfections, and exhibiting to the public Eye a glossy Appearance of something amiable and honest. But unless the Mind is thoroughly weeded, in spight of every artful Disguise, the lurk∣ing Mischief will, one Time or other, break out, and as <HI>Perseus</HI> expresses it, like a wild <HI>Fig-tree,</HI> force its Way through the very Liver;
<Q><L><HI>— Quae semel intus</HI></L>
<L><HI>Ianata est, rupto jecore exierit</HI> Caprificus.</L></Q> Since I have mentioned this Satirist, it coincides with my present Scope, to observe, that there is not in any Author ancient or modern, a nobler Description of a Man of real Honour, than what is found in two Lines of his Writing; I shall transcribe his Words, because the Passage is highly beautiful, and for the Sake of the mere <HI>English</HI> Reader, I shall add Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI>'s excel∣lent Translation.</P>
<Q><L><HI>Compositum jus fasque Animi, sanctosque Recessus</HI></L>
<L><HI>Mentis, &amp; incocium generoso Poetus honesto.</HI></L>
<L><HI>A Soul, where Laws both human and divine</HI></L>
<L><HI>In Practice more than Speculation shine;</HI></L>
<L><HI>A genuine Honour, of a vigorous Kind,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Pure in the last Recesses of the Mind.</HI></L></Q>
<P><PB N="70" REF="73"/>Certain it is, that for the Formation of a just Cha∣racter, it is requisite to have a perfect Knowledge of Right and Wrong settled in the Mind, Virtue should be ledged in the Soul, and the Heart should glow with generous Truth; but as the World now goes, there is more Art to acquire the popular Opinion than Merit to deserve it; and the general Method, by which People grasp at Fame, consists in depreciating some Neighbour's Character. Thus the female Beauty aims at being a general Toast, by detracting from some other Fair-one. The Merchant endeavours to extend his own Credit and Correspondence by an artful Pro∣pagation of Suspicions to another's Disadvantage, and the Quack, after setting forth the unerring Efficacy of his Nostrum, closes his Advertisement with, <Q>Beware of Counterfeits, for such are abroad.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Cicero</HI> observes, that for one Man to detract from another, and to think of aggrandizing himself at the Expence of his Neighbour, is more against Nature, than Death, than Grief, or any other Calamity incident to human Life. The Realms of Fame are not to be explored by <HI>Doublings</HI> and <HI>Shiftings,</HI> and, whenever any one would arrive at those Regions, Honour, Truth, and Generosity must freight the Vessel; the Breath of vo∣luntary, impartial Applause must swell the Sail, and the Course must be direct, bold, and open to the Eye of the World.</P>
<P>A Reputation otherwise obtained must certainly af∣ford very little Satisfaction, and it will still administer less, when we consider, that it is only, as <HI>Shakespear</HI> calls it, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> HONOUR, gained from the ignorant, from the self <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>rested, the mean, and the contemp∣tible,; <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>word sua munera c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rd<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> says a Writer already quoted; let the Underlings of Mankind keep their Commendations to themselves; for the Praise of such is beneath the Ambition of an honest Man, and by Parity of Reason, their Censure, their Disapprobation,
<PB N="71" REF="74"/>their Cabals, their Intrigues, their Tattles, their daily Compotations, and their Midnight Clubs, are to be despised by every one, whose Breast is impregnated with a Love of Truth and Virtue.</P>
<P>To draw to a Conclusion; the uncertain Tide of illu∣sive Popularity is ever known to fluctuate, to ebb, and to subside, and then the <HI>Shallows</HI> are discovered, the <HI>treacherous Quicksands</HI> are revealed, and the <HI>Bottom</HI> lies betrayed to Sight. In like Manner giddy Detraction spends and exhausts itself; the Storm howls for a Time, and then decays into the Murmur of Obloquy, which at Length dies totally away; the Scene clears up▪ the Lustre of Integrity spreads a Day around it, and In∣famy, instead of adhering where it was directed, returns to its native Spring.</P>
<P>I have met in some <HI>French</HI> Writer a short <HI>Chinese</HI> Story, with which I shall dismiss this Paper. <Q>The celebrated <HI>Ming</HI> was accused of entertaining disre∣spectful Ideas of <HI>Tien</HI> and <HI>Li,</HI> and of being dissaffected to the Emperor <HI>Vang.</HI> When the Executioners went to seize the old Man, they found him composing a Panegyric upon <HI>Vang,</HI> and an Hymn to <HI>Tien</HI> and <HI>Li.</HI></Q>—</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>T the last Meeting of our Club, my Friend, Mr. <HI>Candid,</HI> informed us, that he had lately seen the Character of King <HI>Lear</HI> admirably performed by Mr. <HI>Garrick,</HI> and that he had since thrown together some Remarks upon that excel∣lent Tragedy, which he desired I would this Day com∣municate to the Readers of the <HI>Gray</HI>'s-<HI>Inn-Journal.</HI></P>
<P>To be able to criticise a Poet with any Degree of Perspicuity, it is requisite to consider the Nature of his Fable; and the moral Use of the Work. This being sketched, we may then proceed to observe how he lays on his Colouring, the Disposition of each Person∣age, the Expression of the Passions, and which is the capital Figure in the Piece. <HI>Lear</HI> being examined in this Manner, it will appear that the Author intended to exhibit, in the most striking Colours, the horrid Crime of Filial Ingratitude. To enforce this he represents an old Monarch tired with the Cares of State, and wil∣ling to distribute his Possessions among his Daughters, in Proportion to their Affections towards his Person. Accordingly, the two that flatter him obtain all, the third Sister being disinherited for her Sincerity, and the King is at length driven by the Ingratitude of his two eldest Daughters, to an extreme of Madness, which produces the finest Tragic Distress ever seen on any Stage.</P>
<P>As this is the Ground-work of the Play, I am sur∣prized that any Critic should impute the Madness of <HI>Lear</HI> to the Loss of Royalty. The Behaviour of his
<PB N="74" REF="77"/>Children is always uppermost in his Thoughts, and we perceive it working upon his Passions, till at Length his Mind settles into a fixed Attention to that single Ob∣ject. This, I think, will appear in a critical Exami∣nation of the Play.</P>
<P><HI>Lear,</HI> in his first Scene, shews himself susceptible of the most violent Emotions. The Poet has drawn him impetuous to the greatest Degree, proud, haughty, re∣vengeful, and tender-hearted. In such a Mind it is not to be wondered that Ill-treatment should excite the most uneasy Sensations. He takes fire at an imaginary Ap∣pearance of Disaffection in <HI>Cordelia.</HI></P>
<Q><L><HI>But goes thy Heart with this?</HI></L>
<L><HI>So young and so untender!</HI></L></Q>
<P>He is soon after alarmed with Suspicions of Disre∣spect from <HI>Gonerill,</HI> "I will look further into't."—He then is convinced of her contemptuous Disregard, and the Effect it has upon him, indicates a Mind, impotent and liable to the worst Perturbations.
<Q><L><HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/></HI> Lear <HI>walk thus? speak thus? where are his Eyes?</HI></L>
<L><HI>Either his Notion weakens, his Discernings</HI></L>
<L><HI>Are lethargy'd.—</HI></L></Q> His Reflections after this shew what is nearest to his Heart.</P>
<Q><L><HI>Ingratitude! thou marble-hearted Fiend,</HI></L>
<L><HI>More Lideous, when thou shew'st thee in a Child,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Than the Sea-Monster.—</HI></L></Q>
<P>He observes that <HI>Cordelia</HI>'s Fault was small; and when even that made such an Impression on him, what are we to expect from his fiery Disposition, when rejected by those to whom he had given all? His Imprecation, though big with Horror, is the natural Result of his Indignation; and the Tenderness and Overflowings of Softness, which melt him in the midst of his Vehe∣mence, produce a fine Conflict of Passions.
<PB N="75" REF="78"/>
<Q><L><HI>Th'untented Woundings of a Father's Curse,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Pierce ev'ry Sense about thee!—Old fond Eyes,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Reweep this Cause again, I'll pluck ye out,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And cast ye, with the Waters that you lose,</HI></L>
<L><HI>To temper Clay.—</HI></L></Q> His Haughtiness then breaks out in a Menace to his Daughter.
<Q><L><HI>Thou shal't find</HI></L>
<L><HI>That I'll resume the Shape, which thou dost think</HI></L>
<L><HI>I have cast off forever.</HI></L></Q> His Address to <HI>Regan</HI> is extremely tender and pathetic.
<Q><L><HI>Thy tender-hested Nature shall not give</HI></L>
<L><HI>Thee o'er to Harshness.</HI></L></Q> And a little after
<Q><L><HI>Thou better know'st</HI></L>
<L><HI>The Offices of Nature, Bond of Childhood,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Effects of Courtesie, Dues of Gratitude;</HI></L>
<L><HI>Thy half o'th' Kingdom thou hast not forgot,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Wherein I thee endow'd—</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>There have been many Poets who were acquainted in general with the Passions of human Nature, and ac∣cordingly we find them constantly describing their Ef∣fects; but <HI>Shakespear</HI>'s Art shows their Impulse and their Workings, without the Aid of Definition or flowery De∣scription. Besides the general Survey of the Heart, he was more intimately versed in the various Tempers of Mankind than any Poet whatever. We always find that he makes the Passions of each Personage in his Drama operate according to his peculiar Habit and Frame of Mind; and, in the Tragedy in Question, there are so many Strokes of this Nature, that in my Opinion, it is his Master-Piece. In every Speech in <HI>Lear</HI>'s Mouth, there is such an artful Mixture of thwarting Passions, that the Heart-strings of an Audience are torn on every
<PB N="76" REF="79"/>Side. The frequent Transition and Shifting of Emo∣tions is natural to every Breast, but in <HI>Lear</HI> they are cha∣racteristical Marks of his Temper.</P>
<Q><L><HI>I pr'ythee, Daughter, do not make me mad.</HI></L>
<L><HI>I will not trouble thee my Child. Farewel.</HI></L>
<L><HI>We'll meet no more—no more see one another.</HI></L>
<L><HI>But yet thou art my Flesh, my Blood, my Daughter;</HI></L>
<L><HI>Or rather a Disease that's in my Flesh,</HI> &amp;c.</L>
<L><HI>But I'll not chide thee;</HI></L>
<L><HI>Let Shame come when it will, I do not call it;</HI></L>
<L><HI>I do not bid the Thunder bearer shoot,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Nor tell Tales of thee to high judging</HI> Jove.</L></Q>
<P>In this Speech every Master-passion in his Temper rises in Conflict, his Pride, his Revenge, his quick Re∣sentment, and his Tenderness. <HI>Shakespear</HI> has beauti∣fully repeated Instances of this Nature, in almost every Line, and the following Passage has some of the finest Turns in the World.</P>
<Q><L><HI>O let not Woman's Weapons, Water-Drops,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Stain my Man's Cheeks—no, ye unnatr'al Hags—</HI></L>
<L><HI>I will have such Revenges on ye both—I'll do such Things,</HI></L>
<L><HI>What they are I know not—But they shall be</HI></L>
<L><HI>The Terrors of the Earth—you think I'll weep—</HI></L>
<L><HI>No—I'll not weep—I have full Cause of weeping—</HI></L>
<L><HI>This Heart shall break into a thousand Flaws—</HI></L>
<L><HI>Or e'er I'll weep—O Fool, I shall go mad.</HI></L></Q>
<P>Here the distressed Monarch leaves his Daughter's Roof, and the next Time we see him, he is on a wild Heath in a violent Storm, where all his Reflections take a Tincture from the gloomy Colour of a Mind diseased with Anguish, and we soon see what is the principal Object of his Attention.
<PB N="77" REF="80"/>
<Q><L><HI>— Thou all-shaking Thunder</HI></L>
<L><HI>Crack Nature's Mould; all Germins spill at once</HI></L>
<L><HI>That make</HI> UNGRATEFUL MAN.</L></Q> And again;
<Q><L><HI>The Tempest in my Mind</HI></L>
<L><HI>Doth from my Senses take all Feeling else</HI></L>
<L><HI>Save what beats there—Filial Ingratitude!</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>His sudden Apostrophe to his Daughters must draw Tears from every Eye.
<Q><L>O Regan! Gonerill!</L>
<L><HI>Your old kind Father, whose frank Heart gave all.</HI></L></Q> The breaking off has a fine Effect.</P>
<Q><L><HI>O! that Way Madness lies—let me shun that—</HI></L>
<L><HI>No more of that—</HI></L></Q>
<P>As yet the Perturbation of his Mind does not seem fixed to a Point; he begins to moralize, but still with a View to his own Afflictions, until <HI>Edgar</HI> enters dis∣guised like a Madman. <HI>Lear</HI>'s first Question is, <Q>have his Daughters brought him to this Pass? couldst thou save nothing? didst thou give them all?</Q>—And this I take to be the first Touch of fixed Madness in the Play, and might point out to any Man the Cause of his Destraction, without thinking of the Resignation of his Sceptre, or the mere Loss of regal Power.</P>
<P>As our Hero is now out of his Senses, a new Field opens itself to the Poet. He had before display'd every Movement of the Heart, and the human Understanding now becomes his Province, in which, we shall find, he acquits himself with the most masterly Skill. Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> observes, that <HI>Madmen do not seem to have lost the Faculty of Reasoning; but having joined together some Ideas very wrongly, they mistake them for Truths; and they err as Men do that argue right from wrong Principles. For by the Vio∣lence of their Imaginations, having mistaken their Fancies for Realities, they make right Deductions from them.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="81"/>Agreeably to this Account, <HI>Lear,</HI> upon the Appear∣ance of a Madman, takes it for granted that it is owing to his Daughters ill-treatment, and when contradicted, he replies, <Q>Death! Traitor! nothing could have sub∣dued Nature to such a Lowness but his unkind Daugh∣ters</Q>—He next takes him for a Philosopher, and agreeably to that Notion enquires <Q>what is the Cause of Thunder?</Q></P>
<P>In his next Scene a Desire of revenging his Grievances actuates his Mind;
<Q><L><HI>To have a thousand with red burning Spits</HI></L>
<L><HI>Come hizzing in upon 'em!</HI></L></Q> He then proceeds to arraign his Daughters in a Court of Justice. <Q>Arraign her first, 'tis <HI>Gonerill.</HI> I here take Oath before this honourable Assembly—she kicked the poor King her Father—Here is another too whose warpt Looks proclaim what Store her Heart is made of.</Q>—He still continues to dwell in Imagination upon the Crime of Ingratitude, which appears to him so shocking that he exclaims, <Q>Let them anatomize <HI>Regan;</HI>—see what breeds about her Heart—Is there any Cause in Nature for these hard Hearts?</Q> This last Stroke cannot fail to draw Tears from every Eye. The Reader will please to ob∣serve, that all this Time there is not a Word said of his Royalty, on the contrary, he says to <HI>Edgar,</HI> <Q>You, Sir, I entertain for one of my Hundred; only I do not like the Fashion of your Garment,</Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which hundred, was appointed after his Abdication.</P>
<P>After this how was <HI>Shakespear</HI> to represent <HI>Lear</HI> again so as to keep up the Passions, and heighten the Distress? By taking Advantage of every Circumstance in <HI>Lear</HI>'s Temper. He had said that he would reassume the Shape, he had cast off: This then remained untouched, and accordingly in the next Scene we perceive him ac∣tually putting it in Execution, and his Fancy suggests to him, that he is a King; from which he reasons as
<PB N="79" REF="82"/>from every other Principle, and always with an Eye to his Children. "No," they cannot touch me for "coining; I am the King himself." <Q>There's my Gauntlet—I'll prove it on a Giant.</Q> From this, his Imagination wanders. <Q>Bring up the brown Bills— O well flown Barb! i'th' Clout! i'th' Clout— Hewgh, give the Word.</Q>—From this Rambling he soon returns, and the habitual Ideas again take Pos∣session of him. <Q>Ha <HI>Regan! Gonerill!</HI> they flattered me like a Dog,</Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> After this, <HI>Glo'ster</HI> enquiring if it is not the King, he catches at the Word and answers, "Ay, every Inch a King." And then he draws some more Inferences from that Notion, till he reflects that <HI>Glo'ster</HI>'s Bastard Son was kinder to his Fa∣ther than his own Daughters, got in lawful Sheets. From this he digresses into an Invective against Wo∣men, and continues raving, till at length his Spirit of Revenge returns upon him. <Q>And when I've stolen upon these SONS-IN-LAW, then kill, kill, kill, kill.</Q></P>
<P>It was <HI>Shakespear</HI>'s Art to reserve his being crowned with Straw for the last Scene of his Madness, as it is a Representation of human Nature reduced to the lowest Ebb. Had he lost his Reason on Account of his abdicated Throne, the Emotions of Pity would not be so intense, as they now are when we see him drove to that Extreme by the Cruelty of his own Children. Every Topic of parental Distress being exhausted, and all the King's Master-Passions displayed in his Mad∣ness, the Poet judiciously shews him gradually coming to himself in the next Scene; and we see the Ideas dawning slowly on his Soul.
<Q><HI>Where have I been?—where am I?—fair Day-light!</HI></Q> In this Recollection of his Reason, he never once men∣tions the Loss of Royalty, but again touches upon the Cause of his Distress in his Speech to <HI>Cordelia.</HI>
<PB N="80" REF="83"/>
<Q><L><HI>I know you do not love me; for your Sisters</HI></L>
<L><HI>Have, as I do remember, done me wrong;</HI></L>
<L><HI>You have some Cause; they have not.—</HI></L></Q> So that before his Madness, in it, and after it, <HI>Lear</HI> never loses Sight of the Ideas which had worn such Traces on his Brain; and he must be unfeeling to the great Art of our Poet, who can look for any other Cause of Distress, in Scenes which are drawn so forcibly and strong, and kept up with the most exquisite Skill to the very dying Words of the unhappy Monarch.</P>

<LETTER>
<HEAD><HI>To</HI> CHARLES RANGER, <HI><ABBR>Esq</ABBR></HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>TO address a Letter to you under the Character of of Mr. <HI>Ranger,</HI> I am persuaded needs little Apo∣logy; especially when it goes from one, who, though a Stranger to you, has a real Regard to your Reputation as an Author, and having often received great Pleasure from your Weekly Essays, takes this Liberty of throw∣ing out his Thoughts to you on a Piece of Criticism in which he differs with you is Opinion.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="86"/>Your Paper of last <HI>Saturday</HI> an Examen of King <HI>Lear,</HI> and you think many Critics have mistaken the principal Idea in the old King's Mind during his State of Madness: After citing <HI>Lear's</HI> Exclamation on the Ingratitude of his Daughters you add, <Q>This might lead any Man to the Cause of <HI>Lear</HI>'s Madness, without thinking of the Resignation of his Sceptre.</Q> But certainly, whoever considers <HI>Lear</HI>'s Character with Attention, will from the very Passage you quote, beside an hundred others, think there is much to be said on the other Side of the Question.</P>
<P>I have read with great Pleasure several of the Remarks you make on the Speeches in <HI>Lear,</HI> which are such as can arise only in the Mind of a Reader of Taste; but I cannot agree, that <Q><HI>He must be unfeeling to the great Art of our Poet, who can look for any other Cause of Distress,</HI></Q> in the Madness of the King, than the In∣gratitude of his Daughters.</P>
<P>I know not in what Manner you may treat the Re∣marks I am about to make, but I can sincerely assure you, they are only intended as Hints to yourself, on a Subject which I think of some Consequence to the Ad∣mirers of <HI>Shakespear.</HI></P>
<P>The Critic in the <HI>Adventurer</HI> was somewhat wanting in Justice to the Poet, by mentioning the Loss of Royal∣ty as the sole Cause of <HI>Lear</HI>'s Madness, without taking Notice at the same Time of the forcible Idea he must have of the Ingratitude of his two Daughters; and I think Mr. <HI>Ranger</HI> also wrong, in excluding intirely his Opinion. What I purpose here is, to point out <HI>both the Ideas</HI> working strongly in his Mind, and what the Author intended as conducive to the Moral of his Play.</P>
<P>No Critic on <HI>Shakespear</HI> can better explain the Cha∣racters he draws, than the Poet himself does in every Speech; we not only see what his Persons are during the Scene represented, but we are also made acquainted by some nice Touches in each Play, with their former Mode of thinking and acting; and as no Poet ever un∣derstood.
<PB N="84" REF="87"/>Nature better in the Operation of the Pas∣sions, so he always makes them speak and act in the highest Conformity to their Characters: In this Respect his Genius and Judgment is every where equal to <HI>Horace</HI>'s Precept,
<Q><HI>Aetatis cujusque notandi sunt tibi Mores.</HI></Q></P>
<P><HI>Lear</HI>'s Deportment and Sentiments in regard to his Daughters in the first Act, and what <HI>Gonerill</HI> says of him to <HI>Regan,</HI> mark very plainly his Character; which is, that of <HI>a haughty, passionate, inconstant, weak old Man.</HI> He does not resign his Authority to his Daughters so much out of Love to them, as to rid himself of the Cares of Government—He retains the Name of King with a suitable Train of Attendants—He still commands with his former Impetuosity of Temper, and is jealous even of Trifles. This the ill natured Character of the Daughters will not suffer, and they are in Consultation in the most undutiful and unbecoming Manner to de∣prive him of his remaining Shew of Power: Their Be∣haviour and Ingratitude soon appear in the most glaring Instances, and make the old King sorely sensible, that he had <HI>given them</HI> ALL.—</P>
<P>Nature was <HI>Shakespear</HI>'s Guide, he describes the Imagination affected by concurring Causes to pave the Way for a Scene of the highest Distress—<HI>Lear,</HI> as a King and Father feels with great Sensibility the Shocks, of his Daughters Ingratitude and unnatural Treatment, and exhibits a moving Picture of the Feelings of the Heart, and the various Conflicts of Passions very expres∣sive of his Character and Circumstances; if the Poet had nothing more in view, he might have been well con∣tent with the masterly Picture he has drawn of his Di∣stress, Grief, and Rage in every Scene before the Loss of his Senses; but he has crowned the Distress by making him at last fix his Imagination on his own Rashness and Folly in giving away his ALL, and putting it out of his
<PB N="85" REF="88"/>Power to avenge himself. And 'tis this Reflection chief∣ly drives him to Madness.</P>
<P>The jesting of his Fool wholly turns upon his <HI>unking∣ing himself</HI> and retaining <HI>nothing,</HI> which <HI>Lear</HI> minutely attends to, and says, "A bitter Fool!—After <HI>Go∣nerill</HI>'s Proposal to reduce his Train, he breaks out, <HI>"Woe! that too late repents."</HI>—Then the Ingratitude of his Daughters and his own Folly deeply strike him.</P>
<Q><L>—O Lear, Lear, Lear!</L>
<L><HI>Beat at this Gate that let thy Folly in,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And thy dear Judgment out.</HI></L>
<L>Afterwards he says to <HI>Gonerill,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Thou shalt find,</HI></L>
<L><HI>That I'll resume the Shape which thou dist think</HI></L>
<L><HI>I have cast off for ever.</HI> Gon. <HI>do you mark that?</HI></L>
<L>In the next Scene, wrapt up in Thought, he says,</L>
<L>To TAKE 'T AGAIN PERFORCE!—<HI>Monster Ingratitude!</HI></L></Q>
<P>In this Line the two Ideas are strongly blended, and the <HI>Loss of Power</HI> foremost, for surely that was the obvious Reason of the Insults he had received; if he had still been in Possession, they would have continued to sprinkle him with <HI>Court Holy-water:</HI> The Fool, whose Phrase the last is, says,
<Q><L><HI>Fathers that wear Rags,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Do make their Children blind;</HI></L>
<L><HI>But Fathers that bear Bags,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Shall see their Children kind,</HI> &amp;c.</L></Q></P>
<P>I must here take Notice of the different Colouring used by our Poet, and all good Writers, in distinguishing the Characters of Men seemingly agitated by the same Passions. <HI>Lear</HI>'s Idea of his Folly, in divesting himself of his Authority, is nicely and artfully distinguished by <HI>Shakespear,</HI> from that Kind of Regret, which an im∣perious Man of a different Character would feel from the Deprivation of Power.—He is full of the Loss of his Dignity, only as it was the Occasion of the ill Treat∣ment he met with, and not from a Thirst of Rule.—
<PB N="86" REF="89"/>This Idea and that of the Ingratitude of his Daughters, which he feels as the Consequence of it, I cannot help thinking, are as closely united in his Madness, as two Twigs twisted together, and growing out of the same Stem.</P>
<P>When he exclaims and reproaches his Daughters in that heart-piercing Scene of Distress on the Heath, he says,
<Q><L>O Regan! O Gonerill!</L>
<L><HI>Your old kind Father! whose frank Heart</HI> gave all—</L>
<L><HI>O that Way Madness lies—Let me shun</HI> THAT—</L>
<L><HI>No more of</HI> THAT—</L></Q></P>
<P>On his Recollection that he <HI>gave all,</HI> he breaks short and immediately subjoins, "O that Way Madness lies; let me shun <HI>that;</HI> no more of <HI>that;—i. e.</HI> Let me not think that I have been guilty of so much Folly, as to have given <HI>all</HI> to such ungrateful Wretches—the Reflection will make me mad.</P>
<P>I know it may be insisted on by you, and perhaps by many others, that <HI>Lear</HI> makes use of the Sentiment of <HI>giving all,</HI> only to tax the Ingratitude of his Daughters in a higher Degree; but, tis possible, you may be of a contrary Opinion, if you can allow, that the Moral of this Play, does not expose the Ingratitude of Children, more than the Folly of Parents. <HI>This same Folly of Parents</HI> is also touched with great Judgment in the Under-plot of <HI>Glo'ster;</HI> and the Characters of <HI>Lear</HI>'s two Daughters are finely contrasted with those of <HI>Cordelia</HI> and <HI>Edgar;</HI> and the Poet's Design in marking out so strongly the Folly and ill-judged Partiality of Parents is confirmed by the Behaviour of <HI>Edmund</HI>—</P>
<P>When <HI>Lear</HI> sees the Wretchedness of <HI>Edgar,</HI> he pursues the same Train of Reasoning which before pos∣sest him, and asks, <Q><HI>Didst thou</HI> GIVE ALL <HI>to thy Daugh∣ters!—And art thou to come to this?</HI></Q> And immediately after,
<PB N="87" REF="90"/>
<Q><L><HI>What! Have his Daughters brought him to this Pass?</HI></L>
<L><HI>Could'st thou</HI> save nothing?—<HI>did'st thou</HI> give them all?</L></Q></P>
<P>This is agreeable to his Character—And from all that we hear in common Life (for there are many Stories) of old weak Parents, who have acted much in the Man∣ner of <HI>Lear,</HI> and to the Reproach of human Nature, have met with Ingratitude and Disobedience; these, I say, in their Feeling-hours of Distress, are reported to have re∣proached themselves with their Folly in GIVING ALL, as well as exclaimed against the Ingratitude of their Children.</P>
<P>There are many Characters, I doubt not, now in the World, who retain a Heap of Treasure, useless to them∣selves, from their Children, on no better Motives, than to insure their Duty and Attention; and some who carry the Moral of this Play to a ridiculous Height, by deny∣ing their Children an Independance, merely on the same Parity of Reasoning, without considering the Difference between the Prudence of Parents and their Folly.</P>
<P>I FORBEAR making any Quotations from <HI>Lear</HI>'s Speeches in his Madness. I think the Whole obvious enough, and that our immortal Poet, who had a perfect Knowledge of the Workings of the human Mind, has drawn <HI>both the Ideas</HI> in <HI>Lear</HI>'s Madness, agreeable to the Representation he has made of him in the first Act.</P>
<P>What I have hitherto said, is entirely confined to the different Opinions of Mr. <HI>Ranger</HI> and the <HI>Adventurer;</HI> nor do I expect that you shall alter your's in Conformity to my Judgment.—Let a diligent Examination of the Play determine you in the future Criticisms you intend to give the Public on this Subject.</P>
<P>WHAT has often occurr'd to me, in reading over the several Editions of our Poet, and what has been said by you, and many great Geniusses, only serve to convince me of the Difficulty of any one Man's succeeding in a perfect Criticism on <HI>Shakespear;</HI> at least, I have Reason
<PB N="88" REF="91"/>to think so, from what I have seen of the several At∣tempts that have been made by different Commentators from the Time of Mr. <HI>Rowe,</HI> to the mutilated Condition our Poet was thrown into by subsequent Editors.</P>
<P>Several Persons have succeeded in illustrating many of the Characters he draws, and have pointed out to public Notice, many of his latent Beauties; but, I be∣lieve, <Q><HI>there is scarce one Man alive</HI> (to speak in the Stile of a very extraordinary Address to a great Man, in last <HI>Saturday's Inspector) who is even capable of call∣ing all his Beauties by their proper Names,</HI> much less of <HI>exhibiting them all with Advantage to the Public;</HI> whose Property <HI>they now are, if they will acquire a Taste to enjoy 'em.</HI></Q></P>
<P>I can't forbear mentioning the Obligation which the Public has to the Genius of Mr. <HI>Garrick,</HI> who has ex∣hibited with great Lustre many of the most shining Strokes of <HI>Shakespear</HI>'s amazing Art; and may be justly stiled (as he was once called by you) his best Commen∣tator: For 'tis certain, he has done our Poet more Justice by his Manner of playing his principal Characters, than any Editor has yet done by a Publication.</P>
<P>I shall conclude with the same Freedom as I began, by desiring you will consider my Manner of treating this Subject, as the mere Hints of a friendly Letter, and not as an Essay on the Subject in Dispute.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HOUGH I have in my two last Papers entirely confined the Attention of my Rea∣ders to critical Enquiries, I shall make no Apology for offering another Essay this Day upon a Subject nearly connected with those Mat∣ters, the more especially as the Honour of our Coun∣try is in some Sort concerned in the present Lucubration against a <HI>French</HI> Writer, upon whom I have formerly animadverted, and who has taken in some Passages of his Works, unbecoming Liberties with the <HI>English</HI> Na∣tion.</P>
<P>Prefixed to <HI>Voltaire</HI>'s <HI>Merope,</HI> we find a Letter to <HI>Maffei</HI> (the Author of an <HI>Italian</HI> Tragedy on the same Subject) in which that Writer, after mentioning a faulty Piece which was performed on the <HI>English</HI> Stage; de∣livers himself in the following Words. <HI>Elle fut sans doute mal reque; mais n'est il pas bien etrange qu'on l'ait representie? N'est ce pas une preuve que le Teatre</HI> Angloise <HI>n'est pas encore epuré? Il semble que la méme cause qui prive les</HI> Angloise <HI>du Genie de la Painture &amp; de la Musique, leur óte aussi celui de la Tragedie. Cette Isle, qui a produit les plus grand Philosophes de la Terre, n'est pas aussi fertile pour les beaux Arts; &amp; si les</HI> Anglois <HI>ne s'appliquent seriensement a suivre les Preceptes de leurs excellens Citoyens</HI> Addison &amp; Pope, <HI>ils n'approcherent pas des autres Peuples en fait de Gout &amp; de Literature.</HI> <Q>The <HI>English Merope,</HI> (says <HI>Voltaire,</HI>) acted in the Year 1731, was not well
<PB N="91" REF="94"/>received; but is it not surprising that it was exhibited at all? May we not infer from thence, that the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> Stage has not as yet attained a due Degree of Re∣finement? It looks as if the same Cause, which has deprived the <HI>English</HI> of a Genius for Painting and Music, has also withheld from them the Spirit of Dra∣matic Poetry. That Island which has produced the greatest Philosophers in the World, is not so happy with Regard to the polite Arts, and unless they se∣riously attach themselves to the Precepts of their ex∣cellent Countrymen, <HI>Addison</HI> and <HI>Pope,</HI> they will be thrown at a Distance by other Nations in Point of Li∣terature and Productions of Taste.</Q></P>
<P>Because the Managers of a Theatre suffered a bad Piece to be represented, is it not unfair to derive from thence a Charge of Indelicacy upon a whole Nation, more particularly when the Reception this Piece met with from the Public is rather an Indication of a correct and just Taste?—</P>
<P>What the Cause is, which has deprived the <HI>English</HI> of a Genius for Painting and Music, I am at a Loss to de∣termine. Certain it is, those Arts flourished for a long Time in <HI>Italy,</HI> before they came over the <HI>Alps</HI> to our northern Regions; and it is certain that a Taste for them has prevailed many Years since in this Kingdom. They have been cultivated here with the greatest Delicacy by several eminent Masters, though we cannot boast as many exalted Geniusses as have adorned the softer Clime of <HI>Italy.</HI> The Transfiguration by <HI>Raphael,</HI> the Nativity by <HI>Corregio,</HI> and the last Judgment by <HI>Michael Angelo</HI> will perhaps never be matched any where else; but it is un∣fair to deduce a Conclusion from thence, that we have no Genius for this excellent imitative Art in <HI>England.</HI> Portrait-Painting has been in as great a Degree of Per∣fection in this Country as in any other Part of the World. Sir <HI>Godfrey Kneller</HI> found so much Taste among us, that he made this his own Country; and here—
<PB N="92" REF="95"/>
<Q><L>Lely <HI>on animated Canvas stole</HI></L>
<L><HI>The sleepy Eye, which spoke the melting Soul.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P><HI>But not to sneak from living worth to dead,</HI> as Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> finely expresses it, whoever, has observed with Attention the Performances of <HI>Hayman,</HI> must be con∣vinced that <HI>Voltaire</HI>'s Charge of a Want of Taste is perfectly groundless. Every Thing is put out of Hand by this excellent Artist with the utmost Grace and Delicacy, and his History-Pieces have, besides their beautiful Colouring, the most lively Expression of Cha∣racter. <HI>Hutson</HI>'s Rooms teem with mimic Life; and <HI>Hogarth,</HI> like a true Genius, has formed a new School of Painting for himself. He may be truly stiled the <HI>Cervantes</HI> of his Art, as he has exhibited the ridiculous Follies of human Nature with the most exquisite Hu∣mour, and he may be said to be the first, who has wrote Comedy with his Pencil. His <HI>Harlot's Progress,</HI> and <HI>Marriage A-la mode</HI> are, in my Opinion, as well drawn as any Thing in <HI>Moliere,</HI> and the Unity of Character, which is the Perfection of Dramatic Poetry, is so skilfully preserved, that we are surprized to see the same Personage thinking agreeably to his complexional Ha∣bits in the many different Situations, in which we after∣wards perceive him. The Frible, the Bully, the Poli∣tician, the Lawyer, the Miser, and in short all the strik∣ing Characters in Life are, by this Gentleman, so ad∣mirably depicted upon Canvas, that I am convinced <HI>Voltaire</HI> would be at a Loss to shew where he has been equalled by any of his Countrymen.—</P>
<P>We may also boast an equal Excellence in Music; for though Mr. <HI>Handell</HI> is not an <HI>Englishman,</HI> it is however a convincing Proof of our national Taste, that we have made it worth his while to fix his Residence among us, and that we have shewn a due Sensibility to manly Me∣lody, where the Sound is expressive of the Sense, and where no unnatural Divisions, nor idle insignificant
<PB N="93" REF="96"/>Quirks mislead the Ear in a thrilling Maze of wild and and random Notes. It is owing to the Encouragement we have afforded this Gentleman, that we can now boast the noblest and most rational Music in the World. Be∣sides, such a Genius as Doctor <HI>Boyce</HI> will be always suf∣ficient to vindicate us from <HI>Voltaire</HI>'s national Oppro∣brium, and the Admirers of <HI>Arne</HI> have constantly cele∣brated him for his peculiar Talent, at finding the most emphatic Expression in a Composition, and discovering where the Passions are placed in every Piece of Poetry. To these Passages he never fails to give their full Energy, and like a ravishing Commentator he brings new Beauties into Light with such a Sweetness of Harmony, that every Breast yields irresistibly to the melting Impression. I am proud to have an Opportunity of saying that we are likely to have an <HI>English</HI> Opera set to Music by the last mentioned Gentleman, which, I persuade myself, will do Honour to him and his Country.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Since the Time, when the above Essay was wrote, Mr. <HI>Smith,</HI> a Pupil of Mr. <HI>Handell</HI>'s, has displayed a noble Genius for musical Composition, and the Success, which his Opera, called the <HI>Fairies,</HI> met with on <HI>Drury-Lane</HI> Stage, at once gives lustre to his Merit, and is a Proof of the public Taste.</NOTE></P>
<P>With Regard to Dramatic Poetry, our Advantage over every Nation in the known World is, I think, very apparent. The best Critics have laid it down as a Rule that a Performance is to be judged by its Number of striking Beauties, and not by some Inaccuracies, and the Instances of occasional Conformity to the vicious Taste of the Times. If <HI>Shakespear</HI> is viewed in this light he will certainly appear to any unprejudiced Rea∣der infinitely superior to <HI>Corneille, Racine,</HI> and all the polished Writers of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Italy.</HI> I remember a Pas∣sage in <HI>Voltaire</HI>'s Writings, where he is at infinite Pains to bring together a String of Quotations from the best <HI>French</HI> Tragedies to evince their great Talents for the sublime; in all he makes up about twenty or thirty at
<PB N="94" REF="97"/>most; and the Beauties of <HI>Shakespear</HI> have of late been published in several Volumes. Besides, <HI>Otway</HI> has found Access to the Heart better than any <HI>French Writer</HI> what∣ever, and the domestic Passions are touched by him with the greatest Elegance and Simplicity. It is very common on the <HI>French</HI> Stage to hear a Personage of the Drama, exclaiming perpetually <HI>Helas,</HI> and <HI>mon Dicu!</HI> and then formally acquainting the Audience that he feels such and such Sensations; but our great Masters of the Passions make their Hearers feel by Sympathy the Agitations of their Hero's Breast, without running into cold languid Declamation.</P>
<P>The Dramatic Poetry of this Country is like our Con∣stitution, built upon the bold Easis of Liberty; and though the latter has brought our King to the Block, and the former admits Blood to be shed on the Stage; these are Corruptions which have intruded, and are, as the Poets says,
<Q><HI>Effects unhappy from a noble Cause.</HI></Q> Upon the whole, we may apply, what <HI>Horace</HI> has said to the <HI>English</HI> Nation,
<Q><L><HI>—Spirat Tragicum satis, &amp; feliciter audet</HI></L>
<L><HI>Sed turpem putat in Chartis metuitque lituram.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>Our Poets are sufficiently possessed of the Spirit of Tragedy, but they are not attentive to the minute Rules of correct Taste, and the Trouble of blotting. It may be added, that they have more real Fire, sublimer Sen∣timents, and Characters better marked than any Nation whatever; and with regard to Painting and Music, we can boast so many Masters in both as might have pre∣vented the <HI>French</HI> Author from charging us with a Want of Genius, and Taste for the fine Arts.</P>
<P>I cannot dismiss this Paper, without observing, that it is a very particular Pleasure to me, to find the Subject, on which I have been hitherto offering some scattered Reflections, touched upon with great Spirit by a Writer of acknowledged Genius.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Gathric.</HI></NOTE> In a Preface to
<PB N="93" REF="98"/>a Novel called the FRIENDS, he has expressed himself with great Warmth, and a noble national Jealousy. After mentioning that <HI>Voltaire</HI> calls his Countrymen, THE ABSOLUTE LEGISLATORS OF ALL THE FINE ARTS IN EUROPE, "how shameless," says he, <Q>is this Asser∣tion in the Face of a Country, that gave Bread to <HI>Holben,</HI> Dignities to <HI>Reubens,</HI> and Encouragement to <HI>Vandike;</HI> and that for Years before (even by this Writer's own Acknowledgment) the national Taste of <HI>France</HI> was formed! While that Taste was barbarous, <HI>Johnson</HI> enriched his native Tongue with Comedies, wrought up to more than <HI>Terentian</HI> Regularity and Propriety, in point of Conduct; and while <HI>France</HI> was ignorant of almost every Order of Architecture, <HI>Inigo Jones,</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> was rearing Houses, and projecting Palaces which all the boasted Improve∣ments of <HI>France,</HI> in that Art, have not yet equalled. I shall forbear to urge the Examples of <HI>Spencer</HI> or <HI>Shakespear,</HI> because I am firmly and seriously of Opi∣nion, that no <HI>Frenchman</HI> ever yet was able (supposing him to understand <HI>English</HI> equally as <HI>French</HI>) to taste the Beauties of either of these Poets. For the Truth of this, I appeal to every <HI>Englishman</HI>'s Sense, who has had the Misfortune to read the unwilling, scanty, starved and mistaken Encomiums, that <HI>Voltaire</HI> has bestowed on <HI>Shakespear.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Is it not rather too charitable in the Author of the foregoing Passage to suppose Monsieur <HI>Voltaire</HI>'s reserved Praises of <HI>Shakespear</HI> could arise only from an Inability of relishing his Beauties? For my Part, I must avow it, the <HI>French</HI> Writer appears to me capable of feeling every Stroke of our great Poet, but Envy, and a vain Ambition of erecting himself into an imagined Superiority, have rendered him open and explicit in his Abuses, and he∣sitating and frigid in his Commendations. But to con∣clude; what <HI>Virgil</HI> has given away from his Country∣men, we claim for ours. None better shall inform the
<PB N="96" REF="99"/>breathing Brass, or soften Marble into mimic Features; none shall better plead, or with equal Sagacity describe the Motions of the planetary System, and the Laws of Nature; and besides, it shall be our further Praise to spare a vanquished Foe, and to check the Encroachments of an intriguing, faithless, perfidious Enemy, ever rest∣less and aiming at an universal Monarchy, which, it is to be hoped, the Councils and Arms of <HI>Great Britain</HI> will for ever hold from them.</P>

<P>THE Tragedy of <HI>Richard the Third</HI> was performed here lately, and as there were many Circumstances in the Battle, which was fought in the fifth Act, quite un∣known to the Audience, it may not be improper to give some Account of that Engagement. The Theatrical Cock had done Salutation to the Morn, and <HI>Richard</HI> had ani∣mated the Soldiery, when the Attack was begun on the Left-Wing, under the Command of the Lord High <HI>Con∣stable Grey.</HI> This Impression was received by General <HI>Raf∣tor,</HI> who ordered the Woods to be scowered, but the Enemy setting up the War-hoop, he was repulsed into the Green-Room, where he rallied his Spirits and his Forces, and again returned to the Charge. Upon this the Fight was renewed with great Alacrity, and continued very ob∣stinate, until a general Desolation stretched the greatest Part of the Combatants upon the Scene of Action. Upon this occasion General <HI>Raftor</HI> fell greatly lamented, and (if we may be allowed to imitate <HI>Sallust</HI>) the same Absence of Passion, for which he was remarkable while living, was legible in his Countenance. Lord High Constable <HI>Grey</HI> was overpowered by Numbers, and his Body was taken up, far from his Friends, among fallen Heaps of the Enemy, still breathing short, and clinching his Staff with the same Eagerness he had done all his
<PB N="97" REF="100"/>Life. Lieutenant General <HI>Mar</HI> fell much lamented. We cannot at present furnish an exact Account of the Loss on either Side, but the Muster-Roll, which has been handed to us, stands as follows,

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> LATELY met with a Fable, in a <HI>French</HI> Writer, which I thought, carried with it a great Deal of Propriety, and, though it was rather eked out, as is sometimes the Case among the liveliest Geniusses of that Country, beyond the just Limits prescribed by the Matter con∣tained in it, it was however conducted with such a Pret∣tiness of Fancy and Expression, that I was very much entertained with the Perusal of it. Poetry, (says my Author) is the Son of the God of <HI>Ease</HI> and the God∣dess of <HI>Meditation.</HI> He bears in his Appearance such a strong Resemblance to these his Parents, that it is im∣possible, to mistake the Marks of his Legitimacy, and
<PB N="98" REF="101"/>therefore, whenever these Proofs of his Birth are de∣ficient, we may with Reason conclude him to be of a spurious Breed.</P>
<P>From his Father, he derives his apparent Indolence, his Serenity, his graceful Elocution, and his unlaboured Turn of Thought, together with his elegant Feli∣city in all his Compositions; a remarkable Neglect of the ordinary Uses of Life, a Disregard for Riches, and a total Absence of all worldly Ambition, save what is inspired by Virtue and honest Fame, are his di∣stinguishing Characteristics. From his Mother, he pos∣sesses his Modesty, which makes him not very fond of obtruding himself into Company; his pensive Air, which inclines him to be always enforcing some Precept of Morality, or some Topic which may be subservient to the Use or Enjoyment of Life; his Love of Solitude, which induces him to shun Crowds and great Cities, and leads him into rural Scenes, where he may give free Scope to his Imagi∣nation undisturbed by the Cares and Anxieties of Life. The same Disposition in his Temper renders him not very fond of being known by the Bulk of Mankind, that he may prevent the Inconveniencies attendant on him when his Affairs require that he should make his Appearance in Public. If he puts any thing abroad into the World, and thinks proper to publish the Re∣sult of his contemplative Moments, he does not like to be pointed at by the Multitude, but chuses to receive the Tribute of Applause, obtained by his Writings, without being liable to the Sarcasms, the Taunts, and malevolent Jests, which are always the sure Concomi∣tants of Praise, and which are generally a very great Discount upon his Happiness.</P>
<P>From these Motives he is enamoured with Retirement, and he is further confirmed in his sequestred State by a Consideration, that the more he keeps himself at a
<PB N="99" REF="102"/>Distance from the Rest of Mankind, the more Beau∣ties they are willing to descry in his Productions; in like Manner as the Hills, and the remote Parts of a Prospect present a more vivid Green, than when our Advances to them have brought the Scene more close to our Inspection, and the Heath, the craggy Rock, and ploughed Land, are familiarised to the naked Eye.</P>
<P>This is the Substance of the Fable; the Meaning that it inculcates is certainly very just and obvious. The best Writers in all Ages have subscribed to it, and the most applauded of the antient Poets are constantly offering warm Pictures of rural Imagery to our Ima∣ginations; they seem to be stifled with Dust and Smoke, when they mention a City-Life, and we frequently sind them expatiating with Rapture upon the Pleasures of a Country-Life, which they look upon to be the Nurse of Thought, and the only Sphere in which their Studies can be prosecuted with any Degree of Success.</P>
<P>The same Observation will hold good with Regard to all Kinds of Writing, unless it be those excellent Productions of the Press which make their Appearance under the various Shapes of <HI>Newgate</HI>-Memoirs, New's-Papers, and political Pamphlets. In Works that call for a long Train of Reasoning, subtile Disquisitions, and unwearied Application, undoubtedly the proper Place to accomplish them, is in those Regions, where Riot and Debauchery are Strangers; where Gaming, Drinking, and idle Amusements of all Sorts are un∣known, and where, above all, Health and Cheerfulness add new Lustre to the Face of Things.</P>
<P>It may perhaps seem a Paradox, if I should assert, that, among all the Gentlemen of the Quill, there is not one, to whom Solitude and Ease are more necessary than the periodical Writer; but though his Compo∣sitions are generally comprized in a narrow Com∣pass, and though he does not, for the most Part,
<PB N="100" REF="103"/>pretend to search every Subject to the Bottom; though it is not expected of him to lay before the Reader deep, philosophical Speculations, abstracted Reasonings, and new Systems of Morality and Religion; yet, in my Apprehension, it will be found, upon an attentive Survey of his Situation, that it is particularly incumbent on the Adventurer in this Way, to withdraw himself from the Bustle of Mankind, and to appear, as seldom as possible in little Circles at Coffee-houses, convivial Clubs at Taverns, and the long Train of public Places, which serve no other Purpose in this Metropolis than merely to kill Time, as the Phrase is, and to hurry a Person into a Course of Vanity and Dissipation.</P>
<P>There is a Passage in Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> which I have ever perused with Admiration, because it shews him to have been a Man of the most prudent Understanding, as well as the most finished Poet; Two Adjuncts which are seldom found to coexist.</P>
<Q><L><HI>I ne'er with Wits, and Witlings pass'd my Days,</HI></L>
<L><HI>To spread about the Itch of vulgar Praise.</HI></L>
<L><HI>Nor, like a Puppy, daggl'd thro' the Town,</HI></L>
<L><HI>To fetch and carry Sing-song up and down.</HI></L>
<L><HI>Nor at Rehearsals mouth'd, and sweat, and cry'd,</HI></L>
<L><HI>With Handkerchief and Orange at my Side.</HI></L>
<L><HI>I askt no Homage from the Race that write,</HI></L>
<L><HI>But kept, like Eastern Monarchs, from their Sight;</HI></L>
<L><HI>And sick of Fops and Poetry, and Prate,</HI></L>
<L><HI>To</HI> Bufo <HI>lest the whole</HI> Castalian <HI>State.</HI></L></Q>
<P>Perhaps too great a Tincture of Pride runs through these Lines, for any one else to make Application of them to himself. <HI>Pope</HI> had Talents superior to al∣most all Mankind, but if a more humble Writer can∣not withdraw himself from our present Town-Smarts and Critics, like an Eastern Monarch, he may at least accomplish it, like <HI>Juvenal</HI>'s Friend in his third Satire,
<PB N="101" REF="104"/>who retired from <HI>Rome,</HI> to avoid its Plagues and In∣conveniencies.</P>
<Q><HI>— Atque unum civem donare Sibyllae.</HI></Q>
<P>It is possible, my Readers may think these Tenets inconsistent with the Character of <HI>Ranger;</HI> but airy and gay as <HI>Ranger</HI> may appear, he is now perfectly averse to the wild Sallies of his Namesake in the Play: He would not chuse to stagger home from a Box and Dice in the Morning, nor to get through a Window into an honest Gentleman's House at Night; he can∣not run after every white Apron he sees, nor keep Company with a Set of Fellows whom he despises. And yet there are Dissipations to which a Resident in Town is for ever liable; add to these, the Danger attendant on a Writer's making himself known in too many Quarters of the Town. Prejudices are ever apt to arise against an Author, who does not take care to conceal himself. The Transition is so quick from the Performance to the Person who produced it, that from the Moment a Man begins to publish, he is enlisted into a State of Warfare with almost all the Critics and <HI>Malevoli</HI> of the Age.</P>
<P>Some Readers have no Criterion, by which to judge of a Production, except the Rules of Physiognomy; and if an Author appears younger than themselves, they hold it absolutely impossible to receive any Instruction from him. It is, by the Way, somewhat strange that this experienced Class will not allow a Man to be sit to entertain them, until his Imagination begins to flag, his Invention to close, like Flowers at the Setting of the Sun, his Memory to decay, and his Wit, if he have any Share of it, to become slow and tardy. This however, is what is desired by the Man who would look an Author in the Teeth to know his Age, and from thence make an Estimate of his Merit.</P>
<Q><HI>Qui redit ad fastos, &amp; virtutem estimat annis.</HI></Q>
<P><PB N="102" REF="105"/>There is another Set of People who make it their Business to pry into a Writer's Connections, and tho∣roughly inform themselves of his Attachments, his Friendships, and his Resentments. According as these coincide with their own Way of Thinking, they blame or approve; even though the Author is absolutely im∣partial in his Animadversions. <Q>There, says one, <HI>Ran∣ger</HI> is right—<HI>O, D—n</HI> the Fellow! was ever such a Position as this?—my dear <HI>Ranger,</HI> that won't pass upon us—We know you are ptejudiced in this Affair —and there again; — You praise this Man because you are intimate with him. — Did I not see you walk Arm in Arm with him, the other Night, at the Coffee-house?</Q></P>
<P>In this Manner is the Person judged, who attempts to run the dangerous Career of Wit, as <HI>Boileau</HI> ex∣presses it, <HI>du bel Esprit la Carriere epineuse;</HI> and upon the whole, I think it may be laid down as a Maxim, that no periodical Writer should ever reside in this Metropolis, that he may effectually evade the Censures of Prejudice, the Blasts of Detraction, the Envy of rival Wit, and the several Avocations of a Town-Life. It may be added, that it is absolutely necessary, that an Author should never suffer himself to be known, on Account of the Antipathy which will arise to his Per∣son. <HI>Patroclus</HI> conquered for a long Time in the Armour of <HI>Achilles;</HI> but had he let the Secret escape abroad, with double his Strength and Valour, he would not have been able to atchieve any Thing remarkable against the <HI>Trojans,</HI> who would have instantly conceived an utter Contempt of the Man, whom they dreaded in a feigned Appearance.</P>

As the Sanction of so great a Genius would, in all Probability, greatly ferve the Purposes of the noble Writer, it will in some Measure defeat that End, and convince Man∣kind that Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> thought the Imputation of Deism would blemish that fair Fame of which he was ena∣moured; and it may prove entertaining to the meer

<LETTER>
<HEAD><HI>A Letter from the Chevalier</HI> RAMSAY <HI>to M.</HI> RACINE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WAS highly pleased, and do not doubt but you will be pleased also, at the Receipt of a Letter which Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> has sent me to be forwarded to you. You will perceive by the Contents, that it was not with∣out just Grounds, I undertook, in a former Letter, to justify the Principles of my illustrious Countryman. My Vindication of him might possibly be suspected to have its Source in Friendship; and therefore lose great∣ly of its Strength. But here, Sir, he pleads his own Defence; his Letter will demonstrate to you his Zeal for Religion, and it is to be hoped, will silence his Ac∣cusers. You will find it accompanied by a Defence of his System, written by Mr. <HI>Warburton,</HI> a celebrated Clergyman of the Church of <HI>England.</HI> Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> by distributing this Performance amongst his Friends, adopts the Doctrine, approves the Sentiments, and thereby gives to the whole an additional Value.</P>
<P>The Opinion, which you conceived of Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> is on your Side very excusable. You received the Im∣pression from the Misrepresentations of his Enemies, for many Enemies he has. <HI>Urit enim fulgero suo,</HI> &amp;c. His superior Talents have excited a great deal of Envy towards his Person, and his Connections with several eminent Personages, all engaged in opposite Interests, or attached to the Court, have further served to inflame the Minds of Men against him. But there are many evincing Proofs of his Probity, and the Incorruptibility of his Principles.</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="110"/>I have been informed, that he was in Intimacy with several successive Ministers, and often with many at the same Time. Thus circumstanced, it would have been easy for him to create a large Fortune, had he availed himself of the Disgrace of one Party, in order to recommend himself to the other. But he possessed a Soul superior to such mean Artifices.</P>
<P>My Intelligence adds further, that the Queen, who was an Admirer of his Genius, expressed an Inclination to employ him, without requiring any Thing further of him than a dissembled Conformity to the established Religion of his Country, promising, at the same Time, to dispense with the Strictness of the Oath usually ad∣ministered upon such Occasions But Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> was in∣accessible to Temptation, which may serve to prove he was directed by other Principles than those of a Sceptic or a Deist.</P>
<P>I must assure you, Sir, that I am not induced to this Task by supererogatory Friendship to Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> nor am I willing to offer him the Incense of Adulation. I mean solely to serve the Cause of Truth and Justice, and am,</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Expectation, in which I have been for some Time past, of receiving the Present you have honoured me with, was the Occasion of my delaying so long to answer your Letter. I am at length favoured with your Poem on Religion, and should have received, from the Perusal of it, a Pleasure unmixed with Pain, had I not the Mortification to find, that you impute several Principles to me which I abhor and detest. My Uneafiness met some Alleviation, from a Passage in
<PB N="108" REF="111"/>your Preface, where you declare your Inability, from a Want of Knowledge of the <HI>English</HI> Language, to give your own Judgment on the <HI>Essay on Man;</HI> you add, that you do not controvert my Tenets, but the evil Consequences deducible from them, and the Drift of some Passages in my Poem, which Persons of notable Sagacity imagine they have discovered. This Decla∣ration is a shining Proof of your Candor, your Discre∣tion and your Charity. I must take Leave to assure you, Sir, that your Unacquaintance with the Original has not proved more fatal to me, than the imperfect Con∣ceptions of my Translators, who have not sufficiently informed themselves of my real Sentiments. Though the many additional Embellishments, which my Piece has received from the elegant Version of <HI>M. D. R</HI>—, have done an Honour to the <HI>Essay on Man;</HI> yet it has, on the other Hand, suffered a greater Injury from his frequent Mis-apprehension of the Principles it incul∣cates. These Mistakes you will perceive are totally refuted in the <HI>English</HI> Piece, which I have transmitted to you. It is a critical and philosophic Commentary written by the learned Author of the <HI>divine Legation of Moses.</HI> I flatter myself that the Chevalier <HI>Ramsay</HI> will, from his Zeal for Truth, take the Trouble to ex∣plain the Contents of it. I shall then perswade myself that your Suspicions will be effaced, and I shall have no Appeal from your Candor and Justice.</P>
<P>In the mean Time I shall not hesitate to declare my∣self very cordially in Regard to some Particulars, about which you have desired an Answer.</P>
<P>I must avow then openly and sincerely, that my Principles are diametrically opposite to the Sentiments of <HI>Spinoza</HI> and <HI>Leibuitz;</HI> they are perfectly coincident with the Tenets of <HI>M. Paschal,</HI> and the Archbishop of <HI>Cambray,</HI> and I shall always esteem it an Honour to me, to imitate the Moderation, with which the latter sub∣mitted his private Opinions to the Decisions of the

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Mildness and Humility, with which you justify yourself, is a convincing Proof of your Religion; the more so, as you have done it to one, on whom it is incumbent to make his own Apology for his rash Attack upon your Character. Your Manner of pardoning me is the more delicate, as it is done without any Mixture of Reproach; but though you acquit me with so much Politeness, I shall not so easily forgive myself.</P>
<P>Certain it is, a Precipitance of Zeal hurried me away. As I had often heard Positions said to be yours, or at least Consequences resulting from your Essay, cited against certain Truths (which I now find you respect as much as myself) I thought, I had a Right to enter the Lists with you. The Passage, in my Preface, was extorted from me by a Degree of Remorse, which I felt in writing against you. This Remorse, Sir, was awakened in me by the Consideration, that the greatest Men are always the most susceptible of the Truths of Revelation. I was really grieved to think that Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> should oppose a Religion, whose Enemies have ever been contemptible, and it appeared strange, that in a Work which points out the Road to Happiness, you should furnish Arms to those, who are industrious to misguide us in the Research.</P>
<P>Your Letter, at the same Time that it does Honour to your Character, must bring a Blush in my Face, for having entertained unjust Suspicions; but, notwith∣standing this, I think myself obliged to make it public; the Injury which I have done you, was so, the Repa∣ration
<PB N="110" REF="113"/>should be the same. I owe this to you; I owe it to myself; I owe it to Justice.</P>
<P>Whatever may be urged in your Favour in the Commentary you have sent me, it is now rendered un∣necessary by your own Declaration. The Respect, which you avow for Religion, is a sufficient Vindica∣tion of your Doctrine; I will add, that for the Future, those among us, who shall feel the laudable Ambition of making their Poetry subservient to Re∣ligion, ought to take you for their Model, and it should ever be remembred, that the greatest Poet, in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> is one of the humblest Sons of the Church.

<P>THAT we have had a Share, by our joint En∣deavours, in obtaining a Repeal of the <HI>Jew-Bill,</HI> affords me muckle Content, but notwithstanding this Suc∣cess, there is still another Matter that has purturbed my Spirits for some Time past. I believe, I need nottell one of Mr. <HI>Ranger</HI>'s quick Penetration, that I mean the <HI>Mar∣riage-Act,</HI> which, I make no Doubt, was designed for very good and laudable Purposes, but will most certainly, in its Consequences, prove of the utmost Detriment to this

I already see them dwindling by Degrees into an emaciated, puny, sickly Race; and let me tell you, Mr. <HI>Ranger,</HI> it cannot be otherwise, if, for the fu∣ture, they are only to marry among one another, without any possible Means of improving the Breed by a Mix∣ture of wholesome Flesh and Blood. To what a wretched State <HI>England</HI> may be reduced, I have lately had an Opportunity of observing in some Scenes that were really very affecting. As I was sojourning upon the Height of a <HI>Caledonian</HI> Mountain, the Air was suddenly rarified to a greater Degree of Purity than usual, and such Openings of Futurity were disclosed to me, that I am even now shocked at the Reflection. As I was formerly taught the Rudiments of Humanity, and instructed to indite a Letter, by my Friend Mr. <HI>M'Gregor,</HI> a worthy <HI>Philomath</HI> of <HI>Aberdeen,</HI> I resolved to lose no Time, but to send the Particulars of my Vision to my Friend <HI>Ranger;</HI> and this too I have done, as I did upon the former Occasion, in the Form of a New's-Paper, which I am sure will be the Stile of the Times.</P>

<P>THE Company were entertained, Yesterday Evening, by a Dispute between the Doctors OPIUM and SNAKEROOT, upon the Question whether Preaching or Playing is of the greatest Service to a Christian Community. Doctor SNAKEROOT thought pro∣per to declare that though he had not seen the Inside of a Church any Time these fifteen Years past, yet, unless the Method of exhibiting was different from what it used to be, when he was taken to those Places by his Grand∣mother, he could not possibly conceive what could be the Advantage of frequenting them. Doctor OPIUM, not a little picqued at this Declaration, thought pro∣per on his Part to mention that he knew as little of what passed within the Walls of the Church as the
<PB N="117" REF="120"/>other; but out of Respect to many reverend Digni∣taries, who were his extreme good Patients, he could not help thinking, that those Assemblies, under proper Management, might be rendered a tolerable instructive Amusement. <Q>I grant you, (replied <HI>Snakeroot)</HI> if the Managers would pay some little Deference to the public Taste; and in these Cases it ought to be consulted, for it appears to me that Preaching and Playing had originally a pretty close Affinity. Indeed I know nothing that can give a better Idea of the Simplicity of the antient Drama, which, without any Distinction of Scenes was divided into <HI>three Acts,</HI> reci∣ted by one Person, and each of them closed by a <HI>Chorus;</HI> and they were generally presented upon some Festival, instituted in Honour of the Deities; and as a further Proof, you know, Sir, (continued he) that in their Churches they still retain the Word. <HI>Pulpit,</HI> which the <HI>Greek</HI> Writers made use of to signify a Stage.</Q> Doctor OPIUM was going to reply when his Discourse was interrupted by the Appearance of Mr. HARTSHORN, the Apothecary, who hastily came up and for about five Minutes buried his Nose in the Periwig of the said Doctor. A Consultation was then held by the said Doctor OPIUM, the said Mr. HARTSHORN, and the said Doctor OPIUM'S Cane; when they all three withdrew together, and left Doctor SNAKEROOT in quiet Possession of the Argument.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Chambers over my Apartment in <HI>Gray's-Inn</HI> having been unoccupied for a considerable Time past, I was enabled to pursue my Lu∣cubrations with the greater Ease and Tran∣quillity, being free from those sudden Alarms of Noise, which are otherwise inevitable in any of the Inns of Court. But my Repose has met with an Interruption of so pleasant a Kind, that I have determined to acquaint my Readers with all the Particulars of the Incident.</P>
<P>About ten Days since, a Gentleman entered upon the Premises, and ever since I have been frequently disturbed, when at my Studies, by such quick and unexpected Shocks, that it was absolutely impossible for me to pur∣sue the same Train of Thought with any Degree of At∣tention. As I was Yesterday-Morning perusing Mr. <HI>Hawkins Brown</HI>'s excellent Poem upon the Immortality of the Soul, in which he has artfully combined in their full Force all the Arguments in Support of that impor∣tant Article of our Belief, suddenly I heard a violent Bounce over my Head; the Cieling shook as if ready to come down, and a Convulsion shook the whole House. Deep Contemplation sometimes unbraces the Nerves to such a Degree, that an unexpected Noise startles the whole Frame of the Body, and throws the Spirits out of that placid State, which is requisite in order to think with Calmness and Perspicuity. This Discomposure I experienced upon so many Occasions, and sometimes in
<PB N="119" REF="122"/>such quick Succession, that I judged it proper to step up Stairs to the Gentleman, to inform him of the Incon∣veniencies, which I lay under, and to beg of him to manage his Affairs for the future with less Turbulence.</P>
<P>I knocked two or three Times at his Door, but re∣ceiving no Answer, and hearing him run about with great Violence of Exertion, I made bold to walk in unbid. You go into the Dining-Room through a Glass-Folding-Door, which was at this Time shut, but the Curtains undrawn. Through the Window, I saw the Gentleman pulling off his Cloaths with the utmost Vehemence, and in an Instant he appeared in the Ha∣bit and Air, of an old Woman delivering Doctor <HI>Rock</HI>'s Bills upon <HI>Ludgate-Hill.</HI> Surprized at this Change, I stopt short to observe the Actions of this extraordinary Personage, and very shortly I was entertained with ano∣ther Vicissitude of Appearance; for, quick as Lighten∣ing, he shifted Cloaths, and walked about the Room with a Basket, and with an audible Voice pronounced, <Q>Muf∣fins for Coffee and Tea, Gentlemen and Ladies.</Q> This appeared extremely whimsical; he then varied his Dress, and with a Silver Pipe cried out <HI>London-Evening Post:</HI> After which he threw away his Bundle of Papers, fall down upon his Knees, laid his Hand on his Heart, looked up with a great Expression of Joy, and then rising, indulged himself in all the whimsical Vagaries of a Man frantic with Sensations too exquisite to endure. In this Way he continued for some Time, and at length threw himself into an Attitude of Surprize; after which, he ran wild about the Room, like one almost distracted with Despair, looking up in vain to Heaven for Relief, when to my great Amazement, he unexpectedly mustered up his Spirits, and with great Alacrity leaped through a small Aperture into the Coal-Hole. After absconding there for a short Space of Time, he came forth with a Sack of Coals upon his Shoulders, which he emptied in the Middle of the Room, calling with some Earnest∣ness,
<PB N="120" REF="123"/><HI>"Below."</HI> He had no sooner done this, but he directed his Eyes sparkling with Joy to some imaginary Object with which his Fancy seemed to be highly pleased; He then came forward, and knocked at the Door, where I had taken my Station, which I then took an Opportunity to open, and as I was advancing towards him, he seized me by the Shoulder, and twin∣ing me round with all his Strength sent me reeling into a Corner of his Room. Upon this, he walked into the outward Apartment, slapping the Door after him, and immediately opened a small Casement Window, which was over the Door of his Bed-Chamber. From thence he stretched out his Neck, and looking me full in the Face, burst out into a loud Fit of Laughter; then pro∣ducing a Squirt, he began to let fly at me in such a Manner, that I was soon pretty well watered from Head to Foot. The Exclamations, which I vented upon this Occasion, rung such a Peal in the Gentleman's Ears, that he was brought to a Recollection of himself. He came down very leisurely from his Post, and with a modest Air and genteel Address he politely asked my Pardon, and told me that he was so intent upon his Busi∣ness, that he really did not perceive that he was offer∣ing Indignities to a Stranger.—</P>
<P>Imagining that I was in the Hands of a Madman, I was willing to acquiesce with his Apology, but to satisfy my Curiosity, I took the Liberty to enquire of him, the Nature of his Business and what might be his Vocation. <Q>Sir, said the Gentleman, won't you please to be seated, With regard to my Business, Sir, I am a Pantomime Poet—a Pantomime Poet!</Q>—<Q>Pray, Sir, what is a Pantomime Poet?</Q>—To this Question my Friend answered with a Smile, <Q>a Writer of Pantomime, Sir. —It is a Plan which I have determined to apply my∣self to, having Reason to think that it is the only Way of succeeding in the present Age. I was bred at <HI>Eton</HI> School, from whence at a proper Time I was re∣moved
<PB N="121" REF="124"/>to the University; at both which Places I laid in a sufficient Store of <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin,</HI> and always feeling a particular Turn for the Drama I applied my Genius principally to Tragedy and Comedy. In each Species of Writing I have given the finishing Hand to some Pieces which have received the Approbation of a few Gentlemen of known Taste and perfectly versed in critical Matters. Encouraged by their Opinion I came to Town, and after a long tedious Application I find it impossible to get any of my Performances ex∣hibited. Mr. <HI>Garrick</HI> has already, like a provident General, laid his Plan of Operations, and Mr. <HI>Rich</HI> is determined to bring on no new Pieces, until we have such a Genius as <HI>Tom Durfey</HI></Q> <HI>I wish Mr.—, says he, we had such another Writer now.</HI> <Q>On this Ac∣count I have taken a Resolution to cultivate a Species of the Drama, which cannot fail of being profitable to all Parties, and, being agreeable to the public Taste, will be brought on without Difficulty as soon as offered.</Q>—</P>
<P>Here I broke in upon the Thread of his Discourse, by asking if he was determined to become Harlequin himself? To this he answered me in the Negative; but as it is a Rule in Writing to place yourself in the Situa∣tion of the Character for which you are to find suit∣able Dialogue, he had judged it not improper to con∣form to this Precept, and therefore, in order the better to concert the sudden Escapes and Changes of Dress, which have so pleasing an effect in this kind of Poetry, he was practising over every striking Attitude, and every unexpected Situation of the Harlequin, that he might be the better able to form an Opinion of the Plot and the several Incidents of the Marvellous, which he had found it necessary to introduce. He proceeded to inform me, that he purposed calling his first Piece HARLEQUIN TRIUMPHANT, or POETRY IN THE SUDS. In this Performance the whole Race of Authors are to be ex∣posed
<PB N="122" REF="125"/>to the Derision of the Public, and Harlequin is to crack a very great Number of facetious Jokes upon their shoulders with his wooden Sword. A Poet is to be placed at a Table with a Beef-stake laid before him, to his inexpressible Joy, when in an Instant, by some cu∣rious Stroke of Art, the solid Substance is to be changed into a modern Tragedy, and <HI>Calvert</HI>'s <HI>Entire Butt</HI> wafted away from his longing Eyes. The Bard after this is to be ducked in a Well, and then tossed dry in a Blanket, while Mother <HI>Dulness</HI> enjoys the sprightly Vein of Mirth, happy to see her Orders so faithfully executed. In short, the unhappy Poets are to undergo every Indig∣nity that human Wit can invent; and in Contrast to this, Harlequin is to riot in Luxury; the Spring is to pour fourth her freshest Verdure to charm his Eye, Summer to ripen the various Fruits upon the loaded Boughs, in order to regale his Palate; Autumn must administer the circling Glass, and Winter expand the frozen Surface of the Waters for him to skate with all his Dignity, in Sight of the astonished Audience.</P>
<P>Though this Plan appeared highly romantic to me at first Sight, I could not help telling the Gentleman, that I made no doubt but he would find his Account in it. I told him, that the surest Way to rise in the World was to gratify the Follies of the People, and therefore com∣mended this Scheme, which I am convinced cannot fail of Success. I just then hinted, that if he could contrive to be less violent in his Studies, I should take it as a Fa∣vour, and after assuring him of my sincere Wishes for all the Encouragement his Project deserves, I took my leave, and am at present tolerably quiet in my Study, not hav∣ing above two or three Alarms in a Day, which must be now and then expected from so vigorous and warm an Imagination.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Sixth Book of the <HI>Aeneid</HI> has always been a Favourite with me, for the noble Sen∣timents of Morality, and the inimitable Strain of Poetry which run through it. I frequently read it with the most transporting Pleasure, and, after finishing it, I cannot but look down very much upon the degenerate State of Poetry among the Moderns. For the strong nervous Thought and natural Expression, they have substituted pretty Conceit, quaint Phrases, Turns, Strokes, and I know not what, tending to a general De∣pravity of Taste among us. Filled with these Thoughts, I lately retired to rest, when <HI>Queen Mab</HI> immediately ap∣peared to me, and from the Mixture of Ideas fluctuating in my Mind, she dressed up the following Scene to my Imagination.</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="128"/>I thought she informed me, that the intellectual Re∣gions are divided into Districts similar to those of the Nether-world, so admirably described by the Poet; I then fansied that she commanded me to set out on a Journey through the Head of a modern Writer, which, I instantly agreed to, and the Goddess accordingly took me in her Chariot. In a short Time, we arrived at the Apartment, where the Bard sat, <HI>sicklied o'er with the pale Cast of Thought.</HI> At my first Approach towards the intellectual Regions, a terrible Effluvium "proceeding," as <HI>Shakespear</HI> has it, "from the Heat-oppressed Brain," struck my Senses; but I was soon diverted from that uneasy Sensation by a Personage, who offered to be my Guide. From a conscious Simper, a careless Disposi∣tion of his Person, and the Tenor of his Discourse, I knew him to be VANITY, and accepted the Compli∣ment. Our Way was through a thick Skull, of which we at once took Possession, and plunged into the Abyss.</P>
<P>At our first Entrance, a confused Noise assailed our Ears, and we were instantly beset by a Number of Phan∣toms placed around the Portal. The God <HI>Somnus</HI> lay stretched at full Length, diffusing round him lethargic Vapours and stupid Insensibility; a Group of wild <HI>Dreams</HI> and <HI>Reveries</HI> hovered over him, and at a small Distance flowed the River of <HI>animal Spirits,</HI> dull, slow, and lazy. Numbers were gathered round the Banks begging a Passage into this gloomy World, but the <HI>Charon</HI> of the Place, a torpid, decrepid Fellow, known there by the Name of PERCEPTION, gave a few of them a tardy Admittance, and to the greater Part he was entirely deaf. Among those, whom he rejected, I perceived a Train, which I took for the nine <HI>Muses,</HI> but was in∣formed they never had attempted to pass that Way, and upon a nearer View I found they were the amiable Band of <HI>moral Virtues,</HI> who were highly desirous of gaining Admittance, which was refused them, with the
<PB N="126" REF="129"/>Addition of as much Insolence in the Denial, as if they had been suing at a great Man's Door. They gave me to understand, that it is now become fashionable to discard them every where, at which I could not help expressing great Uneasiness; and I then advanced to∣wards the Boatman, PERCEPTION, who, with the Help of his Spectacles, at Length descried me, and received me into his Care.</P>
<P>The River had a great many Turnings and Windings (for <HI>ductile Dullness new Maeanders takes</HI>) but, after some Trouble, we at Length reached the opposite Bank. An uncultivated Tract lay before us, dreary, dark and gloomy; no Ray of Light to break through the Mist; impenetrable Obscurity involved the Scene, and Va∣pours rolling over Vapours made every Thing an univer∣sal Blot. I pursued my Journey with all possible Expe∣dition, and arrived at the <HI>Repository of Ideas,</HI> as it is here called, the Key of which was kept by MEMORY. As I supposed this to be a Store-house of universal Know∣ledge, I begged to be favoured with a View of the se∣veral Acquisitions he had made. I desired he would produce some <HI>occult Qualities,</HI> of which I had no Manner of Notion; and I called for several of the <HI>metaphysical Train</HI> too tedious to enumerate; in <HI>Divinity</HI> I remem∣bered several Things, of which I never could attain a clear Conception, and I have not Arithmetic enough to recount the Multitude of the <HI>Mathematical</HI> Species which I wanted; the Debates, which I have heard in <HI>Westminster-Hall,</HI> gave me occasion to enquire for many of the legal Band, and I was curious after an infinite Multitude of the <HI>Parnassian Tribe,</HI> mentioned in a pompous Stile in several modern Poets. I longed to see an <HI>en∣venomed Shaft, taking its fatal Aim, wind wafting Pray∣ers on rosy Wings to Heaven,</HI> &amp;c. I begged a Sight of <HI>Colley Cibber</HI>'s old Friend BATTLE ARRAY, and the many other Poetic Beings, which he and others of his
<PB N="127" REF="130"/>Brethren of the Quill, had created; but all to no Pur∣pose.</P>
<P>The next Place we came to was the <HI>Lugentes Campi,</HI> or the mournful Fields, sacred to <HI>Venus.</HI> I met with nothing here but <HI>Cupid</HI>'s Darts, consuming Fires, and all the modern Train of Love's Artillery. As I was sufficiently acquainted with these, from a constant and unwearied Perusal of our modern Tragedies and other poetical Productions, I hastened to the Seat, where JUDGMENT presided.</P>
<P>Judgment seldom made any Decisions of his own, but was biassed in all his Decrees by several that surrounded him, with so much Authority, that I supposed they were in the Commission. The Chief of these was PRIDE, with a lofty Air and supercilious Brow, which called to my Mind the excellent Remark in the Essay on Cri∣ticism;
<Q><L>Of all the Causes which conspire to blind</L>
<L>Man's erring Judgment, and misguide his Mind,</L>
<L>Which the weak Head with surest Biass rules,</L>
<L>Is <HI>Pride,</HI> the never-failing Vice of Fools.</L>
<BIBL><HI>POPE.</HI></BIBL></Q></P>
<P>Next in Place was ILL-NATURE, callous and hardened to every gentle Sensation of Humanity, and quite a Stranger to that Delicacy of elegant Minds, which be∣holds the Merit of another with Pleasure; but on the contrary, every Thing shining with the smallest Degree of Lustre is the Object of his Aversion, and he is never pleased but with the Misfortunes of his Neighbours. PREJUDICE also seemed to have no small Influence with the Court, and VENALITY, with itching Palm, fre∣quently gave a new Turn to every Thing, being ready to engage on either Side in Politicks, to abuse a worthy Character in Satire, or exalt a base one in dedicatory Panegyric.</P>
<P>From these Principles I could easily imagine to myself what Kind of Opinions were likely to arise, and there∣fore
<PB N="128" REF="131"/>hastened towards <HI>Elysium.</HI> In my Way, I perceived a desolate Tract, which may be called the Region of Tortures. Here I saw <HI>Grief, Despair, Envy, Revenge,</HI> and all the agonizing Cares, that made this Place worse, than what the Poets fable of their <HI>Tartarus.</HI> In one Part was to be seen <HI>Ambition</HI> falling back, like the Stone of <HI>Sisyphus;</HI> in another Place, <HI>Hunger</HI> was tantalized with the Hopes of a Supper, but the worst of Fiends, cruel <HI>Want</HI> forbids the Touch. Here stood a Pillory, with <HI>Defamation</HI> nailed to it by the Ears, there a Blanket stretched out, and a Bard going to be tossed in it.— Here a tumultuous Play-house at the Damnation of a Virgin Muse; the sneering Beaux in the Boxes display their false Teeth; the Pit rises enraged, the Gallery open-its rude Throats, and nothing is to be heard but <Q>throw him over—won't y' ha' some Orange Chips —won't y' ha' some Nonpareils—off the Stage, off,</Q> till at Length the Catcal Whizzes, and the poor Poet in the mean Time is ready to expire, and Pangs as bad as Hell t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rment him.</P>
<P>Had I all the Pens of all the Scriblers of the Age, I should not be able to relate every Occurrence in my Adventures, and I was by this Time admonished by my Guide, that we were arrived at the Seat of Happiness. Here we found <HI>Invention</HI> happy in a Review of all his airy Beings, that were fluttering round him in a va∣riegated Dress, pressing and crowding upon each other, as if to force a Passage into open Day. I stood for a Time wondering at this mighty Bustle, and then en∣quired what might be the Cause of it. To which IN∣VENTION, <Q>that bright Band which you behold so eagerly gathering about the Gates of Life, are the chosen Few, to whom <HI>Apollo</HI> has appointed a new Birth into the World, and they are now impatiently waiting till proper Bodies are prepared for them by those <HI>poetical Midwives,</HI> commonly called <HI>Booksellers.</HI> They were all in the Beginning wasted over by PERCEPTION,
<PB N="129" REF="132"/>whom you have seen, and were thence conveyed to the Repository of Ideas, in the Care of MEMORY, till in the various Course of human Contingencies, they are again called forth, and by my Skill, arranged in proper Order for their Appearance among the Sons of Men.</Q></P>
<P>Thus having said, he led me round the whole Extent of <HI>Elysium,</HI> gave me a compleat View of all his intellec∣tual Train, and at Length dismissed me through the Ivory Gate to breath the vital Air, to which I was highly pleased to find myself restored, and the Joy occasioned by this Reflection operated so strongly on my Spirits, that I felt myself in some Agitation, and was instantly wakened out of my Dream.</P>

<P>AS you are occasionally a Critic on Theatrical En∣tertainments, be pleased in your next Paper to take Notice of a Doubt among some Lawyers, <HI>viz.</HI> Whether Mr. <HI>Blakes</HI> coming on the Stage, in the new Piece of <HI>Harlequin Fortunatus,</HI> with an Hare and a Brace of <HI>Partridges,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Cook,</HI> in one of the Dances at the other House, appearing with a Gun and an Hare, are not liable to be prosecuted as unqualified Persons by the Game-Laws, and whether they are not obnoxious to the Association for preserving the Game.</P>

<P>I am not sufficiently acquainted with the Laws of Pantomime to know, whether its Design be to promote
<PB N="130" REF="133"/><HI>Virtue</HI> or <HI>Vice,</HI> and therefore cannot determine, whether encouraging the Breach of the Law is just, or otherwise, in this modern <HI>Species of the Drama:</HI></P>
<P>By Advices from several Routs in this Metropolis, we are informed, that the Beau monde has undergone within these few Years, a total Revolution, and that Love is entirely banished from every Bosom. The Men no longer mind how a Lady looks, but how she plays; instead of observing the Delicacy of her Shape, the Turn of her Face, and Elegance of her Features, they only consider how many Trumps she holds, how often she makes a Finesse, and "can ye one?" The Ladies on their Part, despise all Considerations of Health, Good Humour, and Good Sense in the Men, and their Chat has taken a different Turn. <Q>Lard I know that Gentleman,—saw him at Mrs. <HI>Quadrille</HI>'s Rout— bet Fifty Guineas on a Rubber, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q> Thus <HI>Cupid</HI> is grown mere Lumber, and Cards, it is to be appre∣hended, will thin the rising Generation, or produce a haggard, infirm, puny Race, to constitute, what is called, <HI>People of Fashion.</HI> The Advice of an eminent Satyrist, I think not amiss on this Occasion.</P>
<Q><L><HI>If Sin you must, take Nature for your Guide,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Love has some soft Excuse to sooth your Pride:</HI></L>
<L><HI>Ye fair apostates from Love's antient Pow'r,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Can nothing ravish but a golden Show'r?</HI></L>
<L><HI>Can Cards alone your glowing Fancy seize?</HI></L>
<L><HI>Must</HI> Cupid <HI>learn to</HI> Punt, <HI>e're he can please?</HI></L></Q>

<P><HI>Jack Oakstick</HI> was indicted for that he, on <HI>Saturday</HI> Night the 16th of <HI>February,</HI> went into the Middle Gal∣lery
<PB N="132" REF="135"/>at <HI>Drury-Lane</HI> Play-house, and from thence one Apple, Value a Farthing, on the Stage did fling to the great Annoyance of the Actors, and Disturbance of the Com∣pany. The Fact was proved by two undeniable Evi∣dences, who, being interrogated whether they had not the Freedom of the House, severally answered, that they had not, and added, that they did not even go in with an Order, and that their only Motive for appearing on the Occasion was, to bring to condign Punishment an Offender against the Respect and good Manners due to a public Assembly. Whereupon the Prisoner, being asked by the Court what he had to say for himself, made Answer that he was drunk, and, as he hoped to be saved, it was nothing but an innocent Frolick. GUILTY; upon which he was ordered to wait upon the Managers of the abovementioned Theatre to ask their Pardon for his Misbehaviour, and he was sentenced to drink but a Pint of Wine after his Dinner for the future. —</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Peter Jessamy</HI> was indicted for standing between the Scenes in such a Manner as to hurt the most pathetic Situations of the Drama. GUILTY; but it appearing to the Court, that it was not done with Malice prepense, but only with intent to display his Cloaths to the Ladies, he was dismissed without any other Punishment than a severe Reprimand, and an Order, that he should not be admitted behind the Scenes again without giving Se∣curity for his good Behaviour, of which Mr. <HI>Varney</HI> and Mr. <HI>Crudge</HI> are to take proper Notice.—</P>
<P><HI>Elizabeth,</HI> the Wife of <HI>John Gayless,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> was in∣dicted, for that she, not having the Love of her Husband before her Eyes, hath, for the Space of three Years past, obstinately, willfully, and urged on by the Instigation of a certain Fury called GAMING, addicted all her At∣tention to Cards, to the great pecuniary Detriment of her Husband, and the utter Extinction of all domestic Happiness, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="136"/>The Cause was opened by Counsellor <HI>Manly,</HI> who urged in a long Harangue, that it is an absolute Apostacy from all that can be counted elegant in the fair Sex, to spend a Life over a Pack of Cards; that such a Conduct can only serve to spoil their Complexions, disturb their Tempers, suppress the natural Affections, which alone can create conjugal Felicity; that it must inevitably put to flight the <HI>Loves</HI> and <HI>Graces,</HI> which would otherwise hover round them, and in their stead, surround them with a Band of <HI>Harpies,</HI> such as <HI>Suspicion, Mistrust, Vex∣ation, Disappointment,</HI> &amp;c. and that, in short, it must at last bring on such an Insensibility, as to render a Wo∣man capable of venturing a Daughter's Portion upon the turning up of a Die, and oblige her to surrender her lovely Person, in Case of Non-payment, upon an <HI>Habeas Corpus</HI> from the Court of <HI>Venus.</HI></P>
<P>After this, <HI>Betty Minnikin,</HI> Chambermaid to the Pri∣soner, was examined, and she deposed, as how her Mistress never went to Bed till Four or Five in the Morn∣ing, and that she had often heard her say, she actually thought the King of Clubs a much handsomer Man than her Husband.</P>

<P>—I'd have you to know Sir—that I scorn your Words—I've nothing to do with Fellows— though to be sure (in Tears) he does use me barbarously, and has taken no notice ever since he had his wicked Will of me.</P>
</SP>
<P><HI>James Ditto, Mercer,</HI> was sworn and deposed, that he had served the Lady ever since her Marriage, and that he knew no more of the Colour of her Money, than of the real Colour of her Face, though he was informed by her Husband, and he verily believed the same to be true, that she had been supplied occasionally with Money to discharge all her Bills.</P>
<STAGE><PB N="134" REF="137"/>The Defence.</STAGE>
<P>The <HI>Prisoner's Council</HI> proved to the Court, that their Client always preserved her Virtue, and that no Instance of Infidelity to the Marriage-Bed could be charged against her, even though she had been tempted by Lord <HI>Trumpabout,</HI> who offered to remit a considerable gaming Debt, for so small a Consideration as cuckolding her Husband; and upon this they rested their Defence.</P>
<P>To this it was replied by the Council for the Prosecu∣tion, that it is not enough for a Woman to preserve her Virtue, if she is insensible to Shame in every other Point, agreeably to the <HI>Statute 6th Young,</HI>
<Q><L><HI>Some modern Ladies think one Crime is all;</HI></L>
<L><HI>Can Women then no Way but backwards fall?</HI></L></Q> Lord <HI>Townley</HI>'s Case was also cited, by which it appeared a Matter of Indifference, whether a Man be cuckolded by a <HI>black Ace,</HI> or a powdered Beau. Whereupon the Jury, without withdrawing, brought in their Verdict, GUILTY, and the Prisoner was ordered into the close Custody of her Husband, to be by him carried into the Country for twelve Months, there to read the <HI>Spectator, Tatler</HI> and <HI>Guardian,</HI> and never suffered to revisit <HI>London</HI> without proper Security for her good Behaviour.</P>
<P><HI>John Cockney</HI> was indicted at the Suit of Mrs. <HI>Seesaw,</HI> for that he, as a Servant to the said Mrs. <HI>Seesaw,</HI> be∣haved ill in his Place, by several Misdemeanors, such as not answering when called, nor shutting the Room-Door after him, and, when bid, doing it in such a Manner, as to shake the whole House, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The Fact being proved, the Prisoner was asked, what he had to say in Mitigation of his Offence; to which he replied, <Q>I does not want to live with the Lady—I have often bid her discharge me—She keeps but seven Card-Tables—and what can a poor Servant do, if he gets no more Vails nor that?—It is not the Pay of a Country Curate—Lord bless her, she may get
<PB N="135" REF="138"/>some raw Boy to live with her, but it won't do for me</Q>—Upon this the Jury declared him GUILTY; and the Court directed Mrs. <HI>Seesaw</HI> to discharge him without a Character, giving her at the same Time an Hint to keep fewer Card Tables for the future.</P>
<P><HI>William Dactyle</HI> was indicted, for that he hath fre∣quently been, during the Winter Season, at the <HI>Bedford</HI> Coffee-house, and then and there for a Dish of Coffee did call, or for <HI>red Tea,</HI> or <HI>Capillaire,</HI> as his Fancy di∣rected, and did afterwards steal out of the Back-Door, without paying for the same, to the Prejudice of the House, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

<P>Upon which the <HI>Attorney General</HI> of the Court opened the Cause in a long Speech, setting forth, that such Be∣haviour argues a depraved Mind, insensible to Truth, and wantonly derighting in giving Uneasiness to the
<PB N="137" REF="140"/>Fair Sex, by making many of them imagine he had honourable Intentions, when, at the same Time, he only meant, in the End, to break off to their Disappoint∣ment and Confusion.</P>

<STAGE>Miss <HI>Saffron,</HI> sworn on her Pocket Looking Glass.</STAGE>
<P>I met the Prisoner at the Bar at <HI>Enfield</HI> Assembly, where I danced with him till Two in the Morning; he squeezed my Hand several Times, called me his Angel, and "I protest, Miss <HI>Saffron,</HI>" says he, <Q>you have the finest Neck in the World.</Q> I was so far misled by this Speech, that I have ever since gone without an Handkerchief; he visited me next Morning, and gave me strong Reasons to expect Proposals for Marriage. But instead of that, I have been the <HI>Laughing-stock</HI> of all my Acquaintances ever since, for shewing the Yellowness of my Skin, and I never saw the Prisoner since till now.</P>

<P>I danced with the Prisoner at <HI>Hamstead.</HI> Assembly; I was at that Time upon a Treaty of Marriage with my Father's Prentice, which I broke off on his Account; and I have since rejected many very eligible Offers, en∣couraged by the Prisoner's Promises, in Consequence of which I bought me a new Gown at <HI>Carr, Ibson</HI>'s and <HI>Bigg</HI>'s, and now I find I'm not likely to be a bit the better for it.</P>

<P>May it please this Honourable Court, I am a Beau, and in order to support that Character, I thought it would not be amiss to have a few Treaties of Marriage de∣pending, though, at the same Time, I protest, I have no Attachment to any one breathing except myself.</P>
</SP>
<P>Upon this the Prisoner rested his Cause, and the Jury, without retiring, brought in their <HI>Verdict, a Male Jilt,</HI> and the Court adjudged, upon the Statute of <HI>Isaac Bicker∣staff,</HI> that no Lady whatever should admit the Addresses of <HI>John Vainlove,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> unless he could produce a Cha∣racter from the Lady he last served, testifying that, <HI>he behaved well in her Service.</HI></P>
<P>Lady <HI>Tittle-Tattle</HI> was indicted, for that she went fre∣quently to one or other of the two Theatres, and there, placing herself in a Side-Box as near the Stage as pos∣sible, talked louder than the Actors, even though a <HI>Gar∣rick,</HI> or a <HI>Barry,</HI> a <HI>Cibber</HI> or a <HI>Pritchard</HI> were Principal in the Scene. The Prisoner, instead of denying the Fact, insisted upon her Right to behave in that Manner, alledging it was what she always did at Church, and truly she could never be made to hold her Tongue in her Life. Verdict, GUILTY; upon which the Court was going to pass Sentence that she should lose her Tongue, but one of the Judges recollecting an Instance in <HI>Ovid,</HI> where the remaining Roots and Fibres retain their Ac∣tivity, <HI>Radix micat ultima linguae,</HI> objected to the Punish∣ment, insisting upon it, that it would not cure the Disease, and though no articulate Accents could be pro∣duced, <HI>nec vox nec verba sequuntur,</HI> yet such Sounds might issue, as would still continue to annoy the Com∣pany; she was therefore required to give Bail for her good Behaviour for the future, which she found difficult to do, as her Husband, for Reasons best known to him∣self, refused to be one; at length Mr. <HI>Hoyle</HI> became her Security, he being in Possession of the only Charm which can for a while stop the female Tongue.</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="142"/><HI>Bob Riot</HI> was indicted, for that he, in a full Gallery at <HI>Drury-Lane</HI> Play-house, cried out Fire. The Fact being incontestibly proved, but no one being able positively to swear to the Man, the strongest Evidence amounting to no more than I believe it is he, and I think it is the same Voice, he was acquitted.</P>
<P><HI>William Quibble</HI> was indicted for picking a Gentleman's Pocket of a Silk Handkerchief, Value Three Shillings.

<P><HI>Joseph Indolent</HI> was indicted, for that he murdered all his Time every Evening at the <HI>Bedford</HI> Coffee-House.

<PB N="140" REF="143"/>"half a Pit"—ay, as usual, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Upon which the Jury, without going out of Court, brought in their Verdict, WILFUL MURDER; but the Prisoner seeming to have a very sensible Feeling of his Condition, the Court, in hopes he might by this be awakened into Re∣flection, allowed him <HI>Benefit of Clergy,</HI> which they as∣sured him was the only Thing that could redeem him from Destruction, and therefore they recommended to him to read four Hours every Day for the future.</P>
<P><HI>William Clumsy</HI> was indicted, for that he walked about the Room at the <HI>Bedford</HI> Coffee-House, for near half an Hour every Evening, and trod fre∣quently upon Peoples Toes to the great Annoyance of Mrs. <HI>Michell</HI>'s Customers.

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>O endeavour at some Degree of Self-Know∣ledge, was the constant Advice of the ethic Writers among the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Romans;</HI> and this Precept we find inculcated by each of them in Terms that come home to every Man's Breast. Among the Moderns, my Lord <HI>Shastsbury,</HI> has more particularly enforced the Doctrine to the Race of Writers, and has recommended this intuitive Intercourse to every Author, by desiring him frequently to enter into a <HI>Soliloquy</HI> with himself; by which Means he will probably stand informed, whether he can boast that in∣tellectual Harmony, which is requisite for the Formation of a tasteful Mind; whether he is sufficiently acquainted with the Progress of the human Understanding, the se∣cret Movements of the Heart, the Grace of Character, the Beauty of Virtue, and all those elegant Refinements of Thinking, without which it is impossible to reach any Degree of Excellence in a Composition. We likewise find that <HI>Boileau,</HI> the famous <HI>French</HI> Satyrist, was aware of the Necessity of this spiritual Retreat (if I may be allowed to call it so) and accordingly he has entered into a Review of himself in his ninth Satire, which is certainly as pleasant a Piece of Humour and Raillery, as ever was produced by any Writer antient or modern. The Poet addresses himself to his own Mind, by saying,
<PB N="143" REF="146"/>that he wants to hold a little private Conversation with that internal Agent, whom he had too long encouraged in Whims and Frolicks, by an indolent Indulgence; and, now that his Patience is provoked to the utmost, he will, once for all, tell him his own.

<L><HI>Une fois en ma vie, il fant vous dire tout.</HI></L></Q> In Conformity to the Injunction of the noble Writer, and in Imitation of the sensible and polite Satyrist, just quoted, I have lately divided myself into two Persons, in order to examine my inward Frame, the Motives of my Actions, the secret Spring of my Writings, and to attain a more int mate Knowledge of my several Foibles, my various Humours, and the whimsical Vicissitudes of my Passions. The Dialogue was carried on with great Warmth on both Sides, as if there was really an intestine War within me. As I am willing to disclose myself, as well as to dissect any other Character, that occurs to me in my Rambles, for the more effectual Improvement or Entertainment of my Readers, I shall lay the whole <HI>Drama,</HI> before them this Day. The candid, I am con∣vinced, will pardon all such Errors, as arise from the Imbecillity of human Nature, and the Enemies of the Author (if he has any) will abate from their Inveteracy, when they perceive that timorous Self love cannot pre∣vail upon him to conceal his own Infirmities.</P>

<P>—Come, my Soul, or whatever you are, that actuate this Machine; you and I have long been
<PB N="144" REF="147"/>wrangling, and I desire now to have a private Conse∣rence with you, Pray, what could put it into your Head to make me turn Writer?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Soul.</SPEAKER>
<P>How can you ask me such a Question? You know my original Motive was to make as much waste Paper, as the Rest of the Scribblers of the Age. The Town began early to take Notice of my Undertaking, and so the Amusement of it, and a Principle of Gra∣titude induced me to persevere.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ranger.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let me tell you, that you are a busy, prag∣matical, intermeddling, foolish Kind of a Being, and when once you take a Fancy into your Head, there is no such Thing as reasoning with you. Did not I repre∣sent to you that Writing is a State of Warfare upon Earth, and that the most candid and unassuming Ex∣pression will not secure a Man from secret poisoned Arrows while Malice and Envy, and Ill-nature are such predominant Vices in Mankind?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Soul.</SPEAKER>
<P>True; but did not I always answer you, that the wise and good will not become Tools to a Party, and that they will never condescend to do the dirty Work of Calumny and Detraction? A public Writer, who is attended with a Degree of Success, must expect to be attacked by Scribblers, and let me tell you, Mr. <HI>Ranger,</HI> you are an errant Blockhead, if you ever suffer any of them to ruffle your Temper. Take my Advice, and laugh at the Impotence of Malice; and whenever any one attempts to wound you with the Weapons of Falsehood, smile at the Dart, which, short of its Aim, falls harmless at your Feet, and repeat with me from my favourite <HI>Virgil,</HI>

<SPEAKER>Soul.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not so fast in your Career; Pray, Sir, have not you brought all this upon yourself? what Business had you to discover the Author? Prejudices will una∣voidably arise, against a known Writer. But you must go and consult with a few of your Friends, before the Work was commenced; and what was the Consequence? Did they assist you? They only whispered it about, and in a Month's Time, you were known every where. I often told you, you are of too open a Temper. Observe how some People lock up their Minds in Company; Snug's the Word; not a Syllable from their Lips, and they make Use of all they can extract from your com∣municative Disposition. Look ye, if you would but keep my Secrets a little closer, I don't in the least doubt but we should succeed much better. Don't be quite so precipitate, and let us take Time to plan, to alter, to touch, and retouch, and I'll stake my Immortality, that we go on with more Safety and Ease. Or, if you must take the Opinion of People, ask it of those only who have both Inclination and Capacity to serve you, Learn to distinguish between Men.</P>

<P>Gad, its pleasant enough to see you as∣sume the Air of a Dictator, and take upon you to reform Men and Manners, to correct vitiated Taste, to offer your Criticisms on fine Writings, give Rules for Style, reprobate a Profusion of Metaphors and flowery Epithets, and ridicule the Foibles of Mankind. I tell you, we are too young for the Task; do you feel within you the Emotions of a sublime Spirit? Have your pervading Eyes searched every Subject to the Bottom? Had not
<PB N="146" REF="149"/>you better employ yourself in reading the best Authors, ancient and modern, than spinning out from yourself? Has <HI>Apollo</HI> opened to you the Secrets of <HI>Parnassus?</HI> And then don't I know your Method of Proceeding? Don't you some Times defer Things to the last Day, and don't you let Inaccuracies escape from you, which a little Time would inform you want Correction?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Soul.</SPEAKER>
<P>There I allow you hit me; but the Nature of periodical Writings must admit some slight Inadverten∣cies. The Dissipations of Pleasure, and a thousand other Avocations must inevitably disconcert a Person at Times; and then one is not always in the same Humour. But why don't you take care to correct the Press? When you should be attending to that necessary Trouble, you are often running about the Town, which is no Excuse to the Reader. For my Part, I flatter myself that the best Judges will allow for an youthful Enterprize, and in a more advanced Period, and at more Leisure, I pos∣sibly may repay them for their present Indulgence.</P>

<P>Why, you are sensible, that my Paper is cal∣culated for a Multiplicity of Readers; some like one Thing, some another; there is no pleasing all at once, Besides, there is a Performer on the Stage, who has, upon many Occasions, surprized me with new Lights in Pas∣sages that were before obscure, and who has often had an irresistible Power over my Passions.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Stoic Philosophy was by many of the Antients esteemed the Height of human Wisdom, the sure Road to Happiness, and the last Finishing and Apotheosis of an ex∣alted Character. Its Excellence consisted, not in the due Government of the Passions, but in extirpating them totally from the human Heart; by which means the Seat of feeling, and Source of every exquisite Plea∣sure, as well as tender Pain, was rendered quite cal∣lous and insensible, and suffered to move only with the Flux and Reflux of the Blood, without being agitated with any Kind of Sensation whatever. Our excellent Poet has given us a very picturesque Description of this notable System of Philosophy.</P>
<Q><L><HI>In lazy Apathy let Stoics boast</HI></L>
<L><HI>Their Virtue fix'd; 'tis fix'd as in a Frost,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Contracted all retiring to the Breast;</HI></L>
<L><HI>But Strength of Mind is Exercise, not Rest.</HI></L></Q>
<P>How an absolute Repugnance to the Laws of Nature, and the Want of those Feelings, which are the best In∣gredients in our Composition, can in any Way consti∣tute an exalted Character I am at a loss to determine. <HI>Vita secundum Naturam,</HI> a Life conformable to the Laws of Nature, is <HI>Tully</HI>'s Definition of a moral, as well as an happy State. Certain it is, all Elegance of Mind,
<PB N="150" REF="153"/>and Relish for Virtue, must arise from those Sen∣sations, which Nature has implanted in us, as Ex∣citements to Action, and Inlets for due Degrees of Plea∣sure and Pain. Without these, our most refined Gra∣tifications must suffer a considerable Abatement; the pleasing Anxieties of virtuous Friendship, the grateful Solicitude of Love, the melancholy Luxury of tender Compassion, and the Delights which we derive from a well-wrought Scene of Distress in an affecting Tragedy, must all lose their Influence, and the Mind sink into a dull State of Insensibility. For my Part, I have always had a sovereign Contempt for the unfeeling, pedantic Wisdom of those unnatural Followers of a brutal Phi∣losophy; nor could I ever admire their ridiculous Osten∣tation of a towering Superiority of Soul. That this is also the Sense of the greater Part of Mankind, is very visible from that soporific Awe, with which they behold Personages of this Cast, when interwoven into the Drama; while Characters of a mixed Nature, in whom the Pas∣sions are in a beautiful Struggle between Virtue and Vice, are always sure to seize the Affections of an Au∣dience, and interest every Heart in the Fortunes of the Hero thus represented.</P>
<P><HI>Virgil</HI> has transmitted to us a Picture of the Comple∣tion of that Happiness, which was the exalted Boast of the Stoics: In the Words of my Motto, he tells us, that the Person, whom he describes in the Possession of true Felicity, is never touched with popular Esteem, or the dazling Splendor of the regal State; that Difference between Brothers, Conspiracies against his Country, or the Decline of the Constitution, never disturb his Breast; nor is he ever made uneasy by Compassion for the Indi∣gent, or Envy towards the great. This is a Cha∣racter totally different from the amiable Sketch, by his Brother Poet, of the Man who considers the Relations in which he stands to Society, and feels for all Mankind. The negative Enjoyments above described can result
<PB N="151" REF="154"/>from nothing but an absolute Indifference to our Fellow-Creatures, and is so far from being commendable, that, in my Opinion, it is equalled by every Debauchee in Town. I was lately in Company with one of this Class, who appeared to me to be a very great Proficient in the Stoic Philosophy, and to have carried into his Practice, every Branch of the foregoing System, and as a further Instance of the Excellence of the Stoic School, I shall here present my Readers with a Character of a modern Stoic Philosopher.</P>
<P><HI>Jack Wildair</HI> is possessed of a Fortune, which might enable him to live with Splendor, or to prosecute any Enterprize in the Service of his Country; he has also the Advantages of Birth, to render him reputable in the Eye of the World; but like a true Philosopher he never placed any Value upon these happy Circumstances. With a noble Contempt for Riches, he squanders away his Substance in a Manner which shews him to be above the mean Ambition of popular Applause; and, instend of being arrogantly elated with the Thoughts of his high Birth, he has been known to associate with the lowest of Mankind, so superior is he to those little Sen∣sations of Pride which might be apt to play about the Heart of a Man of worldly Vanity. Contented in his own Mind, he never condescended to court the Favour of his Countrymen at an Election for Member of Parlia∣ment. The <HI>populi Fasces</HI> have never had any Attrac∣tion for <HI>Jack Wildair,</HI> and so little is he touched with the Splendor of Majesty, that he does not care for any King in <HI>Europe.</HI> While all our Politicians have made the two <HI>Brothers</HI> the constant Object of their Attention, he is little sollicitous whether there be a Difference be∣tween them or not. The Fortifications of <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> the Depredations of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in the <HI>West-Indies</HI> upon our Merchantmen, the Election of the King of the <HI>Romans,</HI> the Equipment of <HI>French</HI> Fleets, and all the other Points of Moment, which engross the Thoughts
<PB N="152" REF="155"/>of our present Race of Patriots, never once discomposed the Serenity of his Mind. Liberty and Property are to him unideal Sounds, and if <HI>Magna Charta</HI> were burned by the common Hangman, it would not occasion the least Gloom in our Hero's Soul. He can also behold the Distresses of the Indigent, the corroding Anxieties of Poverty, most Stoic like, without a single Sigh. <HI>Nec doluit miserans inopem;</HI> and so far from being envious of another's Superiority in Life, while he is easy himself, he never was yet known to compare his own Situation with any Man above him, though he has now and then condescended to cast a Look beneath him, with no small Degree of Satisfaction.</P>
<P>Nor does the Firmness of <HI>Wildair</HI>'s Mind rest here. He can visit all the Brothels in this Metropolis, with∣out feeling the least Degree of Uneasiness. He can be∣hold, undisturbed by any of those tender Touches, which might agitate weaker Breasts, an elegant Form, and the most beautiful Set of Features falling a Prey to <HI>Insamy, Diseases,</HI> and <HI>Prostitution;</HI> and as the antient Wor∣thies thought it a noble Atchievement totally to forget the Man, in order to raise their philosophic Fame to an higher Degree of Eminence, so our modern Stoic can fat press the natural Affections, and in the Rake he can also forget the Man. <HI>Jack Wildair</HI> is a very <HI>Roman</HI> in that Point; he is an excellent Practitioner of <HI>Horace</HI>'s golden Rule, to admire nothing; and, if confined to the Ped of Sickness, to repair the Waste made by Folly and Intemperance, he is sure to spend his Time in a Series of moral Reflections. He wisely observes, that all Plea∣sure is fugitive; that the Reversion of Pain falls to every Man's Lot; and that the Condition of human Life is frail and uncertain. When his Health returns, he in∣dulges in all the Sallies of his wild Imagination, to shew, that, like <HI>Aristippus,</HI> he can adapt himself to every Situation. In short, <HI>Jack Wildair</HI> has upon all Occa∣sions a true Philosophical Turn; and indeed in all Oc∣currences
<PB N="153" REF="156"/>of Life every Thing is sure to suggest to him those Reflections, which are most conducive to secure his own Happiness, to prevent the ruffled State arising from conflicting Passions, to preserve the even Tenor of his Thoughts, to reconcile him to himself, and enable him to possess his Soul in Ease, Tranquility, and Chearful∣ness.</P>
<P>This Character of a modern Town Philosopher con∣tains, in my Opinion, all the Branches of the much boasted stoic System, and all the leading Principles of Happiness, which it inculcates, are carried by our mo∣dern Academic to a much greater Height of Wisdom and Felicity, than they ever were by the most rigid Follower of the stoic Academy, in so much as the modern Hero grafts his Happiness on the Passions, which he plays against one another, and in that Sense may be said to live <HI>secundum naturam;</HI> whereas the antient Stoic endeavoured to subvert the very Elements of our being, and among that Sect, he was the most exalted Worthy, who was the most divested of Humanity.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE pantomime Poet, from whom I some Time ago felt a little Interruption in my Studies, has remained in the Chambers o∣ver my. Head ever since; but, the Fervour of his Enthusiasm being a good deal abated, he has proved a very peaceable and quiet Neighbour. For though he cannot entirely refrain from his peripatetic Lucubrations, he is, however, careful to conduct them with a Degree of Temperance, and he now proves a Companion of very singular and entertaining Oddities. The other Morning he paid me a Visit, and was con∣tented in the Beginning to converse with me upon com∣mon and ordinary Topics, upon which he discoursed with sufficient Sedateness. At length he took occasion to introduce the Subject which was the Cause of his Visit, and I observed, that the Moment he touched up∣on his favourite Scheme of Thinking, he betrayed se∣veral whimsical Gestures, and an extraordinary Manner of Address. <Q>Sir, says he, I have taken the Liberty to intrude upon you this Morning, in order to consult you in Relation to a Work, which I have had in Hand for some Time past, and which I think cannot fail to be of public Utility, as it is one of the De∣siderata in Literature, and a Species of Criticism likely to be productive of singular Advantages to the learned World. The Thing I mean, Sir, is THE ART OF PANTOMIME, which I propose to publish by Sub∣scription, not noubting but I shall meet with suitable
<PB N="156" REF="159"/>Encouragement to prosecute so arduous a Task, and if Mr. <HI>Ranger</HI> will be kind enough to favour me with his Recommendation, I shall for the future e∣steem him, as a generous Promoter of the polite Arts.</Q></P>
<P>In order to be able to comply with my Friend's Request, and to serve him as effectually as my small Abilities will permit me, I desired him to explain to me at large the Plan of his Undertaking, and the whole Method, which he had chalked out to himself for so noble a Work. Upon which I was informed, that he intends to execute his Design, in Imitation of <HI>Aristotle</HI>'s <HI>Art of Poetry,</HI> divided into as many Sections, and, as near as the Nature of the Subject will admit, comprized under the same Heads. His first Chapter is to set out with an Account of the imitative Arts, in which Pan∣tomime will be proved to be superior to all the Rest, having the greatest Variety of Gesticulation, and the most expressive Significance in all its Attitudes and Actions. In the next Section, it will appear what Sort of Persons and Things are proper for Imitation, and that the Pantomime Poet must either attach himself to the Representation of Personages above the ordinary Race of human Nature, such as Magicians, Enchanters, Genii, Gods, Imps, and Monsters, Devils, Furies, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> or to the Exhibition of Characters to be met with in the ordi∣nary Occurrences of Life, such as we find introduced in <HI>Harlequin Ranger.</HI> Then follows a Dissertation upon the proper Manner of imitating, and Enquiry into the Origin of Pantomime, tracing it from the Time of <HI>Herace</HI> down to the glorious Time of Mahomet <HI>Carathra.</HI></P>
<P>After this, our Author proceeds to examine into the Nature of <HI>Farces,</HI> and shows how they differ from the <HI>Pantomime.</HI> He then enters more minutely into the Laws of <HI>Pantomime,</HI> and gives an Account of it's seve∣ral Parts. Among these the Fable is first considered, and it is allowed, it may be either simple or implex. He does
<PB N="157" REF="160"/>not totally reject the former, but insists principally upon the Beauties of the complicated Plot, such as <HI>Harlequin Sorcerer,</HI> or the Loves of <HI>Pluto</HI> and <HI>Proserpine; Harlequin Fortunatus</HI> being of the simple Kind, consisting of one Action only, impeded or accelerated by several Inci∣dents, all tending in a direct Line to the Completion of the Whole.</P>
<P>The refined Beauties of the Art offer themselves next, and our Author exhausts all his Erudition, all his Rhe∣toric, and all his whole Stock of Criticism, to point out the Advantages arising to a Piece from a well conducted <HI>Peripetia,</HI> which he defines in these Words. <Q>The pan∣tomimical <HI>Peripetia</HI> consists in sudden Changes of For∣tune, arising from a Concatenation of Incidents high∣ly improbable in their Nature.</Q> Then the <HI>Agnitio</HI> is displayed at large, and proved to be the liveliest Beauty in this Species of the Drama, it being a sudden Recol∣lection in the Personages of the Piece, when, after a long Absence, they recognize, and know each other again. As when <HI>Harlequin</HI> finds Access to his <HI>Co∣lombine</HI> in a disguised Appearance, she by some Token discovers her Lover, and is happy in his Embrace.</P>
<P>After having enforced these striking Particulars, he de∣livers Rules for the Excitement of Terror, Pity, and the Marvellous. The two former he mentions but slightly, not thinking them essential in these Compositions, but in the Marvellous, he observes, consists the utmost Effort of human Genius, and then enumerates the various Means by which it is excited, such as flying Mercurys, Rope-Dancers, Kicking Straws, Children playing on the Flute, Storms of Rain, Thunder and Lightening, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The next Division of the Work, relates to the Man∣ners of each Personage of the Drama, in which he re∣commends a serious Attention to Character, in order the more forcibly to unfold Men and Manners, and the Customs, the Intrigues, the Flights and Descents of the
<PB N="158" REF="161"/>Gods, with the whole History of the Heathen Mytho∣logy. In this Part of the Work he expatiates at large upon the Use of Machinery, and I make no Doubt, will greatly excel the celebrated <HI>Bossu</HI> in this Part of the Performance. Having the Interests of the Theatre greatly at Heart, our Author proves, that no Play-house can long subsist without a good Set of Carpenters, an expeditious Band of Scene-Drawers, excellent Candle-Snuffers, Fire-Eaters, Trap-Door-Men, Ostriches, Monkeys, Serpents, and the whole animal World, be∣sides a Race of Beings never seen upon the Face of the Earth.</P>
<P>The Sentiment comes into Consideration in the fol∣lowing Chapter. The several Modes of the Mind are explained in an ample Manner, and Directions given to the Performer to render himself perfectly acquainted with the Operation of all the Passions on the whole Frame of the Body, and it is laid down as a Rule that he must be careful to mark the different Actions of Begging Commanding, Threatning, Interrogating, Answering, that he may be able to impress a lively Idea of each up∣on the Minds of his Spectators.</P>
<P>The Sentiment being established, the Diction claims our next Regard. Under this Head the several pretty Pieces of Poetry introduced into <HI>Pantomimes</HI> are criti∣cised, and proper Rules prescribed for Writing these Kind of Nonsense—Verses. To the whole Work is an∣nexed a particular Examen of <HI>Harlequin Fortunatus,</HI> in order to give a Specimen of the great Utility and Truth of the foregoing Rules. I shall therefore conclude this Paper with an Abstract from this Part of the Work.</P>
<P>There cannot, says my Author, be sound in any Pan∣tomime Writer a better imagined Opening for the Drama, than the first Incident in this Piece. The Scene discovers a large Wood, in which the poor, forlorn Har∣lequin is wandering, in a violent Storm of Rain, Thun∣der and Lightening. In a Fit of Desperation he throws
<PB N="159" REF="162"/>himself on the Ground, and to heighten our Compas∣sion poor Madam <HI>Fortune</HI> is introduced bemoaning her Condition in a very pathetic Strain of Poetry. The ami∣able Character of <HI>Fortunatus</HI> is seen in his Readiness to assist the distressed, and the Sequel conveys a fine Moral, <HI>viz.</HI> that Riches, Riot, and Debauchery are the most desirable Things in this World, as the Piece ends with Harlequin's being in the full Enjoyment of all his Wishes. The Farmer's Yard affords a pleasing Image of rural Happiness, and the beautiful Incident of the Dog's biting the Clown conveys this Incident, that a Dog's obeyed in Office, and it serves further to enforce the Necessity of an Act of Parliament to lessen the Number of Dogs, which over-run the Kingdom, to the great Annoyance of his Majesty's loyal Subjects. The fre∣quent Remembrances between <HI>Columbine</HI> and her <HI>Har∣lequin</HI> make upon all Occasions an admirable <HI>Agnitio,</HI> and the sudden Changes of their Fortunes form a very beautiful <HI>Peripetia.</HI> Harlequin's Escape into the Oven, his running up the Chimney, and his Leap over the Gateway, when his Enemies are in close Pursuit of him, are all Touches of the highest Elevation and Genius, and upon the whole, we may say with Mr. <HI>Dennis,</HI> that this Piece is admirable for its fine Moralities, its Uni∣versality, and its Integrity.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> Had the Honour, in one of my former Pa∣pers, of introducing my Readers into that celebrated Academy of Arts and Sciences, THE ROBIN HOOD SOCIETY, which con∣tinues in as flourishing a Condition as ever. Last <HI>Mon∣day</HI> I was so happy as to attend the Debates of this learned Body, and with Pleasure I reflected, that the Seat of Investigation, Knowledge, and Sense is now likely to be fixed in BUTCHER-ROW. In Imitation of <HI>Spratt</HI>'s History of the Royal Society, I have some Thoughts of collecting together the Annals of this re∣spectable Assembly, the Members of which have nothing so much at Heart, as the Discovery of Truth, inso∣much that it is common to hear a bare-footed Shoemaker settle a Point in Philosophy; a Taylor in Rags prove, that a <HI>Remnant of all shall be saved;</HI> an Attorney bring his Writ of Error against Revelation; a <HI>Philomath</HI> from <HI>Aberdeen</HI> confute the established Religion and an in∣solvent Tradesman, chiefly sollicitous about the na∣tional Debt. In short, such a Spirit of Free Enquiry reigns in this Seminary, that you may see Journeymen-Barbers, Hackney-Clerks, Porters, Chairmen, Hack∣ney-Coachmen, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</HI> all actuated with a no∣ble Enthusiasm, and by Turns pleading for Rewards and Punishments, the Existence or Non-Existence of a Deity, the moral Fitness of Things, the eternal Rule of Right, and in half an Hour they are <HI>Shaftsburians, Hutchensonians, Mandevillians, Muggletonians, Theists, A∣theists,</HI> &amp;c. During the Course of their Researches the
<PB N="162" REF="165"/>Students are frequently observed to make such vigorous Application to certain Pewter Pots lying before them, and to draw from thence such copious Draughts, that it is by many imagined the Academy has found out, that the Ancients were mistaken, when they supposed TRUTH to be in the Bottom of a Well; this coy and retired Goddess, in the Opinion of the <HI>Robin Hood</HI> So∣ciety, being to be found at present in the Bottom of a <HI>Pot of Porter.</HI> Be that as it may, certain it is, the noble System of Free-thinking is here displayed in it's genuine Lustre, as, I fancy, will appear from the following De∣bate, with which I shall fill up the Remainder of this Day's Paper.</P>

<P>Pray, Gentlemen, be silent.

Mr. <HI>Manly,</HI> it is now with you, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Manly.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I am against Operas, for this ca∣pital Reason; <HI>viz.</HI> because most of them are composed by People ignorant of the first Principle of Composi∣tion, which is <HI>Counterpoint,</HI> or the Art of placing dif∣ferent Notes, sounding together in true harmonic Or∣der. Musick, Sir, consists of <HI>Melody</HI> and <HI>Harmony. Me∣lody</HI> is the regular Progression of a single Part; and <HI>Har∣mony,</HI> of different Parts united. Now the <HI>Melody</HI> of all the Songs in our late <HI>Italian</HI> Operas is extravagant and unnatural, consequently unpleasing, and sitter for Instruments than Voices. Their Singers are constantly endeavouring to surprize, by which Means, their Songs are all Quirks and Divisions, and the Performers are
<PB N="167" REF="170"/>sometimes squeaking like Cats at the Top of a House, and sometimes growling like Dogs in a Cellar. The Energy of the Words is totally neglected, and the Pas∣sion is entirely lost; and therefore I cannot help won∣dering, that, while we have <HI>Handel, Arne, Boyce,</HI> and <HI>Smith,</HI> &amp;c. the <HI>English</HI> will lavish Sums upon a false and depraved Taste, merely to be thought Judges of what they do not understand. I shall finish, Sir, with asserting, that an elegant <HI>Drama,</HI> by a good Au∣thor, and the Music composed by either of the Masters mentioned already, might be a high and rational En∣tertainment; it would certainly save an immense Sum to the Nation, and would excite some new Genius's to study, and excel all other Nations, in manly, sensible Compositions, where the Sound would be an Echo to the Sense, and the Passions would be agitated by the joint Power of Poetry and Harmony.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>President.</SPEAKER>
<P>Gentlemen, it is now too late, and so I wish you all a Good-night. <HI>Adjourned.</HI></P>

<Q>Mendici, Mimi, Balatrones, hoc Genus omne.
<BIBL><HI>HOR.</HI></BIBL></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HERE is not a Word, in the whole Com∣pass of the <HI>English</HI> Language, more grosly abused than the Term <HI>Friendship,</HI> which, at present, means no more than that Men eat together, walk together, game together, und are grave and merry, drunk and sober together, without ever conceiving any real Regard for each others Hap∣piness and Interest. I believe every Day's Experience will point out many, who are Dupes to this florid Out∣side
<PB N="168" REF="171"/>of Friendship. In the Course of my Observation I have marked out a particular Character that falls more egregiously into this Error, than the rest of Mankind. The Character I mean is that of THE COMICAL FEL∣LOW, or THE AGREEABLE DEVIL, or THE CURSED HIGH FELLOW, or THE MAN OF INFINITE HU∣MOUR, or THE GENIUS, or by whatever Name (for many Names will suit him) you may please to distinguish the Person, whom a cheerful Flow of Spirits, and a quick Circulation of the Ideas, that fall to his Share, conspire to render an entertaining Com∣panion.</P>
<P>The COMICAL FELLOW, is in high Request among all his Acquaintance; and different Parties at the <HI>Shake∣spear,</HI> the <HI>Bedford-Arms,</HI> the <HI>King's-Arms,</HI> &amp;c. are vying with each other to have him the Master of the Joke in their convivial Parties, because he is without Doubt the finest Creature in the World to kill an Hour with, the merry Droll has such Variety of Chat, and such a deal of Humour in telling a Story. But while this Son of Gaiety and Wit is thus happy in the Caresses of all the Lovers of Mirth, this secret Misfortune attends him, that he has not any where procured himself the least Degree of Esteem, because it is too well known, that he has not a single Virtue under the Sun, that he would at any Time, according to the common Saying, rather lose his Friend than his Joke, that no Obligation can bind him, but that indiscriminately he lashes all alike, and is constantly upon the look out for some Incident, which by a Perversion of Circumstances, or by a few Touches of Mimickry, or some other adventitious Aid, may be worked up into a Story for the Entertainment of the next Company he goes into. On this Account THE AGREEABLE DEVIL is held in utter Contempt; but the Vivacity of his Imagination will not afford him Leisure to attend to this; his Vanity is fully gratified by the general Applause he meets with, and he is con∣stantly
<PB N="169" REF="172"/>exhausting his scanty Finances in keeping Com∣pany with a Set of People, who are good humoured enough to be perpetually entertained with his Jokes.—</P>
<P>I will venture to affirm, that few Evils are more epi∣demic, than this Rage of being an HIGH-FELLOW, and I am apt to think, that many of those Bankrupt∣cies, which fill the Columns of the <HI>Gazette,</HI> are not en∣tirely owing to Losses in Trade, but to the pitiful Am∣bition of discovering a fine Vein of Humour. When once the sober Cit becomes the Ringleader in Wit and frolick Festivity, when once he has learned to <HI>elevate and surprize,</HI> his Shop assumes a gloomy Aspect; Book∣keeping is but a dull Employment, unfit for Men of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ner Senfations, and instantly his fervid Imagination conveys him to the <HI>Gentleman and Porter;</HI> then he cracks each Joke over again, and thrice he enjoys the Laugh, and thrice repeats the Pun. But in a little Time, his Name is inserted in the <HI>Gazette</HI> with a WHEREAS; his former Companions shake their Heads, and are very sorry for it; <Q>he was a Wag, a merry Man; a CO∣MICAL FELLOW,—but Business is a serious Thing.</Q></P>
<P>Poor <HI>Jack Spatter!</HI>—He is at present the most re∣markable of all THE AGREEABLE DEVILS I have ever known. <HI>Jack</HI> does not want a Share of native Hu∣mour, and he dresses up a Story at second hand with such additional Touches, that a Man is frequently as much entertained as if he had never heard it before, or if he himself had not told it to him the very Day be∣sore. For it is often the d'verting Rogues Way unwit∣tingly to fasten with <HI>something cursea High</HI> upon the very Person, who at first supplied him with the Subject. And then THE GENIUS is such a Mimick!—Well to be sure nothing can escape him. A Cat, a Dog, a Monkey, a Manager, a <HI>Burletta-Girl,</HI> a <HI>Woodward,</HI> a <HI>Garrick,</HI> all must undergo the Touches of his humouróus Imitation, and mean while, the Company, Whores, Waiters and all, do so laugh, and so shake their Side,
<PB N="170" REF="173"/>that Life is quite flat and insipid without <HI>Jack Spatter.</HI> But in this World, where, as <HI>Moliere</HI> says, <HI>on donne rien pour rien,</HI> where every Thing must be paid for, it can∣not but prove very expensive to be thus aspiring in Company. But <HI>Jack</HI>'s Vanity extends to Expence, as well as Wit and Humour. How many Shifts have I known him to make, that he might display his Vivacity at the Tavern!—A Turtle-Feast was sometime since fixed at the <HI>King</HI>'s-<HI>Arms</HI> in <HI>Cornhill,</HI> and <HI>Spatter</HI> was in∣vited to make one. "A Turtle Feast," says <HI>Jack,</HI> <Q>very well!—it can't be better—Citizens laugh hear∣tily when their Bellies are full—I'll certainly go— but how to pay my Reckoning!—There's <HI>Title∣page,</HI> the Bookseller;—he likes a Touch of my Humour—he'll tip me two Guineas for an Epi∣logue—I'll write him one—let me see what's here?—<HI>Dryden</HI>'s <HI>Miscellany!</HI>—I'll transcribe one from this.</Q>—No sooner said than done, for <HI>Jack</HI> has quick Parts, and away he sets out towards <HI>Fleetstreet,</HI> meets his Friend <HI>Humdrum</HI> at <HI>Temple-Bar,</HI> reads the Piece to him, to shew what a COMICAL DEVIL he is; <HI>Humdrum</HI> admires it; <HI>Jack</HI> forgets that he stole it, and admires it more, touches Two Guineas from <HI>Title-page,</HI> and who but he at the Turtle-Feast? A <HI>Masquerade</HI> re∣quires somewhat a larger Capital. "Egad," say <HI>Jack,</HI> <Q>I'll write a Pamphlet for that, and touch Five Gui∣neas</Q>—To work he falls, and finishes his Piece in the Space of one Morning, though it cost the Original Au∣thors from whom he compiled it, many nocturnal Vi∣gils. A Jant to <HI>Tunbridge,</HI> in the Summer Season, with some Lovers of Wit and Humour could not but be agreeable to Mr. <HI>Spatter;</HI> and so instantly he sets down and writes a Farce; and because <HI>Fielding</HI>'s <HI>Coffec∣house Politician</HI> is not very likely to be acted again on either of our Stages, what does the merry Wag do, but he takes the Character, gives it a new Name, makes a little Alteration in the Scene, where the
<PB N="171" REF="174"/><HI>Politician</HI> reads the News-Papers, and instantly <HI>Genial Jacob, and a warm third Day,</HI> as the Poet has it, equips the GENIUS for <HI>Tunbridge.</HI> Thus is the CURSED HIGH FELLOW, the AMIABLE FRIPON, perpetually spending the Income of his Brain, and torturing his Invention in Endeavours to live with those, who have Fortunes to supply their Expences, and who do not entertain the least Symptom of Friendship towards their merry Com∣panion. What will become of him, when he has played all his Tricks, I tremble to think, and, as if his Mis∣fortunes were now present, I cannot help crying out, <Q>Alas, poor <HI>Yorick!</HI>—I knew him, a Fellow of infinite Jest—where be your Gibes now? Your Flashes of Merriment, that were wont to set the Table on a roar?—Quite Chop-fallen!</Q></P>
<P>But my Fancy has pictured this Scene of Distress so strongly to me, that I could wish some Means could be devised to avert the impending Evil. An Ingenious Gentleman, whom I have the Pleasure of knowing, proposed some Time since a Scheme for an HOSPITAL FOR DECAYED POLTS. Suppose, in Imitation of this laudable Design, an Hospital were to be raised for DECAYED COMICAL FELLOWS. For my Part, I cannot but think the Plan should meet with general Encourage∣ment, and I will willingly give the Profits of this Paper, N<SUP>o</SUP>. 79, towards carrying it into Execution. Mr. <HI>Gar∣rick</HI> and Mr. <HI>Rich</HI> will, I dare say, contribute on their Parts an annual Benefit towards this Charity, the Ob∣jects of which may be admitted, as follows.</P>
<P><Q>It being certified to us, that the Bearer—<HI>A.B.;</HI> was an AGREEABLE DEVIL, and entirely ruined him∣self by endeavouring to keep Company with Men of Fortune, who countenanced him merely as their Jester, you are hereby directed to admit the said unhappy pleasant Creature into the Hospital for DECAYED COMICAL FELLOWS, <HI>London</HI>—<HI>Signed by Two Directors.</HI></Q>
<PB N="172" REF="175"/>
Should this Proposal take Effect, I shall rejoice at being instrumental in the Redemption of so many diverting Creatures from utter Misery; for surely it would be melancholy to reflect that he, who often enlivened even the sprightly <HI>Champain,</HI> might become miserably witty in an Ale-house, or be a joking <HI>Boot-catcher</HI> at an Inn, and tell your Honour a Story, while he is divesting your Legs of their leathern Incumbrance. I shall there∣fore hope that all true Lovers of Humour will promote the Scheme, just hinted, for the sake of those, who ruin themselves for their Pleasure; and I shall be highly pleased that there will be a Receptacle for poor <HI>Jack Spatter,</HI> and that the AGREEABLE DEVIL may, in his old Days, find Repose in the HOSPITAL FOR DECAYED COMICAL FELLOWS.</P>

<P>THIS Day came on a remarkable Trial in this Court, in which the <HI>Muffin-Man,</HI> the <HI>Watchmen,</HI> &amp;c &amp;c. &amp;c. were <HI>Plaintiffs,</HI> and—<HI>Shuter,</HI> Comedian at the Theatre-Royal in <HI>Covent-Garden, Defendant,</HI> up∣on an Action brought against the said <HI>Shuter</HI> for Da∣mages suffered by the <HI>Plantiffs</HI> at a public Exhibition on <HI>Wednesday</HI> Evening last, when they were all taken off, as it is called, with such lively Touches of Mimickery, that the Audience was kept in a constant Burst of Laughter, to the very great Uneasiness of the said <HI>Plain∣tiffs.</HI> The Jury being impanelled, Counseller <HI>Blunder∣buss</HI> opened the Cause in a very vehement Speech. He inveighed severely against <HI>Stage-Players,</HI> and urged, it was a very great Hardship, that honest and worthy Characters should be converted into Ridicule by the Buffoonery of an impertinent Player. For his Part, he would take upon him to say, that his Clients were Per∣sons of known Integrity, Probity, and Honour, and he
<PB N="173" REF="176"/>thought them more valuable Characters in Life than any Set of Comedians whatever.</P>
<P>The <HI>Muffin-Man,</HI> he insisted, was so reputable and worthy a Personage, that nothing but the Height of In∣solence could induce a Mimic on the Stage to attempt to hurt him in his Reputation. If these Things are per∣mitted, he could not determine where the Thing would end, and he himself, he added, might be treated in the same Sort; he therefore prayed, that the Gentlemen of the Jury would take the Premises into Consideration, and award suitable Damages. He then proceeded to call his Witnesses.</P>

<P>I live near <HI>Temple-Bar.</HI> I saw the Prisoner at <HI>Comus</HI>'s Court, and he was so diverting, that I took two Tickers for myself and my Wise. I could have swore as how it was our Watchman that was speaking, and I also heard the <HI>Muffin-Man</HI> very distinctly, and my Wife did the same; and I thought it very misbecoming that honest Folks should be brought to Shame in that public Manner.</P>

<STAGE>Elizabeth Sugarkey.</STAGE>
<P>I was sent with a good Character from the Register-Office, to live in a sober quiet Family, and with much ado—Lord bless me! I never had so much trouble in my Life about any Thing—Mrs. <HI>Molly</HI> was waiting for me till almost one o'Clock before we could set out—and so at last we went, and we got Places near the Door in the <HI>Piazza,</HI> and there we waited till the House was opened. And then there came such a Crowd of Fellows that it was with much ado we got in at all—and when we did get in, they placed us on the Stage—Well! sure I never was so ashamed in all my born Days—I thought I looked as impudent as any Actress among them,—and at last the Prisoner came on the Stage, and as he was passing by, he said to me, "you had better take off your Pat∣tin's Miss" Saucy-Fellow!—and so be began to mimic
<PB N="174" REF="177"/>the <HI>Muffin-Man,</HI> and it was the very same Person that serves my Mistress with <HI>Muffins.</HI></P>
</SP>
<STAGE>The Defence.</STAGE>
<P>Mr. <HI>Shuter</HI>'s Council owned the Fact, but offered many Arguments in Mitigation. They insisted, it could not be of any material Detriment to the Plaintiffs, even allowing that they were mimicked. Why, theresore, then, continued the Council, "I cannot perceive, Gen∣tlemen of the Jury <Q>that my Client—a—has—incurred so severe a Penalty; because why—it was not done with an evil Intent—and—a—my Client has but fol∣lowed the Example of Mr. <HI>Garrick,</HI> who formerly availed himself of his Talents for this Species of act∣ing, and took very pleasant Liberties with all the Actors on the Stage. As did likewise—a—Mr.— <HI>Foote,</HI> who called it, if I remember right, <HI>giving Chocolate.</HI> Why therefore then, all that is to be said in the present Case, is—a—that—my Client, Gentle∣men of the Jury, has given Chocolate to the <HI>Muffin-Man.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Upon this the Jury withdrew, and in a few Minutes brought in their Verdict Not-Guilty; whereupon the Court dismissed Mr. <HI>Shuter</HI> with Honour, and told him if he does but endeavour strenuously to exert his comic Powers, with a close Eye to Nature, he cannot fail to be an excellent Comedian. <HI>Adjourn'd.</HI></P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Application of Part of our Time to Letters is recommended by the Author of my Motto in such glowing Colourings, as serve at once elegantly to display the mani∣sold Advantages resulting from Study, and at the same Time prove an Incentive to every Mind to enlarge its Views, and encrease its Store of Ideas, by a due At∣tention to the Labours of the Learned. "Letters," says the <HI>Roman</HI> Orator, <Q>cherish and invigorate the Mind in its greener Years, amuse it in the more advanced Periods of Life, beam a Lustre on Prosperity, and soften the Shocks of Adversity; they yield Delight in our domestic Hours, and are no Incumbrance abroad; they protract the Midnight-hour, are our Fellow-Travellers in foreign Parts, and make the best Part of Equipage in all our rural Excursions.</Q></P>
<P>I am aware, that the Translation, which I have here offered, falls many Degrees short of the Purity and graceful Strength of the Original; but such as it is, it may, in some Sort, serve to inculcate the real Utility of a very pleasurable Occupation, which is at present too much neglected by People of Condition of both Sexes. Mr. <HI>Addison</HI> wonders how Men of Sense can spend so many Hours together, without receiving any other Ideas than what are suggested, by an Arrangement of black
<PB N="176" REF="179"/>and red Spots. But such is the prevailing Fashion of the Times, that the <HI>Book of Four Kings</HI> is the only <HI>Vo∣lume</HI> at present perused with any Degree of Attention, and, I will venture to affirm, the <HI>Four motley Monarchs,</HI> are better beloved by several Persons of Condition than any <HI>real King</HI> in <HI>Europe.</HI> A Friend of mine, who has a Knock in conforming all his Compositions to the pre∣vailing Taste of the Town, tells me very seriously, that he has often wondered how Men of Discernment can sit down to Performances, which a little Experience Light inform them will never be read; such as, the <HI>History of England,</HI> the <HI>Life of Harry the Seventh,</HI> the <HI>History of Charles the First,</HI> the <HI>History of Lewis the Four∣teenth,</HI> &amp;c For his Part, he is determined to avail him∣self of the favourite Passions of his Readers, and is now actually employed in <HI>compiling Memoirs</HI> of the KING OF EPADES, the Annals of the KING OF CLUBS, Anec∣dotes relating to the KING OF HEARTS, Remarks on the KING OF DIAMONDS, including Battles more me∣morable than those of <HI>Cressi</HI> and <HI>Poitiers,</HI> fought in the verdant Plains of <HI>Picquet, Cribbidge, Quadrille, Whist,</HI> &amp;c. in which will be interwoven the private Characters of the <HI>Knaves,</HI> with the secret History of the <HI>Queens,</HI> their Intrigues, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The Work to be published in Numbers, Price One Guinea each Weekly Number; in proper Places will be inserted a beautiful Copper-Plate of the <HI>Crowned-Heads and eminent Personages,</HI> taken from the original Drawings now in the Possession of the <HI>Club at White</HI>'s; at the particular Desire of several Persons of Quality, five Thousand Copies will be printed upon Royal Paper; the Subscribers Names to be annexed with their Places of Abode, and how many Card-Tables each Person keeps, which may serve to give Posterity some Idea of the Grandeur of the present Age.</P>
<P>I make no Doubt but this Work, if carried into Exe∣cution, will be in great Demand, and, I am sensible, that a Disinasive from Pursuits of this Nature will be the
<PB N="177" REF="180"/>Jest of every tittering Card-Table in Town. I must, however, beg Leave to inform my pretty Readers, that they are highly mistaken, if they imagine, that, by de∣dicating a few Hours to litterary Amusements, they en∣danger their lovely Features, and run a Risque of dim∣ming the sparkling Lustre of the Eye. On the con∣trary, a Page or two in a Morning may serve to adjust the Countenance, and the Acquisition of a new Idea may give a more engaging Ornament to the Head, than a new <HI>Paris</HI> Cap, and the Eye will certainly beam with more Attention, when directed by an active Principle within, than when it swims round the Room in pretty, giddy, vain, senseless Affectations? How sinely has Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> described the Consequences attending a Life spent thus in a Circle of Follic.!

<L><HI>Alive, ridiculous!—and dead, for got.—</HI></L></Q> How much more eligible therefore is it to employ some Portions of our Time in a Way, that will furnish the Mind with Ideas fit to be communicated to rational Crea∣tures, and give an Embellishment to the highest Sphere of Life. Add to this, that softening Quality, which Let∣ters have in all Cases of Adversity. In the Day of Affliction, the surest and most certain Relief the Mind can receive, will be derived from the Habit of being conversant with Books. If I remember right. it is Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> that observes, in his <HI>Conduct of the Understanding,</HI> that a Power of transferring our Thoughts from one Object to another, is an Essential requisite in a well∣formed Understanding. And surely nothing can better help to prevent the Mind from dwelling too long upon any habitual Set of Ideas, which may induce a settled
<PB N="178" REF="181"/>Form of Melancholy, than an Attention to the Perfor∣mances, which Men of learned Leisure have sent into the World.

</EPIGRAPH>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">N</SEG>OT to admire, is the golden Rule, esta∣blished by <HI>Horace,</HI> for the Acquirement of inward Peace and Happiness, and also for securing the Tenure of them, when once obtained. The same Precept may also be enforced as the surest Method to form a sound Understanding, and to preserve the Judgment free and undistempered. Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> in his <HI>Essay on Criticism,</HI> a Poem, in which good Sense and Poetry are beautifully combined, has given this Observation the Sanction of a Maxim;
<Q><HI>For Fools</HI> ADMIRE, but Men of Sense APPROVE.</Q>
<PB N="182" REF="185"/>In our greener Years indeed, when the young Affections are, to use the Poet's Phrase, <HI>tremblingly alive all o'er,</HI> when every Object presents itself in some new and strik∣ing Attitude, fond ADIMRATION may be then allowed to gaze, and each Incident in the Scene of Life may call forth the juvenile Expressions of Wonder and Asto∣nishment. But surely, when we become somewhat hackneyed in the Ways of Men, when Habit has coated over that Quickness of Sensation, which attends the raw and inexperienced Mind, the elevated Brow of Amazement may be expected to subside to the sober Cast of Reflection and Knowledge. I am at present ac∣quainted with a Gentleman, who has made so many sensible Animadversions on the various Occurrences of Life, that, I am convinced, nothing can arrive to excite in his Breast any Emotions of Surprize, and I have often heard him say very humorously, <Q>Lord! I have already known so many unexpected Turns and Revolutions of Things, that were I to see the MONUMENT walk down <HI>Cheapside,</HI> and take out St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s Church to dance a Minuet, it would make no Manner of Im∣pression on my Spirits, no more than when I read that it will be High-Water at <HI>London-Bridge,</HI> at half past Ten.</Q></P>
<P>But in the general Mass of Life, there is such a la∣mentable Inanity in the Minds of most People, and the Gross of Mankind are so scantily furnished with Ideas, that there are but few, who, when taken from their ma∣nual Occupations, or their other Business, do not fall into a sluggish Oscitancy, for want of a Sufficiency of Matter to employ their intellectual Faculties. Thus by an habitual Remissness in reviewing the ordinary No∣tices of Things, the Power of arranging and comparing our Ideas in their manifold Relations to each other, which we commonly call JUDGMENT, lies indolently dormant, and the Consequence is, that, upon every Emergence, the idle Passions of Astonishment take
<PB N="183" REF="186"/>Possession of the Soul. It is observable, that, this Dis∣ease is not always confined to the unenlightened Part of Mankind, but we may sometimes perceive this mental Debility among those, who, from their Education, and from their Intercourse with the World, might be ex∣pected to be somewhat more solid. There are, perhaps, in the Circle of my own Acquaintance, at least half a score Persons, possessed of Talents capable of extensive Discernment, and of thinking very justly upon any or∣dinary Topics of Conversation, and yet, through an Habit of Inattention, such a total Relaxation unstrings their intellectual Powers, that they in Fact appear to have impotently pinned their Faith on other Mens Sleeves, and to have lost all Kind of Capacity of judg∣ing for themselves. It is among such People, and such only, that THE COMICAL FELLOW, or THE AGREEABLE DEVIL, whom I have described in a former Paper, ac∣quires his prodigious Reputation for Wit and Humour. Sir <HI>Andrew Wonderful</HI> has for some Time past been esteemed a knowing one by his Neighbours in the Ward of <HI>Farringdon without,</HI> and in his Business, he is accounted a Man of very notable Dexterity; but spend the Evening with Sir <HI>Andrew</HI> at any Tavern on the St. <HI>James</HI>'s Side of <HI>Temple-Bar,</HI> and he is all Amazement from the Time he enters the Room, until his old, rumbling Coach conveys him back to the City. If you mention to him the Lie of the Day, that the Lady of a certain noble Lord was caught in Bed with a Lieutenant of the Guards, <Q>Good Law! says Sir <HI>Andrew,</HI> you dont say so!</Q>—It's very true though, and this Morn∣ing early a well-dressed Man walking across <HI>Lincoln</HI>'s-<HI>Inn Fields</HI> fell down dead—<Q>Dear Heart, says the Knight, you surprize me!</Q>—Late last Night a Game at <HI>Whist</HI> was played at <HI>White</HI>'s Chocolate-house, on which upwards of three thousand Pounds depended—<Q>Three thousand Pounds! I never heard of such a Thing in
<PB N="184" REF="187"/>my born Days—three thousand Pounds!—Good Law!—Three thousand Pounds!</Q>—</P>
<P>Every Man, who is actuated with the laudable Am∣bition of being a rational Creature, should endeavour to fix within himself such Habits of thinking, as will keep him collected, and prevent his Thoughts from being scattered into wild Surprize upon every little Emergence that offers. There should certainly be cherished in every Breast an honest Pride in preserving its own free Agency, and maintaining an Independency of Understanding, self-impelled, and self-directed; awakened into think∣ing by the Impressions of its own Ideas, and adopting all its Principles and Maxims from the Suggestions of its own Judgment. For surely there can not be any Thing more unmanly, than leaving either the Faculties of the Soul, or the Muscles of the Face to be played upon by the Will and Pleasure of another. To have a Titter ready whenever the COMICAL FELLOW chuses to be facetious, and to hold a Man's Belief at another's Disposal, according as he chuses to decide upon any Subject, most incontestibly indicates a weak and frivo∣lous Understanding.</P>
<P>I was led into this Tract of Thought by a Reflec∣tion on the Manner, in which I spent an Evening, this Week, with three Gentlemen, who had sollicited the Meeting with earnest Importunity. During the last six Weeks, I never met any one of them, but he instantly began, <Q>Well! my dear Boy, when shall we have an Evening—you know it is what we have long wished for?</Q>—At length the <HI>Rendezvous</HI> was fixed, and at the appointed Hour I met my Friends, not without very high Expectations of a pleasant Evening. A Bottle of <HI>Allen</HI>'s in an Instant appeared on the Table, and circu∣lated with uncommon Celerity. I then expected my Friends to open some Vein of Discourse, but all con∣tinuing in determined Silence, in order to break the Ice, I began with an ordinary Topic, and enquired about
<PB N="185" REF="188"/><HI>Elizabeth Canning.</HI> <Q>I suppose, said I, the Govern∣ment is resolved to let her see foreign Parts.</Q>— That's <HI>Humour,</HI> said one of the Gentleman to his next Neighbour, and then they all burst into a loud Laugh. I did not perceive the Joke, but, continued I. <Q>whe∣ther she is guilty or not, it will do her no Prejudice to see the World.</Q>—"<HI>Humour</HI> again," says the Gen∣tleman who sat opposite to me; <Q>You're a fine young Fellow,</Q> says a second; "This is high," says the third, and then all three formed a Chorus of Laughter. "The Captain, who carries her abroad," added I, <Q>will have a good Contract of it; for he need give her nothing but Crusts and Water for six and twenty Days, and she'll subsist upon that.</Q> <HI>Another Touch,</HI> says my Friend over the Way. <HI>Admirable!</HI> cries his Neighbour, and the Gentleman next to me, alarming me with a Slap on the Shoulder, roars out—"Odzouns," and then <HI>Laughter, holding both his Sides,</HI> took possession of them for the Space of ten Minutes.</P>
<P>Upon this, I perceived, that my Company held more of ADMIRATION, than of JUDGMENT, and I became heartily tired of the Party; though, were I inclined to Self-Approbation, they omitted nothing that could ad∣minister to my Vanity; the Gentleman opposite to me frequently testifying his Approbation with that's <HI>Hu∣mour!</HI> the second, repeating, <HI>you're a fine young Fellow!</HI> and my next Neighbour thundering in my Ear his rap∣turous <HI>Odzouns!</HI> which extraordinary Interjections were absolutely the Sum total of all the Conversation, that I heard from these three notable Blanks in the Creation. I accordingly took occasion to break up the Meeting as soon as possible, and upon retiring home to my Chambers could not help drawing up this loose Essay, which I have ordered my Publisher to send to each of the Gentlemen, in order, if possible, to cure them of their servile Ad∣miration, and inform them, if they desire to be ranked
<PB N="186" REF="189"/>among Free-Agents, that their only Title to it consists in thinking and judging for themselves.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>Dear</HI> CHARLES,</SALUTE>
<DATELINE><HI>Richmond,</HI> <DATE><HI>May</HI> 10, 1754.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>WERE I not to inform you, you would certainly never be able to guess at what Hour I have now set down to write to you, It is now almost Six in the Morning, and I have already spent half an Hour in an agreeable Attention to some certain domestic Cares, which have taken possession of me since my Retreat to the Country. I am here a Kind of <HI>Pater-familias</HI> with all my little Brood of Hens and Chickens around me. I look upon myself to be greatly interested in their Wel∣fare; their Wants, and their Inconveniencies it is my earnest Care to remove. I am entirely conversant with their different Tempers, and can tell you the ruling Pas∣sions of each of them. I can here shew a <HI>Bantham</HI> Co∣quette, and a Prude from the other Side of the Line; among the Males I have a Coxcomb, a Bully, a Coward, and, in short, almost all the Characters that offer in hu∣man Life.</P>
<P>Since my rising from my Pillow, I have interposed in two violent Feuds, and in this Manner am I enter∣taining myself, while my Friend <HI>Ranger</HI> is, perhaps, reeling home from some Tavern; or, it may be, like your admired <HI>Horace,</HI> tumbling and tossing in restless Impatience for the Arrival of some delusive Fair, whose Persidy has carried her to a Rival's Arm's.
<Q><L><HI>— Mendacem stultissimus usque Puellam</HI></L>
<L><HI>Ad mediam expectans noctem.—</HI></L></Q> If this is not the Case, you lie in enervating Repose, and slumber away the Prime of Life, in a few Hours more to wake from a distempered Dream, with a troubled Spirit, a throbbing Pulse, and with Nerves en∣feebled and relaxed. Give me leave here to address you in the Words of the excellent Author of the Seasons.
<PB N="189" REF="192"/>
<Q><L><HI>Falsly luxurious, will you not awake,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And rising from the Bed of Sloth, enjoy,</HI></L>
<L><HI>The cool, the fragrant, and the silent Hour,</HI></L>
<L><HI>To Meditation due and sacred Song.</HI></L></Q> Believe me, Dear <HI>Charles,</HI> the most jovial Three in the Morning at the <HI>Shakeypear,</HI> never can afford such home∣felt Delight, as plays around the Heart-strings in this calm Period of the Morning. The Mind is then cheer∣ful and serene; Fancy is light and airy, and seems to threaten I know not what prodigious Things; every Object excites finer Feelings and more delicate Percep∣tions, than can be suggested to the <HI>heat-oppressed Brain,</HI> as <HI>Shakespear</HI> phrases it.</P>
<P>Prithee, honest <HI>Ranger,</HI> how long is it since you saw the Sun rise? I dare believe not since we were together at <HI>Eaton.</HI> But surely, if this Phaenomenon had not very expansive Beauties, the Poets would never have been so fond of seizing every Opportunity to describe it. Since I have mentioned this Circumstance among the Poets, I must observe, that our great Dramatic Bard has in two Passages excelled all the Writers from the Days of <HI>Homer,</HI> down to the present State of modern Poetry, in their favourite Openings of the Morn. The Saffron∣tinctured Fingers of <HI>Aurora,</HI> the Sun rising from <HI>Thetis</HI>'s Lap, the Daughter of the Dawn coming from the Bed of <HI>Tithonus,</HI> are, in my Opinion, all poor and ineffectual, when compared with the more natural Description in <HI>Romeo</HI> and <HI>Juliet;</HI>
<Q><L><HI>—Jocund Day</HI></L>
<L><HI>Stands tiptoe on the misty Mountain's Top.</HI></L></Q> I have compared this admirable Piece of Imagery, for several successive Mornings, with the real Object in Na∣ture, and I really am at a Loss which to admire most; like the travelling <HI>Persian,</HI> who, when the Reflection of the solar Rays (as happens sometimes in those Countries)
<PB N="190" REF="193"/>have formed in a Cloud another imaginary Sun, gazes at both with reverential Eyes, in doubt with himself to which he shall offer his Morning Adoration. The se∣cond Passage I mean, is, in the Tragedy of <HI>Hamlet,</HI> where after seeing the Ghost of the deceased King, <HI>Horatio</HI> breaks off with,
<Q><L><HI>But see the Morn in Russet-mantle clad.</HI></L>
<L><HI>Walks o'er the Dews of yon high eastern Hill.</HI></L></Q> You know the Poets are fond of personalizing both physical and moral Qualities, in order to give Anima∣tion to their Poetry, and to throw Things as much as possible into Action; and here, surely, we have that creative Figure in its high Perfection; the whole Pic∣ture could not receive finer Colourings from the Hand of <HI>Titian;</HI> the Drapery is beautiful, and the Action in which this poetical Being is represented, is admirably descriptive of the first Dawnings of the Day.—</P>
<P>My, Dear <HI>Ranger,</HI> come, and let us criticise upon this Phenomenon; let us enjoy that Delight, which the Mind takes in comparing the Objects of Imitation, with the Finishings of mimic Art. Let me assure you, that to see this gradual Expansion of the solar Influence on the Face of Nature, will give such a calm Flow of Spi∣rits for the ensuing Vocations of the Day, as cannot be experienced in a City Life. You will possibly say, you had rather loiter in your Chambers, than endure the in∣tolerable Rage of the Sun tending to his meridian Height. In this Case, <HI>Richmond-Park</HI> affords its nmbrageous Walks, where the Noontide Ray has no Access. How sweet here to lose oneself in pleasing Error, to re∣cline under an impervious Shade! and there in lettered Indolence converse with <HI>Maro, Tully, Pope, Shakespear, Milton, Spencer;</HI> or with <HI>Waller</HI> cry out,
<Q><L><HI>O! how I long my careless Limbs to lay</HI></L>
<L><HI>Under a plantane Shade, and all the Day</HI></L>
<L><HI>With am'rous Airs my Fancy entertain!</HI> &amp;c.</L></Q>
<PB N="191" REF="194"/>Or, if inclined to diversify the Scene, and ramble about in gentle Exercise, what Place so fit as these very Gar∣dens, which afford all the Variety in Nature? Do you delight in trim Hedges, uniform Vistas, smooth Pastures, and studied Regularity? Your Taste may here find enough to gratify it. Or are you rather like the Person of a truer Sense of Things described by <HI>Martial, Rure vero barbaroque laetatur,</HI> one who likes true Country, rude, barbarous, and unspoiled by the Elegancies of Art? Here you are suddenly surprized to find yourself upon a barren Heath, lost to the World, and nothing pre∣sents itself to View, but the withered Shrub, and the blasted Clump of Trees, and Hares and Rabbits run∣ning athwart the dreary Scene. From hence, it may be, you wander into some Forest, and hear the Wood∣man at his Labour; then issue out upon the ploughed Land, and behold around you nothing but busy Tokens of rural Industry; then, led by the Hand of Contempla∣tion, lose yourself in the Solitude of the Hermitage, or wander into
<Q><L><HI>The Thrush-haunted Coppice, where lightly leaps</HI></L>
<L><HI>The fearful Fawn the rustling Leaves along.</HI></L></Q> If, at length, you are satisfied with this Retreat, <HI>Rich∣mond-Hill</HI> invites your Steps, from whence you may command a boundless Prospect of all the Country round. There Villas, stately Buildings, Groves, Meadows, the Woodland, fertile Pastures, Hills and Vales offer them∣selves to the Sight in mixed Variety. The barren Heath, and the Sun-burnt craggy Soil appear with all those Sof∣tenings to the Eye, which Distance throws upon a Land∣scape; and Nature all around appears with all her stri∣king Majesty and all her softer Graces.</P>
<P>To crown the Whole, at the Bottom of the Hill <HI>Thames</HI> expands his rural Stream. To pursue it in its se∣veral Windings, fertilizing the Country round, is at once a Refreshment to the Eye, and the constant Suc∣cession
<PB N="192" REF="195"/>of new Objects, takes off from that Stillness, which would otherwise overspread the Whole. Here, my Dear <HI>Charles,</HI> we enjoy that Tranquillity of which <HI>Virgil</HI> speaks so feelingly; here we have Innocence, living Lakes embowering Shades, indolent Repose be∣neath an Arbour, and the Mowing of the Cows; Mu∣sick, believe me, far preferable to the <HI>Savoyard.</HI> or a City Concert. Besides this, let me assure you, you will find the Muses more coming Girls here, than in the Noise, and Smoke of <HI>London.</HI> But, I fear I have length∣ened this Letter beyond all Bounds; I can only tell you after an eminent <HI>French</HI> Writer, had I Time enough, I would make it shorter; but take it as it is, loose, ram∣bling, and desultory, and believe me to be,</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>FTER having perused the new Tragedy of <HI>Creusa,</HI> with all that Pleasure which re∣sults from a well-conducted Story, and in∣teresting Situations of the <HI>Dramatis Perso∣nae,</HI> I was at length struck in a very particular Manner with the second Epilogue, which the Author has an∣nexed to it. A Parliament of Women suggests many Ideas of a pleasant Nature to the Fancy, and there is a Variety in the Turn of Expression, for which this little
<PB N="194" REF="197"/>Piece may very justly be called a pretty Composition. Having laid aside the Book, I found that the female House of Commons had taken entire Possession of my Imagination; I fancied to myself, to see my amiable Countrywomen engaged in a deep Debate; the lovely <HI>Whigs</HI> and <HI>Tories</HI> carried on their Party-Divisions with great Warmth and vehement Elocution; the Words <HI>Court</HI> and <HI>Country</HI> Interest, <HI>British Constitution, Patriotism, Virtue, Bribery</HI> and <HI>Corruption, Liberty</HI> and <HI>Property, free uninfluenced Election, arbitrary Power,</HI> with a long <HI>Et caetera</HI> of Phrases, were methought banded about by these beautiful Representatives, with as much Zeal and Impetuosity, as ever they could possibly have been from the Days of <HI>Hampdex</HI> down to the present happy Period. Their Fans. I imagined, prettily diversified with va∣rious emblematical Figures; and, instead of love-sick Virgins, Jessamine Bowers, Rural Swains playing on the Flute, they displayed to View nothing but Scaffold∣ings, Executions, Scenes of Broils and Battles, Sea∣pieces, embattled Squadrons, the Spirit-stirring Drum, as <HI>Shakespear</HI> has it, the <HI>Ear-piercing Fife,</HI> the <HI>Royal-Banner,</HI> and <HI>every Circumstance of glorious War.</HI> The Patch no longer served as a mere Embellishment of Beauty, but carried with it a very expressive Energy, and denoted the Attachments of the Ladies to the Court or Country-Party. <HI>Blue</HI> and <HI>Yellow</HI> Ribbons adorned the Head-Dress, and hung out a Kind of Flag of De∣fiance to the opposite Party. Elections were strongly contested all over the Kingdom: The <HI>Old</HI> and <HI>Now Interest</HI> clashed in <HI>Oxfordshire,</HI> and ended at last in a double Return. In <HI>Kent</HI> a Lady of antient and ho∣nourable Family was thrown out. The People of <HI>Bri∣stol</HI> paid a voluntary Compliment to a Lady of distin∣guished Genius, who had been instrumental in bring∣inging <HI>Bristol</HI> Stone-Buckles into Fashion. After a very
<PB N="195" REF="198"/>warm Contest for the City of <HI>London,</HI> upon finally clo∣sing the Poll the Numbers stood thus;
<LIST>
<ITEM>Lady <HI>Betty Alworthy,</HI> She-Knight, and <HI>Milliner</HI> 3650</ITEM>

<P>Whereupon the four first were declared duly elected, and the last mention'd Lady, it was said, would be brought in for some other Place at the Recommendation of an old Dutchess at Court. The Writs being all re∣turned. I supposed the Parliament assembled, the Ladies in the Upper-House, and the Commoners in the Lower. The Female Commons immediately proceeded to chuse a Speaker, which was a Point of great Difficulty, every one being eager for that Office, upon a Supposition, that the Speaker was to have the largest Share of the Debate; but being undeceived in this Point, the Matter was at length adjusted, and they then went upon Busi∣ness. As several Occurrences offered themselves to my Thoughts on this Occasion, I shall throw the Busi∣ness of this Part of my waking Dream, into the Form made Use of on these Occasions.</P>

<P>THE Board of Criticism came to a Resolution last Night, not to adjourn until Mr. <HI>Garrick</HI> closes the Theatrical Season. The Commanding Offi∣cer of the <HI>Covent Garden</HI> Forces, has dismissed the <HI>Subal∣terns</HI> to their Country Quarters. They have carried with them a Store of Thunder and Lightning, very proper for the Summer-Season, a Flying <HI>Mercury</HI> troubled with a Rupture, the Straw being ready to fall out of his Abdomen; a Bowl of Poison <HI>(wants new gilding)</HI> several cast off Dominos for <HI>Romeo</HI> and <HI>Juliet,</HI> a well toned Bell, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> so that it is not doubted, but the Country People will have as much <HI>start, strut</HI> and <HI>roar,</HI> for their Money, as ever was exhibited at the Theatre-Royal.</P>
<P>Since our last arrived a Mail from <HI>Vaux-hall,</HI> which brings Advice, among other Particulars, that Miss <HI>Burchell</HI>'s Voice charms every Hearer with its Melody, and there are great Crowds every Evening to refresh themselves with the <HI>Tin Cascade.</HI> It is further suggested, that there is a great Struggle among the minor Poets, which shall be elected <HI>Vaux-hall</HI> Poet for the ensuing Season. Mr. <HI>Lyrick</HI> and Mr. <HI>Spondee,</HI> have each of them given in Specimens of their Talents, in those little De∣signs, that are amorous, and yet innocent, as Mr. <HI>Bayes</HI> says; but, the Waiters are of Opinion, that it will be decided in Favour of <HI>Quinbus Flestrin,</HI> the unborn Poet, whom we have already mentioned, he being a Person of undoubted Appetite, and passionately fond of the Amusements of this Place, both in eating and drinking.</P>

<Q>Contemptor Divûm <HI>Mezentius</HI> —
<BIBL><HI>VIRG.</HI></BIBL></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>T the last Meeting of our Club, of which I must consider myself an unworthy Mem∣ber, as I have not of late attended them with proper Punctuality, my Friend Cap∣tain <HI>Gulliver,</HI> whom I formerly introduced to the Ac∣quaintance of my Readers, produced a Paper, which he said, he had brought with him from <HI>Cairo,</HI> amongst several other Manuscripts of the same Nature. After perusing it, I judged it would make no improper En∣tertainment for my Readers, and I therefore have or∣dered it a Place in this Day's Paper.</P>
<P>In the Days when the Empire of <HI>Bagdad</HI> spread Ter∣ror round the Nations, and their conquering Arms added a constant Accession of Honour and Wealth to the Califfs, <HI>Aboulcasem,</HI> a Youth of extensive Parts and boundless Ambition, had the Address to raise himself to the first Honours of the State, and in Process of Time, he arrived to the Dignity of Vizier. In this Office his Conduct was such as might be expected from a Person of his exalted Parts. His Renown for Genius and a bright Understanding distinguished him above the Rest of the Ministers, and the Name of <HI>Aboulcasem</HI> was wafted on the Wings of Fame through all the Regions of the Last.</P>
<P>But amidst all the Effulgence of his Glory, <HI>Aboulcasem</HI> was hurried away by the Violence of his Passions, which were rapid as the Cataracts of the <HI>Nile,</HI> and vio∣lent as the Whirlwinds in the Desart. His Soul was apt to kindle into a Blaze at the Sight of Beauty, and in the Height of his national Business he would
<PB N="201" REF="204"/>frequently sport away his Hours in wanton Dalliance with a <HI>Circassian</HI> Beauty, with whom he would often betake himself to the Baths, and there, in amorous Dis∣sipation, write Letters upon Matters of the utmost Con∣sequence to the <HI>Califf,</HI> and the whole Empire of <HI>Bagdad,</HI> and dispatch them to his Agents, whom he had sent to other neighbouring Courts. At length, he was suspected to favour the Cause of the banished Prince <HI>Abdallah,</HI> who was then wandering about the Desarts of <HI>Arabia;</HI> and though no convincing Proofs could be alledged against him, yet not being able to vindicate himself from the Imputation, he was obliged to fly his Country.</P>
<P><HI>Aboulcasem</HI> immediately betook himself to the Prince <HI>Abdallah,</HI> and finding his Cause totally ruined, without any Possibility of re-instating him, he then exerted all his Industry to obtain Leave to return home. As Things of this Nature cannot be compassed in a short Time, in order to hinder his Mind in the mean Time from falling a Prey to Melancholy, and all the Horrors of disap∣pointed Ambition, he applied himself to the Labours of the wise Men in order to relieve his Mind. Here he penned his Thoughts upon Exile, and many other im∣portant Points of speculative Morality. He lived like an Hermit in the Desarts of <HI>Arabia,</HI> and there, illustri∣ously hid, he carried on his Researches into the Study of Nature, History, and all the Branches of human Learning which could adorn and enrich so accomplish∣ed a Mind.</P>
<P>Thus furnished with all mental Embellishments, <HI>Aboulcasem</HI> was in Time permitted to return, but he was not restored to his Honours. As Ambition is ever un∣relenting, he was no sooner fixed in his own Abode, than he instantly became an implacable Enemy to the Vizier, who had consented to recal him. He drew from the Stores of Knowledge, which he had formerly treasured up, some of the severest Reflections, which could be made upon the Minister's Administrations, and
<PB N="202" REF="205"/>this in such a powerful Strain of nervous Eloquence, that he may very justly be said to have had a great Share in his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ownfal. <HI>Aboulcasem</HI> was so happy as to have accomplished this Business, which was for a long Time the grand Object of his Intentions; but it was no sooner done, than he perceived himself as distant as ever from re-gaining his Prince's Ear. He therefore betook himself to his Country-House at a small Di∣stance from <HI>Bagdad,</HI> where he employed himself in reading all the Moralists of <HI>Arabia,</HI> and in short, all the fine Eastern Writers. In this Recess he cultivated an Acquaintance with two of the first Geniuses of his Time, <HI>Selim</HI> and <HI>Mirza;</HI> the former was remarkable among the Eastern Sages for elevated Strains of Poetry, and the latter for those Oriental Tales, which are generally called the <HI>Tale of a Tub,</HI> and the Adventures of <HI>Gulli∣ver,</HI> the Merchant of <HI>Bagdad.</HI> These two undertook the Defence of <HI>Aboulcasem</HI>'s Character, and spared no Pains to blazon his Fame to the World.</P>
<P>Mean Time <HI>Aboulcasem</HI> pursued his Researches into all the Branches of human Wisdom; the civil Polity of States was to him a Store-house, which disclosed a con∣stant Fund of Supply; he then turned his Eye inwards upon the Texture and Make of his own Mind; he used to say, that the Mind was a concealed Repository of Riches, and that it behoved every Man to find out the Secrets of it; this accordingly he did; but he did not enjoy the secret, selfish Gratification of many, who, when in Possession of a Treasure will never let it be seen by human Eyes; on the contrary, he was glad to have every Opportunity of displaying himself, and this ra∣ther to a Degree of Ostentation; from this Branch of Study <HI>Aboulcasem</HI> proceeded to examine into Matters of Religion; the various Systems of the Eastern Sages were all to him perfectly well known; he laughed at the <HI>Keran;</HI> the System of Morality which <HI>Confucius</HI> taught, <HI>Aboulcasem</HI> held in Contempt; <HI>Mahomet</HI>'s Paradise was
<PB N="203" REF="206"/>to him a mere <HI>Chimaera,</HI> and he declaimed with a pompous Flow of sounding Eloquence against all these various Opinions; the <HI>Bramins</HI> were always the Ob∣jects of his severest Contempt; in the Dictates of natural Religion, he would say, we have no Occasion for such Guides, and in the Explanation of established Forms, they are highly dangerous; he was an Enemy to all Forms of Worship offered in the Temple of the Pro∣phet; he endeavoured to subvert the Principles upon which this Worship was founded, and to introduce a new Form of Thinking of his own. Since <HI>Aboulcasem</HI> could have no Share in the Direction of State-Affairs, he was determined to soar above sublunary Things, and to have the Lead in Matters of higher Importance. He was highly dogmatical in his Assertions, and he carried his Extravagance so far, as to advance, that there was no Difference between the human Species and Brutes; and that it was highly probable that Dogs and the rest of the animal Creation were endued with Souls as well as Mankind; and in the general he asserted that all Souls were material.</P>
<P>In the midst of these Disquisitions, <HI>Aboulcasem</HI> was sitting one Night in his Study, his Lamp burning be∣fore him, when of a sudden, Thunders rolled deep and awful over his Head; the Mountains were shaken and they groaned; keen Lightenings flashed athwart the Hemisphere; the third Heaven was opened, and a Flood of Radiance descended upon the Earth. The So∣lemnity of the Scene appalled the Heart of <HI>Aboulcasem;</HI> Trembling seized his Limbs; he fell prostrate and adored the Messenger from God, who now stood before him, and spoke in Accents, which chilled the Blood within him, and made him stand convinced of his vain Philosophy.</P>
<P><Q><HI>Aboulcasem,</HI> said he, receive my Sayings with an Ear of Attention. Know then, that the Eye of him, who is in the third Heaven hath beheld thee; he hath
<PB N="204" REF="207"/>viewed thy Ways with Compassion, and he hath made this Vision a Vehicle of Instruction unto thy Soul, which is at present lost and bewildered in a Maze of idle and foolish Philosophy; for thy Philo∣sophy is not calculated to advance true Knowledge, Virtue, and Wisdom, but has its Source in Osten∣tation. Ostentation and Vain-glory have induced thee to display thy imagined Superiority of Parts, which pretends to pervade all Systems of Religion, and thy Heart's Conceit will approve of none. Thy Studies are ill directed, and their Drist is only to alienate the Minds of Men from any settled Form of Worship, which you are in the Wrong to disturb, as your own Insufficiency cannot substitute a better than what is designed to keep Society in a due Sense of Resigna∣tion to a Supreme Being, and to preserve the Bands of civil Compact religiously unbroken. Cast but thine Eye upon yonder Vale; behold what is there transacted. There thou may'st see Men divested of all Forms of Worship, and rendered perfectly con∣formable to thy vain Notions of Religion. There thou may'st see what is the State of Man ungoverned by settled Forms of Devotion; they have shaken off all Regard to the Prophet, and behold them immersed in all Manner of vicious Practices. Uncontrouled they invade each other's Rights; they make War to gratify their Ambition; freely without Restraint they proscribe whom they please; the Bonds of Society are broken, and the Contempt of divine Laws has introduced a Contempt for all human Institutions. To promote this Scene of Confusion are thy Writings calculated, but know, and dread the Truth I am now to utter, that it will better behove thee to pay Submission to the established Forms of Worship of thy Country, than to disturb the Peace of the Faithful, and thereby fill their Minds with Doubt, with Jealousy,
<PB N="205" REF="208"/>Mistrust, Suspicion, and all the Horrors of an over∣weening Imagination.</Q></P>
<P>At these Words the Radiance, which spoke, with∣drew from his Eyes, and left <HI>Aboulcasem</HI> in the utmost Consternation; the Impression was, however, very soon effaced; for notwithstanding this Admonition, he per∣severed in his ill Designs; but the Thread of his Days was cut short before he could vent them abroad into the World. However, his Intentions were not totally fru∣strated, for the Hand of Death had no sooner smote him, than his Compositions fell into the Hands of <HI>Namahran,</HI> another Eastern Writer, who sold them for a certain Number of Sequins of Gold, and by those Means the Writings of <HI>Aboulcasem</HI> came into every Body's Hands, and spread their baneful Influence on the Minds of all the Inhabitants of <HI>Bagdad.</HI></P>

<Q>Vere magis, quia Vere calor redit ossibus—
<BIBL><HI>VIRG.</HI></BIBL></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE gloomy Month of <HI>November</HI> is distin∣guished by Foreigners, as the Heighth of the Season for <HI>Englishmen</HI> to hang and drown themselves; but from a diligent Observation I can venture to affirm, that the Month of <HI>May</HI> is always attended with a larger Bill of Mortality than any other Part of the Year. It is the Spring-Time of Love, when the Blood has received a Renovation of Warmth, and young Minds are then more easily melted down in the amorous Fire. A Bookseller, whom I now and then chat with at his <HI>Circulating Library,</HI> informs me, that he can tell when the Poison of Love begins to rankle in the Breast, that he can trace it in its Pro∣gress, and knows exactly when it is become quite ge∣neral in its Influence. Romances, he says, in the Be∣ginning are more and more call'd for; as it encreases, Lord <HI>Grey</HI>'s Love Letters, the Loves of <HI>Octavia</HI> and <HI>Philander, Abelard</HI> and <HI>Eloise,</HI> Letters from a <HI>Nun to a Cavalier,</HI> &amp;c. come into Play; and when the Infec∣tion is grown Epidemic, then the Tragedies of <HI>Romeo and Juliet, All for Love, or the World well lost,
<PB N="207" REF="210"/>Theodosius or the Force of Love,</HI> &amp;c, cannot be supplied quick enough to answer the wonderful Demand for them. My ingenious Friend will sometimes take me into his back Room, and "Friend <HI>Ranger,</HI>" says he, <Q>can't you touch us up some secret Memoirs, or a Love-Tale, or something by Way of Novel—If green Peas come in fast—the Season for Peas is always favourable to love-sick Minds—I can manage to put you off— let me see—ay, about a couple of thousand by Mid∣summer—yes, thereabouts—I could get—if you will put your Name to it,—a matter of fifteen hundred subscribed among the Trade—how will you make it end?—happy or unhappy?—for there will be a Difference in that—but, that must be determined by the Chapter of Accidents—a North-East Wind chills the amorous Heat—in that Case, you had bet∣ter make them die—but, if the southern Gale con∣tinues, they may in the Conclusion be <HI>conducted by the laughing Loves to the nuptial Bower</HI>—the Book will soon be in every Body's Hands, at <HI>Tunbridge, Bath, Scarborough, &amp;c.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Thus is this skilful Person in his Trade for taking Advantage of that Succession of Foibles, which are constantly rising and falling in the most whimsical Vi∣cissitude in this Metropolis. The Truth of it is the Play-houses, the Circulating Libraries, the public Gar∣dens about Town owe very much of their Success to the love-sick Minds of Boys and Girls. It is this uni∣versal Passion which rolls so many of the Youth of both Sexes down the soft Declivity in <HI>Greenwich-Park;</HI> it is this which is so fond of taking cold at the Tin Cascade in <HI>Vaux-hall</HI> Gardens, and it is this which pours forth so many Groupes of Enamoratos along the Fields and Meadows about <HI>London</HI> every <HI>Sunday</HI> Evening.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the extensive Influence of this soft Infection, it is somewhat surprizing that among all the Writers, who have endeavoured to describe it, very few
<PB N="208" REF="211"/>of them have succeeded in any tolerable Degree. What Numbers of <HI>English</HI> Tragedies have been sunk into an insipid Languor by the ineffectual Whim of Episodic Love? The Tragedy of <HI>Romeo</HI> and <HI>Juliet,</HI> excepting now and then some glittering Conceits, which we may suppose to be Transfusions from the <HI>Italian Novellist,</HI> who furnished <HI>Shakespear</HI> with the Story, affords a beau∣tiful Representation of two young Minds touched with this tender Sympathy. Many of the Tragedies of <HI>Beau∣mont</HI> and <HI>Fletcher,</HI> though they are now too much neg∣lected, display the delicate Sensations of Love, in all their native genuine Simplicity. I am not clear whe∣ther the fine Interchange of Sentiments between <HI>Jaffier</HI> and <HI>Belvidera</HI> should come within the Precincts of Love; because the Desire of Possession, which fires the tender Imagination into a gentle Enthusiasm, has then sub∣sided into a sympathetic Friendship between Man and Wife; and accordingly the most pathetic Touches are derived, not from the Lover's fond Hope of mutual Bliss to come, but from a Retrospect to those vanished Hours, when <HI>Jaffier</HI> lay for three whole happy Years in his <HI>Belvidera</HI>'s Arms; and thus the Transition from their former Endearments to their present Misery, ex∣cites those intense Emotions of Pity for their Fate. Perhaps, after the Writers just mentioned, the Tragedy of <HI>Tancred</HI> and <HI>Sigismunda,</HI> has the fairest Claim to any Degree of Reputation; in this Piece the Love of the young Prince is manly, and never dwindles into childish Conceit; the Feelings of <HI>Sigismunda</HI> are delicate and sensible, and through all the Scenes the Softness of their Passion is ennobled by Sentiments of Honour and moral Dignity. But, among all the Books, which the ena∣moured of both Sexes are apt to call for at this Season of the Year, there is none which can exhibit so lively a Picture of Love, as the Fourth Book of <HI>Dryden</HI>'s <HI>Virgil,</HI> which I would recommend to my young Readers, not by Way of adding Fuel to the Fire, but to warn them
<PB N="209" REF="212"/>of the Dangers of the growing Flame; as they will here perceive all the Vicissitudes of the Passion, till at length it terminates in a melancholy Catastrophe.</P>
<P>I shall conclude this Paper with an Extract from an unpublished Pamphlet, written by an ingenious Gentle∣man, who has given me Leave to make my own use of it. It is called the History of <HI>Rosamond</HI>'s <HI>Pond for the Month of May,</HI> and, though some of the Incidents are not the Effects of Love, it will, however, shew many of the Disasters that attend that sweet, but dangerous Sensation.</P>

<HEAD>The History of Rosamond's Pond for the Month of May.</HEAD>
<P>A young Lady of Fashion, whose Name it is thought proper to suppress, flung herself into the Pond, because she had an Amour with <HI>Thomas</HI> the Footman; she was taken up by the Centinel, and only damaged a Gauze Capuchin.</P>
<P>Miss <HI>Betty Threadneedle,</HI> Milliner, in the <HI>New-Ex∣change,</HI> threw herself in, on account of Ill-usage from Monsieur <HI>Capriole,</HI> a <HI>French</HI> Figure-Dancer at <HI>Drury-Lane</HI> Play-house; the Coroner's Inquest sat upon her Body, and brought in their <HI>Verdict, Lunacy.</HI></P>
<P><HI>William Ponderwell,</HI> was in Love with a celebrated Coquette, and after paying an Attendance of several Months, he was at length quite tired out, and walked very demurely to the Brink of the Pond, where he stood for some Time fixed in Thought, then changed his Mind and walked home very cooly.</P>
<P><HI>Bob Dare Devil,</HI> having very passively received a Kicking from an Officer, threw himself in the oblivious Lake, that he might not survive the Loss of his Honour; he was taken up, and now lights your Honour across the Way about <HI>Drury-Lane</HI> Play-house.</P>
<P><HI>John Henpeck,</HI> drowned himself, after walking very soberly with a Friend in the <HI>Bird-Cage</HI> Walk. There were found in his Pocket, a Cork-Skrew, a Tobacco-Stopper,
<PB N="210" REF="213"/><HI>Passeran</HI> upon Self-murder, and a Piece of Pa∣per, on which were written the following Lines,
<Q><L><HI>A frowning World, and a scolding Wife,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Is the Cause of my putting an end to my Life.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P><HI>Dick Nimblewrist,</HI> alias <HI>Crook-fingered Jack,</HI> sell in Love with a Gentleman's Handkerchief, but being dis∣covered in the Attempt to steal it, he was ducked by the Mob, in order to cool his unruly Passion.</P>
<P><HI>Dick Wildfire</HI> threw himself in about Six in the Evening, which drew together a large Concourse of People; but it being only a Frolick for a Wager, he swam across and got out again.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> He took cold, and died in a few Days of a raging Fever.</P>
<P><HI>Sappbo,</HI> the famous Poetess, fell in, while she was refounding aloft an Ode of her own composing, upon the new Building at the <HI>Horse-Guards.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fresh-coloured Moll,</HI> was tired of the World, and went to fling herself into the Pond, but meeting a young <HI>Templer</HI> at the fatal Brink, she adjourned with him to the little Island, and instead of sending a Person out of the World, it is considently said, that in nine Months, she ushered a Foundling into it.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> She now fells Apples and picks Pockets in the Piazza of <HI>Covent Garden.</HI></P>
<P>Monsieur <HI>Languedoc,</HI> a <HI>French</HI> Gentleman, who came over here for his Religion, was challenged to box by a Pick-pocket in the <HI>Mall,</HI> whereupon he drew his Sword, which so enraged the Populace, that they took him to the Pond and ducked him three Times.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Fretful,</HI> Wife of <HI>John Fretful,</HI> threw herself in, because her Sister was better married, and kept more Card Tables than herself—Upon being taken out she said, <Q>There was no such Thing as bearing it, and that she was the most unhappiest Woman in the World.</Q></P>

It seems, <HI>Apollo</HI> was induced by frequent Murmurs and Complaints to dis∣solve his Parliament; some Malcontents among the Moderns, being of Opinion, that the Antients had ar∣bitrarily voted themselves perpetual Dictators in Wit; whereas, upon a free uninfluenced, Election, they be∣lieved themselves capable of returning a larger Number than the said Antients. The Party for the Moderns was led on by Monsieur <HI>De la Motte, Perrault</HI> and <HI>Wot∣ton;</HI> the two former were vigorously opposed by <HI>Boi∣leau,</HI> Madam <HI>Dacier,</HI> and the latter by Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> and Doctor <HI>Swift. Swift</HI> ordered a new Edition of his Battle of the Books to be published forthwith, and <HI>Pope</HI> took occasion to reprint his Essays, and Criticisms upon <HI>Homer.</HI> The <HI>Old</HI> and <HI>New Interest</HI> were the Words by which each Party signified their Attachments, and Reams of <HI>Lampoons, Acrostics,</HI> and <HI>Rebusses</HI> were issued out by the Moderns, which were all answered by Epi∣grams, Fables, and Burlesque Pieces written by the Friends of the Antients.</P>
<P>At length the Writs were issued out to the proper Officers to chuse Representatives for the several Coun∣ties and Borough-Towns in <HI>Parnassus,</HI> some Places, by poetic Licence, having Leave to return as many Mem∣bers, as could fairly prove a Qualification. <HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Virgil</HI> were declared for epic Poetry; <HI>Milton</HI> was set up by the Encouragement of several Friends, and they were all three accordingly chosen. <HI>Homer</HI> had four and twenty upon the Poll, and <HI>Virgil</HI> twelve; <HI>Milton,</HI> by an Assessment a little before the Election, created two new Votes, by which he also reached the Number twelve, and <HI>Virgil</HI> was so modest that he made no Ob∣jection to it. <HI>Tasso,</HI> and Sir <HI>Richard Blackmore,</HI> were declared Candidates, but the former was proved to have bribed with <HI>clinquant,</HI> and the latter could not make out a Qualification.</P>
<P><PB N="214" REF="217"/>In the Regions of Tragedy, <HI>Sophocles</HI> and <HI>Euripides</HI> joined Interests, and <HI>Aristotle</HI> undertook to canvass for them; but <HI>Shakespear</HI> carried it by a great Majo∣rity; <HI>Corneille</HI> and <HI>Racine</HI> stood next upon the List, but a Scrutiny was demanded in Favour of the <HI>Old In∣terest,</HI> upon a Suspicion that several <HI>Copy-holders</HI> had polled for the Moderns, and the <HI>New-Interest</HI> employed some <HI>French</HI> Critics to go through their Answer; it was thought it will at last end in a double Return; and it was further said, that <HI>Otway</HI> and <HI>Row</HI> would be de∣clared duly elected. <HI>Dryden</HI> and <HI>Lee</HI> joined Interests, and though many gay and flighty Persons were very warm in their Cause, their Schemes were looked upon by the cool and judicious, as rather too wild and ro∣mantic. The <HI>French</HI> Critics threatened, that at some future Election, they should be able to make more Members, being resolved to put up <HI>Crebillon</HI> and <HI>Vol∣taire</HI> even against <HI>Shakespear,</HI> to which end, several Li∣bels against the last mentioned Genius were already drawn up by <HI>Voltaire.</HI></P>
<P>In the comic Territories the Antients lost their Elec∣tion by a very great Majority; <HI>Moliere, Ben Johnson, Congreve</HI> and <HI>Vanburgh,</HI> being declared duly elected. <HI>Shakespear</HI> was made an honourary Member for this Quarter, and was universally allowed to be a Represen∣tative of both Places. <HI>Dryden</HI> found Means, by the As∣sistance of a <HI>Spanish</HI> Friar, to insinuate himself into this Place, and it was given out, that when <HI>Colley Cibber</HI> ar∣rives here, he will be put up as a Person duly qualified, though it is apprehended that his Quarrel with <HI>Pope</HI> has deprived him of several Votes.</P>
<P>The <HI>New Interest</HI> exulted greatly upon their Conquest in the last Election, and in order to compleat their Triumph, proceed further into the Regions of <HI>Humour</HI> and <HI>Ridicule. Homer</HI> was here again put up by <HI>Aristotle,</HI> who urged the <HI>Margites</HI> as a sufficient Claim; but the Writings of that Estate being lost, he was obliged to
<PB N="215" REF="218"/>decline the Poll. After this, an Advertisement was pub∣lished, desiring the Votes and Interest of all the true Sons of Merriment for <HI>Aristophanes, Menander, Plautus,</HI> and <HI>Terence,</HI> who had just lost their Election in another Place; <HI>Lucian</HI> set up upon his own Interest. The <HI>Moderns</HI> declared <HI>Cervantes, Rablais, Swift</HI> and <HI>Butler</HI> joint Candidates, being all Gentlemen heartily attached to true Wit and Humour. Votes were also sollicited for several other Personages; Monsieur <HI>la Sage, Scarroon, Marivaux,</HI> and <HI>Addison</HI> were strongly recommended; but the latter being returned in Conjunction with <HI>Te∣rence</HI> and <HI>la Sage</HI> for the Borough of POLITE-MIRTH, Sir <HI>Richard Steel</HI> appeared on the Hustings, and with∣drew his Friend's Name. <HI>Swift</HI> mixed with the lower Sort of People; joked with the Women about their Dressing-rooms, and republished his Account of the strange Man just arrived in Town. <HI>Rablais</HI> contributed a good deal to the general Mirth; <HI>Cervantes</HI> occasion∣ally gave vent to a Vein of low Humour, but <HI>Lucian</HI> could not make himself universally understood, and many of his Turns did not allude to modern-practised Life. <HI>Scarroon</HI> got together a Company of Strollers, and exhibited Entertainments in Booths with great Suc∣cess. <HI>Ward, Concanon,</HI> and <HI>Tom Brown</HI> offered them∣selves on this Occasion, but were rejected with Con∣tempt. At length the Books were closed, and <HI>Lucian Cervantes, Butler,</HI> and <HI>Swift</HI> were declared duly elected. At which the Managers for the <HI>New Interest</HI> were highly instamed; they lodged a Petition in Favour of <HI>Rablais,</HI> but such a Vein of Extravagance run through the Whole, and some Passages were worked up into such a Strain of unintelligible Frolic, that it was generally supposed it would be given against him. However, his Friends were determined to bring him in for an inferior Bo∣rough, and <HI>Scarron</HI> and <HI>Marivaux</HI> were also assured of their Election. Whenever <HI>Fielding</HI> shall arrive to his
<PB N="216" REF="219"/>Estate in this Part of <HI>Parnassus,</HI> there is a Borough ready to elect him.</P>
<P>To have so many Moderns chosen for the last Divi∣sion was highly agreeable to the <HI>New Interest;</HI> they were however a good Deal dejected at the Election for <HI>History,</HI> for which the Contest was ineffectual. <HI>Thyci∣dides, Sallust, Livy,</HI> and <HI>Tacitus</HI> being chosen by a great Majority. <HI>Faminianus Strada</HI> endeavoured to hurt the Election of the last mentioned Writer, in order, as it was thought, to substitute himself; but <HI>Peers</HI> being al∣lowed to appear at Elections in <HI>Parnassus,</HI> Lord <HI>Boling∣broke</HI> gave all his Interest to <HI>Tacitus,</HI> and assured him that his Works were of infinite Use in all his political Tracts. <HI>Sallust</HI> recommended St. <HI>Real,</HI> an approved <HI>French</HI> Historian, to a Borough. <HI>Julius Caesar</HI> was put up without his Consent, a literary Fame not being the Object of his Ambition; Lord <HI>Clarendon</HI> was for a long Time decried by a Party, but was at last declared duly elected.</P>
<P><HI>Demosthenes</HI> and <HI>Cicero</HI> harangued from the Hustings, and were unanimously chosen for <HI>Oratory;</HI> and it was thought that some who have made a conspicuous Figure in the <HI>British</HI> Parliaments, would be admitted to the Ho∣nour of a Seat with those immortal Geniusses. A Party of <HI>Frenchmen</HI> endeavoured to make a Stand, upon the Strength of some certain Funeral Orations, but in a few Hours they found themselves greatly out-polled.</P>
<P><HI>Horace, Boileau, Dryden,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> were made the Representatives of <HI>Satyr; Juvenal</HI> and <HI>Perseus</HI> ha∣ving set up for Places upon their own separate Interests; as soon as the Election was over Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> thanked the Constituents for the Honour conferred upon him, and signified his Inclination to take his Seat for <HI>Ethics,</HI> to which he was reeommended by the Lord Viscount <HI>Bo∣lingbroke,</HI> and the Voters came to a Resolution to fill up the Vacancy by putting up the famous Doctor <HI>Young,</HI> though in his Absence.</P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="220"/>Lord <HI>Bacon</HI> and Mr. <HI>Locke,</HI> were returned for real and useful Philosophy, at which <HI>Aristotle</HI> was violently curaged. He was, however, somewhat comforted to find himself the first on the Poll for <HI>Criticism; Longinus, Quintilian,</HI> and <HI>Bobours</HI> were also declared duly elected. There was a great Number of Boroughs in this County, most of which were repsesented by <HI>Frenchmen,</HI> the Chief of whom was the <HI>Abbé du Bos,</HI> Author of the Reflec∣tions upon Poesy and Painting. Mr. <HI>Addison</HI> was also returned in this District, but being previously chosen, he thanked the Voters in general, and told them they would not be at a Loss for a proper Representative for that Place, whenever the Author of the <HI>Polymetis</HI> should be willing to stand the Poll.</P>
<P>In the Regions of miscellaneous Poetry <HI>Dryden</HI> had an Offer from almost every Place; <HI>Spencer</HI> was elected for a Borough, said to be over-run with Witches and Fairies; in <HI>Pastoral, Ambrose Phillips</HI> exerted his utmost Interest; but it was said that Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> though he did not chuse to be the Representative himself, had resolved to hinder <HI>Philips</HI> from coming in. <HI>Virgil</HI> thanked the Country People for the Offers made to himself, expatiated on raral Happiness, and said he should always be a Lover of <HI>Woods</HI> and <HI>Rivers;</HI> but begged Leave to recommend in his room <HI>Vaniere,</HI> Writer of the <HI>Praedium Rusticum,</HI> and the late Mr. <HI>James Thompson</HI> Author of the Sea∣sons.</P>
<P><HI>Aesop. Phaedrus, la Fontaine</HI> and <HI>Gay,</HI> were chosen for the fabulous Country, where a new Party was springing up for the Author of the Fables for the <HI>female Sex,</HI> and, also for the Fables lately addressed to the Prince of <HI>Wales.</HI> With these Proceedings the <HI>New In∣trest</HI> had no Reason to be dissatisfied, though they were highly disappointed in several Places. However, they were determined to keep up their Spirits with a Shew of a general Victory. I fansied their Acclama∣tions
<PB N="218" REF="221"/>of Joy were so loud on the Occasion, that I was awaked from my Dream.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">M</SEG>Y Friend, Mr. <HI>Candid,</HI> desires that he may discharge his Promise to give some fur∣ther Animadversions on the Tragedy of King <HI>Lear;</HI> as he has run into a long Essay, I shall resign to him the entire Paper of this Day.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding what is ingeniously urged by the Gentleman, who obliged me with a Letter upon my former Criticism of King <HI>Lear,</HI> I cannot, after a Review of that Tragedy, find any Reason to retract my Asser∣tion, that the aged Monarch's Madness is occasioned by the Ingratitude of his Daughters. The Folly of a Pa∣rents putting himself in the Power of his Children, must incidentally appear in a Play, founded on such a Story as that of <HI>Lear;</HI> but, had those Children not proved ungrateful, I apprehend there is no Reason to imagine, the King's Mind would have taken the fatal Turn it did. But the best Way of knowing, with any Degree of Cer∣tainty, the secret Causes of those Effects, which disclose themselves in sundry Appearances in human Life, is
<PB N="220" REF="223"/>by gaining an Insight into the private Tempers of Men. <HI>Lean</HI> considered in this Manner, soon discovers to us the latent Seeds, which are likely to kindle into a Blaze, upon the Revolt of his Daughters. The Impression which <HI>Cordelia</HI>'s artless Answer had upon him is de∣scribed by himself.
<Q><L><HI>—O most small Fault,</HI></L>
<L><HI>How ugly didst thou in</HI> Cordelia <HI>shew,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Which, like an Engine, wrench'd my Frame of Nature</HI></L>
<L><HI>From these a Place; drew from my Heart all Love,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And added to the Gail—</HI></L></Q> This plainly evinces where the old Man's Passions were most accessible, and how strong the Workings of them were likely to be, when he should find a total Disaffec∣tion: No wonder if then his Frame of Nature is wrench'd from the fix'd Place, and indeed, his Ten∣dency that Way soon discovers itself, when he breaks out into these Words.</P>
<Q><HI>I will forget my Nature;—so</HI> KIND <HI>a Father!</HI>—</Q>
<P>Were the Loss of Royalty uppermest in his Thoughts, his Remarks would most assuredly take their Tincture from thence, and he would rather blame himself as a WEAK <HI>Father,</HI> who had given all to his Children. But the Circumstance of his having given all, is never men∣tioned, unless it is to aggravate the Ill-usage he has met with, and when he says to himself, <HI>To take't again per∣force,</HI> it is plain, that it is not merely for the sake of re∣gaining lost Grandeur, but to avenge his Wrongs; and he immediately subjoins, <HI>Monster Ingratitude!</HI>—and a little after, <HI>let me not be mad; not mad, sweet Heaven!</HI> —The hool, indeed, taunts him with the Folly of his having divested himself of his Power, and put the Rod, as he calls it, in his Childrens Hand. These Ideas are so obvious, that <HI>Shakespear</HI> knew they would strike even the most superficial Mind; but we find it is no Consi∣deration
<PB N="221" REF="224"/>with the Father, who never dwells upon it, though it is suggested to him so frequently. On the other Hand, how acute are his Feelings, whenever he recurs to his Daughters want of filial Piety! He that can read the following Lines, without being softened into Tears, must, as Mr. <HI>Addison</HI> has said upon another Occasion, have either a very good, or a very bad Head.</P>
<Q><L>—<HI>Oh!</HI> Regan, <HI>she has tied</HI></L>
<L><HI>Sharp-tooth'd</HI> UNKINDNESS <HI>like a</HI> VULTURE <HI>here</HI>—</L>
<L><HI>—I scarce can speak to thee—thoul't not believe</HI></L>
<L><HI>With how depraved a Quality—Oh!</HI> Regan!—</L></Q>
<P>What a Picture of a Mind have we here?—The Strugglings with his Sorrows, the Breaks of Passion, the Attempt to speak, and the instant Suppression of his Powers, are the most natural and pathetic Touches. Can the human Imagination, in all her Treasury of Lan∣guage, find Words to express at once the detestable Crime of Disobedience to our Parents, and the exqui∣site Feelings of an injured Father, like the following Passage?</P>
<Q><L><HI>—She has struck me with her Tongue</HI></L>
<L><HI>Most Serpent like upon the very Heart!</HI></L></Q>
<P>Who is there, that does not instantaneously find himself in a Gush of Tears on reading these Lines? And more particularly, when, a little afterwards, he comes to the Speech which closes with,
<Q><L><HI>—You think I'll weep;—</HI></L>
<L><HI>No, I'll not weep—tho' I have full Cause of weeping—</HI></L>
<L><HI>—This Heart shall break into a thousand Flaws</HI></L>
<L><HI>Or e'er I'll weep—O Fool, I shall go mad—</HI></L></Q> The last Touch in this Speech, is the finest close of a Climax of Passion that can be conceived; and even then the old Monarch feels that his <HI>Wits begin to turn,</HI> for which melancholy Situation, <HI>Shakespear</HI> all along
<PB N="222" REF="225"/>finely prepares us, by skilfully marking each Step the Mind takes, in all its Workings, towards that settled State of Grief.</P>
<P>I have dwell'd thus long on the Cause of <HI>Lear</HI>'s Distraction, because the Arguments, offered by my in∣genious Correspondent in the Essay of the 19th of <HI>Ja∣nuary,</HI> carry some Degree of Plausibility; but from what has been premised, together with what I have urged in my former Paper, there cannot, I think, re∣main any Doubt about it. Those that are not satisfied with this reasoning are referred to the noblest Com∣mentary this, or any Poet ever had; I mean Mr. <HI>Gar∣rick</HI>'s Performance of <HI>Lear,</HI> in which there is displayed so just a Knowledge of the human Mind under a State of Madness, together with such exquisite Feelings of the various Shiftings of the Passions, so finely at the same Time enseebled with the Debility of Age, that I be∣lieve, whenever this admirable Actor ceases to play this Part, the unhappy Monarch will lose more than <HI>fifty of his Followers at a Clap.</HI>—</P>
<P>Though our great Poet pays us very amply for all his Transgressions against the Laws of <HI>Aristotle;</HI> yet, I have frequently wished, that the noble Wildness of his Genius had not rendered him so unbounded in his Fa∣bles. Had this Tragedy been planned with more Art, without an underplot to draw off our Affections from the principal Object, it had been a Piece for all the united Efforts of <HI>Greece</HI> to envy. However, the Episode, in which the <HI>Bastard</HI> is acting the same unnatural Part as <HI>Lear</HI>'s legitimate Daughters, is not entirely detached from the main Subject; the Misfortunes of the good old <HI>Gloster,</HI> who endeavours to assist the forlorn King, must touch every Breast, and the Character of <HI>Edgar</HI> must appear amiable in every Eye.</P>
<P>The close of this Tragedy is full of Terror and Com∣miseration, and our great Foet has here given us a Death, which is not often to be found in the Play∣house
<PB N="223" REF="226"/>Bill of Mortality, <HI>viz.</HI> the Death of <HI>Lear</HI> with∣out the Dagger, or the Bowl. But, perhaps, af∣ter all the Heart-piercing Sensations, which we have before endured through the whole Piece, it would be too much to see this actually performed on the Stage; from the Actor whom I have already named, I am sure it would; though, I should be glad to see the Experiment made, convinced at the same Time that the Play, as it is altered, will always be most agreeable to an Audience, as the Circumstances of <HI>Lear</HI>'s Restoration, and the virtuous <HI>Edgar</HI>'s Alliance with the amiable <HI>Cordelia,</HI> must always call forth those gushing Tears, which are swelled and enobled by a virtuous Joy. The Alteration is justified by another Rea∣son, which is, that <HI>Lear</HI> was really restored to his Crown, if we may believe <HI>Spencer,</HI> who gives the following re∣markable Narrative, with which I shall close this Paper, making no Doubt, but it will afford great Entertainment to the Reader who has not before amused himself with the Comparison, to see <HI>Shakespear</HI>'s Story related by so great a Poet as <HI>Spencer,</HI> in his tenth Canto of the <HI>Fairy-Queen.</HI></P>

<P>I have ever looked upon the warlike Hero, in the former Instance, to be in a very ridiculous Situation, and surely the Author, who can quit the Pursuit of nobler Game, to follow an idle Scribler in the Form of a Pamphlet, a Letter to a Friend, an unmuse-like Poem, or a pointless Epigram, must, in the Eyes of the Judi∣cious, appear to act unworthily, and very much beneath himself. On this Account it is, that <HI>Ranger</HI> has hitherto kept himself clear of all Disputes with his Brethren of the Quill, and has incessantly pursued his Plan, though there have not been wanting Things, <Q>that would be Poets thought,</Q> who have endeavoured to molest him in his Career.</P>
<P>But deaf to all such Avocations, I have attended only to the Prosecution of the Design this Paper first set out with, <HI>viz</HI> to conduce my utmost to the Entertain∣ment and Instruction of my Readers. The former of these Views, I flatter myself, has in some Degree suc∣ceeded, and with Regard to the latter, I do not pre∣tend to have enlightened the Understandings of all my Cotemporaries, nor to have brought about a general Reformation of Men and Manners. The Truth of it is, I cannot consider the <HI>Gray</HI>'s-<HI>Inn Journal,</HI> as a general
<PB N="227" REF="230"/><HI>Panacea</HI> for the Defects of Mankind, though my Book∣seller and many of my other Friends <HI>(i. e.</HI> Enemies) have been pleased to compliment me on that Score. When I declare thus much, I beg, I may not be sup∣posed to envy the Fame of a very elegant and ingenious Brother-Writer, who very pleasantly congratulates him∣self on the extensive Amendment of Mankind since the Commencement of his Paper, and assures us, that there is no such Thing at present as Cards at <HI>White</HI>'s, or naked Shoulders at <HI>Ranelagh;</HI> and from the general Cessation of Vice, conceives the <HI>Millennium</HI> to be at Hand; at which happy Period he is determined to lay down his Pen.</P>
<P>For my Part, I shall not wait for the <HI>Milennium;</HI> for I must own, I have met with very different Success in my District, and therefore I am resolved not to cry out, in Imi∣tation of <HI>Falstaff</HI> to the vanquished <HI>Hotspur,</HI> <Q>there lies Vice; an the King will reward me;—so;—if not,—let him write the next Paper himself.</Q> So far from having any Title to this Boast, I have at present only one Letter by me, testifying the surprizing Cure wrought by my Lu∣cubrations, which is as follows.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>FOR twenty Years last past, I have been afflicted with a most extraordinary Species of Pride, which affected my Head to so great a Degree, that I could never, during that Time, bow it to any one, who was not possessed of a Fortune of ten thousand Pounds; which reduced me to such a Situation, that all my Ac∣quaintance shunned my Company. But upon Perusal of your Paper of the 24th of <HI>November,</HI> I immediately found such a Relaxation in the Sinews of my Neck, that I can already make a slight Bow to my Equals, and there is such an Amendment in my Organs of Speech,
<PB N="228" REF="231"/>that I can pronounce, <HI>Sir,</HI> or, <HI>Madam,</HI> to any decent Person of either Sex. The Truth of the above I am willing to attest on Oath, when called upon, and am,</P>

<P>This is the only Certificate I can produce at present of the Success of these Papers; and, though I suppose that Individuals have occasionally profited by them; yet my Intelligence says, that most of the fashionable Vices and Follies of this Metropolis are carried on with as much Alacrity as if, to use the Phrase of <HI>Moll Bluff,</HI> Charles Ranger <HI>had never been in the Land of the Living.</HI></P>
<P>By Advices from the City I learn, that, while the Husband is cheating for a Groat behind the Coun∣ter, the Wife is venturing Hundreds at a Rout; that the Course of Exchange was on <HI>Thursday</HI> last very much <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by the <HI>Jew</HI>-Brokers; that the Stocks <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> raised or lowered in <HI>Change-Alley;</HI> and that Criticism <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> prevails at <HI>Sam</HI>'s.

<P>But though this general Contagion of Vice and Folly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> prevails, I hope it will at least be found some De∣gree of Merit to have opposed it, and I persuade my∣self, that throughout these little Volumes, my Satyr has been to levelled, as not to have deserved the Displea∣sure of any worthy Character.

The several Stages which are fixed for its Progress are in a gradual Ascent from DULL, MUZZY, HEAVY, HOWISH, FINE, very FINE, HIGH, GREAT, IMMENSE BY G—D. The Mercury has not ascended this whole Week past further than GREAT, and it is thought, that

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Languages of all Nations have ever been in a State of Fluctuation, and we find this Complaint is constantly made by the sensible and judicious in every Age. Tho' the Diction of the <HI>Romans</HI> is likely to endure as long as Time shall subsist; yet we find that <HI>Horace,</HI> in the Words of my Motto, is aware of the Decay of Words and Phrases, which die away, and are constantly suc∣ceeded by a sudden Birth of new Terms and Modes of Phraseology. In several other Passages of his Writings, there are short Reflections upon this literary Phaeno∣menon, in which he always delivers himself with Sor∣row and Regret. They fall, says he, like Leaves, and are replaced by a new Product; like young Persons, they flourish for a short Time, and then tend to Obli∣vion. The Comparison is most certainly very just; and as young Men in their Bloom and Vigour are said to be <HI>upon Town,</HI> it is the same with Words; they are also
<PB N="232" REF="235"/><HI>upon Town</HI> for a Time, and then totally perish. I have often thought, that a <HI>weekly Bill</HI> of Words would not be unentertaining to Men of Letters, and if there was a proper Register Office for the Purpose, where their se∣veral Births and Burials might be recorded with Ac∣curacy and Precision, I should imagine it would furnish no disagreeable History. A Distinction might be made between a Kind of Sex in Words, according as they are appropriated to Men or Women; as for Instance, <HI>D—n my Blood</HI> is of male Extraction, and <HI>Pshaw, Fiddlestick,</HI> I take to be female. Upon this Plan the weekly Bill might stand in this Form.</P>

<P>If, for the Satisfaction on of the curious, a List should be furnished of the several Terms that are born, or that die away, with a short Account of the Life and Character of each Phrase, whether it be born of honest Parents in <HI>England</HI> or <HI>Ireland,</HI> what Company it kept, whether it was Whig or Tory, Popish or Protestant, it would in my Opinion be an agreeable Addition to this verbal History. There might further be added an Account of such Ex∣pressions as might happen to be naturalized, with the Objections of the Learned, who should think proper to protest against such a Naturalization of Foreigners among the Natives of this Land. Such a Procedure could not fail to yield Satisfaction to the curious; and, though it would not prevent the Instability of our Lan∣guage, it would at least display the gradual Steps to∣wards Improvement or final Destruction. For my Part, I have ever looked upon the Permanency of our Language to be of greater Consequence than the Stocks, of whatever Denomination, and for that Reason, I should be glad that some Mcans were devised to hinder
<PB N="233" REF="236"/>the Diction of our <HI>Shakespear</HI> and <HI>Milton</HI> from being ob∣literated, and to suspend the Evils, which Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> threatens us with, when he says
<Q><HI>And such as</HI> Chaucer <HI>is, shall</HI> Dryden <HI>be.</HI></Q></P>
<P>The Dictionary, which the Erudition of Mr. <HI>Johnson</HI> is preparing for the Public, may in some Measure an∣swer this End, and, in Aid to that Design I have been for some Time past planning a Dictionary of such Words, as appeared to me from a Concurrence of various Causes, to be most likely to be totally forgot. In or∣der to forward this Undertaking, I have annexed a Spe∣cimen of the Work, not as yet reduced into alphabe∣tical Order, but drawn out in such a Manner as may serve to convey some Idea of the intended Work. When the Whole is compleated it may serve as a proper Companion to the <HI>Spectator,</HI> the <HI>Tatler,</HI> and all the Works of Morality, which have been published in this Coun∣try, and it may be contributing to make our Posterity have some faint Notion of what is meant in many Places, when the visible Tendency of our Manners to an entire Change from antient Simplicity has almost effaced the Ideas, which the Author of the Times in∣tended to express.</P>
<Q><HI>A</HI> Specimen <HI>of an</HI> English Dictionary.</Q>
<P>CREATURE, A Term to shew our Contempt of any Person whom we dislike, chiefly used by the Ladies.</P>
<P>THING, Very often used to imply our Dislike, but chiefly used to signify our highest Approbation. Thus it is said of a fine Lady; "She's the very Thing," or of a young Fellow, "O, Ma'em, he's the very Thing;" and sometimes with Limitation, as, <Q>yes, very well, but not the Thing.</Q></P>
<P>PATRIOT, A Man who speaks against the Court till he gets a Place or Pension.</P>
<P>HONEST, This Term is derived from the <HI>Latin</HI> Word <HI>Honestum,</HI> which among the <HI>Romans</HI> implied every
<PB N="234" REF="237"/>Thing that is honourable in a Character. From thence <HI>Pope</HI> was induced to say,
<Q><HI>An honest Man's the noblest Work of God.</HI></Q> This is the original Meaning of the Word; in its con∣sequential Sense it is strangely altered. <HI>Honest</HI> now sig∣nifies Gaming, Drinking, and Debauchery of every Sort; it being common to say of a Man who is ad∣dicted to all these fashionable Vices, that he's an <Q><HI>Ho∣nest Fellow.</HI></Q></P>
<P>GOOD-NATURE, an old <HI>English</HI> Word used by our Ancestors; it is plain, that it carried with it some Allu∣sion to the Customs and Manners of those Times, but there is no tracing it to its Source.</P>
<P>RELIGION, an old <HI>English</HI> Word for the Worship of a Supreme Being, and the Practice of social Duties to our Neighbours; probably a Custom known to the an∣tient Druids.</P>
<P>HUMBUG, A Lye.</P>
<P>WORTH, originally it meant laudable Qualities of the Mind; at present tis solely confined to a Man's For∣tune: Thus a Scoundrel of fifty Thousand is a Man of <HI>Worth,</HI> and an honest Man in Indigence is <HI>worth</HI> no∣thing.</P>
<P>PARTY, sormerly signified Divisions in the State, at present it means a Jaunt to <HI>Vaux-hall, Bedlam, Church,</HI> or any Place of Diversion.</P>
<P>TRAGEDY, a Name by which <HI>Shakespear, Otway,</HI> and some others entitled their dramatic Writings; the Mo∣derns retain the Word, but have totally lost the original Sense of it.</P>
<P>COMEDY, probably a Piece in which our rude An∣cestors represented the Follies and Characters of the Age; nothing of this Sort is at present known amongst us.</P>
<P>DAMNED, when Priestcraft prevailed in this Country, the People were frightened with strange Ideas of <HI>Hell,</HI>
<PB N="235" REF="238"/>or a Place of Torture, where the departed Spirits of bad Men were supposed to be confined. At present it signifies the highest Praise we can confer. Thus we say, <Q>A damned fine Woman; a damned charming Crea∣ture; a damned fine Fellow, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q></P>
<P>DRUM, an Instrument of warlike Music used at the March of an Army, or in Time of Battle to animate the Soldiery: Hence stiled by <HI>Shakespear</HI> the <HI>Spirit stirring Drum.</HI> It has not been used to any Purpose by the <HI>English</HI> since the Days of the Duke of <HI>Marlborough.</HI> In its metaphorical Sense it means a Party of Cards, <HI>(Vide Rout.)</HI></P>
<P>FRIENDSHIP, an old <HI>English</HI> Word used by our An∣cestors to signify the complex Idea of Affection and Esteem between two or more Persons, founded upon a virtuous Sympathy of Tempers, and congenial Habits of Virtue (<HI>for the Meaning of the Word</HI> VIRTUE, <HI>see in its respective Place:)</HI> This Custom was totally banished in the Reign of King <HI>Charles</HI> II. and few or no Traces of it have been discovered ever since.</P>
<P>GOD, The antient <HI>Druids,</HI> it is probable from all Hi∣storians imagined that a superior Being super-intended the Direction of the Universe, and the Term GOD, it is not unlikely, originally fignified this superior Being; but since it has been happily found out, that every Thing was made by <HI>Chance,</HI> or that <HI>Nature, (Vide</HI> Na∣ture <HI>in its proper Place)</HI> produced every Thing we be∣hold, and since the Properties of Matter have been sufficiently detected by Lord <HI>Bolingbroke</HI> and others, the Term <HI>God</HI> is totally exploded, as merely expressive of some Chimaera, which has no Existence.</P>
<P>MODESTY, alludes to some Custom among the an∣tient <HI>British</HI> Ladies.</P>
<P>EARTHQUAKE, a Party at Cards. (Vide <HI>Rout, Drum,</HI> or <HI>Hurricane.</HI>)</P>
<P>FASHION, a polite Term of Excuse for all the Vices that can be thought of.</P>
<P><PB N="236" REF="239"/>NATURE, Nothing at all; it is often called <HI>Plastic Nature, universal Nature,</HI> &amp;c. but the Idea is always the same.</P>
<P>ROUT, formerly signified the Defeat of an Army, and when the Soldiers were all put to flight or to the Sword, they were said to be routed. The Ladies, in order to preserve some Idea of <HI>Cressi, Poitiers, Blenheim,</HI> &amp;c. have agreed to call their Assemblies by the Name of <HI>Routs.</HI> This, it is thought, they do with more Propriety, as frequently at these Meetings whole Families are en∣tirely <HI>routed</HI> out of House and Home.</P>
<P>SOUI. It was formerly believed, that in each human Creature there existed something incorruptible, which was not to perish with the Dissolution of our Bodies, but to be removed to some other Part of the Universe, and there to enjoy the Reward due to Virtue, or suffer condign Punishment for all Transgressions, while in this State of Probation. But the happy Discovery of the Properties of Matter has also banished this absurd Doc∣trine, which serves now to embellish the Fictions of Poets.</P>
<P>IMMENSE, an Epithet of Praise, thus we say <Q>an immense fine Woman, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> (vide <HI>Damned.</HI></Q>)</P>
<P>VIRTUE, The antient <HI>Druids</HI> made it a Rule to keep all their Passions in due Government, by which Mean, they were never known to prejudice their Neigh∣bours, or hurt their own Constitutions by Intemperance; and this Practice, it is probable, was signified by the Word <HI>Virtue.</HI> It is used by <HI>Shakespear, Spencer, Milton, Pope,</HI> and other Poets, as a pretty Ornament for their romantic Performances. (Vide <HI>Friendship.)</HI></P>
<P>PITY, This is also an old <HI>English</HI> Word, the Mean∣ing of which cannot be traced; it is now a Word of Course, when we do not care a Farthing for a Friend in Affliction.</P>

<BIBL><HI>VIRG.</HI></BIBL></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">O</SEG>UR Club met a few Nights since at the <HI>Devil</HI> Tavern, when the Conversation principally turned upon Topics of Litera∣ture, and particularly dramatic Poetry. Many of our best modern Tragedies were examined, and I observed it was frequently said of Pieces con∣fessedly inartificial in the Fable, unforcible in Senti∣ment, and destitute of Character, that they contained a very fine Vein of Poetry. Our Professor of Criticism immediately objected to the Propriety of the Expression. He did not understand how a bad Play could have fine Poetry, and he has formed a Plan for a Set of Papers, which may throw some Light on this Matter. I shall this Day present my Readers with one, which I think may serve as an Opening to the Design.</P>
<P>In order to decide upon the Excellence or Imper∣fection of any Art, it is necessary to know the original Intent and Aim of that Art, and also the several Means by which it accomplishes its Designs. The bet∣ter to investigate this, with regard to any Branch of Li∣terature, it will be expedient to trace all Manner of Composition to its Source, and thence to pursue the se∣veral Rivulets which have streamed from it. This has been done with great Perspicuity and Elegance by the Author of the Essays on the Characteristics, who has very justly determined the three primary Branches of Composition to be, <HI>Poetry, Eloquence,</HI> and <HI>Argument.</HI> He adds, that a just Coalition of the three forms the con∣summate Beauty of fine Writing, and then, continues
<PB N="239" REF="242"/>he, <Q>it would be perhaps both a new and pleasing Speculation to point out the Writers in their several Kinds, who have been most remarkably excellent, or defective with Regard to the just Union of these three Species of Cemposition. At present it must suffice to have hinted such a Criticism, which the Reader may easily prosecute.</Q> Such a Criticism might distinguish the respective Graces of all Kinds of Writing, and furnish the Criterions by which to judge of the proper Beauties of each different Species. I shall now beg Leave to offer a few cursory Reflections on this Subject; and, in order to proceed with the greater Perspicuity, shall attempt a short Account of the Rise of the three Modes of Writing already mentioned.</P>
<P>Man being a sociable Creature, it was necessary, that certain Signs, universally agreed upon, should be used for the reciprocal Conveyance of his Ideas. Sounds, which we call Words, were the quickest Vehicles, and therefore grew into general Use. According as our Stock of Ideas enIarged itself, the Demand for Words became more extensive, and as Societies were framed, and People assembled by civil Policy, Intercourse begot further Acquisitions, and thus, Language was daily en∣larged. But it being impossible that every distinct Idea should be expressed by a Term appropriated to it, the Mind naturally had Recourse to the Faculty of Reason, which compares, distinguishes, and separates the Ideas which have passed through the Senses, or have been formed into different Combinations by the Power of Imagination. By these Means, a Similitude was dis∣covered between sundry various Images, and thence it followed, that Things were expressed by borrowed Names, on account of a Resemblance existing between them. The Term thus transferred was called a <HI>Meta∣phor,</HI> and, as it happens in the commercial Intercourse of Mankind, what was at firist introduced out of Neces∣sity, became, in Process of Time, an absolute Luxury.
<PB N="240" REF="243"/>This the Poets soon perceived; and as it was their Busi∣ness to lead uncultivated Multitudes from their Huts and Dens, by seizing their Imaginations with their Songs and Ballads, the Metaphor soon appeared to them to be an effectual Means of painting Things in warmer Colours to the Fancy, which is ever greatly de∣lighted when any new and unforeseen Assemblage is offered to its View. The Epithet which denotes the Qualities inherent in all Objects, lent its auxiliary Aid, and Poetry, with these adventitious Ornaments became the Delight of Mankind.</P>
<P>But the Matter did not rest here; as Cities were mul∣tiplied, and as States enlarged themselves, artificial Passions began to operate; Ambition then began to grasp at Power and Pre-eminence, and <HI>Envy, Jealousy, Revenge</HI> and <HI>Malice</HI> sowed the Seeds of Discord, and mutual Distrust; and thus while they were distracted with intestine Commotions, the adjacent States, desirous of extending their Possessions, made Inroads upon them. In these Emergencies there was not Time for the mea∣sured Writer to produce his poetic Composition; an immediate Address was requisite to influence the Pas∣sions of the Multitude, and therefore Men of Genius came forth, and destitute of Number, addressed the People in humble Prose. But here, still the Attention was to be fixed, and therefore they could not divest themselves of all the Properties of Poetry, but continued to address themselves to the Imagination of their Au∣ditors, and thus to influence their Passions and perswade them to their own Good. As the least Appearance of a Design upon their Understandings on these Occasions would totally defeat itself, it thence resulted, that all those ambitious Ornaments, and all those gaudy Colour∣ings, which Poetry spreads so lavishly on every Subject, were here introduced with a more sparing Hand, and the Imagination was only addressed as it affords various Accesses to the Passions. In this Manner Eloquence
<PB N="241" REF="244"/>deduced its being; and was only a less luxuriant Kind of Poetry, which endeavoured to practise the Arts of Persuasion, and to win over the Passions of the People to its own End and Use.</P>
<P>In Proportion as Mankind became enlightened, as Arts and Manufactures encreased, and as Science ex∣tended itself, it was not enough that <HI>Poetry</HI> charmed with its graceful Combinations, and that <HI>Eloquence</HI> awakened and agitated the Passions; <HI>Reason</HI> began then to exert its Influence, to look for Utility and Truth in every Composition, and stripping away the Luxuriances of lavish Description, it began cooly and dispassionately to consider every Thing that was offered. Hence sprung the <HI>Didactic,</HI> or the Argumentative; <HI>Demosthenes</HI> was obliged to proceed by fair Deductions, and as much as possible to conceal his Art from a People, who were so polished, that they would have despised those Arts of Persuasion, which <HI>Tully</HI> practised with Success upon Minds less artful and less informed than the <HI>Greeks.</HI></P>
<P>In this Manner, it appears to me, these three pri∣mary Branches of Composition arose in the World, each being plainly deducible from the very Principles of our Constitution. For as the Imagination is the warmest Faculty of the Soul, <HI>Poetry,</HI> whose principal Intent is to please, is particularly addressed to this Power of Perception. <HI>Eloquence,</HI> though more chaste and reserved in its Embellishments, strikes chiefly at the Passions, and as they are then most powerfully excited, when Fancy pictures strong Appearances of Good or Evil. <HI>Eloquence</HI> is obliged to have Recourse to the Regions of Imagination, in order to render its Co∣lourings stronger and more glowing; and further, as the Province of <HI>Reason</HI> is to compare its Ideas, and to form various Affirmations or Negations relative to them, the <HI>Didactic</HI> is principally confined to this Province. There are not in human Nature any other Inlets of Per∣ception, or any other Faculties of Sensation to which
<PB N="242" REF="245"/>the Art of a Writer could apply, and therefore the Imagination, the Passions, and Reason are justly the three Springs of Composition. But Men of Refine∣ment and Reflection, perceiving what a powerful Influ∣ence any one of these Branches of Writing has upon the Mind, have thence inferred, that the joint Force of all three united, must carry the Power of Genius to still a greater Degree of Perfection, and, therefore, in whatever Way they were engaged, they have made it their Business to make Excursions into their Neighbours Territories, and borrow thence several Improvements to heighten their Productions. As for Instance, in like Manner, as <HI>Eloquence</HI> has learned from <HI>Poetry</HI> to warm and enliven the Imagination, <HI>Poetry</HI> has marked the Influence of <HI>Eloquence</HI> on the Passions, and has en∣deavoured to glide to the Heart through the same In∣lets; and both have also found it necessary to recom∣mend themselves to <HI>Reason,</HI> and have occasionally strengthened themselves with Insertions of the <HI>Didactic.</HI> The reasoning Faculty has, in its Turn, perceived, that a mere Train of Deductions would be too dry, and therefore it takes Occasion to adorn itself with the Flowers of Imagination, and, in some Speculations, it even endeavours to awaken the Passions.</P>
<P>Hence then it appears, that a Concurrence of the primary Branches of Writing is requisite in all Works of Genius; but, as there is some Danger of running Riot, and making too frequent and unjustifiable Pro∣gresses into each others Territories, it was necessary to fix the Boundaries of each Kind, and to determine how far any one of them may indulge itself in its Approaches towards the others, in order to preserve the essential Dif∣ference in every Composition, to observe the proper Qualities, and the just Colourings of each; or as <HI>Horace</HI> has it,
<Q><HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>nctas servare vices operumque colores.</HI></Q></P>
<P><PB N="243" REF="246"/>There are in Nature but few original Colours, and it is from the Meltings and Softenings of these into each other, that all other Appearances to the Eye derive their Origin. It is the fame in Writing; the several Species of it, which are now practised, are Modes of <HI>Poetry, Eloquence</HI> and <HI>Argument</HI> differently blended. How far the Union is just, shall be occasionally exa∣mined in a few detached Essays; and by these Means we shall see the peculiar Merit of an <HI>Epic Poem,</HI> a <HI>Tra∣gedy,</HI> a <HI>Comedy,</HI> &amp;c. and the Reader may at his Leisure carry the Research into several subordinate Branches of Writing.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">Y</SEG>OU have long since listed yourself in the Service of the Fair; as a Volunteer in the same Cause, I now take the Liberty to address this Letter to you, which will, be∣fore I have done, sufficiently unfold me and my Call∣ing. I am induced to it, by an Advertisement in the common News Papers, calculated merely for the Use of the rougher Sex, without any Regard to the weak, but lovely, Part of the Creation, who stand most in need of adventitious Aids, to guide them in an Age of Vice and Folly. The Advertisement I mean is as follows:</P>
<Q><P><HI>Gentlemen that are inclined for Marriage.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I have daily fresh deplorable Reasons to press you to fly to me to prepare for that important Statc; if my Advice
<PB N="245" REF="248"/>only is wanting, you shall have it, without any View of Return, and, let what will be wanting, be assured the Emclument or Pleasure I shall have from the Institu∣tion, will chiefly consist in that sweetest of Sensations, which the Heart feels in having relieved the Distressed, or in∣spirited the Languid. I have by hard Study found out Medicines that will give perfect Redress to any afflicted with the venereal Infection, or Weakness of Body, from any Injuries, in a short Time—from Mr.</HI> J. O. <HI>Hospital Surgeon, opposite the</HI> Auditor's-Office, <HI>in</HI> Upper Scotland-Yard, <HI>near</HI> White-Hall. <HI>N. B. The strictest Honour may be depended on.</HI></P></Q>
<P>Would not one imagine, upon Perusal of the first Part of this Advertisement, that it is the Effusion of Benevo∣lence in some Clergyman, prompted by a laudable Zeal to encourage the Observance of the Commandment for the Propagation of the Species, and add his Efforts to strengthen the late Marriage Act. <HI>To prepare for that important State.</HI>—Does not this Expression suggest Ideas of our awful Religion, and the solemn Institution esta∣blished by it?—And then how disinterested is the sweetest of his Sensations!—It does not lie in the Palm of his Hand, but plays around his generous Heart, and is an Indication of a pure and extensive Charity. On read∣ing a little further, it however appears, that Mr. <HI>J. O.</HI> has only assumed the Appearance of a Parson, like Sir <HI>John Brute</HI> in the Play, for a Frolick, and, when you are just upon the Point of enquiring if he has any Cure, he cries out very frankly, <HI>"an excellent Cure for a Clap,"</HI> As Surgery is now arrived to a very great Degree of Per∣fection, I do not doubt but the last Assertion may be very true; but as to his Preparations for the important State of Matrimony, we are quite lest in the Dark. But be it the Business of the Men to make farther Enquiries about this his boasted <HI>Nostrum.</HI> As I do not propose to con∣cern myself, in the Course of my Practice, with the Lords of the Creation, being devoted entirely to the Service of
<PB N="246" REF="249"/>the Ladies. I shall now proceed to offer my own Adver∣tisement, which, I hope, will be attended with very good Consequence.</P>
<Q><P><HI>To the Ladies inclined to Matrimony.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Never were ner<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ous Decays less frequent than at pre∣sent, which has induced me to press you to enter into the married Life, as you will not, in the present Glow of Health, be in any Danger of converting your Bed-Cham∣ber to Nurseries for your Husbands, nor have any Oc∣casion to lie with your Footmen. To prepare you for the important State, I have, with infinite Pains, devised a</HI> Recipe, <HI>which cannot fail to procure you good Offers very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, and to make the married State compleatly happy.</HI></P>
<P>N. B. <HI>I have the Honour of having Mr.</HI> Keith, <HI>late of</HI> May-Fair, <HI>to vouch for my being regularly bred at the</HI> Hand and P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, <HI>and always a zealous Promoter of Mar∣riage before the late Act. From</HI> Q. D. G. <HI>near</HI> May∣hair-Chappel.</P></Q>
<P>I know the World in general is apt to form very dis∣advantageous Ideas of us advertising Doctors; but I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> have to assure Mr. <HI>Ranger,</HI> that the above is not in the ordinary Way of puffing, but to promote the real benefit of the Community. I have obtained a Patent for the sole vending my Composition for the Space of Fourteen Years; and, to convince you of its Efficacy, I will hereby inform the World of the Ingredients, which are in the Possession of so few, that I am not apprehensive of having my Business taken out of my Hands. The component Parts of those admirable Powders, with which Heaven has enabled Doctor <HI>James</HI> to preserve, as it were by Proxy, the Lives and Constitutions of Mil∣lions, are all very well known; but it is in the Propor∣tion of the Mixture, and the whole Process of the Pre∣paration, that the Secret lies. In like Manner my Me∣dicine will save me the Trouble of crying out, <Q><HI>Beware of Counterfeits, for such are abroad.</HI></Q> As it will be im∣possible
<PB N="247" REF="250"/>to offer any Mixture to the Public, that will not immediately be liable to Detection, the Ingredients are as follow: <Q><HI>Good-Manners, Good-Humour, an Abstinence from Politicks, an Aversion from Cards, mo∣destly to keep the Neck and Shoulders covered, Dislike of Scandal, Pride, Levity, Folly, Humility, Discretion, Scorn of Fools, Reserve, Dissimulation, Vanity, Frank∣ness, Truth, Neatness, Honour, Sobriety and Mirth.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Among these it appears there are some Poisons; but these, properly tempered, and counterballanced by op∣posite Qualities, will, I venture to pronounce it, get a young Lady a Husband, and ensure mutual Happiness, better than any Thing hitherto devised.</P>
<P>Instead of producing a large Number of Vouchers for the salutary Effects already felt from my Medicine, I shall close my Letter with the History of two female Reigns; for every Beauty is, for a Time, the Queen of her Admirers. The first is that of a beautiful Tyrant, who made a wrong Use of her Power; the second, of a more discreet Sovereign, who had recourse to the above Recipe.</P>
<P><HI>MARIA</HI> ascended the Throne of Beauty in the eigh∣teenth Year of her Age; immediately upon her Acces∣sion, she dissolved her Parliament, turned out of her Privy-Council every Person of Sense and Discretion, and introduced, in their Room, a <HI>French</HI> Hair-Cutter, two Milliners, a Chambermaid, and many other Personages of equal Rank and Condition. By the Advice of these Assistants she reigned with despotic Sway. She heard the Complaints of her Slaves without ever feeling the least Propensity to a Redress of their Grievances, which occasioned violent Heart-burnings, and at Length called forth a Shoal of Writers against her Government, as generally happens in all political States, when the supreme Power is abused. A Num∣ber of Sonnetteers, Libellers, and Epigrammatists, who
<PB N="248" REF="251"/>daily poured forth Treason against her Beauty, and pro∣nounced her born to enslave Mankind. She had a very particular Pleasure in signing metaphorical Death. War∣rants for her Votaries; and she looked upon the whole Race of Mankind formed to flatter her Vanity, and to pay her Adoration. She exacted Tributes of Admi∣ration at such an exorbitant Rate, that at last an <HI>Hamb∣den</HI> arose, who disputed with her a Contribution of In∣cences which she insisted upon. This Proceeding open∣ed the Eyes of the rest of her Subjects, who all con∣spired to dethrone her in the twenty-third Year of her Age; and then fell the Tyrant <HI>Maria,</HI> without one to lament her Fall, after a short Reign of five Years, in which she conquered with so wild a Rage, as the Poet has it, that, with the universal Joy, succeeded to her, the fair <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> whose Reign commenced, like a mild Evening after the violent Scorching of a hot Summer's Day.</P>
<P><HI>ELIZABETH</HI> endeavoured to render herself the Mistress of all willing Hearts, and valued herself more upon the Love of her Subjects, than any idle Flattery she might extort from them. The Poet's Description was perfectly adapted to her;
<Q><L><HI>Favours to none, to all she Smiles extends;</HI></L>
<L><HI>Ost she rejects, but never once offends.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>She had no She-Friends in her Cabinet-Council, but guided herself entirely by the Directions of Prudence, Virtue, and good Sense. An <HI>Essex,</HI> at length, insinu∣ated himself more particularly into her good Graces; but she had such a Command over her Passions, that she never disgraced him by a Blow, but, in the End, took him as an Associate into her Empire, which she, in a short Time, finally resigned, in order to enjoy the calmer Gratifications of a domestic Life, where she now shines with every amiable Grace, while <HI>Toasts</HI> and other
<PB N="249" REF="252"/>ambitious Beauties fatigue their Eyes, and weary every Feature, in vain, to gain them Admirers.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Author of my Motto was one of the best Crities the World has ever produced, and he has, in the above Lines, comprised the three principal Qualities of Poetry. Its Aim, says he, is to afford at once Utility and De∣light, to offer what may be agreeable to the Fancy, and also what may conduce to the Advantages of hu∣man Life. He further adds, it is not enough for a Poem to abound in Prettynesses, it must also have a sweet Access to the Heart, and should be able to agitate the Soul with what Passions it pleases. This Description involves all the leading Requisites of Poetry; and, it is
<PB N="251" REF="254"/>remarkable, includes the three primary Branches of Composition, exhibited in a former Paper, <HI>viz.</HI> the Art of addressing our <HI>Reason,</HI> in order to be useful, the Imagination, to be agreeable, and the Passions, in order to persuade and gain upon our Affections. Here then we have <HI>Poesy, Eloquence,</HI> and <HI>Argument</HI> united, and most assuredly, that Performance will be found the most excellent in its Kind, which is the most highly finished with Regard to these three Essentials.</P>
<P><HI>Epic</HI> Poetry has always had the Pre-eminence, and, I suppose, the Reason of this Determination, is, be∣cause it affords the freest and most ample Room for a Display of the three primary and original Species of Writing, It is by observing how these friendly Colours mix and blend with each other, that we are to deduce a Judgment upon the different Authors, who have proved any Way eminent in the literary World, refer∣ing to the first Principles, being the only Criterion in every Art. <HI>Bossu</HI> and other Critics have informed us, that the epic Fable must involve one entire Action; that this Action must have a Beginning, a Middle, and an End; They have told us, that the Poet must not take up the Thread of his Narrative too near the Clue; but that he must hasten into the Midst of Things, and oc∣casionally give a Retrospect to such Things as are ne∣cessary to be known. They have treated largely of the Machinery, of the Time the Fable should include, with many other Particulars, which though proper to be explained, do not any Way conduce to the Refine∣ment of Taste, or the Improvement of true Genius. It is most certain; by observing from what Principles in the human Frame each Art is deducible, that any real or valuable Criticism can be formed.</P>
<P>It is manifest then, that the Epic Writer has free Latitude of inserting all the Graces of every Kind of Composition. All Nature lies at his Command; where∣ever
<PB N="252" REF="255"/>he casts his Eyes, he is Lord of the Manor; he can turn a Road, by poetical Act of Parliament, through Lawns and Groves, and Scenes of Pasturage; the four Seasons obey his Directions, and he need never be at a Loss for agreeable Exhibitions of Nature, to please the Imagination. The whole System of Ethics is also his; he may frequently take occasion to improve his Read∣ers by short Sentences, and transient Reflections on hu∣man Life, and by these Means he may gain upon our Reason to approve his Performances. The whole Art of Eloquence is likewise perfectly open to the Epic Au∣thor, and from thence he may derive an irresistible Power over our Passions. In this last mentioned Requi∣site the <HI>Abbé du Bos</HI> places the consummate Persection of fine Poetry. Certain it is, the Mind of Man never feels such intense Pleasure from any of the imitative Arts, as when its Passions are awakened, and it finds itself roused from an impassive State, and unexpectedly agitated by the skilful Touches of a Master-poet. The Author just quoted ascribes this ideal Appearance to the Satisfaction which the Soul enjoys at the Perception of its own Acti∣vity: May we not add to this, what is suggested, if I re∣member right, by the Author of <HI>The Pleasure of the Ima∣ginations?</HI> "Our moral Sense receives on the Occasion an additional Delight, to see that the social Affections are in Harmony' and Proportion, and feelingly awake to the due Sensations of Humanity; and this, in Conjunction with the Gratifications, which we are apt to take in comparing the Ideas, which Reality has suggested, with those excited by the Art of Imitation, conspire to ren∣der a warm and well-executed Passage in Poetry, so agreeable to all Mankind in general."</P>
<P>Were I to declare in which of the three Powers of the Mind, already mentioned, I think <HI>Homer, Virgil</HI> and <HI>Milton,</HI> to be most eminently shining; I should as∣cribe
<PB N="253" REF="256"/>to <HI>Homer</HI> the strongest and most vigorous Efforts of Imagination, and an amazing Faculty of alarming us with noble and amazing Descriptions of all the magni∣ficent Objects in Nature. As to our own <HI>Milton,</HI> I should be inclined to declare him a Rival of the <HI>Greek</HI> Poet, for a comprehensive Sublimity of Conception: and <HI>Virgil</HI>'s Excellence I should place in beautiful Touches of poetic Eloquence. His whole fourth Book I take to be a Master-piece in this Way. The various Agita∣tions of Mind which <HI>Dido</HI> endures, her Love, her Jea∣lousy, her Rage, her Tenderness, her many mixed Emotions, are perhaps the finest Strokes in Poetry. In his sixth Book also there are several Scenes of the most tender Nature; and, in the ninth Book, the Grief of the Mother, after the Death of <HI>Nisus</HI> and <HI>Euryalus,</HI> and the Lamentations of <HI>Evander,</HI> are all to be ranked in the same Class, and, in my Opinion, af∣ford a Pleasure, not to be met with in either of the other Poets, even though <HI>Homer</HI> has succeeded so well in <HI>Hector</HI>'s last Scene with <HI>Andromache,</HI> and though our great <HI>Mil∣ton</HI> has a great Deal of finely impassionated Dialogue in his justly celebrated Poem. <HI>Virgil</HI> more frequently applies himself to the Passions of his Readers than the other two; and, notwithstaneing some pretty strong Improbabilities, he does not so frequently shock our Reason, as the <HI>Grecian</HI> Poet, who certainly, in some Particulars, is extravagant to the highest Degree. <HI>Mil∣ton</HI> has the Advantage of having founded his Story up∣on Traditions, which our Religion has sanctified, other∣wise I should consider his fallen Angels, and the War waged by them, together with the Invention of Can∣non, and many other Circumstances, highly chimerical, even though they expand our Fancy with grand and surprizing Appearances.</P>
<P>I shall take another Opportunity to consider how far Tragedy may dispute with the Epic for the Preference,
<PB N="254" REF="257"/>and shall only add at present, that I have ever been of Opinion, that all the Writers of heroic Poesy have, in general, been too fond of the Marvellous. By this I would not be understood to censure the Use of Machinery, which, when introduced with Sobriety and Discretion, serves to present agreeable Scenery to the Mind; and I could wish that the Correctness of Mr. <HI>Glover</HI>'s Judg∣ment had not entirely excluded it from his Poem of <HI>Leo∣nidas,</HI> which certainly has many Passages of warm po∣etic Eloquence, many Pieces of beautiful Imagery, and several Strictures of useful and improving Morality, artfully interwoven with the Ground-work of his Fable.</P>
<P>I shall beg leave to conclude with an Observation, which is not entirely foreign to the Purpose. It is re∣marked by Mr. <HI>Addison,</HI> that <HI>Virgil</HI> has but one Conceit throughout his Poem, and that, says he, is put into the Mouth of the young <HI>Julus,</HI> when, with a Kind of punning Ambiguity, he observes, that they are eating their Tables. But surely the great Critic had forgot the Passage, where the Poet tells us, that <HI>Aeneas,</HI> in runuing round a Tree after the flying <HI>Turnus,</HI> follows the Man who follows him.—<HI>Sequiturque sequentem.</HI></P>
<P>This, tried by the Rule of <HI>Bohours,</HI> appears to have Truth for its Foundation; but it is so childish a Truth, that I am sorry to find it intermixed with the Majesty of the <HI>Aeneid;</HI> but, perhaps, it is like the Fly on the Picture, which a minute Observer was going to brush away, and then found it was placed there on purpose by the Hand of the Artist.</P>

<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">M</SEG>IRGEHAN</HI> was a Peasant in the De∣sarts of <HI>Arabia;</HI> he frequently begged an Alms of the Travellers in the passing Ca∣ravan. For along Time he drove the loaded Camel over Mount <HI>Pharan</HI> for a Jeweller of <HI>Cairo,</HI> and having at length by an amazing Parsimony, got together a few Sequins of Gold, he followed the Occupation of his Master. Affairs thrived so well with him, that in the Course of a few Years <HI>Mirgehan</HI> began to assume to himself the Pride of Wealth, and his Countenance, which formerly was humbled by Poverty and a Dejection of Spirits, began to brighten into Gleams of Self-Satisfaction. In order to extend his Interest, and enlarge his Schemes for the Accumulation of Wealth, <HI>Mirgehan,</HI> now basking under the Sun∣shine of his Fortune, resolved to remove to <HI>Bafra,</HI> where he was soon distinguished as the most eminent Merchant of the Place. As it is the Nature of Ambition to be ever restless and unsatisfied, after having, in the Course of six Years Residence, amassed a very ample Fortune, he determined with himself to change his Abode once more, and settle himself, with all his im∣mense Wealth, at <HI>Bagdad.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Mingehan</HI> was no sooner fixed at <HI>Bagdad,</HI> than the Re∣putation
<PB N="257" REF="260"/>of his Affluence spread itself abroad. In all convivial Meetings among the rest of the Merchants, as soon as his Lips seemed to open, every Tongue was suspended with Silence, every Eye gazed at him with Admiration, and every Ear devoured the Periods of his Story with greedy Earnestness. His Voice, which naturally was as rough as the Sound occasioned by a Collision of Billows on the Ocean, now seemed as fost as the fragrant Gale, which pants upon the Leaves of the <HI>Arabian</HI> Trees.</P>
<P>By this Time <HI>Mirgehan</HI>'s Credit was become so exten∣sive, that People of all Ranks and Conditions deposited their Money with him, and he had every Day a very great Number of Servants counting over the Se∣quins of Gold, which he was either to receive or pay away for others. In the Midst of all these Smiles of Fortune, it happened, that the Relict of a rich Merchant, lately snatched away from the Face of the Earth, by the Angel of Death, attracted his Attention. Her Name was <HI>Dardanè,</HI> born in the City of <HI>Damas,</HI> and now in the Possession of very great Wealth. From the Habits, which Education and Time had implanted in her, she was in her Temper of a most greedy Avarice, and a powerful Ambition to be counted richer than the rest of her Acquaintance; urged by these Instigations, she be∣stowed her lovely Form upon <HI>Mirgehan,</HI> who, in a short Time, so contrived it, that the Roses faded on her Cheek, the Lilly appeared of a yellower Hue, and by flow Degrees, her Constitution received such severe Strokes from his Severity, that she totally pined away, and, in a short Time, lay breathless on her Bed.</P>
<P><HI>Mirgehan</HI> was now happy in the Completion of his Wishes; he had got rid of a Wife, whom, notwith∣standing her exquisite Beauty, his Soul ever abhorred, and he exulted in the Review of the vast Accession to his Fortune, which, through her Means, he had ob∣tained.
<PB N="258" REF="261"/>His Heatt now began to expand with greater Alacrity, and he resolved to spend the Remainder of his Days in Ease, in Elegance, in Luxury, and every delicate Enjoyment. The Dainties of the East did not suffice to crown his Board; he would send to the West for <HI>Turtle,</HI> and every Corner of the Globe administred to his Gratifications. Not far from <HI>Bagdad,</HI> he purchased a most elegant and magnificent House, where he deter∣mined to fix his country Retreat. The Rooms eter∣nally resounded with Singers and Minstrels; Amber and Aloes contributed their rich Perfumes; and his Tables were covered with Vases of Agate, filled with the most delicious Liquors. Painting and Sculpture con∣curred to adorn his Apartments. <HI>Mirgehan</HI> was led into all this Profusion by an irresistible Vanity, from which he derived many exquisite Sensations of Pleasure; when he found his Wealth and his Possessions admired, he the more readily suffered himself to be governed by this Turn of Mind, from a Conviction, that all his grand Appearance of Affluence, served to extend his Reputation, and that, in Consequence of his extensive Credit, he should have ample and frequent Opportuni∣ties of re-imbursing himself, by the Use he knew to make of the pecuniary Confidence, which others re∣posed in him.</P>
<P><HI>Mirgehan</HI> was now happy in all the Enjoyments which Riches could procure him; his Heart danced to per∣petual Tunes of Joy, and the Meanness of his Birth he thought sufficiently compensated by the Lustre and Dig∣nity of his present Way of Life. And now, to com∣pleat his Elevation, and to raise himself to that Point of Eminence, from which he imagined, he might look down upon most of his Fellow-Creatures, Fortune, who had for a Series of Years smiled propitiously upon all the Undertakings of <HI>Mirgehan,</HI> at length presented an Opportunity.</P>
<P><PB N="259" REF="262"/>It happened, that the Emperor of <HI>Bagdad</HI> had Occa∣sion, on a particular Emergence in his Affairs, to call together an Assembly of the wisest and ablest Heads in his Territories, in order to assist his Councils, to help him in framing salutary Laws, for the due Regulation of his Subjects, and to point out proper Measures for him to levy the Monies necessary towards defraying the Expences of his Soldiers, and other Contingences in Government. The <HI>Califf</HI> resolved upon this Step, with the Advice of his <HI>Vizir,</HI> and, in a few Days, Mandates were dispatched to sundry different Parts, commanding the Provinces and Towns to depute to the general Di∣van, two Persons the most renowned for Sagacity and Judgment. <HI>Mirgehan</HI> was at his Country-Seat, when he heard this News, and his Passions being violent as the eddying Sand during a Tempest; he instantly con∣ceived a Desire to be enrolled among the most distin∣guished Politicians of <HI>Bagdad.</HI></P>
<P>Accordingly he forthwith set out upon this Expedi∣tion; but he had not gone far from his own Habitation, when travelling a solitary Road, over a long extended Mountain, the Heat of the Day, together with the Fatigue he had undergone, inclined him to stop under a shady Retreat, and refresh his Senses with a gentle Slumber. From this he was soon awakened by a Strain of Musick, which thrilled so melodiously in his Ears, that he thought Gleams of Paradise were opening to his dazled Sight. He looked around, and saw a reverend Form advance towards him; <HI>Mirgehan</HI> arose from the Arbour, in which he was reclined; and instantly throw∣ing himself on his Knees, he worshipped the venerable Appearance which stood before him. This Personage was an holy Hermit, who long inhabited a small Man∣sion on the Side of a Rock, which terminated the Pro∣spect on the left Side of the Mountain. Being endowed with a magic Power, he called forth to his Sight such
<PB N="260" REF="263"/>beautiful Scenes, as looked like a new Creation. <HI>Mir∣gehan</HI>'s Heart throbbed with holy Rapture. At length the hoary Sage began. <Q><HI>Mirgehan,</HI> I know thy Pur∣pose; I am acquainted with thy Design in this thy Journey. But reflect, O Man! on the Obscurity of thy Birth, and the Meanness of thy Education. Canst thou confer Light to the Councils of the Wise? Canst thou dispel the Mist from before their Eyes, and let in powerful Irradiations of Truth upon their darkling Understandings? Desist, vain Man, from thy ill-founded Pursuits.</Q> At these Words the vene∣rable Hermit waved his Wand, and suddenly the Scene vanished like a Morning-Dream from <HI>Mirgehan</HI>'s Eyes. After having again raised his Arm; <Q>Now, says he, let the Objects that are placed before thee instruct thy Soul; there behold how easily thou mightest have squandered away all those Possessions, which thy Soul delights in for a mere empty Bubble. There see an Election for two Persons to assist in the Debates for the Ease and Happiness of the Califf, and his People; see the Blind, the Lame, the Old, the In∣firm, the Sick arriving in Caravans, to vote for those who pay them highest. See how they all solemnly vow by the holy Prophet, that Money has no Influ∣ence upon them; and yet behold how in private they grasp the Sequins of Gold! Does not thy Heart, which has fixed all its Affections upon thy yellow Dirt, tremble within thee, to think that in this Man∣ner all thy Wealth might be squandered away, and thou not be able to render the least Service to the Califf, thy Country, or thy Family? That this is the Fate of many, who, like thee, have arose from mean Beginnings, and have, in their old Days, proved mere Spendthrifts, thou may'st receive ocular Demonstration, by surveying those Wretches, who are now despised by their Country, detested by their
<PB N="261" REF="264"/>Relations, and despised by the <HI>Vizier,</HI> in whose Ser∣vice they exhausted all their Treasures.</Q></P>
<P>Here <HI>Zemroude</HI> (for that was the Hermit's Name) perceiving the Affections of <HI>Mirgehan</HI> perfectly changed, dispersed into the Air his new Creation, returned with solemn Step to his Cell under the Rock, and <HI>Mirgehan</HI> ordered his Camels to be turned towards <HI>Bagdad,</HI> where he spent the Remainder of his Days in Ease and Con∣tent; and, at his Death, he left those Sums of Gold, which he was going to squander in visionary Schemes, among his Relations, who now live in Affluence, and the Memory of <HI>Mirgehan</HI> is respected among them.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HERE is not a Species of Writing which has not had its particular Admirer, and various Affirmations have been made con∣cerning the Excellence of each. The famous Doctor <HI>South</HI> was of Opinion, that a complete Epigram is the Master-piece of Composition; and Mr. <HI>Addison</HI> calls a <HI>perfect Tragedy the noblest Production of Human Nature.</HI> The Truth of it is, each Person has delivered his Sentiments agreeably to his own private Temper, and his own peculiar Turn of Thinking. Doctor <HI>South</HI> excelled in lively and surprizing Strokes of Wit; every new Combination, which he formed in the vivacious Sallies of his Imagination, was Epi∣gram in itself, and we find all his Writings sown ex∣tremely thick with unexpected Assemblages; and on
<PB N="263" REF="266"/>this Account we may suppose him inclinable to extol his own favourite Talent. In like Manner, Mr. <HI>Addison</HI> had employed many of his Hours in planning his Tra∣gedy of <HI>Cato,</HI> and after it had received the most con∣summate Polish, which his Skill could bestow upon it, it was to be exhibited as the greatest Production of hu∣man Wit. But the Assertions of great Men, when they are unsustained by Argument, are not to be consi∣dered as Decrees from which there can be no Appeal: Tragedy most certainly can only claim the second Place, because it is manifest, that all the Powers of Genius, <HI>viz. Imagination, Eloquence</HI> and <HI>Reason,</HI> may be exerted in their full Force in the Epic Composition, whereas in Tragedy they frequently suffer great Limi∣tation. The same Thing, which on many Occasions makes Tragedy the most powerful Performance, serves also to divest it of those Advantages which give great Brilliancy to heroic Poesy, and that is, its coming im∣mediately before the Eye. It is justly remarked by <HI>Horace,</HI> that what is conveyed to our Notice through our Ears, acts with a more feeble Impulse upon the Mind, than Objects that pass through the Organs of Sight, those faithful Evidences in a mental Court of Judicature.</P>
<Q><L><HI>Segnius irritant animos demissa per Aurem,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Quam quae sunt Oculis subjecta fidelibus, &amp; quae</HI></L>
<L><HI>Ipse sibi tradit Spectator.—</HI></L></Q>
<P>For this Reason many Passages, in which the Epic Wrietr warms and expands the Imagination of his Readers with the noblest Exhibitions of poetic Imagery, are entirely excluded from the dramatic Scene; the Eye will not suffer itself easily to be deluded, and all the Amazement of Machinery is also for the same Reason totally superseded. A God, says the Critic, should
<PB N="264" REF="267"/>not be introduced, unless the Occasion should peremp∣torily require a supernatural Agent; he had said better, if he had absolutely interdicted the Appearance. We may in reading suffer such an Incident to be imposed upon us; but the Eye would be too much shocked with such Representations, and, of Course, the Mar∣vellous is entirely banished. Besides Tragedy will not admit any extraordinary Display of <HI>pure Poetry,</HI> or De∣scription; the heroic Poet for the most Part speaks in his own Person, and it is expected of him to pay great Court to our Imagination; but the Dialogue of Perso∣nages, engaged in a Sphere of Action, intended to interest the Auditors, will not allow them to take up the Scene with florid Exhibitions of rural Imagery; such as Brooks, murmuring in scanty Rills through peb∣bled Channels, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The following Lines in the Mouth of <HI>Calista</HI> in the <HI>Fair Penitent</HI> may be extremely picturesque, if considered as pure Description, but if considered with regard to the Situation of Character, they are certainly very inartificial and undramatic.</P>
<Q><L><HI>— my sad Soul</HI></L>
<L><HI>Has form'd a dismal melancholy Scene:</HI></L>
<L><HI>An unfrequented Vale, o'er grown with Trees,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Mossy and old, within whose lonesome Shade</HI></L>
<L><HI>Ravens and Birds ill-omen'd only dwell;</HI></L>
<L><HI>No Sound to break the Silence, but a Brook</HI></L>
<L><HI>That bubbling winds among the Weeds.</HI></L></Q>
<P>Hence then we find, that in the Regions of Fancy, the <HI>Drama</HI> must yield to the Epic, and as this is a very considerable Part of Poesy, I think it determines the Precedence. In the Art of Eloquence, and in all Applications to our Reason, Tragedy can boast full Room for the most vigorous Exertion. The <HI>Drama</HI> may be full as sentimental as any other Kind of Writ∣ings;
<PB N="265" REF="268"/>nay its Excellence frequently consists in being so, and with Regard to the Passions, the Mode of Imitation, renders its Influence more forcible, and when we are deceived into a Notion that the Personages are actually suffering Distress before our Eyes, the Performance as∣sumes a Kind of Reality, and more keen and intenser Sensations agitate our Breasts, than in Pieces where the Description is left to operate upon us without any other Aid than that of lively and impassioned Expressions. <HI>Virgil,</HI> I apprehend, was as skilful a Master of the Passions as any Writer, ancient or modern; and though the Passions of his <HI>Dido</HI> are drawn with as strong and glowing Colourings, as Language can bestow; though their various strugglings are all finely and closely marked, though all their Vicissitudes, Veerings and Doublings, if I may so call them, are finely touched; yet, I be∣lieve, <HI>Shakespear</HI>'s <HI>Lear</HI> and <HI>Othello</HI> have made much more lively and deep Impressions upon an Audience, than ever the former has done upon his Admirers in the Closet.</P>
<P>These Advantages, however, are derived to the tragic Queen from supernumerary Embellishments, and from the Labours of another Art, I mean that of acting, which is in itself a Mode of Imitation, and serves to render the Touches of the Writer more striking, and more feelingly expressive. This Superiority the Drama certainly has over the Epic, and in Consequence of all its additional Aids, it can boast a more powerful Com∣mand over the human Heart. It imitates the very Voice of Nature, and speaks the same simple and af∣fecting Language. All that Profusion of Figures, which mere Poetry admits, is discarded from the Stage. When I mention Figures, I must observe, that Men of critical Knowledge have justly distinguished between Figures of Speech, and Figures of the Sentiment; the former
<PB N="266" REF="269"/>including Metaphor and all Transtations of Phrases, and the latter consisting of such Breaks and Transitions in Discourse, as the Mind is known to make when under the Compunction of warring Passions. As for Instance, when the Poet says of <HI>Dido,</HI> that she is devoured by an inward Flame.
<Q><HI>Et caeco carpitur igne.</HI></Q> He then expresses Love by a sigurative Expression; but when he says,
<Q>Ignoscenda <HI>quidem, scirent si</HI> ignoscere <HI>manes.</HI></Q> The Repetition expresses the natural workings of the Mind, when other Ideas are awakened, and serve to ex∣cite a new Conflict of Passions. The use of these kind of Figures in Tragedy should be as free and bold as possible, and with Respect to Expression, no other Re∣gard is to be paid to it, than to chuse such Words as may be most significantly picturesque, in order to have the more lively Effect on the Imagination, the Passions being then in a stronger Ferment when lively Images are presented to the Fancy.</P>
<P>I believe our <HI>Shakespear</HI> is almost the only Poet who has excelled in a masterly Power of striking the <HI>Imagi∣nation,</HI> the <HI>Heart,</HI> and our <HI>Reason</HI> all at once; but in him Poetry, Sentiment, and Passion are combined in the most agreeable Assemblage. In his Tragedy of <HI>Macbeth,</HI> there are several surprizing Strokes of this <HI>Nature.</HI> Amidst a great Variety of Instances, the following Lines are introduced with a Solemnity suitable to the Occa∣sion, and they carry with them a pleasing Kind of gloomy Imagery.
<Q><L><HI>—E'er the Bat hath flown</HI></L>
<L><HI>His cl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sier'd Flight, e'er to black <HI>Hecate</HI>'s Summons</HI></L>
<L><HI>The Shard-born Beetle, with his drouzy Hums,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Hath rung Night's yawning Peal, there shall be done</HI></L>
<L><HI>A Deed of dreadful Note.—</HI></L></Q>
<PB N="267" REF="270"/>The Soliloquy in the Tent-Scene of <HI>Richard the Third</HI> is also a further Instance of the same Beauty, though by the Way it may not be improper to observe, notwith∣standing we must allow that Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI> was in the right to transplant <HI>Shakespear</HI>'s own Words, that they are not perfectly suitable to the Character of <HI>Richard;</HI> and I believe had our great Poet thought of shewing his Hero in this Situation, he would have shewed <HI>Richard</HI>'s Feel∣ings quite otherwise on such an Occasion.</P>
<P>To conclude: <HI>Aristotle</HI> was certainly mistaken when he called the Fable the Life and Soul of Tragedy; the Art of constructing the dramatic Story should always be subservient to the Exhibition of Character, our great <HI>Shakespear</HI> has breathed another Soul into Tragedy, which has found the Way of striking an Audience with Sentiment and Passion at the same Time.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>MONG all the Writers, who have dis∣canted on the <HI>British</HI> Constitution, I have not met with any one, that seems to be thoroughly acquainted with the Subject. An ingenious Friend of mine, who furnished me with an Essay some Time since, reduces our present Party-Divisions into <HI>Garrickeans</HI> and <HI>Barryists;</HI> but this is not going to the Bottom of Things. The famous <HI>Mon∣tesquien</HI> has performed, in my humble Apprehension, as little towards a Detection of the Root of the Evil, tho' he seems to perceive, with a Kind of prophetic Spirit, the Declension of <HI>British</HI> Liberty. The great <HI>Locke,</HI> who has treated, in a very masterly Manner of Government, does not any where give us a Clue to guide our Re∣search, and after glowing with <HI>Bolingbroke</HI> through a Number of Pages, we are as much in the Dark as ever. <HI>England</HI> can never be undone but by a Parliament, says the excellent Author of <HI>the Use and abuse of Parliaments;</HI> but even there, we are again put upon a wrong Scent. The Truth of the Matter is, ENGLAND CAN NEVER BE UNDONE BUT BY THE MOB. I am aware, this may at first Sight appear a Paradox; but a Retrospect to the Behaviour of that Body of People, will convince every intelligent Mind of the Truth of this Assertion.</P>
<P>The Generality of political Writers have wasted a great Deal of Paper in settling the various Forms of Government; one, say they, is a Monocracy; another is an Aristocracy; a third is a Democracy, and the <HI>British</HI> Constitution, they inform us, is of the mixed Spe∣cies;
<PB N="270" REF="273"/>consisting of a Coalition of all three. But furely a little Observation will point out to us, that they have all passed by unnoticed another Mode of civil Policy, which cannot be called by a better Name than a <HI>Mobo∣cracy,</HI> under which this Country has been for many Years past, and in all human Probability will continue so for a long Period still to come; nay, I will be bold to say, until Monocracy, Aristocracy, and Democracy are all swallowed up by this alone.</P>
<P>There is hardly ever a Bill brought before the ho∣nourable the House of Commons, but the Scope of it is immediately canvassed in an Assembly of the <HI>Mobo∣cracy;</HI> where if it passes in the Negative, a Deputation is forthwith sent by them to the Parliament-House, where, though their Remonstrances are not heard at the Bar, they nevertheless enforce their Arguments with such a truly <HI>British</HI> Eloquence, that they never fail to have a due Degree of Influence upon the Debates within Doors. On these Occasions, they generally make use of a Rule of Logick, which indeed is not mentioned by <HI>Aristotle,</HI> but which is always found of great Efficacy in all Di∣sputes. The Mode of Reasoning I mean, is the <HI>Argu∣mentum Boculinum,</HI> a nervous Exertion of which, ac∣companied with all the Force of the most vigorous Lungs, has over ruled many an intended Act, when it happens not to please in the Councils of the common People. The <HI>Mobecracy</HI> have further the legislative and executive Part of their Laws in their own Hands, and we find them very frequent in a diligent Attention to them. For Instance, though the common Law of <HI>Eng∣land</HI> has provided a proper Punishment for Pickpockets. The <HI>Mobocracy</HI> has reconsidered that Matter, and, after mature Deliberation, have devised a Correction, in their Opinion, more adequate to the Offence, and whenever any one is found to incur the Penalty of their Law, they immediately proceed to Execution, without Judge or Jury, which, in their Apprehension, serve but to retard
<PB N="271" REF="274"/>the Course of Justice, and therefore they seize the De∣linquent, and, without Delay, duck him in the River, the Canal in St. <HI>James</HI>'s Park, or the next Pool of Water. On all these Occasions, it is observable, that they take infinite Delight in seeing the proper Punish∣ment inflicted, as may be observed from the Acclama∣tions, the Huzzas &amp;<HI>c.</HI> wherewith their Burst of Joy rends the Air. In like Manner, the Pillory is some Times ordained by the Statute Law of <HI>England,</HI> in or∣der to expose such Transgressors as deserve to be set up the Marks of public Shame; on every Occurrence of this Nature, Wisdom is sure to cry out in the Streets, and the award of the Judges is determined by a popular Circle to be just or unjust. When once they have pro∣nounced Sentence, the Person doomed to make his Ap∣pearance is sure either to meet with their Protection, or to call forth the utmost Indignation of an incensed Populace. Nay, it has been known that these perpe∣tual Dictators have proceeded so far as to rescue Felons, condemned to suffer Death, from the Hands of the pro∣per Officers, and generously to have recalled the Death-Warrant. In many Parts of <HI>England</HI> they have an im∣placable Aversion to Turnpikes, and it is said they will never be at Rest, until they have entirely demolished those disagreeable Passports. I remember to have heard a Story of these People, which I think may serve to give the Reader a tolerable Idea of their arbitrary Power. Not very long since three <HI>Indian</HI> Kings came to visit this Metro∣polis, and, after they had seen most Places of Curiosity, a Play was at length advertized by Command of their <HI>Indian</HI> Majesties. The <HI>Mobocracy,</HI> who have entirely exploded all Notions of the Right Divine of Kings, and who, in Fact, consider crowned Heads as no more than common Men, took care to attend at the Theatre-Royal in <HI>Drury-Lane,</HI> in order to survey the swarthy Monarchs. At length the Curtain drew up, but in vain did the Players attempt to begin the Diversion of
<PB N="272" REF="275"/>the Night The <HI>Mobocracy,</HI> who had Possession of the Upper Gallery, declared that they came to see the Kings, <Q>and since we have said our Money, the Kings we will have.</Q> Whereupon Mr. <HI>Wilks,</HI> who was then one of the Patentees, came forth and assured them that the Kings were in the Front-Box; to this the <HI>Mo∣bocracy</HI> replied, that they could not see them there, and defired that they should be placed in a more conspicuous point of View, <Q>otherwise, by G—d <HI>Jack,</HI> there shall be no Play.</Q> Mr. <HI>Wilks</HI> who was not in his Heart of Mo∣bocratical Principles, yet loved his own Interest so well, that he always knew how to be an occasional Conformist, assured them that he had nothing so much at Heart as their Happiness, and accordingly got three Chairs and placed the Kings on the Stage, to the no small Satisfaction of the <HI>Mobocracy,</HI> with whom it is a Maxim to have as much as possible for their Money. From hence it ap∣pears that the Power of the Multitude is perfectly Dicta∣torial; and, indeed, in all Ages the Managers of Play∣houses have acquiesced under the Gallery-Jurisdiction. Mr. <HI>Garrick,</HI> I am credibly informed, notwithstanding the submissive Bows he occasionally makes them, is not entirely reconciled to their Government, and, it is said, is very apt to quote certain treasonable Words from <HI>Horace,</HI> implying that the Vulgar have no claim to In∣sallibility. <HI>Interdum Vulgus Rectum videt, est ubi peccat.</HI> My Intelligence further adds, that he has suppressed many Schemes for adding Novelty to the Amusements of the Public, from a Fear he has conceived of the many-headed Monster of the Gallery; nay, he will at Times carry Matters so far as to pronounce their Beha∣viour illegal, arbitrary, &amp;<HI>c.</HI> and, when they broke all the Windows of his Dwelling-House, so discontented a Spirit possessed him, that he would by no Means ac∣knowledge the Justice of their Proceedings.</P>
<P>Be that as it may; it is certain one dissaffected Per∣son cannot withstand the <HI>Mobocratical</HI> Power, which it
<PB N="273" REF="276"/>is manifest has gained great Strength of late Years, and, I am persuaded, will continue to flourish more and more every Day. They have many wise Maxims by which they govern themselves; such as, "no wooden Shoes", —"Liberty and Property and no Excise"—<Q>no <HI>French</HI> Dancers</Q>—"no Mounseers"—Let every Man toast his own Cheese, &amp;<HI>c.</HI> such prudential Axioms, founded on the soberest Sense, must undoubtedly con∣tribute to render their Administration both wise and prosperous. It does not appear that they have made any great Progress in the modern Art of War; on the contrary, there is Reason to suppose that they all hold it in Contempt; as it is certain that on many Occasions, when our mixed Form of Government has endeavoured to oppose them, by sending the Soldiery against them, they have always laughed at the Military Force, and re∣pelled them from the Assault, without their daring to Fire. Their Military Discipline seems to be derived from the <HI>Romans;</HI> they know no Use of Cannon, Fire-Arms, &amp;<HI>c.</HI> but proceed to Battle with Sticks, Bludgeons, setting up loud Shouts, somewhat like the War-hoop of the <HI>Indians,</HI> and hurling Stones, Brickbats, Bottles, Glasses, &amp;<HI>c.</HI> with tremendous Force on the adverse Party. They are likewise totally Strangers to all Re∣sinements of modern Luxury; Bread and Cheese, and Porter being their chief Sustenance; Gin being only used by them when they are low-spirited, or are going to be hanged. They do not paint their Bodies with Woad, like the ancient <HI>Britons,</HI> but generally with Kennel-Dirt, which lends them a formidable Air in Battle Thus enured to Danger, it will be no wonder if the <HI>Mobocracy</HI> at length becomes Masters of this King∣dom, which, as I conceive it, must shortly be the Case, unless the Vices of People of Fashion should descend to them, and retard them in their Progress. Of this, I must own I am inclined to cherish some Hopes, as I am in∣formed, that, in some Parts of the Town, they drink,
<PB N="274" REF="277"/>and game and swear, and are full as wicked as the better Sort of People. Particularly in <HI>Hockly the Hole,</HI> I am told, that they have a Place called <HI>White</HI>'s Chocolate∣house, that <HI>clean Lodgings for Travellers</HI> are dearer than ever, and that you cannot any where <HI>Shave for a Penny,</HI> the Depravity of the Times having raised the Prices of every Thing there, as well as at the St. <HI>James</HI>'s End of the Town.</P>

And whatever shall be the Decision of the Public on his Genius or Inability, he will stand con∣vinced of their Equity, and will not suffer fond Self-love to lodge an Appeal in his own Breast; he only hopes, that if the Verdict be found against him, it may be, as in the Case of <HI>Elizabeth Canning,</HI> with this qualifying Circumstance; GUILTY of DULLNESS, but not WIL∣FUL and CORRUPT.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG> Ristotle</HI> informs us that <HI>Homer</HI> wrote a Co∣mic-Epic Poem entitled <HI>Margites,</HI> which to the no small Detriment of succeeding Ages, is unfortunately lost. To this Spe∣cies of Poesy, we may suppose Comedy has the same Reference, that the Tragic bears to the Heroic. For my Part, I cannot conceive why a good Comedy has never been stiled by those, who are fond of deciding literary Precedence, the greatest Production of human Nature. Certainly its consisting of known and familiar Ideas, should not derogate from its Merit, because on Account of that very Circumstance, it meets with less Indulgence; the Business of it coming more near to every Man's Breast, and, of Course, the very Vulgar being in some Measure Judges of the Justness of the Imitation; whereas, in Tragedy, frigid Declamation lulls, florid Epithets amuse, lofty Metaphors amaze, and sonorous Expressions elevate and surprize.</P>
<P>As Tragedy aims more particularly at an Excitement of the serious Passions, so the chief Merit of <HI>Comedy</HI> consists in its Effect on the merry Affections of the hu∣man Mind; the former principally awakening Sen∣sations of Terro, and Pity, and the latter giving Emo∣tions of a gay Contempt, as it is elegantly called, or in plainer <HI>English,</HI> making us despise and laugh at an Ob∣ject at the same Time. To succeed in this last men∣tioned Mode of Writing, it requires as fine and as lively
<PB N="277" REF="280"/>an Imagination as any of the other imitative Arts; for as it is manifest, that the Tragic Poet then excites in us the most intense Sensations, when his Expressions con∣vey the liveliest Images to the Fancy, so the Comic Poet, when he seizes the Imagination with a bright Assemblage of ludicrous Ideas, is sure of agitating those Passions, to which his Art directs him, with an irre∣sistible Power. And therefore this Animadversion is sufficient to put an End to that idle Dispute, which, as we learn from <HI>Horace,</HI> engaged the Learned, <HI>viz.</HI> Whether Comedy might be called Poetry or not.
<Q><L><HI>—quidam Comoedia necne Poema</HI></L>
<L><HI>Esset quaesivere—</HI></L></Q> It is manifest that it is an imitative Art, and different Pas∣sions being the Objects of its Address, it only makes use of Means different from the more elevated Species of Writing; but surely it is full as hard a Task to paint or∣dinary Things, as Objects of more Importance; and, in my Opinion, <HI>Virgil</HI>'s Line which describes an old Woman running across <HI>Dido</HI>'s Apartment with officious Zeal,
<Q><HI>Illa gradum studio celerabat anili,</HI></Q> Is as picturesque and has as much Merit as the Descrip∣tion of the ambrosial Locks of <HI>Venus.</HI></P>
<Q><L><HI>Ambrosiaeque comae divinum vertice odorem,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Spiravere.—</HI></L></Q>
<P>The Comic Writer, as well as the Tragedian, must derive his Force from the true primary Sources of Com∣position; that is to say, he must learn to seize our <HI>Ima∣ginations,</HI> with striking Pictures of human Life; he must instruct our Reason by inserting sensible Observa∣tions on worldly Contingencies, and he must also fre∣quently apply himself to those Passions which it is the Merit of his Art to awaken. In this last mentioned
<PB N="278" REF="281"/>Particular consists the real Merit of a well wrought Comedy; in like Manner as the serious Drama must fill us with Ideas proper to excite Terror and Pity. To obtain either Effect, the Poet is to select such Cir∣cumstances in every Object, in every Passion, and in every Action, as will be most conducive to his peculiar End, and he is constantly to avail himself of such Ex∣pressions as will serve to convey the liveliest Images to the Fancy. When this is rightly performed, whether in the solemn or humourous Scene, it is true Poetry, and in either case it is by the Means of a Mode of Elo∣quence, that the Art produces its desired Effect. For Ridicule, by which Comedy works, is as much a Mode of Eloquence, as the several Arts of Persuasion, and the several Figures, which Rhetoric has reduced into a System for the Excitement of the more serious Passions.</P>
<P>The Dispute that subsisted among the Learned for a considerable Time, and is perhaps not yet determined, <HI>viz.</HI> Whether Ridicule is a Test of Truth, is, in my humble Opinion, extremely idle and frivolous; the Fa∣culty of Reason, which compares our Ideas, and fu∣stains or rejects the various Affirmations concerning them, being the sole Judge of Truth, however com∣plicated the Means may be by which it gains its End. I have often wondered, that neither <HI>Aristotle, Tully,</HI> nor <HI>Quintilian,</HI> have given a just and adequate Desinition of Ridicule. To say that it consists in raising our Laugh∣ter at some Turpitude, is a very insufficient Account of the Matter. Mr. <HI>Fulding,</HI> in his Preface to his <HI>Joseph Andrews,</HI> has thrown some Light upon the Matter, but as he places the Source of it in Affectation, he appears to me not to have taken a comprehensive Survey of his Subject. I apprehend the Ridiculous may be formed, where there is no Affectation at the Bottom, and his Parson <HI>Adams</HI> I take to be an Instance of this Assertion.</P>
<P><PB N="279" REF="282"/>The best and most accurate Desinition I have ever met with of the Ridiculous is in a Note of Doctor <HI>Aken∣side</HI>'s to his excellent Poem <HI>on the Pleasures of Imagina∣tion.</HI> <Q>That, says he, which makes Objects ridiculous is some Ground of Admiration or Esteem connected with other more general Circumstances, compara∣tively worthless or deformed; or it is some Circum∣stances of Turpitude or Deformity connected with∣what is in general excellent or beautiful; the incon∣sistent Properties existing either in the Objects them∣selves, or in the Apprehension of the Person to whom they relate, implying Sentiment or Design, and exciting no acute or vehement Emotion of the Heart.</Q> The Effect which the Circumstances thus specified have upon us he thus desines; <Q>the Sensation of Ridicule is not a bare Perception of the Agreement or Disagreement of Ideas, but a Passion or Emotion of the Mind consequential to that Perception.</Q></P>
<P>The Emotions here intended are Laughter and Con∣tempt, and these it is the Business of Comedy to excite, by making striking Exhibitions of inconsistent Circum∣stances, blended together in such a thwarting Assem∣blage, that a gay Contempt irressistibly shall take posses∣sion of us. To perform this in all Objects which come before the Comic Muse, in Men and Manners, in all Actions and Passions, requires a very delicate Hand, and it frequently is necessary to have an almost micro∣scopic Eye to perceive the latent Inconsistency in Cir∣cumstances seemingly fair and praise-worthy. <HI>Prion</HI> has expressed this with his usual Delicacy;
<Q><L><HI>And tho' the Error may be such</HI></L>
<L><HI>As</HI> Knaggs <HI>and</HI> Burgess <HI>cannot hit,</HI></L>
<L><HI>It yet may feel the nicer Touch,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Of</HI> Wycherly <HI>or</HI> Congreve'<HI>s Wit.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>In producing Portraits of Mankind it is not enough to display Foibles and Oddities; a fine Vein of Ridi∣cule must run through the whole, to urge the Mind to
<PB N="280" REF="283"/>frequent Emotions of Laughter; otherwise there will be Danger of exhibiting disagreeable Characters with∣out affording the proper Entertainment I think <HI>Ben Johnson</HI> extremely apt to err in this Point; his <HI>Morose,</HI> is a surly, ill-natured, absurd Humourist, whom we can hardly laugh at, and he soon becomes very bad Company. Many of <HI>Johnson</HI>'s Characters are of the same Cast, while in <HI>Shakespear</HI>'s <HI>Falstaff,</HI> the ridiculous Ideas are placed in such an artful Point of View, that our Merriment can never be restrained, whenever Sir <HI>John</HI> appears. <HI>Congreve</HI> in my Opinion had a great Deal of the same Talent, and what I have somewhere seen objected to him, that many of his Characters are obvious in human Life, is with me a strong Proof of his superior Genius. An Old <HI>Batchelor,</HI> for Instance, is very common, but he must pass through such an Imagination as <HI>Congreve</HI>'s to support several Scenes in the Drama with the most exquisite Pleasantry; tho' the Character was not new, yet his Management of it has all the Graces of Novelty, and the Situations in which we see him are all exquisitely ridiculous. Personages of this Class, unless artfully conducted, may very soon tire an Audience, but in this excellent Poet's Hands nothing suffers a Diminution. The same, I think, ap∣pears in his Sir <HI>Paul Plyant,</HI> in which Character there is perhaps as much Comic Force as in any one Piece on the Stage. Sir <HI>John Vanbrugh</HI> was also a perfect Master of his Art in this Respect, and of this his Sir <HI>John Brute</HI> is a remarkable Proof. The Knight is constantly di∣verting us with an odd whimsical Way of Thinking, which at once serves to display his own Foibles, and en∣tertains his Audience with a Pleasantry of which he seems all along totally unconscious himself.</P>
<P>It is therefore by placing the Humours and Foibles of human Nature in a ridiculous Light, that the true Comic Force is created. The Author of <HI>the Pleasures of Imagination,</HI> whom I have already quoted, has judi∣ciously
<PB N="281" REF="284"/>explained each Part of the Desinition cited above, and has finely traced the several Sources from which true Ridicule springs. Whoever chuses to consider the Matter will find Affectation to be but one Spring, how∣ever diffusive the Streams of it may be. To the Poem itself I beg leave to refer my Readers, and I shall dismiss this Paper, with observing, that the whole Beauty of the Comic Diction consists in the Words and Phrases being so chosen as to give to the Mind the most lively Impression of known and familiar Images, and at the same Time the strongest Marks of Character and each Person's peculiar Temper.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">H</SEG>AVING in my last offered some cursory Remarks upon RIDICULE, I shall in this Day's Paper take Notice of a Species of Writing, which on Account of some Af∣finity between them, is often supposed to be the same with the Ridiculous; and yet, upon an attentive View of the Matter, it appears to be a Mode of Composi∣tion introduced by Men of Genius in order to fall in with that Propensity to Laughter, which prevails with all Mankind in general. What I here intend is <HI>Bur∣lesque;</HI> to mark its Boundaries, its Procedure and Ex∣tent, will be no improper Subject among these Essays, which only pretend now and then to glance so much Light upon Matters of this Nature, as may serve to illu∣strate them to the Unlearned.</P>
<P>It must be remembered, that as the <HI>Ridiculous</HI> consists in a Coalition of Circumstances repugnant to each other in their own Natures, but yet whimsically blended to∣gether in any Object, any human Action or Passion, to call forth this Inconsistency to public View, and to shew the heterogeneous Assemblage, in such a Manner as to provoke the Mind to laugh at it with Contempt, is to exert the rare and excellent talent of <HI>Ridicule,</HI> and as this when well executed is attended with fine conse∣quential Effects, the Lovers of <HI>Burlesque</HI> will not wait to discover a real Incongruity, but by the Force of their own Imaginations they create it for themselves, and by
<PB N="284" REF="287"/>obtruding Circumstances, which perhaps do not belong to the Object, they are frequently very successful in rendering Things apparently ridiculous, which to an attentive Eye may not wear the motly Livery, however it may serve the Purposes of Mirth to invest it with it. In order to explain more fully what is here insisted on, it may not be improper to lay before the Reader a few Instances of the <HI>Ridiculous,</HI> and also of <HI>Burlesque,</HI> which may in some Measure serve to render this Matter still more intelligible and clear.</P>
<P>When <HI>Fielding</HI>'s Parson <HI>Adams</HI> in Distress at an Inn, retires very gravely with a <HI>London</HI> Bookseller to raise Money upon some Manuscript Sermons, I believe the dissonant Circumstances in this Case strike very forcibly, and our Laughter is still urged with greater Impetuo∣sity, when, after having travelled a great many Miles from his own Place of Abode towards <HI>London,</HI> with no other Business upon Earth, but to dispose of these Ser∣mons, we hear the Parson not being able to find them, very gravely say, <Q>I protest I believe I left them be∣hind me.</Q> When the same Personage assures us, that he is very rich, and then adds, that he does not say it by way of boasting or complying with worldly Vanity, but to shew that he can live well on the Road, and, to confirm this, produces half a Guinea, the Dif∣ference between his Opinion and the small Value of the Piece, and this too from a Clergyman, a Scholar, and in many Things a Man of excellent Understanding, produces an Emotion of Laughter attended in this In∣stance with a Contempt for <HI>Adams</HI>'s Want of Know∣ledge of the World. In like manner, when <HI>Don Quixote</HI> very gravely says, that he has seen the Sea, and that it is much larger than the River at <HI>La Mancha,</HI> we can∣not help laughing at a Man who has formed his Ideas of Things by what he has seen at his own native Place, and to find an insignisicant River compared to the Sea,
<PB N="285" REF="288"/>presents such a repugnant Conjunction of Images, as must necessarily operate upon our risible Faculties.</P>
<P>These Instances, which have first, among a Thousand, offered themselves to my Memory, are true Instances of the <HI>Ridiculous,</HI> nothing here being obtruded upon our Imaginations; but in <HI>Burlesque</HI> there are many adventi∣tious Ideas called up, in order to form a motly Concur∣rence of thwarting Images, and so produce the same Effect with the really <HI>Ridiculous.</HI> As for Instance, if any Object which comes before the <HI>Burlesque</HI> Writer, be low in its own Nature, he immediately bethinks him∣self of conferring on it a mock Dignity, in which it begins to look big, like the Champion at a Corona∣tion, who boldly challenges all Mankind when he knows no Body will fight him. I have ever been highly pleased with a Touch of this Kind in a Note to Mr. <HI>Fielding</HI>'s <HI>Tom Thumb,</HI> where mentioning something of the Soul of Man, he gravely tells us, <Q><HI>Plato</HI> is of this Opinion, and so is Mr. <HI>Banks.</HI></Q> The Stroke in the <HI>Beggar</HI>'s <HI>Opera</HI> is of the same Nature —<Q>There is no∣thing so moving as a great Man in Distress.</Q> In this Case the great Disproportion between the two Objects strikes our Imagination, and our Laughter bursts out at that which is, without Foundation, set in Competition. In the following Passage of the Poet, it seems to me, there is a ridiculous Appearance intended by giving a mock Majesty to an Object in the general Opinion not so highly exalted.</P>
<Q><L><HI>Oh! could I view thro'</HI> London <HI>as I pass</HI></L>
<L><HI>Some broad Sir</HI> Balaam <HI>in</HI> Corinthian <HI>Brass!</HI></L>
<L><HI>High on a</HI> Pedestal, <HI>ye Freemen place</HI></L>
<L><HI>His magisterial Paunch and griping Face.</HI></L>
<L><HI>Letter'd and gilt let him</HI> adorn <HI>Cheapside,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And grant the</HI> Tradesman, <HI>what a</HI> King's <HI>deny'd.</HI></L></Q>
<P>Thus the ludicrous Assemblage is formed by an Asso∣ciation of Ideas, which we are diverted to see joined
<PB N="286" REF="289"/>together. The other Method of <HI>Burlesque</HI> is, if an Ob∣ject has any Thing respectable about it, to join it with Images, not only inferior, but in themselves con∣temptible. Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> is very frequent in this Kind of Satyr throughout his <HI>Dunciad,</HI> and <HI>Boileau</HI> is, I think, admirable in both Species of <HI>Burlesque,</HI> in his <HI>Lutrin.</HI> Our own <HI>Garth</HI> also has many beautiful Passages in his <HI>Dispensary,</HI> where a Ridicule is thrown upon his Heroes by associating with them Images of Things, to which some Kind of Turpitude is adherent; thus a Set of <HI>Physicians</HI> quarrelling among themselves are finely placed in a ludicrous Light by the following humourous Simile.</P>
<Q><L><HI>Thus often at the</HI> Temple <HI>Stairs we've seen</HI></L>
<L><HI>Two</HI> Tritons <HI>of a rough athletic Mien,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Sourly dispate some Quarrel of the Flood,</HI></L>
<L><HI>With Knuckles bruis'd, and Face besmear'd with Blood;</HI></L>
<L><HI>But at the first Appearance of a Fare,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Both quit the Fray, and to their Oars repair.</HI></L></Q>
<P>Another very common Method of <HI>Burlesque</HI> is by making frequent Application of grand and sublime Passages in our best Poets to Things unworthy and mean. <HI>Bioleau</HI> is, in my Opinion, the happiest of all modern Poets in this Particular. As Passages of this Nature are frequently mistaken for an Intent to <HI>bur∣lesque</HI> the Author, from whom the Image is borrowed, it may not be improper in this Place to observe, that Parody does not always carry with it any Sneer at the Author parodied. The best Lines in <HI>Virgil</HI> may be aptly applied to other Objects, without his being burlesqued, and we find that <HI>Vida</HI> in his elegant and beautiful Poem on the <HI>Game of Chess,</HI> has al∣most in every Line surprized us with Expressions from the <HI>Aeneid,</HI> by which means he gives Spi∣rit and Life to his Poem, animates his imaginary War∣riours with human Passions, and fills the Fancy with en∣tertaining Ideas of mock heroic Majesty. The De∣scription
<PB N="287" REF="290"/>of the Havock at a Game of Chess is per∣fectly elegant.
<Q><L><HI>Sternitur omne solum buxo atque miserrima caedes</HI></L>
<L><HI>Exoritur; confusa inter sese agmina caedunt,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Implicitaeque ruunt, albae, nigraeque Phalanges;</HI></L>
<L><HI>Sternuntur pedites &amp; corpora quadrupedantum.</HI></L></Q> The Description of the Queen is also highly beautiful.
<Q><L><HI>At medias inter acies crudescit Amazon.</HI></L>
<L><HI>Candida, plena animis, mediisque in millibus ardet.</HI></L></Q> It is plain, that Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> in his Account of a Game at Cards in the <HI>Rape of the Lock,</HI> has imitated this excel∣lent Poet in his Manner of exalting inanimate Things, which can never carry with it any Air of <HI>Burlesque,</HI> be∣cause nothing can be ridiculous, but when a free Agency is applied.</P>
<P>But in <HI>Burlesque,</HI> as in every other Kind of Writing, Truth should be the Foundation, otherwise the Super∣structure must fall, like <HI>Arisiophanes</HI>'s Ridicule of <HI>Socrates,</HI> which is now held in Contempt, as will always be the Case with every Piece of ill-founded Pleasantry; be∣cause the Object thus attacked must be always excep∣tionable, otherwise it can never be essentially hurt by a false Combination of adventitious Ideas. As there is a strong Propensity in the Generality of People to this Kind of Humour, Tragic Poets, in particular, should be cautious how, by any Passage or Expression, they ex∣cite ludicrous Images. If once in the most serious Scene a wrong Association of Ideas be formed, the Mind is apt to attach itself to the Object of its Mirth, and thus a well-imagined Plece may be obstructed. A very elegant Critic observes, that the following Line of <HI>Dryden.</HI>
<Q><HI>A Star light Morning, and an Ev'ning fair.</HI></Q> Has in it nothing improper, and yet, if any one recol∣lects that a <HI>Star-light Morning</HI> is the Language of a
<PB N="288" REF="291"/>Watchman it may occasion some sprightly Raillery. On this account, in all the different species of Compo∣sition the Writer must carefully remember to keep with∣in his proper Boundaries, because the least Excursion too far may be highly prejudicial, and give room to small Wits either to point incongruous Circumstances, or to obtrude them upon the Reader's Imagination.</P>

<P>THE Account which I gave lately of my In∣tentions to abdicate the Office of a public Wri∣ter, has been the Occasion of my receiving several Let∣ters from sundry Correspondents, who have addressed me in a Stile responsive to their respective Feelings on the Occasion. A great many Coffeehouses express their Satisfaction at the Thoughts of being eased of the weekly Expence of Two-pence, which my Lucubrations cost them; a few of these hospitable Gentry declare themselves sorry for my approaching Silence, the <HI>Grays Inn Journal</HI> being, as they assure me, the Life of their Coffee-Room. There are many Persons of such cool and serious Understandings, that they cannot approve any Thing but what is strictly and literally true; these, an ingenious Friend of mine calls, Matter of Fact Men, and by one of this Class I am told in very plain Terms, that he's glad I am going to lay down, <HI>a Pox on your true Intelligence; there's never any thing of Consequence in it; the grand Mogul may be dead; the</HI> Algerines <HI>may make Peace; the King of the</HI> Romans <HI>may be chosen;</HI> Dunkirk <HI>may be refitted;</HI> Theodore <HI>King of</HI> Corsica <HI>be held to Bail, and Mr.</HI> Keen <HI>may succeed in his Negociations without any body's being the wiser for you.</HI> A Person, who in∣sorms me that he is perfectly vers'd in the Secret of Authorship, begs of me to recommend him to my Pub∣lisher,
<PB N="289" REF="292"/>that he may carry on the Paper the ensuing Win∣ter; but in this Point, I must desire to be excused, as I should not chuse to have my Plan eked out beyond its proper Bounds, and I therefore take this Opportunity to entreat that elegant Writer, who has for some Time past assumed the Name of <HI>Ranger,</HI> not to lay any of his Foundlings at my Door, when once I shall have made my Bow to the Public. Such a Procedure would be highly illiberal, and I hope I need not say any thing further on this Head. But to the soft, the obliging, the lovely, the courtly, the amiable <HI>Clarissa,</HI> who calls me, you agreeable Devil, and you pleasant Creature you must go on; what Answer shall I make? The Honour of mak∣ing Part every <HI>Saturday</HI>-morning of a Fair one's Tea-Equipage has certainly very powerful Instigations to per∣sist. But the Truth of it is, my Muse and I have been like Man and Wife for some Time past, our Affections are become extremely frigid, and I have had so many Curtain Lectures from her, that I long very earnestly to keep se∣parate Beds, to say a civil Thing to her once in a Year, and, like a true modern Husband, to admire every Body's <HI>Muse</HI> better than my own, even though she be but a bat∣tered Drab; and though the World should agree, that my <HI>Thalia</HI> is not entirely contemptible. On this Account, I am at present suing in the Court of <HI>Parnassus</HI> for a Di∣vorce, and as she has not brought me any Fortune to speak of, I shall not be troubled to allow her a sepa∣rate Maintenance. I am aware that malicious Critics will give out, that I was separated <HI>causâ frigiditatis;</HI> but, the Public is always equitable in its Decisions, and to them I implicitly submit.</P>

<BIBL><HI>VIRG.</HI></BIBL></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T is a general Complaint made by my fair Countrywomen, that the Gentlemen, re∣gardless of that Respect and Attention which are at all Times due to their Charms, shew a great Averseness to their Company. I fear this Charge cannot be controverted, and am sorry to see the Truth manisested in the constrained Deportment, in ele∣gant Address, and uncouth Attempts at Politeness, that almost universally characterize the Youth of this Island.</P>
<P>Certain it is, that a frequent, liberal Intercourse with that more refined Part of our Species, which is happily described by the Appellation of the <HI>Beau Sex,</HI> so power∣fully influences, not only our Manner and Behaviour, but our Way of thinking, that from thence we acquire a certain Delicacy of Sentiment, which extends itself even to the most minute Circumstances of Life. And from hence it is, that our Neighbours, the <HI>French,</HI> have established throughout <HI>Europe</HI> that Character of Polite∣ness, which we do not chuse to be at the Trouble of emulating, as we find it much more easy to ridicule and laugh at it. My Lord <HI>Anglois,</HI> while the Profusion, with which he disperses his Guineas, creates Astonishment in the Mechanics of <HI>Paris,</HI> conscious of a Desiciency in that Ease and elegant Freedom, which he observes in every Man of Education whom he meets, shuns all good Company; and after reluctantly spending three Months between the <HI>Hôtel</HI> and the several Places of public Diversion, returns to his native Soil, strongly im∣pressed
<PB N="291" REF="294"/>with the most contemptuous Idea of the <HI>French,</HI> whom, though he has but literally seen, he takes the Liberty to describe as a superficial, volatile Nation, for no other Reason perhaps, than that they are perfectly skilled in the most entertaining, I had almost said, useful Art, that Invention can suggest, which is, to trisle agreeably.</P>
<P>A <HI>Frenchman</HI> has no more Idea of a Party of Pleasure, without Ladies, than an <HI>Englishman</HI> can entertain the least Conception of enjoying himself, until they retreat. From those opposite Dispositions it arises, that the first introduces himself with a becoming Unconcern into Company, and Master of that <HI>Bienseance,</HI> which distin∣guishes the Gentleman, and performs all Offices of Life, without the least Embarassment: Whereas nothing is more common among us, than to find Gentlemen of Fa∣mily and Fortune, who know nothing of the Fair-Sex, but what they have collected from the most abandoned Part of it, and can scarce reckon a virtuous Family, within the whole Scope of their Acquaintance. It is not unpleasant to observe one of this Class, when Chance or Necessity has brought him into a Room with Ladies of Reputation. An aukward Restraint hangs a∣bout him, and he is almost afraid to speak, least he should inadvertently bolt out something, which, tho' extremely suitable to the Dialect of <HI>Covent-Garden,</HI> would be grosly offensive to those Females, who had not received their Rudiments of Education in that Seminary. The Gloom that hangs over an <HI>English</HI> Company, while the Ladies remain, and the reciprocal Restraint, that each Sex seems to be upon the other, has been fre∣quently a Subject of ludicrous Observations to Foreign∣ers; and indeed, the Fair-ones themselves, <HI>tho' Natives, and to the Manner born,</HI> frequently express Astonishment, what Mysteries the Men can have to celebrate, so oppo∣site to those of the <HI>Bona Dea,</HI> that no Female must be present at the Ceremony. I am not at Liberty to di∣vulge
<PB N="292" REF="295"/>this important Secret, but will, for the Satisfaction of the Ladies, assure them, that they are not of a Nature vastly beyond their Apprehension; nay, on the contrary, may be casily understood, even by a Miss in Hanging-Sleeves, provided she has had the Happiness of a Board∣ing-School Education.</P>
<P>At the same Time, that I condemn my Countrymen for separating themselves from those, who have the Art of refining every Joy this World affords, I am sorry to be obliged to observe, that the Ladies themselves do, in some Measure, contribute to this great Evil. The scan∣dalcus Practice, so prevalent at present, of giving up their whole Thoughts, as well as Time, to Cards, has made the Company of Women, pardon the Expression, extremely insipid to those, who would willingly consider them as rational Creatures, and do not depend upon su∣perior Skill in the Game of Whist for a Subsistance. Is it to be imagined, that a Man, whose Mind is the least raised above the Vulgar, will devote that Time, which he may employ in conversing agreeably either with the Dead or the Living, to those Assemblies, where no Ideas enter beyond the respective Excellencies of <HI>Garrick</HI> and <HI>Barry,</HI> and the several possible Cases, so profoundly calculated by the incomparable Mr. <HI>Hoyle?</HI> Yet from declining these Places, I know many intimate Friends, who have acquired the odious Character of Women-haters, tho' at the same Time, they entertain the highest Esteem for that amiable Sex, and sincerely regret, that the Tyrant Fashion has put it out of their Power to enjoy more of their Company, than a bare View of their Persons, agitated by the various and un∣certain Revolutions of Fortune's Wheel.</P>
<P>Besides what I have already mentioned, another Ob∣stacle, extremely pernicious to Society, proceeds from the excessive Officiousness of the female World in cut∣ing out Matches. Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> has observed, that <HI>every Women is at Heart a Rake,</HI> and I believe it is not less
<PB N="293" REF="296"/>true, though I fear the Assertion will be much more offensive to the Virgins of <HI>Britain,</HI> that <HI>every Woman is a Fortune-hunter.</HI> This Character is deservedly infamous in the male Part of the Creation, and we detest the Man, <HI>though of an exceeding good Family in</HI> Ireland, who, aided by the Friendship and Confidence of his Taylor, makes a pompous Display of the Breadth of his Shoul∣ders, and the Firmness of his Calves; but conceive no Indignation against the lovely Nymph, who <HI>undresses</HI> herself, in the same View, with the most seducing Art, and generously, much too generously, for her own In∣terest! exhibits every Charm the happy Man will be possessed of, who takes her to his Posom. The Idea of entrapping somebody mixes so intimately with the ge∣neral Cast of Thought in Women, that they can never divest themselves of it, and if a Gentleman pays that Compliment to their Beauty, which female Pride would never Pardon, if he had omitted, they immediately flatter themselves, that he must have a Design of Mar∣riage. This Notion once conceived, a Convocation of Aunts, old Maids, discreet Friends, prudent Neigh∣bours, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is assembled, when every Circumstance must be discussed.—Miss intimates—<Q>He is very par∣ticular to me—what can he mean?—He looked at me all the Time he was here—Sure he'll propose soon—Then did you remark, Aunt <HI>Betty,</HI> when we talked of Marriage, what he said?—He certainly means to have me</Q>—The Result of this Consulta∣tion is, that Miss must carry it with a proper Reserve, in order to compel the imaginary Lover to declare him∣self, who, if he be a Man of Experience in the Subtleties of Women, instantly sees through the flimsy Artifice, and discontinues his Visits. I submit to the Candor of every female Reader, whether I have here drawn an ideal Picture.—Can these angelic Beings reasonably expect then, that a Man will chuse to visit them, under the disagreeable alternative of behaving continually
<PB N="294" REF="297"/>with a ceremonious Distance, or running the Risk of being driven to the Necessity of an aukward Explana∣tion?—No; while narrow Sentiments of this Kind prevail, it will be impossible to introduce a truly social Converse between the Sexes, which must be effected, on the Part of the Ladies, by an undesigning decent Freedom, the inseparable Companion of real Virtue. —Let them assert their own Dignity, and manifest a Consciousness, that they were not created merely to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> umental in the Continuation of the Species, but are endowed with intellectual Faculties, that qualify them for the sweet Joys of Society. Let them at length so far undeceive themselves, as to think, that a Man may like their Company, admire their Virtues, nay, even their personal Charms, and cherish the warmest Friend∣ship for them, without any Intention of addressing them on the Score of Love; let them but offer this Vio∣lence to the natural Vanity of their Sex, and I will undertake to promise, that they will not long have Reason to complain of being neglected.—Men of S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>se will then seek their Company, and, what I hope may make some Impression on a semale Mind, will then think of them as Partners for Life.</P>

<HEAD>Extract of a Letter, dated Crown Coffee-house, Bedford-Row, Aug. <HI>26.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Gentlemen here are greatly concerned at the Thoughts of losing you, both on Account of the Pleasure they will be deprived of by the Discontinuance of your Paper, and of the perpetual Impertinence they will be subject to from Mr. <HI>Shortcough,</HI> who, since you first gave him a Touch of your Pen, has been restrained, by his Fears of another Lashing, within some Sort of Bounds; but since you have declared your Intentions of relinquishing your Paper, he has transgressed all De∣cency,
<PB N="295" REF="298"/>and is every Instant committing Cutrages against Good-breeding and Manners. Since you first mentioned him, he has never troubled us at making a Bet when the Odds are in his Favour, with saying, <Q>Come, I've a Guinea in my Pocket, which my Wife knows no∣thing of.</Q>—But he is now returned to his Vomit: <HI>Pride</HI> and <HI>Meanness</HI> are surprizingly blended in him, and these two opposite Qualities disclose themselves daily by a vain Ambition of being thought rich, and a Poverty of Spirit in doing the lowest Actions. Though a Pack of Cards will not at any Ale-house fetch more than a Groat, Mr. <HI>Shortcough</HI> will slily slip one into his Pocket. He incessantly offers Bets, but never makes any unless he meets with a <HI>Pigeon,</HI> that gives him the Advantage of Four-pence in the Shilling. It is common, by way of shewing him off, to give him a Shilling to lay Half a Guinea, and chuse his Side; and when he has <HI>five Love,</HI> he has made an even Bet with a Gentleman, who offered it to him in Derision. In his Conversation he is elegant beyond Description, and his Phrases are greatly above any Passage in <HI>Swift</HI>'s polite Conversation. <Q>You Son of a B—h;—you Dog;—you Rascal;— you hubble bubble-pated Puppy;—hang yourself, and drown your Bastards;—Oh! my God, quoth <HI>Nanny Sayer,</HI> what a Whore am I!—Fatal FOUR, all the World O'ER;—you, Mr. <HI>Quibus,</HI> you may kiss my—Nominativo; Quibus, Quobus, Quod∣bus; and so forth.</Q> With this Sort of Literature does he infest the Company the whole Evening, and it is ushered in with a stentorial Voice enough to crack the Ceiling.—His Age protects him from the Correction of the Arm, but surely cannot exempt him from the coercive Power of a Satyrist. Pray, Mr. <HI>Ranger,</HI> pick such a Rod out of this Bundle as may hercaster be hung up here <HI>in terrorem,</HI> and you'll oblige, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

<HI>William Purl,—Walter Wormwood,—Abraham Scurvygrass,—Robert Mum</HI> alias <HI>Threethreads,— Oliver Tatoo,—Alexander M'Gregor,</HI> and <HI>John Boba∣dil</HI> were Indicted, for that they, without having the Love of Truth before their Eyes, but urged on by the Instigations of their Malice and Appetite, have pre∣sumed to pass their Decision, in a Pamphlet entitled the <HI>Monthly Review,</HI> upon all Performances in Literature, ever studious to recommend their own native Dullness, or indeed, the Dullness of any other Person, provided he or his Bookseller condescend to make Interest with them, decrying at the same Time all Works that have the least Ray of Genius, according as they happen to dislike the Author's Face, or that of the Bookseller who may have purchased the Copy, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Being all severally asked, they pleaded <HI>Not Guilty;</HI> then the <HI>Attorney General</HI> of the Court opened the Pro∣secution with the following Speech.</P>
<Q><P><HI>Gentlemen of the Jury,</HI></P>
<P>The several Misdemeanors of the Psendo-Critics, who now stand at the Bar of this honourable Court, are of as glaring a Die as ever came under the Cognizance of a Seat of Judicature, intended to be supplemental to the Laws of the Land. It is observed by Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI>
<Q><L><HI>— Less dangerous is th'Offence</HI></L>
<L><HI>To tire our Patience, than mislead our Sense.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>Now I appeal to the impartial Opinion of every Rea∣der, who has thought it worth his while to turn over the Leaves of the <HI>Monthly Review,</HI> whether more malicious, false, and ill-grounded Criticisms were ever sent Abroad into the World, since the Days of <HI>Zoilus,</HI> down to the present <HI>Aera</HI> of these notable Reviewers? I am per∣suaded, Gentlemen of the Jury, that a more gross Im∣position was never offer'd to the Republick of Letters, than for a Bookseller, whose Sign is justly <HI>emblematical</HI> of his Authors, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Dunciad,</HI> to take upon him to dictate to the Public in a Work, conducted by obscure
<PB N="298" REF="301"/>Hirelings, Country Schoolmasters, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Certain it is that a critical Performance, under the Direction of Gen∣tlemen, and Scholars, written with Taste, Impartiality, and Erudition might be highly serviceable to the Cause of Literature. A Man, for Instance, who should give such an Account of Works of Taste, as <HI>Pere Brumoy</HI> has of the <HI>Greek</HI> Dramatic Poets, would deserve to be cherished by the Public, and the Bookseller, who should publish such a Performance would acquire Honour and Reputation in his Business. But as Matters have been managed by the <HI>Reviewers,</HI> it is manifest that the whole is a mere Job, eternally swelled out with dull Extracts from dull Authors, calculated to serve the Purposes of a few Publishers, and to misguide the Public Taste. The frequent Abuses of the Liturgy, the Arguments for abo∣lishing the <HI>Athanasian</HI> Creed, and the scandalous Treat∣ment of many Clergymen of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> are strong Indications of the Hand of a Fanatic; and the idle Strictures of natural History, Fossils, Minerals, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are infallible Marks of a certain exploded Herbalist, who has reduced himself to the lamentable Situation de∣scribed by a great Genius, when he says there is not a more miserable Figure than a Man who has wrote himself down. It is therefore submitted to the common Sense of Mankind, whether it is not the highest Presumption in a Set of Hirelings to impose on the Judgment of their unfortunate Readers by a gross Misrepresentation of all Compositions, according as they are directed by a Spirit of Malevolence or Partiality; to usurp the Seat of Cri∣ticism without declaring who and what they are, without producing their Credentials, to shew the World by what Authority they act, and without previously giving un∣deniable Proofs of their own Ability and Taste, according to the Statute of Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI>
<Q><L><HI>Let such teach others, who themselves excel,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And censure freely, who have written well.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="299" REF="302"/>That not one of the Authors of the <HI>Review</HI> have <HI>writ∣ten well,</HI> will appear in their Works, if they are any where to be found. I shall now proceed to examine the Witnesses, and make no doubt but the Gentlemen of the Jury will find a Verdict against the Writers of Calumny and Detraction.</P></Q>

<P>Here the Prosecution rested; the Counsel for the Prisoners produced a Commission from <HI>Grub-street,</HI> but it was over ruled by the Court, who told them, that no <HI>Grub-street</HI> Commission could authorize a Re∣bellion against Candor, Taste, and Truth. They then offered an Extract of a Letter from <HI>Oxford,</HI> but, upon strict Enquiry, the said Letter was found to be a Forgery, no Individual of that Learned Body being capable of holding an Intercourse with obscure, hackney Scribblers, who deal out Malice and Invective by the Sheet. Whereupon the Council against the Prosecu∣tion, declared, they had nothing further to offer in Fa∣vour of their Clients, and the Judge proceeded to give his Charge to the Jury, declaring the <HI>Monthly Review</HI> to be an Insult on the Understandings of all the good Peo∣ple of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> calculated to serve the Purposes of Booksellers, and gratify the Resentment of <HI>bad Au∣thors,</HI> who, as Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> observes, are generally <HI>bad Men.</HI></P>
<P>He declared the arbitrary Proceeding of the Pri∣soners at the Bar to be very like the Declaration of a Personage in <HI>Moliere</HI>'s Play, called <HI>Les Femmes Scavantes,</HI> who says, very pleasantly, <Q>By our own Laws we will be the sole Judges of Composition; by our Laws every Thing in Prose and Verse shall be sub∣mitted to us; no one shall be allowed Wit, except ourselves and our Friends; we will make it our Business to find fault and detract, till at length we shall find ourselves the only People capable of fine Writing.</Q>

<L><HI>Et ne verrons que nous qui sachent bien ecrire.</HI></L></Q> And it was therefore recommended to the Jury to bring in a Verdict for the Prosecution, which they accordingly did, without withdrawing from the Court. In Conse∣quence of which, Sentence was pronounced as follows.</P>
<P>You <HI>William Purl,—Walter Wormwood,— Abraham Scurvygrass,—Robert Mum</HI> alias <HI>Threethreads, —Oliver Tattoo,—Alexander M'Gregor,</HI> and <HI>John Bobadil,</HI> are to go back to the Goal from whence ye came; there you are to be locked up from the use of Pen, Ink, and Paper, for the Space of three Years, during which Time, you are to be placed in the Pil∣lory on the first Day of every Month (unless it should fall on a <HI>Sunday</HI>) for the Space of two Hours; after which you are to be whipped through <HI>Grub-street,</HI> and so the Lord have Mercy on your Souls!</P>
<P><HI>Purl, Wormwood,</HI> and <HI>M'Gregor</HI> petitioned to be hanged, in Imitation of one <HI>Tutchin</HI> celebrated in the <HI>Dunciad,</HI> but they were told, that like him they should be <HI>siagrant from the Scourge below; Bobadil,</HI> pleaded his <HI>Belly,</HI> but it being upon Record that he had used the same Plea once before, it was rejected; where∣upon he seemed to be hardened in Malevolence, and declared he would, as soon as an Opportunity offered, write a CRITICAL REVIEW

</EPIGRAPH>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HERE is not a more favourite, or a more trite Subject, of Declamation, than the Degeneracy of the Times. Each Indivi∣dual of Society, charitably judging himself excepted from the general Reproach, assumes a Privi∣lege to inveigh against the Vices of the Age, and the total Decline from those Virtues, which immortalized the exalted Characters of Antiquity, and enabled the Ancestors of the present Race of <HI>Englishmen,</HI> to deliver down to Posterity a Constitution, which still renders them the Envy of the World.</P>
<P>This splenetic Humour of decrying the Moderns, is become so universal, that all Ranks and Orders of Men, seem more or less infected by it. The Divine patheti∣cally bewails the shameful Neglect of Religion. The Patriot laments, that Venality and Corruption have irretrievably extinguished the genuine Spirit of Liberty. The Philosopher sighs, that Enthusiasm and Supersti∣tion should have usurped the Throne of free Enquiry, and debased the intellectual Faculties The Fair com∣plain, that the dissolute Inclinations of the Men compel them to drag out an uncomfortable Life in Celibacy; while the Men, in their Turn, pour out the most bitter Invectives against the Extravagance and Dissipation of the other Sex, which, they would have the World be∣lieve, are risen to such an Excess, that the Word Ma∣trimony
<PB N="304" REF="307"/>carries with it the Idea of Bankruptcy and Ruin. Nay so far has the Influence of this Infatuation reached, that it is become very common for even Stock∣jobbers to assert, <Q>that Things are not now, as they have been—nothing is to be done now—the Prokerage in and out runs away with all the Profit; whereas, in King <HI>William</HI>'s Time, when the Govern∣ment was distressed for Money, and necessitated to give six <HI>per Cent.</HI> upon a Loan, great Strokes were to be made.</Q></P>
<P>In order, therefore, to shew the Unreasonableness, as well as Disingenuity, of this epidemic Dissatisfaction with the Age, in which I had the Happiness to be born, I shall endeavour to demonstrate, and, I flatter myself, I shall be able to do it, beyond all Possibility of Doubt, that the now exining Inhabitants of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> so far from being inferior to their illustrious Predecessors, do at this Day surpass the Ancients in all the admired Virtues and Qualifications, which the most enthusiastic Idolizer of Antiquity shall be able to point out.</P>
<P>In the first Place, <HI>Socrates, Plato, Cicero,</HI> and some few others of remote Antiquity, are frequently cele∣brated for that amazing Strength of Mind, which enabled them to detect the Impostures of the Religion, established in the Country where they were born, and empowered them to break through the Impediments, which Superstition and Priestcrast had placed in the Avenues to Truth. But surely the insignificant Number of Instances, that ancient History furnishes, of those truly-philosophic Characters, however, respectable the Names may be, will little deserve our Attention, when we consider how infinitely the present Age eclipses their Claim of Superiority, in this Respect. Is there a Gentleman at this Day, any Way conversant in polite Life, who does not entertain the greatest Contempt for the Prejudices, or Faith (as it is vulgarly called.) in which he was educated? Are not the Coffee-houses
<PB N="305" REF="308"/>about <HI>Temple-Bar,</HI> nay, even in the City, so many Seminaries, where our Youth discuss the most important Questions of Philosophy, and explode the Errors im∣posed on Mankind for so many Centuries? Nor is this Knowledge, as among the Ancients, the Result of te∣dious Enquiry and Meditation, but entirely intuitive, being most eminent in those, who are almost totally void of the least Acquisition in any Branch of Litera∣ture, and indebted to Nature alone for their astonishing Discoveries.</P>
<P>The Advocate for Antiquity will, perhaps, thunder out an Eulogium on the exalted Virtue and Patriotism of <HI>Cato, Brutus,</HI> and several other illustrious <HI>Romans,</HI> who, prodigal of Life, disdained to survive the Liber∣ties of their Country. But certainly there can be no room to run a Parallel, the Advantage is so obviously on the Side of the Moderns. Those ingenious Histo∣rians, the Daily News-Writers, in every Page of their Works afford us Examples of the noblest Disregard of Death. The <HI>Roman</HI> voluntarily quits the World, be∣cause he could not bear to be a Witness of the Slavery of his Country; but, the <HI>Englishman</HI> puts a Period to his Existence, because the Fogs of <HI>November</HI> depress his Spirits, and he scorns to be compelled to live longer, than Life continues agreeable. How noble is this Spirit of Freedom! which is not confined to People of Birth and Education, but extends itself to the lowest Mechanics, insomuch, that my Lord is not more ready to discharge a Pistol through his Brain, than his Barber. In short, the Point is so extremely clear, that it would be quite superfluous to labour at the Proof of it, and I may venture to assert, that no Nation, of which Hi∣story has preserved the least Record, has any Preten∣sion, to dispute the Glory of Suicide with <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>I am aware, that great Stress may be laid upon the literary Merit of the Ancients, and expect to hear the Names of <HI>Aristotle, Longinus</HI> and <HI>Quintilian</HI> thrown
<PB N="306" REF="309"/>out, with an exulting Air of Triumph. Far be it from me, to attempt to derogate from the long established Fame of those great Men. Undoubtedly, they were very good Critics for the Times, in which they lived; but with all due Respect to those celebrated Geniusses, we may take the Liberty to suppose, that the Art of Criticism must be now much better understood, than it possibly could be in their Days, as it is much more uni∣versally studied. Attorneys Clerks, Mercers 'Appren∣tices, and Merchants Book-keepers in this Year 1754, <HI>credite posteri</HI> are thoroughly qualified to pronounce, in the most decisive Manner, upon the Merit of all literary Compositions, particularly dramatic Poetry, the noblest Province of polite Learning; not to mention, that we have found out the Absurdity, and shook off the re∣straint, of those Fetters, which the Stagyrite would rivet on us, and transferred them to our Gallic Neigh∣bours, a Nation inured to, and patient of, Slavery.</P>
<P>Should any discontented, or disappointed Politician, after poring over <HI>Livy,</HI> insinuate, that Mankind are not now, as they were in the Times of the <HI>Roman</HI> Re∣public, when private Considerations always gave Way to the publick Good, I would only desire such a phleg∣matic Murmurer to look through the Kingdom, and ob∣serve what a Number of Gentlemen have impaired their Estates, and destroyed the Tranquillity and Happiness of their Families, in order to procure a Seat in the Re∣presentative-Assembly of the Nation: undoubtedly with no other View, but that they might be watchful over the Liberties of their Country.</P>
<P>Some mercantile Cynic, dissatisfied with an unruly Son, who finds more Charms within the Regions of <HI>Covent-Garden,</HI> than the Counting-House, will perhaps pay little Regard to what I have hitherto advanced, and exclaim, <Q>that the Spirit of Industry is quite lost, and People of this Age regard nothing but Pleasure.</Q>— But the Injudice of this Censure would evidently appear
<PB N="307" REF="310"/>to this narrow-minded Citizen, if, the next Time he went to the Pit at <HI>Drury-Lane</HI> with his Wife and Daugh∣ters on a <HI>Saturday,</HI> he would take the Trouble to make Enquiry, concerning the most gay and brilliant Per∣sonages in the Boxes. He could then be informed, that they are Gentlemen, by Way of Eminence, distin∣guished by the Appellation of <HI>Knights of Industry,</HI> who, without any visible Means of Subsistence, enjoy all the Pleasures of this Metropolis, in the most elegant Man∣ner, and run into Expences, which few Men of <HI>real</HI> Fortune can support.</P>
<P>Let us now turn our View to the amiable Sex, and enter into a Comparison between the Females of an∣cient Times and the present Ladies of <HI>Great Britain.</HI> In what an honourable Light will our Country-Women appear? In vain shall the Pedant, who derives his Knowledge solely from Books, harangue upon the con∣jugal Attachment of <HI>Roman</HI> Matrons, while we can mention numberless <HI>British</HI> Wives, who, at this Day, with unexampled Unanimity, go Hand in Hand with their Husbands, in pursuit of the grand Business of Life; mean GAMING; which Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> in his usual emphatic Manner, calls <HI>the Nation's last great Trade.</HI> Nor should the Candor and Disinterestedness of the Vir∣gins of this Island want that Encomium, which Justice cannot refuse. <HI>Plutarch</HI> insorms us, that <HI>Lycurgus</HI> or∣dered the <HI>Spartan</HI> Nymphs to appear at the public Exercises, in Garments, made with artificial Openings, in different Parts, in order that the <HI>Lacedaemonian</HI> Youth might be captivated, by a seemingly accidental Disco∣very of their Charms. But our Fair ones, disdaining so disingenuous a Proceeding, and scorning to take Advantage of the Illusion of Imagination, which, in∣flamed by a transient Glympse, is apt to form enthu∣siastic Ideas of hidden Beauty, <HI>shew Things as they really are,</HI> and by making a generous Display of all their Charms, leave no room to their future Husbands, to
<PB N="308" REF="311"/>complain, that they were deceived in their Expecta∣tions.</P>
<P>These Examples, which I have brought in support of the Proposition, I undertook to prove, will sufficiently evince to every impartial Mind, that the pretended Pre∣eminence of <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Rome</HI> over <HI>Britain,</HI> has no other Foundation, than Prepossession and Envy; and all un∣prejudiced Readers must acquiesce in the Truth of the Observation, made, with great Insight into human Na∣ture, by the elegant Historian, from whom I have taken the Motto of this Paper—<HI>We are naturally more ready to do Justice to what we hear of than to what we see; cotemporary Merit excites our Envy, but that of an∣cient Times our Veneration: We do not think curselves eclipsed by the latter, but consider the former as a re∣proachful <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ession to us.</HI></P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> Cannot but very much approve that Spirit of Patriotism, which seems to have inspired the Essay of last <HI>Saturday.</HI> The Generality of Mankind are slavishly attached to esta∣blished Prejudices, and it must be a strong and manly Genius, that will dare to examine received Opinions, and boldly assert the Truth against popular Sentiments and vulgar Error. This, Mr. <HI>Ranger,</HI> you have per∣formed very eminently in your last Paper; and as I en∣tirely coincide with your Way of thinking, I beg Leave to address this Letter to you, as a Supplement to what you have there advanced.</P>
<P>I must avow that I entirely agree with you, that the Moderns have in every thing greatly exceeded the ad∣mired Ancients. If the latter boast their <HI>Plato,</HI> we have our Lord <HI>Shaftsbury;</HI> and if the Death of <HI>Cato</HI> is justly stiled by the Poet, <HI>Catonis nobile Letum,</HI> because he would not survive the Loss of Liberty, is it not much more heroic in a modern Cobler to dispatch himself, for on other Reason but that he does not like the Weather, or in a Nobleman to cut his Throat, because he has lost the odd Trick at Whist? In addition to this, it must be con∣sidered that few Instances of this Sort of Fortitude are ecorded among the <HI>Romans;</HI> whereas I am credibly in∣formed
<PB N="311" REF="314"/>by a very sensible Man, and one of the <HI>Coroner</HI>'s <HI>Inquest,</HI> that there does not pass by a single Day, without his being called to Turvey the glorious Reliques of a self-devoted Taylor, Shoemaker, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The same Person assures me at the same Time, that not a tenth Part of those exalted Minds have the due Honours paid to their Memory by the public News papers, but are permitted to remove themselves from human Life in the same Si∣lence, as if they had quietly pass'd through Nature to Eternity, and never dared to fly in the Face of their Maker. But to set this Matter in the clearest Point of View, I shall here draw up a Catalogue of whatever may seem to give the Ancients a Claim to our Preference, contrasted with a List of modern Improvements, upon a fair Inspection of which, I flatter myself, the Laurel, will by every impartial Reader be adjudged to the present Age.</P>

Without adding any supernumerary Articles, I think, it is marifest from the above State of the Case, that the Moderns can easily balance the Scale with the so much celebrated Ancients. But the Matter does not rest here, Mr. <HI>Ranger;</HI> I am convinced we can throw in several Circumstances which will greatly entitle us to the Pre-eminence. As for instance, I do not find that they had an <HI>Atheist</HI> among them; and surely the Character of an <HI>Atheist</HI> must in the Eyes of all Men of Sense, do very great Honour to the present Age, the Tenets of his Phi∣losophy being entirely new, and such as were not disco∣ver'd by <HI>Plato, Tully, Socrates,</HI> or any of the ancient Philo∣sophers: That happy Discovery being reserved for the pre∣sent Age, so much enlightened, as a great Genius says, in all true Philosophy. Add to this, what has been al∣ready urged on a similar Occasion, the Ancients were totally ignorant of the Laws of <HI>England,</HI> and, I believe, it cannot be denied, but the common Law of <HI>England</HI> is by many Degrees preferable to the Laws of <HI>Solon,</HI> or any other Legislator, as it is founded upon the sure Basis of common Sense, intelligible to the meanest Capacity, without much Study, and full as easy in the Practice as in the Theory. I must acknowledge that I have read in <HI>Livy</HI> and <HI>Sallust</HI> some random Accounts of the Contempt the Candidates had in <HI>Rome</HI> for Money upon all Elections for the Consulship, the Tribuneship, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> this Proce∣dure among them was stiled by the ill-natured by the Name of <HI>Ambitus,</HI> and by the rigid among the Moderns Bribery and Corruption; but, to divest Things of odi∣ous Appellations, the public and benevolent Spirit of our Countrymen at a general Election cannot be parallelled any where in the <HI>Roman</HI> Page. The Ancients occasi∣onally
<PB N="313" REF="316"/>make a Murmur concerning a Matter which they call <HI>nequissima faenora,</HI> but it will need no Force of Argu∣ment to prove, that Usury has attained to a greater De∣gree of Profusion among the Moderns. How many young Heirs are ruined with us before they come to Years of Discretion? Not to mention that they had not the faintest Idea of the <HI>Stocks, Jonathan</HI>'s Coffee-House, <HI>Change Alley,</HI> the <HI>South-Sea-House,</HI> the <HI>India-House, Res∣counters, Directors, Brokers, &amp;c.</HI> That the <HI>Romans</HI> were a very exponsive People, is very well known to Mr. <HI>Ran∣ger,</HI> and every one who has dipped into <HI>Vertot</HI>'s Revolu∣tions, or the famous <HI>Montesquieu</HI>'s Causes of the Declen∣sion of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire; notwithstanding this, I have the Pleasure to congratulate my Countrymen on our owing so many Millions of Money; and I persuade my∣self, every one of my Readers will allow, that the na∣tional Debt gives us a very great Advantage over the Ancients. I am not ignorant that <HI>Sallust</HI> mentions <HI>pub∣licè Egestatem, privatim Opulentiam, public Penury</HI> and <HI>private Opulence.</HI> But, Sir, I appeal to you whether we have not both these more glaringly than appears any where in the <HI>Roman</HI> History. Tho' I should be sorry to be guided by a national Partiality in this Matter, yet I cannot but think our <HI>national Debt</HI> is as remarkable a Thing as I ever read of in History; and as to private Wealth the infinite Sums of Money laid out in arti∣ficial Falls of Water, artificial Canals, and indeed in artificial Wine, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> most evidently evince our Superio∣rity. Moreover, I apprehend, the Ancients were en∣tire Strangers to Routs and Drums; not to mention two or three Hundred Card-Tables in one House. I do not think that they seem to have the faintest Idea of an E. O. Table, of <HI>reversing,</HI> of <HI>forcing,</HI> of <HI>finessing,</HI> of <HI>seesawing,</HI> and the many elegant Turns in the Game of Whist. <HI>Picquet, Brag, Backgammon, Cribbidge,</HI> are not even mentioned in the slightest manner, and, I flatter my∣self I may say, without the Danger of a Controversy, that
<PB N="314" REF="317"/>the Discoveries made by Mr. <HI>Hoyle</HI> in the Doctrine of <HI>Chances,</HI> by far exceed their deepest Researches in the Mathematicks.</P>
<P>To give the Argument another turn; the Beauty, the Elegance and Manners of our <HI>British</HI> Ladies give a sur∣prizing Lustre to the present Age. <HI>Horace</HI> informs us,
<Q><L><HI>Matronae praeter faciem nil cernere possis,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Caetera, ni Catia est, demissâ veste tegentis.</HI></L></Q> A Matron never shews any Part of her Person except her Face, they being all studious, unless it be <HI>Catia,</HI> to cover the rest of their amiable bodies with a Garment. <HI>Catia</HI> it seems then is a singular Instance; but how different is the Conduct of the Matrons of the modern Times? They have all happily emerged from the Ruff of Queen <HI>Bess,</HI> and their chief Endeavour is to display all their Charms to full View. Had this Fashion prevailed a∣mong the ancient Ladies, I conceive, a <HI>naked Venus</HI> would not have been so great a Rarity. Indeed in <HI>Eng∣land</HI> some Remains of this false Modesty prevailed not very long since, in consequence of which Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> has finely said,
<Q><L><HI>If</HI> Queensbury <HI>to strip there's no compelling,</HI></L>
<L><HI>'Tis from a Handmaid we must take an</HI> Helen.</L></Q> But happily future Painters will not be reduced to such Difficulties, as the modern Ladies are daily stripping as fast as they can, and the visible Approaches of the amia∣ble Sex to a general Nakedness cannot fail to give a Lustre to my fair Countrywomen beyond all <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Roman</HI> Fame. The Tendency to undressing is so strong at present, that I make no doubt but the Time will come in a Period not far distant, when Miss in her Teens will cry out, <Q>Lard, Mamma, I have been reading the <HI>World</HI> or the <HI>Gray's-Inn Journal,</HI> but they are so full of hard cramp Words, I can't think what to make of 'em—Pray, Mamma, what can they mean by Stays?</Q> <Q>—Really Child, says Mamma, I can't say for certain,
<PB N="315" REF="318"/>but if one may conjecture, I should imagine, that in those Days the Women wore something about their Bo∣dies as high from the Waist up as the Pit of their Sto∣mach</Q>.—<Q>He! he! he! Mamma what a ridiculous Fashion that must be! What has a Woman a fine Skin for but to shew it? or if she has not a fine Skin, what has she Paint for but to make a fine Skin? And then Mamma, what could the Petticoat be?</Q>—<Q>Why Child, it looks as if in those Days they wore a Cover∣ing for their Limbs down from the Waist as low as the Ankle.</Q>—<Q>He! he! he! says Miss, what has a Woman Legs for but to shew 'em? And then Mamma, I sup∣pose by Crown-whist that the People in those Days were so penurious, and so pitiful, and so careful as only to play for Crowns?</Q>—<Q>Yes, Child, says Mamma, that is pretty plain, and keeping <HI>Sundays</HI> was then made a Crime, and three Hundred Card-Tables was then counted a Thing of Consequence</Q>—<Q>Well, Mam∣ma, I am as glad as any thing I was not born in those grave, formal Times.</Q></P>
<P>This, or something not unlike it, will most assuredly be the Language of the rising Generation, and if Improve∣ments are made in other Branches, such as the <HI>national Debt, Atheism, &amp;c.</HI> I persuade myself, that whatever the Admirers of the Antients may urge at present, our Superiority will then be incontestible.</P>
<P>Pleased with the Prospect of this happy Period, I will here lay down my Pen, and subscribe myself Mr. <HI>Ranger</HI>'s</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T is observed by <HI>Horace,</HI> that in a long Work an Author may very lawfully indulge him∣self with a Nap; on this Account I shall make no Apology for having been occa∣sionally caught nodding; on the contrary, I shall make an Account of the various Occurrences, I lately met with in my Sleep, the Subject of this Day's Paper.</P>
<P>I dreamt, that, being on board a Merchantman, upon a Voyage, which indispensible Business obliged me to make, we were drove by Distress of Weather far to the Southward in the <HI>Great Pacific</HI> Ocean, and that, in the Night-Time, we were suddenly thrown on the Shore of an Island totally unknown to the Ship's Crew. While
<PB N="318" REF="321"/>they were, next Morning, all Hands at Work to get off the Ship, I adventured farther up into the Country, and had not journeyed far, when I perceived myself to be in the Land of the <HI>Houyhnhnms,</HI> mentioned by Capt. <HI>Gul∣liver,</HI> in his Travels, and in a little Time me∣thought I met with the same Master <HI>Houyhnhnm</HI> with whom that accurate Traveller so long conversed. As he had before seen one of my Species I was freed from the disagreeable Circumstances of being stared at, and shew∣ed about, in the Manner we do a tall Man or a short Woman in <HI>England.</HI> The Master <HI>Houynhnhnm</HI> immedi∣ately took me into a private Apartment, and began to question me concerning the State of <HI>Europe,</HI> and that of <HI>Great Britain</HI> in particular. He asked me whether the same Vices were still in fashion among us, and more especially whether that List of Enormities, which <HI>Gul∣liver</HI> had mentioned to him were still continued in Prac∣tice; such as <HI>Robbing, Stealing, Cheating, Pimping, For∣swearing, Flattering, Suborning, Forging, Gaming, Lying, Fauning, Hectoring, Voting, Scribbling, Star-gazing, Poi∣soning, Whoreing, Canting, Libelling, Freethinking,</HI> and the like. I told him they flourished with as much, if not more Vigour, than ever, and that two of them, <HI>viz. Gaming</HI> and <HI>Libelling</HI> encreased and gathered Strength every Day; that there are several in the Metropolis of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> who professedly live by them; that in order to carry on the former, <HI>viz.</HI> Gaming, with Ala∣crity, there are several Societies formed, where they meet with a Design upon one another's Pockets, which was introductory of another Crime, not mentioned by <HI>Gulliver,</HI> viz. <HI>Suicide;</HI> this I took some Pains to ex∣plain, and then he fetched a deep Groan at the Pride and Arrogance of human Nature. I added, that the <HI>Female Yahoos</HI> amongst us were all turned absolute Gamesters, and kept Routs, Drums, Hurricanes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for the Purposes of Play. I remember I had a very sensible Pleasure in calling the fair Gamesters by the
<PB N="319" REF="322"/>Name of <HI>Female Yahoos,</HI> because I really think that Term very aptly appropriated to them, when they re∣linquish their native Delicacy, and become a Prey to all the tormenting Passions of Gaming. I further informed the Master <HI>Houyhnhnm,</HI> that Libelling is now in greater Vogue than ever, and that a Society was formed for that Purpose by a Set of Scribblers, who call themselves <HI>Critical and Monthly Reviewers,</HI> and from their obscure Haunts attack the Reputation of every Man; whom they dislike for no Motive, except that strong Antipathy which Dullness and Malice always have to Genius and a fair Fame. The worthy <HI>Houyhnhnm</HI> here fetched a second Groan, hurt by a Reflection on the Baseness of human Nature: He then enquired about his former Ac∣quaintance, Capt. <HI>Gulliver,</HI> and said he looked upon him to be exempt from all the mean fordid Vices of his Species. Whereupon I informed him, that <HI>Gulliver</HI> was only that celebrated Person's travelling Name; that in <HI>Europe</HI> he was known by the immortal Name of Doctor <HI>Swift;</HI> as I am particularly fond of the Writings of that great Genius, and never travel without them, I informed the <HI>Houyhnhnm,</HI> that I had his Works in my Chest, and if he would per∣mit me to return to the Ship, I would have the Honour of presenting them to him. This Proposal was per∣fectly agreeable, and in a little Space of Time I came back with that elegant Edition of <HI>Swift</HI>'s Works lately publish'd by Mr. <HI>Hawksworth.</HI> In a few Days he read over the best Part of his Works, and was delighted with most of them, but more particularly with the faithful Account of the Conversation he formerly had with him, which, he said, was set down without the least Devia∣tion from Truth. He added, that the Account prefixed by Mr. <HI>Hawksworth,</HI> of the Author's Life was an ad∣mirable Composition. <Q>I observe, said he, that my old Acquaintance <HI>Gulliver,</HI> or <HI>Swift,</HI> was at once an Instance of the Dignity and the Imbecillity of human Nature; and the Writer of his Life, I am persuaded,
<PB N="320" REF="323"/>must have both a clear Head and a good Heart, be∣cause his Stile is properly concise, and always clear, strong and harmonious, and it is with a very percepti∣ble Regret that he speaks of the Infirmities of his Au∣thor; he seems tenderly to fling them into Shades, to soften away every thing unamiable, and to place his good Qualities in the most glaring Light.</Q> Finding the worthy <HI>Houyhnhnm</HI> to be very much pleased with this Performance of Mr. <HI>Hawksworth,</HI> I made him a Present of the <HI>Adventurer</HI> in four Volumes, which he received with a seeming Avidity, and chancing to light upon the Eastern Story of <HI>Carazan,</HI> the <HI>Merchant of Bagdat,</HI> he confessed himself delighted with the Moral which it in∣culcates, and amazed at his Warmth and Sublimity of Imagination.</P>
<P>The <HI>Houyhnhnm</HI> observed, when I presented the above Books to him, that I dropt a Paper, and in some Con∣fusion hastily snatched it up. This Paper was no other than Mr. <HI>Pons</HI>'s List of the Horses that run at <HI>New-mar∣ket,</HI> which I was desirous to conceal from him, but be∣ing urged to show it, he laughed at the Whimsicalness of the Conceit, as he supposed it to be, and he wondered Mr. <HI>Pons</HI> would say the Thing which was not. I assur'd him of the Veracity of the Account, and told him, however, incredible it might appear, that <HI>Jockeys</HI> rid Horses, or <HI>Houyhnhnms,</HI> at full speed for Wagers in many other Places in <HI>England,</HI> and that even the first Noble∣men would frequently ride their own Horses, and appear at a great Meeting no better than <HI>Jockeys</HI> and <HI>Grooms.</HI> To convince him further of the great Perfection we have attained in the Management of Horses, I produced to him <HI>A New System of Horsemanship from the</HI> French <HI>of Monsieur</HI> Bourgela<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, <HI>By</HI> Richard Berenger, <HI><ABBR>Esq</ABBR></HI> He at first laughed at the Impracticability of the Scheme, but upon my assur∣ing him, that the whole was sounded on the justest Ob∣servation, he immediately sent for another <HI>Houyhnhnm,</HI> and ordered me to mount him, in order to shew him the
<PB N="321" REF="324"/>Efficacy of the Rules. In vain I endeavoured to decline it by Apologies for my own Want of Dexterity; to en∣courage me he bid the <HI>Houyhnhnm</HI> not do me a Mischief, and I was obliged to vault into the Saddle, where I fixed myself upon the <HI>Twist, with a proper Grasp or Hold,</HI> and <HI>that too without employing any Strength, but trusting entirely to the Balance of my Body. I employed a quick and feeling Hand,</HI> and then made him advance, go back, turn to the right and lest according to my own Will and Pleasure. The Master <HI>Houyhnhnm,</HI> was surprized to see me have so absolute a Command; the <HI>Volte,</HI> the <HI>Demivolte,</HI> the <HI>Gallop,</HI> the several <HI>Passades,</HI> the <HI>Terre-a-Terre,</HI> the <HI>Mezair,</HI> the <HI>Curvet, &amp;c.</HI> were Matters of Astonish∣ment to him, and when I alighted the <HI>Houyhnhnm,</HI> which I rode, declared that several Times, his Pride being picqued, he attempted to fling me, but that by a quick Turn of the Wrist, he found his Power totally taken away from him. The Master again carried me into his Apart∣ment, and after expressing a due Degree of Astonish∣ment, <Q>Surely, said he, the Person who can thus, in so elegant and perspicuous a Manner, put together a System of Rules for subduing the noble Race of <HI>Houy∣hnhnms,</HI> must make great Attainments, whenever he turns his Thoughts to other Matters.</Q> I answered, that his Conjecture was perfectly just; that the Author had published that Performance because Riding is his fa∣vourite Excercise, and that it is to be hoped he will some Day handle other Topics, with that Taste and De∣licacy with which this Composition shews he can treat ordinary Things.—<Q>No Doubt, says the <HI>Huyhnhnm,</HI> when he thus touches on what it seems in <HI>England,</HI> is but the common Business of Life, but he must display great Elegance, when he discusses Matters of more Re∣finement. I own I should be glad to converse with him, tho' I consider him as a kind of Enemy, and I hope he is a seafaring Man, that I may have some Chance of seeing him here one time or other.</Q> Up∣on
<PB N="322" REF="325"/>hearing the Author was designed by Birth, Genius, and Education to shine in another Sphere, he de∣clar'd himself sorry, and in Compliance with my Re∣quest, gave me Leave to return to the Ship, which was by this Time got off the Shore. I therefore kissed his Hoof, which he raised for me, as he formerly did to <HI>Gulliver,</HI> and after desiring his Compliments to the Edi∣tor of <HI>Swift</HI>'s <HI>Works,</HI> and the Author of the <HI>System of Horsemanship,</HI> he dismissed me with a serious Admonition to avoid the Meannesses and the several fordid Vices of hu∣man Nature. Whereupon I took my final Leave, and re∣turned to my Companions. We sailed with a prosperous Wind, and, meeting but few Accidents in our Voyage, in a short Time, arrived at <HI>Gravesend.</HI> My Joy at finding myself once more in <HI>Old England</HI> was so great, that I expressed myself in the Language of the Country I came from, and awakened out of my Sleep crying out HOUYHNHNM.</P>

<P>This Day CHARLES RANGER, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> appeared at the Bar of this Court, upon an Indictment found against him, for that he wantonly and indiscreetly from Time to
<PB N="323" REF="326"/>Time in his <HI>Gray</HI>'s-<HI>Inn Journal</HI> made too free with Cha∣racters which had not offended him, to the great Unea∣siness of the Persons so attacked, and against the Statute recorded by <HI>Horace, Sublato jure nocendi, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ranger</HI> objected to several who were summoned to be on the Jury, offering various Reasons as Occasion requir∣ed, such as <HI>Dulness, Ignorance, Prejudice, &amp;c.</HI> At length this Point being adjusted, the Cause was opened by Counsellor <HI>Fester,</HI> who spared neither Elocution nor Elo∣quence to inflame the Mind of the Court, and the Gen∣tlemen impanelled against the Prisoner at the Bar. Ma∣ny Instances, he insisted, could be pointed out of personal Resentment, and Malice prepense, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> After which, several Passages of <HI>Ranger</HI>'s Writings were read in Court, and several Witnesses appeared to enforce the Charge exhibited against him.—Among these were <HI>Quinbus Flestrin,</HI> from the <HI>Bedford</HI> Coffee House; <HI>Bob Nankeen, Nat Pigtail, Harry Lappel, Jack Oakstick, Jem∣my Scratch,</HI> from the City; Mr. <HI>Mac Gregor,</HI> Mr. <HI>Broad∣brim,</HI> Mr. <HI>Shallow, &amp;c.</HI> from the Robinhood Society; Mons. <HI>Bourguignon,</HI> Mons. <HI>Languedoc,</HI> Mons. <HI>Bernard;</HI> Mons. <HI>Soup meagre; &amp;c.</HI> from <HI>Tom</HI>'s in <HI>Cornhill,</HI> and <HI>Slaughter</HI>'s in <HI>St. Martin</HI>'s <HI>Lane; Moses Aminadab, Selim Levi, Rubens Shylock,</HI> &amp;c. from <HI>Dukes-Place;</HI> and some others from various Parts of the Town; all these de∣posed, that the Prisoner had indulged himself in frequent Strokes of Pleasantry upon them, and they therefore hoped the Jury would bring in a Verdict accordingly.</P>
<SP>
<STAGE>Prisoner's Defence.</STAGE>
<P><HI>May it please this honourable Court, and you Gentlemen of the Jury.</HI></P>
<P>The Imputation of wantonly making free with Characters that had not given any personal Offence, is a Point I must speak a few Words to, be∣cause I think it a very fallacious Argument, and
<PB N="324" REF="327"/>if it be supposed to carry any Weight, it may be suffici∣ent to tie up the Hands of every Satyrist. It is not ne∣cessary, that a ridiculous Character should tread upon an Author's Toe, or offend him in some other Manner; without that, he is free Game for every Sportsman of the Qui'l; and that this is Mr. POPE'S Opinion appears from the following Lines;
<Q><L><HI>And must no Egg in</HI> Japhet'<HI>s Face be thrown,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Because the Deed he forg'd was not my own?</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>I must farther declare before this honourable Court, that I never saw one of these Gentlemen, who have appeared against me, in my Life.—Their Faces, their Persons, their Characters, are to me perfectly unknown: and therefore I presume, it may be fairly inferred, that I never meant to give the least Annoyance to any one in particular—They were all Personages of my own Creati∣on, and something like them I imagined might exist in Nature, and therefore I fansied I had a Right to lash or banter any Vice or Folly under imaginary Names, with∣out intending a personal Application in any one Instance. Having said thus much, I think it unnecessary in so plain a Cafe to take up the Time of the Court, to whose equitable Decisions I implicitly resign myself.</P>
<P>Hereupon the Jury withdrew, and in a few Minutes brought in their Verdict NOT GUILTY, to the great Sa∣tisfaction of <HI>Ranger</HI> and his Friends, and the Disappoint∣ment of the Group of Witnesses mentioned above. The Lord Chief Justice of the Court then broke his Staff, de∣clared his Commission to be annulled, and the censorial Court was finally dismissed.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG> SPIRIT of Enterprize administers to the Heart, in which its Pulsations are felt, the strongest and most glowing Pleasures our Constitutions can admit; Doubts and Fears may arise, but they are soon quenched by sanguine Hope; Success hovers over the young Schemist's Head; Fame stands in a Corner of the Picture, which fond Fancy has framed, blowing her immortal Trumpet, and Happiness and gay Serenity dart in sprightly Vibrations through his Soul. Happy, were the golden dream ne∣ver to evaporate! But Clouds arise that blot the intel∣lectual Radiance, and as soon as the Beams of Imagi∣nation are diminished, the Passions, like Flowers at the Setting Sun, immediately are contracted, the Spirits, that expanded every Nerve, sink in their Channels, sub∣side into Languor, and Satiety takes Possession of the Mind. I remember, to have met with a Story of a prime Minister to <HI>Pyrrhus,</HI> who seems to have had a shrewd Turn of Humour. When the King happened, in the full Rapture of Expedition, and his Imagination dilated with Ideas of future Conquest, to expatiate at large upon the various Incidents of his growing Enterprize: <Q>Pray Sir, (says he) what does all this tend to? Why, cries the Monarch, I shall add the neighbouring Na∣tions to my Dominions.—Well! and what then, pray? Why then I shall declare War against the adjacent
<PB N="326" REF="329"/>States.—And what then, Sir? I shall proceed in my Conquests, and the next Province shall receive my Yoke.—And what then, Sir? Why their Neigh∣bours shall also pay Tribute — This is very well, my Liege, and what next?—Thus I shall gradually ex∣tend my Victories till I become Master of the Globe. —And what then?—Then—why,—then I'll sit down and crack a Bottle with my Friends— And pray, Sir, why not do so now?</Q> This Passage has always appeared to me to carry with it a very fine Stroke of Satyr, and I am inclinable to think, that if the greatest Hero of Antiquity, were to make up the Account of his Happiness, he would find it not one Jot more than is here implied.</P>
<P>But among all the various Adventurers who must feel this Truth, there is no Set of <HI>Quixotes</HI> who experience it more powerfully than the Race of Authors. What Happiness does not the periodical Writer enjoy in the first dawning of a new Plan?—In Proportion as one Idea awakens a new Train of pleasing Images, and the Design opens to his View, what Sensations unfelt be∣fore? What Chearfulness, what Fancy, what luxuriant Wit? And when a Sheet, yet wet, is sent him from the Press for his Inspection, how his Heart bounds to see himself in print!—the Fineness of the Paper!— How it pleases him! The Elegance of the Type! —How its Symmetry strikes the Eye! The Correct∣ness of the Compositor!—How just and how exact! —Flushed with these Ideas the Imagination expands itself, and in the Fulness of Self-Admiration, he ad∣dresses himself in the Words of <HI>Hamlet</HI>—"What a Piece of Work is Man! How noble in Reason! How infinite in Faculties!"—And yet pass but a few Hours, and how changed is every Trace of Reflection! The Critics gather round him, and, like the Harpies in the third <HI>Aeneid,</HI> they break in upon his Meal, and like them too, they denounce Penury and Famine. The
<PB N="327" REF="330"/>Learned meet his work by Chance; they speak of it, but not with sufficient Warmth, because Men of Sense never admire, and only approve. He ther runs up and down among the Pamphlet Shops; in many they have not heard of it; he calls for it in Coffee-Houses, "Sir, we don't take it in"—In Places where it is used, he sees it twisted into a thousand different Shapes, the Paper and Print neglected, and the Stile unregarded; the Waiters throw it among the common Lumber, and Gentlemen keep Snuff in it. These, and many other Indignities arise to mortify an Author's Pride; and be∣sides all this, the Novelty of the Performance will wear off with him, as well as his Readers, and even Fame, supposing the good natured World allow him his full Portion, will thrill by degrees with feebler Impulse to his Heart-Strings, and in the Conclusion, I believe, he will find, that, Hero like, he cannot drink his Bottle with greater Pleasure than when he first set out.</P>
<P>Add to this, that there is a Concurrence of Circum∣stances, which never sail to render the Profession of an Author more uneasy than any other Station in Life.</P>
<P>The courtly <HI>Roman</HI> Satyrist has attacked, with all the elegant Touches of his delicate Raillery, that prevailing Spirit of Uneasiness, which renders People discontented with their own Situation in Life, and envious of the apparent Felicity of their Neighbours; but in the Lift of Male-Contents, which he has produced, I have of∣ten wondered, that he has not thought proper to enrol the Race that write. The Occasion of this might pos∣sibly be, that Authors have more solid Reasons than any other Class of Beings, to repine and murmur at their Occupation, and to wish that Fate had assigned them an Employment, in which they might partake more of the Ease and the Enjoyments of Life.</P>
<P>And indeed, considering the great Disproportion of Intenseness between the Labours of the Mind, and those of the Body, I do not know whether <HI>Juvenal</HI>'s Advice
<PB N="328" REF="331"/>to be an Auctioneer rather than a Poet, is not entirely eligible; for it is certain, that those nice Faculties of Perception, of which the literary Enthusiast is possessed, as they are the Inlets of our most refined intellectual Pleasures, so they are also, from the Quickness and De∣licacy of their Feeling, susceptible of the most acute Degrees of Pain, and in the same Proportion that they administer to Happiness, they may also improve and sharpen the Edge of Misery; in like Manner as the String, from which the skilful Artist elicits a de∣lightful Strain of Music, is also capable of returning the disagreeable Sounds of jarring Discord.</P>
<P>Of this Truth, I believe every Writer is convinced, who is actuated by an honest Ambition to acquit himself with Honour in his Calling; for I by no Means intend to speak at present of those vain Scribblers, who are for ever happy in their own Self Admiration, and who are intirely Strangers to the Agitations of Mind, attendant on a Genius, studious of correcting and polishing his Piece. In fine Writing, there are so many intricate Points, which demand Attention, that it must be with the utmost Solicit de the Task is ever accomplished. Justness of Conception, and Truth in every Turn of Wit are indispensible Requisites; nothing can excuse the Want of Delicacy of Sentiment; the Sallies of Imagi∣nation, and the frolic Gambols of Invention must be restrained by Severity of Judgment, and all must be expressed with Perspicu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ty and Strength of Diction. Besides this, a proper Arrangement of Periods, follow∣ing one another with graceful Variety, must unite the whole into Harmony, as the Painters express themselves, when they give the last finishing Hand to their colouring, and throw that general Glow upon their Piece, which at the first Glance strikes the intelligent Spectator. But the Truth of it is, the Traces of a Mind, which can think with Cl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arness and Vigour upon any Subject, and pursue a Series of Ideas, one emerging from another,
<PB N="329" REF="332"/>and tending gradually to form an intire whole, are so seldom discovered, that there is Reason to think it an Accomplishment unattainable, without the most assiduous Efforts of Study, and many Moments of Care and Anxiety.</P>
<P>An honest and fair Fame is among the Instigations, which incite an Author to undergo all this mental Fa∣tigue; but even that very Inducement is of so unstable a Nature, the Acquisition of it so uncertain, and the Te∣nure so precarious, that I believe, what at first looked so inviting to the Imagination, becomes at length the Writer's greatest Torment. Add to this, the great Hardship of pleasing that Multiplicity of Appetites, with which Mankind abound, and the still greater Dif∣ficulty, which every Man of Genius experiences, to please his own private Taste. Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> tells us, in the general Preface to his Works, that he never wrote up to his own Ideas of Poetry; and <HI>Boileau,</HI> who is second to no Man for sound Sense and Judgment, observes, that an Author of Elevation in his Conceptions, is conti∣nually discontented with his Performances, is pleasing to all the World, except himself, and, while his Wit is every where admired, that, for his own inward Quiet, he sincerely wishes he had never dipt his Pen in Ink.</P>

<P>I have been led into this Tract of Thought by a Re∣view of my own Sensations, ever since I undertook the anxious Character of a public Writer, which I have now sustained for the Space of two Years, and ha∣ving swelled these Essays to a sufficient Number, I pur∣pose next <HI>Saturday</HI> finally to take Leave of my Rea∣ders. In doing this, I must own, that I perform a kind
<PB N="330" REF="333"/>of Self-denial, as I shall then break off an habitual In∣tercourse with the Public, from which I have occasionally deduced a very sensible Pleasure, as I have experienced that these Papers, such as they are, have, from Time to Time, conduced to the Entertainment of the Town. On this Account I shall abdicate with Reluctance; but the Line, which I have quoted in my Motto from <HI>Horace,</HI> has for a long Time stared me in the Face. <Q>The Shame does not lie,</Q> says he, <Q>in playing the Fool, but in not discontinuing it,</Q> in the Justice of which Sentiment I acquiesce, and, as becomes me, conform to the Precept.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>S I am now arrived to the conclusive Essay of the <HI>Gray's Inn</HI> Journal, the Mask must be dropped; and the assumed Character of the Gay <HI>Charles Ranger</HI> must at length dwindle into that of the real Author, who begs Leave this Day to address his Readers in his own Name.</P>
<P>I remember the Introductory Paper to this Undertak∣ing embarrassed my Imagination, more than any succes∣sive Composition; as coming into Company is sometimes attended with uneasy Flutterings, which are afterwards effaced by Habit. As I am also desirous of going off with as good a Grace as possible, I cannot but be a little solicitous about the Manner of my Exit. In the social Intercourse of Life, I know as little Ceremony should be used, as the Nature of all Things will admit; but the periodical Writer, cannot withdraw, without mak∣ing his Bow to the Public.</P>
<P>Two different Forms of writing have offered them∣selves to me upon this Occasion. The first has been prac∣tised by several Gentlemen of the Quill, and consists in a declamatory Stile against that degeneracy of Taste, which has too fatally prevailed in the present Declension of Literature. In Addition to this, I might indulge myself in a Vein of Invective against the general Dis∣position to Gaming, and many other unavailing Amuse∣ments, which have called off the Attention of the better Sort of People from all literary Productions. I might further expatiate in a Strain of Raillery on the Fair, and might urge, that Woman is very justly defined by the
<PB N="333" REF="336"/><HI>Greek</HI> Pholosopher, <HI>"An Animal delighting in Finery,"</HI> and that it is not in the Power of the best Writers of the Age, to attract the Attention of that wandering Sex, who are evermore entertained with the Chit-chat, which issues from their own pretty red Lips, than with a Perusal of a Composition, calculated to retrench their Follies, to regulate their Fancy, to improve their Intel∣lectuals, and to encourage them to the Acquisition of those mental Beauties, such as Sweetness of Temper, Affability, and good Sense, which will be always sure to confer upon them the most permanent Embellishments, and will prove the best Wash for the Complexion, and an infallible Preservative against the Encroachments made upon the Tincture of the Skin, by Envy, Malice, Tea, Scandal, and painful Watchings at a Gaming-Table. After this I might pompously declare, that I now decline taking any further Trouble with those incorrigible An∣gels; that I consign them entirely to their Hair-Cutters, their Dancing Masters, and, what is still worse, to their own ungoverned fantastic Appetites. But this Form of Composition is inconsistent with my present Purpose, as I should be glad to lay down the Pen in the good Graces of all my Readers.</P>
<P>The second Method of Address which occurred to me, was that used by the excellent and humorous Author of the <HI>Tale of a Tub.</HI> After his Example, I have been tempt∣ed to return Thanks, in the most solemn Manner, to his Majesty's most honourable Privy-Council, to the Lords spiritual and temporal, to the honourable the House of Commons, to the Gentlemen of the Royal Society, to the Worshipful the Board of Aldermen, to the Club at <HI>White</HI>'s, to the Cricies at the <HI>Bedford,</HI> to the Con∣no'sseurs at <HI>Sam</HI>'s, to the Society of <HI>Grub-strect,</HI> and, in short, to all Degrees and Ranks of People, for the just and favourable Reception they have been pleased to af∣ford to the most delectable, humorous, and instructive Lucubrations, that we have publish'd in this our <HI>Gray</HI>'s <HI>Inn
<PB N="334" REF="337"/>Journal,</HI> which has been the Delight of the choice Spirits of the Age, the Terror of all Offenders against Decency and Good-Manners, and which has ascertained to the Author an immortal Reputation;
<Q><L><HI>Jamquè opus exegi quod nec Jovis ira, nec ignes,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Nec poterit serrum, nec edax abolere vetustas.</HI></L></Q> But having considered this Matter with sufficient Delibe∣ration, I have judged it eligible to decline both the Spe∣cies of Writing above exhibited. The Truth of it is, as on the one Hand I am not so self-sufficient as to arro∣gate to myself any extraordinary Pride from the Degree of Success I have met with; so on the other, I do not think I can reasonably find any Fault with the Disposi∣tion of the Public to the present Writer. I have all a∣long steered between the two Extremes of partial popu∣lar Applause, and a general Neglect; and I have there∣fore no colourable Pretence to express the least Degree of Discontent at Parting, nor vain-gloriously to exult at the Applause, which has been occasionally allowed to me.</P>
<P>I am too sensible, that a small Portion of Fame can be attributed to the Productions of a young Author, hur∣ried down the Stream of Dissipation, interrupted by Avo∣cations of a thousand Sorts, seldom enabled to write at Leisure, frequently obliged to dismiss the uncorrected Sheet to the Press, rarely happy enough to have written up even to his own Taste, and often checked in his Ca∣reer by the Timidity of an Adventurer, who was always diffident of his own Abilities, and was sensible how far so young a Writer must be from those strong Powers of Mind, which, when matured by Age and Application, animate and embolden Genius, give Authority to Criti∣cism, add Strength to Compositions of a graver Cast, and inspire an Author with a due Degree of Confidence
<PB N="335" REF="338"/>in his Decisions, upon all Occurrences in human Life, as likewise upon all Topics of Taste and Erudition.</P>
<P>Though unattended with these Advantages, it is, however, some kind of Satisfaction, that I have been able to procure myself an Audience once a Week for two Years together, from perhaps several Thousands in <HI>Great Bri∣tain;</HI> and, on this Occasion, I cannot help taking to my∣self a secret Pleasure from the Reflection, that I have given a kind of Weekly Memorial of my Existence, and force Sort of Proof, that my Time has not been thrown <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> in a Manner totally unavailing. <HI>Salust</HI> has a very fine Sentiment, which has made a very deep Im∣pression on me. <HI>Verum enimvero is demum mihi vivere, &amp; frui animâ videtur, qui aliquo negotio intentus, praeclari sacinoris aut artis honae famam quaerit.</HI> <Q>He may be said to live, says that excellent Writer, and to enjoy the Functions of his Soul, who, engaged in a laudable Occupation, endeavours to distinguish himself by some splendid Action, or by the Acquisition of Fame in some liberal Art.</Q> That I have in the last Way made myself conspicuous, I cannot persuade myself in my most most sanguine Moments; but I shall always enjoy the pleasure easure of a well meant Endeavour, and, when I look back to the Commencement of this Undertaking, and revieiew the Means, by which I have kept my Paper alive, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> will not be so prudish as to conceal a Degree of Self-Approbation.</P>
<P>The Plan, on which I have wrote, however f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ble the Execution of it may be, I am inclined to believe is not void of Merit. In the Essay, there was room for all Lands of fine Writing, and in the News, there was am∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> room to entertain the Fancy with Touches of Hu∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>r upon the various Occurrences of human Life. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> this Scheme has not been better cultivated in all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> arts, must be imputed to my having wrote singly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>; and this Consideration will, I hope, ren∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Inaccuracies more excusable.</P>
<P><PB N="336" REF="339"/>When I say, that I have wrote alone, I do not mean that I never received any Assistance. On the contrary, I think it incumbent on me to acknowledge, that a par∣ticular Friend, who must be nameless, has furnished me occasionally with several humorous Paragraphs of News, written with a Delicacy of Humour peculiar to himself; and, I will add, that I never withdrew from his Conversation, without some Hint for the Entertain∣ment of my Readers. To this Gentleman I am in∣debted for a Letter from an <HI>Englishman</HI> in <HI>Paris,</HI> No. 14; for a Scene at-<HI>Jonathan</HI>'s <HI>Coffee-House,</HI> No. 19; for an Essay on I heatrical Parties, No. 31; for an Essay on the modern Fashion of visiting, No. 34; for a second Scene at <HI>Jonathan</HI>'s, No. 57; and for the Essays in 98 and 100. That I have not received more from him, I have often thought it both a Loss to the <HI>Gray</HI>'s-<HI>Inn Journal</HI> and the Public; as he possesses an elegant Facility on every Subject, I sincerely wish that I had been able to prevail upon him, against his natural Indolence, to afford me a great deal more of his Assistance.</P>
<P>A Paper upon what may be called Imitation in Wri∣ting, and an Essay towards the fixing the Standard of modern Criticism, together with some occasional Strokes of Humour in the true Intelligence, were the Contribu∣tions of another ingenious Gentleman, whose Friend∣ship, I am convinced, would have inclined him to do something toward raising the Estimation of this Paper much higher, had not Avocations of more Consequence to himself and the Public, demanded the Exertion of his excellent Abilities in another Way.</P>
<P>I must take this Opportunity to thank the Author of a Letter, occasioned by my Criticism on King <HI>Lear,</HI> which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in the Warmth of Friendship, and, in my Opi∣tion, was written also in the Warmth of Genius. An ingerious Essay on <HI>Physiognomy</HI> was also a Present from the Author of <HI>Phil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lea;</HI> the Letter, No. 12, upon a <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> the Ladies Teeth,</HI> is a <HI>Jeu d'Esprit</HI> by a
<PB N="337" REF="340"/>Gentleman of a very elegant and lively Fancy. And now and then, in the News there are either Articles sent by unknown Hands, or Paragraphs raised upon their Hints. But of these the Number is extremely small; for every Thing else <HI>Ranger</HI> himself must stand account∣able.</P>
<P>I have now, I think, faithfully mentioned all the Assistance I received in the Course of this Paper, and upon this Appearance of Matters, I believe, it will be sound very short of the Advantages enjoyed by some of my Brother Writers. I have not had the Happiness of being puff'd in any of our common News Papers, or in that entertaining and truly useful Work, as Mr. <HI>Griffiths</HI> calls the <HI>Monthly Review.</HI> I have never been able to en∣tertain the Town with the Writings of People of Fashion, nor to lay before them an <HI>Essay written by a Person of Honour;</HI> I could never boast the Friendship of the Nobility, nor has any Lord sent me a Paper, and upon Publication bought up a thousand Copies, to shew me how well his own Performances sell. I must, how∣ever, own, that I have always exerted my utmost Abilities, and have put every thing out of hand with as much Care as the Nature of periodical Productions, the Author's Spirits, and other Circumstances would permit. I have ever had as great a Respect for the Public, as <HI>Tully</HI> pro∣fesses for a <HI>Roman</HI> Assembly, and I agree with him when he says, <HI>nihil huc nisi perfectum ingenio, elaboratum in∣dustriâ afferri opportere.</HI> At the same Time, I hope, it will be considered, what Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> observes with great Propriety, that the Public should not expect that an Au∣thor's whole Time should be spent in polishing and re∣touching for their Pleasures.</P>
<P>Besides, why may not a Person rather chuse an Air of bold Negligence, than the obscure Diligence of Pedants, and Writers of affected Phraseology? For my Part, I have always thought an easy Stile more eligible than a pompous Diction, lifted up by Metaphor, amplisied
<PB N="338" REF="341"/>by Epithet, and dignisied by too frequent Insertions of the <HI>Latin</HI> Idiom. I am therefore inclined to flatter my∣self, that my Expression has been natural and unambi∣tious; and that my Arrangement has been grammatically just, unperplexed and clear, and that upon all Occa∣sions I have written with some Degree of Purity.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, if I cannot boast of having pro∣duced edifying Strains of Morality, Dissertations of uncontrovertible Criticism, and Papers of exquisite Mirth and Humour, I hope, at least the whole Plan has been conducted with a strict Regard to Decency, and without any Offence against Virtue or good Manners. To this Circumstance, I believe it in a great Measure owing, that I have been so savourably received by the Town; but be the Cause, what it may, I shall always retain a grateful Sense of their Indulgence, and in what∣ever Way, hereafter I may endeavour to entertain them, I shall think they have a Demand upon me for the most vigorous Exertion of my Abilities, and, let my Success∣be as it will, I at least hope I shall have Judgment enough not entirely to mistake my Talents.</P>
<P>Having avowed these Sentiments I shall conclude without any studied flourish of Period, and I remain with great Respect to all my Readers in particular, and to the Public in general,</P>
