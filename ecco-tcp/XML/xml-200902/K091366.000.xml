<HEAD>THE AUTHOR'S APOLOGY.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>MY works are advertis'd for sale,</L>
<L>And censures fly as thick as hail;</L>
<L>While my poor scheme of publication</L>
<L>Supplies the dearth of conversation.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What will the <HI>World</HI> say?—That's your cry.</L>
<L>Who is this <HI>World?</HI> and what am I?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Once, but thank heaven, those days are o'er,</L>
<L>And persecution reigns no more,</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="18"/>
<HI>One</HI> man, <HI>one</HI> hardy man alone,</L>
<L>Usurp'd the critic's vacant throne,</L>
<L>And thence with neither taste or wit,</L>
<L>By powerful catcall from the pit,</L>
<L>Knock'd sarce, and play, and actor down.</L>
<L>Who pass'd the sentence then?—the Town.</L>
<L>So now each upstart puny elf</L>
<L>Talks of the <HI>world,</HI> and means <HI>himself.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet in the circle there are those</L>
<L>Who hurt e'en more than open foes:</L>
<L>Whose friendship serves the talking turn,</L>
<L>Just simmers to a kind concern,</L>
<L>And with a wond'rous soft expression</L>
<L>Expatiates upon indiscretion;</L>
<L>Flies from the Poems to the Man,</L>
<L>And gratifies the favourite plan</L>
<L>To pull down other's reputation,</L>
<L>And build their own on that foundation.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Scholar grave, of taste discerning,</L>
<L>Who lives on credit for his learning,</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="19"/>
And has no better claim to wit</L>
<L>Than carping at what others writ,</L>
<L>With pitying kindness, friendly fear,</L>
<L>Whispers conjectures in your ear.</L>
<L>"I'm sorry — and he's much to blame—</L>
<L>"He might have publish'd—but his name!</L>
<L>"The thing might please a few, no doubt,</L>
<L>"As handed privately about—</L>
<L>"It might amuse a friend or two,</L>
<L>"Some partial friend, like me or you;</L>
<L>"But when it comes to press and print</L>
<L>"You'll find, I fear, but little in't.</L>
<L>"He stands upon a dangerous brink</L>
<L>"Who totters o'er the sea of ink,</L>
<L>"Where reputation runs aground,</L>
<L>"The author cast away, and drown'd,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"And then—'twas wilful and absurd,</L>
<L>"(So well approv'd, so well preferr'd,)</L>
<L>"Abruptly thus a place to quit,</L>
<L>"A place which most his genius hit,</L>
<L>"The theatre for Latin wit!</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="20"/>
"With critics round him chaste and terse,</L>
<L>"To give a plaudit to his verse!"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Latin, I grant, shews college breeding,</L>
<L>And some school-common-place of reading.</L>
<L>But has in <HI>Moderns</HI> small pretension</L>
<L>To real wit or strong invention.</L>
<L>The excellence you critics praise</L>
<L>Hangs on a curious choice of phrase;</L>
<L>Which pick'd and chosen here and there,</L>
<L>From prose or verse, no matter where,</L>
<L>Jumbled together in a dish,</L>
<L>Like Spanish olio, fowl, flesh, fish,</L>
<L>You set the classic hodge-podge on</L>
<L>For pedant wits to feed upon.</L>
<L>Your wou'd-be Genii vainly seek</L>
<L>Fame from their Latin verse, or Greek;</L>
<L>Who would for that be most admir'd</L>
<L>Which blockheads may, and have acquir'd.</L>
<L>A mere mechanical connection</L>
<L>Of favourite words,—a bare collection</L>
<L>Of phrases,—where the labour'd cento</L>
<L>Presents you with a dull memento,</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="21"/>
How <HI>Virgil, Horace, Ovid</HI> join,</L>
<L>And club together half a line.</L>
<L>These only strain their motley wits</L>
<L>In gathering patches, shreds, and bits,</L>
<L>To wrap their barren fancies in,</L>
<L>And make a classic Harlequin.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>—Were I at once impower'd to shew</L>
<L>My utmost vengeance on my foe,</L>
<L>To punish with extremest rigour,</L>
<L>I could inflict no pennance bigger</L>
<L>Than using him as learning's tool,</L>
<L>To make him Usher of a school.</L>
<L>For, not to dwell upon the toil</L>
<L>Of working on a barren soil,</L>
<L>And lab'ring with incessant pains</L>
<L>To cultivate a blockhead's brains,</L>
<L>The duties there but ill befit</L>
<L>The love of letters, arts, or wit.</L>
<L>For whosoe'er, tho' slightly, sips</L>
<L>Their grateful flavour with his lips,</L>
<L>Will find it leave a smatch behind,</L>
<L>Shall sink so deeply in the mind,</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="22"/>
It never thence can be eras'd—</L>
<L>But, rising up, you call it <HI>Taste.</HI></L>
</LG>

<L>A gusto, which he cannot use.</L>
<L>Better discard the idle whim,</L>
<L>What's <HI>He</HI> to <HI>Taste?</HI> or <HI>Taste</HI> to <HI>Him?</HI></L>
<L>For me, it hurts me to the soul</L>
<L>To brook confinement or controul;</L>
<L>Still to be pinion'd down to teach</L>
<L>The syntax, and the parts of speech;</L>
<L>Or, what perhaps is drudging worse,</L>
<L>The links, and joints, and rules of verse;</L>
<L>To deal out authors by retail,</L>
<L>Like penny pots of <HI>Oxford</HI> ale;</L>
<L>—Oh! 'tis a service irksome more</L>
<L>Than tugging at the slavish oar.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet such <HI>his</HI> task, a dismal truth,</L>
<L>Who watches o'er the bent of youth;</L>
<L>And while, a paltry stipend earning,</L>
<L>He sows the richest seeds of learning,</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="23"/>
And tills <HI>their</HI> minds with proper care,</L>
<L>And sees them their due produce bear,</L>
<L>No joys, alas! his toil beguile,</L>
<L>His <HI>own</HI> lies fallow all the while.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Yet still he's in the road, you say,</L>
<L>"Of learning."—Why, perhaps, he may.</L>
<L>But turns like horses in a mill,</L>
<L>Nor getting on, nor standing still:</L>
<L>For little way his learning reaches,</L>
<L>Who reads no more than what he teaches.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Yet you can send advent'rous youth,</L>
<L>"In search of letters, taste, and truth,</L>
<L>"Who ride the highway road to knowlege</L>
<L>"Through the plain turnpikes of a college."</L>
<L>True.—Like way-posts, we serve to shew</L>
<L>The road which travellers shou'd go;</L>
<L>Who jog along in easy pace,</L>
<L>Secure of coming to the place,</L>
<L>Yet find, return whene'er they will,</L>

Which stands an useful unthank'd guide,</L>
<L>To many a passenger beside.</L>

<L>A sprig at least to circle mine!</L>

<L>Yet tell me, while you censure me,</L>

Ambition, splendour, may be thine;</L>
<L>Ease, indolence, perhaps, are mine.</L>
<L>Though prudence, and our nature's pride</L>
<L>May wish our weaknesses to hide,</L>
<L>And set their hedges up before 'em,</L>
<L>Some sprouts will branch, and straggle o'er 'em.</L>
<L>Strive, fight against her how you will,</L>
<L>Nature will be the mistress still,</L>
<L>And though you curb with double rein,</L>
<L>She'll run away with us again.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But let a man of parts be wrong,</L>
<L>'Tis triumph to the leaden throng.</L>
<L>The fools shall cackle out reproof,</L>
<L>The very ass shall raise his hoof;</L>
<L>And he who holds in his possession,</L>
<L>The single virtue of discretion,</L>
<L>Who knows no overflow of spirit,</L>
<L>Whose want of passions is his merit,</L>
<L>Whom wit and taste and judgment flies,</L>

<HEAD>PART OF HOMER'S HYMN TO APOLLO. Translated from the Greek.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>GOD of the Bow! Apollo, thee I sing;</L>
<L>Thee, as thou draw'st amain the sounding string,</L>
<L>Th' immortal pow'rs revere with homage low,</L>
<L>And ev'ry godhead trembles at thy bow.</L>
<L>All but Latona: She with mighty Jove</L>
<L>Eyes thee with all a tender parent's love;</L>
<L>Closes thy quiver, thy tough bow unbends,</L>
<L>And high amid th' aethereal dome suspends,</L>
<L>Then smiling leads thee, her all-glorious son,</L>
<L>To share the mighty Thunderer's awful throne.</L>
<L>Goblets of nectar thy glad fire prepares,</L>
<L>And thee, his fairest, noblest son declares;</L>
<L>While ev'ry god sits rapt, Latona's breast</L>
<L>Beats with superior joy, and hails her son confest.</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="28"/>
Thrice blest Latona! from thee, Goddess, sprung</L>
<L>Diana chaste, and Phoebus ever-young:</L>
<L><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Delos and ortygia are mentioned as different Islands in the original.</NOTE> Her in Ortygia's isle, and Him you bore</L>
<L>At Cynthius' hill on Delos' sea-girt shore,</L>
<L>Where the tall palm uprears its lovely head,</L>
<L>And clear Inopus laves the slow'ry mead.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O Phoebus, where shall I begin thy praise?</L>
<L>Well can'st thou rule the poet's artless lays.</L>
<L>Oft on the craggy rock, or mountain hore,</L>
<L>By river-side, or on the sea's hoarse shore,</L>
<L>Wand'ring well-pleas'd, with music's magic sound,</L>
<L>And airs divine, thou charm'st the region round.</L>
<L>Say, shall I sing how first on Delos' shore</L>
<L>Thee, glorious progeny, Latona bore <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Here several verses, containing nothing but a mere list of the names of Islands, are omitted.</NOTE>?</L>
<L>How first, from other isles, beset with grief,</L>
<L>In vain thy tortur'd mother sought relief.</L>
<L>Each to her out-cast woe denied abode,</L>
<L>Nor durst one isle receive the future god.</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="29"/>
At length to Delos came the lab'ring fair,</L>
<L>And suppliant thus besought her needful care.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Delos! receive Apollo, and O! raise</L>
<L>A glorious temple to record his praise!</L>
<L>Then shall He govern thee with gentle sway,</L>
<L>And only Phoebus shall thine isle obey.</L>
<L>What though no flocks, nor herds, nor juicy vine,</L>
<L>Nor plants of thousand natures shall be thine,</L>
<L>Swift to the temple of the Bowyer-king<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Bowyer-king</HI> and <HI>Bowyer-god</HI> are expressions frequently used by Dryden, in his version of the first Iliad, to signify Apollo.</NOTE>,</L>
<L>Oblations rich shall ev'ry nation bring;</L>
<L>For ever from thy altars shall arise</L>
<L>The fragrant incense of burnt-sacrifice.</L>
<L>No longer then regret thy barren soil,</L>
<L>Receive the God, and live by other's toil!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>She spake: with inward rapture Delos smil'd,</L>
<L>And sooth'd the suppliant pow'r with answer mild.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Latona! mighty Caeus' daughter fair,</L>
<L>Full willingly wou'd Delos ease thy care,</L>
<L><PB N="14" REF="30"/>
Full willingly behold her barren earth</L>
<L>Witness the glories of Apollo's birth:</L>
<L>The mighty God wou'd raise my lowly name,</L>
<L>And consecrate his native isle to fame.</L>
<L>One fear alone distracts my beating heart;</L>
<L>That fear, O Goddess, list while I impart.</L>
<L>Second to none amid th' aethereal skies,</L>
<L>Apollo soon all terrible shall rise:</L>
<L>All nations shall adore the mighty God,</L>
<L>And kings and kingdoms tremble at his nod.</L>
<L>Haply (for ah! dire fears my soul infest,</L>
<L>And fill with horror my tumultuous breast)</L>
<L>Soon as the glorious Godhead shall be born,</L>
<L>My desert region will he view with scorn,</L>
<L>Indignant spurn me, curse my barren soil,</L>
<L>And plunge into the waves my hated isle.</L>
<L>Triumphant then to happier climes remove,</L>
<L>There fix his shrine, plant there his sacred grove.</L>
<L>Whelm'd in the briny main shall Delos lay,</L>
<L>To all the finny brood a wretched prey.</L>
<L>But, O Latona! if, to quell my fear,</L>
<L>You'll deign a solemn sacred oath to swear,</L>
<L><PB N="15" REF="31"/>
That here the God his glorious seat shall hold,</L>
<L>And here his sapient oracles unfold,</L>
<L>Your sacred burthen here, Latona, lay,</L>
<L>Here view the Godhead bursting into day.</L>

<L>In Delos shall Apollo's shrine be rear'd,</L>

<L>Nine hapless days and nights, with writhing throes,</L>
<L>And all the anguish of a mother's woes,</L>
<L>Latona tortur'd lay; in sorrowing mood,</L>
<L>Around her many a sister-goddess stood,</L>
<L>Alost in heaven imperial Juno sat,</L>

<L>Lucina too; the kind assuaging pow'r</L>
<L>That tends the lab'ring mother's child-bed hour,</L>
<L><PB N="16" REF="32"/>
And mitigates her woes, in golden clouds</L>
<L>High on Olympus' top the Goddess shrouds.</L>
<L>Her large full eyes with indignation roll,</L>
<L>And livid envy seiz'd her haughty soul,</L>
<L>That from Latona's loins was doom'd to spring</L>
<L>So great a son, the mighty Bowyer-king.</L>
<L>The milder pow'rs, that near the lab'ring fair</L>

<L>Fair Iris sent, the many colour'd maid,</L>

<L>But charg'd her heed, lest Juno shou'd prevent</L>
<L>With prohibition dire their kind intent.</L>
<L>Fleet as the winged winds, the flying fair</L>

<L>Olympus gain'd, apart she call'd the maid,</L>
<L>Then sought with many a pray'r her needful aid,</L>
<L>And mov'd her soul: when soon with dove-like pace</L>
<L>Swiftly they measur'd back the viewless airy space.</L>

<L>Soon as to Delos' isle Lucina came</L>
<L>The pangs of travail seiz'd Latona's frame.</L>

Her twining arms she threw the palm around,</L>
<L>And prest with deep-indented knee the ground:</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Sister Pow'rs that round Latona stood</L>
<L>With chaste ablutions cleans'd the infant-god.</L>
<L>His lovely limbs in mantle white they bound,</L>
<L>And gently drew a golden swathe around.</L>
<L>He hung not helpless at his mother's breast,</L>
<L>But Themis fed him with an heavenly feast.</L>
<L>Pleas'd while Latona views the heavenly boy,</L>
<L>And fondly glows with all a mother's joy,</L>
<L>The lusty babe, strong with ambrosial food,</L>
<L>In vain their bonds or golden swathes withstood,</L>
<L>Bonds, swathes, and ligaments with ease he broke,</L>

<L>He spake; and onwards all majestic strode;</L>
<L>The Queens of Heaven awe-struck view'd the God.</L>

Delos beheld him with a tender smile,</L>
<L>And hail'd, enrich'd with gold, her happy isle;</L>

<L>There gladly celebrate Apollo's name</L>

Milton, like thunder, rolls along</L>

<L>Others, who aim at fancy, chuse</L>
<L>To wooe the gentle Spenser's Muse.</L>
<L>This poet fixes for his theme</L>
<L>An allegory, or a dream;</L>
<L>Fiction and truth together joins</L>
<L>Through a long waste of flimsy lines;</L>
<L>Fondly believes his fancy glows,</L>

<L>Others, more daring, fix their hope</L>
<L>On rivaling the fame of Pope.</L>
<L>Satyr's the word, against the times—</L>
<L>These catch the cadence of his rhymes,</L>
<L>And borne from earth by Pope's strong wings,</L>
<L>Their Muse aspires, and boldly flings</L>
<L>Her dirt up in the face of kings.</L>

<L>AGAIN I urge my old objection,</L>

<L>And the severity of Taste</L>
<L>Has laid the walk of genius waste.</L>
<L>Fancy's a flight we deal no more in,</L>

<L>But still you cry in sober sadness,</L>
<L>"There is discretion e'en in madness."</L>
<L>A pithy sentence, which wants credit!</L>
<L>Because I find a poet said it:</L>
<L>Their verdict makes but small impression,</L>
<L>Who are known liars by profession.</L>

<L>Had Shakespeare crept by modern rules,</L>
<L>We'd lost his Witches, Fairies, Fools:</L>

They so exactly poise the scale</L>
<L>That neither measure will prevail,</L>

<L>'Tis true, their tawdry works are grac'd</L>

<L>Say did you never chance to meet</L>
<L>A monsieur-barber in the street,</L>

<L>With little dabs of Dresden laces,</L>
<L>While for the body Monsieur Puff,</L>
<L>Wou'd think e'en dowlas fine enough?</L>

<HEAD>The SATYR and PEDLAR, 1757.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>WORDS are, so Wollaston defines,</L>
<L>Of our ideas merely signs,</L>
<L>Which have a pow'r at will to vary,</L>
<L>As being vague and arbitrary.</L>
<L>Now <HI>damn'd</HI> for instance—all agree,</L>
<L><HI>Damn'd</HI>'s the <HI>superlative degree;</HI></L>
<L>Means <HI>that</HI> alone, and nothing more,</L>
<L>However taken heretofore;</L>
<L><HI>Damn'd</HI> is a word can't stand alone,</L>
<L>Which has no meaning of its own,</L>
<L>But signifies or bad or good</L>
<L>Just as its neighbour's understood.</L>
<L>Examples we may find enough,</L>
<L><HI>Damn'd</HI> high, <HI>damn'd</HI> low, <HI>damn'd</HI> fine, <HI>damn'd</HI> stuff.</L>
<L>So fares it too with its relation,</L>
<L>I mean its substantive, <HI>damnation.</HI></L>
<L>The wit with metaphors makes bold,</L>
<L>And tells you he's <HI>damnation</HI> cold;</L>
<L><PB N="40" REF="56"/>
Perhaps, that metaphor forgot,</L>
<L>The self-same wit's <HI>damnation</HI> hot.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And here a fable I remember—</L>
<L>Once in the middle of December,</L>
<L>When ev'ry mead in snow is lost,</L>
<L>And ev'ry river bound with frost,</L>
<L>When families get all together,</L>
<L>And feelingly talk o'er the weather;</L>
<L>When—pox on the descriptive rhyme—</L>
<L>In short it was the winter time.</L>
<L>It was a Pedlar's happy lot,</L>
<L>To fall into a Satyr's cot:</L>
<L>Shiv'ring with cold, and almost froze,</L>
<L>With pearly drop upon his nose,</L>
<L>His fingers' ends all pinch'd to death,</L>
<L>He blew upon them with his breath.</L>
<L>"Friend, quoth the Satyr, what intends</L>
<L>"That blowing on thy fingers ends?</L>
<L>"It is to warm them thus I blow,</L>
<L>"For they are froze as cold as snow.</L>
<L><PB N="41" REF="57"/>
"And so inclement has it been</L>
<L>"I'm like a cake of ice within."</L>
<L>Come, quoth the Satyr, comfort, man!</L>
<L>I'll chear thy inside, if I can;</L>
<L>You're welcome in my homely cottage</L>
<L>To a warm fire, and mess of pottage.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>This said, the Satyr, nothing loth,</L>
<L>A bowl prepar'd of sav'ry broth,</L>
<L>Which with delight the Pedlar view'd,</L>
<L>As smoaking on the board it stood.</L>
<L>But, though the very steam arose</L>
<L>With grateful odour to his nose,</L>
<L>One single sip he ventur'd not,</L>
<L>The gruel was so wond'rous hot.</L>
<L>What can be done?—with gentle puff</L>
<L>He blows it, 'till its cool enough.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Why how now, Pedlar, what's the matter?</L>
<L>Still at thy blowing! quoth the Satyr.</L>
<L>I blow to cool it, cries the Clown,</L>
<L>That I may get the liquor down:</L>
<L><PB N="42" REF="58"/>
For though I grant, you've made it well,</L>
<L>You've boil'd it, fir, as hot as hell.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then raising high his cloven stump.</L>
<L>The Satyr smote him on the rump.</L>
<L>"Begone, thou double knave, or fool,</L>
<L>"With the same breath to warm and cool:</L>
<L>"Friendship with such I never hold</L>

<HEAD>The ACTOR. ADDRESS'D TO BONNELL THORNTON, Esq.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>ACTING, dear Thornton, its perfection draws</L>
<L>From no observance of mechanic laws:</L>
<L>No settled maxims of a fav'rite stage,</L>
<L>No rules deliver'd down from age to age,</L>
<L>Let players nicely mark them as they will,</L>
<L>Can e'er entail hereditary skill.</L>
<L>If, 'mongst the humble hearers of the pit,</L>
<L>Some curious vet'ran critic chance to sit,</L>
<L>Is he pleas'd more because 'twas acted so</L>
<L>By Booth and Cibber thirty years ago?</L>
<L>The mind recals an object held more dear,</L>
<L>And hates the copy, that it comes so near.</L>
<L>Why lov'd we Wilks's air, Booth's nervous tone?</L>
<L>In them 'twas natural, 'twas all their own.</L>
<L>A Garrick's genius must our wonder raise,</L>
<L>But gives his mimic no reflected praise.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="66" REF="82"/>
<L>Thrice happy Genius, whose unrival'd name,</L>
<L>Shall live for ever in the voice of Fame!</L>
<L>'Tis thine to lead, with more than magic skill,</L>
<L>The train of captive passions at thy will;</L>
<L>To bid the bursting tear spontaneous flow</L>
<L>In the sweet sense of sympathetic woe:</L>
<L>Through ev'ry vein I feel a chilness creep,</L>
<L>When horrors such as thine <HI>have murder'd sleep;</HI></L>
<L>And at the old man's look and frantic stare</L>
<L>'Tis Lear alarms me, for I see him there.</L>
<L>Nor yet confin'd to tragic walks alone,</L>
<L>The Comic Muse too claims thee for her own.</L>
<L>With each delightful requisite to please,</L>
<L>Taste, Spirit, Judgment, Elegance, and Ease,</L>
<L>Familiar nature forms thy only rule,</L>
<L>From Ranger's rake to Drugger's vacant fool.</L>
<L>With powers so pliant, and so various blest,</L>
<L>That what we see the last, we like the best.</L>
<L>Not idly pleas'd, at judgment's dear expence,</L>
<L>But burst outrageous with the laugh of sense.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="67" REF="83"/>
<L>Perfection's top, with weary toil and pain,</L>
<L>'Tis genius only that can hope to gain.</L>
<L>The Play'r's profession (tho' I hate the phrase,</L>
<L>'Tis so <HI>mechanic</HI> in these modern days)</L>
<L>Lies not in trick, or attitude, or start,</L>
<L>Nature's true knowlege is his only art.</L>
<L>The strong-felt passion bolts into the face,</L>
<L>The mind untouch'd, what is it but grimace?</L>
<L>To this one standard make your just appeal,</L>
<L>Here lies the golden secret; learn to FEEL.</L>
<L>Or fool, or monarch, happy, or distrest,</L>
<L>No actor pleases that is not <HI>possess'd.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Once on the stage, in Rome's declining days,</L>
<L>When Christians were the subject of their plays,</L>
<L>E'er persecution dropp'd her iron rod,</L>
<L>And men still wag'd an impious war with God,</L>
<L>An actor flourish'd of no vulgar fame.</L>
<L>Nature's disciple, and Genest his name.</L>
<L>A noble object for his skill he chose,</L>
<L>A martyr dying 'midst insulting foes.</L>
<L><PB N="68" REF="84"/>
Resign'd with patience to religion's laws,</L>
<L>Yet braving monarchs in his Saviour's cause.</L>
<L>Fill'd with th' idea of the secret part,</L>
<L>He felt a zeal beyond the reach of art,</L>
<L>While look and voice, and gesture, all exprest</L>
<L>A kindred ardour in the player's breast;</L>
<L>Till as the flame thro' all his bosom ran,</L>
<L>He lost the Actor, and commenc'd the Man:</L>
<L>Profest the faith, his pagan gods denied,</L>
<L>And what he acted then, he after died.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Player's province they but vainly try,</L>
<L>Who want these pow'rs, <HI>Deportment, Voice,</HI> and <HI>Eye.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Critic Sight 'tis only <HI>Grace</HI> can please,</L>
<L>No figure charms us if it has not <HI>Ease.</HI></L>
<L>There are, who think the stature all in all;</L>
<L>Nor like the hero, if he is not tall.</L>
<L>The feeling sense all other want supplies,</L>
<L>I rate no actor's merit from his size.</L>
<L>Superior height requires superior grace,</L>
<L>And what's a giant with a vacant face?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="69" REF="85"/>
<L>Theatric monarchs, in their tragic gait,</L>
<L>Affect to mark the solemn pace of state.</L>
<L>One foot put forward in position strong,</L>
<L>The other, like its vassal, dragg'd along.</L>
<L>So grave each motion, so exact and slow,</L>
<L>Like wooden monarchs at a puppet-show.</L>
<L>The mien delights us that has native grace,</L>
<L>But affectation ill supplies its place.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Unskilful actors, like your mimic apes,</L>
<L>Will writhe their bodies in a thousand shapes;</L>
<L>However foreign from the poet's art,</L>
<L>No tragic hero but admires a start.</L>
<L>What though unfeeling of the nervous line,</L>
<L>Who but allows his <HI>attitude</HI> is fine?</L>
<L>While a whole minute equipois'd he stands,</L>
<L>Till praise dismiss him with her echoing hands!</L>
<L>Resolv'd, though nature hate the tedious pause,</L>
<L>By perseverance to extort applause.</L>
<L>When Romeo sorrowing at his Juliet's doom,</L>
<L>With eager madness bursts the canvas tomb,</L>
<L><PB N="70" REF="86"/>
The sudden whirl, stretch'd leg, and listed staff,</L>
<L>Which please the vulgar, make the critic laugh.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To paint the passion's force, and mark it well,</L>
<L>The proper action nature's self will tell:</L>
<L>No pleasing pow'rs distortions e'er express,</L>
<L>And nicer judgment always loaths excess.</L>
<L>In sock or buskin, who o'erleaps the bounds,</L>
<L>Disgusts our reason, and the taste confounds.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Of all the evils which the stage molest,</L>
<L>I hate your fool who overacts his jest:</L>
<L>Who murders what the poet finely writ,</L>
<L>And, like a bungler, haggles all his wit,</L>
<L>With shrug, and grin, and gesture out of place,</L>
<L>And writes a foolish comment with his face.</L>
<L>Old Johnson once, tho' Cibber's perter vein</L>
<L>But meanly groupes him with a num'rous train,</L>
<L>With steady face, and sober hum'rous mien,</L>
<L>Fill'd the strong outlines of the comic scene.</L>
<L>What was writ down, with decent utt'rance spoke,</L>
<L>Betray'd no symptom of the conscious joke;</L>
<L><PB N="71" REF="87"/>
The very man in look, in voice, in air,</L>
<L>And tho' upon the stage, appear'd no Play'r.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The word and action should conjointly suit,</L>
<L>But acting words is labour too minute.</L>
<L>Grimace will ever lead the judgment wrong;</L>
<L>While sober humour marks th' impression strong.</L>
<L>Her proper traits the fixt attention hit,</L>
<L>And bring me closer to the poet's wit;</L>
<L>With her delighted o'er each scene I go,</L>
<L>Well-pleas'd, and not asham'd of being so.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But let the generous Actor still forbear</L>
<L>To copy features with a Mimic's care!</L>
<L>'Tis a poor skill, which ev'ry fool can reach,</L>
<L>A vile stage-custom, honour'd in the breach.</L>
<L>Worse as more close, the disingenuous art</L>
<L>But shews the wanton looseness of the heart.</L>
<L>When I behold a wretch, of talents mean,</L>
<L>Drag private foibles on the public scene,</L>
<L>Forsaking nature's fair and open road</L>
<L>To mark some whim, some strange peculiar mode,</L>
<L><PB N="72" REF="88"/>
Fir'd with disgust I loath his servile plan,</L>
<L>Despise the mimic, and abhor the man.</L>
<L>Go to the lame, to hospitals repair,</L>
<L>And hunt for humour in distortions there!</L>
<L>Fill up the measure of the motley whim</L>
<L>With shrug, wink, snuffle, and convulsive limb;</L>
<L>Then shame at once, to please a trifling age,</L>
<L>Good sense, good manners, virtue, and the stage!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Tis not enough the Voice be found and clear,</L>
<L>'Tis modulation that must charm the ear.</L>
<L>When desperate heroines grieve with tedious moan,</L>
<L>And whine their sorrows in a see-saw tone,</L>
<L>The same soft sounds of unimpassioned woes</L>
<L>Can only make the yawning hearers doze.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The voice all modes of passion can express,</L>
<L>That marks the proper word with proper stress,</L>
<L>But none emphatic can that actor call,</L>
<L>Who lays an equal emphasis on <HI>all.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="73" REF="89"/>
<L>Some o'er the tongue the labour'd measures roll</L>
<L>Slow and delib'rate as the parting toll,</L>
<L>Point ev'ry stop, mark ev'ry pause so strong,</L>
<L>Their words, like stage-processions, stalk along.</L>
<L>All affectation but creates disgust,</L>
<L>And e'en in speaking we may seem <HI>too</HI> just.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nor proper, Thornton, can those sounds appear</L>
<L>Which bring not numbers to thy nicer ear:</L>
<L>In vain for them the pleasing measure flows,</L>
<L>Whose recitation runs it all to prose;</L>
<L>Repeating what the poet sets not down,</L>
<L>The verb disjointing from its friendly noun,</L>
<L>While pause, and break, and repetition join</L>
<L>To make a discord in each tuneful line.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Some placid natures fill th' allotted scene</L>
<L>With lifeless drone, insipid and serene;</L>
<L>While others thunder ev'ry couplet o'er,</L>
<L>And almost crack your ears with rant and roar.</L>

<L>More nature <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and finer strokes are shown,</L>

<L>More powerful terror to the mind conveys,</L>

<L>Bullies the bulky phantom off the stage.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He, who in earnest studies o'er his part,</L>
<L>Will find true nature cling about his heart.</L>
<L>The modes of grief are not included all</L>
<L>In the white handkerchief and mournful drawl;</L>
<L>A single look more marks th' internal woe,</L>
<L>Than all the windings of the lengthen'd Oh.</L>
<L>Up to the Face the quick sensation flies,</L>
<L>And darts its meaning from the speaking Eyes;</L>
<L>Love, transport, madness, anger, scorn, despair,</L>
<L>And all the passions, all the soul is there.</L>

<LG>
<L>In vain Ophelia gives her flowrets round,</L>

In Cibber's look commanding sorrows speak,</L>
<L>And call the tear fast trick'ling down my cheek.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>There is a fault which stirs the critic's rage;</L>
<L>A want of due attention on the stage.</L>
<L>I have seen actors, and admir'd ones too,</L>
<L>Whose tongues wound up set forward from their cue;</L>
<L>In their own speech who whine, or roar away,</L>
<L>Yet seem unmov'd at what the rest may say;</L>
<L>Whose eyes and thoughts on diff'rent objects roam,</L>
<L>Until the prompter's voice recal them home.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Divest yourself of hearers, if you can,</L>
<L>And strive to speak, and be the very man.</L>
<L>Why should the well-bred actor wish to know</L>
<L>Who sits above to-night, or who below?</L>
<L>So, 'mid th' harmonious tones of grief or rage,</L>
<L>Italian squallers oft disgrace the stage;</L>
<L>When, with a simp'ring leer, and bow profound,</L>
<L>The squeaking Cyrus greets the boxes round;</L>
<L>Or proud Mandane, of imperial race,</L>
<L>Familiar drops a curt'sie to her grace.</L>

<L>To suit the dress demands the actor's art,</L>
<L>Yet there are those who over-dress the part.</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>When chilling horrors shake th' affrighted king,</L>
<L>And guilt torments him with her scorpion sting;</L>
<L>When keenest feelings at his bosom pull,</L>
<L>And fancy tells him that the seat is full;</L>
<L>Why need the ghost usurp the monarch's place,</L>

<L>If Belvidera her lov'd loss deplore,</L>

<L>And still pursues them with a frantic stare,</L>
<L>'Tis pregnant madness brings the visions there.</L>
<L>More instant horror would enforce the scene,</L>
<L>If all her shudd'rings were at shapes unseen.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Poet and Actor thus, with blended skill,</L>
<L>Mould all our passions to their instant will;</L>
<L>'Tis thus, when feeling Garrick treads the stage,</L>
<L>(The speaking comment of his Shakespear's page)</L>
<L>Oft as I drink the words with greedy ears,</L>
<L>I shake with horror, or dissolve with tears.</L>

For other purpose was that spot design'd:</L>
<L>To purge the passions, and reform the mind,</L>
<L>To give to nature all the force of art,</L>

<L>Thornton, to thee, I dare with truth commend,</L>
<L>The decent stage as virtue's natural friend.</L>
<L>Tho' oft debas'd with scenes profane and loose,</L>

<L>Tho' the lewd priest his sacred function shame,</L>
<L>Religion's perfect law is still the same.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Shall They, who trace the passions from their rise,</L>
<L>Shew scorn her features, her own image vice?</L>
<L>Who teach the mind it's proper force to scan,</L>
<L>And hold the faithful mirror up to man,</L>
<L>Shall their profession e'er provoke disdain,</L>
<L>Who stand the foremost in the mortal train,</L>
<L>Who lend reflection all the grace of art,</L>
<L>And strike the precept home upon the heart?</L>

<L>Yet, hapless Artist! tho' thy skill can raise</L>
<L>The bursting peal of universal praise,</L>
<L>Tho' at thy beck Applause delighted stands,</L>

<L>Know, fame awards thee but a partial breath!</L>
<L>Not all thy talents brave the stroke of death.</L>
<L>Poets to ages yet unborn appeal,</L>

<L>Tho' blended here the praise of bard and play'r,</L>
<L>While more than half becomes the Actor's share,</L>
<L>Relentless death untwists the mingled fame,</L>

<L>Then might Distraction rend her graceful hair,</L>

<L>Our author flies, but with no <HI>partial</HI> aim.</L>

<L>Books too he read, nor blush'd to use their store.—</L>

<L>I would be honest and sincere,</L>

<L>The modest world shou'd fleer and flout her,</L>
<L>With not a rag of cloaths about her?</L>

Come, nay, nay, nay, nay, be brief. These verses too, a poyson on 'em, I cannot abide 'em, they make me ready to cast, by the banks of Helicon.

<P>No, sir.</P>

<P>Yes, sir; I hear of a tragedy of yours coming forth for the common players there, call'd Medea. By my houshold-gods, if I come to the acting of it, I'll add one tragic part more than is yet expected to it; believe me when I promise it.

<P>Indeed, Marcus Ovid, these players are an idle generation, and do much harm in a state, corrupt young gentry very much, I know it: I have not been a tribune thus long and observ'd nothing; besides, they will rob us, us, that are magistrates, of our re∣spect, bring us upon their stages, and make us ridi∣culous

<SPEAKER>Tuc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Th'art in the right, my venerable cropshin, they will indeed, the tongue of the oracle never twang'd truer. Your courtier cannot kiss his mis∣stress's slippers in quiet for 'em; nor your white in∣nocent gallant pawn his revelling suit to make his punk a supper. An honest decay'd commander can∣not skelder, cheat, nor be seen in a bawdy-house, but he shall be strait in one of their wormwood comedies. They are grown licentious, the rogues; libertines, flat libertines. They forget they are i' the statute, the rascals; they are blazon'd there; there they are trick'd, they and their pedigrees; they need no other heralds, I wiss.</P>

<P>Methinks, if nothing else, yet this alone, the very reading of the public edicts, should fright thee from commerce with them, and give thee distaste enough of their actions. But this betrays what a

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ovid ju.</SPEAKER>
<P>They wrong me, sir, and do abuse you more, That blow your ears with these untrue reports. I am not known unto the open stage, Nor do I traffick in their theatres. Indeed, I do acknowledge, at request Of some meer friends, and honourable Romans, I have begun a poem of that nature.</P>

<P>Cornelius Gallus; There's another gallant too hath drunk of the same poison, and Tibullus and Propertius. But these are gentlemen of means and revenues now. Thou art a younger brother, and hast nothing but thy bare exhibition; which I protest shall be bare indeed, if thou forsake not these unprofitable by-courses, and that timely too. Name me a profest poet, that his poetry did ever afford him so much as a competency. I, your god of poets there (whom all of

<P>He says well: Nay, I know this nettles you now; but answer me, is't not true? You'll tell me his name shall live; and that (now being dead) his works have eternis'd him, and made him divine; but could this divinity feed him while he liv'd? could his name feast him?</P>

<P>Indeed, young Publius, he that will now hit the mark, must shoot through the Law; we have no other planet reigns, and in that sphere you may sit and sing with angels. Why, the Law makes a man happy,

<L>THY chieftain, France, of try'd illustrious worth,</L>
<L>By right of conquest king, by right of birth,</L>
<L>I sing. Who, tutor'd in misfortune's school,</L>
<L>There learnt the noblest science, how to Rule;</L>
<L>Bad Faction's furious discord cease to rave,</L>
<L>Valiant to conquer, merciful to save;</L>
<L>Baffled the daring League's rebellious schemes,</L>
<L>MAYENNE's proud hopes, and Spain's ambitious dreams:</L>
<L>With civil prudence blest, with martial fire,</L>
<L>A nation's conqueror, and a nation's fire.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Truth, heavenly maid, from th' Empyraean height</L>
<L>Descend, and with thy strong and purest light</L>
<L>My verse illume! and O, let mortals hear</L>
<L>Thy sacred word, and awfully revere!</L>

Be thou my guide! thy sage experience brings</L>
<L>Unerring maxims to the ear of kings.</L>
<L>'Tis thine, blest maid, and only thine, to show</L>
<L>What most befits the regal pow'r to know.</L>
<L>Purge thou the film from off a nation's eyes,</L>
<L>And shew what ills from civil discord rise!</L>
<L>Nor spare with decent boldness to disclose</L>
<L>The prince's errors, and the people's woes:</L>
<L>And O! if fable e'er, in times of yore,</L>
<L>Mix'd her soft accents with thy sterner lore,</L>
<L>If e'er her hand adorn'd thy tow'ring head,</L>
<L>And o'er thy front her milder graces spread;</L>
<L>If e'er her shades, which lovingly unite,</L>
<L>Bad thy fair form spring stronger into light,</L>
<L>With me, permit her all thy steps to trace,</L>
<L>Not to conceal thy beauties, but to grace!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Still VALOIS reign'd, and sunk in pleasure's bow'r,</L>
<L>O'er a mad state held loose the reigns of pow'r:</L>
<L>The trampled Law had lost its ancient force,</L>
<L>And Right confounded, miss'd her even course.</L>
<L><PB N="140" REF="154"/>
'Twas thus when VALOIS France's sceptre bore,</L>
<L>Scepter'd indeed, but now a king no more;</L>
<L>Not glory's minion now, the voice of fame</L>
<L>Swell'd the loud trumpet to the hero's name;</L>
<L>His laurels withered, and all blasted now,</L>
<L>Which conquest hung upon his infant brow;</L>
<L>Whose progress Europe mark'd with conscious fear,</L>
<L>Whose loss provoked his country's common tear,</L>
<L>When, the long train of all his virtues known,</L>
<L>The North admiring call'd him to the throne.</L>
<L>In second rank, the light which strikes the eyes,</L>
<L>Rais'd to the first, grows dim, and feebly dies.</L>
<L>From war's stern soldier, active, firm, and brave,</L>
<L>He sunk a monarch, pleasure's abject slave.</L>
<L>Lull'd with soft ease, forgetful all of state,</L>
<L>His weakness totter'd with a kingdom's weight;</L>
<L>While lost in sloth, and dead to glorious fame,</L>
<L>The sons of riot govern'd in his name.</L>
<L>QUELUS, St. MAIGRIN, death-cemented pair,</L>
<L>JOYEUSE the gay, and D' ESPERNON the fair,</L>

<L>Mean time, the GUISES, fortunate and brave,</L>

<L>The people blind, their sacred Monarch brav'd,</L>
<L>Led by those Tyrants, who their rights enslav'd.</L>
<L>His friends forsook him, helpless and alone,</L>
<L>His servants chas'd him from his royal throne;</L>
<L>Revolted Paris, deaf to kingly awe,</L>
<L>Within her gates the crouding stranger saw.</L>
<L>Through all the city burst rebellion's flame;</L>
<L>And all was lost, when virtuous BOURBON came;</L>
<L>Came, full of warlike ardour, to restore</L>
<L>That light his prince, deluded, had no more.</L>
<L>His active presence breath'd an instant flame;</L>
<L>No longer now the sluggish sons of shame,</L>
<L>Onward they press, where glory calls, to arms,</L>
<L>And spring to War from Pleasure's silken charms:</L>
<L>To Paris gates both kings advance amain,</L>
<L>Rome felt th' alarm, and trembled haughty Spain:</L>
<L>While Europe, watching where the tempest falls,</L>
<L>With anxious eyes beheld th' unhappy walls.</L>

<L>Within was DISCORD, with her hell-born train,</L>

<L>DISCORD, dread monster, deaf to human woe,</L>

A thousand heroes, eager for the fight,</L>

<P>THE Managers of Drury-Lane Theatre, think∣ing themselves bound to join the rest of the nation, in public congratulations of their Ma∣jesties, on their auspicious nuptials; the following little piece was written merely with a view of mani∣festing such their loyalty and gratitude, to the best of monarchs, and most candid encourager of theatrical exhibitions. The reader, as well as the spectator, will easily discover that, the author has paid but little attention to the nature of dramatic compo∣sition, in the conduct of this piece; and indeed, in the representation, the labours of the poet and the composer appeared very inferior to the elegant taste of the managers in the decoration.</P>
