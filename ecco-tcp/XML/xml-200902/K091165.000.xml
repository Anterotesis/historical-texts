</FIGURE></HEAD>
<P>I NATURALLY begin this little history with the account of <HI>Tre Eden Owain,</HI> the place where I first made my entrance into this busy world. The principal house in this township, <HI>Downing,</HI> was built in the year 1627.<NOTE PLACE="marg">DOWNING.</NOTE> It certainly had no pretensions to the <HI>English</HI> name of <HI>Downing,</HI> which doubtlessly was a corruption from <HI>Eden Owain,</HI> the <HI>Tre</HI> or township in which it stands. The founder was <HI>John Pennant,</HI> son of <HI>Nicholas Pennant,</HI> a younger son of <HI>Hugh Pennant,</HI> of <HI>Bychton.</HI> He married the heiress of the place, and built a house, which was much too large for the estate. The stones were brought from <HI>Nant-y-bi,</HI> a dingle opposite to the house. There is a tradition, that the stones were rolled along a platform from the top of the quarry, raised on an
<PB N="2" REF="10"/>
inclined plane till they reached the building, and there were ele∣vated as the work increased in height, till the whole was finished. The house is in form of a <HI>Roman</HI> H, a mode of architecture very common in <HI>Wales</HI> at that period. On the front is the pious motto frequent on the <HI>Welsh</HI> houses, <HI>Heb Dduw heb ddim, a duw a dig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n,</HI> which signifies,
<Q>Without God there is nothing, with God enough.</Q>
There were only four generations of this branch; <HI>Thomas,</HI> the last, died in 1724, and was buried in <HI>Whiteford</HI> church, on <HI>June</HI> 6th of the same year. He bequeathed his estate to my father, who made the house his residence; his own father being living, and the house much better than our paternal.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">M.

<Q>Ah, you rogue! I remember you when you had not a shirt to your back.</Q></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">ANTIENT MODE OF NURSING.</NOTE>I WAS, according to antient custom, put out to nurse at a neigh∣boring farm-house, called <HI>Pentre,</HI> covered with thatch, and which at present would be deemed a cottage. My nurse's maiden name was <HI>Pennant;</HI> and from the time of this great event she re∣sumed it, notwithstanding she had long used that of her husband, <HI>John Pierce,</HI> a freeholder of above a hundred a year. He and she were fond of this charge, which was ever esteemed a peculiar favor and honor. The affection and connection is still retained in many parts of <HI>Ireland;</HI> but what is unfortunate in more civilized <HI>Wales,</HI> both seem at present almost extinguished.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="11"/>OF the affection between the foster-father, foster-mother,<NOTE PLACE="marg">AFFECTION OF <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>OSTER FATHERS, &amp;c.</NOTE> and foster-brother, the instances were frequent. The fidelity of <HI>Robin ap Inko,</HI> foster-brother to <HI>Jevan ap Vychan,</HI> of the house of <HI>Gwedir,</HI> in the reign of <HI>Edward</HI> IV. was a most noted one. In a fatal feud between <HI>Jevan</HI> and his brother-in-law <HI>Rys ap Howel,</HI> the latter, expecting a fray, provided a butcher to murder <HI>Jevan</HI> in the confusion of the battle, and to him he gave orders in these terms. The butcher not being acquainted with <HI>Jevan, Ap Rys</HI> said,
<Q>Thou shalt soone discerne him from the rest by his stature, and he will make way before him. There is a foster-brother of his, one <HI>Robin ap Inko,</HI> a little fellow, that useth to match him behind: take heed of him, for be the encountre never soe hot, his eye is ever on his foster-brother;</Q>
—and so it happened. <HI>Robin</HI> suspected the treachery, and seeing the butcher watching his opportunity, came behind him and knocked him on the head in the moment in which he had come behind <HI>Jevan,</HI> and had aimed one at that of his beloved foster-brother. The patrimony of his faithful follower was in the parish of <HI>Llanderfel;</HI> and to this day retains the name of <HI>Tyddin Inko.</HI></P>
<P>IN those days there was great competition for the honor of fostering the children of great men.<NOTE PLACE="marg">HORRID MURDEN.</NOTE> The parson of <HI>Llanvrothen</HI> near <HI>Traeth-mawr,</HI> had taken a child of <HI>Jevan ap Robert</HI> to nurse. This so grieved the wife of <HI>Rys</HI> (her husband having more land in the parish than <HI>Jevan</HI> had) that she determined to have the poor parson put to death. A woman was sent to his house, who was kindly taken in. At midnight she set up hideous cries, pre∣tending that the parson had attempted to ravish her. This only was a pretence for revenge: the woman had, as the historian says,
<PB N="4" REF="12"/>
to her brethren three notable rogues
<Q>of the damned crew fit for any mischief, being followers of <HI>Howel ap Rys.</HI></Q>
These watched the parson, and as he went one morning to look to his cattle, cruelly murdered him; the sequel is told in the <HI>Welsh Tour,</HI> vol. i. p. 291, and the proper end of the villains.—These extracts are taken from the history of the <HI>Gwedir</HI> family, a curious pub∣lication, for which we are indebted to my true friend the Honor∣able <HI>Daines Barrington.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN I came into possession of <HI>Downing,</HI> by the death of my excellent father <HI>David Pennant,</HI> the house had partly transome, partly sashed windows. By consulting a drawing of it in that state, may be known the changes made by myself. With the estate, I luckily found a rich mine of lead ore, which enabled me to make the great improvements I did. The grounds were much hurt by a vile road running in front and on one side of the house, and through the middle of the demesne, to the hamlet called <HI>Gwibnant,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">GWIBNANT.</NOTE> or <HI>the meandring glen.</HI> The house was planted up almost to the door, which gave it a very melancholy gloom. But I soon laid open the natural beauties of the place, and by the friendly exchange Sir <HI>Roger Mostyn</HI> made with me, enlarged the fine scenery of the broken grounds, the woods, and the com∣mand of water. The walks in the near grounds, the fields, and the deep and darksome dingles, are at left three miles in extent, and the dingle not ill united with the open grounds, by a subter∣raneous passage under the turnpike road. I am not a little flattered by the admiration of those who visit the place. Mr. <HI>Boydel</HI> has published a fine engraving of the house among his <HI>Welsh</HI> feats. I have, as a head-piece to p. 1. of this Work, given it in the prettiest representation.</P>

<P>IN the near view below the house are the ruins of the abbey of <HI>Molandina:</HI> notwithstanding they are not very considerable, they do not want their beauties.

century a poor cottager, who lived near the spot, had a child who grew uncommonly peevish; the parents attributed this to the <HI>fair<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> and imagined that it was a changeling. They took the child, put it in a cradle, and left it all night beneath the tree, in hopes that the <HI>tylwydd têg,</HI> or <HI>fairy family,</HI> or the <HI>fairy folk,</HI> would restore their own before morning. When morning came they found the child perfectly quiet, so went away with it, quite confirmed in their belief. <HI>Shakspeare</HI> and <HI>Spenser</HI> allude to this popular fiction. <HI>Spenser</HI> is particularly allusive to the above:

Besides this oak is another, on a spot within the pleasure-grounds called <HI>Mount Airy.</HI> It probably is of superior age to that I have just mentioned; it is truly picturesque, and has in it furrows so deep, and of aspect so uncommonly venerable, as to render its shade as worthy of the solemn rites of the <HI>Druids,</HI> as those of <HI>Mona</HI> in its most prosperous days. At a small distance below are three ever∣green oaks, of a considerable size; I do not know how they came there, for the wood in my father's time was in a state of nature. Below those is a very antient towering oak of great size; and in a dingle, near the field called the <HI>Coxet,</HI> is a tree of the same species of great size and beauty, yet retaining the very habit of a vigorous sapling. These and a fine <HI>Spanish</HI> chesnut are the boast of my <HI>Sylvan</HI> shades.

<P>THE house itself has little to boast of.<NOTE PLACE="marg">HOUSE.</NOTE> I fortunately found it in∣capable of being improved into a magnitude exceeding the reve∣nue of the family. It has a hall which I prefer to the rural impro∣priety of a paltry vestibule; a library thirty feet by eighteen; a parlor capable of containing more guests than I ever wish to see at a time, <HI>Septem, convivium; novem, convicium!</HI> and a smoaking-room most antiquely furnished with antient carvings, and the horns of all the <HI>European</HI> beasts of chace. This room is now quite out of use as to its original purpose. Above stairs is a good drawing-room, in times of old called the dining-room, and a tea-room, the sum of all that are really wanted.—I have <HI>Cowley</HI>'s wish realized, a small house and large garden!</P>
<P>THE library is filled by a numerous collection of books,<NOTE PLACE="marg">LIBRARY.</NOTE> principally of history, natural history and classics. My own la∣bors might fill an ordinary book-room; many of them receive considerable value from the smaller drawings and prints with which they are illustrated on the margins, as well as by the larger intermixed with the leaves; among the latter are several draw∣ings of uncommon beauty, by that eminent hand Mr. <HI>Nicholas Pococke.</HI> These relate either to the <HI>Ferroe</HI> isles, or to <HI>Iceland,</HI> others to the distant <HI>Tibet</HI> or <HI>Boutan.</HI> I was favored, by <HI>John Thomas Stanley,</HI> <ABBR>esq</ABBR> with permission to have copies made of the first, and by <HI>Warren Hastings,</HI> <ABBR>esq</ABBR> of the last.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">PORTRAITS.</NOTE>THE parlor is filled with numbers of portraits, and other paintings. The greater part of the first are reduced from the originals by <HI>Moses Griffith,</HI> in a most masterly manner. A few excepted, they are family pictures. A very large one covers the end of the room; the figures are three quarters, and dressed in the manner in which <HI>Vandyk</HI> did his; the man has a remarkable good look, long hair, whiskers, and small beard: his wife is by him; between them a boy with a basket of flowers, and by him a gre-hound.<NOTE PLACE="marg">DAVID PEN∣NANT WIFE AND CHILD.</NOTE> These represent <HI>David Pennant,</HI> sheriff of the county in 1643, his wife <HI>Margaret Pennant,</HI> of <HI>Merton,</HI> and their eldest son <HI>Piers.</HI> This piece is done in a superior style, a good imitation of <HI>Vandyk.</HI> A grand column and a rich carpet is intro∣duced, a flattery of the artist, for in those days we were far from being able to pay for even a performance of that value. It pro∣bably was done in the troublesome times, when some painter of merit might have wandered about the country, and have been glad of working for his meat and his drink, and some trifle for other necessaries.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="19"/>MY great, great grandfather was an officer in the garrison of <HI>Denbigh,</HI> when it was besieged and taken by my maternal great, great grandfather general <HI>Mytton.</HI> My loyal ancestor suffered there a long imprisonment. <HI>Bychton</HI> was plundered, and the distress of the family so great, that he was kept from starving by force of conjugal affection; for his wife often walked with a bag of oatmeal from the parish of <HI>Whiteford</HI> to <HI>Denbigh</HI> to relieve his wants.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the zeal of his house for the loyal cause, it suffered very little in respect to the general composition of delinquents; the <HI>Bychton</HI> estate only paid 42<HI>l.</HI> 14<HI>s.</HI> whereas <HI>Robert Pennant,</HI> of <HI>Downing,</HI> paid not less than 298 <HI>l.</HI> for his estate, which was very far inferior to the other. The occasion was this: <HI>Robert Pennant</HI> had the misfortune to have a hot-headed young fellow in his house, when a small detachment of the adverse party, with a cornet at the head, approached the place. He persuaded the family to resist; the doors were barri∣cadoed, a musquet fired, and the cornet wounded. The house was soon forced, and of course plundered; but, such was the mode∣ration of the party, no carnage ensued, and the only revenge seems to have been the disproportionate fine afterwards levied.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING his brother <HI>Hugh</HI> is not delivered down to us on canvas,<NOTE PLACE="marg">MAIOR HUGH PENNANT.</NOTE> I cannot omit the mention of him as a brave and faithful officer in the royal army serving in <HI>North Wales.</HI> He attained the rank of major, and particularly distinguished himself in the isle of <HI>Anglesey.</HI> In 1648, that island, in imitation of several of the <HI>English</HI> counties, rose in order to set the king at liberty, and to restore monarchy to the oppressed kingdom. Numbers of royalists resorted to this island from different parts
<PB N="10" REF="20"/>
of <HI>North Wales,</HI> and made a general muster in the middle of the island, under the command of <HI>Thomas</HI> lord <HI>Bulkeley.</HI> The par∣lement determined on their reduction, and made <HI>Conwy</HI> the place of rendezvous. General <HI>Mytt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n</HI> was the commanding of∣ficer; he landed at <HI>Cadnant,</HI> where <HI>Hugh Pennant</HI> was posted, who, after undergoing a severe fire from the rocks and hedges, being left unsupported, was obliged to retreat. Two captains posted at <HI>Porth-aethwy,</HI> made so speedy a flight, that it was said that one of them at lest had previously received the bribe of 50 <HI>l.</HI> for his treachery. In the battle which soon after was fought near <HI>Beaumaris, Hugh Pennant</HI> charged the enemy with great spirit, and was very near taking that brave officer colonel <HI>Lo∣thian</HI> prisoner. Some others of the loyal officers conducted themselves with spirit; but, in general, the islanders are allowed by their own historian, a schoolmaster of <HI>Beaumaris,</HI> to have be∣haved very ill. An <HI>Anglesey</HI> captain was directed to keep the church: he posted his men in it, locked them safely up, and then ran away with the key in his pocket. The historian tells us, that he was called Captain <HI>Church</HI> to his dying day. They certainly had great valor at distant danger. As soon as the enemy appeared march∣ing over <HI>Penmaen-mawr,</HI> at lest four miles from <HI>Beaumaris,</HI> the <HI>Anglesey</HI> people began to bustle; drums beat, trumpets sounded, and great vollies of small shot and great were discharged; at which the enemy, says the sage pedagogue, took little or no no∣tice. Major <HI>Pennant</HI> was probably taken in <HI>Beaumaris</HI> castle, with the royal army, to which place it had retired after the de∣feat. As soon as he obtained his liberty he resided at <HI>Bryn-shone,</HI> in the parish of <HI>Yskivi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g,</HI> where he died on <HI>March</HI> 10th, 1669, and was interred at <HI>Whiteford.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="21"/>He was married to <HI>Margaret Aungier,</HI> baroness of <HI>Longford,</HI> one of the daughters of Sir <HI>Thomas Cave,</HI> of <HI>Slimford,</HI> in the county of <HI>Northampton,</HI> knight. This lady had four husbands; she paid our country the compliment of beginning and ending with a <HI>Welshman:</HI> her first was Sir <HI>John Wynne,</HI> of <HI>Gwedir,</HI> junior, they lived unhappily together, which sent him on his tra∣vels into <HI>Italy,</HI> where he died at <HI>Lucca.</HI> She then took one of the <HI>Milesian</HI> race, for she married Sir <HI>Francis Aungier,</HI> master of the rolls in <HI>Ireland,</HI> afterwards created baron of <HI>Longford.</HI> Thirdly, she gave her hand to an <HI>Englishman,</HI> Sir <HI>Thomas Wenman,</HI> of <HI>Oxfordshire;</HI> and, finally, she resigned her antiquated charms to our valiant major, who in the year 1656 deposited her with his ancestors, in the church at <HI>Whiteford.</HI></P>

<P>I CANNOT well ascertain the next portrait, which is of a hand∣some young man, in long hair, flowing and curling gracefully on his shoulders. He is dressed in the military dress of the time, a laced turn-over, and an elegant buff coat, much ornamented, and a musket with an aukward old lock in his hand, and a sword by his side. I suspect him to have been a son of <HI>Pyers Pennant,</HI> who was slain the ill-conducted expedition to the isle <HI>Rhi,</HI> under the duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> in 1627.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">SIR JOHN WYNNE, JUNIOR, KNIGHT.</NOTE>THIS is over the chimney-piece; above him is the portrait of Sir <HI>John Wynne,</HI> knight, who died on his travels at <HI>Lucca,</HI> in 1614. (It is taken from the original at <HI>Wynn-stay.</HI>) He was buried there, in the parish of St. <HI>John's.</HI> I have seen numbers of his letters, which shew him to have been a most observant man. He was eldest son of Sir <HI>John Wynne,</HI> of <HI>Gwedir.</HI> He is in black, has a large ruff, laced turn-over, and others at his wrists, a white girdle stuck with points, and a white belt passing over his shoulders and breast. His countenance is good, his hair short and dark, his beard small and peaked.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="29"/>THE next is opposite to the other,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SIR RICHARD WYNNE, BART.</NOTE> a head of Sir <HI>Richard Wynne,</HI> baronet, grandson to old Sir <HI>John,</HI> and last of the male line.</P>
<P>ABOVE Sir <HI>John Wynne</HI> is a very fine head of <HI>Charles</HI> I. by <HI>Vandyk.</HI> He is elegantly dressed in a red jacket,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHARLES I.</NOTE> slashed and laced. This was purchased at the sale of the late colonel <HI>Nor∣ton,</HI> of <HI>Southwick,</HI> in <HI>Hampshire,</HI> by my worthy friend the late <HI>Pusey Brooke,</HI> <ABBR>esq</ABBR> and gratefully presented by him to the late Mr. <HI>Edwards,</HI> of <HI>Brynford,</HI> to whom he lay under obligations. It was on his death presented to my father, and decreed to re∣main an heir-lome in the family.</P>
<P>OPPOSITE to <HI>Charles</HI> I. is another <HI>Charles,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">HIS GREAT GRANDSON.</NOTE> great grandson to the unfortunate monarch. It is a head in oil-colors, after the original by <HI>Hussey.</HI> He was a man uncommonly handsome: his fine brown hair is tied behind, and curled on the sides; his body and arms are clad in armor. In the field he certainly took too great care of his person, but I believe the armor to have been the painter's choice. His highness had given him∣self the two orders, for both the blue and the green ribbon grace his shoulders.</P>
<P>THIS picture was originally the property of the late Sir <HI>William Meredith,</HI> baronet. He suddenly veered from the <HI>Stuart</HI> to the <HI>Brunswick</HI> line; and thinking it unsafe to have a <HI>Stuart,</HI> even in canvas, presented it to my very worthy mother-in-law, <HI>Elizabeth Falconer,</HI> a true votary of exiled royalty. On her death, the choice of any of her personality having been, in the most friendly manner, offered by her son the Rev. <HI>James Falconer,</HI> D. D. I fixed on this. The period of <HI>Jacobitism</HI> was over; but I re∣member

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">ANSON.</NOTE>ANSON, the persevering ANSON, graces the lower end of the room: a head painted when he was a captain, before the year 1742, when he began his celebrated voyage. This was the bequest of my uncle <HI>James Mytton,</HI> who well knew the respect I had to the two illustrious brothers of <HI>Shugborough.</HI> Lord ANSON was for∣tunate, but his good fortune was the result of merit, not of chance. During his naval administration, and during that more arduous one under <HI>John</HI> earl of SANDWICH, the commerce of BRITAIN in every part was uninterrupted! our colonies protected! our acquisitions secured! and, in the latter war, when we had all the world to combat, our squadrons were every where! The superior genius of the man disposed our fleets so as to gain all those advantages, without neglecting, without weakening the domestic safety of BRITAIN, which must ever acknowlege his salutary strength of mind, and bury his foibles in oblivion. His blemishes were those of the private man: his high qualities, public benefits. In his active days

He was a man of considerable learning, and the finest printer of his time. <HI>Erasmus</HI> resided a long time with him, attracted by his personal merit, and his admirable skill in his profession; for to him we are indebted for the most beautiful edition of the works of his illustrious friend. <HI>Frobenius</HI> died in 1527, and was honored by the same hand with two epitaphs, one in <HI>Greek,</HI> the other in <HI>Latin.</HI></P>
<P>THE next is a small half-length on copper of Saint <HI>Charles Bor∣romeo,</HI> praying before a crucifix.<NOTE PLACE="marg">SAINT CHARLES BORROMEO.</NOTE> That illustrious prelate was an ornament to his church. He is represented in his car∣dinal's dress, with a wan and meagre countenance, the effects of his sincere austerities. Those alone ought not to have given him a place in the kalendar: his genuine piety, his benevolence, his great deeds of charity, furnished him with the fullest clame. Add to this, his courage in facing the pestilence which raged in <HI>Milan,</HI> his native city, in all its horrors. He administered to the distressed every comfort, spiritual and temporal. Like

he escaped, and received his heavenly re∣ward <HI>November</HI> 3d, 1584.</P>
<P>Or unknown portraits I have two. One is of an officer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">UNKNOWN POR∣TRAITS.</NOTE> I think by <HI>de Gelder,</HI> a pupil of <HI>Rembrandt</HI>'s. It is much in the style of his master. The figure is standing, with a good military coun∣tenance. In one hand is a long sword, the point resting on the floor; on his head is a hat and feathers; his body is armed to the waist; below are long skirts of buff; his helmet is on a barrel, the colors-furled, and rests against the wall; his shield and war-saddle near them. <HI>De Gelder</HI> was born in 1645, and died in 1727.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="33"/>THE other is of a <HI>Low Country</HI> soldier; a small full length; a most graceful figure of a young man leaning on a chair, with an emptied glass in one hand, and on the floor a flagon, and near is his white hat and feathers; his hair long; he is in a buff coat, a broad leathern belt, with a cloak flung carelessly over one arm; he has vast boots, and a long sword hanging down from his side.</P>
<P>A SMALL, but neat inside of a <HI>Flemish</HI> church; and a fine painting of a white grous, hung by one foot from a tree, with some plants near the foot. These are all the paintings I can boast of. The last is by <HI>Rysbrack,</HI> a painter born at <HI>Antwerp</HI> about the middle of the last century.</P>
<P>I MAY conclude with a very neat drawing by <HI>Moses Griffith,</HI> of the antient gardens of <HI>Llanerch,</HI> in the <HI>Italian</HI> taste of the middle of the last century, made by Mr. <HI>Mutton Davies,</HI> after his return from <HI>Italy;</HI> they were fine (in that style), decorated with water∣works, statues, dials, &amp;c. &amp;c. emitting water, to the astonishment of the spectators. The original of the drawing is from an old large picture in my possession.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">CABINET OF FOSSILS.</NOTE><HI>Downing</HI> may boast of a good and numerous collection of fossils and minerals, partly collected by myself, partly by my son in his extensive travels; many of the specimens are elegant, and most of them instructive.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">TYDDI<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> UCHA'.</NOTE>ABOVE a mile from <HI>Downing</HI> is <HI>Tyddyn Ucha',</HI> a farm-house belonging to our family. In the last century it was inhabited by my grandfather, during the life-time of his father. My uncle <HI>John Pennant,</HI> and two of my aunts, were born there. I have often heard it said, with pride, that once three baronets were
<PB N="23" REF="34"/>
entertained there by the hospitable owner. I vehemently suspect, from the size of the house, that at lest two of them must have slept together.</P>
<P>MY father has often told me a ridiculous story of the effect of a jolly evening passed there by some of the convivial neigh∣bors. They had made very free with some ale which had been brewed with malt made of soul barley, unfortunately mixed with the seeds of certain plant, which brought on a temporary blind∣ness. The guests had not gone far before the symptoms seized them, and they were led back to their host, who was in the same condition. They were suddenly alarmed with a violent scream in a female voice. It seems that the <HI>butleress,</HI> or female butler, had, in her repeated visits to the cellar, sipped too plentifully of the <HI>cwrw,</HI> and, terrified with the effect, betrayed herself by giv∣ing unguardedly full vent to her fears.</P>
<P>IN those days the neighbors were much addicted to <HI>terming,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">TERMING.</NOTE> <HI>i. e.</HI> brewing a barrel of ale at some favorite ale-house, and stay∣ing there till it was all drunk out. They never went to bed, even should the <HI>term</HI> last a week; they either slept in their chairs or on the floor, as it happened, then awoke and resumed their jollity. At length, when the barrel was exhausted, they reeled away, and the hero of this <HI>Bacchanalian</HI> rout always carried the spiggot in triumph. Coursing was very frequently the occasion of these <HI>terms;</HI> each gentleman brought his gre-hound, and often made matches, more for the glory of producing the best dog, than for the value of the bet.</P>
<P>AT half a mile distance, south of this house, stands <HI>Merton,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">MERTON ABBOT.</NOTE> in the township of <HI>Merton Uwch Glan;</HI> I gave it the addition of
<PB N="24" REF="35"/>
<HI>Abbot,</HI> to distinguish it from the many others of the same name. It was built in the year 1572, and for the time was a tolerable house. This and the <HI>Holywell</HI> estate was conveyed into our family by the marriage of <HI>David Pennat</HI> with <HI>Katherine Pennant,</HI> daughter and sole heiress of <HI>John Pennant,</HI> of <HI>Holywell,</HI> and <HI>Mary,</HI> daughter of <HI>Thomas ap Thomas ap Edward,</HI> of <HI>Merton. John</HI> was fourth in descent from <HI>Nicholas Pennant,</HI> last abbot of <HI>Basingwerk,</HI> and son of <HI>Thomas ap David,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c. his predecessor in the abbotship. <HI>David Pennant,</HI> who made this valuable acquisition, died in 1666; <HI>Katherine</HI> survived him till the year 1700. This was the only marriage that added much to our estate since the time of <HI>Madoc ap Thomas ap Meiiir,</HI> who sat down at <HI>Bychton</HI> with the heiress of <HI>Philip O' Phicdan,</HI> hereafter to be mentioned.</P>
<P>THE two <HI>Mertons, Uwch Glan</HI> and <HI>Is Glan,</HI> are adjacent town∣ships. They were, at the time of compiling the <HI>Doomsday Book,</HI> undivided, and known by the <HI>Saxon</HI> name of <HI>Meretone,</HI> or the township bordering over the <HI>sea.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">COMPLAINTS OF TEGENGL.</NOTE>THE noblemen of <HI>Tegengl</HI> drew up a memorial, which they presented to <HI>John Peckham,</HI> archbishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> containing, among numbers of other grievances, the wrong done to the men of <HI>Merton.</HI> The archbishop (whom in 1281 came down on the christian design of reconciling the differences between <HI>Edward</HI> I. and <HI>Llewelyn</HI>) seemed to pity their sufferings; but it it not pro∣bable that the king paid any attention to their representations, as he was then in full march against our gallant countrymen, de∣termined to make an effectual conquest of an enemy who gave him so much serious disturbance.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="36"/>ABOVE three hundred yards from my house,<NOTE PLACE="marg">DOWNING UCHA'.</NOTE> on the opposite side of a dingle, stands another <HI>Downing,</HI> the seat of my worthy neighbor and friend <HI>Thomas Thomas,</HI> <ABBR>esq</ABBR> His good father came into possession of it about the year 1749, by marriage with Miss <HI>Mary Lloyd,</HI> heiress of the place, and descended from <HI>Edwyn,</HI> prince or lord of <HI>Tegengl.</HI> His <HI>Llys</HI> or palace was near <HI>Northop.</HI> My much-lamented friend the Reverend <HI>John Lloyd,</HI> of <HI>Caerwys,</HI> was of opinion that the fat figure on one of the tomb-stones in <HI>Northop</HI> church, represented this chieftain.</P>

I cannot but mention a cruel revenge which the <HI>Montagues</HI> used to take on their neighbor <HI>Capulet,</HI> by the advantage of a stream which ran through their grounds in its way to our kitchen, where it was applied to the purpose of a jack for the turning of a spit.

<P>IN the footway to <HI>Bychton</HI> is the wood,<NOTE PLACE="marg">WHITEFORD WOOD.</NOTE> the <HI>Sylva</HI> mentioned in the <HI>Doomsday Book.</HI> At the time of that compilation it was
<PB N="26" REF="37"/>
valued at 20 <HI>s.</HI> only. Possibly the value did not increase greatly in the beginning of the sixteenth century, when my ancestor, <HI>Hugh Pennant</HI> of <HI>Bychton</HI> (eighteenth in descent from their common stock) married <HI>Jonet,</HI> daughter of <HI>Richard ap Howel,</HI> of <HI>Mostyn,</HI> who led his troops to <HI>Bosworth Field.</HI> Tradition says, that (money being wondrous scarce in those days) he was offered this wood as a portion with the lady; which our family rejected, as of no value in a country of forests. I cannot estimate the thousands it would have been worth at present, or in course of time.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A LLYS.</NOTE>IN this wood are the remains of some antient <HI>Llys,</HI> or palace, as my friend, the late antiquary of <HI>Cherwys,</HI> used to maintain. I can only say, that to judge of the foundations, our palaces in those days were not very splendid.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">LINE OF TUDOR TREVOR.</NOTE>THE line of <HI>Tudor Trevor,</HI> with all its branches, is so fre∣quently spoken of, that I shall here continue his descent. He was son of <HI>Y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ger ap Cadvarch,</HI> earl of <HI>Hereford,</HI> in right of his wife <HI>Rhiengar,</HI> daughter and heir of <HI>Llwdocea ap Karadoc Vreichvras,</HI> or the earl of <HI>Hereford,</HI> grandson to the said <HI>Karadoc,</HI> and great-grandson to <HI>Karadoc Vreichvras,</HI> earl of <HI>Hereford</HI> and <HI>Marchiogen,</HI> in the time of prince <HI>Arthur,</HI> and who had besides the honor of being one of the knights of the rou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ble. <HI>Tudor</HI> married <HI>Angbarad,</HI> daughter to <HI>Howel Dda,</HI> prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> renowned for his wise laws, who quitted his government and retired to <HI>Rome,</HI> and there died in 948, whose death was sore bewailed of all men,
<Q>for he was a prince that loved peace and good order, and that feared God.</Q>
I am sorry to deprive our ancestor of his title of earl: the <HI>Welsh</HI> had none such among them. Our great
<PB N="27" REF="38"/>
men had that of <HI>Arglwydd</HI> or <HI>Lord,</HI> and the chief or monarch that of <HI>T'wisog</HI> or <HI>Prince. Tudor</HI> had in right of his mother immense possessions in <HI>Herefordshire,</HI> and in all that country, then called <HI>Ferlys,</HI> which lies between the <HI>Wye</HI> and the <HI>Severn.</HI> He was also lord of <HI>Whittington,</HI> in <HI>Shropshire</HI> (See <HI>Tour in Wales,</HI> i. p. 250.) and made that castle his residence. Let me observe that many of his estates, being in the marches of <HI>Wales,</HI> he was called of the <HI>Tribe</HI> of <HI>March,</HI> to distinguish him from the other tribes.</P>
<P>THE families descended from this chieftain were exceedingly numerous, but those still existing in the male line are only the following: <HI>Thomas Trevor Hampden</HI> viscount <HI>Hampden, Richard Pennant</HI> Lord <HI>Penrhyn,</HI> Sir <HI>Roger Mostyn,</HI> and the <HI>Mostyns</HI> of <HI>Bryngwyn,</HI> of <HI>Segrwyd,</HI> branches of his family, and Sir <HI>Pyers Mostyn, Eytons</HI> of <HI>Eyton, Wynnes</HI> of <HI>Gwerninvawr, Jones's,</HI> of <HI>Llwynon,</HI> and <HI>Jeffries's,</HI> of <HI>Acton,</HI> existing in my friend the Rev. Dr. <HI>Jeffries,</HI> residentiary of <HI>St. Paul's,</HI> and worthy Rector of <HI>Whiteford,</HI> and the <HI>Pennants</HI> of <HI>Bychton.</HI></P>
<P>ADJACENT to this wood is my paternal seat,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BYCHTON.</NOTE> I may say the primaeval seat of our family. The date, on a piece of wood over an added window, is 1572. This gives an idea of the house of a gentleman of middling estate in those days. There was a much more antient date on a beam in the barn, which was inadver∣tently destroyed when I new built it. I lived at this seat in 1761 and 1762; at that time I recollect buying of the tenant, who with great civility quitted it to me, his stock of wheat at 2 <HI>s.</HI> the hobbet, consisting of two measures, of forty-one quarts each.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="39"/>LET me contrast this to a year of scarcity in our country, that of 1637, when I find, by a diary kept by a <HI>Peter Roberts,</HI> of <HI>St. Asaph,</HI> that in the same year wheat was sold at 21 <HI>s.</HI> the hobbet, rye at 15 <HI>s.</HI> and vetches at 11 <HI>s.</HI> Change this into the present value of silver, the hobbet of wheat at this time would be equal to 29 <HI>s.</HI> of barley to 20 <HI>s.</HI> 8½ <HI>d.</HI> and vetches to 15 <HI>s.</HI> 2¼<HI>d.</HI> —a calculation for which I am indebted to the ingenuity of my good assistant, the Rev.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">SUMMER-HOUSE.</NOTE>VERY near to the house stood a summer-house, (a building very frequent near the seats of <HI>Welsh</HI> gentry) with a cellar be∣neath. These were used as retreats for the jovial owners and their friends, to enjoy, remote from the fair, their toasts and noisy merriment. Mine was so near to ruin, that I was obliged to pull it down. I remember oaks of a vast size growing near to the house.

<P>THE great and decisive victory on the mountains of <HI>Carno,</HI> in the county of <HI>Montgomery,</HI> in the same year, was owing to the valor of <HI>Philip.</HI> The usurper was defeated and slain, after the bloodiest contest in our annals. <HI>Gryffydd</HI> was reinstated in his lawful dominions, and reigned with great dignity during fifty-seven years.

<P>THIS my ancestor <HI>Madoc</HI> probably lived also by the sword, for I cannot with any certainty prove that before this time he had any landed property.

<Q>the fyelde azure three flower-de-luces of the fyelde:</Q>
and such is the <HI>dictum</HI> of <HI>Robert Cooke, alias Clarentieux,</HI> ROV D'ARMES, 1580.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Mostyns</HI> of <HI>Mostyn</HI> bear as their crest, a lion rampant.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Trevors,</HI> who were the <HI>Pen-cenedl,</HI> or head of the whole line, had for their crest the wivern or dragon on a cap of dignity. The present Lord <HI>Hampden</HI> is its true <HI>Pen-cenedl;</HI> but by heraldic rules, on the descent of the <HI>Hampden</HI> estate to his lordship, from the alliance of his ancestor Sir <HI>John Trevor</HI> with the <HI>Hampdens,</HI> the talbot, the crest of that family, supersedes the antient dragon.</P>
<P>THE dragon was worn as a cogni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ance by all our princes, particularly by <HI>Cadwaledr,</HI> who died in 688. It was adopted by <HI>Henry</HI> VII. who clamed descent from him, and wore it in he battle of <HI>Bosworth.</HI> It took its origin from the legend of <HI>Uther Pen-dragon,</HI> father of king <HI>Arthur,</HI> who is said to have received
<PB N="32" REF="44"/>
the addition of <HI>Pen-dragon,</HI> from his wearing that imaginary ani∣mal on his helmet.</P>
<P>OUR bards united with the poet the office of herald. At first our pedegrees were preserved by oral communication; after∣wards committed to writing, and preserved in the houses of our great men. The heralds office is at present a great repository of these kinds of treasure.</P>
<P>BY the first we are assured of many other illustrious descents from princes' ancestors to our <HI>Tudor Trevor;</HI> from the princes of <HI>Powis;</HI> from <HI>Rywalbon Conwyn,</HI> (who, with his brother <HI>Kynric,</HI> were joint princes of <HI>North Wales;</HI>) from even <HI>Roderic</HI> the Great, and from <HI>Cadwaladr;</HI> and finally from <HI>Vortigern,</HI> the un∣fortunate king of the <HI>Britons,</HI> who fled from the rage of his subjects, for his invitation of the <HI>Saxons</HI> into <HI>Britain,</HI> and died in∣gloriously about the year 465, in the darksome <HI>Nant y Gwrtheyrn,</HI> in the county of <HI>Caernarvon</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Tour in Wales,</HI> ii. p. 204.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE <HI>English</HI> heralds attempt to add fame to our race, by telling us that the present Sir <HI>Roger Mostyn</HI> is nineteenth in de∣scent from the Conqueror, from <HI>John of Gaunt,</HI> from <HI>Richard Plantagenet,</HI> duke of <HI>York,</HI> father to <HI>Edward</HI> IV. I leave <HI>Arthur Collins,</HI> (vol. iii. p. 129, 131) to adduce the proofs. Why will my ingenious countrywoman, after admitting these honors <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>British Synonymy,</HI> i. p. 231.</NOTE>, deny to us BIRTH, by distinction fine as ether, and as imper∣ceptible, allowing us only the advantage of family! And, not∣withstanding the lady's justly-favored <HI>Johnson</HI> makes birth and lineage synonymous, yet my cousin will allow us no more of the former than what that great writer defines the
<Q>act of coming
<PB N="33" REF="45"/>
into the world,</Q>
the act which graced our country with its fair synonymist.</P>
<P>I HOPE the reader will not think me too warm, for thus vin∣dicating my clame to <HI>birth,</HI> in common with my worthy brother-in-law. I am jealous that the honors which I possess by means of our marriage with his aunt <HI>Shonet,</HI> ten ascents higher, should receive any abatement: and I trust that the lady concerned will, as a <HI>Welsh-woman,</HI> even applaud my warmth on so very interest∣ing an occasion!</P>
<P>OUR house has always been the <HI>Pen-cenedl,</HI> or chief of the name. We had several branches, all which, excepting those I have enumerated, are extinct in the male line; unless it be in the gentleman who of late years spread our celebrity in the capital, under the title of <HI>Pennant's Parcel Post.</HI></P>
<P>THE first who branched from us was the hospitable, the useful, the valiant <HI>Thomas Pennant,</HI> abbot of <HI>Basingwerk,</HI> son of <HI>David Pennant ap Tudor,</HI> before mentioned. He flourished in the reign of <HI>Edward</HI> IV. and is highly celebrated by <HI>Guttun Owain,</HI> a bard of the year 1480, who records the hospitality of the abbot, in a poem printed in the collection of Mr. <HI>Rhŷs Jones.</HI> The poet is so liberal of his praise as to say, <HI>That he gave twice the treasure of a king in wine.</HI></P>
<Q><L>Er bwrw yno aur brenhin</L>
<L>Ef a roes deufwy ar wîn.</L></Q>
<P>And among his other luxuries I think he enumerates sugar, which a rich abbot of the fifteenth century might easily indulge
<PB N="34" REF="46"/>
himself in, for it had been a great article of commerce in <HI>Sicily</HI> as early as the year 1148.</P>
<P><HI>Guttun Owain</HI> also adds:
<Q><L>Tŷ da i'r ŷd, o'r tu draw.</L>
<L>Tŷ brâg sydd, Tŷ <HI>b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ics</HI> iddaw.</L></Q>
A good granary on the other side, a malt-house, and a house of bricks: which last was probably a material in building of recent introduction in our country.</P>
<P><HI>Guttun Owain</HI> and <HI>Tudor Aled,</HI> another noted bard, speak not only of his works of utility; of the water and of the wind-mills he erected; of his having enlarged and beautified the abbey, but also compliment him on his prowess in battle. Neither is <HI>Guttun</HI> silent on a subject, pleasing to every <HI>Welsh</HI> ear, the pedegree of his patron, whom he derives from <HI>Edwyn,</HI> and from <HI>Rhŷs Sais,</HI> a direct descendant from <HI>Tudor Trevor.</HI></P>
<P>IT is probable that our abbot discovered that celibacy did not suit his constitution. He quitted his profession, and became (in the law term) a monk <HI>deraigne,</HI> and married into the great house of <HI>Peurbyn,</HI> a lady of the name of <HI>Angharad.</HI> He became the father of four children. Of them, <HI>Edward</HI> the eldest succeeded to the fortunes which he seems to have secured in the parish of <HI>Holywell. Thomas,</HI> the second son, became vicar of <HI>Holywell.</HI> And <HI>Nicholas,</HI> the third, in due time abbot of <HI>Basingwerk;</HI> he was the last, and became founder of a family, as I shall have occasion to mention. More also will be said of the line of <HI>Edward,</HI> who may be considered as the first of the house of <HI>Bagilt.</HI></P>
<P>WE did not assume the name of <HI>Pennant,</HI> till the time of <HI>David Pennant ap Tudor,</HI> fifteenth in descent from <HI>Tudor Trevor;</HI> it is a
<PB N="35" REF="47"/>
true <HI>Welsh</HI> name, taken from <HI>Pen,</HI> a head, and <HI>Nant,</HI> a dingle, our house of <HI>Bychton</HI> being seated at the head of a very consider∣able one. The name is very common in <HI>North Wales,</HI> applied to places, such as <HI>Pennant St. Melangl, Pennant Mowddwy, Pennant Lliw,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c. I have found it in <HI>Cornwal,</HI> and again in the great bay of <HI>Douarnenez,</HI> in <HI>Bretagne,</HI> where, among numbers of other <HI>Welsh</HI> names, is that of <HI>Pointe Pennant.</HI></P>
<P>IT has been delivered down to us,<NOTE PLACE="marg">GI<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>CS.</NOTE> that in some distant time a gang of gipsies used to haunt this dingle, and that eighteen of them were executed, after which the gipsey race never more fre∣quented the neighborhood. I cannot learn their crime, possibly there was none, for they might have been legally murdered by the cruel statute of the 1st and 2d of <HI>Philip</HI> and <HI>Mary,</HI> which enacts,
<Q>that if, within forty days next after proclamation of this present act shall be made, that then he or they which shall not depart and avoid within the said time of forty days, according to the true meaning of this act, shall be judged and deemed, ac∣cording to the laws of this realm of <HI>England,</HI> a felon and felons, and shall suffer therefore pains of death, loss of lands and goods as in other cases of felony, and shall be tried as is aforesaid, and without having any benefit or privilege of sanctuary or clergy.</Q>
Sir <HI>Matthew Hale</HI> tells us, that in <HI>Suffolk,</HI> a few years before the restauration, were executed, at a single assizes, not less than thirteen; but none, on that barbarous law, have suffered since that time. In these humane days the gipsies may wander in peace, provided they behave inoffensively wheresoever they chance to make their transient abode; for the bloody act was repealed in the twenty-third year of his present majesty.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="48"/><NOTE PLACE="marg">OUR FIRST M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>GE WITH AN ENGLISHWOMAN.</NOTE><HI>David Pennant</HI> was the first of us who married into a <HI>Saxon</HI> family; he took to wife <HI>Anne,</HI> daughter of <HI>John Done,</HI> of <HI>Utkin∣ton,</HI> in <HI>Cheshire,</HI> by <HI>Anne</HI> daughter of <HI>Richard Heaton,</HI> of <HI>Heaton,</HI> in the county of <HI>Lancaster.</HI> He begat many sons and daughters, among them was the famous abbot <HI>Thomas,</HI> and also Sir <HI>Hugh Pennant, Offeiriad,</HI> or priest, whom the great <HI>Lhuyd,</HI> in his <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aelogic,</HI> p. 257, calls an able poet, in the time of <HI>Henry</HI> VIII.; and I find also, that in 1575 he was at an <HI>Fisteddfod,</HI> at <HI>Caerwis,</HI> secondary student in vocal song, and — he was the only musical man in all our line.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">OUR FIRST SHE∣RIFF.</NOTE>TILL the advancement of <HI>Richard Pennant</HI> to the title of <HI>Penrbyn,</HI> our house was never distinguished by any honors beyond the most useful one, that of justice of the peace. I should blush if a <HI>Pennant</HI> should be found, who through lack of public spirit, sloth, or selfishnese, could decline that great constitutional office! The first sheriff of our house was <HI>Pyers Pennant,</HI> who discharged that trust in 1612. He had the lot of marrying the daughter of a family not famed for placidity, or the milder virtues. <HI>Valdè valde, irritabile genus!</HI> 'And from them, <HI>Tom</HI> (a most worthy aunt of mine used often to tell me) we got our passion;'—and frequently added the wise <HI>Welsh</HI> caution, <HI>Beware of a Breed!</HI></P>
<P>THE fruits of this marriage appeared very soon. <HI>Thomas,</HI> the eldest son, in a <HI>furor brevis,</HI> killed his miller: was indicted for the manslaughter, tried, and convicted; but received his pardon, dated in the first of <HI>Charles</HI> I. or the year 1625. This grace preserved him from the ignominious part of the sentence, and the more important advantage of preserving his personality, which would otherwise have been forfeited to the crown.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="49"/>THIS is sufficient to shew that the offence did admit of every palliation; but a stronger proof than that may be drawn from the following honor having been conferred on him, when we find that in eight years afterwards, in 1633, he was intrusted with the care of the county of <HI>Flint,</HI> by having the office of high sheriff committed to his charge. He died the next year; <HI>cujus animae propitietur</HI> DEUS! This unfortunate man married a grand-daughter of that nuptial-loving dame <HI>Catherine y Berran</HI> (See <HI>Tour in Wales,</HI> vol. ii. p. 29) <HI>Mary,</HI> daughter of <HI>Edward Wynn,</HI> of <HI>Ystrad,</HI> son of <HI>Morris Wynn,</HI> of <HI>Gwydir,</HI> fourth and last husband of our famous <HI>Catherine.</HI> There was no issue from this match; so <HI>Bychton</HI> descended to <HI>David,</HI> the next brother.</P>
<P>IN those days, and long preceding,<NOTE PLACE="marg">PRESENTS TO SHERIFFS.</NOTE> it was customary for the friends and neighbors of the sheriff to make presents to him to assist in defraying the expences. I have among my papers two long rolls of gifts. To give the whole would be very tedious. I extract only a few of the most remarkable, among which are several in money, which his friends were not ashamed to offer: nor the sheriff to receive. The cash received in 1612, was £. 10. 18 <HI>s.</HI> 6 <HI>d.;</HI> that in 1642, £. 5.</P>

<Q>to be in a late communication, where a gentleman spoke of a hideous thing that happened in <HI>High Holborn;</HI> how one <HI>John Pennant,</HI> a young man of 21, being dissected after his death, there was a kind of serpent, with divers tails, found in the left ventricle of his heart, which you know is the most defended part, being thrice thicker than the right, and is the cell which holds the purest and most illustrious liquor, the arterial blood and the vital spirits. The serpent was it seems three years ingen∣dring, for so long time he found himself indisposed in the breast; and it was observed that his eye, in the interim, grew more sharp and fiery, like the eye of a cock, which is next the serpent's eye in redness: so that the symptom of his in∣ward disease might have been told by certain exterior rays and signatures.</Q></P>
<P><Q>GOD preserve us from public calamities! for serpentine monsters have been often ill favored presages. I remember in the <HI>Roman</HI> story, to have read how, when snakes or serpents were found near the statues of their Gods, at one time about <HI>Jupiter</HI>'s neck, another time about <HI>Minerva</HI>'s thigh, there fol∣lowed bloody civil wars after it.</Q></P>
<P>THIS portentous story is given most scientifically by Dr. <HI>Edward May,</HI> in a thin quarto pamphlet of forty pages. The

<P>THE epistle dedicatory is
<Q>to the renowned peere of this king∣dom, <HI>Edward</HI> earle of <HI>Dorset,</HI></Q>
the book itself to Sir <HI>Theodore Maiherne,</HI> knight. In that he lays before him the wonderful case. He tells us that he was sent on <HI>October</HI> 7th, 1637, by Lady
<PB N="48" REF="60"/>
<HI>Herris,</HI> wife to Sir <HI>Francis Herris,</HI> knight, to dissect her nephew <HI>John Pennant,</HI> who had deceased the night before, to know the cause of his death. The doctor brought with him Master <HI>Jacob Heyden,</HI> surgeon, to assist in the enquiry. Mr. <HI>Heydon</HI> made in∣cision into the left ventricle of the heart, which was full of blood. On thorough examination, the monster was discovered, the head of which was so like to that of a serpent, that Lady <HI>Herris</HI> shivered to see it. To judge by the prints, all the upper part of it was cylindrical; towards the lower part bifurcated, and each fork divided into five long and slender fibrillae. I leave to the reader the perusal of the rest of Dr <HI>May</HI>'s most curious dis∣quisition.</P>
<P>THIS is not the only instance of similar appearances in the heart: but we hear no more of serpents; the name was changed to <HI>polypuses,</HI> to which, for their numerous ramifications, they might bear the resemblance. In our Philosophical Transactions are more than one paper on the subject. In Mr. <HI>Lowthorp</HI>'s Abridg. iii. p. 70, and tab. p. 120, is an account, and the figure of one found in the heart of a man at <HI>Oxford;</HI> and in Mr. <HI>Martyn</HI>'s Abridg. ix. p. 135, is the account of several discovered in num∣bers of sailors who died immediately on their return from the <HI>West Indies.</HI> This paper was written by the celebrated Dr. <HI>Huxbam;</HI> he quotes <HI>Malpighius, Bartholinus, Tulpius,</HI> and <HI>Pechlin,</HI> as giving incontestible instances of the existence of polypi in the heart, in the strictest sense. This opinion is now exploded. The only uncommon circumstance (my ingenious friend Dr. <HI>Haygarth</HI> assures me) is, that the left ventricle of the heart, and probably the <HI>aorta,</HI> which after death are usually empty, were
<PB N="49" REF="61"/>
in these cases full of blood. The <HI>crassamentum,</HI> upon coagula∣tion, had taken the form of the arteries in which it was con∣tained.</P>
<P>I BREAK a little into chronology,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BARBAROUS EVENTS.</NOTE> to conclude with an event relative to another of my house; of little moment indeed, but merely to give a picture of the barbarous days, even of the be∣ginning of the last century, which I collected from the journal kept by <HI>Peter Roberts,</HI> of <HI>St. Asaph,</HI> before mentioned. He re∣cords, that on <HI>July</HI> 22d, 1615, <HI>Hugh Pennant,</HI> brother to <HI>Pyers Pennant,</HI> <ABBR>esq</ABBR> of <HI>Bychton,</HI> died of a broken head given him at <HI>Denbigh,</HI> by <HI>Pyers Hughes:</HI> That in the year 1626, <HI>Rowland Evan,</HI> a vicar of <HI>St. Asaph,</HI> was killed at an ale-house in <HI>Llandrillo Eiderneon:</HI> That on <HI>October</HI> 3d, 1628, Mr. <HI>Richard Thelwal</HI> was slain at his own house at <HI>Ruthen:</HI> And that, in 1634, one <HI>Foulkes,</HI> of <HI>Cilowen,</HI> killed his wife, and cut his own throat.</P>
<P>THE mention of ale house tempts me to speak of a house of mine, by the sea-side, in the township of <HI>Bychton,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">LLETTY GONEST.</NOTE> called <HI>Lletty Gonest,</HI> or the <HI>honest house.</HI> It had been formerly in the highest repute for its excellent ale, brewed by a good ale-wife yclep'd <HI>Jane,</HI> of <HI>Lletty,</HI> whom I well remember. She acquired both fame and wealth, both of which I may say she bequeathed to her descendants; who to this day, by their own industry, continue to flourish on the effect of her's.</P>
<P>THE house was originally built by one <HI>Smith,</HI> from <HI>Worcester,</HI> partly for the purposes of distilling, and partly for a warehouse. I am told, that it occasionally had served for the place of con∣finement for impressed men, at the time in which the colliers
<PB N="50" REF="62"/>
had such great trade with <HI>Dublin.</HI> The strong bars in the lower windows favor that notion.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">SINGULAR HEAD.</NOTE>ABOVE the door is a very singular sculpture, cut in bas-relief, in stone, and let into the wall. One part is a strange chimerical figure of a monster with four legs, and the head of an owl, fixing its claws in the side of a human head. The face is averted, and expressing much agony. The eye-lids are drawn up, the eyes the same, the mouth half opened, and the teeth closely fixed together. The face is young, but has a pair of whiskers, and is far from being ill cut. It has the character of one of <HI>Le Brun</HI>'s passions, article <HI>Pain.</HI> It evidently never was designed for this place, but seems originally to have been one of those fanciful <HI>gothic</HI> sculptures be∣longing to some antient church.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">SMUGGLING.</NOTE>IN the reign of King <HI>William,</HI> this house was remarkable for the violent hands laid on a vast seizure of <HI>French</HI> wines, to the amount of sixty pipes, which had been smuggled into the great barn at <HI>Trelacre,</HI> in the parish of <HI>Llanasa,</HI> destined for the use of the <HI>Welsh</HI> gentry in this and the neighboring counties. It must be observed, that in those days port-wine was in very little use in our country. The officers had conveyed this prize with safety as far as <HI>Lletty Gonest,</HI> where they intended to sleep that night. At midnight they were alarmed by the entry of multitudes of colliers, who tied every body in the house neck and heels. They removed the wine into other carriages, and conveyed it into places so secure that it never more could be heard of. Many of the colliers were observed to have rings on their fingers, and fine linen. In fact numbers of them were the gentlemen interested in the wine, and concerned in the re-capture, who mixed with
<PB N="51" REF="63"/>
the colliers, to direct them in their operations. A proclamation was issued out for the discovery of the offenders; but such was the fidelity of our people, that they were never detected. The poor tapster, in particular, knew perfectly well who they were, and large rewards were offered to him by the custom-house; but nothing could shake his attachment to his friends. He lived long after, supported by the grateful contributions of the neighboring 'squires.</P>
<P>HIGH above <HI>Lletty Gonest</HI> stands a summer-house, built by my grandfather, to which he often adjourned with his guests, to re∣gale them with the delicious beer, brewed by the famous <HI>Jane.</HI> Many years after, when I became master of the estate, I also had my adjournment, but it was either to eat shrimps or to drink tea. An honest vicar of a distant parish, who had been a most intimate friend of my convivial grandfather, enquired whether I ever went to the summer-house; and was answered, 'Now and then, to drink tea.' Struck with horror at the de∣generacy of the grandson, the good man with indignation ex∣clamed,
<Q>DRINK TEA! his grandfather would have SCORNED IT!</Q></P>
<P>THE turnpike road designed for the enabling the smelters and others to convey our coal to the places of its destination, from the <HI>Mostyn</HI> and <HI>Bychton</HI> pits, passes by <HI>Lletty Gonest,</HI> and goes along the shore towards <HI>Holywell.</HI> In the space of a mile it passes by three smelting-houses, <HI>Shop-goch,</HI> the property of Sir <HI>Roger Mostyn,</HI> and <HI>Pen-y-Ro</HI> and <HI>Llanerch-y-môr,</HI> belonging to me. The last disputes antiquity with most in the county, the late works at <HI>Gadlis</HI> excepted.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="64"/>ABOVE the last is the neat house of <HI>Kinsale,</HI> inhabited by my good friend and tenant Mr. <HI>Ralph Richardson,</HI> who for several years had with great success and integrity carried on the smelting business, with the advantage of shipping the produce from the very spot, after a short carriage to the vessels.</P>
<P>A SMALL marsh begins a little beyond <HI>Lletty Gonest,</HI> and widens as it extends southward. It borders on the manor of <HI>Mostyn:</HI> but itself owns no lord but the king. The same may be said of the va∣luable remainder, as far as the manor of <HI>Coleshill,</HI> in the parish of <HI>Flint.</HI> The minor of <HI>Greenfield,</HI> in the parish of <HI>Holywell,</HI> was long supposed to have been the property of one or other of two clamants, who fell into dispute about the right. The matter was referred to two gentlemen of the law, eminent for their abilities, and not less so for their probity. After examining all the proofs adduced by the rivals, they adjudged that neither had any clame to the lordship; so it is now left to the freeholders under our sovereign lord the king: a rich tract for future inclosures.</P>
<P>A LITTLE beyond <HI>Kinsale</HI> is the end of our parish on this side. The boundary between it and the parish of <HI>Holywell,</HI> is a small <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll called <HI>Avon Marsh Siambr.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">AVON MARSH SIAMBR.</NOTE> Above on an eminence is the old seat of the <HI>Pierces,</HI> a family now extinct, and the property passed into other hands. It bears the name of <HI>Is Glan,</HI> from the name of the township in which it stands.</P>
<P>ABOUT a mile higher up is <HI>Merton,</HI> the seat of the Reverend Mr. <HI>John Foulkes.</HI> He derives his right to it from <HI>Margaret,</HI> daughter and heiress to <HI>Thomas Parry ap William Parry Wynne.</HI> She married <HI>John Foulkes,</HI> of <HI>Pen-yeba <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>luy,</HI> in the parish of <HI>Shy<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iog,</HI> great-grandfather to the present owner, who died in <HI>July,</HI> 1667, and was interred in <HI>Whiteford</HI> church-yard.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="65"/><HI>Tre Mostyn</HI> bounds <HI>Tre Bychton</HI> on the west.<NOTE PLACE="marg">TRE MOSTYN.</NOTE> This town∣ship is considered as containing one fourth of the parish. It reaches to the sea-side: on which, as well as the whole, trees of every kind grow most admirably.</P>
<P>IT is divided from <HI>Tre Bychton,</HI> in the lower part by the turn∣pike road, which extends from the sea-side to <HI>Henllan,</HI> sixteen miles distant, originally designed for the conveyance of coal from the pits of this township, and that of <HI>Tre Bychton,</HI> to the great lime-works near <HI>Denbigh.</HI> The first act was obtained in 1768, the second in 1770: before which our roads were scarcely passable. If either Sir <HI>Roger Mostyn</HI>'s family or our own wanted to get to <HI>Chester,</HI> we were to reach the sea-side; then to <HI>Flint</HI> as we could, and from thence at low water cross the ford of the <HI>Dee,</HI> a way not always unattended with danger.</P>
<P>OPPOSITE to <HI>Mostyn</HI> gates, on this part of the turnpike road,<NOTE PLACE="marg">THE RHEWL.</NOTE> is a hamlet, called the <HI>Rhewl, yr Heol, platea,</HI> a way or street. On each side are a few houses. The <HI>Swan,</HI> a small ale-house, my property, was noted for its vast trade about the beginning of this century, when the coal trade was in the height of its prosperity:
<Q>And <HI>Cw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w da</HI> then unexcised by kings!</Q>
<HI>Thomas Edwards,</HI> who several years was tenant there, edu∣cated a family of numbers of children, at no inconsiderable expence, and is supposed to have acquired by the tap at lest fifteen hundred pounds.</P>
<P>FROM the <HI>Rhewl</HI> opens the principal gates to <HI>Mostyn</HI> Hall,<NOTE PLACE="marg">MOSTYN HALL.</NOTE> or more properly <HI>Moston</HI> Hall, for such, for many ages, was the spelling of the names of both the mansion and its antient owners. On this approach is a most venerable avenue, which goes for a
<PB N="54" REF="66"/>
considerable way in a direct line; then turns short, and terminates with a view of the old part of the old mansion. The park is small, but beautifully broken, and cloathed in various parts with fine oaks, and most magnificent beeches; but amidst the trees is suffered to remain rugged with the vestiges of the antient col∣lieries. The ground slopes finely to the sea, facing the North East. The trees grow with vigor close to the water, unhurt by the rude winds with which they are affailed.</P>
<P>THE house is placed about half a mile from the shore. I find some difficulty in making a description. I shall therefore refer the reader to the first plate of <HI>Welsh</HI> seats, by Mr. <HI>Boydel,</HI> and to my own, as the only method of giving him some idea of the sin∣gularity of the structure. That plate attempts the front—
<Q><L>If front it might be call'd, that shape had none</L>
<L>Distinguishable.</L></Q>
For it consists of the most antient hall; a lesser, designed for a sort of <HI>symposium</HI> for servants; and on the outside, annexed and jutting out, is the <HI>quondam</HI> chapel, now converted into a bed-chamber. I have a sketch of the whole as it was in the year 1684, made by a Mr. <HI>Thomas Dinely,</HI> an attendant on <HI>Henry,</HI> first duke of <HI>Beaufort,</HI> then lord president of the council in the prin∣cipality of <HI>Wales,</HI> and lord lieutenant of the twelve counties; who in that year made a reviewing progress of the militia of <HI>North Wales,</HI> and of course paid his respects to the great man of our country.</P>
<P>THE porch had been rebuilt in 1623. It has on it the arms of the four great alliances of the family, rudely cut on the stone.

They seem to have been copied from the great chimney-piece in the hall.</P>
<P>I CANNOT trace the time of building of this part of the house. It must have been at lest early in the time of <HI>Henry</HI> VI. but pro∣bably more antient, for in <HI>Bolton</HI> Hall, in <HI>Bowland, Yorkshire</HI> (the most antique seat we know) is a hall in a lesser scale indeed, but greatly similar; and in that house it is well known that the unfor∣tunate prince concealed himself for a long time. Posterity may find the account in my
<Q>Tour in Part of the <HI>Mercian</HI> and <HI>Northum∣brian</HI> Kingdoms.</Q>
The great gloomy hall is furnished with a <HI>Dais</HI> or elevated upper end,<NOTE PLACE="marg">THE OLD HALL.</NOTE> and with a long table for the lord and his jovial companions; and another in the side, the seat of the inferior partakers of the good cheer. To this day the similitude of the old times is kept up when the family is at home. The head servants take their dinner at the <HI>Dais,</HI> and the numerous inferior servants fill the long table. The roof is lofty, crossed with long beams. The <HI>nen-bren,</HI> or top-beam, was in all times a frequent toast, whenever the master of the house's health was drank; and '<HI>Jached y nen-bren y ty,</HI>' was the cordial phrase. The chimney-piece is magnificently plain, unless where the arms of the house and its alliances are cut on the stone, and properly emblazoned.</P>
<P>THE first are the arms (a lion rampant, ermin,<NOTE PLACE="marg">COATS OF ARMS.</NOTE> erminé) of <HI>Jevan Vychan,</HI> of <HI>Pengwern,</HI> near <HI>Llangollen,</HI> (see <HI>Tour in Wales,</HI> vol. i. p. 295.) sixteenth in descent from <HI>Owen Tudor.</HI> By the marriage of <HI>Jevan</HI> with <HI>Angharad,</HI> daughter and sole heiress of <HI>Howel ap Tudor ap Ithel Vychan,</HI> of <HI>Mostyn,</HI> he added that estate to his paternal acres in the reign of <HI>Richard</HI> II.</P>
<P>IT seems (from the <HI>Mostyn</HI> pedegree) that in 1444 <HI>Jevan</HI> had
<PB N="56" REF="69"/>
farmed the estate. He wisely determined to turn the lease into a perpetuity: and gaining the lady's affections,

<P>THE next are the arms of his spouse, the heiress of <HI>Mostyn:</HI> di∣rectly descended from the <HI>Edwyn</HI> lord of <HI>Tegengle</HI> before mentioned (argent a cross engrailed sable, between four <HI>Cornish</HI> choughs.)</P>
<P>THE third are the arms of <HI>Gloddaeth,</HI> (gules a chevron argent between three plates) acquired by the marriage of <HI>Howel ap Evan Vychan,</HI> son of the former, in 1460, with <HI>Margaret,</HI> daughter and heir of <HI>Gryffydd ap Rhys ap Gryffydd ap Madoc Gloddaeth ap Ma∣doc ap Jerweth Goch,</HI> of <HI>Cryddyn,</HI> the hundred in which the house stands.</P>
<P>THE fourth are the arms of Sir <HI>Gryffydd Lloyd. Morfydd,</HI> one of his daughters and co-heiresses, married <HI>Madoc Gloddaeth,</HI> who with her received <HI>Tregarnedd,</HI> in the isle of <HI>Anglesey,</HI> as her portion. That estate followed the succession of the house, till <HI>Gloddaeth</HI> was united with that of <HI>Mostyn,</HI> in which it continued till the year 1750; then it was alienated by the late Sir <HI>Thomas Mostyn,</HI> to the late Mr. <HI>Owen Williams,</HI> of <HI>Anglesey.</HI></P>
<P>THE walls are furnished in a suitable manner with antient mili∣tia guns, swords, and pikes; with helmets and breast-plates; with funeral atchievements,<NOTE PLACE="marg">FALCON VAST FLIGHT OF ONE.</NOTE> and with variety of spoils of the chace. A falcon is nailed against the upper end of the room, with two bells, a greater and a lesser, hung to each foot. On two silver rings are inscribed the name of the owner, Mr. <HI>Kinloch,</HI> of <HI>Kul∣rie,</HI> in the county of <HI>Angus,</HI> on the Eastern side of <HI>Scotland.</HI> With these incumbrances it flew from its owner on the morning of the 24th of <HI>September,</HI> 1772, and was killed near this house on the
<PB N="57" REF="70"/>
morning of the 26th. The precise time it reached our country is not known; therefore we are uncertain whether this bird exceeded in swiftness the hawk which flew thirty miles in an hour in pur∣suit of a woodcock; or that which made a flight out of <HI>West∣phalia</HI> into <HI>Prussia</HI> in a day—instances recorded by the learned Sir <HI>Thomas Brown.</HI></P>
<P>THE adjacent kitchen is overlooked by a gallery leading to the antient apartments of the lady of the house,<NOTE PLACE="marg">KITCHEN.</NOTE> at a period when the odors of the pot and spit were thought no ill savors. From the commanding height of the gallery the good lady might give her orders to her <HI>Coges,</HI> or she-cook, as <HI>Syrus</HI> is humorously de∣scribed by <HI>Terence</HI> to do to his scullion <HI>Dromo:</HI>—
<Q>Let the great eel sport a little longer in the water.—See that you gut the other fishes, and stew the great carp well.—Freshen the salt fish.— Look to the baked meats, good <HI>Douse.</HI>—Crisp the pig nicely.— Pray do not over-roast the surloin again.—Boil the pudding sufficiently, and do not spare plums and suet.—Be sure not to smoke the flummery.—Remember, no onions to-day—neigh∣bor <HI>P.</HI> dines with us, &amp;c. &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>IN the roof to this gallery are numbers of small roosting-holes, to which the inferior maidens of the family nightly repair to rest from their labors.</P>
<P>AT one end of the gallery is a great room,<NOTE PLACE="marg">GREAT ROOM.</NOTE> remarkable for a singular event. During the time that <HI>Henry</HI> earl of <HI>Richmond</HI> was secretly laying the foundation of the overthrow of the house of <HI>York,</HI> he passed concealed from place to place, in order to form an interest among the <HI>Welsh,</HI> who favored his cause on account of their re∣spect to his grandfather <HI>Owen Tudor,</HI> their countryman. While
<PB N="58" REF="71"/>
he was at <HI>Mostyn,</HI> a party attached to <HI>Richard</HI> III. arrived there to apprehend him. He was then about to dine, but had just time to leap out of a back window, and make his escape through a hole, which,<NOTE PLACE="marg">HENRY VII.</NOTE> to this day, is called the King's. <HI>Richard ap Howel,</HI> then lord of <HI>Mostyn,</HI> joined <HI>Henry</HI> at the battle of <HI>Bosworth;</HI> and after the victory, received from the king, in token of gratitude for his preservation, the belt and sword he wore on that day; he also pressed <HI>Richard</HI> greatly to follow him to court: but he nobly an∣swered, like the <HI>Shunamitish</HI> woman:
<Q>I dwell among mine own people.</Q>
The sword and belt were preserved in the house till within these few years. It is observable that none of our histo∣rians account for a certain period of <HI>Henry</HI>'s life, previous to his accession. It is very evident that he passed the times when he disappeared from <HI>Bretagny,</HI> in <HI>Wales.</HI> Many cotemporary bards, by feigned names, record this part of his life, under those of the LION, the EAGLE, and the like, which were to restore the em∣pire to the <HI>Britons:</HI> for the inspired favorers of the house of <HI>Lancaster</HI> did not dare to deliver their verses in other than terms allegorical, for fear of the reigning prince.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">SQUARE TOWER.</NOTE>IN all probability the original of <HI>Mostyn</HI> was a square tower, such as may be exemplified entire at <HI>Tower,</HI> the seat of the Reverend the late Dr. <HI>Wynne</HI> (see <HI>Tour in Wales,</HI> ii. p. 427). Part of that at <HI>Mostyn</HI> is still remaining, but concealed by the additional buildings. It is fully shewn in the view of <HI>Mostyn,</HI> as it was in the year 1684. The upper part ought to have been em∣battled, but the top had been in later times covered with an auk∣ward dome. These square towers are still very frequent on the borders of <HI>Scotland,</HI> built in savage times, as I have attempted to

describe in my <HI>Tour in Scotland,</HI> second edition, volume ii. p. 88. In the plate of <HI>Mostyn</HI> is given the view of the seat of a gentle∣man of large fortune in antient times. In that of <HI>Bychton,</HI> one of middling fortune. In that of the late Mr. <HI>Parry</HI>'s of <HI>Merton,</HI> one of small fortune. As to our estate, I think the rent-roll in the year 1572 might amount to about 300<HI>l.</HI> a year, consisting of a little money, and rents in kind, and services.</P>
<P>BEFORE I quit the old house, let me say, that the best view of the <HI>chaotic</HI> additions backward is from the garden, from a very handsome summer-house, built by the first baronet, as appears by his arms quartered with those of his wife, <HI>Bulkeley</HI> of <HI>Baron Hill.</HI> From this spot is seen great part of the buildings, and the appurtenances to the old house, one tacked to the other, as the increase or the wants of the family made necessary.</P>
<P>IN the year 1631, Sir <HI>Roger Mostyn,</HI> knight,<NOTE PLACE="marg">NEW HOUSE, 1631.</NOTE> gave to the house a very handsome addition; a square mass, consisting of six bed-chambers, a very large eating-room, and a dining-room or drawing-room above, with a large bow-window in the middle of each. In that below are the arms of <HI>Gwynne</HI> and <HI>D'Arcy,</HI> well emblazoned on glass. These are complimentary to two great alliances; the one of Sir <HI>Roger</HI> himself with <HI>Mary,</HI> daughter of the famous Sir <HI>John Wynne,</HI> of <HI>Gwydir;</HI> the other out of respect to the alliance with <HI>Bridget Savage,</HI> daughter of <HI>D'Arcie Savage,</HI> <ABBR>esq</ABBR> of <HI>Leighton,</HI> in <HI>Cheshire,</HI> by whom the family acquired the great estates they possess in that county. From the principal gate of the park they have the pleasing view of those of <HI>Beeston,</HI> and those above <HI>Parkgate.</HI></P>
<P>OPPOSITE to this window is a fire-place suitable to the room. Above are the arms of the numerous alliances of the house,
<PB N="60" REF="74"/>
beautifully done in stucco, dated 1632. Conjoined with them are the arms of <HI>Mary Wynne,</HI> wife of Sir <HI>Roger.</HI> Those of <HI>Gwydir</HI> quarterly with those of <HI>Gryffydd ap Conan.</HI> In the first of the <HI>Mostyn</HI> side are those of <HI>Tudor Trevor,</HI> the stock of the house. The next are those of <HI>Llwdocca ap Carad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>c.</HI> 3dly, the arms of <HI>Elidir ap Rhys Sais.</HI> 4thly, those of <HI>Jestyn ap Gurgant.</HI> 5thly, the bearing of <HI>Brochwel Yscythrog.</HI> 6thly, the arms of <HI>Edwyn.</HI> 7thly, those of <HI>Tudor ap Gronw.</HI> 8thly, of <HI>Ithel Vychan.</HI> 9thly, are the arms of <HI>Madoc Gloddaeth.</HI> 10thly, are those of Sir <HI>Gryffydd Lloyd.</HI> The 11th, of <HI>Goodman;</HI> and 12thly, and lastly, the arms of <HI>Shalmes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orow,</HI> which seem an appurtenance only to those of <HI>Goodman.</HI> This is a mere focal ornament, an abridge∣ment of the thirty-two coats which graced the pedegree of the house in the year 1663. Two <HI>Termini</HI> support the entablature of this genealogical table. The other ornaments are elegant; but unfortunately, as if to dash the mirth of the company, the architect has added, in full view, the monumental cross-bones and bared skull.</P>
<P>AT the upper end of the room are two fine portraits by <HI>Mytens,</HI> full lengths. One is of Sir <HI>Roger Mostyn,</HI> knight, men∣tioned at p. 17. His face is an excellent representation of the <HI>viridis senectus,</HI> his countenance florid, his peaked beard of strong whiteness. On his head is a black close cap, turned up with <HI>Flanders</HI> lace; round his neck a flat large ruff; his whole dress besides is black; round the waistband of his great breeches is a girdle stuck with points. This piece of magnificence gave rise to a very coarse proverb, applicable to inferior people, ambitious of acting beyond their station. Round his knees are similar gir∣dles.
<PB REF="75"/>

<PB N="61" REF="76"/>
His boots are large, and of white leather, turned down at top, and ornamented in the same finical manner as the cap: such was the foppery of the times, even in so manly a figure as was our knight of <HI>Mostyn.</HI> But then he was in full dress, his spurs of fine gold, with vast spur-leathers. His right hand rests on his stick, his left on a table covered with a carpet most ad∣mirably painted; on it his hat, broad-brimmed, and with a most immoderate crown. The date on his portrait is 1634; his age 67. He died on <HI>August</HI> 18th, 1642, and was interred at <HI>Whiteford,</HI> on <HI>September</HI> the 1st.</P>
<P>HIS lady's neck (in a picture of the same date) is ornamented with a large ruff, single and elevated; her right hand has in it a fan, and rests on an elbow-chair; on a finger of her left hand is a ring, tied to her arm by several black strings.</P>
<P>SHE is dressed in a handsome long gown, with a sash up to her very arms, exactly like the no-waisted fair of the present days. Her shape is contrived to have some degree of elegance, notwithstanding she seems to have been a large woman. I wish our modern <HI>embonpoints</HI> resembled this lady. They seem to emu∣late in fashion the form of a sack of wool, bulging out on every side, undulating their plump graces, here and there, as motion gives occasion. Over the mouth of the sack seems to have been oftimes flung by accident a light horseman's cap, or any other incongruity, instead of the venerable <HI>coeffure</HI> of the Lady <HI>Mostyn,</HI> at the sober age of forty-nine.</P>
<P>HIS son <HI>Roger,</HI> the first baronet, created <HI>August</HI> 3d, 1660,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SIR ROGER, FIRST BARONET.</NOTE> is the middle figure of a picture of the most ridiculous composition. This distinguished character is represented a kit-kat length, in a strange long flaxen wig, a breast-plate, buff skirts, and antique
<PB N="62" REF="77"/>
<HI>Roman</HI> sleeves; a negro holding his helmet. By him is his second lady, <HI>Mary,</HI> eldest daughter of <HI>Thomas,</HI> lord <HI>Bulkeley,</HI> of <HI>Baron Hill.</HI> She is reading, with one hand on a skull, and her little lap-dog placed by her warlike husband. His third wife is doubled up, and concealed behind the frame. This lady shewed such a mercenary disposition, and so mischievous to the children of her predecessor, that one of the family affixed this stigma. I have taken a peep at her, and may pronounce her countenance to be truly symptomatic of her interior.</P>
<P>SIR <HI>Roger</HI> was a zealous loyalist. He raised a regiment in support of the crown, consisting of fifteen hundred men, in twelve hours time, mostly colliers. <HI>Whitelock,</HI> whose sister had been married to Sir <HI>Thomas Mostyn,</HI> of <HI>Kilken,</HI> in this county, knight, father to Sir <HI>Roger,</HI> speaks of him in the following terms; notwithstanding their principles, and the parts they took were widely different. 'Then the parliament forces (in 1643)' says the historian, at p. 78,
<Q>took in <HI>Mostyn-house,</HI> belonging to colonel <HI>Mostyn,</HI> the governor of <HI>Flint;</HI> and in <HI>Mostyn</HI> they took four pieces of ordnance and some arms.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THIS colonel <HI>Mostyn</HI> is my sister's son, a gentleman of good parts, and mettle; of a very ancient family, large possessions, and great interest in that country; so that in twelve hours he raised 1,500 men for the king, and was well beloved there, living very nobly.</Q></P>
<P>THIS gentleman's loyalty cost him and the family dear. He spent about sixty thousand pounds in the service of his majesty. His house of <HI>Mostyn</HI> was plundered and stripped, so that he was obliged to retire to a small house called <HI>Plas-ycha,</HI> about a mile distant from <HI>Mostyn.</HI> The first was built by his grandfather, the
<PB N="63" REF="78"/>
old baronet before mentioned: within, in coarse stucco, are his arms, with those of <HI>Gwydir,</HI> and the date and initials of his and his lady's name—'1603, <HI>R. M. M. M.</HI>'</P>
<P>SIR <HI>Roger</HI> had a great intimacy with <HI>Pyers Pennant,</HI> his cotem∣porary neighbor at <HI>Bychton.</HI> Both seem to have been boon companions, as is evident from the <HI>P. S.</HI> to the following cu∣rious epistle:

<P>AT this time money was so scarce, that 4<HI>l.</HI> was a price for a pair of oxen; and the baronet of <HI>Mostyn</HI> was thought very liberal in sending his heir apparent to the university with 20<HI>l.</HI> in his pocket.</P>
<P>THE other portraits are a head of Sir <HI>Thomas Mostyn,</HI> the gen∣tleman who married <HI>Bridget Savage,</HI> heiress of the <HI>Cheshire</HI> estates.</P>

His sayings and his pranks are to this day much talked of. His is a half-length, with a pipe in his hand. His look savors not of folly, and is full of sly gravity. The portrait is well painted, I imagine in the beginning of the present century, in which <HI>Billy</HI> flourished.</P>
<P>TWO very good portraits, half-lengths, close the list. They are said to have been two painters, who sate for their pictures to each other. Their countenances are good, their dresses similar.</P>
<P>BETWEEN them is a head of <HI>Charles</HI> II. in his usual black wig. He is well painted, but without flattery. His coarse features well vindicate the question he put to poor <HI>Riley,</HI> the painter, on seeing the portrait done by that artist:

Both have a fillet round the head. Neither of these are determined. One is conjectured to have been <HI>Hesiod;</HI> the other <HI>Hippocrates.</HI></P>
<P>THIS room is in length thirty-five feet three inches; in breadth twenty feet, from the hollow of the bow-window to the fire-place.</P>
<P>IN passing out of this apartment to the great stairs is the entrance into a small and darksome room, mentioned only for the sake of a picture of a hound bitch, most enormously fat, doing great credit to the house: as another, I am in possession of, did to that of <HI>Bychton.</HI></P>
<P>THE dining-room is above the parlor.<NOTE PLACE="marg">DINING-ROOM.</NOTE> The dimensions are very singular, exceeding in breadth those of the room below about nine inches. On an antient table, made out of one plank (of some unknown wood) seven feet ten inches in length, and four feet ten in breadth, stands a most exquisite bust of the elder <HI>Brutus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">BUST OF THE ELDER BRUTUS;</NOTE> which seems as if formed in the instant that the love of his country got the better of paternal affection; when with a steady voice he was delivering to the lictors his <HI>Titus</HI> and <HI>Tiberius,</HI> to receive the reward of their treasons.</P>
<P>ON a glass case are two busts in brown alabaster,<NOTE PLACE="marg">OF TWO FAUNS.</NOTE> of a male and female <HI>Faun,</HI> with the <HI>flammeum</HI> on their heads. Both are of hideous deformity, but well executed. In the case beneath is a very fine model of a man of war of sixty-four guns:<NOTE PLACE="marg">MODEL OF A MAN OF WAR.</NOTE> and beneath that a most splendid barge. I should have mentioned, that, between the <HI>Fauns,</HI> is also a model of the <HI>Edystone</HI> light-house,<NOTE PLACE="marg">EDYSTONE.</NOTE> which was burnt down in the year 1755, and succeeded by the present, the work of our able engineer the late Mr. <HI>Smeaton.</HI></P>

<P><PB N="67" REF="82"/>THIS noble peer was painted by Sir <HI>Godfrey Kneller,</HI> and was one of the few pictures which that unprincipled painter, as Mr. <HI>Walpole</HI> says, would not gladly have disowned the moment it was paid for. The earl of <HI>Nottingham</HI> was, as <HI>Dalrymple</HI> repre∣sents him to have been, most vehement in his political principles, both in church and state, so that he could hereby not live in charity with those who differed from him. He undertook the defence of the former against the attack made upon it by the famous <HI>Whiston,</HI> in a letter in 1719, addressed to his lordship, which the earl answered; for which his lordship received from the univer∣sity of <HI>Oxford,</HI> in full convocation, its solemn thanks, for his noble defence of the Christian faith. He died <HI>January</HI> 1, 1729-30. His zeal (as Mr. <HI>Walpole</HI> observes) caused him during life to suffer many aspersions. In all probability the following may have been one: a stanza in the translation of the 4th Epistle, lib. ii. of <HI>Horace, Ne sit ancillae tibi amor pudori,</HI> by the Earl of to the Earl of <HI>S.</HI></P>

In the next year the earl was constituted lord high admiral of <HI>England.</HI> Lord <HI>Clarendon</HI> speaks of him when he was appointed privy counsel, as if it was done for ornament! He took, in the consequent troubles, a part adverse to the king. But in 1648, he voted that his majesty's concessions were sufficient grounds for settling the peace of the kingdom. The army soon settled that affair. His lordship retired from the tyranny of the times, became one of the instru∣ments of the Restoration, and died in 1668.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">PORTH-MAWR.</NOTE>IN 1570 <HI>William Moston</HI> (for till the time of his son, Sir <HI>Thomas Mostyn,</HI> knight, that was the manner in which the name was spelt) meditated a design of building a new house. By what he executed it appears to have been planned in form of a quadrangle, the old house to have been rebuilt, and to have formed the centre, the other three sides to have been the offices. He finished only one, which from the great gate-way in the middle bears to this day the name of <HI>Porth mawr.</HI></P>
<P>THE date is expressed in this manner: <HI>ANNO MUNDI</HI> 5552. <HI>W. M.</HI> 1570. If I may compare small things with great, my house at <HI>Bychton</HI> was rebuilt, and my house at <HI>Merton Uchlan</HI> was also built in the same year; so it seems to have been an improving age.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">LIBRARY.</NOTE>AT one end of this building is the library, a room most un∣worthy of the valuable collection of manuscripts and books it contains. Few, if any, can boast of the number or beauty of the first, especially the illuminated; and I suspect that the num∣ber, rarity, and value of the antient classics, medallic histories, gems, and variety of every species of polite literature, is without parallel. They are of the scarcest editions, and printed by the most esteemed printers. I am indebted to Mr. <HI>Edward Clarke,</HI> A. M. of <HI>Jesus</HI> college, <HI>Cambridge,</HI> for a select catalogue of the most valuable manuscripts and books. The articles mentioned are attended with our joint notes; but my share must candidly be confessed to have been the smallest. Mr. <HI>Clarke</HI> may be said to be a scholar, <HI>ex traduce.</HI> His mother
<PB N="73" REF="88"/>
was daughter to the Rev. Dr. <HI>William Wotton,</HI> famous for having given a translation of the laws of <HI>Howel Dda.</HI> His grandfather, WILLIAM CLARKE, M. A. was still more eminent. He assisted <HI>Wotton</HI> in his labors, by a most learned and elegant <HI>Latin</HI> preface to the <HI>Leges Wallicae.</HI> But his name will be for ever delivered to posterity for his celebrated treatise, <HI>The Connection of the Roman, Saxon, and English Coins,</HI> printed in 1767, by his friend Mr. <HI>William Bowyer.</HI> Neither must I be silent in respect to Mr. <HI>Clarke</HI>'s father, who favored the world with a very ingenious ac∣count of <HI>Spain,</HI> where he had resided some time under the patro∣nage of the earl of <HI>Bristol,</HI> the <HI>British</HI> minister at the court of <HI>Madrid.</HI></P>
<P>THE late Sir <HI>Thomas Mostyn</HI> may be said to have been the founder of the library. In the old catalogue (for Mr. <HI>Clarke</HI> has formed a most complete new one) is written, in Sir <HI>Thomas</HI>'s own hand, the following very unnecessary apology: <HI>Satius est etiosum esse quam nihil agere!</HI></P>
<P>AT <HI>Gloddaeth</HI> is another large library,<NOTE PLACE="marg">GLODDAETH LIBRARY.</NOTE> consisting chiefly of old <HI>English</HI> history, and very valuable <HI>Welsh</HI> MSS. collected by Sir <HI>Roger Mostyn,</HI> grandfather to the present baronet.</P>

<P><HI>Biblia Sacra Antiqua.</HI> Quarto, vel. slightly illuminated. In most curious small <HI>gothic</HI> letter.</P>
<P>Of the magnificent MS. '<HI>Boccace des nob. &amp; illust. Femmes,</HI>' Foll. vell. illum. it should be observed that the illuminations, in point of beauty and number, exceed any thing of the kind. The principal illumination or frontespiece is a representation of our first parents in the garden of <HI>Eden.</HI> The Deity is here pourtrayed in the papal robes, with the tiara on his brow, handing <HI>Eve</HI> out of <HI>Adam</HI>'s side. Two angels in white sur∣plices support his train, which is of blue and gold. The garden is enclosed by the walls and windows of a <HI>gothic</HI> cathedral.</P>
<P>TOWARDS the end of the volume is a representation of Pope <HI>Joan</HI>'s <HI>accouchement</HI> in the public streets of <HI>Rome,</HI> in her way to the <HI>Lateran</HI> church, between the <HI>Coliseum</HI> and <HI>St. Clement</HI>'s church, attended by two cardinals, preceded by a white friar, and followed by a numerous concourse of mob. This cele∣brated Popess (if such there ever was) is said to have been a <HI>German</HI> girl, who had assumed the habit of our sex, went to <HI>Athens</HI> to study, and made such a progress as to be the asto∣nishment of every body. By what steps she rose to the papacy I am not told. She attained it in 853, and discharged all the duties of it under the name of <HI>John</HI> VIII. She unfortunately proved a frail mortal. Her holiness had an intrigue, and the consequences appeared as related. Unable to bear the shame, she died on the spot. This affair gave occasion to a thousand controversies: which side had the right is little worth enquiry. Mr. <HI>Misson</HI> enters deeply into it, see vol. ii. p. of his <HI>Travels.</HI>
<PB N="75" REF="90"/>
He takes the affirmative part, and gives us an engraving of the fa∣mous chair (see tab. vii. p. 119) on which every pope, after the cruel deception, is obliged to sit. It has in the middle a hole like that of a <HI>selle-percée,</HI> on which the new pope is obliged to sit <HI>sans culottes,</HI> and the youngest deacon to make a report that his holiness has not imposed on the <HI>catholic</HI> world.</P>
<P>THE horrors of the various and barbarous modes of execution exhibited in most of the pages, take away the pleasure of exa∣mining minutely this fine MS.</P>
<P><HI>Comedia di Dante,</HI> fol. vell. illum. A most infernal MS. in <HI>gothic</HI> letters; the illuminations coarse, numerous as horrid; on every page devils are represented in all forms. Fancy seems exhausted. Done by the <HI>Fuseli</HI> of the time. Mr. <HI>Addison</HI> some∣where observes that the devils of <HI>Dante</HI> and <HI>Tasso</HI> are made hor∣rible by their horns, claws, and tails; <HI>Milton</HI>'s by their evil pas∣sions. I wish the reader could compare the deformity of the dae∣mons in this MS. with the greater deformities occasioned by the evil passions which render detestable even the beauteous features of the fallen angels, painted by the admirable <HI>Westall</HI> for Mr. <HI>Boydel</HI>'s <HI>Milton.</HI> It should seem as if the ideas of our great poet had transmigrated into our young painter, to give the present times the fulness of his conceptions.</P>
<P><HI>Chroniques de Jean Froissart, en deux livres, avec figures.</HI> Folio, vell. illum.—A very fair and antient manuscript, with the history of every chapter curiously painted in gold and water-colors. It was written in <HI>Froissart</HI>'s own time, or near it, and belonged to a <HI>Holland.</HI> The first lord <HI>Buckhurst</HI> made a present of it to Sir <HI>William Cecil.</HI> The arms of the <HI>Hollands</HI> are often painted
<PB N="76" REF="91"/>
in the initial letters, and in others the arms of the nobility men∣tioned in the history.</P>
<P>THE frontespiece to this volume is a battle, with a town at a distance. The <HI>French</HI> appear victorious; their cavalry driving be∣fore them that of the fugitive <HI>English.</HI> I compared the text of this valuable MS. with the <HI>French</HI> edition, printed at <HI>Lyons</HI> in 1559, and the famous translation by Sir <HI>John Berniers,</HI> lord <HI>Bourchier,</HI> done in 1525, and find both vary in language, but not in sense, from this manuscript. Another volume of the first and second books, equally beautiful, is to be found in the <HI>Gloddaeth</HI> library; which I thus describe in my <HI>Tour in Wales,</HI> ii. p. 337.
<Q>The frontespiece represents the author on his knees, in a blue man∣tle, presenting his book to <HI>Edward</HI> III. A king of <HI>France,</HI> distin∣guished by the <HI>fleurs-de-lis</HI> on his robes, holds a queen by the hand, who, from the arms of <HI>England,</HI> and the lions on her robe, seems to be queen <HI>Philippa,</HI> to whom <HI>Froissart</HI> was clerk of the closet. She holds by the hand a little boy, whose robe is also marked with the lions. This must have been <HI>Richard</HI> of <HI>Bour∣deaux,</HI> her grandson, afterwards <HI>Richard</HI> II. A lady and several other figures appear in the piece.</Q>

<P><HI>Imperatoris Caesaris Maximiliani, de Vita sua, Comm.</HI> Quarto, superb illum. with a portrait of the emperor, and a view of his study.</P>
<P><HI>Maximiliam</HI> I. was born in 1459. He first married, in 1477, <HI>Mary</HI> of <HI>Burgundy.</HI> After her death he married by proxy <HI>Ann</HI> of <HI>Bretagne:</HI> but <HI>Charles</HI> VIII. of <HI>France</HI> actually married her in person, and in consequence added her dominion to that of his successors. The illuminations are very beautiful. His own portrait is the first, sitting in a rich chair, at a table, with his pen in his hand. That of his christening is the next. In another he is instructed in the art of beleaguering. A fourth places him in his study, drawing figures astrological, calculating some great event. From the king to the cobler, every one was in those ages an astrologer.—Consult <HI>Sully,</HI> 410 edit. i. 78.81.382.530.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="93"/>ONE side of the study is filled with books, mostly clasped, with their faces outwards, the leaves gaily painted. Above <HI>Maximi∣lian</HI> are his cross-bows, his bows and arrows, the instruments of the chace; and by them his art in music is expressed by the lute. On the floor is shewn the objects of his various studies. That of artillery, by two golden cannon. Of painting, by the grinding-stone for colors, and the pallet. Of husbandry, by a hoe. Of his skill in the arts of the carpenter and joiner, by the ax, plane, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. Of the smith, by the iron anvil.—A more curious illu∣mination is not to be found!</P>
<P>IN one or other of them are depicted the deeds of his busy life. His amusements in the chace are given in various draw∣ings; such as that of the bear, the boar, the stag, the chamois, and <HI>ibex.</HI> The scenery of vast rocks and precipices, and the manner of the chasseurs overcoming all difficulties, make this a most curious delineation. There is one shewing him employed in falconry. Tilts ending most fatally, and as cruelly as shows of gladiators, next are exhibited. His marriage, and his being instructed in virtuous gallantry with the ladies of the court, and the maids of honor, all true <HI>Platonic</HI> lovers. <HI>Maximilian</HI> was also great in the field. <HI>Voltaire</HI> tells us that prince introduced the arms of the <HI>Macedonian</HI> phal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nx; and in all the military illuminations, the long pike (eighteen feet in length) is introduced. In the midst of war he preserved his gallantry. A lady is represented at the entrance of his tent, like another <HI>Syfigambis,</HI> kneeling to this second <HI>Alexander,</HI> imploring his pity.—This was the <HI>virago</HI> sister of <HI>Egmond,</HI> duke of <HI>Gueldres,</HI> who, after his death, entered
<PB N="79" REF="94"/>
<HI>Venlo,</HI> and defended it valiantly against <HI>Maximilian,</HI> who soon reduced her to submit to his mercy.—Let this close his glorious life. I shall add no more than the conclusion: for in 1519, at the age of sixty, he quitted the mortal stage, the com∣mon fate of emperors and their meanest subjects.</P>
<P><HI>La Vie de Mons. Sevin,</HI> fol.—<HI>Francis Sevin,</HI> a learned <HI>Frenchman,</HI> one of the Academy Royal of Inscriptions, &amp;c. at <HI>Paris,</HI> appoint∣ed (in conjunction with <HI>l'Abbê Fourmont</HI>) to travel into <HI>Greece</HI> in search of antient MSS. He returned in 1730, and with such success, that he was rewarded with the place of keeper of the royal MSS. He was born in 1699, died in 1741, leaving be∣hind numbers of learned memoirs, printed among those of the academy.</P>
<P><HI>Lactantius Firmianus,</HI> 1663. fol. vell. the writing most ele∣gant, like the finest type, in the manner of <HI>Aldus.</HI> One side of the margin is prettily illuminated with a fancy scroll; birds, &amp;c.</P>

<P>THIS department is not to be left without mention of the most valuable illumination of a <HI>British</HI> library the pedegree of the family. This is rich in two. One is not less than forty-two feet long; which, after passing through the <HI>British</HI> and <HI>Saxon</HI> race of monarchs, pursues its purpose through the monarchs of <HI>Israel;</HI> reaches <HI>Noah</HI> and his ark, and finishes with <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve.</HI> Our bards were our heralds and genealogists. This must originally have been composed by one, who, I dare say, was in∣finitely displeased that he was cruelly stopped in his progress by our first parents, and by the <HI>Mosaic</HI> account denying to him all power of extending his patron's lineage into that of the <HI>Pre-Adamites.</HI> The other pedegree (notwithstanding it is most beau∣tifully illuminated) is scarcely worth mention, being a mere abridgment of the former, and not above twenty-two feet in length.</P>

<P>TO this classical list let me add a modern edition of the BIBLE, remarkable for its magnificence, but more so for a singular <HI>erratum.</HI> It was printed by <HI>Basket,</HI> at the <HI>Clarendon</HI>
<PB N="85" REF="100"/>
press, in 1717, in two vast volumes. It is adorned with a frontes-piece, and various head-pieces, from paintings by Sir <HI>James Thornhill,</HI> and others, engraven by <HI>Vander Gutch, de Bosche,</HI> &amp;c. The ridiculous mistake is in the running-title to the twentieth chapter of St. <HI>Luke;</HI> in which 'Parable of the vineyard' is printed 'Parable of the <HI>vinegar;</HI>' and on that account the edition is better known by the name of the <HI>Vinegar Bible,</HI> than any other.</P>

<P N="3">3. THE eagle of <HI>Jupiter,</HI> with extended pinions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">JUPITER'S EAGLE.</NOTE> retaining the thunder in its claws. This has been suspended as a vow at the shrine of that deity. The same figure often occurs upon the antient lamps, as will be shewn hereafter. <HI>Montfaucon</HI> has given
<PB N="86" REF="101"/>
an exact representation of this figure in vol. i. pl. 154. It there forms the principal ornament of a bronze lamp; and over it is this inscription:

<P N="5"><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>LLUS.</NOTE>5. THE PHALLUS, certainly intended as a pendant for the ear. With the ancients it was a symbol of secundity. <HI>Herodotus</HI> mentions its having been carried in solemn procession at the sacrifices of <HI>Bacchus. Athenaeus</HI> speaks of one carried in this manner, which was twenty cubits long, and formed entirely of gold. It was moreover adorned with garlands, which were twined round to its vertex, where was a golden star, six cubits in circumference. See <HI>Athen.</HI> lib. v. c. 5. At <HI>Isernia,</HI> a province in the kingdom of the two <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cilies,</HI> the women annually celebrate the anniversary of their patron saint, by offering at his shrine <HI>ex voto</HI> of wax, represent∣ing the male organs of generation, which they style St. <HI>Cosmus</HI>'s toes. Sir <HI>W. Hamilton</HI> addressed a letter to the <HI>Dilettanti</HI> society upon this curious circumstance, which he accompanied with dif∣ferent specimens of the usual offerings! This letter gave birth to a very learned and ingenious essay, by Mr. <HI>Knight,</HI> on the ancient worship of <HI>Priapus,</HI> written at the request of the society! and partially distributed for their use! In the course of this work
<PB N="87" REF="102"/>
Mr. <HI>Knight</HI> thus expresses himself:
<Q>Whatever the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Egyptians</HI> meant by the symbol in question, it was certainly nothing ludicrous or licentious; of which we need no other proof than its having been carried in solemn procession, at the celebration of those mysteries, in which the first principles of their religion, the knowledge of the God of nature, the FIRST, the SUPREME, the INTELLECTUAL (v. <HI>Plut.</HI> de ls. &amp; Os.) were preserved from the vulgar superstitions, and com∣municated under the strictest oaths of secrecy to the initiated; who were obliged to purify themselves, prior to their initiation, by abstaining from <HI>venery, and all impure food.</HI></Q></P>
<P>I FIND this detestable worship among the <HI>Gentoos</HI> in <HI>Indostan.</HI> Captain <HI>Alexander Hamilton,</HI> in his account of the <HI>East Indies,</HI> i. p. 381, gives the following relation:
<Q>In all this tract between <HI>Gamgam</HI> and <HI>Jagarnaut,</HI> the visible god in most esteem is <HI>Go∣palsami,</HI> whose temples are decorated with obscene representa∣tions of men and women in indecent postures, also of demons and caco-demons, whose shameful parts are of a prodigious size, in proportion to their bodies. This filthy image is worshipped by the heathens of both sexes; but barren women are his greatest devotees, and bring him the best oblations.</Q></P>

The antients retained the form of it in their domestic utensils, and vessels of libation, long after the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se of it had been superseded by the more convenient <HI>amphora.</HI></P>
<P N="7"><PB N="88" REF="103"/><NOTE PLACE="marg">PATERA.</NOTE>7. AN instrument of sacrifice, by some falsely called a <HI>patera. Montfaucon</HI> has proved that these instruments, round, flat, having no cavity to contain the liquor, are not <HI>paterae. Beger</HI> supposes them to be what <HI>Isidorus</HI> calls <HI>apophereta,</HI> which were used as plates to hold fruit and other viands.
<Q>Apophereta, a ferendo poma vel aliud, nominata; est enim plana.</Q>
See <HI>Mont∣faucon,</HI> tom ii. pl. 63. fig. 2.</P>
<P>THE <HI>paterae</HI> were very different from those designed for festive purposes. The latter were rich goblets, or a species of tankard. <HI>Montfaucon</HI> has, in vol. iii. part 1. p. 146, to p. 149, engraven several kinds. <HI>Virgil,</HI> in describing <HI>Dido</HI>'s royal feast, says,
<Q>Implevit mero pateram.</Q>
After the fair queen had made a delicate libation, she pre∣sented the goblet to the jovial <HI>Trojan, Bitias,</HI> who drank it up at one tip. The Poet describes it most humorously and em∣phatically:
<Q><L>Tum <HI>Bit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e</HI> dedit increpitans: ille impiger hausit,</L>
<L>Spumantem pateram, et pleno se <HI>proluit</HI> auro.</L></Q></P>
<P N="8"><NOTE PLACE="marg">A SPECULUM.</NOTE>8. A SPECULUM, or mirror, of some metallic substance, at this day retaining a polish equal to the first telescope reflector. Bishop <HI>Watson,</HI> in his <HI>Chemical Essays,</HI> vol. iii. p. 335, has given a pretty comment on the composition of these <HI>specula.</HI> 'Cop∣per,' says the ingenious prelate,
<Q>communicates a smell both to gold and silver. The <HI>Roman specula,</HI> which they used as looking-glasses in <HI>Pliny</HI>'s time, were commonly made of silver; but the silver was alloyed with much copper; for we
<PB N="89" REF="104"/>
find a cunning waiting-maid in <HI>Plantus,</HI> advising her mistress to wipe her fingers after having handled a <HI>speculum,</HI> least her paramour should suspect her of receiving silver from some other lover:</Q>
<Q><L>Ut speculum tenuisti, metue ne oleant argentum manus,</L>
<L>Ne usque argentum te accipisse suspicitur <HI>Philolocles.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P N="9">9. THE STRIGIL, a crooked instrument for scraping the muscles.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A STRIGIL.</NOTE> It was in high request among the <HI>Romans. Montfaucon</HI> gives the figures of several. Among others, he has pourtrayed a man of rank in the bath, while two boys are seen on each side of him, using the <HI>strigil.</HI> This instrument is very common on all the <HI>Greek</HI> vases, and is always represented among the ceremonies of the bath.</P>
<P N="10">10. A COMB, exactly resembling those now in use. This also formed a necessary article among the bathing apparatus.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A COMB.</NOTE></P>

A <HI>Roman</HI> colony was established there in the time of <HI>Marcius Rex,</HI> from whom it received its addition. It is full of antiquities, which have been used in the various modern buildings. Those in question came from the walls of the archbishop's palace; and were brought here by the late Sir <HI>Thomas Mostyn.</HI> The en∣graving,
<PB N="92" REF="110"/>
with the inscriptions, taken from the 2d volume of my <HI>Tour,</HI> gives a full idea of these funebrial memorials.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">TORQUES.</NOTE>THE golden <HI>torques,</HI> that invaluable morsel in possession of this family, was found by digging in a garden near to <HI>Harlech</HI> castle in 1692. It is well described by <HI>Camden,</HI> as a wreathed rod of gold, about four feet long, with three spiral furrows, with sharp intervening ridges running its whole length to the ends, which are plain, truncated, and turn back like pot-hooks. Whether this was purely <HI>Roman,</HI> or whether it might not have been common to both nations, I will not dispute. The use was that of a baldric, to suspend gracefully the quiver of men of rank, which hung behind, by means of the hook; and the golden wreath crossed the breast, and passed over the shoulder. <HI>Virgil,</HI> in his beautiful description of the exercises of the <HI>Trojan</HI> youth, expresses the manner, in these frequently misconstrued lines:
<Q><LG>
<L>Cornea bina ferunt: prae<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ixo hastilia ferro:</L>
<L>Pars leves <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>umer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> pharetras: ait pectore summo</L>

<L>Each brandishing aloft a cornel spear:</L>
<L>Some on their backs their burnish'd quiver bore,</L>

</LG></Q></P>
<P>THE <HI>torch,</HI> or <HI>torques,</HI> worn by the <HI>Gauls</HI> and <HI>Britons,</HI> was a very different affair, a collar of gold, or other metal, worn round the neck. Our heroine <HI>Boadicea</HI> had a great one of that precious metal; and <HI>Virdomaerus</HI> wore round his neck another, fastened behind with hooks, which fell off when the conqueror cut off his head.</P>

<L>Illi virgatis jaculanti ex agmine braccis</L>

<P><HI>Manlius</HI> acquired the addition of <HI>Torquatus,</HI> from a <HI>torques</HI> which he won from a <HI>Gaul,</HI> whom he flew in single combat, in sight of the army; and <HI>Publius Cornelius,</HI> after the slaughter of the <HI>Boii,</HI> took, among other spoils, not fewer than four thousand and seventy golden torques.</P>
<P>THEY were also in use among the <HI>Romans,</HI> who bestowed them as military rewards; and, as <HI>Pliny</HI> pretends, the golden on the auxiliaries, the silver on the citizens. They probably were made in several ways. I have seen a very beautiful one (I think at present in possession of the Rev. Mr. <HI>Prescot,</HI> of <HI>Stockport)</HI> composed of several links of silver wire, most elegantly twisted together: it was long enough to go twice round the neck, and had clasps which fastened it on.</P>
<P>THE custom of wearing the <HI>torques</HI> was continued from the more remote periods of <HI>Britain,</HI> to later times. <HI>Llewellyn,</HI> a lord of <HI>Yale,</HI> was called <HI>Llewelyn aur Dorchog,</HI>
<Q>Llewelyn, with the golden torques,' on that account; and the common proverb, <HI>Mi a dynna'r dorch a chwi,</HI> I will pluck the <HI>torques</HI> with you,</Q>
signifies to this day, a hard struggle of a person before he would yield a victory.</P>
<P>THE next antiquity is, as to material, <HI>British;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">COPPER CAKE.</NOTE> as to its destina∣tion, <HI>Roman.</HI> I refer to the cake of copper smelted at the antient <HI>Conovium,</HI> the modern <HI>Caer-bên,</HI> near to <HI>Conwy,</HI> which probably was smelted from the ore of the <HI>Snowdon</HI> hills, where of late years much has been got.

<P>FINALLY, in the library, is a most exquisite drawing upon vellum, of the crucifixion, done with a lead pencil, twenty-two inches by fifteen. It formerly hung in the approach to the chapel, and was brought there by the lady of Sir <HI>Thomas Mostyn,</HI> the second baronet. That lady, as I have before mentioned, was a <HI>Roman</HI> catholic, and placed it where it was originally found, to exalt her devotion. The drawing was made after a pi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ture by <HI>Rub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns,</HI> as the inscription shews, <HI>P.

<P>OF the seven churches in the hundred of <HI>Coleshill,</HI> part of the <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n dis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ros, Wisford,</HI> as it is called in the <HI>Doomsday Book,</HI> is one. The name was changed to <HI>Whiteford,</HI> of derivation un∣known. In the <HI>Doomsday Book</HI> notice is also taken of some of the present townships, such as <HI>Tre-Mostyn, Tre-Bychton,</HI> and <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ton,</HI> under the names of <HI>Mostone, Widford, Putecaine,</HI> and <HI>Mer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tone.

<P><HI>Widford</HI> is joined with <HI>Putecaine,</HI> the first seems to have com∣prehended our present <HI>Tre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lan,</HI> or the place where the church-village now stands. These had one plough land, two villeyns, and twelve others between men and maid servants, fisheries, and a wood half a mile long, and forty perches broad; the value was the same with that of <HI>Mostone.</HI></P>
<P>WITH <HI>Mereton</HI> is joined the third part of <HI>Widford,</HI> and the <HI>Berewicha,</HI> or hamlet of <HI>Caldecote,</HI> the last at present a township of the parish of <HI>Holywell.</HI> In this division was a presbyter, a church, and six villeyns. Here was a wood half a mile long, and twenty perches broad. One <HI>Odin</HI> held these of the earl.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="118"/>THE church stands in the township of <HI>Tre lan.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">THE CHURCH.</NOTE> It is dedi∣cated to St. <HI>Mary;</HI> so popular was that Saint, that thirteen churches in our country were placed under her patronage, and thirteen wakes kept on that day. The living is a rectory, a sine∣cure, which, with the vicarage, is in the gift of the bishop of <HI>St. Asaph.</HI> The church consists of a nave, with a good plain tower-steeple. It has besides a side aile, built by a <HI>Blithyn Drow,</HI> of the house of <HI>Mostyn,</HI> to whom that part belongs.</P>
<P>DIVINE service is performed every <HI>Sunday,</HI> alternately in <HI>Welsh</HI> and in <HI>English.</HI> At the first the congregation is very nume∣rous, and at all times truly serious and devout. The dress of even the poorest, neat and whole, and very unlike the squalid ragged figures, too frequently seen in the congregations of many a southern county.</P>
<P>OFFERINGS at funerals are kept up here, and I believe in all the <HI>Welsh</HI> churches. A disgusting, and in cases in which the deceased may have died of an infectious distemper, a dan∣gerous custom, often prevales, of the corpse being brought into church during divine service, and left there till the congregation is dismissed.</P>
<P>THAT excellent <HI>memento</HI> to the living, the <HI>passing-bell,</HI> is punctually sounded. I mention this, because idle niceties have in great towns often caused the disuse. It originated before the Reformation, to give notice to the priest to be ready to do the last duty of extreme unction to the departing person, in case he had no other admonition. The canon (67) allows one short peal after death, one other before the funeral, and one other after the funeral. The second is still in use, and is a single bell

The ann<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al revenue in interest and land is 68 <HI>l.</HI> yet the poor's rates are alarmingly high. In the beginning of the pre∣sent century poor rates had not taken place. Collections were made in the church for the sick and the aged. Filial piety had at that time f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> possession of the breasts of the children, or great affection the part of more distant relations, and the pangs of p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>verty were as much as possible alleviated. There was also a laudable p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in them, which made them above suffering their friends to be a burden to their fellow parishioners; all this gra∣dually ceased, and the warmth of natural affection soon quite dis∣appeared. I cannot but mention an instance of the rapid increase of taxes in my days. In the year 1756 <HI>William Lloyd,</HI> smith, was one of the overseers of the poor; at that time the annual tax was only 6 <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</HI> 3 <HI>c.</HI> 1 <HI>d.</HI> He was appointed again overseer in the year 17<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, when the tax was increased to 600<HI>l. William Lloyd</HI> is now living, but the books prove the exactness of the assertion.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">SCHOOL.</NOTE>IN the village is the school. It was founded by <HI>Mary Brad∣shaw,</HI> widow of <HI>Thomas Williams,</HI> of <HI>Mostyn Gate,</HI> who bequeathed by will, dated 1745, the interest of 141<HI>l.</HI> to be paid to the mas∣ter of the said school, for instructing for ever, annually, fourteen children, who are instructed in reading and writing <HI>English,</HI> and

accounts. The present school-house was built by <HI>Pyers Jones,</HI> an opulent farmer of this parish, who also bestowed a very hand∣some brass chandelier on the church.</P>
<P>IN this and a few other of the mineral parishes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CLUB</NOTE> is a <HI>Cymdei∣thos,</HI> or club, instituted in 1766, for the support of the members in case of illness, or any accidents, provided they are not con∣tracted by intemperance, fighting, or any immoral act. Our club consists of 240 members, each of whom contributes monthly 8<HI>d.</HI> which is put into a box locked with three keys; two are kept by the stewards, and the third by the person to whom the box is intrusted, so that all three must be present at the taking out or putting in of any money. The club has been of late years for∣tunate enough to have saved three hundred pounds, which is put out on good security, and kept in reserve against any calamitous times, such as seasons of sickness, or uncommon successions of accidents.</P>
<P>IN case of illness a certain allowance is made till the time of their recovery, or till they are deemed incurable. In the last case they are allowed two shillings and six pence for life. In case of death forty shillings is paid for funeral expences, and a sum to the widow proportionable to the time the husband had been member of the club.</P>
<P>WHENEVER the business requires a meeting, the steward must bring with him the tankard of ale, and a very small cup, in or∣der that the members may not exceed the bounds of temperance.</P>
<P>IF any member comes to the club in liquor, he forfeits two-pence; if he speaks ill of government, or abuses any body, or curses and swears, or will not hold his tongue when required by
<PB N="102" REF="121"/>
the stewards, he forfeits two-pence for every offence. In a word, every caution is observed to preserve the rules of morality in this our paroc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al society. Finally, there is a great annual meeting on <HI>New-Year's Day,</HI> in which every member attends. Every one appears neatly dressed, carrying a wand gally painted, and make altogether a most respectable figure, ranged in two lines from the porch door to that of the church.</P>
<P>I STEP into the church-yard, and sigh over the number of departed which f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll the inevitable retreat. In no distant time the north side, like those of all other <HI>Welsh</HI> churches, was, through some superstition, to be occupied only by persons exe∣cuted, or by suicides. It is now nearly as much crowded as the other parts. The most remarkable inscription is on a head-stone set up by myself.</P>

<Q><P>This small Monument of esteem was erected by his lamenting Master in Memory of LOUIS GOLD, a <HI>Norman</HI> by Birth, and above twenty years the faithful Servant and Friend of THOMAS PENNANT, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> of <HI>Downing.</HI></P>
<P>In his various services he made considerable savings, which he disposed of by his last will (having no relations of his own) with affection to his friends and to his fellow-servants, with unmerited gratitude to his Master and his family, and with piety to the poor.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="124"/>
Every duty of his humble station, and every duty of life, He discharged so fully, That when the day sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll come which levels all distinction of ranks, He may, By the favor of our blessed Mediator, hear these joyful words, "Well done, thou good and faithful servant, enter thou into the joy of thy Lord." He was born at St. <HI>Hermes de Rouvelle</HI> in <HI>Normandy, August</HI> 22, 1717; died at <HI>Downing, August</HI> 20, 1785; and was interred in the Church-yard near this wall on the 22d of the same month.</P></Q>
The wealth which <HI>Louis</HI> had acquired was considerable. Above sixteen hundred pounds passed through my hands. He had be∣sides a thousand pounds, which a setter to an attorney prevaled on the good man to sink with the man of the law for an an∣nuity. Death soon put the lawyer in possession of the principal. I lament this; for I had been left by him residuary legatee and sole executor, with a power to dispose of the remainder (all legacies paid) in charitable uses. Thus a thousand pounds were lost to <HI>Whiteford</HI> parish. The interest of the remainder is quarterly divided among the worthiest of our poor, who may annually bless so excellent a benefactor.</P>
<P><HI>Louis</HI> was bred a <HI>Roman</HI> catholic, and notwithstanding he occa∣sionally frequented the prayers of our church, he chose to be buried according to the rites of those of <HI>Rome,</HI> which were per∣formed
<PB N="105" REF="125"/>
in a room in my house. He left twenty pounds to the gentleman who performed the service. I fixed on the Re∣verend <HI>Philip Jones,</HI> who had in this neighborhood near fifty years discharged his function in a manner truly exemplary. I took up the old custom of attending a faithful friend to his grave, a respect the excellency of his conduct clamed from me.</P>
<P>NEAR to the tomb of <HI>Nicolas Pennant,</HI> is another in memory of <HI>Hugh Pennant,</HI> son and heir of <HI>Robert Pennant,</HI> of <HI>Downing,</HI> (see p. 9.) who was buried <HI>August</HI> 16th, 1675, with this best of cha∣racters:
<Q>He lived honestly, and hurt nobody. He gave every one his due.</Q></P>
<P>NEAR to this place, tumbled on the ground,<NOTE PLACE="marg">PIERCES OF YSGLAN.</NOTE> is a stone in memory of a <HI>Pierce</HI> of <HI>Ysglan,</HI> in this parish, a respectable family now extinct, descended from <HI>Ednowen Bendew.</HI> The crest of this family is a boar's head marked with a crescent, a sign of its having been a second branch.

<P>ALL are small. The first has the figure of a man and woman kneeling on opposite sides of a desk. Two sons are behind the man, and three daughters behind the woman, in the same at∣titudes. They are most neatly engraven on a tablet of white marble, and the whole included in a very neat frame. The in∣scription gives their brief tale:
<Q>Neere to this lyeth the body of <HI>Elizabeth Mostyn,</HI> one of the Coheires of <HI>Rich. Aldersey</HI> of the Citie of <HI>Chester,</HI> Gent. Wife to <HI>Will. Mostyn,</HI> Arch. <HI>Bang.</HI> and Rector of <HI>Chrysilton.</HI> By whom he had issve three sonnes and two daughters. She de∣parted this life the 10th of <HI>April,</HI> Ann. Dni. 1647.</Q></P>
<P>TWO of the sons were heads of two families, those of <HI>Bryng∣wyn,</HI> in <HI>Montgomeryshire,</HI> and those of <HI>Segroit,</HI> in <HI>Denhighshire.</HI></P>
<P>THE next records the death of a son of <HI>Gwydyr.</HI> The arms of the house, three spread-eagles and three lions, are cut on the
<PB N="108" REF="129"/>
tablet. Above is the crest, and on the entablature, MORTUUS VIVO. The inscription follows:
<Q>Here lyeth interred the body of <HI>Ellici Wynn,</HI> the 9th son of Sir <HI>John Wynn,</HI> of <HI>Gwydyr,</HI> Knight and Baronet, aged xx, who died the xxth of 9<HI>ber,</HI> and was buried the xxiii of the said month, Ao. Domini 1619. Omnis caro foenum.</Q>
Conjoined with the last is the tablet of one of our vicars, neat, like the others, only his arms are cut on the stone; the epitaph beneath:
<Q>Near this place lieth interr∣ed the body of Mr. <HI>Richard C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tmor,</HI> late Vicar of <HI>Whitford,</HI> and Rector of <HI>Aber,</HI> who died the xxvii day of <HI>July,</HI> MDCLXXXIIII, and was buri∣ed the 3<SUP>o</SUP>, aetatis suae 42.</Q>

</LETTER>
<P>ON a brass plate, now covered with the <HI>Downing</HI> seat, is a memorial of <HI>Morris Kyffin,</HI> of <HI>Maenan,</HI> who died (a youth) <HI>June</HI> 2d, 1610, at <HI>Bychton,</HI> on a visit to his sister <HI>Jane,</HI> wife to <HI>Pyers Pennant.</HI></P>
<P>THE next township to the village is in <HI>Whitford Garn.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">GARREG.</NOTE> In this township is <HI>Garreg,</HI> or <HI>The Rock,</HI> the highest land in the parish; it is a large inclosed hill, the property of Sir <HI>Roger Mostyn.</HI> Part of it is a fine turf, and excellent sheep-walk;
<PB N="112" REF="133"/>
the summit, and part of the sides, rocky. From <HI>Whiteford</HI> to the top is a continual ascent. From this height the traveller may have an august foresight of the lofty tract of <HI>Snowdon,</HI> from the crooked <HI>Moel Shabog,</HI> at one end, to the towering <HI>Pen∣maen-mawr</HI> at the other; of the vast promontory of <HI>Llandudno,</HI> and part of the isle of <HI>Anglesea,</HI> with the great bay of <HI>Llanddulas,</HI> forming an extensive crescent; the estuaries of the <HI>Dee</HI> and the <HI>Mersey;</HI> and to the <HI>North</HI> (at times) the isle of <HI>Man</HI> and the <HI>Cumberland Alps,</HI> the frequent presages of bad weather.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">PHAROS.</NOTE>THE <HI>Romans</HI> took advantage of this elevated situation, and placed on its summit a <HI>Pharos,</HI> to conduct the navigators to and from <HI>Deva,</HI> along the difficult channel of the <HI>Seteia Portus.</HI> The building is still remaining. It is tolerably entire; its form is circular; the inner diameter twelve feet and a half; the thickness of the walls four feet four inches. The doors, or entrances, are opposite to each other; over each is a square funnel, like a chimney, which opens on the outside, about half-way up the building. On each side is a window. About four feet from the ground are three circular holes, lined with mortar, as is frequent in <HI>Roman</HI> buildings; and penetrate the whole wall, for purposes now unknown.</P>
<P>WITHINSIDE are the vestiges of a stair-case, which led to the floors, of which there appear to have been two. Along such part of the upper, which was conspicuous from the channel, are eight small square openings, cased with free-stone (the rest of the building being of rude lime-stone, bedded in hard mortar) and each of these were separated by wooden pannels, placed in deep grooves, the last still in a perfect state. In each of these
<PB REF="134"/>
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="113" REF="135"/>
partitions were placed the lights, which the <HI>Romans</HI> thought ne∣cessary to keep distinct, or to prevent from running into one, lest they should be mistaken by seamen for a star. <HI>Periculum in corrivatione ignium, ne sidus existimetur.</HI></P>
<P>TO the building is very evidently a broad and raised road, pointing from the east; and near its upper end are the marks of a trench, which surrounded and gave protection to this useful edifice. It certainly had in later times been repaired, or perhaps applied to some other use, for in one part is a piece of timber which could not have been aboriginal.</P>
<P>THE curious cross called <HI>Maen Achwynfan,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">MAEN ACHWYN∣FAN.</NOTE> or the stone of lamentation, stands in a small field opposite to the gate which opens from the turnpike-road into <HI>Garreg.</HI> It takes its name, in all probability, from the penances, which were often finished be∣fore such sacred pillars; attended with weeping, and the usual marks of contrition: for an example, near <HI>Stafford</HI> stood one called the <HI>weeping cross,</HI> a name analogous to ours. This is of an elegant form and sculpture; is twelve feet high, two feet four inches broad at the bottom, and ten inches thick. The base is let into another stone. The top is round, and includes, in raised work, the form of a <HI>Greek</HI> cross. Beneath, about the middle, is another, in the form of St. <HI>Andrew</HI>'s: and under that, a naked figure, with a spear in his hand. Close to that, on the side of the column, is represented some animal. The rest is covered with very beautiful fret-work, like what may be seen on other pillars, of antient date, in several parts of <HI>Great Britain.</HI> I do not presume (after the annotator on <HI>Camden</HI> has given up the point) to attempt a guess at the age; only must observe, that
<PB N="114" REF="136"/>
it must have been previous to the reign of gross superstition among the <HI>Welsh,</HI> otherwise the sculptor would have employed his chizzel in striking out legendary stories, instead of the elegant knots and interlaced work that cover the stone.</P>
<P>THOSE, who suppose it to have been erected in memory of the dead slain in battle on the spot, draw their argument from the number of adjacent tumull, containing human bones, and sculls often marked with mortal wounds; but these earthy se∣pulchres are of more antient times than the elegant sculpture of this pillar will admit. This likewise (from the crosses) is evidently a <HI>Christian</HI> monument. The former were only in use in pagan days.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">GELLI.</NOTE>THERE is likewise, near to it, an antient chapel, now a farm∣house, called <HI>Gelli,</HI> or the <HI>Hazel-grove,</HI> the name of an adjacent tract. This might have relation to the cross; as well as a place for performance of divine service to the abbot of <HI>Basingwerk,</HI> who had a house at no great distance. This tract (mis-spelt by the <HI>English, Geteley,</HI>) with the wood (at that time on it) was granted by <HI>Edward</HI> I. to the abbot and convent, on the tenth of <HI>November,</HI> at <HI>Westminster,</HI> before the death of our last prince. He also gave him power to grub up the wood; which by the nakedness of the place appears to have been done most effectually.</P>
<P>FARTHER to the west is another inclosed mountain called <HI>Glol.</HI> my own property; part is covered with hazels and large white-thorn trees (perhaps a continuation of the <HI>Gelli,</HI>) part is very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cky, part a fine sheep-walk. In many places were se∣veral druidical circles, which I believe are now injured by the removal of the stones for various uses. In the rougher parts of
<PB N="115" REF="137"/>
this inclosure are often seen vipers, which always prefer the dry and sunny parts of a country.</P>
<P>ON <HI>Sarn-Hwlkin,</HI> a little common to the east of <HI>Glol,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">SARN-HWLKIN.</NOTE> was a very long but low <HI>tumUlus,</HI> supposed by the vulgar to have been a <HI>giant's grave,</HI> from a tradition that one of our sons of <HI>Anak</HI> had been there interred. It probably did cover the remains of some <HI>British</HI> heroes of the common size, who there found their grave, after some fierce action, I have before supposed to have happened before the place.</P>
<P>THE township of <HI>Tre'r-Abbot,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">TRE'R-ABBOT.</NOTE> one of the eight which compose our parish, joins to this part of <HI>Tre-Mostyn.</HI> In it stands the house of the same name, originally the country-seat of the abbots of <HI>Basingwerk,</HI> but long since the property of the <HI>Davies's,</HI> lately sold to <HI>Edward Jones,</HI> of <HI>Wepre,</HI> <ABBR>esq</ABBR> From the proof that gentleman has given of his literary abilities in drawing up the resolutions of the <HI>Holywell</HI> association, in <HI>December</HI> 1792, I must lament they are not oftener exerted, the occasion alone ex∣cepted.</P>
<P>THIS township was once exempted from the payment of tythes by a <HI>modus,</HI> originally granted by the abbot of <HI>Basing∣werk,</HI> but which by negligence has been totally lost.</P>
<P>THE house, in Mr. <HI>Miles Davies,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">MILES DAVIES.</NOTE> produced a very extraordi∣nary genius indeed! The talents of this eccentric gentleman were poetical. He lived about the year 1716, and published three volumes of his <HI>Athenae Britannicae.</HI> In his <HI>Martii Ca∣lendae sive laudes Cambro Britanniae,</HI> is a <HI>Latin</HI> poem on <HI>St. David's Day.</HI> I never could get the sight of the books, but was indebted to the Rev. <HI>William Cole,</HI> late of <HI>Milton,</HI> near

<P>HAVING reached the farthest part of our parish, to the north-west, I return along the great heath <HI>Mynydd Tegen,</HI> or <HI>Tegen-Mountain,</HI> which yet preserves the antient name of <HI>Tegengl,</HI> which comprehended the three modern hundreds of <HI>Coleshill, Prestatyn,</HI> and <HI>Rudland.</HI> It had been the property of <HI>Edwin,</HI> descended from <HI>Roderick</HI> the Great, and called prince of <HI>Tegengl.</HI> His <HI>Llys,</HI> or royal residence, was, in 1041, near <HI>Llaneurgan</HI> or <HI>Northop.</HI> This common, for I cannot call it mountain, stretches along the whole of the higher parts of our parish, and is covered with the <HI>erica vulgaris,</HI> or common heath. It feeds numbers of sheep, and is part of the mineral tract of <HI>Flintshire.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">LLYN HELYG.</NOTE>THE manor of <HI>Mostyn,</HI> of which Sir <HI>Roger Mostyn</HI> is lord, includes the greater part of the mountain, and reaches to the sea. It was derived from the heiress of the house, descended from her ancestor, prince <HI>Edwin.</HI></P>
<P>A LARGE piece of water, now well stocked with fish, made by Sir <HI>Roger Mostyn,</HI> baronet, grandfather to the present owner,
<PB N="117" REF="139"/>
lies near that end of the heath. In the winter it is the resort of ducks and teal.</P>
<P>ON the east-side of <HI>Mostyn</HI> pool, in <HI>Tegen</HI> mountain,<NOTE PLACE="marg">PLAS CAPTAIN.</NOTE> is a grave bounded at each end by a rude stone, above four feet high. It contains the remains of captain <HI>Edward Morgan,</HI> of the adjacent house of <HI>Plâs Captain,</HI> and of the respectable family of the <HI>Mor∣gans,</HI> of <HI>Gwlgray,</HI> in the adjoining parish of <HI>Llan Asaph.</HI> Some years ago a person of strange curiosity opened the grave, and found the skeleton. On the head was a red cap, I think of velvet, and round his neck a silk handkerchief. By him lay his sword, and his helmet; and beneath the skeleton two bullets, which had fallen out of the body on its dissolution; all which verify the report of his having been slain in battle, or in some skirmish during the civil wars, and that he was interred, according to his wish, under the spot on which he fell. In a collection of pede∣grees lent to me by <HI>Thomas Gryffith,</HI> <ABBR>esq</ABBR> of <HI>Rhual,</HI> I find this short memorial of the captain, in the pedegree of his family: 'Capt. <HI>Edward Morgan,</HI> slain at <HI>Cheshire</HI> raise.' If he was slain in that county, I cannot suppose that his body would have been carried so far; nor can I account for this relation, or for the body being found here, unless that the above is a mistake, and that he fell in some skirmish near to his own house.</P>
<P>AT a small distance from <HI>Plâs Captain,</HI> is <HI>Plâs-mawr,</HI> at pre∣sent the property of Sir <HI>Edward Price Lloyd,</HI> bart. of <HI>Pengwern,</HI> in right of his worthy grandmother, <HI>Frances,</HI> daughter and heiress to <HI>Bell Jones,</HI> secretary in the civil board of ordnance in the Tower. He erected a handsome monument in <HI>Whiteford</HI> church in memory of his father <HI>Robert Jones,</HI> and others of his predeces∣sors.
<PB N="118" REF="140"/>
He died, and was buried in the chapel of the Tower, aged 49, near the remains of his wife <HI>Frances,</HI> who died <HI>No∣vember</HI> 24th, 1723, aged 48.</P>
<P>ABOUT a mile farther, the turnpike, which is named the <HI>Flint</HI> road, cresses the upper road from <HI>Newmarket</HI> to <HI>Holywell.</HI></P>
<P>IT is the first turnpike known on the <HI>Holyhead</HI> road. The act was obtained in 1755, and contained, besides the district of <HI>Flint,</HI> those of <HI>E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mere, Chester,</HI> and <HI>Mold.</HI> The part in question is called <HI>Llwybr-hir,</HI> or the <HI>long-path,</HI> for it extends along the mountain westward, as far as <HI>Brick-kiln.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>USUSES.</NOTE>ON the right hand, as you pass towards that hamlet, on a rocky elevated part, called <HI>Gelli,</HI> is a multitude of loose stones, lying on the surface. They are of the lime-stone kind, mere <HI>l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es,</HI> assuming most singular forms; some are excavated, and often perforated. This must have been done when they were in a soft state, for since their formation nothing has fallen on them but the rain of heaven, and that could not effect the phenomenon.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">ENTRENCHMENT.</NOTE>SCATTERED over this part of the mountain are several rounded <HI>tumuli;</HI> and to the le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, at some distance, is a work, pro∣bably coeval with them. On the slope of the west part of the race-ground is an entrenchment of a circular form, about a hundred and sixty-three feet in diameter, surrounded with a low bank, and on the outside of that with a ditch; in one part very shallow, in the other more deep. This circle could not have been designed as a post, or place of retreat from an enemy. Its entrenchment is weak, and it might easily be commanded from above by the rising-ground. Possibly it might have been for some religious purpose, or for a place of council, or for ha∣ranguing
<PB N="119" REF="141"/>
the people, who might assemble round the outside, and readily hear what was delivered to them.</P>
<P>ON returning along <HI>Llwybr-hîr,</HI> I rejoin the <HI>Newmarket</HI> road,<NOTE PLACE="marg">LLWYBR-HÎR.</NOTE> at the pla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d had left it, near a great inclosure belonging to Sir <HI>Roger M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> called <HI>Ty-maen.</HI> Within, near to the road,<NOTE PLACE="marg">TY-MAEN.</NOTE> is a great mount, now planted with fir-trees, the site of a castelet, probably a seat of <HI>Owen Bendew,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">EDNOWEN BEN∣DEW.</NOTE> which my friend and fellow-traveller, the late Rev. <HI>John Lloyd,</HI> supposed to have been one of the habitations of that chieftain. <HI>Owen</HI> was lord of <HI>Tegengl</HI> in 1079, and one of the fifteen tribes of <HI>North Woles.</HI> He was distinguished by the name of <HI>Pendew,</HI> or <HI>Bendew.</HI> I have consulted <HI>Davies</HI>'s, and all our dictionaries, and can find no other translation of the word than <HI>Thick-scull.</HI> Of him are descended, as the MS. of the Rev. <HI>Lewis Owen</HI> (my authority) say, many worthy families, among them <HI>Ithel ap Rotpert,</HI> arch∣deacon of <HI>Tegengl,</HI> who was living in the years 1375 and 1393, and the <HI>Bithels,</HI> and a great many families besides. I might venture to mention the living descendants of the great <HI>Bendew;</HI> for the unfortunate idea of character impressed by the <HI>cognomen</HI> is entirely worn out. They are only to be known by their arms, argent, three boars heads couped, a <HI>chevron</HI> sable.</P>
<P>THE extinct families were the <HI>Wynnes,</HI> of <HI>Galedlom,</HI> and <HI>Caerwis; Piers</HI> of <HI>Llanasaph</HI> and of <HI>Merton Ysglan,</HI> and the <HI>Williams's</HI> of <HI>Merton,</HI> both of the parish of <HI>Whiteford;</HI> the <HI>Parrys,</HI> of <HI>Coleshill</HI> and <HI>Basingwerk;</HI> the <HI>Ffachnalts,</HI> of <HI>Ffachnalts,</HI> in the parish of <HI>Mold;</HI> and the <HI>Griffiths,</HI> of <HI>Pant<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y Llo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wndŷ,</HI> in <HI>Llanhasa</HI> parish, and <HI>Griffiths</HI> of <HI>Caerwis</HI> hall; all of whom are now extinct, unless it may be in the female line.</P>

to size and population, it may rank among the most important in this division of our principality.</P>
<P>IT is bounded on the east by the <HI>Chester Channel,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">BOUNDARIES OF THE PARISH.</NOTE> the <HI>Seteia Aestuarium</HI> of <HI>Ptolemy.</HI> Its inhabitants at that time were the <HI>Or∣dovices;</HI> but whether in so long a period any of the antient blood at present runs in our veins, is extremely uncertain. The southern boundary of this parish is that of <HI>Holywell;</HI> the northern, those of <HI>Llan Asaph, Newmarket,</HI> and <HI>Cwm;</HI> and the western, those of <HI>Tremerchion</HI> and <HI>Caerwis.</HI></P>
<P>THE whole length of the parish, from its eastern extremity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">LENGTH.</NOTE> not far from <HI>Holloway</HI> turnpike-gate, to the extremity of the township <HI>Tre'r-Abbot,</HI> is about four miles two furlongs. Its greatest breadth, from the sea-side near <HI>Llanerch-y-môr,</HI> to <HI>Foel-da,</HI> ad∣joining to <HI>Yskiviog</HI> parish, is near three miles four furlongs. The northern part, which is its length, is in general a rapid descent of two miles three quarters and 136 yards, reckoning from <HI>Pen-y-ffordd Waen,</HI> to <HI>Llanerch-y-môr.</HI> All beyond to the south and to the west is <HI>Tegen</HI> mountain, or the old <HI>Tegenia,</HI> a large extent of plain swelling into gentle risings, covered chiefly with heath, and mixed with grass, unless where the lime-stone stratum appears above the surface.</P>
<P>BEING on the spot,<NOTE PLACE="marg">MINERALS.</NOTE> I shall give first some account of our minerals, the source of wealth to the land-owner, and of wealth, but oftener poverty, to the adventurous miners, who, like ad∣venturers in a lottery, to which miners may truly be compared, are tempted by the good fortune of others to risque and fre∣quently lose their all. If they are successful, they never th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k of a future day, but enjoy their fortune in good living, forgetfull

of the pains it cost them, till all is gone, and they are again compelled to take to hard labor. After a life of dissipation they sink under the fatigue, lose their health, and early become a burthen to the community, by adding to the load of paupers under which it groans.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">WORKED BY THE ROMANS.</NOTE>THE want of gun-powder, in early times, with the <HI>Romans,</HI> was a great impediment. Instead, we find that great fires were used; the rock intensely heated, and cracks formed in it by the sudden infusion of water; <HI>Pliny</HI> says of vinegar. The wedge or pick-ax was then insinuated into the apertures, and the stone or ore forced out. Miners often discover the marks of fire in antient mines. I am in possession of a little wedge, five inches and a quarter long, presented to me by the late Mr. <HI>Smedley,</HI> of <HI>Bagillt Hall,</HI> discovered in working the deep fissures of <HI>Dalar Goch</HI> rock, in the parish of <HI>Diserth,</HI> in this county. This little instrument affords a proof of its antiquity, by being almost in∣tirely incrusted with lead ore. It had probably lain in the course of some subterraneous stream, which had brought along with it the leaden particles, and deposited them on the iron.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">THEIR TOOLS.</NOTE>PICK-AXIS of an uncommon bulk, and very clumsy, have been discovered in the bottom of the mineral trenches; these seem to have been the same with the <HI>fractaria</HI> of the <HI>Romans,</HI> pick-axes of enormous size, used by the miners in the gold mines of <HI>Spain.</HI> Buckets of singular construction, and other things of uses unknown at present, have been found among the antient mines.</P>

The wedge had at the thicker end a square perforation, through which a stick was to be thrust, which was held by a man, whilst another, with repeated strokes of a mallet, drove the instrument into a crack it was to force open.</P>
<P>I AM also indebted to Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> for a plate of lead of the shape of the sole of a shoe, with an elevated rim round the sides, and furnished also with a hooked handle to hang it in the fissures of the rocks of the mines, evidently designed to have placed on it a lamp, to give the miners light in their subterraneous opera∣tions. This and another were found at the depth of sixty yards in a <HI>Roman</HI> mine.</P>
<P>OUR mineral tract is from <HI>Pen-yr-allt,</HI> or <HI>Bryn-digri,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">MINERAL TRACT.</NOTE> in a line to the western borders of <HI>Holywell</HI> parish. Its extent to north and south is very narrow. The turnpike road by <HI>Kelyn</HI> and <HI>Pen∣y-ffordd Waen,</HI> as far as <HI>Creecas,</HI> describes its course east and west. This part goes under the name of the <HI>Whiteford Rake,</HI> and is nearly the summit of the parish in this part. The veins on the east side, when they dip into the fields, scarcely ever bear.</P>
<P>THE veins run either north or south, or east or west: the last are generally found most profitable. It is singular, that the ore got in the first scarcely ever produces silver worth the re∣finer's labor.</P>
<P>THE ores differ in quality.<NOTE PLACE="marg">LEAD ORES.</NOTE> The lamellated or common kind, usually named potter's ore, yields from fourteen hundred to sixteen hundred and a quarter of lead from twenty hundred of the ore: but the last produce is rare.</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="147"/>THE quantity of silver produced from our lead is also vari∣able. The upper part of a vein of lead ore is always richest in silver; the bottom, in lead. Our refiners will assay any lead that with yield ten ounces in the ton of lead and upwards. The usual produce is fourteen ounces: sixteen have been gotten; but acquisitions of that kind within this circuit are extremely uncommon.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">CAR<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>CKFER<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE>ON the side of the <HI>Whiteford Rake</HI> are the ruins of a large bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ding called <HI>Carrickfergus,</HI> probably from being sounded by some adventurer from that town, for the purpose of smelting the ore got in its neighborhood. It is near a century old, and erected when the furnaces were constructed in a manner very different from those of the present times; for by the remains of the chimnies they seem to have been formed like those of the modern iron-furnaces.</P>
<P>THE depth of our lead-mines are various. Rich veins have been discovered to the depth of ninety yards.</P>
<P>THE veins are found either in the lime-stone rock or that of chert. These frequently go to unknown depths; the ore is pur∣sued extremely far indeed; and when it ceases, the unprofitable is usually found to consist of spar.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">GRAVEL LEAD-ORE.</NOTE>GRAVEL ore, or lumps, from forty tons weight to the size of a hazel-nut, are often discovered in what the miners call <HI>flats,</HI> or loose ground full of gravel, tumblers, and the like. It is rounded and smoothed on the surface, as if it had been rolled in violent waters: but within is pure, lamellated, and rich. It is a potter's ore, reduced to this form by accident.</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="148"/>THERE is no ascertaining the quantity of lead ore which is annually taken up in our parish, nor yet that of lead exported. It is included in the custom-house books at <HI>Chester,</HI> in the general account of the produce of the mineral parts of this county, and that of <HI>Denbigh.</HI> The number of tons exported in 1792, is as follows:

<P>ABOUT fifty years ago about seventeen hundred weight of cop∣per ore was discovered in a tenement of my father's called <HI>Cathe∣rine George's;</HI> which on being assayed was found to be very rich:<NOTE PLACE="marg">COPPER ORE.</NOTE> but none has been discovered since, notwithstanding the ground has been diligently searched.</P>
<P>LAPIS CALAMINARIS, or calamine,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CALAMINE.</NOTE> is found in very great quan∣tities almost the whole way I have mentioned, but increases in plenty as we advance eastward. It is found in veins like lead ore, often by itself; sometimes mixed with ore, which renders the break∣ing and separating a work of labor and expence; what is found in these parts is generally of the cavernous, boney, or cancellated kinds. This mineral was the <HI>Cadmia</HI> of <HI>Pliny,</HI> lib. xxxiv. c. 10; and the <HI>Stone-cadmia</HI> of <HI>Strabo,</HI> lib. iii. 248. The <HI>Romans</HI> knew its uses in making of brass; therefore cannot be supposed to have overlooked so necessary an ingredient. The remains of the brass-founderies, discovered in our kingdom, shew, that they were ac∣quainted
<PB N="126" REF="149"/>
with it. The knowlege of this mineral in after-ages was long lost. Before the reign of <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> much was im∣ported from <HI>Sweden;</HI> but at that period it was discovered again in the <HI>Mendip-hills;</HI> and, fortunately, at the same time that the working of the copper-mines in those of <HI>Cumberland</HI> was re∣newed. Our county abounds with it; but, till within these sixty years, we were so ignorant of the value, as to mend our roads with it; which have of late years been turned up in a hun∣dred places most successfully to recover the lost wealth. It was <HI>John Barrow,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">JOHN BARROW.</NOTE> a miner, from the <HI>Mendip-hills</HI> (whom I well re∣member living in this parish) who first made us acquainted with this valuable mineral, having long worked in the calamine mines of his own country.</P>
<P>IT appears that this mineral tract (which is called the <HI>Pant∣vein</HI>) has yielded ore from very early times. In the last century there have been no very rich veins: but then it is almost always yielding something, and of later years has been particularly productive of calamine. In the beginning of this century Sir <HI>Thomas Grosvenour</HI> had a good mine of lead ore on the side of the road. My grandfather had another. The benevolent, chari∣table Mr. <HI>Edwards,</HI> of <HI>Brinford,</HI> had another. The Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> of <HI>Celyn,</HI> had another. The last is said to have put a trap-door to the top of the shaft, and to have locked it, and made use of the trea∣sure below as a bank, which he had recourse to according to his wants. All these mines are on the same vein, which is an east and west, Sir <HI>Thomas Grosvenour</HI>'s mine was included in the vast mineral grant, possessed by his ancestor, see <HI>Tour in Wales,</HI> i. p. 76.
<PB N="127" REF="150"/>
All the other freeholders work on their respective freeholds. Sir <HI>Roger Mostyn</HI> on his manor of <HI>Mostyn,</HI> and on his freehold.</P>
<P>A MR. <HI>Francis Leicester,</HI> of <HI>Vauxhall,</HI> gives an account of this vein in a small pamphlet, called 'The <HI>little</HI> Mine Adven∣ture,' published in 1702. He styles himself the present lessee, and gives, I believe, a good plan of the vein in an annexed map.</P>
<P>BLACK JACK, <HI>Zinc, Pseudo-galena,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">BLACK JACK.</NOTE> is met with in large quanti∣ties near the eastern extremity of the parish. It is found to answer the purposes of calamine. It has hitherto been only exported to <HI>Bristol;</HI> and is sold there at the rate of 4<HI>l.</HI> 10<HI>s. per</HI> ton, deli∣vered. We have it in a metallic form, of a blueish grey color, and again of the colors of the dark semi-pellucid ambers. <HI>Cronsted,</HI> ii. p. 779. <HI>Magellan</HI>'s ed. calls the first, <HI>Zincum ferro sulphurato mineralisatum;</HI> the other, <HI>Zincum calciforme cum ferro sulphuratum.</HI></P>
<P>THIS semi-metal, and its ore, has been long known in <HI>India,</HI> and imported from thence in a metallic state, under the name of <HI>tutenag,</HI> as early as the year 1647. It had even been fused in the <HI>Goslar</HI> mines, as early as 1617. Yet the secret of its being an ingredient in making brass, did not reach us till the year 1738; when it was communicated to us by Mr. <HI>Von Swob.</HI> I refer to the learned Bishop <HI>Watson</HI>'s entertaining and instructive works, for a full account of this useful mineral. Let me here inform the reader from the same authority, (iv. p. 2.) that by the ac∣cident of the <HI>Dutch</HI> taking a <HI>Portuguese</HI> ship laden with cala∣mine, we learn the origin of the name, it being derived from the <HI>Arabic, calaem,</HI> the same mineral as our <HI>calamine,</HI> which is

plentifully found in the peninsula of <HI>Malacca,</HI> and probably in other parts of <HI>India.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">MILL-DISTEMPER.</NOTE>A MOST excruciating, and often fatal disorder, frequently at∣tacks the miners who work in the hard veins of lead ore, or of black jack, or of such as are solid and lodged between sides, or immersed in the rock. The disorder is called the <HI>Felyn,</HI> from <HI>Felyn,</HI> a mill. It may be translated into <HI>Mill-distemper,</HI> because it was at first most frequent in the smelting-mills; but for a considerable time past has ceased in those buildings; and that happiness may be dated from the period in which lime has been used as a flux for the lead ores.</P>
<P>IN the mines it arises from the workmen being obliged to use the pick-axe in the hard veins to get the ore out. The mi∣nute particles fly about, and are taken down into the stomach, and into the lungs. This occasions a most obstinate costiveness, attended with most dreadful pains, which have been known to last fourteen, and even twenty-one days, and attended with a strong symptomatic fever.</P>
<P><Q><HI>William Spencer,</HI> a miner, worked in <HI>Meilwr,</HI> (a mine near <HI>Holywell</HI>) in a close confined situation, and where the ore was of a particular hard nature. He was attacked annually, during fifteen or sixteen years, (usually in the spring) with an acute pain in the pit of his stomach, extending itself downwards, with a griping pain in the bowels; and attended with a violent reaching, vomiting, costiveness, and tenesmus. His bowels and abdominal muscles were much contracted, his pulse feeble and low, he was subject to cold clammy sweats, and an unusual coldness of his extremities. In the efforts to vomit, he some∣times
<PB N="129" REF="152"/>
parted with a quantity of bile; and in each evacuation I observed a deposition of a number of particles of lead, by parting with which he found great relief. The costiveness continued sometimes eight, nine, or ten days, notwithstanding the repeated use of purgatives, (chiefly castor-oil, in large doses, which I found to be the most effectual remedy). When this was got the better of, and a stool procured, I ob∣served in each evacuation a quantity of lead, by which, from the relief he obtained, his pulse became better, the contraction of his bowels disappeared, and likewise the cold clammy sweats. In three or four days, and in the two last attacks, he felt a similar acute pain in the lower part of his belly, attended with a scantiness, pain, and difficulty in voiding his urine. I consequently suspected that some leaden particles might have found their way into the bladder, and gave him some diuretic medicines, as balsam of <HI>copaiba, gum-arabic,</HI> and oil of juniper. In the course of twenty-four hours his urine was voided much easier, and in greater quantity, and he parted with as much pure lead by urine as would lie on a shilling. He in the latter part of his days became asthmatic, and weak, and died <HI>Nov.</HI> 30, 1754, in the 51st year of his age.</Q></P>
<P>I AM obliged to Mr. <HI>William Denman,</HI> of <HI>Holywell,</HI> surgeon, for the above account of the sad disorder; but more materially to his skill, and my excellent constitution, for a speedy recovery in the last spring (<HI>April</HI> 6th, 2 P. M.) from the con∣sequences of a knee-pan snapped in two transversely, by no other violence than by stepping down two steps instead of one. After a strict recumbency of near seven weeks in pos∣session
<PB N="130" REF="153"/>
of high spirits, fulness of faculties, and enjoyment of my favorite amusements, I rose from my bed, with the grateful pro∣spect of p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng the remainder of my days with my prior activity little impaired; thankful to PROVIDENCE for graciously adding this blessing to the numbers of others it has showered on me during my long and various life.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">CHERT.</NOTE>CHERT, which I have mentioned before, as being often the lodgement of the mineral veins, is the <HI>petrosilex,</HI> and <HI>lapis corneus,</HI> of <HI>Cronstedt,</HI> i. 189. It is of a flinty nature, and the only one of that class we have in our county. Nodular flints, the attendant on chalks, are quite unknown here. This is in the neighborhood of lime-stone, as flints are concomitant with chalk. It is an opaque stone, some∣times plain, often varied with stripes. I have spoken of it as a ma∣trix of the ores. I now consider it as useful in manufactures. It is frequently cut out of its quarries in great masses, and sent to the pottery countries of <HI>Staffordshire,</HI> first, for the purposes of form∣ing stones to grind and comminute the calcined flints, which are the great ingredients in the stone ware; and I think it is itself calcined, and being homogeneous with the purer flints, serves also for the same purposes. Much of it is found in the midst of our hills, sinking, as I have said, to depths unknown. In Sir <HI>Roger Mostyn</HI>'s land, near <HI>Pen-yr-allt,</HI> where the upper part of the pa∣rish hangs abrupt over the lower, it forms the broken precipitous front, and has been of late quarried out for exportation. Bishop <HI>Watson,</HI> (ii. 263) says, that it sells in <HI>Derbyshire</HI> at eight shillings ton. The duke of <HI>Rutland</HI> contents himself with five shillings <HI>per</HI> ton, as lord of the rock. The workmen have three shillings for raising. I leave the reader to consult the right reverend au∣thor
<PB N="131" REF="154"/>
for the process of calcining, &amp;c. The knowlege may be of use to my countrymen, whether it is any way related to the <HI>Petunse</HI> of the <HI>Chinese,</HI> p. 273. It may not be wrong to consult our late legatine voyagers to <HI>China</HI> for that purpose.</P>
<P>OUR lime-stone is a genuine marble, often pure,<NOTE PLACE="marg">LIME-STONE.</NOTE> often filled with <HI>entrochi</HI> and shells, composed entirely of homogeneous matter. I have mentioned the immensity of the beds: but it is often found mixed with calamine and ore. Its uses cannot be unknown to any, whether in building, whether for the purposes of agriculture. I am sensible its application is not extended as far as it ought to be; (but more of that under the article <HI>Rural Oeconomy.</HI>) Here I may say that it is the common flux used by the smelters in the fusing the lead ores; which has taken off much of the noxious effect it formerly had on the smelters, who were engaged in the operation, and on the cattle who fed on the grass within reach of the smoke.</P>
<P>ON the west side of <HI>Celyn</HI> rake, is a large stratum of a deep grey lime-stone, which, when calcined, makes, mixed with common lime, an excellent cement or terras, for works con∣structed in water. It is nearly equal to the <HI>Aberdour</HI> stone from <HI>South Wales,</HI> of which much has been imported for the uses of our great buildings on the <HI>Holywell</HI> stream.</P>
<P>OF spars we have in abundance the white opaque kind;<NOTE PLACE="marg">SPARS.</NOTE> but I think none of the fine refracting spars, or the <HI>Crystallum Islan∣dicum,</HI> which is frequent in the neighboring parishes.</P>
<P>PETROLEUM, rock-oil,<NOTE PLACE="marg">PETROLEUM.</NOTE> or what the <HI>Welsh</HI> call it <HI>y menin tyl∣with têg,</HI> or fairies butter, has been found in the lime-stone strata
<PB N="132" REF="155"/>
in our mineral country. It is a greasy substance, of an agreea∣ble smell; and I suppose ascribed to the benign part of those imaginary beings. It is esteemed serviceable in rheumatic cases, rubbed on the parts affected. It retains a place in our Dispensary.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">ADVENTI<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>OUS <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE>I SHALL just mention two or three adventitious bodies disco∣vered at vast depths in our mines. We have been often sur∣prised with finding great rude logs of timber, at the depth of twenty-five or forty-five yards under ground. They are quite rough, and totally freed from any suspicion of having been used in the mines, even had they not been met with in new or un∣worked ground, in blue clay, and amidst tumblers. They are firm and strong when first taken up, and of a black color, as if they had been burnt.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">SHELLS.</NOTE>SHELLS, especially <HI>conchae anomiae,</HI> are very common, some∣times loose, but more frequently immersed in the lime-stone.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">CHANGE OF STRATA.</NOTE>I NOW quit the heights, and go down a steep descent, about half a mile, into the lower part of the parish. The mouth of a level, and a shallow shaft near it, discovers the change of strata. The chert and the lime-stone quite disappear, and in their place appear first the beds of shale,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SHALE.</NOTE> black, shattery, and soon dissoluble when exposed to the weather. It is the symptom of approach∣ing coal, and the covering. <HI>Cronstedt,</HI> i. 259, calls it a pyrita∣ceous <HI>schistus,</HI> and gives it other epithets, according to its con∣tents. It is often found in beds of immense thickness, and often filled with inflammable air, which frequently bursts out to the great inconveniency and danger of the workmen. It is also im∣pregnated with bitumen, which adds to its powers. In many parts of the kingdom it is found to contain quantities of alum;<NOTE PLACE="marg">ALUM.</NOTE>
<PB N="133" REF="156"/>
and to be worked for the purpose of extracting from it that use∣ful article. The trial is worth making. In our parts we have the same advantages of coal for the process, and water-carriage for the exportation, as <HI>Whitby</HI> has. Coals begin to appear in their unprofitable beds, at a small distance to the east; half a mile further, in great bodies, and of an excellent quality.</P>
<P>THE collieries of <HI>Mostyn</HI> and <HI>Bychton</HI> have been worked for a very considerable space;<NOTE PLACE="marg">COLLIERIES.</NOTE> and in the last century supplied <HI>Dublin</HI> and the eastern side of <HI>Ireland</HI> with coals. They were discovered in the township of <HI>Mostyn,</HI> as early as the time of <HI>Edward</HI> I. as appears by an extent of that place, in the twenty-third year of that reign.</P>
<P>I REMEMBER many fluctuations in their state. They are now in the most flourishing which I ever remember, inferior only to that in which they were in the latter end of the late, and the be∣ginning of the present century. The rise of the collieries at <HI>White∣haven,</HI> which interfered with our trade to <HI>Dublin,</HI> was one cause of their decline; but another great cause was a natural one, the loss of the channel of the river <HI>Dee.</HI> We still load a few small vessels for the neighboring coasts of <HI>North Wales.</HI> But our pre∣sent prosperity arises from the great works of copper-plates, bolts, and sheathings for ships, and the works of brass established of late years near the town of <HI>Holywell.</HI> To them may be added the consumption occasioned by the increase of population, by the accession of the cotton manufactures; and, finally, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> vast quantities used for burning of lime, the effect of the happy in∣provement in agriculture, annually increasing for numbers of years. I do not mention our obligations to the numerous smelting-houses for lead, as they have been established among us, during time immemorial.</P>

<P>COALS were known to the <HI>Britons,</HI> before the arrival of the <HI>Romans,</HI> who had not even a name for them; yet <HI>Theo∣phrastus</HI> describes them very accurately, at lest three centuries before the time of <HI>Caesar;</HI> and even says that they were used by workers in brass. It is highly probable that the <HI>Britons</HI> made use of them. It is certain they had a primitive name for this fossil, that of <HI>Glo;</HI> and as a farther proof, I may add, that a flint-ax, the instrument of the <HI>aborigines</HI> of our island, was dis∣covered stuck in certain veins of coal, exposed to day in <HI>Craig y Parc,</HI> in <HI>Monmouthshire;</HI> and in such a situation as to render it very accessible to the unexperienced natives, who, in early times, were incapable of pursuing the veins to any great depths. The artless smelters of antient times made use of wood only in their operations, as we find among the reliques of their hearths.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">FREE-STONE.</NOTE>AT a short distance from the shale appear the beds of free-stone, first on the side of the dingle <HI>Nant y bi,</HI> and from thence above the coal, terminating in the cliffs in the parts of <HI>Tre Bych∣ton</HI> and <HI>Tre Mostyn,</HI> which are washed by the sea.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">BURNT ROCK.</NOTE>IN the township of <HI>Tre Mostyn,</HI> near the shore, is a cliff of a very singular appearance, looking like the semi-vitrified lava of a volcano. The stratum is in front universally changed in its disposition, and run into a horrible mass of red and black; often porous, in all parts very hard. In it is a hollow, a vein in which was lodged the pyritical matter that took fire, which continued burning by its own <HI>phlogiston,</HI> (see Bishop <HI>Watson,</HI> i. 167, to p. 200.) and caused the phenomenon. Its fury chiefly raged
<PB N="137" REF="161"/>
towards the front, and diminished gradually in the internal part of the bed; which, at some distance within land, appears only dis∣colored. The stratum is a sand-stone of the common sort (<HI>Da Costa's Fossils,</HI> 133.) I am informed, that these appearances are not uncommon in <HI>Derbyshire;</HI> and that Mr. <HI>Ferber,</HI> an ingenious <HI>Swede,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Whiteburst,</HI> our ingenious countryman, have taken notice of them in their writings.</P>
<P>I SHALL here introduce the mention of damps found in col∣lieries, which are not unfrequent,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A FIRE-DAMP.</NOTE> and sometimes act with amaz∣ing fury, and fatal consequences. There are two species, the suffocating, and the fire. The last is very rare in the lead-mines, unless in those parts where the <HI>shale,</HI> or stone attendant on coal, begins. The first kills instantaneously, by its mephitic vapor, and is a disaster common to neglected vaults, and draw-wells. The other is inflammable, and burns and destroys in a dreadful man∣ner, as the colliers, through negligence in not setting fire to the vapor before it gets to a head, do often experience. The most tremendous instance was on <HI>February</HI> 3d, 1675, in a coal-work at <HI>Mostyn,</HI> which I shall relate from the <HI>Philosophical Transactions;</HI> and so conclude the account of our mineral concerns.</P>
<P><Q>THE damp had been perceived for some time before, re∣sembling fiery blades, darting and crossing each other from both sides of the pit. The usual methods were taken to free the pit from this evil. After a cessation of work for three days, the steward, thinking to fetch a compass about from the eye of the pit that came from the day, and to bring wind by a secure way along with him, that, if it burst again, it may be done without danger of men's lives, went down, and took two men
<PB N="138" REF="162"/>
along with him, which served his turn for this purpose. He was no sooner down, but the rest of the workmen that had wrought there, disdaining to be left behind in such a time of danger, hasted down after them; and one of them, more indis∣creet than the rest, went headlong with his candle over the eye of the damp pit, at which the damp immediately catched, and flew up, to and fro, over all the hollows of the work, with a great wind, and a continual fire; and, as it went, keeping a mighty great roaring noise on all sides.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THE men, at first appearance of it, had most of them fallen upon their faces, and hid themselves as well as they could, in the loose slack, or small coal, and under the shelter of posts; yet nevertheless, the damp returning out of the hollows, and drawing towards the eye of the pit, it came up with incredible force; the wind and fire tore most of their clothes off their backs, and singed what was left, burning their faces and hands; the blasts falling so sharp on their skin, as if they had been whipt with cords. Some that had less shelter were carried fifteen or sixteen yards from their first station, and beaten against the roof of the coal, and sides of the posts, and lay afterwards a good while senseless, so that it was long before they could hear or find one another. As it drew up to the day-pit, it caught one of the men along with it that was next to the eye; and up it comes, with such a terrible crack, not unlike, but more shrill, than a cannon, that was heard fifteen miles off, with the wind, and such a pillar of smoke as darkened all the sky over-head for a good while. The brow of the hill above the pit was eighteen yards high, and on it grew trees of fourteen or fifteen
<PB N="139" REF="163"/>
yards long; yet the man's body, and other things from the pit, were seen above the tops of the highest trees, at lest 100 yards. On this pit stood a horse-engine, of substantial timber, and strong iron-work; on which lay a trunk, or barrel, for winding the rope up and down, of above 1000 pounds weight; it was then in motion, one bucket going down, and the other coming up full of water. This trunk was fastened to that frame with locks and bolts of iron; yet it was thrown up, and carried a good way from the pit; and pieces of it, though bound with iron hoops and strong nails, blown into the woods about; so like∣wise were the two buckets; and the ends of the rope, after the buckets were blown from them, stood awhile upright in the air like pikes, and then came leisurely drilling down. The whole frame of the engine was stirred and moved out of its place; and those men's clothes, caps, and hats, that escaped, were afterwards found shattered to pieces, and thrown amongst the woods a great way from the pit.</Q></P>
<P>ANOTHER of these damps happened in the same lands within my memory. In the year 1751,<NOTE PLACE="marg">ANOTHER IN 1751.</NOTE> one man was beat to pieces in the bottom of the pit. Two others were taken up alive, but died soon after; and two others survived, but were most dread∣fully burnt: and one who is now living, remains a dreadful evi∣dence of the effects of the damp. All his fingers burnt off, and his visage terribly disfigured.</P>
<P>I SHALL here describe agitations of the earth derived from other causes, which,<NOTE PLACE="marg">EARTHQUAKES.</NOTE> dreadful as they have been in distant coun∣tries, have here occasioned little more than a momentary alarm. I have at this house felt four shocks of the earthquake. I shall
<PB N="140" REF="164"/>
relate their effects, from the <HI>Philosophical Transactions,</HI> in which they are recorded. On <HI>April</HI> 2d, 1750, between the hours of ten and eleven at night, I was greatly alarmed with a violent shock of an earthquake. I, who was in bed, was frequently moved up and down; and the bed, having castors, was removed some small space from its proper situation.</P>
<P>DURING the shock, a great noise was heard in the air; and, some nights before, lights were seen in the sky; such as were previous to the earthquake in town.</P>
<P>I HAVE summed up the remainder in a letter to Sir <HI>Joseph Banks,</HI> baronet, K. B. which had the honor of being read before the ROYAL SOCIETY, on <HI>January</HI> 25th, following, and afterwards printed in the <HI>Transactions,</HI> vol. lxxi. p. 193.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Downing,</HI>
<DATE><HI>Dec.</HI> 12, 1781.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>It is very singular, that in three days after my return home, I should be reminded of my promise by a repetition of the very phenomenon on which I had engaged to write to you: for on <HI>Saturday</HI> last, between four and five in the evening, we were alarmed with two shocks of an earthquake; a slight one, im∣mediately followed by another very violent. It seemed to come from the north-east, and was preceded by the usual noise. At present I cannot trace it farther than <HI>Holywell.</HI></P>
<P>THE earthquake preceding this was on the 29th of <HI>August,</HI> 1780, about a quarter before nine in the morning. I was fore∣warned of it by a rumbling noise, not unlike the coming of a great waggon into my court-yard. Two shocks immediately followed, which were strong enough to terrify us. They came
<PB N="141" REF="165"/>
from the north-west; were felt in <HI>Anglesea,</HI> at <HI>Caernarvon, Llan∣rwst,</HI> in the vale of <HI>Clwyd</HI> south of <HI>Denbigh,</HI> at this house, and in <HI>Holywell;</HI> but I could not discover that their force extended any farther.</P>
<P>THE next, in this retrograde way of enumerating these pheno∣mena, was on the 8th <HI>September,</HI> 1775, about a quarter before ten at night. The noise was such as preceded the former; and the shock so violent as to shake the bottles and glasses on the table round which myself and some company were sitting. This seemed to come from the east. I see in the <HI>Gentleman's Maga∣zine</HI> of that year, that this shock extended to <HI>Shropshire,</HI> and quite to <HI>Bath,</HI> and to <HI>Swansea</HI> in <HI>South Wales.</HI></P>
<P>THE earliest earthquake I remember here was on the 10th of <HI>April,</HI> 1750. It has the honor of being recorded in the <HI>Philo∣sophical Transactions;</HI> therefore I shall not trouble you with the repetition of what I have said.</P>
<P>PERMIT me to observe, that I live near a mineral country, in a situation between lead-mines and coal-mines; in a sort of neutral tract, about a mile distant from the first, and half a mile from the last. On the strictest inquiry I cannot discover that the miners or colliers were ever sensible of the shocks under ground: nor have they ever perceived, when the shocks in question have happened, any falls of the loose and shattery strata, in which the last especially work; yet, at the same time, the earthquakes have had violence sufficient to terrify the inha∣bitants of the surface.</P>
<P>TO this observation I may add, that no eruptions of water were ever observed to follow the shocks; no water from the vast
<PB N="142" REF="166"/>
reservoirs of that element, formed in the deserted pits, which have often burst through the hollow which contained them, and more than once drowned the unhappy colliers who have been working beneath.</P>
<P>I HAVE seen in prints an observation of some gentleman learned in earthquakes, that the cause of those I have mentioned, which leave the shattery strata of the coal-mines unaffected, to have been electricity, which in these instances moved equally and gently, so as not to cause any concussion, or to go perhaps far below the surface, so that they leave the worked depths totally untouched.</P>
<P>NONE of these earthquakes were local; for, excepting the first, all may be traced to very remote parts. The weather was remarkable still at the time of every earthquake I have felt.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>I remain with true regard, &amp;c. <HI>T. P.</HI></SIGNED></CLOSER>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">QUADRUPEDS.</NOTE>THE quadrupeds of this parish are common to many parts of <HI>England.</HI> Yet I shall give a catalogue of them in our antient tongue, and affix to them those in the <HI>English.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. IN respect to the <HI>March, Ceffyl,</HI> the horse, the <HI>caseg</HI> or mare, <HI>dispaidd-farch</HI> or gelding, there are abundance in our parish, used chiefly in the carriage of coal, and our mineral wealth; but as to fine large black horses used in the coach, and by the richer farmers, scarcely any are bred in our parish, but numbers are bought from those of <HI>Northop, Mold,</HI> and <HI>Hope,</HI> in our county, which are far from a disgrace to the gentleman's equipage.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="143" REF="167"/>2. THE <HI>mûl,</HI> or mule, is very rare with us; but the</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Asyn,</HI> or ass, is in great plenty, used by the poor to carry coal, to ease themselves of part of the expence of turnpike. It for∣merly was applied for the carriage of ore; but since the improve∣ment in our roads, has been quite lain aside for that purpose.</P>
<P N="4">4. THE <HI>tarw,</HI> bull; <HI>buwch,</HI> cow; <HI>ych, eidion,</HI> ox; <HI>llo,</HI> calf, or whatsoever goes under the general adopted name of <HI>cattal,</HI> or more properly <HI>gwarthag,</HI> or cattle, produces nothing worthy of note in <HI>Whiteford</HI> parish. Neither cheese nor butter for sale made from their milk, excepting for family consumption. There is only one ox-team in the parish; but that is a remarkably fine one. It is the property of Sir <HI>Roger Mostyn,</HI> and used on his noble demesn, which is kept in admirable order. I must not conceal, that Sir <HI>Roger</HI> would be the best farmer in the parish, if he was permitted to have his own way: but no one can be ignorant of the tenacity of servants to old customs, and the difficulty of over∣coming ingrafted obstinacy.</P>
<P N="5">5. THE <HI>hwrdd, maharen,</HI> or ram; <HI>dafad,</HI> ewe; <HI>oen,</HI> lamb. Sheep in general are not greatly cultivated in our parish: many in∣deed are turned out by the farmers on <HI>Tegen-mountain,</HI> but the gentry chiefly buy their stock for the table from <HI>Llangollen</HI> and other places.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>Bwch,</HI> the he-goat; <HI>gafr,</HI> the female; <HI>myn,</HI> the kid, are very little favored, even in the county at large. I keep a few on my mountain <HI>Glol,</HI> for the sake of any invalids who may want their restoring milk.</P>

<P>THE <HI>long-tailed tit-mouse, Br. Zool.</HI> i. N<SUP>o</SUP> 166, with its numerous brood, passes annually through my garden. They flit from tree to tree, as if on their progress to some other place, never making any halt.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Nut-cracker, Br. Zool.</HI> ii. App. tab. iii. <HI>Latham,</HI> i. p. 400, is an accidental visitant of this island. One was killed in the gar∣den at <HI>Mostyn</HI> in 1753. On the continent it extends from <HI>Ger∣many</HI> to <HI>Kamtschatka,</HI> and inhabits the vast forests of pines. It also nestles on lofty towers, and, like the jackdaw, is very noisy. In size it is about equal to that bird. Its colour is rusty brown, prettily marked with triangular spots of pure white. It feeds on nuts (which it breaks with its bill) also on fir-cones, acorns, ber∣ries, and insects. Its bill is as strong as that of the wood-pecker, which enables it to pierce the bodies of trees, and make great havock among the timber.</P>
<P>VAST numbers of water-fowls frequent our shores in the win∣ter time, chiefly ducks and wigeons. In very severe weather, variety of others emigrate here; but none excepting those which accidentally visit every other maritime part of <HI>Great Britain.</HI></P>
<P>I SHALL conclude this mention of the birds with an account of a singular accident discovered in a turkey which was killed for my table. The cook in plucking it found herself much wounded in the fingers. On examining the cause, it was found, that from the thigh-bone of the bird issued a short upright process, and to that grew a large and strong talon, with a sharp and crooked
<PB N="148" REF="173"/>
claw, exactly resembling that of a bird of prey. Every head was set to work to explain the cause of this wondrous pheno∣me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n. The effects of fright, of conceit on the minds of the female, human and brute, in the state of pregnancy, was then considered, and all the various instances of monstrous produc∣tions. I have heard of a duckling, which, to the surprize of a g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ave family, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> from its n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st with a long serpentine tail instead of its natural rump. This was readily resolved into a fright the mother-duck took, at finding, when it went once to lay, a snake coiled up in the nest, as was a real fact. I consulted the learned, but found the doctrine of terror and fancy totally exploded. I then consulted the Memoirs of the Royal Academy of Sciences at <HI>Brobdingnag;</HI> and, to my inexpressible satisfaction, found that the opinion of that illustrious body coincided with my own: so I put down this uncommon accident as no more than a <HI>Relpium Sca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cath,</HI> or, in the modern phrase, a <HI>lusus naturae.</HI></P>

<P>THE waters of this parish are very numerous,<NOTE PLACE="marg">WATERS.</NOTE> as is the case of all mountanous tracts.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">WHITEFORD STREAM.</NOTE>THE stream of most utility rises from a spring a little beyond the village of <HI>Whiteford.</HI> It runs by my house, and is no small ornament to my ground. It turns my two mills, which, with much patriotism and little wisdom, I erected. The first is near the <HI>Gwibnant</HI> or <HI>Wibnant,</HI> and made in form of a chapel. My great folly is about half a mile lower: is an excellent mill, and does much business for the lessee. This stream is much augmented by an∣other, which rises at a place called <HI>Saith Ffynnan,</HI> or <HI>the Seven Wells,</HI> and murmurs through the romantic <HI>Nant-y-bi,</HI> and unites with it at the <HI>Wibnant.</HI> It concludes its course near <HI>Llanerch-y-môr</HI> smelting-house, to which it is of great use, by setting in
<PB N="157" REF="182"/>
motion some stampers for comminuting the slags before they are committed to the hearth for the extraction of the remaining lead.</P>
<P>THE last stream runs through <HI>Felyn Blwm,</HI> or <HI>the lead-mill,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">FELYN BLWM.</NOTE> a great romantic dingle which divides this parish from that of <HI>Llan-Asaph.</HI> Near its fall into the sea is a considerable mill, the property of Sir <HI>Roger Mostyn.</HI> This dingle probably takes its name from the number of antient smelting-hearths for lead found in it, in use in the primaeval artless times of smelting.</P>
<P>ALL our dingles run parallel to each other,<NOTE PLACE="marg">NATURE OF THE DINGLES.</NOTE> and begin at some distance from the first or steepest descent from the mountain. The sides of all are cloathed with oaks, and each has its rill at the bottom. These great ravines, I may call them, were evi∣dently formed on the running down of the waters of the deluge on its subsidence, when they found their way to what the AL∣MIGHTY determined should ever remain a circum-ambient sea.</P>
<P>NUMBERS of the small springs which arise in the lower part of the parish shew symptoms of the internal contents.<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHALYBEATE SPRINGS.</NOTE> In the neighborhood of the coal, they are covered with a dirty yellow ochreous scum; and are more or less chalybeate. One, which rises before my house, is strongly so, and proved very beneficial to the only person I know who made a fair use of it.</P>
<P>IN respect to the husbandry of this parish;<NOTE PLACE="marg">HUSBANDRY.</NOTE> it may be di∣vided into several parts. I shall first pay attention to the higher or the mountanous. That tract is very extensive,<NOTE PLACE="marg">MOUNTAIN GROUND.</NOTE> covered in general with heath mixed with coarse grass. The climate very cold in comparison of the lower parts. We often find during
<PB N="158" REF="183"/>
winter a severe frost reign there, when the ground has been quite soft, and the air mild, in the lower parts.</P>
<P>THE soil in general a poor loam, and in many parts very thin; in others, the lime-stone pervades the stratum, and forms large tracts of rock. There are certain parts fit for agriculture, as has been found by the surreptitious inclosures made in a few parts, which yield corn, such as barley and oats, in a kindly manner. I wish experiments were made of planting part; which, if put under the care of a woodman, might be a national benefit, as well as a private one to the lord of the manor. The neglect of appointing woodmen would render the planting of no effect, by reason of the variety of trespasses; as we free-holders of the lower parts, who make our woods the glory of our estates, do daily and cruelly experience.</P>
<P>OUR mountains support some black-cattle; the greater part of which are left out the whole year to take their chance. Still the high country is a nursery. Many are sent lean to market, and drove to more genial soils. Most of our farmers fatten cattle, and either sell them to the butchers for the <HI>Holywell</HI> market, or to those of <HI>Chester</HI> and <HI>Leverpool.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">SHEEP.</NOTE>THE sheep are numerous. They likewise are left to them∣selves; and become in hard weather great nusances by their trespasses on the cultivated lands of us low-landers. As may be imagined, they produce little wool. Their fleeces are coarse, yet of that a small quantity is sold into <HI>Merionethshire,</HI> and the rest manufactured at home, and made either into cloth for the country people, or into flannel for the women, or knit into stockings, all for home consumption. In respect to mutton, much
<PB N="159" REF="184"/>
is brought to market from the mountains, but that is only during the vigorous part of the summer, and after the frost or rainy sea∣son: but the greatest part of the sheep bought by the gentry for the table, is purchased at the distant country fairs.</P>
<P>NUMBERS of hogs are bred in our parish;<NOTE PLACE="marg">HOGS.</NOTE> and numbers are sold at the fairs, and driven to distant parts.</P>
<P>THE soil of the lower part of the parish is in general a very stiff clay, which continues quite to the edge of the cliff,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SOILS.</NOTE><NOTE PLACE="marg">CLAY.</NOTE> above the shore. In many places are spots of gravel, but of very small extent. We have also beds of pure sand, but that useful arti∣cle is in most parts scarce.</P>
<P>FROM the <HI>Rhewl</HI> to <HI>Avon Marsh Siambr</HI> is a thin vein of very rich marle, saponaceous to the touch; prettily veined with red, grey, and white. It is got in too small quantities for use. On the edge of the mountain, especially on the tenement of <HI>Plâs Captain,</HI> is a larger vein of a coarser kind. The tenant, <HI>Thomas Blore,</HI> a <HI>Cheshire</HI> man, conversant in this species of manure, has made a judicious application of it on his farm, and as long as it lasted reaped the reward of his industry.</P>
<P>BEYOND the space between the boundary and the mountain is a tract of light soil, which may be said to begin under <HI>Kelyn,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">LICHTER SOIL.</NOTE> in the township of <HI>Uchlan,</HI> and continue in a direct line by <HI>Tyddin Ycha,</HI> to <HI>Plas Ycha,</HI> in the township of <HI>Mostyn.</HI> This is extremely well adapted for that useful root the turnep; and it has been tried with success. But the farmer is obliged to give up the cultiva∣tion, by reason of the depredations the poor make on the crops. They will steal the turneps before his face, laugh at him when he fumes at them; and ask him, how he can be in such a rage about a few turneps? As a magistrate, I never had a complaint made before
<PB N="160" REF="185"/>
me against a turnep-stealer. Our farmers, and our coal-adven∣turers, have not yet 'plucked the old woman out of their hearts,' for the last suffer likewise in a great degree in their trade, yet hardly complain. Incredible as it may appear, numbers of them are in fear of being cursed at St. <HI>Aelian</HI>'s well, (see my <HI>Tour in Wales,</HI> vol. ii. p. 337) and suffer the due penalty of their superstition.</P>
<P>AT uncertain seasons clouds of ring-doves, wood-pigeons or queests, winter-migrants from <HI>Scandinavia,</HI> have visited our turnep-fields, and done no small damage to the crops.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">POTATOES.</NOTE>EVERY cottage has its garden; and if that is not large enough, any landlord or neighbor allots him a piece in one of his fields, for the purpose of a potatoe-garden, and this spot is prepared and manured by the landlord, and for which not more than 18 <HI>d.</HI> per rood is demanded. The last comfort is not of long date, for I can remember the time in which it was almost unknown to the poorer people; neither did the rich extend the culture beyond the garden. How singular does appear to us the following quotation from old <HI>Gerard,</HI> p. 928, who speaks of it as
<Q>being also a meate for pleasure, equall in goodnesse and whole∣somenesse vnto the same, being either rosted in the embers, or boyled and eaten with oyle, vinegar, and pepper, or dressed any other way by the hand of some cunning in cookerie.</Q>
—At pre∣sent our gardeners, and a few others of the parish, raise sufficient to supply their neighbors, and to carry for sale to the adjacent market. The stiff soil of the parish is unfavorable to the cul∣ture. If we want potatoes in any quantities, we must import them from the vaie of <HI>Conwy,</HI> from <HI>Cheshire,</HI> and <HI>Lancashire.</HI> In the present time of scarcity, (<HI>May</HI> 1795) the cultivation
<PB N="161" REF="186"/>
has been unusually encreased in <HI>Whiteford</HI> parish. Before this season, I never raised more than was necessary for the use of my family: this year I increased my potatoe-ground many-fold, even before I had read the speech made by Sir <HI>John Sinclair.</HI> Thousands have done the same in a similar state of ignorance, some from benevolence, some from view of gain, and others on the principle of self-preservation. I may predict also, from the former motives, that wheat will be in the next season sown four∣fold. Admonitions surely are unnecessary. In the next year we may rejoice in plenty, even in superfluity, and have the happiness of seeing the poor man exult in our success.—But the <HI>halcyon</HI> days are arriving fast. Let us comfort ourselves with the fair prospect before us, and devoutly pray for the accom∣plishment of those hopes delivered to us in the following pro∣phetic effusions:
<Q><L>Let us cut off those legal bars</L>
<L>Which crush the culture of our fertile isle!</L>
<L>Were they remov'd, unbounded wealth would flow,</L>
<L>Our wastes would then with varied produce smile,</L>
<L>And <HI>England</HI> soon a second <HI>Eden</HI> prove?</L></Q></P>
<P>WHEAT grows remarkably well in our clayey land;<NOTE PLACE="marg">WHEAT.</NOTE> it is the red kind, that the farmer prefers for seed; it is the hardiest, and the surest of finding sale; the white and the grey being in our country less in request. We raise much more than the parish would consume. The rest is exported to <HI>Leverpool,</HI> to supply the county of <HI>Lancashire</HI> with bread, that vast county not being pro∣ductive of much wheat. The demand, therefore, from the nu∣merous populous towns is very considerable, and at times occa∣sions a great rise in the price, and a consequential clamor at home. The complaints are the draining of our county of grain, and the imaginary evil of great farms. Grain is one of the ar∣ticles of commerce of the parish; and weaving the support of
<PB N="162" REF="187"/>
thousands and thousands of poor in the great county I have men∣tioned. We feed them, they supply us with various species of cloathing. As to food, let me add, that the farmers of that county even make us a return in that article; for they supply us with potatoes, as we do them with wheat. We all depend upon one another: so true is it, that
<Q>GOD never form'd an independant man<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></Q>
Without such means of sale, or, we may call it, exchange of commodities, the great farmer would cease to plough, would cease to form those magazines of corn, on which, at all times, our markers depend, and which are the great preservative from famine in these kingdoms. At times, bad seasons occasion bad crops, and of course enhance the price. An inordinate lust of gain may sometimes occasion criminal confederacies; which, criminal as they are, have hitherto baffled every attempt of the legis∣lature to prevent. The poor are now left quite defenceless against the iniquitous race of <HI>forestallers,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c. by the repeal of the 5th and 6th <HI>Edw.</HI> VI. It is much to be lamented that those humane laws are not revived, modified in any manner adapted to the times. A middle man in great contracts is often requisite: it is not that description of men at whom I aim, but those who in small bargains tempt the farmer, by offers of exor∣bitant prices, and contribute to the distresses of the poor, and discontents of the country, to a degree unspeakable. At present a calamitous war assists that evil; but surely we cannot grudge food to our brave countrymen, who are fighting for all that is dear to us. Among them we may have neighbors, sons of tenants, our own sons, or different relations: to whom, if we think a moment, we should be ashamed to deny a share in the produce of the labor of their native country, in which it is possible they themselves might have bore a share.</P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="188"/>SUPPOSING all farms are reduced to an equality, and all made small ones, the ground must be divided into little portions for the support of a miserable team, or of a few cows, or for raising small quantities of corn. No magazines could be formed against evil days; the produce of the dairy would be small, and the provision for fodder serve for little more than to support the live stock. A few hobbets <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A hobbet consists of 84 quarts. A measure is half a hobbet. A peck is half a measure. These measures are used in all the <HI>Flintshire</HI> markets; they ex∣tend also to other <HI>Welsh</HI> counties, and even <HI>Herefordshire.</HI></NOTE> of corn would be sent to market to pay the rent; the rest might serve to maintain the family till the return of the harvest: and if the stock should be consumed before that season, how would they wish for the restoring of the great farms! Many of the little farmers are also day-laborers: to whom could they apply for work, the very support of them and their families? NEVER HAS THERE BEEN A FAMINE IN ENG∣LAND SINCE THE INTRODUCTION OF GREAT FARMS. Unavoidable scarcities will happen, from causes inevitable. But there has not been an instance, for numbers of centuries, of the poor running into corners to die for want of food; of their seeing their infants perish before their eyes; and perhaps a plague might ensue, the consequence of famine, to thin the land of multitudes of the mi∣serable survivors.</P>
<P>I SPEAK disinterestedly, for I have not on my estate a single great farmer. I find no merit in this assertion; had it been otherwise, I should have supported him in all that was right, in common with my poorest tenant, and my poorest tenant perhaps in pre∣ference to him.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="189"/>I WOULD never grant a lease to a great corn-tenant. I would preserve a power over his granary, which legislature will not or cannot assume. Should he attempt by exportation to exhaust it, in years of scarcity, and not leave a sufficient supply for the country which produced the grain; should he attempt a monopoly; should he refuse to carry a proper quantity to the next market; or should he refuse to sell to the poor, who cannot attend the market, corn in small quantities, I would instantly assume the power of the landlord, and expel him from my estate: a just pu∣nishment for the tenant, who, through rapacity, declines to com∣ply with my desires, excited with no other view than to promote the good of the public.</P>
<P>THE necessity of great farms is admitted; but let it be re∣membered, that their support rests upon the laborers, who are equally requisite to the great farmer as beams are to a building. Let not the rapacity of the miscalled great man direct all his force to the support of the opulent farmer, for the sake of in∣creased rent. He will (as sad examples prove) depopulate his country by removing the sturdy laborers to the ground of wiser landlords, and leave his own weakened by their desertion; while the fields of the former laugh and sing, but round his own, <HI>ingens <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it solitudo.</HI></P>
<P>I COULD wish (was it in my power) to add even to the cot∣tages of my laborers two or three small fields, that they might have the comfort of a cow, to supply their families with milk. They are too useful a class of men to be neglected: to be left to the precarious possibility of getting any of that invigorating fluid, so necessary for their infants, and even for the support of their
<PB N="165" REF="190"/>
own strength, to sustain them through their labor. Give them a dry <HI>stated</HI> cottage, with an upper floor, and a kind landlord, and a <HI>British</HI> laborer need not envy <HI>Caesar.</HI></P>
<P>BEFORE I take leave of the subject, let me define the size of a great and a small farm in this parish. Our greatest farm is rented at £. 110 <HI>per ann.</HI> at the rate of about 14 <HI>s. per</HI> acre. Our small farms have from 20 to 10 acres; and the rent <HI>per</HI> acre from 12 <HI>s.</HI> to 7 <HI>s.</HI> There may be in every parish instances of the exorbi∣tant raise of rent: an evil most frequently originating in the luxury of the landlord. Our rents are moderate, because our gentry would blush to add one dish to their table at the expence of the tenant. Mr. <HI>Wedge,</HI> in his <HI>Survey of Cheshire,</HI> p. 72, speaks humanely and sensibly on the affected maxim of
<Q>high rents being a spur to industry.</Q>
This (for I must help Mr. <HI>Wedge</HI> with a simile) resembles the practice of the prudent planter, who wishes to quicken the industry of his negroes by the invigorating appli∣cation of the cart-whip to their velvet skin.</P>
<P>IN respect to leases, the utility is not perfectly agreed on. In our parts of <HI>North Wales</HI> I have known lease-tenants of very mo∣derate rent continue on their farms their whole term without suc∣cess: and I know in this parish, and within a small distance, seve∣ral rack-rent tenants, with large farms, the most prosperous of any in the country. They improve boldly, and reap amply the fruits of their industry. They have confidence in their landlords, nor can they recollect more than one instance (and that indeed disgrace∣ful enough <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Survey of North Wales, <HI>article</HI> Denbighshire, <HI>p. 17.</HI></NOTE>) in which they found it misplaced. They are masters
<PB N="166" REF="191"/>
of the knowlege of the soil, and the nature of the climate of their own country. The appearance of their tenements does them credit. When they heard of a person sent among them to inculcate the principles of good farming, they smiled at the design, but spoke with gratitude of the kind intent of the <HI>Board of Agriculture. Denbighshire</HI> has long had its little board, for <HI>North Wales</HI> does not neglect its own interests. An agricultural society has, for a number of years, been estabished in the vale of <HI>Clwyd.</HI> None who have visited that beautiful tract can deny the general excellency of its culture.</P>
<P>IN <HI>Cheshire</HI> the antient practice of leasing is growing fast out of use: and agriculture will increase in that county in proportion.</P>
<P>MR. <HI>George Kay,</HI> of <HI>Leith,</HI> the missionary to whom was commit∣ted the inspection of every farm in the six counties of <HI>North Wales,</HI> favored me with a call some time in the last summer, and delivered to me his credentials from Sir <HI>John Sinclair.</HI> I was really at the time out of spirits. At the same time, a report was circulated, that the object of the mission was to ascertain the reality of our land-tax; which was much credited by my coun∣trymen. I was certain that the report was entirely unfounded; but I did not chuse to trouble myself with militating against what I knew must speedily become self-confuted. I treated Mr. <HI>Kay</HI> with all civility. He left me, and I believe, through all his journey, (one place excepted) had no reason to complain of the reception he met with. Sir <HI>John Sinclair</HI> is a man of honor. He had not the lest occasion to give himself the trouble of making to me so earnest an asseveration of the purity of his intentions, as he did in his last favor. He is above taking clandestine means of getting at any kind of information.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="192"/>WE lament that Mr. <HI>Kay</HI> did not see, in any one of our six counties, a single custom that could be useful to others <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hints for Improvements in North Wales, <HI>p. 40.</HI></NOTE>. From the state of numbers of our farms, I suspect that we had pre∣viously adopted many methods of agriculture from <HI>English</HI> coun∣ties, which must have occasioned his remark. I would fain pay that compliment to his candour. On the whole, I fear that the mission has passed most unprofitably to both <HI>visitor</HI> and <HI>visitè.</HI> Nothing seems to have been learned by the one, and nothing taught by the other.</P>
<P>WE thatch our hay-ricks with admirable neatness, and in that manner preserve the hay for years. I do not know a better expedient, even could the landlord afford to every little farm a hay-barn, or give them a moveable canopy, which is liable per∣petually to be out of order. Necessity in every country causes different modes of oeconomy. Send <HI>Shenkin ap Morgan</HI> on a survey of <HI>Cathness,</HI> and he would at first stare at the <HI>bykes</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Tour in Scotland,</HI> 1769. 3d ed. p. 201.</NOTE>, but would admire the ingenuity of the contrivances, and acknowlege the wisdom of the farmer in the preservation of his grain, where other means were wanting.</P>
<P>THERE are, certainly, both beyond the <HI>Tweed,</HI> and beyond the <HI>Dee,</HI> many thousands of acres, of which a tenant should be court∣ed to attempt the cultivation, and be bribed by leases to settle upon them. In <HI>North Britain</HI> the practice is common. In <HI>North Wales,</HI> our mountain landlords rarely grant leases, possibly from their not finding the necessity.</P>
<P>IN all the mineral part of <HI>Flintshire</HI> are numbers of small farms, tenanted by carriers, who entirely support themselves by the
<PB N="168" REF="193"/>
carriage of the lead ore, and calamine or coal. These are reck∣oned the most slovenly farmers we have. They apply them∣selves to carriage to such a degree, as to neglect their tenements. The minerals are the great natural staple of this, and most of the parishes; so that these species of farms are quite indispensable.</P>
<P>LET not the little farmer, or the cottager, repine at the wealth of the great farmers. It is not many weeks since their empty stomachs have been filled from the hoards of the latter. Had they not been able to form a stock, or to enable by sale others to do so, what would have become of you? The good, the bene∣volent, have been able to purchase from them the food that has contributed to preserve, for many months, you and your's from cruel want. The instances of the recent charities have not been equalled. I may speak of the universal charities. But I will recal to your minds those of your several neighborhoods. In public calamities little souls lie squat in their holes: great souls arise, and are called forth to action; some from a generous sensibi∣lity, others from selfish motives. I cannot but confess myself to be among the latter. I am selfish enough to wish to put out my money at lest on reversionary interest, but that on security incontestible.
<Q>HE THAT HATH PITY ON THE POOR LENDETH TO THE LORD; AND LOOK WHAT HE LAYETH OUT, IT SHALL BE PAID TO HIM AGAIN!</Q>
With what animated benevolence of sentiment doth Sir <HI>Thomas Broune</HI> comment on this pious exhortation! 'There is,' says the great physician of <HI>Norwich,</HI>
<Q>more rhetoric in that one sentence than in a library of sermons; and, indeed, if those sentences were understood by the reader, with the same em∣phasis as they were delivered by the Author, we needed not those volumes of instructions, but might be honest by epitome.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="194"/>THE produce of the wheat of this parish is from seven and eight fold, to twelve or thirteen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">PRODUCE OF WHEAT.</NOTE> according to the pains taken with the ground, or the nature of it. Our general manure is lime, burnt in sod-kilns. The lime-stone, broken small,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SOD-KILNS.</NOTE> is placed within a thick circular wall of sods, and the strata of stone, broken small, interlaid with beds of coal, which is set on fire by wood placed in certain holes left at the sides. These holes serve likewise to ad∣mit the air, which promotes the fierceness of the fire within. The lime-stones are piled in a conic form, to a great height above the top of the sod-wall, and then covered thickly with sods. I must mention that the holes are four in number, placed opposite to each other, and have a gutter cut from one to the other, which is left hollow by means of flat stones over them, to promote the current of air. A circular gutter also runs close to the interior side of the sod wall. A common-sized kiln will require about sixteen tons of stone: but there are larger, and those often of an oval form.</P>
<P>SOMETIMES the lime-stone is burnt in common kilns, then taken and carried to form a compost with earth, which had been deposited in some adjacent place, and which usually had been dug out of old ditches. The lime is intimately mixed with it, and left a considerable time to mature, after which it is applied to use.</P>
<P>OUR best barley is raised in the light soil which we have men∣tioned at p. 159.<NOTE PLACE="marg">BARLEY.</NOTE> In general our farmers prepare the ground for barley by giving it a fallow in <HI>December</HI> or <HI>January,</HI> and again harrow and plough it the latter end of <HI>April</HI> or beginning of <HI>May.</HI> In the stiffer lands the crops are frequently very un∣favorable.
<PB N="170" REF="195"/>

Clover (the red sort) which we sow immediately after the barley.<NOTE PLACE="marg">CLOVER.</NOTE> When the clover is sowen by itself, or without any other grass-seeds, the quantity to each acre is eighteen or twenty pounds. It is not a favorite grass, but we do not know how to remedy ourselves. It wears out in less than three years, after which we renew the ground with a crop of wheat, managed as before related. The clover-seed is procured from the vale of <HI>Clwyd,</HI> and other places where the plant is culti∣vated for the sake of the seed.</P>

<P>I VALUE myself on being the first in this parish who introduced on my estate the husbandry of draining and flooding, which I did last autumn, and throughout the winter, on a great number of acres. I did intend to desist from working after <HI>Christmas,</HI> had I not been induced to continue it throughout the season, in consi∣deration of the numbers of poor people who were in the deepest distress for want o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> employ. The season was so rigorous, that the laborers were obliged to break into the unfrozen ground with the pick-ax, before they could use the spade. This, and the short days, made the work very expensive: but I was far
<PB N="171" REF="196"/>
over-paid by the consideration of having given food to mul∣titudes, who in themselves or their families must otherwise have labored under the greatest difficulties. The undertaker was Mr. <HI>Henry Harrison,</HI> who followed the most approved practice. I flatter myself that in the ensuing year I shall experience the effects of his skill.</P>
<P>To clear the free-holders of <HI>Whiteford</HI> parish from any inatten∣tion to that important article of husbandry, planting,<NOTE PLACE="marg">PLANTING.</NOTE> I bring the brief, but irresistible, defence of—the impossibility. The dingles are filled with oaks. I believe there is not one of us have any waste ground for the purpose. All our tenements consist of arable or pasture land, too valuable to be spared for any other purpose in this populous parish. Sir <HI>Roger Mostyn,</HI> on his coming to his estate, planted the little that had been cleared by his predecessor. Besides <HI>Mostyn</HI> or <HI>Whiteford</HI> wood (see p. 25) many of our very hedges are filled with oaks: possibly they do not benefit our land by their shade, but a few of us are true <HI>druids;</HI> and should we apply the ax, we should imagine that we heard the groans of the <HI>Hamadryads</HI> at every stroke.</P>
<P>I AM, in particular, so very avaricious of my woods, that at this instant of writing, I, with true reluctance, sign to my son the death-warrant of a few stag-horned trees, that have far outlived the best of their days. They, in all probability, would have had a re∣spite, could I move from my couch to take a look at my antient favorites. But the void space shall be instantly inclosed, and, I may promise, that in a short time it will be filled with the best of successors, self-sown, from some of their own descendants, their eldest and most sturdy progeny.</P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="197"/><NOTE PLACE="marg">SIR EDWARD LLOYD, A GREAT PLANTER.</NOTE>IF we of <HI>Whiteford</HI> parish are deprived of the possibility of planting within its limits, yet we can boast of a <HI>Flintshire</HI> gentle∣man, who probably will be found to have contributed as a planter more to the benefit of his heir and of the state, than any other in the principality, in this age, or any past. I mean Sir <HI>Edward Lloyd,</HI> bart. of <HI>Pengwern,</HI> in the parish of <HI>St. Asaph,</HI> who finished his long and useful life on <HI>May</HI> the 26th of the present year.

<HEAD>HISTORY OF <HI>HOLYWELL PARISH.</HI></HEAD>
<P>AT <HI>Avon-marsh Siambr,</HI> (see p. 52.) we quit the parish of <HI>Whiteford,</HI> and enter the township of <HI>Greenfield,</HI> in the parish of <HI>Holywell,</HI> along a most excellent road. On the left is a continuation of the marsh. Above which is a low cliff, of the same nature as those which front the shore of the parish of <HI>Whiteford.</HI></P>
<P>LET me preface this little history with saying that <HI>Avon Marsh Siambr</HI> is six miles distant from the rill which divides <HI>Holywell</HI> parish from that of <HI>Flint;</HI> that its greatest breadth is three miles from the turnpike road in <HI>Greenfield,</HI> to the borders of the parish of <HI>Skyviog;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">TOWNSHIPS.</NOTE> and that the parish consists of the town∣ships of <HI>Holywell, Greenfield, Bagillt Vawr</HI> and <HI>Vechan, Whel∣ston, Coleshill Vawr</HI> and <HI>Vechan, Brynfordd,</HI> and <HI>Calcoed.</HI> Its
<PB N="186" REF="200"/>
boundaries on the east are <HI>Flint,</HI> and part of <HI>Northop</HI> parishes; on the east <HI>Halkin;</HI> on the south-east <HI>Skyviog;</HI> on the west <HI>Whiteford;</HI> and on the north the estuary of the river <HI>Dee.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE>ABOVE <HI>Avon-marsh Siambr,</HI> on the rising ground, stands <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cky<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> a small house, which, with the estate belonging to it, has been of late years purchased by <HI>James Potts,</HI> publican in <HI>Holywell,</HI> and the house much improved. It originally belonged to a <HI>Mostyn,</HI> a younger branch of the <HI>Mostyns</HI> of <HI>Trelacre; T. M.</HI> signi∣fying the name of <HI>Thomas Mostyn,</HI> cut above the arms on the mo∣nument. A daughter of this gentleman, or one of his descendants, and heiress of the place, transferred the estate into the very antient family of the <HI>Blounts,</HI> of <HI>Orlton,</HI> in the county of <HI>Hereford,</HI> and with them it remained till the purchase by the present possessor.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">RIVER DEE COMPANY.</NOTE>THE rights of the freeholders over the marsh extend a certain way to the east. These were settled by commissioners, in the year 1787, and a plan made, asserting the clames, as well of the freeholders, as of the <HI>River Dee Company.</HI> These were founded on acts of parlement, originating in the years 1732 and the fol∣lowing, from that of the 11th and 12th of <HI>William</HI> III. entitled,
<Q>An act to enable the mayor and citizens of <HI>Chester</HI> to recover and preserve the navigation of the river <HI>Dee.</HI></Q>
It is possible that Mr. <HI>Andrew Yarrenton</HI> might be the primary cause of the improvements, by a survey he had made, in the year 1674, of the river <HI>Dee</HI> and its estuary.—I refer my reader to the account I have given, at p. 200 of my <HI>Welsh Tour,</HI> vol. i. for farther particulars.</P>
<P>THE other acts were passed in the years 1740, 1742, and 1752, and the works were begun with vigor. The project was carried on by subscription; and the adventurers were to be
<PB N="187" REF="201"/>
rewarded by the lands they were empowered to gain on both sides, from the <HI>White Sands,</HI> or the sea from <HI>Chester;</HI> and between the county of <HI>Cheshire,</HI> on the north side, and the county of <HI>Flint</HI> on the south side; being sands, soil, and ground not bearing grass. The tract, as appears by the chart attending the award made in 1787, and preserved among the records by the clerk of the peace for the county of <HI>Flint,</HI> terminate on our side at the <HI>Point of Air,</HI> in the parish of <HI>Llanasaph:</HI> on the <HI>Cheshire</HI> side at the <HI>Little Meels,</HI> at the extremity of the hundred of <HI>Wiral.</HI></P>
<P>THE adventurers in the River <HI>Dee</HI> Company have gained a considerable quantity of land from the ravages of the sea, be∣ginning from the walls of the city of <HI>Chester,</HI> and extending above five miles, even beyond the lower ferry.</P>
<P>THE report of the quantity of embanked land made from the beginning, by the River <HI>Dee</HI> Company and others (according as it is made to me by Mr. <HI>Wedge,</HI> agent to the company) is as follows:

project was some years ago formed, of making two canals. The one to be carried over the marsh (assisted by the <HI>Holywell</HI> stream) down to or near the perch or anchoring-ground; with a lock ca∣pable of receiving vessels of a hundred tons burden.</P>
<P>ANOTHER canal was designed to have branched from this eastward as far as <HI>Pentre r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k,</HI> near <HI>Flint-castle,</HI> for the purpose of carrying the coal which was or may be discovered on that tract, either to the various mineral works, or into the lock for exportation. I trust, if ever the plan is resumed, that it may ex∣tend a little farther, to the collieries belonging to Sir <HI>Roger Mostyn</HI> and myself, and others which may be discovered here∣after. Nor see we any reason for our exclusion by so impolitic a partiality! The more choice of shops, the cheaper the goods. Both of the plans were taken by the able engineer, Mr. <HI>William Jessop,</HI> in the year 1785, and declared to be practicable. The expence indeed would have been very great; but alas! the aspect of the times forbids us to flatter ourselves with the resumption of the great design.</P>

as far as three miles from the turnpike road. In a late act of parlement for ascertaining the rights of the parish, and those of the company, in the spring of 1791, the agents for the company, after the act to confirm a line of boundary between the property of the company and the part of the marsh which was common, had been twice read, introduced clauses to render their pro∣perty extra-parochial, and consequently to exempt the occu∣piers from contributing to the church and poor, and other parochial rates of <HI>Holywell, Whiteford,</HI> or any parishes concerned; and also to exempt future householders from being liable to execute any offices within those parishes; and at the expence of others, artfully attempting to exonerate their tenants from bearing any part of the burdens. But the design was discovered, and the offensive clause omitted.</P>
<P>THE company have obtained a grant of all their lands from the parish of <HI>Hawarden</HI> to that of <HI>Whiteford,</HI> under the follow∣ing circumstances:

to his constable to pass to his assistance: which sands, from that time, were called the <HI>Constable's Sands. Bradshaw</HI> styles the place of his retreat an abby; a proof that here had been a re∣ligious community before the time usually assigned for the foun∣dation of this house. I must also draw from Lord <HI>Lyttelton</HI>'s au∣thority (for I can find no other) that this castle was demolished by the <HI>Welsh</HI> in the reign of <HI>Stephen</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hist.

<P>HENRY II. in 1157, after his escape from the ambuscade of <HI>Eulo,</HI> left <HI>Basingwerk</HI> restored, well fortified, and manned <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">M.

He did the same by the castle of <HI>Ruddlan.</HI> In his days the inland parts of our county were a dangerous wild of forest. After his defeat he never trusted himself among our woods; but made his marches along the open shores.</P>
<P>THE same monarch left another species of garrison <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Pow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l.</HI> 208.</NOTE>; for he established here a house of knights templars, a military order introduced into <HI>England</HI> in the preceding reign. They were first instituted in the Holy Land for the protection of pilgrims; and possibly <HI>Henry</HI> might have the same in view in fixing them here, to secure the <HI>English</HI> devotees in performing their vows to our neighboring saint, who seems about this time to have come into reputation. It is singular, that these religious knights were allowed at their institution only one horse between two; yet so greatly did they flourish, that about the year 1240, or a hundred and fifty years after their institution, the order had acquired, in different parts of <HI>Christendom,</HI> nineteen thousand manors.</P>
<P>THIS castle was but of very short duration; for in 1165, the gallant prince <HI>Owen Gwynedd</HI> laid siege to it, took <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><HI>Powel.</HI> 223.</NOTE> and levelled

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">ABBY.</NOTE>THE abby <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Called also by the <HI>Welsh, Maes-glas,</HI> or <HI>Greenfield.</HI></NOTE>, of which there are some considerable remains, was founded in 1131 (according to the opinion of Bishop <HI>Tanner</HI>) by <HI>Randal</HI> the second earl of <HI>Chester:</HI> according to Bishop <HI>Fleet∣wood,</HI> by <HI>Henry</HI> II. For my part, I believe it to be of greater antiquity; but do not pretend to derive its origin. No light into the matter can be collected from the charters preserved by Sir <HI>William Dugdale.</HI> There are three of them, either serving to confirm the antient donations, or confer new: in each is mention of the earl as a benefactor; but there is not the lest hint of his having been the founder. I must attribute that honor to one of the princes of <HI>Wales;</HI> for both <HI>Lhewelyn ap Jor∣werth,</HI> and his son <HI>David,</HI> in their respective charters recite, that they give and confirm the several donations to GOD, St. <HI>Mary,</HI> the monastery of <HI>Basingwerk,</HI> and the monks, which had been bestowed on them by their predecessors for the salvation of their souls.</P>
<P>RANDAL was certainly a great benefactor; for it appears, that before his days the monks had only a chapel here. From that period it became considerable; and about that time part of the present buildings were erected, for the conveniency of its inhabi∣tants, who were of the <HI>Cistercian</HI> order.</P>

<P>THE architecture is mixed. Here appears what is called <HI>Saxon;</HI> having the round arches and short columns in some parts; and the Gothic narrow slips of high-pointed win lows in others. The first species had not fallen out of use, and the last was coming into fashion, in the days of the first great benefactor.</P>
<P>THE church lay on the east side; but is now almost destroyed. The refectory is pretty entire; and on one side has a great recess, with two round arches. The pillars which support them are very curious, formed of circular stones of the form of cheeses, set close one upon the other.</P>
<P>ABOVE were the cells for the lodgings of the monks, with a small window to each.</P>
<P>THE chapel of the knights templars is a spacious building. The windows are long, narrow, and pointed; the pilasters be∣tween them on the inside slender and elegant.</P>
<P>WHATEVER monuments or inscriptions might have been in the church, are totally destroyed, unless that which may be found in one of the out-houses. It preserves the memory of a pious emigrant of the last century, <HI>George,</HI> youngest and eighth son of <HI>William</HI> second Lord <HI>Petre,</HI> who, plagued with the fanatical per∣secutions in the reign of <HI>Charles</HI> I. quitted his country, died at

<P>IN 1540, the house and lands in the neighborhood were granted to <HI>Henry ap Harry,</HI> of the tribe of <HI>Ednowain Bendew;</HI> whose only daughter <HI>Anne,</HI> by her marriage with <HI>William Mostyn,</HI> esquire, of <HI>Trelacre,</HI> conveyed it into that family, in which it now remains.</P>
<P>I CANNOT recover the names of any more than two of the abbots. <HI>Thomas ap Dafydd Pennant</HI> presided over the house in the time of <HI>Guttun Owain,</HI> a bard who flourished in the year 1480. Beside that, and another eulogist mentioned in p. 34, I may add a third, <HI>viz. Thomas ap Rhys ap Howel,</HI> of <HI>Stokyn,</HI> who pub∣lished an <HI>awdl</HI> or ode in his praise. It is to be found in the <HI>Se∣bright Collection,</HI> vol. i. p. 37. among a collection of poems and prophecies delivered by the bard when the <HI>awen,</HI> or <HI>furor poeticus,</HI> had full possession of him.</P>
<P>I SHALL not here repeat what I have said of this celebrated abbot, in pp. 33, 34, but refer to them for his history. I shall only add here, that the ruins of a noble oak, still to be seen near the remains of the abby, is supposed to have been his co∣temporary.</P>
<P>I HAVE spoken of his son and successor <HI>Nicholas,</HI> at pp. 24, 34; and shall again, in the article <HI>Bagillt,</HI> resume the subject.</P>
<P>THE whole road from the abby to St. <HI>Wenefrede</HI>'s well, is most remarkably picturesque, along a narrow but deep valley, bounded
<PB N="201" REF="215"/>
on one side by hanging woods. In former times the sacred stream hurried to the sea unconfined by the busy manufactures. During the reign of pilgrimages nothing but the corn-mills, the property of the monks, found employ for its waters.</P>
<P>BEFORE I advance up the valley, let me observe, that notwith∣standing it has the common causes of health, a rapid stream, and the greatest part of the year a brisk wind (usually from west to east) yet it is visited with the usual diseases of the country, in a degree even greater than other parts; nor has the <HI>angina maligna,</HI> hereafter to be spoken of, spared the children of this little tract.</P>
<P>COMMERCE found its way to the valley about fifty years ago.<NOTE PLACE="marg">WHITE AND RED LEAD WORKS.</NOTE> I can remember the building of the works of white and of red lead under the conduct of Messrs. <HI>Smedley.</HI> But prior to these, a little above, was a tilting-mill, and an iron-wire mill.<NOTE PLACE="marg">IRON-WIRE MILL.</NOTE> The first lessees were <HI>Hart</HI> and Co. from <HI>Yorkshire.</HI> They were suc∣ceeded by Mr. <HI>Barker</HI> and Sir <HI>James Creed,</HI> who erected a new one on the lower part of the stream. On Mr. <HI>Barker</HI>'s death the remainder of the term was purchased by Mr. <HI>John Norman</HI> and Mr. <HI>Rouben Chambers.</HI> Under a new leafe Mr. <HI>John Chambers</HI> converted the old mill into a steel-wire-mill; before which his mo∣ther used it for a warehouse for a coarse-paper-mill.<NOTE PLACE="marg">PAPER MILLS.</NOTE> The <HI>Parys</HI> mine company succeeded to both the premises, and covered them with their important edifices.</P>
<P>IT must be observed, that the antient corn-mills, belonging to the abby, stood where the paper-mill was, the <HI>molendina quae juxta portam abbatiae habent</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dugdale Monast.</HI> I. 721.</NOTE>.</P>

It joined the old and uppermost corn-mill. It was taken down by the cotton company, who on the site built part of the new corn-mill, near the <HI>Holywell</HI> spring.</P>
<P>PETER PARRY, tobacconist, had two snuff-mills, one on the land of <HI>John Pierce,</HI> joiner, deceased, a little below the crescent cotton-mill. It was purchased by the brass battering-mill com∣pany, for the sake of giving their pool a little greater depth of water, which built another for <HI>Peter Parry,</HI> below their brass-works.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">OLD SMELTING-WORK.</NOTE>AN antient smelting-work stood in my memory on the site of the old cotton-mill, and part of the garden. They were erected before the year 1733, by lease from <HI>Roger Pennant,</HI> <ABBR>esq</ABBR> of <HI>Bagillt.</HI> I do not recollect the names of the lessees, but the com∣pany was known by that of Madam <HI>Kaye</HI> and Co. The smoke did such injury to the fine woods belonging to Sir <HI>George Mostyn,</HI> of <HI>Trelacre,</HI> bart. as to occasion many law-suits between Sir <HI>George</HI> and the company; so that there ensued a total cessation of the smelting-trade in these works. Whether the suit came to a decision, does not appear. The suit must have commenced before <HI>March</HI> 26th, 1733, from which day all proceedings, which used before to be in <HI>Latin,</HI> were to be carried on in the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> tongue. Just before that period poor Sir <HI>George</HI> suffered a nonsuit, for using the word <HI>propè</HI> instead of <HI>juxta;</HI> and was foiled a second time, by using in the proceeding the title of Sir <HI>George Mostyn,</HI> instead of <HI>George Mostyn,</HI> <ABBR>esq</ABBR> his elder brother being liv∣ing, and at that time an ecclesiastic in the church of <HI>Rome:</HI> and it

is said that he suffered a third repulse, by stating that the works were in the township of <HI>Greenfield,</HI> instead of <HI>Holywell,</HI> or <HI>vice versa.</HI></P>
<P>HOW the affair ended I cannot learn. The building reverted into the hands of the heirs of the lessors. <HI>Edward Pennant,</HI> <ABBR>esq</ABBR> granted a lease of it, in 1758, to Mr. <HI>Champion,</HI> partner and agent in the <HI>Wormley</HI> company, near <HI>Bristol,</HI> who there calcined <HI>black-jack.</HI> He was the first who engaged in such a concern in this country, and probably in <HI>Great Britain,</HI> which he carried on under the protection of a patent.</P>
<P>A PIN-MILL was built in 1764, for the use of <HI>James Eden,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">PIN-MILL.</NOTE> pin-maker, who occupied it about two years, and then failed. The next occupier was Mrs. <HI>Chambers,</HI> who converted it into a coarse-paper mill, and continued the use of it till 1783, when it fell into the hands of the cotton-company, which turned it into a smithy: and, finally, three corn-mills,<NOTE PLACE="marg">THREE CORN-MILLS.</NOTE> formed with the above the sum of the works upon the stream, in my early days. The lower of these two, reckoning from the well, was pulled down.</P>
<P>IN the year 1766 began the memorable epoch in the annals of our famous stream, when the late Mr. <HI>Patten</HI> of <HI>Warrington,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">FAMOUS EPOCH OF COMMERCE.</NOTE> and Co. built the first battering-mill for copper and brass. In about ten years from that time, Mr. <HI>John Smalley,</HI> now deceased, introduced the first manufacture of cotton. By his successors, and by the great copper-companies, those <HI>behemoths</HI> of commerce, our little <HI>Jordan</HI> was soon drunk up.

These great works are under the firm of the PARYS MINE COMPANY.<NOTE PLACE="marg">PARYS MINE COMPANY.</NOTE> The buildings were completed in the year 1780, and held under lease from Sir <HI>Pyers Mostyn,</HI> bart. owner of the whole stream, excepting a small part. To Mr. <HI>Samuel Williamson,</HI> chief agent of this part of the works, I am indebted for the account of the works carried on here. These are entirely confined to the manufacture of copper.</P>
<P>IN this department is a great forge for heating the cakes of copper, previously to their being beat into pans, or rolled into sheathings, &amp;c. &amp;c. The wheels and machinery are set in motion by the water from a large pool, parallel to the road, which is filled from the stream, and let out by another channel to effect its purposes.</P>
<P>THESE may be called the great magazines for the supply of the royal navy with the various necessaries in copper, such as sheath∣ings, bolts, and nails. Some of the bolts are twenty feet long, and so hardened by rolling and battering, as to be capable of being driven almost to their heads, in the entrance forward, and run abaft of the ships where the beds of timber are the thickest; which work is facilitated by boring with an anger two-thirds of the length.</P>
<P>SOME of the nails are a foot in length, and from that size to that of a sadler's cack.</P>
<P>RUDDER bands and braces are here made of an enormous
<PB N="205" REF="219"/>
size; some, designed for the largest first-rates, weighed one ton fourteen hundred.</P>
<P>THE number of men employed in these works is ninety-three. This is intended when they are in full employ: the same must be understood of all the rest.</P>
<P>THE head of water to this mill is about twenty-one feet and a half, and the superficial surface of the pool about 112,028 feet.</P>
<P>THE trade of these works is not confined to the royal navy. The merchant ships are from hence supplied with considerable quantities of sheathing, bolts, and nails, as are many of the ships in the service of the <HI>East India</HI> Company.</P>
<P>FROM hence braziers are furnished with copper vessels of all kinds, and the materials for all the copper branches of their business.</P>
<P>THE works on this river are supplied with their copper from the <HI>Parys</HI> mine and <HI>Mona</HI> mine companies; the ore of which is smelted chiefly at <HI>Ravenhead,</HI> and <HI>Stanley,</HI> in <HI>Lancashire.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Cornish</HI> ores are smelted at <HI>Swansey, Neath, Bristol,</HI> and in <HI>Cornwal.</HI></P>
<P>THE Duke of <HI>Devonshire</HI>'s ores, at <HI>Whiston,</HI> in <HI>Derbyshire.</HI></P>
<P>THE number of vessels immediately employed by the copper-companies on this river, to convey the several manufactures, or the materials to and from <HI>Leverpool,</HI> and the other places con∣nected with them, amount to between thirty and forty, from thirty to fifty tons burden.</P>
<P>MR. WILLIAMS has, besides the works on the <HI>Holywell</HI> stream, two near <HI>Marlow,</HI> in <HI>Buckinghamshire,</HI> upon as large a scale as those in <HI>Greenfield.</HI> There are also in this kingdom others be∣longing

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">THE COMPANY'S COIN.</NOTE>I MUST not be silent on the subject of the most beautiful coin or token in use by this great company, as it exceeds in elegance any which has been yet emitted. On one side is the head of a <HI>Druid,</HI> emblematic of the isle of <HI>Mona,</HI> the antient seat of the ve∣nerable order, and which now produces the material of the coin.

<P>VAST quantities of these coins are counterfeited at <HI>Birmingham,</HI> and may be had by public order in any number.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">BRASS MELTING-HOUSES.</NOTE>ABOVE these works is a great cluster of vast square chimnies, the discharge of the tremendous volumes of thick black smoke, rising from the making of brass. These are the brass melting-houses belonging to the <HI>Greenfield</HI> copper and brass company, under the direction of Mr. <HI>Donbavand,</HI> where they have six large melting houses with twenty-four fires, each fire contains nine pots, with metal, fluxes, &amp;c. Here they make plate-brass for the purpose of being manufactured at their battery-mills, plate-brass for wire for the pin-manufacturers, and ingot-brass for the va∣rious founders, &amp;c. At this place they have a mill, places to calcine, buddle, and grind the <HI>lapis calaminaris,</HI> &amp;c. for the pur∣pose of making brass; also a copper forge, not used at present: the head of water is about 21½ feet, superficial surface of the pool about 23,664 feet. The number of the men employed in these works, is about fifty. The materials for the making of
<PB N="207" REF="221"/>
brass are all at hand. The copper shot and clippings are from the adjacent works, the calamine from our own mines, and the charcoal from our woods. The art of making brass in early times, is mentioned before at pp. 123, 124. The first patent for the calamine stone, and the use thereof, was granted to <HI>William Humsrey,</HI> and <HI>Christopher Shutz,</HI> dated the 17th of <HI>September,</HI> 1565, at which time the long lost art in these kingdoms began to revive.</P>
<P>IN digging the foundation for the brass melting-houses,<NOTE PLACE="marg">HYPOCAUST.</NOTE> Mr. <HI>Donbavand</HI> discovered an antient <HI>Roman</HI> hypocaust, furnished with various flues, with the superincumbent tiles of a fine red color. These artificial hot baths and sweating-rooms were the greatest luxuries of the <HI>Romans.</HI> This proves that they had a stationary settlement in this place, probably of merchants concerned in the mineral works, which they certainly had on the adjacent moun∣tains, of which I have given an account in p. 122 of this book.</P>
<P>NOT far from this work, on the east-side of the river,<NOTE PLACE="marg">WIRE-WORK.</NOTE> is the great manufactory of brass wire of every denomination. Also here are drawn the square materials for making copper nails, which are formed by the common process of beating and heading. This work has a head of twenty-three feet, which is capable, by means of an extensive pool, that may be formed above, of having a very large work built on the now vacant spot.</P>
<P>AT a small distance to the south,<NOTE PLACE="marg">COTTON-WORK.</NOTE> a most magnificent cotton-work soars, like the tower of <HI>Babel,</HI> above all the lower buildings. I shall here only say, that about ten weeks before its completion, nothing but a void appeared before me: at the expiration of that space, in another ride I took, I cannot express my astonishment at seeing the enormous mass risen, as if by magic, out of the
<PB N="208" REF="222"/>
ground. It was erected in the summer of 1785: is thirty-six yards long, ten yards wide, and six stories high, and is worked with a water-wheel eighteen feet high, and seven feet wide, with a fall of water of sixteen feet.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">NE<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> POLLING MILL.</NOTE>AT some distance beyond this is the NEW ROLLING MILL, erected in 1787 <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is superintended by Mr. <HI>Joseph Thomas,</HI> to whom I am indebted for the account.</NOTE>. The largest and most commodious build∣ing, for the purpose it is applied to, of any in the kingdom. Its area within the walls measures eighty-six feet in length, by sixty-nine in breadth, floored with iron flags. Its height in the center is twenty-eight feet and an half. The roof is single, and covered with copper, supported in the center by two pillars, eleven feet and a half distant from each other; on their tops are transverse timbers supporting one end of each beam which more immediately sustains the roof, the other end resting on the wall.</P>
<P>THE water-wheels are of cast-iron, upon a curious construction. They are three in number, each of which receives its supply of water, at a height of about forty-five degrees, from an iron-pipe fixed in the bottom of the penstock, and so fitted to the buckets of the wheel, that scarce any water is wasted (of which we are studiously careful.) Wheels so receiving their water are called <HI>breast-wheels,</HI> of which kind I believe all the wheels on this stream are, excepting that belonging to the corn-mill, and another at this company's brass-works, which is used for grinding calamine; the water by that mode of delivery communicating the most powerful impulse, and the most steady motion. The iron-wheels here are twenty feet diameter, and they will, when unclogged with
<PB N="209" REF="223"/>
heavy weights, perform twenty revolutions in a minute. Now if we suppose a wheel of that diameter moving upon a plane with the same rapidity with which it revolves on its axis, it will, in a year, describe a line nearly equal in length to five circles of our globe at the equator. The yard and reservoir of water pertain∣ing to this noble manufactory are suitable to its magnitude, and by much the most spacious on the <HI>Holywell</HI> stream.</P>
<P>THE number of men employed here are about forty-six.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="remarks">
<HEAD>REMARKS.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1st. IT is a certain fact that the people constantly employed in the copper-manufactories are as healthy, and arrive to as great an age, as the generality of people employed in other occupations not connected with fire or metal; but they are scrupulous ob∣servers of the antient law, which forbade to eat with unwashen hands; and they find it highly necessary to perform a careful ab∣lution of the whole body at lest once a week, to rub off the cop∣per dust, which adheres to their bodies, and occasions violent eruptions of a green color, evincing, by the tinge, their origin. The pain and symptoms are easily removed by washing with clean water; but if that is neglected, the consequences become se∣rious, and even to require chirurgical assistance.</P>
<P N="2">2d. YOUNG dogs, which have acquired a habit of licking cop∣per sheets or bars, have never been known to survive long. The metallic virus by that means conveyed into the intestines soon destroys the animal by violent purging.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="210" REF="224"/>3d, YET it may deserve notice, that the writer of these hints having formerly kept a great number of poultry running about the yard, he observed that the fowls preferred drinking the water from a shallow copper pan that lay out of doors, and was generally full of rain-water, tinged of a deep green color, to fresh clear water, of which there was abundance. No ill effect was ever known to have happened to them from the green water, though a succession of poultry resorted to it for years.</P>
<P>THE writer of this having been employed on the spot, from the first opening of the ground for the foundations of the mill and other buildings, found frequent proofs that the surface of the land had formerly been about fourteen or sixteen feet lower than at the time the buildings were erected. His inducements to form that opinion were,</P>
<P N="1">1st. THAT though the soil contained many large pebbles throughout its whole depth, yet at the depth of twelve to sixteeen or eighteen feet, grey pebbles of large size were every where found in great abundance, and mixed with sand or gravel, just as they appear on the shelving shores of many rivers.</P>
<P N="2">2d. AT the depth of fifteen feet, under the wood where the warehouse now stands, the head of a battle-axe was picked up. The writer not chancing to be on the spot when it was taken up, could gather no information whether any part of the handle re∣mained, but supposes not. He was shewn the spot where it lay, and measured fifteen feet to the surface.</P>
<P N="3">3d. AND the most decisive proof is, that, after cutting down an oak-tree of pretty large girth, and afterwards clearing away the root, in digging still deeper, for the foundation of the present
<PB N="211" REF="225"/>
warehouse, the workmen found a lime-kiln, of very small dimen∣sion, perhaps it would contain half a ton of lime-stone, but perfect, and having calcined lime in its bason. It was constructed of the same kind of red sand-stone as that now below <HI>Wepre.</HI> The bottom of that kiln now forms the lowest foundation of the north-east corner of the warehouse, which is nea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly level with the surface of the cotton-mill-pool below it.</P>
<P>IMMEDIATELY above the last are the works under the super-intendency of Mr. <HI>Daniel Donbavand,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">GREENFIELD COPPER AND BRASS COMPANY.</NOTE> who with great civility informed me of their origin, and consequent improvements. These are on the site of the brass-battery-mills, built in the year 1765, and set to work 20th <HI>Sept.</HI> 1766. The first brass made at <HI>Greenfield,</HI> was on the 20th <HI>August,</HI> 1766, then held by Mess. <HI>Patten</HI> and Co. Since <HI>January</HI> 1786 they have been in the hands of <HI>Thomas Williams,</HI> <ABBR>esq</ABBR> and Co. under the firm of <HI>The Greenfield Copper and Brass Company,</HI> who have very much improved them by various erections, so as to enable them to finish goods for <HI>Africa, America,</HI> and most other markets, <HI>viz.</HI> brass <HI>Neptunes,</HI> or large pans, in which the negroes make salt; pans for getting the gold out of their rivers, and for various other purposes; kettles; brass and copper rods; bright and black <HI>manillas</HI>—the first are rings for ornaments to the arms and legs, the last for the current money of the country. The last are not unlike the golden bracelets of the antient <HI>Britons,</HI> the ends turned up and flatted; and add to these various sorts of <HI>latten,</HI> brass, &amp;c. for mathema∣tical instruments, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>THE word <HI>latten</HI> is applied to works in brass, with which, for certain purposes, is an admixture of any other metal. Some∣times
<PB N="212" REF="226"/>
it is made a synonym of brass itself. <HI>Watson's Essays,</HI> IV. 70. and in the same page: and <HI>Stringer,</HI> in his <HI>Opera Mineralia Ex∣plicate,</HI> p. 34. gives us the qualities of the said <HI>latten,</HI> as explain∣ed in the patent of 7th <HI>Elizabeth</HI> to <HI>Humphrey</HI> and <HI>Shutz,</HI> above∣mentioned, which was granted to <HI>Shutz</HI> for
<Q>his great cunning, knowlege and experience, as well in the finding the calamine stone, called in <HI>Latin, lapis calaminaris,</HI> and in the right and proper commodity thereof, for the composition of mixed me∣tal, commonly called <HI>latten,</HI> and in reducing it to be soft and malleable, and also in apting, manuring, and working the same for and into all sorts of battery wares, cast-work, and wire, and also in the mollifying and manuring of iron, and drawing and forging of the same into wire and plates for the mak∣ing of armor, and also for divers other needful and profitable uses.</Q></P>
<P>THE word <HI>latten</HI> is also used for a distinct metal, as appears by two patents, one of the 30th <HI>Henry</HI> VI. to his chaplain and con∣troller of all his mines of gold, &amp;c. in <HI>Devon</HI> and <HI>Cornwal,</HI> (see <HI>Stringer,</HI> p. 20.); the other in the patent of 10th <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> (see <HI>Watson,</HI> iv. 70.) both which mention mines of <HI>latten.</HI> But, as the Bishop observes, whatever the name did mean, it is now lost. I can only say, that calamine does appear in so many, and so dif∣ferent forms, that the application might have been to one of them, since the qualities seem to have been the same.</P>
<P>THE head of water to these mills is about 21½ feet; and the superficial surface of the pool or reservoir, about 70,696 feet.</P>

<P>COTTON wool is produced in the <HI>East</HI> and <HI>West Indies,</HI> and also in many other places. The Isle of <HI>Bowbon,</HI> in the <HI>East Indies,</HI> fur∣nishes the best; the next to this in quality, grows in the <HI>Portuguese</HI> settlements in <HI>South America,</HI> from whence it is exported to <HI>Lisbon,</HI> and imported from thence to <HI>England</HI> in <HI>British</HI> bottoms, duty-free. If in foreign bottoms, a penny <HI>per</HI> pound is paid. About fifteen years ago, not more than five hundred bags were culti∣vated in the <HI>Brazils;</HI> but of late years, on an average, fifty thou∣sand. The <HI>Dutch</HI> settlements, say <HI>Berbice</HI> and <HI>Surinam,</HI> supply a considerable quantity of good cotton, and comes to this country better cleaned than any other.</P>
<P>THE cotton-plant grows naturally in <HI>China</HI> and <HI>India.</HI> The cultivation travelled westward into <HI>Arabia, Persia,</HI> and the <HI>Levant.</HI> It is also cultivated in the province of <HI>Valencia,</HI> in <HI>Spain,</HI> with vast success. On the plains of that rich province, in good years, about four hundred and fifty thousand <HI>arrobas</HI> (of 26 lb. each) are har∣vested. I suppose all this to be manufactured in <HI>Spain,</HI> at lest I do not hear of any being imported into our kingdoms.</P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="233"/>COTTON twist is spun here of 130 hanks to the pound. Each hank is 840 yards long, so that one pound of cotton thread thus fine will be 62 miles 80 yards long. The new principle (for it is not yet 30 years old) by which cotton wool is made so perfect a thread, is by the use of iron-rollers moving horizontally; their speed is governed by brass wheels of different sizes and numbers, calculated to produce what fineness is wanted; the twist required is given by the flier and spindle. The cotton-twist made here is sent chiefly into <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland,</HI> to be woven into ginghams, muslins, muslinets, dimities, nankeens, fine callicoes, fustians, &amp;c. &amp;c. which goods, when finished, are either admitted or smuggled into every part of the known world. It is introduced into every part of the <HI>Russian</HI> dominions, and even into the distant <HI>Kamt∣schatka.</HI></P>
<P>A NUMBER of machines called <HI>Mules</HI> are also used here with success:<NOTE PLACE="marg">MULES.</NOTE> this machine is a compound of the water-engine and the spinning-jenny, and being of a mixed breed, was, I presume, the reason of its being so named. It is a machine particularly adapted to the spinning of fine yarns, and far exceeds every other yet dis∣covered for that purpose.</P>
<P>THE last mill on the river is a corn-mill:<NOTE PLACE="marg">CORN-MILL.</NOTE> a large building erected by the cotton-twist company, instead of the old one; and of another which stood a little lower down, on the site of which stands part of the great cotton-mill.</P>
<P>THE length of the stream, from the fountain to the marsh,<NOTE PLACE="marg">LENGTH OF THE STREAM.</NOTE> is one mile and two hundred and thirty-four yards. The following are the number of falls, from the level of the marsh to the spring-head:

<P>LET me conclude with remarking the vast population these companies have brought to the townships of <HI>Holywell</HI> and <HI>Green∣field.</HI> In respect to the first, there is no great increase of building; but the latter has of late years received such an addition in works and in houses, that almost the whole is a continued series of edifices of different kinds, from the upper corn-mill quite to the sea-side. Among them are a hundred and seventy-seven houses for workmen of different occupations, of which few in∣deed have been erected beyond my memory.</P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="235"/>THE origin of this useful stream is discovered at the foot of the steep hill, beneath the town of <HI>Holywell,</HI> or <HI>Treffynnon,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">ST. WENEFREDE'S WELL.</NOTE> to which it gave the name. The spring boils with vast impetuosity out of a rock, and is confined in a beautiful polygonal well, co∣vered with a rich arch, supported by pillars <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>John Ingleby</HI> has engraven a print of this elegant building, from a drawing by himself, which is sold by Mr. <HI>Cairus,</HI> bookseller, <HI>Holywell.</HI></NOTE>. The roof is most exquisitely carved in stone. Immediately over the fountain is the legend of St. <HI>Wenefrede,</HI> on a pendent projection, with the arms of <HI>England</HI> at the bottom. Numbers of fine ribs secure the arch, whose intersections are coupled with a sculpture.</P>
<P>SOME are mere works of fancy; grotesque figures of animals: but the rest allude chiefly to the <HI>Stanley</HI> family. This building, and the chapel over it, rose from the piety of that great house, which left these memorials of its benefactions: there are besides some marks of the illustrious donors; for example, the profile of <HI>Margaret,</HI> mother to <HI>Henry</HI> VII. and that of her husband the earl of <HI>Derby,</HI> cut on the same stone.</P>
<P>THE compliments to the <HI>Stanleys,</HI> are very frequent. The <HI>wolf</HI>'s head is the arms of the earls of <HI>Chester:</HI> it is inclosed in a garter, in respect to Sir <HI>William Stanley,</HI> knight of that order, who had been chamberlain of that city, and justiciary of <HI>North Wales.</HI> The tun with a plant issuing out of it, is a <HI>rebus,</HI> the arms of his wife <HI>Elizabeth Hopton,</HI> allusive to her name. This proves, that the building was erected before 1495, in which year Sir <HI>William</HI> lost his head. The other badges of the same house are, the stag's head; the eagle's leg; and the three legs, the arms of the isle of <HI>Man.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="220" REF="236"/>WE also find, that <HI>Catherine</HI> of <HI>Arragon,</HI> widow to prince <HI>Arthur,</HI> and afterwards the unfortunate wife of his brother <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. was a benefactress to this building; at left her arms appear here: three pomegranates in a shield, surmounted with a crown; the badge of the house of <HI>Granada,</HI> in memory of the expulsion of the <HI>Moors,</HI> by her father <HI>Ferdinand</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sandford's Gencal. <HI>475.</HI></NOTE>. The eagle seems also to belong to her, being one of the supporters of the arms of her family.</P>
<P>OVER one of the lesser arches, on each side of the well, are the dragon and gre-hound, the supporters of the arms of <HI>England</HI> during the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> VII. and part of that of <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. The first was born by <HI>Henry</HI> VII. as a badge of the house of <HI>Tudor,</HI> which derived itself from <HI>Cadwalader,</HI> last king of <HI>Britain,</HI> who bore on his ensign a red dragon. <HI>Henry,</HI> in imitation of him, at the battle of <HI>Bosworth</HI> carried on his standard a red dragon, paint∣ed on white and green silk; which afterwards gave rise to the office of <HI>Rouge-dragon</HI> among the heralds.</P>
<P>ON one side of a wall that supports the roof, was painted the tale of the tutelar saint; at present almost defaced: over it is in∣scribed, <HI>in honorem Sanctae Wenefredae,</HI> V. &amp; M.</P>
<P>IN another wall is an elegant nich, in which stood a statue of the Virgin <HI>Mary;</HI> pulled down, as I have been informed, in the year 1635.</P>
<P>I HAVE also heard, that there had been another of St. <HI>Wene∣frede.</HI> To grace the image on high festivals, it is probable, that <HI>Isabel,</HI> countess of <HI>Warwick,</HI> widow to the great <HI>Richard
<PB N="221" REF="237"/>
Beauchamp,</HI> left to St. <HI>Wenefrede,</HI> in 1439, her gown of russet velvet <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dugdale's Warwickshire,</HI> I. 414.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>OVER this spring is a chapel,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAPEL.</NOTE> of the same date with the other building: a neat piece of gothic architecture; but in a very ruinous state. The east end is a pentagon, and had five windows with elegant tracery. The top arched, and crossed with neat slender ribs. It had been open to the body of the chapel; but the fine arch which formed the division, has been bricked up a great number of years ago. On one side of the body is an oblong recess, divided from it by three arches, supported by pillars; and within is a window impending over the well. Under the centre window must have stood the altar. The whole length of the chapel is fifty-two feet: the breadth is twenty. The re∣cess is twenty-six feet long, and eight broad. The roof is neat wood-work. This had been a free chapel, in the gift of the bishop, with the reserve of a stipend to the chapter; but the rest of the offerings were to be expended on the chapel. In <HI>Richard</HI> III.'s time, the abbot and convent had from the crown ten marks <HI>yerely, for the sustentacione and salarie of a prieste, at the chapelle of St. Wynefride</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Harl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n MSS.</HI> N<SUP>o</SUP> 433.338.</NOTE>.

<P>THE following order, for putting the chapel over the well into possession of a clergyman of the church of <HI>Rome,</HI>

was addressed to Sir <HI>Roger Mostyn,</HI> baronet, by the queen of <HI>James</HI> II.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">FREE SCHOOL.</NOTE>IN this chapel is kept the free-school for sixteen boys, with a settled salary, from money laid out at interest, of 10<HI>l. per annum.</HI> The vicar appoints the master, which, as far as I recollect, has been a clergyman, excepting in one instance.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">SUNDAY SCHOOLS.</NOTE>BESIDES the <HI>Sunday</HI> school, where the cotton-company's ap∣prentices are instructed, there is another parochial one kept in the chapel over the well. This is supported by a general sub∣scription through the parish; and about seventy poor children are instructed by proper masters, in reading, writing and arithmetick. The copper and brass companies are handsome subscribers, but
<PB N="223" REF="239"/>
they send only a few adults, to be instructed in matters, their more advanced years make them capable of learning.</P>
<P>THIS room has been used as the hall for holding both the great and the quarter sessions. I remember <HI>Matthew Skinner,</HI> esquire, chief justice of <HI>Chester,</HI> holding the assizes there; and I also recollect a quarter sessions: the hall having been properly fitted up for the purpose. But the distance from the center of the county was found so inconvenient, that after these instances they were removed to <HI>Flint,</HI> and finally to <HI>Mold,</HI> where they still continue.</P>
<P>THE window in this chapel impends a vast height over the bathing well.<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAPEL WINDOW.</NOTE> Several persons (not in their sober senses) have leaped into the water, without receiving any other damage than the smart caused by the dashing on the surface from their exalted station. Within my memory, one <HI>John Blackwall,</HI> of <HI>Llanasaph,</HI> took a far more desperate leap into the same water, from the church-yard wall, almost adjoining to the chapel. The leap would have been great, had it been on level ground. Here, had he not reached the water, the consequence would have been, that of being dashed to pieces on the flags.</P>
<P>THE bathing-well is an oblong, 38 feet by 16, with steps for the descent of the fair-sex, or of invalids. Near the steps, two feet beneath the water, is a large stone, called the <HI>wishing-stone.</HI> It receives many a kiss from the faithful, who are supposed never to fail in experiencing the completion of their desires, provided the wish is delivered with full devotion and confidence.</P>
<P>ON the outside of the great well, close to the road,<NOTE PLACE="marg">LITTLE SPRING.</NOTE> is a small spring, once famed for the cure of weak eyes. The patient made an offering to the nymph of the spring, of a crooked pin, and
<PB N="224" REF="240"/>
sent up at the same time a certain ejaculation, by way of charm: but the charm is forgotten, and the efficacy of the waters lost.</P>
<P>THE well is common; for I find by a decision of the court of chancery, on a law-suit respecting the lordship of <HI>Holywell,</HI> be∣tween Sir <HI>John Egerton,</HI> knight, and <HI>John Eldred;</HI> chancellor <HI>Ellesmere</HI> decrees,
<Q>That on calling to mind, that within the said manor there is a fountain or well of antient and worthy memory, he doth not think fit that the petitioner, or any other, should have the property thereof, notwithstanding the general words of the grant of the manor: and therefore his lordship doth order, that notwithstanding the said grant, that the well shall-continue as now it is, or heretofore hath been; saving to the petitioner, and his heirs and assigns, the benefit of the stream and watercourse, with the appertainances.</Q></P>
<P>THERE are two different opinions about the origin of this stream. One party makes it miraculous: the other asserts it to be owing only to natural causes. The advocates for the first, deliver their tale thus:</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">OF SAINT WENE∣FREDE.</NOTE>IN the seventh century lived a virgin of the name of <HI>Wenefrede,</HI> of noble parents; her father's name was <HI>Thewith,</HI> a potent lord in the parts where <HI>Holywell</HI> now stands; her mother's <HI>Wenlo,</HI> de∣scended from an antient family in <HI>Montgomeryshire,</HI> and sister to St. <HI>Beuno. Beuno</HI> assumed the monastic habit, retired to <HI>Clynnog,</HI> in <HI>Caernarvonshire,</HI> where he built a church and founded a con∣vent. After completing this work of piety, he visited his rela∣tions in <HI>Flintshire;</HI> and obtaining from his brother-in-law a little spot at the foot of the hill on which he resided, erected on it a church, and took under his care his niece <HI>Wenefrede.</HI> It is pro∣bable
<PB N="225" REF="241"/>
that the saint used occasionally to make some residence in this country; for near the entrance of the dingle, opposite to the great cotton-work, are two small fields, called to this day <HI>Gerddi Saint Beuno,</HI> or the gardens of St. <HI>Beuno.</HI></P>
<P>A NEIGHBORING prince of the name of <HI>Cradocus,</HI> son of king <HI>Alen,</HI> was struck with her beauty, and at all events determined to gratify his desires. He made known his passion to the lady; who, affected with horror, attempted to escape. The wretch, enraged at the disappointment, instantly pursued her, drew out his sabre, and cut off her head. <HI>Cradocus</HI> instantly received the reward of his crime: he fell down dead, and the earth opening, swallowed his impious corps. <HI>Higden,</HI> in his <HI>Polychronicon,</HI> adds, that even the descendants of this monster were visited with hor∣rible judgments, to be expiated only by a visit to this well, or to the bones of the saint at <HI>Salop.</HI></P>

<P>THE severed head took its way down the hill, and stopt near the church. The valley, which, from its uncommon dryness,

was heretofore called <HI>Sych<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nant,</HI> now lost its name. A spring of uncommon size burst from the place where the head rested.

<P>ST. BEUNO took up the head, carried it to the corps, and, offering up his devotions, joined it nicely to the body, which instantly reunited. The place was visible only by a slender white line encircling her neck, in memory of a miracle, which surpassed far that worked by St. <HI>Dionysius,</HI> who marched in triumph after decapitation, with his head in his hands, from <HI>Mont martre</HI> to St. <HI>Dennis</HI>'s <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Histoire de l'abbaye de St. <HI>Denys,</HI> 76.</NOTE>; or that of St. <HI>Adelbertus,</HI> who, in like circumstances, swam across the <HI>Vistula.</HI></P>
<P>To conclude: St. <HI>Wenefrede</HI> survived her decollation fifteen years. She died at <HI>Gwytherin</HI> in <HI>Denbighshire,</HI> where her bones
<PB N="227" REF="243"/>
rested till the reign of king <HI>Stephen,</HI> when, after divine admo∣nition, they were surrendered to the abby of St. <HI>Peter</HI> and St. <HI>Paul</HI> at <HI>Shrewsbury.</HI> The memory of the two great events, that of her first death is celebrated on the 22d of <HI>June:</HI> that of her translation the 3d of <HI>November.</HI></P>
<P>THE first <HI>Sunday</HI> after St. <HI>James</HI>'s day is also kept in honor of certain saints;<NOTE PLACE="marg">DYDD SUL Y SAINT.</NOTE> (probably St. <HI>Wenefrede</HI> and St. <HI>Beuno</HI>) not with prayers or with holy masses, but in every species of frolick and excess. It originated in the <HI>Romish</HI> church: but I clear that congregation from being concerned in any part of the orgies; which are, I fear, celebrated by persons of our own religion only, who flock here on that day for most unsaintly ends. The day is called <HI>Dydd sul y Saint,</HI> or the <HI>Sunday of the Saints.</HI> I wish I could trace the primaeval ceremonies, and whether one might not have been the <HI>Druidical</HI> custom, the <HI>Deiseal,</HI> or <HI>Deisol,</HI> or turning from the east to the west, according to the course of the sun. In some of the western isles the custom is still preserved with great devotion. <HI>Deas</HI> signifies the right hand, and <HI>sul</HI> the sun, from the ceremony being performed with the right hand always next to the circle, cairn, or whatsoever they surround <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See more in the learned <HI>Porlase's Antiquities of Cornwall,</HI> 124 to 126.</NOTE>. It is possible that this custom might have been applied to our saint, and the words <HI>Deiseil,</HI> or <HI>Deisol,</HI> corrupted for that purpose for <HI>Dydd-sol,</HI> for giving particular sanction to the <HI>Sunday</HI> in question.</P>
<P>A FRATERNITY and gild was established in honor of our saint at <HI>Shrewsbury.</HI> It had its common seal, which,<NOTE PLACE="marg">AN ANTIENT SEAL.</NOTE> through the
<PB N="228" REF="244"/>
kindness of my friend, Mr. <HI>Henry Levingston,</HI> is now in my pos∣session. It is of copper, of the form expressed in plate VI. of Vol. I. of my <HI>Tour in Wales.</HI> In the center is a representation of the martyrdom; above is a cross in form of a T, placed be∣tween the letters <HI>T. m.</HI> which mark the time when the fraternity was instituted, during the abbacy of <HI>Thomas Mynde;</HI> who was elected in 1459, and died in 1499, a period in which these reli∣gious societies were much in fashion. The T or cross refers to the church of St. <HI>Cross</HI> within this monastery. Beneath are probably the arms of the house, a sword and a key, symbols of its tutelar apostles; and round the margin is this inscription:
<Q><L>Sigillū cōe Ffraternitat beate Wenefride virginis</L>
<L>ī <ABBR>eccia</ABBR> sc̄e cruc ī: fra monaster. sc̄i Petri Salopie.</L></Q>
A bell belonging to the church was also christened in honor of her. I cannot learn the names of the gossips, who, as usual, were doubtlessly rich persons. On the ceremony, they all laid hold of the rope; bestowed a name on the bell; and the priest sprinkling it with holy water, baptized it in the name of the Father, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Stovely</HI>'s Hist. Churches, 130.</NOTE>. He then clothed it with a fine garment: after this the gossips gave a grand feast, and made great pre∣sents, which the priest received in behalf of the bell. Thus blessed, it was endowed with great powers; allayed (on being rung) all storms; diverted the thunder-bolt; drove away evil spi∣rits.
<PB N="229" REF="245"/>
These consecrated bells were always inscribed. The in∣scription on that in question ran thus:
<Q><L>Sancta <HI>Wenefreda,</HI> Deo hoc commendare memento,</L>
<L>Ut pietate sua, nos servet ab hoste cruento.</L></Q>
And a little lower was another address:
<Q>Protege l'rece pia, quos convoco, virgo <HI>Marta.</HI></Q></P>
<P>AFTER her death, her sanctity, says her historian, was proved by numberless miracles. The waters were almost as sanative as those of the pool of <HI>Bethesda:</HI> all infirmities incident to the human body met with relief; the votive crutches, the barrows, and other proofs of cures, to this moment remain as evidences pendent over the well. The saint is equally propitious to Pro∣testants and Catholics; for among the offerings are to be found these grateful testimonies from the patients of each religion.</P>
<P>THE Holy Father gave all encouragement to the piety of pil∣grims to frequent this fountain. Pope <HI>Martin</HI> V. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Selden</HI>'s notes on <HI>Michael Drayton,</HI> 289.</NOTE> in the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> V. furnished the abby of <HI>Basingwerk</HI> with pardons and indulgences, to sell to the devotees. These were renewed again in the reign of queen <HI>Mary,</HI> by the interest of <HI>Thomas Goldwell</HI> bishop of St. <HI>Asaph</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Powel</HI>'s notes on <HI>Gi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ald. Cambr.</HI> 874. Mr. <HI>Addison</HI> says he saw his picture at <HI>Ravenna,</HI> in the convent of <HI>Theatins,</HI> among the eminent men of that order.</NOTE>, who fled into <HI>Italy</HI> on the accession of <HI>Eliza∣beth.</HI> Multitudes of offerings flowed in; marks of gratitude from such who had received benefit by intercession of the virgin.</P>
<P><PB N="230" REF="246"/>THE resort of pilgrims of late years to these <HI>Fontanalia</HI> has considerably decreased; the greatest number are from <HI>Lancashire.</HI> In the summer, still a few are to be seen in the water in deep devotion up to their chins for hours, sending up their prayers, or performing a number of evolutions round the polygonal well; or threading the arch between well and well a prescribed number of times. I am sorry to say that this excess of piety has cost several devotees their lives. Few people of rank at present honor the fountain with their presence. A crowned head in the last age dignified the place with a visit. The prince who lost three kingdoms for a mass, payed his respects, on <HI>August</HI> 29th 1686, to our saint; and received as a reward a present of the very shift in which his great-grand-mother <HI>Mary Stuart</HI> lost her head <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The late Doctor <HI>Cooper</HI> of <HI>Chester</HI>'s MSS.</NOTE>. This prince gave, in the course of his progress, as marks of his favor, golden rings, with his hair platted beneath a crystal. I have seen one, which he had bestowed on a <HI>Roman Catholic</HI> priest of a nighboring family. The majority of devotees are of the fair sex, attracted hither to commemorate the martyrdom of St. <HI>Wenefrede,</HI> as those of the East did the death of the <HI>Cyprian</HI> favorite,
<Q><L>Whose annual wound in <HI>Lebanon</HI> allur'd</L>

<P><PB N="231" REF="247"/>WE, whose ancestors, between two and three centuries ago, abridged our faith to the mere contents of the Old and New Testament, and to the creed called the <HI>Apostles,</HI> do not think the belief in the above, and other legends, requisite. I refer the reader to the arguments used by the antiquary Doctor <HI>Powel,</HI> in his notes on the Itinerary of <HI>Giraldus Cambrensis,</HI> and to Bishop <HI>Fleetwood</HI>'s annotations on the life of the saint, for proofs against the truth of the tale: but with Protestants, and temperate Catho∣lics, it carries with it self-confutation.</P>
<P>THE waters are indisputably endowed with every good quality attendant on cold baths; and multitudes have here experienced the good effects that thus result from natural qualities, implanted in the several parts of matter by the divine Providence, in order to fulfil his will. Heaven for a short period deigned to convince a dark and obdurate age with a series of miracles; which were de∣livered down to succeeding times, as incontestible proofs of the reality of the divine mission. Without them, a sufficient ground of trust and reliance upon the Supreme Being has long since been established. Second causes innumerable are dispersed throughout the universe, subordinate to the FIRST. Every element proves to us a medicine or a bane, as suits His unerring dispensa∣tion. We cannot want, we cannot have the mediation of poor departed mortals. The supposition would be bestow∣ing on them the attributes of the Deity; omnipresence and omniscience.</P>
<P>SOME eminent botanists of my acquaintance have reduced the sweet moss, and the bloody stains, to mere vegetable produc∣tions, far from being peculiar to our fountain. The first is
<PB N="232" REF="248"/>
that kind of moss called <HI>Jungermannia Asplenioides,</HI> Fl. Angl. 509, <HI>Tour in Wales,</HI> vol. i. tab. 6. imperfectly described and fi∣gured by <HI>Dillenius,</HI> in his history of mosses; which induced us to give a new engraving of it. This species is also found in another holy well in <HI>Caernarvonshire,</HI> called <HI>Ffynnon Llanddeiniolen,</HI> in a parish of the same name.</P>
<P>THE other is a <HI>Byssus,</HI> likewise odoriferous: common to <HI>Lap∣land,</HI> and to other countries besides our own. It adheres to stones in form of fine velvet. <HI>Linnaeus</HI> calls it <HI>Byssus Jolithus</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.

These give shelter to multitudes of <HI>animal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ae.</HI> These, it is probable, eat into the timber, and occasion the ill same our river has obtained of having a corro∣sive quality. Mr. <HI>William Chambers,</HI> of <HI>Holywell,</HI> has assured me that he has seen the penstock and contiguous parts, which lie
<PB N="233" REF="249"/>
always under water, in some parts pierced with a few holes, in others eaten quite thorough; and that the planks appeared, after the moss was separated, as if consuming by the wet rot. He adds, that the moss first adheres to the oaken planks, and then it is that the small grubs eat into them; and in some parts quite penetrate, so that the moss becomes seemingly the nursery or receptacle of the grubs. The method used to preserve the wheels, was by scraping the moss off annually.</P>
<P>THIS account is corroborated by Mr. <HI>Robert Tart,</HI> a very in∣telligent master-carpenter, who says, that the wheels made of the best oak are destroyed remarkably soon by the <HI>Holywell</HI> stream. A wheel which ought to have lasted thirty years, has here been known to become unfit for use in about twelve. Mr. <HI>Tart</HI> recommends wheels made of pine or red deal, and that the surface of the wheels be paid with pitch, tar, and ruddle; but even this has proved ineffectual, for the water occasions the mixture soon to peel away. Mr. <HI>Donbavand</HI> was so sensible of the evil, as to sub∣stitute, instead of timber, wheels of cast-iron in the works which he superintends.</P>
<P>EDWARD DAVIES, an experienced wheel-wright, aged seventy-five, confirms the above; and adds that red deal perishes in the same manner, but in a much slower degree, by reason of its resinous qua∣lity. There have been formerly instances of oaken planks, which had laid long under water, being found as full of holes as if they had been eaten through by <HI>Norway</HI> rats; and were kept as curiosities by the late Messrs. <HI>Barker,</HI> of <HI>Brynmadin,</HI> or <HI>Gadlys.</HI></P>
<P>ON examination of the <HI>animalcula</HI> which occasion this da∣mage, we found them to be the <HI>erucae</HI> or caterpillars of a certain
<PB N="234" REF="250"/>
insect, which deposite its eggs in the moss, the <HI>Hyp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>um riparium, Flora <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cot.</HI> ii. 760. we found them in the state of <HI>erucae,</HI> about a third of an inch long, and of a whitish color.</P>
<P>WE found others arrived to the state of <HI>pupae</HI> or <HI>chrysalides,</HI> of the same length as the caterpillar, and of a deep brown color. Whether these destructive insects are <HI>ephemerae,</HI> or <HI>phryganeae,</HI> of the class of insects which, by a wonderful direction of nature, de∣posite their eggs in waters of different depths, I cannot ascertain. It is certain that these genera, before they assume the insect form, remain under the water. They from the egg become cater∣pillars; these caterpillars rest a certain time in shape of <HI>pupae,</HI> then burst out into flies or insects, after that instantly quit the watery element. In a still day they may be observed to make their appearance, preceded by a bubble: the insect immediately follows, and either takes to the air, or runs along the surface of the water, before it rises into its new habitation.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">CHURCH.</NOTE>ABOVE the well stands the church, dedicated to St. <HI>Wenefrede.</HI> The parish wakes are celebrated in <HI>November,</HI> the time of her translation.

</LIST>
<P>AN account of the tythes will be given in the Appendix, with those of <HI>Whiteford</HI> parish.</P>
<P>THIS vicarage even wants a globe, unless we call the garden to the house by that name. Neither has it any other endowment, unless the share of tithes mentioned in the Appendix, and an ac∣quisition of Queen <HI>Anne</HI>'s bounty of two hundred pounds. This, in the time of the Rev. <HI>Ellis Price,</HI> vicar, received the ad∣dition of two hundred more, which lay at interest till the last year, when, on the donation of a hundred and fifty pounds from <HI>Jesus College,</HI> the whole was laid out in the purchase of a portion of the waste lands in the parish of <HI>Kilken.</HI> An act had been passed in the year 1793, for the purpose of inclosing the common, di∣viding it among the freeholders, and selling certain portions to defray the expences of the act, &amp;c &amp;c. &amp;c. One part was bought with the above sums, and settled on the minister of <HI>Holywell</HI> and his successors, in addition to their income; and say the activity of the present vicar, the ground has already been inclosed, drained, ploughed and sown! The other support of the vicars is the an∣tient one,
<Q><HI>oblationes altaris,</HI> among which are reckoned the of∣ferings
<PB N="237" REF="253"/>
at burials for the pious use of the priest, and the good estate of the soul of the deceased.</Q>
(See <HI>Kennet's Parochial An∣tiquities. Glossary.</HI>) Those of <HI>Holywell</HI> parish amount, <HI>communibus annis,</HI> to eighty pounds.</P>
<P>THE vicarage house, about the middle of this century, became so ruinous as to be uninhabitable. In a few years it was rebuilt by the piety of two brothers, <HI>Thomas</HI> and <HI>John Barker,</HI> of <HI>Bryn∣madyn,</HI> agents to the great smelting-company at <HI>Gadlys,</HI> who be∣queathed to the vicar of <HI>Holywell</HI> 400<HI>l.</HI> for the purpose of build∣ing a new glebe house at <HI>Holywell,</HI> for him and his successors, on the same spot as that on which the old one stood. It was finished in the year 1760, and, with the adjacent premises, has been con∣siderably improved by the present vicar, the Reverend <HI>John Lloyd,</HI> and made a most comfortable residence.</P>
<P>NOT far distant, at the very foot of the hill, above the well,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHURCH.</NOTE> stands the parish church, placed in that inconvenient situation, out of respect to the guardian saint. It has only one bell, and that not to be heard at any distance; so that the congregation is assem∣bled by a walking steeple, a man with a small bell, who sounds the notice through every street.</P>
<P>THE present church was rebuilt in 1769, on the site of the old, and of the same length and breadth, <HI>viz.</HI> the length sixty-eight feet, the breadth fifty-six. It is difficult to ascertain the antient archi∣tecture of this church. Near the entrance, at the west-end, is a door-way, with an obtuse <HI>gothic</HI> arch. The pillars, plain them∣selves, and with plain capitals, which support the gallery on each side of the nave, are original; and by the specimens given by Dr. <HI>Ducarel,</HI> in his <HI>Norman Antiquities,</HI> tab. xiii. appear to have
<PB N="238" REF="254"/>
been in use among the <HI>Saxons</HI> and the <HI>Normans.</HI> The arches, which might have confirmed my suspicion that the church was built in the <HI>Norman</HI> reign, are taken away, but the style con∣tinued till about the year 1200. The church has a nave and two ailes, over which are two handsome galleries; and the whole is supposed to contain three thousand people. It is plain, neat, and calculated for use.</P>
<P>SHOULD it be ever thought necessary to commemorate the re∣pair of the church by an inscription, I would venture to recom∣mend the energetic lines inscribed, on a similar occasion, on a church at <HI>Bristol,</HI> adapting the date and third line to the circum∣stances of that of <HI>Holywell.</HI></P>

<P>UNDER the chancel are the vaults of the <HI>Mostyns</HI> of <HI>Trelacre,</HI> the <HI>Pennants</HI> of <HI>Bagillt,</HI> and the <HI>Pantons</HI> of <HI>Bagillt.</HI> The late <HI>Edward Pennant,</HI> esquire, on the purchase made by me of part of his estate, promised to me his share of these <HI>eternae domus.</HI> He died, and the posthumous gift was in the handsomest manner
<PB N="239" REF="255"/>
transferred to me by <HI>Roger Barnston,</HI> esquire, who afterwards possessed the remainder of his fortunes.</P>
<P>IN the chancel is a neat <HI>caenotoph,</HI> in memory of <HI>Mary,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">MONUMENTS.</NOTE> mother to the late <HI>Edward Pennant,</HI> esquire. The inscription does this lady no more than justice:
<Q>She was prudent, pious, and charitable; in the midst of misfortunes shewed a great example of meekness and humility, of patience and resignation to the will of GOD.</Q>
With the best and most affectionate intent to improve the affairs of her son, she engaged in a partnership with a smelting-company in the neighborhood. The company failed; and the creditors, in an unrelenting manner, pursued the good lady till she was obliged to take shelter in the isle of <HI>Man;</HI> where she died, on the 28th of <HI>February,</HI> 1750, aged forty, and was interred in the church at <HI>Douglas.</HI></P>
<P>ON the wall of the south aile is a small monument in memory of the Reverend <HI>Robert Edwards,</HI> a younger son of <HI>Brynford,</HI> rector of <HI>Halkin,</HI> who died <HI>May</HI> 13th, 1694. Above the inscription are the arms of the house, <HI>viz.</HI> field vert, a cheveron between three wolves heads argent, erased, with the lion, the arms of <HI>Tudor Trevor,</HI> empaled. The first denotes the descent of the family of <HI>Brynford</HI> from <HI>Ririd Vlaidd,</HI> lord of <HI>Penllyn,</HI> &amp;c. killed in battle at the latter end of the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> II.</P>
<P>ON the wall at the end of the same aile, is a flat stone, with twelve quarterings, all faithfully copied from those over the chimney-piece in the dining-parlor at <HI>Mostyn.</HI> This belonged
<PB N="240" REF="256"/>
to the <HI>Mostyns</HI> of <HI>Calcoed,</HI> who, by virtue of their descent (of which more in another place) have a right to the first coat. The rest appertain only to Sir <HI>Roger Mostyn,</HI> especially those of <HI>Edwyn,</HI> gained by the marriage of <HI>Jevan</HI> with the heiress of <HI>Mostyn;</HI> those of <HI>Gloddaeth,</HI> gained by the heiress of <HI>Gloddaeth;</HI> and those of <HI>Tregarnedd,</HI> gained by the heiress of <HI>Ednefydd Vychan:</HI> to each of which none could have a right but the <HI>Mostyns</HI> of <HI>Mostyn,</HI> and their heirs. On one side is a shield argent, with four bars azure; in the first, three shieldrakes; in the second and third, two; and in the fourth one: these evidently variations of the coat, (see p. 30.) Beneath is <HI>Hodie mi, cras tibi.</HI> On the other side, be∣neath the arms of <HI>Philip Phycdan,</HI> is <HI>Virtus semper vivit.</HI></P>
<P>THE same errors reign in the arms of <HI>Thomas Mostyn,</HI> of <HI>Stokyn.</HI> They are almost the same with the preceding: the date is 1658. I shall not repeat here what I have said at p. 186, of the possessors of <HI>Stokyn.</HI></P>
<P>ON a pillar in the north aile are the very same arms over the seat of the <HI>Williams</HI>'s of <HI>Trellynian,</HI> with this motto:
<Q><L>H XPE M</L>
<L>Labe meâ morior, sanguine vivo tuo.</L></Q></P>
<P>THE arms of <HI>Trellynian</HI> are those of <HI>Idnerth,</HI> lord of <HI>Maes∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rook,</HI> a boar's head in chief, on the arms of <HI>Edwyn,</HI> lord of <HI>Te∣gengl.</HI> Probably the pillar and the seat had been transferred to the <HI>Williams</HI>'s by some descendant from the house of <HI>Tudor Trevor;</HI> perhaps a <HI>Mostyn</HI> of <HI>Hen-Blâs,</HI> in <HI>Brynford,</HI> now the pro∣perty of Sir <HI>Roger Mostyn.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="241" REF="257"/>A FOURTH flat stone, smaller than the preceding, is placed in the wall of the north aile: on it is inscribed the following epitaph:

<P>JOHN PENNANT was second in descent from <HI>Nicholas Pennant,</HI> last abbot of <HI>Basingwerk;</HI> and was married to <HI>Margaret,</HI> daughter of <HI>Hugh Mostyn,</HI> younger son of <HI>Pyers Mostyn,</HI> of <HI>Trelacre.</HI> His arms are the three shieldrakes quarterly with those of Sir <HI>Robert Pounderling,</HI> constable of <HI>Desert</HI> castle, and of Sir <HI>Griffith Llwyd,</HI> mentioned before at p. 31. He was great-grand-father to <HI>Mary Pennant,</HI> who conveyed into our house the <HI>Holywell</HI> and <HI>Merton Abbot</HI> estates, by her marriage with <HI>David Pennant</HI> of <HI>Bychton.</HI></P>
<P>IN rebuilding the church was found the headless figure of a priest, in his sacerdotal habit, and with a chalice in his hand. He is supposed to have been <HI>Thomas,</HI> second son of <HI>Thomas ap David,</HI> abbot of <HI>Basingwerk;</HI> whom I find in the <HI>Bagillt</HI> pedegree to have been vicar of <HI>Holywell.</HI></P>
<P>THE steeple is plain and square, very strongly built, but without any mark to denote the time of its being built.</P>
<P>THE church-yard is the worst in the whole diocese.<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHURCH-YARD.</NOTE> A small part is a gentle slope, but the greater almost precipitous; so that after any continuance of wet weather, a fall may happen pro∣ductive of the most indecent and horrible spectacles.</P>
<P>THE number of inhabitants in this parish may be from 7 to 8000. There are about 1000 houses in the whole parish,<NOTE PLACE="marg">NUMBER OF PEOPLE.</NOTE> of

The first, or the Old Club, was formed on <HI>March</HI> 7th, 1751: so that it is prior to our's by fifteen years. It consists at present of 214 members.</P>
<P>CLUB the second consists of 170 members, and was formed <HI>January</HI> 27th, 1759.</P>
<P>CLUB the third is composed of 160 members, and commenced on <HI>January</HI> 21st, 1775. Each of these clubs have their rules, but so similar to those of <HI>Whiteford</HI> parish, that I shall not repeat them. I shall only remark, <HI>ne quid detrimenti ecclesia capiat,</HI> that there is an article which excludes every one who is not of the true church of <HI>England</HI> by law established, unless with the approbation of the majority.</P>
<P>THE UNION CLUB was established in <HI>April,</HI> 1789.<NOTE PLACE="marg">UNION CLUB.</NOTE>It is com∣posed of forty-two members, in general the most respectable in∣habitants of the parish, untainted with despotic or jacobinical prin∣ciples.

Adjoining, in a room of retreat, in the intervals of play, the persons out, took their pipe and ale, or perhaps a small bowl of punch: for in those plain days wine was seldom called for, unless by the few with whom other liquors might disagree <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><L>In these days, alas! our native liquor is banished from most tables!</L>
<L>Ah! redeant SATURNIA regna!</L></NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN the town are three places of worship besides the church, two for the <HI>Roman Catholics,</HI> and one for dissenters. The last was built on my ground, by lease dated <HI>April</HI> 16, 1788, and is maintained by voluntary contributions. Of the former, one supports a secular or parish priest. The other a gentleman of the late order of Jesuits. Both of their cures are endowed with lands vested in trustees. Each of their houses had been a species of hotel, probably de∣signed for the reception of pilgrims of better rank. One was called the <HI>Cross-keys,</HI> the other the <HI>Star.</HI> I remember at one or other of them <HI>Edward</HI> duke of <HI>Norfolk,</HI> and other visitants of distinction.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">BRYN Y CASTELL.</NOTE>ABOVE the church is a hill called <HI>Bryn y Castell,</HI> narrow and very steep on the sides, projecting at the end over the little valley.
<PB N="245" REF="261"/>
On this might have stood the castle of <HI>Treffynnon,</HI> or St. <HI>Wenefrede,</HI> built by <HI>Randle</HI> III. earl of <HI>Chester,</HI> in the year 1210 <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Powel,</HI> 262.</NOTE>. There are not at present any vestiges left.</P>
<P>IT is singular that no mention is made in the <HI>Doomsday-Book</HI> of either chapel, church, or well; yet townships now of less note are named; such as <HI>Brunford, Caldecote,</HI> and others. Notwith∣standing bishop <HI>Fleetwood</HI>'s opinion, I think the legend of St. <HI>Wenefrede</HI> was known previous to that survey; for the very name of <HI>Holywell</HI> is <HI>Saxon,</HI> probably bestowed on it before the Conquest, on account of the imputed sanctity of the well.</P>
<P>THE spring is certainly one of the finest in these kingdoms; and, by the two different trials and calculations lately made for my information, is found to fling out about twenty-one tons of water in a minute. It never freezes. In respect to the equality of the water in droughts, or after the greatest rains, I find I must place it among the vulgar errors. From the authority of Mr. <HI>Christopher Smalley,</HI> and other respectable manufacturers on the stream, I discover that the variation is extremely great, and that there is a decrease in summer of more than one-third, and in great droughts of still more, and after violent rains the increase is in like proportion: some even say it is one-half. As long as I remember, the fountain, after heavy falls of wet, became of a wheyey color. This is increased to a great degree, grows more turbid, and even deposits a mud upon the stones.</P>
<P>THE town was also very inconsiderable till the beginning of this century; the houses few, and those for the most part

<P>THE market is the best in the county for butcher's meat. That for corn is now much reduced, by reason of the greater farmers, or the badgers or purchasers for exportation, lessening the great stock which used to supply the markets at reasonable rates. Every great farmer seems now to have taken the early part of his education in Change-Alley, and is as expert in prices of corn, as any academy of that noted place is in those of stocks. That there never can be a deficiency for the use of the natives of <HI>Flintshire,</HI> either from their own lands, or the vale of <HI>Clwyd,</HI> is evident from the following table of exportation, from <HI>September</HI> 1, 1794, to <HI>August</HI> 5th, 1795; communicated to me by the friendship of the gentlemen of the custom-house in <HI>Ches∣ter,</HI> from which appear the following truths:

<P>THE situation of the town is pleasant and healthy. On the back is a lofty hill, at times extremely productive of lead-ore. Towards the sea is a pretty valley, bounded by woods: the end finishes on one side with the venerable abby. To such who require the use of a cold-bath, few places are more proper; for, besides the excellence of the waters, exceeding good medical assistance, and comfortable accommodations, may be found here; and the mind entertained, and the body exercised in a variety of beautiful rides and walks.</P>

ending at the late Mr. <HI>Henry Steeple</HI>'s wall, where the parish of <HI>Whiteford</HI> begins. Above the west end stands the <HI>Grange,</HI> which was called <HI>Feilebrock</HI> (and also <HI>Fulibrock.</HI>) The <HI>Grange</HI> still re∣mains a farm-house in a most ruinous condition. It is the pro∣perty of Sir <HI>Pyers Mostyn,</HI> but formerly belonged to the abby of <HI>Basingwerk,</HI> having been granted to them by <HI>Meredeth Wawor,</HI> of which <HI>Dugdale,</HI> (i. 721) gives the following account, in the charter of <HI>David ap Llewelyn,</HI> prince of <HI>North Wales:</HI>

<P>THE <HI>Holywell</HI> level was begun in 1774,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE> under leases granted by Sir <HI>Pyers Mostyn,</HI> baronet, myself, <HI>Peter Parry,</HI> esquire, <HI>Ed∣ward Jones,</HI> esquire, and Mrs. <HI>Mary Williams,</HI> of <HI>Trelunniau.</HI> I and my two sons made the voyage of this important venture on <HI>September</HI> 21st, 1795, and took boat, or rather punt, at the en∣trance into the work in <HI>Coed Cae Dentir,</HI> a field belonging to Sir <HI>Pyers,</HI> on the north side of a small dingle opening into the road opposite to the great cotton factory. Under the pilotage of the honest <HI>Thomas Edwards,</HI> agent to the mine, we entered the mouth, lighted by candles, stuck on each side of our vessel. The first forty yards of our way was arched with stone, and so low as to oblige us to stoop. When the arch ceased, the roof was the natural rock, of that species called <HI>shale.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE> The height begins now to be six feet; the breadth four; the depth of the water, included in the height, is two and a half. After passing in the shaley stratum about two hundred and twenty-six yards, we find it is succeeded

Several shafts have been sunk for air between this place and the mouth of the level. In a field of mine, called <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dlas <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r,</HI> was early discovered, at the depth of thirty-one yards, a strong string of ore, which raised the hopes of the adventurers to the highest degree; and the mineral stock rose in proportion. But alas! in a little time, both spirits and stock fell; for the pro∣mising prospect suddenly vanished, an accident too frequent with miners to occasion surprize. The chert continues to a little beyond the turnpike-road, when we again enter the land of Sir <HI>Pyers Mostyn,</HI> in a field called <HI>Brocknallt,</HI> where it stops. Hitherto the level has preserved a strait course:<NOTE PLACE="marg">LIME STONE.</NOTE> but in this field (where the lime-stone stratum begins, and is continued to the end of the present work∣ing, above five hundred yards) it takes a bend parallel to the road, and so continues as far as <HI>Brocknallt-pella,</HI> and then makes another curvature, and near a small but pretty cave crosses obliquely the turnpike-road.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A CAVE.</NOTE> The cave is furnished with a table and benches, at which the visitants never fail experiencing the hospitality of their worthy conductor. Out of this cave is a passage, or sump, or short shaft, sunk for the purpose both of searching for ore, and also for conveying of air, which began to be wanted, into the level. This sump communicates with seve∣ral others, till it reaches a shaft. The action of the air is various, sometimes it descends through the shaft;<NOTE PLACE="marg">VE<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>TILATOR.</NOTE> at other times rushes up the mouth of the level; but in each case passes into the mouth of a square wooden conductor, which enters the lower part of the sump, and is continued on one side of the level, al∣most to the end of the present working.</P>
<P><PB N="251" REF="267"/>IN proceeding farther we were alarmed with the awful sound of a cataract. On arriving at the spot from whence it issued, the noise seemed to have derived its greatest force from the confined arch of the level;<NOTE PLACE="marg">CASCADE.</NOTE> for we discovered it to proceed from a small but elegant cascade, which, in our sight, tumbled down a small hollow, and served to augment the water of the level, which was also increased by several strong springs rising from the sides and bottom with strong ebullitions.<NOTE PLACE="marg">OTHER SUBTER∣RANEOUS WA∣TERS.</NOTE> Similar noises are said to have been heard in <HI>Coetiau'r Odyn.</HI> It is possible that this subterraneous water may be one of the feeds of St. <HI>Wenefrede</HI>'s well, as the field is nearly in a descending line with it. I have also heard, on good authority, of another large stream of water running through a great subterraneous cavern, in working <HI>Portaway</HI> mine, in <HI>Pantasa,</HI> in the parish of <HI>Whiteford,</HI> but its discharge has never been yet discovered.—But to return. After passing this fall, we reached the end of our voyage, at the length of 1167 yards from the mouth, and at the place where two miners were pursuing the working of the level, and had got within ten yards of the shaft in which the miners are working in the rich vein, beneath the field called <HI>Coed Cae Plwm,</HI> or the wood or field of lead. The height from the sole of the level to the surface at this place is ninety-three yards and a half; the depth of the shaft, which is now so flattering to our hopes, is fifty yards; so that there are forty-three yards and a half from its sole to that of the level, which all the way is found to be filled with ore!!!</P>

<P>FROM the other side of the road the ground rises steeply; on the summit is a tract of inclosed land, backed by the mountain or common.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">PEN-Y-BAL ROAD.</NOTE>I RETURN into the town, and at the end of <HI>Whiteford-street</HI> ascend the steep road called <HI>Pen-y-Bal,</HI> of very laborious ascent. I remember it the only coach approach on this side. The pre∣sent fine road, then with great propriety called <HI>Holloway,</HI> was too narrow for any carriage beyond the then wretched carts of the country. I well remember that whenever our family wanted to visit <HI>Holywell,</HI> it was obliged to be dragged up to <HI>Pen-y-fordd-waen,</HI>
<PB N="253" REF="269"/>
to cross the mountain, and with locked wheel, and with great peril, go down the almost precipitous way.</P>
<P>FROM the summit of <HI>Pen y-Bal,</HI> to the west,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CALCOLD.</NOTE> is a narrow tract of common.

<P>ON the mountain to the east of the common way to <HI>Calcoed,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">NAID-Y-MARCH.</NOTE> are two stones, about three feet high, and about twenty-two feet distant from each other. They are called <HI>Naid-y-March,</HI> or the horse's leap, from a vulgar notion of the derivation of the name. They are of the very antient <HI>British</HI> origin, and probably the place of interment of some hero whose body was deposited between stone and stone. The distance might be intended to give an idea of his mighty size; as <HI>Alexander</HI> is supposed, on his return out of <HI>India,</HI> to have buried various suits of armor, of gigantic dimen∣sions, to impose on future times an exalted notion of the troops he had led to this distant country.</P>
<P>I DESCEND again into <HI>Holywell,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">HALKIN AND BRYNFORD ROADS.</NOTE> and at the south end of the <HI>High Street</HI> turn to the right, up the road which leads to <HI>Halkin</HI> and <HI>Brynford;</HI> the latter branches from that to <HI>Halkin</HI> on the right.

<P>IN order to proceed towards the rich mineral country I am entering on, I shall continue the enumeration of veins from <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>etiau'r Odyn</HI> (see p. 241.)</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">MEI<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> AND OTHER MINES.</NOTE>THE next to that, eastward, is <HI>Caleb Bell,</HI> a north and south vein, which is traced from the east side of <HI>Pen-y-Bal,</HI> descends from the mountain, towards the late <HI>John Denman</HI>'s, but as yet has not been traced to the road. This has in old times been very rich in several places.</P>
<P>THE old vein, or <HI>Pant Ithel,</HI> is another rich vein, which first
<PB N="255" REF="271"/>
appeared in <HI>Pantasa,</HI> and yielded great quantities of ore and ca∣lamine. From thence crosses <HI>Butler's fields,</HI> and <HI>Pen-y-Bal,</HI> and then to <HI>Coetia fawr;</HI> from thence to <HI>Pant Ithel,</HI> where it de∣scends near <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ynford</HI> house, and crosses the road into <HI>Highgate</HI> te∣nement, the property of Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> of <HI>Trelunnian.</HI> It then enters into my tenement called <HI>Meilwr,</HI> and was the first place in which ore was found in the level; the lease of which was granted by my father, on <HI>December</HI> the 20th, 1754.</P>
<P>THE next is the <HI>Highgate</HI> vein, which about <HI>Pistill</HI> had branch∣ed into many strings. As they advance from <HI>Pistill</HI> eastward, they enter <HI>Highgate</HI> tenement, and become very productive, both in Mrs. <HI>Williams</HI>'s land, and also my own, which for many years poured on me in great abundance its mineral wealth. I never considered this species of riches but of the most precarious nature, liable instantly to fail: I therefore secured them on the best of tenures, and purchased with them the moiety of the <HI>Bagillt-Hall</HI> estate, which has turned out to me uncommonly fortunate. I also was enabled by another part to improve my house at <HI>Downing</HI> to what it now is.</P>
<P>EVERY thing has its end. The vein or veins at length grew poorer. A great fire-engine was erected a few years ago, in hopes of clearing the water, and getting at the ore which was supposed to have been left in the soles.</P>
<P>THE level begins at the bottom of the north side of <HI>Nant∣hill-brwc,</HI> and runs south-west. How uncertain is mineral know∣lege, even among the most knowing! The object of the lessees was the working up to a certain rich vein, named the <HI>hard shaft,</HI> in the lands belonging to <HI>Brynfordd.</HI> An object that never
<PB N="256" REF="272"/>
yet has been obtained. But in pursuit of that object they most unexpectedly met with the veins which produced so much wealth to Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> and myself. Perhaps I fall short in my estimate if I say, that to lessors and lessees, the total amount must have exceeded a hundred thousand pounds.</P>
<P>THE next vein to the <HI>high-gate,</HI> is a string within five yards of the <HI>high gate,</HI> which his been very productive. Into the field called <HI>Coetia Yscubor,</HI> the <HI>hard shaft</HI> vein is expected to enter, and cross the whole breadth, into the ground of <HI>Pen y pylle.</HI> And at the very corner of the same field, another vein crosses into the same land, and has been tolerably rich.</P>
<P>I NOW quit my mineral territories in this part of the country; and cross over the road to <HI>Pen y pylle,</HI> the seat of <HI>Hugh Hum∣phreys,</HI> esquire, descended from <HI>Edwyn,</HI> prince of <HI>Tegengl.</HI> That gentleman has had large share of the mineral wealth. The vein <HI>Rest y cegin</HI> passes under his very house and garden. The mine-hillocks fill the land: but by his judicious walks and plantations, which now cover them, he has turned them into beauties. The vein continues to his grounds, below his house, and may probably be a source of new wealth.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Lucky Venture,</HI> is the last vein I can mention in this pa∣rish, which ranges from the mountain, and crosses the road into a corner of a field of Mr. <HI>Humphreys,</HI> and immediately from thence into the land belonging to <HI>Edward Jones,</HI> esquire, of <HI>Wepre,</HI> in which abundance of ore has been got. Much has also been got in the very road, in a pit sunk by earl <HI>Grosvenor,</HI> a privilege clamed by his lordship, in virtue of his great mineral grant?</P>
<P><PB N="257" REF="273"/>THIS township ends at about a mile distance from <HI>Pen y pylle,</HI> where it is separated by <HI>Rh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> a little <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll, from the parish of <HI>Halkin.</HI></P>
<P>I RETURN again into the town,<NOTE PLACE="marg">GADLYS ROAD</NOTE> and after crossing the east end of the <HI>High Street,</HI> take the road leading toward <HI>Gadlys.</HI> On the right I see a trifling monument of my respect to a town which has for a long series of years shewn every mark of esteem for the landlord of many, and the friend of all. In an adjacent field of mine, called <HI>Roft T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>b,</HI> was a valuable spring, which running to waste, occasioned a great loss of time, to rich and poor, in pro∣curing water. I (by the assistance of Mr. <HI>Denbavand</HI>) caused, in the year 1794, a pillar to be erected, into which the water was collected, and raised to a height convenient to be received into vessels placed there, to supply, with ease and expedition, the wants of the inhabitants.</P>
<P>AT the bottom of the descent from <HI>Holywell</HI> is a beautiful din∣gle, named <HI>Nant-hil-brwe,</HI> which winds on the right to <HI>Meilwr</HI> tenement, and on the left quite to the marsh, the greater part of the way ornamented with hanging woods. On crossing a bridge near a large mill, the property of <HI>Paul Panton,</HI> esquire,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BAGILLT TOWN∣SHIP.</NOTE> enter the township of <HI>Bagillt;</HI> and in less than half a mile pass by the house of that worthy friend of mine. Our intimacy began in early youth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">HOUSE THE PAN∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> and has been ever since retained. With joy I see his eldest son rising with progressive goodness, and rare abilities. I see with pleasure my eldest son, with true judgment, cultivating with him a friendship. May it continue through a long life of human felicity, pleasant to themselves, and useful to their neighbors and country!</P>

<P>THE antient smelting-house of <HI>Gadlys</HI> stood a full mile distant from this house, about a mile distant from the shore, and on the land of <HI>Robert Hughes,</HI> esquire, of <HI>Halkin.</HI> The lease expired
<PB N="261" REF="277"/>
in 1786, and the works were pulled entirely down, after standing the term of the agreement, which was forty-four years.</P>
<P>THE respectable company, long known by the name of the <HI>Governor and Company for smelting down Lead with Pit Coale and Sea Coale,</HI> by the royal charter, granted in the 4th of <HI>William</HI> and <HI>Mary,</HI> began business in this county about the year 1700. They flourished with a most fair reputation for a great number of years, till their decline, either through want of ore, or other in∣evitable causes, induced them to remove their antient furnaces to some works, built by the late Messrs. <HI>Smedley,</HI> on the bank above <HI>Bagillt.</HI> Those they purchased; and continued smelting, un∣der the direction of their agent, Mr. <HI>William Smith</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">To whom I am much indebted for information respecting the <HI>Gadly:</HI> company.</NOTE>, till they sold them to Messrs. <HI>Griffith</HI> and <HI>Astet,</HI> of <HI>London.</HI> This company was often called the <HI>Quakers Company,</HI> from the number of per∣sons of that mild persuasion being of it.</P>
<P>DURING the prosperity of the works (which was very long) they produced vast quantities of lead and bullion; of the latter they extracted from the lead, between the year 1704 and 1744, not less than 430,604 ounces. Queen <HI>Anne</HI> and her successor commanded that all specie coined from the silver should be struck on the reverse with the plume of feathers, as a mark of its having been the production of the principality <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Leake on Coin, <HI>287.</HI></NOTE>. <HI>James</HI> I. gave the same directions respecting the coin made from the silver of the mines worked by Sir <HI>Hugh Middleton,</HI> in <HI>Cardi∣ganshire;</HI> and in 1637, <HI>Charles</HI> I. caused the same marks of <HI>Welsh</HI> silver to be placed on the coins of the mint at <HI>Aberystwith,</HI> ob∣tained
<PB N="262" REF="278"/>
from the mines of the same county <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Leake on Coins, <HI>302.</HI></NOTE>. Other coins from the company's works were called <HI>quakers money,</HI> from the cause above assigned. In an antient map of <HI>Denbighshire</HI> and <HI>Flintshire,</HI> by <HI>W. Williams,</HI> published in 1720, is an engraving of a crown, with the feathers, the <HI>insignia</HI> of <HI>Wales;</HI> and also another, of the seal of the corporation, with its crest and arms. The supporters are two miners; and the motto the apt one, <HI>Spectatur in igne.</HI> And above them is a view of the works, faithfully given, as they appeared before they were reduced to a single chimney.</P>
<P>THE company were for a long series of years the greatest mine-adventurers in <HI>North Wales,</HI> and had very considerable mines in every part of <HI>Flintshire.</HI> The company disposed of their remain∣ing property in the county, and totally withdrew from it at <HI>Mi∣chaelma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> 1792; but still they carry on very extensive mines and smelting-works in <HI>Cumberland</HI> and <HI>Northumberland,</HI> under the commissioners of <HI>Greenwich</HI> hospital, on the forfeited estates of the earl of <HI>Derwentwater.</HI></P>
<P>GADLYS takes its name from the <HI>Welsh, Câd,</HI> an army, and <HI>Llys,</HI> signifying the royal head quarter, or palace. Near the works stood a large mount, on which might have been a castelet, the residence of some of our princes.</P>
<P>BETWEEN this place and <HI>Pentre Bagillt</HI> is another eminence of antient celebrity, <HI>Bryn Dychwelwch,</HI> so named from <HI>Bryn, a hill,</HI> and <HI>Dychwelwch, return!</HI> being traditionally said to have been the place from which <HI>Henry</HI> II. gave his order for retreat, when he was engaged with the <HI>Welsh,</HI> in 1157, with his whole army, in <HI>Coleshill,</HI> in the same difficulties as he had just
<PB N="263" REF="279"/>
before experienced in the depth of <HI>Coed Eulo.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">BATTLE OF COLESHILL.</NOTE> In this action his forces were again defeated, and <HI>Eustace Fitz John,</HI> a baron first in rank, wealth, and abilities among the <HI>English;</HI> and <HI>Robert de Courci,</HI> another great baron, with numbers of others, were slain. <HI>Henry de Essex,</HI> hereditary standard-bearer, and a man of ap∣proved valor, was seized with a panic; and flinging down the standard, cried out, that the king was killed! The route would have been general, if the king had not valiantly rallied his forces and repulsed the <HI>Welsh;</HI> but in the end he thought it prudent to withdraw his army, and encamp in a secure station. He after∣wards attempted, by decamping from the shore, and endeavoring to get into the interior part of the country, to cut off <HI>Owen</HI>'s re∣treat into the mountains <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Powel,</HI> p. 207.</NOTE>. But the wise prince, penetrating into his views, retired to a plain near <HI>St. Asaph,</HI> still called <HI>Cîl Owen,</HI> or <HI>Owen's Retreat,</HI> and from thence to a strong post named <HI>Bryn-y-Pin,</HI> defended by great ramparts and ditches. This camp lies in the parish of St. <HI>George,</HI> on a lofty rock above the church, and is now called <HI>Pen y Pare.</HI></P>

All that human wit could invent, should be practised to prevent their eluding the attempt to reduce grain to a price which might afford an honest profit to the farmer, and yet enable him to supply the poor laborer at a rate which might give him power, not only to feed his family, but to cloath them with decent rayment, an article co-essential to their comfort, and to their health.</P>
<P><PB N="265" REF="281"/>AS a house of industry is now in contemplation by the parish of <HI>Holywell,</HI> is there not a possibility of allotting certain portions of the waste lands for sale, to raise a fund to carry on the work, or to give in mortgage to such persons who may be willing to advance money for so salutary a purpose?</P>
<P>THE town of <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> and I may say of every manufactur∣ing county, have succeeded to admiration in their attempts, and should be examples to us. This neighborhood is now filled with men of business, capable of the conduct of such works: besides, the cotton and twist company have it in their power to expend annually above £. 1800 in the town, in picking the cotton; but from the dislike of the poor to that employ, are obliged to send the materials to distant places (see p. 216.) whereby the town and neighborhood lose the expenditure of that great sum among them. We squires are less qualified for operations which require vigor and activity, but we can contribute countenance and power, equally essential to the sup∣port of the design. I know the poor will be averse to it at first: but when they recollect how long they had starved under the careless care of overseers, and that they will be placed under the immediate attention of visitors consisting of their neighbors, and that they will not be removed beyond the reach of their friends and relations, whom they may see at proper times, I trust they will be satisfied. To banish the poor from the possibility of the occa∣sional comfort of their dearest relatives, would be unspeakable cruelty. I, therefore, must ever condemn a county house of in∣dustry, in which that essential consolation is made difficult or im∣possible, to the inmates from distant parts.</P>
<P><PB N="266" REF="282"/><NOTE PLACE="marg">VITRIOL-WORKS.</NOTE>ON gaining the summit of this road, appears a vitriol-work, the property of Mr. <HI>Donbavand,</HI> placed under the care of Mr. <HI>John Jones,</HI> of <HI>Holywell,</HI> an able chymist. His operations are di∣rected to three articles: blue vitriol, or vitriol of copper, which is made by dissolving copper in oil of vitriol or acid of sulphur. After the solution has taken place, the produce is dissolved in boiling water, evaporated down to a given weight, and put in coolers to evaporate.</P>
<P>THE use of this species of vitriol is in dying cottons of a green or olive color, and hats and woollen cloths black; and also for making green verditer for painting in oil or water-colors,<NOTE PLACE="marg">VERDITER.</NOTE> by precipitation with whiting.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">SUGAR OF LEAD</NOTE>THE last article is sugar of lead, or <HI>saccharum saturni,</HI> which is lead dissolved in distilled vinegar. When the vinegar is satu∣rated with the lead, it is boiled down to a given weight, and, like the blue vitriol, is put in coolers to crystallize. For the purpose of making the wort for the vinegar, twelve hundred hobbets of barley or malt had been employed in a single year; but in the late season of scarcity the proprietor totally desisted from this branch of business.</P>
<P>SUGAR of lead is used in the cotton printing business, for fixing the colors in the stuff dyed or printed. Such I believe to be the sole application of it from these works; but from others nearer to the capital I fear a most criminal one is frequently in practice, (for it is a most dangerous poison) I mean that of using it in the refining of white wines, or in restoring the sweetness to such which are grown sour: for this drug is the sweetest of all sweet things. It occasions to the drinkers of wines thus restored,

or rather thus endowed with the powers of poison, numbers of maladies they cannot account for, such as colics, obstinate cos∣tiveness, and paralytic affections of the limbs. Finally, we may add death itself. The fatal dinner at <HI>Salt Hill,</HI> on <HI>March</HI> 27th, 1773, which ended in the destruction of several gentle∣men, supposed to have been caused by wine impregnated with this fatal drug, has been much talked of. I believe that not to have been the case. The gentlemen did not sicken till after several days. One (Mr. <HI>Pote,</HI> who had drank as the rest did) never was infected. It happened that he walked in the garden during the time a most miserable object, a pauper, had been examined, from whom the pestilential <HI>miasmata</HI> of a fever, probably of the nature of the jail-fever, had diffused themselves among the company present; for all, except Mr. <HI>Pote,</HI> sickened <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Gent.

In this instance the vintners may be cleared; but since it is probable that numbers of people fall victims to their art, I wish legislature would frame a law to condemn them, not to the halter, but to the more apt punishment of swallowing a competent draught of their own <HI>Stygian</HI> liquor. <HI>Nec lex est justior ulla!</HI>—Bishop <HI>Watson</HI> (iii. 369) says, that in <HI>Germany</HI> such adulteration is punished with death.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">LORD PENRHYN.</NOTE>MY respected, but remote kinsman, <HI>Richard Pennant,</HI> baron <HI>Penrhyn,</HI> sprung from this branch of our family. He is ninth in descent from the abbot, and third from <HI>Gifford Pennant,</HI> second son of <HI>Edward Pennant,</HI> of <HI>Bagillt,</HI> by <HI>Catherine,</HI> daughter of <HI>Edward Kynaston,</HI> of <HI>Otely,</HI> in the county of <HI>Salop.</HI> He went to <HI>Jamaica,</HI> in the time of <HI>Oliver Cromwel;</HI> had a grant of lands there <HI>November</HI> 5th, 1665; settled in the parish of <HI>Clarendon,</HI> and died in 1677. His lordship's property in that island is immense, and his addition to it in the county of <HI>Caernarvon,</HI> in this his native island, is very considerable, by his marriage with <HI>Anne Susanna,</HI> daughter and heiress of the late general <HI>Warburton,</HI> of <HI>Winnington,</HI> in <HI>Cheshire.</HI> With singular fortune, by this match his lordship pos∣sesses <HI>Penrhyn,</HI> the seat and estate belonging to the family of <HI>Angbarad,</HI> his distant ancestress; from whom lady <HI>Penrhyn</HI> is by her grandmother also descended. All these fortunes they enjoy with dignity, and with utility to their numerous tenantry. I particularly allude to those about <HI>Penrhyn,</HI> where he has made
<PB N="271" REF="288"/>
his vast slate-quarries an object of admiration to travellers, pro∣fitable to himself, and the source of opulence to the surrounding country. I had not, at the publication of my <HI>Welsh Tour,</HI> oppor∣tunity of informing myself about these important works; I, there∣fore, give a brief sketch of their history.</P>
<P>WHEN his lordship came to possession of his fortunes in part of the island, he found great appearance of neglect and poverty among the tenantry; the slate-quarries, one great staple of the country, in a very low state; and the export of that valuable article did not annually exceed a thousand tons; and there were not four carts on his estate, and only three in all <HI>Nant-Frankon,</HI> and the roads scarcely passable for a horse. By his judicious management a happy reverse took place. The carriages have encreased to the present time, to rather more than a hundred broad-wheel carts and waggons.</P>
<P>PORT <HI>Penrhyn,</HI> formerly <HI>Aber-cegid,</HI> is now highly improved by quays for the reception of vessels; so that those of two hun∣dred tons burden can lie close to them, and take in their cargo. Vessels of above three hundred tons can enter the port, but cannot get close to the quays.</P>
<P>BEFORE the country experienced his lordship's improving ta∣lents, not above a thousand tons have been exported in the year. In 1794 the export amounted to fifteen thousand. In 1795 there was every reasonable hope that it would have increased to twenty thousand, but the tax on the slates has given it a check; though it is expected that the return of peace, and a modification of the duty, will restore the progress of the trade.</P>
<P><PB N="272" REF="289"/>THE state-quarries are a few miles from the port, near the entrance into <HI>Na<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t-Frankon.</HI> From four to five hundred men are employed in them. They live in very elegant cottages, prettily disposed in groups. Here is a butcher and a shoe-maker, but no corrupting ale-house is permitted. His lordship has built a mar∣ket house, so that the workmen need not wander for the necessary provisions. Let me not forget that he erected an elegant pa∣vilion, called <HI>Ogwen Bank,</HI> with a kitchen, stables, &amp;c. which lord and lady <HI>Penrhyn</HI> often visit, either to examine into this creation of theirs, or to amuse their guests.</P>
<P>HIS lordship was elected member for <HI>Petersfield,</HI> in the first parlement of his present majesty; and in 1767 vacated his seat to be elected for <HI>Leverpool.</HI> He was returned in 1768, 1774, and again in 1784. In that arduous situation, his lordship dis∣charged his trust with zeal, abilities, and fidelity.</P>
<P>EDWARD PENNANT, the last owner of <HI>Bagillt,</HI> and last of the male line (lord <HI>Penrhyn</HI> excepted) died at <HI>Marseilles,</HI> on <HI>March</HI> 2d, 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>8; and was there interred. In 1766 he disposed of to me by sale all the estates in the township of <HI>Holywell.</HI> And soon after he retired into <HI>France,</HI> he bequeathed the remainder of his for∣tunes to his cousin <HI>Thomas Cratchley,</HI> who dying, left them to <HI>Roger Barnston,</HI> esquire, of <HI>Chester.</HI></P>

His family,
<PB N="273" REF="290"/>
and two other families not remote from him, had long possessed respectable freeholds of fifty pounds a-year each.
<Q>Time and chance happeneth to all men.</Q>
Our humble curate is far distanced by the other two. He remains a drudge in his pro∣fession, <HI>honestâ pauperie,</HI> resulting from fraternal affection, in ex∣erting every nerve to support two sisters, who rest on him for the poor pittance he can afford to give.</P>
<P>AFTER passing the turnpike-gate, I find myself on the conti∣nuance of the turnpike-road from <HI>Greenfield</HI> to <HI>Flint.</HI> The dis∣tance from the <HI>Greenfield</HI> gate to <HI>Flint</HI> is only four miles. Let me add, that within little more than one mile from the fountain of <HI>St. Wenefrede,</HI> at <HI>Holywell,</HI> to the gate just mentioned, <HI>Britain</HI> may be challenged to shew, on an equal space, a similar assemblage of commercial buildings, or of capitals employed in erecting and in carrying on their several objects. I refer the reader back to p. 203, for an account of those upon the <HI>Holywell</HI> stream. I re∣sume the chain of commerce, from the copper-forge, the lowest link, which reaches to the very road.</P>
<P>A LITTLE to the right of the turnpike-gate, the little rill <HI>Nant-hil-brwe</HI> divides the small township of <HI>Whelstone</HI> from that of <HI>Holywell.</HI> This tract, of which I have the tythes, is one of the portions of <HI>Bagillt</HI> township, which is very large, and subdi∣vided into two others, <HI>Bagillt-sawr,</HI> and <HI>Bagillt-fechan.</HI></P>
<P>ON the side of the rill stand the works called the <HI>River Bank,</HI> established on my land, by lease dated <HI>September</HI> 22, 1785,<NOTE PLACE="marg">RIVER BANK WORKS.</NOTE> granted to Messrs. <HI>William Roe</HI> and <HI>Edward Hawkins.</HI> These buildings are employed for the double purposes of calcining ca∣lamine for the brass-works at <HI>Cheadle</HI> and <HI>Macclesfield,</HI> and for
<PB N="274" REF="291"/>
the smelting lead-ore. It has the advantage of a small stream, which improves the operation of the latter.</P>
<P>IT turns two wheels, one of which is twenty-four feet in dia∣meter, and from the size and breadth makes a noble appearance. At each end of these wheels is a balance-wheel; one of them sets the great refining bellows in motion, the other that of the slag∣hearth.</P>
<P>HERE is also a curious contrivance for saving the calx of the lead-ore, which would otherwise have gone away in smoke. It besides lessens the bad effects on the grounds above. For this purpose two brick flues have been constructed, one from each furnace; each of them is horizontal, and is supported by three arches, and over each is a channel to contain a small current of water, for the purpose of turning the wheels, and also to con∣dense the smoke in its passage. These flues converge, and meet a little beyond the third arch, and terminate in the condensing room, to the walls of which the calx adheres. This room is opened three times a-year: the calx is taken out, and re-smelted with some profit.</P>
<P>THE two flues, in issuing out of the building, are united in one, and are continued, forming a right angle for a very considerable way. Out of the end rises a vertical flue, forty-three feet high, out of which the smoke issues. The length of the horizontal flues which pass over the arches is fifty-seven feet; of the single one which passes from the room which catches the calx, is two hundred and ten feet.</P>

I remem∣ber them standing; but soon after they became a heap of ruins, and at present their place is scarcely known.</P>

<P>THE collieries near these works have been very considerable.<NOTE PLACE="marg">COLLIERIES.</NOTE> I remember, about forty years ago, there was between twenty and thirty thousand tons of coal upon bank, the greatest quan∣tity, perhaps, ever seen together. The pits were then worked by the <HI>Gadlys</HI> company. The company had imprudently given
<PB N="276" REF="293"/>
their agent, one <HI>Lancester,</HI> an unlimited order for raising the coal. This he found so profitable to himself, that he never de∣sisted till the discovery was made of his selfish views. To ex∣pedite the working, he engaged numbers of colliers from <HI>New∣castle,</HI> and was the first in this country who made use of horses under ground. The coal might have lain on the bank to this day, if a dispute had not rose between the city of <HI>Dublin</HI> and the coal-adventurers at <HI>Whitehaven.</HI> This occasioned the citi∣zens of <HI>Dublin</HI> to purchase this great stock, which was all carried away before the differences were settled.</P>
<P>FOR a considerable time after this glut of coal, the collieries declined greatly, and became very low, till they were revived of late years by the spirit and perseverance of Mr. <HI>Roger Ellis,</HI> of <HI>Cornish,</HI> in the parish of <HI>Flint,</HI> who has erected a powerful fire-engine on the road-side, between <HI>Greenfield</HI> turnpike-gate and <HI>Flint,</HI> and raises great quantities of that important re∣quisite.</P>

<P><HI>Thomas,</HI> the disinherited son of this <HI>John,</HI> by his industry and skill in agriculture, became enabled to purchase this lordship, in 1617, of the first earl of <HI>Bridgewater,</HI> son of the lord chancellor <HI>Egerton.</HI> At the time when paper credit was little known, to him was intrusted cash to be conveyed to <HI>London,</HI> which, by a letter of <HI>Pyers Pennant</HI>'s, I find he did in person. The manor has continued in the family from his time. In 1753, the present gentleman improved it greatly, by an embankment from the <HI>sea,</HI> which in parts is productive of most excellent wheat, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>THE first I find of the line of the <HI>Pantons,</HI> is <HI>Jevan Panton,</HI> twelfth in descent from <HI>March-weithian,</HI> one of the fifteen tribes of <HI>North Wales.</HI> His wife was daughter and heir of <HI>Bennet,</HI> fourteenth in descent from <HI>Marchudd,</HI> another of the fifteen tribes. Their history, and their several descendants, are given in the Appendix to this Work.</P>
<P>ALL the coast of <HI>Whiteford</HI> and <HI>Holywell</HI> parishes are more particularly subject than the drier parts to pleurisies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">DISEASES.</NOTE> intermittents, and fevers of the putrid kinds. The last chiefly in the places where the poorer people are obliged to crowd into small apart∣ments,
<PB N="279" REF="296"/>
by which the air soon becomes soul, and produces this species of fever.</P>
<P>A CRUEL kind of quinzy has of late years infested these pa∣rishes, and others adjacent. In 1794 it raged particularly in the township of <HI>Greenfield,</HI> and parish of <HI>Halkin,</HI> and made dreadful havock among children from the age of three to that of five. The average loss was four or five in seven. In this visitation the disease did not attack adults; not that instances are wanting in other places of its attacking grown-up persons. In <HI>September,</HI> 1771, a Mr. <HI>Poole,</HI> his wife and mother, were buried in one vault in <HI>Bunhill-fields.</HI> His daughter fell a victim also, and made the sum of the family, who died at the same time, and by the same malignant disorder.</P>
<P>THE name given by the learned to this fatal disease, is <HI>angina maligna,</HI> and <HI>cynanche maligna. Cynanche,</HI> because the patients are often observed to protrude their tongue far out of their mouth, like an over-heated dog.</P>
<P>THE symptoms are too terrible for description. They may uselessly affect parents, who may safely trust to the medical peo∣ple for the knowlege of them, for they are by no means equivo∣cal; but, if any one's curiosity is excited, it may be satisfied by the perusal of the works of the late Dr. <HI>Fothergill,</HI> p. 198. and Dr. <HI>Huxham</HI>'s Essays, p. 286. It seems to have been one of the <HI>Nova Cohors Febrium.</HI> It was first observed in <HI>Spain,</HI> in 1610, from whence it spread into <HI>Malta, Sicily, Otr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nto, Apulia, Calabria,</HI> and, finally, in 1618, it broke out at <HI>Naples.</HI> It also appeared in the <HI>Archipelago,</HI> when <HI>Tournefort</HI> (see his <HI>Travels,</HI> i.
<PB N="280" REF="297"/>
p. 132.) was in <HI>Milo,</HI> in the year 17<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>0. In <HI>Spain</HI> it got the name of <HI>garrotillo,</HI> from the horrible noise made by the patients, like that of persons strangled by a rope.</P>
<P>THIS fatal disorder reached <HI>England</HI> in 1739. Its first victims were two sons of Mr. <HI>Pelham,</HI> on the 27th of <HI>November</HI> of that year. After this it seemed to disappear, but began again in 1742; and with great fatality in 1746, when several of the in∣habitants of <HI>Brom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y,</HI> near <HI>Bow,</HI> lost most of their children. From Dr. <HI>Huxham</HI> we learn, that in 1751 it visited <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wall;</HI> and from the latter part of that year, to <HI>May</HI> 1753, carried off numbers of children, and some adults.</P>
<P>IN the year 1743 it appeared in <HI>North Wales.</HI> From <HI>March</HI> 5th to <HI>March</HI> 10th, our late worthy vicar, the Reverend <HI>Griffith Griffith,</HI> buried three children. It was too much for his paternal feelings, and ever after greatly hurt his mind. And in the year 1744/5 that calamity visited the county of <HI>Caernarvon;</HI> and from <HI>January</HI> 28th to <HI>February</HI> 9th, the late Sir <HI>Thomas Mostyn,</HI> ba∣ronet, at <HI>Gloddaeth,</HI> in <HI>Caernarvonshire,</HI> lost four. These were observed to have been the only instances of the disease in their respective neighborhoods.</P>
<P>I CANNOT trace the progress of this disease any farther north∣ward than my own country. If it has not made any advances towards the colder climates, it may be deemed a malady of the warm and temperate parts of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>THAT it has found its way to the New World, appears from the following instances. In 1746 it visited many parts of <HI>North America,</HI> from <HI>Philadelphia</HI> to <HI>New-York</HI> and <HI>New-England,</HI> and
<PB N="281" REF="298"/>
with a rage unknown in <HI>Great-Britain;</HI> for in <HI>New-England</HI> it depopulated whole villages. And that it either continues on the continent, or has re-visited it, is evident from its having appeared in <HI>New York,</HI> in the year 1771.</P>
<P>THE <HI>cynanche trachialis,</HI> or <HI>croup,</HI> has appeared here too fre∣quently. A few years ago it destroyed not fewer than six chil∣dren in the family of a respectable farmer in a neighboring parish.</P>
<P>THE smelting-works at <HI>Flint</HI> are at a very small distance from the eastern boundary of <HI>Holywell.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">FLINT SMELLING-WORKS.</NOTE> The division of the parish of <HI>Flint</HI> from that of the latter, is by a rill not far from the town of <HI>Flint.</HI> The works are of great antiquity. They are here men∣tioned as the last link of the chain of metallic operations along the shore. There is no limiting the antiquity of the smelting-works; for we have proofs of very considerable ones having been near the town of <HI>Flint,</HI> at a place called <HI>Croes Ati,</HI> which is evident from the quantity of scoria of lead, bits of lead-ore, and frag∣ments of melted lead, discovered in several places. I refer the reader, for a full account of them, and of the various antiquities met with on the spot, to p. 52. vol. i. of my <HI>Welsh Tour,</HI> which evince that they had been <HI>Roman</HI> works; so that it is probable there had been a succession of smelting-hearths in one part or other of this county, even to the present day.</P>
<P>TO return to the works in question. They are frequently known by the name of the <HI>salt-works;</HI> which possibly implies that the site had been occupied by works of that nature, prior to the existence of the smelting-works. They have been occu∣pied
<PB N="282" REF="299"/>
by several companies: at present by Mr. <HI>Richard Ingleby,</HI> of <HI>Halkin.</HI>—May success be his reward, for the seasonable and useful importation of barley in the late time of scarcity; a cri∣tical relief to the numerous miners on the adjacent mountains, in which he had no more interest than in the rest of the human race!</P>

Such are the <HI>Middle∣tons,</HI> of <HI>Chirk</HI> castle and <HI>Gwaunynog;</HI> the <HI>Vaughans,</HI> of <HI>Glan-y-llyn,</HI> afterwards of <HI>Llwydiarth</HI> and <HI>Llangedwyn,</HI> but now extinct, who are descended from <HI>Ririd Flaidd,</HI> lord of <HI>Penllyn,</HI> &amp;c.

<HEAD>CORRECTIONS, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> TITLE PAGE to <HI>Whiteford,</HI> the date 1796.—I request that this may be read 1795. It was expected that the whole book would have been printed in that year; but by various delays, too well known to authors, it was not completed till the month of <HI>March</HI> 1796. I therefore beg the reader would consi∣der that the several references which may be supposed to relate to 1796 can only intend 1795: for example, p. 161. l. 9. 'next season' means the wheat-sowing season of that year. 'In the next year,' means 1796. The attentive reader will discover many other reference of that kind.</P>
<P>PAGE 99, after paragraph 2d.—We retain in <HI>Whiteford</HI> church the decent service of praying for the sick, instead of lazily sinking it into the xxixth supplicatlon of the <HI>Litany.</HI> The prayers on that occasion are so pathetic, so admonitory to the congregation, that I am amazed that any minister should remain insensible of the impropriety of the omission.</P>
<P>I NOW cannot but most earnestly exhort the squires of every parish to attendance on divine service, if it was only to hear the sad catalogue of the miserable objects which compose the largest part of those for whom the devotions I allude to are intended. It will direct their benevolence to their relief. They may find among them objects of their charity, whom they may never otherwise have heard of. They may find tenants to whom they ought to be fathers. They certainly will find congenerous beings, to whom every duty of humanity is enjoined by the SA∣VIOUR of the world: This I should hope is thus irresistibly enforced:</P>
<Q><PB N="324" REF="343"/><P>COME, YE BLESSED OF MY FATHER, INHERIT THE KINGDOM PREPARED FOR YOU FROM THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD.</P>
<P>FOR I WAS AN HUNGRED, AND YE GAVE ME MEAT; I WAS THIRSTY, AND YE GAVE ME DRINK; I WAS A STRANGER, AND YE TOOK ME IN; NAKED, AND YE CLOATHED ME; I WAS SICK, AND YE VISITED ME; I WAS IN PRISON, AND YE CAME UNTO ME.</P>
<P>THEN SHALL THE RIGHTEOUS ANSWER HIM, SAYING, LORD, WHEN SAW WE THEE AN HUNGRED, AND FED THEE? OR THIRSTY, AND GAVE THEE DRINK?</P>
<P>WHEN SAW WE THEE A STRANGER, AND TOOK THEE IN? OR NAKED, AND CLOTHED THEE?</P>
<P>OR WHEN SAW WE THEE SICK, OR IN PRISON, AND CAME UNTO THEE?</P>
<P>AND THE KING SHALL ANSWER, AND SAY UNTO THEM, VERILY I SAY UNTO YOU, INASMUCH AS YE HAVE DONE IT UNTO ONE OF THE LEAST OF THESE MY BRETHREN, YE HAVE DONE IT UNTO ME.</P></Q>
<P>To these benedictory verses let me add one, in which the penalty, as well as the reward is united. I cannot resist the im∣pulse, as it is so admirably adapted to the times. It shall be followed by an extract from p. 164 of this work, which I com∣municated to the public through the channel of the <HI>Chester</HI> paper, followed by some declarations to prevent the mistaking of any part. I fervently wish to promote a friendly agreement between landlord and tenant; between tenant and every poor laborer. The benevolent Duke of BEAUFORT, and I believe others of the benevolent GREAT, have made the attempt; and, to
<PB N="325" REF="344"/>
the glory of landlord and tenant, are to this moment dispensing their generous plan to a grateful people. Such an agreement was entered into by the farmers of part of this and a neighbor∣ing county; but to their infamy, many of them withdrew from their words and their signatures. May the landlords become the instruments of compelling them to accept the blessing offered in the last part of the line, and to shun the curse denounced in the first! There is one description of men, on whom it should fall in a most exemplary manner. The badger, or factor, employed to exhaust the stock of corn and other provisions, not by fair agreement, but by openly raising the price, by offering more than the farmer would have asked; and even telling them, in open market, 'Ask what you will, and we will give it.' The poor, since the repeal of the 5th and 6th of <HI>Edward</HI> IV. by the 12th of <HI>George</HI> III. are left defenceless. The means of inflicting the pu∣nishment by the statute is taken away, and they are to seek justice through the tedious expensive labyrinths of the common law.</P>
<Q>HE THAT WITHHOLDETH CORN, THE PEOPLE SHALL CURSE HIM: BUT BLESSING SHALL BE UPON THE HEAD OF HIM THAT SELLETH IT.

<LETTER>
<HEAD>To the <HI>EDITOR</HI> of the <HI>CHESTER COURANT.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>PERMIT me to convey, through the channel of your paper, a paragraph from a book which is still in the press:</P>
<P><Q>I would never grant a lease to a great corn-tenant. I would preserve a power over his granary, which legislature will not, or
<PB N="326" REF="345"/>
cannot assume. Should he attempt by exportation to exhaust it in years of scarcity, and not leave a sufficient supply for the country which produced the grain; — should he attempt a mo∣nopoly,—should he refuse to carry a proper quantity to the next market;—or should he refuse to sell, to the poor who can∣not attend the market, corn in small quantities, I WOULD INSTANTLY ASSUME THE POWER OF THE LANDLORD, AND EXPEL HIM FROM MY ESTATE. A just punishment for the tenant, who, through rapacity, declines to comply with my desires, excited with no other view than to promote the good of the public.</Q></P>
<P>THE end which we wish by the above radically to correct, may soon be past cure, I therefore commit the extract to your hands. The evil is entirely local; other parts of <HI>Great Britain</HI> are possibly unaffected by it, and have no occasion to take alarm. We do not wish the farmers solely to feed the poor; we only re∣quest them to reserve in the country corn enough of EVERY kind to enable others to exert their benevolence to their poorer neigh∣bors; not by gratu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tous donations, but by selling it at reasonable prices to those who are in want; we do not ask it from the farmers at the prices of good times. GOD forbid that we should deny them FAIR profits, such as every other dealer has a right to. I wish to inculcate universal justice; but let us remember that CHARITY begins at home. We shall gladly impart our super∣fluity to our most distant neighbors, even should we be obliged to pay more for the bare competency we may reserve.</P>
