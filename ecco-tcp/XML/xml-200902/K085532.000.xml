<P>THE ground work of the following Epistles being the fruit of a private correspondence, it was found necessary, in preparing them for the press; to adapt them to more general use and a∣musement. It may not, therefore, be improper to observe that, whatever theological subjects have fallen in the author's way, he hath purposely avoid∣ed taking part with divines of any sect or party: leaving it to the ingenuous, of every persuasion, to determine how far their particular sentiments may be supported by authorities, superior to com∣mon-sense and simple demonstration. — As to his poetry; having no reputation to lose, he is little anxious about what he may acquire. Indeed, it must be confess'd that perspicuity and argument have been frequently consulted, at the expence both of the dignity and harmony of his numbers, Elegance, however, would have been more at∣tended
<PB N="xxii" REF="20"/>
to, had the author's leisure permitted; or, had his design been to distinguish himself as a <HI>poet;</HI> a character he is much less ambitious of than that of a <HI>philosopher.</HI> —
<Q><L>Unmov'd by sophistry, unaw'd by name,</L>

<HEAD>SUMMARY.</HEAD>
<P>UNiversal belief being, in fact, an undisputed criterion of truth, and all mankind necessarily believing those posi∣tions which they conceive demonstrable; science, or demonstra∣tive knowledge, is supposed to be the least exceptionable test of what is true or false, in general. —The abstract certitude of the schools is, therefore, exploded. But, as particular opinions are not always the effect of knowledge, nor are systems con∣stantly founded on scientifick principles, it is inquired if there be no other criterion, sufficiently obvious to relieve the doubts and reconcile the opposite sentiments of mankind. —The dispen∣sations of providence, as well as the dictates of revelation, ap∣pear inadequate to the purpose; theologists being found too un∣succeessful, in clearing up the sacred page, and phisiologists too ignorant of the system of nature, for either to form opinions, equally adapted to the credulity of individuals. —Divines and philosophers are censured, indeed, rather as, mercenary wrang∣lers, or bigots to particular systems, than fair inquirers after, or teachers of, the truth. —A fair and ingenuous inquirer characteriz'd. —Such not frequently to be found; few being capacitated for so arduous a task. —Fortitude and moderation the grand requisites: the scarcity of which in the minds of men, in general, serves to account for their want of success in the attempt; as well as for their promptitude either to embrace
<PB N="4" REF="26"/>
skepticism, as an antidote to errour, or conformity, to avoid the trouble of thinking. —Dogmatists and Skepticks censured: The former on account of their absurd dependance on tradition and futile authorities: the latter for superciliously rejecting, on the other hand, all authority and tradition, without dis∣tinction. —In our inquiries after truth, however, our belief is to be suspended in regard to points beyond our knowledge. —In scientifick researches, also, the subtilty of metaphysical argu∣ments should be with caution trusted, as insensibly leading us into errour and perplexity.</P>

<HEAD>ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<P>On Science, as our guide to truth—The criterion best adapted to the opinion of individuals— The absurdity of persecution—Our preten∣sions to divine, and the bounds of human knowledge.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="summary">

<HEAD>SUMMARY</HEAD>
<P>SCience, though admitted as the rule of faith in matters re∣lating to the investigation of truth, is neither exclusive nor universal, affecting only our opinion in speculative points. For, however refin'd are our <HI>credenda,</HI> we insensibly join, in our practical notions, with the rest of mankind. —Whatever objection, therefore, scientifick inquirers may make to the systems of others, none can be made to their fixing the criterion of truth on knowledge: the certainty of which is, by implication, ad∣mitted in the general pretensions of mankind to <HI>common-sense.</HI> —This is the privilege of ev'ry mind, without distinction; e∣nabling us equally to draw like conclusions from like premises. —All actual dispute, therefore, arises from some misunder∣standing, or different acceptation, of the matter in question: as the most ignorant peasant is equally certain of the proofs he comprehends with the greatest philosopher. —For the same rea∣son, nevertheless, those would be engag'd in a desperate under∣taking, who should attempt to reconcile mankind to any one system of opinion; the capacity and credulity of individuals being so very different, in consequence of their diversity of temperament, education and experience. —It is injurious and ridiculous, therefore, to insult others, for thinking in the manner we ourselves should have done, under the same circum∣stances. —It is still more absurd to reprobate the rest of man∣kind for not believing what we ourselves do not, nor can pos∣sibly
<PB N="46" REF="68"/>
be made to, believe: as is the case when we would im∣pose tenets, that either contradict themselves, or are, in fact, downright nonsense—For it is impossible to believe apparent falshood, or to be convinc'd of any thing, by a set of words, that convey no determinate meaning—Mysterious or unin∣telligible propositions cannot, therefore, be believ'd—If the truth of revelation, in general, be admitted, as what is re∣veal'd from Heaven must undoubtedly be true, the difficulty of knowing what is particularly so, or who are the truly in∣spir'd, is yet inexplicably great. —Tho' the power of working miracles also be allow'd a proof of inspiration, in the agent; the fallacy of pretended ones, and the suppos'd inspiration of im∣postors, are almost invincible obstacles to our discovery of the truth. —The supposition, also, that real miracles are trans∣gressions of the laws of nature is not at all necessary to sup∣port their veracity; but argues the contrary; and implies an in∣jurious reflection on the omnipotence and prescience of the Deity. —Whatever reasonable objections, however, we may have a∣gainst putting implicit faith in either pretended miracles or re∣velation; yet as the utmost extent of scientifick discovery falls so infinitely short of a perfect knowledge of the designs and opera∣tions of Nature; we cannot philosophically deny that God sometimes produces effects, for ends best known to himself, by means wholly unknown to us. —To proceed, nevertheless, in our inquiries on the most certain grounds, the criterion of Science is to be neglected only in points indisputably and intelligibly re∣veal'd.</P>

<P>IT is remarkable that, notwithstanding the universality of those truths which are founded on <HI>common-sense,</HI> man∣kind have ever been so infatuated as to reject this general and obvious criterion, for the more particular dogmas and mys∣terious paradoxes of pretended revelation. —The moral effects of this infatuation exemplified in our superficial attachment to religion, our indolent security in time of prosperity, and our transitory astonishment and penitence under the immediate weight of misfortune. —An absurd scheme of education the grand cause of that cowardice and imbecility of mind, which render us so ridiculous in speculation and inconsistent in prac∣tice. —The misapplication of their talents, therefore, who think by encreasing such weakness to promote the cause of truth, or the interest of religion and morality, is plac'd in a ridiculous light; as the just object of censure. —The supposition, also, that ignorance and implicit subjection to authority are necessa∣ry to the well-being of society, or the political happiness of mankind, is exploded; and shown to be exemplarily false and absurd: polity in general, as well as religion and private vir∣tue in particulars, being founded on truth and nature, and not dependant on the chimerical productions of fancy, the low ar∣tifices of faction, or the knavish cunning of designing false∣hood.</P>

<HEAD>ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<P>On the weakness of the human understanding. —The abstract existence of the Deity. —The incomprehensibility of the divine nature, and the incongruity of pretended atheism.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="summary">
<PB REF="149"/>
<HEAD>SUMMARY.</HEAD>
<P>AS it is necessary to our success in scientifick resear∣ches that the mind should be divested of its prejudices, in favour of tradition and custom; so, however extensive be the freedom of enquiry, it is equally necessary that the object of investigation be adapted to the limits of the under∣standing: mankind always falling into errour and confusion, in their attempts to discover the knowledge of things beyond their capacity. However true, therefore, may be many of our dis∣coveries in the system of Nature; <HI>God,</HI> the authour of that system, is abstracted from it and above our comprehension. — Hence our pretensions to describe, or define, the <HI>Deity,</HI> are palpably absurd and ridiculous. For, tho' a created Being may ascribe to its creator the most respectable of all known perfections, yet, as all its ideas of perfection are relative to itself, the attributes human beings ascribe to God are necessa∣rily the superior qualities of <HI>humanity.</HI> —Notwithstanding, however, the Deity is so far removed from our enquiries, and thereby confessedly no object of philosophical knowledge, yet the actual disbelief of the existence of a God is denied: the argu∣ments for and against atheists composing, in fact, a very ridiculous dispute: as the impossibility of denying the being of a <HI>first cause</HI> is evident; and the rest of the controversy a mere cavil about words, of no determinate meaning.</P>

<HEAD>ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<P>On happiness. —The apparent incapacity of mankind for its enjoyment. —The compara∣tive pain and pleasure of human sensations; and their relation to our physical and moral constitution.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="summary">
<PB REF="176"/>
<HEAD>SUMMARY.</HEAD>
<P>NEXT to the absurdity of puzzling ourselves in the in∣vestigation of matters beyond our capacity, and equally an obstacle to our inquiries after truth, is the folly of our con∣stant pursuit, and in spite of as constant disappointments, our expectations of <HI>happiness</HI>—The term is certainly left vague and ill-defin'd even by those philosophers who, pretending it to be attainable, affect to teach us how happiness may be acquir'd—Its meaning is, nevertheless, obvious; and is determined from the tenour of its acceptation with the generality of man∣kind. In which sense, it is shown to be hitherto unattain'd; and that, not only from the impossibility of <HI>externals</HI> to confer happiness, but, from the evident incapacity of human beings to be made happy—It is hence, also, declar'd unattainable; and even the most laudable means whereby it is pursued, as those of knowledge, religion, and virtue are experimentally, and logically, shown to be incapable of conferring happiness. —In fact, ev'ry state, age and condition of life having its seve∣ral distinct anxieties and consolations, it appears that a conti∣nued sense of either happiness or misery is incompatible with our nature; as well as with the very essence of pleasure and pain in general: our sensations of both which are merely compara∣tive and reciprocally necessary to that of each other. Whence happiness and misery are evidently relative to, and dependant on, the constitution of the human frame; with which abstract pain and pleasure are totally inconsistent.</P>

<HEAD>ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<P>On abstract good and evil—The physical per∣fection of the material universe, and the mo∣ral harmony observable in the dispensations of Providience.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="summary">
<PB REF="223"/>
<HEAD>SUMMARY</HEAD>
<P>THE inquiries, of philosophers into the abstract cause of e∣vil have hitherto been attended with little success. In∣deed, no such abstract evil exists. For, whatever calamities human life be subject to, their <HI>evil</HI> depends merely on our own s;ensibility. Even physical evils, which are the least contro∣vertible, are evidently relative to their effects on the suffer∣ings, or enjoyments, of mankind. Whence they must not be accounted abstract evils, or real defects in the general system of things: of which we have at present but a <HI>partial</HI> view; and therefore cannot tell how far apparent imperfections may conduce to the perfection of the <HI>whole.</HI> That human life is subject, nevertheless, to palpable evils cannot be denied: but it should be consider'd that, as such evils are but temporary, and are evil but in proportion to the pleasure, or good, by which they are contrasted, we are not sensible of any abstracted evil, unless a state of humanity, on the whole, be attended with a greater portion, of pain than pleasure. This is asserted by many; but is experimentally false. Indeed, on a fair and im∣partial estimate, our sufferings and enjoyments seem to stand on an equal ballance. Hence, also, if there be no abstract phy∣sical evil in the universe, there is as little reason for us to hold
<PB N="206" REF="224"/>
the existence of physical good; or to maintain that happiness is the privilege of human life. That "whatever <HI>is</HI> is <HI>right,</HI>" with respect to the whole, is allow'd; but that it is therefore <HI>good</HI> is another consideration: <HI>goodness</HI> being a term relative to the happiness of mankind, and not applicable to that general system. The famous principle of <HI>the BEST</HI> is therefore futile and frivolous—As to <HI>moral</HI> good and evil: we owe a sense of them purely to <HI>physical:</HI> for had mankind felt neither pain nor pleasure, they would never, from the light of nature, have ac∣quir'd the ideas of moral good or ill. Those actions, therefore, are morally good which give rise to more pleasure than pain; and morally bad, <HI>vice versa:</HI> Innocence being, strictly speaking, neither good nor evil; and indeed inconsistent with a state of <HI>action.</HI> Moral evil appears, hence, to be, also, merely rela∣tive to <HI>man;</HI> and can by no means be consider'd as a defect in the designs of Providence; unless we can be so absurd as to sup∣pose it in the power of created beings to counterwork the in∣tentions of their supreme creator. On the other hand, moral good is equally relative, and can have no effect on the happi∣ness of the first cause, or plead any abstract merit with the Deity. Moral good and evil, however, in the agent, is ne∣cessarily attended with temporary happiness and misery; in the
<PB N="207" REF="225"/>
distribution of which, also, agreeable to relative merit, it is not improbable that impartial justice is done, even in this life, in the perfect dispensations of Providence. Our hopes or ap∣prehensions, nevertheless, of a future state are not hereby cut off. On the contrary, this life may only be preparatory to a future; where the virtuous and vicious may be very diffe∣rently dispos'd of in the scale of existence. But, whatever be our lot hereafter, it rests on the good pleasure of our creator: into whose hands philosophy calmly resigns the hidden concerns of futurity.</P>

<L>The first sole agent Was the <HI>will:</HI></L>

<L>As from experience naught it knew,</L>
<L>Of good or bad, or false or true:<MILESTONE N="480"/></L>

<L>Suppose our first sensation pain;</L>
<L>Let pain or pleasure be attain'd,</L>
<L>Of both an equal sense was gain'd,<MILESTONE N="500"/></L>
<L>As the first tree of knowledge bore</L>

<L>For when the mind one pleasure knew,</L>

<HEAD>SUMMARY.</HEAD>
<P>THE doctrine, by which virtue and vice are confessedly limited to this life, will doubtless excite the clamour of those who pride themselves, or ground their expectations of fu∣ture happiness, on their own merit. It may also be ask'd, "To what purpose is it that mankind should pursue virtue rather than vice, if all our pains and pleasures depend recipro∣cally on each other, and our bad deeds neither actually offend, nor our good ones have any real merit with, the Deity." It is answer'd, that, as the merits and demerits of virtue and vice are partial and relative, so also must be conceiv'd their respec∣tive rewards and punishments. So that, whatever distinction may be made between the virtuous and vicious in a future state, it must be purely owing to the good pleasure of our crea∣tor, and not to the influence of our merit over his final deter∣minations. —It must not be conceiv'd, however, that this doctrine countenances immorality. On the contrary, it proves, that (as we are led to vice solely by the motives of pleasure, apparently attending the gratification of our desires) were a conviction always present to the mind, that such pleasure must necessarily be attended with an equal degree of pain, such con∣viction might prove an antidote to vice, and preserve us, at least, in innocence; the motive to action being thereby remov'd. As to actual virtue, indecd, it is not pretended that any ra∣tional
<PB N="260" REF="277"/>
conviction whatever is, of itse'f, a sufficient motive to virtue: the use of reason being only to determine what is true or false, just or unjust; and not to excite us to embrace either. This is the business of the <HI>passions;</HI> which are, however, in themselves, neither good nor evil: those dispositions of mind which are generally term'd virtuous being the frequent occa∣sion of our falling into vices, which opposite ones, tho' general∣ly disapprov'd or detested, would have secur'd us from. Thus compassion, benevolence and candour are the fertile sources of vice; while hardness-of-heart, selfishness, and distrust are as frequently the means of preserving innocence. Nay the fierce, harden'd and turbulent passions enter sometimes into the most virtuous characters; and a heart unaffccted by the present suff'rings of humanity is, not unfrequently, necessary to pre∣serve the rights and liberties of mankind. —In fact we are much deceiv'd, in the motives as well as in the practice of virtue; it being not only necessary that we should mean to do good and take the best way our reason may direct us to effect it; but that we should previously take those measures which are in our power, to acquire the knowledge of the means of doing such good. Wilful ignorance is declar'd therefore intentionally vi∣cious; not having, tho' innocent in fact, the least claim to merit; to which ev'n virtue itself hath but relative pretensions. Indeed, as physical good in the consequence is the measure of moral good in the <HI>action,</HI> the very appearance of <HI>merit</HI> in the <HI>agent</HI> in a great degree vanistes; our power of doing good de∣pending
<PB N="261" REF="278"/>
frequently on accident, and, not very seldom on downright knavery. On all which considerations knowledge is laid dow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> as a fundamental and indispensible moral principle; and, hence, the employment of our leisure hours in inquiries after tru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> is presum'd to be not merely entertaining but morally virtuous.</P>

<P>On the immortality of the soul; and the argu∣ments for, and against, a future state.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="summary">
<PB N="301" REF="317"/>
<HEAD>SUMMARY.</HEAD>
<P>THE immortality of the soul, or doctrine of a future state, is propos'd as the subject of inquiry. A doctrine, which, however true or false in itself, is both weakly attack'd and lamely supported by the philosophical arguments generally made use of, for, or against, it. Comparisons drawn from the <HI>vegetable</HI> creation, however striking, are partial and prove nothing. <HI>Moral</HI> arguments prove as little, unless we could first be made certain that vice and virtue are not duly punish'd and rewarded in this life; or, unless we could entertain ade∣quate ideas of divine justice. With these, the metaphysical re∣finements, concerning the soul's <HI>immateriality,</HI> are shown to be equally inconclusive. Our natural <HI>desire of existence</HI> is expos'd, also, as a weak argument for the justice of our claim to immortality. On the other hand, that <HI>intimate connection</HI> between body and mind, and their apparent dependance on each other, are shown to afford rather a specious plea in favour of the immortality of the soul, than, as frequently made to do, any argument against it—Setting, however, moral and me∣taphysical speculations aside, man is consider'd merely in the light of an <HI>animal.</HI> In which state of humiliation, his pre∣tensions to a future state are, notwithstanding, evidently justi∣fied on the plain and reasonable supposition that, the Creator hath given to all animals such pow'rs and faculties as were necessary to the state of <HI>being</HI> appointed them.—Now the evi∣dent pursuits of other animals tend solely to the gratification' of
<PB N="302" REF="318"/>
themselves or the mere preservation of their kind. They have no intellectual system that extends beyond the life of the indivi∣dual; nor doth their experience serve to the improvement of their species. With man it is otherwise: The preservation and gratification of the individual, however powerful their motives, are in him made subservient to more general views: his case, health and life being constantly sacrific'd to pursuits, that are of no use to him merely as an animal; but, on the contrary, serve to promote the intellectual perfection of his species; hence apparently intended for the enjoyment of a state of existence, to which those faculties are adapted. In the powers of imagination and genius may also be trac'd that faint image of the Deity, in which man was confessedly made. So that philosophy alone affords us sufficient reason to believe the certainty of a future state, without our having recourse to con∣tested authorities, the chimerical suppositions of <HI>errour,</HI> or the absurdities of <HI>ignorance.</HI></P>

<L>Own'd the <HI>divinity</HI> of MAN.<MILESTONE N="500"/></L>
<L>A truth that genius feels and knows,</L>
<L>As oft as with the God it glows.</L>
<L><PB N="335" REF="351"/>And shall t'oblivion be consign'd</L>
<L>This portion of etherial mind?</L>
<L>O, no.—Come death in any form,<MILESTONE N="505"/></L>
<L>I doubt not to ride out the storm;</L>
<L>The shipwreck'd body to survive;</L>
<L>My thinking part still left alive.</L>
<L>Mean-while, through all the modes of sense,</L>
<L>Bear me, bold <HI>Contemplation,</HI> hence.<MILESTONE N="510"/></L>
<L>On thy firm wing, O, let me soar;</L>
<L>And idly hope and fear no more.</L>
<L>Bear me to th' ever-blooming groves,</L>
<L>Where genius with fair science roves;</L>
<L>Where, in the cool sequester'd shade,<MILESTONE N="515"/></L>
<L>Sits <HI>Resignation,</HI> pious maid;</L>
<L>To Heav'n directed by whose eye,</L>
<L>When drooping nature calls to die,</L>
<L>Let <HI>this</HI> my latest <HI>wishes</HI> crown,</L>
<L><PB N="336" REF="352"/>On her soft lap to lay me down; <MILESTONE N="520"/></L>
<L>Whilst mild <HI>content,</HI> and gentle <HI>peace,</HI></L>
<L>Her handmaids, waiting my release,</L>
<L>Strow, stealing round with softest tread,</L>
<L>Their grateful roses o'er my bed,</L>
<L>No thorn among, to break my rest; <MILESTONE N="525"/></L>
<L>By euthanasian slumbers blest;</L>
<L>Without a sigh, at close of day,</L>
<L>To breathe, becalm'd, my soul away.</L>
