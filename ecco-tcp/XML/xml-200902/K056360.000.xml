<P>THE Earl of Warwick, A TRAGEDY, As it is perform'd at the THEATRE ROYAL IN DRURY-LANE.</P>
<P>LONDON: Printed for T. DAVIES, Russel-Street, Covent-Garden; R. BALDWIN, Pater-Noster-Row; and W. GRIFFIN, Catharine-Street, in the Strand. M.DCC.LXVI. [Price ONE SHILLING and SIXPENCE.]</P>

<HEAD>Advertisement. To the PUBLIC,</HEAD>
<P>THE author takes this opportunity to acknowledge his obli∣gation to the public, for their favourable reception of THE EARL OF WARWICK. He flatters himself, that the li∣cense so necessary to his plan, which he has taken in common with other writers, in deviating from historical truth, espe∣cially in a period so distant and obscure, will meet with in∣dulgence.</P>
<P>For the many faults <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of this piece, he can only plead that title to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> is generally extended in favour of a first essay, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> that the same candour which approv'd on the stage, will accompany it to the closet.</P>
<P>He cannot, without the most manifest injustice, forbear to add, that the more than ordinary exertion of dramatic powers, display'd by the principal actors concerned in it, contributed in a great measure to the success of the performance.</P>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE,</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Written by GEORGE COLMAN, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Spoken by Mr. BENSLEY.</BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>SEVERE each poet's lot; but sure most hard</L>
<L>Is the condition of the playhouse bard:</L>
<L>Doom'd to hear all that wou'd-be critics talk,</L>
<L>And in the go-cart of dull rules to walk!</L>
<L>"Yet authors multiply," you say. 'Tis true.</L>
<L>But what a numerous crop of critics too!</L>
<L>Scholars alone of old durst judge and write;</L>
<L>But now each journalist turns Stagyrite.</L>
<L>Quintilians in each coffee-house you meet,</L>
<L>And many a Longinus walks the street.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In Shakespear's days, when his advent'rous muse,</L>
<L>A muse of fire! durst each bold licence use,</L>
<L>Her noble ardour met no critic's phlegm,</L>
<L>To check wild fancy, or her flights condemn:</L>
<L>Ariels and Calibans unblam'd she drew,</L>
<L>Or goblins, ghosts, and witches, brought to view.</L>
<L>If to historic truth she shap'd her verse,</L>
<L>A nation's annals freely she'd rehearse;</L>
<L>Bring Rome's or England's story on the stage,</L>
<L>And run, in three short hours, thro' half an age.</L>
<L>Our bard, all terror-struck, and fill'd with dread,</L>
<L>In Shakespear's awful footsteps dares not tread;</L>
<L>Thro' the wide field of hist'ry fears to stray,</L>
<L>And builds upon one narrow spot his play;</L>
<L>Steps not from realm to realm, whole feas between,</L>
<L>But barely changes twice or thrice his scene:</L>
<L>While Shakespear vaults on the poetic wire,</L>
<L>And pleas'd spectators fearfully admire,</L>
<L>Our bard, a critic pole between his hands,</L>
<L>On the tight-rope, scarce balanc'd, trembling stands;</L>
<L>Slowly and cautiously his way he makes,</L>
<L>And fears to fall at ev'ry step he takes:</L>
<L>While then fierce Warwick he before you brings,</L>
<L>That setter-up and puller-down of kings,</L>
<L>With British candour dissipate his sear!</L>
<L>An English story fits an English ear.</L>
<L>Tho' harsh and crude you deem his first essay,</L>
<L>A second may your favours well repay;</L>
<L>Applause may nerve his verse, and chear his heart,</L>
<L>And teach the practice of this dangerous art.</L>

<L>Yes,—by my contrivance,</L>
<L>When last he hunted in the forest, some,</L>
<L>Whom I had planted there, as if by chance</L>
<L>Alone directed, led him cross the lawn</L>

<SPEAKER>CLIFFORD.</SPEAKER>
<L>What follow'd?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARGARET.</SPEAKER>
<L>O!</L>
<L>He gaz'd and wonder'd; for a while his pride</L>
<L>Indignant rose, and struggled with his passion,</L>
<L>But love was soon victorious: and last night,</L>
<L>The earl of Suffolk, so my trusty spies</L>
<L>Inform me, was dispatch'd on wings of love,</L>
<L>To plead his master's cause, and offer her</L>
<L>The throne of England.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CLIFFORD.</SPEAKER>
<L>What if she refuse</L>
<L>The golden bribe?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARGARET.</SPEAKER>
<L>No matter; all I wish</L>
<L>Is but to make them foes: the gen'rous Warwick</L>
<L>Is fiery, and impatient of reproof,</L>
<L>He will not brook a rival in his love</L>
<L>Though seated on a throne; besides, thou know'st,</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="9"/>
The haughty earl looks down with scorn on Edward,</L>
<L>As the mere work of his all-pow'rful hand,</L>
<L>The baby monarch of his own creation.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CLIFFORD.</SPEAKER>
<L>Believe me, madam, Edward still reveres</L>
<L>And loves him, still as conscious of the debt,</L>
<L>Pays him with trust and confidence; their souls</L>
<L>Are link'd together in the strictest bonds</L>
<L>Of sacred friendship.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARGARET.</SPEAKER>
<L>That but serves my cause:</L>
<L>Where ties are close, and interests united,</L>
<L>The slightest inj'ries are severely felt;</L>
<L>Offended friendship never can forgive.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CLIFFORD.</SPEAKER>
<L>Now the full prospect opens to my view,</L>
<L>I see thy distant aim, and trace the paths</L>
<L>Of vengeance: England soon will be a scene</L>
<L>Of blood and horror, discord's fatal torch</L>
<L>Once lit up it in this devoted land,</L>
<L>What pow'r shall e'er extinguish it? alas!</L>
<L>I tremble at the consequence.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARGARET.</SPEAKER>
<L>And I</L>

<L>Of pride 'gainst pride, oppression 'gainst oppression;</L>
<L>Rise but the storm, and let the waves beat high,</L>
<L>The wreck may be our own: in the warm struggle,</L>
<L>Who knows but one or both of them may fall,</L>
<L>And Marg'ret rise triumphant on their ruin!</L>
<L>It must be so; and see the king approaches:</L>
<L>This way he passes from the council—mark</L>

<L>Steal down its secret track, and from her breast</L>
<L>Heard a deep sigh, she struggled to conceal;</L>
<L>If I have any judgment, or can trace</L>

<L>Stood nobly firm, and seem'd to brave his fate,</L>
<L>When Warwick like a guardian god appear'd:</L>
<L>His noble mien and all-commanding look</L>
<L>Struck deep attention; ev'ry eye was bent</L>
<L>Upon him, and an awful silence reign'd</L>
<L>O'er either host, he rais'd his voice on high,</L>

<L>EXHAUSTED quite with prisons, racks, and death,</L>
<L>Permit me here to take a little breath!</L>
<L>You who have seen my actions, known their springs,</L>
<L>Say, are we women such <HI>insipid</HI> things?</L>

<L>I come to know to <HI>whom</HI> the palm is due,</L>
<L>To us weak vessels, or to stronger you?</L>
<L>Against your conqu'ring swords, I draw—my fan,</L>
<L>Come on!—now parry Marg'ret, if you can.</L>
<STAGE>(Sets herself in a posture of defence.</STAGE>
<L>Stand up, ye boasters! <STAGE>(to the pit)</STAGE> don't there sneaking sit;</L>
<L>Are you for <HI>Pleasure, Politics,</HI> or <HI>Wit?</HI></L>
<L>The boxes smile to see me scold the pit.</L>
<L><HI>Their</HI> turn is next—and tho' I will not wrong 'em,</L>
<L>A woeful havock there will be among 'em.—</L>
<L>You our best friends, <STAGE>(to the pit)</STAGE> love, cherish, and respect us;</L>
<L>Not take our fortunes, marry, and neglect us.</L>
<L>You think indeed, that as you please, you rule us,</L>

<L>What is your boast?—Wou'd you, like me, have done,</L>
<L>To free a captive wife, or fare a son?</L>
<L>Rather than run such dangers of your lives,</L>
<L>You'd leave your children, and lock up your wives.</L>
