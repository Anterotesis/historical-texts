<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>INquiries into antiquity are so little the taste of the present age, that a writer who employs his time in that way deceives himself if he expects to derive either much reputation or any advantage from his work. Pre∣judiced against the subject, we add contempt to its natural steri∣lity, and seem to wish for no in∣formation from a province which we have been taught to assign to fiction and romance. Under these impressions the Author of the Introduction wrote. With∣out any of the ordinary incite∣ments to literary labour, he was induced to proceed by the sole motive of private amusement.</P>
<P><PB REF="3"/>
Notwithstanding the small hopes he entertains of reconciling the public judgment to the pe∣riod which he has endeavoured to illustrate, he has taken some pains to present, in its most a∣greeable form, a subject not very capable of ornament. He has studied to be clear in disquisition, concise in observation, just in in∣ference. An enemy to fiction himself, he imposes none upon the world. He advances nothing as fact without authorities; and his conjectures arise not so much from his own ingenuity, as from the proofs which the ancients have laid down before him.</P>
<P>The darkness, with which the prejudice and vanity of the Scots and Irish have covered their ori∣gin, has forced the Author to examine that point with a mi∣nuteness, which a dispute so un∣important
<PB REF="4"/>
seems not to deserve. But the disquisitions of many learned men had given a kind of consequence to the subject, when they rendered it perplexed and obscure. To extricate truth from the polemical rubbish of former antiquaries was a task of labour; and the candid will forgive the length, on account of the pro∣priety, of the disquisition, espe∣cially in a work which pro∣fessedly treats of the antiquities of the British nations.</P>
<P>In that part of his work which relates to the disputes between the British and Irish Scots, the Author of the Introduction de∣rives much of his information from the manuscript notes of the late very ingenious Dr. Macpher∣son, whose dissertations on the antiquities of the northern Bri∣tain are in the hands of the learn∣ed. In the other provinces of
<PB REF="5"/>
his subject, he has availed him∣self of the industry of some mo∣dern writers; but he neither bor∣rows their sentiments, nor relies upon their judgment. He looks upon antiquity through the me∣dium of the ancients, and thinks he sees it in its genuine state. His work is formed on the gene∣ral result of the information which the writers of Greece and Rome have transmitted from every quar∣ter; and if his system is not satis∣factory, it, at least, is new.</P>

<HEAD>STATE AND REVOLUTIONS OF ANCIENT EUROPE.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="subsection">
<HEAD>Preliminary Reflections.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The north∣ern nations averse to letters.</NOTE> THE northern nations, whose cha∣racter was in many respects singu∣lar, were remarkable for their aversion to the study of letters. Fierce and untrac∣table by nature, and bred from their in∣fancy to incursion and depredation, they
<PB N="2" REF="12"/>
thought every pursuit not immediately subservient to the profession of arms mean and dishonourable. They little considered that this prejudice was a fatal enemy to the fame which they sought after with so much eagerness in the field. In vain were exploits worthy of memory performed, when the only certain means of transmit∣ting them to posterity were discouraged and despised.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The middle ages</NOTE> In the cloud of ignorance which invol∣ved them at home they advanced into the provinces of western empire. Learning, which had long languished among the Romans, expired with the power of that illustrious people; and Europe, in a great measure, returned to its original rudeness and barbarity. When the detached tribes who had subverted the government of the Romans formed themselves into regular communities some knowledge of letters began to revive; but the Christian cler∣gy, following the policy of their predeces∣sors the Druids, confined that knowledge to themselves.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">unfavour∣able to history.</NOTE> To record temporal events was not the first use made of letters by the religious of the middle ages. Miracles, visions, and the lives of saints, were more impor∣tant subjects, than the transactions of states and kingdoms, in the eyes of a race of men whose influence depended upon keeping mankind in the shades of igno∣rance
<PB N="3" REF="13"/>
and superstition. We find, ac∣cordingly, that monks and hermits be∣came illustrious in cells and in deserts, whilst the monarchs of Europe sat in ob∣scurity upon their thrones.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The feudal establish∣ments intro∣duce histori∣cal inquiry.</NOTE> The North, which, upon the decline of the Romans, had filled the provinces of the western empire with its colonies, sent abroad fresh armies of adventurers in the eighth and ninth ages. These, set∣tling in some of the regions of the South, gave a new turn to the genius of the Eu∣ropean nations. The feudal establish∣ments, introduced, or at least, revived and confirmed by them, gave stability to government, and were highly favourable to a spirit of national dignity and inde∣pendence. Lands and honours becoming hereditary, gave birth to a pride of family among the great barons; and they en∣deavoured to add lustre to the distinctions which they had acquired by tracing their ancestors through the same path of emi∣nence to a remote antiquity. From in∣dividuals this genealogical enthusiasm spread to whole communities. Men pos∣sessed of the little literature of the times, and a talent for fable, either through ig∣norance or vanity, indulged the romantic passions of an ignorant race of men, by deducing the origin of their respective na∣tions from very distant aeras. The anti∣quities of every country in Europe furnish∣ed
<PB N="4" REF="14"/>
an ample field of fiction; and it was impossible to form tales too extravagant or improbable for the credulity of the age. It is therefore no matter of wonder that we possess such a mass of legends for the ancient history of those nations, who, for many centuries, have made a figure in Europe.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The history of ancient Britain ne∣glected.</NOTE> The revival of critical learning has en∣abled foreigners to extricate, in a great measure, their antiquities from the fables of the middle ages: In Britain we con∣tent ourselves with looking back with contempt on the credulity of our ances∣tors. From a pride incident to polished times we are apt to think, and perhaps with some justice, that the transactions of the infancy of society are as unworthy of remembrance as they are imperfectly known. But this observation has been made, not more to depreciate our ances∣tors, than to cover a glaring defect in our∣selves. The British nations, till of late years, were much more remarkable for the performance of great actions in the field, than for recording them with digni∣ty and precision in the closet.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Design of the Author.</NOTE> Men of abilities have removed this re∣proach from the nation. The latter pe∣riods of our history are reduced into form and precision; but the early part of our annals still remains in the possession of fiction and romance. To dispel the
<PB N="5" REF="15"/>
shades which cover the antiquities of the British nations, to investigate their origin, to carry down some account of their cha∣racter, manners, and government, into the times of records and domestic writers, is the design of this introduction. The abilities of the Author are perhaps inade∣quate to so arduous an undertaking; but as he travels back into antiquity with some advantages which others have not possessed, he flatters himself that he shall be able to throw a new, if not a satis∣factory light, on a subject hitherto little understood. Though, for want of suffi∣cient guides, he should sometimes lose his way in a region of clouds and darkness, his hopes of the indulgence of the public are greater than his fears of their censure.</P>

<HEAD>The Celtae.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Two na∣tions, the celtae and Sarmatae, possessed Ancient Europe.</NOTE> The Greeks threw the first feeble light on the Barbarians of the North and West: They rose distinctly to view in the pro∣gress of the Roman arms. Two nations, in a great variety of tribes, possessed the vast continent of Europe. The Celtae extended themselves from the pillars of Hercules<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">Celtae occidua Europae usque ad Gades incolunt. <BIBL>Strabo, lib. ii.</BIBL></Q></NOTE> to the banks of the Vistula<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">Sarmatia, intus, quam ad mare latior, ab iis, quae sequuntur, Vistula amne discreta. <BIBL>Pomp. Mela, lib. iii.</BIBL></Q></NOTE> and Tanais<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">Circa Tanaim Sarmatarum gentes degunt. <BIBL>Plin. lib. ii.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>, from the Hellespont to the shores of the Baltic. The regions to the North-East of the Danube, from the Euxine Sea to the Frozen Ocean, were perambulated rather than inhabited by the European Sarmatae. Between the Baltic and the extremities of the North lay the ancient Scandinavians, whose posterity, upon the decline of the Romans, carried into the South undoubted proofs of their Sarmatic extract.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The name of Celtae</NOTE> The Scythians of the western Europe were, for the first time, mentioned un∣der the name of Celtae, by Herodotus, in the eighty-seventh Olympiad. To in∣vestigate
<PB N="7" REF="17"/>
the origin of that appellation we must return into a period of remote anti∣quity. The Pelasgi of Peloponnesus and the Islands of the Archipelago were the first of the European Nomades who quit∣ted the ambulatory life of their ancestors, and applied themselves to the arts of civil life. Induced by the fine climate of Greece, they settled in fixed abodes; while yet their rude brethren to the North wandered after their cattle or game over the face of Europe. Improving their navigation by degrees, they sailed to the West, seized upon the nearest coast of Italy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline"><GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <BIBL>Dion. Halic. lib. i.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>, and moving into the heart of that country, met with the Umbri, and rose into a mixed nation under the name of Latins. Extending their navigation still further into the Mediterranean, the Phoceans made an establishment on the coast of Gaul; Massilia was founded by those adventurers about the forty-fifth Olympiad, when the elder Tarquin is said to have held the reins of govern∣ment at Rome<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">Tempore Tarquinii regis ex Asia Phocensium ju∣ventus in ultimas Galliae sinus profectus, Massiliam condidit. <BIBL>Justin, lib. xliii.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>.</P>

The means of subsistence being augment∣ed, population increased of course; mi∣grating expeditions were formed to ease the country of its number of inhabitants, and the regions of Europe being traversed rather than peopled by the Nomades, re∣ceived successive swarms of Galic emi∣grants.

from Gaul, in whom the old inhabitants, if they differed originally from the Gaël, were lost. This revolution in the North of Europe extended to the greater part of its inhabitants the appellation of Celtae, which is an adjective derived from Gaël, the aboriginal name of the inhabitants of ancient Gaul.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Migrations of the Celtae, or Gaël.</NOTE> Though the expeditions of the Gauls, subsequent to the settlement of the Pho∣ceans in their country, are the first men∣tioned in history, we have reason to be∣lieve that they pervaded Europe with their migrating armies<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">Ferox natio pervagata bello prope orbem terra∣rum. <BIBL>Livius, lib. xxxviii.</BIBL></Q></NOTE> in a more remote pe∣riod of antiquity. They first entered Italy, according to Livy, in the reign of the elder Tarquin: but other writers of good credit affirm that they were, in part, the ancestors of the vagabonds who settled with Romulus on the banks of the Tiber. The Umbri, the most ancient inhabitants of Italy<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">Umbrorum gens antiquissima Italiae existimatur. <BIBL>Plin. lib. iii.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>, were Gauls<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">Umbri prima veterum Gallorum proles. <BIBL>Servius in Aeneid xii.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>; and from the Umbri the Tuscans and Sabins<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">Zenodotus Traezenius, qui Umbrorum historiam conscripsit, narrat Sabinos pro Umbris appellatos. <BIBL>Dionys. Halic. lib. ii.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>, who were the founders of Rome, derive their origin. It is upon the whole, evident that the Gaël who inhabited the
<PB N="10" REF="20"/>
vast country bounded by the ocean, the Rhine, the Alps, and Pyrenaean moun∣tains, were the ancestors of the Celtae, the extent of whose dominions we have already described<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">Galli a candore corporis primum appellati sunt. <BIBL>Eucher.

<HEAD>The Cimbri.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Cimbri derive their origin</NOTE> The domestic improvements which, in the beginning of their progress in Gaul, enabled the inhabitants of that country to overrun the regions of the West and North, had arrived at some degree of maturity long before the Romans pene∣trated beyond the Alps. Instead of wan∣dering in search of foreign settlements, the Gauls found it more convenient to cultivate those which they already posses∣sed. The spirit of conquest retired fur∣ther towards the North; and the tide of migration, which had for ages flowed from Gaul, returned upon itself with re∣doubled violence.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">from the Celtae, or Gaël.</NOTE> The extensive regions between the Rhine and the Baltic were possessed by Galic tribes when Germany became first known to the writers of Rome. An unavoidable mixture with the Sarmatae beyond the Vistula and the Baltic had an effect on the genius of the Celtae of Ger∣many; and they departed, in some de∣gree, from the purity of the language and from some of the manners of their ancestors. They however retained so many marks of their Galic origin, that some have thought that the name of Ger∣mans proceeded from their similarity in every respect to the inhabitants of Gaul<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">Forma et moribus et victu adsimiles sunt Gallo∣rum. Itaque rectè mihi videntur Romani hoc nomen eis indedisse cum eos fratres esse Gallorum vellent os∣tendere. <BIBL>Strabo, lib. vii.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their mi∣grations and conquests.</NOTE> More than three centuries prior to the Christian aera, the German Celtae, under the name of Cimbri, ravaged all the re∣gions lying between the Rhine and the Ionian sea<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">Hae sunt nationes quae tam longe ab suis sedibus Delphos profectae sunt. <BIBL>Cicero pro Fonteio, xx.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>. They at the same time ex∣tended their conquests to Spain and to

Great Britain. The Lusitanians, ac∣cording to Diodorus Siculus, were the most warlike branch of the Cimbri<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline"><GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <BIBL>Diod. Sic. lib. v.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>; and the Welsh retain, in their name, an undoubted mark of their Cimbric extracti∣on. From these revolutions of the Cel∣tae on the continent we shall, in a sub∣sequent section, deduce the origin of the British nations.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Irruption of the Europe∣an Sarmatae;</NOTE> The successive migrations of the Bar∣barians of the North may be compared to the transient storms of a showery day. The Sun scarce returns after one cloud is past, before another begins to gather in the same quarter of heaven. The short space between is filled with that pleasing but melancholy serenity which attends joys whose period is approaching in view.—The first irruption of the nations of the northern Germany happened, as we have already observed, more than three cen∣turies before the commencement of our present aera.

the Sarmatae; who, after having passed from Scandinavia, became their neigh∣bours in Germany. Instead of contend∣ing about the possession of the bleak shores of the Baltic, the Cimbri and Teutoni, in close alliance with one another, en∣deavoured to procure for themselves better settlements in a more favourable climate and soil.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Scan∣dinavian Sarmatae</NOTE> The Teutoni were the first of the Scan∣dinavian Sarmatae who invaded the South. The calamities which over∣whelmed those adventurers in their ex∣pedition, discouraged their countrymen for more than two complete centuries from similar attempts. In the reign of Marcus Aurelius, forgetting the misfor∣tunes of their fathers, the Sarmatic Germans advanced into the regions of the South and East<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Dio. Cass. lib. lxxi.</BIBL></NOTE>. A new bulwark a∣gainst their invasion had started up in the power of the Romans. The military discipline of the legions stationed on the frontiers of Pannonia frustrated all the efforts of the Barbarians, and obliged them to content themselves with the cold and sterile seats of their ancestors.

The northern nations, descended from the same stock who trod on their heels when they moved into the provinces of the Roman empire, are the ancestors of the present Germans.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Reflections.</NOTE> When fate had decreed the fall of the Romans she seemed to create Barbarians for the single purpose of executing her favourite design. Nations appeared sud∣denly on the frontiers of the empire un∣heard of by others, and even unknown to themselves. The memory of their former transactions was lost in their own ignorance, and the name of their original seats was as it were forgot in the length of their march. They seemed to move forward under an impression of the incon∣veniences they had left at home, more than from the hopes of success abroad; having philosophy enough to prefer the uncertainty of future evils to present mi∣sery.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Origin and progress of the Slavi.</NOTE> The most obscure of those Barbarians who contributed to the destruction of the western empire were the Slavi, whose posterity now possess all the regions be∣tween the Euxine and the Frozen Ocean. Under the name of Avari they advanced even as far as Peloponnesus in the fifth century, and under that of Bulgarians they continued their irruptions into the South till the end of the eighth age. Pursuing and flying from one another, in successive mi∣grations, they filled the western Russia,

Poland, and the regions near the mouths of the Danube, with their colonies; and, having at last settled in fixed abodes, started up into several powerful nations.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A different people from the Euro∣pean Sar∣matae.</NOTE> The Slavi seem, from their language as well as manners, to derive their origin from the Tartars of the North-East of Asia. They were a very different race of men from the Scandinavian Sarmatae, the principals in the migrating expediti∣ons which proved fatal to the Roman power. When the Goths, quitting their native seats to the East of the Vistula, had advanced into Rhetia, Gaul, and Italy, the Slavi took possession of their habitations<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">Ubi ergo Poloniam finem facit, pervenitur ad Sla∣vorum amplissimam provinciam.</Q></NOTE>.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">though de∣scended from the Celtic stock,</NOTE> The British Cimbri derived their ori∣gin from the Galic colonies, who, in remote antiquity, had settled beyond the Rhine. These, with a small mixture of the Sarmatae, returned, in all their ori∣ginal barbarism, into the regions of the South. During their separation from their mother nation, their language and manners must have suffered such a consi∣derable change, that it is extremely doubtful whether their dialect of the Celtic and that of the old British Gaël were, at the arrival of the former in this Island, reciprocally understood by
<PB N="36" REF="46"/>
both nations.—The third colony differed in every thing from the Gaël and Cimbri. Their manners were more humanized; and their tongue, though perhaps corrupted, was more copious.

The Ca∣ledonians were not more destitute of the means of preserving their history in the intermediate century between Agricola and Severus, than their posterity were for a considerable time after the Romans had relinquished the dominion of Britain.

Had the Romans established themselves in Caledonia, we might in∣deed have known more of the ancient inhabitants of that country; but it is much to be doubted whether the Scots of this age would have been more con∣cerned in their history, than the English of Middlesex and Essex are in the tran∣sactions of the Trinobantes, who posses∣sed those counties in the time of Julius Caesar. The Romans, it is true, intro∣duced the arts of civil life into the coun∣tries which they subdued; but with those arts came in slavery, and a consequent imbecillity of mind, which, in the end, abandoned the vassals, as well as their lords, to conquest, and even to extirpa∣tion.</P>

But Innes was more successful in destroying the in∣digested accounts of others, than in esta∣blishing a more rational system of his own. Setting out upon wrong princi∣ples, and being an utter stranger to the Galic language, he fell into unavoidable mistakes; and endeavoured to obtrude upon the world opinions, concerning the origin of the Scots, no less improbable than those tales which he had exploded with so much success.

The name by which the celebrated writer himself distinguishes their country, is sufficient to demonstrate that they came from a very different quarter of the continent than what he supposed. When the arms of the empire under Julius Agricola laid open all the nations of Britain to the enquiry of the Romans, it has been already observed that the whole island was possessed by three nations, whom Tacitus endeavours to deduce from communities on the con∣tinent very distant from one another. The posterity of two of those nations preserve, to this day, in their names, proofs that altogether subvert this opinion.

This vicinity of Ireland had probably drawn partial emigrations from Caledonia before the arrival of the Cimbri in Bri∣tain; but when these interlopers pressed upon the Gaël from the south, it is rea∣sonable to conclude the numerous colo∣nies passed over into an island so near,

the first colony of the ancient Gauls who transmigrated into Britain, and DOCH, a district or division of a country.

But they became so numerous in that country before the arrival of the Belgae in Britain, that the colonies which transmigrated from that nation into Ireland were, together with their language, manners, and customs, lost in the Gaël; so that in one sense the Caledonians may be reckoned the sole progenitors of the old Irish<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Firbolg, so often mentioned in the traditions of the Irish, were Belgic colonies who transmigrated from Britain after the Belgae had seized on the southern division of England.

One of two reasons induced the illustri∣ous writer to use that appellation. He either latinized the HYVERDHON of the southern Britains, or, what is more probable, he annexed to Ireland a name which suited his own ideas of its air and climate. The Romans, long after the expedition of Caesar, entertained a very unfavourable opinion of the climate of Ireland: Strabo thought that the severity of the weather rendered that Island ex∣tremely uncomfortable<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Strabo, lib. ii.</BIBL></NOTE>, and Pomponius Mela was told that corn never ripened there on account of the inclemency of the seasons<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">Supra, Britanniam Juverna est . . . . . . coeli ad maturanda semina iniqui. <BIBL>Pomp.

In∣stead of transmigrating from the nearest continent, in the natural progress of migra∣tion, it seems that the first colonies came to Ireland, across an immense ocean, at a period when the rude navigation of the other nations of Europe scarcely en∣abled them to waft themselves over rivers and narrow arms of the sea.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">from the form of their alpha∣bet;</NOTE> The arbitrary order in which the Irish of the middle ages placed their alphabet, and the fanciful appellations they gave them, prove only that the Hibernian Se∣nachies formed a very early design to de∣ceive the world on the article of their an∣tiquities. But arguments arising from those two circumstances can only deceive those who have not compared old Irish manuscripts with the records of any other nation in Europe, prior to the invention of printing. The perfect indentity ob∣servable in the forms of the letters in both sufficiently confutes this idle tale, unless we are to suppose that the Irish, and not the Romans, humanized and taught let∣ters to all the European nations.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">from the improbabi∣lity of their assertions.</NOTE> It is unnecessary, with Bolandus and Innes, to pursue the abettors of the pre∣tended literature of Ireland, before the mission of St. Patrick, through all the maze of a contest, in which positive as∣sertions, on the side of the latter, supply the place of argument. To a brief detail of some other unanswerable objections advanced by the two learned writers, we shall annex some additional observations, to put an end for ever to the dispute. Keating, O'Flaherty, and Toland, up∣on the authority of the book of <HI>Lecan,</HI> a manuscript scarcely three hundred and fifty years old, affirm that one Phenius Farsa invented the Hebrew, Greek,
<PB N="70" REF="80"/>
Latin, and Irish alphabets, together with the Ogum of Ireland, little more than a century after the universal deluge. A legend which says that the Greek al∣phabet was invented many ages before Cecrops and Cadmus, and the Latin characters seventeen centuries before the Romans were a people, is too ridiculous to deserve any serious consideration. But this idle story is not more pregnant with absurdity than the mention that is made of Adam, Cain, Noah, the deluge, Moses, Pharaoh, and many other names and transactions in the old testament, in annals said to have been written many ages before Christianity introduced into Europe any knowledge of the Jewish history and antiquities.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ogum a species of stenogra∣phy.</NOTE> The Irish being in some measure ob∣liged to acknowledge that the Bethluis∣nion, notwithstanding the arbitrary trans∣portation of the letters, and the puerile fancy of imposing upon them the names of trees, by the Bards and Senachies of the middle ages, was borrowed from the Latin, still continue to insist that their ancestors in remote antiquity, made use of characters distinguished by the name of Ogum. Ogum is a word which has no affinity with any other in the Irish language, and seems therefore to have been a cant-name imposed upon a species of stenography or cypher, in which the
<PB N="71" REF="81"/>
old Irish, like many other nations, wrote their secrets. Sir James Ware, whose authority is often cited to prove the ex∣istence of the Ogum, shews plainly that it was a kind of short hand, varied ac∣cording to the fancy of those that used it, and consequently that it did not merit the title of an alphabet<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">Praeter Caracteres vulgares utebantur veteres Hi∣berni variis occultls scribendi formulis, seu artificiis <HI>Ogum</HI> dictis, quibus secreta sua scribebant. <BIBL>Ware, de Antiq.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Contradic∣tions be∣tween the ancient and modern Irish anna∣lists.</NOTE> There is no circumstance more con∣clusive against the learning of the Pagan Irish, than the contradictions between the ancient writers, and those of the modern annalists of Ireland. The anti∣quaries of that country, in proportion as the general history of the world became more and more known to them, reformed, new-modelled, and retrenched the ex∣travagancies of the first rude draught of Hibernian antiquities formed by the Bards and Fileas. Had letters been cul∣tivated in Ireland in so early a period as is pretended, systems of the history of that country would have been so anciently formed, and so well established by the sanction of their antiquity, that neither Keating or O'Flaherty durst, in the se∣venteenth age, give a compleat turn to the Irish antiquities. But that no such system was formed, is demonstrable from
<PB N="72" REF="82"/>
the silence concerning the times of Hea∣thenism, in the most ancient annals of Ireland, of the existence of which we have any satisfactory proof<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">These are the annals of Ulster, Tigernach, and Innisfail, all of which begin the history of Ireland a∣bout the middle of the fifth age, and end in the eleventh century. <BIBL>Vid.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Decisive proof a∣gainst the pretended literature of the old Irish.</NOTE> To close with one decisive argument this controversy: It is to be observed that the settlement of the Milesians, un∣der the name of Scots, in Ireland, about a thousand years before the Christian aera, is the capital point established by the pretended literature of the Heathen Irish. Should this early settlement be once as∣certained, it naturally ought to follow that the British Scots derived their blood from those of Ireland; if they did, they must have carried with them to Caledo∣nia that learning, science, and civility, which had made so great a progress in their mother-country before they transmigrated from it. But nothing is more certain than that the British Scots were an illi∣terate people, and involved in barbarism, even after St. Patrick's mission to the Scots of Ireland. The abettors of the Irish antiquities are then reduced into this dilemma; either the Scots of North Britain did not derive their origin from Ireland, or else the Irish had not any
<PB N="73" REF="83"/>
knowledge of letters when the British Scots transmigrated from their country. If the first position is true, the whole credit of the Milesian story is at an end; if the latter, on the other hand, is the fact, no memory remains in Ireland of transactions prior to the mission of St. Pa∣trick, and the reign of Leogaire.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">General conclusions.</NOTE> From the general result of our enquiry upon this subject, we may conclude with Sir James Ware, that nothing certain is known concerning the affairs of Ireland before the middle of the fifth age<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">Ad predecessores Leogarii quod attinet, eos certe consilio omisi quia pleraque quae de iis traduntur, ut quod sentio dicam, vel fabulae sunt, vel fabulis et ana∣chronismis mire admixta. <BIBL>War. de Antiq.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Irish writers reprehend∣ed</NOTE> It is a matter of some wonder that the Irish remain so long wedded to a ridicu∣lous system of antiquities, which throws the reproach of credulity upon their na∣tion.

Had there been a scar∣city of men of abilities and learning in Ireland, some excuse might be framed for this blind attachment to the legends of the bards. But as that country hath pro∣duced very able men, and qualified to form a solid foundation for a true history of their ancestors, they deserve to be se∣verely animadverted upon, for not rescu∣ing their antiquities, from that obscurity and fiction in which they have been in∣volved, by some modern, prejudiced, and injudicious writers.</P>

<HEAD>ANTIQUITIES OF THE British and Irish Scots.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="subsection">
<HEAD>Preliminary Observations.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">General ob∣servation.</NOTE> THE dark regions of Irish antiquity oppose more than their barrenness to inquiry. To the common gloom, which covers the origin of other nations, the Bards of Ireland have added clouds of their own. The desart of their ancient history, to use a metaphor, is haunted by goblins and strange forms, which distract the attention and offend the eye. To encounter the absurdities which the more ancient Irish posses for the annals of their remote ages, is not an arduous, but a disagreeable and tedious task. The field is ample, but it produces no laurels; the combat is not dangerous, but the victory will be attended by no same. But the professed design of this work gives propriety to a minute inquiry into the pretensions of Ireland to high anti∣quities, and the public, it is hoped, will
<PB N="76" REF="86"/>
forgive the prolixity of the disquisition, on account of the necessity which has imposed so dry a subject upon the Author.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Conclusions against the domestic accounts of the Irish.</NOTE> From the principles already established we may draw the following just conclu∣sions: That the history of the Milesian colony, which, it is pretended, transmi∣grated from Spain into Ireland under the conduct of Heremon and Heber, is ab∣solutely unworthy of any credit: That the long list of kings, who are said to have held the scepter of Ireland, for thirteen centuries before the Christian aera, had their existence only in the dis∣tempered fancies of the Bards of latter ages; and, in short, that every thing re∣lated in their domestic annals concerning the Irish, prior to the mission of St. Pa∣trick, ought to be banished to the region of fiction and romance. Whatever drea∣mers in remote antiquities may be pleased to say, it is an indisputable fact, that the transactions of a nation, illiterate in itself, and too distant or obscure to be distinctly seen by foreign writers, must for ever lie buried in oblivion. The Irish, we have already seen, were so far from having the advantage of the Greeks and Romans in an earlier knowledge of let∣ters<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ken. Geneal. pref. p. 26.</BIBL></NOTE>, that, on the contrary, they re∣mained
<PB N="77" REF="87"/>
much longer in ignorance than the inhabitants of the regions of the West and North, whom the latter of those il∣lustrious nations subdued and humanized.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">History of Ireland commences with St. Patrick.</NOTE> The only means the old Irish had to preserve the memory of their actions were the rhimes of the Bards, a race of men retained by the illiterate nations de∣scended from the great Celtic stock. Without insisting on the known uncer∣tainty of history in rhime, we may affirm that a dull narrative of facts in verse could never take hold of the human mind in a degree sufficient to transmit a knowledge of events, by oral tradition, through any considerable length of time. Granting then every possible indulgence to the tra∣ditionary history of Ireland, we cannot admit that it extends much beyond the middle of the fifth age, if even to record the rhimes of the Heathen Bards had been the first use made of the alphabet intro∣duced by St. Patrick. But as it is not, in any degree, probable that the first con∣verts in Ireland would employ their time in collecting and recording historical poems, which were tinctured, perhaps, with the ancient superstition, we may naturally place the commencement of the fabulous, as well as of the true history of that Island, posterior to the introduction of Christianity.</P>

<HEAD>Spanish Extraction of the Irish examined and confuted.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Spanish ex∣traction of the Irish before the Christian aera</NOTE> The Irish annalists have, for many ages, adhered invariably to the pretended descent of their nation from the old Spa∣niards. The confidence with which they have always spoken on this subject, in∣duced some learned men, who gave no credit to an early knowledge of letters in Ireland, to suppose that there was some foundation in fact for a story, concerning which, tradition had brought intimations from every quarter. But to those who have well considered the state of ancient Europe, it will appear just as improbable that the Spaniards could transport them∣selves into Ireland before the Christian aera, as it is impossible to believe that any memory of that event, had it actually happened, could have been preserved by tradition to the introduction of letters by St. Patrick.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">highly im∣probable.</NOTE> It does not appear that much of the knowledge of the arts of civil life was extended to the inhabitants of the moun∣tains of Asturia and Gallicia, from the settlement established by the Phoenicians in the Island of Gades. So far were the

old Spaniards, who possessed the shore of the Atlantic, from improving themselves in navigation by their vicinity to the ocean, that Strabo affirms<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline"><GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <BIBL>Strabo, lib. iii.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>, that from their situation they were cut off from all commerce with the rest of mankind.

But if a small skill in one of the earliest and rudest arts entitled the Vaccaei to the character of a civilized people, when compared to the neighbouring tribes, we may, with jus∣tice, conclude that those tribes had not made a progress in navigation sufficient to make them venture into the ocean, and transport a colony into Ireland.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dropt as in∣defensible.</NOTE> The scheme of deducing the Irish Scotch from the Spaniards prior to the Christian aera, was dropt as indefensible by those of the most learning and judg∣ment, who examined the subject. After Innes had destroyed the credit of the

Innes is the only writer who has reduced the origin of the Scots into a regular system; and he endeavours to defend it. Should the in∣genious father's scheme be destroyed, the Caledonian extraction of the Irish must of course rise upon its ruins. The Scots, says Innes, were foreigners who invaded or conquered Ireland in the first age of Christianity.

It is difficult to com∣prehend why a mixture of foreign blood should be necessary to make the Irish a warlike people.

But if a

Tacitus says, and indeed it is common sense, that many Britons fled into Ireland from the tyranny of the Romans.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ptolomy.</NOTE> Ptolemy, who wrote under the Anto∣nines, has not once mentioned the Scots, though he is very minute with regard to inferior tribes settled in Ireland. The geographer found in the lesser Britain the Brigantes, Vellabori, Cauci, and Me∣napii, but the redoubtable Scots of Can∣tabria totally escaped his notice. Camden, willing to humour the Irish in their pre∣tensions to a Spanish extract, has ob∣served that the Lucensii and Concani were neighbours in Spain, as the Luceni and Gongani were in Hibernia. If this is an argument, others of the same kind and of equal force may be produced to oppose it. The Cauci and Menapii were neighbours in Germany, and so were tribes of the same name, according to Ptolemy, in Ireland. Shall we then bring some Irish tribes from Cantabria, others from Germany, transport the Brigantes from South Britain, and totally exclude all emigrants from Caledonia, which is with∣in

a few leagues of the Irish shore? Camden's observation might have been extended further; the Iberians and Alba∣nians were contiguous to one another in Asia; the Hibernians and Albanians pos∣sessed the British Isles, divided from one another by a very narrow channel; and ought we from that circumstance to infer, that the Caledonians and Irish came from the shores of the Caspian?</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Orosius,</NOTE> In the days of Orosius the Irish were distinguished by the name of Scottish clans. Orosius does not say from whence these Scottish tribes transmigrated into Ireland. Though a Spaniard himself, he has not mentioned, in treating of the Cantabric war, a circumstance that would have done honour to his country; that a great body of the Cantabri, rather than submit to Augustus, or to skulk in moun∣tains and desarts, or throw in despair their lives away like many of their countrymen, committed themselves to the Ocean, and acquired in Ireland better settlements than those for which they contended, with so much unavailing bravery against the Ro∣mans.</P>

The greatest part of the Cantabri, according to Florus, after being hard pressed both by sea and land, driven out of their fastnesses, hunted down like wild beasts, and, at last, in∣closed within lines of circumvallation, rescued themselves from slavery by a vo∣luntary death. A series of similar mis∣fortunes pursued the Asturians; after having inclosed themselves within walls, they were taken by the armies of Rome, the whole nation were transplanted from their native mountains to the plain coun∣try, and an end for ever put to Spanish insurrections.</P>

They conse∣quently remained an unmixed people, and the simplicity of their manners preserved their language from corruption. A simi∣lar situation had a similar effect on the Scots of the British Isles. The north of Scotland received no colonies in any pe∣riod that can be assigned; and the Irish remained, in a great measure, unmixed until the English conquest of their coun∣try. But notwithstanding circumstances common to the Cantabri and the Scots of both our Isles, the language of the latter has less affinity with the modern Bis∣cayan, than the English tongue has with

that of the Moguls of the eastern Tar∣tary<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That the language of the mountaineers of Gali∣cia, and that part of Spain which stretches along the Bay of Biscay, bears a near analogy to the language of the old Irish, has been an axiom universally admitted.

Unfortunately for the old Hibernian system, a dictio∣nary of the Biscayan language is, at this moment, in the possession of the Author of the Introduction, and he publickly declares that there is less affinity between the Biscayan and Irish languages, than between the latter and the tongue of the most distant nations in the eastern Asia.

The language of the modern Biscayans, it is certain, bears no affinity to the other European tongues, which are radically de∣scended from the ancient Celtic. The name of Iberi∣ans given to them in contradistinction to the Celtae is a proof of their being a different people. Lucan seems to insinuate this fact in a line already quoted; Gallo∣rum Celtae <HI>miscentes</HI> nomen Iberis; and the Venere Celtae <HI>sociati</HI> nomen Iberis of Silius Italicus, together with the express testimony of Diodorus Siculus and Appian, confirms the opinion.</NOTE>.</P>

It must be acknowledged that the ancients sometimes distinguished the Germans, as well as those nations who inhabited beyond the Baltic, by the name of Scythians. But it is extremely puerile to infer, from the remote analogy between the name of Scythians and Scots, that the latter nation derived their blood either from the Germans or old Scandi∣navians. The Danes, for a similar rea∣son, might deduce themselves from the Danai of Greece; and the Caledonians of North Britain trace themselves to those of the same name in Aetolia.</P>

When Domitian held the reins of government at Rome, the Germans attempted the conquest of Gaul, and they gave much trouble to many of his successors in the imperial dignity. The Romans, says Cornelius Tacitus<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">Proximis temporibus triumphati magis quam victi. <BIBL>Tacit. de Mor.

In the attempts of the Germans upon that country, in the reign of Augustus, they lost a great number of their bravest soldiers; and the expeditions of Drusus depopulated whole districts of their country. Tiberius was not less successful in Germany than his brother Drusus, nor his many victories less de∣structive to the inhabitants of that coun∣try<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Velleius Paterculus, lib. i.</BIBL></NOTE>.

Germany, during that fatal period, was involved in civil wars. The ill-timed animosities between Arminius and Segestes, the ravages of Maroboduus,
<PB N="92" REF="102"/>
and the invasion of the Romans, made it a scene of unparalleled miseries. It is therefore certain that Germany, in the first century, was more depopulated, than it was in any former or after period, if we except the time in which the Franks, Allemans, and Lombards, evacuated their territories to settle themselves in more fertile countries<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It must be confessed that several tribes in the North-East angle of Scotland have preserved in their traditions, and the genealogical histories of their fami∣lies, pretensions to a German origin.

Though this opinion very probably took its rise from an identity of names, it is far from being unlikely that some Celto-Germanic tribes transmigrated, at different times, into that part of Britain which was not subject to the Romans; but it is morally impossible that a migration, sufficient to people Caledonia and Ireland, could have happened, without falling within the knowledge of the writers of Rome, who certainly extended their enquiries to the transactions of the wild nations on the frontiers of the empire.</NOTE>.</P>

<HEAD>General Reflections.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">General observation.</NOTE> NATIONS find it difficult to divest themselves of a partiality for sys∣tems of antiquity, which, to the sanction of ages, have added the authority of learned men. The Scots of both the British Isles were former peculiarly at∣tached to the absurd tales, with which their bards had covered their origin. Many still retain the unmanly credulity, which has been the reproach of their ancestors, and think it a kind of sacri∣lege to disperse the gloom, which involves the commencements of their history. The Author of the Introduction writes not for these; he has taken up arms against fiction and romance, and he will not lay them down till the whole are subdued. In destroying the fantastic fables, which deform the obscurity of our ancient his∣tory, he may perhaps bury whole ages in darkness; but oblivion itself is better than inauthentic fame. The credit of the Milesian tale is already destroyed, and it is perhaps superfluous to refute the pre∣tended Hibernian extraction of the Scots
<PB N="95" REF="105"/>
Both stories depend upon the same autho∣rity, and they must both fall by the same argument. But to close for ever a contest, which, though not material in itself, has employed the pens of many learned men, and attracted the attention of nations, we must discuss the point at more length than its importance deserves.</P>

The history of Caledonia, before the Roman eagles were displayed beyond the friths, must for ever remain in impenetrable darkness. Both countries were peopled many ages before the reign of Domitian, but how they were governed, or by what petty chieftains or kings, a Scottish or Irish Berosus can only tell. Had a hundred Hibernian colonies, with a royal Milesian at the head of each, transmigrated into North Britain, before the Roman arms penetrated into Caledo∣nia, they must, without a revelation from heaven, remain involved in eternal ob∣livion.
<PB N="96" REF="106"/>
It is as ridiculous to assert, as it would be downright anility to believe, that Caledonia received an Irish colony before Tacitus wrote the life of Agricola. To prove that no Irish colony transmi∣grated into Britain in or after the reign of Domitian, it is proper to review what the Romans have communicated concern∣ing the state of Caledonia from that period to the appearance of the Scots on the frontiers of the province.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Second ar∣gument.</NOTE> In vain will it be objected that the Ro∣man commander might have been mista∣ken in his calculation of the internal strength of Ireland. He had in his camp an Irish prince who was no stranger to the state of his own country. Should it be supposed that this exile, from a desire of inducing Agricola to undertake an expedition, which might re-establish him∣self in his dominions, gave a false account of Ireland, the Roman was too prudent to rely altogether on the intelligence of the Hibernian fugitive. The ports of Ireland were, in those times, better known than those of Britain; and Agricola must
<PB N="98" REF="108"/>
have consulted those who traded into that country concerning the force of an Island which he intended to invade<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Tacit. Vit. Agric. xxiv.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Third argu∣ment.</NOTE> We may therefore conclude that Agri∣cola formed, upon good intelligence, a just idea of the state of Ireland, and con∣sequently that it was very thinly peopled, or that the military character of its inha∣bitants, on account of their extreme bar∣barism, was very low. In either of these situations it is not in any degree probable, that the Irish, in the days of Domitian, would have made any attempts to settle in Caledonia; or that those whom one legion was sufficient to subdue at home, could make conquests abroad, among a people who employed the whole force of the Roman army.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Fourth ar∣gument.</NOTE> It is difficult to ascertain with exactness the number of the troops of Agricola in his Caledonian expedition. Josephus says that there were four legions stationed in Britain in the days of Domitian. We learn from Tacitus, that Agricola, at one period of the Caledonion war, divided his army into three bodies. The enemy at∣tacked one of those divisions consisting of the ninth legion, which, according to the established maxim of the Romans, must have been supported by a proportionable
<PB N="99" REF="109"/>
number of auxiliaries. Upon the whole we may conclude, that the two counties of Argyle and Dumbarton opposed, for a campaign, thrice the number of troops, that, according to Agricola's opinion, was sufficient to conquer the whole kingdom of Ireland.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Fifth argu∣ment.</NOTE> Had there been in the time of Agricola an Hibernian colony settled in the western Caledonia, who had resolution and num∣bers sufficient to oppose that great man, it is impossible that their mother coun∣try could have been represented by him in so despicable a light.

It will, perhaps, be thought unnecessary to confute these unauthorized assertions, after what has been already said concerning the faith due to Irish history before the time of St. Patrick.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Improba∣ble.</NOTE> Crimothan the first, it would appear, held the reins of government in Ireland, when Agricola carried the Roman arms into Caledonia.

Tacitus was extremely unjust to the happy valour of Crimothan against the Romans. The illustrious Crimothan, the supreme king of Ireland, was, it seems, inferior in command, in birth and valour, to the chieftain who was at the
<PB N="101" REF="111"/>

Tacitus expressly affirms, that Galgacus was superior, in those respects, to all the leaders of that army which fought Agri∣cola near the Grampian mountains<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">Inter plures duces genere et virtute praestans. <BIBL>Tacit.

their former strength during the long tranquility which succeeded the de∣parture of Agricola, and continued to the reign of Hadrian.

The inhabitants of North Britain ceased to be distinguished by the name of Caledonians about the close of the fourth age; so that the Mi∣lesian system must have been fabricated in a period so modern as to place the fourth century beyond the reach of tradition.

The exploits of Carausius are mere fiction, and the feats of Constantine and his father Chlorus in Caledonia existed only in the rants of ecclesiastical panegyrists. The frequent contests for the purple, between men sometimes called emperors and some∣times tyrants and usurpers, in proportion as they were near or far distant from the capital; the public distractions which arose naturally from these disputes, the growing imbecillity of the empire, and the invasions of the Barbarians of the northern Europe, diverted the attention of the Romans from Caledonia.

<HEAD>Proved from various Arguments.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">First argu∣ment.</NOTE> Bede is the first writer who positively affirms that the Scots of Britain derived their origin from those of Ireland. Whe∣ther they originally obtained from the Picts the principality of Iar-gaël or Ar∣gyle by force or treaty, was a point which all his historical and traditional knowledge did not enable the venerable Anglo-Saxon to determine. The incapacity of Bede, who lived so near the pretended transmi∣gration of the Irish, to solve this difficulty, is a kind of demonstration that the whole story is a fiction, imposed upon that credulous, though pious writer.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Second argument.</NOTE> If the Picts were so seeble that a band of Irish adventurers could tear from them one third of their dominions, how came they so frequently to provoke the Roman legions, and harass the provincials from the time of Chlorus to the total dere∣liction of Britain by Honorius? To invade the territories of a warlike and disciplined people when they suffered a great part of their own to be wrested from them by a despicable enemy, is a folly too absurd to gain any credit. But perhaps the Picts
<PB N="109" REF="119"/>
gave the district of Argyle to their allies of Ireland, in consideration of services against the Romans. These services were extremely unnecessary; for the Romans, till provoked by incursions, were very in∣offensive towards the Barbarians beyond the walls. Nations, in short, have been known to receive foreigners into the bosom of their country to repel invasions, but it is ridiculous to think that any people would have recourse to so dangerous an expedient for the pleasure of harrassing neighbours who did not in any degree offend them.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Third argu∣ment.</NOTE> It is difficult for the unprejudiced part of mankind to believe, that a colony, sufficient to occupy the western Highlands and Isles, could have wafted themselves, their wives, and children, at once, from Ireland into the northern Britain, in <HI>Cur∣raghs</HI> or miserable skiffs, whose hulls of wicker were wrapped up in a cow's hide. In these wretched vessels, it is true, an irregular communication was kept up be∣tween both the Islands; but the naviga∣tion was dangerous, and performed only in the fairest days of summer<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">Mare quod Britanniam et Hiberniam interluit un∣dosum et inquietum, toto in anno non nisi aestivis pau∣culis diebus est navigabile.

<PB N="110" REF="120"/>
fertility of the soil of Iar-ghaël could never be an inducement to an Irish mi∣gration into that division of Caledonia. If poverty, or their being overstocked with numbers, compelled the inhabitants of the pretended Dalrietta, or the <HI>Route</HI> in the county of Antrim, to go in quest of foreign settlements, they ought in common prudence to have tried their fortune in the southern division of their own country, and not in the sterile moun∣tains of the western Caledonia.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Fourth ar∣gument.</NOTE> The Irish must have been wonderfully improved in military knowledge from the days of Agricola, if it was more difficult in the fourth century to extort part of their dominions from them, than from the Caledonians, who had better oppor∣tunies to be enured to arms. Turgesius and his Norwegians did not find, in an after age, that the Irish were so obstinately tenacious of their fertile lands, as the posterity of the Picts were of their own barren country, when repeatedly attacked by all the efforts of Scandinavia.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Fifth argu∣ment.</NOTE> Should it be supposed that a band of adventurers were expelled from Ulster by the pressure of the southern Irish, it is difficult to account how the Picts of Bri∣tain should receive the fugitives. Either generosity or selfishness would have prompted them, like the Earl of Pem∣broke,
<PB N="111" REF="121"/>
to assist the exiles in recovering their territories; and, by that means, to endeavour to conquer a part of a fine country for themselves. But the Picts were, it seems, strangers to the most common maxims of policy; for, accord∣ing to the system under consideration, they must have been of all nations the most tame, prodigal, and imprudent. In short, if the Irish Scots voluntarily abandoned one of the best districts of Ireland to set∣tle in one of the most sterile divisions of North Britain, they must have been more absurd than the Hibernians of latter ages have been, perhaps very unjustly, repre∣sented; if by violence they were driven from home, the Picts deserve the same character for permitting a band of vaga∣bonds to seize upon one third of their dominions.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sixth argu∣ment.</NOTE> The Saxon auxiliaries of Vortigern were not so modest as the Irish Scots; or else the Picts were a people of much less spirit than the southern Britons. When the Saxons raised their demands to an unreasonable height, the Britons disputed with them every inch of ground. They were at last overpowered; but it was after such an expence of time and blood, that glory covered them in the midst of ruin. Had the Hibernian mer∣cenaries encroached upon the Picts, as the
<PB N="112" REF="122"/>
Saxons did on the Britons, we might naturally suppose that the latter, instead of carrying war and desolation into a foreign country, in conjunction with the Scots, would have found employment for their arms at home. The unanimity in expedition which subsisted for ages be∣tween the Caledonian nations, is proof sufficient that they derived their origin from one and the same source.</P>

<HEAD>THE PRETENDED TESTIMONY OF FOREIGN WRITERS EXAMINED, AND CONFUTED.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="subsection">
<HEAD>General Reflections.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">First ap∣pearance of the Scots.</NOTE> ABOUT the middle of the fourth age, the unconquered barbarians of Caledonia became known to the Ro∣mans under the name of Picts and Scots. Marcellinus, who is the first historian who met them in Britain, was an abso∣lute stranger to their being a new people, who then made their appearance in the island<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Amm. Marcell. lib. xx.</BIBL> The very learned and ingenious Dr. Macpherson has, in his critical disserta∣tion on the British and Irish Scots, proved against the bishop of St. Asaph, that Ammianus Marcellinus does not furnish even an obscure hint, that the Scots were a new people in Britain, in the reign of Constantius.</NOTE>. In the period of time between the expedition of Julius Agricola and the reign of Constantius we have already seen, that the improbability of the transmigra∣tion of a foreign colony into North Bri∣tain is so great that, without positive evi∣dence, the story can never be believed. The abettors of the Hibernian antiquities,
<PB N="114" REF="124"/>
finding that the credit of the domestic annals of Ireland could never establish this fact, had recourse to some passages of foreign writers, which they wrested to their purpose.</P>
<P>The impossibility of an Irish migration into North Britain between the reign of Constantius and the dereliction of Britain by Honorius, is supported by arguments equally strong with those we have pro∣duced for the period before the first of those emperors. Those who after Con∣stantius succeeded to the imperial purple, till the days of Valentinian, were rather insulted than feared by the wild nations of Caledonia. The latter, therefore, were under no necessity to implore the assistance of foreign auxiliaries; neither can we suppose that they would cede to a pitiful band of Irish barbarians any part of those territories, which they defended, with so much spirit, against the disciplined armies of the lords of the world.</P>

<HEAD>Claudian.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Claudian's pretended authority</NOTE> The supporters of the Hibernian ex∣traction of the British Scots pretend to have found in Claudian a direct proof of their system. That Poet, in his pane∣gyric on Theodosius, has the following lines.
<Q><L>Quid rigor aeternus coeli; quid sidera prosunt,</L>

Claudian indulged all the wantonness of a poetical fancy in this panegyric on Theodosius. It was the poet's imagination only that <Q REND="inline">"warmed Thule with Pictish blood, moistened the sands of Orkney with Saxon gore, and thawed the frozen Ierne into tears for the slaughter of the Scots."</Q>
<PB N="116" REF="126"/>
It is idle, in short, to search for fact in the hyperboles of poetry; Marcellinus, though particularly fond of Theodosius, has not recorded these prodigies of valour: Even Latinus Pacatius, though a pane∣gyrist, says no more, than that the Scot was driven back to his native fens<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">Redactum in paludes suas Scottum. <BIBL>Latin.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">examined,</NOTE> Without insisting upon what shall here∣after appear at least probable, that Ireland is not meant by the Ierne of Claudian, we may aver, that there is nothing in these verses decisive concerning the origin of the Scots. If the Hibernians were of Ca∣ledonian extract; if, from the ancient ties of consanguinity, a friendly inter∣course was maintained between the Irish and the inhabitants of Albany; a person of a less warm imagination than Claudian might suppose that the former sincerely lamented the misfortunes of their mother nation<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Should it be admitted that the Scots of Valenti∣nian's time were skilled in maritime affairs, and had passed from Ireland into North Britain, they ought, after Theodosius had chased them to their vessels, to have directed their flight to their native island.

<P>It will be hereafter shewn that the name of Ierna may, without any violence,

be applied to the western division of Scot∣land, including the isles: But should the Ierna of Claudian be the same with Ire∣land, it would little avail the abettors of that system which we now oppose. There is no necessity to believe that the poet adhered to historical fact.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A critical remark.</NOTE> Not to insist upon the improbability that the Irish in that state of barbarism in which they were certainly involved to∣wards the close of the fourth age, could annually transport armies into Britain, we may safely affirm, that the Tethys of Claudian was rather agitated into a foam by Saxon than by Hibernian oars. The Saxons, in the days of Honorius, were
<PB N="119" REF="129"/>
in some measure a maritime people; Tethys signifies the ocean: the sea be∣tween Germany and England has some right to that title, but the channel be∣tween Ireland and Caledonia was never dignified with so high a name. This cri∣ticism is sufficient to destroy the whole force of the argument drawn from Clau∣dian. It appears not from history that the Scots ever infested the Roman divi∣sion of Britain by sea: Constantine ap∣pointed an officer called <HI>Comes littoris Sax∣onici,</HI> to take the charge of part of the coast of the province, which was most exposed to the piratical depredations of the Saxons; but of a <HI>Comes littoris Scottici Hibernici</HI> we have never heard.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Conclusive arguments.</NOTE> If the province of Valentia comprehend∣ed the country between the walls, why did not the Hibernian Scots land every other season in Galloway?

Was not the coast of Lancashire almost as near to the Isle of Man, which, according to Orosius, was possessed by Scottish tribes, as any part of the conti∣nent of Caledonia was to Ireland? Why, in the name of wonder, was a bulwark of turf or stone a better security against the Irish Scots than against the Saxons of Friezeland or Holland, as both were transmarine nations with respect to the

Province? Why did the Irish, with a peculiar absurdity, land always on the wrong side of the Roman walls, which they must have scaled or destroyed before they could penetrate into the province? It is impossible to believe that all their ex∣peditions could have been so ill-concerted; and this consideration alone is sufficient to demonstrate that the Scots, whom the Roman writers so often mention, were inhabitants of Caledonia. Walls were constructed and legions employed to de∣fend the province from their incursions, but fleets were never fitted out to intercept or destroy them at sea.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">examined,</NOTE> On this etymon of Hibernia great weight is laid by the abettors of the Can∣tabric descent of the Irish.

Ireland itself, from a parity of reason, ought to have a name resembling that of Britain, which lies so near it, rather than from Iberia, divided from it by an immense ocean.

But no argument can arise in favour of their su∣perior antiquity from that priority. A colony of the ancient Grecians possessed themselves of a district of the lesser Asia, which afterwards obtained the name of Ionia. That colony, and their ancestors in Greece for a series of ages, were called Ionians, but their territories in Europe never possessed the appellation of Ionia; and, from that circumstance, will any man conclude, that the Ionians of Ephe∣sus and Miletus were more ancient than those of Attica?</P>

Gildas was remarkably fond of expressing himself in the language of poetry. His diction from so puerile an affectation partakes more of the turgid declamation of tragedy, than of the pre∣cision and simplicity of a grave historian.

from them in an age of ignorance, cre∣dulity, and barbarism. Bede, on the other hand, entertained a friendly partiali∣ty for the Scots of Ireland. That people were, in his time, remarkable for mon∣kish learning and ascetic austerities; which, together with their benevolence and hospitality to the Saxon students, who flocked into their country, recom∣mended them, in a very high degree, to the venerable Anglo-Saxon<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Bed.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">He received his accounts of the Scots from Ire∣land.</NOTE> The sudden transition which Bede makes from the tale of Reuda to a pane∣gyric on Ireland, furnishes a strong pre∣sumption that he derived his information from that quarter.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">confuted.</NOTE> It is apparent from another circum∣stance, that Bede borrowed his account of the Scots from the Irish.

But we may venture to affirm that Usher, in this supposition, was very much misled. Rute or Reaidh in the old Scotch language signifies a ram. From the first of these synonimous words, the territory in the county of Antrim, from which it is pre∣tended, that the British Scots originally transmigrated, received the appellation of the <HI>Route,</HI> and from the second is to be deduced the name of Dalriada, literally the valley of the Ram.</P>

These names being communicated to the Ro∣mans by the Britons, or by Pictish pri∣soners, it was natural for them to latinize them into Ierna, Jouverna, or Hibernia. In common conversation, the western Highlands are called by those who speak the Galic language IAR, or the West; and when the Hebrides are comprehended in that division of Scotland, the Galic appellation of Iar-in has been always given to the whole. The district of Atregathel, or rather Iar-ghaël, so often mentioned in the annals of Ireland and Scotland, as the first possessions of the Hibernian colonies in Britain, carries in its name a demonstration of this position,
<PB N="136" REF="146"/>
as well as a decisive argument against the ancient system of the origin of the Scots. Iar-ghaël literally signifies the <HI>Western-Ghael,</HI> or the Scots, in opposition to the <HI>Eastern-Ghael,</HI> or the Picts, who posses∣sed the shore of the German ocean.</P>

The Irish lay under the same disadvantage of un∣friendly seasons; and their Island was simu∣larly situated. The historians and poets of the empire, and the geographers of Greece and Rome exaggerated, from ignorance or prejudice, the severity of the climate un∣der which both the Scottish nations lived.

The antiquaries of Scotland have quoted seve∣ral passages from Bede to refute the ob∣servation of the learned prelate. But had the remark been perfectly just, it is by no means conclusive in favour of the superior antiquity of the Hibernian Scots. Were there no Scots in Ireland prior to the seventh century? for then, for the first time, that country received the name of Scotia from Isidore and Lawrence of Canterbury. We may turn the primate's argument against his own system. Mar∣cellinus found the Scots in Britain a whole century before Orosius discovered them in Ireland; and, from a parity of reason, we might conclude that the British Scots

are more ancient than the Irish friends of the ingenious prelate.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">and an∣swered.</NOTE> The learned Usher is not more happy in the argument which he deduces from the appellation of Scotia Major given to Ireland in opposition to the Scotia Minor of Britain. Donald O'Neil<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>In O'Neil's letter to Pope Boniface.</BIBL></NOTE>, a petty king or chieftain of Ulster in the four∣teenth century, and a charter granted by the emperor Sigismund to a convent of Scots and Irish at Ratisbon, have made that distinction. But to a conclusion drawn in favour of the old system, from these circumstances, it may, from a parity of reason, be opposed, that the Hiber∣nians of the age of Ptolemy were origi∣nally Britons, and not Spaniards, because that geographer gave the name of the lesser Britain to Ireland. The inhabitants of Hellas, by a similar argument, ought to have derived their origin from the Italian Magna Grecia; that is, to speak the language of some of those who are most likely to oppose our system, that the Greeks who possessed themselves of a part of Italy were older than their ancestors in Greece.</P>

That part of their history, like the ex∣ploded Milesian tale, must rest entirely on the credit of their own domestic annals; but that no degree of faith ought to be given to those annals beyond the intro∣duction of letters, is a point which we have already very amply discussed. The authority of history having failed, it is natural to suppose that the adversaries of our system will have recourse to objections arising from reason.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">On the rise and progress</NOTE> Could ancient tradition, the belief of ages, the positive assertions of English antiquaries and Irish annalists, and the universal acquiescence of the historians of the British Scots be sufficient to establish the credit of the Hibernian descent of that nation, it must be confessed that it were idle to hope to reconcile the public

judgment to a new system so diametrically opposite to the old. But we have seen that tradition could not have extended to that period in which the transmigration of the Scots is placed, and therefore the belief of ages, which was founded upon that pretended tradition, was no more than a popular error. This error ren∣dered venerable by its antiquity, misled, to say no worse, the writers of the annals of Ireland, and deceived the historians of North Britain. The antiquaries of Eng∣land, it must be confessed, could not be influenced by the prejudices which led astray the writers of both the Scottish nations; but the former were under no temptation to contradict or expose a tra∣dition which was not disagreeable to them∣selves, though from a very different cause than that which rendered it so highly favoured in Scotland and Ireland.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">of the Hi∣berno-Scot∣tish fictions.</NOTE> It may not be improper, in this place, to inquire into the rise and progress of those traditionary fictions which have so much obscured the antiquities of the Scots of both the Isles. When the first dawn of learning rose among those barbarous tribes who had subverted the empire of the Romans, some scholars more profound than the rest, traced the antiquity of their respective nations to illustrious names recorded in ancient history. The Ro∣mans, Greeks, Spaniards, and other na∣tions
<PB N="144" REF="154"/>
who figured in old times were placed at the head of the pedigree of bar∣barians, who, but just emerging from illiterate obscurity, had lost all memory of their own origin. The impostures of the half-learned writers of the middle ages were received with avidity and great cre∣dulity by the English, French, Spaniards, Germans, Danes, and Swedes: a part of an infatuation so universal must have ex∣tended itself to the Scots of Ireland.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cause of the obscurity which in∣volves the ancient Irish.</NOTE> The letters which St. Patrick intro∣duced into that Island in the fifth age, were not employed in recording historical transactions for some centuries posterior to that period.

Miracles, visions, and those sacred persons who distinguished themselves in the work of conversion, employed the whole atten∣tion of the monks, at a time that the royal line of Heremon sat in the midst of obscurity and anarchy on the Irish throne. The antiquities of the nation being thus left in the hands of illiterate bards and senachies, assumed so monstrous a form, that the polishing they have received from succeeding writers has scarcely hitherto rendered them fit for the public eye.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aera of the Spanish fic∣tion.</NOTE> The fable of the Hibernian extraction of the British Scots seems to have been fabricated in Ireland long before the bards thought of bringing a colony from Spain into that country. Bede, in the seventh age, had received intelligence of the first of those stories from the Irish senachies, but his placing it in a period beyond the reach of tradition has thrown absolute discredit upon the whole. In the period between Bede and Nennius, who, for the first time, mentioned the Cantabric descent of the Scots of Ireland, some learned bard or monk discovered that Spain was called Iberia, and, upon the similarity between that name and Hibernia, built the whole fabric of the Milesian tale. To obviate all scepticism concerning a story which wore the face of improba∣bility, it became necessary for succeeding writers to give assurances to the world, that letters and polite arts were cultivated in Ireland no less than seventeen hundred years before its conversion to the christian faith by St. Patrick.</P>

The Scots of Albany entertained a very diffe∣rent idea of the Irish nation. Hibernian missionaries had converted the greatest part of the Scots from the errors of the Pagan

superstition; Columba was the great apostle of the Picts, and became after∣wards the tutelar saint of the united Ca∣ledonian kingdoms. Legions of monks and saints swarmed from Ireland into North Britain in those days of conversion and religious peregrination. It was na∣tural for an illiterate people, like the Bri∣tish Scots, to believe that a nation who produced these holy and very extraordi∣nary men was one of the most illustrious in the world. Whether the zealous missionaries, among other pious frauds, endeavoured to inculcate on their converts a belief of the stupendous antiquity of the Irish nation, and the Hibernian ex∣traction of the Scots, to promote the good cause of Christianity, by procuring to themselves a favourable reception in Albany, is very difficult to determine. That those apostles served in the double capacity of bards and teachers of the faith is apparent from the appellation of CHLERI<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Chleri, from Clericus.</BIBL></NOTE>, given, in the old poems and traditions of the Scots, indiscriminately to the Irish emigrants of both profes∣sions.</P>

who first converted the majority of the Picts and Scots to Christianity. It was convenient for the divine, that the bard should propagate a belief of the con∣nexion between the Scots of both the Isles; and the authority of the former could establish any doctrine in the minds of an ignorant, credulous, and superstitious people. The senachies were impudent, the bards formidable, and both were elo∣quent. If any scepticism remained a∣gainst their well-told tales, the missionaries destroyed it altogether by the weight of their sanctified character. This system, once established, was propagated, and became the traditional belief of after ages. The little progress that learning made in Scotland when its first histories were writ∣ten, could not enable the zealous abettors of its antiquities to overturn that system of the origin of the nation, which had been so long obtruded upon the world; and the Scottish writers who, in a much later period, distinguished themselves in critical inquiries into the history of their ancestors, were at more pains to adorn the fictions of their predecessors, than to expose their absurdities.</P>

Ptolemy, it must be confessed, knew nothing of the inhabitants of the northern Britain, under the name of Scots; he was equally a stranger to the Picts, Maeatae, and Atta∣cotti. But, if he has neglected to men∣tion the Scots of Britain, he has been equally unjust to those of Ireland; a circumstance very strange, if that country was, as Bede says, overstocked with tribes of that name before Caledonia received any colony from abroad.</P>

The Franks and Allemans were not heard of before the third century; yet those nations, in whom the Catti, Chauci, Cherusci, Agravarii, the Teutones, and the Cimbri, in a confined sense, were lost, were never once thought to have been a new people, who had enslaved, destroyed, or expelled, the old inhabitants of those territories which they possessed in Germany. These collateral examples form a complete answer to the objection against our system, which arises from the silence of the Romans concerning the Picts and Scots till the beginning of the fourth age.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Proofs of the Caledonian extraction of the Scots.</NOTE> To dwell no longer on negative ar∣guments against the Hibernian system, we shall proceed to positive proofs of the Caledonian extraction of the British Scots. The very ingenious author of some disser∣tations lately published, has discussed this subject with so much ability and exact∣ness, that little is left to be done but to collect into one point of view the most striking of his arguments. To these ar∣guments we shall annex some observations, to quash for ever a system which had been so long imposed for truth upon the world.</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="162"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">First proof.</NOTE> Alba or Albin, it has been already ob∣served, was the first name given to this island, by the Gaël, who transmigrated from Belgium into the more elevated country of Britain. Hence proceeded the Albion of the Greeks, and the Albium of the Roman language. The inhabitants of mountainous countries, who, from their situation, have very little intercourse with other nations, and who were never subject to a foreign yoke, are remarkably tenacious of the local names, and their aboriginal customs, manners, and language. We accordingly find, that the ancient Scots, in all the ages to which our information extends, agreed in calling Scotland Alba or Albania. The High∣landers and the inhabitants of the He∣brides have, to this day, no other name but Alba for Scotland, and they invaria∣bly call themselves Albanich, or genuine Britons. The uninterrupted use of this national appellation, from the earliest ac∣count we have of their history, furnishes a moral demonstration that they are the true descendants of the first inhabitants of Britain. Had they been of Irish extrac∣tion, they and their ancestors would have undoubtedly assumed a name more suitable to their origin.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Second proof.</NOTE> The Belgic nations, who transmigrated into South Britain before the descent of Julius Caesar, retained the name of those
<PB N="153" REF="163"/>
communities on the continent from which they respectively derived their blood<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Caesar, lib. v.</BIBL></NOTE>. The auxiliaries of Vortigern preserved long their original name of Saxons, and the Scots who speak the Galic language have no other name for England or its inhabitants than <HI>Sasson</HI> and <HI>Sassonich.</HI> But if the ancient Scots have preserved among them the true name of the English, for so many ages after it has been disused by that nation itself, it is much more likely that they must have retained their own in∣digenous name.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Third proof.</NOTE> Had the Scots been originally Irish, <HI>Erinich</HI> and not <HI>Albanich</HI> would have been their proper name. So far were they from adopting the name of their neigh∣bours of Hibernia, that it is well known that both the old Irish and the inhabitants of the north of Scotland promiscuously call themselves Gaël, or the posterity of the Gauls, who first transmigrated into Britain from the continent. The Welsh, in ancient times, distinguished the Scots of both the British Isles by the appellation of Gaidhel, which, as the DH are inva∣riably quiescent in Celtic words, is much the same with Gaël, in the pronuncia∣tion. Should then the Scots be of Irish extract, it must naturally follow that the
<PB N="154" REF="164"/>
Picts sprung from the same source, a doc∣trine no less absurd than it is new.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Fourth proof.</NOTE> From the name of the district of Iar-ghael, which, it has been always said, was the first territory possessed by the Hiberno-Scottish colony, there arises a very decisive argument in favour of our system. Iar-ghaël is not the name of the country, but of those who inhabited it from the earliest times. It signifies the <HI>Western-Gael</HI> in opposition to the <HI>Eastern-Gael,</HI> or the Picts, who possessed the shore of the German ocean. But what is con∣clusive against the Irish system is, that <HI>Caeldoch,</HI> or the country of the Gaël, which the Romans softened into Caledo∣nia, is the only name by which the Highlanders distinguished that division of Scotland which they themselves possess.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Gaël of the conti∣nent</NOTE> We shall now leave it to the candour of the unprejudiced, and the con mon sense of mankind, whether there does not, upon the whole, arise a demonstration, that the first colony of Gael or Gauls who transmigated into Britai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> from the continent, and were afterwards driven northward by the pressure of other inter∣lopers, are the progenitors of the Scots of North Britain and Ireland.

The name of Scotti was communicated to the Romans by the Picts and Britons. The Britons and Romans discovering a perfect resemblance in the manners, customs, dress, arms, and language of the Iar-ghaël, or western Caledonians, and the Irish, agreed to call both nations by one common name. The Irish being no strangers to the military reputation that their friends of Caledonia had acquired against the Romans and their provincials, either adopted their name, or acquiesced afterwards in an appellation which some writers had imposed upon them. The illiterate, and consequently the bulk of the Irish nation, were never reconciled to this innovation. They preserved the Ca∣ledonian designation of Gaël, or the name of Erinich, which they had assumed after their transmigration into Ireland, and the adventitious names of Scotti and Scottia fell at last into total desuetude,.</P>

In the course of the preceding discussi∣on, the Author of the Introduction has laid no stress upon the testimony of the Poems of Ossian. Having rejected the Hibernian bards, there might be an ap∣pearance of partiality in drawing autho∣rities from the ancient poet of Caledonia. In the present state of the argument, there is no need of his assistance. The fabric we have raised demands no collate∣ral prop; it even can bestow the aid it does not require. The perfect agreement between Ossian and the genealogical sys∣tem we have established, has placed his aera beyond the commencement of the po∣pular opinion of the Hibernian descent of the Scots; which was old enough to be placed in a period of remote antiquity by Bede, who flourished in the beginning of the seventh age.</P>

From this system of the univer∣sality of God, the Celtic nations natural∣ly deduced an idea, that his presence was most conspicuous in those parts of the universe which were endued with most beauty and action.

It is likely, therefore, that the veneration which the Celtae shewed, upon every occasion, for the Sun, Moon, Stars, Fire, great collections of water, and for Forests and Mountains, proceed∣ed originally from an opinion that these great objects were the best symbols of the Supreme Being<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">Eos (scilicet Barbaros) DINO in the Celtic lan∣guage TIEN or TIN signifies Fire) ait nymphodorus sub dio mactare existimantes ignem et aquam Deorum esse simulacra. <BIBL>Clem.

From this philoso∣phical system opinions arose among the bulk of the Celtae, which almost deviat∣ed into polytheism. As it was the busi∣ness of God to do every thing, so they thought that the chief wisdom of man should consist in penetrating into his de∣signs, and in endeavouring to avert such of his decisions as might be detrimental to themselves.

Grynaeus and Grannius are evidently derived from the Celtic GRIAN; which is composed of CRI, trembling; and TEIN, fire. In the oblique cases TEIN makes THEIN, which is pronounced EIN, or AN; the consonants which be∣gin the nominative of Celtic words being invariably quuescent in the genitive; so that CRI-EIN, or CRI-AN, literally signifies the <HI>trembling fire,</HI> in allusion to the sun's appearance to the eye.

evident remains of the superstitions of the Druidical system of religion. It was a custom, till of late years, among the in∣habitants of whole districts in the North of Scotland, to extinguish all their fires on the evening of the last day of April. Early on the first day of May some select persons met in a private place, and, by turning with great rapidity an augre in a dry piece of wood, extracted what they called the <HI>forced</HI> or <HI>elementary</HI> fire<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">TEIN-EGIN, or the forced fire. The practice of extracting the TEIN-EGIN is not yet altogether discon∣tinued among the ignorant vulgar.</NOTE>. Some active young men, one from each hamlet in the district, attended at a distance, and, as soon as the <HI>forced fire</HI> was kindled, carried part of it with great expedition and joy to their respective villages.

<P>These and many other extraordinary and superstitious ceremonies, used upon this occasion, have, it is certain, much of the appearance of religious worship paid by the ancient Caledonians to the Sun. The rude monuments which, as we have already observed, bear still the name of GRIAN-AIS, seem, at first sight, to put the certainty of the existence of polytheism among the Celtae beyond any dispute; but we may venture to affirm, that neither of those circumstances furnishes a conclusive argument upon that head.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Divinations, sacrifices, and in∣chantments.</NOTE> Though it was a fundamental maxim in the opinions of the Celtae concerning God, that he was the sole agent in all operations of nature, they were far from supposing that his decrees were predeter∣mined and unalterable. The first busi∣ness, therefore, as has been already ob∣served, was to penetrate into his designs by means of divination, and afterwards to endeavour to avert from themselves such of those designs as might be detrimental, by the assistance of sacrifice, prayers, and inchantment. The element of fire, and above all, the Sun, which is the source of it, were objects in which the soul of the world seemed most manifestly to ex∣ert itself; and consequently they, more than any other part of nature, employed the attention of a superstitious people: and this attention soon degenerated into those ridiculous ceremonies which we have just described. As such circular piles of stones as we have already men∣tioned are only to be met with on plains, we may conclude that they were only arti∣ficial eminences raised for the BEL-TEIN, in places where <HI>rocks,</HI> from which it ori∣ginally derived its name, could not be found.</P>

But if the intelligence who resided in the Sun, and who was pecu∣liarly honoured by an unmixed branch of the Celtae, could not, in their opinion, extricate his wings from the effects of a frosty evening, we may justly conclude, that the spirits placed in less dignified objects of nature, were actually what they were called, AISE, or feeble sha∣dows<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The Celtic AISE is the fountain from which we ought to derive the <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>dii</HI> and AESAR of the ancient Hetrurians, as well as the ANSES or ASES of the nor∣thern nations.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">General re∣flections.</NOTE> To collect into one point of view the opinion of the Celtic nations upon the subject of religion, they originally believ∣ed that the Supreme Divinity DE, as the soul of the world, pervaded the whole body of nature. This philosophical idea degenerated, among the bulk of the peo∣ple, into a supposition that some objects of nature, instead of being animated by God himself, became the residences of spirits, who, in subordination to him, di∣rected the operations of their respective portions of matter. To these intelligen∣ces they gave the name of AISE, or <HI>sha∣dowy ghosts,</HI> expressive of the vast dispro∣portion between them and that Being who was the source from which these spi∣rits themselves, as well as every thing possessed of life and motion, derived their existence. It is, upon the whole, highly probable, that the rites which some of the ancients took for sacrifices to subordinate Divinities among the Celtae, were no o∣ther than ceremonies used by those Bar∣barians for the purpose of their pretended divinations and inchantments.</P>

Whole nations have come down into the region of true history without having pla∣ced a tenet so essential to religion in their faith. The infancy of society is not favour∣able to speculative inquiry. Mankind, in their rudest state, scarce ever extend their ideas beyond objects of sense. They per∣ceive, when death suspends the functions of the body, that the man ceases to act and to feel; and the subsequent dissolution of his whole frame establishes the supposi∣tion, that his being is at an end. Nature herself confirms the opinion from every quarter by symptoms of decay. The oak

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Unknown in the first stage of society.</NOTE> Philosophy only begins where the first stage of society ends. As long as bodily labour is the only means of acquiring the necessaries of life, man has neither time or inclination to cultivate the mind. Spe∣culative inquiry is the first fruits of the leisure which civil life procures for indi∣viduals; but it is extremely doubtful whether the Immortality of the Soul is among the first truths which philosophers have rescued from ignorance and barba∣rity.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Aera of its being first broached in Greece.</NOTE> The most polished nation of antiquity was late in its reception of the doctrine of the Immortality of the Soul. The Greeks, till the days of Thales<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">Thales PRIMUS dixit animas esse immortales. <BIBL>Chaerilus Poeta.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>, had formed no idea at all concerning a future state.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Merely spe∣culative</NOTE> The Immortality of the Soul was, upon the whole, a doctrine merely specu∣lative among the ancient Greeks. Their Poets held it forth in their compositions; their philosophers inculcated it upon their disciples; it was a theme of disputation in the schools; but the bulk of the peo∣ple did not look upon it as a truth neces∣sary to religion: and it is even a matter of doubt whether those philosophers who affirm that virtue must be loved on its own account, did not, in that instance, forget what they had advanced in other places concerning the rewards which await the good in another life.</P>

It is a matter of great doubt with many, whether the Jews themselves admitted, in an early period, the Immortality of the Soul a∣mong the articles of their faith.

things unseen. He sighed over the narrow circle which surrounded his days. He often sat in silence beneath the sound of his groves; and he blamed the careless billows that rolled between him and the <HI>green Isle of the West</HI><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">Celebratae illae beatorum insulae dicuntur esse in occidentali oceano. <BIBL>Eustath. ad Dion.

<P>"One day, as the magician of SKERR sat thoughtful upon a rock, a storm arose on the sea: A cloud, under whose squally skirts the foaming waters complained, rushed suddenly into the bay; and from its dark womb at once issued forth a boat with its white sails bent to the wind, and hung round with a hundred moving oars: But it was destitute of mariners; itself seeming to live and move. An unusual terror seized the aged magician: He heard a voice though he saw no human form. <Q REND="inline">"Arise, behold the boat of the heroes—arise, and see the green Isle of those who have passed away<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Vid. Plutarch. de Orac. Defect.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>"He felt a strange force on his limbs: he saw no person; but he moved to the boat. The wind immediately changed. In the bosom of the cloud he sailed away. Seven days gleamed faintly round him; seven nights added their gloom to his darkness. His ears were stunned with shrill voices. The dull murmur of winds
<PB N="192" REF="202"/>
passed him on either side. He slept not; but his eyes were not heavy: he ate not, but he was not hungry. On the eighth day the waves swelled into mountains; the boat rocked violently from side to side. The darkness thickened around him, when a thousand voices at once cried aloud, <Q REND="inline">"The Isle, the Isle."</Q> The billows opened wide before him; the calm land of the departed rushed in light on his eyes<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There is a great similarity between this passage and the romantic description given by Procopius of those whose office it was to transport departed souls to the Celtic Paradise.—<Q REND="inline">Narrant indignae, se id habere munus, ut in orbem, sua quisque vice, deducunt animas.

<P>"It was not a light that dazzled, but a pure, distinguishing, and placid light, which called forth every object to view in their most perfect form. The Isle spread large before him like a pleasing dream of the soul; where distance fades not on the sight; where nearness fatigues not the eye. It had its gently-sloping hills of green; nor did they wholly want their clouds: But the clouds were bright and transparent; and each involved in its bosom the source of a stream; a beaute∣ous stream, which, wandering down the
<PB N="193" REF="203"/>
steep, was like the faint notes of the half∣touched harp to the distant ear. The valleys were open, and free to the ocean; trees loaded with leaves, which scarcely waved to the light breeze, were scattered on the green declivities and rising grounds. The rude winds walked not on the moon∣tain; no storm took its course through the sky. All was calm and bright; the pure sun of autumn shone from his blue sky on the fields. He hastened not to the West for repose; nor was he seen to rise from the East. He sits in his mid-day height, and looks obliquely on the Noble Isle."</P>
<P>"In each valley is its slow-moving stream. The pure waters swell over the banks, yet abstain from the fields. The showers disturb them not; nor are they lessened by the heat of the sun. On the rising hill are the halls of the departed—the high-roofed dwellings of the heroes of old."</P></Q></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">General re∣marks.</NOTE> Thus far is the Tale worthy of transla∣tion. Incoherent fables succeed the de∣scription; and the employments of the Blessed in their Fortunate Island differ, in no respect, from the amusements of the most uncultivated inhabitants of a moun∣tainous country. The bodies with which the bard clothes his departed heroes have more grace, and are more active, than
<PB N="194" REF="204"/>
those they left behind them in this world; and he describes with peculiar elegance the beauty of the women. After a very transient vision of the NOBLE ISLE, the magician of Skerr returned home in the same miraculous manner in which he had been carried across the ocean. But though in his own mind he comprehended his absence in sixteen days, he found every thing changed at his return. No trace of his habitation remained; he knew not the face of any man. He was even forced, says the Tale, to make inquiry concern∣ing himself; and tradition had scarcely carried down his name to the generation who then possessed the Island of SKERR. Two complete centuries had passed away since his departure; so imperceptible was the flight of time in the felicity of the Celtic Paradise.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The souls of the departed visited at times this world.</NOTE> The departed, according to the Tale, retained in the midst of their happiness a warm affection for their country and liv∣ing friends. They sometimes visited the first; and by the latter, as the bard ex∣presses it, they were transiently seen in the hour of peril, and especially on the near approach of death. It was then that at midnight the death-devoted, to use the words of the Tale, were sud∣denly awakened by a strange knocking at their gates; it was then that they heard

the undistinct voice of their departed friends calling them away to the Noble Isle<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">Intempesta nocte pulsari sores, seque, obscura vo∣ce, acciri audiunt. <BIBL>Procop.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cause of variety in the charac∣ters of na∣tions.</NOTE> THE principles of reason are so unchangeable in themselves, that were men to form their actions upon them there would be little diversity in the cha∣racter of nations. The speculative opi∣nions of the Brahmin on the banks of the Ganges differed not materially from those of the Druid on the Rhine; but there was no similarity between the igno∣rant Indian and the illiterate German.

<HEAD>Their Amusements and Diversions.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Amuse∣ments of the ancient Britons</NOTE> The British branch of the Celtae, like the great stock from which they sprung, were, almost in every thing, on the ex∣treme. They placed their chief happi∣ness in the most perfect inactivity, or in the most violent exertions of the body. Wedded to the strange opinion, that all labour, whether of body or mind, was mean and disgraceful, they dedicated the whole time that remained to them from war and the chace, to sleep, and a very few domestic diversions<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">Plus per otium transigunt, dediti somno. <BIBL>Tacit.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">consisted in feasts</NOTE> To feast together, and to regale them∣selves, held the first place in their amuse∣ments. Every slight occurrence was seized upon with eagerness, as an excuse for conviviality and public entertainment. Without the banquet nothing important was ever done. The feast was, as it were, the seal which gave validity to pub∣lic conventions, the sanction which ren∣dered inviolable private friendships. The name-day of every person in a family was kept, marriages were celebrated with un∣common festivity, and funerals solemnized with lavish hospitality. The love of a
<PB N="204" REF="214"/>
reputation for hospitality was carried so far, that the great men in the community often pitched tents and built huts on the public road, for the pleasure of enter∣taining indiscriminately all those who pas∣sed that way<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Athenaeus, lib. iv.</BIBL></NOTE>. These entertainments have been known to last a whole year; and the hospitable chief, not content with giving a general invitation to all the members of the state, placed parties of men on the by-roads of the country, to bring passengers, by a kind of compul∣sion, to his table.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">and public</NOTE> The dishes at those feasts were not nu∣merous, and there was little variety in the cookery.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of singing,</NOTE> The bards held a conspicuous place at public entertainments; and a great part of the amusement of our ancestors was derived from their songs. They repeat∣ed their compositions in every branch of poetry; the heroic, the elegiac, the ludi∣crous, the severe. The words were set to music; the bard recited nothing where the voice was not sustained by some in∣strument. The harp was appropriated
<PB N="207" REF="217"/>
to the serious; a flute or pipe accompa∣nied the comic and lively.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">dancing,</NOTE> That species of dancing which the Greeks distinguished by the name of Pyr∣rhic, was an universal amusement a∣mong the Celtic nations. A number of young men in complete armour rushed in suddenly before the guests, at a certain pe∣riod of the warlike music, danced with great agility, and kept time by striking their swords against their shields<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Xenophon. Exped. Cyr. lib. vi.</BIBL></NOTE>.

<HEAD>Their Morality and Poetry.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">General reflections.</NOTE> Vice is not natural to man; he derives it from those fictitious wants which grow with the progress of society. Before proper∣ty becomes the means of procuring sensual pleasure, civil restraints are superfluous, and morality itself an unnecessary study. The contempt which the Celtic nations shewed for death, is a proof that they were not anxious about the possession of the conveniencies of life; and that circum∣stance shut up the great channel of cor∣ruption which pollutes the human mind in an advanced stage of civility. We may here without impropriety observe, that the vices of Barbarians proceed from prejudice, and their virtues from na∣ture.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Morality taught by the Druids,</NOTE> The Druids, with their speculative opinions on religion, inculcated upon their followers some general maxims of mora∣lity. The result of their inquiries in other branches of philosophy, their dis∣coveries in the nature and properties of matter, they confined to themselves, to astonish into a veneration for their order a race of men whom they wished to govern through the channel of prejudice and igno∣rance.

Darkness was favourable to the continuance of their power; and they encouraged into a settled contempt that dislike to science and the arts of civil life which the northern nations derived from their natural aversion to mental, as well as to bodily labour.</P>

That elevation of soul which the first inspired was more favourable to virtue than the cold dictates of the latter; for the mind which entertains a conscious and dignified pride seldom harbours vice. The influence which the Bards derived from the instruction and amusement with which their poems furnished their countrymen, raised them to equal honours with the Druids themselves. The respect for their order was so great and universal, that armies engaged in action have been known to desist from battle when the Bards threw themselves between the lines<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline"><GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <BIBL>Diod.

The hymns of the FER-LAOI were lost by the introduction of a new religion; and the works of the SENACHY expired in their natural dulness. A few of the compositions of the FER-DAN have tri∣umphed over the ravages of time; and prove that the Bards inculcated the purest morals on their countrymen, and compre∣hended in their songs all those virtues which render a man truly great, and de∣servedly renowned.</P>

It at the same time shews, that the personal virtues of individuals avail little to perpe∣tuate the fame of an uncultivated nation; and it also proves, that no dignity of character, no greatness of soul, can res∣cue the prince from the oblivion which must involve his unpolished and illiterate people.

The ludicrous is local and temporary; and satire ceases to please when the follies it reprehends are lost in length of time. The sentimental is peculiar to no age; it suits the inherent feelings of the human mind; and when clothed with glowing imagery, and expressed in smooth versifi∣cation, it pleases the fancy, and adheres to the memory. It is to an union of all these circumstances we owe the preserva∣tion of the greatest part of the poems of Ossian, which contribute to finish the picture of our ancestors, of which the outlines have been drawn by the writers of Greece and Rome.</P>

Caesar, in speaking of the Germans, attributes their great stature to the gross food with which they were nourished, and to the continual exercise which was the natural attendant on the two occupations of hunting and depreda∣tory war. The illustrious writer ascribes it in part to the uninterrupted freedom of action they enjoyed in their youth; to the want of all application to study; and to the consequent absence of correction when boys<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">Non multum frumento, sed maximam partem lacte atque pecore vivunt, multumque <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>unt in venationibus, quae res et cibi genere, et quotidiana exercitatione et libertate vitae (quia a pueris, nullo officio aut disciplina assuefacti, nihil omnino contra voluntatem faciant,) et vires alit, et immani corporum magnitudine homines efficit. <BIBL>Caesar, lib. iv.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cause of that phaeno∣menon.</NOTE> These circumstances may have contri∣buted to the great size of the Celtic na∣tions, but they were far from being the only cause.

Among mankind, as in other animals, there seem to be a vari∣ety of species; some are by nature mere pigmies, others of gigantic proportions. No climate, no change of food can raise the Laplander to the height of the Ger∣man: and subject the latter for ages to the intense cold and scarcity of food in the arctic circle, and he will not dwindle into the mean stature of the present inha∣bitant of Lapland.</P>

Had the observation been just, the present English should exceed their fathers in stature; but this is so far from being the case, that they fall short of the modern Germans, and are scarce superior, in that respect, to the French, who, from possessing the grape, have for ages discontinued the drinking of beer. To strengthen the argument it may be here observed, that the inhabitants of London, who use beer the most, are of a smaller size than those who live less luxuriously in other parts of the kingdom. To solve the difficulty we must have recourse to a remark already made; that the Sarmatae, who, upon the decline of the Romans, advanced into the regions of the West, were a very different race of men from the Celtae, and that they sent down their low size, with their blood, to the present inhabitants of Eu∣rope, who are, in a great measure, their posterity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The general use of spirits, which has much pre∣vailed of late in Europe, may have contributed to lessen the size of the present race.

<DIV2 TYPE="subsection">
<HEAD>Reflections on the Origin of Go∣vernment.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rise and progress of society.</NOTE> SOCIETY is of greater antiquity than government. Civil regulations confess, in their own origin, the pre∣existence of public crimes. Mankind, like other animals, herded originally toge∣ther through mere instinct; and they de∣ceive themselves who think that commu∣ties were formed under a preconcerted system of policy. Man, in his rudest state, being destitute of property, neither fears nor meets with injustice: He pos∣sesses nothing which his own arm cannot defend, before the love of the convenien∣cies of life has overcome his neighbour's natural propensity to justice. In the progress of society individuals polish one another, as it were, by collision. The fruit of the ingenuity of one is adopted and improved by another: New inven∣tions start up in every quarter, and are
<PB N="243" REF="253"/>
lost in none: Luxury grows with the in∣crease of the arts of civil life, rapacity treads close on its heels; and then, for the first time, the check of law and re∣gulation becomes necessary to the welfare, if not to the very being of the community.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Origin of monarchy.</NOTE> The popular form of government is more ancient than monarchy. The patri∣archal authority from which some writers deduce the latter, is too much circum∣scribed in degree and time to be the foun∣tain from which monarchy flows. The power which a parent has over his chil∣dren cannot be transmitted to his son. He derives it from nature. and it dies with himself. Regal government is a civil institution, which in various coun∣tries owes its commencement to various causes. It generally takes its rise from a kind of usurpation; and, whatever theorists in politics may say, there were originally no stipulations made between the tyrant and the people. Length of time establishes into a kind of right what, at the beginning, was an act of injustice; and the acquiescence of the people con∣stitutes into a moral duty that obedience which was at first the effect of fear.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Popular go∣vernment older than monarchy.</NOTE> The simplicity of monarchical govern∣ment has established with many an opi∣nion of its superior antiquity. The in∣fancy of society, like that of man, must be awed, say they, into good behaviour by
<PB N="244" REF="254"/>
the fear of obvious punishment. The slow movements of popular governments command no respect, and impress no fears; and therefore men naturally place the power of the state where it can be exerted with most expedition and precision. They who argue in this manner are little ac∣quainted with the character of barbarous times. In the first stage of society there is no inequality between individuals: a man's mind must be opened with civili∣zation before he will acquiesce in an opi∣nion of his own inferiority. The Bar∣barian knows no person better than him∣self, and he submits to the dictates of none; deriving, in fact, from the vigour and independence of his own mind, that liberty which we owe to an accidental constitution of government.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Monarchy begins in force, and is supported by influ∣ence.</NOTE> Though monarchy, for the most part, begins in the midst of tumult and war, the very existence of regal power presup∣poses a considerable degree of civility in the community. The authority which the leader of a nation may acquire from personal merit in battle will die away in peace, unless the machine is kept in mo∣tion by the continued impulse of influ∣ence; and this influence, which is the foundation, if not the origin, of kingly government, is only to be obtained by having something to bestow upon abettors and dependents. A few being gained.
<PB N="245" REF="255"/>
through the channel of interest, the many are over-awed into submission; and that lenity and impartial justice, which pru∣dence dictates in the first periods of mo∣narchy, contributes to reconcile the minds of the people to the government of one.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Origin and nature of the popular form of go∣vernment.</NOTE> In the early infancy of a state, the only laws that subsist in the community are the opinions and prejudices of the people. Before property is well established, the catalogue of crimes is very succinct; and the punishments annexed to each are nei∣ther severe nor inflicted with precision. The people have not yet delegated their authority to a few; and the power that remains in the hands of the many seldom exerts itself with vigour. The society is kept together more by habit, and the ab∣sence of vice, than by any thing which deserves the name of government. The people, who have the whole power in their hands, convene only when they are to carry war into an enemy's country, or to defend their own. They consult together but on the external affairs of the community; its internal concerns are left to the opinions of individuals. This ab∣sence of all regulation may be called the most ancient form of government; and it may be distinguished by the title of a popular government, as the opinions of the people in general are the only checks upon the crimes and irregularities of in∣dividuals.</P>

Sic. de Britannis, lib. v.</BIBL></NOTE> which they enjoyed. Crimes, to use at once a paradox and a metaphor, are the parents of civil regulations; and necessity, which is said to have no law, is the source of all law.</P>

The stranger, the traveller, and the merchant, were secure in their persons and property, not by the severity of legal punishments, but from the natural propensity of the people to justice. Theft and robbery within the territory of the community were reckoned unpardonable crimes; be∣beyond the limits of the state they took the name of depredatory war, and were covered with honour and renown<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">Latrocinia nullam habent infamiam, quae extra fines cujusque civitatis fiunt. <BIBL>Caesar, lib. vi.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>.</P>

Though they did not, like the American Indians, excuse their cruelties by an aversion to war, for, on the contrary, it was the amuse∣ment and business of their lives, they fre∣quently

committed barbarities which can admit of little apology. To alleviate the weight of this reflection it ought to be observed, that the oppressions of the Ro∣mans, in the first period of their govern∣ment in Britain, were sufficient to raise a spirit of implacable revenge in minds less irascible and haughty than those of the ancient British nations. Neither were the Celtae, in any one of their branches, very tenacious of the faith of treaties; their fickle disposition, and ardent love of liberty, rendered them careless in their observation of conditions imposed upon them in their misfortunes<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">Gallica in foederibus inconstantia. <BIBL>Polyb. lib. ii.</BIBL></Q> <Q REND="inline">Foedifraga gens. <BIBL>Sid.

Ann. lib. xiii.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>. Their fidelity and at∣tachment to the foreign princes whom they served in war were without bounds, and beyond example. It must however be confessed, that gratitude for favours received had a greater influence upon their conduct in this respect, than a regard for the virtues of the person whose arms they bore. A Nero<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Sueton. Neron. xxxiv.</BIBL></NOTE>, a Vitellius, a Cara∣calla, were equally loved, and served with
<PB N="253" REF="263"/>
as much attachment as an Antonine, by the Celtic Germans; and the Britons, when they obeyed the Romans, made no distinction between a lawful prince and an usurper.—The ancient British na∣tions were equitable, just, open, and sin∣cere, in private life; in their public trans∣actions, like their Celtic neighbours on the continent, they were sometimes trea∣cherous and cruel.

<HEAD>General Observations.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Nations te∣nacious of original tongues.</NOTE> NATIONS are not so tenacious of their customs and manners as they are of their aboriginal tongues. The first may gradually vanish in the growing improvements of civil life; the latter can only be buried in the same grave with the people themselves. Conquest may con∣fine the bounds of a language; commerce may corrupt it; new inventions, by in∣troducing new words, may throw the old into disuse; a change in the mode of thinking may alter the idiom: but the ex∣tirpation of those who speak any ori∣nal tongue is the only means, by which it can be entirely destroyed, even where letters have been altogether un∣known. It retires from successful inva∣sion

into rocks and desarts; it subsists with the remains of a people; even moun∣tains and rivers in part retain it when the people are no more.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Latin not the mo∣ther of the language of France, &amp;c.</NOTE> That the Romans established their own language, in the regions of the West and North which submitted to their arms, is a position which the learned scarce ever doubted, and which the rest of the world still implicitly believe. The Latin has been considered as the fountain from which the Italian, French, and Spanish, derive their origin; and it must be con∣fessed, that, in a confined degree, the opinion is extremely just. It is however certain, that this mark of their own great∣ness, which the Romans seem to have left in the conquered provinces, proceeded more from the reputation of their litera∣ture than from the power of their arms. The illustrious nation had too much sense to endeavour to impose their own language upon the conquered; and, had they even departed from their usual political prudence on that head, it is scarcely credible, that they could have succeeded in the attempt. All other conquering nations, to whom history extends its information, failed in their endeavours of the same kind. The victors have often adopted the tongue of the vanquished; but the vassals have scarce ever been known to drop their own language for that of their lords.</P>
<P><PB N="257" REF="267"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">proved from collateral examples.</NOTE> The Arabs who conquered Persia, the Persians who subdued India, the Tartars who extended their empire over China, the Turks who reign in Greece and its Isles, have not been able to establish their own language in their conquests. The servants of the court, the attendants of the prince, the posterity of the victors, in general, may retain the tongue of their original country; but the bulk of the peo∣ple will also retain that which descended to them from their fathers. The Ro∣mans themselves could never extend the Latin to the Provinces of the East; on the contrary, the language of their Greek vassals prevailed, at last, over their own. The obstinate despotism of William the Conqueror, and the perseverance of those Norman and French princes who succeed∣ed him in the throne of England, could not force the language of France on the English nation; and the Lombards and Franks lost their own Sarmatic dialect in the tongues of Italy and Gaul. The cause is as obvious as the fact is true. The number of the conquerors bore no proportion to the vanquished; and, in the article of language, the majority al∣ways prevails.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cause of the connection of the French, &amp;c. with the Latin.</NOTE> The connection between the Latin and the languages of Spain, France, and mo∣dern Italy, must be traced to another source than the government of Rome.
<PB N="258" REF="268"/>
The nations who inhabited those exten∣sive regions originally, and whose poste∣rity still, in a great degree, possess them, were, in fact, the same people with the Romans. Those Gaël, who in Italy went under the name of Umbri, were partly the ancestors of the Banditti who settled with Romulus on the banks of the Tiber. The Romans, in their own a∣version to commerce, vindicate, in part, their Celtic origin against their pretended descent from the Greeks of Magna Grae∣cia, who were in some measure a commer∣cial people. Some of their own wri∣ters join issue with us in this opinion. Their language, though tinctured with Hellenisms, is radically different from the Greek; and we shall, in a subsequent section, have occasion to shew, that the primitives of the Latin tongue differ not materially from the language of a branch of the Celtae, to whom neither the litera∣ture nor the government of Rome ever extended themselves.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Celtic once the universal language in Europe.</NOTE> A similarity in the language of different nations is, of itself, sufficient to establish the certainty of their common origin, Were all the historical monuments of the English and Germans, by some accident, lost, the identity of the radical words common to the language of both, would convince mankind that one of those nati∣ons must have originally migrated from

the other. When the Romans threw the first light on the immense track of coun∣try which they distinguished by the name of Celtica, the same language as well as the same manners prevailed over the whole. The Aestiones, who inhabited Prussia and the banks of the Vistula, spoke nearly the same dialect with the ancient British nations<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">Dextero Suevici maris litore Aestiorum gentes alu∣untur: quibus ritus habitus Suevorum, lingua Britan∣nicae proprior. <BIBL>Tacit.

From

the pillars of Hercules to the mouth of the Danube, from the Hellespont almost to the Baltic, one language though in a great variety of dialects, prevailed; and, from that circumstance, should no other proof be produced, we may conclude, that all the nations who possessed that im∣mense extent of country sprung originally from one and the same source.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Latin descended from it in part.</NOTE> It is more natural to suppose that the Latin owes, in part, its origin to one of the dialects of the great and general tongue which pervaded ancient Europe, than that it was formed by a few vaga∣bonds who assembled together, for self∣defence, on the shores of the Tiber. Some visionary pedants have been known to attempt the creation of a new language; illiterate men have always contented themselves with that which has been transmitted to them by their ancestors. In the progress of society, in the growth of inventions, a language is polished in its phrases, and enriched in the number of its words; but its first rude elements remain in its primitives, and serve to point out the fountain from which it originally flowed.</P>

<HEAD>The Language of Ancient Britain.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">General re∣flections.</NOTE> Time, which effectuates a change in every thing, has a peculiar influence on language. In the less polished periods of society it grows gradually with advancing civilization; and, like those who speak it, it becomes corrupted through improve∣ment. When literature and philosophy arrive at their height, for even these, like all human inventions, have their bounds, men of genius, as it were, arrest language in its progress, and secure, by their writ∣ings, its permanency to future ages. They put their seals upon it, and send it down to posterity in a kind of independence on accident. Before the establishment of li∣terature, or where it is imperfectly known, language, having no standard by which it can be fixed, fluctuates with the chang∣ing manners of the society; and the longer it runs down through time, it departs the further from its primitive simplicity.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cause of di∣versity of dialects.</NOTE> To this circumstance, and not to a difference of origin, we must ascribe that diversity of dialects which Julius Caesar found in Gaul. The Aquitani<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline"><GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <BIBL>Strabo, lib. iv.</BIBL></Q></NOTE> were

not understood by the Belgae, nor could the Celt, at the foot of the Alps, hold any conversation with the Gaul at the mouths of the Rhine; yet no writer has ever af∣firmed that all Gaul was not possessed by one and the same people, though di∣vided into separate states. The truth is, the identity of languages does not consist in their being mutually understood by the nations who speak them, but in the simi∣larity discernible between the names of things which are common to all countries, and to every stage of society<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Strabo says, that the nations of Gaul differed very little from one another in point of language <Q REND="inline"><GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <BIBL>Strabo, lib. iv.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Three in Britain at the arrival of the Ro∣mans.</NOTE> We have, in a preceding section, ob∣served that Gaul and the lower Germany had sent colonies into Britain, at three different periods, before the arival of the Romans in the Island. The posterity of these must have differed considerably from one another in point of language. The Gaël, who still exist in North-Britain and Ireland, passed from the continent before
<PB N="263" REF="273"/>
the arts of civil life had made any great progress in Gaul; and, in some measure, retain the unimproved language of their ancestors. The second colony were the posterity of those Gauls, who, being an∣ciently settled beyond the Rhine, returned into the regions of the South, under the name of Cimbri. The Cumri of Wales are their descendants; and they preserve in their tongue, a tincture of the Sarma∣tic of the East and North. The British Belgae spoke that dialect of the language of Gaul which still subsists among their posterity in lower Britanny. The three dialects which we have just mentioned, have been thought by many learned wri∣ters to be the only genuine remains of the ancient Celtic; and others have added to these the language of the mountaineers of Asturias and Gallicia. Some have even gone so far as to affirm that these four languages are reciprocally understood by the Scots, Irish, and Welsh, the inhabi∣tants of Britany, and the Spaniards who border on the Bay of Biscay.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Observati∣ons on the Biscayan, Armorican, Welsh, &amp;c.</NOTE> The opinion is not just: The Biscayan has not even the most distant connection with the Celtic; the other languages de∣rive, it is certain, their origin from one source: they agree in many radical words, but their idioms are different. The Welshman is as ignorant of the Gaëlic as the Spaniard of Arragon is of the dia∣lect
<PB N="264" REF="274"/>
of Dauphiny; and the Scot knows no more of the language of Britany, than the inhabitant of Palermo does of the tongue of Portugal.—In vain have the learned had recourse to the rude dia∣lects of the Celtic, which remain in Bri∣tanny and Wales, to form upon them some idea of that language. What they sought after with so much eagerness a∣broad, was every day in their hands at home. The language of the Romans sprung originally in part from the Celtic stock; and the French, Italians, and Spaniards speak, in some measure, to this day, the tongue of their Celtic ancestors. To render the first part of the position pro∣bable, is to prove the latter beyond the power of reply.</P>

When the Greeks, from their possession of the arts which they had re∣ceived from Phoenicia and Egypt, began to multiply their numbers in Peloponnesus and the Islands of the Archipelago, they sent abroad colonies who settled on the shore of the lower Italy, and carried on some commerce in its ports. Out of the vagabonds of these two very different sets of men Romulus collected the founders of Rome. The mixed manners, and the mixed language of the Romans, prove their double origin, and furnish a kind of demonstration that the illustrious nation derived their blood from the Celtae, as well as from the Greeks of Magna Grae∣cia<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">Veresimile barbarici etiam generis reliquias nonnullas e vicinis et priscis incolis cum Graecis se conjunxisse. <BIBL>Dionys.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A remark.</NOTE> This catalogue might be extended to a much greater length, but nothing can be more tedious and unentertaining than a dry list of words. To remove every ground of supposition that the Scots of either of the British Isles borrowed any part of their language from the Latin it is necessary to observe, that almost every one word in the Gaëlic column is either a compound or derivative from some well known primitive in that language. The Gaëlic primitives are all monosyllables. Wherever a word of more syllables than one presents itself it is a compound; and all the adjectives are formed, by the ad∣dition of some termination or other, to a substantive noun.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Reflections</NOTE> To draw, in this place, a parallel be∣tween the Gaëlic, the Welch, and the language of Britanny, would not even have novelty to recommend it. The ingenious Mr. Lhud's comparative vocabulary is already in the hands of the curious; and to such as are not fond of philological dis∣quisition it is sufficient to observe, that the three languages, though not recipro∣cally understood by the Scots, Welch, and the inhabitants of Britanny, are evi∣dently descended from that tongue which
<PB N="272" REF="282"/>
the nations of Gaul carried in their mi∣grations to every quarter of Europe. It is even demonstrable, were not the sub∣ject foreign to this Introduction, that the Italian, Spanish, and especially the mo∣dern French, owe their origin, to speak in a confined sense, more to the ancient Celtic than to the Latin, which was itself, in part, a dialect of that language.</P>

<HEAD>Preliminary Observations.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Obscurity of the remote antiquities of the Sax∣ons.</NOTE> THE remote antiquities of the Saxons lie buried in the darkness which involved, in ancient times, the inhabitants of the northern Europe. Without the means of transmitting any account of themselves to posterity; at a distance from those nations who possessed the use of letters, their transactions were either lost in obscurity or disfigured with fable. In their progress towards the South, they gradually rose, as it were, from night; the light of history broke in upon them; and we see them, for the first time, in that rude form which a fierce combination of Barbarians wear in migra∣tion and depredatory war. After the soil and climate of Britain had attached them to fixed abodes, their natural ferocity was
<PB N="274" REF="284"/>
mellowed down by degrees; the arts of civil life began to appear; and they were among the first of the European nations who committed their history to writing, and even whose transactions were worthy of being recorded.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Apology and design</NOTE> The character, private life, and govern∣ment of the Anglo-Saxons, after their settlement in this island, furnish an am∣ple field for disquisition; the monuments which remain of their history on the continent are few in number; and the subject itself is, in some measure, barren, from its high antiquity. But as nothing that concerns a people who have made so great and splendid a figure can be unin∣teresting, either to themselves or the world, the Author of the Introduction hopes to screen his own want of abilities behind the importance of his subject. He even presumes to think that he has thrown some additional light on those an∣tiquities which he has endeavoured to re∣present in their least forbidding form. Should his confining himself to the his∣tory and manners of the Saxons in their rudest state be the chief objection to his work, he may perhaps remove it by de∣scending hereafter into a more fruitful period: should the objection, on the other hand, arise from any defect in himself, he will derive some happiness from the
<PB N="275" REF="285"/>
thoughts of having spent but little time, in a province where he failed to please.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">of the Author,</NOTE> To investigate the origin of the Anglo-Saxons, to pursue their progress from Scandinavia with precision, it may not be improper to throw together some reflec∣tions on the fall of the Romans; the de∣cline of whose power opened the regions of the West to the migrations of the Barbarians of the northern Europe.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="subsection">
<HEAD>Reflections on the Fall of the Romans.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cause of the stability of the Ro∣man empire,</NOTE> The Romans differed not more from other nations in the rise and progress, than in the extent and permanence of their power. The fall of the republic, by melting down into one mass all distinc∣tions of party, gave stability and weight to the state, when it destroyed the im∣portance of the members of which it was composed. Feeble and corrupted in the center, the empire threw all its vigour and strength into its frontier, and became formidable abroad in the midst of domestic decay. The disputes about the purple, though frequent and bloody, were but partial shocks; they agitated and disturb∣ed, but did neither break nor ruin the great fabric of the state. The storms were violent, but they did not last long;
<PB N="276" REF="286"/>
and things were soon restored to their original balance by the tranquility of ab∣solute government.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">In what dif∣ferent from other mo∣narchies.</NOTE> The despotic empires of Asia raised by the abilities of one prince fall through the weakness of another: the fate of the state is involved with the life of the mo∣narch, and when he dies in battle, or by the hands of the assassin, the great body, of which he was the head, submits to a foreign conqueror, or separates into petty principalities under domestic tyrants. The imperial authority at Rome stood upon a more solid foundation. When the Julian family reduced the Roman re∣public into an empire for themselves, they did not change in appearance the ancient form of government. Though a new power started up in the state, all the old offices remained. Despotism had the de∣cency to cover oppression with a mask, and to execute its most rigorous plans through channels neither unknown nor formidable in the days of freedom. The power of the first Caesars consisted in influence; and an overawed and venal senate were the obvious instruments of their tyranny.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Why the permanency of the em∣pire</NOTE> The interference of the imperial au∣thority was confined to matters of state. The detail of inferior government, the course of justice between individuals re∣mained in the possession of ancient forms. The oppressions of the worst of the Caesars
<PB N="277" REF="287"/>
scarce ever extended beyond the walls of Rome; and the provinces which had lan∣guished under the exactions of republican praefects flourished under the lieutenants of a Caligula and a Nero. Though, vested with the sacredness of his tri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>uni∣tian authority, no laws could bind the emperor, the empire itself was governed, in fact, by a regular system of laws; and therefore, when the tyrant fell, the state was not involved in his ruin.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">did not de∣pend on the fate of the prince.</NOTE> There was one other cause which pre∣vented the permanence of the Empire from depending on the fate of the prince. The hereditary succession, which the Julian family endeavoured to establish, expired with Nero; and the suffrage of the army, confirmed by the approbation of a timid and complying senate, became the only necessary title to the throne. Men raised by accidental influence to the imperial dignity, though they inforced obedience, could command neither respect nor attachment from a people among whom they themselves had been so lately numbered as private persons. The mul∣titude, who are, in every age and nation, the great supporters of hereditary mo∣narchy, found no resting-place for their loyalty in the fluctuations of imperial succession; and they acquiesced, without reluctance, in the government of any ambitious leader, who had paved his way
<PB N="278" REF="288"/>
to the purple by private treachery or by open force.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The exten∣sion of the freedom of the city the first cause of decline.</NOTE> One of the best of those, who held the reins of government at Rome, has∣tened the dissolution of the empire more than the very worst of his predecessors. The first Antonine, by extending the freedom of the city to<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dion Cassius says, that this was the act of Ant. Cara∣calla, but other writers of credit affirm the contrary. It was only, perhaps, the freedom of Latium that was extended to the provinces by Antoninus Pius; that of the city by Caracalla.</NOTE> all the provinces, broke down the fence of distinction which, even in the midst of degeneracy, protected some small remains of the old Roman spi∣rit. When the exclusive privilege of ci∣tizens was no longer confined to Italy, the awe which the conquered nations had for the original seat of greatness gradually decayed. When, to be born within the walls of Rome no longer conferred any peculiar immunities, that mysterious tie, which bound the attachment of the citi∣zen himself to the residence of his an∣cestors, was broken; and the veneration once annexed to the Roman name became naturally feeble, when the name itself was diffused over half the world.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The absence of all spirit in the pro∣vinces.</NOTE> But this cause of dissolution was neither obvious in its commencement nor rapid in its progress. The total absence of all
<PB N="279" REF="289"/>
spirit in the provinces balanced, for some time, its decline in Italy. The debility which tyranny and luxury carried from Rome through all its dominions, even contributed, though the opinion is singu∣lar, to the permanency and stability of the empire. The conquered nations, by be∣ing deprived of their arms, applied them∣selves to those enervating arts, which, by administering to luxury, deprave when they polish the human mind. Timid and habituated to submission, they fell in love with the tranquillity of despotism; and in a kind of determination to conti∣nue slaves, they became indifferent about the title and virtues of their tyrant. The news of his accession was enough to e∣stablish the authority of any prince in the most distant regions of the empire; and many provinces were so dispirited and passive, that a military force was found altogether unnecessary to secure their obe∣dience. No attempt at independence could be made by such an inactive body. Men were either ignorant of the natural rights of their species, or meanly resigned them for the abject security of servitude.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The general debility spreading to the army.</NOTE> The infectious debility which had seized the other subjects of Rome, did not, for some centuries after the extinction of liberty, overwhelm its armies. Born in the more distant parts of the empire, and stationed on its frontier, the soldier
<PB N="280" REF="290"/>
was a stranger to those enervating vices which extinguish the martial spirit. When the legions followed an ambitious leader to Rome, a dismission from service was the common reward of their fidelity; and if they were depraved by licence, they were soon dissipated and lost in the ge∣neral imbecillity of the body of the peo∣ple. They were succeeded in the presi∣dial provinces by new levies of hardy and uncorrupted barbarians, who preserved an appearance of vigour in the extremi∣ties of the empire, after the center had exhibited every symptom of political de∣cay.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The remo∣val of the seat of go∣vernment.</NOTE> The impolitic vanity of Constantine, in removing the seat of empire to a new capital, gave a mortal blow to the Ro∣man state. The senate, whose conse∣quence and authority had declined with their virtue, were, in some measure, an∣nihilated by being transplanted to another place. The name, even the very walls of Rome, contained something within them which commanded obedience from the provinces. The opinion which sup∣ports all government was destroyed, by turning the attention of the people to a quarter to which they were not accus∣tomed to look. They were habituated to obey implicitly the mandates of Ro∣man emperors and Roman senates; but to Bizantine princes and assemblies they
<PB N="281" REF="291"/>
paid only that cold and unwilling obe∣dience which force extorts from slaves. To complete at once the ruin of that mighty fabric which the policy and vir∣tue of ancient Rome had raised, Constan∣tine, by creating new offices and by changing the names of many of the old, altered the constitution of the Roman government This prince, in short, who covered with splendid exploits, in public life, the meanness and even wickedness of his private character, was more fatal to the permanancy of the Roman power, especially in the West, than the most wretched and impolitic of his predecessors in the imperial dignity.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">gives a mor∣tal blow to the empire.</NOTE> Julian, though endued with all the spi∣rit, abilities, and even virtues of the old Romans, came too late into the world to stop the rapid progress of the state to its decline. His untimely death extinguish∣ed the last hopes of Rome. The vigour and prudence with which he conducted his measures in his early youth serve only to shew what he might have been in his riper years. Had he lived, there was a chance for the future permanency of the empire, a certainty of its temporary greatness. He fell, and the whole fabric of Roman power nodded to its fall when he died. The circumscribed abilities of some of his successors supported, for a few years, a part of the venerable ruin; but
<PB N="282" REF="292"/>
with every rude blast that rushed from the North and East some shattered frag∣ment fell. Province was cut off after province, till the mutilated body at last expired, when Rome itself was taken and sacked by the Goths.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="subsection">
<HEAD>General Reflections on the Sarmatae.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Bar∣barians who were the secondary cause of the fall of Rome.</NOTE> The bad policy of Constantine and the imbecillity which gradually arose from advanced civility and slavery, though they were the great, were not the only, cause of the ruin of Rome. The Barbarians of the North and East, who have even pervaded the regions of Asia itself with their migrations, gave the finishing blow to a state already tottering to its fall. Wandering like beasts of prey on the skirts of their own deserts, they saw the luxuries which prevailed within the Ro∣man pale, and they made many attempts to break into the fold. Whilst vigour and discipline remained among the legions on the frontiers, they repelled with ease the irregular incursions of the naked Tar∣tars of the North and East. But after the general effeminacy had extended itself to the army, enemies who, in the better days of Rome, were despised, became formidable and victorious. The fence being once broken down, the deluge soon
<PB N="283" REF="293"/>
spread over the provinces of the West; and that great fabric which was the work of many centuries, fell in less than the space of one.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The obscu∣rity in which they were invol∣ved.</NOTE> It were in vain to attempt to penetrate the darkness which involved, at home, the Sarmatae, who succeeded the Romans in the regions of the West. Destitute of means of conveying their own annals to posterity, the first feeble light of history was thrown upon them when they shewed themselves, in a hostile manner, on the frontiers of the empire. The writers who have sent down the earliest ac∣count of their invasions, astonished at their appearance, and alarmed at their cru∣elties, seem to have been more anxious to describe what they then were, than what they had formerly been. They pushed not their inquiry into the origin of Bar∣barians whose ravages conveyed the first news of their name; and they were little solicitous about examining into the previous history of a rude race of men, whose in∣cursions into the Roman territories were perhaps their first public transaction. To supply, in some measure, this defect in the latter writers of Rome, we must return to antiquity, and recapitulate some part of what has been already advanced concern∣ing the state of Ancient Europe.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Europe pos∣sessed origi∣nally by the Celtae and Sarmatae:</NOTE> When the Greeks and Romans had ex∣tended their inquiries beyond the Danube and the Alps, they found, in the vast

To the inhabi∣tants of the regions of the East and North-East of the Danube they gave the name of Sarmatae; the Celtae extended them∣selves to the West and the ocean. The character of the Sarmatae, and their man∣ner of life, was as opposite to those of the Celtae as the barbarism common to both could permit.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">The ances∣tors of the Barbarians who over∣turned the empire.</NOTE> The enemies with whom the Romans contended in the decline of their empire were far from being the same race of men who opposed them when they first pene∣trated with their arms beyond the Alps. The whole dominions of the Celtae, ex∣cepting a part of Germany, the northern Britain, and Ireland, fell under the power of Rome during its political vigour. The Sarmatae of Scandinavia, with that fondness for migration which they exhi∣bited in all ages, advanced gradually into Germany, and, being stopt in their pro∣gress by the legions stationed on the Rhine and Danube, settled between the Baltic, the ocean, and the two great rivers just mentioned, and rose into various petty nations, whose manners bore evident marks of their mixed origin. The blood of the Sarmatae seems however to have most prevailed; for the language and character which the Barbarians who overturned the empire carried with them into the South of Europe were much more nearly allied to the Sarmatic Tar∣tars of the East than to the Celtic nations who possessed the West. The writers therefore who affirm, that the present lan∣guage of Germany is the remains of the old Celtic, deceive themselves and the public. The truth is, the modern Ger∣mans are almost as little concerned in those barbarous tribes, whom Tacitus so

They seem to have been in possession of that part of the shore of the Baltic which extends from the Vekel to the Drave.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Concluding reflection.</NOTE> To enter into the character and man∣ners of the Saxons, in this place, would pre-occupy a province which we have re∣served for another occasion. Before their arrival in Britain we have only transient and interrupted glimpses of their history through the obscurity in which their pro∣gress towards the South was involved. Their chief virtue was a ferocious bravery; their sole occupation was war. They certainly performed great actions, but they themselves were unacquainted with the means of transmitting them to posteri∣ty; and their fame being left in the hands of their enemies, came down through time mutilated and incomplete.</P>
