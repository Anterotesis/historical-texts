<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear Son,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>DO not let the news that I am going to communi∣cate afflict you too much. I wish I could conceal it from you, but I cannot. Your father is dan∣gerously ill, and without a miracle in his favour we must lose him. O heavens! my heart is ready to burst when I think of his affliction. For these six days I have not closed my eyes, and am now so weak that I can scarcely hold my pen. You must come home immediately. The servant who delivers you this letter, will return with you. Your father desires earnestly to see you. "Mau∣rice, my dear Maurice, if I could embrace him before I die!" he has repeated a hundred times in the day. Would to heaven that you were here now! However, do not lose a moment in packing up your things; and I have ordered the man to make all possible expedition. Every moment will be an age of anxiety to me, until I clasp you in my arms. Adieu, my dear child! may the Lord protect you from all dangers on your journey! I wait your return with the most lively impatience, and am</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Cousin,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I have now no other friend but you to apply to, and from you alone I can hope for comfort in a misfortune too weighty for me to bear. Heaven has deprived me of
<PB N="2" REF="6"/>what was dearest to me on earth, my beloved husband. You know how sincere and tender an affection I bore him. This day se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nnight he desired me to send for our son from school. When Maurice was brought up to his Bed, he stretched out his hand to him, and had scarcely given him his blessing, before he expired. With him is gone all the satisfaction and happiness of my life. You see me now plunged into a situation the most distressful and afflicting to a woman, and a mother. Yet if I suf∣fered alone, I could bear it; but my poor son sighs by my side. He is not yet sensible of the misfortune of being an orphan. It wounds my heart to see him look up to me with tears in his eyes, while he presses my hand, and speaks of his father. None but a mother can have an idea of so afflicting a sight. I think at those times that I read in his looks these melancholy words: "It is you alone, my dear mother, that must maintain me now." Wherever I go, he is at my side, and wipes the tears from his little eyes with my gown. Sorrow stops my voice when I would comfort him, for the very sight of my child renews all my afflictions. How shall I maintain him? My poor husband has left me nothing, and my hands are too feeble to work. To whom then shall I look for assistance, unless to you? On you alone I rest all my hopes. Heaven, I doubt not, will dispose your heart to relieve a destitute and forlorn widow, and to prove that the ties of blood which unite us are sacred. I give up my son to your care. Whatever kindness you shew to him, I shall receive as performed for my sake, and for the memory of a man who loved you. All the strength and spirits that I have left I will exert, to gain myself a livelihood by working; but to bring up my son properly is beyond my power. I give him up therefore to you en∣tirely. However seve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e it may be to part with my child, I must yield to necessity. In the mean time I comfort myself in the reflexion, that I rely on the favour of a merciful God, and the kindness of a worthy relation. Be you to him as a father, and enable him one day to soften my afflictions. I am unable to proceed. My tears, which wet my paper, shew you sufficiently what my heart feels. You have it in your power to determine my hap∣piness, and the well-being of my son. God will for ever
<PB N="5" REF="7"/>bless your liberality; he will reward you even in this world for your kindness to two unfortunate relations. I am, dear cousin,</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Yours of the 7th inst. in which you inform me of your husband's death, has given me the sincerest affliction. You may be assured, I partake of your grief, and feel still more for your loss than for my own. Yet I must confess, I cannot help being a good deal surprized that you think of applying to me alone for assistance. Is it absolutely necessary that your son should have the educa∣tion of a scholar, and add another to the number of half∣learned smatterers that are already in the world? Are there not many other professions in which he may render as great services to society, and labour to more advantage for his own interest? Consider with yourself, how without fortune or friends will he be able to advance himself? You know the world too well, to make it necessary for me to shew you that such an attempt would be impracticable. On the other hand, it would be unpleasing to yourself to see him chargeable to strangers. You speak of the ties of blood; but my own family, which is very nu∣merous, puts me more forcibly in mind of them; and I beg you to believe that it is with great difficulty I can maintain them in a suitable manner. To load myself with an additional burthen, is absolutely out of my power; and I am convinced, that upon more mature re∣flexion, you will dispense with my doing so. All that I can do is to put your son apprentice to a mercer at Ro∣chester, a Mr. Durant, with whom I have concerns in business. I promise you, he shall be well treated there. You may send him upon trial for some time: and if ap∣proved, he will take him without a fee. Consider ma∣turely of my offer, and let me know your determination, and your son's. If he resolves to go to the University, it is absolutely out of my power to maintain him there. I
<PB N="4" REF="8"/>request you to accept the enclosed order for four guineas, as a proof of my concern for your present distressed situa∣ation, and to believe me,</P>

<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I cannot forget the care that you and Mrs. Masters took of me while at your academy, though I have at present scarcely strength to write you these lines of acknowledge∣ment. But my mama, who sits by me crying, is un∣able through grief to take pen in hand, and has said that task on me who am so unfit for it. However, from re∣membering your constant kindness to me, I find some sa∣tisfaction in writing to you, though I may succeed but indifferently. You are already informed, I suppose, of my papa's death. Ah! sir, what you foretold me is not come to pass. You bid me not to be uneasy; that I should perhaps, when I came home, find my papa out of danger. But, alas! he is dead. My mama is now a poor widow, and I an orphan. I dreaded no less, as I came near our house. I had fallen asleep in the chaise, and dreamed that my papa was in heaven; and that he took me by the hand, and spoke to me. At this I awoke, and in waking, seemed to hear the passing-bell toll. Yet we were not near the house, and had more than three miles to go yet. At last, when I arrived, my mama was at our door, waiting for me, all in tears. She kissed me, and took me up stairs to my papa who was in bed and almost speechless. When I kissed him, oh dear! how I cried and sobbed. At this he opened his eyes, and seeing me, laid his hand upon my head, and gave me his blessing; but in so faint a voice as scarcely to be heard. Ah! you cannot imagine how my mama and I cried. All his neighbours and acquaintance were in tears, too, at his funeral; but mama and I more than any body. I begin to eat and drink a little, but my mama has absolutely taken no nourishment, so that she is as pale as death; and I beg of her continually not to die, for then I do not know what would become of me in this world. Ah! dear sir, you may imagine how great a trouble it is to mama and me, that I am not able to continue my
<PB N="5" REF="9"/>education. But it cannot be otherwise, and I must be content. My mama has written to her cousin in London, who is a rich merchant, to request him to maintain me at school; but he will not, and he says that I shall be no better than a half-learned smatterer. For my part, I think, I might have learning enough if my mother had the tenth part of his money. But no; I must go apprentice to Mr. Durant the mercer, at Rochester. I cannot tell you how much that grieves me. Mama strives to comfort me, and tells me that it is a reputable line of business, and that I may make a fortune by fol∣lowing it with application. But what does all this signify, when one dislikes it? You know, dear sir, that learning was all to me: I wished to be as good a scholar and di∣vine as my papa. Before, I had always a book in my hand; now I shall be employed measuring silks with a yard. But I must hold my tongue, since it cannot be otherwise. Dear sir, I wish you happiness, and shall al∣ways think of you. I hope, too, that you will not for∣get me, and thank you again for your kind treatment of me. I suppose Mr. Durant will seldom take me to Lon∣don, so that as I pass there in my way to Rochester, I shall go and see you and Mrs. Masters; and if ever I come into great business, you shall take whatever you please in my shop, without paying a farthing. Only try. You shall see. Meantime I am, and ever shall be,</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maurice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! my poor mama is widow to a clergy∣man of Oxford. My papa is dead these two months. He was too charitable to the poor to leave much money be∣hind him. He kept me at school for three years near London; but I was sent home a little before he died, be∣cause he wished to see me once more. And as it was not in mama's power to continue my education, a kins∣man of hers sent me to be apprentice to Mr. Durant the mercer. I am with him upon trial. But if my relation that is so rich had thought proper, I should have gone to the University and taken my degrees. Ah! I should have been happy to follow my studies, and to become one day a great scholar. I was always the foremost in my class, and my masters were very fond of me. The next time that your ladyship shall have occasion for any thing from us, I will shew you a letter from our head master, which I received a week ago. You will see by it how fond
<PB N="9" REF="13"/>he was of me. Ay, and he says, he will be fond of me as long as he lives.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Abber.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not doubt it, my good child. You have already made me very fond of you, though this is the first time that ever I have seen you. But tell me; would you be glad to go from behind the counter, and return to school?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maurice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! if that was possible. But my mama cannot do it; she has not money enough, and schooling is expensive.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Abber.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; but if your mother has not, there are many people in the world that have more than enough. What would you say if I were to send you to a gentle∣man who should examine you, to see if you have made good use of the time that you have spent at school, and are likely to make a progress if you should return thither?</P>
</SP>

He seems, however, to have a strong desire for learning; therefore I beg as a favour that you will have the goodness to examine him, and if you form any hopes of him, I shall charge myself with his education. This being my birth day, puts me in mind of the duty to which we are born, that of doing good to our fellow∣creatures; and this child seems to have been sent by hea∣ven to be the object of it. I request you to give me your opinion of him, and am, sir, &amp;c.</P>

<P>He is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of fine passages, and especially of beautiful <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Only I with that Achille, had not been so passionate and stubborn.</P>

<P>What instances of passion or stubbornness do you find in him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maurice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Was it well done of him to leave the Greeks in distress? Was it their fault if he quarrelled with Aga∣memnon? They had done <HI>him</HI> no wrong. Should not he have suffered himself to be persunded, when the deputies came to make submission to him in his tent? But no, he
<PB N="11" REF="15"/>remains immoveable as a rock. I should not have let them entreat me so long. I should have followed them at the first word.</P>

<P>We should be so towards all men, and espe∣cially to our countrymen. Oh! you have a Sophocles too. The tragedy of Philoctetes, I believe, is by him. I have read it in English. It is a very moving play. But I'll tell you, sir, what I liked best in it.</P>

<P>Yes, yes; Neoptolemus. It is when he∣comes back and brings Philoctetes his bow and arrows. I think that I should have done the same. But I beg pardon, sir; perhaps my talk grows tiresome to you.</P>

<P>Why not?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maurice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because he was an odious character. I do not know how the Greeks and Romans could be such fools as to worship him. He was quite a libertine, and always quarrelling with Juno. Is that acting like a god?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>The Master.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are right. He was an improper and contemptible object of worship. However, nothing has been handed down to us concerning him but the imagi∣nations of the vulgar; and you know that the people has always been blind and superstitious.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maurice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why our peasants now-a-days have more sense. Only imagine, sir, the clergyman of a parish going into the pulpit, and preaching that God almighty has a wife, whom he deceives and scolds every day. His parishioners would not believe a word of it.</P>

<P>How comes it that the vulgar are now more sensible than in former times?</P>

<P>From the light of the gospel. There every thing shews a just and good God. If I had lived in Greece, and had possessed such a book, they would never have worshipped any other than the God that we worship.</P>

<P>I thank you a thousand times for your kindness in taking notice of me and in writing to Lady Abberville. I should be very happy to return to my former school, where every body loves me; but since you will be the occasion of my happiness, I shall be glad to enjoy it un∣der your eye. If I am so lucky as to be admitted into your academy, I will love you with all my heart. I hope, I shall be diligent and well behaved, and learn every thing that you will be kind enough to teach me. I hardly dare

But if I remain with Mr. Du∣rant, you will not refuse me the pleasure of coming to see you now and then, and of discoursing a little with you and reading your fine books; otherwise I shall soon forget all that I have learned at school, and I should be sorry for that, although it be not much.

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Mama,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Joy! joy! you are now free from all trouble, and I too. Do not, however, let tears of joy hinder you from reading my letter. This is the story of my happiness. Mr. Durant sent me this morning to carry some sattin to Lady Abberville. Oh! an excellent lady! Ah! if you were here now! but do you know, mama, that you are
<PB N="16" REF="20"/>to be here before a week? she will give you an apartment in her house, and you will live with her, and I shall go to school, and shall come to see you whenever you chuse. Oh! that will be a happiness; such a happiness! you remember, for all that, how you cried when I was leaving you. You said that you kissed me, perhaps, for the last time. I hope now, you will never have that to fear again. My mama is to send you money for the journey, for she is as much my mama as you are, and I am very sure that you will not be angry at that. All the money, however, that you receive in this parcel is not from her; there are twelve shillings from me. She gave them to me, and I send them to you. Make haste to get every thing in rea∣diness for your journey hither; the sooner you come the happier we shall be. I have spoken so well of you to the lady that she wishes to see you almost as much as I do. Set out, set out: I shall watch the coming of every stage, to tell you the whole story before you see her, though I suppose she tells it to you herself in the letter that she writes to you to-day. I have not time to add more, for I should be afraid that my letter would be too late if I wrote all that I have to say.</P>

<HEAD>THE PARRICIDE.</HEAD>
<P>WHAT dreadful weather! I perish with cold and have no shelter against the bitter winds, no bed to warm my benumbed limbs. I am old and my strength is exhausted by labour. Unnatural son! The thought of you tears my heart. Unnatural son! I gave you life; I nourished you and took care of your weak and sickly in∣fancy. When I saw you suffer through illness, my tears fell upon your cheeks. You loved me at that time and would say, while you caressed me, "Papa, what makes you cry? I am not sick now; do not be troubled; see I am quite well." You raised yourself up in your bed; your little hands would play in my hair, and you would say again, "Do not grieve any more; I am cured." And as you spoke the words, you would fall down again through weakness. You would strive to speak, but could not. At last, however, your body grew strong; you be∣came hale and robust, and you should have been the prop of my old age. I laboured all my life for you, and now you shut me out of your house in the midst of wind and snow. "We cannot live together any longer, father," said you to me in your fury. And why not, my son? What have I done to you? I have exhorted you to virtue; that is all my crime. When I saw you spend in debauchery the earnings of sixty years labour, the fortune of which I willingly stripped myself to enrich you, I pointed out your danger to you. God is my witness that I was more anxious on your account than on my own. Was I not silent long enough, for fear of troubling you? But my silence and my sorrow, which I strove to hide, made no impression on you. I was then obliged to speak. I thought it my duty then to resume the prerogative of a father; yet my authority was tempered with mildness. My discourse was as tender as it was earnest. I spoke to you of your mother who died through grief on account of your disorderly life! I spoke to you of myself, whom the same cause would probably send to my grave. I shewed you my aged cheeks almost worn with the tears that you have made me shed. I shewed you my grey hairs which stood on end through anguish and sorrow. I opened
<PB N="18" REF="22"/>my arms to you, to invite you to my bosom. I should have fallen on my knees to you, if your father, even in that humble posture, could have softened you. And you, my son—I can scarcely believe it yet—you advanced towards me with a threatening air: your arm was stretch∣ed out, and your gate shut against me. You my son? You are no longer so. Why do my bowels still feel the yearnings of a father towards you? I am tempted to wish that I could curse you: but no I dare not breathe forth even my complaints aloud. I fear left heaven should hear them, and left this house, which you have shut against me, should fall upon your door. I will lay myself down on the stone before your door. To-morrow you cannot come out without seeing me, and I hardly think that your heart will not soften when you see what I shall have suf∣fered during this dreadful night. But if the severity of the season, if my exhausted old age, and still more, the sorrows that wound my heart, should occasion my death, then shudder at thy crime; weep for me, and for yourself still more. Ah! I should think my death a fortunate cir∣cumstance, if it could produce your reformation.</P>
<P>Such were the complaints of this old man. But the north wind all the live-long night carried away his sighs unheard. The tempest filled the air with dreadful whist∣lings; the shattered trees of the forest were bent down; and all nature seemed to shudder with horror at the crime of his son. The next morning the old man was found dead upon the stone. He had his-hands clasped together, and his face turned towards heaven. The name of his son was the last word that he had pronounced. He had prayed to the very last moment for the parricide.</P>

<HEAD>JONATHAN.</HEAD>
<P>JONATHAN, a gardener of Lincoln, was looked upon as the most skilful in the county. His fruits sur∣passed those of his neighbours in bigness, and were always found to have an exquisite flavour. All the first gentlemen round about were ambitious of having his peaches at their deserts, so that he had no occasion to send his melons to
<PB N="19" REF="23"/>the market; they were bespoke on the beds, and very often could not be had for gold. The reputation that he obtained, and the profits that he drew from his labours, increased his assiduity in the cultivation of his garden. Rich and industrious as he was, he easily found a proper match, and espoused Claribell, a young woman in the neighbourhood, as prudent as she was handsome. The first year of their marriage was very happy. Claribell as∣sisted her husband in his labours, and the fruits of their garden were more prosperous than ever.</P>
<P>Unhappily for Jonathan, near his house there lived another gardener, called Guzzle, who at day break fixed himself in an alehouse, which he seldom left before night. Jonathan was delighted with Guzzle's hearty humour, and was not long before he fell into the same taste. At first, he went now and then to meet him at the alehouse, and only talked to him of gardening; but very soon, in his own garden, he talked to him of nothing but strong beer. Claribell grieved at the change in her husband's behaviour. As she had not as yet sufficiedt experience herself to undertake the care of the wall-trees, she was frequently obliged to bring him home to his work, and usually found him amongst his pots and glasses. Alas! it would often have been better for him to stay from the garden. His head was now generally muddled with beer when he went to work upon his trees, and his pruning∣knife cut away at random amongst the branches: those that bore were cut, as well as those that did not; and the fine peach trees, on which last year there had not been<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> single bough unfruitful, did now only stretch their lazy arms, like so many yawning idlers. The more Jonathan found his garden decay, the more fond he grew of this sottish way of life. His fruit and his vegetables had lost their great name, and not being able by his earnings to satisfy his fondness for drink, he parted by degrees with his furniture, his linen, and his clothes. At length one day, when his wife was gone to market with some roots that she had reared herself, he went and sold all his garden utensils, in order to drink the money with Guzzle. It would be difficult to describe Claribell's grief at her re∣turn. To be reduced from a moderate competency to the most destitute poverty was not the height of her misfor∣tune. She felt still more strongly for the fate of her hus∣band,
<PB N="20" REF="24"/>and of a young infant, six months old, which she had then at the breast. Who should suppose that this child was to save the whole family from destruction?</P>
<P>The evening of the same day, Jonathan came home swearing, threw himself into a chair, and leaning on his elbow over the table, surlily asked his wife for something to eat. Claribell handed him a large case-knife, and a basket that was covered with her apron. Jonathan snatched the apron off; but what was his surprize, to see his own child fast asleep in the basket. "Eat there, said Claribell to him; it is all that I have left to give you. You are the Father of this child, and if you do not devour him, famine and misery shortly will." Jonathan, thunderstruck at these words, remained speechless, with his eyes stu∣pidly fixed upon his son. At length his sorrow broke out in tears and exclamations. He rises, and embracing his wife, asks her pardon and promises to reform; and he kept his word.</P>
<P>His father in law, who for some time had refused to see him, being informed of his good intentions, advanced him a sum to enable him to put his garden in order again. Jonathan made good use of this supply, and very soon his garden flourished as happily as ever. He became once more and continued even to his old age, active, in∣dustrious, a good husband and a good father. He took pleasure sometimes (though he blushed at the same time) in telling this story to his son, who, from his example, conceived such an aversion to drinking and idleness, that he was all his life as sober as he was laborious.</P>

<P>Why do you call that good-natured child a little fool?</P>

<P>Why, he knows nothing.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Mr. W.</SPEAKER>
<P>Of what you have learnt, I grant you; but then he knows many things which you do not, and you may both inform each other a good deal, if you will com∣municate what you know, one to the other.</P>

<SPEAKER>Val.</SPEAKER>
<P>He may learn a good deal of me, but what can I learn from him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. W.</SPEAKER>
<P>If ever you should have a farm, do you think that it would be of no service to you to have an early notion of the labours of the country, to learn to distinguish trees and plants, to know the times of sowing and harvest, and to study the wonders of vegetation? Michael possesses these different parts of knowledge, and desires no better than to share them with you. They will perhaps be one day of the greatest use to you. Those, on the contrary, that you could communicate, would be of no service to him. So that you see, in this intercourse, all the advan∣tage is on your side.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Val.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but papa, would it become me to learn any thing from a little country boy?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. W.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why not, if he is capable of instructing you? I know no real distinction amongst men, than that of useful talents and good manners; and you must own that in both these points, he has equally the advantage over you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Val.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, in good manners too?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. W.</SPEAKER>
<P>In every station, they consist in treating all per∣sons as our duty prescribes to us. He does so, in shewing a particular attachment and complaisance to you. Do you do the same? do you make a return of mildness and good will? And yet he seems to merit them. He is active and intelligent. I believe him to be possest of good-nature, spirit, and good sense. You ought to think
<PB N="23" REF="27"/>yourself very happy in having so amiable a companion with whom you may at once amuse and improve yourself. His father is my foster-brother, and has always had a re∣markable affection for me. I am pretty sure that Michael has the same for you. See how the poor little fellow hankers about the terrace-walk, to meet you. Take care and use him with civility. There is more honour and integrity in his father's cottage than in many palaces. His family too has been our tenants for some generations, and I should be glad to see the connexion continued be∣tween our children.

<P>What do you mean, my dear?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. W.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am just now convinced of what I only sus∣pected in the morning. The boy's head is filled with ex∣cessive vanity, and all his reading is but ostentation. He has only lost himself on purpose to make us look for him, and to appear absent and forgetful through intense study. It gives me more pain that his mind should wander from a right way of thinking than if his steps really went astray. He will be unhappy all his life if he is not cured of it in time, and there is nothing but a wholesome humi∣liation that can save him.</P>

<P>He will then better see the necessity of profiting by the lessons that I have given him upon this subject. Besides, we intend him for the army, and in that profes∣sion he will have many nights to pass without shelter. He will know now what it is, and not go to a camp quite raw, to be laughed at by his companions. Then the air is not very cold at this season of the year, and for one night he will not die with hunger. Since by his folly he has brought himself into a scrape, let him get out of it again, or suffer the disagreeable consequences of it.</P>

<P>So I am, mama.</P>

<P>At what, my dear? I thought to see you come back quite in spirits after your walk.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Viola.</SPEAKER>
<P>My walk was pleasant at first; but in coming home, as I passed before our carpenter's house, I saw his three children sitting at the door, and crying most piteously. They were starving with hunger.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Stan.</SPEAKER>
<P>How can that be? Their father has a good trade, and it is not a week since I paid him three guineas for work done about our house.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Viola.</SPEAKER>
<P>So my governess told a woman, one of the neigh∣bours, that came up to comfort the children and gave them some bread.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Stan.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what did she say?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Viola.</SPEAKER>
<P>This poor man, said she, is much to be pitied. He works night and day, and is never the richer; his wife manages so ill. She knows nothing of housewifery. She can neither sew, nor spin, nor knit; and cannot even get up the family's linen. If her husband wants a clean shirt, he must have it washed and mended out of the house.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Stan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sad management indeed! and I do not wonder that you were grieved at finding a woman who does not perform any single duty of her sex. I wish she may be the only one of that sort that you will ever meet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Viola.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! mama, this is not all. As she can do nothing for her family, nothing in the world, idleness has led her to drinking. When her husband, after work∣ing hard, thinks to have a good meal ready for him at his return home, he finds his wife stretched upon the bed,
<PB N="34" REF="38"/>intoxicated; and very often his children have not a bit of bread to eat the whole day. Don't you think those poor children much to be pitied?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Stan.</SPEAKER>
<P>I pity them as well as you, my dear; but on this disagreeable occasion, you had an opportunity of making a remark that may be serviceable to you all your life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Viola.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is that, mama?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Stan.</SPEAKER>
<P>That a woman who neglects the employ∣ments of her sex and condition, is the most contemptible and unhappy creature in the world. You may now per∣ceive the reason why your papa and I constantly advise you to be doing something.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Viola.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! yes, mama; I see now how much you love me when you instruct me in my work. But pray tell me, have young ladies of fortune and quality any occasion to learn so many things? When they are mar∣ried, have not they waiting women to do for them what∣ever they want?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Stan.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear Viola, work is as absolutely neces∣sary for them as for the children of the poor. Not to mention the reverses of fortune that may one day deprive a woman of every means of subsistence, except the labour of her own hands: and yet these reverses are common enough. But in the highest rank of life, amidst a crowd of servants ready at her call, should not she herself know something of what work is, in order to employ each one properly in his several way, not to require of them more than they can perform, to be able to recompense their diligence by making their service easy, and thus to gain their attachment and respect. Obliged by her rank and her wealth to employ a great number of tradesmen, how will she be able, without knowing what work is herself, to set the proper value upon that of others, by neither cutting short the fair demand of a useful tradesman, nor yielding to the impositions of the vender of luxuries and fashionable toys; and thus on the one hand indulge a ge∣nerosity suitable to her birth, and on the other guard against a useless expence<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Besides, what a pleasure for a sensible woman to see herself and her children clothed in the work of her own hands, and to employ the savings of such oeconomy in relieving the sick and indigent, and
<PB N="35" REF="39"/>bringing up their children, so that they may in proper time maintain their parents?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Viola.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! pray don't let us lose a moment. Teach me all that, mama.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Stan.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will, my dear; that I may, by so doing, both perform my own duty, and assist you to follow the dictates of nature and religion; but particularly that I may save you from that dangerous dissipation which a habit of idleness may render agreeable and even neces∣sary. I will do it in order to make domestic retirement not unpleasing to you; in order to make you yourself amiable in the eyes of your husband, and respectable in those of your children; in order to procure you hereafter a relief and amusement that may divert your attention from the evils of life, which might otherwise affect you too forcibly; and in fine, to insure to you the tranquil∣lity of a good conscience, and to render you happy every moment of your life. You have seen, by the example of the carpenter's wife, to what odious vices idleness may lead us. But what think you of that vapourish unhappy listlessness, the most insupportable torment to a woman? I can give you, perhaps, a slight idea of it, and propor∣tioned to your understanding, in the story of a little girl of your own age.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Viola.</SPEAKER>
<P>O dear, mama! make haste; let us have the little girl's story.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Stan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then here it is. "Mrs. Friendly was always happy in being employed, and never passed a quarter of an hour otherwise the whole day. Angelica, her daughter, could hardly believe her when she talked to her of the satisfaction arising from industry, and the disagreeable effects of doing nothing. It is true, she worked whenever her mother bid her, for she was accustomed to obey; but one may easily imagine how unhappy she was at her work, as she never began it but with reluctance. My dear child, Mrs. Friendly would often say to her, when she saw her at work with her head hanging down, and her hands in a careless posture, I wish you may soon feel the tiresome languor that arises from having nothing to do, and the satisfaction that one enjoys in being mo∣derately employed. This wish, inspired by her affection, was not long unaccomplished. Angelica, then about eleven years old, was to go one day with her mother to a coun∣try-house
<PB N="36" REF="40"/>many miles off. Mrs. Friendly, at her depar∣ture, took her work-bag with her, and strongly recom∣mended it to Angelica not to forget hers. Angelica was willing to obey; but how easily does one lose sight of a duty that is performed with reluctance! The work∣bag was forgot. Their journey at first was quite agree∣able. The weather was fine, and all nature seemed to smile. But about noon, the clouds thickened round the horizon, and the thunder rolled from one end of the sky to the other. Their fright obliged them to stop at a small town, where there was only one inn, and imme∣diately afterwards the rain came down in a flood. As the approaching storm had forced a number of travellers to seek shelter in the inn, Mrs. Friendly and her daugh∣ter could not find a single room in it disengaged. She therefore ordered the horses to be unharnessed, and alighted at the house of a good old woman close by, who very civilly resigned them her bed-chamber and her bed, the only one that she had. How happy was Mrs. Friendly that she had brought her work. The good old woman sat beside her, spinning at her wheel, and between work and conversation the long summer's afternoon passed away without seeming tedious to them. Poor Angelica was not very happy in the mean time. The cottage was small, and after she had visited every corner of it, she had then absolutely nothing left to do. The rain, which still fell in great abundance, did not allow her to set her foot out of doors; the terrible noise of the thunder left her no desire for sleep, and the conversation of the old woman, who could talk of nothing but her work, was not very likely to amuse her. She begged her mama to let her have <HI>her</HI> work; but Mrs. Friendly told her very justly, that she would not deprive herself of amusement for her; that having taken care to bring with her some∣thing to employ herself, it was but fair that she should enjoy the fruits of her attention, and that she on the contrary should suffer for her negligence and forgetful∣ness. Angelica could say nothing to reasons so forcible. After many wearisome yawnings, sighs of impatience, and fruitless murmurs against the weather, Angelica at length got to the end of the evening. She eat a small supper without appetite, and went to bed much out of humour with her jaunt. How joyful did she rise at the
<PB N="37" REF="41"/>first summons of the sun who rose without a cloud! With what eagerness did she hasten her mother's departure! At last the carriage was ready; and Mrs. Friendly, hav∣ing generously rewarded the good old woman for her civility, set forward again as well satisfied with her man∣ner of passing the day before, as Angelica was discon∣tented with it. The roads had lately been much broken up, and the rain water which still covered them, hin∣dered the ruts from being observed. The chaise jolted out of one hole into another, the axle creaked, and the glasses rattled; at last a wheel broke down, and the car∣riage was overthrown. Happily Mrs. Friendly and her daughter received no hurt. They recovered from their fright by degrees, and perceiving at a distance a little hamlet upon the side of a hill, Mrs. Friendly took her daughter by the hand, and attended by her servant, walked towards the hamlet, intending to send assistance to her coachman. There was in this place neither smith nor wheelwright; so that they were obliged to wait al∣most two days for wheels from town, as Mrs. Friendly would travel in no other carriage but her own. Poor Angelica, how she cried! how she lamented the tedious∣ness of the time! The fright of her fall had made such an impression on her, as to deprive her of the use of her limbs; so that she could not enjoy even the amusement of walking. What could Mrs. Friendly do to make her time less heavy? The strict justice that she made a point of pursuing with her daughter, forbad her to resign her own work to her; besides, Angelica had so neglected her improvement in needle-work, that she <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ould have en∣tirely spoiled it. She then began to feel the value of em∣ploying one's self, and blushing with shame, said thus to her mother: Ah! mama, I have well deserved what has happened to me, and now for the first time see the rea∣son why you always advised me so strongly to work. I have sufficiently felt the wearisomeness of doing nothing. She then threw herself into her mother's arms, and hiding her face in her bosom, I beg pardon, mama, for griev∣ing you by my indolence. I saw that you were troubled to see me fret. But, for your sake and my own, I shall change my behaviour from this moment. Mrs. Friendly kissed her daughter, praised her resolution, and to strengthen the effect of Angelica's self-taught lesson,
<PB N="38" REF="42"/>shewed her how a taste for work hinders our time from hanging heavy, and softens the vexations of life, by di∣verting our thoughts from them in an agreeable and sa∣latary manner. She blessed the accidents of a journey that had wrought so happy a change in her daughter.</P>
<P>Angelica, on the other hand, kept her promise and even went beyond it; so that Mrs. Friendly never had reason to find fault with her afterwards, unless for too great application.</P>

<HEAD>THE YOUNG SPARROWS.</HEAD>
<P>LITTLE Robert one day perceived a sparrow's nest under the eaves of the house, and running imme∣diately for his sisters to inform them of his discovery, they all contrived together how to get the little covey into their possession. It was agreed to wait until the young ones should be fledged; that then Robert should raise a ladder against the wall, and that his sister should hold it fast below, while he climbed up for the nest. When they thought the little birds sufficiently feathered, they made ready to put their design in execution. It succeeded per∣fectly, and they found three young ones in the nest. The old birds sent forth piteous cries on seeing their little ones, whom they had nourished with so much care, taken from them; but Robert and his sisters were so overjoyed, that they did not pay the least attention to their complaints.</P>
<P>They were at first something puzzled what to do with their prisoners. Augusta, the youngest, being of a mild and compassionate disposition, was for having them put into a cage: she promised to take the charge of them upon herself, and to feed them regularly every day: she de∣scribed in a lively manner to her brother and sister, the pleasure that they should have in seeing and hearing those young birds when grown big. This was opposed by Ro∣bert: he maintained that it was better to pluck them just as they were, and that it would be much more <HI>funny</HI> to look at them jumping about in the room without feathers, than to see them dismally shut up in a cage. Charlotte, the eldest, declared herself of the same opinion as Augusta, but Robert persisted in his own.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="43"/>At last the two little girls, seeing that their brother would not give up the point, and that besides he had the nest in his possession, agreed to whatever he desired. But he had not waited for their consent to begin his execution. The first was already plucked. There is one stript, says he, setting it on the ground. In a moment all the little family were deprived of their tender feathers. The poor things cried, <HI>peep! peep!</HI> and complained very piteously; they shuddered with the cold, and shook their bare little wings. But Robert, instead of pitying their sufferings, did not end his persecutions there: he pushed them with his toe to make them go on, and whenever they tumbled over the burst out a laughing; and at last his sisters joined in the laugh with him.</P>
<P>While they were indulging this cruel amusement, they saw at a distance their tutor coming towards them. Mum! Each pocketed a bird, and was slinking off. "Well, cried their tutor to them, where are you going? Come hither!" This order obliged them to stop. They advanced slowly, with their eyes fixed on the ground.</P>

<SP>

<P>Pshaw! there are only a dozen.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rob.</SPEAKER>
<P>But that is too much.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>The Tutor.</SPEAKER>
<P>What would it be then, were one to pluck out all your hair so? Have you a notion of the pain that you would feel? And yet you have put these birds to the very same torture, though they never did you any harm. And you, young ladies, you that should be more tender-hearted, did you suffer this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<P>The two little misses were standing by silent, but hear∣ing these last words, and feeling the keenness of the rebuke, they sat down with their eyes swimming in tears. The tutor remarking their sorrow, was touched with it and said no more to them.</P>
<P>Robert did not cry, and endeavoured to justify himself thus: I could not think that I did them any harm. They sung all the while, and they clapped their wings as if they were pleased.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>The Tutor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you call their cries singing? But why should they sing?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rob.</SPEAKER>
<P>I suppose to call their father and mother.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>The Tutor.</SPEAKER>
<P>No doubt. And when their cries should have brought them, what did the young ones mean to tell them by clapping their wings?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rob.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot say exactly; perhaps to ask their help.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>The Tutor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Just so. Therefore, if those birds could have expressed themselves in our speech, you would have heard them cry, "Ah! father and mother, save us! We have unhappily fallen into the hands of cruel children who have plucked all our feathers. We are cold, and in pain. Come, warm us and cure us, or we shall die."</P>
<P>The little girls could hold out no longer; they sobbed and hid their faces in their handkerchiefs. It was you, Robert, that led us to this cruelty. We hated the thought of it ourselves. Robert was then himself sensible of his fault. He had already been punished by his tutor plucking his hair; he was now much more so by the re∣proaches of his own heart. The tutor thought there was no occasion to add to this double punishment. It was not, indeed, from an instinct of cruelty, but purely from want of thought, that Robert had done this ill-natured action, and the pity which he selt from that moment for all crea∣tures
<PB N="41" REF="45"/>weaker than himself, opened his heart to the senti∣ments of kindness and humanity that have animated him all the rest of his life.</P>

<HEAD>THE TWO APPLE-TREES.</HEAD>
<P>ARich husbandman had two sons, the one exactly a year older than the other. The very day the second was born, he had set in the entrance of his orchard two young apple-trees equal in size, which he had since cul∣tivated with the same care, and which had thriven so equally that nobody could give the preference to either of them before the other. When his children were ca∣pable of handling garden tools, he took them, one fine spring day, to see those two trees which he had planted for them, and called by their names; and after they had sufficiently admired their fine growth, and the number of blossoms that covered them, he said, "You see, chil∣dren, I give you these trees in good condition. They will thrive as much by your care as they will lose by your negligence, and their fruit will reward you in proportion to your labour."</P>
<P>The youngest, named Edmund, was indefatigable in his attention. He was all day busy in clearing his tree of insects that would have hurt it, and he propped up its stem, to hinder it from taking an ugly bent. He loosened the earth all round it, that the warmth of the sun and the moisture of the dews might cherish its roots. His mother had not tended him more carefully in his infancy than he did his young apple-tree.</P>
<P>His brother Moses did none of all this. He spent his time on a mount that was hard by, throwing stones from it at passengers in the road. He went amongst all the little country boys in the neighbourhood, to box with them, so that he was always seen with broken shins and black eyes, from the blows and kicks that he received in his quarrels. He neglected his tree so far, in short, that he never once thought of it, till one day in autumn he by chance saw Edmund's tree so full of apples, streaked with purple and gold, that were it not for the props which
<PB N="42" REF="46"/>supported its branches, the weight of its fruit must have bent it to the ground. Struck with the fight of so fine a growth, he ran to his own, hoping to find as large a crop on it; but what was his surprize, when he saw nothing but branches covered with moss, and a few yellow leaves! Quite angry and jealous, he went to his father, and said, "Father, what sort of a tree is this that you have given me? It is as dry as a broomstick, and I shall not have ten apples on it. But my brother!—Oh? you have used him better. Bid him at least share his apples with me."— "Share with you? said his father: so the industrious would lose his laber to feed the idle. Take what you get; it is the reward of your negligence, and do not think to accuse me of injustice, when you see your bro∣ther's rich crop. Your tree was as fruitful and in as good order as his. It bore as many blossoms, and grew in the same soil; only it had not the same usage. Edmund has kept his tree clear of even the smallest infects; you have suffered them to eat up yours in its blossom. As I do not chuse to let any thing which God has given me, and for which I hold myself accountable to him, go to ruin, I take this tree from you again, and call it no more by your name. It must pass through his hands to recover itself, and is his property from this moment, as well as the fruit that he shall make it bear. You may go and look for another in my nursery, and rear it, if you will, to make amends for your fault: but if you neglect it, that too shall belong to your brother, for assisting me in my labour."</P>
<P>Moses felt the justice of his father's sentence, and the wisdom of his design. He went that moment and chose in the nursery the most thriving young apple-tree that he could find. Edmund assisten him with his advice in rear∣ing it, and Moses did not lose a moment. He was never out of humour now with his comrades, and still less with himself, for he applied chearfully to work, and in autumn he saw his tree fully answer his hopes. Thus he had the double advantage of enriching himself with a plentiful growth of fruit, and at the same time of getting rid of the vicious habits that he had contracted.</P>
<P>His father was so well pleased with this change, that the following year he shared the produce of a small or∣chard between him and his brother.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! it is very true. I shall not think of it any more.</P>
<P>Just then a man stood up behind the hedge, whom they could not see before, because he had been sitting down on a grassy slope. It was an old man, the owner of the garden, who spoke thus to Frank: "Return thanks to God, my child, that your father hindered you from steal∣ing into my garden, and coming to take what does not belong to you. Know, that at the foot of each tree there is a trap laid to catch thieves, where you would certainly have been caught, and perhaps have lamed yourself for ever. But since, at the first word of the prudent lesson given you by your father, you have shewed a fear of God, and did no longer insist on the theft that you intended, I
<PB N="44" REF="48"/>will give you with pleasure some of the fruit that you wished to taste." At these words he went up to the finest pear-tree, shook it, and brought back his hat full of pears to Frank.</P>
<P>Mr. Ferguson would have taken money out of this purse to pay this civil old man, but could not prevail on him to accept any. "I have had a satisfaction, sir, in obliging your son, which I should lose were I to be paid for it. God alone repays such actions."</P>
<P>Mr. Ferguson shook hands with him over the hedge, and Frank thanked him too in a very manly manner; but he shewed a still more lively gratitude in the hearty appetite that he appeared to have for the pears which did indeed quite run over with juice. That is a very good man, said Frank to his papa, after he had finished the last, and they had got a good distance from the old man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Ferg.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, my dear; and he is so, no doubt, be∣cause his heart is convinced of this great truth, that God never fails to reward good actions, and chastise evil.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>Would God have punished me then, if I had taken the pears?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Ferg.</SPEAKER>
<P>The good old man told you what would have happened to you. God, my dear child, orders every thing that passes upon earth, and directs events so as to reward good people for their virtuous actions, and to pu∣nish the wicked for their crimes. I will tell you an ad∣venture which relates to this subject, and made so strong an impression on me, when a child, that I shall never for∣get it as long as I live.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! papa, how happy I am to-day; a pleasant walk, fine pears, and a story besides!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Ferg.</SPEAKER>
<P>When I was as little as you, and lived at my father's, we had two neighbours, the one on the right, the other on the left-hand of our house: their names were Dobson and Vicars. Mr. Dobson had a son called Simon, and Mr. Vicars one also of the name of Gamaliel. Behind our house and those of our neighbours were small gardens, separated at that time only by quick∣set hedges. Simon, when alone in his father's garden, amused himself with throwing stones into all the gardens round about, never once thinking that he might hurt somebody. Mr. Dobson had observed this, and repri∣manded him severely for it, threatening to chastise him if
<PB N="45" REF="49"/>ever he did so again. But unhappily this child knew not, or else did not believe, that one should not do amiss, even when alone, because God is always near us and sees whatever we do. One day, when his father was gone out, thinking that nobody could see him and therefore that he should not be punished, he filled his pocket with stones and began pelting them all round him. Just at the same time Mr. Vicars was in his garden with his son Gamaliel. This boy had the misfortune to think, as well as Simon, that it was enough not to do amiss before others, and that when alone one might do what one pleased. His father had a gun charged, to shoot the sparrows that came picking his cherries; and he was sit∣ting in a summer-house to watch them. At this moment, a servant came to tell him that a strange gentleman wanted him in the parlour: he therefore left the gun in the sum∣mer-house, and expressly forbid Gamaliel to touch it. But Gamaliel, when all alone, said to himself, "I dont see what harm there would be in playing with this gun a little;" and saying thus, he took it up and began to ex∣ercise with it like a soldier. He handled his arms and rested his firelock, and had a mind to try if he could make ready and present. The muzzle of his gun hap∣pened to be pointed towards Mr. Dobson's garden, and just as he was going to shut the left eye, in order to take aim, a pebble stone thrown by Simon struck him in that very eye. The fright and the pain together, made Ga∣maliel drop the gun, which went off; and, oh! what cries and shrieks were immediately heard in both gardens! Gamaliel had received a blow of a stone in the eye, and Simon received the whole charge of the gun in his leg. Thus the one lost his eye, and the other remained a cripple all the rest of his life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! poor Simon! poor Gamaliel! how I pity them!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Ferg.</SPEAKER>
<P>They were, it is true, very much to be pi∣tied; but their parents still more so, for having children so disobedient and vicious. After all it was a real hap∣piness for these two bad boys to have met with this acci∣dent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>How so, papa?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Ferg.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will tell you. If God had not early pu∣nished these children, they would always have continued
<PB N="46" REF="50"/>in mischief, whenever they found themselves alone; whereas they experienced by this warning, that whatever bad actions men do not see, God sees and punishes. This was therefore a lesson to them to amend themselves, and they became thenceforth prudent and sedate, and shunned doing mischief when alone, as much as if all the world saw them. And this indeed was the design of Providence in thus punishing them; for our merciful Creator never chastises us but to make us become better.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, that eye and leg will make me take care. I will shen what is wrong and do what is right, even though I see nobody near me.</P>
<P>As he had finished these words, they arrived at their own house-door.</P>

<P>Dear heart! Cicely, are you serious? Well, now I am as happy as I was dull a minute ago. But what hindered you to come?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cic.</SPEAKER>
<P>You know it was the first day of the month; and when my brother, at his landing, wrote to father from Portsmouth, he told him that he should hear from him again, without fail, as yesterday.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Isaac.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cic.</SPEAKER>
<P>So father would not wait for the postman, but sent me, about four o'clock, to the post-office, for the letter. They told me there, to wait; that it could not be long before the coach came in: so I staid, upon thorns. And father, uneasy at my stop, came soon afterwards; and before a quarter of an hour's end, comes mother too. You know I could not quit them. So there we staid until dark night, and no coach. I suppose some accident had happened. We came back sorrowful enough, and I could not leave father and mother grieving by themselves; now tell me, could I?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Isaac.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, you are very right. I shan't scold you. But what is your hurry now? Where do you want to go?</P>
</SP>

<P>To see if the letter is come yet. Father and mo∣ther are terribly uneasy. They are so fond of my brother, and he of them.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Isaac.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, I shall know it, I am afraid. He'll be ashamed now, mayhap, to see me one of his family, as I have no gold shoulder-knot, nor men at my command.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cic.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Isaac, do not make yourself uneasy. My father has lived in the same way of life with you these sixty years, and my brother has too much sense to despise it. He would have been the same as you, if he had not chanced to enlist when he was young. No, he will never look for a husband for his sister out of her own condition.</P>

<SPEAKER>Nanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>He is a soldier, my good man, and a soldier is not certain of his life a moment. That is what makes me unhappy. Very often, when his letters are rend to us, and you imagine that I cry for joy, it is for grief and sorrow. Each, I think, is perhaps his last: and this money that he sent us at his landing I cannot look at it without a heavy sigh. As I said to myself, it is his pay from the king, the price of his blood; and can we, his father and mother, be happy while we are spending it? Ah! I wish he were here now.</P>

<P>MR. Oakley having one day surprized his daughter Arabella very busy before her glass, they had the following conversation on the subject.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Oakley.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why Arabella, you are drest very fine. I suppose it is to receive or to pay visits.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arabella.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, papa, I am to spend the evening with the Miss Monktons.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Oakley.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thought you were going to figure in a circle of duchesses. What needs all this dressing for friends that you see every day?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arabella.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, papa, you know—when one goes out, one should not be in a dishabille as at home.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Oakley.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you are generally in dishabille at home?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arabella.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, papa;—but you know there ought to be a difference.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Oakley.</SPEAKER>
<P>I understand. You mean that you should be a little more attentive to your dress. But I thought, as I came in, that you seemed busy in examining your looks, and your figure. Does your glass tell you that your studies have succeeded?
<STAGE>(Arabella tooks down, and blushes.)</STAGE> What is your intention?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arabella.</SPEAKER>
<P>Papa, one always likes to please, and—we would not appear so as to frighten people.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Oakley.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha, ha! then it depends on our choice to please people, or to frighten them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arobella.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not entirely. But I meant—as others do when they say, one looks like a fright.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Oakley.</SPEAKER>
<P>I should like to know what that means. It may be of use to myself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arabella.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why for instance; when one is pitted deeply with the small-pox, or has a great long nose and chin, or a wide mouth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="65" REF="69"/>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Oakley.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thank heaven you have none of these; but rather, indeed, a sensible little countenance. What more do you want, in order to please universally, and not to be a fright?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arabella.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! I can't tell how it is, but I know some little misses that have very handsome faces, and yet they do not please me; and I know other that are not counted handsome, and yet I like their faces very much.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Oakley.</SPEAKER>
<P>Can you trust me with your thoughts? Tell me those first that are handsome and yet have not the good luck to please your taste.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arabella.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is easily done. In the first place, there is Miss Bloomer. She has a clear smooth skin, as white as a lily, with fine blue eyes and rosy lips. But she has an affected loll which makes her seem lower than she is; and she hangs her head on one shoulder, so that her face looks quite another thing. Then she draws out her words slowly, as if she weighed each syllable, and in speaking she looks at you, expecting you to admire every sentence. In the next place, there is the eldest Miss Archly; she passes for a beauty, but her looks are so proud and sneer∣ing, that when we are a number of us together, we can∣not help thinking she despises or ridicules us. As for Miss Drake, she carries herself with so much confidence, and speaks with such an air of command, that a boy would blush—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Oakley.</SPEAKER>
<P>Softly! At this rate we shall fall into scandal. I would rather hear you mention those who, without being handsome, have found means to please you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arabella.</SPEAKER>
<P>You know Miss Emily Johnson? She is much marked with the small-pox, and even has a pearl on her left eye from it; but yet her countenance is so pleasing, that one may read in it good-nature, mildness, and com∣plaisance. The youngest Miss Archly has the smallest cast in the world with her eyes, from having had some∣thing hung before one eye that was sore for almost a twelvemonth when she was young. She looks to the right, to see what is on her left hand. Well, it is no∣thing when one becomes used to it, and we all love her dearly; she is so lively, and so gay.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Oakley.</SPEAKER>
<P>You seen then, outward advantages, such as a fair soft skin, white teeth, a handsome nose, rosy lips, a fine easy shape, in short, all the beauties of face or
<PB N="66" REF="70"/>person, are not sufficient by themselves to make one please: one must have besides a happy countenance, and engaging manners.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arabella.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly, papa; for otherwise I cannot tell how some please me who are neither handsome nor well shaped, and how others are disagreeable with all these ad∣vantages.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Oakley.</SPEAKER>
<P>But can you tell why the first have some∣thing in their countenances more agreeable to us than the regular features of the second?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arabella.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because, I should think, one sees there some figns of their disposition; and we are apt to think that those who have an appearance of good-nature in the fea∣tures of the face, must have a good heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Oakley.</SPEAKER>
<P>When you were before your glass, you strove, no doubt, to throw a little good-nature into your countenance, that people might imagine you to possess it in your disposition too?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arabella.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! pray papa, do not make game of me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Oakley.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not mean it. But you told me just now that you wished to please, and you owned this to be the surest method of doing so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arabella.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, certainly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Oakley.</SPEAKER>
<P>But do you think that such a countenance may not be deceitful, or that one can assume the power of pleasing and lay it down at pleasure?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arabella.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, papa, I think so, for I have heard you and others say a hundred times, "I would never have thought that little girl to have such a deceitful counte∣nance.—That man looked like honesty itself, and yet he has deceived us.—Such a person knows how to compose his face so, that one would swear him to be possest of every virtue."</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Oakley.</SPEAKER>
<P>But did we speak, then, of those that we had seen often, or for a long time, or pretty near us?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arabella.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! I do not know that, papa.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Oakley.</SPEAKER>
<P>Or might not this wrong judgment pro∣ceed from a want of sagacity? or from not sufficiently remarking whether such persons have always the same countenance, or only take it up upon occasion; or in short, whether they speak and act consistently, and uni∣formly?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arabella.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is the meaning of that, papa?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="67" REF="71"/>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Oakley.</SPEAKER>
<P>Whether every thing agrees, their coun∣tenance, their eyes, the sound of their voice, all the fea∣tures of their face; whether any part contradicts, or gives the lie to the other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arabella.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! there are a good many things to mind in that. And yet I should imagine, if I saw any one a long time, and pretty often, and took particular notice of what you have mentioned, I could not be mistaken.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Oakley.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! child, do not be too sure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arabella.</SPEAKER>
<P>However, I think, I can see in my little friends what is affected, and what is natural.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Oakley.</SPEAKER>
<P>So then you suppose that you are knowing enough in the art of disguising the thoughts, and that you have judgment and penetration enough, to distinguish truth from hypocrisy upon a countenance? Really, I should never have expected so much from so light a little head as yours.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arabella.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! I have taken notice in Miss Bloomer, that her prim mouth, her stare, her motions with her head, and that drawling tone of hers, are not natural; and that the elder Miss Archly's proud flouting look, and Miss Drake's free undaunted manner is not at all affected, because the one is really vain and self-conceited, and the other impudent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Oakley.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps they are not far enough advanced in the art of putting on counterfeit looks. However your opinion is, that our aversions and our likings, our faults and our virtues are painted on our faces, and that one can read in a person's features, as in a book, what he is in the bottom of his heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arabella.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why not? I never saw a passionate person with a mild aspect, nor an envious person with a smiling countenance; nor one who was cruel and unfeeling, with looks of tenderness. Only see our neighbour, Mrs. Grim∣ston, how she eyes people as if she would eat them up, and with what a grumbling voice she speaks. Every time that Miss Artichoke, the old maid, comes here, when mama has company, only observe how her eyes go round, to see if any lady present has any thing new or elegant about her dress; and with what looks of jealousy she mea∣sures her from head to foot, as if she was hurt at another's happiness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="68" REF="72"/>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Oakley.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, indeed, we may pretty safely pro∣nounce that the one is envious, and the other passionate. But may it not sometimes happen, that nature should give the same person a happy countenance, and a perverse disposition; or, on the other hand, indifferent features along with a noble heart?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arabella.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not know, but I can hardly believe it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Oakley.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why so?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arabella.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because we may see by a person's figure whether he is weak or strong, sickly or in health; and it must be the same with the disposition.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Oakley.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, now I shall give you two passages from history, that seem to contradict your notion. A certain able physiognomist, called Zopyrus, boasted that from a view of a person's shape and countenance, he could distinguish his manners and ruling passions. After one day looking at Socrates, he judged him to be a man of a bad mind and vicious inclinations, some of which he mentioned. Alcibiades, the friend and scholar of So∣crates, who was well acquainted with his master's merit, could not help laughing at the judgment of the physiog∣nomist and taxing him with gross ignorance. But Socrates confessed that he was really by nature inclined to those vices of which he was accused, and that he preserved himself free from them by the constant exertions of philo∣sophy. Aesop, that slave who was endowed with so much wit, had a person so disagreeable and deformed, that when he stood to be sold he could prevail on nobody to purchase him, until his witty answers shewed them con∣vincingly what he was.—Here are two examples that seem to prove the contrary of what you maintained.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arabella.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well now, that surprizes me as to Socrates: I have often heard you talk of him with admiration. And as to Aesop too, I have read his fables with so much pleasure. I should have thought them both the finest looking persons in the world. But however, it agrees again with what I said, that one may be ordinary, and yet have I don't know what of wit, sensibility, or good∣nature, in the countenance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Oakley.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are right; sickness or grief may alter the features. But that was not the case with Socrates. He owned himself that he was at first viciously inclined, and the features of his face strongly confirmed it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="69" REF="73"/>
<SPEAKER>Arabella.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think his answer explains the difficulty. He was born with a bad disposition, but as he had much good sense at the same time, and saw that passion, pride and envy were terrible vices, he struggled with them and came at length to get the better of them. His heart was purged of his faults, but his countenance kept the marks of them still.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Oakley.</SPEAKER>
<P>You seem to be pretty ready at a reply. Nay, there is some truth, too, in your reasoning. How∣ever, I have a small question to propose to you.—If Miss Archly, that proud little miss, who has a face, you say, expressing disdain and self-conceit, should, from the sen∣sible instructions of her parents, be convinced of her own folly; or if distresses and sickness obliged her to endea∣vour to render herself agreeable to others, by being mild, affable and mannerly, so that she should become quite the contrary to what she is at present; and suppose it were the same with your other little friends, as to the faults that you find in them also; would those marks of pride, affectation or impudence remain still upon their faces? Or when, by continual and redoubled efforts they should have changed their vices into the opposite virtues, would the same alteration take place in their countenances?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arabella.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, certainly, papa.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Oakley.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, the truth may lie between our dif∣ferent ways of arguing. Socrates, when young, yielded to the folly of his passions, and even retained for a long time his choleric temper, since he entreated his friends to admonish him, whenever they saw him ready to give way to it. But in a more advanced age, when he had been instructed in the school of wisdom, he began undoubtedly to combat his vices, to reform himself daily, and to rise by degrees to the highest pitch of perfect on in every mo∣ral virtue. But then it was too late to new-model his features. The muscles and fibres of his face becoming stiff, the beauty of his mind could make no impression through his countenance. It was like the sun in a cloudy sky. Now in childhood, when the features are more ten∣der and flexible, the different movements of the soul are in their turns forcibly impressed on them. So that if by a reform during that period the virtues take place of the vices in the mind, the outward expression of these virtues on the countenance will also efface that of the vices. For
<PB N="70" REF="74"/>the countenance may be compared to a thin veil. If you throw it over the head of a fair Circassian, and afterwards over that of a Negro wench, you will easily see through it the florid bloom of the one, and the sooty blackness of the other. I do not know whether you understand what I mean.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arabelia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! yes, perfectly from that comparison; and to shew you that I do, I will give you one of my own. I have often with the greatest ease cut the letters of my name, or the date of the year, upon a young tree, but I could not do so upon an old one: the bark would have been too hard, and too rugged.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Oakley.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why you surprize me. But even though your comparison should not be quite exact, it is certainly true that if we do not take up a habit of virtue until an advanced age, we shall appear the less amiable in the eyes of others; because our features, long accustomed to express our former vicious inclinations, can with difficulty be modelled to represent our present virtuous sentiments: and what are we to conclude from this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arabella.</SPEAKER>
<P>That we should—that we should—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Oakley.</SPEAKER>
<P>Consider well before you express yourself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arabella.</SPEAKER>
<P>That we should endeavour, while young, to have an amiable countenance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Oakley.</SPEAKER>
<P>But if we are not in our heart what our countenance denotes, would not the contrast be remarked? You said just now of Miss Bloomer, that she was not what she wished to be thought. So, you see—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arabella.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I see that we should strive to be really what we wish to appear. So, for instance, if we would appear mild, modest, reserved, or good-natured, we should struggle against all those inclinations that would hinder us to be so in effect, otherwise our counterfeit looks will soon be discovered. For if one is really mild, modest, reserved, or good-natured, the features of his face will shew it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Oakley.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well, my dear Arabella. And is not that an excellent receipt for obtaining true beauty, and the genuine art of pleasing? How unhappy would those be to whom nature has refused her charms, if they were debarred the hopes of acquiring an amiable and en∣gaging countenance by goodness of heart, and other qua∣lities most pleasing in the sight of God and man. There∣fore,
<PB N="71" REF="75"/>my dear, take my advice; do not go to seek in your glass for the art of appearing better than you really are. But whenever you find yourself ruffled by any pas∣sion, run immediately and consult it. You will see the ugliness of envy, anger or vanity. Then ask yourself, if such a portrait can be agreeable in the eyes of either God or man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arabella.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, papa; your advice is very good, and I will follow it. But I shall reap another advantage from your instructions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Oakley.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arabella.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will look very attentively at every body that I see in company, and strive to discover by their faces what opinion I should have of them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Oakley.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, child, take care how you do so. The first would be contrary to good manners, and unsuitable to the modesty of your sex; and the second would be very dangerous, considering your candour and inexpe∣rience. To discover in the features of any person his disposition or way of thinking, requires long study, re∣peated observations, and a very penetrating judgment. You would find yourself continually deceived in your likings or dislikes. The knowledge of the world will instruct you by degrees. At present study only yourself, and use all the strength of your mind to acquire every virtue, in order to become more amiable and more beau∣tiful.</P>

<HEAD>NARCISSUS AND HIPPOLYTUS.</HEAD>
<P>NARCISSUS and Hippolytus were nearly of the same age, and loved each other from their earliest infancy. As their parents were close neighbours, they had opportunities of being together every day. Mr. Chambers, the father of Narcissus, had a place under government, the profits of which were immense; but the father of Hippolytus, Mr. Marvel, possessed a moderate fortune, on which, however, he lived content, and all his views aimed at making his son happy by the advan∣tages of a well directed education, since he had it not in
<PB N="72" REF="76"/>his power to leave him great riches. To obtain this end, he made choice of means the most worthy of his pru∣dence. Hippolytus, at nine years of age, was formed to all the exercises of the body, and his understanding en∣riched with many useful acquirements. Being constantly in exercise and motion, he was healthy and robust. Al∣ways contented, and happy in the affection of his parents, he enjoyed a mild chearfulness which communicated its influence to these who had the happiness of being in his company. His little neighbour Narcissus was one who felt this happiness; for the moment that Hippolytus left him, he would be quite at a loss for amusement. That his time might not hang wearisome, he was continually eating without being hungry, drinking without being dry, and dozing without being sleepy. So that scarce a day passed but he was troubled with qualms of the sto∣mach, or violent head-achs. Mr. Chambers, as well as Mr. Marvel, tenderly wished his son's happiness; but to procure it he had unfortunately taken the means which were quite opposite to his end. Narcissus from the cradle had been bred up with the utmost delicacy. He had al∣ways a servant behind him, to hand him a chair whenever he had a mind to change his seat. He was drest and un∣drest as if he had not the use of his hands. It seemed as if all those who were about him only breathed for him, and that he could not help himself even to live. While Hippolytus, in a thin linen jacket, helped his father to cultivate a little garden for his amusement, Narcissus, in a fine scarlet coat, was lolling in a chariot, paying morn∣ing visits with his mama. If ever he went to take the country air, and alighted out of the carriage but for a moment, they took particular care to put his great coat on, and a handkerchief round his head, for fear he should catch cold. Accustomed as he was to be humoured in his slightest fancies, he wished for every thing that he saw; but this wish lasted only for a moment; and the more troublesome it was to procure him what he wished, the sooner he was tired of it. To spare him the smallest subject of ill humour, his mother had ordered all the ser∣vants to respect even his follies. This ill-judged indul∣gence made him so whimsical and imperious that every body in the house hated and despised him. Besides his parents, Hippolytus was the only person that loved him
<PB N="73" REF="77"/>and could patiently put up with his humours. He knew how to manage his temper, and could make him even good humoured like himself.</P>
<P>How do you contrive to be always so merry? said Mr. Chambers to him one day. I do not well know, sir, an∣swered he. It comes of itself. But my papa tells me, that one is never perfectly happy, without mixing a little work with one's play. And I have observed it, too, whenever any strangers come to our house, and we quit our work to entertain them: I never find my time hang heavy but on such days. It is this mixture of exercise and amusement that makes me always be in good health. I fear neither the winds, nor the rain; neither the heat of the day, nor the cold of the evening; and I have almost dug up a whole plat in my garden, before poor Narcissus quits his bed of a morning. Mr. Chambers heaved a sigh; and that very day he went to consult Mr. Marvel how he should act, in order to make his son as healthy and as chearful as Hippo∣lytus. Mr. Marvel took pleasure in answering his ques∣tions, and laid before him the plan that he had followed. The powers of the body and of the mind, said he, should be equally kept in exercise, unless they are meant to be unserviceable, as money buried in the ground would be even to its owner. Nothing can be imagined more pre∣judicial to the health and happiness of children, than to give them a pusillanimous turn, by using them to exces∣sive delicacy; and from a pernicious complaisance, to give way to their whimsical and obstinate humours. To what vexatious disappointments will not a man be ex∣posed, who has been accustomed from his childhood to see even his follies flattered; since of all the warmest wishes of his heart, he may happen to see scarcely one accomplished, and thus be led basely to murmur against his destiny, when he should for the most part thank heaven for rejecting his infatuated vows? He added, with tokens of heart-felt satisfaction, that Hippolytus would certainly never be that unhappy person. Mr. Chambers was struck with this discourse, and resolved to conduct his son to happiness by the same way. Alas! it was too late. Narcissus now was fourteen years old, and his mind, so long enervated, could not bear any exertion, though ever so little fatiguing. His mother, as weak as himself, entreated her husband not to teaze their darling.
<PB N="74" REF="78"/>Her husband, wearied out with these entreaties, dropped the sensible design that he had formed; and the darling sunk more and more into habits of pernicious effemi∣nacy. Thus the strength of his body declined, in pro∣portion as his mind was degraded by ignorance. At sea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th, when he had gained the age of seventeen, his pa∣rents sent him to the university, intending him after∣wards for the study of the law. Hippolytus being des∣tined for the same profession, accompanied his young friend. I had forgot to mention that Hippolytus, in his different studies and acquirements, had never had any other instructor than his father. Narcissus had as many masters as there are different accomplishments to acquire; and he remembered a few of the terms used by each of them tolerably well. This was all the fruit of his studies. The understanding of Hippolytus, on the contrary, was like a garden whose airy situation every where admits the kindly rays of the sun, and in which every seed, by a judicious cultivation, comes rapidly to the growth. Al∣ready well instructed, he earnestly desired fresh know∣ledge. His diligence and good behaviour afforded a pat∣tern for imitation to his companions. His mild temper, his lively apprehension and joyous humour, made his company strongly attracting. Every body loved him, and every body wished to be his friend. Narcissus at first was happy to be in the same lodging with him. But very soon his pride, mortified by the esteem that Hippo∣lytus had acquired, would not suffer him to be longer a witness to it. He therefore separated from him upon a frivoious pretence. Being now left to himself, and his own vitiated taste, he sighed for pleasure, and thought∣lessly snatched at whatever seemed to offer her deceitful image to his view. I shall not attempt to describe to you how often he blushed for himself, and how from one imprudence to another, he fell at last into the grossest irregularities. It will suffice to inform you that he re∣turned to his father's house with the seeds of a mortal distemper in his bosom; that he languished six months on a bed of pain, and expired in the severest agonies. Hippolytus came home to his parents, regretted both by his teachers and his companions, and enriched with a treasure of learning and prudence. With what trans∣ports of joy was he received by his family! O children,
<PB N="75" REF="79"/>how sweet a thing it is to make ourselves beloved by all who know us, and at the same time to feel ourselves wor∣thy of this universal affection! His mother thought her∣self the happiest of women; and tears of joy filled his father's eyes whenever he beheld him. A considerable employment in his profession was conferred on him with the unanimous approbation of all who knew his charac∣ter, and enabled him to gratify his ardent desire of pro∣moting the happiness of his friends. And he enjoyed their happiness as much as they did themselves. His parents, too, shared the same generous sentiments, and lived in affluence to a good old age. He took pleasure in repaying them with interest the attentions which they had shewed for him. A wife endowed with beauty and virtue, and children resembling himself, made his hap∣piness complete. Whenever, therefore, any man was mentioned as being both happy and worthy to be so, the name of Hippolytus always occurred first to the thoughts of those who knew him.</P>

<HEAD>THE MAN WHO ROSE TO SUDDEN FORTUNE.</HEAD>
<P>ONE fine evening, in the month of June, Mr. Russel went out with his son Eugene, to take a walk in some of the most agreeable environs of the city. The weather was mild, the sky clear, the purling streams and waving trees lulled them to an agreeable thoughtfulness. What a lovely evening! said Eugene, enchanted with the beauties of nature that surrounded him. He pressed his father's hand, and said to him, If you knew, papa, what thoughts rise in my heart! He was silent for a mo∣ment, then lifting up towards heaven his eyes which were moistened with tears. I thank my God, said he, for the happy moments that he gives me to enjoy. Oh! that every body could taste the beauties of the evening as I do! That all mankind overflowed with joy, as I do at this moment! I could wish to be king over a large coun∣try that I might make all my subjects happy. Mr. Rus∣sel embraced his son. My dear Eugene, said he, the
<PB N="76" REF="80"/>benevolent wish that you have just expressed, comes from a heart as generous as humane. But would not your thoughts change with your fortune? Would you preserve in an exalted station these sentiments that animate you now in the middling condition to which heaven has ap∣pointed you?</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eugene.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why do you ask that question, papa? cannot one become rich without becoming cruel or wicked?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Russel.</SPEAKER>
<P>It does not always happen so, my dear. There are some fortunate persons who remember their past distresses, and in whom this reflection produces sen∣timents of charity towards the unfortunate. But to the disgrace of the human heart, a change of fortune fre∣quently alters affections the most tender and sympathetic. While we are unfortunate ourselves, we think that hea∣ven requires it of all men as a duty to relieve our suffer∣ings. If the hand of God remove misfortune from us, we conclude all his intents in the preservation of the uni∣verse to be fulfilled; and we no longer think of those wretches that remain in the gulf from which we have been rescued. We have an instance of this in the man who comes sometimes to ask relief of me. I give it to him with a reluctance that I cannot conquer, though I reproach myself for it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eugene.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why true, papa; I observed that you put your alms coldly into his hand, without ever giving him those words of comfort that you do to other poor people.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Russel.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will shew you, my dear, whether he de∣serves them. Mr. Lowe was a linen-draper in the Mino∣ries. Though the profits of his business were but mode∣rate, a poor person never appeared at his door in vain. This was all the pleasure that he indulged himself in pur∣chasing; and he thought himself happy to enjoy it, though he could not command even this to the full extent of his wishes. Business called him one day upon Change. He saw in one part of it a number of principal merchants together, who were talking of vast cargoes, and immense profits to be expected from them. Ah! said he to himself, sighing, how happy these people are! If I were as rich, heaven knows, I should not be so for myself alone, and that the poor should partake of my abundance. He goes home full of ambitious thoughts, but how can his narrow business enable him to fulfil his<PB N="77" REF="81"/>vast projects? With tolerable oeconomy, it was no more than sufficient to afford him a decent subsistence the year <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound. "I shall always be at a stand here!" cried he, "and never rise above this middling condition in which I linger at present." A hand-bill, inviting adventurers to purchase in the lottery, was at this moment put into his hand. He seized the idea with eagerness, as if in∣spired by fortune; and without minding the inconvenience to which his covetousness might reduce him, he went to the lottery-office, and laid out four guineas, the only money that he could spare in the world. With what impatience he waited for the drawing! He one time re∣pented having so foolishly hazarded a stake, the loss of which would disturb him. At another time he fancied that he saw riches falling down upon him in showers. At last the drawing began.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eugene.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, papa, did he get a prize?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Russel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Five thousand pounds.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eugene.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aha! he would jump for joy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Russel.</SPEAKER>
<P>He went immediately and received his mo∣ney, and spent some days in thinking of nothing else. When he had had enough of that, I can put this sum to a better use, said he, than barely poring over it. He therefore enlarged his stock, extended his dealings, and by his ac∣tivity and knowledge of trade he soon doubled his capital. In less than ten years he became one of the richest men in the city. It must be said in his praise, that he had till then been faithful to his vow, in making the poor partake of his abundance. At the fight of an unfortunate person he remembered his own former condition without being ashamed of it. And this recollection never failed of pro∣fiting the person who occasioned it. Led by degrees to frequent fine company, he contracted a taste for luxury and dissipation. He purchased a magnificent country∣house and fine gardens, and his life became a round of pleasures and amusement. The most extravagant whims he gratified without scruple, but soon perceived that they had made a considerable breach in his fortune. Trade, which he had given up in order to be quite at leisure to enjoy himself, no longer enabled him to repair it. Be∣sides, a habit of indulgence and a mean vanity would not suffer him to lessen his expences. I shall always have enough for one, thought he; let others provide for them∣selves.
<PB N="78" REF="82"/>His heart, hardened in this resolution, was thenceforth shut to the unfortunate. He heard the cries of misery around him, as one hears the tempest grumble, when sheltered from its fury. Friends whom he had till then supported, came to solicit him for fresh relief. But he refused them harshly. Have I made a fortune, said he, only to squander it upon you? Do as I do, said he, depend upon yourselves. His mother, whom he had cut short of half the pension that he allowed her, came to beg for a retired shelter in a corner of his house, there to spend her few remaining days; but he had the barbarity to refuse her, and with dry eyes beheld her die in misery. This crime, however, did not long remain unpunished. His debaucheries very soon exhausted all his wealth, and deprived him of the strength necessary to support himself by work. In short, he was reduced to the state of misery in which you see him, and now begs his bread from door to door, an object of contempt and indignation to all honest people.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eugene.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! papa, since fortune can make men so wicked, I wish to remain as I am.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Russel.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear Eugene, I wish the same for the sake of your happiness; but if heaven destines you to a more exalted station, may you never forseit the nobleness and generosity of your soul. Think often of the story that I have just now told you. Learn from this example, that we can never taste true happiness, without feeling for the misfortunes of others; that it is the powerful man's duty to comfort the sorrows of the weak; and that he reaps more true happiness from the performance of this duty, than from all his pomp and luxury.</P>
<P>The sun was now going to set, and his parting beams threw a lively glow upon the clouds which seemed to form a purple curtain round his bed. The air, freshened at the approach of evening, breathed an agreeable calm. The birds, in repeating their farewel songs, rallied all their powers of melody. The leaves of the grove mingled a gentle murmur with their concert, and every thing seemed to inspire sentiments of joy and happiness; but Eugene and his father, instead of the transports which they had felt at first, returned home lost in melancholy reflexions.</P>

<P>AH! my poor little Diana! I shall never be able to sit at work without you. It was here on this little cushion that you lay down beside me, while I was at my needle.

<P>Did I not beg of you to leave her at home? but you could not go a step without having her at your heels.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eustace.</SPEAKER>
<P>I own it. I was so pleased when she was along with me, to see her walk sometimes before me, and some∣times behind me. Then she would run from me as if I was pursuing her, and come back again at full speed, and jump up about me so playful.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Serina.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you should have taken better care of her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eustace.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I should so. But as she used to go away from me, and come back of herself without any occasion for my calling her, I thought—</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Serina.</SPEAKER>
<P>You thought?—you have never the least mis∣trust of any thing; and by that poor Diana was lost.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eustace.</SPEAKER>
<P>I promise you, sister, the next time—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Serina.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, another time when we have nothing to lose. I could not sleep a quarter of an hour together all last night. I thought I heard her whining to me at a dis∣tance, and that I ran to the side from which her cries seemed to come. Then I awoke, and found myself alone. Ah! I dare say she is as dull too, for her part.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eustace.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear sister, it makes me doubly unhappy to see you grieve so. I would give all that I am worth in the world to have her again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Serina.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now you make me grieve still more. Why, don't you know at least where you missed her? One might enquire amongst all the neighbours thereabouts.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eustace.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'd lay a wager she followed me into this street, and almost as far as our own house too. But as she runs up into every court smelling about, somebody must have shut their door upon her and kept her in.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Serina.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I dare say it was so; otherwise she would have come back to her lodging. She knows the way to it well enough.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eustace.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lionel was along with me, and declared to me that he saw her but the moment before we missed her. And it was his fault; for he was playing such comical tricks as we walked along, that I forgot Diana just then.</P>

<P>So he did all yesterday evening, and to-day again very early. We went into all the streets and lanes round about, and searched every court and market near us.

<P>Nay, I only tell you her own words. That little cur dog, says she, that belongs to that pretty young gentleman, your acquaintance? Yes, said I, the same. Well, you know another little master that lives here be∣low,

<P>That is very true. I recollect it now.</P>

<P>Well, when we had past her house a little way, he called Diana as she was following us, and offered her a bit of cake, and while the poor thing was busy feasting herself, he snatched her up in his arms and carried her home. The good woman told me the whole trick.</P>

<P>What have you done to Rufus? He came to me as I was in my room, and seemed quite ruffled. He complains of you very much, but particularly of Lionel, and says that you accuse him of stealing Diana. Is she lost?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Ah! yes, papa. I did not like to tell you, because I hoped every moment to find her again. She went astray from me yesterday evening.</P>

<P>Ah! you cannot imagine how sorry I am for her. I cried the best part of last night, when I awoke and missed her from my side.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Calv.</SPEAKER>
<P>Luckily, it is but a dog. Losses of much more consequence happen every day in the world, and we should early accustom ourselves to bear with them. But you,
<STAGE>(to Eustace)</STAGE> why did not you take care of her?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eustace.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are very right, papa. It was my fault. I should have left her at home, or else not have lost sight of her, since I took her in my charge. And I am sorry for it especially, on account of my sister, because Diana was hers more than mine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Serina.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot be angry with my brother for it. I have sometimes vexed him without intention, and he has excused me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="87" REF="91"/>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Calv.</SPEAKER>
<P>Kiss me, my dear child; I love to see you bear a misfortune with courage; but I am still better pleased to see you, in the midst of your grief, not the least provoked against him that occasioned it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Serina.</SPEAKER>
<P>My poor brother is sufficiently punished for his negligence, for he was as fond of Diana as I. She was all his amusement; and he grieves, besides, that he was the occasion of my uneasiness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Calv.</SPEAKER>
<P>Always preserve these sentiments, my dear children, one towards the other, and indeed towards all your fellow-creatures, for they are of the same family. I know many persons who, for such a trifle, would have turned away an honest servant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Serina.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! heaven forbid! Prefer a dog to a servant? A creature without reason to a person of our own kind?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Calv.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why do not all men make that difference as well as you, my dear child? We should not then know those who would rather see a poor child suffer hunger or thirst than a favourite dog; who shed tears at the indis∣position of a spaniel, and look without pity on the lot of an unhappy orphan abandoned by all the world.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Serina.</SPEAKER>
<P>papa! is it possible?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Calv.</SPEAKER>
<P>In return for the sentiment which draws that generous sigh from your breast, I promise you, my dear, a greyhound as handsome as the one that you have lost, if you are not lucky enough to find her again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Serina.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, papa, I thank you. I have suffered too much from the loss of Diana. If she does not come back, I will never have another. I will not run the risque of grieving so again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Calv.</SPEAKER>
<P>You carry things too far, my dear Serina. In that case we must resign all the most agreeable plea∣sures of life. We should be afraid to love a friend, be∣cause death or absence might one day separate us from him. If you compare the pleasure which Diana's play∣ful fondness has afforded you ever since she was born, to the short uneasiness that her loss occasions to you now, the first you will find exceeds the second by a great deal. Nothing is more natural than to be fond of a pretty little creature, like Diana; and indeed, it would be a mark of ingratitude in you—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Serina.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, if I did not think of her now, because she is not here to play about me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="88" REF="92"/>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Calv.</SPEAKER>
<P>What comforts me a little in this misfortune is, that from this you will be better enabled to bear per∣haps a greater. Every thing that we possess upon earth may slip from our hands with the same readiness, and it is wise to accustom ourselves early to the most severe losses. But, with regard to our first subject of conversation, you have treated Rufus ill, it seems.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Serina.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not we, papa; we spoke to him very mildly. It was Lionel that touched him close a little.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Calv.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what did he say in answer?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eustace.</SPEAKER>
<P>He defended himself but lamely. Indeed he was quite out of countenance at the first question.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Serina.</SPEAKER>
<P>But now I will ask you, papa, do you think that he could have the assurance to deny it, if he had really taken my greyhound?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Calv.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can say nothing as to that; but, I should think, his confusion could not come from a very clear con∣science. However, that we may have no reproach to make to ourselves, concerning Diana, we must advertise her to-morrow in the public papers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eustace.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, papa, if she is really in his power, that trouble will be useless.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Calv.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, it cannot be useless. A dog requires to be fed, and is not so small or so quiet that one can hide it from every body's eyes. There may happen to be some person in his house honest enough to give us information of it. I will not apply to his father, I know his rude manners too well. Besides, he is offended with me for forbidding you a too close intimacy with his son. We must wait to see what our advertisement will produce.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Serina.</SPEAKER>
<P>I should have some hopes from it, if I were able to promise a large reward to whoever would bring me back the dog.</P>

<HEAD>THE HEN.</HEAD>
<P>HOW happy was Cyprian in so worthy and affectionate a father as Mr. Tisdall. Whenever he had shown himself for any length of time discreet and diligent, he was assured that his father would not fail to testify his satisfaction with some recompence or other. Cyprian had a taste for gardening, and began, about the age of twelve, to cultivate choice flowers. His father saw it, and imme∣diately began to study how he might afford his son more pleasure.</P>
<P>They were both at dinner. Cyprian, said his father, your preceptor has informed me, that you have begun this very day to read the Roman History, and the Geography of Italy. If, in a week, you can but give me an exact account of every thing you may have learned on these two subjects, you cannot think what I intend shall recompence your application!</P>
<P>Cyprian, one may easily suppose, did not forget such a promise. He employed himself in studying all the week, to get this recompence; or rather, he received such plea∣sure from his study, that indeed it was he who should have bestowed a recompence on his Papa if he had been able.</P>
<P>He saw the day of trial come, without anxiety; and underwent the examination like an hero. He had learned the history of all the kings of Rome, and marked out in his map the gradual progress of that growing empire.</P>
<P>In a transport of delight, his father took him by the hand, embraced and kissed him. Come, says he, since you have sought to give me so much pleasure, it is but just that I should contribute in my turn to yours. Saying this, he led him into an adjoining garden, pointed out a vacant spot to him, and told him that it was to be his. You may part it in two, continued he; and plant what flowers you like in one, and any vegetables that you think proper in the other. After this, they went into an out-house, close behind the gardener's hut, where Cyprian found a spade, a watering-pot, a rake, and other implements of garden∣ing, all perfectly adapted to his size and strength. On the walls were baskets hung up, of every size, great and small,
<PB N="98" REF="106"/>and on shelves about them, sundry boxes full of roots, and bags of seeds; the whole together duly ticketed, with cards on every box and bag, marking the proper time for sowing each article.</P>
<P>One should be of Cyprian's age to know the excess of his joy upon this occasion. In his mind, the little spot of earth which his father had assigned him, was as great as monarchs think their kingdoms; and whatever hours of relaxation his preceptor let him take, and which he spent before in folly, were now taken up in cultivating his domain.</P>
<P>One day, when he came in from doing something about his garden he forgot to shut the gate. A hen was pecking near the spot, and took it in her head to go a hunting on his grounds. The flower-bed had been strewed but lately with a layer of the richest mould, and was consequently quite full of worms.</P>
<P>The hen, charmed with such delicious fare, began to scratch the mould up, and employ her beak as well as talons to unearth the worms; and in particular, she took a mighty inclination to a part, where Cyprian had, the day, before been planting some fine pinks.</P>
<P>How great therefore was the excess of his rage when coming back to his plantation, he beheld the door a jar, and this new-fashioned gardener digging up his beds? Ah! ah! you impudent slut! said he; your bones shall pay for this. And immediately he shut the door, for fear his victim should escape, and picking up flint stones, sand, clods of earth, and whatever he could lay hold of, he threw them at the bird, pursuing her all the while as close as he could.</P>
<P>The frightened hen, at one time ran with all her speed, and at another time strove to fly upon the wall, but found that her wings would not befriend her in reaching such a height. Unhappily, she fell back more than once on Cyprian's flowers, and got her wings and feet entangled with the finest hyacinths.</P>
<P>Young Cyprian, beholding her thus embroiled, sup∣posed that he had her fast. Two rows of tulips separated them. His anger was so vehement, that stepping over, as he meant to do, this interval of separation between the hen and him, he trod them down himself. The hen, however, at her enemy's approach, redoubled her former
<PB N="99" REF="107"/>efforts, and attempted now a second time to gain the wall. She rose a great deal higher than before, yet still came short; but what was matter of regret for Cyprian, bore away with her from underneath as she rose, a beautiful rose-bud-coloured ten-belled hyacinth. On this, he seized his rake, and flung it at the bird with all his strength. The rake turned round, and while he fancied it upon the point of hitting the fugitive mark, it came down, and dashed two panes of glass to pieces in a melon frame, as well as broke out two of its own teeth upon the ground.</P>
<P>The little Fury, made much more furious by these damages, had run for his spade, and now the combat would perhaps have had fatal consequences for his feather∣ed adversary, who fatigued and giddy had crept in be∣tween a rose-bush and the wall, if Mr. Tisdall, at first attracted to his window by the noise, had not made haste to her assistance.</P>
<P>The moment Cyprian saw his father, he stood stock still in evident confusion; however he made shift to find his tongue at last, and cried out, See, papa, what ravage this vile creature has committed in my garden.</P>
<P>Had you shut the door replied his father with an affect∣ed indifference, this ravage would not have been made. I saw your whole behaviour. Are you not ashamed of ha∣ving put forth all your strength against a harmless hen? She has no <HI>reason</HI> to conduct herself, and though she has rooted up your pinks, it was not with a wish to do you any damage, but to get her ordinary food. Now, Cyprian, should you have put yourself thus into a passion, if she had scratched up nothing but as many nettle roots? And how can she distinguish between pinks and nettles? It is your∣self alone that are to blame for all this havock. With precaution you would certainly have driven her out so that she might do no further mischief; and in that case, neither your rake, nor my melon frame, would have gone to ruin, or your loss have exceeded that of a few flowers. Therefore you alone are punishable, so that were I to cut a branch off from this hazle-tree, and with it make you suffer just what you designed the hen should suffer—which of us would act with the greatest justice? I shall not, how∣ever, go to this extremity, purposely to shew you that we may all suppress our resentment, if we think proper. Notwithstanding, for the damage done to my melon frame,
<PB N="100" REF="108"/>I shall deduct as much as will repair it, from the arrears of your allowance in my hands; for I am not to suffer through your rashness.</P>
<P>Cyprian, upon this, withdrew much abashed, and all day durst scarcely lift his eyes up, while before his father.</P>
<P>On the morrow, Mr. Tisdall proposed a walk, and asked if he desired to join him. Cyprian followed, but oppressed with sadness which he sought in vain to hide. His father saw it, and affecting a degree of wonder, wished to know why he appeared so grievously dejected.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cyprian.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have I not the greatest cause to be dejected? For this whole month past, I have denied myself so many pleasures, merely to buy something for my sister. I had saved ten shillings, with which I thought to purchase her a pretty hat; but must give the half of it perhaps to have your melon frame repaired.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Tisdall.</SPEAKER>
<P>I dare say, you would have been delighted to oblige your sister, but my melon frame, however, must be paid for first. This lesson will teach you in future not to yield yourself up to the mischiefs of resentment which in general aggravates the first misfortune happening to us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cyprian.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! you may depend upon it, sir, I will ne∣ver leave the garden-door open again, or take revenge upon a hen for what would be my own omission.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Tisdall.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, pray tell me, do you fancy that, in this vast universe, hens only have it in their power to do you damage?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cyprian.</SPEAKER>
<P>O! no, no; for look ye, not above a week ago I left my map upon the table while I went a walking, and my little sister coming into the room, with a pen and ink so blotted it all over, that no one could distinguish Europe from America.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Tisdall.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then it is prudent to secure yourself against the mischiefs that you may suffer from your fellow-crea∣tures.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cyprian.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is so, papa.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Tisdall.</SPEAKER>
<P>Without desiring in the least to give you a distaste of life, I can assure you that you will have to suffer many disagreeable affairs, and those a deal more prejudicial to you, than the mischiefs caused by the hen. Mankind always seek their interest and their pleasures,
<PB N="101" REF="109"/>just as hens seek worms; and they will do so at the hazard of your interests, as hens will at the hazard of your flowers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cyprian.</SPEAKER>
<P>I see it plainly, sir, by Bella's behaviour; since the little pleasure that she received from scribbling on a bit of paper, has occasioned me the loss of an extremely useful map.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Tisdall.</SPEAKER>
<P>But could you not have avoided this loss, by putting up your map before you left the apartment?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cyprian.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Tisdall.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then think for the future to conduct your∣self so, that no body may have power to do you any real mischief; but if after all, in spite of your precaution, you should be so unlucky as to receive an injury, consider how you may endure it, so as not to render the first wrong still more prejudicial.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cyprian.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, papa; but how must I endure it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Tisdall.</SPEAKER>
<P>With indifference, if it be a slight injury, but, on the other hand, if a great one, with courage. Now that we are by ourselves, I dare propose you as an example the conduct that I pursue towards Mr. Hotham.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cyprian.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray don't speak of him, papa. These two years past, he takes no notice of you whenever you meet each other, and there cannot be a falsity that he will not say to prejudice you in the opinion of the world.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Tisdall.</SPEAKER>
<P>And do you know what urges him to such behaviour?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cyprian.</SPEAKER>
<P>That I never yet durst ask you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Tisdall.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing but for the preference which I obtained respecting an employ that my father had so wor∣thily filled up for five and thirty years, and to which he had affectionately formed me by the most diligent instruction. Mr. Hotham had no title to the post, except his ignorance and self-sufficiency. My right succeeded, notwithstanding all his interest, and therefore am I honoured with his calum∣ny and hatred.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cyprian.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! papa, were I as big as you, I'd teach him better manners.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Tisdall.</SPEAKER>
<P>Quite the contrary, I let him go on rail∣ing at me just as he thinks fit. The conduct which you should have pursued, when you were injured by the hen, I faithfully pursue towards him. The pinks that she scratched up by the roots, in seeking for worms, may
<PB N="102" REF="110"/>represent the reputable character that I bear, and which in order to gratify the worm of Envy that gnaws him, he labours to undo. Were I to seek the means of punishing him, I should trample under foot that deference and respect which I owe to myself, as you trod under foot your tulips. The me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on frame and rake which you damaged, are that wealth and peace of mind that I should destroy, by hurry∣ing on to vengeance. Taught in future by the losses that you have suffered, you will shut the garden door, in order to keep the hen out. Taught too by the wicked disposi∣tion of my enemy, I lay, by means of proper conduct on my part, an insuperable barrier between us. Thus in∣accessible to his vindictive attempts, I enjoy the comforts of my moderation, while he spends himself in those at∣tempts, and will in time experience the compunction of his evil conscience. Could his insults vex me, I should make myself the victim that he would sacrifice, and be reproached for imbecility, by every worthy character of my acquaintance; while on the other hand the insensibili∣ty that I manifest for his injurious treatment yields him to his own contempt, and, in the bosom of good men, keeps up the reputation that I have gained among them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cyprian.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! papa, what trouble may I not shun here∣after, by remembering every thing that you have taught me!</P>
<P>These last words were hardly uttered, when they found themselves at home, without imagining that they had been so near it. Their discourse, for the remainder of the day, was a continuation of the past; and bed-time being come, they separated quite content with one another. Cyprian sunk to slumber, with a bosom full of gratitude for the in∣struct on which he had just received, and Mr. Tisdall with one possessing all the satisfaction that a good father cannot but experience, who is sensible that he has done something to promote his offspring's happiness.</P>

<P>How, Clara? I assure you, Sophy has assisted us surprizingly. It was she that held the stuff while we were cutting it, handed us the pincushion, and picked us up our thimbles when they fell. Here, my little dear, take the sciffars: Leonora wants them.</P>

<P>Think so? Certainly.</P>

<P>Of what real pleasure, even at present, are you not deprived, by having hitherto neglected an employment so adapted to your sex and age?</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>The Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear little lady, learn betimes, if you would be considered provident or prudent, to love work; or it will soon be too late. I should be very happy now, had any one but given me such a lesson in my childhood. I could now have got my br<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad, and been of use to those dependant on me for support, instead of being burthen∣some to worthy people.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Vincent.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly, my good friend, it would have been much happier for you, I must own, although I should have lost the pleasure of assisting you. But you are yet full young enough to make up for lost time, by ap∣plication to some honest labour. Children, you must know, I have procured her some employment at a weaver's in the neighbourhood; and when she happens to have

<P>I am very glad of that; for I will go too, and help her, if I am able.</P>

<P>Contented? My benevolent and gene∣rous lady, I shall owe you all my happiness, and that, too, of my destitute and friendless children.

<P>Mary Anne cannot be long before she brings the bushel; and indeed she might have gone into the house, found one, and returned in much less time than this. However, in the interval, Eugenia, put them in your apron.</P>

<P>Yes, yes; that would make fine work indeed. To spot it all from top to bottom! What do you suppose mama would say? and therefore I have thought of some∣thing else. Your hat is biggest; so I will add my straw∣berries to yours, and you shall go and gather more, while I am picking these.</P>

<P>They ought at least, then, to be friends again, as soon as we are. Our worst quarrels never come to bloodshed.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Douglas.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; because our parents settle them: but men, Eugenia, are not children; and won't let them∣selves be governed, if they have but arms. And in fact, is it right that we should suffer any one to injure us, without resisting?</P>

<P>A good reason why; because I am to be one. Look ye, sister; notwithstanding any thing that you say against it, war is a very charming thing. Without it, how do you imagine that we should live; would our papa's little fortune be sufficient to support us? But do not weep. You grieve me.</P>

<P>Fie! sir, how you talk! no, it is not for that: they should be at your service, were they not in∣tended for

<P>His illness, however, it is to be hoped, is not yet quite desperate, since he thinks of eating strawberries.</P>

<P>No, not that. It is true, indeed, he has been troubled with the rheumatism, all last winter, to a very great degree; and is not yet quite cured. But cured or not, he must set out to-morrow.</P>

<P>No, not till to-morrow.

<P>No, sir; it takes you to the village.</P>

<P>And the village, I suppose, belongs to your papa?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eugenia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Belongs to him? I wish, indeed, he were so rich: he has nothing but a little cottage, with a garden, this small grove, and yonder meadow. When he is not at the regiment, he passes all his time here with us.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord C.</SPEAKER>
<P>He was ill then, in the winter?</P>

<P>Yes indeed, sir, to our sorrow; and he could not move a limb. Besides, a wound which he received many years ago, below the temple, has broke out afresh. And now that he is almost well, he must be forced to go again, to meet with new misfortunes.</P>

<P>And yet, you do not appear so very young; but are your papa and mama still living?</P>

<SPEAKER>Lord C. </SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(a little disconcerted.)</STAGE>
<P>Do you doubt it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eugenia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, I warrant you, they cried at parting with you. How could they consent to lose you? I remember how much grief it caused mama and us, when first my eldest brother went abroad to study; and that is nothing in comparison of war.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord C.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot tell that; for I have left them after many separations; in which case it is nothing to leave one another. And besides, when first I went to camp, my father went with me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eugenia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did he? Oh, those fathers that are soldiers themselves, are a little hard, I can tell you; but yet that is not the case with my papa. He is so indulgent! Why, a child is scarce so gentle! It is upon the point of honour alone that he can never be persuaded; so that after all, I fancy he himself is to blame, and nobody else, for his re∣maining still in the service.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay indeed? How is that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eugenia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because he never asked for his dismission. He is ever saying, people would imagine him a coward, should he quit the service during war. He only wishes that he may always have but strength enough to sit on horseback; and then, he says, he will part with every drop of blood he has, to serve his country. Well he will have his wish one time or other, but we poor children, then, shall be without a father.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Recollect, your father has been hitherto pre∣served from danger; and why should he not continue still as safe? It is not every musquet that hits.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eugenia.</SPEAKER>
<P>But those that do, commonly kill their man; and in the number, may there not be one that will reach papa?</P>

<P>Yes, sister, he shall see our tears; and we will tell him how extremely ill papa was all the winter; how indifferent he is at present; and how much we should la∣ment his going from us. Do you think, sir, he would be so cruel as to send us from him, and not grant us our request?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord C.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot think that of him, my good friends; but if he be not come already on his way thus far, there is room to fear that he will delay his setting out from London longer; and you know, in that case, you would lose your pains, as your papa must march to-morrow. Happily, however, there is a gentleman, his friend, who can do every thing, as if he were my lord himself; and he is at present with the regiment, serving as a volunteer.</P>

<P>Go, dear children; but first take some trifle from me, as a recompence for the agreeable half-hour that I have spent in conversation with you. Here, my sweet Eugenia, take this ring: it is a little too big, but may soon be fitted to your finger.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Greville.</SPEAKER>
<P>And this false modesty would have been death to me, and have left these innocents without a father, but that Providence has ordered your affairs much better. Every thing, however, now, is to be pardoned. All my wish is, that we had here the generous nobleman who brought us this glad news, that we might thank him for his kindness to our little ones, and also for his message, which, if the truth were known, I dare engage he has in some degree been instrumental in procuring; for what likelihood is there that I, an unknown woman, should by myself have so far succeeded beyond every thing that I could ever have wished?</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord C.</SPEAKER>
<P>For this blessing, you and they are debtors to the king. I have done nothing but solicited his bounty, wishing that I might prove the channel through which it should flow. Hearing accidentally, dear madam, of your application, I determined to support it with my little in∣terest, and, if possible, to get more than was solicited. You owe this interference to my knowledge of the captain's merit; being, as I was, convinced how much he had in∣structed his inferior officers, and been of benefit to those above him. Upon this account, I did not think it rea∣sonable that he should still be forced to serve among us, when his infirmity made service painful to him. And still more, to shew how heartily I prosecuted this affair, with pleasure I took advantage of our march so near his habi∣tation, to bring down myself the news of my success, and glad the bosom of his spouse and children with it. This, believe me, is a joy, that I shall never forget.

<HEAD>GEORGE AND CECILIA.</HEAD>
<P>LITTLE George, an orphan, had been brought up from his infancy by L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dy Eustace, who, together with Lord Eustace, were retired from London, and resided in a small country town. From the tenderness with which they treated him, a stranger in the family would have imagined him to be really their son. This worthy couple had but one child left them, and that a girl, named Ce∣cilia, who was nearly of an age with George: and Lady Eustace had the satisfaction to behold a more than com∣mon mutual sondness subsist between the children.</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="142"/>One delightful morning, towards the end of August, George and Cecilia, with their little friend Lucinda, whose parents lived that summer in the neighbourhood, were out a sauntering in the orchard. The two little girls, of which the youngest (namely Cecilia) was not yet quite eight years old, were arm in arm; and walking with that lovely negligence and those unstudied graces so peculiar to a state of childhood, they hummed over a de∣lightful roundelay, then fashionable in the mouth of every songster in the village, while little George preceded them at leisure, piping on an English flute, to harmonize their discords.</P>
<P>What a series of delightful gambols entertained them in the or<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hard! But at last, our Cecilia and Lucinda both cast a longing look upon the fruit-trees round about them. In particular, an apple-tree attracted their atten∣tion. All the apples had been gathered several days be∣fore; but still, a few that had been overlooked, were here and there discovered hanging, and the deep vermillion that tinged them, and which the leaves could not entirely hide, invited, as it were, the hand to come and take them. George sprung forward, climbed the tree which they were admiring, and threw down as many apples as his hand c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld reach, while the children held their aprons open to receive them.</P>
<P>Chance so ordered it, that two or three of what were thought the finest fell into Lacinda's, who piqued her∣self upon this accidental distribution, as she might have done with reason, had it been a pre-determined prefer∣ence, since George was in reality the prettiest and politest little fellow in the place.</P>
<P>Lucinda, with a joy and triumph in her eyes, that looked like insult, thus addressed herself to Cecilia: "Do but see how fine and large my apples are, while yours are hardly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lf so h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>some!" Cecilia, at these words, hung down her head, and putting on a serious countenance, kept silence during the remainder of their wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k. It was in vain that George studied, by a hundred assiduties, to bring the little maiden back to reason, to spread a smile again upon her cloaded countenance, and to make those lips pronounce a syilable, whose prattle ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> till then been so agreeable.</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="143"/>Not long after this, Lucinda took leave when they had got upon the terrace, and were near home. Before they entered, George addressed his sister, as he always called her, asking why she seemed so angry with him? Certainly you cannot be offended, said he, that Lucinda had her share of the apples? You know very well, I have always loved you most, and would have shewn it in the tree, by throwing you the finest apples; but I know not how it chanced, my dear, they fell into Miss Lucinda's apron. Could I take them from her? Ask yourself that question. And besides, I thought you far more generous than to take offence at such a trifle! You shall see, the very first occasion that presents itself of showing you my real senti∣ments, it was not my design to vex you.</P>
<P>Hey-dey, Mr. George! said Cecilia, and who told you that I was vexed? Suppose Miss Lucinda's apples had been even ten times finer than what I had, is that any thing to me? I am no glutton, and you know that very well, sir; neither should I in the least have minded it, but for the saucy little creature's looks. I'll not endure them, that I won't; and as for you, fall down upon your knees this instant, or I will never, while I live, forgive you.</P>
<P>O! I cannot do that by any means, said George, (bend∣ing half his body backwards as he spoke) for by doing so, I should confess a fault with which you have no right to charge me. I am no story-teller, and must say, it is very wrong in you, Miss Cecilia, if you will not believe that I did not mean to vex you.</P>
<P>Very wrong in me! replied the other. Very wrong in me! What do you mean, sir? But I see why you affront me thus; it is because Miss Lucinda is your favourite. And so saying, and bestowing a contemptuous curtsy on him, while she looked another way, she went into the house in a pet.</P>
<P>As dinner was now ready, they sat down, but pouted at each other all the time it lasted. Cecilia did not drink even once, because she must have said, <HI>Your good health, George.</HI> And George, on his part, was so piqued at her injustice, that he also thought proper to preserve his dig∣nity. And yet, the little lady would steal a glance still, every now and then at George, and from a corner of her eye, consider all his motions. As it happened, one of
<PB N="132" REF="144"/>these sly glances met with one of George's, who was no less slily studying Cecilia's motions. Being thus sur∣prised, she turned immediately towards another object; and as George took this to proceed from disdain, though in reality it did not, he affected great indifference, and went on eating, just as if he did not care a farthing for her.</P>
<P>When the cloth was removed, and the wine and sruit brought in, unluckily poor Cecilia, mortified as she was at George's whole behaviour, replied a little disrespect∣fully to her mama, (who had besides been obliged to ask her the question twice over,) and she was therefore ordered instantly from table. She obeyed, and bursting out into a flood of tears, withdrew, as if she knew not whither she was going. As the door was open that conducted to the garden, she passed out that way, and, as it were by instinct, went to hide her sorrow in an arbour at the bot∣tom of it. There, while she burst out again into a flood of tears, and sighed most lamentably, she repented of the quarrel that she had picked with George, who always used, upon such sad occasions, to alleviate her distress by weeping with her.</P>
<P>George, remaining at the table, could not think of Ce∣cilia in c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sgra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, and not feel greatly for her situation. They had har<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly let him take two peaches, before he set about contriving means to convey them into his pocket for po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r Cecilia, whom he designed afterwards to visit in the garden, upon some pretence or other, which he did not doubt but he should be able to invent, and yet he greatly appre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ended that his intention would be discovered. He pushed back his chair, and asterwards brought it forward, more than menty times, and was continually looking down for something on the carpet. Then all of a sudden; Look at pretty Laura! look at Rover! cried he, seeming to take notice of two dogs in the apartment; and at the same time he had got a peach ready to slip into his pocket, if he could but fix my lord's and lady's observation upon something at a distance from him.</P>
<P>See, papa, mama, how prettily they are playing! Do but turn about; they will make you die with laughing.</P>
<P>Oh! re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d my lord, they will not eat one another, that I will answer for; and having just glanced at them, put himself so soon into his first position, that poor George,
<PB N="133" REF="145"/>who thought himself that moment sure of pocketing the peach, was disconcerted, and obliged to put it down again upon the table.</P>
<P>Lady Eustace had observed him, and conjectured his intention; therefore, having for a while enjoyed the little boy's embarrassment, she made his lordship privy to the affair, as well as she was able, and in dumb show bade him turn his head on one side; which he did accordingly, but could not hide a smile, that notwithstanding all his gravity escaped him.</P>
<P>However, George, who thought himself as yet quite un∣discovered, but was fearful lest this device again repeated might betray him, instantly resorted to another stratagem. He took one peach, and placed it in the hollow of his hands put both together, after which he lifted it to his mouth, and made as if he had really been eating, by an imitation of the noise and motion which people make when they are chewing. Then, while with his left-hand he luckily found means to clap his peach into a cavity that he had hollowed beforehand in the napkin on his knees, he put his right-hand out to take the other, which he served exactly in the same manner.</P>
<P>Some few minutes had now passed, and as it happened, my lord and lady had quite forgot little George, and were conversing with each other in their usual manner; so that George, supposing this a proper opportunity to get away, rose up from table, with both peaches in the napkin, and began to imi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>te the mewing of a cat, which a young shepherd boy had lately taught him; and his view in this was to engage the attention both of Pompey and Rover, which he did, and put them into motion. Lady Eustace, somewhat angry at these mewings, inter∣rupted him. "What now!" said she; and added, "Well, but George, if our discourse displeases you, I fancy, you may go and mew a little in the garden." George put on a feigned embarrassment at this reproof, which was another thing that he wanted. He runs up therefore to Laura, saying, "See, mama she wants to bite poor Rover!" and in turning, he dexteroussy whipped the napkin all at once into his pocket, and pretended to run after Laura, with an intent to punish her. Laura scampered towards the door which Cecilia had left
<PB N="134" REF="146"/>open, when she went into the garden, and away went Master George, pursuing him.</P>
<P>"George! George! said Lady Eustace; pray, where are you going?" George stopped short. "My dear mama, said he, I will take a turn, if you please, in the garden. Won't you let me? I am sure you will give me leave." But afterwards, as her ladyship returned no an∣swer, he lowered his voice, and in a suppliant manner added, "Pray, my dear mama, do let me! You shall see how well I will behave myself." "In that case, an∣swered she, I will give you leave. Go."</P>
<P>What words can express the greatness of his joy! He was so joyful, that not minding how he ran, his foot slip∣ped and he fell down. By great good luck, the peaches were not damaged in the fall. He got up again instantly, and ran to seek his sister in every nook and corner of the garden.</P>
<P>George was got by this time to the arbour, where he saw poor Cecilia wonderfully changed, and in an attitude of sorrow and repentance. She was now exceedingly un∣happy. She had grieved the three best friends that she had; her worthy parents, and her own dear George.</P>
<P>"My sweetest Cecilia!" said George, and fell down on his knees before her. "Let us be friends: I would freely ask forgiveness for my fault, if I had really in∣tended to displease you. Yet, if you will ask my pardon, I will ask yours also. Will you? Come, forgive, Cecilia; let us be friends again. Here, here are two nice peaches: I could not think of tasting them, as you were not to have your share."</P>
<P>"Ah! my dearest George! (said Cecilia, squeezing his hand wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> she spoke, and weeping on his shoulder,) what a good, sweet-tempered little fellow I have always found you! C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inly, (continued she, and sobbed while she spoke,) certainly a friend in one's misfortunes is a real friend indeed. But I will not take your peaches. It would have been pitiful behaviour in me, had I been vexed this morning for the loss of half a dozen apples. You do not think that I was, George, do you! No, it wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the insulting look with which that pert Miss Lucinda viewed me; but I will not think about her now. Will you for∣give me? added she; and with her handkerchief wiped off the tears that she had let fall on George's hand. I
<PB N="135" REF="147"/>know, I sometimes love to plague you; but keep your peaches now, I will not eat them."</P>
<P>"Well, then, sister, answered George, whenever the fancy comes into your head, e'en plague me just as long as you think proper. Yet I will never let another do so. You understand me? But as to these two peaches, I can∣not eat them. I have told you so already, and was never guilty of a story"</P>
<P>"No, nor I, (said Cecilia, and that moment flung them both away into the public road.) I cannot endure the thoughts of having made a quarrel up for interested reasons.—But as we are now close friends again, how happy would it make me, if I could but get mama's permission to appear, and ask her pardon!"</P>
<P>"Oh! I will fly and get it for you, answered George; and hardly had pronounced the words, when he was got a good way from the arbour. I will inform mama, conti∣nued he, that it was I who made you anger her, by having vexed you in the morning."</P>
<P>In effect, he succeeded sooner than he expected.—In∣deed, what errors would not any reasonable woman over∣look, in favour of a friendship so affectionate and ge∣nerous!</P>

<HEAD>CAESAR AND POMPEY.</HEAD>
<P>MR. Saunders had brought up two handsome dogs, one Caesar and the other Pompey. He had named them so, not with the wish or expectation that they should one day become rivals, like the two illustrious commanders whose names they bore, but though both were littered at a birth, had always fed together, and been treated with an absolute equality, yet it was not long before they ma∣nifested very different tempers.</P>
<P>Caesar was extremely meek and docile; Pompey rough and quarrelsome.</P>
<P>The generous Caesar jumped for joy, when any one ca∣ressed him, and never took it ill that his brother should
<PB N="140" REF="152"/>be fondled in the same manner; but the surly Pompey, on the other hand, whenever Mr. Saunders had him in his lap, would growl if Caesar met with the least notice, the least smile, or token of affection.</P>
<P>When the friends of Mr. Saunders, coming on a visit, brought their dogs, our Caesar would immediately get in among them, and endeavour to amuse his company; and, as his nature was extremely pliant and insinuating, and his manners very winning, they were always at their ease whenever it was his part to entertain them. They would play and frisk about the apartments, just as if they had been all at school with one another. The good Caesar did his utmost to set off their beauty and activity, that Mr. Saunders might be pleased with their appearance, and induced to do them some good turn or other.</P>
<P>What did Pompey do in the mean time? He would get into a corner, and be all day barking at the strangers. If unhappily they drew too near him, he would then be sure to grin and snarl, and often bite their tails or ears. And if his master noticed any one among them for his breed∣ing and good parts, he would howl with all his might, as if the house was robbing.</P>
<P>Mr. Saunders had remarked this odious temper some time past in Pompey, and begun already to neglect him. Caesar, on the other hand, gained something every day on his affection.</P>
<P>On a certain day, as he was set at table, he resolved to try their dispositions more than he ever yet had done. They were both attending at the table, Pompey being nearest; for the honest Caesar, to avoid dissension, always gave him up with pleasure the foremost place: and Mr. Saunders held out Pompey a nice piece of juicy meat, which he immediately fell a chewing. Caesar was not dis∣contented in the least at this, but waited with the greatest good humour till his turn should come. His turn soon came; but Mr. Saunders threw him nothing but a hard dry bone. He took it without any sign of discontent; but hardly had the churlish Pompey observed Caesar busy with his share, though much inferior to his own, than he rejected with disdain the bit between his teeth, and fell on Caesar to obtain his bone. The gentle Caesar made no manner of resistance, but, imagining that it might please the fickle taste of Pompey, yielded it at once.</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="153"/>Do not think, my friends, that this condescension on the part of Caesar was the effect of cowardice, or even weak∣ness in him. He had given ample testimony of his strength and resolution very lately, in a contest where he had been engaged on account of Pompey, whose intolerable surli∣ness had drawn down upon him the resentment of a dog that lived in the neighbourhood. He had not fought above five minutes, though it was he himself who had previously provoked the fight, before he ran away; while Caesar, though without a friend to take his part, continued the engagement like a hero, and acquired at last such glory, as to make his adversary bite the dust.</P>
<P>This anecdote his master knew; and as his character for courage was so thoroughly confirmed, he made him take the bit of juicy meat that he had before thrown to Pompey, but which Pompey had rejected. "Caesar, my good fellow, said his master, it is but just that you should enjoy your brother's portion, since he first took yours; and therefore eat it."</P>
<P>Pompey scowled at Caesar, seeing the affection that ac∣companied these words in Mr. Saunders's countenance; and Mr. Saunders added, "Since you have shewn your∣self thus complaisant and generous towards him who treats you with such j<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>alousy and envy, you shall be in future my own dog, and range about the house as you think proper; but your brother shall be tied up in the yard: so quick, a chain for Pompey! and let some one bid the car∣penter this moment knock up a kennel for him." Ac∣cordingly this last was instantly conducted to his station, while the other had his liberty to walk about the apart∣ments.</P>
<P>Pompey would very probably have enjoyed with inso∣leace so great a mark of favour, had <HI>he</HI> gained the advan∣tage in his master's judgment; but the heart of Caesar bled at the idea of his brother's sentence, and he essayed all means to soften his condition. When the servants gave him any thing, he would be sure to carry it to Pompey, wag his tail with pleasure, and invite him to regale upon it; and at night he would not fail to visit Pompey in his house, amusing him in the midst of his sufferings by all possible means, and for hours together warming his be∣numbed limbs.</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="154"/>But Pompey, far from being softened by such kind actions, never welcomed Caesar to his kennel, nor receiv∣ed him otherwise than with continual howlings; so that very quickly after, rage inflamed his blood, his heart was ulcerated, and his entrails perfectly dried up.</P>
<P>You, children, who read this, if there be any one among you of a disposition such as Pompey had, consider what a miserable lot awaits you, and reflect upon his punishment. You will otherwise lead a life of sorrow and humiliation, and expire in horror.</P>

<HEAD>THE LITTLE GIRL WITH WHISKERS.</HEAD>
<P>"WON'T you do what I bid you then, Mr. Obsta∣nacy? Come, sir, obey; or else you will be the worse off for it, I can tell you." Thus Camilla, a pert little vixen of whom we are now going to give an ac∣count, was perpetually rating and commanding her poor brother.</P>
<P>Might her word be taken for it, he did every thing amiss: on the contrary, whatever she thought of doing, was a master piece of reason and reflexion. The diversions that he proposed were always dull and heavy in her judg∣ment; but forgetting this decision, when the next day came, she would most probably chuse them herself, as the liveliest and most entertaining. Her unhappy brother was obliged, on pain of being soundly lectured, to obey her whims and fancies. If he durst attempt to shew her the unreasonableness of her procedure, she would be that mo∣ment in her airs; his play things then were sure to go to ruin, and himself was forced to mope, without amusement, in a corner of the room.</P>
<P>Camilla's parents had a hundred times endeavoared to break her of this fault. Her mother in particular, was always telling her that people never gained the love of others, if they were not complaisant and gentle; that a little girl, who would on all occasions set up her own will by way of law for others, would be found the most intole∣rable creature in the universe. These prudent lessons, or instructions, made no manner of impression on her heart. Her brother, sick of so much tyranny, began already to
<PB N="143" REF="155"/>lose something of his love and kindness for her; and Camilla was so far from shaking off her domineering dispo∣sition on that account, that she became a hundred times more arbitrary and insulting.</P>
<P>As it chanced, a gentleman of understanding, and who was always remarkably sincere and open in his speech and conduct, dined one day, upon an invitation, with Ca∣milla's parents. He observed with what a haughty air she treated her poor little brother, nay, and every body in the room. At first through mere politeness, he kept silence; but, tired out ere long with her impertinence, he began, addressing his discourse to Mrs. Fleming, her mama, as follows: "Had I such a little girl as yours, I know what I would do."</P>
<P>What, sir? said Mrs. Fleming.</P>
<P>You shall hear, replied the gentleman. I am lately come from France, and, as I liked to see the soldiers exercise, I amused myself, by visiting the grand parade where the soldiers are drawn up, as frequently as I had leisure. Among the soldiers, there were many that I ob∣served with whiskers; and, one cannot but acknowledge, they looked very fierce, as soldiers should. Now, had I a child like your Camilla, I would give her instantly a sol∣dier's uniform, and I would clap a pair of whiskers on her, and make her a Swiss Corporal, so that she might com∣pletely satisfy her passion for commanding.</P>
<P>Hearing this, Camilla stood confounded. She could not refrain from blushing, and even wept.</P>
<P>From that time forward, she was sensible how much a tyranizing disposition misbecame her, and resolved to shun the mortifying consequences which it would soon or late bring down upon her. This resolution, assisted by the prudent counsels of her mother, quickly proved success∣ful.</P>
<P>Such a change was doubtless very prudent on her part. It were however to be wished, for all young ladies la∣bouring under such a fault, that they would yield obe∣dience to the kind instruction of their parents on this sub∣ject; and not wait till such time as a man of understanding tells them, to their face, that they would look better in a surly soldier's uniform, with whiskers, than set off with nice white cambrick frocks, like all good-natured little ladies.</P>

<HEAD>THE SCAR.</HEAD>
<P>FERDINAND, from nature, had received a soul endued with elevated thoughts and generous notions. He possessed a lively turn of mind, a strong and quick imagination, with a chearful temper. His whole person in a word, and his polite behaviour, won him every heart.</P>
<P>However, with so many amiable qualities, he had a certain great defect, extremely inconvenient to his friends, of giving way to every slight impression, and yielding up his soul to the emotions which any accidental circumstance might raise within him.</P>
<P>When he sought amusement in the circle of his play∣mates, trifling contradictions ruffled his impatient disposi∣tion, and they saw the fire of rage in a moment inflame his whole countenance; he stamped upon the ground, cried out, and was beside himself with passion.</P>
<P>Once upon a time, as he was walking in his chamber to and fro, and meditating on the necessary preparations for a treat which his father had permitted him to give his sister, Marcian, his dear friend and favourite, intended to communicate his notions on the subject. Buried as he was in thought, he saw not Marcian. Marcian, therefore, having called out to him, but in vain, drew nearer, and began to pull him by the sleeve; but Ferdinand, disturbed and out of patience with these interruptions, unexpectedly turned round, with so much rudeness, that he sent poor Marcian quite across the apartment to fall down beside the wainscot.</P>
<P>Marcian, after he dropped, lay still without the least appearance of life. To which I am to add, that, in fall∣ing, he had siruck his head against the moulding of a book-case, and received a wound, as Ferdinand then fancied, in the temple, whence there came a deal of blood.</P>
<P>Heavens! reader, what a shocking prospect was this for Ferdinand! who never had intended any harm to Marcian; and for whom he would have even lost his life, if there had been occasion.</P>
<P>Ferdinand fell down beside him, lamentably crying out, He is dead, he is dead! I have killed my friend! Instead
<PB N="145" REF="157"/>of trying any means for his recovery, he remained stretch∣ed all along, uttering dismal groans. Happily, his father heard him; he came running up, took Marcian in his arms, and having laid him on a bed, called out for salts, and threw cold water in his face, which recovered him a little.</P>
<P>The return of Marcian to new life, transported Ferdi∣nand with joy; but, as he might relapse, it was not great enough to take away entirely his anxiety.</P>
<P>A surgeon, being sent for, probed the wound. He found it to be not in the temple, but so very near it, that the difference of a hair's breadth in its position would have made it dangerous indeed, if not quite mortal. Being carried home, he soon became delirious.</P>
<P>Ferdinand could by no means be persuaded to leave Marcian. He took up his station by his dear friend's pillow, and maintained the profoundest silence; Marcian frequent∣ly pronounced the name of Ferdinand, while his delirium lasted. My dear Ferdinand, he would say, in what had I offended you, that I should be treated thus? Yet, it is quite impossible that you should be less afflicted than my∣self, for having wounded me, without the least degree of provocation. Let it not, however, grieve your generous nature. I forgive you, and do you forgive me likewise, Ferdinand, for having put you, as I must have done, into a passion. It was not my wish to vex you.</P>
<P>This discourse which Marcian thus addressed to Ferdi∣nand, without observing him, though present, and even holding him continually by the hand, redoubled his afflic∣tion. Every word proceeding from the lips of Marcian, as it served but to proclaim the greatness of his friendship, was a poignard to the heart of Ferdinand.</P>
<P>At last, however, it pleased God, for Ferdinand's great consolation, to assuage the violence of the fever. In ten days time the patient was enabled to get up.</P>
<P>What tongue can represent the joy of Ferdinand! It is not to be comprehended certainly by any one, unless he himself has felt beforehand, the sorrow which Ferdinand experienced all the while that he was a witness of his friend's distressful situation.</P>
<P>Marcian being at last thoroughly recovered, Ferdinand resumed his former chearful humour, and not needing any other lesson than the sorrowful event that had so late y
<PB N="146" REF="158"/>happened, he laboured hard to overcome the vehemence of temper to which he had been a slave.</P>
<P>Marcian in a very little time had no mark of the acci∣dent remaining, but a trifling scar, as just now mention∣ed, near the temple. Ferdinand could never see this scar without emotion, even when they were both come to years of manhood. It became, in short, the seal of that much closer friendship in which they were ever afterwards mutu∣ally united.</P>

<HEAD>THE SILK SLIP.</HEAD>
<P>LITTLE Matilda had worn nothing but a plain white frock, till she was eight years old. Neat red Morocco shoes, with silver buckles, set off her small feet; her ebon hair, which had never yet felt the torturing iron, floated in large curls upon her shoulders.</P>
<P>She had been one day in the company of certain little girls, who, though not older than herself, were dressed already like great ladies; and the richness of their cloaths awakened in her heart the first vain notions that she had ever had within it.</P>
<P>Dear mama, said she, returning from the house where she had met with these fine ladies, I have seen this after∣noon the three Miss Flowerdales. I suppose, you know them. The eldest of them must be younger than myself. O dear mama, how sweetly they were dressed! Their pa∣rents, sure, must have a deal of pleasure, seeing them so fine! I dare say, they are not so rich as you; so give me, if you please, a fine silk slip, with such embroidered shoes as they had on; and let my hair be dressed by Mr. Frizzle, who, they tell me, is extremely clever.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>The Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>I desire no better, if to do so will contri∣bute to your satisfaction; but I fear, with all this elegance, you will find yourself not quite so happy as you have been hitherto, in the simplicity of such plain things as you ge∣nerally wore.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matilda.</SPEAKER>
<P>And why so mama?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>The Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because you will be eternally afraid of spot∣ting, and even of rumpling what you wear. A dress so
<PB N="147" REF="159"/>elegant as that of the Miss Flowerdale's will require the greatest care and attention in the wear, that it may do you honour. If it gets one spot, the beauty will be lost for ever, as one cannot put it in the wash-tub to recover its first lustre; and however rich you may suppose me, I shall not be rich enough to let you have a new silk slip whenever you may want one.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matilda.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! if that be all mama, do not make your∣self uneasy. I will be very careful of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>The Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>Will you? Well then, I must give you such a dress; but still, remember that I have hinted what uneasiness your vanity may cause you.</P>
</SP>
<P>Unpersuaded by the wisdom of this counsel, Matilda did not lose a moment in destroying all the pleasure and enjoyment of her infancy. Her hair, which had till then hung down at liberty, was now to be confined in paper, and squeezed close between a burning hot pair of tongs; and that fine jet, which had till now so happily set off the whiteness of her forehead, was to disappear beneath a clot of powder and pomatum.</P>
<P>Two days after, Matilda had a handsome slip brought home, of pea-green taffety with fine pink trimmings, and a pair of straw-worked shoes to match them. The taste that appeared in her cloaths, their vivid colour and elegance of make—charmed the eye; but when she had them on, it was evident that her limbs were under great constraint; her motions had no longer their accustomed ease and free∣dom; and her infant countenance, amidst so vast a quanti∣ty of flowers, silk, gauze, and ribbands, lost entirely every trace of ingenuous simplicity.</P>
<P>She was, notwithstanding, quite enchanted at her me∣tamorphosis. Her eyes, with mighty satisfaction, wan∣dered over her whole little person, and were never taken off, except when she looked round about her, to find out some glass in the apartment that might represent before her, at full length, the idol which she then worshipped.</P>
<P>She had wrought on her mama to send out cards of invitation to her little friends, that when they came to visit her she might enjoy a feast, in viewing their surprise and admiration. When they had all met together, she walked to and fro before them, like a peacock; and from her behaviour, any one would have imagined that she
<PB N="148" REF="160"/>supposed herself an empress, and considered those about her as subjected to her empire. But, alas! this triumph was but of a very short duration, and a multitude of mor∣tifying circumstances followed it.</P>
<P>The children were permitted to go out a walking in the fields, near that part of the town where she lived. Ma∣tilda therefore led the way, and they reached, in ten or fifteen minutes, a delightful country.</P>
<P>A luxuriant meadow first of all attracted their attention. It was every where enamelled with a vast variety of charm∣ing flowers, and butterflies whose wings were of a thou∣sand mingled colours, hovered in each quarter of it. The gay little ladies hunted these fine butterflies; they dex∣trously caught, but did not hurt them; and when once they had examined all their beauty, let them go, and with their eyes pursued the little creatures as they flut∣tered to and fro. They employed themselves in making nosegays likewise of the flowers that sprung up in the meadow, which they gathered for that purpose.</P>
<P>Matilda, who from pride had first of all disdained these mean amusements, wanted very soon to share the enter∣tainment that they afforded; but the ground, they told her, might be damp, in which case she would stain her shoes, and damage her fine slip; for they had now disco∣vered that her intention, in thus bringing them together, was to vex them only with a sight of her fine clothes, and they resolved to mortify her in their turn.</P>
<P>She was of course obliged to be solitary, and sit still; while she observed the sprightly chearfulness of her com∣panions who sported round about her. The delight of contemplating on her pea-green slip was, compared there∣to, a very sorry kind of entertainment.</P>
<P>At the corner of the meadow there was a sort of little grove, in which was to be heard the music of a thousand birds, that seemed as if inviting every person who went through the meadow, to go thither, and enjoy the cool∣ness of the shade. This grove our children entered, jump∣ing as they went along with joy. Poor Matilda would have followed them, but she was told that the bushes would tear all her finery to pieces. She observed her friends to divert themselves at <HI>pussey in the corner,</HI> and pursue each other through the trees. The more she heard
<PB N="149" REF="161"/>them shout with joy, the more, as any one might have expected, she was peevish and ill-humoured.</P>
<P>But the youngest of her visitors had some sort of com∣passion on her. She had just found out a corner where there grew a quantity of fine wild strawberries, and there∣fore beckoned to her to come and eat part of them. She would willingly have done so, but had scarcely got into the grove, when unexpectedly a loud cry was heard. The children gathered to the spot, and found poor Matilda fastened by the gauze upon her hat and ribbands, to a branch of white thorn from which she could not by any means disengage herself. They made haste to loose the pins that held her hat on; but to add to her affliction, as her hair, which had been frizzed with so much labour, was likewise entangled with the branch of white thorn, it cost her almost a whole lock before she could be set at liberty; and thus all at once the charming superstructure of her head-dress was absolutely pulled to pieces.</P>
<P>'Tis not difficult to guess how little this misfortune thus befalling Matilda touched her play-mates, when they found, as we have said already, why she had invited them. Instead of consolation, which she needed, and perhaps expected, they could hardly keep from laughing at her comical appearance, and did actually jeer her with a hundred wicked witticisms. After having smoothed her down a little, they ran off in search of fresh amusement, towards a hill that they saw at some small distance from them.</P>
<P>Matilda however could not, without very great diffi∣culty, reach this hill. Her strait shoes, which had been made so to set off her little feet the better, were a great obstruction to her speed; nor was this all the mischief, for her stays were drawn so close that she could not easily fetch breath. She would have now been happy to go home and change her dress, in order to be at ease; but then she knew that her little friends would never have consented, upon her account, to be deprived of their amusement.</P>
<P>They had got by this time to the summit of the hill, and were enjoying the fine view which a spacious horizon presented them on every side. They saw on one hand verdant meadows; on the other, yellow harvests; before
<PB N="150" REF="162"/>them rivulets meandering through the country; and by way of termination to the landscape, a large river, on whose banks were many pleasant country houses. So magnificent a prospect charmed them. They even danced about with joy, while Matilda at the bottom of the hill, (for she was absolutely out of breath, and could not pos∣sibly get further,) was devoured with sorrow.</P>
<P>She had time and opportunity enough, in such a situa∣tion, to make many sad reflexions. To what purpose, said she to herself, are these fine clothes! how much plea∣sure do they not prevent me from enjoying! and what pain do I not suffer, merely from having put them on!</P>
<P>She was giving up her mind to these afflicting thoughts, when suddenly she heard her friends come running down the hill, and all cry out together, as they passed her, Run, run, Matilda, there is a dreadful storm behind the hill; it is coming towards us! if you do not make haste, your slip will soon be wet quite through!</P>
<P>Matilda felt her strength returning, at the fear of such a great misfortune as her play-mates threatened. She for∣got her weariness, her pinched feet, and her tight lacing, and made tolerable haste to reach some place of shelter. But in spite of all her efforts to shun so grievous a misfor∣tune as the spoiling of her clothes, she could not run so fast as her companions, who were lightly dressed. Then, too, every moment she was stopped, at one time, by her hoop and flounces in the narrow paths by which she was obliged to go; at another, by her train which was fre∣quently caught fast by the furze; and at others by the fine seaffold work about her head, on which the wind bent down the branches of those trees, under which she was forced to pass in her way homeward.</P>
<P>At that moment too the storm burst forth in all its fury; and there fell a shower of hail and rain mixed together, after all but Matilda had regained their several habitations.</P>
<P>In the end, however, Matilda got home likewise, but wet through and through. She had besides left one of her fine shoes behind her in a heap of dung, which as she hurried homeward, she had scrambled over without seeing it; and to increase the list of her disasters, she had not
<PB N="151" REF="163"/>quite cleared the meadow, when a gust of wind blew off her hat into the middle of a dirty pool of water.</P>
<P>They had all the trouble that one can possibly imagine to undress her; so much had the sweat and rain even glued her shift and other garments to her body; so that her whole dress was spoiled, and absolutely good for nothing.</P>
<P>Shall I have another slip, my dear, made up for you against to-morrow? said her mother drily, seeing her in tears.</P>
<P>O no, mama, said Matilda, kissng her: I am con∣vinced, fine clothes can never make the wearer of them happy. Let me take up with my nice white frock again; and have no more pomatum in my hair, till I am eight or ten years older than at present; and forgive my folly.</P>
<P>Matilda, with the dress of childhood, came again into the full possession of her liberty, and seemed as modest and as charming as she had ever been. Neither did her dear mama regret the loss that she had experienced in the pur∣chase of this fine silk slip, &amp;c. since it proved the means of reinstating her beloved daughter in the happiness which her vanity and folly would have taken from her, had it not been for this useful lesson.</P>

<P>O Heaven! O Heaven! all burning still! What vo∣lumes of thick smoke and flame! What is now be∣come of my papa, mama and sister? Am I an unhappy orphan? Heaven take pity on me, and let them be safe; for they are more to me than all the world beside—With∣out them what should I do?

<P>Why did not you answer, when I called you?</P>

<P>Have you been calling me? I did not hear you. I was listening to this poor boy here.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sukey.</SPEAKER>
<P>Poor! What has happened to him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lubbin.</SPEAKER>
<P>He was like to have been burnt alive. His house was all in flames, he tells me, when they got him out.</P>

<P>How pale the poor child is! And how did they contrive to save you, my little master?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Adrian.</SPEAKER>
<P>Our helper was bid to take me to the village where I had been nursed; so he put me on his shoulders; but they stopped him in the street, wanting hands to work. I fell a crying, when I saw myself alone; at which, a good old woman took me by the hand, and brought me out of town, directing me to walk strait
<PB N="154" REF="166"/>forward, till I saw a village; so I followed her advice, and here I am.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jane.</SPEAKER>
<P>And can you tell me what your nurse's name was?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Adrian.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, not now; but I can recollect I used to call my little foster-sister, Sukey.</P>

<SPEAKER>Jane, </SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(kissing Adrian.)</STAGE>
<P>How happy am I now! I thought of nothing but my poor dear little Adrian, since this fire began. My husband is gone to give you all the assistance that he can.—But how tall he is grown! should you have recollected him! I think not, Sukey.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sakey.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not in mediately, indeed; but when I saw him first, methought I felt my heart beat towards him. It is a long time now since we were last together.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Adrian.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have been a great way off, at school, and came home only three days since, for the holidays. Had I remained at school, I should, at least at present, have known nothing of this day's misfortune. O, papa! mama! O sister!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jane.</SPEAKER>
<P>Poor dear child! there is no cause to make your∣self uneasy. On the first alarm of fire, so near your quarter of the town, my husband instantly set out, to see if he could be of any use. I know him. Your papa, mama, and sister, will be safe, if mortal man can save them. But, my lovely Adrian, you have been up and running these two hours at least, and must be hungry. Will you eat a little?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lubbin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Look ye, master, here is a Yorkshire cake and butter. Take it!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Adrian.</SPEAKER>
<P>Master! You were used to call me Adrian, and not master.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lubbin, </SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(embracing him.)</STAGE>
<P>Well then, Adrian, take my breakfast.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sukey.</SPEAKER>
<P>Or stay, Adrian, you must certainly be dry as well as hungry. I will go fetch my milk pottage. I was putting in the bread—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="155" REF="167"/>
<SPEAKER>Adrian.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, my good friends. I cannot have any appetite, till I see my dear papa, mama, and sister. I will return and seek them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jane.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you think of what you are saying? Run into the flames!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Adrian.</SPEAKER>
<P>I left them in the flames; but it was against my will. I did not like to part with them, but my papa would have it so: he threatened me, and in an angry tone bid Gilbert pay no heed to my resistance. I was forced at last to yield, for fear of putting him into a greater passion. I cannot hold out any longer, but, whatever be the danger, I must go back to find if they are in safety.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jane.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot let you go, that is certain. Come into the house with us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Adrian.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have a house then. Alas! I have none.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jane.</SPEAKER>
<P>And is not our house your's? I fed you with my milk, and surely then I cannot deny you bread.
<STAGE>(She forces him in, and says to Lubbin)</STAGE> Take care, and stay you here, that you may see your father the sooner, and let us know of his coming.—But do not run to see the fire. Remember, I forbid you that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lubbin, </SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(alone.)</STAGE>
<P>And yet I have half a mind to do so. What a charming bonfire it must make! I do not see clearly, but I think that steeple is down, that had the golden dragon on the top. There is many a poor soul, by this, burnt out of house and home! I pity them, and yet they must not hinder me from finishing my breakfast. — <STAGE>(To Sukey, who re-enters with a tumbler)</STAGE> Well now, sister, you are a dear good girl, indeed, to bring me drink so kindly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sukey.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! it is not for you. I am come to get a glass of water for poor Adrian. He will have neither milk, nor ale, nor wine. "My dear papa, (says he,) mama, and sister, very likely, are at present dry and hangry, and shall I have such nice things? No, no, indeed: let me have therefore nothing but a little water; that will serve me well enough, especially as I am so thirsty."</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lubbin.</SPEAKER>
<P>One must own, however, it is something comical, that Adrian should refuse a drop of any thing that is good, because he cannot get tidings of his parents.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sukey.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! I know you well enough! Your sister might be burnt alive, and you not eat a mouthful less on that
<PB N="156" REF="168"/>account. For my part, I should be like Adrian: I should hardly think of eating, if our house were set on fire, and no one could inform me what had happened to my father, mother, or even brother.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lubbin.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, nor I—provided I were not hungry.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sukey.</SPEAKER>
<P>Can one then be hungry in such a case? Look ye, Lubbin, I have not the least degree of appetite. To see poor Adrian weep, and take on so, has made me quite forget my hunger.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lubbin.</SPEAKER>
<P>So you won't eat your milk-pottage this morning?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sukey.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, you want it, after having swallowed your own breakfast, with Yorkshire cake into the bar∣gain?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lubbin.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; I would only take your breakfast, that, if neither you nor Adrian wished to have it, nothing might be loft; that is all. But let me have the tumbler: I have not drunk any thing yet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sukey, </SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(giving him the tumbler.)</STAGE>
<P>Make haste then! Adrian is very dry.</P>

<P>Do you suppose then that I have poison in my mouth?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sukey.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very proper, truly, with the crumbs about the rim! I will rince it out myself. Young gentlemen are used to cleanliness, and I should wish to let him see as much propriety and neatness in our cottage, as at home.

<P>So, there is my breakfast done. Sup∣pose now that I should run to town, and see the fire.

It is not more than twelve or thirteen minutes' walk before I am there.— Come, come; faint heart, the proverb tells us, never won fair lady.

<P>Over, Jane! the whole street is in flames. If you could only see the ruins, and the multitude of people! Women with their hair about their ears, all run∣ning
<PB N="158" REF="170"/>to and fro, and calling out to find their husbands and poor children; to which add the found of bells, the noise of carts and engines, with the crush of houses when the timbers are burnt through, the frightened horses, and the throng of people driving full against you. I cannot tell you how I made my way amidst the flames that crossed before me, and the burning beams that seemed ready every moment to fall down and crush me.</P>

<SPEAKER>Jane.</SPEAKER>

<P>And see my arm too. But why should I complain? Could I have only got away with life, I should not have mattered losing a limb for Mr. Creswell.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jane.</SPEAKER>
<P>How, my dear, a limb?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trueman.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, wife, to save our benefactor! Was it not through his means that we both came together? Are we not indebted to his generosity, not only for this farm, but for every thing? And what is still more, my jewel, was it not your milk that reared his weakly child, now so strong and hearty?
<STAGE>(Adrian clings to Jane.)</STAGE> Did I say that I should not have mattered losing a limb for Mr. Creswell? —I say more: I would have given my life to save him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jane.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you have been able to assist him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trueman.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I have that happiness to boast. He himself, his lady, and his daughter, had scarce got out of their house, as they supposed in safety, when a half-burnt beam fell down into the street before them. Happily, I was not ten yards off: the people fancied that they were crushed beneath its weight, and ran away. I heard their cries, came back, and rushing through the burning ruins, brought them off. I had already saved this chest that you see here, and my cart, besides, is loaded with the greatest part of their most valuable furniture.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Adrian.</SPEAKER>
<P>Be sure, my father will most richly recom∣pense you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trueman.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am recompensed already, my dear little friend! Your father did not perhaps expect such a service at my hands, and I have saved him. In that thought, I am much better paid than in receiving any recompense. But this is not the whole: I dare say he will be here pre∣sently, and all his family and people.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Adrian.</SPEAKER>
<P>What then, shall I see them soon?</P>

<SPEAKER>Trueman.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, my Adrian. But run, wife, and make a little preparation to receive them: let some ale be drawn, and have the cows milked instantly. Air sheets to put on all our beds; and as for us, we will take up our lodging in the stable.</P>
</SP>

<P>Be it so. I will play my part, I warrant you.</P>

<P>And I will go put the hay up in some kind of order in the barn, and make a little room for those who may come hither requiring some shelter. All the fields, alas! are covered with them. I imagine, I still see them! some struck speechless, gaze with absolute insensibility, while they behold their houses burning, or else fall down on the ground, fatigued and frightened! others run along like madmen, wring their hands, or pull their hair up by the roots, and uttering fearful cries, attempt to force their passage through a line of soldiers, who with bayonets keep them off, that they may save the property of the sufferers from being plundered.</P>

Thank God! I am not so poor, that any one applying to my charity should die for want of food. If I had nothing else, I would give them my last bit of bread.

<P>Well, now I must contrive to do all this myself; and when we love each other, it is exactly the same thing.

<HEAD>THE GREAT GARDEN.</HEAD>
<P>MR. Sage had received no very great inheritance from fortune and his parents, but was not without the happy secret of limiting his desires to what he possessed; and notwithstanding he was frequently obliged to go without a number of conveniencies and comforts which others could command by means of their abundance, never did one envious thought disturb his equability of temper. He had never suffered more than one affliction of consi∣derable magnitude, arising from his want of this life's comforts; and that was the loss of an affectionate and virtuous woman, torn from his embraces by the hand of death. A charming little fellow, Polydore Sage, was the only child remaining to console him; and the educa∣tion of this charming little fellow, was the single object of his study and attention.</P>
<P>Polydore was endued by nature with very strong imagi∣nation; and by this, his father had found out the happy secret of improving his reason, at a very early time of life; namely, by exhibiting before him every object in its real point of view, of which he had beforehand only given him an idea. By a series of strong images, arranged in order, and selected in a proper moment to produce their full effect, he had enabled him already to make many ac∣curate and deep reflexions.</P>
<P>Satisfied with his condition, this good father wished particularly to inculcate in his son those principles to which he owed himself the calm of his condition, and the peace within his mind. Yes, often would he whisper to himself, if I can but accustom him to live contented with his humble fortune, and point out to him the folly of putting any value upon what he must not hope to obtain, I shall contribute more to make his manhood happy, than by leaving him a heap of gold and silver.</P>
<P>Occupied incessantly on this important lesson, he thought fit one evening to accompany his son to Vauxhall Gardens, for the first time in his life. Immediately on entering, Polydore was struck with admiration and de∣light. The perfume of the flowers, the beauty of the paintings, the well-ordered disposition of the walks, the
<PB N="168" REF="180"/>crowd of men and women who were in them, elegantly dressed, the incessant motion of the multitude, the hum of their discourse, the noise of the cascade, all joined to attract his contemplation; and his eye considered at one view ten thousand objects. His good father seeing him, if we may say so, swallowed up in thought, conducted him to that part of the gardens which was more retired from public observation; that his senses, which were too much occupied by such a crowd of images, might be in some degree at rest. Soon after, he proposed indulging him with some refreshment, if he liked it.—Polydore gladly took his father's offer; and soon after, having satis∣fied his appetite and palate, spoke as follows:</P>
<P>How extremely happy every one here present seems to be! I should like, papa, if we had such a charming gar∣den. Did you notice what a number of fine carriages were at the door? And all those gentlefolks that pass us, how well dressed they are! I should be glad to know why we must live so savingly, when others in the world indulge themselves with every thing that they fancy. I begin, papa, believe me, now to see how poor you are. But why, then, are so many around us rich? They are not better people sure than you, papa.</P>
<P>You speak exactly like a child, replied the father. <HI>You begin to see how poor I am?</HI> Now I can tell you, I am quite rich.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polydore.</SPEAKER>
<P>And where, then, are your riches?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sage.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have a garden bigger by far than this.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polydore.</SPEAKER>
<P>A garden? You, papa! I should be glad to see it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sage.</SPEAKER>
<P>When we go into the country, you shall see it.</P>
<P>They went very soon, it being now the season for taking the pleasures of the country, and on the very day of their arrival at the country-house, not far from London, Mr. Sage took his son and led him up a hill, from whence the eye commanded an extensive prospect. On the right, was seen a spacious forest, whose extremities seemed lost at the horizon. On the left, appeared a beauteous mixture of fine gardens, verdant meadows, and vast fields quite covered with the promise of a plenteous harvest. Close below the hill was stretched a valley, watered in its whole extent with a thousand little rills;
<PB N="169" REF="181"/>and all this landscape was in motion. There were fisher∣men in one part, busy with their nets; and husbandmen, who in another were employed in gathering fruits and herbs, and sportsmen with their greyhounds urging the swift stag, and shepherds watching by their flocks, or playing near them in the shade; and reapers carting their last sheaves, and dancing all the way before them as they proceeded homeward. This delightful picture captivated Mr. Sage and his son, who for a time kept silence, till the child began the following conversation:</P>
<P>Papa, when shall we reach your garden?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sage.</SPEAKER>
<P>We are at it now, my child.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polydore.</SPEAKER>
<P>But this is not a garden: it is a hill.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sage.</SPEAKER>
<P>Look round as far as you can see; for this, I tell you, is my garden. Yonder forest, and these fields are all my property.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polydore.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your property, papa? You are joking!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sage.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, indeed, I am not. I will convince you in an instant that I dispose of every thing all around us as the owner of it only can do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polydore.</SPEAKER>
<P>It will delight me to be sure of that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sage.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you had all this country, what would you do with it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polydore.</SPEAKER>
<P>What the owners of estates generally do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sage.</SPEAKER>
<P>What may that be?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polydore.</SPEAKER>
<P>In the first place, then, I would cut down a deal of timber, and make fire-wood of it, to be used this winter. In the next place, I would go a hunting to catch venison; and sometimes I would fish. I would breed sheep, and oxen; and in harvest, gather in the corn that covers this fine country.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sage.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, you comprehend the matter admi∣rably, Polydore: and I am glad to find our notions are so like each other's. Well, whatever you would do, then, I already do; and I will convince you of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polydore.</SPEAKER>
<P>How, papa?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sage.</SPEAKER>
<P>I say, then, in the first place, I have men who cut down for me in this forest all the wood that I want.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polydore.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet, I never heard you order them to cut down any for you!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sage.</SPEAKER>
<P>And why not? because they have the fore∣thought to prevent me. We have always a good fire
<PB N="170" REF="182"/>below, and sometimes, too, up stairs. Well then, I have the wood brought to me from the forest to keep up those fires: for here, you know, we cannot get coals to burn as if we were in London.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polydore.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have, indeed, the wood brought to you from this forest; but must pay for what you have.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sage.</SPEAKER>
<P>If I were what you call the real owner of this forest, should I not be forced, as I am at present, to pay for what I might have brought me from it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polydore.</SPEAKER>
<P>No indeed, papa. It would be cut down for you, and sent in without a penny cost on your part.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sage.</SPEAKER>
<P>You believe so, do you? On the contrary, I think the cost might be a great deal more in that case than at present; for you will grant, if I possessed the forest, I must keep at least a woodman to cut down the trees for fire-wood.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polydore.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well; pass over this: but can you go a hunt∣ing?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sage.</SPEAKER>
<P>And why should I hunt, Polydore?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polydore.</SPEAKER>
<P>For instance, to have venison.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sage.</SPEAKER>
<P>Could we two, then, eat a buck or doe our∣selves entirely?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polydore.</SPEAKER>
<P>We should have a charming appetite to do so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sage.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then, as I cannot go a hunting, I send huntsmen in my place; and very probably, the venison that you have seen hang up at Charing-cross, where, as you remember, you went with me lately to buy some, was hunted in this forest. I can therefore, without hunting venison, have as much as I think proper.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polydore.</SPEAKER>
<P>For your money!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sage.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well; and is it not a charming thing for me that I can come at venison on these terms? for I have no wages to pay to those who hunt it for me; or provided they should shoot it, I have neither to supply them with gun, nor ball nor powder. Those various kinds of dogs that our squire maintains, thank Heaven! they eat up nothing that belongs to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polydore.</SPEAKER>
<P>Are those cows too, and sheep that graze in yonder meadow, yours?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sage.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, truly. Have not you fresh butter every day? I get it from those cows.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polydore.</SPEAKER>
<P>But papa, if all these flocks, and all those little rivers too, are yours, why have not we at dinner
<PB N="171" REF="183"/>every day all sorts of meat and fish, as other rich folks I am told have?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sage.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do they eat up every thing that their servants set before them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polydore.</SPEAKER>
<P>No: but they may chuse at table whatever they like.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sage.</SPEAKER>
<P>And as for me, I make my choice before my victuals come to table. Every thing that I want, I have. Superfluous things, it is true, I do not possess; but what benefit would they procure me if I had them? I should want, in that case, a superfluous stomach also.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polydore.</SPEAKER>
<P>Wealthy people make good cheer; but you, papa, I fancy, do not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sage.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed I do, and better than the wealthy, Polydore. I have a sauce that almost always fails them; namely, a good appetite.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polydore.</SPEAKER>
<P>And have you then a deal of money, as they have, to satisfy a thousand wishes?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sage.</SPEAKER>
<P>Much more money; or at least, what is better, I have no wishes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polydore.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe, however, there is a deal of pleasure in contenting them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sage.</SPEAKER>
<P>A hundred times more pleasure, child, in being content of one's self, as I am.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polydore.</SPEAKER>
<P>But does not God, pray, love the rich a great deal more than you, since he bestows upon them so much gold and silver?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sage.</SPEAKER>
<P>Polydore, do not you recollect the wine that we had last Wednesday on the table, when your uncle came to dine and sup with us, and which you said was so delicious?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polydore.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, papa; I remember you were so good as to give me half a glass full of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sage.</SPEAKER>
<P>But you wanted more. I might have let you have it, since, you know, the bottle had a deal left in it, even after supper: why, then, did I not oblige you, pray?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polydore.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because you were afraid that it would make me ill.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sage.</SPEAKER>
<P>I recollect I told you so: and do not you think that I did right?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polydore.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! as for that, you did indeed; I know you love me, and are always studying how to make me happy.
<PB N="172" REF="184"/>So you would not have refused me such a trifle as a glass of wine, if you had thought that it would have pleased me, and not hurt my health.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sage.</SPEAKER>
<P>And can you think that God loves you less than I do?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polydore.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, papa, I cannot, after what I have heard you say so often of his goodness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sage.</SPEAKER>
<P>On the other hand, do you believe that he would have found it difficult to give you gold and silver in abundance?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polydore.</SPEAKER>
<P>No more difficult than I should find it to give any one a handful of the dust that we tread.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sage.</SPEAKER>
<P>On the other hand, do you believe that he would have found it difficult to give you gold and silver in abundance?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polydore.</SPEAKER>
<P>No more difficult than I should find it to give any one a handful of the dust that we tread.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sage.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then, if, as you acknowledge, he is able to bestow these on you, and does not bestow them, even though he loves you, what are you to think of his refusal?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polydore.</SPEAKER>
<P>That the riches which I desire from him would be hurtful.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sage.</SPEAKER>
<P>Are you perfectly convinced of this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polydore.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, perfectly, and have not a word to say against. Yet, papa—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sage.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well; why thus shake your head? You have still some burthen on your heart: what is it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polydore.</SPEAKER>
<P>Notwitstanding all your reasonings, I can never bring myself to fancy all this country yours.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sage.</SPEAKER>
<P>And why?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polydore.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because you cannot enjoy it as you please.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sage.</SPEAKER>
<P>You know the famous Mr. Norton?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polydore.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do I know him? Why that is he who has such charming gardens.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sage.</SPEAKER>
<P>And can he enjoy those gardens as he pleases?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polydore.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, indeed; poor man! he dares not even eat a bunch of grapes!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sage.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet you have seen some very fine ones in his garden?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polydore.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have; but they would do him harm.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sage.</SPEAKER>
<P>You see then, one may easily possess a num∣ber of good things, and yet not dare to use them as one likes. I dare not use my gardens as I certainly should like, because my fortune will not let me: and this Mr. Norton dares not use his garden as he likes, because his
<PB N="173" REF="185"/>health will not allow him. So that I am much the happiest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polydore.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, papa, you love to ride a horse-back— do not you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sage.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; for it is an exercise that does me good, when I have time to take it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polydore.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then, if these meadows are all yours, why do not you take the hay that grows upon them, and in future keep a horse?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sage.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why that is the very thing which I do. And those same hay-cocks that you see there, are po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bly in∣tended for the horse that I ride.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polydore.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet I never saw one in your stable?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sage.</SPEAKER>
<P>Heaven be praised, I am not at such a great expence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polydore.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nor do you ride as frequently as you would like?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sage.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are wrong: for I am so prudent, that I never wish to ride but when a ride would do me good, and then I get it for about three shillings. God be praised! I am rich enough to pay that sum.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polydore.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do not you imagine that to have two fine pie∣bald horses, and to be drawn about the country in a fashionable coach, would be very pleasant?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sage.</SPEAKER>
<P>Agreeable enough: but when I think of all the inconvenience that attends a coach; how often one would want the harness-maker, smith and wheelwright; how much one depends upon the health of horses, and the conduct of a coachman; and what risque one runs of being overset, together with the fatal consequences which luxury too frequently occasions,—truly, Polydore, I do not grieve that I am obliged to used my legs, which cer∣tainly will last me long enough. But see, the sun is now set, and we must think of getting home before the evening closes on us. Let me have your hand —Now, are you not quite pleased in having seen my great estate?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polydore.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! dear papa, I should be much more so, could I but be persuaded that it were yours.</P>
<P>The father smiled at this reply; and down the hill they walked together. As it happened, they went by a mea∣dow, which at first they thought had been a pond, because it was quite covered with water. Bless me! cried out Mr. Sage, do you see this meadow, how it is overflowed?
<PB N="174" REF="186"/>The neighbouring river must have burst its bounds, and all the hay this year is spoiled.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polydore.</SPEAKER>
<P>I fancy he to whom the hay belonged will not be very happy, when they tell him of his loss.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sage.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no; nor yet is this the worst: he will be forced to mend the banks, and very likely make ano∣ther dam Why, he will be very happy, if he does not spend in these repairs the produce of ten harvests that he could make in such a meadow.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polydore.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! What a misfortune!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sage.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I thought there had been a windmill hereabouts.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polydore.</SPEAKER>
<P>And there is, papa. Look there before you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sage.</SPEAKER>
<P>Right, I see it now: the reason is, I did not hear it going. I would lay any wager that the torrent coming down has forced away the wheelwork. Let us go see.—Just so.—It is broke to pieces.—What will the poor owner do? He must be very rich indeed, to stand against so many l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sses!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polydore.</SPEAKER>
<P>On! I pity him with all my heart! But since the c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y is over, pray why are the bricklayers still at work?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sage.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot tell why. We need but ask the reason. Pray friend, be so kind as to inform us why you work so late?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A Bricklayer.</SPEAKER>
<P>We shall be here all night; for yesterday, when it was dark, a gang of thieves pulled down the wall, that they might get into the park, and steal away the fur∣niture that had been put into a new built summer-house. The theft was not discovered till this morning; and in∣deed it is very lucky that no one caught them in the fact.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sage.</SPEAKER>
<P>How so?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>The Bricklayer.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because the thieves had previously dis∣posed combustibles to set the summer-house on fire, if they had been disturbed in plundering; so that they might get away assisted by the bustle and confusion which such destruction would have caused. The owner of this ground, as you may judge, is therefore very happy in his loss: he might have seen his summer-house burnt down; whereas, the affair will cost him now no more than some slight re∣pairs to his wall, the expence of keeping up a watch all night, and buying other furniture instead of the former, which indeed had cost him a good deal.</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="187"/>Well, Polydore, now said Mr. Sage to his son, when they had walked a little way in silence, what do you ob∣serve on these misfortunes? Do not they grieve you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polydore.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why should I be sorry? I have suffered no∣thing by them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sage.</SPEAKER>
<P>But if this estate had been your property, as Mr. Norton's grounds are his; and if, when going out this morning, you had seen your meadow overflowed, your wind-mill broken to pieces, your park wall demolished, and your summer-house robbed, would you have gone home as satisfied as you appear to be at present?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polydore.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh by no means. I should, on the contrary, be miserable, had I undergone so many heavy losses in a day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sage.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what if you had every day such losses to endure, or to dread? would you be as happy as at present?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polydore.</SPEAKER>
<P>I should be a thousand times more miserable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sage.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then, Polydore, such is in reality the state of all who possess great abundance. Without reckon∣ing up the cares that agitate them, and the innumerable wants which they fancy,—in the elevation of their for∣tune lies too frequently the cause of its decay. A bar∣ren season, or a false step in the pursuit of their rapacious projects, frequently suffices to produce their ruin. As they fear the loss of their imaginary consequence, should they resolve upon some sacrifices to their luxury and pride; the more they undergo distressing losses, the more they suppose that they ought to make a sumptuous show to keep up the appearance of their riches, and support a credit which already totters to its fall. What then is the effect of such a wretched sort of vanity? Their servants, per∣haps, kept out of their wages an unseasonable time, proceed to introduce a sort of robbery through all the house. The improvement of their fortune, and the edu∣cation of their children being overlooked, their lands in some sort as it were lie fallow, or produce a blighted har∣vest only; and their children, left to riot in the ways of wickedness, commit disgraceful actions which are stified by the necessary aid of money. All their property, when seized by inexorable creditors, is in the end completely dissipated, or else the law lays hold of what would other∣wise be left them. And these favourites of fortune, once
<PB N="176" REF="188"/>so proud of their abundance, elevated station, and enjoy∣ments, fall at once to the lowest pitch of indigence, shame an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pair.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polydore.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh what a frightful picture is this, papa?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sage.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is one, however, daily to be seen in society; and be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssured, there is not one exaggerated feature in the wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le portrait. I can at all times shew you, in the public papers, the dec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y of some great family or other: and these striking instances God's providence exposes to the observation of the rich, that they may see what fortune is most likely to await their pride and folly. In the mor∣ning we will go and gaze on those fine buildings which ex∣cite your envy now, where you may read the ruin of too many families inscribed on every pillar round about, till they are swallowed up themselves in their own ruin. Why, alas, can I not spare your sensibility the cries of many de∣solated families, which are but too evincing tokens of such miserable revolutions!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polydore.</SPEAKER>
<P>What then, should I look upon the mediocrity of our condition as a blessing meant us from above?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sage.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes; if you are only frugal and in∣dustrious, and possess sufficient resolution to renounce am∣bition and the immoderate wish of getting money, of confining your desires, and keeping them within the limits of that state you fill. Do I want any thing to make me happy? and in reason, would you wish hereafter to be happier than your father is? Consider the whole uni∣verse as your estate; since if you are but properly indus∣trious, it will furnish you a comfortable maintenance. God's providence has placed your earthly habitation half way up a hill, whose summit is extremely craggy, and its base choaked up with swamps. Lift up your eye at intervals upon the rich and great, not with a view to envy them their situations, but to think upon the storms that bellow round them. Sometimes too, look down upon the poor beneath you, not by way of insult on their friendless situation, but to hold them out your hand. If God should bless you with a family of children, let them often hear the lesson which I have just now taught you; but particularly, give them in your life and man∣ners that example which God's blessing has enabled me to afford you.</P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="189"/>By this time they were both at home. The virtuous Mr. Sage went up stairs into his chamber, and there falling on his knees, gave thanks to God for all the blessings which he had constantly received, and offered him the sacrifice of his existence, as the best return that he could make. What need had he of being any longer upon earth? His days had been replete with probity and honour, and by giving such a lesson on contentment to his son, he endeavoured, as far as in him lay, to endow him with a valuable patrimony, such as no one could take from him.</P>

<P>I hope not: if we had expected him here, we should not have stirred out.</P>

<P>He o-o-only thinks of mis-mischief.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>What has he done then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Elder Danby.</SPEAKER>
<P>We were both going out last Saturday. I stopped to get a handkerchief: my brother went down stairs alone, and, as it happened, Roberts hearing some one, came out slily, jumped at once upon my brother, who was frighted, lost his footing, and rolled down the stairs from top to bottom.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>Poor Danby! I am sorry for you. Roberts looks for all the world as if he loved such mischief. We shall have his company this evening for the first time in our lives: his father begged papa to let him come and see us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Elder Danby.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sorry for it. For we do not speak to one another.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>My papa supposed you all good friends, because you lodge together, and considered that you would have the greater pleasure if he came.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Elder Danby.</SPEAKER>
<P>The greater pleasure! We should like to have him ten miles off. Since he has been our neighbour, we are continually uneasy. He has frequently amused himself with breaking windows, and then tried to lay the blame on us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>Does no one make complaint about him to his father?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Elder Danby.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! I do not know what to make of him; he is such an odd sort of a man! He scolds a little, pays the damage, and that is all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>If I were your papa, I would quit my lodgings and live somewhere else.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="182" REF="194"/>
<SPEAKER>Elder Danby.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, so he means to do, and therefore yesterday gave warning; and now we are forbidden all manner of connexion with this Roberts, he is so wicked! Would you think it, very few go by the house, without being apprehensive that he will put some trick upon them. Sometimes he diverts himself by squirting puddle water at them, or else pelting them with rotten apples. Nay, he will sometimes fasten rabbits tails or bits of rags behind their backs, at which the people, when they see it, all burst out a laughing. Then too he has what he calls his <HI>caxen fishery.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>Caxen fishery!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Elder Danby.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes: he will take the people's wigs off, as they pass him, with a hook, as you would carp. When any poor man stops before his window to converse with an acquaintance, Roberts immediately goes up to the bal∣cony, with a string suspended from a fishing-rod, and at the end of it a hook, with which he jerks the poor man's wig off. Then he runs and ties it to a dog that he has before provided for the purpose, after which he drives the creature out into the street, and off he sets that instant, so that the poor perriwig has frequently been dragged for twenty minutes through the mud, before its owner can lay hold of it again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>But this is more than mere amusement!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Elder Danby.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet this is nothing to the stories that I could tell you. Why, he lames or bruises all the dogs and cats that come within his reach. Nor is it long ago, when one of his relations broke a leg, by slipping down upon the stairs where Roberts had been scattering peas on purpose. Ay, it is so; or else our name is not Danby. And for the servants, I am sure, his father would not get one to attend him, if he did not pay extraordinary wages.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>Shall I tell you now? I long to see him. I like boys a little merry.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Elder Danby.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing is more natural: but Roberts's mirth is not like other children's. You, I know, love laughing in your heart; but would not, for the world, hurt any one; whereas this wicked fellow laughs at bumps and bruises.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>For you, sir, I could draw you at a glance, and I must tell you, the similitude would not be very pleasing.

<P>The truth is, I was apprehensive lest you might think of playing me some trick; so I accompanied you. But now that we are returned, and all alone, we may de∣vise some mirth between us.</P>

<P>Very willingly; I ask no better: so let us think a little.</P>

<P>We must have some fun, I fancy, with the younger Danby.</P>

<P>They told me that you were always merry, and fond of something funny.</P>

<P>And so I am: but, notwithstanding, without hurt to any one. However, let me know what sort of fun you meant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>Look you: here are two large needles. I will stick them both with the points upward in the bottom of two chairs, that common eyes shall not discern them. In the next place you shall offer two of these young ladies the two chairs, for very likely they would suspect that I meant them mischief of some sort or other, and they will naturally both sit down: but figure to yourself what strange grimaces they will both make! Ha! ha! ha! ha! It makes me die a laughing, when I barely think what faces we shall see them put on! Ay, ay! and your prudish sister, too, will find the matter quite diverting.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>But suppose I were to treat you just in the same manner, would you like it?</P>

<P>Oh! treat me! that is different; but those little idiots—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>So you call them idiots, do you, since they are not mischievous?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, you are mighty formal and precise. Then shall I mention something else?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I have some thread as strong as whip∣cord in my pocket. I will thread one of these great needles with a little of it; and as soon as they are all come down, one of us shall go up politely towards them, make a deal of scraping, and wry faces, while the other, keeping still behind, shall sew their gowns together. They will all want to dance, as you may guess; so up we will come, and take them out.—Ha! ha! you know the rest; ha! ha! ha! ha! ha!</P>
</SP>

<P>Yes, to tear their gowns, and get them anger when their parents find it out?</P>

<P>What is the matter?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>It will be better that we should come upon them where we are, if I can bring the others down; for when there are but two or three in this part of the house, there sometimes comes a spirit; and in that case, we ourselves should be but badly off.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is all this story of a spirit?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, it is true. At first one hears a noise, and then a phantom with a lighted torch glides by, and then the room seems all on fire.
<STAGE>(He draws back, as if afraid.)</STAGE> Oh! methinks I see it now.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank, </SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(drawing Roberts towards a corner, and then whispering to him.)</STAGE>
<P>The reason, as we are told, is this: There was a miser who lived here formerly, and he was robbed one night of all his money. In despair he cut his throat, and now from time to time his ghost goes up and down—</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Elder Danby.</SPEAKER>
<P>He can never do enough; and though his scheme should be a little hard on Roberts, there will be instruction in it: it is the greatest service that one can do him: and his father, I am persuaded, will be pleased with Frank, when he hears what pains he has taken to instruct his son. Alas! he would part with half his for∣tune, to have Roberts like him.</P>

<P>No, ladies, that is not necessary. There is a little violence, I must acknowledge, in my plot, and therefore I will not make you parties. I have been settling every thing with Ralph in the stable. He con∣ceives my meaning clearly, and will second it with great dexterity.</P>

<SPEAKER>Lucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>But still, you do not acquaint me—</P>

<P>This is all of the contrivance that you need know. We will go to Blind-man's Buff, that Roberts may suspect no harm on his return. I will let myself be caught, and he or she that blinds me must take care that I may have an opportunity of seeing through the hand∣kerchief, and fixing upon Roberts.

<P>Do you promise me yourself?</P>

<SPEAKER>Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes; upon my honour.</P>

<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then, I take pity on you: but remember, had it been my pleasure, I might easily fly away with you through the window.</P>

<STAGE>Here the phantom shakes his torch, which gives a glare like lightning, and then goes out. Roberts almost swooning with terror, falls down on his face.)</STAGE>

<P>What is all this disturbance?</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Roberts, </SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(without looking up.)</STAGE>
<P>It is not I that make it. Pray, pray, do not come near me!</P>

<SPEAKER>Mr. Jephson, </SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(perceiving Roberts on the ground.)</STAGE>
<P>Who can this be on the ground?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>You know me well enough, and have already taken pity on me.</P>

<SPEAKER>Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was not I that robbed you.</P>

<P>Robbed me! what does all this mean? do not I know you, master Roberts?—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes; that is my name, good ghost: so pray do not hurt me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Jephson.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am astonished! why in such a posture?
<STAGE>He puts down the light, holds out his hand and lifts him up.)</STAGE></P>

<SPEAKER>Roberts, </SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(struggling first of all, but knowing Mr. Jephson afterwards.)</STAGE>
<P>Mr. Jephson, is it you?

<STAGE>he looks round about him, sees the ghost and turns away again.)</STAGE> There, there he stands! —the phantom!—don't you see him?</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Frank brings the children from the closet. Laura and younger Danby are frightened at the groom's appearance; but the rest burst out a laughing.)</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Jephson.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well! what signifies all this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank, </SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(coming forward.)</STAGE>
<P>Let me explain the whole, papa. This phantom is your groom; and we have put on him your wig and gown.</P>

<SPEAKER>The Groom, </SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(letting fall his disguise.)</STAGE>
<P>Yes, sir, it is I.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Jephson.</SPEAKER>
<P>An odd sort of sport this, Frank!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>True; but ask the company if master Roberts has not well deserved to be thus frightened. He designed to frighten Laura and Danby: I only wished to hinder him. Let him but shew the frightful mask that he has about him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Jephson, </SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(to Roberts.)</STAGE>
<P>Is this true?</P>

<SPEAKER>Roberts, </SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(giving him the mask.)</STAGE>
<P>I cannot deny it: here it is, sir.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mr. Jephson.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have met with nothing, then, but what you deserve.</P>

<SPEAKER>Dorinda.</SPEAKER>
<P>We persuaded Miss Lucy to permit her brother to make use of this device in order to punish Roberts.</P>

<SPEAKER>Alice.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you knew besides, sir, all the other tricks that he meant to play us—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Jephson.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, sir, is this the sample that you give us of your behaviour, the first time you set foot within∣my doors? You have been disrespectful to me in the per∣son of my children, who were pleased with the expectation of having you as their guest. You have been disrespectful to these ladies, whom I need not say you should have honoured and regarded. So be gone! Your father, when he comes to know that you have been thus turned out of doors, will see how necessary it is to correct the vices of your heart. I will not permit your detestable example to corrupt my children. Go, and never let me see you here again!
<STAGE>Roberts is confounded, and withdraws.)</STAGE> And you, my friends, although the circumstances of the case may very possibly excuse what you have done, yet never, for the time to come, indulge yourselves in such a sport. The fears which have power to affect children at a tender age, may possibly be followed by the worst consequences during their whole life. Avenge yourselves upon the wicked only by behaving better; and remember after the example which master Roberts has afforded you, that by intending harm to others, you will oftenest bring it down upon yourselves.</P>
