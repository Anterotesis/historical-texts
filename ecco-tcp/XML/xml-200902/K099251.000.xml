<STAGE>Enter Whitmore and Lovemore.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WHITMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>SO my dear Charles, you are at length, after a passage of five weeks, three days, and odd hours, arrived in our little sun-burnt island?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOVEMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing, I'll assure you Whitmore, would have brought me on this side the Atlantic, but my unconquerable passion for the adorable Louisa Winstone.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="4" REF="5"/>
<SPEAKER>WHITMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Miss Winstone, Sir, has been long the belle of this island, and has been the occasion, I al∣ready hear, of much envy among the ladies, and as much passion among the gentlemen. But could you obtain nothing more desirable at home, that you must needs neglect an Albion flower for a poor drooping Antigua blossom?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOVEMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't dishonour my Louisa by any odious comparison. Before she left England she car∣ried the rose in her cheeks, the rainbow in her forehead, lightning in her eyes, with grace, innocence and elegance in her whole frame.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WHITMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hush, hush, man; don't be over extrava∣gant; I grant Miss Winstone might have pos∣sessed all you say upon her first arrival here, but you do not know how soon every thing fades in this climate. For my own part, I cannot say much for her complexion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOVEMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Her complexion Sir, I grant you, may be a little tanned, but I am sure her features ever must remain beautiful. My dear Whitmore I am impatient to see her; conduct me therefore to her father's wherever it is.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="5" REF="6"/>
<SPEAKER>WHITMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is just by; but I am so engaged with plan∣tation business that I am afraid I shall hardly be able to spare a minute from the toils of the crop. However Sir, not to baulk so passionate a lover, I'll mount you on the best steed I have, and follow you like a true 'Squire on the best mule or jack ass on the whole estate. But pray, Sir, would you not chuse a draught of punch after your hot ride from town? it is the custom here always to have the bowl in readiness. Here, Cesar, Cesar.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CESAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Coming, Massah.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WHITMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>But pray, Sir, what impression do you re∣ceive from the scenes about you in this part of the world.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOVEMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why truly I am at a loss to explain them; but they are upon the whole very strange. As I journeyed through the different estates I heard as I thought nothing but the cracking and bouncing of fire works; but was very soon convinced that the noise proceeded from the smacks of the whips, and the correction which is daily and hourly inflicted on the slaves.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="6" REF="7"/>
<SPEAKER>WHITMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, Sir, I am sorry to say it, but we are obliged to put the whip to a slave as we do a match to powder, in order to get it to act at all. Cesar, I say Cesar!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CESAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Coming, Massah! coming.
<STAGE>yawning.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOVEMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>How slow the fellow is.
<STAGE>yawning.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WHITMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Every thing, Sir, is slow in this climate, the horses are slow, the cattle slow, mules slow, in short a general sloth hangs upon every thing. Cesar! Cesar! Cesar!
<STAGE>bawling hastily.</STAGE></P>
<STAGE>[Cesar yawns, rubs his eyes, and produces the bowl of punch.]</STAGE>
<P>What, Sir, were you asleep? stupor hangs as naturally upon the dog, as mist upon the mountains. My service to you, Sir.
<STAGE>Drinks, and hands it to Lovemore.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOVEMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pleasant liquor in troth.
<STAGE>Drinks again.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="7" REF="8"/>
<SPEAKER>WHITMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye don't drink too much of it though; for it may play the devil with you till you are better used to the climate. Here, Mr. Cesar, take it away, and saddle the young English horse for this gentleman, and my manager's mule for me. Do you hear?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CESAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Massah, me bring um up directly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WHITMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>If possible do so, but I am afraid you will re∣quire another nap first.
<STAGE>Exit Cesar.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOVEMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I should conceive it, Sir, a very laborious and painful employment to have the inspection of a gang of slaves; have there been no ef∣forts made to raise them above their brutal state, and to inspire them with the sentiments of man?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WHITMORE</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir, there was one man mad enough to make the attempt; but it was very speedily found that as the slaves of his own estate im∣proved in intellectual discernment, their corpo∣real faculties relaxed, so that the other gentle∣men of the island by woeful experience very soon dropped their liberal sentiments, and hung the dead weight of ignorance again about them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="8" REF="9"/>
<SPEAKER>LOVEMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ignorance undoubtedly is the true cause of slavery.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WHITMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is a truth, Sir, which we find verified every day; but pray, as you are so passionate an admirer of Miss Winstone, why did you not pre∣vent her voyage to this part of the world?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOVEMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why I was then Sir, but a minor, and though Miss Winstone favored my addresses, her father thought Jack Rattoon a better match for her, so brought her over to marry him against her consent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WHITMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very true, Sir, I recollect the whole affair; she became on her arrival the adoration of the men in general, and very soon grew out of humour with Jack, whose face she compared to a large four-sop; and whose head she declared was as soft as a rotten quaver.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOVEMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, Sir, what are the distinguishing good qualities of the ladies of this part of the world.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WHITMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fidelity to their husbands, and tenderness to their children.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOVEMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>The inhabitants too are in general remarked
<PB N="9" REF="10"/>
for their hospitality to strangers, as well as their candour and openness to each other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WHITMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>They are so, Sir, but these take their rise from the social principle of man's nature, and which the want of society creates. But here, I see Cesar has already prepared and saddled our cattle, therefore like a true Knight-Errant equip yourself at all points, to meet your beauteous Dulcinia?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOVEMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>That I am already; what more would you have?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WHITMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will play this romantic youth a trick
<STAGE>aside. [aloud]</STAGE>
Why, Sir, though it may surprize you, it is a custom here, whenever any gentleman pays his first visit to the lady he loves, to go armed and defended with all the weapons and implements of chivalry.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOVEMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly you jest?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WHITMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>No in faith it is an old custom, derived from the Spaniards, to whom you know these islands first belonged.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOVEMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Impossible!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="10" REF="11"/>
<SPEAKER>WHITMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay but it is actually so, and unless you permit me to arm you like a Knight-Errant, you will not see Miss Winstone to-day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOVEMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why my dear Mr. Whitmore you'll make a fool of me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WHITMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>A fool of you indeed; I'll put Minerva's own helmet on your head, and you shall then see if you don't look as wise as a judge. Here, Cesar, fetch my old helmet, with the shield and sword.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CESAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Massah.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOVEMORE.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>aside</STAGE>
<P>Certainly this man does not mean to expose me; what he says is very true; this island be∣longed to Spain, and it is probable that a tincture of chivalry might have been derived from that source; besides, he is a West Indian, and tells the truth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WHITMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>First, Sir, let me gird on the sword; there,
<PB N="11" REF="12"/>
there it is; now put the shield thus; and now last of all, Cesar fetch me the spear.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CESAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>There, Massah,
<STAGE>presenting the spear.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOVEMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon my word, Mr. Whitmore, if I had known this was necessary, I would have brought a compleat suit of armour with me from Eng∣land.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WHITMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>That would not have done so well perhaps; now Sir look at yourself in the first glass you come to, and see if you are not as warlike as Jack the Giant-killer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOVEMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am obliged to you though, for making me so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WHITMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have nothing to do Sir, but to push your spear against the first rival you meet on the road.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOVEMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Rivals Sir! I hope to God I shall not meet any.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WHITMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>You will certainly meet a great many. Only consider the beauty and accomplishments of the lady. She is always surrounded by rivals Sir.
<PB N="12" REF="13"/>
Pray by what name do you chuse to be an∣nounced to her?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOVEMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>By my own to be sure; James Jeremiah Lovemore, Esq.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WHITMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pugh, pugh, the name of Lovemore will be a disgrace to Knighthood; call yourself the Knight of the Dreadful Phiz.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOVEMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye any thing. Let us be off as fast as we can.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WHITMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>But harkee Mr. Knight, can you ride well? for if you cannot the horse will certainly throw you, as you must expect he'll start at the sight of a man in armour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOVEMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Where then is the use of armour, if it exposes a man to new dangers; and as for my riding Sir, I am by no means secure in my saddle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WHITMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then there will be an end to your knight hood if you once come to the ground: but come Sir, our cattle are braying, and I long for some new atchievement.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOVEMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, I wish I don't break my neck.</P>

<HEAD><HI>Scene II.</HI> An Apartment in the House of Mr. Winstone.</HEAD>
<STAGE>Enter Louisa and Hannah.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOUISA.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is very true as you say. Hannah, what is the faith and the truth of artful men? Do you think I can have the assurance to hope that Mr. Love∣more will renew his addresses, especially when he sees me turned as brown as a gipsey.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HANNAH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed Cousin Winstone, you deserve to be tanned, as a punishment for the coquettish airs you practised upon all the men at your first arrival: aye Cousin, who was then so cruel as yourself?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOUISA.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is cruel Miss Hannah in you to accuse me of being a coquet; but girls like you, who were never handsome or fair, take a pleasure in seeing every one reduced to their own standard.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HANNAH.</SPEAKER>
<P>You may talk as you please Miss Winstone, when but last week, you know, Mr. Cogwil, a rich manager of this island, made love to me in your presence, what did you do then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOUISA.</SPEAKER>
<P>What did I do then!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="14" REF="15"/>
<SPEAKER>HANNAH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, how did you look then? in truth you looked Miss, I can tell you, like a windmill stript of its f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>s and not a breeze of wind to turn it round.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOUISA.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is better Madam to be without a breeze of wind than to require such cattle as Mr. Cogwil to set one in motion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HANNAH.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't care for your repartees; you don't recol∣lect I suppose how you used to dance with one, drop your fan for another, propose some foolish errand for a third, and in short ogle the red coats so much, that they no doubt contributed with the rays of the sun, to toast you into your present crisp and brown complexion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOUISA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray cousin, when were your family, the family of the Bananahs, accounted wits, that you should at this day begin to play it off upon me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HANNAH.</SPEAKER>
<P>You need not, I can tell you, be so severe; for though I was never at Queen-square boarding school, as you have been, I have received as good an education as you, and that though I was never off the island.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOUISA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray let us have done scolding, and wait Mr.
<PB N="15" REF="16"/>
Lovemore's arrival here, who is to be introduced to us by his acquaintance, Mr. Whitmore; he may, notwithstanding my charms are fled, find others more durable in my mind; these perhaps will be enough, and bring him to my feet, without the assistance of any others.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HANNAH.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wish you may find it so, Miss Winstone, but I believe he will be the first man who ever fell at the feet of a plain woman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOUISA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, my dear Coz, did you not tell me Mr. Cogwil fell at your's?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HANNAH.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Miss, he did not fall at my feet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOUISA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Though you were so handsome!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HANNAH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, Miss, if you persist in teazing, I will ac∣tually complain of it to your papa, for it isn't to be borne.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter old Winstone.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WINSTONE.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear girls take care of yourselves, for a man has been just seen on the borders of the estate,
<PB N="16" REF="17"/>
clad in a compleat suit of armour; he has fright∣ened the slaves from their work, startled the mule that carried one of my overseers, and been the means of putting out the fellow's shoulder.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HANNAH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Good gracious, Sir!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WINSTONE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Good gracious indeed! it is to my thinking a most ungracious piece of business all together; for God's sake take care of yourselves.</P>

<SP>

that is because there is such a scarcity of bon mots; I attempted you saw to laugh at myself, but all my laughter made them ha! ha! ha! as loud again as before.</P>

<P>True, true, to a proverb. I pity you indeed.</P>

<P>Zounds no; but you are welcome to beat out my brains.</P>

What Sir, am I a pickled herring, a merry Andrew, a jack pudding, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WHITMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! yes Sir, you are a walking repository of

fun for the whole island; a nostrum against the spleen; better than bark for the fever or the ague; indeed a punch himself could not have pleased us better.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOVEMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I see, Sir, the cause of all this affected risibility. The imagined slight put upon a West Indian fe∣male, has turned all the heads here both young and old into the soft texture of the calabash, and their hearts into the ratling nature of a tropical sand box.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WHITMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Sir, they laugh from their souls, I believe; I do from mine, I must confess; even the Coun∣cil and Assembly laughed at you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOVEMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Council and Assembly are fools. Let them laugh on.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WHITMORE</SPEAKER>
<P>They have sent over too, a most diverting anec∣dote of it to the Parliament in England; now if you say they are fools, we will indict you for Mag∣natum Scandalum.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOVEMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>A pretty instance of their wisdom faith. This is more like the government of Lilliputians now than ever. I cannot see a woman without a mask, all ashamed to shew their faces.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WHITMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Quite the reverse, the shame lies upon you. The
<PB N="46" REF="47"/>
mask is only a hint to you to hide yours; they indeed put it to theirs, as we put the fore-finger on the nose to a child, thus, when it does amiss. ah! ah!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOVEMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, I know I was pointed at. But I shall leave you to yourselves; I am beset on all sides: one questions me concerning the lady's beauty, ano∣ther admires my taste, and a third exclaims in wonder at my gallantry; and in short I am a Don Quixote, Sancha Pancha, and every thing they think that is mad and ridiculous.

<P>Nor any one else indeed. You perfectly danced a rigadoon for the first hour after the oil was laid on.</P>

<SPEAKER>HANNAH.</SPEAKER>
<P>You had love, and love enough; for you may recollect you said you thought the very God of Love himself was running his sharp pointed arrows into

your face, which indeed he could not have done had he not blinded you before.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOUISA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed it was the most comical, and at the same time the most painful sensation I ever felt.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HANNAH.</SPEAKER>
<P>You were one moment laughing, the next cry∣ing, then stamping, and then sneezing, that upon my word I began to tremble for you myself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOUISA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Verses and sonnets, now Hannah, you shall see will fly from all quarters; one bard will praise my eye brows, another my complexion, and all together join in chorus on the subject of my skill, fortitude, and resolution.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HANNAH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why may you not be satyrised and lampooned, instead of being praised and commended? why not nick-named and laughed at for your folly? and in short put in the class of those animals who actually cast their skins off.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOUISA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why if I am classed in that rank, I will send the skin of my face to England, there to be deposited in the British-Museum, and preserved amongst the other curiosities of the place.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HANNAH.</SPEAKER>
<P>It would have been a greater curiosity, cousin Winstone, to have seen you in pickle yourself, as well as the curious graft of the cushoo upon the body of the pine, ha! hal ha!</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HANNAH.</SPEAKER>
<P>By the sun and moon, Miss, your vanity is enough to turn your head: presume to shew me any more airs, or make any more odious compari∣sons, and I will very shortly render your face as yellow, as I now have made it fair.</P>

<P>There it is. Now I suppose you will tell all the Island.</P>

<P>To be sure, to be sure man: I would'nt lose a joke for the world, ha! ha! ha!</P>

<PB N="52" REF="53"/>
<SPEAKER>LOVEMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Jokes, one would think, were as scarce as drops of rain, and that the inhabitants stood with their mouths open, to catch and swallow them down. But what, Sir, has become of Miss Winstone all this while? She has been now ill near a fortnight I think.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WHITMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes your cold armour struck such a damp to her soul, that she has been laid up with the ague ever since.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOVEMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mum for that. I'll embark immediately. Your vermin in this part of the world are very fond of fresh English flesh; my legs are now blistered with the knats, my toes devoured by chiggers, a centi∣pes stung my nose the other night, and while I was at dinner a few days since, just as I was about to taste a bit of the most delicious part of the turtle, behold, to the admiration of the company, a large cock roach flew pop into my mouth.</P>

<P>Because thou art always deserving it. I will then if you please accompany you to the water side, and pity you there for the last time.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>LOVEMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wish I was well out at sea, with all my heart. I have already been drank into a fever, when I meant most to drink healths; and am indeed so apprehensive of a famine, that I wish to get back again as fast as I can.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WHITMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do not be afraid of that. I have an antidote against it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOVEMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray tell me what it is?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WHITMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is daily practised by our negroes, and it is this—to bind the belly hard.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOVEMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>To bind the belly! Why is it not a very savage custom?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="54" REF="55"/>
<SPEAKER>WHITMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>To bind it externally I mean, with a handker∣chief or band, thus.
<STAGE>shewing him.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOVEMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>But how does it compensate for the loss of food? It appears to me worse than the Russian bread, made of sawdust.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WHITMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why you see the sensation of pain, arising from hunger, is produced by the action of the two coats of the stomach acting upon each other; now the bandage confining the stomach, and preventing this action, of course takes away the pain. This therefore is one argument among many others to prove that digestion is performed by the action of the mastication of the stomach, and not by putre∣faction as some physicians erroneously supposed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOVEMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>This indeed is natural, and obvious enough; but it certainly cannot support a man, as you would have me believe. I should be devilishly loth to be served in that manner.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WHITMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>It answers so well Sir, that a negroe, deprived of his usual food, and at the very moment without an ounce to support nature, will continue at his work for many hours.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOVEMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is a rare custom indeed. I will publish it at my return to England, as a precious preservative
<PB N="55" REF="56"/>
to all hungry poets, extravagant rakes, and proud beggars; but Sir, as you are about this, could'nt you teach your slaves to chew their cud at once; they are the only beasts of burthen that do not I believe.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WHITMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>That would be bad policy. It would be to open a second stomach when we could not answer the cravings of the first.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOVEMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! I recollect the reason now of your putting the mouth-piece upon them; but in case that should not answer, and they should by chance slip any thing down the throat, egad you'd let it choak them by confining the stomach.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WHITMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is a reason founded in your own ingenuity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOVEMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! Mr. Whitmore, slavery is a damned thing. I was near flinging an overseer t'other day into a cauldron of hot liquor for flogging a slave beyond his deserts. Here comes Captain Wyndham, bring∣ing laughter and ridicule along with him, I dare say.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>WYNDHAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Gentlemen, your humble servant. What Mr. Lovemore musing again upon that dear fair one, the adorable Miss Winstone.</P>

<SPEAKER>WHITMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Wyndham thouseest things sacred and profane con∣spire

against the poor fellow. Women ugly and handsome insult him to his face; spinsters and de∣cayed matrons ridicule and laugh at him behind his back.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WYNDHAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Give thyself no further trouble, Lovemore; and as for Miss Winstone, if she pretends to laugh at you, believe me it is on the wrong side of her face; for she is now like a bird that had moulted its fea∣thers away.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOVEMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am rejoiced to my soul to hear it; any other woman at the point of death would have asked me pardon for the fruitless trouble she had given me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WYNDHAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is quite the reverse with her; for she did no∣thing but abuse you I am told, and that you in fact run as much in her head, as she did once in your heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOVEMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>As she has cast her feathers as you say, I am in hopes she will cast her bill likewise, and leave off speaking.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WYNDHAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have just had a commission from old Winstone to bring you and our friend Whitmore to his estate to see a most precious piece of wax-work. This he reckons a great curiosity, and wishes you to view it before you return to England.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="57" REF="58"/>
<SPEAKER>WHITMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>So I should think; and I wonder I never heard of it before. Old Winstone is the last man whom I should suppose a connoisseur; and so enlightened in natural history, that I am certain he would not know the shell of a turtle from that of a crab, if it was not that he generally had one or the other every day at his table.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WYNDHAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>But come, let us proceed without delay. I am in hopes of seeing his beautiful daughter, and know∣ing whether her face is grown any browner than it was; indeed I am not sorry for it; for the sun which tanned her complexion has turned the best spirits of her disposition to vinegar.

<SPEAKER>LOVEMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>But the statue of that lady, represented as lean∣ing
<PB N="59" REF="60"/>
upon the pedestal, is the most like the dear creature your daughter who won my heart in Eng∣land.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WYNDHAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon my soul she is very handsome.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>looking at her with his glass.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOVEMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I observe Sir, however, that there is a degree of strength in the lines of the face, and though the figure represents a person asleep, it is like one un∣der the painful pressure and influence of the night∣mare.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WINSTONE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Just so Sir: my poor daughter could never sleep without it. Blooded continually; but indeed it was of little service, for her poor dear mother fell a victim to it herself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WHITMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye poor soul! you should tell Mr. Lovemore Sir, that the staggers and the night-mare are the prevailing complaints of this island.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOVEMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>That I can well believe, as I have been stag∣gered at every thing I have heard since my arrival. Oh! this divine creature Sir! she takes up all my attention.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WHITMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>So it seems. But pray who does this black fi∣gure represent?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WINSTONE.</SPEAKER>
<P>That Sir represents the identical figure of a slave,
<PB N="60" REF="61"/>
who having absconded and hid himself, was at length discovered, brought home, and severely flogged; but happening to die under the lash, was unfortunately, (for his expeditions to the woods,) somewhat too prematurely sent to the shades.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOVEMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your anger then Sir, did not pursue him after death?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WINSTONE.</SPEAKER>
<P>O God! Sir, no. He haunted my conscience for ever after; he appeared at night by my bed side, and in short troubled me so much, that in order to appease the fellow's ghost I erected this to his honour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WHITMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>He was a revengeful fellow, though a damn'd good cooper, and came from Guinea. I knew him well.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WINSTONE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now the ghost of another country slave would not have troubled me, but have lain quiet enough.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOVEMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Heaven I see has revenged the old man's seve∣rity, and for a slave killed has returned him a daughter burned; for a black lost, a mulatto gained.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WYNDHAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was well Sir, that as you cut short the thread of his mortality, you raised this bust to his fame and renown.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WINSTONE.</SPEAKER>
<P>There was nothing for it but that; the group of
<PB N="61" REF="62"/>
other figures you see, are pieces done from fancy, white, black, and yellow; but that which takes up Mr. Lovemore's attention is the principal one.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOVEMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Would you be so obliging as to permit me to touch this wax, for upon my soul the artificial ver∣million of the lips looks so much like real, balmy, benign true blood, that I am almost tempted to kiss them. If I gaze longer, like the statuarist of old I shall forget myself, and fall in love with a piece of wax. I will! I must! thou sweetest piece of artificial nature! Ha!</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Starting back as he goes to touch it, Miss Winstone oversets the pedestal, and falls back into the attitude of a fencer, with her fan in her right hand; Mr. Lovemore, after expressing much surprize, clasps his hands in rapture, the other gentlemen seem much sur∣prized, and make a pause; old Winstone resting his chin upon a cudgel.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WHITMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why damme Captain, old Winstone deals with the devil.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WYNDHAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, you know his conscience was haunted be∣fore.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WHITMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>He is now like a Persian worshipping the Sun.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WINSTONE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Gentlemen, what is the matter?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WHITMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>How can you ask, when you surprize us so. Is the lady really Miss Winstone, or a piece of organized wax work.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="62" REF="63"/>
<SPEAKER>WINSTONE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Go to her and see.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WHITMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not I faith.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WYNDHAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nor I, for I have not faith. How these women love mischief; she wished to surprize me, I sup∣pose, because I was a soldier.</P>
<STAGE>[Winstone, his daughter, and the company burst into a fit of laughter.]</STAGE>
<P><STAGE>[To Lovemore]</STAGE>
Well, Sir, how do you feel now?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOVEMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! Sir, I cannot tell you. I begin to suspect the wax figures to be all impostors.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WHITMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so do I. We must take care what we say, and keep close together.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOVEMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'm afraid old Winstone means to wreck his re∣venge upon me, and that the other figures are all bullies.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOUISA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha! ha! ha! you three sneaking, cowardly fellows, hold up your heads, and look upon me. You, Captain Wyndham, what do you mean by pro∣faning this place, after making the unfortunate Miss Winstone the subject of your scandalous con∣versation and ridicule; do you come here with that brown face, and false heroic air of yours, to endea∣vour once more to subdue the creature you despised?</P>

<P>Well said, my dear: upbraid them to the pur∣pose.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOUISA.</SPEAKER>
<P>You too, Mr. Whitmore, what do you do here, Sir? Do you think, with that ugly face, any wo∣man will ever adopt you even as her gallant? are not you enough to frighten the God of Love, blunt his arrows, and be the very sport of all genuine pas∣sion?</P>

<P>Contemptible as the evasion is, I believe it; and the worst that shall befall you is to be most hear∣tily laughed at.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOVEMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>That I have been already, Madam. Could not you change the punishment to running the gaunt∣let? Regard me, Madam, as a poor, silly fellow, who came a great way on a wild goose chace, who knew no better, one of the fools of nature, and the slave of your sex.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOUISA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Therefore the best subject for its scorn.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WINSTONE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well done, my dear. How charmingly she re∣taliates. Why Mr. Lovemore, my daughter is se∣vere upon you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOVEMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes Sir, if you set her on.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WINSTONE.</SPEAKER>
<P>In truth, Sir, I do; and had she not made amends for your ill manners by shooting you plump through the heart just now, I was determined to have run you through the body.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WHITMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>That, Sir, you may do yet, and I will be your se∣cond. Poor Lovemore, how I pity thee!</P>

<SPEAKER>WYNDHAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>For my part I expect to see all the other figures start into life. They are all black, white, and yel∣low, the natural children of old Winstone. How, pray Madam, was the miracle wrought in your countenance?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Tell us, Madam, that we may make ourselves as lovely as you could wish.</P>

<P>Lovely, ha! ha! ha!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WINSTONE.</SPEAKER>
<P>My daughter's method of regaining her com∣plexion is kept a profound secret; but you and Captain Wyndham may regain your's by the assist∣ance of steel filings, brown sand, scalding hot wa∣ter, and a scowering brush.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WYNDHAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why that will take the skin off!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WHITMORE</SPEAKER>
<P>The old gentleman will not tell us, Wyndham, for I see he means to monopolize the patent to himself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOVEMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, he is afraid of my carrying it to England be∣fore him; but it is of no consequence, as it has wrought so agreeable a change in this charming lady.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOUISA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well said, Sir. In England you compared me

to alabaster; just now you thought me a piece of wax-work: but it is the way of all mankind, whatever they imagine us at first, they find us mere downright flesh and blood.</P>

<P>You have a new subject for pity then, Whitmore.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WHITMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>But not so good as the old; no you are the best subject for pity I ever saw under the sun.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WYNDHAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>He wants to change the fool's cap and bell from
<PB N="77" REF="78"/>
his own head to that of the poor lady's; that is not like a true knight-errant I must say.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WHITMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye that is cowardly and pitiful to a degree.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOUISA.</SPEAKER>
<P>But Mr. Lovemore, what if I should lose my complexion again?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOVEMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then you must repeat the experiment again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WHITMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes and have another suit of armour, and ano∣ther 'Squire like myself to help him out.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WINSTONE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Lovemore, my resentment is past; my knowledge of your family, fortune, and connec∣tions, teach me to pardon the follies of an under∣standing crouded with romance. In mere com∣pliment to a heart regulated by the greatest philan∣thropy and benevolence, my daughter is your's, I give her to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WHITMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>With your estate, Sir, in see simple I presume.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WINSTONE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hold your tongue, Sir; what right have you to presume.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOVEMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now Whitmore here is an end to your pity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WHITMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>An encrease you mean. I pity thee more than ever. Mr. Greville with his blotched face, the black fellow with his, Miss Winstone, who was some time ago on the rack, are not so much to be
<PB N="78" REF="79"/>
pitied. Come along Wyndham, he is no longer fit for us, he is going to be married.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WYNDHAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! I pity him then from my very soul; harkee
<STAGE>[aside]</STAGE>
if he has not his face skinned depend upon it he will have it scratched before the year is at an end.</P>

<P>Get you gone, and tell the driver to lay you on nine and thirty lashes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>QUACOU.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lud a mercy, Massah.
<STAGE>exit Quacou.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOVEMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am doomed to more torture and ridicule, Ma∣dam, than either of these men. Have you. Madam, forgot the hours of mutual endearments spent be∣tween us in England? is there no hope? or has this inhospitable climate blasted all remembrance, all tender recollection of my former attachment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOUISA.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>aside.</STAGE>
<P>Pride, thou just and noble support of my sex's dignity, leave me not at last, but still assist and bear me through this hour of trial!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WINSTONE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Forgive him, my dear; and let him see that though we are in this part of the world subject to sudden and violent fits of anger, yet we are as in∣capable of bearing malice as we are of bearing wrongs.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WHITMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now, now she is going to make a speech, hush.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOUISA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, there was a time I must own when my heart
<PB N="79" REF="80"/>
gloried in the affections of Mr. Lovemore; and though I was by the commands of my father torn from his vows to a country where I were often, and constantly made me yet out of compassion for him I refused both my hand and heart to those that requested them: such were once my senti∣ments towards you; but now insulted, rejected, what shall I say to your importunities?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WHITMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>That he must cross the seas twice every year for half a dozen years to come, before you will even let him kiss your hand.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WINSTONE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay then without further delay, I will give it him.
<STAGE>[gives his daughter's hand to Lovemore, who kneels and kisses it.]</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOVEMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is more than I deserve; my heart over∣flows with gratitude.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOUISA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Know then, Mr. Lovemore, since my father has e'en given me to your love, that I was endued with fortitude enough to stand against all the shocks of ridicule and derision which were thrown out at my lost beauty; yet the tender recollection of my first attachment revived all the latent sparks of passion in my breast, and has been the occasion of the sur∣prizing change you see.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOVEMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Transporting change! No more Miss Winstone, but my own dear, long lost maid.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WYNDHAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Harkee, friend, the cock has found an unex∣pected
<PB N="80" REF="81"/>
pearl upon the dunghill, and is now begin∣ning to crow.
<STAGE>here Captain Wyndham imitates the crowing of a cock.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WINSTONE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon my soul my pretty chick has turned the Captain into a cock, and set him a crowing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOVEMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>He means Sir, I suppose, to make me run away.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WINSTONE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes as the lion did before you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WHITMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes he frightened the dam, and now he means to terrify the cub.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WYNDHAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Her acceptance of him at last surprized me I as∣sure you not a little; for I expected her to have sent him back to England with a box on the ear.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WHITMORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>It's a pity she did not, ha! ha! ha! Lovemore adieu! We pity thee, my dear boy. Let us know when you give a dinner, and we will pity thee for the last time.
<STAGE>exeunt Wyndham and Whitmore.</STAGE></P>

<SPEAKER>LOUISA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Rakish reprobates!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WINSTONE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am happy, Mr. Lovemore, to find you join the two extremes, wildness and connubial love. May you be as happy as you deserve. Retire with me for the present; A marriage settlement shall be drawn agreeable to your wish, and every thing so disposed as to give you mutual and lasting satis∣faction.</P>
