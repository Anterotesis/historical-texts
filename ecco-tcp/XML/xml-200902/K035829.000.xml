<HEAD>DEDICATION. TO THOMAS HARRIS, ESQ.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR treatment to me has been so singularly kind and liberal, that it would be inflicting the severest punish∣ment on my pride, to oblige me to con∣ceal it from the world. I had been taught to believe, that without a patron amongst the great, or an established li∣terary same, it was next to an impossi∣bility to get a piece introduced on the stage: but you, Sir, have proved to me, that this complaint is groundless: tho' unknown and unprotected, your beha∣viour to me has been such as the most delicate mind could suggest, or the most powerful influence have procured me. If then you countenance thus warmly so humble a tribute as mine at the shrine of the muses, how much superior at∣tention must you bestow on the more elevated and sublime efforts of the
<PB N="iv" REF="3"/>
mind, when Thalia comes arrayed by the hand of Genius with resistless graces, or her weeping sister, in native fables with all the conflicting passions in her train. The encouragement you give to every dawn of talents, whilst it wins you the respect and esteem of the pub∣lic, must prove of the most essential ser∣vice to the cause of letters. Patronage and success often lend a degree of force and brilliancy to moderate abilities; but ripen a truly fine genius into immedi∣ate perfection. I have the honour to remain,</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE> <SIGNED>Your much obliged, And faithful humble servant, FREDERICK PILON.</SIGNED></CLOSER>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>PUBLIC taste has run so much of late on the French <HI>petite comedie</HI> of two <HI>acts,</HI> that it seems necessary to say something in justification of <HI>farce,</HI> to prevent its being tried by the too rigid rules of criticism. In this refined age, <HI>low</HI> and <HI>absurd,</HI> are terms of re∣proach heard to echo from the benches of the upper gallery; so that whoever attempts to raise a laugh by downright <HI>farce,</HI> must ex∣pect critics in all quarters of the house ready to damn him for attempting to put them in good humour.</P>
<P><HI>Farce</HI> has ever been considered so essentially different from <HI>comedy,</HI> that any incident in the latter bordering upon the <HI>extravagant,</HI> has been termed <HI>farcical</HI> or <HI>outré</HI> by way of dis∣crimination. This species of entertainment is certainly more a <HI>caricature</HI> than a <HI>faithful picture of nature</HI>—the outline is preserved but extended, and every tint of the colouring considerably heightened. For instance—can any thing be more improbable and extrava∣gant, than the plot and incidents of the Mock Doctor? yet this has been the production of two of the first comic geniusses this or any other country ever produced. It is not to be supposed that Moliere and Fielding were ig∣norant of the rules of the drama; nevertheless, in their best farces they totally lost fight of them, appearing to have nothing in view but whimsical characters and laughable situations.
<PB N="vi" REF="5"/>
The humour and characters of <HI>the Invasion</HI> in some places have been censured as low, but surely the same charge holds good against the the most celebrated writers. Smollett, Field∣ing, Gay, Cervantes, all descended to the hum∣ble walk of life in search of Humour, and never rejected her for the homeliness of her garb. It is true, that if painting low life be a fault, those distinguished wits were possessed of beauties sufficient to eclipse little spots in their reputa∣tion. The writer of <HI>the Invasion</HI> feels but too sensibly the humiliating distance he is thrown from them, and, that whatever his faults are, he has nothing to depend upon for hiding them except the candour of his readers. The following little entertainment he meant merely as a <HI>farce,</HI> and as such <HI>only</HI> he hopes it will be considered and judged of.</P>
<P>He cannot conclude without returning his warmest acknowledgments to Mr. Garrick for assistances in the Invasion, which have contributed more than the merit of the author to its success with the public.</P>
<P>The performers in general acquitted them∣selves with the greatest spirit and propriety; particularly Mr. Lee Lewes, who, by his speaking the prologue and his acting Came∣leon, proved that he was possessed of all those various and versatile powers which constitute the truly capital comedian.</P>

<LG>
<L>THE muse in change and fashion still delighting,</L>
<L>Now raves of nothing but of camps and fighting,</L>
<L>Of mines, of ambuscades, and heroes slain,</L>
<L>Arm'd cap-a-pie on the embattled plain</L>
<L>Of Covent-Garden, or of Drury-Lane.</L>
<L>One night a Camp by candle light she shews;</L>
<L>Next an Invasion, without wounds or blows.</L>
<L>Beneath the arches, our encampment nigh,</L>
<L>Where walking belles, and Irish chairmen ply;</L>
<L>Where play-bills spread, seem like a centinel,</L>
<L>To guard the entrance of the citadel;</L>
<L>A crowd, whose wonder our Invasion rais'd,</L>
<L>With curious comment on each play-bill gaz'd;</L>
<L>Expecting nothing less than war and plunder,</L>
<L>And cannon louder than the rattling thunder:</L>
<L>An honest tar, with his dear Sue in tow,</L>
<L>Whom he from Wapping brought to see the show;</L>
<L>Hearing debates run high upon this night,</L>
<L>Put in his word to set his neighbours right.</L>
<L>"Avast, my masters, and I'll let you know</L>
<L>"What these folks mean by their Invasion shew:</L>
<L>"Don't you perceive th' Invasion's all a skit,</L>
<L>"To laugh at Monsieurs for their want of wit.</L>
<L>"Invade us, boys! why sluice my English blood,</L>
<L>"And send me home with all my timbers wood;</L>
<L>"If I, Ben Block, with half the British fleet,</L>
<L>"Would not these Parley-vous most soundly beat!</L>
<L>"Aye, damn me, wou'd I, or I'd lose my life,</L>
<L>"And then the King, God bless him, keeps my wife."</L>
<L>An Irish blade, who heard this heart of oak,</L>
<L>Replied, "My honey, I believe you joke:</L>
<L>"Did not Monsieur Thurot, last war, sail post,</L>
<L>"T' invade Old England, on the Irish coast?</L>
<L>"Faith and he did, an hell had been to do,</L>
<L>"But that brave Elliot shot him thro' and thro';</L>
<L>"Which so surpriz'd him as along he cruiz'd,</L>
<L>"To fight no more, he begg'd to be excus'd!"</L>
<L>Thus Britons rudely that great spirit shew,</L>
<L>Which always conquer'd and chastis'd her foe;</L>
<L>That spirit of such energy divine,</L>
<L>Clouds and misfortunes make it brighter shine.</L>
<L><PB N="viii" REF="7"/>
Perfidious Gaul now feels this country's might;</L>
<L>Asham'd to yield, and yet afraid to fight.</L>
<L>Pursue your triumph, Britons, strike the blow,</L>
<L>That humbles in the dust your faithless foe;</L>
<L>That side which justice, strength, and valour take,</L>
<L>Honour and conquest never will forsake.</L>

<SPEAKER>Beauf.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have not seen Emily this month: as he knows she has a fortune of ten thousand pounds in∣dependent of him, he keeps her a close prisoner; and to such an excess does this military mania hur∣ry him, that, I believe in my conscience he would prefer a serjeant of invalids, or a Chelsea pensioner, to your discarded friend, for a son-in-law.</P>

ridicule, as a lawyer, I must incur, by going into the army. He continued inflexible; asserted Old England was in danger daily of an invasion, and that every man who had a regard for her laws and constitution, should now fight for them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cam.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then, Sir, it seems he is in great dread of an invasion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Beauf.</SPEAKER>
<P>In such dread of it, that he has got a ser∣jeant and a drummer, that are down here on a re∣cruiting party, to teach him his exercise—Nay, I am told he intends sinking a trench round Evergreen Hall, and converting it into a garrison.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>I suppose he's the jest of the whole county.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Beauf.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, faith, no—very few know any thing about him. Brighthelmstone, during the sea∣son, is too much engaged with scandal and gallantry—then his house standing so far out of the town—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Sdeath! if, instead of banishing me for faults he was guilty of himself at my age, he had clapped a sword into my hand, and bade me fight for my country, he'd have acted like an Englishman and a good father: but an old fellow of sixty, trou∣bled three or four times a year with the gout, to think of going into the army!—he may as well think of a wife.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Beauf.</SPEAKER>
<P>I suppose you have heard that your old aunt, Lady Catherine Rouge, passed this summer, for the first time, at his house. She, Sir, is my most formidable enemy. Would you believe it, Charles? The old lady actually made love to me; and because I did not return her overtures with all the warmth she expected, like a true woman, she most cordially hates me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cam.</SPEAKER>
<P>She does?—More shame for you, Sir, to put it in her power.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Beauf.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Camelion, sure you don't suppose I could make love to a woman old enough to be my grandmother!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="3" REF="12"/>
<SPEAKER>Cam.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, to your grandmother herself, provided that was the only method you had left to obtain the real mistress of your heart. Now, had I been in your situation, and she had been as withered as a mummy, without a tooth in her head, or a hair of any colour to boast of, I'd have been at her feet from morning till night, swore that she had a Cupid in every wrinkle, that I loved her more than Antony did Cleopatra, and that if the Goddess of Discord threw another golden apple upon earth, to be given to the fairest, and appointed me judge, her Ladyship, without having a tooth to eat it, should have had the pippin before to-morrow morning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Beauf. and Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha, ha, ha!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Beauf.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Cameleon, you are a wit; and, from some of your slights, I should conclude, a piece of a scholar.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cam.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is no matter what I am, Sir, I wish to serve my master, and serve you too, Sir; and I think I can do it, provided my master is not altogether so squeamish as his friend.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>What are you driving at, Cameleon?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cam.</SPEAKER>
<P>I only hope, Sir, that you are not so refined in your notions of beauty as Mr. Beaufort; and that, provided it is your interest, you can mistake the snow upon an old sapless trunk, for blossoms and green leaves, and swear you feel the heat of the Dog-days in the month of December. But to wave metaphor, I hope, Sir, you will think that Lady Catherine has still some charms left.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, you rascal, have you forgot she is my aunt?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cam.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your aunt! What then? Has not she a great deal of money? And don't you think it would be a pity to let it go out of the family? Has she ever seen you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not since I was eight years old, when, I re∣member, she has often taken me on her knee, pat∣ted
<PB N="4" REF="13"/>
my cheek, played with my ringlets, and called me her little Adonis.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cam.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then, Sir, you must now return the com∣pliment, you must take her upon your knee, pat her cheeks, play with her ringlets, and call her your full-grown Venus.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Psha! fool! this will never take. A wo∣man that has lived in the sphere she has—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cam.</SPEAKER>
<P>Will believe any handsome young fellow, who tells her he is love with her. The sphere she has lived in! 'Sdeath, Sir, do you suppose women of quality live in the sphere of Dian, or are all born under Virgo? It might have been so formerly, but the present race are certainly under the influ∣ence of warmer planets. A woman of quality ex∣pects lovers to the last moment of her life; and as the kings of France, from excess of respect, are sup∣posed never to die, so a woman of fashion, from ex∣cess of gallantry, is supposed never to cease to be beautiful. A woman such as Lady Catherine, like ice before the sun, will dissolve at the blaze which surrounds a fine young fellow.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>O your humble servant, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cam.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am right in my philosophy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Beau.</SPEAKER>
<P>I relish your scheme exceedingly, Came∣leon. The old lady, Charles, is as rich as a Jew, and can do any thing with your father. Now, if you play your cards skilfully, you may with ease draw her into such a ridiculous situation that she'll be glad to purchase your silence at any rate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cam.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, you have hit it. Make love to her, and afterwards discard me as a blockhead, or stone me for a false prophet, if it prove not the means of all your debts being paid, and you being reconciled to your father as firmly as ever. Here, waiter, bring pen, ink and paper.</P>

<P>I thank you, Cameleon, but that I know to be out of your power.</P>

<P>Don't think slightly of my power, till you are better acquainted with it. What would you think if I procured you an interview with Miss Evergreen this very afternoon?</P>

<P>None in the world.</P>

<SPEAKER>Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Impudent rascal! The next question, I sup∣pose you'll ask him is, whether he'll go on board wages.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cam.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then, Sir, I'll assume the character of the celebrated Enamel the dentist from London. I lived with him two years, and, whenever I please, we are as like as two eye teeth. You shall pass as my servant, and in this disguise we will visit Sir John, as recommended by Colonel Platoon, his par∣ticular friend in London, to give him a new set of teeth, and a left eye, that he may look like a sol∣dier, when he goes into the militia.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Beauf.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what end will this answer?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cam.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Sir, while I am amusing Sir John with all the fashionable jargon of a first-rate dentist, you will have an opportunity of conversing with your mistress, and of assuring her, that if she will consent, you will deliver her this night.</P>

<P>This night, Camelion!</P>

<P>This night, Sir, if there's faith in man.—You know he is always raving of an invasion: that's my engine. I'll unsold my plot on our way to Evergreen-Hall; you may depend, I think, on its success, when Sir John's character is considered; therefore employ all your eloquence with your mistress, for nothing but her disapprobation of our plan can defeat it.</P>

<P>If it succeeds, I will make your fortune.</P>

<P>Why, sirrah, do you think I want your as∣sistance to write a letter?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cam.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, lord Sir, a love letter is such a dif∣ferent kind of letter from all other letters, that without great practice, there is no such thing as writing one, especially to an elderly lady—for after a certain period, the taste becomes so callous, it relishes nothing that is not seasoned very high—Have you put darts and flames enough into it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Aye, enough to burn the messenger's fin∣gers.</P>

<SPEAKER>Lady C.</SPEAKER>
<P>But it is no wonder I look ill—I have have not had an hour's rest—It was three, you know, before I got into bed, and I had scarce clos'd my eyes, when a concert of rooks and pigeons began to serenade me, and kept me awake till six—these soft musicians had scarce given me a little respite, when the grenadiers march struck up diredtly un∣der my window—then pop, pop, went the mus∣quets for three or four hours, tearing my poor head to pieces, till what with the noise and fretting, I almost lost my senses.</P>

<P>Lord, your Ladyship, it was Sir John and his servants that made all that racket and uproar—He has got a serjeant and a drummer from Bright∣helmstone to teach him his exercise—If your La∣dyship was to see him, and Roger the carter, and William the postillion, marching and desiling about, and turning out their toes, and handling their arms, you'd die with laughing.

<P>In a very awkward manner—The military spirit, you know, is grown so fashionable, that Miss Harriet absolutely challenged her; and they would actually have sought, only the person whom Lady Sophia had trusted to provide pistols, disco∣vered the whole affair to my Lord, who went im∣mediately to a magistrate, and had both the ladies bound over.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha, ha, ha! brave Harriet! what a loss has the king sustain'd in her being oblig'd to wear a petticoat?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Harriet's conduct was punctiliously ho∣nourable—She sneer'd at the ridiculous ceremony of binding over; but in order to evade it, set off for the Netherlands about ten days ago, leaving this laconic billet with Lady Sophia—"You'll hear of "me at Lisle."</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady C.</SPEAKER>
<P>And did Lady Sophia follow her?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Only she was taken in labour, she would; but it is thought, that as soon as she is able to travel, she will go off post, to prevent her honour being question'd.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Lady C.</SPEAKER>
<P>You certainly, Brussels, are a most en∣tertaining creature, your conversation is a perfect cordial—any thing new in your own way?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brus.</SPEAKER>
<P>They are quite the ton, and all my own invention—So many accidents happen'd to the heads of my customers this summer from light∣ning, that I have contriv'd caps with conductors in them, which will enable a lady to walk with her head two yards high in the most violent thunder storm without danger.</P>

<P>No—I have been out of rumps these six weeks; indeed I don't think it worth wasting cork on 'em now—not one called for from morning till night—I have remarked that since the French war was first talk'd of, and so many new regiments rais∣ed, it has been quite unfashionable to make any un∣natural addition to the shapes.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir J.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now we only want a couple of field∣pieces, and our review will be complete.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Drill.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have you ever a pair of jack boots in the house?—I think we might make a shift with them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir J.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you think they will stand the firing?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Drill.</SPEAKER>
<P>Damme, I'll engage for them as well as if they had tower mark on—I'll tell you a story of a jack boot—The first battle I was ever in, being a mere boy, as a man may say, you must know I was devilishly frightened; but a good-natur'd grenadier observing my confusion, whips me off a jack boot from the leg of a trooper, whose brains were just blown out, and intrench'd me up to the chin in it, in the twirling of a ramrod: as soon as I found myself, Sir, safely garrisoned in the boot, I bent my knees, to take every advantage of my post, and damn me if I did not maintain it with the greatest steadiness till the battle was over, without receiving a single wound but one, and where do you think that was?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir J.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps in the toes—that part of a jack boot I know is apt to go first.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Drill.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was in the lace of the hind sirk of my hat, which happen'd to be too much exposed above the boot to the fire of the enemy.—What do you think of a jack boot now?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tat.</SPEAKER>
<P>Split my drum sticks, how you do fling the hatchet, Serjeant!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Drill.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why do you doubt my word, you dog! I

tell you what, Sir John, there's not a man in the regiment but would swear to it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tir J.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't doubt it—I don't doubt it at all, Mr. Drill—for my part, I think the story highly probable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tat.</SPEAKER>
<P>Probable, Sir! if he gets any body to say it is true but himself, I'll suffer my braces to be cut on a review day, and be content with the black hole for my dining-room.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Drill.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, you rascal, you know I can't; the entire corps I belonged to were all cut to pieces; therefore he knows I have not a witness living to confront him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tat.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is another Fontenoy, serjeant; he says Sir, he was at the battle of Fontenoy at eight years old.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Drill.</SPEAKER>
<P>So I was, sirrah—I went there, with a fife in my hand, and behaved so well, that I was pro∣moted to a drum as soon as ever I was able to carry one, and had the honour of scourging the whole re∣giment.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Roger.</SPEAKER>
<P>Drawing them on, your worship! ecod I defy anybody to do that; for they are as stiff as a deal board, and one of them would be enough to boot such a one as I from head to foot.</P>

<P>Why, Sir, about half a year ago the coal-box was burnt, and being afraid to tell your wor∣ship, we cut off the foot of one of those old boots, thinking you would never wear them, and so made a coal box of the leg, saving your worship's pre∣sence.</P>

<SPEAKER>Sir J.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, but I have changed my mind; the fellow was mean enough to prefer fighting with words and parchment in Westminster Hall, to the glorious danger of the field of battle. If he had pur∣chased a pair of colours with his last shilling, I would have given you to him at once, for he might one day become a general; but he shall never have a daughter of mine, till he acquires spirit enough to consider a good soldier a better character than the Lord Chancellor.</P>

<P>But now I mention water glasses, it reminds me of a whimsical accident which happen'd last week at Lord Whiffle's. His Lordship had a large party to dine with him, all people of tip top fa∣shion and my customers; could not have swallowed a mouthful for all that but for me; amongst others, Lady Mary Made-up, who had got in that day an entire new set upon trial from Signor Grinini, they were highly finished, and Lady Mary did the artist ample justice, for she was upon the broad grin du∣ring the whole time of dinner.</P>

<P>Oh! that's a mark of good breeding among your people of fashion.</P>

<P>After dinner as she was sipping from her water glass, an aukward booby of a servant jostled her elbow, and drove the edge of the glass with

such violence against her fore teeth, that the whole set bounced into her lap in a twinkling—Every bo∣dy stared, not so much at the accident (as it was one might have happened to most of themselves) as at the prodigious alteration it made in Lady Ma∣ry—her cheeks which appeared as round and as plump as a peach, shrunk into wrinkles, her lips fell in, her nose and chin approached, and from a fine blooming girl of five and twenty—before the cloth was removed, she was hagged into an antiquated maiden of threescore.</P>

<P>Ah Sir! if you had seen me when I came on shore this morning—all the cocks of my hat were shot away, so that it look'd like a bowl or a bason on my head; several balls were lodged in the skirts of my coat; my trowsers had more holes in 'em than a cullendar, and I should have lost my thigh by a musquet ball, but for a tobacco box in my breeches pocket: however, as if that ball had a spight against me, it wheeled afterwards into the forecastle, penetrated the door of a locker, and broke into fritters a <HI>cardivine</HI> of choice cognac I had just purchased from a smuggler.</P>

<P>They told you they were coming to Brighthelmstone?</P>

<P>They are secure, Sir. I purchased their loyalty with three of the five guineas you gave me to be employed in secret services. I gave half a crown to a press gang for the hire of their flag till to-morrow morning.—I have en∣gaged the master of a puppet-show to beat the drum, and his merry-Andrew, in case of necessity, to act the part of a French brigadier general; then,
<PB N="36" REF="48"/>
I have a large party of fishermen for soldiers; and, what few generals can say, have satisfied my whole army with twenty shillings—But dear masters, begone, and when I wave my hand, come to me.</P>

<P>—Now general Cameleon art thou on the eve of finishing a most glorious campaign—If I reduce this garrison, I shall get into good snug winter quarters for the rest of my life. But hold, hold! what if I should be obliged to raise the siege? What if the enemy should make a fally, and fairly defeat me? why then "farewell to the little good my master will "do for me! farewell the good hot dinner! the "ear piercing bell! the royal firloin, and all " pride, pomp, and prospect of good eating! and "oh ye round-paunch'd landlords, whole fiery "faces dread Jove's red lightning counterfeit, "farewell! Cameleon's wages and his place are "gone!"</P>
