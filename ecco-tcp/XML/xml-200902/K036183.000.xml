<P>IF you were only one of the finest writers of your time, you would probably have escaped the trouble of this address, which is drawn on you, less by the lustre of your understanding, than by the amiable qualities of your heart.</P>
<P>As the following pages are written with an humble but earnest wish, to promote the interests of virtue, as far
<PB REF="4"/>as the very limited abilities of the au∣thor allow; there is, I flatter myself, a peculiar propriety in inscribing them to you, Madam, who, while your works convey instruction and delight to the best-informed of the other sex, furnish, by your conduct, an admi∣rable pattern of life and manners to your own. And I can with truth re∣mark, that those graces of conversation, which would be the first praise of al∣most any other character, constitute but an inferior part of yours,</P>

<PB REF="6"/>
<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>IT is with the utmost diffidence that the following pages are sub∣mitted to the inspection of the Public: yet, however the limited abi∣lities of the author may have prevented her from succeeding to her wish in the execution of her present attempt, she humbly trusts that the uprightness of her intention will procure it a candid and favourable reception. The fol∣lowing little Essays are chiefly calcu∣lated for the younger part of her own
<PB N="2" REF="7"/>sex, who, she flatters herself, will not esteem them the less, because they were written immediately for their service. She by no means pretends to have composed a regular system of morals, or a finished plan of conduct: she has only endeavoured to make a few re∣marks on such circumstances as seemed to her susceptible of some improve∣ment, and on such subjects as she ima∣gined were particularly interesting to young ladies, on their first introduc∣tion into the world. She hopes they will not be offended if she has occa∣sionally pointed out certain qualities, and suggested certain tempers, and dispositions, as <HI>peculiarly feminine,</HI> and hazarded some observations which na∣turally arose from the subject, on the different characters which mark the sexes. And here again she takes the liberty to repeat that these distinctions
<PB N="3" REF="8"/>cannot be too nicely maintained; for besides those important qualities com∣mon to both, each sex has its respec∣tive, appropriated qualifications, which would cease to be meritorious, the in∣stant they ceased to be appropriated. Nature, propriety, and custom have prescribed certain bounds to each; bounds which the prudent and the candid will never attempt to break down; and indeed it would be highly impolitic to annihilate distinctions from which each acquires excellence, and to attempt innovations, by which both would be losers.</P>
<P>WOMEN therefore never understand their own interests so little, as when they affect those qualities and accom∣plishments, from the want of which they derive their highest merit. <Q>The <HI>porcelain</HI> clay of human kind,</Q> says
<PB N="4" REF="9"/>an admired writer, speaking of the sex. Greater delicacy evidently implies greater fragility; and this weakness, na∣tural and moral, clearly points out the necessity of a superior degree of caution, retirement, and reserve.</P>
<P>If the author may be allowed to keep up the allusion of the poet, just quoted, she would ask if we do not put the finest vases, and the costliest images in places of the greatest secu∣rity, and most remote from any pro∣bability of accident, or destruction? By being so situated, they find their protection in their weakness, and their safety in their delicacy. This meta∣phor is far from being used with a de∣sign of placing young ladies in a tri∣vial, unimportant light; it is only introduced to insinuate, that where there is more beauty, and more weak∣ness,
<PB N="5" REF="10"/>there should be greater circum∣spection, and superior prudence.</P>
<P>MEN, on the contrary, are formed for the more public exhibitions on the great theatre of human life. Like the stronger and more substantial wares, they derive no injury, and lose no polish by being always exposed, and engaged in the constant commerce of the world. It is their proper element, where they respire their natural air, and exert their noblest powers, in situations which call them into action. They were intended by Providence for the bustling scenes of life; to appear terrible in arms, useful in commerce, shining in counsels.</P>
<P>THE Author fears it will be hazard∣ing a very bold remark, in the opi∣nion of many ladies, when she adds,
<PB N="6" REF="11"/>that the female mind, in general, does not appear capable of attaining so high a degree of perfection in science as the male. Yet she hopes to be for∣given when she observes also, that as it does not seem to derive the chief portion of its excellence from extra∣ordinary abilities of this kind, it is not at all lessened by the imputation of not possessing them. It is readily al∣lowed, that the sex have lively ima∣ginations, and those exquisite percep∣tions of the beautiful and defective, which come under the denomination of Taste. But pretensions to that strength of intellect, which is requisite to pe∣netrate into the abstruser walks of li∣terature, it is presumed they will rea∣dily relinquish. There are green pastures, and pleasant vallies, where they may wander with safety to themselves, and delight to others. They may cul∣tivate
<PB N="7" REF="12"/>the roses of imagination, and the valuable fruits of morals and criti∣cism; but the steeps of Parnassus sew, comparatively, have attempted to scale with success. And when it is consider∣ed, that many languages, and many sciences, must contribute to the per∣fection of poetical composition, it will appear less strange. The lofty Epic, the pointed Satire, and the more dar∣ing and successful slights of the Tragic Muse, seem reserved for the bold ad∣venturers of the other sex.</P>
<P>NOR does this assertion, it is appre∣hended, at all injure the interests of the women; they have other preten∣sions, on which to value themselves, and other qual<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ties much better calcu∣lated to answer their particular pur∣poses. We are enamoured of the soft strains of the Sicilian and the Mantuan
<PB N="8" REF="13"/>Muse, while, to the sweet notes of the pastoral reed, they sing the Conten∣tions of the Shepherds, the Blessings of Love, or the innocent Delights of ru∣ral Life. Has it ever been ascribed to them as a defect, that their Eclogues do not treat of active scenes, of busy cities, and of wasting war? No: their simplicity is their perfection, and they are only blamed when they have too little of it.</P>
<P>On the other hand, the lofty bards who strung their bolder harps to higher measures, and sung the <HI>Wrath</HI> of <HI>Pe∣leus' Son,</HI> and <HI>Man's first Disobedience,</HI> have never been censured for want of sweetness and refinement. The sub∣lime, the nervous, and the masculine, characterise their compositions; as the beautiful, the soft, and the delicate, mark those of the others. Grandeur,
<PB N="9" REF="14"/>dignity, and force, distinguish the one species; ease, simplicity, and purity, the other. Both shine from their na∣tive, distinct, unborrowed merits, not from those which are foreign, adven∣titious, and unnatural. Yet those ex∣cellencies, which make up the essential and constituent parts of poetry, they have in common.</P>
<P>WOMEN have generally quicker per∣ceptions; men have juster sentiments. —Women consider how things may be prettily said; men how they may be properly said.—In women, (young ones at least) speaking accompanies, and sometimes precedes reflection; in men, reflection is the antecedent.— Women speak to shine or to please; men, to convince or confute.—Wo∣men admire what is brilliant; men what is solid.—Women prefer an ex∣temporaneous
<PB N="10" REF="15"/>sally of wit, or a spark∣ling effusion of fancy, before the most accurate reasoning, or the most labo∣rious investigation of facts. In lite∣rary composition, women are pleased with point, turn, and antithesis; men with observation, and a just deduc∣tion of effects from their causes.— Women are fond of incident, men of argument.—Women admire passionate∣ly, men approve cautiously.—One sex will think it betrays a want of feel∣ing to be moderate in their applause, the other will be afraid of exposing a want of judgment by being in rap∣tures with any thing.—Men refuse to give way to the emotions they actu∣ally feel, while women sometimes af∣fect to be transported beyond what the occasion will justify.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="16"/>As a farther confirmation of what has been advanced on the different bent of the understanding in the sexes, it may be observed, that we have heard of many female wits, but never of one female logician—of many admirable writers of memoirs, but ne∣ver of one chronologer.—In the bound∣less and aërial regions of romance, and in that fashionable species of compo∣sition which succeeded it, and which carries a nearer approximation to the manners of the world, the women cannot be excelled: this imaginary soil they have a peculiar talent for cul∣tivating, because here, Invention labours more, and judgment less.</P>
<P>THE merit of this kind of writing consists in the <HI>vraisemblance</HI> to real life as to the events themselves, with
<PB N="12" REF="17"/>a certain elevation in the narrative, which places them, if not above what is natural, yet above what is common. It farther consists in the art of inte∣resting the tender feelings by a pathe∣tic representation of those minute, en∣dearing, domestic circumstances, which take captive the soul before it has time to shield itself with the armour of reflection. To amuse, rather than to instruct, or to instruct indirectly by short inferences, drawn from a long concatenation of circumstances, is at once the business of this sort of com∣position, and one of the characteristics of female genius <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">THE author does not apprehend it makes against her GENERAL position, that this nation can boast a female critic, poet, historian, linguist, philosopher, and moralist, equal to most of the other sex. To these particular instances others might be adduced; but it is presumed, that they only stand as exceptions against the rule, without tending to invalidate the rule itself.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="18"/>IN short, it appears that the mind in each sex has some natural kind of bias, which constitutes a distinction of character, and that the happiness of both depends, in a great measure, on the preservation and observance of this distinction. For where would be the superior pleasure and satisfaction resulting from mixed conversation, if this difference were abolished? If the qualities of both were invariably and exactly the same, no benefit or enter∣tainment would arise from the tedious and insipid uniformity of such an in∣tercourse; whereas considerable ad∣vantages are reaped from a select so∣ciety of both sexes. The rough an∣gles and asperities of male manners are imperceptibly filed, and gradually worn smooth, by the polishing of fe∣male conversation, and the refining of female taste; while the ideas of wo∣men
<PB N="14" REF="19"/>acquire strength and solidity, by their associating with sensible, intel∣ligent, and judicious men.</P>
<P>ON the whole, (even if fame be the object of pursuit) is it not better to succeed as women, than to fail as men? To shine, by walking honourably in the road which nature, custom, and education seem to have marked out, rather than to counteract them all, by moving awkwardly in a path diame∣trically opposite? To be good origi∣nals, rather than bad imitators? In a word, to be excellent women, rather than indifferent men?</P>

<HEAD>ON DISSIPATION.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q>DOGLIE CERTE, ALLEGREZZE INCERTE!</Q>
<BIBL>PETRARCA.</BIBL>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>AS an argument in favour of mo∣dern manners, it has been plead∣ed, that the softer vices of Luxury and Dissipation, belong rather to gen∣tle and yielding tempers, than to such as are rugged and ferocious: that they are vices which increase civili∣zation,
<PB N="16" REF="21"/>and tend to promote refine∣ment, and the cultivation of human∣nity.</P>
<P>BUT this is an assertion, the truth of which the experience of all ages contradicts. Nero was not less a ty∣rant for being a fiddler: He <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Emperor Caligula.</NOTE> who wished the whole Roman people had but one neck, that he might dispatch them at a blow, was himself the most debauched man in Rome; and Sydney and Russel were condemned to bleed under the most barbarous, though most dissipated and voluptuous, reign that ever disgraced the annals of Britain.</P>
<P>THE love of dissipation is, I believe, allowed to be the reigning evil of the present day. It is an evil which many
<PB N="17" REF="22"/>content themselves with regretting, without seeking to redress. A dissi∣pated life is censured in the very act of dissipation, and prodigality of time is as gravely declaimed against at the card table, as in the pulpit.</P>
<P>THE lover of dancing censures the amusements of the theatre for their dulness, and the gamester blames them both for their levity. She, whose whole soul is swallowed up in "<HI>opera exta∣cies,"</HI> is astonished, that her acquaint∣ance can spend whole nights in prey∣ing, like harpies, on the fortunes of their fellow-creatures; while the grave sober sinner, who passes her pale and anxious vigils, in this fashionable sort of pillaging, is no less surprised how the other can waste her precious time in hearing sounds for which she has
<PB N="18" REF="23"/>no taste, in a language she does not understand.</P>
<P>IN short, every one seems convinced, that the evil so much complained of does really exist somewhere, though all are inwardly persuaded that it is not with themselves. All desire a general reformation, but few will listen to pro∣posals of particular amendment; the body must be restored, but each limb begs to remain as it is; and accusations which concern all, will be likely to af∣fect none. They think that sin, like matter, is divisible, and that what is scattered among so many, cannot ma∣terially affect any one; and thus indi∣viduals contribute separately to that evil which they in general lament.</P>
<P>THE prevailing manners of an age depend more than we are aware, or
<PB N="19" REF="24"/>are willing to allow, on the conduct of the women; this is one of the prin∣cipal hinges on which the great ma∣chine of human society turns. Those who allow the influence which female graces have, in contributing to polish the manners of men, would do well to reflect how great an influence fe∣male morals must also have on their conduct. How much then is it to be regretted, that the British ladies should ever sit down contented to polish, when they are able to reform, to entertain, when they might instruct, and to daz∣zle for an hour, when they are candi∣dates for eternity!</P>
<P>UNDER the dispensation of Maho∣met's law, indeed, these mental ex∣cellencies cannot be expected, because the women are shut out from all op∣portunities of instruction, and excluded
<PB N="20" REF="25"/>from the endearing pleasures of a de∣lightful and equal society; and, as a charming poet sings, are taught to believe, that
<Q><L>For their inferior natures</L>
<L>Form'd to delight, and happy by delighting,</L>
<L>Heav'n has reserv'd no future paradise,</L>
<L>But bids them rove the paths of bliss, secure</L>
<L>Of total death, and careless of hereaster.</L>
<BIBL>IRENE.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>THESE act consistently in studying none but exterior graces, in cultivat∣ing only personal attractions, and in trying to lighten the intolerable bur∣den of time, by the most frivolous and vain amusements. They act in consequence of their own blind be∣lief, and the tyranny of their despotic masters; for they have neither the free∣dom of a present choice, nor the pro∣spect of a future being.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="26"/>BUT in this land of civil and reli∣gious liberty, where there is as little despotism exercised over the minds, as over the persons of women, they have every liberty of choice, and every opportunity of improvement; and how greatly does this increase their obli∣gation to be exemplary in their gene∣ral conduct, attentive to the govern∣ment of their families, and instrumental to the good order of society!</P>
<P>SHE who is at a loss to find amuse∣ments at home, can no longer apo∣logize for her dissipation abroad, by saying she is deprived of the benefit and the pleasure of books; and she who regrets being doomed to a state of dark and gloomy ignorance, by the injustice, or tyranny of the men, com∣plains of an evil which does not exist.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="27"/>IT is a question frequently in the mouths of illiterate and dissipated fe∣males— "What good is there in read∣ing? To what end does it conduce?" It is, however, too obvious to need in∣sisting on, that unless perverted, as the best things may be, reading an∣swers many excellent purposes beside the great leading one, and is perhaps the safest remedy for dissipation. She who dedicates a portion of her leisure to useful reading, feels her mind in a constant progressive state of improve∣ment, whilst the mind of a dissipated woman is continually losing ground. An active spirit rejoiceth, like the sun, to run his daily course, while indo∣lence, like the dial of Ahaz, goes backwards. The advantages which the understanding receives from polite literature, it is not here necessary to enumerate; its effects on the moral
<PB N="23" REF="28"/>temper is the present object of consi∣deration. The remark may perhaps be thought too strong, but I believe it is true, that next to religious influ∣ences, an habit of study is the most probable preservative of the virtue of young persons. Those who cultivate letters have rarely a strong passion for promiscuous visiting, or dissipated so∣ciety; study therefore induces a relish for domestic life, the most desirable temper in the world for women. Stu∣dy, as it rescues the mind from an inordinate fondness for gaming, dress, and public amusements, is an oeco∣nomical propensity; for a lady may read at much less expence than she can play at cards; as it requires some ap∣plication, it gives the mind an habit of industry; as it is a relief against that mental disease, which the French emphatically call <HI>ennui,</HI> it cannot fail
<PB N="24" REF="29"/>of being beneficial to the temper and spirits, I mean in the moderate degree in which ladies are supposed to use it; as an enemy to indolence, it becomes a social virtue; as it demands the full exertion of our talents, it grows a ra∣tional duty; and when directed to the knowledge of the Supreme Being, and his laws, it rises into an act of reli∣gion.</P>
<P>THE rage for reformation commonly shews itself in a violent zeal for sup∣pressing what is wrong, rather than in a prudent attention to establish what is right; but we shall never obtain a fair garden merely by rooting up weeds, we must also plant flowers; for the natural richness of the soil we have been clearing will not suffer it to lie barren, but whether it shall be vainly or beneficially prolific, depends on the
<PB N="25" REF="30"/>culture. What the present age has gained on one side, by a more enlarged and liberal way of thinking, seems to be lost on the other, by excessive free∣dom and unbounded indulgence. Know∣ledge is not, as heretofore, confined to the dull cloyster, or the gloomy college, but disseminated, to a cer∣tain degree, among both sexes and almost all ranks. The only misfor∣tune is, that these opportunities do not seem to be so wisely improved, or turned to so good an account as might be wished. Books of a pernicious, idle, and frivolous sort, are too much multiplied, and it is from the very redundancy of them that true know∣ledge is so scarce, and the habit of dissipation so much increased.</P>
<P>IT has been remarked, that the pre∣vailing character of the present age is
<PB N="26" REF="31"/>not that of gross immorality: but if this is meant of those in the higher walks of life, it is easy to discern, that there can be but little merit in abstaining from crimes which there is but little temptation to commit. It is however to be feared, that a gra∣dual defection from piety, will in time draw after it all the bad conse∣quences of more active vice; for whe∣ther mounds and fences are suddenly destroyed by a sweeping torrent, or worn away through gradual neglect, the effect is equally destructive. As a rapid fever and a consuming hectic are alike fatal to our natural health, so are flagrant immorality and torpid in∣dolence to our moral well-being.</P>
<P>THE philosophical doctrine of the slow recession of bodies from the sun, is a lively image of the reluctance with
<PB N="27" REF="32"/>which we first abandon the light of virtue. The beginning of folly, and the first entrance on a dissipated life cost some pangs to a well disposed heart; but it is surprising to she how soon the progress ceases to be impeded by reflection, or slackened by remorse. For it is in moral as in natural things, the motion in minds as well as bodies is accelerated by a nearer approach to the centre to which they are tending. If we recede slowly at first setting out, we advance rapidly in our future course; and to have begun to be wrong, is already to have made a great progress.</P>
<P>A CONSTANT habit of amusement relaxes the tone of the mind, and ren∣ders it totally incapable of application, study, or virtue. Dissipation not only indisposes it votaries to every thing
<PB N="28" REF="33"/>useful and excellent, but disqualifies them for the enjoyment of pleasure it∣self. It softens the soul so much, that the most superficial employment be∣comes a labour, and the slightest in∣convenience an agony. The luxurious Sybarite must have lost all sense of real enjoyment, and all relish for true gratification, before he complained that he could not sleep, because the rose leaves lay double under him.</P>
<P>LUXURY and dissipation, soft and gentle as their approaches are, and silently as they throw their silken chains about the heart, enslave it more than the most active and turbulent vices. The mightiest conquerors have been conquered by these unarmed foes: the flowery fetters are fastened, before they are felt. The blandishments of Circe were more fatal to the mariners of
<PB N="29" REF="34"/>Ulysses, than the strength of Poly∣pheme, or the brutality of the Laes∣trigons. Hercules, after he had cleansed the Augean stable, and per∣formed all the other labours enjoined him by Euristheus, found himself a slave to the softnesses of the heart; and he, who wore a club and a lion's skin in the cause of virtue, conde∣scended to the most effeminate employ∣ments to gratify a criminal weakness. Hannibal, who vanquished mighty nations, was himself overcome by the love of pleasure; and he who despised cold, and want, and danger, and death on the Alps, was conquered and un∣done by the dissolute indulgences of Capua.</P>
<P>BEFORE the hero of the most beau∣tiful and virtuous romance that ever was written, I mean Telemachus,
<PB N="30" REF="35"/>landed on the island of Cyprus, he un∣fortunately lost his prudent compa∣nion, Mentor, in whom wisdom is so finely personisied. At sirst he beheld with horror the wanton and dissolute manners of the voluptuous inhabitants; the ill effects of their example were not immediate: he did not fall into the commission of glaring enormities; but his virtue was secretly and imper∣ceptibly undermined, his heart was softened by their pernicious society, and the nerve of resolution was slack∣ened: he every day beheld with di∣minished indignation the worship which was offered to Venus; the disorders of luxury and prophaneness became less and less terrible, and the infectious air of the country enfeebled his cou∣rage, and relaxed his principles. In short, he had ceased to love virtue long before he thought of committing
<PB N="31" REF="36"/>actual vice; and the duties of a manly piety were burdensome to him, before he was so debased as to offer perfumes, and burn incense on the altar of the licentious goddess. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">NOTHING can be more admirable than the man∣ner in which this allegory is conducted; and the whole work, not to mention its images, machinery, and other poetical beautics, is written in the very sinest strain of morality. In this latter respect it is evidently superior to the works of the ancients, the moral of which is frequently tainted by the grossness of their mythology. Something of the purity of the Christian religion may be discovered even in Fene∣lon's heathens, and they catch a tincture of piety in passing through the hands of that amiable prelate</NOTE>,</P>
<P><Q>LET us crown ourselves with rose∣buds before they be withered,</Q> said Solomon's libertine. Alas! he did not reflect that they withered in the very gathering. The roses of pleasure sel∣dom last long enough to adorn the brow
<PB N="32" REF="37"/>of him who plucks them; for they are the only roses which do not retain their sweetness after they have lost their beauty.</P>
<P>THE heathen poets often pressed on their readers the necessity of consider∣ing the shortness of life, as an incen∣tive to pleasure and voluptuousness; lest the season for indulging in them should pass unimproved. The dark and uncertain notions, not to say the absolute disbelief, which they enter∣tained of a future state, is the only apology that can be offered for this reasoning. But while we censure their tenets, let us not adopt their errors; errors which would be infinitely more inexcusable in us, who, from the clearer views which revelation has given us, shall not have their igno∣rance or their doubts to plead. It
<PB N="33" REF="38"/>were well if we availed ourselves of that portion of their precept, which inculcates the improvement of every moment of our time, but not like them to dedicate the moments so redeemed to the pursuit of sensual and perishable pleasures, but to the securing of those which are spiritual in their nature, and eternal in their duration.</P>
<P>IF, indeed, like the miserable <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Struldbrugs. See Voyage to Laputa.</NOTE> be∣ings imagined by Swift, with a view to cure us of the irrational desire after immoderate length of days, we were condemned to a wretched earthly im∣mortality, we should have an excuse for spending some portion of our time in dissipation, as we might then pre∣tend, with some colour of reason, that we proposed, at a distant period, to
<PB N="34" REF="39"/>enter on a better course of action. Or if we never formed any such resolution, it would make no material difference to beings, whose state was already un∣alterably fixed. But of the scanty portion of days assigned to our lot, not one should be lost in weak and irreso∣lute procrastination.</P>
<P>THOSE who have not yet determined on the side of vanity, who, like Her∣cules, (before he knew the queen of Lydia, and had learnt to spin) have not resolved on their choice between VIRTUE and PLEASURE, may reflect, that it is still in their power to imitate that hero in his noble choice, and in his virtuous rejection. They may also reflect with grateful triumph, that Christianity furnishes them with a bet∣ter guide than the tutor of Alcides,
<PB N="35" REF="40"/>and with a surer light than the doc∣trines of pagan philosophy.</P>
<P>IT is far from my design severely to condemn the innocent pleasures of life: I would only beg leave to observe, that those which are criminal should never be allowed; and that even the most innocent will, by immoderate use, soon cease to be so.</P>
<P>THE women of this country were not sent into the world to shun society, but to embellish it; they were not designed for wilds and soli∣tudes, but for the amiable and endear∣ing offices of social life. They have useful stations to fill, and important characters to sustain. They are of a religion which does not impose pe∣nances, but enjoins duties; a religion of perfect purity, but of perfect bene∣volence
<PB N="36" REF="41"/>also. A religion which does not condemn its followers to indolent seclusion from the world, but assigns them the more dangerous, though more honourable province, of living uncorrupted in it. In fine, a religion, which does not direct them to fly from the multitude, that they may do no∣thing, but which positively forbids them to follow a multitude to do evil.</P>

<HEAD>THOUGHTS ON CONVERSATION.</HEAD>
<P>IT has been advised, and by very respectable authorities too, that in conversation women should carefully conceal any knowledge or learning they may happen to possess. I own, with submission, that I do not see ei∣ther the necessity or propriety of this
<PB N="38" REF="43"/>advice. For if a young lady has that discretion and modesty, without which all knowledge is little worth, she will never make an ostentatious parade of it, because she will rather be intent on acquiring more, than on displaying what she has.</P>
<P>I AM at a loss to know why a young female is instructed to exhibit, in the most advantageous point of view, her skill in music, her singing, dancing, taste in dress, and her acquaintance with the most fashionable games and amusements, while her piety is to be anxiously concealed, and her knowledge affectedly disavowed, lest the former should draw on her the appellation of an enthusiast, or the latter that of a pedant.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="44"/>IN regard to knowledge, why should she for ever affect to be on her guard, lest she should be found guilty of a small portion of it? She need be the less solicitous about it, as it seldom proves to be so very considerable as to excite astonishment or admiration: for, after all the acquisitions which her talents and her studies have enabled her to make, she will, generally speak∣ing, be found to have less of what is called <HI>learning,</HI> than a common school∣boy.</P>
<P>IT would be to the last degree pre∣sumptuous and absurd, for a young woman to pretend to give the <HI>ton</HI> to the company; to interrupt the pleasure of others, and her own opportunity of improvement, by talking when she ought to listen; or to introduce sub∣jects out of the common road, in or∣der
<PB N="40" REF="45"/>to shew her own wit, or expose the want of it in others: but were the sex to be totally silent when any topic of literature happens to be discussed in their presence, conversation would lose much of its vivacity, and society would be robbed of one of its most interesting charms.</P>
<P>How easily and effectually may a well-bred woman promote the most useful and elegant conversation, almost without speaking a word! for the modes of speech are scarcely more variable than the modes of silence. The silence of listless ignorance, and the silence of sparkling intelligence, are perhaps as separately marked, and as distinctly expressed, as the same feelings could have been by the most unequivocal language. A woman, in a company where she has the least influence, may
<PB N="41" REF="46"/>promote any subject by a profound and invariable attention, which shews that she is pleased with it, and by an illuminated countenance, which proves she understands it. This obliging at∣tention is the most flattering encourage∣ment in the world to men of sense and letters, to continue any topic of in∣struction or entertainment they happen to be engaged in: it owed its intro∣duction perhaps to accident, the best introduction in the world for a subject of ingenuity, which, though it could not have been formally proposed with∣out pedantry, may be continued with ease and good humour; but which will be frequently and effectually stop∣ped by the listlessness, inattention, or whispering of silly girls, whose weari∣ness betrays their ignorance, and whose impatience exposes their ill-breeding. A polite man, however deeply inte∣rested
<PB N="42" REF="47"/>in the subject on which he is conversing, catches at the slightest hint to have done: a look is a sufficient intimation, and if a pretty simpleton, who sits near him, seems <HI>distraite,</HI> he puts an end to his remarks, to the great regret of the reasonable part of the company, who perhaps might have gained more improvement by the con∣tinuance of such a conversation, than a week's reading would have yielded them; for it is such company as this, that give an edge to each other's wit, "as iron sharpeneth iron."</P>
<P>THAT silence is one of the great arts of conversation is allowed by Cicero himself, who says, there is not only an art but even an eloquence in it. And this opinion is confirmed by a great mo∣dern, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lord Bacon.</NOTE>, in the following little anecdote from one of the ancients.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="48"/>WHEN many Grecian philosophers had a solemn meeting before the am∣bassador of a foreign prince, each en∣deavoured to shew his parts by the brilliancy of his conversation, that the ambassador might have something to relate of the Grecian wisdom. One of them, offended, no doubt, at the lo∣quacity of his companions, observed a profound silence; when the ambassa∣dor, turning to him, asked, <Q>But what have you to say, that I may report it?</Q> He made this laconic, but very pointed reply: <Q>Tell your king, that you have found one among the Greeks who knew how to be silent.</Q></P>
<P>THERE is a quality infinitely more intoxicating to the female mind than knowledge—this is Wit, the most cap∣tivating, but the most dreaded of all talents: the most dangerous to those
<PB N="44" REF="49"/>who have it, and the most feared by those who have it not. Though it is against all the rules, yet I cannot find in my heart to abuse this charming quality. He who is grown rich with∣out it, in safe and sober dulness, shuns it as a disease, and looks upon poverty as its invariable concomitant. The moralist declaims against it as the source of irregularity, and the frugal citizen dreads it more than bankruptcy itself, for he considers it as the parent of extravagance and beggary. The Cynic will ask of what use it is? Of very little perhaps: no more is a flower garden, and yet it is allowed as an object of innocent amusement and delightful recreation. A woman, who possesses this quality, has received a most dangerous present, perhaps not less so than beauty itself: especially it it be not sheathed in a temper peculi∣arly
<PB N="45" REF="50"/>inoffensive, chastised by a most correct judgment, and restrained by more prudence than falls to the com∣mon lot.</P>
<P>THIS talent is more likely to make a woman vain than knowledge; for as Wit is the immediate property of its possessor, and learning is only an ac∣quaintance with the knowledge of other people, there is much more danger, that we should be vain of what is our own, than of what we borrow.</P>
<P>BUT Wit, like learning, is not near so common a thing as is imagined. Let not therefore a young lady be alarmed at the acuteness of her own wit, any more than at the abundance of her own knowledge. The great danger is, lest she should mistake pert∣ness, flippancy, or imprudence, for this
<PB N="46" REF="51"/>brilliant quality, or imagine she is witty, only because she is indiscreet. This is very frequently the case, and this makes the name of wit so cheap, while its real existence is so rare.</P>
<P>LEST the flattery of her acquaint∣ance, or an over-weening opinion of her own qualifications, should lead some vain and petulant girl into a false notion that she has a great deal of wit, when she has only a redundancy of animal spirits, she may not find it use∣less to attend to the definition of this quality, by one who had as large a portion of it, as most individuals could ever boast:
<Q><L>'Tis not a tale, 'tis not a jest,</L>
<L>Admir'd with laughter at a feast,</L>
<L>Nor florid talk, which can that title gain,</L>
<L>The prooss of wit for ever must remain.</L>
<L><PB N="47" REF="52"/>
Neither can that have any place,</L>
<L>At which a virgin hides her face;</L>
<L>Such dross the fire must purge away; 'tis just,</L>
<L>The author blush there, where the reader must.</L>
<BIBL>COWLEY.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>BUT those who actually possess this rare talent, cannot be too abstinent in the use of it. It often makes admirers, but it never makes friends; I mean, where it is the predominant feature; and the unprotected and defenceless state of womanhood calls for friend∣ship more than for admiration. She who does not desire friends has a sor∣did and insensible soul; but she who is ambitious of making every man her admirer, has an invincible vanity and a cold heart.</P>
<P>BUT to dwell only on the side of policy, a prudent woman, who has established the reputation of some ge∣nius,
<PB N="48" REF="53"/>will sufficiently maintain it, with∣out keeping her faculties always on the stretch to say <HI>good things.</HI> Nay, if reputation alone be her object, she will gain a more solid one by her for∣bearance, as the wiser part of her ac∣quaintance will ascribe it to the right motive, which is, not that she has less wit, but that she has more judgment.</P>
<P>THE fatal fondness for indulging a spirit of ridicule, and the injurious and irreparable consequences which some∣times attend the <HI>too prompt reply,</HI> can never be too seriously or too severely condemned. Not to offend, is the first step towards pleasing. To give pain is as much an offence against huma∣nity, as against good breeding; and surely it is as well to abstain from an action because it is sinful, as because it is unpolite. In company, young
<PB N="49" REF="54"/>ladies would do well before they speak, to reflect, if what they are going to say may not distress some worthy per∣son present, by wounding them in their persons, families, connexions, or religious opinions. If they find it will touch them in either of these, I should advise them to suspect, that what they were going to say is not so <HI>very</HI> good a thing as they at first imagined. Nay, if even it was one of those bright ideas, which <HI>Venus has im∣bued with a fifth part of her nectar,</HI> so much greater will be their merit in suppressing it, if there was a probabi∣lity it might offend. Indeed, if they have the temper and prudence to make such a previous reflection, they will be more richly rewarded by their own in∣ward triumph, at having suppressed a lively but severe remark, than they could have been with the dissembled
<PB N="50" REF="55"/>applauses of the whole company, who, with that complaisant deceit, which good breeding too much authorises, affect openly to admire what they se∣cretly resolve never to forgive.</P>
<P>I HAVE always been delighted with the story of the little girl's eloquence, in one of the Children's Tales, who re∣ceived from a friendly fairy the gift, that at every word she uttered, pinks, roses, diamonds, and pearls, should drop from her mouth. The hidden moral appears to be this, that is was the sweetness of her temper which pro∣duced this pretty fanciful effect: for when her malicious sister desired the same gift from the good natured tiny Intelligence, the venom of her own heart converted it into poisonous and loathsome reptiles.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="56"/>A MAN of sense and breeding will sometimes join in the laugh, which has been raised at his expence by an ill∣natured repartee; but if it was very cutting, and one of those shocking sort of truths, which as they can scarcely be pardoned even in private, ought never to be uttered in public, he does not laugh because he is pleased, but because he wishes to conceal how much he is hurt. As the sarcasm was uttered by a lady, so far from seeming to re∣sent it, he will be the first to commend it; but notwithstanding that, he will remember it as a trait of malice, when the whole company shall have forgot∣ten it as a stroke of wit. Women are so far from being privileged by their sex to say unhandsome or cruel things, that it is this very circumstance which renders them more intolerable. When the arrow is lodged in the heart, it is
<PB N="52" REF="57"/>no relief to him who is wounded to reflect, that the hand which shot it was a fair one.</P>
<P>MANY women, when they have a favourite point to gain, or an earnest wish to bring any one over to their opi∣nion, often use a very disingenuous method: they will state a case ambi∣guously, and then avail themselves of it, in whatever manner shall best answer their purpose; leaving your mind in a state of indecision as to their real meaning, while they triumph in the perplexity they have given you by the unfair conclusions they draw, from pre∣mises equivocally stated. They will also frequently argue from exceptions instead of rules, and are astonished when you are not willing to be con∣tented with a prejudice, instead of a reason.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="58"/>IN a sensible company of both sexes, where women are not restrained by any other reserve than what their natu∣ral modesty imposes; and where the intimacy of all parties authorises the utmost freedom of communication; should any one inquire what were the general sentiments on some particular subject, it will, I believe, commonly happen, that the ladies, whose imagi∣nations have kept pace with the narra∣tion, have anticipated its end, and are ready to deliver their sentiments on it as soon as it is finished. While some of the male hearers, whose minds were busied in settling the propriety, com∣paring the circumstances, and examin∣ing the consistencies of what was said, are obliged to pause and discriminate, before they think of answering No∣thing is so embarrassing as a variety of matter, and the conversation of women
<PB N="54" REF="59"/>is often more perspicuous, because it is less laboured.</P>
<P>A MAN of deep reflection, if he does not keep up an intimate commerce with the world, will be sometimes so entangled in the intricacies of intense thought, that he will have the appear∣ance of a confused and perplexed ex∣pression; while a sprightly woman will extricate herself with that lively and "rash dexterity," which will almost always please, though it is very far from being always right. It is easier to confound than to convince an oppo∣nent; the former may be effected by a turn that has more happiness than truth in it. Many an excellent rea∣soner, well skilled in the theory of the schools, has felt himself discomfited by a reply, which, though as wide of the mark, and as foreign to the ques∣tion
<PB N="55" REF="60"/>as can be conceived, has discon∣certed him more than the most start∣ling proposition, or the most accurate chain of reasoning could have done; and he has borne the laugh of his fair antagonist, as well as of the whole company, though he could not but feel, that his own argument was at∣tended with the fullest demonstration: so true is it, that it is not always neces∣sary to be right, in order to be ap∣plauded.</P>
<P>BUT let not a young lady's vanity be too much elated with this false ap∣plause, which is given, not to her merit, but to her sex: she has not per∣haps gained a victory, though she may be allowed a triumph; and it should humble her to reflect, that the tribute is paid, not to her strength but her weakness. It is worth while to discri|
<PB N="56" REF="61"/>minate between that applause, which is given from the complaisance of others, and that which is paid to our own merit.</P>
<P>WHERE great sprightliness is the na∣tural bent of the temper, girls should endeavour to habituate themselves to a custom of observing, thinking, and reasoning. I do not mean, that they should devote themselves to abstruse speculation, or the study of logic; but she who is accustomed to give a due arrangement to her thoughts, to rea∣son justly and pertinently on common affairs, and judiciously to deduce ef∣fects from their causes, will be a better logician than some of those who claim the name, because they have studied the art: this is being <Q>learned with∣out the rules;</Q> the best definition, perhaps, of that sort of literature which
<PB N="57" REF="62"/>is properest for the sex. That species of knowledge, which appears to be the result of reflection rather than of sci∣ence, sits peculiarly well on women. It is not uncommon to find a lady, who, though she does not know a rule of Syntax, scarcely ever violates one; and who constructs every sentence she utters, with more propriety than many a learned dunce, who has every rule of Aristotle by heart, and who can lace his own thread-bare discourse with the golden shreds of Cicero and Virgil.</P>
<P>IT has been objected, and I fear with some reason, that female con∣versation is too frequently tinctured with a censorious spirit, and that ladies are seldom apt to discover much ten∣derness for the errors of a fallen sister.
<Q><PB N="58" REF="63"/>If it be so, it is a grievous fault.</Q>
No arguments can justify, no pleas can extenuate it. To insult over the mi∣series of an unhappy creature is inhu∣man, not to compassionate them is un∣christian. The worthy part of the sex always express themselves humanely on the failings of others, in propor∣tion to their own undeviating good∣ness.</P>
<P>AND here I cannot help remarking, that young women do not always care∣fully distinguish between running into the error of detraction, and its oppo∣site extreme of indiscriminate applause. This proceeds from the false idea they entertain, that the direct contrary to what is wrong must be right. Thus the dread of being only suspected of one fault makes them actually guilty of another. The desire of avoiding
<PB N="59" REF="64"/>the imputation of envy, impels them to be insincere; and to establish a reputation for sweetness of temper and generosity, they affect sometimes to speak of very indifferent characters with the most extravagant applause. With such, the hyperbole is a favou∣rite figure; and every degree of com∣parison but the superlative is rejected, as cold and inexpressive. But this habit of exaggeration greatly weakens their credit, and destroys the weight of their opinion on other occasions; for people very soon discover what de∣gree of faith is to be given both to their judgment and veracity. And those of real merit will no more be flattered by that approbation, which cannot distinguish the value of what it praises, than the celebrated painter must have been at the judgment passed
<PB N="60" REF="65"/>on his works by an ignorant spectator, who, being asked what he thought of such and such very capital but very different pieces, cried out in an affect∣ed rapture, "All alike! all alike!"</P>
<P>IT has been proposed to the young, as a maxim of supreme wisdom, to manage so dexterously in conversation, as to appear to be well acquainted with subjects, of which they are to∣tally ignorant; and this, by affecting silence in regard to those, on which they are known to excel.—But why counsel this disingenuous fraud? Why add to the numberless arts of deceit, this practice of deceiving, as it were, on a settled principle? If to disavow the knowledge they really have be a culpable affectation, then certainly to insinuate an idea of their skill, where
<PB N="61" REF="66"/>they are actually ignorant, is a most unworthy artifice.</P>
<P>BUT of all the qualifications for conversation, humility, if not the most brilliant, is the safest, the most amiable, and the most feminine. The affectation of introducing subjects, with which others are unacquainted, and of displaying talents superior to the rest of the company, is as dange∣rous as it is foolish.</P>
<P>THERE are many, who never can forgive another for being more agree∣able and more accomplished than themselves, and who can pardon any offence rather than an eclipsing me∣rit. Had the nightingale in the fa∣ble conquered his vanity, and resisted the temptation of shewing a fine voice,
<PB N="62" REF="67"/>he might have escaped the talons of the hawk. The melody of his singing was the cause of his destruction; his merit brought him into danger, and his vanity cost him his life.</P>

<BIBL>FLETCHER'S PURPLE ISLAND.</BIBL>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>"ENVY, (says Lord Bacon) has no holidays." There cannot perhaps be a more lively and striking description of the miserable state of mind those endure, who are tormented
<PB N="64" REF="69"/>with this vice. A spirit of emulation has been supposed to be the source of the greatest improvements; and there is no doubt but the warmest rivalship will produce the most excellent effects; but it is to be feared, that a perpetual state of contest will injure the temper so essentially, that the mischief will hardly be counterbalanced by any other advantages. Those, whose pro∣gress is the most rapid, will be apt to despise their less successful competi∣tors, who, in return, will feel the bit∣terest resentment against their more fortunate rivals. Among persons of real goodness, this jealousy and con∣tempt can never be equally felt, be∣cause every advancement in piety will be attended with a proportionable in∣crease of humility, which will lead them to contemplate their own improve∣ments
<PB N="65" REF="70"/>with modesty, and to view with charity the miscarriages of others.</P>
<P>WHEN an envious man is melan∣choly, one may ask him, in the words of Bion, what evil has befallen him∣self, or what good has happened to another? This last is the scale by which he principally measures his feli∣city, and the very smiles of his friends are so many deductions from his own happiness. The wants of others are the standard by which he rates his own wealth, and he estimates his riches, not so much by his own possessions, as by the necessities of his neigh∣bours.</P>
<P>WHEN the malevolent intend to strike a very deep and dangerous stroke of malice, they generally begin the most remotely in the world from
<PB N="66" REF="71"/>the subject nearest their hearts. They set out with commending the object of their envy for some trifling quality or advantage, which it is scarcely worth while to possess: they next proceed to make a general profession of their own good-will and regard for him: thus artfully removing any suspicion of their design, and clearing all obstruc∣tions for the insidious stab they are about to give; for who will suspect them of an intention to injure the ob∣ject of their peculiar and professed esteem? The hearer's belief of the fact grows in proportion to the seem∣ing reluctance with which it is told, and to the conviction he has, that the relater is not influenced by any private pique, or personal resentment; but that the confession is extorted from him sorely against his inclination, and purely on account of his zeal for truth.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="72"/>ANGER is less reasonable and more sincere than envy.—Anger breaks out abruptly; envy is a great prefacer— anger wishes to be understood at once: envy is fond of remote hints and am∣biguities; but, obscure as its oracles are, it never ceases to deliver them till they are perfectly comprehended:— anger repeats the same circumstances over again; envy invents new ones at every fresh recital—anger gives a broken, vehement, and interrupted narrative; envy tells a more consistent and more probable, though a falser tale—anger is excessively imprudent, for it is impatient to disclose every thing it knows; envy is discreet, for it has a great deal to hide—anger ne∣ver consults times or seasons; envy waits for the lucky moment, when the wound it meditates may be made the most exquisitely painful, and the
<PB N="68" REF="73"/>most incurably deep—anger uses more invective; envy does more mischief— simple anger soons runs itself out of breath, and is exhausted at the end of its tale; but it is for that chosen pe∣riod that envy has treasured up the most barbed arrow in its whole quiver— anger puts a man out of himself: but the truly malicious generally preserve the appearance of self-possession, or they could not so effectually injure.— The angry man sets out by destroying his whole credit with you at once, for he very frankly confesses his abhor∣rence and detestation of the object of his abuse; while the envious man care∣fully suppresses all his own share in the affair.—The angry man defeats the end of his resentment, by keeping <HI>him∣self</HI> continually before your eyes, in∣stead of his enemy; while the envious man artfully brings forward the object
<PB N="69" REF="74"/>of his malice, and keeps himself out of sight.—The angry man talks loudly of his own wrongs; the envious of his adversary's injustice.—A passionate per∣son, if his resentments are not compli∣cated with malice, divides his time between sinning and sorrowing; and, as the irascible passions cannot constant∣ly be at work, his heart may some∣times get a holiday.—Anger is a violent act, envy a constant habit—no one can be always angry, but he may be al∣ways envious:—an angry man's enmity (if he be generous) will subside when the object of his resentment becomes unfortunate; but the envious man can extract food from his malice out of ca∣lamity itself, if he finds his adversary bears it with dignity, or is pitied or assisted in it. The rage of the pas∣sionate man is totally extinguished by the death of his enemy; but the ha∣tred
<PB N="70" REF="75"/>of the malicious is not buried even in the grave of his rival: he will envy the good name he has left behind him; he will envy him the tears of his wi∣dow, the prosperity of his children, the esteem of his friends, the praises of his epitaph—nay the very magnifi∣cence of his funeral.</P>
<P>"THE ear of jealousy heareth all things," (says the wise man) frequently I believe more than is uttered, which makes the company of persons in∣fected with it still more dangerous.</P>
<P>WHEN you tell those of a malicious turn, any circumstance that has hap∣pened to another, though they per∣fectly know of whom you are speak∣ing, they often affect to be at a loss, to forget his name, or to misapprehend you in some respect or other; and this
<PB N="71" REF="76"/>merely to have an opportunity of slily gratifying their malice by mentioning some unhappy defect or personal infir∣mity he labours under; and not con∣tented "to tack his every error to his name," they will, by way of farther explanation, have recourse to the faults of his father, or the misfortunes of his family; and this with all the seem∣ing simplicity and candor in the world, merely for the sake of preventing mis∣takes, and to clear up every doubt of his identity.—If you are speaking of a lady, for instance, they will perhaps embellish their inquiries, by asking if you mean her, whose great grandfather was a bankrupt, though she has the vanity to keep a chariot, while others who are much better born walk on foot; or they will afterwards recollect, that you may possibly mean her cousin, of the same name, whose mother was
<PB N="72" REF="77"/>suspected of such or such an indiscre∣tion, though the daughter had the luck to make her fortune by marrying, while her betters are overlooked.</P>
<P>To <HI>hint at a fault,</HI> does more mis∣chief than speaking out; for whatever is left for the imagination to finish, will not fail to be overdone: every hiatus will be more then filled up, and every pause more than supplied. There is less malice, and less mischief too, in telling a man's name than the ini∣tials of it; as a worthier person may be involved in the most disgraceful suspicions by such a dangerous ambi∣guity.</P>
<P>IT is not uncommon for the envi∣ous, after having attempted to deface the fairest character so industriously, that they are afraid you will begin to
<PB N="73" REF="78"/>detect their malice, to endeavour to remove your suspicions effectually, by assuring you, that what they have just related is only the popular opinion; they themselves can never believe things are so bad as they are said to be; for their part, it is a rule with them always to hope the best. It is their way never to believe or report ill of any one. They will, however, mention the story in all companies, that they may do their friend the ser∣vice of protesting their disbelief of it. More reputations are thus hinted away by false friends, than are openly de∣stroyed by public enemies. An <HI>if,</HI> or a <HI>but,</HI> or a mortified look, or a lan∣guid defence, or an ambiguous shake of the head, or a hasty word affectedly recalled, will demolish a character more effectually, than the whole artillery of malice when openly levelled against it.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="79"/>IT is not that envy never praises— No, that would be making a public profession of itself, and advertising its own malignity; whereas the greatest success of its efforts depends on the concealment of their end. When envy intends to strike a stroke of Machiave∣lian policy, it sometimes affects the language of the most exaggerated ap∣plause; though it generally takes care, that the subject of its panegyric shall be a very indifferent and common cha∣racter, so that it is well aware none of its praises will stick.</P>
<P>IT is the unhappy nature of envy not to be contented with positive mi∣sery, but to be continually aggra∣vating its own torments, by compar∣ing them with the felicities of others. The eyes of envy are perpetually fixed on the object which disturbs it, nor
<PB N="75" REF="80"/>can it avert them from it, though to procure itself the relief of a tempo∣rary forgetfulness. On seeing the in∣nocence of the first pair,
<Q><L>Aside the devil turn'd,</L>
<L>For Envy, yet with jealous leer malign,</L>
<L>Eyed them askance.</L></Q></P>
<P>As this enormous sin chiefly insti∣gated the revolt, and brought on the ruin of the angelic spirits, so it is not improbable, that it will be a principal instrument of misery in a future world, for the envious to compare their des∣perate condition with the happiness of the children of God; and to heighten their actual wretchedness by reflecting on what they have lost.</P>
<P>PERHAPS envy, like lying and in∣gratitude, is practised with more fre∣quency, because it is practised with
<PB N="76" REF="81"/>impunity; but there being no human laws against these crimes, is so far from an inducement to commit them, that this very consideration would be suf∣ficient to deter the wise and good, if all others were ineffectual; for of how heinous a nature must those sins be, which are judged above the reach of human punishment, and are reserved for the final justice of God himself!</P>

<HEAD>ON THE DANGER OF SENTIMENTAL OR ROMANTIC CONNEXIONS.</HEAD>
<P>AMONG the many evils which prevail under the sun, the abuse of words is not the least considerable. By the influence of time, and the per∣version of fashion, the plainest and most unequivocal may be so altered,
<PB N="78" REF="83"/>as to have a meaning assigned them al∣most diametrically opposite to their original signification.</P>
<P>THE present age may be termed, by way of distinction, the age of senti∣timent, a word which, in the impli∣cation it now bears, was unknown to our plain ancestors. Sentiment is the varnish of virtue to conceal the defor∣mity of vice; and it is not uncommon for the same persons to make a jest of religion, to break through the most solemn ties and engagements, to prac∣tise every art of latent fraud and open seduction, and yet to value themselves on speaking and writing <HI>sentimentally.</HI></P>
<P>BUT this refined jargon, which has infested letters and tainted morals, is chiefly admired and adopted by <HI>young ladies</HI> of a certain turn, who read <HI>sen∣timental
<PB N="79" REF="84"/>books,</HI> write <HI>sentimental letters,</HI> and contract <HI>sentimental friendships.</HI></P>
<P>ERROR is never likely to do so much mischief as when it disguifes its real tendency, and puts on an engag∣ing and attractive appearance. Many a young woman, who would be shock∣ed at the imputation of an intrigue, is extremely flattered at the idea of a sentimental connexion, though perhaps with a dangerous and designing man, who, by putting on this mask of plau∣sibility and virtue, disarms her of her prudence, lays her apprehensions asleep, and involves her in misery; misery the more inevitable because unsuspect∣ed. For she who apprehends no dan∣ger, will not think it necessary to be always upon her guard; but will ra∣ther invite than avoid the ruin which
<PB N="80" REF="85"/>comes under so specious and so fair a form.</P>
<P>SUCH an engagement will be infi∣nitely dearer to her vanity than an avowed and authorised attachment; for one of these sentimental lovers will not scruple very seriously to assure a cre∣dulous girl, that her unparalleled me∣rit entitles her to the adoration of the whole world, and that the universal homage of mankind is nothing more than the unavoidable tribute extorted by her charms. No wonder then she should be easily prevailed on to be∣lieve, that an individual is captivated by perfections which might enslave a million. But she should remember, that he who endeavours to intoxicate her with adulation, intends one day most effectually to humble her. For an artful man has always a secret de∣sign
<PB N="81" REF="86"/>to pay himself in future for every present sacrifice. And this prodigality of praise, which he now appears to lavish with such thoughtless profusion, is, in fact, a sum oeconomically laid out to supply his future necessities: of this sum he keeps an exact estimate, and at some distant day promises him∣self the most exorbitant interest for it. If he has address and conduct, and the object of his pursuit much vanity, and some sensibility, he seldom fails of success; for so powerful will be his ascendancy over her mind, that she will soon adopt his notions and opini∣ons. Indeed, it is more than probable she possessed most of them before, hav∣ing gradually acquired them in her initiation into the sentimental charac∣ter. To maintain that character with dignity and propriety, it is necessary she should entertain the most elevated
<PB N="82" REF="87"/>ideas of disproportionate alliances, and disinterested love; and consider for∣tune, rank, and reputation, as mere chimerical distinctions and vulgar pre∣judices.</P>
<P>THE lover, deeply versed in all the obliquities of fraud, and skilled to wind himself into every avenue of the heart which indiscretion has left unguarded, soon discovers on which side it is most accessible. He avails himself of this weakness by addressing her in a lan∣guage exactly consonant to her own ideas. He attacks her with her own weapons, and opposes rhapsody to sentiment.—He professes so sovereign a contempt for the paltry concerns of money, that she thinks it her duty to reward him for so generous a renun∣ciation. Every plea he artfully ad∣vances of his own unworthiness, is
<PB N="83" REF="88"/>considered by her as a fresh demand which her gratitude must answer. And she makes it a point of honour to sa∣crifice to him that fortune which he is too noble to regard. These profes∣sions of humility are the common ar∣tifice of the vain, and these protesta∣tions of generosity the refuge of the rapacious. And among its many smooth mischiefs, it is one of the sure and successful frauds of sentiment, to affect the most frigid indifference to those external and pecuniary advan∣tages, which it is its great and real object to obtain.</P>
<P>A SENTIMENTAL girl very rarely entertains any doubt of her personal beauty; for she has been daily accus∣tomed to contemplate it herself, and to hear of it from others. She will not, therefore, be very solicitous for
<PB N="84" REF="89"/>the confirmation of a truth so self-evident; but she suspects, that her pretensions to understanding are more likely to be disputed, and, for that reason, greedily devours every com∣pliment offered to those perfections, which are less obvious and more re∣fined. She is persuaded, that men need only open their eyes to decide on her beauty, while it will be the most convincing proof of the taste, sense, and elegance of her admirer, that he can discern and flatter those qualities in her. A man of the cha∣racter here supposed, will easily in∣sinuate himself into her affections, by means of this latent but leading foible, which may be called the guiding clue to a sentimental heart. He will affect to overlook that beauty which attracts common eyes, and ensnares common hearts, while he will bestow the most
<PB N="85" REF="90"/>delicate praises on the beauties of her mind, and finish the climax of adu∣lation, by hinting that she is superior to it.</P>
<L>And when he tells her she hates flattery,</L>
<L>She says she does, being then most flatter'd.</L>
<P>BUT nothing, in general, can end less delightfully than these sublime attach∣ments, even where no acts of seduc∣tion were ever practised, but they are suffered, like mere sublunary connexi∣ons, to terminate in the vulgar cata∣strophe of marriage. That wealth, which lately seemed to be looked on with ineffable contempt by the lover, now appears to be the principal at∣traction in the eyes of the husband; and he, who but a few short weeks before, in a transport of sentimental generosity, wished her to have been a village maid, with no portion but
<PB N="86" REF="91"/>her crook and her beauty, and that they might spend their days in pastoral love and innocence, has now lost all relish for the Arcadian life, or any other life in which she must be his companion.</P>
<P>ON the other hand, she who was lately
<Q>An angel call'd, and angel-like ador'd,</Q>
is shocked to find herself at once strip∣ped of all her celestial attributes. This late divinity, who scarcely yielded to her sisters of the sky, now finds her∣self of less importance in the esteem of the man she has chosen, than any other mere mortal woman. No longer is she gratified with the tear of coun∣terfeited passion, the sigh of dissembled rapture, or the language of premedi∣tated adoration. No longer is the
<PB N="87" REF="92"/>altar of her vanity loaded with the ob∣lations of fictitious fondness, the in∣cense of falsehood, or the sacrifice of flattery.—Her apotheosis is ended!— She feels herself degraded from the dignities and privileges of a goddess, to all the imperfections, vanities, and weaknesses of a slighted woman, and a neglected wife. Her faults, which were so lately overlooked, or mistaken for virtues, are now, as Cassius says, set in a note-book. The passion, which was vowed eternal, lasted only a few short weeks; and the indiffe∣rence, which was so far from being included in the bargain, that it was not so much as suspected, follows them through the whole tiresome journey of their insipid, vacant, joyless existence.</P>
<P>THUS much for the <HI>completion</HI> of the sentimental history. If we trace it
<PB N="88" REF="93"/>back to its beginning, we shall sind that a damsel of this cast had her head originally turned by pernicious read∣ing, and her insanity confirmed by imprudent friendships. She never fails to select a beloved <HI>confidante</HI> of her own turn and humour, though, if she can help it, not quite so handsome as herself. A violent intimacy ensues, or, to speak the language of sentiment, an intimate union of souls immediately takes place, which is wrought to the highest pitch by a secret and volumi∣nous correspondence, though they live in the same street, or perhaps in the same house. This is the fuel which principally feeds and supplies the dan∣gerous flame of sentiment. In this correspondence the two friends encou∣rage each other in the falsest notions imaginable. They represent romantic love as the great important business
<PB N="89" REF="94"/>of human life, and describe all the other concerns of it as too low and paltry to merit the attention of such elevated beings, and fit only to em∣ploy the daughters of the plodding vulgar. In these letters, family affairs are misrepresented, family secrets di∣vulged, and family misfortunes ag∣gravated. They are filled with vows of eternal amity, and protestations of never-ending love. But interjections and quotations are the principal em∣bellishments of these very sublime epistles. Every panegyric contained in them is extravagant and hyperbo∣lical, and every censure exaggerated and excessive. In a favourite, every frailty is heightened into a perfection, and in a foe degraded into a crime. The dramatic poets, especially the most tender and romantic, are quoted in almost every line, and every pom∣pous
<PB N="90" REF="95"/>or pathetic thought is forced to give up its natural and obvious mean∣ing, and with all the violence of mis∣application, is compelled to suit some circumstance of imaginary woe of the fair transcriber. Alicia is not too mad for her heroics, nor Monimia too mild for her soft emotions.</P>
<P>FATHERS <HI>have flinty hearts</HI> is an ex∣pression worth an empire, and is al∣ways used with peculiar emphasis and enthusiasm. For a favourite topic of these epistles is the groveling spirit and sordid temper of the parents, who will be sure to find no quarter at the hands of their daughters, should they presume to be so unreasonable as to direct their course of reading, interfere in their choice of friends, or interrupt their very important correspondence. But as these young ladies are fertile in But as these young ladies are fertile in
<PB N="91" REF="96"/>expedients, and as their genius is ne∣ver more agreeably exercised than in finding resources, they are not with∣out their secret exultation, in case ei∣ther of the above interesting events should happen, as they carry with them a certain air of tyranny and per∣secution which is very delightful. For a prohibited correspondence is one of the great incidents of a sentimental life, and a letter clandestinely received, the supreme felicity of a sentimental lady.</P>
<P>NOTHING can equal the astonishment of these soaring spirits, when their plain friends or prudent relations pre∣sume to remonstrate with them on any impropriety in their conduct. But if these worthy people happen to be somewhat advanced in life, their con∣tempt is then a little softened by pity, at the reflection that such very anti∣quated
<PB N="92" REF="97"/>poor creatures should pretend to judge what is fit or unfit for ladies of their great refinement, sense, and reading. They consider them as wretches utterly ignorant of the sublime plea∣sures of a delicate and exalted passion; as tyrants whose authority is to be con∣temned, and as spies whose vigilance is to be eluded. The prudence of these worthy friends they term suspicion, and their experience dotage. For they are persuaded, that the face of things has so totally changed since their pa∣rents were young, that though they might then judge tolerably for them∣selves, yet they are now (with all their advantages of knowledge and observation) by no means qualified to direct their more enlightened daugh∣ters; who, if they have made a great progress in the sentimental walk, will
<PB N="93" REF="98"/>no more be influenced by the advice of their mother, than they would go abroad in her laced pinner or her bro∣cade suit.</P>
<P>BUT young people never shew their folly and ignorance more conspicu∣ously, than by this over-confidence in their own judgment, and this haughty disdain of the opinion of those who have known more days. Youth has a quickness of apprehension, which it is very apt to mistake for an acuteness of penetration. But youth, like cun∣ning, though very conceited, is very short-sighted, and never more so than when it disregards the instructions of the wise, and the admonitions of the aged. The same vices and follies in∣fluenced the human heart in their day, which influence it now, and
<PB N="94" REF="99"/>nearly in the same manner. One who well knew the world and its various vanities, has said, <Q>The thing which hath been, it is that which shall be, and that which is done is that which shall be done, and there is no new thing under the sun.</Q></P>
<P>IT is also a part of the sentimental character, to imagine that none but the young and the beautiful have any right to the pleasures of society, or even to the common benefits and bless∣ings of life. Ladies of this turn also affect the most lofty disregard for use∣ful qualities and domestic virtues; and this is a natural consequence: for as this sort of sentiment is only a weed of idleness, she who is constantly and usefully employed, has neither leisure nor propensity to cultivate it.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="100"/>A SENTIMENTAL lady principally values herself on the enlargement of her notions, and her liberal way of thinking. This superiority of soul chiefly manifests itself in the contempt of those minute delicacies and little de∣corums, which, trifling as they may be thought, tend at once to dignify the character, and to restrain the levity of the younger part of the sex.</P>
<P>PERHAPS the error here complained of, originates in mistaking <HI>sentiment</HI> and <HI>principle</HI> for each other. Now I conceive them to be extremely diffe∣rent. Sentiment is the virtue of <HI>ideas,</HI> and principle the virtue of <HI>action.</HI> Sen∣timent has its seat in the head, prin∣ciple in the heart. Sentiment suggests fine harangues and subtile distinctions; principle conceives just notions, and performs good actions in consequence
<PB N="96" REF="101"/>of them. Sentiment refines away the simplicity of truth and the plainness of piety; and, as a celebrated wit <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Voltaire's Prophecy concerning Rousseau.</NOTE> has remarked of his no less celebrated contemporary, gives us virtue in words and vice in deeds. Sentiment may be called the Athenian, who <HI>knew</HI> what was right, and principle the Lacede∣monian who <HI>practised</HI> it.</P>
<P>BUT these qualities will be better exemplified by an attentive consider∣ation of two admirably drawn cha∣racters of Milton, which are beauti∣fully, delicately, and distinctly mark∣ed. These are, Belial, who may not improperly be called the <HI>Demon of Sen∣timent;</HI> and Abdiel, who may be termed the <HI>Angel of Principle.</HI></P>

It will also be ob∣served, that the contrast between them is kept up throughout, with the ut∣most exactness of delineation, and the most animated strength of colouring.

<Q><L>Nor was it ought but just,</L>

<L>Victor.</L></Q>
<P>BUT notwithstanding I have spoken with some asperity against sentiment as opposed to principle, yet I am con∣vinced,
<PB N="101" REF="106"/>that true genuine sentiment, (not the sort I have been describing) may be so connected with principle, as to bestow on it its brightest lustre, and its most captivating graces. And enthusiasm is so far from being disa∣greeable, that a portion of it is per∣haps indispensably necessary in an en∣gaging woman. But it must be the enthusiasm of the heart, not of the senses. It must be the enthusiasm which grows up with a feeling mind, and is cherished by a virtuous education; not that which is compounded of irregular passions, and artificially refined by books of unna∣tural fiction and improbable adven∣ture. I will even go so far as to assert, that a young woman cannot have any real greatness of soul, or true elevation of principle, if she has not a tincture of what the vulgar would call Ro∣mance, but which persons of a certain
<PB N="102" REF="107"/>way of thinking will discern to pro∣ceed from those fine feelings, and that charming sensibility, without which, though a woman may be worthy, yet she can never be amiable.</P>
<P>BUT this dangerous merit cannot be too rigidly watched, as it is very apt to lead those who possess it into incon∣veniencies from which less interesting characters are happily exempt. Young women of strong sensibility may be carried by the very amiableness of this temper into the most alarming ex∣tremes. Their tastes are passions. They love and hate with all their hearts, and scarcely suffer themselves to feel a rea∣sonable preference before it strengthens into a violent attachment.</P>
<P>WHEN an innocent girl of this open, trusting, tender heart, happens to meet
<PB N="103" REF="108"/>with one of her own sex and age, whose address and manners are engag∣ing, she is instantly seized with an ar∣dent desire to commence a friendship with her. She feels the most lively impatience at the restraints of compa∣ny, and the decorums of ceremony. She longs to be alone with her, longs to assure her of the warmth of her ten∣derness, and generously ascribes to the fair stranger all the good qualities she feels in her own heart, or rather all those which she has met with in her reading, dispersed in a variety of hero∣ines. She is persuaded, that her new friend unites them all in herself, be∣cause she carries in her prepossessing countenance the promise of them all. How cruel and how censorious would this inexperienced girl think her mo∣ther was, who should venture to hint, that the agreeable unknown had de∣fects
<PB N="104" REF="109"/>in her temper, or exceptions in her character. She would mistake these hints of discretion for the insinuations of an uncharitable disposition. At first she would perhaps listen to them with a generous impatience, and afterwards with a cold and silent disdain. She would despise them as the effect of prejudice, misrepresentation, or igno∣rance. The more aggravated the cen∣sure, the more vehemently would she protest in secret, that her friendship for this dear injured creature (who is raised much higher in her esteem by such injurious suspicions) shall know no bounds, as she is assured it can know no end.</P>
<P>YET this trusting considence, this honest indiscretion, is, at this early pe∣riod of life as amiable as it is natural; and will, if wisely cultivated, produce,
<PB N="105" REF="110"/>at its proper season, fruits infinitely more valuable than all the guarded circumspection of premature, and therefore artificial, prudence. Men, I believe, are seldom struck with these sudden prepossessions in favour of each other. They are not so unsuspecting, nor so easily led away by the predomi∣nance of fancy. They engage more warily, and pass through the several stages of acquaintance, intimacy, and confidence, by slower gradations; but women, if they are sometimes deceived in the choice of a friend, enjoy even then an higher degree of satisfaction than if they never trusted. For to be always clad in the burthensome ar∣mour of suspicion is more painful and inconvenient, than to run the hazard of suffering now and then a transient injury.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="111"/>BUT the above observations only extend to the young and the inexpe∣rienced; for I am very certain, that women are capable of as faithful and as durable friendship as any of the other sex. They can enter not only into all the enthusiastic tenderness, but into all the solid fidelity of attach∣ment. And if we cannot oppose in∣stances of equal weight with those of Nysus and Euryalus, Theseus and Pi∣rithous, Pylades and Orestes, let it be remembered, that it is because the re∣corders of those characters were men, and that the very existence of them is merely poetical.</P>

<HEAD>ON TRUE AND FALSE MEEKNESS.</HEAD>
<P>A LOW voice and soft address are the common indications of a well-bred woman, and should seem to be the natural effects of a meek and quiet spirit; but they are only the outward and visible signs of it: for
<PB N="108" REF="113"/>they are no more meekness itself, than a red coat is courage, or a black one devotion.</P>
<P>YET nothing is more common than to mistake the sign for the thing itself; nor is any practice more frequent than that of endeavouring to acquire the exterior mark, without once thinking to labour after the interior grace. Surely this is beginning at the wrong end, like attacking the symptom and neg∣lecting the disease. To regulate the features, while the soul is in tumults, or to command the voice while the passions are without restraint, is as idle as throwing odours into a stream when the source is polluted.</P>
<P>THE <HI>sapient king,</HI> who knew better than any man the nature and the power of beauty, has assured us, that the
<PB N="109" REF="114"/>temper of the mind has a strong influ∣ence upon the features: <Q>Wisdom maketh the face to shine,</Q> says that exquisite judge; and surely no part of wisdom is more likely to produce this amiable effect, than a placid sere∣nity of soul.</P>
<P>IT will not be difficult to distinguish the true from the artificial meekness. The former is universal and habitual, the latter, local and temporary. Every young female may keep this rule by her, to enable her to form a just judg∣ment of her own temper: if she is not as gentle to her chambermaid as she is to her visitor, she may rest satisfied that the spirit of gentleness is not in her.</P>
<P>WHO would not be shocked and disappointed to behold a well-bred
<PB N="110" REF="115"/>young lady, soft and engaging as the doves of Venus, displaying a thousand graces and attractions to win the hearts of a large company, and the instant they are gone, to see her look mad as the Py∣thian maid, and all the frightened graces driven from her furious countenance, only because her gown was brought home a quarter of an hour later than she expected, or her ribbon sent half a shade lighter or darker than she or∣dered?</P>
<P>ALL men's characters are said to proceed from their servants; and this is more particularly true of ladies: for as their situations are more domestic, they lie more open to the inspection of their families, to whom their real characters are easily and perfectly known; for they seldom think it worth while to practise any disguise before
<PB N="111" REF="116"/>those, whose good opinion they do not value, and who are obliged to submit to their most insupportable humours, because they are paid for it.</P>
<P>AMONGST women of breeding, the exterior of gentleness is so uniformly assumed, and the whole manner is so perfectly level and <HI>uni,</HI> that it is next to impossible for a stranger to know any thing of their true disposi∣tions by conversing with them, and even the very features are so exactly regulated, that physiognomy, which may sometimes be trusted among the vulgar, is, with the polite, a most lying science.</P>
<P>A VERY termagant woman, if she happens also to be a very artful one, will be conscious she has so much to conceal, that the dread of betraying
<PB N="112" REF="117"/>her real temper will make her put on an over-acted softness, which, from its very excess, may be distinguished from the natural, by a penetrating eye. That gentleness is ever liable to be suspected for the counterfeited, which is so ex∣cessive as to deprive people of the pro∣per use of speech and motion, or which, as Hamlet says, makes them lisp and amble, and nick-name God's creatures.</P>
<P>THE countenance and manners of some very fashionable persons may be compared to the inscriptions on their monuments, which speak nothing but good of what is within; but he who knows any thing of the world, or of the human heart, will no more trust to the courtesy, than he will depend on the epitaph.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="118"/>AMONG the various artifices of fac∣titious meekness, one of the most fre∣quent and most plausible, is that of affecting to be always equally delighted with all persons and all characters. The society of these languid beings is with∣out confidence, their friendship with∣out attachment, and their love without affection, or even preference. This insipid mode of conduct may be safe, but I cannot think it has either taste, sense, or principle in it.</P>
<P>THESE uniformly smiling and ap∣proving ladies, who have neither the noble courage to reprehend vice, nor the generous warmth to bear their ho∣nest testimony in the cause of virtue, conclude every one to be ill-natured who has any penetration, and look up∣on a distinguishing judgment as want of tenderness. But they should learn,
<PB N="114" REF="119"/>that this discernment does not always proceed from an uncharitable temper, but from that long experience and thorough knowledge of the world, which lead those who have it to scru∣tinize into the conduct and disposition of men, before they trust entirely to those fair appearances, which some∣times veil the most insidious purposes.</P>
<P>WE are perpetually mistaking the qualities and dispositions of our own hearts. We elevate our failings into virtues, and qualify our vices into weaknesses: and hence arise so many false judgments respecting meekness. Self-ignorance is at the root of all this mischief. Many ladies complain that, for their part, their spirit is so meek they can bear nothing; whereas, if they spoke truth, they would say, their spirit is so high and unbroken that
<PB N="115" REF="120"/>they can bear nothing. Strange! to plead their meekness as a reason why they cannot endure to be crossed, and to produce their impatience of contra∣diction as a proof of their gentleness!</P>
<P>MEEKNESS, like most other virtues, has certain limits, which it no sooner exceeds than it becomes criminal. Ser∣vility of spirit is not gentleness but weakness, and if allowed, under the specious appearances it sometimes puts on, will lead to the most dangerous compliances. She who hears inno∣cence maligned without vindicating it, falsehood asserted without contradict∣ing it, or religion prophaned without resenting it, is not gentle but wicked.</P>
<P>To give up the cause of an innocent, injured friend, if the popular cry hap∣pens to be against him, is the most
<PB N="116" REF="121"/>disgraceful weakness. This was the case of Madame de Maintenon. She loved the character and admired the talents of Racine; she caressed him while he had no enemies, but wanted the greatness of mind, or rather the common justice, to protect him against the greatness of mind, or rather the common justice, to protect him against their resentment when he had; and her favourite was abandoned to the suspicious jealousy of the king, when a prudent remonstrance might have preserved him.—But her tameness, if not absolute connivance in the great massacre of the protestants, in whose church she had been bred, is a far more guilty instance of her weakness; an instance which, in spite of all her devotional zeal and incomparable pru∣dence, will disqualify her from shining in the annals of good women, how∣ever she may be entitled to figure among the great and the fortunate.
<PB N="117" REF="122"/>Compare her conduct with that of her undaunted and pious countryman and contemporary, Bougi, who, when Louis would have prevailed on him to renounce his religion for a commis∣sion or a government, nobly replied, <Q>If I could be persuaded to betray my God for a marshal's staff, I might betray my king for a bribe of much less consequence.</Q></P>
<P>MEEKNESS is imperfect, if it be not both active and passive; if it will not enable us to subdue our own passions and resentments, as well as qualify us to bear patiently the passions and re∣sentments of others.</P>
<P>BEFORE we give way to any violent emotion of anger, it would perhaps be worth while to consider the value of the object which excites it, and to re∣flect
<PB N="118" REF="123"/>for a moment, whether the thing we so ardently desire, or so vehemently resent, be really of as much import∣ance to us, as that delightful tran∣quillity of soul, which we renounce in pursuit of it. If, on a fair calculation, we find we are not likely to get as much as we are sure to lose, then, putting all religious considerations out of the question, common sense and human policy will tell us, we have made a foolish and unprofitable ex∣change. Inward quiet is a part of one's self; the object of our resentment may be only a matter of opinion; and, certainly, what makes a portion of our actual happiness ought to be too dear to us, to be sacrificed for a tri∣fling, foreign, perhaps imaginary good.</P>
<P>THE most pointed satire I remember to have read, on a mind enslaved by
<PB N="119" REF="124"/>anger, is an observation of Seneca's. <Q>Alexander (said he) had two friends, Clitus and Lysimachus; the one he exposed to a lion, the other to him∣self: he who was turned loose to the beast escaped, but Clitus was mur∣dered, for he was turned loose to an angry man.</Q></P>
<P>A PASSIONATE woman's happiness is never in her own keeping: it is the sport of accident, and the slave of events. It is in the power of her ac∣quaintance, her servants, but chiefly of her enemies, and all her comforts lie at the mercy of others. So far from being willing to learn of him who was meek and lowly, she considers meekness as the want of a becoming spirit, and lowliness as a despicable and vulgar meanness. And an impe∣rious woman will so little covet the
<PB N="120" REF="125"/>ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, that it is almost the only ornament she will not be solicitous to wear. But re∣sentment is a very expensive vice. How dearly has it cost its votaries, even from the sin of Cain, the first offender in this kind! <Q>It is cheaper (says a pious writer) to forgive, and save the charges.</Q></P>
<P>IF it were only for mere human rea∣sons, it would turn to a better account to be patient; nothing defeats the ma∣lice of an enemy like a spirit of for∣bearance; the return of rage for rage cannot be so effectually provoking. True gentleness, like an impenetrable armour, repels the most pointed shafts of malice: they cannot pierce through this invulnerable shield, but either fall hurtless to the ground, or return to wound the hand that shot them.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="126"/>A MEEK spirit will not look out of it∣self for happiness, because it finds a constant banquet at home; yet, by a sort of divine alchymy, it will convert all external events to its own profit, and be able to deduce some good, even from the most unpromising: it will ex∣tract comfort and satisfaction from the most barren circumstances: <Q>It will suck honey out of the rock, and oil out of the flinty rock.</Q></P>
<P>BUT the supreme excellence of this complacent quality is, that it naturally disposes the mind where it resides, to the practice of every other that is ami∣able.

<P><PB N="122" REF="127"/>THE peculiar importance and value of this amiable virtue may be farther seen in its permanency.

<HEAD>THOUGHTS ON THE CULTIVATION OF THE HEART AND TEMPER IN THE EDUCATION OF DAUGHTERS.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE not the foolish presump∣tion to imagine, that I can offer any thing new on a subject, which has been so successfully treated by many learned and able writers. I would only, with all possible deference, beg
<PB N="124" REF="129"/>leave to hazard a few short remarks on that part of the subject of educa∣tion, which I would call the <HI>education of the heart.</HI> I am well aware, that this part also has not been less skil∣fully and forcibly discussed than the rest, though I cannot, at the same time, help remarking, that it does not appear to have been so much adopted into common practice.</P>
<P>IT appears then, that notwithstand∣ing the great and real improvements, which have been made in the affair of female education, and notwithstand∣ing the more enlarged and generous views of it, which prevail in the pre∣sent day, that there is still a very ma∣terial defect, which it is not, in general, enough the object of attention to re∣move. This defect seems to consist in this, that too little regard is paid
<PB N="125" REF="130"/>to the dispositions of the <HI>mind,</HI> that the indications of the <HI>temper</HI> are not properly cherished, nor the affections of the <HI>heart</HI> sufficiently regulated.</P>
<P>IN the first education of girls, as far as the customs which fashion esta∣blishes are right, they should undoubr∣edly be followed. Let the exterior be made a considerable object of attention, but let it not be the principal, let it not be the only one.—Let the graces be industriously cultivated, but let them not be cultivated at the expence of the virtues.—Let the arms, the head, the whole person be carefully polished, but let not the heart be the only portion of the human anatomy, which shall be totally overlooked.</P>
<P>THE neglect of this cultivation seems to proceed as much from a bad taste,
<PB N="126" REF="131"/>as from a false principle. The gene∣rality of people form their judgment of education by slight and sudden ap∣pearances, which is certainly a wrong way of determining. Music, dancing, and languages, gratify those who teach them, by perceptible and almost imme∣diate effects; and when there happens to be no imbecillity in the pupil, nor deficiency in the master, every super∣ficial observer can, in some measure, judge of the progress.—The effects of most of these accomplishments address themselves to the senses; and there are more who can see and hear, than there are who can judge and reflect.</P>
<P>PERSONAL perfection is not only more obvious, it is also more rapid; and even in very accomplished charac∣ters, elegance usually precedes prin∣ciple.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="132"/>BUT the heart, that natural seat of evil propensities, that little trouble∣some empire of the passions, is led to what is right by slow motions and im∣perceptible degrees. It must be ad∣monished by reproof, and allured by kindness. Its liveliest advances are frequently impeded by the obstinacy of prejudice, and its brightest pro∣mises often obscured by the tempests of passion. It is slow in its acquisition of virtue, and reluctant in its ap∣proaches to piety.</P>
<P>THERE is another reason, which proves this mental cultivation to be more important, as well as more diffi∣cult, than any other part of education. In the usual fashionable accomplish∣ments, the business of acquiring them is almost always getting forwards, and one difficulty is conquered before an∣other
<PB N="128" REF="133"/>other is suffered to shew itself; for a prudent teacher will level the road his pupil is to pass, and smooth the in∣equalities which might retard her pro∣gress.</P>
<P>BUT in morals, (which should be the great object constantly kept in view) the task is far more difficult. The unruly and turbulent desires of the heart are not so obedient; one pas∣sion will start up before another is sup∣pressed. The subduing Hercules can∣not cut off the heads so often as the prolific Hydra can produce them, nor fell the stubborn Antaeus so fast as he can recruit his strength, and rise in vigorous and repeated opposition.</P>
<P>IF all the accomplishments could be bought at the price of a single virtue, the purchase would be infinitely dear!
<PB N="129" REF="134"/>And, however startling it may sound, I think it is, notwithstanding, true, that the labours of a good and wise mother, who is anxious for her daugh∣ter's most important interests, will <HI>seem</HI> to be at variance with those of her in∣structors. She will doubtless rejoice at her progress in any polite art, but she will rejoice with trembling:—hu∣mility and piety form the solid and durable basis, on which she wishes to raise the superstructure of the accom∣plishments, while the accomplishments themselves are frequently of that un∣steady nature, that if the foundation is not secured, in proportion as the building is enlarged, it will be over∣loaded and destroyed by those very ornaments, which were intended to embellish, what they have contributed to ruin.</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="135"/>THE more ostensible qualifications should be carefully regulated, or they will be in danger of putting to flight the modest train of retreating virtues, which cannot safely subsist before the bold eye of public observation, or bear the bolder tongue of impudent and audacious flattery. A tender mo∣ther cannot but feel an honest triumph, in contemplating those excellencies in her daughter which deserve applause, but she will also shudder at the vanity which that applause may excite, and at those hitherto unknown ideas which it may awaken.</P>
<P>THE master, it is his interest, and perhaps his duty, will naturally teach a girl to set her improvements in the most conspicuous point of light. SE FAIRE VALOIR is the great principle industriously inculcated into her young
<PB N="131" REF="136"/>heart, and seems to be considered as a kind of fundamental maxim in edu∣cation. It is however the certain and effectual seed, from which a thousand yet unborn vanities will spring. This dangerous doctrine (which yet is not without its uses) will be counteracted by the prudent mother, not in so many words, but by a watchful and scarcely perceptible dexterity. Such an one will be more careful to have the talents of her daughter <HI>cultivated</HI> than <HI>exhibited.</HI></P>
<P>ONE would be led to imagine, by the common mode of female edu∣cation, that life consisted of one uni∣versal holiday, and that the only con∣test was, who should be best enabled to excel in the sports and games that were to be celebrated on it. Merely ornamental accomplishments will but
<PB N="132" REF="137"/>indifferently qualify a woman to per∣form the <HI>duties</HI> of life, though it is highly proper she should possess them, in order to furnish the <HI>amusements</HI> of it. But is it right to spend so large a portion of life without some prepa∣ration for the business of living? A lady may speak a little French and Italian, repeat a few passages in a the∣atrical tone, play and sing, have her dressing-room hung with her own draw∣ings, and her person covered with her own tambour work, and may, not∣withstanding, have been very <HI>badly educated.</HI> Yet I am far from attempt∣ing to depreciate the value of these qualifications: they are most of them not only highly becoming, but often indispensably necessary, and a polite education cannot be perfected with∣out them. But as the world seems to be very well apprised of their import∣ance,
<PB N="133" REF="138"/>there is the less occasion to in∣sist on their utility. Yet, though well∣bred young women should learn to dance, sing, recite and draw, the end of a good education is not that they may become dancers, singers, players or painters: its real object is to make them good daughters, good wives, good mistresses, good members of so∣ciety, and good christians. The above qualifications therefore are intended to <HI>adorn</HI> their <HI>leisure,</HI> not to <HI>employ</HI> their <HI>lives;</HI> for an amiable and wise woman will always have something better to value herself on, than these advan∣tages, which, however captivating, are still but subordinate parts of a truly excellent character.</P>
<P>BUT I am afraid parents themselves sometimes contribute to the error of which I am complaining. Do they
<PB N="134" REF="139"/>not often set a higher value on those acquisitions which are calculated to attract observation, and catch the eye of the multitude, than on those which are valuable, permanent, and internal? Are they not sometimes more solici∣tous about the opinion of others, re∣specting their children, than about the real advantage and happiness of the children themselves? To an inju∣dicious and superficial eye, the best educated girl may make the least bril∣liant figure, as she will probably have less flippancy in her manner, and less repartee in her expression; and her ac∣quirements, to borrow bishop Sprat's idea, will be rather <HI>enamelled than em∣bossed.</HI> But her merit will be known, and acknowledged by all who come near enough to discern, and have taste enough to distinguish. It will be un∣derstood and admired by the man,
<PB N="135" REF="140"/>whose happiness she is one day to make, whose family she is to govern, and whose children she is to educate. He will not seek for her in the haunts of dissipation, for he knows he shall not find her there; but he will seek for her in the bosom of retirement, in the practice of every domestic virtue, in the exertion of every amiable ac∣complishment, exerted in the shade, to enliven retirement, to heighten the endearing pleasures of social inter∣course, and to embellish the narrow but charming circle of family delights. To this amiable purpose, a truly good and well educated young lady will de∣dicate her more elegant accomplish∣ments, instead of exhibiting them to at∣tract admiration, or depress inferiority.</P>
<P>YOUNG girls, who have more viva∣city than understanding, will often
<PB N="136" REF="141"/>make a sprightly figure in conversation. But this agreeable talent for entertain∣ing others, is frequently dangerous to themselves, nor is it by any means to be desired or encouraged very early in life. This immaturity of wit is helped on by frivolous reading, which will produce its effect in much less time than books of solid instruction; for the imagination is touched sooner than the understanding; and effects are more rapid as they are more pernicious. Conversation should be the <HI>result</HI> of education, not the <HI>precursor</HI> of it. It is a golden fruit, when suffered to grow gradually on the tree of know∣ledge; but if precipitated by forced and unnatural means, it will in the end become vapid, in proportion as it is artificial.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="142"/>THE best effects of a careful and religious education are often very re∣mote: they are to be discovered in future scenes, and exhibited in untried connexions. Every event of life will be putting the heart into fresh situ∣ations, and making demands on its prudence, its firmness, its integrity, or its piety. Those whose business it is to form it, can foresee none of these situations; yet, as far as human wis∣dom will allow, they must enable it to provide for them all, with an hum∣ble dependence on the divine assistance. A well-disciplined soldier must learn and practise all his evolutions, though he does not know on what service his leader may command him, by what foe he shall be attacked, not what mode of combat the enemy may use.</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="143"/>ONE great art of education consists in not suffering the feelings to become too acute by unnecessary awakening, nor too obtuse by the want of exertion. The former renders them the source of calamity, and totally ruins the tem∣per; while the latter blunts and de∣bases them, and produces a dull, cold, and selfish spirit. For the mind is an instrument, which, if wound too high, will lose its sweetness, and if not enough strained, will abate of its vi∣gour.</P>
<P>How cruel is it to extinguish by neglect or unkindness, the precious sensibility of an open temper, to chill the amiable glow of an ingenous soul, and to quench the bright flame of a noble and generous spirit! These are of higher worth than all the documents of learning, of dearer price than all
<PB N="139" REF="144"/>the advantages, which can be derived from the most refined and artificial mode of education.</P>
<P>BUT sensibility and delicacy, and an ingenous temper, make no part of education, exclaims the pedagogue— they are reducible to no class—they come under no article of instruction— they belong neither to languages nor to music.—What an error! They <HI>are</HI> a part of education, and of infinitely more value,
<Q>Than all their pedant discipline e'er knew.</Q>
It is true, they are ranged under no class, but they are superior to all; they are of more esteem than languages or music, for they are the language of the heart, and the music of the accord∣ing passions. Yet this sensibility is, in many instances, so far from being
<PB N="140" REF="145"/>cultivated, that it is not uncommon to see those who affect more than usual sagacity, cast a smile of supercilious pity, at any indication of a warm, generous, or enthusiastic temper in the lively and the young; as much as to say, <Q>they will know better, and will have more discretion when they are older.</Q> But every appearance of amiable simplicity, or of honest shame, <HI>Nature's hasty conscience,</HI> will be dear to sensible hearts; they will carefully cherish every such indication in a young female; for they will perceive that it is this temper, wisely culti∣vated, which will one day make her enamoured of the loveliness of virtue, and the beauty of holiness: from which she will acquire a taste for the doctrines of religion, and a spirit to perform the duties of it. And those who wish to make her ashamed of
<PB N="141" REF="146"/>this charming temper, and seek to dis∣possess her of it, will, it is to be feared, give her nothing better in exchange. But whoever reflects at all, will easily discern how carefully this enthusiasm is to be directed, and how judiciously its redundances are to be lopped away.</P>
<P>PRUDENCE is not natural to chil∣dren; they can, however, substitute art in its stead. But is it not much better that a girl should discover the faults incident to her age, than con∣ceal them under this dark and impe∣netrable veil? I could almost venture to assert, that there is something more becoming in the very errors of nature, where they are undisguised, than in the affectation of virtue itself, where the reality is wanting. And I am so far from being an admirer of prodigies,
<PB N="142" REF="147"/>that I am extremely apt to suspect them; and am always infinitely better pleased with Nature in her more com∣mon modes of operation. The precise and premature wisdom, which some girls have cunning enough to assume, is of a more dangerous tendency than any of their natural failings can be, as it effectually covers those secret bad dispositions, which, if they displayed themselves, might be rectified. The hypocrisy of assuming virtues which are not inherent in the heart, prevents the growth and disclosure of those real ones, which it is the great end of edu∣cation to cultivate.</P>
<P>BUT if the natural indications of the temper are to be suppressed and stifled, where are the diagnostics, by which the state of the mind is to be known? The wise Author of all things, who
<PB N="143" REF="148"/>did nothing in vain, doubtless intend∣ed them as symptoms, by which to judge of the diseases of the heart; and it is impossible diseases should be cured before they are known. If the stream be so cut off as to prevent com∣munication, or so choked up as to defeat discovery, how shall we ever reach the source, out of which are the issues of life?</P>
<P>THIS cunning, which, of all the different dispositions girls discover, is most to be dreaded, is increased by nothing so much as by fear. If those about them express violent and unrea∣sonable anger at every trivial offence, it will always promote this temper, and will very frequently create it, where there was a natural tendency to frankness. The indiscreet transports of rage, which many betray on every
<PB N="144" REF="149"/>slight occasion, and the little distinc∣tion they make between venial errors and premeditated crimes, naturally dispose a child to conceal, what she does not however care to suppress. Anger in one will not remedy the faults of another; for how can an instrument of sin cure sin? If a girl is kept in a state of perpetual and slavish terror, she will perhaps have artifice enough to conceal those propensities which she knows are wrong, or those actions which she thinks are most abnoxious to punishment. But, nevertheless, she will not cease to indulge those propen∣sities, and to commit those actions, when she can do it with impunity.</P>
<P>GOOD <HI>dispositions,</HI> of themselves, will go but a very little way, unless they are confirmed into good <HI>principles.</HI> And this cannot be effected but by a
<PB N="145" REF="150"/>careful course of religious instruction, and a patient and laborious cultivation of the moral temper.</P>
<P>BUT, notwithstanding girls should not be treated with unkindness, nor the first openings of the passions blight∣ed by cold severity; yet I am of opi∣nion, that young females should be accustomed very early in life to a cer∣tain degree of restraint. The natural cast of character, and the moral dis∣tinctions between the sexes, should not be disregarded, even in childhood. That bold, independent, enterprising spirit, which is so much admired in boys, should not, when it happens to discover itself in the other sex, be en∣couraged, but suppressed. Girls should be taught to give up their opinions betimes, and not pertinaciously to car∣ry on a dispute, even if they should
<PB N="146" REF="151"/>know themselves to be in the right. I do not mean, that they should be robbed of the liberty of private judg∣ment, but that they should by no means be encouraged to contract a contentious or contradictory turn. It is of the greatest importance to their future happiness, that they should ac∣quire a submissive temper, and a for∣bearing spirit: for it is a lesson which the world will not fail to make them frequently practise, when they come abroad into it, and they will not prac∣tise it the worse for having learnt it the sooner. These early restraints, in the limitation here meant, are so far from being an effect of cruelty, that they are the most indubitable marks of affection, and are the more meritorious, as they are severe trials of tenderness. But all the beneficial effects, which a mother can expect from this watch∣fulness,
<PB N="147" REF="152"/>will be entirely defeated, if it is practised occasionally, and not habitually, and if it ever appears to be used to gratify caprice, ill-humour, or resentment.</P>
<P>THOSE who have children to edu∣cate ought to be extremely patient: it is indeed a labour of love. They should reflect, that extraordinary ta∣lents are neither essential to the well∣being of society, nor to the happiness of individuals. If that had been the case, the beneficent Father of the uni∣verse would not have made them so rare. For it is as easy for an Almighty Creator to produce a Newton, as an ordinary man; and he could have made those powers common which we now consider as wonderful, without any miraculous exertion of his omnipo∣tence, if the existence of many New∣tons
<PB N="148" REF="153"/>had been necessary to the perfec∣tion of his wise and gracious plan.</P>
<P>SURELY, therefore, there is more piety, as well as more sense, in labour∣ing to improve the talents which chil∣dren actually have, than in lamenting that they do not possess supernatural endowments or angelic perfections. A passage of Lord Bacon's furnishes an admirable incitement for endeavouring to carry the amiable and christian grace of charity to its farthest extent, instead of indulging an over-anxious care for more brilliant but less impor∣tant acquisitions. <Q>The desire of power in excess (says he) caused the angels to fall; the desire of know∣ledge in excess caused man to fall; but in charity is no excess, neither can men nor angels come into dan∣ger by it.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="154"/>A GIRL who has docility will seldom be found to want understanding enough for all the purposes of a social, a hap∣py, and an useful life. And when we behold the tender hope of fond and anxious love, blasted by disap∣pointment, the defect will as often be discovered to proceed from the neglect or the error of cultivation, as from the natural temper; and those who lament the evil, will sometimes be found to have occasioned it.</P>
<P>IT is as injudicious for parents to set out with too sanguine a dependence on the merit of their children, as it is for them to be discouraged at every repulse. When their wishes are de∣feated in this or that particular in∣stance, where they had treasured up some darling expectation, this is so far from being a reason for relaxing their
<PB N="150" REF="155"/>attention, that it ought to be an ad∣ditional motive for redoubling it. Those who hope to do a great deal, must not expect to do every thing. If they know any thing of the malignity of sin, the blindness of prejudice, or the corruption of the human heart, they will also know, that that heart will al∣ways remain, after the very best possible education, full of infirmity and imperfec∣tion. Extraordinary allowances, there∣fore, must be made for the weakness of nature in this its weakest state. After much is done, much will remain to do, and much, very much, will still be left undone. For this regulation of the passions and affections cannot be the work of education alone, with∣out the concurrence of divine grace operating on the heart. Why then should parents repine, if their efforts are not always crowned with imme∣diate
<PB N="151" REF="156"/>success? They should consider, that they are not educating cherubims and seraphims, but men and women; creatures, who at their best estate are al∣together vanity: how little then can be expected from them in the weakness and imbecillity of infancy! I have dwelt on this part of the subject the longer, because I am certain that many, who have set out with a warm and active zeal, have cooled on the very first discouragement, and have afterwards almost totally remitted their vigilance, through a criminal kind of despair.</P>
<P>GREAT allowances must be made for a profusion of gaiety, loquacity, and even indiscretion in children, that there may be animation enough left to supply an active and useful character, when the first fermentation of the youthful passions is over, and the re∣dundant
<PB N="152" REF="157"/>spirits shall come to sub∣side.</P>
<P>IF it be true, as a consummate judge of human nature has observed,
<Q>That not a vanity is given in vain,</Q>
it is also true, that there is scarcely a single passion, which may not be turned to some good account, if prudently rectified, and skilfully turned into the road of some neighbouring virtue. It cannot be violently bent, or unnatu∣rally forced towards an object of a totally opposite nature, but may be gradually inclined towards a correspon∣dent but superior affection. Anger, hatred, resentment, and ambition, the most restless and turbulent passions which shake and distract the human soul, may be led to become the most active opposers of sin, after having
<PB N="153" REF="158"/>been its most successful instruments. Our anger, for instance, which can never be totally subdued, may be made to turn against ourselves, for our weak and imperfect obedience—our hatred, against every species of vice—our am∣bition, which will not be discarded, may be ennobled: it will not change its name, but its object: it will de∣spise what it lately valued, nor be contented to grasp at less than immor∣tality.</P>
<P>THUS the joys, fears, hopes, desires, all the passions and affections, which separate in various currents from the soul, will, if directed into their pro∣per channels, after having fertilised wherever they have flowed, return again to swell and enrich the parent source.</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="159"/>THAT the very passions which appear the most uncontroulable and unpro∣mising, may be intended, in the great scheme of Providence, to answer some important purpose, is remarkably evi∣denced in the character and history of Saint Paul. A remark on this sub∣ject by an ingenious old Spanish wri∣ter, which I will here take the liberty to translate, will better illustrate my meaning.</P>
<P><Q>To convert the bitterest enemy into the most zealous advocate, is the work of God for the instruction of man. Plutarch has observed, that the medical science would be brought to the utmost perfection, when poison should be converted into physic. Thus, in the mortal disease of Judaism and idolatry,
<PB N="155" REF="160"/>our blessed Lord converted the ad∣der's venom of Saul the persecutor, into that cement which made Paul the chosen vessel. That manly ac∣tivity, that restless ardor, that burning zeal for the law of his fathers, that ardent thirst for the blood of Christians, did the Son of God find necessary in the man who was one day to become the defender of his suffering people.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Obras de Quevedo, vida de San Pablo Apostol.</NOTE></P>
<P>To win the passions, therefore, over to the cause of virtue, answers a much nobler end than their extinction would possibly do, even if that could be ef∣fected. But it is their nature never to observe a neutrality; they are ei∣ther rebels or auxiliaries, and an enemy subdued is an ally obtained.
<PB N="156" REF="161"/>If I may be allowed to change the al∣lusion so soon, I would say, that the passions also resemble fires, which are friendly and beneficial when under pro∣per direction, but if suffered to blaze without restraint, they carry devastation along with them, and, if totally ex∣tinguished, leave the benighted mind in a state of cold and comfortless in∣anity.</P>
<P>BUT in speaking of the usefulness of the passions, as instruments of vir∣tue, <HI>envy</HI> and <HI>lying</HI> must always be excepted: these, I am persuaded, must either go on in still progressive mis∣chief, or else be radically cured, be∣fore any good can be expected from the heart which has been infected with them. For I never will believe that envy, though passed through all the moral strainers, can be refined into a
<PB N="157" REF="162"/>virtuous emulation, or lying improved into an agreeable turn for innocent in∣vention. Almost all the other pas∣sions may be made to take an amiable hue; but these two must either be to∣tally extirpated, or be always content∣ed to preserve their original deformity, and to wear their native black.</P>

<HEAD>ON THE IMPORTANCE OF RELIGION TO THE FEMALE CHARACTER.</HEAD>
<P>VARIOUS are the reasons why the greater part of mankind can∣not apply themselves to arts or letters. Particular studies are only suited to the capacities of particular persons. Some are incapable of applying to
<PB N="159" REF="164"/>them from the delicacy of their sex, some from the unsteadiness of youth, and others from the imbecillity of age. Many are precluded by the narrow∣ness of their education, and many by the straitness of their fortune. The wisdom of God is wonderfully mani∣fested in this happy and well-ordered diversity, in the powers and proper∣ties of his creatures; since by thus ad∣mirably suiting the agent to the action, the whole scheme of human affairs is carried on with the most agreeing and consistent oeconomy, and no chasm is left for want of an object to fill it, ex∣actly suited to its nature.</P>
<P>BUT in the great and universal con∣cern of religion, both sexes, and all ranks, are equally interested. The truly catholic spirit of christianity ac∣commodates itself, with an astonish∣ing
<PB N="160" REF="165"/>condescension, to the circumstances of the whole human race. It rejects none on account of their pecuniary wants, their personal infirmities, or their intellectual deficiencies. No su∣periority of parts is the least recom∣mendation, nor is any depression of fortune the smallest objection. None are too wise to be excused from per∣forming the duties of religion, nor are any too poor to be excluded from the consolations of its promises.</P>
<P>IF we admire the wisdom of God, in having furnished different degrees of intelligence, so exactly adapted to their different destinations, and in having fitted every part of his stupendous work, not only to serve its own immediate purpose, but also to contribute to the beauty and perfection of the whole: how much more ought we to adore
<PB N="161" REF="166"/>that goodness, which has perfected the divine plan, by appointing one wide, comprehensive, and universal means of salvation: a salvation, which all are invited to partake; by a means which all are capable of using; which nothing but voluntary blindness can prevent our comprehending, and no∣thing but wilful error can hinder us from embracing.</P>
<P>THE Muses are coy, and will only be wooed and won by some highly-favoured suitors. The Sciences are lofty, and will not stoop to the reach of ordinary capacities. But <Q>Wis∣dom (by which the royal preacher means piety) is a loving spirit: she is easily seen of them that love her, and found of all such as seek her.</Q> Nay, she is so accessible and conde∣scending, <Q>that she preventeth them
<PB N="162" REF="167"/>that desire her, making herself first known unto them.</Q></P>
<P>WE are told by the same animated writer, <Q>that Wisdom is the breath of the power of God.</Q> How infi∣nitely superior, in grandeur and subli∣mity, is this description to the origin of the <HI>wisdom</HI> of the heathens, as de∣scribed by their poets and mythologists! In the exalted strains of the Hebrew poetry we read, that <Q>Wisdom is the brightness of the everlasting light, the unspotted mirror of the power of God, and the image of his good∣ness.</Q></P>
<P>THE philosophical author of <HI>The Defence of Learning</HI> observes, that knowledge has something of venom and malignity in it, when taken with∣out its proper corrective, and what
<PB N="163" REF="168"/>that is, the inspired Saint Paul teaches us, by placing it as the immediate an∣tidote: <HI>Knowledge puffeth up, but cha∣rity edifieth.</HI> Perhaps, it is the vanity of human wisdom, unchastised by this correcting principle, which has made so many infidels. It may proceed from the arrogance of a self-sufficient pride, that some philosophers disdain to ac∣knowledge their belief in a being, who has judged proper to conceal from them the infinite wisdom of his coun∣sels; who, (to borrow the lofty lan∣guage of the man of Uz) refused to consult them when he laid the foun∣dations of the earth, when he shut up the sea with doors, and made the clouds the garment thereof.</P>
<P>A MAN must be an infidel either from pride, prejudice, or bad educa∣tion: he cannot be one unawares or
<PB N="164" REF="169"/>by surprise; for infidelity is not occa∣sioned by sudden impulse or violent temptation. He may be hurried by some vehement desire into an immoral action, at which he will blush in his cooler moments, and which he will lament as the sad effect of a spirit un∣subdued by religion; but infidelity is a calm, considerate act, which cannot plead the weakness of the heart, or the seduction of the senses. Even good men frequently fail in their duty through the infirmities of nature, and the allurements of the world; but the infidel errs on a plan, on a settled and deliberate principle.</P>
<P>But though the minds of men are sometimes fatally infected with this disease, either through unhappy pre∣possession, or some of the other causes above mentioned; yet I am unwilling
<PB N="165" REF="170"/>to believe, that there is in nature so monstrously incongruous a being, as a <HI>female infidel.</HI> The least reflexion on the temper, the character, and the education of women, makes the mind revolt with horror from an idea so im∣probable, and so unnatural.</P>
<P>MAY I be allowed to observe, that, in general, the minds of girls seem more aptly prepared in their early youth for the reception of serious impressions than those of the other sex, and that their less exposed situations in more advanced life qualify them better for the preservation of them? The daughters (of good parents I mean) are often more carefully in∣structed in their religious duties, than the sons, and this from a variety of causes. They are not so soon sent from under the paternal eye into the
<PB N="166" REF="171"/>bustle of the world, and so early ex∣posed to the contagion of bad exam∣ple: their hearts are naturally more flexible, soft, and liable to any kind of impression the forming hand may stamp on them; and, lastly, as they do not receive the same classical edu∣cation with boys, their feeble minds are not obliged at once to receive and separate the precepts of christianity, and the documents of pagan philoso∣phy. The necessity of doing this per∣haps somewhat weakens the serious impressions of young men, at least till the understanding is formed, and con∣fuses their ideas of piety, by mixing them with so much heterogeneous matter. They only casually read, or hear read, the scriptures of truth, while they are obliged to learn by heart, construe and repeat the poeti∣cal fables of the less than human gods
<PB N="167" REF="172"/>of the ancients. And as the excellent au∣thor of <HI>The Internal Evidence of the Chris∣tian Religion</HI> observes, <Q>Nothing has so much contributed to corrupt the true spirit of the christian institution, as that partiality which we contract, in our earliest education, for the manners of pagan antiquity.</Q></P>
<P>GIRLS, therefore, who do <HI>not</HI> con∣tract this early partiality, ought to have a clearer notion of their religious duties: they are not obliged, at an age when the judgment is so weak, to distinguish between the doctrines of Zeno, of Epicurus, and of Christ; and to embarrass their minds with the various morals which were taught in the <HI>Porch,</HI> in the <HI>Academy,</HI> and on the <HI>Mount.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="173"/>IT is presumed, that these remarks cannot possibly be so misunderstood, as to be construed into the least disre∣spect to literature, or a want of the highest reverence for a learned educa∣tion, the basis of all elegant know∣ledge: they are only intended, with all proper deference, to point out to young women, that however inferior their advantages of acquiring a know∣ledge of the belles-lettres are to those of the other sex; yet it depends on themselves not to be surpassed in this most important of all studies, for which their abilities are equal, and their opportunities, perhaps, greater.</P>
<P>BUT the mere exemption from infi∣delity is so small a part of the religi∣ous character, that I hope no one will attempt to claim any merit from this negative sort of goodness, or va∣lue
<PB N="169" REF="174"/>herself merely for not being the very worst thing she possibly can be. Let no mistaken girl fancy she gives a proof of her wit by her want of piety, or that a contempt of things serious and sacred will exalt her understand∣ing, or raise her character even in the opinion of the most avowed male in∣fidels. For one may venture to affirm, that with all their profligate ideas, both of women and of religion, neither Bolingbroke, Wharton, Buckingham, nor even <HI>Lord Chesterfield himself,</HI> would have esteemed a woman the more for her being irreligious.</P>
<P>WITH whatever ridicule a polite freethinker may affect to treat religion himself, he will think it necessary his wife should entertain different notions of it. He may pretend to despise it as a matter of opinion, depending on
<PB N="170" REF="175"/>creeds and systems; but, if he is a man of sense, he will know the value of it, as a governing principle, which is to influence her conduct and direct her actions. If he sees her unaffect∣edly sincere in the practice of her re∣ligious duties, it will be a secret pledge to him, that she will be equally exact in fulfilling the conjugal; for he can have no reasonable dependance on her attachment to <HI>him,</HI> if he has no opi∣nion of her fidelity to GOD; for she who neglects first duties, gives but an indifferent proof of her disposition to fill up inferior ones; and how can a man of any understanding (whatever his own religious professions may be) trust that woman with the care of his family, and the education of his chil∣dren, who wants herself the best in∣centive to a virtuous life, the belief that she is an accountable creature,
<PB N="171" REF="176"/>and the reflection that she has an im∣mortal soul?</P>
<P>CICERO spoke it as the highest com∣mendation of Cato's character, that he embraced philosophy, not for the sake of <HI>disputing</HI> like a philosopher, but of <HI>living</HI> like one. The chief pur∣pose of christian knowledge is to pro∣mote the great end of a christian life. Every rational woman should, no doubt, be able to give a reason of the hope that is in her; but this know∣ledge is best acquired, and the duties consequent on it best performed, by reading books of plain piety and prac∣tical devotion, and not by entering into the endless feuds, and engaging in the unprofitable contentions of par∣tial controversialists. Nothing is more unamiable than the narrow spirit of party zeal, nor more disgusting than
<PB N="172" REF="177"/>to hear a woman deal out judgments, and denounce vengeance against any one, who happens to differ from her in some opinion, perhaps of no real importance, and which, it is proba∣ble, she may be just as wrong in re∣jecting, as the object of her censure is in embracing. A furious and unmer∣ciful female bigot wanders as far be∣yond the limits prescribed to her sex, as a Thalestris or a Joan d'Arc. Vio∣lent debate has made as few converts as the sword, and both these instru∣ments are particularly unbecoming when wielded by a female hand.</P>
<P>BUT, though no one will be fright∣ened, out of their opinions, yet they may be persuaded out of them: they may be touched by the affecting ear∣nestness of serious conversation, and allured by the attractive beauty of a
<PB N="173" REF="178"/>consistently serious life. And while a young woman ought to dread the name of a wrangling polemic, it is her duty to aspire after the honourable character of a sincere Christian. But this dignified character she can by no means deserve, if she is ever afraid to avow her principles, or ashamed to defend them. A profligate, who makes it a point to ridicule every thing which comes under the appearance of formal instruction, will be disconcerted at the spirited yet modest rebuke of a pious young woman. But there is as much efficacy in the manner of reproving prophaneness, as in the words. If she corrects it with moroseness, she defeats the effect of her remedy, by her un∣skilful manner of administring it. If, on the other hand, she affects to de∣fend the insulted cause of God, in a faint tone of voice, and studied ambi∣guity
<PB N="174" REF="179"/>of phrase, or with an air of le∣vity, and a certain expression of plea∣sure in her eyes, which proves she is secretly delighted with what she pre∣tends to censure, she injures religion much more than he did who publickly prophaned it; for she plainly indicates, either that she does not believe, or respect what she professes. The other attacked it as an open foe; she betrays it as a false friend. No one pays any regard to the opinion of an avowed enemy; but the desertion or treachery of a professed friend, is dangerous in∣deed!</P>
<P>It is a strange notion which prevails in the world, that religion only be∣longs to the old and the melancholy, and that it is not worth while to pay the least attention to it, while we are capable of attending to any thing else.
<PB N="175" REF="180"/>They allow it to be proper enough for the clergy, whose business it is, and for the aged, who have not spirits for any business at all. But till they can prove, that none except the clergy and the aged <HI>die,</HI> it must be confessed, that this is most wretched reasoning.</P>
<P>GREAT injury is done to the inte∣rests of religion, by placing it in a gloomy and unamiable light. It is sometimes spoken of, as if it would actually make a handsome woman ugly, or a young one wrinkled. But can any thing be more absurd than to re∣present the beauty of holiness as the source of deformity?</P>
<P>THERE are few, perhaps, so entirely plunged in business, or absorbed in
<PB N="176" REF="181"/>pleasure, as not to intend, at some future time, to set about a religious life in good earnest. But then they consider it as a kind of <HI>dernier ressort,</HI> and think it prudent to defer flying to this disagreeable refuge, till they have no relish left for any thing else. Do they forget, that to perform this great business well requires all the strength of their youth, and all the vigour of their unimpaired capacities? To con∣firm this assertion, they may observe how much the slightest indisposition, even in the most active season of life, disorders every faculty, and dis∣qualifies them for attending to the most ordinary affairs: and then let them reflect how little able they will be to transact the most important of all business, in the moment of excru∣ciating pain, or in the day of uni∣versal debility.</P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="182"/>WHEN the senses are palled with excessive gratification; when the eye is tired with seeing, and the ear with hearing; when the spirits are so sunk, that the <HI>grasshopper is become a burthen,</HI> how shall the blunted apprehension be capable of understanding a new science, or the worn-out heart be able to relish a new pleasure?</P>
<P>To put off religion till we have lost all taste for amusement; to refuse lis∣tening to the "voice of the charmer," till our enfeebled organs can no longer listen to the voice of <Q>singing men and singing women,</Q> and not to devote our days to heaven till we have "no pleasure in them" ourselves, is but an ungracious offering. And it is a wretched sacrisice to the God of heaven, to present him with the rem∣nants of decayed appetites, and the leavings of extinguished passions.</P>

<HEAD>MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS ON GENIUS, TASTE, GOOD SENSE, <HI>&amp;c.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">THE Author begs leave to offer an apology for introducing this Essay, which, she fears, may be thought foreign to her purpose, But she hopes that her earnest desire of exciting a taste for literature in young ladies, (which encouraged her to hazard the following remarks) will not OBSTRUCT her general design, even if it does not actually PROMOTE it.</NOTE></HEAD>
<P>GOOD <HI>sense</HI> is as different from <HI>genius</HI> as perception is from in∣vention; yet, though distinct qualities,
<PB N="179" REF="184"/>they frequently subsist together. It is altogether opposite to <HI>wit,</HI> but by no means inconsistent with it. It is not science, for there is such a thing as unlettered good sense; yet, though it is neither wit, learning, nor genius, it is a substitute for each, where they do not exist, and the perfection of all where they do.</P>
<P>GOOD sense is so far from deserving the appellation of <HI>common sense,</HI> by which it is frequently called, that it is perhaps one of the rarest qualities of the human mind. If, indeed, this name is given it in respect to its pecu∣liar suitableness to the purposes of common life, there is great propriety
<PB N="180" REF="185"/>in it. Good sense appears to differ from taste in this, that taste is an in∣stantaneous decision of the mind, a sudden relish of what is beautiful, or disgust at what is defective, in an ob∣ject, without waiting for the slower confirmation of the judgment. Good sense is perhaps that confirmation, which establishes a suddenly conceived idea, or feeling, by the powers of comparing and reflecting. They differ also in this, that taste seems to have a more immediate reference to arts, to literature, and to almost every ob∣ject of the senses; while good sense rises to moral excellence, and exerts its influence on life and manners. Taste is fitted to the perception and enjoy∣ment of whatever is beautiful in art or nature: Good sense, to the improve∣ment of the conduct, and the regulation of the heart.</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="186"/>YET the term good sense, is used in∣discriminately to express either a finish∣ed taste for letters, or an invariable prudence in the affairs of life. It is sometimes applied to the most mode∣rate abilities, in which case, the ex∣pression is certainly too strong; and at others to the most shining, when it is as much too weak and inadequate. A sensible man is the usual, but unappro∣priated phrase, for every degree in the scale of understanding, from the sober mortal, who obtains it by his decent demeanor and solid dullness, to him whose talents qualify him to rank with a Bacon, a Harris, or a Johnson.</P>
<P>GENIUS is the power of invention and imitation. It is an incommuni∣cable faculty: no art or skill of the possessor can bestow the smallest por∣tion of it on another: no pains or la∣bour
<PB N="182" REF="187"/>can reach the summit of perfec∣tion, where the seeds of it are want∣ing in the mind; yet it is capable of infinite improvement where it actually exists, and is attended with the highest capacity of communicating instruction, as well as delight to others.</P>
<P>It is the peculiar property of genius to'strike out great or beautiful things: it is the felicity of good sense not to do absurd ones. Genius breaks out in splendid sentiments and elevated ideas; good sense confines its more circum∣scribed, but perhaps more useful walk, within the limits of prudence and pro∣priety.</P>
<Q><L>The poet's eye in a fine frenzy rolling,</L>
<L>Doth glance from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven;</L>
<L>And, as imagination bodies forth</L>
<L>The forms of things unknown, the poet's pen</L>
<L><PB N="183" REF="188"/>
Turns them to shape, and gives to airy nothing</L>
<L>A local habitation and a name.</L></Q>
<P>THIS is perhaps the finest picture of human genius that ever was drawn by a human pencil. It presents a living image of a creative imagination, or a power of inventing things which have no actual existence.</P>
<P>WITH superficial judges, who, it must be confessed, make up the greater part of the mass of mankind, talents are only liked or understood to a cer∣tain degree. Lofty ideas are above the reach of ordinary apprehensions: the vulgar allow those who possess them to be in a somewhat higher state of mind than themselves; but of the vast gulf which separates them, they have not the least conception. They ac∣knowledge a superiority, but of its extent they neither know the value,
<PB N="184" REF="189"/>nor can conceive the reality. It is true, the mind, as well as the eye, can take in objects larger than itself; but this is only true of great minds: for a man of low capacity, who con∣siders a consummate genius, resembles one, who seeing a column for the first time, and standing at too great a dis∣tance to take in the whole of it, con∣cludes it to be flat. Or, like one unacquainted with the first principles of philosophy, who, finding the sen∣sible horizon appear a plain surface, can form no idea of the spherical form of the whole, which he does not see, and laughs at the account of antipodes, which he cannot comprehend.</P>
<P>WHATEVER is excellent is also rare; what is useful is more common. How many thousands are born qualified for the coarse employments of life, for
<PB N="185" REF="190"/>one who is capable of excelling in the fine arts! yet so it ought to be, be∣cause our natural wants are more nu∣merous, and more importunate, than the intellectual.</P>
<P>WHENEVER it happens that a man of distinguished talents has been drawn by mistake, or precipitated by passion, into any dangerous indiscretion; it is common for those whose coldness of temper has supplied the place, and usurped the name of prudence, to boast of their own steadier virtue, and triumph in their own superior caution; only because they have never been as∣sailed by a temptation strong enough to surprise them into error. And with what a visible appropriation of the cha∣racter to themselves, do they constantly conclude, with a cordial compliment to <HI>common sense!</HI> They point out the
<PB N="186" REF="191"/>beauty and usefulness of this quality so forcibly and explicitly, that you cannot possibly mistake whose picture they are drawing with so flattering a pencil. The unhappy man whose con∣duct has been so feelingly arraigned, perhaps acted from good, though mis∣taken motives; at least, from motives of which his censurer has not capacity to judge: but the event was unfavour∣able, nay the action might be really wrong, and the vulgar maliciously take the opportunity of this single indiscre∣tion, to lift themselves nearer on a level with a character, which, except in this instance, has always thrown them at the most disgraceful and mor∣tifying distance.</P>
<P>THE elegant Biographer of Collins, in his affecting apology for that unfor∣tunate genius, remarks, <Q>That the
<PB N="187" REF="192"/>gifts of imagination bring the heaviest task on the vigilance of reason; and to bear those faculties with unerring rectitude, or invariable propriety, requires a degree of firmness, and of cool attention, which does not al∣ways attend the higher gifts of the mind; yet difficult as Nature herself seems to have rendered the task of regularity to genius, it is the su∣preme consolation of dullness, and of folly to point with gothic triumph to those excesses which are the overflowing of faculties they never enjoyed.</Q></P>
<P>WHAT the greater part of the world mean by common sense, will be gene∣rally found, on a closer enquiry, to be art, fraud, or selfishness! That sort of saving prudence which makes men ex∣tremely attentive to their own safety,
<PB N="188" REF="193"/>or profit; diligent in the pursuit of their own pleasures or interests; and perfectly at their ease as to what be∣comes of the rest of mankind. Furies, where their own property is concerned, philosophers when nothing but the good of others is at stake, and per∣fectly resigned under all calamities but their own.</P>
<P>WHEN we see so many accomplished wits of the present age, as remarkable for the decorum of their lives, as for the brilliancy of their writings, we may believe, that, next to principle, it is owing to their <HI>good sense,</HI> which re∣gulates and chastises their imaginations. The vast conceptions which enable a true genius to ascend the sublimest heights, may be so connected with the stronger passions, as to give it a na∣tural tendency to fly off from the strait
<PB N="189" REF="194"/>line of regularity; till good sense, act∣ing on the fancy, makes it gravitate powerfully towards that virtue which is its proper centre.</P>
<P>ADD to this, when it is considered with what imperfection the Divine Wisdom has thought sit to stamp every thing human, it will be found, that excellence and infirmity are so insepa∣rably wound up in each other, that a man derives the soreness of temper, and irritability of nerve, which make him uneasy to others, and unhappy in himself, from those exquisite feelings, and that elevated pitch of thought, by which, as the apostle expresses it on a more serious cccasion, he is, as it were, out of the body.</P>
<P>IT is not astonishing, therefore, when the spirit is carried away by the mag∣nificence of its own ideas,
<Q><PB N="190" REF="195"/>Not touch'd but rapt, not waken'd but inspir'd,</Q>
that the frail body, which is the na∣tural victim of pain, disease, and death, should not always be able to follow the mind in its aspiring flights, but should be as imperfect as if it belonged only to an ordinary soul.</P>
<P>BESIDES, might not Providence intend to humble human pride, by presenting to our eyes so mortifying a view of the weakness and infirmity of even his best work? Perhaps man, who is already but a little lower than the angels, might, like the revolted spirits, totally have shaken off obedience and sub∣mission to his Creator, had not God wisely tempered human excellence with a certain consciousness of its own im∣perfection. But though this inevitable alloy of weakness may frequently be
<PB N="191" REF="196"/>found in the best characters, yet how can that be the source of triumph and exaltation to any, which, if properly weighed, must be the deepest motive of humiliation to all? A good-natured man will be so far from rejoicing, that he will be secretly troubled, whenever he reads that the greatest Roman moralist was tainted with avarice, and the greatest British philosopher with ve∣nality.</P>
<P>IT is remarked by Pope, in his Es∣say on Criticism, that,
<Q>Ten censure wrong for one who writes amiss.</Q>
But I apprehend it does not therefore follow that to judge, is more difficult than to write. If this were the case, the critic would be superior to the poet, whereas it appears to be directly
<PB N="192" REF="197"/>the contrary. "The critic, (says the great champion of Shakespeare,) but fashions the body of a work, the poet must add the soul, which gives force and direction to its actions and gestures." It should seem that the reason why so many more judge wrong, than write ill, is because the number of readers is beyond all proportion greater than the number of writers. Every man who reads, is in some measure a critic, and, with very common abilities, may point out real faults and material er∣rors in a very well written book; but it by no means follows that he is able to write any thing comparable to the work which he is capable of censuring. And unless the numbers of those who write, and of those who judge, were more equal, the calculation seems not to be quite fair.</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="198"/>A CAPACITY for relishing works of genius is the indubitable sign of a good taste. But if a proper disposition and ability to enjoy the compositions of others, entitle a man to the claim of reputation, it is still a far inferior de∣gree of merit to his who can invent and produce those compositions, the bare disquisition of which gives the critic no small share of fame.</P>
<P>THE president of the royal academy in his admirable <HI>Discourse</HI> on <HI>imitation,</HI> has set the folly of depending on unas∣sisted genius, in the clearest light; and has shewn the necessity of adding the knowledge of others, to our own native powers, in his usual striking and master∣ly manner. <Q>The mind, says he, is a barren soil, is a soil soon exhausted, and will produce no crop, or only one, unless it be continually fertiliz∣ed,
<PB N="194" REF="199"/>and enriched with foreign mat∣ter.</Q></P>
<P>YET it has been objected that study is a great enemy to originality; but even if this were true, it would per∣haps be as well that an author should give us the ideas of still better writers, mixed and assimilated with the matter in his own mind, as those crude and undigested thoughts which he values under the notion that they are original. The sweetest honey neither tastes of the rose, the honeysuckle, nor the carna∣tion, yet it is compounded of the very essence of them all.</P>
<P>IF in the other fine arts this accu∣mulation of knowledge is necessary, it is indispensably so in poetry. It is a fatal rashness for any one to trust too much to their own stock of ideas.
<PB N="195" REF="200"/>He must invigorate them by exercise, polish them by conversation, and in∣crease them by every species of elegant and virtuous knowledge, and the mind will not fail to reproduce with interest those seeds, which are sown in it by study and observation. Above all, let every one guard against the dan∣gerous opinion that he knows enough: an opinion that will weaken the energy and reduce the powers of the mind, which, though once perhaps vigorous and effectual, will be sunk to a state of literary imbecility, by cherishing vain and presumptuous ideas of its own independence.</P>
<P>FOR instance, it may not be necessary that a poet should be deeply skilled in the Linnaean system; but it must be allowed that a general acquaintance with plants and flowers will furnish
<PB N="196" REF="201"/>him with a delightful and profitable spe∣cies of instruction. He is not obliged to trace Nature in all her nice and varied operations, with the minute accuracy of a Boyle, or the laborious investiga∣tion of a Newton; but his <HI>good sense</HI> will point out to him that no inconside∣rable portion of philosophical know∣ledge is requisite to the completion of his literart character. The sciences are more independent, and require little or no assistance from the graces of poetry; but poetry, if she would charm and instruct, must not be so haughty; she must be contented to borrow of the sciences, many of her choicest allusions, and many of her most graceful embellishments; and does it not magnify the character of true poesy, that she includes within herself all the scattered graces of every separate art?</P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="202"/>THE rules of the great masters in criticism may not be so necessary to the forming a good taste, as the ex∣amination of those original mines from whence they drew their treasures of knowledge.</P>
<P>THE three celebrated Essays on the Art of Poetry do not teach so much by their laws as by their examples; the dead letter of their rules is less in∣structive than the living spirit of their verse. Yet these rules are to a young poet, what the study of logarithms is to a young mathematician; they do not so much contribute to form his judgment, as afford him the satisfac∣tion of convincing him that he is right. They do not preclude the difficulty of the operation; but at the conclusion of it, furnish him with a fuller demon∣stration that he has proceeded on pro∣per
<PB N="198" REF="203"/>principles. When he has well studied the masters in whose schools the first critics formed themselves, and fancies he has caught a spark of their divine Flame, it may be a good me∣thod to try his own compositions by the test of the critic rules, so far in∣deed as the mechanism of poetry goes. If the examination be fair and candid, this trial, like the touch of Ithuriel's spear, will detect every latent error, and bring to light every favourite failing.</P>
<P>GOOD taste always suits the measure of its admiration to the merit of the composition it examines. It accom∣modates its praises, or its censure, to the excellence of a work, and appro∣priates it to the nature of it. General applause, or indiscriminate abuse, is the sign of a vulgar understanding. There are certain blemishes which the
<PB N="199" REF="204"/>judicious and good-natured reader will candidly overlook. But the false sub∣lime, the tumour which is intended for greatness, the distorted figure, the puerile conceit, and the incongruous metaphor, these are defects for which scarcely any other kind of merit can atone. And yet there may be more hope of a writer (especially if he be a a young one), who is now and then guilty of some of these faults, than of one who avoids them all, not through judgment, but feebleness, and who, instead of deviating into error is con∣tinually falling short of excellence. The meer absence of error implies that moderate and inferior degree of merit with which a cold heart and a phleg∣matic taste will be better satisfied than with the magnificent irregularities of exalted spirits. It stretches some minds to an uneasy extension to be obliged
<PB N="200" REF="205"/>to attend to compositions superlatively excellent; and it contracts liberal souls to a painful narrowness to descend to books of inferior merit. A work of capital genius, to a man of an ordinary mind, is the bed of Procrustes to one of a short stature, the man is too little to fill up the space assigned him, and undergoes the torture in attempting it: and a moderate, or low production to a man of bright talents, is the pu∣nishment inflicted by Mezentius; the living spirit has too much animation to endure patiently to be in contact with a dead body.</P>
<P>TASTE seems to be a sentiment of the soul which gives the bias to opinion, for we feel before we reflect. Without this sentiment, all knowledge, learning and opinion, would be cold, inert materials, whereas they become active
<PB N="201" REF="206"/>principles when stirred, kindled, and inflamed by this animating quality.</P>
<P>THERE is another feeling which is called Enthusiasm. The enthusiasm of sensible hearts is so strong, that it not only yields to the impulse with which striking objects act on it, but such hearts help on the effect by their own sensibility. In a scene where Shakespeare and Garrick give perfec∣tion to each other, the feeling heart does not merely accede to the delirium they occasion: it does more, it is en∣amoured of it, it solicits the delusion, it sues to be deceived, and grudgingly cherishes the sacred treasure of its feel∣ings. The poet and performer concur in carrying us
<Q>Beyond this visible diurnal sphere,</Q>
they bear us aloft in their airy course with unresisted rapidity, if they meet not with any obstruction
<PB N="202" REF="207"/>from the coldness of our own feelings. Perhaps, only a few fine spirits can enter into the detail of their writing and acting; but the multitude do not enjoy less acutely, because they are not able philosophically to analyse the sources of their joy or sorrow. If the others have the advantage of judging, these have at least the privilege of feeling: and it is not from complaisance to a few leading judges, that they burst into peals of laughter, or melt into delightful agony; their hearts de∣cide, and that is a decision from which there lies no appeal. It must how∣ever be confessed, that the nicer sepa∣rations of character, and the lighter and almost imperceptible shades which sometimes distinguish them, will not be intimately relished, unless there be a consonancy of taste as well as feel∣ing in the spectator; though where the
<PB N="203" REF="208"/>passions are principally concerned, the profane vulgar come in for a larger portion of the universal delight, than critics and connoisseurs are willing to allow them.</P>
<P>YET enthusiasm, though the natu∣ral concomitant of genius, is no more genius itself, than drunkenness is cheer∣fulness; and that enthusiasm which discovers itself on occasions not worthy to excite it, is the mark of a wretched judgment and a false taste.</P>
<P>NATURE produces innumerable ob∣jects: to imitate them, is the province of Genius; to direct those imitations, is the property of Judgment; to decide on their effects, is the business of Taste. For Taste, who sits as supreme judge on the productions of Genius, is not satisfied when she merely imitates Na∣ture:
<PB N="204" REF="209"/>she must also, says an ingeni∣ous French writer, imitate <HI>beautiful</HI> Nature. It requires no less judgment to reject than to choose, and Genius might imitate what is vulgar, under pretence that it was natural, if Taste did not carefully point out those ob∣jects which are most proper for imita∣tion. It also requires a very nice dis∣cernment to distinguish verisimilitude from truth; for there is a truth in Taste nearly as conclusive as demon∣stration in mathematics.</P>
<P>GENIUS, when in the full impetu∣osity of its career, often touches on the very brink of error; and is, perhaps, never so near the verge of the preci∣pice, as when indulging its sublimest flights. It is in those great, but dan∣gerous moments, that the curb of vigilant judgment is most wanting:
<PB N="205" REF="210"/>while safe and sober Dulness observes one tedious and insipid round of tire∣some uniformity, and steers equally clear of eccentricity and of beauty. Dulness has few redundancies to re∣trench, few luxuriancies to prune, and few irregularities to smooth. These, though errors, are the errors of Ge∣nius, for there is rarely redundancy without plenitude, or irregularity with∣out greatness. The excesses of Genius may easily be retrenched, but the de∣ficiencies of Dulness can never be sup∣plied.</P>
<P>THOSE who copy from others will doubtless be less excellent than those who copy from Nature. To imitate imitators, is the way to depart too far from the great original herself. The latter copies of an engraving retain fainter and fainter traces of the sub∣ject,
<PB N="206" REF="211"/>to which the earlier impressions bore so strong a resemblance.</P>
<P>IT seems very extraordinary, that it should be the most difficult thing in the world to be natural; and that it should be harder to hit off the manners of real life, and to delineate such cha∣racters as we converse with every day, than to imagine such as do not exist. But caricature is much easier than an exact outline, and the colouring of fancy less difficult than that of truth.</P>
<P>People do not always know what taste they have, till it is awakened by some corresponding object; nay, genius it∣self is a fire, which in many minds would never blaze, if not kindled by some external cause.</P>
<P>NATURE, that munificent mother, when she bestows the power of judg∣ing,
<PB N="207" REF="212"/>accompanies it with the capacity of enjoying. The judgment, which is clear sighted, points out such objects as are calculated to inspire love, and the heart instantaneously attaches itself to whatever is lovely.</P>
<P>IN regard to literary reputation, a great deal depends on the state of learning in the particular age or na∣tion, in which an author lives. In a dark and ignorant period, moderate knowledge will entitle its possessor to a considerable share of fame; whereas, to be distinguished in a polite and let∣tered age, requires striking parts and deep erudition.</P>
<P>WHEN a nation begins to emerge from a state of mental darkness, and to strike out the first rudiments of im∣provement, it chalks out a few strong
<PB N="208" REF="213"/>but incorrect sketches, gives the rude out-lines of general art, and leaves the filling up to the leisure of happier days, and the refinement of more en∣lightened times. Their drawing is a rude <HI>Sbozzo,</HI> and their poetry wild minstrelsy.</P>
<P>PERFECTION of taste is a point which a nation no sooner reaches, than it overshoots; and it is more difficult to return to it, after having passed it, than it was to attain when they fell short of it. Where the arts begin to languish after having flourished, they feldom indeed fall back to their origi∣nal barbarism, but a certain feebleness of exertion takes place, and it is more difficult to recover them from this dying languor to their proper strength, than it was to polish them from their former redeness; for it is a less for∣midable
<PB N="209" REF="214"/>undertaking to refine barba∣rity, than to stop decay: the first may be laboured into elegance, but the latter will rarely be strengthened into vigour.</P>
<P>TASTE exerts itself at first but feebly and imperfectly: it is repressed and kept back by a crowd of the most discou∣raging prejudices: like an infant prince, who, though born to reign, yet holds an idle sceptre, which he has not power to use, but is obliged to see with the eyes, and hear through the ears of other men.</P>
<P>A WRITER of correct taste will hard∣ly ever go out of his way, even in search of embellishment: he will study to attain the best end by the most na∣tural means; for he knows that what is not natural cannot be beautiful, and
<PB N="210" REF="215"/>that nothing can be beautiful out of its own place; for an improper situ∣ation will convert the most striking beauty into a glaring defect. When by a well-connected chain of ideas, or a judicious succession of events, the reader is snatched to <Q>Thebes or Athens,</Q> what can be more imper∣tinent than for the poet to obstruct the operation of the passion he has just been kindling, by introducing a con∣ceit which contradicts his purpose, and interrupts his business? Indeed, we cannot be transported, even in idea, to those places, if the poet does not manage so adroitly as not to make us sensible of the journey: the instant we feel we are travelling, the writer's art fails, and the delirium is at an end.</P>
<P>PROSERPINE, says Ovid, would have been restored to her mother Ceres, had
<PB N="211" REF="216"/>not Ascalaphus seen her stop to gather a golden apple, when the terms of her restoration were, that she should taste nothing. A story pregnant with in∣struction for lively writers, who by neglecting the main business, and go∣ing out of the way for false gratifica∣tions, lose sight of the end they should principally keep in view. It was this false taste that introduced the number∣less <HI>concetti,</HI> which disgrace the bright∣est of the Italian poets; and this is the reason, why the reader only feels short and interrupted snatches of delight in perusing the brilliant but unequal compositions of Ariosto, instead of that unbroken and undiminished plea∣sure, which he constantly receives from Virgil, from Milton, and generally from Tasso. The first-mentioned Ita∣lian is the Atalanta, who will interrupt the most eager career, to pick up the
<PB N="212" REF="217"/>glittering mischief, while the Man∣tuan and the British bards, like Hip∣pomenes, press on warm in the pur∣suit, and unseduced by temptation.</P>
<P>A WRITER of real taste will take great pains in the perfection of his style, to make the reader believe that he took none at all. The writing which ap∣pears to be most easy, will be gene∣rally found to be least imitable. The most elegant verses are the most easily retained, they fasten themselves on the memory, without its making any effort to preserve them, and we are apt to ima∣gine, that what is remembered with ease, was written without difficulty.</P>
<P>To conclude; Genius is a rare and precious gem, of which few know the worth; it is sitter for the cabinet of the connoisseur, than for the com∣merce
<PB N="213" REF="218"/>of mankind. Good sense is a bank-bill, convenient for change, ne∣gotiable at all times, and current in all places. It knows the value of small things, and considers that an aggregate of them makes up the sum of human affairs. It elevates common concerns into matters of importance, by performing them in the best man∣ner, and at the most suitable season. Good sense carries with it the idea of equality, while Genius is always sus∣pected of a design to impose the burden of superiority; and respect is paid to it with that reluctance which always attends other imposts, the lower or∣ders of mankind generally repining most at demands, by which they are least liable to be affected.</P>
<P>As it is the character of Genius to penetrate with a lynx's beam into
<PB N="214" REF="219"/>unfathomable abysses and uncreated worlds, and to see what is <HI>not,</HI> so it is the property of good sense to distin∣guish perfectly, and judge accurately what really <HI>is.</HI> Good sense has not so piercing an eye, but it has as clear a sight: it does not penetrate so deeply, but as far as it <HI>does</HI> see, it discerns distinctly. Good sense is a judicious mechanic, who can produce beauty and convenience out of suitable means; but Genius (I speak with reverence of the immeasurable distance) bears some remote resemblance to the divine ar∣chitect, who produced perfection of beauty without any visible materials, <HI>who spake, and it was created;</HI> who said, <HI>Let it be, and it was.</HI></P>
