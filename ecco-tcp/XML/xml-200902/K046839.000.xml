<L>Thy keenest Satire bears the silliest Phrase,</L>
<L>And, Oh! how much unworthy of our Praise:</L>

<L>A Fool's a resolute and sturdy Beast,</L>

<L>How much we owe to such a Pen as thine,</L>

<L>Fondly they write each other's Follies down,</L>

<L>A Man is wond'rous strange with such a Head:</L>

<L>And struck afresh, afresh the Smile renews.</L>
<L>See 'mongst the Crowd new endless Follies rise;</L>
<L>Whilst all for Wit contend, a glorious Prize!</L>
<L>Each Blockhead boasts how just his own Pretence,</L>
<L>And proves how much he wants of common Sense.</L>

<L>To tear the Product of a worthy Muse)</L>
<L>They plague your Ears, then fly the Place, or stay</L>

<L><PB N="10" REF="9"/>As soon I'd go to <HI>Smithfield</HI>'s dirty Fair,</L>
