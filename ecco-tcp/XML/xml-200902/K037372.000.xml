<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Written by the AUTHOR of the FARCE. And Spoken by Mr. BANNISTER, Jun.</BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>WELL, here you are—expectant all, no doubt,</L>
<L>Guessing what this same Farce can be about.</L>
<L>"The First Floor! La!"—exclaims a City Dame,</L>
<L>"Upon my word, a monstrous pretty name!</L>
<L>"Deary, we'll go and see it—there are jokes,</L>
<L>"Depend upon it, on low vulgar folks,</L>
<L>"Who into nasty lodgings needs must pop;</L>
<L>"And can't afford, like us, to keep a shop."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Tell me, Sir Harry,"—lisps a titled fair,</L>
<L>"What is this Farce—and pray who will be there?</L>
<L>"Shall one be vapour'd with their empty rows,</L>
<L>"Or blest in crowds of faces that one knows?"</L>
<L>"Can't say, 'pon onnor, Ma'am," replies Sir Harry:</L>
<L>"As for the Piece—suppose it can't miscarry,</L>
<L>"If cramm'd with jests on <HI>us,</HI> as heretofore,</L>
<L>"To make the creatures in the galleries roar.</L>
<L>"These First Floor Authors are quite new to me—</L>
<L>"I thought they liv'd in Garrets—He! he! he!"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Lud,"—cries her ladyship,—"I dare to say</L>
<L>"This First Floor points at poor dear Lady K.</L>
<L>"She supt with we know who—we all know where—</L>
<L>"Some folks have taken lodgings near the square.</L>
<L>"Thus to stab characters, one's feeling shocks—</L>
<L>"John—run to Fosbrook—I must have a box."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB REF="5"/>
<L>"Psha!" snarls old Quidnunc—"I'll lay five to "four,</L>
<L>"There's nought but politicks in this First Floor.</L>
<L>"Sly strokes at Ministers—I smell a rat—</L>
<L>"Botany Bay—the Treaty—and all that."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Done," says Jack Spruce,—"I'll bett you what "you please,</L>
<L>"They will be witty on the ladies keys:</L>
<L>"Or, as the last new joke their purpose suits,</L>
<L>"Abuse box-lobby heroes, and their boots."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now, while conjecture marks each sapient phiz,</L>
<L>I'll give you just a sketch of what it is.</L>
<L>Our First Floor's fitted up, in hopes of striking</L>
<L>Those who to mirth and whim bear hearty liking:</L>
<L>In whom by fashion, nature, ne'er supprest,</L>
<L>With bursts of honest laughter greets each jest.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Our Floor thus lett—the graver critics scorning,</L>
<L>We hope our Lodgers will not give us warning.</L>

<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="scene">
<HEAD>SCENE I. An Inn in London.</HEAD>
<STAGE>Enter LANDLORD and MONFORD.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Land.</SPEAKER>
<P>WELCOME to town, your ho∣nour!—a long while since I saw your honour—was saying but this very morning that it was many months since I saw my worthy master, Squire Monford.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Monf.</SPEAKER>
<P>Say so still, Landlord—for I am come to town incog, and wish to conceal my arrival here.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Land.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! a pair of fine eyes in the case! you have sprung all the game about the country, and now you are coming to poach on some poor fellow's manor in London.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Monf.</SPEAKER>
<P>No faith, there is no poaching in the case; I mean to take out a licence for sporting on a certain manor, call'd Matrimony.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="2" REF="8"/>
<SPEAKER>"Land.</SPEAKER>
<P>Matrimony! Lord, Sir, 'tis well enough for your dog-trots—we must, to be sure, have cattle for the high road business of life; but who the devil wou'd think of running a race∣horse in a post-chaise?—'tis time enough to put him in harness when he is no longer able to win a sweepstakes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>"Monf.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why look'e, Landlord, I don't think that twenty years of dissipation will qualify me the better for a husband: I look on marriage as a sort of partnership, in which I mean to en∣gage whilst I can bring youth, good spirits, and a good constitution, as my share of the stock in trade: but when a pretty girl finds herself in∣trapp'd into a connection with a bankrupt trader, can he be angry with her for taking measures to dissolve the partnership?"</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Land.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, your honour—and this intended fair partner of yours—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Monf.</SPEAKER>
<P>She is coming to town with her father, and will be in this house in the course of an hour or two.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Land.</SPEAKER>
<P>The old story, I suppose—the father averse to the match.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Monf.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, unfortunately for me—but my charmer has consented to a private marriage; I am now going in search of lodgings for us, and shall be with you again presently.</P>
<STAGE>[Exit.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Land.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! there he goes—as pretty a fellow, aye, and as good a customer, as an inn-keeper wou'd wish to live by—never knew him look at
<PB N="3" REF="9"/>
the items of a bill in my life—always paid it the moment he saw the sum total, and submitted to be cheated like a gentleman.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter SIMON.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Simon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Landlord! how are you, my boy? Come, let's have a glass <STAGE>[sitting down at the table]</STAGE> you are a jolly fellow.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Land.</SPEAKER>
<P>And i'faith you seem to be the same—I think it is now three days since you came to town on the Bury-fly, during which time you have scarcely been sober three hours.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Simon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Psha! psha! 'tis only my not being us'd to ride on the roof of the coach that made me giddy—a sudden exaltation may turn better heads than mine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Land.</SPEAKER>
<P>And pray have you no business in town?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>"Simon.</SPEAKER>
<P>None of my own.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Land.</SPEAKER>
<P>But you have some of your master's?"</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Simon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I have a letter from my master to his son, which I was order'd to deliver directly, but faith I forgot it; "and it don't much signify: I hate to be a messenger of ill news.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>"Land.</SPEAKER>
<P>You know the contents then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>"Simon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes; my old master is coming to town to visit his son:" aye, here is the letter.—<HI>To Mr. John Whimsey, Junior, at Mrs. Pattypan's, Pastry-cook, in Piccadilly.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Land.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hey-day! why you are not going to open your master's letter?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Simon.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Certainly I will; my master wou'd make</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="10"/>
no ceremony in opening a letter of mine— <STAGE>[reading the letter]</STAGE> <HI>Dear John, I send you this by my man Si∣mon, who will deliver it to you immediately on his ar∣rival in London—</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Land.</SPEAKER>
<P>And you have been here three days al∣ready.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Simon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, Landlord, you don't drink—here's t'ye— <STAGE>[drinks.]</STAGE></P>
<P><HI>I am coming to town to compleat the purchase of my neighbour Squander's estate, and shall take up my quarters at your lodgings for two or three days; I shall bring your sister with me, as I hear there is a rakish young dog, of the name of Monford, has taken it in his head to fall in love with her, and I don't chuse to trust her out of my sight.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Land.</SPEAKER>
<P>Zounds! why did not you tell me at first who was your master.— <STAGE>[Aside]</STAGE> If I had but known it before Monford left the house!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Simon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, between you and me, I am half∣asham'd to own my master—he is as suspicious of every body about him, as if he had been bred a rogue himself—"a servant has not much credit in the place, I assure you."</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Land.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hey-day! here's a post-chaise come to the door.</P>

<P> Mind the portmanteau, sirrah, d'ye hear, and take care none of the bundles are stolen.</P>
<STAGE>[Exit Landlord.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Simon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, there, his suspicions are beginning already—if he has lost but a button from his coat, he'll put the postillion to his oath, and have the very horses taken before a magistrate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>"Land.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I must run, and prepare to re∣ceive him.</P>
<STAGE>[Exit.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>"Simon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, so must I; and with the same kind of reception—a good lye, and a smiling countenance."</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter WHIMSEY, CHARLOTTE, and LANDLORD.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Land.</SPEAKER>
<P>This way, Madam—this way, Sir—I hope your honour has had a good journey.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Whim.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, I have not had a good journey; I have had lame horses, and drunken drivers—dust from the road—extortion from the inn-keepers, and bad halfpence from the turnpikes.—A blight upon honesty and good manners blows from this city of London, to every point of the compass.—It is a mere ocean of knavery, with a continual spring∣tide, which infects all the streams of fresh-water round the country, and makes them brackish up to their very source.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Land.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis very true, your honour, travelling is very dear now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="6" REF="12"/>
<SPEAKER>Whim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear, with a vengeance!—I remember the time when a man cou'd be choak'd upon a dusty road for seven pence a mile; but now one must pay a shilling a mile for the pleasure of being smother'd, because it is one of the luxuries of life.— <STAGE>[To Charlotte.]</STAGE> You have not lost your watch, have you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Char.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, no, Sir, all is safe about me— <STAGE>[aside]</STAGE> except my heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Whim.</SPEAKER>
<P>My pockets were all safe when I got out of the chaise; I suppose I have hardly lost any thing since I came into the house.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Land.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lord, Sir, what do you mean?—In my house!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Whim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Egad, I don't know, friend; but there are much finer houses than yours in this town, where a man may go in with full pockets, and come out with empty ones.—But where is my rascal?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Simon.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>[coming forward]</STAGE> Here am I, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Whim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, sirrah, I suppose my son and you have been laying your heads together to cheat the old fellow, when he came to town—what did he say when he read my letter?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Simon.</SPEAKER>
<P>He presents his dutiful respects, and anxiously expects the pleasure of seeing you—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Whim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Go to be buried, I dare say he does—but I'm resolv'd to live temperately, out of spite to him.—Landlord, see if the coach is come <STAGE>[Exit Landlord].</STAGE> And you <STAGE>[to Simon]</STAGE> go and see all the luggage put safely into it— <STAGE>[Exit Simon].</STAGE> Come, Charlotte, uncloud your countenance—
<PB N="7" REF="13"/>
don't tell me of having lost your heart—a young girl's heart is like a tame pigeon, let her throw it away ten times in a month, it will be sure to come back again.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter SIMON.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Simon.</SPEAKER>
<P>The coach is ready, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Whim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well, be sure then and take the number; and, d'ye hear, if there is any cordage from the trunks left, save it, Simon—though it be ever so little, it may serve to tie up something or other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Upon my word, Mr. Whimsey, your behaviour is beyond all bearing—It is a disgrace to any sober family to have such a rake for a lodger.</P>

<P>What signifies reasoning with you? you are so thoughtless, so dissipated—keep such company, and such hours—you'll shorten your days.</P>

<SPEAKER>Y. Whim.</SPEAKER>
<P>But then, as the old saying is, I lengthen my nights, Mrs. Pattypan, and so it comes pretty nearly to the same end.</P>

<P>How often must I beg of you to quit the premises? I've given you warning every day for this month past, and you won't take it.</P>

<P>'Tis a common complaint against young people, that they won't take warning.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. Patt.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have put up a bill in the shop window already—A First Floor to be let furnished—it will not long remain empty, I dare say—nay, a gentleman was here just now to view the apart∣ments.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Whim.</SPEAKER>
<P>You take equal care of your lodgings as of your heart, I perceive, Mrs. Pattypan—you let nothing of yours remain long unoccupied—I think your late husband has been dead about two months, and you are now preparing for the recep∣tion of a second.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Patt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Who do you mean, Sir?</P>

<P>I mean your apprentice, Tim Tart∣lett; and a very good choice too, let me tell you, Mrs. Pattypan, he has serv'd his time to his mas∣ter's business—and, I dare say, you will find him a very useful partner—But I see him coming, and I won't interrupt a love conversation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Patt.</SPEAKER>
<P>I understand your sneers, Sir. But

I hope, before you quit the house, you mean to discharge your debts—you are pretty much in my books.</P>

<SPEAKER>Y. Whim.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is owing to my great respect for you—I hope I shall never be out of your books—Adieu, my dear old girl! If I can't get a bed elsewhere—perhaps I may pop in here—so you'll let your maid Nancy sit up for me.</P>

<SPEAKER>Whim.</SPEAKER>
<P>There, Sirrah, put the portmanteau in the corner—one shou'd always have an eye to one's property. <STAGE>"[To Mrs. Patt.]</STAGE> Well, Mrs. Pattypan, what do you think of my son—how d'ye like him for a lodger?"</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Patt.</SPEAKER>

<P>Mrs. Pattypan, let us have tea as soon as you can—I am rather fatigued with my journey. <STAGE>[Exeunt Mrs. Pattypan and Charlotte.</STAGE> <STAGE>[Whim. solus.]</STAGE> I'faith, I like Jack's lodgings mightily—here are all the pictures I gave him, and the library of books—he has taken great care of them, I see—all look as good as new; and not a volume displac'd—he is a careful reader, I dare say—I shall fancy myself quite at home among my old acquaintance. <STAGE>[Looking round]</STAGE> But who have we here?</P>

<P>They seem to be very fine, indeed, Sir.</P>

<P>Let me have a pair of slippers, my lad, directly—I long to be out of my boots <STAGE>[Exit Frank]</STAGE> Nothing so pleasant as to be perfectly at one's ease—that's my opinion—</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Whim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh yes, I am, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Monf.</SPEAKER>
<P>In short, I expect my sister from the country every moment; and perhaps the presence of a third person might not be quite agreeable to her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Whim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, as to that, I expect my daughter every moment too, and we may all drink tea to∣gether. <STAGE>[Tea brought in by Nancy]</STAGE> — <STAGE>[To Nancy]</STAGE> Do tell my daughter to make haste. <STAGE>[Exit Nancy]</STAGE> — <STAGE>[Aside]</STAGE> There can be no harm to invite him, as he is a friend of Jack's.—May I ask your name, Sir?</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Monf.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir!</P>
</SP>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Whim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't be disappointed, young man—you have had a devilish lucky escape in missing my daughter, I assure you—for not a shilling wou'd I have given her, had she thrown herself away on you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Monf.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>[Aside]</STAGE> What the devil shall I say?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Whim.</SPEAKER>
<P>I suppose you are muttering curses against the old fellow, because he won't suffer you to hum him—come, use no ceremony—let me hear what I am.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Monf.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>[Aside]</STAGE> I have it—You are, Sir, indeed a friend.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Whim.</SPEAKER>
<P>For depriving you of your wife—that is indeed the part of a modern friend.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>"Monf.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thank you for your candour—you have discover'd to me my mistake.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>"Whim.</SPEAKER>
<P>You expected then that the old cod∣ger wou'd have whimper'd a little, join'd your
<PB N="17" REF="23"/>
hands, and have given you half his fortune, for making a fool of him."</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Monf.</SPEAKER>
<P>"I own it—but I see I was in an er∣ror." Miss Charlotte, I thought you were a woman of fortune—your father has convinc'd me that you will no longer be such, if you marry me; I shou'd therefore be guilty of the greatest injustice in wishing to sacrifice your happiness to the gratification of my passion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Char.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir—you—you are perfectly in the right—I feel the delicacy of your conduct—and—you may be sure I approve it.</P>
<STAGE>[Exit Charlotte.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Whim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Give me your hand, Monford—Egad, I begin to think you are a devilish sensible fel∣low.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Monf.</SPEAKER>
<P>Between you and I, Mr. Whimsey, it won't do for younger brothers, like me, to fall in love.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Whim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly not. It may well be call'd <HI>falling</HI> in love. 'Tis in truth a false step, and many a man, who has once met with the accident, has found the ill effects of it ever afterwards.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Monf.</SPEAKER>
<P>Right, Sir, suppose now you were to re∣commend me to a wife—a rich widow, for in∣stance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Whim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Eh! why what say you to the lady of this mansion, Mrs. Pattypan?—My son Jack tells me, in his letters, she is worth a round sum.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Monf.</SPEAKER>
<P>A good thought, Sir; with your per∣mission, I'll step to Miss Whimsey, and tell her my resolution of courting the old lady directly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="18" REF="24"/>
<SPEAKER>Whim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't trouble yourself—I'll step to Miss Whimsey myself; and return immediately, to have a little more talk with you on the subject. Od'so! but while I am looking after my daughter, I may lose my portmanteau.</P>
<STAGE>[Exit Whimsey, and drags off his portmanteau.]</STAGE>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter FRANK.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>"Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>So, Sir, you are in a fine hobble here; this old man is the father of your mistress.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>"Monf.</SPEAKER>
<P>Even so, Frank—luckily a thought occurred to me, which I flatter myself has put him off his guard—I have pretended to give up his daughter, and pay my addresses to the old pastry-cook below stairs.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>"Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lord, Sir, this scheme is too absurd to pass on any man, however credulous he may be."</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Monf.</SPEAKER>
<P>"To be sure—but" if I can make him believe this absurdity but for a few hours, all may yet be well—I think I can easily find means to convey my dear girl out of the reach of her fa∣ther's power this evening.—Go instantly, Frank, and order a chaise to be at the corner of the street exactly at twelve o'clock.</P>
<STAGE>[Exit Frank.</STAGE>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter Mrs. PATTYPAN.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Patt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, your most obedient humble ser∣vant.—I did not understand that you expected your father in town.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="19" REF="25"/>
<SPEAKER>Monf.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nor I neither, Madam.— <STAGE>[Aside]</STAGE> So I must pass for the old fellow's son, I find.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Patt.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope, Sir, you like the lodgings, and don't think them dear at three guineas a week.</P>

<SPEAKER>Monf.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly not.</P>

<P>Aye; I knew we should agree, Sir, Ha! ha! ha!</P>

<P>Egad, he has put the question to her.— <STAGE>[Aside]</STAGE> Monford, I perceive you have begun the attack.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Monf.</SPEAKER>
<P>And have conquer'd too—only don't in∣terrupt me in my victory.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>"Whim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not I—you may say what you will before me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>"Monf.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye; but the lady won't care to speak before you. Pray now, Sir, leave us to our∣selves."</P>

<P>Oh, you had.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>"Mrs. Patt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; we were proceeding to set∣tle every thing."</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Whim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I am sure I wont interrupt you; and so good bye.— <STAGE>[Aside]</STAGE> I'll take the liberty of listening to their conversation, however—nothing but the evidence of my own ears can remove my suspicions.</P>

<P>Don't mind my father, Mrs. Pattypan, old folks have their peculiarities.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. Patt.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, Sir—I dare say it will be the same with you and I, when we grow old.— <STAGE>[Enter Whimsey, and retires to the back scene]</STAGE> But, how∣ever, to return to business—right reckoning makes long friends, as I us'd to tell my first husband—</P>

<P>Aye, I dare say we shall be very happy together.</P>

<P>I think you have no family, Mrs. Patty∣pan?</P>

<P>No, Sir, I never had any yet—but as I think of altering my situation, it may happen that—</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Monf.</SPEAKER>
<P>I understand you—but that will make no sort of difference to me.</P>

<P>Look ye, Mrs. Pattypan—as to his lit∣tle gallantries, as you call them, perhaps I know more of the matter than you do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Patt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Sir, you awaken my cu∣riosity.</P>
</SP>

<P>But, really, when I consider how disa∣greeable a task it is to interfere between man and wife—for such I consider you to be—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>"Mrs. Patt.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis very true, Sir—in all the quarrels that I had with my poor dear soul that's dead and gone (and many they were) we never admitted any body to interfere, but fought them out by ourselves.</P>

<P>AH! my dear little Nancy—how lucky I am, to meet with you alone.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nancy.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wish then, Sir, you would leave me alone as you found me: upon my word, Mr. Whimsey, I'll tell my mistress how rude you be∣have.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Whim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray don't, my dear—she will want to try my rudeness herself.—By the bye, where is the old woman?</P>

<SPEAKER>Nancy.</SPEAKER>
<P>At a neighbour's over the way—you know she is as jealous as Old Scratch of poor Mr. Timothy, and so she means to watch his coming home.</P>

<SPEAKER>Y. Whim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! ho! then she is out <STAGE>[aside]</STAGE> so much the better.— <STAGE>[to her]</STAGE> Nancy I want to give you a little good advice—step into my room with me, and—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nancy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Into <HI>your</HI> room! you have no room in this house, Mr. Whimsey; we have let the lodg∣ings.</P>

<P>Let the lodgings! with all my fur∣niture in them!—</P>

<SPEAKER>Nancy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pay what you owe, and you may have your furniture.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Whim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Death, and—but I can't stay to be in a passion—and so the lodgings are let?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nancy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye—there is an old gentleman, and one of the sweetest young ladies—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Whim.</SPEAKER>
<P>A young lady!—Egad I must see her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nancy.</SPEAKER>
<P>And give <HI>her</HI> a little good advice too, eh?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Whim.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be sure—nobody better qualify'd than myself to give good advice—I have receiv'd a great deal more than I make use of; and, as I scorn to be a miser, am ready to give it away to any one who will take it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nancy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Bless me, here comes Mr. Furnish, the upholsterer, who has been so often after you with his bill, and our neighbour, Mr. Snap, the bailiff, with him, I vow.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Whim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Furnish! that is the man to whom you have denied me so often—What shall I do—he never saw me, I believe?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nancy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Whim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I fear nothing. However, a little disguise of my dress may not be amiss—here is an old lac'd hat, and a morning-gown, which I guess, from its antique appearance, be∣longs to your old lodger.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="30" REF="36"/>
<SPEAKER>Nancy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; his servant has just been unpack∣ing his portmanteau.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nancy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your servant, Mr. Furnish; I suppose you want Mr. Whimsey?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Furn.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, my dear, I own a part of my business is with him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nancy.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll go and see if he's at home.</P>
<STAGE>[Exit.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Furn.</SPEAKER>
<P>You may save yourself that trouble, my dear: I am pretty sure he is within.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Whim.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think, Sir, Mr. Whimsey is in∣debted to you for the furniture of a house, taken by a very fine girl, who referr'd you to him for payment—I have read many of your letters to him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Furn.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir—a number of letters pass'd be∣tween us.—I suppose I have received a quire of paper from him at different times; and egad that is all I ever receiv'd from him.—You are his friend, I presume, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Whim.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am partial to him, I own; tho' I confess he has been duped by women.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Furn.</SPEAKER>
<P>That I can pardon, Sir. Gallantry has always been a part of <HI>my</HI> business.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Whim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Rather a small part of your business at present, I shou'd think, Mr. Furnish.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="31" REF="37"/>
<SPEAKER>Furn.</SPEAKER>
<P>But you were speaking of Mr. Whimsey, Sir;—I fear the poor gentleman is much dis∣tress'd.—Ah, Sir, there is no putting an old head on young shoulders.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Whim.</SPEAKER>
<P>And, really, if that cou'd be done, I don't think it wou'd be any great addition to a man's appearance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Furn.</SPEAKER>
<P>I dare say you wou'd take pleasure in affording him relief.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Whim.</SPEAKER>
<P>That I wou'd, I assure you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Furn.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mine is not a large bill <STAGE>[giving him the bill]</STAGE> and I believe I cou'd afford to make a small abatement in it—a trifling sum will save an un∣happy youth from disgrace.—Consider the exqui∣site luxury of a feeling mind in relieving distress—consider that generosity is part of the business of man.—Consider compassion— <STAGE>[Y. Whim. shakes his head.]</STAGE> You won't pay the bill—then come in Mr. Snap, and do your duty—follow me, and arrest him directly.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter SNAP.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Whim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hey-day! what's become of the ex∣quisite luxury of a feeling mind in relieving dis∣tress?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Furn.</SPEAKER>
<P>It may do very well for people of for∣tune; but a tradesmen shou'd never indulge in luxury.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Whim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Consider, generosity is part of the business of man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Furn.</SPEAKER>
<P>And a d—d losing trade it is—therefore it shan't be a part of <HI>my</HI> business.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Furn.</SPEAKER>
<P>His present disguise!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Whim.</SPEAKER>
<P>To deceive his creditors is, as you
