<SP>
<L>OUR modern Poets scarce know how to chuse</L>
<L>A subject worthy of the Tragic Muse;</L>
<L>For Bards so well have glean'd th' Historic field,</L>
<L>That scarce one sheaf th' exhausted ancients yield;</L>
<L>And these, our timid author leaves to men,</L>
<L>For classic themes demand a classic pen:</L>
<L>Yet still the wilds of fiction open lie,</L>
<L>A flow'ry prospect, and a boundless sky:</L>
<L>But hard the task the sober path to chuse,</L>
<L>And wand'ring Fancy's treacherous baits refuse.</L>
<L>—She dares not touch the Drama's <HI>nobler</HI> strings,</L>
<L>The fate of nations, and the fall of Kings;</L>
<L>The humbler scenes of private life she shews,</L>
<L>A simple story of domestic woes.</L>
<L>The weight of crowns, a kingdom's weal or woe,</L>
<L>How few can judge, because how few can know!</L>
<L>But here you all may boast the Critic's art,</L>
<L>Here, all are judges—who possess a heart.</L>
<L>To govern <HI>Empires</HI> is the lot of few,</L>
<L>But all who live have <HI>passions</HI> to subdue;</L>
<L>And, ev'n by Patriots let it be confess'd,</L>
<L><HI>These</HI> Rebel Subjects ought to be suppress'd,</L>
<L>These Ravagers which spoil the human breast.</L>
<L>Oh! deign to learn this obvious lesson here!</L>
<L>The verse is feeble, but the moral clear.</L>
<L>Your candour once endur'd our Author's lays,</L>
<L>Endure them now—that will be ample praise.</L>

<L>UNHAND me, gentlemen, by Heaven, I say,</L>
<L>I'll make a ghost of him who bars my way.</L>
<L><STAGE>Behind the scenes.</STAGE></L>
<L>Forth let me come—A Poetaster true,</L>
<L>As lean as Envy, and as baneful too;</L>
<L>On the dull audience let me vent my rage,</L>
<L>Or drive these <HI>female</HI> scribblers from the stage:</L>
<L>For scene or history, we've none but these,</L>
<L>The law of Liberty and Wit they seize</L>
<L>In Tragic—Comic—Pastoral—they dare to please.</L>
<L>Each puny Bard must surely burst with spite,</L>
<L>To find that women with such fame can write:</L>
<L>But, oh, your partial favour is the cause,</L>
<L>Who feed their follies with such full applause;</L>
<L>Yet still our tribe shall seek to blast their fame,</L>
<L>And ridicule each fair pretender's aim;</L>
<L>Where the dull duties of domestic life,</L>
<L>Wage with the Muse's toils eternal strife.</L>

<L>What motley cares <HI>Corilla's</HI> mind perplex,</L>
<L>While maids and metaphors conspire to vex!</L>
<L>In studious deshabille behold her sit,</L>
<L>A letter'd gossip, and a housewife wit;</L>
<L>At once invoking, though for different views,</L>
<L>Her gods, her cook, her millener, and muse,</L>
<L>Round her strew'd room, a frippery chaos lies,</L>
<L>A chequer'd wreck of <HI>notable</HI> and <HI>wise;</HI></L>
<L>Bills, Books, Caps, Couplets, Combs, a vary'd mass,</L>
<L>Oppress the toilet, and obscure the glass;</L>
<L>Unfinish'd here an Epigram is laid,</L>
<L>And there, a mantua-maker's Bill unpaid;</L>
<L>Here new-born Plays fore taste the town's applause,</L>
<L>There, dormant Patterns pine for future gauze;</L>
<L><PB N="vii" REF="6"/>
A moral Essay now is all her care,</L>
<L>A Satire next, and then a Bill of Fare:</L>
<L>A Scene she now projects, and now a Dish,</L>
<L>Here's Act the First—and here—remove with Fish.</L>
<L>Now while this Eye in a fine phrenzy rolls,</L>
<L>That, soberly casts up a Bill for Coals;</L>
<L>Black Pins and Daggers in one leaf she sticks,</L>
<L>And Tears and Thread, and Balls and Thimbles mix.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>Sappho,</HI> 'tis true, long vers'd in epic song,</L>
<L>For years esteem'd all household studies wrong;</L>
<L>When dire mishep, though neither shame nor sin,</L>
<L><HI>Sappho</HI> herself, and not her Muse, lies in.</L>
<L>The virgin Nine in terror fly the bower,</L>
<L>And matron Juno claims despotic power;</L>
<L>Soon Gothic hags the classic pile o'erturn,</L>
<L>A caudle-cup supplants the sacred urn;</L>
<L>Nor books, nor implements escape their rage,</L>
<L>They spike the ink-stand, and they rend the page;</L>
<L>Poems and Plays one barbarous fate partake,</L>
<L>Ovid and Plautus suffer at the stake,</L>
<L>And Aristotle's only sav'd—to wrap plumb cake.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet, shall a <HI>woman</HI> tempt the Tragic Scene?</L>
<L>And dare—but hold—I must repress my spleen;</L>
<L>I see your hearts are pledg'd to her applause,</L>
<L>White Shakespear's spirit seems to aid her cause;</L>
<L>Well pleas'd to aid—since o'er his sacred bier</L>
<L>A semale hand did ample trophies rear,</L>
<L>And gave the greenest laurel that is worshipp'd there.</L>

<L>WHAT fools are serious melancholy villains</L>
<L>I play a surer game, and screen my heart</L>

<L>And while my actions spring from sober thought,</L>
<L>They still appear th' effect of wild caprice,</L>
<L>And I, the thoughtless slave of giddy chance.</L>
<L>What but this frankness has engag'd the promise</L>
<L>Of young Orlando, to confide to me,</L>
<L>That secret grief which preys upon his heart?</L>
<L>'Tis dangerous, indiscreet hypocrisy</L>
<L>To seem too good: I am the careless Bertrand,</L>

The honest, undesigning, plain, blunt man:</L>

<SPEAKER>BERTRAND.</SPEAKER>
<L>O, my good Lord, your pardon—spare me, Sir,</L>

<L>And idle thoughtless hours which I should blush</L>
<L>To lay before your wife and temperate age.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GUILDFORD.</SPEAKER>
<L>Well, be it so—youth has a privilege,</L>
<L>And I should be asham'd could I forget</L>
<L>I have myself been young, and harshly chide</L>
<L>The not ungraceful levity of youth.</L>
<L>Prudence becomes moroseness, when it makes</L>
<L>A rigid inquisition of the fault,</L>
<L>Not of the man, perhaps, but of his youth:</L>
<L>Foibles that shame the head on which old Time</L>

<L>Call them both my daughters,</L>

<L>When Julia shall indeed become my daughter,</L>

<L>Crown the impatient vows of my brave son,</L>

<SPEAKER>GUILDFORD.</SPEAKER>
<L>'Twas the condition of her father's will,</L>
<L>My brave old fellow-soldier, and my friend;</L>
<L>He wish'd to see our ancient houses join'd</L>
<L>By this, our children's union; but the veteran</L>
<L>So highly valued military prowess,</L>
<L>That he bequeath'd his fortunes and his daughter</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="11"/>
To my young Rivers, on these terms alone,</L>
<L>That he shou'd early seek renown in arms;</L>
<L>And if he from the field return'd a conqueror,</L>
<L>That sun which saw him come victorious home</L>
<L>Shou'd witness their espousals. Yet he comes not!</L>

<L>The glory of my son is all his theme:</L>
<L>Oh! he recounts his virtues with such joy,</L>

<L>At first my foolish heart so much deceiv'd me,</L>
<L>I thought I lov'd him for my brother's sake;</L>

<L>Nor was that theme less grateful than the former.</L>
<L>I seem'd the very idol of his soul;</L>
