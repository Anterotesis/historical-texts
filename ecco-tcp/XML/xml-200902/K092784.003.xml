<HEAD>The CHOICE of HERCULES, A POEM.</HEAD>
<LG N="1">
<HEAD>I.</HEAD>
<L>NOW had the son of Jove mature, attain'd</L>
<L>The joyful prime: when youth, elate and gay,</L>
<L>Steps into life; and follows unrestrain'd</L>
<L>Where passion leads, or prudence points the way.</L>
<L>In the pure mind, at those ambiguous years,</L>
<L>Or vice, rank weed, first strikes her pois'nous root;</L>
<L>Or haply virtue's op'ning bud appears</L>
<L>By just degrees; fair bloom of fairest fruit:</L>
<L>For, if on youth's untainted thought imprest,</L>
<L>The gen'rous purpose still shall warm the manly breast.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="2">
<HEAD>II.</HEAD>
<L>As on a day, reflecting on his age</L>
<L>For highest deeds now ripe, Alcides sought</L>
<L>Retirement; nurse of contemplation sage;</L>
<L>Step following step, and thought fucceeding thought:</L>
<L>Musing, with steady pace the youth pursu'd</L>
<L>His walk; and lost in meditation stray'd</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="5"/>
Far in a lonely vale, with solitude</L>
<L>Conversing; while intent his mind survey'd</L>
<L>The dubious path of life: before him lay</L>
<L>Here virtue's rough ascent, there pleasure's flow'ry way.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="3">
<HEAD>III.</HEAD>
<L>Much did the view divide his wavering mind:</L>
<L>Now glow'd his breast with generous thirst of fame;</L>
<L>Now love of ease to softer thoughts inclin'd</L>
<L>His yielding soul, and quench'd the rising flame.</L>
<L>When, lo! far off two female forms he spies;</L>
<L>Direct to him their steps they seem to bear:</L>
<L>Both large and tall, exceeding human size;</L>
<L>Both, far exceeding human beauty, fair.</L>
<L>Graceful, yet each with different grace, they move:</L>
<L>This, striking sacred awe; that softer, winning love.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="4">
<HEAD>IV.</HEAD>
<L>The first, in native dignity surpass'd;</L>
<L>Artless and unadorn'd she pleas'd the more:</L>
<L>Health, o'er her looks, a genuine lustre cast;</L>
<L>A vest, more white than new-fall'n snow she wore.</L>
<L>August she trod, yet modest was her air;</L>
<L>Serene her eye, yet darting heav'nly fire.</L>
<L>Still she drew near; and nearer still more fair,</L>
<L>More mild appear'd: yet such as might inspire</L>
<L>Pleasure corrected with an awful fear;</L>
<L>Majestically sweet, and amiably severe.</L>
</LG>

<PB N="3" REF="6"/>
<HEAD>V.</HEAD>
<L>The other dame seem'd ev'n of fairer hue;</L>
<L>But bold her mien; unguarded rov'd her eye:</L>
<L>And her flush'd cheeks confess'd at nearer view</L>
<L>The borrow'd blushes of an artful dye.</L>
<L>All soft and delicate, with airy swim</L>
<L>Lightly she danc'd along; her robe betray'd</L>
<L>Thro' the clear texture every tender limb,</L>
<L>Height'ning the charms it only seem'd to shade:</L>
<L>And as it flow'd adown, so loose and thin,</L>
<L>Her stature shew'd more tall; more snowy-white, her skin.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="6">
<HEAD>VI.</HEAD>
<L>Oft with a smile she view'd herself askaunce;</L>
<L>Ev'n on her shade a conscious look she threw:</L>
<L>Then all around her cast a careless glance,</L>
<L>To mark what gazing eyes her beauty drew.</L>
<L>As they came near, before that other maid</L>
<L>Approaching decent, eagerly she press'd</L>
<L>With hasty step; nor of repulse afraid,</L>
<L>With freedom bland the wond'ring youth address'd;</L>
<L>With winning fondness on his neck she hung;</L>
<L>Sweet as the honey-dew flow'd her enchanting tongue.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="7">
<HEAD>VII.</HEAD>
<L>"Dear Hercules, whence this unkind delay?</L>
<L>"Dear youth; what doubts can thus distract thy mind?</L>
<L>"Securely follow, where I lead the way;</L>
<L>"And range thro' wilds of pleasure unconfin'd.</L>

"With me retire, from noise, and pain, and care;</L>
<L>"Embath'd in bliss, and wrapt in endless ease:</L>
<L>"Rough is the road to fame, thro' blood and war;</L>
<L>"Smooth is my way, and all my paths are peace.</L>

<L>"Leave honour to the wretch! pleasures were made for thee.</L>

<L>"Then will I grant thee all thy soul's desire;</L>
<L>"All that may charm thine ear, and please thy sight:</L>

<L>"The sumptuous feast, enhanc'd with musick's sound;</L>
<L>"Fittest to tune the melting soul to love:</L>

<L>"The fragrant bow'r, cool fountain, shady grove:</L>
<L>"Fresh flowers, to strew thy couch, and crown thy head;</L>
<L>"Joy shall attend thy steps, and ease shall smooth thy bed.</L>

<L>"These will I freely, constantly supply;</L>
<L>"Pleasures, nor earn'd with toil, nor mix'd with woe:</L>
<L>"Far from thy rest repining want shall fly;</L>
<L>"Nor labour bathe in sweat thy careful brow.</L>
<L>"Mature the copious harvest shall be thine;</L>
<L>"Let the laborious hind subdue the soil:</L>
<L>"Leave the rash soldier spoils of war to win;</L>
<L>"Won by the soldier thou shalt share the spoil:</L>

<L>Her winning voice the youth attentive caught:</L>
<L>He gaz'd impatient on the smiling maid;</L>
<L>Still gaz'd, and listen'd: then her name besought:</L>
<L>"My name, fair youth, is Happiness, she said.</L>
<L>"Well can my friends this envy'd truth maintain:</L>
<L>"They share my bliss; they best can speak my praise:</L>
<L>"Tho' slander call me Sloth—detraction vain!</L>
<L>"Heed not what slander, vain detracter, says:</L>

<L>"To blot the brightest worth, and blast the fairest name."</L>

<L>By this, arriv'd the fair majestick maid:</L>

<L>With manly tone, thy birth of heav'nly race;</L>

"Honour rewards the brave and bold alone;</L>
<L>"She spurns the timorous, indolent, and base:</L>
<L>"Danger and toil stand stern before her throne;</L>
<L>"And guard, (so Jove commands) the sacred place.</L>

<LG>
<L>HAIL LIBERTY! whose presence glads th' abode</L>
<L>Of heav'n itself, great attribute of God!</L>
<L>By thee sustain'd, th' unbounded spirit runs,</L>
<L>Moulds orbs on orbs, and lights up suns on suns;</L>
<L>By thee sustain'd, in love unwearied lives,</L>
<L>And uncontroul'd creates, supports, forgives:</L>
<L>No pow'r, or time, or space his will withstood;</L>
<L>Almighty! endless! infinite in good!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"If so, why not communicate the bliss,</L>
<L>"And let man know what this great blessing is?"</L>
<L>Say what proportion, creature, wouldst thou claim;</L>
<L>As thy creator's, in extent, the same!</L>
<L><PB N="39" REF="42"/>
Unless his other attributes were join'd</L>
<L>To poise the will, and regulate the mind,</L>
<L>Goodness to aim, and wisdom to direct,</L>
<L>What mighty mischiefs must we thence expect?</L>
<L>The maker knows his work; nor judg'd it fit</L>
<L>To trust the rash resolves of human wit:</L>
<L>Which prone to hurt, too blind to help, is still</L>
<L>Alike pernicious, mean it good or ill.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A whim, t' improvements making fond pretence,</L>
<L>Would burst a system in experiments;</L>
<L>Sparrows and cats indeed no more should fear,</L>
<L>But Saturn tremble in his distant sphere:</L>
<L>Give thee but footing in another world,</L>
<L>Say, Archimedes, where should we be hurl'd?</L>

<LG>
<L>A sprightly wit, with liquor in his head,</L>
<L>Would burn a globe to light him drunk to bed:</L>
<L>Th' Ephesian temple had escap'd the flame,</L>
<L>And heav'n's high dome had built the madman's fame.</L>

<L>The sullen might, (when malice boil'd within,)</L>
<L>Strike out the stars, to intimate his spleen:</L>
<L>Not poppy-heads had spoke a Tarquin crost;</L>
<L>Nature's chief spring had broke, and all been lost.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nor less destructive would this licence prove,</L>
<L>Tho' thy breast flam'd with universal love.</L>
<L>In vain were thy benevolence of soul;</L>
<L>Soon would thy folly disconcert the whole.</L>
<L>No rains, or snows, should discompose the air;</L>
<L>But flow'rs and sun-shine drain the weary year:</L>
<L><PB N="40" REF="43"/>
No clouds should sully the clear face of day;</L>
<L>No tempest rise,—to blow a plague away.</L>
<L>Mercy should reign untir'd, unstain'd with blood;</L>
<L>Spare the frail guilty,—to eat up the good:</L>
<L>In their defence, rise, sacred justice, rise!</L>
<L>Awake the thunder sleeping in the skies,</L>
<L>Sink a corrupted city in a minute:</L>

<L>Pick out the bad, and sweep them all away!</L>

<L>How wide, such lust of liberty confounds!</L>

<L>"Receiv'd as it's proprietor, and lord.</L>

"When trees and streams were made a general good;</L>

<L>O halcyon state! when man begun to live!</L>
<L>A blessing, worthy of a god to give!</L>

<L>Obedience, pow'r; and full contentment, wealth.</L>
<L>So happy once, was man! till the vain elf</L>
<L>Shook off his guide, and set up for himself.</L>
<L>Smit with the charms of independency,</L>

<L>Now, self-expos'd, he feels his naked state;</L>
<L>Shrinks with the blast, or melts before the heat:</L>
<L>And blindly wanders, as his fancy leads,</L>
<L>To starve on wastes, or feast on pois'nous weeds.</L>
<L>Now to the savage beasts an obvious prey;</L>
<L>Or crafty men, more savage still than they:</L>
<L><PB N="42" REF="45"/>
No less imprudent to his breast to take</L>
<L>The friend unfaithful, or th' envenom'd snake;</L>
<L>Equally fatal, whether on the Nile,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nor yet less blindly deviates learned pride;</L>
<L>In Aetna burn'd, or drown'd amid the tide:</L>
<L>Boasts of superior sense; then raves to see,</L>
<L>(When contradicted,) fools less wise than he.</L>
<L>Mates with his great creator; vainly bold</L>
<L>To make new systems, or to mend the old.</L>
<L>Shapes out a deity; doubts, then denies:</L>
<L>And drunk with science, curses god and dies.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Not heav'nly wisdom, only, is with-held,</L>
<L>But the free bounty of the self-sown field:</L>
<L>No more, as erst, from nature's ready feast,</L>
<L>Rises the satisfy'd, but temp'rate guest:</L>
<L>Cast wild abroad, no happy mean preserves;</L>
<L>By choice he surfeits, by constraint he starves:</L>
<L>Toils life away upon the stubborn plain,</L>
<L>T'extort from thence the slow reluctant grain;</L>
<L>The slow reluctant grain, procur'd to-day,</L>
<L>His less industrious neighbour steals away:</L>
<L>Hence fists and clubs the village-peace confound,</L>
<L>Till sword and cannon spread the ruin round;</L>
<L>For time and art but bring from bad to worse:</L>
<L>Unequal lots succeed unequal force,</L>
<L>Each lot a several curse. Hence rich, and poor:</L>
<L>This pines, and dies neglected at the door;</L>
<L><PB N="43" REF="46"/>
While gouts and fevers wait the loaded mess,</L>
<L>And take full vengeance for the poor's distress.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No more the passions are the springs of life;</L>
<L>But seeds of vice, and elements of strife:</L>
<L>Love, social love, t' extend to all design'd,</L>
<L>Back to its fountain flows; to self, confin'd.</L>
<L>Source of misfortunes! the fond husband's wrong;</L>
<L>The maid dishonour'd, and deserted young!</L>
<L>The mischief spreads; when vengeance for the lust</L>
<L>Unpeoples realms, and calls the ruin just.</L>
<L>Hence, Troy, thy fate! the blood of thousands spilt,</L>
<L>And orphans mourning for unconscious guilt.</L>
<L>Thus love destroys, for kinder purpose giv'n;</L>
<L>And man corrupts the blessings meant by heav'n;</L>
<L>Self-injur'd, let us censure HIM no more:</L>
<L>Ambition makes us slaves, and av'rice poor.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What arts the wild disorder shall controul,</L>
<L>And render peace with virtue to the soul?</L>
<L>Out-reason interest, balance prejudice;</L>
<L>Give passion ears, and blinded error eyes?</L>
<L>Arm the weak hand with conquest, and protect</L>
<L>From guile, the heart too honest to suspect?</L>
<L>For this, mankind, by sad experience taught,</L>
<L>Again their safety in dependence sought:</L>
<L>Press'd to the standard, sued before the throne;</L>
<L>And durst rely on wisdom not their own.</L>

<HEAD>An Epistle from a SWISS OFFICER, TO HIS FRIEND at Rome.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>FROM horrid mountains ever hid in snow,</L>
<L>And barren lands, and dreary plains below;</L>
<L>To you, dear sir, my best regards I send,</L>
<L>The weakest reas'ner, as the truest friend.</L>
<L><PB N="53" REF="56"/>
Your arguments, that vainly strive to please,</L>
<L>Your arts, your country, and your palaces;</L>
<L>What signs of Roman grandeur still remain—</L>
<L>Much you have said; and much have said in vain.</L>
<L>Fine pageants these for slaves, to please the eye;</L>
<L>And put the neatest dress on misery!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Bred up to slav'ry and dissembled pain,</L>
<L>Unhappy man! you trifle with your chain:</L>
<L>But shou'd your friend with your desires comply,</L>
<L>And sell himself to Rome and slavery;</L>
<L>He could not wear his trammels with that art,</L>
<L>Or hide the noble anguish of his heart:</L>
<L>You'd soon repent the livery you gave;</L>
<L>For, trust me, I shou'd make an awkard slave.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Falsely you blame our barren rocks and plains,</L>
<L>Happy in freedom and laborious swains:</L>
<L>Our peasants chearful to the field repair,</L>
<L>And can enjoy the labours of the year;</L>
<L>Whilst yours, beneath some tree, with mournful eyes,</L>
<L>Sees for his haughty lord his harvests rise:</L>
<L>Then silent sighs; but stops his slavish breath:</L>
<L>He silent sighs; for should he speak, 'tis death.</L>
<L>Hence from our field the lazy grain we call,</L>
<L>Too much for want, for luxury too small;</L>
<L>Whilst all Campania's rich inviting soil</L>
<L>Scarce knows the plowshare, or the reaper's toil.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In arms we breed our youth. To dart from far,</L>
<L>And aim aright the thunder of the war;</L>

To whirl the faulchion, and direct the blow;</L>
<L>To ward the stroke, or bear upon the foe.</L>
<L>Early in hardships thro' the woods they fly,</L>

<L>Some prowling wolf or foamy boar to meet,</L>
<L>And stretch the panting savage at their feet:</L>
<L>Inur'd by this, they seek a nobler war,</L>
<L>And show an honest pride in ev'ry scar;</L>
<L>With joy the danger and the blood partake,</L>
<L>Whilst ev'ry wound is for their country's sake.</L>
<L>But you, soft warriors, forc'd into the field,</L>

<L>Who fights for tyrants is his country's foe.</L>

<L>Or if our scheme some interval allows,</L>
<L>Some hours design'd for thought and for repose;</L>
<L>Soon as the scatter'd images begin</L>
<L>In the mind to rally—company comes in:</L>
<L><PB N="56" REF="59"/>
Reason, adieu! there's no more room to think;</L>
<L>For all the day behind is noise and drink.</L>
<L>Thus life rolls on, but not without regret;</L>
<L>Whene'er at morning, in some cool retreat,</L>
<L>I walk alone:—'tis then in thought I view</L>
<L>Some sage of old; 'tis then I think of you:</L>
<L>Whose breast no tyrant passions ever seize,</L>
<L>No pulse that riots, blood that disobeys;</L>
<L>Who follow but where judgment points the way,</L>
<L>And whom too busy sense ne'er led astray.</L>
<L>Not that you joys with moderation shun;</L>
<L>You taste all pleasures, but indulge in none.</L>
<L>Fir'd by this image, I resolve anew:</L>

<L>Oh shield me, sapience! virtue's reign, commence!</L>
<L>Alas, how short a reign?—the walk is o'er,</L>
<L>The dinner waits, and friends some half a score:</L>
<L>At first to virtue firm, the glass I fly;</L>
<L>'Till some fly sot,—"Not drink the family!"</L>
<L>Thus gratitude is made to plead for sin;</L>
<L>My trait'rous breast a party forms within:</L>
<L>And inclination brib'd, we never want</L>
<L>Excuse—"'Tis hot, and walking makes one faint."</L>
<L>Now sense gets strength; my bright resolves decay,</L>
<L>Like stars that melt at the approach of day:</L>
<L>Thought dies; and ev'n, at last, your image fades away.</L>
<L><PB N="57" REF="60"/>
My head grows warm; all reason I despise:</L>

<L>Surely to fail, the first step is to vow.</L>

<L>The country lately, 'twas my wish: oh there!</L>
<L>Gardens, diversions, friends, relations, air:</L>
<L>For London now, dear London, how I burn!</L>
<L>I must be happy, sure, when I return.</L>
<L>Whoever hopes true happiness to see,</L>
<L>Hopes for what never was, nor e'er will be:</L>
<L>The nearest ease, since we must suffer still,</L>
<L>Are they, who dare be patient under ill.</L>

<L>Whilom a fool saw where a fiddle lay;</L>

<L>He tries in vain, 'tis discord all, and noise:</L>
<L>Fretting he threw it by: then thus the lout;</L>
<L>"There's musick in it, could I fetch it out."</L>
<L>If life does not its harmony impart,</L>
<L>We want not instruments, but have not art.</L>
<L>'Tis endless to defer our hopes of ease,</L>
<L>Till crosses end, and disappointments cease.</L>

Rapt thro' the scenes of life, he drops his prime;</L>
<L>A cripple sixty years before his time;</L>
<L>Runs in a moment all its stages o'er,</L>

<L>Now he a venerable judge appears,</L>

<L>With settled air, and most judicious face,</L>
<L>Nods o'er the cushion, council, and the case;</L>

<L>Talks of old times; commends their loyal zeal,</L>
<L>Their wholsome statutes, discipline, and ale:</L>

<L>The Thames, the streets, the king, and king's highways.</L>

<L>Bawl for his client, wrest the tortur'd laws</L>

<L>In solemn form harange the list'ning croud,</L>

<L>His frantick silence mutt'ring ere he speaks:</L>
<L>Protracted hums the solemn farce begin,</L>
<L>And groans and pauses interrupt the scene;</L>
<L>As each in just succession comes and goes,</L>
<L>Work'd to its pitch, the spirit stronger grows,</L>
<L>And squeezes out his eyes, and twangs his vocal nose.</L>
<L>Now quick and rapid, and in rage more loud,</L>
<L>A storm of nonsense bursts upon the croud:</L>
<L><PB N="68" REF="71"/>
His hand and voice proclaim the gen'ral doom,</L>
<L>While this the hour-glass shakes, and that the room.</L>
<L>On nature's ruins all his doctrines dwell,</L>
<L>And throw wide open every gate of hell.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A thousand other shapes he wears with grace;</L>
<L>A thousand more varieties of face:</L>
<L>But who, in every shape, can count him o'er,</L>
<L>Who multiplies his person every hour?</L>
<L>What muse his flying features can pursue,</L>
<L>Or keep his wand'ring countenance in view?</L>
<L>Had I a thousand mouths, a thousand tongues,</L>

<L>TOO much my heart of beauty's pow'r hath known:</L>
<L>Too long to love hath reason left the throne;</L>
<L>Too long my better genius mourn'd his chain,</L>
<L>And youth's unvalued hours consum'd in vain.</L>
<L>My wishes, lull'd with soft, inglorious dreams,</L>
<L>Forgot the patriot's and the sage's themes;</L>
<L>Thro' many a painted vale and fairy grove,</L>
<L>Thro' all th' enchanted paradise of love,</L>
<L>Misled by sickly hope's delusive flame;</L>
<L>Averse to action, and renouncing fame.</L>

<L>At length the visionary scenes decay:</L>
<L>At length my eyes confess the new-born day,</L>
<L>Whose faithful beams detect the dang'rous road</L>
<L>In which my heedless feet securely trod;</L>
<L>And strip the phantoms of their lying charms,</L>
<L>Which lur'd my soul from wisdom's peaceful arms.</L>
<L>Now for smooth streams, and banks bespread with flow'rs,</L>
<L>For myrtle walks, and amaranthine bow'rs;</L>
<L><PB N="94" REF="97"/>
Lo, barren heaths appear, and pathless woods,</L>
<L>And rocks incumbent o'er unfathom'd floods.</L>
<L>For happy smiles, for openness of heart,</L>
<L>Looks bright with love, and passion scorning art;</L>
<L>Lo, sullen spite, and cunning lust of gain,</L>
<L>And cruel pride, and insolent disdain.</L>
<L>For graceful ease, lo, affectation walks;</L>
<L>And dull half-sense for wit and wisdom talks.</L>

<L>O youth, whoe'er dost beauty's paths attend,</L>
<L>Paths which in love's perfidious mansion end,</L>
<L>O learn from me what pomp surrounds his throne:</L>
<L>For I have known the place, too well have known.</L>
<L>There burning fury heav'n and earth defies;</L>
<L>And dumb despair in icy fetters lies:</L>
<L>And black suspicion bends his gloomy brow,</L>
<L>The unblest image of himself to view;</L>
<L>And blind belief, with all a lover's flame,</L>
<L>Sinks in those arms which clothe his head with shame,</L>
<L>There wan dejection, falt'ring as he goes,</L>
<L>In shades and silence vainly seeks repose;</L>
<L>Musing thro' pathless wilds consumes the day:</L>
<L>Then, lost in darkness, weeps the hours away.</L>
<L>There the gay train of luxury advance,</L>
<L>To Lydian sounds adapting Circe's dance.</L>
<L>On every head the vernal garland glows:</L>
<L>In every hand the purple goblet flows:</L>

<L>Her mercy, with a coward's skill, to crave;</L>
<L>Bless her hard bonds, and boast to be her slave:</L>
<L>To feel for trifles a distracting train</L>

<L>Joy to my heart! my wishes are my own.</L>
<L>Farewel the female heav'n, the female hell:</L>
<L>To thee, great God of Love, a glad farewel.</L>
<L>Thy wild mis-rule at length has freed my heart;</L>
<L>And reason, passion force thee to depart.</L>
<L>—But wherefore dost thou linger on thy way?</L>
<L>Why vainly search for some pretence to stay,</L>

When crouds of vassals court thy pleasing yoke;</L>
<L>And countless victims bow them to the stroke?</L>

<L>Each vows t' assert his nymph with feats of arms,</L>
<L>Till hostile champions kneeling own her charms.</L>
<L>Ten thousand girls, with rosy chaplets crown'd,</L>
<L>To groves and streams thy tender triumph sound:</L>

<L>If nobler off'rings must thy shrine adorn,</L>

<L>I know thy puny force, thy simple wiles;</L>
<L>I break triumphant thro' thy slender toils.</L>
<L>I see thy dying lamp's last languid glow,</L>
<L>Thy arrows blunted, and unbrac'd thy bow:</L>
<L>I feel diviner fires my breast inflame,</L>
<L>For active science and ingenuous fame;</L>
<L>Resume the paths my earlier choice began,</L>
<L>And lose with pride the lover in the man.</L>

And the brisk squirrel sports from bough to bough,</L>
<L>While from an hollow oak, whose naked roots</L>
<L>O'erhang a pensive rill, the busy bees</L>
<L>Hum drowsy lullabies? The bards of old,</L>
<L>Fair nature's friends, sought such retreats, to charm</L>

<L>In bluish wreaths ascends, ripe harvests wave,</L>
<L>Low, lonely cottages, and ruin'd tops</L>
<L>Of Gothick battlements appear, and streams</L>
<L>Beneath the sun beams twinkle—the shrill lark,</L>
<L>That wakes the wood-man to his early task,</L>

Or love-sick Philomel, whose luscious lays</L>

<L>Ev'n when wild tempests swallow up the plains,</L>

<L>Daemons and goblins thro' the dark air shriek,</L>
<L>While Hecat, with her black-brow'd sisters nine,</L>
<L>Rides o'er the earth, and scatters woes and death.</L>
<L>Then too, they say, in drear Aegyptian wilds</L>
<L>The lion and the tiger prowl for prey</L>

Twinkle the streams, and woods look tip'd with gold,</L>
<L>To seek some level mead, and there invoke</L>
<L>Old midnight's sister Contemplation sage,</L>
<L>(Queen of the rugged brow, and stern-fix'd eye)</L>
<L>To lift my soul above this little earth,</L>
<L>This folly-fetter'd world; to purge my ears,</L>

<L>Clad in dun robes, an eagle on his wrist,</L>

Her flowing train, and long ambrosial hair,</L>

<L>O who will bear me then to western climes,</L>
<L>(Since Virtue leaves our wretched land) to fields</L>
<L>Yet unpolluted with Iberian swords;</L>
<L>To isles of innocence, from mortal view</L>
<L>Deeply retir'd, beneath a plantane's shade,</L>
<L>Where Happiness and Quiet sit enthron'd,</L>
<L>With simple Indian swains, that I may hunt</L>
<L>The boar and tiger thro' Savannah's wild,</L>
<L>Thro' fragrant desarts, and thro' citron-groves.</L>
<L>There fed on dates and herbs, would I despise</L>
<L>The far-fetch'd cates of Luxury, and hoards</L>
<L>Of narrow-hearted Avarice; nor heed</L>
<L>The distant din of the tumultuous world.</L>
<L>So when rude whirlwinds rouze the roaring main,</L>
<L>Beneath fair Thetis sits, in coral caves,</L>
<L>Serenely gay, nor sinking sailors cries</L>
<L>Disturb her sportive nymphs, who round her form</L>
<L>The light fantastick dance, or for her hair</L>
<L>Weave rosy crowns, or with according lutes</L>
<L>Grace the soft warbles of her honied voice.</L>

<HEAD>The Two Beavers. A FABLE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>[By the Rev. Mr. DUCK.]</BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>'TWere well, my friend, for human kind,</L>
<L>Would ev'ry man his bus'ness mind;</L>
<L>In his own orbit always move,</L>
<L>Nor blame, nor envy those above.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A Beaver, well advanc'd in age,</L>
<L>By long experience render'd sage,</L>
<L>Was skill'd in all the useful arts,</L>
<L>And justly deem'd a beast of parts;</L>
<L>Which he apply'd (as patriots shou'd)</L>
<L>In cultivating publick good.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="115" REF="118"/>
<L>This Beaver on a certain day,</L>
<L>A friendly visit went to pay</L>
<L>To a young cousin, pert and vain,</L>
<L>Who often rov'd about the plain:</L>
<L>With ev'ry idle beast conferr'd,</L>
<L>Hearing, and telling what he heard.</L>
<L>The vagrant youth was gone from home,</L>
<L>When th' ancient sage approach'd his dome;</L>
<L>Who each apartment view'd with care,</L>
<L>But found each wanted much repair.</L>
<L>The walls were crack'd, decay'd the doors,</L>
<L>The corn lay mouldy on the floors;</L>
<L>Thro' gaping crannies rush'd amain</L>
<L>The blust'ring winds with snow and rain.</L>
<L>The timber all was rotten grown,—</L>
<L>In short, the house was tumbling down.</L>
<L>The gen'rous beast, by pity sway'd,</L>
<L>Griev'd to behold it thus decay'd;</L>
<L>And while he mourn'd the tatter'd scene,</L>
<L>The master of the lodge came in.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The first congratulations o'er,</L>
<L>They rest recumbent on the floor;</L>
<L>When thus the young conceited beast</L>
<L>His thoughts impertinent express'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I long have been surpriz'd to find,</L>
<L>The lion grown so wond'rous kind</L>
<L>To one peculiar sort of beasts,</L>
<L>While he another sort detests;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="116" REF="119"/>
<L>His royal favour chiefly falls</L>
<L>Upon the species of jack-alls.</L>
<L>They share the profits of his throne,</L>
<L>He smiles on them, and them alone.</L>
<L>Mean while the ferret's useful race</L>
<L>He scarce admits to see his face;</L>
<L>Traduc'd by lies and ill report,</L>
<L>They're banish'd from his regal court,</L>
<L>And counted, over all the plain,</L>
<L>Opposers of the lion's reign.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now I conceiv'd a scheme last night,</L>
<L>Would doubtless set this matter right:</L>
<L>These parties should unite together;</L>
<L>The lion partial be to neither,</L>
<L>But let them both his favours share,</L>
<L>And both consult in peace and war.</L>
<L>This method (were this method try'd)</L>
<L>Would spread politick basis wide,</L>
<L>And on a bottom broad and strong,</L>
<L>Support the social union long—</L>
<L>But uncle, uncle, much I fear,</L>
<L>Some have abus'd the lion's ear;</L>
<L>He listens to the leopard's tongue;</L>
<L>That cursed leopard leads him wrong.</L>
<L>Were he but banish'd far away—</L>
<L>You don't attend to what I say!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Why really, couz, the sage rejoin'd,</L>
<L>The rain and snow, and driving wind,</L>
<L><PB N="117" REF="120"/>
Beat thro' with such prodigious force,</L>
<L>It made me deaf to your discourse.</L>
<L>Now, couz, were my advice pursu'd,</L>
<L>(And sure I mean it for your good)</L>
<L>Methinks you should this house repair;</L>
<L>Be this your first and chiefest care.</L>
<L>Your skill the voice of prudence calls</L>
<L>To stop these crannies in the walls,</L>
<L>And prop the roof before it falls.</L>
<L>If you this needful task perform,</L>
<L>You'll make your mansion dry and warm;</L>
<L>And we may then converse together,</L>
<L>Secure from this tempestuous weather.</L>

<HEAD>An EPISTLE from S. J. <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> in the COUNTRY, to the Right Hon. the Lord LOVELACE in TOWN.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Written in the Year 1735.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>IN days, my Lord, when mother Time,</L>
<L>Tho' now grown old, was in her prime,</L>
<L>When SATURN first began to rule,</L>
<L>And JOVE was hardly come from school,</L>
<L>How happy was a country life!</L>
<L>How free from wickedness and strife!</L>
<L>Then each man liv'd upon his farm,</L>
<L>And thought and did no mortal harm;</L>
<L>On mossy banks fair virgins slept,</L>
<L>As harmless as the flocks they kept;</L>
<L>Then love was all they had to do,</L>
<L>And nymphs were chaste, and swains were true.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But now, whatever poets write,</L>
<L>'Tis sure the case is alter'd quite,</L>
<L><PB N="126" REF="129"/>
Virtue no more in rural plains,</L>
<L>Or innocence, or peace remains;</L>
<L>But vice is in the cottage found,</L>
<L>And country girls are oft unsound;</L>
<L>Fierce party rage each village fires,</L>
<L>With wars of justices and 'squires;</L>
<L>Attorneys, for a barley straw,</L>
<L>Whole ages hamper folks in law;</L>
<L>And ev'ry neighbour's in a flame</L>
<L>About their rates, or tythes, or game:</L>
<L>Some quarrel for their hares and pigeons,</L>
<L>And some for diff'rence in religions:</L>
<L>Some hold their parson the best preacher,</L>
<L>The tinker some a better teacher;</L>
<L>These to the Church they fight for, strangers,</L>
<L>Have faith in nothing but her dangers;</L>
<L>While those, a more believing people,</L>
<L>Can swallow all things—but a steeple.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But I, my Lord, who, as you know,</L>
<L>Care little how these matters go,</L>
<L>And equally detest the strife</L>
<L>And usual joys of country life,</L>
<L>Have by good fortune little share</L>
<L>Of its diversions, or its care;</L>
<L>For seldom I with 'squires unite,</L>
<L>Who hunt all day, and drink all night;</L>
<L>Nor reckon wonderful inviting,</L>
<L>A quarter-sessions, or cock-fighting;</L>
<L><PB N="127" REF="130"/>
But then no farm I occupy,</L>
<L>With sheep to rot and cows to dye:</L>
<L>Nor rage I much, or much despair,</L>
<L>Tho' in my hedge I find a snare;</L>
<L>Nor view I, with due admiration,</L>
<L>All the high honours here in fashion;</L>
<L>The great commissions of the quorum,</L>
<L>Terrors to all who come before 'em;</L>
<L>Militia scarlet, edg'd with gold,</L>
<L>Or the white staff high-sheriffs hold;</L>
<L>The representative's caressing,</L>
<L>The judge's bow, the bishop's blessing.</L>
<L>Nor can I for my soul delight</L>
<L>In the dull feast of neighb'ring knight,</L>
<L>Who, if you send three days before,</L>
<L>In white gloves meets you at the door,</L>
<L>With superfluity of breeding</L>
<L>First makes you sick, and then with feeding.</L>
<L>Or if with ceremony cloy'd,</L>
<L>You wou'd next time such plagues avoid,</L>
<L>And visit without previous notice,</L>
<L>JOHN, JOHN, a coach!—I can't think who 'tis,</L>
<L>My lady cries, who spies your coach,</L>
<L>Ere you the avenue approach;</L>
<L>Lord, how unlucky!—Washing-day!</L>
<L>And all the men are in the hay!</L>
<L>Entrance to gain is something hard,</L>
<L>The dogs all bark, the gates are barr'd;</L>
<L><PB N="128" REF="131"/>
The yard's with lines of linnen cross'd,</L>
<L>The hall-door's lock'd, the key is lost;</L>
<L>These difficulties all o'ercome,</L>
<L>We reach at length the drawing-room,</L>
<L>Then there's such trampling over-head,</L>
<L>Madam you'd swear was brought to bed;</L>
<L>Miss in a hurry bursts her lock,</L>
<L>To get clean sleeves to hide her smock;</L>
<L>The servants run, the pewter clatters,</L>
<L>My lady dresses, calls, and chatters,</L>
<L>The cook-maid raves for want of butter,</L>
<L>Pigs squeak, fowls scream, and green geese flutter.</L>
<L>Now after three hours tedious waiting,</L>
<L>On all our neighbours faults debating,</L>
<L>And having nine times view'd the garden,</L>
<L>In which there's nothing worth a farthing,</L>
<L>In comes my lady, and the pudden:</L>
<L>You will excuse, sir,—on a sudden—</L>
<L>Then, that we may have four and four,</L>
<L>The bacon, fowls, and colly-flow'r</L>
<L>Their ancient unity divide,</L>
<L>The top one graces, one each side;</L>
<L>And by and by the second course</L>
<L>Comes lagging like a distanc'd horse;</L>
<L>A salver then to church and king,</L>
<L>The butler sweats, the glasses ring;</L>
<L>The cloth remov'd, the toasts go round,</L>
<L>Bawdy and politicks abound;</L>
<L><PB N="129" REF="132"/>
And as the knight more tipsy waxes,</L>
<L>We damn all ministers and taxes.</L>
<L>At last the ruddy sun quite sunk,</L>
<L>The coachman tolerably drunk,</L>
<L>Whirling o'er hillocks, ruts, and stones,</L>
<L>Enough to dislocate one's bones,</L>
<L>We home return, a wond'rous token</L>
<L>Of heaven's kind care, with limbs unbroken.</L>
<L>Afflict us not, ye Gods, tho' sinners,</L>
<L>With many days like this, or dinners!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But if civilities thus teaze me,</L>
<L>Nor business, nor diversions please me,</L>
<L>You'll ask, my Lord, how time I spend?</L>
<L>I answer, with a book, or friend:</L>
<L>The circulating hours dividing,</L>
<L>'Twixt reading, walking, eating, riding;</L>
<L>But books are still my highest joy,</L>
<L>These earliest please, and latest cloy.</L>
<L>Sometimes o'er distant climes I stray,</L>
<L>By guides experienc'd taught the way;</L>
<L>The wonders of each region view,</L>
<L>From frozen LAPLAND to PERU;</L>
<L>Bound o'er rough seas, and mountains bare,</L>
<L>Yet ne'er forsake my elbow chair.</L>
<L>Sometimes some fam'd historian's pen</L>
<L>Recals past ages back agen,</L>
<L>Where all I see, through every page,</L>
<L>Is but how men with senseless rage</L>
<L><PB N="130" REF="133"/>
Each other rob, destroy, and burn,</L>
<L>To serve a priest's, or statesman's turn;</L>
<L>Tho' loaded with a diff'rent aim,</L>
<L>Yet always asses much the same.</L>
<L>Sometimes I view with much delight,</L>
<L>Divines their holy game-cocks fight;</L>
<L>Here faith and works at variance set,</L>
<L>Strive hard who shall the vict'ry get;</L>
<L>Presbytery and episcopacy</L>
<L>There fight so long, it would amaze ye:</L>
<L>Here free-will holds a fierce dispute</L>
<L>With reprobation absolute;</L>
<L>There sense kicks transubstantiation,</L>
<L>And reason pecks at revelation.</L>

The atmosphere will oft perfume</L>

<L>Sometimes I pass a whole long day</L>
<L>In happy indolence away,</L>
<L>In fondly meditating o'er</L>
<L>Past pleasures, and in hoping more:</L>
<L>Or wander through the fields and woods,</L>

<L>And sparkling gems of morning dew,</L>
<L>Whence in my mind ideas rise</L>
<L>Of CAELIA's cheeks, and CHLOE's eyes.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Tis thus, my Lord, I, free from strife,</L>
<L>Spend an inglorious country life;</L>
<L>These are the joys I still pursue,</L>

<L>WHilst you, dear maid, o'er thousands born to reign,</L>

<L>The cooling breeze and ev'ning walk forsake</L>
<L>For stifling crouds, which your own beauties make;</L>
<L>Thro' circling joys while you incessant stray,</L>
<L>Charm in the mall, and sparkle at the play;</L>
<L>Think (if successive vanities can spare</L>
<L>One thought to love) what cruel pangs I bear,</L>
<L>Left in these plains all wretched, and alone,</L>
<L>To weep with fountains, and with echos groan,</L>
<L>And mourn incessantly that fatal day,</L>
<L>That all my bliss with CHLOE snatch'd away.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Say by what arts I can relieve my pain,</L>
<L>Musick, verse, all I try, but try in vain;</L>
<L>In vain the breathing flute my hand employs,</L>
<L>Late the companion of my CHLOE's voice.</L>
<L><PB N="133" REF="136"/>
Nor HANDEL's, nor CORELLI's tuneful airs</L>
<L>Can harmonize my soul, or sooth my cares;</L>
<L>Those once-lov'd med'cines unsuccessful prove,</L>
<L>Musick, alas, is but the voice of love!</L>
<L>In vain I oft harmonious lines peruse,</L>
<L>And seek for aid from POPE's and PRIOR's muse;</L>
<L>Their treach'rous numbers but assist the foe,</L>
<L>And call forth scenes of sympathising woe:</L>
<L>Here HELOISE mourns her absent lover's charms,</L>
<L>There panting EMMA sighs in HENRY's arms;</L>
<L>Their loves like mine ill-fated I bemoan,</L>
<L>And in their tender sorrows read my own.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Restless sometimes, as oft the mournful dove</L>
<L>Forsakes her nest forsaken by her love,</L>
<L>I fly from home, and seek the sacred fields,</L>
<L>Where CAM's old urn its silver current yields,</L>
<L>Where solemn tow'rs o'er-look each mossy grove,</L>
<L>As if to guard it from th' assaults of love;</L>
<L>Yet guard in vain, for there my CHLOE's eyes</L>
<L>But lately made whole colleges her prize;</L>
<L>Her sons, tho' few, not PALLAS cou'd defend,</L>
<L>Nor DULLNESS succour to her thousands lend;</L>
<L>Love like a fever with infectious rage</L>
<L>Scorch'd up the young, and thaw'd the frost of age;</L>
<L>To gaze at her, ev'n DONS were seen to run,</L>
<L>And leave unfinish'd pipes, and authors—scarce begun.</L>
<L>So HELEN look'd, and mov'd with such a grace,</L>
<L>When the grave seniors of the TROJAN race</L>
<L><PB N="134" REF="137"/>
Were forc'd those fatal beauties to admire,</L>
<L>That all their youth consum'd, and set their town on fire.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>At fam'd NEWMARKET oft I spend the day,</L>
<L>An unconcern'd spectator of the play;</L>
<L>There pitiless observe the ruin'd heir</L>
<L>With anger fir'd, or melting with despair:</L>
<L>For how shou'd I his trivial loss bemoan,</L>
<L>Who feel one, so much greater, of my own?</L>
<L>There while the golden heaps, a glorious prize,</L>
<L>Wait the decision of two rival dice,</L>
<L>Whilst long disputes 'twixt <HI>seven</HI> and <HI>five</HI> remain,</L>
<L>And each, like parties, have their friends for gain,</L>
<L>Without one wish I see the guineas shine,</L>
<L>Fate, keep your gold, I cry, make CHLOE mine.</L>
<L>Now see, prepar'd their utmost speed to try,</L>
<L>O'er the smooth turf the bounding racers fly!</L>
<L>Now more and more their slender limbs they strain,</L>
<L>And foaming stretch along the velvet plain!</L>
<L>Ah stay! swift steeds, your rapid flight delay,</L>
<L>No more the jockey's smarting lash obey:</L>
<L>But rather let my hand direct the rein,</L>
<L>And guide your steps a nobler prize to gain:</L>
<L>Then swift as eagles cut the yielding air,</L>
<L>Bear me, oh bear me to the absent fair.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now when the winds are hush'd, the air serene,</L>
<L>And chearful sun-beams gild the beauteous scene,</L>
<L>Pensive o'er all the neighb'ring fields I stray,</L>
<L>Where-e'er or choice, or chance directs the way;</L>
<L><PB N="135" REF="138"/>
Or view the op'ning lawns, or private woods,</L>
<L>Or distant bluish hills, or silver floods:</L>
<L>Now harmless birds in silken nets insnare,</L>
<L>Now with swift dogs pursue the flying hare,</L>
<L>Dull sports! for oh my CHLOE is not there!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Fatigued at length I willingly retire</L>
<L>To a small study, and a chearful fire,</L>
<L>There o'er some folio pore, I pore 'tis true,</L>
<L>But oh my thoughts are fled, and fled to you;</L>
<L>I hear you, see you, feast upon your eyes,</L>
<L>And clasp with eager arms the lovely prize.</L>
<L>Here for a while I cou'd forget my pain,</L>
<L>Whilst I by dear reflection live again;</L>
<L>But ev'n these joys are too sublime to last,</L>
<L>And quickly fade, like all the real ones past:</L>
<L>For just when now beneath some silent grove</L>
<L>I hear you talk—and talk perhaps of love,</L>
<L>Or charm with thrilling notes the list'ning ear,</L>
<L>Sweeter than angels sing, or angels hear,</L>
<L>My treach'rous hand its weighty charge lets go,</L>
<L>The book falls thund'ring on the floor below,</L>
<L>The pleasing vision in a moment's gone,</L>
<L>And I once more am wretched and alone.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So when glad ORPHEUS from th' infernal shade</L>
<L>Had just recall'd his long lamented maid,</L>
<L>Soon as her charms had reach'd his eager eyes,</L>
<L>Lost in eternal night—again she dies.</L>

<L>I teach; be present, all ye sacred Choir,</L>
<L>Blow the soft flute, and strike the sounding lyre;</L>
<L>When FIELDING bids, your kind assistance bring,</L>
<L>And at her feet the lowly tribute fling;</L>
<L><PB N="145" REF="148"/>
Oh may her eyes (to her this verse is due)</L>
<L>What first themselves inspir'd, vouchsafe to view!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Hail loveliest art! that can'st all hearts insnare,</L>
<L>And make the fairest still appear more fair.</L>
<L>Beauty can little execution do,</L>
<L>Unless she borrows half her arms from you;</L>
<L>Few, like PYGMALION, doat on lifeless charms,</L>
<L>Or care to clasp a statue in their arms;</L>
<L>But breasts of flint must melt with fierce desire,</L>
<L>When art and motion wake the sleeping fire:</L>
<L>A Venus, drawn by great Apelles' hand,</L>
<L>May for a while our wond'ring eyes command,</L>
<L>But still, tho' form'd with all the pow'rs of art,</L>
<L>The lifeless piece can never warm the heart;</L>
<L>So a fair nymph, perhaps, may please the eye,</L>
<L>Whilst all her beauteous limbs unactive lie,</L>
<L>But when her charms are in the dance display'd,</L>
<L>Then ev'ry heart adores the lovely maid:</L>
<L>This sets her beauty in the fairest light,</L>
<L>And shews each grace in full perfection bright;</L>
<L>Then, as she turns around, from ev'ry part,</L>
<L>Like porcupines she sends a piercing dart;</L>
<L>In vain, alas! the fond spectator tries</L>
<L>To shun the pleasing dangers of her eyes,</L>
<L>For, Parthian-like, she wounds as sure behind,</L>
<L>With flowing curls, and ivory neck reclin'd:</L>
<L>Whether her steps the Minuet's mazes trace,</L>
<L>Or the slow Louvre's more majestick pace,</L>
<L><PB N="146" REF="149"/>
Whether the Rigadoon employs her care,</L>
<L>Or sprightly Jigg displays the nimble fair,</L>
<L>At every step new beauties we explore,</L>
<L>And worship now, what we admir'd before:</L>
<L>So when Aeneas, in the Tyrian grove,</L>
<L>Fair Venus met, the charming queen of Love,</L>
<L>The beauteous Goddess, whilst unmov'd she stood,</L>
<L>Seem'd some fair nymph, the guardian of the wood;</L>
<L>But when she mov'd, at once her heav'nly mien,</L>
<L>And graceful step confess bright Beauty's queen,</L>
<L>New glories o'er her form each moment rise,</L>
<L>And all the Goddess opens to his eyes.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now haste, my Muse, pursue thy destin'd way,</L>
<L>What dresses best become the dancer, say,</L>
<L>The rules of dress forget not to impart,</L>
<L>A lesson previous to the dancing art.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The soldier's scarlet glowing from afar,</L>
<L>Shews that his bloody occupation's war;</L>
<L>Whilst the lawn band, beneath a double chin,</L>
<L>As plainly speaks divinity within;</L>
<L>The milk-maid safe thro' driving rains and snows,</L>
<L>Wrapp'd in her cloak, and prop'd on pattens goes;</L>
<L>While the soft Belle, immur'd in velvet chair,</L>
<L>Needs but the silken shoe, and trusts her bosom bare:</L>
<L>The woolly drab, and English broad-cloth warm,</L>
<L>Guard well the horseman from the beating storm,</L>
<L>But load the dancer with too great a weight,</L>
<L>And call from ev'ry pore the dewy sweat;</L>
<L><PB N="147" REF="150"/>
Rather let him his active limbs display</L>
<L>In camblet thin, or glossy paduasoy,</L>
<L>Let no unwieldy pride his shoulders press,</L>
<L>But airy, light, and easy be his dress;</L>
<L>Thin be his yielding soal, and low his heel,</L>
<L>So shall he nimbly bound, and safely wheel.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But let not precepts known my verse prolong,</L>
<L>Precepts which use will better teach, than song;</L>
<L>For why should I the gallant spark command,</L>
<L>With clean white gloves to fit his ready hand?</L>
<L>Or in his fobb enlivening spirits wear,</L>
<L>And pungent salts to raise the fainting fair?</L>
<L>Or hint, the sword that dangles at his side,</L>
<L>Should from its silken bondage be unty'd?</L>
<L>Why should my lays the youthful tribe advise,</L>
<L>Lest snowy clouds from out their wigs arise:</L>
<L>So shall their partners mourn their laces spoil'd,</L>
<L>And shining silks with greasy powder soil'd?</L>
<L>Nor need I, sure, bid prudent youths beware,</L>
<L>Lest with erected tongues their buckles stare,</L>
<L>The pointed steel shall oft their stocking rend,</L>
<L>And oft th' approaching petticoat offend.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And now, ye youthful fair, I sing to you,</L>
<L>With pleasing smiles my useful labours view;</L>
<L>For you the silkworms fine-wrought webs display,</L>
<L>And lab'ring spin their little lives away,</L>
<L>For you bright gems with radiant colours glow,</L>
<L>Fair as the dies that paint the heav'nly bow,</L>
<L><PB N="148" REF="151"/>
For you the sea resigns its pearly store,</L>
<L>And earth unlocks her mines of treasur'd ore;</L>
<L>In vain yet Nature thus her gifts bestows,</L>
<L>Unless yourselves with art those gifts dispose.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet think not, Nymphs, that in the glitt'ring ball,</L>
<L>One form of dress prescrib'd can suit with all;</L>
<L>One brightest shines when wealth and art combine,</L>
<L>To make the finish'd piece compleatly fine;</L>
<L>When least adorn'd, another steals our hearts,</L>
<L>And rich in native beauties, wants not arts;</L>
<L>In some are such resistless graces found,</L>
<L>That in all dresses they are sure to wound;</L>
<L>Their perfect forms all foreign aids despise,</L>
<L>And gems but borrow lustre from their eyes.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Let the fair Nymph, in whose plump cheeks is seen</L>
<L>A constant blush, be clad in chearful green;</L>
<L>In such a dress the sportive sea-nymphs go;</L>
<L>So in their grassy bed fresh roses blow:</L>
<L>The lass whose skin is like the hazle brown,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>But far from you be all those treach'rous arts,</L>
<L>That wound with painted charms unwary hearts,</L>
<L>Dancing's a touchstone that true beauty tries,</L>
<L>Nor suffers charms that nature's hand denies:</L>
<L><PB N="149" REF="152"/>
Tho' for a while we may with wonder view</L>
<L>The rosy blush, and skin of lovely hue,</L>
<L>Yet soon the dance will cause the cheeks to glow,</L>
<L>And melt the waxen lips, and neck of snow:</L>
<L>So shine the fields in icy fetters bound,</L>
<L>Whilst frozen gems bespangle all the ground,</L>
<L>Thro' the clear crystal of the glitt'ring snow,</L>
<L>With scarlet dye the blushing hawthorns glow;</L>
<L>O'er all the plains unnumber'd glories rise,</L>
<L>And a new bright creation charms our eyes;</L>
<L>Till Zephyr breathes, then all at once decay</L>
<L>The splendid scenes, their glories fade away,</L>
<L>The fields resign the beauties not their own,</L>
<L>And all their snowy charms run trickling down.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Dare I in such momentous points advise,</L>
<L>I should condemn the hoop's enormous size,</L>
<L>Of ills I speak by long experience found,</L>
<L>Oft' have I trod th' immeasurable round,</L>
<L>And mourn'd my shins bruis'd black with many a wound.</L>
<L>Nor shou'd the tighten'd stays, too straitly lac'd,</L>
<L>In whale-bone bondage gall the slender waist;</L>
<L>Nor waving lappets shou'd the dancing fair,</L>
<L>Nor ruffles edg'd with dangling fringes wear;</L>
<L>Oft will the cobweb ornaments catch hold</L>
<L>On the approaching button rough with gold,</L>
<L>Nor force, nor art can then the bonds divide,</L>
<L>When once th' intangled Gordian knot is ty'd.</L>
<L><PB N="150" REF="153"/>
So the unhappy pair, by Hymen's pow'r</L>
<L>Together join'd in some ill-fated hour,</L>
<L>The more they strive their freedom to regain,</L>
<L>The faster binds th' indissoluble chain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Let each fair maid, who fears to be disgrac'd,</L>
<L>Ever be sure to tye her garters fast,</L>
<L>Lest the loos'd string, amidst the publick ball,</L>
<L>A wish'd for prize to some proud fop should fall,</L>

<L>But yet, (as fortune by the self-same ways</L>
<L>She humbles many, some delights to raise)</L>
<L>It happen'd once, a fair illustrious dame</L>
<L>By such neglect acquir'd immortal fame.</L>
<L>And hence the radiant Star and Garter blue</L>
<L>BRITANNIA's nobles grace, if Fame says true:</L>

<L>A wond'rous engine, that by magick charms,</L>
<L>Cools your own breasts, and ev'ry other's warms.</L>

What verse can e'er explain it's various parts,</L>
<L>Its num'rous uses, motions, charms and arts?</L>
<L>Its painted folds, that oft extended wide,</L>
<L>Th' afflicted fair one's blubber'd beauties hide,</L>
<L>When secret sorrows her sad bosom fill,</L>
<L>If STREPHON is unkind, or SHOCK is ill:</L>
<L>Its sticks, on which her eyes dejected pore,</L>
<L>And pointing fingers number o'er and o'er,</L>
<L>When the kind virgin burns with secret shame,</L>

<L>Once in Arcadia, that fam'd seat of love,</L>
<L>There liv'd a nymph the pride of all the grove,</L>
<L>A lovely nymph, adorn'd with ev'ry grace,</L>
<L>An easy shape, and sweetly-blooming face,</L>
<L>FANNY the damsel's name, as chaste as fair,</L>
<L>Each virgin's envy, and each swain's despair,</L>
<L>To charm her ear the rival shepherds sing,</L>
<L>Blow the soft flute, and wake the trembling string,</L>
<L>For her they leave their wand'ring flocks to rove,</L>
<L>Whilst FANNY's name resounds thro' ev'ry grove,</L>
<L>And spreads on ev'ry tree, inclos'd in knots of love;</L>
<L><PB N="152" REF="155"/>
As FIELDING's now, her eyes all hearts inflame,</L>
<L>Like her in beauty, as alike in name.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Twas when the summer sun, now mounted high,</L>
<L>With fiercer beams had scorch'd the glowing sky,</L>
<L>Beneath the covert of a cooling shade,</L>
<L>To shun the heat, this lovely nymph was lay'd;</L>
<L>The sultry weather o'er her cheeks had spread</L>
<L>A blush, that added to their native red,</L>
<L>And her fair breast, as polish'd marble white,</L>
<L>Was half conceal'd, and half expos'd to sight:</L>
<L>AEOLUS the mighty God, whom winds obey,</L>
<L>Observ'd the beauteous maid, as thus she lay,</L>
<L>O'er all her charms he gaz'd with fond delight,</L>
<L>And suck'd in poison at the dang'rous sight,</L>
<L>He sighs, he burns; at last declares his pain,</L>
<L>But still he sighs, and still he wooes in vain;</L>
<L>The cruel nymph, regardless of his moan,</L>
<L>Minds not his flame, uneasy with her own;</L>
<L>But still complains, that he who rul'd the air</L>
<L>Wou'd not command one Zephyr to repair</L>
<L>Around her face, nor gentle breeze to play</L>
<L>Thro' the dark glade, to cool the sultry day;</L>
<L>By love incited, and the hopes of joy,</L>
<L>Th' ingenious God contriv'd this pretty toy,</L>

<L>Their sparkling beams, that still more brightly glow,</L>
<L>Reflected back from gems, and eyes below:</L>

<L>Long was the dancing art unfix'd, and free,</L>
<L>Hence lost in error, and uncertainty,</L>
<L>No precepts did it mind, or rules obey,</L>
<L>But ev'ry master taught a diff'rent way;</L>

<L>Wise Nature ever, with a prudent hand,</L>

<L>Lands unexplor'd, and sail'd the globe around:</L>
<L>But none will sure presume to rival FRANCE,</L>
<L>Whether she forms, or executes the dance;</L>
<L>To her exalted genius 'tis we owe</L>
<L>The sprightly Rigadoon and Louvre slow,</L>
<L>The Borée, and Courant unpractis'd long,</L>
<L>Th' immortal Minuet, and the smooth Bretagne,</L>

<L><NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">French dances.</NOTE> That from their native country take their name,</L>
<L>With these let ev'ry ball be first begun,</L>
<L>Nor country-dance intrude 'till these are done.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Each cautious bard, ere he attempts to sing,</L>
<L>First gently flutt'ring trys his tender wing,</L>
<L><PB N="156" REF="159"/>
And if he finds that with uncommon fire</L>
<L>The Muses all his raptur'd soul inspire,</L>
<L>At once to heav'n he soars in lofty odes,</L>
<L>And sings alone of heroes and of gods;</L>
<L>But if he trembling fears a flight so high,</L>
<L>He then descends to softer elegy,</L>
<L>And if in elegy he can't succeed,</L>
<L>In past'ral he may tune the oaten reed:</L>
<L>So shou'd the dancer, ere he tries to move,</L>
<L>With care his strength, his weight, and genius prove;</L>
<L>Then, if he finds kind nature's gifts impart</L>
<L>Endowments proper for the dancing art,</L>
<L>If in himself he feels together join'd,</L>
<L>An active body and ambitious mind,</L>
<L>In nimble Rigadoons he may advance,</L>
<L>Or in the Louvre's slow majestick dance;</L>
<L>If these he fears to reach, with easy pace</L>
<L>Let him the Minuet's circling mazes trace:</L>
<L>Is this too hard? this too let him forbear,</L>
<L>And to the Country-dance confine his care.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Wou'd you in dancing ev'ry fault avoid,</L>
<L>To keep true time be your first thoughts employ'd;</L>
<L>All other errors they in vain shall mend,</L>
<L>Who in this one important point offend;</L>
<L>For this, when now united hand in hand</L>

<L>Let them a while their nimble feet restrain,</L>
<L>And with soft taps beat time to ev'ry strain:</L>
<L><PB N="157" REF="160"/>
So for the race prepar'd two coursers stand,</L>
<L>And with impatient pawings spurn the sand.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In vain a master shall employ his care,</L>
<L>Where nature once has fix'd a clumsy air;</L>
<L>Rather let such, to country sports confin'd,</L>
<L>Pursue the flying hare, or tim'rous hind:</L>
<L>Nor yet, while I the rural squire despise,</L>
<L>A mien effeminate wou'd I advise;</L>
<L>With equal scorn I wou'd the fop deride,</L>
<L>Nor let him dance,—but on the woman's side.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And you, fair nymphs, avoid with equal care,</L>
<L>A stupid dullness, and a coquet air,</L>
<L>Neither with eyes, that ever love the ground,</L>
<L>Asleep, like spinning tops, run round and round,</L>
<L>Nor yet with giddy looks, and wanton pride,</L>
<L>Stare all around, and skip srom side to side.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>True dancing, like true wit, is best express'd</L>
<L>By nature only to advantage dress'd;</L>
<L>'Tis not a nimble bound, or caper high,</L>

<L>'Tis not enough, that ev'ry stander-by</L>
<L>No glaring errors in your steps can spy,</L>
<L>The dance and musick must so nicely meet,</L>
<L>Each note shou'd seem an echo to your feet;</L>
<L>A nameless grace must in each movement dwell,</L>
<L>Which words can ne'er express, or precepts tell,</L>
<L><PB N="158" REF="161"/>
Not to be taught, but ever to be seen</L>
<L>In FLAVIA's air, and CHLOE's easy mien:</L>
<L>'Tis such an air that makes her thousands fall,</L>
<L>When FIELDING dances at a birth-night ball;</L>
<L>Smooth as CAMILLA she skims o'er the plain,</L>
<L>And flys like her thro' crouds of heroes slain.</L>

<L>(Like all terrestrial joys) can please no more,</L>
<L>And ev'ry nymph, refusing to expand</L>

<L>Then let the jovial country-dance begin,</L>
<L>And the loud fiddles call each straggler in:</L>
<L>But ere they come, permit me to disclose,</L>
<L>How first, as legends tell, this pastime rose.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In ancient times (such times are now no more)</L>
<L>When Albion's crown illustrious ARTHUR wore,</L>
<L>In some fair-op'ning glade, each summer's night,</L>
<L>Where the pale moon diffus'd her silver light,</L>
<L>On the soft carpet of a grassy field,</L>
<L>The sporting fairies their assemblies held:</L>
<L>Some lightly tripping with their pygmy queen,</L>
<L>In circling ringlets mark'd the level green,</L>
<L>Some with soft notes bade mellow pipes resound,</L>
<L>And musick warble thro' the groves around,</L>
<L>Oft lonely shepherds by the forest side,</L>
<L>Belated peasants oft their revels spy'd,</L>
<L>And home returning, o'er the nut-brown ale,</L>
<L>Their guests diverted with the wond'rous tale.</L>
<L><PB N="159" REF="162"/>
Instructed hence, throughout the British isle,</L>
<L>And fond to imitate the pleasing toil,</L>
<L>Round where the trembling may pole's fix'd on high,</L>
<L>And bears its flow'ry honours to the sky</L>
<L>The ruddy maids, and sun-burn'd swains resort,</L>
<L>And practise ev'ry night the lovely sport;</L>
<L>On ev'ry side Aeolian artists stand,</L>
<L>Whose active elbows swelling winds command,</L>
<L>The swelling winds harmonious pipes inspire,</L>
<L>And blow in ev'ry breast a gen'rous fire.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus taught at first the country-dance began,</L>
<L>And hence to cities and to courts it ran,</L>
<L>Succeeding ages did in time impart</L>
<L>Various improvements to the lovely art;</L>
<L>From fields and groves to palaces remov'd,</L>
<L>Great ones the pleasing exercise approv'd;</L>
<L>Hence the loud fiddle, and shrill trumpet's sounds</L>
<L>Are made companions of the dancer's bounds,</L>
<L>Hence gems, and silks, brocades, and ribbons join,</L>
<L>To make the ball with perfect lustre shine.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So rude at first the tragick muse appear'd,</L>
<L>Her voice alone by rustick rabble heard,</L>
<L>Where twisting trees a cooling arbour made,</L>
<L>The pleas'd spectators sate beneath the shade;</L>
<L>The homely stage with rushes green was strew'd,</L>
<L>And in a cart the stroling actors rode:</L>
<L>Till time at length improv'd the great design,</L>
<L>And bade the scenes with painted landskips shine;</L>
<L><PB N="160" REF="163"/>
Then art did all the bright machines dispose,</L>
<L>And theatres of Parian marble rose,</L>
<L>Then mimick thunder shook the canvass sky,</L>
<L>And Gods descended from their tow'rs on high.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With caution now let ev'ry youth prepare</L>
<L>To chuse a partner from the mingled fair;</L>
<L>Vain wou'd be here th' instructing muse's voice,</L>
<L>If she pretended to direct his choice:</L>
<L>Beauty alone by fancy is express'd,</L>
<L>And charms in diff'rent forms each different breast;</L>
<L>A snowy skin this am'rous youth admires,</L>
<L>Whilst nut-brown cheeks another's bosom fires,</L>
<L>Small waists and slender limbs some hearts insnare,</L>
<L>While others love the more substantial fair.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But let not outward charms your judgments sway,</L>
<L>Your reason rather than your eyes obey,</L>
<L>And in the dance as in the marriage noose,</L>
<L>Rather for merit, than for beauty, choose:</L>
<L>Be her your choice, who knows with perfect skill</L>
<L>When she shou'd move, and when she shou'd be still,</L>
<L>Who uninstructed can perform her share,</L>
<L>And kindly half the pleasing burthen bear.</L>
<L>Unhappy is that hopeless wretch's fate,</L>
<L>Who fetter'd in the matrimonial state</L>
<L>With a poor, simple, unexperienc'd wife,</L>
<L>Is forc'd to lead the tedious dance of life;</L>
<L>And such is his, with such a partner join'd,</L>
<L>A moving puppet, but without a mind:</L>
<L><PB N="161" REF="164"/>
Still must his hand be pointing out the way,</L>
<L>Yet ne'er can teach so fast, as she can stray,</L>
<L>Beneath her follies he must ever groan,</L>
<L>And ever blush for errors not his own.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But now behold united hand in hand,</L>
<L>Rang'd on each side, the well-pair'd couples stand!</L>
<L>Each youthful bosom beating with delight,</L>
<L>Waits the brisk signal for the pleasing fight;</L>
<L>While lovely eyes, that flash unusual rays,</L>
<L>And snowy bubbies pull'd above the stays,</L>
<L>Quick busy hands, and bridling heads declare</L>
<L>The fond impatience of the starting fair.</L>
<L>And see, the sprightly dance is now begun!</L>
<L>Now here, now there the giddy maze they run,</L>
<L>Now with slow steps they pace the circling ring,</L>
<L>Now all confus'd, too swift for sight they spring:</L>
<L>So, in a wheel with rapid fury toss'd,</L>
<L>The undistinguish'd spokes are in the motion lost.</L>

<L>The dancer here no more requires a guide,</L>
<L>To no strict steps his nimble feet are ty'd,</L>
<L>The muse's precepts here wou'd useless be,</L>
<L>Where all is fancy'd, unconsin'd, and free;</L>
<L>Let him but to the musick's voice attend,</L>
<L>By this instructed, he can ne'er offend;</L>
<L>If to his share it falls the dance to lead,</L>
<L>In well-known paths he may be sure to tread;</L>
<L>If others lead, let him their motions view,</L>
<L>And in their steps the winding maze pursue.</L>

<L>In ev'ry Country-dance a serious mind,</L>
<L>Turn'd for reflexion, can a moral find,</L>
<L>In Hunt-the-Squirrel thus the nymph we view,</L>
<L>Seeks when we fly, but flies when we pursue:</L>
<L>Thus in Round-dances, where our partners change,</L>
<L>And unconfin'd from fair to fair we range,</L>
<L>As soon as one from his own consort flies,</L>
<L>Another seizes on the lovely prize:</L>
<L>A while the fav'rite youth enjoys her charms,</L>
<L>Till the next comer steals her from his arms,</L>
<L>New ones succeed, the last is still her care;</L>
<L>How true an emblem of th' inconstant fair!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Where can philosophers, and sages wise,</L>
<L>Who read the curious volumes of the skies,</L>
<L>A model more exact than dancing name,</L>
<L>Of the creation's universal frame?</L>
<L>Where worlds unnumber'd o'er th' aetherial way,</L>
<L>In a bright regular confusion stray;</L>
<L>Now here, now there they whirl along the sky,</L>
<L>Now near approach, and now far distant fly,</L>
<L>Now meet in the same order they begun,</L>
<L>And then the great coelestial dance is done.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Where can the Mor'list find a juster plan</L>
<L>Of the vain labours, and the life of man?</L>
<L>A while thro' justling crouds we toil, and sweat,</L>
<L>And eagerly pursue we know not what,</L>
<L>Then when our trifling short-liv'd race is run,</L>
<L>Quite tir'd sit down, just where we first begun.</L>

<L>There rest a while: there snatch the fleeting bliss,</L>

<L>Each secret wish, each softer hope confess,</L>
<L>And her moist palm with eager fingers press;</L>
<L>With smiles the fair shall hear your warm desires,</L>

Around her shoulders let this arm be cast,</L>
<L>Whilst that from cold defends her slender waist;</L>
<L>With kisses warm her balmy lips shall glow,</L>
<L>Unchill'd by nightly damps, or wintry snow,</L>
<L>While gen'rous white-wine, mull'd with ginger warm,</L>

<L>The muse has play'd the kind instructor's part,</L>

<L>No more remains; no more the goddess sings,</L>

<L>On downy beds the weary'd dancers lie,</L>
<L>And sleep's silk cords tie down each drowsy eye;</L>
<L>Delightful dreams their pleasing sports restore,</L>
<L>And ev'n in sleep they seem to dance once more.</L>

<L>And now the work compleatly finish'd lies,</L>
<L>Which the devouring teeth of time defies;</L>
<L>Whilst birds in air, or fish in streams we find,</L>

As long as nymphs shall with attentive ear</L>
<L>A fiddle rather than a sermon hear:</L>

<L>Expert in Latin, more expert in taw,</L>
<L>His honour posts o'er ITALY and FRANCE,</L>
<L>Measures St. PETER's dome, and learns to dance.</L>
<L>Thence, having quick thro' various countries flown,</L>
<L>Glean'd all their follies, and expos'd his own,</L>
<L>He back returns, a thing so strange all o'er,</L>
<L>As never ages past produc'd before:</L>
<L><PB N="166" REF="169"/>
A monster of such complicated worth,</L>
<L>As no one single clime could e'er bring forth:</L>
<L>Half atheist, papist, gamester, bubble, rook,</L>
<L>Half fiddler, coachman, dancer, groom, and cook.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Next, because bus'ness now is all the vogue,</L>
<L>And who'd be quite polite must be a rogue,</L>
<L>In parliament he purchases a seat,</L>
<L>To make th' accomplish'd gentleman compleat.</L>
<L>There safe in self-sufficient impudence,</L>
<L>Without experience, honesty, or sense,</L>
<L>Unknowing in her int'rest, trade, or laws,</L>
<L>He vainly undertakes his country's cause:</L>
<L>Forth from his lips, prepar'd at all to rail,</L>
<L>Torrents of nonsense burst; like bottled ale,</L>
<L>Tho' shallow, muddy; brisk, tho' mighty dull;</L>
<L>Fierce without strength; o'erflowing, tho' not full.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now quite a Frenchman in his garb and air,</L>
<L>His neck yok'd down with bag and solitaire,</L>
<L>The liberties of BRITAIN he supports,</L>
<L>And storms at place-men, ministers, and courts;</L>
<L>Now in crop'd greasy hair, and leather breeches,</L>
<L>He loudly bellows out his patriot speeches:</L>
<L>King, lords, and commons ventures to abuse,</L>
<L>Yet dares to shew those ears, he ought to lose.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>From hence to WHITE's our virtuous CATO flies,</L>
<L>There sits with countenance erect, and wise,</L>
<L>And talks of games of whist, and pig-tail pies.</L>

Plays all the night, nor doubts each law to break,</L>
<L>Himself unknowingly has help'd to make;</L>
<L>Trembling and anxious, stakes his utmost groat,</L>
<L>Peeps o'er his cards, and looks as if he thought:</L>
<L>Next morn disowns the losses of the night,</L>
<L>Because the fool would fain be thought a bite.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Devoted thus to politicks, and cards,</L>
<L>Nor mirth, nor wine, nor women he regards,</L>
<L>So far is ev'ry virtue from his heart,</L>
<L>That not a gen'rous vice can claim a part;</L>
<L>Nay, lest one human passion e'er should move</L>
<L>His soul to friendship, tenderness, or love,</L>
<L>To FIGG and BROUGHTON he commits his breast,</L>
<L>To steel it to the fashionable test.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus poor in wealth, he labours to no end,</L>
<L>Wretched alone, in crouds without a friend;</L>
<L>Insensible to all that's good, or kind,</L>
<L>Deaf to all merit, to all beauty blind;</L>
<L>For love too busy, and for wit too grave,</L>
<L>A harden'd, sober, proud, luxurious knave,</L>
<L>By little actions striving to be great,</L>
<L>And proud to be, and to be thought a cheat.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And yet in this so bad is his success,</L>
<L>That as his fame improves, his rents grow less;</L>
<L>On parchment wings his acres take their flight,</L>
<L>And his unpeopled groves admit the light;</L>
<L>With his estate his int'rest too is done,</L>
<L>His honest borough seeks a warmer sun,</L>
<L><PB N="168" REF="171"/>
For him, now cash and liquor flows no more,</L>
<L>His independent voters cease to roar:</L>

<L>Marries some jointer'd antiquated crone:</L>
<L>And boldly, when his country is at stake,</L>
<L>Braves the deep yawning gulph, like CURTIUS, for its sake.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Quickly again distress'd for want of coin,</L>
<L>He digs no longer in th' exhausted mine,</L>
<L>But seeks preferment, as the last resort,</L>
<L>Cringes each morn at levées, bows at court,</L>
<L>And, from the hand he hates, implores support:</L>
<L>The minister, well pleas'd at small expence</L>
<L>To silence so much rude impertinence,</L>
<L>With squeeze and whisper yields to his demands,</L>
<L>And on the venal list enroll'd he stands,</L>
<L>A ribband and a pension buy the slave,</L>
<L>This bribes the fool about him, that the knave.</L>
<L>And now arriv'd at his meridian glory,</L>
<L>He sinks apace, despis'd by Whig and Tory;</L>
<L>Of independence now he talks no more,</L>
<L>Nor shakes the senate with his patriot roar,</L>
<L>But silent votes, and with court trappings hung,</L>
<L>Eyes his own glitt'ring star, and holds his tongue.</L>
<L>In craft political a bankrupt made,</L>
<L>He sticks to gaming, as the surer trade;</L>
<L><PB N="169" REF="172"/>
Turns downright sharper, lives by sucking blood,</L>
<L>And grows, in short, the very thing he wou'd:</L>
<L>Hunts out young heirs, who have their fortunes spent,</L>
<L>And lends them ready cash at cent per cent,</L>
<L>Lays wagers on his own, and others lives,</L>
<L>Fights uncles, fathers, grandmothers, and wives,</L>
<L>Till death at length, indignant to be made</L>
<L>The daily subject of his sport and trade,</L>
<L>Veils with his sable hand the wretch's eyes,</L>
<L>And, groaning for the betts he loses by't, he dies.</L>

<L>THOU, whom nor honours, wealth, nor youth can spoil</L>
<L>With the least vice of each luxuriant soil,</L>
<L>Say, YORKE, (for sure, if any, thou canst tell)</L>
<L>What Virtue is, who practise it so well;</L>
<L>Say, where inhabits this Sultana queen;</L>
<L>Prais'd and ador'd by all, but rarely seen:</L>
<L>By what sure marks her essence can we trace,</L>
<L>When each religion, faction, age, and place</L>
<L><PB N="170" REF="173"/>
Sets up some fancy'd idol of its own,</L>
<L>A vain pretender to her sacred throne?</L>
<L>In man, too oft a well-dissembled part,</L>
<L>A self-denying pride in woman's heart,</L>
<L>In synods faith, and in the fields of fame</L>
<L>Valour usurps her honours, and her name.</L>
<L>Whoe'er their sense of virtue wou'd express,</L>
<L>'Tis still by something they themselves possess.</L>
<L>Hence youth good-humour, frugal craft old-age,</L>
<L>Warm politicians term it party-rage,</L>
<L>True churchmen zeal right orthodox; and hence</L>
<L>Fools think it gravity, and wits pretence;</L>
<L>To constancy alone fond lovers join it,</L>
<L>And maids unask'd to chastity confine it.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But have we then no law besides our will?</L>
<L>No just criterion fix'd to good and ill?</L>
<L>As well at noon we may obstruct our sight,</L>
<L>Then doubt if such a thing exists as light;</L>
<L>For no less plain wou'd nature's law appear,</L>
<L>As the meridian sun unchang'd, and clear,</L>
<L>Wou'd we but search for what we were design'd,</L>
<L>And for what end th'Almighty form'd mankind,</L>
<L>A rule of life we then shou'd plainly see,</L>
<L>For to pursue that end must Virtue be.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then what is that? not want of pow'r, or fame,</L>
<L>Or worlds unnumber'd to applaud his name,</L>
<L>But a desire his blessings to diffuse,</L>
<L>And fear lest millions shou'd exisstence lose;</L>
<L><PB N="171" REF="174"/>
His goodness only cou'd his pow'r employ,</L>
<L>And an eternal warmth to propagate his joy.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Hence soul, and sense diffus'd thro' ev'ry place</L>
<L>Make happiness as infinite as space;</L>
<L>Thousands of suns beyond each other blaze,</L>
<L>Orbs roll o'er orbs, and glow with mutual rays;</L>
<L>Each is a world, where form'd with wond'rous art</L>
<L>Unnumber'd species live thro' ev'ry part:</L>
<L>In ev'ry tract of ocean, earth, and skies</L>
<L>Myriads of creatures still successive rise;</L>
<L>Scarce buds a leaf, or springs the vilest weed,</L>
<L>But little flocks upon its verdure feed;</L>
<L>No fruit our palate courts, or flow'r or smell,</L>
<L>But on its fragrant bosom nations dwell,</L>
<L>All form'd with proper faculties to share</L>
<L>The daily bounties of their maker's care:</L>
<L>The great creator from his heav'nly throne,</L>
<L>Pleas'd, on the wide-expanded joy looks down,</L>
<L>And his eternal law is only this,</L>
<L>That all contribute to the general bliss.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nature so plain this primal law displays,</L>
<L>Each living creature sees it, and obeys;</L>
<L>Each, form'd for all, promotes thro' private care</L>
<L>The publick good, and justly tastes its share.</L>
<L>All understand their great creator's will,</L>
<L>Strive to be happy, and in that fulfill;</L>
<L>Mankind excepted; lord of all beside,</L>
<L>But only slave to folly, vice, and pride;</L>
<L><PB N="172" REF="175"/>
'Tis he that's deaf to this command alone,</L>
<L>Delights in other's woe, and courts his own;</L>
<L>Racks and destroys with tort'ring steel and flame,</L>
<L>For lux'ry brutes, and man himself for fame;</L>
<L>Sets superstition high on virtue's throne,</L>
<L>Then thinks his Maker's temper like his own;</L>
<L>Hence are his altars stain'd with reeking gore,</L>
<L>As if he cou'd atone for crimes by more:</L>
<L>Hence whilst offended heav'n he strives in vain</L>
<L>T'appease by fasts, and voluntary pain,</L>
<L>Ev'n in repenting he provokes again.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>How easy is our yoke! how light our load!</L>
<L>Did we not strive to mend the laws of God:</L>
<L>For his own sake no duty he can ask,</L>
<L>The common welfare is our only task;</L>
<L>For this sole end his precepts, kind as just,</L>
<L>Forbid imtemp'rance, murder, theft, and lust,</L>
<L>With ev'ry act injurious to our own</L>
<L>Or others good, for such are crimes alone:</L>
<L>For this are peace, love, charity enjoin'd,</L>
<L>With all that can secure and bless mankind.</L>
<L>Thus is the publick safety Virtue's cause,</L>
<L>And happiness the end of all her laws;</L>
<L>For such by nature is the human frame,</L>
<L>Our duty and our int'rest are the same.</L>

<L>But hold, crys out some Puritan divine,</L>
<L>Whose well-stuff'd cheeks with ease and plenty shine,</L>
<L><PB N="173" REF="176"/>
Is this to fast, to mortify, refrain?</L>
<L>And work salvation out with fear and pain?</L>
<L>We own, the rigid lessons of their schools</L>
<L>Are widely diff'rent from these easy rules;</L>
<L>Virtue, with them, is only to abstain</L>
<L>From all that nature asks, and covet pain;</L>
<L>Pleasure and vice are ever near a-kin,</L>
<L>And, if we thirst, cold water is a sin:</L>
<L>Heav'n's path is rough and intricate, they say,</L>
<L>Yet all are damn'd that trip, or miss their way;</L>
<L>God is a being cruel and severe,</L>
<L>And man a wretch, by his command plac'd here,</L>
<L>In sun-shine for a while to take a turn,</L>
<L>Only to dry and make him fit to burn.</L>

<L>Mistaken men, too piously severe!</L>
<L>Thro' craft misleading, or misled by fear;</L>
<L>How little they God's counsels comprehend,</L>
<L>Our universal parent, guardian, friend!</L>
<L>Who, forming by degrees to bliss mankind,</L>
<L>This globe our sportive nursery assign'd,</L>
<L>Where for a while his fond paternal care</L>
<L>Feasts us with ev'ry joy our state can bear:</L>
<L>Each sense, touch, taste, and smell dispense delight,</L>
<L>Musick our hearing, beauty charms our sight;</L>
<L>Trees, herbs, and flow'rs to us their spoils resign,</L>

Seasons but change, new pleasures to produce,</L>
<L>And elements contend to serve our use:</L>
<L>Love's gentle shafts, ambition's tow'ring wings,</L>
<L>The pomps of senates, churches, courts, and kings;</L>
<L>All that our rev'rence, joy, or hope create,</L>
<L>Are the gay play-things of this infant state.</L>
<L>Scarcely an ill to human life belongs,</L>
<L>But what our follies cause, or mutual wrongs;</L>
<L>Or if some stripes from providence we feel,</L>
<L>He strikes with pity, and but wounds to heal;</L>
<L>Kindly perhaps sometimes afflicts us here,</L>
<L>To guide our views to a sublimer sphere,</L>
<L>In more exalted joys to fix our taste,</L>
<L>And wean us from delights that cannot last.</L>
<L>Our present good the easy task is made,</L>
<L>To earn superior bliss, when this shall fade;</L>
<L>For, soon as e'er these mortal pleasures cloy,</L>
<L>His hand shall lead us to sublimer joy;</L>
<L>Snatch us from all our little sorrows here,</L>
<L>Calm every grief, and dry each childish tear;</L>
<L>Waft us to regions of eternal peace,</L>
<L>Where bliss and virtue grow with like encrease;</L>

<L>Thro' wond'rous scenes of being yet untry'd,</L>
<L>Where in each stage we shall more perfect grow,</L>

Were once these maxims fix'd, that God's our friend,</L>

<L>Inflicting endless pains for transient crimes,</L>

<L>To please him, none wou'd foolishly forbear</L>
<L>Or food, or rest, or itch in shirts of hair,</L>

<L>What reason contradicts, or cannot reach;</L>
<L>None wou'd fierce zeal for piety mistake,</L>
<L>Or malice for whatever tenet's sake,</L>

<L>No more then nymphs, by long neglect grown nice,</L>
<L>Wou'd in one female frailty sum up vice,</L>

<L>No servile tenets wou'd admittance find,</L>

<L>Of power divine, hereditary right,</L>
<L>And non-resistance to a tyrant's might:</L>

<L>THOU dearest youth, who taught me first to know</L>
<L>What pleasures from a real friendship flow,</L>
<L>When neither int'rest nor design have part,</L>
<L>But all the warmth is native of the heart.</L>
<L>Thou know'st to comfort, sooth, or entertain,</L>
<L>Joy of my health, and cordial of my pain.</L>
<L>When life seem'd failing on her latest stage,</L>
<L>And fell disease anticipated age,</L>
<L>When wasting sickness and afflictive pain,</L>
<L>By Esculapius' sons oppos'd in vain;</L>
<L>Forc'd me reluctant, desperate, to explore</L>
<L>A warmer sun, and seek a milder shore;</L>
<L>Thy steady love with unexampled truth,</L>
<L>Forsook each gay companion of thy youth,</L>
<L>Whate'er the prosp'rous or the great employs,</L>
<L>Bus'ness and int'rest, and love's softer joys,</L>
<L>The weary steps of mis'ry to attend,</L>
<L>To share distress, and make a wretch thy friend.</L>

<L>Oh! would kind heav'n, these tedious suff'rings past,</L>

<L>The milder evening of life's clouded day,</L>
<L>From bus'ness and the world's intrusion free,</L>
<L>With books, with love, with beauty and with thee;</L>
<L>No farther want, no wish yet unpossess'd</L>

<L>Who sue for glory, splendor, wealth, or pow'r,</L>

<L>And pleasures they can never taste, despise;</L>
<L>Let them still court that goddess' falser joys,</L>

Still let him load ambition's thorny shrine,</L>
<L>Fame be his portion, and contentment mine.</L>
<L>But if the gods, sinister still, deny</L>
<L>To live in Ickworth, let me there but die;</L>
<L>Thy hand to close my eyes in death's long night,</L>
<L>Thy image to attract their latest sight:</L>

<HEAD>MARRIAGE A-LA-MODE: OR, The TWO SPARROWS. A Fable.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">From Mons. DE LA MOTTE, Book IV. Fable 21.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>A Grove there was, by nature made,</L>
<L>Of trees that form'd a pleasing shade;</L>
<L>Where warbled, ever free from care,</L>
<L>The wing'd musicians of the air.</L>
<L>Here tun'd the Nightingale her throat;</L>
<L>The Thrush there thrill'd her piercing note;</L>
<L>The Finch, Lark, Linnet, all agree</L>
<L>To join the sylvan harmony.</L>
<L>Two amorous Sparrows chose this place;</L>
<L>The softest of the feather'd race:</L>
<L>The MARS and VENUS of the grove;</L>
<L>Less fam'd for singing, than for love.</L>
<L>The songsters warbled sweet; while they</L>
<L>As sweetly bill'd their time away.</L>
<L>So closely seated were the two,</L>
<L>Together you wou'd think they grew:</L>
<L>The twig was slender where they sate,</L>
<L>And bent beneath their little weight;</L>
<L><PB N="200" REF="203"/>
But scarcely in their lives was known</L>
<L>To bear the one, when one was flown.</L>
<L>When hunger call'd, they left the wood,</L>
<L>Together sought the field for food;</L>
<L>When thirsty, in the shallow rills</L>
<L>Together dip'd their little bills.</L>
<L>When PHOEBUS sitting in the west,</L>
<L>And thick'ning shades invite to rest,</L>
<L>They homeward bent their mutual flight:</L>
<L>Thus pass'd their day, thus pass'd their night.</L>
<L>The castle, where these lovers lay,</L>
<L>Was in a hollow oak, they say:</L>
<L>There, side by side, all night they kept,</L>
<L>Together wak'd, together slept:</L>
<L>And, mixing amorous disport,</L>
<L>They made their winter-evenings short.</L>
<L>Tho' free, 'twas left to either's mind,</L>
<L>To chuse a mate from all their kind,</L>
<L>She only lov'd the loving he;</L>
<L>He only lov'd the lovely she.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Pure JOY, poor mortals seldom find;</L>
<L>Her footman, SORROW, waits behind;</L>
<L>And FATE impartial deals to all</L>
<L>The honey'd potion mix'd with gall.</L>
<L>This pair, on an unhappy day,</L>
<L>Too far together chanc'd to stray:</L>
<L>Benighted, and with snares beset,</L>
<L>Our MARS and VENUS in a net,</L>
<L><PB N="201" REF="204"/>
Alas! were caught.—O change of state!</L>
<L>A little cage is now their fate.</L>
<L>No more they seek the spacious grove;</L>
<L>No more they burn with mutual love:</L>
<L>Their passion changes with their life;</L>
<L>And soon they fall from love to strife.</L>
<L>Their little souls with growing rage</L>
<L>High swell; they flutter round the cage:</L>
<L>Forget the slender twig, where late</L>
<L>Close side by side in love they sate;</L>
<L>One perch is now too small to hold</L>
<L>The fiery mate and chirping scold:</L>
<L>They peck each other o'er their food;</L>
<L>And thirst to drink each other's blood.</L>
<L>Two cages must the pair divide;</L>
<L>Or death the quarrel will decide.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A picture this of human life!</L>
<L>The modern husband, and the wife.</L>
<L>Who e'er in courtship saw a pair,</L>
<L>So kind as he, as she so fair?</L>
<L>The kisses that they gave each other,</L>
<L>You'd think had seal'd their lips together.</L>
<L>Each vows to each a mutual flame;</L>
<L>And dreams, 'twill always last the same;</L>
<L>But fix them once in HYMEN's chains,</L>
<L>And each alternately complains.</L>
<L>The honey-moon is scarce declin'd,</L>
<L>But all the honey of their mind</L>
<L>Is gone; and leaves the sting behind.</L>
<L><PB N="202" REF="205"/>
The scene of love is vanish'd quite:</L>
<L>They pout, grow peevish, scold, and fight.</L>
<L>Two tables feed each parted guest;</L>
<L>Two beds receive the pair to rest:</L>
<L>And law alone can end the strife,</L>

"Lo, in that gloomy place below,</L>

<L>The sovereign spake, the gods agree,</L>

<L>Behind the throne of Jove there stood</L>
<L>Two vessels of celestial wood,</L>

<L>One fill'd with pains, and one with pleasures;</L>
<L>The Gods drew out from both of these,</L>

<L>Those who with pious pain pursue</L>
<L>Calm virtue by her sacred clue,</L>
<L>Will surely find the mental treasure</L>
<L>Of virtue, only real pleasure:</L>
<L>Follow the pleasurable road,</L>
<L>That fatal Siren reckons good,</L>
<L>'Twill lead thee to the gloomy cell,</L>
<L>Where pain and melancholy dwell.</L>
<L>Health is the child of abstinence,</L>
<L>Disease, of a luxurious sense;</L>
<L>Despair, that hellish fiend, proceeds</L>
<L>From loosen'd thoughts, and impious deeds,</L>
<L>And the sweet offspring of content,</L>
<L>Flows from the mind's calm government.</L>
<L>Thus, man, thy state is free from woe,</L>
<L>If thou would'st chuse to make it so.</L>
<L>Murmur not then at Heav'n's decree,</L>
<L>The gods have giv'n thee liberty,</L>

<L>Pale discontent, and sullen hate</L>

<L>Her left-hand clench'd, her cheek sustain'd,</L>

But not to damp the muse's fire</L>
<L>With rhet'rick, such as courts require,</L>

<L>Virtue and social love, he said,</L>

<L>That PATRIOTS now, like other folks,</L>
<L>Were made the butt of vulgar jokes;</L>

<L>Why some submitted, some assail'd,</L>
<L>Angry or pleas'd—all solv'd the doubt</L>
<L>With who were in, and who were out.</L>
<L>The sons of CLAMOUR grew so sickly,</L>

<L>Were sunk in privies all besh—n;</L>
<L>Old-England, and the London-Evening,</L>

<L>Ask ye whence rose this foul disgrace?</L>
<L>Why SELIM has receiv'd a place,</L>
<L>And thereby brought the cause to shame;</L>

<L>Might serve their country and their king,</L>
<L>By making both the self-same thing.</L>
<L><PB N="247" REF="250"/>
By which the credulous believ'd,</L>
<L>And others (by strange arts deceiv'd)</L>
<L>That Ministers were sometimes right,</L>
<L>And meant not to destroy us quite.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>That bart'ring thus in state affairs,</L>
<L>He next must deal in sacred wares,</L>
<L>The clergy's rights divine invade,</L>
<L>And smuggle in the gospel-trade.</L>
<L>And all this zeal to re-instate</L>
<L>Exploded notions, out of date;</L>
<L>Sending old rakes to church in shoals,</L>
<L>Like children, sniv'ling for their souls,</L>
<L>And ladies gay, from smut and libels,</L>
<L>To learn beliefs, and read their bibles;</L>
<L>Erecting conscience for a tutor,</L>

And if there should be one, no doubt</L>

<L>And barely stopp'd on this side murther;</L>
<L>One yet remain'd to close the charge,</L>
<L>To which (with leave) he'd speak at large.</L>
<L>And first 'twas needful to premise,</L>
<L>That tho' so long (for reasons wise)</L>
<L>The press inviolate had stood,</L>
<L>Productive of the publick good;</L>
<L>Yet still, too modest to abuse,</L>
<L>It rail'd at vice, but told not whose.</L>
<L>That great improvements, of late days</L>
<L>Were made to many an author's praise,</L>
<L>Who, not so scrupulously nice,</L>
<L>Proclaim'd the person with the vice,</L>
<L>Or gave, where vices might be wanted,</L>
<L>The name, and took the rest for granted.</L>
<L>Upon this plan, a Champion <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Author of the letters to the Whigs.</NOTE> rose,</L>
<L>Unrighteous greatness to oppose,</L>
<L>Proving the man <HI>inventus non est,</HI></L>
<L>Who trades in pow'r, and still is honest;</L>
<L>And (God be prais'd) he did it roundly,</L>
<L>Flogging a certain junto soundly.</L>
<L>But chief his anger was directed,</L>
<L>Where people least of all suspected;</L>
<L><PB N="249" REF="252"/>
And SELIM, not so strong as tall,</L>
<L>Beneath his grasp appear'd to fall.</L>
<L>But INNOCENCE (as people say)</L>
<L>Stood by, and sav'd him in the fray.</L>
<L>By her assisted, and one TRUTH,</L>
<L>A busy, prating, forward youth,</L>
<L>He rally'd all his strength anew,</L>
<L>And at the foe a Letter threw,</L>
<L>His weakest part the weapon found,</L>
<L>And brought him senseless to the ground.</L>
<L>Hence OPPOSITION fled the field,</L>
<L>And IGN'RANCE with her sev'n-fold shield;</L>
<L>And well they might, for (things weigh'd fully)</L>
<L>The pris'ner, with his Whore and Bully,</L>
<L>Must prove for ev'ry foe too hard,</L>
<L>Who never fought with such a guard.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But TRUTH and INNOCENCE, he said,</L>
<L>Would stand him here in little stead,</L>
<L>For they had evidence on oath,</L>
<L>That would appear too hard for both.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Of witnesses a fearful train</L>
<L>Came next, th' indictments to sustain;</L>
<L>DETRACTION, HATRED, and DISTRUST,</L>
<L>And PARTY, of all foes the worst,</L>
<L>MALICE, REVENGE, and UNBELIEF,</L>

<L>DISHONOUR foul, unaw'd by shame,</L>

All these in ample form depos'd</L>
<L>Each fact the triple charge disclos'd,</L>

<L>The pris'ner said in his defence,</L>
<L>That he indeed had small pretence</L>
<L>To soften facts so deeply sworn,</L>
<L>But would for his offences mourn;</L>
<L>Yet more he hop'd than bare repentance</L>
<L>Might still be urg'd to ward the sentence.</L>
<L>That he had held a place some years,</L>
<L>He own'd with penitence and tears,</L>
<L>But took it not from motives base,</L>
<L>Th' indictment there mistook the case;</L>
<L>And tho' he had betray'd his trust,</L>

<L>Neglecting FACTION and her friends,</L>
<L>He did it not for wicked ends,</L>
<L>But that complaints and feuds might cease,</L>
<L>And jarring parties mix in peace.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>That what he wrote to GILBERT WEST</L>
<L>Bore hard against him, he confess'd;</L>
<L>Yet there they wrong'd him; for the fact is,</L>
<L>He reason'd for Belief, not Practice;</L>
<L>And people might believe, he thought,</L>
<L>Tho' Practice might be deem'd a fault.</L>
<L>He either dreamt it, or was told,</L>
<L>Religion was rever'd of old,</L>
<L><PB N="251" REF="254"/>
That it gave breeding no offence,</L>
<L>And was no foe to wit and sense;</L>
<L>But whether this was truth, or whim,</L>
<L>He would not say; the doubt with him</L>
<L>(And no great harm he hop'd) was how</L>
<L>Th' enlighten'd world would take it now;</L>
<L>If they admitted it, 'twas well,</L>
<L>If not, he never talk'd of hell,</L>
<L>Nor even hop'd to change men's measures,</L>
<L>Or frighten ladies from their pleasures.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>One accusation, he confess'd,</L>
<L>Had touch'd him more than all the rest;</L>
<L>Three Patriot-Letters, high in fame,</L>
<L>By him o'erthrown, and brought to shame.</L>
<L>And tho' it was a rule in vogue,</L>

You! who were OPPOSITION's lord!</L>
<L>Her nerves, her sinews, and her sword!</L>
<L>That you at last, for servile ends,</L>
<L>Should wound the bowels of her friends!—</L>
<L>Is aggravation of offence,</L>
<L>That leaves for mercy no pretence.</L>
<L>Yet more—for you to urge your hate,</L>

<L>You! who have known RELIGION better!</L>
<L>For you, I say, to introduce</L>

<L>And last of all, to crown your shame,</L>
<L>Was it for you to load with blame</L>
<L>The writings of a Patriot-Youth,</L>
<L>And summon INNOCENCE and TRUTH</L>
<L>To prop your cause?—Was this for you?—</L>
<L>But Justice does your crimes pursue;</L>
<L>And sentence now alone remains,</L>
<L>Which thus, by me, the court ordains.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"That you return from whence you came,</L>
<L>"There to be stripp'd of all your fame</L>
<L>"By vulgar hands; that once a week</L>
<L>"Old-England pinch you till you squeak;</L>

<P>Verse 1, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The various and ridiculous pretensions of mankind to Honour and Fame enumerated.</P>
<P>Verse 21. Tho' they are thus inconstant and contradic∣tory, yet true Honour is a thing fixed and determinate.</P>
<P>Verse 29. If we would form an impartial judgment of what is truly honourable, we must abstract all conside∣rations which regard ourselves.</P>
<P>Verse 32. Not only so, but we must remove ourselves to a proper distance from the object we examine, lest some part should predominate in our eye, and occasion a false judgment of the whole.</P>
<P>Verse 48. Therefore the surest method is, to prove by past examples what commands our love and esteem.</P>
<P>Verse 50, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Expence and grandeur cannot give true Honour: Their most splendid monuments vanish; and even should they last for ever, could not bestow real glory, if only the records of Pride, Tyranny and Vice.</P>
<P>Verse 72, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Much less if purchas'd by Oppression and Guilt.</P>
<P>Verse 86, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> True Honour is not to be reaped from un∣just Conquest: It is not Victory, but a just Cause that can engage our Esteem.</P>
<P>Verse 116. Neither is true glory to be obtained by wit or science: They are chimerical: Sometimes attended with folly, and weakness; often stained with vice, and so render their possessors mischievous and infamous.</P>
<P>Verse 138. The foundation os true Honour is Virtue only.</P>
<P>Verse 153. It is Virtue only that gives the poet lasting glory: this proved by instances.</P>
<P>Verse 164. The Philosopher can only hope for true glory from the same source; because Truth is his object, and nothing can be Truth that tends to destroy Virtue and happiness.</P>
<P>Verse 174. Hence appears the madness, infamy, and falsehood of those destructive schemes set on foot by the sect called Free Thinkers.</P>
<P>Verse 180. Falsehood short-lived: Truth eternal.</P>
<P>Verse 184, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Examples of the two most illustrious phi∣losophers that ever adorned the world; the one excellent in moral, the other in natural knowledge.</P>
<P>Verse 198, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Kings, statesmen, and patriots must build, their fame on virtue.</P>
<P>Verse 204. Flattery cannot raise folly or vice into true glory.</P>
<P>Verse 222. Thus it appears that every one has the power of obtaining true honour, by promoting the happiness of mankind in his proper station.</P>
<P>Verse 226. And thus the love of fame, tho' often per∣verted to bad ends, is naturally conducive to virtue and happiness.</P>
<P>Verse 230, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> True honour characteriz'd and exem∣plify'd.</P>

<P>Mandeville.] The Author of that monstrous heap of con∣tradiction and absurdity, "<HI>The Fable of the Bees, or pri∣vate Vices publick Benefits.</HI>" The reader who is ac∣quainted with the writings of these Gentlemen, will proba∣bly observe a kind of climax in this place; ascending from those who have attempted to destroy the several fences of virtue, to the wild boars of the wood that root it up.</P>

<L>Blind to ourselves, by sordid fear oppress'd,</L>
<L>We seek our virtues in each other's breast;</L>

<L>And but for shame, like Sylla, quit the field:</L>
<L>The daemon Shame paints strong the ridicule,</L>
<L>And whispers close "the world will call you fool."</L>
<L>Behold, yon wretch, to impious madness driv'n,</L>

<L>By weakness strong, and bold thro' fear alone,</L>

<L>Let SATIRE next, her proper limits know;</L>
<L>And ere she strike, besure she strikes a foe.</L>
<L>Nor fondly deem, you spy a real fool</L>
<L>At each gay impulse of blind ridicule;</L>
<L>Before whose altar virtue oft' hath bled,</L>
<L>And oft' a fated victim shall be led:</L>
<L>Lo! <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><P>It were to be wished that lord Shaftsbury had expressed himself with greater precision on this subject: however, thus much may be affirmed with truth.</P>
<P>1st, By the general tenour of his essays on Enthusiasm, and the Freedom of Wit and Humour, it appears that his principal design was to recommend the way of Ridicule (as he calls it) for the investigation of truth, and detec∣tion of falshood, not only in moral but religious subjects.</P>
<P>2dly, It appears no less evident, that in the course of his reasonings on this question, he confounds two things which are in their nature and consequences entirely dif∣ferent. They are, Ridicule and Good-humour: the latter acknowledged by all to be the best mediator in every debate; the former no less regarded by most, as an Embroiler and Incendiary. Tho' he sets out with a formal profession of proving the efficacy of wit, humour, and ridicule in the investigation of truth, yet by shifting and mixing his terms, he generally slides insensibly into mere encomiums on good∣breeding, cheerfulness, urbanity, and free enquiry. This indeed keeps something like an argument on foot, and amuses the superficial reader; but to a more observant eye disco∣vers a very contemptible defect either of sincerity or pene∣tration.</P>
<P>The question concerning Ridicule may be thus not impro∣perly stated: Whether doubtful propositions of any kind can be ascertained by the application of ridicule? Much might be said on this question; but a few words will make the mat∣ter clear to an unprejudic'd mind.</P>
<P>The disapprobation or contempt which certain objects raise in the mind of man, is a particular mode of passion: the objects of this passion are apparent falshood, incon∣gruity, or impropriety of some particular kinds. Thus, the object of fear is apparent danger, or probable approach∣ing ill. But who has ever dreamt of exalting the passion of fear into a standard or test of real danger? The de∣sign must have been rejected as absurd, because it is the work of reason only, to correct and fix the passion on its proper objects. The case is parallel: apparent or seem∣ing falshoods, &amp;c. are the objects of contempt, but it is the work of reason only, to determine whether the supposed falshoods be real or fictitious. But it is said, <Q REND="inline">"The sense of ridicule can never be mistaken."</Q>—Why, no more can the sense of Danger.—<Q REND="inline">"What, do men never fear without reason?"</Q>—Yes, very commonly; but they as often despise and laugh without reason. And thus, before any thing can be determined in either case, reason, and reason only, must examine circumstances, seperate ideas, decide upon, restrain, and correct the passion.</P>
<P>Hence it follows, that the way of ridicule is in fact no more than a species of eloquence: It applies to a passion, and therefore can go no farther in the investigation of truth, than any of those arts which tend to raise love, pity, terror, rage or hatred in the heart of man. Consequent∣ly, his lordship might have transplanted the whole system of rhetorick into his new scheme, with the same propriety as he hath introduced the way of ridicule itself. A hope∣ful project this, for the propagation of truth!</P>
<P>As this seems to be the real nature and tendency of ridicule, it hath been generally discouraged by philoso∣phers and divines, together with every other mode of elo∣quence, when apply'd to controverted opinions. This dis∣couragement, from what is said above, appears to have been rational and just; therefore the charge laid against divines with regard to this affair by a zealous admirer of lord Shaftsbury (See a note on the Pleasures of Imagination, Book III.) seems entirely groundless. The distinction which the same author hath attempted with respect to the influence of ridicule, between speculative and moral truths, seems no better founded. It is certain that opinions are no less liable to ridicule than actions. And it is no less certain that the way of ridicule, cannot determine the pro∣priety or impropriety of the one, more than the truth of the other; because the same passion of contempt is equally engaged in both cases, and therefore (as above) reason only can examine the circumstances of the action or opinion, and thus fix the passion on its proper objects.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, this new design of discovering truth by the vague and unsteady light of ridicule, puts one in mind of the honest Irishman, who apply'd his candle to he sun-dial in order to see how the night went.</P></NOTE> Shaftsb'ry rears her high on reason's throne,</L>

<L>As goblins vanish at approaching light;</L>
<L>The gentle Thames, that pours his urn fast by,</L>
<L>Surveys the structure with revering eye:</L>
<L>To a clear mirror smooths his glassy tide,</L>
<L>Proud to reflect a nation's justest pride.</L>
<L>But oh! what thoughts, what numbers shall I find,</L>
<L>But faintly to express the poet's mind?</L>
<L>Who yonder star's effulgence can display,</L>
<L>Unless he dip his pencil in the ray?</L>
<L>Who paint a God, unless the God inspire?</L>
<L>What catch the lightning, but the speed of fire?</L>
<L>So, mighty POPE, to make thy genius known,</L>
<L>All pow'r is weak, all numbers—but thy own.</L>
<L>For thee each Muse with kind contention strove,</L>
<L>For thee the Graces left th'Idalian grove;</L>
<L>With watchful fondness o'er thy cradle hung,</L>
<L>Attun'd thy voice, and form'd thy infant tongue.</L>
<L>Next, to her bard majestick Wisdom came;</L>
<L>The bard enraptur'd caught the vigorous flame:</L>
<L>With taste superior scorn'd the venal tribe;</L>
<L>Whom fear can sway, or guilty greatness bribe;</L>
<L>At fancy's call who rear the wanton sail,</L>
<L>Sport with the stream, and trifle in the gale.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Sublimer views thy daring spirit bound;</L>
<L>Thy mighty voyage was creation's round;</L>

Intent, new worlds of science to explore,</L>
<L>And bless mankind with wisdom's sacred store;</L>
<L>A nobler joy than wit can give, impart;</L>
<L>And pour a moral transport o'er the heart.</L>
<L>Fantastick wit shoots momentaty fires,</L>
<L>And like a meteor, while we gaze, expires;</L>
<L>Wit kindled by the sulph'rous breath of vice,</L>

<L>Mildly dispells each wintry passion's gloom,</L>

<L>Thy genius was indeed a gift from heav'n.</L>
<L>Hail, bard unequal'd, in whose deathless line</L>
<L>Reason and wit with strength collected shine;</L>

<L>Lost, nobly lost, in Truth's superior blaze.</L>
<L>Did friendship e'er mislead his wandering muse?</L>
<L>O let that friendship plead the great excuse;</L>
<L>That sacred friendship which inspir'd his song,</L>

<L>Light her pale lamp at your immortal fire?</L>

Shou'd she attempt, O may she faultless claim</L>
<L>A small, a temporary wreath of fame?</L>
<L>If such her fate; do thou, fair Truth, descend,</L>
<L>And watchful guard her in an honest end;</L>
<L>Kindly severe, instruct her equal line</L>
<L>To court no friend, nor own a foe, but thine.</L>
<L>But if her giddy eye shou'd vainly quit</L>
<L>Thy sacred paths, to run the maze of wit;</L>
<L>If her apostate heart shou'd e'er incline</L>
