<L>From <HI>Public Gratitude</HI> the notes arise,</L>

<L>Lo, Albion's ardent sons the deed approve,</L>

<L>This, this the moment, Britons, ye should chuse,</L>

<SALUTE>MR. URBAN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>TRUE GLORY GUIDES NO ECHOING CAR—as is now exemplified in the noiseless tenour of the way long pursued, in his going about doing good, by the most truly glorious of mortal beings. When I give him this title, I flatter myself that but few of your readers will want to be informed, that I mean the <HI>Consummate Philanthropist,</HI> who who has so fully and feelingly demonstrated, that indeed nothing hu∣man is alien from him, by having given himself up to the softening the sorrows and sufferings of some of the most unworthy, as well as of the most unfortunate of our race, in that to the horrors of a prison, where the iron so often enters into the soul, horrors should not be added. Urged by strong benevolence of soul from his pleasant home, and his more pleasant friends, who, I should suppose, do honour him but just on this side idolatry, he is now, instead of rattling in a tri∣umphal car, gliding tranquilly on the sea, apparently but an obscure passenger, amidst all the wants of ease and accommodation, at about 60 years of age, in a common vessel, to dare the vile contagion of the Turks, and, if he cannot purge their air of pestilence, to try at least to correct its virulence, retard its progress, and be blessed by thousands saved from untimely death. In the only hour that I had ever the happiness and the honour of his conversation, two months ago in Italy,
<PB N="20" REF="18"/>I did all but worship him. He was then at Rome, which for once saw, but knew him not, a true vicar of the God of Mercy, by whom the man that, when his fellow-creature was in prison came unto him, and performed other acts of charity, shall be placed on the right-hand of his throne; and was going to visit the lazarettos at Naples and at Mal∣ta, and thence to Constantinople. He will be absent somewhat above a year. He cherishes a hope, that the means he has discovered to check the influence of the jail infection will be efficacious likewise against the plague; and, to make the trial, abandons his comforts, and risks his life. Glorious man! God-fulfil his hope, and send him sase back, to be still an ornament to human nature in general, and, in porticular, to this glorious country which produced him, and which an accomplished daughter of it has lately told us she has the daily delight to hear applanded in others as eminently just, generous, and humane! I please myself with thinking what a host will join me in the wish. But shall we be content with giving him but empty words, and not avail ourselves of the only opportunity, which in all proba∣bility we can ever have till he rest from his god-like labours, of doing ourselves honour, in doing, to speak humanly, a solid and a solemn one to him? Suppose, Mr. Urban, you were to erect a statue to him? Entertaining as great an opinion of the glorious possibilities of the English character, as Lord Chatham could do of those of the English constitution, I persuade myself that you would be quickly fur∣nished with the means, in only calling, by the publication of the hint in your next Magazine but for a single guinea (though the opulent need not be stinted) upon those of the just, generous, and humane, amongst us, who can easily afford themselves the pleasure of giving a testimony to their exalted sense of what our nature owes to Mr. HOWARD. How truly has he ennobled the name! Before this glo∣rious man arose, what has been ever done for mankind by <HI>all the
<PB N="21" REF="19"/>blood of all the Howards?</HI> Ye little stars, hide your diminished rays! More I think will be furnished than is requisite to erect a statue; the overplus will go almost self-directed to the jails. A bust, or picture of him, for a sculptor to work from, can, without doubt, be supplied by some friend. You and your corresondents will think of the pro∣per spot in which the statue should be placed, and of the inscription for it. But no time is to be lost; for, if it be not executed before his return, Mr. Howard's humble sense of his own inerits would most cer∣tainly prevent it. Alas, alas, Mr. Urban, what are posthumous ho∣nours! No! <HI>praesenti illi.</HI>—Insluenced only by our admiration and our love of such virtue as we must confess hath never yet arisen but in Mr. Howard, let us render it mature honours whilst it is yet present with us in this world, as the best foundation for not despairing that equal virtue may yet arise.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>ANGLUS.</SIGNED>
<POSTSCRIPT>
<P>P. S. Your wonder perhaps, Mr. Urban, and I am sure your in∣dignation, will be excited, when you are informed that, in a country pretending modestly to be the most highly civilized, and in this age, when so much more light than heretofore, and, one would hope, con∣sequent goodness, are diffused, some of the ruling powers of that country could harbour the thought of seizing upon Mr. Howard in his passage through it, for having, in the hope they might be re∣formed, made abuses known, in a book published in another country and another language. That he was not seized, is undoubtedly owing to the light which is diffused.</P>
<P>When I asked Mr. Howard, with what antiseptic he arms himself when he ventures into those mansions of misery and infection, which, for the sake of his fellow-creatures, he has long frequented, and is now again seeking in a distant land; he told me, that he trusts, under God, to extreme <HI>cleanliness</HI> alone; of the property of which to re∣sist, or rather afford no hold to, infection, he entertains a great, and,
<PB N="22" REF="20"/>from experience, just idea. An additional recommendation this to the decency and the comfort of that charming quality, I had almost said, virtue, the concomitant of civilisation. That the most uncivilised people are the most dirty, will not, I believe, be controverted; and, if the converse of the proposition be equally true, let it not be for∣gotten by the travellers in <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>{inverted ⁂}Having the same opinion with our correspondent of "this Consummate Philanthropist," and of "the glorious possibility of the English character;" our printer (Mr. Nichols, in Red-Lion Passage, Flect-street) has undertaken to receive subscriptions for this purpose till the end of June; before which period some respectable bankers will be requested to assist this laudable proposal.

<P>TO evince my approbation of erecting a MONUMENT to commemo∣rate the godlike actions of the <HI>living</HI> HOWARD, I inclose a draught for ten guineas, to be appropriated to that DESIGN.</P>
<P>Persnaded as I am, that his character and writings will survive the most durable monument of friendship; yet such an example of appro∣bation appears to me calculated to promote many beneficial purposes, though it cannot augment the zeal of this amiable man in the pursuit of lessening human misery. Public approbation of private and publick virtues, whilst it acknowledges a debt due to intrinsic merit, reflects the highest honour on the community; for to reward virtue is a pleas∣ing proof of its prevalence; and that it does prevail, the MONUMENT of HOWARD will testify.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="21"/>Virtue, whether shining in the public walks of life, or emitting the soft rays of human benevolence in the dungeous of misery, will ever obtain its own internal reward beyond all the powers of sculpture; but to exhibit that evidence to the public, to excite emulation in vir∣tuous pursuits, and to induce spectators to go and do so likewise, nothing seems more conducive than a MONUMENT to HOWARD.</P>
<P>The present moment, during his absence in TURKEY, is the most proper to accomplish such a DESIGN. With goodness of heart he unites exemplary humility; and a perfection of mind, rarely equalled, is veiled by a modesty that shuns praise and adulation; but the public applause which is due to great and virtuous actions cannot be ungratesul to the god-like breast of HOWARD.</P>
<P>Suppose therefore the first FIVE persons who subscribe TEN GUINEAS each, or upwards, be appointed a <HI>committee</HI> to carry such a DESIGN into execution; which <HI>committee</HI> may be afterwards augmented, by se∣lecting from the subseribers at large such persons whose taste and abilities may further assist in <HI>designing</HI> a MONUMENT to HOWARD.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>JOHN COAKLEY LETTSOM.</SIGNED>
<POSTSCRIPT>
<P>P. S. If this Paper be thought worthy of insertion in the Gentle∣man's Magazine, I have no objection to its publication; nor have I any to being appointed to receive subscriptions with any banker or bankers, further to insure success.</P>
<P>As there are many circumstances singular in the conduct of HOWARD, which tend to his security, besides <HI>cleanliness,</HI> I thought of adding some outlines of his history: but, fearful of diverting the public attention from the subject of a monument, I have refrained from such addition, though, would it prove acceptable, I could perhaps prepare a little essay for a subsequent Magazine, and am, respectfully, J. C. LETTSOM.</P>
<P>{inverted ⁂}We thankfully accept the offers of this truly benevolent cor∣respondent; and shall be obliged to him for his proposed communica∣tion.
<PB N="24" REF="22"/>Subscriptions for the MONUMENT to HOWARD will now be received by Messrs. R. and F. GOSLING, bankers, Fleet-street; Dr. LETTSOM, Basinghall-street; and J. NICHOLS, Red Lion Passage, Fleet-street; till the last day of September: by which time, it is hoped, a sufficient fund will be raised. If our expectations are disappointed, the sub∣scriptions shall then be punctually returned. EDIT.</P>

<P>THOUGH it has been my lot <HI>(I will not say my happy lot)</HI> to have lived with, and conversed much among, what are generally called the <HI>great men</HI> of this nation, yet I consider the greatest honour I have re∣ceived, during a long and chequered life, to be a visit made me <HI>on persone</HI> by Mr. Howard; his <HI>unsolicited</HI> name as a subscriber to a poor persormance of mine; and a present of his own immortal deeds; deeds so fraught with benevolence, and told with such modesty, humi∣lity, and philanthropy, that he, who can read them without feeling a reverential awe for the <HI>doer,</HI> must be unworthy of the name of man. I therefore send you a draft on Messrs. Hoares for one guinea, that I may contribute my mite towards the erection of a statue to immortalize THE PERSON of Mr. Howard; his virtues and his writings will im∣mortalize his name. I am sorry to say it is inconvenient for me to do more; yet, rather than the work should not be carried into immediate execution, while the worthy and modest object of it is abroad, you may call upon me for nine more; for who would not put themselves to some inconvenience to render respect to the memory (as Dr. Lettsom justly styles him) of the GOD-LIKE HOWARD? One stately tree in my garden has long since borne his name on its rind: and may the hand wither, like its leaves in Autumn, who dares to erase it!</P>

<SALUTE>MR. URBAN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>OF the proposal, suggested by your ingenious and benevolent Cor∣respondent ANGLUS, to erect a statue in honour of Mr. Howard, I most cordially approve; and where is to be found a man of sense and virtue that will not say the same? Statesmen are the corruption, and heroes the destroyers, of the human species; but Mr. Howard is, in the noblest and most unequivocal sense of the word, their preserver. I can myself feel the importance of his services more than the generality of his readers, as, from motives not quite dissimilar from his own, I have been long accustomed to visit prisons, and perform, now and then, those offices of charity which are too much neglected even by wise and good men, and which, if I had not been writing on a subject endeared to me by long and solemn reflexion, I should not have presumed to mention con∣cerning myself.—Anglus seems to call upon your readers in general, not merely for approbation, but assistance. In what manner then does he mean me to assist? for it is a righteous cause, and my heart is with it. On Mr. Howard himself it were a panegyric to expatiate in that language which truth itself would warrant. Argument and persuasion are anticipated by the general and just celebrity he has attained; and it seems to me, that merely to propose the statue is sufficient to secure the concurrence of those who reverence the character of Mr. Howard: but as to the penurious and the unfeeling, I must say, with a little accommodation of Sallust, <HI>verba viris</HI> virtuem <HI>non addere.</HI> In the pre∣sent state of things, I can only request to be put down as a subscriber, and to be considered as a most sincere well-wisher.</P>

We agree with them that every thing centers in <HI>self;</HI> nor can it be otherwise; but were there not goodness in man's nature, how could he be capable of such gratifications as these? Even the sensation experienced by the insignificant individual who is scribbling to you, is an irrefragable argument against their system; and how much more strong and noble a one is supplied by the life and actions of Mr. Howard, the god-like man, as he has been well styled, and of whom we have so much reason to be proud! What can be a more glorious part to act, than that of the <HI>Friend to Nature,</HI> and <HI>a Second to God,</HI> in the relief of his suffering creatures! That is Mr. Howard's part, and his place in the scale of beings. A friend of mine amused himself some time ago in delineating that scale; but though he employed much thought upon it, he could not settle it quite to his satisfaction. I send it you as a cud for your readers to chew, if you think it worthy of them. My friend, I say, could not settle it quite to his satisfaction, as he doubted whether the second term in the descending series ought not to be put lower, nay, ought not to be the last but <HI>one.</HI></P>

<P>WITHIN the last three hours I have received my Gentleman's Magazine for June; and, while warm from the impression of some ar∣ticles which have caught my eye, I sit down to shew that, sensible as I am (with Mr. Thicknesse, see p. 485 of the Magazine) that the good I do in the world is but inconsiderable, I am at least a well-<HI>wisher</HI> to good∣ness, and forward to add my poor testimony of approbation to those who have arrived at an exalted degree of it. In this view, I commit to your care a draught for ten guineas, as my contribution to the pro∣posed monument for that man who, as we are told was done by the Founder of the religion of which it should seem Mr. Howard is a catholic and large-minded member, goes about doing good. I hope, and am persuaded, there are far too many persons who would be in haste to stand forward on such an occasion, and who get your Mis∣cellany the moment it comes out, to leave a possibility of me, at this distance, being one of the first five proposed by Dr. Lettsom, for a Committee; to compose which, it would seem, none are proper per∣sons but residents about the metropolis, and who have a knowledge of the arts of design <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. HICKEY, Mr. SANDERS, and Mr. FLAXMAN, Artists, have, in a most liberal and disinterested manner, testified a great desire of being favoured with the instructions of any of the friends of Mr. Howard, intimately acquainted with his features, in order to furnish the Committee with a likeness of him.

<P>IT affords me infinite pleasure that my valuable friend, Dr. Lett∣som, has seriously aided your God-like proposal of erecting a statue for Mr. Howard; as I am certain public and honourable distinctions to the superior excellent must be deeply impressed upon minds disposed to promote private and publick good, and that some such persons will become usefully active in society; and though in a century there will hardly be a HOWARD, yet actions may be performed that may endear other characters to the community. God grant that many such men may come forward, and prove themselves valuable members of society!</P>

<P>I CANNOT name this gentleman (Mr. HOWARD) without re∣marking, that his labours and writings have done much to open the eyes and hearts of mankind.

His plan is original; and it is as full of genius as it is of humanity. It was a voyage of discovery, a circumnaviga∣tion of charity. Already the benefit of his labour is felt, more or less, in every country: I hope he will anticipate his final reward, by seeing all its effects fully realized in his own. He will receive, not by retail, but in gross, the reward of those who visit the prisoner; and he has so forestalled and monopolized this branch of charity, that there will be, I trust, little room to merit by such acts of benevolence here∣after.</P>

<SALUTE>MR. URBAN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS I was charmed with the idea of erecting a statue to Mr. Howard, I beg your acceptance of my mite towards so good a work; and this sentimental offering should have been larger, were it not for the ex∣pence of some living statues, which I am at this time raising to myself. A plan so truly national meets my ideas in every point of view; but its <HI>grand</HI> effect I hope and trust will be, that, by this pointed distinc∣tion, a door may be opened for the revival of good sense, and for the restoration of that honour to virtue, which has so long been engrossed by every thing that is opposite to it.</P>
<P>It is a melancholy truth, Mr. Urban, that, for these last twenty years, the epithets of <HI>famous, celebrated,</HI> &amp;c. have scarcely ever been applied, except to persons answering to some of the following descrip∣tions; viz. First, rebels; secondly, strumpets; thirdly, rogues, high∣waymen, &amp;c.; fourthly, Atheistical or Deistical writers. These, I say, have for some time been the <HI>ton;</HI> but I flatter myself, that the immortal honours, intended to be conferred on our great philanthropist, may be a means to prevent the vicious from assuming those titles which they and their dupes have been so lavishly bestowing on each other, May we not, I say, indulge a pleasing expectation, that this, through God's good providence, may become an epoch in the moral history of mankind; and that, under such auspices, the public man may henceforth become what he always ought to have been, —uni aequus virtuti atque ejus amicis?— in consequence of which pious hope, I rejoice and exult in the oppor∣tunity of contributing my humble sanction and support to the business you have in hand.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="29"/>Besides this, I think the British nation is very properly consulting its own, honour, by perpetuating that of Mr. Howard. This is now the <HI>third</HI> time that England has produced a Worthy of such eminence as to be not only <HI>unrival'd,</HI> but even, I think we may add, <HI>inimitable</HI>—it is easy to suppose I refer to the names of SHAKSPEARE, NEWTON, and HOWARD. These are men whose expansion of soul, and exaltation of genius, in their several lines, have set them clearly, and <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, above the rest of their species of whatever age or nation—indeed I was tempted to have squared the circle, by superadding the name of ALFRED, if our ideas of him had been sufficiently precise and incon∣trovertible.</P>
<P>I hope it will not be deemed too light and fanciful if I add, that <HI>H,</HI> which has been said to be <HI>no</HI> letter, bids fair to become the most honourable letter in the alphabet, since it has, in the present age, produced, or rather introduced, the names of a HOWARD, a HANWAY, and a HETHERINGTON.</P>

<SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE it in contemplation to erect a considerable building, in St. George's Fields, in the form of a Crescent, after a plan drawn by Mr. George Dance. I should be well inclined it should receive the appellation of <HI>Howard's Crescent,</HI> or any other which you may think most conducible to perpetuate a name which does such infinite honour to our country, and to human nature; and to the bearer of which you are so very laudably engaged in endeavouring to raise a monument of public gratitude. The centre of this Crescent will be in a line with the Obelisk in St. Geórge's Fields, and that standing at the top of Bridge-Street, opposite to Fleet-market, as you will see by the plan <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This plan, of which an engraving shall be given in the next Gentleman's Ma∣gazine, may be seen at Messrs. Goslings, in Fleet-Street.</NOTE> which I have sent for your inspection. Now, Gentlemen, it is for you to consider whether the centre of this Crescent may not be a proper spot on which to erect this monument; or, if the spot of the Obelisk should be preferred, that erection might be moved to the centre of the Crescent; and then <HI>Howard's Column,</HI> and <HI>Howard's Crescent,</HI> would be separated but by space enough to prevent the two objects from being confounded.</P>

<HEAD>From the GENERAL EVENING POST <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">With a liberality inspired by the subject, this and the following letter were copied into almost every News-paper printed in the metropolis, and into many even of the provincial papers.</NOTE></HEAD>
<HEAD>To the Committee of the Subscribers to the national Design of erecting a Statue to Mr. Howard.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>FROM the rapid progress of the subscription, in which are already many names great in goodness, learning, elegance, and sensibility, as well as rank, I cannot doubt but that you will soon see it filled in a manner becoming a design formed to enkindle all the sparks of nature in every lover of virtue and his species, and becoming, what I have the pleasure to believe I may truly call, the most virtuous, and, in its individuals, the most opulent nation under Heaven. But when you have the means, how is this design to be completed, and where (is one of the first questions naturally asked) is the Statue to be placed? You are pleased to invite the correspondence of any friend to the design. I am a warm one to it; and to express how warm a one, I cannot do better than adopt the words of a great Ornament of our country in his letter in the last Gentleman's Magazine <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See above, p. 25.</NOTE>, and say with him, I feel that "It is a righteou cause, and my heart is with it." In consequence of your invitation, therefore, having contributed my mite of money, I beg leave to contribute my mite of suggestion also, in regard chiesly to a spot in which to place the Statue, with the most general approba∣tion: I say the <HI>most</HI> general approbation, well knowing that, if he shed not a miraculous influence on their minds, Michael the Archangel could no more think of a spot to place it in, than a Michael Angelo,
<PB N="34" REF="32"/>or even a Phidias or Praxiteles, could sculpture it, so as to please every critic. And how is that most general approbation to be consulted and collected, but by early throwing out ideas to the public, in the hope to provoke good judgements to amend them, or rather furnish more acceptable ideas in their stead?</P>
<P>I will suppose then, what at present there seems to be a happy prospect of, that the general restimony, from such a nation as this, to the virtues of our unparalleled prodigy of a philanthropist, will bring in so magnificent a subscription as to enable you to erect his Statue on a column, of the Corinthian order, fluted, and of the dimensions at least of that beautiful one dug out of the ruins of the Temple of Peace, on which Pope Borghese, Paul the Fifth, erected a Statue, which is now standing at Rome, in front of the church of St. Maria Maggiore. I will suppose, further that there will be left an overplus, not only competent to the excellent idea of one of the most respectable charac∣ters in the world, a gentleman of Suffolk, of placing a bust of Mr. Howard in prisons, and houses of industry and correction, but like∣wise to the establishment of a considerable fund, to be called the <HI>How-ardian fund,</HI> placed in the public stocks, and there to accumulate (I hope for a long while) till Mr. Howard's death; and <HI>then</HI> the interest of it to be applied, by the <HI>Howardian committee,</HI> whoever they shall be, and however supplied as the members of it drop off (by acts of Par∣liament) either in aid of Mr. Howard's reform of prisons, or in that of the benevolent institution for the discharge of prisoners confined for small debts. This will be a collateral method of perpetuating his name, as efficacious as the principal one; as it must endure as long as the nation has either stocks or name. But more of this hereafter. I return to the placing of the statued column.</P>
<P>Now I take it for granted that the spot of all others that ought to be preferred would be that, if it could be found, which would natu∣rally
<PB N="35" REF="33"/>and necessarily induce the public to the daily, constant, common, and perpetual mention of <HI>Howard's Column;</HI> and by such means, in∣deed, <HI>semper honos nomenque suum laudesque manebunt,</HI> which is what you aim at, as well in the mouths of the million, where they otherwise would soon be lost, as in philanthropic hearts, where they will for ever live. For this purpose, Gentlemen, what think you of the spot, where now stands the Obelisk in St. George's Fields? The Obelisk is a name for ever necessarily in common use with all the world, in a variety of phrases, such as—You go by the <HI>Obelisk</HI>—You turn to the right or left at the <HI>Obelisk</HI>—It measures so many miles from the <HI>Obelisk,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c. Now, if in the place of that Obelisk (which has not long existed nei∣ther) were substituted <HI>Howard's Column,</HI> will not the name of it, in all similar phrases, be substituted too—You go by <HI>Howard's Column,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c.? To this, helps might be given by Road-acts, &amp;c. That the Obelisk would not be very readily given up, it would be injurious to the liberal magistrates of Surrey <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">With submission to the Writer of this letter, we believe the Obelisk to be the property of the Corporation of London. But from that opulent and benevolent Body, as well as from the Magistrates of Surrey, every species of assistance may of course be expected.</NOTE> to entertain a doubt; as they would instantly see that the purposes for which it was erected, for orna∣menting and lighting the spot, and as a term of measurement, would be not only preserved, but augmented and improved. <HI>Howard's Column,</HI> such as I can conceive it, and something like it I doubt not I shall have the happiness to see, there or elsewhere, would be much more highly ornamental than the Obelisk: eight square pillars, dividing the iron rails into as many compartments, might surround the Co∣lumn, and have inscribed on their outer sides as many measurements as you will; and from the tops of the pillars branch out an iron work, supporting each two lamps, and forming in all a ring, or <HI>gloriole,</HI> of sixteen lamps, with which the shrine of that god-like man, so much
<PB N="36" REF="34"/>more deserving it than any Saint, I beg to be understood as meaning any <HI>modern</HI> Saint, would be nightly lighted <HI>in saecula seculorum, Amen.</HI> —The trifling extra-expence of oil, as well as the repairs of the Co∣lumn for ever, to be defrayed out of the <HI>Howardian fund.</HI> This spot is what the French call an <HI>etcile.</HI> When thus enriched, what a bril∣liant star! And who knows what glorious consequences to our country its animating influence may produce!</P>
<P>Every Foreigner of Distinction enters the town' by Westminster Bridge, the passage to which from the Kentish road is now by the Obelisk, as having been found some yards nearer than the former way; and, it <HI>Howard's Column</HI> should occupy the spot, what Foreigner could pass it, by day or by night, without acquainting himself with the meaning of it, and consequently with the character of the man to whose honour it was erected? His character indeed is well known; and, when I say that, I say <HI>admired,</HI> and, I may add, <HI>envied to us,</HI> by all the present set of men in Europe, from the <HI>Sovereigns</HI> down to their lowest fubjects, who know any thing of the world—with whom, by the way, this nation will lose no credit by the magnificent exulta∣tion which it will express in this Monument of gratitude, for having had the honour to produce him.</P>
<P>I shall be much surprized, Gentlemen, if you should not receive, before the end of September, a subscription more than competent to, all the purposes of honouring Mr. Howard than have been here sug∣gested, if they should be approved; which I am far from presuming to flatter myself they will, as I expect to see much more judicious schemes proposed; but so very material an article, as that of the spot where the Statue should be placed, cannot too soon be discussed. Should you think it worthy, you may publish my letter if you please, as it may serve at least to sharpen better wits, perhaps at my expence, how much soever it may be itself.</P>

<HEAD>TO THE EDITOR.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are, I searce can think it, but am told—Yes, Sir, there are, they say, some gentlemen who, upon the subject of the excellent national design which is now on foot, object to the propriety, not of rendering a public honour to Mr. Howard in his life-time, for to that, I believe, no mortal can object, but to the propriety of rendering that public honour in a <HI>Statue;</HI> Statues, they say, relating to the pomp of success in war, and the havock of mankind. But I beg these gentlemens' pardon. Statues have in all ages been erected like∣wise, at the public expence, to men eminent in the arts of peace as well as war, for virtue, learning, and services performed. Augustus caused the Statues of all those Romans, who had eminently distinguished themselves in the arts of either peace or war, to be set up in the Curia, allotting to each profession its proper place. Thus Tacitus tells us, that the Statue of Hortensius was placed among the orators. Cato Censor had a Statue for being the most useful senator—the quality of senator is nothing to the purpose, as a citizen may be as useful, though he cannot be quite so mischievous out of the senate as in it—Lucius Minucius Augurinus, for having restored plenty to the city—and Marius Gratidianus for having only taught the marks by which adulterate coins was to be distinguished. Here then were Statues erected to <HI>Utility,</HI> but not joined, as in Mr. How∣ard's case, with the most transcendent philanthropy; for Cato Cen∣sor, I think it was, who, with a heart harder than the nether mill-stone, had the practice (imitated, I doubt not, as he was fa∣mous for his <HI>wise</HI> oeconomy, by many of those barbarous butchers of mankind) of sending his slaves, useless through age, to be starved to death upon a barren island. How happier for them to have been Mr.
<PB N="38" REF="36"/>Howard's horses <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Howard allots to his horses, grown old or infirm, a rich pasture to range in for their lives.</NOTE>! That this gentleman has been most useful, were it not so generally known, we might safely credit from a great master of eloquence, and equally renowned for information <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mr. Burke. See above, p. 29.</NOTE>, who said six years ago, that <Q>his labours and writings have done much to open the eyes and hearts of mankind; and that already the benesit of his labours was felt more or less in every country.</Q> That a much greater num∣ber of Statues have been erected to the corrupters and destroyers of the human species, as statesmen and warriors are so well called by the most illustrious literary character now living, in his letter recommend∣ing this design, than to such men as Mr. Howard (if the world hath ever looked upon his like), who, as he says, <Q>has been in the noblest and most unequivocal sense of the word their preserver,</Q> is most true. And if any one will cast his eye upon the names which <HI>flumi∣nis ritu feruntur,</HI> in their respective channels, on Priestley's inge∣nious biographical chart which now hangs before me, he will be convinced of the melancholy reason; as he will there behold those cor∣rupters and destroyers under the title of statesmen and warriors, sailing as it were securely along the stream of time, in every age, in large, thick, close, well-appointed squadrons, whilst the preservers, the friends, and soothers of mankind, <HI>qui vitam excolucre per artes, quique sui memores alios fecere merendo,</HI> appear but here and there one, like the dispersed remnants of the pious Trojan's fleet, thinly scattered, and scarce emerging on the surface of the watery waste. But, thank Hea∣ven, from the opening which the labours and writings of Mr. Howard and the progress of philosophy together, have given to the eyes and hearts of men, there is great room to hope that the condition of the world is about to mend, and that, convinced as it must be, that utility,
<PB N="39" REF="37"/>accompanied by virtue, has the truest greatness, we shall see it readier than it has been to render to virtuous utility its highest honours.</P>
<P>Of all descriptions of men, it is our judges and magistrates who must be the most sensible of the utility which Mr. Howard has been of to the world; and I make no doubt, Sir, but that we shall see the thing will be taken up by Grand Juries, and other public bodies of men, and that the example will run through the kingdom in such a manner as to make the Statue become voted, with classical propriety, to this our most <HI>virtuous and useful</HI> citizen, by his country in his provincial tribes.</P>
<P>But the feeling heart will not want the influence of patriotic wisdom and example to direct it to its own gratification, in delighting to honour delicately, in his absence, him by whom our nature is so highly ho∣noured, and the precepts of the Divine Teacher, who hath left us an example that we should do as he did, so well obeyed, that, after going about Europe for thirty years, he is now carried beyond the bounds of it, in the most glorious of all crusades, the sublime ardour of <HI>doing good.</HI></P>

<P>THE very laudable design, which I observe by the Gentleman's Magazine has been set on foot greatly, if not chiefly, through you, of handing down to posterity the unexampled philanthropy of Mr. HOW∣ARD, meets my sincere approbation; and, as I long since admired his conduct when he was Sheriff of Bedfordshire, I beg leave to express my attachment to his character, by adding five guineas to the subscrip∣tion for erecting a Statue to his unremitted exertions for the relief of misery and distress.</P>
<P>It was owing to his ideas, and the intercourse I had with him when Sheriff of Cornwall in the year 1771, that I conceived the design of constructing a Gaol, Bridewell, and Debtors-ward in this county.— It has since been carried into execution; and, I flatter myself, the cri∣minals, as well as the public, are greatly indebted to him for the re∣spective benefits resulting therefrom.

<P>AFTER contributing the trifle which accompanies this letter towards the grateful and generous plan of raising a memorial to my worthy Re∣lation (for such I have the honour to style him) Mr. HOWARD; I beg leave, with great deference to the gentlemen who compose the Com∣mittee, to offer a thought or two on the subject of their proposal.</P>
<P>Mr. HOWARD appears to me, from my own observation, and from all I have heard of him, to be modest, and diffident, to an extreme.— Vanity has no share in his composition.—His good actions spring from native benevolence alone, without a mixture of a wish for worldly ap∣plause.</P>
<P>To such a man, who shrinks from public approbation, will not the showy tribute intended to his merits be exquisitely painful?—Statues are not very usually erected, in these modern times, to any persons (crowned heads excepted) during their lives, more especially when the person so honoured resides chiefly near the proposed situation of this elegant memorial.—Should this excellently well-intended Monument give so much uneasiness to the person it commemorates, as to make him avoid the metropolis, which has hitherto been a conspicuous scene of his benevolence; would it not then in vain be wished that the execution of the plan had been deferred until his ideas on the subject were at least guessed at?</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="40"/>I will hazard one more question.—Supposing that the sums <HI>raised</HI> and <HI>to be raised</HI> for the Statue were to be employed—in alleviating the dis∣tress of prisoners—in rewarding and encouraging proper attendants on their souls and bodies—in liberating those confined for small debts— in short, in following up those plans for the welfare of the destitute part of mankind which Mr. HOWARD's life and actions have always meant to inculcate;—can there be a doubt of the superior pleasure which that Friend to mankind would feel, when compared with his sensation when he finds, on his return to Britain, an ostentatious token of gra∣titude, which can neither extend his fame, or aid the accomplishment of his designs?</P>
<P>It will give me sincere concern, should I find that my ideas on this subject should give offence to a set of gentlemen so well-intentioned, so liberally-minded, as the Committee to whom I address myself.—Their candour will, I hope, excuse a variation from their opinions, a variation in which I am by no means singular; since the same idea has struck many who have perused the papers published on this affair; and among these are some who seem to be well acquainted with the sentiments of my excellent Relation. I am, Gentlemen, with true respect, your de∣voted humble servant,</P>

<HEAD><HI>London, August</HI> 28, 1786. STATUE FOR MR. HOWARD, AND HOWARDIAN FUND FOR PRISON-CHARITIES AND REFORMS.</HEAD>
<P>MANY sincere Admirers of Mr. HOWARD, "THE FRIEND TO EV'RY CLIME, A PATRIOT OF THE WORLD," anxious that his transcendent Philanthropy may not wait for the tardy, and, as it should seem, almost unwilling gratitude, of posthumous acknowledgement from the Public, entertain a Hope, from a Hint thrown out in the "Gentleman's Magazine" for May, and so nobly improved upon in that for June, that (though he seeks not his reward from men) a STATUE, as one of the highest Earthly Honours, may be erected to him, to perpetuate the Memory of it, before he goes to be rewarded with Heavenly Honours, and during his Absence upon a God∣like Errand which carries him to Turkey, to try to restrain the Ravages of the Plague. And who knows not with how truly Christian a Spirit and undaunted Courage he, before, went about doing Good; how gloriously he has devoted a great Part of his Life and Property to repeated visits to most of those mansions of Misery and Infection, the Jails of Europe; and how many a weary Prisoner whom he came unto has been bound to bless him, for the Removal of at least some Horror, for the Alleviation of at least some Anguish, which with the Iron entered into his Soul, when it was cast down and disquieted within him! Those Persons therefore who, feeling like Men, Christians, and Britons, the exalted Merit which does so much Honour to their Nature, their Religion, and their Country, wish to avail themselves, that his Delicacy may not be hurt, of the humble Possessor's Absence for the Pleasure of expressing that Feeling, in the doing something towards crecting such a Monument of public Gratitude to <HI>Him,</HI> and of Encouragement to Virtue as heroic and sublime, if it be pos∣sible, in others, at the same time forwarding his favourite Charities and Reforms, are hereby invited, by the Committee of the Subscribers to this National Design, to send their Contributions to Messrs. R. and F. GOSLING, Bankers, Fleet-street; Messrs. MILDRED, MASTERMAN, and WALKER, Bankers, White Hart Court, Grace-church-street; Messrs. LANGSTONS, TOWGOODS, and AMORY, Bankers, Clement's-lane; Dr. LETTSOM, Basinghall-street; Mr. J. ROBSON, Bookseller, New Bond-street; or to Mr. J. NICHOLS, Printer, at Cicero's Head, Red-Lion Passage, Fleet-street; where the Committee at present meet, and will be glad of the Correspondence of any Friend to the design. They have the pleasure to say, that, in consequence of the liberal countenance of the Public, they have this day FUNDED FIVE HUNDRED POUNDS THREE PER∣CENT. CONSOLIDATED ANNUITIES, which will continue as a perpetual Fund appropriated to Prison-Charities.</P>
<P>{inverted ⁂} They are much obliged to many Correspondents, whose favours shall be adverted to in the Gentleman's Magazine for August; and return their best thanks for the very liberal notice taken of the Design, by the Printers not only of all the London Newspapers, but by those of almost every Country Town in England, whose Ex∣ample will, they trust, be followed by all the rest, and by those of Scotland and Ireland.</P>
