<L>AS ancient Heroes are renown'd in Song,</L>
<L>For rescuing Virtue from th'Oppressor's Wrong,</L>
<L>So shall thy Fame, who snatch'd this well-wrought Tale,</L>
<L>From Dulness' gloomy Pow'r, o'er Time prevail.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Long had these Scenes, wound up with dext'rous Art,</L>
<L>In spight of Reason, gain'd upon the Heart;</L>
<L>Thaw'd ev'ry frozen Fountain of the Eye,</L>
<L>We wept, 'till even Sorrow's self was dry;</L>
<L>Yet Judgment scorn'd what Passion had approv'd,</L>
<L>And the Head wonder'd, how the Heart was mov'd,</L>
<L>But, with a Fate revers'd, thy Work shall boast,</L>
<L>That soundest Judgments shall admire it most,</L>
<L>Cloath'd in the easy Grandeur of thy Lines,</L>
<L>The Story brightens, as the Diction shines.</L>
<L>Renew'd with Vigour as in Age 'tis grown,</L>
<L>The wond'ring Scene sees Beauties not it's own.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus, worn with Years, in <HI>Afric</HI>'s sultry Vales,</L>
<L>The crested Snake shifts off his tarnish'd Scales;</L>
<L>Assumes fresh Beauties, brighter than the old,</L>
<L>Of changing Colours, intermix'd with Gold:</L>
<L>Reburnish'd, basks beneath the scorching Ray,</L>
<L>Shines with new Glories in the Face of Day,</L>
<L><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arts fiercer Lightning from his brandish'd Tongue,</L>

<L>This rapid Fire, by cool Correctness rul'd,</L>
<L>And ev'ry learned Elegance, unschool'd?</L>
<L>Say, hath great <HI>Shakespear</HI>'s transmigrated Shade</L>

<L>OUR desp'rate Bard a bold Excursion tries,</L>
<L>Tho' Danger damp'd his Wing, he dar'd to rise;</L>
<L>From Hope, high rais'd, all glorious Actions spring;</L>
<L>'Tis hence that Heroes conquer, Poets sing.</L>
<L>Even he may feel the soul-exalting Fire,</L>
<L>Fame prompts the humblest Bosom to aspire.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Without a Guide this rash Attempt he made,</L>
<L>Without a Clue from Art, or Learning's Aid.</L>
<L>He takes a Theme where tend'rest Passions glow,</L>
<L>A Theme, your Grandsires felt with pleasing Woe,</L>
<L><HI>ESSEX'</HI> sad Tale he strives to cloath anew,</L>
<L>And hopes to place it in a stronger View.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Poets, like Painters, may, by equal Law,</L>
<L>The labour'd Piece from different Masters draw,</L>
<L>Perhaps improve the Plan, add Fire and Grace,</L>
<L>And strike th' impassion'd Soul through all the Face.</L>
<L>How far our Author has secur'd a Claim</L>
<L>To this exalted Palm, this wish'd-for Fame,</L>
<L>Your generous Sentiments will soon declare:</L>
<L>Humanity is ever prone to spare.</L>
<L>'Twere Baseness then your Candour to distrust;</L>
<L>A <HI>BRITISH</HI> Audience will, at least, be just.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A flattering Truth he fearful must confess,</L>
<L>His sanguine Friends made Promise of Success;</L>
<L>But that, he fears, their ardent Wishes wrought,</L>
<L>Since partial Favour seldom sees a Fault.</L>
<L>Then bear, like patient Friends, this first Essay,</L>
<L>His next shall thank you in a nobler Way.</L>

<L>With earnest Suit, and warm Entreaty, begg'd her,</L>

<HEAD>EPILOGUE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By an Unknown Hand. Spoken by Mrs. CIBBER.</BYLINE>
<SP>
<L>NEWS! News! good Folks, rare News, and you shall know it—</L>
<L>I've got Intelligence about our Poet!</L>
<L>Who do you think be is?—You'll never guess;</L>
<L>An <HI>IRISH BRICKLAYER,</HI> neither more or less.</L>
<L>And now the Secret's out, you cannot wonder,</L>
<L>That in commencing Bard he made a Blunder.</L>
<L>Has be not left the Better for the Worse,</L>
<L>In quitting Solid Brick for empty Verse?</L>
<L>Can he believe th' Example of <HI>Old Ben,</HI></L>
<L>Who chang'd (like him) the Trowel for the Pen,</L>
<L>Will in his Favour move your Critic Bowels?</L>
<L>You rather wish, most Poct's Pons were Trowels,</L>
<L>Our Man is honest, sensible, and plain,</L>
<L>Nor has the Poet made him pert, or vain:</L>
<L>No Beau, no Courtier, nor conceited Youth;</L>
<L>But then so rude, <HI>he always speaks the Truth:</HI></L>
<L>I told him he must flatter, learn Address,</L>
<L>And gain the Heart of some rich Patroness:</L>
<L>'Tis she, said I, your Labours will reward,</L>
<L>If you but join the Bricklay'r with the Bard;</L>
<L>As thus—Should she be old and worse for Wear,</L>
<L>You must new-<HI>case</HI> her, <HI>front</HI> her and <HI>repair;</HI></L>
<L>If crack'd in Fame, as scarce to bear a Touch,</L>
<L>You cannot use your <HI>Trowel</HI> then too much;</L>
<L><PB REF="70"/>
In short, whate'er her Morals, Age or Station,</L>
<L><HI>Plaister</HI> and <HI>white-wash</HI> in your Dedication.</L>
<L>Thus I advis'd—but he detests the Plan:</L>
<L>What can be done with such a simple Man?</L>
<L>A Poet's nothing worth and nought availing,</L>
<L>Unless he'll furnish, where there is a Failing.</L>
<L>Authors in these good Times are made and us'd,</L>
<L>To grant those Favours Nature has refus'd.</L>
<L>If he won't <HI>fib,</HI> what Bounty can be crave?</L>
<L>We pay for what we want, not what we have.—</L>
<L>Nay tho' of every <HI>Blessing</HI> we have store,</L>
<L>Our Sex will always wish—a little more.—</L>
<L>If he'll not bend his Heart to this his Duty,</L>
<L>And sell (to who will buy) Wit, Honour, Beauty;</L>
<L>The Bricklay'r still for him the proper Trade is,</L>
<L>Too rough to deal with Gentlemen and Ladies.—</L>
<L>In short—they'll all avoid him and neglect him,</L>
<L>Unless that you his <HI>Patrons</HI> will protect him.</L>
