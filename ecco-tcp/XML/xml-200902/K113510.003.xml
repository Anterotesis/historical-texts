<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE sad duty of publishing the posthumous works of a revered Parent having devolved on me, I now present the Public with two volumes of the continuation of the "OUTLINES OF THE GLOBE," which comprehend a view of the interesting countries of China, Japan, New Holland, and the Archipelago of the Indian Ocean.</P>
<P>As an editor, my chief care has been to transcribe with accuracy from the original manuscript. The finishing touch of the master may be wanting; but the hand, alas! which gave the glowing tint is now cold, and who shall dare to usurp the pencil! Some trifling additions, dis∣tinguished by an initial, have been made by myself; and to <HI>John Latham,</HI> Esquire, I am indebted for an augmentation to the catalogue of Birds of China, and of New Holland.
<PB N="vi" REF="4"/>An objection may be made by some, that no plates adorn these volumes—engravings, except of novel objects, or really illustrative, and such, notwithstanding much exertion, it was not my good fortune to procure, tend little to the value of a work of science. Two maps, presumed more requisite, have been constructed from the best materials.</P>
<P>The biography of the valued Author of the following sheets, having been given by himself in his "Literary Life," to the commencement of the year 1793, little remains for me to add. To that period his health and felicity had ex∣perienced little interruption; the illness of an amiable daughter then began to embitter his days, and, after the most unremitting attention that parental fondness could dictate, he felt the cruel pang of separation, on the first of May 1794; this shock his spirits never completely recovered. In the April of the ensuing year, the patella of the knee snap∣ped, while descending a flight of steps, an accident which confined him long to his room, yet, notwithstanding his advanced age, and the bones never again reuniting, he re∣covered
<PB N="vii" REF="5"/>sufficiently not only to walk without difficulty, but to pursue his usual exercise on horseback.</P>
<P>The year 1796 gave to the world his "Account of the parishes of Whitford and Holywell." The infirmities of nature now began to shew themselves more evidently. The loss of a friend and neighbor, the worthy Sir <HI>Roger Mostyn,</HI> the subsequent distractions of the county of Flint by jarring politics, the melancholy situation of public affairs, the progress of Gallic barbarism, which threatened to overturn all institutions social and sacred, operated too forcibly on a mind of the acutest feeling and most exquisite sensibility. Mental agitation affected the corporeal system; a difficulty of breathing, a cough, and other pulmonary affections in∣duced him to apply for medical aid, and he received from his friend Dr. <HI>Haygarth,</HI> then resident at Chester, all the assistance that art could give. Considerable discharges of blood from the nose increased the alarming symptoms; still the energy of his mind sustained itself; he continued his literary pursuits, and employed his leisure hours, during the
<PB N="viii" REF="6"/>greatest part of 1797, in preparing for the press, and render∣ing as perfect as possible, his interesting "VIEW OF HIN∣DOOSTAN," which was published early in the following year. OEdematous swellings in the legs announced the fatal cause of his disease; but to expatiate more minutely on the sad catalogue of human evils might be irksome; suffice it then to say, that he bore their trial with fortitude and resignation; a natural strength of constitution, aided by a life of uni∣form temperance, enabled him long to struggle against in∣firmity. The progress of the disorder becoming more rapid, towards the close of October he collected his nearest rela∣tives, and received with them the mysterious seal of our Redemption; conscious of his approaching end, his eye beamed with hope, tempered by the most serene and digni∣fied resignation; combining charity with devotion, he observed, that the ceremony would be incomplete indeed, were it not accompanied by an act of beneficence to the poor. This was the last duty of religion he performed; his life had been a preparation for the aweful conclusion.
<PB N="ix" REF="7"/>Though soon after reduced to the inability of moving, and suffering much, he continued to share the conversation of his friends and relations, except during the extreme pressure of pain, or when opiates, employed to procure a disturbed sleep, or relieve the body from a few pangs, produced their powerful effect, and sacrificed the reasoning powers and the nobler faculties of the soul. On the 16th of December 1798, the powers of nature were exhausted, and the vene∣rated author of my being expired without a groan!</P>
<P>The pen of a son may not be calculated to record the character of an affectionate and beloved parent; the bias of natural affection may operate too forcibly, yet the silence of the person most intimately acquainted with the various virtues of <HI>Thomas Pennant,</HI> would justly draw down the reproach of ingratitude.</P>
<P>His religious principles were pure and fervent, yet exempt from bigotry; though firmly attached to the established church, he, by his writings and conduct, conciliated the esteem of those of a different persuasion. A steady
<PB N="x" REF="8"/>friend to our excellent constitution, he ever labored to preserve it entire; this induced him to petition for the reform of some abuses during the administration of Lord <HI>North,</HI> at a period when the influence of the crown was supposed to have exceeded its due bounds; this brought him forward in later times, with additional energy, to resist the democratic spirit, which menaced tenfold evils. The duties of a magistrate he exercised with candor, with a temperate yet zealous warmth to protect the oppressed. His benevolence to the poor was unbounded, his repeated exertions to relieve the wants of a populous neighbourhood, by the importation of corn, in times of scarcity, were truly munificent. Temperate in diet, he enjoyed the fruits of abstinence, and, until a few years previous to his decease, possessed an unusual share of health and vigor. His conver∣sation was lively, replete with instruction, and brilliant with sallies of true humour; yet too great sensiblity at times lowered his natural flow of spirits, and occasioned severe dejection.</P>
<P><PB N="xi" REF="9"/>Of his literary character the public is the impartial judge, and that public not only in this, but in foreign countries has fixed on it the stamp of approbation. Blessed with a me∣mory the most retentive, his powers of composition were rapid; his works were generally printed, as they flowed from the pen, with little or no correction, hence, some in∣accuracies may be expected, but their numbers are trifling.</P>
<P>Such, candid Reader! is the true but imperfect sketch of the character of a man who to superior talents united the utmost goodness of heart.</P>
<P>Accept, sainted spirit! this unavailing tribute of filial duty! May the example of thy virtues stimulate my exer∣tions! May my latter end resemble thine!</P>

<HEAD>INDIA EXTRA GANGEM.</HEAD>
<P>I NOW enter on that portion of <HI>India</HI> which is distinguished by the name of <HI>India</HI> beyond the <HI>Ganges.</HI> The distinction is comparatively modern, being known to the antients in an imperfect manner. Here and there are scattered a few names, which they could only have collected from the <HI>Indian</HI> navi∣gators; but I shall mention in course any other lights which I discover they might have received.</P>
<P>ADJOINING to <HI>Chittigong</HI> is the kingdom of <HI>Aracan,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">KINGDOM OF ARACAN.</NOTE> which extends along the bay of <HI>Bengal</HI> about two hundred miles in a south-eastern direction. According to Mr. <HI>Rennel</HI>'s map, a chain of mountains, beginning in the southern part of <HI>Chittigong</HI> skirts the sea the whole length of this kingdom, as well as that of <HI>Ava,</HI> to within a few leagues of <HI>Cape Negrais.</HI> The whole tract is infested to a very great degree with elephants and beasts of prey. The topography of this country is very obscure. The mouth of the river <HI>Aracan,</HI> the <HI>Tocosannae</HI> of <HI>Ptolemy,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">RIVER.</NOTE> is placed in Lat. 20° 12′. M. <HI>D'Anville</HI> gives its whole course. Mr. <HI>Rennel,</HI> more cautious, and, perhaps, conscious of the uncertainty, only
<PB N="2" REF="18"/>delineates a small part,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">ARACAN.</NOTE> or from the capital, <HI>Aracan,</HI> to the sea. From <HI>Aracan,</HI> as high as Lat. 26°, with the exception of a small portion between <HI>Malaac</HI> and <HI>Munnypour,</HI> where it is traversed by the great communication from <HI>Ava</HI> to the northern parts of <HI>Bengal,</HI> it is marked with a dotted line; from that point the river is distinguished by a certain course, which is continued northward, in the kingdom of <HI>Thibet,</HI> as high as Lat. 30° 10′. All the great tract it passes through is level, which makes it liable to annual inundations, from the same causes as affect the <HI>Bengal</HI> and other of the <HI>Indian</HI> plains. The tides which run up this river are very high; they come in with a great bore, and rise from fifteen to twenty feet, according to the influence of the moon.</P>
<P>THERE is six fathom water, according to Mr. <HI>Ovington</HI>'s ac∣count, at the entrance of the river, and twenty farther up, so that it forms a noble harbour. From the mouth to the capital is about fifty miles; most of the way deliciously bounded by woods or plantations, animated by the gambols of the monkey tribe, or the gay flights of numbers of peacocks. The city of <HI>Aracan</HI> is seated most singularly, in a valley surrounded with vast and craggy mountains. These are assisted by art, so as to prove the most substantial fortifications. The entrances are cut through the solid rock, as are the gates of the city. The precipitous face of the mountains serves for walls; besides these, it has a citadel, and other artificial defences. The city is said to be fifteen miles in circumference, and to contain a hundred and sixty thousand inhabitants. The regal palace is very magnificent, and highly adorned and enriched with works of massive gold.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="19"/>IN my
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Outlines of the Globe, vol. ii. p. 372.</NOTE> account of <HI>Chittigong,</HI> in the preceding volume, I have related the share this kingdom took in the affairs of <HI>Hindoostan,</HI> by reason of the support it gave the <HI>Portuguese</HI> pirates. I shall now take notice of a very remarkable event which befel <HI>Aracan,</HI> the result of the misfortunes of <HI>Sultan Sujah,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">OF SULTAN SULJAH.</NOTE> the second son of the emperor <HI>Shah Jehan,</HI> and the unfortunate brother of that suc∣cessful hypocrite <HI>Aurengzebe.</HI> After <HI>Sujah</HI> had long made head against the usurper, he was at length obliged to retire from his fastness near <HI>Monghier</HI> to <HI>Dacca,</HI> and from thence to the king∣dom of <HI>Aracan.</HI> He had previously sent his son to the king of the country, to implore his protection. This was imme∣diately promised, and the unhappy prince embarked with his whole family on board the vessels of the <HI>Portuguese</HI> pirates, set∣tled in the mouths of the <HI>Ganges,</HI> intending to profit of the favor of the infidel monarch, till he could procure a ship to convey him to the holy city of <HI>Mecca.</HI> From thence he in∣tended to go to the courts of <HI>Turky</HI> or <HI>Persia,</HI> in hopes of an asylum in one or other of the dominions of those mighty poten∣tates. <HI>Sujah</HI> is said soon to have discovered the perfidy of his royal host, who had entered into a treaty with the General of <HI>Aurengzebe,</HI> to deliver into his hands, for a sum of money, the fugitive sultan. This came to the ears of that prince, who rashly determined on revenge. He entered into a conspiracy against the <HI>Aracan</HI> monarch, gained over a certain number of <HI>Maho∣metans</HI> resident in the country, and with those, and the few who were left of his train, resolved to force his way into the palace, to kill the king, and cause himself to be proclamed sovereign.
<PB N="4" REF="20"/>All this might have been executed,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">ARACAN.</NOTE> had not the design been dis∣covered. The unhappy <HI>Sujah</HI> attempted to escape towards <HI>Pegu;</HI> he was soon overtaken. His son, sultan <HI>Banque,</HI> defended him∣self with a courage worthy of his birth, till overpowered with numbers, and fainting under his wounds, he was seized, and with his two little brothers, his sisters, and his mother, car∣ried away. As to <HI>Sujah,</HI> he, with one woman, an eunuch, and two other persons, in ascending a mountain, was knocked down with a stone by his pursuers. The eunuch bound up his wounded head with a turban, and they both escaped into the woods. Many relations were spread respecting this event. In general he was supposed to have died either famished with hunger, or fallen a prey to wild beasts. Mr. <HI>Dalrymple</HI> had picked up a story, that <HI>Sujah</HI> escaped to <HI>Soolo,</HI> an isle between that of <HI>Borneo</HI> and <HI>Magindanao,</HI> where he long led an eremitical life; that he died there, and that a tomb was erected over his grave, to this day an object of veneration with the <HI>Mahometans.</HI></P>
<P>THE tragical relation does not end here. Sultan <HI>Banque,</HI> and other fugitives who were brought back, were at first treated with a tolerable degree of lenity; the king even took to wife one of <HI>Sujah</HI>'s daughters. This did not prevent <HI>Banque</HI> and his companions from entering into another conspiracy, which was detected. The king of <HI>Aracan</HI> determined to root out this ill∣fated family; he caused the heads of the men to be cut off with blunt axes, the women to be immured, and starved to death; the lady alone whom he had honored with his bed was saved.</P>
<P>THE great quantity of gold and diamonds which had been brought into the country by <HI>Sujah,</HI> proved the cause of dreadful
<PB N="5" REF="21"/>wars between the two sons of the king of <HI>Aracan,</HI> who suc∣ceeded him in 1690; they quarrelled about the division of the treasure, and never ceased from contesting the prize till both the competitors were destroyed. Many of the diamonds (as is supposed) were afterwards sold to the <HI>Dutch,</HI> who happened to touch at <HI>Aracan,</HI> at very low prices, by reason of the ignorance of the possessors.</P>
<P>THE next kingdom is that of <HI>Ava.</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">KINGDOM OF AVA.</NOTE> I shall comprehend in it three; that of <HI>Ava</HI> proper, <HI>Buraghmah,</HI> or, as it is vulgarly called, <HI>Burmah,</HI> and <HI>Pegu.</HI> They once formed so many inde∣pendent states, governed by their respective monarchs; but are now by conquest consolidated into one, being subdued by the king of <HI>Burmagh.</HI> His dominions extend from the province of <HI>Yunan,</HI> in <HI>China,</HI> as far south as the mouths of the <HI>Ava,</HI> a tract of eight hundred miles. The standard of <HI>Mahomet</HI> was never erected in these kingdoms; all the inhabitants are rank idolaters; their mode of worship and their rites agree in many points with those of the <HI>Hindoos,</HI> and they allow the doctrine of transmigra∣tion. Their pagodas, and those of <HI>Pegu,</HI> very much resemble in form that of a bell tent. The more northern part is the kingdom of <HI>Burmagh;</HI> that of <HI>Meckly,</HI> tributary to it, forms on our maps a large vacant space to the west, divided by a vast chain of mountains from <HI>Silhet</HI> and <HI>Tipera. Roshuan,</HI> another void, is to the south of <HI>Meckly.</HI> The kingdom of <HI>Aracan</HI> sepa∣rates <HI>Burmagh,</HI> for a considerable extent, from the eastern part of the bay of <HI>Bengal.</HI> The coast of <HI>Ava</HI> succeeds, and runs, washed by the sea, as far as <HI>Cape Negrais,</HI> an extent of above two hundred miles.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="22"/>THE great river <HI>Ava</HI> takes its rise far beyond the province of <HI>Yunan,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">RIVER AVA.</NOTE> in <HI>China,</HI> and, as is supposed, in <HI>Thibet.</HI> The <HI>Chinese</HI> call it <HI>Hou-kian.</HI> I am uncertain where it becomes navigable, possibly at the last custom-house in the <HI>Chinese</HI> dominions; at least we find, that four people of that nation, with some others, em∣barked there on a voyage made in the last century down that river. We have an account of it in vol. vii. 123, of the <HI>Universal History.</HI> It is described, even at the custom-house, as a large and rapid river. They were twenty days in sailing to the city of <HI>Ava,</HI> and a month more from thence to <HI>Pegu.</HI> Below the capital of the kingdom, the vessels which navigate this mighty river are said to be as large as our biggest ships, without sail, but the planks have neither peg or nail to fasten them; they seem to be sewed, like the Arabian vessels, which will be described in vol. of this work.</P>
<P>MR. DALRYMPLE, in p. 112 of his useful Repertory, says, he is assured, that the river passes through a great lake, not far above the city of <HI>Ava.</HI> This lake, in the old maps, such as <HI>Speed</HI>'s,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">LAKE OF CHIAMAY.</NOTE> is called <HI>Chiamay,</HI> and it is supposed that the rivers of <HI>Siam,</HI> and possibly of <HI>Aracan, Chittigong,</HI> and some others, flow out of it. The river is described as difficult of navigation, by reason of ripplings and overfalls; and its water, during the inundations, very cold, occasioned by the snowy mountains from whence it flows.</P>
<P>THE borders of the <HI>Ava,</HI> after it enters <HI>Burmagh,</HI> are in some parts flat, in others hilly, but in none so low as to be over∣flowed. The neighbouring grounds are replete with saltpetre, and quantities of common salt are procured by lixiviation from
<PB N="7" REF="23"/>a black earth which abounds in this district. It is now called the <HI>Irabathy. Munchaboo,</HI> the royal residence of the king of <HI>Bur∣magh,</HI> stands about twelve miles from the western bank, in Lat. 23° 38′, a walled town, of a square form, containing four thou∣sand families.</P>
<P><HI>Ava,</HI> the capital of the kingdom of the same name,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">AVA CITY.</NOTE> is seated in Lat. 21° 48′, on the eastern bank of the river, about 38 miles below <HI>Munchaboo.</HI> It is a very large city, built of wood, the streets strait, and planted on each side with trees. The king's palace alone is of stone, but mean in its architecture. It was in the sixteenth century prodigiously populous, but was laid waste by the king of <HI>Pegu</HI> in the most savage manner. <HI>Purchas</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. ii. 1728.</NOTE> gives the horrible relation. The jewellers of <HI>Europe</HI> visited it in the same century, for the sake of its rich gems. At present <HI>Ava</HI> is in a most ruinous state, and does not contain above a thousand families. The kingdom produces sapphires and rubies of the highest quality. Mention is made of its rich mines of copper, lead, and silver. Other provinces are rich in gold.</P>
<P>FROM the city the river assumes the same name of <HI>Ava,</HI> takes a small curvature from thence towards the west, and the channel becomes full of isles. Near <HI>Pegongmew,</HI> a town seated in a sterile sandy country, and which, from the remains of numerous pa∣godas, seems formerly to have been a place of importance, the <HI>Ava</HI> takes a more southerly course. Between Lat. 20° and 19° north,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">TEEK WOODS.</NOTE> the western side is filled with an immense forest of teek trees, which is said to produce the best timber of any in <HI>India;</HI> it is floated down the river, and is a considerable article of com∣merce.
<PB N="8" REF="24"/><HI>Prone,</HI> once enclosed with fortifications, lies on the left bank, and is one of the principal trading towns on its course; the environs are extremely fertile.</P>
<P>AT <HI>Lundsey,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">LUNDSEY.</NOTE> a town seated on the eastern bank, in Latitude 18° 30′, begins a rich, fat soil, formed by the mud brought down by the great annual inundations which this river is subject to, like the <HI>Ganges. Lundsey</HI> is distant a hundred and eighty miles from the sea. The <HI>Delta</HI> of the <HI>Ava</HI> begins in about Lat. 18°, and extends nearly a hundred and forty miles before it reaches the southern extremity; the base, or the lower part, facing the sea, is about two hundred miles; all the upper part of the <HI>Delta</HI> is clear land; the lower seems filled with wood, and divided by a number of channels into islands, like the <HI>Sunderbund</HI> of the <HI>Ganges.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ptolemy</HI> calls the river <HI>Ava, Sabaracus.</HI> That able geographer <HI>D'Anville</HI> mistakes it for the <HI>Burrampooter,</HI> and accordingly we find it under that name in his maps. The error is venial, for he did not live to the time of our <HI>Rennel.</HI></P>
<P>I SHALL now resume the coasts from the borders of <HI>Chitti∣gong.</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">COASTS.</NOTE> The country abounds with timber, and the woods with all sorts of animals for food, such as buffaloes, deer, and wild hogs. Here and there a few isles are dispersed along the shore; some in groups,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">ISLES.</NOTE> others single, or few together. The isles are <HI>St. Martin</HI>'s, not far above the mouth of <HI>Aracan</HI> river; the <HI>Oyster</HI> islands nearly opposite; and the <HI>Bolongo,</HI> a very little to it's south.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHEDUBAH ISLE.</NOTE> <HI>Chedubah,</HI> a large island in about Lat. 18° 30′, is sup∣posed to be the <HI>Bazacuta</HI> of <HI>Ptolemy,</HI> remarkable, says he, for the quantity of shells; he adds, that the inhabitants were called
<PB N="9" REF="25"/><HI>Agmatae,</HI> and that they went naked. The <HI>Sada Civitas</HI> is placed on the coast of <HI>Ava</HI> by M. <HI>D'Anville,</HI> in Lat. 18°. We are little acquainted with the country, but that able geographer disco∣vers it to have been a place still known by the name of <HI>Sadoa.</HI> Near it was the <HI>Sadus Fluvius. Berabonna</HI> was another town of <HI>Ptolemy</HI>'s, seated on the same coast, in Lat. 16° 30′, now called <HI>Barabon;</HI> and at the extremity of the southern side of <HI>Ava</HI> is <HI>Cape Negrais,</HI> in about Lat. 16°,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">CAPE NEGRAIS.</NOTE> the antient <HI>Promontorium Te∣mula.</HI> From Mr. <HI>Baker</HI>'s survey, in Mr. <HI>Dalrymple</HI>'s collection, it appears to be lofty, and in part very precipitous. The isle of <HI>Negrais</HI> and another, both off the mouth of the river, form within them a noble harbor, secure from all winds. The <HI>En∣glish,</HI> of late years, wished to six here a settlement. The country is incredibly fertile in rice, and might have proved a fine re∣source to the <HI>Coromandel</HI> coast, and even to <HI>Bengal,</HI> in times of scarcity, exclusive of the advantages to be derived from the har∣bor in time of war. As to rice, it is sold here at twelve pagodas a garce; whereas in <HI>Coromandel</HI> it is generally above thirty, and sometimes even eighty a garce.</P>
<P>THE kingdom of <HI>Pegu</HI> begins at this cape;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">PEGU.</NOTE> the coast turns then suddenly to the east, and extends above two hundred miles, inclining, after some way, slightly to the north, as far as the river of <HI>Martaban,</HI> the boundary between <HI>Pegu</HI> and the province of <HI>Martaban,</HI> which adjoins to the kingdom of <HI>Siam. Pegu</HI> is extremely narrow at the part next to <HI>Cape Negrais;</HI> but it widens quickly, so as to take in the whole <HI>Delta</HI> of the <HI>Ava,</HI> and stretches north as high as Lat. 19°. In the maps the coast of <HI>Ava</HI> is comprehended in the kingdom of <HI>Pegu.</HI> We know so little of these
<PB N="10" REF="26"/>countries, of their revolutions and contra-revolutions, that we dare not deny our assent to, or controvert the relations of writers.</P>
<P>THE great branch of the <HI>Delta</HI> is immediately to the east of <HI>Cape Negrais.</HI> It is called the <HI>Persaim</HI> river, from a town seated about seventy miles from the sea, on its eastern banks. In 1758 we had a factory on the opposite side. The channel is very wide and deep, having most of the way six and seven fathoms of water. On each side are navigable canals, that probably insulate part of the flat country to the east and to the west. On the eastern part there is an inland communication from this river quite to that of <HI>Pegu,</HI> or the <HI>Siriam</HI> river, as there is through the <HI>Sunderbunds</HI> of <HI>Bengal.</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">ISLE OF NE∣GRAIS.</NOTE> <HI>Negrais</HI> isle, marshy and wooded, lies just within the entrance; and on the outside is <HI>Diamond</HI> isle, small, and surrounded with rocks. Immediately before the front of the whole <HI>Delta</HI> are banks of mud or sand, of great extent, formed by the waters of the <HI>Ava</HI> depositing their foul load before the mouths of the several discharges. The <HI>Marcura Metropolis</HI> of <HI>Ptolemy</HI> stood in about the middle of the <HI>Delta,</HI> and must have had its navigable approach. I do not know that any of the discharges are at present useful in navigation, like the channels between the islands of the <HI>Sunderbunds,</HI> till we reach the entrance of that which leads to the town of <HI>Siriam.</HI> This, known by the name of the <HI>Siriam,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">SIRIAM.</NOTE> is a branch of the river of <HI>Pegu,</HI> and contributes to form another <HI>Delta.</HI> The town is about thirty miles from the entrance; near it are factories, be∣longing to the <HI>French, English,</HI> and <HI>Dutch. Raynal</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hist. of Europ. Set. vol. ii. p. 145.</NOTE> says, that the <HI>Armenians</HI> carry on a great trade in topazes, sapphires, ame∣thysts,
<PB N="11" REF="27"/>and rubies. The river was known to <HI>Ptolemy</HI> by the title of <HI>Besynga,</HI> and gave its name to the modern river of <HI>Pegu.</HI></P>
<P>THE other exports of <HI>Pegu</HI> are teek timber, elephants, ivory,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">EXPORTS.</NOTE> bees-wax, lac, iron, tin, indigo, oil from different woods, oil of earth, or <HI>Naptha,</HI> and of fish. Here are mines of gold and silver, but neither of these are worked. The iron is native, and found in masses of fifteen or twenty pounds weight, and ready for the ma∣nufacturer; also plenty of sulphur and saltpetre, but the exporta∣tion of the last is most strictly prohibited. Rice is cultivated in great abundance in the low lands of the country, but no atten∣tion is paid to any sort of manufactures, except that of cotton, for home consumption.</P>
<P>I MAY observe,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">BEES.</NOTE> that the bees of the torrid zone are the same with the <HI>European,</HI> there being only one species producing honey, which is the <HI>Apis Mellifica.</HI> No attempts are made, either in <HI>India</HI> or the hotter parts of <HI>Africa,</HI> to hive these admirable and useful insects; they inhabit the hollows of trees, from which their trea∣sures are taken.</P>
<P>LAC is the production of another insect, a species of <HI>Chermes,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">LAC.</NOTE> undescribed by <HI>Linnaeus.</HI> Doctor <HI>Roxburgh,</HI> a naturalist now rising in <HI>Hindoostan,</HI> gives us an account of its operations, in the Philosophical Transactions
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. lxxxi. p. 228. tab. vi.</NOTE>, under the name of <HI>Chermes Lacca.</HI> This, like the bee, forms cells, pentagons, hexagons, and irregular squares, which, at <HI>Samulcotta,</HI> in <HI>Orixa,</HI> the Doctor's residence, are affixed to the branches of the <HI>Mimosa Cinerea,</HI> the <HI>Mimosa Glauca</HI> of <HI>Koenig,</HI> and a new species called by the <HI>Gentoos, Conda Corinda.</HI> The insects are very small; they
<PB N="12" REF="28"/>first appear issuing out of the cells six-legged and wingless, and are amazingly active and lively; each cell contains about a hundred; the eggs they proceed from are lodged in the cells in a deep-red liquor. These are the females. The males are winged, and are not in proportion to the females more than one to five thousand, but they are four or five times their size. The eggs, and the liquor they are lodged in, give a most beautiful red. Doctor <HI>Roxburgh</HI> acknowleges, that the subject from which the materials of the cells is collected is as yet unknown.</P>
<P>LAC is brought over to <HI>Europe</HI> in three forms; adhering to the sticks, with the cells and insects; prepared in form of cakes; or in small grains, or seed <HI>lac,</HI> which is the insect advanced into a <HI>pupa</HI> state. This drug was once used in medicine, in disorders of the gums, proceeding from colds or scorbutic habits; but the uses are now confined to the making of sealing wax, or for dying. <HI>Gerard</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 1534.</NOTE> gives a figure of a stick of the tree, and the <HI>lac</HI> adhering, and supposes it to be the <HI>Luchs</HI> of <HI>Avicen,</HI> the <HI>Cancamum</HI> of <HI>Dioscorides.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Pegu</HI> imports from <HI>Bengal</HI> great quantities of <HI>Indian</HI> goods,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">IMPORTS.</NOTE> and some <HI>European,</HI> especially hats. The coco palm does not grow in <HI>Pegu,</HI> the nut is therefore a considerable import. <HI>Dam∣pier</HI> shipped eleven thousand, and five or six hundred pounds weight of sugar, as presents for the king.</P>
<P>THE river of <HI>Pegu</HI> arises in the province of <HI>Yunan,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">RIVER OF PEGU.</NOTE> in <HI>China,</HI> passes through the upper part of the kingdom of <HI>Siam,</HI> and forces its way through a great chain of mountains in about Lat. 20° 32′, which run from north to east, dividing <HI>Siam</HI> from <HI>Pegu;</HI> here it assumes the name of that kingdom.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">CITY.</NOTE> The capital city
<PB N="13" REF="29"/>stands on the eastern bank, in about Lat. 18° 8′. In its pro∣sperity it consisted of two parts, the old and the new; the last was the royal residence, and completed about the year 1567, by <HI>Man∣daragri,</HI> the second <HI>Burmagh</HI> king. A tyrant monarch arose, who oppressed his subjects to such a degree, as to encourage the neighboring princes to invade his dominions, and in 1596, he was besieged by them in his capital. The <HI>Portuguese,</HI> in con∣junction with certain Turks, caused the siege to be raised, but out of a hundred and fifty thousand inhabitants, only thirty thousand were left, all the others perished, either by the sword or famine; it had at that time three thousand cannon for its de∣fence, of which one thousand were brass. The kings of <HI>Aracan</HI> and <HI>Tangu</HI> took advantage of his distress, the city was again be∣sieged, surrendered to the latter, and the unfortunate monarch, and his whole family, put to death by order of his own sister, queen to the victorious king; the place was foon deserted, and the seat of empire transferred to <HI>Ava.</HI> The city of <HI>Pegu</HI> was of vast size, a regular square, with four grand streets leading to four gates, and being seated on a plain, a person at the center could see them all at once, though the city was a mile each way. The houses were built with bamboo; it was surrounded with walls, and a deep wet ditch, stocked with crocodiles,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">CROCODILES.</NOTE> to prevent people attempting to get in or out of the city by swimming or wading.</P>
<P>THE bore, or head wave of the tide,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">BORE, OR HEAD WAVE.</NOTE> which runs up this river is of amazing violence and rapidity; people who have the misfor∣tune of being shipwrecked on the banks near the shore, at low water or ebb of tide, are obliged to seek the land with all possible speed, for fear lest they should be swept away. On its entering
<PB N="14" REF="30"/>the channels and the mouths of rivers, the noise is most tre∣mendous. The bore is said to be sixteen feet high; the barks which run up the <HI>Pegu</HI> river, are carried with the rapidity of an arrow out of a bow. If they cannot finish their voyage in a tide, they anchor on some of the numerous sand banks with which the river is filled. The expansion of the tide on those elevated parts lessens the danger; as soon as the barks begin to be lifted up, they prepare for their voyage. At a certain time the mariners loosen their anchors, and are carried on as I describe. If they, or even the largest ships, lay in the channel, they would certainly be overset, and the crew and the cargo at once over∣whelmed in the wave; for this reason, large ships seldom ven∣ture to navigate this river, but discharge their lading at <HI>Siriam,</HI> from whence it was wont to be conveyed to <HI>Pegu</HI> in barks.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Portuguese</HI> very soon got considerable interest in this country, but by their profligate conduct were expelled by the reigning monarch.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">SYLVEIRA, HIS SAD FATE.</NOTE> One <HI>Thomas Sylveira</HI> had by his valor done considerable service to the king in the <HI>Siamese</HI> wars; he became a prime favorite, had his state elephant and body-guard allowed; till one day passing through the streets, and hearing the mirth of nuptial merriment in a burgher's house, stopped at the door, and understanding that the bride was a virgin of uncom∣mon beauty, requested a sight of her; the bridegroom, thinking it an extraordinary honor, brought her to the side of <HI>Sylveira</HI>'s elephant; the russian caused her to be seized, and carried to his house. The unhappy bridegroom, unable to sustain his loss, cut his throat; the relations rent their cloaths, and ran through the streets, appealing to their gods and monarch for revenge. The king heard the complaint, caused <HI>Sylveira</HI> to be seized, and
<PB N="15" REF="31"/>to be dragged at the foot of an elephant through the streets till neither skin or flesh were left on his bones, and all the <HI>Portu∣guese</HI> in <HI>Pegu,</HI> except the few who could escape by flight, were instantly massacred.</P>
<P>THE last great mouth of the <HI>Pegu</HI> river is the <HI>Sitang;</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">SITANG RIVER.</NOTE> it di∣vides the kingdom of <HI>Pegu</HI> from the province of <HI>Martaban.</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">MARTABAN.</NOTE> The city of that name was for some time a royal residence, and had once been the capital of an independent monarchy, but was attacked and taken by the king of <HI>Ava,</HI> who murdered the sovereign, massacred the inhabitants, and reduced the place to ashes. After this, <HI>Hamilton</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Account of the East Indies, vol. ii. p. 63.</NOTE> says, that the conqueror sunk large vessels loaden with stones at the mouth of the port, which was once a fine harbor, so that at present only small ships can enter. It had formerly been the most flourishing commercial town of the East, and still retains its potteries and manufactures, jars glazed with lead ore, large enough to contain two hogsheads. <HI>Hamilton</HI> also mentions its fisheries, and adds, that its dried mul∣lets exceed in delicacy all fish of the kind.</P>
<P>FROM the mouth of the <HI>Martaban</HI> harbor, the course runs due south, as far as the isle of <HI>Junkseilon,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">ISLE OF JUNK∣SEILON.</NOTE> an extent of above five hundred miles. The coast of <HI>Martaban</HI> takes in about a hundred and forty of the computation; the currents along the shore are most swift and violent; the country bordering on the sea little known, and very barbarous. It is skirted with small isles, and is full of danger.</P>
<P>THE natives of the kingdom of <HI>Pegu,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">NATIVES OF PEGU.</NOTE> resemble the <HI>Malays</HI> in appearance and disposition, but are more industrious. Their
<PB N="16" REF="32"/>masters, the <HI>Buraghmahs,</HI> are liker to the <HI>Arabs</HI> in their features, and of a darker complexion than the <HI>Peguers;</HI> they are much addicted to commerce, and so numerous, even in <HI>Pegu,</HI> as to ex∣ceed the natives as 100 to 1. They tattow themselves, and by rubbing in gunpowder, the marks become permanent: the men are stout made; they paint their thighs in graceful flourishes.</P>
<P>THE lower <HI>Siam,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">LOWER SIAM.</NOTE> part of the great kingdom of <HI>Siam,</HI> begins in Lat. 14° 50′.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">TOWN OF MERGUI.</NOTE> The town of <HI>Mergui</HI> stands on an island in the mouth of the river <HI>Tenasserim,</HI> in Lat. 12° 12′; it was once a most flourishing emporium, till it was, by the tyranny of the go∣vernment, almost totally deserted, and the whole neighborhood became the habitation of wild beasts. <HI>Mergui</HI> was, at the close of the last century, much frequented by the <HI>English</HI> free mer∣chants; but they were recalled by the <HI>East India</HI> company. They likewise had a fort here, now in ruins. During the inun∣dations, there is a passage from <HI>Mergui</HI> to <HI>Juthia,</HI> or the capital of <HI>Siam,</HI> which may at that season be performed the greatest part of the way on rafts in three weeks, but in the dry season the pas∣sage takes twice the time. The river runs several leagues due east, and after it has passed the city of <HI>Tenasserim,</HI> turns to the north, and keeps for a vast length of way towards its origin, which is said to be in <HI>China.</HI> The river, and the town of <HI>Mergui,</HI> were the <HI>Daona</HI> of <HI>Ptolemy,</HI> and the city of <HI>Tenasserim</HI> the <HI>Berobe.</HI></P>
<P>A GREAT chain of mountains divides the kingdom of <HI>Siam</HI> in two; it begins to the east of <HI>Tenasserim,</HI> and pointing north passes through the kingdom of <HI>Ava,</HI> continues its course through <HI>China,</HI> and probably unites with those of <HI>Thibet</HI> and even <HI>Tartary.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="33"/><HI>Mergui</HI> stands opposite to the center of the Archipelago of the same name, a most numerous group of isles,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">ARCHIPELAGO OF MERGUI.</NOTE> beginning in about Lat. 13° 13′, and reaching as low as Lat. 10° 15′, and in length stretching along the coast a hundred and thirty miles from north to south, and from thirty to fifteen miles distant from the continent: the channel has all the way good soundings, good anchorage, and regular tides, which on the springs rise to twelve feet. Captain <HI>Thomas Forrest,</HI> in 1783, took a most accurate survey of these islands, and proved the advantage of a know∣lege of the channel between them and the main land. At p. p. i. ii. of his preface, he shews how our <HI>Indiamen</HI> may, in their way to <HI>Europe,</HI> save the hazard of being embayed and losing their passage, by taking this route, and by getting round <HI>Atcheen</HI> head in <HI>Sumatra,</HI> proceed to <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>ALL the isles are mountanous, and may be seen in clear weather at the distance of fourteen or fifteen leagues, and most of them finely wooded: many of the trees are very lofty; among them is the <HI>Poon tree,</HI> or <HI>Uvaria Altissima,</HI> so useful for masts, and the <HI>Coco</HI> palm, of such universal use in all parts of <HI>India.</HI> In <HI>Pegu,</HI> the nut is esteemed a necessary of life, nearly as much as rice.</P>
<P>THE islands are of various sizes and forms, but generally very small; many exactly of the shape of a bee-hive, and clothed with woods; a few are very rocky, and so rudely broken, as to seem flung up by a mighty convulsion; such are the rocks called the <HI>Cupelo.</HI> The largest isles are <HI>St. Mathews, St. Susannas,</HI> and <HI>Sullivans,</HI> or the <HI>Domel.</HI> Among them are some very good harbors, particularly <HI>Hastings</HI> Bay, in the isle of <HI>St. Mathew.</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">HASTINGS BAY.</NOTE>
<PB N="18" REF="34"/>Mr. <HI>Forrest</HI> proposed a settlement to be formed of the natives of <HI>Hindoostan,</HI> on some of the islands, in order to profit by the rich commerce of <HI>Pegu.</HI> He says, slate and marble are found here, and that there is plenty of coral to burn into lime. He adds, <HI>Swallow,</HI> i. e. a sort of <HI>Actinia,</HI> in great request in <HI>China</HI> as a de∣licacy, and also the edible birds nests.</P>
<P>ABOUT a hundred and fifty leagues to the west of the most eastern part of the <HI>Archipelago</HI> of <HI>Mergui,</HI> are the greater and lesser islands of <HI>Andaman.</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">ISLANDS OF ANDAMAN.</NOTE> <HI>Ptolemy</HI> calls the first, <HI>Insulae Bonae Fortunae,</HI> perhaps, says M. <HI>D'Anville,</HI> because navigators might exult at escaping from shores, infamous for being inhabited by a barbarous <HI>Anthropophagi.</HI> The antient name of the lesser <HI>Anda∣man</HI> was <HI>Maniole.</HI> All the islands, even as far as the group off the west end of <HI>Sumatra,</HI> labored under the same scandal.</P>
<P>THE great <HI>Andaman</HI> is about a hundred and eight miles long, and extends from north to south between Lat. 13° 53′, and 12° 16′; it is nearly of the same breadth, or between thirty and forty miles. The mountains rise rude and lofty; that called the <HI>Saddle-back,</HI> is seen twenty-two leagues distance at sea. By Captain <HI>Wragg</HI>'s view, there appears a considerable bay on the western side, with a fine river running into the southern part: this is the island which <HI>Marco Polo</HI> calls <HI>Angania,</HI> and says, that the inhabitants live like wild beasts on fruits, and also human flesh; and that they have heads and teeth like dogs, but that their island abounds with fruits and all sorts of perfumes. The <HI>Bramins</HI> say that these isles are inhabited by devils incarnate, animated by the souls of impious men. In respect to the teeth of the inhabitants, it may be in some measure true, for in many
<PB N="19" REF="35"/>parts of the Eastern world, the natives are used to file their teeth into the form of those of the canine species.</P>
<P><HI>Frederic Caesar,</HI> a traveller of authority
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Purchas, ii. 1710.</NOTE>, sailed by these islands about the year 1564; he made the same report of their barbarity, and adds, that they refuse all commerce with strangers, and have small barks with which they attack and take any vessels they can master, and kill and eat the prisoners. <HI>Caesar</HI> met with two of their barks, having on board nuts and fruit; they refused money, and were prevaled on to exchange some of their fruits for old rags, but could not be induced by any means to come on board.</P>
<P><HI>Hamilton</HI>
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Vol. ii. 66.</NOTE> speaks of them as a fearless people; that they will swim off to any boat which approaches their island, and attack it with their wooden weapons in defiance of numbers, of our mus∣quetry, and of the missive and defensive weapons of iron and steel. They annually make an excursion in their <HI>preos</HI> or little barks to their neighbors of the <HI>Nicobar</HI> isles, and kill and take pri∣soners all they can. The <HI>Nicobarians</HI> are a quiet people, but once they took courage, and collecting their force, gave battle, and totally defeated their barbarous enemies. The same writer, from the report of a native who had been taken prisoner when young by some <HI>Nicobarians,</HI> and was converted to Mahometanism, made frequent voyages to his native islands, and often returned with four or five hundred weight of quicksilver, with which he said they abounded.</P>
<P>THE whole of the greater <HI>Andaman</HI> is skirted with small islands. Mr. <HI>Dalrymple</HI> makes mention of a cluster inhabited by
<PB N="20" REF="36"/>men most savage in their appearance, quite black, and with woolly hair like the <HI>African Caffres;</HI> their noses not so flat, for in feature they resemble the <HI>Malays;</HI> they go naked, have canoes, and use one end of their paddle as a bow to shoot with.</P>
<P>AT a great distance from the eastern side are the <HI>Barren</HI> Isle, and the isle of <HI>Narcondra,</HI> a vast mountain rising out of the sea, a land-mark from which ships take their departure.</P>
<P>ABOUT twelve leagues due south from the greater,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">LESSER ANDA∣MAN.</NOTE> is the lesser <HI>Andaman,</HI> in length twenty-six miles, a place known only by name.</P>
<P><HI>Carn Nicobar,</HI>

The middle group con∣sists of fine champaign land; and is called the <HI>Sombrera,</HI> from the resemblance of a hill on one of them to a sombrera or umbrella. <HI>Carn Nicobar,</HI> lies in Lat. 9° 10′, the southern point of the greatest <HI>Nicobar,</HI> the more southern of the series, is in Lat. 6° 51′; this and the adjacent isles are mountanous. This group was called by <HI>Ptolemy, Insulae Sindae,</HI> and the <HI>Sombrera Barussae;</HI> we are made tolerably well acquainted with these islands by means of <HI>Dampier,</HI> who on discovering the piratical designs of his captain, one <HI>Read,</HI> prevaled to be set on shore, and with two or three <HI>Achenese,</HI> who were landed after him, re∣sided
<PB N="21" REF="37"/>there some time. He represents the natives as honest, civil, and harmless, husband of one wife, and, according to the <HI>English</HI> rule, till death doth them part. They are neither ad∣dicted to quarrel, theft, or murder; in their persons they are tall and well-limbed, their visages long, noses well proportioned, and their whole features agreeable, their hair lank and black, their skins a deep copper; the men go naked, excepting the wrapper which passes round their waist, and from thence under the thighs, and brought so as to tuck before. The women wear a short petticoat not reaching lower than the knee.</P>
<P>THESE people have neither an apparent government or reli∣gion; each man is patriarchal, the ruler of his own family. Their property consists in the plantations of coco palms,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">COCO TREES.</NOTE> which are along the shores; the country inland seemed not cleared, and impervious by any paths.</P>
<P>THEY have another tree of use, which they call the <HI>Melory;</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">MELORY.</NOTE> it grows wild: <HI>Dampier,</HI> who was very observant, says he never saw any in other parts of his travels; he adds, it grows to the size of our larger apple trees; that the fruit is as big as a penny loaf, of the shape of a pear, with a smooth greenish rind; the inside is like that of an apple, but full of small strings: it is their chief food; they either eat it boiled, or scrape the pulp clear from the strings, and make it into a cake as large as a <HI>Dutch</HI> cheese, which will keep six or seven days, and has a good taste; they have a few small hogs, and some poultry.</P>
<P>THE principal employ of the natives is fishing: their ca∣noes are sharp at each end; flat on one side, and convex on
<PB N="22" REF="38"/>the other, and have some slight outriggers. These vessels go either with a sail or paddle, and hold from nine to thirty men.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Nicobar</HI> islands produce the beautiful and singular pigeon,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">PIGEON.</NOTE> to which they give name; the feathers on the head are purple, those of the neck, long, narrow, and sharp-pointed like the hac∣cle of a cock, and reflecting various glosses of purple, red, gold, blue, and copper; the back a changeable green; the primaries a fine blue; the tail and its coverts white.</P>
<P>I NOW cross from the greater or more southern <HI>Nicobar</HI> to the island of <HI>Junkseilon,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">ISLAND OF JUNKSEILON.</NOTE> about two hundred and sixty miles distant. It lies north-east of the former, between Lat. 7° 30′ and 8° 24′, is of a long form, the coast extremely indented with bays, and very salient promontories; the chief port is <HI>Popra,</HI> the <HI>Tacola emporium</HI> of <HI>Ptolemy. Hamilton</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. ii. 68.</NOTE> says it produces good masts, and that it has plenty of tin; about five hundred tons are an∣nually exported, according to the account given by Captain <HI>For∣rest,</HI> who was there in 1784. The island, subject to <HI>Siam,</HI> is governed by a viceroy and three assistants, and contains about twelve thousand inhabitants. The northern end is divided from the continent by a channel not exceeding a mile in breadth. Between the eastern side and the main land, is a great bay filled with numbers of small isles, and in the middle <HI>Pulo Panjang,</HI> which from north to south is in length twenty-three miles
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Forrest, p. 30.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE kingdom of lower <HI>Siam,</HI> bounds the northern and eastern sides of the bay; within the last is comprehended the narrow isthmus of the peninsula of <HI>Malacca,</HI> which does not exceed in breadth fifty miles.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="39"/>AT the termination of the kingdom of <HI>Siam,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">KINGDOM OF QUEDAH.</NOTE> begins the little monarchy of <HI>Quedah,</HI> a flat and fertile country, which extends several leagues along the coast. It was once tributary to <HI>Siam,</HI> but during a war the <HI>Siamese</HI> were engaged in with <HI>Pegu,</HI> it re∣volted, and is governed by a <HI>Malay Mahometan</HI> prince, as ty∣rannical as he is poor; he resides in a town about fifty miles from the sea, on a small navigable river; the mouth of which is in Lat. 6° 10′. This river, according to <HI>Mannevillette,</HI> branches, pe∣ninsulates a great tract, and reverts to the sea, forming two distant entrances into the country; the interior land rises to a great heighth. The monarch never fails visiting the <HI>European</HI> ships which enter the port, to extort from them some present; the religion of the country is a mongrel <HI>Mahometanism,</HI> mixed with the native idolatry.</P>
<P>THE little <HI>Quedah</HI> turtle
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sonnerat, vol. ii. 177.</NOTE> is of the size of a sparrow,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">TURTLE DOVE.</NOTE> and most delicious food; it has been transported to the Isle of <HI>France,</HI> where it has multiplied greatly.</P>
<P>THE northern end of the island of <HI>Sumatra</HI> lies in Lat. 5° 5′, and immediately opposite to old <HI>Quedah.</HI> That part of <HI>Sumatra</HI> trends fast to the south-east till it reaches Cape <HI>Diamond,</HI> in Lat. 4° 50′, which is the parallel of <HI>Pulo Dolom,</HI> an isle close to the shore of the peninsula of <HI>Malacca.</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">STREIGHTS OF MALACCA.</NOTE> Here commences the <HI>Peri∣mulicus sinus,</HI> or great streights of <HI>Malacca,</HI> bounded by <HI>Sumatra</HI> on the west, and the peninsula on the east. I shall scarcely men∣tion that noble island, till I begin with it as chief of those of the <HI>Indian Ocean.</HI></P>
<P>THE next place of note on the coast, is a great tract of flat
<PB N="24" REF="40"/>land, insulated by several channels, which form various isles, and open by different mouths into the sea.</P>
<P>THE greater isle,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">PULO PERA.</NOTE> or <HI>Pulo Pera,</HI> the antient <HI>Perumela empo∣rium,</HI> has a most useful and magnificent harbor which runs far inland, with various branches on the right and on the left; it has from eight to five fathoms of water; a mountain rises out of the middle of the isle; the river that runs up the country is called by Mr. <HI>Forrest, Pera.</HI> Before its mouth is <HI>Pulo Ding-Ding,</HI> and other isles. That navigator
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 28.</NOTE> went up the river to visit the monarch of the country, who was attended by guards, dressed in <HI>Chinese</HI> habits, with the dragon on their breasts.</P>
<P>FARTHER to the south, in Lat. 2° 50′, the streights contract in breadth very considerably.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">PULO ARU.</NOTE> The small isles <HI>Pulo Aru</HI> are in the middle of the channel, which here begins to be greatly nar∣rowed by rocks and banks on each shore. On the <HI>Malacca</HI> side, to the south-east of <HI>Pulo Aru,</HI> is a large bay, filled with flat morassy isles, divided by very narrow channels. On one of the most southern of them stands <HI>Mount Parcelar,</HI> a noted sea∣mark to ships navigating this dangerous streight.</P>
<P>STILL more to the south,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">MALACCA CITY.</NOTE> in Lat. 2° 20′, is <HI>Malacca,</HI> the ca∣pital city of the peninsula; it probably succeeded <HI>Perimula</HI> as the emporium of this part of <HI>India.</HI> When the great <HI>Albu∣querque</HI> had made his country sovereign of <HI>Ceylon,</HI> he turned his thoughts towards this territory, and determined to give to <HI>Por∣tugal</HI> the whole commerce of the East. At that time <HI>Malacca</HI> possessed the entire trade of <HI>India;</HI> ships from every port of <HI>Hindoostan,</HI> from <HI>China,</HI> the <HI>Phillipine</HI> and the <HI>Molucca</HI> islands,
<PB N="25" REF="41"/>from <HI>Persia, Arabia,</HI> and even <HI>Africa,</HI> filled its harbor. The <HI>Arabians</HI> brought with them their religion, and established <HI>Ma∣hometanism</HI> in the court of this kingdom, as they had done in that of <HI>Hindoostan.</HI></P>
<P>THIS port was first visited in 1508 by the <HI>Portuguese</HI> ad∣miral <HI>Lopez Sequiera.</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">TAKEN BY THE PORTUGUESE.</NOTE> On his arrival he met with the most friendly reception from the reigning monarch; but such a jea∣lousy arose among the commercial people of the different na∣tions, especially the <HI>Arabs,</HI> which they so effectually instilled into the prince, as soon to destroy the good understanding be∣tween him and the strangers he had so suddenly taken an affec∣tion for. His conduct had lulled the <HI>Portuguese</HI> into so deep a security, that numbers of them took up their residence in the city, and <HI>Sequiera</HI> even appointed <HI>Araujo,</HI> a favorite of <HI>Albu∣querque</HI>'s, as consul. The prince did not dare to attack the ad∣miral by open force, but used every species of treachery to de∣stroy him. Finding his plots detected, he ordered his subjects to massacre the <HI>Europeans</HI> who were in their power. Numbers were slain; but <HI>Araujo</HI> and a few others were kept as hostages to prevent the revenge of the admiral, who, after various endea∣vors to recover them, was obliged to leave them behind, and to set sail for the <HI>Malabar</HI> coast.</P>
<P><HI>Albuquerque</HI> took advantage of the quarrel; he sailed from <HI>Goa</HI> in 1511, and soon appearing before the port of <HI>Malacca,</HI> clamed the release of his countrymen. These demands were at first refused; but after some hostilities, the king was so terri∣fied as to send to <HI>Albuquerque, Araujo</HI> and all the surviving <HI>Por∣tuguese.</HI> Notwithstanding this, it was discovered that he intended
<PB N="26" REF="42"/>nothing less than the destruction of the <HI>Europeans.</HI> It is evident he had great reason to suspect his new guests, for <HI>Albuquerque,</HI> among other requests, desired leave to erect a fort to secure his countrymen from any future attacks. This the king knew was only a prelude to the subjection of him and his subjects to a fo∣reign yoke. The refusal was followed by the landing of the <HI>Por∣tuguese;</HI> several severe skirmishes ensued, which, as usual, ended with the defeat of the <HI>Indians.</HI> The city was forced, and the pa∣lace taken by storm, but though the king found means to escape with all his valuable effects, <HI>Albuquerque</HI> got two hundred thou∣sand ducats to his share of the plunder. Among other means of resistance, the <HI>Malayes</HI> placed in the way of the assailants a sort of <HI>chevaux de frize</HI> with poisoned points. No people are so expert as the <HI>Malayes</HI> in that dreadful art. The city was also defended by three thousand cannon, a number of artillery surprising in those days. The monarch fled to the woods, where he soon died of grief. This success of <HI>Albuquerque</HI>'s struck all the neighboring nations with admiration. The king of <HI>Siam,</HI> and the princes of <HI>Sumatra</HI> and <HI>Java,</HI> and the other neighboring isles, sent to him embassadors, and various rich presents. Those from <HI>Java</HI> very politically presented him with spears and darts, all kinds of hostile weapons, and pieces of embroidery representing the warlike ex∣ploits of their master, to impress on the stranger an idea of the valor of the <HI>Javanese</HI> monarch.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Portuguese</HI> from time to time fortified <HI>Malacca</HI> in a manner suitable to its importance, and it became the greatest em∣porium in <HI>India.</HI> By this wise stroke of policy, <HI>Albuquerque</HI> gave to his country the possession of the gold, the gems, the spices,
<PB N="27" REF="43"/>and other rich productions of <HI>India ultra Gangem,</HI> and its islands, as he did before those of <HI>Hindoostan,</HI> by the capture of the famous city of <HI>Goa.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Portuguese</HI> continued in possession of <HI>Malacca</HI> till the year 1641,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">EXPELLED BY THE DUTCH.</NOTE> when it was wrested out of their hands by the <HI>Dutch,</HI> after a six months siege. The governor is accused by historians of treachery, and to have been bribed into a surrender; but it is certain that he did not give the place up till after the most gallant defence. The <HI>Dutch,</HI> sensible of its value, paid the utmost attention to its fortifications, and to every thing that could revive the antient commerce, which had almost sunk to nothing, by the tyranny and usual ill conduct of the <HI>Portu∣guese.</HI></P>
<P>THE city had in their time several fine churches, and num∣bers of monasteries; and the Jesuits a noble college, in which they exercised great hospitality. All these of course fell to decay under the reign of the sons of <HI>Calvin.</HI> Sharp as they are, they were outwitted by the sons of <HI>Rome:</HI> the religious of the several convents made a request to the conqueror, that they might be permitted to quit their houses in solemn procession; each carried a large waxen taper in his hand, within which were concealed their diamonds, and all the lesser treasures. The vic∣tors were defrauded of the fruits of their valor, and, as <HI>Son∣nerat</HI> says, their commander lost his head, on his return to <HI>Holland,</HI> for not having sagacity enough to discover the trick.</P>
<P><HI>Malacca</HI> is exceedingly large; much of it is built of strong bamboo, but the several stone buildings, among them the gover∣nor's house, make a conspicuous figure. A narrow but deep and
<PB N="28" REF="44"/>rapid river divides the town from the fort, one side of which is washed by the sea; in that part only four leagues distant from the low land of <HI>Sumatra. Malacca</HI> is a true emporium, or mart, the great magazine of the various rich articles of commerce brought from the several countries I have mentioned. As to the peninsula itself, it yields little more than the sine tin and elephants' teeth. Let me conclude, that this place was celebrated among the an∣tients for its gold,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">AUREA CHER∣SONESUS.</NOTE> for which reason it was called by them <HI>Aurea Chersonesus;</HI> still, at no great distance from the city of <HI>Ma∣lacca,</HI> is a hill called the <HI>Golden Mount.</HI> Some imagine this to have been the <HI>Ophir</HI> of <HI>Solomon.</HI> I shall mention, in vol. of the Outlines of the Globe, the supposition that <HI>Ophir</HI> was a place in <HI>Aethiopia.</HI> I will not enter into the dispute, and only say, that if the birds which we know at present by the name of pea∣cocks, were those intended
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Kings, ch. x. verse 22.</NOTE>, this, or some other part of <HI>India,</HI> might have been the place from which <HI>Solomon</HI> drew his wealth, peacocks being found in plenty here, and unknown, at least in those days, in any part of <HI>Africa.</HI></P>
<P>To the south of <HI>Malacca</HI> is the small kingdom of <HI>Johore;</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">KINGDOM OF JOHORE.</NOTE> we have scarce any acquaintance with it, and know little more of its history, than that it was governed by a brutal set of princes, and that in 1712 a rebellion arose, which ended in the expulsion of the royal family.</P>
<P>THE southern entrance into the streights of <HI>Malacca</HI> is filled with a most numerous archipelago of small isles, even to the shores of <HI>Sumatra.</HI> The land from <HI>Tanjong Buro,</HI> in <HI>Johore,</HI> bends into a crescent, likewise filled with isles. One is called <HI>Sin∣capour,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">STREIGHTS OF SINCAPOUR.</NOTE> which gives name to the well-known passage for ships
<PB N="29" REF="45"/>bound to or from the East. There are several other channels be∣tween the islands, but that of <HI>Sincapour</HI> is the best; yet all are subject to danger, by reason of the rapidity and irregularity of the tides, and the reefs or sand banks which are found in some or other of these narrow passages. The western horn of the cre∣scent is <HI>Cape Romano;</HI> this stands in Lat. 2° 12′,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">CAPE ROMANO.</NOTE> and is the most southern point of the continent of <HI>Asia.</HI> A little to the west of that point, on a large river, stands the city of <HI>Johore,</HI> or <HI>Batusa∣bar,</HI> erroneously supposed by M. <HI>D'Anville</HI> to have been the same with the <HI>Zaba</HI> or <HI>Sabana emporium</HI> of <HI>Ptolemy.</HI> The <HI>Cape Ro∣mano</HI> is certainly the <HI>Magnum Promontorium,</HI> or <HI>Malaeucolon,</HI> a name borrowed from the antient <HI>Malayes. Romano</HI> seems to be a traditional name, used in memory of the nations which fre∣quented the adjacent port, where the ships must often have been obliged to wait for the proper wind, to enable them to double the great promontory, and pursue their voyage to the several marts on each side of the gulph of <HI>Siam.</HI></P>
<P>FOR the tracing the remainder of the coasts on the continent, I shall no more consult the opinion of my able guide, M. <HI>D'An∣ville,</HI> but follow that of a countryman, Mr. <HI>John Caverhill,</HI> who, in the lviith volume of the Philosophical Transactions, has given a very able criticism on those parts of <HI>Ptolemy</HI> which relate to these particular shores.</P>
<P>AFTER doubling the <HI>Cape Romano,</HI> the peninsula takes a north north-western direction. Between Lat. 2° 22′, and <HI>Pulo Va∣rela,</HI> in Lat. 3° 20′ is an extensive group of small isles, which fill the sea for a considerable breadth, almost to the very shore; the largest is <HI>Pulo Timon.</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">PULO TIMON.</NOTE> In passing down the streights of <HI>Ma∣lacca,</HI> 
<PB N="30" REF="46"/>as far as <HI>Cape Romano,</HI> navigators are obliged to take an eastern course
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dampier's Voyage, ii. 5.</NOTE>. This proves how well <HI>Ptolemy</HI> was informed when he said, that the <HI>Roman</HI> ships bound for <HI>Cattigara</HI> took that direction, but afterwards, when they had doubled the Cape, they (being hurried easterly by the tide, which rushes through the streights of <HI>Sincapour</HI>) were under the necessity of making a tack, and proceeding westerly, to reach the several ports they might be bound for, in the <HI>Magnus Sinus.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Pahang</HI> port,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">PAHANG</NOTE> and town, are in Lat. 3° 50′, and in a most fruitful country. The mouth of the river has an island before it. The north channel has, at high water, the depth of four fathoms, and just within the bar, good anchorage in six. The estuary is a mile broad, but so full of sand banks, that it is with great trouble a vessel of thirty tons can work up to the town, distant twelve miles from the sea. The river rises far up the country, washes the foot of the hill of <HI>Malacca,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">GOLD.</NOTE> and contains a vast deal of gold. <HI>Hamilton</HI> visited this country in 1719, and reports, that lumps of five or six ounces weight have been found. The divers usually descend to the depth of three fathoms, but the greatest lumps of the pretious metal are found in ten. Some years eight hundred weight have been exported. Well may this country have been supposed to have been another <HI>Ophir. Josephus</HI>
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lib. viii. c. ii.</NOTE> seems to have been right in fixing it here, if his authority was good for saying, that the antient name of this part of <HI>India</HI> was <HI>Sophora,</HI> now the land of gold, which comes so very near to that of <HI>Ophir.</HI> Possibly the word is the <HI>Malayan</HI> name for the pre∣tious metal. M. <HI>Le Poivre</HI> says, that the inhabitants of <HI>Malacca</HI>
<PB N="31" REF="47"/>and <HI>Sumatra</HI> call their gold mines <HI>ophirs,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Marsden</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Voyage to Sumatra, p. 8.</NOTE>, that in the latter island is a hill named <HI>Mount Ophir,</HI> possibly from its having been once rich in gold.</P>
<P>MUCH pepper is cultivated on the sides of the river;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">PEPPER.</NOTE> about three hundred tons have been sent to market, but had there been a demand, three thousand might be raised in the space of five years. The best canes in the world are said to grow in these parts.</P>
<P><HI>Trangano</HI> or <HI>Tringoran,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">TRANGANO.</NOTE> a small town a little to the north of <HI>Pahang,</HI> is seated on a river near the sea, in which small ships may moor securely among the rocks. The town did consist of above a thousand houses, half of which are inhabited by <HI>Chinese,</HI> who traffic in their <HI>jonks</HI> to <HI>Siam, Cambodia,</HI> and <HI>Tonquin. Tran∣gano</HI> is most deliciously seated amidst low hills, covered with the eternal verdure of undeciduous trees; lemons, oranges,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">FRUITS.</NOTE> mango∣stans, and all the fruits of the <HI>Indies</HI> grow here in perfection; and the vallies laugh with grain, pulse, and sugar, but all owing to the industry of the <HI>Chinese.</HI> The feudal <HI>Malayes</HI> are too lazy to make the earth yield its increase. Pepper is raised in great abundance, but the port is shut up from <HI>October to March,</HI> by a most violent sea, driven in by the north-east monsoons. In the still months, the sea is said to afford the finest of fish. <HI>Pto∣lemy</HI> places, either in the neighborhood of this town or <HI>Pahang,</HI> a place called <HI>Thagora.</HI></P>
<P>LATITUDE 6° passes over part of the group of the <HI>Ridang</HI> isles,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">RIDANO ISLES.</NOTE> which lie not remote from the coast. They are inhabited by <HI>Malayan</HI> pirates, who seize on any vessels they can master, es∣pecially
<PB N="32" REF="48"/>the <HI>Chinese,</HI> and sell the crews and passengers for slaves. It is not infrequent that they murder the whole crew. Their vessels are crowded with men, armed either with lances and cresses, or short daggers. They suddenly board the ships they think they can master; and having their native ferocity heightened by opium, instantly stab all whom they find in their way. These miscreants swarm in the streights of <HI>Malacca,</HI> and in all the islands which go under the name of <HI>Malaye.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Patani,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">PATANI.</NOTE>, in Lat. 6° 50′, the next town of note, lies close on the shore, and was once greatly frequented by ships from <HI>Surat,</HI> the <HI>Malabar</HI> coast, and that of <HI>Coromandel,</HI> beside what come from <HI>China</HI> and other neighboring countries; but the merchants finding no protection from the murderous pirates, quite deserted the place. This may have been the <HI>Balonga</HI> of <HI>Ptolemy.</HI></P>
<P>ADVANCING still north,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">GULPH OF SIAM.</NOTE> we enter the gulph of <HI>Siam,</HI> the <HI>Magnus Sinus</HI> of the same geographer; the land after passing <HI>Patani,</HI> makes a considerable curvature towards the west, which continues as far as <HI>Patanor,</HI> in about Lat. 10°, where it bends towards the north-east, till it ends in the bottom of the gulph at the river of <HI>Siam.</HI> Thus finishes the outline of this celebrated peninsula.</P>
<P>IN this curvature,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">PIPERI.</NOTE> near the bottom of the bay, stood the an∣tient <HI>Sipiberis,</HI> the modern <HI>Piperi;</HI> and to the south of it <HI>Sindu,</HI> the present <HI>Sini.</HI></P>
<P>WE shall take a review of its whole extent, from the northern end of its isthmus, in Lat. 9° 12′, to its southern extremity at cape <HI>Romano,</HI> which is about six hundred and sixty miles. The breadth in the widest part, is about two hundred miles; from
<PB N="33" REF="49"/>that part it gradually narrows till it ends nearly in a point at cape <HI>Romano.</HI> All the interior parts of the country are hilly; the lower grounds towards the sea marshy and wooded.</P>
<P>IN respect to the general view of the peninsula, its produc∣tions, and the singular manners and government of the inhabi∣tants, it is impossible to give a more clear statement than in the words of M. <HI>Le Poivre,</HI> the author of the celebrated <HI>Voyages d'un Philosophe.</HI> We use the translation of 1769, which is done in a style equally elegant with that of the original; I will not in∣jure it by abridgment, but give the whole, from p. 67 to p. 78, and afterwards some explanatory remarks on certain parts, and a brief account of the natural history, collected from different ma∣terials. In the articles of botany, mineralogy, and zoology, there is so great agreement between the productions of the op∣posite <HI>Sumatra</HI> and the peninsula, that I shall, except in a very few instances, defer entering on those subjects till I arrive in that great island.</P>
<P>I SHALL now return to M. <HI>Le Poivre.</HI></P>
<P>"BEYOND the kingdom of <HI>Siam,</HI>"
<NOTE PLACE="marg">OF THE MALAYES.</NOTE> says that most observant and judicious traveller,
<Q>is the peninsula of <HI>Malacca,</HI> a country for∣merly well peopled, and consequently well cultivated. This nation was once one of the greatest powers, and made a very considerable figure on the theatre of <HI>Asia.</HI> The sea was covered with their ships, and they carried on a most extensive commerce. Their laws, however, were apparently very dif∣ferent from those which subsist among them at present. From time to time they sent out numbers of colonies, which, one after another, peopled the islands of <HI>Sumatra, Java, Bor∣neo,</HI>
<PB N="34" REF="50"/>the <HI>Celebes,</HI> or <HI>Macassar,</HI> the <HI>Moluccas,</HI> the <HI>Phillippines,</HI> and those innumerable islands of the <HI>Archipelago,</HI> which bound <HI>Asia</HI> on the east, and which occupy an extent of seven hundred leagues in longitude from east to west, by about six hundred of latitude from north to south. The inhabitants of all these islands, those at least upon the coasts, are the same people, they speak almost the same language, have the same laws, the same manners.—Is it not somewhat singular, that this nation, whose possessions are so extensive, should scarce be known in Europe? I shall endeavor to give you an idea of those laws, and those manners; you will, from thence, easily judge of their agriculture.</Q></P>
<P><Q>TRAVELLERS who make observations on the <HI>Malais,</HI> are astonished to find, in the center of <HI>Asia,</HI> under the scorching climate of the line, the laws, the manners, the customs, and the prejudices of the antient inhabitants of the north of <HI>Eu∣rope.</HI> The <HI>Malais</HI> are governed by feudal laws, that capri∣cious system, conceived for the defence of the liberty of a few against the tyranny of one, whilst the multitude is subjected to slavery and oppression.</Q></P>
<P><Q>A CHIEF, who has the title of king or sultan, issues his commands to his great vassals, who obey when they think proper; these have inferior vassals, who often act in the same manner with regard to them. A small part of the nation live independent, under the title of <HI>Oramcai</HI> or noble, and sell their services to those who pay them best; whilst the body of the nation is composed of slaves, and live in perpetual servitude.</Q></P>
<P><Q>WITH these laws the <HI>Malais</HI> are restless, fond of navigation,
<PB N="35" REF="51"/>war, plunder, emigrations, colonies, desperate enterprises, ad∣ventures, and gallantry. They talk incessantly of their ho∣nor, and their bravery, whilst they are universally considered, by those with whom they have intercourse, as the most treacherous, ferocious people on the face of the globe; and yet, which appeared to me extremely singular, they speak the softest language of <HI>Asia.</HI> That which the Count <HI>de Forbin</HI> has said in his memoirs, of the ferocity of the <HI>Macassars,</HI> is exactly true, and is the reigning characteristic of the whole <HI>Malay</HI> nations; more attached to the absurd laws of their pre∣tended honor, than to those of justice or humanity, you al∣ways observe, that amongst them, the strong oppress and de∣stroy the weak; their treaties of peace and friendship never subsisting beyond that self-interest which induced them to make them, they are almost always armed, and either at war amongst themselves, or employed in pillaging their neigh∣bors.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THIS ferocity, which the <HI>Malais</HI> qualify under the name of courage, is so well known to the <HI>European</HI> companies, who have settlements in the <HI>Indies,</HI> that they have universally agreed in prohibiting the captains of their ships, who may put into the <HI>Malay</HI> islands, from taking on board any seamen of that nation, except in the greatest distress, and then, on no account to exceed two or three.</Q></P>
<P><Q>IT is nothing uncommon for a handful of these horrid savages suddenly to embark, attack a vessel by surprise, poignard in hand, massacre the people, and make themselves masters of her. <HI>Malay</HI> batteaus, with twenty-five or thirty
<PB N="36" REF="52"/>men, have been known to board <HI>European</HI> ships of thirty or forty guns, in order to take possession of them, and murder, with their poignards, great part of the crew. The <HI>Malay</HI> history is full of such enterprises, which mark the desperate ferocity of these barbarians.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THE <HI>Malais</HI> who are not slaves go always armed, they would think themselves disgraced if they went abroad without their poignards, which they call <HI>Crit;</HI> the industry of this nation even surpasses itself, in the fabric of this destructive weapon.</Q></P>
<P><Q>As their lives are a perpetual round of agitation and tu∣mult, they could never endure the long flowing habits which prevail amongst the other <HI>Asiatics.</HI> The habits of the <HI>Malais</HI> are exactly adapted to their shapes, and loaded with a multi∣tude of buttons, which fasten them close to their bodies in every part. I relate these seemingly trifling observations, in order to prove, that in climates the most opposite, the same laws produce similar manners, customs, and prejudices; their effect is the same too with respect to agriculture.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THE lands possessed by the <HI>Malais</HI> are, in general, of a su∣perior quality; nature seems to have taken pleasure in there assembling her most favorite productions. They have not only those to be found in the territories of <HI>Siam,</HI> but a variety of others peculiar to these islands. The country is covered with odoriferous woods, such as the eagle or aloes wood, the sandal, and the <HI>Cassia Odorata,</HI> a species of cinnamon: you there breathe an air impregnated with the odors of innumerable flowers of the greatest fragrance, of which there is a perpe∣tual
<PB N="37" REF="53"/>succession the year round, the sweet flavor of which cap∣tivates the soul, and inspires the most voluptuous sensations. No traveller, wandering over the plains of <HI>Malacca,</HI> but feels himself strongly impelled to wish his residence fixed in a place so luxuriant in allurements, where nature triumphs without the assistance of art.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THE <HI>Malay</HI> islands produce various kinds of dying woods, particularly the <HI>Sapan,</HI> which is the same with the <HI>Brazil</HI> wood. There are also a number of gold mines, which the in∣habitants of <HI>Sumatra</HI> and <HI>Malacca</HI> call <HI>Ophirs;</HI> some of which, those especially on the eastern coast, are richer than those of <HI>Brazil</HI> or <HI>Peru.</HI> There are likewise mines of fine copper, mixed with gold, which the inhabitants name <HI>Tom∣bage.</HI> In the islands of <HI>Sumatra</HI> and <HI>Banca,</HI> are mines of <HI>calin,</HI> or sine tin; and at <HI>Succadana,</HI> in the island of <HI>Borneo,</HI> is a mine of diamonds. Those islands enjoy also exclusively, the <HI>rotin,</HI> the <HI>sagow,</HI> (or bread palm tree) the camphre, and other precious aromatics, which we know under the names of va∣rious spiceries.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THE sea too teems with abundance of excellent fish, to∣gether with ambergris, pearls, and those delicate birds nests (so much in request in <HI>China)</HI> formed in the rocks with the spawn of fishes and the foam of the sea, by a species of small sized swallow peculiar to those seas; this is of such an exquisite substance and flavor, that the <HI>Chinese</HI> long purchased them for their weight in gold, and still buy them at an excessive price.</Q></P>
<P><Q>IN the midst of all this luxuriance of nature, the <HI>Malay</HI> is
<PB N="38" REF="54"/>miserable; the culture of the lands, abandoned to slaves, is fallen into contempt. These wretched laborers, dragged in∣cessantly from their rustic employments, by then restless masters, who delight in war and maritime enterprises, have rarely time, and never resolution, to give the necessary atten∣tion to the laboring of their grounds; their lands, in general, remain uncultivated, and produce no kind of grain for the subsistence of the inhabitants.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Malacca</HI> abounds with quadrupeds, especially with tigers, and others of the most savage kind. It is customary here and in <HI>Pegu,</HI> for the tyrants of the country to make banishment into the woods, for a certain time, a punishment; the unhappy objects are sure of never returning; they quickly become a prey to the tiger, or if they chance to escape the fangs of that cruel animal, fall victims to hunger or corroding fear.</P>
<P>THE only peculiar quadruped seems to be the <HI>Civet</HI> described by M. <HI>Sonnerat</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. ii. 144. tab. xci.</NOTE>,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">CIVET ANIMAL.</NOTE> an elegant species, of the size of a common cat; the ground color is a perlaceous grey, darkest on the up∣per part of the body; above the eyes is a line of four small spots; on the hind part of the head commence three black bands ending on the shoulders; another divides the belly lengthways; on the reins are three, which end at the tail; on the sides and thighs are seven rows of round black spots, sixty-one in number; the tail is long, and annulated with black and grey. This animal inhabits the woods, leaps from tree to tree, and is extremely fierce. It distils from the opening placed near the genitals, a musky liquor, which the <HI>Malayes</HI> collect, and pretend
<PB N="39" REF="55"/>that it fortifies the stomach, and excites the amorous passions; for which last purpose it is bought and highly esteemed by the <HI>Chinese.</HI></P>
<P>M. <HI>Sonnerat</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. ii. 102.</NOTE> gives a very apocryphal account of the wild men of <HI>Malacca,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">WILD MEN.</NOTE> who inhabit the woods and live in the trees. If they see any one pass, they instantly descend and devour him. There is, says he, another kind, less ferocious, and which shun the society of their anthropophagous brethren; these live on fruits, are monogamous, and never cohabit with their wives, but when nature invites; some even will enter into a sort of traffic with the <HI>Malayes,</HI> and deposit at the foot of their tree-habita∣tions, the tin they collect on the mountains, for which the natives leave fruits, and any trifles they think acceptable to their secluded brethren; their language is unknown. M. <HI>Son∣nerat</HI> says he saw one (taken young) in the service of a counsellor of <HI>Malacca.</HI> I wish he had fallen to the lot of a <HI>Scotch Judge;</HI> what a treasure would he have been to Lord <HI>Monboddo!</HI> Seriously, M. <HI>Sonnerat</HI> must have collected some tales of the <HI>Ourang Outang,</HI> possibly a native of this country, as it is of the <HI>Malayan</HI> archipelago.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Malayes</HI> are a well made people, but rather below (says Mr. <HI>Marsden</HI>) the middle stature; their limbs small, well shaped, and particularly slender at the wrists and ancles; their complexions tawney; their eyes large; their noses flat, probably by art; their hair black, shining, and very long.</P>
<P>THERE are a few birds that I mention,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">BIRDS.</NOTE> because M. <HI>Sonnerat</HI> ascribes them to the peninsula; yet all that are found here must
<PB N="40" REF="56"/>also inhabit <HI>Sumatra.</HI> He gives us the description of the blue-rumped perroquet of Mr. <HI>Latham,</HI> Supp. lxvi. The fore head and rump are blue; the predominant color of the rest of the plumage pale-green; the inner coverts of the wings crimson.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">MANGOSTAN.</NOTE> I must here mention the <HI>Garcinia Mango∣stana,</HI> the most boasted fruit of the <HI>Indies,</HI> and which is found in the highest perfection in this peninsula; the name <HI>Mangostan</HI> is <HI>Malayan.</HI> It is a species confined to <HI>Malacca</HI> and the <HI>Malaye</HI> isles; grows neither in <HI>Hindoostan,</HI> nor naturally in the <HI>Mo∣lucca</HI> isles, but is cultivated in <HI>Amboina;</HI> the tree does not attain any great height; the fruit is of the size of a small apple, of a round form, and deep red wine color; on the summit is a star of five or six rays, squared at their ends; at the bottom are four hollow leaves, the remains of the calyx; the inside is purple, and like a furrowed globe divided into segments, each containing a kernel. These segments are full of juice, the most delicious that can be imagined, a fine mixture of tart and sweet, and so whole∣some as to be allowed in any quantities to feverous patients.

<P>I NOW return to the coast.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">UPPER SIAM.</NOTE> The kingdom of <HI>Siam</HI> recom∣mences on this side near <HI>Sangora,</HI> exactly opposite to its limits on the bay of <HI>Bengal.</HI> The town stands on a large river, and has some commerce in tin, ivory, aloe-wood, and coarse gold. <HI>Ligore,</HI> about twelve leagues to the north,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">LIGORE.</NOTE> is a very commer∣cial town, and its neighborhood produces abundance of tin and of elephants teeth. It is seated a few miles up the river, and built of bamboo, thatched with reeds; the pagodas have lofty steeples in form of pyramids. The <HI>Dutch</HI> have or had here a factory; their houses stand a league within the mouth of the river, and are built with brick. The road for shipping is two leagues at sea.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="58"/>THE whole eastern side of <HI>Siam</HI> is low, steep, and rocky, but inland rises into lofty mountains. Towards the bottom of the gulph the land approximates, and the contracted part is called the bay of <HI>Siam;</HI> its entrance is by the mounts of <HI>Pensels</HI> or <HI>Pentens,</HI> impending over the water on the western shore, and the high cape <HI>Siam</HI> on the opposite. The last may be seen from the bar of <HI>Siam,</HI> or the <HI>Meinam</HI> river, twenty-two leagues distant.</P>
<P>ABOUT four hundred and eight miles from <HI>Ligore</HI> (following the curvature of the gulph) at the very bottom of the bay of <HI>Siam,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">RIVER MEINAM.</NOTE> is the mouth of the great river <HI>Meinam,</HI> the <HI>Serus</HI> of <HI>Ptolemy,</HI> and the most consequential in the kingdom. The road for shipping extends for the space of three leagues, in which all sorts of vessels may safely ride; such was the case when that learned traveller <HI>Koempfer</HI> visited the place in 1690. The coun∣try on both sides the river is marshy, composed of the mud brought down in the annual floods; this river, like the <HI>Ganges,</HI> being subject to periodical inundations. <HI>Koempfer</HI> informs us that the name <HI>Manam</HI> or <HI>Meinam,</HI> in the <HI>Siamese</HI> language, sig∣nifies the mother of humidities, from its abundance of water, which so greatly fertilizes the country. It is deep, rapid, and broader than the <HI>Elbe;</HI> the upper part is rocky, violent, and in∣terrupted by cataracts; the lower, divided into several channels, passes through a very level country to the sea. The banks of the river are covered with trees, animated by monkies; numbers of villages may be seen on both sides; the houses generally stand, I may say, upon stilts or lofty posts, so that the water during the inundations may pass without incommoding the occupiers. Near the city of <HI>Judia,</HI> many of the villages consist of inhabited ships,
<PB N="43" REF="59"/>or floating habitations; these occasionally move from place to place when the waters are high; the inmates keep a sort of fair, and dispose of their various commodities.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Meinam</HI> rises at a considerable distance to the north, in the very extremity of the kingdom, possibly far beyond, for its fountains seem never to have been traced, and the best ac∣counts are very uncertain; its course, as far as we know, runs due north and south.</P>
<P><HI>Juthia</HI> or <HI>Judia,</HI> the capital of <HI>Siam,</HI> is seated in about Lat.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">CITY OF JUTHIA.</NOTE> 14° 30′, on a low island in the form of a man's foot. It is sur∣rounded with a lofty brick wall. The streets are strait, and accom∣modated with canals, which pass quite through from east to west. As Mr. <HI>Caverhill</HI> very reasonably fixes the <HI>Zaba</HI> of <HI>Ptolemy</HI> to have been in the bottom of the bay of <HI>Siam,</HI> I see no reason against supposing that it might have been either at <HI>Juthia,</HI> or at some place not remote from that port. Ships may enter into many of the canals, and discharge their cargo near the principal houses. The greater part of the streets are very mean, built with bamboo, covered with the leaves of palms. Those of the <HI>Chinese, Hindoos,</HI> and <HI>Moors,</HI> are of stone, but very low; the finest houses in <HI>Koempfer</HI>'s time, were such which had been inhabited by the <HI>English, Dutch,</HI> and <HI>French.</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">HISTORY OF PHAULKON.</NOTE> The palace of the unfortu∣nate <HI>Phaulkon,</HI> minister of state in the last century, makes the most conspicuous figure; <HI>Phaulkon</HI> was a <HI>Grecian</HI> by birth, and seaman by profession; he had served various nations, but chiefly the <HI>English.</HI> In their service, in capacity of a cockswain, he came to <HI>Siam,</HI> and obtained an employment at court. He was a man of very fine natural abilities; and by his good con∣duct
<PB N="44" REF="60"/>and his success in the management of affairs, rose to the highest dignities, and became prime minister to the reigning prince.</P>
<P>HIS ambition proved his ruin, and brought him to a violent death by the hands of the executioner. He became so intox∣icated with power, as to entertain a design upon the throne, to depose his royal master, and to place over the <HI>Siamese, Monpi Totfo,</HI> son-in-law to the monarch, a phantom of a king, who was to be dependent on his will, and to be deposed as soon as affairs came to a crisis. The king was at that time extremely ill of a dropsy; on his decease, the whole royal lineage was to be put to death, and <HI>Phaulkon</HI> usurp the power.</P>
<P>IN order to accomplish his designs, it was necessary to call in foreign aid; he persuaded his weak master to send an embassy to <HI>Louis</HI> XIV. to request his most Christian Majesty to send persons qualified to instruct in the arts his unpolished subjects, so that he might shine pre-eminent among the Eastern nations. The first, who set out in 1680, were shipwrecked; the second arrived safe in 1686. The vanity of <HI>Louis</HI> made him receive with every mark of respect these grotesque legates; the memory of their recep∣tion is preserved in a medal
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Histoire de Medailles, tab. ccxvi.</NOTE>. The king is represented seated on his throne; the embassadors making their obeisance; above his majesty is inscribed <HI>Fama virtutis,</HI> intimating that the fame of his high qualities had induced them to come from this distant country. <HI>Louis,</HI> in compliance with the wish of the embassy, sent Jesuits, artists, and military officers; <HI>General de Fargues</HI> landed with several hundred soldiers, and was put into possession
<PB N="45" REF="61"/>of <HI>Bankok,</HI> the key of the kingdom, seated on the river, between the capital and the sea. Just as every thing was ready for exe∣cution, in May 1689, the plot was discovered; <HI>Monpi</HI> was seized by the king's son, and his head cast at <HI>Phaulkon</HI>'s feet. The mi∣nister, thus hurled from his greatness, was tortured and almost starved to death, then carried out of town, and beheaded; his body cut in two, and covered with a little earth, was soon de∣voured by the dogs; a sad proof how <HI>Ambitio male suada ruit.</HI></P>
<P>THE kingdom of <HI>Siam</HI> is divided from north to south by a long range of lofty mountains. On the west side,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">ACCOUNT OF SIAM.</NOTE> or next to the bay of <HI>Bengal,</HI> the country is visited by continual rains during the time the <HI>Monsoons</HI> blow from that quarter. On the eastern side no such deluges are known, nor any floods but what are the effects of the moderate inundations of the <HI>Meinam,</HI> which fertilize the country beyond description.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">FERTILITY.</NOTE> The useful grain rice is produced in amazing crops, and every delicate fruit of the <HI>Indies</HI> without cultivation. <HI>Raynal</HI> mentions among the productions of <HI>Siam,</HI> log-wood like that cut in <HI>Campeachy.</HI> It is a terrestrial paradise, but loses all its advantages by groaning under the most despotic government on earth. The monarch rules within his seraglio, and his grandees are let loose to oppress the wretched common∣alty, according to their caprice and unrestrained will. Domi∣nions thus governed, stretch near a thousand miles from north to south, or from Lat. 20° 35′ to Lat. 7° 0′, and in the broadest part extend three hundred and sixty.</P>
<P>THE religion of the country is the same with that inculcated by the <HI>Bramins;</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">RELIGION.</NOTE> but the <HI>Bramins</HI> of <HI>Siam</HI> are not a peculiar race, like those of <HI>Hindoostan;</HI> here every one who chuses as∣sumes
<PB N="46" REF="62"/>the priesthood; they usually lead a monastic life, and have their convents; those of each province are governed by a sort of bishop. Nuns or female monastics are frequent. The pagodas are of various forms, some have a great resemblance to the <HI>Chi∣nese</HI> architecture. The idols are monstrous in their appear∣ance.</P>
<P>THE first knowledge of the Christian religion was received by the mission of Jesuits,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">MISSIONARIES.</NOTE> led here under the conduct of <HI>Alexander</HI> of <HI>Rhodes,</HI> some time before the year 1658, when pope <HI>Alexander</HI> VII. sent over a reinforcement of religious men, but these being of other orders, were treated by the Jesuits with the utmost in∣dignity, nor would they condescend to permit them to share in their labors, which had been attended with prodigious suc∣cess. As to the message <HI>Louis</HI> XIV. sent by his embassador Mr. <HI>Chaumont,</HI> in 1684, modestly requesting his <HI>Siamese</HI> Majesty to become a good Catholic; he received this very proper reply,
<Q>that he left it to his most Christian Majesty to judge, whether a change of a religion that had been followed in his domi∣nions, without interruption, during two thousand two hun∣dred and twenty-nine years, could be a matter of small im∣portance to him, or a demand with which it was easy to com∣ply, and a matter which related entirely to <HI>God</HI> and not to him.</Q> This well might check the zeal of the missionaries; but in the next reign, on the discovery of the treachery of the <HI>French</HI> general, and the murder of <HI>Phaulkon,</HI> the whole troop of the religious were sent away, and all hopes of return entirely overthrown.</P>
<P>IN many respects the <HI>Siamese</HI> have an agreement with the
<PB N="47" REF="63"/><HI>Chinese;</HI> we must except their bodies, which are small. In their head-dress they agree in the pointed bonnet, in the frequent in∣habiting of ships and boats, and now and then in their orna∣mented architecture. The faces of the inhabitants are large,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">FORM OF THE SIAMESE.</NOTE> their cheek bones prominent, their foreheads and chins contract equally to a point; their cheeks hollow, their eyes small and ob∣lique, nose short and rounded; their ears long, by artificial dis∣tension; their complexions swarthy; their hair black and coarse, and would be extremely long, but that it is cut so very close that their heads seem beset with bristles; their teeth black from art.</P>
<P>IT is to be lamented, that so well informed a traveller as <HI>Koemp∣fer</HI> should not have left us any thing on the subject of the natural history of so fertile a kingdom; we have nothing to say of its vegetable productions, and as to its animals, we can only inform our readers that it swarms with elephants,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">ELEPHANTS.</NOTE> and that their teeth are a considerable article of commerce. In this tyrannous go∣vernment they are quite a pest; these, and other herbivorous beasts, destroy the labors of the husbandmen, and none dare re∣pel the attacks of those ravagers. Elephants are here only re∣served for state; the king keeps great numbers, and often makes them the instrument of his cruelty. They are the executioners of his wrath on his offending subjects, and are instructed how to put them to various kinds of death, either by trampling them under their broad feet, or deliberately tearing their limbs off with their lithe proboscis, or flinging them up into the air, and catching them empaled on their great tusks.</P>
<P>BUFFALOES and deer are found here in vast numbers;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">DEER.</NOTE> their
<PB N="48" REF="64"/>skins constitute a great article of commerce; fifty thousand of them have annually been sent to <HI>Japan</HI> through the medium of the <HI>Dutch. Mandelslo,</HI> a most intelligent traveller, gives the fol∣lowing account of the trade of <HI>Siam,</HI> as it was in the year 1639; speaking of the city of <HI>Juthia,</HI> he says,
<Q>the principal com∣merce consists in stuffs brought from <HI>Suratta</HI> and the coast of <HI>Coromandel,</HI> all sorts of <HI>Chinese</HI> commodities, precious stones, gold, benjamin, wax, copper, lead, indico, calamba-wood, brazil-wood, sapphires, rubies, &amp;c. but above all deer skins, whereof they furnish the <HI>Japanese</HI> with about fifty thousand every year. It likewise yields a great trade of rice, which they transport to all the neighboring isles.</Q></P>
<P>TO this we may add the more modern account of the rich productions of this kingdom,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">OTHER PRO∣DUCTIONS.</NOTE> taken from Mr. <HI>Dalrymple</HI>'s Reper∣tory
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 118.</NOTE>.
<Q>The productions of this country are prodigious quan∣tities of grain, cotton, benjamin, sandal, agualo, and sapan woods; antimony, tin, lead, iron, load-stones, gold and silver, sapphires, emeralds, agates, crystal, marble, and tambanck.</Q></P>
<P>HOGS and wild swine swarm in the dominions of <HI>Siam;</HI> most of the savage beasts of <HI>India</HI> are equally numerous in this king∣dom. <HI>Koempfer</HI> speaks of two species of monkies, one very large, and black, the other smaller, and of a grey color. The first seems a kind not well ascertained, for the only black monkey of the old world we are acquainted with, is that described by Mr. <HI>Edwards,</HI> tab. 311, which is no larger than a cat.</P>
<P>AFTER doubling cape <HI>Liant,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">RIVER OF LIANT.</NOTE> a bay opens to the north, and at the bottom receives the river of <HI>Liant.</HI> A vast chain of moun∣tains
<PB N="49" REF="65"/>which run from north to south, and unite with those of <HI>China</HI> in Lat. 22° 0′, divide the kingdom of <HI>Siam</HI> from the king∣doms of <HI>Laos</HI> and <HI>Cambodia,</HI> and almost reach the sea near the river of <HI>Liant.</HI> The upper part of this tract is in <HI>Laos,</HI> the more southern forms the kingdom of <HI>Cambodia,</HI> which is compared to a vast valley, bounded by the <HI>Siamese</HI> chain to the west, and that of <HI>Cochin-China</HI> to the east. The coast takes a south-eastern di∣rection from the bay of <HI>Liant</HI> as far as cape <HI>Cambodia,</HI> a space of three hundred miles, skirted by numbers of small isles washed by the bay of <HI>Siam.</HI> From the point of <HI>Liant</HI> is a sandy barren desert, reaching, according to <HI>Hamilton,</HI> as far as <HI>Ponteamas,</HI> above two-thirds of the coast.</P>
<P>THIS extensive tract has great scarcity of ports;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">PONTEAMAS.</NOTE> the most dis∣tinguished is that of <HI>Ponteamas,</HI> in Lat. 10° 45′. M. <HI>Le Poivre</HI> gives so enchanting a picture of this colony, that I will no more risque injuring it by the abridgment, than I did his history of the <HI>Malayes.</HI> His descriptions are so exquisite, that I must hope that they will not fall under a too frequent imputation on the writers of his lively nation, of being <HI>plus beau que la verité.</HI></P>
<P><Q>Departing, says M. <HI>Le Poivre,</HI> from the peninsula of <HI>Ma∣lacca,</HI> and the islands of the <HI>Malais,</HI> towards the north, I fell in with a small territory called <HI>Cancar,</HI> but known on the ma∣ritime charts under the name of <HI>Ponthiamas.</HI> Surrounded by the kingdom of <HI>Siam,</HI> where despotism and depopulation go hand in hand; the dominions of <HI>Camboya,</HI> where no idea of established government subsists; and the territories of the <HI>Malais,</HI> whose genius, perpetually agitated by their feudal laws, can endure peace neither at home nor abroad; this charming
<PB N="50" REF="66"/>country, about fifty years ago, was uncultivated and almost destitute of inhabitants.</Q></P>
<P><Q>A <HI>Chinese</HI> merchant, commander of a vessel which he em∣ployed in commerce, frequented these coasts; being a man of that intelligent reflective genius, which so characteristically marks his nation, he could not, without pain, behold immense tracts of ground condemned to sterility, though naturally more fertile than those which formed the riches of his own country; he formed, therefore, a plan for their improvement: with this view, having first of all hired a number of la∣borers, some <HI>Chinese,</HI> others from the neighboring nations, he, with great address, insinuated himself into the favor of the most powerful princes, who, for a certain subsidy, assigned him a guard for his protection.</Q></P>
<P><Q>IN the course of his voyage to <HI>Batavia,</HI> and the <HI>Philippine</HI> islands, he borrowed from the <HI>Europeans</HI> their most useful dis∣coveries and improvements, particularly the art of fortifica∣tion and defence; with regard to internal police, he gave the preference to the <HI>Chinese.</HI> The profits of his commerce soon enabled him to raise ramparts, sink ditches, and provide ar∣tillery; these preliminary precautions secured him from a <HI>coup de main,</HI> and protected him from the enterprizes of the surrounding nations of barbarians.</Q></P>
<P><Q>HE distributed the lands to his laborers, without the least reservation of any of those duties or taxes known by the names of service, or fines of alienation; duties which, by allowing no real property, become the most fatal scourge to agriculture, and is an idea which revolts against the common sense of
<PB N="51" REF="67"/>every wise nation. He provided his colonists at the same time with all sorts of instruments proper for the labor and improve∣ment of their grounds.</Q></P>
<P><Q>IN forming a laboring, and commercial people, he thought that no laws ought to be framed, but those which nature has established for the human race in every climate; he made these laws respected by obeying them first himself, and exhi∣biting an example of simplicity, industry, frugality, humanity, and good faith: he formed, then, no system of laws—he did more—he established morals.</Q></P>
<P><Q>HIS territories soon became the country of every industri∣ous man who wished to settle there; his port was open to all nations. The woods were cleared, the grounds judiciously labored, and sown with rice; canals cut from the rivers wa∣tered their fields; and plentiful harvests, after supplying them with subsistence, furnished an object of extensive commerce. His integrity, his moderation, and his humanity, made him re∣spected. He never wished to reign, but only to establish the empire of reason; his son, who now fills his place, inherits his virtues as well as his possessions; by agriculture, and the commerce he carries on with the produce of his lands, he has become so powerful, that the barbarians, his neighbors, stile him king, a title which he despises: he pretends to no right of sovereignty, but the noblest of all, that of doing good; happy in being the first laborer and the first merchant of his country, he merits, as well as his father, a title more glorious than that of king—the friend of mankind.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THE barbarians of the neighborhood, amazed to see abun∣dance
<PB N="52" REF="68"/>so suddenly succeed to sterility, flocked for subsistence to the magazines of <HI>Ponthiamas;</HI> whose dominions, at this day, are considered as the most plentiful granary of that eastern part of <HI>Asia;</HI> the <HI>Malais,</HI> the <HI>Cochin Chinese,</HI> the <HI>Siamese,</HI> whose countries are naturally so fertile, considering this little terri∣tory as the most certain resource against famine.</Q></P>
<P>LET me here add, that our plain <HI>Hamilton,</HI> who visited <HI>Ponte∣amas</HI> in 1720, found the town in ruins. It had been taken and plundered in the year 1717 by the <HI>Siamese</HI> fleet, at which time it was a place of considerable trade. It may have recovered by the time M. <HI>Le Poivre</HI> was there, so as to vindicate his enthusiastic account. The town is seated on a deep but narrow river, which in the season of inundations communicates with that of <HI>Meinam Kom,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">CAMBODIA.</NOTE> or <HI>Cambodia,</HI> and the city of the same name on its banks; by which means the commodities of the kingdom are sent to this port, in preference to that at the mouth of the <HI>Cambodia,</HI> which is said to be of very troublesome navigation, by reason of the numbers of low islands and sand banks which obstruct the channel.</P>
<P>IT is highly probable that such was the state of this river from the very early times; we find no antient port at this place, but learn from <HI>Ptolemy,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">CATTIGARA.</NOTE> that one, called <HI>Cattigara Sinarum Statio,</HI> stood on or near the scite of <HI>Ponteamas,</HI> on a marshy coast, pro∣ductive of reeds <HI>(bamboos)</HI> so large, that when they were joined and tied together, passengers were enabled to cross from one side to the other.</P>
<P><HI>Marcianus Heracleota,</HI> who wrote not long before the building of <HI>Constantinople,</HI> adds besides, that it stood on the river <HI>Cotiaris,</HI>
<PB N="53" REF="69"/>and was the termination of the known and habitable earth to the south. The <HI>Periplus</HI> of this geographer, may be found in the first volume of the <HI>Geographiae veteris Scriptores,</HI> published at <HI>Oxford</HI> in 1698.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Notium Promontorium,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">NOTIUM PROMONT.</NOTE> was to the north-west of <HI>Ponte∣amas.</HI> The bay mentioned by <HI>Marcianus Heracleota</HI> to be so in∣fested by wild beasts, and the part inhabited by the <HI>Ethiopian Icthyophagi,</HI> extended from that port to the south; cape <HI>Cambodia</HI> seems the <HI>Satyrorum Promontorium,</HI> probably because it was the haunt of some large species of monkey.</P>
<P>THE productions of the kingdom of <HI>Cambodia</HI> are gold and ivory in great abundance.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">PRODUCTIONS OF CAMBODIA.</NOTE> The <HI>Siamese,</HI> in their expedition of 1717, destroyed not less than two hundred tons that happened to be in the port, ready for exportation. <HI>Sandal</HI> wood, <HI>sapan</HI> wood, <HI>aloes</HI> wood, <HI>stick lac,</HI> and a great variety of drugs. <HI>Dampier</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Voy. Vol. ii. p. 105.</NOTE> adds rice, dragons blood, lac, i. e. varnish in large jars, which looked blackish and thick, and a yellow purging gum in great cakes called <HI>Cambodia,</HI> by which he certainly means gamboge. The whole country is prodigiously fertile, and yields almost every thing that the vegetable or animal kingdom produces in common with other parts of Eastern <HI>India.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Portuguese,</HI> says <HI>Mandelslo,</HI> were in possession of the com∣merce of <HI>Cambodia</HI> as late as the year 1639, notwithstanding every effort of the <HI>Dutch</HI> to come in for a share; but it must have been long enjoyed by the latter nation, after the fall of the <HI>Portuguese</HI> empire in <HI>India.</HI> The reigning prince in 1720, seemed very solicitous that the <HI>English</HI> should settle in his domi∣nions,
<PB N="54" REF="70"/>and offered to permit us to form factories and build forts to protect our trade. Mr. <HI>Bowyear</HI> (hereafter to be mentioned) says that the <HI>Cambodians</HI> resemble the <HI>Malays,</HI> whose language is generally understood in all these parts.</P>
<P>ABOUT two hundred <HI>Topasses</HI> or <HI>Indian Portuguese,</HI> were set∣tled and married in the capital of <HI>Cambodia</HI> when <HI>Hamilton</HI> was there, and seemed the only remains of that people. They all have small pensions from the king of the country; but in order to support themselves, are obliged to take to the chace of elephants, which they shoot, for the sake of their teeth, with iron slugs, poisoned by immersion in the thick bark of a certain tree; the beast is sure to fall in a short time after receiving its wound. The same method is used in killing the buffaloes on account of their tongues.</P>
<P>FROM cape <HI>Cambodia,</HI> the country bends due east; the river of the same name discharges itself into the sea, at the distance of about one hundred miles,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">CITY.</NOTE> through several mouths. The city stands ninety miles up the river, and consists of only one street, which is built on an eminence to preserve it from the annual in∣undations; the rains begin to fall in <HI>June,</HI> and continue during the months of <HI>July</HI> and <HI>August.</HI></P>
<P>THIS was near the scite of <HI>Thina Metropolis Sinarum</HI> of <HI>Pto∣lemy</HI> and <HI>Marcianus.</HI> Mr. <HI>Caverhill</HI> quotes <HI>Argensol</HI> for the proof, and says, on his authority, that marble ruins of an extensive city have been discovered to the north-west of <HI>Cambodia;</HI> yet <HI>Ptolemy</HI> relates that it was not surrounded with brazen walls, nor had any thing worth mentioning. <HI>Arrian,</HI> in his <HI>Periplus Maris Erythraei,</HI> calls it the greatest of the inland cities, and that it sent to <HI>Bary∣gaza,</HI>
<PB N="55" REF="71"/>the modern <HI>Barochia,</HI> on the western side of <HI>Hindoostan,</HI> wool, thread, and <HI>othonium sericum</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Outlines of the Globe, vol. i. p. 132.</NOTE>. These were carried the whole of the journey by men on foot; prodigious must it have been, if it is true that they went through <HI>Bactra,</HI> a detour of amazing extent.</P>
<P>THE kingdom of <HI>Cambodia</HI> was known to the <HI>Arabs</HI> by the name of <HI>Rachmi.</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">RACHMI.</NOTE> It was visited in the ninth century by two <HI>Arabian</HI> travellers, who report that the finest muslins in the world were made there, and that the natives wore garments so fine that they might be drawn through a middle sized ring. The same writers speak wonderful things of the <HI>Karkandan</HI> or unicorn, but from the whole description, it is evident that they mean no other ani∣mal than our one-horned rinoceros.</P>
<P>LET me conclude the account of the kingdom with saying,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">THE ANTIENT THINAE AND SINAE.</NOTE> that the antients comprehended under the name of <HI>Thinae</HI> and <HI>Sinae,</HI> not only <HI>Cambodia,</HI> but also <HI>Pegu, Siam, Laos, Cochin-China,</HI> and the more southern parts of <HI>China,</HI> of which <HI>Thina</HI> was the common capital.</P>
<P>THE noted island of <HI>Pulo Condore</HI> lies about fifteen leagues to the south of the western channel of the <HI>Cambodia.</HI> It is situated in Lat. 8° 40′, its form is that of a crescent; the length not above eight miles, the greatest breadth about two; the whole is lofty and mountanous, and surrounded by lesser isles; the name is derived from <HI>Pulo,</HI> an isle, and <HI>Condore</HI> a calabash, from its pro∣duction of that fruit. It is mentioned by a captain <HI>Saris,</HI> an <HI>Englishman,</HI> who sailed by it in 1605 in his way from <HI>Japan.</HI> The harbor is between the greater island and a lesser called the
<PB N="56" REF="72"/>little <HI>Condore,</HI> lying off the north end, in which is sufficient depth of water and safe anchorage. <HI>Dampier</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Voy. 288.</NOTE> in 1686 careened and refitted his ship here, and has given us a good account of many particulars. He says that the soil is rich and black, the hills craggy, the eastern part of the island sandy, but cloathed with trees of various kinds; some of the shores are rocky, others low and sandy. All the islands are finely watered with small ri∣vulets during ten months of the year, which begin to fail towards the latter end of <HI>March,</HI> in the dry season; but on digging, water may be found in many places.</P>
<P>THE vegetabled observed by <HI>Dampier</HI>
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dampier</HI> Vol. i. p. 314.</NOTE> were mangoes in a state of nature; the <HI>Areca Oleracea,</HI> or cabbage palm; the coco palm, wild nutmegs, grape trees, and a large tree four feet in diameter, which, on incision, yields a clammy juice, that, being boiled, proves an excellent tar, and on farther boiling becomes hard as pitch;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">DAMMER PITCH.</NOTE> this probably is the <HI>Dammer</HI>
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. Vol. i. p. 514.</NOTE> Captain <HI>Gore,</HI> in <HI>Cook</HI>'s last voyage
<NOTE PLACE="foot" N="‖">Voy. iii. 458.</NOTE>, adds to the list of plants, water melons, po∣tatoes, gourds, plantains, oranges, shaddocks, pomegranates, rice, and black beans. These, possibly, were acquisitions since the days of <HI>Dampier,</HI> and introduced by the <HI>French,</HI> who hu∣manely and politically wished to render these islands useful to navigators in their way to or from <HI>Japan, China, Manilla, Ton∣quin, Cochin-China,</HI> and many parts of <HI>India</HI> with which the <HI>Europeans</HI> have intercourse. At the time Captain <HI>Gore</HI> visited this island, a Mandarine from <HI>Saigore,</HI> came here with a certificate in <HI>French,</HI> from the bishop of <HI>Adran,</HI> a <HI>French∣man,</HI> certifying that he was sent in order to give his assistance
<PB N="57" REF="73"/>to any <HI>European</HI> ship which might touch at this port. <HI>Dampier</HI> recommended the erection of a fort, and mentions, among other advantages, that ships might in this island be supplied with masts and yards, possibly from the same tree which fur∣nishes the tar and pitch.</P>
<P>THE animals, when <HI>Dampier</HI> resided on the island,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">ANIMALS.</NOTE> were only hogs, lizards, and <HI>guanoes.</HI> Before Captain <HI>Gore</HI> reached <HI>Pulo Condore,</HI> it was plentifully stocked with buffaloes, transported from the continent, which increase here very successfully. Numbers of monkies inhabit the woods, and two species of squirrels, one of a beautiful shining black, the other of the kind called <HI>flying,</HI> striped brown and white, and probably a new species. <HI>Gaubil</HI> also observed rats with pendulous ears. To the reptiles we add, that father <HI>Gaubil</HI> saw here, in 1722, the flying dragon, or <HI>Draco-volans;</HI> a scaly species of lizard called <HI>Koka,</HI> from its piercing note resembling in sound that word; it resides in hollow trees; its bite is mortal. From these circumstances I suspect it to be the <HI>Gekko.</HI></P>
<P>HERE are a variety of parrots, paroquets, and pigeons, and in the woods numbers of poultry, in a state of nature. I refer the reader, for a further account, to page 262. vol. ii. of the Outlines of the Globe. The thrush, called by Mr. <HI>Latham</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. ii. p. 72.</NOTE> the <HI>Long∣tailed,</HI> may be added to the list of birds.</P>
<P><HI>Dampier</HI> found on the shores great plenty of the green turtle;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">TORTOISES.</NOTE> these he supposes to have been in a state of migration, being of opinion, that for want of food it is impossible for them to stay the whole year in the neighboring seas. Our great navigator
<PB N="58" REF="74"/>found them here from the 13th of <HI>March</HI> to the 21st of <HI>April.</HI> The natives of this island took them in large nets, and boiled the fat for the sake of the oil.</P>
<P>THE inhabitants of <HI>Pulo Condore,</HI> supposed to be originally of <HI>Cochin-China,</HI> are small in stature, of dark complexion, long visaged, with black and lank hair, white teeth, thin lips, small eyes, high noses. Their religion is idolatrous; they worship chiefly the elephant and the horse, similar to the objects of ado∣ration in <HI>Tonquin.</HI></P>
<P>IN 1702 <HI>Allan Ketchpole,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">ENGLISH SET∣TLEMENT.</NOTE> director of the <HI>English East India</HI> Company at <HI>Chusan,</HI> on the desertion of that settlement, made an attempt to form one here. He engaged in his service a num∣ber of <HI>Macassars,</HI> who were to act as soldiers, to assist in build∣ing, and to serve during three years. At the end of the term he basely refused to fulfil his contract. Those islanders, remarkable for the fidelity with which they execute all their agreements, are as determined to revenge any injuries offered to them: in the night they put to death <HI>Ketchpole,</HI> and most of the <HI>English;</HI> a few, on the first alarm, escaped in a boat. The <HI>Macassars</HI> re∣gained their liberty, and inflicted a most justifiable punishment on their persidious master.</P>
<P>HERE <HI>Dampier</HI>'s crew was welcomed by the people coming on board, and offering the free use of their women during their stay. This is a practice in <HI>Pegu, Siam,</HI> and other places in the parts of <HI>India cis Gangem. Prior,</HI> in his <HI>Alma,</HI> is very humorous on this subject, in the second canto:
<Q><L>In China, <HI>Dampier</HI>'s travels tell ye,</L>
<L>(Look in his index for <HI>Pagelli)</HI></L>
<L><PB N="59" REF="75"/>Soon as the British ships unmoor,</L>
<L>And jolly long boats row to shore;</L>
<L>Down come the nobles of the land,</L>
<L>Each brings his daughter in his hand;</L>
<L>Beseeching the imperious tar,</L>
<L>To make her but one hour his care.</L>
<L>The tender mother stands affrighted,</L>
<L>Lest her dear daughter should be slighted;</L>
<L>And poor Miss Yaya dreads the shame</L>
<L>Of going back the maid she came.</L></Q></P>
<P>ON returning to the estuaries of the river of <HI>Cambodia,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">CIAMPA.</NOTE> after a short journey eastward, we reach the small territory of <HI>Ciampa,</HI> or <HI>Bink Thoan,</HI> which extends about a hundred and fifty miles along the shore, the breadth does not exceed ninety. The abo∣riginal people, called <HI>Loyes,</HI> are large, muscular, and well made;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">LOVES, A PEO∣PLE.</NOTE> their complexions tinged with red, their noses somewhat flatted; their hair long and black; they have small whiskers, but scarcely any beards; their dress, a shirt and breeches of cotton, the last covered with a sort of petticoat of white cloth, fringed with silk, according to the circumstance of the wearer. They are go∣verned by a monarch who resides at <HI>Feneri,</HI> the capital of the country, in a mean palace, and with little state; he is in fact a tri∣butary to the king of <HI>Cochin-China,</HI> who sends a mandarine to re∣side at the court as president of the council, and without his ad∣vice nothing of moment is done. The productions of the country are very few; some cotton, indigo, and bad silk, for which they traffick with the <HI>Chinese.</HI> They are inferior to the <HI>Cochin-Chinese</HI> in their military, but excel them in naval affairs.
<PB N="60" REF="76"/>Their ships or jonks are tolerably well built; they are chiefly em∣ployed in fisheries, which are very considerable, and form their chief article of commerce. The <HI>Chinese</HI> send ships very fre∣quently to the northern ports of the country laden with tea, an inferior sort of silk, porcellane, and some other commodities of that empire. They take in return gold and <HI>columba</HI> wood, to be burnt on the tombs of their ancestors and relations, or before the altars of their divinities.</P>
<P>AMIDST the mountains inhabit a race of people named <HI>Moyes,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">MOYES.</NOTE> who go naked, excepting a cloth which is wrapped round their middle; they are employed in hard labor, and are little better than slaves. Both the <HI>Loyes</HI> and <HI>Moyes</HI> are regulated by the same laws; the government is very oppressive; they are punished for the least fault, and among the common people, that of shewing any appearance of wealth, is one of the first moment; the only good in the system of government is the toleration of religion. Here is found a degenerated <HI>Mahometanism;</HI> the doctrine of <HI>Con∣fucius;</HI> and idolatry, in all the variety and extravagancy of image worship. We know little of this country; I am obliged to M. <HI>Mannevillette</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 148.</NOTE> for my information, which he got from the cap∣tain of <HI>La Galathea,</HI> a <HI>French</HI> frigate which put into one of the ports of <HI>Ciamba</HI> in 1720, and was detained there for some time.</P>
<P>IN 1695 Mr. <HI>Higginson,</HI> president of <HI>Fort St. George,</HI> formed the idea of opening a trade with <HI>Ciampa,</HI> and sent Mr. <HI>Bowyear</HI> on a sort of embassy to the king of <HI>Cochin-China.</HI> At his court he met with the prince of this country, who gave him every encou∣ragement,
<PB N="61" REF="77"/>and told him he might, by the river <HI>Cambodia,</HI> dispose of great quantities of woollen-cloth among the <HI>Loyes.</HI></P>
<P>I MAY add here to my account of the river, that at the mouth is never less than four fathoms of water, and that it is navigable for ships of some burden up to the very capital, above which small vessels only are used, and the navigation is (by report) said to be interrupted by a cataract.</P>
<P>ACCORDING to <HI>D'Anville,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">COCHIN-CHINA.</NOTE> the kingdom of <HI>Cochin-China</HI> unites with its tributary <HI>Ciampa</HI> at the bay of <HI>Comorin;</HI> the original name is <HI>Anam.</HI> The <HI>Portuguese</HI> bestowed on it the appellation it bears at present, which, by the help of the <HI>Japanese</HI> word <HI>Cochi,</HI> signifies the country west of <HI>China.</HI> In describing the form of this extensive stripe of empire, I shall include in it, its <HI>les Pais conquis.</HI> The whole, beginning from the borders of <HI>Cambodia,</HI> is in form of a bow, bending into the ocean as far as <HI>Cape Varelle,</HI> in Lat. 13° 0′, when it inclines to its northern extremity in Lat. 17° 30′. The whole length of this great curvature is about six hundred and sixty miles, the breadth not exceeding that we have given to <HI>Ciampa.</HI> The northern borders are defended by a wall, which runs from the sea to the great chain of mountains, and forbids all approach from that quarter, as the inaccessible chain itself does every attempt of invasion from their western neigh∣bors. The <HI>Moyes,</HI> who inhabit these mountains, are said to be a most savage and ferocious race.</P>
<P>THE court of <HI>Cochin-China</HI> is usually held at <HI>Sinoa;</HI> a little to the south of the wall there, says Mr. <HI>Bowyear,</HI> the king, in his <HI>Tongtan</HI> or eighth moon, takes his recreation with his Mandarines, and forbids all interruption by petitions or any sort of business.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="78"/>ALL the lower part of the kingdom has its annual inundations,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">INUNDATED.</NOTE> like the other tropical countries, which give it prodigious ferti∣lity. <HI>Borri</HI>'s account of the peculiarity of the floods in this king∣dom is very curious. The rains on the mountains during the wet season are intermittent; they happen once a fortnight, and last three days at a time, bringing fertility and plenty to the subjacent country. This rain is called <HI>Lut;</HI> its arrival is cele∣brated by every one, from the king to the peasant, with the ut∣most festivity. The overflowing of the <HI>Nile</HI> is not received in <HI>Egypt</HI> with greater rapture. The seasons in <HI>Cochin-China</HI> may be called four. The violent heats last during <HI>May, June,</HI> and <HI>July;</HI> the rains fall in <HI>September, October,</HI> and <HI>November,</HI> and ab ae the violence of the sun. In <HI>December, January,</HI> and <HI>February,</HI> the cold northern winds prevale, accompanied by cooling showers. In <HI>March, April,</HI> and <HI>May,</HI> all the beauties of spring appear, and the fruits of every kind of vegetation bless the country.</P>
<P>THE great harvest is that of rice;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">RICE.</NOTE> two species are cultivated on the mountanous and dry soils; one as white as snow, and when dressed, of a slimy viscous nature, made into pastes, such as ver∣micelli and the like. Both these kinds are exported to <HI>China</HI> in great quantities; the different sorts of rice are the staples of this country.</P>
<P>THE sugar-cane is another plant to which the <HI>Cochin-Chinese</HI> pay the utmost attention,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">SUGAR.</NOTE> and cultivate in vast abundance. They are acquainted with most of the processes, and annually manufacture great quantities of both white and brown sugars, so that their country supplies <HI>China</HI> with the principal part of this article, that vast empire not producing sufficient for its own
<PB N="63" REF="79"/>consumption. The city of <HI>Faifo</HI> or <HI>Foy Foe,</HI> is the <HI>emporium</HI> from which the <HI>Chinese</HI> annually export about forty thousand barrels, each weighing above two thousand pounds. To the credit of these orientalists, all the cultivation, and all the posterior processes in the production of the sugar, is the voluntary labor of freemen.</P>
<P>To these articles of commerce may be added woods of different kinds, such as aloes wood, or <HI>Agollocha,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">AGOLLOCHA.</NOTE> erroneously called <HI>Eagle∣wood, Columba,</HI> and others of value, either in mechanics, or for their sweet scent.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">COLUMBA WOODS.</NOTE> The price of <HI>Columba</HI> wood on the very spot is five ducats a pound, at the ports sixteen, and in <HI>Japan,</HI> to which much is exported, two hundred. A pillow of this wood is the highest luxury with the orientalists, particularly the <HI>Japanese,</HI> who will give three or four hundred ducats per pound for a piece big enough for that purpose. The <HI>Agollocha</HI> bears a good price; great quantities being shipped for <HI>Hindoostan,</HI> for the use of the <HI>Hindoos</HI> to burn their dead, who seem to emulate the an∣tient <HI>Romans</HI> in the aromatic profusion of their funeral piles.</P>
<P>PEPPER grows here in abundance.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">PEPPER.</NOTE> <HI>Le Poivre</HI> and <HI>Raynal</HI> mention that cinnamon, superior to that of <HI>Ceylon,</HI> is found on a certain mountain, for which the <HI>Chinese</HI> pay a higher price than for that brought from the famous staple of that spice. <HI>Cassia</HI> is another spice; let me question whether the two are not con∣founded.</P>
<P>COTTON is much cultivated, as is the mulberry tree,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">COTTON.</NOTE> for the use of the silk-worms; great quantities of coarse silks are made here, some so strong as to serve for sails and cordage, but the finest sorts also are manufactured. The imposing <HI>Chinese</HI> export
<PB N="64" REF="80"/>from hence the fibres of a tree called <HI>Pitre,</HI> which they fraudu∣lently mix with their own manufactures; they even import into their land of tea a course and black sort; possibly for the sake of enabling them to export their own, at greater profit, into our island. The mountains yield some gold, and much iron; the natives fuse the last, and employ the metal in various manufac∣tories: raw and wrought silk may be added to the articles of commerce.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Portuguese</HI> had once considerable influence in the court of <HI>Cochin-China;</HI> the <HI>Dutch</HI> made a strong effort to come in for a share of the commercial emoluments, but were expelled the kingdom by the superior interest of their rivals. At present, it is said, that the trade is chiefly in the hands of the <HI>Japanese</HI> and <HI>Chinese,</HI> who are settled at <HI>Foy Foe,</HI> and preserve their own laws, religion, and customs. The harbors are still casually frequented by <HI>European</HI> ships, but, I think, their imports inconsiderable.</P>
<P>THE chief port is that of <HI>Foy Foe,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">PORT OF FOY FOE.</NOTE> some miles up a navigable river. The entrance has before it, at a little distance, the isles of <HI>Champellos;</HI> the channel between the mouths and the town is filled with islands, and obstructed by a bar, but not unsurmount∣able. Ships of some burden formerly have been brought over, and then were obliged to anchor before the custom-house, which was the case with Mr. <HI>Bowyear.</HI> The town consists but of two rows of houses, inhabited by <HI>Chinese</HI> and a few <HI>Japanese;</HI> the first of whom manage the trade, and import various articles from <HI>Canton, Siam, Camboja, Batavia,</HI> and <HI>Manilla; Bowyear</HI> met with encouragement to settle a factory near the city, but I be∣lieve it never was carried into effect.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="81"/>THIS country is certainly very favorable to trade and naviga∣tion, having not fewer than sixty safe harbors, and a great depth of water in every part.</P>
<P>THE gallies or shipping of the <HI>Cochin-Chinese</HI> are very nu∣merous;

Notwith∣standing the <HI>Cochin-Chinese</HI> can neither cast cannon or make fusils, their dexterity, says Mr. <HI>Borri</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Churchill's Col. vl. ii. 806.</NOTE>, in the art of gunnery is amazing; not one of our <HI>Europeans</HI> dare enter the list with them. The navy of this country is quickly manned, every fa∣mily being bound to furnish a sailor, who serves with great ala∣crity, for they are well treated, and their wives and children supported during their absence; all are dressed in an uniform, and when they are about to engage, put on a gilt helmet and a cloak, which leaves their right arm quite bare. Numbers of their vessels are employed in the fisheries; the fish are found in vast abundance, and form a great article of commerce; fish and rice constitute the principal food of the <HI>Cochin-Chinese.</HI></P>
<P>THE woods and mountains afford all the variety of birds and quadrupeds of the adjacent kingdoms;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">ELEPHANTS.</NOTE> tigers swarm; elephants are in great abundance and of vast size; these are taken and reclamed; numbers are kept in the royal stables merely for ostentation, being no longer used in war; they are rendered of infinite service to the inhabitants of the country as beasts of burden, the carriers both by land and water, I may say the stage coaches and ferries of <HI>Cochin-China.</HI> On their backs is
<PB N="66" REF="82"/>placed a machine like the body of a coach; reckoning the outside as well as inside they convey thirteen or fourteen passengers; when they arrive at a river, they take the water very readily, and will even carry their fare in perfect safety over an arm of the sea a mile wide.</P>
<P>A GREAT monkey called here the <HI>Douc,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">MONKEY.</NOTE> by me the <HI>Cochin-China,</HI> Hist. Quad. ii. N<SUP>o</SUP> 125, is found of the length of four feet exclusive of the tail. The tail and lower parts of the arms are pure white; the crown, upper parts of the arms and thighs black, buttocks clothed with hair, round the neck a collar of purplish brown; the face bordered up to the eyes with a great yellowish beard. It is also found in <HI>Madagascar,</HI> where it is called <HI>Sifac;</HI> it walks often erect; its food beans.</P>
<P>I BEG not to be understood to favor the doctrine of some system-makers, by connecting the description of the monkey of <HI>Cochin-China</HI> with that of the man. I readily allow changelings, or ar∣tificial monkies among our species, but none that are natural; we have also our bears. As to the men of this country, they greatly resemble the <HI>Chinese,</HI> from whom they are distantly sprung; they are featured exactly like them, but are less in body, more active and more valiant; the complexion of those on the coast is olive, that of the inland or alpine inhabitants is fairer, and not inferior to that of <HI>Europeans.</HI></P>
<P>IT is this country that produces in such quantities the <HI>edible birds</HI> nests, held by the epicure of the East to be the first of deli∣cacies. It is chiefly made use of in soups and ragouts of chickens; the nests are first softened in water, pulled to pieces, and mixed with ginseng, put into the body of the fowl. The
<PB N="67" REF="83"/>above is then to be stewed in a pot with a sufficient quantity of water, and left on the coals the whole night. The best kinds which are white, and quite pure from dirt, are dissolved in broths in order to thicken them, and to give them that flavor the Orientalists so much admire. Of the black and foul nests is made glue.</P>
<P>MR. <HI>Latham</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. ii. 579.</NOTE> gives the following account:
<Q>It weighs about half an ounce, and is in shape like half a lemon, or, as some compare it, to that of a saucer, with one side flatted where it adheres to the rock. The texture of it is somewhat like <HI>Isin∣glass,</HI> or rather more like fine <HI>Gum-dragon,</HI> and the several layers of the matter it is composed of very apparent; being fabricated from repeated parcels of a soft slimy substance, in the same manner as the martins form theirs of mud. Authors differ much as to the materials of which it is composed; some suppose it to consist of <HI>sea-worms</HI> of the <HI>Mollusca</HI> class; others of the <HI>sea-qualm</HI> (a kind of cuttle fish) or a glutinous sea-plant called <HI>Agal Agal.</HI> It has also been supposed that they rob other birds of their eggs, and, after breaking the shells, apply the white of them for that purpose.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THESE nests are found in vast numbers in certain caverns in various isles in the <HI>Soolo Archipelago,</HI> situated between Longi∣tude 117° and 120′, Lat. 5 and 7; particularly in three small isles or rather rocks, in the caverns of which the nests are found fixed to the sides in astonishing numbers. They are also found in amazing quantities on a small island called
<PB N="68" REF="84"/><HI>Toc,</HI> in the streights of <HI>Sunda,</HI> the caverns of which are lined with the nests, but no where in greater abundance than about <HI>Croee,</HI> near the south end of <HI>Sumatra,</HI> four miles up a river of that name; but they are not peculiar to the above places; for they are likewise common from <HI>Java</HI> to <HI>Cochin-China</HI> on the north, and from the point of <HI>Sumatra</HI> west, where it is called <HI>Layung,</HI> to <HI>New Guinea</HI> on the east, where the sea is said to be covered with a viscous substance like half melted glue, which the bird is supposed either to take up from the surface with its bill during flight, or to pick it from the rocks when left there by the waves.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THE best nests, or those of a pure white, and free from mixture, sell in <HI>China</HI> from 1,000 to 1,500 dollars the <HI>picle,</HI> the black and dirty ones for only twenty dollars. The last are supposed to arise from age, mixed with dirt, or feathers; and the gatherers beat down all the black ones they can get at, in hopes that, from the necessity of the birds making fresh nests, they may meet with the more valuable ones at the next ga∣thering. It is said, that the <HI>Dutch</HI> alone export from <HI>Batavia</HI> 1,000 picles of these nests every year, which are brought from the isles of <HI>Cochin-China,</HI> and those lying to the east of them. Among our <HI>East India</HI> imports, it is much to be wondered, that, among other luxuries imported by us from the East, the use of these nests should not have found a way to our tables; as yet being so scarce in <HI>England,</HI> as to be kept as rarities in the cabinets of collectors.</Q></P>
<P>THE king resides generally at <HI>Whay,</HI>

The city is extensive; the palace a large square, the streets near it wide, long, and regular; the rest of the city consists of straggling houses; several branches of the river meet here; every family keeps its covered boat; and there are numbers besides kept for hire, for most of the conveyance is by water. It is a place of great trade, both from <HI>Kankao,</HI> and all parts of their own coasts.</P>
<P>THE celebrated M. <HI>Le Poivre</HI> was here in 1749, and appeared at court with great splendor
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Oriental Repertory, 251.</NOTE>, bearing a letter from the king of <HI>France,</HI> and some very paltry gifts for the <HI>Cochin-Chinese</HI> mo∣narch. <HI>Le Poivre</HI> was too open, and boasted so much of his <HI>Grand Monarque,</HI> that his veracity was called in question, and in the end he and his countrymen forced to make a hasty retreat.</P>
<P>THE government of <HI>Cochin-China</HI> is monarchical.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">GOVERNMENT OF COCHIN-CHINA.</NOTE> It had once been a province to <HI>Tonquin,</HI> but was separated from it in the beginning of the last century. The story is differently re∣lated. I refer the reader to <HI>Hamilton</HI>'s account
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Vol. ii. 211.</NOTE> of the cause and manner: <HI>Le Poivre</HI> relates it differently; yet both may be right in the chief circumstances of the event. The ruling re∣ligion is that of the <HI>Chinese,</HI> not the pure and primaeval worship of the <HI>Shangti,</HI> the patriarchal religion; but that of <HI>China</HI> in its corrupted state. Christianity (introduced by the <HI>Portuguese</HI> during the time of their favor at the court of <HI>Cochin-China</HI>) got ground for some little time: missionaries were sent, churches
<PB N="70" REF="86"/>erected, and multitudes of converts made. At length a king arose unfriendly to our doctrine, who expelled the missionaries, and compelled his subjects to return within the pale of the na∣tional church. Having premised this, I shall treat the reader with <HI>Le Poivre</HI>'s elegant account of the revolution, and the happy state of this kingdom; but I must mix my fears with it, that as he hints at corruptions creeping fast into the original system of government, it may be found at present as absolute, as tyrannical, and as absurd as other eastern dominions, under the rule of the infirm individual. To begin,</P>
<P><Q>A <HI>Tonquinese</HI> prince, unsuccessful in a war he carried on against the king of <HI>Tonquin</HI> (under whom he enjoyed an office somewhat resembling the <HI>Maires de palais</HI> under the <HI>Merovingian</HI> race of the kings of <HI>France</HI>) retired with his soldiers and adherents across the river which divides that kingdom from <HI>Cochin-China.</HI> The savages, who then possessed this country, fled before these strangers, and took refuge among the mountains of <HI>Tsiampa.</HI> After a long war with their old enemies, who pursued them, the <HI>Tonquinese</HI> fugi∣tives remained at length peaceable possessors of the country known under the name of <HI>Cochin-China;</HI> it extends about two hundred leagues from north to south, but narrow and unequal from east to west. They then applied themselves entirely to the cultivation of rice, which, being the ordinary food of the inhabitants of <HI>Asia,</HI> is to them an object of the greatest importance. They separated into little cantonments, and established themselves on the plains, which extend along the banks of the rivers.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="87"/><Q>THE six first kings, founders of this monarchy, governed the nation as a father governs his family; they established the laws of nature alone; they themselves paid the first obedience to them. Chiefs of an immense family of laborers, they gave the first example of labor; they honored and encouraged agriculture, as the most useful and honorable employment of mankind. They required from their subjects only a small annual free-gift to defray the expence of their defensive war against their <HI>Tonquinese</HI> enemies.</Q></P>
<P>OFF the coast of <HI>Cochin-China</HI> are the <HI>Paracels,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">THE PARACELS.</NOTE> a vast tract of rocks, reefs, sand-banks, and small isles, extending from north to south from Lat. 12° 10′ N. to 16° 45′ N. two hun∣dred and seventy-six miles in length, and sixty in breadth. To the north-east of the northern end is a group of small reefs and rocks, called the <HI>Triangles,</HI> and again a little to the south-east of that is a great irregularly shaped shoal, called the <HI>Macclesfield</HI> shoal. Between these and the isle of <HI>Hainan,</HI> belonging to <HI>China,</HI> is clear and deep water. That island lies to the north, about one hundred and thirty miles from the nearest extremity of the <HI>Pa∣racels;</HI> the interval is the common passage of our ships bound for <HI>China;</HI> they sail between the coast of <HI>Cochin-China</HI> and the <HI>Paracels,</HI> till they get sight of the <HI>Campellos</HI> isles in Lat. 16° 10′. From thence they cross over towards <HI>Hainan,</HI> which is strongly marked by several very high and craggy mountains, foresights of the general nature of the great empire.</P>
<P><HI>Tinhosa</HI> is the next point navigators make for, a small but lofty isle not remote from <HI>Hainan,</HI> and from thence is a direct and clear course to the islands of <HI>Sanciam;</HI> a little beyond
<PB N="72" REF="88"/>which is that of <HI>Macao,</HI> and the numerous isles that bound the channels to the great port of <HI>Canton.</HI></P>
<P>THE bay of <HI>Tonquin</HI> begins near the wall of <HI>Cochin-China,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">BAY OF TONQUIN.</NOTE> and at the northern extremity of that kingdom. The entrance is bounded on the eastern side by the island of <HI>Hainan.</HI> The middle of the bay has very deep water, and is free from isles, excepting a small one called the <HI>Nachtigael;</HI> but the shores are skirted with sands, or groups of little isles; the coasts them∣selves, according to <HI>Dampier,</HI> very low; and the whole interior a flat of the richest soil, productive of all the fruits, and possibly vegetables, of the tropics. Pastures or rice ground border the banks of the most considerable rivers.</P>
<P>THE great orange <HI>Cam-chain</HI> has a thick rind and rough;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">FRUITS.</NOTE> the inside of an amber color; the smell is most fragrant; the taste most delicious</P>
<P>THE <HI>Cam-quit</HI> is very small, round, and of a deep red. The taste is equal to the former, but is esteemed a more un∣wholesome fruit, as it both creates and heightens the disorder of the flux. The limes are equal in size to lemons. The <HI>betel</HI> is said to surpass any of the <HI>Indian.</HI></P>
<P>THE mulberry is much cultivated here for the nourishment of the silkworms.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">MULBERRY.</NOTE> There is a succession of them, for the leaves of the old trees are held to be less nutritive to the worm, and productive of worse silk. The species of <HI>Morus</HI> is generally sup∣posed to be the white.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Rhus Vernix</HI> is found here and in several other parts of <HI>India citra Gangem.</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">RHUS VERNIX.</NOTE> It is the valuable tree which yields the varnish so useful in the lacquering of variety of things, and giv∣ing
<PB N="73" REF="89"/>them a sort of immortality; the best is in <HI>Japan.</HI> The reader may satisfy his curiosity further by consulting <HI>Thunberg, Flora Japon.</HI> p. 121. <HI>Koempfer</HI>'s travels, i. 114. and his <HI>Amaen. Acad.</HI> 791. fig. 792. <HI>Kalm</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. i. 77.</NOTE> found it in <HI>North America,</HI> and mentions it under the name of the <HI>poison</HI> tree. It certainly merits the title, but its effects are not general; some persons can receive its juice on the body or hands without the least ill con∣sequence, while others are afflicted with violent swelling, acute pains, and blisters so numerous that the patient will resemble a leper, and his very skin peel off; some people are even struck with blindness for two days together; much depends on the constitutions of those affected. There are men that will handle the tree, or touch the juice with impunity; while others will be visited with all the deleterious symptoms by being in the way of the smoke, or even of the wind which carries the effluvia or exhalations of this singular tree.</P>
<P>IT has been observed that the workers in <HI>Laquer</HI> or <HI>Japan,</HI> feel the bad effects, being subject to violent eruptions, in form of boils or blotches. The laborers can only work in the dry season, when the north winds blow. They are obliged to lay several coats on, each of which must have time to dry, before the other is applied. The varnish is brought to market in great tubs all the working season, the natural color is white, and thick like cream, but changes in the air, and becomes blackish; <HI>Dam∣pier</HI> says that the <HI>Tonquinese</HI> have the art of making of it a glue the best in the world.</P>
<P>IN this kingdom are abundance of sir and poon trees,
<PB N="74" REF="90"/>both which are very serviceable for masts. The country also produces <HI>Sappan</HI>-wood,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">SAPPAN WOOD.</NOTE> which <HI>Dampier</HI> compares to the <HI>Log∣wood</HI> of <HI>Campeachy.</HI> It proves to be the <HI>Caju Sappan,</HI> or <HI>Lignum Sapan</HI> of <HI>Rumphius,</HI> iv. 56. tab. xxi. <HI>Ligno Brasiliano Simile, Bau∣hin.

This tree grows principally in <HI>Siam</HI> and <HI>Ciamba;</HI> is of the first use in <HI>India</HI> for the dying of red. <HI>Rumphius</HI> gives a very full account of the means by which it produces a tinge of different shades. It is also brought to the <HI>European</HI> market. It grows to a moderate size; the branches are thick set with short spines. The wood is very hard, and much used by the <HI>Indians</HI> for pegs to fasten the boards of their ships. This plant has been introduced into the <HI>Kew garden,</HI> and is described by Mr. <HI>Aiton</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hort. Kew. ii. 55.</NOTE> under the name of <HI>Caesalpina vesicaria,</HI> narrow-leaved prickly Brasiletto.</P>
<P>THE zoology of <HI>Tonquin</HI> would give a most plentiful harvest; here seems to be a continuation of most of the animals of the countries of <HI>India</HI> we have passed over.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">ELEPHANTS.</NOTE> The elephants are ge∣nerally in a state of nature; they are very wild and shy; but when taken their flesh is eagerly sought after; the trunk is a peculiar dainty: The king keeps a few for state; when one happens to die, the flesh is given to the poor, and the trunk cut to pieces and sent to the mandarines; horse-flesh is also fre∣quently brought to market. This favors of Tartarian origin.</P>
<P>THE variety of birds,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">BIRDS;</NOTE> terrestrial and aquatic, is incredible. The water fowl pair before <HI>May,</HI> and fly in pairs during the months of <HI>June</HI> and <HI>July.</HI> From <HI>October</HI> to <HI>March</HI> they collect in vast
<PB N="75" REF="91"/>flocks. The <HI>Tonquinese</HI> take them in nets set on poles, which the birds strike on in the twilight.</P>
<P>FISH is in equal abundance.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">SOYA SAUCE.</NOTE> That delicate sauce we call <HI>Soya</HI> is made here of one species; and of a sort of shrimp, is pro∣duced another relishing luxury called <HI>Balichaun.</HI></P>
<P>THE chief river of the country is called the river of <HI>Tonquin,</HI> which empties itself into the bay by two channels, one called <HI>Rok-ho,</HI> the other twenty leagues to the north-east, which <HI>Dam∣pier</HI> named that of <HI>Domea.</HI> The first, frequented by the smaller vessels, has not above twelve feet water at the entrance, and is the most convenient for the <HI>Siamese</HI> and <HI>Chinese.</HI> The other is used by the <HI>European</HI> ships on account of the depth. Before the mouth is a line of hard sand two miles long; the entrance is distinguished by a high ridgy mountain far up the country called the <HI>Elephant.</HI> About six leagues from the mouth of the river is the village of <HI>Domea,</HI> usually consisting of a hundred houses, yet on the arrival of the <HI>European</HI> ships it soon increases to a large town; the natives resort for sake of trade from all parts; houses suddenly spring up; for being only constructed of frames of bamboo, and the roof of palm or other leaves, a tem∣porary town is quickly formed, in which a fair is kept as long as the ships remain in the harbor.</P>
<P>THE river is subject to the same periodical floods as others in the tropical regions; and the same fertility is the consequence. The wet season commences the latter end of <HI>April</HI> or beginning of <HI>May,</HI> and lasts till towards the close of <HI>August.</HI> The rains are intermittent; some are of two or three days continuance, others of only a few hours, with intervals of fine weather, especially
<PB N="76" REF="92"/>towards the beginning and conclusion of the season. During the wet months the heat is intolerable, especially when the sun can force its rays through the thick clouds.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Typhons,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">TYPHONS.</NOTE> or as <HI>Dampier</HI> calls them <HI>Tuffoons,</HI> are most tremendous in this bay and on the coast of <HI>China.</HI> They pre∣vale in the months of <HI>July, August,</HI> and <HI>September,</HI> and com∣monly near the change of the moon. They are preceded by very fine weather; a presaging cloud appears in the north-east, black near the horizon, edged with copper color, on the upper part fading into a glaring white. It often exhibits a ghastly appearance twelve hours before the <HI>Typhon</HI> bursts; its rage lasts many hours from the north-east, attended with dreadful claps of thunder, large and frequent flashes of lightning, and ex∣cessive hard rains; then it sinks into a dead clam; after which it begins again with redoubled rage from the south-west, and continues an equal length of time.</P>
<P>THE great <HI>Halley</HI> gives an account of the surprising tides in this bay;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">TIDES.</NOTE> each flux is of twelve hours duration, and its re-flux the same, so that there occurs but one high water in twenty-four hours. The great Philosopher shall speak in his own words:</P>
<P><Q>ON the first and second days, at the water's increase, the in∣fluxes are very small and uncertain, but afterwards the tides for thirteen days are constant in their course, one flood and one ebbing being completed in twenty-four hours time, equally sharing the space of a lunar circuition of the earth between them, and every flood beginning nearest three quarters of an hour later than the precedent flood, and also considerably in∣creasing in the height of the tide every day, from the third unto
<PB N="77" REF="93"/>the sixth and seventh days of the water's age, on which two days the flood runs very high; but on the eighth day (which may be accounted the last of the spring tides) the waters be∣gin gradually to decrease again, retaining the same orderly dif∣ference of time in each tide, until the next following first day of the water's increase; when, during two days unsettledness, there is a shifting of the tides in respect of the beginning of the flood and ebb, after which said shifting, a constancy in their inverted course is again retained in the above mentioned order for thirteen days following.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Cachao,</HI> the principal city of <HI>Tonquin,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">CITY OF CACHAO.</NOTE> lies about eighty miles higher up the river, and is the place where the chief trade is carried on. The imports are conveyed from the ships in large <HI>Tonquinese</HI> boats, navigated by the natives. The tide runs with great rapidity thirty or forty miles above <HI>Domea,</HI> through a rich and beautiful plain; near <HI>Hean,</HI> a town of two thousand houses, is the place where the two channels meet, and form the <HI>Delta</HI> of <HI>Tonquin,</HI> about eighty miles from the sea. The <HI>Chinese</HI> mer∣chants have a street to themselves at <HI>Hean.</HI> For a time they re∣sided at <HI>Cachao,</HI> but became so numerous that they seemed to swallow up the very natives; the king therefore ordered them to remove here. The <HI>French</HI> also had a factory in this town in <HI>Dampier</HI>'s time. Is is from that honest voyager I take my ac∣count, having no later authority of any authenticity. The <HI>Chi∣nese</HI> and <HI>Siamese</HI> jonks come up as high as the town, and ride in the middle of the river.</P>
<P><HI>Cachao</HI> is a city of twenty thousand houses; the walls usually made of mud and thatch, but some are of brick, covered with
<PB N="78" REF="94"/>tiles. Here are three regal places; two very mean, the third more magnificent, but built of timber, and open at the sides. This, with the courts, fish-ponds, and docks for the pleasure boats, take up a vast space of ground, surrounded by a wall faced with brick. There are several gates, and stairs to ascend to the top of the walls, round which is a pleasant walk. This place is the residence or rather prison of the <HI>Boua,</HI> or em∣peror of <HI>Tonquin.</HI> In this country is a most singular govern∣ment; by a revolution which happened long ago, the general of the reigning monarch made himself master of the empire; he assumed all the regal power, and seized the whole revenue, but did not venture to extirpate the royal family, for fear of the af∣fection the people entertained for their antient rulers. The executive power is lodged in the general or his heirs, who is called <HI>Choua;</HI> he is quite absolute, has his guards, and all the insignia of majesty. The <HI>Boua</HI> is kept as a state prisoner, with his wives and children, and diverts himself within the palace walls, for he is never allowed to stir out. The <HI>Choua</HI> pays him all external respects, visits him three times a year, gives him the precedence, makes him a tender of his life and services, and de∣clares that all he does is in kindness, to save him the fatigues of government. The <HI>Choua</HI> places his own creatures about him, and no others are permitted to have access.</P>
<P>THE <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> have or had factories in this city.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">FACTORIES.</NOTE> I am not well acquainted with the exports of the country; they are said to be gold, woods for dying, raw and wrought silk, some callicoes, varnish, turpentine, salt, earthen ware, anniseed, and drugs of several kinds; pearls are also found on the coasts.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="95"/>THE royal navy is an affair of state, useless and contemptible in wars; and as to ships of commerce, there are scarcely any; so that every thing is brought in and out of the kingdom in foreign bottoms.</P>
<P>I MAY be pardoned for digressing to the healing art of the <HI>Tonquinese.</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">TONQUIN MEDICINE.</NOTE> I must produce their receipt for the cure of the bite of the mad dog, the gaol distemper, and other maladies incident to human nature; let the good intent apologize for the following extract, thought worthy of a place in the eleventh volume
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 1051.</NOTE> of the Philosophical Transactions.</P>
<P>THEY <HI>(the Tonquinese)</HI> take of the best musk about gr. xvi. of the purest native cinnabar, and finest vermillion, each about gr. xxiv. and, having reduced them separately to impalpable pow∣ders, mix and administer them in about a gill of arrack; which, in two or three hours, generally throws the patient into a sound sleep and perspiration; if not, they repeat the dose, and think the cure certain.</P>
<P>THE religion of this country is the same with that of <HI>Cochin-China,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">RELIGION.</NOTE> but idolatry appears here with much less magnificence; the <HI>Pagodas</HI> are mean, and their images numerous. It should seem that the <HI>Mandarines</HI> and better sort of people are more en∣lightened, and confine themselves to the worship of one GOD. They do not frequent the pagodas, they have no idols, but adore the supreme in their courts, with uplifted eyes. A person of the family reads the petition to heaven. <HI>Dampier</HI>'s
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Vol. ii. 58.</NOTE> account of the ceremony is curious; "When they make this petition," says he,
<Q>they order a great deal of good meat to be dressed, and calling
<PB N="80" REF="96"/>all their servants into the court where the ceremony is to be performed, they place the food on a table, where also two in∣cense-pots are placed, and then the mandarine presents a paper to the clerk, who reads it with an audible voice. In the first place, there is drawn up an ample account of all that GOD has blest him withal, as health, riches, honor, favor of his prince, &amp;c. and long life, if he be old; and towards the conclusion, there is a petition to GOD for a continuance of all these bles∣sings, and a further augmentation of them; especially with long life, and favor of his prince, which last they esteem as the greatest of all blessings. While this paper is reading, the master kneels down, and bows his face to the earth, and when the clerk has done reading it, he puts it to the burning rushes, that are in the incense-pot, where it is consumed; then he flings in three or four little bundles of sacred paper, which is very fine and gilded; and when that also is burnt, he bids his servants eat the meat.</Q></P>
<P>IT is singular that in matters relative to their oaths of allegi∣ance,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">OATH.</NOTE> a species of sacrament is annually performed, at the season in which the <HI>Mandarines</HI> receive from the great officers under them the oath of fidelity to the king; this is attended with the following ceremony: they cut the throat of a hen, and let the blood fall into a bason of arrack; of which every man has a small portion given him to drink, after he has publicly declared his loyalty and zeal to serve his prince; and this is esteemed the most solemn tie by which any person can engage himself.</P>
<P>THE Christian religion made considerable progress in this kingdom about the year 1680,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">MISSIONARIES.</NOTE> and some time after. Here were

The priests were all masters of some mechanic arts which were useful in this country, and which seem to have been the grounds of their toleration. By reason of some imprudence on their part, or some spirit of persecution in the reigning powers, they were at length expelled; and four of the principal missionaries put to death by decapitation.</P>
<P>I WILL conclude with the extent of the kingdom of <HI>Tonquin,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">EXTENT.</NOTE> and with a brief account of the inhabitants. It commences towards the south at the <HI>Cochin-China</HI> wall, and is there very narrow; to the west it is bounded by the <HI>Cochin-Chinese</HI> chain, which soon re∣tires, and gradually leaves a larger and larger expanse to the great plain of this kingdom. These mountains keeping to the north∣west unite with those of <HI>China,</HI> and by their branches turning east∣ward, constitute the boundaries between <HI>Tonquin,</HI> and the mighty empire of which the <HI>Tonquinese</HI> seem originally to have been a colony. The western limit is at the river <HI>Gannan Kyan,</HI> in Lat. 21° 35′.</P>
<P>THE province bordering on <HI>China</HI> on the side of the bay is that of <HI>Tenan,</HI> small, but extremely fertile in rice; off the coast are multitudes of isles, very properly called, by the <HI>Dutch,</HI> the <HI>Islands of Pirates.</HI> They are inhabited by fishermen, who make no scruple of robbing every ship they can master. Those can
<PB N="82" REF="98"/>only be of the most defenceless kind, for these pirates have no other vessels than the boats in which they carry on the fishing business, and those unprovided with any sort of fire-arms. From the extreme corruption of the government, there is no redress to be obtained against their excesses. An <HI>English</HI> captain has been fined for killing one of the crew of these petty thieves which had shewed a design of attacking his vessel.</P>
<P>IN one of the isles the <HI>Tonquinese</HI> have a custom-house, which is said to bring in a million of rix-dollars.</P>
<P>THE kingdom is very populous,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">NATIVES.</NOTE> being thick set with villages. The natives generally are of a middle stature, of the tawny <HI>India</HI> color, but the fairest and clearest of the kind; a blush or change of tint may be seen in some of them on any surprise of passion, imperceptible in any other <HI>Indians;</HI> their faces are flat∣tish and oval, their noses and lips of due proportions, and alto∣gether agreeable; their hair black, long, and lank, very thick, and hanging down to their shoulders.</P>
<P>THEIR teeth are (like those of the <HI>Siamese</HI>) as black as art can make them;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">BLACK TEETH.</NOTE> the dying occupies three or four days, and is done to both boys and girls when they are about twelve or four∣teen years old; during the whole operation they never take any nourishment, except of the liquid kind, for fear of being poi∣soned by the pigment, if they swallowed what required mastica∣tion. Every person, high and low, rich and poor, is obliged to undergo this severe operation, alledging it would be a disgrace to human nature to have teeth white as those of dogs or ele∣phants, to which they compare those who labor under that misfortune.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="99"/><HI>Prior,</HI> with his usual humour, mentions this custom, but transfers it to the <HI>Chinese.</HI></P>
<Q><L>In <HI>China</HI> none hold women sweet,</L>
<L>Unless their snags are black as jet:</L>
<L>King <HI>Chihu</HI> put nine queens to death,</L>
<L>Convict on statute iv'ry teeth.</L></Q>
<P>THUS ends my account of <HI>India extra Gangem.</HI> The <HI>Ton∣quinese</HI> have so much similitude with the <HI>Chinese,</HI> that it is with some reluctance I place them as a separate people. The uni∣formity of manners, the religion, and even the personal appear∣ance begin to shew themselves far more to the south. The <HI>Chi∣nese</HI> had spread themselves to many of the kingdoms we have passed over, and the likeness is retained in proportion as they kept distinct, or mixed with the natives, so as to occasion a devi∣ation from their native features and national customs. We fall in with the general arrangement of geographers, and leave the artificial distinctions which separate them from that great em∣pire whence they originated. The antients thought otherwise, and formed of those kingdoms a mighty government, distin∣guished from their neighbors to the south and to the north by the general name of <HI>Thinae</HI> or <HI>Sinae.</HI></P>

<P>THE miracle of governments!
<NOTE PLACE="marg">GOVERNMENT.</NOTE> Its dominion extends from the streights of <HI>Hainan,</HI> in north Lat. 20° 13′, to the extre∣mity of the province of <HI>Pe-che-li,</HI> in Lat. 41° 15′, comprehend∣ing a space of near fifteen hundred miles in length, and in breadth above a thousand. The numbers of its inhabitants (given by the lively <HI>Voltaire</HI>) are a hundred and fifty millions
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The more accurate information obtained by Lord Macartney's embassy, makes the popu∣lation of <HI>China</HI> Proper amount to 333,000,000, inhabiting a space of 1,297,999 square miles. E.</NOTE>, yet all are ruled by a single man! The government is founded on the law of the <HI>fifth commandment,</HI> and the honor paid to the emperor in the character of father, amounts to a veneration due to the Divinity himself. The greatest of his subjects never speak to him without kneeling; his words are law, and every thing he says is received as oracular. The same respect, proportion∣ably diminished, is rendered to all his servants, as emanations of his sacred person, from the first mandarine down to the lowest officer who is invested with delegated power. He is called <HI>Tyen-tse,</HI> the son of Heaven; <HI>Thau-ting,</HI> palace royal; <HI>Van-swi,</HI> ten thousand years; and by other epithets emblematic of the
<PB N="88" REF="102"/>sanctity of his person. All this results primarily from the sense of filial duties, early imprinted on the hearts of his subjects as the first and greatest point of religion, and objects of the cogni∣zance of the magistrate. If a son is incorrigible by a parent, the parent takes him before the judge, who seldom fails to bring him to a sense of his duty. Filial respect, says <HI>Confucius,</HI> in his <HI>Auking,</HI> a book on that very subject, is the foundation of all virtue, and of the wise government of the empire.</P>
<P>CHILDREN are treated by the parents with the utmost rigor; the doctrine of obedience is inculcated with the greatest severity, so that it becomes ever after habitual: but as this respect to∣wards their superiors is attended with fear and meanness, so deceit and fraud become the characteristics of the <HI>Chinese</HI> nation.</P>
<P>THE same respect to those in a higher station pervades all ranks of people; hence the <HI>Chinese</HI> are the most ceremonious of man∣kind, and the very lowest orders full of the most profound arti∣ficial civility.</P>
<P>THE emperor has the disposal of all offices, nay, even of the lives and fortunes of every subject. Nothing is done, of any moment, from one extremity to the other of this vast empire, without his knowledge; in criminal cases the calendar of pri∣soners convict are laid before him, with a statement of their crimes; these lists are returned to the respective judges, with the sentence affixed to each name, be it of death or free pardon. The lesser punishments are left to the pleasure of the ma∣gistrate.</P>
<P>THE despotism of the emperor is founded upon law and custom;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">DESPOTIC.</NOTE> not expressed, yet fully implied, it seems admitted that
<PB N="89" REF="103"/>he can do no wrong! but it is on the principle that the state is a vast family, that <HI>Tyen, i. e.</HI> the Supreme Being, hath placed him on the throne, in order that he may be a father and a mother to his people. In consequence of this, a strong sense of his duty is continually before his eyes. The mandarines and princes of the blood are at liberty to remind him of any faults he may fall into; and even the people, if they find him negligent, are as ready to become tumultuous as in any other country. The grand secret of government in the emperor is the unremitting attention paid to the conduct of the mandarines and other magistrates, who are carefully watched, and most severely punished on every failure of duty. He himself is perpetually anxious to consult the good of his subjects, and to avoid incurring their hatred or contempt.</P>
<P>THERE is no country in which the filial duties are carried to such a length.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">FILIAL DUTIES.</NOTE> "A veneration for fathers," says <HI>Montesquieu</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Spirit of Laws, vol. i. p. 433.</NOTE>,
<Q>was necessarily connected with a suitable respect for all who represented fathers, such as old men, masters, magistrates, and the emperor. This respect for fathers, supposed a return of love towards children, and consequently the same return from old men to the young, from magistrates to those who were under their jurisdiction, and from the emperor to his subjects. This formed the rites, and these rites the general spirit of the nation.</Q></P>
<P>A PARRICIDE is extremely rare in this empire: whenever it happens, the whole province is in alarm; the relations are pu∣nished, and the mandarines deposed, as it is presumed it must
<PB N="90" REF="104"/>have been through their neglect of admonition on the first appearance of filial misconduct, that such a monster could be found. The emperor himself is judge, and the crime is expiated by the sentence of the criminal being cut into ten thousand pieces.</P>
<P>THE reigning vice of the <HI>Chinese</HI> is self-interest,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">SELF-INTEREST.</NOTE> which gives rise to the infinite variety of frauds of which they are justly ac∣cused. Lord <HI>Anson</HI>'s account of them is by no means exag∣gerated. Attempts have been made to clear them from the aspersion, but all has proved a vain labor. They consider the art of over-reaching as a mark of superior genius, and laugh at their dupe for suffering himself to be imposed on. <HI>Du Halde</HI> tells a pleasant story of an <HI>English</HI> captain who had bargained with a <HI>Chinese</HI> merchant for several bales of silk. On opening the first, he found it excellent; but all the rest were quite rotten. The captain reproached the merchant in the most severe terms. The <HI>Chinese,</HI> with great coolness, answered,
<Q>Blame, Sir, your rogue of an interpreter, for he assured me, that you never would ex∣amine the bales.</Q></P>
<P>PRIDE and self-conceit are the other characteristic faults of this people.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">PRIDE.</NOTE> They assume an imaginary pre-eminence over all the world, and conceive nothing can be right but what they do. Their arts and their inventions have been brought to a certain point, at which they must ever stop, till they can prevale on themselves to lower their high opinion of superiority, and im∣prove upon the models brought from <HI>Europe.</HI> They can copy, but they do it with reluctance, as they look upon them∣selves to be the first of men. A good effect arises out of this
<PB N="91" REF="105"/>foible, it represses luxury; they think themselves wiser than the rest of mankind, and that they are supplied with whatever their situation can require. Their rule of government, their customs, their arts, their habits, have remained for centuries the same, and probably will continue so to the end of time.</P>
<P>THIS leading feature is, besides,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">ANTIQUITY.</NOTE> the result of the high and just opinion they entertain of the antiquity of the <HI>Chinese</HI> nation, in comparison of that of the rest of the world; and they with truth observe, that they were a polished people ages before the nations of modern <HI>Europe</HI> had emerged from savage manners and pro∣found ignorance.</P>
<P>THE founder of their empire is said to be <HI>Fo-hi,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">FO-HI, FOUNDER OF THE EMPIRE.</NOTE> cotemporary with <HI>Phaleg</HI> and <HI>Heber.</HI> His subjects at that time were nearly in the state of nature; they fed on what they caught, ate it raw, drank the blood, and clothed themselves with the skins. He taught them to make fishing-nets and snares for birds, to rear domestic animals, and instructed them in various arts of life; and to soften the fierceness of his people, invented music, and the instrument <HI>Kin. China</HI> was inhabited above two thousand years before the Christian aera, demonstrable from an eclipse ob∣served at that period. The boast of the <HI>Chinese</HI> is, that their mo∣narchy has continued four thousand years under the government of emperors; that it experienced twenty-two dynasties or revo∣lutions, but the commotions each occasioned were so short that the country suffered very little inconveniency, and returned im∣mediately into its former regular system.</P>
<P>THE original religion of the <HI>Chinese</HI> was truly pure,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">RELIGION.</NOTE> and pro∣bably delivered to them by the first founder of the empire,
<PB N="92" REF="106"/><HI>Fo-hi,</HI> as derived from the patriarchs, amongst whom that illus∣trious character may nearly be ranked. The first who reached <HI>China</HI> brought with them the religion of <HI>Noah.</HI> They acknow∣ledged one great and supreme Being, and professed to live ac∣cording to his laws engraven on their hearts. They justly made that Being the model of perfection, possessed of omnipotence, omniscience, providence, goodness, justice, and mercy. They admit the doctrine of grace, for they say that the most wicked man, if he makes use of the assistance offered to him by <HI>Tyen,</HI> or the Supreme Being, may attain the highest virtues. They hold also an expiation of sins by their own sacrifices; but confess that no external adoration will be accepted unless it is attended with inward sentiments, and comes directly from the heart. I cannot, in my contracted plan, give all the detail of their reli∣gion, or the proofs of its origin from the patriarchs. I will only say, that, like them, they had their <HI>Pentateuch.</HI> Their <HI>five vo∣lumes</HI> correspondent with the <HI>Mosaical</HI> history are esteemed by them the source of all science and morality.</P>
<P>The great reformer of the religion of <HI>China</HI> was <HI>Consucius,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">CONFUCIUS.</NOTE> cotemporary with <HI>Pythagoras,</HI> and born 551 years before Christ; he purged it from all corruptions, and brought it to the perfection we have described; it still continues the religion of the emperor and of the good and learned throughout his vast dominions.</P>
<P>ABOUT six hundred years before the Christian aera,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">SECT OF TAUT-SE.</NOTE> arose the sect of <HI>Taut-se,</HI> founded by <HI>Lau-kyun,</HI> who confined the felicity of this life to voluptuousness; and taught that the soul died with the body; yet at the same time admitted the existence of a Divine Being, which makes some people believe, that his doc∣trine
<PB N="93" REF="107"/>had been corrupted by certain of his profligate disciples, who might think it better to perish than burn; yet as they must necessarily be perpetually disturbed with the thoughts of death, they pretended to have invented a liquor of immortality, which, with the credulity of some of the emperors, gave a prodigious increase to their followers; they were greatly addicted to magic, introduced worship of spirits, sacrificed to devils, and deluded the vulgar by a thousand juggling tricks.</P>
<P>THE last was the sect of <HI>Fo</HI> or <HI>Fwe</HI> (not to be confounded with the great <HI>Fo-hi.</HI>)
<NOTE PLACE="marg">SECT OF FO.</NOTE> Their doctrine was transported out of <HI>India</HI> about 65 years after the birth of Christ. An emperor dreamed of a saying of <HI>Confucius,</HI> that the <HI>Holy-one</HI> was to be found in the West. He sent ambassadors to <HI>India,</HI> who brought back the monstrous image <HI>Fo,</HI> and all the extravagances of the <HI>Hindoo</HI> mythology. Temples or pagodas were erected in all places, and those filled with the most monstrous idols. They were attended by <HI>Bonzees</HI> innumerable. This is the religion of the vulgar, but not always confined to them; the emperors have at times been infected with it, deceived by the seeming austerities practised by the <HI>Bonzees,</HI> and their senseless penances, similar to those of some of the <HI>Indian Faquirs.</HI></P>
<P>THE Christian religion was introduced here as early as the year 636, when, to the astonishment of the <HI>Chinese,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHRISTIANITY.</NOTE> there ap∣peared among them a set of men with fair hair and blue eyes, and of an air, form, and habit quite unknown. These proved to be certain bishops, priests, and deacons sent out of <HI>Judea</HI> to propagate the gospel in these distant parts. They were <HI>Syrians</HI>
<PB N="94" REF="108"/>and <HI>Nestorians.</HI> At that time <HI>Jesuiabas,</HI> says <HI>Mosheim</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. ii. p. 1.</NOTE>, was at the head of that sect. The memory of this transaction was quite lost for ages, till in the year 1625 a monument was found in digging under ground near <HI>Si-ngan-su,</HI> in the province <HI>Shensi.</HI> It was a table of marble, ten feet long and five broad, containing the names of the missionaries, and a history of the cause of their coming, written in the <HI>Syriac</HI> language, which was translated by the Jesuits who happened to be in <HI>China</HI> at the time of its dis∣covery, and is given in <HI>Kircher</HI>'s <HI>China Illustrata.</HI> There is no doubt of the authenticity. The Jesuits are charged with a most useless and unavaling forgery, especially by <HI>Voltaire.</HI> The curious may see more of the affair in <HI>Renaudot</HI>'s account of <HI>India</HI> and <HI>China</HI>
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Trans. Pt. ii. p. 76 et seq.</NOTE>. The effect of this mission did not continue long; at first they made abundance of proselytes; they were favored by the reigning emperor, permitted to build churches, and inculcate their doctrine among his subjects. This monu∣ment brings down their history to 783, the time of its being made. In the year 845, an emperor inimical to the monastic life arose, and by an ordinance entirely suppressed every religious house. This was in fact levelled at the <HI>Bonzees,</HI> and the professors of the idolatry of <HI>Fo</HI> or <HI>Fwe,</HI> who had not only ex∣pended vast sums in the ornaments of their pagodas and monas∣teries,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">CONVENTS.</NOTE> but made them sanctuaries for all kinds of profligates. This event corresponds exactly with our celebrated dissolution: here four thousand six hundred of the great monasteries of male and female recluses, and forty thousand of the lesser, were directed to be demolished, the lands and revenues to revert to the royal
<PB N="95" REF="109"/>domain, and a hundred and fifty thousand slaves belonging to the houses to be set at liberty, enrolled and ranked among the people. As to these Christians, who in the ordinance are called outlandish <HI>Bonzees</HI> from <HI>Ta-tsing</HI> or <HI>Mu-hu-pa,</HI> about three thou∣sand in number, they were also included, and directed to return to a secular life, "to the end that the customs of our empire," says the decree, "may be uniform and unmixed." From this time the history of these people was consigned to oblivion, nor ever would have been known, but for the discovery of the <HI>Si∣gnan-su</HI> monument.</P>
<P>THE ambition of the great Jesuit St.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">ST. FRANCIS DE XAVIER.</NOTE> <HI>Francis de Xavier</HI> to ex∣tend the power and importance of his new order, is mentioned largely at vol. i. p. 113. of this work.</P>
<P>IN 1549 he sailed from <HI>Goa</HI> to <HI>Japan,</HI> and after discharging his mission in that island, determined on a visit to <HI>China.</HI> Death frustrated his pious design, but preserved him from the mortifi∣cation of being refused an entrance into the empire, according to the most rigid ordinances then in force. He departed this life off the isle of <HI>Sancian.</HI> The <HI>Chinese</HI> had no objection to receive a dead christian; they permitted his interment; his coffin was filled with unslacked lime, which miraculously lost its nature, and the body, preserved uninjured, was found entire, sweet, and with all moisture, fifty years after, <HI>(Du Halde</HI> says only as many months) and brought with due veneration to the city of <HI>Goa.</HI></P>
<P>FROM this period to the end of the same century,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">JESUITS.</NOTE> no attempt was made to follow the great example of St. <HI>Xavier.</HI> A few <HI>Do∣minicans</HI>
<PB N="96" REF="110"/>and <HI>Franciscans</HI> would have landed in <HI>China</HI> with the same pious intention, could they have obtained leave. The honor of preaching the gospel with any success in this great empire, was reserved for the rising order of the Jesuits.</P>
<P><HI>Valignon,</HI> superior general of the order of the mission of <HI>India,</HI> resident at <HI>Macao,</HI> burning with zeal for the great design, selected three of his society for the purpose, <HI>Roger</HI> of <HI>Naples, Pasio</HI> of <HI>Bologna,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">FATHER RICCI.</NOTE> and <HI>Ricci</HI> of <HI>Macerata.</HI> The last was a man of superior abilities, who with his two brethren had rendered themselves masters of the <HI>Chinese</HI> language at <HI>Goa,</HI> before they began their mission. They entered on it in the year 1583. After several un∣favorable essays, <HI>Ricci</HI> found his way to the court; he had all the art and insinuation of his order; a noble air, great sweetness of temper, and an extensive knowlege of the sciences, par∣ticularly of the mathematics. He came also provided with pre∣sents; he gave the emperor a clock, a picture of our Saviour, and another of the Virgin, each of which, say the Jesuits, had a most honorable place. <HI>Pasio</HI> and <HI>Roger</HI> had been recalled, and the whole power was vested in <HI>Ricci;</HI> under whom crowds of subordinate Jesuits preached the gospel with the utmost success. They seemed to have a toleration, or at least a connivance. They reconciled the doctrine of their great master, and the rites of the Christian religion, with the ceremonies of that of <HI>China. Ricci</HI> permitted his proselytes to assist at the annual commemoration of the followers of <HI>Consucius,</HI> and to intermingle the rites of both churches, so as to gain converts innumerable. He baptized several Mandarines and persous of rank; among others two rich
<PB N="97" REF="111"/>widows, one by the name of <HI>Candida,</HI> the other that of <HI>Agatha.</HI> The wealthy founded churches; and the poor filled them with their numbers. Persecutions were raised against them; but the abilities of <HI>Ricci</HI> overcame them all. He died highly respected, in 1610, at <HI>Peking,</HI> in the reign of <HI>Van Lye;</HI> and by the order of the emperor was most honorably interred in a garden allotted for that purpose. <HI>Ricci</HI> incontestibly merited the title he re∣ceived, of founder and father of the <HI>Chinese</HI> church.</P>
<P>SEVERAL other Jesuits of great abilities successively supported his labors; a persecution had been raised against them, but luck∣ily at the same time an invasion was threatened by the <HI>Tartars.</HI> A Mandarine, a Christian convert, advised the calling in the as∣sistance of the <HI>Portuguese</HI> engineers to direct the artillery; the ad∣vice was taken, and their success again brought the Christians into favor.</P>
<P>FATHER <HI>Schaal</HI> was employed in casting of cannon,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">FATHER VERBIEST.</NOTE> and father <HI>Verbiest,</HI> another Jesuit of first rate abilities, was engaged in the same service. It certainly was not the spiritual merits of the fa∣thers that gained them the patronage of the <HI>Chinese</HI> emperors, but their knowlege of the arts. They had brethren of all pro∣sessions, painters, mechanics, turners, watch-makers, founders, accomptants, astronomers, and masters of ordnance. <HI>Verbiest,</HI> and some of the ablest of the fathers, were consulted about mat∣ters of state; and by those various means became a most pow∣erful ministry. They were created Mandarines, and appeared at court in a rich dress of that order, with the dragon flaming on their breasts. <HI>Cam-hi</HI> even issued an edict in favor of the Christian
<PB N="98" REF="112"/>religion. Among the miracles of the times, an eunuch converted fifty ladies; and <HI>Helena Taming,</HI> empress of <HI>China,</HI> held episto∣lary correspondence with pope <HI>Alexander</HI> VIIth.</P>
<P>UNFORTUNATELY for the Jesuits, in 1631, an inundation of other missionaries poured into the empire.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">DOMINICANS.</NOTE> The <HI>Dominicans</HI> and the <HI>Franciscans</HI> were zealous to partake of the honor, and share in the good work; but again, unluckily for both, the Jesuits were more of this world, their rivals of the other. The last soon discovered the arts by which the Jesuits had established their power in <HI>China.</HI> They would not condescend to preach any but the pure doctrine of Christianity; an inveterate quarrel ensued among these holy men. The <HI>Dominicans</HI> and <HI>Francis∣cans</HI> carried their complaints to <HI>Rome;</HI> the grounds of which were discussed in the highest ecclesiastical courts, and with va∣rious success. The monks had the most subtile orders to coun∣teract them. The controversy lasted a hundred years; bulls had been sent to <HI>Peking,</HI> to disannul all the temporizing compliances of the Jesuits with the religious rites of the <HI>Chinese;</HI> some they evaded, and at other times, by their power at court, excited perse∣cutions against their christian brethren. They even procured the imprisonment of <HI>Tournon,</HI> a legate from the Pope himself. His holiness honored the sufferer with the cardinal's hat; he re∣ceived it in consinement, and soon after died, the ridicule of the political Jesuits. The reader will find a very candid and enter∣taining account of the Christian church by <HI>Moshcim,</HI> in the <HI>Chi∣nese</HI> Miscellanies, published in 1762, in two small volumes. My plan forbids me from entering further into the history; let it
<PB N="99" REF="113"/>suffice to say, that the Jesuits, from the death of <HI>Kam-hi,</HI> expe∣rienced vicissitudes of fortune; were either depressed or exalted according to the genius of his successors, or according to the uses to which they were found subservient. The dissolution of the order probably put an end to the Christian church in this poli∣tical empire

<P>ANOTHER nation, eminent for extending their religion far and wide, could never effect, by the power of the sword, what this artful order did by insinuation, and by temporizing with the customs and manners of the people of whom they intended to make their advantages. The <HI>Arabs,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">ARABS.</NOTE> who in other places incul∣cated the doctrine of their famed impostor by conquest and vio∣lence, here never made the attempt; long masters of the sea, they came from the coasts of <HI>Africa,</HI> or of <HI>Arabia</HI> and <HI>India,</HI> in the form of traders, in the tenth century. The <HI>Chinese</HI> admitted them into their ports in that character, but denied them permis∣sion to propagate their faith, as they had done in <HI>India.</HI> They were strictly forbidden to make any converts, but were allowed the free exercise of their own religion, as long as they did not in∣terfere with that of the empire. The <HI>Portuguese,</HI> when they first arrived in <HI>China,</HI> found the cities full of <HI>Arabs</HI> or <HI>Moors,</HI> and Fa∣ther <HI>Navarette,</HI> a <HI>Dominican</HI> missionary in <HI>China</HI> in 1665, informs us, that in his time there were about five hundred thousand, which had greatly increased by intermarriages with the natives; that many of them took their degrees among the <HI>Chinese</HI> literati;
<PB N="100" REF="114"/>which evinces how the <HI>Arabs</HI> carried with them a thirst after knowledge; but they were looked on by their brethren as apo∣states, for mingling with a nation whose rites were so contrary to their own.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the <HI>Mahometans</HI> have been settled so many centuries in <HI>China,</HI> they are in many places considered as intruders, are treated most contemptuously by the vulgar, and sometimes their mosques have been demolished by the mob.</P>
<P>LET me now return to the temporal concerns of the <HI>Chinese</HI> empire.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">LAST REVO∣LUTION.</NOTE> The last revolution was effected in 1644. The em∣peror <HI>Tsong-Ching,</HI> reduced to despair by a successful rebellion, put himself to death; his brave general made head against the usurper, but unfortunately, like our <HI>Vortigern,</HI> called in the as∣sistance of a foreign power; he invoked the <HI>Manchew Tartars,</HI> who, headed by their monarch <HI>Tsong-te,</HI> united with him, and expelled the usurper. <HI>Tsong-te</HI> died as soon as that was effected; but before his death, declared his infant son emperor of <HI>China.</HI> The general found his error too late, yet submitted to the neces∣sity, and supported the new succession. From that time the <HI>Tartar</HI> line continued on the throne; but the prince, and all the <HI>Tartarian</HI> subjects he brought with him, adopted, in the most mi∣nute articles, the antient rules of the empire, its laws and customs, and assumed the habits of the conquered people. <HI>Tartars</HI> and <HI>Chinese</HI> are admitted indifferently to places of trust civil and mi∣litary. The <HI>Tartars</HI> compose most of the garrisons, but are now grown as effeminate as the <HI>Chinese</HI> themselves, and very little su∣perior to the native soldiery. The army of <HI>China</HI> consists of
<PB N="101" REF="115"/>seven hundred thousand men, dispersed in garrisons, or along the great wall; are well cloathed and armed, and make a fine figure on a review or on a march.</P>
<P>THE characteristic features of the <HI>Chinese</HI> in the males,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">FORM OF THE CHINESE.</NOTE> are a large forehead, short nose, well cut small eyes, a large and square face, great broad ears, a middle sized mouth, black hair, and a large and fat body. These constitute beauty in our sex. The com∣plexions in general are as fair as <HI>Europeans,</HI> unless in the southern provinces, or among the rank of people who are obliged to be exposed to the open air.</P>
<P>THE noses of the females are short, their eyes little, their ears long, their complexions ruddy, their features regular, and coun∣tenances gay; their feet artificially small.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">LITTLE FEET.</NOTE> It has ever been the custom of the nurses to bind those parts so close, as to prevent them from growing; they esteem this a beauty, notwithstanding it gives them a lameness in their gait; yet they think the small∣ness of their feet a charm, and shew them as much as pos∣sible.</P>
<P>I SHALL now speak of the genius of this singular people,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">ARTS.</NOTE> and the progress they have made in the arts.</P>
<P>I WILL begin with the medical.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">MEDICAL.</NOTE> All their <HI>Materia Medica</HI> answers to our <HI>Galenical</HI> medicines, being drawn from simples; they have a good knowledge of the uses of the vegetable king∣dom. They never meddle with the violent remedies; gentle cathartics, emollients, strengtheners, are the kinds they principally prescribe. Green and bohea tea, the <HI>Ginseng,</HI> and other salutary roots, are much in use. They are totally ignorant of anatomy, but pretend to great sagacity in the knowledge of the pulse; they
<PB N="102" REF="116"/>not only judge of the species and nature of the disease, but ap∣ply their remedy according to the symptoms it exhibits. I refer to <HI>Du Halde</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. ii. p. 183.</NOTE>, for the long but curious account of the practice. They were well acquainted with the circulation of the blood, long before the <HI>Europeans</HI> attained that knowlege. As they know nothing of anatomy, it must be by reasoning on the force and action of the pulse. They bleed, even with a bit of broken china.</P>
<P>THEY had the knowlege of inoculation a great many years ago;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">INOCULATION.</NOTE> it is a disputed point whether the <HI>Turks</HI> (from whom we learned the salutary art) received it from the <HI>Chinese,</HI> by means of the <HI>Armenian</HI> caravans, or whether the same people might not have communicated it to the <HI>Chinese;</HI> certain it is that they have long been in possession of the method; and the emperor <HI>Kam-hi</HI> made a noble use of it, sending skilful persons into <HI>Tartary,</HI> and other parts of his dominions, to inoculate the children of his <HI>Tartarian</HI> subjects, and others; the distemper in every part of the empire being dreaded to the highest degree, making the same havoc among these eastern people, as the plague in the western world.</P>
<P>THE art of printing was invented under the emperor <HI>Ming-Tsong,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">PRINTING.</NOTE> about the year of our Lord 904, being above five hundred years before it was discovered in <HI>Europe.</HI> They trace the types through the written copy on blocks of wood; so never have occasion to break the press, as we do in our quarter of the globe.</P>
<P>THE manufacture of paper was originally discovered by <HI>Tsay-Jun,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">PAPER.</NOTE>
<PB N="103" REF="117"/>a great Mandarine of the palace, A. D. 95, who made it nearly in the manner we do, from old fragments of cloth or silk, and the bark of trees, boiled and reduced to a thin paste. The consumption of paper in this empire is prodigious; the <HI>Cacoethes Scribendi</HI> occasions an amazing demand, and the quantity used for the papering of their rooms is inconceivable. Their painted papers are more famed for the richness of the colors, than the justness and elegance of the design. They have no notion of perspective, nor the least skill in delineating the human figure, all which appear like so many caricatures. The subjects are chiefly domestic scenes, agriculture, such as the cultivation of rice, &amp;c. &amp;c. of tea, and the various processes, from the planting to the package for foreign markets.</P>
<P>THE consumption of ink must necessarily be equal to that of paper; the manufacture employs, in the province of <HI>Nanquin,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">INK.</NOTE> whole villages; lamp-black is the basis, whether of the liquid ink used for printing, or of that which is brought over to us under the name of <HI>Indian</HI> ink, in sticks, with <HI>Chinese</HI> characters, and ornamented with colored figures of flowers, &amp;c. The in∣vention of ink in <HI>China,</HI> is said to have been in the reign of <HI>Ven-ti,</HI> about a hundred and sixty years before Christ.</P>
<P>THE emperor <HI>Kam-hi</HI> caused the wars against the <HI>Elaths,</HI> and those on the frontiers of little <HI>Bucharia,</HI> to be painted, and sent long after into <HI>Europe,</HI> in order to be engraven by the best ar∣tists; these were the performances of the Jesuits, and done in a very good manner. They were placed in the hands of <HI>Le Bas</HI> at <HI>Paris,</HI> and engraven in 1770; the plates were sent to <HI>China;</HI> but because the figures in the back grounds were not drawn as large
<PB N="104" REF="118"/>as those in the fore, the plates were returned to be altered (which was done) quite to the taste of the <HI>Chinese.</HI> The mountain scenery is magnificent; the actions or surprises cruel and san∣guinary; the fortified places, and little wooden forts, exactly re∣presented, with various specimens of the art military of these distant <HI>Asiatics.</HI> I observed the <HI>Bactrian</HI> or two bunched camel much in use, carrying swivel guns on their backs, which were discharged at the fugitives climbing up the steeps of the moun∣tains. This work consists of sixteen very large prints, finely en∣graven. The copies in <HI>Europe</HI> are rare; ten thousand pounds were allowed for the execution.</P>
<P>THE use of artillery was not known among the <HI>Chinese</HI> till the arrival of the <HI>Europeans.</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">ARTILLERY.</NOTE> The first cannon they ever saw, were three, sent as a present to the emperor, by the <HI>Portuguese</HI> of <HI>Macao,</HI> in 1621. These were afterwards used against the <HI>Tartars,</HI> who came in swarms to the great wall, but terrified by the slaughter made among them by these novel machines of war, they never approached it more.</P>
<P>GUNPOWDER was invented in <HI>Europe</HI> by a monk;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">GUNPOWDER.</NOTE> the first cannon ever cast in <HI>China,</HI> were the work of a Jesuit, Father <HI>Adam Schaal,</HI> by order of the emperor; the next of the father <HI>Verbiest,</HI> the great ornament of the order; he first cast a hundred and thirty, and after that three hundred and twenty. They were tried in the presence of the emperor, who so greatly ap∣proved the services of <HI>Verhiest,</HI> that he loaded him with honors. The Jesuits, in return, fixed on a day for blessing his labors; dressed in his religious habit, he nine times prostrated himself, and beat his forehead against the ground. He had previously
<PB N="105" REF="119"/>fixed a crucifix on an altar before the train of artillery, which he baptized piece by piece, and gave to each the name of a male or female saint, taken from the calendar of his own church.</P>
<P>GUNPOWDER was of very early invention in <HI>China</HI> and in <HI>India,</HI> but till the time that I have just mentioned, it was never applied to any other uses than fire-works on festive occasions, in which the <HI>Chinese</HI> still excel all the rest of the world. I refer the reader to p. 362 of the preceding volume, for what I have said on the subject of the powder and artillery of the Orientalists.</P>
<P><HI>Voltaire</HI> asserts that the <HI>Chinese</HI> had a manufactory of glass above two thousand years ago.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">GLASS.</NOTE> <HI>Du Halde</HI> says that looking glasses are not among their articles of furniture. They have in∣deed at <HI>Yen-ching,</HI> in the province of <HI>Shang-tung,</HI> a manufactory, but so brittle is their <HI>Lew-li,</HI> or glass, as to break when exposed to too cold an air. I am farther confirmed by my worthy friend <HI>Thomas Fitzhugh,</HI> Esquire, (long resident in <HI>China)</HI> that the art of making glass in <HI>China</HI> was in a very imperfect state, as he in∣forms me that about sixty or seventy years they were supplied with that article from <HI>England,</HI> which would not have been the case had they excelled at home. The glass was carried over in pieces in the shape of bricks, from which trade it may be supposed the <HI>Chinese</HI> either did not then make it, or that they found it more expensive in the process than purchasing the ar∣ticles from foreigners
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The manufacture of glass, if a mere repetition of the fusion of broken pieces, or of cakes brought from <HI>Europe,</HI> deserves the name, is confined to <HI>Canton,</HI> and unknown in the rest of the empire. E. Embassy to <HI>China,</HI> Vol. ii. p. 288.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="120"/>THE works in japan or varnish,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">JAPANNING.</NOTE> are very considerable in this empire, but do not equal those made in <HI>Japan</HI> itself. The best is that of <HI>Tonking</HI> and <HI>Nanking;</HI> the varnish is produced from the <HI>Rhus-vernix,</HI> which the <HI>Chinese</HI> call <HI>Tsi.</HI> It is the same with that I have described at p. 72 of this volume. The process in collecting it is the same, and the workmen are affected with the same diseases in the operation; I therefore will not repeat what I have before mentioned.</P>
<P>THE very important article of silk shall next be spoken of.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">SILK.</NOTE> In my account of <HI>Spain</HI> will be given the history of the origin of this manufacture, and the various countries it passed through in its way from <HI>China,</HI> its native seat. The care of the silk-worm was of the most early date; it was begun by <HI>Si-ling,</HI> one of the queens of <HI>Whang-ti,</HI> third emperor from <HI>Fo-hi,</HI> at the period in which his subjects still clothed themselves in the undressed skins of wild beasts; how surprising was the change for the luxurious habit of silk. Succeeding empresses followed her example; they went attended by their fair suite to the orchard of mulberry trees, gathered the leaves of three trees, either with their own hands, or by the hands of the ladies under their inspection. A piece of the finest silk was woven and devoted to the ceremony of the sacrifice to the <HI>Shang-Ti,</HI> or the Supreme Being. More policy than religion is intermixed with this sacrifice; the wise <HI>Chinese</HI> knew that they could not inforce too strongly the cultivation of a tree which feeds the great staple of the empire.</P>
<P>The <HI>Chinese</HI> have two trees which contribute to this purpose;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">MULBERRY TREES.</NOTE> the one is the <HI>Sang</HI> or <HI>Te-sang,</HI> the <HI>Morus Alba</HI> or white mul∣berry tree, so well known in the south of <HI>Europe;</HI> this is culti∣vated
<PB N="107" REF="121"/>in plantations. The other kind is the <HI>Che,</HI> or <HI>Ye-sang,</HI> the wild mulberry, which grows on the hills in forests, has small roundish rough leaves scalloped on the edges, and termi∣nating in a point; the branches thorny; the fruit like pepper; in a few words a tree of a distinct species, if not genus, from the former. On these trees, the young of the silkworms which are hatched, are laid. The silk, produced from them, is said to be stronger and earlier than from those bred on the common mul∣berry. Paths are cut among the forests of the <HI>Che,</HI> the ground is cleared of weeds which may give shelter to serpents that devour the worms; and persons watch with guns to destroy the birds that make them their food; these trees are also cultivated in some places like the white mulberry.</P>
<P>I SHALL make mention of a species of silk totally different in its origin from the preceding; this is described by <HI>Du Halde</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. i. 354.</NOTE>,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">SILK OF PLINY.</NOTE> who says it is made by certain worms in the province of <HI>Shang∣tong.</HI> It is not fabricated by them into <HI>Cocons,</HI> but left adhering to small trees or shrubs in form of very long threads, which are gathered and woven into a coarse silk, called <HI>Kien chew,</HI> a very thick, lasting sort, which washes well, and is in much esteem with the <HI>Chinese.</HI></P>
<P>THIS account certainly vindicates the opinion held by the ancients that silk was an article combed from the leaves of cer∣tain trees. <HI>"Primi sunt hominum"</HI> says <HI>Pliny</HI> (speaking of the <HI>Scytharum Gen.</HI> lib. vi. c. xvii.)
<Q><HI>qui noscantur Seres, lanicio sylvarum nobiles, perfusam aqua depectentes frondium cani∣tiem:</HI></Q> <HI>Virgil</HI> delivers the same notion,
<Q>Velleraque ut foliis depectant tenuia <HI>Seres.</HI></Q>
<PB N="108" REF="122"/>The Romans believed it to be the same kind which was pro∣duced at <HI>Rome</HI> from the silk-thread which had found its way there in the time of <HI>Pliny,</HI> which makes him complain of the great trouble the <HI>Roman</HI> women had in winding and weaving their silk, whilst the <HI>Seres</HI> had no more to do than to gather it from the leaves of trees.
<Q><HI>Unde geminus foeminis nostris labor redordiendi fila rursusque texendi.</HI></Q> It was long before the ma∣nufacture of silks was established at <HI>Rome.</HI> The use was dis∣couraged by a law forbidding men to debase themselves by the wearing of silk, as fit only for women. The effeminate <HI>Helio∣gabalus</HI> is the first on record who wore a dress entirely of silk. The manufactory even in the ribband or haberdashery way did not reach our kingdom till about the year 1482. <HI>Spain</HI> had very long the start of us. Our monarchs were forced to be content with cloth stockings. <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. accidentally got a pair now and then from <HI>Spain.</HI> Sir <HI>Thomas Gresham</HI> presented a pair to <HI>Edward</HI> VI. which was much talked of. Mrs. <HI>Montague,</HI> silk∣woman to queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> presented her with a pair of black silk, after which, her highness would never wear any of cloth. Broad silks were not woven in <HI>England</HI> till the year 1620. The southern and western parts of <HI>Europe</HI> for centuries possessed that species of manufacture.</P>
<P>THE manufacture of cotton must have been of great antiquity.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">COTTON.</NOTE> <HI>Du Halde</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. i. p. 319.</NOTE> mentions the shrub, and the time of the sowing, which immediately follows the harvest, and in the same field. The produce is woven into calicoes, and into a cloth well known in <HI>England</HI> by the name of <HI>Nanquins,</HI> so called from the place
<PB N="109" REF="123"/>of manufacture. I imagine that the <HI>Chinese</HI> have not at present sufficient quantity of raw materials, as great quantities are said of late to have been imported from <HI>India.</HI></P>
<P>OF the woollen manufactures I can say very little.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">WOOLLENS.</NOTE> In the province of <HI>Shensi</HI> the sheep and goats are sheered thrice a year; and of the wool of the one and the hair of the other, mixed, is made a stuff much in request. The sheep are the great tailed kind.</P>
<P>THE Porcelain is of unknown antiquity.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">PORCELAIN.</NOTE> The Jesuit <HI>D'En∣trecolles</HI> who had a church in a town in the province of <HI>King-te∣ching,</HI> a first rate city which contained upwards of a million of people, could not trace the origin. That reverend father has been indefatigable in his enquiry; and has produced a most elaborate account of the materials and process.</P>
<P>THE first knowledge which the <HI>Europeans</HI> had of <HI>China</HI> was by the means of the <HI>Seres,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERES.</NOTE> inhabitants of the northern parts of the empire. These very distant people were among the nations whom the fame of <HI>Augustus</HI> had reached, and who complimented him with an embassy, which took four years journey to perform. They presented the emperor with pearls, pretious stones, and elephants. Silk is not mentioned; yet probably <HI>Virgil</HI> learned from them that it was the production of their country, as I re∣mark from the line of his at p. 107. <HI>Horace</HI> informs us how expert the <HI>Seres</HI> were in the use of the bow.</P>
<Q><L>Puer quis ex aula capillis</L>

<P><PB N="110" REF="124"/>
THE capital of these people is called by <HI>Ptolemy, Sera Metro∣polis,</HI> and placed by him in Lat. 38° 36′, which so nearly agrees with the latitude of <HI>King-chew</HI> in the province of <HI>Pe-che-li,</HI> as to leave no doubt of that having been the site. I have, at p. 8. of the first volume of this work, mentioned the <HI>Comedae,</HI> and the station of those who were bound for the commerce with the <HI>Seres.</HI> A branch of the <HI>Imaus</HI> runs from thence to the north∣east, and after some space to the east. Part of the country to the south-east of this chain is the <HI>Scythia intra Imaum;</HI> and the part to the north-east is the <HI>Serica Regio,</HI> or land of the <HI>Seres.</HI> Various towns or cities of little use to note are mentioned by <HI>Ptolemy.</HI> In his time the resting places of the merchants in their road to the <HI>Sera Metropolis.</HI> We know no more than that there was a commerce carried on with this country by caravans from the more western world; that it was interrupted by the <HI>Par∣thians,</HI> who had possessed themselves of most of the country from the <HI>Caspian</HI> sea to this branch of the <HI>Imaus;</HI> and by that means the intercourse was entirely cut off.</P>
<P>VERY long is the interval between that period and that in which we can find any travellers who had visited this distant country by land. In the year 1660 <HI>Nicolo Polo</HI> and his brother <HI>Maffio,</HI> illustrious <HI>Venetians,</HI> set out on their commercial journey. They took their departure from <HI>Constantinople</HI> for the splendid courts of the <HI>Tartarian</HI> princes, who lived in great magnificence, and gave the utmost encouragement to the <HI>European</HI> merchants and artists to come among them, and improve them in the arts. <HI>William Ruysbroek,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">RUBRUQUIS.</NOTE> better known by the name of Friar <HI>Rubruquis,</HI> made two journeys into great <HI>Tartary,</HI> and mentions <HI>Guillaume
<PB N="111" REF="125"/>L'Orfevre</HI> and other artists who were employed in the service of <HI>Mongu-khan.</HI> To this day many rich proofs of the skill of <HI>Eu∣ropean</HI> artists are discovered in tombs and other places. The <HI>Polos</HI> remained nine years abroad; and returning, <HI>Nicolo</HI> found his wife dead; he had left her pregnant; the child survived, and became the famous traveller so well known by the name of <HI>Marco Polo.</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">MARCO POLO.</NOTE> His father in 1271 accompanied his brother on another journey, and took <HI>Marco,</HI> then only eleven years of age, with him. They arrived at the court of <HI>Kublay-Khan,</HI> com∣monly called by the <HI>Chinese, Shi-Tsu,</HI> fifth emperor of <HI>Cathay</HI> or northern <HI>China,</HI> of the <HI>Mogol</HI> race, a monarch of abilities, and a great encourager of the arts. He took a particular liking to young <HI>Marco,</HI> who soon learned to read and write the four languages in use in the country; he was in the service of the emperor seventeen years. The royal residence during summer at that time was <HI>Kambalu</HI> or rather <HI>Hampalu, i. e.</HI> the seat of the <HI>Emperor,</HI> the same with the modern <HI>Pe-king;</HI> but the capital of the empire was the present <HI>Nanquin. Kublay-Khan</HI> made use of <HI>Marco</HI> on several important embassies and weighty affairs. The father and brother continued with the court; and in their commercial capacities contributed to its splendor by procuring jewels, and all the materials of luxury. <HI>Marco,</HI> his father, and uncle remained with the <HI>Khan</HI> a great number of years, and re∣turned safe to <HI>Venice</HI> in 1295, enriched by their profession, and in the highest esteem with their countrymen.</P>
<P><HI>Marco</HI> wrote his travels, which have been published in most languages; he was a diligent and faithful observer. I must refer to <HI>Bergeron,</HI> to <HI>Purchas,</HI> but particularly to <HI>John Reinhold
<PB N="112" REF="126"/>Forster,</HI> for the detail of his travels. He gives a most splendid account of the court of his master, and shews the state of the polite arts in <HI>China</HI> in those early days; mentions the use of the silk-worm, the knowlege of the making of paper from the <HI>Morus Papyrisera;</HI> the distillation of brandy from the milk of mares, and numbers of other curious circumstances beyond the limits of my plan. <HI>Marco</HI> was also attentive to the natural history of the country; mentions coals, which he calls black combustible stones; describes some sorts of falcons and cranes; the <HI>Argus</HI> pheasant, or pheasants with tails thirty inches long, and in particular speaks about the number of partridges and quails. He takes notice of the <HI>Musk</HI> animal, <HI>Hist. Quad.</HI> i. N<SUP>o</SUP> 65. The <HI>Thibet</HI> cows with long silky tails, N<SUP>o</SUP> 8. The <HI>Argali,</HI> N<SUP>o</SUP> 13, or wild sheep with enormous horns; and several other matters, both natural and oeconomical, which have since been confirmed by more modern travellers.</P>
<P>I SHALL now speak of the celebrated Sir <HI>John Mandeville.</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">SIR JOHN MANDEVILLE.</NOTE> Sir John was born at St. <HI>Albans,</HI> and became the greatest traveller of his or any other age, having been out thirty-four years, and in the character of pilgrim, knight-errant, and man of observa∣tion, visited the greatest part of <HI>Africa</HI> and <HI>Asia</HI> then known. It is probable that he penetrated as far as <HI>China.</HI> He left an account of his travels, which were shamefully falsified by the monks, who destroyed much of their credit, by mingling with them legendary tales, and stories out of <HI>Pliny;</HI> but still truth appears so frequently, that the authenticity of the ground work is by no means impaired. He was called <HI>Johannes de Mandevile</HI> aliter dictus ad <HI>Barbam,</HI> from his forked beard; he found a grave at
<PB N="113" REF="127"/><HI>Liege,</HI> in the convent of the Gulielmites in 1371. He is engraven on his tomb, armed, and treading on a lion. At his head, the hand of one blessing him; and these words in the <HI>French</HI> of the time,
<Q><HI>Vos ki paseis sor mi pour l'amour Deix proies por mi.</HI></Q> His knives, horse furniture, and spurs, were, in the time of <HI>Ortelius,</HI> preserved at <HI>Liege</HI> by the monks, and shewn to strangers.</P>
<P>THE intercourse which the <HI>Muscovites</HI> had by their caravans with this part of the eastern world, will be given in a future volume.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">RUSSIANS.</NOTE> I shall not therefore introduce it here, but proceed to the first dis∣covery of <HI>China</HI> by sea, by the <HI>Europeans,</HI> in the busy sixteenth century. In the year 1515 <HI>Alvarenga,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">PORTUGUESE.</NOTE> the <HI>Portuguese</HI> viceroy of the <HI>Indies,</HI> turned his thoughts towards a settlement in <HI>China;</HI> and bestowed on <HI>Ferdinand Pedro Andrada,</HI> an able officer, the conduct of the expedition. In <HI>June</HI> 1517 he set sail from <HI>Ma∣lacca,</HI> with three ships, and arrived at the island of <HI>Tamanlabua,</HI> four leagues from the main land of <HI>China.</HI> At that time the coast was infested with pirates; and fortunately <HI>Andrada</HI> fell in, says <HI>Osorio</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. ii. p. 244.</NOTE>, with the imperial fleet, who on sight of him (think∣ing him a pirate) prepared for battle; but how great was their surprize when they found that he gave no sign of hostile inten∣tion, but sailed peaceably with them till they anchored off the isle of <HI>Tama.</HI> I believe this to be the same which Mr. <HI>Nieuhoff</HI>
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Voy. p. 36.</NOTE> calls <HI>Heytamon,</HI> and possibly that on which <HI>Macao</HI> was built. The <HI>Chinese</HI> admiral there sent to enquire who these strange people were, and received such an answer as quite gained his confidence. <HI>Andrada</HI> then sailed with them for the port of
<PB N="114" REF="128"/><HI>Nanto,</HI> a fine city and harbor about sixty miles from <HI>Canton;</HI> there he met with the most hospitable reception, and by his prudent conduct quite conciliated the affection of the <HI>Chinese.</HI> He landed there the embassador <HI>(Thomas Perez)</HI> who was im∣mediately conducted to the imperial court. <HI>Andrada</HI> returned to the isle of <HI>Tama,</HI> informed himself of every thing that was necessary, and greatly enriched himself and companions by his commerce with the merchants, who flocked to him from diffe∣rent countries. He left <HI>China</HI> after impressing on the nation the highest opinion of the integrity of his countrymen.</P>
<P>ALL this was ruined by the ill conduct of <HI>Simon</HI> his brother, who soon after arrived there to form the settlement. After building a fort he thought himself secure, and began to offer insults and violence of every kind to the natives, who fell on the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> killed numbers, and obliged <HI>Simon</HI> to secure himself by flight.</P>
<P>THE emperor dismissed the embassador, who on his arrival at <HI>Canton,</HI> was flung into prison by the citizens, where he perished miserably.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Portuguese</HI> for a long time were the detestation of the <HI>Chinese;</HI> towards the close of the century they regained their affection by a piece of service they had an opportunity of doing to the empire by relieving it from the insult of the pirate <HI>Chang∣si-Lau,</HI> who had seized on the island of <HI>Macao,</HI> and was besieging <HI>Canton.</HI> The emperor presented the <HI>Portuguese</HI> with <HI>Macao,</HI> as a reward, who fortified it with two hundred pieces of cannon, at which the subtle <HI>Chinese</HI> took no sort of umbrage; for they had stationed their forces in such a manner, as to cut them off
<PB N="115" REF="129"/>(at will) from even their daily provision. The <HI>Portuguese</HI> still re∣tain possession of the city, and have a governor of their own; but a Mandarine resides here who is supreme over the whole island, so that they are in a very dependant state; and they be∣sides pay an annual tribute, on the original agreement of being permitted to erect fortifications. They enjoy their own laws and religion, and have a bishop of <HI>Macao,</HI> suffragan to the arch∣bishop of <HI>Goa.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>English</HI> came in late for their share of the <HI>Chinese</HI> trade.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">FIRST AT CHUSAN.</NOTE> when the <HI>Chinese</HI> granted to us <HI>Chusan,</HI> a small island not far from the coast of <HI>Tche-Tchiang,</HI> in Lat. 30° 40′. It had been totally depopulated by the <HI>Tartars,</HI> but began to be re-peopled when we settled there. The best account given of the place is by Mr. <HI>J. Cunningham,</HI> a very ingenious surgeon who attended our colony; he says
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ph. Trans. Abr. vol. v. p. 171.</NOTE> it abounded with provisions of all kind, and with cows, buffaloes, deer, goats, and wild hogs, and many kinds of esculent plants; and with the tea shrub on the tops of the hills. The <HI>Kiew-yeu, Croton Sebiferum</HI>
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Emb. to China, vol. ii. p. 430. E.</NOTE>, or tallow tree, is com∣mon
<PB N="116" REF="130"/>here, and many other parts of <HI>China;</HI> and grows as high as a tall cherry tree; the fruit opens like a chesnut, and contains kernels enveloped with a pulp, which has all the properties of tallow; excellent candles, void of any smell, are made of it when melted; it also supplies the lamps with oil; <HI>Du Halde</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. i. p. 319.</NOTE> gives us the process. He also describes a tree, called <HI>Pe-la-shu,</HI> which pro∣duces wax; a kind of little worm fastens on its leaves, where∣with being covered, in a short time they form combs of wax, much smaller than the honey combs; this wax is very hard and shining, and considerably dearer than bees-wax. When these worms are accustomed to the trees of any district, they never quit them, but on particular occasions; if once they re∣move from a place they never return, so that others must be pro∣cured in their stead, there being merchants who deal in them.</P>
<P>I cannot ascertain the <HI>Genus</HI> or species of this tree. There is a <HI>Myrica cerifera</HI> in <HI>North America</HI> that affords a very good wax, <HI>Catesby</HI> i. tab. 69; and another at the <HI>Cape of Good Hope, Journal Historique,</HI> &amp;c. p. 88. tab. opposite to the page; <HI>Spar∣man</HI> i. p. 346. <HI>Myrica Aethiopica Lin.</HI> Mr. <HI>Sparman</HI> says, that the berries are covered at a certain time of the year with a greenish, wax-like and tallowy substance, which he supposes to be the effect of insects: of this the natives make candles. I should think it the same with the species just described; but, that <HI>Du Halde</HI> says, the insects in the <HI>Chinese</HI> plants deposit their wax on the leaves. In the <HI>Aethiopica</HI> it is found on what <HI>Lin∣naeus</HI> calls cones.</P>
<P>MR. <HI>Cunningham</HI> also mentions the <HI>Syringa Arabica</HI> of <HI>Ge∣rard,</HI>
<PB N="117" REF="131"/>p. 1400; or the <HI>Nyctanthes sambac</HI> of <HI>Linnaeus.</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">NYCTANTHES SAMBAC.</NOTE> The <HI>Flos Mamorae</HI> of <HI>Rumph.</HI> v. tab. xxx. of general esteem among the Orientalists on account of the fine scent of the flowers.</P>
<P>OUR factory at <HI>Chusan</HI> was not of long duration; but was re∣moved to <HI>Canton,</HI> which, by a decree of the emperor, was di∣rected to be the only port allotted for the <HI>European</HI> commerce. We once had intercourse with the city of <HI>Ninpo,</HI> but that is also prohibited.</P>
<P>THE nature and extent of our present trade with <HI>China,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">PRESENT TRADE OF CHINA.</NOTE> both as to Imports and Exports is as follow. It is delivered in the form it was communicated to me by Mr. <HI>Fitzhugh.</HI></P>

THE <HI>Dutch</HI> made their first settlement for the benefit of the <HI>Chinese</HI> on the isle of <HI>Formosa;</HI>

The <HI>Dutch</HI> now were in possession of a flourishing trade, with the two great empires of <HI>China</HI> and <HI>Japan.</HI> It was lost to them in the year 1661 by the fault of the factions which reigned at <HI>Batavia,</HI> the seat of the <HI>Dutch</HI> govern∣ment in <HI>India. Iquon,</HI> a taylor, who lived in the <HI>Dutch</HI> town on the island of <HI>Formosa,</HI> a man of undaunted courage, had revolted from the <HI>Chinese</HI> empire, and became so powerful as to induce the Emperor to get him seized by persidy and poisoned;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">COXENGA.</NOTE> his son <HI>Cox∣enga,</HI> inherited all his abilities. At first he applied to the <HI>Dutch</HI> for succor; but being refused, turned his resentment against them. He prepared a vast fleet, and army; landed near the <HI>Dutch</HI> settlement, and notwithstanding every effort of the go∣vernor, <HI>Frederick Cojet</HI> (whose defence was gallant and obstinate) at length compelled him to surrender by capitulation. <HI>Cojet</HI> had been at first neglected by his countrymen, who when it was too late, sent a strong fleet from <HI>Batavia;</HI> it met with a severe re∣pulse, and was compelled to leave their colony to its fate. We shall hereafter meet the <HI>European</HI> nations at their common per∣missive settlement at <HI>Canton.</HI> I shall quit the subject I have been on, and change it to that of a particular topography of the coasts of the vast empire.</P>
<P>To speak generally;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOUNDARIES OF CHINA.</NOTE> the country may be said to be di∣vided
<PB N="123" REF="137"/>to the south from <HI>Thibet</HI> and <HI>Boutan,</HI> by chains of most exalted mountains, branches of the <HI>Imaus</HI> and <HI>Hemodus;</HI> they penetrate even into various parts of <HI>China:</HI> other mountains equally high, separate the empire from western <HI>Tartary.</HI> These vast Alpine chains are the defences of this mighty empire from invasions by land. The great wall (hereafter to be men∣tioned) secures the parts unprotected by nature. The coast is usually rude and rocky, and the interior often rises into craggy picturesque mountains, or is intersected by numerous rivers and canals. The seas are shallow, so that even from a naval attack the country has its protection.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING part of <HI>China</HI> is within the tropics, and the great remainder does not exceed Lat. 43 north, yet the cold is, during winter, intense. There is no country in which exists such a necessity for furs; their own empire, <HI>Tartary,</HI> and <HI>Siberia</HI> is almost exhausted for the supply; the <HI>English</HI> even furnish them with quantities from <HI>North America.</HI> Ice has been seen at <HI>Canton</HI> an inch in thickness. Between <HI>Nimpo</HI> and <HI>Peking</HI> the cold has been so severe in <HI>January</HI> and <HI>February</HI> that travellers have been forced to lie by, till the ice could be broken on the river <HI>Hoambo,</HI> the largest in <HI>China,</HI> before they could pass over. Mr. <HI>Kirwan</HI> says, that the greatest cold at <HI>Peking</HI> (in Lat. 39° 55′) is 5°, the greatest heat 98; yet on <HI>July</HI> 25th, 1773, the thermometer rose to 108 and 110. The extremest cold is produced by a north-east or north-west wind; the last blows over the vast tract of <HI>Tartary</HI> and <HI>Siberia.</HI> In <HI>Peking,</HI> during winter, the animals and fowls of all kinds are exposed to sale in the markets, frozen, and so preserved from putrefaction for weeks together.</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="138"/>THE interior of <HI>China</HI> maintains a most singular character; it is varied with chains of mountains winding along its surface, yet so as to leave vallies that enabled one of the emperors to open a communication by water, partly by means of rivers and partly by navigable canals, from <HI>Peking</HI> to <HI>Canton,</HI> a distance of 1500 miles: little interruption occurs in this vast space, except the lofty mountains which separate the provinces of <HI>Kiang-see</HI> and <HI>Quan-Tung.</HI> We shall speak farther of this, and the other canals, in their proper places.</P>
<P>I SHALL now enter on the topographical account,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">ISLAND OF HAI∣NAN.</NOTE> commencing at its southern extremity. The island of <HI>Hainan, i. e.</HI> the south of the sea, expresses its situation. It belongs to the province of <HI>Quang-tung</HI> (which, opposite to <HI>Hai-nan,</HI> juts far south in a peninsulated form) and is distant above twelve miles from the shore; is a hundred and sixty leagues in circumference, and produces every thing that can conduce to the wants and conve∣niences of life; the climate alone is bad, by reason of the quality of the water.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">GOLD.</NOTE> The island abounds with gold; but as it has been but half conquered, that valuable metal is in the power of the natives, a brave, independent people, who live in the middle parts, amidst arduous mountains; the rest of the country being a plain. The inhabitants had long a traffic with the <HI>Chinese;</HI> one was deputed to examine the goods offered; and on the other part a <HI>Chinese</HI> merchant went to see those of the mountaineers: the utmost honor was observed on both sides. The <HI>Chinese,</HI> espe∣cially the governor, made immense profit of the gold. This the great <HI>Kang-hi</HI> discovered, and put a final stop to a commerce which till then had been allowed by law. The <HI>Lapis Armenus,</HI> which produces blue so much in request for coloring the porce∣lane,
<PB N="125" REF="139"/>is also found here, and much of it sent to <HI>Canton</HI> for that purpose. The fisheries are very lucrative, twenty or thirty thou∣sand jonks, of no inconsiderable size, come annually from <HI>Canton</HI> to take in cargoes of the dried or salted fish. Our company's ships now and then put in here, and may be secure during the mon∣soons.</P>
<P>THE continent, after attaining the bottom of the peninsula, trends towards the north-east, and is all the way skirted with isles. Those best known to mariners are the two <HI>Sanciams,</HI> the <HI>False,</HI> and that called <HI>Saint John</HI>'s, beneath which is good an∣chorage. The great <HI>Ladrone</HI> and the <HI>Asses Ears</HI> are noted land marks. The entrance of the vast bay of <HI>Canton</HI> opens to the east of <HI>Sanciam;</HI> the breadth there is about two and twenty leagues, and the depth nearly the same; but filled with islands divided by most narrow and intricate channels; possibly these might be the <HI>gates</HI> of <HI>China</HI> mentioned by the two <HI>Maho∣metan</HI> travellers of the ninth century, as <HI>Canton</HI> was their <HI>Canfu,</HI> even at that time a most flourishing city. It was also the <HI>Ca∣nectum</HI> of the <HI>Nubian</HI> geographer
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Page 35.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><HI>Sanciam</HI> is famed for having been the place of interment of <HI>Saint Francis de Xavier,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">ISLE OF SAN∣CIAM.</NOTE> and for his tomb, which still is to be seen. Another isle is that of <HI>Hoan-pou,</HI> where the <HI>Dutch</HI> had built a fort in order to command the navigation of the <HI>Tigris,</HI> or river of <HI>Canton.</HI> Their design was discovered, and they were all massacred.</P>
<P>THE most important city is that of <HI>Macao,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">MACAO.</NOTE> seated on a little peninsula, and which was, during a certain period, celebrated
<PB N="126" REF="140"/>for its wealth and commerce; it is now quite declined from its former splendor, but is well known to the <HI>Europeans,</HI> as the place where their ships commonly anchor in their way inward, and from being the residence of all the <HI>European</HI> factories, who are obliged by the <HI>Chinese</HI> to quit <HI>Canton</HI> as soon as the ships have left the river.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">TYPA.</NOTE> About six miles lower is the <HI>Typa,</HI> a harbor for careening of ships. Here Commodore <HI>Anson</HI> heaved down the <HI>Centurion</HI> in <HI>January</HI> 1743, previous to the capture of the <HI>Manilla</HI> ship on <HI>June</HI> 20th, old stile, which established the great fortunes of that lucky house.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Hu-men,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOCCA TIGRIS.</NOTE> or <HI>Tigers-gate,</HI> or the <HI>Bocca-tigris</HI> of the <HI>Portu∣guese,</HI> is the narrow pass into that river, which is not a musket∣shot over, and defended by two miserable batteries. Mr. <HI>Anson</HI> passed them in his way to the <HI>Canton</HI> river. The poor pilot, who reluctantly carried him through, and the mandarine who com∣manded the forts, were most severely punished for what they could not possibly help; the commodore having threatened to hang the pilot in case of non-compliance. The poor mandarine knew his own weakness. The real mouth of the river is some miles below the <HI>Bocca,</HI> and has on one side the <HI>Lion</HI>'s tower, or pagoda. The river takes from thence a grand curvature towards the west. The anchoring place for the <HI>European</HI> ships is under the isle of <HI>Wampoo,</HI> a few miles to the east of <HI>Canton.</HI> The approach into the bay, and the amazing view along the river, is so graphically described by my fa∣vorite M. <HI>Le Poivre,</HI> that I cannot resist using the words of that enchanting author.
<Q>On the appearance of land (says he) I perceived along the horizon a forest of masts, and soon
<PB N="127" REF="141"/>after an innumerable multitude of boats, which covered the surface of the water: these were thousands of fishermen, whose industry drew from the deeps subsistence for numbers. The land now began to rise to my view. I advanced to the mouth of the river, still amidst crowds of fishers, throwing out their lines on every side. I entered the river of <HI>Kanton;</HI> it is people like the land; its banks lined with ships at an∣chor; a prodigious number of small craft are continually gliding along in every direction, some with sails, others with oars, vanishing often suddenly from the sight, as they enter the numberless canals, dug with amazing labour across ex∣tensive plains, which they water and fertilize. Immense fields, covered with all the glory of the harvest, with stately villages rising to the eye on every side, adorn the remoter view, whilst mountains, covered with verdure, cut into terraces, and shaped into amphitheatres, form the back ground of this noble land∣scape.</Q></P>
<P>THE <HI>Chinese</HI> divide their cities into first rate, second, and third.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">CANTON.</NOTE> The first may be known by the addition of <HI>foo,</HI> the second by that of <HI>tchoo,</HI> the third by that of <HI>hyen. Quang-tchoo-foo,</HI> or <HI>Canton,</HI> is chief among the first, as it is supposed to contain a mil∣lion of inhabitants. <HI>Fachan,</HI> a village a few miles higher, has the same number. This in some measure inclines us to think that <HI>Voltaire</HI>'s calculation is not very far out of the way.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">VERY POPULOUS.</NOTE> The land, and the very water is inhabited. Millions live in the <HI>Sam∣panes,</HI> or vessels, placed on each side of the great rivers. Those of <HI>Canton</HI> alone may contain two hundred and twenty∣five thousand inmates. Thousands and thousands dwell on the
<PB N="128" REF="142"/>exalted rocks; some are excavated into mansions, and every ledge has on its its elegant cottage; swarms of people inhabit the edges of precipices, as the myriads of birds do the great promon∣tories of <HI>Britain.</HI> Paths are cut through the rocks to render them accessible, and over some are conducted even public roads. I have seen several of these populated rocks most accurately represented in rice, with all the oeconomy of their inhabitants expressed.</P>
<P>THE city is divided into three; the <HI>Tartarian,</HI> the <HI>Chinese,</HI> and a third beyond the first, which is represented on the plan as a void space. The streets are narrow, but well paved; and cross each other at right angles. The whole is surrounded with a wall; and each city separated from the other by another wall. The gates of <HI>Canton</HI> are shut in the evening, as are the barriers at the end of every street, so that the greatest cities are as quiet as a private family.</P>
<P>TRIUMPHAL arches are very frequent in most of the cities;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">TRIUMPHAL ARCHES.</NOTE> the ancient are the most elegant, adorned with beautiful figures of men, birds, and flowers in alt-relief, quite standing from the stone, and connected only by cordons left for the purpose. These monuments are probably honorary memorials of the great ac∣tions of individuals.</P>
<P>IN front, on each side of the city, and on the opposite shore of the river,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">EUROPEAN FACTORIES</NOTE> are large suburbs. The factories of the <HI>Eu∣ropean</HI> merchants consist of a long row of houses, ranged on the river side, and a space of land behind, about two hundred yards broad; each has a warehouse for its goods. The mer∣cantile nations are the <HI>English, French, Imperialists, Dutch, Swedes</HI> and <HI>Danes.</HI> Each factory has the flag of its country
<PB N="129" REF="143"/>erected before it on a tall pole. This is the only port in the whole empire allowed to the <HI>Europeans.</HI> Their ships may take in wood and water where they please, but are every where else strictly forbid to trade; even here they are a sort of prisoners, they are not to go beyond their bounds; they may indeed enter the suburbs, but are sure to meet with every species of abuse from the mob. They are allowed to reside only during the time the ships remain at <HI>Wampu;</HI> for as soon as they sail for <HI>Europe</HI> every factory is obliged to retire to <HI>Macao</HI> till the season of their return.</P>
<P>THE proper name of the river of <HI>Canton</HI> is <HI>Ta-Ho,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">RIVER OF CANTON.</NOTE> or the great river. The stream is rapid, but affected by the tide which rises four or five feet opposite to the city; it is navigable for numbers of miles into the interior parts of the country for large vessels, from the sea even to the city of <HI>Quang-si;</HI> and again its advantages are spread far and wide by the infinity of canals. Not only this, and other cities, but the canals themselves, for miles together, have their quays made of cut stone of stu∣pendous size, forming the most magnificent sight which art, ap∣plied to commercial purposes, can exhibit.</P>
<P>THE river of <HI>Canton</HI> is guarded by various fortifications. The square castle on the island, engraven by Mr. <HI>Nieuhoff,</HI> is a speci∣men of that kind of defence.</P>
<P>THE multitudes of ducks which animate the river about <HI>Canton</HI> is amazing;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">TAME DUCKS.</NOTE> "they are hatched," says Mr. <HI>Latham</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ornith. Vol. iii. 492.</NOTE>
<Q>by artificial heat; the eggs being laid in boxes of sand, are placed on a brick hearth, to which is given a proper heat during the
<PB N="130" REF="144"/>required time for hatching. The ducklings are fed with little craw-fishes and crabs, boiled and cut small, and afterwards mixed with boiled rice, and in about a fortnight shift for themselves, when the <HI>Chinese</HI> provide them an old step-mother, who leads them where they are to find provender for them∣selves, being first put on board a <HI>Sampane,</HI> or boat, which is destined for their habitation, and from which the whole flock, often to the amount of three or four hundred, go out to feed, and return at command. This method is used nine months out of the twelve (for in the colder months it does not suc∣ceed) and is so far from a novelty, that it may be every where seen; but more especially about the time of cutting the rice and gleaning the crop, when the masters of the duck <HI>Sampanes</HI> row up and down the river, according to the oppor∣tunity of procuring food, which is found in plenty at the tide of ebb on the rice plantations, as they are overflowed at high water. It is curious to see how the ducks obey their master; for some thousands, belonging to different boats, will feed at large on the same spot, and on a signal given will follow their leader to their respective <HI>Sampanes,</HI> without a stranger being found among them. This is still more extraordinary if we consider the number of inhabited <HI>Sampanes</HI> on the <HI>Tigris,</HI> supposed to be no less than forty thousand, which are moored in rows close to each other, with a narrow passage at intervals for boats to pass up and down the river. The <HI>Tigris</HI> at <HI>Canton</HI> is somewhat wider than the <HI>Thames</HI> at <HI>London,</HI> and the whole river is there covered in this manner for the extent of at least a mile.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="145"/>THE manner of taking the wild ducks in this country is singular.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">WILD DUCKS, HOW TAKEN.</NOTE> The performers put their heads into the shells of large gourds, with holes made in them to see and breathe through; then going naked into the water, they walk or swim so low, that nothing appears but the gourds. The ducks, being ac∣customed to see gourds floating on the surface, and to play about them, approach without fear; when the duck-hunter, taking them by the feet, pulls them under water to prevent their making a noise, wrings their necks, and fastens them to his girdle, pur∣suing his exercise till he has procured a great number.</P>
<P>I MAY mention here that most elegant of ducks,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHINESE TEAL.</NOTE> the <HI>Chinese Teal</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Latham, Ornith. Vol. iii. 548.</NOTE>; but words are almost wanting to express the beauty of the coloring, and the specific oddity of the fine feathers of the wings, erecting themselves in a curved manner when the wings are closed. Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI>'s representation
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Tab. 102.</NOTE> may serve to give the idea. These are a scarce species, and kept for sale at <HI>Canton,</HI> and sold at the rate of six or even ten dollars the pair.</P>
<P>No country abounds with fishes equal to <HI>China,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">FISHES.</NOTE> yet we have been very unfortunate by the inattention paid to that branch of its natural history. <HI>Osbeck</HI> and <HI>Sparman,</HI> both boasted disciples of <HI>Linnaeus,</HI> have given us but a very meagre catalogue. From these, and a few other sources, I shall give all that I can collect; let me observe that the most numerous <HI>genera</HI> of fresh water are the carp and the perch. <HI>Du Halde</HI> mentions some curious species of fishes, but his descriptions want the perspicuity of a naturalist, so are unintelligible.</P>
<P><HI>Du Halde</HI> ii. p. 316. gives us two very curious methods of
<PB N="132" REF="146"/>fishing,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">COVORANTS TRAINED FOR FISHING.</NOTE> one is by means of a species of Corvorant trained for the purpose. By the figure given by Mr. <HI>Nieuhoff,</HI> p. 118. it seems the very same to our common kind
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This Corvorant proves to be a distinct species, distinguished by the name of <HI>Pelicanus Si∣nensis,</HI> and is figured in the 37th plate of Sir G. Staunton's Account of the Embassy to <HI>China;</HI> the mode of conveying these birds from place to place is delineated in Vol. ii. p. 389. of that entertaining and interesting work. E.</NOTE>. The <HI>Chinese</HI> call it <HI>Louwa.</HI> In Mr. <HI>Willughby</HI>'s ornithology p. 329, we find that this species of fisheries was in old times frequently practised in <HI>England.</HI> Mr. <HI>Latham,</HI> vi. 346. informs us that a kind of diver is used also for the same purpose. "In the morning" (says <HI>Du Halde,</HI> i. 316.)
<Q>when the sun rises one may see on the rivers a considerable number of boats, and several of these birds sitting at the head of them. Then the fishermen turning their boats about, at the signal given by striking the water with an oar, the cormorants fly into the river, one here, another there, and diving to the bottom, seize the fish they light on by the middle; then rising up again, they carry it to the bark, where the fisherman receiving it, takes the bird, and holding its head downwards, passes his hand along the neck to make it disgorge the small fish that it had swallowed, but is hindred from going into the gullet by a ring put on the lower part of the neck; which after the fishing is quite over, they take off and give them something to eat. When the fish happens to be too large for one bird, they mutually assist each other; one takes the tail, another the head, and bring it to the boat to their master.</Q></P>
<P>THE other way of taking fish is very simple, and gives but little trouble; for this purpose they make use of long narrow
<PB N="133" REF="147"/>boats, nailing on each side from one end to the other, a plank two feet broad. This plank is japanned with white shining varnish, and slants gently till it almost touches the top of the water; in the night time, when it is used, they turn it towards the moon, that the reflection may increase its splendor, so that the fish which are sporting, easily mistaking the color of the japanned plank for that of the water, leap often on that side, and fall either on the plank or into the boat.</P>
<P>IN respect to quadrupeds,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">QUADRUPEDS.</NOTE> this empire retains many of those of <HI>India,</HI> but loses also several towards the northern and western parts: others appear suited to the climate; these are pointed out in the <HI>Faunula,</HI> which I reserve as a sort of appendix, unwilling to interrupt the narrative part of this work.</P>
<P>AT <HI>Canton</HI> begins the celebrated passage by water from hence to <HI>Peking,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">WATER PAS∣SAGE TO PEKING.</NOTE> and the extremity of the great empire of <HI>China;</HI> an extent, says <HI>Du Halde</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. ii. 326.</NOTE>, of six hundred leagues, or about eigh∣teen hundred <HI>English</HI> miles. The emperor <HI>Shi-tsu</HI> finding the defect of tribute he annually sustained, or the vast loss of his subjects in the articles of commerce which perished at sea in the conveyance from the maritime parts of his dominions, deter∣mined on creating an internal navigation.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">IMPERIAL CA∣NAL.</NOTE> He began the work in 1289; it is probable that he did not complete so stupendous an undertaking; and it is imagined it was not finished till the time of <HI>Yong-Jo,</HI> who began his reign about thirty-five years after. We may well admit this, as the length of the imperial canal is nine hundred miles, the depth a fathom and a half, and it conveys annually near ten thousand large barks belonging to
<PB N="134" REF="148"/>the Emperor, besides others innumerable, the property of mer∣chants, or of private people, who hire them to travellers. They are all richly ornamented, especially the imperial, which carry on them the dragon of five claws, the arms of the empire. The traveller, if he takes the route of <HI>Quang-si</HI> and <HI>Hu-quang,</HI> is under no necessity of ever quitting his bark from <HI>Canton</HI> to <HI>Pe∣king;</HI> he meets with rivers and lakes till he falls in again with the <HI>Yu-Ho,</HI> or <HI>Royal Canal,</HI> as it is named by way of pre-emi∣nence. On that canal the voyager is only obliged to quit his vessel once in nine hundred miles; the mountain <HI>Meylin</HI> inter∣venes, and makes it necessary for him to take a day's journey before he can again benefit of the royal work. The shipping on the canal and rivers are often so numerous as to fill the channel for a mile or two, and quite obstruct for a time their progress.</P>
<P>GREAT fairs are also kept on the rivers.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">GREAT FAIR ON THE WATER.</NOTE> "One season," says <HI>Hamilton,</HI>
<Q>at one place, and in other seasons at other places; and though there may be 10,000 vessels assembled at a fair, yet there is as good order and decorum kept as in a well∣governed city. All ships and boats who have the same species of goods are moored together, along a certain place on the river side allotted for them by proper magistrates, and at night watches are sent to prevent thieving and disorder, and of∣fenders are severely punished without respect of persons.</Q></P>
<P><HI>John Nieuhoff,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">J. NIEUHOFF.</NOTE> the celebrated traveller of the last century, is the only one
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sir George Staunton's Account of the spirited and well-conducted Embassy to <HI>China</HI> was not published at the time this work was composed. E.</NOTE> who gives an account of the entire inland voyage from the south to almost the very north of the mighty empire.
<PB N="135" REF="149"/>That able writer was born on <HI>July</HI> 22d, 1618, at <HI>Uffen,</HI> in the earldom of <HI>Bentham,</HI> of a respectable family; his person was elegant, his understanding good, his temper and conversation amiable; he was fond of the fine arts, poetry, music, and draw∣ing; and master of several languages. In the year 1646 he en∣tered into the <HI>Dutch West India</HI> service, and made his first voyage to the <HI>Brazils,</HI> where he resided nine years. He has left us an admirable description of the country, and of the many great events of that period which happened between his countrymen and the <HI>Portuguese.</HI></P>
<P>HIS next voyage was to the <HI>East Indies,</HI> in the year 1653. He visited the coast of <HI>Malabar,</HI> the peninsula of <HI>Malacca,</HI> and many of the islands, even to the <HI>Moluccas.</HI> His accounts are the most satis∣factory of any extant; his attention to several branches of natural history was very considerable; and he has given various plates of the fishes of the <HI>Indies,</HI> done with much accuracy, considering the infant state of the science. On this voyage he was eight years ab∣sent from home. His last voyage (designed also for the <HI>East Indies)</HI> was begun on <HI>January</HI> 1st, 1672. He landed at <HI>Madagascar,</HI> in order to trade with the natives, and, as is supposed, was, with his people, massacred by the inhabitants in the month of <HI>Sep∣tember</HI> of the same year, for he never more was heard of. Di∣ligent enquiry was made after him by the surviving part of the crew left on board his ship, and afterwards a yatch was dis∣patched from the <HI>Cape of Good Hope</HI> to repeat the search, which proved equally fruitless.</P>
<P>HIS brother, <HI>Henry Nieuhoff,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">H. NIEUHOFF.</NOTE> collected together all the papers he left behind, and published them, to the great honor of his
<PB N="136" REF="150"/>memory. They were written and printed originally in <HI>Dutch. Churchill</HI> has given us his voyage to the <HI>Brazils</HI> and to the <HI>East Indies</HI> in the second volume of his collection. The learned <HI>Hor∣nius</HI> has translated into <HI>Latin</HI> the famous journey from <HI>Canton</HI> to <HI>Peking.</HI> This is so curious and novel, that I shall attend the able traveller in his route, and briefly notice the most remark∣able things.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">HIS TRAVELS TO PEKING.</NOTE> An embassy was determined on by the <HI>Dutch</HI> to the coast of <HI>Peking,</HI> to the great emperor <HI>Kang-hi. Nieuhoff</HI> was for∣tunately appointed secretary. His account is a first-rate per∣formance; and the more pleasing, as it is attended with views of the country, cities, and buildings, engraven from drawings done by his skilful pencil.</P>
<P>THE embassadors had every possible respect paid to them; they embarked at <HI>Canton,</HI> on board a magnificent jonk, on <HI>March</HI> 17th, 1656, amidst the acclamations of the people, and a general discharge of the artillery. The <HI>Chinese</HI> sent <HI>avant-cou∣riers</HI> from place to place to make provisions for their reception, even till their arrival at <HI>Peking.</HI></P>
<P>THEY began with ascending the river <HI>Pei-kyang-ho,</HI> all their route was marked with beautiful scenery, and various towns and cities, most of them surrounded with embattled walls, and strengthened by square towers. Many of the landscapes are most picturesque. We are struck with the river flowing by the vast mountain <HI>Sang-won-hab,</HI> over-hanging on both sides; and on one a great frequented road,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">STRANGE ROAD.</NOTE> cut out of the solid rock, impending over the water. At the foot is a pagoda, the nightly haunt (say the natives) of daemons.</P>
<P>FARTHER on,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">CITY XAOCHEW.</NOTE> not remote from the city <HI>Xaochew</HI> or <HI>Tchau-tchoo∣foo,</HI>
<PB N="137" REF="151"/>a vast mountain seems to open its sides to make room for the famed pagoda <HI>Konjan-Sjam,</HI> filled with horrid idols, to whom al∣most constant sacrifices are offered by the fanatical visitants.</P>
<P>A LITTLE farther is the great castle <HI>Mongley,</HI> of a quadrangu∣lar form, with a square tower at each corner; equal in size within to a town; seated on a losty eminence, and accessible by a nu∣merous flight of steps cut out of the live rock.</P>
<P>THE city <HI>Xaochew</HI> next appears, near the conflux of two rapid rivers, infamous for frequent wrecks. A pagoda is erected on the banks, famed for its idol, to which mariners send up their prayers for a safe passage, as the <HI>Romans</HI> did of old, and as the Christians of many parts of <HI>Europe</HI> do to their Saint <HI>Elmo</HI> to this very day.</P>
<P>THE rocks called the <HI>Five horses heads,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">FIVE HORSES HEADS.</NOTE> and the still more cu∣rious rocks named <HI>Suytjeen,</HI> or the <HI>five horrible devils,</HI> near to the ferry <HI>Suytjeen,</HI> as much dreaded as <HI>Scylla</HI> and <HI>Charybdis</HI> for the frequent shipwrecks near them. They are of a columnar form, and appear as if placed in order by human art.</P>
<P><HI>Nanhang</HI> or <HI>Nan-sheun-foo,</HI> in Lat. 25° 11′ 58″,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">CITY NANHANG.</NOTE> is the last in the province of <HI>Quang-tung,</HI> and a considerable trading city; to the north of it is a famous road over the mountain <HI>Meylin,</HI> cut through the rock, three miles in length, with precipices on both sides, but of a secure wideness. This singular road being a great communication from north to south, is perpetually crowded as much as the streets of the most populous cities; on the sum∣mit is built a temple in honor of the mandarine who made this useful way at his own expence.</P>
<P>AFTER travelling some days on horseback,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">NANGAN.</NOTE> Mr. <HI>Nieuhoff</HI> reached the great city <HI>Nangan,</HI> in the province of <HI>Kyang-see,</HI> seated on
<PB N="138" REF="152"/>the river <HI>Kanhyang,</HI> in Lat. 28° 37′ 12″. This river runs through the middle of the province, and divides it into two equal parts. The <HI>Chinese</HI> call it <HI>Kan-kiang,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">THE KYANG RIVER.</NOTE> or son of the sea, and added that "the sea is without shore, and the <HI>Kyang</HI> without bottom;" this fiction arises from the fishermen never using any sounding lines above sixty fathoms long, but even that depth is a vast one for a river. By means of the numerous canals that branch from it, the city has vast commerce, and was once celebrated for its porcelain of a snowy whiteness. The province is rich in mines of gold, silver, iron, lead, and tin. The silks are very beautiful; and the rice, and wine made from it, is in high esteem in all parts of the empire.</P>
<P>THE lakes of this province are in the season covered with the beautiful blossoms of the <HI>Nymphaea Lotus</HI> and <HI>Nelumbo;</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">NYMPHAEA NELUMBO.</NOTE> no flowers are in such request with the <HI>Chinese</HI> as these. The great men have them transplanted into their little ponds, filled for the purpose with mud and water, in their courts. The physicians esteem the fruit as highly restorative after long sickness; and the root of the <HI>Nelumbo</HI> is a common food, either eaten raw or made into meal; so that these plants are of the first use in this empire.</P>
<P><HI>Vannunga,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">VANNUNGA.</NOTE> on the river <HI>Kan,</HI> was a city of great size and splendor, now a heap of ruins from an inroad of the <HI>Tartars;</HI> a melancholy sight to the numerous passengers who sail under its walls.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">PEKKINSA.</NOTE> <HI>Pekkinsa</HI> is the next city, a most flourishing place, which supplies the mariners with all kind of necessaries for their vessels.</P>
<P>NOT far from thence are various specimens of several lofty rocky hills,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">PIERCED HILLS.</NOTE> cut or pierced through by human art, into grotesque
<PB N="139" REF="153"/>forms merely to please the eye. Those engraven by Mr. <HI>Nieuhoff</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 73.</NOTE> are pierced through in various places, others have great flights of steps, cut out of the live rock, either to the summit or half way up, round which a walk is conducted, guarded by rails, and forming a gallery beneath the impending remainder of the mountain.</P>
<P><HI>Nang-tchang-foo</HI> is a city seated in Lat. 29° 30′,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">NAN-TCHANG∣FOO.</NOTE> near the lake <HI>Po-yang,</HI> which is about four leagues broad and thirty in length,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">LAKE PO-YANG.</NOTE> abounding with excellent fish, among which are many <HI>European,</HI> such as sturgeon, salmon, carp, chubs, trout, shads, and lam∣pries.</P>
<P>ABOUT thirty miles farther to the north of <HI>Nan-tchang,</HI> the waters of the lake unite with those of the great river <HI>Kyang,</HI> which is continued from thence to the sea.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">HOO-TCHOO.</NOTE> The city <HI>Hoo-tchoo</HI> stands on the eastern bank of the junction. A few miles up the river to the west, is the city <HI>Kyew Kiang,</HI> the rendezvous of the barks of many parts of the empire. The river runs gently from hence to the sea with a course almost imperceptible; but is at full and new moon affected by the tide.</P>
<P>IN the <HI>Kyang</HI> near that city, where the river is a league broad,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">THE FISH WHANG-YU.</NOTE> is found the <HI>Whang-yu</HI> or yellow fish, that often weighs eight hun∣dred pounds; it is remarkably firm, and most excellent eating; these fish are taken in certain seasons when they come out of the lake <HI>Poyang</HI> into the river. We cannot ascertain the species. <HI>Du Halde</HI>
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Vol. i. p. 315.</NOTE> speaks of another he calls the <HI>Cho-kyaryw</HI> or armour fish,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">ARMOUR FISH.</NOTE> being covered with strong scales, placed like tiles in the roof of a house. I suspect it to be the <HI>esox osseus</HI> of <HI>Linnoeus,</HI> or the
<PB N="140" REF="154"/><HI>acus maxima squammosa</HI> of <HI>Willughby, Hist. pisc.</HI> app. 22. tab. p. viii. This grows to forty pounds weight, and is in high esteem.</P>
<P>ABOUT fifty miles from the eastern side of the <HI>Poyang</HI> lake,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">KING-TE∣CHING.</NOTE> in Lat. 29° 15′, stands <HI>King-te-ching,</HI> on a plain surrounded with mountains, and having a navigable communication with the lake, by means of a river that passes by the city <HI>Yau-chew,</HI> and is crowded with vessels which are continually passing or re-passing, either with the materials for the famous porcelain ware, or with the porcelain itself, which is manufactured in no other place in the empire than at <HI>King-te-ching.</HI></P>
<P>IN the Itinerary of Mr. <HI>Nieuhoff,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">TONG-LYU. UFUN.</NOTE> <HI>Tong-lyu, Ufun, Anhing,</HI> and <HI>Teytong,</HI> appear most delightfully seated on the river. <HI>Tong-lyu</HI> bears numerous marks of the ravages of the <HI>Tartars;</HI> at <HI>Ufun</HI> is a manufacture of arms famous throughout all the empire.</P>
<P>THE great city of <HI>Nanking</HI> or <HI>Nanquin,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">NANQUIN.</NOTE> in Lat. 32° 4′ 30″, is seated on an extensive plain, near a league from the river, but united to it by several canals, capable of bringing up the im∣perial barks, which are as large as middle sized ships. This city was once the capital of <HI>China,</HI> till it was removed to <HI>Peking.</HI> It was the <HI>Chambdan</HI> of the <HI>Nubian</HI> geographer, on a river of the same name, which he says
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 69.</NOTE> was the largest in <HI>China.</HI> The <HI>Tartars</HI> made themselves masters of this city in 1127, and before they deserted it, burnt the magnificent imperial palace, demo∣lished the famous observatory, and violated and destroyed the se∣pulchres of the emperors and other distinguished personages. The city is reported to be ninety miles in circumference; later
<PB N="141" REF="155"/>surveys have made it only eighteen, but it certainly had been of far greater extent; much is now a waste, and retains all the marks of the <HI>Tartarian</HI> fury, but enough is inhabited to make it a most populous and flourishing city. Of the parts which escaped the rage of the <HI>Tartarian</HI> ravages, is the <HI>Porcelain tower,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">PORCELAIN TOWER.</NOTE> a pagoda of nine stages, of most exquisite workmanship, and lined with beautiful tiles of <HI>Porcelain,</HI> from which it derives its name. It is far the most beautiful in <HI>China.</HI> Mr. <HI>Nieuhoff</HI> gives a fine view of this curious structure, as he does of one of the modern streets, the signs, and manner of building; the walls of the city, some of the gates, and idol temples, evince its former grandeur; it is besides the seat of the literati, and consequently abounds with fine li∣braries, and is eminent for its booksellers shops, paper, ink, and all that can feed the <HI>Cacoethes scribendi.</HI> It is not without other manufactures; its fattins are in high request, as are the woollen cloths fabricated here.</P>
<P><HI>Nanquin</HI> is garrisoned partly by <HI>Chinese,</HI> partly by <HI>Tartars;</HI> the last commanded by one of their country; they possess one part of the city, and are separated from the other inhabitants by a single wall.</P>
<P>ABOUT the year 1660, the famous <HI>Corsair Coxinga</HI> came up the river with three thousand sail of ships, and laid siege to the place. It happened that on his birth day, his army past the day with carousals, and all sorts of festivity. The garrison, guessing that they should find the enemy buried in sleep, sallied out, surprised the camp, slew multitudes, and forced the rest to find security in their ships. <HI>Coxinga</HI> afterwards fought and defeated the <HI>Tar∣tarian</HI> fleet, and by his cruelty in cutting off the noses of four thousand prisoners, sullied his victory.</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="156"/>THE passage over the <HI>Kyang</HI> from <HI>Nanquin,</HI> was in the time of <HI>Nieuhoff</HI> on a bridge composed of fourteen pontoons. The pretty town of <HI>Jejenjeen</HI> is on the opposite side.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">YANG-CHOO.</NOTE> He entered soon after on the imperial canal, and passed by <HI>Yang-choo,</HI> a great and populous city, in Lat. 32° 25′, flourishing by its being the staple of the salt trade; that useful article, made on the sea-shores, is brought here by the lesser canals, and by the same means transported to most parts of the empire; for they extend in many directions westward, even to the borders of <HI>Tartary.</HI> The canal is continued northward on the side of the great lake <HI>Kao∣yeou-hoo,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">SINGULAR VESSELS.</NOTE> the same which Mr. <HI>Nieuhoff</HI> calls <HI>Piexe.</HI> Here the forms of the vessels are very singular; they are called <HI>Longschon</HI> or serpentine, and are used to carry fish, quite to <HI>Peking.</HI> These are represented in form of a serpent; from the prow issues the head, on which is placed an idol, with some live ducks pendent; from the stern is suspended a boy, who is playing all sorts of monkey tricks. The masts are decorated with numbers of flags, and serpents appear cut or painted in every part. It is manned with rowers, who with their broad oars, not unlike paddles, go with most astonishing celerity. It is incredible with what expe∣dition fish are conveyed fresh to <HI>Peking,</HI> even from distances of six hundred miles.</P>
<P>THE city of <HI>Yang-choo</HI> is infamous for its traffic in women.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">TRADE IN WOMEN.</NOTE> It produces the most beautiful in all <HI>China,</HI> particularly for the admirable smallness of their feet, and the symmetry of their bodies. They are trained from their childhood in every accom∣plishment, singing, dancing, painting, and composing of verses, but above all, in the practice of every lascivious attraction. These
<PB N="143" REF="157"/>unfortunate women form a vast article of commerce, and the merchant panders dispose of them to every part of the empire.</P>
<P>THE next city of note is <HI>Kajutsiu;</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">KAJUTSIU.</NOTE> then follows <HI>Hoin-gan-foo,</HI> seated on the river <HI>Hoai,</HI> near which are vast embankments to keep off the fury of the sea; all this neighborhood is marshy, yet extremely productive of rice. The whole country may have been gained from the watery element, yet it must have been many ages past, for a field near <HI>Hoin-gan</HI> is distinguished by the numbers of ancient <HI>tumuli.</HI> Many of the towns appear like <HI>Venice,</HI> built in the water, and some even below.</P>
<P><HI>Whay-ngan-foo,</HI> in Lat. 33° 32′, is one;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">WHAY-NGAN.</NOTE> it is built below the level of the great canal, which is near that city, supported by strong dykes. Here, very properly, one of those mandarines re∣sides who has the charge of the canal, and is called grand master of the waters. Not far from the west of it is the vast lake <HI>Hongtse-hoo,</HI> which just below the city is discharged into the great river <HI>Whang-ho</HI> or the <HI>Yellow River,</HI> which rises in Lat.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">RIVER WHANG-HO.</NOTE> 35° north, amidst the mountains of the <HI>Tartars</HI> of <HI>Kokonor,</HI> near the edge of the great desert <HI>Shamo</HI> or <HI>Gobi.</HI> Its course is about six hundred leagues, and the current so violent, that it is impossible for a ship to sail up the stream; it is liable to great inundations; insomuch that the inhabitants of the low province of <HI>Honan</HI> are obliged to surround their cities, at a small distance from their walls, with a strong mound. Mr. <HI>Nieuhoff</HI> exemplified this in his plate
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">At p. 117.</NOTE> The waters are of a yellow color, tinged with the strata they pass through, which is the origin of the name. This
<PB N="144" REF="158"/>river, in the neighborhood of <HI>Whay-ngan,</HI> notwithstanding its low latitude, 33° 32′, its great breadth, in that part of more than an <HI>English</HI> half mile, and its violent rapidity, is at times entirely frozen.</P>
<P>THE route to <HI>Peking</HI> is continued through two other provinces, <HI>Shan-tung</HI> and <HI>Pe-tche-lee.</HI> The rich, populous, and commercial city <HI>Tong-chang</HI> is in Lat. 36° 32′. This city has also its porcelain tower, being even externally made with that material, and with little bells pendant at each angle of its eight towers, which moved by the wind yield a pretty modulation.</P>
<P><HI>Kyo-Few Hyen</HI> is a city renowned for having been the birth place of the great <HI>Confucius,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">CONFUCIUS, WHERE BORN.</NOTE> so justly celebrated throughout the empire of <HI>China.</HI></P>
<P>MR.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">XANTSUI.</NOTE> <HI>Nieuhoff</HI> mentions several other places in this province, such as <HI>Xantsui,</HI> with the <HI>Teywanmiao,</HI> its remarkable pagoda, not distinguished for its grandeur,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">FINE PAGODA.</NOTE> but for the great beauty of the workmanship. It is rather low, and square, of a vast size, and inclosed within a most extensive wall made of stone, and the upper part of red and green tiles. The temple itself is of stones, mixed with yellow tiles (the imperial color) so resplendent as to appear like gold when shone upon by the sun; it is besides richly decorated with dragons and various <HI>Chinese Chimerae;</HI> the inside filled with monstrous idols. On the back part is a garden, de∣lightful as that of paradise, enriched with variety of fruits and flowers.</P>
<P><HI>Jax Hinno</HI> is a town distinguished by the multitude of square towers which rise in all parts,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">JAX HINNO.</NOTE> like our tower steeples; whether they are for defence or belonging to pagodas does not appear.</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="159"/><HI>Lintsin-choo</HI> is a city in Lat. 36° 57′,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">LINTSIN-CHOO.</NOTE> distinguished by the mul∣titude of vessels continually there in their passage to the capital, or different parts of the empire, as the great river <HI>Eu-teo</HI> unites here with the imperial canal. There is also a custom-house which brings in a vast revenue. Without the walls is a very splendid pagoda of nine stories; the outside is of the very fine earth with which porcelain is made, and richly painted.</P>
<P><HI>Te-tchoo,</HI> the last city in the province of <HI>Shantung,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">TE-TCHOO.</NOTE> is seated on the river, in Lat. 37° 32′. From hence we immediately enter into the province of <HI>Pe-tche-lee,</HI> the most northern in <HI>China.</HI> The navigation is continued to <HI>Tong-choo-soo,</HI> within a small distance of <HI>Peking,</HI> the latter part on the river <HI>Pei-ho,</HI> which flows from the northern capital of <HI>China</HI> into the gulph of <HI>Pe-tche-lee.</HI></P>
<P>ON the mountains near <HI>Sinkosien</HI> grow the eagle-wood trees and the <HI>Calamba;</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">EAGLE WOOD.</NOTE> both form great articles of commerce, and are sold even in <HI>China</HI> at a large price, but at still greater in <HI>Hin∣doostan,</HI> where so much is consumed by the Gentoos for burning their dead. Near this city is a most beautiful octagonal pagoda, consisting indeed but of three stages, but admirable for the roofs, of most exquisite workmanship.</P>
<P><HI>Single</HI> and <HI>Tien-sing-foo</HI> are the next cities.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">SINGLE AND TIEN-SING-FOO.</NOTE> The last is seated Lat. 39° 10′, on the conflux of three great rivers. On an island formed at that spot is a most singular castle, of a triangular form, truncated at the top; this is the greatest emporium in all <HI>China,</HI> and strongly fortified in the manner of the country; the resort of jonks, and all sorts of shipping, are incredible, it being a port free from tribute. The city is not large, but the suburbs so extensive as to make it one of the most populous in the em∣pire,
<PB N="146" REF="160"/>and are filled with palaces and pagodas. <HI>Nieuhoff</HI> imagines this city to have been the <HI>Quinsay</HI> of <HI>Marco Polo</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bergeron's Coll. p. 116.</NOTE> which he says "was like <HI>Venice</HI> built on a morass." The emperor, he informs us, had a magnificent palace here; and adds, that no less than six hundred thousand families were to be found in this vast place. What is singular, the <HI>Neslorians</HI> had a church in the city; a proof that Christianity was tolerated in this empire in the thir∣teenth century.</P>
<P>NEAR <HI>Joerwoe</HI> Mr.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">JOERWOE.</NOTE> <HI>Nieuhoff</HI> went along another canal, made in the river <HI>Chaolcang;</HI> he passed by <HI>Focheen, Sansianswey,</HI> and <HI>Tong-tchoo-foo.</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">TONG-TCHOO∣FOO.</NOTE> At the distance of four miles from <HI>Peking</HI> the na∣vigation ends. The reason assigned for its not being brought to the walls of the city is, that multitudes of the poor entirely sub∣sist by the carriage of goods and the necessaries of life into the capital. At this place the <HI>Dutch</HI> embassadors were met by a magnificent cavalcade of mandarines and people of rank, sent by the emperor to do them honor; and they entered the city in a most pompous procession. After being treated with the utmost external respect, they were dismissed without obtaining the end of their embassy.</P>
<P>I SHALL not attempt the description of this magnificent city, but will content myself with speaking to the eyes by the plates of Mr. <HI>Nieuhoff,</HI> which I believe represent with great fidelity the various cities, pagodas, and other buildings he passed by; in these may be seen the different forms of houses, and public edifices. The splendor of the emperor's palace, and a general view of the city, are shewn in the 158th page. The pagodas,
<PB N="147" REF="161"/>the idols, in various other pages, and the customs and dresses of the inhabitants are most frequently exhibited. In respect to the gardens of the <HI>Chinese,</HI> those of the private men are mentioned in the second volume of the <HI>Chinese</HI> Miscellany, and those of the emperor most admirably described by <HI>Le Frere Attiret,</HI> painter to the reigning monarch in 1743.</P>
<P>I NOW return to the latitude of <HI>Canton,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">COASTS OF CHINA.</NOTE> and pursue the to∣pography of the coasts. By reason of the great rigor with which the <HI>Chinese</HI> exercise their prohibition of trading in any of their ports except <HI>Canton,</HI> our knowledge of the shores or harbors is very confined. We shall have very little to say of an extent of between two and three thousand miles of coast, following the bending of the outline; the whole of which appears strangely rugged, with promontories, divided by bays, harbors, and creeks.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Ladrone</HI> isles,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">LADRONE ISLES.</NOTE> and those of <HI>Lema</HI> before the bay of <HI>Can∣ton,</HI> are lofty, rude, and broken; that of the <HI>Asses ears</HI> takes its name from two hills that assume the form. <HI>Piedra Biancas,</HI> far∣ther to the north, is a very high rock of a white color; both the last are marks to navigators.</P>
<P><HI>Foo-tchien,</HI> the province adjoining to <HI>Quang-tung</HI> on the north,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">FOO-TCHIEN.</NOTE> is a mountanous country, but the mountains, by the industry of the inhabitants, are formed into amphitheatres, with terraces, which often extend several miles in length, and a series of twenty or thirty, one above the other. The account given by <HI>Du Halde</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. i. 273.</NOTE> is so curious as to merit the attention of our readers. These are planted with rice, which is nourished by water forced
<PB N="148" REF="162"/>up to a great height, and conveyed to the different plantations in pipes of bamboo. This province is remarkable for its vast com∣merce, opulence, and population, and also for its amazing fertility.</P>
<P>AMONG the vegetable productions,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">ORANGES.</NOTE> it is distinguished for its fine oranges; one is very large, and its rind quite loose to the pulp, which has the taste and smell of the muscadine grape. This kind is candied, and sent to all parts of the empire; another is of a deep red; and a third very small. <HI>China</HI> is the native place of oranges, from whence they were communicated to the western world.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Li-chi</HI> and <HI>Long-ywen</HI> are fruits peculiar to the more southern parts of this empire,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">LI-CHI FRUIT.</NOTE> of most exquisite flavor, especially the first, which has of late years been most successfully intro∣duced into <HI>Bengal.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Hyamen,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A-MWY.</NOTE> or the port of <HI>A-mwy,</HI> is an excellent road for ships, in a deep bay, beneath the shelter of the isle of <HI>A-mwy,</HI> in Lat. 24° 27′. The island is flat and morassy, and garrisoned by about six or seven thousand men. Before the prohibitory edict it was much frequented by <HI>European</HI> ships. The <HI>Dutch,</HI> about the year 1645, made a treacherous attempt on the place; they came with five ships, and landed about three hundred men, who entered the town; the greater part of the inhabitants fled, but cunningly left in their houses abundance of spirituous liquors; this proved the bait they intended. The <HI>Dutch</HI> intoxicated themselves to a great degree; of this the fugitive citizens had notice; they re∣turned, surprised the invaders in their sleep, and put them all to the sword. The <HI>Chinese</HI> have preserved the history in large characters, on the face of a smooth rock near the entrance of the harbor.</P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="163"/>ON the isle of <HI>A-mwy</HI> is a vast rocking stone of forty tons weight, moveable by the slightest touch.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">ROCKING STONE.</NOTE> Whether it is treated with superstitious respect, as the <HI>Britons</HI> did their <HI>Loggan-stone, Hamilton</HI> does not inform us. A stone of this kind is found in <HI>Cachemire,</HI> which the <HI>Mullahs</HI> or priests say is moved by the miraculous power of the saint to whom it is dedicated.</P>
<P>THE great island of <HI>Formosa,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">ISLE OF FORMOSA.</NOTE> or <HI>Ta-wan</HI> as it is called by the <HI>Chinese,</HI> lies off the coast of <HI>Foo-tchien,</HI> at the distance of about sixty miles from the nearest place. The length is ninety leagues, the greatest breadth about thirty. It is of a curvated form, with the convexity facing the continent; the tropic of <HI>Cancer</HI> passes over it, at the distance of a hundred and five miles from the southern end, almost dividing it in equal parts. It is very sin∣gular, that notwithstanding its proximity it was unknown to the <HI>Chinese</HI> till the year 1430, when a eunuch of that nation, returning from the west, was driven there by a tempest. This was not imme∣diately productive of any consequences, nor did his countrymen profit of the discovery before the last century, when, in the reign of the emperor <HI>Kang-Hi,</HI> it was invaded by the famous <HI>Coxinga,</HI> who conquered at last the western part, not for the empire of <HI>China,</HI> but for himself. At that time the kings of <HI>Quang-tung</HI> and <HI>Foo-tchien</HI> had revolted from the empire. As soon as their rebellion was quelled, <HI>Kang-hi,</HI> in 1683, was put in possession of as much of <HI>Formosa</HI> as the young descendant of <HI>Coxinga</HI> had power to yield.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Japanese</HI> seized on this island about the year 1620. The <HI>Dutch,</HI> in their way from <HI>Japan,</HI> about the year 1633 made here a settlement. The manner of obtaining it, and their future
<PB N="150" REF="164"/>expulsion, has been given at p. 122 of this volume, in my account of their first commerce in these parts with the empire of <HI>China.</HI></P>
<P>THE coasts of <HI>Formosa</HI> are rude,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">PORT OF TA-WAN.</NOTE> lofty, and rocky. The prin∣cipal port is that of <HI>Ta-wan,</HI> the same with that which the <HI>Dutch</HI> took possession of. Near it is the capital city of the same name; unfortified, but garrisoned by ten thousand <HI>Tartars,</HI> and very populous, to which the <HI>Chinese,</HI> who are a commercial people, carry on a prodigious trade. There are besides three other cities and several villages, all inhabited by <HI>Chinese.</HI> The whole is remark∣ably fertile, productive of grain, and all the fruits which the cor∣respondent parts of <HI>China</HI> afford. As the whole of the island was inhabited by a barbarous people, domestic animals are in some degree scarce. Oxen are in use for riding instead of horses; stags abound; and among the wild animals, monkies; but it does not appear that tygers or beasts of prey are known in any part of <HI>Formosa.</HI></P>
<P>THE island is divided from north to south by chains of lofty and inaccessible mountains.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">NATIVES OF FORMOSA.</NOTE> The greater part of the western side is inhabited by <HI>Chinese,</HI> the natives have the eastern entirely to themselves; those which continue on the western are not better than servants to the colonists, except the inhabitants of three out of the twelve districts formed by the <HI>Chinese,</HI> which have revolted. The <HI>Formosans</HI> are a fine people, and of remark∣able swiftness, which they attain by practice, so that they can outrun a horse at full speed. Their shape is easy and slender, their complexions olive, and their hair fleck, and hanging over their shoulders. In the southern part of the isle they wear a linen wrapped round the middle, and falling to the knees: in
<PB N="151" REF="165"/>the northern, the skin of a stag made into a sleeveless jacket. Their bonnet is formed of <HI>Banana</HI> leaves, adorned with tufts of the feathers of cocks or pheasants.</P>
<P>THEIR morals have been much misrepresented by the <HI>Chinese</HI> and the Jesuits. They have no external worship, but a strong notion of a Supreme Being, which renders them a quiet, honest, and benevolent race. An inveterate hatred subsists between them and the <HI>Chinese.</HI> The last had reason to suppose that the island had its gold mines; but as they could not discover them in their part, they equipped a ship, and sailed to the eastern. They were received by the natives in the most humane manner, invited on shore, and furnished with every necessary. In this visit the <HI>Chinese</HI> observed in the poor cottages a few ingots of gold left negligently, as if of no value. This excited their avarice; they made their hosts drunk, and in their sleep cut all their throats, and carried away the gold, the incitement to this horrid action.</P>
<P>IT must not be forgotten,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">OF PSALMANA∣ZAR.</NOTE> that the history of <HI>Formosa</HI> was written by a person who pretended to be a <HI>Japanese</HI> converted to christianity, and to have fled from his country to avoid the dreadful punishment inflicted by the emperor on all proselytes. He assumed the name of <HI>Psalmanazar,</HI> and is generally sup∣posed to have been born in the south of <HI>France.</HI> He was a man of uncommon abilities. After leading a vagabond life through various parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> in which he acted the part of a most consummate impostor, and suffering frequently the greatest mi∣sery from his profligate life, he was reduced to become a com∣mon soldier in a <HI>Scotch</HI> regiment at <HI>Sluys;</HI> there he first assumed the character of the <HI>Japanese. Innes,</HI> a worthless chaplain of
<PB N="152" REF="166"/>the corps, undertook his conversion, not through principle, but the hopes of promotion on his arrival in <HI>England. Innes</HI> had dis∣covered him to be an impostor, but for their joint interest they united in the deceit. <HI>Psalmanazar</HI> formed a <HI>Formosan</HI> alphabet; he pretended to be converted in form, was baptized by <HI>Innes</HI> by the name of <HI>George,</HI> and the credulous governor of <HI>Sluys</HI> stood godfather. <HI>Innes</HI> had, by his correspondence with the good <HI>Compton,</HI> the bishop of <HI>London,</HI> been encouraged to bring him to our capital. The prelate was made most completely the dupe of these villains. <HI>Psalmanazar</HI> had many patrons and many op∣ponents, but his abilities and impudence baffled all detection. He undertook a history of <HI>Formosa</HI> (which he pretended was subject to <HI>Japan</HI>), a most fabulous composition; yet, as the <HI>English</HI> are always delighted with the marvellous, it was so gree∣dily bought up as to induce him to prepare a second edition. <HI>Innes</HI> attained his end, got preferment, and then basely deserted the cause of his promotion. <HI>Psalmanazar</HI> lived some time by various tricks and impostures. At length, at the age of thirty∣eight, he began to feel compunction at the infamy of his life, and was struck with most sincere remorse. He became a most lively penitent, and applied his great abilities to useful learning. He wrote his own life, which was not to be published till after his death. I believe it to be a true narrative, and that he con∣cealed nothing but his real name and the place of his birth, fearing to leave reproach upon his family. The list of his works, many of which are on important subjects, may be found in the <HI>Gentleman's Magazine</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. xxxv. p. 13.</NOTE>. He lived till <HI>August</HI> 1763, when he died
<PB N="153" REF="167"/>at the age of eighty; having long led an exemplary life, fully atoning for the irregularity of his early career.</P>
<P>THE isles of <HI>Pong-ho</HI> form an <HI>Archipelago</HI> off the western coast of <HI>Formosa,</HI> having the tropic passing over them.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">ISLES OF PONO-HO.</NOTE> They are destitute of all the necessaries of life, even to fuel, so that every thing must be brought from <HI>Formosa</HI> to supply the <HI>Chinese</HI> gar∣rison. They consist of only rocks or sand; yet, as they possess a fine port (which <HI>Formosa</HI> is destitute of), they become essential in the preservation of that great island. The <HI>Dutch</HI> built a fort at the entrance of the harbor, of which nothing except the name remains. The <HI>Chinese</HI> remember it by that of the fort of the <HI>Red hairs.</HI> It was the famous <HI>Coxinga</HI> who took these islands from the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and kept them for his own use.</P>
<P>THE province of <HI>Tche-Tchiang</HI> continues the maritime parts of <HI>China</HI> from <HI>Foo-tchien.</HI> This, like the rest,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">TCHE-TCHIANG.</NOTE> is amazingly com∣mercial; remarkable for its rich silks, embroidered with gold and silver; for its timber, vast forests of the useful <HI>bamboo;</HI> for its mushrooms, hams, and the vegetable tallow.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">SALT.</NOTE> Salt is made in abundance along the shores, and serves to cure the quan∣tities of fish taken on the coasts, which are packed in bar∣rels, and sent to the more distant provinces. The salt itself is transported to several of the internal parts within any reasonable distance; but those which border on <HI>Tartary</HI> are supplied from certain salt-pits, providentially given for the use of the inha∣bitants

<P>THIS province,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">PROVINCES GAINED FROM THE SEA.</NOTE> and that of <HI>Kyang-nan</HI> are supposed to have
<PB N="154" REF="168"/>been gained from the sea, as <HI>Holland</HI> was by the <HI>Dutch.</HI> The period is not justly known. The tradition of the <HI>Chinese</HI> is, that there had been a mighty deluge: in all probability that of <HI>Noah. Du Halde</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Du Halde, vol. i. p. 144.</NOTE> attributes to the emperor <HI>Yau</HI> the vast works which recovered these provinces from the sea. I will not dispute the learned Jesuit's skill in chronology; but the emperor began his reign in 2237 before <HI>Christ,</HI> and reigned a hundred years; the period in which he was born could not therefore have been long after the universal deluge.</P>
<P><HI>Le Poivre</HI> also informs us, that these provinces were, some thousand years ago, covered with water, and regained from the sea by the industry of the inhabitants. The immense mounds which guard it from the fury of the waves, are stupendous marks of the power of labor exerted by a most populous nation. They exceed all the similar dikes of <HI>Holland;</HI> besides, they have a much more powerful sea to resist than that which beats on the coast of the <HI>European</HI> low countries. <HI>Montesquieu</HI> attributes to the industry of the natives of these two provinces, their superior fertility to any in the <HI>Chinese</HI> empire.</P>
<P>In Lat.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">ISLE OF CHEW-SHAN.</NOTE> 30°, at a small distance from the coast, is the island of <HI>Chew-shan,</HI> or as we call it <HI>Chusan,</HI> mentioned in this volume at p. 115 as the first settlement the <HI>English</HI> had in <HI>China.</HI> It is sur∣rounded with many little isles, the remotest of which constitutes the most eastern part of the great curved shore of the empire.</P>
<P>AT the bottom of a long estuary stands the city of <HI>Ning-po,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">NING-PO, OR LIMPO.</NOTE> known to the <HI>Europeans</HI> by the <HI>Portuguese</HI> name of <HI>Liampo</HI> or <HI>Limpo.</HI> It is seated in the midst of a fine plain, cultivated like a
<PB N="155" REF="169"/>garden, surrounded with hills, and divided by a principal canal branching from it, with sixty-six others. On one of these canals, between <HI>Shau-hing-foo</HI> and this city, is an example of the singular method of passing from one level to another, and seemingly a very awkward one
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Embassy to China,</HI> vol. ii. p. 450, and plate 34 of the solio volume. E.</NOTE>. The waters of one canal not being on a level with that of another, the boat, by means of two capstans, is hoisted upon a stone glacis, or slope, which being made slippery with water, the boat glides down into the second canal, as swift as an arrow out of a bow. For this reason, they are made in form of <HI>Gondolas,</HI> with keels of a wood hard enough to sustain the weight of a bark. These boats are proper only for carrying goods from <HI>Ning-po,</HI> and the towns depending on it, as far as the canal of <HI>Shau-hing.</HI> They differ much, both as to size and make, from the imperial barks, which would be broken to pieces, or at least receive some considerable damage in the descent.</P>
<P><HI>Ningpo</HI> carries on a considerable trade with <HI>Batavia, Siam,</HI> and <HI>Japan.</HI> The <HI>Portuguese</HI> had early a settlement in this city, where they acquired immense wealth, and with it, all the vices atten∣dant on riches. Insolent and highly debauched,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">PROFLIGACY OF THE PORTUGUESE.</NOTE> they dared to seize the most beautiful young girls they could hear of, and em∣ployed a set of profligates for that purpose. When they had kept these poor victims as long as they thought proper, they returned them to the unhappy parents. Enraged at this, the <HI>Chinese</HI> cut off a party of the infamous <HI>Chasseurs.</HI> The <HI>Portu∣guese</HI> had the audacity to complain; the affair was brought before the highest tribunal; and such scenes of iniquity were discovered, that a decree was immediately made that the <HI>Portu∣guese</HI>
<PB N="156" REF="170"/>should instantly quit the empire; thus, says <HI>Hamilton</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. ii. p. 284.</NOTE>, "ended the most opulent colony at that time in the world."</P>
<P>To the north of this city an open bay runs deeply westward into the country, the vast estuary of the river <HI>Tchen-tang-tchiang</HI> The great city <HI>Hang-tchoo</HI> stands at some distance from its dis∣charge into the bay,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">HANG-TCHOO.</NOTE> on a spot where the river is a league broad; here is carried on a great manufactory of silk, as the province is distinguished for the cultivation of the worm. In <HI>Hang-tchoo</HI> sixty thousand workmen live within the walls, and several hundred thousand in the adjacent country.</P>
<P>NEAR this city is a most beautiful little lake called <HI>Si-hû,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">SI-HÛ LAKE.</NOTE> about two leagues in compass. The water quite crystalline; causeways are made through it for the convenience of walkers, and elegant open halls raised on posts for the amusement of the citizens. It is full of the famous golden fish,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">GOLDEN FISH.</NOTE> which shew to great advantage among the leaves and flowers of the <HI>Nymphaea,</HI> with which the lake is filled. This favorite fish of the <HI>Chinese</HI> is found in many other provinces; here it forms a species of commerce, the spawn and fry being transported to all parts of the empire which do not produce them.</P>
<P>THE golden fish is of the most vivid colors; <HI>Linnaeus</HI> names it <HI>Cyprinus auratus;</HI> the gold is highly resplendent, but varies in part of the same fish into the brightest silver or richest blues which can be imagined. It seldom reaches the length of eight inches, com∣monly is much smaller; has one dorsal sin, which sometimes is wanting, and the back marked by one or two small protuberances; in many the tail is most remarkable, being so formed as to exhi∣bit
<PB N="157" REF="171"/>the appearance of two, and even three tails. Mr. <HI>Edwards,</HI> tab. 209, and <HI>Bloch.</HI> iii. tab. 92. give figures of the varieties. They have been introduced into all parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> and will not only live but multiply prodigiously in our little stews.</P>
<P><HI>Du Halde</HI> gives the following account of the treatment of them in <HI>China:</HI>
<Q>The next thing remarkable (says the accurate historian) is the <HI>Kin-yu</HI> or golden fish; these are kept, either in little ponds, made for that purpose, wherewith the houses of pleasure belonging to the princes and great lords are embel∣lished, or else in basins, that commonly adorn the courts of their houses; in these basins, which are more deep than wide, they put the least that can be found; for the smaller they are, they think them the more beautiful; besides, the greater number may be kept of them, and they afford more di∣version.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THE prettiest of them are of a curious red, speckled as it were with gold dust, especially towards the tail, which is forked with two or three points; some are of a silver color, others white, and some spotted with red; both sorts are extraordinary lively and active, delighting to play on the surface of the water; but then their smallness renders them so tender, that the least impression of air, and even any violent shaking of the vessel, will kill great numbers of them. Those that are bred in ponds are of various sizes; some are bigger than our largest pilchards; they teach them to rise up to the top of the water at the noise of a clapper, which the person uses who feeds them. What is most surprising is, that according to all accounts, the best way to preserve them is to give them
<PB N="158" REF="172"/>nothing in winter; it is certain they do not feed them for three or four months at <HI>Peking,</HI> while the very cold weather lasts; what they live on in the mean time, under the ice, it is not easy to understand, except we suppose, either that they find little worms in the roots of herbs, which grow at the bottom of the ponds, or else, that pieces of roots them∣selves, being softened by the water, become proper food for them; but those which, to prevent their being frozen, are taken into the houses, and kept all winter in a chamber, often shut up in a china vessel, without being fed at all, are towards spring put into the basins again, where they sport with the same strength and agility as they did the year before. One would imagine they knew their masters, and those who carry them food, by their being so ready to rise at their ap∣proach. The greatest lords themselves delight in feeding them with their own hands, and spend some time to observe their nimble motions, and sporting in the water.</Q></P>
<P>FROM the estuary of the <HI>Tchen-tang-tchiang</HI> the land bends towards the north-west.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">PROVINCE OF KYANG-NAN.</NOTE> The next province to <HI>Tche-tchang</HI> is <HI>Kyang-nan.</HI> On the southern side of the entrance into the bay of the great river leading to <HI>Nanquin,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">ISLE OF TSONG-MING.</NOTE> is the island of <HI>Tsong-ming,</HI> ninety miles in length, in the breadth about twenty. It was originally a sandy spot overrun with reeds, to which it was custo∣mary to banish robbers and all kinds of profligates; necessity compelled them to industry; they cleared the ground, sowed the few seeds they brought with them, and by the assistance of some <HI>Chinese</HI> who came from the continent to settle among them, made a barren land fruitful. Other families arrived; the
<PB N="159" REF="173"/>island was divided among them, and the shares granted in per∣petuity, on the payment of a small yearly rent of the produce of their labor. It is at present well stocked with buffaloes and hogs, and bears the usual grain and fruits of the neighboring continent; among the last, it is remarkable for its fine peaches.</P>
<P>THE approach to <HI>Nanquin</HI> is now very difficult, the channel being obstructed by sand, so that the greater ships cannot enter. The <HI>Chinese</HI> possibly might remedy this, but it is supposed they wished rather to promote their inland trade than launch into distant commerce.</P>
<P>THE great and rapid <HI>Whang-ho-hoo</HI> also empties itself into the ocean near the northern boundary of this province.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">RIVER WHANG-HO.</NOTE> Some leagues farther, opposite to the little isle <HI>Yun-tay-shan,</HI> in about Lat. 34° 31′, begins the province of <HI>Shan-tung.</HI> From thence the land changes its course, and trends to the north-east as far as <HI>Chin-shan-wey.</HI> The correspondent coast to <HI>China,</HI> all the way from the mouth of the <HI>Yellow</HI> river, is the kingdom of <HI>Korea,</HI> and the intermediate space is named <HI>Whang-hay,</HI> or the <HI>Yellow</HI> sea. The promontory of <HI>Shan-tung</HI> advances greatly,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">YELLOW SEA.</NOTE> and forms the entrance into the gulph of <HI>Pe-che-li,</HI> which is bounded by part of the province of <HI>Shan-tung,</HI> of <HI>Pe-che-li,</HI> and of <HI>Lyau∣ting,</HI> a portion of <HI>Chinese Tartary,</HI> and finally by the western coast of <HI>Korea.</HI></P>
<P>WITHIN the gulph, in Lat. 37° 48′,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">TEN-CHOO-FOO.</NOTE> is the city and port of <HI>Ten-choo-foo.</HI> On the part of the province more salient, towards the north, a number of small isles stretch out still further. This port is a very fine one, and has a strong garrison and fleet to guard the coast.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="174"/>AMONG the productions of this province is the famous worm producing the silk mentioned by <HI>Pliny</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lib. vi. c. 17.</NOTE>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">SILK OF PLINY.</NOTE>, which that naturalist, with other antient writers, believed to have been a vegetable combed from the leaves and branches of trees. I vindicate his opinion so far as to say that it was collected from a plant, but he was ignorant that it was the produce of an insect. <HI>Du Halde</HI>
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Vol. i. p. 104.</NOTE> gives an account of its history, but leaves us in the dark as to the species of insect which yielded this kind of silk. Speaking of a certain sort of silk manufactured at <HI>Tri-nan,</HI> a city of this pro∣vince, he says, that the stuffs named <HI>Kyen-chow</HI> incline to a greyish color, which is produced only by the wild worms, re∣sembling caterpillars. These worms spin their webs on shrubs and bushes, and furnish as great quantities as the domestic worms. This silk is the more estimable, as it costs in a manner nothing, and so strong, that the goods made of it are very lasting, and have a tolerable vent every where.</P>
<P>THE gulph,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">PROVINCE OF PE-CHE-LI.</NOTE> from <HI>Ten-choo-foo,</HI> retires far towards the south, then returns northward, and in Lat. 38° 12′ begins the province of <HI>Pe-che-li,</HI> which in Lat. 39° takes a north-castern direction, and on the gulph finishes this great empire, in Lat. 40°. The capital, <HI>Peking,</HI> is about a hundred miles from the mouth of the <HI>Pei-ho,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">TIAN-SIN, PORT OF PEKING.</NOTE> on which is <HI>Tian-sin,</HI> the port of the capital. The river flows far to the south-west, out of the lake <HI>Tay-hoo.</HI> A canal joins it about thirty miles from the sea, and receives the vessels which are to discharge their ladings near to the imperial resi∣dence. This province was conquered in about 1324 from the <HI>Tartars,</HI> by <HI>Tay-tsu,</HI> the first emperor of the dynasty of <HI>My<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g;</HI>
<PB N="161" REF="175"/>he took the capital, <HI>Peking,</HI> in one day, erected the country into a sovereignty, and vested it in his fourth son.</P>
<P>THE empire ends about 150 miles farther, in Lat. 40° 45′.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">GREAT WALL.</NOTE> Here begins the celebrated wall, completed two hundred and twenty-one years before <HI>Christ,</HI> by the emperor <HI>Tsing-chi-whung,</HI> to protect the northern parts of <HI>China</HI> from the incursions of the <HI>Tartars.</HI> It appears first in the very sea, on a vast bulwark, founded on a number of ships, sunk by a wonderful weight of huge stones, to render immoveable the terminating super∣structure. The wall is all the way from twenty to twenty-five feet high, generally cased with brick, and terrassed at top of a breadth sufficient for five or six horsemen to ride a-breast. It passes along the frontiers of the provinces of <HI>Pe-che-li, Shan-si,</HI> and <HI>Shen-si;</HI> is guarded by a series of square towers or forts, at proper intervals, of only two bow-shots asunder; and has its gates often of a vast size, with rooms adjacent, fitted up as <HI>places d'armes,</HI> and peculiarly well garrisoned. At no great distance, in several cities, general officers are posted with considerable bodies of troops. The generalissimo resides at <HI>Kan-choo.</HI> Many of these cities are the magazines for the articles of commerce brought from different parts to be transported into the various provinces of the empire.</P>
<P>THIS great protection of <HI>China</HI> is not uniformly built of the same materials. In some places the walls, and even the forts, are of earth. In the district of <HI>Ning-hya,</HI> a few leagues from the city of the same name, the mountains are so high and precipitous as to supply the necessity of a wall for the space of ten leagues. In other places it is carried along vast and rugged mountains, almost
<PB N="162" REF="176"/>inaccessible, yet the fears of the <HI>Chinese</HI> urged them to prolong their defence even over the sides or summits of these alps, which direct its course, according to the nature of the country, over deep vallies or level plains. In a certain tract a great trench is cut to supply the place of the wall; and on the banks of the fierce river <HI>Whang-ho,</HI> or the yellow, are series of sentry-boxes, filled with soldiers, who keep watch night and day. As the wall must in its course pass over various great rivers, arches or bridges, of a stupendous height and strength, are thrown over them.</P>
<P>Later emperors,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">SECOND WALL.</NOTE> to give greater security to their capital, have built a second wall, at some distance from <HI>Peking,</HI> as strong as the first: It is called the great inner wall, and unites with the other by <HI>Wen-wha-fu.</HI> Near it is a city which rises and falls with the form of the mountain it is built on, and amazes the spectators with the boldness of the structure.</P>
<P>THE length of the wall, in a strait line, is seven or eight hun∣dred miles, and allowing for the windings, for the ascents over the craggy mountains, or descent into the deep vallies, may be estimated at double that length. Yet what may justly excite our admiration is, that this stupendous work was said to have been completed in the space of five years. In this empire of obedience every power was exerted to perform the commands of their common father, issued forth for the common security.</P>
<P>IMMEDIATELY beyond this bulwark begins the country of the antient <HI>Liau-tong,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">LIAU-TONG.</NOTE> or part of that of the <HI>Manchew Tartars,</HI> the last conquerors of <HI>China,</HI> and who gave the present imperial family to the throne. The gulph of <HI>Liau-tong</HI> runs deeply into the north of the country from the foot of the <HI>Chinese</HI> wall. This
<PB N="163" REF="177"/>territory has also its guard, but no better than a precinct of palisadoes with a few mean gates. The capital <HI>Mugden,</HI> which the <HI>Manchews</HI> look on as their metropolis, has a <HI>Tartarian</HI> commander in chief, and is inhabited by multitudes of <HI>Chi∣nese,</HI> who carry on the trade of <HI>Tartary.</HI> Just without the gates are the magnificent tombs of their antient princes. Pa∣per, made of cotton, is a great manufacture of this country, its principal use is for the sash windows of the palaces and houses of men of rank in <HI>Peking;</HI> those of glass have not reached even the cold latitude of so splendid a people.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">GING-SENG.</NOTE> <HI>Ging∣seng,</HI> the celebrated medicinal plant of the <HI>Chinese,</HI> is found in this country, and many parts of <HI>Chinese Tartary,</HI> of <HI>Korea,</HI> and even in the provinces of <HI>Shan-si</HI> and <HI>Ho-nan,</HI> in <HI>China</HI> itself; but the latter is of an inferior kind. It grows on the steeps of wooded mountains, or rocks, and on the banks of deep rivers. The root which is applied to use is said to be of the shape of a man. There is not a physician of eminence but who has cele∣brated its virtues; and exactly in the style of our empyrics. "It fortifies," says <HI>Shi-Chin,</HI>
<Q>the noble parts, keeps the body in good plight, fixes the animal spirits, cures the palpitations occasioned by sudden frights, dispels malignant vapours, clears the sight, opens and dilates the heart, and strengthens the judgment. When it is taken a considerable time together, it makes the body light and active, and prolongs life.</Q> In a few words, there is not a disease incident to the human body but what it infallibly cures. The <HI>Manchews</HI> style it <HI>Orhota,</HI> the <HI>most noble,</HI> or <HI>queen of plants;</HI> others the <HI>golden well bordered with pretious stones.</HI> There are extant nine antient receipts and sixty∣nine
<PB N="164" REF="178"/>modern.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">GING-SENG.</NOTE> The value of the root increases; it was formerly worth its weight in silver; "at present," says <HI>Du Halde</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. ii. 215.</NOTE>,
<Q>it is sold for nearly its weight in gold.</Q></P>
<P>IN 1709, when the great <HI>Kang-hi</HI> was on one of his pro∣gresses into his <HI>Manchew</HI> dominions, he was desirous to give his favorite <HI>Tartarians</HI> a valuable perquisite, and sent ten thousand of his soldiers to collect all the <HI>Ging-seng</HI> they could find. Each was to give him two ounces of the best, and to receive for the remainder an equal weight of fine silver. They sallied forth, and collected in the year twenty thousand pounds weight; but suffered sufficiently, for they were allowed neither tent or any sort of covering, and the places of search swarmed with tigers. Those who did not return on the signal of moving their quarters, were supposed to have been devoured by those dreadful animals.</P>
<P>IN the <HI>Chinese</HI> dominions <HI>Ging-seng</HI> grows between the thirty∣ninth and forty-seventh degree north Latitude, and between ten and twenty east Longitude from <HI>Peking:</HI> but is not confined to the old world; it was discovered in <HI>Canada,</HI> in 1704, by M. <HI>Sar∣rasin,</HI> who sent specimens to <HI>Paris.</HI> It was introduced into <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> in 1740, by the worthy <HI>Peter Collinson,</HI> and now flourishes in <HI>Kew</HI> garden. <HI>Linnaeus</HI> first called this plant <HI>Sion Ninsi,</HI> after∣wards <HI>Panax quinquefolium. Ehret.</HI> in <HI>Trew,</HI> tab. 6. names it <HI>Araliastrum;</HI> and <HI>Catesby,</HI> Appendix, tab. 16. <HI>Aureliana Cana∣densis,</HI> after <HI>Lafilau.</HI> Doctor <HI>Woodville,</HI> i. 270. retains the <HI>Linnaean</HI> name.</P>
<P>IN <HI>America</HI> it is not confined to <HI>Canada.</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">IN AMERICA ALSO.</NOTE> It is found even as
<PB N="165" REF="179"/>far south as <HI>Virginia</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gronov. Fl.

The Indians of <HI>America</HI> do not apply them to any use, but multitudes are em∣ployed in collecting them for sale to the merchants of <HI>Quebec.</HI> Our physicians depreciate the virtues of this root so much, that notwithstanding it has found a place in our dispensatory, yet is not mentioned in the <HI>Pharmacopoeia</HI> of the London College. The power of the medicine may possibly have been exaggerated in <HI>China,</HI> but I never can believe that a root so universally esteemed in that empire for ages can be destitute of virtues. Father <HI>Jar∣toux</HI> speaks highly of its qualities from his own experience, and on the very spot
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Phil. Trans. Abrig. iv. part ii. p. 315.</NOTE>. To him I give full credit, but at the same time shall observe that the trial he made was from the fresh roots. The experiments on which the <HI>English</HI> physicians founded their opinion, were from dried and exhausted specimens.</P>
<P>ADJACENT to the eastern side of <HI>Liau-tong</HI> is the peninsula of <HI>Korea,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">KOREA.</NOTE> extending from Lat. 42° 50′ to Lat. 34°, bounded on one side by the gulph of <HI>Pe-che-li,</HI> and the approach to it, on the eastern, by the <HI>Japanese</HI> gulph. <HI>Japan</HI> extends the whole length of the coast, and even stretches beyond its southern part. <HI>Korea</HI> is of an oblong form; about a hundred leagues in breadth; its greatest length extends a hundred and eighty.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">ITS SITUATION.</NOTE> It lies between three mighty nations, so that the inhabitants are a mixed people,
<PB N="166" REF="180"/>but call themselves of <HI>Tartar</HI> origin; boast of great antiquity; and produce some books which are two or three thousand years old. They have been conquered by the <HI>Chinese, Japanese,</HI> and <HI>Tartars;</HI> since the conquest of <HI>China</HI> by the latter, their yoke has been light; they only are obliged to send four ambassadors to <HI>Peking</HI> annually, to perform homage, where, after their audience from the emperor, they remain in a state of confine∣ment till their return. The <HI>Chinese</HI> fear that some time or other they may unite with the <HI>Russians,</HI> who have advanced far towards the <HI>Chinese</HI> frontiers; this may occasion a revolt, and the conse∣quences prove fatal to the repose of the empire.</P>
<P><HI>Korea</HI> had its wall to the north-west, which has long since been in a ruinous state; but even when complete, did not pre∣vent the conquest of the country by the <HI>Manchew Tartars.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Korea</HI> is mountainous, and not very fertile, except the vales. It is full of woods, and produces most of the European fruits and forest-trees. The southern part yields rice and excel∣lent grain. It breeds a hardy race of horses, exclusive of a small variety not three feet high; also cows, and black swine; abounds with various animals; among others are numbers of tigers, the skins of which are a considerable article of commerce in their intercourse with <HI>Japan.</HI> Among the noxious reptiles are cro∣codiles of an enormous size.</P>
<P>THEY have great quantities of feathered game, and a variety of birds; possibly many of those we have described in the <HI>Arctic Zoology,</HI> as belonging to the <HI>Tartarian</HI> or <HI>Siberian</HI> world. But the species of the pheasant kind, with feathers of the tail three feet long, are confined to this country. The feathers are sent
<PB N="167" REF="181"/>from <HI>Korea</HI> an article of commerce to various parts of the <HI>Chinese</HI> empire.</P>
<P>THE natives of the northern part are a fine race of men, tall,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">NATIVES.</NOTE> robust, active, and without any of the <HI>Tartarian</HI> aspect. Those of the southern part resemble the <HI>Chinese,</HI> of a sallow com∣plexion, and tender constitutions.</P>
<P>THEIR government is regular,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">GOVERNMENT.</NOTE> and its customs and laws re∣semble those of the <HI>Chinese.</HI> This makes it likely that their origin may more safely be derived from <HI>China</HI> than <HI>Tartary.</HI> The <HI>Chinese</HI> pretend that they were subdued as early as the reign of <HI>Yau,</HI> eighth emperor from <HI>Fo-hi,</HI> which may well account, if true, for the similitude of laws and customs. Their rulers are absolute and sole masters of the land, which is granted to every man according to his family; but the personal estate descends from father to son. Their religion is that of <HI>Fo,</HI> with all its superstitions; they are very fond of literature, and have triennial examination of Doctors, Bachelors, and Masters of arts. These adopt the pure doctrine of <HI>Confucius,</HI> and despise the ridiculous idolatry of <HI>Fo.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Koreans</HI> of rank are very splendid in their habits, wear fur caps and brocade cloaths; and affect purple-colored silk richly ornamented with gold and silver. Furs are much in use. The learned are distinguished by two feathers in their caps.</P>
<P>THE productions of the country are <HI>Ginseng,</HI> cotton, paper,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">PRODUCTIONS.</NOTE> gold, silver, iron, mineral salt, the skins of sables and beavers; and a beautiful varnish which resembles gilding, made from the gum of a tree.</P>
<P>THE natives carry on a great commerce with <HI>China;</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">TRADE.</NOTE> about
<PB N="168" REF="182"/>sixty merchants attend the annual ambassadors; they travel in <HI>March,</HI> and cross the ice of the gulph in sledges; so severe is the cold, even in this latitude! Others go in <HI>August</HI> in large vessels, discharge their cargoes in the <HI>Chinese</HI> ports, and carry it by land to <HI>Peking.</HI> They bring with them great quantities of the window paper, umbrellas, fine mats, tobacco, striped cotton, furs, and dried fish taken from a large shell on the coast of <HI>Japan.</HI> This dried fish is only a covert to the other articles of commerce. They import besides great quantities of gold and silver in ingots, and part in <HI>Spanish Pistoles,</HI> and carry back prodigious cargoes of raw and fine silk, which they manufacture at home; thin silks, the kind called by the <HI>Chinese, Kao-li-Toanza,</HI> or <HI>Korean</HI> damask; tea, vast quantities of cotton, china ware, and white copper ves∣sels of all sorts.</P>
<P>THAT penetrating writer, Mr. <HI>Campbell,</HI> has given an excel∣lent account of the commerce of this people. My plan is of that confined nature, that I must content myself with a reference; and request the reader's perusal of Mr. <HI>Campbell</HI>'s
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. ii. 1000.</NOTE> account, in his collection of voyages, which will amply repay them.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Koreans</HI> trade openly with <HI>China,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">WITH CHINA, &amp;c.</NOTE> clandestinely with <HI>Japan,</HI> the <HI>Phillippine</HI> isles, and perhaps <HI>Java;</HI> under the general notion of their being <HI>Chinese,</HI> they may traffick in disguise to many other places. Their trade with the nations to the north, and north-west, and probably with the <HI>Russians</HI> of their <HI>Asiatic</HI> dominions, comes under the same description; all this is strictly prohibited by the <HI>Chinese</HI> emperor; who even keeps a Mandarine at the <HI>Korean</HI> court, to take care that the order be observed; this precaution, with so corrupt a nation, has very little effect.</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="183"/>THE intercourse to the north,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">RUSSIANS.</NOTE> is the most dreaded by the <HI>Chinese.</HI> The <HI>Russians</HI> have made great advances on that side, and had formed settlements on the <HI>Amur,</HI> which runs through the northern part of the empire. This brought on more than one war. The <HI>Koreans</HI> are said either to navigate the river <HI>Songor,</HI> or the <HI>Schingal,</HI> till they arrive in the <HI>Amur;</HI> or to sail along the coast, and proceed directly up its mouth, and trade either with the subjects of <HI>Russia,</HI> or possibly with the <HI>Russians</HI> themselves. All the intervening track from <HI>Korea</HI> is affectedly given wrong by the <HI>Chinese,</HI> in order to keep both their own subjects and those of <HI>Russia</HI> in ignorance; but in vain; the <HI>Koreans</HI> are a match for them in cunning. They pretend in their voyage up the <HI>Amur</HI> that they come from some distant isle. <HI>Ysbrande Ides</HI> informs us of this, but without knowing that they imposed on him. They trade even with the <HI>Manchew Tartars,</HI> subjects of the emperor; but these people, for gains sake, content themselves with the deception. From them, and from the <HI>Russians,</HI> or <HI>Russian</HI> subjects, they procure the quantities of furs which they pretend are the produce of their own country.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Koreans,</HI> having their country three parts surrounded by the sea, must naturally be a naval people; they trade com∣monly with <HI>Japan,</HI> and obtain the articles of commerce of those islands.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">WITH JAPAN.</NOTE> The <HI>Japanese</HI> have ceded the little intermediate isle of <HI>Susima,</HI> the <HI>Tuitatao</HI> of the <HI>Koreans,</HI> on purpose to facilitate the trade.</P>
<P>By the pretence of sailing to the island of <HI>Quel-praet,</HI> seated to the south of the peninsula, to take in the <HI>Chinese</HI> manufacture
<PB N="170" REF="184"/>from the magazines formed there, they proceed on the east side of <HI>Formosa,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">MANILLA.</NOTE> and to <HI>Manilla,</HI> where they trade under the name of <HI>Chinese,</HI> and by this means acquire such quantities of <HI>Spanish</HI> silver; they likewise get abundance of ducats in <HI>Japan,</HI> ex∣changing their ingots for specie; with this silver they pay for great part of the manufactures of <HI>China.</HI></P>
<P>THEY do not purchase any <HI>European</HI> goods in <HI>China,</HI> yet <HI>Korea</HI> abounds with those of our distant world; these are pro∣cured in the <HI>Phillippines,</HI> or at <HI>Batavia;</HI> spices, and several other insular commodities, are bought in the same market; from that of <HI>Manilla,</HI> they bring amethysts and emeralds; the last cer∣tainly from the mines of <HI>Atacames, Manta,</HI> and <HI>Santa-Fe</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ulloa, vol. i. 81. 506.</NOTE>, in <HI>Spanish America.</HI> Their intercourse with the Oriental islands must have been long, for Mr. <HI>Campbell</HI> observes, that the people who were so cruelly murdered by the <HI>Dutch,</HI> in <HI>Amboina</HI> in the year 1622, for the pretended conspiracy with the <HI>English,</HI> were <HI>Koreans,</HI> and not (as they are called) <HI>Japanese.</HI> But there is no limiting the period of trade among these distant nations, forward as we have shewn them to be in the arts of navi∣gation.</P>
<P>I SHALL conclude the account of this singular country, with a view of the adjacent nations, whether dependent or indepen∣dent on this mighty empire.</P>
<P>THE kingdoms on the south are <HI>Tonquin</HI> and <HI>Laos;</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">NATIONS ADJACENT TO THE CHINESE EMPIRE. AVA, THIBET.</NOTE> a small part of <HI>Pegu</HI> advances a little into the south-west, and the northern end of <HI>Ava</HI> borders on the lower part of the province of <HI>Yunan.

These <HI>Tartars</HI> have among them a coarse woollen manufacture, which they dispose of to the <HI>Chinese.</HI> Inaccessible and rude mountains lie to the south of that people, inhabited by a most savage race, so as to cut them off from all intercourse with the still more southern countries.</P>
<P>LET me here introduce some account of the celebrated drug,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">OF RHUBARB.</NOTE> the Rhubarb, of which <HI>Tartary</HI> and <HI>China</HI> is the seat. The rhubarb of all the medicinal kinds is found in great abundance in several parts of the <HI>Chinese</HI> dominions, and even in <HI>China</HI> itself. In the province of <HI>Se-chwen,</HI> in the mountains of <HI>Snow,</HI> in <HI>Shen-si,</HI> where troops of camels are loaden with nets full of rhu∣barb in the months of <HI>October</HI> and <HI>November:</HI> it abounds also in <HI>Tanguth</HI> about the lake <HI>Koko-nor, Little Bucharia,</HI> and all the chain of hills from lake <HI>Baikal</HI> westward. It grows south as far as <HI>Quang-tung;</HI> but the southern rhubarb is little esteemed, yet much of it comes to <HI>Europe</HI> by sea; I may add, that out of the <HI>Chinese</HI> empire it is found in <HI>Thibet.</HI></P>
<P>RHUBARB was known to <HI>Dioscorides,</HI> who lived in the reign of <HI>Nero,</HI> as a valuable purge; and <HI>Paulus Aeginetus,</HI> a physician of the seventh century, prescribed it for the same purpose. It was brought from the remotest parts of the ancient <HI>Scythia,</HI> and the use was continued through all succeeding ages, without any cer∣tain knowledge of the plant to which the roots belonged. <HI>Marco Polo</HI> observed it on the rocky mountain near <HI>Suchur,</HI> in the pro∣vince of <HI>Tanguth,</HI> and says it was sent to all parts of the earth; for it found its way to <HI>Europe</HI> from those distant regions even in that early time.</P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="186"/><HI>Gerard</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 393.</NOTE> gives a figure of the well known rhubarb of our gardens, with roundish crisped leaves. This he names, very properly, <HI>Rha verum antiquorum. Parkinson</HI> gives another
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">P. 484, 485.</NOTE> in his <HI>Paradisus terrestris,</HI> which he procured from Doctor <HI>Mathew Lister,</HI> physician to <HI>Charles</HI> I. This is acknowledged, from both their accounts, to be weaker than the other kind which came from <HI>China;</HI> it is frequent in our gardens. I do not remember that the roots were ever applied to medicinal uses, but of the tender shoots of the leaves, are made excellent tarts, in the early summer, not inferior in taste to the codling.</P>
<P>THE plants which produce the true rhubarb have been but lately discovered; the seeds of the <HI>Rheum Palmatum</HI> were sent from <HI>Russia</HI> by the late Doctor <HI>Mounsey,</HI> to Doctor <HI>Hope</HI> of <HI>Edin∣burgh,</HI> in 1763. He sowed them in the botanical garden; they succeeded greatly; and he, with his usual liberality, commu∣nicated them to the curious. He drew up an account of the plant, and inserted it, attended with most accurate plates, in vol. lv. p. 290, of our Phil. Transactions. Doctor <HI>Woodville</HI> gives also a good figure of the plant at p. 227 of his medicinal botany; as to that referred to by <HI>Linnaeus (Le Brun</HI>'s travels, i. p. 188, 189) it seems of some other species of <HI>Rheum</HI>
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The <HI>Rheum Rhaponticum,</HI> cultivated in our <HI>English</HI> gardens. F.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THAT most excellent character the Duke of <HI>Athol,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">CULTIVATED IN SCOTLAND.</NOTE> propagated it with great success, not only in his garden, but on the highland mountains that surround his seat at <HI>Athol.</HI> His benevolent de∣sign of rendering common and cheap this useful medicine, is blest with the utmost success. The roots which he cul∣tivated in the light soils, similar to those of the <HI>Tartarian</HI> deserts,
<PB N="173" REF="187"/>the native place, encrease to a vast size; some, when fresh, have been found to weigh fifty pounds, and to be equal in smell, taste, and effect to those we import at an enormous expence to our country. On being dried, they shrink to one quarter of their original weight. There is reason to suppose that the <HI>Scotch</HI> rhubarb may be superior in virtue to the foreign, the last being gathered in all seasons, as the <HI>Mongall</HI> hunters chance to pass by. They draw up the roots indiscriminately, pierce them at one end, sling them on their belts, and leave them to dry on their tents without further care. In all probability the time is not remote in which the <HI>British</HI> rhubarb will supersede the necessity of the use of the foreign.</P>
<P>BUT there are other kinds which are said to be equally effi∣cacious with the <HI>Rheum Palmatum,</HI> such as the <HI>Rheum Rhabar∣barum</HI> of <HI>Linnaeus,</HI> the <HI>Undulatum</HI> of the <HI>Hortus Kewensis,</HI> with long waved leaves; the <HI>Rheum Compactum,</HI> a third species, boasts of the same virtues; <HI>Miller</HI> had the seeds sent to him as those of the true kind. The <HI>Rheum Rhaponticum</HI> is besides met with in <HI>Tartary</HI> about lake <HI>Baikal,</HI> as well as most of the others. This is the species which gave the name of <HI>Rhubarb</HI> or rather <HI>Rhabarb</HI> to this drug, the plant being first observed near to the banks of the ancient <HI>Rha,</HI> or river <HI>Volga;</HI> the same pre∣scribed by <HI>Paulus Aeginatus</HI> as one of the ingredients for a purge, under the name of <HI>Rheum Ponticum;</HI> perhaps the trivial might be derived from its being brought from some part of <HI>Pontus,</HI> to which it was carried from its place of growth. <HI>Pliny</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lib. xxvii. c. 12.</NOTE> mentions a plant with a medicinal root called <HI>Rhacoma;</HI> he says it came
<PB N="174" REF="188"/>from the countries beyond the kingdom of <HI>Pontus,</HI> and by the name, probably from the <HI>Rha.</HI> He describes its uses, but none of them are similar to that of the rhubarb; I cannot therefore venture to say that it is the same plant.</P>
<P>IN <HI>Chinese Tartary</HI> the <HI>Bobak Marmots,</HI> (Hist. Quad. ii. N<SUP>o</SUP> 324) are said to be the propagators of Rhubarb. Wherever ten or twenty plants grow you are sure of sinding several burrows under the shades of their broad spreading leaves. It is probable the ma∣nure they deposit about the roots contributes not a little to its in∣crease; and their casting up the earth makes it shoot out young buds and multiply. It appears that the <HI>Mongalls</HI> never accounted it worth cultivating; but that the world is obliged to the <HI>Marmots</HI> for the quantities scattered, at random, in many districts of this country. For whatever part of the ripe seed happens to be blown among the thick grass, can very seldom reach the ground but must there wither and die; whereas, should it fall among the loose earth thrown up by those animals, it immediately takes root, and produces a new plant.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Chinese</HI> call rhubarb <HI>Tay-whang;</HI> they use it nearly in the same manner as is done in <HI>Europe;</HI> esteem its virtues much as we do, except that which comes from <HI>Canton:</HI> the greatest part of the <HI>Tartarian,</HI> or most valuable, is engrossed by the <HI>Russians,</HI> who purchase it at their town of <HI>Kiachta</HI> (a little south of lake <HI>Bai∣kal)</HI> from <HI>Bucharian</HI> merchants, and send it to <HI>Petersburgh.</HI> This is called the <HI>Turkey Rhubarb,</HI> because formerly it was brought from <HI>Constantinople,</HI> the merchants there receiving it from the <HI>Bucharians,</HI> who now find a readier market near home. The <HI>Chinese</HI> prohibit the exportation of the best rhubarb under
<PB N="175" REF="189"/>severe penalties, but much of it is procured, either by concealing it mixed with roots of inferior quality, or by a contraband trade. The <HI>Russian</HI> government is very attentive to the business, and appoints at <HI>Kiachta</HI> persons to inspect the drug, and to reject all that is bad.</P>
<P>ALL this extensive tract has a most elevated situation,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">ELEVATED COUNTRY.</NOTE> giving rise to numbers of great rivers, which, running southward, water the several parts of <HI>India,</HI> both <HI>intra</HI> and <HI>extra Gangem:</HI> the <HI>Ganges</HI> itself is one: the <HI>Burrampooter,</HI> or <HI>Tsampoo</HI> of the <HI>Chinese,</HI> another, with the various contributary streams that fall into those amazing rivers: the river of <HI>Arrakan</HI> may be added to the list; as to those of <HI>Ava, Pegu, Siam,</HI> and <HI>Cambodia,</HI> each of them originate in the south of <HI>China.</HI> The elevated plains of this part of <HI>Asia</HI> did not escape the notice of <HI>Marco Polo,</HI> for he mentions his journey of twelve days over one called <HI>Pamer</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bergeron, p. 31.</NOTE>; and asserts that he found on those heights the fire to burn with difficulty, by reason of the excessive cold and rarefaction of the air. These plains are on the north of <HI>Cashgur,</HI> and to the west of <HI>Little Bucharia.</HI></P>
<P>THE immense deserts of <HI>Gobi,</HI> or as the <HI>Chinese</HI> call them,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">DESERTS OF SHAMO.</NOTE> <HI>Shamo</HI> and <HI>Hankai,</HI> are dreadful boundaries to the north and north∣west of the <HI>Chinese</HI> dominions. They consist of sands that move with the winds like the current of a river. Nature has formed three passagesacross them, by means of three chains of mountains, which run from the great <HI>Tartary,</HI> and are mixed with pleasant vallies amidst these oceans of sand. Travellers who take any other course are liable to be overwhelmed with the torrents of
<PB N="176" REF="190"/>sand, equally dangerous with the deserts of <HI>Arabia.</HI> The first of these communications is in Lat. 42° north, to the E. N. E. of <HI>Peking;</HI> the second to the east of the province of <HI>Shen-si;</HI> and the third in Lat. 32° to the east of <HI>Hami,</HI> on the frontiers of <HI>Thibet.</HI> By these means a safe access was given from the vast <HI>Tartarian</HI> regions, and through them, from the countries bor∣dering on the <HI>Caspian</HI> sea, and more remotely from <HI>Europe</HI> itself; they were the roads of the travellers and merchants of the middle ages.</P>
<P>ADJACENT to the south-western parts were some important cities well known to those adventurers,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">HIERKIN. CASHGUR.</NOTE> such as <HI>Hierkin,</HI> and <HI>Cash∣gur,</HI> already mentioned in this work
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Outlines of the Globe, vol. i. p. 8.</NOTE>, to which <HI>Ptolemy</HI> gives the names of <HI>Comedae</HI> and <HI>Casia Regio;</HI> the first is supposed to have been <HI>Cashgar,</HI> the capital of <HI>Casia Regio; Hierkin,</HI> the <HI>Carcham</HI> of <HI>Marco Polo,</HI> p. 34, is conjectured to have taken its name from its situation on the <HI>Aechardes,</HI> a river which runs from the north∣east, and was remarkable as a station which merchants trading with the <HI>Seres</HI> had in the very neighborhood. In the time of our great traveller the inhabitants were <HI>Mahometans,</HI> intermixed with a few <HI>Nestorians.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Hoton</HI> or <HI>Coton,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">HOTON.</NOTE> a province to the south-east of <HI>Hierkin,</HI> bor∣dering on the desert, is supposed to have belonged to the ancient <HI>Chatae.</HI> It is very populous; the inhabitants are commercial, cultivate cotton,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">PEYM.</NOTE> flax, hemp, and wheat, and make wine. <HI>Peym</HI> is another province productive of Chalcedonies and Jaspers. The capital of the same name is in Lat. 38. These places, and many others mentioned by <HI>Polo,</HI> are to be found in the modern maps.</P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="191"/><HI>Lop,</HI> the city visited by <HI>Marco Polo,</HI> lies in Lat. 41°,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">LOP.</NOTE> and is seated on a lake, which gave name in his time to the great desert. At <HI>Lop</HI> the travellers always stop to provide themselves with mules or strong asses, and provisions for their toilsome journey over the barren waste, which takes a whole month. <HI>Marco Polo</HI> seems to have crossed it in the most difficult part, for the entire tract consisted of unstable sands or rugged mountains, uninha∣bitable by even birds or beasts, with scarcely any water, and that usually bitter. At length he arrived at the city of <HI>Sachion,</HI> the modern <HI>Shatcheu,</HI> at the entrance into the kingdom of <HI>Tan∣guth.</HI></P>
<P>NOT far from thence is <HI>Camul,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">CAMUL.</NOTE> a city to be found in the old maps. <HI>Polo</HI> celebrates the great kindness of the inhabitants, who on the arrival of any strangers, immediately surrender to them their wives and houses, and retire for the time to other habita∣tions. He adds, that <HI>Mangu Khan,</HI> shocked at the indecent custom, directed them to build inns for the reception of the tra∣vellers. This, these contented <HI>Cornuti</HI> took in such ill part, that they never rested till by presents and remonstrances they pre∣valed on the <HI>Khan</HI> to revoke the edict.</P>
<P>FURTHER, in Lat. 44° 11′, Long. 107° from <HI>Greenwich,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">KARAKARIN.</NOTE> stood <HI>Karakarin,</HI> the <HI>Holin</HI> of the <HI>Chinese,</HI> the capital of the antient <HI>Mongois,</HI> founded before the twelfth century, or the time of <HI>Jenghiz Khan.</HI> It was previous to his reign an inconsiderable place, and the residence of <HI>Ung, Khan</HI> of the <HI>Karaites,</HI> when <HI>Jenghiz</HI> wrested it from him. The conqueror improved it greatly, and his son <HI>Oktay Khan</HI> rebuilt it with great splendor about the year 1225; ten years afterward he surrounded it with
<PB N="178" REF="192"/>walls, of no better materials than of mud; but his palace called <HI>Wangan,</HI> was of great magnificence. <HI>Rubriquis</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 106 and 95.</NOTE> gives a full account of it to his master. He informs us that <HI>Wil∣liam</HI> the <HI>Goldsmith</HI> was employed in the ornamental work. The famous silver tree in one of the courts was in a fine taste.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">SILVER TREE.</NOTE> At the foot of the tree were four lions, the same number of gilt serpents twined round the stem, and their heads appeared out of the branches pointing different ways, spouting various liquors, one of wine, another of <HI>Caracosmos,</HI> or the liquor of mares milk; the third made of honey; the fourth of rice; and each fell into a great silver cistern placed beneath. On the summit of the tree was an angel with a trumpet, which sounded by the help of a pipe blown by a man artificially concealed. All this shewed taste in the <HI>Khan,</HI> as well as beauty of design in the artist. This city, placed in the middle of the desert, on a salient chain of mountains, might well astonish the traveller with its population, and the splendor of its palaces. These parts of <HI>Tar∣tary</HI> were about that period full of opulent cities, but little more than the site of them, or of <HI>Karakarin</HI> itself, was discoverable by the Jesuits who were employed by the emperor in the vast work of the survey of his <HI>Tartarian</HI> dominions. The labors of the Fathers <HI>Regis, Fidelli,</HI> and many others, are comprised in twelve maps, in the second volume of <HI>Du Halde.</HI> In the third sheet is shewn the situation of this once famous city; and in some of the others, the whole of the desert which lies in the <HI>Chinese</HI> terri∣tories. The chains of communication are expressed; and the roads, which the more hardy travellers ventured over, amidst the trackless sands.</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="193"/>THE part of this desert which is clamed by the <HI>Chinese,</HI> be∣gins in Lat. 35° north, and in Long. 112° 30′ east from <HI>Paris,</HI> winds towards the north-east as high as <HI>Halter Gobi,</HI>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">TANGUTH.</NOTE> <HI>Rubruquis</HI> and <HI>Marco Polo</HI> travelled through, and describe its flourishing state, and the number of its cities. The friar is the first who mentions the ox with a tail like a horse, covered with silken hairs, the grunting ox, Hist. Quad. i. N<SUP>o</SUP> 8, since his days fully verified. <HI>Polo,</HI> in his road to <HI>Tanguth,</HI> passed through the great desert, which he names that of <HI>Lop.</HI> During night, says he, the caravans are terrified with the delusions of demons which haunt these horrid sands. The travellers must be careful how they stray, for they will imagine themselves to be called by their proper names by some of their comrades, till they are brought to the edge of a pre∣cipice; and sometimes they will be entertained with aerial music. Superstitions fitted to the dread of the place.</P>
<P>IT afterwards passes between the country of the <HI>Calmucs</HI> and the <HI>Kalkas</HI> to the north-west, the <HI>Ortus Tartars</HI> and the <HI>Mongols</HI> to the south, and concludes its course of above two thousand miles, from the borders of <HI>India</HI> to <HI>Halter Gobi,</HI> its remotest ex∣tremity. The extreme point to the south-west is not distant from the lakes <HI>Lanke</HI> and <HI>Mansaroar,</HI> the sources of the <HI>Ganges;</HI> and the lake which gives origin to the great <HI>Burrampooter.</HI></P>
<P>EVEN these deserts do not want inhabitants: some pittance is

<P>THE <HI>Chinese</HI> empire in <HI>Tartary</HI> extends to the north as high as Lat. 56° 32′. Its most western limit is not far from the southern end of lake <HI>Baikal,</HI> in Lat. 51° 30′, and Long. 100° 30′ west from <HI>Greenwich.</HI> It passes southward, with some irregularity, to the kingdom of <HI>Thibet;</HI> and has on that side, as a difficult limit, the great desert of <HI>Shamo.</HI> The northern boundary runs from the spot defined, near lake <HI>Baikal,</HI> eastward for some space, then turns northward along a vast and lofty range of mountains, the more antient seat of the <HI>Mongols,</HI> and at their extremity, not far from the source of the river <HI>Aldan,</HI> in Lat. 56° 32′, bends to the south-east, and concludes in the sea, in Lat. 54° 30′, to the north of the river <HI>Amur.</HI> All the tract between these lines and the em∣pire of <HI>China</HI> Proper are inhabited by <HI>Tartars,</HI> subject to or under the protection of the <HI>Chinese</HI> government. For the fur∣ther explanation, I refer to my friend the Reverend <HI>William Coxe</HI>'s <HI>Russian</HI> Discoveries
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Page 100.</NOTE>, and Mr. <HI>Arrowsmith</HI>'s Map of the World, but above all to the Travels of Father <HI>Gerbillon</HI> and other Jesuits, who followed the progresses of the great <HI>Kang-hi,</HI> or were employed in the actual survey of his vast empire. Their travels are given in the second volume of <HI>Du Halde</HI>'s History of <HI>China.</HI></P>
<P>THE boundaries were settled in 1689 by the treaty of <HI>Nert∣shinsk,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">TREATY OF NERTSHINSK.</NOTE> upon the river <HI>Ingoda,</HI> in the reigns of <HI>John</HI> and <HI>Peter,</HI>
<PB N="181" REF="195"/>afterwards surnamed <HI>The Great,</HI> and that of <HI>Kang-hi.</HI> The po∣litic <HI>Russians</HI> had long been endeavoring to make themselves masters of the important navigation of the river <HI>Amur,</HI> which in time might have given them the command of the <HI>Japanese</HI> and <HI>Chinese</HI> seas. This the <HI>Chinese</HI> foresaw, attacked and took a fort called <HI>Albasin,</HI> built by the <HI>Russians.</HI> They levelled it to the ground, and carried the garrison prisoners into <HI>China.</HI> This brought on an embassy from the <HI>Russians. Gallowin,</HI> governor of <HI>Siberia,</HI> was the embassador, attended by a most splendid train. <HI>So San,</HI> captain of the life guard and minister of state, and <HI>Tong Jau-ye,</HI> maternal uncle to the emperor, were embas∣sadors on the part of the <HI>Chinese,</HI> both men of the highest rank, and to them were added four others of the first distinction. The cunning of the <HI>Chinese</HI> was assisted by the subtlety of the Jesuits, for <HI>Kang-hi</HI> added to the negotiators Father <HI>Gerbillon</HI> and Fa∣ther <HI>Pereyra.</HI> The <HI>Chinese</HI> ministers had a suite inferior indeed in magnificence; but what gave the greater weight to the ne∣gotiation was, that the wise <HI>Kang-hi</HI> had added ten thousand men besides the escort, and which were attended by a fleet of seventy-six vessels, each carrying a piece of artillery. The <HI>Rus∣sians</HI> had fixed on <HI>Albasin</HI> as the place for settling the business; but to their surprise, the <HI>Chinese</HI> appeared suddenly before <HI>Nert∣shinsk,</HI> or, as they call it, <HI>Nip-chu,</HI> encamped near the place, and the whole business was transacted under tents. All this gave argument irresistible. The treaty was concluded. The <HI>Chinese</HI> offered to swear to the performance on the crucifix. <HI>Gallowin</HI> chose that they should swear by their own gods; and both couched the sacred appeal in these terms (imprecating the
<PB N="182" REF="196"/>Divine vengeance on the faithless party):
<Q>We, embassadors extraordinary of the two empires, having been sent to settle the bounds of both dominions, and establish a solid and per∣petual peace between both nations, which we happily exe∣cuted in the conferences held by us in the seventh moon of the 28th year of <HI>Kang-hi,</HI> near the town of <HI>Nip-chu,</HI> by distinctly setting down in writing the names of the countries and places where the two empires join each other, have, by fixing the bounds of both, and ordering in what manner such disputes as may fall out for the future are to be treated of; have mutually received an authentick writing, in which is contained the treaty of peace, and have agreed that the said treaty, with all its articles, shall be engraven on stone, to be fixed in the places appointed by us for the bounds of both empires, to the end that all who pass by those places may be fully informed thereof, and that this peace, with all its con∣ditions,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">OATH OF OBSERVANCE.</NOTE> may be for ever inviolably observed. But should any one have the thought only, or secret design, to transgress these articles of peace, or breaking his word and faith, should violate them out of private interest, or from the design of ex∣citing new troubles, and rekindling the fire of war, we pray the supreme <HI>Lord</HI> of all things, who knows the bottom of men's hearts, not to suffer such people to live out their days, but to punish them by an untimely death.</Q></P>
<P>I MAY here remark the observance of two very antient cus∣toms in the execution of this treaty;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A ROMAN FORM.</NOTE> the one in the manner of the oath, which agrees with that in use among the <HI>Romans,</HI> of which <HI>Polybius</HI> has lest us the following form, made on the oc∣casion,
<PB N="183" REF="197"/>and which remained in his days, cut on tables of brass, in the temple of <HI>Jupiter Capitolinus,</HI> in the archives of the aediles.</P>
<P><Q>THE first of these treaties was confirmed by oath in the following manner: The <HI>Carthaginians</HI> swore by the gods of their country, and the <HI>Romans</HI> by a stone, agreeably to an antient custom; and by <HI>Mars Enyalius.</HI> The ceremony of swearing by a stone was thus performed: the person that was appointed to this office, having first solemnly attested the publick faith for the due observance of the treaty, took in his hands a stone, and pronounced the following words—'If I swear truly, may the gods be propitious to me: but if I think or act any thing that is contrary to my oath, then let the rest enjoy in safety their country, laws, possessions, house∣hold gods, and sepulchres; and let me alone be cast out from the society, as this stone is now cast away.' At the same time he threw away the stone
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hampton's Polybius, book iii. chap. iii. p. 214.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>THE other custom was one of the earliest date on this very continent,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">COLUMNS ME∣MORIAL.</NOTE> that of preserving the memory of any remarkable transactions by pillars of stone. Thus we find in <HI>Genesis</HI>
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Chap. xxxi. v. 51.</NOTE>, that the treaty between <HI>Laban</HI> and <HI>Jacob</HI> was confirmed and per∣petuated by the erection of a pillar and a heap of stones. The <HI>Chinese</HI> embassadors raised two pillars on the spot, to determine the boundaries of the respective empires, and on them engraved the treaty.</P>
<P>IT was the intention of the <HI>Russians</HI> to have made the <HI>Amur</HI> the limits of their empire.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">RIVER AMUR.</NOTE> This vast river is formed originally
<PB N="184" REF="198"/>by the junction of the <HI>Onoa</HI> and the <HI>Schilka,</HI> to the west of <HI>Nert∣shinsk.</HI> From thence it flows easterly, takes a vast bend southernly, and then returns to the north-east, and falls through a mouth four or five leagues wide into the lower part of the sea of <HI>Ochotzk,</HI> opposite to the great island <HI>Sachalin,</HI> in Lat. 53°. The <HI>Tartars</HI> call the river <HI>Sachalin ula,</HI> or the black river; the <HI>Chi∣nese, Helong Kiang,</HI> or the river of the <HI>black dragon;</HI> and the <HI>Russians,</HI> the <HI>Amur.</HI> It was first known to them in 1639, by means of some <HI>Cosacks,</HI> sent on an expedition towards the river <HI>Witim.</HI> According to <HI>Du Halde</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. ii. p 311.</NOTE>, it is navigable for large barks for the space of five hundred leagues.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Russians</HI> were charmed with the discovery of a river which report made to fling up gold and silver; and its neigh∣borhood to abound with the most pretious sables, cattle, fruit, and grain; and its inhabitants to be clad in nothing but damask and gold brocades: in short, it was represented as a land of <HI>Ca∣naan.</HI> The <HI>Russian</HI> colonists of the neighboring places migrated thither in crowds, and depopulated their former country. They founded a fort in Lat. 53°,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">FORT ALBUSIN.</NOTE> which they called <HI>Albasin,</HI> the <HI>Chinese, Jaksa,</HI> from the river near which it was seated. The <HI>Chinese</HI> burnt it in 1680; but it was resounded, and at length strongly garrisoned, till it gave such serious cause of jealousy to that na∣tion as to bring on the treaty which occasioned its total demoli∣tion. It is no wonder that they were alarmed: the borders of the river were remarkably fertile, had numbers of large cities, and a most populous territory; besides, the mountains to the
<PB N="185" REF="199"/>north were productive of the richest sables and other furs, and inhabited by a hardy race of hunters. Had the <HI>Russians</HI> rendered themselves masters of the <HI>Amur,</HI> even <HI>Katherine,</HI> the moderate, might have made the <HI>Chinese</HI> tremble for the fate of <HI>Peking</HI> itself.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Chinese</HI> had several places on the <HI>Argun</HI> of some im∣portance, such as <HI>Aigun,</HI> or, as it is called by them,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">AIGUN.</NOTE> <HI>Sachalin ula Choton,</HI> near the junction of the <HI>Seja</HI> with that great river, a fort from which they detached their fleets against the <HI>Rus∣sian</HI> encroachments. <HI>Tondon</HI> is another town, in Lat. 50°, where the cold begins with great severity as early as the beginning of <HI>September;</HI> later in the year the greatest rivers are frozen over. Tigers inhabit even these high Latitudes. This country was visited and surveyed by some of the missionaries, by order of <HI>Kang-hi.</HI> Whoever wishes to gratify his curiosity farther, may consult <HI>Du Halde,</HI> vol. ii. p. 245, and the following pages.</P>
<P>THE country is full of forests; the missionaries were nine days in passing through one. They observed that the inha∣bitants of <HI>Usuni</HI> made use of sledges drawn by dogs, and persons of rank have sometimes a hundred to relieve each other on long journies on the snows or frozen rivers. The river of <HI>Usuri</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Du Halde,</HI> vol. ii. map the sixth.</NOTE>, which rises far to the south, and falls into the <HI>Amur,</HI> abounds with fish, mostly of species common to <HI>Europe.</HI> These serve the <HI>Ypi Tartars</HI> for food and raiment.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">YPI TARTARS.</NOTE> They are very inge∣nious in dressing the skins, which they dye of various colors, cut them into shape, and sew them so neatly that they ap∣pear like silk. Sturgeons swarm in these waters. The native
<PB N="186" REF="200"/><HI>Tartars</HI> make their boats of the bark of trees, sewed lightly to∣gether.</P>
<P>IT does not appear that the missionaries went farther than <HI>Tondon.</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">ISLE OF SAGA∣LIN.</NOTE> The report they had of the great island of <HI>Sagalin,</HI> or <HI>Saghalian anga hata,</HI> or the island of the mouth of the <HI>black river,</HI> was from some <HI>Manchews</HI> sent by the emperor in their barks. For want of necessaries, they were soon obliged to re∣turn. They observed certain villages; and that the inhabitants had neither horses or any beasts of burden, but made use of a sort of tame stags (rein deer) to draw their sledges. The island is said to be a hundred and eighty miles long and sixty broad. All the coast of the continent, from the part opposite to this island, as low as the northern boundary of <HI>Korea,</HI> is scarcely known; it bounds the western side of the streights of <HI>Yoso.</HI> What could be said of this obscure part, and of the opposite islands, will be delivered in a future volume of this work.</P>

<ITEM>Argus, iv. 710. This is a magnificent species found in <HI>China.</HI> Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> has given two figures of this rare bird, one in the Phil. Trans. vol. lv. p. 88. and the other never published, of which he presented me with several. It is of the size of a large turkey-cock; the middle tail seathers are two feet long: the primary feathers of the wings very broad, and one web most attractively ocellated. The history is unknown. Its residence is in the north of <HI>China</HI> and in <HI>Korea.</HI> There is in the <HI>Chinese</HI> empire, a bird, whether of this genus I will not determine, with some of the tail feathers six feet and one inch long, and an inch and a half broad; colors white, edged with dull buff; webs as if serrated on each side of the shaft with black upon the white ground. The bird is said to have been in
<PB N="196" REF="210"/>body no larger than a pigeon. One of the kind died on board the ship in 1781, in its passage from <HI>China.</HI> Colo∣nel <HI>Davies,</HI> of the artillery, made an accurate drawing from the feather itself, and favored me with a sight of his per∣formance.</ITEM>

Is not uncommon in the <HI>British</HI> menageries, and hardy enough to bear our climate in a state of liberty, if the brilliancy of its colors did not make it the mark of our poachers, and quickly bring on its extirpation. It breeds readily in confinement; its eggs are redder than those of the common pheasant. These birds are called in <HI>China, Kin-ki,</HI> or <HI>Golden hens.</HI> They are found in the provinces of <HI>Yunan, Se-chwen,</HI> and <HI>Shen-si;</HI> its flesh is more delicate than the common kind.</ITEM>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">ISLES OF LIQUEJO.</NOTE> are the next; they are seventy leagues to the north-east of <HI>For∣mosa;</HI> the most considerable, <HI>Kintschin,</HI> which lies north and south, between Latitudes 26° 28′, and 25° 45′, is about fifty leagues long, and fifteen broad: the east side and south end skirted by num∣bers of little isles and rocks; the inhabitants are chiefly <HI>Chinese,</HI> who fled from the <HI>Tartars</HI> at the time of the last revolution. They were well received by the natives, who speak a broken
<PB N="210" REF="222"/><HI>Chinese,</HI> which argues their descent, so that the new comers were considered as countrymen. They are principally husbandmen and fishermen, and are a most cheerful happy people, diverting themselves, after the labor of the day, with a glass of rice beer, and with their musical instruments, which they take into the field with them. A few centuries ago, these islands were conquered by a prince of <HI>Satzuma,</HI> a province of <HI>Japan,</HI> who governed them by his lieutenants; they still remain in the same state of dependence, but are taxed with much gentleness. The inhabi∣tants also send annually to the emperor of <HI>China,</HI> a gift in token of loyalty and submission. They carry on a commerce with <HI>Satzuma,</HI> and visit it once a year; they have there a company of merchants, but are confined in their commerce to that port, and limited to the value of their trade, but by the connivance of the <HI>Japanese</HI> officers, they dispose of an infinitely greater quantity than the law admits. They import into <HI>Satzuma</HI> all kinds of silks and stuffs, and various <HI>Chinese</HI> commodities, which they carry over in their own jonks, and some of their own produce, such as corn, rice, fruit, and pulse, and a sort of brandy made from the remainder of their crops. They bring great quantities of the <HI>Cypraeae Monetae,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">CYPRAEAE MONETAE.</NOTE> or cowries, the same species which is found in the <HI>Maldive</HI> isles
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Outlines of the Globe, vol. i. p. 151.</NOTE>; from those shells is also prepared a white varnish, with which the boys and girls paint their cheeks; they besides export a sort of large flat shells, which when po∣lished, are almost transparent, and serve the <HI>Japanese</HI> for glass in their windows; to these add some articles of luxury, in various scarce flowers and plants brought in pots, and a few other mat∣ters of a trifling nature. Notwithstanding these people are really
<PB N="211" REF="223"/>subject to the <HI>Japanese,</HI> they do not allow the emperor's su∣premacy, yet, like them, they have a <HI>Dairi</HI> or hereditary ecclesi∣astical governor, to whom they pay great respect, and suppose to be lineally descended from the gods of their country; he resides at the isle called by <HI>Kaempfer</HI>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">TANAASIMA ISLAND.</NOTE> with several lesser, extend north and south to the north-east of the <HI>Liquejo</HI> islands, and form the links between them and <HI>Japan.</HI> Between the isle of <HI>Tanaasima,</HI> and that of <HI>Liquejo,</HI> are the streights of <HI>Van Diemen;</HI> that island is the most southern of those which compose the great empire of JAPAN. and is the smallest of the number; the latitude of the south end is 30° north, according to Doctor <HI>Thunberg,</HI> and the most northerly of the <HI>Japanese</HI> islands extends to 40°, the longitude from 143° to 161° east. The coasts are rude and rocky; the circumambient seas, raging with storms during nine months of the year,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">STORMY.</NOTE> are shallow, filled with shoals and rocks, and extremely subject to frequent shipwrecks. Off this coast are two whirlpools, dan∣gerous, and not less tremendous than those of the famous <HI>Mael∣strom</HI> near the <HI>Norwegian</HI> shores; there are frequent instances of ships being absorbed in the vortex, and their shattered fragments slung up at the distance of many leagues. The poets of <HI>Japan</HI> make constant allusions to these horrible phaenomena.</P>
<P>THE climate of the <HI>Japanese</HI> isles, like that of <HI>Great Britain,</HI>
<PB N="212" REF="224"/>is very changeable, and subject to frequent rains, fertilizing the ground, as they do that of our island. Thunder is frequent, and earthquakes so common, as never to be minded, unless attended (as has been often the case) with dreadful consquences.</P>
<P>THE summer heat is very great,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">HEAT.</NOTE> and scarcely tolerable, when not alleviated by the winds; it sometimes, in <HI>July</HI> and <HI>August,</HI> raises <HI>Fahrenheit</HI>'s thermometer to 100°. The cold on the contrary is excessive, and sinks the mercury many degrees below the freezing point, especially when the winds blow from the north and the east; in the northern parts there are mountains scarcely ever free from snow.</P>
<P>THE whole empire is mountanous,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">SOIL.</NOTE> level meadows are un∣known; the fields of the vallies consist of a clayey soil, sometimes sandy, yet rendered fertile by the incredible industry of the in∣habitants; even the higher hills are cultivated to the very tops.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">TEA.</NOTE> 817. <HI>Kaempfer</HI>'s Travels, i. 115. ii. appendix, 2. tab. 38, 39. The tea cultivated in <HI>Japan</HI> is the <HI>Bohea,</HI> the <HI>Tsjaa</HI> of the <HI>Japanese,</HI> the <HI>Theh</HI> of the <HI>Chinese.</HI> The origin of it has its legend equal to any in the universe. <HI>Darma,</HI> the son of an <HI>Indian</HI> king, who flourished about the year 519 of the <HI>Christian</HI> era, arrived in <HI>China</HI> to preach his doctrine to the inhabitants. It seems he was a sort of pope in <HI>India,</HI> the twenty-eighth in succession from the founder of eastern paganism. He had vowed the greatest au∣sterities, particularly a perpetual watchfulness; nature, worn out, was obliged at length to submit to the refreshment of sleep; on finishing his slumbers, he cut off both his eye-brows, which had dared to close, and flinging them on the ground, each became a shrub; <HI>Darma</HI> eat some of the leaves, and to his great surprise, found himself invigorated, so as to undergo any labors or any watchings; he communicated the virtues to his disciples, and tea became of universal use. It is therefore styled by some the eye-brows of <HI>Darma;</HI> he is represented as a horrid ugly fellow, with vast eye-brows, wrapped in a great cloak, and standing on a reed, on which he had been wafted from region to region.</P>
<P>WE may be certain from this tale, that the tea plant was abo∣riginal of <HI>China.</HI> It is cultivated by sowing, not in whole fields, but round the borders in rows, so that it may not hurt the land; good farmers manure the plants with human ordure. In seven
<PB N="216" REF="228"/>years time it grows to the height of a man; its few leaves, at that time are gathered, the shrub cut down, and the most plentiful harvest is obtained from the vigorous shoots of the succeeding years.</P>
<P>THE leaves are gathered by laborers, peculiarly brought up to the business; they must not be taken by handfuls, but pulled off one by one. The trees are not stripped entirely, for there are three gatherings in the year. The leaves are sorted into three parcels; the finest, the small, tender, primaeval shoots, are re∣served for princes and great men, and on that account called imperial. They are next prepared by drying over the fire in an iron pan, and after that rolled with the palm of the hand on a mat, in order to fold them. Public laboratories are built for the purpose. All the processes are given at large by <HI>Kaempfer</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See also Staunton's Embassy to <HI>China,</HI> vol. ii. p. 464.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>TEA is in as universal use in <HI>Japan</HI> as in <HI>China,</HI> and taken two ways. The most common is similar to the <HI>European,</HI> or ra∣ther the mode we learned from the <HI>Orientalists;</HI> but the manner of taking it is attended with the utmost ceremony. The art is called <HI>Sado</HI> and <HI>Tsianoi.</HI> We have our dancing-masters, &amp;c. and in my time M. <HI>Vestris</HI> gave lectures to our quality on the manner of eating gracefully their soup. The <HI>Japanese</HI> masters are to in∣struct in the manner of behavior at tea, how they are to make it, and how they are to present it in a polite manner.</P>
<P>THE qualities of tea are as much disputed in <HI>Japan</HI> as they are in <HI>Europe;</HI> but such is the charming infatuation, that the use is still followed in defiance of those who take the side of de∣pretiation in the old controversy. <HI>Kaempfer</HI> gives us an excel∣lent figure of the plant, in vol. ii. tab. 38, and of the process of
<PB N="217" REF="229"/>the tea-table, and all its apparatus, in tab. 39, and of the tea∣cup; nor is the representation of its great founder <HI>Darma,</HI> for∣gotten, with his vast over-hanging eye-brows.</P>

<P><PB N="225" REF="237"/><HI>Arundo bambos,</HI> 54. Sp. pl. 1. p. 227. <HI>Flor. Coch.</HI> 70. I am obliged to my friend the reverend Mr. <HI>Dickinson,</HI> for the follow∣ing curious account of the <HI>Arundo Bambos,</HI> "which" says he,
<Q>grows in the woods and mountains of <HI>Japan,</HI> and produces many varieties, differing much in habit, and distinguished by different names. Yet, amidst all this variety, <HI>Thunberg</HI> ob∣serves that he never had the satisfaction of meeting with a single plant of it in the flowering state. This is not to be wondered at, when we are informed by <HI>Reede,</HI> Mal. v. i. p. 25. that it does not flower till it has attained the age of about sixty years, and what is very remarkable, sheds its leaves a month previous to the time of flowering, and immediately after having perfected its fruit, withers and dies.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The small slender walking canes, so much admired for their elegant rings, are obtained from young irregular suckers or shoots of the bambo, which spring from the root, after the main stem has been repeatedly cut down. Nature has not formed them precisely of the figure in which we receive them. They are originally crooked and pliant, and much art is used, by suspended weights attached to them, and the application of smoke, to render them strait and stiff. It is farther necessary to retrench with a knife the fibres which adhere to the rings, and were intended by nature to propagate the plant, in the same manner as the <HI>Triticum repens</HI> (couch grass) multiplies its offsets by shoots from the joints.</Q></P>
<P><Q>This species of walking stick is distinguished from the <HI>Rotang,</HI> or true cane, not only by its singular protuberances, but also by a small perforation extending through the center
<PB N="226" REF="238"/>of the whole length of it, which is common to all <HI>Bambus,</HI> and in their mature state enlarges into spacious cavities, ren∣dering this inestimable vegetable subservient to a thousand useful domestic purposes. It is only in the island of <HI>Japan</HI> that the <HI>Bambu</HI> is thus artificially prepared for the purpose of a walking cane: and constituting a lucrative article of com∣merce, it is counterfeited at <HI>Surat</HI> (upon the <HI>Malabar</HI> coast) and a spurious sort made of a different wood imposed upon the ignorant. The name of <HI>Bambu</HI> is not <HI>Indian,</HI> but was given to this plant by <HI>Europeans,</HI> as expressive of the violent ex∣plosion that comes upon committing its branches to the flames, the report of which is said to equal that of the firing of guns, and is caused by the rarefaction of great quantities of air, which had been imprisoned in its numerous chambers. See an accurate description of the <HI>Japan</HI> walking-stick with por∣tuberant joints, <HI>Rumph. Amb.</HI> vol. iv. lib. 6. p. 18. sect. the last. The minute perforation of the young shoots of the <HI>Bambu</HI> is noticed by <HI>Rheede, Hort. mal.</HI> v. 2. p. 25. sect. 3. '<HI>Stipites qui ex radice,</HI> &amp;c.' So high a sense had the <HI>Indians</HI> in antient times of the multifarious benefits and blessings of this vegetable, that they actually made it an object of divine wor∣ship, particularly in the island of <HI>Amboina, Rumph.</HI> v. iv. p. 18. sect. 3. <HI>Ob multiplicia arundinum,</HI> &amp;c.</Q> Let me add, that of the germs which spring from the root is made the fine pickle called <HI>Atsjaar,</HI> they are macerated in salt and vinegar, with leeks, and <HI>capsicum</HI> pods added.</P>

<P><HI>Japan</HI> is rich in minerals.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">GOLD.</NOTE> Gold is found in various parts of the island, sometimes in grains washed out of the sand; in other places it is extracted by fusion, from its matrix, or the ores of copper. All the mines of this metal are claimed by the emperor, and none dare work without his permission; when this is obtained, two thirds of the produce are the portion of the emperor, the pro∣prietor of the land receives one third for his expences.</P>
<P>SILVER mines abound. Copper is the most common of all the metals,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">SILVER. COPPER.</NOTE> and the greatest article of commerce with the <HI>Dutch</HI> factors. All the ore is melted at <HI>Saccai</HI> or <HI>Osacca,</HI> and there only, where it is cast into cylinders, about a span and a half long, and a finger thick. The finest ore is dug at <HI>Seruga,</HI> from which the <HI>Japanese</HI> separate and refine a quantity of gold. The coin of <HI>Japan</HI> is made either of gold, silver, or copper;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">COINS.</NOTE> those of the two former are generally of an oblong shape, rounded at the ends, and inscribed with letters, and the arms of the mint mas∣ter, or the emperor, or <HI>Dairo.</HI> The form of the coins is given by <HI>Kaempfer,</HI> i. tab. 19. and by <HI>Tavernier,</HI> part ii. p. 9. tab. 9. p. 10. tab. 10.; in the last, the silver coins are irregular at their edges.

<P>THE <HI>Japanese</HI> speak of two islands
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Kaempfer, i. 68.</NOTE> one named <HI>Ginsima</HI> or the <HI>silver,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">GOLD AND SILVER ISLES.</NOTE> the other <HI>Kinsima</HI> or the <HI>golden.</HI> Their situation is kept very secret; but <HI>Philip</HI> III. having heard of them, and in∣stigated by avarice, sent a ship with a skilful pilot to find them out. The <HI>Dutch,</HI> urged by the same passion as the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> made two attempts to discover them, one in 1639, the other in 1643, but both were fruitless. They are said to lie to the E. N. E. of the coasts of <HI>Japan,</HI> a hundred and fifty miles distant. All that I can find is, that they are both put down in Mr. <HI>Arrow∣smith</HI>'s map; one in about Lat. 30° north, under the name of <HI>Rica di oro</HI> or the <HI>gold</HI> island, and the other <HI>Rica di plata</HI> or the <HI>silver,</HI> still farther north. Mr. <HI>Arrowsmith</HI> supposes it to be that stupendous rock called <HI>Lot's Wife,</HI> a pyramid three hundred and fifty feet high, admirably described and depicted by Mr. <HI>Meares,</HI> in p. 97 of his voyage.
<Q>The Lat. says he, was 29° 50′ north, the Longitude 142° 23′ cast of <HI>Greenwich.</HI> The waves broke against its rugged front with a fury proportioned to the im∣mense distance they had to roll before they were interrupted by it. It rose almost perpendicular to the height, according to the tables, of near three hundred and fifty feet. A small black rock appeared just above the water, at about forty or fifty yards from the western edge. There was a cavern on
<PB N="245" REF="257"/>its south eastern side, into which the waters rolled with an awful and tremendous noise. In regarding this stupendous rock, which stood alone in an immense ocean, we could not but con∣sider it as an object which had been able to resist one of those great convulsions of nature, that change the very form of those parts of the globe which they are permitted to desolate.</Q></P>
<P>SOME
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Kaempfer, i. 109.</NOTE> tin is found in <HI>Japan</HI> of exquisite fineness,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">TIN.</NOTE> almost equal to silver, but it is a metal very little used.</P>
<P>IRON abounds in the <HI>Japanese</HI> empire;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">IRON.</NOTE> that likewise is fused into cylindrical forms; it is as dear as copper; most sorts of in∣struments are composed of that metal and of brass; but they are wise enough to make their culinary vessels of a composition of iron.</P>
<P>COALS abound in <HI>Japan,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">COALS.</NOTE> but notwithstanding the severity of the weather in winter, the inhabitants chiefly use charcoal, placed on ashes in a great pot, so prepared as to prevent any noxious effect from the fumes.</P>
<P>THAT useful article, salt, is made from the sea-water,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">SALT.</NOTE> filtrated through sand, and then boiled to a proper consistence, and cal∣cined in earthen pots.</P>
<P><HI>Naptha</HI> is frequent in one part of <HI>Japan.</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">NAPTHA.</NOTE> The natives collect and burn it in their lamps instead of oil.</P>
<P><HI>Sulphur</HI> abounds in an island called <HI>Iwogasima</HI> or <HI>Sulphur isle,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">SULPHUR.</NOTE> near the province of <HI>Satzuma. Kaempfer</HI> gives a curious ac∣count of the place.
<Q>It is, says he, not above a hundred years since they first ventured thither. It was thought before that time to be wholly inaccessible, and by reason of the thick
<PB N="246" REF="258"/>smoke which was observed continually to arise from it, and of the several spectres, and other frightful uncommon appa∣ritions, people fancied to see there in the night, it was believed to be a dwelling-place of devils, till at last a resolute and cou∣rageous man offered himself, and obtained leave accordingly to go and examine the state and situation of it. He chose fifty resolute fellows for this expedition, who upon going on shore found neither hell nor devils, but a large flat spot of ground at the top, which was so thoroughly covered with sulphur, that wherever they walked a thick smoke issued from under their feet. Ever since that time this island brings in to the prince of <HI>Satzuma</HI> about 20 chests of silver <HI>per annum,</HI> arising only from the sulphur dug up there, besides what he gets by the trees and timber growing along the shore.</Q></P>
<P>VULCANOES are to be found in many parts of the empire,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">VULCANOES.</NOTE> which in general abounds with their great <HI>pabulum, sulphur</HI> and metallic bodies. Some have burnt incessantly for ages; others have ceased, or only emit flames periodically. The most noted is the mountain <HI>Fesi,</HI> in the province of <HI>Surugu,</HI> equal in height to the pike of <HI>Teneriff,</HI> and capt with everlasting snow.</P>
<P>No country is more subject to earthquakes than <HI>Japan;</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">EARTHQUAKES.</NOTE> so frequent are they, that the natives regard them with as little terror as a <HI>European</HI> would a storm; yet no annals can produce such tragical relations of their sad effects. That in 1586, told by Father <HI>de Frocs,</HI> preserved by <HI>Kaempfer,</HI> is one, but dreadfully surpassed by the earthquake of 1704, when the whole city of <HI>Jeddo</HI> was destroyed, and two hundred thousand of its inhabi∣tants perished in the ruins.</P>
<P><PB N="247" REF="259"/>IN many places are springs of water most intensely hot;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">HOT SPRINGS.</NOTE> some boil up with such violence as to fling up the largest stones which are laid over them; we are not told to what height. They are said to be periodical, so I suspect them to be of the same nature with the <HI>Geysers</HI> of <HI>Iceland.</HI> Those of a gentler heat are used as baths for several disorders. Those of the boiling heat were for∣merly applied (as I shall have occasion to mention) for the most cruel purposes.</P>
<P>THE empire of <HI>Japan</HI> consists of three greater islands;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">NIPON.</NOTE> the largest, <HI>Nipon,</HI> which gives name to the whole, is of a curvated form, and approximates at the southern end to the south-western extremity of <HI>Korea.</HI> Between both are the streights of <HI>Korea,</HI> and within is the great gulph of the same name, bounded on the eastern side by the concavity of <HI>Nipon.</HI> According to M. <HI>D'Anvilles</HI> scale, that island is above six hundred miles in length.</P>
<P>THE next island is that of <HI>Sikokf,</HI> or the country of <HI>four,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">SIKOKF.</NOTE> be∣cause divided into four provinces. It is irregular in its form, and lodged between two large projections of <HI>Nipon;</HI> its length is two hundred miles.</P>
<P>BETWEEN its eastern end and the west of the salient part of <HI>Nipon,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">AWAD.</NOTE> is a smaller island named <HI>Awad.</HI></P>
<P>THE third, or more southerly island, is separated from the western part of <HI>Sikokf</HI> by a narrow strait, and is named <HI>Saikokf,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">SAIKOKF OR KIUSIU.</NOTE> or the western country, and <HI>Kiusiu,</HI> or the country of <HI>nine,</HI> be∣cause divided into nine provinces.</P>
<P>AROUND most of these greater islands are innumerable small ones, inhabited or uninhabited; among them <HI>Firando</HI> and <HI>Gesima</HI>
<PB N="248" REF="260"/>are the most celebrated, as having been the seat of <HI>European</HI> factories, and distinguished in history.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Japanese</HI> islands were certainly visited,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">VISITED BY MARCO POLO.</NOTE> in the thirteenth century, by the famous <HI>Marco Polo.</HI> He describes the riches of the country in high terms, and says that the emperor's palace was covered with plates of gold, and that the seas abounded with fine pearls of a red cast. He adds, that the inhabitants were idolaters, and worshipped monstrous images with the heads of beasts, and with many hands; and that if they took any foreigner who was able to ransom himself, they let him go; otherwise they killed him, and with their friends made a feast on his body.</P>
<P><HI>Marco Polo</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Travels, p. 125, 126.</NOTE> gives a long account of the imprudent invasion of this island by the great <HI>Tartarian</HI> emperor <HI>Kublai Khan</HI> (the <HI>Siu Tsu</HI> of the <HI>Chinese</HI>
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Du Halde, i. 214.</NOTE>) about the year 1281, who sent there his general, <HI>Argas,</HI> with a most numerous army and vast fleet. The greater part of his ships perished in a tempest, and all the men who escaped to shore were massacred by the <HI>Japanese,</HI> so that very few returned to give any account of the misfortune. The <HI>Chinese</HI> never more attempted the empire of <HI>Japan.</HI></P>
<P>THAT country cannot properly be said to have been discovered by the <HI>Europeans</HI> till the year 1542,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">DISCOVERED BY THE POR∣TUGUESE.</NOTE> by three <HI>Portuguese,</HI> named <HI>de Mota, Zeimoto,</HI> and <HI>Peixolo;</HI> these, as I have before mentioned, in common with the rest of their countrymen, instigated by avarice, had sailed from <HI>Malacca</HI> in search of an imaginary spot, called the <HI>island of gold.</HI> Driven by a hurricane, they were wrecked on the shores of <HI>Japan:</HI> The lord of the district re∣ceived
<PB N="249" REF="261"/>them with great humanity, and signified an earnest de∣sire of entering into a commerce with a nation which he flattered himself would be so advantageous to him and his subjects.</P>
<P>IT was at this period that <HI>Francis de Xavier,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">FRANCIS DE XAVIER,</NOTE> the great apostle of the <HI>Indies,</HI> was deeply engaged in his mission in the peninsula of <HI>Malacca.</HI> His fame had reached <HI>Japan,</HI> when a native of the country determined to make a visit to that part of <HI>India,</HI> to be satisfied of the truth of the wonders reported to have been wrought by <HI>de Xavier.</HI> He came, attended by two servants, was converted to Christianity, and adopted the name of <HI>Paul</HI> of the <HI>Holy Faith;</HI> so zealous was he in his new religion, that he may truly be called the <HI>Apostle</HI> of <HI>Japan. De Xavier</HI> determined to attend him to his native country. He associated with him two Jesuits, sailed and landed in 1551 at <HI>Kangoxima,</HI> in the kingdom of <HI>Satzuma,</HI> on the southern part of the island of <HI>Kiusiu,</HI> and soon after passed to <HI>Firando,</HI> a small island, where he, assisted by <HI>Paul,</HI> made converts innumerable.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">INTRODUCES CHRISTIANITY.</NOTE> His zeal then determined him to visit the emperor, at the royal city of <HI>Miaco;</HI> he arrived at the court, and was received with much respect. The mul∣titude of proselytes was incredible. The benevolence and hu∣manity of our religion were the principal instruments with which the missionaries operated on the minds of the people, who compared the conduct of the Christian preachers with that of their own <HI>Bonzees.</HI> The last suppose that all sick and infirm people are the objects of the wrath of Heaven, and constantly leave them to perish. The missionaries observed the precepts of our Saviour; they fed the hungry, cloathed the naked, and administered to the sick. These irresistible proofs of the superior
<PB N="250" REF="262"/>excellency of our doctrine, gave success to their labours; for near a century the true religion flourished, and spread more and more over the empire. Other circumstances concurred to fa∣cilitate the reception of the gospel in <HI>Japan.</HI> The <HI>Bonzees</HI> preached the necessity of mediators in their <HI>Xaca</HI> and other gods; they underwent long and severe fasts and mortifications, and both Christians and <HI>Japanese</HI> agreed in the worshipping of images, in the monastic life, in beads, processions, praying for the dead, and even auricular confession.</P>
<P>The <HI>Jesuits</HI> were followed,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">JESUITS, &amp;c.</NOTE> as occurred in <HI>China,</HI> by crowds of <HI>Dominicans, Franciscans,</HI> and <HI>Augustlines</HI> to assist in the harvest. The holy men soon fell into the same error as in that empire; they quickly began to quarrel with the Jesuits, accused them of avarice, and of temporizing with the vices and superstitions of the <HI>Japanese.</HI> Let the reader peruse p. 98 of this volume, and he will learn the imprudency of all these religious adventurers.</P>
<P>THE vast profits resulting from the commercial and worldly spirit of the Jesuits, were one cause of the toleration which the Christian religion experienced for so great a length of time. The emperors saw the wealth the <HI>Europeans</HI> brought into their country; and as long as the Christians did not disturb the peace of the government, they permitted the conversion of their sub∣jects, and the exercise of our religion. The <HI>Portuguese</HI> settled at first at the harbors of <HI>Bungo</HI> and <HI>Firando,</HI> and afterwards at <HI>Nagasaki</HI> only. They carried on immense trade; and in one year exported not less than three hundred tons of gold from <HI>Miaco,</HI> the emporium, at that time, of all their commerce in this part of the world. In the year 1636, when their trade was on
<PB N="251" REF="263"/>the decline, they even sent from that town 2350 chests of silver.</P>
<P>The <HI>Dutch</HI> introduced themselves into <HI>Japan</HI> about the year 1600, established their first factory at <HI>Firando,</HI> and obtained from the emperor a patent for a free commerce. The deep enmity between them and the <HI>Portuguese</HI> soon began to shew itself, and each nation took every possible means to supplant its rival. In the year 1636 an opportunity offered.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">CONSPIRACY.</NOTE> The <HI>Dutch</HI> happened to take a <HI>Portuguese</HI> ship, in which were found certain letters from a captain <HI>Moro</HI> to the <HI>Portuguese</HI> ministry at <HI>Lisbon,</HI> wherein he had laid a plan for murdering the emperor, and reducing the empire to the power of his countrymen. <HI>Moro</HI> was a <HI>Japanese</HI> by birth, chief of the <HI>Portuguese</HI> in <HI>Japan,</HI> and very zealous for the Christian religion. The letters were carefully transmitted to the emperor. <HI>Moro</HI> was empaled, and burnt alive. After a little time an edict followed, which entirely banished every foreigner from the empire, with the most rigid prohibition of their ever entering it again. A persecution was raised against the Christians,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">PERSECUTION.</NOTE> perhaps the most horrid that ever was known; it lasted forty years, and thousands perished by the most dreadful torments; it was computed that above a third of the people of the empire were professors of Christianity. The punishments those mi∣serable creatures underwent are not to be related, the inventions of Hell itself must have been put to the stretch. If any one has the strange curiosity of being acquainted with them, he need only turn to <HI>Ogilvy</HI>'s History of <HI>Japan</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 253.</NOTE>, which he will probably shut with the same horror as I did. Let me only add, that the
<PB N="252" REF="264"/>boiling water mentioned by me at p. 247 of this work, was one of the instruments of torture, varied and lengthened by the most diabolical inventions. Those of <HI>Singok</HI> were the most horrible; they flow with vast violence and noise beneath a lofty precipice, and emit the most noisome sulphureous vapor, which rises to a great height. Hither the Christians were brought in multitudes; and in case they refused to renounce their religion, were carried bound to the summit of the mountain, and precipitated into the subjacent <HI>Phlegethon.</HI></P>
<P>IN order to impress on every subject a detestation of the <HI>Christian</HI> religion,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">TREADING ON THE CRUCIFIX.</NOTE> and possibly to discover if there be any latent favorers of its doctrine, the following annual custom is preserved throughout the empire: people of all ranks and periods of life, even to children of a certain age, are assembled in the different places, where they perform the ceremony of trampling upon the cross. It was even said to have been a rite exacted from the <HI>Dutch,</HI> as the price of their commerce with the <HI>Japanese. Swift,</HI> in his voyage to <HI>Laputa,</HI> is humorous on the subject; for when <HI>Gulliver,</HI> under the character of a <HI>Dutchman,</HI> petitions the em∣peror to be excused the ceremony, his majesty, much surprised, tells him, that he was the first of his countrymen who ever made any scruple, and that he suspected he must be a Christian, and not a <HI>Hollander.</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">DUTCH.</NOTE> In 1611 the <HI>Dutch</HI> sent a solemn embassy to the emperor, then resident at <HI>Miaco,</HI> and were said to have at that time obtained an advantageous commercial treaty; at length they fell under the general edict of expulsion; yet even after that severe decree, procured re-admission, under most mortify∣ing restrictions; they virtually are compelled to renounce their
<PB N="253" REF="265"/>religion; they must give up their prayer-books on first land∣ing, and relinquish during their whole confinement every mark of Christianity. But what will not a <HI>Dutchman</HI> do for gain! They make from the factory an annual journey to the em∣peror's court, which they dignify with the name of embassy; but it is no more than a compulsory visit to present their gifts: their manner of travelling, both on their way and on their re∣turn, is under a strict guard, more like that of a parcel of con∣victs, than the merchants of a great commercial nation. One ship only is permitted to trade with this empire annually, and that is confined to the port of <HI>Nagasaki,</HI> in the little isle of <HI>De∣sima,</HI> on the west side of the island <HI>Kiusiu.</HI> In fact, this is the only secure harbor in all the mighty empire of <HI>Japan.</HI> As soon as a vessel arrives, a <HI>Japanese</HI> guard is put on board; the number, size, age, and complexion of the crew noted down; every living creature in the vessel is to be accounted for; a monkey died, and the coroner's inquest sat on the body. The next thing done is to take an exact inventory of, and to cause all the sails, masts, ropes, rudder, guns, arms, ammunition, &amp;c. and all the tackle of the ships, to be conveyed into the emperor's warehouse, there to be kept under lock and seal till the time comes for their departure, when they are restored, according to the inventory taken, of which both parties have an exact duplicate
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Some of these precautions, <HI>Thunberg</HI> says, are now omitted. E.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE factory is imprisoned in the little island the whole year,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">FACTORY.</NOTE> excepting during the six weeks of open trade, when the <HI>Ja∣panese</HI> come there with their goods, erect booths, and have all
<PB N="254" REF="266"/>sorts of amusements.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">SMUGGLING.</NOTE> Smuggling, even of the most trifling ar∣ticles, is forbidden under pain of death; <HI>Kaempfer</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">History of <HI>Japan,</HI> i. 330.</NOTE> assures us, that three hundred were executed for that crime only in six or seven years time; two were put to death while he was in the island, and the factory obliged to attend; their crime was no more than smuggling one pound of camplior.</P>
<P>THE articles imported by the <HI>Dutch,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">TRADE. IMPORTS.</NOTE> are raw silk from <HI>China, Tonquin, Bengal,</HI> and <HI>Persia;</HI> and from the same countries all kinds of stuffs, silks, and woollens, provided they are not wrought with gold or silver; various sorts of the cotton manufactures of <HI>India,</HI> but not painted; woollen cloths, stuffs, and serges from <HI>Europe;</HI> buffalo and deer hides from <HI>Siam</HI> and <HI>Cambodia;</HI> tanned hides from <HI>Persia</HI> and <HI>Bengal;</HI> pepper, sugar, cloves, and nut∣megs from <HI>India,</HI> or the spicy isles; <HI>gum-lac,</HI> sandal-wood, cam∣phor, from <HI>Borneo; Catechu, Storax Liquida,</HI> saffron and <HI>Costus,</HI> coral, cinnabar, antimony, lead, saltpetre, and borax, looking glasses, which the <HI>Japanese</HI> break to make spying glasses, mag∣nifiers, &amp;c. files, needles, and various sorts of iron ware, from <HI>Europe;</HI> large drinking glasses, spectacles, toys, curiosities na∣tural and artificial, and strange birds of all kinds. Once the <HI>Dutch</HI> brought a <HI>Cassowary;</HI> it was considered as a bird of ill omen, and the owner was obliged to send it back.</P>
<P>IN return the <HI>Dutch</HI> obtain,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">EXPORTS.</NOTE> during the six weeks fair, gold, silver, and copper bullion, japanned cabinet and other works, por∣celain, tea, and <HI>Japanese</HI> camphor, and also copper in bars, and other forms. These constitute the sum of the traffic, which on the whole is far from considerable, ever since the abolition of
<PB N="255" REF="267"/>Christianity in the empire. The <HI>Abbe Raynal</HI> estimates the whole annual commerce at little more than forty-five thousand pounds.</P>
<P>THE first time that the <HI>English</HI> traded directly with <HI>Japan,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">ENGLISH.</NOTE> was in 1613, when captain <HI>Saris</HI> entered the port of <HI>Firando;</HI> he met with the most courteous reception from the king of the island. <HI>Saris</HI> was charged with letters and presents from our commercial pacific monarch <HI>James</HI> I. to his imperial majesty of <HI>Japan.</HI> After a short stay at <HI>Firando,</HI> he proceeded on his journey to <HI>Surunga,</HI> where the emperor at that time kept his court. A most honorable answer was returned, and privilege of trade granted to the <HI>English</HI> throughout the <HI>Japanese</HI> empire; <HI>Saris</HI> then made a visit to the emperor's son at <HI>Jedo.</HI> The history of these transactions is given by <HI>Purchas</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pilgrim, vol. i. p. 366-377.</NOTE>, and is well worth con∣sulting. <HI>Saris</HI> found at <HI>Firando, William Adams,</HI> an <HI>Englishman,</HI> who by a strange chance was flung on this island, and detained there
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid, p. 125-132.</NOTE> till his death. He was of no small use to <HI>Saris</HI> as an inter∣preter. <HI>Saris</HI> established a factory at <HI>Firando,</HI> till the general ex∣pulsion of the <HI>Europeans,</HI> the <HI>Dutch</HI> excepted.</P>
<P>THE <HI>French,</HI> in the time of <HI>Colbert,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">FRENCH.</NOTE> were desirous of partaking of the advantages of the <HI>Japanese</HI> trade; that great minister proposed sending a number of <HI>Huguenots,</HI> who might safely swear that they were not of the same religion with the <HI>Portu∣guese;</HI> but the jealous <HI>Japanese</HI> rejected the request.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Chinese</HI> had once prodigious commerce in this empire,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHINESE.</NOTE> and came and settled in any numbers they pleased; but in time
<PB N="256" REF="268"/>the jealous <HI>Japanese</HI> took umbrage at the vast concourse of those foreigners, and at length confined them to a certain precinct, near the same island with the <HI>Dutch.</HI> They are allowed to have three sales in the year, one in spring, when they are permitted to dis∣pose of the cargoes of twenty jonks, a second of thirty jonks, and a third in autumn of twenty. All above the number are obliged to return without being suffered to unlade.</P>
<P>THE religion of the <HI>Japanese</HI> is idolatry:
<NOTE PLACE="marg">THEIR DEITIES.</NOTE> their deities are amaz∣ingly numerous; tradition says that they had been men eminent for their piety or mortification, deified after death for their se∣veral virtues. They also hold that their earliest emperors were gods and demi-gods, and that during the first period, they were governed by seven great celestial spirits, each of which reigned a certain, but immense number of years. Their temples are very numerous, dispersed not only over the cities, but even the moun∣tains and deserts. Their idols assume a thousand extravagant forms, and colossal sizes; in one of their temples is an idol of copper gilt, the very chair it sits on is seventy feet high, and the head so large as to be capable of containing fifteen men; many of them work miracles, and bring abundance of gain to the temple or monastery which possesses such a treasure.</P>
<P>A TEMPLE near <HI>Miaco</HI> takes its name from its number of idols, which amount to 33,333; Doctor <HI>Kaempfer</HI> gives us a view
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">History of <HI>Japan,</HI> vol. ii. tab. 36.</NOTE> of this vast repository, and in the following plate represents its celebrated idol <HI>Quenwoa,</HI> sitting on the flower <HI>Tarate.</HI></P>
<P>THE monastic life is much in vogue in <HI>Japan.</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">MONASTIC LIFE.</NOTE> The mona∣steries are filled with regulars and seculars, like those of the
<PB N="257" REF="269"/>church of <HI>Rome;</HI> some lead most austere lives; others indulge like the plump <HI>Benedictines;</HI> others are accused of great irregu∣larities.</P>
<P>THERE is one order of singular austerity, that of the <HI>Jamma∣bos,</HI> i. e. the <HI>mountain soldiers;</HI> they in one sense answer to our mi∣litary religious, being bound to fight for the gods and religion of their country, but never have degenerated into the voluptu∣ousness of the knights of the <HI>European</HI> orders. They pass their time amidst the holy mountains, and practise the greatest morti∣fications; the richer live more at their ease in their own houses. This order is now divided into two sects, one called <HI>Jofanfa,</HI> the votaries of which bind themselves to ascend once a year the great mountain of <HI>Fikoasan,</HI> a journey of vast difficulty, by reason of its heights and dreadful precipices, but still more tremendous on account of the penalty attending any impure per∣son making the attempt; he infallibly is possessed by the devil of the mountain, and becomes stark mad. The other sect is named <HI>Fonsansa;</HI> this likewise is obliged to make an annual pilgrimage to the summit of the <HI>Omine,</HI> a mountain not less terrible than the other; but should any one presume to ascend it without being duly prepared by purification, he is certain of being flung down the precipices, or seized with a lingering illness, the pe∣nalties of his neglect.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Japanese</HI> religion is split into a multitude of sects;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">VARIOUS SECTS.</NOTE> each differ in some tenets, yet all agree in five indispensible com∣mandments. 1. They are not to kill, or eat of any thing that is killed; 2. they are not to steal; 3. nor to lie; 4. nor to com∣mit adultery; 5. nor to drink wine. Is it not evident that they brought with them, on the dispersion of mankind, some of
<PB N="258" REF="270"/>the Mosaical laws, and in the last that they had adopted the rite of the <HI>Rechabites?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Japan</HI> has its peculiar language,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">LANGUAGE.</NOTE> different from all the <HI>Asiatic,</HI> and probably the primitive one, brought over by the colonists who originally peopled the islands, and came directly from the banks of the <HI>Euphrates,</HI> on the dispersion of mankind after the confusion of languages. The <HI>Japanese</HI> have an opinion that the primoeval emigrants settled in the province of <HI>Isje;</HI> numbers therefore make a pilgrimage annually to the antient spot, the place where their ancestors dwelt, and as such honor it with pe∣culiar acts of devotion. At <HI>Isje</HI> are two temples
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Kaempfer,</HI> i. tab. 17. 18.</NOTE>; within that which they name the <HI>True Temple,</HI> nothing is to be seen but a looking glass, and bits of white paper, emblems of truth and pu∣rity. They probably brought with them a pure Monotheism, which was afterwards converted into Polytheism, by their inter∣mixing with the several nations, which subsequently contributed to the population of <HI>Japan,</HI> because it is reasonably believed, that empire received a vast increase of inhabitants by the numerous shipwrecks on its stormy coasts, and likewise by migrations from the neighboring <HI>China</HI> and <HI>Korea.</HI> Whether the vast reverence which the <HI>Japanese</HI> pay to their parents was copied from the <HI>Chinese,</HI> or whether it might not have been introduced by the primoeval colonists, as a part of the first great code of laws, the fifth commandment, I will not pretend to determine.</P>
<P><HI>Japan</HI> is governed by two emperors;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">GOVERNMENT. SECULAR.</NOTE> one called the <HI>Cubo,</HI> or secular monarch, who rules with absolute power; all the princes and great lords of the empire pay him the most servile obedience.
<PB N="259" REF="271"/>Formerly the whole was divided into small independent states, the rulers were stiled kings and princes, many of which retain the names, and govern absolute enough; but entirely under the direction of the emperor.</P>
<P>THE antient title of the monarch was <HI>Dairo;</HI> he was also sovereign pontiff, and like the pope the supreme head of the church. In that character his person was held so sacred, that little short of divine worship was paid to him; for a long pe∣riod he governed by means of a prime minister, who was called the <HI>Cubo,</HI> a dignity usually bestowed on one of his younger sons; the father, like other eastern monarchs, devoting his whole time to indolence and sensuality. At length a <HI>Cubo</HI> arose, who de∣throned the <HI>Dairo,</HI> or rather usurped his more important office, that of secular emperor; he permitted him to retain that of pon∣tiff.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">ECCLESIAS∣TICAL.</NOTE> The <HI>Cubo</HI> thus stripped him of all sort of power except eccle∣siastical, but preserves the farce of paying him all external respect, as much as if he had enjoyed the antient plenitude of authority; he renders him an imaginary homage, and pretends to act only as his deputy, and to hold the empire from him.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Dairo</HI> was permitted to reside in the palace, in the old im∣perial city of <HI>Miaco,</HI> and to keep up the antient state, but that is now done with difficulty, as the <HI>Cubos</HI> have successively lessened the revenues. Still he reigns supreme over the church. The people pay him the utmost veneration, and the <HI>Cubo</HI> himself is obliged to marry one of his daughters, in case he has any that are marriageable. The first <HI>Cubo</HI> who usurped the empire, re∣tired to <HI>Jedo,</HI> which is the other great capital of the island.</P>
<P>THE laws of <HI>Japan,</HI> as is told of those of <HI>Draco,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">SEVERE LAWS,</NOTE> may be said
<PB N="260" REF="272"/>to have been written in blood. <HI>Montesquieu</HI> observes, that it is to supply the great defect of the religion of the country, in its ignorance of the doctrine of future rewards and punishment. Almost every crime is punished with death,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">AND PUNISH∣MENTS.</NOTE> and often attended with the most excruciating torments. Crucifixion is very com∣mon; sometimes the malefactor is crucified erect, sometimes with the head down. I have little doubt but that these punish∣ments were unknown in the empire, till the propagation of Christianity. The ideas were taken from the crucifixes of the Christians, and from the pictures of the suffering of our SAVIOR. The mode in which death was inflicted on the apostle St. <HI>Peter,</HI> probably gave rise to that variation of cruelty in <HI>Japan.</HI></P>
<P>THE punishment for gentlemen and soldiers is ripping open the belly. As a peculiar favor, they are sometimes permitted to be their own executioners. The emperor sends his mandate; the person whom he so favors, receives it with the utmost re∣spect; makes a great feast, and on the conclusion puts the im∣perial order in execution, in the very presence of his friends and family.</P>
<P>FROM the variety of feature and form of body in the <HI>Japanese</HI> of the several provinces, it is evident they are descended from different races of people, who have migrated, or have been cast on the coasts at various times. "Thus," says <HI>Kaempfer,</HI> i. 95.
<Q>although the <HI>Japanese</HI> in the main, particularly the common people of <HI>Nipon,</HI> be of a very ugly appearance, short-sized, strong, thick-legged, tawny, with flattish noses and thick eye∣lids (though the eyes stand not so deep in the forehead as in
<PB N="261" REF="273"/>the <HI>Chinese</HI>), yet the descendants of the eldest and noblest families, of the princes and lords of the empire, have some∣what more majestick in their shape and countenance, being more like the <HI>Europeans.</HI> The inhabitants of the provinces <HI>Satzuma, Oosijma,</HI> and <HI>Fiuga,</HI> are of a middle size, strong, courageous, and manly, otherwise civil and polite. The same is observed of the inhabitants of some of the northern pro∣vinces in the great island <HI>Nipon,</HI> excepting those of the great province <HI>Osju,</HI> who are said to be beyond others cruel and un∣merciful. The inhabitants of some provinces of <HI>Saikokf,</HI> par∣ticularly of <HI>Fisen,</HI> are short, slender, but well-shaped, of a good handsome appearance, and extremely polite. The inha∣bitants of the great island <HI>Nipon,</HI> particularly of its eastern provinces, are known from others by their big heads, flat noses, and musculous fleshy complexion.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Kaempfer</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hist. of <HI>Japan,</HI> i. 93.</NOTE> relates,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">ISLE OF BLACKS.</NOTE> that some centuries ago the <HI>Japanese</HI> dis∣covered the island of <HI>Genkaisima,</HI> situate to the north of <HI>Nipon,</HI> and inhabited by <HI>Owi,</HI> or <HI>black devils;</HI> and that after extirpating them, they peopled the isle with a colony of their own. These blacks are described in the antient chronicles of <HI>Japan</HI> to have worn long hair spread over their shoulders, and to have had strange household goods and high-crowned hats. <HI>Kaempfer</HI> justly imagines them to have been <HI>Malayes</HI> wrecked on that island. Those people are remarkable for wearing their hair of a great length; and as to the hats, they most probably were <HI>Eu∣ropean,</HI> and among the articles imported into the <HI>Malaye</HI> islands, which in old times were brought over land to <HI>Ormuz,</HI> and from
<PB N="262" REF="274"/>thence dispersed by sea to the peninsula of <HI>Malacca, Siam,</HI> and other places.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the <HI>Japanese</HI> have for ages scarcely known the pest of war,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">MANNERS.</NOTE> yet they are endowed with the greatest heroism. If in any quarrel they have been conquered by an enemy, and find they cannot revenge the insult, they will put themselves to death: I speak of this, not in praise, but to de∣scribe a high spirit, bordering on brutality. That spirit, exerted in a foreign land against the treachery of <HI>Peter Nuyts,</HI> the <HI>Dutch</HI> governor, merits our admiration and applause
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Univ. Hist. vol. x. p. 321. <HI>Kaempfer</HI>'s <HI>Japan,</HI> vol. ii. app. 57.</NOTE>. To fill the cata∣logue of their vices, they are distrustful, proud, cruel, and desti∣tute of benevolence; and from the doctrine of their <HI>Bonzees,</HI> are so insensible to the wants of their fellow-creatures, as to suffer them to perish by denying them every sort of relief. To their intrepidity may be added their patience under labor, their ability to undergo any hardships. Their other virtues are nume∣rous: they have great industry, great moderation in their plea∣sures, are entirely free from luxury and intemperance; mode∣rate in their desires of wealth, just in their dealings, and true to their word; chaste in word and action; religious, but apt to de∣viate into the grossest superstitions.</P>
<P>THEY are celebrated for the quickness of their apprehensions, and facility in learning. Before the arrival of the missionaries, their acquired knowledge was at a low ebb. What they attained after that period may possibly be lost. At that time they were very ignorant astronomers,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">ASTROLOGY.</NOTE> but much addicted to judicial astrology; they undertake nothing without consulting some pretending
<PB N="263" REF="275"/>impostor.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">GEOGRAPHY.</NOTE> As to geography they made the world consist of three parts, <HI>China, Siam,</HI> and <HI>Japan.</HI> We may see by their maps their extent in that branch of science; we have one as a proof in the <HI>British Museum.</HI></P>
<P>THEIR skill in physic is not less moderate;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">PHYSIC.</NOTE> their great art is that of the pulse. The physicians first feel one arm and then another, as if the impulse did not come from the same machine, the heart. Their <HI>Aesculapius</HI> or <HI>Apollo,</HI> is the god <HI>Jakusi.</HI> They have very few remedies; two form the principal, the one is the <HI>Acu-punctura,</HI> or pricking with the needle,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">ACU-PUNCTURA.</NOTE> in use for a dreadful species of colic common in <HI>Japan.</HI> The professors in the art make use of certain needles; and form with much ceremony and superstition, the punctures in three rows
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Kaempfer, ii. App. p. 29. tab. 43.</NOTE>. But this ope∣ration is applied for the cure of other disorders
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">A singular coincidence with the Chinese-practice, mentioned by Dr. Gillan. Embassy, vol. ii. p. 249. E.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE other great remedy is the <HI>Moxa,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">MOXA.</NOTE> a caustic applied in almost every distemper. It is made of the leaves of the <HI>Arte∣misia vulgaris,</HI> and being set on fire, is placed on the part affected. The flame is not visible, nor is the burning attended with any considerable pain. The astrologers are consulted on the occasion, who have figures of the human body drawn like the man in the almanack, with all its parts marked to which the <HI>Moxa</HI> is to be applied
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Kaempfer, ii. tab. 44.</NOTE>, for the physicians seem to act with pe∣culiar reverence to the influence of the stars.</P>
<P>THIS remedy is also in use in <HI>India,</HI> and other countries in <HI>Asia.</HI> It has even been introduced into <HI>Europe</HI> as a cure for the
<PB N="264" REF="276"/>gout, but I believe with such little success, that the practice has long since been exploded.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Japanese</HI> have another medicine,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A FAMOUS POWDER.</NOTE> a powder to be taken internally in colicky diseases. The inventor had the art to give out that it was communicated to him in a dream by <HI>Jakusi</HI> the god of physic, which stamped such a veneration for this medicine, that he enriched himself so greatly as to build a temple with part of his gains, and the family, who keep the <HI>nostrum</HI> to themselves, have erected two or three more; the chief ingredient is supposed to be the <HI>China</HI> root, great quantities of which, and also of the <HI>Ginseng</HI> root, is imported into <HI>Japan</HI> for medical purposes.</P>
<P>BOTANY is much studied by the physicians of the empire, and many books are composed on the subject. Dr. <HI>Thunberg</HI> met with two physicians at <HI>Jedo</HI> who had great knowledge, not only in their own profession, but in botany, mineralogy, and zoology.</P>
<P>THE famous <HI>Terra Japonica</HI> or <HI>Catechu</HI> is prepared chiefly at <HI>Odowara;</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">CATECHU.</NOTE> the principal ingredient is foreign, being an ex∣tract from the <HI>Mimosa Catechu</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Woodville's Med. Bot. vol. ii. p. 183. tab. 86.</NOTE>, a small tree which grows in great plenty on the mountains of <HI>Hindoostan,</HI> not the <HI>Areca catechu,</HI> as had been long supposed; we were first favored with this discovery by Mr. <HI>Ker,</HI> assistant surgeon in <HI>Bengal:</HI> Much is manufactured in the province of <HI>Bahar;</HI> an ointment is com∣posed from it of general repute throughout <HI>India,</HI> being found a most useful astringent in that hot climate. It has for a great length of time kept its place in our dispensatory as an efficacious medicine in weakness of the bowels in general, and the con∣sequential
<PB N="265" REF="277"/>fluxes. It has also been used with much success as an antiseptic, in cases of a putrid dissolved state of the blood, by the great physicians <HI>Huxham</HI> and <HI>Pringle.</HI> In <HI>Japan</HI> it is sold perfumed, and made up in various forms for the use chiefly of the ladies, who hold it in great esteem to fasten their teeth, and give a sweetness to their breath.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Japanese</HI> are fond of good paintings,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">PAINTINGS.</NOTE> and the rich will give immense prices for pieces of merit. As to their own artists they are on a level with those of the <HI>Chinese,</HI> but excel us greatly in the beauty of their colors.</P>
<P>THEIR cabinet-works,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">JAPAN WORKS.</NOTE> and the several things which go under the common name of <HI>Japan,</HI> are well known for the excellency of the varnish, which surpasses that of all the world. The black also is most intense, and the coloring or painting exquisite; as to the brass furniture of the cabinets, it is very coarse and clumsy. But the <HI>Japanese</HI> excel in iron manufactures;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">STEEL.</NOTE> their metal is of the best quality; their arms are muskets, bows and arrows, dag∣gers, and scymitars. The last of a most remarkable temper; it is customary to try the edge on the bodies of executed malefac∣tors, which they cut to pieces by way of experiment.</P>
<P>WHEN I am on the subject of arms,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">ARMY.</NOTE> I may mention the mi∣litary of the empire. It is computed that the standing army con∣sists of a hundred thousand foot and twenty thousand horse. In a kingdom which can have no foreign wars, nor fears intestine tumults, this is surprising; but since the conspiracy of the <HI>Por∣tuguese,</HI> and the extirpation of Christianity, the emperors have been in constant fears of plots and invasions from the <HI>European</HI> powers.</P>
<P><PB N="266" REF="278"/>LET me now return to the arts.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">PRINTING.</NOTE> Printing has been among them from time immemorial; like the <HI>Chinese,</HI> they cut the letters on blocks of wood, but excel them in neatness; they print and write like that nation. In this art, and in several others, as well as in customs, there is such an agreement that I cannot doubt but that the <HI>Chinese</HI> were their original instructors in science; but, as is often the case, the scholar has excelled the master.</P>
<P>THEY also claim the invention of gunpowder,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">GUNPOWDER.</NOTE> but remain in∣ferior to the <HI>Chinese</HI> in its uses, not only in artillery, but in all species of fire-works.</P>
<P>THE architecture of the <HI>Japanese</HI> resembles in some degree that of the <HI>Chinese;</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">ARCHITECTURE.</NOTE> it is much more plain, being not loaden with ornaments as that of <HI>China.</HI> The common houses are small, consisting of two stories; the upper of which is seldom inha∣bited, and the rest is almost destitute of furniture, except mats, and a small table to eat on. The cedar <HI>(Juniperus virginiana)</HI> fir, and the bamboo, are the great materials for building. Their mirrors are made of metal, but never used but at their toilets. The windows are covered with a white paper thin enough to admit the light.</P>
<P>THE castles of the nobility consist of three different inclosures,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">CASTLES.</NOTE> one round the other, and are defended by a deep ditch; but never by artillery: they are usually at the skirts of large towns; the owners are bound to keep them in repair.</P>
<P>THE temples are often very magnificent,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">TEMPLES.</NOTE> and some are pecu∣liarly remarkable for the height of the roof, the elegance of the sculpture, and beauty of the gilding and painting.</P>
<P><PB N="267" REF="279"/>HERE are considerable manufactures of silk and cotton,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">SILK AND COTTON.</NOTE> the produce of their own country; but the <HI>Dutch</HI> are allowed to import a great quantity of cloths, stuffs, chintzes and cottons.</P>
<P>THE dress of the better sort of people are silk, of the lower,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">HABITS.</NOTE> cotton. Their habits are loose gowns with large sleeves. In summer they are thin; in winter quilted; and often they put on one or more additional, according to the severity of the season. The women's apparel resembles the men's, only the gowns of the former are much longer, and trail on the ground; men of rank also wear trowsers, and short black jackets placed over their gowns. They use sandals, but do not wear stockings; and always go bare-headed, except in a journey, when they put on a conical cap of straw; at other times they protect themselves from the sun and rain by fans and umbrellas.</P>
<P>THE manufacture of porcelain is of great antiquity.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">PORCELAIN.</NOTE></P>
<P>I CONCLUDE the account of <HI>Japan</HI> with a very brief mention of the two capitals, of which <HI>Miaco</HI> is the most antient,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">MIACO.</NOTE> and the
original seat of empire. The plan is given by <HI>Kaempfer</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hist. of Japan, vol. ii. tab. 27.</NOTE>, copied from the original now deposited in the <HI>British Museum,</HI> by which it appears most regularly built, the streets crossing each other at right angles. It lies in about Lat. 35° 40′ north, in a large plain, surrounded with beautiful verdant hills and moun∣tains, and watered by numbers of small streams. <HI>Miaco</HI> is the residence of the <HI>Dairo,</HI> or ecclesiastical emperor, and is full of manufactures of all kinds, being the chief mercantile town in the empire. Here, the richest stuffs with gold and silver flowers are woven; copper smelted; and among the most trifling mat∣ters, are made the puppets with moving heads.</P>
<P><PB N="268" REF="280"/>THE number of inhabitants in <HI>Kaempser</HI>'s time was 529,726, of which 52,169 were ecclesiastics.</P>
<P>VARIOUS streams unite and form a river which flows from hence to the great commercial city and port of <HI>Osacca,</HI> on a fine bay; which last is said to be so populous, that in case of need it could send forth an army of eighty thousand men.</P>
<P>DOCTOR <HI>Kaempfer</HI> gives
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hist. of Japan, vol. ii. p. 468. tab. 25.</NOTE> a very good idea of the beauty and singularity of some of the coasts between <HI>Miaco</HI> and <HI>Osacca,</HI> in his views of <HI>Simoasi, Morizu,</HI> and <HI>Muru,</HI> with the semicircular hills with which those places are backed, most characteristically cultivated to the very tops.</P>
<P><HI>Jedo,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">JEDO.</NOTE> the residence of the temporal, and in fact the real em∣peror, is built with far less regularity
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol. ii. tab. 39.</NOTE>, because built by degrees, and on no certain plan: It stands in Lat. 35° 32′ north. The palace is very large, and covers a vast extent of ground. The city has great numbers of temples dedicated to <HI>Amida,</HI> and the various deities; the ecclesiastics are of course prodigiously nume∣rous. The houses are in general small and mean, and liable to frequent fires; four thousand have been burnt by a single ac∣cident. A large river runs through the city, and falls into the harbor; one branch encompasses the castle, and divided into five streams, unites with the other in the port.</P>
<P>THE naval force of the <HI>Japanese</HI> is very small,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">NAVY.</NOTE> the emperors not having thought proper to maintain a fleet since the expulsion of foreigners, presuming it impossible to have quarrels with na∣tions with whom they could have no intercourse.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">SHIPPING.</NOTE> The merchant ships, which are built only for conveying goods from island to island, are most clumsily made, and by the emperor's order, in
<PB N="269" REF="281"/>such a form as renders it impossible for them to go far to sea. They are commonly about twenty-eight yards long, and eight broad. The stern is square, with a hole left in the middle, ex∣pressly to increase the danger of distant navigation; both stern and prow are very lofty. The ships have only one mast, and are constructed for rowing as well as failing. The figures in <HI>Kaempfer</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Kaempfer, Hist. of Japan, vol. ii. tab. 21.</NOTE> will give the best notion of their form.</P>
<P><HI>Korea,</HI> and certain other territories,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">KOREA.</NOTE> have been long tributary to the <HI>Japanese</HI> empire. The neighboring <HI>Korea</HI> shall be first mentioned. I refer the reader to a future volume for farther particulars of that country. Here I shall briefly add its history as far as concerns the <HI>Japanese.</HI> It had been conquered first by <HI>Mikaddo Tsiuu Ai,</HI> emperor of <HI>Japan,</HI> and after that, <HI>Anno Christi</HI> 201, by his relict <HI>Dsin Ju,</HI> a princess celebrated for her abilities and valor. The <HI>Koreans</HI> in time shook off the <HI>Japanese</HI> yoke, and continued independent till <HI>Taiko,</HI> having usurped the secular em∣pire, in order to free himself from such of the nobility who were disaffected to his government (and under pretence of reducing the <HI>Koreans</HI>) sent them at the head of a potent army: they landed on the continent, obliged the <HI>Koreans</HI> (but not without the bravest resistance) to become once more tributary to the empire. <HI>Taiko</HI> died, the affairs of <HI>Korea</HI> were neglected, and the <HI>Japanese</HI> driven down to the coasts, and of all their conquests left only in possession of the maritime parts of the province of <HI>Tsiosijn,</HI> and two islands, one called <HI>Iku,</HI> the other <HI>Tsussima,</HI> on which is kept a garrison of fifty men; but these islands are neither remarkable for their size or their fertility.</P>
<P><PB N="270" REF="282"/>THE articles brought from thence are cod,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">PRODUCE.</NOTE> and other fish pickled, walnuts, rare medicinal plants, and flowers, and the famous <HI>Gingseng</HI> roots, and before the imperial prohibition, cer∣tain earthen pots made in the <HI>Tartarian</HI> provinces of <HI>Japii</HI> and <HI>Niuke.</HI></P>
<P>THE other country dependent on <HI>Japan,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">ISLE OF MATMAY.</NOTE> is the island of <HI>Matmay</HI> or <HI>Matsumai,</HI> part of the land of <HI>Jeso,</HI> divided from the north end of <HI>Nipon</HI> by an incurvated streight, in the nearest place sixty <HI>versts,</HI> or forty-five miles broad. According to <HI>Char∣levoix,</HI> in his <HI>Fastes Chronologiques,</HI> the first <HI>European</HI> who visited that island was father <HI>Jerom de Angelis,</HI> a <HI>Sicilian</HI> jesuit, who went there by sea from <HI>Japan,</HI> and landed at the capital. He reached it in the year 1620, and returned in 1621, but without being certain whether it was an island or part of the continent, nor has he left us any account, either of it or its inhabitants.</P>
<P>THE next <HI>Europeans</HI> who visited this country were the <HI>Dutch,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">LAND OF JESO.</NOTE> who in 1643 sailed from the <HI>Cape Nabo</HI> in the ships <HI>Castricom,</HI> captain <HI>De Vries,</HI> and the <HI>Breskes,</HI> on a voyage of discovery off the coasts of <HI>Tartary.</HI> In Lat. 44° 30′ north, they fell in with what they call <HI>Eso</HI> or <HI>Jeso.</HI> Whether this was the north extre∣mity of <HI>Matsumai,</HI> or another land almost contiguous to it, does not appear. By Mr. <HI>Arrowsmith</HI>'s map it should seem that these discoverers sailed along the eastern coast of a certain country from the most southern part of <HI>Matsumai,</HI> as high as Lat. 49° 30′, and gave names to several bays or points of lands. As to the western sides of the region, they probably are quite undisco∣vered. In the map I am so partial to, not only that coast, but those of the corresponding continent are left undetermined,
<PB N="271" REF="283"/>noted only with dotted lines, even as high as the south end of the island of <HI>Sachalin.</HI> The intermediate space is the supposed streight of <HI>Jeso.</HI> Whether the land of <HI>Jeso</HI> is, as Mr. <HI>Müller</HI> con∣jectures, any more than an archipelago, or whether it is part of the <HI>Tartarian</HI> continent, at present remains extremely doubtful. <HI>Matsumai</HI> alone seems to have been proved to be an island.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The voyage of the unfortunate <HI>de la Perouse,</HI> has thrown considerable light on the hitherto undescribed land of <HI>Jeso,</HI> and the op∣posite shore of <HI>Tartary.</HI> After coasting for some time the inhospitable isles of <HI>Japan,</HI> that able navigator traversed the intervening sea, till he came in sight of the continent of <HI>Asia,</HI> in Lat. 42°, which he followed in a northerly di∣rection, and in Lat. 45° 13′ landed at the <HI>Baie de Ternai.</HI> Here he found a country of the most abundant vegetation, but shewing no signs of being occupied, except by wandering hunt∣ers, or occasional visitants by sea. Game of all kinds were seen in quantities, and the sea afforded a copious supply of cod, herring, and falmon. In an excursion inland, some of the party discovered a tomb, in which were deposited two bodies clad in the skin of bears, <HI>Chinese</HI> coin, and copper ornaments were attached to their girdles, and near them lay silver earings, an iron hatchet, a knife, a wooden spoon, a comb, and a small bag of rice.</P>
<P>Still pursuing the coasts of <HI>Chinese Tartary,</HI> the navigators touched at a bay to which they gave the name of <HI>Suffrein,</HI> situated in Lat. 47° 51′; continual fogs retarded their progress. In Lat. 48° 35′ they discovered to the east the apparently rocky and barren shores of the no∣minal land of <HI>Jeso,</HI> part of the vast island <HI>Tehoka</HI> or <HI>Sachalin,</HI> to which they sailed. They found the inhabitants advanced to a considerable de∣gree of civilization in consequence of their intercourse with the <HI>Chinese,</HI> parts of whose dress they had adopted, and with whom, and the <HI>Mantchew Tartars,</HI> they carried on a trade in dried fish and oil. Leaving these intelligent islanders, who had traced on the sand with al∣most geographical accuracy the object of his farther enquiry, <HI>de la Perouse</HI> proceeded north∣wards, and touched at a spot he denominated <HI>Baie d'Estaing;</HI> the channel between <HI>Tehoka</HI> and the continent narrowed to the distance of twelve leagues; the soundings also became gra∣dually less, and in Lat. 51° 45′ did not exceed nine fathoms. The enterprizing spirit of a <HI>Cook</HI> or a <HI>Vancouver</HI> seemed here wanting; <HI>de la Perouse,</HI> after a trial of a few hours, remained satisfied that a bank of sand, over which boats only could pass, connected the shores and closed the extremity of the vast gulf. He however draws the just conclusion, that the island called <HI>Sachalin</HI> by the <HI>Rus∣sians,</HI> the northern extremity of which has long been known, extends from the 46th to the 54th degrees of latitude, and consequently includes a portion of the <HI>Yedzo,</HI> or <HI>Jeso</HI> of our geographers. The straights which separate this island from that of <HI>Matsumay,</HI> are ascer∣tained with accuracy, and justly distinguished by the name of the French navigator.—On the return of the ships from their fruitless at∣tempt to penetrate into the sea of <HI>Ochotsk,</HI> they entered the <HI>Baie de Castries,</HI> on the coast of <HI>Tartary.</HI> Here was situated a small village, inhabited by a race whose high cheek bones and small eyes announced its origin; but it appeared only the occasional residence of dif∣ferent tribes for the purpose of fishing, who carry the produce of their labor to the <HI>Mant∣chew Tartars,</HI> living on the banks of the great river <HI>Segalien</HI> or <HI>Amur,</HI> from whom they re∣ceive in exchange for their dried salmon, grain, nanquin, and other articles probably brought from <HI>China.</HI> The custom of leaving in their huts, during the long season of absence for the purposes of commerce, their bows, arrows, nets, and such furniture as their few wants require, constitutes an interesting proof of the honesty of this harmless race of people; in several par∣ticulars they agree with the natives of <HI>Kam∣chatka;</HI> and tombs far exceeding the propor∣tion of the apparent population, excited similar astonishment, and gives the same cause for in∣vestigation, as the numerous memorials of the dead on the coast of <HI>America</HI> observed by <HI>Van∣couver.</HI></P>
<P><HI>De la Perouse,</HI> after doubling <HI>Cape Crillon,</HI> the southern extremity of the island <HI>Sachalin,</HI> in Lat. 45° 57′, landed in a secure bay, inhabited by a tribe of a darker complexion than those of the north, and more industrious; their utensils and dress shewed their intercourse with the <HI>Japanese.</HI> The distance from hence to the northern shores of the isle of <HI>Matsamay,</HI> does not exceed twelve leagues. The navigators here fell into the track, and had the opportunity of rendering justice to the veracity, of the Dutch voyagers in 1643. E.</P></NOTE>
<PB N="272" REF="284"/>That all the tract which the <HI>Dutch</HI> saw to the west is that land of <HI>Jeso,</HI> there can be no dispute; even <HI>Matsumai</HI> is compre∣hended under that name: that island was early annexed to the <HI>Japanese</HI> empire, and is chiefly peopled with exiles. We have two accounts of the inhabitants of this country; one is left us by Cap∣tain <HI>Saris,</HI> the other by the <HI>Dutch</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Purchas's Pilgr. vol. i. p. 384.</NOTE>, the former gives us the fol∣lowing information on the subject, which he collected from a sen∣sible <HI>Japanese</HI> who had actually visited the island of <HI>Matsumai;</HI> we may collect from him that it was known to the <HI>Japanese</HI> by the name of <HI>Yedso</HI> or <HI>Jeso.</HI> The relation beginning thus:</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">DESCRIBED.</NOTE><Q>THAT <HI>Yedso</HI> is an island, and lyeth on the north-west side of <HI>Japan,</HI> and distant from thence ten leagues; that the people are white, and of good condition, but very hairy all their bo∣dies over like munkeyes. Their weapones are bowes and ar∣rowes
<PB N="273" REF="285"/>poysoned. The people in the southernmost part thereof doe understand weight and measure, whereof within the land thirtie dayes journey they are ignorant. They haue much silver and sand gold, whereof they make payment to the <HI>Jap∣panners</HI> for rice, &amp;c. Rice and cotton cloath of <HI>Japan,</HI> is heere well requested, iron and lead is brought to them from <HI>Japan.</HI> Necessaries for the belly and backe are most vendible to them; rice transported from <HI>Japan</HI> to <HI>Yedso,</HI> hath yeelded foure for one.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THE town where the <HI>Japanners</HI> have their chiefe residence and mart is called <HI>Matchma,</HI> therein are five hundred house∣hold of <HI>Japanners,</HI> who likewise have a fort there, the gover∣nour whereof is called <HI>Matchmadonna.</HI> This towne of <HI>Match∣ma,</HI> is the principall marte towne of all <HI>Yedzo,</HI> whither the na∣tines most resort to buy and sell, especially in <HI>September</HI> for their prouision for winter. In <HI>March,</HI> they bring downe sal∣mon, and dryed fish of sundrie sorts, and other wares for which the <HI>Japanners</HI> barter, which the <HI>Japanners</HI> rather desire than siluer.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THE <HI>Japanners</HI> haue no setled being or trade in any other towne then <HI>Matchma.</HI> That further to the northward upon the same land, are people of very low stature like dwarfes. That the <HI>Yedzos</HI> are people of the stature of the <HI>Japanners,</HI> and haue no apparell but what is brought them from <HI>Japan.</HI> That there settleth a very violent current between <HI>Yedzo</HI> and <HI>Japan,</HI> which commeth from <HI>Corea,</HI> and setteth to the east-north-east. That the winds are for the most part, as usually they are in <HI>Japan,</HI> viz. that the northerly winds beginne in
<PB N="274" REF="286"/><HI>September,</HI> and end in <HI>March,</HI> and then the southerly winds be∣gin to blow.</Q></P>
<P>THE account given by the commander of the <HI>Castricom,</HI> con∣curs in a great measure with the above. The author of the <HI>Recueil de Voyages au Nord,</HI> vol. iv. has preserved the voyage. It appears that the captain had landed in several places; that in Lat. 44° 30′, he found the country very mountanous and high, co∣vered with lofty trees, many of which were fit for masts; the soil very clayey and wet, and near the shores covered with brush∣wood; it was reported that there were several rich silver mines.</P>
<P>IN Lat. 45° 10′,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">ACQUIES.</NOTE> at a place called <HI>Acquies,</HI> the land was very high, and covered with trees. The soil clayey, but producing good fruits, such as mulberries, red and white gooseberries, raspberries, &amp;c. also oaks and other kinds of trees, and in the vallies lilies of a vast height. The rivers are bordered by rushes, and also with red roses.</P>
<P>IN Lat. 46° 30′, he fell into a great gulph abounding with salmon, the shore was covered with vegetables, and had the ap∣pearance of the coasts of <HI>England;</HI> but the natives neither cul∣tivated the ground, nor made any advantage of their rich soil. The most northern part of the range which he touched at on this coast, was in Lat. 48° 50′, where he found the land rise into little hills cloathed with herbage; and met with good ancho∣rage, in from 25 to 40 fathoms depth, with a bottom of sand.</P>
<P>HE speaks in general of the inhabitants of the coast of <HI>Jeso</HI> as being strong and square made,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">NATIVES OF JESO.</NOTE> short and gross, their hair and beard long, and the last so thick as almost to cover their whole face; their bodies likewise very hairy; the hair on the
<PB N="275" REF="287"/>fore part of the head is shaved. The features are tolerably good, their eyes black, forehead flat, complexion yellow; both sexes wear rings in their ears and on their fingers. Their dress is of the <HI>Japanese</HI> fashion; some is made of silk, others of stuff, and others of the skins of animals.</P>
<P>THEIR houses are built against the slope of a hill,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">HOUSES.</NOTE> constructed of planks, and covered with the bark of trees; they are sup∣ported by the trunks, and have an hole at top to let out the smoke; their fire-place is in the middle of the floor; their doors so low that they are obliged to creep in. The only fur∣niture is matting made by the women; to these add a cup and a plate of varnished ware for each individual in the family. In some respects the houses resemble those of <HI>Nootka Sound,</HI> and are in groups of fifteen or twenty, each group about half a league distant from the other, and each seems to be peopled with a kindred clan.</P>
<P>THE common food of the natives is the lard and oil of whales,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">FOOD.</NOTE> fish, and all sorts of vegetables, especially the fruit of roses, which are as large as medlars, and being dried, are considered as excel∣lent winter provision. Notwithstanding this, they often die of cold or famine. It is customary with them to put their dead into a case, and cover them with oyster-shells; these are sup∣ported by four posts, placed beneath huts neatly made.</P>
<P>THE natives of <HI>Matsumai</HI> shew very few signs of religion,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">RELIGION.</NOTE> nor have they any idols. When they drink, if they are near the fire, they pour a few drops into it; they also stick in their chambers some small rods with little flags at the end. If a
<PB N="276" REF="288"/>person falls sick, they cut long slips of the wood, and tie them round the head and arms of the patient.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the rude appearance of these people,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">MANNERS.</NOTE> they are prudent and civilized in their manners, and among strangers pay them the compliment of putting on their best cloaths.</P>
<P>THEY are a very indolent race; never cultivate the ground, but pass much of their time on the water in canoes, which they call <HI>praos,</HI> cut out of the trunk of some great tree, raised on the side with planks. In these they go to the chace of seals, which they shoot with arrows, or of whales, which they harpoon. They beside catch other fishes with seines, in the manner done in <HI>Europe.</HI> Several objects of chace are mentioned. Birds they catch in snares; and shoot with arrows elks, roes, stags, bears, and other animals unknown to the <HI>Dutch</HI> navigators. Besides the weapons I have mentioned, they wear a short cutlass made of iron, which they procure from the <HI>Japanese.</HI></P>
<P>HEMP grows wild in the country,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">HEMP.</NOTE> the women spin it, I sup∣pose by splitting it first; they then hold one end between their teeth, and turn and twist it into thread on a distaff.</P>
<P>THE natives exchange with the <HI>Japanese</HI> the lard and oil of whales and fishes, the dried tongues of whales, furs, and fea∣thers of eagles, for winging of arrows. The people of <HI>Japan</HI> pay them an annual visit, and bring in return rice, sugar, silken cloaths in the <HI>Japanese</HI> fashion, smoaking-pipes, tobacco, and varnished cups and plates. The <HI>Japanese</HI> seem to have intro∣duced civilization among these people by their intercourse with
<PB N="277" REF="289"/>them. The <HI>Chinese</HI> sometimes come and trade with them. The capital of this chain of islands is called <HI>Matsumai,</HI> and is the re∣sidence of the prince or governor, who annually makes a voyage to <HI>Jedo,</HI> to do homage to the emperor. The <HI>Japanese</HI> once at∣tempted to extend their conquests from <HI>Matsumai</HI> northward; they succeeded at first, but after a revolt of the inhabitants
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Kaempfer, i. p. 65.</NOTE>, are now content to accept from the chieftain, whom they stile prince of <HI>Jeso,</HI> a tribute of very small value, which is annually paid at <HI>Matsumai.</HI></P>
<P>WE now arrive at the southernmost isles of the long chain of the <HI>Kurils.</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">KURIL ISLES.</NOTE> I have given an account of the most northern in my introduction to the <HI>Arctic Zoology.</HI> The whole chain di∣verges to the north-east in a direct line, and concludes very near to the cape of <HI>Lopatka,</HI> in <HI>Kamschatka.</HI> The <HI>Russians</HI> reckon <HI>Matsumai</HI> among the number. Those next to the land of <HI>Jeso</HI> were discovered by the <HI>Casticrom. Tschicota, Kounaschir,</HI> and <HI>Atorkou</HI> are the most southern; the two first lie opposite to <HI>Mat∣sumai,</HI> and at no great distance from its coasts, and <HI>Atorkou</HI> a little to the north-east. <HI>Tschicota</HI> is a hundred and twenty versts, or ninety miles long, and forty miles broad. <HI>Kounaschir</HI> is about a hundred and twelve miles long, and about thirty-seven broad, and <HI>Atorkou,</HI> or <HI>Etorpu,</HI> is equal in length and breadth, being two hundred and twenty-five miles across, according to the <HI>Rus∣sian</HI> accounts in the <HI>Neue Nordische Beytrage</HI>
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Vol. iv. 133.</NOTE>. This island is the <HI>Staten-land</HI> of the <HI>Dutch,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">STATEN-LAND.</NOTE> a name bestowed on it in their voyage of 1643.</P>
<P><HI>Ouropi</HI> is the <HI>Company</HI>'s land of the same voyagers;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">COMPANY'S LAND.</NOTE> and they
<PB N="278" REF="290"/>bestowed on the streight which separates it from <HI>Atorkou</HI> the name of <HI>De Vries's,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">DE VRIES'S STREIGHT.</NOTE> in honor of their commander. No places have puzzled geographers so greatly. <HI>D'Anville</HI> gives to <HI>Jeso, Josogasima,</HI> as it is sometimes called, the form of a vast island; and to the <HI>Company's Land</HI> and <HI>Staten-land</HI> a figure possibly very different from the reality. The editors of <HI>Cook</HI>'s Voyage make them only small islands. The <HI>Russians</HI> again, in their his∣tory of <HI>Kamschatka,</HI> give them another form; and Mr. <HI>Arrow-smith</HI> very properly leaves it undecided whether <HI>Jeso</HI> is conti∣nent or archipelago. This being mentioned, we hasten to the conclusion of this volume, and give a brief account of the re∣mainder of the <HI>Kuril</HI> isles. <HI>Etorpu,</HI> the nineteenth in order, reckoning from <HI>Lopatka-noss,</HI> comes next. Most of the islands of this long chain are volcanic. <HI>Raschotti,</HI> the tenth, has in our days been so rent with an earthquake, as entirely to drive away the numerous flocks of birds that used to frequent its cliffs; but the sea-lions still keep their stations.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">VOLCANOES.</NOTE> On <HI>Kounaschir,</HI> the twen∣tieth, is one volcano; on <HI>Etorpu</HI> are two; on <HI>Amakutan</HI> ano∣ther; and on the lofty <HI>Poromoschir,</HI> the highest in the chain, remarkable for its vast peaked mountains, is probably another. I have treated of these islands so fully in my introduction to the <HI>Arctic Zoology,</HI> that I shall not tire my reader with the repeti∣tion; I therefore will only say here, that many of them have been conquered by the <HI>Russians,</HI> who, not thinking them worth the expence of colonizing, content themselves with accepting a small tribute.</P>
<P>THE inhabitants resemble those of the land of <HI>Jeso,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">NATIVES.</NOTE> and are equally hairy. By the accounts of the <HI>Russians</HI> who visited these
<PB N="279" REF="291"/>islands in 1777, they differ in some of their customs from the former. They have multitudes of little household gods, like the <HI>Mongol Tartars,</HI> and they pay a worship to the owl. The <HI>Mon∣gols</HI> do the same, for the reason given in the zoological part of the <HI>Arctic Zoology</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. i. p. 272.</NOTE>. This may direct us to the origin of these islanders. They bury their dead in the earth, and believe in a future life, to be passed in certain subterraneous regions.</P>
