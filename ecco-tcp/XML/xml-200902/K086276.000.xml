<STAGE>(<HI>Martha standing by a table cutting two slices of bread and butter.</HI>)</STAGE>
<P>AFTER having laboured so hard during the best part of our lives, thus at last to fall into poverty! To what pur∣pose is it, that we have never ceased our cares and pains for a single moment, in or∣der to breed up our children with credit? If they were but of an age to earn their own bread, it would be something! My dear chil∣dren, it is not for myself, it is for you that I shed tears; in losing our cattle we have lost our all. What remains is far from be∣ing sufficient to pay our landlord. What is to become of us? If my good husband did not support my sinking courage, I should
<PB N="2" REF="6"/>die with grief. But how worthy a cha∣racter he is! What a man! How tranquil in the midst of our misfortunes! Were I not sure that affection makes him conceal the greatest part of his troubles from the fear of afflicting me, I should believe he were in∣sensible to them. "Why dost thou weep, Martha?" he often says, when I can no longer restrain my tears: "We have had a loss, it is true; but who knows what Providence has in store for us? I, for my part, make that my dependence." Alas! though never rich himself, he was always a friend to the unfortunate! How many fa∣milies in this village has he saved from mi∣sery by his advice and assistance! There is not a better man on earth; and I still possess what many women want in the midst of riches, a worthy husband, and children whose good dispositions fill our hearts with joy. Whilst I think on these blessings, I feel that Providence watches over us, and my griefs become lighter. Take courage then, Martha, enough is left to console thee in thy affliction.

<SPEAKER>Martha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Here, my child, take thy break∣fast.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jenny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, my dear mother, you have given me above half; I cannot eat all this.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Martha.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; look at it, it is no more than thy ordinary portion: you are not ill, I hope?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jenny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not at all; but I have not so good an appetite as usual.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is it you tell me? How long is it since you have been thus dainty? Come, come, eat your breakfast like a good girl.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jenny.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(taking the bread and breaking it in two</STAGE> It is too much, I assure you; half of it is sufficient for me. <STAGE>(She gives the other half to her mother)</STAGE> Here, keep this for Lucy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! has she given you the mea∣sure of her appetite, I pray?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jenny.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is enough for her; I know she will not ask for more.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>You seem to think you know your sister wonderous well; but I answer for it,
<PB N="4" REF="8"/>Lucy can eat her own share as well as you: here is a piece that I have prepared for her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jenny.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no; she will keep that for the evening, and then she will give me half in her turn: leave us alone, we have set∣tled the matter between us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>What means all this? I am curious to know.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jenny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why do you ask me? It is a se∣cret between us two: I beg, dear mother, that you will not seem as if you perceived any thing of the matter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, now you increase my curio∣sity, and I must absolutely know the bottom of this.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jenny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then, since you command it, I will tell you all: yesterday evening we overheard my father say to you, since we have suffered the loss of our cattle, we must sub∣mit to the will of Heaven, and try to turn this misfortune into a blessing; we must be the more diligent and industrious, and strive with all possible oeconomy to support our family. You replied, with an embrace, that you would be the first to set the example. I made a sign to my sister to retire; we em∣braced each other also; whatever you had engaged to do for us, we agreed together in return to do for you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="5" REF="9"/>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear children, you take too large a share in our troubles, they are not suited to your age; fear nothing, Heaven will have care of you. Oh, my child, you have made me feel the happiness of being a mother. What earthly good can equal the joy which this instance of your tender duty has given me! but be comforted. I have re∣served the remainder of this for you, and you may, at least to-day, eat your bread as usual; it is necessary that you should get strength, in order to earn something for us when you grow older. Will you not be glad to labour for your father and mother?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jenny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, glad indeed! that I shall; but we can begin now: our hands, it is true, are small, but we will work the longer for that, and all that we earn we will give to my father to purchase more cattle. Then we will rear poultry and sell our eggs; and this money, all this money, we will gladly bring to you, dear mother. <STAGE>(Seeing the tears in her mother's eyes.)</STAGE> Oh, do not weep, I beseech you; you make my heart sink.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Be satisfied; if I weep it is for joy; but it is time that thou should'st breakfast. There are many things to do in the house,
<PB N="6" REF="10"/>and I would have thy father find every thing in order at his return.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jenny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is he gone into the field with my brothers?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, he took a walk down to the hall; he wanted to speak with our land∣lord.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jenny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, so much the better. My fa∣ther always came home in good spirits from him. That Mr. Parks is an excellent man, is he not?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, my dear, hitherto he has been very good to us; pray Heaven he may con∣tinue to be so now we have occasion for it. But since our great losses, we are no longer in a condition to pay our rent; and often those who have shewn us the greatest kind∣ness, whilst we owed them nothing, look upon us with a very different eye when they think they are in danger of losing by us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jenny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Our landlord, I am sure, is not a man of this sort.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope he is not, child, or we shall be much to be pitied.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jenny.</SPEAKER>
<P>I long for my father's return to hear the good news. Will he be back this morning?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>He went out at sun rise, and I ex∣pect him back every minute.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="7" REF="11"/>
<SPEAKER>Jenny, </SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(resting her hand on the table.)</STAGE>
<P>Then before I breakfast, I will go and draw some beer to refresh him; he will be glad of a draught after his walk.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, eat your bread; I will take care of that myself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jenny.</SPEAKER>
<P>You asked me just now whether I would work for my father and mother, and now you prevent my doing so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do as you will then; I will not de∣prive you of this pleasure: your father, I know, will repay you with his caresses.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jenny.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I do not know which of us is the best pleased when I deserve them; and I will do my best to do so.</P>

<HEAD>SCENE III.</HEAD>
<SP>
<STAGE>Martha alone.</STAGE>
<P>My dear children, Heaven is my witness, it is chiefly on your account that I dread po∣verty, and yet it is from you that I receive the greatest comfort. How much more ought I to love you, since you are the only blessing that is left me. Had I never been unfortunate, I should never have had those proofs of your affection. Perhaps also you will assist me in conquering my grief, whilst I am only striving to hide it from you. No, I will not interrupt, by my murmurings,
<PB N="8" REF="12"/>the innocent gaity of your tender age. <STAGE>(She runs to the cradle, takes out the infant, and presses it in her arms, looking at it with tender∣ness.)</STAGE> It is to thee alone that I will utter my complaints; to thee who art as yet insen∣sible to the sorrows of thy parents. I may shed tears in thy presence without fearing to afflict thee. Happy infant, I weep for thy lot, whilst thou answerest me with a smile.</P>

<SPEAKER>Jenny, </SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(coming in just as Martha has the child in her arms.)</STAGE>
<P>Give it to me, mother, that I may kiss it. My little friend, when you are as able as I am, you shall work for your father and mother too. Oh, you shall see what care I will take of this little baby, that it may become strong and robust. But stay, we are busy at present, you must go sleep a little. <STAGE>(<HI>She puts it back into the cradle, whilst the mother looks affectionately at them both.</HI>)</STAGE> Mother, I have just brought the beer: will you lend me the key of the cupboard, that I may fetch some clean linen and a waistcoat for my father: I know he will return overcome with heat and fatigue.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, and if he has any good news
<PB N="9" REF="13"/>he will not care how much he fatigues him∣self, in order to hasten to us with it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jenny, </SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(shutting the cupboard, and laying the linen on a chair.)</STAGE>
<P>I know it; and then without resting he will go to the field: he never loses a moment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is a good lesson for us; you, for example, would do well to hasten your breakfast and go to school, as soon as you have asked your father's blessing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jenny.</SPEAKER>
<P>To school! Oh, no, I shall not go there now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>What do you say, Jenny? Do you not mean to learn to read and write? No, no, my child, I hope, however we may be reduced, to be always able to afford you this instruction, though I should be forced to stint myself in common necessaries for it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jenny.</SPEAKER>
<P>But there will be no occasion for any more expence on that account. Does not my brother Valentine read as fluently as our schoolmaster at his desk? He will be master to Lucy and me; he told me so this morn∣ing. Sister, said he, you know that I am allowed half an hour's rest after dinner be∣fore I return to work; well then, if you will, during that time, begin a lesson with me, I will finish it when I come home in the evening. You have nothing to do but to ap∣ply
<PB N="10" REF="14"/>diligently, and I'll answer for it, you will soon be the best scholar in the village. Let us begin to-day, and you shall see.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now, was this Valentine's own thought?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jenny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, his own indeed, mother; it would never have come into my head. It is I, said he, who have cost my parents the most, being the eldest; had they spent less on me they would have had the money for you, my sisters; I ought, therefore, to give you back the instruction that I have received, now that our father cannot afford it you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Alas, could we have known at the time that we were providing masters for him, that he would one day have wanted necessa∣ries! He has cost us something, it is true, in his education, but I do not regret it; the money has been well laid out: Valen∣tine is grateful, and does his best to give us proofs of it.</P>

<P>Are not you sadly tired with your walk?</P>

<P>No, I feel myself quite nimble: but, my poor Martha, you look sorrowful; I see you have been weeping.</P>

<P>It it true; but do not be uneasy at that, for they were tears of pleasure at having such dutiful children. If you did but know how much satisfaction they have given me this morning on your account!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>These are sweet words to me: there is not a greater happiness when we do our own duty than to see it done by those who belong to us. As I went to the Squire's this morning, my heart filled with your idea; now I return home and find my wise and children wholly engrossed by mine. What comfort is this?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, you have seen our landlord; how did he receive you?</P>

<P>As I expected: he has a feeling and good heart. He is a man, Martha, of the highest honour and humanity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed! did he compassionate our misfortunes? Tell me all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>As soon as he was informed of my arrival, without making me wait a moment, he came out to me, and took me into his best parlour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jenny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Into his best parlour!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Jenny; he was drinking coffee with his lady, and they ordered a ham on the same table for me; and Madam was so good as to cut me a slice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jenny.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, Madam herself?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, indeed, with her own hands, and in so obliging a manner—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, the dear lady!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>They would not let me speak about business till I had finished my breakfast.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>How charming is this! and then—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="13" REF="17"/>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then, my good Thorowgood, said Mr. Parks, what news? Very bad, an∣swered I; I have lost all my cattle in the space of eight days, by a disease brought on by the drought of the season. I am ruined, and I am come to inform you of it, that you may be at liberty to let your farm to another tenant. I come also to offer you all that I have left in the world: it is a great trouble to me that I have not sufficient to satisfy you; but I promise, on the word of an honest man, to labour night and day till I can do so. I shall eat of the bread of bitterness till I have paid my debt to the utmost far∣thing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, certainly, we will do it rea∣dily. What did Mr. Parks say to this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was already acquainted with your losses, honest Thorowgood, said he, and am heartily sorry for them. I pity you also, said Madam, with her sweet voice: I pity you with all my heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>The worthy couple! how good they are!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not come here, said I, to ex∣cite compassion, I have no occasion for it, as I am able to work. My great con∣cern is, that I cannot acquit myself of my debt to you: I own I feel for my wife and
<PB N="14" REF="18"/>my young family: I who would have shed my blood to preserve them from want! You who are rich and without children, know not what it is to see those suffer to whom we have given life. Ah! if you had such children as I have; if you loved them with all your soul, and were beloved by them as I am!—In saying this, grief made me hide my face; and when I lifted up my eyes again, I saw Mr. Parks was no longer looking at me: he had turned towards his wife; their eyes were filled with tears, and fixed on each other. Pity was not the only sentiment which then affected them; I plainly saw that something which more nearly concerned themselves, occupied their minds.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>And did you not ask them what it was?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>I had not the courage; but as I con∣tinued to talk of my children, Mr. Parks strove to change the discourse. I perceived clearly that some private affliction was the cause of this, and therefore hastened to quit the subject, and began talking about my corn, and reckoning how much it would yield towards paying my rent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>And pray, was not Mr. Parks very angry when he found it fall so short of that sum?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="15" REF="19"/>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>Quite the contrary; he bid me not despair. Go home to your wife, said the good gentleman, I will order my horse and be with you presently, when we will settle every thing. I have always looked upon you as an honest man, therefore I will do no∣thing in this business without your concur∣rence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is this possible? how much do we owe him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>Four hundred and fifty pounds.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Alas, alas, how shall we be ever able to pay this money!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is true; and yet had we saved our cattle, and our crops had answered this year, we should have had enough, and some∣thing over.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>But as it is, what will become of us?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why all that we can do now, is to collect together our household goods and farming utensils, and sell them to pay our landlord: we will keep nothing but what is on our backs; we can then shew ourselves before him with a clear conscience. This is the only course that we can take to avoid misery. <STAGE>(Somebody knocks softly at the door.)</STAGE></P>

<P>Mr. Pinch! What does he want with me, I wonder? we have never had any quarrel.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shudder with fear. We are un∣done, my dear Thorowgood. We shall be taken to jail. I know the steward; some mischief is sure to happen wherever he in∣terferes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>Compose yourself, wife; we have nothing to fear. Take away the children, and leave me alone with him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>What do you mean? I must stay with you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, leave us together; knave as he is, I am not afraid of him. You only vex me by staying: go, I beg of you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>So much the better. I am come to offer my services, and to put you in a me∣thod to defend yourself against him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>Against him! Pray was it not Mr. Parks who gave you the place that you hold? Do not you serve him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stew.</SPEAKER>
<P>I allow it, therefore I should not chuse to be seen openly in this business; my design is to support you secretly. I can re∣commend you a lawyer of this town, by whose means you shall be the gainer where you ex∣pect to lose: you understand me. He is one of those we call a shrewd, knavish, fel∣low: trust to him, he'll settle the business for you: he is my friend.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>A knavish fellow and your friend! I should have guessed so. Only see the force of sympathy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stew.</SPEAKER>
<P>You must not take things so li∣terally: I mean that he is a man capable of bringing you safe out of your embarrass∣ments, and the present juncture is very fa∣vourable
<PB N="18" REF="22"/>to you; this year having proved ruinous to the farmers in many places, will easily account for your becoming bankrupt.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall have nothing to do with your plan, Sir, but shall pay my landlord my full debt whenever fortune enables me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stew.</SPEAKER>
<P>You despise the law then, though it offers you its assistance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, I do not despise it, but I think a man's conscience should be his just law: and if I make a bargain which is not con∣trary to that, I think honour obliges me to stand to it, even though the law might dis∣charge me from it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stew.</SPEAKER>
<P>Take my word for it, neither your honour or conscience will suffer in this bu∣siness: it is not your fault that you have had those losses.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>How do you know that? perhaps I was to blame to purchase so many cattle at once; had I bought but the half, my loss would not have been so great, and I should have had money enough left to pay my rent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stew.</SPEAKER>
<P>And be it your fault or not, the thing is done now. And are you aware of what you expose yourself to, when you leave all to the discretion of Mr. Parks? Why he has it in his power to throw you into prison.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="19" REF="23"/>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>And if he has that power, why should I seek to take it from him? and if he means to treat me with humanity, why rob him of that pleasure?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stew.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, suppose he should not prove rigorous, he is mortal, you know; and his heirs may not be so tractable; whereas, if you follow my advice, you may secure your∣self from accidents, and procure a final ac∣quittance of the debt.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! can your lawyer make my landlord believe that he is paid before he has received his just due?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stew.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; but after having made him∣self acquainted with your affairs, he can settle them much to your advantage, and put some money in your pocket besides; you understand me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not want his assistance for this; I can make the matter as clear to my land∣lord myself; he knows very well the mis∣fortunes which have reduced me. I cannot now pass for a man of property.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stew.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very true, but one ought always to do things by rule. Now this lawyer whom I recommend, is one of the best in the country in managing a business of this sort: besides, I mean myself to lend you every assistance in my power.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="20" REF="24"/>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot imagine what may be your motive for acting in this manner so much against the Squire's interest, unless it is be∣cause he appears willing to settle my affairs without consulting you, and so deprive you of the perquisites of your office.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stew.</SPEAKER>
<P>What perquisites?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, come, we know how most stewards make their fortunes. You all love to fish in troubled waters.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stew.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, you talk at random. I only mean to be your friend in this. Put your affair into my hands and those of my friend; we will settle them, I'll answer for it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not doubt it. And so, Mr. Pinch, you think I will let you, to whom I owe nothing, have the fingering of my mo∣ney, in order to defraud my landlord, to whom I owe so much; besides the many obligations that I have to him for his con∣stant goodness to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stew.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, you will not be the less his debtor for this; all your effects are not suf∣ficient to clear your account with him. Now if you take my advice, you may pre∣serve a part, and all that you earn hereafter will be your own.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot see the thing in this light: I am determined to give up all that I have
<PB N="21" REF="25"/>to my landlord; and whatever I can save hereafter, I will lay by to pay the remain∣der of my debt to him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stew.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is it your design then to exhaust your strength by labour, without reaping the profit? Do you mean to pass your whole life in working for others?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho. </SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(with emotion.)</STAGE>
<P>You do not know the pleasure which a man has in being satisfied with himself. With what tears of joy shall I, from time to time, carry to Mr. Parks the fruits of my industry! What happiness shall I experience in having it in my power to prove my gratitude, and to convince him that he was not deceived, when he took me for an honest man, and that when I lost my little fortune, I did not lose my probity also!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stew.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, Thorowgood, Thorowgood, I see you do not know your own interest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>You mean, that I do not promote yours. Do you think that I am to be made thus the dupe to your avarice? You want to draw me into a knavish act, in order to reap the profit of it yourself. Why do you not go to my landlord, and offer him your services against me? It is because you know he has too much goodness to seek my ruin, and yet you thought that I might be un∣grateful enough to deprive him of his just
<PB N="22" REF="26"/>due. No, Mr. Pinch, you may, if you please, forget your obligations to him; for my part, I shall remember mine as long as I live. I have had no occasion for you hi∣therto, and I think I shall be able to do without you in future. Go then, and seek clients elsewhere for your roguish friends.</P>
</SP>

<P>What, do you dare to abuse me? Do you know that I can, soon or late, make you feel my vengeance?</P>

<P>Well, I believe you would not de∣ceive me, unless it be to quiet my uneasiness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>Be satisfied then; I have some good news for you. I thought that Humphries had lost all his cattle as well as I; but upon casting my eye over our garden, I saw on the other side the hedge four fine cows grazing in the meadow below.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="24" REF="28"/>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>You must know there is a bargain between us, which gives me a right to two of those beasts.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>How is that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will tell you: when the disease first broke out amongst our cattle, I saw Humphries was quite cast down by it; as I had always hitherto been more fortunate than he, I offered to do all in my power to serve him. He thanked me in so affecting a manner, that I wished to give him some proof of my good will to him upon the spot. You must know, just before the disorder appeared, we had made a joint purchase of twelve cows at a neigh∣bouring fair. It is true, I advanced two∣thirds of the money; but upon his consent∣ing to graze them for a certain time on his farm, (which was an excellent bargain for him in point of money, as we set∣tled it) I told him that whatever of the herd should escape the mortality, we would divide equally between us. At that time I had no reason to think that this arrangement would turn out in my favour; and now, though it has, I should be far from taking advantage of it if it regarded myself alone; but I am no longer master of my own. I am obliged to give up all my remain∣ing
<PB N="25" REF="29"/>property to my landlord. I should, therefore, think myself guilty of a theft, if I did not, on this account, lay claim to every thing due to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>And have you seen Humphries since our losses?</P>

<P>No evasions, Humphries, tell me plainly; was not this agreed between us?</P>

<P>I cannot deny it, neighbour; but one says many things that one does not al∣ways stand to. Do but consider my situa∣tion; to have so fine a herd of cattle as I had, and to save but four of them!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am much more to be pitied for be∣ing under the necessity of asking them of you. When we made the bargain, which of us was most likely to be the gainer by it? Had not I the greatest number of cows? Did not I agree to it out of kindness to you? and did not you yourself look upon it in that light?</P>

<P>To be sure, neighbour; but after so great a loss—</P>

<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>I see, then, the extent of your inte∣grity.

<P>No, but since my losses, being no longer in a condition to pay, I have given him up all that I possess.</P>
</SP>

<P>Are you mad, Thorowgood? why you have the law on your side; till your grain is made over to your landlord, by some se∣curity, it belongs to you, and you may do what you please with it. Come, come, you have lost too much already; ask Martha what she thinks of the matter?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, I think that we ought, in the first place, to pay our debts, at any rate; if we have lost our cattle, our landlord has not gained by it; the loss, therefore, is our affair, not his.</P>

<P>Aye, but the gallows!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, that alone restrains you: but if I were to judge you, Meadows, I would let you see that you do not deserve it the less for what you have just now proposed to me. I see no difference, for my part, between rob∣bing a man of his money, or robbing him of the fruits of his land.</P>

<P>I do not desire it, indeed; there is little to be got by this way of reasoning.

<P>If his heart were like yours, I should have reason to fear this.</P>

<STAGE>(calmly.)</STAGE>
<P>I, Thorowgood! Did you ever hear any thing of that kind from me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho. </SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(throwing himself into his arms.)</STAGE>
<P>No, never, never; forgive me; it was the re∣mains of my indignation which transported me. Did you know what has happened to me within this hour, you would excuse me for distrusting all mankind. The servant of my landlord wants me to commit a fraud; my friend has repaid my kindness with ingra∣titude; and the richest man in the village would barter my honesty for a trifling gain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hear.</SPEAKER>
<P>Think no more of these wretches; if they choose to make a trade of doing ill, you are too good to disturb yourself about them. Hear me: I have but two words to say: I know that it is not in your power to
<PB N="36" REF="40"/>pay Squire Parks; it is at present im∣possible for me to advance the sum that you want; but try to obtain time of your land∣lord; I will be answerable for it; he shall have my security.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mar. </SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(to Thorowgood, who seems immove∣able with surprise.)</STAGE>
<P>See, husband, what good∣ness! <STAGE>(To Hearty.)</STAGE> O my dear neighbour, how came you by so saving a thought for us?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hear.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was a very natural one: I said to myself, the kind hearted Thorowgood was always ready, to the utmost of his power, to give his assistance to others; it would be hard, indeed, if he should find no one in his turn to assist him; and I therefore am come—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar. </SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(apart.)</STAGE>
<P>It seems as if Heaven had sent him to our succour.</P>
</SP>

<P>Why, Thorowgood, art thou dumb? <STAGE>(holding out his hand.)</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho. </SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(seizing him by the hand, and pressing it between his.)</STAGE>
<P>Ah, my dear friend, Hear∣ty, I am not silent from insensibility; I feel your kindness at the bottom of my heart, but I cannot accept it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hear.</SPEAKER>
<P>And why not? it will not be useless to you. However well Mr. Parks may be disposed towards you, he will be still better pleased when he has my security for your debt.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>But who will be my security to you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="37" REF="41"/>
<SPEAKER>Hear.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your own probity, industry, and ingenuity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet you see to what I am reduc∣ed; one bad year has ruined me: a second of the same sort may add your ruin to mine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hear.</SPEAKER>
<P>No matter, I will run the risque.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I will not suffer it: it is enough that my family suffers by me without seeing my friends do so also. I should never more enjoy a moment's peace. Every fog, every cloud, the least storm of wind, would cast terror into my heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hear. </SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(with urgency.)</STAGE>
<P>My dear Thorow∣good, if you did but know how much you af∣flict me by your refusal! Will you, then, let me do nothing for you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have done enough in thus com∣forting my afflicted heart; it is torn to pieces; but the tears which I now see in your eyes are as balm to its wounds. O, my good friend, though it is a sad thing to become an object of pity, yet there is a wide difference between being pitied, and being ill spoken of! Thanks be to heaven, you will never have cause to regret having known me. In what∣ever place we meet, I shall never have occa∣sion to draw my hat over my face, or turn aside my head, to avoid the shame of blushing in your presence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="38" REF="42"/>
<SPEAKER>Hear.</SPEAKER>
<P>The more you resist, the more my friendship increases; and you are so cruel, you will not give me yours in return.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>Think well of it, I beseech you: I know your slender means. Should I be your friend, were I to plunge you into difficulties, in order to draw myself out of them? No, no, my good neighbour, I am as yet guilty of the ruin of no one; and it shall never be said that I will become so. As long as I live I will sleep with a clear conscience. It is this which converts the mat of straw into a bed of down.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hear.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will press you no more; I feel that I am not worthy to put an end to your troubles; Providence, no doubt, reserves that for itself. All I ask, is, that you will de∣pend on me next to Providence; and my hands, and my little fortune, you shall always find at your service. Farewell. <STAGE>(He goes out; Thorowgood conducts him to the door, pressing his hand.)</STAGE></P>

<P>How! is this all that we have to give to our landlord? I never wished so much to have our little stock of necessaries in good

<P>I feel myself the lighter for all this; these things were like a load on my heart, which almost stifled it.</P>

<P>It does not go out of it now, how∣ever, in a bad cause.</P>

<P>My grandfather bequeathed it to his eldest grandson; but I, alas! shall not be able to leave it to mine.</P>

<P>And we will be so always, though this were the last time that we should drink together.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>For what, my dear?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>For having preserved it so well, that it will help a little towards paying our debts: see, it is in very good condition yet: they do not wear these great sleeves and large plaits now; they did not spare stuff at that time of day; and I am glad of it: why here is almost enough to make two such as are worn now.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Here is mine also; let us put them

<P>And I, Martha, am as ready as you to declare this. Yes, Valentine, you have done for us a hundred times more than we had a right to expect. I love you with all the tenderness of a real father; but, never∣theless, you know that I am not yours.
<PB N="48" REF="52"/>Had we continued in prosperity, you should have always been our son, our dear son; all my other children believe you to be their brother. I meant, after my death, that you should have shared with them the little sub∣stance which you have daily helped me to increase. This hope was a comfort to my heart, but it is destroyed; nothing now is left us, not even the distant prospect of a re-establishment.</P>

<P>And is this the moment which you have chosen to cast me from amongst the number of your children?</P>
</SP>

<P>Yes, I ought to do so; the ties of blood bind them to our lot, whatever it be; if we suffer, they ought to suffer with us; but you, what right have I to involve you in my distress? No, Valentine, I advise you as a friend; and if it must be, I command you as a father to quit an unfortunate fa∣mily. It is time that you should do some∣thing for yourself; since it is no longer in my power to give you a fortune, I rejoice that I have had you so well instructed as to enable you to gain one.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Valen.</SPEAKER>
<P>You must not remind me of these obligations, if you wish to have me aban∣don you; I must first forget them myself: you saved my life in my infancy; your wife

<P>My hands, it is true, have repaid what your hands have done for me; but my heart has not yet repaid your love. O my father, recall to your remembrance the first days of my infancy, when I was as a stranger in your family. How many times have you pressed me in your arms at your return from hard labour, which you had prolonged in order to support me. And you, my dear mother, can you forget the many tender caresses that you have lavished on me,
<PB N="50" REF="54"/>at the very time when I was eating the bread of your children? You alone received me when abandoned by all the world; and shall I now abandon you? I was your son to in∣herit your fortune, and shall I not be so to share your poverty? Alas, how much you must have despised me before you could be∣lieve me capable of this!</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>(Martha attempts to speak, but her voice is stifled by her sighs.)</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>Despise you, Valentine! No, my son, I esteem you the more for these senti∣ments: but, I say again, it is time that you should think of doing something for your∣self.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Valen.</SPEAKER>
<P>No. I think only of you: I will burden myself with your labours; I will afflict myself with your griefs: my head, my hands, all that I have, all that I am, I give you. I devote myself entirely to you: whether you go, or remain, I will never quit you: you may fly me, but you shall not hinder my following you. When you hear me groaning the whole night, stretched at the door of your cottage, you will surely open it to me.</P>

<P>There is a grand coach just now stopped at the door, with four beautiful horses, and a number of fine folks all bedizened with lace, both before and behind, and a gentle∣man in it.

<P>What! this is the gentleman, then, to whom, as my father said, all that we have belongs.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, my child, we owe him a great deal of money, and as we have not half enough to discharge our debt, we are willing to do as much as we can, and give him up all our remaining property.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jenny.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what can he do with it? he has too fine a carriage to make use of our cart, and he is too well dressed to wear such clothes as we have.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is very true; but he will sell them and take the money; we have no other way of paying, and even that will not be sufficient.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jenny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you think that he will be so wicked as to treat us in such a cruel manner? if you had seen how good-natured he looked upon me—</P>

<P>It is a sad thing, however—let me take a last look at my holiday clothes. Could
<PB N="56" REF="60"/>you have thought, mother, last spring, when you gave me this jacket and petticoat, that I should wear them only two or three times?

<SPEAKER>Mr. Parks.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, so much the better. <STAGE>(He looks round the room.)</STAGE> But what does all this mean? one would imagine that you were going to have an auction here. Why all this linen and furniture piled up in this manner?</P>

<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is because we expected your com∣ing, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Parks.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>I told you this morning that we should not be able to pay our rent; it is therefore our duty to give you up what we have, and you see it collected here. With the sale of our furniture, clothes, and corn, we mean to pay you as far as we can. Whatever may be deficient, we will endeavour to earn by our labour, till we have paid to a far∣thing. I hope, Sir, you will at present, be
<PB N="60" REF="64"/>satisfied with this on account, and have a little patience for the rest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>As you have always been so indul∣gent to us—and, indeed, it is not by any fault of ours that we are in this distress.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>You know as well as myself, Sir, that I had drained the marshes in order to make them fit for pasture, and they were in a thriving way. All the money that we had remaining last year, we laid out in cattle, in order to fatten them for sale. Twenty head of good cattle was a little fortune, which promised fair to pay our rent, by sending a few of them off to market. A drought came on; there was scarcely a blade of grass in my fields: I fed my cattle with the straw of my bed, the thatch of my barn, and some∣times with the vegetables that were for my family's use. When I wanted to get rid of them, I could find no purchaser, owing to the scarcity of fodder. A murrain got amongst them, and I lost them all: I owe nothing, however, to any body but to you, Sir. Come and look at your grounds, you will see whether I have neglected to culti∣vate them; you will see if my own labour, with that of my wife and children, may not enable me one day to pay all my debts: I can, however, give you no other security
<PB N="61" REF="65"/>than my own word; but as I have always been punctual, till now, in my engagements with you, I should hope that you would have some reliance on my promise.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Parks.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, my friends, I do know you. Why should I not be content with the promise of such honest, worthy people as you are?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>I give you thanks, Sir; your kind words are still more pleasing than your good∣ness itself. How seldom will a creditor give the character of an honest man to the debtor by whom he has lost?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Parks.</SPEAKER>
<P>How seldom also does it hap∣pen, my friend Thorowgood, that a creditor can with truth say, that the debtor, by whom he has suffered, is worthy of that appellation?</P>

<PB N="65" REF="69"/>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Parks.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, my friend, you are sur∣prized, yet it is too true. When by folly and extravagance, ambitious and destructive schemes, people have put it out of their power to pay their debts, they transfer to their chil∣dren the property which they may have ob∣tained from the credulity and confidence of their creditors; and when the latter apply for payment, the parents possess nothing, and all that they seemed to have, is found in the hands of their children, who will not part with it.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho. </SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(with indignation.)</STAGE>
<P>What abomina∣ble knavery!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is horrible.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>And do the laws take no notice of these tricks?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Parks.</SPEAKER>
<P>Art and cunning find a way to silence them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your laws are as corrupt as those who stifle their voice, if they will not speak out on such occasions. Hear me, Sir; I am entirely ignorant of law proceedings; but I would not hesitate to say openly to that jus∣tice, which would submit to that restriction —Thou hast no farther business upon earth; be gone then to hell, where the wicked shall at last meet with due punishment. Were I the dupe of the father, I would go to the
<PB N="66" REF="70"/>children, and ask them, by what right they retained the property which ought to be re∣stored to me? If they should tell me, that they received it from their parents, my an∣swer would be, your parents could not be∣stow it on you; it belongs to me. I would compel them, without mercy, to sell the bed from under them in order to satisfy me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Parks.</SPEAKER>
<P>Matters are not carried on in that manner with us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>I would have them carried on in my way: such fathers and such children are no better than a knot of thieves.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Parks.</SPEAKER>
<P>The fathers are the most cri∣minal.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Sir, begging your pardon; the latter are still more so; the former are knaves, but the others are monsters. When a stranger hath relieved us in our distress, are we not in duty bound, whilst we have a drop of generous blood in our veins, to re∣lieve him in turn, if he should want our as∣sistance? and children, who owe every thing to their parents, have cost them so much anxiety, care and toil, shall they not act in the same manner? I shudder at the bare thought of such a thing; were I to see my father incapable of paying what he owed, though he had not left me a penny, I should
<PB N="67" REF="71"/>still think myself bound to fulfil all his en∣gagements. I should consider it as a duty of inheritance in me to acquit his memory, and preserve the integrity of his name. Though I were to live upon bread alone, to the last hour of my life, and be obliged to work the flesh from my bones, I would en∣deavour to pay all his debts; and when I had done so, I would go to his grave, and address him thus: Father, now rest in peace, thou owest nothing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Parks.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thou art a noble fellow, Thorowgood!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir, I would do so.—Gracious heaven! can we honor with the name of children those unnatural beings, who, rather than deprive themselves of some few com∣forts of life, would suffer their fathers to be treated like knaves?

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have always seen him behave in the same manner, Sir, as you do now: in all transactions his first object is to find out the side of justice; and when he has found it, he adheres to it, and will support it with all, and against all, beginning by himself. How∣ever, he is no more than what he ought to be.</P>

<P>Oh, Sir, you know but little of him;

<SPEAKER>Mr. Parks, </SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(surprized.)</STAGE>
<P>What, was it in∣cluded in the things that you were giving up? Would you have deprived your infant of a cradle?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar. </SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(coming forward.)</STAGE>
<P>Would he not al∣ways have found one in my arms?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Parks.</SPEAKER>
<P>And could you once think that would have accepted it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have already told you, Sir, that children should pay for their parents. When the one suffers, what pretence can the others have to refuse sharing in the affliction? There is nothing that I am not ready to do for my children; but, at the same time, there is nothing that I do not expect from them in return. My blood is theirs, as their blood is mine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Parks.</SPEAKER>
<P>What a man! how unshaken in his principles! <STAGE>(aside.)</STAGE> What you have taken, I give you: it is yours. Now you surrender the remainder to me, your house∣hold
<PB N="73" REF="77"/>goods, your clothes, corn, and the cattle that you have newly acquired? Do you trans∣fer all right and property in them to me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho. </SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(firmly.)</STAGE>
<P>We do, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>And without any regret.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>Rather say, with the greatest plea∣sure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar. </SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(drawing her purse out, and offering it to Mr. Parks.)</STAGE>
<P>Receive likewise all the money that we have.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Mr. Parks, (takes it, and throws it on the table.)</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>Won't you reckon it? There are five and twenty pounds.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Parks.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your word is sufficient. So you make me absolute master of all: and you are satisfied that I shall dispose of it as I please, without any opposition from you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>As it is now your property, we have no more title or claim to it than to your lands. We should be strange sort of folks, indeed, to assume the liberty of controlling you, in any respect, as to the disposal of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Parks.</SPEAKER>
<P>Consider well the conditions that you are laying on yourself. It is not my intention to extort this agreement from you; but once the matter is so settled—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! be not afraid that I shall attempt to recall my words. No, Sir, we are already
<PB N="74" REF="78"/>too sensible of your kindness in allowing us time: dispose of all things as you think pro∣per. We shall only beg of Heaven that all may prosper in your hands.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Parks.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now we understand one an∣other: then I acknowledge in turn that I have no farther claim upon you, being satis∣fied for all that you might be indebted to me, in consideration of your having surren∣dered up these effects.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho. </SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(with impatience.)</STAGE>
<P>But no, Sir, you would lose considerably; this will not amount to one half of your debt. Such a parcel of trumpery and rags for a hundred and fifty pounds!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Parks.</SPEAKER>
<P>But it is my pleasure to take them at that rate. Am not I at liberty to do this as I think proper?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have nothing to say as to that; yet I think it would be better to have them ap∣praised, in order to know exactly what they are worth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Parks.</SPEAKER>
<P>Peace, friend; they have a value in my eyes which no person on carth could possibly estimate. They are the fruits of the toil and frugality of an honest and wor∣thy family. When I reflect how many drops of sweat they must have cost you, I think them of value enough to make me the am∣plest
<PB N="75" REF="79"/>satisfaction. Now, my good friends, you owe me nothing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho </SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(taking off his hat.)</STAGE>
<P>Good Sir, how shall I thank you? <STAGE>(then turning about, be throws his arms round Martha's neck, and fondly embraces her.)</STAGE> Heaven be praised, my dear, we are no longer in debt!</P>
</SP>

<P>O matchless goodness! how shall we be ever able to shew our gratitude for so much generosity!</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>With our hearts, Martha; and there we have funds to discharge our obligations. <STAGE>(He advances towards Mr. Parks.)</STAGE> Will you now be so good as to tell me where we shall carry all these things, and when you will be pleased to have the keys delivered up.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Parks.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will tell you, provided you will forbear to interrupt me. <STAGE>(He takes both their hands, and addressing them with joy spark∣ling in his eyes,)</STAGE> My good friends, I am rich; and my parents taught me, from my infant years, to do good to the virtuous and wor∣thy; but I never, till this day, so fully expe∣rienced the exquisite delight of benevolent actions. My worthy Thorowgood
<STAGE>(squeez∣ing his hand)</STAGE> they behaviour hath filled me with esteem and admiration: all that thou hast made over to me to discharge thy debts, I restore to thee in turn, to acquit myself of a
<PB N="76" REF="80"/>duty which thy misfortunes and integrity claim from me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar. </SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(looking up to Heaven.)</STAGE>
<P>What then, shall I no longer be apprehensive of seeing my children in distress! O thou worthy, thou bounteous landlord! <STAGE>(She kisses his hand with emotion.)</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho. </SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(confounded almost to stupefaction.)</STAGE>
<P>I can scarcely believe what I have just now heard. No, Sir, it is impossible; and though these words may have escaped you in the en∣thusiastic emotions of your goodness, shall I be base enough to avail myself of them? No, no, I never will consent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Parks.</SPEAKER>
<P>Softly, softly, Thorowgood, you just now admitted that I was absolute master of your property, and perfectly at li∣berty to dispose of it agreeable to my own fancy; and would you now deprive me of these rights?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho. </SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(throwing himself at his feet.)</STAGE>
<P>Ah, Sir. you have seduced me into this; but why should I complain? Shall I receive bread from Heaven, and refuse it from you, whom it hath sent as a tutelary angel to relieve us in our distresses! Yes, I will become worthy of thy bounty, by receiving it as it is offered, with a soul full of joy and sensibility: but furnish me also with proper expressions to
<PB N="77" REF="81"/>thank you, <STAGE>(shedding a flood of tears.)</STAGE> I am afraid of not appearing sufficiently grateful for your favours.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Parks, </SPEAKER>

<P>Be comforted, Thorowgood; I see what is now passing at the bottom of your heart, perhaps, better than yourself, and am fully satisfied. Mar∣tha, call your children; I know with what tenderness they love you; I would fain let them see that I can love you also.</P>

<P>Come, my dear children, look round about you; all that you see there, you know we had given up to this gentleman, our landlord; well then, you must know that he has given it up to us back again; he will neither take our money, our corn, nor our cows; he acquits us of our whole debt for nothing.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Parks.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, my dear children, the ala∣crity which you have shewn in assisting your parents, has taught me how worthy you all are to be relieved in your afflictions: take back, then, all that you have given for them, but make that use of it to which your tender∣ness first prompted you. For example, Lu∣cy; as your father has lost his cattle, would you not be glad to employ what you have saved in buying others for him?</P>

<P>I should be curious to see how you and Jenny would behave on such an oc∣casion. Thorowgood, as you understand these matters better than your daughters, I commission you to go to-morrow to market for them, and buy for each of them six young heifers, the best that you can find. The mo∣ney will be ready to pay them at my house: it is a little present which I make your chil∣dren,

<P>Sir, I knew you very well to be a man of humanity, and a worthy man, but I was not sufficiently acquainted with all your virtues; and I am really at a loss how to be∣have to you. <STAGE>(To Martha.)</STAGE> O my beloved wife! oh that we could but comprise in one word, one single word, all that our hearts now feel! <STAGE>(Turning eagerly to Mr. Parks.)</STAGE> Sir, I will offer my prayers day and night to Heaven, not for you, no; one of your ac∣tions is beyond a thousand of my prayers; but that there may appear now and then upon earth, a few men like you, to preserve wretchedness from despair. <STAGE>(He takes Jenny and Lucy to the windows.)</STAGE> Don't you see, my children, that hill yonder, from the top of which there is a view of the city where
<PB N="80" REF="84"/>our benefactor resides: we go up it every Sunday in our way to church; well then, we never will ascend it without looking out for his place of abode, pouring out our bles∣sing upon it, and praying to Heaven for him, his wife, and all that belongs to him, before we go to pray for ourselves.

<P>We will begin as soon as we leave home.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir, every day and every mi∣nute; in the fields, or in our cottage, where∣soever we are, our first thoughts shall be de∣voted to you: we shall not be sensible of a moment of our existence, without reflecting that we enjoy it through your goodness, without being ready to lay it down for you at all times. You may, when you please, demand our blood, it is yours. Ah, why can I not at this moment pour every drop of mine into your veins, if it would but double the years of your life.</P>
</SP>

<P>Be happy, Thorowgood, con∣tinue the blessing of your wife, and bring up your children to think as you do. I will visit you sometimes to enjoy this pleasing sight; and, I am sure, I shall be the better for it.

<P>Indeed, I had formerly some excel∣lent wine always by me, which I kept for my father.

Do you remember, Martha, how happy the good old man used to be? My children, he would say, this wine strengthens and cheers me; but your affection, which makes you deny yourselves comforts for my sake,
<PB N="88" REF="92"/>strengthens and rejoices my heart still more: he was sometimes so much affected, that the tears flowed down his cheeks. You cannot conceive how exquisite the wine tasted to me, whilst I had my father drinking by my side. <STAGE>(Jenny comes in with two bottles.)</STAGE></P>

<P>Come, my son, look upon that good man; next to heaven and thy parents, it is to him that thou wilt owe the greatest obligations during life.

<P>And why so, my good boy?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George, </SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(taking Mr. Parks by the hand, and leading him to the window.)</STAGE>
<P>Come, Sir, and I will tell you the reason: do you see, near yonder hedge, an old apple tree that has scarcely any leaves on it? My mother was saying, this spring, that she was very sorry that the frost had injured it so much, for she had never eat so good apples, as it bore, in her life, and that the tree was like∣ly to die; the next morning, before she was up, my brother and I went to pick out the most flourishing buds we could see, in order to engraft them on other trees in the or∣chard,
<PB N="93" REF="97"/>that in case the old tree should perish, my mother might still have some good ap∣ples; had we left the farm, it would have been a sad thing; somebody else would have come into it, and in time have eaten of the fruit which we had engrafted.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Parks.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing could be easier than for you to have taken them with you, and then nobody would have benefited by your labour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why should I do so? that would have been no advantage; and though it were, I know very well that we ought not to seek an advantage to ourselves, that would be a prejudice to our fellow-crea∣tures: on the contrary, I should have wished them to gather good fruit from our trees.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Parks.</SPEAKER>
<P>But did you not just now say, that it would be a sad thing if others should eat the fruit which you had engrafted?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>Undoubtedly it would be a sad thing to me, that my mother should be de∣prived of it; for though I wish good apples to others, I had much rather my mother should have them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Parks.</SPEAKER>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is nothing like love and har∣mony in families. When my father and mother were living, all my study, night and day, was how I should please them best.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Parks.</SPEAKER>
<P>And where is his family?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>That we are as much strangers to as you are; we saved his life when he was an infant in the cradle; my wife suckled him, and he has always lived with us. He must
<PB N="97" REF="101"/>not have been of common origin; he had round his neck a coral, adorned with gold and jewels; and the linen he had on was of the finest kind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Parks.</SPEAKER>
<P>You preserved his life! you are ignorant of his family; and he is not of vulgar race! Ah, dear Thorowgood, quick∣ly tell me how he fell into your hands.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is a melancholy story:—We then lived in the north of England; I rented a farm there on the banks of a river; it was an excellent situation, and the land yielded abundantly;—no thanks to the care of the former tenant though—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Parks.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pass over these circumstances, pray, and only tell me all that relates to Va∣lentine; that alone inflames my curiosity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Sir, to come to the point at once; you must know, that one night we were roused from our sleep by the water's rushing into our house on all sides: we had hardly time to get upon the roof to wait for relief there: in the morning a boat came to our assistance; the whole country was under water; the river was covered with the ruins of houses and furniture, carried away by the force of the current. I was endeavouring to comfort my wife, who lamented the loss of our cottage, but still more that of her son,
<PB N="98" REF="102"/>who was stifled in the water before he awoke; in the mean time, I suddenly per∣ceived a cradle, tossed about in the flood, which was running rapidly, and threatening every moment to swallow it up. I could not bear the sight; I threw off my clothes, and, regardless of danger, I plunged into the river, swimming with all my might towards the cradle. I was driven back several times, and almost exhausted with fatigue; but the cries of the child, which I heard as I ap∣proached, inspired me with fresh spirits and vigour: in short, after much difficulty and danger, I got up to it, and brought it to the bank a good way lower down. My wife followed me creeping, more dead than alive, along the side of the river. I presented the infant to her, which continued crying until she gave it the breast. Poor Martha fancied that she had recovered her lost child. We then made all possible inquiries to see if we could discover the parents, but we never could get any information: our affliction at length ceased; we continued to look upon him as our own son. I have related the whole story to the boy himself a hundred times: I concealed it indeed from my own children, to let them enjoy the pleasure of thinking him their brother, and to avoid all
<PB N="99" REF="103"/>occasion of jealousy. I have had him in∣structed like the rest: he does his work as well as I can myself: he talks as if he were reading out of a book: and he can read and write as well as our schoolmaster.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Parks.</SPEAKER>
<P>And how long, pray, may it be since this happened?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>About fifteen years and a few months, as well as I can remember. But hold, I can tell you to a minute, for I had a me∣morial drawn up the magistrate of the place, signed by the rector, and attested by the peo∣ple, who were witnesses of the event. When I quitted the country, I took care to carry it with me. Go fetch it, Martha.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is here in this little box, with the clothes and coral which Valentine then had: we have kept them carefully, and put them by this morning; because, if you, Sir, had sold our effects, it would not have been just, that what belonged to the boy, should have gone with them.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mr. Parks.</SPEAKER>
<P>Most willingly, my friend, as the recital can no longer distress me: I had been married a year when a war broke out, and I received orders to proceed with my re∣giment to the West-Indies: my wife, not∣withstanding all entreaties, would accom∣pany me in that long and dangerous voyage, after giving birth to this dear boy, the only
<PB N="109" REF="113"/>one that we have left. I had an uncle, a dig∣nitary of the church, who lived near Dur∣ham; the infant was consigned to a nurse in his neighbourhood, that he might have an eye to him, and give us information about him. I received no account the three first years of my absence. Uneasy at so long a silence, I wrote to some friends in London: the most zealous of them visited the place, whence he acquainted me, that soon after my departure, a sudden inundation had ravaged the coun∣try, that my uncle had fallen a victim to his intrepid exertions on that calamitous occa∣sion; that the house of the nurse had been swept away by the flood, and that my son perished with her; this dreadful news op∣pressed me with sorrow, and almost broke my wife's heart. At my return to England, I was restrained from making any researches, which appeared useless, lest my ill success should revive those bitter sorrows which time had somewhat alleviated.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, for six years that I have been your tenant, and might have put an end to your grief! I shall never forgive myself for having suffered you to pine so long. I often told you of my happiness, why did you ne∣ver mention your sorrows to me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Parks.</SPEAKER>
<P>Could I have thought that
<PB N="110" REF="114"/>you alone were capable of terminating them! And besides, I must confess, that I endea∣voured all in my power to banish these sad reflections from my mind. I was particu∣larly fearful of reviving them in the com∣pany of my wife.

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do not flatter yourself with that ex∣pectation, Sir; he will make you shed tears as long as you live, but they will be tears of joy only. You are far from knowing him yet sufficiently: when you have observed all his excellent qualities, he will become a thousand times dearer to you. How happy it makes me to see you so worthy of each other!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Parks.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is to your instructions, my worthy friends, that I am indebted for his merit; it was under you he learned to relish sentiments of honour and virtue. I have the
<PB N="111" REF="115"/>comfort to find him exactly such as I would wish to have formed him myself. Ah, how shall I be able to reward you as I ought!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>Reward us! Oh, that he has done a long time since; Valentine himself has taken care of that: night and day he has laboured all inches power for our benefit. Do you imagine that without his care and toil our fields would have prospered as they have done?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Parks.</SPEAKER>
<P>You will have a heavy loss, then, in losing his assistance?</P>

<SP>

<P>Alas! it is the satisfaction of his so∣ciety that we shall have most cause to regret.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Valen.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, father it is but right to tell you of what they, perhaps, would conceal, lest they might again interest your generosity of heart; all my efforts were due to them for their care and tenderness to me in my infant years, and I had no merit in working for them; but as industrious as they are, my hands were necessary to them: if they lose my assistance, it is my duty to make them a compensation—there is but one method: luckily it depends on the first favour I have to solicit at your hands, and you will not surely refuse me in this joyful and happy moment; will you, father?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Parks.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, my son; speak out; ask;
<PB N="112" REF="116"/>there is nothing that you have not a right to obtain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Valen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, then, I entreat you to give them those lands for me, since I am no lon∣ger to assist in cultivating them.</P>

<P>What say'st thou, Va∣lentine?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Parks.</SPEAKER>
<P>What does he say? Ah, what fills my heart with rapture, as it proves to me that he is full of gratitude. Yes, my son; now am I certain of soon possessing thy affection, since I see thee so sensible of the tenderness that these worthy people had for you. Thorowgood, receive this farm from the hands of our son. I will not rob him of the joy that he feels in bestowing it upon you. I will only add for myself and my wife, the tenement that Humphries occu∣pies, which is yours from this moment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>Forbear, Sir, pray forbear: spare us; do not quite overwhelm us. How shall we be ever capable of discharging our obli∣gations? you will make us ungrateful, in spite of ourselves.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Parks.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do not then begin to be so, by robbing me of the joy with which I re∣ceive the present that you have made me. Is not a son a thousand times more valuable than the lands that I leave you? Speak, an∣swer me.
<PB N="113" REF="117"/>Would you give your own for any such consideration?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have always the art to confound and silence me, therefore I will leave you to act as you please: it would be criminal in us to combat your kindness. <STAGE>(He turns to Mar∣tha.)</STAGE> This morning we were unable my dear, to pay half our debts, and now we overflow with riches. O my children, I may now die without being anxious about you; and whilst I lose you, Valentine, I see you provided with a father worthy of you! I am afraid my poor brains will be turned with excess of joy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Parks.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, Thorowgood, drink a glass of wine to settle them.</P>
</SP>

<P>So much the bet∣ter, my dear; I wish them to feel it in their heads, that they may always remember this

When they shall hereafter reflect on all that he has done for them, they will give him back, for every drop of wine, a thousand tears of gratitude and tenderness. Excuse them, good Sir, they are not yet of an age to comprehend the boundless extent of your favours; but let them grow up, as long as they live, you shall be blessed by them and their children.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Valen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I dare answer for them; I know their excellent hearts. O, my dear little sisters, and you my brother, I shall ne∣ver forget your kindness to me! <STAGE>(He embracrs them.)</STAGE> Father, you will permit me to hus∣band my pocket-money, and save what I can to give them to settle in the world.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>How could I deny you what seems to give you so much pleasure? Yes, I agree to it for you as much as for myself. I sti∣pulate, however, one condition, which I shall propose to Mr. Parks.</P>

<P>Let us hear what it is.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have often told me that you and my lady wished for a little retreat in these parts, to pass the summer in. The neigh∣bouring land is to be sold; you may buy it, and build a lodge to your own mind; by these means we shall have you near us for half the year. I would lay my life that Va∣lentine would grow melancholy, if he were always to be cooped up in the city.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Parks.</SPEAKER>
<P>What say you to this, my son?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Valen.</SPEAKER>
<P>I should be heartily glad of it, I must own; I like dearly the air of the coun∣try.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Parks, </SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(with a smile.)</STAGE>
<P>Be it so then. You see, Thorowgood, I am more ready to comply with your desire than you were with mine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because there is some difference; but I have not done; the ground is extensive enough to allow good gardens. Look at me, Sir: you do not yet now all that I am ca∣pable of doing: I was formerly a gardener, and have not yet forgotten my old trade: I take upon myself to lay out the garden in such a manner, that people shall come far and near to view it as a curiosity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will undertake to dig the canals and trenches, to make the terrace, and plant the trees of your walk.</P>
</SP>

<P>And I and my girls will make the borders, and plant them with flowers.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mr. Parks.</SPEAKER>
<P>What do you mean, my friends? I must then till your grounds, whilst you are at work in my garden.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>I guessed that you would still be so unkind as to oppose me. Hear me, Sir; we shall be more expeditious in our work; and besides, the best time for working in your garden is precisely the season when there is scarcely any thing to be done in the fields. Though Valentine be now a person of con∣sequence, still I hope that he will not refuse his assistance: his hands are used to the ma∣nagement of the spade; and to work for you will be the greatest pleasure to him. Only let us have our own way: every one will work cheerfully, and the whole will be finished before you have time to think about it. But here comes the worthy Humphries.

<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, my friend, how happy am I that I now have it in my power to acknowledge your honesty to me this morning! Consider what you would have gained by following the advice of a bad man: for two paltry cows, which you might have retained, you would have lost a valuable friend: my little fortune would have made you mad with en∣vy and rage. On seeing me the owner of your tenement, you would have been in con∣tinual dread of being turned out by me through revenge. That idea would have em∣bittered your life; instead of that, you have now in me a friend, that will stand by you on all occasions. It will give me the greatest pleasure to serve you: I can begin this mo∣ment. I return you the two cows you sent me, and I hold you exempt from paying any rent for two years.</P>
</SP>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Parks.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thought nothing could have

<P>Ah, Sir, it would ill become me to profit by your favours, and not benefit like∣wise by your example. It is you that have enabled me to oblige my neighbour; and I thank you for this additional pleasure.</P>

<SPEAKER>Hum. </SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(recovering himself, and taking Tho∣rowgood by the hand.)</STAGE>
<P>Ah, my friend, how shall I become worthy of your kindness! no∣thing pains me so much as that I have it not in my power to shew my gratitude.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>What do you say, Humphries? God preserve me from doing service to others with the view of having it returned! To do good is a wonderful thing, that carries along with it its best reward.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hum.</SPEAKER>
<P>Heaven will bless you in your wife, your children, and all your undertakings; and, for my part, I shall never think of you but with eyes overflowing with the tenderest tears. I already wish you happier than my∣self. I am only jealous of one thing; it is of the honour that Mr. Parks has done you in dining with you. Hear me: I have a fat lamb that I was going to sell, it shall now
<PB N="120" REF="124"/>serve to renew our friendship. Mr. Parks, you Martha, and your children, must all come and eat part of it to-morrow.</P>

<P>That is true. But if my suspi∣cions are right, and if the little that he can know has made him vain, I would rather a hundred times that he knew nothing, and were modest.</P>

<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f ever you should have a farm, do you think that it would be of no service to you to have an early notion of the labours of the country, to learn to distinguish trees and plants, to know the times of sowing and harvest, and to study the wonders of vegeta∣tion?

You ought to think yourself very happy in having so amiable a companion, with whom you may at once amuse and improve yourself. His father is my foster-brother, and has always had a re∣markable affection for me. I am pretty sure that Michael has the same for you.

<P>Yes, madam, about ten minutes ago I saw him turn towards the grove.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. W.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, my dear, whence comes this indifference about your son?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. W.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you think, my dear, that I love him less than you do? No, but I know better how to love him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs W.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what if he could not be found?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. W.</SPEAKER>
<P>I should be very glad of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs W.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, that he should pass the night in a gloomy wood? What would be∣come of the poor child? and what would be∣come of me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. W.</SPEAKER>
<P>You would both be cured. He of his vanity, and you of your injudicious fondness which keeps it up in him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. W.</SPEAKER>
<P>What do you mean, my dear?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. W.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am just now convinced of what I only suspected in the morning. The boy's head is filled with excessive vanity, and all his reading is but ostentation. He has only
<PB N="132" REF="136"/>lost himself on purpose to make us look for him, and to appear absent and forgetful through intense study. It gives me more pain that his mind should wander from a right way of thinking than if his steps really went astray. He will be unhappy all his life if he is not cured of it in time, and there is nothing but a wholesome humiliation that can save him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. W.</SPEAKER>
<P>But do you consider—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. W.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, every thing. He is eleven years old. If he can profit any thing by his natural sense or his learning, the light of the moon and the direction of the wind may guide him sufficiently to clear the wood.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. W.</SPEAKER>
<P>But if he has not that thought?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. W.</SPEAKER>
<P>He will then better see the ne∣cessity of profiting by the lessons that I have given him upon this subject. Besides, we intend him for the army, and in that profes∣sion he will have many nights to pass with∣out shelter. He will know what it is, and not go to a camp quite raw, to be laughed at by his companions. Then the air is not very cold at this season of the year, and for one night he will not die with hunger. Since by his folly he has brought himself into a scrape, let him get out of it again, or suffer the disagreeable consequences of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. W.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; I cannot agree to it; and
<PB N="133" REF="137"/>if you don't send people after him, I will go myself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. W.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, my dear, I will make you easy, though I am sorry that you will not let me follow my plan, as I intended. I shall tell litle Michael to join him as it were by chance. Colin too shall be at a small dis∣tance, in order to run to them in case of an accident. For any thing more, do not ask it; I have taken my resolution, and do not chuse, by a blind weakness, to deprive my son of a lesson that may be of service to him. Here are our friends coming back with Mar∣tin.</P>

<PB N="149" REF="153"/>

<P>Good, indeed! you have no occasion to look exactly like a king. And active as you are, the throne might possibly cause your majesty a tumble.</P>

<P>Why, to say the truth, I have read of many tumbles of that nature in my an∣cient history.</P>
</SP>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Younger Danby, </SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(stuttering.)</STAGE>
<P>Yes, indee∣deed! It pains me sti-still a little, and that ma-a-aster Roberts is a very nau-au-aughty boy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Does he design to come to-night?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Elder Danby.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope not: if we had ex∣pected him here, we should not have stirred out.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Younger Danby.</SPEAKER>
<P>He o-o-only thinks of mis-mischief.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>What has he done then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Elder Danby.</SPEAKER>
<P>We were both going out last Saturday. I stopped to get a handkerchief: my brother went down stairs alone, and, as it happened, Roberts hearing some one, came out slily, jumped at once upon my brother, who was frighted, lost his footing, and rolled down the stairs from top to bottom.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>Poor Danby! I am sorry for you.
<PB N="150" REF="154"/>Roberts looks for all the world as if he loved such mischief. We shall have his company this evening for the first time in our lives, his father begged papa to let him come and see us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Elder Danby.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sorry for it; for we do not speak to one another.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>My papa supposed you all good friends, because you lodge together, and con∣sidered that you would have the greater plea∣sure if he came.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Elder Danby.</SPEAKER>
<P>The greater pleasure! We should like to have him ten miles off. Since he has been our neighbour, we are continu∣ally uneasy. He has frequently amused him∣self with breaking windows, and then tried to lay the blame on us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>Does no one complain about him to his father?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Elder Danby.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! I do not know what to make of him, he is such an odd sort of a man! He scolds a little, pays the damage, and that is all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>If I were your papa, I would quit my lodgings, and live somewhere else.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Elder Danby.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, so he means to do, and therefore yesterday gave warning; and now we are forbidden all manner of connection with this Roberts, he is so wicked! Would you think it, very few go by the house, with∣out
<PB N="151" REF="155"/>being apprehensive that he will put some trick upon them. Sometimes he diverts him∣self by squirting puddle water at them, or else pelting them with rotten apples. Nay, he will sometimes fasten rabbits tails or bits of rags behind their backs, at which the people, when they see it, all burst out a laughing. Then too he has what he calls his <HI>caxen fishery.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>Caxen fishery!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Elder Danby.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes: he will take the peo∣ple's wigs off, as they pass him, with a hook, as you would carp. When any poor man stops before his window to converse with an acquaintance, Roberts immediately goes up to the balcony, with a string suspended from a fishing-rod, and at the end of it a hook, with which he jerks the poor man's wig off. Then he runs and ties it to a dog that he has before provided for the purpose, after which he drives the creature out into the street, and off he sets that instant, so that the poor perri∣wig has frequently been dragged for twenty minutes through the mud, before its owner can lay hold of it again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>But this is more than mere amuse∣ment!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Elder Danby.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet this is nothing to the stories that I could tell you. Why, he lames or bruises all the dogs and cats that
<PB N="152" REF="156"/>come within his reach. Nor is it long ago, when one of his relations broke a leg, by slipping down upon the stairs where Roberts had been scattering peas on purpose. Ay, it is so; or else our name is not Danby. And for the servants, I am sure, his father would not get one to attend him, if he did not pay extraordinary wages.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>Shall I tell you now? I long to see him. I like boys a little merry.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Elder Danby.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing is more natural: but Roberts's mirth is not like other chil∣dren's. You, I know, love laughing in your heart; but would not, for the world, hurt any one; whereas this wicked fellow laughs at bumps and bruises.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, that does not fright me in the least. I shall be much more pleased in pay∣ing him as he deserves.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Elder Danby.</SPEAKER>
<P>If he should come, my bro∣ther will not offend you by withdrawing? He would do him some fresh mischief.</P>

<P>Ye-ye-yes, I will go.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, a truce to compliments. As mistress of the house, it is necessary that I

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, I know them very well. This here is
<STAGE>(pointing to Alice)</STAGE> my lady—what is her name? Pentweazle, that will take you off the company, as simple as she seems: and there is
<STAGE>(pointing to Laura, and limping round the room)</STAGE> Miss Up-and-down, who broke her leg by running from the rod. This gentleman, <STAGE>(Elder Danby)</STAGE> observe him, he is a grave wise Grecian, who looks strait before him when he walks, as if he pitied us poor silly children. And this other good little friend of mine
<STAGE>(pointing to younger Danby, and letting fall his hat)</STAGE> is Pe-pe-peter Grievous, whose dear mama forgot, poor creature! to untie his tongue when he was born. <STAGE>(The children seem surprized, and stare at one an∣other.)</STAGE></P>

<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>And who am I, sir, for methinks you seem quite clever at this sort of portrait painting?</P>

<SPEAKER>Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, I am not sufficiently ac∣quainted with you yet, to take your likeness: but I shall let you have it soon.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>For you, sir, I could draw you at a<PB N="157" REF="161"/>glance, and I must tell you, the similitude would not be very pleasing. I could never have supposed it possible that any well bred little gentleman, as I imagine you affect to be, should think of turning natural defects into a theme for banter. If my little friends were not sincerely such, they would have reason to reproach me for exposing them to your indecency. But they can see that I could not have expected half so much my∣self.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Frank, I protest your sister is mighty eloquent. You need not go to church on Sundays, having such a charming preacher in the house.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>She has tolerable skill, when any one is to be told the truth; and therefore both my sister Isabella and I love her sincerely.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well, you see I have tole∣rable skill likewise in telling truth; and therefore no doubt you will love me, too, sin∣cerely. <STAGE>(He bows to Lucy.)</STAGE> I ask your par∣don, miss, for having taken the employment out of your hands, as you are yourself so cle∣ver at it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your excuses and your bow are both an insult; but an insult such as I despise. Though, were they on the other hand sin∣cere, they would hardly make atonement for so coarse an incivility. If I had not consi∣dered
<PB N="158" REF="162"/>every word that you said as meant in joke, however gross I cannot but suppose it, I should know what suited me to do, and should have done it likewise. Let me there∣fore beg, sir, that you will indulge in no more freedoms of this nature, if you mean that we should remain together.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Roberts, </SPEAKER>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>So you call them idiots, do you, since they are not mischievous?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="163" REF="167"/>
<SPEAKER>Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, you are mighty formal and precise. Then shall I mention something else?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I have some thread as strong as whipcord in my pocket. I will thread one of these great needles with a little of it; and as soon as they are all come down, one of us shall go up very politely towards them, make a deal of scraping, and wry faces, while the other, keeping still behind, shall sew their gowns together. They will all want to dance, as you may guess; so up we will come, and take them out.—Ha! ha! you know the rest; ha! ha! ha! ha! ha!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, to tear their gowns, and get them anger when their parents find it out?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why there is the fun.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! have you no pleasure then in any thing but doing mischief?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>But is does not hurt me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>O ho! I understand: you think of no one but yourself, and all the world is no∣thing to you!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well; but we are come together to divert ourselves, and we must positively have some laughing. So suppose we frighten Laura and the least Danby?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>But that is quite wrong. Suppos∣ing any one should frighten you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="164" REF="168"/>
<SPEAKER>Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>With all my heart, if any one is but able. I am afraid of nothing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank. </SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(aside.)</STAGE>
<P>Say you so?—That we shall see, perhaps.— <STAGE>(Aloud to Roberts.)</STAGE> Well, about this frightening?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have an ugly mask at home. I will run and fetch it. And do you, when I am gone, contrive to bring the little children down, and you shall see—I will not be ab∣sent half a minute.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank, </SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(aside.)</STAGE>
<P>Good!—There shall be a better mask ready for you, though!— <STAGE>To Ro∣berts, calling him back.</STAGE> But Roberts! Ro∣berts!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is the matter?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>It will be better that we should come upon them where we are, if I can bring the others down; for when there are but two or three in this part of the house, there some∣times comes a spirit; and in that case, we ourselves should be but badly off.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is all this story of a spirit?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, it is true. At first one hears a noise, and then a phantom with a lighted torch glides by, and then the room seems all on fire. <STAGE>(He draws back, as if afraid.)</STAGE> Oh! methinks I see it now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Roberts, </SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(a little frightened.)</STAGE>
<P>See what?— O dear!—And what can bring the phantom here?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="165" REF="169"/>
<SPEAKER>Frank. </SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(drawing Roberts towards a corner, and then whispering to him.)</STAGE>
<P>The reason, as we are told, is this: There was a mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er who lived here formerly, and he was robbed one night of all his money: in despair he cut his throat, and now from time to time his ghost goes up and down—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Roberts, </SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(in a tremble.)</STAGE>
<P>O ho! I will stay no longer here, unless you get more company.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>But recollect how brave you were just now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>You must not fancy I am afraid: —but—but—but—but—but I will go and fetch my mask.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do, do; and I will prepare things here.—What pleasure we shall have!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Roberts. </SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(with a grin.)</STAGE>
<P>Oh! enough to make one die with laughing!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>They will be finely frightened!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>That they will! and therefore I will make haste. I am at home and back again—you shall see how soon! <STAGE>(He goes out.)</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank, </SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(close.)</STAGE>
<P>Ah! ah! you want to frighten others, and are not afraid yourself! Well, well, I have thought of something that will frighten you, or I am very much mistaken.</P>

<STAGE>Frank, Lucy, Isabella, Dorinda, Alice, Elder Danby.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>We saw Master Roberts run across the street this moment—What is the mat∣ter? Have you had a quarrel?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>On the contrary, he thinks me his best friend. I have seemed willing to go shares with him in a trick that he means to put upon the little ones above; but it is him∣self that he will trick, and never wish to come here a third time.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, what is your project?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>You shall know very soon. At present I have no time to lose, for every thing must be in readiness against his coming back: so, ladies, I request permission to be absent for about five minutes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dorinda.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, go, go: but do not stay longer. We are all impatient to be told what you design.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall consider it my duty to in∣form you when I have finished my prepara∣tions. So once more with your leave. I will come again in less, perhaps, than five mi∣nutes. <STAGE>(He goes out.)</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! ah! ah!—Two pretty fellows together! We shall see what good comes out between them! They are well matched.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="167" REF="171"/>
<SPEAKER>Elder Danby.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! for Heaven's sake, Miss Lucy, do not do such dishonour to my friend, your brother, as to name him and that wicked Roberts together.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alice.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are in the right, Danby. One is nothing but politeness, and the other quite a savage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Isabella.</SPEAKER>
<P>Savage as he is, however, I would lay a wager that Frank will be found his master.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dorinda.</SPEAKER>
<P>What a piece of service Frank would do us, could he clear the house of such a fellow! We shall have no pleasure all the evening if he stays among us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am afraid, however, Frank will proceed too far, and think himself permitted to do any thing against this Roberts.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Elder Danby.</SPEAKER>
<P>He can never do enough; and though his scheme should be a little hard on Roberts, there will be instruction in it: it is the greatest service that one can do him: and his father, I am persuaded, will be pleas∣ed with Frank, when he hears what pains he has taken to instruct his son. Alas! he would part with half his fortune to have Ro∣berts like him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alice.</SPEAKER>
<P>So, Lucy, do not you go about to thwart your brother's good intentions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, my dear Miss Alice, I am in a ticklish situation: I am now instead of my
<PB N="168" REF="172"/>mama, and cannot possibly let any thing go forward that she would not approve.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let him have his way. We will take the blame of what he does upon ourselves.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Isabella.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, let him sister. War, I say, war; war for ever with the wicked!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank, </SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(returning joyfully.)</STAGE>
<P>I have settled every thing, and Roberts may appear when∣ever he thinks proper. We will receive him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, I hope, you will tell me—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dorinda.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, we will be in the plot too: and more than that, assist you if we can.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, ladies, that is not necessary. There is a little violence, I must acknow∣ledge, in my plot, and therefore I will not make you parties. I have been settling every thing with Ralph in the stable. He conceives my meaning clearly, and will second it with great dexterity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>But still, you do not acquaint me—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is all of the contrivance that you need know. We will go to Blind-man's Buff, that Roberts may suspect no harm on his return. I will let myself be caught, and he or she that blinds me must take care that I may have an opportunity of seeing through the handkerchief, and fixing upon Roberts. After he is blinded, you shall steal into the closet, take away the lights, and leave us both together. When I want your aid, I will call you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="171" REF="173"/>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is master Roberts; but he was not in the play. You must begin again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>Undoubtedly, Frank is right.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dorinda.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, be it so; but if I catch you again, it shall be all fair. Remember, I have warned you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>O yes, yes. <STAGE>(He takes Frank aside, and lets him see a little of the mask.)</STAGE> What think you of it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank, </SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(feigning to be frightened.)</STAGE>
<P>O how fright∣ful! I should certainly be terrified at seeing it my∣self. Well, hide it carefully: we will play a little, and then slip away.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Roberts, </SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(whispering Frank.)</STAGE>
<P>Yes, yes, we will: but I must, first of all, do something to teize the ladies.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank, </SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(whispering Roberts.)</STAGE>
<P>I will go up to Dorinda, and turn her round: if she should catch me, she will suppose it to be you, and must set out again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Roberts, </SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(whispering Frank.)</STAGE>
<P>Good! good! I will have a little sun with her too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well; when will you have told each other all your secrets? Two fine gentlemen! why, do not you see, the game stands still?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>You need not stay for us; we are ready.</P>

<P>Now, Miss Dorinda, I will put myself into your way.</P>
</SP>
<P><HI>(Roberts brings a chair, and puts it so that Dorinda may tumble over it; but Frank takes it away, and puts himself instead, upon his hands and feet, with so much noise, that Dorinda may hear him. As she slides

<P>Yes, indeed; I am taken. What ill luck! so soon?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dorinda, </SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(pulling off the bandage.)</STAGE>
<P>O, ho! you wanted to throw me down! I thought nobody but master Roberts played such tricks; but it shall not be long before I take revenge. <STAGE>(She covers Frank's eyes, so that he can see a little, leads him to∣wards the middle of the room, and, as is the custom of the game, asks him,)</STAGE> How many horses in your father's stable?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>Three; black, white, and grey.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dorinda.</SPEAKER>
<P>Turn about three times, and catch whom you may. <STAGE>(Frank gropes about, and lets him∣self be josiled as they please. Dorinda particularly plagues him; he pretends to follow her, but all at once turns round, and falls on Roberts.)</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! ha! I have caught you! have I? It is a boy. It is Roberts! <STAGE>(pulling of the hand∣kerchief.)</STAGE> Yes, yes; I am not mistaken.</P>

<P>Why lay hold on <HI>me?</HI></P>

<STAGE>(to Frank.)</STAGE>
<P>Do, and you shall see how I will make him squeak: I will pinch him till the very blood comes. <STAGE><HI>(Frank covers Roberts's eyes, and nods to the company as he had settled it.

<P>Well: have you finished? Oh make haste. You take a

<P>Turn about— <STAGE>(pretending to be angry with the others.)</STAGE> Be quiet pray, young ladies, and not quit your places till the game is begun.—Turn about three times, and catch whom you may.— <STAGE>(While Roberts turns about, Frank runs for the speak∣ing trumpet, bids the groom untie a chain that he has about his waist, which falling makes a hideous noise, and then he cries out lustily himself,)</STAGE> The ghost! the ghost! Run, Roberts, for your life. 
<STAGE>(He claps the door to violently, hides himself behind the Groom, and speaking through the trumpet, says,)</STAGE> 
It is you then that come to steal my treasure?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Roberts, </SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(trembling with fear, and not daring to pull off the bandage.)</STAGE>
<P>Fire! fire! Danby! Where are you, Frank! Murder! murder! Dorinda!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank, </SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(speaking through the trumpet.)</STAGE>
<P>I have seared them all away. Pull off your bandage, and look at me. <STAGE>(Roberts, without pulling off the bandage, puts his hands up to his face, retiring from the ghost.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pull it off, I say— <STAGE>(Roberts pulls the ban∣dage down about his neck, but dare not lift his eyes up, and at last, when he observes the ghost, he screams out, and has not power to move.)</STAGE></P>

<P>What, sir, is this the sample that you give us of your behaviour, the first time you set foot within my doors?

You have been disrespectful to these ladies, whom I need not say you should have honoured and regarded. So be gone!

I will not permit your detestable example to corrupt my children. Go, and never let me see you here again! <STAGE>(Ro∣berts is confounded, and withdraws.)</STAGE> And you, my friends, although the circumstances of the case may very possibly excuse what you have done, yet never, for the time to come, indulge your∣selves in such sport. The fears which have power to affect children at a tender age, may possibly be followed by the worst consequences during their whole life.
