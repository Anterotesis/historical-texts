<LG>
<L>AWAKE, my Muse, whate'er thy Name may be,</L>
<L>Or sprung from heav'nly seed, or low degree,</L>
<L>Whether thou equal'st <HI>Garth</HI>'s majestic rage,</L>
<L>Or crawl'st, like <HI>Blackmore,</HI> thro' the drowsy Page,</L>
<L>Much it imports the Bus'ness to explain <MILESTONE N="5"/></L>
<L>That shook the puny state of <HI>Warwick-Lane:</HI></L>
<L>Then, thrice-invok'd, expand thy raven's wing,</L>
<L>Vast is the task, for thou hast much to sing.</L>

<L>Tho' no <HI>Degree</HI> thy equal merit raise,<MILESTONE N="10"/></L>
<L>Yet shall your skill to latest times indure,</L>
<L>Like <HI>Graduates</HI> oft you kill, like them you sometimes cure.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Twas now the day when Fellows, Fellows meet,</L>
<L>To talk of weighty matters, then to eat;</L>
<L>Mean while the Patient, from his tyrant free,<MILESTONE N="15"/></L>
<L>Inhales fresh health, and lives without a Fee.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>First <HI>BATTUS</HI> came, deep-read in worldly art,</L>
<L>Whose tongue ne'er knew the secrets of his heart;</L>
<L>In mischief mighty, tho' but mean of size,</L>
<L>And, like the <HI>Tempter,</HI> ever in disguise.<MILESTONE N="20"/></L>

<PB N="4" REF="3"/>
<L>See him with aspect grave, and gentle tread,</L>
<L>By slow degrees, approach the sickly bed:</L>
<L>Then at his Club behold him alter'd soon,</L>
<L>The solemn Doctor turns a low Buffoon:</L>
<L>And he, who lately in a learned freak <MILESTONE N="25"/></L>
<L>Poach'd ev'ry <HI>Lexicon,</HI> and publish'd <HI>Greek,</HI></L>
<L>Still madly emulous of vulgar Praise,</L>
<L>From <HI>Punch</HI>'s forehead wrings the dirty bays.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But who is that whose gogling Eye-balls scowl,</L>
<L>Like the full Orbs of the <HI>Cecropian</HI> fowl?<MILESTONE N="30"/></L>
<L>Hail, <HI>POCUS,</HI> Hail!—Ye Midwives, sound his fame!</L>
<L>Ye Nurses, sing in Lullabies his Name!</L>
<L>'Tis his to ease from pangs the lab'ring wife,</L>
<L>And tug the little Offspring into life.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As blind <HI>Tiresias,</HI> on a luckless day,<MILESTONE N="35"/></L>
<L>Lost his first Sex, as antient Poets say;</L>
<L>So purring <HI>POCUS,</HI> once scarce known to fame,</L>
<L>Of an unskilful Leach, a Matron grave became.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Him <HI>Granta</HI> saw, and bade her learned Vest</L>
<L>Bind his broad Shoulders, and embrace his Chest; <MILESTONE N="40"/></L>
<L>Yet never quaff'd he of her sacred stream,</L>
<L>No Muse inspiring waits his morning dream.</L>
<L>The Scarlet Robe its heavy Wearer mocks;</L>
<L>So sits a Racer's Saddle on an Ox.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As he pass'd by, a num'rous tribe succeeds,<MILESTONE N="45"/></L>
<L>Thick as in standing corn the purple weeds;</L>
