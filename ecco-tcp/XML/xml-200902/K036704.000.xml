<HEAD>PROLOGUE,</HEAD>
<BYLINE>WRITTEN BY T. W. FITZGERALD, Esq. Spoken by Mr. Macready.</BYLINE>
<SP>
<L>WHEN invalids possess both faith and wealth,</L>
<L>They'll find a nostrum to restore their health;</L>
<L>A <HI>panacea</HI> advertis'd to cure</L>
<L>Each ill the human body can endure.</L>
<L>But our bold Author claims a nobler art,</L>
<L>And advertises to relieve—the heart.</L>
<L>So many patients he expects to see,</L>
<L>That I'm appointed as his deputy.</L>
<L>Now, then, your mental maladies explain,</L>
<L>And I'll remove or mitigate the pain.</L>
<L>Does love or jealousy your peace molest,</L>
<L>Revenge inflame, ambition gnaw your breast?</L>
<L>For jealousy, a sovereign balm behold,—</L>
<L>The husband's certain cure, a pill of gold;</L>
<L>This dose, administer'd with prudent care,</L>
<L>Dispels at once the frailties of the fair;</L>
<L>Deprives the proctor of his <HI>crim. con.</HI> fee,</L>
<L>And tunes the chord that jar'd to harmony.</L>
<L>Should love torment some Romeo's heated brain,</L>
<L>Or agonize a Juliet's breast with pain,</L>
<L>Let them my potent remedy apply,—</L>
<L>The maid shall cease to pine, the youth to sigh;</L>
<L>Gold shall restore each drooping lover's health,</L>
<L>And passion sind a substitute in wealth.</L>
<L>But let not ill-tim'd ridicule degrade</L>
<L>What Heav'n, when well applied, a blessing made.</L>
<L>To foster merit, wheresoever found,</L>
<L>And with improvement cheer a country round;</L>
<L>To feed the hungry, and to clothe the poor,</L>
<L>And send the beggar happy from the door;</L>
<L>To mitigate the horrors of despair,</L>
<L>And make the family of want our care;</L>
<L>To succour genius, drooping in distress,</L>
<L>Making the business of our lives to bless.</L>
<L>When the rich man can such employment find,</L>
<L>We wish his purse as ample as his mind.</L>
<L>For one poor patient I've an anxious fear;</L>
<L>And you must be his kind physician here.</L>
<L>Our Author has to night so much at stake,</L>
<L>He finds his throbbing heart inclin'd to ache!</L>
<L>But should his play a lib'ral audience please,</L>
<L>Your warm applause will set his heart at ease.</L>

<P>I have reason, Frank. I have just received a letter from my dear Edward, who has left London on business with his father, Mr. Rapid, and will be here to day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>I suppose it to be a desperate long letter, and cruel sweet. Full of kisses and voluntines.— Nine sheets, I warrant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jessy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hardly nine words. The truth is, that Edward, tho' handsome, generous, and I hope sin¦ce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> is impatient and hasty to a degree that—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hasty! What then? when a man be on the road to do good, he can't go too fast, I say.— Bean't that Feyther coming thro' Wheat Ash? he have been drinking and gamestring all good Sunday night wi' Nabob's servants,—how whitish and deadly bad he do look. He us'd to be as comely and handsome as either of us, wasn't he now? Do you know, Jessy, at church yesterday, Sir Hubert, looking round, as he always do to see if his tenants be there, missed Feyther, and gave me such a desperate look, that I dropt prayer book out of my hand; and truly when Fey∣ther do go to church I be always sham'd he never knows where to fin the collect—never—I'm sure it be not my fault, he be so full of prodigality—
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>never son set Feyther better example than I do's mine; what can I do more for 'un? it would not be becoming in me to leather Feather, would it, Jessy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jessy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Here he comes, I'll return to my garden— to converse with him is to me dreadful; for, while my breast rises with indignation at his conduct as a man, it sinks again in pity for the misfortunes of a parent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now that's just like I—I feels as if I should like to lick 'un, and cry all the time—But what will be the end on't, Jessy?</P>

<P>Ruin, inevitable ruin!</P>

<P>Well don't thee be cast down—thee knows I be cruel kind to thee; at meals I always gis thee the desperate nice bits, and if thy lover prove false hearted, or Feyther should come to de∣cay, I be a terrible strong lad, I'll work for thee fra sunrise to down, and if any one offer to harm thee, I'll fight for thee till I die.</P>

<P>I don't know, ma'am—upon my soul—I beg pardon, but really the Baronet's house is horrid vulgar, compared to your uncle's, the Na∣bob's here; I peeped thro' my glass into an old hall, and beheld fifty paupers at dinner, such wretches! and the Baronet himself walking round the table to see them properly fed.—How damn'd low!—Ugh!

Charles, when we parted last at Spa; how great the contrast; thy animated form was prison'd in the icy fetters of disease; thy pale and quiv'ring lip refused a last adieu;—But ah! a smile that seemed borrowed from a seraph who waited to bear thee up to Heaven, swore for thee everlasting love. That smile supported me in solitude,—but to solitude I have now bade adieu, and to be near the lord of my heart, have again enter'd this house, the palace of ruinous luxury and licentious madness; but here comes its whimsical proprietor.</P>

<SPEAKER>Vortex.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, yes, I've had them all.—One phy∣sician told me it was caused by too brilliant and effer∣vescent a genius;—the next said, it was the scurvy; —a third, it proceeded from not eating pepper to a melon;—another had the impudence to hint it was only little qualms that agitated some gentlemen who had made fortunes in India;—one recommended a sea voyage,—another a flannel night-cap;—one prescrib'd water,—the other brandy; but, how∣ever they all agreed in this essential point, that I'm not to be contradicted, but have my way in every thing.</P>

<P>'Tis very true; but I assure you I tried every where to get them dearer, but cou'd not.</P>

<PB N="13" REF="12"/>
<SPEAKER>Miss Vor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly, else what would have been the use of giving the fete. Then the company; such charming eccentricity, such characters out of character.—We had a noble Peer bowing for cus∣tom to his shop, and an Alderman turning over the music leaves for the celebrated Soprano; an Orator's lady detailing her hnsband's three hours speech in Parliament, and the Orator himself de∣scribing how puppets are managed at the Fantoc∣cini; we had grandmothers making assignations with boys, and the children of Israel joining the host of Pharaoh.—Oh! my dear Miss Vortex, why don't you partake in these charming scenes?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ellen.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear Miss Vortex, six suppers would annihilate my fortune.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Vor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh true, I forgot your uncommon small fortune. But I don't think it much signifies. I swear, people of fashion in town seem to do as well without money, as with it. You might be success∣ful at play. There are points to be learnt, which certainly do not give you the worst of the game. Come, will you be my protegée?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ellen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Excuse me, coussn, I dare say I ought to be covered with blushes, when I own a vulgar detesta∣tion of the character of a female gamester, and I must decline the honor of your introduction to the haut ton till at least they have justice on their side.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Miss Vor.</SPEAKER>
<P>An uncommon odd girl, Nabob.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ellen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Heavens! to what state of abject degra∣dation must fashionable society be reduced, when officers of police are as much dreaded by ladies in the purlieus of St. James's, as they are by cut pur∣ses in the wretched haunts of St. Giles.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Vor.</SPEAKER>
<P>For shame, Ellen, to censure your own sex.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ellen.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, madam, I am its advocate, and in that sex's name protest an abhorrence of those wo∣men, who do not consider any thing shameful but to be ashamed of any thing; whose resemblance to nature and innocence exists but in their nakedness, and to whom honour is only known as a pledge at a gaming table.</P>

<P>Did you ever hear, Nabob?</P>

<P>I did not hear a word she said; I was thinking of my speech.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Vor.</SPEAKER>
<P>A pert, Gothic, low-bred creature! But her contemptible fortune suits uncommon well with her grovelling ideas.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Vortex.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't talk of her fortune, it always makes my poor head worse. You know at the time I gave her five thousand pounds in lieu of what I called her expectations, I had in my hands an enormous sum of her's. O dear! I'm afraid the doctor was right—ah! mine are certainly East India qualms—I wonder if giving her fifty thousand back again wou'd do my heart any good.</P>
</SP>

</SP>

<P>That's very true.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Vor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Some people certainly do contrive to grub on with ten thousand, but how they do it is to me miraculous; then think of your intention of marrying me to the son of your great rival the ba∣ronet; think of his borough.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Vortex.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! very true.—Conscience avaunt; I have made a motion on matrimony to Sir Hubert.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Vor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Heart interested! Lud, how can you suspect me of so uncommon vulgar a sensation. I trust my joy is occasioned by ideas more becoming a woman of fashion.—I am charm'd because his fortune is large, his family ancient; and because my marriage will render all my female friends so uncommon miserable; and because I suspect that Ellen met young Stanley at Spa, and that she dares aspire to—</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Hub.</SPEAKER>
<P>Listen to me.—You have heard how my father kept alive the benevolent hospitality that once distinguish'd old England, and I not finding in modern ethics aught likely to improve either the morals or happiness of mankind, determin'd to persevere in the ways of my fathers. Soon after you went abroad the adjoining estate was purchased by an East Indian, groaning under wealth produc'd by groans. Like the viper, after collecting in the warm sunshine his bag of venom, he came to the abode of peace and innocence, and disseminated his poison. But mark me—think me not so unjust, boy, as with random slander to censure any body of men. No, thank heaven; there are numbers whom Providence, in addition to the power, has added the will, to render wealth a blessing to all around them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are ever just and liberal.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Hub.</SPEAKER>
<P>But for this vile exception, this Mr. Vortex, I tell thee, riot, contention, indolence, and vice succeeded. I struggled against this mischies, which spurr'd him on to oppose me in my election. This contest (I trust, Charlea, you think
<PB N="18" REF="17"/>the dignity of your family demanded it)—this con∣test, I say, obliged me to mortgage my estate to a considerable amount; and I fear, boy, even that will not suffice.—Dost thou not blame thy father?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Blame, sir? my fortune, nay, my life is held but to promote your happiness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Hub.</SPEAKER>
<P>Glorious boy! then all will be well again—thy estate restor'd, thy wealth enlarg'd</P>

<P>By marriage, Charles.—</P>
<STAGE>(Charles averts his face with dejection.)</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Marriage, sir!—To conceal the passion that triumphs here were but to deceive a father, and injure the bright excellence I love. When I was ill at Spa, the votaries of pleasure avoided me as the harbinger of melancholy, and I was despis'd as a thing passing into oblivion by all but one fair creature. I obtain'd an opportunity to thank her for the charitable pity her eye had beam'd on me. Love soon kindled his torch at Pity's altar, for I found in Miss Vortex such excellence—</P>

<P>Now, good Frank, ease my tortur'd mind.—What of my father?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, your honour, Mr. Bronze came laughing out of dining-room, and says, "Daame, how the old Baronet has been roasted." So, fur, I not knowing what they could mean by roasting a Christian, axed. "Why," says he, grinning. "they voted, that it was a pity the dignity of the bloody hand interfer'd, or the old beggar might set up a shop."</P>

<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>So says I, Domme, if young 'squire had been among them, he would have knocked all their heads together. Now wouldn't you, fur, have knock'd their heads together? Then they all laugh'd at me: which somehow made all the blood in my body come into my knuckles. So says I, "Mr. Bronze, suppose a case—suppose me young 'squire Stanley—now, say that again about his ho∣nour'd father."—So he did; and I lent him such a drive o'the feace—and I was knocking all their heads together pretty tightish—till the cook laid me flat wi' the poker: then they all fell upon me; and when I could sight no longer, I fell a crying, and run to tell your honour.</P>

<SPEAKER>Sir Hub.</SPEAKER>
<P>What can it mean?—Charles parted from me in an agony the ingenuousness of his nature had not art to conceal;—he grasp'd my hand,— bade me farewell, as if it were for ever,—then broke away—leaving me a prey to wild conjecture and despait;—soon shall I be at peace.—infir∣mity, when goaded on by sorrow, presses to the goal of life with double speed—Surely thro' that laurel grove, I see two female figures glide along; my eyes are not of the best, and the sorrow I have felt for my dear boy has not strengthened them; —they approach—</P>

<P>So, Mr. Rapid!—How happened this, sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O. Rap.</SPEAKER>
<P>Really, Sir Hubert, I don't under∣stand the cut of it; all I can say is, your son's be∣haviour
<PB N="59" REF="60"/>was—oh—supersine;—when they had fired their pistols they drew out their swords, and your son disarm'd Neddy, and then he generously gave him his sword again, which was extremely genteel,— for it was a brand new silver-hilted sword, and, I suppose by the laws of honour he might have kept it.—</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jessy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Jessy Oatland.—The indiscretion of my father has made me a servant.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>O. Rap.</SPEAKER>
<P>And the discretion of his father has made him a gentleman—But I'll make the rascal know you are not humbled by your Father's con∣duct, nor is he exalted by his, a villain!—Can he hope to be call'd a man of honour for opposing his head to a pistol, while himself levels the shaft of anguish at an innocent woman's heart?—But I'll kill him, that's one comfort.—Come with me, sweet one!</P>
