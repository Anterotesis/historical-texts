</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE dawn of morning now trembled through the clouds, when the travellers stopped at a small town to change horses. Theodore entreated Adeline to alight and take some re∣freshment, and to this she at length consented. But the people of the inn were not yet up, and it was some time before the knocking and roar∣ing of the postillion could rouse them.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="3"/>
Having taken some slight refreshment, Theo∣dore and Adeline returned to the carriage. The only subject upon which Theodore could have spoke with interest, delicacy forbade him at this time to notice; and after pointing out some beautiful scenery on the road, and making other efforts to support a conversation, he relapsed into silence. His mind, though still anxious, was now relieved from the apprehension that had long oppressed it. When he first saw Ade∣line, her loveliness made a deep impression on his heart: there was a sentiment in her beauty, which his mind immediately acknowledged, and the effect of which, her manners and con∣versation had afterwards confirmed. Her charms appeared to him like those since so finely des∣cribed by an English poet:
<Q><LG>
<L>"Oh! have you seen, bath' d in the morning dew,</L>
<L>"The budding rose its infant bloom display;</L>
<L>"When first its virgin tints unfold to view,</L>
<L>"It shrinks and scarcely trusts the blaze of day?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"So soft so delicate, so sweet she came,</L>
<L>"Youth's damask glow just dawning on her cheek.</L>
<L>"I gaz'd, I sigh'd, I caught the tender flame,</L>
<L>"Felt the fond pang, and droop'd with passion weak."</L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>A knowledge of her destitute condition, and of the dangers with which she was environed, had awakened in his heart the tenderest touch of pity, and assisted the change of admiration into love. The distress he suffered, when com∣pelled to leave her exposed to these dangers,
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
without being able to warn her of them, can on∣ly be imagined. During his residence with his regiment, his mind was the constant prey of ter∣rors, which he saw no means of combating, but by returning to the neighbourhood of the abbey, where he might obtain early intelligence of the Marquis's schemes, and be ready to give his assistance to Adeline.</P>
<P>Leave of absence he could not request, with∣out betraying his design where most he dreaded it should be known, and, at length, with a gene∣rous rashness, which, though it defied law was impelled by virtue, he secretly quitted his regiment. The progress of the Marquis's plan he had observed, with trembling anxiety, till, the night that was to decide the fate of Adeline and himself roused all his mind to action, and involved him in a tumult of hope and fear—hor∣ror and expectation.</P>
<P>Never, till the present hour, had he ventured to believe she was in safety. Now the distance they had gained from the chateau, without per∣ceiving any pursuit, increased his best hopes. It was impossible he could sit by the side of his beloved Adeline, and receive assurances of her gra∣titude and esteem, without venturing to hope for her love. He congratulated himself as her preser∣ver, and anticipated scenes of happiness when she should be under the protection of his family. The clouds of misery and apprehension disappear∣ed from his mind, and left it to the sunshine of joy.
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
When a shadow of fear would sometimes return, or when he recollected, with compunction, the circumstances under which he had left his regi∣ment, stationed, as it was, upon the frontiers, and in a time of war, he looked at Adeline, and her countenance, with instantaneous magic, beamed peace upon his heart.</P>
<P>But Adeline had a subject of anxiety from which Theodore was exempt; the prospect of her future days was involved in darkness and uncertainty. Again she was going to claim the bounty of strangers—again going to en∣counter the uncertainty of their kindness; ex∣posed to the hardships of dependance, or to the dif∣ficulty of earning a precarious livelihood. These anticipations obscured the joy occas oned by her escape, and by the affection which the conduct and avowal of Theodore had exhibited. The delicacy of his behaviour, in forbearing to take advantage of her present situation to plead his love, increased her esteem, and flattered her pride.</P>
<P>Adeline was lost in meditation upon subjects like these, when the postillion stopped the car∣riage; and pointing to part of a road, which wound down the side of a hill they had passed, said there were several horsemen in pursuit! Theodore immediately ordered him to proceed with all possible speed, and to strike out of the great road into the first obscure way that offered. The postillion cracked his whip in the air, and
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
set off as if he was flying for life. In the mean while Theodore endeavoured to re-animate Ade∣line, who was sinking with terror, and who now thought, if she could only escape from the Marquis, she could defy the future.</P>
<P>Presently they struck into a bye lane, screened and overshadowed by thick trees; Theodore again looked from the window, but the closing boughs prevented his seeing far enough to deter∣mine whether the pursuit continued. For his sake Adeline endeavoured to disguise her emo∣tions. <Q REND="inline">"This lane,"</Q> said Theodore, <Q REND="inline">"will certainly lead to a town or village, and then we have nothing to apprehend; for, though my single arm could not defend you against the number of our pursuers, I have no doubt of being a'le to interest some of the inhabitants in our behalf."</Q></P>
<P>Adeline appeared to be comforted by the hope this reflection suggested, and Theodore aga n looked back, but the windings of the road clo∣sed his view, and the rattling of the wheels over∣came every other sound. At length he called to the postillion to stop, and having listened at∣tentively, without perceiving any sound of hor∣ses, he began to hope they were now in safety. <Q REND="inline">"Do you know where this road leads?"</Q> said he. The postillion answered that he did not, but he saw some houses through the trees at a distance, and believed it led to them. This was most welcome intelligence to Theodore,
<PB N="8" REF="7" MS="y"/>
who looked forward and perceived the houses. The postillion set off, <Q REND="inline">"Fear nothing, my adored Adeline,"</Q> said he, <Q REND="inline">"you are now safe; I will part with you but with life."</Q> Adeline sighed, not for herself only, but for the danger to which Theodore might be exposed.</P>
<P>They had continued to travel in this man∣ner for near half an hour, when they arrived at a small village, and soon after stopped at an inn, the best the place afforded. As Theodore lifted Adeline from the chaise, he again entreat∣ed her to dismiss her apprehensions, and spoke with a tenderness, to which she could reply only by a smile that ill concealed her anxiety. After ordering refreshments, he went out to speak with the landlord, but had scarcely left the room, when Adeline observed a party of horse∣men enter the inn-yard, and she had no doubt these were the persons from whom they fled. The faces of two of them only were turned to∣wards her, but she thought the figure of one of the others not unlike that of the Marquis.</P>
<P>Her heart was chilled, and for some moments the powers of reason forsook her. Her first de∣sign was to seek concealment; but while she considered the means, one of the horsemen look∣ed up to the window near which she stood, and speaking to his companions, they entered the inn. To quit the room, without being obser∣ved, was impossible; to remain there, alone and unprotected as she was, would almost be
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
equally dangerous. She paced the room in an ago ny of terror, often secretly calling on Theodore and often wondering he did not return. These were moments of indescribable suffering. A loud and tumultuous sound of voices now arose from a distant part of the house, and she soon distinguished the words of the disputants. <Q REND="inline">"I arrest you in the King's name,"</Q> said one <Q REND="inline">"and bid You, at your peril, attempt to go from hence, except under a guard."</Q></P>
<P>The next minute Adeline heard the voice of Theodore in reply. <Q REND="inline">"I do not mean to dis∣pute the King's orders,"</Q> said he, <Q REND="inline">"and give you my word of honour not to go without you; but first unhand me, that I may return to that room; I have a friend there whom I wish to speak with."</Q> To this proposal they at fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st objected, considering it merely as an ex∣cuse to obtain an opportunity of escaping; but after much altercation and entreaty, his request was granted. He sprang forwards towards the room where Adeline remained, and while a serjeant and corporal followed him to the door, the two soldiers went out into the yard of the inn, to watch the windows of the apartment.</P>
<P>With an eager hand he unclosed the door, but Adeline hastened not to meet him, for she had fainted almost at the beginning of the dis∣pute. Theodore called loudly for assistance, and the mistress of the inn soon appeared with her stock of remedies, which were administered
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>
in vain to Adeline, who remained insensible, and by breathing alone gave signs of her exist∣ence. The distress of Theodore was in the mean time heightened by the appearance of the offi∣cers, who, laughing at the discovery of his pretended friend, declared they could wait no longer. Saying this, they would have forced him from the inanimate form of Adeline, over whom he hung in unutterable anguish, when fiercely turning upon them, he drew his sword and swore no power on earth should force him away before the lady recovered.</P>
<P>The men, enraged by the action and the de∣termined air of Theodore, exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"Do you oppose the King's orders?"</Q> and advanced to seize him, but he presented the point of his sword, and bid them at their peril approach. One of them immediately drew, Theodore kept his guard, but did not advance. <Q REND="inline">"I demand only to wait here, till the lady recovers,"</Q> said he; <Q REND="inline">"you understand the alternative."</Q> The man, already exasperated by the opposition of Theodore, regarded the latter part of his speech as a threat, and became determined not to give up the point; he pressed forward, and while his comrade called the men from the yard, Theo∣dore wounded him slightly in the shoulder, and received himself the stroke of a sabre on his head.</P>
<P>The blood gushed furiously from the wound; Theodore, staggering to a chair, sunk into it, just as the remainder of the party entered the
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>
room, and Adeline unclosed her eyes to see him ghastly pale, and covered with blood. She ut∣tered an involuntary scream, and exclaiming, <Q REND="inline">"they have murdered him,"</Q> nearly relapsed. At the sound of her voice he raised his head, and smiling held out his hand to her. <Q REND="inline">"I am not much hurt,"</Q> said he faintly, <Q REND="inline">"and shall soon be better, if indeed you are recovered."</Q> She hastened towards him, and gave her hand. <Q REND="inline">"Is nobody gone for a surgeon?"</Q> said she, with a look of agony. <Q REND="inline">"Do not be alarmed,"</Q> said Theodore, <Q REND="inline">"I am not so ill as you imagine."</Q> The room was now crowded with people, whom the report of the affray had brought together; among these was a man, who acted as physi∣cian, apothecary, and surgeon to the village, and who now stepped forward to the assistance of Theodore.</P>
<P>Having examined the wound, he declined giving his opinion, but ordered the patient to be immediately put to bed, to which the officers objected, alledging that it was their duty to car∣ry him to the regiment. <Q REND="inline">"That cannot be done without great danger to his life,"</Q> re∣plied the doctor; <Q REND="inline">"and"—</Q><Q REND="inline">"Oh! his life,"</Q> said the serjeant; <Q REND="inline">"we have nothing to do with that, we must do our duty."</Q> Adeline, who had hitherto stood in trembling anxiety, could now no longer be silent. <Q REND="inline">"Since the surgeon,"</Q> said she, <Q REND="inline">"has declared it his opinion, that this gentleman cannot be removed in his present
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>
condition, without endangering his life, you will remember, that if he dies, yours will probably answer it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yes,"</Q> rejoined the surgeon, who was un∣willing to relinquish his patient, <Q REND="inline">"I declare be∣fore these witnesses, that he cannot be remov∣ed with safety: you will do well, therefore, to consider the consequences. He has receiv∣ed a very dangerous wound, which requires the most careful treatment, and the event is even then doubtful; but if he travels, a fever may ensue, and the wound will then be mor∣tal."</Q> Theodore heard this sentence with composure, but Adeline could with difficulty conceal the anguish of her heart: she roused all her fortitude to suppress the tears that struggled in her eyes; and though she wished to interest the humanity, or to awaken the fears of the men, in behalf of their unfortunate prisoner, she dared not to trust her voice with utterance.</P>
<P>From this internal struggle she was relieved by the compassion of the people who filled the room, and becoming clamorous in the cause of Theodore, declared the officers would be guilty of murder if they removed him. <Q REND="inline">"Why he must die at any rate,"</Q> said the serjeant, <Q REND="inline">"for quitting his post, and drawing upon me in the execution of the King's orders."</Q> A faint sickness seized the heart of Adeline, and she leaned for support against Theodore's chair, whose concern for himself was for a while sus∣pended
<PB N="13" REF="12"/>
in his anxiety for her. He supported her with his arm, and forcing a smile, said in a low voice, which she only could hear, <Q REND="inline">"This is a misrepresentation; I doubt not, when the affair is inquired into, it will be settled with∣out any serious consequences."</Q></P>
<P>Adeline knew these words were uttered only to console her, and therefore did not give much credit to them, though Theodore continued to give her similar assurances of his safety. Mean∣while the mob, whose compassion for him had been gradually excited by the obduracy of the officer, were now roused to pity and indignation by the seeming certainty of his punishment, and the unfeeling manner, in which it had been denounced. In a short time they became so much enraged, that, partly from a dread of farther consequences, and partly from the shame which their charges of cruelty occasioned, the serjeant consented that he should be put to bed, till his commanding officer might direct what was to be done. Adeline's joy at this circum∣stance overcame for a moment the sense of her misfortunes, and of her situation.</P>
<P>She waited in an adjoining room the sentence of the surgeon, who was now engaged in exa∣mining the wound; and though the accident would in any other circumstances have severely afflicted her, she now lamented it the more, be∣cause she considered herself as the cause of it,
<PB N="14" REF="13"/>
and because the misfortune, by illustrating more fully the affection of her lover, drew him closer to her heart, and seemed, therefore, to sharpen the poignancy of her affliction. The dreadful assertion that Theodore, should he re∣cover, would be punished with death, she scarce∣ly dared to consider, but endeavoured to believe that it was no more than a cruel exaggeration of his antagonist.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, Theodore's present danger, together with the attendant circumstances, awakened all her tenderness, and discovered to her the true state of her affections. The grace∣ful form, the noble, intelligent countenance, and the engaging manners which she had at first admired in Theodore, became afterwards more interesting by that strength of thought, and ele∣gance of sentiment, exhibited in his conversati∣on. His conduct, since her escape, had excited her warmest gratitude, and the danger which he had now encountered in her behalf, called forth her tenderness, and heightened it into love. The veil was removed from her heart, and she saw for the first time, its genuine emotions.</P>
<P>The surgeon at length came out of Theodore's chamber into the room where Adeline was waiting to speak with him. She inquired con∣cerning the state of his wound. <Q REND="inline">"You are a relation of the gentleman's, I presume, Ma∣dam; his sister, perhaps"</Q> The question vexed and embarrassed her, and, without an∣swering
<PB N="15" REF="14"/>
it, she repeated her inquiry. <Q REND="inline">"Per∣haps, Madam, you are more nearly related,"</Q> pursued the surgeon, seeming also to disregard her question, <Q REND="inline">"perhaps you are his wife."</Q> Adeline blushed, and was about to reply, but he continued his speech. <Q REND="inline">"The interest you take in his welfare is, at least, very flattering, and I would almost consent to exchange con∣ditions with him, were I sure of receiving such tender compassion from so charming a lady."</Q> Saying this, he bowed to the ground. Adeline assuming a very reserved air, said, <Q REND="inline">"Now, Sir, that you have concluded your compliment, you will perhaps, attend to my question; I hav enquired how you left your patient."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"That, Madam, is, perhaps, a question very difficult to be resolved; and it is likewise a very disagreeable office to pronounce ill news—I fear he will die."</Q> The surgeon opened his snuff-box and presented it to Adeline<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <Q REND="inline">"Die!"</Q> she exclaimed in a faint voice, <Q REND="inline">"Die!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Do not be alarmed, Madam,"</Q> resumed the surgeon, observing her grow pale, <Q REND="inline">"do not be alarmed. It is possible that the wound may not have reached the —,"</Q> he stammered; <Q REND="inline">"in that case the —,"</Q> stammering again, <Q REND="inline">"is not affected; and if so, the interior mem∣branes of the brain are not touched: in this case the wound may, perhaps, escape inflam∣mation,
<PB N="16" REF="15"/>
and the patient may possibly recover. But if, on the other hand, —"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I beseech you, Sir, to speak intelligibly,"</Q> interrupted Adeline, <Q REND="inline">"and not to trifle with my anxiety. Do you really believe him in danger?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"In danger, Madam,"</Q> exclaimed the sur∣geon, <Q REND="inline">"in danger! yes, certainly, in very great danger."</Q> Saying this, he walked away with an air of chagrin and displeasure. Adeline remained for some moments in the room, in an excess of sorrow, which she found it impossible to restrain, and then drying her tears, and en∣deavouring to compose her countenance, she went to inquire for the mistress of the inn, to whom she sent a waiter. After expecting her in vain for some time, she rang the bell, and sent another message somewhat more pressing. Still the hostess did not appear, and Adeline, at length, went herself down stairs, where she found her, surrounded by a number of people, relating, with a loud voice and va<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ious gesti∣culations, the particulars of the late accident. Perceiving Adeline, she called out, <Q REND="inline">"Oh! here is Mademoiselle herself,"</Q> and the eyes of the assembly were immediately turned upon her. Adeline, whom the crowd prevented from approaching the hostess, now beckoned her, and was going to withdraw, but the land∣lady, eager in the pursuit of her story, dis∣regarded the signal. In vain did Adeline en-<PB N="17" REF="16"/>
endeavour
to catch her eye; it glanced every where but upon her, who was unwilling to attract the farther notice of the crowd by calling out.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"It is a great pity, to be sure, that he should be shot,"</Q> said the landlady, <Q REND="inline">"he's such a handsome man; but they say he certainly will if he recovers. Poor Gentleman! he will very likely not suffer though, for the doctor says he will never go out of this house alive."</Q> Adeline now spoke to a man who stood near, and desiring he would tell the hostess she wished to speak with her, left the place.</P>
<P>In about ten minutes the landlady appeared. <Q REND="inline">"Alas! Madamoiselle,"</Q> said she, <Q REND="inline">"your brother is in a sad condition; they fear he won't get over it."</Q> Adeline inquired whether there was any other medical person in the town than the surgeon whom she had seen. <Q REND="inline">"Lord, Madam, this is a rare healthy place; we have little need of <HI>medicine</HI> people here; such an accident never happened in it before. The doctor has been here ten years, but there's very bad encouragement for his trade, and I believe he's poor enough himself. One of the sort's quite enough for us."</Q> Adeline interrupted her to ask some questions concern∣ing Theodore, whom the hoste's had attended to his chamber. She inquired how he had borne the dressing of the wound, and whether he ap∣peared to be easier after the operation; questions
<PB N="18" REF="17"/>
to which the hostess gave no very satisfactory answers. She now inquired whether there was any surgeon in the neighbourhood of the town, and was told there was not.</P>
<P>The distress visible in Adeline's countenance seemed to excite the compassion of the landlady, who now endeavoured to console her in the best manner she was able. She advised her to send for her friends, and offered to procure a mes∣senger. Adeline sighed and said it was un∣necessary. <Q REND="inline">"I don't know, Ma'amselle, what you may think necessary,"</Q> continued the hostess, <Q REND="inline">"but I know I should think it very hard to die in a strange place with no relati∣ons near me, and I dare say the poor gentle∣man thinks so himself; and, besides, who is to pay for his funeral if he dies?"</Q> Adeline begged she would be silent, and, desiring that every proper attention might be given, she promised her a reward for her trouble, and re∣quested pen and ink immediately. <Q REND="inline">"Ay, to be sure, Ma'amselle, that is the proper way; why your friends would never forgive you if you did not acquaint them; I know it by my∣self. And as for taking care of him, he shall have every thing the house affords, and I warrant there is never a better inn in the pro∣vince, though the town is none of the big∣gest."</Q> Adeline was obliged to repeat her re∣quest for pen and ink, before the loquacious hostess would quit the room.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="18"/>
The thought of sending for Theodore's friends had, in the tumult of the late scenes, never oc∣curred to her, and she was now somewhat con∣soled by the prospect of comfort which it opened for him. When the pen and ink were brought, she wrote the following note to Theodore.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"In your present condition, you have need of every comfort that can be procured you, and surely there is no cordial more valuable in illness, than the presence of a friend: suffer me, therefore to acquaint your family with your situation; it will be a satisfaction to me, and, I doubt not, a consolation to you."</Q></P>
<P>In a short time after she had sent the note, she received a message from Theodore, en∣treating most respectfully, but earnestly, to see her for a few minutes. She immediately went to his chamber, and found her worst appre∣hensions confirmed, by the languor expressed in his countenance, while the shock she received, together with her struggle to disguise her emo∣tions, almost overcame her. <Q REND="inline">"I thank you for this goodness,"</Q> said he, extending his hand which she received, and, sitting down by the bed, burst into a flood of tears. When her agitation had somewhat subsided, and, remov∣ing her handkerchief from her eyes, she again looked on Theodore, a smile of the tenderest love expressed his sense of the interest she took in his welfare, and administered a temporary relief to her heart.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="19"/>
<Q REND="inline">"Forgive this weakness,"</Q> said she; <Q REND="inline">"my spirits have of late been so variously agi∣tated"—</Q>Theodore interrupted her—<Q REND="inline">"These tears are most flattering to my heart. But, for my sake endeavour to support yourself: I doubt not I shall soon be better; the sur∣geon"—</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I do not like him,"</Q> said Adeline, <Q REND="inline">"but tell me how you find yourself?"</Q> He assured her that he was now much easier than he had yet been, and mentioning her kind note, he led to the subject, on account of which he had solicited to see her. <Q REND="inline">"My family,"</Q> said he, <Q REND="inline">"reside at a great distance from hence, and I well know their affection is such, that, were they informed of my situation, no con∣sideration, however reasonable, could prevent their coming to my assistance; but before they can arrive, their presence will probably be unnecessary,"</Q> (Adeline looked earnestly at him) <Q REND="inline">"I should probably be well,"</Q> pur∣sued he, smiling, <Q REND="inline">"before a letter could reach them; it would, therefore, occasion them unnecessary pain, and, moreover, a fruitless journey. For your sake, Adeline, I could wish they were here, but a few days will more fully shew the consequences of my wound: let us wait, at least, till then, and be directed by circumstances."</Q></P>
<P>Adeline forbore to press the subject farther, and turned to one more immediately inte∣resting.
<PB N="21" REF="20"/>
<Q REND="inline">"I much wish,"</Q> said she, <Q REND="inline">"that you had a more able surgeon; you know the geography of the province better than I do; are we in the neighbourhood ofany town likely to afford you other advice?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I believe not,"</Q> said he, <Q REND="inline">"and this is an affair of little consequence, for my wound is so inconsiderable, that a very moderate share of skill may suffice to cure it. But why, my beloved Adeline, do you give way to this anxiety? Why suffer yourself to be disturbed by this tendency to forbode the worst? I am willing, perhaps presump∣tuously so, to attribute it to your kindness, and suffer me to assure you, that, while it excites my gratitude, it increases my ten∣derest esteem. O Adeline! since you wish my speedy recovery, let me see you compos∣ed: while I believe you to be unhappy I can∣not be well."—</Q>She assured him she would endeavour to be, at least, tranquil, and fearing the conversation, if prolonged, would be preju∣dicial to him, she left him to repose.</P>
<P>As she turned cut of the gallery, she met the hostess, upon whom certain words of Adeline had operated as a talisman, transforming neglect and impertinence into officious civility. She came to enquire whether the gentleman above stairs had every thing that he liked, for she was sure it was her endeavour that he should. <Q REND="inline">"I have got him a nurse, Ma'amselle, to attend
<PB N="22" REF="21"/>
him, and I dare say she will do very well, but I will look to that, for I shall not mind helping him myself some times. Poor gentle∣man! how patiently he bears it! One would not think now that he believes he is going to die; yet the doctor told him so himself, or at least as good."</Q> Adeline was extremely shocked at this imprudent conduct of the sur∣geon, and dismissed the landlady, after ordering a slight dinner.</P>
<P>Towards evening the surgeon again made his appearance, and, having passed some time with his patient, returned to the parlour, according to the desire of Adeline, to inform her of his con∣dition. He answered Adeline's inquiries with great solemnity. <Q REND="inline">"It is impossible to determine positively, at present, Madam, but I have reason to adhere to the opinion I gave you this morning. I am not apt, indeed, to form opinions upon uncertain grounds. I will give you a singular instance of this:</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"It is not above a fortnight since I was sent for to a patient at some leagues distance. I was from home when the messenger arrived, and the case being urgent, before I could reach the patient, another physician was consulted, who had ordered such medicines as he thought proper, and the patient had been apparently relieved by them. His friends were con∣gratulating themselves upon his improvement when I arrived, and had agreed in opinion
<PB N="23" REF="22"/>
with the physician, that there was no danger in his case. Depend upon it, said I, you are mistaken; these medicines cannot have relieved him; the patient is in the utmost danger. The patient groaned, but my bro∣ther physician persisted in affirming that the remedies he had prescribed would not only be certain, but speedy, some good effect having been already produced by them. Upon this I lost all patience, and adhering to my opinion, that these effects were fallacious and the case desperate, I assured the patient himself that his life was in the utmost danger. I am not one of those, Madam, who deceive their pati∣ents to the last moment; but you shall hear the conclusion.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"My brother physician was, I suppose, en∣raged by the firmness of my opposition, for he assumed a most angry look, which did not in the least affect me, and turning to the patient, desired he would decide, upon which of our opinions to rely, for he must decline acting with me. The patient did me the honour,"</Q> pursued the surgeon, with a smile of compla∣cency, and smoothing his ruffles, <Q REND="inline">"to think more highly of me than, perhaps, I deserved, for he immediately dismissed my opponent. I could not have believed, said he, as the physician left the room, I could not have believed that a man, who has been so many
<PB N="24" REF="23"/>
in the profession, could be so wholly ignorant of it.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I could not have believed it either, said I.—I am astonished that he was not aware of my danger, resumed the patient.—I am astonished likewise, replied I—I was resolved to do what I could for the pati∣ent, for he was a man of understanding, as you perceive, and I had a regard for him. I, therefore, altered the prescriptions, and myself administered the medicines; but all would not do, my opinion was verified, and he died even before the next morning."—</Q>Adeline, who had been compelled to listen to this long story, sighed at the conclusion of it. <Q REND="inline">"I don't wonder that you are affected, Madam"</Q> said the surgeon, <Q REND="inline">"the instance I have rela∣ted is certainly a very affecting one. It dis∣tressed me so much, that it was some time before I could think, or even speak concern∣ing it. But you must allow, Madam,"</Q> continued he, lowering his voice and bowing with a look of self congratulation, <Q REND="inline">"that this was a striking instance of the infallibility of my judgment."</Q></P>
<P>Adeline shuddered at the infallibility of his judgment, and made no reply. <Q REND="inline">"It was a shock∣ing thing for the poor man,"</Q> resumed the surgeon.—<Q REND="inline">"It was, indeed, very shocking,"</Q> said Adeline.—<Q REND="inline">"It affected me a good deal when it happened,"</Q> continued he.—<Q REND="inline">"Un∣doubtedly, Sir,"</Q> said Adeline.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="24"/>
<Q REND="inline">"But time wears away the most painful impressions."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I think you mentioned it was about a fortnight since this happened."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Somewhere thereabouts,"</Q> replied the surgeon, without seeming to understand the observation.—<Q REND="inline">"And will you permit me, Sir, to ask the name of the physician, who so ignorantly opposed you?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Certainly, Madam, it is Lafance."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"He lives in the obscurity he deserves, no doubt"</Q> said Adeline.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why no, Madam, he lives in a town of some note, at about the distance of four leagues from hence, and affords one instance, among many others, that the public opinion is generally erroneous. You will hardly believe it, but I assure you it is a fact, that this man comes into a great deal of practice, while I am suffered to remain here, ne∣glected, and, indeed, very little known."</Q></P>
<P>During his narrative, Adeline had been con∣sidering by what means she could discover the name of the physician, for the instance that had been produced to prove his <HI>ignorance,</HI> and the <HI>infallibility</HI> of his opponent, had complete∣ly settled her opinion concerning them both. She now, more than ever, wished to deliver Theodore from the hands of the surgeon, and was musing on the possibility, when he, with so much self-security, developed the means.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="25"/>
She asked him a few more questions con∣cerning the state of Theodore's wound, and was told it was much as it had been, but that some degree of fever had come on. <Q REND="inline">"But I have ordered a fire to be made in the room,"</Q> continued the surgeon, <Q REND="inline">"and some additional blankets to be laid on the bed; these, I doubt not, will have a proper ef∣fect. In the mean time they must be careful to keep from him every kind of li∣quid, except some cordial draughts, which I shall send. He will naturally ask for drink, but it must, on no ac∣count, be given to him."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You do not approve, then, of the method, which I have somewhere heard of,"</Q> said Adeline, <Q REND="inline">"of attending to nature in these cases."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Nature, Madam!"</Q> pursued he, <Q REND="inline">"Nature is the most improper guide in the world. I always adopt a method directly contrary to what she would suggest; for what can be the use of Art, if she is only to follow Nature? This was my first opinion on setting out in life, and I have ever since strict∣ly adhered to it. From what I have said, indeed, Madam, you may, per∣haps, perceive that my opinions may be depended on; what they once are they always are, for my mind is not of
<PB N="27" REF="26"/>
that frivolous kind to be affected by circum∣stances."</Q></P>
<P>Adeline was fatigued by this discourse, and impatient to impart to Theodore her discovery of a physician, but the surgeon seemed by no means disposed to leave her, and was expatiating upon various topics, with new instances of his surprising sagacity, when the waiter brought a message that some person desired to see him. He was, howe∣ver engaged upon too agreeable a topic to be easily prevailed upon to quit it, and it was not till after a second message was brought that he made his bow to Adeline and left the room. The moment he was gone she sent a note to Theodore, entreating his permission to call in the assistance of the physician.</P>
<P>The conceited manners of the surgeon had by this time given Theodore a very unfa∣vourable opinion of his talents, and the last prescription had so fully confirmed it, that he now readily consented to have other advice.</P>
<P>Adeline immediately inquired for a mes∣senger, but recollecting that the residence of the physician was still a secret, she applied to the hostess, who being really ignorant of it, or pretending to be so, gave her no in∣formation. What farther inquiries she made were equally ineffectual, and she passed some hours in extreme distress, while the disorder of Theodore rather increased than abated.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="27"/>
When supper appeared, she asked the boy who waited, if he knew a physician of the name of Lafance, in the neighbour∣hood. <Q REND="inline">"Not in the neighbourhood, Madam, but I know Doctor Lafance of Chancy, for I come from the town."—</Q>Ade∣line inquired farther, and received very satis∣factory answers. But the town was at some leagues distance, and the delay this circum∣stance must oceasion again alarmed her; she, however, ordered a messenger to be immedi∣ately dispatched, and, having sent again to inquire concerning Theodore, retired to her chamber for the night.</P>
<P>The continued fatigue she had suffered for the last fourteen hours overcame anxiety, and her harrassed spirits sunk to repose. She slept till late in the morning, and was then awakened by the landlady, who came to in∣form her that Theodore was much worse, and to inquire what should be done. Adeline, find∣ing that the physician was not arrived, im∣mediately arose, and hastened to inquire far∣ther concerning Theodore. The hostess in∣formed her, that he had passed a very disturb∣ed night; that he had complained of being very hot, and desired that the fire in his room might be extinguished; but that the nurse knew her duty too well to obey him, and had strictly followed the doctor's orders.</P>
<P>She added, that he had taken the cordial draughts regularly, but had, not withstanding,
<PB N="29" REF="28"/>
continued to grow worse, and at last became light-headed. In the mean time the boy, who had been sent for the physician, was still absent:—<Q REND="inline">"And no wonder,"</Q> continued the hostess; <Q REND="inline">"why only consider, it's eight leagues off, and the lad had to find the road, bad as it is, in the dark. But, indeed, Ma'amselle, you might as well have trusted our doctor, for we never want any body else, not we, in the town here; and if I might speak my mind, Jacques had better have been sent off for the young gentleman's friends than for this strange doctor that no body knows."</Q></P>
<P>After asking some farther questions concern∣ing Theodore, the answers to which rather increased than diminished her alarm, Adeline endeavoured to compose her spirits, and await in patience the arrival of the physician. She was now more sensible than ever of the forlornness of her own condition, and of the danger of Theodore's, and earnestly wished that his friends could be informed of his situa∣tion; a wish which could not be gratified, for Theodore, who alone could acquaint her with their place of residence, was deprived of recollection.</P>
<P>When the surgeon arrived and perceived the situation of his patient, he expressed no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urprize; but having asked some questions, and given a few general directions, he went
<PB N="30" REF="29"/>
down to Adeline. After paying her his usual compliments, he suddenly assumed an air of importance, <Q REND="inline">"I am sorry, Madam,"</Q> said he, <Q REND="inline">"that it is my office to communicate disa∣greeable intelligence, but I wish you to be prepared for the event, which, I fear, is approaching."</Q> Adeline comprehended his meaning, and though she had hitherto given little faith to his judgment, she could not hear him hint at the immediate danger of Theo∣dore without yielding to the influence of fear.</P>
<P>She entreated him to acquaint her with all he apprehended; and he then proceeded to say, that Theodore was, as he had foreseen, much worse this morning than he had been the pre∣ceding night; and the disorder having now affected his head, there was every reason to fear it would prove fatal in a few hours. <Q REND="inline">"The worst consequences may ensue,"</Q> continued he; <Q REND="inline">"if the wound becomes inflamed, there will be very little chance of his recovery."</Q></P>
<P>Adeline listened to this sentence with a dreadful calmness, and gave no utterance to grief, either by words or tears. <Q REND="inline">"The gentleman, I suppose, Madam, has friends, and the sooner you inform them of his condition the better. If they reside at any distance, it is indeed too late; but there are other necessary—you are ill, Madam."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="30"/>
Adedeline made an effort to speak, but in vain, and the surgeon now called loudly for a glass of water; she drank it, and a deep sigh that she uttered, seemed somewhat to relieve her oppressed heart: tears succeeded. In the mean time, the surgeon perceiving she was better, though not well enough to listen to his conversation, took his leave, and promised to return in an hour. The physi∣cian was not yet arrived, and Adeline await∣ed his appearance with a mixture of fear and anxious hope.</P>
<P>About noon he came, and having been informed of the accident by which the fever was produced, and of the treatment which the surgeon had given it, he ascended to Theodore's chamber: in a quarter of an hour he returned to the room where Adeline expect∣ed him. <Q REND="inline">"The gentleman is still delirious,"</Q> said he, <Q REND="inline">"but I have ordered him a com∣posing draught."—</Q><Q REND="inline">"Is there any hope, Sir?"</Q> inquired Adeline. <Q REND="inline">"Yes, Madam, certainly there is hope; the case at present is somewhat doubtful, but a few hours may enable me to judge with more certainty. In the mean time, I have directed that he shall be kept quiet, and be allowed to drink freely of some diluting liquids."</Q></P>
<P>He had scarcely, at Adeline's request, re∣commended a surgeon, instead of the one at present employed, when the latter gentle∣man
<PB N="32" REF="31"/>
entered the room, and perceiving the physician, threw a glance of mingled sur∣prize and anger at Adeline, who retired with him to another apartment, where she dis∣missed him with a politeness, which he did not deign to return, and which he certainly did not deserve.</P>
<P>Early the following morning the surgeon arrived, but either the medicines, or the crisis of the disorder, had thrown Theodore into a deep sleep, in which he remained for several hours. The physician now gave Adeline reason to hope for a fevourable issue, and every pre∣caution was taken to prevent his being dis∣turbed. He awoke perfectly sensible and free from fever, and his first words inquired for Adeline, who soon learned that he was out of danger.</P>
<P>In a few days he was sufficiently recover∣ed to be removed from his chamber to a room adjoining, where Adeline met him with a joy, which she found it impossible to repress; and the observance of this lighted up his countenance with pleasure: indeed Adeline, sensible to the attachment he had so nobly testified, and softned by the danger he had encountered, no longer attempted to disguise the tenderness of her esteem, and was at length brought to confess the interest his first appearance had impressed upon her heart.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="32"/>
After an hour of affecting conversation, in which the happiness of a young and mu∣tual attachment occupied all their minds, and excluded every idea not in unison with delight, they returned to a sense of their present embarrassments: Adeline recollect∣ed that Theodore was arrested for disobe∣dience of orders, and deserting his post; and Theodore, that he must shortly be torn away from Adeline, who would be left expo∣sed to all the evils from which he had so lately rescued her. This thought overwhelmed his heart with anguish; and, after a long pause, he ventured to propose, what his wish∣es had often suggested, a marriage with Adeline before he departed from the village: this was the only means of preveting, per∣haps, an eternal saparation; and though he saw the many dangerous inconveniences to which she would be exposed, by a marriage with a man circumstanced like himself, yet these appeared so unequal to those she would otherwise he left to encounter alone, that his reason could no longer scruple to adopt what his affection had suggested.</P>
<P>Adeline was, for some time, too much agitated to reply; and though she had little to oppose to the arguments and pleadings of Theodore; though she had no friends to control, and no contrariety of interests to per∣plex,
<PB N="34" REF="33"/>
her she could not bring herself to consent thus hastily to a marriage with a man, of whom she had little knowledge, and to whose fa∣mily and connections she had no sort of intro∣duction. At length, she entreated he would drop the subject, and the conversation for the remainder of the day was more general, yet still interesting.</P>
<P>That similarity of taste and opinion, which had at first attracted them, every moment now more fully disclosed. Their discourse was enriched by elegant litera∣ture, and endeared by mutual regard: Adeline had enjoyed few opportunities of reading, but the books to which she had access, operating upon a mind eager for knowledge, and upon a taste pecu∣liarly sensible of the beautiful and the ele∣gant, had impressed all their excellencies upon her understanding. Theodore had re∣ceived from nature many of the qualities of genius, and from education all that it could bestow; to these were added, a noble inde∣pendency of spirit, a feeling heart, and man∣ners, which partook of a happy mixture of dignity and sweetness.</P>
<P>In the evening, one of the officers, who, upon the representation of the serjeant, was sent by the persons employed to prosecute military criminals, arrived at the village,
<PB N="35" REF="34"/>
and entering the apartment of Theodore, from which Adeline immediately withdrew, informed him, with an air of infinite impor∣tance, that he should set out on the following day for head-quarters. Theodore answered, that he was not able to bear the journey, and referred him to his physician; but the officer replied that he should take no such trouble, it being certain that the physician might be instructed what to say, and that he should begin his journey on the morrow. <Q REND="inline">"Here has been delay enough,"</Q> said he, <Q REND="inline">"already, and you will have sufficient bu∣siness on your hands when you reach head-quarters; for the serjeant, whom you have severely wounded, intends to appear against you; and this, with the offence you have committed by deserting your post."</Q></P>
<P>Theodore's eyes flashed fire, <Q REND="inline">"Desert∣ing!"</Q> said he, rising from his seat, and darting a look of menace at his ac∣cuser, <Q REND="inline">"who dares to brand me with the name of deserter?"</Q> But instantly re∣collecting how much his conduct had ap∣peared to justify the accusation, he en∣deavoured to stifle his emotions, and, with a firm voice and composed manner, said, that when he reached head-quarters, he should beready to answer whatever might be brought against him, but that till then he
<PB N="36" REF="35"/>
should be silent. The boldness of the officer was repressed by the spirit and dignity with which Theodore spoke these words, and mut∣tering a reply, that was scarcely audible, he left the room.</P>
<P>Theodore sat musing on the danger of his situation: he knew that he had much to apprehend from the peculiar circum∣stances attending his abrupt departure from his regiment, it having been stationed in a garrison town upon the Spanish fron∣tiers; where the discipline was very severe, and from the power of his colonel, the Marquis de Montalt, whom pride and disap∣pointment would now rouse to vengeance, and, probably, render indefatigable in the accomplishment of his destruction. But his thoughts soon fled from his own danger to that of Adeline, and, in the consideration of this, all his fortitude forsook him: he could not support the idea of leaving her ex∣posed to the evils he foreboded, nor, indeed, of a separation so sudden as that which now threatened him; and when she again en∣tered the room, he renewed his solicitati∣ons for a speedy marriage, with all the arguments that tenderness and ingenuity could suggest.</P>
<P>Adeline, when she learned that he was to depart on the morrow, felt as if bereaved of her last comfort. All the horrors of his
<PB N="37" REF="36"/>
situation arose to her mind, and she turned from him in unutterable anguish. Consider∣ing her silence as a favourable presage, he repeated his entreaties that she would consent to be his, and thus give him a surety that their separation should not be eternal. Ade∣line sighed deeply to these words: <Q REND="inline">"And who can know that our separation will <HI>not</HI> be eternal,"</Q> said she, <Q REND="inline">"even if I could consent to the marriage you pro∣pose? But while you hear my deter∣mination, forbear to accuse me of in∣difference, for indifference towards you would, indeed, be a crime, after the services you have rendered me."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And is a cold sentiment of gratitude all that I must expect from you?"</Q> said Theodore. <Q REND="inline">"I know that you are going to distress me with a proof of your in∣difference, which you mistake for the suggestions of prudence; and that I shall be compelled to look, without reluctance, upon the evils that may shortly await me. Ah, Adeline! if you mean to reject this, perhaps, the last proposal which I can ever make to you, cease, at least, to deceive yourself with an idea that you love me; that delirium is fading even from my mind."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Can you then so soon forg t our con∣versation of this morning?"</Q> replied
<PB N="38" REF="37"/>
Adeline; <Q REND="inline">"and can you think so lightly of me as to believe I would profess a re∣gard, which I do not feel? If, indeed, you can believe this, I shall do well to for∣get that I ever made such an acknowledge∣ment, and you, that you heard it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Forgive me, Adeline, forgive the doubts and inconsistencies I have be∣trayed: let the anxieties of love, and the emergency of my circumstances, plead for me."</Q> Adeline, smiling faintly through her tears, held out her hand, which he seized and pressed to his lips. <Q REND="inline">"Yet do not drive me to despair by a rejection of my suit,"</Q> continued Theodore; <Q REND="inline">"think what I must suffer to leave you here destitute of friends and protection."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am thinking how I may avoid a situa∣tion so deplorable,"</Q> said Adeline. <Q REND="inline">"They say there is a convent, which receives boarders, within a few miles, and thither I wish to go."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"A convent!"</Q> rejoined Theodore, <Q REND="inline">"would you go to a convent? Do you know the persecutions you would be liable to; and that if the Marquis should discover you, there is little probability the superior would resist his authority, or, at least, his bribes?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"All this I have considered,"</Q> said
<PB N="39" REF="38"/>
Adeline, <Q REND="inline">"and am prepared to encounter it, rather than enter into an engagement, which, at this time, can be productive only of misery to us both."</Q></P>
<Q REND="inline">"Ah, Adeline! could you think thus, if you truly loved? I see myself about to be separated, and that, perhaps, for ever, from the object of my ten∣derest affections—and I cannot but express all the anguish I feel—I can∣not forbear to repeat every argument that may afford even the slightest pos∣sibility of altering your determination. But <HI>you,</HI> Adeline, <HI>you</HI> look with complacency upon a circumstance which tortures <HI>me</HI> with despair."</Q>
<P>Adeline, who had long strove to support her spirits in his presence, while she adhered to a reolution which reason suggested, but which the pleadings of her heart powerfully opposed, was unable longer to command her distress, and burst into tears. Theodore was in the same moment convinced of his error, and shocked at the grief he had occa∣sioned. He drew his chair towards her, and, taking her hand, again entreated her pardon, and endeavoured in the tenderest accents to soothe and comfort her.—<Q REND="inline">"What a wretch was I to cause you this distress, by ques∣tioning that with regard which I can no longer doubt you honour me! Forgive me,
<PB N="40" REF="39"/>
Adeline; say but you forgive me, and, whatever may be the pain of this separa∣tion, I will no longer oppose it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You have given me some pain,"</Q> said Adeline, <Q REND="inline">"but you have not offended me."—</Q>She then mentioned some farther par∣ticulars concerning the convent. Theodore endeavoured to conceal the distress which the approaching separation occasioned him, and to consult with her on these plans with composure. His judgment by degrees pre∣vailed over his passions, and he now per∣ceived that the plan she suggested would afford her best chance of security. He con∣sidered, what in the first agitation of his mind had escaped him, that he might be condemned upon the charges brought against him, and that his death, should they have been married, would not only deprive her of her protector, but leave her more immediate∣ly exposed to the designs of the Marquis, who would, doubtless, attend his trial. Astonished that he had not noticed this be∣fore, and shocked at the unwariness by which he might have betrayed her into so dangerous a situation, he became at once reconciled to the idea of leaving her in a convent. He could have wished to place her in the asylum of his own family, but the circumstances under which she must be introduced were so awkward and painful,
<PB N="41" REF="40"/>
and, above all, the distance at which they resided, would render a journey so highly dangerous for her, that he forbore to pro∣pose it. He entreated only that she would allow him to write to her; but recollecting that his letters might be a means of betray∣ing the place of her residence to the Mar∣quis, he checked himself: <Q REND="inline">"I must deny myself even this melancholy pleasure,"</Q> said he, <Q REND="inline">"lest my letters should discover your abode; yet how shall I be able to endure the impatience and uncertainty to which prudence condemns me! If you are in danger, I shall be ignorant of it; though, indeed, did I know it,"</Q> said he with a look of despair, <Q REND="inline">"I could not fly to save you. O exquisite misery! 'tis now only I perceive all the horrors of con∣finement—'tis now only that I under∣stand all the value of liberty!"</Q></P>
<P>His utterance was interrupted by the violent agitation of his mind; he rose from his chair, and walked with quick paces about the room. Adeline sat, overcome by the description which Theodore had given of his approaching situation, and by the consideration that she might remain in the most terrible suspense concerning his fate. She saw him in a pri∣son—pale—emaciated, and in chains:—she saw all the vengeance of the Marquis des∣cending upon him; and this for his noble
<PB N="42" REF="41"/>
exertions in her cause. Theodore, alarmed by the placid despair expressed in her counte∣nance, threw himself into a chair by her's, and, taking her hand, attempted to speak comfort to her, but the words faltered on his lips, and he could only bathe her hand with tears.</P>
<P>This mournful silence was interrupted by the arrival of the carriage at the inn, and Theodore, arising, went to the window that opened into the yard. The darkness of the night prevented his distinguishing the objects without, but a light now brought from the house shewed him a carriage and four, attended by several servants. Presently he saw a gen∣tleman, wrapped up in a roquelaure, alight and enter the inn, and in the next moment he heard the voice of the Marquis.</P>
<P>He had slown to support Adeline, who was sinking with terror, when the door opened, and the Marquis, followed by the officers and several servants, entered. Fury flashed from his eyes, as they glanced upon Theodore, who hung over Adeline with a look of fearful soli∣citude—<Q REND="inline">"Seize that traitor,"</Q> said he, tur∣ning to the officers; <Q REND="inline">"why have you suffered him to remain here so long?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am no traitor,"</Q> said Theodore, with a firm voice, and the dignity of conscious worth, <Q REND="inline">"but a defender of innocence, of
<PB N="43" REF="42"/>
one whom the treacherous Marquis de Montalt would destroy."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Obey your orders,"</Q> said the Marquis to the officers. Adeline shrieked, held faster by Theodore's arm, and entreated the men not to part them. <Q REND="inline">"Force only can effect it,"</Q> said Theodore, as he looked round for some instrument of defence, but he could see none, and in the same moment they surrounded and seized him. <Q REND="inline">"Dread every thing from my vengeance,"</Q> said the Marquis to Theo∣dore, as he caught the hand of Adeline, who had lost all power of resistance, and was scarcely sensible of what passed; <Q REND="inline">"dread every thing from my vengeance; you know you have deserved it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I defy your vengeance,"</Q> cried Theo∣dore, <Q REND="inline">"and dread only the pangs of conscience, which your power cannot inflict upon me, though your vices con∣demn you to its tortures."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Take him instantly from the room, and see that he is strongly fettered,"</Q> said the Marquis; <Q REND="inline">"he shall soon know what a criminal, who adds insolence to guilt, may suffer."—</Q>Theodore exclaiming. <Q REND="inline">"Oh Adeline! farewell!"</Q> was now forced out of the room; while Adeline, whose tor∣pid senses were roused by his voice and his last looks, fell at the feet of the Marquis, and with tears of agony implored compassion for
<PB N="44" REF="43"/>
Theodore: but her pleadings for his rival served only to irritate the pride and exaspe∣rate the hatred of the Marquis. He de∣nounced vengeance on his head, and im∣precations too dreadful for the spirits of Ade∣line, whom he compelled to rise; and then, endeavouring to stifle the emotlons of rage, which the presence of Theodore had excit∣ed, he began to address her with his usual expressions of admiration.</P>
<P>The wretched Adeline, who, regardless of what he said, still continued to plead for her unhappy lover, was at length alarm∣ed by the returning rage which the counte∣nance of the Marquis expressed, and, ex∣erting all her remaining strength, she sprung from his grasp towards the door of the room; but he seized her hand before she could reach it, and, regardless of her shrieks, bring∣ing her back to her chair, was going to speak, when voices were heard in the pas∣sage, and immediately the landlord and his wife, whom Adeline's cries had alarmed, entered the apartment. The Marquis, turn∣ing furiously to them, demanded what they wanted; but not waiting for their an∣swer, he bade them attend him, and quit∣ting the room, she heard the door locked upon her.</P>
<P>Adeline now ran to the windows, which were unfastened, and opened into the inn-<PB N="45" REF="44"/>
yard.
All was dark and silent. She call∣ed aloud for help, but no person appeared; and the windows were so high, that it was impossible to escape unassisted. She walked about the room in an agony of terror and distress, now stopping to listen, and fancy∣ing she heard voices disputing below, and now quickening her steps, as suspense in∣creased the agitation of her mind.</P>
<P>She had continued in this state for near half an hour, when she suddenly heard a violent noise in the lower part of the house, which increased till all was uproar and con∣fusion. People passed quickly through the passages, and doors were frequently opened and shut. She called, but received no an∣swer. It immediately occurred to her, that Theodore, having heard her screams, had attempted to come to her assistance, and that the bustle had been occasioned by the opposition of the officers. Knowing their fierceness and cruelty, she was seized with dreadful apprehensions for the life of Theo∣dore.</P>
<P>A confused uproar of voices now sounded from below, and the screams of women convinced her there was fighting; she even thought she heard the clashing of swords; the image of Theodore, dying by the hands of the Marquis, now rose to her imagina∣tion, and the terrors of suspense became
<PB N="46" REF="45"/>
almost insupportable. She made a desperate effort to force the door, and again called for help, but her trembling hands were powerless, and every person in the house seemed to be too much engaged even to hear her. A loud shriek now pierced her ears, and, amidst the tumult that followed, she clearly distinguished deep groans. This confirmation of her fears deprived her of all her remaining spirits, and growing faint, she sunk almost lifeless into a chair near the door. The uproar gradually subsided till all was still, but nobody returned to her. Soon after she heard voices in the yard, but she had no power to walk across the room, even to ask the questions she wished, yet seared, to have answered.</P>
<P>About a quarter of an hour elapsed, when the door was unlocked, and the hostess appeared with a countenanee as pale as death. <Q REND="inline">"For God's sake,"</Q> said Adeline, <Q REND="inline">"tell me what has happened? Is he wounded? Is he killed?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"He is not dead, Ma'amselle, but—</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"He is dying then?—tell me where he is—let me go."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Stop, Ma'amselle,"</Q> cried the hostess, <Q REND="inline">"you are to stay here, I only want the hartshorn out of that cupboard there."</Q> Adeline tried to escape by the door, but

the hostess, pushing her aside, locked it, and went down stairs.</P>
<P>Adeline's distress now entirely overcame her, and she sat motionless, and scarcely conscious that she existed, till roused by a sound of footsteps near the door, which was again opened, and three men, whom she knew to be the Marquis's servants, entered. She had sufficient recollection to repeat the questions she had asked the land∣lady, but they answered only that she must come with them, and that a chaise was wait∣ing for her at the door. Still she urged her questions. <Q REND="inline">"Tell me if he lives,"</Q> cried she.—<Q REND="inline">"Yes, Ma'amselle, he is alive, but he is terribly wounded, and the surgeon is just come to him."</Q> As they spoke they hurried her along the passage, and without noticing her entreaties and supplications to know whither she was going, they had reached the foot of the stairs, when her cries brought several people to the door. To these the hostess related, that the lady was the wife of a gentleman just arrived, who had overtaken her in her slight with a gallant; and account which the Marquis's servants corroborated. <Q REND="inline">"'Tis the gentleman who has just fought the duel,"</Q> added the hostess, <Q REND="inline">"and it was on her ac∣count."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="47"/>
Adeline, partly disdaining to take any notice of this artful story, and partly from her desire to know the particulars of what had happened, contented herself with repeat∣ing her inquiries; to which one of the spectators at last replied, that the gentleman was desperately wounded. The Marquis's people would now have hurried her into the chaise, but she sunk lifeless in their arms, and her condition so interested the humanity of the spectators, that, notwith∣standing their belief of what had been said, they opposed the effort made to carry her, senseless as she was, into the carriage.</P>
<P>She was at length taken into a room, and, by proper applications, restored to her senses. There she so earnestly besought an explanation of what had happened, that the hostess acquainted her with some par∣ticulars of the late rencounter. <Q REND="inline">"When the gentleman that was ill heard your screams, Madam,"</Q> said she, <Q REND="inline">"he became quite outrageous, as they tell me, and nothing could pacify him. The Marquis, for they say he is a Marquis, but you know best, was then in the room with my husband and I, and when he heard the uproar, he went down to see what was the matter; and when he came into the room where the Captain was, he found him struggling with the ser∣jeant.
<PB N="49" REF="48"/>
Then the Captain was more outrageous than ever; and notwith∣standing he had one leg chained, and no sword, he contrived to get the ser∣jeant's cutlass out of the scabbard, and immediately flew at the Marquis, and wounded him desperately; upon which he was secured."—</Q><Q REND="inline">"It is the Marquis then who is wounded,"</Q> said Adeline; <Q REND="inline">"the other gentleman is not hurt?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No, not he,"</Q> replied the hostess; <Q REND="inline">"but he will smart for it by and bye, for the Marquis swears he will do for him."</Q> Adeline, for a moment, forgot all her mis∣fortunes and all her danger in thankfulness for the immediate escape of Theodore; and she was proceeding to make some farther inquiries concerning him, when the Mar∣quis's servants entered the room, and declar∣ed they could wait no longer. Adeline, now awakened to a sense of the evils with which she was threatened, endea∣voured to win the pity of the hostess, who, however, was, or affected to be, convinced of the truth of the Marquis's story, and, therefore, insensible to all she could urge. Again she addressed his servants, but in vain; they would nei∣ther suffer her to remain longer at the inn, or inform her whither she was going; but, in the presence of several persons,
<PB N="50" REF="49"/>
already prejudiced by the injurious as∣sertions of the hostess, Adeline was hur∣ried into the chaise, and her conductors mounting their horses, the whole party was very soon beyond the village.</P>
<P>Thus ended Adeline's share of an ad∣venture, begun with a prospect not only of security, but of happiness; an ad∣venture, which had attached her more closely to Theodore, and shewn him to be more worthy of her love; but which, at the same time, had distressed her by new disappointment, produced the im∣prisonment of her generous and now∣adored lover, and delivered both him∣self and her into the power of a rival, irritated by delay, contempt, and oppo∣sition.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE surgeon of the place, having examin∣ed the Marquis's wound, gave him an immediate opinion upon it, and ordered
<PB N="51" REF="50"/>
that he should be put to bed: but the Mar∣quis, ill as he was, had scarcely any other apprehension than that of losing Adeline, and declared he should be able to begin his journey in a few hours. With this in∣tention, he had began to give orders for keeping horses in readiness, when the surgeon persisting most seriously, and even passionately to exclaim, that his life would be the sacrifice of his rashness, he was carried to a bed-chamber, where his valet alone was permitted to attend him.</P>
<P>This man, the convenient confidant of all his intrigues, had been the chief instrument in assisting his designs con∣cerning Adeline, and was indeed the very person who had brought her to the Marquis's villa on the borders of the forest. To him the Marquis gave his farther directions concerning her; and, foreseeing the inconvenience, as well as the danger of detaining her at the inn, he had ordered him, with several other servants, to carry her away immediately in a hired carriage. The valet having gone to execute his orders, the Marquis was left to his own reflections, and to the violence of contending passions.</P>
<P>The reproaches and continued oppo∣sition of Theodore, the favoured lover of Adeline, exasperated his pride, and
<PB N="52" REF="51"/>
roused all his malice. He could not for a moment consider this opposition, which was in some respects successful, without feeling an excess of indignation and inveteracy, such as the prospect of a speedy revenge could alone enable him to support.</P>
<P>When he had discovered Adeline's escape from the villa, his surprize at first equalled his disappointment; and, after exhausting the paroxysms of his rage upon his domestics, he dispatched them all different ways in pursuit of her, going himself to the abbey, in the faint hope, that, destitute as she was of other succour, she might have fled thither. La Motte, however, being as much surprized as himself, and as ignorant of rhe route which Adeline had taken, he returned to the villa, impa∣tient of intelligence, and found some of his servants arrived, without any news of Adeline, and those who came afterwards were as successless as the first.</P>
<P>A few days after, a letter from the Lieutenant Colonel of the regiment in∣formed him, that Theodore had quitted his company, and had been for some time absent, nobody knew where. This in∣formation, confirming a suspicion which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ad frequently occurred to him, that Theodore, had been by some means, or
<PB N="53" REF="52"/>
other, instrumental in the escape of Adeline, all his other passions became for a time subservient to his revenge, and he gave or∣ders for the immediate pursuit and appre∣hension of Theodore<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> but Theodore, in the mean time, had been overtaken and secured.</P>
<P>It was in consequence of having formerly observed the growing partiality between him and Adeline, and of intelligence received from La Motte, who had noticed their in∣terview in the forest, that the Marquis had resolved to remove a rival so dangerous to his love, and so likely to be informed of his designs. He had therefore told Theodore, in a manner as plausible as he could, that it would be necessary for him to join the re∣giment; a notice which affected him only as it related to Adeline, and which seemed the less extraordinary, as he had already been at the villa a much longer time than was usual with the officers invited by the Marquis. Theodore, indeed, very well knew the character of the Marquis, and had accepted his invitation rather from an un∣willingness to shew any disrespect to his Colonel by a refusal, than from a sanguine expectation of pleasure.</P>
<P>From the men who had apprehended Theo∣dore, the Marquis received the information, which had enabled him to pursue and
<PB N="54" REF="53"/>
recover Adeline; but, though he had now ef∣fected this, he was internally a prey to the corrosive effects of disappointed passion and exasperated pride. The anguish of his wound was almost forgotten in that of his mind, and every pang he felt seemed to encrease his thirst of revenge, and to recoil with new tor∣ture upon his heart. While he was in this state, he heard the voice of the innocent Adeline imploring protection; but her cries excited in him neither pity or remorse; and when, soon after, the carriage drove away, and he was certain both that she was secured and Theodore was wretched, he seemed to feel some cessation of mental pain.</P>
<P>Theodore, indeed, did suffer all that a vir∣tuous mind, labouring under oppression so severe, could feel; but he was, at least, free from those inveterate and malignant passions which tore the bosom of the Marquis, and which inflict upon the possessor a punish∣ment more severe than any they can prompt him to imagine for another. What indig∣nation he might feel towards the Marquis, was at this time secondary to his anxiety for Adeline. His captivity was painful, as it pre∣vented his seeking a just and honourable re∣venge; but it was dreadful, as it withheld him from attempting the rescue of her whom he loved more than life.</P>
<P>When he heard the wheels of the carriage
<PB N="55" REF="54"/>
that contained her drive off, he felt an agony of despair which almost overcame his reason. Even the stern hearts of the soldiers who at∣tended him were not wholly insensible to his wretchedness, and by venturing to blame the conduct of the Marquis, they endea∣voured to console their prisoner. The phy∣sician, who was just arrived, entered the room during this paroxysm of his distress, and, both feeling and expressing much con∣cern at his condition, inquired with strong surprize why he had been thus precipitately removed to a room so very unfit for his re∣ception?</P>
<P>Theodore explained to him the reason of this, of the distress he suffered, and of the chains by which he was disgraced; and per∣ceiving the physician listened to him with attention and compassion, he became desi∣rous of acquainting him with some farther particulars, for which purpose he desired the soldiers to leave the room. The men, com∣plying with his request, stationed themselves on the outside of the door.</P>
<P>He then related all the particulars of the late transaction, and of his connection with the Marquis. The physician attended to his narrative with deep concern, and his countenance frequently expressed strong agita∣tion. When Theodore concluded, he remained for some time silent and lost in thought; at
<PB N="56" REF="55"/>
length, awaking from his reverie, he said, <Q REND="inline">"I fear your situation is desperate. The character of the Marquis is too well known to suffer him either to be loved or respected; from such a man you have nothing to hope, for he has scarcely any thing to fear. I wish it was in my power to serve you, but I see no possibility of it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Alas!"</Q> said Theodore, <Q REND="inline">"my situ∣ation is indeed desperate, and—for that suffering angel"—</Q>deep sobs in∣terrupted his voice, and the violence of his agitation would not allow him to proceed. The physician could only express the sym∣pathy he felt for his distress, and entreat him to be more calm, when a servant en∣tered the room from the Marquis, who de∣sired to see the physician immediately. After some time he said he would attend the Marquis, and having endeavoured to attain a degree of composure, which he found it difficult to assume, he wrung the hand of Theodore and quitted the room, pro∣mising to return before he left the house.</P>
<P>He found the Marquis much agitated both in body and mind, and rather more ap∣prehensive for the consequences of the wound than he had expected. His anxi∣ety for Theodore now suggested a plan, by the execution of which he hoped he might be able to serve him. Having felt his pa∣tient's
<PB N="57" REF="56"/>
pulse, and asked some questions, he assumed a very serious look, when the Marquis, who watched every turn of his countenance, desired he would without he∣sitation, speak his opinion.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am sorry to alarm you, my Lord, but here is some reason for apprehension: how long is it since you received the wound?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Good God! there is danger then!"</Q> cried the Marquis, adding some bitter execrations against Theodore.—<Q REND="inline">"There certainly <HI>is</HI> danger;"</Q> replied the physi∣cian, <Q REND="inline">"a few hours may enable me to de∣termine its degree."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"A few hours, Sir!"</Q> interrupted the Marquis; <Q REND="inline">"a few hours!"</Q> The physician entreated him to be more calm. <Q REND="inline">"Confusion!"</Q> cried the Marquis, <Q REND="inline">"A man in health may, with great composure, entreat a dying man to be calm. Theodore will be broke upon the wheel for it, however."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You mistake me, Sir,"</Q> said the phy∣sician, <Q REND="inline">"if I believe you a dying man, or, indeed, <HI>very</HI> near death, I should not have spoken as I did. But it is of consequence I should know how long the wound has been inflicted."</Q> The Marquis's terror now began to subside, and he gave a circumstantial account of the affray with Theodore, representing
<PB N="58" REF="57"/>
that he had been basely used in an affair, where his own conduct had been perfectly just and humane. The physician heard this relation with great coolness, and when it concluded, without making any comment upon it, told the Marquis he would prescribe a medicine, which he wished him to take im∣mediately.</P>
<P>The Marquis, again alarmed by the gra∣vity of his manner, entreated he would de∣clare most seriously, whether he thought him in immediate danger. The physician hesitated, and the anxiety of the Marquis increased: <Q REND="inline">"It is of consequence,"</Q> said he, <Q REND="inline">"that I should know my exact situa∣tion."</Q> The physician then said, that if he had any worldly affairs to settle, it would be as well to attend to them, for that it was impossible to say what might be the event.</P>
<P>He then turned the discourse and said, he had just been with the young officer under arrest, who, he hoped, would not be removed at present, as such a procedure must endanger his life. The Marquis uttered a dreadful oath, and, cursing Theodore for having brought him to his present condition, said, he should depart with the guard that very night. Against the cruelty of this sen∣tence, the physician ventured to expostulate; and endeavouring to awaken the Marquis to a sense of humanity, pleaded earnestly for
<PB N="59" REF="58"/>
Theodore. But these entreaties and argu∣ments seemed, by displaying to the Marquis a part of his own character, to rouse his re∣sentment, and re-kindle all the violence of his passions.</P>
<P>The physician at length withdrew in des∣pondency, after promising, at the Marquis's request, not to leave the inn. He had hoped, by aggravating his danger, to obtain some advantages, both for Adeline and Theodore, but the plan had quite a contrary effect; for the apprehension of death, so dreadful to the guilty mind of the Marquis, instead of awaken∣ing penitence, increased his desire of ven∣geance against the man, who had brought him to such a situation. He determined to have Adeline conveyed, where Theo∣dore, should he by any accident escape, could never obtain her; and thus to se∣cure to himself, at least, some means of revenge. He knew, however, that when Theodore was once safely conveyed to his regiment, his destruction was certain, for should he even be acquitted of the inten∣tention of deserting, he would be con∣demned for having assaulted his superior officer.</P>
<P>The physician returned to the room where Theodore was confined. The violence of his distress was now subsided into a stern des∣pair, more dreadful than the vehemence
<PB N="60" REF="59"/>
which had lately possessed him. The guard, in compliance with his request, having left the room, the phy<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ician repeated to him some part of his conversation with the Mar∣quis. Theodore, after expressing his thanks, said, he had nothing more to hope. For himself he felt little; it was for his family, and for Adeline he suffered. He enquired what route she had taken, and though he had no prospect of deriving advantage from the information, desired the physician to assist him in obtaining it; but the landlord and his wife either were, or affected to be, ignorant of the matter, and it was in vain to apply to any other person.</P>
<P>The serjeant now entered with orders from the Marquis for the immediate departure of Theodore, who heard the message with com∣posure, though the physician could not help expressing his indignation at this precipitate removal, and his dread of the consequences that might attend it. Theodore had scarcely time to declare his gratitude for the kindness of this valuable friend, before the soldiers entered the room to conduct him to the car∣riage in waiting. As he bade him farewell, Theodore slipped his purse into his hand, and turning abruptly away, told the soldiers to lead on; but the physician stopped him, and refused the present with such serious warmth, that he was compelled to resume
<PB N="61" REF="60"/>
it: he wrung the hand of his new friend, and, being unable to speak, hurried away. The whole party immediately set off, and the unhappy Theodore was left to the remem∣brance of his past hopes and sufferings, to his anxiety for the fate of Adeline, the contem∣plation of his present wretchedness, and the apprehension of what might be reserved for him in future. For himself, indeed, he saw nothing but destruction, and was only re∣lieved from total despair, by a feeble hope that she, whom he loved better than himself, might one time enjoy that happiness, of which he did not venture to look for a parti∣cipation.</P>

<P>MEANWHILE the persecuted Adeline continued to travel, with little interruption, all night. Her mind suffered such a tumult of grief, regret, despair, and terror, that she could not be said to think. The Marquis's valet, who had placed himself in the chaise with her, at first seemed inclined to talk, but her inattention soon silenced him, and left her to the indulgence of her own mi∣sery.</P>
<P>They seemed to travel through obscure lanes and bye-ways, along which the car∣riage drove as furiously as the darkness would
<PB N="63" REF="62"/>
permit: when the dawn appeared, she per∣ceived herself on the borders of a forest, and renewed her entreaties to know whither she was going. The man replied, he had no orders to tell, but she would soon see. Adeline, who had hitherto supposed they were carrying her to the villa, now began to doubt it; and as every place appeared less terrible to her imagination than that, her despair began to abate, and she thought only of the devoted Theodore, whom she knew to be the victim of malice and revenge.</P>
<P>They now entered upon the forest, and it occurred to her that she was going to the abbey; for though she had no remembrance of the scenery, through which she passed, it was not the less probable that this was the forest of Fontangville, whose boundaries were by much too extensive to have come within the circle of her former walks. This con∣jecture revived a terror, little inferior to that occasioned by the idea of going to the villa, for at the abbey she would be equal∣ly in the power of the Marquis, and also in that of her cruel enemy, La Motte. Her mind revolted at the picture her fancy drew, and as the carriage moved under the shades, she threw from the window a look of eager inquiry for some object which might con∣firm, or destroy her present surmise: she did not long look, before an opening in the
<PB N="64" REF="63"/>
forest shewed her the distant towers of the abbey—<Q REND="inline">"I am, indeed lost then!"</Q> said she, bursting into tears.</P>
<P>They were soon at the foot of the lawn, and Peter was seen running to open the gate, at which the carriage stopped. When he saw Adeline, he looked surprized and made an effort to speak, but the chaise now drove up to the abbey, where, at the door of the hall, La Motte himself appeared. As he advanced to take her from the carriage, an universal trembling seized her; it was with the utmost difficulty she supported her∣self, and for some moments she neither ob∣served his countenance, nor heard his voice. He offered his arm to assist her into the abbey, which she at first refused, but having totter∣ed a few paces, was obliged to accept; they then entered the vaulted room, where, sinking into a chair, a flood of tears came to her relief. La Motte did not interrupt the silence, which continued for some time, but paced the room in seeming agitation. When Adeline was sufficiently recovered to notice external objects, she observed his counte∣nance, and there read the tumult of his soul, while he was struggling to assume a firmness, which his better feelings opposed.</P>
<P>La Motte now took her hand, and would have led her from the room, but she stopped, and, with a kind of desperate courage, made
<PB N="65" REF="64"/>
an effort to engage him to pity, and to save her. He interrupted her; <Q REND="inline">"It is not in my power,"</Q> said he, in a voice of emotion; <Q REND="inline">"I am not master of myself, or my conduct; inquire no farther—it is sufficient for you to know that I pity you; more I cannot do."</Q> He gave her no time to re∣ply, but, taking her hand, led her to the stairs of the tower, and from thence to the chamber she had formerly occupied.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Here you must remain for the pre∣sent,"</Q> said he, <Q REND="inline">"in a confinement, which is, perhaps, almost as involun∣tary on my part as it can be on yours. I am willing to render it as easy as pos∣ble, and have, therefore, ordered some books to be brought you."</Q></P>
<P>Adeline made an effort to speak, but he hurried from the room, seemingly ashamed of the part he had undertaken, and unwil∣ling to trust himself with her tears. She heard the door of the chamber locked, and then, looking towards the windows, per∣ceived they were secured: the door that led to the other apartments was also fastened. Such preparation for security shocked her, and, hopeless as she had long believed her∣self, she now perceived her mind to sink deeper in despair. When the tears she shed had somewhat relieved her, and her thoughts could turn from the subjects of
<PB N="66" REF="65"/>
her immediate concern, she was thankful for the total seclusion allotted her, since it would spare her the pain she must feel in the presence of Monsieur and Madame La Motte, and allow the unrestrained indul∣gence of her own sorrow and reflection; reflection which, however distressing, was preserable to the agony inflicted on the mind, when agitated by care and fear, it is ob∣liged to assume an appearance of tranquil∣lity.</P>
<P>In about a quarter of an hour, her cham∣ber door was unlocked, and Annette appear∣ed with refreshments and books: she ex∣pressed satisfaction at seeing Adeline again, but seemed fearful of speaking, knowing, probably, that it was contrary to the orders of La Motte, who, she said, was waiting at the bottom of the stairs. When Annette was gone, Adeline took some refreshment, which was indeed necessary; for she had tasted nothing since she left the inn. She was pleased, but not surprized, that Ma∣dame La Motte did not appear, who, it was evident, shunned her from a consciousness of her own ungenerous conduct, a conscious∣ness, which offered some presumption, that she was still not wholly unfriendly to her. She reflected upon the words of La Motte, <Q REND="inline">"I am not master of myself, or my conduct,"</Q> and though they afforded her no hope, she
<PB N="67" REF="66"/>
derived some comfort, poor as it was, from the belief that he pitied her. After some time spent in miserable reflection and various conjectures, her long-agitated spirits seem∣ed to demand repose, and she laid down to sleep.</P>
<P>Adeline slept quietly for several hours, and awoke with a mind refreshed and tran∣quillized. To prolong this temporary peace, and to prevent, therefore, the intrusion of her own thoughts, she examined the books La Motte had sent her: among these she found some that in happier times had elevated her mind and interested her heart; their effect was now weakened, they were still, however, able to soften for a time the sense of her misfortunes.</P>
<P>But this Lethean medicine to a wound∣ed mind was but a temporary blessing, the entrance of La Motte dissolved the illusions of the page, and awakened her to a sense of her own situation. He came with food, and having placed it on the table, left the room without speaking. Again she endea∣voured to read, but his appearance had bro∣ken the enchantment—bitter reflection re∣turned to her mind, and brought with it the image of Theodore—of Theodore lost to her for ever!</P>
<P>La Motte, mean while, experienced all the terrors that could be inflicted by a con∣science
<PB N="68" REF="67"/>
not wholly hardened to guilt. He had been led on by passion to dissipation—and from dissipation to vice; but having once touched the borders of infamy, the progres∣sive steps followed each other fast, and he now saw himself the pander of a villain, and the betrayer of an innocent girl, whom every plea of justice and humanity called upon him to protect. He contemplated his picture—he shrunk from it, but he could change its deformity only by an effort too nobly daring for a mind already effeminated by vice. He viewed the dangerous labyrinth into which he was led, and perceived, as if for the first time, the progression of his guilt; from this labyrinth he weakly imagined far∣ther guilt could alone extricate him. In∣stead of employing his mind upon the means of saving Adeline from destruction, and him∣self from being instrumental to it, he endea∣voured only to lull the pangs of conscience and to persuade himself into a belief that he must proceed in the course he had begun. He knew himself to be in the power of the Marquis, and he dreaded that power more than the sure, though distant punishment that awaits upon guilt. The honour of Ade∣line and the quiet of his own conscience he consented to barter for a few years of exis∣tence.</P>
<P>He was ignorant of the present illness of
<PB N="69" REF="68"/>
the Marquis, or he would have perceived that there was a chance of escaping the threa∣tened punishment at a price less enormous than infamy, and he would, perhaps, have endeavoured to save Adeline and himself by flight. But the Marquis, foreseeing the pos∣sibility of this, had ordered his servants carefully to conceal the circumstance which detained him, and to acquaint La Motte that he should be at the abbey in a few days, at the same time directing his valet to await him there. Adeline, as he expected, had neither inclination nor opportunity to men∣tion it, and thus La Motte remained igno∣rant of the circumstance, which might have preserved him from farther guilt and Adeline from misery.</P>
<P>Most unwillingly had La Motte made his wife acquainted with the action, which had made him absolutely dependent upon the will of the Marquis, but the perturbation of his mind partly betrayed him: frequently in his sleep he muttered incoherent sentences, and frequently would start from his slumber, and call, in passionate exclamation, upon Adeline. These instances of a disturbed mind had alarmed and terrified Madame La Motte, who watched while he slept and soon gathered from his words a confused idea of the Marquis's designs.</P>
<P>She hinted her suspicions to La Motte,
<PB N="70" REF="69"/>
who reproved her for having entertained them, but his manner, instead of repres∣sing, increased her fears for Adeline; fears, which the conduct of the Marquis soon confirmed. On the night that he slept at the abbey, it had occurred to her, that whatever scheme was in agitation would now most probably be discussed, and anxiety for Adeline made her stoop to a meanness, which, in other circumstances, would have been despicable. She quitted her room, and, concealing herself in an apartment ad∣joining that in which she had left the Marquis and her husband, listened to their discourse. It turned upon the subject she had expected, and disclosed to her the full extent of their designs. Terrified for Adeline, and shocked at the guilty weakness of La Motte, she was for some time incapable of thinking, or de∣termining how to proceed. She knew her husband to be under great obligation to the Marquis, whose territory thus afforded him a shelter from the world, and that it was in the power of the former to betray him into the hands of his enemies. She believed also that the Marquis would do this, if provoked, yet she thought, upon such an occasion, La Motte might find some way ofappeasing the Marquis, without subjecting himself to dis∣honour. After some farther reflection, her mind became more composed, and she re∣turned
<PB N="71" REF="70"/>
to her chamber, where La Motte soon followed. Her spirits, however, were not now in a state to encounter either his displeasure, or his opposition, which she had too much reason to expect, whenever she should mention the subject of her con∣cern, and she, therefore, resolved not to notice it till the morrow.</P>
<P>On the morrow, she told La Motte all he had uttered in his dreams, and mention∣ed other circumstances, which convinced him it was in vain any longer to deny the truth of her apprehensions. His wife then represented to him how possible it was to avoid the infamy, into which he was about to plunge, by quitting the territories of the Marquis, and pleaded so warmly for Adeline, that La Motte, in sullen silence, appeared to meditate upon the plan His thoughts were, however, very differently engaged. He was conscious of having de∣served from the Marquis a dreadful punish∣ment, and knew that if he exasperated him by refusing to acquiesce with his wishes, he had little to expect from flight, for the eye of justice and revenge would pursue him with indefatigable research.</P>
<P>La Motte meditated how to break this to his wife, for he perceived that there was no other method of counteracting her vir∣tuous compassion for Adeline, and the dan∣gerous
<PB N="72" REF="71"/>
consequences to be expected from it, than by opposing it with terror for his safe∣ty, and this could be done only by shew∣ing her the full extent of the evils that must attend the resentment of the Marquis. Vice had not yet so entirely darkened his con∣science, but that the blush of shame stained his cheek, and his tongue faltered when he would have told his guilt. At length, find∣ing it impossible to mention particulars, he told her that, on account of an affair, which no entreaties should ever induce him to explain, his life was in the power of the Marquis. <Q REND="inline">"You see the alternative,"</Q> said he, <Q REND="inline">"take your choice of evils, and, if you can, tell Adeline of her danger, and sacrifice my life to save her from a situ∣ation, which many would be ambitious to obtain."—</Q>Madame La Motte, con∣demned to the horrible alternative of per∣mitting the seduction of innocence, or of dooming her husband to destruction, suffer∣ed a distraction of thought, which defied all controul. Perceiving, however, that an opposition to the designs of the Marquis would ruin La Motte and avail Adeline little, she determined to yield and endure in silence.</P>
<P>At the time when Adeline was planning her escape from the abbey, the significant looks of Peter had led La Motte to suspect
<PB N="73" REF="72"/>
the truth and to observe them more close∣ly. He had seen them separate in the hall in apparent confusion, and had afterwards observed them conversing together in the cloisters. Circumstances so unusual left him not a doubt that Adeline had discovered her danger, and was concerting with Peter some means of escape. Affecting, there∣fore, to be informed of the whole affair, he charged Peter with treachery towards himself, and threatened him with the ven∣geance of the Marquis if he did not disclose all he knew. The menace intimidated Pe∣ter, and, supposing that all chance of as∣sisting Adeline was gone, he made a cir∣cumstantial confession, and promised to for∣bear acquainting Adeline with the discovery of the scheme. In this promise he was se∣conded by inclination, for he feared to meet the displeasure, which Adeline, believing he had betrayed her, might express.</P>
<P>On the evening of the day, on which Adeline's intended escape was discovered, the Marquis designed to come to the abbey, and it had been agreed that he should then take Adeline to his villa. La Motte had immediately perceived the advantage of per∣mitting Adeline to repair, in the belief of being undiscovered, to the tomb. It would prevent much disturbance and opposition, and spare himself the pain he must feel in
<PB N="74" REF="73"/>
her presence, when she should know that he had betrayed her. A servant of the Mar∣quis might go, at the appointed hour, to the tomb, and wrapt in the disguise of night, might take her quietly thence in the character of Peter. Thus, without resis∣tance, she would be carried to the villa, nor discover her mistake till it was too late to prevent its consequence.</P>
<P>When the Marquis did arrive, La Motte, who was not so much intoxicated by the wine he had drank, as to forget his pru∣dence, informed him of what had happen∣ed and what he had planned, and the Mar∣quis approving it, his servant was made ac∣quainted with the signal, which afterwards betrayed Adeline to his power.</P>
<P>A deep consciousness of the unworthy neutrality she had observed in Adeline's con∣cerns, made Madame La Motte anxiously avoid seeing her now that she was again in the abbey. Adeline understood this conduct, and she rejoiced that she was spared the an∣guish of meeting her as an enemy, whom she had once considered as a friend. Several days now passed in solitude, in miserable retrospection, and dreadful expectation. The perilous situation of Theodore was al∣most the constant subject of her thoughts. Often did she breathe an agonizing wish for his safety, and often look round the sphere
<PB N="75" REF="74"/>
of possibility in search of hope: but hope had almost left the horizon of her prospect, and when it did appear, it sprung only from the death of the Marquis, whose vengeance threatened most certain destruction.</P>
<P>The Marquis, mean while, lay at the inn at Baux, in a state of very doubtful re∣covery. The physician and surgeon, nei∣ther of whom he would dismiss, nor suffer to leave the village, proceeded upon con∣trary principles, and the good effect of what the one prescribed, was frequently counter∣acted by the injudicious treatment of the other. Humanity alone prevailed on the physician to continue his attendance. The malady of the Marquis was also heightened by the impatience of his temper, the ter∣rors of death, and the irritation of his pas∣sions. One moment he believed himself dy∣ing, another he could scarcely be prevented from attempting to follow Adeline to the abbey. So various were the fluctuations of his mind, and so rapid the schemes that suc∣ceeded each other, that his passions were in a continual state of conflict. The phy∣sician attempted to persuade him, that his recovery greatly depended upon tranquillity, and to prevail upon him to attempt, at least, some command of his feelings, but he was soon silenced, in hopeless disgust, by the impatient answers of the Marquis.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="75"/>
At length the servant, who had carried off Adeline, returned, and the Marquis having ordered him into his chamber, asked so many questions in a breath, that the man knew not which to answer. At length he pulled a folded paper from his pocket, which he said had been dropped in the chaise by Mademoiselle Adeline, and as he thought his lordship would like to see it, he had ta∣ken care of it. The Marquis stretched forth his hand with eagerness and received a note addressed to Theodore. On perceiving the superscription, the agitation of jealous rage for a moment overcame him, and he held it in his hand unable to open it.</P>
<P>He, however, broke the seal, and found it to be a note of inquiry, written by Adeline to Theodore during his illness, and which, from some accident she had been prevented from sending him. The tender solicitude it expressed for his recovery stung the soul of the Marquis, and drew from him a com∣parison of her feelings on the illness of his rival and that of himself. <Q REND="inline">"She could be solicitous for his recovery,"</Q> said he, <Q REND="inline">"but for mine, she only dreads it."</Q> As if willing to prolong the pain this little billet had excited, he then read it again. Again he cursed his fate and execrated his rival, giving himself up, as usual, to the tran∣sports of his passion. He was going to
<PB N="77" REF="76"/>
throw it from him, when his eyes caught the seal, and he looked earnestly at it. His anger seemed now to have subsided, he de∣posited the note carefully in his pocket book, and was, for some time, lost in thought.</P>
<P>After many days of hopes and fears, the strength of his constitution overcame his ill∣ness, and he was well enough to write se∣veral letters, one of which he immediately sent off to prepare La Motte for his recep∣tion. The same policy, which had prompt∣ed him to conceal his illness from La Motte, now urged him to say, what he knew would not happen, that he should reach the abbey on the day after his servant. He repeated this injunction, that Adeline should be strictly guarded, and renewed his pro∣mises of reward for the future services of La Motte.</P>
<P>La Motte, to whom each succeeding day had brought new surprize and perplexity concerning the absence of the Marquis, re∣ceived this notice with uneasiness, for he had begun to hope that the Marquis had altered his intentions concerning Adeline, being either engaged in some new adven∣ture, or obliged to visit his estates in some distant province: he would have been wil∣ling thus to have got rid of an affair, which was to reflect so much dishonour on him∣self.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="77"/>
This hope was now vanished, and he directed Madame to prepare for the re∣ception of the Marquis. Adeline passed these days in a state of suspense, which was now cheered by hope, and now darken∣ed by despair. This delay so much ex∣ceeding her expectation, seemed to prove that the illness of the Marquis was danger∣rous; and when she looked forward to the consequences of his recovery, she could not be sorry that it was so. So odious was the idea of him to her mind, that she would not suffer her lips to pronounce his name, nor make the inquiry of Annette, which was of such consequence to her peace.</P>
<P>It was about a week after the receipt of the Marquis's letter, that Adeline one day saw from her window a party of horsemen enter the avenue, and knew them to be the Marquis and his attendants. She re∣tired from the window in a state of mind not to be described, and, sinking into a chair, was for some time scarcely conscious of the objects around her. When she had recovered from the first terror, which his appearance excited, she again tottered to the window; the party was not in sight, but she heard the trampling of horses, and knew that the Marquis had wound round to the great gate of the abbey. She ad∣dressed herself to Heaven for support and
<PB N="79" REF="78"/>
protection, and her mind being now some∣what composed, sat down to wait the event.</P>
<P>La Motte received the Marquis with ex∣pressions of surprize at his long absence, and the latter, merely saying he had been de∣tained by illness, proceeded to enquire for Adeline. He was told she was in her cham∣ber, from whence she might be summoned if he wished to see her. The Marquis he∣sitated, and at length excused himself, but desired she might be strictly watched. <Q REND="inline">"Per∣haps, my Lord,"</Q> said La Motte sm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ling, <Q REND="inline">"Adeline's obstinacy has been too powerful for your passion; you seem less interested concerning her than formerly."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Oh! by no means,"</Q> replied the Mar∣quis; <Q REND="inline">"she interests me if possible more than ever; so much, indeed, that I cannot have her too closely guarded; and I, therefore, beg La Motte, that you will suffer nobody to attend her, but when you can observe them yourself. Is the room where she is confined sufficiently secure?"</Q> La Motte assured him it was; but at the same time expressed his wish that she was removed to the villa. <Q REND="inline">"If by any means,"</Q> said he, <Q REND="inline">"she should contrive to escape, I know what I must expect from your displeasure; and this reflection keeps my mind in continual anxiety."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"This removal cannot be at present,"</Q>
<PB N="80" REF="79"/>
said the Marquis; <Q REND="inline">"she is safer here, and you do wrong to disturb yourself with any apprehension of her escape, if her chamber is really so secure, as you re∣present it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I can have no motive for deceiving you, my Lord, in this point."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I do n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t suspect you of any,"</Q> said the Marquis; <Q REND="inline">"guard her carefully and trust me, she will not escape. I can rely upon my valet, and if you wish it, he shall re∣main here."</Q> La Motte thought there could be no occasion for him, and it was agreed that the man should go home.</P>
<P>The Marquis after remaining about half an hour in conversation with La Motte, left the abbey, and Adeline saw him depart with a mixture of surprize and thankfulness that almost overcame her. She had waited in mo∣mentary expectation of being summoned to appear, and had been endeavouring to arm herself with resolution to support his presence. She had listened to every voice that sounded from below, and at every step that crossed the passage, her heart had palpitated with dread, left it should be La Motte coming to lead her to the Marquis. This state of suffering had been prolonged almost beyond her power of enduring it, when she heard voices under her window, and rising, saw the Marquis ride away. After giving
<PB N="81" REF="80"/>
way to the joy and thankfulness that swelled her heart, she endeavoured to account for this circumstance, which, considering what had passed, was certainly very strange. It appeared, indeed, wholly inexplicable, and, after much fruitless inquiry, she quitted the subject, endeavouring to persuade herself that it could only portend good.</P>
<P>The time of La Motte's usual visitation now drew near, and Adeline expected it in the trembling hope of hearing that the Marquis had ceased his persecution; but he was, as usual, sullen and silent, and it was not till he was about to quit the room, that Adeline had the courage to inquire, when the Mar∣quis was expected again? La Motte, opening the door to depart, replied, <Q REND="inline">"On the following day,"</Q> and Adeline, whom fear and delicacy embarrassed, saw she could obtain no intelligence of Theodore but by a direct question; she looked earnestly as if she would have spoke, and he stopped, but she blushed and was still silent, till upon his again attempting to leave the room, she faintly called him back.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I would ask,"</Q> said she, <Q REND="inline">"after that un∣fortunate chevalier who has incurred the resentment of the Marquis by endea∣vouring to serve me. Has the Marquis mentioned him?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"He has,"</Q> replied La Motte; <Q REND="inline">"and
<PB N="82" REF="81"/>
your indifference towards the Marquis is now fully explained."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Since I must feel resentment towards those who injure me,"</Q> said Adeline, <Q REND="inline">"I may surely be allowed to be grateful to∣wards those who serve me. Had the Marquis deserved my esteem, he would, probably, have possessed it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well, well,"</Q> said La Motte, <Q REND="inline">"this young hero, who, it seems, has been brave enough to lift his arm against his Co∣lonel, is taken care of, and, I doubt not, will soon be sensible of the value of his quix∣otism."</Q> Indignation, grief, and fear, struggled in the bosom of Adeline; she dis∣dained to give La Motte an opportunity of again pronouncing the name of Theodore; yet the uncertainty under which she laboured, urged her to inquire, whether the Marquis had heard of him since he left Caux? <Q REND="inline">"Yes,"</Q> said La Motte, <Q REND="inline">"he has been safely carried to his regimen, where he is con∣fined till the Marquis can attend to appear against him."</Q></P>
<P>Adeline had neither power nor inclination to inquire farther, and La Motte quitting the chamber, she was left to the misery he had renewed. Though this information contained no new circumstance of misfor∣tune, (for she now heard confirmed what she had always expected) a weight of new
<PB N="83" REF="82"/>
sorrow seemed to fall upon her heart, and she perceived that she had unconsciously cherished a latent hope of Theodore's es∣cape before he reached the place of his desti∣nation. All hope was now, however, gone; he was suffering the miseries of a prison, and the tortures of apprehension both for his own life and her safety. She pictured to herself the dark damp dungeon where he lay, loaded with chains, and pale with sick∣ness and grief; she heard him, in a voice that thrilled her heart, call upon her name, and raise his eyes to Heaven in silent suppli∣cation: she saw the anguish of his counte∣nance, the tears that fell slowly on his cheek, and remembering, at the same time, the generous conduct that had brought him to this abyss of misery, and that it was for her sake he suffered, gries resolved itself into despair, her tears ceased to slow, and she sunk silently into a state of dreadful torpor.</P>
<P>On the morrow the Marquis arrived, and departed as before. Several days then elapsed, and he did not appear, till one evening, as La Motte and his wife were in their usual sitting-room, he entered, and conversed for sometime upon general subjects, from which, however, he by degrees fell into a reverie, and, after a pause of silence, he rose and drew La Motte to the window. <Q REND="inline">"I would speak with you alone,"</Q> said he,
<PB N="84" REF="83"/>
<Q REND="inline">"if you are at leisure; if not, another time will do."</Q> La Motte, assuring him he was perfectly so, would have conducted him to another room, but the Marquis pro∣posed a walk in the forest. They went out together, and when they had reached a so∣litary glade, where the spreading branches of the beech and oak deepened the shades of twilight, and threw a solemn obscurity around, the Marquis turned to La Motte, and addressed him:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Your condition, La Motte, is un∣happy; this abbey is a melancholy residence for a man like you fond of society, and like you also qualified to adorn it."</Q> La Motte bowed <Q REND="inline">"I wish it was in my power to restore you to the world,"</Q> continued the Marquis; <Q REND="inline">"perhaps, if I knew the particulars of the affair which has driven you from it, I might perceive that my interest could ef∣fectually serve you. I think I have heard you hint it was an affair of honour."</Q> La Motte was silent. <Q REND="inline">"I mean not to distress you, however; nor is it common curio∣sity that prompts this inquiry, but a sin∣cere desire to befriend you. You have already informed me of some particulars of your misfortunes. I think the liberality of your temper led you into expences which you afterwards endeavoured to retrieve by gaming."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="84"/>
<Q REND="inline">"Yes, my Lord,"</Q> said La Motte, <Q REND="inline">"'tis true that I dissipated the greater part of an affluent fortune in luxurious indulgen∣ces, and that I afterwards took unworthy means to recover it: but I wish to be spared upon this subject. I would, if pos∣sible, lose the remembrance of a transac∣tion which must for ever stain my charac∣ter, and the rigorous effect of which, I fear, it is not in your power, my Lord, to soften"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You may be mistaken on this point,"</Q> replied the Marquis; <Q REND="inline">"my interest at Court is by no means inconsiderable. Fear not from me any severity of censure; I am not at all inclined to judge harshly of the faults of others. I well know how to allow for the emergency of circumstances; and, I think, La Motte, you have hi∣therto found me your friend."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I have, my Lord."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And when you recollect, that I have forgiven a certain transaction of late date—"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"It is true, my Lord; and allow me to say, I have a just sense of your generosity. The transaction you allude to is by far the worst of my life; and what I have to relate cannot, therefore, lower me in your opinion. When I had dissipated the greatest part of my property in habits of
<PB N="86" REF="85"/>
voluptuous pleasure, I had recourse to gaming to supply the means of continuing them. A run of good luck, for some time, enabled me to do this, and encourag∣ing my most sanguine expectations, I conti∣nued in the same career of success.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Soon after this a sudden turn of fortune destroyed my hopes, and reduced me to the most desperate extremity. In one night my money was lowered to the sum of two hundred louis. These I resolv∣ed to stake also, and with them my life; for it was my resolution not to survive their loss. Never shall I forget the hor∣rors of that moment on which hung my fate, nor the deadly anguish that seized my heart when my last stake was gone. I stood for some time in a state of stupe∣faction, till roused to a sense of my mis∣fortune, my passion made me pour forth execrations on my more fortunate rivals, and act all the frenzy of despair. Dur∣ing this paroxysm of madness, a gentle∣man, who had been a silent observer of all that passed, approached me.—You are unfortunate, Sir, said he.—I need not be informed of that, Sir, I replied.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You have, perhaps, been ill used, re∣sumed he.—Yes, Sir, I am ruined, and, therefore, it may be said, I am ill used.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="86"/>
<Q REND="inline">"Do you know the people you have played with?</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No; but I have met them in the first circles.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Then I am, probably, mistaken, said he, and walked away. His last words roused me, and raised a hope that my mo∣ney had not been fairly lost. Wishing for farther information, I went in search of the gentleman, but he had left the rooms; I, however, stifled my transports, return∣ed to the table where I had lost my money, placed myself behind the chair of one of the persons who had won it, and closely watched the game. For some time I saw nothing that could confirm my suspicions, but was at length convinced they were just.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"When the game was ended I called one of my adversaries out of the room, and telling him what I had observed, threatened instantly to expose him if he did not restore my property. The man was, for some time, as positive as myself; and, assuming the bully, threatened me with chastisement for my scandalous assertions. I was not, however, in a state of mind to be frightened, and his manner served only to exasperate my temper, already sufficiently inflamed by missortune. After retorting his threats, I was about to re∣turn
<PB N="88" REF="87"/>
to the apartment we had left, and expose what had passed, when, with an insidious smile and a softened voice, he begged I would favour him with a few moments attention, and allow him to speak with the gentleman his partner. To the latter part of his request I hesitated, but, in the mean time, the gentleman himself entered the room. His partner related to him, in few words, what had passed between us, and the terror that appeared in his countenance sufficiently declared his consciousness of guilt.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"They then drew aside, and remained a few minutes in conversation together, after which they approached me with an offer, as they phrased it, of a compromise. I declared, however, against any thing of this kind, and swore, nothing less than the whole sum I had lost should content me.—Is it not possible, Monsieur, that you may be offered something as advan∣tageous as the whole?—I did not under∣stand their meaning, but, after they had continued for some time to give distant hints of the same sort, they proceeded to explain.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Perceiving their characters wholly in my power, they wished to secure my interest to their party, and, therefore, informing me, that they belonged to an association
<PB N="89" REF="88"/>
of persons, who lived upon the folly and inexperience of others, they offered me a share in their concern. My fortunes were desperate, and the proposal now made me would not only produce an immediate sup∣ply, but enable me to return to those scenes of dissipated pleasure, to which passion had at first, and long habit after∣wards, attached me. I closed with the offer, and thus sunk from dissipation into infamy."</Q></P>
<P>La Motte paused, as if the recollection of these times filled him with remorse. The Marquis understood his feelings. <Q REND="inline">"You judge too rigorously of yourself,"</Q> said he; <Q REND="inline">"there are few persons, let their appear∣ance of honesty be what it may, who, in such circumstances, would have acted better than you have done. Had I been in your situation, I know not how I might have acted. That rigid virtue which shall condemn you, may dignify itself with the appel ation of wisdom, but I wish not to possess it; let it still reside, where it generally is to be found, in the cold bosoms of those, who, wanting feel∣ing to be men, dignify themselves with the title of philosophers. But pray pro∣ceed."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Our success was for some time unli∣mited, for we held the wheel of fortune,
<PB N="90" REF="89"/>
and trusted not to her caprice. Thought∣less and voluptuous by nature, my ex∣pences fully kept pace with my income. An unlucky discovery of the practices of our party was at length made by a young no∣bleman, which obliged us to act for some time with the utmost circumspection. It would be tedious to relate the particu∣lars, which made us at length so suspected, that the distant civility and cold reserve of our acquaintance rendered the frequenting public assemblies both painful and unprofi∣table. We turned our thoughts to other modes o obtaining money, and a swindling transaction, in which I engaged, to a very large amount, soon compelled me to leave Paris. You know the rest, my Lord."</Q></P>
<P>La Motte was now silent, and the Marquis continued for some time musing. <Q REND="inline">"You p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rceive, my Lord,"</Q> at length resumed La Motte, <Q REND="inline">"you perceive that my case is hopeless."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"It is bad, indeed, but not entirely hope∣less. From my soul I p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>y you. Yet, if you should return to the world, and in∣cur the danger of prosecution, I think my interest with the Minister might save you from any severe punishment. You seem, however, to have lost your relish
<PB N="91" REF="90"/>
for society, and, perhaps, do not wish to return to it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Oh! my Lord, can you doubt this?—But I am overcome with the excess of your goodness; would to Heaven it were in my power to prove the gratitude it inspires."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Talk not of goodness,"</Q> said the Marquis; <Q REND="inline">"I will not pretend that my desire of serving you is unalloyed by any degree of self∣interest. I will not affect to be more than man, and trust me those who do are less. It is in your power to testify your gratitude, and bind me to your interest for ever."</Q> He paused. <Q REND="inline">"Name but the means,"</Q> cried La Motte, <Q REND="inline">"name but the means, and if they are within the compass of possibility they shall be execu∣ted."</Q> The Marquis was still silent. <Q REND="inline">"Do you doubt my sincerity, my Lord, that you are yet silent? Do you fear to repose a confidence in the man whom you have already loaded with obligation? who lives by your mercy, and almost by your means."</Q> The Marquis looked earnestly at him, but did not speak. <Q REND="inline">"I have not deserved this of you, my Lord; speak, I entreat you."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"There are certain prejudices attached to the human mind,"</Q> said the Marquis in a slow and solemn voice, <Q REND="inline">"which it re∣quires
<PB N="92" REF="91"/>
all our wisdom to keep from interfer∣ing with our happiness; certain set notions, acquired in infancy, and cherished invo∣luntarily by age, which grow up and assume a gloss so plausible, that few minds, in what is called a civilized country, can afterwards overcome them. Truth is often perverted by education. While the refined Europeans boast a standard of honour, and a sublimity of virtue, which often leads them from pleasure to misery, and from nature to error, the simple, uninformed An erican follows the impulse of his heart, and obeys the inspiration of wisdom."</Q> The Marquis paused, and La Motte continued to listen in eager expectation.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Nature, uncontaminated by false re∣finement,"</Q> resumed the Marquis, <Q REND="inline">"every where acts alike in the great occurrences of life. The Indian discovers his friend to be perfidious, and he kills him; the wild Asiatic does the same; the Turk, when ambition fires, or revenge provokes, gratifies his passion at the expence of life, and does not call it murder. Even the polished Italian, distracted by jealousy, or tempted by a strong circumstance of advantage, draws his stilletto, and ac∣complishes his purpose. It is the first
<PB N="93" REF="92"/>
proof of a superior mind to libe ate itself from prejudices of country, or of education. You are silent, La Motte; are you not of my opinion?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am attending, my Lord, to your <HI>reasoning.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"There are, I repeat it,"</Q> said the Marquis, <Q REND="inline">"people of minds so weak, as to shrink from acts they have been accustomed to hold wrong, however advantageous. They never suffer them∣selves to be guided by circumstances, but fix for life upon a certain standard, from which they will, on no account, depart. Self preservation is the great law of nature; when a reptile hurts us, or an animal of prey threatens us, we think no farther, but endeavour to annihilate it. When my life, or what may be essential to my life, requires the sacrifice of another, or even if some passion, wholly unconquera∣ble, requires it, I should be a mad∣man to hesitaate. La Motte, I think I may confide in you—there are ways of doing certain things—you under∣stand me There are times, and cir∣cumstances, and opportuni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ies—you com∣prehend my meaning."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Explain yourself, my Lord."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="93"/>
<Q REND="inline">"Kind services that—in short there are services, which excite all our gratitude, and which we can never think repaid. It is in your power to place me in such a situation."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Indeed! my Lord, name the means."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I have already named them. This abbey well suits the purpose; it is shut up from the eye of observation; any transaction may be concealed within its walls; the hour of midnight may witness the deed, and the morn shall not dawn to disclose it; these woods tell no tales. Ah! La Motte, am I right in trusting this business with you; may I believe you are desirous of serving me, and of preserving yourself?"</Q> The Marquis paused, and looked stedfastly at La Motte, whose countenance was almost concealed by the gloom of evening.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"My Lord, you may trust me in any thing; explain yourself more fully."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What security will you give me for your faithfulness?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"My life, my Lord; is it not already in your power?"</Q> The Marquis hesitated, and then said, <Q REND="inline">"To-morrow, about this time, I shall return to the abbey, and will then explain my meaning, if, indeed, you shall not already have understood it. You, in the mean time, will consider
<PB N="95" REF="94"/>
your own powers of resolution, and be prepared either to adopt the purpose I shall suggest, or to declare you will not."</Q> La Motte made some confused reply. <Q REND="inline">"Fare∣wel till to-morrow,"</Q> said the Marquis; <Q REND="inline">"remember that freedom and affluence are now before you."</Q> He moved towards the abbey, and, mounting his horse, rode off with his attendants. La Motte walked slowly, home, musing on the late conversa∣tion.</P>

<P>THE Marquis was punctual to the hour. La Morte received him at the gate, but he declined entering, and said he prefer∣red a walk in the forest. Thither, there∣fore, La Motte attended him. After some general conversation, <Q REND="inline">"Well,"</Q> said the
<PB N="96" REF="95"/>
Marquis, <Q REND="inline">"have you considered what I said, and are you prepared to decide?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I have, my Lord, and will quickly decide, when you shall farther explain yourself. Till then I can form no reso∣lution."</Q> The Marquis appeared dissatis∣fied, and was a moment silent. <Q REND="inline">"Is it then possible,"</Q> he at length resumed, <Q REND="inline">"that you do not understand? This igno∣rance is surely affected. La Motte, I expect sincerity Tell me, herefore, is it necessary I should say more?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"It is, my Lord,"</Q> said La Motte immediately. <Q REND="inline">"Is you fear to confide in me freely, how can I fully accomplish your purpose?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Before I proceed farther,"</Q> said the Marquis, <Q REND="inline">"let me administer some oath which shall bind you to secrecy. But this is scarcely necessary; for, could I even doubt your word of honour, the remembrance of a certain transaction would point out to you the necessity of being as silent yourself as you must wish me to be."</Q> There was now a pause of silence, during which both the Marquis and La Motte betrayed some con∣fusion. <Q REND="inline">"I think, La Motte,"</Q> said he, <Q REND="inline">"I have given you sufficient proof that I can be grateful: the services you have already rendered me with respect to Adeline have not been unrewarded."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="96"/>
<Q REND="inline">"True, my Lord, I am ever willing to acknowledge this, and am sorry it has not been in my power to serve you more effectually. Your farther views respecting her I am ready to assist."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I thank you—Adeline"—</Q>the Marquis hesitated—<Q REND="inline">"Adeline,"</Q> rejoined La Motte, eager to anticipate his wishes, <Q REND="inline">"has beauty worthy of your pursuit. She has inspired a passion of which she ought to be proud, and, at any rate, she shall soon be yours. Her charms are worthy of"—</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yes yes,"</Q> interrupted the Marquis; <Q REND="inline">"but"—</Q>he paused.—<Q REND="inline">"But they have given you too much trouble in the pursuit,"</Q> said La Motte; <Q REND="inline">"and to be sure, my Lord, it must be confessed they have; but this trouble is all over—you may now consider her as your own."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I would do so,"</Q> said the Marquis, fixing an eye of earnest regard upon La Motte—<Q REND="inline">"I would do so."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Name your hour, my Lord; you shall not be interrupted.—Beauty such as Adeline's"—</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Watch her closely,"</Q> interrupted the Marquis, <Q REND="inline">"and on no account suffer her to leave her apartment. Where is she now?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Confined in her chamber."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="97"/>
<Q REND="inline">"Very well. But I am impatient."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Name your time, my Lord—to-morrow night."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"<HI>To-morrow</HI> night,"</Q> said the Marquis—<Q REND="inline">"to-morrow night. Do you understand me now?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yes, my Lord, this night, if you wish it so. But had you not better dismiss your servants, and remain yourself in the forest. You know the door that opens upon the woods from the west tower. Come thither about twelve—I will be there to conduct you to her chamber. Remem∣ber, then, my Lord, that to right"—</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Adeline dies!"</Q> interrupted the Mar∣quis, in a low voice scarcely human. <Q REND="inline">"Do you understand me now?"—</Q>La Motte shrunk aghast—<Q REND="inline">"My Lord!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"La Motte!"</Q> said the Marquis.—There was silence of several minutes, in which La Motte endeavoured to recover himself.—<Q REND="inline">"Let me ask, my Lord, the meaning of this?"</Q> said he, when he had breath to speak. <Q REND="inline">"Why should you wish the death of Adeline—of Adeline whom so lately you loved?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Make no inquiries for my motive,"</Q> said the Marquis; <Q REND="inline">"but it is as certain as that I live that she you name must die. This is sufficient."</Q> The surprise of La Motte equalled his horror. <Q REND="inline">"The
<PB N="99" REF="98"/>
means are various,"</Q> resumed the Marquis. <Q REND="inline">"I could have wished that no blood might be spilt; and there are drugs sure and speedy in their effect, but they cannot be soon or safely procured. I also wish it over—it must be done quickly—this night."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"This night, my Lord!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Aye, this night, La Motte; if it is to be, why not soon. Have you no con∣venient drug at hand?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"None, my Lord."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I feared to trust a third person, or I should have been provided,"</Q> said the Marquis. <Q REND="inline">"As it is, take this poignard; use it as occasion offers, but be resolute"</Q> La Motte received the poignard with a trembling hand, and continued to gaze upon it for some time, scarcely knowing what he did. <Q REND="inline">"Put it up,"</Q> said the Marquis, <Q REND="inline">"and endeavour to recollect yourself."</Q> La Motte obeyed, but continued to muse in silence.</P>
<P>He saw himself entangled in the web which his own crimes had woven. Being in the power of the Marquis, he knew he must either consent to the commission of a deed, from the enormity of which, depraved as he was, he shrunk in horror, or sacrifice fortune, freedom, probably life itself, to the refusal. Had had been led on by
<PB N="100" REF="99"/>
gradations from folly to vice, till he now saw before him an abyss of guilt which startled even the conscience that so long had slumber∣ed. The means of retreating were desperate—to proceed was equally so.</P>
<P>When he considered the innocence and the helplessness of Adeline, her orphan state, her former affectionate conduct, and her confidence in his protection, his heart melted with compassion for the distress he had al∣ready occasioned her, and shrunk in terror from the deed he was urged to commit. But when, on the other hand, he contempla∣ted the destruction that threatened him from the vengeance of the Marquis, and then con∣sidered the advantages that were offered him of favour, freedom, and probably fortune, terror and temptation contributed to over∣come the pleadings of humanity, and silence the voice of conscience. In this state of tu∣multuous uncertainty he continued for some time silent, until the voice of the Marquis roused him to a conviction of the necessity of at least appearing to acquiesce in his designs.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Do you hesitate?"</Q> said the Marquis.—<Q REND="inline">"No, my Lord, my resolution is fixed—I will obey you. But methinks it would be better to avoid bloodshed. Strange secrets have been revealed by"—</Q></P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="100"/>
<Q REND="inline">"Aye, but how avoid it?"</Q> interrupted the Marquis.—<Q REND="inline">"Poison <HI>I</HI> will not venture to procure. I have given you one sure instrument of death. You also may find it dangerous to inquire for a drug."</Q> La Motte perceived that he could not purchase poison without incurring a discovery much greater than that he wished to avoid. <Q REND="inline">"You are right, my Lord, and I will follow your orders implicitly"</Q> The Marquis now proceeded, in broken sentences, to give far∣ther directions concerning this dreadful scheme.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"In her sleep,"</Q> said he, <Q REND="inline">"at midnight; the family will then be at rest."</Q> Afterwards they planned a story, which was to account for her disappearance, and by which it was to seem that she had sought an escape in con∣sequence of her aversion to the addresses of the Marquis. The doors of her chamber and of the west tower were to be left open to corroborate this account, and many other circumstances were to be contrived to con∣firm the suspicion. They farther consulted how the Marquis was to be informed of the event; and it was agreed that he should come as usual to the Abbey on the following day. <Q REND="inline">"<HI>To-night, then,</HI>"</Q> said the Marquis, <Q REND="inline">"I may rely upon your resolution."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You may, my Lord."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="101"/>
<Q REND="inline">"Farewell, then, When we meet a∣gain"—</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"When we meet again,"</Q> said La Motte, <Q REND="inline">"it will be done."</Q> He followed the Marquis to the Abbey, and having seen him mount his horse and wished him a good night, he retired to his chamber, where he shut him∣self up.</P>
<P>Adeline, mean while, in the solitude of her prison, gave way to the despair which her condition inspired. She tried to arrange her thoughts, and to argue herself into some degree of resignation; but reflection, by representing the past, and reason, by anti∣cipating the future, brought before her mind the full picture of her misfortunes, and she sunk in despondency. Of Theodore, who, by a conduct so noble, had testified his at∣tachment and involved himself in ruin, she thought with a degree of anguish infinitely superior to any she had felt upon any other occasion.</P>
<P>That the very exertions which had de∣served all her gratitude, and awakened all her tenderness, should be the cause of his destruction, was a circumstance so much beyond the ordinary bounds of misery, that her fortitude sunk at once before it. The idea of Theodore suffering—Theodore dying—was for ever present to her imagination, and frequently excluding the sense of her
<PB N="103" REF="102"/>
own danger, made her conscious only of his. Sometimes the hope he had given her of be∣ing able to vindicate his conduct, or at least to obtain a pardon, would return; but it was like the faint beam of an April morn, transient and cheerless. She knew that the Marquis, stung with jealousy, and exas∣perated to revenge, would pursue him with unrelenting malice.</P>
<P>Against such an enemy what could Theo∣dore oppose? Conscious rectitude would not avail him to ward off the blow which dis∣appointed passion and powerful pride directed. Her distress was considerably heightened by reflecting that no intelligence of him could reach her at the Abbey, and that she must remain she knew not how long in the most dreadful suspence concerning his fate. From the Abbey she saw no possibility of escaping. She was a prisoner in a chamber inclosed at every avenue: she had no opportunity of conversing with any person who could afford her even a chance of relief; and she saw herself condemned to await in passive silence the impending destiny, infinitely more dreadful to her immagination than death itself.</P>
<P>Thus circumstanced, she yielded to the pressure of her misfortunes, and would sit for hours motionless and given up to thought. <Q REND="inline">"Theodore!"</Q> she would frequently exclaim,
<PB N="104" REF="103"/>
<Q REND="inline">"you cannot hear my voice, you cannot fly to help me; yourself a prisoner and in chains."</Q> The picture was too horrid. The swelling anguish of her heart would subdue her utterance—tears bathed her checks—and she became insensible to every thing but the misery of Theodore.</P>
<P>On this evening her mind had been remarkably tranquil; and as she watched from her window, with a still and melan∣choly pleasure, the setting sun, the fading splendour of the western horizon, and the gardual approach of twilight, her thoughts bore her back to the time when, in happier circumstances, she had watched the same appearances. She recollected also the evening of her temporary escape from the Abbey, when from this same window she had viewed the declining sun—how anxiously she had awaited the fall of twilight—how much she had endeavoured to anticipate the events of her future life—with what trembling fear she had descended from the tower and ven∣tured into the forest. These reflections pro∣duced others that filled her heart with anguish and her eyes with tears.</P>
<P>While she was lost in her melancholy reverie she saw the Marquis mount his horse and depart from the gates. The sight of him revived, in all its force, a sense of the mi∣sery he inflicted on her beloved Theodore,
<PB N="105" REF="104"/>
and a consciousness of the evils which more immediately threatened herself. She with∣drew from the window in an agony of tears, which continuing for a considerable time, her frame was at length, quite exhausted, and she retired early to rest.</P>
<P>La Motte remained in his chamber till supper obliged him to descend. At table his wild and haggard countenance, which, in spite of all his endeavours, betrayed the disorder of his mind, and his long and fre∣quent fits of abstraction surprised as well as alarmed Madame La Motte. When Peter left the room she tenderly inquired what had disturbed him, and he with a distorted smile tried to be gay, but the effort was be∣yond his art, and he quickly relapsed into silence; or when Madame La Motte spoke, and he strove to conceal the absence of his thoughts, he answered so intirely from the purpose, that his abstraction became still more apparent. Observing this, Madame La Motte appeared to take no notice of his present temper; and they continued to sit in uninterrupted silence till the hour of rest, when they retired to their chamber.</P>
<P>La Motte lay in a state of disturbed watch∣fulness for some time, and his frequent starts awoke Madame, who, however, being pacified by some trifling excuse, soon went to sleep again. This agitation continued
<PB N="106" REF="105"/>
till near midnight, when, recollecting that the time was now passing in idle reflection which ought to be devoted to action, he stole silently from his bed, wrapped him∣self in his night gown, and, taking the lamp which burned nightly in his cham∣ber, passed up the spiral staircase. As he went he frequently looked back, and often started and listened to the hollow sighings of the blast.</P>
<P>His hand shook so violently, when he at∣tempted to unlock the door of Adeline's chamber, that he was obliged to set the lamp on the ground, and apply both his hands. The noise he made with the key induced him to suppose he must have awakened her; but when he opened the door, and perceived the stillness that reigned within, he was convinced she was asleep. When he approached the bed he heard her gently breathe, and soon after sigh—and he stopped; but silence returning, he again ad∣vanced, and then heard her sing in her sleep. As he listened he distinguished some notes of a melancholy little air which, in her happier days, she had often sung to him. The low and mournful accent in which she now uttered them expressed too well the tone of her mind.</P>
<P>La Motte now stepped hastily towards the bed, when, breathing a deep sigh, she was
<PB N="107" REF="106"/>
again silent. He undrew the curtain, and saw her lying in a profound sleep, her cheek yet wet with tears, resting upon her arm. He stood a moment looking at her; and as he viewed her innocent and lovely countenance, pale in grief, the light of the lamp, which shone strong upon her eyes, awoke her, and, perceiving a man, she uttered a scream. Her recol∣lection returning, she knew him to be La Motte, and it instantly recurring to her that the Marquis was at hand, she raised herself in bed, and implored pity and pro∣tection. La Motte stood looking eagerly at her, but without replying.</P>
<P>The wildness of his looks and the gloomy silence he preserved increased her alarm, and with tears of terror she renewed her supplication. <Q REND="inline">"You once saved me from destruction,"</Q> cried she; <Q REND="inline">"O save me now! Have pity upon me—I have no protector but you."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What is it you fear?"</Q> said La Motte in a tone scarcely articulate.—<Q REND="inline">"O save me—save me from the Marquis!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Rise then,"</Q> said he, <Q REND="inline">"and dress yourself quickly—I shall be back again in a few minutes."</Q> He lighted a candle that stood on the table, and left the cham∣ber. Adeline immediately arose and en∣deavoured to dress, but her thoughts were
<PB N="108" REF="107"/>
so bewildered that she scarcely knew what she did, and her whole frame so violently agitated that it was with the utmost dif∣ficulty she preserved herself from faint∣ing. She threw her clothes hastily on, and then sat down to await the return of La Motte. A considerable time elapsed, yet he did not appear, and, having in vain endeavoured to compose her spirits, the pain of suspence at length became so insup∣portable, that she opened the door of her chamber, and went to the top of the stair∣case to listen. She thought she heard voi∣ces below; but, considering that if the Marquis was there her appearance could only increase her danger, she checked the step she had almost involuntarily taken to descend. Still she listened, and still thought she distinguished voices. Soon after she heard a door shut, and then footsteps, and she hastened back to her chamber.</P>
<P>Near a quarter of an hour elapsed and La Motte did not appear. When again she thought she heard a murmur of voices below, and also passing steps, and at length her anxiety not suffering her to remain in her room, she mooved through the passage that com∣municated with the spiral staircase; but all was now still. In a few moments, however, a light flashed across the hall, and La Motte appeared at the door of the vaulted room.
<PB N="109" REF="108"/>
He looked up, and seeing Adeline in the gallery, beckoned her to descend.</P>
<P>She hesitated and looked towards her chamber; but La Motte now approached the stairs, and, with faultering steps, she went to meet him. <Q REND="inline">"I fear the Marquis may see me,"</Q> said she, whispering; <Q REND="inline">"where is he?"</Q> La Motte took her hand, and led her on, assuring her she had no∣thing to fear from the Marquis. The wild∣ness of his looks, however, and the tremb∣ling of his hand, seemed to contradict this assurance, and she inquired whither he was leading her. <Q REND="inline">"To the forest,"</Q> said La Motte, <Q REND="inline">"that you may escape from the Abbey—a horse waits for you without. I can save you by no other means."</Q> New terror seized her. She could scarcely believe that La Motte, who had hitherto con∣spired with the Marquis, and had so closely confined her, should now himself undertake her escape, and she at this moment felt a dreadful presentiment, which it was im∣possible to account for, that he was lead∣ding her out to murder her in the forest. Again shrinking back, she supplicated his mercy. He assured her he meant only to protect her, and desired she would not waste time.</P>
<P>There was something in his manner that spoke sincerity, and she suffered him
<PB N="110" REF="109"/>
to conduct her to a side door that opened into the forest, where she could just dis∣tinguish through the gloom a man on horse∣back. This brought to her remembrance the night in which she had quutted the tomb, when trusting to the person who appeared she had been carried to the Marquis's villa, La Motte called, and was answered by Peter, whose voice somewhat re-assured Ade∣line.</P>
<P>He then told her that the Marquis would return to the Abbey on the following morn∣ing, and that this could be her only oppor∣tunity of escaping his designs; that she might rely upon his (La Motte's) word, that Peter had orders to carry her wherever she chose; but as he knew the Marquis would be indefa∣tigable in search of her, he advised her by all means to leave the kingdom, which she might do with Peter, who was a native of Savoy, and would convey her to the house of his sister. There she might remain till La Motte himself, who did not now think it would be safe to continue much longer in France, should join her. He intreat∣ed her whatever might happen, never to mention the events which had passed at the Abbey. <Q REND="inline">"To save you, Adeline, I have risked my life; do not encrease my danger and your own by any un∣necessary discoveries. We may never meet
<PB N="111" REF="110"/>
again, but I hope you will be happy; and remember, when you think of me, that I am not quite so bad as I have been tempted to be."</Q></P>
<P>Having said this, he gave her some money, which he told her would be necessary to de∣fray the expences of her journey. Adeline could no longer doubt his sincerity, and her transports of joy and gratitude would scarcely permit her to thank him. She wished to have bid Madame La Motte farewell, and indeed earnestly requested it; but he again told her she had no time to lose, and, having wrapped her in a large cloak, he lifted her upon the horse. She bade him adieu with tears of gratitude, and Peter set off as fast as the darkness would permit.</P>
<P>When they were got some way, <Q REND="inline">"I am glad with all my heart, Ma'amselle,"</Q> said he, <Q REND="inline">"to see you again. Who would have thought, after all, that my master him∣self would have bid me take you away!—Well, to be sure, strange things come to pass; but I hope we shall have better luck this time."</Q> Adeline, not chusing to re∣proach him with the treachery of which she feared he had been formerly guilty, thanked him for his good wishes, and said she hoped they should be more fortunate; but Peter, in his usual strain of eloquence, proceeded to undeceive her in this point, and to acquaint
<PB N="112" REF="111"/>
her with every circumstance which his me∣mory, and it was naturally a strong one, could furnish:</P>
<P>Peter expressed such an artless interest in her welfare, and such a concern for her disappointment, that she could no longer doubt his faithfulness; and this conviction not only strengthened her confidence in the present undertaking, but made her listen to his conversation with kindness and pleasure. <Q REND="inline">"I should never have staid at the Abbey till this time,"</Q> said he, <Q REND="inline">"if I could have got away; but my master frighted me so about the Marquis, and I had not money enough to carry me into my own country, so that I was forced to stay. It's well we have got some solid louis-d'ors now; for I question, Ma'am<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elle, whether the peo∣ple on the road would have taken those trinkets you formerly talked of for money."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Possibly not,"</Q> said Adeline; <Q REND="inline">"I am thankful to Monsieur La Motte that we have more certain means of procuring con∣veniences. What route shall you take when we leave the forest, Peter?"—</Q>Peter mentioned very correctly a great part of the road to Lyons: <Q REND="inline">"and then,"</Q> said he, <Q REND="inline">"we can easily get to Savoy, and that will be nothing. My sister, God bless her! I hope is living; I have not seen her many year; but if she is not, all the people
<PB N="113" REF="112"/>
will be glad to see me, and you will easily get a lodging, Ma'amselle, and every thing you want."</Q></P>
<P>Adeline resolved to go with him to Savoy. La Motte, who knew the character and de∣signs of the Marquis, had advised her to leave the kingdom, and had told her, what her fears would have suggested, that the Mar∣quis would be indefatigable in search of her. His motive for this advice must be a desire of serving her; why else, when she was already in his power, should he remove her to ano∣ther place, and even furnish her with money for the expences of a journey?</P>
<P>At Leloncourt, where Peter said he was well known, she would be most likely to meet with protection and comfort, even should his sister be dead; and its distance and solitary situation were circumstances that pleased her. These reflections would have pointed out to her the prudence of pro∣ceeding to Savoy, had she been less destitute of resources in France; in her present situa∣tion they proved it to be necessary.</P>
<P>She enquired farther concerning the route they were to take, and whether Peter was sufficiently acquainted with the road.—<Q REND="inline">"When once I get to Thiers, I know it well enough,"</Q> said Peter, <Q REND="inline">"for I have gone it many a time in my younger days, and any body will tell us the way there."</Q> They
<PB N="114" REF="113"/>
travelled for several hours in darkness and si∣lence, and it was not till they emerged from the forest that Adeline saw the morning light streak the eastern clouds. The sight cheered and revived her; and as she travell∣ed silently along, her mind revolved the events of the past night, and meditated plans for the future. The present kindness of La Motte appeared so very different from his former conduct, that it astonished and per∣plexed her, and she could only account for it by attributing it to one of those sudden im∣pulses of humanity which sometimes ope∣rate even upon the most depraved hearts.</P>
<P>But when she recollected his former words, <Q REND="inline">"that he was not master of himself,"</Q> she could scarcely believe that mere pity could induce him to break the bonds which had hi∣therto so strongly held him, and then, consi∣dering the altered conduct of the Marquis, she was inclined to think that she owed her liberty to some change in his sentiments to∣wards her; yet the advice La Motte had given her o quit the kingdom, and the money with which he had supplied her for that purpose, seemed to contradict this opinion, and involved her again in doubt.</P>
<P>Peter now got directions to Thiers, which place they reached without any accident, and there stopped to refresh themselves. As soon as Peter thought the horse sufficiently
<PB N="115" REF="114"/>
rested, they again set forward, and from the rich plains of the Lyonnois Adeline, for the first time, caught a view of the distant alps, whose majestic heads, seeming to prop the vault of heaven, filled her mind with sublime emotions.</P>
<P>In a few hours they reached the vale, in which stands the city of Lyons, whose beau∣tiful environs, studded with villas, and rich with cultivation, withdrew Adeline from the melancholy contemplation of her own cir∣cumstances, and her more painful anxiety for Theodore.</P>
<P>When they reached that busy city, her first care was to enquire concerning the pas∣sage of the Rhone; but she forbore to make these inquiries of the people of the inn, consi∣dering that if the Marquis should trace her thither they might enable him to pursue her route. She, therefore, sent Peter to the quays to hire a boat, while she herself took a slight repast, it being her intention to embark immediately. Peter presently returned, hav∣ing engaged a boat and men to take them up the Rhone to the nearest part of Savoy, from whence they were to proceed by land to the village of Leloncourt.</P>
<P>Having taken some refreshment, she or∣dered him to conduct her to the vessel. A new and striking seene presented itself to Ade∣line, who looked with surprise upon the river
<PB N="116" REF="115"/>
gay with vessels, and the quay crowded with busy faces, and felt the contrast which the cheerful objects around bore to herself—to her an orphan, desolate, helpless, and flying from persecution and her country. She spoke with the master of the boat, and having sent Peter back to the inn for the horse, (La Motte's gift to Peter in lieu of some arrears of wages) they embarked.</P>
<P>As they slowly passed up the Rhone, whose steep banks, crowned with mountains, ex∣hibited the most various, wild, and roman∣tic scenery, Adeline sat in pensive reverie. The novelty of the scene through which she floated, now frowning with savage grandeur, and now smiling in fertility, and gay with towns and villages, soothed her mind, and her sorrow gradually softened into a gentle and not unpleasing melancholy. She had seated herself at the head of the boat, where she watched its sides cleave the swift stream, and listened to the dashing of the waters.</P>
<P>The boat, slowly opposing the current, passed along for some hours, and at length the veil of evening was stretched over the landscape. The weather was fine, and Ade∣line, regardless of the dews that now fell, remained in the open air, observing the ob∣jects darken round her, the gay tints of the horizon fade away, and the stars gradually appear, trembling upon the lucid mirror
<PB N="117" REF="116"/>
of the waters. The scene was now sunk in deep shadow, and the silence of the hour was broken only by the measured dashing of the oars, and now and then by the voice of Peter speaking to the boatmen. Adeline sat lost in thought: the forlornness of her cir∣cumstances came heightened to her imagi∣nation.</P>
<P>She saw herself surrounded by the darkness and stillness of night, in a strange place, far distant from any friends, going she scarce∣ly knew whither, under the guidance of strangers, and pursued, perhaps, by an in∣veterate enemy. She pictured to herself the rage of the Marquis now that he had disco∣vered her flight, and though she knew it very unlikely he should follow her by water, for which reason she had chosen that manner of travelling, she trembled at the portrait her fancy drew. Her thoughts then wander∣ed to the plan she should adopt after reaching Savoy; and much as her experience had pre∣judiced her against the manners of a convent, she saw no place more likely to afford her a proper asylum. At length she retired to the little cabin for a few hours repose.</P>
<P>She awoke with the dawn, and her mind being too much disturbed to sleep again, she rose and watched the gradual ap∣proach of day. As she mused, she expres∣sed the feelings of the moment in the fol∣lowing.

<P>When Adeline left the Abbey, La Motte had remained for some time at the gate, listening to the steps of the horse that carried her, till the sound was lost in distance; he then turned into the hall with a lightness of heart to which he had long been a stranger. The satisfaction of having thus preserved her, as he hoped, from the designs of the Marquis, overcame for a while all sense of the danger in which this step must involve him. But when he returned intirely to his own situati∣on, the terrors of the Marquis's resentment struck their full force upon his mind, and he considered how he might best escape it.</P>
<P>It was now past midnight—the Marquis
<PB N="119" REF="118"/>
was expected early on the following day; and in this interval it at first appeared pro∣bable to him that he might quit the forest. There was only one horse; but he consider∣ed whether it would be best to set off im∣mediately for Auboine, where a carriage might be procured to convey his family and his moveables from the Abbey, or quietly to await the arrival of the Marquis, and endea∣vour to impose upon him by a forged story of Adeline's escape.</P>
<P>The time which must clapse before a car∣riage could reach the Abbey would leave him scarcely sufficient to escape from the forest; what money he had remaining from the Marquis's bounty would not carry him far; and when it was expended he must pro∣bably be at a loss for subsistance, should he not before then be detected. By remaining at the Abbey it would appear that he was un∣conscious of deserving the Marquis's resent∣ment, and though he could not expect to impress a belief upon him that his orders had been executed, he might make it appear that Peter only had been accessary to the escape of Adeline; an account which would seem the more probable from Peter's having been formerly detected in a similar scheme. He believed also that if the Marquis should threat∣en to deliver him into the hands of justice, he might save himself by a menace of dis∣closing
<PB N="120" REF="119"/>
the crime he had commissioned him to perpetrate.</P>
<P>Thus arguing La Motte resolved to remain at the Abbey and await the event of the Mar∣quis's disappointment.</P>
<P>When the Marquis did arrive, and was informed of Adeline's flight, the strong workings of his soul, which appeared in his countenance, for a while alarmed and terrified La Motte. He cursed himself and her in terms of such coarseness and vehe∣mence as La Motte was astonished to hear from a man whose <HI>manners</HI> were generally amiable, whatever might be the violence and criminality of his passions. To invent and express these terms seemed to give him not only relief, but delight; yet he appeared more shocked at the circumstance of her es∣cape than exasperated at the carelessness of La Motte and recollecting at length that he wasted time, he left the Abbey, and dis∣patched several of his servants in pursuit of her.</P>
<P>When he was gnoe, La Motte, believing his story had succeeded, returned to the pleasure of considering that he had done his duty, and to the hope that Adeline was now beyond the reach of pursuit. This calm was of short continuance. In a few hours the Marquis returned, accompanied by the officers of justice. The affrighted La Motte,
<PB N="121" REF="120"/>
perceiving him approach, endeavoured to conceal himself but was seized and carried to the Marquis, who drew him aside.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am not to be imposed upon,"</Q> said he, <Q REND="inline">"by such a superficial story as you have invented; you know your life is in my hands; tell me instantly where you have secreted Adeline, or I will charge you with the crime you have committed against me; but, upon your disclosing the place of her conceal∣ment, I will dismiss the officers, and, if you wish it, assist you to leave the kingdom. You have no time to hesitate, and may know that I will not be trifled with."</Q> La Motte attempted to appease the Marquis, and affirmed that Adeline was really fled he knew not whither. <Q REND="inline">"You will remember, my Lord, that your charac∣ter is also in my power; and that, if you proceed to extremities, you will compel me to reveal in the face of day that you would have made me a mur∣derer."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And who will believe you?"</Q> said the Marquis. <Q REND="inline">"The crimes that banished you from society will be no testimony of your veracity, and that with which I now charge you will bring with it a sufficient presumption that your accusation is malicious. Officers, do your duty."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="121"/>
They entered the room and seized La Motte, whom terror now deprived of all power of resistance, could resistance have availed him, and in the perturbation of his mind he informed the Marquis that Adeline had taken the road to Lyons. This discovery, however, was made too late to serve himself; the Marquis seized the advantage it offered, but the charge had been given, and, with the anguish of knowing that he had exposed Adeline to danger without benefiting himself, La Motte submitted in silence to his fate. Scarcely allowing him time to collect what little effects might easily be carried with him, the officers conveyed him from the Abbey; but the Marquis, in consideration of the extreme distress of Madame La Motte, directed one of his servants to procure a carriage from Auboine that she might follow her husband.</P>
<P>The Marquis, in the mean time, now acquainted with the route Adeline had ta∣ken, sent forward his faithful valet to trace her to her place of concealment, and re∣turn immediately with intelligence to the villa.</P>
<P>Abandoned to despair, La Motte and his wife quitted the forest of Fontangville, which had for so many months afforded them an asylum, and embarked once more upon
<PB N="123" REF="122"/>
the tumultuous world, where justice would meet La Motte in the form of destruction. They had entered the forest as a refuge, ren∣dered necessary by the former crimes of La Motte, and for some time found in it the se∣curity they sought; but other offences, for even in that sequestered spot there hap∣pened to be temptation, soon succeeded, and his life, already sufficiently marked by the punishment of vice, now afforded him another instance of this great truth, <Q REND="inline">"That where guilt is, there peace cannot enter."</Q></P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>ADELINE, mean while, and Peter proceeded on their voyage, without any accident, and landed in Savoy, where Peter placed her upon the horse, and himself walk∣ed beside her. When he came within sight of his native mountains, his extravagant joy burst forth into frequent exclamations, and he would often ask Adeline if she had ever seen such <HI>hills</HI> in France. <Q REND="inline">"No, no,"</Q> said he, <Q REND="inline">"the hills there are very well for French hills, but they are not to be named on the same day with ours."</Q> Adeline, lost
<PB N="124" REF="123"/>
in admiration of the astonishing and tremen∣dous scenery around her, assented very warmly to the truth of Peter's assertion, which encouraged him to expatiate more largely upon the advantages of his country; its disadvantages he totally forgot; and though he gave away his last sous to the children of the peasantry that run barefooted by the side of the horse, he spoke of nothing but the happiness and content of the inhabi∣tants.</P>
<P>His native village, indeed, was an excep∣tion to the general character of the coun∣try, and to the usual effects of an arbitrary government; it was flourishing, healthy, and happy; and these advantages it chiefly owed to the activity and attention of the benevolent clergyman whose cure it was:</P>
<P>Adeline, who now began to feel the effects of long anxiety and fatigue, much wish∣ed to arrive at the end of her journey, and inquired impatiently of Peter concerning it. Her spirits, thus weakened, the gloomy grandeur of the scenes which had so lately awakened emotions of delightful sublimity, now awed her into terror; she trembled at the sound of the torrents rolling among the clifts and thundering in the vale below, and shrunk from the view of the precipices, which sometimes overhung the road, and at others appeared beneath it. Fatigued as
<PB N="125" REF="124"/>
she was, she frequently dismounted to climb on foot the steep flinty road, which she feared to travel on horseback.</P>
<P>The day was closing when they drew near a small village at the foot of the Savoy Alps, and the sun, in all his evening splendour, now sinking behind their summits, threw a farewell gleam athwart the landscape, so soft and glowing as drew from Adeline, languid as she was, an exclamation of rap∣ture.</P>
<P>The romantic situation of the village next attracted her notice. It stood at the foot of several stupendous mountains, which formed a chain round a lake at some little distance, and the woods that swept from their summits almost embosomed the village. The lake, unruffled by the lightest air, re∣flected the vermeil tints of the horizon with the sublime scenery on its borders, darken∣ing every instant with the falling twilight.</P>
<P>When Peter perceived the village, he burst into a shout of joy. <Q REND="inline">"Thank God,"</Q> said he, <Q REND="inline">"we are near home; there is my dear native place. It looks just as it did twenty years ago; and there are the same old trees growing round our cottage yonder, and the huge rock that rises above it. My poor father died there, Ma'amselle. Pray heaven my sister be alive; it is a long while since I saw her."</Q>
<PB N="126" REF="125"/>
Adeline listened with a melancholy plea∣sure to these artless expressions of Peter, who, in retracing the scenes of his former days, seemed to live them over again. As they approached the village, he continued to point out various objects of his remembrance. <Q REND="inline">"And there too is the good pastor's chateau; look, Ma'amselle, that white house, with the smoke curling, that stands on the edge of the lake yonder. I wonder whe∣ther he is alive yet. He was not old when I left the place, and as much be∣loved as ever man was; but death spares nobody!"</Q></P>
<P>They had by this time reached the vil∣lage which was extremely neat, though it did not promise much accommodation. Peter had hardly advanced ten steps be∣fore he was accosted by some of his old acquaintance, who shook hands, and seemed not to know how to part with him. He in∣quired for his sister, and was told she was alive and well. As they passed on, so many of his old friends flocked round him, that Adeline became quite weary of the delay. Many whom he had left in the vigour of life were now tottering under the infirmities of age, whiletheir sons and daughters, whom he had known only in the playfulness of in∣fancy, were grown from his remembrance, and in the pride of youth. At length they
<PB N="127" REF="126"/>
approached the cottage, and were met by his sister, who, having heard of his ar∣rival, came and welcomed him with unfeign∣ed joy.</P>
<P>On seeing Adeline, she seemed surprized, but assisted her to alight, and conducting her into a small but neat cottage, received her with a warmth of ready kindness which would have graced a better situation. Ade∣line desired to speak with her alone, for the room was now crowded with Peter's friends, and then acquainting her with such particulars of her circumstances as it was necessary to communicate, desired to know if she could be accommodated with lodging in the cottage. <Q REND="inline">"Yes, Ma'amselle,"</Q> said the good woman, <Q REND="inline">"such as it is, you are hear∣tily welcome. I am only sorry it is not better. But you seem ill, Ma'amselle; what shall I get you?"</Q></P>
<P>Adeline, who had been long struggling with fatigue and indisposition, now yielded to their pressure. She said she was, indeed, ill; but hoped that rest would restore her, and desired a bed might be immediately pre∣pared. The good woman went out to obey her, and soon returning, shewed her to a little cabin, where she retired to a bed, whose cleanliness was its only recommen∣dation.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="127"/>
But, notwithstanding her fatigue, she could not sleep, and her mind, in spite of all her efforts, returned to the scenes that were passed, or presented gloomy and imper∣fect visions of the future.</P>
<P>The difference between her own con∣dition and that of other persons, educa∣ted as she had been, struck her forcibly, and she wept. <Q REND="inline">"They,"</Q> said she, <Q REND="inline">"have friends and relations, all striving to save them not only from what may hurt, but what may displease them; watching not only for their present safety, but for their future advantage, and preventing them even from injuring themselves. But dur∣ing my whole life I have never known a friend; have been in general surrounded by enemies, and very seldom exempt from some circumstance either of danger or calamity. Yet surely I am not born to be for ever wretched; the time will come when"—</Q>She began to think she might one time be happy; but recollecting the des∣perate situation of Theodore, <Q REND="inline">"No,"</Q> said she, <Q REND="inline">"I can never hope even for peace!"</Q></P>
<P>Early the following morning the good woman of the house came to inquire how she had rested, and found she had slept little, and was much worse than on the preceding night. The uneasiness of her mind contributed to heighten the feverish sypmtoms that attended
<PB N="129" REF="128"/>
her, and in the course of the day her dis∣order began to assume a serious aspect. She observed its progress with composure, re∣signing herself to the will of God, and feel∣ing little to regret in life. Her kind hostess did every thing in her power to relieve her, and there was neither physician nor apo∣thecary in the village, so that nature was deprived of none of her advantages. Not∣withstanding this, the disorder rapidly in∣creased, and on the third day from its first attack she became delirious; after which she sunk into a state of stupefaction.</P>
<P>How long she remained in this deplorable condition she knew not; but, on recovering her senses, she found herself in an apart∣ment very different from any she remember∣ed. It was spacious and almost beautiful, the bed and every thing around being in one stile of elegant simplicity. For some mi∣nutes she lay in a trance of surprise, endea∣vouring to recollect her scattered ideas of the past, and almost fearing to move, lest the pleasing vision should vanish from her eyes.</P>
<P>At length she ventured to raise herself, when she presently heard a soft voice speak∣ing near her, and the bed curtain on one side was gently undrawn by a beautiful girl. As she leaned forward over the bed, and with a smile of mingled tenderness and joy inquired of her patient how she did, Ade∣line
<PB N="130" REF="129"/>
gazed in silent admiration upon the most interesting female countenance she had ever seen, in which the expression of sweet∣ness, united with lively sense and refine∣ment, was chastened by simplicity.</P>
<P>Adeline at length recollected herself suf∣ficiently to thank her kind inquirer, and begged to know to whom she was obliged, and where she was? The lovely girl press∣ed her hand, <Q REND="inline">"'Tis we who are obliged,"</Q> said she. <Q REND="inline">"Oh! how I rejoice to find that you have recovered your recollection."</Q> She said no more, but flew to the door of the apartment, and disappeared. In a few minutes she returned with an elderly lady, who, approaching the bed with an air of tender interest, asked concerning the state of Adeline; to which the latter replied, as well as the agitation of her spirits would per∣mit, and repeated her desire of knowing to whom she was so greatly obliged. <Q REND="inline">"You shall know that hereafter,"</Q> said the lady; <Q REND="inline">"at present be assured that you are with those who will think their care much over∣paid by your recovery; submit, there∣fore, to every thing that may conduce to it, and consent to be kept as quiet as pos∣sible."</Q></P>
<P>Adeline gratefully smiled, and bowed her head in silent assent. The lady now quitted the room for a medicine; having given
<PB N="131" REF="130"/>
which to Adeline, the curtain was closed, and she was left to repose. But her thoughts were too busy to suffer her to profit by the opportunity. She contemplated the past, and viewed the present, and, when she compared them, the contrast struck her with astonishment. The whole appeared like one of those sudden transitions so frequent in dreams, in which we pass from grief and despair, we know not how, to comfort and delight.</P>
<P>Yet she looked forward to the future with a trembling anxiety, that threatened to re∣tard her recovery, and which, when she remembered the words of her generous be∣nefactress, she endeavoured to suppress. Had she better known the disposition of the per∣sons in whose house she now was, her anxi∣ety, as far as it regarded herself, must in a great measure have been done away; for La Luc, its owner, was one of those rare characters to whom misfortune seldom looks in vain, and whose native goodness, con∣firmed by principle, is uniform and unas∣suming in its acts. The following little pic∣ture of his domestic life, his family and his manners, will more fully illustrate his cha∣racter. It was drawn from the life, and its exactness will, it is hoped, compensate for its length.

<BIBL>CAWTHORNE.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>In the village of Leloncourt, celebrated for its picturesque situation at the foot of the Savoy Alps, lived Arnaud La Luc, a clergyman, descended from an ancient fa∣mily of France, whose decayed fortunes occasioned them to seek a retreat in Swit∣zerland, in an age when the violence of civil commotion seldom spared the conquer∣ed. He was minister of the village, and equally loved for the piety and benevolence of the Christian as respected for the dignity and elevation of the philosopher. His was the philosophy of nature, directed by com∣mon sense. He despised the jargon o the modern schools and the brilliant absurdities of systems, which have dazzled without en∣lightening,
<PB N="133" REF="132"/>
and guided without convincing their disciples.</P>
<P>His mind was penetrating; his views ex∣tensive; and his systems, like his religion, were simple, rational, and sublime. The people of his parish looked up to him as to a father; for while his precepts directed their minds, his example touched their hearts.</P>
<P>In early youth La Luc lost a wife, whom he tenderly loved. This event threw a tincture of soft and interesting melancholy over his character, which remained when time had mellowed the remembrance that occasioned it. Philosophy had strengthened, not hardened, his heart; it enabled him to resist the pressure of affliction, rather than to overcome it.</P>
<P>Calamity taught him to feel with peculiar sympathy the distresses of others. His income from the parish was small, and what remain∣ed from the divided and reduced estates of his ancestors did not much increase it; but though he could not always relieve the necessities of the indigent, his tender pity and holy conversation seldom failed in administering consolation to the mental sufferer. On these occasions the sweet and exquisite emotions of his heart have often induced him to say, that could the voluptuary be once sensible of these feelings, he would never after forego
<PB N="134" REF="133"/>
<Q REND="inline">"the luxury of doing good."—</Q><Q REND="inline">"Igno∣rance of true pleasure,"</Q> he would say, <Q REND="inline">"more frequently than temptation to that which is false, leads to vice."</Q></P>
<P>La Luc had one son and a daughter, who were too young, when their mother died, to lament their loss. He loved them with peculiar tenderness, as the children of her whom he never ceased to deplore; and it was for some time his sole amusement to observe the gradual unfolding of their infant minds, and to bend them to virtue. His was the deep and silent sorrow of the heart; his complaints he never obtruded upon others, and very seldom did he even men∣tion his wife. His grief was too sacred for the eye of the vulgar. Often he retired to the deep solitude of the mountains, and amid their solemn and tremendous scenery would brood over the remembrance of times past, and resign himself to the luxury of grief. On his return from these little ex∣cursions he was always more placid and con∣tented. A sweet tranquillity, which arose almost to happiness, was diffused over his mind, and his manners were more than usually benevolent. As he gazed on his children, and fondly kissed them, a tear would sometimes steal into his eye, but it was a tear of tender regret, unmingled with
<PB N="135" REF="134"/>
the darker qualities of sorrow, and was most precious to his heart.</P>
<P>On the death of his wife he received into his house a maiden sister, a sensible worthy woman, who was deeply interested in the happiness of her brother. Her affec∣tionate attention and judicious conduct an∣ticipated the effect of time in softening the poignancy of his distress, and her unremit∣ted care of his children, while it proved the goodness of her own heart, attracted her more closely to his.</P>
<P>It was with inexpressible pleasure that he traced in the infant features of Clara the re∣semblance of her mother. The same gen∣tleness of manner and the same sweetness of disposition soon displayed themselves, and as she grew up, her actions frequently re∣minded him so strongly of his lost wife as to fix him in reveries, which absorbed all his soul.</P>
<P>Engaged in the duties of his parish, the education of his children, and in philosophic research, his years passed in tranquillity. The tender melancholy with which afflic∣tion had tinctured his mind was, by long indulgence, become dear to him, and he would not have relinquished it for the bright∣est dream of airy happiness. When any passing incident disturbed him, he retired for consolation to the idea of her he so faith∣fully
<PB N="136" REF="135"/>
loved, and yielding to a gentle, and what the world would call a romantic, sad∣ness, gradually reassumed his composure. This was the secret luxury to which he withdrew from temporary disappointment—the solitary enjoyment which dissipated the cloud of care, and blunted the sting of vex∣ation—which elevated his mind above this world, and opened to his view the sublimi∣ty of another.</P>
<P>The spot he now inhabited, the surround∣ing scenery, the romantic beauties of the neighbouring walks, were dear to La Luc, for they had once been loved by Clara; they had been the scenes of her tenderness, and of his happiness.</P>
<P>His chateau stood on the borders of a small lake that was almost environed by mountains of stupendous height, which, shooting into a variety of grotesque forms, composed a scenery singularly solemn and sublime. Dark woods intermingled with bold projections of rock, sometimes barren, and sometimes covered with the purple bloom of wild flowers, impended over the lake, and were seen in the clear mirror of its waters. The wild and alpine heights which rose above were either crowned with perpetual snows, or exhibited tremendous crags and masses of solid rock, whose ap∣pearance was continually changing as the
<PB N="137" REF="136"/>
rays of light were variously reflected on their surface, and whose summits were often wrapt in impenetrable mists. Some cottages and hamlets, scattered on the margin of the lake, or seated in picturesque points of view on the rocks above, were the only objects that reminded the beholder of humanity.</P>
<P>On the side of the lake, nearly opposite to the chateau, the mountains receded, and a long chain of alps was seen stretching in perspective. Their innumerable tints and shades, some veiled in blue mists, some tinged with rich purple, and others glit∣tering in partial light, gave luxurious and magical colouring to the scene.</P>
<P>The chateau was not large, but it was convenient, and was characterised by an air of elegant simplicity and good order. The entrance was a small hall, which opening by a glass door into the garden, afforded a view of the lake, with the magnificent scenery exhibited on its bor∣ders. On the left of the hall was La Luc's study, where he usually passed his mornings; and adjoining was a small room fitted up with chymical apparatus, astronomical instruments, and other im∣plements of science. On the right was the family parlour, and behind it a room which belonged exclusively to Madame
<PB N="138" REF="137"/>
La Luc. Here were deposited various me∣dicines and botanical distillations, together with the apparatus for preparing them. From this room the whole village was liberally supplied with physical comfort; for it was the pride of Madame to believe herself skilful in relieving the disorders of her neighbours.</P>
<P>Behind the chateau rose a tuft of pines, and in front a gentle declivity, covered with verdure and flowers, extended to the lake, whose waters flowed even with the grass, and gave freshness to the acacias that waved over its surface. Flowering shrubs, intermingled with mountain ash, cypress, and ever-green oak, marked the boundary of the garden.</P>
<P>At the return of spring it was Clara's care to direct the young shoots of the plants, to nurse the budding flowers, and to shelter them with the luxuriant branches of the shrubs from the cold blasts that descended from the mountains. In summer she usually rose with the sun, and visited her favourite flowers while the dew yet hung glittering on their leaves. The freshness of early day, with the glowing colouring which then touched the scenery, gave a pure and exquisite delight to her innocent heart. Born amid scenes of grandeur and sublimity, she had quickly imbibed a taste for their charms, which taste was heightened by the influence
<PB N="139" REF="138"/>
of a warm imagination. To view the sun rising above the alps, tinging their snowy heads with light, and suddenly darting his rays over the whole face of nature—to fee the fiery splendour of the clouds reflected in the laek below, and the roseate tints first steal upon the rocks above—were among the earliest pleasures of which Clara was susceptible. From being delighted with the observance of nature, she grew pleased with seeing her finely imitated, and soon displayed a taste for poetry and painting. When she was about sixteen she often selected from her father's library those of the Italian poets most celebrated for picturesque beauty, and would spend the first hours of morning in reading them under the shade of the acacias that bordered the lake. Here too she would often attempt rude sketches of the surrounding scenery, and at length by repeated efforts, assisted by some instruction from her brother, she succeeded so well as to produce twelve drawings in crayon, which were judged worthy of decorating the parlour of the chateau.</P>
<P>Young La Luc played the flute, and she listened to him with exquisite delight, particularly when he stood on the margin of the lake, under her beloved acacias. Her voice was sweet and flexible, thought not strong, and she soon learned to modulate
<PB N="140" REF="139"/>
it to the instrument. She knew nothing of the intricacies of execution; her airs were simple, and her style equally so, but she soon gave them a touching expression, inspired by the sensibility of her heart, which seldom left those of her hearers unaffected.</P>
<P>It was the happiness of La Luc to see his children happy, and in one of his excursions to Geneva, whither he went to visit some relations of his late wife, he bought Clara a lute. She received it with more gratitude than she could express; and having learned one air, she hastened to her favourite acacias, and played it again and again till she forgot every thing besides. Her little domestic duties, her books, her drawing, even the hour which her father dedicated to her improvement, when she met her brother in the library, and with him partook of knowledge, even this hour passed unheeded by. La Luc suffered it to pass. Madame was displeased that her niece neglected her domestic duties, and wished to reprove her, but La Luc begged she would be silent. <Q REND="inline">"Let expe∣rience teach her her error,"</Q> said he; <Q REND="inline">"precept seldom brings conviction to young minds."</Q></P>
<P>Madame objected that experience was a slow teacher. <Q REND="inline">"It is a sure one,"</Q> replied La Luc, <Q REND="inline">"and is not unfrequently the quickest of all teachers: when it can∣not
<PB N="141" REF="140"/>
lead us into serious evil, it is well to trust to it."</Q></P>
<P>The second day passed with Clara as the first, and the third as the second. She could now play several tunes; she came to her father and repeated what she had learnt.</P>
<P>At supper the cream was not dressed, and there was no fruit on the table. La Luc inquired the reason; Clara recollected it, and blushed. She observed that her brother was absent, but nothing was said. Toward the conclusion of the repast he appeared; his countenance expressed unusual satisfaction, but he seated himself in silence. Clara inqui∣red what had detained him from supper, and learnt that he had been to a sick family in the neighbourhood with the weekly allow∣ance which her father gave them. La Luc had entrusted the care of this family to his daughter, and it was her duty to have carried them their little allowance on the preceding day, but she had forgot every thing but music.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"How did you find the woman?"</Q> said La Luc to his son. <Q REND="inline">"Worse, Sir,"</Q> he replied, <Q REND="inline">"for her medicines had not been regularly given, and the children had had little or no food to-day."</Q></P>
<P>Clara was shocked. <Q REND="inline">"No food to-day!"</Q> said she to herself, <Q REND="inline">"and I have been playing all day on my lute, under the aca∣cias by the lake!"</Q> Her father did not
<PB N="142" REF="141"/>
seem to observe her emotion, but turned to his son. <Q REND="inline">"I left her better,"</Q> said the latter; <Q REND="inline">"the medicines I carried eased her pain, and I had the pleasure to see her children make a joyful <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>pper."</Q></P>
<P>Clara, perhaps for the first time in her life, envied him his pleasure; her heart was full, and she sat silent. <Q REND="inline">"No food to day!"</Q> thought she.</P>
<P>She retired pensively to her chamber. The sweet serenity with which she usually went to rest was vanished, for she could no longer reflect on the past day with satisfaction.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What a pity,"</Q> said she, <Q REND="inline">"that what is so pleasing should be the cause of so much pain! This lute is my delight, and my torment!"</Q> This reflection occasioned her much internal debate; but before she could come to any resolution upon the point in question, she fell asleep.</P>
<P>She awoke very early the next morning, and impatiently watched the progress of the dawn. The sun at lenth appearing, she arose, and, determined to make all the a∣tonement in her power for her former neg∣lect, hastened to the cottage.</P>
<P>Here she remained a considerable time, and when she returned to the chateau her countenance had recovered all its usual sere∣nity. She resolved, however, not to touch her lute that day.</P>

Till the hour of breakfast she busied herself in binding up the flowers, and pruning the shoots that were too luxuriant, and she at length found herself, she scarcely knew how, beneath her beloved acacias by the side of the lake. <Q REND="inline">"Ah!"</Q> said she, with a sigh, <Q REND="inline">"how sweetly would the song I learned yesterday, sound now over the waters!"</Q> But she remembered her determination, and checked the step she was involuntarily tak∣ing towards the chateau.</P>
<P>She attended her father in the library at the usual hour, and learned, from his discourse with her brother on what had been read the two preceding days, that she had lost much entertaining knowledge. She request∣ed her father would inform her to what this conversation alluded; but he calmly re∣plied, that she had preferred another amuse∣ment at the time when the subject was dis∣cussed, and must therefore content herself with ignorance. <Q REND="inline">"You would reap the rewards of study from the amusements of idle∣ness,"</Q> said he; <Q REND="inline">"learn to be reasonable—d not expect to unite inconsistencies."</Q></P>
<P>Clara felt the justness of this rebuke, and remembered her lute. <Q REND="inline">"What mischief has it occasioned!"</Q> sighed she. <Q REND="inline">"Yes, I am determined not to touch it at all this day. I will prove that I am able to controul my inclinations when I see it
<PB N="144" REF="143"/>
is necessary so to do."</Q> Thus resolving, she applied herself to study with more than usual assiduity.</P>
<P>She adhered to her resolution, and to∣wards the close of day went into the garden to amuse herself. The evening was still and uncommonly beautiful. Nothing was heard but the faint <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ing of the leaves, which returned but a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ervals, making silence more solenm, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> distant murmurs of the torrents that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ed among the cliffs. As she stood by the lake, and watched the sun slowly sinking below the alps, whose summits were tinged with gold and purple; as she saw the last rays of light gleam upon the waters whose surface was not curled by the lightest air, she sighed, <Q REND="inline">"Oh! how enchanting would be the sound of my lute at this moment, on this spot, and when every thing is so still around me!"</Q></P>
<P>The temptation was too powerful for the resolution of Clara: she ran to the chateau, returned with the instrument to her dear acacias, and beneath their shade continued to play till the surrounding objects faded in in darkness from her sight. But the moon arose, and, shedding a trembling lustre on the lake, made the scene more captivating than ever.</P>
<P>It was impossible to quit so delightful a spot; Clara repeated her favourite airs again
<PB N="145" REF="144"/>
and again. The beauty of the hour awaken∣ed all her genius; she never played with such expression before, and she listened with in∣creasing rapture to the tones as they languish∣ed over the waters and died away on the dis∣tant air. She was perfectly enchanted <Q REND="inline">"No! nothing was ever so delightful as to play on the lute beneath her acacias, on the margin of the lake, by moon∣light!"</Q></P>
<P>When she returned to the chateau, supper was over. La Luc had observed Clara, and would not suffer her to be interrupt∣ed.</P>
<P>When the enthusiasm of the hour was passed she recollected that she had broken her resolution, and the reflection gave her pain. <Q REND="inline">"I prided myself on controling my incli∣nations,"</Q> said she, <Q REND="inline">"and I have weakly yielded to their direction. But what evil have I incurred by indulging them this evening? I have neglected no duty, for I had none to perform. Of what then have I to accuse myself? It would have been absurd to have kept my resolution, and denied myself a pleasure when there ap∣peared no reason for this self-denial."</Q></P>
<P>She paused, not quite satisfied with this reasoning. Suddenly resuming her enquiry, <Q REND="inline">"But how,"</Q> said she, <Q REND="inline">"am I certain that I should have resisted my inclinations if
<PB N="146" REF="145"/>
there <HI>had</HI> been a reason for opposing them? If the poor family whom I neglected yes∣terday had been unsupplied to day, I fear I should again have forgotten them while I played on my lute on the banks of the lake."</Q></P>
<P>She then recollected all that her father had at different times said on the sub∣ject of self-command, and she felt some pain.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No,"</Q> said she, <Q REND="inline">"if I do not consider that to preserve a resolution, which I have once solemnly formed, is a sufficient rea∣son to control my inclinations, I fear no other motive would long restrain me. I seriously determined not to touch my lute this whole day, and I have broken my resolution. To-morrow perhaps I may be tempted to neglect some duty, for I have discovered that I cannot rely on my own prudence. Since I cannot conquer temp∣tation, I will fly from it."</Q></P>
<P>On the following morning she brought her lute to La Luc, and begged he would re∣ceive it again, and at least keep it till she had taught her inclinations to submit to con∣trol.</P>
<P>The heart of La Luc swelled as she spoke. <Q REND="inline">"No, Clara,"</Q> said he, <Q REND="inline">"it is unnecessary that I should receive your lute; the sa∣crifice you would make proves you wor∣thy
<PB N="147" REF="146"/>
of my confidence. Take back the instrument; since you have sufficient reso∣lution to resign it when it leads you from duty, I doubt not that you will be able to control its influence now that it is restored to you."</Q></P>
<P>Clara felt a degree of pleasure and pride at these words, such as she had never before experienced; but she thought, that to de∣serve the commendation they bestowed, it was necessary to complete the sacrifice she had begun. In the virtuous enthusiasm of the moment the delights of music were forgotten in those of aspiring to well-earned praise, and when she refused the lute thus offered, she was conscious only of exquisite sensations. <Q REND="inline">"Dear Sir,"</Q> said she, tears of pleasure swelling in her eyes, <Q REND="inline">"allow me to deserve the praises you bestow, and then I shall indeed be happy."</Q></P>
<P>La Luc thought she had never resembled her mother so much as at this instant, and, tenderly kissing her, he for some moments wept in silence. When he was able to speak, <Q REND="inline">"You do already deserve my praises,"</Q> said he, <Q REND="inline">"and I restore your lute as a reward for the conduct which excites them."</Q> This scene called back recollections too tender for the heart of La Luc, and giving Clara the inst ument, he abruptly quitted the room.</P>
<P><PB N="148" REF="147"/>
La Luc's son, a youth of much promise, was designed by his father for the church, and had received from him an excellent edu∣cation, which, however, it was thought necessary he should finish at an university. That of Geneva was fixed upon by La Luc. His scheme had been to make his son not a scholar only; he was ambitious that he should also be enviable as a man. From early infancy he had accustomed him to hardihood and endurance, and, as he ad∣vanced in youth, he encouraged him in manly exercises, and acquainted him with the useful arts as well as with abstract sci∣ence.</P>
<P>He was high spirited and ardent in his temper, but his heart was generous and af∣fectionate. He looked forward to Geneva, and to the new world it would disclose, with the sanguine expectations of youth; and in the delight of these expectations was absorbed the regret he would otherwise have felt at a separation from his family.</P>
<P>A brother of the late Madame La Luc, who was by birth an English woman, re∣sided at Geneva with his family. To have been related to his wife was a sufficient claim upon the heart of La Luc, and he had, therefore, always kept up an intercourse with Mr. Audley, though the difference in their characters and manner of thinking would
<PB N="149" REF="148"/>
never permit this association to advance into friendship. La Luc now wrote to him, sig∣nifying an intention of sending his son to Geneva, and recommending him to his care; to this letter Mr. Audley returned a friendly answer, and a short time after an acquain∣tance of La Luc's being called to Geneva, he determined that his son should accompany him. The separation was painful to La Luc, and almost insupportable to Clara. Madame was grieved, and took care that he should have a sufficient quantity of medicines put up in his travelling trunk; she was also at some pains to point out their virtues, and the different complaints for which they were requisite; but she was careful to deli∣ver her lecture during the absence of her brother.</P>
<P>La Luc, with his daughter, accompanied his son on horseback to the next town, which was about eight miles from Leloncourt, and there again enforcing all the advice he had formerly given him respecting his conduct and pursuits, and again yielding to the ten∣der weakness of the father, he bade him farewell. Clara wept, and felt more sorrow at this parting than the occasion could justi∣fy; but this was almost the first time she had known grief, and she artlessly yielded to its influence.</P>
<P>La Luc and Clara travelled pensively
<PB N="150" REF="149"/>
back, and the day was closing when they came within view of the lake, and soon after of the chateau. Never had it appeared gloomy till now; but now Clara wandered forlornly through every deserted apartment where she had been accustomed to see her brother, and recollected a thousand little circumstances, which, had he been present, she would have thought immaterial, but on which imagination now stamped a value. the garden, the scenes around, all wore a melancholy aspect, and it was long ere they resumed their natural character and Clara re∣covered her vivacity.</P>
<P>Near four years had elapsed since this separation when one evening, as Madame La Luc and her niece were sitting at work together, in the parlour, a good woman in the neighbourhood desired to be admitted. She came to ask for some medicines, and the advice of Madame La Luc. <Q REND="inline">"Here is a sad accident happened at our house, Madame,"</Q> said she; <Q REND="inline">"I am sure my heart aches for the poor young creature."—</Q>Madame La Luc desired she would explain herself, and the woman proceeded to say, that her brother Peter, whom she had not seen for so many years, was arrived, and had brought a young lady to her cottage, who she verily believed was dying. She described her dis∣order, and acquainted Madame with what
<PB N="151" REF="150"/>
particulars of her mournful story Peter had related, failing not to exaggerate such as her compassion for the unhappy stranger and her love of the marvellous prompted.</P>
<P>The account appeared a very extraor∣dinary one to Madame; but pity for the forlorn condition of the young sufferer induced her to inquire farther into the af∣fair. <Q REND="inline">"Do let me go to her, Madam,"</Q> said Clara, who had been listening with ready compassion to the poor woman's narrative: <Q REND="inline">"do suffer me to go—she must want comforts, and I wish much to see how she is."</Q> Madame asked some farther questions concerning her disorder, and then, taking off her spectacles, she rose from her chair and said she would go herself. Clara desired to accompany her. They put on their hats and followed the good woman to the cottage, where, in a very small, close room, on a miserable bed, lay Adeline, pale, emaciated, and uncon∣scious of all around her. Madame turned to the woman, and asked how long she had been in this way, while Clara went up to the bed, and taking the almost lifeless hand that lay on the quilt, looked anxiously in her face. <Q REND="inline">"She observes nothing,"</Q> said she, <Q REND="inline">"poor creature! I wish she was at the chateau, she would be better accom∣modated, and I could nurse her there,"</Q>
<PB N="152" REF="151"/>
The woman told Madame La Luc, that the young lady had lain in that state for several hours. Madame examined her pulse, and shook her head. <Q REND="inline">"This room is very close,"</Q> said she.—<Q REND="inline">"Very close indeed,"</Q> cried Clara, eagerly; <Q REND="inline">"surely she would be better at the chateau, if she could be moved."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"We will see you about that,"</Q> said her aunt. <Q REND="inline">"In the mean time let me speak to Peter; it is some years since I saw him."</Q> She went to the outer room, and the woman ran out of the cottage to look for him. When she was gone, <Q REND="inline">"This is a miserable habitation for the poor stranger,"</Q> said Clara; <Q REND="inline">"she will never be well here: do, Madam, let her be carried to our house; I am sure my father would wish it. Besides, there is something in her features, even inanimate as they now are, that prejudices me in her favour."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Shall I never persuade you to give up that romantic notion of judging people by their faces,"</Q> said her aunt. <Q REND="inline">"What sort of a face she has, is of very little consequence—her condition is lamentable, and I am desirous of al∣tering it; but I wish first to ask Peter a few questions concerning her."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Thank you, my dear aunt,"</Q> said Clara; <Q REND="inline">"she will be removed then."</Q> Ma∣dame
<PB N="153" REF="152"/>
La Luc was going to reply; but Peter now entered, and, expressing great joy at seeing her again, inquired how Monsieur La Luc and Clara did. Clara immediately wel∣comed honest Peter to his native place, and he returned her salutation with many expres∣sions of surprise at finding her <HI>so much grown.</HI> <Q REND="inline">"Though I have so often dandled you in my arms, Ma'amselle, I should never have known you again. Young twigs shoot fast, as they say."</Q></P>
<P>Madame La Luc now inquired into the particulars of Adeline's story, and heard as much as Peter knew of it, being only that his late master found her in a very distressed situation, and that he had himself brought her from the Abbey to save her from a French Marquis. The simplicity of Peter's manner would not suffer her to question his veracity, though some of the circumstances he re∣lated excited all her surprise, and awaken∣ed all her pity. Tears frequently stood in Clara's eyes during the course of his narra∣tive, and when he concluded, she said, <Q REND="inline">"Dear Madam, I am sure when my father learns the history of this unhappy young woman, he will not refuse to be a parent to her, and I will be her sister."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"She deserves it all,"</Q> said Peter, <Q REND="inline">"for she is very good indeed."</Q> He then proceeded in a strain of praise, which was very unusual
<PB N="154" REF="153"/>
with him.—<Q REND="inline">"I will go home and consult with my brother about her,"</Q> said Madame La Luc, rising: <Q REND="inline">"she certainly ought to be removed to a more airy room. The chateau is so near, that I think she may be carried thither without much risk."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Heaven bless you! Madam,"</Q> cried Pe∣ter, rubbing his hands, <Q REND="inline">"for your goodness to my poor young lady."</Q></P>
<P>La Luc had just returned from his evening walk when they reached the chateau. Ma∣dame told him where she had been, and re∣lated the history of Adeline and her present condition. <Q REND="inline">"By all means have her re∣moved hither,"</Q> said La Luc, whose eyes bore testimony to the tenderness of his heart. <Q REND="inline">"She can be better attended to here than in Susan's cottage."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I knew you would say so, my dear father,"</Q> said Clara: <Q REND="inline">"I will go and order the green bed to be prepared for her."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Be patient, niece,"</Q> said Madame La Luc: <Q REND="inline">"there is no occasion for such haste: some things are to be considered first; but you are young and romantic."—</Q>La Luc smiled.—<Q REND="inline">"The evening is now closed,"</Q> resumed Madame; <Q REND="inline">"it will, therefore, be dangerous to remove her before morning. Early to-morrow a room shall be got rea∣dy, and she shall be brought here; in the mean time I will go and make up a medi∣cine,
<PB N="155" REF="154"/>
which I hope may be of service to her."—</Q>Clara reluctantly assented to this delay, and Madame La Luc retired to her closet.</P>
<P>On the following morning Adeline, wrapped in blankets, and sheltered as much as possible from the air, was brought to the chateau, where the good La Luc desired she might have every attention paid her, and where Clara watched over her with unceasing anxiety and tenderness. She remained in a state of torpor during the greater part of the day, but towards evening she breathed more freely; and Clara, who still watched by her bed, had at length the pleasure of perceiving that her senses were restored. It was at this moment that she found herself in the situation from which we have digressed to give this ac∣count of the venerable La Luc and his family. The reader will find that his virtues and his friendship to Adeline deserved this notice.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>ADELINE, assisted by a fine consti∣tution, and the kind at<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>entions of her new friends, was in a little more than a week so much recovered as to leave her chamber. She was introduced to La Luc, whom she met with tears of gratitude, and thanked for his goodness in a manner so warm, yet so artless, as interested him still more in her favour. During the progress of her recovery, the sweetness of her behaviour had entirely won the heart of Clara, and greatly interested that of her aunt, whose re∣ports of Adeline, together with the praises bestowed by Clara, had excited both esteem and curiosity in the breast of La Luc; and he now met her with an expression of benig∣nity which spoke peace and comfort to her heart. She had acquainted Madame La Luc with such particulars of her story as Peter, either through ignorance or inattention, had not communicated, suppressing only, through a false delicacy, perhaps, an ac∣knowledgement of her attachment to Theo∣dore.
<PB N="157" REF="156"/>
These circumstances were repeated to La Luc, who, ever sensible to the sufferings of others, was particularly interested by the singular misfortunes of Adeline.</P>
<P>Near a fortnight had elapsed since her removal to the chateau, when one morning La Luc desired to speak with her alone. She followed him into his study, and then in a manner the most delicate he told her, that, as he found she was so unfortunate in her father, he desired she would henceforth con∣sider him as her parent, and his house as her home. <Q REND="inline">"You and Clara shall be equally my daughters,"</Q> continued he; <Q REND="inline">"I am rich in having such children."</Q> The strong emotions of surprise and gratitude for some time kept Adeline silent. <Q REND="inline">"Do not thank me,"</Q> said La Luc; <Q REND="inline">"I know all you would say, and I know also that I am but doing my duty. I thank God that my duty and my pleasures are generally in unison."</Q> Adeline wiped away the tears which his goodness had excited, and was going to speak; but La Luc pressed her hand, and, turning away to conceal his emotion, walked out of the room.</P>
<P>Adeline was now considered as a part of the family, and in the parental kindness of La Luc, the sisterly affection of Clara, and the steady and uniform regard of Ma∣dame, she would have been happy as she was
<PB N="158" REF="157"/>
thankful, had not unceasing anxiety for the fate of Theodore, of whom in this solitude she was less likely than ever to hear, corroded her heart, and embittered every moment of reflection. Even when sleep obliterated for a while the memory of the past, his image frequently arose to her fancy, accompanied by all the exaggerations of terror. She saw him in chains, and struggling in the grasp of ruffians, or saw him led, amidst the dread∣ful preparations for execution, into the field: she saw the agony of his look, and heard him repeat her name in frantic accents till the horrors of the scene overcame her, and she awoke.</P>
<P>A similarity of taste and character at∣tached her to Clara, yet the misery that preyed upon her heart was of a nature too delicate to be spoken of, and she never mentioned Theodore even to her friend. Her illness had yet left her weak and languid, and the perpetual anxiety of her mind contributed to prolong this state. She endeavoured, by strong and almost continual efforts, to abstract her thoughts from their mournful subject, and was often successful. La Luc had an excellant library, and the instruction it offered at once gratified her love of knowledge, and withdrew her mind from painful recollections. His con∣versation
<PB N="159" REF="158"/>
too afforded her another refuge from misery.</P>
<P>But her chief amusement was to wander among the sublime scenery of the adjacent country, sometimes with Clara, though often with no other companion than a book. There were indeed times when the conver∣sation of her friend imposed a painful re∣straint, and, when given up to reflection she would ramble alone through scenes, whose solitary grandeur assisted and soothed the melancholy of her heart. Here she would retrace all the conduct of her beloved Theo∣dore, and endeavour to recollect his exact countenance, his air, and manner. Now she would weep at the remembrance and then, suddenly considering that he had per∣haps already suffered an ignominious death for her sake, even in consequence of the very action which had proved his love, a dreadful despair would seize her, and, arresting her tears, would threaten to bear down every barrier that fortitude and reason could oppose.</P>
<P>Fearing longer to trust her own thoughts, she would hurry home, and by a desperate effort would try to lose, in the conversa∣tion of La Luc, the remembrance of the past. Her melancholy, when he observed it, La Luc attributed to a sense of the cruel treatment she had received from her
<PB N="160" REF="159"/>
father; a circumstance which, by exciting his compassion, endeared her more strongly to his heart; while that love of rational conversation, which in her calmer hours so frequently appeared, opened to him a new source of amusement in the cultivation of a mind eager for knowledge, and, susceptible of all the energies of genius. She found a melancholy pleasure in listening to the soft tones of Clara's lute, and would often soothe her mind by attempting to repeat the airs she heard.</P>
<P>The gentleness of her manners, partaking so much of that pensive character which marked La Luc's, was soothing to his heart, and tinctured his behaviour with a degree of tenderness that imparted comfort to her, and gradually won her entire confidence and affection. She saw with extreme concern the declining state of his health, and united her efforts with those of the family to amuse and revive him.</P>
<P>The pleasing society of which she partook, and the quietness of the country, at length restored her mind to a state of to∣lerable composure. She was now acquainted with all the wild walks of the neighbouring mountains, and, never tired of viewing their astonishing scenery, she often indulged herself in traversing alone their unfrequented paths, where now and then a peasant from a neigh∣bouring
<PB N="161" REF="160"/>
village was all that interrupted the profound solitude. She generally took with her a book, that if she perceived her thoughts inclined to fix on the one object of her grief, she might force them to a subject less danger∣ous to her peace. She had become a tolerable proficient in English while at the convent where she received her education, and the instruction of La Luc, who was well ac∣quainted with the language, now served to her. He was partial to the English; he admired their character, and the consti∣tution of their laws, and his library contained a collection of their best authors, particularly of their philosophers and poets. Adeline found that no species of writing had power so effectually to withdraw her mind from the contemplation of its own misery, as the higher kinds of poetry, and in these her taste soon taught her to distinguish the supe∣riority of the English from that of the French. The genius of the language, more perhaps than the genius of the people, if indeed the distinction may be allowed, occasioned this.</P>
<P>She frequently took a volume of Shake∣spear or Milton, and, having gained some wild eminence, would seat herself benea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h the pines, whose low murmurs soothed her heart, and conspired with the visions of the poet to lull her to forgetfulness of grief.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="161"/>
One evening, when Clara was en∣gaged at home, Adeline wandered alone to a favourite spot among the rocks that bordered the lake. It was an eminence which commanded an entire view of the lake, and of the stupendous mountains that environed it. A few ragged thorns grew from the precipice beneath, which descended perpendicularly to the water's edge; and above rose a thick wood of larch, pine, and fir, intermingled with some chesnut and mountain ash. The evening was fine, and the air so still, that it scarcely waved the light leaves of the trees around, or rimpled the broad expanse of the waters below. Adeline gazed on the scene with a kind of still rapture, and watched the sun sinking amid a crimson glow, which tinted the bosom of the lake and the snowy heads of the distant alps. The delight which the scenery inspired,
<Q><L>"Soothing each gust of passion into peace,</L>
<L>"All but the swellings of the soften'd heart,</L>
<L>"That waken, not disturb, the tranquil mind!"</L></Q>
was now heightened by the tones of a French horn, and, looking on the lake, she perceived at some distance a pleasure boat. As it was a spectacle rather un∣common in this solitude, she concluded
<PB N="163" REF="162"/>
the boat contained a party of foreigners come to view the wonderful scenery of the country, or perhaps of Genevois who chose to amuse themselves on a lake as grand, though much less extensive than their own; and the latter conjecture was probably just.</P>
<P>As she listened to the mellow and en∣chanting tones of the horn, which gra∣dually sunk away in distance, the scene appeared more lovely than before, and finding it impossible to forbear attempt∣ing to paint in language what was so beautiful in reality, she composed the following
<Q><LG TYPE="poem">

<L>How smooth that lake expands its ample breast!</L>

</LG></Q></P>
<P>La Luc observing how much Adeline was charmed with the features of the country, and desirous of amusing her melancholy, which, notwithstanding her efforts, was often too apparent, wished to shew her other scenes than those to which her walks was circumscribed. He proposed a party on horseback to take a nearer view of the Glaciers; to attempt their ascent was a difficulty and fatigue to which neither La Luc, in his present state of health, nor Adeline, were equal. She had not been accustomed to ride
<PB N="165" REF="164"/>
single, and the mountainous road they were to pass made the experiment rather dangerous; but she concealed her fears, and they were not sufficient to make her wish to forego an enjoyment such as was now offered her.</P>
<P>The following day was fixed for this excursion. La Luc and his party arose at an early hour, and having taken a slight breakfast, they set out towards the Glacier of Montanvert, which lay at a few leagues distance. Peter carried a small basket of provisions; and it was their plan to dine on some pleasant spot in the open air.</P>
<P>It is unnecessary to describe the high enthusiasm of Adeline, the more com∣placent pleasure of La Luc, and the trans∣ports of Clara, as the scenes of this romantic country shifted to their eyes. Now frowning in dark and gloomy grandeur, it exhibited only tremendous rocks, and cataracts rolling from the heights into some deep and narrow valley, along which their united waters roared and foamed, and burst away to regions inaccessible to mortal foot: and now the scene arose less fiercely wild;
<Q><L>"The pomp of groves and garniture of field's</L></Q>
were intermingled with the ruder features of nature, and while the snow froze on the
<PB N="166" REF="165"/>
summit of the mountain, the vine blushed at its foot.</P>
<P>Engaged in interesting conversation, and by the admiration which the country excited, they travelled on till noon, when they looked round for a pleasant spot where they might rest and take refreshment. At some little distance they perceived the ruins of a fabric which had once been a castle; it stood almost on a point of rock that overhung a deep valley; and its broken turrets rising from among the woods that embosomed it, heightened the picturesque beauty of the object.</P>
<P>The edifice invited curiosity, and the shades repose—La Luc and his party advanced.
<Q><L>"Deep struck with awe, they mark'd the dome o'erthrown,</L>
<L>"Where once the beauty bloom'd, the warrior shone:</L>
<L>"They saw the <HI>castle</HI>'s mould'ring towers decay'd,</L>
<L>"The loose stone tott'ring o'er the trembling shade."</L></Q></P>
<P>They seated themselves on the grass under the shade of some high trees near the ruins. An opening in the woods afforded a view of the distant alps—the deep silence of solitude reigned. For some time they were lost in meditation. Adeline felt a sweet complacency, such as she had long been a stranger to. Looking at La Luc, she perceived a tear
<PB N="167" REF="166"/>
stealing down his cheek, while the eleva∣tion of his mind was strongly expressed on his countenance. He turned on Clara his eyes, which were now filled with tenderness, and made an effort to recover himself.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The stillness and total seclusion of this scene,"</Q> said Adeline, <Q REND="inline">"those stu∣pendous mountains, the gloomy gran∣deur of these woods, together with that monument of faded glory on which the hand of time is so emphatically impressed, diffuse a sacred enthusiasm over the mind, and awaken sensations truly sublime."</Q></P>
<P>La Luc was going to speak; but Peter coming forward, desired to know whe∣ther he had not better open the wallet, as he fancied his honour and the young ladies must be main hungry, jogging on so far up hill and down before dinner. They acknowledged the truth of honest Peter's suspicion, and accepted his hint.</P>
<P>Refreshments were spread on the grass, and having seated themselves under the canopy of waving woods, surrounded by the sweets of wild flowers, they inhaled the pure breeze of the alps, which might be called spirit of air, and partook of a repast which these circumstances rendered delicious.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="167"/>
When they arose to depart, <Q REND="inline">"I am un∣willing,"</Q> said Clara, <Q REND="inline">"to quit this char∣ming spot. How delightful would it be to pass one's life beneath these shades with the friends who are dear to one!"—</Q>La Luc smiled at the romantic simplicity of the idea; but Adeline sighed deeply to the image of felicity, and of Theodore, which it recalled, and turned away to conceal her tears.</P>
<P>They now mounted their horses, and soon after arrived at the foot of Montanvert. The emotions of Adeline, as she contemplated in various points of view the astonishing objects around her, surpassed all expression; and the feelings of the whole party were too strong to admit of conversation. The profound stillness which reigned in these regions of solitude inspired awe, and heigh∣tened the sublimity of the scenery to an ex∣quisite degree</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"It seems,"</Q> said Adeline, <Q REND="inline">"as if we were walking over the ruins of the world, and were the only persons who had survived the wreck. I can scarcely persuade myself that we are not left alone on the globe."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The view of these objects,"</Q> said La Luc, <Q REND="inline">"lift the soul to their Great Author, and we contemplate with a feeling almost too vast for humanity—the sublimity of his nature in the grandeur of his works."—</Q>La Luc rais∣ed his eyes, filled with tears, to heaven,
<PB N="169" REF="168"/>
and was for some moments lost in silent adoration.</P>
<P>They quitted these scenes with extreme reluctance; but the hour of the day, and the appearance of the clouds, which seemed gathering for a storm, made them hasten their departure. Could she have been sheltered from its fury, Adeline almost wished to have witnessed the tremendous effect of a thunder storm in these regions.</P>
<P>They returned to Leloncourt by a different route, and the shade of the overhanging precipices was deepened by the gloom of the atmosphere. It was evening when they came within view of the lake, which the travellers rejoiced to see, for the storm so long threatened was now fast approaching; the thunder murmured among the alps; and the dark vapours that rolled heavily along their sides heightened their dreadful sublimity. La Luc would have quick∣ened his pace, but the road winding down the steep side of a mountain made caution necessary. The darkening air and the lightnings that now flashed along the horizon terrified Clara, but she withheld the expression of her fear in consideration of her father. A peal of thunder, which seemed to shake the earth to its founda∣tions, and was reverberated in tremendous echoes from the cliffs, burst over their heads.
<PB N="170" REF="169"/>
Clara's horse took fright at the sound, and, setting off, hurried her with amazing velocity down the mountain towards the lake, which washed its foot. The agony of La Luc, who viewed her progress in the horrible expectation of seeing her dashed down the precipice that bordered the road, is not to be described.</P>
<P>Clara kept her seat, but terror had al∣most deprived her of sense. He efforts to preserve herself were mechanical, for she scarce∣ly knew what she did. The horse, however, carried her safely almost to the foot of the mountain, but was making towards the lake, when a gentleman who travelled along the road caught the bridle as the animal endea∣voured to pass. The sudden stopping of the horse threw Clara to the ground, and, impatient of restraint, the animal burst from the hand of the stranger, and plunged into the lake. The violence of the fall deprived her of recollection; but while the stranger endeavoured to support her, his servant ran to fetch water.</P>
<P>She soon recovered, and unclosing her eyes, found herself in the arms of a che∣valier, who appeared to support her with difficulty. The compassion expressed in his countenance, while he inquired how she did, revived her spirits, and she was en∣deavouring to thank him for his kindness
<PB N="171" REF="170"/>
when La Luc and Adeline came up. The terror impressed on her father's features was perceived by Clara; languid as she was, she tried to raise herself, and said, with a faint smile, which betrayed, instead of disgusing her sufferings, <Q REND="inline">"Dear Sir, I am not hurt."</Q> Her pale countenance and the blood that trickled down her cheek contradicted her words. But La Luc, to whom terror had suggested the utmost possible evil, now re∣joiced to hear her speak; he recalled some presence of mind, and while Adeline applied her salts, he chased her temples.</P>
<P>When she revived she told him how much she was obliged to the stranger. La Luc endeavoured to express his gratitude; but the former interrupting him, begged he might be spared the pain of receiving thanks for having followed only an impulse of com∣mon humanity.</P>
<P>They were now not far from Leloncourt; but the evening was almost shut in, and the thunder murmured deeply among the hills. La Luc was distressed how to convey Clara home.</P>
<P>In endeavouring to raise her from the ground, the stranger betrayed such evident symptoms of pain, that La Luc inquired concerning it. The sudden jerk which the horse had given the arm of the chevalier, in escaping from his hold, had violently
<PB N="172" REF="171"/>
sprained his shoulder, and rendered his arm almost useless. The pain was exquisite, and La Luc, whose fears for his daughter were now subsiding, was shocked at the circum∣stance, and pressed the stranger to accom∣pany him to the village, where relief might be obtained. He accepted the invitation, and Clara, being at length placed on a horse led by her father, was conducted to the cha∣teau.</P>
<P>When Madame, who had been looking out for La Luc some time, perceived the cavalcade approaching, she was alarmed, and her apprehensions were confirmed when she saw the situation of her niece. Clara was carried into the house, and La Luc would have sent for a surgeon, but there was none within several leagues of the village, neither were there any of the physical pro∣fession within the same distance. Clara was assisted to her chamber by Adeline, and Ma∣dame La Luc undertook to examine the wounds. The result restored peace to the family; for though she was much bruised, she had escaped material injury; a slight contusion on the forehead had occasioned the bloodshed which at first alarmed La Luc. Madame undertook to restore her niece in a few days with the assistance of a balsam com∣posed by herself, on the virtues of which she descanted with great eloquence, till La Luc
<PB N="173" REF="172"/>
interrupted her by reminding her of the condition of her patient.</P>
<P>Madame having bathed Clara's bruises, and given her a cordial of incomparable efficacy, left her, and Adeline watched in the chamber of her friend till she retired to her own for the night.</P>
<P>La Luc, whose spirits had suffered much perturbation, was now tranquillized by the report his sister made of Clara. He intro∣duced the stranger, and having mentioned the accident he had met with, desired that he might have immediate assistance. Ma∣dame hastened to her closet, and it is per∣haps difficulty to determine whether she felt most concern for the sufferings of her guest, or pleasure at the opportunity thus of∣fered of displaying her physical skill. How∣ever this might be, she quitted the room with great alacrity, and very quickly re∣turned with a phial containing her inestima∣ble balsam, and having given the necessary directions for the application of it, she left the stranger to the care of his servant.</P>
<P>La Luc insisted that the chevalier, M. Verneuil, should not leave the chateau that night, and he very readily submitted to be detained. His manners during the evening were as frank and engaging as the hospita∣lity and gratitude of La Luc were sincere, and they soon entered into interesting con∣versation.
<PB N="174" REF="173"/>
M. Verneuil conversed like a man who had seen much, and thought more, and if he discovered any prejudice in his opinions, it was evidently the prejudice of a mind which, seeing objects through the medium of its own goodness, tinges them with the hue of its predominant quality. La Luc was much pleased, for in his retired situation he had not often an opportunity of receiving the pleasure which results from a communion of intelligent minds. He found that M. Verneuil had travelled. La Luc having asked some questions relative to Eng∣land, they fell into discourse concerning the national characters of the French and Eng∣lish.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"If it is the privilege of wisdom,"</Q> said M. Verneuil, <Q REND="inline">"to look beyond happiness, I own I had rather be without it. When we observe the English, their laws, writ∣ings, and conversation, and at the same time mark their countenances, manners, and the frequency of suicide among them, we are apt to believe that wisdom and happiness are incompatible. If, on the other hand, we turn to their neighbours, the French, and see <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It must be remembered that this was said in the se∣venteenth century.</NOTE> their wretched po∣licy, their sparkling, but sophistical dis∣course,
<PB N="175" REF="174"/>
frivolous occupations, and, with∣al, their gay animated air, we shall be compelled to acknowledge that happiness and folly too often dwell together."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"It is the end of wisdom,"</Q> said La Luc, <Q REND="inline">"to attain happiness, and I can hardly dig∣nify that conduct or course of thinking which tends to misery with the name of wisdom. By this rule, perhaps, the fol∣ly, as we term it, of the French deserves, since its effect is happiness, to be called wisdom. That airy thoughtlessness, which seems alike to contemn reflection and anticipation, produces all the effect of it without reducing its subjects to the mortification of philosophy. But in truth wisdom is an exertion of mind to subdue folly; and as the happiness of the French is less the consequence of mind than of constitution, it deserves not the honours of wisdom."</Q></P>
<P>Discoursing on the variety of opinions that are daily formed on the same conduct, La Luc observed how much that which is commonly called opinion is the result of passion and temper.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"True,"</Q> said M. Verneuil, <Q REND="inline">"there is a tone of thought, as there is a key note in music, that leads all its weaker affections. Thus where the powers of judging may be equal, the disposition to
<PB N="176" REF="175"/>
judge is different, and the actions of men are at least but too often arraigned by whim and caprice, by partial vanity and the humour of the moment."</Q></P>
<P>Here La Luc took occasion to reprobate the conduct of those writers, who, by shew∣ing the dark side only of human nature, and by dwelling on the evils only which are incident to humanity, have sought to de∣grade man in his own eyes, and to make him discontented with life. <Q REND="inline">"What should we say of a painter,"</Q> continued La Luc, <Q REND="inline">"who collected in his piece objects of a black hue only, who presented you with a black man, a black horse, a black dog, &amp;c. &amp;c., and tells you that his is a pic∣ture of nature, and that nature is black?"—"'Tis true, you would reply, "the ob∣jects you exhibit do exist in nature, but they form a very small part of her works. You say that nature is black, and, to prove it, you have collected on your canvass all the animals of this hue that exist. But you have forgot to paint the green earth, the blue sky, the white man, and objects of all those various hues with which creation abounds, and of which black is a very inconsiderable part."</Q></P>
<P>The countenance of M. Verneuil ligh∣tened with peculiar animation during the
<PB N="177" REF="176"/>
discourse of La Luc.—<Q REND="inline">"To think well of his nature,"</Q> said he, <Q REND="inline">"is necessary to the dignity and the happiness of man. There is a decent pride which becomes every mind, and is congenial to virtue. That consciousness of innate dignity, which shews him the glory of his nature, will be his best protection from the meanness of vice. Where this consciousness is wanting,"</Q> continued M. Verneuil, <Q REND="inline">"there can be no sense of moral honour, and consequently none of the higher prin∣ples of action. What can be expected of him who says it is his nature to be mean and selfish? Or who can doubt that he who thinks thus, thinks from the ex∣perience of his own heart, from the ten∣dency of his own inclinations? Let it always be remembered, that he who would persuade men to be good, ought to shew them that they are great."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"You speak,"</Q> said La Luc, <Q REND="inline">"with the honest enthusiasm of a virtuous mind; and in obeying the impulse of your heart, you utter the truths of philosophy: and, trust me, a bad heart and a <HI>truly</HI> phi∣losophic head has never yet been united in the same individual. Vicious inclinati∣ons not only corrupt the heart, but the understanding, and thus lead to false rea∣soning.
<PB N="178" REF="177"/>
Virtue only is on the side of truth."</Q></P>
<P>La Luc and his guest, mutually pleased with each other, entered upon the discus∣sion of subjects so interesting to them both, that it was late before they parted for the night.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>REPOSE had so much restored Clara, that when Adeline, anxious to know how she did, went early in the morning to her chamber, she found her already risen, and ready to attend the family at breakfast∣Monsieur Verneuil appeared also, but his looks betrayed a want of rest, and indeed he had suffered during the night a degree of anguish from his arm, which it was an effort
<PB N="179" REF="178"/>
of some resolution to endure in silence. It was now swelled and somewhat inflamed, and this might in some degree be attributed to the effect of Madam La Luc's balsam, whose restorative qualities had for once failed. The whole family sympathised with his sufferings, and Madame, at the request of M. Verneuil, abandoned her balsam, and substituted an emollient fomentation.</P>
<P>From an application of this he, in a short time, found an abatement of the pain, and returned to the breakfast table with greater composure. The happiness which La Luc felt at seeing his daughter in safety was very apparent, but the warmth of his gratitude towards her preserver he found it difficult to express. Clara spoke the genuine emotions of her heart with artless, but modest, energy, and testified sincere concern for the sufferings which she had occasioned M. Verneuil.</P>
<P>The pleasure received from the company of his guest, and the consideration of the essen∣tial services he had rendered him, co operated with the natural hospitality of La Luc, and he pressed M. Verneuil to remain some time at the chateau—<Q REND="inline">"I can never repay the services you have done me,"</Q> said La Luc; <Q REND="inline">"yet I seek to encrease my obligations to you by requesting you will prolong your visit, and thus allow me an opportunity of cultivating your acquaintance."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="179"/>
M. Verneuil, who at the time he met La Luc was travelling from Geneva to a distant part of Savoy, merely for the purpose of viewing thecountry, being now delighted with his host and with every thing around him, willingly accepted the invitation. In this circumstance prudence concurred with inclination, for to have pursued his journey on horseback, in his present situation, would have been danger∣ous, if not impracticable.</P>
<P>The morning was spent in conversation, in which M. Verneuil displayed a mind enriched with taste, enlightned by science and enlarged by observation. The situation of the chateau and the features of the sur∣rounding scenery charmed him, and in the eve∣ning he found himself able to walk with La Luc and explore the beauties of this romantic region. As they passed through the village, the salutations of the peasants, in whom love and respect were equally blended, and their eager inquiries after Clara, bore testimony to the character of La Luc, while his countenance expressed a serene satisfaction, arising from the con∣sciousness of deserving and possessing their love.—<Q REND="inline">"I live surrounded by my children,"</Q> said he, turning to M. Verneuil, who had no∣ticed their eagerness, <Q REND="inline">"for such I consider my parishioners. In discharging the duties of my office, I am repaid not only by my own conscience, but by their gratitude. There
<PB N="181" REF="180"/>
is a luxury in observing their simple and honest love, which I would not exchange for any thing the world calls blessings."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yet the world, Sir, would call the pleasures of which you speak romantic,"</Q> said M. Verneuil; <Q REND="inline">"for to be sensible of this pure and exquisite delight exquires a heart untainted with the vicious pleasures of society—pleasures that deaden its finest feelings and poison the scource of its truest enjoyments."—</Q>They pursued their way along the borders of the lake, sometimes under the shade of hanging woods, and sometimes over hillocks of turf, where the scene opened in all its wild magnificence. M. Verneuil often stoped in raptures to observe and point out the singular beauties it exhibited, while La Luc, pleased with the delight his friend expressed, surveyed with more than usual satisfaction the objects which had so often charmed him before. But there was a tender melancholy in the tone of his voice and his countenance, which arose from the recollection of having often traced those scenes, and partook of the pleasure they inspired, with her who had long since bade them an eternal farewell.</P>
<P>They presently quitted the lake, and, winding up a steep ascent between the woods, came after an hour's walk, to a green sum∣mit, which appeared, among the savage rocks that invironed it, like the blossom on the
<PB N="182" REF="181"/>
thorn. It was a spot formed for solitary de∣light, inspiring that soothing tenderness so dear to the feeling mind, and which calls back to memory the images of passed regret, softened by distance and endeared by frequent recollection. Wild shrubs grew from the crevices of the rocks beneath, and the high trees of pine and cedar that waved above afforded a melancholy and romantic shade. The silence of the scene was interrupted only by the breeze as it rolled over the woods, and by the solitary notes of the birds that inhabited the cliffs.</P>
<P>From this point the eye commanded an entire view of those majestic and sublime alps whose aspect fills the soul with emotions of indescribable awe, and seems to lift it to a nobler nature. The village, and the chateau of La Luc appeared in the bosom of the mountains, a peaceful retreat from the storms that gathered on their tops. All the faculties of M. Verneuil were absorbed in admiration, and he was for some time quite silent; at length, bursting into a rhapsody, he turned, and would have addressed La Luc, when he perceived him at a distance leaning against a rustick urn, over which drooped, in beau∣tiful luxuriance, the weeping willow.</P>
<P>As he approached, La Luc quitted his po∣sition, and advanced to meet him, while M. Verneuil inquired upon what occasion the
<PB N="183" REF="182"/>
urn had been erected. La Luc, unable to answer, pointed to it, and walked silently away, and M. Verneuil, approaching the urn, read the following inscription.
<Q>TO<LB/>THE MEMORY OF CLARA LA LUC.<LB/>THIS URN<LB/>IS ERECTED ON THE SPOT WHICH SHE LOVED,<LB/>IN TESTIMONY OF THE AFFECTION OF<LB/>A HUSBAND.</Q></P>
<P>M. Verneuil now comprehended the whole, and, feeling for his friend, was hurt that he had noticed this monument of his grief. He rejoined La Luc, who was standing on the point of the eminence contemplating the landscape below with an air more placid, and touched with the sweet∣ness of piety and resignation. He perceived that M. Verneuil was some what disconcert∣ed, and he sought to remove his uneasiness. <Q REND="inline">"You will consider it,"</Q> said he, <Q REND="inline">"as a mark of my esteem that I have brought you to this spot. It is never prophaned by the presence of the unfeeling. They would deride the faithfulness of an attach∣ment which has so long survived its ob∣jects, and which, in their own breasts, would quickly have been lost amidst the
<PB N="184" REF="183"/>
dissipation of general society. I have cherished in my heart the remembrance of a woman whose virtues claimed all my love: I have cherished it as a treasure to which I could withdraw from temporary cares and vexations, in the certainty of finding a soothing, though melancholy, comfort."</Q></P>
<P>La Luc paused. M. Verneuil expressed the sympathy he felt, but he knew the sa∣credness of sorrow, and soon relapsed into si∣lence. <Q REND="inline">"One of the brightest hopes of a future state,"</Q> resumed La Luc, <Q REND="inline">"is, that we shall meet again those whom we have loved upon earth. And perhaps our hap∣piness may be permitted to consist very much in the society of our friends, purified from the frailties of mortality, with the finer affections more sweetly attuned, and with the faculties of mind infinitely more elevated and enlarged. We shall then be enabled to comprehend subjects which are too vast for human conception; to com∣prehend, perhaps, the sublimity of that Deity who first called us into being. These views of futurity, my friend, elevate us above the evils of this world, and seem to communicate to us a portion of the nature we contemplate"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Call them not the illusions of a vision∣ary brain,"</Q> proceeded La Luc: <Q REND="inline">"I trust
<PB N="185" REF="184"/>
in their reality. Of this I am certain, that whether they are illusions or not, a faith in them ought to be cherished for the com∣fort it brings to the heart, and reverenced for the dignity it imparts to the mind. Such feelings make a happy and an impor∣tant part of our belief in a future existence: they give energy to virtue, and stability to principle."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"This,"</Q> said M Verneuil, <Q REND="inline">"is what I have often felt, and what every ingenuous mind must acknowledge."</Q></P>
<P>La Luc and M. Verneuil continued in conversation till the sun had left the scene. The mountains, darkened by twilight, as∣sumed a sublimer aspect, while the tops of some of the highest alps were yet illuminated by the sun's rays, and formed a striking con∣trast to the shadowy obscurity of the world below. As they descended through the woods, and traversed the margin of the lake, the stillness and solemnity of the hour diffused a pensive sweetness over their minds, and sunk them into silence.</P>
<P>They found supper spread, as was usual, in the hall, of which the windows open∣ed upon a garden, where the flowers might be said to yield their fragrance in gratitude to the refreshing dews. The windows were embowered with eglantine and other sweet shrubs, which hung in
<PB N="186" REF="185"/>
wild luxuriance around, and formed a beautiful and simple decoration. Clara and Adeline loved to pass the evenings in this hall, where they had acquired the first rudi∣ments of astronomy, and from which they had a wide view of the heavens. La Luc pointed out to them the planets and the fixed stars, explained their laws, and from thence taking occasion to mingle moral with scien∣tific instruction, would often ascend to∣wards that great first cause, whose nature soars beyond the grasp of human compre∣hension.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No study,"</Q> he would sometimes say, <Q REND="inline">"so much enlarges the mind, or impresses it with so sublime an idea of the Deity, as that of astronomy. When the imaginati∣on launches into the regions of space, and contemplates the innumerable worlds which are scattered through it, we are lost in astonishment and awe. This globe ap∣appears as a mass of atoms in the im∣mensity of the universe, and man a mere insect. Yet how wonderful! that man, whose frame is so diminutive in the scale of being, should have powers which spurn the narrow boundaries of time and place, soar beyond the sphere of his existence, penetrate the secret laws of nature, and calculate their progressive effects."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Oh! how expressively does this prove
<PB N="187" REF="186"/>
the spirituality of our Being! Let the ma∣terialist consider it, and blush that he has ever doubted."</Q></P>
<P>In this hall the whole family now met at supper, and during the remainder of the evening the conversation turned upon general subjects, in which Clara joined in modest and judicious remark. La Luc had taught her to familiarize her mind to reasoning, and had accustomed her to deliver her sentiments freely<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> she spoke them with a simplicity extremely engag∣ing, and which convinced her hearers that the love of knowledge, not the va∣nity of talking, induced her to converse. M. Verneuil evidently endeavoured to draw forth her sentiments, and Clara, in∣terested by the subjects he introduced, a stranger to affectation, and pleased with the opinions he expressed, answered them with frankness and animation. They re∣tired mutually pleased with each other.</P>
<P>M. Verneuil was about six and thirty; his figure manly, his countenance frank and engaging. A quick penetrating eye, whose fire was softened by benevolence, disclosed the chief traits of his character; he was quick to discern, but generous to excuse, the follies of mankind; and while no one more sensibly felt an injury, none
<PB N="188" REF="187"/>
more readily accepted the concession of an enemy.</P>
<P>He was by birth a Frenchman. A fortune lately devolved to him, had en∣abled him to execute the plan, which his active and inquisitive mind had sug∣gested, of viewing the most remarkable parts of the continent. He was pecu∣liarly susceptible of the beautiful and sub∣lime in nature To such a taste Switzer∣land and the adjacent country was, of all others, the most interesting; and he found the scenery it exhibited infinitely surpas∣sing all that his glowing imagination had painted; he saw with the eye of a painter, and felt with the rapture of a poet.</P>
<P>In the habitation of La Luc he met with the hospitality, the frankness, and the simplicity, so characteristic of the country: in his venerable host he saw the strength of philosophy united with the finest tenderness of humanity—a phi∣losophy which taught him to correct his feelings, not to annihilate them; in Clara, the bloom of beauty, with the most perfect simplicity of heart; and in Ade∣line all the charms of elegance and grace, with a genius deserving of the highest cul∣ture. In this family picture the goodness of Madame La Luc was not unperceived or forgotten. The chearfulness and harmony
<PB N="189" REF="188"/>
that reigned within the chateau was de∣lightful; but the philanthropy which, flow∣ing from the heart of the pastor, was diffused through the whole village, and united the inhabitants in the sweet and firm bonds of social compact, was divine. The beauty of its situation conspired with these circum∣stances to make Leloncourt seem almost a Paradise. M. Verneuil sighed that he must so soon quit it. <Q REND="inline">"I ought to seek no farther,"</Q> said he, <Q REND="inline">"for here wis∣wisdom and happiness dwell together."</Q></P>
<P>The admiration was reciprocal; La Luc and his family found themselves much interested in M. Verneuil, and looked forward to the time of his depar∣ture with regret. So warmly they pres∣sed him to prolong his visit, and so pow∣erfully his own inclinations seconded theirs, that he accepted the invitation. La Luc omitted no circumstance which might con∣tribute to the amusement of his guest, who, having in a few days recovered the use of his arm, they made several excursions among the mountains. Adeline and Clara, whom the care of Madame had restored to her usual health, were generally of the party.</P>
<P>After spending a week at the chateau, M. Verneuil bade adieu to La Luc and his family; they parted with mutual regret, and the former promised that when
<PB N="190" REF="189"/>
he returned to Geneva, he would take Leloncourt in his way. As he said this, Adeline, who had for some time observed, with much alarm, La Luc's declining health, looked mournfully on his languid countenance, and uttered a secret prayer that he might live to receive the visit of M. Verneuil.</P>
<P>Madame was the only person who did not lament his departure, she saw that the efforts of her brother to entertain his guest were more than his present state of health would admit of, and she rejoiced in the quiet that would now return to him.</P>
<P>But this quiet brought La Luc no re∣spite from illness; the fatigue he had suffered in his late excursions seemed to have encreased his disorder, which in a short time assumed the aspect of a con∣sumption. Yielding to the solicitations of his family, he went to Geneva for ad∣vice, and was there recommended to try the air of Nice.</P>
<P>The journey thither, however, was of considerable length, and believing his life to be very precarious, he hesitated whether to go. He was also unwilling to leave the duty of his parish unperformed for so long a period as his health might require; but this was an objection which would not have with∣held him from Nice, had his faith in the
<PB N="191" REF="190"/>
climate been equal to that of his physi∣cians.</P>
<P>His parishioners felt the life of their pastor to be of the utmost consequence to them. It was a general cause, and they testified at once his worth, and their sense of it, by going in a body to solicit him to leave them. He was much affected by this instan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> of their attachment. Such a proof of regard, joined with the entreaties of his own family, and a consideration that for their sakes it was a duty to endeavour to prolong his life, was too powerful to be withstood, and he determined to set out for Italy.</P>
<P>It was settled that Clara and Adeline, whose health La Luc thought required change of air and scene, should accom∣pany him, attended by the faithful Peter.</P>
<P>On the morning of his departure, a large body of his parishioners assembled round the door to bid him farewell. It was an affect∣ing scene; they might meet no more. At length, wiping the tears from his eyes, La Luc said, <Q REND="inline">"Let us trust in God, my friends; he has power to heal all disorders both of body and mind. We shall meet again, if not in this world, I hope in a better. Let our conduct be such as to ensure that better."</Q></P>
<P>The sobs of his people prevented any reply. There was scarcely a dry eye in
<PB N="192" REF="191"/>
the village; for there was scarcely an inhabitant of it that was not now assem∣bled in the presence of La Luc. He shook hands with them all, <Q REND="inline">"Farewell, my friends,"</Q> said he, <Q REND="inline">"we shall meet again."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"God grant we may,"</Q> said they with one voice of fervent petition.</P>
<P>Having mounted his horse, and Clara and Adeline being ready, they took a last leave of Madame La Luc, and quitted the chateau. The people, unwilling to leave La Luc, the greater part of them accompanied him to some distance from the village. As he moved slowly on he cast a last lingering look at his little home, where he had spent so many peaceful years, and which he now gazed on, per∣haps for the last time, and tears rose to his eyes; but he checked them. Every scene of the adjacent country called up, as he passed, some tender remembrance. He looked towards the spot consecrated to the memory of his deceased wife; the dewy vapours of the morning veiled it. La Luc felt the disappointment more deep∣ly, perhaps, than reason could justify; but those who know from experience how much the imagination loves to dwell on any object, however remotely con∣nected with that of our tenderness, will feel with him. This was an object round
<PB N="193" REF="192"/>
which the affections of La Luc had settled themselves; it was a memorial to the eye, and the view of it awakened more forcibly in the memory every tender idea that could associate with the primary subject of his regard. In such cases fancy gives to the illusions of strong affection, the stamp of reality, and they are cherished by the heart with romantic fondness.</P>
<P>His people accompanied him for near a mile from the village, and could scarce∣ly then be prevailed on to leave him; at length he once more bade them farewell, and went on his way, followed by their prayers and blessings.</P>
<P>La Luc and his little party travelled slowly on, sunk in pensive silence—a si∣lence too pleasingly sad to be soon relin∣quished, and which they indulged with∣out fear of interruption. The solitary grandeur of the scenes through which they passed, and the soothing murmur of the pines that waved above, aided this soft luxury of meditation.</P>
<P>They proceeded by easy stages; and after travelling for some days among the romantic mountains and green vallies of Piedmont, they entered the rich coun∣ty of Nice. The gay and luxuriant views which now opened upon the travellers as they wound among the hills, appeared
<PB N="194" REF="193"/>
like scenes of fairy enchantment, or those produced by the lonely visions of the Poets. While the spiral summits of the mountains exhibited the snowy severity of winter, the pine, the cypress, the olive, and the myr∣tle shaded their sides with the green tints of spring, and groves of orange, lemon, and citron, spread over their feet the full glow of autumn. As they advanced the scenery became still more diversified; and at length, between the receding heights, Adeline caught a glimpse of the distant waters of the Mediterranean, fading into the blue and cloudless horizon. She had never till now seen the ocean; and this transient view of it roused her imagination, and made her watch impatiently for a nearer prospect.</P>
<P>It was towards the close of day when the travellers, winding round an abrupt projection of that range of Alps which crowns the amphitheatre that environs Nice, looked down upon the green hills that stretch to the shores, on the city, and its antient castle, and on the wide waters of the Medi∣terranean; with the mountains of Corsica in the farthest distance. Such a sweep of sea and land, so varied with the gay, the magnificent, and the awful, would have fixed any eye in admiration:—for Adeline and Clara novelty and enthusiasm added their charms to the prospect. The soft and
<PB N="195" REF="194"/>
salubrious air seemed to welcome La Luc to this smiling region, and the serene at∣mosphere to promise invariable summer. They at length descended upon the little plain where stands the city of Nice, and which was the most extensive piece of level ground they had passed since they entered the county. Here, in the bosom of the mountains, sheltered from the north and the east, where the western gales alone seemed to breathe, all the blooms of spring and the riches of autumn were united. Trees of myrtle bordered the road, which wound among groves of orange, lemon, and bergamot, whose delicious fragrance came to the sense mingled with the breath of roses and carnations that blossomed in their shade. The gently swelling hills that rose from the plain were covered with vines, and crowned with cypresses, olives and date trees; beyond, there appeared the sweep of lofty mountains whence the travellers had descended, and whence rose the little river Paglion, swoln by the snows that melt on their summits, and which, after meander∣ing through the plain, washes the walls of Nice, where it falls into the Mediterranean. In this blooming region Adeline observed that the countenances of the peasants, mea∣gre and discontented, formed a melancholy contrast to the face of the country, and she
<PB N="196" REF="195"/>
lamented again the effects of an arbitrary government, where the bounties of nature, which were designed for all, are monopoliz∣ed by a few, and the many are suffered to starve tantalized by surrounding plenty.</P>
<P>The city lost much of its enchantment on a nearer approach: its narrow streets and shabby houses but ill answered the ex∣pectation which a distant view of its ram∣parts and its harbour, gay with vessels seemed to authorise. The appearance of the inn at which La Luc now alighted did not contribute to soften his disappointment; but if he was surprised to find such indifferent accommodation at the inn of a town cele∣brated as the resort of valetudinarians, he was still more so when he learned the diffi∣culty of procuring furnished lodgings.</P>
<P>After much search he procured apartments in a small but pleasant house, situated a lit∣tle way out of the town: it had a garden, and a terrace which overlooked the sea, and was distinguished by an air of neatness very unusual in the houses of Nice. He agreed to board with the family, whose table like∣wise accommodated a gentleman and lady, their lodgers, and thus he became a tem∣porary inhabitant of this charming climate.</P>
<P>On the following morning Adeline rose at an early hour, eager to indulge the new and sublime emotion with which a view of
<PB N="197" REF="196"/>
the ocean inspired her, and walked with Clara toward the hills that afforded a more extensive prospect. They pursued their way for some time between high embowering banks, till they arrived at an eminence, whence
<Q><L>"Heaven, earth, ocean, smil'd!"</L></Q></P>
<P>They sat down on a point of rock, over∣shadowed by lofty palm-trees, to contem∣plate at leisure the magnificent scene. The sun was just emerged from the sea, over which his rays shed a flood of light, and darted a thousand brilliant tints on the va∣pours that ascended the horizon, and floated there in light clouds, leaving the bosom of the waters below clear as chrystal, except where the white surges were seen to beat upon the rocks; and discovering the dis∣tant sails of the fishing boats, and the far distant highlands of Corsica, tinted with aetherial blue. Clara, after some time, drew forth her pencil, but threw it aside in despair. Adeline, as they returned home through a romantic glen, when her senses were no longer absorbed in the contempla∣tion of this grand scenery, and when its images floated on her memory, only, in softened colours, repeated the following lines:
<Q><PB N="198" REF="197"/><LG TYPE="sonnet">
<HEAD>SUNRISE: A SONNET.</HEAD>
<L>Oft let me wander, at the break of day,</L>
<L>Thro' the cool vale o'erhung with waving woods;</L>
<L>Drink the rich fragrance of the budding May,</L>
<L>And catch the murmur of the distant floods;</L>
<L>Or rest on the fresh bank of limpid rill,</L>
<L>Where sleeps the vi'let in the dewy shade,</L>
<L>Where op'ning lilies balmy sweets distill,</L>
<L>And the wild musk-rose weeps along the glade:</L>
<L>Or climb the eastern cliff, whose airy head</L>
<L>Hangs rudely o'er the blue and misty main;</L>
<L>Watch the fine hues of morn through aether spread,</L>
<L>And paint with roseate glow the chrystal plain.</L>
<L>Oh! who can speak the rapture of the soul</L>
<L>When o'er the waves the sun first steals to sight,</L>
<L>And all the world of waters, as they roll,</L>
<L>And Heaven's vast vault unveils in living light!</L>
<L>So life's young hour to man enchanting smiles,</L>
<L>With sparkling health, and joy, and fancy's fairy wiles!</L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>La Luc in his walks met with some sen∣sible and agreeable companions, who like himself came to Nice in search of health. Of these he soon formed a small but pleasant society, among whom was a Frenchman, whose wild manners, marked with a deep and interesting melancholy, had particular∣ly attracted La Luc. He very seldom men∣tioned himself, or any circumstance that might lead to a knowledge of his family, but on other subjects conversed with frankness
<PB N="199" REF="198"/>
and much intelligence. La Luc had fre∣quently invited him to his lodgings, but he had always declined the invitation, and this in a manner so gentle as to disarm displea∣sure, and convince La Luc that his refu∣sal was the consequence of a certain dejec∣tion of mind which made him reluctant to meet other strangers.</P>
<P>The description which La Luc had given of this foreigner had excited the curiosity of Clara; and the sympathy which the un∣fortunate feel for each other called forth the commiseration of Adeline; for that he was unfortunate she could not doubt. On their return from an evening walk La Luc point∣ed out the chevalier, and quickened his pace to overtake him. Adeline was for a moment impelled to follow, but delicacy checked her steps, she knew how painful the presence of a stranger often is to a wounded mind, and forbore to intrude her∣self on his notice for the sake of only satis∣fying an idle curiosity. She turned there∣fore, into another path; but the delicacy which now prevented the meeting, acci∣dent in a few days defeated, and La Luc introduced the stranger. Adeline received him with a soft smile, but endeavoured to restrain the expression of pity which her features had involuntarily assumed; she wish∣ed
<PB N="200" REF="199"/>
him not to know that she observed he was unhappy.</P>
<P>After this interview he no longer rejected the invitations of La Luc, but made him frequent visits, and often accompanied Ade∣line and Clara in their rambles. The mild and sensible conversation of the former seem∣ed to soothe his mind, and in her presence he frequently conversed with a degree of ani∣mation which La Luc till then had not ob∣served in him. Adeline too derived from the similarity of their taste, and his in∣telligent conversation, a degree of satisfacti∣on which contributed, with the compassion his dejection inspired, to win her confi∣dence, and she conversed with an easy frankness rather unusual to her.</P>
<P>His visits soon became more frequent. He walked with La Luc and his family; he attended them on their little excursions to view those magnisicent remains of Ro∣man antiquity which enrich the neighbour∣hood of Nice. When the ladies sat at home and worked, he enlivened the hours by reading to them, and they had the pleasure to observe his spirits somewhat relieved from the heavy melancholy that had oppressed him.</P>
<P>M. Amand was passionately fond of music. Clara had not forgot to bring her beloved lute: he would sometimes strike the chords
<PB N="201" REF="200"/>
in the most sweet and mournful symphonies, but never could be prevailed on to play. When Adeline or Clara played, he would sit in deep reverie, and lost to every object around him, except when he fixed his eyes in mournful gaze on Adeline, and a sigh would sometimes escape him.</P>
<P>One evening Adeline having excused her∣self from accompanying La Luc and Clara in a visit to a neghbouring family, she re∣tired to the terrace of the garden, which overlooked the sea, and as she viewed the tranquil splendour of the setting sun, and his glories reflected on the polished surface of the waves, she touched the strings of the lute in softest harmony, her voice accom∣panying it with words which she had one day written after having read that rich ef∣fusion of Shakespeare's genius, "A Mid∣summer Night's Dream."

<P>Adeline ceased to sing—when she immedi∣ately heard repeated in a low voice,
<Q><L>"To mortal sprite such dulcet sound,</L>

and turning her eyes whence it came, she saw M. Amand. She blushed and laid down the lute, which he instantly took up, and with a tremulous hand drew forth tones
<Q><L>"That might create a soul under the ribs of Death."</L></Q>
In a melodious voice, that trembled with sensibility, he sang the following

<P>Monsieur Amand paused: he seemed much oppressed, and at length, bursting into tears, laid down the instrument and walked ab∣ruptly away to the farther end of the terrace. Adeline, without seeming to observe his agitation, rose and leaned upon the wall, below which a group of fishermen were busily employed in drawing a net. In a few moments he returned, with a composed and softened countenance. <Q REND="inline">"Forgive this abrupt conduct,"</Q> said he; <Q REND="inline">"I know not how to apologize for it but by owning its cause. When I tell you, Madam, that my tears flow to the memory of a lady who strongly resembled you, and who is lost to me for ever, you will know how to pity me."—</Q>His voice faultered, and he paused. Adeline was silent. <Q REND="inline">"The lute"</Q> he resumed, <Q REND="inline">"was her favourite instru∣ment, and when you touched it with such melancholy expression, I saw her very image before me. But alas! why do I distress you with a knowledge of my
<PB N="205" REF="204"/>
sorrows! she is gone, and never to return! And you, Adeline—you"—</Q>He checked his speech; and Adeline, turning on him a look of mournful regard, observed a wildness in his eyes which alarmed her. <Q REND="inline">"These recollections are too painful,"</Q> said she, <Q REND="inline">"in a gentle voice; let us return to the house; M La Luc is probably come home"—</Q><Q REND="inline">"O no!"</Q> replied M. Amand; <Q REND="inline">"No—this breeze refreshes me. How often at this hour have I talked with <HI>her,</HI> as I now talk with you!—Such were the soft tones of her voice—such the ineffable expression of her counte∣nance."—</Q>Adeline interrupted him. <Q REND="inline">"Let me beg of you to consider your health—this dewy air cannot be good for inva∣lids."</Q> He stood with his hands clasped, and seemed not to hear her. She took up the lute to go, and passed her fingers lightly over the chords. The sounds recalled his scatter∣ed senses: he raised his eyes, and fixed them in long unsettled gaze upon hers. <Q REND="inline">"Must I leave you here?"</Q> said she, smiling, and standing in an attitude to depart—<Q REND="inline">"I entreat you to play again the air I heard just now,"</Q> said M. Amand, in a hurried voice. <Q REND="inline">"Certainly;"</Q> and she immediately began to play. He leaned against a palm tree in an attitude of deep attention, and as the sounds languished on the air, his features gradually lost their wild expression, and he
<PB N="206" REF="205"/>
melted into tears. He continued to weep silently till the song concluded, and it was some time before he recovered voice enough to say, <Q REND="inline">"Adeline, I cannot thank you for this good∣ness. My mind has recovered its bias, you have soothed a broken heart. Increase the kindness you have shewn me by pro∣mising never to mention what you have witnessed this evening, and I will endeavour never again to wound your sensibility by a si∣milar offence."—</Q>Adeline gave the required promise; and M. Amand, pressing her hand, with a melancholy smile, hurried from the garden, and she saw him no more that night.</P>
<P>La Luc had been near a fortnight at Nice, and his health, instead of amending, seemed rather to decline, yet he wished to make a longer experiment of the climate. The air, which failed to restore her venerable friend, revived Adeline, and the variety and novelty of the surrounding scenes amused her mind, though, since they could not obliterate the memory of past, or suppress the pang of present affection, they were ineffectual to dissipate the sick languor of melancholy. Company, by compelling her to withdraw her attention from the subject of her sor∣row, afforded her a transient relief, but the violence of the exertion generally left her more depressed. It was in the stillness of solitude, in the tranquil observance of beau∣tiful
<PB N="207" REF="206"/>
nature, that her mind recovered its tone, and indulging the pensive inclination now become habitual to it, was soothed and fortified. Of all the grand objects which nature had exhibited, the ocean inspired her with the most sublime admiration. She loved to wander alone on its shores, and, when she could escape so long from the duties or the forms of society, she would sit for hours on the beach watching the rolling waves, and listening to their dying mur∣mur, till her softened fancy recalled long lost scenes, and restored the image of Theodore, when tears of despondency too often followed those of pity and regret. But these visions of memory, painful as they were, no longer excited that frenzy of grief they formerly awakened in Savoy; the sharpness of misery was passed, though its heavy influence was not perhaps less powerful. To these solitary indulgencies generally succeeded calmness, and what Adeline endeavoured to believe was resigna∣tion.</P>
<P>She usually rose early, and walked down to the shore to enjoy, in the cool and silent hours of the morning, the cheer∣ing beauty of nature, and inhale the pure sea-breeze. Every object then smiled in fresh and lively colours. The blue sea, the brilliant sky, the distant fishing boats,
<PB N="208" REF="207"/>
with their white sails, and the voices of the fishermen borne at intervals on the air, were circumstances which re-animated her spirits, and in one of her rambles, yielding to that taste for poetry which had seldom forsaken her, she repeated the follow∣ing lines.

<P>During several days succeeding that on which M. Amand had disclosed the cause of his melancholy, he did not visit La Luc. At length Adeline met him in one of her solitary rambles on the shore. He was pale and dejected, and seemed much agitated when he observed her; she there∣fore endeavoured to avoid him, but he ad∣vanced with quickened steps and accosted her. He said it was his intention to leave Nice in a few days. <Q REND="inline">"I have found no benefit from the climate,"</Q> added M. Amand; <Q REND="inline">"Alas! what climate can re∣lieve the sickness of the heart! I go to lose in the varieties of new scenes the re∣membrance of past happiness; yet the effort is vain; I am every where equally restless and unhappy."</Q> Adeline tried to encourage him to hope much from time and change of place. <Q REND="inline">"Time <HI>will</HI> blunt the sharpest edge of sorrow,"</Q> said she; <Q REND="inline">"I know it from experience."</Q> Yet while she spoke, the tears in her eyes contradicted the assertion of
<PB N="211" REF="210"/>
her lips. <Q REND="inline">"You have been unhappy, Adeline!—Yes—I knew it from the first. The smile of pity which you gave me, assured me that you knew what it was to suffer."</Q> The desponding air with which he spoke renewed her apprehension of a scene similar to the one she had lately wit∣nessed, and she changed the subject, but he soon returned to it. <Q REND="inline">"You bid me hope much from time!—My wife!—My dear wife!"—</Q>his tongue faultered—<Q REND="inline">"It is now many months since I lost her—yet the moment of her death seems but as yesterday."</Q> Adeline faintly smiled. <Q REND="inline">"You can scarcely judge of the effect of time yet, you have much to hope for."</Q> He shook his head. <Q REND="inline">"But I am again intruding my misfortunes on your notice; forgive this perpetual ego∣tism. There is a comfort in the pity of the good such as nothing else can impart; this must plead my excuse; may you, Adeline, never want it. Ah! those tears—"</Q> Adeline hastily dried them. M. Amand forbore to press the subject, and immediately began to converse on indifferent topics. They returned towards the chateau, but La Luc being from home, M. Amand took leave at the door. Adeline retired to her chamber, oppressed by her
<PB N="212" REF="211"/>
own sorrows and those of her amiable friend.</P>
<P>Near three weeks had now elapsed at Nice, during which the disorder of La Luc seemed rather to encrease than to abate, when his physician very honestly confessed the little hope he entertained from the climate, and advised him to try the effect of a sea voyage, adding, that if the experiment failed, even the air of Montpellier appeared to him more likely to afford relief than that of Nice. La Luc received this disinterested advice with a mixture of gratitude and disap∣pointment. The circumstances which had made him reluctant to quit Savoy, rendered him yet more so to protract his absence, and encrease his expences; but the ties of affection that bound him to his family, and the love of life, which so seldom leaves us, again prevailed over inferior considerations, and he determin∣ed to coast the Mediterranean as far as Lan∣guedoc, where, if the voyage did not an∣swer his expectations, he would land and proceed to Montpellier.</P>
<P>When M. Amand learned that La Luc designed to quit Nice in a few days, he de∣termined not to leave it before him. Dur∣ing this interval he had not sufficient re∣solution to deny himself the frequent con∣versation

of Adeline, though her presence, by reminding him of his lost wife, gave him more pain than comfort. He was the second son of a French gentleman of family, and had been married about a year to a lady to whom he had long been attached when she died in her lying-in. The infant soon followed its mother, and left the dis∣consolate father abandoned to grief, which had preyed so heavily on his health, that his physician thought it necessary to send him to Nice. From the air of Nice, however, he had derived no benefit, and he now determined to travel farther into Italy, though he no longer felt any interest in those charming scenes which in happier days, and with her whom he never ceased to lament, would have afforded him the highest degree of mental luxury—now he sought only to escape from himself, or rather from the image of her who had once constituted his truest happiness.</P>
<P>La Luc having laid his plan, hired a small vessel, and in a few days embarked, with a sick hope bidding adieu to the shores of Italy and the towering alps, and seeking on a new element the health which had hitherto mocked his pursuit.</P>
<P>M. Amand took a melancholy leave of his new friends, whom he attended to the sea side. When he assisted Adeline
<PB N="214" REF="213"/>
on board, his heart was too full to suffer him to say farewell; but he stood long on the beach pursuing with his eyes her course over the waters, and waving his hand, till tears dimmed his sight. The breeze wafted the vessel gently from the coast, and Adeline saw herself surround∣ed by the undulating waves of the ocean. The shore appeared to recede, its moun∣tains to lessen, the gay colours of its landscape to melt into each other, and in a short time the figure of M. Amand was seen no more: the town of Nice, with its castle and harbour, next faded away in dis∣tance, and the purple tint of the moun∣tains was at length all that remained on the verge of the horizon She sighed as she gazed, and her eyes filled with tears. <Q REND="inline">"So vanished my prospect of happi∣ness,"</Q> said she; <Q REND="inline">"and my future view is like the waste of waters that surround me."</Q> Her heart was full, and she retired from observation to a remote part of the deck, where she in∣dulged her tears as she watched the ves∣sel cut its way through the liquid glass. The water was so transparent that she saw the sun-beams playing at a conside∣rable depth, and fish of various colours glance athwart the current. Innumera∣ble marine plants spread their vigorous
<PB N="215" REF="214"/>
leaves on the rocks below, and the rich∣ness of their verdure formed a beautiful contrast to the glowing scarlet of the co∣ral that branched beside them.</P>
<P>The distant coast, at length, entirely disappeared. Adeline gazed with an emotion the most sublime, on the bound∣less expanse of waters that spread on all sides: she seemed as if launched into a new world; the grandeur and immen∣sity of the view astonished and over∣powered her: for a moment she doubted the truth of the compass, and believed it to be almost impossible for the vessel to find its way over the pathless waters to any shore. And when she considered that a plank alone separated her from death, a sensation of unmixed terror su∣perseded that of sublimity, and she has∣tily turned her eyes from the prospect, and her thoughts from the subject.</P>

<P>TOWARDS evening the captain, to avoid the danger of encountering a Bar∣bary corsair, steered for the French coast, and Adeline distinguished in the gleam of the setting sun the shores of Provence, feathered with wood and green with pas∣turage. La Luc, languid and ill, had retired to the cabin, whither Clara at∣tended him. The pilot at the helm, guiding the small vessel through the sound∣ing waters, and one solitary sailor, lean∣ing with crossed arms against the mast, and now and then singing parts of a mournful ditty, were all of the crew, except Adeline, that remained upon deck—and Adeline silently watched the de∣clining sun, which threw a saffron glow upon the waves, and on the sails, gently swelling in the breeze that was now dy∣ing away. The sun, at length, sunk below the ocean, and twilight stole over the scene, leaving the shadowy shores
<PB N="217" REF="216"/>
yet visible, and touching with a solemn tint the waters that stretched wide around. She sketched the picture, but it was with a saint pencil.
<Q><LG TYPE="poem">
<HEAD>NIGHT.</HEAD>
<L>O'er the dim breast of Ocean's wave</L>
<L>Night spreads afar her gloomy wings,</L>
<L>And pensive thought, and silence brings,</L>
<L>Save when the distant waters lave;</L>
<L>Or when the mariner's lone voice</L>
<L>Swells faintly in the passing gale,</L>
<L>Or when the screaming sea-gulls poise</L>
<L>O'er the tall mast and swelling sail.</L>
<L>Bounding the gray gleam of the deep,</L>
<L>Where fancy'd forms arouse the mind,</L>
<L>Dark sweep the shores, on whose rude steep</L>
<L>Sighs the sad spirit of the wind.</L>
<L>Sweet is its voice upon the air</L>
<L>At Ev'nings melancholy close,</L>
<L>While the smooth wave in silence flows!</L>
<L>Sweet, sweet the peace its stealing accents bear!</L>
<L>Blest be thy shades, O Night! and blest the song</L>
<L>Thy low winds breathe the distant shores along!</L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>As the shadows thickened the scene sunk into deeper repose. Even the sailor's song had ceased; no sound was heard but that of the waters dashing beneath the vessel, and their fainter murmur on the pebbly coast. Adeline's mind was in unison with the tranquility of the hour: lulled by the waves, she resigned herself to a still melancholy, and sat lost in reverie. The present moment brought to her recollection her voyage up the Rhone, when seeking refuge from the
<PB N="218" REF="217"/>
terrors of the Marquis de Montalt, she so anxiously endeavoured to anticipate her future destiny. She then, as now, had watched the fall of evening and the fading prospect, and she remembred what a desolate feeling had accompanied the impression which those objects made. She had then no friends—no asylum—no certainty of escaping the pursuit of her enemy. Now she had found affectionate friends—a secure retreat—and was delivered from the terrors she then suf∣fered—but still she was unhappy. The remembrance of Theodore—of Theodore who had loved her so truly, who had encountred and suffered so much for her sake, and of whose fate she was now as ignorant as when she traversed the Rhone, was an incessant pang to her heart. She seemed to be more remote than ever from the possibility of hear∣ing of him. Sometimes a faint hope crossed her that he had escaped the malice of his persecutor; but when she considered the inveteracy and power of the latter, and the heinous light in which the law regards an assault upon a superior officer, even this poor hope vanished, and left her to tears and an∣guish, such as this reverie, which began with a sensation of only gentle melancholy, now led to. She continued to muse till the moon arose from the bosom of the ocean, and shed her trembling lustre upon the waves,
<PB N="219" REF="218"/>
diffusing peace, and making silence more solemn; beaming a soft light on thewhite sails, and throwing upon the waters the tall shadow of the vessel, which now seemed to glide along unopposed by any current. Her tears had somewhat relieved the anguish of her mind, and she again reposed in placid me∣lancholy, when a strain of such tender and entrancing sweetness stole on the silence of the hour, that it seemed more like celestial than mortal musick—so soft, so soothing, it sunk upon her ear, that it recalled her from misery to hope and love. She wept again—but these were tears which she would not have exchanged for mirth and joy. She looked round, but perceived neither ship or boat; and as the undulating sounds swelled on the distant air, she thought they came from the shore. Sometimes the breeze wasted them away, and again returned them in tones of the most languishing softness. The links of the air thus broken, it was music rather than melody that she caught, till, the pilot gradually steering nearer the coast, she distin∣guished the notes of a song familiar to her ear. She endeavoured to recollect where she had heard it, but in vain; yet her heart beat almost unconsciously with a something re∣sembling hope. Still she listened, till the breeze again stole the sounds. With regret she now perceived that the vessel was moving
<PB N="220" REF="219"/>
from them, and at length they trembled faintly on the waves, sunk away at distance, and were heard no more. She remained upon the deck a considerable time, unwilling to relinquish the expectation of hearing them again, and their sweetness still vibrating on her fancy, and at length retired to the cabin oppressed by a degree of disappointment which the occasion did not appear to justify.</P>
<P>La Luc grew better during the voyage, his spirits revived, and when the vessel en∣tered that part of the Mediterranean called the Gulf of Lyons, he was sufficiently ani∣mated to enjoy from the deck the noble pros∣pect which the sweeping shores of Provence, terminating in the far distant ones of Lan∣guedoc, exhibited. Adeline and Clara, who anxiously watched his looks, rejoiced in their amendment; and the fond wishes of the latter already anticipated his perfect recovery. The expectations of Adeline had been too often checked by disappointment to permit her now to indulge an equal degree of hope with that of her friend, yet she consid∣ed much in the effect of this voyage.</P>
<P>La Luc amused himself at intervals with discoursing, and pointing out the situations of considerable ports on the coast, and the mouths of the rivers that, after wandering through Provence, disembogue themselves into the Mediterranean. The Rhone, how∣ever, was the only one of much consequence
<PB N="221" REF="220"/>
which he passed. On this object, though it was so distant that fancy, perhaps, rather than the sense, beheld it, Clara gazed with peculiar pleasure, for it came from the banks of Savoy; and the wave which she thought she perceived, had washed the feet of her dear native mountains. The time passed with mingled pleasure and improvement as La Luc described to his attentive pupils the manners and commerce of the different in∣habitants of the coast, and the natural history of the country; or as he traced in ima∣gination the remote wanderings of rivers to their source, and delineated the character∣istic beauties of their scenery.</P>
<P>After a pleasant voyage of a few days, the shores of Provence receded, and that of Lan∣guedoc, which had long bounded the distance, became the grand object of the scene, and the sailors drew near their port. They land∣ed in the afternoon at a small town situated at the foot of a woody eminence, on the right overlooking the sea, and on the left the rich plains of Languedoc, gay with the pur∣ple vine. La Luc determined to defer his journey till the following day, and was di∣rected to a small inn at the extremity of the town where the accomodation, such as it was, he endeavoured to be contented with.</P>
<P>In the evening the beauty of the hour, and the desire of exploring new scenes, invited
<PB N="222" REF="221"/>
Adeline to walk. La Luc was fatigued, and did not go out, and Clara remained with him. Adeline took her way to the woods that rose from the margin of the sea, and climbed the wild eminence on which they hung. Often as she went she turned her eyes to catch between the dark foliage the blue waters of the bay, the white sail that flitted by, and the trembling gleam of the setting sun. When she reached the sum∣mit, and looked down over the dark tops of the woods on the wide and various prospect, she was seized with a kind of still rapture im∣possible to be expressed, and stood unconsci∣ous of the flight of time, till the sun had left the scene, and twilight threw its solemn shade upon the mountains. The sea alone reflect∣ed the fading splendour of the West; its tran∣quil surface was partially disturbed by the low wind that crept in tremulous lines along the waters whence rising to the woods, it shivered their light leaves, and died away. Adeline resining herself to the luxury of sweet and tender emotions, repeated the following lines:
<Q><LG TYPE="poem">
<HEAD>SUNSET.</HEAD>
<L>Soft o'er the mountain's purple brow</L>
<L>Meek Twillight draws her shadows gray;</L>
<L>From tufted woods, and vallies low,</L>

<L><PB N="223" REF="222"/>
Yet still amid the spreading gloom,</L>
<L>Resplendent glow the western waves</L>
<L>That roll o'er Neptune's coral caves,</L>
<L>A zone of light on Ev'ning's dome.</L>
<L>On this lone summit let me rest,</L>
<L>And view the forms to Fancy dear</L>

<L>Or the moon's pale orb appear,</L>
<L>Throwing her line of radiance wide,</L>
<L>Far o'er the lightly-curling tide,</L>

<L>No sounds o'er silence now prevail,</L>
<L>Save of the dying wave below,</L>
<L>Or sailor's song borne on the gale,</L>
<L>Or oar at distance striking slow.</L>
<L>So sweet! so tranquil! may my ev'ning ray</L>
<L>Set to this world—and rise in future day!</L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>Adeline quitted the heights, and fol∣lowed a narrow path that wound to the beach below: her mind was now parti∣cularly sensible to fine impressions, and the sweet notes of the nightingale amid the stillness of the woods again awakened her enthusiasm.

<P><PB N="225" REF="224"/>
The spreading dusk at length remind∣ed Adeline of her distance from the inn, and that she had her way to find through a wild and lonely wood: she bade adieu to the syren that had so long detained her, and pursued the path with quick steps. Having followed it for some time, she became bewildered among the thickets, and the increasing darkness did not allow her to judge of the direction she was in. Her apprehensions heightened her difficulties: she thought she distinguished the voices of men at some little distance, and she in∣creased her speed till she found herself on the sea sands over which the woods impend∣ed. Her breath was now exhausted—she paused a moment to recover herself, and fearfully listened; but, instead of the voices of men, she heard faintly swelling in the breeze the notes of mournful music.—Her heart, ever sensible to the impres∣sions of melody, melted with the tones, and her fears were for a moment lulled in sweet enchantment. Surprise was soon mingled with delight when, as the sounds advanced, she distinguished the tone of that instrument, and the melody of that well-known air, she had heard a few preceding evenings from the shores of Provence. But she had no time for con∣jecture—footsteps approached, and she
<PB N="226" REF="225"/>
renewed her speed. She was now emerged from the darkness of the woods, and the moon, which shone bright, exhibited along the level sands the town and port in the distance. The steps that had followed now came up with her, and she perceived two men, but they passed in conversation without noticing her, and as they passed she was certain she recollected the voice of him who was then speaking. Its tones were so familiar to her ear, that she was surprised at the imperfect memory which did not suffer her to be assured by whom they were uttered. Another step now follow∣ed, and a rude voice called to her to stop. As she hastily turned her eyes she saw imperfectly by the moonlight a man in a sailor's habit pursuing, while he renewed the call. Impelled by terror, she fled along the sands, but her steps were short and trembling—those of her pursuer's strong and quick.</P>
<P>She had just strength sufficient to reach the men who had before passed her, and to implore their protection, when her pursuer came up with them, but sud∣denly turned into the woods on the left, and disappeared.</P>
<P>She had no breath to answer the in∣quiries of the strangers who supported her, till a sudden exclamation, and the
<PB N="227" REF="226"/>
sound of her own name, drew her eyes attentively upon the person who uttered them, and in the rays which shone strong upon his features, she distinguished M. Verneuil!—Mutual satisfaction and ex∣planation ensued, and when he learned that La Luc and his daughter were at the inn, he felt an increased pleasure in con∣ducting her thither. He said that he had accidentally met with an old friend in Savoy, whom he now introduced by the name of Mauron, and who had pre∣vailed on him to change his route and accompany him to the shores of the Me∣diterranean. They had embarked from the coast of Provence only a few prece∣ding days, and had that evening landed in Languedoc on the estate of M. Mau∣ron. Adeline had now no doubt that it was the flute of M. Verneuil, and which had so often delighted her at Leloncourt, that she had heard on the sea.</P>
<P>When they reached the inn they found La Luc under great anxiety for Adeline, in search of whom he had sent several people. Anxiety yielded to surprize and pleasure, when he perceived her with M. Verneuil, whose eyes beamed with unusual animation on seeing Clara. Af∣ter mutual congratulations, M. Verneuil
<PB N="228" REF="227"/>
observed, and lamented, the very indif∣ferent accommodation which the inn af∣forded his friends, and M. Mauron im∣mediately invited them to his chateau with a warmth of hospitality that over∣came every scruple which delicacy or pride could oppose. The woods that Adeline had traversed formed a part of his domain, which extended almost to the inn; but he insisted that his carriage should take his guests to the chateau, and departed to give orders for their reception. The pre∣sence of M. Verneiul, and the kindness of his friend, gave La Luc an unusual flow of spirits; he conversed with a degree of vigour and liveliness to which he had long been unaccustomed, and the smile of sa∣tisfaction that Clara gave to Adeline ex∣pressed how much she thought he was al∣ready benefited by the voyage. Adeline answered her look with a smile of less con∣fidence, for she attributed his present anima∣tion to a more temporary cause.</P>
<P>About half an hour after the departure of M. Mauron, a boy who served as wai∣ter brought a message from a chevalier then at the inn, requesting permission to speak with Adeline. The man who had pursued her along the sands instantly oc∣curred to her, and she scarcely doubted that the stranger was some person belong∣ing
<PB N="229" REF="228"/>
to the Marquis de Montalt, perhaps the Marquis himself, thought that he should have discovered her accidentally, in so obscure a place, and so immediately upon her arrival, seemed very improbable. With trembling lips, and a countenance pale as death, she inquired the name of the chevalier. The boy was not ac∣quainted with it. La Luc asked what sort of a person he was; but the boy, who understood little of the art of describing, gave such a confused account of him, that Adeline could only learn he was not large, but of the middle stature. This circumstance, however, convincing her it was not the Marquis de Montalt who desired to see her, she asked whe∣ther it would be agreeable to La Luc to have the stranger admitted. La Luc said, <Q REND="inline">"By all means;"</Q> and the waiter withdrew. Adeline sat in trembling ex∣pectation till the door opened, and Louis de la Motte entered the room. He advanced with an embarrassed and melan∣choly air, though his countenance had been enlightened with a momentary pleasure when he first beheld Adeline—Adeline, who was still the idol of his heart. After the first salutations were over, all apprehensions of the Marquis being now
<PB N="230" REF="229"/>
dissipated, she inquired when Louis had seen Monsieur and Madame La Motte.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I ought rather to ask you that ques∣tion,"</Q> said Louis, in some confusion, <Q REND="inline">"for I believe you have seen them since I have; and the pleasure of meeting you thus is equalled by my surprise. I have not heard from my father for some time, owing probably to my re∣giment being removed to new quar∣ters."</Q></P>
<P>He looked as if he wished to be inform∣ed with whom Adeline now was; but as this was a subject upon which it was im∣possible she could speak in the presence of La Luc, she led the conversation to general topics, after having said that Monsieur and Madame La Motte were well when she left them. Louis spoke little, and often looked anxiously at Ade∣line, while his mind seemed labouring un∣der strong oppression. She observed this, and recollecting the declaration he had made her on the morning of his departure from the Abbey, she attributed his present embarrassment to the effect of a passion yet unsubdued, and did not appear to no∣tice it. After he had sat near a quarter of an hour, under a struggle of feelings which he could neither conquer or con∣cal, he rose to leave the room, and as
<PB N="231" REF="230"/>
he passed Adeline, said, in a low voice, <Q REND="inline">"Do permit me to speak with you alone for five minutes."</Q> She hesitated in some con∣fusion, and then saying there were none but friends present, begged he would be seated.—<Q REND="inline">"Excuse me,"</Q> said he, in the same low ac∣cent; <Q REND="inline">"What I would say nearly concerns you, and you only. Do favour me with a few moments attention."</Q> He said this with a look that surprized her; and having ordered candles in another room, she went thi∣ther.</P>
<P>Louis sat for some moments silent, and seemingly in great perturbation of mind. At length he said, <Q REND="inline">"I know not whether to rejoice or to lament at this unexpected meeting, though, if you are in safe hands, I ought certainly to rejoice, however hard the task that now falls to my lot. I am not ignorant of the dangers and persecutions you have suffered, and cannot forbear expressing my anxiety to know how you are now circumstanced. Are you indeed with friends?"—</Q><Q REND="inline">"I am,"</Q> said Adeline; <Q REND="inline">"M. la Motte has informed you"—</Q><Q REND="inline">"No,"</Q> replied Louis, with a deep sigh, <Q REND="inline">"not my father."—</Q>He paused.—<Q REND="inline">"But I do indeed rejoice,"</Q> resumed he, <Q REND="inline">"O! how sincerely rejoice! that you are in safety. Could you know, lovely Adeline, what I have suffered!"—</Q>He checked himself.—<Q REND="inline">"I understood you had something of importance to say, Sir,"</Q> said
<PB N="232" REF="231"/>
Adeline; <Q REND="inline">"you must excuse me if I re∣mind you that I have not many moments to spare."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"It is indeed of importance,"</Q> replied Louis; <Q REND="inline">"yet I know not how to mention it—how to soften—This task is too severe. Alas! my poor friend!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Who is it you speak of, Sir!"</Q> said Adeline, with quickness. Louis rose from his chair, and walked about the room. <Q REND="inline">"I would prepare you for what I have to say,"</Q> he resumed, <Q REND="inline">"but upon my soul I am not equal to it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I entreat you to keep me no longer in suspence,"</Q> said Adeline, who had a wild idea that it was Theodore he would speak of. Louis still hesitated. <Q REND="inline">"Is it—O is it?—I conjure you tell me the worst at once,"</Q> said she, in a voice of agony. <Q REND="inline">"I can bear it—indeed I can."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"My unhappy friend!"</Q> exclaimed Louis, <Q REND="inline">"O Theodore!"—</Q><Q REND="inline">"Theodore!"</Q> faintly articulated Adeline, <Q REND="inline">"he lives then!"—</Q><Q REND="inline">"He does,"</Q> said Louis, <Q REND="inline">"but"—</Q>He stopped. <Q REND="inline">"—But what?"</Q> cried Adeline, trembling violently; <Q REND="inline">"If he is living you cannot tell me worse than my fears suggest; I entreat you, therefore, not to hesitate."—</Q>Louis resumed his seat, and endeavouring to assume a collected air, said, <Q REND="inline">"He is living, Ma∣dam, but he is a prisoner, and—for why
<PB N="233" REF="232"/>
should I deceive you? I fear he has little to hope in this world."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I have long feared so, Sir,"</Q> said Ade∣line, in a voice of forced composure; <Q REND="inline">"you have something more terrible than this to relate, and I again intreat you will ex∣plain yourself."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"He has every thing to apprehend from the Marquis de Montalt,"</Q> said Louis. <Q REND="inline">"Alas! why do I say to apprehend? His judgment is already fixed—he is con∣demned to die."</Q></P>
<P>At this confirmation of her fears a death∣like paleness diffused itself over the counte∣nance of Adeline; she sat motionless, and attempted to sigh, but seemed almost suf∣focated. Terrified at her situation, and ex∣pecting to see her faint, Louis would have supported her, but with her hand she waved him from her, and was unable to speak. He now called for assistance, and La Luc and Clara, with M. Verneuil, informed of Ade∣line's indisposition, were quickly by her side.</P>
<P>At the sound of their voices she looked up, and seemed to recollect herself, when utter∣ing a heavy sigh she burst into tears. La Luc rejoiced to see her weep, encouraged her tears, which, after some time, relieved her, and when she was able to speak, she desired to go back to La Luc's parlour. Louis attended her thither; when she was better
<PB N="234" REF="233"/>
he would have withdrawn, but La Luc begged he would stay.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You are perhaps a relation of this young lady, Sir,"</Q> said he, <Q REND="inline">"and may have brought news of her father."—</Q><Q REND="inline">"Not so, Sir,"</Q> replied Louis, hesitat∣ing.—<Q REND="inline">"This gentleman,"</Q> said Adeline, who had now recollected her dissipated thoughts, <Q REND="inline">"is the son of the M. La Motte, whom you may have heard me mention."—</Q>Louis seemed shocked to be declared the son of a man that had once acted so unworthily towards Ade∣line, who, instantly perceiving the pain her words occasioned, endeavoured to soften their effect by saying that La Motte had saved her from imminent danger, and had afforded her an asylum for many months. Adeline sat in a state of dread∣ful solitude to know the particulars of Theodore's situation, yet could not ac∣quire courage to renew the subject in the presence of La Luc; she ventured, how∣ever, to ask Louis if his own regiment was quartered in the town.</P>
<P>He replied that his regiment lay at Vaceau, a French town on the frontiers of Spain; that he had just crossed a part of the Gulph of Lyons, and was on his way to Savoy, whither he should set out early in the morning.</P>
<P><PB N="235" REF="234"/>
<Q REND="inline">"We are lately come from thence,"</Q> said Adeline; <Q REND="inline">"may I ask to what part of Savoy you are going?"—</Q><Q REND="inline">"To Lelon∣court,"</Q> he replied.—<Q REND="inline">"To Lelon∣court!"</Q> said Adeline, in some sur∣prize.—<Q REND="inline">"I am a stranger to the country,"</Q> resumed Louis; <Q REND="inline">"but I go to serve my friend. You seem to know Lelon∣court."—</Q><Q REND="inline">"I do indeed,"</Q> said Ade∣line.—<Q REND="inline">"You probably know then that M. La Luc lives there, and will guess the motive of my journey."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"O heavens! is it possible?"</Q> exclaim∣ed Adeline—<Q REND="inline">"is it possible that Theo∣dore Peyrou is a relation of M. La Luc!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Theodore! what of my son?"</Q> ask∣ed La Luc, in surprize and apprehen∣sion.—<Q REND="inline">"Your son!"</Q> said Adeline, in a trembling voice, <Q REND="inline">"your son!"—</Q>The astonishment and anguish depictured on her countenance increased the apprehen∣sions of this unfortunate father, and he renewed his question. But Adeline was totally unable to answer him; and the distress of Louis, on thus unexpectedly discovering the father of his unhappy friend, and knowing that it was his task to disclose the fate of his son, deprived him for some time of all power of utterance, and La Luc and Clara, whose fears were
<PB N="236" REF="235"/>
every instant heightened by this dreadful silence, continued to repeat their ques∣tions.</P>
<P>At length a sense of th e approaching sufferings of the good La Luc overcoming every other feeling, Adeline recovered strength of mind sufficient to try to sof∣ten the intelligence Louis had to com∣municate, and to conduct Clara to ano∣ther room. Here she collected resolution to tell her, and with much tender conside∣ration, the circumstances of her brother's situation, concealing only her knowledge of his sentence being already pronoun∣ced. This relation necessarily included the mention of their attachment, and in the friend of her heart Clara discovered the innocent cause of her brother's de∣struction. Adeline also learned the oc∣casion of that circumstance which had contributed to keep her ignorant of Theodore's relationship to La Luc; she was told the former had taken the name of Peyrou, with an estate which had been left him about a year before by a relation of his mother's upon that con∣dition. Theodore had been designed for the church, but his disposition inclined him to a more active life than the clerical habit would admit of, and on his acces∣sion
<PB N="237" REF="236"/>
to this estate he had entered into the service of the French King.</P>
<P>In the few and interrupted interviews which had been allowed them at Caux, Theodore had mentioned his family to Adeline only in general terms, and thus, when they were so suddenly separated, had, without designing it, left her in ignorance of his father's name and place of residence.</P>
<P>The sacredness and delicacy of Ade¦line's grief, which had never permitted her to mention the subject of it even to Clara, had since contributed to deceive her.</P>
<P>The distress of Clara, on learning the situation of her brother, could en∣dure no restraint; Adeline, who had commanded her feelings so as to impart this intelligence with tolerable compo∣sure, only by a strong effort of mind, was now almost overwhelmed by her own and Clara's accumulated suffering. While they wept forth the anguish of their hearts, a scene, if possible, more affecting passed be∣tween La Luc and Louis, who perceived it was necessary to inform him, though cautiously and by degrees, of the full ex∣tent of his calamity. He therefore told La Luc, that though Theodore had been first tried for the offence of having quit∣ted
<PB N="238" REF="237"/>
his post, he was now condemned on a charge of assault made upon his gene∣ral officer, the Marquis de Montalt, who had brought witnesses to prove that his life had been endangered by the circum∣stance; and who having pursued the pro∣secution with the most bitter rancour, had at length obtained the sentence which the law could not withhold, but which every other officer in the regiment de∣plored.</P>
<P>Louis added, that the sentence was to be executed in less than a fortnight, and that Theodore being very unhappy at receiving no answers to the letters he had sent his father, wishing to see him once more, and knowing that there was now no time to be lost, had requested him to go to Leloncourt and acquaint his father with his situation.</P>
<P>La Luc received the account of his son's condition with a distress that admit∣ted neither of tears or complaint. He asked whether Theodore was, and desiring to be conducted to him, he thanked Louis for all his kindness, and ordered post horses immediately.</P>
<P>A carriage was soon ready, and this unhappy father, after taking a mournful leave of M. Verneuil, and sending a compliment to M. Mauron, attended by
<PB N="239" REF="238"/>
his family, set out for the prison of his son. The journey was a silent one; each individual of the party endeavoured, in consideration of each other, to suppress the expression of grief, but was unable to do more. La Luc appeared calm and complacent; he seemed frequently to be engaged in prayer; but a struggle for resignation and composure was sometimes visible upon his countenance, notwithstand∣ing the efforts of his mind.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WE now return to the Marquis de Montalt, who having seen La Motte safely lodged in the prison of D—y, and learning the trial would not come on immediately, had returned <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his villa on the borders of the forest, where he expected to hear news of Adeline. It had been his intention to follow his servants to Lyons; but he now deter∣mined to wait a few days for letters, and he had little doubt that Adeline, since her flight had been so quickly pur∣sued, would be overtaken, and probably
<PB N="240" REF="239"/>
before she could reach that city. In this expectation he had been miserably dis∣appointed; for his servants informed him, that though they traced her thither, they had neither been able to follow her route beyond, nor to discover her at Lyons. This escape she probably owed to hav∣ing embarked on the Rhone, for it does not appear that the Marquis's people thought of seeking her on the course of that river.</P>
<P>His presence was soon after required at Vaceau, where the court martial was then sitting; thither, therefore, he went, with passions still more exasperated by his late disappointment, and procured the condemnation of Theodore. The sentence was universally lamented, for Theodore was much beloved in his regi∣ment; and the occasion of the Marquis's personal resentment towards him being known, every heart was interested in his cause.</P>
<P>Louis de la Motte happening at this time to be stationed in the same town, heard an imperfect account of his story, and being convinced that the prisoner was the young chevalier whom he had formerly seen with the Marquis at the Abbey, he was induced partly from compassion, and partly with a hope of hearing of his
<PB N="241" REF="240"/>
parents, to visit him. The compassionate sympathy which Louis expressed, and the zeal with which he tendered his ser∣vices, affected Theodore, and excited in him a warm return of friendship. Louis made him frequent visits, did every thing that kindness could suggest to alleviate his sufferings, and a mutual esteem and confi∣dence ensued.</P>
<P>Theodore at length communicated the chief subject of his concern to Louis, who discovered with inexpressible grief, that it was Adeline whom the Marquis had thus cruelly persecuted, and Adeline for whose sake the generous Theodore was about to suffer. He soon perceived also that Theodore was his favoured rival; but he generous∣ly suppressed the jealous pang this discovery occasioned, and determined that no pre∣judice of passion should withdraw him from the duties of humanity and friendship. He eagerly inquired where Adeline then resided. <Q REND="inline">"She is yet, I fear, in the power of the Marquis,"</Q> said Theodore, sighing deeply. <Q REND="inline">"O God!—these chains!"—</Q>and he threw an agonizing glance upon them. Louis sat silent and thoughtful; at length starting from his reverie, he said he would go to the Marquis, and immediately quitted the prison. The Marquis was, however, al∣ready set off for Paris, where he had been
<PB N="242" REF="241"/>
summoned to appear at the approaching trial of La Motte; and Louis, yet ignorant of the late transactions at the Abbey, re∣turned to the prison, where he endeavoured to forget that Theodore was the favoured rival of his love, and to remember him only as the defender of Adeline. So ear∣nestly he pressed his offers of service, that Theodore, whom the silence of his father equally surprized and afflicted, and who was very anxious to see him once again, accepted his proposal of going himself to Savoy. <Q REND="inline">"My letters I stongly suspect to have been intercepted by the Marquis,"</Q> said Theodore; <Q REND="inline">"if so, my poor father will have the whole weight of this ca∣lamity to sustain at once, unless I avail myself of your kindness, and I shall nei∣ther see him nor hear from him before I die. Louis! there are moments when my fortitude shrinks from the conflict, and my senses threaten to desert me."</Q></P>
<P>No time was to be lost; the warrant for his execution had already received the king's signature, and Louis immediately set forward for Savoy. The letters of Theodore had indeed been intercepted by order of the Marquis, who, in the hope of discovering the asylum of Adeline, had opened and afterwards destroyed them.</P>
<P>But to return to La Luc, who now
<PB N="243" REF="242"/>
drew near Vaceau, and whom his family observed to be greatly changed in his looks since he had heard the late calamitous in∣telligence; he uttered no complaint; but it was too obvious that his disorder had made a rapid progress. Louis, who, during the journey, proved the goodness of his disposition by the delicate attentions he paid this unhappy party, concealed his observation of the decline of La Luc, and, to support Adeline's spirits, endeavoured to convince her that her apprehensions on this subject were groundless. Her spirits did indeed require support, for she was now within a few miles of the town that contain∣ed Theodore; and while her increasing perturbation almost overcome her, she yet tried to appear composed. When the carriage entered the town, she cast a timid and anxious glance from the window in search of the prison; but having passed through several streets without perceiving any building which corresponded with her idea of that she looked for, the coach stopped at the inn. The frequent changes in La Luc's countenance betrayed the violent agitation of his mind, and when he attempted to alight, feeble and ex∣hausted, he was compelled to accept the support of Louis, to whom he saintly said, as he passed to the parlour, <Q REND="inline">"I am indeed sick at heart, but I trust the pain
<PB N="244" REF="243"/>
will not be long."</Q> Louis pressed his hand without speaking, and hastened back for Adeline and Clara, who were already in the passage. La Luc wiped the tears from his eyes, (they were the first he had shed) as they entered the room. <Q REND="inline">"I would go immediately to my poor boy,"</Q> said he to Louis; <Q REND="inline">"yours, Sir, is a mournful office.—be so good as to conduct me to him."</Q> He rose to go, but, feeble and overcome with grief, again sat down. Adeline and Clara united in entreating that he would compose himself, and take some refreshment, and Louis urging the necessity of preparing Theodore for the in∣terview, prevailed with him to delay it till his son should be informed of his arrival, and immediately quitted the inn for the prison of his friend. When he was gone, La Luc, as a duty he owed those he loved, tried to take some support, but the convul∣sions of his throat would not suffer him to swallow the wine that he held to his parch∣ed lips, and he was now so much disor∣dered, that he desired to retire to his chamber, where alone, and in prayer, he passed the dreadful interval of Louis's absence.</P>
<P>Clara on the bosom of Adeline, who sat in calm but deep distress, yielded to the violence of her grief. <Q REND="inline">"I shall lose
<PB N="245" REF="244"/>
my dear father too,"</Q> said she; <Q REND="inline">"I see it; I shall lose my father and my bro∣ther together."</Q> Adeline wept with her friend for some time in silence; and then attempted to persuade her that La Luc was not so ill as she apprehended.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Do not mislead me with hope,"</Q> she replied, <Q REND="inline">"he will not survive the shock of this calamity—I saw it from the first."</Q> Adeline knowing that La Luc's distress would be heightened by the obser∣vance of his daughter's, and that indulgence would only encrease its poignancy, endea∣voured to arouse her to an exertion of fortitude by urging the necessity of com∣manding her emotion in the presence of her father. <Q REND="inline">"This is possible,"</Q> added she, <Q REND="inline">"however painful may be the ef∣fort. You must know, my dear, that my grief is not inferior to your own, yet I have hitherto been enabled to support my sufferings in silence, for M. La Luc I do, indeed, love and reverence as a parent."</Q></P>
<P>Louis meanwhile reached the prison of Theodore, who received him with an air of mingled surprize and impatience. <Q REND="inline">"What brings you back so soon,"</Q> said he, <Q REND="inline">"have you heard news of my father?"</Q> Louis now gradually unfolded the circum∣stances of their meeting, and La Luc's
<PB N="246" REF="245"/>
arrival at Vaceau. A various emotion agi∣tated the countenance of Theodore on re∣ceiving this intelligence. <Q REND="inline">"My poor fa∣ther!"</Q> said he, <Q REND="inline">"he has then followed his son to this ignominious place! Lit∣tle did I think when last we parted he would meet me in a prison, under con∣demnation!"</Q> This reflection roused an impetuosity of grief which deprived him for some time of speech. <Q REND="inline">"But where is he?"</Q> said Theodore, recovering himself; <Q REND="inline">"now he is come, I shrink from the interview I have so much wished for. The sight of his distress will be dreadful to me. Louis! when I am gone—comfort my poor father."</Q> His voice was again in∣terrupted by sobs; and Louis, who had been fearful of acquainting him at the same time of the arrival of La Luc, and the dis∣covery of Adeline, now judged it proper to administer the cordial of this latter intel∣ligence.</P>
<P>The glooms of a prison, and of calamity, vanished for a transient moment; those who had seen Theodore would have believed this to be the instant which gave him life and liberty. When his first emotions subsided, <Q REND="inline">"I will not repine,"</Q> said he; <Q REND="inline">"since I know that Adeline is preserved, and that I shall once more see my father, I will endeavour to die with resignation."</Q> He
<PB N="247" REF="246"/>
enquired if La Luc was there in the prison; and was told he was at the inn with Clara and Adeline. <Q REND="inline">"Adeline! Is Adeline there too!—This is beyond my hopes. Yet why do I rejoice? I must never see her more: this is no place for Adeline."</Q> Again he relapsed into an agony of distress—and again repeated a thousand questions concerning Adeline, till he was reminded by Louis that his father was impatient to see him—when, shocked that he had so long detained his friend, he entreated him to conduct La Luc to the prison, and en∣deavour to recollect fortitude for the ap∣proaching interview.</P>
<P>When Louis returned to the inn La Luc was still in his chamber, and Clara quitting the room to call him, Adeline seized with trembling impatience the opportunity to en∣quire more particularly concerning Theo∣dore, than she chose to do in the presence of his unhappy sister. Lewis represented him to be much more tranquil than he real∣ly was: Adeline was somewhat soothed by the account; and her tears, hitherto re∣strained, flowed silently and fast, till La Luc appeared. His countenance had re∣covered its serenity, but was impressed with a deep and steady sorrow, which excited in the beholder a mingled emotion of pity and reverence. <Q REND="inline">"How is my son? sir,"</Q> said
<PB N="248" REF="247"/>
he as he entered the room. <Q REND="inline">"We will go to him immediately."</Q></P>
<P>Clara renewed the entreaties that had been already rejected, to accompany her father, who persisted in a refusal. <Q REND="inline">"To∣morrow you shall see him,"</Q> added he; <Q REND="inline">"but our first meeting must be alone. Stay with your friend, my dear; she has need of consolation."</Q> When La Luc was gone, Adeline, unable longer to strug∣gle against the force of grief, retired to her chamber and her bed.</P>
<P>La Luc walked silently towards the prison, resting on the arm of Lewis. It was now night: a dim lamp that hung above shewed them the gates, and Louis rung a bell; La Luc, almost overcome with agitation, lean∣ed against the postern till the porter appear∣ed. He enquired for Theodore, and fol∣lowed the man.; but when he reached the second court yard he seemed ready to faint, and again stopped. Louis desired the porter would fetch some water; but La Luc, re∣covering his voice, said he should soon be better, and would not suffer him to go. In a few minutes he was able to follow Louis, who led him through several dark passages, and up a flight of steps to a door, which being unbarred, disclosed to him the prison of his son. He was seated at a small table, on which stood a lamp that
<PB N="249" REF="248"/>
threw a feeble light across the place, sufficient only to shew its desolation and wretchedness. When he perceived La Luc he sprung from his chair, and in the next moment was in his arms. <Q REND="inline">"My father!"</Q> said he in a tremu∣lous voice. <Q REND="inline">"My son!"</Q> exclaimed La Luc; and they were for some time silent, and locked in each other's embrace. At length Theodore led him to the only chair the room afforded, and seating himself with Louis at the foot of the bed, had leisure to observe the ravages which illness and ca∣lamity had made on the features of his pa∣rent. La Luc made several efforts to speak, but unable to articulate, laid his hand upon his breast and sighed deeply. Fearful of the consequence of so affecting a scene on his shattered frame, Lewis endeavoured to call off his attention from the immediate object of his distress, and interrupted the silence; but La Luc shuddering, and complaining he was very cold, sunk back in his chair. His condition roused Theodore from the stupor of despair; and while he flew to sup∣port his father, Louis ran out for other as∣sistance.—<Q REND="inline">"I shall soon be better, Theo∣dore,"</Q> said La Luc, unclosing his eye, <Q REND="inline">"the faintness is already going off. I have not been well of late; and this sad meet∣ing!"</Q> Unable any longer to command himself, Theodore wrung his hand, and
<PB N="250" REF="249"/>
the distress which had long struggled for utterance burst in convulsive sobs from his breast. La Luc gradually revived, and ex∣erted himself to calm the transports of his son; but the fortitude of the latter had now entirely forsaken him, and he could only utter exclamation and complaint. <Q REND="inline">"Ah! little did I think we should ever meet un∣der circumstances so dreadful as the pre∣sent! But I have not deserved them, my father! the motives of my conduct have still been just<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"That is my supreme consolation,"</Q> said La Luc, <Q REND="inline">"and ought to support you in this hour of trial. The Almighty God, who is the judge of hearts, will reward you hereafter. Trust in him, my son; I look to him with no feeble hope, but with a firm reliance on his justice!"</Q> La Luc's voice faultered; he raised his eyes to hea∣ven with an expression of meek devotion, while the tears of humanity fell slowly on his cheek.</P>
<P>Still more affected by his last words, Theodore turned from him, and paced the room with quick steps: the entrance of Louis was a very seasonable relief to La Luc, who, taking a cordial he had brought, was soon sufficiently restored to discourse on the subject most interesting to him. Theo∣dore tried to attain a command of his feel∣ings,
<PB N="251" REF="250"/>
and succeeded. He conversed with tolerable composure for above an hour, dur∣ing which La Luc endeavoured to elevate, by religious hope, the mind of his son, and to enable him to meet with fortitude the aweful hour that approached. But the ap∣pearance of resignation which Theodore at∣tained always vanished, when he reflected that he was going to leave his father a prey to grief, and his beloved Adeline for ever. When La Luc was about to depart, he again mentioned her. <Q REND="inline">"Afflicting as an inter∣view must be in our present circumstan∣ces,"</Q> said he, <Q REND="inline">"I cannot bear the thought of quitting the world without seeing her once again; yet I know not how to ask her to encounter, for my sake, the mi∣sery of a parting scene. Tell her that my thoughts never, for a moment, leave her; that"—</Q>La Luc interrupted, and assured him, that since he so much wish∣ed it, he should see her, though a meeting could serve only to heighten the mutual an∣guish of a final separation.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I know it—I know it too well,"</Q> said Theodore; <Q REND="inline">"yet I cannot resolve to see her no more, and thus spare her the pain this interview must inflict. O my father! when I think of those whom I must soon leave for ever, my heart breaks. But I will indeed try to profit by your
<PB N="252" REF="251"/>
precept and example, and shew that your paternal care has not been in vain. My good Louis, go with my father—he has need of support. How much I owe this generous friend,"</Q> added Theodore, <Q REND="inline">"you well know, Sir."—</Q><Q REND="inline">"I do in truth,"</Q> replied La Luc, <Q REND="inline">"and can never repay his kindness to you. He has contributed to support us all; but you require comfort more than myself—he shall remain with you—I will go alone."</Q></P>
<P>This Theodore would not suffer; and La Luc no longer opposing him, they af∣fectionately embraced, and separated for the night.</P>
<P>When they reached the inn, La Luc con∣sulted with Louis on the possibility of ad∣dressing a petition to the sovereign, time enough to save Theodore. His distance from Paris, and the short interval before the period fixed for the execution of the sen∣tence, made this design difficult; but be∣lieving it was practicable, La Luc, incapa∣ble as he appeared of performing so long a journey, determined to attempt it. Louis, thinking that the undertaking would prove fatal to the father, without benefiting the son, endeavoured, though faintly, to dissuade him from it—but his resolution was fixed.—<Q REND="inline">"If I sacrifice the small remains of my life in the service of my child,"</Q> said he,
<PB N="253" REF="252"/>
<Q REND="inline">"I shall lose little: if I save him, I shall gain every thing. There is no time to be lost—I will set off immediately."</Q></P>
<P>He would have ordered post horses, but Louis, and Clara, who was now come from the bed-side of her friend, urged the necessity of his taking a few hours repose: he was at length compelled to acknowledge himself unequal to the immediate exertion which the parental anxiety prompted, and consented to seek rest.</P>
<P>When he had retired to his chamber, Clara lamented the condition of her father.—<Q REND="inline">"He will not bear the journey,"</Q> said she; <Q REND="inline">"he is greatly changed within these few days."—</Q>Louis was so entirely of her opinion, that he could not disguise it, even to flatter her with a hope. She added, what did not contribute to raise his spirits, that Adeline was so much indisposed by her grief for the situation of Theodore, and the suf∣ferings of La Luc, that she dreaded the con∣sequence.</P>
<P>It has been seen that the passion of young La Motte had suffered no abatement from time or absence; on the contrary, the per∣secution and the dangers which had pur∣sued Adeline awakened all his tenderness, and drew her nearer to his heart. When he had discovered that Theodore loved her, and was beloved again, he experienced all
<PB N="254" REF="253"/>
the anguish of jealousy and disappointment; for though she had forbade him to hope, he found it too painful an effort to obey her, and had secretly cherished the flame which he ought to have stifled. His heart was however, too noble to suffer his zeal for Theodore to abate because he was his fa∣voured rival, and his mind too strong not to conceal the anguish this certainty occa∣sioned. The attachment which Theodore had testified towards Adeline even endeared him to Louis, when he had recovered from the first shock of disappointment, and that conquest over jealousy which originated in principle, and was pursued with difficulty, became afterwards his pride and his glory. When, however, he again saw Adeline—saw her in the mild dignity of sorrow more interesting than ever—saw her, though sinking beneath its pressure, yet tender and solicitous to soften the afflictions of those around her—it was with the utmost dif∣ficulty he preserved his resolution, and for∣bore to express the sentiments she inspired. When he farther considered that her acute sufferings arose from the strength of her affection, he more than ever wished him∣self the object of a heart capable of so tender a regard, and Theodore in prison and in chains was a momentary object of envy.</P>
<P><PB N="255" REF="254"/>
In the morning, when La Luc arose from short and disturbed slumbers, he found Louis, Clara, and Adeline, whom indis∣position could not prevent from paying him this testimony of respect and affection, as∣sembled in the parlour of the inn to see him depart. After a slight breakfast, during which his feelings permitted him to say little, he bade his friends a sad farewell, and stepped into the carriage, followed by their tears and prayers—Adeline imme∣diately retired to her chamber, which she was too ill to quit that day. In the evening Clara left her friend, and, conducted by Louis, went to visit her brother, whose emotions, on hearing of his father's depar∣ture, were various and strong.</P>

<P>WE return now to Pierre De la Motte, who, after remaining some weeks in the prison of D—y, was removed to take his
<PB N="256" REF="255"/>
trial in the courts of Paris, whither the Marquis de Montalt followed to prosecute the charge. Madame De la Motte accom∣panied her husband to the prison of the Cha∣telet. His mind sunk under the weight of his misfortunes; nor could all the efforts of his wife rouse him from the torpidity of despair which a consideration of his circum∣stances occasioned. Should he be even ac∣quitted of the charge brought against him by the Marquis, (which was very unlikely) he was now in the scene of his former crimes, and the moment that should liberate him from the walls of his prison would pro∣bably deliver him again into the hands of offended justice.</P>
<P>The prosecution of the Marquis was too well founded, and its object of a nature too serious, not to justify the terror of La Motte. Soon after the latter had settled at the Abbey of St. Clair, the small stock of money which the emergency of his circum∣stances had left him being nearly exhaust∣ed, his mind became corroded with the most cruel anxiety concerning the means of his future subsistence. As he was one evening riding alone in a remote part of the forest, musing on his distressed circumstan∣ces, and meditating plans to relieve the exi∣gencies which he saw approaching, he per∣ceived among the trees at some distance a
<PB N="257" REF="256"/>
chevalier on horseback, who was riding de∣liberately along, and seemed wholly unat∣tended. A thought darted across the mind of La Motte, that he might be spared the evils which threatened him by robbing this stranger. His former practices had passed the boundary of honesty—fraud was in some degree familiar to him—and the thought was not dismissed. He hesitated—every moment of hesitation increased the power of temptation—the opportunity was such as might never occur again. He looked round, and as far as the trees open∣ed saw no person but the chevalier, who seemed by his air to be a man of distinction. Summoning all his courage, La Motte rode forward and attacked him. The Marquis de Montalt, for it was him, was unarmed, but knowing that his attendants were not far off, he refused to yield While they were struggling for victory, La Motte saw several horsemen enter the extremity of the avenue, and, rendered desperate by oppo∣sition and delay, he drew from his pocket a pistol, (which an apprehension of ban∣ditti made him usually carry when he rode to a distance from the Abbey) and fired at the Marquis, who staggered and fell senseless to the ground. La Motte had time to tear from his coat a brilliant star, some diamond rings from his fingers, and to rifle his poc∣kets,
<PB N="258" REF="257"/>
before his attendants came up. In∣stead of pursuing the robber, they all, in their first confusion, flew to assist their lord, and La Motte escaped.</P>
<P>He stopped before he reached the Abbey at a little ruin, the tomb formerly mention∣ed, to examine his booty. It consisted of a purse containing seventy louis d'ors; of a diamond star, three rings of great value, and a miniature set with brilliants of the Marquis himself, which he had intended as a present for his favourite mistress. To La Motte, who but a few hours before had seen himself nearly destitute, the view of this treasure excited an almost ungovern∣able transport; but it was soon checked when he remembered the means he had employed to obtain it, and that he had paid for the wealth he contemplated the price of blood. Naturally violent in his pas∣sions, this reflection sunk him from the summit of exultation to the abyss of des∣pondency. He considered himself a mur∣derer, and startled as one awakened from a dream, would have given half the world, had it been his, to have been as poor, and comparatively, as guiltless as a few preced∣ing hours had seen him. On examining the portrait he discovered the resemblance, and believing that his hand had deprived the original of life, he gazed upon the picture
<PB N="259" REF="258"/>
with unutterable anguish. To the horrors of remorse succeeded the perplexities of fear. Apprehensive of he knew not what, he lingered at the tomb, where he at length deposited his treasure, believing that if his offence should awaken justice, the Abbey might be searched, and these jewels betray him. From Madame La Motte it was easy to conceal his increase of wealth; for as he had never made her acquainted with the exact state of his finances, she had not suspected the extreme poverty which menaced him, and as they continued to live as usual, she believed that their expen∣ces were drawn from the usual supply. But it was not so easy to disguise the work∣ings of remorse and horror: his manner became gloomy and reserved, and his fre∣quent visits to the tomb, where he went partly to examine his treasure, but chief∣ly to indulge in the dreadful pleasure of contemplating the picture of the Mar∣quis, excited curiosity. In the solitude of the forest, where no variety of objects occurred to renovate his ideas, the horri∣ble one of having committed murder was ever present to him.—When the Marquis arrived at the Abbey, the asto∣nishment and terror of La Motte, for at first he scarce knew whether he beheld the shadow or the substance of a human
<PB N="260" REF="259"/>
form, were quickly succeeded by appre∣hension of the punishment due to the crime he had really committed When his distress had prevailed on the Marquis to retire, he informed him that he was by birth a chevalier: he then touched upon such parts of his misfortunes as he thought would excite pity, expressed such abhor∣rence of his guilt, and voluntarily uttered such a solemn promise of returning the jewels he had yet in his possession, for he had ventured to dispose only of a small part, that the Marquis at length listened to him with some degree of com∣passion. This favourable sentiment, second∣ed by a selfish motive, induced the Marquis to compromise with La Motte. Of quick and inflammable passions, he had observed the beauty of Adeline with an eye of no common regard, and he resolved to spare the life of La Motte upon no other condition than the sacrifice of this unfortunate girl. La Motte had neither resolution or virtue sufficient to reject the terms—the jewels were restored, and he consented to betray the innocent Adeline. But as he was too well acquainted with her heart to believe that she would easily be won to the practice of vice, and as he still felt a degree of pity and tenderness for her, he endeavoured to prevail on the Marquis to forbear precipi∣tate
<PB N="261" REF="260"/>
measures, and to attempt gradually to undermine her principles by seducing her affections. He approved and adopted this plan: the failure of his first scheme in∣duced him to employ the stratagems he after∣wards pursued, and thus to multiply the misfortunes of Adeline.</P>
<P>Such were the circumstances which had brought La Motte to his present deplorable situation. The day of trial was now come, and he was led from prison into the court, where the Marquis appeared as his accuser. When the charge was delivered, La Motte, as is usual, pleaded not guilty, and the Advo∣cate Nemours, who had undertaken to plead for him, afterwards endeavoured to make it appear that the accusation, on the part of the Marquis de Montalt, was false and malicious. To this purpose he men∣tioned the circumstance of the latter having attempted to persuade his client to the mur∣der of Adeline: he farther urged that the Marquis had lived in habits of intimacy with La Motte for several months immediately preceding his arrest, and that it was not till he had disappointed the designs of his ac∣cuser, by conveying beyond his reach the unhappy object of his vengeance, that the Marquis had thought proper to charge La Motte with the crime for which he stood in∣dicted. Nemours urged the improbability of
<PB N="262" REF="261"/>
one man's keeping up a friendly intercourse with another from whom he had suffered the double injury of assault and robbery; yet it was certain that the Marquis had observed a frequent intercourse with La Motte for some months following the time specified for the commission of the crime. If the Marquis intended to prosecute, why was it not immediately after his discovery of La Mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>? and if not then, what had in∣fluenced him to prosecute at so distant a pe∣riod?</P>
<P>To <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>is nothing was replied on the part of the Marquis; for as his conduct on this point had been subservient to his designs on Adeline, he could not justify it but by exposing schemes which would betray the darkness of his character, and invalidate his cause. He, therefore, contented himself with producing several of his servants as witnesses of the assault and robbery, who swore without scruple to the person of La Motte, though not one of them had seen him otherwise than through the gloom of evening and riding off at full speed. On a cross examination most of them contradicted each other; their evidence was of course rejected; but as the Marquis had yet two other witnesses to produce, whose arrival at Paris had been hourly expected, the event of the trial was postponed, and the court adjourned.</P>
<P><PB N="263" REF="262"/>
La Motte was re-conducted to his prison under the same pressure of despondency with which he had quitted it. As he walk∣ed through one of the avenues he passed a man who stood by to let him proceed, and who regarded him with a fixed and ear∣nest eye. La Motte thought he had seen him before; but the imperfect view he caught of his features through the duskiness of the place made him uncertain as to this, and his mind was in too perturbed a state to suffer him to feel an interest on the subject. When he was gone, the stranger inquired of the keeper of the prison, who La Motte was; on being told, and receiving answers to some farther questions he put, he desired he might be admitted to speak with him. The re∣quest, as the man was only a debtor, was granted; but as the doors were now shut for the night, the interview was deferred till the morrow.</P>
<P>La Motte found Madame in his room, where she had been waiting for some hours to hear the event of the trial. They now wished more earnestly than ever to see their son; but they were, as he had sus∣pected, ignorant of his change of quarters, owing to the letters which he had, as usual, addressed to them under an assumed name, remaining at the post-house of Auboin. This circumstance occasioned Madame La
<PB N="264" REF="263"/>
Motte to address her letters to the place of her son's late residence, and he had thus continued ignorant of his father's misfor∣tunes and removal. Madame La Motte, surprized at receiving no answers to her letters, sent off another, containing an ac∣count of the trial as far as it had proceeded, and a request that her son would obtain leave of absence, and set out for Paris in∣stantly. As she was still ignorant of the failure of her letters, and had it been other∣wise, would not have known whither to have sent them, she directed this as usual.</P>
<P>Mean while his approaching fate was never absent for a moment from the mind of La Motte, which, feeble by nature, and still more enervated by habits of in∣dulgence, refused to support him at this dread∣ful period.</P>
<P>While these scenes were passing at Paris, La Luc arrived there without any accident after performing a journey, during which he had been supported almost entirely by the spirit of his resolution. He hastened to throw himself at the feet of the sovereign, and such was the excess of his feeling on present∣ing the petition which was to decide the fate of his son, that he could only look silently up, and then fainted. The king received the paper, and giving orders for the unhappy father to be taken care of, passed on. He
<PB N="265" REF="264"/>
was carried back to his hotel, where he awaited the event of this his final effort.</P>
<P>Adeline, mean while, continued at Va∣ceau in a state of anxiety too powerful for her long agitated frame, and the illness in consequence of this, confined her almost wholly to her chamber. Sometimes she ventured to flatter herself with a hope that the journey of La Luc would be successful: but these short and illusive intervals of com∣fort served only to heighten, by contrast, the despondency that succeeded, and in the alternate extremes of feeling she experi∣enced a state more torturing than that pro∣duced either by the sharp sting of unexpected calamity, or the sullen pain of settled des∣pair.</P>
<P>When she was well enough she came down to the parlour to converse with Louis, who brought her frequent accounts of Theo∣dore, and who passed every moment he could snatch from the duty of his profession in endeavours to support and console his af∣flicted friends. Adeline and Theodore, both looked to him for the little comfort allotted them, for he brought them intelligence of each other, and whenever he appeared, a transient melancholy kind of pleasure played round their hearts. He could not con∣ceal from Theodore Adeline's indisposi∣tion, since it was necessary to account for
<PB N="266" REF="265"/>
her not indulging the earnest wish he re∣peatedly expressed to see her again. To Adeline he spoke chiefly of the fortitude and resignation of his friend, not how∣ever forgetting to mention the tender af∣fection he constantly expressed for her. Accustomed to derive her sole consolation from the presence of Louis, and to ob∣serve his unwearied friendship towards him whom she so truly loved, she found her esteem for him ripen into gratitude, and her regard daily increase.</P>
<P>The fortitude with which he had said Theodore supported his calamities was somewhat exaggerated. He could not suffi∣ciently forget those ties which bound him to life to meet his fate with firmness; but though the paroxysms of grief were acute and frequent, he sought, and often attained in the presence of his friends, a manly composure. From the event of his father's journey he hoped little, yet that little was sufficient to keep his mind in the torture of suspence till the issue should appear.</P>
<P>On the day preceding that fixed for the execution of the sentence La Luc reached Vaceau. Adeline was at her chamber win∣dow when the carriage drew up to the inn; she saw him alight, and with feeble steps, supported by Peter, enter the house. From the languor of his air she drew no favoura∣ble
<PB N="267" REF="266"/>
omen, and, almost sinking under the violence of her emotion, she went to meet him. Clara was already with her father when Adeline entered the room. She ap∣proached him, but, dreading to receive from his lips a confirmation of the misfor∣tune his countenance seemed to indicate, she looked expressively at him and sat down, unable to speak the question she would have asked. He held out his hand to her in si∣lence, sunk back in his chair, and seemed to be fainting under oppression of heart. His manner confirmed all her fears; at this dreadful conviction her senses failed her, and she sat motionless and stupified.</P>
<P>La Luc and Clara were too much oc∣cupied by their own distress to observe her situation; after some time she breathed a heavy sigh, and burst into tears. Reliev∣ed by weeping, her spirits gradually return∣ed, and she at length said to La Luc, <Q REND="inline">"It is unnecessary, Sir, to ask the success of your journey; yet, when you can bear to mention the subject I wish"—</Q></P>
<P>La Luc waved his hand—<Q REND="inline">"Alas!"</Q> said he, <Q REND="inline">"I have nothing to tell but what you already guess too well. My poor Theodore!"—</Q>His voice was convulsed with sorrow, and some moments of unutter∣able anguish followed.</P>
<P>Adeline was the first who recovered
<PB N="268" REF="267"/>
sufficient recollection to notice the extreme languor of La Luc, and attend to his support. She ordered him refreshments, and entreat∣ed he would retire to his bed and suffer her to send for a physician; adding, that the fatigue he had suffered made repose abso∣lutely necessary. <Q REND="inline">"Would that I could find it, my dear child,"</Q> said he; <Q REND="inline">"it is not in this world that I must look for it, but in a better, and that better, I trust, I shall soon attain. But where is our good friend, Louis La Motte? He must lead me to my son."—</Q>Grief again in∣terrupted his utterance, and the entrance of Louis was a very seasonable relief to them all. Their tears explained the question he would have asked; La Luc immediately inquired for his son, and thanking Louis for all his kindness to him, desired to be conducted to the prison. Louis endeavour∣ed to persuade him to defer his visit till the morning, and Adeline and Clara joined their entreaties with his, but La Luc de∣termined to go that night.—<Q REND="inline">"His time is short,"</Q> said he; <Q REND="inline">"a few hours and I shall see him no more, at least in this world: let me not neglect these precious moments. Adeline! I had promised my poor boy that he should see you once more; you are not now equal to the meeting. I will try to
<PB N="269" REF="268"/>
reconcile him to the disappointment; but if I fail, and you are better in the morning, I know you will exert your∣self to sustain the interview."—</Q>Ade∣line looked impatient, and attempted to speak. La Luc rose to depart, but could only reach the door of the room, where, faint and feeble, he sat down in a chair. <Q REND="inline">"I must submit to necessity,"</Q> said he; <Q REND="inline">"I find I am not able to go farther to-night. Go to him, La Motte, and tell him I am somewhat disordered by my journey, but that I will be with him early in the morning. Do not flatter him with a hope; prepare him for the worst."—</Q>There was a pause of silence; La Luc at length recovering himself, desired Clara would order his bed to be got ready, and she willingly obeyed. When he withdrew, Adeline told Louis, what was indeed unne∣cessary, the event of La Luc's journey. <Q REND="inline">"I own,"</Q> continued she, <Q REND="inline">"that I had sometimes suffered myself to hope, and I now feel this calamity with double force. I fear too that M. La Luc will sink under its pressure; he is much al∣tered for the worse since he set out for Paris. Tell me your opinion sincere∣ly."</Q></P>
<P>The change was so obvious, that Louis could not deny it, but he endeavoured
<PB N="270" REF="269"/>
to sooth her apprehension by ascribing this alteration, in a great measure, to the temporary fatigue of travelling. Ade∣line declared her resolution of accom∣panying La Luc to take leave of Theo∣dore in the morning. <Q REND="inline">"I know not how I shall support the interview,"</Q> said she; <Q REND="inline">"but to see him once more is a duty I owe both to him and myself. The re∣membrance of having neglected to give him this last proof of affection would pur∣sue me with incessant remorse."</Q></P>
<P>After some farther conversation on this subject Louis withdrew to the prison, ruminating on the best means of impart∣ing to his friend the fatal intelligence he had to communicate. Theodore received it with more composure than he had expect∣ed; but he asked, with impatience, why he did not see his father and Adeline, and on being informed that indisposition with∣held them, his imagination seized on the worst possibility, and suggested that his fa∣ther was dead. It was a considerable time before Louis could convince him of the con∣trary, and that Adeline was not dangerously ill; when, however, he was assured that he should see them in the morning, he be∣came more tranquil. He desired his friend would not leave him that night. <Q REND="inline">"These are the last hours we can pass together,"</Q>
<PB N="271" REF="270"/>
added he; <Q REND="inline">"I cannot sleep! Stay with me and lighten their heavy moments. I have need of comfort, Louis. Young as I am, and held by such strong attach∣ments, I cannot quit the world with re∣signation. I know not how to credit those stories we hear of philosophic fortitude; wisdom cannot teach us cheerfully to re∣sign a good, and life in my circumstances is surely such."</Q></P>
<P>The night was passed in embarrassed conversation; sometimes interrupted by long fits of silence, and sometimes by the paroxysms of despair; and the morning of that day which was to lead Theodore to death at length dawned through the grates of his prison.</P>
<P>La Luc mean while passed a sleepless and dreadful night. He prayed for for∣titude and resignation both for himself and Theodore; but the pangs of nature were powerful in his heart, and not to be subdued. The idea of his lamented wife, and of what she would have suffer∣ed had she lived to witness the ignominious death which awaited her son, frequently oc∣curred to him.</P>
<P>It seemed as if a destiny had hung over the life of Theodore, for it is probable that the king might have granted the petition of the unhappy father, had it not happened
<PB N="272" REF="271"/>
that the Marquis de Montalt was present at court when the paper was presented. The appearance and singular distress of the peti∣tioner had interested the monarch, and, in∣stead of putting by the paper, he opened it. As he threw his eyes over it, observing that the criminal was of the Marquis de Montalt's regiment: he turned to him and inquired the nature of the offence for which the culprit was about to suffer. The answer was such as might have been expected from the Marquis, and the king was convinced that Theodore was not a proper object of mercy.</P>
<P>But to return to La Luc, who was call∣ed, according to his order, at a very early hour. Having passed some time in prayer, he went down to the parlour, where Louis, punctual to the moment, already waited to conduct him to the prison. He appeared calm and collected, but his countenance was impressed with a fixed despair that sensibly affected his young friend. While they wait∣ed for Adeline he spoke little, and seemed struggling to attain the fortitude necessary to support him through the approaching scene. Adeline not appearing, he at length sent to hasten her, and was told she had been ill, but was recovering. She had indeed passed a night of such agitation, that her frame had sunk under it, and she was now endea∣vouring to recover strength and composure
<PB N="273" REF="272"/>
sufficient to sustain her in this dreadful hour. Every moment that brought her nearer to it had increased her emotion, and the ap∣prehension of being prevented seeing Theo∣dore had alone enabled her to struggle against the united pressure of illness and grief.</P>
<P>She now, with Clara, joined La Luc, who advanced as they entered the room, and took a hand of each in silence. After some moments he proposed to go, and they step∣ped into a carriage which conveyed them to the gates of the prison. The crowd had al∣ready began to assemble there, and a confus∣ed murmur arose as the carriage moved for∣ward; it was a grievous sight to the friends of Theodore. Louis supported Adeline when she alighted, she was scarcely able to walk, and with trembling steps she followed La Luc, whom the keeper led towards that part of the prison where his son was confined. It was now eight o'clock, the sentence was not to be executed till twelve but a guard of soldiers was already placed in the court, and as this unhappy party passed along the narrow avenues they were met by several of∣ficers who had been to take a last farewell of Theodore. As they ascended the stairs that led to his apartment, La Luc's ear caught the clink of chains, and heard him walking above with a quick irregular step. The unhappy father, overcome by the mo∣ment
<PB N="274" REF="273"/>
which now pressed upon him, stopped, and was obliged to support himself by the bannister. Louis fearing the consequence of his grief might be fatal, shattered as his frame already was, would have gone for assistance, but he made a sign to him to stay. <Q REND="inline">"I am better;"</Q> said La Luc, <Q REND="inline">"O God! support me through this hour!"</Q> and in a few minutes he was able to proceed.</P>
<P>As the warder unlocked the door, the harsh grating of the key shocked Adeline, but in the next moment she was in the pre∣sence of Theodore, who sprung to meet her, and caught her in his arms before she sunk to the ground. As her head reclined on his shoulder, he again viewed that coun∣tenance so dear to him, which had so often lighted rapture in his heart, and which though pale and inanimate as it now was, awakened him to momentary delight. When at length she unclosed her eyes, she fixed them in long and mournful gaze upon Theo∣dore, who pressing her to his heart could answer her only with a smile of mingled ten∣derness and despair; the tears he endea∣voured to restrain trembled in his eyes, and he forgot for a time every thing but Adeline. La Luc, who had seated himself at the foot of the bed, seemed unconscious of what pass∣ed around him, and entirely absorbed in his own grief; but Clara, as she clasped the
<PB N="275" REF="274"/>
hand of her brother, and hung weeping on his arm, expressed aloud all the anguish of her heart, and at length recalled the atten∣tion of Adeline, who in a voice scarcely au∣dible entreated she would spare her father. Her words roused Theodore, and support∣ing Adeline to a chair, he turned to La Luc. <Q REND="inline">"My dear child!"</Q> said La Luc, grasping his hand and bursting into tears, <Q REND="inline">"My dear child!"</Q> They wept together. After a long interval of silence, he said, <Q REND="inline">"I thought I could have supported this hour, but I am old and feeble. God knows my ef∣forts for resignation, my faith in his good∣ness!"</Q></P>
<P>Theodore by a strong and sudden exerti∣on assumed a composed and firm counte∣nance, and endeavoured by every gentle argument to sooth and comfort his weeping friends. La Luc at length seemed to con∣quer his sufferings; drying his eyes, he said, <Q REND="inline">"My son, I ought to have set you a bet∣ter example, and practised the precepts of fortitude I have so often given you. But it is over; I know, and will per∣form, my duty."</Q> Adeline breathed a hea∣vy sigh, and continued to weep. <Q REND="inline">"Be com∣forted, my love, we part but for a time,"</Q> said Theodore as he kissed the tears from her cheek; and uniting her hand with that of his father's, he earnestly recommended her
<PB N="276" REF="275"/>
to his protection. <Q REND="inline">"Receive her,"</Q> added he, <Q REND="inline">"as the most precious legacy I can bequeath; consider her as your child. She will console you when I am gone, she will more than supply the loss of your son."</Q></P>
<P>La Luc assured him that he did now, and should continue to, regard Adeline as his daughter. During those afflicting hours he endeavoured to dissipate the terrors of approaching death by inspiring his son with religious confidence. His conver∣sation was pious, rational and consolatory: he spoke not from the cold dictates of the head, but from the feelings of a heart which had long loved and practised the pure precepts of christianity, and which now drew from them a comfort such as no∣thing earthly could bestow.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You are young, my son,"</Q> said he, <Q REND="inline">"and are yet innocent of any great crime; you may therefore look on death with∣out terror, for to the guilty only is his approach dreadful. I feel that I shall not long survive you, and I trust in a merci∣ful God that we shall meet in a state where sorrow never comes; <HI>where the Son of Righteousness shall come with heal∣ing in his wing!</HI>"</Q> As he spoke he looked up; the tears still trembled in his eyes, which beamed with meek yet servent devo∣tion,
<PB N="277" REF="276"/>
and his countenance glowed with the dignity of a superior being.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Let us not neglect the awful mo∣ments,"</Q> said La Luc, rising, <Q REND="inline">"let our united prayers ascend to Him who alone can comfort and support us!"</Q> They all knelt down, and he prayed with that sim∣ple and sublime eloquence which true piety inspires. When he rose he embraced his children separately, and when he came to Theodore he paused, gazed upon him with an earnest, mournful expression, and was for some time unable to speak. Theodore could not bear this; he drew his hand before his eyes, and vainly endeavoured to stifle the deep sobs which convulsed his frame. At length recovering his voice, he entreated his father would leave him. <Q REND="inline">"This mise∣ry is too much for us all,"</Q> said he, <Q REND="inline">"let us not prolong it. The time is now draw∣ing on—leave me to compose myself. The sharpness of death consists in part∣ing with those who are dear to us; when that is passed, death is disarmed."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I will not leave you, my son,"</Q> replied La Luc, <Q REND="inline">"My poor girls shall go, but for me, I will be with you in your last mo∣ments."</Q> Theodore felt that this would be too much for them both, and urged eve∣ry argument which reason could suggest to prevail with his father to relinquish his de∣sign.
<PB N="278" REF="277"/>
But he remained firm in his deter∣mination. <Q REND="inline">"I will not suffer a selfish con∣sideration of the pain I may endure,"</Q> said La Luc, <Q REND="inline">"to tempt me to desert my child when he will most require my sup∣port. It is my duty to attend you, and nothing shall withhold me."</Q></P>
<P>Theodore seized on the words of La Luc—<Q REND="inline">"As you would that I should be supported in my last hour,"</Q> said he, <Q REND="inline">"I en∣treat that you will not be witness of it. Your presence, my dear father, would subdue all my fortitude—would destroy what little composure I may otherwise be able to attain. Add not to my sufferings the view of your distress, but leave me to forget, if possible, the dear parent I must quit for ever."</Q> His tears flowed anew. La Luc continued to gaze on him in silent agony; at length he said, <Q REND="inline">"Well, be it so. If indeed my presence would distress you, I will not go."</Q> His voice was broken and interrupted. After a pause of some moments he again embraced Theo∣dore—<Q REND="inline">"We must part,"</Q> said he, <Q REND="inline">"we <HI>must</HI> part, but it is only for a time—we shall soon be re-united in a higher world!—O God! thou seest my heart—thou seest all its feelings in this bit∣ter hour!"—</Q>Grief again overcame him. He pressed Theodore in his arms; and at
<PB N="279" REF="278"/>
length, seeming to summon all his fortitude, he again said, <Q REND="inline">"We <HI>must</HI> part—Oh! my son, farewell for ever in this world!—The mercy of Almighty God support and bless you!"</Q></P>
<P>He turned away to leave the prison, but, quite worn out with grief, sunk into a chair near the door he would have opened. The∣odore gazed, with a distracted counte∣nance, alternately on his father, on Clara, and on Adeline, whom he pressed to his throbbing heart, and their tears flowed to∣gether. <Q REND="inline">"And do I then,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"for the last time look upon that countenance!—Shall I never—never more behold it?—O! exquisite misery! Yet once again—once more,"</Q> continued he, press∣ing her cheek, but it was insensible and cold as marble.</P>
<P>Louis, who had left the room soon after La Luc arrived, that his presence might not interrupt their farewell grief, now returned. Adeline raised her head, and perceiving who entered, it again sunk on the bosom of Theodore.</P>
<P>Louis appeared much agitated. La Luc arose. <Q REND="inline">"We must go,"</Q> said he: <Q REND="inline">"Adeline, my love, exert yourself—Clara—my children, let us depart.—Yet one last—last embrace, and then!"—</Q>Louis advanced and took his hand; <Q REND="inline">"My
<PB N="280" REF="279"/>
dear Sir, I have something to say; yet I fear to tell it."—</Q><Q REND="inline">"What do you mean?"</Q> said La Luc, with quickness: <Q REND="inline">"No new misfortune can have power to afflict me at this moment. Do not fear to speak."—</Q><Q REND="inline">"I rejoice that I cannot put you to the proof,"</Q> replied Louis; <Q REND="inline">"I have seen you sustain the most trying affliction with fortitude. Can you sup∣port the transports of hope?"—</Q>La Luc gazed eagerly on Louis—<Q REND="inline">"Speak!"</Q> said he, in a faint voice. Adeline raised her head, and, trembling between hope and fear, looked at Louis as if she would have search∣ed his soul. He smiled cheerfully upon her. <Q REND="inline">"Is it—O! is it possible!"</Q> she exclaim∣ed, suddenly re-animated—<Q REND="inline">"He lives! He lives!"—</Q>She said no more, but ran to La Luc, who sunk sainting in his chair, while Theodore and Clara with one voice called on Louis to relieve them from the tortures of suspence.</P>
<P>He proceeded to inform them that he had obtained from the commanding officer a res∣pite for Theodore till the king's farther pleasure could be known, and this in con∣sequence of a letter received that morning from his mother, Madame De la Motte, in which she mentioned some very extraor∣dinary circumstances that had appeared in the course of a trial lately conducted at Paris,
<PB N="281" REF="280"/>
and which so materially affected the cha∣racter of the Marquis de Montalt as to render it possible a pardon might be obtained for Theodore.</P>
<P>These words darted with the rapidity of lightning upon the hearts of his hearers. La Luc revived, and that prison so lately the scene of de2spair now echoed only to the voices of gratitude and gladness. La Luc, raising his clasped hands to Heaven, said, <Q REND="inline">"Great God! support me in this mo∣ment, as thou hast already supported me!—If my son lives, I die in peace."</Q></P>
<P>He embraced Theodore, and remem∣bering the anguish of his last embrace, tears of thankfulness and joy flowed to the con∣trast. So powerful indeed was the effect of this temporary reprieve, and of the hope it introduced, that if an absolute pardon had been obtained, it could scarcely for the moment have diffused a more lively joy. But when the first emotions were subsided, the uncertainty of Theodore's fate once more appeared. Adeline forbore to express this, but Clara without scruple lamented the possibility that her brother might yet be taken from them, and all their joy be turn∣ed to sorrow. A look from Adeline checked her. Joy was, however, so much the pre∣dominant feeling of the present moment, that the shade which reflection threw upon
<PB N="282" REF="281"/>
their hopes passed away like the cloud that is dispelled by the strength of the sun beam; and Louis alone was pensive and abstract∣ed.</P>
<P>When they were sufficiently composed, he informed them that the contents of Ma∣dame De la Motte's letter obliged him to set out for Paris immediately; and that the intelligence he had to communicate inti∣mately concerned Adeline, who would un∣doubtedly judge it necessary to go thither also as soon as her health would permit. He then read to his impatient auditors such passages in the letter as were necessary to explain his meaning; but as Madame De la Motte had omitted to mention some cir∣cumstances of importance to be understood, the following is a relation of the occurrences that had lately happened at Paris.</P>
<P>It may be remembered, that on the first day of his trial, La Motte, in passing from the courts to his prison, saw a person whose features, though imperfectly seen through the dusk, he thought he recollected; and that this same person, after inquiring the name of La Motte, desired to be admitted to him. On the following day the warder complied with his request, and the surprise of La Motte may be imagined when, in the stronger light of his apartment, he distin∣guished the countenance of the man from
<PB N="283" REF="282"/>
whose hands he had formerly received Ade∣line.</P>
<P>On observing Madame De la Motte in the room, he said, he had something of consequence to impart, and desired to be left alone with the prisoner. When she was gone, he told De la Motte that he under∣stood he was confined at the suit of the Marquis de Montalt. La Motte assented.—<Q REND="inline">"I know him for a villain,"</Q> said the stranger boldly.—<Q REND="inline">"Your case is despe∣rate. Do you wish for life?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Need the question be asked!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Your trial, I understand, proceeds to∣morrow. I am now under confinement in this place for debt; but if you can obtain leave for me to go with you into the courts, and a condition from the judge that what I reveal shall not crimi∣nate myself, I will make discoveries that shall confound that same Marquis; I will prove him a villain; and it shall then be judged how far his word ought to be taken against you."</Q></P>
<P>La Motte, whose interest was now strong∣ly excited, desired he would explain him∣self; and the man proceeded to relate a long history of the misfortunes and conse∣quent poverty which had tempted him to become subservient to the schemes of the Marquis, till he suddenly checked himself,

and said. <Q REND="inline">"When I obtain from the court the promise I require, I will explain my∣self fully; till then I cannot say more on the subject."</Q></P>
<P>La Motte could not forbear expressing a doubt of his sincerity, and a curiosity con∣cerning the motive that had induced him to become the Marquis's accuser.—<Q REND="inline">"As to my motive, it is a very natural one,"</Q> replied the man: <Q REND="inline">"it is no easy matter to receive ill usage without resenting it, par∣ticularly from a villain whom you have served."—</Q>La Motte, for his own sake, en∣deavoured to check the vehemence with which this was uttered. <Q REND="inline">"I care not who hears me,"</Q> continued the stranger, but at the same time he lowered his voice; <Q REND="inline">"I repeat it—the Marquis has used me ill—I have kept his secret long enough. He does not think it worth while to secure my silence, or he would relieve my necessities. I am in prison for debt, and have applied to him for relief: since he does not chuse to give it, let him take the consequence. I warrant he shall soon repent that he has provoked me, and 'tis fit he should."</Q></P>
<P>The doubts of La Motte were now dis∣sipated; the prospect of life again opened upon him, and he assured Du Bosse, (which was the stranger's name) with much warmth, that he would commission his Advocate to
<PB N="285" REF="284"/>
do all in his power to obtain leave for his appearance on the trial, and to procure the necessary condition. After some farther conversation they parted.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>LEAVE was at length granted for the appearance of Du Bosse, with a promise that his words should not criminate him, and he accompanied La Motte into court.</P>
<P>The confusion of the Marquis de Mon∣talt on perceiving this man was observ∣ed by many persons present, and particu∣larly by La Motte, who drew from this circumstance a favourable presage for him∣self.</P>
<P>When Du Bosse was called upon, he in∣formed the court, that on the night of the twenty-first of April in the preced∣ing year, one Jean d'Aunoy, a man he had known many years, came to his lodging. After they had discoursed for some time on their circumstances, d'Au∣noy
<PB N="286" REF="285"/>
said he knew a way by which du Bosse might change all his poverty to riches, but that he would not say more till he was certain he would be willing to follow it. The distressed state in which du Bosse then was made him anxious to learn the means which would bring him relief; he eagerly inquired what his friend meant, and after some time d'Aunoy explained himself. He said he was em∣ployed by a nobleman, (who he after∣wards told du Bosse was the Marquis de Montalt) to carry off a young gir from a convent, and that she was to be taken to a house at a few leagues distant from Paris. <Q REND="inline">"I knew the house he described well,"</Q> said du Bosse, <Q REND="inline">"for I had been there many times with d'Aunoy, who lived there to avoid his creditors, though he often passed his nights at Paris."</Q> He would not tell me more of the scheme, but said he should want assistants, and if I and my brother, who is since dead, would join him, his em∣ployer would grudge no money, and we should be well rewarded. I desired him again to tell me more of the plan, but he was obstinate, and after I had told him I would consider of what he said, and speak to my brother, he went away.</P>
<P><PB N="287" REF="286"/>
<Q REND="inline">"When he called the next night for his answer, my brother and I agreed to engage, and accordingly we went home with him. He then told us that the young lady he was to bring thither was a natural daughter of the Marquis de Montalt, and of a nun belonging to a convent of Ursalines; that his wise had received the child immedi∣ately on its birth, and had been al∣lowed a handsome annuity to bring it up as her own, which she had done till her death. The child was then placed in a convent and designed for the veil; but when she was of an age to receive the vows, she had steadily persisted in refusing them. This cir∣cumstance had so much exasperated the Marquis, that in his rage he or∣dered, that if she persisted in her ob∣stinacy she should be removed from the convent, and got rid of any way, since if she lived in the world her birth might be discovered, and in consequence of this, her mother, for whom he had yet a regard, would be condemned to expiate her crime by a terrible death."</Q></P>
<P>Du Bosse was interrupted in his narrative by the council of the Marquis, who contended that the circumstances alledg∣ed
<PB N="288" REF="287"/>
tending to criminate his client, the proceeding was both irrelevant and illegal. He was answered that it was not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>elevant, and therefore not illegal, for that the cir∣cumstances which threw light upon the character of the Marquis, affected his evidence against La Motte. Du Bosse was suffered to proceed.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"D'AUnoy then said that the Marquis had ordered him to dispatch her, but that as he had been used to see her from her infancy, he could not find in his heart to do it, and wrote to tell him so. The Marquis then com∣manded him to find those who would, and this was the business for which he wanted us. My brother and I were not so wicked as this came to, and so we told d'Aunoy, and I could not help asking why the Marquis resolved to murder his own child rather than expose her mother to the risque of suffering death. He said the Marquis had never seen his child, and that therefore it could not be supposed he felt much kindness towards it, and still less that he could love it better than he loved its mother."</Q></P>
<P>Du Bosse proceeded to relate how much he and his brother had endeavoured to soften the heart of d'Aunoy towards the
<PB N="289" REF="288"/>
Marquis's daughter, and that they pre∣vailed with him to write again and plead for her. D'Aunoy went to Paris to await the answer, leaving them and the young girl at the house on the heath, where the former had consented to re∣main, seemingly for the purpose of exe∣cuting the orders they might receive, but really with a design to save the unhappy victim from the sacrifice.</P>
<P>It is probable that Du Bosse, in this instance, gave a false account of his mo∣tive, since if he was really guilty of an in∣tention so atrocious as that of murder, he would naturally endeavour to conceal it. However this might be, he affirmed that on the night of the twenty-sixth of April, he received an order from d'Aunoy for the destruction of the girl whom he had afterwards delivered into the hands of La Motte.</P>
<P>La Motte listened to this relation in astonishment; when he knew that Adeline was the daughter of the Marquis, and remembered the crime to which he had once devoted her, his frame thrilled with horror. He now took up the story, and added an account of what had passed at the Abbey between the Marquis and himself concerning a design of the for∣mer upon the life of Adeline; and urged,
<PB N="290" REF="289"/>
as a proof of the present prosecution ori∣ginating in malice, that it had com∣menced immediately after he had effect∣ed her escape from the Marquis. He concluded, however, with saying, that as the Marquis had immediately sent his people in pursuit of her, it was possible she might yet have fallen a victim to his vengeance.</P>
<P>Here the Marquis's council again in∣terfered, and their objections were again overruled by the court. The uncommon degree of emotion which his countenance betrayed during the narrations of Du Bosse, and De la Motte, was generally observed. The court suspended the sen∣tence of the latter, ordered that the Marquis should be put under immediate arrest, and that Adeline (the name given by her foster mother), and Jean d'Aunoy should be sought for.</P>
<P>The Marquis was accordingly seized at the suit of the crown, and put under confinement till Adeline should appear, or proof could be obtained that she died by his order, and till d'Aunoy should confirm or destroy the evidence of De la Motte.</P>
<P>Madame, who at length obtained in∣telligence of her son's res<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dence from the town where he was formerly stationed, had
<PB N="291" REF="290"/>
acquainted him with his father's situation, and the proceedings of the trial; and as she believed that Adeline, if she had been so fortunate as to escape the Mar∣quis's pursuit, was still in Savoy, she de∣sired Louis would obtain leave of absence, and bring her to Paris, where her imme∣diate presence was requisite to substan∣tiate the evidence, and probably to save the life of La Motte.</P>
<P>On the receipt of her letter, which happened on the morning appointed for the execution of Theodore, Louis went immediately to the commanding officer to petition for a respite till the king's fur∣ther pleasure should be known. He founded his plea on the arrest of the Marquis, and shewed the letter he had just received. The commanding officer readily granted a reprieve, and Louis, who, on the arrival of this letter, had forborne to communicate its contents to Theodore, lest it should torture him with false hope, now hastened to him with this comfortable news.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>ON learning the purpose of Madame de la Motte's letter, Adeline saw the ne∣cessity of her immediate departure for Paris. The life of La Motte, who had more than saved her's, the life, perhaps, of her beloved Theodore, depended on the testimony she should give. And she who had so lately been sinking under the influence of illness and despair, who could scarcely raise her languid head, or speak but in the faintest accents, now re∣animated with hope, and invigorated by a sense of the importance of the business before her, prepared to perform a rapid journey of some hundred miles.</P>
<P>Theodore tenderly intreated that she would so far consider her health as to delay this journey for a few days; but with a smile of enchanting tenderness she assured him, that she was now too happy to be ill, and that the same cause which would confirm her happiness would con∣firm her health. So strong was the effect of hope upon her mind now, that it suc∣ceeded
<PB N="293" REF="292"/>
to the misery of despair, that it overcame the shock she suffered on be∣lieving herself a daughter of the Mar∣quis, and every other painful reflection. She did not even foresee the obstacle that circumstance might produce to her union with Theodore, should he at last be permitted to live.</P>
<P>It was settled that she should set off for Paris in a few hours with Louis, and at∣tended by Peter. These hours were passed by La Luc and his family in the prison.</P>
<P>When the time of her departure arrived, the spirits of Adeline again forsook her, and the illusions of joy disappeared. She no longer beheld Theodore as one respited from death, but took leave of him with a mournful pre-sentiment that she should see him no more. So strongly was this presage impressed upon her mind, that it was long before she could summon resolution to bid him farewell; and when she had done so, and even left the apartment, she returned to take of him a last look. As she was once more quitting the room, her melancholy imagination represented Theodore at the place of execution, pale and convulsed in death; she again turned her lingering eyes upon him; but fancy affected her sense, for she thought as she now gazed
<PB N="294" REF="293"/>
that his countenance changed, and assumed a ghastly hue. All her resolution vanished and such was the anguish of her heart, that she resolved to defer her journey till the morrow, though she must by this means lose the pro∣tection of Louis, whose impatience to meet his father would not fuffer the delay. The triumph of passion, however, was transient; soothed by the indulgence she promised her∣self, her grief subsided, reason resumed its influence; she again saw the necessity of her immediate departure, and recollected sufficient resolution to submit. La Luc would have accompanied her for the pur∣pose of again soliciting the King in behalf of his son, had not the extreme weakness and lassitude to which he was reduced made travelling impracticable.</P>
<P>At length, Adeline, with a heavy heart quitted Theodore, notwithstanding his en∣treaties, that she would not undertake the journey in her present weak state, and was accompanied by Clara and La Luc to the inn. The former parted from her friend with many tears, and much anxiety for her welfare, but under a hope of soon meeting again. Should a pardon be granted to Theodore, La Luc designed to fetch Adeline from Paris; but should this be refused, she was to return with Peter. He bade her adieu with a father's kindness, which she
<PB N="295" REF="294"/>
repaid with a filial affection, and in her last words conjured him to attend to the recovery of his health: the languid smile he assumed seemed to express that her solicitude was vain, and that he thought his health past recovery.</P>
<P>Thus Adeline quitted the friends so justly dear to her, and so lately found, for Paris, where she was a stranger, almost without protection, and compelled to meet a father who had pursued her with the utmost cruel∣ty, in a public court of justice. The car∣riage in leaving Vaceau passed by the prison; she threw an eager look towards it as she passed; its heavy black walls, and narrow-grated windows, seemed to frown upon her hopes—but Theodore was there, and leaning from the window, she con∣tinued to gaze upon it till an abrupt turning in the street concealed it from her view. She then sunk back in the carriage, and yielding to the melancholy of her heart, wept in silence. Louis was not disposed to interrupt it; his thoughts were anxi∣ously employed on his father's situation, and the travellers proceeded many miles without exchanging a word.</P>
<P>At Paris, whither we shall now return, the search after Jean d'Aunoy was pro∣secuted without success. The house on the heath, described by du Bosse, was
<PB N="296" REF="295"/>
found uninhabited, and to the places of his usual resort in the city, where the officers of the police awaited him, he no longer came. It even appeared doubtful whether he was living, for he had absented himself from the houses of his customary rendezvous some time be∣fore the trial of La Motte; it was there∣fore certain that his absence was not oc∣casioned by any thing which had passed in the courts.</P>
<P>In the solitude of his confinement the Marquis de Montalt had leisure to reflect on the past, and to repent of his crimes; but reflection and repentance formed as yet no part of his disposition. He turned with impatience from recollections which produced only pain, and looked forward to the future with an endeavour to avert the disgrace and punishment which he saw impending. The elegance of his manners had so effectually veiled the depravity of his heart, that he was a fa∣vourite with his Sovereign; and on this circumstance he rested his hope of secu∣rity. He, however, severely repented that he had indulged the hasty spirit of revenge which had urged him to the pro∣secution of La Motte, and had thus un∣expectedly involved him in a situation dangerous—if not fatal—since if Adeline
<PB N="297" REF="296"/>
could not be found he would be concluded guilty of her death. But the appearance of d'Aunoy was the circumstance he most dreaded; and to oppose the possibility of this, he employed secret emissaries to discover his retreat, and to bribe him to his interest. These were, however, as unsuccessful in their research as the officers of police, and the Marquis at length began to hope the man was really dead.</P>
<P>La Motte mean while awaited with trembling impatience the arrival of his son, when he should be relieved, in some degree, from his uncertainty con∣cerning Adeline. On his appearance he rested his only hope of life, since the evi∣dence against him would lose much of its validity from the confirmation she would give of the bad character of his prosecu∣tor; and if the Parliament even con∣demned La Motte, the clemency of the King might yet op rate in his favour.</P>
<P>Adeline arrived at Paris after a jour∣ney of several days, during which she was chiefly supported by the delicate at∣tentions of Louis, whom she pitied and esteemed, though she could not love. She was immediately visited at the hotel by Madame La Motte: the meeting was affecting on both sides. A sense of her past conduct excited in the latter an em∣barrassment
<PB N="298" REF="297"/>
which the delicacy and good∣ness of Adeline would willingly have spared her; but the pardon solicited was given with so much sincerity, that Madame gra∣dually became composed and re-assured. This forgiveness, however, could not have been thus easily granted, had Adeline be∣lieved her former conduct was voluntary; a conviction of the restraint and terror under which Madame had acted, alone induced her to excuse the past. In this first meeting they forbore dwelling on particular subjects; Madame La Motte proposed that Adeline should remove from the hotel to her lodgings near the Chatelet, and Adeline, for whom a residence at a public hotel was very impro∣per, gladly accepted the offer.</P>
<P>Madame there gave her a circumstantial account of La Motte's situation, and con∣cluded with saying, that as the sentence of her husband had been suspended till some certainty could be obtained concerning the late criminal designs of the Marquis, and as Adeline could confirm the chief part of La Motte's testimony, it was probable that now she was arrived the Court would pro∣ceed immediately. She now learnt the full extent of her obligation to La Motte; for she was till now ignorant that when he sent her from the forest he saved her from death. Her horror of the Marquis, whom she could
<PB N="299" REF="298"/>
not bear to consider as her father, and her gratitude to her deliverer, redoubled, and she became impatient to give the testimony so necessary to the hopes of her preserver. Madame then said, she believed it was not too late to gain admittance that night to the Chatelet; and as she knew how anxiously her husband wished to see Adeline, she en∣treated her consent to go thither. Adeline, though much harrassed and fatigued, com∣plied. When Louis returned from M. Nemcur's, his father's advocate, whom he had hastened to inform of her arrival, they all set out for the Chatelet. The view of the prison into which they were now admit∣ted so forcibly recalled to Adeline's mind the situation of Theodore, that she with difficul∣ty supported herself to the apartment of La Motte. When he saw her, a gleam of joy passed over his countenance; but again relapsing into despondency, he looked mournfully at her, and then at Louis, and groaned deeply. Adeline, in whom all remembrance of his former cruelty was lost in his subsequent kindness, expressed her thankfulness for the life he had preserved, and her anxiety to serve him, in warm and repeated terms. But her gratitude evidently distressed him; instead of reconciling him to himself, it seemed to awaken a remem∣brance of the guilty designs he had once
<PB N="300" REF="299"/>
assisted, and to strike the pangs of conscience deeper in his heart. Endeavouring to conceal his emotions, he entered on the subject of his present danger, and informed Adeline what testimony would be required of her on the trial. After above an hour's conversation with La Motte, she returned to the lodgings of Madame, where, languid and ill, she withdrew to her chamber, and tried to obliviate her anxieties in sleep.</P>
<P>The Parliament which conducted the trial re-assembled in a few days after the arrival of Adeline, and the two remain∣ing witnesses of the Marquis, on whom he now rested his cause against La Motte, appeared. She was led trembling into the Court, where almost the first object that met her eyes was the Marquis de Montalt, whom she now beheld with an emotion en∣tirely new to her, and which was strongly tinctured with horror. When du Bosse saw her, he immediately swore to her identity; his testimony was confirmed by her manner; for on perceiving him she grew pale, and a universal tremor seized her. Jean d'Aunoy could no where be found, and La Motte was thus deprived of an evidence which es∣sentially affected his interest. Adeline, when called upon, gave her little narrative with clearness and precision; and Peter, who had conveyed her from the Abbey,
<PB N="301" REF="300"/>
supported the testimony she offered. The evidence produced was sufficient to criminate the Marquis of the intention of murder, in the minds of most people present; but it was not sufficient to affect the testimony of his two last witnesses, who positively swore to the commission of the robbery, and to the person of La Motte, on whom sentence of death was accordingly pronounced. On re∣ceiving this sentence the unhappy criminal fainted, and the compassion of the assembly, whose feelings had been unusually interested in the decision, was expressed in a general groan.</P>
<P>Their attention was quickly called to a new object—it was Jean d'Aunoy who now entered the Court. But his evidence, if it could ever, indeed, have been the means of saving La Motte, came too late. He was re-conducted to prison; but Ade∣line, who, extremely shocked by his sen∣tence, was much indisposed, received or∣ders to remain in the Court during the ex∣amination of d'Aunoy. This man had been at length found in the prison of a provincial town, where some of his creditors had thrown him, and from which even the mo∣ney which the Marquis had remitted to him for the purpose of satisfying the craving importunities of du Bosse, had been in∣sufficient to release him. Meanwhile the
<PB N="302" REF="301"/>
revenge of the latter had been roused against the Marquis by an imaginary neglect, and the money which was designed to relieve his necessities was spent by d'Aunoy in riotous luxury.</P>
<P>He was confronted with Adeline and with du Bosse, and ordered to confess all he knew concerning this mysterious affair, or to un∣dergo the torture. D'Aunoy, who was ignorant how far the suspicions concerning the Marquis extended, and who was con∣scious that his own words might condemn him, remained for some time obstinately si∣lent; but when the <HI>question</HI> was administer∣ed his resolution gave way, and he confess∣ed a crime of which he had not even been suspected.</P>
<P>It appeared, that in the year 1642 d'Au∣noy, together with one Jacques Martigny, and Francis Balliere, had way-laid, and seized, Henry Marquis de Montalt, half∣brother to Phillipe; and after having rob∣bed him, and bound his servant to a tree, according to the orders they had received, they conveyed him to the Abbey of St. Clair, in the distant forest of Fontangville. Here he was confined for some time till farther directions were received from Phillipe de Montalt, the present Marquis, who was then on his estates in a northern province of France. These orders were for death,
<PB N="303" REF="302"/>
and the unfortunate Henry was assassinated in his chamber in the third week of his con∣finement at the Abbey.</P>
<P>On hearing this Adeline grew faint; she remembered the M S. she had found, together with the extraordinary circum∣stances that had attended the discovery; every nerve thrilled with horror, and raising her eyes she saw the countenance of the Marquis overspread with the livid paleness of guilt. She endeavoured, how∣ever, to arrest her fleeting spirits while the man proceeded in his confession.</P>
<P>When the murder was perpetrated, d'Au∣noy had returned to his employer, who gave him the reward agreed upon, and in a few months after delivered into his hands the infant daughter of the late Marquis, whom he conveyed to a distant part of the kingdom, where, assuming the name of St. Pierre, he brought her up as his own child, receiving from the present Mar∣quis a considerable annuity for his se∣crecy.</P>
<P>Adeline, no longer able to struggle with the tumult of emotions that now rushed upon her heart, uttered a deep sigh and fainted away. She was carried from the Court, and, when the confusion occasioned by this circumstance subsided, Jean d'Au∣noy went on. He related, that on the
<PB N="304" REF="303"/>
death of his wife, Adeline was placed in a convent, from whence she was afterwards re∣moved to another, where the Marquis had destined her to receive the vows. That her determined rejection of them had occa∣sioned him to resolve upon her death, and that she had accordingly been removed to the house on the health. D'Aunoy added, that by the Marquis's order he had misled du Bosse with a false story of her birth. Hav∣ing after some time discovered that his com∣rades had deceived him concerning her death, d'Aunoy separated from them in enmity; but they unanimously determined to conceal her escape from the Marquis, that they might enjoy the recompence of their supposed crime. Some months subsequent to this period, however, d'Aunoy received a letter from the Marquis, charging him with the truth, and promising him a large reward if he would confess where he had placed Adeline. In consequence of this letter he acknowledged that she had been given into the hands of a stranger; but who he was, or where he lived, was not known.</P>
<P>Upon these depositions Phillipe de Mon∣talt was committed to take his trial for the murder of Henry, his brother; d'Aunoy was thrown into a dungeon of the Chate∣let, and du Bosse was bound to appear as evidence.</P>
<P><PB N="305" REF="304"/>
The feelings of the Marquis, who, in a prosecution stimulated by revenge, had thus unexpectedly exposed his crimes to the public eye, and betrayed himself to justice, can only be imagined. The passions which had tempted him to the commission of a crime so horrid as that of murder—and what, if possible, heightened its atrocity, the murder of one connected with him by the ties of blood, and by habits of even infan∣tine association—the passions which had stimulated him to so monstrous a deed were ambition, and the love of pleasure. The first was more immediately gratified by the title of his brother; the latter by the riches which would enable him to indulge his vo∣luptuous inclinations.</P>
<P>The late Marquis de Montalt, the father of Adeline, received from his ancestors a patrimony very inadequate to support the splendour of his rank; but he had married the heiress of an illustrious family, whose fortune amply supplied the deficiency of his own. He had the misfortune to lose her, for she was amiable and beautiful, soon after the birth of a daughter, and it was then that the present Marquis formed the diabolical design of destroying his brother. The con∣trast of their characters prevented that cor∣dial regard between them which their near relationship seemed to demand. Henry was
<PB N="306" REF="305"/>
benevolent, mild, and contemplative. In his heart reigned the love of virtue; in his manners the strictness of justness was tem∣pered, not weakened, by mercy; his mind was enlarged by science, and adorned by elegant literature. The character of Phil∣lipe has been already delineated in his ac∣tions; its nicer shades were blended with some shining tints; but these served only to render more striking by contrast the general darkness of the portrait.</P>
<P>He had married a lady, who, by the death of her brother, inherited considerable estates, of which the Abbey of St. Clair, and the villa on the borders of the forest of Fontangville, were the chief. His passion for magnificence and dissipation, however, soon involved him in difficulties, and point∣ed out to him the conveniency of possessing his brother's wealth. His brother and his infant daughter only stood between him and his wishes; how he removed the father has been already related; why he did not em∣ploy the same means to secure the child, seems somewhat surprizing, unless we ad∣mit that a destiny hung over him on this occasion, and that she was suffered to live as an instrument to punish the murderer of her parent. When a retrospect is taken of the vicissitudes and dangers to which she had been exposed from her earliest infancy, it ap∣pears
<PB N="307" REF="306"/>
as if her preservation was the effect of something more than human policy, and affords a striking instance that Justice, how∣ever long delayed, will overtake the guilty.</P>
<P>While the late unhappy Marquis was suffering at the Abbey, his brother, who, to avoid suspicion, remained in the north of France, delayed the execution of his horrid purpose from a timidity natural to a mind not yet inured to enormous guilt. Before he dared to deliver his final orders he waited to know whether the story he con∣trived to propagate of his brother's death would veil his crime from suspicion. It suc∣ceeded but too well; for the servant, whose life had been spared that he might relate the tale, naturally enough concluded that his Lord had been murdered by Banditti; and the peasant, who a few hours after found the servant wounded, bleeding, and bound to a tree, and knew also that this spot was infested by robbers, as naturally believed him, and spread the report accordingly.</P>
<P>From this period the Marquis, to whom the Abbey of St. Clair belonged in right of his wife, visited it only twice, and that at distant times, till after an interval of several years he accidentally found La Motte its in∣habitant. He resided at Paris, and on his estate in the north, except that once a year he usually passed a month at his delightful
<PB N="308" REF="307"/>
villa on the borders of the forest. In the busy scenes of the Court, and in the dissipa∣tions of pleasure, he tried to lose the remem∣brance of his guilt; but there were times when the voice of conscience would be heard, though it was soon again lost in the tumult of the world.</P>
<P>It is probable, that on the night of his abrupt departure from the Abbey, the soli∣tary silence and gloom of the hour, in a place which had been the scene of his former crime, called up the remembrance of his brother with a force too powerful for fancy, and awakened horrors which compelled him to quit the polluted spot. If it was so, it is however certain that the spectres of con∣science vanished with the darkness; for on the following day he returned to the Abbey, though it may be observed, he never at∣tempted to pass another night there. But though terror was roused for a transient mo∣ment, neither pity or repentance succeeded, since when the discovery of Adeline's birth excited apprehension for his own life, he did not hesitate to repeat the crime, and would again have stained his soul with hu∣man blood. This discovery was effected by means of a seal, bearing the arms of her mother's family, which was impressed on the note his servant had found, and had de∣livered to him at Caux. It may be remem∣bered, that having read this note, he was
<PB N="309" REF="308"/>
throwing it from him in the fury of jea∣lousy; but that after examining it again, it was carefully deposited in his pocket-book. The violent agitation which a suspicion of this terrible truth occasioned deprived him for a while of all power to act. When he was well enough to write he dispatched a letter to d'Aunoy, the purport of which has been already mentioned. From d'Aunoy he received the confirmation of his fears. Knowing that his life must pay the forfei∣ture of his crime, should Adeline ever obtain a knowledge of her birth, and not daring again to confide in the secrecy of a man who had once deceived him, he resolved, after some deliberation, on her death. He im∣mediately set out for the Abbey, and gave those directions concerning her which terror for his own safety, still more than a desire of retaining her estates, suggested.</P>
<P>As the history of the seal which revealed the birth of Adeline is rather remarkable, it may not be amiss to mention, that it was stolen from the Marquis, together with a gold watch, by Jean d'Aunoy: the watch was soon disposed of, but the seal had been kept as a pretty trinket by his wife, and at her death went with Adeline among her clothes to the convent. Adeline had care∣fully preserved it, because it had once be∣longed to the woman whom she believed to have been her mother.</P>

<P>WE now return to the course of the nar∣rative, and to Adeline, who was carried from the court to the lodging of Madame De la Motte. Madame was, however, at the Chatelet with her husband, suffering all the distress which the sentence pronounced against him might be supposed to inflict. The feeble frame of Adeline, so long har∣rassed by grief and fatigue, almost sunk un∣der the agitation which the discovery of her birth excited. Her feelings on this occasion were too complex to be analysed. From an orphan, subsisting on the bounty of others, without family, with few friends, and pur∣sued by a cruel and powerful enemy, she saw herself suddenly transformed to the daughter of an illustrious house, and the heiress of im∣mense wealth. But she learned also that her father had been murdered—murdered in the prime of his days—murdered by means of his brother, against whom she must now appear, and in punishing the destroyer of her parent doom her uncle to death.</P>
<P>When she remembered the manuscript so fingularly found, and considered that when she wept for the sufferings it described, her tears had flowed for those of her father, her emotion cannot easily be imagined. The
<PB N="311" REF="310"/>
circumstances attending the discovery of these and papers no longer appeared to be a work of chance, but of a Power whose designs are great and just. <Q REND="inline">"O my father!"</Q> she would exclaim, <Q REND="inline">"your last wish is fulfilled—the pitying heart you wished might trace your suf∣ferings shall avenge them."</Q></P>
<P>On the return of Madame La Motte Adeline endeavoured, as usual, to sup∣press her own emotions, that she might sooth the affliction of her friend. She related what had passed in the courts af∣ter the departure of La Motte, and thus excited, even in the sorrowful heart of Madame, a momentary gleam of satis∣faction. Adeline determined to recover, if possible, the manuscript. On inquiry she learned that La Motte, in the con∣fusion of his departure, had left it among other things at the Abbey. This cir∣cumstance much distressed her, the more so because she believed its appearance might be of importance on the approach∣ing trial: she determined, however, if she should recover her rights, to have the manuscript sought for.</P>
<P>In the evening Louis joined this mournful party: he came immediately from his father, whom he left more tran∣quil than he had been since the fatal sen∣tence was pronounced. After a silent
<PB N="312" REF="311"/>
and melancholy supper they separated for the night, and Adeline, in the soli∣tude of her chamber, had leisure to me∣ditate on the discoveries of this eventful day. The sufferings of her dead father, such as she had read them recorded by his <HI>own hand,</HI> pressed most forcibly to her thoughts. The narrative had for∣merly so much affected her heart, and interested her imagination, that her me∣mory now faithfully reflected each parti∣cular circumstance there disclosed. But when she considered that she had been in the very chamber where her parent had suffered, where even his life had been sacrificed, and that she had probably seen the very dagger, seen it stained with rust, the rust of blood! by which he had fallen, the anguish and horror of her mind defied all controul.</P>
<P>On the following day Adeline received orders to prepare for the prosecution of the Marquis de Montalt, which was to commence as soon as the requisite wit∣nesses could be collected. Among these were the Abbess of the Convent, who had received her from the hands of d'Aunoy; Madame La Motte, who was present when Du Bosse compelled her husband to receive Adeline; and Peter, who had not only been witness to this circumstance, but who had conveyed her
<PB N="313" REF="312"/>
from the Abbey that she might escape the designs of the Marquis. La Motte, and Theodore La Luc, were incapaci∣tated by the sentence of the law from appearing on the trial.</P>
<P>When La Motte was informed of the discovery of Adeline's birth, and that her father had been murdered at the Abbey of St. Clair, he instantly remembred, and mentioned to his wife, the skeleton he found in the stone room leading to the subterranean cells. Neither of them doubted, from the situation in which it lay, hid in a chest in an obscure room strongly guarded, that La Motte had seen the remains of the late Marquis. Madame, however, determined not to shock Adeline with the mention of this circumstance till it should be necessary to declare it on the trial.</P>
<P>As the time of this trial drew near, the distress and agitation of Adeline in∣creased. Though justice demanded the life of the murderer, and though the tenderness and pity which the idea of her father called forth urged her to avenge his death, she could not, without horror, consider herself as the instrument of dispensing that justice which would deprive a fellow-being of existence; and there were times when she wished the secret of her birth had never been revealed. If this sensibility was, in her peculiar
<PB N="314" REF="313"/>
circumstances, a weakness, it was at least an amiable one, and as such deserves to be re∣verenced.</P>
<P>The accounts she received from Vaceau of the health of M. La Luc did not contri∣bute to tranquillize her mind. The symptoms described by Clara seemed to say that he was in the last stage of a consumption, and the grief of Theodore and herself on this occasion was expres∣sed in her letters with the lively eloquence so natural to her. Adeline loved and re∣vered La Luc for his own worth, and for the parental tenderness he had shewed her, but he was still dearer to her as the father of Theodore, and her concern for his declining state was not inferior to that of his children. It was increased by the reflection that she had probably been the means of shortening his life, for she too well knew that the distress occasioned him by the situation in which it had been her misfortune to involve Theodore, had shat∣tered his frame to its present infirmity. The same cause also with-held him from seeking in the climate of Montpellier the relief he had formerly been taught to expect there. When she looked round on the condition of her friends, her heart was almost over∣whelmed with the prospect; it seemed as if she was destined to involve all those most dear to her in calamity. With respect to La Motte, whatever were his vices, and
<PB N="315" REF="314"/>
whatever the designs in which he had for∣merly engaged against her, she forgot them all in the service he had finally rendered her, and considered it to be as much her duty, as she felt it to be her inclination, to intercede in his behalf. This, however, in her present situation, she could not do with any hope of success; but if the suit, upon which depended the establishment of her rank, her fortune, and consequently her influence, should be decided in her favour, she determined to throw herself at the king's feet, and, when she pleaded the cause of Theodore, ask the life of La Motte.</P>
<P>A few days preceding that of the trial Adeline was informed a stranger desired to speak with her, and on going to the room where he was, she found M. Verneuil. Her countenance expressed both surprize and satisfaction at this unexpected meeting, and she inquired, though with little expec∣tation of an affirmative, if he had heard of M. La Luc. <Q REND="inline">"I have seen him,"</Q> said M. Verneuil; <Q REND="inline">"I am just come from Vaceau. But I am sorry I cannot give you a better account of his health. He is greatly altered since I saw him before."</Q></P>
<P>Adeline could scarcely refrain from tears at the recollection these words revived of the calamities which had occasioned this la∣mented change. M. Verneuil delivered her a packet from Clara; as he presented it he said, <Q REND="inline">"Beside this introduction to your no∣tice, I have a claim of a different kind, which I am proud to assert, and which
<PB N="316" REF="315"/>
which will perhaps justify the permission I ask of speaking upon your affairs."—</Q>Adeline bowed, and M. Verneuil, with a countenance expressive of the most ten∣der solicitude, added that he had heard of the late proceeding of the parliament of Paris, and of the discoveries that so intimately concerned her. <Q REND="inline">"I know not,"</Q> continued he, <Q REND="inline">"whether I ought to congratulate or condole with you on this trying occasion. That I sincerely sympathize in all that concerns you I hope you will believe, and I cannot deny my∣self the pleasure of telling you that I am related, though distantly, to the late Marchioness, your mother, for that she <HI>was your mother</HI> I cannot doubt."</Q></P>
<P>Adeline rose hastily and advanced towards M. Verneuil; surprize and satisfaction re∣animated her features. <Q REND="inline">"Do I indeed see a relation?"</Q> said she in a sweet and tremulous voice, <Q REND="inline">"and one whom I can welcome as a friend?"</Q> Tears trembled in her eyes; and she received M. Verneuil's embrace in silence. It was some time before her emo∣tion would permit her to speak.</P>
<P>To Adeline, who from her earliest infan∣cy had been abandoned to strangers, a for∣lorn and helpless orphan; who had never till lately known a relation, and who then found one in the person of an inveterate ene∣my, to her this discovery was as delightful as unexpected. B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t after struggling for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
emotions that <PB N="317" REF="316"/>
pressed upon her heart, she begged M. Ver∣neuil permission to withdraw till she could recover composure. He would have taken leave, but she entreated him not to go.</P>
<P>The interest which M. Verneuil took in the concerns of La Luc, which was strength∣ened by his increasing regard for Clara, had drawn him to Vaceau, where he was in∣formed of the family and peculiar circum∣stances of Adeline. On receiving this in∣telligence he immediately set out for Paris to offer his protection and assistance to his newly-discovered relation, and to aid, if possible, the cause of Theodore.</P>
<P>Adeline in a short time returned, and could then bear to converse on the subject of her family. M. Verneuil offered her his support and assistance, if they should be found necessary. <Q REND="inline">"But I trust,"</Q> added he, <Q REND="inline">"to the justness of your cause, and hope it will not require any adventitious aid. To those who remember the late Marchioness, your features bring sufficient evidence of your birth. As a proof that my judgment in this instance is not biassed by prejudice, the resemblance struck me when I was in Savoy, though I knew the Marchioness only by her portrait; and I believe I mentioned to M. La Luc that you often reminded me of a deceased relation. You may form some judgment of this yourself,"</Q> added M. Verneuil, taking a miniature from
<PB N="318" REF="317"/>
his pocket. <Q REND="inline">"This was your amiable mo∣ther."</Q></P>
<P>Adeline's countenance changed; she re∣ceived the picture eagerly, gazed on it for a long time in silence, and her eyes filled with tears. It was not the resemblance she studied, but the countenance—the mild and beautiful countenance of her parent, whose blue eyes, full of tender sweetness, seemed bent upon her's; while a soft smile played on her lips; Adeline pressed the picture to her's, and again gazed in silent reverie. At length, with a deep sigh, she said, <Q REND="inline">"This surely <HI>was</HI> my mother. Had she <HI>but</HI> lived, O my poor father! you had been spared."</Q> This reflection quite overcame her, and she burst into tears. M. Verneuil did not interrupt her grief, but took her hand and sat by her without speak∣ing till she became more composed. Again kissing the picture, she held it out to him with a hesitating look. <Q REND="inline">"No,"</Q> said he, <Q REND="inline">"it is already with its true owner."</Q> She thank∣ed him with a smile of ineffable sweetness, and after some conversation on the subject of the approaching trial, on which occasion she requested M. Verneuil would support her by his presence, he withdrew, having begged leave to repeat his visit on the following day.</P>
<P>Adeline now opened her packet, and saw once more the well-known characters of
<PB N="319" REF="318"/>
Theodore; for a moment she felt as if in his presence, and the conscious blush overspread her cheek; with a trembling hand she broke the seal, and read the tenderest assurances and solicitudes of his love; she often paused that she might prolong the sweet emotions which these assurances awakened, but while tears of tenderness stood trembling on her eyelids, the bitter recollection of his situati∣on would return, and they fell in anguish on her bosom.</P>
<P>He congratulated her, and with peculiar delicacy, on the prospects of life which were opening to her; said every thing that might tend to animate and support her, but avoided dwelling on his own circumstances, except by expressing his sense of the zeal and kind∣ness of his commanding officer, and adding, that he did not despair of finally obtaining a pardon.</P>
<P>This hope, though but faintly expressed, and written evidently for the purpose of con∣soling Adeline, did not entirely fail of the desired effect. She yielded to its enchanting influence, and forgot for a while the many subjects of care and anxiety which surround∣ed her. Theodore said little of his father's health; what he did say was by no means so discouraging as the accounts of Clara, who, less anxious to conceal a truth that must give pain to Adeline, expressed, with∣out
<PB N="320" REF="319"/>
reserve, all her apprehension and con∣cern.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE day of the trial so anxiously awaited, and on which the fate of so many persons depended, at length arrived. Adeline, ac∣companied by M. Verneuil and Madame la Motte, appeared as the prosecutor of the Marquis de Montalt; and d'Aunoy, du Bosse, Louis de la Motte, and several other persons, as witness in her cause. The judges were some of the most distinguished in France; and the advocates on both sides men of eminent abilities. On a trial of such im∣portance the court, as may be imagined, was crowded with persons of distinction, and the spectacle it presented was strikingly so∣lemn, yet magnificent.</P>
<P>When she appeared before the tribunal, Adeline's emotion surpassed all the arts of disguise, but adding to the natural dignity of her air an expression of soft timidity, and to her downcast eyes a sweet confusion, it rendered her an object still more interesting; and she attracted the universal pity and ad∣miration
<PB N="321" REF="320"/>
of the assembly. When she ven∣tured to raise her eyes, she perceived that the Marquis was not yet in the court, and while she awaited his appearance in tremb∣ling expectation, a confused murmuring rose in a distant part of the hall. Her spirits now almost forsook her; the certainty of seeing immediately, and consciously, the murderer of her father, chilled her with horror, and she was with difficulty preserved from fainting. A low sound now ran through the court, and an air of confusion appeared, which was soon communicated to the tribunal itself. Several of the members arose, some left the hall, the whole place exhibited a scene of disorder, and a report at length reached Ade∣line that the Marquis de Montalt was dying. A considerable time elapsed in uncertainty; but the confusion continued; the Marquis did not appear; and at Adeline's request M. Verneuil went in quest of more positive in∣formation.</P>
<P>He followed a crowd which was hurrying towards the Chatelet, and with some diffi∣culty gained admittance into the prison; but the porter at the gate, whom he had bribed for a passport, could give him no certain information on the subject of his enquiry, and not being at liberty to quit his post, fur∣nished M. Verneuil with only a vague di∣rection to the Marquis's apartment. The courts were silent and deserted, but as he
<PB N="322" REF="321"/>
advanced a distant hum of voices led him on, still perceiving several persons running to∣wards a staircase which appeared beyond the archway of a long passage, he followed thi∣ther, and learned that the Marquis was cer∣tainly dying. The staircase was filled with people; he endeavoured to press through the crowd, and after much struggle and dif∣ficulty he reached the door of an anti-room which communicated with the apartment where the Marquis lay, and whence several persons now issued. Here he learned that the object of his enquiry was already dead. M. Verneuil, however, pressed through the anti-room to the chamber where lay the Marquis on a bed surrounded by officers of the law, and two notaries, who appeared to have been taking down depositions. His countenance was suffused with a black, and deadly hue, and impressed with the horrors of death; M. Verneuil turned away, shock∣ed by the spectacle, and on enquiry heard that the Marquis had died by poison.</P>
<P>It appeared that convinced he had nothing to hope from his trial, he had taken this me∣thod of avoiding an ignominious death. In the last hours of life, while tortured with the remembrance of his crime, he resolv∣ed to make all the atonement that remained for him, and having swallowed the potion, he immediately sent for a confessor to take a full confession of his guilt, and two nota∣ries,
<PB N="323" REF="322"/>
and thus established Adeline beyond dispute in the rights of her birth; and al∣so bequeathed her a considerable legacy.</P>
<P>In consequence of these depositions she was soon after formally acknowledged as the daughter and heiress of Henry Marquis de Montalt, and the rich estates of her father were restored to her. She immediately threw herself at the feet of the king in be∣half of Theodore and of La Motte. The character of the former, the cause in which he had risked his life, and the occasion of the late Marquis's enmity towards him, were circumstances so notorious, and so forcible, that it is more than probable the monarch would have granted his pardon to a pleader less irresistible than was Adeline de Mon∣talt. Theodore La Luc not only received an ample pardon, but in consideration of his gallant conduct towards Adeline, he was soon after raised to a post of considerable rank in the army.</P>
<P>For La Motte, who had been condemned for the robbery on full evidence, and who had been also charged with the crime which had formerly compelled him to quit Paris, a pardon could not be obtained; but at the earnest supplication of Adeline, and in con∣sideration of the service he had finally ren∣dered her, his sentence was softened from death to banishment. This indulgence, however, would have availed him little, had
<PB N="324" REF="323"/>
not the noble generosity of Adeline silenced other prosecutions that were preparing a∣gainst him, and bestowed on him a sum more than sufficient to support his family in a foreign country. This kindness operated so powerfully upon his heart, which had been betrayed through weakness rather than natural depravity, and awakened so keen a a remorse for the injuries he had once me∣ditated against a benefactress so noble, that his former habits became odious to him, and his character gradually recovered the hue which it would probably always have worn had he never been exposed to the tempting dissipations of Paris.</P>
<P>The passion which Louis had so long own∣ed for Adeline was raised almost to adoration by her late conduct; but he now relinquish∣ed even the saint hope which he had hitherto almost unconsciously cherished, and, since the life which was granted to Theodore rendered this sacrifice necessary, he could not repine. He resolved, how∣ever, to seek in absence the tranquility he had lost, and to place his future happiness on that of two persons so deservedly dear to him.</P>
<P>On the eve of his departure La Motte and his family took a very affecting leave of Ade∣line; he left Paris for England, where it was his design to settle; and Louis, who was eager to fly from her enchantments, set out on the same day for his regiment.</P>
<P><PB N="325" REF="324"/>
Adeline remained some time at Paris to settle her affairs, where she was introduced by M. V— to the few and distant re∣lations that remained of her family. Among these were the Count and Countess D—, and the Mon. Amand, who had so much engaged her pity and esteem at Nice. The lady, whose death he lamented, was of the family of de Montalt; and the resemblance which he had traced between her features and those of Adeline, her cousin, was some∣thing more than the effect of fancy. The death of his elder brother had abruptly re∣called him from Italy; but Adeline had the satisfaction to observe, that the heavy melancholy which formerly oppressed him, had yielded to a sort of placid resignation, and that his countenance was often enliven∣ed by a transient gleam of cheerfulness.</P>
<P>The Count and Countess D—, who were much interested by her goodness and beauty, invited her to make their hotel her residence while she remained at Paris.</P>
<P>Her first care was to have the remains of her parent removed from the Abbey of St. Clair, and deposited in the vault of his an∣cestors. D'Aunoy was tried, condemned, and hanged, for the murder. At the place of execution he had described the spot where the remains of the Marquis were concealed, which was in the stone-room already men∣tioned, belonging to the Abbey. M. V— accompanied the officers appointed for the search, and attended the ashes of the Mar∣quis to St. Maur, an estate in one of the northern provinces. There they were depo∣sited with the solemn funeral pomp becoming his rank. Adeline attended as chief mourn∣er;
<PB N="326" REF="325"/>
and this last duty paid to the memory of her parent, she became more tranquil and resigned. The MS. that recorded his suf∣ferings had been found at the Abbey, and delivered to her by M. V—, and she preserved it with the pious enthusiasm so sacred a relique deserved.</P>
<P>On her return to Paris, Theodore La Luc, who was come from Montpelier, awaited her arrival. The happiness of this meeting was clouded by the account he brought of his father, whose extreme dan∣ger had alone withheld him from hastening, the moment he obtained his liberty, to thank Adeline for the life she had preserved. She now received him as the friend to whom she was indebted for her preservation, and as the lover who deserved, and possessed, her tenderest affection The remembrance of the circumstances under which they had last met, and of their mutual anguish, render∣ed more exquisite the happiness of the pre∣sent moments, when no longer oppressed by the horrid prospect of ignominious death and final separation, they looked forward only to the smiling days that awaited them when hand in hand they should tread the flowery scenes of life. The contrast which memo∣ry drew of the past with the present, fre∣quently drew tears of tenderness and grati∣tude to their eyes, and the sweet smile which seemed struggling to dispel from the coun∣tenance of Adeline those gems of sorrow, penetrated the heart of Theodore, and brought to his recollection a little song which in other circumstances he had formerly sung to her. He took up a lute that lay on the table, and touching the dulcet chords, ac∣companied it with the following words:
<Q><PB N="327" REF="326"/>
<LG TYPE="song">
<HEAD>SONG.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>The rose that weeps with morning dew,</L>
<L>And glitters in the sunny ray,</L>
<L>In tears and smiles resembles you,</L>
<L>When Love breaks Sorrow's cloud away.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The dews that bend the blushing flow'r,</L>
<L>Enrich the scent—renew the glow;</L>
<L>So Love's sweet tears exalt his pow'r,</L>
<L>So bliss more brightly shines by woe!</L>
</LG>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>Her affection for Theodore had induced Adeline to reject several suitors which her goodness, beauty, and wealth, had already attracted, and whom, though infinitely his superiors in point of fortune, were many of them inferior to him in family, and all of them in merit.</P>
<P>The various and tumultuous emotions which the late events had called forth in the bosom of Adeline were now sub∣sided; but the memory of her father still tinctured her mind with a melan∣choly that time only could subdue; and she refused to listen to the supplications of Theodore till the period she had pre∣scribed for her mourning should be ex∣pired. The necessity of re-joining his regiment obliged him to leave Paris within the fortnight after his arrival; but he carried with him assurance of receiv∣ing her hand soon after she should lay aside her sable habit, and departed therefore with tolerable composure.</P>
<P>M. La Luc's very precarious state was a source of incessant disquietude to Ade∣line, and she determined to accompany M. V—, who was now the declared lover of Clara, to Montpelier, whither La Luc had immediately gone on the liberation of his son. For this journey
<PB N="328" REF="327"/>
she was preparing when she received from her friend a flattering account of his amendment; and as some farther set∣tlement of her affairs required her pre∣sence at Paris, she deferred her design, and M. V— departed alone.</P>
<P>When Theodore's affairs assumed a more favourable aspect, M. Verneuil had written to La Luc, and communicated to him the secret of his heart respect∣ing Clara. La Luc, who admired and esteemed M. V—, and who was not ignorant of his family connections, was pleased with the proposed alliance; Clara thought she had never seen any person whom she was so much inclined to love; and M. V— received an an∣swer favourable to his wishes, and which encouraged him to undertake the present journey to Montpelier.</P>
<P>The restoration of his happiness and the climate of Montpelier did all for the health of La Luc that his most anxious friends could wish, and he was at length so far recovered as to visit Adeline at her estate of St. Maur. Clara and M. V— accompanied him, and a cessation of hos∣tilities between France and Spain soon after permitted Theodore to join this happy party. When La Luc, thus restored to those most dear to him, looked back on the miseries he had escaped, and forward to the blessings that awaited him, his heart dilated with emotions of exquisite joy and gratitude; and his venerable countenance, softened by an expression of complacent delight, exhibited a perfect picture of happy age.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>ADELINE, in the society of friends so beloved, lost the impression of that melan∣choly which the fate of her parent had occasioned; she recovered all her natural vi∣vacity; and when she threw off the mourning habit which filial piety had required her to assume, she gave her hand to Theodore. The nuptials, which were celebrated at St. Maur, were graced by the presence of the Count and Countess D—, and La Luc had the supreme felicity of confirming on the same day the flattering destinies of both his children. When the ceremony was over he blessed and embraced them all with tears of fatherly affection. <Q REND="inline">"I thank thee O God! that I have been permitted to see this hour;"</Q> said he, <Q REND="inline">"whenever it shall please thee to call me hence, I shall depart in peace."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Long, very long, may you be spared to bless your children,"</Q> replied Adeline. Cla∣ra kissed her father's hand and wept: <Q REND="inline">"Long, very long,"</Q> she repeated in a voice scarce∣ly audible. La Luc smiled cheerfully, and turned the conversation to a subject less affect∣ing.</P>
<P>But the time now drew nigh when La Luc thought it necessary to return to the du∣ties of his parish, from which he had so long
<PB N="330" REF="329"/>
been absent. Madame La Luc too, who had attended him during the period of his danger at Montpelier, and hence returned to Savoy, complained much of the solitude of her life; and this was with her brother an additional motive for his speedy departure. Theodore and Adeline, who could not support the thought of a separation, endeavoured to persuade him to give up his chateau, and to reside with them in France; but he was held by many ties to Leloncourt. For many years he had constituted the comfort and hap∣piness of his parishioners; they revered and loved him as a father—he regarded them with an affection little short of parental. The attachment they discovered towards him on his departure was not forgotten either; it had made a deep impression on his mind, and he could not bear the thought of forsak∣ing them now that Heaven had showered on him its abundance. <Q REND="inline">"It is sweet to live for them,"</Q> said he, <Q REND="inline">"and I will also die amongst them."</Q> A sentiment also of a more tender nature,—(and let not the sto∣ic prophane it with the name of weakness, or the man of the world scorn it as unnatu∣ral)—a sentiment still more tender attracted him to Leloncourt,—the remains of his wife reposed there.</P>
<P>Since La Luc would not reside in France, Theodore and Adeline, to whom the splen∣did gaieties that courted them at Paris were very inferior temptations to the sweet do∣mestic pleasures and refined society which Leloncourt would afford, determined to accompany La Luc and Mon. and Madame Verneuil abroad. Adeline arranged her af∣fairs so as to render her residence in France
<PB N="331" REF="330"/>
unnecessary; and having bade an affection∣ate adieu to the Count and Countess D—, and to M. Amand, who had recovered a tole∣rable degree of cheerfulness, she departed with her friends for Savoy.</P>
<P>They travelled leisurely, and frequently turned out of their way to view whatever was worthy of observation. After a long and pleasant journey they came once more within view of the Swiss mountains, the sight of which revived a thousand interesting re∣collections in the mind of Adeline. She re∣membred the circumstances and the sensati∣ons under which she had first seen them—when an orphan, flying from persecution to seek shelter among strangers, and lost to the only person on earth whom she loved—she remembered this, and the contrast of the present moment struck with all its force upon her heart.</P>
<P>The countenance of Clara brightened into smiles of the most animated delight as she drew near the beloved scenes of her infant pleasures; and Theodore, often looking from the windows, caught with patriotic en∣thusiasm the magnificent and changing scene∣ry which the receding mountains successive∣ly disclosed.</P>
<P>It was evening when they approached with∣in a few miles of Leloncourt, and the road wind∣ing round the foot of a stupendous cragg, presented them a full view of the lake, and of the peaceful dwelling of La Luc. An ex∣clamation of joy from the whole party an∣nounced the discovery, and the glance of pleasure was reflected from every eye. The sun's last light gleamed upon the waters that reposed in <Q REND="inline">"chrystal purity"</Q> below, mel∣lowed
<PB N="332" REF="331"/>
every feature of the landscape, and touched with purple splendour the clouds that rolled along the mountain tops.</P>
<P>La Luc welcomed his family to his happy home, and sent up a silent thanksgiving that he was permitted thus to return to it. Ade∣line continued to gaze upon each well-known object, and again reflecting on the vicissitudes of grief and joy, and the surprising change of fortune which she had experienced since last she saw them, her heart dilated with gra∣titude and complacent delight. She looked at Theodore, whom in these very scenes she had lamented as lost to her for ever; who when found again, was about to be torn from her by an ignominious death, but who now sat by her side her secure and happy hus∣band, the pride of his family and herself; and while the sensibility of her heart flowed in tears from her eyes, a smile of ineffable tenderness told him all she felt. He gently pressed her hand, and answered her with a look of love.</P>
<P>Peter, who now rode up to the carriage with a face full of joy and of importance, interrupted a course of sentiment which was become almost too interesting. <Q REND="inline">"Ah! my dear master!"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline">"welcome home again. Here is the village, God bless it! It is worth a million such places as Paris. Thank St. Jacques, we are all come safe back again!"</Q></P>
<P>This effusion of honest Peter's joy was received and answered with the kindness it deserved. As they drew near the lake music sounded over the water, and they presently saw a large party of the villagers assembled on a green spot that sloped to the very margin of the waves, and dancing in

all their holiday finery. It was the evening of a festival. The elder peasants sat under the shade of the trees that crowned this little eminence, eating milk and fruits, and watching their sons and daughters frisk it away to the sprightly notes of the tabor and pipe, which was joined by the softer tones of a mandolin.</P>
<P>The scene was highly interesting, and what added to its picturesque beauty was a groupe of cattle that stood, some on the brink, some half in the water, and others reposing on the green bank, while several peasant girls, dressed in the neat simplicity of their country, were dispensing the milky feast. Peter now rode on first, and a crowd soon collected round him, who learning that their beloved master was at hand, went forth to meet and welcome him Their warm and honest expressions of joy diffused an exquisite satisfaction over the heart of the good La Luc, who met them with the kindness of a father, and who could scarcely forbear shed∣ding tears to this testimony of their attach∣ment When the younger part of the pea∣sants heard the news of his arrival, the ge∣neral joy was such, that, led by the tabor and pipe, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y danced before his carriage to the chateau, where they again welcomed him and his family with the enlivening strains of music. At the gate of the chate<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u they were receiv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d by Madame La Luc, and a happier party never met.</P>
<P>As the evening was uncommonly mild and beautiful, supper was spread in the gar∣den. When the repast was over, Clara, whose heart was all glee, proposed a dance by moonlight <Q REND="inline">"It will be delicious,"</Q> said she; <Q REND="inline">"the moon-beams are already dancing on the waters. See what a stream

of radiance they throw across the lake, and, how they sparkle round that little promontory on the left. The freshness of the hour too invites to dancing."</Q></P>
<P>They all agreed to the proposal.—<Q REND="inline">"And let the good people who have so heartily welcomed us home be called in too,"</Q> said La Luc: <Q REND="inline">"they shall <HI>all</HI> par∣take our happiness. There is devotion in making others happy, and gratitude ought to make us devout. Peter, bring more wine, and set some tables under the trees."</Q> Peter flew, and, while chairs and tables were placing, Clara ran for her favourite lute, the lute which had formerly afforded her such delight, and which Adeline had often touched with a melancholy expression. Clara's light hand now ran over the chorus, and drew forth tones of tender sweetness, her voice accom∣panying the following

<L>Now at Moonlight's fairy hour,</L>
<L>When faintly gleams each dewy steep,</L>
<L>And vale and mountain, lake and bow'r,</L>
<L>In solitary grandeur sleep;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When slowly sinks the evening breeze,</L>
<L>That lulls the mind in pensive care,</L>

<LG>
<L>Bid the merry, merry tabor sound,</L>
<L>And with the Fays of lawn or glade,</L>

<L>"Now at Moonlight's fairy hour"</L>

<P>Peter, who could not move in a sober step, had already spread refreshments under the trees, and in a short time the lawn was encircled with peasantry. The rural pipe and tabor were placed, at Clara's request, under the shade of her beloved acacias on the
<PB N="335" REF="334"/>
he margin of the lake; the merry notes of music sounded, Adeline led off the dance, and the mountains answered only to the strains of mirth and melody.</P>
<P>The venerable La Luc, as he sat among the elder peasants, surveyed the scene—his children and people thus assembled round him in one grand compact of harmony and joy—the frequent tear bedewed his cheek, and he seemed to taste the fullness of an ex∣alted delight.</P>
<P>So much was every heart roused to glad∣ness, that the morning dawn began to peep upon the scene of their festivity, when every cottager returned to his home blessing the benevolence of La Luc.</P>
<P>After passing some weeks with La Luc, M. Verneuil bought a chateau in the vil∣lage of Leloncourt, and as it was the only one not already occupied, Theodore look∣ed out for a residence in the neighbourhood. At the distance of a few leagues, on the beautiful banks of the lake of Geneva, where the waters retire into a small bay, he pur∣chased a villa. The Chateau was charac∣terized by an air of simplicity and taste, ra∣ther than of magnificence, which however was the chief treat in the surrounding scene. The chateau was almost encircled with woods, which forming a grand amphitheatre swept, down to the water's edge, and abounded with wild and romantic walks. Here nature was suffered to sport in all her beautiful luxu∣riance, except where here, and there, the hand of art formed the foliage to admit a view of the blue waters of the lake, with the white sail that glided by, or of the distant moun∣tains. In front of the chateau the woods opened to a lawn, and the eye was suffered
<PB N="336" REF="335"/>
to wander over the lake, whose bosom pre∣sented an ever-moving picture, while its va∣ried margin sprinkled with villas, woods, and towns, and crowned beyond with the snowy and sublime alps, rising point behind point in awful confusion, exhibited a scene∣ry of almost unequalled magnificence.</P>
<P>Here contemning the splendour of false happiness, and possessing the pure and rati∣onal delights of a love refined into the most tender friendship, surrounded by the friends so dear to them, and visited by a select and enlightened society—here, in the very bo∣som of felicity, lived Theodore and Adeline La Luc.</P>
<P>The passion of Louis De la Motte yielded at length to the powers of absence and neces∣sity. He still loved Adeline, but it was with the placid tenderness of friendship, and when at the earnest invitation of Theodore, he visi∣ted the villa, he beheld their happiness with a satisfaction unalloyed by any emotions of envy. He afterwards married a lady of some fortune at Geneva, and resigning his com∣mission in the French service, settled on the borders of the lake, and increased the soci∣al delights of Theodore and Adeline.</P>
<P>Their formal lives afforded an example of trials well endured—and their present, of virtues greatly rewarded; and this reward they continued to deserve—for not to them∣selves was their happiness contracted, but diffused to all who came within the sphere of their influence. The indigent and unhappy rejoiced in their benevolence, the virtuous and enlightened in their friendship, and their children in parents whose example im∣pressed upon their hearts the precepts offered to their understandings.</P>
