<P>THE spectator and reader of the follow∣ing performance, will find the manners and customs of <HI>Mexico</HI> and <HI>Peru</HI> introduced, as appertaining to the <HI>first discovered natives</HI> of the western world.—This deviation afforded the author an opportunity of introducing manners and customs, more congenial to dramatic use, and more particularly of pre∣senting from MARMONTEL'S INCAS, the pa∣thetic tale of <HI>Cora</HI> and <HI>Alonzo.</HI></P>
<P>To MR. HARRIS, the author offers his acknowledgments for the extreme attention he has paid to this performance, and the magnificent decorations he has bestowed on it.</P>

<BYLINE>WRITTEN BY W. T. FITZGERALD, ESQ. SPOKEN BY MR. HOLMAN.</BYLINE>
<SP>
<LG>
<L>WHEN famed Columbus nobly dared to brave,</L>
<L>The untry'd perils of the Western wave;</L>
<L>Ten thousand dangers in his passage lay,</L>
<L>Dark was his night, and dreary was his day!</L>
<L>The rude companions of his bold design,</L>
<L>Fatigued with toil, against their chief combine:</L>
<L>When sudden—bursting on th' astonish'd view!</L>
<L>A world discovered, proved his judgment true.—</L>
<L>"Yet black ingratitude, the Great Man's fate!</L>
<L>"Pursued Columbus with envenomed hate;</L>
<L>"But minds like his a base degenerate race,</L>
<L>"Might meanly persecute—but not disgrace:</L>
<L>"The noble soul its energy maintains,</L>
<L>"In spite of dungeons, tyranny, and chains."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The sons of Europe found a guileless race,</L>
<L>No fraud was veiled beneath the smiling face;</L>
<L>Their manners, mild, benevolent, and kind,</L>
<L>Pourtrayed the cloudless sunshine of the mind:</L>
<L>Bless'd in their Prince's patriarchal reign,</L>
<L>Whose power relieved, but ne'er inflicted pain,</L>
<L>Their placid lives no fancy'd evils knew;</L>
<L>Their joys were many, and their wants were few.</L>
<L>One custom with their virtues ill agreed,</L>
<L>Which made Humanity with anguish bleed;</L>
<L>Compelled at Superstition's shrine to bow,</L>
<L>The hapless victims of a cruel vow!</L>
<L><PB REF="5"/>Their sweetest maids were often doomed to prove,</L>
<L>No joy in friendship, nor no bliss in love!</L>
<L>Yet love and nature cannot be supprest,</L>
<L>The sigh will heave, and palpitate the breast;</L>
<L>For spite of vows, which Heaven's wise laws disown,</L>
<L>Love sits triumphant on the heart—his throne!</L>
<L>And breaks those fetters bigots would impose,</L>
<L>To aggravate the sense of human woes!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The rigid laws of time, and place, our bard,</L>
<L>In this night's drama, ventures to discard:</L>
<L>If here he errs—he errs with <HI>him</HI> whose name,</L>
<L>Stands without rival on the rolls of Fame;</L>
<L><HI>Him</HI> whom the passions own with one accord,</L>
<L>Their Great Dictator, and despotic Lord!</L>
<L>Who placed aloft on Inspiration's throne,</L>
<L>Made Fancy's magic kingdom all his own,</L>
<L>Burst from the trammels which his muse confined,</L>
<L>And poured the wealth of his exhaustless mind!</L>
<L>Though SHAKSPEARE'S flight no mortal shall pursue—</L>
<L>COLUMBUS' story patronized by you,</L>
<L>Will yield an off'ring, grateful to his dust—</L>
<L>A British laurel on a hero's bust!</L>

<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="scene">
<HEAD>SCENE I.—<HI>On one side of the stage a flight of steps, with a Portico leading to the Temple of the Sun.—In the back∣ground the sea. Time, sun-rise.</HI></HEAD>
<STAGE>Catalpo <HI>and Priests from the Temple, who range themselves—then enter</HI> Orozimbo—<HI>they bow to him as he passes.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>OROZIMBO, <HI>prostrating himself to the sun.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>SOUL of the universe, who from they glittering throne beamest immortal splendour, as thou hast permitted the stars for their appointed hour to bespangle the veil of night, now o'erwhelm all manner of glories in the greatness of thy efful∣gence, and be once more welcom'd by thy de∣voted servants to delight and bless the world!—Catalpo, conduct hither the virgin destined to re∣ceive a priestess' sacred office.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><PB N="2" REF="8"/>CATALPO <HI>exit, and re-enters with</HI> SOLASCO, <HI>lead∣ing in</HI> CORA.</STAGE>

<SPEAKER>Solasco </SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(kneels.)</STAGE>
<P>Mighty chief!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Orozimba.</SPEAKER>
<P>Rise, good Solasco.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Solasco.</SPEAKER>
<P>I here present the darling of my age to be devoted to the service of our god. It will be worse than parting with my life to lose the com∣forts of her dear society—but the bright sun, our glorious deity, demands such excellence to be consigned alone to do <HI>him</HI> honour.—Pardon, my king, an old man's tears; but nature will not al∣ways, without a struggle, yield to duty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Orozimbo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thou hast, indeed, devoted to thy god a precious treasure; but tell me, Cora, can thy youthful mind freely resign the livelier joys of social life, and rest contented in seclusion and tranquillity?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cora.</SPEAKER>
<P>My father's will has ever sway'd my thoughts, from the first hour that infant sense cou'd learn obedience:—Should he doom my death, his mandate would be met with equal re∣signation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Orozimbo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thy pious mind, which knows to yield such duty to a father, will well befit the ser∣vice of thy god.—But hear the sacred tenour of the law which binds a priestess to her duty.— Should the heart, to heaven devoted, become the prey of sacrilegious love, our law consigns its priestess, and the accomplice of her guilt, to in∣stant death. Her parents and their offspring are pledges for her faith, and should her flight elude offended justice, their forfeit lives must expiate her crime. <STAGE>[Cora <HI>bows to the sun.</HI>]</STAGE> Now to the altar, and record your vows; then, as our custom is, come forth to shine Queen of this festive day,
<PB N="3" REF="9"/>the last you are to know exempt from sacred duty.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Exeunt</HI> Cora, Solasco, <HI>and</HI> Priests, <HI>to the Temple.</HI></STAGE>
<STAGE>During the latter part of this scene the sun becomes obscured by clouds, and thunder and lightning issue from them—the sea much agitated.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Catalpho.</SPEAKER>
<P>Great chief, behold what envious clouds obscure the glories of our god.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Orozimbo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Say, Catalpo, what mean these bo∣dings! <STAGE>A ship appears from behind a projecting rock.</STAGE> And lo!—What monster's that, whose wings bear it buoyant on the angry main?</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>A cannon is discharged from the ship.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Catalpo.</SPEAKER>
<P>See!—From its throat thunder and fire burst forth, seeming to brave high heaven.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Orozimbo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Be not dismay'd—summon our war∣riors. <STAGE>[<HI>to</HI> Cuto.]</STAGE> Catalpo, let the priests attend.</P>

<P>My people, we'll to the shore— Should they prove mortal foes, we'll meet their thunders, or if the engines of infernal power, what can virtue fear?—Trust me, the Deity we serve, will re-assume his splendour, and protect his chosen people.</P>

<STAGE><HI>Enter from the Boat,</HI> Columbus, Alonzo, Roldan, Valverdo, Harry Herbert, <HI>and the rest of the Spanish Adventurers.</HI>—Columbus <HI>lands first, with his Sword drawn—he falls and embraces the Earth, during which Time there are three Cheers, and a discharge of Artillery; then the rest follow and come forward.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Columbus.</SPEAKER>
<P>First, to high Heaven, who thus, with never-fading honour, hath crown'd its poorest servant, let me pour forth a heart o'erwhelm'd with gratitude. And now begin the important work which heaven has delegated to us—Erect the sacred banner of our faith.</P>
<STAGE>The Cross is erected on one side of the stage.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alonzo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Brave associates! join with me in praise of him, who hath atchiev'd what ignorance, with sapient shrug, and satisfied, benumbing prudence derided as the chimera of a madman's fancy: falling at his feet, let us be proud in being first to pay due homage to such surpassing excellence.</P>
<STAGE>They all kneel.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Columbus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Rise, rise;—rather, my Alonzo, in these arms receive my thanks, thou, next to heaven, my firmest friend. Ye men of Spain, let what has passed admonish you in what may be to come—keep in your minds the time when we had gained the course which shut out the eastern world; how you beat your breasts, op∣pressed
<PB N="5" REF="11"/>with fear and superstition—How, with womanish tears, you bade adieu to life, and blub∣bered out a requiem for your souls; then em∣bracing desperation instead of fortitude, I was to be your sacrifice; and this body, which has been your conduct to wealth and honour, you would have given to the sea, and ignorance and cow∣ardice would have triumphed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Valverdo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mighty Sir, forgive us!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Columbus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Freely, good Valverdo—Let the man stand forth, who, at a time so fraught with peril, first discovered land.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Herbert. </SPEAKER>
<STAGE>[Coming forward.]</STAGE>
<P>It was my good fortune.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Columbus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thou art not a Spaniard.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Herbert.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, your Excellency, I am an Eng∣lishman; and tho' we Englishmen are an odd, whimsical set of fellows, yet we generally con∣trive (and I trust ever shall) to keep a good look out a-head when our superior is in danger.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Columbus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tell me your fortunes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Herbert.</SPEAKER>
<P>My name is Harry Herbert; I am de∣scended from as respectable and independent an ancestor as the world can boast, — an English yeo∣man; but the civil wars leaving my family little, which my imprudence soon made less, I thought that, altho' King Henry was deprived of the honour of this enterprize, that did not preclude his subjects; so I shipped myself off for Castille, where I had just time and cash enough to fall a dozen times in love, and into other serapes, be∣fore I had the honour of embarking on board your Excellency's squadron.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Columbus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Herbert, thou dost honour to thy country.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Herbert.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then, Sir, I am glad, that for once I
<PB N="6" REF="12"/>am even with it; for I am sure my country does honour to me.</P>
<STAGE>Indian music without.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Roldan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Behold a crowd of people, many of whom seem clad in sacred vestments—Their dress and standards bespeak them greatly civilized, and full of wealth.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter in procession Indian Warriors, bearing a Standard of the Sun</HI>—Orozimbo, Cora, &amp;c.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Orozimbo. </SPEAKER>
<STAGE>[Descends from his car.]</STAGE>
<P>Strangers, who seem to be above the race of mortals, instruct us how to honour you—If you be children of the Sun, behold our priests, who with perfumes and libations, will welcome you to his holy temple; or, if human, here are fruits to feed you, dwell∣ings to shelter you, and garments to clothe you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Columbus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Chief, you behold in us the children of mortality; but the power we serve, in his high mercy, has bestowed upon us superior gifts; thus, thro' unknown seas to brave the imperious surge, and to construct engines which can sweep thousands from the earth—But that Deity com∣mands us to proclaim his name with peace—The King, our master, wishes to enrich thee and him∣self —this hardy metal, useful in all the purposes of life, he will exchange for those thy country may produce.</P>
<STAGE>Presents a hatchet.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Orozimbo.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis very strange—Thy King much wrongs himself—all we have to render is our gold, but that we find so yielding, and so useless, it were an injury to offer it—Indulge the curiosity of a stranger.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>[Orozimbo, <HI>with</HI> Columbus, Roldan, Her∣bert, Nelti, Catalpo, <HI>&amp;c. move up the stage.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alonzo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oft has a tender glance escap'd my eye, impell'd by Beauty's power, and from my bosom
<PB N="7" REF="13"/>the soft sigh instinctively has stolen—Many a fair Castilian has enforced this test of admiration, but now my every sense seems drawn by power magnetic to that lovely saint—Permit me, fairest creature, to express my admiration at the charms which now present themselves—tho' all the won∣ders of a new discovered world display their rival novelties, yet, now that I behold its first of won∣ders, all else exacts from me as little notice, as I, I fear, have power or merit to command from you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cora.</SPEAKER>
<P>Strange you wrong yourself, and hold me unskilful to distinguish, when you suppose desert like yours can pass unnoticed—Your praises of the humble Cora, tho' they have caused no vain emotion, yet ever will the mind receive with plea∣sure, praise e'en unmerited, when 'tis bestowed by those who claim our admiration.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alonzo.</SPEAKER>
<P>All that the warmest fancy can depict in the bright colours of ideal excellence, can never reach that exquisite perfection nature ex∣hibits —how must I bless my happy fortune, that bore me to a clime which boasts an or∣nament like thee.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cora. </SPEAKER>
<STAGE>[Aside.]</STAGE>
<P>What new emotion rises in my breast—I fear to ask my heart from whence it springs. Oh, Cora! think of thy sacred duty— think of the vow which pass'd thy lips so lately.— Stranger, tho' sacred hospitality commanded me to pay this courtesy, yet now a higher duty en∣joins me to desist from further converse.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alonzo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let me entreat one instant—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cora.</SPEAKER>
<P>It must not be—my conduct is controlled by rigid laws. Farewell.—Oh Cora, what days of wretchedness art thou doom'd to suffer!</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Aside, as she retires to the priests. Alonzo.</STAGE>
<SP>
<PB N="8" REF="14"/>
<SPEAKER>Alonzo.</SPEAKER>
<P>What cou'd she mean? "Her con∣duct is controlled by rigid laws"—If she be des∣tined to another, my lot is misery.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Orozimbo</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>[with <HI>Columbus,</HI> coming forward.]</STAGE>
<P>In harmony and peace I rule a free and happy people, and I were unworthy of my kingdom, did I not endeavour to the utmost to convert the name of stranger into friend.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>[Exeunt</HI> Orozimbo <HI>and</HI> Columbus, <HI>hand in hand; Priests follow; then</HI> Alonzo, Roldan, Val∣verdo, &amp;c. <HI>and the Spanish and Indian soldiers —One party bow to the cross, the other to the sun.]</HI></STAGE>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Herbert.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so, my pretty Indian, you live very happily.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nelti.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, all the day long.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Herbert.</SPEAKER>
<P>And have you no monks who pray for you, dispute with you, and burn you alive when you don't think as they do?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nelti.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! no.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Herbert.</SPEAKER>
<P>Poor devils, what a way they must be in.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nelti.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't you come from the other world?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Herbert.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, you see something angelic about me, eh!—Yes, my love, I come from a little paradise, call'd England.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nelti.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is England a world?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Herbert.</SPEAKER>
<P>A bit of one; but, little as it is, it somehow contrives to manage all the rest.— Shou'd you like to live in England?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nelti.</SPEAKER>
<P>O yes; I suppose English women, arm'd with spears made of that pretty, hard iron, climb the mountains, and destroy the wild bull.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Herbert.</SPEAKER>
<P>Destroy the wild bull! No, my dear; our English women find prettier amusement in
<PB N="9" REF="15"/>encouraging the breed of horned cattle—the use of the pretty, hard iron is confined to the men, and no great favourite there; for I know many flourishers of spontoons, who have a cursed antipathy to cold iron.—Who is that elegant creature you were conversing with?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nelti.</SPEAKER>
<P>Her name is Cora; she was this day ad∣mitted a priestess of the Sun.—The handsomest virgins are always selected to sustain that sacred office.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Herbert.</SPEAKER>
<P>The handsomest! you were then, on that account, not—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nelti.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did I say the handsomest? Oh dear, I mean they select the most sedate—for, from this day she must never leave the temple, or converse with any except the priests.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Herbert.</SPEAKER>
<P>Except the priests! Go where you will, you find those gentlemen always contrive to be well taken care of—would you like to be∣come a priestess?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nelti </SPEAKER>
<STAGE>[sighing.]</STAGE>
<P>Last night perhaps I should.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Herbert.</SPEAKER>
<P>Charming sensibility! and may I, my sweet girl, interpret that sigh in my favour?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nelti.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, you will not love me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Herbert.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not love thee!—By Magna Charta, I'll resign my life, fortune, and liberty to thee.— besides, I'll bring thee beads, cloathes, music—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nelti.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, that is not love.—They only try to please the eye, who find their actions cannot touch the heart.—no presents or toys could in∣fluence Nelti.—no, not if you were to give her an iron javelin and a tame tiger.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Herbert.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed!—very delicate presents for a young lady.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nelti </SPEAKER>
<STAGE>[aside.]</STAGE>
<P>I wish I cou'd make him love me— how do women in England gain their lover's hearts?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Herbert.</SPEAKER>
<P>Generally by using them like dogs.— for, when a woman studiously avoids looking at
<PB N="10" REF="16"/>a man, abuses him on all occasions, and is kind to every one else, we naturally conclude they love each other to distraction.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nelti .</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>[aside]</STAGE>
<P>I never can find in my heart to use him ill—What ugly thing is that?</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> Dolores <HI>and</HI> Bribon, <HI>from a boat.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Herbert.</SPEAKER>
<P>A doctor of physic, who having killed all his patients in the old world, except his wife, who wou'd never take his medicines, has ven∣tured hither, in pursuit of new patients, new fees, and perhaps a new bed-fellow.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nelti.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what's the other?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Herbert.</SPEAKER>
<P>A lawyer and a coxcomb.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nelti.</SPEAKER>
<P>What's a coxcomb?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Herbert.</SPEAKER>
<P>A reptile, my dear, that is found in abundance in all countries, and yet is not easily described—it is a kind of mongrel, which men drive from them, because they hardly consider it as belonging to them, and the women won't re∣ceive, because they think it won't breed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dolores.</SPEAKER>
<P>All seems pretty quiet.—I say, Bri∣bon—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bribon.</SPEAKER>
<P>What do you say, Doctor Dolores?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dolores.</SPEAKER>
<P>This seems cursed mild, wholesome, unprofitable air for a physician.—But heaven is merciful, wherever I go, patients increase.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bribon.</SPEAKER>
<P>There seems plenty of gold, and plen∣ty of gold, plenty of law, follows as naturally as a bill of costs.—I say, Doctor, do you see that sweet, pretty, wealthy-looking girl—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dolores.</SPEAKER>
<P>I fancy I shall have some pretty fe∣male practice here.—I was a great favourite in Spain; for my maxim was, always to stick to my friends to the last.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Herbert.</SPEAKER>
<P>Doctor, welcome to the new world.— So, you kept on board till all was quiet.</P>

<P>Alonzo, thy aid is now our chief reliance—Roldan prepares to attack us; and since the good Columbus left our coast, thro' many tedious months of care and danger, thy counsel and thy valour, still have been defence and safety to us. But, why droops the brave Alonzo?— If any tender scruple of shedding native blood now check thy wonted ardour, freely avow the generous weakness, —On thee depends our fate— yet would I welcome the loss of empire and of life, rather than save them by Alonzo's misery.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alonzo.</SPEAKER>
<P>No—With honest zeal I draw my sword against the enemies of innocence, tho' the same clime hath bred us.—He who regards his coun∣try's real honour, owns for his countrymen, none but the virtuous.—Yet, Orozimbo, this heart is bursting with its anguish.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alonzo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Does she, who, in the prime of youth, when every fine affection of the soul glows with its noblest fervour, when all the joys of life seem decked with magic splendour, does she deserve the punishment of guilt, who, buried in yon' ruthless prison, casts a fond thought on the de∣lights she has lost, dares to condemn the tyranny which binds her, and claims her right to liberty and love?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Orozimbo.</SPEAKER>
<P>I would aspire to reign beyond the limits of weak prejudice; but reflect, Alonzo, how sacred are a country's customs.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alonzo.</SPEAKER>
<P>There, there's the source of half the misery of human kind—custom is the vile con∣founder of virtue and of vice.—It checks the operation of our godlike reason, and makes the greatest glory of creation, a being void of will— Oh, Orozimbo, soar superior to the mists of error —when thy great soul displays unmanacled its glo∣rious attributes—thou'lt cease to think that God delights in cruelty, whose blest infusion in the human heart breathes mercy and benevolence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Orozimbo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oft have I admired thy wisdom and thy virtue; but, now methinks, in thee I hear the voice of heaven, and it shall be obeyed.— But I must praise thy wonderous goodness, which can thus plead for other's misery.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alonzo.</SPEAKER>
<P>There I am unworthy of thy praise— mine is a selfish zeal—I've sued for one whom I adore; nay for myself I've sued.—Oh, Orozimbo, in the repeal of an inhuman law, thou hast re∣stored my forfeit life—nay more—the life of her I love.</P>

<L>"Sir, here's my <HI>card,</HI> for <HI>damme I am—I."—</HI></L>
<L>Thus is the boy, intent to ape the man,</L>
<L>A puff of discord, and a flash in pan.—</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In married life, resolving each to drive,</L>
<L>A sweet contention keeps the flame alive;</L>
<L>"I know my province—so do I, my Lady—</L>
<L>"You'll prove my torment—you've proved mine al∣ready.</L>
<L>"To guard my rights, my Lord, I must endeavour—</L>
<L>"You're always out—and you are out for ever—</L>
<L>"Then both I trust are happy, <HI>sposo caro</HI>— <STAGE>with ironical tenderness)</STAGE></L>
<L>"You throw at <HI>hazard,</HI> and I punt at <HI>pharo;</HI></L>
<L>"Each have their object—so resentment smother—</L>
<L>"Hold out the olive <HI>branch,</HI> or wear another."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Suffice this raillery—enough to prove,</L>
<L>Our noblest conquest, is our own self-love;</L>
<L>The Author, who to night has greatly dar'd,</L>
<L>To brave the issue of your high award;</L>
<L>Tho' old, the legend whence his scenes he drew,</L>
<L>Humbly presumes, the inserence may be new;</L>
<L>Should then the efforts of his untaught muse,</L>
<L>By just, tho' small desert, his flights excuse;</L>
<L>Let him enjoy, for all his anxious toils,</L>
<L>That bright reward—the triumph of your smiles.</L>
