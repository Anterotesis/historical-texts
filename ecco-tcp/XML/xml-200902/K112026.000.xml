<HEAD>TO Sir ROGER MOSTYN, Bart. OF MOSTYN, FLINTSHIRE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>A Gentleman well known to the political world in the begin∣ning of the present century made the tour of <HI>Europe,</HI> and before he reached <HI>Abbeville</HI> discovered that in order to see a country to best advantage it was infinitely preferable to travel by day than by night.</P>
<P>I cannot help making this appli∣cable to myself, who, after publish∣ing three volumes of the <HI>Zoology</HI> of GREAT BRITAIN, found out that to
<PB N="iv" REF="3"/>
be able to speak with more precision of the subjects I treated of, it was far more prudent to visit the whole than part of my country: struck therefore with the reflection of hav∣ing never seen SCOTLAND, I instantly ordered my baggage to be got ready, and in a reasonable time found my∣self on the banks of the <HI>Tweed.</HI></P>
<P>As soon as I communicated to you my resolution, with your accustomed friendship you wished to hear from me: I could give but a partial per∣formance of my promise, the atten∣tion of a traveller being so much taken up as to leave very little room for the discharge of epistolary duties; and I flatter myself you will find this tardy execution of my engagement more satisfactory than the hasty ac∣counts I could send you on my road: but this is far from being the sole motive of this address.</P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="4"/>
I have irresistable inducements of public and of a private nature: to you I owe a most free enjoyment of the little territories Providence had bestowed on me; for by a liberal and equal cession of fields, and meads and woods, you connected all the divided parts, and gave a full scope to all my improvements. Every view I take from my window reminds me of my debt, and forbids my silence, causing the pleasing glow of gratitude to diffuse itself over the whole frame, instead of forcing up the imbittering sigh of <HI>Oh! si angulus ille!</HI> Now every scene I enjoy receives new charms, for I mingle with the visible beauties, the more pleasing idea of owing them to you, the worthy neighbor and firm friend, who are happy in the calm and domestic paths of life with abilities superior to oftentation, and
<PB N="vi" REF="5"/>
goodness content with its own re∣ward: with a sound judgement and honest heart you worthily discharge the senatorial trust reposed in you, whose unprejudiced vote aids to still the madness of the People, or aims to check the presumption of the Minister. My happiness in being from your earliest life your neighbor, makes me confident in my observa∣tion; your increasing and discerning band of friends discovers and con∣firms the justice of it: may the reasons that attract and bind us to you ever remain, is the most grate∣full wish that can be thought of, by</P>

<HEAD>A TOUR IN SCOTLAND. MDCCLXIX.</HEAD>
<P>ON <HI>Monday</HI> the 26th of JUNE take my depar∣ture from CHESTER,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHESTER.</NOTE> a city without parallel for the singular structure of the four princi∣pal, streets, which are as if excavated out of the earth, and sunk many feet beneath the surface; the carriages drive far beneath the level of the kitchens, on a line with ranges of shops, over which on each side of the streets passengers walk from end to end, in covered galleries, secure from wet or heat. The back courts of all these houses are level with the ground, but to go into any of these four streets it is necessary to descend a flight of several steps.</P>
<P>The <HI>Cathedral</HI> is an antient structure, very ragged on the outside, from the nature of the red friable stone <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Saxum arenarium friabile rubrum <HI>Da Costa fossils.</HI> I. 139.</NOTE> with which it is built: the tabernacle work in the choir is very neat; but the beauty, and elegant simplicity of a very antique gothic chapter-house, is what merits a visit from every traveller.</P>
<P>The <HI>Hypocaust</HI> near the <HI>Feathers</HI> Inn, is one of the remains of the <HI>Romans</HI><NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">This city was the <HI>Deva</HI> and <HI>Devana</HI> of <HI>Antonine,</HI> and the sta∣tion of the <HI>Legia vicessima victrix.</HI></NOTE>, it being well known that this place was a principal station. Among
<PB N="2" REF="9"/>
many antiquities found here, none is more singular than the rude sculpture of the <HI>Dea Armigera Miner∣va,</HI> with her bird and her altar on the face of a rock in a small field near the <HI>Welch</HI> end of the bridge.</P>
<P>The castle is a decaying pile. The walk of the city, the only complete specimens of antient for∣tifications, are kept in excellent order, being the principal walk of the inhabitants; the views from the several parts are very fine; the mountains of <HI>Flintshire,</HI> the hills of <HI>Broxton,</HI> and the insulated rock of <HI>Beeston,</HI> form the ruder part of the scenery; a rich flat forms the softer view, and the prospect up the river towards <HI>Boughton,</HI> recalls in some de∣gree the idea of the <HI>Thames</HI> and <HI>Richmond</HI> hill.</P>
<P>Passed thro' <HI>Tarvin,</HI> a small village; in the church-yard is an epitaph in memory of Mr. <HI>John Thomasen,</HI> an excellent penman, but particularly famous for his exact and elegant imitation of the <HI>Greek</HI> character.</P>
<P><HI>Delamere,</HI> which <HI>Leland</HI> calls a faire and large forest, with plenty of redde deer and falow, is now a black and dreary waste; it feeds a few rabbets, and a few black <HI>Terns</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Br. Zool.</HI> II. 430.</NOTE> skim over the splashes that water some part of it.</P>
<P>A few miles from this heath lies <HI>Northwich,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Salt Pi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s.</NOTE> a small town, long famous for its rock salt, and brine pits; some years ago I visited one of the mines; the stratum of salt lies about forty yards thick; that which I saw was hollowed into the form of a temple; I descended thro' a dome, and found the roof supported by rows of pillars, about two
<PB N="3" REF="10"/>
yards thick, and several in height; the whole was illuminated with numbers of candles, and made a most magnificent and glittering appearance. Above the salt is a bed of whitish clay<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Argilla caerula-cinerea <HI>Da Costa fossils.</HI> I. 48.</NOTE>, used in making the <HI>Liverpool</HI> earthen-ware; and in the same place is also dug a good deal of the <HI>Gypsum,</HI> or plaister stone. The fossil salt is generally yellow, and semi∣pellucid, sometimes debased with a dull greenish earth, and is often found, but in small quantities, quite clear and color-less.</P>
<P>The road from this place to <HI>Macclesfield</HI> is thro' a flat, rich, but unpleasant country. That town is in a very flourishing state, is possessed of a great manufacture of mohair and twist buttons; has be∣tween twenty and thirty silk mills, and a very con∣siderable copper smelting house, and brass work.</P>
<P>After leaving this place the country almost in∣stantly changes and becomes very mountanous and barren, at left on the surface; but the bowels com∣pensate for the external sterility, by yielding suffi∣cient quantity of coal for the use of the neighboring parts of <HI>Cheshire,</HI> and for the burning of lime; vast quantity is made near <HI>Buxton,</HI> and being car∣ried to all parts for the purposes of agriculture, is become a considerable article of commerce.</P>
<P>The celebrated warm bath of BUXTON <NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">The <HI>Romans,</HI> who were remarkably fond of warm baths, did not over-look these agreeable waters; they had a bath, inclosed with a brick wall, adjacent to the present St. <HI>Anne</HI>'s well, which Dr. <HI>Short</HI> in his essay on mineral waters, says was razed in 1709.</NOTE> is seated in a bottom,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BUXTON.</NOTE> amidst these hills, in a most chearless spot, and would be little frequented, did not <HI>Hygeia</HI> often reside here, and dispense to her
<PB N="4" REF="11"/>
votaries the chief blessings of life, ease and health with joy and gratitude I this moment reflect on the efficacious qualities of the waters; I recollect with rapture the return of spirits, the flight of pain, and re-animation of my long, long crippled rheumatic limbs. But how unfortunate is it, that what Pro∣vidence designed for the general good, should be rendered only a partial one, and denied to all, ex∣cept the opulent or I may say to the (compara∣tively) few that can get admittance into the house where these waters are imprisoned. There are other springs (<HI>Cambden</HI> says nine) very near that in the <HI>Hall,</HI> and in all probability of equal virtue. I was informed that the late Duke of <HI>Devonshire,</HI> not long before his death, had ordered some of these to be inclosed and formed into baths. It is to be hoped that his successor will not fail adopting so usefull and humane a plan; that he will form it on the most enlarged system, that they may open not solely to these whom misused wealth hath rendered invalids, but to the poor cripple, whom honest labor hath made a burden to himself and his country; and to the soldier and sailor, who by hard service have lost the use ot those very limbs which once were active in our defence. The honor resulting from such a foundation would be as great, as the satisfaction arising from a consciousness of so benevolent a work would be unspeakable; the charms of dissipation would then lose their force, and dull and tasteless would every human luxury appear to him who had it in his power thus to lay open these fountains of health, and to be able to exult in such pathetic and comfortable strains as these: <HI>When the ear heard me,</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="12"/>
<HI>then it blessed me, and when the eye saw me it gave witness to me;</HI></P>
<P><HI>Because I delivered the poor that cried, and the fa∣therless, and him that had none to help him.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me, and I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I was eyes to the blind, and feet was I to the lame.</HI></P>
<P>After leaving <HI>Buxton,</HI> passed thro' <HI>Middleton</HI> dale, a deep narrow chasm between two vast cliffs, which extend on each side near a mile in length: this road is very singular, but the rocks in general are too naked to be beautifull. At the end is the small village of <HI>Stoney Middleton;</HI> here the prospect opens, and at <HI>Barsly Bridge</HI> exhibits a pretty view of a small but fertile vale, watered by the <HI>Derwent,</HI> and terminated by <HI>Chatsworth,</HI> and its plantations. Arrived and lay at</P>
<P><HI>Chesterfield;</HI> an ugly town. There is here a great manufacture of worsted stockings, and another of a brown earthen-ware, much of which is sent into <HI>Holland;</HI> the clay is found near the town, over the bass or cherry<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Or flinty.</NOTE> stratum, above, the coal. The steeple of <HI>Chesterfield</HI> church is a spire, covered with lead, but by a violent wind strangely bent, in which state it remains.</P>
<P>In the road side, about three miles from the town,<NOTE PLACE="marg">JUNE 27.</NOTE> are several pits of iron stone, about nine or ten feet deep. The stratum lies above the coal, and is two feet thick. I was informed that the adventurers pay ten pounds per annum to the Lord of the Soil, for liberty of raising it; that the la∣borers
<PB N="6" REF="13"/>
borers have six shillings per load for getting it; each load is about twenty strikes or bushels, which yields a tun of metal. Coal, in these parts, is very cheap, a tun and a half being sold for five shillings.</P>
<P>Changed horses at <HI>Worksop</HI> and <HI>Tuxford;</HI> crossed the <HI>Trent</HI> at <HI>Dunham-Ferry,</HI> where it is broad but shallow; the spring tides flow here, and rise about two feet, but the common tides never reach this place. Pass along the <HI>Foss-Dyke,</HI> or the canal opened by <HI>Henry</HI> I.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dugdale</HI> on embanking, 167.</NOTE> to form a communication be∣tween the <HI>Trent</HI> and the <HI>Witham;</HI> it was opened<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I make use of this word, as Doctor <HI>Stukely</HI> conjectures this canal to have been originally a <HI>Roman</HI> work; and that another of the same kind (called the <HI>Cardike</HI>) communicated with it, by means of the <HI>Withan,</HI> which began a little below <HI>Washenbro',</HI> three miles from <HI>Lincoln,</HI> and was continued thro' the fens as far as <HI>Peterborough.</HI> The gentlemen who favored me with the account of the <HI>Cardike,</HI> referred me to <HI>Stukely</HI>'s <HI>Cerausius,</HI> and his life of <HI>Richard</HI> of <HI>Ciren∣cester,</HI> books I have not at present before me.</NOTE> the year 1121, and extends from <HI>Lincoln</HI> to <HI>Tor∣kesey;</HI> its length is eleven miles three quarters, the breadth between dike and dike at the top is about sixty feet, at bottom twenty-two; vessels from fif∣teen to thirty-five tuns navigate this canal, and by its means a considerable trade in coals, timber, corn and wool is carried on. In former times, the persons who had landed property on either side were obliged to scower it whenever it was choaked up, and accordingly we find presentments were made by juries in several succeeding reigns for that purpose. Reach</P>
<P>LINCON, an antient but ill-built city, much fallen away from its former extent. It lies partly on a plain, partly on a very steep hill, on whose summit are the cathedral and the ruins of the castle. The first
<PB N="7" REF="14"/>
is a vast pile of gothic architecture; has nothing remarkable on the outside, but within is of match∣less beauty and magnificence: the ornaments are excessively rich, and in the finest gothic taste; the pillars light, the centre losty, and of a surprising grandeur. The windows at the N. and S. ends very antient, but very elegant; one represents a leaf with its fibres, the other consists of a number of small circles. There are two other antient win∣dows on each side the great isle: the others, as I recollect, are modern. This church was, till of late years, much out of repair, but has just been restored in a manner that does credit to the Chapter. There is indeed a sort of arch near the W. end, that seems placed there (for the same end as <HI>Bayes</HI> tells us he wrote one of his scenes) meerly to set off the rest.</P>
<P>The prospect from this eminence is very exten∣sive, but very barren of objects, a vast flat as far as the eye can reach, consisting of plains not the most fertile, or of fens <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The fens, naked as they now appear, were once well wooded; oaks have been found buried in them, which were sixteen yards long, and five in circumference; fir trees from thirty to thirty-five yards long, and a foot or eighteen inches square. These trees had not the mark of the ax, but appeared as if burnt down by fire ap∣plied to their lower parts. Acorns and small nuts have also been found in great quantities in the same places. <HI>Dugdale</HI> on embank∣ing, 141.</NOTE> and moors: the last are far less extensive than they were, many being drained, and will soon become the best land in the country. But still much remains to be done; the fens near <HI>Revesby-Abby,</HI> eight miles beyond <HI>Horn∣castle,</HI> are of vast extent; but serve for little other purpose than the rearing great numbers of geese, which are the wealth of the fenmen.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="15"/>
During the breeding season,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Geese.</NOTE> these birds are lodged in the same houses with the inhabitants, and even in their very bed-chambers: in every appart∣ment are three rows of coarse wicker pens placed one above another; each bird has its separate lodge divided from the other, which it keeps possession of during the time of sitting. A person, called a <HI>Gozzard</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">i. e. Goose-herd.</NOTE>, attends the flock, and twice a day drives the whole to water; then brings them back to their habitations, helping those that live in the upper stories to their nests, without ever misplacing a single bird.</P>
<P>The geese are plucked five times in the year; the first plucking is at <HI>Lady-Day,</HI> for feathers and quils, and the same is renewed, for feathers only, four times more between that and <HI>Michaelmas.</HI> The old geese submit quietly to the operation, but the young ones are very noisy and unruly. I once saw this performed, and observed that goslins of six weeks old were not spared; for their tails were plucked, as I was told, to habituate them early to what they were to come to. If the season proves cold, numbers of geese die by this barbarous cus∣tom <NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">It was also practised by the antients. <HI>Candidorum alterum vec∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>gal: Velluntar quibusdam loc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> his anno.</HI> Plinii lib. x. c. 22.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Vast numbers are drove annually to <HI>London,</HI> to supply the markets; among them, all the super∣annuated geese and ganders (called here <HI>Cagmags</HI>) which serve to fatigue the jaws of the good Citizens, who are so unfortunate as to meet with them.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="16"/>
The fen called the <HI>West Fen,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Fen birds.</NOTE> is the place where the Ruffs and Reeves resort to in the greatest num∣bers <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Br. Zool.</HI> II. 363. <HI>Suppl. tab.</HI> xv. <HI>p.</HI> 22.</NOTE>; and many other sorts of water fowl, which do not require the shelter of reeds or rushes, mi∣grate here to breed; for this fen is very bare, having been imperfectly drained by narrow canals, which intersect it for great numbers of miles. These the inhabitants navigate in most diminutive shallow boats; they are, in fact, the roads of the country.</P>
<P>The <HI>East Fen</HI> is quite in a state of nature, and gives a specimen of the country before the intro∣duction of drainage: it is a vast tract of morass, intermixed with numbers of lakes, from half a mile to two or three miles in circuit, communicating with each other by narrow reedy straits: they are very shallow, none are above four or five feet in depth; but abound with fish, such as Pike, Pearch, Ruff, Bream, Tench, Rud, Dace, Roach, Bur∣bolt, Sticklebacks and Eels. The fen is covered with reeds, the harvest of the neighboring inhabi∣tants, who mow them annually; for they prove a much better thatch than straw, and not only cot∣tages but many very good houses are covered with them. Stares, which during winter resort in my∣riads to roost in the reeds, are very destructive, by breaking them down by the vast numbers that perch on them. The people are therefore very diligent in their attempts to drive them away, and are at great expence in powder to free themselves from these troublesome guests. I have seen a stock of reeds harvested and stacked worth two or three
<PB N="10" REF="17"/>
hundred pounds, which was the property of a single farmer.</P>
<P>The birds which inhabit the different fens are verv numerous: I never met with a finer field for the Zoologist to range in. Besides the common Wild-duck, of which an account is given in another place <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Br. Zool.</HI> II. 462. In general, to avoid repetition, the reader is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>err'd to the four <HI>Octavo</HI> volumes of <HI>British</HI> Zoology, for a more particular account of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> mentioned in this Tour.</NOTE>, wild Geese, Garganies, Pochards, Sho∣velers and Teals, breed here. I have seen on the <HI>East Fen</HI> a small flock of the tusted Ducks; but they seemed to make it only a baiting place. The Pewit Gulls and black Terns abound; the last in vast flocks almost deafen one with their clamors: a few of the great Terns, or Tickets, are seen among them. I saw several of the great crested Grebes on the <HI>East Fen,</HI> called there <HI>Gaunts,</HI> and met with one of their floating nests with eggs in it. The lesser crested Grobe, the black and dusky Grebe, and the little Grebe, are also inhabitants of the fens; toge∣ther with Coots, Water-hens, spotted Water-hens, Water-rails, Ruffs, Redshanks, Lapwings or Wipes, Red-breasted Godwits and Whimbrels. The God∣wits breed near <HI>Weshenbrough;</HI> the Whimbrels only appear for about a fortnight in <HI>May</HI> near <HI>Spalding,</HI> and then quit the country. Opposite to <HI>Fossdyke Wash,</HI> during summer, are great numbers of <HI>Avo∣settas,</HI> called there <HI>Yelpers,</HI> from their cry: they hover over the sportsman's head like the Lapwing, and fly with their necks and legs extended.</P>
<P>Knots are taken in nets along the shores near <HI>Foss∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yke</HI> in great numbers during winter; but they dis∣appear in the spring.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="18"/>
The short-eared owl, <HI>Br. Zool.</HI> I. 156. visits the neighborhood of <HI>Washenbrough,</HI> along with the Woodcocks, and probably performs its migrations with those birds, for it is observed to quit the coun∣try at the same time: I have also received specimens of them from the <HI>Danish</HI> dominions, one of the re∣treats of the Woodcock. This owl is not observed in this county to perch on trees, but conceals itself in long old grass; if disturbed, takes a short flight, lights again and keeps staring about, during which time its horns are very visible. The farmers are fond of the arrival of these birds, as they clear the fields of mice, and will even fly in search of prey during day, provided the weather is cloudy and misty.</P>
<P>But the greatest curiosity in these parts is the vast Herony at <HI>Cressi-Hall,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Heronry.</NOTE> six miles from <HI>Spalding.</HI> The Herons resort there in <HI>February</HI> to repair their nests, settle there in the spring to breed, and quit the place during winter. They are numerous as Rooks, and their nests so crouded together, that myself and the company that was with me counted not fewer than eighty in one tree. I here had opportunity of de∣tecting my own mistake, and that of other Ornitho∣logists, in making two species of Herons; for I found that the crested Heron was only the male of the other: it made a most beautifull appearance with its snowy neck and long crest streaming with the wind. The family who owned this place was of the same name with these birds, which seems to be the principal inducement for preserving them.</P>

<P>Visited <HI>Spalding,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">JUNE 28, <HI>Spalding.</HI></NOTE> a place very much resembling, in form, neatness, and situation, a <HI>Dutch</HI> town: the river <HI>Welland</HI> passes through one of the streets, a canal is cut through another, and trees are planted on each side. The church is a handsome structure, the steeple a spire. The churches in general, throughout this low tract, are very handsome; all are built of stone, which must have been brought from places very remote along temporary canals; for, in many instances, the quarries lie at lest twenty miles distant. But these aedifices were built in zealous ages, when the benedictions or maledictions of the church made the people conquer every diffi∣culty that might obstruct these pious foundations. The abby of <HI>Crowland,</HI> seated in the midst of a snaking fen, is a curious monument of the insu∣perable zeal of the times it was erected in; as the beautifull tower of <HI>Boston</HI> church, visible from all parts, is a magnificent specimen of a fine gothic taste.</P>

Returned thro' <HI>Lincoln,</HI> went out of town under the <HI>Newport-Gate,</HI> a curious <HI>Roman</HI> work; passed over part of the heath, changed horses at <HI>Spittle,</HI> and at <HI>Glanford-Bridge,</HI> dined at the ferry-house on the banks of the <HI>Humber,</HI> and after a passage of about five miles, with a brisk gale, landed at <HI>Hull,</HI> and reached that night <HI>Burton-Constable,</HI> the seat of Mr. <HI>Constable,</HI> in that part of <HI>Yorkshire</HI> called <HI>Hol∣derness;</HI> a dull, flat country, but excellent for pro∣ducing large cattle, and a good breed of horses, whose prices are near doubled since the <HI>French</HI> have grown so fond of the <HI>English</HI> kind.</P>
<P>Made an excursion to <HI>Hornsea,</HI> a small town on the coast, remarkable only for its mere, a piece of water about two miles long, and one broad, fa∣mous for its pike and eels; it is divided from the sea by a very narrow bank, so is in much danger of being sometime or other lost.</P>
<P>The cliffs on the coast of <HI>Holderness</HI> are high, and composed of clay, which falls down in vast fragments.

<P>A mile from hence is the town of <HI>Burlington.</HI> The body of the church is large, but the steeple, by some accident, has been destroyed; near it is a large gateway, with a noble gothic arch, possibly the remains of a priory of black canons, founded by <HI>Walter de Gant,</HI> in the beginning of the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> I.</P>
<P>This coast of the kingdom is very unfavourable to trees, for, except some woods in the neighbor∣hood of <HI>Burton-Constable</HI> there is a vast nakedness from the <HI>Humber,</HI> as far as the extremity of <HI>Caith∣ness,</HI> with a very few exceptions, which shall be noted in their proper places.</P>
<P>Went to <HI>Flamborough</HI>-Head.<NOTE PLACE="marg">JULY 3, <HI>Flamborough-Head.</HI></NOTE> The town is on the North side, consists of about one hundred and fifty small houses, entirely inhabited by fishermen, few of whom, as is said, die in their beds, but meet their fate in the element they are so conver∣sant in. Put myself under the direction of <HI>William Camidge,</HI> Ciceroni of the place, who conducted me to a little creek at that time covered with fish, a fleet of cobles having just put in. Went in one of those little boats to view the <HI>Head,</HI> coasting it for upwards of two miles. The cliffs are of a tre∣mendous height, and amazing grandeur; beneath are several vast caverns, some closed at the end,
<PB N="15" REF="22"/>
others are pervious, formed with a natural arch, giving a romantic passage to the boat, different from that we entered. In some places the rocks are in∣sulated, are, of a pyramidal figure, and soar up to a vast height; the bases of most are solid, but in some pierced thro', and arched; the color of all these rocks is white, from the dung of the innu∣merable flocks of migratory birds,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Its birds.</NOTE> which quite cover the face of them, filling every little projec∣tion, every little hole that will give them leave to rest; multitudes were swimming about, others swarmed in the air, and almost stunned us with the variety of their croaks and screams; I observed among them corvorants, shags in small flocks, guillemots, a few black guillemots very shy and wild, auks, pussins, kittiwakes <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Called here <HI>Petrels. Br. Zool. Suppl. tab.</HI> xxiii. <HI>p.</HI> 26.</NOTE>, and herring gulls. Landed at the same place, but before our return to <HI>Flamborough,</HI> visited <HI>Robin Leith</HI>'s hole, a vast cavern, to which there is a narrow passage from the land side; it suddenly rises to a great height, the roof is finely arched, and the bottom is for a considerable way formed in broad steps, re∣sembling a great but easy ftair-case; the mouth opens to the sea, and gives light to the whole.</P>

<P><HI>Filey Brig</HI> is a ledge of rocks running far into the sea, and often fatal to shipping. The bay is sandy, and affords vast quantities of fine fish, such

<P>Set out for <HI>Scarborough,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">JULY 4.</NOTE> passed near the site of <HI>Flixton,</HI> a hospital founded in the time of <HI>Athelstan,</HI> to give shelter to travellers from the <HI>wolves, that they should not be devoured by them</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Cambden Brit.</HI> II. 902.</NOTE>; so that in those days this bare tract must have been covered with wood, for those ravenous animals ever inhabit large forests. These <HI>hospitia</HI> are not unfrequent among the <HI>Alps;</HI> are either appendages to religious houses, or supported by voluntary subscriptions. On the spot where <HI>Flixton</HI> stood is a farm-house, to this day called the <HI>Spital</HI> House. Reach</P>
<P>SCARBOROUGH, a large town, built in form of a crescent on the sides of a deep hill; at one extre∣mity are the ruins of the castle seated on a cliff of a stupendous height, from whence is a very good view of the town. In the castle-yard is a handsome barrack for one hundred and fifty men, but at pre∣sent untenanted by soldiery. Beneath, on the south side, is a large stone pier, (another is now build∣ing) which shelters the shipping belonging to the town. It is a place absolutely without trade, yet owns above 300 sail of ships, which are hired out for freight: in the late war the Government had never less than 100 of them in pay.</P>
<P>The number of inhabitants belonging to this place are above 10,000, but as great part are sailors, nothing like that number are resident, which makes one church sufficient for those who live on shore. It is large, and seated almost on
<PB N="17" REF="24"/>
the top of the hill. The range of buildings on the <HI>Cliff</HI> commands a fine view of the castle, town, and shore, and of innumerable shipping that are perpetually passing backward and forward on their voyages. The spaw <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The waters are impregnated with a purgative salt, (<HI>Glauber</HI>'s) a small quantity of common salt, and of steel. There are two wells, the ferthest from the town is more purgative, and its taste more bitter; the other is more chalybeate, and ita taste more brisk and pungent. D. H.</NOTE> lies at the foot of one of the hills, S. of the town; this and the great conveni∣ency of sea-bathing, occasion a vast resort of com∣pany during summer; it is at that time a place of great gayety, for with numbers health is the pre∣tence, but dissipation the end.</P>
<P>The shore is a fine hard sand, and during low water is the place where the company amuse them∣selves with riding. This is also the fish market; for every day the cobles, or little fishing boats, are drawn on shore here, and lie in rows, often quite loaden with variety of the best fish. There was a fisherman, on the 9th of <HI>May,</HI> 1767, brought in at one time, 20 Cods, 14 Lings, 17 Skates, 8 Holibuts, besides a vast quantity of lesser fish; and sold the whole for 3l. 15s. It is superfluous to repeat what has been before mentioned, of the me∣thods of fishing, being amply described <HI>Vol.</HI> III. p. 193, of the <HI>British Zoology;</HI> yet it will be far from impertinent to point out the peculiar advantages of these seas, and the additional benefit this town might
<PB N="18" REF="25"/>
experience, by the augmentation of its fisheries. For this account, and for numberless civilities, I think myself much indebted to Mr. <HI>Travis,</HI> fur∣geon, who communicated to me the following Re∣marks:</P>
<P><HI>Scarborough</HI> is situated at the bottom of a bay, formed by <HI>Whitby</HI> rock on the North, and <HI>Flambo∣rough</HI>-head on the South; the town is seated directly opposite to the centre of the W. end of the <HI>Dogger</HI> bank; which end, (according to <HI>Hammond</HI>'s chart of the North Sea) lies S. and by W. and N. and by E. but by a line drawn from <HI>Tinmouth</HI> castle, would lead about N. W. and S. E. Tho' the <HI>Dog∣ger</HI> bank is therefore but 12 leagues from <HI>Flambo∣rough</HI>-head, yet it is 16 and a half from <HI>Scarborough,</HI> 23 from <HI>Whitby,</HI> and 36 from <HI>Tinmouth</HI> castle. The N. side of the bank stretches off E. N. E. between 30 and 40 leagues, untill it almost joins to the <HI>Long-Bank,</HI> and <HI>Jutt</HI>'s Riff.</P>
<P>It is to be remarked, that the fishermen seldom find any Cod, Ling, or other round fish upon the <HI>Dogger</HI> bank itself, but on the sloping edges and hollows contiguous to it. The top of the bank is covered with a barren shifting sand, which affords them no subsistence; and the water on it, from its shallowness, is continually so agitated and broken, as to allow them no time to rest. The flat fish do not suffer the same inconvenience there; for when disturbed by the motion of the sea, they shelter themselves in the sand, and find variety of suitable food. It is true, the <HI>Dutch</HI> fish upon the <HI>Dogger</HI> bank, but it is also true they take little except Soles, Skates, Thornbacks, Plaise, &amp;c. It is in the hol∣lows
<PB N="19" REF="26"/>
between the <HI>Dogger</HI> and the <HI>Well-Bank,</HI> that the Cod are taken, which supply <HI>London</HI> market.</P>
<P>The shore, except at the entrance of <HI>Scarbo∣rough</HI> pier, and some few other places, is com∣posed of covered rocks, which abound with Lobsters and Crabs, and many other shell fish, (no Oysters) thence, after a space covered with clean sand, extending in different places from one to five or six miles. The bottom, all the way to the edge of the <HI>Dogger</HI> banks, is a scar; in some places very rugged, rocky, and cavernous; in others smooth, and overgrown with variety of submarine plants, Mosses, Corallines, &amp;c. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I met with on the shores near <HI>Scarborough,</HI> small fragments of the true red coral.</NOTE> some parts again are spread with sand and shells; others, for many leagues in length, with soft mud and ooze, furnished by the discharge of the <HI>Tees</HI> and <HI>Humber.</HI></P>
<P>Upon an attentive review of the whole, it may be clearly inferred, that the shore along the coast on the one hand, with the edges of the <HI>Dogger</HI> bank on the other, like the sides of a decoy, give a direction towards our fishing grounds to the mighty shoals of Cod, and other fish, which are well known to come annually from the Northern ocean into our seas; and secondly, that the great variety of fishing grounds near <HI>Scarborough,</HI> extending upwards of 16 leagues from the shore, afford secure retreats and plenty of proper food for all the various kinds of fish, and also suitable places for each kind to de∣posit their spawn in.</P>
<P>The fishery at <HI>Scarbarough</HI> only employs 105 men, and brings in about 5250l. per annum, a
<PB N="20" REF="27"/>
trifle to what it would produce, was there a canal from thence to <HI>Leeds</HI> and <HI>Manchester;</HI> it is proba∣ble it would then produce above ten times that sum, employ some thousands of men, give a comfortable and cheap subsistence to our manufacturers, keep the markers moderately reasonable, enable our manu∣facturing towns to underfell our rivals, and prevent the hands, as is too often the case, raising insur∣rections, in every year of scarcity, natural or artificial.</P>
<P>On discoursing with some very intelligent fisher∣men, I was informed of a very singular phoenomenon they annually observe about the spawning of fish<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Os<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>k</HI> observed the same in <HI>S. Lat.</HI> 35, 36, in his return from <HI>China.</HI> The seamen call it the flowering of the water. <HI>Vol.</HI> 1l. 72.</NOTE>. At the distance of 4 or 5 leagues from shore, during the months of <HI>July</HI> and <HI>August,</HI> it is remarked, that at the depth of 6 or 7 fathom from the surface, the water appears to be saturated with a thick jelly, filled with the <HI>Ova</HI> of fish, which reaches 10 or 12 fathoms deeper; this is known by its adhering to the ropes the cobles anchor with when they are fishing, for they find the first 6 or 7 fathom of rope free from spawn, the next 10 or 12 covered with slimy matter, the remainder again free to the bot∣tom. They suppose this gelatinous stuff to supply the new-born fry with food, and that it is also a protection to the spawn, as being disagreeable to the larger fish to swim in.</P>
<P>There is great variety of fish brought on shore; besides those described as <HI>British</HI> fish, were two spe∣cies of Rays: the Whip-Ray has also been taken
<PB N="21" REF="28"/>
here, and another species of Weever; but these are subjects more proper to be referred to a <HI>Fauna,</HI> than an Itinerary, for a minute description.</P>
<P>Left <HI>Scarborough,</HI> passed over large moors to <HI>Robin Hood's Bay.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">JULY 10.</NOTE> On my round, observed the vast mountains of alum stone,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Alum Works.</NOTE> from which that salt is thus extracted: It is first calcined in great heaps, which continue burning by its own phlo∣giston, after being well set on fire by coals, for six, ten, or fourteen months, according to the size of the heap, some being equal to a small hill. It is then thrown into pits and steeped in water, to ex∣tract all the saline particles. The liquor is then run into other pits, where the vitriolic salts are precipitated, by the addition of a solution of the <HI>sal sode,</HI> prepared from kelp; or by the volatile <HI>alkali</HI> of stale urine. The superfluous water being then evaporated duely by boiling in large furnaces, the liquor is set to cool; and lastly, is poured into large casks, to crystallize.</P>
<P>The alum works of this county are of some an∣tiquity; they were first discovered by Sir <HI>Thomas Chaloner,</HI> in the reign of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> who observing the trees tinged, with an unusual color, made him suspicious of its being owing to some mineral in the neighborhood. He found out that the strata abounded with an aluminous salt.</P>
<P>At that time, the <HI>English</HI> being strangers to the method of managing it, there is a tradition that Sir <HI>Thomas</HI> was obliged to seduce some workmen from the <HI>Pope</HI>'s alum-works near <HI>Rome,</HI> then the greatest in <HI>Europe.</HI> If one may judge from the curse which his Holiness thundered out against Sir <HI>Thomas</HI> and
<PB N="22" REF="29"/>
the sugitives, he certainly was not a little enraged; for he cursed by the very form that <HI>Ernulphus</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide <HI>Tristram Shandy.</HI></NOTE> has left us, and not varied a tittle from that most com∣prehensive of imprecations.</P>
<P>The first pits were near <HI>Gisborough,</HI> the seat of the <HI>Chaloners,</HI> who still flourish there, notwithstand∣ing his Holiness's <HI>anathema.</HI> The works were so valuable as to be deemed a royal mine. Sir <HI>Paul Pindar,</HI> who rented them, payed annually to the King 12,500l. to the Earl of <HI>Mulgrave</HI> 1,640l. to Sir <HI>William Pennyman</HI> 600l. kept 800 workmen in pay, and sold his alum at 26l. per tun. But this monopoly was destroyed on the death of <HI>Charles</HI> I. and the right restored to the proprietors.</P>
<P>In these alum rocks are frequently found <HI>cornua ammonis,</HI> and other fossils,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jet.</NOTE> lodged in a stony nodule. Jet is sometimes met with in thin flat pieces, externally of the appearance of wood. Ac∣cording to <HI>Solinus, Britain</HI> was famous for this fossil <NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">GAGATES <HI>hic plurimus optimusque est lapis: si decorem requiras, nigro gemmeus: si naturam aquâ ardet, oleo restinguitur: si potestatem attritu calefactus applicita detinet, atque succinum.</HI> C. xxiv.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The sands near <HI>Robin Hood</HI>'s village were covered with fish of several kinds, and with people who met the cobles in order to purchase their cargo: the place seemed as if a great fish fair had been held there; some were carrying off their bargains, others busied in curing the fish; and a little out at sea was a fleet of cobles and five men boats, and others arriving to discharge the capture of the preceding
<PB N="23" REF="30"/>
tides <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">From hence the fish are carried in machines to <HI>Derby, Lichfield, Birmingham,</HI> and <HI>Worcester:</HI> the towns whick lie beyond the last are supplied from the West of <HI>England.</HI></NOTE>. There are 36 of the first belonging to this little place. The houses here make a grotesque appearance, are scattered over the face of a steep cliff in a very strange manner, and fill every pro∣jecting ledge, one above another, in the same man∣ner as the peasants do in the rocky parts of <HI>China. Sand's End, Runwick,</HI> and <HI>Staitbes,</HI> three other fishing-towns on this coast, are (as I am told) built in the same manner.</P>
<P>The country through this day's journey was hilly, the coast high. Reach</P>
<P>WHITBY, called by the <HI>Saxons, Streaneshalch,</HI> or bay of the light-house, a large town, oddly situated between two hills, with a narrow channel running through the middle, extending about a mile farther up the vale, where it widens, and forms a bay. The two parts of the town are joined by a good draw-bridge, for the conveniency of letting the shipping pass. From this bridge are often taken the viviparous Blenny, whose back-bone is as green as that of the Sea Needle. The river that forms this harbor is the <HI>Esk,</HI> but its waters are very inconsiderable when the tide is out. Here is a pretty brisk trade in ship-building; but except that, a small manufacture of sail-cloth, and the hiring out of ships as at <HI>Scarborough,</HI> like that town it has scarce any commerce. It is computed there are about 270 ships belonging to this place. Of late, an attempt has been made to have a share in the <HI>Greenland</HI> fishery; four ships were sent out, and had very good success. There are very good dry
<PB N="24" REF="31"/>
docks towards the end of the harbor; and at the mouth a most beautifull pier. At this place is the first salmon-fishery on the coast.</P>
<P>On the hill above the S. side of the town is a fine ruin of St. <HI>Hilda</HI>'s church.<NOTE PLACE="marg">St. <HI>Hilda</HI>'s church.</NOTE> The site was given to that saint by <HI>Oswy,</HI> king of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> about A. D. 657; possibly in consequence of a vow he made to found half a dozen monasteries, and make his daughter a nun, should heaven favor his arms. St. <HI>Hilda</HI> founded a convent here for men and wo∣men, dedicated it to St. <HI>Peter,</HI> and put it under the direction of an abbess. This establishment was ruined by the excursions of the <HI>Danes;</HI> but after the conquest it was rebuilt, and filled with <HI>Bene∣dictines,</HI> by <HI>Walter de Percy.</HI> In less enlightened times it was believed that not a wild goose dared to fly over this holy ground, and if it ventured was sure to fall precipitate and perish in the attempt.</P>
<P>Went about two miles along the shore, then turned up into the country, a black and barren moor; observed on the right a vast artificial mount, or <HI>Tumulus,</HI> called <HI>Freeburgh</HI> Hill, a monument, in all probability, the work of the <HI>Danes,</HI> whose custom it was to fling up such <HI>Tumuli</HI> over the graves of their kings or leaders; or, in memory of the flain in general, upon the spot where they had obtained any great victory. It is possible that this mount owed its rise to the victory gained by <HI>Ivar,</HI> a <HI>Danish</HI> prince, over <HI>Ella,</HI> king of <HI>Bernicia,</HI> who was on his way from the North to succour <HI>Osbert;</HI> for we are told that <HI>Ivar,</HI> after defeating the last, went from <HI>York</HI> to meet <HI>Ella,</HI> and fought and flew him on his march.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="32"/>
At the end of this moor, about three miles from <HI>Gisborough,</HI> is a beautifull view over the remaining part of <HI>Yorkshire,</HI> towards <HI>Durham, Hartlepool,</HI> and the mouth of the <HI>Tees,</HI> which maeanders through a very rich tract. The country instantly assumes a new face; the road lies between most delightfull hills finely wooded, and the little vales between them very fertile: on some of the hills are the marks of the first alum works, which were discovered by Sir <HI>Thomas Chaloner.</HI></P>
<P>GISBOROUGH, a small town, pleasantly situated in a vale,<NOTE PLACE="marg">GISBOROUGH.</NOTE> surrounded at some distance by hills, and open on the east to the sea, which is about five miles distant. It is certainly a delightfull spot, but I cannot see the reason why <HI>Cambden</HI> compares it to <HI>Puteoli.</HI> Here was once a priory of the canons of the order of St. <HI>Austin,</HI> founded by <HI>Robert de Brus,</HI> 1129, after the dissolution granted by <HI>Edward</HI> VI. to the <HI>Chaloners:</HI> a very beautifull east window of the church is still remaining. The town has at present a good manu∣facture of sail cloth.</P>
<P>The country continues very fine quite to the banks of the <HI>Tees,</HI> a considerable river, which di∣vides <HI>Yorkshire</HI> from the bishoprick of <HI>Durham.</HI> After travelling 109 miles in a strait line through the first, enter <HI>Durham,</HI> crossing the river on a very handsome bridge of arches, the battlements neatly panneled with stone; and reach</P>
<P>STOCKTON, lying on the <HI>Tees</HI> in form of a cres∣cent. A handsome town; the principal street is remarkably fine, being 165 feet broad; and several lesser streets run into it at right angles. In the mid∣dle of the great street are neat shambles, a town∣house,
<PB N="26" REF="33"/>
and large assembly-room. There is besides a large square. About a century ago, according to <HI>Anderson,</HI> it had scarce a house that was not made of clay and thatch; but is now a flourishing place. Its manufacture is sail cloth; and great quantities of corn, and lead, (from the mineral parts of the county) are sent off from hence by commission. As the river does not admit of large vessels so high as the town, those commodities are sent down to be shipped.</P>
<P>The salmon fishery here is neglected, for none are taken beyond what is necessary to supply the country. Smelts come up the river in the winter time. On the west side of the town stood the castle; what remained of it is at present converted into a barn. The country from hence to <HI>Durham</HI> is flat, very fertile, and much inclosed. Towards the west is a fine view of the highlands of the country: those hills are part of that vast ridge which commence in the north and deeply divide this portion of the kingdom; and on that account are called by <HI>Camb∣den</HI> the <HI>Appennines</HI> of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The approach to DURHAM is romantic,<NOTE PLACE="marg">DURHAM.</NOTE> through a deep hollow, cloathed on each side with wood. The city is pretty large, but the buildings old. Part are on a plain, part on the side of a hill. The abby, or cathedral, and the castle, where the Bishop lives when he resides here, are on the summit of a cliff, whose foot is washed on two sides by the river <HI>Were.</HI> The walks on rhe opposite banks are very beautifull, flagged in the middle and paved on the sides, and are well kept. They are cut through
<PB N="27" REF="34"/>
the wood, impend over the river, and receive a venerable improvement from the castle and antient cathedral which soar above.</P>
<P>The last is very old <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Begun in 1093, by Bishop <HI>William de Carilepho.</HI></NOTE>; plain without, and sup∣ported within by massy pillars, deeply engraved with lozenge-like figures, and zigzag furrows: others are plain; and each forms a cluster of pillars. The skreen to the choir is wood covered with a coarse carving. The choir neat, but without or∣nament.</P>
<P>The chapter-house seems very antient, and is in the form of a theatre. The cloisters large and handsome. All the monuments are defaced, ex∣cept that of Bishop <HI>Hatfield.</HI> The Prebendal houses are very pleasantly situated, and have a fine view backwards.</P>
<P>There are two handsome bridges over the <HI>Were</HI> to the walks; and a third covered with houses, which join the two parts of the town. This river produces Salmon, Trout, Roach, Dace, Minow, Loche, Bullhead, Sticklebacks, Lamprey, the lesser Lamprey, Eels, Smelts and Samlet, which are called here <HI>Rack-riders,</HI> because they appear in winter, or bad weather; <HI>Rack,</HI> in the northern dia∣lect, signifying the driving of the clouds by tem∣pests. It is observed here, that before they go off to spawn, those fish are covered with a white slime.</P>
<P>There is no inconsiderable manufacture, at <HI>Dur∣ham,</HI> of shalloons, tammies, stripes and callaman∣coes. I had heard on my road many complaints of the ecclesiastical government this county is subject
<PB N="28" REF="35"/>
to; but, from the general face of the country, it seems to thrive wonderfully under them.</P>
<P>Saw <HI>Coker,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">JULY 12.</NOTE> the seat of Mr. <HI>Car;</HI> a most romantic situation, layed out with great judgment; the walks are very extensive, principally along the sides or at the bottom of deep dells, bounded with vast preci∣pices, finely wooded; and many parts of the rocks are planted with vines, which I was told bore well, but late. The river <HI>Were</HI> winds along the hollows, and forms two very fine reaches at the place where you enter these walks. Its waters are very clear, and its bottom a solid rock. The view towards the ruins of <HI>Finchal</HI>-Abby is remarkably great; and the walk beneath the cliffs has a magnificent solemnity, a fit retreat for its monastic inhabitants. This was once called the Desert, and was the rude scene of the austerities of St. <HI>Godric,</HI> who carried them to the most senseless extravagance <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">St. <HI>Godric</HI> was born at <HI>Walpole</HI> in <HI>Norfolk,</HI> and being an itine∣rant merchant got acquainted with St. <HI>Cuthbtert</HI> at <HI>Farn Island.</HI> He made three pilgrimages to <HI>Jerusalem;</HI> at length, was warned by a vision to settle in the desert of <HI>Finchal.</HI> He lived a hermetical life there during 63 years, and practised unheard of austerities: he wore an iron shirt next his skin, day and night, and wore out three: he mingled ashes with the flower he made his bread of; and, least it should then be too good, kept it three or four months before he ventured to eat it. In winter, as well as summer, he passed whole nights, up to his chin in water, at his devotions. Like St. <HI>Antony,</HI> he was often haunted by fiends in various shapes; sometimes in form of beautifull damsels, so was visited with evil concupiscence, which he cured by rolling naked among thorns and briars: his body grew ulcerated; but, to encrease his pain, he poured salt into the wounds. Wrought many miracles, and died 1170. <HI>Britannia sacra,</HI> 304. About ten years after his decease, a <HI>Benedictine</HI> priory of thirteen monks was founded there in his honor, by <HI>Hugh Pudsey,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Durham.</HI></NOTE>. A sober mind may even at present be affected with horror at the prospect from the summits of the cliffs into a dark∣some and stupendous chasm, rendered still more

tremendous by the roaring of the waters over its distant bottom.</P>
<P>Passed through <HI>Chester-le-Street,</HI> a small town, near which is <HI>Lumly-Castle,</HI> the seat of the Earl of <HI>Scarborough;</HI> a place, as I was told, very well worth seeing; but unfortunately it proved a public day, and I lost sight of it. The country, from <HI>Durham</HI> to <HI>Newcastle,</HI> was very beautifull; the risings gentle, and prettily wooded, and the views agreeable; that on the borders remarkably fine, there being, from an eminence not far from the capital of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> an extensive view of a rich country, watered by the coaly <HI>Tyne.</HI> Reach</P>
<P>NEWCASTLE, a large, disagreeable, and dirty town,<NOTE PLACE="marg">NEWCASTLE.</NOTE> divided in two unequal parts by the river, and both sides very steep. The lower parts are inhabited by Keelmen and their families, a muti∣nous race; for which reason this town is always garrisoned.</P>
<P>The great business of the place is the coal trade. The collieries lie at different distances, from five to eighteen miles from the river; and the coal is brought down in waggons along rail roads, and discharged from covered buildings at the edge of the water into the keels or boats that are to convey it on shipboard. These boats are strong, clumsy and round, will carry about 25 tuns each; sometimes are navigated with a square sail, but generally are pushed along with large poles. No ships of large burthen can come up as high as <HI>Newcastle,</HI> but are obliged to lie at <HI>Shields,</HI> a few miles down the river, where stage coaches go thrice every day for the conveniency of passengers. This country is most
<PB N="30" REF="37"/>
remarkably populous; <HI>Newcastle</HI> alone contains near 40,000 inhabitants; and there are at lest 400 sail of ships belonging to that town and its port. The effect of the vast commerce of this place is very apparent for many miles round; the country is finely cultivated, and bears a most thriving and opulent aspect.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">JULY 13.</NOTE>Left <HI>Newcastle;</HI> the country in general flat; passed by a large stone column with three dials on the capital, with several scripture texts on the sides, called here <HI>Pigg</HI>'s Folly, from the founder.</P>
<P>A few miles further is <HI>Stannington</HI> Bridge, a plea∣sant village. <HI>Morpeth,</HI> a small town with a neat town-house, and a tower for the bell near it. The castle was on a small eminence, but the remains are now very inconsiderable. Some attempt was made a few years ago to introduce the <HI>Manchester</HI> manu∣facture, but without success. There is a remarkable story of this place, that the inhabitants reduced their own town to ashes, on the approach of King <HI>John,</HI> A. D. 1215, out of pure hatred to their mo∣narch, in order that he might not find any shelter there.</P>
<P>This place gave birth to <HI>William Turner,</HI> as Dr. <HI>Fuller</HI> expresses it, an excellent <HI>Latinist, Graecian, Oratour,</HI> and <HI>Poet;</HI> he might have added polemic divine, champion and sufferer in the protestant cause, physician and naturalist. His botanic wri∣tings are among the first we had, and certainly the best of them; and his criticisms on the birds of <HI>Aristotle</HI> and <HI>Pliny,</HI> are very judicious. He was the first who flung any light on those subjects in our
<PB N="31" REF="38"/>
island; therefore clames from a naturalist this tri∣bute to his memory <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He was born in the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. died in 1568.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><HI>Felton,</HI> a pleasant village on the <HI>Coquet,</HI> which, some few miles lower, discharges itself into the sea, opposite to a small isle of the same name, remarkable for the multitudes of water-fowl which resort there to breed.</P>
<P>At <HI>Alnwick,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Alnwick</HI> Castle.</NOTE></HI> a small town, the traveller is disap∣pointed with the situation and environs of the castle, the residence of the <HI>Percies,</HI> the antient Earls of <HI>Northumberland.</HI> You look in vain for any marks of the grandeur of the feudal age; for trophies won by a family eminent in our annals for military prowess and deeds of chivalry; for halls hung with helms and haberks, or with the spoils of the chace; for extensive forests, and venerable oaks. You look in vain for the <HI>helmet</HI> on the tower, the antient signal of hospitality to the traveller, or for the grey-headed porter to conduct him to the hall of entertainment. The numerous train, whose coun∣tenances gave welcome to him on his way, are now no more; and instead of the disinterested usher of the old times, he is attended by a <HI>valet</HI> eager to receive the fees of admittance.</P>
<P>There is vast grandeur in the appearance of the outside of the castle; the towers magnificent, but injured by the numbers of rude statues crouded on the battlements. The appartments are large, and lately finished in the gothic style with a most incom∣patible elegance. The gardens are equally incon∣sistent, trim to the highest degree, and more adapted
<PB N="32" REF="39"/>
to a <HI>villa</HI> near <HI>London,</HI> than the antient seat of a great Baron. In a word, nothing, except the num∣bers of unindustrious poor that swarm at the gate, excites any one idea of its former circumstances.</P>
<P>A stage further is <HI>Belford,</HI> the seat of <HI>Abraham Dixon,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> a modern house; the front has a most beautifull simplicity in it. The grounds improved as far as the art of husbandry can reach; the plan∣tations large and flourishing: a new and neat town, instead of the former wretched cottages; and an industrious race, instead of an idle poor, at present fill the estate.</P>
<P>On an eminence on the sea coast,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Bamborough</HI> Castle.</NOTE> about four miles from <HI>Belford,</HI> is the very antient castle of <HI>Bamborough,</HI> built by <HI>Ida,</HI> first king of the <HI>Nor∣thumbrians,</HI> A. D. 548. But, according to the con∣jecture of an antiquarian I met with there, on the site of a <HI>Roman</HI> fortress. It was also his opinion, that the square tower was actually the work of the <HI>Romans.</HI> It had been of great strength; the hill it is founded on excessively steep on all sides, and ac∣cessible only by flights of steps on the south east. The ruins are still considerable; the remains of a great hall are very singular; it had been warmed by two fire-places of a vast size, and from the top of every window ran a flue, like that of a chimney, which reached the summits of the battlements. Many of the ruins are now filled with sand, caught up by the winds that rage here with great impe∣tuosity, and carried to very distant places.</P>
<P>This castle, and the manour belonging to it, was once the property of the <HI>Forsters;</HI> but purchased
<PB N="33" REF="40"/>
by Lord <HI>Crew,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Durham,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bishop <HI>Crew</HI>'s Charity.</NOTE> and with other considerable estates, left vested in Trustees, to be applied to unconfined charitable uses. Three of these Trustees are a majority: one of them makes this place his residence, and blesses the coast by his judicious and humane application of the Prelate's generous bequest. He has repaired and rendered habitable the great square tower: the part reserved for himself and family is a large hall and a few smaller apartments; but the rest of the spacious edifice is allotted for purposes which make the heart to glow with joy when thought of. The upper part is an ample grainary; from whence corn is dispenced to the poor without distinction, even in the dearest time, at the rate of four shillings a bushel; and the distressed, for many miles round, often experience the conveniency of this benefaction.</P>
<P>Other apartments are fitted up for the reception of shipwrecked sailors; and bedding is provided for about thirty, should such a number happen to be cast on shore at the same time. A constant pa∣trole is kept every stormy night along this tem∣pestuous coast, for above eight miles, the length of the manour, by which means numbers of lives have been preserved. Many poor wretches are often found on the shore in a state of insensibility; but by timely relief, are soon brought to themselves.</P>
<P>It often happens, that ships strike in such a man∣ner on the rocks as to be capable of relief, in case numbers of people could be suddenly assembled: for that purpose a cannon <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Once belonging to a <HI>Dutch</HI> frigate of 40 guns; which, with all the crew, was lost opposite to the castle, about sixty years ago.</NOTE> is fixed on the top of
<PB N="34" REF="41"/>
the tower, which is fired once, if the accident hap∣pens in such a quarter; twice, if in another, and thrice, if in such a place. By these signals the country people are directed to the spot they are to fly to; and by this means, frequently preserve not only the crew, but even the vessel; for machines of different kinds are always in readiness to heave ships out of their perillous situation.</P>
<P>In a word, all the schemes of this worthy Trustee have a humane and useful tendency: he seemed as if selected from his brethren for the same purposes as <HI>Spenser</HI> tells us the first of his seven <HI>Beadsmen</HI> in the house of <HI>holinesse</HI> was.</P>
<Q><L>The first of them, that eldest was and best,</L>
<L>Of all the house had charge and governement,</L>
<L>As guardian and steward of the rest:</L>
<L>His office was to give entertainement</L>
<L>And lodging unto all that came and went:</L>
<L>Not unto such as could him feast againe,</L>
<L>And doubly quite for that he on them spent;</L>
<L>But such as want of harbour did constraine;</L>
<L>Those, for GOD's sake, his dewty was to entertaine.</L></Q>
<P>Opposite to <HI>Bamborough</HI> lie the <HI>Farn</HI> islands,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Farn</HI> Isles.</NOTE> which form two groupes of little isles and rocks to the number of seventeen, but at low water the points of others appear above the surface;, they all are distinguished by particular names. The nearest isle to the shore is that called the <HI>House Island,</HI> which lies exactly one mile 68 chains from the coast: the most distant is about seven or eight miles. They are rented for 16l. <HI>per annum:</HI> their produce is kelp, some few feathers, and a few seals, which the tenant watches and shoots for the sake of the oil and skins. Some of them yeild a

little grass, and serve to feed a cow or two, which the people are desperate enough to transport over in their little boats.</P>
<P>Visited these islands in a coble, a safe but seem∣ingly hazardous species of boat,<NOTE PLACE="marg">JULY 15.</NOTE> long, narrow and flat-bottomed, which is capable of going thro' a high sea, dancing like a cork on the summits of the waves.</P>
<P>Touched at the rock called the <HI>Meg,</HI> whitened with the dung of corvorants which almost covered it; their nests were large, made of tang, and most excessively faetid.</P>
<P>Rowed next to the <HI>Pinnacles,</HI> an island in the farthest groupe; so called from some vast columnar rocks at the south end, even at their sides, and flat at their tops, and entirely covered with guillemots and shags: the fowlers pass from one to the other of these columns by means of a narrow board, which they place from top to top, forming a nar∣row bridge, over such a horrid gap, that the very fight of it strikes one with horror.</P>
<P>Landed at a small island, where we found the female <HI>Eider</HI> ducks <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide <HI>Br. Zool.</HI> II. 454. I have been informed that they also breed on <HI>Inch-Colm,</HI> in the <HI>Firth</HI> of <HI>Forth.</HI></NOTE> at that time sitting:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eider Ducks.</NOTE> the lower part of their nests was made of sea plants; the upper part was formed of the down which they pull off their own breasts, in which the eggs were surrounded and warmly bedded: in some were three, in others five eggs, of a large size and pale olive color, as smooth and glossy as if varnished over. The nests are built on the beach, among the loose pebbles, not far from the water. The
<PB N="36" REF="44"/>
Ducks sit very close, nor will they rise till you al∣most tread on them. The Drakes separate them∣selves from the females during the breeding season. We robbed a few of their nests of the down, and after carefully separating it from the tang, found that the down of one nest weighed only three quar∣ters of an ounce, but was so elastic as to fill the crown of the largest hat. The people of this country call these St. <HI>Cuthbert</HI>'s ducks, from the saint of the islands.</P>
<P>Besides these birds, I observed the following:</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>Puffins, called here <HI>Tom Noddies,</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>Auks, here <HI>Skouts,</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>Guillemots,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Black Guillemot,</ITEM>

<ITEM>Common Gull, here <HI>Annets,</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>Kittiwakes, or Tarrocks,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Pewit Gulls,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Great Terns,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Sea Pies,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Sea Larks, here <HI>Brokets,</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>Jackdaws, which breed in rabbet-holes,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Rock Pigeons,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Rock Larks.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P><PB N="37" REF="45"/>
The Terns were so numerous, that in some places it was difficult to tread without crushing some of the eggs.</P>
<P>The last isle I visited was the <HI>House island,</HI> the sequestered spot where St. <HI>Cuthbert</HI> passed the two last years of his life. Here was afterwards esta∣blished a priory of <HI>Benedictines</HI> for six or eight Monks subordinate to <HI>Durham.</HI> A square tower, the remains of a church, and some other buildings, are to be seen there still; and a stone coffin, which, it is pretended, was that of St. <HI>Cuthbert.</HI> At the north end of the isle is a deep chasm, from the top to the bottom of the rock, communicating to the sea; through which, in tempestuous weather, the water is forced with vast violence and noise, and forms a fine <HI>jet d'eau</HI> of sixty-six feet high: it is called by the inhabitants of the opposite coast the <HI>Churn.</HI></P>
<P>Reached shore through a most turbulent rippling, occasioned by the fierce current of the tides between the islands and the coast.</P>
<P>Pursued my journey northward. Saw at a dis∣tance the <HI>Cheviot</HI> hills;<NOTE PLACE="marg">JULY 17.</NOTE> on which, I was informed, the green Plovers breed; and that, during winter, flocks innumerable of the great Bramblings, or Snow-flakes, appear; the most southern place of their migration, in large companies.</P>
<P>The country almost woodless, there being but one wood of any consequence between <HI>Belford</HI> and <HI>Berwick.</HI> Saw on the left an antient tower, which shewed the character of the times when it was un∣happily necessary, on these borders, for every house to be a fortress.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="46"/>
On the right, had a view of the sea, and, not re∣mote from the land, of <HI>Lindesfarn,</HI> or <HI>Holy</HI> Island, once an episcopal seat, afterwards translated to <HI>Durham.</HI> On it are the ruins of a castle and a church. In some parts are abundance of <HI>Entrochi,</HI> which are called by the country people St. <HI>Cuth∣bert</HI>'s beads.</P>
<P>After a few miles riding, have a full view of <HI>Berwick,</HI> and the river <HI>Tweed</HI> winding westward for a considerable way up the country; but its banks were without any particular charms <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I was informed that the beautifull banks of the <HI>Tweed</HI> verify the old fong at the passage at <HI>Colstream.</HI></NOTE>, being almost woodless. The river is broad; and has over it a bridge of sixteen very handsome arches, eipe∣cially two next the town.</P>
<P>BERWICK is fortified in the modern way; but is much contracted in its extent to what it was for∣merly, the old castle and works now lying at some distance beyond the present ramparts. The bar∣racks are large, consist of a center and two wings. The church was built by <HI>Cromwel,</HI> and, according to the spirit of the builder, without a steeple. Even in <HI>Northumberland,</HI> (towards the borders) the stee∣ples grew less and less, and as if it were forewarned the traveller that he was speedily to take leave of episcopacy. The town-house has a large and hand∣some modern tower to it: the streets in general are narrow and bad, except that in which the town∣house stands.</P>
<P>Abundance of wool is exported from this town: eggs in vast abundance collected through all the
<PB N="39" REF="47"/>
country, almost as far as <HI>Carlisle:</HI> they are packed in boxes, with the thick end downwards, and are sent to <HI>London</HI> for the use of sugar refiners. I was told that as many are exported as bring in annually the sum of fourteen thousand pounds.</P>
<P>The salmon fisheries here are very considerable,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Salmon fishery.</NOTE> and likewise bring in vast sums: they lie on each side the river; and are all private property, except what belongs to the Dean and Chapter of <HI>Durham,</HI> which, in rent and tythe of fish, brings in 450l. <HI>per ann.</HI> for all the other fisheries are liable to tythe. The common rents of those are 50l. a year, for which the tenants have as much shore as serves to launch out and draw their nets on shore: the limits of each are staked; and I observed that the fishers never failed going as near as possible to their neigh∣bor's limits. One man goes off in a small flat∣bottomed boat, square at one end, and taking as large a circuit as his net admits, brings it on shore at the extremity of his boundary, where others assist in landing it. The best fishery is on the south side <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">For a fuller account of this fishery, vide <HI>British Zoology,</HI> III. 24l. to it may be also added, that in the middle of the river, not a mile west of the town, is a large stone, on which a man is placed, to observe what is called the <HI>reck</HI> of the salmon coming up.</NOTE>: very fine salmon trout are often taken here, which come up to spawn from the sea, and return in the same manner as the salmon do. The chief import is timber from <HI>Norway</HI> and the <HI>Baltic.</HI></P>
<P>Almost immediately on leaving <HI>Berwick,</HI> enter
<PB N="40" REF="48"/>
in the shire of <HI>Merch,</HI> or <HI>Mers</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Boethius</HI> says, that in his time bustards were found in this county; but they are now extirpated: the historian calls them <HI>Gustardes.

A little way from <HI>Berwick,</HI> on the west, is <HI>Halydon</HI> hill, famous for the overthrow of the <HI>Scots</HI> under the regent <HI>Douglas,</HI> by <HI>Edward</HI> III. on the attempt of the former to raise the siege of that town. A cruel action blasted the laurels of the conqueror: <HI>Seton,</HI> the governor, stipulated to surrender in fifteen days, if not relieved in that time, and gave his son as hostage for per∣formance. The time elapsed; <HI>Seton</HI> refused to execute the agreement, and with a <HI>Roman</HI> unfeel∣ingness beheld the unhappy youth hung before the walls.</P>
<P>The entrance into <HI>Scotland</HI> has a very unpro∣mising look; for it wanted, for some miles, the cultivation of the parts more distant from <HI>England:</HI> but the borders were necessarily neglected; for, till the accession of <HI>James</HI> VI. and even long after, the national enmity was kept up, and the borderers of both countries discouraged from improvement, by the barbarous inroads of each nation. This inat∣tention to agriculture continued till lately; but on reaching the small village of <HI>Eytown,</HI> the scene was greatly altered; the wretched cottages, or rather hovels of the country, were vanishing; good com∣fortable houses arise in their stead; the lands are inclosing, and yield very good barley, oats, and clover; the banks are planting: I speak in the present tense; for there is still a mixture of the
<PB N="41" REF="49"/>
old negligence left amidst the recent improvements, which look like the works of a new colony in a wretched impoverished country.</P>
<P>Soon after the country relapses; no arable land is seen; but for four or five miles succeeds the black joyless heathy moor of <HI>Coldingham:</HI> hap∣pily,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Coldingham.</HI></NOTE> this is the whole specimen that remains of the many miles, which, not many years ago, were in the same dreary unprofitable state. Near this was the convent of that name immortalized by the he∣roism of its Nuns; who, to preserve themselves in∣violate from the <HI>Danes,</HI> cut off their lips and noses; and thus rendering themselves objects of horror, were, with their abbess <HI>Ebba</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A. D. 870.</NOTE>, burnt in the mo∣nastery by the disappointed savages.</P>
<P>At the end of the moor came at once in sight of the <HI>Firth</HI> <NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot"><HI>Bodotria</HI> of <HI>Tacitus,</HI> who describes the two Firths of <HI>Clyde</HI> and <HI>Forth,</HI> and the intervening Isthmus, with much propriety, speaking of the fourth summer <HI>Agricola</HI> had passed in <HI>Britain,</HI> and how con∣convenient he found this narrow tract for shutting out the enemy by his fortresses, says, <HI>Nam</HI> Glota (Firth of <HI>Clyde</HI>) <HI>et</HI> Bodotria, <HI>diversi maris astu per immensum revecti, anguslo terrarum spatio diri∣muntur:</HI> Vit.

<P>After going down a long descent dine at <HI>Old Cambus,</HI> at a mean house, in a poor village; where I believe the Lord of the soil is often execrated by the weary traveller, for not enabling the tenant to furnish more comfortable accommodations, in so considerable a thoroughfare.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="50"/>
The country becomes now extremely fine; bounded at a distance, on one side, by hills; on the other, by the sea: the intervening space is as rich a tract of corn land as I ever saw; for <HI>East Lothian</HI> is the <HI>Northamptonshire</HI> of <HI>North Britain:</HI> the land is in many places manured with sea tang; but I was informed, that the barley produced from, it is much lighter than barley from other manure.</P>
<P>On the side of the hills on the left is Sir <HI>John Hall</HI>'s, of <HI>Dunglas;</HI> a fine situation, with beautifull plantations. Pass by <HI>Broxmouth,</HI> a large house of the <HI>Duke</HI> of <HI>Roxborough,</HI> in a low spot, with great woods surrounding it. Reach</P>
<P>DUNBAR:<NOTE PLACE="marg">DUNBAR.</NOTE> the chief street broad and handsome; the houses built of stone; as is the case with most of the towns in <HI>Scotland.</HI> There are some ships sent annually from this place to <HI>Greenland,</HI> and the ex∣ports of corn are pretty considerable. The harbour is safe, but small; its entrance narrow, and bounded by two rocks. Between the harbour and the castle is a very surprising stratum of stone,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Columnar rocks.</NOTE> in some respects resembling that of <HI>Giant's Causeway</HI> in <HI>Ireland:</HI> it consists of great columns of a red grit stone, either triangular, quadrangular, pentangular, or hexangular; their diameter from one to two feet, their length at low water thirty, dipping or inclining a little to the south.</P>
<P>They are jointed, but not so regularly, or so plainly, as those that form the <HI>Giant's Causeway.</HI> The surface of several that had been torn off appear as a pavement of numbers of convex ends, probably answering to the concave bottoms of other joints once incumbent on them. The space between the
<PB N="43" REF="51"/>
columns was filled with thin septa of red and white fparry matter; and veins of the same pervaded the columns transversely. This range of columns faces the north, with a point to the east, and extends in front about two hundred yards. The breadth is inconsiderable: the rest of the rock degenerates into shapeless masses of the same fort of stone, irregu∣larly divided by thick septa. This rock is called by the people of <HI>Dunbar,</HI> the <HI>Isle.</HI></P>
<P>Opposite are the ruins of the castle, seated on a rock above the sea; underneath one part is a vast cavern, composed of a black and red stone, which gives it a most infernal appearance; a fit represen∣tation of the pit of <HI>Acheron,</HI> and wanted only to be peopled with witches to make the scene complete: it appears to have been the dungeon, there being a formed passage from above, where the poor pri∣soners might have been let down, according to the barbarous custom of war in early days. There are in some parts, where the rock did not close, the remains of walls; for the openings are only natural fissures; but the founders of the castle taking ad∣vantage of this cavity, adding a little art to it, ren∣dered it a most complete and secure prison.</P>
<P>On the other side are two natural arches, through which the tide flowed; under one was a fragment of wall, where there seems to have been a portal for the admission of men or provisions from sea: thro' which, it is probable that <HI>Alexander Ramsay,</HI> in a stormy night, reinforced the garrison, in spite of the fleet which lay before the place, when closely besieged by the <HI>English,</HI> in 1337, and galantly de∣fended

<P>A little further, about a mile from the shore,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Bass</HI> Isle.</NOTE> lies the <HI>Bass</HI> Island, or rather rock, of a most stu∣pendous height, on the south side the top appears of a conic shape, but the other over-hangs the sea in a most tremendous manner. The castle, which was once the state prison of <HI>Scotland,</HI> is now neg∣lected: it lies close to the edge of the precipice, facing the little village of <HI>Castleton;</HI> where I toke boat, in order to visit this singular spot; but the weather proved unfavorable, the wind blew so fresh, and the waves ran so high, that it was im∣possible to attempt landing; for even in calmer weather it cannot be done without hazard, there being a steep rock to ascend, and commonly a great swell, which often removes the boat while you are scaling the precipice; so, in case of a false

Reach</P>
<P>EDINBURGH,<NOTE PLACE="marg">EDINBURGH.</NOTE> A city that possesses a boldness and grandeur of situation beyond any that I had ever seen: it is built on the edges and sides of a vast sloping rock, of a great and precipitous height at the upper ex∣tremity, and the sides declining very quick and steep into the plain. The view of the houses at a distance strikes the traveller with wonder; then own loftiness, improved by their almost aerial situ∣ation, gives them a look of magnificence not to be found in any other part of <HI>Great Britain.</HI> All thefe conspicuous buildings form the upper part of the great street, are of stone, and make a handsome appearance: they are generally six or seven stories high in front; but, by reafon of the declivity of the hill, much higher backward;, one in particular,
<PB N="47" REF="55"/>
called <HI>Babel,</HI> has about twelve or thirteen stories. Every house has a common staircase, and every story is the habitation of a separate family. The inconvenience of this particular structure need not be mentioned; notwithstanding the utmost atten∣tion, in the article of cleanliness, is in general observed. The common complaint of the streets of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> is now taken away, by the great vigi∣lance of the magistrates <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The streets are cleaned early every morning. Once the City payed for the cleaning; at present, it is rented for 4 or 500l. per annum.</NOTE>, and their severity against any that offend in any gross degree <NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">In the closes, or allies, the inhabitants are very apt to fling out their filth, &amp;c. without regarding who passes; but the sufferer may call every-inhabitant of the house it came from to account, and make them prove the delinquent, who is always punished with a heavy fine.</NOTE>. It must be observed, that this unfortunate species of archi∣tecture arose from the turbulence of the times in which it was in vogue; every body was desirous of getting as near as possible to the protection of the castle, the houses were crouded together, and I may say, piled one upon another, meerly on the principle of security.</P>
<P>The castle is antient, but strong,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Castle.</NOTE> placed on the summit of the hill, at the edge of a very deep pre∣cipice. Strangers are shewn a very small room, in which <HI>Mary</HI> Queen of <HI>Scots</HI> was delivered of <HI>James</HI> VI.</P>
<P>From this fortress is a full view of the city and its environs; a strange prospect of rich country, with vast rocks and mountains intermixed: on the south and east are the meadows, or the publick walks, <HI>Harriot</HI>'s hospital, part of the town over∣shadowed

<P>To the north is a full view of the <HI>Firth</HI> of <HI>Forth,</HI> from <HI>Queen's-Ferry</HI> to its mouth, with its southern banks covered with towns and villages. On the whole, the prospect is singular, various and fine.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Reservoir.</NOTE> The reservoir of water <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is conveyed in pipes from the <HI>Pentland</HI> hills five miles distant.</NOTE> for supplying the city lies in the Castle-street, and is well worth seeing: the great cistern contains near two hundred and thirty tuns of water, which is conveyed to the several conduits, that are disposed at proper dis∣tances in the principal streets; these are conve∣niences that few towns in <HI>North Britain</HI> are with∣out.</P>
<P>In a small square, on the south side of <HI>High-street,</HI> is the Parlement Close, a small square, in which is the Parlement-House,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Advocate's Library.</NOTE> where the courts of justice are held. Below stairs is the Advocate's library, founded by Sir <HI>George Mackenzie,</HI> and now contains above thirty thousand volumes, and several manuscripts: among the more curious are the four Evangelists, very legible, notwithstanding it is said to be several hundred years old.</P>
<P>St. <HI>Jerome</HI>'s Bible, wrote about the year 1100.</P>
<P>A <HI>Malabar</HI> book, wrote on leaves of plants.</P>

A Cartulary, or records of the monasteries, some very antient.</P>

<P>The <HI>Luckenbooth</HI> row, which contains the <HI>Tol∣booth,</HI> or city prison, and the weighing-house, which brings in a revenue of 500l. <HI>per annum,</HI> stands in the middle of the High-street, and, with the guard∣house, contributes to spoil as fine a street as most in <HI>Europe,</HI> being in some parts eighty feet wide, and finely built.</P>
<P>The exchange is a handsome modern building, in which is the custom-house: the first is of no use, in its proper character; for the merchants al∣ways chuse standing in the open street, exposed to all kinds of weather.</P>
<P>The old cathedral is now called the New Church, and is divided into four places of worship; in one the Lords of the Sessions attend: there is also a throne and a canopy for his Majesty, should he visit this capital, and another for the Lord Com∣missioner. There is no music either in this or any other of the <HI>Scotch</HI> churches, for <HI>Peg</HI> still faints at the found of an organ.</P>
<P>The same church has a large tower, oddly ter∣minated with a sort of crown.</P>
<P>On the front of a house in the <HI>Nether Bow,</HI> are two fine profile heads of a man and woman,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Roman</HI> heads.</NOTE> of <HI>Roman</HI> sculpture, supposed to be those of <HI>Severus</HI>

<P>At Lord <HI>Dunmore</HI>'s lodgings is a very large piece of <HI>Charles</HI> I. and his Queen going to ride, with the sky showering roses on them; a Black holds a grey horse, a boy a spaniel, with several other dogs sporting round: the Queen is painted with a love∣lock, and with browner hair and complection, and younger, than I ever saw her drawn. It is a good piece, and said to be done by <HI>Vandyck?</HI> in the same place are two other good portraits of <HI>Charles</HI> II. and <HI>James</HI> VII.</P>
<P>The gallery of this palace takes up one side, and is filled with colossal portraits of the Kings of <HI>Scot∣land.</HI></P>
<P>In the old towers are showen the appartments where the murther of <HI>David Rizzo</HI> was committed.</P>
<P>That beautifull piece of <HI>gothic</HI> architecture the church,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chapel.</NOTE> or chapel, of <HI>Holy-Rood-Abby,</HI> is now a ruin, the roof having fell in, by a most scandalous neglect, notwithstanding money had been granted by Government to preserve it entire. Beneath the ruins lie the bodies of <HI>James</HI> II. and <HI>James</HI> V. <HI>Henry Darnly,</HI> and several persons of rank: and the inscriptions on several of their tombs are preserved by <HI>Maitland.</HI> A gentleman informed me, that some years ago he had seen the remains of the bodies, but in a very decayed state; the beards remained on some; and that the bones of <HI>Henry Darnly</HI> proved their owner, by their great size, for he was said to be seven feet high.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="60"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Parks.</NOTE> Near this palace are the <HI>Parks</HI> first inclosed by <HI>James</HI> V. within are the vast rocks <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">According to <HI>Maitland,</HI> their perpendicular height is 656 feet.</NOTE> known by the names of <HI>Arthur</HI>'s Seat and <HI>Salusbury's Craigs;</HI> their fronts exhibit a romantic and wild scene of broken rocks and vast precipices, which from some points seem to over-hang the lower parts of the city. Great columns of stone, from forty to fifty feet in length, and about two feet in diameter, regularly pentagonal, or hexagonal, hang down the face of some of these rocks almost perpendicularly, or with a very slight dip, and form a strange appearance. Considerable quantities of stone from the quarries have been cut and sent to <HI>London</HI> for paving the streets, its great hardness rendering it excellent for that purpose. Beneath these hills are some of the most beautifull walks about <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> command∣ing a fine prospect over several parts of the country.</P>
<P>On one side of the <HI>Park</HI> are the ruins of St. <HI>An∣thony</HI>'s chapel, once the resort of numberless vo∣taries.</P>
<P>The south part of the city has several things worth visiting.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Herriot</HI>'s Hos∣pital.</NOTE> <HI>Herriot</HI>'s hospital is a fine old building, much too magnificent for the end pro∣posed, that of educating poor children: it was founded by <HI>George Herriot,</HI> jeweller to <HI>James</HI> II. who followed that monarch to <HI>London,</HI> and made a large fortune. There is a fine view of the castle and the sloping part of the city from the front: the gardens were formerly the resort of the gay; and there the <HI>Scotch</HI> Poets often laid, in their co∣medies, the scenes of intrigue.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="61"/>
In the church-yard of the Grey Friers is the mo∣nument of Sir <HI>George Mackensie,</HI> a rotunda; with a multitude of other tombs; this, and another near the <HI>Cannon-gate</HI> being the only caemeteries to this populous city.</P>
<P>The college is a mean building; but no one re∣sides in it except the Principal,<NOTE PLACE="marg">College.</NOTE> whose house is sup∣posed to be on the site of that in which <HI>George Darnly</HI> was murdered, then belonging to the Provost of the <HI>Kirk</HI> of <HI>Field.</HI> The students of the university are dispersed over the town, and are about six hundred in number: they wear no habit, nor are they subject to any regulations; but, as they are for the most part volunteers for knowledge, few of them desert her standards. There are twenty-two professors of different sciences, most of whom read lectures: all the chairs are very ably filled; those in particular which relate to the study of medicine, as is evident from the number of ingenious physicians, <HI>eleves</HI> of this university, who prove the abilities of their mas∣ters. The <HI>Musaeum</HI> had, for many years, been neglected; but, by the assiduity of the present Pro∣fessor of natural history, bids fair to become a most instructive repository of the <HI>naturalia</HI> of these king∣doms.</P>
<P>The royal infirmary is a spatious and handsome aedifice,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Infirmary.</NOTE> capable of containing two hundred patients. The operation-room is particularly convenient, the council-room elegant, with a good picture in it of Provost <HI>Drummond.</HI> From the cupolo of this building is a fine prospect, and a full view of the city.</P>

Not far from hence are twenty-seven acres of ground, designed for a square, called <HI>George Square:</HI> a small portion is at present built, consisting of small but commodious houses, in the <HI>English</HI> fashion. Such is the spirit of emprovement, that within these three years sixty thousand pounds have been expended in houses in the modern taste, and twenty thousand in the old.</P>
<P><HI>Watson</HI>'s hospital should not be forgot: a large good building, behind the Grey Friers church; an excellent institution for the educating and appren∣ticing the children of decayed merchants; who, after having served their time with credit, receive fifty pounds to set up with.</P>
<P>The <HI>meadows,</HI> or public walks, are well planted, and are very extensive: these are the mall of <HI>Edin∣burgh,</HI> as <HI>Comely Gardens</HI> are its <HI>Vauxhall.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Cowgate</HI> is a long street, running parallel with the <HI>High Street,</HI> beneath the steep southern declivity of the city, and terminates in the <HI>Grass-Market,</HI> a wide street, where cattle are sold, and criminals executed. On several of the houses are small iron crosses, which, I was informed, denoted that they once belonged to the Knights of St. <HI>John.</HI></P>
<P>On the north side of the city lies the new town, which is planned with great judgement, and will prove a magnificent addition to <HI>Edinburgh:</HI> the houses in St. <HI>Andrew</HI>'s square cost from 1800l. to 2000l. each, and one or two 4000 or 5000l. They are all built in the modern style, and are free from the inconveniences attending the old city.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="63"/>
These improvements are connected to the city by a very beautifull bridge, whose highest arch is ninety-five feet high.</P>
<P>In the walk of this evening, I passed by a deep and wide hollow beneath <HI>Calton</HI> Hill, the place where those imaginary criminals, witches and for∣cerers, in less enlightened times, were burnt; and where, at festive seasons, the gay and galant held their tilts and tournaments: at one of these, it is said, that the Earl of <HI>Bothwell</HI> made the first im∣pression on the susceptible heart of <HI>Mary Stuart,</HI> having galopped into the ring down the dangerous steeps of the adjacent hill; he seemed to think that</P>

<P>These desperate feats were the humour of the times of chivalry: <HI>Brantome</HI> relates, that the <HI>Duc∣de Nemours</HI> galopped down the steps of the <HI>Sainte Chappel</HI> at <HI>Paris,</HI> to the astonishment of the be∣holders. The men cultivated every exercise that could preserve or improve their bodily strength; the ladies, every art that tended to improve their charms: <HI>Mary</HI> is reported to have used a bath of white wine; a custom strange, but not without precedent. <HI>Jaques du Fouilloux,</HI> enraptured with a country girl enumerating the arts which she scorned to use to improve her person, mentions this:</P>

It is finely stocked with plants, whose arrangement and cultivation do much credit to my worthy friend Dr. <HI>Hope,</HI> Professor of Botany, who planned and executed the whole.

Many fine excursions may be made at a small distance from this city. <HI>Leith,</HI> a large town,<NOTE PLACE="marg">LEITH.</NOTE> about two miles north, lies on the <HI>Firth,</HI> is a flourishing place, and the port of <HI>Edinburgh.</HI> The town is dirty and ill built, and chiefly inhabited by sailors; but the pier is very fine, and is a much-frequented walk. The races were at this time on the sands, near low-water mark: considering their vicinity to a great city and populous country, the meeting was far from numerous; a proof that dissipation has not generally infected the manners of the <HI>North Britons.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Craigmellar</HI> castle is seated on a rocky eminence, about two miles south of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> is square, and has towers at each corner. Some few apartments are yet inhabited; but the rest of this great pile is in ruins.</P>
<P><HI>Newbottle,</HI> the seat of the Marquiss of <HI>Lothian,</HI> is a pleasant ride of a few miles from the capital. It was once a <HI>Cistercian</HI> abby, founded by <HI>David</HI> I. in 1140; but, in 1591, was erected into a lordship, in favor of Sir <HI>Mark Ker,</HI> son of Sir <HI>Walter Ker,</HI> of <HI>Cessford.</HI> The house lies in a warm bottom, and, like most other of the houses of the <HI>Scotch</HI> nobility, resembles a <HI>French Chateau,</HI> by having a village or little paltry town adjacent. The situation is very favorable to trees, as appears by the vast size of those near the house; and I was informed, that fruit ripens here within ten days as early as at <HI>Chelsea.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Marquiss</HI> possesses a most valuable collection of portraits, many of them very fine, and almost all very instructive: a large half-length of <HI>Henry Darnly</HI> represents him tall, aukward and gauky, with a stupid, insipid countenance; most likely

<HI>South-Ferry,</HI> a small village on the banks of the <HI>Firth,</HI> which suddenly is contracted to the breadth of two miles by the jutting out of the land on both shores; but almost instantly widens, towards the west, into a fine and extensive bay. The prospect on each side is very beautifull; a rich country, frequently diversified with towns, villages, castles, and gentlemen's seats <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Such as <HI>Seith</HI> castle, <HI>Dumferline</HI> town, Lord <HI>Morris</HI>'s, Lord <HI>Hopetoun</HI>'s, Captain <HI>Dundass</HI>'s.</NOTE>.

filled with friable micaceous nodules. The granite itself is very hard, and is all blasted with gun∣powder: the cutting into shape for paving costs two shillings and eight-pence per tun, and the freight to <HI>London</HI> seven shillings.</P>
<P>The country, as far as <HI>Kinross,</HI> is very fine, con∣sisting of gentle risings; much corn, especially <HI>Bear;</HI> but few trees, except about a gentleman's seat, called <HI>Blair,</HI> where there are great and flou∣rishing plantations. Near the road are the last col∣lieries in <HI>Scotland,</HI> except the inconsiderable works in the county of <HI>Sutherland.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Kinross</HI> is a small town, seated in a large plain, bounded by mountains; the houses and trees are so intermixed as to give it an agreeable appearance. It has some manufactures of linnen and cutlery ware. At this time was a meeting of justices, on a singular occasion: a vagrant had been, not long before, ordered to be whipped; but such was the point of honor among the common people, that no one could be persuaded to go to <HI>Perth</HI> for the executioner, who lived there: to press, I may say, two men for that service was the cause of the meeting; so Mr. <HI>Bos∣well</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Hist. Corsica.</HI></NOTE> may rejoice to find the notion of honor pre∣vale in as exalted a degree among his own coun∣trymen as among the virtuous <HI>Corsicans.</HI></P>
<P>Not far from the town is the house of <HI>Kinross,</HI> built by the famous architect Sir <HI>William Bruce,</HI> for his own residence, and was the first good house in <HI>North Britain:</HI> it is a large, elegant, but plain building; the hall is fifty-two feet long, the grounds about it well planted, the fine lake adjacent; so
<PB N="64" REF="72"/>
that it is capable of being made as delightfull a place as any in <HI>North Britain.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Lough-Leven,</HI> a magnificent piece of water, very broad, but irregularly indented, is about twelve miles in circumference, and its greatest depth about twenty-four fathoms: is finely bounded by moun∣tains on one side; on the other, by the plain of <HI>Kinross,</HI> and prettily embellished with several groves, most fortunately disposed. Some islands are dis∣persed in this great expanse of water; one of which is large enough to feed several head of cattle; but the most remarkable is that distinguished by the captivity of <HI>Mary Stuart,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Loch-leven</HI> castle.</NOTE> which stands almost in the middle of the lake. The castle still remains; consists of a square tower, a small yard with two round towers, a chapel, and the ruins of a building, where, it is said, the unfortunate Princess was lodged. In the square tower is a dungeon with a vaulted room above, over which had been three other sto∣ries. Some trees are yet remaining on this little spot; probably coeval with <HI>Mary,</HI> under whose shade she may have sat, expecting her escape at length effected by the enamoured <HI>Douglas</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Historians differ in respect to the cause that influenced him to assist in his sovereign's escape; some attribute it to his avarice, and think he was bribed with jewels, reserved by <HI>Mary;</HI> others, that he was touched by a more generous passion: the last opinion is the most natural considering the charms of the Queen and the youth of her deliverer.</NOTE>. This castle had before been a royal residence, but not for captive monarchs; having been granted from the crown by <HI>Robert</HI> III. to <HI>Douglas,</HI> Laird of <HI>Loch-Leven;</HI> but had been originally a seat of the <HI>Culdees.</HI></P>

The fish of this lake are Pike, small Perch, fine Eels,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fish &amp; birds.</NOTE> and most excellent Trouts; the best and the reddest I ever saw; the largest about six pounds in weight. The fishermen gave me an account of a species they called the <HI>Gally</HI> Trout, which are only caught from <HI>October</HI> to <HI>January;</HI> are split, salted and dried, for winter provision: by the description, they certainly were our Char, only of a larger size than any we have in <HI>England,</HI> or <HI>Wales,</HI> some being two feet and a half long. The birds that breed on the isles are Herring Gulls, Pewit Gulls, and great Terns, called here <HI>Pictarnes.</HI></P>
<P>Lay at a good inn, a single house, about half a mile North of <HI>Kinross.</HI></P>
<P>Made an excursion about seven miles west,<NOTE PLACE="marg">JULY 25. Rumbling Brig.</NOTE> to see the <HI>rumbling brig</HI> at <HI>Glen-devon,</HI> a bridge of one arch, slung over a chasm worn by the river <HI>Devon,</HI> about eighty feet deep, very narrow, and horrible to look down; the bottom, in many parts, is covered with fragments of rocks; in others, the waters are visible, gushing between the stones with great vio∣lence: the sides, in many places, project, and al∣most lock in each other; trees shoot out in various spots, and contribute to encrease the gloom of the glen, while the ear is filled with the cawing of daws, the cooing of wood-pigeons, and the impetuous noise of the waters.</P>
<P>A mile lower down is the <HI>Cawdron Glen:</HI> here the river,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cawdron Glen.</HI></NOTE> after a short fall, drops on rocks hollowed in a strange manner into large and deep cylindric cavities, open on one side, or formed into great circular cavities, like cauldrons <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In <HI>Sweden,</HI> and the North of <HI>Germany,</HI> such holes as these are called <HI>Giant</HI>'s Pots. <HI>Kalm's Voy.</HI> I. 121. and <HI>Ph.

<PB N="66" REF="74"/>
the name of the place: one in particular has the appearance of a vast brewing vessel; and the water, by its great agitation, has acquired a yellow scum, exactly resembling the yesty working of malt liquor. Just beneath this the water darts down about thirty feet in form of a great white sheet: the rocks below widen considerably, and their clifty sides are fringed with wood. Beyond is a view of a fine meadowy vale, and the distant mountains near <HI>Sterling.</HI></P>
<P>Two miles north is <HI>Castle Campbell,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Castle <HI>Campbell.</HI></NOTE> seated on a steep peninsulated rock between vast mountains, having to the south a boundless view through a deep glen shagged with brush wood; for the forests that once covered the country are now entirely de∣stroyed. Formerly, from its darksome situation, this pile was called the castle of <HI>Gloom;</HI> and all the names of the adjacent places were suitable: it was seated in the parish of <HI>Dolor,</HI> was bounded by the glens of care, and washed by the birns of <HI>sorrow.</HI> This castle, with the whole territory, belonging to the family of <HI>Argyle,</HI> underwent all the calamities of civil war in 1645; for its rival, the Marquis of <HI>Montrose,</HI> carried fire and sword through the whole estate. The castle was ruined; and its magnificent reliques exist, as a monument of the horror of the times. No wonder then that the <HI>Marquis</HI> expe∣rienced so woeful and ignominious a fate, when he fell into the power of so exasperated a chieftain.</P>
<P>Returned to my inn along the foot of the <HI>Ochil</HI> hills, whose sides were covered with a fine verdure, and fed great numbers of cattle and sheep. The country below full of oats, and in a very improving state: the houses of the common people decent, but <PB N="67" REF="75"/>
mostly covered with sods; some were covered both with straw and sod. The inhabitants extremely civil, and never failed offering brandy, or whey, when I stopt to make enquiries at any of their houses.</P>
<P>In the afternoon crossed a branch of the same hills, which yielded plenty of oats; descended into <HI>Straith-earn,</HI> a beautifull vale, about thirty miles in length,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Straith-earn.</HI></NOTE> full of rich meadows and corn fields, divided by the river <HI>Earn,</HI> which serpentines finely through the middle, falling into the <HI>Tay,</HI> of which there is a fight at the east end of the vale. It is prettily diversified with groves of trees and gentlemen's houses; among which, towards the west end, is <HI>Castle Drummond,</HI> the forfeited seat of the Earl of <HI>Perth.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Castle Duplin</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Near this place was the battle of <HI>Duplin,</HI> 1332, between the <HI>English,</HI> under the command of <HI>Baliol,</HI> and the <HI>Scots.</HI> The last were defeated, and such a number of the name of <HI>Hay</HI> slain, that the family would have been extinct, had not several of their wives been left at home pregnant.</NOTE>; the residence of the Earl of <HI>Kinnouly</HI> seated on the north side of the vale, on the edge of a steep glen. Only a single tower re∣mains of the old castle, the rest being modernized. The front commands a pleasing view of the vale; behind are plantations, extending several miles in length; all flourish greatly, except those of ash. I remarked in the woods, some very large chesnuts, horse-chesnuts, spruce and silver firs, cedar and arbor vitae. Broad-leaved <HI>laburnum</HI> thrives in this country greatly, grows to a great size, and the wood is used in sineering.</P>
<P>Fruits succeed here very indifferently;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fruit</NOTE> even non∣pareils require a wall to ripen: grapes, figs, and late

peaches, will not ripen: the winters begin early and end late, and are attended with very high winds. I was informed that labor is dear here,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Labor.</NOTE> notwithstand∣ing it is only eight-pence a day; the common people not being yet got into a method of working, so do very little for their wages. Notwithstanding this, improvements are carried on in these parts with great spirit, both in planting and in agriculture. Lord <HI>Kinnoul</HI> planted last year not sewer than eighty thou∣sand trees, besides <HI>Scotch</HI> firs; so provides future forests for the benefit of his successors, and the em∣bellishment of his country. In respect to agricul∣ture, there are difficulties to struggle with, for the country is without either coal or lime-stone; so that the lime is brought from the estate of the Earl of <HI>Elgin,</HI> near <HI>Dumferline,</HI> who, I was told, drew a considerable revenue from the kilns.</P>

Ascended the hill of <HI>Moncrief;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">JULY 27. Hill of <HI>Mon∣crief.</HI></NOTE> the prospect from thence is the glory of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and well merits the eulogia given it for the variety and richness of its views. On the south and west appear <HI>Straithern,</HI> embellished with the seats of Lord <HI>Kinnoul,</HI> Lord Rollo, and of several other gentlemen, the <HI>Carse,</HI> or rich plain of <HI>Gowrie, Stormont</HI> hills, and the hill of <HI>Kinnoul,</HI> whose vast cliff is remarkable for its beau∣tifull pebbles. The maeanders of the <HI>Ern,</HI> which winds more than any river I at this time had seen, are most enlivening additions to the scene. The last turn it takes forms a fine peninsula prettily planted, and just beyond it joins the <HI>Tay,</HI> whose aestuary lies full in view, the sea closing the prospect on this side.</P>
<P>To the north lies the town of <HI>Perth,</HI> with a view of part of its magnificent bridge; which, with the fine woods called <HI>Perth</HI> Parks, the vast plain of <HI>Straith-Tay,</HI> the winding of that noble river, its islands, and the grand boundary, formed by the distant highlands, finish this matchless scene. The inhabitants of <HI>Perth</HI> are far from being blind to the beauties of their river; for with singular pleasure they relate the tradition of the <HI>Roman</HI> army, when it came in fight of the <HI>Tay</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Taus, <HI>Taciti vit. Agr.</HI></NOTE>, bursting into the ex∣clamation of, <HI>Ecce Tiberim.</HI></P>
<P>On approaching the town are some pretty walks handsomely planted, and at a small distance, the remains of some works of <HI>Cromwel,</HI> called <HI>Oliver</HI>'s Mount.</P>
<P>PERTH is large, and in general well built;<NOTE PLACE="marg">PERTH</NOTE> two of the streets are remarkably fine; in some of the
<PB N="70" REF="78"/>
lesser are yet a few wooden houses in the old style; but as they decay, the magistrates prohibit the re∣building them in the old way. There is but one parish, which has two churches, besides meetings for separatists, who are very numerous. One church, which belonged to a monastery, is very antient: not a vestige of the last is now to be seen; for the disciples of that rough apostle <HI>Knox</HI> made a general desolation of every aedifice that had given shelter to the worshippers of the church of <HI>Rome:</HI> it being one of his maxims, to pull down the nests, and the rooks would fly away.</P>
<P>The flourishing state of <HI>Perth</HI> is owing to two accidents: the first, that of numbers of <HI>Cromwel</HI>'s wounded officers and soldiers chusing to reside here, after he left the kingdom, who introduced a spirit of industry among the people: the other cause was the long continuance of the Earl of <HI>Mar</HI>'s army here in 1715, which occasioned vast sums of money being spent in the place: but this town, as well as all <HI>Scotland,</HI> dates its prosperity from the year 1745, the government of this part of <HI>Great Britain</HI> having never been settled till a little after that time. The rebellion was a disorder violent in its operation, but salutary in its effects.</P>
<P>The trade of <HI>Perth</HI> is considerable:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trade.</NOTE> it exports annually one hundred and fifty thousand pounds worth of linnen, ten thousand of wheat and barley, and about the same in cured salmon. That fish is taken there in vast abundance; three thousand have been caught in one morning, weighing, one with another, sixteen pounds; the whole capture, forty∣eight thousand pounds. The fishery begins at St.
<PB N="71" REF="79"/>
<HI>Andrew</HI>'s Day, and ends <HI>August</HI> 26th, old style. The rents of the fisheries amount to three thousand pounds <HI>per annum.</HI></P>
<P>I was informed that smelts come up this river in <HI>May</HI> and <HI>June.</HI></P>
<P>There has been in these parts a very great fishery of pearl, got out of the fresh-water muscles. From the year 1761 to 1764,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pearl.</NOTE> 10,000l. worth were sent to <HI>London,</HI> and sold from 10s. to 1l. 16s. <HI>per</HI> ounce. I was told that a pearl has been taken there that weighed 33 grains; but this fishery is at present exhausted, from the avarice of the under∣takers: it once extended as far as <HI>Lough-Tay.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Gowrie</HI> House is shewn to all strangers; formerly the property and residence of the Earl of <HI>Gowrie,</HI> whose tragical end and mysterious conspiracy (if con∣spiracy there was) are still fresh in the minds of the people of <HI>Perth.</HI> At present the house is occupied by some companies of artillery. I was shewn the staircase where the unhappy nobleman was killed,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Gowrie</HI> con∣spiracy.</NOTE> the window the frighted monarch <HI>James</HI> roared out of, and that he escaped through, when he was saved from the fury of the populace, by Baily Roy, a friend of <HI>Gowrie</HI>'s, who was extremely beloved in the town.</P>
<P>From the little traditions, preserved in the palace, it seems as if <HI>Gowrie</HI> had not the left intent of mur∣thering the King: on the day his Majesty came to <HI>Perth,</HI> the Earl was engaged to a wedding-dinner with the Dean of Guild: when the account of the king's design reached him he changed color, on being taken so unprovided; but the Dean forced him to accept the nuptial feast, which was sent over to the Earl's house.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="80"/>
When the king fled he passed by the seat of Sir <HI>William Moncrief,</HI> near <HI>Ern-bridge,</HI> who happening to be walking out at that time, heard from the mouth of his intrepid Majesty the whole relation; but the Knight found it so marvellous and so dis∣jointed, as plainly to tell the King, <HI>that if it was a true story, it was a very strange one.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Gowrie</HI> was a most accomplished gentleman: after he had finished his studies he held the Pro∣fessor of Philosophy's chair for two years, in one of the <HI>Italian</HI> universities.</P>
<P>Cross the <HI>Tay</HI> on a temporary bridge; the stone bridge, which is to consist of nine arches, being at this time unfinished; the largest arch is seventy-six feet wide; when complete, it promises to be a most magnificent structure.

<P><HI>Scone</HI> lies about a mile and half higher up,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Scone.</HI></NOTE> on the east bank of the river.

The house is built round two courts; the dining-room is large and handsome, has an antient but magnificent chimney-piece, the king's arms, with this motto, <HI>Nobis haec invicta miserunt centum sex Proavi.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="81"/>
Beneath are the <HI>Murray</HI> arms. In the drawing∣room is some good old tapestry, with an excellent figure of <HI>Mercury.</HI> In a small bed-chamber is a medly scripture-piece in needle-work, with a border of animals, pretty well done; the work of <HI>Mary Stuart,</HI> during her confinement in <HI>Loch-leven</HI> castle: but the house in general is in a manner unfurnished.</P>
<P>The gallery is about a hundred and fifty-five feet long; the top arched, divided into compartments, filled with paintings, in water colors, of different sorts of huntings; and that <HI>Nimrod, James</HI> VI. and his train, appear in every piece.</P>
<P>Till the destruction of the abby, the kings of <HI>Scotland</HI> were crowned here, sitting in the famous wooden chair, which <HI>Edward</HI> I. transported to <HI>Westminster-Abby,</HI> much to the mortification of the <HI>Scots,</HI> who esteemed it as their palladium. <HI>Charles</HI> II. before the battle of <HI>Worcester,</HI> was crowned in the present chapel.

<P>The country is good, full of barley, oats, and flax in abundance; but after a few miles travelling, is succeeded by a black heath: ride through a beau∣tifull plantation of pines, and after descending an easy slope the plain beneath suddenly contracts it∣self into a narrow glen: the prospect before me strongly marked the entrance into the <HI>Highlands,</HI> the hills that bounded it on each side being lofty and rude.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Birnam</HI> Wood.</NOTE> On the left was <HI>Birnam</HI> Wood,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Dunsinane</HI></NOTE> which seems never to have recovered the march its an∣cestors made to <HI>Dunsinane:</HI> I was shewn at a great distance a high ridge of hills, where some remains of that famous fortress * (<HI>Macbeth</HI>'s castle) are said yet to exist.</P>
<P>The pass into the <HI>Highlands</HI> is awefully magnifi∣cent; high, craggy, and often naked mountains present themselves to view, approach very near each other, and in many parts are fringed with wood, overhanging and darkening the <HI>Tay,</HI> that rolls with great rapidity beneath.

Lay at <HI>Inver,</HI> a good inn, on the west side of the river.</P>
<P>Crossed it in a boat, attended by a tame swan,<NOTE PLACE="marg">JULY 28.</NOTE> which was perpetually solliciting our favours by put∣ting its neck over the sides of the ferry-boat. Land in the Duke of <HI>Athol</HI>'s gardens, which are extremely pleasing, washed by the river, and commanding from different parts of the walks the most beautifull and picturesque views of wild and gloomy nature that can be conceived. Trees of all kinds grow here extremely well; and even so southern a shrub as <HI>Portugal</HI> laurel flourishes greatly. In the gardens are the ruins of the cathedral, once a magnificent aedifice, as appears by the beautifull round pillars still standing; but the choir is preserved, and at present used as a church. In the burial-place of the family is a large monument of the Marquis of <HI>Athol,</HI> hung with the arms of the numerous con∣nections of the family. In another part is a tomb of an old bishop.</P>
<P>On the other side the river is a pleasing walk along the banks of the water of <HI>Bran</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rivers in <HI>Scotland</HI> are very frequently called <HI>waters.</HI></NOTE>, a great and rapid torrent, full of immense stones. On a rock at the end of the walk is a neat building, impend∣ing over a most horrible chasm, into which the river precipitates itself with great noise and fury from a considerable height. The windows of the pavillion are formed of painted glass; some of the
<PB N="76" REF="85"/>
panes are red, which makes the water resemble a fiery cataract. About a mile further is another, <HI>rumbling brig,</HI> like, but inferior in grandeur, to that near <HI>Kinross.</HI></P>
<P>The town of <HI>Dunkeld</HI> is small, and has a small linnen manufacture. Much company resorts here, in the summer months, for the benefit of drinking goats milk and whey: I was informed here, that those animals will eat serpents; as it is well known that stags do.</P>
<P>After a ride of two miles along a narrow strait, amidst trees, and often in fight of the <HI>Tay,</HI> was driven by rain into a fisherman's hut, who enter∣tained me with an account of his business: said, he paid ten pounds <HI>per ann.</HI> for the liberty of two or three miles of the river; sold, the first fish of the season at three-pence a pound; after that, got three shillings <HI>per</HI> fish. The houses in these parts began to be covered with broom, which lasts three or four years: their insides mean, and very scantily furnished; but the owners civil, sensible, and of the quickest apprehensions.</P>
<P>The strait now widens into a vale plentifull in oats, barley and flax, and well peopled: on the right is the junction of the <HI>Tay</HI> and the <HI>Tumel:</HI> the channels of these rivers are wide, full of gravel, the mark of their devastation during floods. Due north is the road to <HI>Blair</HI> and <HI>Fort Augustus,</HI> through the noted pass of <HI>Killicrankie;</HI> turn to the left; ride opposite to <HI>Castle Menzies:</HI> reach <HI>Tay-mouth,</HI> the seat of the Earl of <HI>Breadalbane.</HI></P>

<HI>Taymouth</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Its name, in old maps, is <HI>Balloch;</HI> i. e. the mouth of the loch.</NOTE> lies in a vale scarce a mile broad,<NOTE PLACE="marg">JULY 29, &amp;c. <HI>Taymouth</HI></NOTE> very fertile, bounded on each side by high moun∣tains finely planted. Those on the south are co∣vered with trees, or with corn fields, far up their sides. The hills on the north are planted with pines and other trees, and vastly steep, and have a very <HI>alpine</HI> look; but particularly resemble the great slope opposite the <HI>grande Chartreuse</HI> in <HI>Dau∣phinè.</HI> His Lordship's policy <NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">This word here signifies improvements, or demesne: when used by a merchant, or tradesman, signifies their warehouses, shops, and the like.</NOTE> surrounds the house, which stands in the park, and is one of the few in which sallow deer are seen.</P>
<P>The ground is in remarkable fine order, owing to his Lordship's assiduity in clearing it from stones, with which it was once covered. A <HI>Blaster</HI> was in constant employ to blast the great stones with gun∣powder; for, by reason of their size, there was no other method of removing them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Berceau</HI> walk is very magnificent,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Walks.</NOTE> composed of great trees, forming a fine <HI>gothic</HI> arch; and pro∣bably that species of architecture owed its origin to such vaulted shades. The walk on the bank of the <HI>Tay</HI> is fifty feet wide, and two and twenty hundred yards long; but is to be continued as far as the junction of the <HI>Tay</HI> and the <HI>Lion,</HI> which is about as far more. The first runs on the sides of the walk with great rapidity, is clear, but not color∣less, for its pellucidness is like that of brown crystal; as is the case with most of the rivers of <HI>Scotland,</HI> which receive their tinge from the bogs.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="87"/>
The <HI>Tay</HI> has here a wooden bridge two hundred feet long, leading to a white feat on the side of the opposite hill, commanding a fine view up and down <HI>Straith-Tay.</HI> The rich meadows beneath, the wind∣ing of the river, the beginning of <HI>Lough-Tay,</HI> the discharge of the river out of it, the neat village and church of <HI>Kenmor,</HI> form a most pleasing and mag∣nificent prospect.</P>
<P>The view from the temple of <HI>Venus</HI> is that of the lake,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lough-Tay.</HI></NOTE> with a nearer sight of the church and village, and the discharge of the river. The lake is about a mile broad, and about fifteen long, bounded on each side by lofty mountains; makes three great bends, which adds to its beauty. Those on the south are well planted, and finely cultivated high up; interspersed with the habitations of the <HI>Highlanders,</HI> not singly, but in small groupes, as if they loved society or clanship: they are very small, mean, and without windows or chimnies, and are the disgrace of <HI>North Britain,</HI> as its lakes and rivers are its glory. <HI>Lough-Tay</HI> is, in many places, a hundred fathoms deep, and within as many yards of the shore, fifty-four.</P>
<P>Till the present year, this lake was supposed to be as incapable of freezing as <HI>Lough-Ness, Lough-Earn,</HI> and <HI>Lough-Each;</HI> tho' <HI>Lough-Raynac,</HI> and even <HI>Lough-Fine,</HI> an arm of the sea, often does. But in <HI>March</HI> last, so rigorous and uncommon was the cold, that about the 20th of that month this vast body of water was frozen over, in one part, from side to side, in the space of one night; and so strong was the ice, as greatly to damage a boat which was caught in it.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="88"/>
<HI>Lough-Tay</HI> abounds with Pike, Perch, Eels, Sal∣mon and Trout; of the last, some have been taken that weighed above thirty pounds. Of these spe∣cies, the <HI>Highlanders</HI> abhor Eels, and also Lam∣pries, fancying, from the form, that they are too nearly related to Serpents <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I was informed, that at the head of the lake are the remains of an old castle, called <HI>Finlarig,</HI> belonging to Lord <HI>Breadalbane,</HI> and of a park finely wooded with old oaks, chesnuts, and other timber.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The north side is less wooded, but more culti∣vated. The vast hill of <HI>Laurs,</HI> with beds of snow on it, through great part of the year, rises above the rest, and the still loftier mountain of <HI>Benmor</HI> closes the view far beyond the end of the lake. All this country abounds with game, such as Grous, Ptarmigans <NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot"><HI>Br. Zool. illustr.</HI> 21. <HI>tab.</HI> xiii.</NOTE>, Stags, and a peculiar species of Hare, which is found only on the summits of the highest hills,<NOTE PLACE="marg">White Hare</NOTE> and never mixes with the common kind, which is frequent enough in the vales <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The same, <HI>p.</HI> 40. <HI>tab.</HI> xlvii.</NOTE>. This species is grey in summer, white in winter; is smaller than the brown Hare, and more delicate meat.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ptarmigans</HI> inhabit the very summits of the highest mountains,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ptarmigan.</NOTE> amidst the rocks, perching among the grey stones, and during summer are scarce to be distinguished from them, by reason of their color. They seldom take long flights, but fly about like pigeons; are silly birds, and so tame as to suffer a stone to be slung at them without rising. It is not necessary to have a dog to find them. They taste so like a Grous, as to be scarce
<PB N="80" REF="89"/>
distinguishable. During winter, their plumage, ex∣cept a few feathers in the tail, are of a pure white, the color of the snow, in which they bury them∣selves in heaps, as a protection from the rigorous air.</P>
<P><HI>Royston</HI> Crows,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Birds.</NOTE> called here Hooded Crows, and in the <HI>Erse, Feanagh,</HI> are very common, and reside here the whole year. They breed in the hills, in all sorts of trees; lay six eggs; have a thriller note than the common sort; are much more mischievous; pick out the eyes of lambs, and even of horses, when engaged in bogs; but, for want of other food, will eat cranberries, and other mountain berries.</P>
<P>Ring Ouzels breed among the hills, and in au∣tumn descend in flocks to seed on the berries of the wicken trees.</P>
<P>Sea Eagles breed in ruined towers, but quit the country in winter; the black Eagles continue there the whole year.</P>
<P>It is very difficult to leave the environs of this delightfull place: and, before I go within doors, I must recall to mind the fine winding walks on the south side of the hills, the great beech sixteen feet in girth, the picturesque birch with its long stream∣ing branches, the hermitage, the great cataracts adjacent, and the darksome chasm beneath. I must enjoy over again the view of the fine reach of the <HI>Tay,</HI> and its union with the broad water of the <HI>Lion:</HI> I must step down to view the druidical circles of stones, called in the <HI>Erse, Tibberd;</HI> and lastly,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Tay-bridge.</HI></NOTE> I must visit <HI>Tay-bridge,</HI> and, as far as my pen can contribute, extend the same of our military coun∣trymen,

<P>Visited a pretty little island, tusted with trees, in <HI>Loch-Tay,</HI> not far from the shore: on it are the ruins of a priory, or dependent on that at <HI>Scoone;</HI> found∣ed in 1122, by <HI>Alexander</HI> the First, in which were deposited the remains of his Queen <HI>Sybilla,</HI> na∣tural daughter to <HI>Henry</HI> I. it was founded by <HI>Alex∣ander</HI> to have the prayers of the Monks for the re∣pose of his soul, and that of his royal confort <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As appears from a grant made by that Monarch of the isle in <HI>Loch-Tay, Ut Ecclesia</HI> DEI <HI>ibi pro me et pro Anima</HI> SYRILLAE <HI>Reginae ibi desuncta fabricetur,</HI> &amp;c.</NOTE>. To this island the <HI>Campbells</HI> retreated, during the suc∣cesses of the Marquiss of <HI>Montrose,</HI> where they de∣fended themselves against that hero, which was one cause of his violent resentment against the whole name.</P>
<P>Rode to <HI>Glen-lion;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">JULY 31.</NOTE> went by the side of the river <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">This river freezes; but the <HI>Tay,</HI> which receives it, never does.</NOTE> that gives name to it.

On the right is a rocky hill, called <HI>Shi-ballen,</HI> or the Paps. Enter <HI>Glen-lion</HI> through a strait pass: the vale is narrow, but fertile; the banks of the river steep, rocky, and wooded; through which appear the rapid water of the <HI>Lion.</HI> On the north is a round fortress, on the top of the hill; to which, in old times, the natives retreated, on any invasion.

<P>He also favoured me with the fight of a very antient brotche, which the Highlanders use, like the <HI>fibula</HI> of the <HI>Romans,</HI> to fasten their vest: it is made of silver, is round, with a bar cross the mid∣dle, from whence are two tongues to fasten the solds of the garments: one side is studded with pearl, or coarse gems, in a very rude manner; on the other, are certain letters I could not make out.</P>
<P>Return south, and come at once in fight of <HI>Loch-Tay.</HI> The day being very fine and calm, the whole scene was most beautifully repeated in the water. I must not omit that on the north side of this lake is a most excellent road, which runs the whole length of it, leading to <HI>Teindrum</HI> and <HI>Inve∣raray,</HI> in <HI>Argyleshire,</HI> and is the route which tra∣vellers must take, who make what I call the <HI>petit tour</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Which comprehends the route I have described; adding to it, from <HI>Taymouth,</HI> along the road, on the side of the lake, to <HI>Killin,</HI> 16 miles; from thence to <HI>Teindrum,</HI> 20; <HI>Glenorchie,</HI> 12; <HI>In∣veraray,</HI> 16; <HI>Luss,</HI> on the banks of <HI>Loch-lomond,</HI> 30; <HI>Dunbarton,</HI> 12; <HI>Glasgow,</HI> 15; <HI>Sterling,</HI> 31; <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> by <HI>Hopetoun</HI>-House, 35; a tract unparalleled, for the variety, and frequency of fine and magnificent scenery.</NOTE> of <HI>Scotland.</HI> This whole road was made at the

They will find the whole country excell in roads,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Roads.</NOTE> partly military, partly done by statute labor, and much by the munisicence of the great men.</P>
<P>I was informed, that Lord <HI>Breadalbane</HI>'s estate was so extensive that he could ride a hundred miles an end on it, even as far as the West Sea, where he has also some islands. These great properties are divided into districts, called <HI>Officiaries:</HI> a ground officer presides over each, and has three, four, or five hundred men under his care: he superintends the duties due from each to their Lord, such as fetching peat, bringing coal from <HI>Perth,</HI> &amp;c. which they do, at their own expence, on horses backs, travelling in strings, the tail of one horse being fastened by a cord, which reaches to the head of the next: the horses are little, and generally white or grey; and as the farms are very small, it is com∣mon for four people to keep a plough between them, each furnishing a horse, and this is called a horse gang.</P>
<P>The north side of <HI>Loch-Tay</HI> is very populous; for in sixteen square miles are seventeen hundred and eighty-six souls: on the other side, about twelve hundred. The country, within these thirty years, is grown very industrious, and manufactures a great deal of thread. They spin with rocks <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Their Lord gives among them annually a great number of spinning-wheels.</NOTE>, which they do while they attend their cattle on the hills;
<PB N="87" REF="97"/>
and, at the three or four fairs in the year, held at <HI>Taymouth,</HI> about sixteen hundred pounds worth of yarn is sold out of <HI>Breadalbane</HI> only.</P>
<P>Much of this may be owing to the good sense and humanity of the chieftain; but much again is owing to the abolition of the seudal tenures, or vassalage; for before that was effected (which was done by the influence of a Chancellor <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Earl of <HI>Hardwick.</HI></NOTE>, whose memory <HI>Scotland</HI> gratefully adores for that service) the Strong oppressed the Weak, the Rich the Poor. Courts indeed were held, and juries called; but juries of vassals, too dependent and too timid to be relied on for the execution of true justice.</P>

<PB N="88" REF="98"/>
with heath, bilberies, and dwarf arbutus, whose glossy leaves make a pretty appearance: this place gives shelter to black game, and is at present the farthest Southern resort of roes, for very few ever straggle lower down: near these woods is a saw∣mill, which brings in about 180l. <HI>per ann.</HI> the deal, which is the red sort, is fold in plank to different parts of the country, carried on horses backs, for the trees are now grown so scarce as not to admit of exportation <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Some Pot-Ash is also made of the Birch Wood:</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The lake affords no other fish than trouts, and bull trouts; the last, as I was informed, are some∣times taken of the length of four feet and a half: many water fowl breed in the birns or little streams that trickle into the lake; among others different sort of grebes, and divers: I was told of one which the inhabitants call <HI>Turuvachal,</HI> that makes a great noise before storms, and by their description seems to be the <HI>Fluder</HI> of <HI>Gesner.</HI></P>
<P>This country was once the property of <HI>Robertson,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Poet <HI>Struan.</HI></NOTE> of <HI>Struan,</HI> who had been in the rebellion of 1715; had his estate restored, but in 1745 rebelling a se∣cond time, the country was burnt, and the estate annexed to the crown: he returned a few years af∣ter, and died as he lived, a most abandoned sot; notwithstanding which he had a genius for po∣etry, and left behind him a volume of elegies, and other pieces, in some of which he elegantly laments the ravages of war among his vassals, and the loss of his favourite scenes, and in particular his foun∣tain <HI>Argentine.</HI></P>

The country is perfectly highland; and in spite of the intercourse this and the neighboring parts have of late years had with the rest of the world, it still retains some of its antient customs and supersti∣tions;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Superstitions.</NOTE> they decline daily, but least their memory should be lost, I shall mention several that are still practised, or but very lately difused in the tract I had passed over. Such a record will have this advantage when the follies are quite extinct, in teaching the unshackled and enlightened mind the difference between the pure ceremonies of religion, and the wild and anile flights of superstition.</P>
<P>The belief in spectres still exists;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Spectres.</NOTE> of which I had a remarkable proof while I was in the county of <HI>Breadalbane:</HI> a poor visionary, who had been working in his cabbage-garden, imagined that he was raised suddenly into the air, and conveyed over a wall into an adjacent corn-field; that he found himself surrounded by a crowd of men and women, many of whom he knew to have been dead some years, and who appeared to him skimming over the tops of the unbended corn, and mingling together like bees going to hive: that they spoke an unknown language, and with a hollow found: that they very roughly pushed him to and fro; but on his utter∣ing the name of GOD, all vanished but a female sprite, who seizing him by the shoulder, obliged him to promise an assignation, at that very hour, that day sevenight: that he then found that his hair was all tied in double knots, and that he had almost lost the use of his speech: that he kept his word with the spectre, whom he soon saw come floating thro' the air towards him: that he spoke to her, but she
<PB N="90" REF="100"/>
told him at that time she was in too much haste to attend to him, but bid him go away, and no harm should befall him; and so the affair rested when I left the country. But it is incredible the mischief these <HI>AEgri Somnia</HI> did in the neighborhood: the friends and relation of the deceased, whom the old Dreamer had named, were in the utmost anxiety at finding them in such bad company in the other world: the almost extinct belief of the old idle tales began again to gain ground, and the good minister will have many a weary discourse and ex∣hortation before he can eradicate the absurd ideas this idle story has revived.</P>
<P>In this part of the country the notion of witch∣craft is quite lost: it was observed to cease almost immediately on the repeal of the witch act; a proof what a dangerous instrument it was in the hands of the vindictive, or of the credulous.</P>
<P>Among the superstitious customs these are the most singular.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Unlucky day.</NOTE> A Highlander never begins any thing of consequence on the day of the week on which the 3d of <HI>May</HI> falls, which he styles <HI>Lagh Sbeacbanna na bleanagh,</HI> or the dismal day.</P>
<P>On the 1st of <HI>May,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bel-tein.</NOTE> the herdsmen of every vil∣lage hold their <HI>Bel-tein</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">My account of this, and every other ceremony mentioned in this Journal, was communicated to me by gentlemen resident on the spot where they were performed.</NOTE>, a rural sacrifice: they cut a square trench on the ground, leaving the turf in the middle; on that they make a fire of wood, on which they dress a large caudle of eggs, butter, oatmeal and milk; and bring, besides the ingre∣dients of the caudle, plenty of beer and whisky;
<PB N="91" REF="101"/>
for each of the company must contribute something. The rites begin with spilling some or the caudle on the ground, by way of libation: on that, every one takes a cake of oatmeal, upon which are raised nine square knobs, each dedicated to some particular being, the supposed preserver of their flocks and herds, or to some particular animal, the real de∣stroyer of them: each person then turns his face to the fire, breaks off a knob, and flinging it over his shoulders, says, <HI>This I give to thee, preserve thou my horses; this to thee, preserve thou my sheep;</HI> and so on. After that, they life the same ceremony to the noxious animals: <HI>This I give to thee, 0 Fox! spare thou my lambs; this to thee, O hooded Crow! this to thee, O Eagle!</HI></P>
<P>When the ceremony is over they dine on the caudle; and after the feast is finished, what is left is hid by two persons deputed for that purpose; but on the next <HI>Sunday</HI> they re-assemble, and finish the reliques of the first entertainment <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A custom, favoring of the <HI>Scotch Bel-tein,</HI> prevails in <HI>Gloucester∣shire,</HI> particularly about <HI>Newent</HI> and the neighboring parishes, on the twelfth day, or on the <HI>Epiphany,</HI> in the evening: all the servants of every particular farmer assemble together in one or the fields that has been sown with wheat; on the border of which, in the most conspicuous or most elevated place, they make twelve fires of straw, in a row; around one of which, made larger than the rest, they drink a chearful glass of cyder to their master's health, success to the future harvest, and then returning home they feast on cakes, made of carraways, &amp;c. soak'd in cyder, which they clame as a reward for their past labors in, sowing the grain. This seems to resemble a custom of the antient Danes, who, in their addresses to their rural deities, emptied, on every invocation, a cup in honor of them.

<P>On the death of a Highlander,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Funeral customs</NOTE> the corps being stretched on a board, and covered with a coarse
<PB N="92" REF="102"/>
linnen wrapper, the friends lay on the breast of the deceased a wooden platter, containing a small quan∣tity of salt and earth, separate and unmixed; the earth, an emblem of the corruptible body; the salt, an emblem of the immortal spirit. All fire is ex∣tinguished where a corps is kept; and it is reckoned so ominous, for a dog or cat to pass over it, that the poor animal is killed without mercy.</P>
<P>The <HI>Late-wake</HI> is a ceremony used at funerals:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Late-wake.</HI></NOTE> the evening after the death of any person, the rela∣tions and friends of the deceased meet at the house, attended by bagpipe or fiddle; the nearest of kin, be it wife, son, or daughter, opens a melancholy ball, dancing and greeting; <HI>i. e.</HI> crying violently at the same time; and this continues till day-light; but with such gambols and frolicks, among the younger part of the company, that the loss which occasioned them is often more than supplied by the consequences of that night. If the corps remains unburied for two nights the same rites are renewed. Thus, <HI>Scythian</HI>-like, they rejoice at the deliverance of their friends out of this life of misery.</P>
<P>The <HI>Coranich,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Coranich.</NOTE> or singing at funerals, is still in use in some places: the songs are generally in praise of the deceased; or a recital of the valiant deeds of him, or ancestors. I had not the fortune to be present at any in <HI>North Britain,</HI> but formerly as∣sisted at one in the south of <HI>Ireland,</HI> where it was performed in the fullness of horror. The cries are called by the <HI>Irish</HI> the <HI>'Ulogobne</HI> and <HI>Hûllulu,</HI> two words extremely expressive of the found uttered on these occasions, and being of <HI>Celtic</HI> stock, Etymo∣logists would swear to be the origin of the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>

of the <HI>Greeks,</HI> and <HI>Ululatus</HI> of the <HI>Latins. Virgil</HI> is very fond of using the last, whenever any of his females are distressed; as are others of the <HI>Roman</HI> Poets, and generally on occasions similar to this.</P>
<P>It was my fortune to arrive at a certain town in <HI>Kerry,</HI> at the time that a person of some distinction departed this life: my curiosity led me to the house, where the funeral seemed conducted in the purest classical form.</P>
<P><HI>Quodcunque aspicerem luctus gemitusque sonabant, Formaque non taciti funeris intùs erat.</HI></P>
<P>In short, the <HI>conclamatio</HI> was set up by the friends in the fame manner as <HI>Virgil</HI> describes that conse∣quential of <HI>Dido</HI>'s death.</P>
<P><HI>Lamentis gemituque et faemines ululatu Tecta fremunt.</HI></P>
<P>Immediately after this followed another ceremony, fully described by <HI>Cambden,</HI> in his account of the manners of the antient <HI>Irish;</HI> the earnest expostu∣lations and reproaches given to the deceased, for quitting this world, where she enjoyed so many blessings, so good a husband, such fine children. This custom is of great antiquity, for <HI>Euryalus</HI>'s mother makes the same pathetic address to her dead son.</P>
<P><HI>Tune ilia senectae Sera meae requies? potuisti relinquere solam Crudelis?</HI></P>
<P>But when the time approached for carrying out the corps the cry was redoubled.</P>

<P>A numerous band of females waiting in the outer court, to attend the herse, and to pay (in chorus)
<PB N="94" REF="104"/>
the last tribute of their voices. The habit of this sorrowing train, and the neglect of their persons, were admirably suited to the occasion: their robes were black, and flowing, resembling the antient <HI>Palla;</HI> their hair long, and disheveled: I might say,</P>
<P><HI>Vidi egomet nigra succinctam vadere palla</HI> Canidiam; <HI>pedibus nudis, passoque capillo Cum Sagana mojore ululantem.</HI></P>
<P>Among these mourners were dispersed the females, who sung the praises of the deceased, and were in the place of the <HI>Mulieres Praeficae</HI> of the <HI>Romans,</HI> and, like them, were a mercenary tribe. I could not but observe that they over-did their parts, as <HI>Horace</HI> acquaints us the mourners of his days did.</P>
<P><HI>Ut qui conducti plorant in funera, dicunt Et saciunt prope plura dolentibus ex animo.</HI></P>

<P>On going up a steep hill have a fine view of the lake. Where the mountains almost close, is <HI>Mount Alexander,</HI> where <HI>Struan</HI> once resided, and which he called his hermitage: it is a most romantic situa∣tion, prettily wooded, impending over a fine bason, formed by the <HI>Tumel,</HI> in a deep hollow beneath. At the bottom of this hill is <HI>Argentine,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Argentine.</NOTE> a little foun∣tain; to which he gave that name from the silvery <HI>micae</HI> it flings up: near this are several rude but beautifull walks amidst the rocks and trees, among which, in clifts and chasms, I was shewn the hard bed of the poor poet, when his disloyalty had made it penal for him to shew his head. Near this the rocks almost meet, and the river rushes with vast violence between. Some outlawed <HI>M<SUP>c</SUP> Gregors</HI> were once surprized on the opposite precipice, and all killed; one, who made a desperate leap upon a stone in the middle of the water, and another to the op∣posite side, had the hard fate to be shot in climb∣ing the opposite rocks.</P>

<P>Ascend a very steep and high hill through a great birch wood; a most picturesque scene, from the pendent form of the boughs waving with the wind from the bottom to the utmost summits of the

On attaining the top, had a view of a beautifull little <HI>Straith,</HI> fertile, and prettily wooded, with the river in the middle, forming numbers of quick meanders; then suddenly swelling into a lake, that fills the vale from side to side; is about three miles long, and retains the name of the river.

<P><HI>Blair</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Or the plain where a battle had been fought.</NOTE>, or <HI>Athol</HI>-House, seated on an eminence above a plain, watered by the <HI>Carrie,</HI> an outrageous stream, whose ravages have greatly deformed the vally, by the vast beds of gravel which it has left behind. The house was once fortified, and held a siege against the Rebels in 1746; but at present it is much reduced in height, and the inside highly finished by the noble owner. The most singular piece of furniture is a chest of drawers made of broom, most elegantly striped in veins of white and brown. This plant grows to a great size in <HI>Scot∣land,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Great broom trees.</NOTE> and furnishes pieces of the breadth of six inches.</P>
<P>Near the house is a fine walk surrounding a very deep glen finely wooded, but deficient in water at the bottom; but on the side of the walk on the rock is a small crystalline fountain, inhabited at that time by a pair of <HI>Naiads,</HI> in form of golden fish. In a spruce sir was a hang-nest of some un∣known bird,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hang-nest.</NOTE> suspended at the four corners to the boughs; it was open at top, an inch and a half in diameter, and two deep; the sides and bottom thick, the materials moss, worsted, and birch

<P>This country is very mountainous, has no natural woods except of birch; but the vast plantations that begin to cloath the hills will amply supply these defects.

<P>Visit the pass of <HI>Killicrankie,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Killierankie.</HI></NOTE> about five miles south of <HI>Blair:</HI> near the northern entrance was sought the battle between the Viscount <HI>Dundee</HI> and General <HI>Mackay,</HI> in which the first was killed in the moment of victory. The pass is extremely narrow, between high mountains, with the <HI>Carrie</HI> running beneath in a deep, darksome, and rocky channel, over-hung with trees, forming a scene of horrible grandeur. The road through this strait is very fine, formed by the soldiery lent by the Government, who have sixpence <HI>per</HI> day from the country besides their pay. About a mile beyond the pass, Mr. <HI>Robertson</HI>'s of <HI>Faskally,</HI> appears like fairy ground amidst these wild rocks, seated in a most beautifull meadow, watered by the river <HI>Tumel,</HI> surrounded with pretty hills finely wooded.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Athol</HI>'s estate is very extensive, and the country populous: while vassalage existed, the chieftain could raise two or three thousand fighting men, and leave sufficient at home to take care of

<PB N="99" REF="110"/>
the ground. The forests, or rather chases, (for they are quite naked) are very extensive, and feed vast numbers of Stags, which range, at certain times of the year, in herds of five hundred. Some grow to a great size: I have heard of one that weighed 18 stone, <HI>Scots,</HI> or 314lb. exclusive of head, entrails and skin. The hunting of these animals was formerly after the manner of an <HI>Eastern</HI> monarch. Thousands of vassals surrounded a great tract of country,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Great hunt∣ings.</NOTE> and drove the Deer to the spot where the Chieftains were stationed, who shot them at their leisure. The magnificent hunt, made by an Earl of <HI>Athol,</HI> near this place, for the amuse∣ment of <HI>James</HI> V. and the Queen-mother, is too remarkable to be omitted; the relation is therefore given as described by Sir <HI>David Lindsay</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Hist. Scotland,</HI> 266.</NOTE>, who, in all probability, assisted at it.</P>
<P><Q>The Earl of <HI>Athole,</HI> hearing of the King's coming, made great provision for him in all things pertaining to a prince, that he was as well served and eased, with all things necessary to his estate, as he had been in his own palace of <HI>Edin∣burgh.</HI> For I heard say, this noble Earl gart make a curious palace to the King, to his Mo∣ther, and to the Embassador, where they were s;o honourably eased and lodged as they had been in <HI>England, France, Italy,</HI> or <HI>Spain,</HI> concerning the time and equivalent, for their hunting and pastime; which was builded in the midst of a fair meadow, a fair palace of green timber, wind with green birks, that were green both
<PB N="100" REF="111"/>
under and above, which was fashioned in four quarters, and in every quarter and nuik thereof a great round, as it had been a block-house, which was lofted and gested the space of three house height; the floors laid with green scarets spreats, medwarts and flowers, that no man knew whereon he zeid, but as he had been in a garden. Further, there were two great rounds in ilk side of the gate, and a great portculleis of tree, falling down with the manner of a bar∣race, with a draw-bridge, and a great stank of water of sixteen foot deep, and thirty foot of breadth. And also this palace within was hung with fine tapestry and arrasses of silk, and lighted with fine glass windows in all airths; that this palace was as pleasantly decored, with all neces∣saries pertaining to a prince, as it had been his own palace-royal at home. Further, this Earl gart make such provision for the King, and his Mother, and the Embassador, that they had all manner of meats, drinks, and delicates that were to be gotten, at that time, in all <HI>Scotland,</HI> either in burgh or land; that is to say, all kind of drink, as ale, beer, wine, both white and claret, <HI>malvery, muskadel, Hippocras, aquavitae.</HI> Further, there was of meats, wheat-bread, main-bread and ginge-bread; with fleshes, beef, mutton, lamb, veal, venison, goose, grice, capon, coney, cran, swan, partridge, plover, duck, drake, brissel-cock and pawnies, black-cock and muir∣fowl, cappercaillies: and also the stanks, that were round about the palace, were full of all delicate fishes, as salmonds, trouts, pearches,
<PB N="101" REF="112"/>
pikes, eels, and all other kind of delicate fishes that could be gotten in fresh waters; and all ready for the banket. Syne were there proper stewards, cunning baxters, excellent cooks and potingars, with confections and drugs for their deserts; and the halls and chambers were pre∣pared with costly bedding, vessel and napery, according for a king, so that he wanted none of his orders more than he had been at home in his own palace. The King remained in this wilder∣ness, at the hunting, the space of three days and three nights, and his company, as I have shewn. I heard men say, it cost the Earl of <HI>Athole,</HI> every day, in expences, a thousand pounds.</Q></P>
<P>But hunting meetings, among the great men, were often the preludes to rebellion; for under that pretence they collected great bodies of men without suspicion, which at length occasioned an act of par∣lement prohibiting such dangerous assemblies.</P>
<P>Set out for the county of <HI>Aberdeen;</HI> ride eastward over a hill into <HI>Glen-Tilt,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">AUG. 3. <HI>Glen-Tilt.</HI></NOTE> famous in old times for producing the most hardy warriors; is a narrow glen, several miles in length, bounded on each side by mountains of an amazing height; on the south is the great hill of <HI>Ben y glo,</HI> whose base is thirty-five miles in circumference, and whose summit towers far above the others. The sides of many of these mountains are covered with fine verdure, and are excellent sheep-walks; but entirely woodless. The road is the most dangerous and the most hor∣rible I ever travelled; a narrow path, so rugged that our horses often were obliged to cross their
<PB N="102" REF="113"/>
legs, in order to pick a secure place for their feet; while, at a considerable and precipitous depth be∣neath, roared a black torrent, rolling through a bed of rock, solid in every part but where the <HI>Tilt</HI> had worn its antient way. Salmon force their passage even as high as this dreary stream, in spite of the distance from the sea, and the difficulties they have to encounter.</P>
<P>Ascend a steep hill, on the top of which we re∣freshed ourselves with some goats whey,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sheelins.</NOTE> at a <HI>Sheelin,</HI> or, as it is sometimes called, <HI>Arrie,</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>i. e.</HI> a house made of turf.</NOTE> and <HI>Bothay,</HI> a dairy-house, where the Highland shepherds, or gra∣ziers, live during summer with their herds and flocks, and during that season make butter and cheese. Their whole furniture consists of a few horn spoons, their milking utensils, a couch formed of sods to lie on, and a rug to cover them. Their food oat-cakes, butter or cheese, and often the coagulated blood of their cattle spread on their bannocks. Their drink milk, whey, and some∣times, by way of indulgence, whisky. Such dairy-houses are common to most mountainous countries: those in <HI>Wales</HI> are called <HI>Vottys,</HI> or Summer-houses; those on the <HI>Swiss Alps, Sennes.</HI></P>
<P>Dined on the side of <HI>Loch-Tilt,</HI> a small piece of water, swarming with Trouts. Continued our jour∣ney over a wild, black, moory, melancholy tract. Reached <HI>Brae-mar</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Brae,</HI> signifies the steep face of any hill.</NOTE>; the country almost instantly changed, and in lieu of dreary wastes, a rich vale, plenteous in corn and grass, succeeded. Cross the <HI>Dee</HI> near its head, which, from an insignificant
<PB N="103" REF="114"/>
stream, in the course of a very few miles, increases to the size of a great river, from the influx of num∣bers of other waters. The rocks of <HI>Brae-mar,</HI> on the east,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Brae-mar.</HI></NOTE> are exceedingly romantic, finely wooded with pine. The clifts are very lofty, and their front most rugged and broken, with vast pines growing out of their fissures.</P>
<P>This tract abounding with game, was, in old times, the annual resort of numbers of nobility, who assembled here to pass a month or two in the amusements of the chace. Their huntings resem∣bled campaigns; they lived in temporary cottages, called <HI>Lonquhards,</HI> were all dressed in an uniform habit conformable to that of the country, and passed their time with jollity and good chear, most admirably described by <HI>John Taylor,</HI> the water poet, who, in 1618, made there his <HI>Pennilesse Pilgrimage,</HI> p. 135, and describes the rural luxury with all the glee of a <HI>Sancho Panca.</HI></P>
<P><Q>I thank my good Lord <HI>Erskin,</HI> (says the Poet) hee commanded that I should alwayes bee lodged in his lodging, the kitchen being alwayes on the side of a banke, many kettles and pots boyling, and many spits turning and winding, with great variety of cheere: as venison bak'd, sodden, rost and stu'de beefe, mutton, goates, kid, hares, fresh salmon, pidgeons, hens, capons, chickens, partridge, moore-coots, heath-cocks, caperkellies, and termagants; good ale, sacke, white and cla∣ret, tent (or Allegant) and most potent <HI>aqua∣vitae</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The <HI>French,</HI> during the reign of <HI>Charles</HI> IX. seemed not only to have made full as large sacrifices to <HI>Diana</HI> and <HI>Bacchus,</HI> but even thought their entertainment incomplete without the presence of <HI>Venus. Jacques du Fouilloux,</HI> a celebrated writer on hunting of that age, with much seriousness describes all the requisites for the chace, and thus places and equips the jovial crew:—<Q>L'Assemblee se doit faire en quelque beau lieu soubs des arbres aupres d'une fontaine ou Ruisseau, la ou les veneurs se doiuent tous rendre pour faire leur rapport.

Pass by the castle of <HI>Brae-mar,</HI> a square tower, built about a hundred and fifty years ago, to curb the discontented chieftains; but at present unneces∣sarily garrisoned by a company of foot, being rented by the Government from Mr. <HI>Farquharson</HI> of <HI>Invercauld,</HI> whose house I reached in less than half an hour.</P>
<P><HI>Invercauld</HI> is seated in the centre of the <HI>Grampian</HI> hills, in a fertile vale, washed by the <HI>Dee,</HI> a large and rapid river: nothing can be more beautifull than the different views from the several parts of it. On the northern entrance, immense ragged and broken crags bound one side of the prospect; over whose grey sides and summits is scattered the melan∣choly green of the picturesque pine, which grows out of the naked rock, where one would think na∣ture would have denied vegetation.</P>
<P>A little lower down is the castle above-men∣tioned; formerly a necessary curb on the little kings of the country; but at present serves scarce any real purpose, but to adorn the landscape.</P>
<P>The views from the skirts of the plain, near <HI>Inver∣cauld,</HI> are very great; the hills that immediately bound it are cloathed with trees, particularly with birch, whose long and pendent boughs, waving a vast height above the head, surpass the beauties of the weeping willow.</P>
<P>The southern extremity is pre-eminently magni∣ficent; the mountains form there a vast theatre, the bosom of which is covered with extensive forests of pines: above, the trees grow scarcer and scarcer, and then seem only to sprinkle the surface; after

which vegetation ceases, and naked summits <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The highest is called <HI>Ben y bourd,</HI> under which is a small lough, which I was told had ice the latter end of <HI>July.</HI></NOTE> of a surprising height succeed, many of them topped with perpetual snow; and, as a fine contrast to the scene, the great cataract of <HI>Garval-bourn,</HI> which seems at a distance to divide the whole, foams amidst the dark forest, rashing from rock to rock, to a vast distance.</P>
<P>Some of these hills are supposed to be the highest part of <HI>Great Britain:</HI> their height has not yet been taken, but the conjecture is made from the great descent of the <HI>Dee,</HI> which runs from <HI>Brae-mar</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The most distant from the sea of any place in <HI>North Britain.</HI></NOTE> to the sea, above seventy miles, with a most rapid course.</P>
<P>Rode to take a nearer view of the environs; crossed the <HI>Dee</HI> on a good stone-bridge, built by the Government, and entered on excellent roads into a magnificent forest of pines of many miles extent.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pine Forest.</NOTE> Some of the trees are of a vast size; I mea∣sured several that were ten, eleven, and even twelve feet in circumference, and near sixty feet high, forming a most beautifull column, with a fine ver∣dant capital. These trees are of a great age, having, as is supposed, seen two centuries. The value of these trees is considerable; Mr. <HI>Farqubarson</HI> in∣formed me, that by sawing and retailing them, he has got for eight hundred trees five-and-twenty shillings each: they are sawed in an adjacent saw∣mill, into plank ten feet long, eleven inches broad, and three thick, and sold for two shillings apiece.</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="120"/>
Near this antient forest is another, consisting of smaller trees, almost as high, but very slender; one grows in a singular manner out of the top of a great stone, and notwithstanding it seems to have no other nourishment than what it gets from the dews, is above thirty feet high.</P>
<P>The prospect above these forests is very extraor∣dinary, a distant view of hills over a surface of ver∣dant pyramids of pines.</P>
<P>This whole tract abounds with game:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Stags.</NOTE> the Stags at this time were ranging in the mountains;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Roes.</NOTE> but the little Roebucks <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">These animals are reared with great difficulty; even when taken young, eight out often generally die.</NOTE> were perpetually bounding before us; and the black game often sprung under our feet.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Birds.</NOTE> The tops of the hills swarmed with <HI>Grous</HI> and <HI>Ptarmigans.</HI> Green Plovers, Whimbrels, and Snow-flecks <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Br.

Eagles <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">The Ring-tail Eagle, called here the Black Eagle. I suspect, from the description, that the Dotrel breeds here. I heard also of a bird, called here <HI>Snatach na cuirn,</HI> but could not procure it.</NOTE>, Peregrine Falcons, and Goshawks, breed here: the Falcons in rocks, the Goshawks in trees: the last pursues its prey an end, and dashes through every thing in pursuit; but if it misses its quarry ceases after two or three hundred yards flight. These birds are proscribed; half a crown is given for an eagle, a shilling for a hawk, or hooded crow.</P>
<P>Foxes are in these parts very ravenous, feeding on roes, sheep, and even she goats.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="121"/>
Rooks visit these vales in autumn, to feed on the different sort of berries; but neither winter nor breed here.</P>
<P>I saw flying in the forests the greater Bulfinch of Mr. <HI>Edwards, tab.</HI> 123, 124. the <HI>Loxia enucleator</HI> of <HI>Linnaeus,</HI> whose food is the seed of pine cones; a bird common to the north of <HI>Europe</HI> and <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P>On our return passed under some high clifts, with large woods of birch intermixed. This tree is used for all sorts of implements of husbandry,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Birch Woods.</NOTE> roofing of small houses, wheels, fuel; the Highlanders also tan their own leather with the bark; and a great deal of excellent wine is extracted from the live tree. Observed among these rocks a sort of pro∣jecting shelf, on which had been a hut, accessible only by the help of some thongs fastened by some very expert climbers, to which the family got, in time of danger, in former days, with their most valuable moveables.</P>
<P>The houses of the common people in these parts are shocking to humanity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cottages.</NOTE> formed of loose stones, and covered with clods, which they call <HI>devish,</HI> or with heath, broom, or branches of fir: they look, at a distance, like so many black mole-hills. The inhabitants live very poorly, on oatmeal, barley-cakes, and potatoes; their drink whisky sweetened with honey. The men are thin, but strong; idle and lazy, except employed in the chace, or any thing that looks like amusement; are content with their hard fare, and will not exert themselves far∣ther than to get what they deem necessaries. The women are more industrious, spin their own hus∣bands cloaths, and get money by knitting stockings,

the great trade of the county. The common wo∣men are in general most remarkably plain, and soon acquire an old look, and by being much exposed to the weather without hats, such a grin, and contraction of the muscles, as heightens greatly their natural hardness of features: I never saw so much plainness among the lower rank of females: but the <HI>ne plus ultra</HI> of hard features is not found till you arrive among the fish-women of <HI>Aberdeen.</HI></P>
<P>Tenants pay their rent generally in this country in money, except what they pay in poultry, which is done to promote the breed, as the gentry are so remote from any market. Those that rent a mill pay a hog or two; an animal so detested by the Highlanders, that very few can be prevaled on to taste it, in any shape. Labor is here very cheap, the usual pay being fifty shillings a year, and two pecks of oatmeal a week.</P>
<P>Pursued my journey east,<NOTE PLACE="marg">AUG. 6.</NOTE> along a beautifull road by the river side, in sight of the pine forests. The vale now grows narrow, and is filled with woods of birch and alder. Saw on the road-side the seats of gentlemen high built, and once defensible. The peasants cultivate their little land with great care to the very edge of the stony hills. All the way are vast masses of granite, the same which is called in <HI>Cornwall,</HI> Moor-stone.</P>
<P>The Glen contracts, and the mountains approach each other. Quit the <HI>Highlands,</HI> passing between two great rocks,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pass of <HI>Bellitir.</HI></NOTE> called the Pass of <HI>Bollitir,</HI> a very narrow strait, whose bottom is covered with the tremendous ruins of the precipices that bound the road. I was informed, that here the wind rages

with great fury during winter, and catching up the snow in eddies, whirls it about with such impe∣tuosity, as makes it dangerous for man or beast to be out at that time. Rain also pours down some∣times in deluges, and carries with it stone and gravel from the hills in such quantity, that I have seen these <HI>spates,</HI> as they are called, lie cross the roads, as the <HI>avelenches,</HI> or snow-falls, do those of the <HI>Alps.</HI> In many parts of the <HI>Highlands</HI> were <HI>bospitia</HI> for the reception of travellers, called by the <HI>Scotch, Spittles,</HI> or hospitals: the same were usual in <HI>Wales,</HI> where they are styled <HI>Yspitty;</HI> and, in both places, were maintained by the religious houses: as similar <HI>Asylums</HI> are to this day sup∣ported, in many parts of the <HI>Alps.</HI></P>
<P>This pass is the eastern entrance into the High∣lands. The country now assumes a new face: the hills grow less; but the land more barren, and is chiefly covered with heath and rock. The edges of the <HI>Dee</HI> are cultivated, but the rest only in patches, among which is generally a groupe of small houses. There is also a change of trees, oak being the principal wood, but not much of that Refreshed my horses at a hamlet called <HI>Tulloch,</HI> and looking west, saw the great mountain <HI>Lagbin y gair,</HI> which is always covered with snow.</P>

<P>ABERDEEN,<NOTE PLACE="marg">ABERDEEN.</NOTE> a fine city, lying on a small bay formed by the <HI>Dee,</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The bridge lies about two miles south of the town, and con∣siste seven neat arches.</NOTE> deep enough for ships of two hundred tuns. The town is about two miles in circumference, and contains thirteen thousand souls, and about three thousand in the suburbs. It once enjoyed a good share of the tobacco trade, but was at length forced to resign it to <HI>Glasgow,</HI> which was so much more conveniently situated for it. At pre∣sent, its imports are from the <HI>Baltic,</HI> and a few merchants trade to the <HI>West-Indies</HI> and <HI>North America.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Stocking trade.</NOTE> Its exports are stockings, thread, sal∣mon, and oat-meal: the first is a most important article, as appears by the following state of it. For this manufacture, 20,800 pounds worth of wool is annually imported, and 1600 pounds worth of oil. Of this wool is annually made 69,333 dozen pairs of stockings, worth, at an average, 1l. 10s. <HI>per</HI> dozen. These are made by the country people, in almost all parts of this great county, who get 4s. <HI>per</HI> dozen for spinning, and 14s. <HI>per</HI> dozen for knitting; so that there is annually paid

them 62,329l. 14s. And besides, there is about 2000l. value of stockings manufactured from the wool of the county, which encourages the breed of sheep much; for even as high as <HI>Invercauld,</HI> the farmer sells his sheep at twelve shillings apiece, and keeps them till they are four or five years old, for the sake of the wool. About 200 combers are also employed constantly. The thread manufacture is another considerable article, tho' trifling in com∣parison of the woollen.</P>
<P>The salmon fisheries on the <HI>Dee</HI> and the <HI>Don,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Salmon.</NOTE> are a good branch of trade: about 46 boats, and 130 men, are employed on the first; and in some years, 167,000lb. of fish have been sent pickled to <HI>London,</HI> and about 930 barrels of salted fish exported to <HI>France, Italy,</HI> &amp;c. The fishery on the <HI>Don</HI> is far less considerable.</P>
<P>The town of <HI>Aberdeen</HI> is in general well built, with granite from the neighboring quarries. The best street, or rather <HI>place,</HI> is the Castle-street: in the middle is an octogon building, with neat bas relievos of the Kings of <HI>Scotland,</HI> from <HI>James</HI> I. to <HI>James</HI> VII. The Town-house makes a good figure, and has a handsome spire in the centre.</P>
<P>The east and west churches are under the same roof; for the <HI>North Britons</HI> observe oeconomy even in their religion: in one I observed a small ship hung up; a common thing in <HI>Scotland,</HI> a sort of votive offering frequent enough in <HI>Popish</HI> churches, but appeared very unexpectedly here.</P>
<P>In the church-yard lies <HI>Andrew Cant,</HI> minister of <HI>Aberdeen,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Andrew Cant.</HI></NOTE> from whom the spectator derives the word to <HI>cant;</HI> but, in all probability, <HI>Andrew</HI> canted no

<P>In the same place are multitudes of long-winded epitaphs; but the following, though short, has a most elegant turn:</P>

<P>The college is a large old building,<NOTE PLACE="marg">College.</NOTE> founded by <HI>George</HI> Earl of <HI>Marechal,</HI> 1593. On one side is this strange inscription; probably alluding to some scoffers at that time:</P>

<P>The library is large.

<P>From a <HI>tumulus,</HI> called <HI>Tittie dron,</HI> now covered with trees, is a fine view of an extensive and rich corn country; once a most barren spot, but by the industry of the inhabitants brought to its present state.

<P><HI>Bowness,</HI> or <HI>Buchaness,</HI> the seat of the Earl of <HI>Errol,</HI> perched like a falcon's nest, on the edge of a vast clift above the sea. The drawing-room, a large and very elegant apartment, hangs over it; the waves run in wild eddies round the rocks be∣neath,
<PB N="119" REF="131"/>
and the sea fowl clamor above and below, forming a strange prospect and singular chorus. The place was once desensible, there having been a ditch and draw-bridge on the accessible side; but now both are destroyed.</P>
<P>Above five miles south is <HI>Slains,</HI> the remains of the old family castle, seated strongly on a penin∣sulated rock; but demolished in 1594, by <HI>James</HI> VI. on the rebellion of the Earl of <HI>Huntly.</HI> Near this place are some vast caverns, once filled with curious stalactical incrustations, but now destroyed, in order to be burnt into lime; for there is none in this country, that usefull commodity being im∣ported from the Earl of <HI>Elgin</HI>'s works on the <HI>Firth</HI> of <HI>Forth.</HI></P>
<P>Here the shore begins to grow bold and rocky, and indented in a strange manner with small and deep creeks, or rather immense and horrible chasms. The famous <HI>Bullers</HI> of <HI>Buchan</HI> lie about a mile north of <HI>Bowness:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Bullers</HI> of <HI>Buchan.</HI></NOTE> are a vast hollow in a rock, projecting into the sea, open at top, with a communication to the sea through a noble natural arch, thro' which boats can pass, and lie secure in this natural harbor. There is a path round the top, but in some parts too narrow to walk on with satisfaction, as the depth is about thirty fathom, with water on both sides, being bounded on the north and south by small creeks.</P>
<P>Near this is a great insulated rock, divided by a narrow and very deep chasm from the land. This rock is pierced through midway between the water and the top, and in great storms the waves rush through it with vast noise and impetuosity. On the

There are very fine Turbot taken on this coast; and towards <HI>Peterbead,</HI> good fisheries of Cod and Ling. The Lord of the Manour has 3l. 6s. 8d. <HI>per annum</HI> from every boat, (a six-man boat) but if a new crew sets up, the Lord, by way of encou∣ragement, finds them a boat. Besides these, they have little yawls for catching bait at the foot of the rocks.

<PB N="121" REF="133"/>
marked, these fish swim against the wind, and are much better tasted than those taken in fresh waters.</P>
<P>Most of the labor on shore is performed here by the women: they will carry as much fish as two men can lift on their shoulders, and when they have sold their cargo and emptied their basket, will re∣place part of it with stones: they go sixteen miles to sell or barter their fish; are very fond of finery, and will load their fingers with trumpery rings, when they want both shoes and stockings. The fleet was the last war supplied with great numbers of men from this and other parts of <HI>Scotland,</HI> as well as the army: I think near 70,000 engaged in the general cause, and assisted in carrying our glory through all parts of the globe: of the former, numbers returned; of the latter, very few.</P>
<P>The houses in this country are built with clay,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Houses.</NOTE> tempered in the same manner as the <HI>Israelites</HI> made their bricks in the land of <HI>AEgypt:</HI> after dressing the clay, and working it up with water, the la∣borers place on it a large stratum of straw, which is trampled into it and made small by horses: then more is added, till it arrives at a proper consistency, when it is used as a plaister, and makes the houses very warm. The roofs are <HI>sarked, i. e.</HI> covered with inch-and-half deal, sawed into three planks, and then nailed to the joists, on which the states are pinned.</P>
<P>The land prospect is extremely unpleasant; for no trees will grow here, in spite of all the pains that have been taken: not but in former times it must have been well wooded, as is evident from the numbers of trees dug up in all the bogs. The

fame nakedness prevales over great part of this coast, even far beyond <HI>Bamiss,</HI> except in a few warm bottoms.</P>

<P>INVERNESS, finely seated on a plain,<NOTE PLACE="marg">INVERNESS.</NOTE> between the Firth of the same name and the river <HI>Ness:</HI> the first, from the narrow strait of <HI>Ardersier,</HI> instantly widens into a fine bay, and again as suddenly con∣tracts opposite <HI>Inverness,</HI> at the ferry of <HI>Kessock,</HI> the pass into <HI>Rossshire.</HI> The town is large and well built, and very populous, being the last of any note in <HI>North Britain.</HI> On the north is <HI>Oliver</HI>'s Fort, a pentagon; but only the form remains to be traced by the ditches and banks. Near it is a very con∣siderable rope manufacture. On an eminence south of the town is old <HI>Fort George,</HI> which was taken and blown up by the Rebels: it had been no more than a very antient castle, the place where <HI>Boethius</HI> says that <HI>Duncan</HI> was murdered: from thence is a most charming view of the <HI>Firth,</HI> the passage of <HI>Kessock,</HI> the river <HI>Ness,</HI> the strange shaped hill of <HI>Tommin heurich,</HI> and various groupes of distant mountains.</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="151"/>
That singular <HI>Tommin</HI> is of an oblong form, broad at the base, and sloping on all sides towards the top; so that it looks like a great ship with its keel upwards. Its sides and part of the neigh∣boring plains are planted, so it is both an agreeable walk and a fine object. It is perfectly detached from any other hill; and if it was not for its great size, might pass <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Its length at top about 300 yards; I neglected measuring the base or the height, which are both considerable; the breadth of the top only 20 yards.</NOTE> for a work of art.

<P>Proceed north; have a fine view of the Firth, which now widens again from <HI>Kessock</HI> into a large bay some miles in length. The hills slope down to the water-side, and are finely cultivated; but the distant prospect is of rugged mountains of a stu∣pendous height, as if created as guards to the rest of the island from the fury of the boisterous north.

<P>The old house, which was very mean, was burnt down in 1746; but a neat box, the residence of the hospitable factor, is built in its stead on a high bank well wooded, over the pretty river <HI>Bewley,</HI> or <HI>Beaulieu.</HI> The country, for a certain circuit, is fertile, well cultivated, and smiling. The bulk of Lord <HI>Lovat</HI>'s estate was in these parts; the rest, to the amount of 500l. <HI>per ann.</HI> in <HI>Straitherick.</HI> He was a potent chieftain, and could raise about 1000 men: but I found his neighbors spoke as unfa∣vorably of him, as his enemies did in the most distant parts of the kingdom. His property is one of the annexed estates, <HI>i. e.</HI> settled unalienably on the crown, as all the forfeited fortunes in the High∣lands are:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Forfeited estates.</NOTE> the whole value of which brought in at that time about 6000l. <HI>per ann.</HI> and those in the Lowlands about the same sum; so that the power and interest of a poor twelve thousand <HI>per ann.</HI> terrified and nearly subverted the constitution of these powerfull kingdoms.</P>
<P>The profits or these estates are lodged in the hands of Trustees, who apply their revenue for the founding of schools for the instruction of chil∣dren in spinning; wheels are given away to poor families, and flax-seed to farmers.

<P>Near <HI>Freswick</HI> castle the cliffs are very lofty; the strata that compose them lie quite horizontally in such thin and regular layers, and so often inter∣sected by fissures, as to appear like masonry.

A boat of his was on a very tempestuous night at sea; his mind, filled with anxiety at the danger his people were in, furnished him with every idea of the misfortune that really befell them: he suddenly starting up pronounced that his men would be drowned, for that he had seen them pass before him with wet garments and dropping locks. The event was correspondent, and be from that time grew confirmed in the reality of spectral predictions.</P>
<P>There is another sort of divination, called <HI>Sleina∣nachd,</HI> or reading the <HI>speal-bone,</HI> or the blade-bone of a shoulder of mutton well scraped.

<P>I heard of one instance of second sight; or rather of foresight, which was well attested, and made much noise about the time the prediction was ful∣filled. A little after the battle of <HI>Preston Pans,</HI> the president, <HI>Duncan Forbes,</HI> being at his house of <HI>Cul∣loden</HI> with a nobleman, from whom I had the rela∣tion, fell into discourse on the probable consequences of the action: after a long conversation, and after revolving all that might happen, Mr. <HI>Forbes</HI> sud∣denly turning to a window, said, <HI>All these things may fall out; but depend on it, all these disturbances will be terminated on this spot.</HI></P>
<P>Returned the same road.

I saw many parties make a sort of halt for the sake of fishing; they soared to a great height, then darting down headlong into the sea made the water foam and spring up with the violence of their descent; after which they pursued their route.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Produce of <HI>Cathness.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Cathness</HI> may be called an immense morass, mixed with some fruitfull spots of oats and barley, much coarse grass, and here and there some fine, almost all natural, there being as yet very little artificial. At this time was the hay harvest both here and about <HI>Dunrobin:</HI> the hay on this rough land is cut with very short scythes, and with a brisk and strong stroke. The country produces and exports great quantities of <HI>oatmeal,</HI> and much whisky is distilled from the barley: the great thinness of inhabitants throughout <HI>Cathness</HI> enables them to send abroad much of its productions. No wheat had been raised this year in the county; and I was informed that this grain is sown here in the spring, by reason of the wet and fury of the winters.</P>
<P>The county is supposed to send out,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cattle.</NOTE> in some years, 2200 head of cattle; but in bad seasons, the farmer kills and salts numbers for sale. Great numbers of swine are reared here: they are short, high-backed, long-bristled, sharp, slender and long∣nosed; have long erect ears, and most savage looks, and are seen tethered in almost every field.

cheese, tallow, hides, the oil and skins of seals, and the feathers of geese.</P>
<P>Here are neither barns or graineries; the corn is thrashed out and preserved in the chaff in <HI>bykes,</HI> which are stacks in shape of bee-hives, thatched quite round, where it will keep good for two years.</P>

<P>In certain places, the death of people is supposed to be foretold by the cries and shrieks of <HI>Benshi,</HI> or the Fairies wife, uttered along the very path where the funeral is to pass; and what in <HI>Wales</HI> are called <HI>corps candles,</HI> are often imagined to appear, and foretell mortality.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Marriage customs.</NOTE> The courtship of the Highlander has these re∣markable circumstances attending it: after pri∣vately obtaining the consent of the Fair, he formally demands her of the father.

<P>The stockings are short, and are tied below the knee. The <HI>cuoranen</HI> is a sort of laced shoe made of a skin with the hairy side out, but now seldom worn. The <HI>truish</HI> were worn by the gentry, and were breeches and stockings made of one piece.</P>
<P>The <HI>fillebeg,</HI> i. e. little plaid, also called <HI>kelt,</HI> is a sort of short petticoat reaching only to the knees, and is a modern substitute for the lower part of the plaid, being found to be less cumber∣some, especially in time of action, when the High∣landers used to tuck their <HI>brechan</HI> into their girdle.

traveller, either in directing him on his way, or af∣fording their aid in passing the dangerous torrents of the Highlands: hospitable to the highest degree, and full of generosity: are much affected with the civility of strangers, and have in themselves a natu∣ral politeness and addrese, which often flows from the meanest when left expected. Thro' my whole tour I never met with a single instance of national reflection! their forbearance proves them to be su∣perior to the meanness of retaliation. I fear they pity us; but I hope not indiscriminately. Are exces∣sively inquisitive after your business, your name, and other particulars of little consequence to them: most curious after the politicks of the world, and when they can procure an old news-paper, will listen to it with all the avidity of <HI>Shakespear</HI>'s black∣smith. Have much pride, and consequently are impatient of affronts, and revengefull of injuries. Are decent in their general behaviour; inclined to superstition, yet attentive to the duties of religion, and are capable of giving a most distinct account of the principles of their faith. But in many parts of the Highlands, their character begins to be more faintly marked; they mix more with the world, and become daily less attached to their chiefs: the clans begin to disperse themselves through different parts of the country, finding that their industry and good conduct afford them better protection (since the due execution of the laws) than any their chief∣tain can afford; and the chieftain tafting the sweets of advanced rents, and the benefits of industry, damnisses from his table the crowds of retainers, the
<PB N="167" REF="182"/>
former instruments of his oppression and freakish tyranny.</P>
<P>Most of the antient sports of the Highlanders,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Highland</HI> sports.</NOTE> such as archery, hunting, fowling and Billing, are now difused: those retained are, throwing the <HI>putting</HI>-stone, or stone of <HI>strength</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Cloch neart.</HI></NOTE>, as they call it, which occasions an emulation who can throw a weighty one the farthest. Throwing the <HI>penny</HI>-stone, which answers to our coits. The <HI>shinty,</HI> or the striking a ball of wood or of hair: this game is played between two parties in a large plain, and furnished with clubs; which-ever side strikes it first to their own goal wins the match.</P>
<P>The amusements by their fire-sides were, the telling of tales, the wildest and most extravagant imaginable: musick was another: in former times, the harp was the favorite instrument, covered with leather and strung with wire <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Major</HI> says, <HI>Pro musicis instrumentis et musico concentu, Lyra syl∣vestres utuntur, cujus chordas ex aere, et non ex animaltum intestinis faciunt, in qua dulcissine madulantur.</HI></NOTE>, but at present is quite lost. Bagpipes are supposed to have been introduced by the <HI>Danes;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bagpipes.</NOTE> the oldest are played with the mouth, the loudest and most ear-piercing of any wind musick; the other, played with the singers only, are of <HI>Irish</HI> origin: the first suited the genius of this warlike people, rouzed their courage to battle, alarmed them when secure, and collected them when scattered. This instrument is become scarce since the abolition of the power of the chieftains, and the more industrious turn of the common people.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="183"/>
Vocal musick was much in vogue amongst them, and their songs were chiefly in praise of their antient heroes. I was told that they still have fragments of the story of <HI>Fingal</HI> and others, which they carrol as they go along; these vocal traditions are the foundation of the works of <HI>Ossian.</HI></P>
<P>Leave <HI>Inverness,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">AUG. 31.</NOTE> and continue my journey west for some time by the river-side: have a fine view of the plain, the <HI>Tommin,</HI> the town and the distant hills. After a ride of about six miles reached <HI>Lough-Ness</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This beautifull lake has a great resemblance to some parts of the lake of <HI>Lucerne,</HI> especially towards the east end.</NOTE>, and enjoyed along its banks a most romantic and beautifull scenery, generally in woods of birch, or hazel, mixed with a few holly, white∣thorn, aspin, ash and oak, but open enough in all parts to admit a sight of the water. Sometimes the road was strait for a considerable distance, and re∣sembled a fine and regular avenue; in others it wound about the sides of the hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ls which over∣hung the lake: the road was frequently cut thro' the rock, which on one side formed a solid wall; on the other, a steep precipice. In many parts we were immersed in woods; in others, they opened and gave a view of the sides and tops of the vast mountains soaring above: some of these were naked, but in general covered with wood, except on the meer precipices, or where the grey rocks denied vegetation, or where the heath, now glowing with purple blossoms, covered the surface. The form of these hills was very various and irregular, either broken into frequent precipices, or towering into rounded summits cloathed with trees; but not so

close but to admit a sight of the sky between them. Thus, for many miles, there was no possibility of cultivation; yet this tract was occupied by dimi∣nutive cattle, by Sheep, or by Goats: the last were pied, and lived most luxuriously on the tender branches of the trees. The wild animals that pos∣sessed this picturesque scene were Stags and Roes, black game, and Grous; and on the summits, white Hares and Ptarmigans. Foxes are so nume∣rous and voracious that the farmers are sometimes forced to house their Sheep, as is done in <HI>France,</HI> for fear of the Wolves <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is to me matter of surprize that no mention is made, in the Poems of <HI>Ossian,</HI> of our greater beasts of prey, which must have abounded in his days; for the Wolf was a pest to the country so late as the reign of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and the Bear existed there at lest till the year 1057, when a <HI>Gordon,</HI> for killing a fierce Bear, was directed by the King to carry three Bears heads in his banner. Other native animals are often mentioned in several parts of the work; and in the five little poems on night, compositions of as many Bards, every modern <HI>British</HI> beast of chace is enumerated, the howling Dog and howling Fox described; yet the howling Wolf omitted, which would have made the Bards night much more hideous.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The north side of <HI>Lough-Ness</HI> is far less beau∣tifull than the south. In general, the hills are less high, but very steep; in a very few places covered with brush-wood, but in general very naked, from the Hiding of the strata down their sloping sides. About the middle is Castle <HI>Urqhuart,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Castle <HI>Urqhuart.</HI></NOTE> a fortress founded on a rock projecting into the lake, and was said to have been the seat of the once powerfull <HI>Cummins.</HI> Near it is the broadest part of the Lough, occasioned by a bay near the castle.</P>

At <HI>Glen∣Moriston</HI> is a manufacture of linnen, where forty girls at a time are taught for three months to spin, and then another forty taken in: there are besides six looms, and all supported out of the forseited lands.</P>
<P>Above is the great mountain <HI>Meal Fourvounich,</HI> the first land sailors make from the east sea; on the top is a lake said to be 100 fathoms deep.</P>
<P>I was informed that in that neighborhood are glens and cascades of surprising beauty, but my time did not permit me to visit them.</P>
<P>Dined at a poor inn near the <HI>General's Hut,</HI> or the place where General <HI>Wade</HI> resided when he in∣spected the great work of the roads, and gave one rare example of making the soldiery usefull in time of peace.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Fall of <HI>Fyers.</HI></NOTE> About a mile farther is the fall of <HI>Fyers,</HI> a vast cataract, in a darksome glen of a stupendous depth; the water darts far beneath the top thro' a narrow gap between two rocks, then precipitates above forty feet lower into the bottom of the chasm, and the foam, like a great cloud of smoke, rises and fills the air. The sides of this glen are vast pre∣cipices mixed with trees over-hanging the water, through which, after a short space, the waters dis∣charge themselves into the lake.</P>
<P>About half a mile south of the first fall is ano∣ther passing through a narrow chasm, whose sides

it has undermined for a considerable way: over the gap is a true <HI>Alpine</HI> bridge of the bodies of trees covered with sods, from whole middle is an awefull view of the water roaring beneath.</P>
<P>At the fall of <HI>Fyers</HI> the road quits the side of the lake, and is carried for some space through a small vale on the side of the river <HI>Fyers,</HI> where is a mix∣ture of small plains of corn and rocky hills.

The fort consists of four bastions; within is the Governor's house, and barracks for 400 men: it was taken by the Rebels in 1746, who immediately deserted it, after demolishing as much as they could.</P>
<P><HI>Lough-Ness</HI> is twenty-two miles in length;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lough-Ness.</HI></NOTE> the breadth from one to two miles, except near Castle <HI>Urqbuart,</HI> where it swells out to three.

From an eminence near the fort is a full view of its whole extent, for it is perfectly
<PB N="172" REF="189"/>
strait, running from east to west, with a point to the south. The boundary from the fall of <HI>Fyers</HI> is very steep and rocky, which obliged General <HI>Wade</HI> to make that <HI>detour</HI> from its banks, partly on ac∣count of the expence in cutting through so much solid rock, partly through an apprehension that in case of a rebellion the troops might be destroyed in their march, by the tumbling down of stones by the enemy from above: besides this, a prodigious arch must have been slung over the Glen of <HI>Fyers.</HI></P>
<P>This lake,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Never freezes.</NOTE> by reason of its great depth, never freezes, and during cold weather a violent steam rises from it as from a furnace. Ice brought from other parts, and put into <HI>Lough-Ness,</HI> instantly thaws; but no water freezes sooner than that of the lake when brought into a house. Its water is esteemed very falubrious; so that people come or send thirty miles for it: old Lord <HI>Lovat</HI> in particular made constant use of it. But it is certain, whether it be owing to the water, or to the air of that neighbor∣hood, that for seven years the garrison of Fort <HI>Augustus</HI> had not lost a single man.</P>
<P>The fish of this lake are Salmon, which are in season from <HI>Christmas</HI> to <HI>Midsummer,</HI> Trouts of about 2lb. weight, Pikes and Eels. During win∣ter it is frequented by Swans and other wild fowls.</P>
<P>The greatest rise of water in <HI>Lough-Ness</HI> is four∣teen feet. The lakes from whence it receives its supplies are <HI>Lough-Oich, Louch-Garrie,</HI> and <HI>Lough-Quich.</HI> There is but very little navigation on it; the only vessel is a gally belonging to the fort, to bring the stores from the east end, the river <HI>Ness</HI> being too shallow for navigation.</P>

It is violently agitated by the winds,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Its agitations in 1755</NOTE> and at times the waves are quite mountainous. <HI>November</HI> 1st, 1755, at the same time as the earthquake at <HI>Lisbon,</HI> these waters were affected in a very extraordinary manner: they rose and flowed up the lake from east to west with vast impetuosity, and were carried above 200 yards up the river <HI>Oich,</HI> breaking on its banks in a wave near three feet high; then continued ebbing and flowing for the space of an hour: but at eleven o'clock a wave greater than any of the rest came up the river, broke on the north side, and overflowed the bank for the extent of 30 feet. A boat near the <HI>General's Hut,</HI> loaden with brush-wood, was thrice driven ashore, and twice carried back again; but the last time, the rudder was broken, the wood forced out, and the boat filled with water and left on shore. At the same time, a little isle, in a small lough in <HI>Badenoch,</HI> was totally reversed and slung on the beach. But at both these places no agitation was felt on land.</P>
<P>Rode to the Castle of <HI>Tor-down,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">SEPT. 1. Castle of <HI>Tor∣down</HI></NOTE> a rock two miles west of Fort <HI>Augustus:</HI> on the summit is an antient fortress. The face of this rock is a precipice; on the accessible side is a strong dyke of loose stones; above that a ditch, and a little higher a terrass sup∣ported by stones: on the top a small oval area, hollow in the middle: round this area, for the depth of near twelve feet, are a quantity of stones strangely cemented with almost vitrified matter, and in some places quite turned into black <HI>scoria:</HI> the stones were generally granite mixed with a few grit∣stones of a kind not found nearer the place than 40 miles.

<P>From this rock is a view of <HI>Ben-ki,</HI> a vast craggy, mountain above <HI>Glen-Garrie</HI>'s country. Towards the south is the high mountain <HI>Coryarich:</HI> the ascent from this side is nine miles, but on the other into <HI>Badenoch</HI> is very rapid, and not above one, the road being, for the ease of the traveller, cut in a zigzag fashion. People often perish on the summit of this hill, which is frequently visited during win∣ter with dreadfull storms of snow.</P>
<P>After a short ride westward along the plain,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SEPT. 2.</NOTE> reach <HI>Lough-Oich,</HI> a narrow lake; the sides prettily in∣dented, and the water adorned with small wooded isles.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Glen-Garrie,</HI></NOTE> On the shore is <HI>Glen-Garrie,</HI> the seat of Mr. <HI>M'Donald,</HI> almost surrounded with wood, and not far distant is the ruin of the old castle.

<P>After a small interval arrive on the banks of <HI>Lough-Lochy,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lough-Lochy.</HI></NOTE> a fine piece of water, fourteen miles long, and from one to two broad. The distant mountains on the north were of an immense height; those on the south had the appearance of fine sheep∣walks. The road is continued on the side of the lake about eight miles. On the opposite shore was <HI>Acbnacarrie,</HI> once the seat of <HI>Cameron</HI> of <HI>Lochiel,</HI>

but burnt in 1746. He was esteemed by all par∣ties the honestest and most sensible man of any that embarked in the pernicious and absurd attempt of that and the preceding year. By his influence he prevented the Rebels from committing several ex∣cesses, and even saved the city of <HI>Glasgow</HI> from being plundered, when their army returned out of <HI>England,</HI> irritated with their disappointment, and enraged at the loyalty that city had shewn. The Pretender came to him as soon as ever he landed. <HI>Lochiel</HI> seeing him arrive in so wild a manner and so unsupported, entreated him to desist from an enterprize from which nothing but certain ruin could result to him and his partizans. The Ad∣venturer grew warm, and reproached <HI>Lochiel</HI> with a breach of promise. This affected him so deeply, that he instantly went and took a tender and moving leave of his lady and family, foreseeing he was on the point of parting with them for ever. The in∣come of his estate was at that time, as I was told, not above 7001. <HI>per ann.</HI> yet he brought fourteen hundred men into the field.</P>

the arches are 95 feet high. This bridge was built by General <HI>Wade,</HI> in order to form a communica∣tion with the country. These publick works were at first very disagreeable to the old Chieftains: it lessened their influence greatly; for by admitting strangers among them their clans were taught that the Lairds were not the first of men. But they had another reason much more solid: <HI>Lochaber</HI> had been a den of thieves; and as long as they had their waters, their torrents and their bogs, in a state of nature, they made their excursions, could plunder and retreat with their booty in full security. So weak were the laws in many parts of <HI>North Britain,</HI> till after the late rebellion, that no stop could be put to this infamous practice. A contribution, called the <HI>black meal,</HI> was raised by several of these plundering chieftains over a vast extent of country: whoever payed it had their cattle ensured, but those. who dared to refuse were sure to suffer. Many of these free-booters were wont to insert an article, by which they were to be released from their agree∣ment, in case of any civil commotion: thus, at the breaking out of the last rebellion, a <HI>M'Gregor,</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Who assumed the name of <HI>Graham.</HI></NOTE> who had with the strictest honor (till that event) preserved his friends cattle, immediately sent them word, that from that time they were out of his protection, and must now take care of themselves. <HI>Barrisdale</HI> was another of this class, chief of a band of robbers, who spread terror over the whole coun∣try: but the Highlanders at that time esteemed the open theft of cattle, or the making a <HI>spreith</HI> (as
<PB N="177" REF="194"/>
they called it) by no means dishonorable; and the young men considered it as a piece of gallantry, by which they recommended themselves to their mistresses. On the other side there was often as much bravery in the pursuers; for frequent battles ensued, and much blood has been spilt on those occasions. They also shewed great dexterity in tracing the robbers, not only through the boggy land, but over the firmest ground, and even over places where other cattle had passed, knowing well how to distinguish the steps of those that were wan∣dering about from those that were driven hastily away by the Free-booters.</P>

The present fort is a triangle, has two bastions, and is capable of admitting a garrison of eight hundred men. It was well defended against the Rebels in 1746, who raised the siege with much disgrace. The fort lies on a narrow arm of the sea, called <HI>Loch-yell,</HI> which extends some miles higher up the country, making a bend to the north, and extends likewise westward towards the isle of <HI>Mull,</HI> near twenty-four <HI>Scotch</HI> miles.</P>

also a few horses bred here, and a very few sheep but of late several have been imported. Scarce any arable land, for the excessive wet which reigns here almost totally prevents the growth of corn, and what little there is fit for tillage sets at ten shillings an acre. The inhabitants of this district are therefore obliged, for their support, to import six thousand bolls of oatmeal annually, which cost about 4000l. the rents are about 3000l. <HI>per ann.</HI> the return for their cattle is about 75001. the horses may produce some trifle; so that the tenants must content themselves with a very scanty subsistence without the prospect of saying the lest against un∣foreseen accidents. The rage of raising rents has reached this distant country: in <HI>England</HI> there may be reason for it, (in a certain degree) where the value of lands is encreased by accession of com∣merce, and by the rise of the price of provisions; but here (contrary to all policy) the great men be∣gin at the wrong end, with squeezing the bag, before they have helped the poor tenant to fill it, by the introduction of manufactures. In many of the isles this already shews its unhappy effect, and begins to depopulate the country; for numbers of families have been obliged to give up the strong attachment the <HI>Scots</HI> in general have for their coun∣try, and to exchange it for the wilds of <HI>America.</HI></P>

The whole is placed on a cloth; the grinder pours the corn into the hole with one hand, and with the other turns round the upper stone with a very rapid motion, while the meal runs out at the sides on the cloth.

<P>Most of this long day's journey from the <HI>black mountain</HI> was truly melancholy, almost one conti∣nued scene of dusky moors, without arable land, trees, houses, or living creature, for numbers of miles.</P>
<P>The roads are excellent; but from <HI>Fort William</HI> to <HI>Kinloch-Leven,</HI> very injudiciously planned, often carried far about, and often so steep as to be scarce surmountable; whereas had the engineer followed the track used by the inhabitants, those inconve∣niences would have been avoided.</P>
<P>These roads, by rendering the highlands accessi∣ble, contributed much to their present improvement, and were owing to the industry of our soldiery; they were begun in 1723 <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide p.</HI> 81.</NOTE>, under the directions of Gen. <HI>Wade,</HI> who, like another <HI>Hannibal,</HI> forced his way through rocks supposed to have been uncon∣querable: many of them hang over the mighty lakes of the country, and formerly afforded no other road to the natives than the paths of sheep or goats, where even the Highlander crawled with difficulty, and kept himself from tumbling into the far subjacent water by clinging to the plants and bushes of the rock. Many of these rocks were too hard to yield to the pick-ax, and the miner was obliged to sub∣due their obstinacy with gunpowder, and often in places where nature had denied him footing, and where he was forced to begin his labors, suspended from above by ropes on the face of the horrible

precipice. The bogs and moors had likewise their difficulties to overcome; but all wore it length con∣strained to yield to the perseverence of our troops.</P>
<P>In some places I observed, that, after the manner of the <HI>Romans,</HI> they left engraven on the rocks the names of the regiment each party belonged to, who were employed in these works; nor were they less worthy of being immortalized than the <HI>Vexillatio</HI>'s of the <HI>Roman</HI> legions; for civilization was the con∣sequence of the labors of both.</P>
<P>These roads begin at <HI>Dunkeld,</HI> are carried on thro' the noted pass of <HI>Killicrankie,</HI> by <HI>Blair,</HI> to <HI>Dalna∣cardoch, Dalwhinie,</HI> and over the <HI>Coryarich,</HI> to <HI>Fort Augustus.</HI> A branch extends from thence eastward to <HI>Inverness,</HI> and another westward, over <HI>High-bridge,</HI> to <HI>Fort William.</HI> From the last, by <HI>Kinloch-Leven,</HI> over the <HI>Black Mountain,</HI> by the King's house, to <HI>Teindrum,</HI> and from thence, by <HI>Glen-urqhie,</HI> to <HI>Inveraray,</HI> and so along the beautifull boundaries of <HI>Lough-Lomond,</HI> to its extremity.</P>
<P>Another road begins near <HI>Crief,</HI> passes by <HI>Aber∣feldy,</HI> crosses the <HI>Tay</HI> at <HI>Tay-bridge,</HI> and unites with the other road at <HI>Dalnacardoch;</HI> and from <HI>Dal∣whinie</HI> a branch passes through <HI>Badenoch</HI> to <HI>Inver∣ness.</HI></P>
<P>These are the principal military roads; but there may be many others I may have over-looked.</P>

Near the new castle are some remains of the old.</P>
<P>This place will in time be very magnificent; but at present the space between the front and the water is disgraced with the. old town, composed of the most wretched hovels that can be imagined. The founder of the castle designed to have built a new founder on the west side of the little bay the house stands on: he finished a few houses, a custom-house, and an excellent inn: his death interrupted the completion of the plan, which, when brought to perfection, will give the place a very different appearance to what it now bears.</P>
<P>From the top of the great rock <HI>Duniquaich</HI> is a fine view of the castle the lawn sprinkled with fine trees, the hills covered with extensive plantations, a country fertile in corn, bordering the Lough,
<PB N="190" REF="207"/>
and the Lough itself covered with boats. The trees on the lawn about the castle are said to have been planted by the Earl of <HI>Argyle:</HI> they thrive greatly, for I observed beech from nine to twelve feet and a half in girth, pines nine, and a lesser maple between seven and eight.</P>
<P>But the busy scene of the herring-fishery gave no small improvement to the magnificent environs of <HI>Inveraray.</HI> Every evening <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The finery is carried on in the night, the herring being then in motion.</NOTE> some hundreds of boats in a manner covered the surface of <HI>Lough-Fine,</HI> an arm of the sea, which, from its narrow∣ness and from the winding of its shores, has all the beauties of a fresh-water lake: on the week-days, the chearfull noise of the bagpipe and dance eechoes from on board: on the sabbath, each boat approaches the land, and psalmody and devotion divide the day; for the common people of the north are disposed to be religious, having the example before them of a gentry untained by luxury and dissipation, and being instrusted by a clergy, who are active in their duty and who pre∣serve respect amids all the disadvantages of a narrow income.</P>
<P>The length of <HI>Lough-Fine,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lough-Fine.</HI></NOTE> from the eastern end to the point of <HI>Lamond,</HI> is above thirty <HI>Scotch</HI> mises; but its breadth scarce two measured: the depth from sixty to seventy fathoms:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Herrings.</NOTE> It is noted for the vast shoals of herrings that appear here in <HI>July</HI> and continue till <HI>January.</HI> The highest season is from <HI>September</HI> to <HI>Christmas,</HI> when near six hun∣dred
<PB N="191" REF="208"/>
boats, with four men in each, are employed. A chain of nets is used (for several are united) of a hundred fathoms in length. As the herrings swim at very uncertain depths, so the nets are sunk to the depth the shoal is found to take: the success therefore depends much on the judgement or good fortune of the fishers, in taking their due depths; for it often happens that one boat will take multitudes, while the next does not catch a single fish, which makes the boatmen perpetually enquire of each other about the depth of their nets. These are kept up by buoys to a proper pitch; the ropes that run through them are fastened with pegs, and by drawing up or letting out the rope (after taking out the pegs) they adjust their situation, and then replace them. Sometimes the fish swim in twenty fathom water, sometimes in fifty, and oftentimes even at the bottom.</P>
<P>It is computed that each boat gets about 40l. in the season. The fish are either salted, and packed in barrels for exportation, or sold fresh to the country people, two or three hundred horses being brought every day to the water-side from very distant parts. A barrel holds 500 herrings, if they are of the best kind; at a medium, 700: but if more, for some∣times a barrel will hold 1000, they are reckoned very poor. The present price 1l. 4s. <HI>per</HI> barrel; but there is a drawback of the duty on salt for those that are exported.</P>
<P>The great rendezvous of vessels for the fishery off the western isles is at <HI>Cambeltown,</HI> in <HI>Cantyre,</HI> where they clear out on the 12 th of <HI>September,</HI> and some∣times three hundred busses are seen there at a time:
<PB N="192" REF="209"/>
they must return to their different ports by <HI>January</HI> 13th, where they ought to receive the praemium of 2l. 10s. <HI>per</HI> tun of herrings; but it is said to be very ill paid, which is a great discouragement to the fishery.</P>
<P>The herrings of <HI>Lough-Fine</HI> are as uncertain in their migration as they are on the coast of <HI>Wales.</HI> They had for numbers of years quitted that water; but appeared again there within these dozen years. Such is the case with the loughs on all this western coast, not but people despair too soon of finding them, from one or two unsuccessfull tryals in the beginning of the season; perhaps from not adjusting their nets to the depth the fish happen then to swim in: but if each year a small vessel of two was sent to make a thorough tryal in every branch of the sea on this coast, they would undoubtedly find shoals of fish in one or other.</P>

It is an idle observation of tra∣vellers, that seeing one is the same with seeing all of these superb waters; for almost every one I visited has its proper characters.</P>
<P><HI>Lough-Leven</HI> is a broad expanse, with isles and cultivated shores.</P>

<P><HI>Lough-Moy</HI> is small, and has soft features on its banks, amidst rude environs.</P>

<P><HI>Lough-Oich</HI> has lofty mountains at a small dis∣tance from its borders; the shores indented, and the water decorated with isles.</P>
<P><HI>Lough-Lochy</HI> wants the isles; its shores slope, and several straiths terminate on its banks.</P>
<P><HI>Lough-Aw</HI> is long and waving: its little isles tusted with trees, and just appearing above the water, its two great seeds of water at each ex∣tremity, and its singular lateral discharge near one of them, sufficiently mark this great lake.</P>
<P><HI>Lough-Lomond,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lough-Lomond.</HI></NOTE> the last, the most beautifull of the <HI>Caledonian</HI> lakes.

themselves, not only by the redness of their hair; but by their still retaining the mischievous disposi∣tion of their ancestors.</P>
<P>On the west side, the mountains are cloathed hear the bottoms with woods of oak quite to the water edge; their summits lofty, naked and craggy.</P>
<P>On the east side, the mountains are equally high; but the tops form a more even ridge parallel to the lake, except where <HI>Ben-Lomond</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Its height is 3240 feets.</NOTE>, like <HI>Saul</HI> amidst his companions, overtops the rest. The upper parts were black and barren; the lower had great marks of fertility, or at left of industry, for the yellow corn was finely contrasted with the ver∣dure of the groves intermixed with it.</P>
<P>This eastern boundary is part of the <HI>Grampian</HI> hills,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Grampian</HI> hills.</NOTE> which extend from hence through the coun∣ties of <HI>Perth, Angus, Mearns,</HI> and <HI>Aberdeen.</HI> They take their name from only a single hill, the <HI>Mons Grampius</HI> of <HI>Tacitus,</HI> where <HI>Galgacus</HI> waited the approach of <HI>Agricola,</HI> and where the battle was fought so fatal to the brave <HI>Caledonians.</HI> Anti∣quarians have not agreed upon the particular spot; but the able Mr. <HI>Gordon</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Itin.

A great headland covered with trees separates the first scene from one totally different. On pass∣ing this cape an expanse of water bursts at once on your eye, varied with all the softer beauties of na∣ture. Immediately beneath is a flat covered with wood and corn: beyond, the headlands stretch far into the water, and consist of gentle risings; many have their surfaces covered with wood, others adorned with trees loosely scattered either over a fine verdure, or the purple bloom of the heath. Numbers of islands are dispersed over the lake of the same elevated form as the little capes, and wooded in the same manner; others just peep above the surface, and are tusted with trees; and num∣bers are so disposed as to form magnificent vistos between.</P>
<P>Opposite <HI>Luss,</HI> at a small distance from shore, is a mountainous isle almost covered with wood; is near half a mile long, and has a most fine effect. I could not count the number of islands, but was told there are twenty-eight: the largest two miles long, and stocked with Deer.</P>
<P>The length of this charming lake is 24 <HI>Scotch</HI> miles; its greatest breadth eight: its greatest depth a hundred and twenty fathoms. Besides the fish common to the <HI>Loughs</HI> are <HI>Guiniads,</HI> called here <HI>Poans.</HI></P>
<P>The country from <HI>Luss</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A tolerable inn on the borders of the lake.</NOTE> to the southern ex∣tremity of the lake continually improves; the mountains sink gradually into small hills; the land is highly cultivated, well planted, and well inha∣bited.</P>

I was struck with rapture at a sight so long new to me: it would have been without alloy, had it not been dashed with the uncertainty whether the mountain virtue, hospitality, would flourish with equal vigor in the softer scenes I was on the point of entering on; for in the <HI>Highlands</HI> every house gave welcome to the traveller.</P>
<P>The vale between the end of the lake and <HI>Dun∣barton</HI> is unspeakably beautifull, very fertile, and finely watered by the great and rapid river <HI>Levin,</HI> the discharge of the lake, which, after a short course, drops into the Firth of <HI>Clyde</HI> below <HI>Dunbarton:</HI> there is scarcely a spot on its banks but what is cultivated with bleacheries, plantations and <HI>villas.</HI> Nothing can equal the contrast in this day's journey, between the black barren dreary glens of the morn∣ing ride, and the soft scenes of the evening, islands worthy of the retreat of <HI>Armida,</HI> and which <HI>Rinaldo</HI> himself would have quitted with a sigh.</P>
<P>Before I take my last leave of the <HI>Highlands,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Entrances into the <HI>Highlands.</HI></NOTE> it would be proper to observe that every entrance into them is strongly marked by nature.</P>

At a distance are some gentle risings, interspersed with woods and villas belonging to the citizens of <HI>Glasgow,</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">GLASGOW.</NOTE> The best built of any modern second-rate city I ever saw: the houses of stone, and in a good taste. The principal street runs east and west, and is near a mile and a half long; but unfortunately, is not strait. The <HI>Tolbooth</HI> is large and handsome. Next to that is the Exchange: within is a spacious room with full-length portraits of all our monarchs since <HI>James</HI> I. and an excellent one, by <HI>Ramsay,</HI> of <HI>Archibald</HI> Duke of <HI>Argyle,</HI> in a Judge's robe. Before the Exchange is a large equestrian statue of King <HI>William.</HI> This is the broadest and finest part of the street: many of the houses are built over piazzas, but too narrow to be of much service to walkers. Numbers of other streets cross this at right angles, and are in general well built.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Market places.</NOTE> The market-places are great ornaments to this city, the fronts being done in a very fine taste, and the gates adorned with columns of one or other of the orders. Some of these markets are for meal, greens, fish, or flesh. There are two for the last, which have conduits out of several of the pillars; so that they are constantly kept sweet and clean.</P>
<P>Near the meal-market is a publick grainary, to be filled on any apprehension of scarceness.</P>
<P>The guard-house is in the great street, which is kept by the inhabitants, who regularly do duty. An excellent police is observed here, and proper officers attend the markets to prevent any abuses.</P>
<P>The old bridge over the <HI>Clyde</HI> consists of eight arches, and was built 400 years ago by Bishop
<PB N="201" REF="218"/>
<HI>Rea;</HI> two others are now building. The tide flows three miles higher up the country, but at low water is fordable. There is a plan for deepening the channel; for at present the tide brings up only very small vessels; and the ports belonging to this city lie fourteen miles lower, at <HI>Port Glasgow</HI> and <HI>Greenock,</HI> on the west side of the <HI>Firth.</HI></P>
<P>Near the bridge is a large alms-house, a vast nailery, a stone-ware manufacture, and a great porter brewery, which supplies some part of unin∣dustrious <HI>Ireland.</HI> Within fight, on the south side, are collieries; and much coal is exported into the last-mentioned island, and into <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P>The great imports of this city are tobacco and sugar: of the former,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trade.</NOTE> above 40,000 hogsheads have been annually imported, and near 20,000 again exported into <HI>France.</HI> The manufactures here are linnens, cambricks <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The greatest cambrick manufacture is now at <HI>Paisly,</HI> a few miles from this city.</NOTE>, lawns, tapes, sustians, and striped linnens; so that it already begins to rival <HI>Manchester,</HI> and has in point of the conveniency of its ports, in respect to <HI>America,</HI> a great advantage over it.</P>
<P>The college is a large building, with a handsome front to the street,<NOTE PLACE="marg">College.</NOTE> resembling some of the old col∣leges in <HI>Oxford. Charles</HI> I. subscribed 2001. to∣wards this work, but was prevented by the troubles from paying it; but <HI>Cromwell</HI> afterwards fulfilled the design of the royal donor. It was founded in 1450, by <HI>James</HI> II. Pope <HI>Nicholas</HI> I. gave the bull, but Bishop <HI>Turnbull</HI> supplied the money. There are about 400 students belonging to the col∣lege,
<PB N="202" REF="219"/>
who lodge in the town: but the Professors have good houses in the college. Young gentlemen of fortune have private tutors, who have an eye to their conduct; the rest live entirely at their own discretion.</P>
<P>The library is a very handsome room, with a gal∣lery round it, supported by pillars. That benefi∣cent nobleman the late Duke of <HI>Chandos,</HI> when he visited the college, gave 500l. towards building this apartment.</P>
<P>Messrs. <HI>Robert</HI> and <HI>Andrew Faulis,</HI> printers and booksellers to the university, have instituted an academy for painting and engraving; and like good citizens, zealous to promote the welfare and honor of their native place, have at vast expence formed a most numerous collection of paintings from abroad, in order to form the taste of their <HI>cleves.</HI></P>
<P>The printing is a very considerable branch of business, and has long been celebrated for the beauty of the types and the correctness of the edi∣tions. Here are preserved in cases numbers of monumental and other stones<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Several have been engraven by the artists of the academy.

<P>The cathedral is a large pile,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Churches.</NOTE> now divided into two churches: beneath, and deep under ground,
<PB N="203" REF="220"/>
is another, in which is also divine service, where the congregation may truely say, <HI>clamavi e pro∣fundis:</HI> the roof is fine, made of stone, and sup∣ported by pillars; but the beauty much hurt by the crowding of the pews. Near this is the ruin of the castle, or Bishop's palace.</P>
<P>The new church is a very handsome building, with a large elegant porch; but the outside is much dissigured by a slender square tower with a pepper-box top: and in general, the steeples of <HI>Glasgow</HI> are in a remarkable bad taste, being, in fact, no favorite part of architecture with the church of <HI>Scotland.</HI> The inside of that just spoken of is most neatly finished, supported by pillars, and very prettily stuccoed: it is one of the very few excep∣tions to the slovenly and indecent manner in which Presbitery keeps the houses of GOD: reformation in matters of religion seldom observes mediocrity: here it was outrageous; for a place of worship commonly neat was deemed to savor of popery; but, to avoid the imputation of that extreme, they run into another; for in many parts of <HI>Scotland</HI> our LORD seems still to be worshipped in a stable, and often in a very wretched one. Many of the churches are thatched with heath, and in some places are in such bad repair as to be half open at top; so that the people appear to worship, as the <HI>Druids</HI> did of old, in open temples.</P>

<P><HI>Hamilton</HI> House,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Hamilton.</HI></NOTE> or Palace, as it is called here, is seated at the end of a small town; is a large disagreeable pile of building, with two deep wings at right angles with the centre. The gallery is of great extent, and furnished (as well as some other rooms) with most excellent paintings: that of <HI>Da∣niel</HI> in the Lion's den, by <HI>Rubens,</HI> is a great per∣formance: the fear and devotion of the prophet is finely expressed by his uplifted face and eyes, his clasped hands, his swelling muscles, and the violent extension of one foot: a Lion looks fiercely at him with open mouth, and seems only restrained by the almighty power from making him fall a victim to his hunger; and the signal deliverance of <HI>Daniel</HI> is more fully marked by the number of human bones scattered over the floor, as if to shew the instant fate of others, in whose favor the Deity did not interfere.</P>
<P>The marriage-feast, by <HI>Paul Veronese,</HI> is a fine piece, and the obstinacy and resistance of the in∣truder,
<PB N="205" REF="222"/>
who came without the wedding garment, is strongly expressed.</P>

<PB N="216" REF="235"/>
kinds, I continued my journey south, through a rich corn country, leaving the <HI>Pentland</HI> hills to the west, whose sides were covered with a fine turf. Before I reached <HI>Crook,</HI> a small village, the country grew worse: after this it assumed a Highland appearance, the hills were high, the vales narrow, and there was besides a great scarcity of trees, and hardly any corn; instead, was abundance of good pasturage for sheep, there being great numbers in these parts, which supply the north of <HI>England.</HI> The roads are bad, narrow, and often on the edges of precipices, im∣pending over the river <HI>Tweed,</HI> here an inconsiderable stream. Reach</P>
<P>MOFFAT,<NOTE PLACE="marg">MOFFAT.</NOTE> a small neat town, famous for its spaws; one said to be usefull in scrophulous cases, the other a chalybeate, which makes this place much resorted to in summer. Doctor <HI>Walker,</HI> mi∣nister of the place, shewed me in manuscript his natural history of the <HI>western isles,</HI> which will do him much credit whenever he savors the world with it.</P>
<P>The country between <HI>Mossat</HI> and <HI>Lockerby</HI> is very good,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SEPT. 19.</NOTE> a mixture of downs and corn-land, with a few small woods: the country grows quite flat and very unpleasant. Cross a small river called the <HI>Sark,</HI> which divides the two kingdoms, and enter CUMBERLAND.</P>
<P>About three miles farther cross the <HI>Esk</HI> over a handsome stone-bridge, and lie at the small village of <HI>Longtown.</HI> The country is very rich in corn, but quite bare of trees, and very flat. Near this village, at <HI>Netberby,</HI> are the ruins of a <HI>Roman</HI> sta∣tion,

<P>Cross the <HI>Eden</HI> to <HI>Carlisle,</HI> a pleasant city, sur∣rounded with walls,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SEPT. 20. <HI>Carlisle.</HI></NOTE> like <HI>Chester,</HI> but they are very dirty, and kept in very bad repair. The castle is an∣tient, but makes a good appearance at a distance: the view from it is fine, of rich meadows, at this time covered with thousands of cattle, it being fair-day. The <HI>Eden</HI> here forms two branches, and insulates the ground; over one is a bridge of four, over the other one of nine arches. There is besides a pros∣pect of a rich country, and a distant view of <HI>Cold∣fells, Cross-fells, Skiddaw,</HI> and other mountains.</P>
<P>The cathedral <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Begun by <HI>Walter,</HI> deputy of these parts, under <HI>William Rusus;</HI> but the new choir was not founded till about 1354.</NOTE> is very imperfect, <HI>Cromwell</HI> hav∣ing pulled down part to build barracks with the materials. There remains some portion that was built in the <HI>Saxon</HI> times, with very maffy pillars and round arches. The rest is more modern, said to have been built in the reign of <HI>Edward</HI> III. who had in one part an apartment to lodge in. The arches in this latter building are sharp-pointed: the east window remarkably fine.</P>
<P>The manufactures of <HI>Carlisle</HI> are chiefly of printed linnens, for which near 3000l;. <HI>per ann.</HI> is paid in duties. It is also noted for a great manu∣facture of whips, which employs numbers of chil∣dren.</P>
<P>Salmons appear in the <HI>Eden</HI> in numbers so early as the months of <HI>December</HI> and <HI>January;</HI> and the <HI>London,</HI> and even <HI>Newcastle</HI> markets, are supplied with early fish from this river: but it is remarkable,
<PB N="218" REF="237"/>
that they do not visit the <HI>Esk</HI> in any quantity till <HI>April,</HI> notwithstanding the mouths of both these waters arc at a small distance from each other. I omitted in its proper place an account of the <HI>New∣castle</HI> fishery, therefore insert here the little I could collect relating to it: the fish seldom appear in the <HI>Tyne</HI> till <HI>February:</HI> there are about 24 fisheries on the river, besides a very considerable were, and the whole annual capture amounts to about 36,000 fish. I was informed that once the fish were brought from <HI>Berwick</HI> and cured at <HI>Newcastle;</HI> but at pre∣sent, notwithstanding all goes under the name of <HI>Newcastle</HI> Salmon, very little is taken there, in comparison of what is caught in the <HI>Tweed.</HI></P>
<P>The country near <HI>Carlisle</HI> consists of small en∣closures; but a little farther on, towards <HI>Penrith,</HI> changes into coarse downs. On the east, at a dif∣tance, are ridges of high hills running parallel to the road, with a good inclosed country in the inter∣vening space. Above <HI>Penrith</HI> is a rich inclosed tract, mixed with hedge-row trees and woods. On the south-west, a prospect of high and craggy mountains. After I left <HI>Lockerby,</HI> Nature, as if exhausted with her labors in the lofty hills of <HI>Scot∣land,</HI> seemed to have lain down and reposed herself for a considerable space; but here began to rise again with all the sublimity of <HI>alpine</HI> majesty.</P>
<P>PENRITH is an antient town,<NOTE PLACE="marg">PENRITH.</NOTE> seated at the foot of a hill: is a great thoroughfare for travellers; but has little other trade, except a small one of checks. The church is very neat, the gallery sup∣ported by large columns, each formed of a single stone. In the chuech-yard is s monument of great
<PB N="219" REF="238"/>
antiquity, consisting of two stone pillars eleven feet six inches high, and five in circumference in the lower part, which is rounded; the upper is square, and tapers to a point: in the square part is some fret-work, and the relievo of a cross. Both these stones are mortifed at their lower part into a round one: they are about fifteen feet asunder; the space between them is inclosed on each side with two very large but thin semicircular stones; so that there is left a walk between pillar and pillar of two feet in breadth. Two of these lesser stones are plain, the other two, have certain figures at present scarce intelligible.</P>
<P>Cross the <HI>Emot,</HI> a small river, and soon after the <HI>Lowther,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">SEPT. 21.</NOTE> over <HI>Yeoman</HI>'s Bridge, near which I enter WESTMORLAND. About four miles farther cross <HI>Clifton</HI> Moor, where the Rebels made a short stand in 1745, and sacrificed a few men to save the rest of their army. Pass over <HI>Shap</HI> Fells, more black, dreary, and melancholy, than any of the High∣land hills, being not only very barren but destitute of every picturesque beauty. This barren scene continued till within a small distance of</P>
<P>KENDAL, a large town on the river <HI>Kent,</HI> in a rich and beautifull vale,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Kendal.</HI></NOTE> well cultivated, and pret∣tily wooded. Here is a very great trade in knit worsted-stockings, some linsies, and a coarse sort of cloth, called cottons, for the <HI>Guinea</HI> trade.</P>
<P>Near <HI>Burton</HI> enter LANCASHIRE. Reach its ca∣pital, <HI>Lancaster,</HI> a large and well-built town, seated on the <HI>Lune,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lancaster.</HI></NOTE> a river navigable for ships of 250 tuns as high as the bridge.

supported by four ionic pillars, on a beautifull plain pediment. There is a double flight of steps, a rustic surbase and coins; a work that does much credit to Mr. <HI>Giller,</HI> the architect, an inhabitant of this town.</P>
<P>The church is seated on an eminence, and com∣mands an extensive but not a pleasing view. The castle is entire, the courts of justice are held in it; and it is also the county jail. The front is very handsome, consists of two large angular towers, with a handsome gateway between.</P>

<HEAD>NUMBER I. Concerning the Constitution of the Church of <HI>Scotland.</HI></HEAD>
<P>PResbyterian government in <HI>Scot∣land</HI> took place after the refor∣mation of popery, as being the form of ecclesiastical government most a∣greeable to the genius and inclina∣tions of the people of <HI>Scotland,</HI> When <HI>James</HI> VI. succeeded to the crown of <HI>England,</HI> it is well known, that du∣ring his reign and that of his succes∣sors of the family of <HI>Stewart,</HI> designs were formed of altering the constitu∣tion of our civil government and ren∣dering our kings more absolute. The establishment of episcopacy in <HI>Scot∣land</HI>
<PB N="222" REF="241"/>
was thought to be one point proper in order to facilitate the exe∣cution of these designs. Episcopacy was accordingly established at length, and continued to be the government of the church till the revolution, when such designs subsisting no lon∣ger, presebyterian government was re∣stored to <HI>Scotland.</HI> It was established by act of parliament in 1690, and was afterwards secured by an express article in the treaty of union between the two kingdoms of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland.</HI> Among the ministers of <HI>Scotland,</HI> there subsists a perfect equality; that is, no minister, con∣sidered as an individual, has an au∣thoratative jurisdiction over another. Jurisdiction is competent for them only when they act in a collective body, or as a court of judicature: and then there is a subordination of
<PB N="223" REF="242"/>
one court to another, or inferiour and superiour courts.</P>
<P>The courts established by law are the four following, <HI>viz.</HI> Church Ses∣sions, Presbyteries, Provincial Synods, and above all a National or General Assembly.</P>
<P>A Church Session is composed of the Minister of the parish and certain discreet Laymen, who are chosen and ordained for the exercise of discipline, and are called Elders. The number of these Elders varies according to the extent of the parish. Two of them, together with the Minister, are necessary, in order to their holding a legal meeting. The Minister always presides in these meetings, and is called Moderator; but has no other authority but what belongs to the <HI>Praeses</HI> of any other court. The
<PB N="224" REF="243"/>
Church Session is appointed for in∣specting the morals of the parishioners, and managing the funds that are ap∣propriated for the maintainance of the poor within their bounds. When a person is convided of any instance of immoral conduct, or of what is in∣consistent with his christian profession, the Church Session inflicts some eccle∣siastical censure, such as giving him an admonition or rebuke: or if the crime be of a gross and publick na∣ture, they appoint him to profess his repentance in face of the whole con∣gregation, in order to make satisfac∣tion for the publick offence. The highest church censure is excommu∣nication, which is seldom inflicted but for contumacy, or for some very atrocious crime obstinately persisted in. In former times there were cer∣tain civil pains and penalties which followed upon a sentence of excom∣munication,
<PB N="225" REF="244"/>
but by a <HI>British</HI> statute these are happily abolished. The church of <HI>Scotland</HI> addresses its cen∣sures only to the consciences of men; and if they cannot by the methods of persuasion reclaim offenders, they think it inconsistent with the spirit of true religion, to have recourse to compulsive methods, such as tempo∣ral pains and penalties.</P>
<P>If the person thinks himself ag∣grieved by the Church Session, it is competent for him to seek redress, by entering an appeal to the Presbytery, which is the next superiour court. In like manner he may appeal from the Presbytery to the Provincial Synod, and from the Synod to the Assembly, whose sentence is final in all ecele∣siastical matters.</P>
<P><PB N="226" REF="245"/>
A Presbytery consists of the, Mini∣sters within a certain district, and also of one ruling Elder from each Church Session within the district. In settling the boundaries of a Presbytery, a re∣gard was paid to the situation of the country. Where the country is po∣pulous and champaign, there are in∣stances of thirty Ministers and as many Elders being joined in one Pres∣bytery. In mountainous countries where travelling is more difficult, there are only seven or eight Ministers, in some places fewer, in a Presbytery. The number of Presbyteries is com∣puted to he about seventy. Presby∣teries review the procedure of Church Sessions, and judge in references and appeals that are brought before them. They take trials of candidates for the ministry: and if upon such trial they had them duly qualified, they license
<PB N="227" REF="246"/>
them to preach, but not to dispense the sacraments. Such licentiates are called Probationers. It is not com∣mon for the church of <HI>Scotland</HI> to or∣dain or confer holy orders on such li∣centiates till they be presented to some vacant kirk, and thereby acquire a right to a benefice.</P>
<P>It is the privilege of Presbyteries to judge their own members, at least in the first instance. They may be judged for herefy, that is, for preach∣ing or publishing doctrines that are contrary to the publick standard im∣posed by Act of Parliament and As∣sembly; or for any instance of im∣moral conduct, prosecutions for heresy were formerly more frequent than they are at present; but happily a more liberal spirit has gained ground among the Clergy of <HI>Scotland.</HI> They think more freely than they did of
<PB N="228" REF="247"/>
old, and consequently a spirit of in∣quiry and moderation seems to be on the growing hand; so that prosecu∣tions for herefy are become more rare, and are generally looked upon as in∣vidious. Some sensible men among the clergy of <HI>Scotland</HI> look upon sub∣scriptions to certain articles and creeds of human composition as a grievance, from which they would willingly be delivered.</P>
<P>Presbyteries are more severe in their censures upon their own members for any instance of immoral conduct. If the person be convicted, they suspend him from the exercise of his ministe∣rial office for a limited time: but if the crime be of a heinous nature, they depose or deprive him of his cle∣rical character; so that he is no lon∣ger a minister of the church of <HI>Scot∣land,</HI> but forfeits his title to his bene∣fice,
<PB N="229" REF="248"/>
and other privileges of the esta∣blished church. However, if the per∣son thinks himself injured by the sentence of the Presbytery, it is law∣ful for him to appeal to the Provin∣cial Synod, within whose bounds his Presbytery lies: and from the Synod he may appeal to the National Assem∣bly. Presbyteries hold their meetings generally every month, except in re∣mote countries, and have a power of adjourning themselves to whatever time or place within their district they shall think proper. They chuse their own <HI>Praeses</HI> or Moderator, who must be a Minister of their own Presbytery. The ruling Elders who sit in Presbyteries must be changed every half-year, or else chosen again by their respective Church Sessions.</P>
<P>Provincial Synods are the next supe∣riour courts to Presbyteries, and are
<PB N="230" REF="249"/>
composed of the several Presbyteries within the province and of a ruling Elder from each Church Session. The ancient dioceses of the Bishops are for the most part the boundaries of a Synod. Most of the Synods in <HI>Scot∣land</HI> meet twice every year, in the months of <HI>April</HI> and <HI>October,</HI> and at every meeting they chuse their Praeses or Moderator, who must be a clergy∣man of their own number. They review the procedure of Presbyteries, and judge in appeals, references and complaints, that are brought before them from the inferiour courts. And if a Presbytery shall be found negli∣gent in executing the ecclesiastical laws against any of their members, or any other person within their juris∣diction, the Synod can call them to account, and censure them as they shall see cause.</P>
<P><PB N="231" REF="250"/>
The General Assembly is the su∣preme court in ecclesiastical matters, and from which there lies no appeal. As they have a power of making Jaws and canons, concerning the discipline and government of the church, and the publick service of religion, the King sends always a commissioner to represent his royal person, that no∣thing may be enacted inconsistent with the laws of the state. The person who represents the King is gene∣rally some <HI>Scots</HI> nobleman, whom his Majesty nominates annually some time before the meeting of the assembly, and is allowed a suitable salary for de∣fraying the expence of this honourable office. He is present at all the meet∣ings of the assembly, and at all their debates and deliberations. After the assembly is constituted, he presents his commission and delivers a speech;
<PB N="232" REF="251"/>
and when they have finished their bu∣siness, which they commonly do in twelve days, he adjourns the assembly, and appoints the time and place of their next annual meeting, which is generally at <HI>Edinburgh</HI> in the month of <HI>May.</HI></P>
<P>The Assembly is composed of Ministers and ruling Elders chosen an∣nually from each Presbytery in <HI>Scot∣land.</HI> As the number of Ministers and Elders in a Presbytery varies, so the number of their representatives must hold a proportion to the number of Ministers and Elders that are in the Presbytery. The proportion is fixed by laws and regulations for that pur∣pose. Each Royal Burgh and Uni∣versity in <HI>Scotland</HI> has likewise the privilege of chusing a ruling Elder to the Assembly. All elections must at least be made forty days before the
<PB N="233" REF="252"/>
meeting of the Assembly. Their ju∣risdiction is either constitutive or ju∣dicial. By the first they have autho∣rity to make laws in ecclesiastical matters: by the other they judge in references and appeals brought be∣fore them from the subordinate courts, and their sentences are decisive and final. One point which greatly employs their attention is the settle∣ment of vacant parishes. The com∣mon people of <HI>Scotland</HI> are greatly prejudiced against the law of pa∣tronage. Hence when a patron pre∣sents a candidate to a vacant parish, the parishioners frequently make great opposition to the settlement of the presentee, and appeal from the infe∣riour courts to the Assembly. The Assembly now-a-days are not disposed to indulge the parishioners in unrea∣sonable opposition to presentees. On the other hand, they are unwilling to
<PB N="234" REF="253"/>
settle the presentee in opposition to the whole people, who refuse to sub∣mit to his ministry, because in this case his ministrations among them must be useless and without effect. The Assembly therefore for the most part delay giving sentence in such cases, till once they have used their endea∣vours to reconcile the parishioners to the presentee. But if their attempts this way prove unsuccessful, they pro∣ceed to settle the presentee in obe∣dience to the act of parliament con∣cerning patronages. Upon the whole it appears that in the indicatories of the church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> there is an equal representation of the Laity as of the Clergy, which is a great secu∣rity to the Laity against the usurpa∣tions of the Clergy.</P>
<P>The business of every Minister in a parish is to perform religious worship,
<PB N="235" REF="254"/>
and to preach in the language of the country to his congregation every <HI>Sunday,</HI> and likewise on other extra∣ordinary occasions appointed by the laws and regulations of the church. The tendency of their preaching is to instruct their hearers in the essential doctrines of natural and revealed re∣ligion, and improve these instructions in order to promote the practice of piety and social virtue. Of old, it was customary to preach upon con∣troverted and mysterious points of divinity, but it is now hoped that the generality of the Clergy confine the subject of their preaching to what has a tendency to promote virtue and good morals, and to make the people peaceable and useful members of so∣ciety.</P>
<P>Ministers likewise examine their parishioners annually. They go to
<PB N="236" REF="255"/>
the different towns and <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I must observe, that Bishop <HI>Burnet</HI> (by birth a <HI>Scotch∣man</HI>) adopted in his diocese the zeal of the church of his native country, and its attention to the morals and good conduct of the clergy and their flocks. Not content with the usual triennial visitations, he every summer, during six weeks, made a progre's through some district of his dio∣cese, preaching and confirming from church to church, so that before the return of the triennial visitation he became well acquainted with the behaviour of every in∣cumbent. He preached every Sunday in some church of the city of <HI>Salisbury;</HI> catechised, and instrncted its youth for confirmation; was most vigilant, and strict in his examination of candidates for holy orders; was an in∣vincible enemy to pluralities, and of course to non∣residents; filled his office with worth and dignity, and by his espiscopal merits, it is to be hoped, may have atoned for the acknowledged blemishes in his biographical cha∣racter.</NOTE> villages of the parish, and in an easy and fami∣liar manner converse with them upon the essential doctrines of religion. They make trial of their knowledge by putting questions to them on these heads. The adult as well as children are catechised. They likewise visit their parishes and inquire into the be∣haviour of their several parishioners, and admonish them for whatever they find blameable in their conduct. At
<PB N="237" REF="256"/>
these visitations the Minister incul∣cates the practice of the relative and social duties, and insists upon the ne∣cessity of the practice of them. And if there happen to be any quarrels among neighbours, the Minister en∣deavours by the power of persuasion to bring about a reconciliation. But in this part of their conduct, much depends upon the temper, prudence, and discretion of Ministers, who are cloathed with the same passions, pre∣judices and infirmities, that other men are:</P>

<P><Q>To apprehend well the present state of <HI>our</HI> church patronage and mode of settlement, we must briefly view this matter from the Reformation. At <HI>that</HI> remarkable period the whole temporalities of the church were resumed by the Crown and Parliament; and soon after a new maintenance was settled for Ministers in about 960 parishes. The patrons of the old, splendid Popish livings, still claimed a pa∣tronage in the new-modelled poor stipends for parish ministers. The Lords, or Gentlemen, who got from the Crown, grants of the superiorities and lands of old <HI>abbies,</HI> claimed also the patronage of all the churches which were in the gift of those

<HI>abbies</HI> during popery. The <HI>King</HI> too claimed the old patronage of the <HI>Crown,</HI> and those of any <HI>ec∣clesiaslic corporations</HI> not granted away.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Lay-patronages were reckoned always a great grievance by the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and accord∣ingly from the beginning of the reformation the Church declared against lay-patronage and presen∣tations. The ecclesiastic laws, of acts of assembly, confirmed at last by parliament, required, in order to the settlement of a Minister, some concurrence of the congre∣gation, of the gentlemen who had property within the cure, and of the elders of the parish.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The Elders, or <HI>Kirk</HI>-Session, are a number of persons, who, for their
<PB N="240" REF="259"/>
wisdom, piety and knowledge, are elected from the body of the people in every parish, and continue for life, <HI>sese bene gerentibus,</HI> to assist the parish Minister in suppressing immoralities and regulating the af∣fairs of the parish. Three of these men and a Minister make a quo∣rum, and form the lowest of our church courts.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Thus matters continued to the year 1649, when by act of parlia∣ment patronages were <HI>abolished</HI> en∣tirely, and the election or nomina∣tion of Ministers was committed to the <HI>Kirk</HI>-Session or Elders; who, in those days of universal sobriety and outward appearance at least of religion among the Presbyteriaris, were generally the gentlemen of il best condition in the parish who were in communion with the
<PB N="241" REF="260"/>
church. After the <HI>restoration</HI> of King <HI>Charles</HI> II. along with epis∣copacy patronages returned, yet under the old laws; and all de∣bates were finally determinate by the <HI>General Assembly,</HI> which even under episcopacy in <HI>Scotland</HI> was the supreme ecclesiastic court. Thus they continued till the Re∣volution, when the Presbyterian model was restored by act of par∣liament.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The people chose their own mi∣nisters, and matters continued in this form till the year 1711, when Queen <HI>Anne</HI>'s ministry intending to defeat the <HI>Hanover</HI> successon, took all methods to harass such as were firmly attached to it, which the Presbyterian Gentry and Clergy ever were, both from principle and inte∣rest. An act therefore was obtained,
<PB N="242" REF="261"/>
and which is still in force, restoring patrons to their power of electing ministers.</Q></P>
<P><Q>By this act the King is now in possession of the patronage of above 500 churches out of 950, having not only the old rights of the crown, but many patronages ac∣quired at the reformation not yet alienated; all the patronages of the 14 <HI>Scots</HI> Bishops, and all the patronages of the Lords and Gen∣tlemen forseited in the years 1715 and 1745. Lords, gentlemen and magistrates of burroughs, are the patrons of the remaining churches. A patron must present a qualified person to a charge within six months of the last incumbent's re∣moval or death, otherwise his right falls to the Presbytery.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="243" REF="262"/>
<Q>A Presbytery consists of several Ministers and Elders, All parishes are annexed to some Presbytery. The Presbytery is the second church court, and they revise the the acts of the <HI>Kirk</HI>-Session, which is the lowest. Above the Presby∣tery is the Synod, which is a court consisting of several Presbyteries. And from all these there lies an appeal to the General Assembly, which is the supreme church court in <HI>Scotland.</HI> This supreme court consists of the King represented by his Commissioner, Ministers from the different Presbyteries, and ruling Elders. They meet an∣nually at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> enact laws for the good of the church, finally determine all controverted elections of Ministers. They can prevent a clergyman's transportation from one
<PB N="244" REF="263"/>
charge to another. They can find a presentee qualified or unqualified, and consequently oblige the patron to present another. They can de∣pose from the ministry, and every intrant into holy orders becomes bound to submit to the decisions of this court; which, from the days our reformer <HI>John Knox,</HI> has ap∣propriated to itself the titles of The VERY VENERABLE and VERY REVEREND ASSEMBLY of the Church of <HI>Scotland.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>All the clergymen of our com∣munion are upon a par as to autho∣rity. We can enjoy no pluralities. Non-residence is not known. We are bound to a regular discharge of the several duties of our office. The different cures are frequently visited by the Presbytery of the bounds; and at these visitations strict: en∣quiry
<PB N="245" REF="264"/>
is made into the life, doc∣trine and diligence of the incum∣bent. And for default in any of these, he may be suspended from preaching: or if any gross immo∣rality is proved against him, he can be immediately deposed and ren∣dered incapable of officiating as a Minister of the gospel. Appeal indeed lies, as I said before, from the decision of the inferior to the supreme court.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Great care is taken in preparing young men for the ministry. After going through a course of philo∣sophy in one of our four Universi∣ties, they must attend at least for four years the Divinity-Hall, where they hear the prelections of the professors, and perform the dif∣ferent exercises prescribed them: they must attend the Greek, the
<PB N="246" REF="265"/>
Hebrew, and Rhetoric classes; and before ever they are admitted to tryals for the ministry before a Pres∣bytery, they must lay testimonials from the different professors of their mortis, their attendance, their pro∣gress, before them: and if upon tryal they are found unqualified, they are either set aside as unfit for the office, or enjoined to apply to their studies a year or two more.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Our livings are in general from 60 to 120l. sterling. Some few livings are richer, and a few poorer. Every minister besides is entitled to a mansion-house, barn and stable; to four acres of arable and three of pasturage land. Our livings are exempted from all public duties; as are also our persons from all public statute-works. As schools are erected in all our parishes, and
<PB N="247" REF="266"/>
that education is cheap, our young generation is beginning to imbibe some degree of taste and liberal sentiment unknown to their illite∣rate rude forefathers. The English language is cultivated even here amongst <HI>these</HI> bleak and dreary mountains. <HI>Your</HI> Divines, <HI>your</HI> Philosophers, <HI>your</HI> Historians, <HI>your</HI> Poets, have found their way to our sequestred vales, and are perused with pleasure even by our lowly swains; and the names of <HI>Tittotson,</HI> of <HI>Atterbury,</HI> of <HI>Clerk,</HI> of <HI>Secker,</HI> of <HI>Newton,</HI> of <HI>Locke,</HI> of <HI>Bacon,</HI> of <HI>Lyttelton,</HI> of <HI>Dryden,</HI> of <HI>Pope,</HI> of <HI>Gay,</HI> and of <HI>Gray,</HI> are not unknown in our distant land.</Q></P>

<HEAD>NUMBER II. Account of the fading Woman of <HI>Rosshire.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Dunrobin,</HI> <DATE><HI>Aug.</HI> 24, 1769.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>The Information of Mr. <HI>Rainy,</HI> Mis∣sionary—Minister in <HI>Kincardine,</HI> anent <HI>Katharine M'Leod.</HI></P>
<P><HI>KAtharine M'Leod,</HI> daughter to <HI>Do∣nald M'Leod,</HI> farmer in <HI>Croig,</HI> in the parish of <HI>Kincardine, Rosshire,</HI> an unmarried woman, aged about thirty∣five years, sixteen years ago contracted a fever, after which she became blind. Her father carried her to several phy∣sicians and surgeons to cure her blind∣ness. Their prescriptions proved of no effect. He carried her also to a lady skilled in physic, in the neigh∣borhood,
<PB N="249" REF="268"/>
who, doubtfull whether her blindness was occasioned by the weak∣ness of her eye-lids, or a defect in her eyes, found by the use of some medi∣cines that the blindness was occasioned by a weakness in her eye-lids, which being strengthened she recovered her fight in some measure, and discharged as usual every kind of work about her father's farm; but tyed a garter tight round her forehead to keep up her eye-lids. In this condition she con∣tinued for four or five years, enjoying a good state of health, and working as usual. She contracted another lin∣gering fever, of which she never re∣covered perfectly.</P>
<P>Some time after her fever her jaws fell, her eye-lids closed, and she lost her appetite. Her parents declare that for the space of a year and three-quarters they could not say that any meat or liquid went down her throat.
<PB N="250" REF="269"/>
throat. Being interrogated on this point, they own'd they very fre∣quently put something into her mouth. But they concluded that nothing went down her throat, because she had no evacuation; and when they forced open her jaws at one time, and kept them open for some time by putting in a stick between her teeth, and pulled forward her tongue, and forced something down her throat, me coughed and strained, as if in danger to be choaked. One thing during the time she eat and drank nothing is remarkable, that her jaws were unlocked, and she recovered her speech, and retained it for several days, without any apparent cause for the same; she was quite sensible, re∣peated several questions of the shorter catechisms; told them that it was to no purpose to put any thing into her mouth, for that nothing went down
<PB N="251" REF="270"/>
her throat; as also that sometimes she understood them when they spoke to her. By degrees her jaws thereafter fell, and she lost her speech.</P>
<P>Some time before I few her she re∣ceived some sustenance, whey, water∣gruel, &amp;c. but threw it up, at least for the most part, immediately. When they put the stick between her teeth, mentioned above, two or three of her teeth were broken. It was at this breach they put in any thing into her mouth. I caused them to bring her out of bed, and give her something to drink. They gave her whey. Her neck was contraded, her chin fixed on her breast, nor could by any force be pulled back: she put her chin and mouth into the dish with the whey, and I perceived she sucked it at the above-mentioned breach as a child would suck the breast, and imme∣diately
<PB N="252" REF="271"/>
threw it up again, as her pa∣rents told me she used to do, and she endeavoured with her hand to dry her mouth and chin. Her forehead was contracted and wrinkled; her cheeks full, red, and blooming. Her parents told me that she slept a great deal and soundly, perspired sometimes, and now and then emitted pretty large quantities of blood at her mouth.</P>
<P>For about two years past they have been wont to carry her to the door once every day, and she would shew signs of uneasiness when they neg∣lected it at the usual time. Last sum-summer, after giving her to drink of the water of the weil of <HI>Strathconnen,</HI> she crawled to the door on her hands and feet without any help. She is at present in a very languid way, and still throws up what she drinks.</P>

<HEAD>NUMBER III. Parallel Roads in <HI>Glen-Roy.</HI></HEAD>
<P>ALL the description that can be given of the Parallel Roads, or Terrasses, is, that the Glen of itself is extremely narrow, and the hills on each side very high, and generally not rocky. In the face of these hills, both sides of the glen, there are three roads at small distances from each other, and directly opposite on each side. These roads have been mea∣sured in the compleatest parts of them, and found to be 26 paces of a man five feet ten inches high. The two highest are pretty near each other, about 50 yards, and the lowest double that distance from the nearest to it. They are carried along the sides of the glen with the utmost regularity,
<PB N="254" REF="273"/>
nearly as exact as drawn with a line of rule and compass.</P>
<P>Where deep burns or gullies of wa∣ter cross these roads, they avoid both the descent and ascent in a very cu∣rious manner; so that on the side where the road enters those hollows, they rather ascend along the slope, and descend the opposite side until they come to the level, without the traveller being sensible of ascent or descent. There are other smaller glens falling into this <HI>Glen-Roy.</HI> The parallel roads surround all these smaller ones; but where <HI>Glen-Roy</HI> ends in the open country there are not the smallest vestiges of them to be seen. The length of these roads in <HI>Glen-Roy</HI> are about seven miles. There are other two glens in that neighbour∣hood where these roads are equally visible, called <HI>Glen-Gluy</HI> and <HI>Glen-Spean,</HI>
<PB N="255" REF="274"/>
the former running north-west and the latter south from <HI>Glen-Roy,</HI> Both these roads are much about the same length as <HI>Glen-Roy.</HI></P>
<P>It is to be observed that these roads are not causeway, but levelled out of the earth. There are some small rocks, though few, in the course of these roads. People have examined in what manner they made this passage through the rocks, and find no vestige of roads in the rock; but they begin on each side, and keep the regular line as formerly. So far I am indebted to Mr. <HI>Trapaud,</HI> Governor of <HI>Fort Au∣gustus.</HI></P>
<P>I cannot learn to what nation the inhabitants of the country attribute these roads: I was informed that they were inaccessible at the east end, open at the west, or that nearest to the sea,
<PB N="256" REF="275"/>
and that there were no traces of build∣ings, or <HI>druidical</HI> remains, in any part, that could lead us to suspect that they were designed for oeconomi∣cal or religious purposes. The coun∣try people think they were designed for the chace, and that these terrasses were made after the spots were cleared in lines from wood, in order to tempt the animals into the open paths after they were rouzed, in order that they might come within reach of the bow∣men, who might conceal themselves in the woods above and below. Ridings for the sportsmen are still common in all great forests in <HI>France,</HI> and other countries on the continent, either that they might pursue the game without interruption of trees, or shoot at it in its passage.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Gordon,</HI> p. 114, of his Itine∣rary, mentions such terrasses, to the
<PB N="257" REF="276"/>
number of seventeen or eighteen, raised one above the other in the most regu∣lar manner, for the space of a mile, on the side of a hill, in the county of <HI>Tweedale,</HI> near a village called <HI>Romana,</HI> and also near two small <HI>Roman</HI> camps. They are from fifteen to twenty feet broad, and appear at four or five miles distance not unlike a great am∣phitheatre. The same gentleman also has observed similar terrasses near other camps of the same nation, from whence he suspects them to be works of the <HI>Romans,</HI> and to have been thrown up by their armies for itinerary en∣campments. Such may have been their use in those places: but what could have been the object of the contrivers of the terrasses of <HI>Glen-Roy,</HI> where it is more than probable those conquerors never came, remains a mystery, except the conjecture above given should prove satisfactory.</P>

One was com∣municated to me by the Rev. Mr. <HI>Farish</HI> of <HI>Carlisle,</HI> and represents them in their present state; the other by the Rev. Mr. <HI>Monkhouse,</HI> Fellow of <HI>Queen's College, Oxford,</HI> which is a view of them before they were muti∣lated. The first is certainly a most authentic representation of them; the last varies in many particulars from the form they now appear in: in that
<PB N="268" REF="287"/>
the columns are drawn entirely square from top to bottom, whereas the lower part of the pillars now extant are rounded. There is no fret-work on the old drawing of these columns, but instead are two small rude figures of human heads. The thin semicircular stones are deeply and regularly in∣dented on their edges, which appear of an equal thickness throughout; whereas the others are very sharp, or ridged at one extremity, and dilate gradually till they arrive at a consi∣derable thickness at the other. The figures in the old sketch are of a boar, and perhaps a bear. The upper ends of these pillars seem faithfully to sup∣ply what has been destroyed, a cross and a capital.</P>
<P>How this great variation in the drawings of the same columns hap∣pened, is not easy to say; for it does
<PB N="269" REF="288"/>
not appear that there ever were any others in the place. Time has obli∣terated the figures of the animals but whether any workman had chiz∣zled the whole shafts of the pillars to their present form, is, I think, scarcely to be conjectured; they bear all the appearance of antiquity. The old drawings are done with much ele∣gance, and are copied from some col∣lections in the custody of Mr. <HI>Monk∣house,</HI> formed by <HI>Hugh Todd,</HI> D. D. Prebendary of <HI>Carlisle</HI> and Vicar of <HI>Penrith,</HI> as materials for the antiqui∣ties of the diocese he belonged to. Notwithstanding my doubts about the entire fidelity of the old drawing, (which was done about the year 1690) I cause it to be engraven as a com∣panion to the other, in hopes that some antiquarian of the country will oblige the Publick by clearing up the point.</P>
<P><PB N="270" REF="289"/>
By Mr. <HI>Monkhouse</HI>'s permission I annex Doctor <HI>Todd</HI>'s account of these antiquities:</P>
<P><Q>At the north door of the church are erected two large stone pillars of a pyramidical form, cruciated towards the top, each of them fif∣teen feet high, and plac'd at the distance of seventeen feet from each other. The space between them is surrounded with the rude figures of four boars, or wild hogs. What this monument denotes, and for what reason it was first erected, may be somewhat uncertain. The common vulgar report is, That one <HI>Ewen</HI> or <HI>Owen Coesarius,</HI> a very ex∣traordinary person, famous in these parts for hunting and fighting, about 1400 years ago, whom no hand but the hand of Death could
<PB N="271" REF="290"/>
overcome, lyes buried in this place. His stature, as the story lays, was prodigious, beyond that of the <HI>Patagons</HI> in <HI>South America,</HI> viz. fifteen feet. That the two pillars denote his height, and the four ough unpolish'd stones betwixt re∣present so many wild boars which had the honour to be kill'd by this wonderful giant. That there might be, in remote times, in these re∣gions, men of large gi gantick fi∣gures, as there are now near the <HI>Magellanic</HI> Streights, and that they might affect <HI>Roman</HI> sirnames and distinctions as the <HI>Americans</HI> about <HI>Darieen</HI> do <HI>Spanish,</HI> needs not either be discussed or denied. But those persons give the best account of the original, nature, and design of these stones, who look upon them as of a much later date, and for a very different intention. That they were
<PB N="272" REF="291"/>
erected long after the introduction of christianity at the north (or Death's) door of the church in the form of a cross, in order to rest the bodies of the dead upon them, and to pray for their souls (as the man∣ner was): And that the four figures of Boars are the cognizance<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Bear and ragged-staff was; but I do not recollect that the Boars had any thing to do with the Earls of <HI>War∣wick:</HI> But as Boars and Bears are represented on the stones, it seems as if this Mr. <HI>Caesarius</HI> was a knight∣errant, who cleared the country of monsters; so in me∣morial of his exploits these figures were engraven. The heads too might have been cut on the columns in memory of some petty tyrants of the neighborhood whom he had demolished; for such bloody trophies were in former days very common; witness, among the <HI>Welsh,</HI> the <HI>Tripen Sais,</HI> or three Englishmen's heads, borne in the arms of many of our families, as a token of the prowess of their an∣cesters.</NOTE> of the Earls of <HI>Warwick,</HI> some of whom held the seigniory of <HI>Penrith</HI> and lived in the castle, and might be at the expence of the work.</Q></P>

<P>A full-grown Roe weighs 60lb. the hair in summer is short, smooth, and glossy, red at the tips, cinereous beneath. At approach of winter the hair grows very long and hoary, and proves an excellent defence against the rigor of the highland air. The rump and underside of the tail white. The tail very short. Below the first joint of the outside of the hind leg is a long tuft of hair, such as is found on the legs of certain Antelopes. The
<PB N="274" REF="294"/>
horns of a Roebuck of the second year are strait, slender, and without any branch: in the third become bi∣furcated: in the fourth, trifurcated, and grow more scabrous and stronger, in proportion to their longevity. It feeds during summer on grass, and is remarkably fond of the <HI>Rubas Saxatilis,</HI> called in the Highlands on that ac∣count the Roebuck Berry. When the ground is covered with snow it feeds on the extreme branches of the pine and juniper. It brings two young at a time. The Fawns are elegantly spotted with white. It is extremely difficult to rear them; commonly eight out of ten dying in the attempt. The flesh of the Roe is by some accounted a delicacy: to me it seemed very dry. They keep in small families of five or six.</P>
