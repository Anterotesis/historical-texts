<P>THE POETICAL WORKS OF MARK AKENSIDE.</P>
<P>IN TWO VOLUMES.</P>
<P>WITH THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.</P>
<Q><L>Genius of ancient Greece! whose faithful steps</L>
<L>Have led us to these awful solitudes</L>
<L>Of Nature and of Science; Nurse rever'd</L>
<L>Of gen'rous counsels and heroick deeds!</L>
<L>O let some portion of thy matchless praise</L>
<L>Dwell in my breast, and teach me to adorn</L>
<L>This unattempted theme!—Let me</L>
<L>With blameless hand from thy unenvious fields</L>
<L>Transplant some living blossoms to adorn</L>
<L>My native clime—while to my compatriot youth</L>
<L>I point the great example of thy sons.</L>
<L>And tune to Attick themes the British lyre.</L>
<BIBL>PLEAS. OF IMAG. ENLARCED</BIBL></Q>
<Q><L>Come, AKENSIDE! come with thine Attick urn,</L>
<L>Fill'd from Ilissus by the Naiad's hand:</L>
<L>Thy harp was tun'd to Freedom—Strains like thine,</L>
<L>When Asia's lord bor'd the huge mountain's side</L>
<L>And bridg'd the sea, to battle rous'd the tribes</L>
<L>Of ancient Creece.—</L>

<P>VOL. II.</P>
<P>CONTAINING HIS ODES, MISCELLANIES, HYMNS, INSCRIPTIONS, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</HI></P>
<Q><L>With what enchantment Nature's goodly scene</L>
<L>Attracts the sense of mortals; how the mind</L>
<L>For its own eye doth objects nobler still</L>
<L>Prepare; how men by various lessons learn</L>
<L>To judge of Beauty's praise; what raptures fill</L>
<L>The breast with Fancy's native arts endow'd,</L>
<L>And what true culture guides it to renown,</L>
<L>My Verse unfolds. Ye Gods or godlike Pow'rs!</L>
<L>Ye Guardians of the sacred task! attend</L>
<L>Propitious: hand in hand around your Bard</L>
<L>Move in majestick measures.—Be great in him,</L>
<L>And let your favour make him wise to speak</L>
<L>Of all your wondrous empire, with a voice</L>
<L>So temper'd to his theme that those who hear</L>
<L>May yield perpetual homage to yourselves.—</L>
<L>O! attend, whoe'er thou art whom th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se delights can touch,</L>
<L>Whom Nature's aspect, Nature's simple garb,</L>
<L>Can thus command: O! listen to my Song,</L>
<L>And I will guide thee to her blissful walks,</L>
<L>And teach thy solitude her voice to hea,</L>
<L>And point her gracious features to thy view.</L>

Diodorus Siculus has preserved the inscription which the Athenians affixed to the consecrated spoils after this great success, in which it is very remarkable that the greatness of the occasion has raised the manner of expression above the usual simplicity and modesty of all other ancient inscriptions.

<HEAD>II. 3.<NOTE PLACE="foot"><HI>Stanza</HI> II. 3.] Pindar was contemporary with Aristides and Cimon, in whom the glory of ancient Greece was at its height. When Xerxes invaded Greece Pindar was true to the com∣mon interest of his country, though his fellow-citizens the Thebans had sold themselves to the Persian king. In one of his odes he expresses the great distress and anxiety of his mind occasioned by the vast preparations of Xerxes against Greece, <BIBL>(<HI>Isthm.</HI> viii.)</BIBL> in another he celebrates the victories of Sala∣mis, Plataea, and Himera, <BIBL>(<HI>Pyth.</HI> i.)</BIBL> It will be necessary to add two or three other particulars of his life, real or fabulous, in order to explain what follows in the text concerning him. First, then, he was thought to be so great a favourite of Apollo that the priests of that deity allotted him a constant share of their offerings. It was said of him as of some other illustrious men, that at his birth a swarm of bees lighted on his lips and fed him with their honey: it was also a tradition concerning him that Pan was heard to recite his poetry, and seen dancing to one of his hymns on the mountains near Thebes. But a real historical fact in his life is, that the Thebans imposed a large fine upon him on account of the veneration which he express∣ed in his poems for that heroick spirit shewn by the people of Athens in defence of the common liberty which his own fel∣low-citizens had shamefully betrayed; and as the argument of this ode implies that great poetical talents and high sen∣timents of liberty do reciprocaily produce and assist each other, so Pindar is perhaps the most exemplary proof of this connexion which occurs in history. The Thebans were re∣markable in general for a slavish disposition through all the for∣tunes of their commonwealth at the time of its ruin by Philip, and even in its best state under the administration of Pelo∣pidas and Epaminondas; and every one knows they were no less remarkable for great dulness and want of all genius. That Pindar should have equally distinguished himself from the rest of his fellow-citizens in both these respects seems somewhat ex∣traordinary, and is scarce to be accounted for but by the pre∣ceding observation.</NOTE></HEAD>

<HEAD>AN EPISTLE TO CURIO<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Curio was a young Roman Senator of distinguished rank and parts. Being profusely extravagant he soon dissipated a splendid fortune, to supply the want of which he entered into the designs of Caesar against the liberties of his country, altho' he had formerly been a professed enemy to him. Cicero, to whose care he had been committed upon his first entrance in∣to the Forum, exerted himself to prevent his ruin, but without effect, and he became one of the first victims in the Civil war. This Epistle was first published in the 1744, when a celebra∣ted patriot was supposed to have deserted the cause of his coun∣try. The Author afterwards transformed it into the Ode to Curio, <Q REND="inline">"a performance disgraceful only to its Author,"</Q> says a celebrated writer. The Epistle, which is too curious to be omitted, we here give in its original form. The Ode is printed p. 31. of this volume.</NOTE>.</HEAD>

<L N="25">Were Love and Chaos; Love the fire of Fate,<NOTE PLACE="foot"><P>℣. 25. <HI>—Love—Elder than Chaos.</HI>] Hesiod in his Theo∣gony gives a different account, and makes Chaos the eldest of beings, though he assigns to Love neither father nor superiour, which circumstance is particularly mentioned by Phaedrus in Plato's Banquet as being observable not only in Hesiod but in all other writers both of verse and prose, and on the same occasion he cites a line from Parmenides, in which Love is ex∣pressly styled the eldest of all the gods. Yet Aristophanes, in The Birds, affirms that <Q REND="inline">"Chaos and Night, and Erebus and Tartarus, were first, and that Love was produced from an egg which the sable-winged Night deposited in the immense bosom of Erebus."</Q> But it must be observed that the Love designed by this comick poet was always distinguished from the other, from that original and selfexistent being the ΤΟ ΟΝ or ΑΓΑΘΟΝ of Plato, and meant only the ΔΗΜΙΟΥΡΓΟΣ or second person of the old Grecian trinity, to whom is in∣scribed an hymn among those which pass under the name of Orpheus, where he is called Protogonos, or the First-begotten, is said to have been born of an egg, and is represented as the principal or origin of all these external appearances of Nature. In the Fragments of Orpheus collected by Henry Stephens he is named Phanes, the Discoverer or Discloser, who unfolded the ideas of the Supreme Intelligence, and exposed them to the perception of inferiour beings in this visible frame of the world, as Mocrobius, and Proclus, and Athenagoras, all agree to interpret the several passages of Orpheus which they have preserved.</P>
<P>But the Love designed in our text is the one selfexistent and Infinite Mind, whom if the generality of ancient mythologists have not introduced or truly described in accounting for the production of the world and its appearances, yet to a modern poet it can be no objection that he hath ventured to differ from them in this particular, though in other respects he pro∣fesseth to imitate their manner and conform to their opinions; for in these great points of natural theology they differ no less remarkably among themselves, and are perpetually confound∣ing the philosophical relations of things with the traditionary circumstances of mythick history; upon which very account Callimachus in his Hymn to Jupiter declareth his dissent from them concerning even an article of the national creed, adding that the ancient bards were by no means to be de∣pended on. And yet in the exordium of the old Argonautick poem ascribed to Orpheus it is said that <Q REND="inline">"Love, whom mor∣tals in later times call Phanes, was the father of the eter∣nally begotten Night,"</Q> who is generally represented by these mytholOgical poets as being herself the parent of all things and who in The Indigitamenta, or Orphick Hymns, is said to be the same with Cypris, or Love itself. Moreover, in the body of this Argonautick poem, where the personated Or∣pheus introduceth himself singing to his lyre in reply to Chi∣ron, he celebrateth <Q REND="inline">"the obscure memory of Chaos, and the natures which it contained within itself in a state of perpetual vicissitude; how the heaven had its boundary determined, the generation of the earth, the depth of the ocean, and also the sapient Love, the most ancient, the self-sufficient, with all the beings which he produced when he separated one thing from another:"</Q> which noble passage is more directly to Ari∣stotle's purpose in the first book of his Metaphysicks than any of those which he has there quoted to shew that the ancient poets and mythologists agreed with Empedocles, Anaxagoras, and the other more sober philosophers, in that natural antici∣pation and common notion of mankind concerning the neces∣sity of mind and reason to account for the connexion, motion, and good order of the world. For though neither this poem nor the hymns which pass under the same name are, it should seem, the work of the real Orpheus, yet beyond all question they are very ancient. The hymns more particularly are allowed to be older than the invasion of Greece by Xerxes, and were pro∣bably a set of publick and solemn forms of devotion, as appears by a passage in one of them, which Demosthenes hath almost li∣terally cited in his first oration against Aristogiton, as the saying of Orpheus, the founder of their most holy mysteries. On this account they are of higher authority than any other mytholo∣gical work now extant, the Theogony of Hesiod himself not excepted. The poetry of them is often extremely noble, and the mysterious air which prevails in them, together with its delightful impression upon the mind, cannot be better express∣ed than in that remarkable description with which they inspi∣red the German editor Eschenbach when he accidentally met with them at Leipsick: <Q REND="inline">"Thesaurum me reperisse credidi,"</Q> says he, <Q REND="inline">"et prosecto thesaurum reperi. Incredibile dictu quo me sacro horrore afflaverint indigitamenta ista deorum: nam et tempus ad illorum lectionem eligere cogebar, quod vel so∣lum horrorem incutere animo potest, nocturnum; cum enim totam diem consumserim in contemplando urbis splendore, et in adeundis, quibus scatet urbs illa, viris doctis; sola nox restabat, quam Orpheo consecrare potui.

<Q><L>"The womb of Nature."</L></Q></NOTE><NOTE PLACE="foot"><HI>Ibid. Love the sire of Fate.</HI>] Fate is the universal system of na∣tural causes, the work of the Omnipotent Mind or of Love; so Minucius Felix: <Q REND="inline">"Quid enim aliud eft fatum, quam quod de unoquoque nostrum deus fatus est."</Q> So also Cicero, in the first Book on Divination; <Q REND="inline">"Fatum autem id appello, quod Graeci ΕΙΡΜΑΡΜΕΝΗΝ; id est, ordinem seriemque causarum, cum causa causae nexa rem ex se gignat—ex quo intelligitur, ut fatum sit non id quod superstitiose, sed id quod physice dici∣tur causa aeterna rerum."</Q> To the same purpose is the doc∣trine of Hierocles in that excellent fragment concerning Pro∣vidence and Destiny. As to the three Fates or Destinies of the poets, they represented that part of the general system of natu∣ral causes which relate to man and to other mortal beings, for so we are told in the hymn addressed to them among the Orphick Indigitamenta, where they are called the daughters of Night (or Love) and contrary to the vulgar notion are distin∣guished by the epithets of Gentle and Tenderhearted. Accord∣ing to <BIBL>Hesiod, <HI>Theog.</HI> ver. 904,</BIBL> they were the daughters of Ju∣piter and Themis, but in the Orphick Hymn to Venus or Love that goddess is directly styled the mother of Necessity, and is represented immediately after as governing the three Destinies, and conducting the whole system of Natural causes.</NOTE></L>

Virgil in the eighth book of the Aeneid speaks as if the Nymphs or Naiads were the pa∣rents of the rivers, but in this he contradicts the testimony of Hesiod, and evidently departs from the orthodox system which representeth several nymphs as retaining to every single river. On the other hand Callimachus, who was very learned in all the school-divinity of those times, in his Hymn to Delos maketh Peneus the great Thessalian river-godthe father of his nymphs; and Ovid, in the fourteenth book of his Metamorphoses, men∣tions the Naiads of Latium as the immediate daughters of the neighbouring river-gods. Accordingly the Naiads of particular rivers are occasionally both by Ovid and Statius called by a pa∣tronymick, from the name of the river to which they belong.</NOTE></L>

On this account he was induced to at∣tempt somewhat in the same manner, solely by way of exer∣cise, the manner itself being now almost entirely abandoned in poetry: and as the mere genealogy or the personal adven∣tures of Heathen gods could have been but little interesting to a modern reader, it was therefore thought proper to select some convenient part of the history of Nature, and to employ these ancient divinities as it is probable they were first employ∣ed, to wit, in personifying natural causes, and in representing the mutual agreement or opposition of the corporeal and mo∣ral powers of the world, which hath been accounted the very highest office of poetry.</NOTE></L>
