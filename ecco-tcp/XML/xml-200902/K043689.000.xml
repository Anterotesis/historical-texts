<SPEAKER>ELIZA.</SPEAKER>
<P>After passing two tedious days in that gloomy forest, how delightful is the open air! This change of prospect—Oh, Liffey! can that be the prison of my husband?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LIFFEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is; that is Ramah Droog Fortress; that is my master Captain Sidney's prison. Oh! I shall never forget this valley. Here our detachment was surrounded—here some brave fellows fell, and all the rest were taken prisoners—except myself—No, no—I was not amongst the slain; nor was I taken prisoner. Oh! I shall never forget how the black rascals came pouring down upon us on every side, when my master turned to me sud∣denly: <Q REND="inline">"Liffey,"</Q> said he, <Q REND="inline">"all is lost—Make your escape as fast as possible—Run away with my wife, I entreat you."</Q> And then you know, ma'am—</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>ELIZA.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know not what passed! At the sight of my Sid∣ney's danger, my boasted courage forsook me.</P>

<P><Q REND="inline">"Run away, Sir!"</Q> cried I. <Q REND="inline">"Alas! poor Liffey never disobeyed your orders before; but it is impossible to run away—Upon my soul, I can't turn my back upon an enemy—I can't muster up courage to do it."</Q></P>

<SPEAKER>LIFFEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is my only consolation for behaving like a coward. <Q REND="inline">"Leave me, my good fellow, if you have any friendship for me,"</Q> said he. By my honor, thought I, that seems to be an odd way of shewing friendship, (though not unusual,) to desert a friend when he stands most in need of assistance.</P>

<P>Who are those men armed with spears and javelins?</P>

<P>Your fidelity entitles you to my attention. What would you propose?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LIFFEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, look ye, madam! We are two hundred miles from the British settlement; and our whole stock of provisions is one poor little solitary potatoe, in the corner of my knapsack.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ELIZA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Good heavens! Liffey, did you not tell me that you had rice enough for a week?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LIFFEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>So I thought till I looked into the bag just now; and i'faith, I find, instead of a bag of rice, I had in my hurry carried off a full suit of clothes belong∣ing to old Sampan, our commissary's clerk.</P>

<L>When I was a mighty smart boy,</L>
<L>Young Margery came to our town, Sir;</L>
<L>Oh! how I was bother'd with joy!</L>
<L>Like a kitten I frisk'd up and down, Sir;</L>
<L>Calling her my sweet pearl, and following after behind her,</L>
<L>For her black eyes no girl could match my sweet Margery Grinder.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>My mother in vain bade me work,</L>
<L>Nor work, eat, or sleep, could poor Barney,</L>
<L>So she went to old Father O'Rourke,</L>
<L>Told her story, and after some blarney—</L>
<L>"Give me advice," says she; "No friend than you can be kinder."</L>
<L>Father O'Rourke a sheep's eye had himself cast on Margery Grinder.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What devil has got in the place,</L>
<L>The folks are all mad, cries my mother;</L>
<L>For there's Captain Dermot M'Shean,</L>
<L>And that deaf lawyer Patrick his brother,</L>
<L>Thedy the purblind beau, and old O'Donovan blinder,</L>
<L>They're dancing or hobbling all, after pert little Margery Grinder.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>This Father O'Rourke gravely heard,</L>
<L>For grave was the Father though frisky—</L>
<L>Mrs. Liffey, says he, take my word,</L>
<L>(But he first took a noggin of whiskey,)</L>
<L>"Barney will have the girl, catch her where'er he can find her;"</L>
<L>So, by his advice I was married next day to sweet Margery Grinder.</L>
