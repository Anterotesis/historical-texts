<HEAD>CURIOSITIES In the <HI>Tower</HI> of <HI>London.</HI></HEAD>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="book">
<HEAD>BOOK III.</HEAD>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. I.</HI> Of the small Armoury.</HEAD>
<P>THE building itself, called the <HI>new Ar∣moury,</HI> where these arms
<PB N="20" REF="18"/>are laid up, is a most no∣ble and magnificent struc∣ture. It stands north of the White Tower, and ex∣tends in length about a hundred and thirty yards, in depth about twenty. It was begun in the reign of king James the second, and finished in king William's.</P>
<P>You go in at the west end of this grand build∣ing, behind the chapel, and ascend a spacious and lofty
<PB N="21" REF="19"/>stair-case, at the head of which you turn to your right hand, and entering the room before you, you will see one of the greatest, curiosities, in its kind, ever formed by the art of man: Here are arms, we are told, sufficient for a hundred thousand men at a minute's warning, laid up in a most surprizing artificial order and beauty, all bright and clean to admiration.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="20"/>Just within the door, on the left hand, are, first, two lofty beatiful pyramids of pistols, standing upon the crown, globe and sceptre, in curious carved work.</P>
<P>The second is called a wilderness of arms; that is, pikes, carbines, muskets, bayonets, halberts, swords, pistols, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> so laid up, that you have a prospect through all their ranges to the farther end of the
<PB N="23" REF="21"/>room, which is three hun∣dred and forty-five feet long; the sight of which is enough to strike one with wonder and amaze∣ment.</P>
<P>The third is a figure of arms taken at the Bath in the last rebellion in the year 1715.</P>
<P>Fourth, is the form of the waves of the sea, made with swords.</P>
<P>Fifth, represents half-moons
<PB N="24" REF="22"/>and fans, made with pistols and bayonets; and the form of a target in the middle made with bayo∣net blades.</P>
<P>Sixth, two pillars of pikes, in imitation of flut∣ed work, with fine carved capitals, of the Corinthian order.</P>
<P>Seventh, a pillar made of pikes and swords, for the sea service.</P>
<P>Eighth, are blunderbus∣ses
<PB N="25" REF="23"/>in the form of pillars, with capitals of pistols all the way up; and on both sides bayonets in the form of the waves of the sea.</P>
<P>Ninth, carbines for the horse service, and marine hangers set in checquer-work.</P>
<P>Tenth, carbines for the horse, lined with pikes.</P>
<P>Eleventh, are swords and bayonets in the form of half-moons and fans, set
<PB N="26" REF="24"/>upon scollop-shells of fine carved work.</P>
<P>Twelfth, is the sun ris∣ing, represented in a square frame, guarded with ma∣rine hangers; and opposite to that, in the middle of the room, are four beauti∣ful twisted pillars, made with pistols up to the top, which is about twenty two feet, the heighth of the room: and in the centre of these pillars, is the
<PB N="27" REF="25"/>form of a dropping star, made of pistols; upon the left is the form of the sun setting, made answerable to that of its rising.</P>
<P>Thirteenth, represents the form of a pair of gates, made with serjeants hal∣berts.</P>
<P>Fourteenth, are carbines hanging in surbelows and flounces.</P>
<P>Fifteenth, is the form of a whale's backbone, made with carbines.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="26"/>Sixteenth, represents the grand witch of Endor, cal∣led likewise Envy, or Me∣dusa's head; with the fi∣gures of snakes stinging her to death, made with three rows of pistols, set with curious art; the features are of fine carved work.</P>
<P>Seventeenth, at the far∣ther end of the room, on the left hand, is the ar∣mour of king Henry the fifth, who conquered
<PB N="29" REF="27"/>France, with his flaming sword in his hand: he took more men prisoners than he had in his army.</P>
<P>Next is the figure of a fiery serpent, the head and tail of carved work, the body of pistols.</P>
<P>Facing the window, at the east end, is the form of a large and beautiful organ, made with six thou∣sand pistols, ten story, or ranges high.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="28"/>Between the windows, at the same end, is the re∣presentation of the Hydra, or seven-headed monster; three of which heads are above, and four below, and not one like the other, all of carved work.</P>
<P>Next, is king Henry the sixth's armour; he was crowned king of France: his father con∣quered the country, and this prince lost it.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="29"/>The first curiosity on the other side, coming back again, is the figure of Jupiter in his fiery chariot, drawn by eagles, in the clouds, with a thunderbolt in his hand, in carved work, guarded round with bayonets.</P>
<P>Second, is the star and garter made of pistols and bayonets; with the thistle, rose and crown over head, in carved work; and be∣low,
<PB N="32" REF="30"/>are birds, and other curious creatures, in fine carved work.</P>
<P>All the way down, on this side, are the same fi∣gures of arms, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> an∣swerable to those we de∣scribed in going up on the other.</P>
<P>Lastly, you are shewn a great parcel of arms ta∣ken in the assassination plot against king William, par∣ticularly a blunderbus,
<PB N="33" REF="31"/>with which the conspira∣tors designed to have shot that prince as he rid in his coach to Hampton-court; this hangs up over head: below, near the bottom, is a carbine, with which Charnock designed to have shot him as he rode a hunting.</P>
<P>Hence are likewise seve∣ral arms taken in Scotland, in the last rebellion: par∣ticularly a curious piece of
<PB N="34" REF="32"/>the late lord Mar's; and a large broad sword with which a highlander struck general Evans, and cut him through his hat, wig, and skull-cap.</P>
<P>There are in this small Armoury, besides these principal curiosities which I have mentioned, many fine things, which my young readers will be highly delighted to see. <HI>Here you pay</HI> Three-pence.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="33"/>The next curiousity is the train of artillery.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. II.</HI> Of the fine train of artil∣lery.</HEAD>
<P>THE grand store∣house where this curious train of artillery is kept, is directly under the small Armoury, upon the ground floor; where there
<PB N="36" REF="34"/>are a great number of cu∣rious brass cannon, of va∣rious sizes, all mounted upon carriages.</P>
<P>First, you are shewn a parcel of new battering cannon, each carrying a ball of twenty four pound weight.</P>
<P>Second, a train of ord∣nance, which carry balls of twelve pounds weight.</P>
<P>Third, fine field-pieces which carry cartridges of
<PB N="37" REF="35"/>small shot made up in bags.</P>
<P>Fourth, a couple of smith's forges upon carri∣ages, for conveniency of travelling, compleatly fur∣nished for repairing any kind of iron-work, that may be wanting upon the road, or in the camp.</P>
<P>Fifth, mortar-pieces, which throw bomb-shells of thirteen inches diame∣ter.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="36"/>Sixth, a great number of mortar-pieces for the same uses, of various sizes, cast in the reign of king George the first.</P>
<P>Seventh, the drum-ma∣jor's fine chair upon a car∣riage, in which he sits, with two kettle-drums fix∣ed before him, and is drawn by six horses in great state.</P>
<P>Eight, a curious brass cannon, made for Henry,
<PB N="39" REF="37"/>prince of Wales, eldest son of king James the first; of which the carving alone cost two hundred pounds. It hath this inscription up∣on it, <HI>Thomas and Richard Pit made this piece, Anno</HI> 1608.</P>
<P>Ninth, two French pie∣ces of ordnance, taken with count Tallard at the battle of Blenheim, in the year 1704.</P>
<P>Tenth, one of the first
<PB N="40" REF="38"/>iron guns in England, in∣vented about 360 years ago: it is twelve feet long.</P>
<P>Eleventh, the first in∣vented brass cannon, of a∣bout fifteen feet in length.</P>
<P>Twelfth, a large mor∣tar-piece which carries a bomb-shell of eighteen in∣ches diameter, and 500 weitht, and throws it two miles.</P>
<P>Thirteenth, a fire twist∣ed brass cannon, twelve
<PB N="41" REF="39"/>feet long; called Queen Elizabeth's pocket pistol: which they merrily tell you was designed for her horse's furniture when she rode a hunting.</P>
<P>Fourteeth, two curi∣ous brass field-pieces, of three-bore barrels, taken from the French at the memorable battle of Hoc∣stedt, on the second of Au∣gust, 1704.</P>
<P>Fifteenth, a mortar
<PB N="42" REF="40"/>which throws nine shells at a time.</P>
<P>Sixteenth, an engine of small mortars, which throws thirty hand-grana∣dos at a time.</P>
<P>Besides those already mentioned, there are a great number of other brass field-pieces, of vari∣ous sizes; and on the walls, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> a multitude of instruments made use of in war; such as crows, la∣dles,
<PB N="43" REF="41"/>wedges, screws, hand∣spikes and spunges; and harness for the horses which draw the train, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Over head you see a trophy of standards, co∣lours, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as in Guildhall, taken in the last war with France.</P>
<P>And, lastly, in going out there are two very cu∣rious brass cannon, twen∣ty four pounders, taken at Vigo, <HI>anno</HI> 1702. by the
<PB N="44" REF="42"/>present lord Cobham. The breeches of these guns re∣present couching lions.</P>
<P><HI>Here you pay</HI> Two pence <HI>each person.</HI></P>
<P>Next you proceed to the Horse Armoury.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="3" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. III.</HI> Of the Horse Armoury.</HEAD>
<P>HERE you are first presented with a
<PB N="45" REF="43"/>view of the sigures of the horse guards that attend the kings, whom you will see presently all on horse∣back in bright armour of polished steel, and ranged in beautiful order on the other side of the house; as also of a great number of foot-guards, standing be∣tween the horse, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Second, over head is the famous lance of Charles Brandon, duke of Suffolk,
<PB N="46" REF="44"/>king Henry the eighth's general in France.</P>
<P>Third, a suit of tilting armour, with which the nobility and gentry used to exercise, before guns were invented.</P>
<P>Fourth, a curious suit of armour made for king Henry the eighth, rough from the hammer, and ne∣ver filed.</P>
<P>Fifth, a little suit of ar∣mour for king Charles the
<PB N="47" REF="45"/>second, when he was prince of Wales; with a piece for his horse's head, of curious workmanship.</P>
<P>Sixth, my lord Cour∣cy's suit of armour, great champion of Ireland; and the large two-handed sword he took from the champion of France: for which gallant action he and his successors have the privilege of wearing their hats in the presence of the
<PB N="48" REF="46"/>kings of England; which is continued to this day. The lord Kinsale is now head of that noble family.</P>
<P>Seventh, a suit of In∣dian armour; sent as a present to king Charles the second, from the great Mogul, which is said to be a defence against arrows, darts, and poisoned lances, made use of in that coun∣try.</P>
<P>Eighth, a little suit of
<PB N="49" REF="47"/>armour made in remem∣brance of Richard, duke of York, who, with his brother Edward the fifth, was smothered in the Tower between two fea∣ther-beds, about two hun∣dred and fifty seven years ago; the former being about eleven years old, and the latter thirteen.</P>
<P>Ninth, John of Gaunt, duke of Lancaster's ar∣mour; he was both son
<PB N="50" REF="48"/>and father of a king, but never king himself. It is said he was seven feet four inches high.</P>
<P>Tenth, is the comical figure of Will. Somers, jester to king Henry the eighth.— He is called an honest man of woman's making—wears his horns upon his head to prevent the making holes in his pocket; and because he was dim-sighted, he would
<PB N="51" REF="49"/>believe neither the king, queen, nor any of the court, that he was a cuck∣old, till he had put his spectacles on; with which he is represented by way of ridicule to this day.</P>
<P>Eleventh, is an ill fa∣voured old instrument, cal∣led the <HI>collar of torment,</HI> which we are told was for∣merly put about the necks of such women as either proved false to their hus∣bands
<PB N="52" REF="50"/>beds, or took too great a freedom with their tongues.</P>
<Q><L>But long this collar has aside been cast.</L>
<L>Sure! they are now less noisy, and more chaste.</L></Q>
<P>Now we come to the kings on horse-back, who are placed in the following order: First, a curious figure
<PB N="53" REF="51"/>of king William the third.</P>
<P>Second, another of king Charles the second.</P>
<P>Third, of king Charles the first.</P>
<P>This suit of armour, which is steel, richly gilt with gold, cost, as we are informed, fifteen hundred pounds; and was a present from the city of London, when he was prince of Wales.</P>
<P>Fourth, of king James I.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="52"/>Fisth of king Edward the sixth, the first prote∣stant prince that ever reign∣ed in England: He was the royal founder of three hospitals, all which he gave to the city of Lon∣don; <HI>viz.</HI> that of St. Tho∣mas's for the relief of the sick and the lame; Christ's Church for the support of freemens children, who are orphans; and Bridewell, for training up of youth,
<PB N="55" REF="53"/>and the encouragement of several useful branches of our English manufactures, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

<PB N="61" REF="59"/>
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IV.</HI> Of the Regalia in the Jewel Office.</HEAD>
<P>THE inestimable trea∣sures which we are now to give our young readers a particular ac∣count of, are deposited or laid up in a dark, strong stone room, about twenty yards distant from the east end of the new Armoury.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="60"/>First, the imperial crown, with which all the kings of England have been crowned since the time of Edward the confessor. It is a very rich crown of gold, embellished with pearls and precious stones of divers kinds; namely, diamonds, rubies, eme∣ralds, and saphires, with a mound of gold on the top of it, encircled with a band or fillet of gold; adorned
<PB N="63" REF="61"/>also with precious stones, and three very large oval pearls; one on the top of the cross, and two others hanging at the end.</P>
<P>This crown is compos∣ed of four crosses, and as many flower de lis of gold, upon a rim or circlet of gold, all embellished with precious stones.</P>
<P>The cap within is of purple velvet, lined with white taffety, and turned
<PB N="64" REF="62"/>up with ermine, thick powdered in three rows.</P>
<P>Second, the orb, or globe, which is put into the king's right hand im∣mediately the king's right hand im∣mediately before he is crowned, and borne in his left upon his return into Westminster-hall.</P>
<P>It is a ball of gold, of six inches diameter, en∣compassed with a band or fillet of gold; embellished with roses of diamonds
<PB N="65" REF="63"/>encircling other precious stones, and edged about with pearl: on the top of it is a very large amethyst, of a violet or purple co∣lour, about and inch and an half in heighth, of an oval form; which being en∣compassed with four silver wires, makes the pedestal of a very rich cross of gold, of three inches and a quarter in heighth and three in breadth, set very
<PB N="66" REF="64"/>thich with diamonds; hav∣ing in the middle thereof a fair saphire on one side, and a fair emerald on the other, embellished with four large pearls in the corners of the cross, near its centre, and three large pearls at the end of the said cross.</P>
<P>The whole heighth of the ball and cross together is eleven inches.</P>
<P>Third, the royal scep∣tre
<PB N="67" REF="65"/>with the cross, which has another jewel of great value under it.</P>
<P>It is of fine gold; the handle plain, and the up∣per part wreathed: It is in length two foot nine inches and a quarter, and in compass three inches at the handle, and two and a quarter about the top. The pommel at the bot∣tom enriched with rubies, emeralds, and small dia∣monds.
<PB N="68" REF="66"/>The top rises in∣to a flower de lis of six leaves; three whereof are upright, and three hang∣ing down, all enriched with precious stones. Out of the same flower de lis iffueth a mound or ball, made of an amethyst, gar∣nished with table dia∣monds: and upon the mound or cross quite co∣vered with precious stones, with a large table diamond in the centre.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="67"/>Fourth, the sceptre with the dove, of fine gold, in length three feet seven in∣ches, and three inches a∣bout at the handle, and two and a quarter at the top. The pommel gar∣nished with a circle or fil∣let let of table diamonds, and in several places with pre∣cious stones of all sorts. The mound or ball at the top, embellished with rose diamonds; and on the top
<PB N="70" REF="68"/>of all a small Jerusalem cross, whereon is fixed a dove with wings expand∣ed, as the emblem of peace and mercy.</P>
<P>Fifth, Saint Edward's staff, all beaten gold, in length four feet seven in∣ches and a half, and about three inches and three quarters in circumference. This staff, which is gar∣nished also with gold, is carried before the king at his coronation.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="69"/>Sixth, a rich salt∣cellar or state, made in the form of the square whire Tow∣er; which is wrought with such exquisite art, that words cannot well express it. This inimitable piece of gold plate is used at all coronations.</P>
<P>Seventh, the <HI>curtann,</HI> or pointless sword of mer∣cy. This is a broad bright sword, the blade thirty two inches in length, and al∣most
<PB N="72" REF="70"/>two broad: the han∣dle is covered with a fine gold wire four inches, be∣sides the pommel an inch and three quarters, which with the cross is plain stell gilt: the length of the cross being almost eight inches. This sword of mercy is borne naked be∣fore the king at his coro∣nation, between the spiri∣tual and temporal swords of justices, of which it is the cheif.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="71"/>Eighth, a noble silver font, double gilt, in which the royal family are christ∣ned. This is likewise a great curiosity with re∣spect to its workmanship, antiquity, and solemn use, and is highly worthy of our young readers obser∣vation.</P>
<P>Ninth, a large silver fountain double gilt, which was a magnificent present from the town of Ply∣mouth
<PB N="74" REF="72"/>to their royal mas∣ter king Charles the se∣cond; the workmanship whereof is very curious, and the value very great.</P>
<P>Tenth, the rich crown of state which his majesty wears on his throne in par∣liament. It is embellished with divers large rose and table diamonds, and other precious stones; but most remarkable for a wonder∣ful large ruby set in the
<PB N="75" REF="73"/>middle of one of the cros∣ses, vauled at ten thousand pounds and upwards: as also for the large emerald which is seven inches round; a pearl, the finest in the world; and a ruby of inestimable value.</P>
<P>Eleventh, his royal high∣ness the prince of Wales's rich crown.</P>
<P>This and the crown of state last mentioned, when∣ever his majesty goes to
<PB N="76" REF="74"/>the parliament-house, are carried by the keeper of the jewel-office, attended by one or two of the war∣ders of the Tower, pri∣vately in a hackney coach to White-hall; where they are delivered to the proper officers, who with some yeomen of the guard car∣ry them to the robing rooms, where his majesty and the prince dress them∣selves. His majesty wears
<PB N="77" REF="75"/>his crown on his head whilst on the throne, and that belonging to the prince is placed before him, to shew that he is heir apparent to the crown. After the king has lest the house, and is disrobed, both the said crowns are conveyed back to the Tower in the same privated manner.</P>
<P>Twelfth, the rich crown of state, with the globe,
<PB N="78" REF="76"/>sceptre, and diadem, which queen Mary, the consort of his late majesy king William the third, wore in proceeding to her co∣ronation.</P>
<P>Thirteenth, an ivory sceptre with a dove on the top, made for the late king James's queen. This is in length three feet one inch and a half, the pom∣mel whereof and garna∣ture is gold, as is also the
<PB N="79" REF="77"/>mound which crosses the top. The dove is gold enamelled white; at the bottom it is about two inches round, at the top an inch and an half, or thereabouts.</P>
<P>Fourteenth, the golden spurs, which are very large and massy, and curiously wrought, of great antiqui∣ty, and are worn at coro∣nations; as are the <HI>armil∣la's,</HI> which are golden
<PB N="80" REF="78"/>bracelets for wrists.</P>
<P>Lastly, the <HI>ampulla,</HI> or eagle, of pur gold finely engraved, which holds the holy oil the kings and queens of England are an∣ointed with. It stands on a pedestal with its wings expanded. The head screws off at the middle of the neck, for the conve∣niency of pouring in the oil; the neck being hollow to the beak; the holy oil
<PB N="81" REF="79"/>is poured out into the large golden spoon set a∣part for that purpose, thro' the point of the beak; the heighth of this gol∣den eagle from bottom to top, including the pede∣stal of foot, is about nine inches; the wings where∣of expand about seven in∣ches. The weight of the whole is about ten ounces. This and the spoon are curiosities of great antiqui∣ty.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="80"/>There are, besides the inestimable treasures above particularly mentioned, se∣veral cuirous and valuable pieces of plate and other rich furniture, not usually exposed to publick view; a particular description of which would be too redi∣ous to be here inserted.</P>
<P>However, for the fur∣ther information and a∣musement of our little readers, we shall close this
<PB N="83" REF="81"/>chapter with a poetical account of the bold and unparalleled attempt of a desperate villain, with o∣thers of his associates, to strip the jewel-office of the royal crown, globe, sceptre, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> with the happy prevention of their wicked design; in which had they succeeded, the loss could never have been repaired.</P>

<HEAD>THE WOLF in SHEEPS CLOATHING; or, the VILLAIN TRIUMPHANT.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>Now, my young readers, lend an ear,</L>
<L>And you a matchless Tale shall hear,</L>
<L><PB N="85" REF="83"/>How one in a canonick gown,</L>
<L>Pilfer'd away old England's crown;</L>
<L>And how (which ag∣grandiz'd the matter)</L>
<L>The globe and sceeptre sollowed after:</L>
<L>But watchful provi∣dence decreed</L>
<L>To bring to light so dark a deed.</L>
<L><PB N="86" REF="84"/>In gay king Charles the second's days.</L>
<L>(So, readers, my historian says)</L>
<L>One Blood <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Blood was the son of a blacksmith in Ireland; a fellow that thought small villanies below him. — He once rescued a comrade of his out of the hands of the sheriff's officers, as they were leading him to the gallows. — At another time be laid a design in Ireland to surprize the castle of Dublin, &amp;c. and to usurp the government., But being discovered by the duke of Ormond, he vowed revenge. — Accodingly, one night he, with some of his asso∣ciates, went boldly up to the coach, took him out of it, and tied him fust behind one of his comrades, who role away with him; but the duke throwing him off his horse, and procuring assistance, got released. — Blood losing his repulation among his fellow rogues through this miscarriage, resolved to make amends by a more daring villany, that of stealing the Regalia.</NOTE>, one Parrot <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Parrot was a silk-dyer in Southwark; and in the Rebellion had been major∣general Harrison's lieute∣nant.</NOTE>, and another <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">The other was named Hunt, a son in law of Blood's, and trained up un∣der him.</NOTE></L>
<L>Notorious rogue, their friend and brother,</L>
<L><PB N="87" REF="85"/>Laid a bold scheme, in one half hour</L>
<L>To seize the treasures of the Tower.</L>
<L><PB N="88" REF="86"/>The better to secure success,</L>
<L>Blood strait put on a parson's dress,</L>
<L><PB N="89" REF="87"/>And took his wife, an artful jade,</L>
<L>Well yers'd in the Mercurial-trade <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">The art of thieving.</NOTE>,</L>
<L><PB N="90" REF="88"/>To see the jewels in the Tower,</L>
<L>And stay'd, at least, full half an hour.</L>
<L><PB N="91" REF="89"/>Madam <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Blood's wife.</NOTE> at length sunk gently down</L>
<L>Into an arti∣ficial swoon.</L>
<L>Blood, saint-like, lifted up his eyes,</L>
<L>And feign'd a husband's fond surprize:</L>
<L>One Edwards <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">The jewel-keeper' wife.</NOTE> who ther kept the house,</L>
<L><PB N="92" REF="90"/>With great indulgence treats his spouse;</L>
<L>Calls for assistance, holds her head,</L>
<L>And leads her gently up to bed.</L>
<L>With eyes half clos'd th' imposton fell,</L>
<L>Slunber'd an hour, and all was well.</L>
<L>The parson, at de∣parture, said,</L>
<L>How shall this goodness be repaid?</L>
<L><PB N="93" REF="91"/>Hence a firm friendship was profest,</L>
<L>And gifts his grati∣tude exprest.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In short—to ripen the design</L>
<L>Of this arch-villain, sham divine,</L>
<L>He made an offer quickly after</L>
<L><PB N="94" REF="92"/>To wed his <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">One who he pretend∣ed had three hundred a year in land, which was at his disposal.</NOTE> nephew with her daughter. —</L>
<L>Her husband lik'd the proposition:</L>
<L>Writings were drawn with expedition:</L>
<L>Fix'd in an instant was the day,</L>
<L><PB N="95" REF="93"/>The memorable ninth of May.</L>
<L>On which the bold attempt was made;</L>
<L>The crown was stoln, the villains fled,</L>
<L>And <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">He was keeper of the jewel-office.</NOTE> Edwards left at home for dead.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Treason and murder soon was cry'd;</L>
<L><PB N="96" REF="94"/>The crown beneath Blood's gown was 'spy'd;</L>
<L>And Parrot, being before suspected,</L>
<L>Was, with the globe conceal'd, detected.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus the Regalia were recover'd;</L>
<L>And thousands round the villains hover'd.—</L>
<L>Both were in irons quickly laid,</L>
<L><PB N="97" REF="95"/>And to the Tower, White Tower, convey'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Soon they were summon'd to Whitehall,</L>
<L>Where to the king Blood own'd it all.</L>
<L>Fearless, he added to't a lye.</L>
<L>Told him of a conspiracy,</L>
<L>If He or Parrot once should dye;</L>
<L><PB N="98" REF="96"/>Of men who would in ambush lay,</L>
<L>And take his precious life away:</L>
<L>But if they met with his compassion,</L>
<L>They'd prove of service to the nation.</L>
<L>The king, sore frightened at that time,</L>
<L>Not only pardon'd the bold crime,</L>
<L><PB N="99" REF="97"/>But, what is monstrous to declare,</L>
<L>Gave Blood five hundred pounds a year.</L>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. V.</HI> Of the Line, Batteries, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE line is a nar∣row, neat, paved way, just within the bat∣tlements of the wall which surrounds the Tower; up∣on this line, which is about half a mile in compass, are four batteries, which by means thereof have an
<PB N="101" REF="99"/>easy communication one with another.</P>
<P>The first entrance up∣on the line is just beyond Traitor's bridge, where is a clean paved walk about seventy yards long, called the <HI>ladies walk,</HI> because 'tis much frequented by the fair sex in summer evenings. On the left hand is a pleasant row of shady trees, extending from the one end to the
<PB N="102" REF="100"/>other; and on the right, the wall which encompas∣seth the Tower; over which is a delightful pro∣spect of the river Thames, with the ships, boats, &amp;<HI>c.</HI> passing up and down, as also of the wharf belong∣ing to the Tower, on which are planted sixty one large iron cannon.</P>
<P>At the farther end of the ladies walk you de∣scend the steps, and going
<PB N="103" REF="101"/>on a little way you ascend the line again, where pre∣sently you come to the first six gun battery, which commands the river to the fouth: here stands a centi∣nel, as there does likewise at each of the other bat∣teries.</P>
<P>A few yards from this battery, at the east end of the Tower, you come to the second six gun batte∣ry, which has likewise a

<P>From this battery, at about two hundred yards distance, you come to a spacious, strong, stone battery, where there are
<PB N="110" REF="108"/>eight large iron cannon mounted. This battery is at the north corner of the east end of the Tower.— From thence you pass on to the fourth battery, where there are six guns, which point towards the north. The guns are fired from all these batte∣ries, and from those also of the wharf, on some particular rejoicing days, such as the king's birth∣day,
<PB N="111" REF="109"/>being the 30th of October, and his return from abroad; and from the wharf alone, on all other royal holidays, and likewise as often as his majesty goes to the parlia∣ment house, and on the 29th of May, 5th of No∣vember, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>From the last battery we proceed to the royal mint, where all the gold, silver, and copper coins
<PB N="112" REF="110"/>and medals are struch; be∣longing to the manage∣ment of which there are several officers, of whom the warden is chief.</P>
<P>I could very willingly give my young readers a particular account of the art of making of money, but I am afraid it might tempt some naughty per∣sons to counterfeit, the current coin, for which I should be justly blamed,
<PB N="113" REF="111"/>and become in some mea∣sure accessary to the fatal consenquences that might attend it.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="6" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VI.</HI> Of the inside of the White tower.</HEAD>
<P>I Must first inform my young readers, that the inside of this grand Tow∣er
<PB N="114" REF="112"/>is not publickly shewn, but as they, in proceeding from one place to the o∣ther, in order to see the rarities, pass by it two or three times, and will very likely be inquisitive to know what is with inside, I shall therefore endeavour to satisfy their curiousity.</P>
<P>This Tower is a large magazine, or vast store∣house, filled with prodi∣gious numbers of various
<PB N="115" REF="113"/>kinds of instruments. of war: The vaults, which perhaps are the largest and finest in all the world, are filled with bags of salt pe∣tre, for the making of gunpowder. Upon the first sloor are several spa∣cious rooms; one of which is a small armoury for the sea service, for ten thou∣sand men. Which arms are of various sorts, very cu∣rious, and laid up in beau∣tiful order.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="114"/>In another room are a multitude of fine closets, presses and lockers, all fil∣led with an almost incre∣dible number of tools for the war service. As to gunpowder, there is but little kept in this place, only so much as will serve for the use of the garri∣son. This Tower has three very high stories, and, upon the top of all, fine leads; and, what is
<PB N="117" REF="115"/>surprizing, water from the Thames is forced by an engine to the top of this lofty Tower; where it fills a cistern of about seven feet deep, nine broad, and about sixty feet in length: being the biggest that I ever saw or heard of.</P>
<P>The walls of this strong Tower, are, at the ground∣floor, one and twenty feet thick; at the second,
<PB N="118" REF="116"/>about sixteen feet, and at the third about seven feet thick. At the south side of this White Tower is a room, formerly a chapel, where are kept the ancient records of this nation.</P>
<P>I shall next tell my rea∣ders the time and ceremo∣ny of opening and shut∣ting the gates of the Tow∣er, and so conclude this history.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="7" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="119" REF="117"/>
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VII.</HI> Of the ceremony of opening and shutting the gates of the Tower.</HEAD>
<P>AT half an hour after nine o'clock at night the bell on the top of the governor's house rings, to warn the inhabitants or others to go out, or come into the garrison, as their
<PB N="120" REF="118"/>affairs may require: At the same time the drum beats over the spur guard, at the entrance into the Tower, to give notice to the soldiers who are ab∣sent from duty, to come in; likewise at ten a-clock the tattoo beats, <HI>Go to bed, Tom,</HI> from the main guard, which is at the west side of the white Tower, quite round the Tower, to the place from whence they set out.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="119"/>At eleven o'clock (which is the hour they lock up the gates, both in winter and summer) the yeoman porter calls a serjeant and a file fo men to attend the keys to lock up the royal Tower; who pro∣ceed with him to the spur guard, or outer gates, which being secured, they go back to the main guard; where the yeoman porter cries, <HI>God bless the king;</HI>
<PB N="122" REF="120"/>the guard, who are drawn. up in order, answer <HI>Amen:</HI> From thence they go to the governor's house, where they lodge the keys; after which no person, up∣on any account whatso∣ever, can either go out or come into the Tower, till next morning; when the same ceremony is again observed at opening the gates; in the summer at half an hour after five,
<PB N="123" REF="121"/>and in the winter at seven.</P>
<P>About half and hour after nine, before they look up the Tower, one of the warders, with a guard of soldiers upon duty, locks up the gates upon the wharf, and, drawing up the draw-bridge, locks the gate which leads to it, and so retires into the Tower, after which no person can go out, or come in.</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="122"/>Having now shut the gates of the Tower, I have nothing more to add concerning the curiosities of this place — but I beg leave to inform my young readers, that the <HI>History of Westminster Ab∣bey</HI> is now in hand, and will be got ready for the press with all convenient speed: Subscribers are de∣sired to bring or send their names to <HI>Thomas Boreman</HI>
