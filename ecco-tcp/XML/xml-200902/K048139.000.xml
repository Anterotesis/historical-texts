<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR GEORGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I Don't know whose house we've got into here, John, but I think when he knows me, we may hope for some refreshment. Zounds, I'm as dry as touchwood, and to sail at the rate of ten knots an hour, ever stubble and farrow, from my own house, but half a league on this side of Gos∣port, and not to catch these deserters that received the King's bounty and run from their ships.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>You've ill luck.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR GEO.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mine, you swab.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, you've money and gold, but grace and good fortune have shook hands with you these nineteen years, for that rogue's trick you play'd
<PB N="6" REF="4"/>
Miss Amelia, by deceiving her with a sham mar∣riage, when you passd yourself for Capt. Sevmor, then putting to sea, leaving her to break her heart, then marrying another lady.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR GEO.</SPEAKER>
<P>But was I not forc'd to that by my father?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, because she had a great fortune—her death was a judgment upon you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR GEO.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, you impudent dog-fish—up∣braid me for running into false bay, when you was my pilot, was'n't you—even got me the mock clergyman that performed the sham marriage with Amelia?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(Aside.)</STAGE> You think so▪ but I took care to bring a real clergyman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR GEO.</SPEAKER>
<P>But is this a time or place for your lectures?—at home, abroad, at sea and land, will you still badger me? Mention my Wild Oats again, and—you scoundrel, since the night my bed-curtains took fire when you were my boatswain aboard the Eagle, you've got me quite into leading-strings—you snatch'd me up on deck, toss'd me into the sea to save me from being burnt, and I was almost drown'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>You would, but for me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR GEO.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes. you dragg'd me out by the ear, like a water dog. Last week, because you saw the tenth bottle uncork'd, you rushed in among my friends, and ran away with me. and the next morning Capt. O'Shanaghan sends me a challenge, for quitting my chair when he was toast-master—so to save me from the head-ach, you'd like to have got my brains blown out.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh. very well—be burnt in your bed, and tumble into the water, like a tight fellow as you are, and promise yourself with sloe juice, see if John cares a piece of mouldy biscuit about it.
<PB N="7" REF="5"/>
But I thought you had laid yourself up in ordi∣nary, retired to live quiet upon your estate, and had done with sea affairs.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR GEO.</SPEAKER>
<P>John, a man should forget his own convenience For his country's good,</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I wish you had'n't made me your valet de chambre—no sooner was I got on shore, after five years dashing upon rocks, showls, and breakers, then you set me upon a hard trotting cart-horse, that toss'd me up and down like an old bum-boat in the Bay of Biscay—and here's nothing to drink after all. Because at home you keep open house, you think every body else does the same.—Holloa, holloa—I'll never cease pip∣ing till it calls a drop to wet my whissle.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Exit.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR GEO.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, as John Dory remarks, I fear my trip through life will be attended with heavy squalls and foul weathers—When my conduct to poor Amelia comes athwart my mind, it's a hurri∣cane for all that day, and when I turn in at night the ballad of William and Margaret's Ghost <STAGE>sings!</STAGE>—Oh, zounds, the dismals are coming upon me, and I can't get a cheering glass to—Holloa!</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR GEO.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, zounds how is all this—unex∣pectedly find you in a strange house, of which old Sly tells me you're mistress, turn'd quaker, and disown your title.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY A.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thou knowest the relation to whose care my father left me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR GEO.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I know our cousin, old Dovehouse, was, a quaker, but did'n't suspect he would have made you one.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY A.</SPEAKER>
<P>Being now gathered to his fathers, he did bequeath unto me his worldly goods, amongst them this mansion, and the lands around it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EPH.</SPEAKER>
<P>So thou becomest and continue one of the faithful. I'm executor of his will, and by it cannot give thee possession of these goods but upon these conditions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR GEO.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tell me of your thee's and thou's, quaker's wills, and mansion, —I say, girl, tho' on the death on your father, my eldest brother, Loftus Earl-Thunder, from your being a female, his title devolves to his next brother, Robert; tho' as a

woman you can't be an Earl, nor as a woman you can't make laws for your sex nor for our sex, yet, as the Daughter of a peer, you are, and by heavens shall be, called Lady Amaranth Thunder.</P>

<P>Let Sarah prepare chambers for my kinsman; and hire the maiden for me that thou didst mention.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EPH.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will, for this damsel is passing fair, and hath found grace in mine eyes, Mary, as thou art yet a stranger in this land, and just taken poffession of this estate, the law of society doth command thee to be on terms of amity with thy wealthy neighbours.</P>

<SPEAKER>MIDG.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'm sure I don't know: as you de∣sired, I paid for our breakfast—but the devil's in that fellow, every inn we stop at he will always hang behind chattering with the bar-maid or the chamber-maid.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Or any, or no maid—but he's a wor∣thy lad, and I love him better, I think, than my own brother, had I one.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MIDG.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, but Dick, mind my boy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Stop, Midg. tho' 'twas my orders, when I set out on this scamp with the players, the better to conceal my quality, for you before peo∣ple to treat me as your companion, yet for you at the same time should have had discretion enough to remember when we are alone that I am your master, and son to Sir George Thunder.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MIDG.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I ask your pardon; but by mak∣ing yourself my equal, I've got so used to fami∣liarity, that I find it curs'd hard to shake it off.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Sir. pray mind that famili∣arity is all over, my frolic is out, I now throw off the player, and shall return directly. My father must by this time have heard of my departure from the academy at Portsmouth, and tho' I was deluded away by my rage for acting, 'twas bad of me to give the gay old fellow any cause of unea∣siness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MIDG.</SPEAKER>
<P>And, Sir, shall I and you never act another scene together—shall I never again play Sir Harry Wildair for my own benefit, nor ever again have the pleasure of caneing your honour in the character of Alderman Smuggler?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>In future, act the part of a smart coat and hat-brusher, or I shall have the pleasure of caneing you in the character of one that gives mighty blows. You were a good servant, but sirrah, I find by letting you crack your jokes and sit in my company, you're grown quite a rascal.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="13" REF="11" MS="y"/>
<SPEAKER>MIDG.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir, I was a modest well be∣haved lad, but evil communications corrupt good manners.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Run back and tell Rover to make haste. To bring you down, I'll clap a livery on you—wear that, or find another master.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MIDG.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Sir, I don't mind wearing a livery; but when one has so long had a halbert, it's damn'd hard to be again put into the rank.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, if my father but forgives me, this three months excursion with the players has shew'd me some life, and a devilish deal of fun—for one circumstance, I shall ever remember it with pleasure—it's bringing me acquainted with Jack Rover—how long he stays—Jack <STAGE>(calls).</STAGE> In this forlorn stroller I have discovered qualities that honour human nature, and accomplishments that might grace a prince. My poor friend has often lent me his money; though he supposed me a poor needy devil, that could never be able to pay him. He shan't know who I am till it's in my power to serve him; only the rogue always marr'd the grand design of my frolic—I had no chance among the pretty women where he was; he had the knack of winning their hearts by his gaiety. Tho' so devilish pleasant in his quotations, which on the moment he dashes in a parody whimsically opposite to every occasion as it happens, I hope he won't find the purse I've hid in his pocket be∣fore we part. I dread the moment—but it's come.</P>

<P>Beg your pardon, my dear Dick, all the fault of—plague on on't, that a man can't sleep and breakfast at an inn, then return to his bed-chamber for his gloves, but there he must find chamber-maids thumping feathers and knocking pillows about, and keep one, when one has affairs and business—upon my soul these girls' conduct to us is intolerable, the very thought brings blood into my face, and when ever they attempt to serve and provoke me so—Dam'me but I will—An't I right Dick?</P>

<P>THE fanciful flights of my pleasant cousin enchants my senses; this book he gave me to read con∣taineth good morals, the man Shakespear, that did write it, they call immortal: he must indeed have been filled with divine spirit. I understand, from my cou∣sin, the origin of plays were religious mysteries; that, freed from the superstition of early, and grossness of latter times, the stage is now become the vehicle of delight and morality; if so, to hear a good play is taking the wholesome draught of precept from a gol∣den cup, emboss'd with gems, yet giving my coun∣tenance to have one in my house, and even to act in it myself, prove the ascendency my dear Harry has over my heart.

<P>Your opinion of our intended exploit has made me ashamed of myself—Harkee, Jack, do you punish and frighten my adviser, do you still keep up your character of young 'Squire Thunder—you can easily do that, as he, no more than myself, has ever seen the 'Squire.</P>

<P>Ha, ha, ha, this is the drollest adven∣ture—Rover little suspects that I am the identical 'Squire Thunder that he personates—I'll lend him my character a little longer—yes this offer is a most ex∣cellent opportunity of making my poor friend's for∣tune, without injuring any body. If possible, he shall have her, I can't regret the loss of charms I never knew, and for an estate, my father is competent to all my wishes. Lady Amaranth, by marrying Jack Ro∣ver, will gain a man of honour, which, she might loose in an Earl—it may teaze my father a little at first, but he's a good old fellow in the main, and when, I think, he comes to know my motive!—Eh, this must be she—an elegant woman, faith—now for a spanking lie, to continue her in the belief that Jack is the man she thinks him.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR GEO.</SPEAKER>
<P>Niece, I have been a villain to this lady, I confess but, my dear Amelia, providence has done you justice in part, for from the first month I quitted you, I have never entered one happy hour on my journals—hearing that you foundered, and con∣sidering myself the cause, the worm of remorse has knaw'd my timbers.</P>
