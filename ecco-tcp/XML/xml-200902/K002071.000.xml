<P>IN one of our conferences, I think I told you<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page <HI>21.</HI> Indeed the whole of Discourse <HI>III.</HI> should be read and well understood, before this sketch of Sacred History is studied, as indeed should Discourses <HI>VII. VIII. IX.</HI> and <HI>X.</HI> before the view of English History.</NOTE> that all mankind from Adam until now, have received the benefits of the death and passion of our Redeemer. Of course, our religion has been the same from the beginning of the world. Men have ever acknowledged the same God as the Creator, and the same Christ as the Saviour of the world. But this ac∣knowledgment was not sufficient to save mankind before the coming of our Saviour. Men found it necessary to practise <HI>natural</HI> religion, before the introduction of <HI>revealed;</HI> that is to say, to submit to the principles of right and equity, which God had engraved upon their hearts, before he thought proper to give them any di∣rections on that head. They did as they would be done by, and acted in conformity to conscience and to reason. Such was the religion of Adam and his posterity. To render it however more venerable, and testify their de∣pendance on the sovereign majesty of God, they made use of ceremonies, and an outward form of worship; they
<PB N="2" REF="7"/>erected altars and sacrificed, on those altars, certain ani∣mals and fruits of the earth, as emblematical of the great sacrifice of Jesus Christ in after-times. <HI>Then</HI> the distinction of priest and people was unknown. Till the time the Moses, all men were priests, and very one offered to the Lord, the humble homage of his depend∣ance and his gratitude.</P>

<P>I will endeavour to gratify you in this par∣ticular; shall not, however, enter minutely into every lit∣tle incident attendant on this history, I shall give you only the great outlines of the progress of that religion which it pleased the Creator to establish among men. To assist your memory in this, it will be necessary to divide the time into six periods, that you may not confound one age with another.</P>
<P>The <HI>first</HI> period then shall contain a view of the prin∣cipal events that occurred from the creation of the world to the deluge, or it's destruction by water.</P>
<P>The <HI>second</HI> shall give you an idea of the history of mankind from the deluge, to the calling of Abraham, who was the father of the Jewish nation.</P>
<P>The <HI>third</HI> will shew you the progress of the Jews to their entrance into the land of Canaan, the land which God allotted for their inheritance.</P>
<P>The <HI>fourth</HI> will lay before you the various revolutions that took place in this rising nation, to the time of their most flourishing state, when Solomon built his temple.</P>
<P>The <HI>fifth</HI> shall begin with the captivity of Babylon, whose people merited slavery by their crimes; and,</P>
<P>The <HI>sixth,</HI> will represent to you the state of the same people, from the time they recovered their freedom, under the reign of Cyrus king of Persia, till the birth of Christ.</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>THE FIRST EPOCH.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. The first then of the six epochs or periods is that, which begins with the world and ends with the deluge,
<PB N="3" REF="8"/>and comprehends the occurrences of 1656 years, that is to say, from Adam to Noah.</P>
<P>Not long after the fall of our first parents they had two sons, CAIN and ABEL. The dispositions of these two brothers were of a contrary cast. Cain was of an ava∣ricious, proud, impious turn of mind, whereas Abel was all meekness, humility and generosity; now as the sa∣crifices, or homage offered to God, by the one, was more acceptable to him, than those of the other, it occasioned such a jealousy and hatred in Cain, that he sought an opportunity to murder his brother.</P>
<P>The death of Abel armed the vengeance of the Lord against his murderer, and God to punish him, gave him over to the bitterest remorse. A man's conscience, when keen, is a sufficient punishment for almost any crime. To this conscience Cain was committed, and we are told that his sin so afflicted him, that it was <Q>more than he was able to bear.</Q> He was driven out from society, and thus agitated by his fears, sat about building the first city, as an asylum from the hatred and persecution of mankind.</P>
<P>Adam was consoled for the loss of Abel and the de∣pravity of Cain by the birth of Seth, who was the se∣cond patriarch, or head of a family, before the de∣luge.</P>
<P>The family of this man was virtuous and religious, whilst that of Cain was the contrary; and it was not till the time of Enos, the third patriarch and son of Seth, that the true worship of God took place in the family of Cain. This was about 325 years after the creation.</P>
<P>The great great-grandson of Enos, was Enoch the father of Methuselah, he who was the longest liver, and died at the age of 969. This Enoch was taken up into heaven in a miraculous manner, soon after the death of Adam, who dying, at the age of 930, plunged mankind into a general nourning.</P>
<P>The death of Adam, the taking up of Enoch, and the old age of the other patriarchs, who till now, seemed to have kept men within certain bounds, gave a loose to universal corruption. Nothing could check it.
<PB N="4" REF="9"/>The virtuous fell in with the depravity of the vicious; in a word, impiety grew to such an excess, that God, in equity of judgment, determined to extirpate this criminal race of men from the earth.</P>
<P>Among the whole there was only one good man. This was the patriarch Noah, the grandson of Methu∣saleh and of the tenth generation from Adam, by his son Seth: him God was pleased to favour and reveal to his design of destroying the world by an universal deluge, and that 120 years before it happened. In order to save this man and his family, he directed him to build a large vessel, which we call an <HI>Ark.</HI></P>
<P>During this interval, Noah denounced to sinners the terrible event that threatened them; but, they shut their ears to his salutary admonitions, and laughed at the dreadful account he held forth to them, till the horrible event took place. Noah alone, his wife, his three sons and their wives, with a male and female of every animal then living were reserved to re-people and re-stock the earth. This happened in the year of the world 1656, when Noah was about 600 years old.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have heard the long lives of people living before the flood disputed, and that that which we call a year, was a period of much shorter duration.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Such things <HI>have</HI> been advanced, but merely on conjecture. In the early ages of the world, when fa∣milies on the earth were few, it was perhaps necessary, or at least not attended with any inconvenience, that men should live and beget children for eight or nine hundred years, in order to people the globe; but, was mankind to live now as long, it is evident from the po∣pulousness of every country, that the earth would be over-stocked, and not large enough to provide for man∣kind. On this account, Providence has wisely shortened our days and ordered that, there shall be no more inha∣bitants than the earth is capable of maintaining. Be∣sides, God might then have thought proper to extend the lives of men to a very great age, in order to hand down to posterity the wonders of his power and his
<PB N="5" REF="10"/>goodness, which, as printing was then unknown, could not be otherwise done than by tradition.</P>
<P>The ten patriarchs, that lived before the flood, namely, Adam, Seth, Enos, Cainan, Mahalaleel, Jared, Enoch, Methuselah, Lamech, and Noah, (each of which was the son of the person preceding him.) were the de∣positaries of the holy law, before it was published on Mount Sinai; and of these ten, Adam lived 56 years after Lamech was born, and Lamech lived till Noah was 595 years old, that is, till within six years of the deluge; and as Noah lived 350 years afterwards, it is plain, that the history of above 2000 years was within the memory of three persons; the accounts given therefore by these three men, corroborating the assertions of the other seven patriarchs, leave no room to doubt the ve∣racity of their traditions.</P>
<P>So again of the ten patriarchs after the flood. Shem, the first patriarch, the son of Noah, lived 150 years after the birth of Abraham the tenth patriarch, whose son Isaac was a cotemporay to Levi, the father, or grand∣father of Moses. Hence it follows, that Moses wrote nothing but that was in the memory of man; since he was not more than four or five generations removed from Abraham; and, Abraham being alive with many who had seen Noah and the deluge, and Noah with many that had seen Adam and the first ages of the world; it follows, that Adam could not be unknown to Noah and his son Shem, nor these, to Abraham or Jacob; nor Jacob to Moses; particularly at a time, when this tra∣dition concerned their own family, and was the only his∣tory fathers could teach their children.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have followed you, Sir, with attention, and see clearly that the history of the first ages of the world, have passed through too few hands to be altered, in the days of Moses; not more than seven or eight per∣sons from Adams to Moses, a period of near 2500 years. —But, Sir, there is a new difficulty which strikes me, and which I wish to have cleared up, and that is how so great a multitude of animals, as two of each species, which covered the earth, could be contained in the ark,
<PB N="6" REF="11"/>so long as a year; which I understand the deluge conti∣nued!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>In the first place, it must be considered that, according to the dimensions of the ark given us in scrip∣ture, it was four times as large as a first-rate man of war, which is capable of containing seven or eight hundred men, with as many troops, with necessary provisions for six months, and at the same time loaded with rigging, one hundred pieces of heavy cannon, and their proper ammunition; whereas, in the ark, were only eight per∣sons, besides the animals and their provisions for a year.</P>
<P>In the next place, it must be understood, that the ori∣ginal species of animals were not so numerous as have been thought. All the species of dogs, for example, may have arisen from one species, as all the species of pears may have sprung from the first pear-tree; or the different species of men from the same original.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, Sir, is it natural to conclude that men of different complexions, white, swarthy, copper-colour∣ed and black, sprung from the same stock?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes. Our exterior varieties are subject to change. We no way resemble the ancient Britons of this country. This race of people has ceased by mixing with others. The Arabians, who lived a long time in Spain, and who were originally of a black cast, have now retired to Morocco and Tunis. The natives of the western part of Africa are <HI>blacker</HI> than they formerly were, those about Tunis <HI>whiter.</HI> Where there is no mix∣ture of people, the same colour has continued, but one alteration is sufficient to destroy our conclusions, that men of different complexions <HI>must</HI> spring from different stocks.</P>
<P>No animal produced by two animals of a different kind, ever breeds: that is, mongrels never perpetuate their species; but, a bitch produced by a greyhound and a terrier will have young; of course, a greyhound and a terrier are, in fact, of the same species; we may say the same of a child born of a negro-woman and a white man. But let us continue the history of religion.</P>

<PB N="7" REF="12"/>
<HEAD>THE SECOND EPOCH.</HEAD>
<P>Soon after the deluge, change of living, and <HI>animal</HI> food being substituted in the room of <HI>vegetable,</HI> with other causes, brought on a decrease in length of life. Some precepts were given to Noah; the confusion of tongues happened at the tower of Babel in the year of the world 1878, which was the first monument of the pride and wickedness of men; and the allotment of district to the three children of Noah, was the first distribution of land.</P>
<P>An account of these first three founders of nations is still preserved. From Japhet, the eldest son of Noah, sprung the inhabitants of the north of Europe and Asia, as well as those of the west; from Shem came the people of the east, as also the Jews; and, from Ham and his son Canaan, descended the Canaanites, Philistines, Egypti∣ans, and the ancient possessors of Africa.</P>
<P>A little after this first division of territory, that is about 1879 of the world, Nimrod, a man of savage disposition, became the first of conquerors, and established his king∣dom at Babylon. He was the father of Ninus, who found∣ed the Assyrian monarchy.</P>
<P>Every thing had a beginning; there is no history so an∣cient that has not vestiges of the infancy of the world. We have seen laws established, manners become polished, and empires formed; men have risen by degrees from a state of ignorance; experience has improved them, and arts have multiplied and grown to perfection under their hands. In proportion as mankind encreased, mountains were passed, rivers and seas were traversed, and new ha∣bitations were established.</P>
<P>The earth, which in the beginning was merely an im∣mense forest, took on a new form. Woods grubbed up, gave place to fields, to meadows, to villages and towns; men employed themselves in taking animals, taming them and making them useful. Meeting with opposition they first began their contest with wild beasts. They next invented arms, then turned those arms against each other, and took pride in war. Nimrod, the first war∣rior and the first conqueror, is called in scripture, <Q>A
<PB N="8" REF="13"/>great hunter.</Q> Afterwards, men found out the art of cultivation; converted metals to their use, and turned every article in nature to some advantage.</P>
<P>But though men enriched society by the invention and improvement of arts, they on the other hand dishonoured it by the greatest excesses, till in the end, they drew upon them the vengeance of the Lord. In vain did the world, still dripping as it were, with the waters of the deluge, in vain did the striking decrease in the duration of human life, in vain did the overthrow of nature, still present dreadful monuments of the justice of an irritated Creator. The knowledge of a Supreme Being was effa∣ced from the memory of man; ancient traditions were obscured and forgotten, and fables took their place. Instead of paying that tribute of adoration to the <HI>Most-High</HI> which was due from all that breathed. they prosti∣tuted a sacrilegious incense to animals, and by an in∣conceivable depravity, even kings fell down before them and worshipped them. Scarce was found a family faith∣ful to the God of Adam and of Noah; insomuch, that the Father of nature, weary of threatning, waiting, and punishing, abandoned mankind and left them to their perverseness.—Such was the unhappy progress of sin in the short space of 426 years, the duration of this second epoch.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>What became then, Sir, of the true reli∣gion? Did God in anger deprive men of it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>No. The word of the Lord is irrevocable, and the certain effect always follows his promise. Had he attended only to the sin of our fore-fathers, he would doubtless have destroyed that wicked race; but his mercy kept pace with his justice, and a prospect of the future merits of the Redeemer which he had announced to the world, called back his clemency, and induced him to forbearance.</P>
</SP>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>THE THIRD EPOCH.</HEAD>
<P>In the midst of these crimes which sullied the world, God, ever watchful for the preservation of religion, perceived one just man of the family of Shem, and
<PB N="9" REF="14"/>through him determined to separate the true worshippers, from the rest of mankind. This was Abraham, and he was chosen to be the stock and father of the faithful. This was in the year of the world 2108.</P>
<P>The Most-High called him into a country inhabited by the posterity of Canaan, determining to establish there his worship and the children of this patriarch, whom he had resolved to multiply as the stars of heaven and as the sand of the sea. To the promise he made him of giving this land to his descendants, he added a more illustrious good, namely, that great blessing he bestowed through him on all the human race; for, of Abraham's family Jesus Christ was born.</P>
<P>From Jacob, the grandson, of Abraham, and whom Isaac his father blessed in preference to his elder brother Esau, (thus executing the will of God, though he was apparently deceived into it) sprang the Israelites or Jews, so called from <HI>Israel,</HI> the name given him from his wrestling with an angel, in the year of the world 2296.</P>
<P>After the death of Jacob, (whose son Joseph had made such a figure in the court of Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and the administration of his government,) the house of Abraham became a great people, and multiplied so prodigiously, as to excite the jealousy of the Egyptians. The Israelites or Hebrews faithful to their God, were in the very centre of the most monstrous and absurd ido∣latry, unjustly hated, and unmercifully persecuted. But the Lord raised up Moses as their protector and de∣liverer; having saved him from the waters of the Nile, where, by an order of the king, all the male children of the Israelites were thrown, with a design to defeat a prophecy, that one should then be born, that should rescue the Israelites from their servitude. From the waters of the Nile, to which Moses, then an infant, was committed, in the year of the world 2464, he fell under the notice of Pharaoh's daughter, there walking, who rescued him from a watery grave, and brought him up as her own son.</P>
<P>For forty years, Moses despised the riches of the court of Egypt; and, moved with the distresses of his brother
<PB N="10" REF="15"/>Israelites, whom Pharaoh continued to persecute, com∣bated every danger to comfort them. But they, far from profiting by his zeal and his resolution, exposed themselves to the fury of Pharaoh, who was determined on their ruin. Moses saved himself by flight; he fled into Arabia, where he passed forty years as a shepherd; at the end of which time, he saw the burning bush, from the midst of which God spake to him and directed him to return to Egypt, and free his brethren from their slavery.</P>
<P>The pains he took to effect this, his remonstrances with Pharaoh, his punishment of that king, by bringing on his country the many plagues it endured, his con∣ducting the Israelites across the red sea, where the water miraculously divided to the right and left, to suffer them to pass through and united again, to drown Pharaoh and all his host, attempting to follow them, in order to force them back, you are too well acquainted with, to need a repetition here. All that is necessary to know is, that Moses through the interference of God, became the de∣liverer of the Jewish nation, after more than two ages of servitude, and 430 years after the calling of Abra∣ham. This was in the year of the world 2544; or, 1510 years before the birth of Christ.</P>

<HEAD>THE FOURTH EPOCH.</HEAD>
<P>God having freed his people from the tyranny of the Egyptians, to conduct them to a land which he had pro∣mised to their father, laid down the law which he would have them to follow.</P>
<P>In the journey of these Israelites (in number 600,000, besides old men, women and children) God provided for them miraculously; he rained down manna, a kind of bread, from Heaven, and water gushed out from rocks, at the command of their leader; nor did their cloaths wear out, but fitted them and their children during their whole journey, which took up the space of forty years.</P>
<P>They no sooner had passed the red sea, and were free from the pursuit of the Egyptians, than God directed Moses to ascend Mount Sinai occasionally, (the Israelites continuing at the foot of it,)where he delivered into his
<PB N="11" REF="16"/>hands two tables of stone, on which he had engraved the decalogue, or ten commandments; and, at times, gave him such other instructions as he thought necessary. This decalogue was by no means a new law, but that which God had written in the hearts of all men, long before; it containing only the first principles of man's duty to God and to his neighbour. His renewal of this law, and giving it in writing was because the ignorance and passi∣ons of men had almost effaced it from their memory. In one of his visits to the top of Sinai he continued forty days, during which the Israelites murmured, and fancy∣ing Moses had deserted them, made a golden calf and fell down and worshipped it. Moses, on his return, to punish the guilty, called the children of Levi and ordered them to put the idolaters to death, which they did to the number of three thousand.</P>
<P>After God had delivered the commandments to Moses, he gave him other precepts, which he was to consider as an explanation of the written law. He ordered him to build a temple or tabernacle to deposit this law in; to erect an altar and stablish a priesthood. To this office Moses appointed his brother Aaron. Thus did God esta∣blish ceremonies and an outward form of worship, and the Levites, the grand-children of Jacob by their father Levi, were consecrated to serve at the altars.</P>
<P>After these great establishments they pursued their jour∣ney into the desarts of Arabia. Before the completion of which Moses died, and God appointed Joshua his successor, who ordered this history, which Moses had begun, to be continued.</P>

<P>The hisory which Moses wrote is contained in the five books of <HI>Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers,</HI> and <HI>Deuteronomy,</HI> called the <HI>Pentateuch,</HI> and which com∣prize the institution of religion. <HI>Genesis</HI> contains the his∣tory of the world, from the creation to the death of Joseph, a space of 2369 years; <HI>Exodus</HI> comprehends the history of the Jews, from the death of Joseph, to the building of the tabernacle, an interval of 145 years, <HI>Le∣viticus</HI> unfolds the administration of the Levite's; Moses
<PB N="12" REF="17"/>here treats of the ceremonies of the Jewish religion, the different sorts of sacrifices, and other things. In <HI>Numbers,</HI> we have what happened to God's people in the space of six weeks only. In <HI>Deuteronomy,</HI> Moses gives a recapitu∣lation of the law to those whose fathers died in passing the desarts, and relates every thing that happened from their leaving Egypt till that time. The subsequent books, conti∣nued, by order of Joshua, are the book of <HI>Joshua,</HI> the books of <HI>Judges, Samuel,</HI> and of the <HI>Kings.</HI></P>
<P>After the death fo Moses, God multiplied his favours upon his chosen people. Docile to the voice of Joshua, as the <HI>red sea</HI> had divided in obedience to the command of Moses, the river Jordan divided and presented them a passage also. Every thing fled at the approach of the Hebrew general; all opposition fell before him, and the land of Canaan became the property of these new comers. Ramparts of towns fell miraculously at the sound of their trumpets, the sum supended his course to enable them to complete their victories; and, the powerful hand of the Master of Nature was seen in every step they took.</P>

Now, from Abraham, through King David in a right line, sprung Joseph, the husband of Mary, the mother of our Saviour. David was a lineal descendant of Abraham, four∣teen generations removed, and Joseph twenty-seven gene∣rations removed from David; so that Christ was only sixty generations, from father to son, removed from Adam. This family from Abraham is traced in the first chapter of the Gospel of Saint Matthew.</P>
<P>After the death of Joshua, which happened soon after the establishment of the Israelites in the land of Canaan, things went pretty smoothly on for a number of years. At times they forgot the goodness of God to them, and allied themselves to their idolatrous neighbours, the con∣sequence of which was, the Lord threw them again into bondage. As often as they returned to their duty, the Lord was their friend and deliverer, and whenever they failed in that duty, they became slaves to some sovereign power. In this state they continued, with very little al∣teration, till the end of the fourth Epoch, and the reign of Solomon, son of David, their king, 480 years after their departure from Egypt, and 1012 years before the birth of Christ.</P>

<P>After the death of Solomon, which happened 975 years before Christ, the Israelites dissembled and chose Reho∣boam, the son of Solomon, their king; but the people under Jeroboam, applying to him for the redress of some grievances, and being harshly denied, ten of the tribes revolted, and set up Jeroboam as king of Israel; whilst Rehoboam reigned over the tribes of Judah and Benjamin, who preserved the religion of Moses, and continued in the faith of Abraham. To these the Levites joined them∣selves. This faction or division of the kingdom of Israel lasted 254 years.</P>
<P>The reign of Jeroboam and his successors were however troubled, he experienced the displeasure of Heaven; whilst those of Judah were particularly patronized. The revolving tribes felt the severe effects of war and famine, so that mothers were reduced even to the necessity of feed∣ing

<P>Babylon was triumphant, but her affairs became after∣wards disordered, and the period marked by the prophets for the re-establishment of Juda arrived amidst these trou∣bles.

<P>Is there no other book, in which the history of the Jews is related but the Holy Bible?</P>

<P>We have it there, that is, in the bible, upon the most unquestionable authority; but, this history is also related in the works of Josephus, a learned Jew, who wrote soon after the death of our Saviour; that is, in the year 40.</P>
<P>This peace, however, was in some measure interrupted by Alexander the Great, about 335 years before Christ, who, passing out of Europe, laid waste the Persian empire. Being on the march to Jerusalem in order to besiege it; the high-priest put on his priestly habit, and with a great number of people cloathed in vestments went out to meet him. As soon as Alexander saw the high-priest, he fell prostrate before him, saying, that whilst he was in Mace∣donia, a man appeared to him in the very same habit, and invited him into Asia, promising to deliver the Persian empire into his hands: and the high-priest shewing him the prophecy of Daniel, <Q>that a Grecian should come and destroy the Persians,</Q> he was confirmed in the perswasion that he himself was the man. This led him to respect the temple he designed to pillage and destroy, and to support the Jews in their privileges. In short, he sub∣dued the Persians, Darius was slain, and Alexander be∣came universal monarch over the eastern world.</P>
<P>It was about this time, that is, about 277 years before Christ, that seventy Jews distinguished for their learning, were employed by Ptolemy, king of Egypt, with consent of the nation, to translate the bible from its original He∣brew into Greek. It is from these called the <HI>Septuagint</HI> translation. Hence the Jewish religion began to be the known among the Gentiles; the temple of Jerusalem was enriched with gifts both from kings and people, and the Jews were respected every where.</P>
<P>Allured by the treasures within the temple, Seleucus, king of Syria, sent a person to bring it away; this man was struck down by angels and almost killed, but at the prayers of the high-priest, soon after recovered.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="22"/>Antiochus, however, who succeeded Seleucus, on the throne of Syria, conceived a design of destroying the Jewish nation, and dividing it's wealth among his own peo∣ple; he succeeded in his enterprize, sacked the city, slew 40,000 of the inhabitants, took as many prisoners, pillaged the temple, and endeavoured to abolish the worship of God.</P>
<P>Matthias, and his son Judas Maccabeus, opposed the violence of this tyrant, and with a handful of soldiers, performed wonders, destroyed the army of Antiochus, and purified the temple, three years and an half after it's prosanation.</P>

<P>After this the Jews became a flourishing nation, and continued so with but few alterations or changes, till about 40 years before the birth of Chrish, when Pompey, the Roman general, disspossessed Antiochus the last king of Syria, took Jerusalem and made the Jews tributary to the Romans.</P>

<P>Before the Romans entered this island, which was fifty four years before the birth of Christ, the country was po∣pulous, and stored with great plenty of animals, savage and domestic. Towns were few and house were meanly built and scattered up and down.

<P>No customs, truly British or Roman, were now to be seen. The language of the country, which had been either Latin or Celtic, was discontinued, and the Saxon, that is English, only was spoken. The kingdom was di∣vided into counties or shires, and the English, if com∣pared to the naked Britons at the invasion of Caesar, might be considered as polite. Houses, furniture, cloaths and other luxuries were as general then as at present. They were only incapable of sentimental pleasure; all the learning of the times was centred in the clergy, who were over-run with ignorance and superstition.</P>

<P>Egbert was scarce settled on his throne, than the whole kingdom was alarmed by the approach of an unexpected enemy. A swarm of those nations that possessed the countries bordering on the Baltic, began, under the names of Danes and Normans, to infest the western coasts of Europe, plundering those very people who, some centuries before, had invaded the places where they were now set∣tled, and driven out the inhabitants. The Normans fell upon the Northern coasts of France; the Danes, on the Southern parts of England.</P>
<P>A. D. 832. The people of this island had been too much exhausted in civil war to make much opposition. Some battles were fought, but the Danes kept their foot∣ing, fortified posts and passages, and built castles for their defence; of which there are many remains at this day.</P>

<P>In this period of cruelty, jealousy and desolation; a man seemed raised up to defend the rights of his bleeding coun∣try, and improve the age in which he lived. This was Alfred, the fourth son of Ethelwolf, king of England, and grandson of Egbert, who, on the death of his brother Ethelred, was called to the English crown, of which he was put into possession only nominally, the country being over-run by the Danes.</P>
<P>His reign began with wars, and his first battles were fought with succeess; but, being at length overpowered, he was obliged to save himself by flight.

<P>A fortunate victory over the Danes, by the Earl of Devonshire—Not knowing how to get at the strenght of the enemy, Alfred disguised himself as a shep∣herd, and traversed the Danish camp with a harp, and as he excelled on this instrument, he soon got access to the Danish generals; finding they were divided among them∣selves, he seized the favourable opportunity, flew to the Earl of Devonshire, headed his troops, forced their camp and gained a complete victory.</P>

<SPEAKER>ERAST,</SPEAKER>
<P>His natural son Athelstan, in 924, under whose auspices the bible was translated into Saxon, and the thristian religion gained ground. His son, Edmund the first, was his successor, in 941; whose reign is no otherwise re∣markable, than by his instituting the first capital punishment, having ordained that, in gangs of robbers, when taken, the oldest should be hanged. He lost his life in a very extra∣ordinary manner, after a reign of seven years. Solemniz∣ing a festival, in Gloucestershire, and observing a fellow, who had been banished the kingdom for his crimes, fitting at one of the tables in the hall where he dined; he was so offended at his insolence, that he ordered him to be appre∣hended; and, perceiving the villain drawing a dagger, in order to defend himself, the king started up, and, catching him by the hair, dragged him our of the hall; but, in doing this he met his death, for the ruffian, in the scuffle, stab∣bed him to the heart.</P>
<P>Edred, his brother, succeeded him, and was so weak a prince, that under him the monks gained great influence, and had the chief direction of affairs. He died in 955; left several sons, but being very young they were set aside, and Edwy, his eldest brother's son, was placed on the throne. At this time, the crown appears to have been elective, and those elections wholly influenced by the cler∣gy. The English during this short reign were divided by re∣ligious disputes and involved in civil war, whilst the Danes were increasing in strength and sending over for fresh forces.</P>

<P>She was the daughter of the Earl of Devon∣shire, and Edgar, unwilling to credit the great report of her beauty, sent Ethelwolfe, a friend to see her that he might be better satisfied, designing, if report spoke truth, to pay his addresses to her. This friend no sooner saw her than he became desperately in love with her, and forgetting his errand, made proposals to her himself; his hand was ac∣cepted and they were privately married: returning, how∣ever, to court and assuring the king, that she was so far from handsome that he wondered the world could speak of her, Edgar thought no more of her. Sometime afterwards he represented to the king, that though the fortune of the Earl of Devonshire's daughter would be trifting to a monarch, yet it would be an immense sum to a needy subject, and so∣licited his permission to pay his court to her. Edgar con∣senting, Ethelwolfe returned to his wife, and their nupti∣als were publickly solemnized. Now, though he had the precaution not to let her appear at court, his treachery was not long concealed, Edgar was made acquainted with the whole, but disembling his resentment, took an opportuni∣ty of visiting the part of the country where she lived. Ac∣companied by his favourite, when he was near the place, he told him he had a curiosity to see his wife, of whom he
<PB N="25" REF="30"/>had a curiosity to see his wife, of whom he had formerly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ard so much. Ethelwolfe thunderstruck, did all he could disswade him, but in vain; all he could obtain was to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> before, under pretence of preparing her for the king's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eption. He then informed his wife of the steps he had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>en to be possessed of her charms, and conjured her to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nceal her beauty as much as possible. Elfrida promised <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mpliance, but prompted either by vanity or revenge, set <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rself off to the best advantage. The king no sooner saw <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r but was smitten, and was instantly resolved to have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r. He took his leave however with a seeming indiffer∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ce. Ethelwolfe was soon after sent to Northumberland. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a pretence of urgent affairs; and, in his journey was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urdered in a wood by the king's command, who took <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>frida to court and married her. Edgar, however was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aced among the number of the saints, by the Monks, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o have written his history.</P>
<P>Ladies you see were admitted to court in this early pe∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d; but polite as the age seems to have been, there was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll a degree of savage barbarity among the people.— <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he defects of Edgar's government fell upon his successors; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e power of the Monks encreased, and that of the state Tened in proportion. Edgar died in 975, and was suc∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eded by his son Edward the Martyr, so called, because <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur years afterwards, at the age of 19, he fell a sacrifice <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the ambition of his step-mother Elfrida, who ordered <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m to be stabbed, to make way for her own son Ethel∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, II., son also of Edgar, who was crowned in his stead.</P>

The plot was carried into execution, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ost of them were destroyed in one day.

Numerous were the forces on both sides, and great was the contest. William had three horses killed under him, and lost 15000 men. Harold lost near 60,000; he was as active and brave as man could be, but was conquered after all. Making a

<P>This was a remnant of Pagan superstition, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eld in veneration by the Saxons, and was made use of to prove, whether persons accused, were innocent or guilty. <HI>Water-ordeal</HI> was confined to the lower class of people, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re-ordeal</HI> to the upper.

As these trials were sometimes allowed to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e performed by deputy, we hence derive the expression, "of going through fire and water to serve another."

Trial by battle, as

<P>William having continued 13 years in Eng∣land, now thought of re-visiting his native dominions, being established in the dukedom of Normandy, on the death of his father; but, he was no sooner gone, than a conspiracy was set on foot, carried on by the Normans as well as English. William, to gratify his followers from Normandy, had disposed of the estates of those who fell in the battle of Hastings, among them. He gave each a certain quantity of land, with all the inhabitants dwelling on that land; so that these inhabitants, were wholly at the will of their Lord, and they were called his bondmen. For this land, the Lord was obliged to arm his vassals and march out in defence of the king, whenever he pleased to call upon them; so, that each lord of a district, or baron was the head of a little army: this manner of holding lands is called, <HI>feudal tenure,</HI> and was an improvement of that state of villenage, of which I have already spoken; for at this time there was no standing army.</P>

<P>The Norman barons conceiving themselves aggrieved, carried on a secret correspondence with the kings of Denmark and Ireland, and a number of Danish forces were to invade this country, in the absence of

<P>Though good fortune seemed to mark his reign thus <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar, the decline of it was interrupted with domestic quar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣els. He had three sons, Robert, William and Henry. His eldest son Robert, encouraged by the king of France, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ade an attempt to sieze Normandy, and William, who could place no confidence but in the English, was obliged <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o use English forces to bring this unnatural son to his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uty, and it so happened by the chance of battle, that in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n engagement between the Normans and the English, William and his son, fought with each other unknowingly. The son attacked him with such fury, that his aged father <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ell to the ground with the blow, and had not William called out and his voice been recollected by his son, his death would immediately have followed; but Robert, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tung with remorse and a consciousness of duty, leaped from his horse, raised his father from the ground, fell prostate before him, begged pardon for his offences, and promised future obedience. The king moved by the im∣pulse of nature, took him once more to his arms, and both armies, spectators of this affecting scene, participa∣ted in their joy and reconciliation.</P>
<P>William did not live many years after this, he invaded France in the year 1088, with an English army, and leaping a ditch, the pummel of his saddle hurt him, and occasioned a rupture, of which he died, leaving to his son Robert the dukedom of Normandy, and the crown of England, to his son William.</P>
<P>William II. on ascending the English throne, had two very powerful parties to oppose; the nobility, who still aspired to the same freedom they possessed under the Saxon kings, and the clergy, who wished to erect themselves into a distinct government.</P>
<P>Odo, his own uncle, took upon him to dispute his title, and being supported in this by his brother Robert, Wil∣liam waged war with Robert, and carried it on with vigour and success. Henry, the third brother, was also involved in this war, having taken up arms for not being
<PB N="32" REF="37"/>paid the money his father left him. Such an unnatural contest between three brothers, ferved only to weaken themselves, and strengthen their enemies. The Scots and Welch, took this opportunity to make incursions upon the English; the clergy complained of encroachments on their privileges, the people murmured at the increase o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> taxes, and the whole country was in arms.</P>

<P>Peter, surnamed the Hermit, who had beheld with indignation, the cruel manner in which the infidels (who had possession of Christ's sepulchre in the holy land) treated the christians, who went on pilgrimage there, re∣turned to Europe, resolved to inspire the princes of christ∣endom with a zeal for it's recovery: for the christians of that age, thought it an essential part of their duty, to go to this tomb occasionally and say their prayers to God. Bare-headed and bare-footed, therefore, in the spirit of su∣perstition, he travelled from court to court, preaching as he went, and inflaming the zeal of every rank of people. Pope Urban II. himself preached the necessity of this holy war, and numberless persons of all degrees and na∣tions ardently embraced the cause, and put on the red∣cross, the badge of their profession. Among this number was Robert, duke of Normandy. In order to supply money for this expensive undertaking, he offered to mortgage his dukedom to his brother William, for a sti∣pulated sum. William, eagerly embraced the proposal. He raised the money upon the clergy of this kingdom, and when his brother was gone, took peaceable possession of his dukedom.</P>
<P>In this manner, was Normandy again united to the English crown, and from this union, afterwards arose those wars with France, which for whole centuries, continued to depopulate both nations.</P>

He was acci∣dentally shot through the heart with an arrow, by a gen∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eman hunting with him. This happened in the 44th year of his age, and in the year 1100.</P>

<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>There were now two competitors for the Throne, Robert, who was engaged in the holy war, and Henry the youngest brother, who remained at home. Henry, however, took possesion of it, and endeavoured to secure that possession, by gaining the affections of the people. He therefore once more confirmed the Saxon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aws, and indulged the clergy, in all their former privi∣leges.</P>
<P>On Robert's return from the holy land, where he re∣fused to be crowned king of Jerusalem, he found himself deprived of a kingdom, which, as elder brother to Wil∣liam, he considered as his birth-right. He could not, however, recover it, nor his dukedom of Normandy; but in his attempt was taken prisoner, and confined twen∣ty six years in Cardiff-castle, in Wales, where he died.</P>
<P>To defend his possessions in Normandy, Henry was obliged to wage war with France, and during one of the engagements a French cavalier personally attacked the king, and struck him twice on the head, with such force that all his armour streamed with blood. Henry, however, no way intimidated, continued the single combat with re∣solution, and, summoning all his strength, levelled such a blow at his antagonist as threw him from his horse, and the king took him prisoner. This decided the victory, in favour of the English, and hastened a peace.</P>
<P>Henry now returning victorious from abroad, brought with him a numerous retinue of the nobility. In one of the vessels of the fleet, his only son and several young noblemen, his companions, went together to render the voyage more agreeable. The young prince, desirous to be first a-shore, promised the seamen a reward, if they came in foremost. This emulation was fatal to them all; the pilot ran the ship upon a rock, and immediately she
<PB N="34" REF="39"/>was dashed to pieces. The prince, however, was put in∣to a boat, and would have escaped, had he not been called back by the cries of Matilda, his sister, who was married to the emperor of Germany, Henry V. and who was ther in the same ship; he prevailed upon the sailors to row back to take her in; and the approach of save their lives, several leaped in, so that the boat was over-loaded, and all except one, went to the bottom. The prince was eighteen years old. When Henry was informed of this, he cover∣ed his face and never laughed afterwards.</P>

<P>Was Matilda drowned among the rest?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>The vessel in which she was, escaped, and Matilda in it. The emperor soon after dying, she was married to Geoffrey of Plantagenet, earl of Angou; by him she had a son, named Henry. The king obliged the nobility to take an oath to support his daughter on the throne, after his decease, which they did, by observed it no longer than whilst they were obliged to obey. Hen∣ry did not long survive this, but died in the year 1135.</P>
<P>During the reign of Henry, the barons and the clergy were growing into power. each was a petty tyrant over those who held under him. In order, therefore, to con∣firm privileges so lately acquired, they joined in electing a king, who might owe his sceptre to them. They fixed on Stephen, nephew to the deceased king; and as for their oaths to Matilda, (or Maude, as she was called,) the bishops gave them an absolution.</P>
<P>The kingdom now began to wear the face of aristoracy, in which the barons and clergy might be said to command. They built castles, fortified and garrisoned them with their own troops, from whence, when offended, they would bid their monarch defiance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>And did Stephen submit to this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>He could not help himself; he opposed their measures, took some of their castles by force; but as the people were dependant on the barons, the king could make but little head against them. Matilda now claimed the crown in pursuance of her father's disposal of it. She came over from Normandy with an armed force, and took
<PB N="35" REF="40"/>possession of the castle of Arundel, in Sussex. A civil war was the consequence, a victory was obtained against the king; and though he fought with a party of the enemy with the utmost intrepidity, performing more than could be expected from a single arm, his sword flying in pieces he was obliged to surrender himself a prisoner. The con∣queror conducted him from the field and ignominiously said him in irons.</P>
<P>Matilda was now proclaimed queen but as she disdain∣ed to accept the shadow of royalty, and the barons and clergy intending to grant no more, offence was soon given. Matilda was obliged to quit England again, Stephen was released and once more placed upon the throne.</P>
<P>Stephen, like Matilda, not caring to submit to the dic∣tates of his subjects; the barons invited over Henry, Ma∣tilda's son, then twenty one years of age, who had been long acknowledged as duke of Normandy. He soon land∣ed with a formidable army, and another civil war would have ensued, had it not been agreed on by all parties, that Stephen should enjoy the crown for life, and that Henry should be his successor. Stephen's death, the year follow∣ing, soon put his rival in possession.</P>
<P>Henry Plantagenet ascending the throne of England in 1160, by hereditary succession and with the universal assent of his people; and, conscious of his strength, began to assume those privileges which had been torn from the crown, through the weakness of his predecessors.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>What steps did he take?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>He demolished the castles, dismissed all foreign troops, resumed the crown lands, and enacted some laws by which the people became, in some measure, indepen∣dent of the barons. He chartered several towns, and laid the ground-work of English liberty. Having thus dimi∣nished the power of the barons, by enlarging that of the people, he undertook to humble the clergy. He propo∣sed, that the bishops should not be permitted to go to Rome; that no subject should appeal to the Pope; that no officer of the crown, should be excommunicated, or suspended by the clergy; and, that the clergy themselves should be subject to the temporal judge. These propo∣sitions
<PB N="36" REF="41"/>were agreed to; Becket, archbishop of Canter∣bury, however, a powerful and haughty man, not caring to submit, was condemned as a traitor; but, escaped punishment, by flying his country.</P>
<P>The Pope (Alexander III.) espoused Becket's quarrel; and, after a variety of conferences and negociations; with threats and excommunications on the part of the Pope, which continued some years, Henry thought proper to acquiesce and pardon him. The archbishop then made his way into London, amidst the exclamations of the peo∣ple. He was no sooner however re-instated in his power, than he excommunicated two of the nobility, and suspended several of the bishops who had been his enemies. Com∣plaint was made to the king, then in Normandy, and four gentlemen at the instance of Henry, as is supposed, under∣took to curb his insolence: they hastened to England, entered the cathedral of Canterbury, where he was offici∣ating, and with a few attendants, beat out his brains, with clubs, at the foot of the altar.</P>
<P>His death confirmed those privileges to the clergy, which his opposition could not do. He was considered as a martyr to his cause, and to have fallen by the hand of Henry.</P>
<P>In order to divest the attention of the public from sus∣picions of this nature, Henry undertook the conquest of Ireland; a project formed some years before, but deferred on account of his long-protracted quarrel with Becket. The more readily to gain the Pope's consent to this, (for nothing then could be done without the sanction of Rome) he made oath, that he was no way concerned in the assassi∣nation of this archbishop, and made a solemn vow, to go bare-footed to Becket's tomb, and there receive the chiscipline of the church; he kept his vow, and sometime after was whipped by the Monks accordingly.</P>
<P>Having abtained the Pope's consent, he subdued Ire∣land with a rapidity equal to his wishes; but the happiness he received from this new accession of power, was soon allayed, by a conspiracy in his own family. This mo∣narch had not many vices, but gallantry was one of them. His queen was disagreeable, and Henry was faithless.
<PB N="37" REF="42"/>His amours with the fair Rosamond, whom he kept se∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>etly in Woodstock-park, were soon discovered by his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>een. She found her out, went to her and obliged her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> take poison.</P>
<P>The matter ended not here; the queen's sons took part <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> her resentment, and a conspiracy was formed, abetted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> all the malecontents in the kingdom. Henry opposed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ith his usual prudence and resolution, and seemed every <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>here victorious, but ascribing the opposition of his own children to the anger of heaven, he was resolved by an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>emplary penance, to conciliate it's favour. This pen∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ce, was going as I said, to Becket's tomb, and submitting <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> be scourged by the Monks. It did not however recon∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>le him to his family; so that he pined with grief, and, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nding his end approach, caused himself to be carried into <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e church at Chinon, in Normandy, and expired before <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e altar, with scarce a single attendant to deplore his fall.</P>

<P>Nay, he not only conquered Ireland, but, raised 300,000 l. among king of Scotland, he took him prisoner, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd made him give up the independency of his crown.</P>
<P>Henry II. was succeeded by his second son, Richard I. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> 1189. A romantic desire for strange adventures, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> immoderate zeal for the externals of christianity, were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e ruling passions of the times, and they readily became <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ose of Richard. Impressed with a desire of rescuing the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ply land from the infidels, he left England; and, with a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>umerous army, passed through France, took in his way <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e island of Cyprus, from a christian prince; landed in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>alestine; conquered Saladine, with the slaughter of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>0,000 Saracens; took several cities from the infidels, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d gained great reputation for conduct and personal bra∣very; having concluded a truce with Saladin, for three <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ears, he set sail for his return, but tempestuous weather <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>liged him to land on the coast of Italy; where, pursuing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s way homeward by land, he was taken prisoner near Vienna, by the duke of Austria, and put into the hands of the Emperor, who ungenerously detained him on the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ost frivolous pretence.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="43"/>England had been left in his absence, under the govern∣ment of two bishops, who disagreed between themselves, and thus weakened the power of the cleargy. John, the brother of Richard, took now advantage of his confine∣ment, formented this jealousy among the cleargy, and put∣ting himself at the head of the barons, encreased their authority, by the addition of his own. But the cleargy, faithful to their king, raised 300,000 l. among themselves; with this ransom procured his enlargement, and he re∣turned. His brother John, sued to him for pardon, and was generously forgiven.</P>
<P>Richard, was some time after engared in a French war, and whilst he was abroad, an insurrection took place in London, owing to a new tax which the people disliked. One William Fitz-Osborne, a lawyer, commonly called Long-beard, was their ring-leader, but the principal citi∣zens being called to arms, Long-beard was taken, convict∣ed, and, with nine of his accomplices, hanged in chains. This was the first instance of the people's rising in defence of their liberties, independent of the barons or the clergy.</P>

<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>At the siege of Chaluz, near Limoges, Richard received a wound on the shoulder, with an arrow, of which he died, after a turbulent reign of ten years.</P>
<P>The wars now kindled up between England and France, continued to depopulate both countries; and John, the brother and successor of Richard, pursued them with unabating vigour.</P>
<P>John mounted the throne, in exclusion to his nephew Arthur, duke of Bretagne, and not contented with this, he wrested his dukedom from him, also took the unfortu∣nate Arthur prisoner, confined him, and he was never heard of afterwards. John was suspected of putting him to death, and this crime opened the way to his future ruin; he was cited to Paris to answer for it, but not at∣tending, his dominions in France were taken from him and John tamely submitted to it.</P>
<P>Having thus given offence abroad, he soon did the same at home. He interfered in the election of an arch∣bishop of Canterbury, opposing the Pope's nomination,
<PB N="39" REF="44"/><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ich former kings had not done, and thus drew upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n the resentment of the clergy. The Pope excommu∣cated him, forbad his subjects longer to obey him, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ve the kingdom of the England to the king or France. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ilip, the French king, accepted the gift and prepared to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ke possession of it; whilst, on the other hand, John <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d raised army of 60,000 men, and marched to Do∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r to oppose him.

John swore to perform <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>at the Pope should propose, and this was to resign his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ngdom into the Pope's hands, which he accordingly did public in the most solemn manner.</P>

<P>No. He held it still, but as a tributary prince <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the see of Rome; that is to say, he agreed to pay a cer∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>in sum annually for the kingdoms of England and Ire∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nd, and to act in all things as the Pope should direct him. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e, by this means, saved himself from an invasion of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ng of France.</P>
<P>Thus did this king render himself contemptible in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>es of all the world. He had now only to offend the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rons, to render himself perfectly obnoxious; and this he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d not fail to do. They demanded the re-establishment <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> their ancient privileges, and John believed himself au∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>orised to resuse them, yet demanded their assistance <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> recover his lost dominions in France.

<P>This charter was, in fact, giving the barons leave to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>present to the king what they thought grievances, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d he was, in forty days, to give them satisfaction, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ey were legally impowered to command it.

<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>A power the Pope formerly claimed of depriv∣ing a person of the benefit of the laws of his country, ex∣cluding him from the bosom of the church: the ecclesia∣tical court retains the same power now, and denounces it on particular offenders. When the king was excommuni∣cated, the Pope absolved his subjects from their allegiance, forbad them to obey, and gave away his kingdom to an∣other.</P>
<P>What the Pope had formerly done, the barons thought proper to do now; they offered the crown of England to France, and Philip accepted it with joy; but, fearing the Pope's displeasure, he prevailed on the English barons to elect his son Louis. In this they agreed, and the city of London lent it's assistance. Louis landed in England with a large army, in 1216; John was deposed, and Louis was crowned at London; which so affected John's spirits that it occasioned his death the same year, in the fifty first year of his age, after having reigned seventeen years.</P>

<P>Did Louis continue king?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>No. Had Louis dissembled, till firmly seat∣ed on the throne, he might have retained the crown; but the barons wanted a monarch subservient to their power, and Louis refused a kingdom upon such conditions. He, of course, after a defeat, left England, and Henry III. the son of John, then only ten years old, was crowned in his stead, and the earl of Pembroke appointed his guar∣dian.</P>
<P>Things went on pretty well during the regency of the early of pembroke, as he kept up his interest with the cler∣gy, and thus preserved a ballanced in the state; but, no sooner was Henry of age and took the reins of govern∣ment into his own hands, than numberless insurrections and calamities were the result of his obstinacy, his folly and his vice. Infinite were the struggles of power between the barons and the king. Henry's luxury and profuseness
<PB N="41" REF="46"/>continually rendered him a petitioner to the assembly of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e barons for money, (for since the abolition of military <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rvices, kings asked money instead of soldiers,) and they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> constantly demanded a confirmation of their former pri∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>leges.</P>
<P>He found various methods, however, of raising money <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> exaction, but not sufficient to supply his wants; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e barons finding nothing could be done with him, for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e space of forty years, at last shook off their allegiance <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd sent the king notice, that they renounced the fealty <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ey owed him, and considered him only as the common <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>emy of mankind.</P>
<P>Both parties were now in arms; the country became <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gain the treatre of a civil war, and nothing was thought <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f but the decision of the sword: a battle ensued, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing and his son Edward were taken prisoners.</P>
<P>The barons and the clergy now called in the sanction <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f the people, in order to new model the constitution; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd from this time we may truely date the origin of Eng∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ish liberty. A parliament was summoned, in which the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing was obliged to give orders, that four knights from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ach country should sit, in order to represent their respec∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ive shires. This is the first rude outline of an English <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ouse of commons. The people had been gaining some consequence since the diminution of the feudal laws and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he establishment of corporations, by which men were not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o dependent on the men of land and property. As arts <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ncreased the number of corporations increased; and they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ere now so numerous as to be consulted in the legislati∣on. Had the barons and people, at this time, been una∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>imous, they might have governed the nation without a monarch; but they disagreed; another battle ensued. The king's party was victorious, and Henry and his son were restored. This was in 1265.

<P>He was succeeded in 1307, by his fourth son, Edward II. By his mal-administraction, and countenancing some favourites in opposition to the barons, he brought on a civil war; battles were fought, many noble prisoners ta∣ken on both sides, and the scaffolds were drenched with
<PB N="43" REF="48"/>English blood, the leaders of the different parties when <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>en, being instantly put to death. Edward's queen was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>oud, haughty, and revengeful woman, sister to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>g of France, and, being faithless to her husband, in∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>guing with Mortimer, earl of March, the king en∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>voured to secure him. And, on her being sent over to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nce on a negotiation, her paramour went with her; perswaded her brother to espouse her cause, and re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ned with an army, of which Mortimer was at the head, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ve the king battle, took him prisoner, deposed him, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> her son, a youth of fourteen on the throne, hanged her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>band's favourites, and took upon her the regency du∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>g her son's minority. Nothing now but the death of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ward was wanting to complete her guilt; he was sent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>m prison to prison, the sport of his mercenary keepers, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d suffered all the indignities that cruel and ingenious <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lainy could devise, and was at last very cruelly mur∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>red, in Berkeley-castle by ruffians, supposed to be em∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>yed by her and Mortimer.

<P>They did, and it is a proof in my opinion their pusillanimity; for Edward's greatest fault was the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>olence of his friendships. Edward III. however his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, when of age, punished his mother and her friend <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ortimer, for the murder of his father.

<P>Under Edward III. our parliament, the bulwark of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r constitution was reduced to a better form. A spirit <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> liberty breathes in all his laws, but no one knew how <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> make himself more absolute. He began his reign by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ducing the Scots to the most distressful situation, and, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ce more obliged them to acknowledge their dependence <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n the crown of England: but his attention was soon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rawn off to objects of greater moment. On the death <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f Charles, king of France, who left a young wife with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hild, there being no apparent heir, the next heir to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rown was to be regent, and this office Edward III. as
<PB N="44" REF="49"/>the grandson of a king of France, by his mother's fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> claimed, in preference to Philip Valois, the next he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> by the male line. Philip's claims were admitted; and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> widowed queen being brought to bed of a daughter, Phi∣lip was elected king. Edward therefore disputed th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> crown, and invaded France with a powerful army.</P>
<P>On Edward's landing, Philip challenged-him to fing<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> combat and Edward accepted it, but some obstacles in∣tervening the war was prosecuted in the usual manner<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> many skirmishes took place which at last drew on the de∣cisive battle of Cressy, that every honest Englishman boas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of to this hour. Philip was at the head of 100,000 me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and Edward only of 30,000, the first line of whose ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> was commanded by Edward's son, called the black prince (from his black hair) a youth of fifteen years of age. The valour of this lad filled even veterans with astonish∣ment, and to him the success of the day was committed. In short, the English were victorious, 30,000 French were slain, and not 100 English. Edward in his way home took the town of Calais, of which the English kept pos∣session 210 years.</P>
<P>Whilst the English were thus employed abroad, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> king of Scots took the opportunity and invaded England The queen in the absence of her husband marched at th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> head of a large army northwards, gave the Scots batth and took their king prisoner.</P>

Such steps must naturally cre∣ate not only horror but disgust in the people, at the seve∣rities of such a government.

He, for this purpose, invaded France with 50,000 men, but an epidemic disorder carried off three fourths of his soldiers. Reduced now to 9000 men, he was opposed by a French army of 150,000: this dis∣parity of number, however, did not discourage Henry. The two armies met at Agincourt, and the English, being resolved either to conquer or die, fell upon the enemy with such impetuosity, that they soon routed them. Hen∣ry alighted from his horse and fought at the head of his men, on foot; eighteen french cavaliers resolving either to kill him or fall in the attempt, rushed on him at once, and one of them stunned him with the blow of a battle-ax,

<P>Edward left two sons, the eldest of whom, a boy be∣tween twelve and thirteen, was proclaimed king, in 1483, and his mother, who, lately raised among the nobility, wished to hide her want of rank among a new promotion, was for having a number of peers created. This gave offence to the old nobility, and Richard, duke of Gloces∣ter, the king's uncle, who was of a tyrannical disposition, fomented their discontents. Having shewn the danger of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>etting the queen have the government in her hands, he procured himself to be chosen protector of the realm, and thus got possession of the young king and his brother the duke of York, a child about seven years of age; whom <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nder a pretence of providing for their safety, he sent prisoners to the tower.</P>

<P>Glocester had no sooner secured their persons, but he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>asterdized them by act of parliament, and, by pretended <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bstacles, put off the young king's coronation.

<P>From the accession of Henry VII. to the throne of this country, the whole government seems to have put on a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ew form. If he was not the greatest prince, he was by far the most useful one that ever reigned. A nation of tu∣mult was reduced through him to a civil subordination;
<PB N="56" REF="61"/>an insolent and factious aristocracy was humbled; wise laws were enacted, commerce restored, and peace and happiness introduced to a people little better than in a state of barbarism for thirteen hundred years before.</P>
<P>Henry's first care was to marry the princess Elizabeth, daughter of Edward IV. thus uniting the interests of the houses of Lancaster and York. He has been accused of avarice, but perhaps unjustly so. Before his reign, it was usual, for high treason, to take away the life of the aggress∣or and give away his fortune to some court favourite. This, Henry perceived had two bad effects, it excited re∣sentment by it's cruelty, and made a favourite too power∣ful for subjection; to avoid this he deprived such as were taken in arms of their property, and reserved it for the use of the crown. He was a great economist, which en∣abled him not only to be useful to the poor, but just to his own creditors.</P>
<P>Immediately after his marriage, he issued out a general pardon to all who would accept of it, but those who flew to arms were quelled, and some of the ring-leaders exe∣cuted.</P>
<P>Sagacious however as Henry was, he was jealous of his power, and though the earl of Warwick, a son of the duke of Clarence, Edward the IVth's brother, was only a boy, and nothing alledged against him, still as he was related to the house of York, he shut him up a close prisoner in the tower. This youth was however made an instru∣ment to deceive the people. A priest of Oxford, had trained up one Lambert Simnel, a baker's son, to coun∣terfeit the person of this earl, and having prepared him for his purpose, he sat out for Ireland, and there opened the scene. The plot unfolded to his wish, Simnel was re∣ceived and proclaimed king, and was conducted by the people and officers of state, with great pomp to the castle.</P>

<P>What could have induced this priest to play off this trick?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was a scheme of the queen dowager's to dispossess Henry of the crown; for which, she was con∣fined in a monastery, where she remained many year till she died. To get rid however of this imposture, Henry
<PB N="57" REF="62"/><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rdered the earl of Warwick, who was still a prisoner in the tower, to be led publickly through the streets of Lon∣don, to convince the people of the deception. But this did not answer the purpose; Simnel being joined by some of the discontented party came over to England, and marched to York. The people here did not join him, and the king giving him battle, Simnel's party was de∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eated, and he himself taken prisoner. Henry had too <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uch greatness of mind, to put him to death, but ap∣pointed him to a mean office in his service, in which post <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e died. As for the priest his instructor, he was made a prisoner for life.</P>
<P>All things being thus adjusted, Henry, laid a design of recovering his French dominions, by an attack upon France, and the parliament furnished him with supplies for that purpose; but, when the money came to be col∣lected, it occasioned a new insurrection, and the earl of Northumberland, in attempting to enforce obedience to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he laws, was killed by the mob in Yorkshire. The mu∣tineers did not stop here, but, by the advice of one John∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>-Chambre, marched towards London, to give the king battle; and the consequence was a defeat and the death of their ring-leader, who was executed upon the occasion.</P>
<P>Scarce was this matter ended, but the old duchess of Burgundy, sister to Edward IV. set on foot another im∣postor. She first spread a report that the duke of York, Edward IVth's second son, was not murdered in the tow∣er, as was said, but was still alive; and then pitched upon a genteel young man, the son of a Flemish Jew, to personate him. At the desire of the duchess, the king of France received him, but afterwards at Henry's re∣quest discountenanced him.</P>
<P>Henry took some pains to shew the people the fallacy of this, by proving that the duke of York was dead, and punishing his murderers, and by tracing the impostor, whose name was Perkin Warbeck, to his original obscu∣rity; but so determined was the king's enemies to dis∣possess him of the crown, that nothing could interrupt their design. Warbeck landed in Kent, but was soon driven off again by the inhabitants. He went from thence
<PB N="58" REF="63"/>to Ireland, and next to Scotland, where James IV. ki<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of that country received him, acknowledged his prete<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣sions, and gave him in marriage one of his kinswomen a daughter of the earl of Huntley, and, by marching a army into England, made another attempt to set him o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the throne. James however not finding the country <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in his cause, retired into Scotland, and obliged Perkin <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> seek for a new protector.</P>

<P>If he was not the duke of York, he certain was very well instructed; but there are historians w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> say, that he and his brother Edward V. were clandestine sent abroad, that Edward V. died, but that his brother survived, and was the same who was afterwards known <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the name of Perkin Warbeck.

There was at this time also an insurrection Cornwall, under one Flammoc, a lawyer, in opposition to some taxes that were levying by act of parliament, and as every insurrection now was followed with a project dethroning the king, the insurgents marched to London and encamped at Black-heath, where the king's for<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> surrounded and defeated them.

<P>Why did you so extol the character of Henry?</P>

<P>Because he was fond of peace, and seemed to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ave the interest of his people at heart.

<P>The first act of injustice which marked hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> reign, was the prosecution and execution of Empson an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Dudley, two judges, whom his father had appointed t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> enquire into cases of treason, and levy fines in proportio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to the offence.

<P>Yes, by her cousin Mary, queen of France and Scotland, and this lady's cause was supported by the popish faction: but it ended in the fall of Mary, for when her husband, the king of France, died, she came over to England, where, by a breach of hospitality, Eli∣zabeth

<P>Very little. Elizabeth had a great deal of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t and cunning, and contrived, by somenting disputes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on the continent and setting the states there at variance <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ong each other, to divert their attention in a great mea∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>re from this kingdom.

<P>What relation was James to Elizabeth?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Third cousin. James was the son of Mary, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d Mary was the grand-daughter of Elizabeth's aunt, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e sister of Henry VIII. Thus were the two countries of England and Scotland united under one monarch.</P>
<P>King James came to the throne with the universal appro∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ation of all orders of the state, for in his person was unit∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> every claim to the crown, that either descent, bequest, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> parliamentary sanction could confer.</P>

<SP>

<P>He made an attempt to invade England with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> army, but policy soon induced him to drop it, England <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing too powerful at that time. However, when he came

<P>James began his reign by labouring to unite both king∣doms into one, but the jealousy of the English put a st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> to it for the present, lest the offices in the English co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> and government should be disposed of to Scotchmen.</P>

<P>Yes; and James wished to govern his Eng∣lish subjects in the same way he did his Scotch ones, whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> occasioned numberless disputes between the king and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> parliament.

<P>There was.

For this deed of desperation number of persons united, and how horrid soever the co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣trivance, every member seemed faithful and secret in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> league; every thing was prepared to their wishes, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> conspirators expected the day with impatience.

<P>It was. For though no monarch ever came <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the throne of England with a greater variety of fa∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>urable occurrences, yet, as his father had considered the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>yal privileges as sacred pledges, and defended them to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> utmost of his power by words, it was Charles's mis∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rtune to assert them by action. He wanted to govern <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> people, who had for some time, learned to be free, by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>axims and precedents that had their origin in times of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>norance and slavery.

From small <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ides he proceeded to greater, and when the parliament <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>und, that the king was disposed to be arbitrary, they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ere determined to grant no supplies, or raise him any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oney, till their grievances were redressed.</P>

<P>Some few years only; for he was naturally of a feeble constitution: his death was hastened by fall from his horse, in March, 1702; and he was succeeded by Anne, the next daughter of James II.

<P>He had two sons and several daughters.

George II. died suddenly, in October, 1760, aged seventy-six, after reigning thirty two years, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd was succeeded by his grandson, our present king, son of Frederick, prince of Wales. To acquaint you with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he many occurrences of this reign, as they are chiefly
<PB N="76" REF="81"/>within your own memory, would be useless. I shall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> mention to you the loss of our colonies in America.</P>
<P>In the year 1765, an act was passed here for laying stamp-duty on the British Colonies of North America which the people there thought an infringement on the privileges; as by their charters they claimed a right raising the quota they were obliged to pay towards <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> support of government, in their own way; for they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> assemblies or parliaments of their own as we have. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> soon as it was known in North American that this act <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> passed, the whole continent was in a flame, and all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> stamped paper sent over was burnt as soon as land<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> When the minister here was informed of this, they ga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the matter up, and an act was passed to repeal the one th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> was so obnoxious, and all things were quiet again. B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a year or two after, the British parliament, not being abl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to lay an absolute duty or tax on any commodity sent on to America, as this would be raising money on the people without their own consent, attempted to affect the same thing in another way; for, to enable the East-India com∣pany to pay the state a large annual tribute, they allowe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> them to export their teas duty-free. The Americans, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> ware of this contrivance, opposed it unanimously, burn all the tea there imported, and in 1773 boarded sever<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> ships in Boston harbour and threw the cargoes of tea in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the water.</P>
<P>This conduct excited so much indignation in the govern∣ment of England, that they proceeded to rigorous mea∣sures: they blocked up the port of Boston and would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> suffer it to have any trade. The Americans now combin∣ed, raised an army, and a civil war was the consequence. This was continued to the year 1783, when it ended <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the sovereignty and independence of that country; an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was the greatest loss this nation ever sustained.</P>

<P>You are no longer, my dear Eugenius, in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> infant state of life, when man is too weak to listen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the voice of reason; you are sixteen years of age, time when the mind begins to open, and form a judg∣ment of what it sees; a time when young men <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> capable of perceiving and knowing what is to con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣tute their well-being. Could I have the happine<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> my friend, to make you sensible from this moment the value of a good education, how estimable m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>

What is it that distinguishes one man from other, but his capacity and knowledge? Does not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e ignorant man, he who has no talent, no acquisi∣on, resemble the brute beast, who knows only how <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> eat, to drink and to sleep? Whereas he who has understanding and knowledge, is distinguished every <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>here, he is useful to himself and to society, and is an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onour to human nature. Whilst neglect and contempt <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er accompanies him who is devoid of merit, the man <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f understanding has a thousand advantages, and is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>evered and respected by all who know him.</P>

Hitherto in our walks we have discoursed of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rifles and a thousand indifferent things that answered <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut little purpose; in future our conversations shall be more interesting, more instructive, and at the same <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ime, far more agreeable.</P>

<P>You are right.

But tell me, why are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ey not called man as well as us, since they are born, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow, and die like us?</P>

<P>Because they are not endowed with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ason.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>True. It is reason that essentially dis∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>guishes us from brutes, but what is it that dis∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>guishes man and brutes from all these plants; from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is tree, for example, which lives and grows like us, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d like that colt that bounds across the meadow?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know no difference, unless it be that I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d that animal utter sounds, run, jump, whereas the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ee neither speaks nor moves.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>But this stone which I touch with my foot equally dumb and immoveable, and yet it is neither tree nor a plant. Learn then the principal difference between a brute, a plant, and a stone. The brute <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es and at the same time has certain senses, the plant <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es also, but has no sense, and as to the stone, it has <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>either life nor sense.</P>
<P>We have in common with the brutes the natural <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nses of the body; for example, sight, smell, hear∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>g, tasting, and feeling; and, in general, in animals <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ey are more delicate than in man. The cat has a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>etter sight, the dog a better scent, and the hare a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reater power of hearing. The plant has nothing in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ommon with man and brute but life, that is to say, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>egetation. The stone has nothing in common with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ther one or the other but the substance or matter of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hich it is composed. We are formed from the dust <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f the earth, and to that dust we shall return.</P>
<P>Let us look into ourselves now. God alone has made us what we are. Were we to examine the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ructure of our bodies, we should find, that the mi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>utest part of us is finely formed to answer the purpose or which it was designed. Our whole frame is such an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>xquisite piece of mechanism, as no human art could
<PB N="6" REF="87"/>complete. Could we see our internal make, we should stand much more amazed, than we do in examining t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> work of a watch; and to the curious, philosophic ey<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> we should appear as much more beautiful than we na<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> rally are, as the inside of a watch is more beautiful th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> when covered with its cases. God having then forme<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> us as we are, had he pleased, he could have continue<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> us in our original nothingness; but he thought prope<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to draw us forth, and place us here upon the earth among milions of objects of which the earth is fu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>▪ He has, in short, made us man. And what is th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> human individual? Is he not the most noble creat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> that has issued from the hand of the Almighty? Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> only animal that reasons, thinks, can reflect upon itself and raise its mind even to the author of its being in a word, is he not the monarch of all that exists: Have you ever attended to that pre-eminence of m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> over all the other objects of nature?

<P>Is it sufficient to be sensible of the to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣vantages God has given us? Is there nothing owing to the giver of them?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly, Sir; our gratitude and than<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> are due to him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>We not only owe him gratitude, but a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> our love; and as we receive every good gift from him to whom should we apply in any of our wants but to him? Hence then the necessity of our religious duties it is our duty not only to thank him, and to hono<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> him, but also to pray to him. In performing this duty we do no more than what is right, than what good sense and the sentiments of the heart point out: na<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> were we placed here on earth, merely as the brut<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to live and die, and without any other hope, we shou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> equally owe a homage to the Divinity, for endow in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> us with reason and making us so much superior <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="7" REF="88"/><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>her animal; but when we come to consider the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>any acts of kindness our Creator has bestowed upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, we should fail in our duty, if we did not give him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> all our heart and all our love. But is there nothing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e that distinguishes us from brutes?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>We have a soul that shall never die.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>There lies the pre-eminence that chiefly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arks the difference between men, and brutes and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ery other animal on the face of the earth. Our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>odies, which are merely organized earth, will share <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e fate of other animals, but the more noble part of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s, the soul, is ordained to live for ever. Now, why <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s God given us this immortal soul? How ought it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> be attended to? You cannot be ignorant of this; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ou must remember the many lessons on this subject <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ou have been taught in your childhood; but I wish to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow what consequences you draw from the reflection, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at though the body be born to die, the soul will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ever die.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>It seems natural to conclude, that we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ught to live well, since the soul after death, will be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ernally happy or unhappy, according to our conduct <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> this life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, my friend: you enter perfectly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nto my ideas. I am charmed to find you compre∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>end, that man is born for an end worthy of himself. This is the point I am at. Nothing is more impor∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ant <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ant than to think of one's latter end. St. Bernard <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sed frequently to say to himself, "Bernard, for what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nd did you come into the world?" And surely, an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ternity of happiness or misery is no trifling matter. He who does not study it, is little else than a mad man. Yes, my dear Eugenius, to live, as if we were not to die, or as if we had nothing after death either <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o hope or to fear, is the height of blindness; it is to forget that we are men; it is, in short, to debase our∣selves below the brute creation. Under the want of such a thought, the state of brutes would be the most preferable; for if they have nothing to hope for after death, they have nothing to apprehend; so that all they do in life is indifferent: but man is capable of good and evil, and you find that it is not a matter of
<PB N="8" REF="89"/>indifference to him, for if he acts well, he will be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣warded eternally, if ill, he will be punished. T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the essential business of man, during his short stay <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> earth, is reduced to the necessity of living well. Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> world is to him merely a place of passage, and is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣inn in his journey to the next; and it is in this ro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> through life that he is to take care not to lose his wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> fince if through misfortune he has taken the wro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> road, he is loft without recovery.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Men should therefore be extremely ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦tious and enquire the right road before they proce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> upon their journey, and when on it submit to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> calamity that may befal them, rather than be put o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of their way.</P>

<P>Nothing is more true. I deplore the fate those thoughtless parents who have not discharged <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is sacred duty.

They are not only the cause of sending broad into the world, as many bad members of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ociety as they have children, but it is probable that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ose bad children, will also neglect the education <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f their descendants, and from this unfortunate pro∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ression, a multitude of bad citizens may arise from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he neglect of their ancestors.

One he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ndulged in every thing, the other he inured to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hace. When age had strengthened their bodies and confirmed them in what they had been accustomed to, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e brought them out into a public place in presence of all the citizens, whom he had convened together, and having set before these two dogs some dressed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ood, he turned loose a hare before them. One of the two dogs immediately fell to devouring the meat to which he had been accustomed, the other set off after the hare, which it presently caught. All the people applauded his design. When Lycurgus ad∣dressing the assembly, said thus, "These two dogs

<P>OF all the truths, my dear Eugenius which religion teaches, the first and the rest, is the knowledge of a Supreme Being, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Author and Creator of all things.

<P>Nothing seems more easy, Sir. When I see a fine building, I say to myself, this superb edifice has been erected with great order and regularity.

<P>You reason right. To be convinced of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e existence of a sovereign Wisdom, it is sufficient <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> open our eyes and look about us.

<P>This is one of the best remarks I have heard upon the subject, and convinces me, I shall not lose my time and labour in endeavouring to improve you. Let us then enquire into the nature of God, as far as our capacities will carry us: but at best we can have but a very imperfect idea of him; and we can know no more of his attributes, than he has conde∣scended to discover in the Old and New Testaments, which are the writings of inspired authors, dictated by God himself, and as such are the precious depo∣sites of our faith.</P>
<P>Now, the attributes are there declared to be, that he is <HI>independant,</HI> that is, that he is self-existent, de∣riving his existence from no other being; that he is <HI>eternal,</HI> that is to say, that he never had a beginning, nor ever will have an end. That he is <HI>infinite;</HI> by this we mean, that he has an unlimited power, and possesses all imaginable perfections in a sovereign de∣gree; that he is a <HI>pure Spirit,</HI> having neither body,
<PB N="12" REF="93"/>figure, nor colour; of course that he cannot bel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> perceived, nor touched.</P>

<SP>

<P>Permit me, Sir, to interrupt you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> You say that God has neither body nor figure, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> then is mention made of his hands and feet? Ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it said that he appeared to the patriarchs?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Man being limited in his understandi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> was the Deity not described to him in terms <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> which he is acquainted, he could have no concept of what is told him. It is for this reason that st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> terms are made use of; and when we are told in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> scriptures that God spoke and shewed himself to m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> we are to understand, that it was an angel only w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> descended in the name of the Most High, and appear in human form, to communicate to men the orders the Supreme Being.</P>
<P>Another attribute of the Deity is <HI>immensity,</HI> th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is to say, he fills all space, and is at one and the fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> moment, in all parts of the universe, confined to no par∣ticular spot or place.</P>
<P>He is also <HI>immutable,</HI> that is, not subject to chang<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪ If it be said in the Scriptures, that God is angry, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that he repents; we are not to understand by thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> passion or change; but these so described to us, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> we may comprehend them.</P>
<P>He knows all, both the present, the past, and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> future, nothing is hid from him, and he penetrates th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> very thoughts of the heart.</P>
<P>He is <HI>Almighty,</HI> for he would cease to be God, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his power was not immense and absolute.</P>
<P>He has drawn from nothing every thing that exis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> and that by the sole act of his will. "Let there b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Light," said he "and there <HI>was</HI> light."</P>
<P>He preserves all creatures, and guards their ex∣istence continually, for if he ceased to support them they would sink into that nothingness from whence h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> first formed them.</P>
<P>In short, nothing happens in this world without hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> order and permission. God then disposes all the event<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the world. The smallest action of every creature, the least thought of the mind, is all regulated by his
<PB N="13" REF="94"/><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ite wisdom. And in this administration, this go∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ment of the universe, which seems to us so im∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ose, but which to him cost far less trouble than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>king of the eye to us, he had no other object in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> than the manifestation of his glory to all created <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>gs.</P>

<P>But, Sir, of God consulted only his glory <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ll that passes here, why does he permit, for ex∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>le, the many disorders which reign among men?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>He permits evil, to draw from it a greater <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d.

<P>Clearly. But there is one thing that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>barrasses me much in this account. It is not said <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>t God gave a soul to Eve as he did to Adam. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ve women therefore no souls?</P>

<P>It was not necessary that the Scriptures <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>uld say so.

<P>Be cautious how you give into this. It certainly true that a great number of women have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>t faculties equal to a like number of men, but this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ference rises, not from the nature of the soul, but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>m want of equal education, and from the delicacy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> their frame.</P>
<P>The education of girls is very much neglected, par∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ularly among the better sort of people. Instead of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>plying to study, their time is spent in trifles, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>curious idleness, which enervates their mind, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>akens their bodies. And what is the result? They <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ow what they ought to be ignorant of, and are norant of what they ought to know. But let us pro∣ed on the subject we were upon.</P>
<P>After the creation of the man and the woman, God, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o formed them only to make them happy, placed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>em in a delightful garden, where nature seemed to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ve collected all her riches.

The cul∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>vation of this garden, whilst man continued innocent, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> as not a work of labour, (as the earth produced every <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing spontaneously, that is, of itself) but a sweet and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>anquil employ, which varied every instant and fur∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>shed them with motives to adore and praise the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>unty of the Creator. Blessed with the natural lights <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> which man is capable, we do not trace in Adam

<P>To give them an opportunity of desen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ing, by their obedience, the happiness he designe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for them; and remark the goodness of the Lord eve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> in this prohibition.

<P>Guilt stared them immediately in t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> face; they became instantly sensible of their crim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> and God, to punish their disobedience, told the m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> that the earth should henceforth produce thorns a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>∣briers,

<P>I will explain it then.

<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Exactly so. Man originally lived <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> hunter state, and depended upon his bow for daily subsistance; so that it required an exten<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> district of land to maintain a tribe of men; for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not a small spot that will maintain a number people, who are to live upon wild animals taken <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> hunting. As men therefore grew populous, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> encreased in number, they found it necessary to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣tivate land, in order to procure them food; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> cultivation, led on to society, for when they bec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> possessed of property, it was necessary to guard <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> property from encroachments.

<P>Not a very finished one; but we can cer∣tainly discern among the professors of these arts, those who have studied, and have been better instructed than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>thers.

<P>Pray make me acquainted with the names <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the sciences.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Of all the sciences, the most essential i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> moral philosophy, that is to say, the science that teache<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> us the duties of religion and those of society. We live my dear Eugenius, but to die. Judge then of the importance of morality, which teaches us how to live well, so that we may die well. But there are other sciences still, which are not only useful, but entertain∣ing. We will run through them as you seem to wish it.</P>
<P>We will begin with Writing; which, indeed, is rather one of the liberal arts; it is truly the art of painting words, and of speaking to the eyes, and is one of the finest inventions of man. To read well, is also very useful. Good reading is, as it were, a comment upon the subject, it explains it as it goes on. Besides to read ill is a mark of want of education, and nothing is so vulgar; it looks as if we did not understand what we read.</P>
<P>A principal perfection in writing is orthography. Can you tell me in what this consists?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is to spell the words right.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is. To write correctly and grammatically, to spell the words properly, and use right stops, is a mark of good sense and a good education. It is the first thing we judge by. Now the best way to acquire this, is to accustom ourselves to copy, with attention, some pages of a book correctly printed. Nothing serves more to mark a gentleman and man of understanding, than a proper choice of words. This is chiefly acquired by reading, but to assist on this subject, let me recom∣mend you to a book I have published for the pur∣pose, it points out THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN WORDS ESTEEMED SYNONIMOUS in the English lan∣guage, and will be found of use to such as wish to speak or write with propriety and elegance.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sold by <HI>R. Baldwin,</HI> Paternoster-Row, price three shillings and sixpence.</NOTE></P>
<P>Another knowledge as necessary as writing, is, Arith∣metic, without which a tradesman cannot carry on his
<PB N="27" REF="108"/>business; and a gentleman is liable to be cheated every day. In arithmetic lies the whole art of calculation. There is, indeed, another method of calculating, and a much shorter one, I mean Algebra, but it is very diffi∣cult and but little used.</P>
<P>Will you know what is taught at the Univer∣sities?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall be happy to hear; but first explain to me the nature of a University.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>A University is a seminary, or school, for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>earned men, and such as every wise government thinks right to establish within their dominions. Some coun∣tries have many, some fewer. England has two, Oxford and Cambridge; Scotland has four, Edin∣burgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen, and St. Andrews; and Ireland has one, established at Dublin. Each of these Universities consists of one or more colleges, with cer∣tain endowments. Government having granted them charters, with certain privileges, large sums of money have been given from time to time by well disposed persons, to found certain houses or colleges in those <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>owns. In Oxford there are twenty colleges, in Cam∣bridge sixteen, in Dublin but one. Each of these col∣leges are, through noble contributions of the rich, in possession of estates sufficient to maintain a certain number of persons called Fellows, who live together in society, and who employ themselves in educating young men, either in law, physic, or divinity. Such as go there for study, pay for their education, and to en∣courage persons to send their sons to these places, there are certain privileges annexed to those on whom the Universities shall be pleased to confer a degree or mark of distinction. A clergyman cannot hold two livings unless he has taken the degree of Master of Arts, or Batchelor of Laws, in one of our Universities; nor can he be made a bishop, until he has taken a Doctor's degree; so likewise in physic. A physician cannot practice as such, until he has taken the degree of a Doctor of physic. And before these degrees are given, the candidates for those honours are examined as to their proficiency in the science they profess.</P>

<P>It is a very laudable institution. I have heard of Doctors of Music; what are they?</P>
</SP>

<P>Music and poetry are held there a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> sciences, and degrees are occasionally given in both. The degree of Doctor of Laws is rather an honorary degree, and is frequently given to noblemen and other great personages as a compliment. There is a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> certain discipline observed in the Universities, and they govern by laws of their own.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>What are the chief studies there?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Besides the general studies of Law, Physic and Divinity, they give lectures in Algebra, Mathema∣tics, Astronomy, Natural Philosophy, Rhetoric, and Logic.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Will you be kind enough to explain them separately.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Algebra I have already mentioned.</P>
<P>Mathematics is the science which contemplates what∣ever is capable of being numbered or measured.</P>
<P>Astronomy is the study of the heavenly bodies.</P>
<P>Natural Philosophy is the science of nature. It explains the elements, Air, Earth, Fire, and Water, and searches into their causes and effects. You see how extensive this branch of science is, it includes mathematics and mechanics, it comprehends all that respects powers or strength, extent, measures, weights, and the machines employed in different arts.</P>
<P>Rhetoric explains all the figures of beauties of lan∣guage, and serves to give it more energy or more grace; it teaches us the difference of style, and how to vary it according to the subject matter. In short, it is the art of oratory; whereas Logic is the art of close reasoning.</P>

<P>Besides the living languages, such as French, Spanish, Dutch, and so on, there are the dead languages, Hebrew, Greek, and Latin; called <HI>dead,</HI> from not being perfectly spoken any where.</P>
<P>Jurisprudence is the science of the laws.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="110"/>Physic. Under this head, we include Anatomy, the structure of the human body; Surgery, the art of am∣putation and healing wounds; Chemistry, or the art of decom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sing bodies proper for the use of medicine, or of dividing, mixing, and purifying different metals; Botany, or the study of plants; and Pharmacy, the art of composing medicines.</P>
<P>Geography shews the situation of countries and the use of maps.</P>
<P>Geometry is the art of measuring.</P>
<P>Heraldry is that of knowing the arms of noble fami∣lies, towns and kingdoms.</P>
<P>Politics is the science of princes and ministers, and, indeed, is the whole art of government.</P>
<P>Fortification is the science of defending towns against the assault of an enemy.</P>
<P>Gunnery is the science of artillery; teaching the me∣thod of using cannon, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Tactics is the science of the army.</P>
<P>Navigation, that of equipping and conducting vessels upon the sea.</P>
<P>The Manage is the science of horsemanship;</P>
<P>Agriculture, the art of cultivation;</P>
<P>Architecture, the art of building;</P>
<P>Music, the science of composing tunes and pieces of music, and</P>
<P>The Belles Lettres, which is polite literature, viz. Poetry, History, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Economy is the science of adapting our outgoings to our incomes, and regulating our domestic expences.</P>

<P>And why?</P>

<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>You do not know then that wheat is the most essential of all merchandise, being the first neces∣sary? What would become of the inhabitants of a city if those if the country were to discontinue bringing wheat to market for only six weeks? There would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> no bread. The poor would die with hunger, and the rich would be embarrassed with their money; they could not eat gold and silver. You may judge from this of the benefits we derive from agriculture; and know, that of all merchandise, the necessaries of life an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> powerfully interested to encourage the commerce o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> corn, for the more open and unrestrained that commerc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is, the more likely are towns to be populous and flou∣rishing; whereas, if cities had no corn market, the would soon be deserted; grass would grow in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="31" REF="112"/>streets, and the inhabitants would be more miserable than the villagers themselves; but let us go on. We shall come presently to the beast market.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is the chicken market I apprehend. What a quantity of fowls of all sorts! chickens, turkies, ducks, poultry ready for the spit, eggs, butter, cheese, fruit, and vegetables in abundance?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thus are towns supplied with provisions. Take notice what a variety of articles we draw from the country. How much do we owe to the industry and care of the husbandman who procures us such things as we could not well do without! But this sale of pro∣visions even assists those to live who live in the neigh∣bourhood of towns. They are all brought to be con∣verted into money.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is it not right that they should profit by the fruit of their labours? We ought to be obliged to them, even though we pay them, for they work for us as well as for themselves. But let us pass to the beast market. I see a prodigious multitude of horses, cows, sheep, and pigs. What a crowd of people there is about them! Is it a good thing, Sir, to have such large markets of cattle?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly: The better a market is served, the greater the variety; we can then have such cattle as we want, and such as please us best. Every person here in laying out his money, helps the tradesman and artist to live; for those who receive money for the pro∣visions they bring to market, lay it out again in the same town, for the necessaries and conveniences they want.</P>
<P>To accommodate the people in all towns is the reason of establishing markets once or twice a week; and besides these stated days weekly, there are particular markets at certain times of the year, called Fairs: These fairs are authorised by government, and are established for the benefit of the neighbourhood where they are held, and for the convenience of selling that merchan∣dise that is produced in the places round about. For example, some fairs are considerable for the sale of horses; others for horned cattle, or sheep; others for cheese, for linens, and other things, according to the manufactures in the countries where they are held. At
<PB N="32" REF="113"/>Chester there is a great fair annually for Irish linen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> brought over there by the manufacturers from Ireland▪ These fairs, or free markets, by the certain privileg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> they have, by the abundance and great choice of mer∣chandise they furnish, and by the concourse of people they bring together, animate commerce, and occasion a great circulation of money.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have seen wakes, in the North of England, where there has been nothing bought or sold.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>But wakes are not fairs. A wake is annu∣ally held on the feast of the dedication of the parish church, that is, on the day the church was consecrated; and on these festivals every house-keeper keeps an open table and welcome every comer. All sorts of rural amusements go forward on these days, but it is a day of pleasure and not a day of business.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Will you stop here much longer?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; we will go on to the navigable canal.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>What a number of boats there are there! Was the canal made on purpose for them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was. A single river, which nature alone has formed, is not, in general, so strait nor so conve∣nient for the passage of boats. Rivers generally wind a great deal, and have a number of shallow places that are difficult to pass; besides, rivers do not always run from town to town as these canals are made to do. Here the banks are made for the purpose of horses to draw the barges along, and with wharfs for the convenience of loading and unloading them. See how the merchandise is ranged in different places; timber, firewood, bricks, paving stones, sand, coals, and other things which are here to be conveyed away in waggons to the places they are going to.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Canals then are very beneficial to a town?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very much so. Towns where there is a port as well as a canal, that is, where a navigable river joins it, flourish very much, for such rivers bring a variety of things from the sea and other places out of the reach of a canal, and commerce in such a town is much more extended.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>How is this, pray?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Transporting of merchandise by water is
<PB N="33" REF="114"/>much less expensive and more convenient than convey∣ing it by land. There now is a boat loaded with coals for this town. It is brought from the colliery or coal mine, twenty leagues from this place, and contains fifty ton weight of coals, more than forty waggons, with four horses each, can draw; and yet it is drawn upon the water by eight horses, of course here is the expence of one hundred and fity-two horses, and thirty-seven men to drive those horses saved; for three men are sufficient to conduct this boat and the eight horses that draw it. You see now how money is saved, of course the seller of the coals can afford to let his customers have them at a much less price, than if they were brought all the way by land carriage. It is the same with timber, with corn, and other merchandise con∣veyed by water; so that the carriage, if not quite so expeditious, is less expensive.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I comprehend it very well. And p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay who are at the expence of cutting these canals?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>A certain company of gentlemen. Suppose, for example, one hundred join one thousand pounds a-piece, that is, one hundred thousand pounds; this done they apply to parliament for leave to make the canal, and when parliament have passed an act for that purpose, allowing them to take passes-on it, they carry their plan into execution. So that each of these gen∣tlemen have one hundredth share in such canal, and the profit arising from the toll, after the expences of keep∣ing the banks, &amp;c. in repair, is divided among them, in proportion to their shares. By which means they get often a large interest for the use of the money so advanced; and they can sell their shares at any time. Turnpike roads are made by the same means, and the toll paid at the gates is the property of the persons who contribute to make the road. Before turnpikes were made, the roads were impassible; no one there∣fore should grudge a few pence for the convenience of good roads. Turnpikes are now made from town to town all over the kingdom, and, in process of time, canals will be as general. But if you would see a com∣mercial scene indeed, you must go to a sea-port.</P>

<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I suppose so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>You would there see a number of people <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> all countries, and speaking different languages; vessel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of various structures and different nations; some moore<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in the port, others coming in, others hoisting their sails to go out. French vessels, English, Dutch, Swedish, Russia, Spanish, Portuguese, &amp;c. There are vessels tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> carry from fifty tons burthen to six hundred; that is t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> say, large and small; that will carry a greater or a le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> quantity of merchandise. Each ton is twenty hundre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> pounds weight. In one place upon the stocks are ship<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> building, in others, upon the beach, ships laying on one side to be repaired. Every ship has its sails, its cordage, its anchors, its boats, in short, every apparatus neces∣sary to navigation. Manning a vessel for sea, is putting on board a number of men sufficient to navigate her, and a pilot to conduct her out of port. All these men have p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ticular offices, from the captain to the cabin boy. There are ships of war and merchant ships. The first belong to the state, and are employed for the defence of the kingdom and its colonies, and for the protection of the merchant ships; the latter belong to particular merchants or trading companies, such as the East India Company, the South Sea Company, and others. It is with such trading vessels that they run over all the known seas with merchandise, and from one part of the globe to another.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>How is a ship directed upon the sea?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>By her rudder, which is a board fixed at the stern or tail of the ship, under water, upon hinges, and moves to the right or to the left; if moved to the left, by the action of the water against it, it will turn the head of the ship to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight; if moved to the right, it turns the ship to the le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>. This rudder is directed by a handle upon deck, which the pilot moves at his pleasure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>And how do they know which way to go when ought of fight of land?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Out at sea they are directed by the compass, of which I will give you some day a more particular description. It is like the hand of a dial that always turns to the north; this is placed before the person who
<PB N="35" REF="116"/>steers directs the ship, and as the ship moves, this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>and moves, and points out whether the vessel is going <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts right course: for as it is known in what part of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ompass the place lies to which the vessel is bound, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat is to say, whether the port they are going to, be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orth, south, or so on, the compass will always direct <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hem to that port, by directing the ship so as that the hand shall point north, south, or to that part of the globe to which it is bound; near the coasts they are directed by sea marks; trees, or steeples planted or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erected on high grounds for the purpose, and at night by light-houses, that is, towers with fires burning at the top of them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Who are at the expence of these erections?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Masters of ships <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> themselves. In this country there is a corporation of gentlemen under the name of the Trinity House, of which there are thirty-one governors, called <HI>Elder Brethren.</HI> These gentlemen are authorised by government, to collect from every master of a ship, a certain toll, for the purpose of erecting beacons and land-marks, to point out shelves and sand. Light-houses, are supported also by a similar toll paid to particular people to support the necessary ex∣pences of such lights.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>When a ship is out of sight of land for many weeks, is it possible to know how far they have got upon their voyage?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes. They know this by the Longitude and the Latitude.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Be pleased to explain them to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>The longitude of any place is its distance, east or west from the port we sail. And to find this out, we calculate by the pace or rate that the ship goes at. Knowing how far distant the place is to which the ship is going, seamen take notice, at several periods through the day and night, how fast the vessel sails, as whether she goes six, seven, or eight miles an hour, more or less. This is found by throwing what is called the log line, which is a line with a knot at certain distances, wound off a reel into the water at the ships side, by a minute glass, and in proportion as the ship runs from the knots in this line, each of which is a mile,
<PB N="36" REF="117"/>they, by experience, measure its pace, which is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> down every time the line is thrown, and calculated <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the end of the day. But this is a very uncertain way <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> findidng it out. They are often very much deceived <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> their reckoning. The latitude, which is the distance <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> one place from another, north or south, they can te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> very accurately, as I will hereafter explain, but th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> longitude is what seamen wish to discover, and for thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> purpose most nations have promised large rewards to the discoverer. It may be known by a watch, if on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> could be made to keep time regularly without the lea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> variation; one Harrison invented such a time-keeper, and received from government a reward of twenty thousand pounds; but this does not quite answer the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> purpose, it having been found to vary.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am anxious to know how a time-keeper will discover it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will explain that to you at some future time, when I give you an account of the earth's motion, as you will then better understand it. And I will, at that time, describe the latitude; we will therefore resume our subject. I was telling you, I think, that each ship to be equipped for her voyage, must have a sufficient number of men on board her to work her in her passage.</P>

<P>A very comfortable provision truly! Be kind enough to give me an account of some of the trading companies you mentioned.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>If I explain one, you will understand the whole. I will then give you some idea of the East-India Company.</P>
<P>The East India Company, is a number of people in partnership together for the purpose of trading to the East Indies. Government has granted them a charter for that purpose, on their paying the public four or five hundred thousand pounds a year; so that you see how large their gains are. The Company's stock of money, with which they carry on their trade, consist<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of many millions, and their profits are such, that after paying all expences and losses that occur in this joint trade, they get about twelve per cent for the money they employ. This partnership is open and free to every one that will join them. There are every day persons to be found that will sell a share of this great concern. A five hun∣dred pounds share will entitle a person to a voice or vote in
<PB N="39" REF="120"/>the concerns of the Company, which is principally con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ucted by thirteen directors, chosen annually out of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>artners or proprietors. This Company, since their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>irst establishment, have driven the natives of Bengal-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>to the back part of the country, and are now possessed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f a great extent of territory, and they keep an army or the defence of it. The South Sea Company, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ussian Company, the Hudson's Bay Company, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>frican, are much upon the same plan, though not so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ich, nor trading with so large a stock. The value of each share, or which is the same, of each one hundred <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ounds stock, rises and falls in proportion to the imagi∣nary state of the Company.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>New you mention stock, I could wish to have the nature of government stock explained.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must first tell you, that persons who have money to spare, can, by lending it to those who want <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it, have five pounds annually for the use of every hun∣dred pounds; but no more, as five per cent is the legal interest allowed by law; but, as the security such persons generally give for the return of the principal sum lent, is not considered so good as government security; government, when in credit, can borrow money at less interest than five per cent. When government has established a tax to pay the interest of the money they wish to borrow, they call upon the public to lend them the money, upon the faith and credit of the nation. When this sum of money is advanced, it is called <HI>Stock,</HI> and government every half year pays the interest of this stock to the persons possessed of it. Now suppose I lend government one hundred pounds, and wish some time afterwards to have it again, under an idea that government will never be able to repay me the principal; I cannot get this money back from the state, but I offer my one hundred pounds stock to you. You tell me, the state may be a bankrupt for any thing that is known to the contrary, and then it will not be worth one shil∣ling; however, if I chuse to sell it you will give me sixty pounds for it, which I agree to take.

<P>There are precautions against such unforesseen <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sses. In London there are assurance-offices, that for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> small annual premium, will insure any man's property <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>om loss by fire or the dangers of the sea.

<P>It is too frequently so.

<P>Was every one to do so, he could not lose; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that is impracticable. Credit is the very soul of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>de, which could not subsist without it. There is no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aler's fortune so large, but that he carries on more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>de than he can immediately pay for; of course, he obliged to have credit. Many a man deals largely on credit without any real fortune of his own; besides often happens, that a man would not know what to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y for goods when he buys. The seller may not be able <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>mediately to ascertain their value, and the buyer may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> have had an opportunity to inspect the quality of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ods bought; or they may be purchased at a conside∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ble distance from the buyer; perhaps in the country, at a sea-port.

For the same purpose <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>en in business instead of paying money for goods, will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>quently give promissory notes of hand to pay the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oney in one, two, three or four months, more or less, in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rds to this effect, "Three months after date, I pro∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ise to pay to Mr.—, or his order, the sum of— <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lue received."

<P>This is contrivance to pay money in a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> distant part.

<P>That depends upon opinion and talents. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> as I to choose a trade, it should be where the articles <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>e and fall considerably in price.</P>

<P>Because a clever sensible man, who knows <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> profession, may make his fortune suddenly in such a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>de. For example; I would buy but small quantity of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>h an article when it was dear, because if it fell in its <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce, I should then lose but little; but when it was cap, I would lay out all the money I could, and keep <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ill it was dearer, and by felling it then, I might, per∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, get treble the sum I paid for it, especially if the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rchandise I bought would keep. This is what trades∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> call speculation, buying on foresight.

<P>To make you acquainted with natural history, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> must proceed with a degree of order. Let us first

All that God thought proper to communicate to Moses and the prophets by inspiration, we call <HI>Revelation.</HI> His holy Spirit en∣lightened their minds, and taught them such things as they wished to know, and to teach to others; so that men who would speak of the origin of the world, without an attention to revelation, let them be as wise as they may, can only set forth false systems, which de∣stroy one another, and are little else than dreams of the imagination; whereas, by the recital of Moses, so simple, and at the same time so sublime, the formation of the universe unfolds itself to us in a very satisfactory man∣ner. We will contemplate then, to day, the works of the Lord, the sole author and preserver of nature: And we will first turn our thoughts to the heavens, which declare his power and his glory. What other hand, what other force than his could support, in the infinite expanse above, those great globes which we fee?

<P>Except the sun and moon, we, in general, call all those celestial globes, stars, which we see scattered up and down in the immensity of the heavens; many of them are luminous bodies, that is to say, give light of them∣selves; but there are some that are not luminous, but opake, and give light only, by reflection from the sun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that is to say, the sun shines upon them, and they throw back his light, in the same manner as we see the win∣dows of a house frequently do, towards the evening when the sun is setting.

There it is fixed, except that it rolls continually like a wheel round its axis, with an inconceivable swiftness, but which, on account of its enormous size, it is twenty-five days and a half in do∣ing, and notwithstanding this, as its circumference is 2,398,000 miles, it must turn at the rate of 47,019 miles a day to perform its revolution in that time. To give you an idea of the distance of the sun from us, which, according to allowed calculations, is 80,000,000 of miles off, were we to travel to the sun, and at the rate of 100 miles a day, we should be 2090 years in going.</P>

<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>A Comet is a kind of planet vulgarly called a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lazing star, from its having a fiery tail. It is distin∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uished by a long train or trail of light, in a direction <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pposite to the sun. We are not certain how many there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re; we know only that they describe a prodigious <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ngthened circuit round the sun, which makes them ap∣pear at certain stated times once in a number of years, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eventy or eighty. Comets, when viewed through a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lescope, have a most awful appearance, being large <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>obular bodies with long blazing tails, and something <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ke fiery darts or streams of burning rays about the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>obe itself. Various have been the conjectures of what nature they are, but none to any purpose.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think you said, Sir, that the planets are not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>minous bodies, and of course do not give light from themselves, like the sun.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did. They are dark, opake, and more or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss solid bodies, like the globe of the earth.

Were we in one of the planets, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eth would appear to us, then, as the planets do to us <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>w; that is, like a star.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Permit me, Sir, to say, that this system ap∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ars very singular; you advance that the sun is a fixed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>dy, except its turning round its own axis, and that the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rth and other planets make a periodical revolution <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>und it, from west to east. Now, Sir, if we believe our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n eyes, we are taught the contrary, for the sun seems <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> move, and the earth to stand still. Does not the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> rise every day in the east, and set in the west?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>In appearance it does, but not so in reality, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e earth, as I observed to you, besides its annual revo∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tion round the sun, turns like a wheel round its own <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>s, every twenty-four hours, and by this wonderful <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ntrivance every inhabitant on the earth, is, by rotation, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esented to the sun, and enjoys the benefit of its salutary <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nence. When this motion brings any part of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>th within view of the sun, it is called <HI>day,</HI> but on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t part where the sun does not shine, it is called <HI>night.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>us, in every twenty-four hours is day and night al∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nately occasioned all over the world. This motion of
<PB N="56" REF="137"/>the earth, being from west to east, causes an apparent motion of the sun the contrary way, and other hea∣venly bodies, that is, from east to west; for the fixed stars appear to us, to rise and set as does the sun.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>And how is this accounted for?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because we are not sensible of our own mo∣tion. You must have taken notice, that when we were in a boat, the shore we looked at and every thing upon that shore, seemed to move the contrary way to that we were going; for such is the wise direction of Providence, that partaking of the motion of the earth in common with the earth, we are not sensible of its moving, and of course are led to suppose that the objects move, on which we look. The earth whirls round at the rate of 900 miles an hour, and were we to be sensible of its motion the consequences would be very bad. Indeed, every thing upon it, partakes of the common motion of the globe itself, and is not any way affected by that mo∣tion, in the same manner as no alteration takes place in any thing on board a ship, let the ship move as fast as it will. A bottle of water, for example, hung up, or board a vessel, to empty itself, drop by drop, into ano∣ther bottle placed under it, with a narrow neck, the drops will all fall directly into the bottle, though the ship shall have run many inches whilst the drop was in the air.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>How, Sir, are the seasons accounted for▪</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>As the hours and days are accounted for by the motion of the earth round its axis; so are the months and seasons by its revolution round the sun▪ It makes its great circuit once in twelve months. A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> as the sun is not immediately in the centre of that great circle which the earth describes, it must happen, that in its course, it is at one time of the year nearer th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sun than at another. When it is farthest from the s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> it is our summer; when nearest, winter; and whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> between the two extremes, spring and autumn.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>How is that possible? The nearer th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> earth is to the sun, one would suppose, the more it must feel its heat; now we feel less of its heat in winter than in summer?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>This arises from the position the earth
<PB N="57" REF="138"/><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with respect to the sun. When the sun is farthest <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rom the earth, as in summer, it is over our heads, and its rays fall down perpendicularly upon us, and in that direction, a great many more rays fall on any par∣ricular spot, than when they fall on us in an oblique direction, or come upon us sideways, as they do in win∣ter, the sun being then apparently lower in the hea∣vens. Besides, in summer, then sun though further off, is more hours with us, every day than in winter; of course the longer it shines on us, though perhaps not so hot, the more it warms the earth, than a greater heat would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o in winter in fewer hours.</P>
<P>Therefore, as the earth is round, it is plain to see, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rom its daily and annual motions, that the season, and the days and nights, must vary on the different parts of the globe. It is summer in one part when it is winter <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n another; and the days increase and decrease accor∣ding to the time that the sun is in view. In some parts of the globe, there is only one night and one day throughout the year, that is, the sun is seen for six months in the year, and is not seen for the other six; in these places, the sun never rises very high, but yet sets <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot during the whole six months, but seems to go round and round us; during the other six months it never <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ises. The Greenlanders are in this situation, who ge∣nerally quit the island when the sun leaves it.</P>
<P>Talking of the revolutions of the earth round the sun, leads me to say something to you of the late alteration of our Style. Have you a proper knowledge of it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must confess my ignorance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>The I will explain it to you. Though ge∣nerally speaking, we say, that the earth takes a year to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ake her circuit round the sun, yet the exact time she <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>akes is 365 days 6 hours, wanting some minutes; now, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s our year is divided into 365 days, in four years we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hould lose nearly a day, if we did not add it occa∣sionally to the calendar. To remedy this, every fourth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ear, in the shortest month, February, we add a day, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aking it to consist of twenty-nine days instead of twenty-eight, and this fourth year is called leap-year; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut by this occasional addition of a day, we gain forty-four
<PB N="58" REF="139"/>minutes every year; which in 133 years amount to one day, and in a greater number of years we had gained eleven days; government, therefore, in order to retrench the time so gained, to prevent any change of seasons by such acquisition, and to regulate our year by that of other countries, who had before take the same step, thought it necessary to throw out the eleven days from the ca∣lendar in September 1752, and to call the next day af∣ter the second, the fourteenth. Some years hence it will be necessary to take some such step again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you remember, you promised, when you had explained the earth's motion, to give me an ac∣count of the time-keeper for ascertaining the Longitude.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did; and I cannot do it at a better time than now.</P>
<P>The earth's surface is divided into 360 equal parts, by imaginary lines drawn from north to south, which are called <HI>degrees of longitude.</HI> The earth's daily revo∣lution round its axis eastward, as I told you, is per∣formed in twenty-four hours, consequently, in that time the places under each of those imaginary lines or de∣grees, become in turn opposite to the sun, that is, the sun is, as it were, over the heads of persons dwelling or being in those places, and it is then noon or twelve o'clock at such places. Now from the time any one o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> those lines passes the sun, till the next line passes, it mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> be just four minutes; for twenty-four hours, which i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 1440 minutes, divided by 360, will give four minutes so that for every degree of longitude we sail to the east we, as it were, meet the sun, and noon will be four mi∣nutes sooner than it would have been, had we continues where we were; and, on the contrary, if we sail west∣ward, we, as it were, retire from the sun, and noon will b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> four minutes later. Now, if when it is exactly noon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the place we sail from, which may be known by th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sun, we set the time-keeper at twelve o'clock, and sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> eastward; if this time-keeper does not vary, it will al∣ways tell us the hour it is, at the place we sailed from if upon examination some time afterwards we find it t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> be exactly noon, or twelve o'clock, when the time-keeper points to ten in the morning, it is evident that we a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> two hours eastward of the place we sailed from, whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
<PB N="59" REF="140"/><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s equal to 1800 miles, reckoning sixty miles to a degree; for two hours is thirty times four minutes, and each four minutes being a degree, two hours is exactly thirty degrees, or 1800 miles.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have explained it very clearly. Now, Sir, for the Latitude.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Latitude is the distance of any one place from the Equator, or a supposed line, drawn round the globe of the earth, in the middle between the two poles or ends; that is, the distance from north to south. To have a proper idea of this, you must consider the earth as round or globular, and that there is a fixed star in the north part of the heavens, called the Pole-star. When we are at the Equator, or middle of the earth, this pole-star appears level with the ground we stand on; but as we travel towards it, that is, to the north, this star is observed to rise higher in the heavens; but were we to turn our backs upon it and travel to the southward, that is, from it, we should soon lose sight of it, as the roundness or swell of the earth would hide it from our view. In this case we should see a variety of stars, that, in our present northern hemisphere or situation, we can never see; and the more we continued our journey southwards, the more new stars would arise <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n view; but on our return towards the north, we should lose them again. Now, as when placed in the Equator or the middle of the earth, the pole-star appears on a level with the ground we stand on, so as we travel northward, or towards it, it appears to rise higher in the heavens, and by measuring its height, which is done by an instrument made for that purpose, called a <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uadrant,</HI> we can tell exactly how far we have travelled northward, for every degree the pole-star is risen in the heavens, we have travelled sixty miles from the Equator, so that when we arrive in England, and measure the height of this star, and find it fifty-one degrees and a half; which is the height of the pole-star with us, we know that we are about 3100 miles distant from the middle of the earth.</P>
<P>I will endeavour to explain this better by comparison. Suppose the weathercock on a church-steeple to be seen <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>st above the top of a hill; as we rise the hill, part of
<PB N="60" REF="141"/>the steeple will appear, and the weather-cock will ap∣parently rise higher. In like manner, the higher we get and the more we get over the hill, the higher will the weather-cock appear, as the body of the church will he then seen under it. Let the weather-cock be now the north or pole-star, and the hill, the swell or rotundity of the earth, as the further we advance upon the hill, and travel towards the weather-cock, the higher it seems to be, so the further we travel towards the star, and rise over the rotundity of the earth, the higher will the pole-star appear in the heavens, and of course, the height of the star will measure the length of way we have travelled.</P>

<P>The comparison is a very just one, and an∣swers the purpose you designed by it. You said, Sir, that the Moon was a secondary planet to the earth, and not only revolved round it, but continued so re∣volving, during the earth's whole revolution round the sun?</P>

<P>The Moon is an opake, solid body like the earth, and all the other planets. It is, like them also a globe, about fifty times smaller than the earth, from which it is distant about 240,000 miles.

When in her course round the earth, she happens to be between the earth and the sun, as at new moon, the side on which the sun shine is turned from the earth, and we do not see it, Whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it is in the opposite part of the heavens, and we a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> between the moon and the sun, as at full moon, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sun shines full upon that side that is turned towards u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and we see its full face: when it is in the midway be¦tween both, we see only half the globe of the moo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> enlightened, this is in its first and third quarters, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> it appears horned and what we call gibbous or hump∣backed, according to the quantity of the enlightened pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> we can perceive. Observe, the horns of the moon al∣ways

<P>As to the spots we see so distinctly upon its face or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sk, when viewed through a telescope, they seem to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e the effects of water and hills upon the surface of its <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>obe; hence we presume it is a solid body like the earth, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d may possibly be inhabited, but it appearing to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ve no atmosphere, the people there, if any, do not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eathe.

<P>It is a proof of your judgment, and I am <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ased with it.

Thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> most always happen at full moon.

<P>A Fog is also the vapour rising from the earth, and ow∣ing to the cold morning, particularly in spring and autumn, is condensed, and of course becomes too heavy to rise in the air; it hovers therefore upon the surface of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ground, and sometimes so low, that you may see over it.</P>

<P>From this account of the nature of air, you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> form a good idea of the Wind, which is merely a c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣rent of air, more or less violent, according to the im<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦tuosity with which it moves; for the air fluctuates <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the waves of the sea, and is as capable of being agita<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> to the utmost degree.</P>

It is enough to know the effects of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> four winds. A north wind in winter is very sharp, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in summer, it moderates and refreshes both plants <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> animals.

These are the winds that bring and chace <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ay the rain. It is the property of wind to dry the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d; it is of use to turn wind-mills, where there is not conveniency to erect water-mills; but one of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at benefits, which the wind affords, is, that of assist∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> the vegetation of plants.

<P>There is something wonderful in the phe∣nomena of the monsoons, or trade winds.

In <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Ethiopic, Atlantic, and Pacific oceans (to thirty degrees of the equinoctial line) they are found to blow <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>tinually towards the west; but in the bay of Bengal, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>abian, Chinese, and Indian seas, they blow in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>mer to the north-east, and in the winter to the south∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>t.

</SP>
<SP>

<P>To the powerful influence of the sun in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e warm climates; for when the air is very much <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed, it will rise to the upper part of the atmosphere, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the adjacent air will rush in to supply its place, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> therefore there will be a stream or current of air <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> all parts, towards the place, where the heat is. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it being the property of heat to rarefy or expel the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the same phenomenon will take place in a room, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a fire in it; for as the fire expels the air round it, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> adjacent air will rush in, so that there is a constant <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ght between the window, if open, and the fire, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>reen the doors and the fire, of course to fit in such <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ents or draughts of air, is not only unpleasant, but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>gerous to the health.</P>

<P>I do. With respect to its nature, it is inexplicable riddle. We know only that fire is a p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>¦digious elastic fluid, which gives heat and light. T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> burning fluid, so subtle, and to which we give the n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of electric matter, is spread throughout the atmos∣phere, and exists invisibly more or less in all body. As long as it is shut up, it is peaceable, and as it we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> captive. It requires only a certain degree of motion make us perceive it. Two bodies striking against, rubbed hard, upon each other, is sufficient to let it lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> it then sparkles, gives light, and will communicate wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> it can. Its action lasts till the object it attacks and f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> it, is reduced to ashes. Take notice how the air agit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> and encreases fire. If it wants air, it will smother<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> disappear. The more the air is condensed, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> say, the thicker and heavier it is, the more it presses <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> fire, and increases its heat. This is the reason that is more lively in winter, because the air that surro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> it, is at that time more condensed. For the con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> reason, the air being more ratified, that is to say, lig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> in summer, fire then has less force.

<P>You must allow, however, that it is i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> summer-time and in hot weather, that fire make<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> greatest ravages; for example, the Thunder.

<P>The real opinion of the best natural <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>¦osophers, is, that Lightning is no other than that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>¦tric matter, of which I have told you; a kind of fluid, infinitely subtle and penetrating. This fire communicate and join itself with almost every th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> and become more active and more violent. It rises the earth into the upper regions of the air, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> meeting with a great quantity of imflammable ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣tions, which are a kind of food to electric fire, s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> lightning and thunder. This is so true, that ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>¦mates, where the air is full of bitumen, sulphur, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>¦petre and other like substances, are more subject lightning and thunder than other parts. It thu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> frequently in Italy, and almost all the year in Jam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> but much more seldom in cold countries, and
<PB N="71" REF="152"/><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ere is great deal of rain. Lightning is no more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>an sparks from electrified clouds. Clouds driven by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ontrary winds, collect and beat one against another; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is creates an infinity of sparks, which are the fore-run∣ers of thunder. If the sparks meet with a good deal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f inflammable matter collected, it augments the action <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f the electric fire, so as to break in thunder and thun∣der-bolts. The sudden firing of this matter, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>xpansion and terrible explosion of these globes of fire, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>riking the air with great violence, produces a dreadful <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ife, which is heard a great way off. Though we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow not the nature of this fire, if we judge of it by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s effects, the powers of lightning when accompanied <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ith thunder is great and wonderful. We have known <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e blade of a sword to be melted in the scabbard, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e scabbard not hurt <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a foot burnt in the shoe and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>oe not injured; liquor disappear in a corked bottle, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d the bottle not broke. When thunder is heard <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d no lightning is seen, it is, that the clouds, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>casion the storm, are so thick, so close, and so dark. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not to suffer the lightning to be visible. It was for∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erly an custom in thunder and lightning to ring the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lls in a church steeple, in hopes of destroying the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ect of the lightning by agitating the air with the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>and of the bells; but it has been known to attract <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e lightning and bring it down upon the bells, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>on the ringers, rather than disperse it.

<P>What is there remarkable belonging to the sea? I have heard of the Tides, as a thing very singular.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>This phenomenon is an effect so extraor∣dinary in the nature of Water, that the best natural philosophers, have not yet able to pass more than some rational conjectures on its true cause. It seems as if it pleased God to conceal this among a number of other secrets of nature, which are impenetrable to the human mind. However, the general opinion is, that the sun, and particularly the moon, are mostly con∣cerned in the flux and reflux of the sea. The waters of the sea in the flux, flow or are gently drawn from south to north for the space of six hours; in the reflux, they employ the same time in returning from north to south: resting about a quarter of an hour between the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ebb and flow, and the flow and ebb. When it has lowed its six hours, the water is considerably higher in the place to which it has flowed, and we call it high-water at that place. When it has returned, or ebbed its <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ix hours, we say, it is low-water. But this periodical low and ebb, is not general in all seas, nor equal.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Can you give me no farther account of it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>These tides are of great use when there is little or no wind, in carrying vessels up certain rivers <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n their flow, and conveying them back again in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>me of ebb: they are of similar use about the coasts, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd carry ships at the rate of about five miles an hour. The moon acts upon the water, according to a re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eived opinion, by attraction, that is to say, it raises or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>raws the water towards it, at some certain situations her course round the earth, at which time it occasions swell of the sea, in that part directly under the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oon, and of course as the waters rise in one place, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e waters from other parts will run there.

<P>I told you it was by no means general.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is the moon's power of attraction; always the same in the same parts?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; it has a greater attraction at new and full moon, than at the first or third quarter; for the situation of the moon, with the respect to the sun, at the new and full, is such, that the sun conspires with the moon at those times to attract the waters, and causes a higher tide, than when the moon is in the first or third quarters. At new and full moon, the tides are called <HI>spring-tides,</HI> and rise nine or ten feet above the le∣vel of the water, at low-water mark. When the moon is in the first and third quarter, the water does not rise so high, and the tides are then called <HI>neap-tides.</HI> From the time of neap-tide to that of spring-tide, the water rise every tide more and more; till they get to the highest; from spring-tide to neap-tide, they gradually fall more and more.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Does not the tide alter its time of flowing every day?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>It does; and is in this regulated by the moon; for as the moon rises every day fifty minute later than the day before, so does the sea rise also, that is, it flows 50 minutes later. To give you a better o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> clearer account of it, it would be necessary to explain it by drawings; I have said enough to give you general idea, which is all I aim at.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I understand it very well, and am much obliged to you. I have been told that Sea-water <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not fit to drink. What is this owing to?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because it is salt, and bitter, and of marshy smell. These qualities render it disagreeable to the taste, though it may not be so to a great man who live almost wholly upon the sea. The Czar, Pet<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the Great, obliged his sailors to accustom their children to drink nothing but sea-water, and they all die<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Masters of vessels always provide fresh water for th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ship's company before they fail. The important seen of making salt water fresh, to a certain degree, ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> indeed, been discovered for some years, and most se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> men know how to do it; but they have recourse to the
<PB N="77" REF="158"/>method only upon urgent occasions. Sea-water is heavier than river-water; will of course float greater burdens, and it is on account of its weight, that it evaporates more, and freezes less: it is also more or less salt in certain places. Do not imagine that the salt it contains is useless. Providence has made nothing in vain. The Sun, by its heat, attracts from the sur∣face of the sea a quantity of vapours impregnated with light particles of salt: these vapours rise in the air, and form clouds. They fall again in rain, in snow, in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hail, and sprinkle the land; and, by the salts they con∣tain, assist vegetation. Besides, sea-water affords us salt for our different wants. They make it at the sea∣side; and those places, where they make it, are called salt-pits. They pump in a quantity of water into <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hallow pits, leave it there some time, to be evaporated by the sun, by which means the water is exhaled, and the salt remains: after this, to purify it and make it white, they boil it in vessels till it is dry and fit for use.</P>

<P>The sea affords us still greater benefits; for example, fish in the greatest abundance. Is it known, Sir, how many sorts there are?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>The sea is a liquid world, peopled with an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sinity of inhabitants, different in species, in size, and manner of living. We are acquainted with a great many, but there are probably many we are unacquainted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ith. We find some particular kinds of fish in certain <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>as, and other fish in other seas; as Cod on the banks of Newfoundland. Some come in shoals at particular <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>imes, as Herrings and Mackrell; others, alone; some <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eep about the coasts; others out at sea; some never quit be mud, that is, they crawl at the bottom; others <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>im near the top. The greatest number of fishes are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iparous, that is to say, the young spring from the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>awn or eggs of the female, which are impregnated <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y the male; others are viviparous, that is, produce <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heir young completely formed. Some fish are covered <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ith skins, others with scales, and others with shells. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ue sort is good to eat, another for different uses. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ome they catch after one manner; some after another. Almost all fish are fish of prey, and feed upon others; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>at the voracious, are the least prolific; whilst
<PB N="78" REF="159"/>those which serve others for prey multiply prodigiously; so that no one species can be thoroughly destroyed. The Creator has given to fishes, as to other animals, in∣stinct, and a means of procuring their subsistance. Every species has its mode of attack, its art of defence, and method of stealing away from the pursuit of its enemy.</P>

<P>As far as my reading, and some few con∣versations I have had upon the subject, has enabled me.</P>
<P>The Whale is called the Queen of the Sea, because she is the greatest fish, and the largest of the watery tribe. Whales have been taken from 130 to 200 feet in length, but they are, in general, about 60 or 70 feet long. The head of a Whale is of an enormous size and is about a third of its whole length; but its eye are no larger than the eyes of an Ox. Its whole strength and defence is in its tail, which is very large. It live upon small fish, which abound in the North seas. It <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> chiefly on the coasts of Greenland and about Spitsberge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that they are caught. The Dutch are annually at great expence in this fishery. The fat of the Wha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> yields a quantity of train oil, which is a great artic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of commerce with the Dutch. Many ships go annual from Englands, and to encourage the fishery, whic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with the God fishery at Newfoundland, is a nursery s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> seamen, government gives a bounty for every What that is brought home. It is this fish alone that yield the whalebone. The Whale, and other fishes of t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> like kind, which we call <HI>cetaceous,</HI> are viviparou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> they carry their young nine or ten months, and ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> only one or two young Whales at a time, which th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> suckle a year. Great Whales lay themselves up un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the ice, which they pierce to take air, for they can remain more than half an hour under water with<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> coming to the surface to breathe. They have two tu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> on the head, through which they throw up the w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> to a great height, and with great noise.</P>

<P>I will tell you then. An expert, str<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> sailor throws a harpoon at the Whale, which is an
<PB N="79" REF="160"/>pole, about five or six feet long, with a barbed point, and a rope fastened at the other end. As soon as the Whale feels this stick in its back, it flies; and the cord, which is of great length, is suffered to run out with the Whale. The fish is pursued with boats, and presently <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oses its strength with its blood, and expires on the surface of the water. When dead, they cut it up, as it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ies on the water, and take only on board such parts of t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>as are useful.</P>

This fish is a great enemy to the Whale. There is a Sword-fish, that has a bone in his nose like sword, that attacks and combats the Whale, and puts <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to flight. There is also the Porpoise and the Dol∣phin, which are large fishes.

<P>There are many of an amphibious kind, at is, such as live both by land and by water. For <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ample, the Sea-Cow, the Sea-Wolf, the Sea-Bear, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d the Sea-Lion, who have only two feet, which are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hands or fins to swim with, whereas all other fishes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ve four fins. These frequent great rivers. They <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>e been known to weigh from 1000 to 1200lb weight. They continue more or less time in the water, and Then out of the water, are found feeding, reposing, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ping, upon the ice, upon a rock, or upon the shore.
<PB N="80" REF="161"/>It is at this time they are generally taken. The Tor∣toise is also a kind of amphibious shell-fish, of which there are three species, Land-Tortoises, Sea-Tortoises, or Turtle, and those of fresh water. The Tortoise, or Turtle, is oviparous, and lives a long time; its flesh and eggs are good to eat. Travellers affirm, that they have seen Turtles ten feet long, and seven feet wide. A single one has yielded two hundred weight of flesh. A female Turtle lays more than one hundred and fifty large eggs. They are found in the sand on the shore<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in holes, where they are deposited. A fat Turtle will yield more than thirty pints of oil drawn from its grease. This oil is good in cookery when new, and fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> to burn when old. The fat has even a good flavour will keep and supply the place of butter. In a word, the shell is beautiful; and serves to make a variety of curious things. In some seas, they find Turtles in abundance.</P>
<P>It would be unnecessary to acquaint you with tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> multitude of fishes that is brought from the coasts t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> market, and those various species of shell-fish, such a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Oysters, Muscles, Crabs, Lobsters, &amp;c. which you ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> frequently seen.

Fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> example, we find in the American isles, a fish who<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> skin and scales are red; at Cape Comorin, they hav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> what they call the Golden-fish, which takes its nam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> from a circle round the eye, and a streak from th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> head to the tail, of a golden colour. In the East In¦dies, there are small fishes, black and white, scattere<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with spots of gold and silver.

There is another like an Eel, called the Torpedo, which, then touched, emits sparks of electric sire, and will give <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n electric shock.

<P>We are assured, that its common depth is about 150 fathom, (each fathom six feet) and its greate<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> about 300. We know also, that in certain parts of the sea, there are cavities and caverns, especially in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> centre of mountains, whose tops rise above the surface Mariners do not so much dread these rocks that ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> above water, as those whose tops are below the surface and the many sand-banks and currents by them occa∣sioned, which are very dangerous to navigation.</P>
<P>The different seas are scattered with islands; that i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to say, with land more or less extensives, surrounde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with water; these islands are the tops of great hill and mountains at the bottom of the sea. The greate<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> number of islands are found in the neighbourhood <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> great continents. The Archipelago is a part of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Mediterranean sea, where there is a great quantity <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> islands more or less considerable, and at a little distanc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> from each other.</P>
<P>It is supposed that the greatest part of the island have appeared since the deluge, which occasioned a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> universal overthrow in the surface of the earth. It <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> probable that before the deluge, the waters occupie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> only one side of the globe.

<P>Water-spouts are a great quantity of water drawn up into the air, by the attraction of a low cloud, which seems to descend for that purpose; at a distance it appears like a large funnel, the small end touching the sea, the broad end enveloped in the clouds. Under the small end the water bubbles up, and appears to boil. Was a ship to run foul of one of these spouts, the waters would break, deluge the vessel, and probably sink it. Seamen generally fire a shot at it when within reach, and thus disperse it, which the agitation of the air, by the explosion, seldom fails to do.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>The nature of the mariner's compass.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>This owes its origin to the load-stone; a ferruginous stone found in iron mines, which has the power of attracting iron. The virtue of this stone was known to the ancients. Pliny says, it was discovered by chance, from a shepherd's finding that the nails of his shoes, and the iron ferule of his staff, clung to a load∣stone, over which he walked, but they were ignorant of that singular property it possesses of turning towards the poles. We do not know to whom to attribute this important discovery. The invention of the compass is given to a Dutchman, in the year 1229. It is an iron needle or hand, like the hand of a clock, fixed on a point, so as to run round; and one end being touched by the loadstone, which communicates its virtues to it, makes it always turn to the north. Thus a mariner, knowing what way he is to go, is always directed, though he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>es no land. And what revolutions in things has the loadstone produced! It has made us acquainted with the new world: before this invention, seamen never ventured out of sight of land; but now they have tra∣versed the whole globe. It is to this we are indebted to,
<PB N="84" REF="165"/>not only for the discovery of new countries, but for the rich mines of gold and silver, which these coun∣tries produce, and which would have been lost to us, if we had never reached those shores.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you please; and we will penetrate its very bowels. We have hitherto considered the earth as a planetary globe, performing its stated revolutions, according to the order which the Creator has established in his arrangement of the world: let us look now into it's composition, and into it's internal and external pro∣ductions.</P>
<P>The earth is divided by the sea into four great quar∣ters, Europe, Asia, Africa, and America. These dif∣ferent parts of the world are very different in size, form, climate, and productions. The Author of nature has been pleased to throw into his work a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> infinite variety. Here, are immense plains, there, in∣accessible rocks, and farther off, are mountains that to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the clouds. The inequalities on the surface of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> earth, we attribute to the great overthrow of nature at the general deluge, to the currents of the sea and the rivers, and to subterraneous irruptions. Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> learned presume to say, that since the creation, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> globe has been alternately sea and land; that is t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> say, that such parts as are now land, were once covert with the sea; and such parts as the sea now overflow were once dry land: but this is difficult to demonstrate.</P>

<P>No. The earth varies infinitely in its soil, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at is, in its qualities. We divide the nature of lands to six different classes.

Hence arises the astonishing diversity of earthly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>oductions. Some fruits will grow on certain lands, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d in climates adapted to their kind, which would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow no where else.

Ostrich feathers are large and beautiful. We dye them of various colours, and use them for ornament: its down or hair serves to make hats or bonnets. This bird, like many others, will swallow iron, flint, and other hard substances, in order to assist digestion, but they do not digest it, as people have supposed. They say also, erroneously, that the imprudent Ostrich deposits its eggs in the sand, and leaves them to the care of the sun; when it is certain that they sit on them in the night, though they leave them in the day, knowing that burning heat of the climate is sufficient to hatch them.</P>

<P>You would not say so of the Nightingale?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh no. If its cloathing be not so gaudy, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts voice is enchanting. There is no inhabitant of the groves that can vie with it in melody.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>They say, that besides its melodious notes, he Nightingale has an excellent memory; that it will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>etain a whole song, and repeat it with the same modu∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tion of voice with which it was sung. Having made <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ou acquainted with the largest birds, I will now give <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ou some account of the smallest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is it, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Humming bird. This bird, so com∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on in America, especially the male, is a master-piece <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f nature. It is wonderful, not only in the variety and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>reliness of its colours, but also in the littleness of its
<PB N="100" REF="181"/>body. It is not bigger than a small nut. There is in Canada a species still smaller, called the Bird-fly; which is not larger than a great fly. Its flight, how∣ever, is extremely rapid. Could you suppose it? This small bird will attack a crow, and beat it down from the middle of the air. It is so beautiful a bird, that the Indians make ear-rings of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>And the Parrot, does it not merit our attention?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly. It is, perhaps, the most won∣derful bird in the world. Not only for the beauty of its feathers, but its faculty of imitating the human voice. This is a native of America. They reckon more than fifty species of Parrots, different in figure, in size, and in colour. They fly in flocks, and live in the forests. In a cage they will eat any thing, and may be fed with any thing except flesh, which is not good for them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I should admire the Parrot beyond any bird, if it was not so dirty, so humoursome and so clamo∣rous. Your are doubtless acquainted with other particu∣arities among birds?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Shall we enter upon those of Passage, who go and come according to the seasons? Quails, for example, pass from Africa to Europe in the Spring, and return towards the end of Autumn; you may see them traverse the Mediteranean sea in flocks. They are fre∣quently taken on board ship, where they alight to re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> themselves. As they love a moderate climate, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Africa is too hot in Summer, they pass that season i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Europe; and as the cold is too sharp here in Winter they then go to Africa. There are also other birds o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> passage, Wild Geese and Ducks, Cranes, Woodcock Snipes, and many more, whose instinct leads them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> select those countries that agree best with them. So<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> fly in confused flocks; others preserve order, and t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> in rows, in order to cut the air the better. That whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> flies first is relieved from time to time by others.</P>
<P>It is imagined that Swallows, who appear in t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Spring, pass a great part of the Winter in Europ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> although such as leave us about the end of Autumn: frequently caught, in great quantities, on the decks<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="101" REF="182"/>ships, tired with flying. The truth is, those of the Northern countries of Europe do not go away in Winter. They are found in Sweden collected in heaps, hanging upon one another in a torpid state, in hollow places: they quicken and appear again with the first warm weather.</P>
<P>It is very singular that all these birds foresee the time to depart, collect themselves together, fly night and day, and go to the place designed without wandering. Where is the traveller who, in so long a journey, would not be obliged to enquire his way?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>They are certainly directed by Providence; for who, but him, can give so much fore-sight to animals?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Say not only fore-sight, but address and sagacity. You have taken notice of the structure of a bird's nest. These architects have no other tools than their beaks and their feet. You see, however, how curiously they build their houses, and how carefully they line them, that their callow young may lie so't. What mason could build a swallow's nest, which is con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tructed of mud, and hangs under the eves of houses? The nests of the Tit-mouse and Wren are master-pieces of industry. The most able artist could not make one like them. How wonderful is the care and exactness of all birds in sitting upon their eggs, and sufficient <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ngth of time to hatch their young: how attentive are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ey afterwards to feed them and bring them up! See <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ith what resolution a Hen will defend her Chickens from a Dog! Was it a Bull-dog, she would put it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> flight.</P>
<P>Shall I relate to you now the birds that live equally <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> land and by water? Such have their feet webbed, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>at is, provided with a membrane spread between their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>es, for the purpose of swimming. They are covered <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>th down and feathers, so compact as to keep out the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ter. Some have long beaks, adapted to raking in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t mud, where they find their food; others are fishers <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d live upon fishes, such as the Cormorant, the King∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>er, and others; others, again, live upon herbs and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>suction, as the Water-hen and Sea-duck. There are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d that are enemies to the day, and fly only in the
<PB N="102" REF="183"/>night, as Owls and Bats. Of all birds, the Bat is the only one that does not lay eggs. This is rather a flying Mouse, being covered with hair, and having the head and body of a mouse. You have seen them I dare say. It flies about at dusk, and is called a Flitter-mouse. It suckles its young and brings forth two at a time. There are several species of this animal, which seems to have nothing of the bird but the power of flying.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>By the detail you have given me, I am now acquainted with most of the feathered tribe. Will you next give me some account of Insects and Reptiles?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing is more wonderful than the manner in which the Creator has peopled the universe, with animals of all kinds: and we may say, that Insects, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> vile as they may appear, are one of the principal pro¦ductions of nature. The greatness and wisdom of God is not more conspicuous than in these little animals.</P>
<P>There is an infinity of Insects. The air, the earth, the waters, swarm with them. Some are pleasing t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> look at, others hideous, some are useful, others hurtful. There are infinitely more invisible than such as we see. Some fly, and others crawl. There is one insect the most remarkable of any, and at the same time the most use∣ful of any.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is, I suppose, the silk-worm?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are right. You know that it is from this, we draw, that most delicated thread, that compose our finest silks. The silk-worm was brought into Eu∣rope from the East Indies, about the year 550, its la¦bour is very curious. At first this insect is only th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> egg of a butterfly or moth; in the spring the he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> hatches it, and it becomes a small worm, a caterpilla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> which grows very fast and is nourished by the leaves <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Mulberry-tree. When this worm has changed i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> skin three times, its growth is finished; it then spi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> about itself a cod or pod of silk, in the middle of which it forms a retreat in something like a tender shell, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> enclosure in which it shuts itself up; thence it become a Chrysalis, that is, envelloped in a case, and after¦wards a moth or butterfly; when come to this state, pierces it cod and comes out: some days after, it la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> its eggs and dies. A single moth will lay more th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="103" REF="184"/>500 eggs, which are preserved till the next year. This metamorphosis or change, is common so many kinds of insects, as Caterpillars, Bees, and Wasps, which from worms hatched from eggs, become chrysales, and then Flies, or Flying Insects.</P>
<P>You have no doubt, taken notice of the Ant. It gives us an example of industry. Ants will assemble many together to draw a little piece of wood, or a grain of corn to the bottom of their subterraneous granaries. It has been supposed that they hoard it up in magazines, to feed themselves in winter; but we have known that they remain benumbed, and without eating all this sea∣son, heaped up upon one another in an ant-hill. In certain countries, there are larger Ants, that very much incommode the inhabitants.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>And the Bees, Sir, is not their industry and labour very remarkable?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very; a hive of Bees has been compared to a republick, where each subject labours for the com∣mon good, and where all things are kept in good order. There is in all hives the mother Bee, which is called the queen, she is larger, longer, and brighter coloured than the rest. This mother lays all the eggs, from which the whole hive of Bees are hatched. She is so fruitful, that in the course of a year, she will sometimes give life to more than 40,000 Bees. The Bees have such an at∣tachment to their queen or common parent, that was she to die, they would disperse or suffer themselves to perish. Wherever she goes, they will follow her. Some men have searched for this queen Bee and having found it, placed it on their arm, and the whole swarm have there followed it. They will not sting, unless rudely treated or roughly handled. When the hive it too full of Bees, the young ones will swarm out and establish themselves in some other place. Bees are very useful on account of the honey and the wax that they yield, and which they collect from flowers and deposit in the money combs within the hive.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>You do not appear to me, Sir, to have de∣scribed, that quantity of flies and gnats, which we every where see. I admire very much the surprizing variety of figures and colours in Butterflies.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="104" REF="185"/>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Would you suppose that in France, they carry collections of Butterflies to a foolish excess? There have been people who have ruined themselves in collecting of flies. The finest Butterflies that we have seen in the cabinets of the curious, are from the Indies.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have been often struck in the evenings, with the brightness of Glow-worms.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is only in great heat of weather, that Glow-worms throw out this light; but there are still more luminous insects in America. Travellers have related, that sometimes the Americans have made use of no other light in their huts; and that to this day, when they walk out at night, they take one of these insects in their hands, and fasten one to each foot. These are by some called the Lantern-fly. They give as much light as a lamp; so as to enable us to read and write by them. There are other things that will give light in the dark, Lobster-shells, Touch-wood, and other things. And there are substances that will take fire of themselves when exposed to the air, without any fire being com∣municated to them; phosphorus, for example, "which i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a chemical mixture producing a powder; but to retur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to our subject, since we are on the subject of reptiles I will make you acquainted with one that has drawn th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> attention of naturalists more than all the rest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray what is that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Polypus. It is a little worm of the figure of a hollow tube. There are several species of them. This worm is sometimes taken for an aquati<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> plant; it lengthens and contracts itself at pleasure. I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> breeds prodigiously, and what is most astonishing, con∣trary to the common order of animals, it produces, with¦out the assistance of a male. Cut a Polypus in five parts and each part will become a complete animal, which will produce others, before even the first shall be quit separated from the trunk of the old Polypus. What have advanced concerning this worm, is the opinion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the ancients, though some moderns have supposed it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> fable, and to imply a republic of little animals labourin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to form a colony, like the metropolis from whence the sprung.</P>
<P>We may take notice here of another phenomenon
<PB N="105" REF="186"/>the reproduction of Snails. Naturalists assure us, that if we cut off the head of one, it will not die, but get a new one. A learned observer of modern times pub∣lished a tract containing the sentiments of many cele∣brated natural historians. It has been said that the four horns which the Snail shoots out and draws in at plea∣sure, are a kind of telescopes through which it sees; but this observer maintains, the Snail hath no eyes, but that these horns are a kind of very sensible antennae which nature has given the reptile, and which it puts forth to feel whether any thing approaches it. If this be the case, it is perhaps of all animals the only one that is deprived of sight, which even the Mole is not without.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is very singular, but how is it that men apply themselves to the study of objects so little important? For my part I do not see the use of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>I agree with you that, in the study of na∣ture, there are many things which are objects of mere curiosity, but the human mind is insatiable for know∣ledge; besides, when in the examination of smaller ob∣jects, we seek only to contemplate the infinite wisdom of the Creator: this consideration is not unuseful to man, nor unworthy of him; since nothing that exists is judged unworthy of the great Author of nature. But let us not lose our time in reflections.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Are there any other reptiles?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and very dangerous ones, especially Serpents. Different countries have different species of Serpents: there are some which we have no reason to dread, they are so familiar. Some are winged, others amphibious. There are some more than twenty feet long, which attack and destroy the largest Quadrupeds; there are water Serpents, and Serpents of the sea, of a prodigious size, and very formidable to seamen. Among other Serpents we reckon the Rattle-snake as one, so dangerous, and yet so common in America. In Nu∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nidia many persons have been destroyed by the bite of Serpents. The Viper, a kind of Adder, is viviparous, whereas all other Adders are oviparous. The Asp is another species of serpent which the ancients considered is one of the most venemous. They say it throws the person they bite into a lethargic state, and thus destroys
<PB N="106" REF="187"/>him. History says, it was thus Cleopatra, Queen of Egypt, put an end to her existence, that she might not fall under the power of Augustus. We hardly know now to what species of Serpents to give the name of Asp; but that which we call the Asp in Europe, and which resembles the Viper, is not venemous. Besides we never fail of remedies abainst the venom of Ser∣pents. It is remarkable, that in countries where there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the greatest quantity of venemous animals, there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> found the greatest collection of simples and counter-poisons. Many of these reptiles are very useful in medicine. We employ the Viper for the cure of many disorders. The oil and powder of the Scorpion, whose bite is mortal, are excellent remedies. We cure the wound made by many animals, by bruising them upon the wound. Viper oil is a cure for the bite of a Viper. In short, there is none, even to the toad, that is not of use in medicine. Snakes have been thought venemous, but there are persons who hunt them and eat them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Among insects, is not the Spider, for exam∣ple, poisonous?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>In certain countries, the Spider, is very large and venemous. What is related of the bite of the Tarantula is singular. It is a kind of Spider very com∣mon in Calabria. They pretend to say, that it will make some sing, others laugh, and others cry; and that the cure is brought about by the sound of some musical instrument; which sets the patient a dancing, till he faints with exercise, but all this is mere trick. These Spiders are no more dangerous than ours, which have been eaten with safety.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>What a wonderful spinner the Spider is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. How is this accounted for?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Spider is furnished with six nipples from whence flows that matter of which its web is drawn. The female Spider forms a cod of silk about its eggs. In the year 1709, a person at Montpelier collecte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> enough of this silk to make a pair of stockings and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> pair of mittens, which he sent to the academy of science at Paris.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>This discovery would not probably have
<PB N="107" REF="188"/>been very useful in commerce. Have you finished your observations on reptiles and insects?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall soon have done. All I would further observe is, that in insects and reptiles, the male is com∣monly smaller then the female, whereas in quadrupeds, it is the largest of the two. I would add, that by the assistance of a microscope, which is an instrument that magnifies exceedingly, it has been found, that there is an infinity of living animals swimming in all liquors, floating in the air, and swarming in the earth, much smaller than a hand-worm, which the eye can scarcely discern. Would you believe, that in a drop of the in∣fusion of an herb, of vinegar, or of blood, we discover by a glass, a multitude of animalcula or small animals of different kinds, which move with great agility. Millions of insects are spread thoughout the air, where they are invisible, and the eggs which they deposit in liquors, are hatched there by fermentation. In short, when we come to consider that every one of these living atoms has eyes, and the different parts of an organized body, that there are in these several parts, muscles, nerves, veins, blood, and all things of which an animal body consists, and almost imperceptible; what are we to think of the supreme artist that formed them!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>We cannot sufficiently adore his infinite powers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>But we shall have now a new motive of adoration and gratitude, in his magnificence and bounty. It remains that we examine into quadrupeds, that is, four-footed animals. He has created the greatest num∣ber to supply the wants and convenience of men. They are also exceedingly varied in figure, in nature, and in instinct.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let us begin our review with those animals that are useful.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is natural so to do. Among these you must be sensible we owe the first rank to horned beasts, and those which furnish us with wool. How great is this benefit to man! If a hen is a little treasure to him, by laying, as some will, 300 eggs in a year, a cow is a great one, she supplies us with milk, with butter, and with cheese, and gives us each year a calf. What a
<PB N="108" REF="189"/>consumption is there at our tables of beef and veal! What is more healthy or more nourishing! If we are in want of horses to cultivate the land, or draw heavy burthens, the ox comes to our assistance. It is em∣ployed in draught in many countries. Though slower, it is capable of more fatigue than a horse, and is fed at less expence. After he has worked some years, he is fatted and killed, and his flesh is brought to market. Neither do his services end with his life, his skin tanned is va∣luable; this gives leather. In short, the gall, the blood, the fat, the bones, the horns, the guts, the hair, and even the dung of this animal, is converted to some useful purpose.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>You cannot say so much of the sheep?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>A agree with you as to services of strength; but in every other respect, this animal so timid and which seems so pitiful in itself, is very valuable to man, since it supplies us, at the same time, with food and raiment, not to mention the other advantages we draw from its tallow, its skin, its guts, and its bones. The flesh of mutton is light, succulent, and of easy digestion. The milk of the sheep is sweet and wholesome; be∣fides, we know that the wool is one of the greatest ob∣jects of commerce, and how much its use is extended. It is different in quality, and Sheep themselves vary very much in different climates; we call the male of the Sheep, a Ram. Many Sheep have horns upon their heads; some are covered with hair instead of wool. In Spain the wool is much finer than with us, and our best cloths are made of Spanish wool. The Tails of the Sheep at the Cape of Good Hope, weigh fifteen or twenty pounds, and are broad enough to turn back and cover their whole backs. In Tartary such tails have weighed near eighty pounds.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>You will have much to say, to doubt, of the Horse.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are so well acquainted with this animal that it is needless to describe him. I will observe to you only that he is endowed with a wonderful instinct. The relate very singular acts of his good-nature and h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> character. We have heard of an old horse feeding be¦tween two young ones, and that the young ones chewe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="109" REF="190"/>his hay and oats of him, and presented it to him in his manger. The Horse is reckoned old at twelve years of age, though he sometimes lives twenty or thirty. After seven or eight years old, he diminishes in value in proportion as his age advances.</P>

<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Ass, I presume, deserves but little at∣tention?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Ass does not deserve the contempt it meets with. His long ears perhaps is one cause. This animal in however very useful, it lives upon little, and can bear a great deal of fatigue; and the milk of the female is reckoned very salutary to consumptive habits. In some countr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es the Ass is swift-footed. In some parts of France they run post with Asses, as they do in Spain with Mules. Arabian Asses are excellent for rid∣ing; they get on so fast, that no Horses can keep up with them.</P>
<P>Mules are a distinct species, they are engendered be∣tween an Ass and a Mare. As Mules are of two natures <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nited, they are very rare, for they never breed them∣selves. They are reckoned very sure-footed, and in Spain, they breed them with care, and sell them at a great price.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have named I think, the principal ani∣mals: but there are more quadrupeds; the one do∣mestic, as the Dog, the Cat, and so on; others wild, as the Hare, the Rabbet, the Goat; and there are others again that are dangerous and hurtful, as the Wolf, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ox, the Wild Boar—I hope you will speak of all in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urns.</P>

<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Was I to do this, I might go on till to∣morrow. I cannot however pass over all of the in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lence. You mention the Dog, for example.

<P>I have seen a Dog, too, turn a spit, by put∣ting him in a wheel, that runs round; but they render us greater services. They hunt, guard the house and the flocks of their master. What fidelity they possess! They are the very emblem of this virtue. Many Dogs have broke their hearts and died for the loss of their master. I had a Spaniel that suffered himself to die with jealousy, because I placed my affections upon ano∣ther little dog. Many have defended the life of their master at the expence of their own; others have dis∣covered the assassin. In short, there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> thousand re∣markable things of the fidelity. the address, and other qualities of the Dog.

<P>I do. Perhaps he might be better name<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the tyrant of the woods. We call him the King, be¦cause be has apparently more courage, and more strength than all animals besides. His air is noble and fierce. When he is angry, his eyes sparkle. His roar alone will frighten the inhabitants of the forests. Every beast flie him: he is a great hunter, and preys upon every anima<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> he seizes. The Lion, however, is the emblem of gene¦rosity, as he is the symbol of courage. There are man stories to prove him full of gratitude. The followin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in one among the rest. A Knight of Malta being o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a hunting, heard some dreadful cries. He advance and saw a Lion entwined with a great Serpent; touche<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with compassion he killed the Reptile, without wounding the Lion. From that moment the Lion became attache<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to his deliverer and would not quit him. The Knigh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> being about to embark on board a ship, they told hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> they had not sufficient provisions on board the vessel <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> take charge of the Lion. They determined therefo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to leave him on the shore. The animal seeing the vest

<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>What a wonderful act in a beast! It must be allowed, Sir, that animals frequently set us examples of a good disposition, which we do not follow so closely as they do. You said the Lion was the strongest animal. Is not the Elephant stronger?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, but then it is much larger. It is the tallest and biggest of all animals. It is a living colossus. They have been seen more then fifteen feet high. There are many Elephants in Asia and Africa, but those of the East Indies are the largest. The figure of an Elephant is unlike that of every other quadruped. It is a heavy mass, without proportion. It has two great teeth on each side of its mouth, which are its weapons of de∣fence. Besides this, it has a long nose like a tube, with which it takes up its food, and which it uses as a hand. The Elephant eats a great deal, though it can stay seven or eight days without eating or drinking. Although very heavy, it is swift of foot, and can gallop, but it does not turn readily. This animal, though wild, is very docile, being easily tamed. There is nothing to fear from it, but when it is irritated. We derive great services from the prodigious strength of the Elephat. It will carry more than 3000 pounds. Formerly they were used in war. Towers full of bowmen and archers were placed upon their backs, and they pushed on among the thickest <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>atallions: men, horses, machines, all give way to their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>normous weight. The greatest enemy of the Elephant, is the Tiger, the Lion, the Rhinoceros, Serpents, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>specially Man, by the various means he makes use of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o kill him or to tame him. There are various ways of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>king them. Hunting the Elephant is one of the great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>easures of Asiatic princes. The Africans, who take <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>im only for what he produces, dig in their way holes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hich they cover over lightly, and in which they fre∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uently fall. Others dare to attack them openly. Some <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onderful things are related of the instinct and cha∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>cter of this animal, of his docility, his understanding, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is address, his affection and gratitude for his conduc∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>; we allow him even the sense of shame. All these
<PB N="112" REF="193"/>qualities are the cause of the great veneration the Ele∣phant is held in by many people. At Siam, 100 officers are employed in the service of a white Elephant. He is lodged in a magnificent pavilion, walks under a ca∣nopy, and is served in vessels of gold. Eastern nations are foolish enough to believe that the soul of their em∣perors pass after their death into the body of an Ele∣phant. I shall close this long account with telling you that it is a long-lived animal, and that its great teeth yield the ivory, of which so much use is made.</P>
<P>The Rhinoceros, is the most curious, and after the Elephant, one of the largest quadrupeds. It is more than six feet high and twelve long, and is said to grow fifteen years, and live a hundred. It carries upon it<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> nose a long, strong horn, which is sometimes double, and with this it attacks and throwns down the Elephant. Its horn is much sought after, as many qualities are at¦tributed to it, as well as the blood and its very strong skin. It feeds much as does the Elephant, and is found in the same countries.</P>

<P>I am not acquainted with all; however <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> can name you another. That is the Camel, a very useful quadruped. His common height is about seven feet and a half from the crown of his head, which he carrie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> very high. He has a very small head upon a very long neck, and his body is about the bigness of an Ox. There are several kinds of Camels, those of Arabia have a bunch upon their backs. They are sometimes called Dromedaries. Those of Persia has two bunches. It<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> hair is short and soft, and in the spring it falls off i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> three days. Of the hair are made pencil brushes fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> painting, and some of the finest hats. This animal i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of little use but for burthen, and it will carry near 1200 pounds. In order to be laden it kneels down. It wil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> travel from twenty-five to thirty leagues a day, and wil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> go near nine days without drinking. The Camel eat but little, and feeds upon herbs, hay, and the leaves o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> trees. It lives commonly fity years. They never bea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it to make it go on; the driver need only to whistle o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sing. I will next mention a few strange animals; o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

<P>The most formidable of these animals is the Crocodile, which is found on the borders of the Nile and other great rivers. There are some monstrous ones <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n the marshes adjoining the Ganges in the East In∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ies. One was taken in the island of Madagascar, more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>han fifty feet long, and much larger have been seen. History relates that there was one on the borders of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iver Megrada in Africa, a Crocodile so monstrous, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> defended itself a long time against the efforts of a whole army. At that period, cannon were unknown, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd they could only destroy it by knocking it down with great stones which they threw at the spine of its <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ack. Regulus sent its skin to Rome, and it was more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>han eighty feet long. The Crocodile has short feet, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd its body is covered with scales as hard as to resist <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on.</P>

<P>No; Providence has wisely prevented this. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> has taken care to give being to two other animals <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>qually amphibious, who are mortal enemies to the Crocodile. One is the Hippopotamus or Sea-Horse. This animal is as large as an Ox, with a head some∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hing resembling a Horse; its skin is an inch thick, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> hard, that a musquet ball will scarce penetrate it. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is one of the most furious of amphibious creatures, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd has terrible teeth, with which it attacks the Croco∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>le. The other is the Ichneumon, or the Egyptian <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at, which is something less then a Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. This little <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nimal is so mischievous, that it attacks Serpents, Dogs, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd even Camels. It devours young Crocodiles, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>estroys their eggs which it finds in the sand. It is on
<PB N="114" REF="195"/>account of the essential service it renders, in preventing too great an increase of Crocodiles, that the ancient people of Egypt have ranked the Ichneumon in the num∣ber of their Gods. But, I must dwell no longer on animals. We will finish with the Beaver.</P>

<P>Yes; and is one of the most remarkable and at the same time one of the most sagacious animal in providing for its safety and convenience. The Beaver<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is truly an architect. They are more industrious than either the Bee or the Ant. They build houses upon land, opposite to the current of great rivers, with stake and cement, and that with an art and cleverness that i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> astonishing. And yet they have no other instruments fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> this purpose, then their teeth, their feet, and their tail<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Their tail which is flat and large serves them for a trowel Their teeth is their saw, and with their feet, they brea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> and soften the clay.

<P>What a prodigious number of animals the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> are of all kinds! It is, however, to be lamented, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> there are so many dangerous ones.

<P>It is presumed that at the Creation, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> were endowed with a better disposition.

<P>You must permit me, Sir, to make one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>¦flection more.

<PB N="115" REF="196"/>their species; but I do not know how it is that corruption engenders worms.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Corruption does not engender them. It is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n old error, which has deceived you. Nothing can spring from putrefaction; if it did, we should see every¦day new animals, which is not the case. The Creator <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n forming the world, established a general and immu∣table law in all things, and by this law, every animal engenders, or begets its like, and will do so to the end of time. Thus all animals proceed from their father and mother. This is sufficiently to be seen in the larger <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nimals. If we observe occasionally swarms of insects <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ise from the midst of putrefaction, it is, as I have told <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ou, that female insects of the same species have there deposited their eggs, and that heat warming them, fer∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>entation has hatched them. Natural instinct teaches <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nsects to choose out those substances readiest to corrupt, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd of course best adapted to supply their young with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ood as soon as hatched.

<P>Because they experienced the inconveni∣ences, and became sensible of the absurdities of this religion.

<P>There is no variety of religion in Roman Catholic countries. Why is there here?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because those States will not suffer it; but it is one of the blessing of our constitution to be in∣dulged in a liberty of conscience.

But we are wandering from the subject we were upon, that of the duty and privileges of the King of England. His duty I told you. His privi∣leges are as follow.</P>
<P>The King is the chief and sole magistrate of the na∣tion, can of his own authority, reject any act of Par∣liament presented to him for signing, and in such cases, it never passes into a law; he can make any treaty with foreign powers, create any Peers, and pardon any of∣fence, except where the constitution interferes. The King can also make war and peace, without the consent of his Parliament; but though he can declare war, he cannot carry it on without money, and this money he cannot get without the people's consent; this therefore obliges him never to make war but with the approbation of Parliament. He has the appointment of Ambas∣sadors to foreign Courts, who represent the King that sends them, and protect their countrymen when oc∣casion requires it.</P>
<P>The King is considered as the head of the Church Army, and the Navy, and as such has the appointmen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of all the Bishops, and Officers. He is also considered as the fountain of honour, and of course confers all titles.</P>

<P>The first great tax is a Land Tax, by which gentlemen who have estates pay four shillings in the pound, or 100 pounds out of every 500 pounds, this with the tax upon Malt, raises about 3,000,000 pounds.</P>
<P>There is next a tax on the exportation and importa∣tion of Merchandize. This is conducted by the Com∣missioners of the Customs.</P>
<P>Then there is an Excise duty, that is, a tax on Beer, Cyder, Perry, Spirits, Silks, Linens, Starch, Hair-Powder, Carriages, things sold by Auction, travelling in Post Chaises, Men Servants, Coffee, Tea, Chocolate, Wines, Paper, Vinegar, Glass, Hops, Candles, Soap, Leather, Malt, and a variety of other articles. These are under the controul of the Commissioners of Ex∣cise.</P>
<P>Another tax is four shillings and two-pence on every bushel of Salt.</P>
<P>Another are the Stamp duties, under the Commis∣sioners of the Stamp Office. This is a tax on Writ∣ings relative to Law-Suits, and agreements of every kind, upon Almanacks, News-Papers, Advertisements, Pam∣phlets, Cards and Dice, Receipts, and Bills of Exchange.</P>
<P>There are others upon Houses and Windows, Hackney Coaches, and Chairs, within the Bills of Mortality, Le∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>acies, and one shilling in the pound out of all salaries <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd perquisites of Offices and Pensions paid by the Crown.</P>

<P>The Sheriff of the county then is the first. His office is that of Chief Gaoler and he has the custody of all criminals and delinquents in the district within his command. Though I call him Chief Goaler, he is, by virtue of his office for the time being, the first man in the county, and ranks before every nobleman therein. There is one presiding over every county, and is ap∣pointed by the King, out of the gentlemen resident in that county. The county prison, and the keeper of that prison are under his controul, and it is his duty to execute the sentence of the law upon all criminals, himself, or to find one to do it for him, though that sen∣tence extend even to death. Most gentlemen aspire to the office of Sheriff, though it is attended with the ex∣pence of 5 or 600 pounds for the year they serve. There are two Sheriffs for the City of London, chosen by the City.</P>
<P>The next officer to the Sheriff is the Coroner. Every county has more than one. Some have four, some six, according to the extend of the county. He is chosen by the freeholders, and his office is for life, though he may be removed for misconduct. His duty is to en∣quire into the death of such as are killed, die suddenly, or in prison; he has fees upon the occasion, so that his place is a place of emolument.</P>

<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is the Lord Lieutenant?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>He is generally some man of rank in the county, and is appointed by the King during the plea∣sure of the Crown.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is his office?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>He acts under the King in a military ca∣pacity. Besides appointing the Magistrates for the county, he appoints all the Officers in the county Militia, and is himself the Colonel, and in case of any invasion by a foreign enemy, would take the military command of the county. This is held to be a very honourable employ, and is much coveted by men of the first rank.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have frequently mentioned <HI>rank,</HI> is it of any use to a man?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Of great use. Precedence in rank is more attended to by great people then you are aware of. Precedence generally takes place in the following order. Princes, Archbishops, Dukes, Marquisses, Earls, Vis∣counts, Bishops, Barons, Knights of the Garter, Privy Counsellors, Judges, Baronets, Knights of the Bath, Knights, Doctors, Esquires, and Gentlemen. The no∣bility are very particular to preserve their rank on all public occasions: and you will find a title respected every where. Besides, if there are any offices of profit in government, the church, the army, or the navy, the nobility can procure them for themselves or their rela∣tions in preference to other people; and all the depart∣ments about the King are commonly filled with them. And add to this, they have a number of privileges. A Peer, like a Member in the House of Commons, cannot be arrested and thrown into prison for debt; they have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll their post letters free of expence, and can frank or free the letters of others. A peer, if guilty of a cri∣minal act, is tried always by the House of Lords, and can command an audience of the King at any time, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, can see him and speak to him, without fearing to be
<PB N="128" REF="207"/>refused admittance: and they, as well as Clergymen, re∣ceiving the benefit of clergy, are not burnt in the hand.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not comprehend what you mean by Benefit of Clergy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is called <HI>Benefit of Clergy,</HI> had its rise in the pious reverence of christian princes for the church in its infant state, being an institution to exempt the Clergy from being criminally proceeded against by secular or lay judges. Popish exclesiastics soon made an ill use of this, for they afterwards claimed this indul∣gence, not only for themselves, but for all attendants upon the church, whether they were Clergymen or not; and in length of time, this exemption grew gene∣ral, and all who could read had the same indulgence, reading being a great mark of learning in those days of ignorance, till an act of Parliament of Henry VII. made a distinction between Lay-men and Clergymen, subjecting the former for certain crimes deserving death, to be burnt with a hot iron on the left thumb, and deny∣ing them this privilege a second time, and they are now not even required to read, but the indulgence is gene∣rally granted to all persons both men and women. Clergymen, however, if found guilty of such offences as claim this benefit of clergy are not burnt in the hand, but immediately discharged, and this as often as they offend; whereas others suffer death for the second of∣fence: and as to Peers when found guilty, they are dis∣charged without burning in the hand, but if condemned for the same offence of second time, will, like other lay∣men suffer death.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>How do persons procure title?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>By interest, that is to say, by their influ∣ence with the King or the Ministers of State; and some∣times by services which they have done the State.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Of what kind is this influence?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Many Gentlemen from their extensive pro∣perty can command the votes of freeholders, and free∣men of towns, which send members to parliament, of course, they can appoint such members, and these mem∣bers will naturally give their vote as the person shall direct, to whom they owe their seat in the House of Commons. The King therefore will often bestow a
<PB N="129" REF="208"/>title upon the Gentleman who appoints those members, in order to obtain <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> votes; but titles are frequently given for services done to the State, for example, to great Statesmen, Generals, Admirals, and men learned in the Law. The Chancellor is always made a Peer, which generally adds two or three to the House of Lords every reign, and sometimes the Judges are made Peers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not at all wonder then, that men of great fortune are ambi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ious to be created Peers, if so much respect is due to their rank. Are there any more public offices besides those you have named?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, but the next are of lower order; I think the next is the <HI>Constable,</HI> of which there are two degrees, High and Petty: High Constables are appoint∣ed by the Bench of Justices at the Quarterly Sessions of the Peace, which are held quarterly at the principal town in the county, for the administration of justice in matters of small concern. They preside over a dis∣trict called a hundred, consisting of several parishes. Petty Constables are inferior officers in every town and parish, selected by the High Constables from the Pari∣shioners, and are subordinate to the High Constables. They are appointed by two Justices to serve one year: the duty of a Constable is to keep good order in the parish, and for this purpose he can take up disorderly persons, confine them and carry them before a Magi∣strate. This office is not held very reputable; and fre∣quently those that are appointed, for all must serve in their turn, will pay a fine or sum of money to be ex∣cused serving; in this case another takes the office.</P>
<P>The next public officers are the Surveyors of the High-way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>What are these?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Every parish is bound to keep the High Roads through it in repair, except the Turnpike Roads; and Surveyors are appointed to see this business pro∣perly done. There are generally two in every parish, appointed out of the substantial inhabitants, by two neighbouring Justices of the Peace.</P>
<P>The last officers I shall now mention are the Over∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ers of the Poor. Till the reign of Henry VIII. the
<PB N="130" REF="209"/>Poor subsisted throughout England upon private cha∣rity; but under Queen Elizabeth, Overseers in every parish were appointed from substantial housekeepers yearly, in Easter week, by two neighbouring Justices. Their duty is to raise money in the parish, by collecting from every one, in proportion to the rent of the house lives in, for the relief of their own Poor, who are not able to work, and to provide work for such as <HI>are</HI> able, and cannot get employ.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now you mention poor, Sir, I could wish to know what Gipsies are?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Gipsy is a corruption of Egyptian. These are a peculiar race of people, supposed to come origi∣nally from Egypt, and to be endowed with the gift of Prophecy; they made their appearance first in Germany, about 1517, but have been since banished from all parts of Europe. What are called Gipsies now are a set of vagabond poor, who live in the open air, wandering about in companies, from one part of the country to ano∣ther, pretending to tell silly people their fortunes, and subsisting wholly upon plunder: they are liable by our laws to be taken up, and if they have cheated any one of money, to be hanged.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have omitted to speak of the Church-Wardens.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall speak of them after I have menti∣oned the Clergy; for Church-Wardens are officers of the Church.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I beg your pardon; are you going to speak of the Clergy now?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am; the people are divided into two classes. The Clergy and the Laity. The Clergy being an order of men set apart to attend the service of God, have certain privileges allowed them. Among the rest, one is, not to be liable to serve temporal ofices, as Sheriff, Constable, Overseer, and the like; but then they have certain disabilities on account of their spiritual avocations; they are incapable of sitting in the House of Commons, nor can any Rector or Vicar take any lands to farm, or follow any way of business.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Some of the Clergy do hold farms not withstanding.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="131" REF="210"/>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>They are allowed to hold sufficient land to maintain their families, and under this pretence, will often buy and sell like other farmers, but they are liable to pay ten pounds a month to the King for so doing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Are there not several ranks of Clergymen?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Several. Archbishops, Bishops, Deans, Prebendaries, Archdeacons, Parsons, Vicars, and Cu∣rates.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Shall I trouble you to describe them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>England is divided into two provinces, over each of which presides an Archbishop. Three of the Bishopricks, Durham, Chester and Carlisle, are subject to the Bishop of York, and the other twenty-one to the Archbishop of Canterbury. An Archbishop is the head of the Clergy in his whole province, and governs the Bishops as well as the inferior Clergy. At the com∣mand of the King, he calls the Bishops and Clergy of his province to meet in convocation. All the Bishops have some livings more or less to give away among the Clergy, and when a Clergyman of any parish dies, of which the Church is in the gi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t of the Bishop, if the Bishop does not dispose of it in six months, the Archbishop has the giving of it away; he can grant a licence to a Clergyman, that is a master of Arts, in one of our Uni∣versities, to hold two livings, and he can grant special li∣cences to marry at any place or at any time; he has also the privilege of conferring a Doctor's or other degree in the same manner as do the Universities.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, cannot people be married when and where they please?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not without the Bishop's licence, which costs ten pounds. The laws obliges people to be married at their own Parish Church, and between eight and twelve in the morning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>You mentioned his calling the Clergy to convocation. What is that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Convocation is a Parliament in minia∣ture; the upper house, consisting of the Bishops, represents the House of Lords, in which the Archbishop of Can∣terbury presides as King, and with Royal State; the lower house is composed of representatives chosen by the Clergy, (Rectors and Vicars, in the several Archdea∣conries,
<PB N="132" REF="211"/>and by the Prebendaries of the several Cathe∣drals,) resembling the House of Commons with its Knights and Burgesses.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>What business do they do, and how often do they meet?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>They meet as often as the Parliament does, but meet only to disperse again, for they have no sooner chosen their Prolocutor or Chairman than the King prorogues them or prevents their continuance. They formerly settled the business of the church, but being found to enter into matters that did not concern them, the King has never suffered them to do any business since the year 1716. The form is still preferved, as be∣ing part of the constitution of this country. But to return.</P>
<P>A Bishop, as well as an Archbishop, besides the power of ordaining Clergymen and other holy ordinances, has authority to inspect the manners of the Laity as well as of the Clergy, and punish delinquents by ecclesiastical censures; to this end, they hold courts of Civil Law.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>How are Bishops appointed, and in what manner do their revenues arise?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Bishops and Archbishops are chosen by the Chapter of their Cathedrals, that is, by the Dean and Prebendaries belonging to the Cathedral; but they are obliged to choose such persons as the Kind recommends. Their revenues arise from the great tithes of several Vicarages in their gift, and from lands appropriated to the bishoprick.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>What are these tithes?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tithes are the tenth part of the produce of the lands lying in each parish, which time out of mind have been the property of the Rector or Parson of the parish, but for the maintenance of the Bishops, several of these Rectories have been converted into Vicarages, that is, the tithes have been divided, and the great tithes, as corn, hay, and such things as are most valuable, have been appropriated to the use of the Bishops, and the smaller tithes, as milk, fruit, &amp;c. have been settled on the Clergymen who served the Church, and whom the Bishop appoints; such Clergymen are called <HI>Vicars.</HI> Whereas such as have all the tithes of a parish, both
<PB N="133" REF="212"/>great and small, are called <HI>Rectors</HI> or Parson. Rectors also have generally some land annexed to their houses, the Vicars little or none; of course rectories are of great annual value, from forty pounds a-year, to 2000 hundred pounds a-year, and often not so much as twenty pounds.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>You tell me that the great tithes of a parish are the property of the Rector, how is it then that some have fallen into Lay hands? for I have a relation who gives away the living to a Clergyman, but who receives the great tithes himself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>This originated among the Friars before the Reformation, when there were societies of Roman Catholic Clergymen living together in one house, called <HI>Convents,</HI> as many now do in France and Spain, and other countries, in the same manner as I have told you the Fellows live together in the several Colleges in our Universities. By consent of the King they begged and bought all the Church livings within their reach, ap∣propriating the tithes to the use of themselves, and giving a Priest some small stipend, or the small tithes for serving the Church, who was thence called a Vicar, which means a substitute. Now at the Reformation, when the Popish religion was abolished, the monas∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eries were dissolved or broken up, and these appro∣priations or great tithes vested in the King, who afterwards granted them to private persons, not Clergy∣men, who have from time to time sold them or dis∣posed of them to whom they thought proper. These appropriations from being improperly in the hands of Lay-men, are called <HI>Impropriations.</HI> Crown lands and obey lands were ever exempt from paying tithes, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch lands therefore to this day continue tithe-free.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>What are first-fruits and tenths?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>The first fruits of living were the whole <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ofits of the first year, according to a rate settled in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>292, and originally paid to the Pope. The tenths were a tenth part of the annual income of each living <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the same valuation. At the Reformation the
y were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nexed to the Crown, and that valuation made, by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hich the Clergy are now rated; but by the bounty of
<PB N="134" REF="213"/>Queen Ann, all livings under fifty pounds a-year are discharged of these payments, and what others pay is vested in Trustees for ever, as a perpetual fund for the augmentation of poor livings.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I should like to know how it happened that several noblemen and gentlemen have one or more liv∣ings in their gift.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will explain this by and by: to do it now would be breaking in upon the order in which I proposed to describe to you, the several officers of the Church.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will interrupt you no more.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Before either Rectors or Vicars, I should have mentioned a Dean and Chapter. The Dean, with the Chapter of the Cathedral Church, (that is the Canons or Prebendaries, which are Clergymen that at∣tend the service of the Cathedral) are the Bishop's coun∣sel to assist him with advice in matters of religion, or the temporal concerns of his bishoprick; most of the Deans are appointed by the King, and some few by the Bishop of the diocese. It is the same with the Preben∣daries; some of whom are nominated by the King, and others by the Bishops.</P>
<P>The next person to be mentioned is the Archdea∣con. This is also a clerical officer, is subordinate to the Bishop of the diocese, and is appointed by the Bishop, but has a kind of episcopal authority independent of him. It is the province and duty of a Bishop to hold a visitation in the several parts of his diocese, that is to go round his bishoprick once in three years, to confirm the children, inspect the manners of the Clergy, so that the churches are kept in order, and that every reli∣gious instruction is properly attended. This I say th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Bishop does once in three yars, but the Archdeaco<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> does it every year, except the year the Bishop attend. The Archdeacon has also a court for trying spiritu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> offences, and punishing them with spiritual censures there are one or more Archdeacons in every bishop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> according to the extent of it.</P>
<P>Rectors and Vicars I have mentioned. The Cu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> is an officating Minister assisting the Rector or Vic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> for which be is paid a stipend of about fifty pounds year.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="135" REF="214"/>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is a small salary considering the great incomes of some livings. What do the revenues of Bishops and Deans generally amount to?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Archbishoprick of Canterbury is 10,000 pounds a-year, that of York 8000 pounds; and the several Bishops, including livings they sometimes hold, have from 7000 pounds to 2000 pounds. Deaneries are from about 1500 pounds a-year to about 200 pounds, and Prebends from about 700 pounds a-year to 50 pounds. So much then for the Clergy. I have now only to ex∣plain the inferior offices of the church, <HI>viz.</HI> Church-Wardens, Parish Clerks, and Sextons.</P>
<P>There are generally two Church-wardens chosen for every parish, one by the inhabitants, and one by the Rector or Vicar; these are the Guardians of the church, and the representatives of the body of pa∣rishioners. Their duty is to keep the church in repair, and collect money from the parishioners in proper pro∣portions for that purpose, and they with the Overseers have also the management of the poor.</P>
<P>Parish Clerks are generally appointed by the Rector or Vicar, and are sworn into their office by the Arch∣deacon; their duty is to attend the Minister in the offices of the church.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have been told that Parish Clerks are often Clergymen.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>In parishes where the office of Clerk is worth a Clergyman's notice, it is sometimes given to per∣sons in holy orders; but they never officiate as Clerk, but appoint a deputy to do the duty.</P>
<P>Sextons are persons that toll the bell, dig the graves, and keep the churches clean and quite during divine service.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now, Sir, you have gone through the whole, permit me to remind you of giving me an account, how the gift of livings fell into Lay hands, when I think, they should be in the disposal of the Bishop.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Though Lay-men may be the patrons of livings, that is, have the gift of the church, yet the Bishop has the examination of the persons appointed, whether he has sufficient learning, and whether he be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> man of good character or not. If he is found to be an
<PB N="136" REF="215"/>improper person, the Bishop can reject him, and Pa∣trons must nominate another. But now for an answer to your question.</P>
<P>To make you rightly understand the nature of <HI>Patro∣nage,</HI> I must first acquaint you with the origin of Manors.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am all attention.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Manors are as ancient as the Saxon Consti∣tution, which was general in this country before the year 1066, when it was conquered by King William I. A Manor consisted of a certain district or extent of land, (the extent of one or more parishes, or perhaps but part of one) the usual residence of the owner, and some part of which he kept n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ihis hands for the use of his family, the rest was distributed to tenants, who, for the use of the land, consented to do whatever the Lord of the Manor commanded him, so that they sometimes went out to war with him and fought for him, sometimes they cultivated the land he kept in his own hands, and did other services which he required of him. This was the state of the <HI>scodal</HI> system so much spoken of in history; men were then at the will of their Lord. Since that time certain indulgencies of Lords of Manors, cer∣tain constructions of law, and certain incroachments of the tenants have made some alteration in this, and though such tenants still hold their lands or estates at the will of the Lord, yet it is such a will as is agreeable to the custom of the Manor, which customs are pre∣served in the Court-roll of the Manor, and kept by the Stewards; and those tenants who have nothing to shew for their estates but admissions in consequence of such customs, witnessed by copies of entries in their posses∣sion made by the Stewards, are called <HI>Tenants by copy of Court-roll,</HI> and their estate is thence called a <HI>Copyhold:</HI> for such estates they pay a small annual sum by way of acknowledgement, perhaps a few shillings, called qui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣rent, and the Lord, when they die, takes generally the best beast such tenant possessed, this beast is called a <HI>heriot:</HI> Lords of Manors have it in their power to re∣lease such estates from heriots and quit-rent; in which case, the estate is called a Freehold, and the owner <HI>Freeholder,</HI> and these are the people who elect the Knight
<PB N="137" REF="216"/>of the shire to serve in Parliament, provided each man's Freehold is not less than forty shillings a-year.</P>
<P>Now, then, this understood, you will comprehend the nature of patronage. Great part of these Manors, as now, consisted of waste ground, and as Christianity spread, the Lords of these Manors began to build Churches on their wastes, for the accommodation of their tenants, and obliged those tenants to appropriate their tithes to the support of one officiating Minister, which before, were distributed among all the Clergy in the diocese; and this tract or extent of land, the tithes of which were so appropriated was called a parish: and because they built the Church, they were allowed to nominate a Minister, subject to his examination by the Bishop. This right of nomination is called an <HI>advowson,</HI> and is saleable like an estate, provided the Rector or Vicar is first appointed.</P>

The Adjutant 5s. Surgeon 6s. and the Chaplain 6s. 8d. The Drummer 2s. 3d. the Trumpe∣ter 2s. a Serjeant 2s. 9d. a Corporal 2s. 3d. and each private man 1s. 9d. The Colonel has the cloathing of his regiment, for which he is allowed sufficient to clean 5 or 600 pounds a year, after paying for the cloaths, and a Captain of a troop has also some perquisites. The Colonel of the two troops of Life-Guards attend upon the King at Court, on Court days, and their regiments are not worth less to each, all things considered, than 2000l pounds a year. A regiment of Dragoons, is con∣sidered worth 1500 pounds a year, and a regiment <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Foot, 1000 pounds a year in time of war, and about 700 pounds in time of peace.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>And why this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="139" REF="218"/>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because a regiment in time of war consists of 1000 men, and in time of peace of not above half the number, of course, if a Colonel gets 600 pounds a year by cloathing 1000 men, he can get but half the money by cloathing 500.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>How many regiments of Foot are there?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sometimes more and sometimes less. In peace there is about seventy-two regiments. In war about 120, besides three regiments of Foot Guards that are always a kept up, in war or peace, each regiment consisting of 3000 men; so that in war, reckoning 120 regiments of 1000 men each is 120,000 and 9000 Guards, but in time of peace the 120 regiments are reduced to about seventy-two of 500 each, that is about 36000 men.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>How are the regiments divided?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Into ten companies each. Each company has a Captain, a Lieutenant, and an Ensign, and over the whole there is a Colonel, a Lieutenant-Colonel and a Major. A company of Artillery has four Lieutenants.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have the Infantry no Chaplain?</P>
</SP>

<P>What is the pay of the Foot?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Foot Guards have better pay than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arching regiments; they continue in London which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a more expensive place than the country where other <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>egiments are quartered, and where owing to being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>artered or lodged at Public Houses, the officers can <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e cheaper; besides the uniform or cloaths of the of∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>cers of the Foot Guards is more expensive than those <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f marching regiments. The officers of the Foot Guards <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ave also better or more rank than officers of other re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ments. An Ensign of the Guards ranks or is upon an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uality with a Lieutenant of a marching regiment, a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eutenant of the Guards ranks as a Captain, and a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aptain of the Guards as a Lieutenant-Colonel, and is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lled Colonel.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is very little pay, how do they contrive to live upon it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is with difficulty. Indeed the officers sel∣dom do, they have generally small fortunes of their own. The army is a profession of honour rather than of profit, and so great is the eagerness of young men to get into it, that commissions are oftener purchased than given away. 350 pounds is the price given for an Ensigncy, and the pay is not more than about fifty pounds a year. In time of peace when regiments are quartered or settled in a country place, an Ensign can make shift to live upon his pay, the inns upon the roads are obliged to give him a bed and three good meals a day for one shilling, in which case he has two shillings and six-pence left for cloaths and other things: and as to the common Soldiers, the public houses are obliged by act of parliament to give them a lodging, small beer, fire, and utensils to dress their food, with salt, pepper, and vinegar for nothing, or to find them in victuals for four-pence a day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have heard say that the army is the best school in the world for young men; why is it so reckoned?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because they enter very early into it, and are brought up with high notions of honour, bravery and politeness to each other. There is such a discipline in the army that no officer dare contradict, dispute, or disobey the orders of a superior officer, tho' that officer shall perhaps be only an older Captain, or an older En∣sign, on pain of being tried by his brother officers for disobedience of orders, and of being punished, broke, and disgraced, if found guilty: a lad that is undutiful to his parents or masters, will be there soon taught subordination and obedience; he will learn to live upon six-pence a day, to bear heat and cold and fatigue, and never to commit a dishonourable action.</P>

<P>Is there no higher rank in the army than a Colonel?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Brigadier-Generals, Major-Generals, Lieutenant-Generals, Generals and Field Marshals, and last of all Commanders in Chief, who command the whole army, whereas, other Generals, in proportion to their rank, command only a branch of the army in the day of battle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is the pay fo these Generals?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>They have no pay but when employed. Admirals are always in pay, but Generals not. When they are paid, their pay is in proportion to their rank: from two pounds a day to ten pounds, which is the pay of the Commanders in Chief.</P>

<P>The Adjutant's business in to assist the Major, to deliver his orders, and to regulate the regimental accounts; that of the Quarter-Master to procure pro∣per accommodations for the men in quarters and camp, and to keep every thing in order.

<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is an officer ever promoted in the army by seniority?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sometimes; particularly if he is abroad in service, in time of war. If a Lieutenant dies, or is killed, the eldest Ensign of the same regiment will come in youngest Lieutenant; if a Captain dies, or is killed, the eldest Lieutenant will now and then succeed, but this succession will not often take place in officers of higher rank than Captains; it will require interest and recom∣mendation, as for great attention to duty, some gallant act of bravery or the like. When an officer once ge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s the rank of Colonel, his rank goes on, and no Colonel is put over his head. All the Colonels of the same standing are made Majors-Generals together, and all Major-Generals of the same standing, Lieutenant-Generals a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the same time; but it does not follow that because a man is a General he is to be employed as such. The King singles out for a command such as he thinks are men of the best abilities and heroism.</P>

<P>Have there not been instances of privat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Soldiers obtaining in course of time great rank in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> army?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>There have been some few instances of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> kind. The late Generals, Bland and Salter, were one common soldiers. An industrious man in the Guard may by the favour of his Colonel soon be appointed Serjeant; it is then his d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ty to teach the men their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣erene; and if they are clever and expert at this, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> new regiments are raised, they generally give one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> two of such men commissions, in each of those n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> raised regiments, in order to exercise the men and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> they are properly disciplined. When the 79th re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣ment
<PB N="143" REF="222"/>was raised in the last war, there were seven Ser∣jeants taken from the Guards and made Lieutenants of that regiment, though they had never been Ensigns, a Serjeant of the Guards being almost considered upon an equality of rank with an Ensign of a marching regi∣ment; but this was a singular circumstance. When once they are in commission, it is easy to see, that in time of action, something may happen to forward their promotion.</P>

<P>Is there any provision for disabled Soldiers, as there is for disabled seamen?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>When a soldier has served twenty years, he is entitled to be an out-pensioner of Chelsea Hospital, for which he receives about seven pounds a year, and is at liberty to set up his trade in any town in the king∣dom, which no man else can, unless he be a freeman of those towns; and if he is unable by wounds to get his living, and is desirous of being taken into the Hospital wholly, he will be received, lodged, cloathed and main∣tained for the rest of his life; but sometimes in time of war, when soldiers are wanted to go abroad, they will se∣lect the most able of the out-pensioners to serve in Forts and Garrisons within the kingdom. Indeed the Gar∣risons of Great Britain are chiefly manned with invalids of which there are twenty-six companies; and officers who have lost a leg or an arm in the service, are gene∣rally removed to them, where they live comfortably the remainder of their days.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is there no provision for their widows, if they are killed in battle?</P>

<P>None. The widows of officers have pen∣sions after their death, whether they are killed in battle or not. A Colonel's widow has 50l. a year, a Major's 40l. a Lieutenant-Colonel's 35l. a Major's 30l a Cap∣tain's 25l. a Lieutenant's 20l. an Ensign's 15l. and a Chaplain's and Surgeon's 20l. each.</P>

<PB N="144" REF="223"/>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Artillery is employed in firing of can∣non, and throwing of bombs.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know what a cannon is, but do not rightly understand the nature of a bomb.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>A bomb is an iron shell, hollow within, filled with combustible matter, with a fuse or artificial fire, communicating with the contents of the shell, and which takes fire without, when shot out of a mortar, or piece, something resembling a cannon. It is designed to be shot into towns and forts, and is so contrived, that the fu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e which burns all the way it goes, shall set fire to the contents of the bomb as soon as it falls to the ground and burst it into a thousand pieces, which will destroy and fire every thing within its reach. The sol∣diers generally see them as they fly in the air, and avoid them when they can; they are thrown into forts like a cannon ball, by the force of gun-powder.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>How many regiments of Artillery are there?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Only one, which consists of four batallions, whose province it is to work mortars, great guns or can∣nons, spring mines, throw bridges over rivers and other such things.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not comprehend what you mean by springing of mines.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>A mine is a subterraneous passage dug un∣der the wall or rampart of a fortified town, designed to be blown up with gun-powder, when the enemy is pas∣sing over it.</P>

<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is there any difference between the Artil∣lery and the Engineers?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>The corps of Engineers is a part of the Ar∣tillery; their business is to contrive attacks at sieges and defend towns when besieged. This corps has one Co∣lonel, two Lieutenants-Colonels, four Majors, twenty-four Captains, and thirty-eight Lieutenants.</P>

<P>About eight or nine, and these generally consist of such of the Privy Council as bear the great offices of State. The First Lord of the Treasury. The Lord Chancellor. The Lord President of the Council. The First Lord of the Admiralty. The Chancellor of the Exchequer. The Secretary of War. The Commander in Chief of the Army, (when there is one) and the two Secretaries of State; but the First Lord of the Treasury is the ostensible Minister; and if these gentlemen should advise the King to any wrong measure, they are liable to be called to an account for it by the Parliament, (which is called <HI>impeaching</HI> them) and to be punished, even to the loss of life. Have you any more questions to ask?</P>

<P>Oh, yes, a great many, I want, among other things, to know what a siege is, and the nature of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is in sieges that the artillery are chiefly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mployed. When a fort of fortified town, that is, a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>own round which thick walls are built, and great ditches <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ug, to defend it against the approach of an enemy; then such a strong place is attacked, it is said to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esieged, and the business of the besiegers is to get into, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd take possession of such fort or town.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is a fort and a fortified town the same thing?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>No. A fort is merely a place walled and ditched <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>und like a fortified town, for the shelter and security of a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>mber of soldiers, and, like that, is called a <HI>garrison.</HI> A <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>all number of soldiers from such a place, can occasionally <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ly or go out and annoy the enemy and retire within the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> again, and be safe; it is therefore I say, the business of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e besiegers to drive this garrison out and take possession <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the place. For this purpose, artillery are employed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> both sides, that is, bombs are thrown, and cannon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d, those from the besiegers to knock down the walls, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> destroy the fort; those from the besieged to drive
<PB N="146" REF="225"/>away the enemy, by firing on them from the walls. If the besiegers can make a breach in any part of the walls, they will rush in and take the fort by force. This is called <HI>storming</HI> it. If they cannot do this, they will cut off all communication with the fort, either by sea or land, by carefully watching that no persons shall go out of it, nor any provisions, ammunition, or other assistance be taken in, and by this means, in a length of time, they will starve them out, and oblige them to surrender; for when their provisions or ammunition is gone, they can hold out no longer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>And are things always carried to such extre∣mities?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>No. The besieged generally surrender, if overpowered, before things are brought to the utmost extremity; for the General of the besiegers always sends to the Commanding Officer of the Fort, and tells him that if he does not surrender, he will shew to Garrison no quarter, that is, if he is obliged to get possession by force, he will put every man to death; should they hold out to the last, they lie wholly at the mercy of their enemy. If the besieged are driven off or think proper to desist from their enterprize, they are said to raise the siege.</P>

</SP>
<SP>

<P>They will sometimes, as the Romans did, shoot a letter upon the point of an arrow from one to the other, or a party will advance from the chief body of the enemy, with a flag, which is called a flag of truce; this is generally seen by the other party, and is known to be the signal for a parley or conference.</P>

<HEAD>DISCOURSE IX. OF THE COURTS OF LAW AND THEIR OFFICERS.</HEAD>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>HAVE you, my dear Eugenius, a right com∣prehension of the Courts of Law?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very far from it; it would give me pleasure to have them properly explained.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall not enter into a minute detail of them; but content myself with saying only so much as will give you a general idea of the principal of them, which are four; (for there are several that will be unnecessary to burthen your memory with) we will begin with the lowest.</P>
<P>The first then is the court of Common Pleas, calcu∣lated to redress injuries, committed by one man upon the property of another, in any part of the: kingdom.
<PB N="150" REF="229"/>It was established in Westminster Hall by King John, in 1216, where it has continued ever since. The Judges of this Court are four in number; the Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, and three <HI>puisne,</HI> or Under Judges, who sit every day in Term time, to hear and determine all matters of law, arising in civil causes, real or personal.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is meant by civil causes?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>By civil causes are meant all infringements upon property, carried on or prosecuted by the person injured, in contradistinction to criminal causes, which are considered as breaches of the peace, and though commenced by the party aggrieved, are carried on in the King's name, as the chief magistrate and enforcer of the Laws.</P>
<P>The Court of King's Bench is the next (so called, because the King used to sit there in person) and is the Supreme Court of Common Law, in the kingdom. It has also four Judges, a Chief Justice, and three <HI>puisne</HI> ones.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did the King sit in that Court as a Judge?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>He sat there, as he is supposed to do now, but was not empowered to determine any cause, but by the mouth of his Judges.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is the authority of that Court?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>This has the superintendance of all Civil Corporations, commands Magistrates and others to do what their duty requires, protects the liberty of the people; hears and determines both in criminal and civil causes, and is a Court to which we may appeal against all determinations of the Court of Common Pleas, and other inferior Courts.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>You mentioned Common Law, what it understood by this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Common Law implies whatever has been customary throughout the kingdom; is perhaps as old as the kingdom itself, and the term is used to distinguish it from those Laws established by Act of Parliament, and which are therefore called <HI>Statute</HI> Law.</P>
<P>There is another principal Court of Law, called the Court of Exchequer, which is a Court of Equity too and was established originally to recover debts due to the King: people may, however, apply to this Cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
<PB N="151" REF="230"/>for redress such grievances, as they generally apply to the Court of Chancery for. There are four Judges also of this Court, called Barons of the Exchequer; a Lord Chief Baron, and three others.</P>
<P>But the fourth and last, is the High Court of Chancery, the most important of all in matters of civil property. Here the Lord Chancellor sits as Judge, and determines the matter by his own decree; whereas, in the Courts of King's Bench and Common Pleas, the matter is heard and determined by a Jury of twelve men. But if a man thinks himself aggrieved, even by a decree of the Chan∣cellor, in the Court of Chancery, he may refer his cause to the decision of the House of Lords, where it may be re-heard.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is it you mean by a Jury of twelve men?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is esteemed one of the greatest privi∣leges of a British subject, that of being tried, or having his cause determined by twelve indifferent persons, chosen by him out of forty-eight respectable men, of his own country, who are summoned for that purpose; by which means the decision is not left to the determination of the Judge alone, who might possibly be thought partial.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think you said the Court of King's Bench had the superintendance of all Civil Corporations; I wish to know the nature of a Corporation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Corporations are bodies of man united, by a Charter or Privilege from the Crown, for the purpose of protecting their own rights, or the rights of the Com∣munity to which they belong. They are empowered to make certain laws of regulation among themselves, and to enforce the execution of them, if they be not contrary to the laws of the land. Cities and all Borough towns that send members to Parliament, are towns corporate or little republicks, and the Mayor and Aldermen of such corporate bodies are generally Magistrates, within the limits of the Corporation.</P>
<P>The Corporation of the City of London, like that of other towns, consists of three branches. The Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Common Council; in imitation of King, Lords, and Commons. The City is divided into twelve wards, and each ward elects an Alderm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.
<PB N="152" REF="231"/>and a certain number of Common Council. The Alder∣men meet by themselves, and so do the Common Council, and thus between them, the business of the Corporation is adjusted.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why is the Mayor of London called Lord Mayor?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>By a particular privilege, the Mayors of London, York, and Dublin, have the title of Lord for the year they serve; which the Mayors of other towns have not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>What are those Courts that are held in the Country, I mean the Assizes?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>They are a kind of Assistant Courts, sent by the King's Special Commission twice a year all round the King's dominions. Their business is to try by a Jury of the respective counties such causes as must otherwise be brought up to Westminster. Thus for the case of the subject, justice is brought home to every man's door; disputed facts are tried, if required, in the country, by neighbours; and criminals are prosecuted, where the witnesses are near at hand to attend.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Are there no other Courts of consequence?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes. The Court of Admiralty is one, at which the Lord High Admiral or his Deputy presides. This Court is held three or four times a year at the Old Bailey, in London, and one of the Judges generally acts as the Lord Admiral's deputy. It tries all offences committed on the seas, or in parts out of the reach of the Common Law Courts.</P>
<P>There are Courts also for trying Ecclesiastical causes, and there is the Prerogative Court for the trial of wills the Judge of which is appointed by the Archbishop of Canterbury.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now you mention wills; shall I trouble you to tell me the office of an Executor.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Executor is generally some friend o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the deceased, appointed by him, in his will, to execut<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> what is there directed; to dispose of the effects, and dis∣tribute the property, according to the will of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> testator.</P>

<P>Suppose he does not chuse to undertake it what is then done?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="153" REF="232"/>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>The next of kin, in such case, will admi∣nister, that is, apply to the Bishop's Court, and take out what is called <HI>Letters of Administrations,</HI> which are granted by the Bishop for that purpose, and who will then take care that the tenor of the Will is properly complied with. But to go on, Besides the Courts I have mentioned, there are little Courts in almost every county town throughout England, called <HI>Courts of Conscience,</HI> for the recovery of debts under forty shillings.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Who are the principal people employed in these Courts?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>The three chief parties on a trial are the Plaintiff, that is, the complainant; the Defendant, or the party complained against, and the Judge; but in the principal Courts, there are Attornies and Counsel, as Assistants.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is the office of an Attorney?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>An Attorney at Law, in civil Courts, is as the Proctor in the Ecclesiastical Courts, a person whom the Plaintiff or Defendant appoints to appear for him, and manage and conduct his cause. These Attorney<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> are now formed into a regular body, and when admitted to the execution of their office by the Courts of West∣minster Hall, are officers of those Courts who admit them, and can practise in no other.</P>
<P>Of Counsel there are two degrees, Barristers and Serjeants. Barristers, after they have been admitted five years, in any of the Inns of Court, such as the Temple, Lincoln's Inn, &amp;c. that is, after five year standing, are called to the bar: and after sixteen years standing, they may be called to the degree of Serjeants. The Judges are always admitted Serjeants, before they are made Judges. Out of these Barristers of Serjeants, the King's Counsel are usually selected, the two principal of whom are called his Attorney and Sollicitor-General, who are always Members of Parliament.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have the King's Counsel any particular privilege?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>They are employed always in Crown causes, but can be employed in no cause against the Crown, without special Licence. They are heard always before other Counsel, and even before Serjeants.</P>

<PB N="154" REF="233"/>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is merit in this profession ever the means of promotion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>It seldom is in the church, and seldom in the army, but almost always here; they must have able men and good speakers for Judges, and for the Attorney and Solicitor-General; but of two able men, he who has most interest, is commonly preferred. From common Barristers, they are promoted to be King's Counsel, and from King's Counsel, generally to be Masters in Chan∣cery and Judges. Such of the Counsel, as are appointed to be Solicitor and Attorney-General to the King, generally come to be Chief Justices or Lord Chancellor. The Solicitor-General is commonly promoted to the office of Attorney General, and thence to be either Chief Justice or Lord Chancellor, which seldom fails to procure him a peerage. For the Lord Chancellor does not usually continue long in office.</P>

<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Was I to chuse my profession then, it should be that of a Barrister.</P>
</SP>

<P>You must be first a man of abilities, and a good Orator: for without these a Counsel makes but a poor figure and he may be never heard of as long as he lives; but if he is a sensible man, a good Lawyer, and a good Orator, from being at the Bar, he may get into Parlia∣ment; and there, by his eloquence, may carry every thing before him, and arrive at the highest honours.</P>

<P>They are as follow. The Trojan war. The nature of Magna Charta, the Habeas Corpus Bill, the Navigation Act, Naturalization, Morgages, Patents, and Passports.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is very proper you should understand them all, and I will explain them to you one after the other. The first, I think, is the Trojan war?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you please?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>The siege of Troy, though founded on fact, is so enveloped in fable, that the whole has, by some, been considered as fabulous. It is made the subject of an Heroic Poem, written in Greek, by Homer, the first of Poets, who lived nine hundred years before the birth of Christ. To give you a complete account of it, you should first be acquainted with the Heathen Mytho∣logy, or the fabulous Deities of Antiquity. However, I will give you the best notion of it I can.</P>
<P>The City of Troy was situated in that part of Phrygia, adjoining the Bosphorus of Thrace, which is now called the Straits of Constantinople, and flourished about one thousand two hundred years before Christ. We are told that Hecuba, the wife of Priam, King of Troy, when with child of Paris, dreamed that she was brought to bed of a flaming torch, which, being construed by an Oracle, who was supposed to have the gift of prophecy, to imply that the child of which she was big, would, one day, be the ruin of his country and his family; her husband Priam, ordered him, when born, to be put to death; but Hecuba secreted him, and had him brought up by a shepherd. Many years afterwards, Paris who
<PB N="156" REF="235"/>was unacquainted with his birth, came to Troy, to con∣tend for a prize, which the king proposed to give among his young nobility, and won it. Hector, the eldest son of Priam, enquiring about this young man, soon found him to be his brother. King Priam received him, ac∣knowledged him, and gave him that rank that was his due. Some time after, Paris having been at Sparta to recover his aunt Hesione whom Hercules had run away with, took away be force Helena the wife of Menelaus, king of that city, and swore he would never return her till his aunt Hesione was returned. The Grecian princes round about, took part with Menelaus, and engaged themselves by oath never to lay down their arms, till they had overthrown the city of Troy.</P>
<P>The Grecian army was conducted by 95 leaders, kings, princes, or heroes much celebrated at that time for singular atchievements. And Agamemnon, king of Argos and Mycene, was declared commander in chief. Among the Grecian leaders were Nestor, Achilles, and Patroclus his friend, Ajax, son of Telamon, the other Ajax, Idomeneus, Diomedes, Ulysses and Palimedos. Their fleet was composed of 2190 vessels.</P>
<P>The superb city of Troy was defended by the all the princes of Asia, and who to equal the forces of Greece, assembled a very powerful army. They were commanded also by very valiant princes, and by all the sons of Priam (which were 50 in number) the eldest of which was Hector, who alone could have sustained and re∣pulsed all the efforts of the enemy, had fate not de∣stined it to the contrary. The Trojans were every where conquerors under this hero; they drove the Greeks from every part, and burnt their fleet, so that they repented of their expedition; for Achilles was offended with Agamemnon, and had with-drawn him∣self, which changed the face of things. In this gene∣ral discomfiture, Patroclus the friend of Achilles, anxious to recal their good fortune, took the arms of Achilles, and put himself at the head of the Grecian army, repulsed the Trojans and challenged Hector to single combat. Hector advanced, and Pa∣troclus fell a sacrifice to his sword. Achilles then, ex∣asperated
<PB N="157" REF="236"/>at the death of his friend, forgot the offence of Agamemnon, attacked the Trojan hero, killed him, tied him to his chariot wheels, and dragged him round the walls of Troy and the grave of his friend Patro∣clus.</P>
<P>The death of Hector was as great a loss to the Tro∣jans, as the retreat of Achilles had been to the Greeks. Priam demanded a truce or cessation of arms for some days, during which time he went with part of his family and some rich presents, to request of Achilles the dead body of his son, that he might bestow upon him the last honours. Achilles, moved with the tears of Po∣lixena, Hector's sister, whose beauty had smitten him, yielded to Priam's request. Paris, profited by this cir∣cumstance, and revenged his brothers death; he promised Achilles to give him his sister in marriage, and kept his word, and they were scarce assembled in the temple to solemnize the marriage, than Paris took an opportunity to murder Achilles.</P>
<P>Enraged at this, Pyrrhus, the son of Achilles, came with a considerable re-enforcement, and joined the Greeks to revenge the death of his father. But the oracle having declared, that Troy never would be taken whilst it possessed the <HI>Palladium,</HI> (which was a statue of Pallas the goddess of war, superstitiously supposed to have descended from heaven and to have placed her∣self upon the altar) Diomedes and Ulysses took upon them to take it away, which they did with great clever∣ness.</P>
<P>The Greeks however not being able to make them∣selves masters of the city by force, undertook to surprise it. They pretended that Minerva had punished them for taking her from the Palladium, and after ten years siege, in which it had cost them the lives of so many great and illustrious men, they had recourse to this strata∣gem. They constructed a wooden horse, in the belly of which they shut up a great number of armed soldiers, and concealed it in the island of Tenedos: they gave but that they built this horse as an atonement for the injury they had done Minerva. The Trojans, on the Greeks leaving it, crowded round the figure, and se∣duced
<PB N="158" REF="237"/>by a vain hope, which was heightened by one Sinon, whom the Greeks instructed to say, that if that horse was conveyed within the walls of Troy, it would thence forth be impregnable; seduced, I say, by this story, they instantly proceeded to make a breach in the walls, and introduced this fatal machine. This day, which was the last of Troy, became a day of merriment, in which each man gave way to the blind transports of folly. Night came on, and when the whole city was at rest, wrapt up in fatal security, the Grecian soldiers opened the sides of the horse, and under cover of the night, spread themselves in all quarters of the city, to which they set fire, and the flames was a signal to the enemy, who entered by the breach, and put all to the sword. The Trojans made a desperate defence, and did not yield till they were overpowered by num∣bers. Pyrrhus in particular committed unheard-of cruelties. He broke into Priam's palace and slew the prince and all his family at the foot of the altar where they had fled for refuge. Polixenes was considered as the cause of Achilles's death: her, Pyrrhus sacrificed upon the <HI>tumulus</HI> or tomb which the Greeks had raised to his memory; Andromache, Hector's wife, had con∣cealed her son Aslyanax in the tomb of that hero; Ulysses found him out, and threw him down from the top of a high tower; Pyrrhus took Andromache to Epirus afterwards and married her.</P>
<P>Such was the sad fate of the proud city of Troy, which took place in the year 1180 before, Christ. She saw perish before he walls 886,000 Greeks, and within her bosom 670,000 of her own citizens.</P>

<P>Magna Charta is the great charter of liberty which the barons, that is, the nobility of this country, being at war with King John, compelled him to sign, in the year 1215. Under all despotic governments, the king not only makes free with the purses of his subjects, but also with their persons; that is, will not only take away their property when he has occasion for it, but will imprison them at his pleasure. By signing this charter, king John renounced for ever, in the name of the kings of this country, all such arbitrary measures, and acquiesced to such terms as to this day have se∣cured the liberties of the subject. The Habeas Corpus bill, and act passed in the reign of king Charles II. is one of the glorious consequences of this great charter.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>By virtue of this act of parliament, no man can be imprisoned without knowing the cause of such imprisonment, and having his case fairly argued in a court of justice. In all illegal confinements the pri∣soner may have a writ of Habeas Corpus, directed to the person detaining him, and requiring him to take him before a court or before a judge, within 20 days of the writ being delivered: if a judge refuses to grant such a writ, he forfeits 500l. to the prisoner: if the keeper of a prison refuses to obey, the forfeits 100l. for the first offence, and 200l. for the second. If when his case is argued, he be acquitted, he cannot be imprisoned again for the same offence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>This certainly is but just.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is however what no country but this can boast of. What is your next question?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Navigation Act.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Great Britain being an island, its whole war∣like strength depends upon its marine, or its power by sea. As a nursery for seamen, therefore, the fisheries were established, and every encouragement is given to foreign commerce, and with the same view the naviga∣tion act was passed, during the republican government of this kingdom, when the parliament had put king Charles to death. By this act, not merchandize can be imported into England, but in English ships of which
<PB N="160" REF="239"/>the master and three-fourths of the crew must be Eng∣lish subjects; except it be in the ships of that Euro∣pean country, of which the merchandize is the growth or manufacture.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why was this exception made?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>To encourage foreigners to trade with us, for it would have been hard to have obliged them to hire English vessels to bring here the goods of their own country. All we wished to prevent was, that no other nation should be the carriers of our merchan∣dize: it was America chiefly we had an eye to, and the people there, before their independence, could send nothing here but in English vessels.—What is your next question?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>The nature of Naturalization.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>To naturalize a man is to give him the pri∣vilege of a subject born in this kingdom. Neither a Jew nor a foreigner can purchase an estate in this country, nor inherit one from his ancestors; but when he is naturalized he can, and foreigners pay more du∣ties on imports and exports than natural born subjects.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Can all be naturalized that please?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes. If they chuse to be at the expence of an act of parliament, which they cannot be with∣out receiving the sacrament according to the Church of England, and taking the oaths of supremacy and al∣legiance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>What are these oaths?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>By the oath of allegiance, the man swears loy∣alty and fidelity to his King; and by the oath of supre∣macy, he abjures the Pope, and acknowledges the King to be the head of the Church.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>What in the expence of an act of parlia∣ment?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>About 300l. To encourage the Jews, who are a very trading people, to settle with us in prefer∣ence to other countries, some years ago a general na∣turalization bill was passed to reach to all under certain restrictions; but the people of England were so aver<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> to it, that had not the parliament immediately re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ealed it, they would have knocked the Jews on th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>
<PB N="161" REF="240"/>head. They went so far as to kill one or two at North∣ampton.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>The other things I wish to know are Mort∣gages, Patents, and Passports.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Passports are letters of safe conduct, granted under the King's seal to subjects of a foreign power, with whom we are at war; for without such a passport, they cannot pass safely in this country from place to place, nor can they convey their merchandize at sea, from port to port, without its being liable to be seized.</P>
<P>Patents are exclusive privileges granted by the King to the author of any new invention, to have to fole manufacturing and vending of the said invention for fourteen years.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Can any one obtain a Patents?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Any one the applies for it, on his swearing that he is the original inventor. But it is in the breast of the King to refuse it, if he thinks proper.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is the expence of obtaining one?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>About fourscore pounds.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now, Sir, for Mortgages, and I will make my bow.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>A Mortgage is, when a man borrows of another a certain sum of money, and grants him an estate, on condition that if he repays the money on a certain fixed day, the person holding the estate shall return it to its former owner. The person borrowing the money is called the <HI>Mortgagor,</HI> and the person lend∣ing it the <HI>Mortgagee.</HI> There is another article which you have not enquired about, but which is equally necessary for you to know.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is that, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ERAST.</SPEAKER>
<P>The nature of the Mortmain Act. When Popery was the established religion of this country, it was customary for the Monks to persuade persons on their death beds, by alarming arguments, to leave part, if not the whole, of their property, to the convent to which they belonged; and they so often succeeded, as to become proprietors of very considerable estates, which were thus perpetually inherent in one <HI>dead hand.</HI> To prevent this, many laws from time to time have been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ade; and no person now can leave, by will any sur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
<PB N="162" REF="241"/>of money to a charitable use, unless it be bequeathed and enrolled in Chancery twelve months before the death of the testator.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Accept my best thanks for the information you have given, me, and you shall see that I will profit by it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EUGEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do this, my dear Eugenius, and I am amply gratified.</P>
