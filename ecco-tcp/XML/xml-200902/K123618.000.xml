<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IN writing a History of the <HI>Union,</HI> it could not be reasonably ex∣pected, that I should go any farther than the Finishing, Ratify∣ing and Exchanging the Treaty in the Respective Parliaments of the two Nations to be United—and this I think I have Finished in the following Sheets.</P>
<P>However, since the Work has lyen longer in the Press than I at first Expected; and some Remarkable things have in Consequence of, and very much Depending upon the <HI>UNION</HI> happened since, I could not Satisfy my self, without giving a short Abridgement of the State of Things, between the Time of Finishing the Treaty, and the Publica∣tion of this Work, which tho it be rather a Kind of Summary Reca∣pitulation of things, than a Historical Narration, may yet be Equally Profitable to him that shall Enquire into the Affairs of the United Kingdoms at that Time.</P>
<P>The Union took Place, as has been Noted the 1st of <HI>May</HI> 1707, The Management of the Revenue, the Trials in the <HI>Exchequer</HI> and <HI>Admirality,</HI> were all Settled on a New Foot, Commissioners of the <HI>Customs, Excise</HI> and <HI>Equivalent,</HI> were appointed; Judges of the Court of <HI>Exchequer;</HI> a New <HI>Admirality,</HI> and their respective Offices were all fix'd; the Coin was Reformed, and entirely Reduc'd to the <HI>English</HI> Standard <HI>(the small Copper Money only Excepted)</HI> Weights and Measures were Regulated in part, and the respective Alterations and Models, whether in Government, or Commerce, Enacted by the <HI>Union,</HI> began every where to be put in Practice.</P>
<P>The <HI>British Parliament</HI> had been Assembled at <HI>Westminster,</HI> ac∣cording to the Treaty, and had been Concluded with a General Satis∣faction; And Her Majesty began to see the Compleat End of Her Wishes, in the <HI>Union</HI> being actually Consummated; The <HI>Northern Peers</HI> and <HI>Commons Sitting,</HI> and that too with a General Satisfaction and Applause in that <HI>First Parliament</HI> of <HI>Great Britain.</HI></P>
<P>In this <HI>Parliament,</HI> several Things were done for the <HI>better Improv∣ing,</HI> and as it was Called then, <HI>Rendring more Effectual,</HI> the <HI>UNION,</HI> particularly that of Dissolving the <HI>Privy Council,</HI> Re-establishing the 
<PB N="ii" REF="3"/>
<HI>Sessions</HI> of the <HI>Peace</HI> by <HI>Justices,</HI> &amp;c. Settling the <HI>Militia,</HI> and mak∣ing <HI>Lord Lieutenants, Deputy Lieutenants,</HI> &amp;c. in every County <HI>as in England;</HI> of all which particular Mention is made in the fol∣lowing Sheets—, several Regulations also in <HI>Trade</HI> were made here, for the Ease of <HI>North Britain;</HI> particularly the Removing the Difficul∣ties of bringing Foreign Imported <HI>Goods</HI> from <HI>Scotland</HI> to <HI>England,</HI> and the great Debate about the <HI>Wine, Brandy,</HI> &amp;c. brought into <HI>Scot∣land,</HI> in the Interval between the Finishing, and Effectual taking Place of the <HI>Union,</HI> was put to an End, entirely in the Favour of <HI>Scotland,</HI> every thing being Cleared at once, and all Interruptions of <HI>Commerce</HI> thereby Removed.</P>
<P>But in the Middle of all this <HI>Harmony,</HI> an Accident interveen'd, which if it had not been Mercifully prevented by the immediate Inter∣position of a <HI>Divine Power,</HI> had at once Unravelled all this happily finished <HI>Constitution,</HI> and that in a manner that the most Violent <HI>Op∣poser</HI> of the <HI>Union,</HI> could not in his warmest Thoughts have honestly wished to have seen.</P>
<P>This was the <HI>French Invasion;</HI> which Endangered not the <HI>Union</HI> only, but bid fair for Overturning the whole Frame of the present <HI>Establishment</HI> in <HI>Church</HI> and <HI>State,</HI> tearing up the very Foundation of our <HI>Constitution,</HI> I mean the <HI>Revolution;</HI> and Restoring, not only <HI>Tyranny</HI> and <HI>Arbitrary Government,</HI> but even <HI>Popery</HI> it self, that had so many Years since, and at such Expence of Blood and Treasure been Dethroned in <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>I shall need to bring very few Arguments to prove this, to have been the immediate Consequence of the Success of this Expedition, after I have given a Summary Account of the Matter of Fact, which is briefly as follows.</P>
<P>About <HI>January</HI> 1707, frequent Advices from <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Flanders,</HI> gave the <HI>Government</HI> Notice, That the <HI>French</HI> were making great Preparations at <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> for some secret Expedition; upon far∣ther Search into the Matter of Fact, it appeared that several Men of War were fitting out there with the utmost Expedition, and unusual Quantities of Arms and Ammunition providing, with a large Train of Artillery; which were all to be Shipped forthwith on Board the Ships fitting up as above.</P>
<P>These Advices were still Seconded with others, till at last the <HI>French</HI> themselves making it no longer a Secret, and some of the Men of War being ready, they Ordered the Stores, Arms and Ammunition to be actually Shipped on Board, drew their Troops down to the Shore, and Openly Declared that this Expedition was Designed for <HI>Scotland,</HI> to Re-instate the King of <HI>Great Britain, So they Stiled the Pretender,</HI> in the Possession of his Lawful <HI>Dominions,</HI> as <HI>they Called them,</HI> and this they said was done at the Earnest Request of his Subjects in that Kingdom.</P>
<P>It is true, and <HI>most People thought it reasonable to judge,</HI> that it was not probable, the King of <HI>France</HI> would Embark in a Design of so Great Consequence, had he not received Invitations from <HI>Scotland:</HI> Howe∣ver, the Design not Succeeding, those Correspondences never came to
<PB N="iii" REF="4"/> be effectually discover'd; And therefore the <HI>House of Lords</HI> in their Address to <HI>Her Majesty</HI> take Notice, That the King of <HI>France</HI> making an Attempt to invade <HI>Her Majesties</HI> Dominions with such a contemptible Force, was a sufficient Evidence that he must have Encouragment from some Person in <HI>Scotland</HI> disaffected to <HI>Her Majesties Government.</HI></P>
<P>However, The strictest Inquisition after these Correspondencies could never make any considerable Discovery, tho many Persons were taken up, which seemed to be owing rather to the Miscarriage of the Design, the <HI>French</HI> never coming on Shore with any <HI>Forces,</HI> and their Friends on Shore being too politick to show themselves till they saw their Troops on Shore, and in some Posture and Condition to protect them;—There were several Gentlemen taken up upon general Suspicions, which however it gave some Offence to the People, yet was thought necessary at that time, <HI>of which by and by.</HI></P>
<P>About the End of <HI>February,</HI> these Preparations of the <HI>French</HI> were come to such a Height, and the Design of invading <HI>Scotland so out of doubt,</HI> that the <HI>Government</HI> here thought it high Time to prepare for the Defence of <HI>Scotland:</HI> And to that Purpose, <HI>Her Majesty</HI> wrote a Letter to the <HI>Privy Council</HI> in <HI>Scotland (which, tho determined to expire by an Act of Parliament, yet was in Being, and had Power to act, till the first Day of</HI> May <HI>following.)</HI> In this Letter, <HI>Her Majesty</HI> gave them Notice that she had received Information of an <HI>Intended Invasion</HI> back'd with a <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Popish Power,</HI> design'd against <HI>Scotland</HI> in Favour of the <HI>Pretender;</HI>—And therefore recommended to them the Security of the Kingdom, the Preservation of the publick Peace, and that they would use all possible Means to that Effect.</P>
<P>In the mean Time, Vigorous Preparations were made in <HI>England</HI> for preventing the Designs of the <HI>French,</HI> as well by equipping a Fleet to inter∣cept them at Sea, and so prevent their Landing; as by providing Forces to give them a warm Reception, in case they should land in <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>I know there were Complaints made, and Endeavours used to expose the Conduct of the <HI>Government</HI> in their Preparations; suggesting, That due Care was not taken to put <HI>Scotland</HI> in a Posture of Defence in case the <HI>French</HI> had landed: and a certain <HI>Noble Person</HI> caused the Letters of the <HI>E.</HI> of <HI>Leven</HI> the <HI>General</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> which were written in the midst of that <HI>Hurry,</HI> and in which his <HI>Lordship</HI> wrote in pressing Terms for Assistance, to be Printed;—But when these Things came to be Examin'd in <HI>Parliament,</HI> it appeared otherwise than those Gentlemen represented, and the <HI>Parliament</HI> receiv'd full Satisfaction, that all the Diligence was used which the Nature of the Thing would admit,—<HI>But be that as it will,</HI> by the Event we found that <HI>Providence</HI> blessed the Measures taken, so as that they not only prevented the Execution of the Design at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> but dispirited the Party in such a Manner, that they durst not make the Attempt any where else, which they might have done with too much Effect, and might but too well have made themselves Amends for the Disappointment, by ruining the Country, and keeping the Affairs of <HI>Britain</HI> in longer Suspence.</P>
<P>I shall however, without meddling with these Disputes which are dead with the Thing, show by the meer Relation of Fact, That <HI>England</HI> was in no
<PB N="iv" REF="5"/>
Condition to have made any Preparation that could have been effectual to prevent the Landing of the French;—And thus all they had done, as to Stores, Magazines, or Arms, as the Thing then stood, had been only leaving the greater Booty to the Enemy, and furnishing them with Weapons to use against our selves,—Since the Number of Troops, or the Condi∣tion of the Fortifications of <HI>Scotland</HI> were such as could make no tolerable Resistance, nor so much as protect the Magazines, if any had been E∣rected.</P>
<P>But to return to the Preparations made in <HI>England:</HI>—<HI>First,</HI> with <HI>Incredible Celerity,</HI> all the Men of War that could be found in any Con∣dition were fitted out, mann'd, and victualled in Order to put to Sea, and wait for the Enemies Fleet;—And the Expedition in this Case was so surprising, That the <HI>French</HI> who had been inform'd that the <HI>English</HI> Navy was in no Condition to offer them any Disturbance in their Design, and upon which Presumption, they own'd afterward they made their Design publick; found to their Disappointment sixteen <HI>English</HI> Men of War cruising before <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> before they (the <HI>French</HI>) were in any Condition to put to Sea—This however did not put a Stop to their Design,—but they went on with their Equipment; And their Fleet being ready, they embark'd their Troops about the fifth of <HI>March,</HI> their whole Force consisting of <HI>Twenty eight Sail</HI> of <HI>Ships,</HI> whereof sixteen were <HI>Men of War,</HI> and twelve were large <HI>Friggots</HI> or <HI>Privateers;</HI>—Their <HI>Land-Forces</HI> consisted of 15<HI> French Battalions,</HI> and about 300<HI> Volunteers,</HI> the most part <HI>Irish,</HI> being to serve as <HI>Officers</HI> for the raising <HI>New Regiments</HI> in <HI>Scotland;</HI>—These Forces being on Board with the <HI>Pretender,</HI> and some few <HI>Scots</HI> Gentlemen, particularly, the two Sons of the <HI>Earl</HI> of <HI>Middletoun,</HI> with the Old Lord <HI>Griffin, &amp;c.</HI> They came out of <HI>Dunkirk</HI> about the sixth of <HI>March,</HI> commanded by the <HI>French</HI> Admiral <HI>Monsieur Fourbin.</HI></P>
<P>In this Time the Diligence of our <HI>Admiralty</HI> was such, tho <HI>England</HI> was at that Time very bare of Ships, that the <HI>English Squadron</HI> before <HI>Dunkirk</HI> was made up to 36 Sail, including some <HI>Dutch Men of War,</HI> that had also joined them; And as the <HI>French</HI> Fleet lay in <HI>Newport Pits,</HI> watching an Opportunity to sail, so the <HI>English</HI> lay off of <HI>Graveline,</HI> ready to start with them, and resolv'd, <HI>if possible,</HI> to engage them in their <HI>Passage.</HI></P>
<P>However, The <HI>French</HI> trusting to their <HI>Canvas;</HI> the Cleanness of their <HI>Bottoms,</HI> and their <HI>Nimble Sailing,</HI> resolved to put to Sea; tho, <HI>as it were,</HI> in Ʋiew of a superior Force: And accordingly, the Wind blowing fresh at <HI>North-west,</HI> they weighed and set Sail;—The various Course of the Fleets, and the Success, as to the sailing part, was the Sub∣ject of much Discourse: I shall therefore be the Exacter in it, since it was wondred very much, how the <HI>French</HI> who lay in View of the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> Fleet could so get the Start of them, as to be at the <HI>Firth</HI> of <HI>Edin∣burgh</HI> about two Days before them; By which, had they not overshot their Port, they might have fairly put their Design in Execution, not∣withstanding all the Power of the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet at their Heels.</P>
<P>The Wind, as I noted before, blew at <HI>North-west,</HI> a fresh Gale, and the <HI>French</HI> weighing upon the Top of High Water, went away with the
<PB N="v" REF="6"/>
Tide of Ebb to the <HI>North-</HI> ward, keeping the <HI>Dutch</HI> Coast on Board, which was then the Weather-Shore.</P>
<P>The <HI>English</HI> lying in <HI>Gravling-Pits,</HI> had the following Disadvantages in the Pursuit; <HI>First,</HI> That it was about <HI>Eight Hours</HI> after the <HI>French</HI> were sailed, before they could get Notice of it, and be under Sail.</P>
<P>It was indeed wondred at by some, why the <HI>English</HI> Fleet knowing very well that the <HI>French</HI> were designed for <HI>Scotland,</HI> which was <HI>North:</HI> and that they lay in <HI>Newport</HI> Road, should <HI>themselves</HI> ly in <HI>Graveling,</HI> which was at least 25 Miles to the <HI>South;</HI>—By which Means, when ever the French should sail, they would necessarily be-behind them a considerable Way.</P>
<P>But this is Answered by the Sailers, and which I shall not un∣dertake to confute, <HI>viz.</HI> that it blew very hard, the Wind at <HI>North,</HI> and <HI>North</HI>-west: And there was no other Place where the <HI>English</HI> Fleet could ride with Safety:</P>
<P>I shall leave this Dispute as I find it, and content my self with only naming it, as I shall others that came after it.—</P>
<P>Be it as it will, the Matter of Fact was so;—The <HI>French</HI> Fleet being sailed about Eight Hours before,—Advice was brought to Sir <HI>George Bing,</HI> who weigh'd with all Expedition, and followed with all the Sail he could make.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>George</HI> had also another Disadvantage, <HI>viz.</HI> That the <HI>French</HI> sailing with the first of the Ebb, he lost a Tide of them—So that in their first Starting, the <HI>French</HI> had the Advantage of the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> Fleet, as follows.—<LIST>
<ITEM>Eight Hours in Time,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Twenty five Miles in Space,</ITEM>
<ITEM>And the Ebb of the Tide.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>With these Helps, and having first left out the lower Tire of their Guns to make them Light for sailing, their Ships being clean, and new fitted, the <HI>French</HI> Ships also being really better Sailers, generally speaking, than ours: with these Helps, I say, they got a very great Start of the <HI>English</HI> in their first setting out.</P>
<P>When they came to Sea, another Thing happened, which gave them ae yet farther Advantage of the <HI>English;</HI>—The <HI>French</HI> Fleet kept a large <HI>Offing,</HI> as they call it, keeping to <HI>Windward</HI> all the Way rather nearer the <HI>German</HI> Coast than the <HI>British.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>English</HI> Fleet bore away for their own Coast, and were seen off of <HI>Loestof</HI> and <HI>Yarmouth,</HI> and from the Shore of <HI>Norfolk.</HI></P>
<P>The Reasons for this different shaping their Course seem these;—The <HI>French</HI> were by all means possible to avoid the <HI>English</HI> Shore, lest they should be taken short by the Wind, and might be Embay'd, and con∣sequently Overtaken, having a Superior Force behind them. Also it was not fit for them to be seen before they came to the <HI>Firth,</HI> that they might not give the <HI>Alarm</HI> to the <HI>English</HI> to be ready for them.</P>
<P>On the other Hand, the <HI>English</HI> made their own Coast, lest the <HI>French</HI> should fallin there with their <HI>Merchants,</HI> and sweep the Coast of their Ships: Which had they done, they might indeed have made great <HI>Havock.</HI></P>
<P>However it was, these Disadvantages gave the <HI>French</HI> such a Start of
<PB N="vi" REF="7"/>
the <HI>English,</HI> that they were on the Coast of <HI>Scotland</HI> two Days before the <HI>English</HI> Fleet, and had not <HI>Heaven</HI> blinded their <HI>Pilots,</HI> so as to miss their Port, they might have put their Design in Execution in Spight of all our Forces.</P>
<P>On <HI>Friday March</HI> the 12<HI>th,</HI> they made the Coast of <HI>Scotland,</HI> but found themselves the Hight of <HI>Montross,</HI> about fifteen Leagues to the North of the <HI>Mouth</HI> of the <HI>Firth</HI> of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI>—Here they made Signals, and some Boats going off to them, they were Informed where they were,—then they stood away Southward, and spent all that Day before they got to the <HI>Mouth</HI> of the <HI>Firth.</HI></P>
<P>Now they sent one Ship, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Salisbury,</HI> up the <HI>Firth,</HI> whether it was to make any Signal to their Party, to give Notice of their Coming, Or to get any Intelligence, remains yet Undetermined;—they made the <HI>Firth</HI> just as the Tide was spent, and were therefore Obliged to spend six Hours more at Anchor, under the Isle of <HI>Maii</HI> in the <HI>Mouth</HI> of the <HI>Firth,</HI> and here, on the fourteenth early in the Morning, they find themselves Overtaken, their <HI>Scouts</HI> Discovering the <HI>English Fleet</HI> standing in for the <HI>Mouth</HI> of the <HI>Firth.</HI></P>
<P>Here then, they find their <HI>Enterprise</HI> at an End, their Moments are gone, in which they might have put their Errand in Execution,—and now they have no more to do, but to make the best of their Way to Sea.</P>
<P>Upon this, therefore they Weigh, and stand away for the <HI>North,</HI> with all the Sail they can make, and the <HI>English Fleet</HI> after them.</P>
<P>The Foremost of the <HI>English</HI> Ships came often within Gunshot of them, but not so many as could stop their <HI>Fleet,</HI> or bring them to Engage,—but they maintained a Kind of a Runing <HI>Fight</HI> with those of the <HI>English</HI> that Pursued, in which little Harm was done on either Side, save that in the Night, one of their Ships being the <HI>Salisbury,</HI> formerly taken from the <HI>English,</HI> fell in among the <HI>English Fleet,</HI> and being Surrounded was Taken.</P>
<P>With this Booty, and the <HI>French</HI> Out-sailing the <HI>English,</HI> Sir <HI>George Bing</HI> having Pursued them to the North-east Point of <HI>Scot∣land,</HI> Called <HI>Buchan-ness,</HI> seen them several Leagues to the North of that, and at last lost Sight of them, he returned to the <HI>Firth</HI> of <HI>Edin∣burgh;</HI> And keeping his <HI>Fleet</HI> in a Sailing Posture, with his <HI>Scouts</HI> continually Abroad to gain Intelligence of the <HI>Enemy,</HI> he continued in the <HI>Firth</HI> till the Begining of <HI>April;</HI> When the Government having Intelligence that the <HI>French</HI> were Returned into <HI>Dunkirk</HI> with their <HI>Fleet,</HI> Sir <HI>George Bing</HI> was also Ordered Southward with the <HI>English Fleet,</HI> and so the whole War on that Side ended.</P>
<P>I come now to speak a little of the <HI>Preparations</HI> made by the <HI>Eng∣lish,</HI> by Land, in Order to Meet this New Eruption; supposing the <HI>French</HI> had Landed,—which indeed was not without Hazard.</P>
<P>In Order to this, such Troops as were at Hand, were immediately Ordered to March Northward, particularly they sent away two Troops of the Queens Horse Guards, the Duke of <HI>Northumberland's</HI> Regi∣ment of Horse, with the three Regiments of Dragoons of <HI>Essex, Raby</HI> and <HI>Carpenter;</HI> besides which, two Regiments of Dragoons, and one
<PB N="vii" REF="8"/>
Regiment of Horse were Ordered to March to the North of <HI>Ireland,</HI> to ly ready there, to be Embark'd on the first Orders.</P>
<P>Of Foot there were Thirteen Battalions then in <HI>England</HI> sent for∣wards, including the Queens Guards, and some new Raised not quite Compleat, and Ten Battalions from <HI>Holland.</HI></P>
<P>It is to be Noted, That as soon as ever the Certainty of the Design∣ed <HI>Invasion</HI> came to the Knowledge of the <HI>States,</HI> they Ordered Transports immediately to Carry Ten Battalions of <HI>British</HI> Troops to <HI>England,</HI> to Assist the Queens Troops there; and when Sir <HI>George Bing</HI> Pursued the <HI>French Fleet,</HI> as above, he sent <HI>Admiral Baker,</HI> with Twelve Men of War into <HI>Holland,</HI> to bring those Troops away to <HI>New Castle</HI> upon <HI>Tyne,</HI> that so being Landed there, they might be ready to joyn the Land Army, and the Ships to joyn the Fleet.</P>
<P>The Forces being thus Appointed, Marched all Northward, but the Rendezvous was Appointed at <HI>York;</HI> For the Generals knowing the Troops in <HI>Scotland</HI> to be Weak, and not assured how the People there would behave themselves in general, had Resolved not to March any Troops into <HI>Scotland,</HI> till the whole Army was Assembled, that they might March in a Body—and to this Purpose the Earl of <HI>Leven,</HI> with these few Forces he had in <HI>Scotland,</HI> was Ordered, if he could not Prevent their Landing, to make his Retreat to <HI>Berwick.</HI></P>
<P>The Forces when all together, would have Amounted by Computati∣on as follows, <TABLE>

<P>Beside which, the <HI>Dutch</HI> had prepared a Second Convoy to send Over Twelve Battalions more, if there had been any Occasion.</P>
<P>A Train of <HI>Artillery</HI> was preparing at the <HI>Tower</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> and was in a Good Forwardness, so as it might probably have been at the Rendezvous as soon as the Troops could have well been Drawn toge∣ther.</P>
<P>I have been the more Particular in this, because I am Drawing every thing to the <HI>Reader's</HI> View, that he may judge of some Con∣jectures, I shall make concerning the Probabilities of the Success of this <HI>Enterprise,</HI> and what might reasonably be supposed to have been the Issue of it, since some People have been so Weak, as to say, It had been Better for us to have let them come on <HI>Shore,</HI> and that we should immediately have Crusht and Defeated them.</P>
<P>It remains now, to Enquire how the People of <HI>Scotland</HI> behaved themselves in this Critical Juncture, and what Condition they were in there, to have Received the <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P>As to the Condition of <HI>Scotland</HI> at that Time; it is to be Confest, the French had all the Encouragement imaginable, to make such an Attempt from the Circumstances of the Place, and the Temper of the People: As to the Circumstances of the Place, 'tis Evident that the Country was intirely Naked, and in a manner Defenceless.</P>

It must be Confest, <HI>Never was Nation in such a Condition to be Invaded;</HI> And there is no Doubt, but had the <HI>French</HI> Landed their <HI>Forces,</HI> and got their Stores of <HI>Arms</HI> and <HI>Ammunition</HI> on <HI>Shore,</HI> as <HI>they might easily have done, if they had not Overshot their Port</HI>—They would with very little Opposition have been <HI>Masters</HI> of the whole <HI>Country.</HI></P>
<P>It may be thought by some remote to my Purpose to Demon∣strate this; But when I consider, what Differing Notions the People in <HI>England</HI> have of the Attempt of the <HI>French,</HI> and of their Success in it; I can not think it an Useless La∣bour to give you a Brief Essay, at what the Event of that Enterprize might probably have been,—that so we may see what we have to be thankful for.</P>
<P>I am now to suppose the <HI>French</HI> Safe on Shore, their Magazine and Train of Artillery Landed, and the Earl of <HI>Leven</HI> the <HI>General for Her Majesty,</HI> Retreating towards <HI>Berwick,</HI> as he must undoubt∣edly have done,—and <HI>as his Orders directed him to do</HI>—, without which his Retreat being Cut off, he must have been Surrounded and Taken, or have been Cut in Pieces, having no Place of Strength to Retreat to.</P>
<P>Had they been thus on <HI>Shore,</HI> there is no Doubt, but in two Hours they had been Masters of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> an open City, and without De∣fence; the <HI>Castle</HI> indeed might have Held Out some Time, but the <HI>City</HI> could have made no Resistance.—But that which was worse, the Circumstances of the Time was such, and the People were so Di∣vided, that the <HI>City</HI> must have sent down to <HI>Leith</HI> to have sought Protection from the <HI>French</HI> against their own Rabbles, and they must have Desired the <HI>French</HI> to have Come and Taken them into their Protection, to have Preserved them from Plunder and Confusion.</P>
<P>I think <HI>whatever the Reasons of this were,</HI> which I desire to bury in Silence, the Fact will be readily granted; and indeed all Men owned at that Time, that if the <HI>French</HI> Landed their Forces, they must be Master of the City of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> without any Opposition.</P>
<P>It is true that I am now but upon Suggestion and meer Supposition, and I do not Affirm positively; But I leave it to any Man to judge of Probabilities, and whether what I Suggest is Rational or no;—When the <HI>French</HI> were thus Possest of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> it is very reasonable to Imagine that the first Thing they would have done, was to <HI>Proclaim</HI> their <HI>King:</HI> If the Magistrates of the <HI>City</HI> would not have Agreed to have Performed the <HI>Ceremony,</HI> the <HI>Tolbooth</HI> was near at Hand, and the <HI>Citizens</HI> being Assembled, could soon have Chosen New <HI>Magistrates,</HI> who would Chearfully have done it—.</P>
<P>Their King being Proclaimed, it seems Rational to Suppose, they should next Summon the <HI>Inhabitants</HI> to take an <HI>Oath</HI> of <HI>Fidelity</HI> to him; Such as Refused would have their <HI>Estates Confiscated,</HI> and perhaps be Imprisoned; and if they got Room to Flee, would have their Houses Plundred.</P>
<P><PB N="x" REF="11"/>
Being thus Masters of the <HI>Capital,</HI> and the <HI>Queens</HI> Troops having Fled or Retreated towards <HI>Berwick,</HI> the Country exposed to their Power; I think I make no Trespass on good Manners or Justice, if I say, The Northern <HI>High-landers</HI> would have been soon Raised by the Influence of their <HI>Superiors,</HI> who are for the most part <HI>Jacobites,</HI>—These being in Arms, the <HI>Low-Lands</HI> are at their Mercy, and they had soon Possest themselves of the whole <HI>Country,</HI> the <HI>Militia</HI> being entirely without a <HI>Head,</HI> and without Order, Unlockt from the former Settlement; and Unfixt in a New.</P>
<P>Being thus Possest of the <HI>Low-Lands,</HI> they soon would have been <HI>Master</HI> of the whole <HI>Country;</HI> and indeed there was very Few that Durst show their Faces against them, the Forwardness of One Party, and the Divisions and Disorders of the Other making Way for it,—when they had thus Reduc'd the <HI>Low-Lands,</HI> they had no more to do, than to call a <HI>Convention</HI> of <HI>Estates,</HI> as at the <HI>Revolution;</HI> and finding these Fast to their <HI>Interest;</HI> The first <HI>Laws</HI> should be to Re∣scind the <HI>Revolution,</HI> Declare the <HI>Limited Succession</HI> a <HI>Visible Re∣bellion,</HI> and an <HI>Invasion</HI> of the <HI>Right</HI> of another—, and thus a compleat National Turn should have pass'd upon us—, and the <HI>Revo∣lution</HI> should suffer a <HI>Re-revolution</HI> in a few Weeks, <HI>for these things would require but little Time:</HI> Neither is it Presumption to Sup∣pose, they should have gotten a <HI>Representative</HI> returned, that would have come into such Measures, since they having the Absolute Posses∣sion of the <HI>Country,</HI> the Influencing them under such Circumstances, to the Choosing such Persons as they should think fit to put upon them was easie enough,—Instances of which have been but too Common in this <HI>Island,</HI> under a less Tyrannical Power than a <HI>French</HI> Army.</P>
<P>While they were thus Settling their <HI>Civil Government</HI>—, Their <HI>Military Affairs</HI> could not have failed; the Inclination of the Common People about <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and the Influence of the <HI>Chiefs</HI> and <HI>Heads</HI> of <HI>Clans</HI> in the <HI>High-Lands,</HI> would have soon furnished Men for New <HI>Revolutions,</HI>—The <HI>sixteen</HI> Regiments which they brought with them, (so it seems they had determined) should have had <HI>two hundred</HI> Men added to every Regiment, by way of filling up—five Regi∣ments of <HI>Dragoons,</HI> and <HI>fourty</HI> Battalions of <HI>Foot</HI> was to have been Raised immediately—; The Command of these Troops was to be gi∣ven to <HI>Irish</HI> Officers, and of such, they brought great Numbers with them; save only that the <HI>Colonels</HI> and some <HI>Captains,</HI> were to be Cho∣sen of the <HI>Superiors</HI> or <HI>Chiefs</HI> where they were Raised, to Encourage the Raising them.</P>
<P>Thus in less than six Weeks, they should have had 30000 Men added to the Troops they brought with them—; The Money they would have given the <HI>High-Land Gentlemen,</HI> would Effectual∣ly have brought these <HI>Gentlemen</HI> to Forsake their Party, and Joyn with them, and then the Design would have gone on beyond Expectation.</P>
<P>We are next to Enquire what was to become of the <HI>English</HI> Prepa∣ration all this while? You have heard what <HI>Strength</HI> they were of when come together; But it could not be possible that they could be all brought together, their <HI>Magazines</HI> furnished, <HI>For the</HI> French <HI>would have taken Care, they should have Subsisted ill enough in</HI> Scotland, <HI>Their</HI> <PB N="xi" REF="12"/> Train of <HI>Artillery</HI> have been come up, and they in Condition to have Marched into <HI>Scotland</HI> in Battalia, as they must have done, under six Weeks or two Months—; the Difficulties of the Roads, <HI>the Country being at that Time very Deep,</HI> and the Carriages Heavy, would have made it very bad, Marching an <HI>Army</HI>—; and the Want of <HI>For∣rage</HI> would have made it Impracticable to have done it sooner.</P>
<P>All this Time the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Jacobites</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> would have had, to have Strengthned their <HI>New Settlement,</HI> form'd their <HI>Army,</HI> Fortified <HI>Leith,</HI> and other Places, and have prepared for War.</P>
<P>I shall readily Grant as any Body can desire, That when the <HI>Eng∣lish Army</HI> came to be ready, and to enter <HI>Scotland,</HI> they should Beat these <HI>New Invaders</HI> out of all; and that they should in Time pay Dear for the Attempt; But it must be granted, this would have these Consequences withal, 1<HI>.</HI> That it would have Ruin'd <HI>Scotland.</HI> 2. Brought the <HI>Seat</HI> of <HI>War</HI> home to our own Doors. 3<HI>.</HI> Cause a Di∣version of our <HI>Forces,</HI> and be an Occasion of withdrawing our <HI>Troops</HI> from <HI>Flanders,</HI> where the <HI>Enemy</HI> felt the greatest Weight of the <HI>War</HI>—. And 4<HI>.</HI> Have exceedingly protracted the <HI>War:</HI> Those <HI>Gentlemen</HI> that were for having them Land, may Consult these probable Conse∣quences, and they will see whether they have not very good Reason to be sensible of the <HI>Happiness</HI> of the Disappointment.</P>
<P>I can not but take Notice here, of the <HI>Temper</HI> of the <HI>People</HI> of <HI>Scotland</HI> at this Time; none will Doubt, but the Minds of Men were variously agitated as their several <HI>Tempers, Interest</HI> and <HI>Party</HI> guid∣ed them—, <HI>Hope</HI> on one Side, and <HI>Fear</HI> on the other Discovered it self in a manner which both Sides would fain have Concealed, nor was there wanting a <HI>Party</HI> who openly and avowedly, profest their Desires to have the <HI>French</HI> Land, and their <HI>Resolution</HI> to joyn with them, and this in so Open, so Rude, and so Threatning a Manner, as gave just Cause of <HI>Terror</HI> to the Honest Loyal <HI>Party</HI> on the other Hand, who saw themselves inevitably Ruin'd, <HI>if the</HI> French <HI>Landed,</HI> by their own Rabbles—, The other <HI>Party</HI> having openly Threatned and Mark'd out the <HI>Houses</HI> of such <HI>Families</HI> as were most Eminent for their <HI>Zeal</HI> to the Establish't <HI>Government.</HI></P>
<P>It was Expected, and indeed Apprehended very much in <HI>England,</HI> that those of the <HI>Presbyterians,</HI> who had before Vigorously Appeared against the <HI>Union,</HI> and profest their Dislike of it upon all Occasions, would have Appeared against the <HI>Government,</HI> at this Juncture, and either have joyn'd with the <HI>Invaders,</HI> or have formed a Third <HI>Party,</HI> and so have made a Division, which had in its Kind been equal∣ly Fatal.</P>
<P>But in this also they were disappointed, for the People who were most warm against the <HI>Union,</HI> nay even the <HI>Western Men</HI> who do not own or join with the <HI>Church,</HI> yet all as one Man declared against joining with <HI>French Invaders, Papists,</HI> and a <HI>Returning Tyranny,</HI> which they easi∣ly foresaw must be the Consequence of an <HI>Invasion;</HI> And therefore lay∣ing aside all their Old Animosities, private Grudges, and Cavils at the <HI>Union, &amp;c.</HI> They unanimously declared their Resolution to stand toge∣ther,
<PB N="xii" REF="13"/>
and with their Lives and Estates to defend the <HI>Government</HI> and their <HI>Country</HI> against all the <HI>Powers</HI> of <HI>France</HI> and the <HI>Pretender;</HI> And to this End, they began to form Associations, the Burghers of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> listed Men, and subscribed, for their Maintenance, some 10, some 20, some more, and in other Places they were apreparing to do the like;—the <HI>Western Men</HI> sent them Word they would come and join with them, <HI>if there was Occasion;</HI> And in the mean time some of the People called <HI>Cameronians</HI> made their open Protestation against it.</P>
<P>This was a very great Encouragment to the <HI>Government</HI> at that Time, when the Vaunts of the other Party run high, and their Hopes were great; But <HI>GOD</HI> in his <HI>Providence</HI> prevented the evil Consequences of this Affair, as you have heard: and the good People who had made great Ap∣pearances of <HI>Unanimity,</HI> found themselves delivered another and an easier Way.</P>
<P>It happened very well at this Time, That the <HI>Commission</HI> of the <HI>General Assembly</HI> was just set down, and the <HI>Ministers</HI> seeing the <HI>Storm</HI> coming, both on the <HI>Ecclesiastick,</HI> as well as <HI>Civil Liberties</HI> of the <HI>Nation, Religion</HI> and <HI>Property</HI> being visibly struck at together in the <HI>Flood</HI> of <HI>Foreign Destruction,</HI> plainly Threatning to swallow up both—appointed a <HI>Solemn Fast</HI> to be kept over the whole Coun∣try.</P>
<P>I shall make no <HI>Comments</HI> on the Subject Matter of this <HI>Fast,</HI> the <HI>Act</HI> of the <HI>Commission</HI> does sufficiently show the Sense of the <HI>Mini∣sters,</HI> and in what Manner the <HI>Invasion</HI> was like to relish among them; and therefore I have Inserted it in this Place, to Record the <HI>Temper</HI> that appear'd at that Time; and what Hope the <HI>Pretender,</HI> or his <HI>Party</HI> had Ground to raise upon the supposed <HI>Divisions</HI> of the <HI>Presbyterians</HI> about the <HI>Union.</HI></P>

<P>THe <HI>Commission</HI> of the <HI>General Assembly,</HI> being sensible of the great Wickedness, and crying Sins of all Sorts, abounding a∣mongst us in this Church; and being in the just Judgment of GOD, Threatned with an <HI>Invasion</HI> by an Enemy, that hath Im∣ployed his Power for the Ruine of that Holy Religion which we Profess, and the Enslaving of <HI>Europe;</HI> and who designs to set a <HI>Popish Pretender</HI> upon the Throne of these Nations, to the utter Overthrow of the True Reformed Religion, all our Interests Sacred and Civil, and all that GOD hath graciously wrought for us by the late happy <HI>Revolution,</HI> and hitherto Preserved to us; and being Sensible of what we owe in Gratitude, to our only Rightful and Lawful SO∣VEREIGN QUEEN <HI>ANNE,</HI> do look upon it as our Duty, with a Regard to the Honour of GOD, the Preservation of our Religion, the Quiet of Her Majesties Government, and the Good of our Coun∣try,
<PB N="xiii" REF="14"/>
to Humble our selves before the LORD; and to call all Per∣sons in this National Church, to Humiliation, Fasting and Prayer, to turn to GOD in CHRIST our only Propitiation, and to Cry Mightily to Him, that for the Blood of his Son, he would forgive our Grievous Sins, give us a Sound and Understanding Heart, re∣move our Spiritual Plagues, and to Unite us to GOD, and to one another in him, that he would avert the deserved Wrath from these sinful Lands, in Disappointing the Designs of our Bloody and Cruel Enemies, defeat the threatned <HI>Invasion,</HI> maintain Peace and Truth amongst us, bless the Gospel with Success, by the Effusion of his Spirit, preserve Her Majesties Person, direct Her Councils, prosper Her Arms by Sea and Land, and bring these Wars to so happy an Issue, as may be for the Relief of our Oppressed Brethren abroad, and the Security of the <HI>Protestant Churches.</HI></P>
<P>And the said <HI>Commission</HI> hereby Appoints the first <HI>Thursday</HI> of <HI>April</HI> next, to be Religiously Observed in all the Congregations of this National Church, as a Day of Solemn Fasting, Humiliation and Prayer for the Causes above-mentioned; and Appoints the Ministers of this Church to make Intimation of the Premisses, publickly from their Pulpits upon the LORD's Day, immediately preceeding the foresaid Day of Humiliation, and to be more particular in specifying the Sins of these Lands, as they shall see Cause.</P>

<P>This <HI>Fast</HI> was Approv'd of by the <HI>Privy Council,</HI> and their Civil Sanction given thereto.</P>
<P>And the <HI>Queen</HI> in Her <HI>Letter</HI> to the <HI>General Assembly</HI> 1708, did shew Her Satisfaction with the <HI>Zeal</HI> and <HI>Affection</HI> the <HI>Ministers</HI> of this <HI>Church</HI> had shown at that Juncture.</P>
<P>The greatest Part of all the <HI>Presbyteries</HI> of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and <HI>Synods,</HI> Addressed the <HI>Queen</HI> also on the Subject of the <HI>Invasion;</HI> and the <HI>General Assembly</HI> declared their Sentiments thereof, 1<HI>st.</HI> In their <HI>Answer</HI> to the <HI>Queens Letter.</HI> 2<HI>ly.</HI> In their <HI>Address</HI> to <HI>Her Maje∣sty.</HI> And 3<HI>ly.</HI> In their <HI>National Thanksgiving</HI> inserted in their Printed <HI>Acts,</HI> pages 6, 8, 10, 12, 13.</P>
<P>Besides all this, many <HI>Parishes</HI> drew up <HI>Addresses</HI> to the <HI>Privy Council,</HI> shewing their <HI>Resolution</HI> to venture their <HI>Lives</HI> and <HI>For∣tunes</HI> in Defence of <HI>Her Majesties Person</HI> and <HI>Government;</HI> and Craving Leave to put themselves in a <HI>Posture</HI> of <HI>Defence;</HI> and in many Places the <HI>Presbyterians</HI> did Subscribe for considerable <HI>Sums,</HI> to be payed when called for, in order to buy <HI>Arms,</HI> and to maintain <HI>Men</HI> for the Ends foresaid: Some Burgers in <HI>Edinburgh</HI> Subscrib∣ed to Maintain 50<HI> Men,</HI> some 40<HI>,</HI> some 30<HI>,</HI> some 20<HI>,</HI> and some who were Poorer Subscribed for Fewer, and all this was done by the Advice, and with the Allowance of Persons Intrusted in the <HI>Govern∣ment</HI> by <HI>Her Majesty.</HI></P>
<P>But this is not all, the Seasonableness of this <HI>Solemn Fast</HI> was
<PB N="xiv" REF="15"/>
such, and so Serviceable to the <HI>Government,</HI> being brought out at the very Juncture of Time, when the <HI>Eyes</HI> both of <HI>Friends</HI> and <HI>Enemies</HI> were upon them, that it must be acknowledged, it shewed not only the <HI>Zeal</HI> of the <HI>Presbyterian Ministers</HI> for the <HI>Queen,</HI> the <HI>Government</HI> and their Establisht Interest; but it shewed their <HI>Wisdom</HI> and <HI>Pru∣dence</HI> in so happily timing an Action of that Determining Conse∣quence, and taking the very Moment of its being most Effectual, as well to Convince the <HI>Enemy,</HI> that they had nothing to expect that Way, but the whole United Force of the <HI>Presbyterians</HI> against them—To satisfy the <HI>Government</HI> and the <HI>English</HI> Nation, <HI>among whom Jealousies of the Contrary had been Industriously spread</HI>—, that the <HI>Presbyterains,</HI> one and all would Declare against the <HI>Invaders;</HI>—<HI>as also,</HI> to Settle and Determin such among themselves, <HI>if any such were,</HI> who might be otherwise unfix'd in their <HI>Resolutions,</HI> and doubtful what <HI>Course</HI> to take.</P>
<P>Nor was this all, but the <HI>Ministers</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> in their respective <HI>Parishes,</HI> upon the Occasion of the said <HI>Fast,</HI> applyed themselves to the Informing their <HI>People,</HI> what the real Views, and probable Con∣sequences of this <HI>Attempt</HI> were, what was Threatned to their <HI>Church,</HI> to their <HI>Establisht Religion,</HI> to their <HI>Liberties,</HI> to their <HI>Protestant Succession,</HI> and to the <HI>Revolution;</HI> How, whatever the specious Pre∣tences of Preserving the <HI>Establisht Church</HI> might be, <HI>Popery</HI> in Prin∣ciple, and <HI>Tyranny</HI> in Practice were certainly Incompatible with the <HI>Protestant Establishment</HI> of <HI>Scotland,</HI> which was Founded in <HI>Liberty,</HI> Depended upon <HI>Law,</HI> and could not Subsist, humanely speaking, but upon the supported Basis of <HI>Law</HI> and <HI>Liberty</HI> together; That the <HI>In∣vasion</HI> was a Visible Appearance of <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Popish Tyranny,</HI> the same that for <HI>twenty eight</HI> Years, bad Influenced the <HI>Councils</HI> and <HI>Governments</HI> of <HI>Scotland,</HI> while they Trampled on the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Scotland,</HI> Silenc'd their preaching <HI>Ministry,</HI> Persecuted and barba∣rously Murthered their <HI>Innocent Brethren,</HI> and bid Defiance to the <HI>Laws</HI> of <HI>GOD,</HI> and the <HI>Liberties</HI> of <HI>Scotland;</HI> that these <HI>Days</HI> would inevitably return upon them, and that all the <HI>Miseries</HI> they had for∣merly felt, were Effectually contain'd in the Womb of an <HI>Invasion.</HI></P>
<P>By this Method the <HI>Ministers</HI> opened-the <HI>Eyes</HI> of the whole <HI>Nation,</HI> and the <HI>People,</HI> Rous'd by this happy Vigour in their <HI>Clergy,</HI> began to Hir every where; Immediately a new Face appear'd upon the <HI>Publick Affairs,</HI> the General Dejection and Hesitation, which seemed before to make the <HI>People</HI> look Dark and Unresolved, was quite Removed, and nothing was to be seen among the <HI>Presbyterian Party</HI> of the <HI>People,</HI>—but <HI>Associations, Addresses, Preparations</HI> for Fighting, fitting up their <HI>Arms,</HI> and a Chearful resolved <HI>Temper</HI> of <HI>Fighting</HI> the <HI>French</HI> where-ever they were to be found.</P>
<P>Some of the <HI>Ministers</HI> themselves were so Vigorous in this, that they Caused their whole <HI>Parishes</HI> to Associate and Bind themselves, One to another, and all together to the <HI>Government,</HI> to stand as one Man against the <HI>Invaders.</HI></P>
<P>The Service this did the <HI>Government,</HI> the Encouragement it gave
<PB N="xv" REF="16"/>
in <HI>England,</HI> and the Discouragement it gave to the <HI>Jacobite Party</HI> at that Juncture, was such, as the last especially will not easily forget;—and I thought it very Useful to Transmit the <HI>Memory</HI> of it thus to <HI>Posterity,</HI> that they may know how their <HI>Ancestors</HI> Acted in this <HI>Great Affair;</HI> and how they ought to Act on the like Occasions.</P>
<P>In this Posture the Affairs of this <HI>Island</HI> stood, when the <HI>French baf∣fled by the immediate Hand of GOD's Providence, in missing their Port,</HI> were pursued by the <HI>English</HI> Fleet, and made their Escape <HI>by the Goodness of their Sails</HI> to <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> where their <HI>Troops</HI> were put on Shore, <HI>and so the Expedition ended.</HI></P>
<P>The ten <HI>Battalions</HI> which came from <HI>Holland</HI> to <HI>New-Castle</HI> were not at all landed, but went immediately back, and were in the Field again Time enough to show themselves in the <HI>First of the Campaign</HI>—The <HI>English Troops</HI> march'd back without entring into <HI>Scotland;</HI> The Prisoners taken on Board the <HI>Salisbury</HI> were brought to <HI>Hull,</HI> and treated as <HI>Prisoners of War,</HI> in Order to be sent over to <HI>Holland</HI> for Exchange.</P>
<P>The Lord <HI>Griffin,</HI> with the two Sons of the Earl of <HI>Middletoun,</HI> and 15<HI> Irish reform'd Officers</HI> were carry'd to <HI>London;</HI> The three first were committed to the <HI>Tower,</HI> and the <HI>Irish</HI> to <HI>Newgate,</HI> being to be Tryed, <HI>as Traitors,</HI> against the <HI>QUEEN,</HI> whose natural born Subjects they appeared to be.</P>
<P>The Lord <HI>Griffin</HI> having been formerly attainted and outlaw'd, it need∣ed not that he should be brought to any Tryal: but, <HI>being carryed up to the QUEEN's Bench Bar</HI> he received <HI>Sentence of Death</HI> on the Foot of the said Outlawry, <HI>without any Tryal;</HI>—However, the <HI>Dauphin of France</HI> having wrot a particular Letter in his Behalf, <HI>to the Duke of Marlborcugh</HI> to intreat the <HI>QUEEN's Mercy to him,</HI> and that he <HI>(the Dauphin)</HI> made it his Request to the <HI>Queen, the Lord</HI> Griffin <HI>being his Servant;</HI>—The said Lord <HI>Griffin</HI> was reprived from Time to Time, and is yet living <HI>in the Tower,</HI> at the publishing these Sheets.</P>
<P>The <HI>Irish Officers</HI> also, and the Lord <HI>Middletoun's</HI> Sons remain yet <HI>Prisoners.</HI></P>
<P>On the other Hand, Great Heats and Disputes happened about the Gentlemen who were taken up upon Suspition.—</P>
<P>The Parliament, <HI>in the Heat of the Alarm,</HI> had passed a Bill suspen∣ding the <HI>Habeas Corpus Act</HI> for a Time, so far as should concern the Persons apprehended on this Account, and empowering the <HI>Queen</HI> to take up, and keep in Prison, such Persons as there should be Ground to suspect, were guilty of Confederating with, or Encouraging the <HI>In∣vaders.</HI></P>
<P>Had the Gentlemen concerned, been apprehended in anyother Juncture, they would perhaps have had no other Trouble than to have lyen still, and when the Thing had been over, have been released again, as was done at that Time in <HI>Ireland.</HI></P>
<P>But the Fury of our Divisions on either Hand run so high, that this could not be: Some thought the Persons taken up had more Hand in the <HI>Invasion</HI> than appeared, and that they ought not too lightly to be let go,
<PB N="xvi" REF="17"/>
left it might encourage both them and others to make the like Attempt a∣gain.</P>
<P>And these were very warm for Prosecutions, and for proposing Rewards to encourage Persons to come in to charge the <HI>Prisoners:</HI>—And would have all Manner of Methods tryed to fasten something upon them.</P>
<P>Others again <HI>Inveighed against the Ministry</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> as having partial and Party-Regards in the picking out <HI>such or such Persons</HI> to put in Prison, <HI>on Pretence of this Suspicion,</HI> as might gratifie the private Designs of particular Persons, either as to <HI>Private Picks</HI> and <HI>Personal Revenge,</HI> or to prejudice their Interests in Elections, <HI>there being a new Parliament then to be chosen.</HI></P>
<P>These Contentions, <HI>however grounded on either Side,</HI> had certainly this Effect, that they gave a great deal of Trouble to the <HI>Prisoners,</HI> which otherwise might have been avoided; For the <HI>Ministry</HI> seeing such pointing at probable Guilt on one Hand, and such Complaints of Injustice on the other, found it necessary to make the <HI>Proceedings more formal,</HI> and to have all the Gentlemen up to <HI>London,</HI>—That they might either be prosecuted, or let out upon <HI>Bail: as the Council should di∣rect.</HI></P>
<P>Ʋpon their coming up to <HI>London,</HI> they were all admitted to Bail, ex∣cept <HI>Four</HI> who were committed to Prison, and were after sent to <HI>Scot∣land</HI> to be Tryed; but these however were acquitted, <HI>the Lords of the Justiciary</HI> and <HI>Her Majesties Advocate</HI> differing upon some Forms; par∣ticularly, the Lords refusing to admit the <HI>Lord Advocate</HI> to produce more Witnesses—after the first Day of <HI>Tryal.</HI></P>
<P>It is not my Business to enter into this Dispute, <HI>otherwise I could be more large on this Head:</HI>—But the <HI>Government was so sen∣sible</HI> of the Inconveniencies of the old Method of prosecuting upon <HI>Trea∣son, from this Nicety,</HI> that presently upon this the <HI>Parliament</HI> resol∣ved to bring in a Bill to make the Laws for <HI>Tryals, in Cases of Treason,</HI> the same in <HI>Scotland</HI> as in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>From this Period is also to be dated the Distractions which followed in the Affair of Religion, <HI>and of which I think it is very material to speak,</HI> because they have made a great Noise in the World, <HI>and every one is not rightly apprised of the Thing</HI>—particularly many have enter∣tained Prejudices against the good People in <HI>Scotland,</HI> as if they had been acted by a <HI>Spirit of Passion and Persecution,</HI> when indeed, upon a full and clear Examination of the Matter of Fact, the contrary will evident∣ly appear; And therefore I could not satisfie my self without do∣ing this Piece of Justice to the Church and People of <HI>Scotland,</HI>—as to give an impartial Relation of the Fact, as it is attested out of the pub∣lick Registers, by the proper Officers: and being myself an Eye and Ear-Witness to every part of the <HI>Proceeding.</HI></P>
<P>About the End of <HI>February</HI> 1707/8, Her Majesty by Her Letter to the Privy Council in <HI>Scotland,</HI> gave Notice of the intended In∣vasion, back'd with a <HI>French</HI> Power, design'd against <HI>Scotland;</HI> recom∣mending to them the Security of the Kingdom, the Preservation of the Publick Peace, and that they would use all possible Means to that Effect.</P>
<P><PB N="xvii" REF="18"/>
The Privy Council taking this Affair into their Consideration, it natu∣rally occur'd; That to discourage the Enemies of the Government at Home, was <HI>among others,</HI> one of the best Steps to prevent the mischiev∣ous Consequences of an <HI>Invasion</HI> from Abroad; and in order to this, that it was reasonable to suppress the publick Meetings of those, who under pretence of Divine Worship, admitted such Ministers to officiate, as the Law in that Case had prohibited, having not qualifyed themselves by tak∣ing the Oaths, praying for the QƲEEN, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> by which the Publick Disaffection was upheld and encourag'd.</P>
<P>It was then agreed to <HI>Nemine Contradicente,</HI> in the Privy-Council; <HI>and for the Truth of which we refer our Reader to the Minutes of the Council for Proof;</HI> That Orders should be Issued out to all inferiour Magistrates, to put this Resolve in Execution; and Orders were accord∣ingly Issued out to the Magistrates of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> for that Purpose, who thereupon Legally called before them several Ministers or Preachers, who were known to keep Publick Meeting-Houses within their Bounds—Asking them plainly in Terms of Law, If they prayed for Her Majesty <HI>NOMINATIM,</HI> in their Publick Meeting-Houses; and if they had qua∣lifyed themselves by taking the <HI>Oath</HI> of <HI>Allegiance,</HI> and subscribing the same with the <HI>Assurance,</HI> as the Law requir'd?</P>
<P>Some of them answer'd directly, but others avoiding the Question, re∣quir'd a Legal Tryal, by way of Libel and Proof; which was accordingly Appointed, and whereof the precise Points were, their not taking the <HI>Oath</HI> of <HI>Allegiance,</HI> and subscribing the same with the <HI>Assurance;</HI> their not praying for Her Hajesty <HI>NOMINATIM,</HI> as the Law requires; and their not observing <HI>Publick Fasts</HI> and <HI>Thanksgivings;</HI> all which were Notour, and being <HI>Negatives</HI> proved themselves.</P>
<P>To this Libel the foresaid Preachers made Answers, and also took a Protest, That they were not legally cited, not being call'd either on fifteen Days as the old Law requires, or on ten Days, as the late Act of Parlia∣ment against <HI>Intruders</HI> prescribes.</P>
<P>To which it was Answered, That as to the fifteen Days, the known and perpetual Custom within Burgh had over-ruled it to <HI>twenty four</HI> Hours; and as to the ten Days, they were only appointed in the Tryal of <HI>Intruders.</HI> But the Preachers call'd, being conveen'd for notour Disaffection by not Praying, and by not taking the <HI>Oath</HI> of <HI>Allegiance,</HI> nor keeping <HI>Fasts</HI> and <HI>Thanksgivings,</HI> the <HI>Citations</HI> were good, and the <HI>Procedure</HI> un∣questionable; and yet the <HI>Magistrates</HI> thought fit to give them a farther <HI>Indulgence,</HI> and to allow them to give in all their <HI>Defences.</HI></P>
<P>The Sum of which <HI>Defences,</HI> as contain'd in a <HI>Representation</HI> exhibit by the said <HI>Preachers,</HI> being first the foresaid <HI>Dilators</HI> to this, they added, That by the <HI>Act</HI> of <HI>Parliament</HI> 1693, Requiring all <HI>Ministers</HI> and <HI>Preachers</HI> to take the <HI>Oath</HI> of <HI>Allegiance,</HI> It is provided, that the <HI>Contraveener</HI> shall be Punish'd by Banishment, or otherways as the <HI>Privy-Council</HI> should think fit, and therefore the <HI>Libel</HI> was improperly tabled before the <HI>Magistrates.</HI></P>
<P>It was Answer'd, To the <HI>first Dilators,</HI> that the former <HI>Answers</HI> were repeated; And to the <HI>second,</HI> That the <HI>Privy-Council</HI> having
<PB N="xviii" REF="19"/>
refer'd the Execution to the <HI>Magistrates,</HI> there could be no more <HI>De∣bate</HI> about their <HI>Competency</HI> on that <HI>Head.</HI></P>
<P>But then they went on to Object against the Relevancy. And as to the <HI>Act</HI> of the <HI>Convenion,</HI> Ordaining all <HI>Ministers</HI> to Pray for the KING and QUEEN <HI>Nominatim,</HI> They Answer'd, That that <HI>Act</HI> did die and expire with King <HI>WILLIAM</HI> and Queen <HI>MARY.</HI> And as to the <HI>Act</HI> 1693, Ordaining all <HI>Preachers</HI> to take the <HI>Oath</HI> of <HI>Allegiance,</HI> and Sign the same with the <HI>Assurance;</HI> They Answer'd, <HI>First,</HI> That that <HI>Act</HI> did only concern <HI>Ministers</HI> provided to Benefices and Stipends; and could not be extended to such <HI>Preachers,</HI> as enjoy no Benefice under the <HI>Government;</HI> And <HI>Secondly,</HI> The <HI>Act</HI> Recog∣nizing Her Majesty Queen <HI>ANNE,</HI> enjoyns the Taking of the <HI>Oath</HI> of <HI>Allegiance,</HI> &amp;c. to such as are in publick Trust, and <HI>Preachers</HI> not benefic'd cannot be said to be in any publick Trust; And <HI>Thirdly,</HI> The <HI>Act</HI> of <HI>Parliament</HI> 1693, limited to the Persons of King <HI>WILLI∣AM</HI> and Queen <HI>MARY,</HI> is out of Doors with them.</P>
<P>To which it was Reply'd, That the <HI>Act</HI> of <HI>Convention,</HI> Ordaining all <HI>Ministers</HI> and <HI>Preachers</HI> to Pray for the KING and QUEEN <HI>No∣minatim,</HI> is certainly to be understood likeways, of all their Royal Suc∣cessors, specially since it is so plainly founded upon the Command of the <HI>Apostle,</HI> and the Duties of all <HI>Subjects. Secondly,</HI> The <HI>Act</HI> 1693, expresly relates to all <HI>Preachers,</HI> whether Benefic'd or not, and withal defines all <HI>Preachers</HI> to be Persons in publick Trust; so that the <HI>Act</HI> recognizing Her Majesty did exactly fall within it, and affords no Relief to the <HI>Defenders.</HI> And <HI>Thirdly,</HI> The <HI>Act</HI> 1693, tho' it men∣tion King <HI>WILLIAM</HI> and Queen <HI>MARY,</HI> yet is not limited to them, but being a perpetual Law, extends to all their Royal <HI>Successors;</HI> Likeas by the said <HI>Act</HI> recognizing Her Majesty, it is <HI>de facto</HI> so ex∣tended.</P>
<P>Which <HI>Defences</HI> and <HI>Replies</HI> being Read and Considered by the <HI>Magistrates,</HI> they repell'd the <HI>Dilators,</HI> as also all the other <HI>Defences</HI> proponed for the <HI>Defenders,</HI> and found, that since they had not Pray'd for Her Majesty Queen <HI>ANNE, Nominatim,</HI> and taken the <HI>Oath</HI> of <HI>Allegiance, &amp;c.</HI> they had incur'd the Pains of Law, and therefore Ordain'd them, and every one of them, to desist from keeping of any Meeting-Houses within the City of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and Liberties thereof, and from Preaching or Exercising any Part of the <HI>Ministerial Functi∣on</HI> within the same in Time coming, under the Pain of Imprisonment, and to find Caution for that Effect betwixt and the 30<HI>th</HI> Day of <HI>March</HI> then instant, and in the mean Time that their <HI>Meeting-Houses,</HI> be forthwith shut up. But tho' this <HI>Sentence</HI> was then past, yet nothing follow'd upon it, until that the <HI>Privy-Council</HI> of <HI>Scotland</HI> being de∣termin'd by an <HI>Act</HI> of <HI>Parliament,</HI> after the 1st of <HI>May,</HI> these Dis∣affected <HI>People</HI> judging, that the <HI>Councils</HI> Orders were also ex∣pir'd with the <HI>Council</HI> that gave them, did about the 20<HI>th</HI> of <HI>June</HI> fall again to their <HI>Preaching,</HI> and enter'd their <HI>Meeting-Houses.</HI> And further they resolv'd among themselves, that they would continue to Preach and not Desist; which mov'd the <HI>Magistrates</HI> to renew the former <HI>Prohibition</HI> about the said 20<HI>th</HI> of <HI>June</HI> last, which they still
<PB N="xix" REF="20"/>
Neglecting and Despising, they were again call'd before the <HI>Magistrates</HI> about the 16<HI>th</HI> of <HI>July,</HI> and requir'd to find <HI>Caution</HI> or <HI>Bail</HI> to <HI>Desist,</HI> as being the known legal Execution upon such prohibitory Sentences, or otherways to go to <HI>Prison.</HI> But they still refusing to obey, the <HI>Magistrates</HI> thought fit on the 13<HI>th</HI> to send Five only to <HI>Prison,</HI> which Five were also at length reliev'd; so indulgent were the <HI>Magistrates</HI> in this Matter.</P>
<P>This whole <HI>Trial,</HI> and all the Steps thereof, being transmitted to <HI>Her Majesty,</HI> it pleased <HI>Her Majesty</HI> by Her Royal Letters under Her Hand and Seal of the 18<HI>th</HI> of <HI>September</HI> last, to approve what was done by the <HI>Magistrates</HI> of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> in the said Matter, as ac∣ceptable Service; and further to judge it necessary for the Safety of Her <HI>Royal Person</HI> and <HI>Government,</HI> that all such <HI>Meeting-Houses</HI> in every other Place should be shut up.</P>
<P><HI>Thus far the Matter of Fact.</HI></P>
<P>It is most true, that in this first <HI>Prosecution,</HI> there was no other or further <HI>Design,</HI> than the giving a <HI>Check</HI> to the <HI>Invasion,</HI> and to the <HI>Insolence</HI> of some of the <HI>non jurant Party,</HI> who at that Time began to be more formidable in <HI>Scotland</HI> than in <HI>England;</HI> and this is apparent in the Lenity and Forbearance of the <HI>Magistrates</HI> and <HI>Justices</HI> of the <HI>Peace</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> who as soon as the <HI>Invasion</HI> was over, and the <HI>Danger</HI> from abroad seem'd at an <HI>End,</HI> were very easy with them again, the <HI>Ministers</HI> who had been Confined were silently let go, and their former <HI>Liberty</HI> conniv'd at again; so that their <HI>Meetings</HI> became as frequent as they were before, notwithstanding they still re∣fused to take the <HI>Oaths,</HI> or Pray for the <HI>QUEEN.</HI></P>
<P>But here it began to appear, that there were some among those <HI>People,</HI> who had other <HI>Aims</HI> in these things, than meerly the <HI>Liberty</HI> of their <HI>Consciences,</HI> and the <HI>Worshiping GOD</HI>—; and that some∣thing ought to be attempted to make the <HI>People Uneasy,</HI> and to bring them by <HI>Force</HI> to Prosecute and Attack them.</P>
<P>And to this End, since refusing the <HI>Oaths,</HI> since refusing to Pray for the <HI>QUEEN,</HI> nay actually praying for the <HI>PRETENDER,</HI> would not provoke the <HI>Government,</HI> and <HI>Magistrates</HI> in <HI>Scotland</HI> to <HI>Persecute</HI>—; They find out another <HI>Expedient,</HI> which they are assured will not fail, being what they know the <HI>Scots</HI> will not bear, what ever it Cost them; and this was Erecting the <HI>Common Prayer</HI> or <HI>English Liturgy</HI> in <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>People</HI> that made this <HI>Attempt,</HI> behoved to get some Body to do it; that however <HI>Jacobite</HI> he might be in <HI>Principle,</HI> was yet La∣titudinarian enough in <HI>Conscience,</HI> that he could swallow all the <HI>Oaths</HI> which should be offered to him—; Indeed some of the <HI>Jacobite Clergy</HI> were so honest, that as they would not take the <HI>Oaths,</HI> so they did not approve of this <HI>Attempt,</HI> but openly Disavowed it—; Nor had the <HI>Episcopal People</HI> in <HI>Scotland</HI> ever set up the <HI>English Li∣turgy,</HI> altho they had Reign'd in <HI>Scotland</HI> for <HI>twenty eight</HI> Years to∣gether, before the <HI>Revolution.</HI></P>
<P>But the Design being concerted, they found a Tool; a <HI>poor Curate</HI> of 15 <HI>lib.</HI> a Year in <HI>Ireland,</HI> but born in <HI>Scotland,</HI> comes over to 
<PB N="xx" REF="21"/>
<HI>Edinburgh</HI> to mend his <HI>Commons;</HI> and having taken the <HI>Oaths,</HI> he falls in with this <HI>Party,</HI> who finding him a Person of prostituted <HI>Morals,</HI> a large Stock in the Face, and ready, if well paid, to do their Work, they promise him <HI>Fourscore Pound</HI> a Year, and accordingly begin a <HI>Subscription</HI> for it.</P>
<P>Some <HI>English Gentlemen</HI> had, it seems, promised him some <HI>En∣couragement</HI> towards that <HI>Sum</HI> to be raised—, and this they make a Handle of presently, and Reported that this was set up to Accom∣modate the <HI>English Strangers</HI> who could not Conform to the <HI>Presby∣terian Church.</HI></P>
<P>But the <HI>English Gentlemen</HI> seeing into the Design, and that they were to be made a Property to Embroil the <HI>Government,</HI> and foment a <HI>Division</HI> between the Two lately <HI>United Nations;</HI> They soon aban∣doned him and his <HI>Design</HI>—; However, he resolved to put his <HI>Project</HI> in Execution, and accordingly takes a <HI>House</HI> just at the <HI>Cross</HI> in <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> fits it put for a <HI>Chapel,</HI> and begins to Read the <HI>English Service.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>People,</HI> as every Body knew they would, immediately took Fire at the thing—; But not doing him the Honour to Rabble him, <HI>which seem'd to be what his Party expected;</HI> they Complain to the <HI>Magi∣strates</HI>—; The Person that had let him the <HI>House,</HI> finding what Use he was putting it to, began with him, and <HI>on Pretence of his having made some Spoil in pulling down Partitions,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>not Autho∣rized by his Contract</HI>—, Gets him Turn'd out of the <HI>House,</HI> and so he betakes himself to a Place less publick, but still goes on with his <HI>Service-Book Worship;</HI> However it gave less Offence here, the other seeming to be a Defyance of the <HI>Laws;</HI> It happened at this Time, or in a few Days after, that the <HI>Commission</HI> of the <HI>General Assembly</HI> was to meet—, as soon as they sat down, a <HI>Representation</HI> or <HI>Address</HI> is made to them by the <HI>Inhabitants</HI> of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> and other Places against this thing; The <HI>Paper</HI> mentions other <HI>Complaints</HI> indeed, but this was the Main Thing aim'd at—; The <HI>Address</HI> is as follows.</P>

<SIGNED>We the Neighbourhood of the Town of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and <HI>Suburbs</HI> Under-Subscribers, Do most Humbly Represent,</SIGNED></OPENER>
<P><HI>THat</HI> notwithstanding the many Good <HI>Laws</HI> and <HI>Acts</HI> of <HI>Parlia∣ment,</HI> and particularly the <HI>Act</HI> 6 and 7 <HI>Par.</HI> 1707, made for the <HI>Settlement</HI> and <HI>Security</HI> of this <HI>National Church,</HI> and against all <HI>Incroachments</HI> upon her <HI>Rights</HI> and <HI>Privileges,</HI> or <HI>Innovations</HI> in her <HI>Doctrine, Worship, Discipline</HI> or <HI>Government;</HI> And of <HI>Her Majesties</HI> repeated <HI>Assurances</HI> in Her <HI>Royal Proclamations, Letters</HI> to Her <HI>Privy Council,</HI> and the <HI>General Assemblies</HI> of this <HI>Church,</HI> to Maintain and Defend the same in its present <HI>Establishment,</HI> against all such unlawful <HI>Intrusions, Incroachments,</HI> and <HI>Innovations,</HI> particularly <HI>Her Maje∣sties</HI>
<PB N="xxi" REF="22"/>
<HI>Proclamations</HI> against unlawful <HI>Intruders</HI> into <HI>Churches</HI> and <HI>Manses</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> Dated <HI>Sept.</HI> 20th 1708.</P>
<P>Yet to our very great <HI>Surprise,</HI> several of the <HI>Episcopal Clergy,</HI> Promp∣ted and Instigate thereunto by the <HI>Jacobite</HI> Party, who are equally Disaf∣fected to the <HI>Civil</HI> as to the <HI>Ecclesiastical Constitution,</HI> have of late, not only Erected <HI>Meeting Houses</HI> in this <HI>City</HI> after the <HI>Scots Episcopal Way,</HI> But also in several Places here, have set up the <HI>English Service,</HI> which as it is Contrair to our <HI>Establishment,</HI> and very Grievous and Offensive to us, and all others who are well Affected to <HI>Her Majesty,</HI> and the <HI>Present Establishment,</HI> so it will prove of Fatal and Dangerous <HI>Consequence</HI> to the <HI>Church,</HI> if not speedily Remeeded.</P>
<P>It would be Considered in the first Place, That several of such as preach in these <HI>Meeting Houses,</HI> are known not only to be <HI>Unsound</HI> in their <HI>Judgments;</HI> But also <HI>Scandalous</HI> and <HI>Immoral</HI> in their <HI>Lives</HI> and <HI>Practices:</HI> And however they may pretend to be <HI>Qualified</HI> according to <HI>Law;</HI> Yet if they were not <HI>Secret</HI> and <HI>Heart Enemies</HI> to <HI>Her Majesty,</HI> and the <HI>present Government,</HI> they would never Yield themselves Tools to a <HI>Jacobite Party,</HI> for carying on their wicked and pernicious <HI>Designs.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2<HI>ly.</HI> They cannot pretend it to be a <HI>Matter</HI> of <HI>Conscience,</HI> in setting up of the <HI>English Service</HI> here, for Abstracting from <HI>Presbyterians,</HI> even the <HI>Body</HI> and <HI>Bulk</HI> of the <HI>Episcopal Perswasion</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> have never been Fond of the <HI>English Way</HI> of <HI>Worship;</HI> But upon many Occasions have Testified their <HI>Dislike</HI> of the same, and none of them Scruple to Joyn in <HI>Communion</HI> with this <HI>Church,</HI> but such as are either openly <HI>prophane,</HI> and will not Subject to <HI>Church Discipline,</HI> or avowed <HI>Jacobites.</HI> And therefore,</P>
<P N="3">3<HI>ly.</HI> We conceive, that by these Illegal and Unwarrantable <HI>Incroach∣ments, Intrusions</HI> and <HI>Innovations,</HI> they design no less than the <HI>Ruine</HI> of both <HI>Church</HI> and <HI>State;</HI> for as the setting up of the <HI>English Service</HI> here, did in former Times breed much <HI>Trouble</HI> and <HI>Confusion</HI> in this <HI>Church</HI> and <HI>Nation,</HI> so at present it does Raise and Foment <HI>Jealousies</HI> and <HI>Heart-burnings</HI> in the Minds of <HI>People,</HI> otherwise Zealously Affected to <HI>Her Majesties Person</HI> and <HI>Government,</HI> and exceedingly Widens the <HI>Breach</HI> betwixt us, and the separating <HI>Parties</HI> on both Hands; And the <HI>Instigators</HI> to, and <HI>Abbettors</HI> of these <HI>Practices</HI> are in big Hopes, and not without too good and evident Grounds, that this will prove an effectual Mean of Alienating the <HI>Hearts</HI> and <HI>Affections</HI> of many of our <HI>Queens</HI> best and most Loyal <HI>Subjects</HI> from <HI>Her Majesties Person,</HI> and the <HI>present Esta∣blishment,</HI> and that by this Means they shall effectually Wound &amp; Weaken the <HI>Church</HI> on both Sides, and also Ruine the <HI>Civil Government.</HI></P>
<P>We must also humbly <HI>Represent,</HI> That albeit we have many Good and laudable <HI>Laws</HI> and <HI>Acts</HI> of <HI>Parliament</HI> against <HI>Popery</HI> and <HI>Papists,</HI> Their Trafficking and Preaching in <HI>Scotland,</HI> particularly against their Teaching of any <HI>Science, Art</HI> and <HI>Exercise</HI> within the same, and against all <HI>Irreligion</HI> and <HI>Blasphemies,</HI> yet <HI>Papists</HI> do Openly and Avowedly <HI>Teach</HI> and <HI>Practise</HI> even within the <HI>City</HI> of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and <HI>Suburbs;</HI> And now also, a Prophane and Deluded <HI>Crew</HI> of <HI>Enthusiasts</HI> are set up in this Place, who under Pretence to the <HI>Spirit</HI> of <HI>Prophecy,</HI> do utter most horrid <HI>Blasphemies</HI> against the <HI>Ever Glorious TRINITY,</HI> such as ought not to be Suffered in any <HI>Christian Church,</HI> or <HI>Nation,</HI> seing this strikes at the very Root and Vitals of all <HI>Religion,</HI> and is set on Foot of <HI>Satan</HI> to Confound (if possible) all solid Thoughts of a <HI>DEITIE</HI> amongst us.</P>
<P>We have for <HI>Brevities</HI> sake, <HI>Represented</HI> but Few of the Many <HI>In∣conveniencies,</HI> that will certainly follow the Suffering of such <HI>Practices;</HI> And do judge it our <HI>Duty,</HI> in all Humility to lay them before the <HI>Reve∣rend Commission,</HI> seing you are set by the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Scotland,</HI> upon

<P>For the <HI>Commission</HI> of the <HI>Assembly</HI> immediately fell upon the <HI>Work,</HI> and past an <HI>Act,</HI> in which among other things, they Asserted the <HI>Legal Establishment</HI> of their <HI>Church</HI> by the <HI>Revolution,</HI> by subsequent <HI>Laws,</HI> and those <HI>Laws,</HI> receiving the <HI>General Sanction</HI> of the <HI>Union</HI>—, against all Manner of <HI>Innovation;</HI> in just Execution of which <HI>Laws,</HI> they referr'd it to the Respective <HI>Judicatories</HI> of the <HI>Church,</HI> such as <HI>Kirk Sessions,</HI> or <HI>Presbyteries,</HI> to Proceed forthwith against such <HI>Innovations,</HI> or <HI>Innovators</HI> as should be found in their Respective <HI>Bounds.</HI></P>

<P>I shall only give a Summary of their <HI>Proceedings</HI> against him, for it is not their Form of <HI>Proceeding,</HI> but the Nature of the Thing that seems to call for this prefatory <HI>Narration.</HI> It is to be Observed, that the <HI>Presbytery</HI> did not Proceed against him upon the Subject of <HI>In∣novation,</HI> or his having set up the <HI>Common-Prayer</HI>—at all, nor was it once Mentioned to him, or in the <HI>Sentence</HI> of the <HI>Presbytery</HI>—; But they first Demanded <HI>Who he was, whence he Came,</HI> and what <HI>Authority</HI> he had to Execute the <HI>Office</HI> of a <HI>Minister,</HI> and not being able to produce any <HI>Legal Ordination,</HI> or <HI>Ministerial Induction,</HI> except from the <HI>Exauctorate Deposed Bishops,</HI> to whom neither by the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Scotland's Constitution,</HI> or by the <HI>Episcopal Church</HI> of <HI>England's Constitution,</HI> any such <HI>Power</HI> or <HI>Office</HI> remained—; they Proceeded to their <HI>Sentence</HI> against him, Declaring him <HI>Uncapable</HI> to Exercise any Part of the <HI>Ministerial Function</HI> in their <HI>Bounds.</HI></P>
<P>He Declined their <HI>Authority,</HI> Treated them with <HI>Contempt,</HI> Re∣fused to <HI>Appear</HI> at their <HI>Subsequent Citation</HI>—, they took no far∣ther Notice of him, but sent a <HI>Copy</HI> of their <HI>Sentence</HI> to the <HI>Magistrates</HI>
<PB N="xxiii" REF="24"/> of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> in order to the <HI>Civil Power</HI> putting it in Execution.</P>
<P>In Pursuance of this <HI>Sentence,</HI> the <HI>Magistrates</HI> send for him, and gi∣ving him <HI>Intimation</HI> of the <HI>Sentence</HI> of the <HI>Presbytery,</HI> they give <HI>Notice</HI> that he do not presume to Preach any more within the Bounds of the <HI>City,</HI> on Pain of <HI>Imprisonment,</HI> &amp; gave him time to show his <HI>Obedience</HI> to their <HI>Order:</HI> He carries himself with the same <HI>Haughtiness</HI> to the <HI>Magistrates,</HI> tells them positively, That he would not obey them, and accordingly the next <HI>Sabbath</HI> he Preaches openly in the <HI>City;</HI> nor yet would the <HI>Magi∣strates</HI> have <HI>Committed</HI> him, had he not insolently triumphed in his <HI>Contempt</HI> of their <HI>Authority,</HI> appeared openly at the <HI>Cross,</HI> to let them see that <HI>Contempt,</HI> and by all the Methods possible to him, insulted them in the Affair of their <HI>Sentence.</HI></P>
<P>This brought the <HI>Magistrates</HI> to an absolute Necessity to <HI>Commit</HI> him, in Vindication of their <HI>Authority,</HI> and that they might not give their own <HI>Consent</HI> to be Trampled on by the whole Party; accordingly they sent for him again, and still offering him his <HI>Liberty,</HI> upon <HI>Obedience</HI> to their former <HI>Order,</HI> and the <HI>Sentence</HI> of the <HI>Presbytery</HI> which he in∣sultingly refused, they <HI>committed</HI> him to the <HI>Tolbooth</HI> of <HI>Edinburgh.</HI></P>
<P>It were very little worth while, to fill this <HI>Preface</HI> with the Story of this Person, were it not the Occasion of bringing upon the <HI>Stage Debates</HI> of several kinds, which it seems necessary to set in a clear Light to the World; in the Misrepresenting which, the <HI>Church</HI> as well as <HI>People</HI> of <HI>Scotland</HI> really receive much Wrong, to whom, I think, it is the Duty of an honest <HI>Man,</HI> as well as of a faithful <HI>Historian,</HI> to do Justice.</P>
<P><HI>The Cases are such as these,</HI> <LIST>
<ITEM>Whether the <HI>Scots</HI> in these <HI>Prosecutions</HI> are not <HI>Persecutors</HI> for <HI>Conscience?</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>Whether the <HI>Episcopal</HI> Deposed <HI>Clergy,</HI> have yet a Right to Ordain <HI>Ministers?</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>Whether the <HI>Episcopal Church</HI> of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and the establish't <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England</HI> are at all of Kin, or no?</ITEM>
<ITEM>Whether <HI>Toleration</HI> of <HI>Episcopacy,</HI> and the <HI>English Liturgy</HI> can be established in <HI>Scotland,</HI> or no?</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>I shall say something to all these, so far as Matter of <HI>Fact</HI> and a Historical <HI>Narration</HI> requires, and something by <HI>Observation,</HI> as far as the <HI>Civil Rights</HI> of <HI>Scotland</HI> are concerned, and thus far I think they are proper to be spoken to by Way of <HI>Preface:</HI> As to the <HI>Theological</HI> part of the <HI>Dispute,</HI> I shall have occasion to handle it elsewhere, neither can it be reasonable to expect it here.</P>
<P>In taking Notice of the first of these <HI>Queries,</HI> Whether the <HI>Scots</HI> in these <HI>Prosecutions</HI> are not <HI>Persecutors</HI> for <HI>Conscience?</HI></P>
<P>It may be alledged, That all <HI>Prosecutions</HI> of <HI>Law,</HI> where the <HI>Offender</HI> pleads <HI>Conscience</HI> against his <HI>Obedience,</HI> are <HI>Perse∣cutions</HI> for <HI>Conscience</HI>—; And if this be brought by Way of <HI>Argument</HI> in this Case, then my <HI>Answer</HI> is very brief; The <HI>Scots,</HI> and with them all the <HI>Christian Nations</HI> in the World; 
<PB N="xxiv" REF="25"/>
but especially the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> are <HI>Persecutors, and with∣out Question ought to be so.</HI></P>
<P>But if you will restrict the Term <HI>Persecution,</HI> to the generally received <HI>Sense</HI> of it, <HI>viz.</HI> Disturbing, Prosecuting, and Pur∣suing the peaceable <HI>Exercise</HI> of <HI>Religious orship,</HI> perform'd meerly in Obedience to the <HI>Dictates</HI> and <HI>Commands</HI> of <HI>Con∣science</HI>—: Then I may safely challenge all the World in Behalf of the People of <HI>Scotland,</HI> to shew the least Vestige or Appearance of <HI>Persecution</HI> among them.</P>
<P>I think, while I am in this <HI>Argument,</HI> Addressing my self prin∣cipally to the People of <HI>England,</HI> and among them to the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England</HI>—, I can do nothing better, than bring their own Practice to a Parallel with the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Scotland,</HI> as a strong and convincing Way of arguing, <HI>to them especially,</HI> in the Case I am upon; <HI>And First,</HI> I take the Authority of the <HI>Parliament</HI> of <HI>England</HI> against <HI>Perse∣cution,</HI> in the great <HI>Act</HI> for Settlement of the <HI>Toleration,</HI> where it is said, <HI>Whereas it is reasonable, that all just Tenderness should be shown to Tender</HI> Consciences, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Then in the <HI>Preamble</HI> of the late famous <HI>Occasional Bill,</HI> are these words, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Whereas</HI> Persecution <HI>for</HI> Con∣science <HI>sake, is contrary to the Principles of the</HI> Christian Religion, <HI>and the</HI> Doctrine <HI>of the</HI> Church <HI>of</HI> England.</Q>Take these two, and compare them with the <HI>Act 1. WILLIAM</HI> and <HI>MARY Cap.</HI>—. <HI>By</HI> which all those <HI>Ecclesiasticks</HI> who would not take the Oaths, are Deposed and Deprived <HI>ab Officio &amp; Beneficio;</HI> and it will necessarily follow, at least in my Opinion, that either the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England</HI> in Deposing the <HI>Non Jurant Clergy</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> acts <HI>contrary to her own</HI> Doctrine <HI>and the Principles of the</HI> Christian Religion, <HI>ut supra: OR,</HI> That Deposing and Depriving the <HI>Non Jurant Bishops,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Is not</HI> Per∣secution <HI>for</HI> Conscience.</P>
<P>I humbly refer this to the <HI>Determination</HI> of all that shall Read im∣partially if it be not clear and fairly stated.</P>
<P>If then Deposing and Depriving the <HI>Clergy</HI> of the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> who refufe to take the <HI>Oaths</HI> to the <HI>Government,</HI> be not <HI>Persecution;</HI> it remains for the other Party to prove, that the same thing in <HI>Scotland</HI> can be called <HI>Persecution,</HI> and in <HI>England</HI> no <HI>Persecution.</HI></P>
<P>The Deposing <HI>Episcopacy</HI> it self in <HI>Scotland,</HI> seems to come in Que∣stion here, and would require a long Discourse—; But as I am speaking chiefly to the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England</HI> in this Case, I am very wil∣ling to make her a Judge—, and I presume it will be arguing <HI>ad ho∣minem,</HI> to say, tho' I do not lay the Stress here neither.</P>
<P>That Deposing <HI>Episcopacy</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and Deposing <HI>Popery</HI> in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> stand in many Cases upon the same Foot—, and the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Scotland</HI> has offered little or no <HI>Violence</HI> to the <HI>Episcopal Church</HI> in <HI>Scotland;</HI> But what the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England</HI> has offered to the <HI>Roman Catholicks</HI> in <HI>England</HI>—: Now tho' in General this would be no Argument, yet 'tis a Reason in this Case, why the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> above all other, ought not to charge the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Scotland</HI> with <HI>Persecution</HI> in that particular—. But to go further, the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Scotland</HI> did not immediately pull down <HI>Episcopacy</HI>—,
<PB N="xxv" REF="26"/> I mean, the <HI>Church</HI> abstractly considered in her <HI>Ecclesiastical</HI> Circum∣stances—; But it was done by the <HI>Government</HI> of <HI>Scotland,</HI> the Body of the People, I mean the <HI>Parliament</HI> before the <HI>Presbyterian Church</HI> was Established—. And it is evident <HI>by the Claim of Right,</HI> that <HI>Episco∣pacy</HI> was turn'd out of <HI>Scotland,</HI> not as a thing Establisht, but as an <HI>Intrud∣er</HI> upon the Established <HI>Religion,</HI> which <HI>Scotland</HI> had from the very <HI>Re∣formation</HI> Embrac't, which they had Sworn in their <HI>National Cove∣nant</HI> to maintain, and which by <HI>Law</HI> it was their Right to restore; in short <HI>Episcopacy</HI> was turn'd out as a Man who has had his Estate ta∣ken from him by <HI>Oppression,</HI> recovers his <HI>Right</HI> by <HI>Law,</HI> and then Dis∣possesses the wrongful <HI>Incroacher</HI> or <HI>Invader,</HI> and enters upon his own.</P>
<P>Ʋniversal <HI>History</HI> will allow, That the <HI>Scots</HI> Reform'd first into the <HI>Geneva</HI> Model, by the Agency of the famous <HI>John Knox</HI> and others, and that they had no <HI>Episcopacy</HI> in their first <HI>Establishment</HI> at all; nor can all the Labour that has been spent to make the <HI>Superintendents,</HI> who were sent into the several Parts of the Kingdom, to settle <HI>Ecclesiastick</HI> Affairs, <HI>look like Bishops</HI>—, for this will for ever supercede that Suggestion, <HI>viz.</HI> That these <HI>Superintendents,</HI> tho' Vested with <HI>Power</HI> over the <HI>Ministers</HI> they went to Visit—, yet received that <HI>Power</HI> from, and exercised it in Subordination to the <HI>General Assembly</HI> of the <HI>Presbyterian Church</HI>—, and were often called to an Account, Censured, and Removed by the <HI>Synods,</HI> nay and some say, even by pri∣vate <HI>Presbyteries,</HI> See <HI>Calderwood's History of the Church of</HI> Scotland <HI>Fol.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Episcopacy</HI> in <HI>Scotland</HI> being thus supposed an <HI>Invader</HI> and <HI>Spoiler,</HI> the <HI>Revolution</HI> did no more than take from them their usurped <HI>Authority,</HI> cause them to Disgorge what they had most unjustly devoured, and the <HI>In∣vader</HI> having thus been turned out, the right <HI>Owners</HI> of the <HI>House</HI> came again, and took Possession of their own; <HI>And this can by no means be called</HI> Persecution.</P>
<P>My second <HI>Enquiry</HI> is upon <HI>a new Dispute,</HI> and I think admits of no Difficulties in Matters of <HI>Law,</HI> whatever it may in Matters of <HI>Con∣science</HI>—viz. <HI>Whether the Deposed Exauctorate</HI> Bishops <HI>have</HI> Power <HI>left to Ordain</HI> Ministers—? Indeed the Question seems rather to ly here, Whether such <HI>Preachers</HI> as shall be Licensed or Ordain∣ed by the Exauctorate <HI>Bishops,</HI> ought to be esteem'd as <HI>Ministers,</HI> espe∣cially in that <HI>Church</HI> which has so Deposed them—? This being the present Debate, it rather respects the <HI>Civil</HI> than <HI>Ecclesiastick</HI> Part of the Question.</P>
<P>It seems to me highly absurd, that the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England</HI> should receive as a <HI>Minister</HI> among them, a Man Ordain'd <HI>BY HIM WHOM</HI> they will not owne or receive as a <HI>Minister</HI> of their <HI>Church;</HI> for if the <HI>Bishop</HI> after Deprivation shall Ordain <HI>Ministers,</HI> how then is that <HI>Bishop</HI> Deprived <HI>AB OFFICIO</HI>—? Nor indeed do I know that the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England</HI> has at all admitted this Absurdity among them—; The thing is only started in <HI>Scotland</HI> to beget new Broils on that Head, and it seems still more absurd, that the <HI>Non Jurant Bishops</HI> in <HI>Scotland</HI> should have <HI>Power</HI> to Ordain a <HI>Minister</HI> of the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>But to support this Absurdity, a worse is started among us, <HI>viz.</HI> That the <HI>Episcopal Church</HI> of <HI>Scotland</HI> is Incorporated into the <HI>Church</HI> of 
<PB N="xxvi" REF="27"/>
<HI>England</HI> by the <HI>UNION,</HI> and this is the <HI>Reason</HI> of my Third <HI>En∣quiry.</HI> 
<LIST>
<ITEM>3. <HI>Whether the</HI> Episcopal Church <HI>of</HI> Scotland, <HI>and the present</HI> Establisht Church <HI>of</HI> England, <HI>are at all of</HI> Kin, <HI>or no?</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>This <HI>Enquiry,</HI> if it be directly Trac'd, will lead to a New <HI>Questi∣on, viz.</HI> What is to be Meant by the <HI>Church of</HI> England? <HI>I mean in this Question onely</HI>—, and therefore I shall <HI>Answer</HI> it both Ways very briefly.</P>
<P>If by the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England</HI> we mean, The <HI>Church</HI> as now Esta∣blish'd, or rather Recognized by the <HI>Revolution</HI>—, and now <HI>Re∣ceiv'd</HI> and <HI>Acknowledged</HI> by the <HI>QUEEN</HI> and <HI>Parliament;</HI> Then indeed this pretended <HI>Incorporation,</HI> is an <HI>Absurdity</HI>—, and there is no more any such thing, than there is an <HI>Incorporation</HI> between <HI>GOD</HI> and <HI>Baal;</HI> for the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England</HI> so <HI>Understood</HI> has spued the other out as <HI>Illegal,</HI> has Rejected Her as <HI>Jacobite,</HI> and has Joyn'd in and Consented to <HI>by the UNION,</HI> the <HI>Establishment</HI> of the <HI>Pres∣byterian Church</HI> in her Stead, and upon her Ruines, as the <HI>True Pro∣testant Religion,</HI> and <HI>Establisht National Church</HI> of <HI>Scotland, vide</HI> the <HI>Act</HI> of <HI>UNION,</HI> and from this Stipulation, she (the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England</HI>) her self, can not go back—; But if on the other Hand, by the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> is to be understood the <HI>Dodwellian-Jaco∣bite-Faction</HI> of the <HI>Church,</HI> who refuse to own either the <HI>Religous</HI> or <HI>Civil Establishment</HI> now Reigning in <HI>Britain,</HI> esteeming the QUEEN an <HI>Usurper,</HI> the <HI>Revolution</HI> a <HI>Rebellion,</HI> and the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England Schismatical</HI>—, if <HI>thus they Understand</HI> the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> then they and the <HI>Episcopal Church</HI> of <HI>Scotland,</HI> may for ought I know, be <HI>Incorporated</HI> into each other, and may be esteemed <HI>One Body</HI>—; and <HI>they are welcome to be so accounted:</HI> But how this is done by the <HI>Union,</HI> remains for those <HI>Gentlemen</HI> who pretend to it to make <HI>Out.</HI></P>
<P>I think, I need not Descend to many <HI>Arguments</HI> in this <HI>Case,</HI> the <HI>Case</HI> is evident, the <HI>Episcopal Church</HI> in <HI>Scotland</HI> being entirely <HI>Ja∣cobite</HI> at this Time, can not be said to <HI>Incorporate</HI> with the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> who Acknowledge <HI>Queen ANNE,</HI> because they <HI>Reject</HI> Her as <HI>Schismatical</HI> and <HI>Apostate</HI>—, and that they can <HI>Reject</HI> Her, and be <HI>Incorporated</HI> into Her at the same Time, seems <HI>Impracticable</HI> and <HI>Absurd.</HI></P>
<P>It remains to Enquire, <HI>whether</HI> Episcopacy <HI>and the</HI> English Liturgy <HI>may not be Tolerated in</HI> Scotland—; and here I shall wave the various <HI>Arguments</HI> about the <HI>Necessity</HI> and <HI>Obligation</HI> which lyes on all <HI>Christians</HI> to pay <HI>Reverence</HI> to <HI>Conscience,</HI> and in Order to give all possible <HI>Liberty</HI> to <HI>Religious Opinions</HI>—; but I shall lay the <HI>Stress</HI> of my present <HI>Arguing</HI> another way.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> Speaking of <HI>Scotland,</HI> we are to Distinguish between Tolerat∣ing of <HI>Episcopacy,</HI> and Tolerating of <HI>Jacobitism</HI>—, and if this be Distinguisht right here, we shall have little need of the <HI>Question</HI> at all—; And in the Name of the <HI>Scots,</HI> I may very well say to the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England</HI>—, <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> when you please to Tolerate <HI>Jacobitism</HI> by <HI>Law</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> we will Consider of Tolerating <HI>E∣piscpacy</HI>
<PB N="xxvii" REF="28"/> in <HI>Scotland</HI>—, and this way of <HI>Arguing</HI> seems very just, because if you please to Abstract <HI>Jacobitism</HI> from <HI>Episcopacy</HI> in <HI>Scot∣land,</HI> you will leave no <HI>Episcopacy</HI> there, but what is already To∣lerated by <HI>Law</HI>—, <HI>viz.</HI> by the <HI>Act</HI> the first <HI>Perliament</HI> WIL∣LIAM <HI>and</HI> MARY, which Ordained that all those <HI>Episcopal Ministers</HI> who would take the <HI>Oaths</HI> should Continue in their <HI>Churches</HI>—, <HI>and there they remain to this Day,</HI> a kind of <HI>Toleration</HI> much Superior to that in <HI>England,</HI> for these Enjoy the <HI>Presbyterian Stipends</HI> and <HI>Manses</HI>—, and in some of their <HI>Parishes</HI> the <HI>Establisht Church Mi∣nisters</HI> Preach by them in <HI>Meeting Houses</HI> to this Hour, as Mr. <HI>Ponton</HI> in <HI>Kinghorn,</HI> and others, if the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England</HI> will not call this <HI>Toleration,</HI> they will find it hard to tell us what is <HI>Toleration.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Champions</HI> of this <HI>Toleration Project,</HI> finding this <HI>Argument</HI> turned too Hard upon them—, have set up a New One—, and which therefore I have added in the <HI>Question,</HI> and this is about Tolerat∣ing the <HI>Common-Prayer Book</HI> in <HI>Scotland</HI>—, and this brings a New <HI>Dispute</HI> upon the <HI>Stage</HI>—, a <HI>Dispute</HI> that seems to have more <HI>Policy</HI> than <HI>Religion</HI> in it, and I doubt not but it will soon be Detected.</P>
<P>That this is not a <HI>Case</HI> of <HI>Conscience,</HI> but a <HI>Party Trick</HI> to Em∣broil, will appear, if we Consider two or three Things.<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That for <HI>twenty eight</HI> Years preceeding the <HI>Revolution,</HI> when the <HI>Episcopal Church</HI> was (humanely speaking) Tri∣umphant in <HI>Scotland,</HI> they never admitted of the <HI>English Liturgy</HI> among them; nor was it ever Attempted for 100 Years before, but once by Arch-bishop <HI>Laud</HI> and his <HI>Party,</HI> which <HI>Attempt</HI> was the <HI>Overthrow</HI> of all the <HI>Contrivers,</HI> and it is more than Probable may be so again, if they go on with it; This proves it is not any part of the <HI>Profession</HI> of the <HI>Episcopal Church</HI> of <HI>Scotland</HI>—, and therefore can not be said to be Demanded in behalf of <HI>Conscience.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. From the <HI>Revolution</HI> to the Time of the <HI>Union,</HI> during which Time the <HI>Episcopal non-jurant Clergy</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> have Erected several <HI>Meetings</HI> or <HI>Conventicles</HI> of their Party for <HI>Re∣ligious Worship</HI>—, they have had very little Thought of the <HI>English Liturgy,</HI>—but what of it is come among them, is a meer <HI>Innovation</HI> thrust in upon them by the Artifice of a <HI>Party,</HI> in part to claim <HI>Kindred</HI> of the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> and partly to Inflame and Enrage the <HI>People</HI> of <HI>Scotland,</HI> who they know are <HI>Averse</HI> to it.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. At this Time, while the <HI>Leaders</HI> of the <HI>Party</HI> are Impo∣sing this upon the <HI>Church</HI> and <HI>People</HI> of <HI>Scotland</HI>—; They have some Difficulty to make their own <HI>People</HI> Agree to, and Espouse it—, the thing is so far from being Desired by the <HI>People</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> that even these who frequent their <HI>Meetings,</HI> that are <HI>Episcopal</HI> in <HI>Religious Principles,</HI> and <HI>Jacobite</HI> in <HI>Politick Principles,</HI> yet Shun the <HI>Liturgy,</HI> Dislike it—, and are with <HI>Difficulty</HI> and <HI>Reluctance</HI> brought to bear it; nay in most Parts they will not <HI>Comply</HI> with it, but <HI>Abandon</HI> those that Read it, and Throng after those <HI>Episcopal Ministers</HI> that Decline it.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P><PB N="xviii" REF="29"/>
These are Sufficient to make it appear, that the <HI>Attempt</HI> of Erecting the <HI>Common Prayer-Book</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> is not founded in the <HI>Consci∣ences</HI> of the <HI>People</HI>—, That it is a <HI>Politck Design</HI> to carry on a <HI>Par∣ty Interest</HI> among us in <HI>England,</HI> and Embroil, if possible, the <HI>People</HI> of <HI>Scotland</HI> with the <HI>Government,</HI> is evident from the last <HI>Head,</HI> that they are at Pains to bring their own <HI>People</HI> to Espouse it, which if it were not to Serve their <HI>Civil Interest,</HI> it will be hard to Suggest on what <HI>Foundation</HI> they make the <HI>Attempt.</HI></P>
<P>But I come next to <HI>Enquire</HI> into the <HI>Civil Rights</HI> of <HI>Scotland</HI> as they stand, either <HI>Supported</HI> or <HI>Invaded</HI> by this <HI>Attempt</HI>—; if then the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Scotland</HI> has a <HI>Civil Right</HI> to the <HI>Ecclesiastick Immunity</HI> she Enjoys, and that the <HI>Union</HI> had Confirmed these <HI>Rights,</HI> then nothing can be Imposed upon her, against her present <HI>Settlement,</HI> without Breach of the <HI>Union:</HI> And this I presume to say, No <HI>Hu∣mane Authority</HI> now Establisht in <HI>Britain,</HI> can so much as Attempt without <HI>Dissolving</HI> the very <HI>Constitution.</HI></P>
<P>By the <HI>UNION</HI> then, and the several <HI>Acts</HI> of <HI>Parliament</HI> for the <HI>Security</HI> of the <HI>Presbyterian Church,</HI> which are Confirmed by, and made <HI>Part</HI> of that <HI>Union</HI>—; The <HI>Purity</HI> and <HI>Uniformity</HI> of the <HI>Worship, Discipline</HI> and <HI>Government</HI> of the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Scotland</HI> is to be Preserved <HI>to the People of</HI> Scotland WITHOUT ANT AL∣TERATION, Mark these <HI>Words,</HI> I Repeat them again, WITHOUT ANT ALTERATION to all <HI>Succeeding Generations.</HI></P>
<P>If any Man will say, That Tolerating the <HI>Common Prayer</HI> can Consist with <HI>Preserving</HI> the <HI>Uniformity</HI> of the <HI>Worship</HI>—, or the Tolerating <HI>Episcopacy</HI> can Consist with the preserving the <HI>Government</HI> of the <HI>Church,</HI> or either of them with Preserving the <HI>Discipline;</HI> then I may be ready to Enquire further.</P>
<P>On the other Hand, if they are not, then they cannot be offered to the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Scotland;</HI> nor can even the <HI>Parliament</HI> of <HI>Britain</HI> Erect such a <HI>Toleration</HI> without <HI>Invading</HI> the <HI>UNION,</HI> which I hum∣bly conceive they have not <HI>Power</HI> to do.</P>
<P>Nor can the <HI>Church</HI> or <HI>People</HI> of <HI>Scotland</HI> legally give their <HI>Consent</HI> to any such <HI>Act</HI> of <HI>Toleration;</HI> because this <HI>Purity</HI> and <HI>Uniformity</HI> is to be <HI>Preserved</HI> to all <HI>Succeeding Generations;</HI> and the present <HI>Ge∣neration</HI> has no more <HI>Power</HI> to give up what by the <HI>Union</HI> is thus En∣tailed on their <HI>Posterity,</HI> than the <HI>Parliament</HI> can give up what is Conceded to the said Present Generation.</P>
<P>By this it seems, the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Scotland</HI> is so Established, that neither can her <HI>Enemies</HI> Impose <HI>Toleration</HI> upon her; neither can her Treacherous or Negligent <HI>Friends,</HI> too many of whom she may have <HI>in Power,</HI> give up her <HI>Claim</HI> to her <HI>Establishment;</HI> neither can she her self Abandon her <HI>Right</HI> to, or her <HI>Possession</HI> of her <HI>Esta∣blishment,</HI> Exclusive of all manner of <HI>Innovations</HI> or <HI>Invasious</HI> on the <HI>Purity</HI> and <HI>Uniformity</HI> of her <HI>Worship, Discipline</HI> or <HI>Government.</HI></P>
<P>This I think is the present State of the <HI>Question</HI> about <HI>Toleration</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> what Gloss the Artifice of <HI>Enemies,</HI> and the Craft of <HI>Parties</HI> may put upon the <HI>Attempts</HI> now making, of Invading the <HI>Pri∣vileges</HI> of the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Scotland,</HI> I have nothing to do with in
<PB N="xxix" REF="30"/>
this <HI>Treatise;</HI> I am sure if the <HI>Representatives</HI> of <HI>Scotland</HI> are <HI>Faith∣ful</HI> and <HI>Vigilant,</HI> she is in no <HI>Danger</HI>—; nor can Her <HI>Church Pri∣vileges</HI> be Invaded by a <HI>Toleration,</HI> without Destroying the <HI>Civil</HI> as well as <HI>Ecclesiastick Constitution,</HI> upon which whole <HI>Britain</HI> is at this Time Establisht by the <HI>UNION.</HI></P>
<P>Two Things I find fall naturally in our Way as <HI>Objections</HI> (in <HI>England especially,</HI>) when we <HI>argue</HI> against Tolerating the <HI>English Liturgy</HI> in <HI>Scotland; First,</HI> That this is falling upon the <HI>Common Prayer Book,</HI> and Insulting the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England</HI>—; And <HI>Secondly,</HI> That this will be Injurious to the <HI>Toleration</HI> which the <HI>Dissenters</HI> Enjoy in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>It is most certain in strict Justice, That tho' both these were true, it makes nothing to the <HI>Argument.</HI> The <HI>Question</HI> is not of Civility to the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> or of Prudentials to the <HI>Dissenters</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> but of <HI>Right</HI> and <HI>Justice</HI> to the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Scotland</HI>—, We are here in a <HI>Right</HI> of <HI>Property</HI> Capitulated for by the <HI>UNION,</HI> Sti∣pulated for, and Agreed to by the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> that <HI>no Alte∣ration</HI> shall be made; that the <HI>Purity</HI> and <HI>Uniformity</HI> shall be Pre∣served: Either it is Preserved, or it is not—; If the <HI>Common Prayer</HI> be Imposed on them; If <HI>Episcopacy</HI> be Tolerated, their <HI>Wor∣ship</HI> and <HI>Government</HI> is Altered, or it is not—; if it be, then the <HI>Union</HI> is Invaded, or it is not; the <HI>Questions</HI> are short, and need no Cavilling—, tho' speaking of the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> and of the <HI>Dissenters</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> The <HI>Scots</HI> may be Civil to one, and Careful of the other; yet they must not give up their <HI>Establisht Rights</HI> on that Score, this were to Complement them at too great an <HI>Expence</HI>—: Would the <HI>Conscientious Episcopal People</HI> in <HI>Scotland</HI> be Easy, no <HI>Body</HI> Molested them, they Enjoyed their <HI>Liberty</HI> Unmolested enough, and in a manner which the <HI>Dissenters</HI> in <HI>England</HI> for many Years would have Rejoyc'd at—; but when nothing will Satisfy, but <HI>Encroach∣ing</HI> upon <HI>Declared</HI> and <HI>Establisht Rights,</HI> the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Scotland</HI> is then bound to Assert her own <HI>Property,</HI> and neither the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England</HI> or the <HI>Dissenters</HI> ought to take it ill from them.</P>
<P>But after all, the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England</HI> have no Reason to <HI>take it ill,</HI> that the <HI>Scots</HI> do not make Use of the <HI>Common Prayer,</HI> any more than the <HI>Scots</HI> have to <HI>take it ill,</HI> that the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England</HI> do not make Use of the <HI>Presbyterian Discipline;</HI> They are two <HI>National Churches;</HI> Either of them have their respective <HI>Kingdom</HI> to which they belong, <HI>Constitution</HI> on which they are built, and <HI>Laws</HI> by which they are Establisht; They are perfectly <HI>Independent</HI> one of another, and have no <HI>Superiority</HI> over, or <HI>Subjection</HI> to one another—, They are <HI>Confederated</HI> by the <HI>UNION,</HI> and the <HI>Butts</HI> and <HI>Bounds</HI> of their respective <HI>Influence,</HI> are <HI>Stated</HI> and Irreversibly <HI>Determined,</HI> I say, they are but Confederated, <HI>for it is no more,</HI> the <HI>Kingdoms</HI> are <HI>In∣corporated,</HI> but the <HI>Churches</HI> are but <HI>Confederated;</HI> but the <HI>Links</HI> of this <HI>Chain</HI> are so nicely Twisted together, that the <HI>Confederacy</HI> can not be <HI>Broken</HI> withouthout <HI>Destroying</HI> the <HI>Incorporation,</HI> and the One is the <HI>Bond</HI> of the Other—; It can then be no <HI>Affront</HI> to the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> to have the <HI>Scots</HI> say, We will have nothing to
<PB N="xxx" REF="31"/>
do with your <HI>Common Prayer</HI>—, Nor to the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Scotland,</HI> to have the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England</HI> say, We will have nothing to do with your <HI>Presbyterian Discipline</HI>—: It was the Great <HI>Preliminary</HI> of the <HI>Treaty,</HI> That the <HI>Churches</HI> of either <HI>Kingdom,</HI> should have nothing to do with One Another—; And therefore the <HI>Treaters</HI> on both Hands, were expresly Forbid to Meddle with the <HI>Affair</HI> of the <HI>Church</HI>—, whose <HI>Establishments,</HI> it was found absolutely Necessary should not in the least Interfere with One Another—, nor their respective <HI>Jurisdiction</HI> be Suffered to <HI>Incroach</HI> upon, or <HI>Invade</HI> One the Other. If any have Reason therefore, to <HI>take ill</HI> any thing from the Other, the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Scotland</HI> has the first <HI>Offence</HI> given her, by this <HI>Attempt</HI> of <HI>In∣vading</HI> her <HI>Uniformity;</HI> Only this is to be said for it, That it is the <HI>Act</HI> and <HI>Deed</HI> of a <HI>Party,</HI> not of the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> Consi∣dered as a <HI>Church.</HI></P>
<P>As to the <HI>Danger</HI> to the <HI>Dissenters,</HI> with Respect to the <HI>Tolerati∣on</HI> they now Enjoy in <HI>England</HI>—; The <HI>Fears</HI> of that seem to be altogether Groundless, to any Man that Rightly <HI>Understands,</HI> either the Nature of the <HI>Toleration</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> or the <HI>State</HI> of the <HI>Question</HI> concerning <HI>Toleration</HI> in <HI>Scotland</HI>—, in which it is Mani∣fest, that the <HI>Difference</HI> is so Wide, that no <HI>Argument</HI> can be drawn from the One to the Other, either to <HI>Strengthen</HI> or <HI>Destroy.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Scots</HI> Oppose a <HI>Toleration</HI> by a <HI>Claim</HI> of <HI>Right,</HI> stipulated be∣tween the Two <HI>Nations,</HI> and it is evident—, when the <HI>Act</HI> for <HI>Se∣curity</HI> of the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Scotland</HI> was past in <HI>Scotland</HI>—, this very Matter of <HI>Toleration</HI> was not a little Debated, and the <HI>Presbyterian Opposers</HI> of the <HI>UNION</HI> in <HI>Scotland</HI> were not Backward to express their Apprehensions of a <HI>Toleration</HI> being Brought upon them by the <HI>UNION</HI>—, They were <HI>Answered</HI> by the <HI>Act</HI> of <HI>Security,</HI> which was supposed, believed, and intended to be Effectual against <HI>such a Thing</HI>—, and had they not thought it Sufficient, but insisted in <HI>Words</HI> at length, That <HI>the</HI> English Liturgy <HI>should not have been Tolerated,</HI> or at all Used in <HI>Scotland</HI> in Publick. I may Appeal to all the <HI>Gentle∣men</HI> Concern'd, either in <HI>Scotland,</HI> or here in <HI>England,</HI> That it would not have been Denyed—; And the <HI>Author</HI> of this is Witness to <HI>Large Assurances</HI> given to this Purpose; but it was thought Modester to set it down in less pointed Terms—, no Man Doubting but that an <HI>Article</HI> to Preserve the <HI>Uniformity</HI> of <HI>Worship</HI> in the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Scotland,</HI> WITHOUT ANY ALTERATION in all <HI>Succeeding Genera∣tions,</HI> must be supposed to contain a Sufficient <HI>Security</HI> against the <HI>English Liturgy.</HI></P>
<P>Now it would seem a very Gross <HI>Suggestion,</HI> and Reproach the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England</HI> with strange <HI>Injustice,</HI> to allege that they should Discontinue their <HI>Toleration</HI> to <HI>Protestant Dissenters</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> be∣cause they themselves, having Consented to the <HI>Exclusion</HI> of <HI>Episco∣pacy</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> the <HI>Scots</HI> hold them to their <HI>Bargain.</HI></P>
<P>Besides the <HI>Toleration</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> would <HI>the</HI> Dissenters <HI>see their own Right to it,</HI> has a Legal <HI>Claim,</HI> and a <HI>Capitulation</HI> also on which it is Founded, and can not without Manifest <HI>Injustice</HI> be Invaded by the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> but to Invade it, because the <HI>Scots</HI> will not Tolerate <HI>Episcopacy,</HI> which they (the <HI>English</HI>) Consented should
<PB N="xxxi" REF="32"/>
not be Tolerated, would be a double <HI>Injustice,</HI> and is a <HI>Reproach</HI> to the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> so much as to imagine.</P>
<P>I think this Argument needs no further Discourse—; The <HI>Scots</HI> do insist upon it, that by the <HI>UNION</HI> they ought not, and by tha <HI>Constitution</HI> of their <HI>Church</HI> they can not admit the <HI>Common-Prayer Book</HI> to be publickly used in <HI>Scotland</HI>—; and those that offer it to them, know the People there will by no means bear it—, I am loath to say that's the chief <HI>Motive</HI> of the <HI>Attempt.</HI></P>
<P>Several other <HI>Disputes</HI> happned in <HI>Scotland</HI> after the <HI>UNION,</HI> which can not be brought into the Compass of a <HI>Preface,</HI> and must be refer'd to the fur∣ther <HI>Histories</HI> of those <HI>Times</HI>—; As the <HI>Act</HI> for making the <HI>Trials</HI> in Cases of <HI>High Treason,</HI> the same in both <HI>Countries</HI>—; Occa∣sioned, as is Noted before, by the <HI>Disputes</HI> which happened at the <HI>Trials</HI> of the four <HI>Gentlemen</HI> brought from <HI>England</HI> on the <HI>Invasion.</HI></P>
<P>The Case of the <HI>Drawbacks</HI> on <HI>Fish</HI> Cured with <HI>Foreign Salt Im∣ported</HI> between the making the <HI>UNION,</HI> and the <HI>first</HI> of <HI>May,</HI> which being a <HI>Debate</HI> that can never happen again, is not Material; only to Note, that tho' the <HI>Intent</HI> and <HI>Meaning</HI> of the <HI>Act</HI> of <HI>UNION,</HI> was not for them, nor indeed the <HI>Equity</HI> of the Case—; For they could not be sup∣posed to <HI>Drawback</HI> what they never paid, yet the Letter of the <HI>UNION</HI> being for them, the <HI>Parliament</HI> Voted them their <HI>Money,</HI> which was a <HI>Testimony</HI> of the Regard the <HI>British Parliament</HI> always have, and must always have to the <HI>UNION;</HI> The Case in short was this,</P>
<P>By the Eighth <HI>Article</HI> of the <HI>UNION,</HI> several <HI>Allowances</HI> are made, as <HI>Drawbacks</HI> upon <HI>Fish</HI> Cured in <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>Exported</HI> again—; The reason of this <HI>Allowance,</HI> was, because the Salt with which they are Cured paying a great <HI>Duty</HI>—, that <HI>Duty</HI> ought to be drawn back upon <HI>Exportation</HI>—; Now between the Ratifying the <HI>Treaty</HI> and the <HI>first</HI> of <HI>May,</HI> when it was to take Place, a very great Quantity of Foreign Salt <HI>(French)</HI> was <HI>Imported,</HI> which by the passing all the <HI>Goods</HI> so <HI>Imported</HI> as before, paid none of the <HI>English Duties</HI>—. Now it was alledged, that as the <HI>Duty</HI> did not <HI>Commence</HI> upon the <HI>Salt,</HI> so the <HI>Drawback</HI> ought not to <HI>Commence,</HI> which was the <HI>Effect</HI> of that <HI>Duty</HI>—; But the Letter of the <HI>Act</HI> being express <HI>Article</HI> the <HI>VIII. That all</HI> Fish <HI>Cured with Foreign</HI> Salt <HI>shall Drawback,</HI> &amp;c. The <HI>Parliament</HI> Voted it, and <HI>Scotland</HI> got about Twenty Seven Thousand Pound <HI>Sterling Drawback,</HI> where they paid little or nothing of <HI>Duty.</HI></P>
<P>I do not remember any thing Material that happened in this <HI>Inter∣val,</HI> more than what has been hinted at here—; The <HI>Parliament</HI> of <HI>BRITAIN</HI> went on to Ease the <HI>Scots</HI> in every Thing that came be∣fore them, and except the <HI>Act</HI> above-mentioned about <HI>Treason,</HI> I know nothing that past against the <HI>Joynt Opinion</HI> of the <HI>Scots Mem∣bers</HI> in Two <HI>Sessions</HI> of <HI>Parliament,</HI> which have sat before the writing these <HI>Sheets.</HI></P>
<P>I have now, only a few things to take notice of here, relating to the <HI>Performance</HI> of the <HI>Work</HI>—, which I must make some <HI>Apology</HI> for, and which shall close this <HI>Preface.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="xxxii" REF="33"/><HI>First,</HI> That there are some <HI>Acts</HI> of <HI>Parliament, which</HI> in the <HI>Book,</HI> are refer'd to, as Printed in the <HI>Appendix, but are not there</HI>—; As the <HI>Act</HI> of <HI>Security</HI> of <HI>Scotland</HI> formerly past there—; The <HI>Act</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> Intituled, <HI>An</HI> Act <HI>for pre∣venting Dangers arising from the said Act of</HI> Security in <HI>Scot∣land</HI>—; The several <HI>Acts</HI> of <HI>Parliament</HI> for Naming <HI>Com∣missioners</HI> for the <HI>Treaties</HI>—; And the <HI>Act</HI> for <HI>Plantation of Kirks and Valuation of Teinds</HI>—. These <HI>Acts</HI> being all Publick, and to be found in the several <HI>Volumes</HI> of <HI>Acts</HI> of <HI>Parliament</HI> of the respective <HI>Kingdoms,</HI> I have Omitted in the <HI>Appendix, an needless,</HI> tho' refer'd to in the <HI>Book</HI>—; The <HI>Appendix</HI> also swelling beyond my Expectation.</P>
<P>A <HI>Note</HI> also of the Difference of the several <HI>Duties</HI> on <HI>Goods Ex∣ported</HI> and <HI>Imported</HI> before, and after the <HI>UNION,</HI> and of the <HI>Sta∣tions</HI> of the <HI>Custom-House Cruizers</HI> mentioned <HI>Fol.</HI> 12. of the <HI>first Appendix,</HI> and refer'd to N. R. <HI>S. T. V. Xxx.</HI> of the <HI>second Ap∣pendix,</HI> are Omitted, the <HI>first,</HI> as needless, a <HI>Book</HI> of <HI>Rates</HI> of both being afterward Published in <HI>Scotland</HI>—: The <HI>second</HI> as void by the Course of things, the said <HI>Cruizers</HI> having never been built.</P>
<P><HI>Fol.</HI> 5. of the <HI>first Appendix,</HI> the last <HI>Paragraph</HI> but one, mention is made of a <HI>Calculation</HI> of the Damages done to the <HI>Revenue,</HI> by the <HI>Importation</HI> of <HI>French Goods</HI> into <HI>Scotland,</HI> between the End of the <HI>Treaty</HI> and the first of <HI>May</HI>—; But I find my self obliged to ac∣knowledge ingenuously, that after many <HI>Essays</HI> to obtain <HI>such</HI> a <HI>Compu∣tation,</HI> I could never come to any <HI>Account</HI> so exact as I could depend upon, or venture to Publish.</P>
<P>The <HI>Irregularity</HI> of the <HI>Appendix,</HI> may deserve some Excuse, but the various <HI>Times</HI> in which the several Parts were wrote, even some before others were Acted, were the true Reason of the <HI>Irregular</HI> placing of the Pieces; And 'tis hoped the <HI>Reader</HI> will accept that for a Reason.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>Work</HI> it self—, I shall say nothing, but leave it to the <HI>Charity</HI> of the <HI>World,</HI> which in this <HI>Age</HI> indeed runs very low. It has many <HI>Difficulties</HI> in its Way, many <HI>Factions</HI> and <HI>Parties</HI> to please—, and must be <HI>Censur'd</HI> by some; I have endeavoured to speak <HI>Truth,</HI> and relate <HI>Fact</HI> Impartially in all that is Matter of <HI>History;</HI> As to my own <HI>Observations,</HI> they are but my <HI>Opinions,</HI> and they must abide the Fiercest <HI>Attacks</HI> of <HI>Parties,</HI> as the <HI>Passions</HI> and <HI>Interests</HI> of <HI>Men</HI> guide them—, and I am perfectly Ʋnconcerned at the Event.</P>

<HEAD>A GENERAL HISTORY OF UNIONS IN BRITAIN.</HEAD>
<P>IN order to come to a clear Understanding in the whole Frame of this wonderful Transaction, THE UNION, 'tis ne∣cessary to let the Reader into the very Original of it, and Enquire where the first Springs are to be found, from whence this mighty Transaction has been Form'd.</P>
<P>And tho' this will of course lead us back a great way into History, yet it will carry this Advantage along with it, that we shall see all the several Steps which have been taken, how Providence has led the Nations, as it were, by the Hand, and brought them by the Hints of their mutual Disasters, to seek this Treaty, as the only Harbour the Ship of the State could safely come to an Anchor in.</P>
<P>Nor is it unworthy Observation, especially to those who love to remark the Connection of Providences in the Affairs of this World, and the various Turns the Island of <HI>Britain</HI> has had in the Compass of a few past Years; All which have had their direct Tendency to this great Event, tho' perfectly Unforeseen, either by the Actors or the Lookers on in those Ages.</P>
<P>The Animosities between these two Nations, would require a great deal of Time and Art to Describe, they are not so remarkable for their Antiquity and Original, as for their Nature and Circum∣stances.</P>
<P>Never two Nations that had so much Affinity in Circumstances, have had such Inveteracy and Aversion to one another in their Blood.</P>
<P>They have been both the Inhabitants of the Richest, the Beauti∣fullest, &amp; most populous Island in the World. And by frequent mutual
<PB N="2" REF="35"/>
Invasions made upon them, by the same Foreign Nations, who have left their Race behind them, it is not at all an Excursion to say, They are the same in Blood, of the same Off-spring, and became Inhabitants the same way.</P>
<P>If it be Objected, That the North and North-West Parts of <HI>Scot∣land,</HI> are <HI>Irish,</HI> and retain both the Sirnames, Manners, and Language of the <HI>Irish,</HI> or the Ancient <HI>Scoti,</HI> from whence the whole Kingdom had its Name; It is also Answered, so has <HI>England</HI> in <HI>Wales, Cornwal,</HI> &amp; <HI>Westmorland</HI> the Ancient <HI>Britains,</HI> who retain their Sirnames, Manners and Languages, as distinctly as the Highlanders in the North, or the <HI>Irish</HI> in the Islands of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>But take the South Part of <HI>Scotland,</HI> on this fide the <HI>Tay,</HI> the In∣habitants, <HI>tho' very Ancient,</HI> must be allowed to be the Remains of the <HI>Roman</HI> Colonies, afterwards of the <HI>Danes,</HI> some <HI>Saxons;</HI> and among all these, the <HI>Picts,</HI> who we suppose, to have been the An∣cient Inhabitants.</P>
<P>'Tis true, <HI>England</HI> is much more mixt in Blood, and the Reason of this is plain, in that, being a Nation powerful in Wealth, Fruit∣ful in Soil, and above all, increasing in Commerce, more Nations have sought to settle among them, numbers of People have flowed in upon them, from all Parts of the World, and blending their Blood with the most ancient Families, have destroyed all that can be called National, as to Antiquity among them, and they do not pretend to it.</P>
<P>Whereas in <HI>Scotland,</HI> under all the Mixtures they have suffered, their ancient Families seem to have been preserved, and Foreign Nations have only seemed to increase their Number.</P>
<P>However this be, there is Nearness of Blood enough, I mean as to Originals, to have occasioned some Propensity to Coalition, and mutual Neighbourhood between the Nations; &amp; one would have thought, some happy Accident might have fallen out, some Lucid Interval, some convenient Crisis of Circumstances, or Juncture of Inclination, to have brought them together, made them fast Friends, and so have joyn'd their victorious Arms, to the Terrour of their Neighbours.</P>
<P>But the Rancor has run in the Blood, the Hatred between the Nations, has lookt like a meer Original, a sort of Antipathy, Here∣detary from Generation, Born with the very Nations, and has long Threatned us with being too fast rooted there, ever to be remov'd, but <HI>like a malignant rank Leprosie,</HI> by pulling up Foundations.</P>
<P>Nor will all the History which I shall Trace in the pursuit of this Affair, Illustrate it more than the very Story of <HI>the Ʋnion it self;</HI> The strange Opposition made to the Treaty, and to the Parliament in <HI>Scotland,</HI> against all manner of Reasoning, against Nature, against Interest, the Aversion to it among those very People that are now made Happy by it, with what Convulsions this evil Spirit was cast out, what Struggles it made at parting, how the poor Enslaved People fought against their approaching Freedom, Insulted the Pa∣triots of their Liberty, and with inexpressible Uneasiness, received
<PB N="3" REF="36"/>
the Blessing of Universal Peace. These things, I say, will be lasting Testimonies to that Original Aversion that was planted in the Minds of the People, notwithstanding the Nearness of their Cir∣cumstances in other Cases.</P>
<P>I shall not go back to the Wars here, between the <HI>Scots</HI> and <HI>Picts,</HI> and the <HI>Britains,</HI> in the Time of the <HI>Romans,</HI> and how afterwards in the declining of their Empire, the <HI>Britains fatally to them,</HI> called in the <HI>Saxons</HI> to support them against the Fury of the <HI>Scots;</HI> The Famous <HI>Picts</HI> Wall built in the Time of the <HI>Romans,</HI> the Remains whereof are visible to this day, are sad Tokens of the Ancient Quarrels, Wars, and Devastations that were carried on between the two Kingdoms, even beyond our Accounts of Time.</P>
<P>Nor does it appear to me, That there was in all those Times, any Propensity between the Nations to such a thing as Peace, no not for many Ages after those Times, but if either Side found it convenient to Treat, even those Treaties were carried on with a kind of a professed Resolution of renew'd War on the first occasion; and I think History gives us no Account of any firm resolv'd Peace ever made among them, but only short Truces of Peace for a Term of Years, very often for One year, Two or Three, at the end of which, the War was supposed to break out again of course.</P>
<P>Nor were these Wars carried on like the Wars between other Nations, with Policy, Temper, and Points of Honour, but all that could be expected, when two Terrible and War-like Nations, pro∣voked to all possible Extreams, shall meet, have been to be found here—; These unhappy Wars have therefore been all Devasta∣tion and Blood, the Invasions on either Side have always been Fire and Death, the Land laid waste with Burnings and Plunder, and then the Armies Fighting with Fury and Desperation, no Nations that ever Fought, <HI>since what we are told of in the old Eastern and</HI> Roman <HI>Empires,</HI> have killed so many in Fight; And if I should enter into proportions of Land &amp; People, I need not make Exceptions for them either, Sixty Thousand, Thirty Thousand, Twenty and Fifteen Thousand slain of a Side, have been the frequent Numbers, of which History gives Account in the Wars between these two miserable Nations, and that not seldom, but very often, and some very lately.</P>
<P>I forbear to enter into a further Description of the ancient Feuds of these Nations, as what is but a Melancholly Retrospect, to any that have but common Compassion for their Countrey; this may serve to Illustrate the present Subject, and make the Peace we now enjoy, the more valuable to Posterity.</P>
<P>The first Entrance I shall make on the Matter of Coalition seems to begin with <HI>Edward</HI> the first King of <HI>England,</HI> and this as it was on a wrong Foot, so its Continuance was accordingly—; That Victorious Monarch possest the whole Island of <HI>Britain,</HI> for he pierced <HI>Scotland</HI> to the <HI>Orcades,</HI> and Traversed all the Mountains of <HI>Wales,</HI> subdued all the petty Princes of the <HI>Britains,</HI> and had projected to call himself King of <HI>Britain.</HI></P>

But Providence had better Things in Store for this Island, his projected Empire, Founded on Conquest, Ended ere it began, all his Victories were Unravelled in his Effeminate Luxuriant Son, and he that had Torn the Crown from his Neighbours, had in his Posterity his own Crown laid at the Foot of Justice, and taken from the Heads of a Thoughtless young Tyrant his Son, whose Life was made to pay for the Oppressions of his own Subjects.</P>
<P>It was in this Kings Reign, the first Project of Uniting the two Kingdoms was laid, and tho' it proved Abortive in its most Early Execution, yet it is very useful to the present purpose, and to the Readers Information, to give the World a Scheme of this designed Union, and to let those Gentlemen who have Opposed it now as a Novelty, know, that it was the Opinion of both the Nations in all Ages, for this was in 1386, that a Union would be for the ge∣neral Good of the whole—; See English <HI>Buchan. Fol.</HI> 245.</P>
<P>'Tis true, we find one of the Kings of <HI>Scotland,</HI> viz. <HI>Robert Bruce,</HI> who was really one of the Greatest Kings <HI>Scotland</HI> ever had, among the Instructions left for the Conduct of his Successor, leaving this stated Rule, <HI>viz.</HI> Never to make a perpetual Amity with the <HI>English, Buchan. Lib.</HI> 8. <HI>Fol.</HI> 86.</P>
<P>But the Reasons given for it, will not at all be brought in pre∣judice of a Union, or Incorporation of the two Nations, for as to long Recesses which that Prince argued, to prove, that the <HI>Scots</HI> by Disuse would be rendred unfit for Arms, and so be the more easily worsted by the <HI>English,</HI> who by Foreign Wars were always kept Active and Vigorous, and by that means were likely to have Ad∣vantages of them; that can be no Argument, the Nations now ha∣ving no more occasion for that Emulation.</P>
<P>Nor does it seem to me but the same principle of Care for his Na∣tive Countrey, which led King <HI>Robert</HI> to be so Thoughtful for Time to come, <HI>Could he have seen what these Ages have been brought to know,</HI> would by the same Reasoning, have led him vigorously to have pursued a Conjunction of the two Kingdoms, into one Incor∣porated Body; If he had seen the least Prospect of such an Attempt, being Feasible: and I believe this not from the Nature of the Thing only, and its Correspondence with his General Interest—; But from this Note, That in his Successors Times—, when the first proper Season seemed to offer, it was not Thought of on∣ly, but pursued with all possible Diligence, as shall appear in its proper place.</P>
<P>But to go back to the State of the Wars in his Reign, and a little before.</P>
<P>Who ever will give himself leave to Read the History of the Wars at that Time, will wonder how <HI>Scotland</HI> was able to Struggle with such Terrible Losses, and may reckon up above 200000 <HI>Scots∣men</HI> slain in Fight, only against King <HI>Edward</HI> the first, besides all the other Havock, five several Invasions of a Conquering Enemy, must be attended with.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="38"/>
And yet with what Vigour they shook off the Yoke, how they were to his Death, I mean King <HI>Edward</HI> the first, preparing new Armies, and in the space of but two years after it, ventured a Battle with his Son <HI>Edward</HI> the second, at the Head of 100000 <HI>Englishmen</HI> at <HI>Bannockburn,</HI> and beat him out of the Field with the greatest Slaughter that was ever made in <HI>Britain,</HI> since the Fight between <HI>William</HI> the Conqueror and King <HI>Harold,</HI> there being, as some Histories say, 60000 Men slain on the <HI>English</HI> Side.</P>
<P>Thus ended the Union of Conquest between the Nations, <HI>Scot∣land</HI> recovered her Liberty, and <HI>England</HI> paid very dear for the Experiment.</P>
<P>But this is not the Reason why I begin at this Period, but as the first Sense of the Blessings of Union began to touch the People of this Age, it can not but be acknowledged the great, and in∣deed the only Point of Time, to take the Rise of this Voluminous Story from.</P>
<P><HI>Alexander</HI> the Third King of <HI>Scotland,</HI> was one of the greatest Instances of the Vicissitudes and precarious Condition of a Royal State in the World, in the space of about three Years, he had two Wives, and a flourishing Off-spring, was left first a Widower, then Childless, and at last Lifeless, and the Crown of <HI>Scotland</HI> in a man∣ner Hopeless.</P>
<P><HI>Henry</HI> the Second King of <HI>England</HI> Dying, King <HI>Alexander</HI> and his Queen takes a Journey to <HI>England,</HI> in Complement to King <HI>Edward</HI> the First, and to be present at his Coronation; I shall avoid Dis∣puting here any thing of the so much controverted Article of Homage, let it be how it will, 'tis not to the present purpose, to me it seems not at all the Business of that Journey, if it had, there had been no need of the Queens going too, nor do I Read of any Thing but a Visit of Complement, or a Journey of Curiosity, to see the Pomp and Grandeur of the <HI>English</HI> Court, which was then very great.</P>
<P>In this Journey, Fatal to the Family as well as to <HI>Scotland,</HI> the Queen Sickned, and soon after Dyed; She was followed in a few Months by both her Sons, <HI>David</HI> and <HI>Alexander,</HI> the latter being but just Married to the Daughter of <HI>Baldwin</HI> Earl of <HI>Flanders.</HI></P>
<P>Nor was this all, Disasters seldom come alone, <HI>Margaret</HI> the Kings only Daughter Married to the King of <HI>Norway,</HI> Dyed the same year, leaving one Daughter only, Named also <HI>Margaret;</HI> Of whom presently.</P>
<P>The King surprized with this general Shock of Mortality upon his Family, finding himself Childless, and Unmarried, <HI>but being in his Prime of Age and Strength,</HI> Resolves upon Marriage to Restore his Family, and accordingly he Marries <HI>Joletta</HI> Daughter of the Earl of <HI>Dreux</HI> in <HI>Normandy.</HI></P>
<P>But Heaven had yet further Judgments for <HI>Scotland,</HI> for before any Children were born of this Marriage, the King himself fell from his Horse, and his Kingdom, both at once, for he Broke his
<PB N="6" REF="39"/>
Neck in the Fall at or near <HI>Kinghorn,</HI> a little Town in <HI>Fife,</HI> on the North-side of the Firth over against <HI>Edinburgh.</HI></P>
<P>The only Heir to the Crown, was now <HI>Margaret</HI> Daughter of <HI>Hangonanus</HI> King of <HI>Norway,</HI> by <HI>Margaret</HI> aforesaid, the only Daugh∣ter of <HI>Alexander</HI> the Third King of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>And here is the first Demonstration of what I shall all along in∣sist on in this History, <HI>viz.</HI> That never any rational Prospect of Uniting these Kingdoms appeared in the World, but both the Na∣tions unanimously agreed, that Union was for the mutual Advan∣tage of both, and that it never was Opposed by either Nation, <HI>as a Nation,</HI> but only as Private Interest, Strength of Parties, Court Intrigues, and the Enemies of both the Nations have prevailed, to prevent their Happiness.</P>
<P><HI>Alexander</HI> Dyed in the year 1285, without Issue, Vid. <HI>Buchan. De Rerum</HI> Scoticarum <HI>Lib.</HI> 7. <HI>Fol.</HI> 71. <HI>Edward</HI> the First King of <HI>England,</HI> a Powerful and Politick Prince, saw himself in a Con∣dition to Manage <HI>Scotland</HI> by Force, as afterwards too sadly ap∣peared, but a better Prospect at that Time being in View, he falls immediately upon a Scheme, which, if Providence had permitted it to have taken Effect, would have secured the Peace of these Kingdoms from that Time, and prevented the terrible Effusion of Blood, which happened that very same Age, as well as for many Ages since between both Kingdoms.</P>
<P>And this Project was UNION, the King had one Son <HI>Edward,</HI> Heir to the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> who afterwards proved the most Unfortunate Prince that ever Reigned in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The Crown of <HI>Scotland</HI> had but one Heir, <HI>viz. Margaret</HI> of <HI>Nor∣way,</HI> Grandchild to <HI>Alexander</HI> the Third, by <HI>Margaret</HI> his Daugh∣ter Married to the King of <HI>Norway.</HI> It presently Occurs to the King and his Council, That a Marriage between <HI>Edward</HI> his Son and this young Lady <HI>Margaret,</HI> then commonly called, <HI>The Maid of Nor∣way,</HI> would necessarily Devolve both the Crowns upon his Posteri∣ty, and immediately Establish the Peace of both Kingdoms.</P>
<P>Nor was the Relation very Remote, for <HI>Margaret</HI> was, as above said, the Daughter of <HI>Margaret,</HI> only Daughter of King <HI>Alexander,</HI> by King <HI>Edwards</HI> own Sister; and therefore the Dispensations from the Pope, were then thought necessary to be obtained, as will ap∣pear presently.</P>
<P>Upon the Death of King <HI>Alexander,</HI> says <HI>Buchanan</HI> in the 8<HI>th.</HI> Book of his History, <HI>a Convention of the Estates was held at</HI> Scoon, <HI>to Treat about Creating a new King.</HI> These are <HI>Buchanans</HI> Words; <HI>Alexandro cum tota stirpe (praeter unam ex filia Neptem) Extincto, Conventus Ordinum</HI> Sconam <HI>indicitur, in quo de novo Rege Creando &amp; statu Regni interim Componendo ageretur.</HI> Buch. Lib. 8. Fol. 72.</P>
<P>I confess, considering the Character and Authority of <HI>Buchanan,</HI> I much wonder how he could say, They Met about <HI>Creating a new King,</HI> when in the same Paragraph, he says, <HI>The whole Linage of</HI> Alexander, <HI>except one Grandchild by his Daughter,</HI> being Extinct—; Now if one Grandchild was in Being, the Convention of Estates could not be Met to Create a new King.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="40"/>
Nor does it appear that their Business was to Create a new King, but to Settle the Government of the Kingdom in such Hands, as might secure the publick Peace, during the Absence of their young Queen, and till she could Arrive from <HI>Norway</HI>—; And that this was their Business, is also evident from <HI>Buchanans</HI> own Relation, in the same Chapter Quoted above, where he says, That when most of the Nobility were come to the said Convention, in the First place, they appointed Vicegerents to Govern Matters, <HI>Eo cum Fre∣quens Nobilitas Venisset, primum Omnium Sex Creant, qui summae Re∣ram praeessent,</HI> Buch. Lib. 8. Fol. 72. for the present, That is, till their Queen should Arrive.</P>
<P>To this Assembly <HI>Edward</HI> the First King of <HI>England,</HI> sends his Ambassadors to Treat with them, to desire their Queen, <HI>says Bu∣chanan,</HI> as a Wife to his Son.</P>
<P>The Historical part of this Affair, is not so significant to the pre∣sent purpose, as the Substance and Insention, the Opinion and No∣tion the Nobility, Princes and People of both Nations had of the Thing they were then doing, in which it will appear,<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That an intire Incorporation of Countries, a Coalition of Interests and Affection, as well as Commerce and Constitution, was Designed, even at that distance of Time, as the only Means to Settle the Peace and Happiness of both Nations.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That it was the best Juncture that ever had happened, or could happen for such a Coalition, and nothing but the imme∣diate Hand of Providence, who reserv'd it for a more happy Time, and for more happy Instruments to Finish, could have prevented.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>And therefore <HI>Buchanan</HI> says of it, <HI>Hi, cum in Conventu publico Multa de Ʋtilitate publica, quae hoc Matrimonium esset secatura, Dis∣seruissent,</HI> Scotorum <HI>animos ab ea Affinitate non alienos Invenerunt. Erat enim</HI> Edwardus <HI>Vir Magni animi, Magnaeque Potentiae: Majoris etiam Cupidus: Ejusque virtus, Patre Vivo, in Bello Sacro, &amp; Mortuo, in subigenda Vallia, Enituerat. Neque</HI> Scotorum <HI>nomen unquam Anglo Conjunctius fuisse, Meminerant; quam sub postremis Regibus, nec Odia vetusta, unquam Commodius aboleri posse videbantur, quam si uterque populus honestis &amp; aequis Conditionibus, in unum Coiret.</HI> Buch. de Rer. Scot. Lib. 8. Fol. 72. Which his homely Translator has <HI>Englished</HI> thus;<Q>The Ambassadors in this Session, Discoursed much of the publick Utility like to accrue to both Kingdoms by this Mar∣riage, neither did they find the <HI>Scots</HI> Averse therefrom, for <HI>Ed∣ward</HI> was a Man of great Courage and Power, yet he desired to increase it; and his Valour highly appeared in the Holy War, in his Fathers Lifetime, and after his Death in his subduing of <HI>Wales,</HI> neither were there ever more Endearments past between the <HI>Scots</HI> and the <HI>English</HI> than under the last Kings; yea the
<PB N="8" REF="41"/>
ancient Hatred seemed no way more likely to be Abolished, than if both Nations on just and equal Terms might be United into one.</Q></P>
<P>Here is the very substance of the Queens late Letter to the Par∣liament of <HI>Scotland,</HI> about the Union now made; only here, the People unhappily seem'd Blind to their own Happiness, and so long ago they were able to see it their mutual Interest.</P>
<P>The Ambassadors Discoursed with the Nobility in the Conven∣tion, about the publick Utility like to accrue to both Kingdoms.</P>
<P>What is this but mutual Stipulations, Regulations, and in short, a Treaty between them how to make a Union between the Nations, such as might be for the publick Advantage of both King∣doms.</P>
<P>And this was done with General Endearments between the Kingdoms, mutual Civilities passed between the Gentlemen con∣cerned on both Sides, for the Good of both; we read of no Jea∣lousies, no Prejudices, no radicated Antipathies, but the publick Good convinced both Sides, that nothing could Contribute more to the Rooting out and Abolishing the ancient Hatred, than to have both Nations on just and equal Terms be UNITED INTO ONE.</P>
<P>Nor is it remote to this purpose, to enter a little into the Ar∣ticles of this Union, for tho' History is very silent in this Matter, yet, as I have promised to search every Thing in this History to the Bottom, I find among the Records in the Tower of <HI>London,</HI> an Ancient Instrument or Form of this Union or Confederacy, which in the <HI>Appendix</HI> to this Work, you will have Printed at large, and is Numbred 1.</P>
<P>And <HI>First,</HI> to let the World be satisfied, that even in so remote a Time, things of this nature were Transacted with the same due Caution and Regard to the Liberties and Good of the People, as they are now, and that it was a National not a private Act, not an Act of a few, Over-awed by the Power of King <HI>Edward,</HI> tho' seve∣ral Steps taken in it, will be very necessary to be Noted, for I take this to be the most exact Pattern of the present Treaty, of any that has ever gone before it, as it was a Treaty seriously set about by both Nations, with a real Design for the general Utility, and with a Design on both Sides to bring it to pass, which is more than can be said of all the Treaties which have been set on Foot since.</P>
<P>The first Step the King took after his sending Ambassadors to Treat with the Convention, seems to me to be the obtaining a Dispensation from the Pope; the Queen and the young Prince being nearly Allyed; and such was the subjection of the Princes of the World to the <HI>Roman</HI> Tyranny, that nothing could go on of this Nature, without the Sanction of the Church, where, by the way may be observed;</P>
<P>That the Pope, as in all Ages Popes have done, made his Ad∣vantage of the Occasion, and takes this Opportunity, to Demand of the King an old Arrear of an annual Pension of 1000 Merks,
<PB N="9" REF="42"/>
Granted by King <HI>John</HI> to the Holy See, and which King <HI>Edward</HI> had lest five years unpaid.</P>
<P>The King, who knew well enough the Influence ready Money had in such Cases, readily answers the Popes Demands, and Issued his Writ for payment of the Money.</P>
<P>The true Copy of the Original Warrant to the Treasurer, is added in the <HI>Appendix</HI> to this Work, which being very short, I thought not Improper to insert there, as a Thing the Curious may be very well pleased to Read, and is marked N<SUP>o.</SUP> (8.)</P>
<P>It is to be Noted the End of King <HI>Edward</HI> in payment of this Money, was plainly to get the Dispensation Expedited, for he never paid any more that I read of, nor his Successors either, I mean, on account of that old Pension or Grant of King <HI>John's.</HI></P>
<P>His Holiness was so exceedingly obliged by this payment of 5000 Merks, that he immediately dispatched the Dispensation for the Marriage of Prince <HI>Edward,</HI> with the Heiress of the Crown of <HI>Scot∣land,</HI> tho' within the prohibited Degrees of Consanguinity; which Dispensation is Enrolled in the patent Roll of 17. <HI>Ed.</HI> 1st. and may be found in the <HI>Appendix</HI> to this Work, N<SUP>o</SUP> 2.</P>
<P>The next Step the King takes is, to send Ambassadors and Letters to the King of <HI>Norway,</HI> giving his Proxie to the Bishop of <HI>Durham,</HI> one of the said Ambassadors, to Espouse the Lady in the Name of his Son <HI>Edward,</HI> wherein the Dispensation obtained from the Pope, is Repeated; This Letter and Proxie is added in the <HI>Appendix,</HI> N<SUP>o.</SUP> 3.</P>
<P>At the same Time he sends Letters to the Keepers or Guardians of the Realm of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and to the King of <HI>Norway</HI> in Answer to Letters received from them, containing all the Articles and Agree∣ments on which it was that he proposed this Marriage, which were Published by the King, for the Satisfaction of the Subjects of both Nations, in which you will find all possible Care taken of the Ge∣neral Good, and sincere Protestations, that the End of this Mar∣riage, was, as is expressed in one of the Letters, <HI>Ad Honorem Dei &amp; Tranquilitatem Totius Communitatis ejusdem Regni.</HI></P>
<P>These Testimonials are too significant not to deserve a Place in this History, and therefore are placed in their Order in the Col∣lection, and Numbred 4, 5, 6, 7.</P>
<P>Nor was this all, but I find a large Charter or Grant made by the Agreement of special Commissioners on both Sides, and Rati∣fied by the King himself, to the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>In short, it is a meer Treaty of Union between the Kingdoms, tho' not much Collateral, but rather particularly to <HI>Scotland,</HI> this has the Great Seal affixed to it, and the King took an Oath to ob∣serve it, under the Penalty of One Hundred Thousand Pounds <HI>Sterling, an immense Sum in those days,</HI> to be paid to the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> towards carrying on the Wars in the Holy Land, and on the farther Penalty of Excommunication, and subjecting his whole Kingdom to an Interdict; Things very Terrible in those Days.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="43"/>
This Instrument also is at large found among the Records in the Tower of <HI>London,</HI> and is Re-printed in <HI>Prynnes</HI> Collection <HI>Fol.</HI> 395. 396, 397. and added in the <HI>Appendix</HI> or <HI>Collection</HI> to this Work, N<SUP>o</SUP> 9.</P>
<P>Another Instrument is also Recorded in old <HI>French,</HI> wherein the Security to <HI>Scotland,</HI> for Surrendring her Forts and Strengths to the <HI>English</HI> on this Marriage, is Settled, and which you will find in the <HI>Collection</HI> also, N<SUP>o.</SUP> 10.</P>
<P>Thus the Affair of an Union was finished above Four Hundred and Twenty Years ago, and these Nations had Flourished under its Consequences no doubt—; But Heaven Frown'd on so great a Work, and the Sins of both Nations permitted not that Blessing to come in their Day; for the Lady Dyed in her Voyage from <HI>Norway</HI> to <HI>Scotland,</HI> having a Rough Passage, and being not able to bear the Fatigues of the Sea; And thus all this fair Fabrick came to nothing, was Dash'd in a Moment, to the inexpressible Loss and Regret of both the Nations.</P>
<P><HI>Buchanan</HI> says, She Dyed in <HI>Norway</HI> before the Commissioners Arrived, but our <HI>English</HI> Historians, &amp; Mr. <HI>Tyrrel</HI> in particular, whom in this I follow, <HI>Lib.</HI> 9. <HI>Vol.</HI> 3. <HI>Fol.</HI> 6. says positively, she Dyed in Her Voyage between <HI>Norway</HI> and <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>I cannot omit to Re-mind the Reader of these Sheets, what were the Dismal Consequences of this Disappointment to both these Kingdoms, and as it was nothing but the immediate Hand of Pro∣vidence that brought it to pass, so it may, without any Charge of <HI>Enthusiasm,</HI> or Over-straining the Case, be allowed, to be one of the severest Judgments that ever Heaven Inflicted on this Island.</P>
<P>And I insist on this, not so much as it relates to the present History, but as it may be needful for such People to Reflect upon, who have, <HI>at the same Time that they pretended to be Lovers of their Coun∣trey,</HI> yet vigorously Opposed the Uniting these Nations in this last Treaty.</P>
<P>The breaking of the happy Prospect of Union between the two Kingdoms, was attended with strange Confusions, all which serve to Enhance the Value of their present United State, the hopes of a prosperous Peace were not greater on one Hand, than the prospect of Dismal Confusions was Horrid on the other; And tho' it be a Digression, I shall venture the Trespass to give a short Abridgement of the History of those Times, as in the Course of these Sheets it shall be needful to Form a due Connexion, and I promise my self, the Diversion will be as pleasant as profitable, and that no body will think it lost Labour to Read over, what in those Ages was Transacted on the Stage of their Native Countrey.</P>
<P>With the Death of this Princess, all the Thoughts of Union be∣tween the Kingdoms Dyed also, each Party began to Examine their separate Interests, not Consulting what was fit to be done for the carrying on their National and General Advantages.</P>
<P>The Business of <HI>Scotland</HI> was, how to Settle the Crown, and who to Declare King, the Conservators or Keepers of the Kingdom, ap∣pointed
<PB N="11" REF="44"/>
by the Convention of the Estates Assembled at <HI>Scoon,</HI> were according to <HI>Buchanan, Duncan Macduff</HI> Earl of <HI>Fife, John Cumin</HI> Earl of <HI>Buchan, William Frazer</HI> Arch-bishop of St. <HI>Andrews, Robert</HI> Bishop of <HI>Glasgow,</HI> another <HI>John Cumin,</HI> and one <HI>John Steuart.</HI></P>
<P>The principal Pretenders to the Crown, were, <HI>John Baliol</HI> and <HI>Robert Bruce,</HI> their Descent, and the Foundation of their Claim, is at large to be found in <HI>Buchanans</HI> History <HI>Lib.</HI> 8. their Titles were remote, and not only pretty equally founded, but their Interest among the Nobility was so equal, and either way so powerful, that nothing but an immediate and Bloody War was apprehended, as the Consequence of their Pretensions.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>England</HI> disappointed in his Hopes of bringing the Kingdoms to a lasting Peace, by Uniting them into one, as before, applyed himself no more to Consult their General Good.</P>
<P>But considering them in their separate Capacity, as two Nations that could not long Agree, made it his whole Study, either first to subject <HI>Scotland</HI> to <HI>England,</HI> so as that making her Dependent on <HI>England,</HI> she should not be able to Break with him; or so to di∣vide the <HI>Scots</HI> among themselves, as that they should be in no Con∣dition to Hurt him.</P>
<P>Both his Ends seemed easie to Answer in the Occasion that now offered it self; for the <HI>Scots</HI> Nobility being, <HI>as I have Noted,</HI> so equally divided in the Interests of <HI>Baliol</HI> and <HI>Bruce,</HI> that they knew not what Course to take, they resolved, in order to avoid the Confusions of a War, and consequently the Ruin of their Countrey, to refer it to the Arbitriment of the King of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>This was a full Testimony of the Harmony and good Under∣standing which was then between the Nations, and what a happy Juncture it had been for a Union, if Heaven had thought fit to bless the Design with Success, any body may observe; for the King of <HI>England</HI> was looked upon as such a Disinterested Friend to <HI>Scot∣land,</HI> and one that would willingly concern himself for their Good, that they leave the Determination of the weightiest Thing in the World, <HI>to their Nation,</HI> wholly to his Sentence.</P>
<P>But I can not say the King Acted with equal Candor to the <HI>Scots,</HI> if what the Histories of those Times say, may be depended upon; For being a politick Prince, and having a long View of the Effects of Things before him, he resolved to keep his Eye upon the two Particulars Noted above, in his Determining this Affair, and rather to regard his own Interest than the Good of <HI>Scotland,</HI> or than the Justice of the Claim; he resolved to Sound the Inclinations of the two Canditates for the Crown, and so to give the Kingdom to him, that would conform himself most to his Measures.</P>
<P>Upon this he Treats first with the Nobility, and appoints a Meet∣ing at <HI>Berwick,</HI> then he Exacts an Oath of the Competitors, to stand intirely to and be Determined by his Award; Then he orders a Select Number out of the Nobility of each Nation, as a Council in this Case, Twelve of a Side, Mr. <HI>Tyrrel</HI> says, Fourty of a Side, and
<PB N="12" REF="45"/>
Exacts an Oath of them, to Advise, Judge, and Determine Rightly and Truly according to their Consciences.</P>
<P>These were the Politick Appearances of his Management, the better to cover his true Design; for all this while he causes the two Competitors to be Sounded Under-hand, to find out which was most likely to Comply with his Demands.</P>
<P>At last, the publick Debates beginning to draw near a Period, it was easie to see, That <HI>Baliols</HI> Title was like to be Approved by the Twenty Four, as the best Claim, and that <HI>Bruce</HI> would lose it, this the King thought, was the Juncture to put it home in, and there∣fore causes it to be proposed to <HI>Bruce,</HI> That tho' it was plain he would lose the Crown, yet if he would subject himself and the Crown, to the Authority of the King of <HI>England,</HI> he should be im∣mediately Declared.</P>
<P>All Men must Allow it was Politickly Managed, <HI>but all the Craft of Hell is lost upon an honest Man, Bruce</HI> like a Man of Honour, Re∣jects the Proposal with Contempt, and told them that proposed it, That <HI>he scorned to enjoy the Crown at the Price of his Countries Bondage.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Baliol,</HI> whose Principle was worse, tho' his Title was better, Ac∣cepts the base Conditions, and obtains the Crown, Swears Fealty to the King of <HI>Kngland,</HI> and makes all the Nobility that were in his Interest, do the same.</P>
<P>All our Historians do not agree in this Account, and Mr. <HI>Tyrrel,</HI> who is very particular in relating the Proceedings, <HI>Vol.</HI> 3. <HI>Lib.</HI> 9. <HI>Fol.</HI> 70, 71, 72. takes no Notice of this, but others, and parti∣cularly <HI>Buchanan</HI> being very positive, <HI>Lib.</HI> 8. <HI>Fol.</HI> 24. I put it down as Fact, giving my Authors Authority for it, and leave the Reader to believe as much as he thinks fit of the Fact, the Subject I am upon, not depending upon it at all.</P>
<P>But he that basely yields to a Dishonest Yoke, in order to Gratifie his Ambition, is much more likely to break the Conditions he makes, than he that adheres to Honourable Articles, and insists on what Justice gives him a Claim to, and thus it was here, for on the first Affront offered to <HI>Baliol</HI> by the <HI>English,</HI> in consequence of his Subjection, he threw off the Yoke, and Renounced that Subjection; The Case in short was as follows.</P>
<P><HI>Macduff</HI> Earl of <HI>Fife</HI> being Injured, as he conceives, in a Suit Depending between him and the <HI>Abernethians,</HI> for the Murder of his elder Brother, <HI>The King having Determined in Favour of the Murde∣rers,</HI> Appeals to the King of <HI>England</HI> against <HI>Baliol</HI>—; When the Cause came to be heard, <HI>John Baliol</HI> was then at the <HI>English</HI> Court, and being present when he was Called to Answer, offers to Plead by a Proxy, <HI>or as we say,</HI> to be heard by his Council, but was refused, and obliged to come down, and stand at the Bar like a Criminal, and plead for himself.</P>
<P>This broke off all his Subjection, fills him with Indignation; and from this Time, he Studies nothing but Revenge; an Opportunity soon offered to his Mind, for a War breaking out between the <HI>English</HI>
<PB N="13" REF="46"/>
and the <HI>French,</HI> and both Soliciting <HI>Scotland</HI> for Aid, the Estates of <HI>Scotland</HI> Determine, <HI>Tho' in an ill Hour for Scotland,</HI> to Assist the <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P>Thus all the good Temper of both Nations one towards another Vanished at once, and the most Bloody Wars that ever this Island felt, happened between them.</P>
<P><HI>Baliol</HI> by a solemn Embassy, Renounces his Submission to <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> as Extorted by unjust Methods, and his Friendship also—; And <HI>Edward</HI> in Return, furiously Invades <HI>Scotland</HI> both by Sea and Land.</P>
<P>'Tis not at all my Design, nor to my Purpose, to enter here in∣to the History of these Wars, or the Battels, Ravages, Fire and Blood, which the two Nations felt during the whole Reign of the three <HI>Edwards</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> with but small Intermissions; the par∣ticulars whereof would of themselves make a large Volume—; The true Reason of my mentioning these Things, will appear in my further prosecuting this Story: The short Use of it is this, That these two unhappy Nations were always in Extremes with one another; Nothing but the <HI>closest Ʋnion,</HI> or the most destructive <HI>War,</HI> can be the State they must live in together; And this I shall but too often make evident in these Sheets.</P>
<P>From this Breach, the War between the Nations came to a strange height, <HI>Edward</HI> proved Victorious over the <HI>Scots,</HI> and the Conse∣quences of that are easie to Guess, <HI>Baliol</HI> was Crusht, his Armies Overthrown, the Countrey Pierc't, even to the Extremest part by the <HI>English.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Edward</HI> calls <HI>Bruce</HI> to his Side, <HI>Baliol</HI> is taken Prisoner and Sur∣renders the Kingdom, then the Famous <HI>Wallace</HI> gets up, and carries on the War on the Subject of meer National Liberty, Overthrows the <HI>English</HI> in several Encounters, and is made Regent: But is again Overthrown by <HI>Edward</HI> and <HI>Bruce</HI> at the great Battel of <HI>Falkirk,</HI> and <HI>Scotland</HI> then intirely submits to <HI>Edward,</HI> whose Tyrannical Government makes the very <HI>Scots</HI> who had taken part with him against <HI>Baliol,</HI> Conspire together to Recover their Liberty, and one <HI>Cuming</HI> Leaguing with <HI>Robert Bruce,</HI> Son to that <HI>Bruce</HI> who was to have been King; These, tho' Enemies before, joyn together to free their Countrey. But <HI>Cuming</HI> designing to Betray <HI>Bruce,</HI> is Killed by him with his own Hands in the very Church at <HI>Drum∣fries.</HI></P>
<P>How <HI>Bruce</HI> after this Recovered the Kingdom from that Subjecti∣on to the <HI>English;</HI> How he was often Overthrown by <HI>Edward,</HI> and several times reduced to hide himself in the Mountains, and most secret Places of the Kingdom, and sometimes so long, that he was supposed to be Dead;—How yet at last by innumerable Attempts, Unwearied Pains, and Invincible Courage he retrived his Fortune, Drove the <HI>English</HI> out of his Countrey, Overthrew them with a terrible Slaughter at <HI>Bannockburn</HI> near <HI>Stirling,</HI> and after a Reign of Twenty Four Years full of continual War, against the most power∣ful Princes <HI>England</HI> had in these Ages of the World; he Died in
<PB N="14" REF="47"/>
Peace, his Countrey being Recovered out of their Hands; These Things would be too long a Story here to relate.</P>
<P>In this War, by the best Calculations I can make, of Armies Raised, and Battels Fought, no less than Six Hundered Thousand People of both Nations perished, and all for want of that happy UNION, so near perfected, and so disastruously lost. A good Looking-glass for those Gentlemen <HI>(who have openly wished these Nations might make a Breach either on one Side or another)</HI> to look into, and for them to see, <HI>if their Designs had</HI> succeeded, what their Posterity might have had cause to Thank them for.</P>
<P><HI>If it be Objected,</HI> that it does not follow, That on a Breach of this last Treaty <HI>of Ʋnion,</HI> a War must necessarily have happened, I shall take the Liberty to enter upon that Head by it self, and believe these Sheets will prove, That a War must have been the inevitable Consequence of breaking up this last Treaty, especially if broken up according to the Project of those People that appeared to Op∣pose it, who, we all know, acted on Principles, both as to Trade, Civil Government, and Succession, Incompatible with the Interest of both the present Establishments, and as much as can be said perfectly impracticable, as the Kingdoms were thus Constituted; But of this more hereafter.</P>
<P>From this Time, we meet with no Overtures of settled Tran∣quillity between the Kingdoms, till the Days of <HI>Henry</HI> VII. of <HI>England,</HI> whose Daughter <HI>Margaret</HI> was Married to <HI>James</HI> IV. King of <HI>Scotland</HI>—; And tho' this Marriage was the Mother of Uni∣on (as I may Term it) and laid the Foundation of almost all the Projects that have happened since, and from whence at last the Crown of <HI>England</HI> Devolved upon the Royal Line of <HI>Scotland,</HI> yet in his Time there were no immediate Steps taken towards it. The outmost Effect of this Marriage, was an immediate Peace between the Nations, which, however, did not last long, but King <HI>James</HI> falling in with the <HI>French</HI> Interest, fell out with his Father-in-law King <HI>Henry</HI> VII. and after with his Brother King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. and lost his Life in that War.</P>
<P>The first Attempt subsequent to this, was a Proposal of <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. who, after this great Quarrel was ended, tho' he was Victor, offered <HI>to Match his Daughter</HI> Mary <HI>(Prince</HI> Edward, <HI>afterwards King</HI> Edward VI. <HI>being then not Born)</HI> to <HI>James</HI> the 5<HI>th.</HI> King of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and to secure the possession of the Crown after himself to them Joyntly; And the design of this Match, <HI>it was evident,</HI> could be nothing else, but a firm, lasting, and established Peace between the two Nations; For having himself no Sons, and expecting none, <HI>(For the business of the Divorce of his Wife Queen</HI> Katharine <HI>was not then come into his Head)</HI> He foresaw this was the only Step to Unite the Nations, and put an End to these Bloody Contentions, that for so many Ages had been between them, for that the Heirs of that Match would by consequence be possest of both, and so the whole Island would become one Happy and most powerful People, United in Interest, in Government, and in every Thing that would make them Great.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="48"/>
This Proposal was so Rational, and so visibly tending to the general Advantage of both Kingdoms, That it could not be sup∣posed to meet with any Opposition from such, as were in the least concerned for the Good of their Native Country on either Hand.</P>
<P><HI>On the</HI> English <HI>Side</HI> it met with an immediate good Reception, for King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII, contrary to the general Conduct of that Prince, whose Temper was (generally speaking) Bloody, Fierce, Haugh∣ty, and too apt to Insult such as fell into his Hands; Yet here, changing his Temper, he caused the <HI>Scots</HI> Prisoners, taken at the late Battel, to be very well Treated, and Committed to the several Keepings of the <HI>English</HI> Nobility, who used them Honourably, and according to their Quality.</P>
<P>I know it is said, That the King, who had this Project first in his Head, distributed the <HI>Scots</HI> Noblemen in the Houses of the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> Lords, That these might, according to his private Instructions, deal with them apart, and strive, by Promises, and such like Ar∣guments, to bring them to hearken to such a Proposal, and to be∣gin the Treaty—; And that the said <HI>Scots</HI> Noblemen were, by this Artifice, prompted, and brought to make the first Offer of this Marriage, as from <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>But let this be as it will, let the Honour of the Proposal ly where it will, it is manifest, both Parties were well pleased with it, and look'd upon it as the best Method, to bring both Nations to a State of Prosperous and Durable Peace. But <HI>Satan hindered.</HI></P>
<P>It was evident, That both Kingdoms had a fixed Inclination, at this time, for the Union: <HI>Henry</HI> shewed his Good Will, in that he offered to heap up unusual Honours upon the King of <HI>Scotland,</HI> upon the first Project of the Match, as upon his undoubted Successor to the Crown, such as making him a Peer of <HI>Britain,</HI> by the Royal Title of Duke of <HI>York,</HI> a Title Vested in the Crown, and since the Father of <HI>Edward</HI> the Fourth, reckoned the next Step to the Throne; But this was not all, he offered to declare him Lord Lieutenant, or Deputy Governour of <HI>England,</HI> immediately upon the Match; This was to put the Government, as it were, in his actual Possession, and make him King by the Consequence of the Thing—; There is no doubt, but, had this Match succeeded, there would have been mutual Stipulations of a compleat Coalition entred into by the respective Parliaments of both Kingdoms.</P>
<P>But <HI>French</HI> and Popish Counsels prevented this Happy Conjuncti∣on, as they have several others since, <HI>and would have done the last;</HI> For the Clergy of <HI>Scotland</HI> finding <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. of <HI>England</HI> had crusht the Power of the Clergy in <HI>England,</HI> and was suppressing the Abbeys and Monasteries, curbing the extended Authority of the Pope, and as they apprehended destroying their Church, they set themselves by all possible Artifice, to prevent this Proposals taking Effect; And getting the <HI>French</HI> King to joyn his Interest with theirs, they wrought the King of <HI>Scotland</HI> to such a Dislike of the Match, That he rejected King <HI>Henry</HI>'s Proposal with some Indecencies, re∣fused him an Interview at <HI>York,</HI> tho' he had given his Word to
<PB N="16" REF="49"/>
meet him there—; This King <HI>Henry</HI> so resented, That a War immediately followed, (as upon a Defeat of an Union has gene∣rally happened) in which War, the <HI>Scots</HI> Nobility were so sensible of the wrong Measures of their Prince, and the Advantages to their Country, which he had rashly rejected, That they followed him very unwillingly, and at last wholly abandoned him at <HI>Solan-Moss,</HI> Declaring, They thought it was not their Duty to ruine their Country, to gratifie the Passion of their Deluded Monarch, and the Blinded Fury of the Clergy: This cost King <HI>James</HI> his Life, who died of Grief, as <HI>Buchanan</HI> relates, <HI>Rerum Scoticarum, Lib.</HI> 7. <HI>Fol.</HI> 76.</P>
<P>Its true, had this Match gone forward, it had not had the de∣signed Effect, at least not immediately, because King <HI>Henry</HI> the VIII. afterwards had a Son born, who succeeded to the Crown <HI>(viz.) Edward</HI> the VI—; But this is not to the present Case, the Design was the same, nor did it die with the respective Kings—; Nay, after the Birth of the Young Prince, King <HI>Henry</HI> the VIII. made a second Proposal of an Union, <HI>viz.</HI> Of a Match between his Son <HI>Edward,</HI> and the Daughter of the late King of <HI>Scots;</HI> And this went so far, as to be Approved in the Parliament of <HI>Scotland,</HI> as may be seen in the Registers of that Time; But this was again interrupted, as the former had been, by the Death of King <HI>Henry</HI> the VIII. who left the Crown to his Son <HI>Edward</HI> the VI.</P>
<P>In this Reign, the Project of Uniting the Kingdoms revived im∣mediately, for the <HI>English</HI> Council saw clearly the Advantages ac∣cruing to both Nations by an Union, and could not slip that Happy Juncture: Their King was a Child not above Nine Years of Age, the Queen of <HI>Scotland</HI> was the like, left by her Father at Five Days old, and Crowned in her Cradle: The Regency of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and the Council of Governours of the Young King, revive the Treaty, and propose a Match between the King of <HI>England</HI> and the Queen of <HI>Scotland</HI>—, and built it upon the late Agreement made be∣tween King <HI>Henry</HI> and the Parliament of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>But the <HI>French</HI> and Popish Party, who, as I have noted already, opposed Uniting the Kingdoms before, on the pretence of the Dan∣ger of the <HI>Roman</HI> Church, had now much more Reason to do so; Since King <HI>Edward</HI> had declared himself, <HI>as they esteemed it,</HI> an Heretick, had disowned the Pope, and had erected a Protestant Church on the Ruine of the <HI>Romish;</HI> And on these Arguments they rejected the Proposal, and broke their former Agreement.</P>
<P>And here happened, <HI>what I have all along observed to be the Conse∣quence of breaking up a Treaty between the Two Nations, viz.</HI> A Bloody War, like as certainly must have happened again, had not this last Happy Treaty interveened, of which I am to Discourse, in these Sheets.</P>
<P>It is not my Business to enter upon the Particulars of the War on this Occasion, but two Things it will be necessary to observe, 1<HI>st,</HI> That this War issued in the Defeat of the <HI>Scots</HI> Popish Army at the Battel at <HI>Pinkie,</HI> after which it was expected the Young Queen should have been delivered to the <HI>English,</HI> and Marryed to their King:
<PB N="17" REF="50"/>
And truly, if the Frank and Generous Offer of the Conquerors had been in the least regarded, it had been so, who, after the Victory made no Spoil or Havock in <HI>Scotland,</HI> but, as Friends, made a Fair De∣mand of their <HI>(the Scots)</HI> Queen to be Married to their <HI>(the English)</HI> King, That so the Nations being United, might for ever remain One—; And this is to be seen in that Famous Declaration of the Duke of <HI>Somerset</HI> the <HI>English</HI> General, which, as it is in a Stile peculiar, and not usual in the World among Conquerors, I could not omit, and is in the <HI>Appendix, N<SUP>o</SUP>.</HI> 11.</P>
<P>But, 1. It was in Vain to Talk Reason to a People resolved; The Popish Party, who saw evidently the Ruine of their Church, and the <HI>French,</HI> who saw the Destruction of their Ancient League wrapt up in the projected Union of the Kingdoms, frustrated all the Design, by Conveying the Young Princess into <HI>France;</HI> And so this Scheme came also to nothing.</P>
<P>This had several bad Effects, which <HI>Scotland</HI> afterwards Regret∣ed, <HI>First,</HI> That it delayed the Reformation in <HI>Scotland</HI> for near Thirty Years after that in <HI>England,</HI> and made it both Difficult, Bloody, Tedious, and for a long Time Imperfect, of which I have Treated elsewhere. <HI>Secondly,</HI> It brought her under a <HI>French</HI> Yoke, and for a long Time she Groaned under the Tyranny of <HI>French</HI> In∣fluence, till the Nation threw off Tyranny and Popery together, and Reformation came on Hand in Hand with Liberty.</P>
<P>And now the Notion of Union between the Two Kingdoms be∣gan to wear out, as a Thing, That, <HI>tho' both Nations had Inclinati∣on enough to engage in,</HI> yet there was no Juncture to make it Feasible, till the Death of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> who dying without Issue, the <HI>English</HI> Crown devolved upon the <HI>Scots</HI> Line; And this produced <HI>a kind of Ʋnion,</HI> I mean an Union of the Crowns, but not an Uni∣on of the Kingdoms; Of the Imperfection, Deficiency and Incon∣veniency of which to both Kingdoms, I shall make some brief Observations, as they have been the Motives to the frequent At∣tempts for a more near Conjunction in the succeeding Times.</P>
<P>The Inconveniencies to <HI>Scotland</HI> in this partial Union were, <HI>First,</HI> Their removing their Court to <HI>England,</HI> their King, accord∣ing to the Prophetick Saying of <HI>Henry</HI> the VII, removing his Seat of Government from the less to the greater—; This was natu∣rally attended with the Decay of Trade in <HI>Scotland,</HI> by removing the Concourse of Strangers from <HI>Scotland,</HI> whose Consumption of Provisions and Manufactures, which are the Foundation of Com∣merce, was a great Loss to Trade—; With the Exporting their ready Money out of the Kingdom, by the constant Attendance of their Gentry and Nobility at the <HI>English</HI> Court, where they spent their Estates, and suck'd out the Blood of their Country, to support their Luxury and Magnificence—; With the continued empty∣ing their Nation of their People, who all flocked to <HI>England,</HI> ei∣ther for publick or private Employment, and Depopulated, as well as Impoverished, their Native Country; <HI>But above all,</HI> the bringing <HI>Scotland</HI> under <HI>English</HI> Influence, both as to Civil and Religious
<PB N="18" REF="51"/>
Government, was a manifest Token of the Deficiency of this partial Union; For <HI>Scotland</HI> was after this, in a Political Sense, tho' not in a Legal Sense, always under the Management of the <HI>English</HI> Court: It had the Subjection without the Advantages—; Her Sea∣men were press'd into the <HI>English</HI> Service as Subjects, yet, at the same time, excluded the Merchants Service as Foreigners, an <HI>English</HI> Ship Sailed with above one Third <HI>Scots</HI> Men would be seized, as not being Sailed by <HI>English</HI> Men, and the Colonies of <HI>England</HI> were at last all barred from them, as much as from the <HI>French</HI> or <HI>Dutch;</HI> It would be too long a Digression, to recite here the various Incon∣veniencies <HI>Scotland</HI> laboured under, from the Deficiency of this partial, or meerly Regal Union, and which made all the Well-Wishers to <HI>Scotland</HI> desire, either that there were a more intire Union, or that there were no Union at all—</P>
<P>Nor was this unforeseen by either Nation, and therefore, no sooner was King <HI>James</HI> the VI. of <HI>Scotland</HI> come to the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> but he began (before he had learn'd quite to forget his own Country) to project a more near Union of the Nations, as the only way to make them both compleatly Happy; This was in the Year 1604—, when, <HI>after several Projects of Ʋniting by his own Absolute Authority, a Thing then newly taken up in the World,</HI> finding all other Methods fail, he proposed it to the Parliament of <HI>England, That,</HI> to use his own Words, <HI>as they were made One in the Head, they might be inseparably Conjoined, and all Memory of past Di∣visions be Extinguished;</HI> At the same time he proposed it in <HI>Scot∣land,</HI> and both Nations were so sensible of the mutual Advantages of Union, That they readily agreed to it, and Commissioners were appointed on both Sides to Treat.

<P>We do not find among our Authors any particular of the Debates of these Commissioners: <HI>Spotswood</HI> in his History <HI>Fol.</HI> 481. gives in a Draught of the Articles they agreed on, which for want of Room I only refer the Reader to, but having obtained from good hands, a Manuscript of Sir <HI>George Mackenzies,</HI> being a little like a Journal of their Proceedings, I could not but think it very much to the purpose, to insert it in the Appendix to this Work, where may be seen the true Ground Plat of the present Union, and the Interest of both Kingdoms, clearly stated—as it stood then, and saving in matters of Religion remains still, see Appendix <HI>N</HI> 12.</P>
<P>These Articles thus mutually agreed, were Engrossed and Signed by the Commissioners on both Sides, and presented to the King the 6<HI>th.</HI> of <HI>December</HI> 1604—; But it was observed. That the Earl of <HI>Salisburry</HI> at the presenting the Draught to the King, expressed it to be the meaning of the Commissioners, That these Articles were but an imperfect Agreement, and that they were willing to finish and go through the same when ever he pleased.</P>
<P>However, the King offered it to the Parliament of <HI>England,</HI> and as <HI>Spotswood</HI> says, Recommended it Earnestly to them; But the more secret History of that Affair, was, That the King himself fal∣ling in at that Time with the <HI>English</HI> Clergy, and Opposing the Pros∣perity of his own Countrey, upon the Score of Religion and abso∣lute Will, found Ways and Means to puzzle this Cause in Parliament; and <HI>First,</HI> The difficulty of the <HI>Post-Nati, a Thing, which had the</HI> Eng∣lish <HI>at that Time purposed a Hearty Ʋnion,</HI> would never have stuck with them, occasioned long Struggle, and at last the Parliament referr'd it to the Common Law; While this was doing, the National Aversion, particularly in <HI>England,</HI> seemed to revive, and the pub∣lick
<PB N="20" REF="53"/>
Appearances in <HI>England</HI> of a Spirit of Division, were such, <HI>as one observes,</HI> That very well discover'd the King was become <HI>on English Man,</HI> otherwise he would never have born with those In∣vectives and Railings at <HI>Scotland,</HI> which Sir <HI>Thomas Craig</HI> in his Book <HI>De Ʋnione Regnorum,</HI> says, were then publickly used in the Pulpits and in Printed Books, while their King was a <HI>Scotsman.</HI></P>
<P>Nor was this all, but the King in stead of forwarding the Union of the two Kingdoms, or promoting the particular Advantage of <HI>Scotland,</HI> fell in with the arbitrary Projects of that Time, to make himself Absolute in <HI>Scotland</HI>—, as he was also doing in <HI>England.</HI> This would lead me into a vast Ocean of National Confusions, which received their Rise and Conception in the Tyrannical Tem∣per of this Prince, in which he laid the Foundation of the Ruine of his Posterity, which as remote to my present Business, purposely I Omit.</P>
<P>Asto Union, nothing further was done till the year 1660—, and till that Time, which was about 56 years, the Subjects of <HI>Scot∣land</HI> enjoyed a Freedom of Commerce in Common with the <HI>Eng∣lish,</HI> to all the <HI>English</HI> Colonies; But then some Acts in <HI>England</HI> passing in prejudice of that Freedom of Commerce, the <HI>Scots</HI> re∣newed their Complaints, and a Commission says, Sir <HI>George Mac∣kenzie</HI> was granted in the 3<HI>d.</HI> Session of the first Parliament of <HI>Charles</HI> 2<HI>d.</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and by an Act at the same time in <HI>England,</HI> Nominating Commissioners to Adjust these Differences; This was in 1666.</P>
<P>These Commissioners met the 21<HI>st. January</HI> 1667, and the <HI>Scots</HI> Commissioners gave in a Proposal to the <HI>English,</HI> for settling the Differences about Trade, which Paper I have also given you from an Original Manuscript of the said Sir <HI>George Mackenzie,</HI> and which you will find in the Appendix N<SUP>o.</SUP> 13.</P>
<P>The Debates which followed this Paper, says <HI>Sir George,</HI> served only to shew the King the Necessity of Commencing a further Treaty, <HI>viz.</HI> Of a Union, and how Ineffectual all other Treaties would be to bring about the publick Peace of the two Nations.</P>
<P>To this End, a Parliament being called in <HI>Scotland</HI> the 19<HI>th.</HI> of <HI>October</HI> 1667, and the <HI>English</HI> Parliament meeting the same Day, he caused the great Affair of an Union to be proposed to both at the same time; The Parliament of <HI>Scotland,</HI> by their Letter to the King, expressed their Readiness to concur with the Poposal; And that they would grant Commission to such, as His Majesty should Nominate for that Purpose, to Treat as their Representatives; And left it to the King to Name the Time, Place, and <HI>Quorum</HI> of their Meetings—; This being the Substance of the Letter, I have omitted the Letter it self, which is to be seen in the Registers in <HI>Edinburgh.</HI></P>
<P>The Parliament of <HI>England, by what Affairs obstructed I shall not determine,</HI> did nothing in it that Session, but reassumed it in 1670, and Impowered the King by an Act 22. <HI>Carol.</HI> 2. almost in the Terms the <HI>Scots</HI> had done before.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="54"/>
The Parliament of <HI>Scotland</HI> pursuant to this, granted a Com∣mission for a Treaty, which was almost <HI>Verbatim</HI> the same with that granted in <HI>England;</HI> that no Debates might arise between the Commissioners of both Kingdoms, about the Difference of their Commissions, as had fallen out in the year 1604.</P>
<P>And because I shall endeavour to relate Matter of Fact, Abstracted from my own Observations in this History, I have with some Diffi∣culty, obtained an Original Manuscript of the Minutes of this short Treaty—; Which are as follows.</P>

<P>Before the General Meeting of the Commissioners of both Kingdoms, this day the Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> met in their own Chamber, and it was agreed, That what the Lord Keeper shall propose at the General Meeting, be done in the Name of the Commissioners.</P>
<P>Then the Commissioners of both Kingdoms being met, the Lord Keeper of the Great Seal offered to the Board what the Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> had agreed on, on <HI>Saturday</HI> last, as Preliminaries for the better proceeding in this Treaty, the Substance whereof being assented to by the Commissioners for <HI>Scotland,</HI> it was agreed, the Committee of the Commissioners of both Kingdoms should be appointed for the Wording of what was agreed to, and to Report unto the Board.</P>
<P>Also his Lordship proposed the Third Head in His Maje∣sties Message to be the First Article to be debated, which was assented to by the Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland;</HI> But some Objection being made against the Words <HI>(And Successors)</HI> in that Head, the Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> withdrew to their Chamber to consider thereof, and what Words were fit to be assented to; Where, after some Debate, their Lordships re∣solved, That, if the Commissioners for <HI>Scotland,</HI> at their Lordships Return, should insist upon leaving out these Words, <HI>(And Successors)</HI> to yield to them therein.</P>
<P>While the Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> were in their Cham∣ber, a Message was brought from the Commissioners for <HI>Scot∣land</HI> by their Clerk, to know whether their Lordships would Name their Committee there, or at the Board; Upon which their Lordships Named the Earl of <HI>Anglesey,</HI> Master Attourney General, and Sir <HI>Leoline Jenkins,</HI> and returned Answer, That they had Named a Committee of their Commissioners.</P>
<P>Then the Commissioners returning to the General Meeting, after some Debate upon the Third Head, agreed to leave out the Words <HI>(And Successors),</HI> and that the Monarchy be Stiled by the Name of <HI>Great-Britain.</HI> Then the Lords Commissio∣ners for <HI>Scotland</HI> let their Lordships know, That they had ap∣pointed the Earl of <HI>Kincardine,</HI> the Lord Advocate, and Sir <HI>Robert Murray,</HI> to be their Committee; And the Commissio∣ners for <HI>England</HI> Named the Earl of <HI>Auglesey,</HI> Master Attourney General, and Sir <HI>Leoline Jenkins,</HI> whom they had appointed to be of the said Committee; Which Committee were also ap∣pointed to Word the Third Head as agreed to, and to meet when and where they pleased, so as to be ready to make a Re∣port on <HI>Saturday</HI> next.

<P>The Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> being met in their Cham∣ber, the Earl of <HI>Anglesey</HI> Reported what the Committee of the Commissioners of both Kingdoms had prepared, pursuant to their Lordships Order, at the General Meeting of the Com∣missioners of both Kingdoms, upon consideration had where∣of, it was proposed, That some Words might be added to the second Preliminary Article, to take off all Jealousies that may remain of any use to be made hereafter, of what shall be put into Instruments <HI>Tripartite,</HI> if the Parliaments of both King∣doms shall not think fit to Confirm the same, whereupon a Message was sent from their Lordships to the Commissioners of <HI>Scotland,</HI> (in their Chamber) to desire, That the Com∣mittee of the Commissioners of both Kingdoms might meet again presently in the Great Room; which being consented to, the said Committee met, and agreed to alter and add to the second Preliminary, in manner following.</P>
<P>That nothing which shall be Agreed, or Assented to by the Commissioners of both Kingdoms in their Treaty, shall be taken as the Opinion or Resolution of the said Commissioners, nor drawn into Consequence, or any ways made use of as such, until the whole, which shall be Agreed unto, be re∣duced into Instruments <HI>Tripartite,</HI> under the Hands and Seals of the said Commissioners, according to their respective Com∣missions, nor then neither, unless the same being presented to, shall be Approved and Ratified by the respective Parlia∣ments, so as this Preliminary be not understood to leave room for Debate, or Change of any thing by the Commis∣sioners, which shall be put under their Hands and Seals, as aforesaid.</P>
<P>Which Alteration and Addition, being Reported by the Earl of <HI>Anglesey</HI> to the Commissioners for <HI>England,</HI> was Approved of.</P>
<P>Then the Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> sent a Message to the Commissioners for <HI>England,</HI> desiring that the said Com∣mittee might meet again presently in the Great Room, which was agreed to, where being met, the Committee of the Com∣missioners for <HI>Scotland,</HI> proposed an Addition to be made to the first Article of Union agreed upon, of these Words, <HI>(They</HI>
 <PB N="26" REF="59"/> <HI>being of the Progeny and Posterity of King</HI> James, <HI>His Majesties Royal Grandfather of Glorious Memory)</HI> Which Addition the Earl of <HI>Anglesey</HI> Reported to the Commissioners for <HI>England,</HI> whose Lordships upon Debate thereof, agreed to offer at the General Meeting of the Commissioners of both Kingdoms, the Article thus altered. That the two Kingdoms shall be in∣separably United into one Monarchy under His Majesty and the Heirs of his Body, and for want of such Heirs, under the Body of King <HI>James</HI> His Majesties Royal Grandfather of Glo∣rious Memory.</P>
<P>Then the Commissioners of both Kingdoms being met, the Lord Keeper of the Great Seal Read the two Preliminary Articles, prepared by the said Committees, to which the Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> declared their Agreement, and the Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> theirs; Also his Lordship Read the two Articles of Union upon the third Head in His Ma∣jesties Message worded by the said Committees, with the Addition of such Words, as the Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> upon the Motion of the Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> thought fit to Assent unto, to which Articles the whole Board con∣senting, the said Preliminary Articles of Union were writ∣ten fair, and signed by the respective Clerks, and then (being openly Read again by the Clerk attending the Commissioners for <HI>England</HI>) were interchangeably delivered to the Com∣missioners of both Kingdoms, to be Entred in their respective Books, and signed by both Clerks.</P>
<P>Next the Earl of <HI>Lauderdale,</HI> Lord Commissioner for <HI>Scotland,</HI> offered the first Head in his Majesties Message, to be then proceeded on <HI>(viz.)</HI> The preserving to either King∣dom their Laws Civil and Ecclesiastical intire, to which his Lordship declared, they did agree in General, but differed as to the Meaning of it; Thus,</P>
<P>That the Laws and Customs, Civil, Criminal, and Ec∣clesiastick Judicatories and Offices of either Kingdom be pre∣served, and remain intire in all time coming, as they are before the Union.

Up∣on which the Commissioners for both Kingdoms being met, the Lord Keeper offered to the Board, That the Commissio∣ners for <HI>England</HI> had considered of the Proposition made by the Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> upon the First Head in His Majesties Message, now under Consideration; And having read the Proposition, told their Lordships, That, as the Pro∣position is made, the Parliament which will be for <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> will have no Legislative Power to alter or change any Laws, how grievous soever; Besides, there will be no Power any where to alter the Laws in <HI>Scotland,</HI> tho' the Sub∣jects of <HI>Scotland</HI> should desire it; And therefore desired their Lordships, the Commissioners for <HI>Scotland,</HI> to Explain their Meaning upon that Proposition.</P>
<P>Whereupon the Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> desired to withdraw, whose Lordships soon after returning, the Earl of <HI>Lauderdale</HI> delivered the Meaning of the Commissio∣ners for <HI>Scotland</HI> as follows, <HI>viz.</HI> Our Meaning is not hereby to determine every particular Law of <HI>Scotland</HI> to be unalterable, but we cannot say any thing to the way of al∣tering,

<P>Any one that peruses this short Treaty, or rather Conference, may see, That these Times were not Tempered for an Effectual Union; And those that know any Thing of the Secret History of that Day, will also know, there were private Designs then on Foot, which made a nearer Union, inconsistent with the Views of the Court.</P>
<P>The <HI>Scots</HI> insisted on a Conjunction of Parliaments, not an In∣corporation of Foundations, <HI>as has now been proposed; England</HI> durst never hear of such a Conjunction of Parliaments, on Account of Church Matters; Knowing, That, tho' Episcopacy was then Established in <HI>Scotland,</HI> yet, that the Secret Bent of that Nation was Presbyterian; and they durst not think of a Conjunction of Houses on that Score.</P>
<P>And here I would ask leave of the Gentlemen in <HI>Scotland,</HI> who have Opposed the present Union, in regard of its Hazard to the Presbyterian Church, <HI>to Re-mind them,</HI> what reason they have to look back to the Days of this Treaty, <HI>and be Thankful,</HI> That the Union was not Compassed at this Time; and to consider why they should have ventured putting it off to a further Time, since, had it happned in that Time, when Episcopacy had the Face of a legal Establishment in <HI>Scotland,</HI> the Presbyterian Church had for ever sunk under its Weight, and been Exploded by the Laws of both Kingdoms; both Kingdoms had been obliged to keep it down, and it could never, <HI>Miracles excepted,</HI> have recovered it self in that Nation.</P>
<P>And thus I have Traced the several Endeavours to Unite these Kingdoms in former Times, in which I have been as Brief as I can: I shall conclude this with only one Remark, which I believe will appear to be just; Thro' the whole Course of the several Treaties hitherto named, the first excepted, which was disappointed by a meer Judgment from Heaven, <HI>I mean the Death of the Maid of</HI> Norway; All the rest of the Proposals for Union between these Kingdoms, met with their particular Obstructions from Popery, <HI>French-</HI>Interest, Home-Tyranny or Court-Intrigues; These were
<PB N="31" REF="64"/>
the only Enemies of Union, and I believe it may, without Partia∣lity be added, <HI>AND SO IT IS NOW:</HI></P>
<P>We are now come to the present Times, King <HI>James</HI> the II: in <HI>England,</HI> or VII. in <HI>Scotland,</HI> had no other Union in View, but that of Uniting all his Kingdoms, to the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> and this put him upon Measures perfectly distinct from all that had gone before him, from whence we have had Two Famous <HI>Revolutions</HI> in <HI>Britain,</HI> one in the Regal State of both Kingdoms, the other in the Ecclesiastick State of <HI>Scotland,</HI> from Episcopal to Presbyterian:—This was no sooner brought to pass, but <HI>Scotland</HI> put the King in mind of their Desires to Unite, in their Letter to King <HI>Wil∣liam;</HI> Of which presently—. But all that Prince's Reign, this good Design met with Obstructions, of which I shall be some∣thing particular in its place. And thus we are brought down to Queen <HI>Anne,</HI> in whose Reign this great Work was once Attempted, but proved Abortive, and at the second Essay was brought to Perfection, as will be seen in the Sequel of this Story.</P>

<HEAD>OF AFFAIRS IN BOTH KINGDOMS, INTRODUCTORY OF A TREATY of UNION.</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE I enter upon the Proceedings in the Reign of Queen <HI>ANNE,</HI> towards a General Union of these Kingdoms, it is absolutely necessary to the right Understanding of Things, to take a short View of the Posture of Publick Affairs in the respective Kingdoms, and what it was that rendred the Union so absolutely Necessary at this Time, that to all Considering People, who made any tolerable Judgment of Things, it was plain, there was no other way left, to prevent the most Bloody War that ever had been between the two Nations.</P>
<P>At the Revolution, as has been already Noted, and several times during the Reign of the late King <HI>William,</HI> Motions had been made frequently both on the King's Side and on the Peoples also, to come to a Treaty; But that Prince had always one Thing or other cast in his Way, to prevent his good Design.</P>
<P>The King was often heard to say, That this Island could never be Easie without a Union, and if either of them understood their own Happiness, they would never rest till it was brought to pass. And, as I had the Honour to mention it once among other Things, in a Scheme of General Peace among the Protestant In∣terests in <HI>Europe, I can not forget,</HI> That His Majesty Expressing some Concern at it, Returned, <HI>I have done all I can in that Affair, but I do not see a Temper in either Nation that looks like it</HI>—; And added, after some other Discourse, <HI>It may be done, but not yet.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="66"/>
During the whole Reign of this Prince, the Breaches between the two Kingdoms rather Widened and Increased, than tended to a Close, and several National Unkindnesses past between them, which prepared both Sides as it were to Reflect upon, and Re∣proach the other; There wanted not also a Set of wicked Instru∣ments always to blow the Coals of Discord between the Kingdoms into a Flame, and if possible, to bring the Nations to a Rupture.</P>
<P>Some of these Passages which, I say, tended to Estrange the Na∣tions, and as it were prepare them for a Breach, rather than for an Union, were these,<LIST>
<ITEM>The settling an <HI>African</HI> or <HI>Indian</HI> Company in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and the several Clashings of Interest between the two Nations on that Head.</ITEM>
<ITEM>The Affairs of <HI>Glenco.</HI></ITEM>

<P>All these Things concurred, to convince those that had the least Knowledge of Affairs in both Kingdoms, that nothing but an Uni∣on could prevent the Nations falling all to pieces, as soon as ever the Queen should Die, if not sooner; and that therefore it was immediately and heartily to be set about, as the only way to pre∣serve the publick Tranquillity, and prevent the certain Mischiefs that threatned the whole Body.</P>
<P>I shall not enter into a particular History of these several Cases, as being too tedious for this Tract, but as 'tis necessary to say some∣thing of them, to convey the right Understanding of these Matters to Posterity, and that more regularly to introduce the General Thing I am upon, <HI>viz.</HI> The Union, I cannot wholly Omit them.</P>
<P>And <HI>First, For the African Company,</HI> the large Commission that Company obtained, by which they seem'd to Rival the <HI>English,</HI> both in their <HI>Guinea, East-India,</HI> and <HI>West-India</HI> Trade, was ill relish'd by the <HI>English,</HI> who at that Time were in an Odd and Unsettled Posture, as to those Trades at Home. And as this is not rightly un∣derstood by a great many, that run round about for Reasons of the <HI>English</HI> Parliament's falling upon that Affair, it may not be a miss to set it in a clearer Light.</P>
<P>The <HI>English East India</HI> Trade, being for a long time Prescrib'd in the narrow Limits of an exclusive Company, who Tyrannized not a little in their absolute Management of that Trade, and be∣came Grievous to the rest of the Merchants, many Attempts were made to lay open their Stock, and Increase so great, and so Bene∣ficial a Trade; But the Company withstood all the Attempts that way, and kept all Invaders off; till at last by the mighty Advance of Two Millions to the Government, the New <HI>East-Indian</HI> Company got a Charter, and set up against them—; How they Rival'd
<PB N="34" REF="67"/>
one another, and with mighty Struggles, too much Embarrassed the whole Nation; till the King himself was obliged to concern himself in Uniting them, and how he brought that great Work to pass, are Things not so much to my present purpose; But at this time, <HI>viz.</HI> 26 <HI>June</HI> 1695, the <HI>Scots</HI> Company obtained their Settle∣ment.</P>
<P>What ever Prospects the Projectors of that Company had in their View, some of which will, <HI>I doubt,</HI> hardly bear a History, I never heard one of them pretend, That either the Stock to carry it on, or the Market for their Trade, could be found in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and from hence, with other particular Objections, which I believe they never Debated, I pretend to say, They could never really pro∣pose any rational probability of Success.</P>
<P>If they imagined to obtain Help from Abroad, they indeed were in the right, for they could not but know, That the Merchants in <HI>England</HI> would leap at a Proposal to get into the <HI>East-India</HI> Trade, free from the Bondage of the Company mentioned before—; But if they imagined also, That this could do less than Embark the <HI>English</HI> Government against them, and bring the Publick to concern themselves about it, they were exceeding Short-sighted, or must at the same Time believe, the other very Ignorant in the Affairs before them.</P>
<P>The first Step the Company took, was to open Books for Sub∣scriptions at <HI>London,</HI> and afterwards at <HI>Hamburgh,</HI> and this was no sooner done, but the <HI>English</HI> Company took the Alarm at both; and obtained by their Interest with the Government, Instructions to the <HI>English</HI> Resident at <HI>Hamburgh,</HI> to Oppose it there, which was done most effectually. The <HI>English</HI> Resident, as it was said, ta∣citely Threatning the <HI>Hamburghers,</HI> That the <HI>English</HI> should remove their Staple of Cloth to the City of <HI>Bremen,</HI> and ruine the Trade of <HI>Hamburgh,</HI> whether he did actually Threaten them so or no, I do not Affirm, but 'tis certain, he so managed Affairs, that the Subscriptions begun there, were stopt, and the Design on that Side effectually ruined; Then they, <HI>I mean the</HI> English East-India <HI>Com∣pany,</HI> Applyed themselves to the <HI>English</HI> Parliament, and by offer∣ing plausible Reasons there, soon obtained their Votes against it also, and against any of the Subjects of <HI>England</HI> Subscribing to it, and the <HI>Scots</HI> Merchants who had subscribed in <HI>England,</HI> were or∣dered to be Impeacht of a Misdemeanour, tho' the Parliament being near a Close, those Impeachments dropt of course.</P>
<P>These things had the desired Effect, for they crushed the Attempt of raising a <HI>New</HI> East-India <HI>Company</HI> in these Parts of the World, and the Projectors then played their other Game of <HI>Darien,</HI> in which they had the same Unhappiness, <HI>viz.</HI> To put the <HI>English</HI> Na∣tion under a Necessity of Opposing them.</P>
<P>I do readily allow, the first Scheme of a Trade to the <HI>East-Indies</HI> had a Probability of Success in it, a Thing I can not grant to the Affair of <HI>Darien;</HI> which, I think, had not one Branch belonging to its Contrivance, but what was Big with necessary Abortions,
<PB N="35" REF="68"/>
such as remote Mines of Gold to be gained and maintained by Force against the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> in which <HI>England</HI> could not without Breach of Faith assist, such as a Trade for <HI>European</HI> Goods with the <HI>Spanish</HI> Colonies, which must always have been by Force or by Stealth, and neither of these had any Rational Probability.</P>
<P>As to their Trade over Land to the South Seas, and thence to the <HI>Indies,</HI> tho' much boasted of, it answers for it self, and seems a too Impracticable Whimsy to merit any Reply, much like that other Dream of making a Navigation, or Communication between the South Seas and the Gulph of <HI>Mexico,</HI> by the River of <HI>Darien</HI>—; Which, if all were done, and the Distance measured to that Part of <HI>India,</HI> to which we chiefly Trade, <HI>viz.</HI> The Coast of <HI>Coromondel, Surrat,</HI> Bay of <HI>Bengal, &amp;c.</HI> I think any Body will de∣termine the Voyage by the <HI>Cape de Bon Esperance,</HI> the better Passage by much, and very little if any thing longer.</P>
<P>But to come to the Case, the Company, or rather the Projectors, who had now embark'd the Gentlemen in a Subscription of 400000 Pounds <HI>Sterling,</HI> carried on their Design, and with Two Ships.</P>
<P>Men and a Cargo perfectly unqualified for any kind of Trade, ei∣ther with <HI>English,</HI> or <HI>Spaniards,</HI> set Sail, and landing at <HI>Darien,</HI> made a Settlement there, fortified themselves, and prepared to maintain it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who claim a Right there, and whether that Right be disputeable or no, is not the Question here, immediately pro∣ceed by a double Method, first, To prepare to dislodge them by Force, and secondly, Apply themselves to the King of <HI>England,</HI> claiming, <HI>by virtue of the Treaty made with</HI> England, <HI>Ratified and Exchanged,</HI> That no Succour should be given to the <HI>Scots</HI> from any of the <HI>English</HI> Colonies in <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P>This, as an express Stipulation, could not be denyed by the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> Court, and accordingly a Proclamation was exhibited by the King of <HI>England,</HI> and sent to all the <HI>English</HI> Plantations, forbidding Trade or Correspondence with them.</P>
<P>I cannot help saying, had the Managers of the Companies Af∣fairs had the least Forecast of Things, they could not but have expected all that happened here; And also might have known, That, had they Acted right, those Proclamations could have done them no manner of Damage.</P>
<P>Whover has the least Knowledge of the Affairs of that Country, and of the Trade of the <HI>English</HI> Colonies, must needs know, That, had the <HI>Scots</HI> Company, who had plac'd themselves at <HI>Darien,</HI> been furnish'd either with Money, or Letters of Credit, they had never wanted Provisions, or come to any other Disaster, notwithstand∣ing the Proclamations of the <HI>English</HI> against Correspon∣dence.</P>
<P>Nor will any Man be so vain to say, That they ought to have ventured on such a Settlement, depending on Supplies from the <HI>English,</HI> especially when, in their Affairs of <HI>Hamburgh</HI> and <HI>London,</HI> which were before all this, they had seen the <HI>English</HI> concerning
<PB N="35" REF="69"/>
themselves against their Company; Much less should they have gone to Plant themselves in a Climate unfit for Product it self, with neither Cash, nor Credit, to Buy in other Places.</P>
<P>At last 'tis apparent, That, notwithstanding the Proclamations, and after all the Officious Care of the Governours of the <HI>English</HI> Colonies, yet several Sloops of Provisions came to them, but found them on the other Hand unfurnish'd to purchase, except with such Goods as were fit for no Market, nor could they give Bills any where to make Good the Value.</P>
<P>The Trade to the <HI>Spanish West-Indies</HI> is forbidden in those Parts, under the severest Penalties of Loss of Goods, Confiscation of the Ship, and Death of the People; And yet we see, That, at <HI>Ja∣maica</HI> for the <HI>English,</HI> and <HI>Curasoe</HI> for the <HI>Dutch,</HI> they carry on a prodigious Trade encouraged by the Gain of it.</P>
<P>Had the <HI>Scots</HI> at <HI>Darien</HI> had any thing sufficient to encoutage the Traders thither, they had never wanted Provisions; And as they were unprovided that way, they must have starved, had there been no Prohibitions at all, for they would have found few of the Planters, or Merchants of the Colonies, inclined to have furnish'd them without Money.</P>
<P>This I think clears up the Case sufficiently, and therefore I shall say no more to it here; 'Tis thus far to the present Purpose, <HI>That,</HI> This Disaster of the <HI>Scots, be the Fault where it will,</HI> was one of the great Occasions of Ill Blood between the Nations, while those that took all Opportunities to widen our Breaches on both Sides, con∣tinually cryed out in <HI>England,</HI> That the <HI>Scots</HI> were encroaching upon our Trade, and setting up a New <HI>East-India</HI> Trade—; And, on the other Hand, in <HI>Scotland,</HI> they complained of the Un∣natural and Barbarous Treatment of the <HI>English</HI>—; Both which took with the Common People of either Nations, to the Un∣speakable Disquieting of their Minds, and raising continual Re∣proaches against one another, without giving themselves leave to enquire into the Grounds and Reasons of Things.</P>
<P>I have been the larger on this Head, because I think this to be the first Handle that our Quarrelsome People took Hold of to Ob∣ject against one another, and on which the future Jealousies between the Nations were pretended to be built.</P>
<P>The Affair of <HI>Glenco</HI> was another Step to National Breaches; And tho' every Body tells me, I must handle this very gently, perhaps they may see, there is not so much Cause for it, as they imagine.</P>
<P>And having the Honour to have had something of this from Persons very near the King, and perhaps from His Majesties own Mouth; I shall only state the General so far as it has been report∣ed to the Injury of that Glorious Prince, and to the exciting Natio∣nal Animosities between us.</P>
<P>In doing this, I shall only avoid Naming of Persons, let the Guilt dye in their Graves, we are not now calling up the Persons to Judgment, but setting the Matter in a clear Light.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="70"/>
That the <HI>Glenco-men</HI> among several other <HI>Clans</HI> of the <HI>High∣landers,</HI> were Enemies to the Government at that time, had been in Arms under <HI>Dundee,</HI> and had on all occasions shown their impla∣cable Aversion to King <HI>William,</HI> and all the Interest of the Revolu∣tion, needs no Proof, and is own'd even by the greatest Friends to the Cause.</P>
<P>That these People were not only very troublesome, bu tdange∣rous, and had committed several Hostilities, Murders, Robberies and Depredations, on both the Innocent Country People their Neigh∣bours, as well as on the Garrisons of Souldiers plac'd on that side to suppress them, is also out of dispute.</P>
<P>The Defence made for this is short, That they were fair Enemies and had profess't open War.</P>
<P>It is Answered thus, That <LIST>
<ITEM>1. They cannot be own'd as open Enemies, because they really had no Commissions from King <HI>James.</HI> And 2<HI>ly,</HI> The War was as it were supprest; the Generality had laid down their Arms, and submitted; and these as a few Desperado's kept up the Quarrel rather as an advantage of Rapine and Plunder, than a Service to their pretended Master, or his Cause.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Suppose them at open War, It has been the known Prac∣tice in War, when a Governour of a Garrison holds out with∣out Expectation of Relief, without any prospect but meer Des∣peration and Mischief, to give such no Quarter; no Conditions at all, but even after taking the Place to hang them up in cold Blood, as wild Beasts, that make no fair War, and deserve no fair Treatment.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>As His Majesty had this Account given him of these People, and I do not find but it was a true Account too, it was the Advice of the General and Officers imployed at that time, that it was a Mis∣chief which as Times then went might be very dangerous to the Pub∣lick; &amp; that therefore it behoved them to take some immediate Course with them; And since desperate Mischiefs require Remedies of the same kind, they thought the first Force the best, and proposed to march immediately with a Body of Troops into the Place, and in∣tirely root them out as a Den of Thieves and Destroyers, without which the peaceable Subjects could never be safe, nor the Govern∣ment be easie; That the Charge of maintaining Troops there, was an in∣tolerable Burden to the Countrey, and as there was no other way could prevail to preserve the Peace, it was absolutely necessary to come to Extremity.</P>
<P>His Majesty, who by his Experience in Military Affairs, was soon convinc'd both of the Justice in Point of War, &amp; Necessity in Point of Government of this Advice; yet out of His meer Goodness of Disposition &amp; general Clemency, answered, <HI>He agreed to their Reasons,</HI> but requi∣red that before any such Extremities should be used with them, a Proclamation should be published, offering Pardon, or Remission for all Violences, and Villanies past, to all these People without Excep∣tion, who within a certain time should come in, lay down their
<PB N="38" REF="71"/>
Arms, and submit to the Government, and take the Oaths as peace∣able Subjects.</P>
<P>'Tis here visible that His Majesties Intentions were not only Just and Honourable to these People, <HI>tho his implacable Enemies,</HI> but that he resolved like a merciful Prince, to try all reasonable Me∣thods of Tenderness, and Goodness, if possible, to keep the Peace, and save the Offenders too.</P>
<P>With this Proclamation, Commission was given to the Military Power, if this merciful Method could not prevail, they should proceed to Extremities; and by Force of Arms destroy all those that should stand out, and not comply with the Proclamation. And His Majesties Orders were, as far as relates to this part, as follows.</P>
<P>The Instructions were to Sir <HI>Thomas Livingstoun,</HI> dated <HI>Jan.</HI> 11. 1692. the first Clause is thus,</P>
<P><HI>You are hereby Ordered and Authorized to march our Troops which are now posted at</HI> Innerlochie <HI>and</HI> Innerness <HI>to act against those Highland Rebels who have not taken the benefite of Our Indem∣nity, by Fire and Sword, and all manner of Hostilities, to burn their Houses, seize or destroy their Goods, Cattel, Plenishing or Clothes, and to cut off the Men.</HI></P>
<P>The Fourth Article runs thus,</P>
<P><HI>That the Rebels may not think themselves absolutely desperate, we allow you to give Terms and Quarters, but we are so convinc'd of the Necessity of Severity, and that they cannot be reclaim'd, that we will not allow you to give any other Terms to Chiftains, Heretors, or Leaders, but to be Prisoners of War, whereby their Lives are saved; but for all other things they must surrender on Mercy, and take the Oath of Alledgeance.</HI></P>
<P>In Additional Instructions, one Clause is thus dated 16 <HI>Jan.</HI> 1692.</P>
<P><HI>If that</HI> Mackean <HI>of</HI> Glenco <HI>and his Tribe can be well separated from the rest, it will be a proper Vindication of the publick justice to ex∣tirpate that Sect of Thieves.</HI></P>
<P>Thus far I think I may undertake to say His Majesty proceeded, by the known Custom of all the most just Governments in the World, and it would be needless to Examine Histories to bring Precedents here to justifie the Method.</P>
<P>It is certain, and all Men allow that the <HI>Glenco-men</HI> had not com∣plyed with the Proclamation; Nay they had rejected two Indemni∣ties.</P>
<P>I know 'tis objected, that <HI>Glenco</HI> came and took the Oath six days after the time, made a legal and just Excuse, and sent word of his willingness to comply with it, and that it was only a Trespass of Time, which they supposed he had repaired, that the end of the Proclamation was answered, and that the King who was mercifully inclin'd, would never have taken the Lives of People resolved to submit for a Trespass of days.</P>
<P>To this I answer, as His Majesty himself did in that Case, that indeed had he been in the Field, and on the Spot, and that Excuse had been sent to him, he might have accepted it—, But that as
<PB N="39" REF="72"/>
Commissions in Cases of War, are to be punctually Executed, he could not require it of the Officers to accept it, as an Excuse against a positive Proclamation, and an express Order; Besides, I do not find any, but the Chief had gone thus far, the rest not having come in at all.</P>
<P>It is alledged, That the Execution was from private Malice—; but none could ever yet have the Face to charge His Majesty with that, and I could never hear of any Reason given why the Com∣manders of the Forces should have any, much less those at whom the Scandal of it was pointed, upon pretence of giving Unwar∣rantable Orders.</P>
<P>But the Case chiefly lyes here, the Men fell under the Misfortune of a Crisis in War, they brought themselves into it by an Omission of Time, to say, They could not avoid it, does not reach the Case, if the Officers can be charged with any private Revenge in this Case, I have only this to say.<LIST>
<ITEM>1. I never yet saw any Reason to think so, no Personal Grudge or Quarrel ever appeared, that I ever met with, or was so much as—, alledged in it, or Gain pretended to be made by it, if the E. of <HI>B.</HI>—had any private Game, it nei∣ther affected the King, nor the other Persons Charged with the Thing.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. If it were so, it no way affects the King, against whom the Reproach of this Affair is since pointed, who acted no∣thing but what was agreeable to the Laws of War, and mixt it with that General Blessing of his Temper, an unusual Cle∣mency.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>If the Commission given was Executed with Barbarity, and Blood, Killing People in what we call cold Blood, surprizing them in Peace, and Dependence on Safety, all this will turn upon the Merits of the first Cause; For if they were by the Laws of War to be Destroyed, all manner of Surprizes become Justified by the same Law: As to the Cruelties and Excesses of the Furious Soldiers, no Man can have the Face to Reproach His Majesty with that.</P>
<P>The Grand Question remains yet behind, Why did not the King cause the Offenders to be made Examples, and severely punish the Murderers.</P>
<P>I shall Answer,<LIST>
<ITEM>1. If His Majesties Peculiar was too much Clemency, I think some of those that make loudest Exclamations on this Article ought to be silent, since, had Exemplar Justice been His Ma∣jesties Employment from his first Landing, we should have no Reason to have said, It was a Bloodless Revolution, nor they perhaps have been alive to Complain.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. For the Reasons aforesaid, His Majesty often said, it was <HI>a Moot-point</HI> in War, whether they had broke Orders or no, and tho' I have the Honour to know, that His Majesty ex∣ceedingly resented the Manner, yet it did not appear at all, that they had laid themselves open to Military Justice in it,
<PB N="40" REF="73"/>
or so much as given ground to call them to account before a Council of War.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>As to National or Civil Justice, the Memory of the King can never be Reflected upon in that, unless some Persons had pursued them at Law, obtained Sentence against them, and His Majesty had Protected them from the Prosecution or Execution of such Sen∣tences.</P>
<P>Thus far, I think, the King himself is intirely clear of this Mat∣ter, who else may have been Guilty, and how, either of breaking Orders, going beyond them on Niceties, and Executing them with Barbarities, I have no Occasion to enter upon here; I shall be far from Defending such Things, and I am sure His Majesty was far from Approving it.</P>
<P>But this is more compleatly Answered, by putting the World in mind, That His Majesty did refer the Prosecution of that Affair wholly to the Parliament, as more particularly appears by the Par∣liaments Address of Thanks to His Majesty for so doing.</P>
<P>And that in their Prosecution, they found no room for legal Pro∣cess, except against the Officer who Executed the Orders in a man∣ner so Barbarous, which Officer fled from Justice, and was Pro∣scribed for not Compearing.</P>
<P>So that here was no legal Process interrupted, but all was Frank∣ly remitted by His Majesty to the severest Methods of Justice, which if it would not reach the Persons concerned, 'tis very hard the Slander should reach the King.</P>
<P>It might be said here, You have no Occasion to Defend the King's Memory in this Case, since the Parliament of <HI>Scotland</HI> clear'd His Majesty, by their Unanimous Vote of 14<HI>th.</HI> of <HI>June, viz.</HI> That His Majesties Instructions contained no Warrant for the Execution of the <HI>Glenco</HI> Men.</P>
<P>I shall only Note, That it is true the Parliament past such a Vote, and 'tis as true, the King resented very ill their Usage of him, as he had great Reason to do, frequently repeating, That he Thank∣ed the Parliament of <HI>Scotland,</HI> they had used him better than <HI>Eng∣land</HI> had done his Grandfather, for they had Tryed him for his Life, and brought him in <HI>NOT GƲILTY.</HI> I must confess, it was very Unaccountable the House should pass such a Vote upon their Sovereign, whom no Man had had the Impudence to owne a Re∣flection upon in the Case, tho' they did it Clandestinely; and it had much better have become them, to have Searched after, and Punished those that Slandered the King on that Account.</P>
<P>But the Reproaching the King, and those imployed by him, and who under him gave Orders in it, had its Party Uses; what End it answered at that Time, is very well known, and would make a very good History, to the Reproach of some Pretenders to Revolu∣tion Principles; But I choose to bury these Things in Silence, nei∣ther are they any part of this Design.</P>
<P>I have Assign'd this as a second Ground of National Animosity, not that it was Acted by any of the <HI>English</HI> Nation, but as the
<PB N="41" REF="74"/>
Gentlemen who improved it, turned it all against the King, it was still furnishing matter of Railry against the Revolution, and Suc∣cession, which both turned upon one Point, and was now sup∣ported and pusht on in <HI>Scotland,</HI> by the Interest and Influence of the <HI>English</HI> Court.</P>
<P>I have Digrest upon the Subject on no other Ground, than to clear up the Reproaches which Envy would fain fix on the King and his Memory, which, I think, not at all accountable for it.</P>
<P N="3">3. The next General Head, on which our National Discontents have been Revived, and indeed which has been strangely Issued, has been the Succession of the Crown.</P>
<P>This has a long Chain of Derivations to fetch it from, but I'll Contract them into as small a Compass as I can.</P>
<P>The Original of the whole Debate is to be placed, if we will do Justice, in His late Majesties sincere and constant Care for the Peace and Security of these Kingdoms.</P>
<P>The King had seen the Prospects of an <HI>Ʋnion</HI> fly like a remote Shadow, as it were out of Ken, and finding reason to lay aside the Thoughts of that blessed Conjunction, he found the next Step needful was, to preserve the Publick Peace, and hand down our Liberties to Posterity, under the same Security he had so happily Fixt them in; in order to this, His Majesty began to set himself seriously to Work, to settle the Succession of the Crown in the Protestant Line.</P>
<P>Before I enter into this large Field, I must take one Opportunity more to Exalt the Memory of the King, and put these Nations in mind of the Care that Prince took, abstracted from his own In∣terest, to settle both the Liberties and Religion of this Island, in spight of all the ill Treatment he met with here.</P>
<P>Upon the Revolution, a great deal of Clamour and Reproach had been Level'd at the King, as if he pursued his own Interest in the taking the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> tho' I must acknowledge I am at a Loss, to find out what he Gain'd by it, tho' I have had Opportunities to know something of His Majesties Affairs; But sure, no Body could Charge His Majesty with having an Eye to his Interest, in what should happen after his Death; He could have nothing to propose to himself beyond the Grave; It could be of no Moment to him, who should Enjoy the Crown after him, since he had no Children of his own, nor could he expect the Succession should come to any Branch of his Family.</P>
<P>Covetousness and Ambition may guide Princes in their Pursuit of Honours and Possessions, to themselves and their Families, but when a Prince has no Family, no Relations that can Enjoy after him, it can not be Rational to talk of Ambition or Interest in that Case.</P>
<P>His Majesties Memory is therefore Untainted, and even the Ene∣mies of his Fame are Defeated <HI>here;</HI> for <HI>the very pretence fails them,</HI> his Anxiety for the Settlement of the Succession, could savour of nothing but a meer Concern and Respect for the Interest, Safety,
<PB N="42" REF="75"/>
and Liberty of the Countrey, and let any Man give any other ra∣tional Account of it, if he can; <HI>But this is by the way.</HI></P>
<P>In pursuit of this Original Design, His Majesty laid the Ground-Plot of the Succession to the House of <HI>Hannover,</HI> went himself to <HI>Hannover,</HI> and thence to <HI>Zell,</HI> to Concert the Measures of it on that Side, Master'd some Difficulties there too, and then proposed it to the <HI>English</HI> Parliament.</P>
<P>How it passed in the <HI>English</HI> Nation, what Opposition was made to it <HI>there, and by whom,</HI> what subsequent Laws were made to strengthen and support it, is not much to the present Purpose to Examine, Histories are full of the particular Circumstances, and no Body that knows any thing of what past in those Times, can be ignorant of it.</P>
<P>It remained only to make the same Provision for <HI>Scotland;</HI> and the King began to turn his Eyes thither, when he was taken off by Death; And Queen <HI>ANNE</HI> Succeeded not to his Crown only, but to the same Care and Concern for the Publick Peace, and for the Settlement of the Nations, by securing the Succession of the Crown.</P>
<P>But to look into <HI>Scotland</HI> a little, the <HI>Scots</HI> receiv'd the Proposal of the Succession, with more Coldness &amp; Diffidence than was expected; and the Heats occasioned by the Debates on both Sides, were Ex∣traordinary; The Opposition made to the Continuation of their United State in a Successor, had a specious and most unanswerable Pretence to be made for it, tho' it was made Use of by two sorts of People, with a quite different Prospect.</P>
<P>The <HI>Scots</HI> had been very sensible of the visible Decay of Trade, Wealth, and Inhabitants in their Country, even from the first giving away their Kings to the <HI>English</HI> Succession, and as the Sinking Condition of their Nation, was plainly owing to the Loss of their Court, Concourse of People, the Disadvantages of Trade, and the Influence the <HI>English</HI> had over their Kings; So it was as plain, there was no way to Recover themselves, but either better Terms of Union and Alliance, or a Returning back to their separate Self-Existing State.</P>
<P>The most Confidering and Disinterested People, Reflected back upon their Easie Complying with the <HI>English,</HI> and Joyning with the Revolution, without any Conditions made for themselves with <HI>England</HI> as a Nation; <HI>And plainy said,</HI> If they had demanded bet∣ter Terms, they might have had them, since their Joyning at that Time was a Thing of such Consequence, and upon which so much did Depend, that <HI>England</HI> could not have denied them, and what they had to ask was so reasonable, that nothing in reason could have been objected.</P>
<P>The People who were of this Opinion, being some of them at the same Time, as far from Embarking in the wrong Interest, Mov'd Strenuously for a Treaty with <HI>England,</HI> to ascertain the Con∣ditions, <HI>Chiefly respecting Commerce,</HI> on which they were willing to
<PB N="43" REF="76"/>
settle the Crown; but were Unanimously for refusing to settle it at all, <HI>but with such a Treaty.</HI></P>
<P>As these Gentlemen insisted upon a Treaty with <HI>England,</HI> in case they settled the Succession with them, so they considered in the next place of Limitations, both in case of failing of such Treaty, or in case of its being Concluded, in order to preserve the Liberties of the People, and to Assert the Right and Power of Parliaments; And one of these Limitations was, That in case the Treaty did not succeed then in the settling the Crown, it was Provided, the Suc∣cessor should not be King or Queen of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>And yet I confess it seems plain to me, the Design of these Peo∣ple was not against having the Succession settled even in Conjuncti∣on with <HI>England,</HI> as it now is, and their General Behaviour since, Confirms this Opinion, besides the General Character of the Men themselves, but their Design appeared plainly to bring <HI>England</HI> over to such Terms in Matters of Commerce, as really it appeared <HI>Scot∣land</HI> wanted, and as <HI>England</HI> ought to Grant.</P>
<P>'Tis true, a Party Joyn'd in this, that were against any Conjuncti∣on at all, that were against any Succession but that of King <HI>James,</HI> and whose real Design was against the General Correspondence of the Nations, and both Sides had People among them who made use of these Things, further and further to Divide the Nation.</P>
<P>Nor did they fail of Success, for this was taken very Hainously in <HI>England,</HI> especially by the ignorant kind of People, and they began in <HI>England</HI> to Treat the <HI>Scots</HI> very Coursely; The Writers of the Age began to Discuss the separate Sovereignties, and Exalt the Titles of either Side.</P>
<P>In <HI>England,</HI> one Doctor <HI>Drake</HI> Writes a Preface to an Abridge∣ment of the <HI>Scots</HI> History, wherein speaking something Reflecting upon the Freedom and Independency of <HI>Scotland,</HI> the <HI>Scots</HI> Parlia∣ment caused it to be Burnt by the Hangman at <HI>Edinburgh.</HI> Another <HI>English</HI> Author Writes of the Absolute Dominion of the <HI>English</HI> Crown over the Crown of <HI>Scotland,</HI> but he received the just Pu∣nishment of being little regarded; Another Writes of the Easiness of Reducing <HI>Scotland</HI> by Arms—. Against these Mr. <HI>Anderson, Hodges,</HI> and others, Write of the Antiquity, Freedom, and Inde∣pendency of <HI>Scotland,</HI> Asserting it in the Face of the World, for which Books the Parliament Rewarded them publickly.</P>
<P>Thus, on both Sides, the Case stood between the Nations, a Pen and Ink War made a daily Noise in either Kingdom, and this ser∣ved to Exasperate the People in such a manner, one against ano∣ther, that never have two Nations Run upon one another in such a manner, and come off without Blows.</P>
<P>The Heats on both Sides being thus strangely blown up, and the People of either Kingdom beginning to run into Excesses—, just in this Juncture, as if the Nature and Necessity of the Thing had driven both Nations to it, the Queen proposes to the respective Parliaments, a Treaty of Union to be begun between the two King∣doms; This was in the year 1702, the Well-Wishers to the Na∣tions
<PB N="44" REF="77"/>
Peace earnestly longed for this Union on both Sides; But I cannot say that they had equal Expectations of it, as Times then went.</P>
<P>It was the first year of Her Majesty's Reign, and the Administrati∣on of things being then <HI>in hands</HI> in both Kingdoms, which Her Majesty afterward thought fit to change, there is not so much won∣der why this Treaty came to nothing.</P>
<P>There had been Obstructions to the Design in <HI>Scotland,</HI> where Things were yet carried with more Jealousie of the <HI>English</HI> Court than afterwards they saw Reason to do; This occasioned a Protest from one sort of Gentlemen against the Queens Naming the Com∣missioners to Treat—; But even the very Gentlemen who protest∣ed, thought fit afterwards to come in to the Union as it was pro∣posed, and had no small Influence in the Success of it.</P>
<P>The Success of the Union no doubt depended upon the Choice of the Persons appointed to Treat, and this depended very much on the Representation of the Ministry in either Nation to the Queen. As to the Ministry in <HI>Scotland</HI> I shall say nothing, the Gentlemen nominated there might perhaps have come into Measures for a Trea∣ty well enough, most of the former Treaters being the same as af∣terwards finished it—; But the Design of the Ministry in <HI>England</HI> seemed to act upon Measures not so consistent with the true Intent and Meaning of the Treaty as could have been wisht.</P>
<P>Again the Jealousness on both sides about Church Affairs, in re∣spect to the Union, were the ground of such Difficulties as no Body could surmount, and lay as a Secret Mine, with which that Party who designed to keep the Nation divided, were sure to blow it up at last, and therefore knew that all they did till that Point was dis∣cust signified nothing, and that when ever they pleased to put an end to it, they had an immediate Opportunity.</P>
<P>Without therefore entring upon such just Reflections as I might very well be allowed to make upon the several Persons, and Parts acting and acted in that, <HI>I had almost said sham Treaty,</HI> I may place the whole Miscarriages of it very justly upon <HI>this one Parti∣cular, viz,</HI> That the Affairs of Religion were left to the absolute Determination and Appointment of the Treaters, and this might have instructed any Body that this Treaty would come to nothing, since it was morally impracticable that the Nice Article of Religion, as it particularly then stood between the two Churches, could have been settled to the mutual Satisfaction of both Kingdoms by a Com∣mission, in which there was not one Person deputed or named by the Church, or instructed by them to enter upon the several Articles of a Treaty on either Hand.</P>
<P>I know it has been said, <HI>and perhaps there may have been some Truth in it,</HI> That the Article of Religion was to have lien passive and dormant, and neither Side was to have concerned themselves a∣bout it, by which some would have had it understood, that either Side was to remain in the Condition they were then in—, and that this was the Meaning of the words of a certain Person, who when
<PB N="45" REF="78"/>
he was ask't, what Care was taken of the Church in that Treaty, Replyed, <HI>For GOD's Sake, let Us have no more of that Jargon.</HI></P>
<P>I confess, It's a charitable Construction of the Words, to say, The Author only meant that Things should be left to stand as they were, and the Treaters should have no other Concern about it,—but I presume those People hardly considered that then the Establishment of either Church had been left intirely to the future Disposition of a <HI>British</HI> Parliament, who, whenever they were governed by a Majority on this or that Side might have Over-whelmed intirely the <HI>Scots</HI> Set∣tlement, and erected Episcopacy upon them, or <HI>Vice versa</HI> with the Church of <HI>England:</HI> And I presume neither Church would have thought themselves safe upon such a Foundation, I am sure, they would not have had Reason to have thought so.</P>
<P>Such a Precarious Union must needs have begot future Convulsi∣ons in both Kingdoms; And <HI>if We may judge by what has happned since,</HI> the Treaters would have met with but very Ordinary Recep∣tion in <HI>Scotland</HI> when they came Home, and the abandoning the Church to the Mercy of the Parliament, which was in Effect, giving Her up to the Church of <HI>England,</HI> would certainly have Inflamed the whole Countrey.</P>
<P>It is therefore the much kinder Reflection to say these Gentlemen never designed any Union at all, since to suppose the other, would be to suggest that they designed to give up their Native Countrey to a Bondage in Matters Religious, which they knew was Intolerable to their Countrey, and to lead them by the Hand to an Inevitable Breach between the Nations.</P>
<P>For this Reason I say, that Treaty was never sincerely design'd; if it was, it must reflect either upon the Understandings, or upon the Integrity of the Persons concern'd.</P>
<P>However, as I am here upon Matters of History, and collecting together all that has been done with relation to uniting the King∣doms, as well what was Abortive as what came to Perfection; I think this Work cannot be compleat without giving you the Minutes of this Treaty also, as far as it proceeded—; But because I would not interrupt the Threed of History, I have adjourned it to the <HI>Appendix,</HI> where you have it at large, as I received it from the hand of a Person of Honour and undoubted Integrity, who was one of the Commissioners to that Treaty, and wrote it down with his own Hand. The Minutes are marked in the <HI>Appendix</HI> (N 14.)</P>
<P>Upon the breaking up of this Treaty, three things happned to the further widening the unhappy Breaches between the Nations, which however they discovered the furious Temper of a Party of Men in both Kingdoms, ready and forward to inflame us and in∣volve both Nations in Blood, yet their evil Design had this happy Issue, that it brought the Nations to the <HI>Grisis</HI> which inevitably brought on the great Treaty; it put us all into such a Condition, that nothing but a Treaty for a nearer Union, or a Bloody and Ir∣reconcilable Rupture could be the Consequence—. And this I
<PB N="46" REF="79"/>
take to be a moving Argument, which in the Judgment of the Mi∣nistry made the Treaty of Union absolutely necessary, and thus the greatest Good came out of the greatest designed Evil.</P>
<P>The first of these was the Affair of Captain <HI>Green</HI> and the Ship <HI>Worcester.</HI> About the {left blank} an <HI>English</HI> Ship called the <HI>Worcester</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> Captain <HI>Thomas Green</HI> Commander, Home∣ward-bound from the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> put into <HI>Scotland,</HI> whether by contrary Winds, or for Convoy, or on what other occasion is not to the purpose.</P>
<P>The <HI>African</HI> Company there having a Ship formerly seized by the <HI>East-India</HI> Company in <HI>London,</HI> as she was fitting out in the River of <HI>Thames;</HI> And for which they had in vain solicited Resti∣tution, they obtain of the Government a Power to Seize and Stop this Ship by way of Reprisal.</P>
<P>Accordingly the Ship was seized on, and brought into <HI>Brunt-island,</HI> and some time passed while the Ship lay under such Circumstances.</P>
<P>During this Time, some of the Ships Crew, whether in their Drink, or otherwise, let fall some Words, implying that they had been Pirating, and particularly some very suspicious Discourses, in∣timating that there had been Blood in the Case.</P>
<P>This prompted further Enquiries, and at last a plain and particu∣lar Information was procured, that this Captain <HI>Green</HI> with this Ship <HI>Worcester</HI> had met with a <HI>Scots</HI> Ship commanded by one <HI>{left blank} Drummond</HI> in the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> had made Prize of the Ship, and Murthered <HI>Drummond</HI> and all his Crew.</P>
<P>These suspicious and dark Speeches were so taken hold of, and trac't, that at last it came upon the Stage, and brought <HI>Green</HI> and his Ships Crew into the Course of publick Justice, and after a very long Tryal, they were found guilty of <HI>Piracy, Robbe∣ry</HI> and <HI>Murder;</HI> And particularly the Captain and five more were condemned to Dye for it, and the Captain with two more were ac∣cordingly executed.</P>
<P>It is not the work of this Book to relate that Story at its full length, but I can not pass it here without a short Abridgement of the Proceedings; Because as <HI>Scotland</HI> lyes under much Scandal on this Account, which, as to the Methods of publick Justice, I think she does not deserve, so the clearing up that Point, and the Relation it has to the present Subject I am upon, I think will come out Hand in Hand; and for that Reason I ingage in it.</P>
<P>Some of <HI>Green</HI>'s Men, either in their Anger, or their Cups, or both, having let fall Words that rendred him very much suspected of having been guilty of great Villanies, they were further watch∣ed in their Discourse by some that had taken hold of their Words, particularly two Negroes, one <HI>Haines,</HI> and another, who, it seems, being disgusted at the Captain, frequently let fall such Expressions as gave the Hearers Reason to suspect there had been great Villanies among them. These Speeches are all to be seen in the Depositions of the Witnesses, too long to repeat here, and particularly in the Printed Tryal, to which I refer.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="80"/>
I shall not take upon me here, either to Condemn or Acquit either Side, I know the World is divided on the Subject, some will have <HI>Green</HI> and his Crew, to be Guilty of all that is Charged on them; others say, The Company carried all against them, that they might have a good Pretence for Confiscating the Ship. But be that as it will, it is most certain, the Folly and Imprudence of the Men Hang∣ed them, <HI>to say no more.</HI></P>
<P>From a little to more, from dark Expressions, they fell to down∣right Quarrelling, and calling one another Names, which there seems to be good reason to believe, might in part be true on both Sides, <HI>For some of them, however innocent of this Matter, had been, it seems, Guilty of Wickednesses of other sorts, black enough.</HI></P>
<P>This Folly of theirs, came at last to such a Hight, that it could be no longer Concealed, for it became the publick Discourse, That they had been Guilty not of Murder and Piracy only, but of Un∣common Barbarities, and not that only, but that it was particular∣ly on a <HI>Scots</HI> Ship, and <HI>Scots</HI> Men, <HI>viz.</HI> Captain <HI>Drummond,</HI> as aforesaid.</P>
<P>At length it was brought to the Ears of the Government, and as the publick Justice of all Nations is obliged to take Cognisance of such Horrid Things as were here suggested, the Fellows were Exa∣mined, and they frankly Confessing, <HI>Green</HI> and five of his Men were taken up; The positive Evidence were only two <HI>Negroes,</HI> but others so Corroborated what they said, and Circumstances con∣curring, to make almost every Body believe the Fact, at least in that Hurry, they were upon a long Hearing severally found Guilty of Piracy and Murder.</P>
<P>There are sometimes such Crisis, such Junctures in Matters, when all Things shall concur to possess, not a Man, but even a Nation with a Belief, of what at another Time they would not believe, even upon the same Evidence; And, <HI>in this,</HI> Man seems acted by a kind of supernatural Influence, as if invisibly directed, to bring to pass some particular Thing pointed out by Providence to be done, for Reasons of his own, and known only to his Inscrutable Wisdom.</P>
<P>Just such a Case this seemed to be; the Circumstances of <HI>Green</HI> and his Crew, were very Unhappy for them; Their being put into <HI>Scotland,</HI> where they had no manner of Business, no Distress to Force them in; Their being Seized by the Company, the Mens fal∣ling out among themselves, and being the open Instruments of De∣tecting, what no one ever could ha' Charged them with, their stay∣ing there when they might have gone, and had no more Business there, from whence some alledge, they had no power to depart; These, and more concurring Circumstances which were observed by the most curious, and some of which were Noted upon the Trial, seem'd to Jump together so visibly, that all People seem'd to acknowledge a wonderful and invisible Hand in it, directing and pointing out the Detecting some Horrible Crime, which Ven∣geance suffered not to go Unpunished.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="81"/>
Nor was this the sense of a few, but Generally speaking of the whole Nation, I mean of considering People, and such as usually notice such Things, and particularly of many of those who cried out loudest of the matter, when it was too late to apply any Re∣medy, in which, I cannot but think, they act Unkindly to their Country, and indeed very Unjustly, since, when the Conviction of such Circumstances was on the minds of the People, It is no wonder the Men were found Guilty by the Jury; and I perswade my self, they themselves would have done the same.</P>
<P>On their being found Guilty, they were not immediately Executed, but several Applications were made to <HI>England</HI> for their Reprive; the Council of <HI>Scotland</HI> Reprived them for some Days; And as some People began then to object, That the Evidence was but too slight, and that there was but one Witness to matter of Fact, and that the one Witness was but a <HI>Negroe,</HI> That he was not capable of the Impressions of the Solemnity of an Oath, That there was Malice in it, and the like; On these, and other Considerations, the Govern∣ment was so Tender of the Blood of the Men, that some have thought they had not Died, but for the Rage of the Common People, who hearing that they were further to be Reprived, got together in an unusual Multitude, on the Day appointed for their Execution, crying out for Justice.</P>
<P>And this part of the Story, is the Occasion of my relating so much of it, since the Tendency it had to Inflame the Nations one against another, began here.</P>
<P>On the Day appointed for Execution, the Privy Council was Set, and the Magistrates of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> were called to Assist—, where the Point was Debated, Whether the Condemned Persons should be Executed, or no; I will not say the Rabble Influenc'd the Council in their Determinations that way—; But this is certain, That the Discontent of the Common People was very well known, and that they were Furiously bent upon some Violent Methods, was very much feared—; That a vast Concourse of People was ga∣thered at that Instant in the Parliament Closs, at the Cross, at the Prison, and throughout the whole City, that they publickly Threat∣ned the Magistrates, and even the Council it self, in case they were not brought out that Day, and some talked of pulling down the Tolbooth, which if they had Attempted, they would have Sa∣crificed them in a way more like that of <HI>De Wit,</HI> than an Executi∣on of Justice.</P>
<P>However, it was the Council Determined the matter, that Three of them, <HI>viz.</HI> The Captain <HI>Thomas Green, John Mather,</HI> and <HI>James Simpson,</HI> who were thought to be Principals in the Murder, should be put to Death that Day.</P>
<P>When the Magistrates of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> came out, they assured the People, That they were Ordered to be Executed, and that if they would have a little patience, they would see them brought out; and this pacified them for the present.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="82"/>
Soon after the Council breaking up, My Lord Chancellor came out, and driving down the Street in his Coach, as he past by the Cross, some Body said aloud, <HI>The Magistrates had but cheated them, and that the Council had repriv'd the Criminals</HI>—; This run∣ning like Wild-fire was spread in a Moment among the People; immediately they ran in a Fury down the Street after the Chancellor, stopt his Coach just at the <HI>Trone-Church,</HI> broke the Glasses, abused his Servants, and forc't him out of the Coach; some Friends that were concerned for the Hazard he was in, got him into a House, so that he had no personal Hurt: 'twas in Vain for his Lordship to protest to them that the Men were ordered to be executed, they were then past Hearing of any Thing, the whole Town was in an Up∣roar, and not the Mob of the City, but even from all the Adjacent Countrey was come together, Nothing, but the Blood of the Prison∣ers could appease them: and had not the Execution followed imme∣diately, it cannot be express'd, what Mischief might have hap∣pened.</P>
<P>At last the Prisoners were brought out, and led through the Streets down to <HI>Leith,</HI> the Place of Execution, being by the Laws appointed there for Crimes committed upon the Sea—; The Fury and Rage of the People was such, that it is not to be exprest, and hardly did they suffer them to pass, or keep their Hands off from them as they went, but throw a thousand Insults, Taunts and Revilings; they were at last brought to the Gibbet erected at the Sea-Mark, and there hang'd.</P>
<P>Nor can I forget to Note, that no sooner was the Sacrifice made, and the Men dead, but even the same Rabble, so fickle is the Multi∣tude, exclaim'd at their own Madness, and openly regrated what they had done, and were ready to tear one another to pieces for the Excess.</P>
<P>This was not acted there with more Fury, than it was with the outmost Indignation resented in <HI>England</HI>—, still I am to be un∣derstood of the common People; For the Government of neither Side had any Resentment or Dispute, all things having been carried on by legal Methods, Process and Tryal, according to the Form of Law and Usage of the Country.</P>
<P>But here was new Matter for the Enemies of both Nations to work upon, and too much Fewel was thrown into the Fire of National Contention on both Sides.</P>
<P>In <HI>Scotland</HI> it was said the Court of <HI>England</HI> would protect them, and they would be pardon'd, <HI>only because they were</HI> Scots-<HI>Men that were murdered;</HI> And the like.</P>
<P>In <HI>England</HI> it was said, the Rabble had cry'd out to hang them, be∣cause they were <HI>English-men,</HI> that they had said they wisht they could hang the whole Nation so, and that they insulted them as they went to Execution with the Name of <HI>English</HI> Dogs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Never was such an unfortunate Circumstance to exasperate the common People on both Sides, and to fill them with irreconcile∣able <PB N="48" REF="83"/><GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/><PB N="49" REF="84"/><GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/><PB N="50" REF="85"/>
Aversions that might prepare them for Blood, and if in <HI>England</HI> it had gone a little higher, it would not have been safe for a <HI>Scots</HI> Man to have walk't the Street.</P>
<P>Certain it is, that tho the Men had been innocent, <HI>for that was now alledged,</HI> yet as they were condemned by a due Course of Law, Tryed and Executed by the common Form of Justice in that Coun∣try, and in the same manner by which their own Subjects were tryed and executed, the Fault must ly in the Witnesses and the Jury that believ'd them; But there could be no pretence to make it a National Quarrel at all.</P>
<P>That in <HI>England</HI> it had been but too frequent to Try and Con∣demn innocent Men, and that if Evidences swore the Fact, it might be the Misfortune of any innocent Man to fall under such a Disast∣er, the Crime lay in the Villany and Perjury of Witnesses, but the Nation could not be quarrelled on that Account.</P>
<P>But still these Things left a Corroded Mass of ill Blood in the Minds of the People on either Side, &amp; as Improved by the Malitious Fomenters of our Divisions, they were very Unhappy at that Time.</P>
<P>To Exasperate the People yet more, it was reported, That Cap∣tain <HI>Drummond</HI> was yet Living, that neither he, nor any of his Men was ever Touch't by <HI>Green</HI> or his Crew, and some Seamen who Landed in <HI>England,</HI> made <HI>Affidavit</HI> directly contrary to the Evidence that Hang'd them.</P>
<P>I shall no further enter into the Merits of the Case, than serves to the matter of National Heats—; The Thing was Generally, thought to be a hasty Execution, but the Argument, That it ought to be no Ground of a National Quarrel, prevailed in <HI>England,</HI> and the rest of the Prisoners in <HI>Scotland</HI> were Reprived from Time to Time, and at last let go.</P>
<P>In both these Cases, the Mischiefs of Tumult and Rabbles is to be observed, and how easie it is to set Nations on a flame, by the Violent Fomenting the Passions and Humours of the People, and how much those sort of Men are to be Detested, who blow the Coals of Strife and Dissention in a Nation, prompt the Fury of an Enraged Multitude to Fly in one anothers Faces, and Insult the Laws and Governments of both Countrys at once.</P>
<P>The End of this Account, is to make out what I at first Noted, concerning the Causes which wrought these two Nations up to such a Necessity of a Union, that either it must have been a Union or a War, the Animosities on both Sides being raised to such a pitch, that they could no longer have remained in the usual <HI>Me∣dium</HI> of Peace—; Nor was this Unhappy Story, the least cause of the growing Aversion between us, which was now come to a very great Hight.</P>
<P>The second Head, to which I ascribe the growing Alienation be∣tween these two Kingdoms, was the Act of Security in <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>This Act made a great Noise in the World, and was magnified in <HI>England,</HI> to such a Hight, that it was look'd upon as in effect a Declaration of War, to Commence at the Queen's Demise, and
<PB N="51" REF="86"/>
however designed, was effectually made so, by what after hap∣pened.</P>
<P>The Marquiss of <HI>Tweeddale</HI> was High Commissioner to this Par∣liament, a Person of Extraordinary Temper, Candor and Mo∣desty—; The matter of the Succession had in the preceeding Parliament been rejected, on this Supposition, That it was not Pru∣dent for <HI>Scotland</HI> to Joyn with <HI>England,</HI> except such Conditions of Commerce and Navigation were first obtained by Treaty with <HI>England,</HI> as were Just and Honourable for <HI>Scotland,</HI> and abundance of Honest Gentlemen, who were far enough from so much as being suspected of Favouring the Jacobite Interest, joyned together in this Demand; They were willing to come into the Succession, pro∣vided they had such and such Conditions, as they thought were reasonable to be insisted on in behalf of <HI>Scotland,</HI> among which the Liberty and Freedom of Trade to the <HI>English</HI> Plantations was one—.</P>
<P>There were many very Learned Debates in the preceeding Par∣liament upon this Head; Great and Popular Speeches made on the Subject—, and the Act of Security was offered, and Voted, but could not then be past, for Things began to run high in the Parliament, which occasioned a Recess.</P>
<P>This was taken in <HI>England</HI> in a most Hainous manner, and no∣thing was now talked of there, but the <HI>Scots</HI> Buying Arms and Am∣munition, Training and Exercising their Men, and Mighty Things were suggested in <HI>England,</HI> which the <HI>Scots might do,</HI> and some∣times which they <HI>would do;</HI> The Printed News Papers gave a most Formidable Journal of the Duke of <HI>Athole</HI> drawing out his High∣landers, Encamping three Days with Seven Thousand Men, how Armed, how well Officer'd, and the like; Another Paper told the World of Sixty Thousand Men in <HI>Scotland,</HI> Arm'd and Train'd, and ready to take the Field.</P>
<P>However absurd these Things were, and that Wiser Men who knew the State of <HI>Scotland,</HI> saw there was nothing in it, but what every Nation in the World would have done in the like case, that it was neither more nor less than Arming their Militia, and put∣ting them into some Order, which, for several years past had been intirely neglected, yet I say, However absurd the Suggestions were, they were Improved in <HI>England</HI> to all manner of Extremes, and some most ridiculous Excesses were run into, both publick and private.</P>
<P>It is, no doubt, but as <HI>Scotland</HI> was acknowledged to be Inde∣pendent, whatever the forward Pens of our Politicians would have pretended, yet I say, being acknowledged Independent even by the <HI>English</HI> Parliament, it was a very material Thing to have Her Concur in Establishing the Succession of the Crown, on the same Person, as <HI>England</HI> had done.</P>
<P>Two Things mov'd in this Affair on the <HI>English</HI> Side.<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Some would not have it done at all, and therefore were for Irritating the <HI>English</HI> against the <HI>Scots,</HI> that it might come to a Rupture in stead of a Settlement, and this by putting it
<PB N="52" REF="87"/>
upon <HI>Scotland</HI> to Declare, without a previous Treaty, which they knew would never be accepted.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Others would gladly have had the <HI>Scots</HI> come into the Suc∣cession, but were willing to have them do it without any Con∣ditions, thinking that <HI>Scotland</HI> ought still be kept Low, for fear of their Principles, which lead them to be no Friends to the <HI>English</HI> Church Establishment.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Both these cried out, and Exclaim'd at this Act of Security, and represented it to the World, as if the <HI>Scots</HI> were going actually to separate from <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>There was one Clause in the Act of Security, which intirely Ex∣cluded the Successor to the Crown from Governing both Kingdoms together.</P>
<P>This the Enemies of <HI>Scotland</HI> presently Represented in <HI>England,</HI> as a Design to Restore King <HI>James,</HI> and a great many Honest People were brought in to believe, that the <HI>Scots</HI> even the Presbyterians themselves, were so alienated from <HI>England,</HI> and so obstinately bent against joyning with her on any account, that they would ne∣ver again be under the same Head, nay that they would rather League themselves with <HI>France,</HI> and restore King <HI>James,</HI> than come to any Terms with her. And this was as it were confirmed when the <HI>Scots</HI> subsequent to these things passed an Act for Trading with <HI>France,</HI> tho' as their Circumstances then stood, it was very necessary to them.</P>
<P>Nor was this run to any thing less in <HI>England,</HI> and they began to talk loudly there of <HI>forcing the</HI> Scots <HI>to the Succession;</HI> But this was by such as either coveted a Breach between the two Nations u∣pon any Terms, or really did not understand what they said. The latter appeared by their printing some Pieces to prove the Right of the House of <HI>Hannover</HI> to the Crown by Succession, a Thing all People that kno' any thing of the Affairs of <HI>Europe,</HI> kno' it was the Foun∣dation upon which the present Establishment pretends to be built—, But on that much safer, and much more Divine Right of the <HI>English</HI> Constitution, and <HI>Scots</HI> also, I mean Parliamentary Limita∣tion.</P>
<P>Things ran very high now in both Nations, the Measures ta∣ken in <HI>Scotland</HI> seem'd to be very well grounded, and their Aim well taken, for either <HI>England</HI> must comply with <HI>Scotland,</HI> as to such Treaties as were reasonable, or else she might have the Satis∣faction to see clearly <HI>Scotland</HI> by this Act was plac't in an intire separate State from her, who she wou'd joyn with, what Prince she wou'd bring in, where she would bestow her Crown, was not to the purpose; Two Things she had made plain.<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That she was resolved to have it wholly in her own Hands, to bestow as she thought fit.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That wherever the <HI>English</HI> Crown was bestowed, the <HI>Scots</HI> Crown should not without Conditions be obtain'd.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>This effectually Settled and Declar'd the Independency of <HI>Scot∣land,</HI>

and put her into a Posture fit to be treated with, either by <HI>England,</HI> or by any other Nation.</P>
<P>Nor did the Apprehensions which this gave the World of the <HI>Scots</HI> designing to restore King <HI>James</HI> do her any Disservice, for tho' nothing is more certain than that the <HI>Jacobites as they are called,</HI> conceived great Hopes from these Things, and flattered themselves exceedingly, that the Return of their King, <HI>as they called him,</HI> would be the Effect of all these Breaches; And therefore fell in heartily with all these Things, and as far as possible carried on the A∣version to a Settlement with <HI>England;</HI> Yet it is as certain, that the Gentlemen who mainly carried on this Project, had no more Eye that way than to the Great <HI>Turk,</HI> but were sincerely bent to the Prosperity of their Country, and the Establishment both Religious and Civil, as fully appeared afterwards by their heartily pursuing the Treaty that followed.</P>
<P>The Drift of the whole Matter was, the bringing <HI>England</HI> to Terms, bringing the <HI>English</HI> Nation to a Treaty, and tho' it is con∣fest that the Prospect was Remote and Melancholly, <HI>England</HI> at the time being averse to any such thing; yet as these Gentlemen saw there was no other way to redeem <HI>Scotland</HI> from the Discourage∣ment she then lay under, with respect to the Absence of her Court, the Dependance of her Gentry and Nobility, the Limitations and Restrictions of Trade, which by the Act of Navigation she was fet∣tered with, and several Disadvantages her present Conjunction, <HI>which was made without any Treaty</HI> laid her under—, and therefore they stood strictly and resolutely to their Measures, and the more the Court in <HI>England</HI> pusht at her joyning in the Settlement, and used all possible means to bring it to pass, the more averse they appeared, and the farther they went off from it.</P>
<P>Thus I say this Act of Security being only attempted in the first Session of Parliament, was perfected in the next, and every day fur∣ther and further Advances were made seemingly to an entire and lasting Separation of the Kingdoms from one another.</P>
<P>There were other Steps made to this on both Sides as to Matters of Trade, as shall appear immediately.</P>
<P><HI>England</HI> who was all this while under a very unhappy Conduct, and acted upon quite different Foundations, from what we have seen her happily brought over to since, took the worst Measures upon the <HI>Scots</HI> Proceedings then, that ever a wise People could have taken; For the <HI>English</HI> Parliament sitting soon after, <HI>viz.</HI> 1704. the <HI>Scots</HI> Act of Security came to be considered, and however influenc't by a pre∣cipitant Party, <HI>God only knows,</HI> they past an Act in my Opinion the most Impolitick, I had almost said unjust, that ever past that great Assembly.</P>
<P>This was that Act of Parliament, Intituled, <HI>An Act to prevent the Mischiefs arising to</HI> England <HI>from the Act of Security in</HI> Scotland. In which they in a manner declar'd open War with <HI>Scotland,</HI> unless by the 24th of <HI>Decemb.</HI> the next year they should settle the Crown in the
<PB N="54" REF="89"/>
same Person as now settled in <HI>England</HI>—; For they appointed 24 Men of War to be fitted out, to prevent the <HI>Scots</HI> Trading with <HI>France,</HI> declared the <HI>Scots</HI> in <HI>England</HI> Aliens, and several other Ar∣ticles, as in the Act it self may more at large appear.</P>
<P>This was done in that famous Parliament, called, <HI>The Tacking Parliament,</HI> and it was the less to be wondred at, Because, <HI>which is the Subject I am at present upon,</HI> the Heats between the Nations, which were at this time improv'd by the Parties on both Sides, were risen to a very great Hight, all things tended to Exasperations and Provocations, no Man of Temper seemed to show himself on either Hand, and those who bore the least Regard to the general Good of both Kingdoms, foresaw nothing but an unavoidable War between us; And indeed had Matters stood thus but a very little longer, it had been impossible to have avoided it, and that in a most unseason∣able time for <HI>Europe,</HI> which was then engaged in the most furious and most critical Juncture of the War with <HI>France,</HI> being the year before the Battle at <HI>Blenheim.</HI></P>
<P>Thus the Party in <HI>Scotland</HI> who had laid their Scheme, in hopes that <HI>England</HI> would have come into Measures for the general Good, saw themselves disappointed; and tho' its true, that had <HI>England</HI> then seen with the Eyes of her National Understanding, and had she not been ridden by a Party who openly pursued the Ruine of her ve∣ry Constitution, I mean as establish't on the Revolution Principle, I say, had she not been under that unhappy Influence, she had taken other Measures, yet as it was, nothing was to be expected.</P>
<P>However, the Gentlemen in <HI>Scotland</HI> happily resolved to wait for the Issue of Things, and firmly adhered to their new Scheme; <HI>Scotland</HI> began to be talk'd up in the World a little, and these very Enemies who, <HI>as they thought,</HI> wounded her by talking up the mighty formidable Things this Act of Security might produce, really rais∣ed her Reputation; nothing was more absurd, than their allarming <HI>England</HI> at the <HI>Chimeras</HI> of their own Heads, such as <HI>Scotlands</HI> buying 30000 stand of Arms in <HI>Holland,</HI> laying in 10000 Barrels of Pow∣der, arming 60000 Men, and the like, all which in Reality was no∣thing at all but mustering their Train'd-bands, <HI>as they call them in</HI> England, and buying about 500 Barrels of Powder for the Castle of <HI>Edinburgh.</HI> In their allarming <HI>England</HI> I say, at these mighty things, they really raised the Reputation of <HI>Scotland</HI> in the World, and made her begin to make a different Figure in the Eyes of other Nati∣ons, and there is no doubt had things gone on to a Rupture, as wic∣ked Men on both Sides wished, and good Men began to fear, <HI>Scot∣land</HI> might have found some powerful Princes willing to have accep∣ted her Crown, and to have in the mean time Supported, Supplyed and Encourag'd her to stand upon her own Feet.</P>
<P>But I'll do the Gentlemen who Managed this Affair, this Justice, that I believe they had it not at all in their Design, to fly to the Protection of any Foreign Power, no not to any Protestant Power
<PB N="55" REF="90"/>
in <HI>Europe,</HI> unless Forc'd to it by the precipitant Measures <HI>England</HI> was then in all probability going into; and if they had done it then, I can not see how they could have been blam'd—. But as to the present State of Things, the Gentlemen who Managed this Part, seem'd to me, always to aim at obliging <HI>England</HI> to give them good Terms, and to put themselves in such a Posture in the World, as should make <HI>England</HI> see, it was worth their while to do so, as well as that they ought to do so; And this was so just a Step, and the Aim so well taken, as by the Consequence appeared, that I think, 'tis the greatest Panegyrick that can be made on those Gentlemen, to say, They brought to pass by it, all the great Things which GOD in his Providence has thought fit to do towards our Peace and Happiness in this Island.</P>
<P>If they did not design this, or had not this Honest Aim in View, they less deserve the Praise; but it is evident, Providence made their Measures Instrumental to bring it to pass.</P>
<P>Thus stood the Affairs of this Island, at the End of the Year 1705, when the Aversions between the two Kingdoms, by the several Steps I have noticed, was come to a great Hight, the People seem'd Ex∣asperated against one another to the highest Degree, the Governments seem'd bent to act Counter to one another in all their Councils; Trade Clash't between them in all its Circumstances, and every Par∣liament run further and further into the most disobliging Things that could be: <HI>England</HI> laid a new Impost upon <HI>Scots</HI> Cloth; <HI>Scotland</HI> Prohibited all the <HI>English</HI> Woollen Manufacture in General, and Erected Manufacturies among themselves, which, had they been prudently Managed too, might have been very Advantageous to them; But, <HI>of that by the way. Scotland</HI> freely and openly Ex∣ported their Wool to <HI>France, Germany</HI> and <HI>Sweden,</HI> to the irre∣parable Loss of the <HI>English</HI> Manufactures, having great Quantities of <HI>English</HI> Wool brought into <HI>Scotland</HI> over the Borders, which, it was impossible for <HI>England</HI> to prevent; So that the Famous Trade for Wool to <HI>France</HI> by <HI>Rumney Marsh, commonly called Owling,</HI> was intirely Dropt, and <HI>France</HI> not Supplyed only, but Glutted with Wool.</P>
<P>On the other hand, <HI>England</HI> was proceeding to Prohibite the Importation of <HI>Scots</HI> Cattel, and to interrupt by Force their Trade with <HI>France,</HI> and had this last proceeded to Practice, all the World could not have prevented a War between both Nations.</P>
<P>But more prudent Counsels prevailed, and GOD's Providence Unravelled all these Schemes of Destruction, which mad Men had drawn for the Ruine of their Native Country; And as many times Things evil in their Design, are Over-ruled by an Invisible Hand, and bring to pass that very Good, which they were prepar'd to De∣stroy; Even so it was here, for these Confusions were the very Things that brought both the Nations to their Senses, I mean, brought them both to better Temper—; The consequences of a Bloody War just breaking out in the Bowels of their Native Coun∣trey, in the Ruine and certain Desolation of which they must ne∣cessarily
<PB N="56" REF="91"/>
have a great Share, opened the Eyes of the most thinking People on both Sides, even of those who in themselves had no real inclination to the Conjunction of the Kingdoms, and thus the Ne∣cessity of taking new Measures began to appear both ways.</P>
<P>In <HI>England,</HI> the Weight of the present War which every Day rather Increased than Decreased; In <HI>Scotland,</HI> their declining Con∣dition and Disunited Circumstances; in <HI>England,</HI> the matter of Se∣curity in <HI>Scotland,</HI> the prospect of Advantage, all concurred to sway the Inclinations of Wise-men to heal these Breaches.</P>
<P>I have now shown by what Steps these two Nations were brought to the very Brink of mutual Destruction, and the Sequel of the Story will tell any body, who were the Parties that prompted both Nations to these Unhappy Extremes: I shall in the next place a little Examine how all this Tide of Mischief and Folly turned, and how they began to come to themselves in both Kingdoms, and this will so naturally lead us to the History of the Union, that I can not think of a more proper Introduction.</P>
<P>The Party in <HI>England</HI> who had the Reins of the Administration in their Hands, had given other Testimonies than this of their precipitant Measures, and as they had made not this Nation only Uneasie, but their own too, so as Things Generally take new Turns, when they come to Extremes, the <HI>English</HI> Nation began to be Allarm'd at the Proceedings, as tending to the Subversion of all the Fabrick of Government erected by the Revolution.</P>
<P>The occasion of all this, is too long to relate here, and the History of the Tacking the Occasional-Bill to the Money-Bill in that Par∣liament in <HI>England,</HI> is too well known, to need any Recital. It is enough to say here, That pushing at such Hot Measures in <HI>England,</HI> as is usual in all Precipitations, like an Ax struck upon a hard Stone, the Blow rebounded, and the Weapon flew out of the Hand of the Unskilful Workman—; the Project fail'd, the Party Overthrew themselves, and never Recover'd.</P>
<P>The Queen, far from approving the Extravagancies they were running Things to, and awakned by the Danger of her Peoples Li∣berties, which were as dear to her self as to them, finding to what Mischiefs these Warm Gentlemen were leading her, and being by the goodness of her Disposition, as well as Experience in the <HI>English</HI> Affairs, particularly Averse to Things Hard or Severe upon her People, much more so to all manner of illegal Severities—, put a full stop to this Career of Mischief—. And tho' indeed they had brought Things to the very Edge of Destruction both in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> on their own Business, as well as in the Affairs of the two Kingdoms, yet the Queen immediately shifting Hands, and Ap∣plying with her usual Wisdom, to the Establishing the Minds of her People, Retriv'd this whole Affair, restor'd <HI>England</HI> to the Tranquillity so much desired, filled up her Ministry, and all Offices of Trust, with Men of the same Candor and Moderation with her self, openly Abandoned and Discouraged the Measures of those People, who had run Things to such Excesses, and Re-settled the
<PB N="57" REF="92"/>
Minds of her People, Distracted with Apprehensions of Ruine and Party-Confusion.</P>
<P>Thus the Ministry in <HI>England</HI> was intirely Changed, the Lord Keeper, Sir <HI>Nathan Wright</HI> Deposed, Sir <HI>Edward Seymour</HI> Compt∣roller of the Houshold put out of Her Family, the Earl of <HI>Not∣tinghame</HI> Secretary of State, and several others laid aside; the Props of the High-flying Party, <HI>as they were called,</HI> were left out of the Council, and removed from their Places in the Government.</P>
<P>In the several Countries, the Peoples Approbation of Her Majesties Proceedings, and their Joy at this Change of Instruments, was testi∣fied by the Universal Contempt put upon the Affair of the Tacking; and of the Occasional-Bill, as well as of all Hot Men and Hot-Measures; and this testified by the Change in their Elections of Parliament-men, a new Parliament being then to be Chosen, in which so General an Aversion to the Occasional-Bill, or any thing Invading the Toleration, and particularly to the Affair of the Tack appeared, that in spight of all Oppositions a great number of the Tacking Members were thrown out, and such a Change of Men appeared in the next Parliament, that whereas in the other Parlia∣ment, the High-Party had a Majority of Sixty Two or there about, for every Thing they joyn'd in; On the first Tryal of the Strength of the House, which was perhaps the Greatest that has been known of late Years, it appear'd the Whig-Party had the Majority by above Seventy Voices, and these by the turning out severals on the Trials of Elections, and other Circumstances, rose up to be above a Hundred, tho' after they seem'd to lose some Ground again, but it did not last.</P>
<P>Things being thus happily turned in <HI>England,</HI> and the first Step for the Establishing and Settling this new Party in their Seats of Management taken, it was wonderful to see the Change it made in all the Affairs of the Nation, how every Thing succeeded, unheard of Victories Abroad, unusual Chearfulness at Home, and a new Face of Prosperity seem'd to Guild the Affairs of the Nation, the Feuds of Parties died in every place; Peace, Union, and Temper began to be the Companion of every Society, and the Ancient Animosities between Neighbour and Neighbour, between Friend and Friend, which formerly crept, <HI>not into Society only,</HI> but even into our Families, and our very Beds, declined a pace; The Queen Encouraged Peace and Love, and Unity among her People, and pressed the Nation to it upon all Occasions, and all Good Men began to Encourage it by their Examples.</P>
<P>In this General Felicity of Affairs in <HI>England, Scotland</HI> came into Remembrance; Her Majesty as having an equal Regard to the Good of all Her Subjects, and as being justly Concerned, not for the Change of the Temper and Condition of Her People only, but for the Continuance of it to them in Ages to come, could not but be Solicitous for the removing the Obstructions which lay in the way on either Side.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="93"/>
When the Wisest Heads in both Nations had been Consulted with on this Article, tho' Opinions differ'd, yet no <HI>Medium</HI> could ever be found so Effectual to secure this Peace, and remove all possibility of a Fracture, like renewing the Treaty of Union.</P>
<P>And thus I am brought down to the General Article of the Trea∣ty, by the meer Threed of the Story, the Feuds of Parties, the Folly of Statesmen, the Fury of Rabbles, and the General Revi∣ving of the old Animosities between the People, had been Screwed up to a dangerous Hight, as is Noted already, by that very Party, who had on all Occasions, shown themselves Enemies to the present Establishment, and future Peace even of both Nations, and by this Method, they thought they had rendred the Succession to both Crowns Impracticable for the House of <HI>Hannover,</HI> and secured an inevitable Rupture between the Nations, when ever it should please GOD to Remove Her Majesty out of this World.</P>
<P>But great are the Wonders of Inscrutable Providence, these very Schemes contrived in the Deeps of Infernal Malice, Brooded on by that Party who ever Envied the Liberty of Protestants, and the Tranquility as well as Privileges Enjoy'd by the People of this whole Island, and Hatch'd by the warm Influence of a reigning Party, by which they Flattered themselves, They had effectually Overthrown the Project of a Union of the Kingdoms, made their Coalition Impossible, and all Schemes projected for it Impracti∣cable; I say, these very Things made way for that same Union, they were Calculated to Destroy.</P>
<P>The Hight those Measures I have been speaking of, was brought to, made, as it were, a Force upon both Nations to come to this Treaty.</P>
<P>It was now but a few Months to come, when the Nations must di∣rectly fall out, <HI>English</HI> Men of War must be fitted out to cruise upon the <HI>Scots,</HI> and we that consented, or at least did not scruple to have the <HI>Dutch</HI> carry on a free Trade with <HI>France,</HI> must go &amp; fight with our own Brethren for it—; Whereas, had we been in our Trading Sen∣ses, we would have done it our selves.</P>
<P>The Crisis things were come to now, was such, that they could no longer stand at a Stay, but we must fall out with the <HI>Scots,</HI> or unite with them, all Methods to bring them to settle the Succession without a Treaty had been in vain used by the Party before, who would gladly have Tricked them into it, but the <HI>Scots</HI> were too wise to fall into that Snare.</P>
<P>The present Ministry were for fairer Dealings with them at the same time, wisely concluding, that to gain of the <HI>Scots</HI> what they ought to grant, it was reasonable to grant to the <HI>Scots</HI> what they ought to have—, and that a Treaty with them might be made ef∣fectual, the only way was to set about it, upon an honest Foot, and then pursue it sincerely, and not upon Sharping and Tricking on either Side as before.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="94"/>
But there yet seemed to ly one invincible Obstruction in the way of this Treaty, and that was the Act of Parliament passed in <HI>England</HI> the last Session, which, as before noted, had declared a kind of War against the <HI>Scots,</HI> in case they did not come into the Succession by such a Day; And upon the first Motion to a Treaty, the <HI>Scots</HI> de∣clared they could not enter into any Treaty with <HI>England,</HI> till that Act was Repealed.</P>
<P>This had indeed a great deal of Reason in it, and such as could not be withstood, for the Honour of the <HI>Scots</HI> seemed very much impaired in that Act, and that they could not come to a Treaty u∣pon equal Terms while such a Law stood in force upon them, which seem'd as if it had been a Sword over their Heads drawn to awe them into a Treaty.</P>
<P>The Queen, who was resolved if possible to bring this great Event to pass, and who strove to do it so, as might give all Her Subjects Satisfaction, undertook to clear up this Difficulty, and at the next Parliament which met in <HI>England, Octob.</HI> 23. 1706, in Her Speech to both Houses, Recommended the taking away of this Obstruction, by Repealing that Act, in order to introduce a Treaty of Union, which Her Majesty saw now more clearly in view than ever be∣fore.</P>
<P>I know there were strong Struggles in <HI>England</HI> against Repealing this Act, and that chiefly without Doors, the Party foreseeing, that if this Step was taken in Parliament, the Union which they really dreaded would of course come upon the Stage, to this end it was re∣presented as Dishonourable to make such an Advance to the <HI>Scots:</HI> That it was an Insulting of <HI>England</HI> to have the <HI>Scots</HI> say, they would not Treat with her till such and such Conditions were per∣formed—; That this was letting the <HI>Scots</HI> prescribe Prelimi∣naries upon <HI>England,</HI> and if <HI>England</HI> complyed, it would make them more Encroaching.</P>
<P>But the Temper in the Parliament was quite different from this, it was plain there that the <HI>Scots</HI> were in the Right to ask this as a Preliminary, that the Treaty would for ever be subject to this Ob∣jection, that it was not free, but done under the Terror or Force of that Act of Parliament, that as it was not Honourable for the <HI>Scots</HI> to have a Treaty forced upon them under such Circumstances; So neither was it Honourable for <HI>England</HI> to force a Treaty upon them, that the Act was unreasonable in its own Nature, that <HI>En∣gland</HI> could have no pretence but meer Violence to intermeddle with the <HI>Scots</HI> Commerce, who were a free Nation, and ought to be at Liberty to Trade with any Nation that they thought fit to Trade with, that their Trade with <HI>France</HI> was done by their own Act of Parliament passed by the Queen, and was not inconsistent with, or contraveening any Treaty or Contract with <HI>England,</HI> that <HI>Scotland</HI> was under no Treaty of Commerce, or under no Ob∣ligation to Trade, or not to Trade as <HI>England</HI> did; That as to the Confederacy, and the War in which they were embark't with <HI>Eng∣gland,</HI>
<PB N="60" REF="95"/>
that laid them under no Obligation, since the <HI>Dutch</HI> were in the same Confederacy, and yet openly proclaimed a free Trade with <HI>France;</HI> Nor did the <HI>English</HI> pretend to obstruct them in it; That <HI>Scotland</HI> was as Independent of the <HI>English</HI> Government as the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and ought to be at liberty to Trade unmolested as well as they.</P>
<P>These Arguments back't with an Administration of Government now quite recovered from the Tyrannical Principles of those former∣ly in Power, soon influenc't the Parliament to Repeal the Act, and take this Step by way of advance to the Scots, by which they let the <HI>Scots</HI> see they were in the hands of their Friends, that now they might expect fair Dealings, and had Room to Treat with Freedom and Honour.</P>
<P>This was a great Mortification to those Gentlemen who had pro∣moted that Act, who now together with their whole Party, set them∣selves with all their Artifice to oppose the Treaty in all its Parts in both Kingdoms; to raise Scruples, imprint Jealousies, Misrepresent Persons and Things, embroil Councils, raise Scandals, and in short to do every manner of thing they could to embarrass and obstruct the Treaty: And in the first place to prejudice the Minds of the com∣mon People against the Union as such. What fatal Success they had, how they carryed it on, even beyond the Conclusion of the Treaty, with what Difficulties it was encountred, how begun, how carried on, how finished, and how since assaulted, and with difficulty enough preserved, will be the Subject of the ensuing Sheets.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Last TREATY, PROPERLY CALLED THE UNION;</HEAD>
<HEAD>And, first, Of the Treaty in <HI>London.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I Am now come to the Great and Capital Treaty, which has at last, by the Blessing of GOD, been brought to a Happy Con∣clusion.—</P>
<P>I am not Insensible, That, in the strange Variety of Circumstan∣ces, Changes of Prospects, the Turns of Management, the Acci∣dents and Niceties, with which it has been carryed on, the Infinite Difficulties the Zealous Promoters of it met with, the Restless At∣tacks of a Strong Party to Disappoint it, who never gave over their Struggle, no not even after it was done: In this Labyrinth of Untrode Paths, I may easily misplace some things, and omit others; and I cannot but Introduce my Account of it with this Cau∣tion, that tho' I believe no Man can have Collected with more Care, nor has had the Opportunity to Remark things with more Advantage, having been Eye Witness to much of the General Transaction, and furnish'd by the best Hands with every most se∣cret Affair in the Carrying it on; yet many Minute Things may have past my Pen, which it is impossible for me to Attone for, but by making this <HI>Proviso,</HI> That the Reader may be assured, nothing Material can have slipp'd me; and I have used all necessary Cauti∣on to furnish my self with the whole Truth of Fact, whatever Omis∣sion of Circumstances I may make an Apology for:</P>
<P>I have already related the Issue of the Treaty begun the first Year of the Queen, and made my Observations of the Reason of its Mis∣carriage: It may be observed, That Her Majesty understanding the true Reasons of the Disappointment, which 'twas thought lay in the Persons Treating, particularly on the <HI>English</HI> Side, whose Disposition to finish it for the Publick Good, it was supposed, did not appear at all to Her Satisfaction, <HI>in which I have further already Explain'd my self,</HI> Obtain'd a New Act of Parliament in <HI>England,</HI> and the like in <HI>Scotland,</HI> Impowering the Queen to Appoint Commissioners on ei∣ther Hand, to Treat of an Union between the Two Nations.—</P>
<P>And here 'tis necessary to observe, how well the Ground Plot of this Work was laid, that all Obstacles might be removed, which might threaten it with another Abortion; It had been noted, that the most Dangerous Rock of Difference, on which this Union could Split, and which could now render it Ineffectual, was that of Religion: Here it was certain they could never Unite, and
<PB N="2" REF="97"/>
the Breach therefore being Irreconcileable, the best Course that could be taken with it, was to let it quite alone as a thing neither side should meddle with at all, and consequently the Jealousies and Sus∣picious on both sides must vanish, and the great Obstructions which the Enemies of the Treaty relyed on for its Miscarriage were at once removed.</P>
<P>This was a Master-Piece of Policy, and shewed, that Her Maje∣sty had other Persons to Consult with, and had taken other Mea∣sures than before, and gave People very early Impressions of the Success which has since appear'd.</P>
<P>But there was yet some Political Difficulty to pass, and here be∣ing to Tread Truth almost on the Heels, those Readers that are willing to have it told plainest, must excuse me for naming Peoples Names: I have avoided, on all Occasions, the Mixing Satyr and Reflection in this Relation, as much as possible.</P>
<P>The Political Difficulties I speak of here, and which I think gave the greatest Shock to this Affair, consist of two Parts,<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Succession.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Nobility.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The Vehemence with which the several Parties, who managed these Topicks, acted their respective and exceedingly remote Pros∣pects; and by what strange Mystery, concurring Providence, like the Wheel within all their Wheels, center'd them all, in Unit∣ing the Nations; as it is a secret History few understood, and may be as Necessary as Diverting, so the Heads of it may be view'd in the following Scheme.<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The Succession being the main thing that lay at the Bot∣tom of every ones Project, I shall first speak to the Particulars of that.
<P>There was a Party in both Kingdoms, but most Powerful in <HI>Scotland,</HI> whose Design was principally and directly against the Protestant Succession as such; These we must allow to be setting every Wheel at Work, and Acting with all their Power and Policy against every thing which look'd that way.</P></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>When they saw it convenient, they acted against an Union in its general Term, and frequently some of the less Politick of that Par∣ty let fall the Excrescence of their Principles in direct Terms, and Pamphlets were wrote upon that Scheme, such as one shewing the Necessities of a War with <HI>England, &amp;c,</HI> another showing the Ad∣vantages of an Union with other Nations, and <HI>France</HI> in particu∣lar; others argued continually the mighty Terms, and the Advan∣tages of Commerce <HI>Scotland</HI> might obtain from <HI>France,</HI> and not only proposed them as Equivalent to the Trade with <HI>England,</HI> but run on to such weak Extremes, as to say, that <HI>Scotland</HI> made no Advantage of her Commerce with <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>But these may well be said to be the less Politick Part of these Gentlemen who were in the Design above, for they lost Ground even against the Union it self by it; and when the Committee of Parliament, Appointed to Examine the Exports and Imports, Re∣ported, That <HI>Scotland</HI> Exported to <HI>England</HI> above 200000 Pounds
<PB N="3" REF="98"/>
<HI>Sterling per Annum</HI> in Linen, Cattel, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the Imports from thence appear'd so small, that the Objectors dropp'd their Arguments upon that Head, and learn'd to talk with more Caution.</P>
<P>But the more Subtile Managers of this Design against the Successi∣on, went on by different Measures, and with great Policy they acted every Party, as far as they thought they could be brought in to be subservient to their Design.</P>
<P>Thus first seeming to quit their direct Opposition to the Successi∣on, as a Thing too open, and too much Clashing with the Temper of the Time, they fall in with that Party, who were for the Succes∣sion with Limitations; Not that they wou'd have concurr'd with the Event, had these Limitations been never so great, but that, in their Debating the Limitations, they might find Room to Clog the Succession it self, in such manner as the other Party could by no Means accept of it.</P>
<P>From the same Principle proceeded that Famous Resolve in their Act of Security, by which the Succession met with two Invincible Obstacles, from whence they knew, some time or other, new Dis∣putes must arise, 1. That no Successor at all should be Named, till after the Queen. 2. That when it was Named, it should be with this Limitation, that it should not be the same that should Succeed to the Kingdom of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>This was a Master-Piece of Policy, and had the most Specious Pretence in the World, <HI>viz.</HI> The Hardships which <HI>Scotland</HI> had suffered under the Influence of <HI>England</HI> in Matters of Commerce and Sovereignty; and therefore it was added immediately upon the said Clause, <HI>Ʋnless that in this Present Session of Parliament, or any other Session of this, or any ensuing Parliament, there be such Conditions of Government Settled and Enacted, as may Secure the Honour and So∣vereignty of this Crown and Kingdom, the Freedom, Frequency and Power of Parliament, the Religion, Liberty and Trade of the Nation from</HI> English, <HI>or any Forreign Influence.</HI> See the Act of Security Print∣ed in the <HI>Appendix</HI> to this Work, <HI>N<SUP>o</SUP>.</HI> (1)</P>
<P>The running things to this Height in <HI>Scotland,</HI> put every Parties Measures to a full Stop; The Gentlemen who were against the Suc∣cession in general, and of whom I am now Treating, had most ef∣fectually carryed their Point; for as they presumed <HI>England</HI> could never come in to such a Treaty as they demanded, so they had effec∣tually foreclosed the Succession of <HI>Hannover,</HI> by Determining, that the Successor of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland</HI> should not be the same.</P>
<P>And 'tis remarkable to note here, how universally all those Gentle∣men, whose Aim was, <HI>Against</HI> the Succession, fell in with those whose Design was only to have Advantageous Terms from <HI>England</HI> for it.</P>
<P>But this very Point gain'd, brought about the main Work, and the Contraries that concurr'd in this Act, tho' from Clashing In∣terests, by the strange Circulation of Causes, work'd all together into another Extreme, which none of them design'd, and that was the Union.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="99"/>
Upon the passing the Act of Security, <HI>England</HI> grew very uneasy, and not to mention the common Apprehensions of the People, nor how, and by whom they were encreased and fomented, the Act of Parliament past, Intituled, <HI>An Act to prevent the Dangers arising from the Act of Security in</HI> Scotland, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is a Demonstration of what the Tendency of these Things would be; For this Act, which I have also, for the better understanding of the Story, Abridg'd and Printed in the <HI>Appendix, N<SUP>o</SUP>.</HI> (2.) brought both Nations under the Necessity of a War by the <HI>Christmass</HI> following; the <HI>English</HI> being then obliged to fit out a Fleet, to interrupt the <HI>Scots</HI> Commerce, if their Act of Security was not Repealed.</P>
<P>Things being brought to this Extremity, the only Remedy that those who wished well to both Nations could contrive, was to re∣vive a Treaty of Union, and set heartily about it,—and the first Step the Queen took towards it, was to propose it to the <HI>Scots</HI> Parliament, who Voted,—<HI>That they could enter into no Treaty of Ʋnion, till that Act of Parliament mentioned above was Repealed in</HI> England.</P>
<P>Tho' this was a very bold Resolve, yet the Queen, who saw some Reasonableness in it, managed Things with so much Wisdom and Moderation; and the Parliament, who saw with differing Eyes from the other, and was of a quite differing Temper, found some∣thing so severe and so hard upon <HI>Scotland</HI> in that Act of Parlia∣ment, that they made no Difficulty to make that Step in Advance to <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>Upon this Foot turn'd the first Appearance of the Union; Now let us see how the Parties managed themselves on all sides.</P>
<P>The Inclination on both sides to an Union, <HI>however afterwards manag'd,</HI> seem'd so universal, That the Party I am speaking of, thought it was not proper to appear against it directly; but acting still under Disguise, they puzzle the Cause, <HI>first,</HI> With the wild Debate of a Federal Union, or an Union Partial and Imperfect;—and thus they fell in with the Party who were for the Union, not that they had the Union in their Design; but because they thought the Thing Impracticable in it self; That it would make the People Sceptick in Government; and that so it would certainly miscarry, and the Succession would be lost that way.</P>
<P>Accordingly the Limitations were by secret Influence opposed, and the Scheme of Succession laid aside to go upon the <HI>Chimera</HI> of an Union, <HI>as they thought it to be;</HI> and I could be very Merry with some Gentlemen here, upon the Banters and Jests they always Treated the Scheme of an Union with, as a Thing they little thought would ever be licked into any Shape, or ever obtain up∣on the Nations to pass into a Law.</P>
<P>Thus I have brought the remotest Party, who were downright Enemies of the Union, to fall into it;—From whence, let their Design be what it will, I must tell them, they did it this Service, that it made the Union <HI>very Popular,</HI> however it came to be otherways afterward.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="100"/>
I come next to the Difficulty about Nobility, and this work'd in to an Union, by, as it were a Natural Consequence; For the Antient Nobility finding their Sway with the People lessen'd, and their Power, as well as their Honour, eclips'd, by the Crown day∣ly Creating Numbers of what <HI>they</HI> called Upstart Lords, were ea∣sily engaged in Limitations, to prevent their Future Monarch's en∣creasing the Numbers of their Rank, to the Diminution, as they took it, of the Antient Families.</P>
<P>But when they came to consider the Scheme of Distinction made for the Representing the Nobility in a <HI>British</HI> Parliament, they were the more easily brought into the Union, as an effectual Step to prevent the Reducing their Honour, by Multiplying their Num∣bers, and as a thing which would seem to distinguish them from such of the Modern Nobility, which they reckon'd already a Burthen to them.</P>
<P>Next, among the <HI>Whig</HI> Interest, and who were really Honest in their Designs for the General Good, were yet two Parties.</P>
<P>One Party, without Reflection on any, had taken a just Umbrage at the Growing Power of a certain Great Man; and as they had Reason to Ward off Personal Resentments, in case their Figure was diminished; and having their true Interest in View, together with the Publick Good, esteem'd it their Good Fortune, to have them both stand upon one Bottom;—And these Gentlemen came hear∣tily and honestly into the Measures of the Union.</P>
<P>Another Party were for the Succession <HI>Limited, &amp;c.</HI> but not for the Union; These brought the former first to them, thinking they would rather be for the Succession, and lay by the Thoughts of the Union; but finding them intirely for the Union, they fell in together.</P>
<P>The View of the Court in <HI>England</HI> was plain, <HI>viz. For the Suc∣cession at any Rate;</HI> and therefore, till this Juncture, they had Espoused that Party in <HI>Scotland,</HI> who were for the Succession, tho' with Limitations; and this the more easily brought those Gentle∣men into the Union, since there they secured the Succession, and had the <HI>English</HI> Limitations Confirm'd, which they knew and ac∣knowledg'd were better than their own.</P>
<P>Thus the two <HI>Whig</HI> Parties joyn'd, and the Duke of <HI>Queensberry,</HI> who had, in Concert with Her Majesty and the <HI>English</HI> Court, re∣moved all the seeming Difficulties on the part of <HI>Scotland,</HI> appearing publickly for it, the Union, as I have already noted, grew very Popular, the Court and the <HI>Whig</HI> Lords concurr'd in the General Good, the <HI>Jacobite</HI> Interest were abandon'd, and the Union grew up between all the Extremes as a Consequence; and it was meer∣ly Formed by the Nature of Things, rather than by the Designs of the Parties.</P>
<P>Things being brought to this Pass, the Acts of Parliament passed, and the Queen Impowered to Name Commissioners; I shall pur∣sue the Proceedings in Order as they ly before me, and make the needful Observations as I go.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="101"/>
The respective Acts of Parliament for this Nomination, as abso∣lutely necessary to the better understanding of the Case, and laying a Regular Scheme of the whole Matter before the Eye of the Read∣er, I have annexed in the Collection herewith marked.</P>
<P>They that had so wisely contrived the Beginning of this Work, could not be at a Loss to find out proper Persons for the Managing the Treaty in both Kingdoms; And therefore it was not long be∣fore Her Majesty Named the Commissioners for both Kingdoms, whose Names we shall presently come to.</P>
<P>I shall not descend to Encomiums on the Persons of the Treaters; For I am not about to write Panegyricks here, but an Impartial and Unbyast History of Fact. But since the Gentlemen have been ill treated, especially in <HI>Scotland,</HI> upon this very Head, Charg'd with strange Things, and Exposed in Print by some, who had no∣thing but their Aversion to the Treaty to move them to Maletreat them: I must be allowed, on all Occasions, to do them Justice in the Process of this Story.—And as I must owne, That, generally speaking, they were Persons of the greatest Probity, the best Cha∣racters, and the steadiest Adherence to the true Interest of their Countrey; so, their Abilities will appear in every Step taken in so great a Work, the bringing it to so short a Con∣clusion, and that, in so little Time, the Reducing it to so Concise a Form, and so Fixing it, That, when all the Obstruction imagi∣nable was made to it afterward in the Parliament of <HI>Scotland,</HI> the Mountains of Objection, which at first Amused the World proved such Mole-hills, were so easily Removed, Raised so much Noise, and Amounted to so little in Substance, That, after all was granted, that in Reason could be Demanded, the Amendments were so few, and of so little Weight, that there was not one Thing Material e∣nough, to obtain a Negative in the <HI>English</HI> Parliament.</P>
<P>I cannot but note here, That even those Amendments were not made, by Reason of any Omission in the Treaters; But the Parliament found the Opposing Party to the Succession had two Handles to lay hold on in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and therefore in Prudence gave way to such Amendments, as they had the least Reason to Justify; These two Heads, which I call Handles against the Succession, were,<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Strength of Party, by which they hop'd to Carry it at once, and Throw out the Treaty <HI>Brevi Manu;</HI> and this they endeavour'd to Form upon a General Dislike, they having Blacken'd it with the Mark of a Thing Dishonourable to the Sovereignty and the Inde∣pendence of the Nation.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. If they found that would not do, then to load it with such Ridiculous Amendments, as they knew would cause it to miscarry in the <HI>English</HI> Parliament; which they also thought would give <HI>Scotland</HI> great Advantage, and Encrease the Animosities in <HI>Scotland</HI> against the <HI>English,</HI> when the Rupture should appear to be from <HI>England,</HI> and the most Reasonable Concessions of <HI>Scotland</HI> be Re∣jected by them.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="102"/>
But both these Projects failed them; The first was effectually Answer'd by the Nature of the Thing; and their Strength fail∣ing them, they found they had cast up their Account false, their Motion being thrown out by a great Majority in Voting the first Article, as will appear presently.</P>
<P>The second, when they came to Examine Particulars, had not sufficient Strength of Reason to support it; all the Amend∣ments they could pretend to, were so small, That, <HI>as above,</HI> the Parliament of <HI>England</HI> never thought it worth their while to Dis∣pute them; and the Treaters themselves, for the most part, went into those Amendments, as they were offered.</P>
<P>Indeed this was a Disappointment to some People, who made no Question, at least, to puzzle the Cause, and raise such Difficul∣ties, as should Require a Remitting the Treaty back to <HI>Scotland;</HI> and so spin it out in Length, that the Nations might have Leisure to Form the separate Parties into some Order; and raising their Friends on both Sides, if possible, bring it to a Breach—; And that I do not pass an unjust Censure, I refer the Reader, among Infinite Pamphlets publish'd against this Affair, to one very plain and bare-fac'd Author mentioned before, Entituled, <HI>The Necessity of a War with</HI> England, <HI>in Order to Cure the present Distempers of the Times.</HI></P>
<P>I should do the Fomenters of the Nations Divisions too much Credit, to Trouble the Reader of this with any of their Print∣ed Oratory against this Union, much less enter into any Disquisiti∣ons upon the Subject of their Clamours;—But I may, perhaps, touch upon the principal Heads of their Objections, and let the World know also, who were some of the Objectors.</P>
<P>When the Acts were thus pass'd, and Her Majesty had Nam'd Commissioners on both Sides, and the Work seemed to be going about in Earnest; The Learned Scriblers of the Age began to Harrass the World with their Schemes, and all the Mountebank Statesmen of the Times set to Work, to propose their Wondrous Methods for Curing this Antient Distemper of the Nations, and striving to have it said of themselves, who was Forwardest in the Great Work.</P>
<P>The Industry they discover'd had, in nothing, a greater Concur∣rence, than in this, That the whole Croud of Writers, with an Universal Agreement, had the Honour to be intirely mistaken; and not one of them had Eyes to see to the true Interest of the Nations; every Man, as, in such Cases is usual, Eyed the respective Interests or Advantages, as he thought, of the Nation to which he belong'd, and set himself to Work to Answer the Objections of the other, Defending, Arguing, and Fatiguing their own Heads, and their Readers, with the Confused Labyrinths of their own Projects; but not once touching the true String, which, with a National Unison, would have immediately Sounded out the Harmony of General Peace.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="103"/>
Nor am I at all Arrogant, in saying, they were all so generally mistaken in their Notions of what this Union should be; Since, as I have said, every one fell to Arguing the single and separate Ad∣vantages of the Nation they belong'd to; Insisting on their Politick Notions, and Wise Schemes for their respective Advantages: But, not one, that I met with, ever Entered into the True and Only Notion Essential to the Union; I mean the Principle of Self-Denial, how far either Nation was to Condescend and Advance to one ano∣ther, How the present Union Consisted not, in Gaining Advantages on either Hand of one and other; but in Abatements, in giving each other Advantages, in yielding up Privileges, opening the Treasures and Strength of either Nation, to the Good and Benefit of the whole.</P>
<P>They never dream'd, That, to Unite, was, in it self, a full and a general Retribution for every Step taken from one Side to the other; That a New National Interest was to be Erected; and that giving or Conceding Rights, Advantages and Interests, whe∣ther in Commerce or in Privileges, was losing nothing at all; but was like a Man giving Presents to a Lady, whom he designs to make his Wife; which is but taking his Money out of one Pocket, and putting it into another; or like a Man settling his Estate in Joynture on his Wife, which is still his own, and is effectually se∣cured for his Posterity.</P>
<P>The Gentlemen must pardon me, if I tell them, That, for want of this True and Original Notion of Union, they took but too much Pains to Inform us all, they had neither the Spirit of Union in their Minds, nor the Knowledge of it in their Heads—; And this run them upon Wild <HI>Dilemmas</HI> and Dark Schemes of Federati∣ons and Confederations; This sent them to <HI>Belgia, Helvetia, Po∣lonia,</HI> and I know not whither, for Examples for Schemes, Prece∣dents, and I know not what strange Systems of National Unions; all which, I must take the Liberty to say, were as Wide from the only Step, that could make these Nations happy, as the East is from the West, tended to nothing, but Confusion of Interests, National Jealousies, and in the end War and Destruction.</P>
<P>These Gentlemen were for making Bargains between the Nations, not for bringing two Great and Mighty Kingdoms into one Vast United Body, the same in Interest, the same in Prospect, the same in every Substantial Constituting Part; The Advocates of either People talk'd like Counsellors Pleading for their Clients, not like two Friends, that were Striving, who should part with most, for the Interest and Engagement of the Love of each other.</P>
<P>In short, the Union has been brought to pass, not by gaining from, but by yielding to one another; Not by making Conditions and Advantages of one another, but by Conceding to one another; One part opens the Treasures of their Trade, the other struggles to bear their Share of the Weight and Burden of Expensive and Bloody Wars; This part yields up one thing, that abates another, and Mutual Condescensions, not Mutual Encroachments, have brought this Work to pass.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="104"/>
And here lyes the great Mystery of the Union; They that think strange of the Circumlocutions the Wisest Heads have taken, may find them here; They that Enquire into the Reasons of former Miscarriages, may find them all here; If there was any want of Temper, any mutual Distrusts, any secret Murmurs of Parties, any Jealousies of Consequences, it was all to be found here; That the People, who Debated these Points, never Look'd beyond the pre∣sent State, never Considered the Conjunct Capacity of the Nations, never drew the Ballance of Interests, or stated the Affairs of both Nations into one Account Current.</P>
<P>Had they ever done this, they would have seen that Monster, as they call'd the Union, a most Beautiful Creature, Admirable in its Contexture, Agreeable in its Figure, Squar'd like a most Exquisite Piece of Architect, both for Ornament, Strength, and Usefulness; They would have seen it a Compleat Circle, all the Lines of which were drawn from, and depended upon one General Centre, the Pub∣lick Good, a Mighty Arch, every Stone of which mutually contribut∣ed, not to its Private Support only, but to the Strength of the whole: Here is the True Original of the Union, and the Wisdom of the Treaters on both sides, was in nothing more Conspicuous, than that they came to this Treaty furnished with the true Notions of what they were to do, and consequently the properest and only Method for the doing it could not be Concealed from them; and we cannot but observe, That, thro' all the Course of the Treaty, the Gentlemen kept themselves closs to this Principle, to yield to one another in every thing, which the Nature of the Union they aim'd at requir'd, and the Nature of the Thing before them would possibly permit.</P>
<P>I must confess, to me, all the Notions of Federal Unions, Gua∣rantees, and Everlasting Peace, which our several Writers fill'd our Heads with, while the Treaty was appointed, but not yet begun; appear'd to me as imperfect <HI>Embrios,</HI> false Conceptions, and Births that must end in Abortions and Disappointments; I will not say, I had Foresight of Events enough to prescribe what Methods should be taken, or what Issue would be produced from the Treaty then in View; but this I took the Freedom always to tell the World, That it must be a general, compleat, intire and indissolvable Union of In∣terests and Parties, depending upon Equalities of Privileges, and Equalities of Burdens, Equalities of Prospects, and Equalities, if possible, in Desires, or that it would be Imperfect in its Parts, and Confused in its Whole.</P>
<P>I know one Reason why this sort of Union was less thought on, than perhaps it would have been, was, because the Gentlemen, when they come to Examine what had ever been Attempted this way, found nothing of a full and intire Union, but that under the Conquest of the Parliament Times—; And, <HI>Alas! SAYS ONE,</HI> This must be rendered so Odious, because 'twas the Work of a Tyrant, an Usurper, and what not, that no Body could bear to Recommend it; and if at any time a Man was driven by the Necessity of his
<PB N="10" REF="105"/>
Judgment, the Convictions of his Reason, and the Consequences of Argument, to come to the Borders of that Scheme, he would Start at the Hint, as if he had seen a <HI>Spectrum,</HI> and fly even from his own Reason, because it concurr'd with what was hit upon by the Man and the People he did not Approve.</P>
<P>And why will you go by <HI>Whitehall</HI> Gentlemen, where so many wicked Rebels Triumph'd over their Monarch? Why will you use the Navy, nay some of the very Ships, with which the same <HI>Oliver Cromwel</HI> Beat your Neighbours?</P>
<P>If <HI>Oliver</HI> had not been a Master of Politicks, he had never been <HI>Oliver Cromwel</HI> in the Terms we are now Talking of him; and because he hit upon the only Step that could be taken to Fix the Union of the two Nations, must we Reject it, and rather Destroy the Kingdoms, than close with his Unhallowed Method?</P>
<P>Reason and the Nature of Things guides all Men, whose Eyes are open, to the same Methods, when they are pursuing the same Designs, let <HI>Oliver Cromwel</HI> be what he will, and who he will, 'tis no part of my Business here, take him in all the Blackest Figures he can be Represented—; What was the End he pursued in his Uniting <HI>Scotland</HI> to <HI>England</HI>—? It was so to joyn them, that both Parties being made intirely easy, might, without Hesitation, sub∣mit themselves to his otherwise precarious Authority; and was he right in this, That, to give the two Nations a free and full Communication, both of Trade, Privileges and Advantages, was the true and only way to make all People easie—? So far his Project may be good for us, without so much as touching upon the Parallel.</P>
<P>The Business of the Union was, to make the Nations easie, to put them in a State of Mutual Advantage; If fourty Tyrants have pursued the Method for it, tho' with Wicked Designs, it was for us to take the Method, and mend the Design, as much as we could.</P>
<P><HI>Oliver Cromwel</HI> made a Conquest of <HI>Scotland</HI>—, well, and what then—? Let those People, who have Talk'd so much of an Union of Subjection, and Conquering <HI>Scotland,</HI> go back hither for a Precedent; <HI>Oliver Cromwel</HI> knew as well what belong'd to Conquest, as any Body in this Age will pretend to; Nor was he less Politick in Keeping, than Terrible in Obtaining; and what did he resolve all his Northern Conquest into—? Nothing but Union, the best Concerted, the best Executed, the best Approved, that ever this Island saw till now; Nor could all the Heads in Christendom have Formed the present Happy Union, but from the Schemes of those Times.</P>
<P>If ever Nation gain'd by being Conquer'd, it was here; They were Subdued first, and then made Happy; and <HI>Scotland</HI> Flourished, Justice had its Uninterrupted Course, Trade Increas'd, Money plentifully Flowed in, and all under what they call'd Tyranny and Usurpation, all under a Standing Army, Government, and with all the Disadvantages that can be imagined from such a Constitution, as tended to Subjection, not Liberty, Poverty and Misery, not Peace and Plenty.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="106"/>
And what was the Foundation of all this? Nothing but the Na∣tural Product of Common Reasoning, he found, that the only way to preserve the Conquest he had made on the Powers of the Nations, was to make a Conquest of their Affections; That the only way to do this, was to let them see their Interest and Happiness in his Government; and that this could only be brought to pass, by Uniting and intirely Incorporating the Nations into one; Commu∣nicating Peace, Privileges, and all possible Advantages to them—; And thereby letting them see the true way to their prosperity.</P>
<P>No Man will say, this was not the most Politick Step he could take; and must we Contemn the Method, because we cannot be Reconcil'd to the Man—? Certainly if Union and Incorporati∣on of Interests was able to make the Nation Happy under a stand∣ing Army, and an Absolute Government, as that was; Things in their Nature, Inconsistent with Liberty and National Prosperity; it must be much more Capable under a Just and Limited Government, where Law Governs the very Actions of the Sovereign, and all the Branches of Power are squar'd by, and sincerely Imploy'd for the Publick Good: And it can be no Lessening the Value of any True Scheme of National Management, that a Person Used or Contriv'd it, that we call a Tyrant or an Usurper; Let him be never so much a Tyrant, he show'd he had the True Spirit of Government in him by this, that he knew the only way to make his Government safe, was to make it easy; and to have the People quiet, was to make them Happy—; And this he did by <HI>Ʋnion,</HI> an intire In∣corporated Union—; And the Event proved, his Measures were rightly taken.</P>
<P>Our End is now the same, tho' our Views are differing, to make the People Happy is the End—; If <HI>Ʋnion</HI> be the way, why is it to be liked the worse, because <HI>Oliver Cromwel</HI> drew the Scheme?</P>
<P>I have made this Digression, not purely to show, how our Writ∣ers came to be mistaken in their Schemes, and why they never hit upon this Draught in all their Proposals, tho' that introduc'd it; but also to prove, that this Intire Incoporating Union has in it self the Seed of National Felicity, in that it wrought then that Wonder which the World can rarely produce, <HI>viz.</HI> Liberty in Tyranny, Prosperity in Conquest, and a Nation Saved even in being Sub∣dued.</P>
<P>Could it produce this Wonderful Effect, much more must it be supposed Capable now? And I am perswaded, no Man in his Senses will like the Effect of the present Union the worse, for its receiving any of its parts from the Politicks of these Times, if the Happiness of the present Time may be seen in it.</P>
<P>And here I must own, That the present Union has some Ad∣vantage, <HI>tho' the Nations have paid dear for the Experiment,</HI> in that it has been Formed upon the Foot of all the most Politick Schemes of former Times; and all the Miscarriages of former Treaties have been as Warnings to Furnish the Experience of these Times
<PB N="12" REF="107"/>
to make them wary, and instruct them how to avoid the Rocks that others Split on.</P>
<P>I have now brought the Treaters to <HI>London;</HI> Their Names, and the Commission for them respectively to Treat, I have Inserted in the Minutes of the Treaty, as it was laid before the Parliament of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and immediately following this Part.</P>
<P>When they first met, they hardly knew what Measures they should take; They knew what Business they came to do, but I dare say, the Gentlemen will bear with me, in saying, they could not fore∣see the Manner and Management that follow'd; and it was a pleas∣ing Surprize, to find all Sides and Parties to agree, in leaving all Politick Methods formerly studied, rather to Delay and Defeat the Design of an Union, than to Compleat it; and to fall in heartily to Consider, as the General <HI>Thesis,</HI> what could Conduce most to the Main Design of their Meeting, <HI>THE ƲNION;</HI> And in Or∣der to this, they Resolved not to Study Advantages against one another; nor to Demand on either Side any Thing, but what was agreeable to both Kingdoms, in their United Capacity; This was a Happy Indication, That both Sides came together with a True Spi∣rit of the Union among them; That they sincerely intended to apply themselves to it with the utmost Diligence, and to pursue it by all the most proper Methods to bring it to pass—; The very contrary Extreme of which, is what, as I have already noted, has been the principal Occasion of the Miscarriage of all the former Treaties, and which Good Men were very much afraid of now—.</P>
<P>Before they met in Publick, some of the Commissioners on both Sides had a Meeting among themselves, privately to Consider of the Method of Proceeding.</P>
<P>And here it was first Debated, in what Manner Proposals should be Delivered and Receiv'd; Some were for having Conferences of every Thing that should be proposed, for the Convenience of Free Reasoning; Others Objected against that as Tedious, and Offered as the most Expeditious Method, That every Thing should be De∣livered in Writing, and then the Commissioners respectively Meeting apart, might Reason among themselves, and give in their Resolutions the more perfect—; And this was agreed on by both parties.</P>
<P>This is the Cause, That, in the Minutes of this Treaty, we have little of their private Reasonings Recorded; since, their having been thus by themselves, they have not been noticed so, as to come to Light in any Regular Manner.</P>
<P>There was but one Publick Conference, which was Desir'd by the Commissioners for <HI>Scotland;</HI> and this was about the Number of the <HI>Scots</HI> Representatives in Parliament; and in this 'tis impos∣sible to get the particular Arguments used on both Sides. The par∣ticular Persons on either Side were as follows,</P>
<P><HI>First</HI> the Lord Treasurer of <HI>England,</HI> who Opened the Thing, and Desir'd the Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> to propose their Reasons, why the <HI>English</HI> should give a greater Number than was mentioned.</P>
<P>Lord Chancellor of <HI>Scotland</HI> spoke next, and gave Reasons why they Insisted upon a greater Number.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="108"/>
Mr. Secretary <HI>Harley</HI> Replyed to Lord Chancellor of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>The Lord Chancellor Spoke a Second Time, in Answer to Mr. Secretary <HI>Harley.</HI></P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>Pembroke</HI> Spoke after, to what the Lord Chancellor had offered.</P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>Stair</HI> Replyed to the Earl of <HI>Pembroke</HI>'s Speech.</P>
<P>The Lord Keeper spoke next.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>David Dalrymple</HI> Follow'd the Lord Keeper.</P>
<P>Duke of <HI>Devonshire</HI> to Sir <HI>David.</HI></P>
<P>And Mr. <HI>Seton</HI> of <HI>Pitmedden</HI> Concluded.</P>
<P>The great Design of the Arguments on the part of the <HI>Scots</HI> Com∣missioners, were summ'd up in this;</P>
<P>That they could have no Precedent, as to Number of Represen∣tatives, Argued from <HI>Oliver Cromwel</HI>'s Division; because he was Ar∣bitrary, and neither gave a just Representation to <HI>England,</HI> or to <HI>Ireland;</HI></P>
<P>That the present Scheme of Taxes could not be the Rule; but, if the Representative was to be Measur'd by the Proportion of Taxes, it was on their Side; since, immediately upon the Union, those Taxes would be greater;</P>
<P>That, if any Rule could be laid down, it ought to be an Arith∣metical Proportion, between the Number of People and the Taxes paid, Considered on both Sides respectively; In which Case, the <HI>Hollanders</HI> were brought as an Example, where, if you take the People, without their Circumstances of Wealth, they Bear no Pro∣portion, because their Riches are vastly greater than their Num∣bers; If their Riches are taken without their People, the Dispro∣portion would be as great the other way.</P>
<P>Upon the whole it was Concluded, there could be no certain Rule, to Direct their Lordships the Commissioners, but the present Circumstances of the Nations should be Judg'd of by both Sides, and such a Representative to be Allow'd, as should be Agree∣able to Justice in both.</P>
<P>Upon this Debate, their Lordships Retired on either Hand; and the next Day, the Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> brought in a Proposal for a Representative for <HI>Scotland,</HI> Augmented to Fourty Five Com∣moners, and Sixteen Lords, which the <HI>Scots</HI> Commissioners acqui∣esc'd in, as will more particularly appear by the Minutes of the Treaty, which are inserted at large, as they were Extracted out of the Books of the Commissioners, and beginning with the Com∣missions respectively given to the Persons Appointed to Treat, as follows.</P>

<P>After the Lords, Commissioners for both Kingdoms had taken their Places, The Commissions were open'd, and Read by the respective Secretaries.</P>
<P>The Lord Keeper of the Great Seal of <HI>England,</HI> Addressing himself to the Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland,</HI> spoke in these Words,<Q><P><HI>My Lords.</HI></P>
<P>WE the Commissioners appointed by Her Majesty, and Autho∣riz'd by the Parliament of <HI>England,</HI> To Consult and Treat with your Lordships, as Impowred in like manner, by Her Majesty and the Parliament of <HI>Scotland,</HI> concerning an Union of the two Kingdoms, and such other things as We the Commissio∣ners on both Parts shall think convenient and necessary for the Ho∣nour of Her Majesty, and the common Good of both Kingdoms, do apprehend there never was (in any Assembly of this nature) so little occasion as at present, for the Commissioners of <HI>England,</HI> to give any verbal Assurances of their Zeal to Promote and compleat (so far as in their Power) the great and good Design we are met about, since it cannot be doubted, but that we bring along with
<PB N="22" REF="117"/>
us the same Sentiments, which so lately appeared in the Parliament of <HI>England,</HI> when they took care to manifest by a solemn Act, that they did postpone all other Considerations to their evidencing a good and Friendly Disposition towards the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>The Parliament of <HI>England,</HI> in making that unexpected Advance, seem'd Resolved, if possible, to attain that Union, which hath been so long thought necessary, by all that wish well to the Prosperity of both Nations.</P>
<P>And We most sincerely assure your Lordships, That we accord∣ingly meet your Lordships, with Hearts fully Resolv'd to use our outmost Endeavours to remove all Difficulties in this Treaty, to prevent all Misunderstandings, to cherish and Improve the Good Dispositions to one another we meet with, to have the General and Joynt Good of both Kingdoms, solely in our View, and not the separate of either; but to Act, as if we were already United in In∣terest, and had nothing left to Consider, but what Settlements and Provisions are most likely to conduce to the common Safety and Happiness of this whole Island of <HI>Great-Britain.</HI></P>
<P>Which Measures, if pursued on both Parts, we hope may enable us to prepare such Terms of Union, as may prove satisfactory to Her Majesty, and the Parliaments of both Kingdoms.</P></Q></P>
<P>And the Earl of <HI>Seafield,</HI> Lord High Chancellor of <HI>Scotland,</HI> on the part of the Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland,</HI> spoke as followeth,<Q><P><HI>My Lords,</HI></P>
<P>THe Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland,</HI> have desired me to As∣sure your Lordships, that they meet you on this Occasion, with great Willingness and Satisfaction, to Treat of an Union between the two Kingdoms, and of such other Matters and Concerns, as may be for Her Majesties Honour, and the maintain∣ing a Good Understanding between the two Nations.</P>
<P>We are convinced that an Union will be of a great Advantage to both; the Protestant Religion will be thereby the more Firmly Se∣cured; the Designs of our Enemies effectually Disappointed; and the Riches and Trade of the whole Island Advanced.</P>
<P>This Union has been often Endeavour'd, both before, and since the Kingdoms were United in Allegiance under one Sovereign; and several Treaties have been set on foot for that End, tho without the desired Success; But now we are hopeful that this shall be the Happy Opportunity of Accomplishing it; Her Majesty hath fre∣quently signify'd Her Good Inclinations towards it; And we are the more Encouraged to expect Success in this Treaty, by the Good Disposition appeared in the Parliament of <HI>Scotland</HI> for it, and by the Friendly proceedings in the last Session of the Parliament of <HI>England,</HI> which gave general satisfaction.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="118"/>
We have great Confidence in your Lordships Good Intentions, and we shall be ready on our parts, to enter into such Measures with you, as may bring the Treaty to such a Conclusion, as may be ac∣ceptable to Her Majesty, and to the Parliaments of both Kingdoms.</P></Q></P>

<P>THE Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> are so fully convinced, that nothing but an Entire Union of the two Kingdoms, will settle perfect and lasting Friendship between them; That they therefore think fit to decline entring into any further Consideration of the Proposal now made by the Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland,</HI> as not tending to that End and Desire; That the Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> would be pleased to give in their Answer, to the Pro∣posal delivered on <HI>Munday</HI> the 22<HI>d</HI> instant by the Lords Commis∣sioners for <HI>England,</HI> in order to an entire Union of both Kingdoms.</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="observations">
<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS on the <HI>MINUTS</HI> of the three first Days.</HEAD>
<P>The Ceremonies on either Hand being over, <HI>Wednesday</HI> was the first Day in which it may be said, any thing of Business was entred upon.</P>
<P>The Commissioners on the <HI>English</HI> side presented a Summary, as it may be call'd, of an Union in General, by which it is plain, a compleat Incorporation of the two Kingdoms was proposed.</P>
<P>The <HI>Scots</HI> Proposal was less General, and yet readily agreeing to the Succession, to a Communication of Privileges, and an Inter∣course of Trade.</P>
<P>I mention this here, because it was afterwards objected to the Treaters on the <HI>Scots</HI> side in the following Parliament, That
<PB N="25" REF="120"/>
they had given up their Countrey to the <HI>English,</HI> in coming into an Incorporating Union immediately, without proposing any Terms which might have been more Advantageous to <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>It is manifest the <HI>Scots</HI> Commissioners did make Proposals of Uniting, which were not Incorporating; or at least, which being restricted to their own Countrey only, were significant of a Concern for <HI>Scotland,</HI> leaving the Proposal on the behalf of <HI>England,</HI> to the <HI>English</HI> Commissioners.</P>
<P>But, as will appear in the subsequent Minuts, the <HI>English</HI> Commssioners were come to a Resolution previous to this Treaty, <HI>viz.</HI> That nothing could compleat the Felicity of either King∣dom, and for ever remove all possible Difficulties, Breaches, and Separation of Interests from among them for the future, but an entire and Incorporating Union, by which the two Nations should be formed into one Government, be under one Sove∣reign Head, in one Represented Body, standing upon one Foun∣dation, enjoying equal Privileges, and in common bearing one ge∣neral proportion of Burdens, the same in End and Mean, having but one Common Interest, one Name, and being for ever here∣after but one People.</P>
<P>This therefore they laid down as the <HI>Thesis</HI> of their future Conferences, and pursuant to this, the first General they delive∣red in, contain'd the Three and most Essential Articles of the following Treaty, <HI>viz.</HI> The Uniting the Two Kingdoms into One, the settling the Representation in one Assembly of Par∣liament, and the settling the Succession in the same Line.</P>
<P>And the <HI>Scots</HI> Proposals being short in the General Incorpo∣rating Part, the <HI>English</HI> Commissioners insisted upon it, as above, de∣clining to Treat upon Particulars till that was first Determin'd, all Debate of Particulars being not so directly tending to a Con∣clusion, till the great and main Question was Agreed to, Whe∣ther the Union should be Entire or no, in the sense as above.</P>
<P>The prosecuting this Question will effectually Defend the <HI>Scots</HI> Commissioners, who tho they were afterward convinc'd of the main Point in Debate, <HI>viz.</HI> That nothing but an Entire Union would be effectual to settle a lasting Friendship between the two Nations, yet did not so easily give up their other Pro∣posals, as was suggested; nor did they give them up at all meerly upon the <HI>English</HI> Commissioners refusing to Treat on any other Foot—. For the directest Answer to a Resolution so posi∣tive as that might have been thought to have been an equal Stiffness, and refusing to resolve upon so general a Clause, till other Heads had been Adjusted.</P>
<P>But the Commissioners on the <HI>Scots</HI> side found themselves convinc'd, <HI>First,</HI> Of the Sincerity and candid Intentions of the Commissioners on the <HI>English</HI> Part, to pursue such a Treaty, and in such a manner, as might most conduce to the mutual Hap∣piness
<PB N="26" REF="121"/>
of both Kingdoms, and to make the Union both Lasting and Effectual.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> They found themselves convinc'd upon serious De∣bate and further Enquiry into Particulars, that nothing but this Incorporation of Interests, Privileges, and Circumstances, could make an Effectual, Lasting, Indissolvable Union, and so they came unto it with the same Sincerity, and from the same candid Design of settling the whole, and of Acting to the advantage of Either Party—. Not being at all Over-ruled, Awed, or Drawn in, as was objected afterwards against them—. And this would appear at large, if the long Debates, Speeches, and Arguments on both Sides could have been recover'd.</P>

<P>THE Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland,</HI> have considered the Proposal given in to them by the Lords Commissioners for <HI>England,</HI> on <HI>Monday</HI> the 22d instant, and do agree, that the two Kingdoms of <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>England,</HI> be for ever United into one Kingdom, by the Name of <HI>Great-Britain;</HI> That the United Kingdom of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> be Represented by one and the same Parliament, and that the Succession to the Monarchy of the Kingdom of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> (in case of Failure of Heirs of Her Majesties Body) shall Descend upon the most excellent Princess <HI>Sophia</HI> Electoress and Dutchess Dowager of <HI>Hannover,</HI> and remain to her and the Heirs of her Body, being Protestants, to whom the Succession to the Crown of <HI>England</HI> is pro∣vided, by an Act made in the 12th and 13th year of the Reign of the late King <HI>William,</HI> Intituled, <HI>An Act for the further Limitation of the Crown, and better securing the Rights and Liberties of the Subjects, and excluding all Papists, and who shall Marry Papists, in the Terms of the said Act;</HI> With this provision, That all the Subjects of the Uni∣ted Kingdom of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> shall have full Freedom and Inter∣course of Trade and Navigation, to, and from any Part or Place within the said United Kingdom, and Plantations thereunto be∣longing; and there be a Communication of all other Privileges and Advantages, which do, or may belong to the Subjects of either Kingdom.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATION III.</HEAD>
<P>The main Points of Union being thus settled, as above, and all the Federal Provincial and Confederating Schemes, which the World without Doors had filled their Heads with, being va∣nish'd, the Commissioners fell closs to their Work; and the first Article proposed by the <HI>English</HI> Commissioners laid the Scheme of the whole Affair, <HI>viz.</HI> Customs, Excises, and Temporary Taxes, Prohibitions, Restrictions, and Regulations of Trade.</P>
<P>The great Question now before them was, how to fix a Center in all these, or a great Standart of Equalities, so as every part might bear its equal Share of the Burdens of the War, in Proportion to its Capacity, and every part enjoy its equal Share of the Advan∣tages of Commerce, each bear an equal part of the Weight of the Government, and reap an equal part of its Protection. This Scale of Equalities had a great Variety of Discording Parts in it; To bring together the Difficulties of which was the Business now before them, and the Method of Reconciling them, will appear in the further Observations on these Proceedings.</P>
<P>The first thing requisit to bring this Matter into a way of De∣bate, was for either side to give in a True State of the ordinary Revenue, the Debts and the Extraordinary Taxes of either King∣dom, that a Scale of Proportions might be formed.</P>
<P>I mention it here, to note how naturally every thing occurr'd, in order to the main End; and how, after the first Concession of an entire Incorporation, every thing, that might tend to Compleating that Design, came in of Course; For, without doubt, Equalities and Proportion of Taxes, Privileges and Ad∣vantages, was, and must be the only Method, to bring about a compleat entire Union of Interests, and it was impossible to be done without it.</P>
<P>The Undertaking indeed Amazed the World, and when People began to look into it with but a Transient View, it appeared a
<PB N="30" REF="125"/>
perfect <HI>Chaos,</HI> a Mass of Absurdities, which it would be impos∣sible to Reconcile; The People, who had proposed their Fede∣ral Schemes, laugh'd at this Project, and talk'd of it as impracti∣cable, called it a <HI>Chimera</HI> of the <HI>English</HI> Ministery, and pretended to Prophesy its Dwindling into Nothing, and bringing the Treaty to the same Issue, as was done in the last Commission.</P>
<P>But, when Abler Heads began to look into it, and take it to Pieces, the Parts all appear'd capable of Reduction into Form, and the Presages of the Gentlemen who had so Banter'd it, ap∣pear'd groundless, the Mass began to move, and every thing re∣tiring to its proper place, guided by the Temper, Moderation, and Application of the Commissioners, the Beautiful Thing, cal∣led Union, began to shew it self, and the Nation began to con∣ceive Hopes of its being perfected, in spight of all the seeming Difficulties, with which the Enemies to the Design had clog'd Mens Expectation—, as will appear hereafter.</P>
<P>To bring the Ballance of Circumstances upon the Stage, it was absolutely necessary to enter into the several Inequalities, in which the two Kingdoms then stood; These Inequalities, as they lay particularly before the Treaters, consisted in Matters of Taxes, Customs, Excises and Commerce.</P>
<P>In order to state these, the several Debts and Revenue of the respective Nations were stated; Abstracts of which are annexed to these Observations, as they were given in to the Commissio∣ners of both Kingdoms.</P>

<P>It was in the Debates of this Day, that the great Difficulties lay; and indeed those that seemed most concerned for the Suc∣cess, apprehended something here too difficult to be Mastered, and that would render all the rest Abortive.</P>
<P>The State of the Affairs of either Nation was in short thus,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. <HI>England</HI> had very large Incomes or Revenues, and their Customs and Excise brought in vast Sums, <HI>viz.</HI>
<LIST>
<ITEM>Customs, 1341559 <HI>l. per Annum.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>Excises, 947602 <HI>l. per Annum.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>But, on the other Hand, <HI>England</HI> had vast Debts lay upon them to discharge; and for the Discharge of which, these Re∣venues, and almost all their other Taxes, the Land Tax and Malt Tax excepted, were Appropriated.
<LIST>
<ITEM>2. <HI>Scotland</HI> had but small Revenues, her Customs and Excise producing but the following Sums, <HI>viz.</HI>
<LIST>
<ITEM>The Customs let out in Tack or Farm from Year to Year only at 30000 <HI>l. per Annum.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>The Excise, Farmed also, at 35000 <HI>l. per Annum.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>But then the Revenue of <HI>Scotland</HI> was entirely free from Anti∣cipations, or Appropriations on any Account of Debt; Not, but that there were Publick Debts too, but the Revenue was not Charged with them.</P>
<P>Now, upon the Uniting the Revenues of both Kingdoms, under these differing Circumstances, there were but two possible Me∣thods that could be proposed;
<LIST>

<ITEM>Either, 1. That each Kingdom coming to a full Point in Matters of Revenue, should, like two Tradesmen coming into Partnership, pay off their own respective Debts, and bring in their several Proportions of Stock clear of all In∣cumberances.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Or, 2. That, putting the General Accounts of Debts and Stock together, the <HI>English</HI> should make good the Inequa∣lities to the <HI>Scots</HI> some other way.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The <HI>Scots</HI> Commissioners wisely proposed, for the Ease of their own Country, That the Revenues of <HI>Scotland</HI> should not be at all Chargeable with the <HI>English</HI> Debts—; And this was thought to be a very good Argument, to Excuse <HI>Scotland</HI> from some Duties, which, notwithstanding the General Article of pay∣ing Equal Taxes, <HI>Scotland</HI> could by no means bear; Of these, as they respect Customs or Excises, Foreign or Home Trade, I shall speak as they come in Order.</P>
<P>But the <HI>English</HI> Commissioners adhering to the first Principle of the Treaty, <HI>viz.</HI> Of its being an intire Incorporating Union, were on that Account obliged to insist upon this also, which formed afterward, the Sixth Article, <HI>viz.</HI> That there be an E∣quality of <HI>Customs, Excises,</HI> and all other Taxes thro'out the United Kingdom, as that without which the Union could not be entire.</P>
<P>This being laid down as a general <HI>Thesis</HI> in the whole Debate, two things came in Course to be Examined as <HI>Mediums.</HI><LIST>
<ITEM>1. A Scale of Proportions to form the Equalities.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. An Equivalent to be given for supplying unavoidable In∣equalities.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>And this will be found to run thro' the whole Series of the Trea∣ty, as the Foundation of the whole; and however after Ridi∣cul'd and Reflected on by the Opposers of the Treaty, it ap∣pears to be the only Foundation they could have gone upon, and which was the only <HI>Medium</HI> to bring the Treaty into a possibi∣lity of coming to a happy Conclusion.</P>
<P>No Man could deny but all Equalities consisted in Proporti∣ons, and to have extended the thing called Equality of Taxes, to a Numerical Equality, as some pretend in <HI>England,</HI> was saying nothing, the Customs, manner of Valuation of Land, and innu∣merable Circumstances of <HI>Scotland,</HI> rendering it Impracticable.</P>
<P>The <HI>English</HI> Commissioners therefore when they insisted upon an Equality of Taxes, readily agreed to the giving <HI>Scotland</HI> an Equivalent for the payment of their own Debts, so far as their Customs and Excises should come into the Appropriations of the <HI>English</HI> Revenue.</P>
<P>What Alterations, Exceptions, and Abatements were made as to Equalities of Taxes, will be spoken to in the Minutes of the <HI>Scots</HI> Parliament, where the Exceptions were made, and those Calculations Adjusted.</P>

<P>THE Lord Chancellor in the Name of the Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland,</HI> deliver'd to the Board a further Answer to the Propo∣sal made by the Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> on the 29<HI>th April</HI> last, which was Read.</P>
<P>THE Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> did take into their Con∣sideration the Proposal offered by the Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> the 29<HI>th April,</HI> &amp; found it comprehended so many Particulars, That they judg'd it most proper to answer it Point by Point; Accordingly on the 9<HI>th</HI> Instant, they gave an Answer as to the Customs &amp; Land-tax, and did not mention any thing therein of the Excises, be∣cause the Consideration of these was depending before the Com∣mittee of the Commissioners of both sides; but to satisfie the Lords Commissioners for <HI>England,</HI> That nothing shall be wanting on the part of the Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland,</HI> that is necessary for the attaining an entire Union, they do agree to the Equality of Excises on Ale, Beer, Mum, Cyder, Sweets, Perry, Low-Wines, Aquavitae and Spirits; But they do propose an Ex∣emption from all other Burthens and Excises within <HI>Scotland</HI> for a competent Time, to be adjusted in the course of this Treaty, That the Subjects of <HI>Scotland</HI> may (by the benefit arising from the Com∣munication of Trade) be put in a Capacity to bear a Proportion of other Burthens and Excises, being willing at the Commencement of the Union, to bear equal Excises on all that is Exported from <HI>Scot∣land</HI> to <HI>England</HI> or the Plantations; And the Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> do hope, that the Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> will be convinced that the Immunitie from these other Burthens and Ex∣cises for a term of Years, is consistent with an entire Union, and
<PB N="34" REF="129"/>
will not put the Trade on an unequal Foot, when the present Cir∣cumstances of both Kingdoms are duly considered.</P>
<P>And whereas the Lords Commissioners for <HI>England,</HI> did, by their Proposal, declare they were ready to agree to an Equivalent for what <HI>Scotland</HI> shall be Taxed in towards the payment of the Debts of <HI>England</HI> in all particulars whatsoever, the Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> are ready to enter with their Lordships into the consi∣deration of this Equivalent, and how to make it effectual.</P>
<P>THE Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> withdrew, and being re∣turn'd, The Lord Keeper, in their Lordships Names, deliver'd to the Board, their Reply to the foresaid Answer, which was Read.</P>
<P>THE Lords Commissioners for <HI>England,</HI> taking into their Con∣sideration, the Paper delivered to them this Meeting, by the Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland,</HI> are so sensible of the Lords Commissio∣ners for <HI>Scotlands</HI> having Agreed to an Equality of Excises, as to all Excysable Liquors (as the Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> under∣stand the same) and to an Equality of Excyses and Burthens on all Goods Exported to <HI>England,</HI> and the Plantations, which the Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> do not doubt, will be Agreed to by the Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland,</HI> as to all Goods Exported to all places whatsoever, that to shew their Readiness to comply with every thing Reasonable, to the bringing this Treaty to a Good Effect; They are willing to enter into the consideration of the par∣ticular Excyses and Burthens Point by Point, which being of several Natures, so that they will require to be distinctly considered, The Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> find it necessary to desire a little time, for giving their Opinion on each particular Head: But in General are enclin'd to consent to an Exemption of Excyses and Burthens, as propos'd in such cases, where it may be done without prejudice to the Trade, or Manufactures of <HI>England:</HI> As to the Ex∣cyses, where an Exemption cannot be consented to without such Inconveniency, The Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> will consider of a proper Equivalent, or some other expedient to promote the desired Union of the two Nations.</P>
<P>AND as to those Customs and Excyses, to which their Lordships have already Agreed, and for which an Equivalent is to be allowed to the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland;</HI> The Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> do think it would tend to the Dispatch of this Treaty, that the Committee already appointed should continue to sit, in order to the Adjusting that Matter.</P>

<P>The Lord Chancellor, in the Name of the Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland,</HI> deliver'd to the Board the following Paper, in Relati∣on to the several Taxes and Excises, to which their Lordships had agreed, and renewing their Proposal of the 13<HI>th</HI> Instant, for a Ge∣neral Exemption for some competent time, from all other Excises and Burthens, than those already agreed to, which was Read.</P>
<P>The Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland,</HI> since the last General Meeting, have again considered the Proposition made by the Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> the 29<HI>th April</HI> last, <HI>viz.</HI> That there be the same Customs, Excises and all other Taxes; and the same Prohibitions, Restrictions and Regulations of Trade thro'-out the United Kingdom of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> with the Papers which have been since delivered by the Commissioners of both Kingdoms upon that Subject, and do with great Satisfaction Observe, that the diffe∣rence, as to that Important Proposal, is brought to a very narrow Compass. And the Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> take this Oc∣casion to Acknowledge the Sense they have of the Regard shown by the Lords Commissioners for <HI>England,</HI> for the Subjects of <HI>Scotland</HI> after the desir'd Union; And the Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> having, by their several Proposals and Answers, agreed to the same Regulations of Trade, and to an Equality of Customs and Excises upon all Exciseable Liquors, and a <HI>Quota</HI> of Land Tax, all to com∣mence from the Union; As also to an Equality of all other Taxes after some Years, They do conceive, that they have fully comply∣ed with the said Proposal of the 29<HI>th April,</HI> excepting only, that they have propos'd an Exemption for sometime from all further Burthens, than those expresly consented to. And as to the Exemp∣tion desired, The Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> are very sen∣sible, That the Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> have not only, by their Paper of the 13<HI>th</HI> Instant, declared, That they were en∣clin'd to consent in General, to an Exemption of Excises and Bur∣thens, as proposed in such Cases, where it might be done, with∣out prejudice to the Trade and Manufactures of <HI>England;</HI> But that, in pursuance of that Good Disposition, Their Lordships, by their Paper the 15<HI>th</HI> Instant, have consented to an Exemption

<DIV3 N="5" TYPE="observation">
<HEAD>OBSERVATION V.</HEAD>
<P>The Commissioners were now entered upon the great Enqui∣ry about Equalities, and the first Matter relating to Taxes was that of the Land Tax; The Land Tax in <HI>England</HI> was a For∣midable Thing, being called a Tax of Four Shillings in the Pound of the Rent of Lands, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And the People who were Fond of Throwing a Tangled Skein in the Hands of the Treat∣ers, that might Shock them at the beginning, would have gone upon that Foot, alledging, That tho' the Rents in <HI>Scotland</HI> were differing from those in <HI>England;</HI> yet that 20 <HI>sh. sterl.</HI> Re∣venue being the same thing any where, it could as well afford to pay 4 <HI>sh.</HI> out of it in <HI>Scotland</HI> as any where else; and upon this Foot, it seems, were for bringing the Rents of Land in <HI>Scot∣land</HI> to a true Estimate, and so they would call this way of Taxing an Equality.</P>
<P>But to this it was Answer'd, <HI>First,</HI> That the <HI>Scots</HI> way of Collecting their Taxes, being rigorous and exact, if 4 <HI>s. per l.</HI> were laid by Parliament upon the whole Island, their Assess∣ments would <HI>bona fide</HI> be 4 <HI>s. per l.</HI> upon the Rack Rent of all their Lands.</P>
<P>Whereas 4 <HI>s. per l.</HI> in <HI>England</HI> never puts the Assessors out of their old Road, but every County being Rated in the very Bo∣dy of the Act, the Title is <HI>Ipso Facto</HI> Repeal'd, since if the Lands, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of that Country will raise the Money by an Assess∣ment of 1 <HI>s.</HI> 6 <HI>d. per</HI> Pound, <HI>and 'tis known some do for less,</HI> the Law is satisfied, and the End answered.</P>
<P>Now to Tax <HI>Scotland</HI> at 4 <HI>s. per l.</HI> upon her Nett Rent, and Tax the Northern and Western Counties of <HI>England</HI> but at so much Money, which they can raise by a Proportion of 16 <HI>d.</HI> to 20 <HI>d.</HI> at most <HI>per l.</HI> would be unreasonable.</P>
<P>So that it was plain, <HI>Scotland</HI> could not be Taxed at a Pound Rate, but at a Proportioned Summ, leaving them to the Division of it, to raise it as they see fit.</P>
<P N="2">II. The Sum charg'd upon Lands in <HI>England,</HI> after it is le∣vied and raised from the Tenant, stands charg'd with large De∣ductions
<PB N="38" REF="133"/>
and Charges, upon the Levying, Collecting, and Re∣ceiving; and those Charges, if some Calculations are right, amount to little less than 9 <HI>d. per l.</HI> upon the Money receiv'd, besides publick Losses by the Insolvency of Receivers and their Securities, which oftentimes runs deep into the Money; and which tho' they cannot be brought into an exact Account, yet put all together, 12 <HI>d. per</HI> Pound may at least very well be Charg'd upon the whole, as an Off-Reckoning or Discount up∣on the Money, between the Collection and Exchequer.</P>
<P>This 12 <HI>d. per</HI> Pound upon the Money Collected is 2 <HI>d.</HI> 8/20 <HI>per</HI> Pound upon all the Rents in <HI>England,</HI> and amounts in every Land Tax to near a Hundred Thousand Pound <HI>Sterling.</HI></P>
<P>Now as on the other hand, the <HI>Scots</HI> Collect all their Tax at their own Charges, clear of all Losses, Deficiencies or Defalca∣tions, and pay it in Nett to the Exchequer or Publick Trea∣sure, to Charge them by the same Numerical Equality with <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> would be to make them pay their Taxes clear of Charge, and bear part of the Expence and Loss in Collecting ours.</P>
<P N="3">III. Differing Customs and Manners of paying Rent, and letting out Lands in the two Kingdoms, make a Numerical Equality Impracticable.</P>
<P>In <HI>England</HI> the Rents are paid in Mony, in <HI>Scotland</HI> they are, generally speaking, paid in Kind, or Victual, as they call it: Now tho' 'tis true this may, and is, in some respect, brought to a Head by a General Valuation, yet, with this Difference, against a <HI>Scots</HI> Landlord to an <HI>English, viz.</HI> That the <HI>Scots</HI> Land∣lord stays two Terms, and runs two Risques in his receiving the Rent of his Land.</P>
<P>First he stays the Term agreed to receive of his Tenant, and secondly he trusts the Merchant a second Term, to whom he sells the Produce he receives of his Tenant; in the same Sense he runs two Hazards; one in the Solvency of the Tenant, and the other of the Merchant; which makes a considerable Difference in the Essential Value of the Rent, and consequently of the Pur∣chase of such an Estate; and tho' the Purchase or Real Va∣lue of Lands in <HI>Scotland</HI> may not come into this Dispute; yet were an Estate let in <HI>England</HI> to pay the Rent in Kind, it would sell for much less than an Estate of the same Value paid in Spe∣cie: Nor would it be Tax'd at near so much in our Common Assessment.</P>
<P N="4">IV. The Difference in letting Lands in <HI>England,</HI> which are in many Places fin'd down, and the stated Rents reduc'd, makes another Variation: Whereas in <HI>Scotland</HI> Lands are let without Leases, or but on short Terms, and at a Rack-Rent; any Man that knows what belongs to Letting or Taking Lands in <HI>Eng∣land</HI> cannot be ignorant—, That the Landlord, letting a long Lease to the Tenant, confining him to such and such Im∣provement, makes frequent Considerations in the Rent, and so the Land being Taxed by the Rent, is Taxed under the Value.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="134"/>
On the other hand, should this Article of 4 <HI>s. per l.</HI> be insist∣ed on in the literal Sence, and the <HI>Scots</HI> come to consider how to avoid it, by Fining down Rents and other Advantageous Methods, which they may easily find out, they might soon e∣vade the Act, and pay little or nothing; and this would be an Evil hard to discover; and if found out, almost impossible to cure.</P>
<P>From these Reasons it was plain, a Numerical or Arithmetical Equality could not be the Foundation of those Debates—; But as it was very well Stiled, it behoved to be a Geometrical Equality, founded on a Scale of Proportions, and that Scale for∣med upon due Considerations, not of real Value only, but of Circumstances and Prospects of either Kingdom.</P>
<P>A second Calculate was then proposed from the Proportion which <HI>Scotland</HI> was oblig'd to pay under <HI>Oliver Cromwel,</HI> who having reduc'd <HI>Scotland</HI> by Arms, Incorporated them into one Body with this Nation; and by this Incorporation they were Rated at 6000 <HI>l. per</HI> Month in their Land Tax, when <HI>England</HI> was Rated at 70000 <HI>l. per</HI> Month.</P>
<P>It also appears by the same Calculation, that <HI>Scotland</HI> paid this 6000 <HI>l. per</HI> Month, when <HI>England</HI> paid but 35000 <HI>l. per</HI> Month.</P>
<P>Now to apply this Calculation to the present case, the Land Tax in <HI>England</HI> in time of War, at 4 <HI>s. per l.</HI> is suppos'd to raise two Millions <HI>sterling.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Scots</HI> paying 6000 to <HI>Englands</HI> 35000 <HI>per</HI> Month, which is something less than a sixth part; By the same Rule in two Mil∣lions <HI>per Annum,</HI> which the said Land Tax raises, they must be chargeable with 333333. 6. 8. <HI>per Annum,</HI> Land Tax.</P>
<P>But this Arbitray difference which <HI>Oliver Cromwel</HI> and his Parliament made; as is observ'd, was, <HI>In consideration that</HI> Eng∣land <HI>had, for Divers years past, been at almost all the Expence of War;</HI> Yet still, at the former Calculation, <HI>Scotland</HI> would in a four Shilling Aid, pay half that Sum, <HI>viz.</HI> 166666. 13. 4. <HI>per Annum.</HI></P>
<P>Now to examine the Rents of each Kingdom, the Annual Rents of Lands in <HI>Scotland,</HI> must by the first Calculation, amount to One Million, Six Hundred, Sixty Six Thousand, Six Hundred, Sixty Six Pound, Thirteen and Four Pence Sterling, <HI>per Annum,</HI> and by the last Calculation just half the Money.</P>
<P>Both which Sums it was alleaged are far wide of an Equality, and far beyond what <HI>Scotland</HI> is able to raise.</P>
<P>I am the larger on this Head, that Posterity may see the Rea∣sons why these Calculations were made, and have the Arguments preserved for their use, if it be Disputed hereafter, why <HI>Scot∣land</HI> should pay so small a Proportion in the Land Taxes or four Shilling Aid, and which may help others to Defend <HI>Scotland</HI> against future Attempts, to enlarge their Expences.</P>
<P>The next thing was to Examine what was, or what might be counted a due Equality; and here it will be necessary to enter
<PB N="40" REF="135"/>
a little into the short History of Taxes in <HI>Scotland,</HI> since the Re∣storation; which, bringing it down to the present Time, may serve as a Rule to this Matter.</P>
<P>Anciently the levying Money upon Land in <HI>Scotland,</HI> was called in General <HI>the Taxation;</HI> and the manner of levying it was by Rules altogether obsolete and now grown out of Use, as the Custom of Tenths, Fifteenths, Subsidies, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The now Method of Taxing Land has its beginning, as to Practice, in the Assessment of 6000 <HI>l. per</HI> Month, settle in <HI>Scot∣land</HI> in <HI>Cromwel</HI>'s time, when an Union was actually form'd and settled between the Nations; of which, however deficient in it self, without doubt this may be said, that it had in it the Essen∣tial Parts, and might be modell'd into a compleat Coalition.</P>
<P>This is the Tax they now go by in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and is called there THE CESS, by which is understood <HI>a Month's Assessment;</HI> 'tis raised upon Land by a Method peculiarly exact, and I have never heard any one complain of the Inequality.</P>
<P>'Tis raised, as is before noted, without any Charge, Deducti∣on, or Defalcation, and is paid <HI>Nett</HI> into the Treasury.</P>
<P>According as the Occasions of the Government require, this Tax is encreased; but then not the Sum <HI>per</HI> Month is encreased, but the number of Months are encreased, which by the help of time encreases the Sum.</P>
<P>The Original of the Demand was as before, and of the Me∣thod, but the Continuance of it was thus introduced;</P>
<P>In former times, the Kings of <HI>Scotland</HI> contented themselves with the ancient Demesnes, Crown-Lands, Customs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and on extraordinary Cases <HI>the Taxation, as above,</HI> was their Supply, Excises of any sort were altogether unknown, till the Days of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second.</P>
<P>King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second in the Year 1661, obtained of the <HI>Scots</HI> to give him a settled Sum of 40000 <HI>l.</HI> Sterling during his Life, in consideration whereof, he promised never to demand any Cess or <HI>Taxation,</HI> except in time of War, as by the Words of the Act as follows—.</P>

This 40000 <HI>l.</HI> was raised by 8000 <HI>l.</HI> laid as Impost on Fo∣reign Importations, and 32000 <HI>l. per Annum,</HI> on Malt, brewed into Liquor for Sale; but as this was a Novelty and uncertain in its Produce, a Cess was granted to make good the Deficiency, which Deficiency generally amounted to 2 Months Cess more or less, and other Cess than this <HI>Scotland</HI> knew none till the Convention 1666, which being a Time of War, a Cess was imposed, but not exceeding 3 Months.</P>
<P>Here it may be observ'd, That in these times the Excises and Customs of <HI>Scotland</HI> could not raise 40000 <HI>l. per Annum,</HI> put together; which I note for the other Uses which I shall make of it hereafter: but to go on with my History.</P>
<P>From this time to the Year 1678, <HI>Scotland</HI> had no more Cess, nor was at any Charge more than to make good the Deficiency of the 40000 <HI>l.</HI> mentioned before; except 3 Months Cess during the <HI>Dutch</HI> War, expiring at <HI>Candlemas,</HI> 1674:</P>
<P>About this time, the Nation being very unhappily divided into Parties, had the Misfortune, not only to have a Religious Division, but a Court Division also; and People strove at any Price to oblige the Sovereign in giving up their Priviledges and Liberties to be trampled on by Arbitrary Designs. The first Fruits of this Courting the Prince, appear'd in that they brought a Tax 5 Months Cess upon the Country to be continued for 5 Years; which, <HI>tho' in time of Peace,</HI> was back'd with a specious Pretence of the Dis-affection of the <HI>Phanaticks,</HI> or to express it in a more modern Phrase, <HI>The Danger of the Church,</HI> as follows:</P>

<P>In this Taxation or Cess the several Court Parties struggled, who should give their Country away fastest, the Bishops got in∣to every part of the Civil Jurisdiction; the Severities against the People first drove them into Desparations and Rebellions, and then such Advantages were taken, and such use made of the said Insurrections to ruine others, that the poor People were brought to the Brink of general Ruine: the Nation being brought to that pass, that a Man might be fin'd or <HI>for faulted;</HI> that is, his Estate taken from him, for his Wives giving a Half-penny at his Door to a common Beggar, on pretence it was relieving a Rebel.</P>
<P>Thus poor <HI>Scotland</HI> was bought and sold, and the Example is useful for our Observation a great many ways; for thus shall every Nation be used, that is divided into contending Parties, and expos'd to an encroaching Government.</P>
<P>But that I may not have said all this foreign to the present Purpose, it is very observable, <HI>and this is the Reason of the Quo∣tation,</HI> that this will make one PERIOD for Taxation, <HI>viz.</HI> the
<PB N="43" REF="138"/>
highest that an Arbitrary Prince back'd with a Mercenary Nobi∣lity, and a Governing Clergy, even in the greatest Extream of Absolute Tyranny, ever impos'd upon this Nation, which at that time 'tis evident they desir'd to squeeze, and car'd not if they entirely ruin'd.</P>
<P>Come we now to the Revolution, which these Exorbitances had no little Influence upon; the first thing Transacted upon the Meeting of the Estates or Convention of <HI>Scotland,</HI> was to break these Chains; re-assume the Power of raising Taxes by Parliament, and make themselves Judges both of the Occasion, and of the Sum.</P>
<P>However as in <HI>England</HI> since the Revolution, greater Occasi∣ons have call'd for immense Sums to carry on the War; and such Taxes have been rais'd as were never heard of before; so in <HI>Scotland</HI> the Parliament have agreed to such Taxes, as, the aforesaid Time of Tyranny excepted, were never known in <HI>Scotland</HI> before.</P>
<P>Yet, in the carrying on this War, six or seven Months Cess, has, one time with another, been thought <HI>Scotland</HI>'s full Pro∣portion, and the late KING, excepting one or two Years on ex∣traordinary Occasions, always contented himself with it, and this at the same time that <HI>England</HI> rais'd 4 <HI>s. per l.</HI> upon their Land; Nor did Queen <HI>Anne</HI> ever demand more of her Subjects in <HI>Scotland,</HI> tho' the Weight of the War was as great as ever, and this was called another PERIOD of Taxation.</P>
<P>Now, what was mean't by a Geometrical Scale, or Equali∣ty in Taxes, is drawn from these Proportions.</P>
<P>That, since exact Valuation of Rents cannot be made on both sides, and least of all in <HI>England,</HI> it seems as good a way to come at this Equality, as any could be proposed.</P>
<P>That the highest Period of Taxes that ever <HI>Scotland</HI> bore since the Restoration, may be taken on one hand, and set a∣gainst the highest Period of Taxes that ever <HI>England</HI> bore, <HI>that is,</HI> of a Land Tax on both sides; and put these together as the Scale of Equality.</P>
<P>Thus suppose the <HI>Scots</HI> 8 Months Cess, tho' that was the heighth of Tyrannick Imposition, and tho' 'tis allowed the <HI>Scots</HI> are manifestly impoverish'd, and less able to bear it than they were; yet say, it be full 8 Months Cess, and set this against the <HI>English</HI> 4 <HI>s. per l.</HI> it could not be found, that any more just Calculation could be made; And the Proportion seem'd so clear, that every side appeared content with it.</P>
<P>Thus when ever a Tax upon Land for 4 <HI>s. per</HI> Pound is grant∣ed, the <HI>Scots</HI> pay 8 Months Cess, if of 2 <HI>s. per</HI> Pound in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> 4 Months Cess; and so in Proportion.</P>
<P>There were other Calculations offered about that time, but none seemed so rationally and so exactly stated to the Circum∣stances of the Nations, or built on so just a Foundation; and therefore it met with less Difficulty than was expected, as will appear hereafter.</P>

<P>THE Lord Keeper, in the Name of the Lords Commissioners for <HI>England,</HI> delivered to the Board their Answer to the Paper delivered by the Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> the 17th Instant, which was Read.</P>
<P>THE Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> on the 9th instant, pro∣posed a <HI>Quota</HI> of a Land Tax, and agreed to the same Regulations of Trade, and to an Equality of Customs; and on the 13th agreed to an Equality of Excises on all Exciseable Liquors; but, at the same time, their Lordships propos'd an Exemption from all other Burthens and Excises, for a competent time.</P>
<P>THE Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> did the same Day return Answer, That their Lordships would enter into the Consideration of the particular Excises and Burthens, Point by Point, and on the 15th Instant did return their Answer distinctly, to the particular Excises and Burthens payable by virtue of several Acts of Par∣liament in <HI>England,</HI> in such manner, as their Lordships had reason to hope, would have been to the entire Satisfaction of the Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland;</HI> But the Lords Commissioners for <HI>Eng∣land</HI> finding, by the Paper delivered in on the 17th Instant by the Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland,</HI> that tho' they do take notice of the said Answer of the 15th; yet their Lordships have thought fit to renew their Proposal of a general Exemption for some competent time, from all other Excises and Burthens, besides these their Lord∣ships had already consented to: The Lords Commissioners for <HI>Eng∣land</HI> did understand that Proposal of the 13th, to extend only to such other Burthens and Excises, as are now subsisting in <HI>England,</HI> to every one of which their Lordships think they have given a full and distinct Answer; and if it shall appear, that any Particulars have been omitted in that Answer, the Lords Commissioners for <HI>England,</HI> will enter into the Consideration of them, and return their Opinion thereupon; But if the Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> would ex∣tend their Proposal of the 13th to an Exemption from all Burthens and Excises, which the Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> may hereafter find necessary to Impose on the United Kingdom; The Lords Com∣missioners for <HI>England</HI> are of Opinion, that it cannot be suppos'd, the Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> will ever lay any sort of Burthens up∣on the United Kingdom, but what they shall find of necessity at that time, for the Preservation and Good of the whole, and with due Re∣gard to the Circumstances and Abilities of every part of the United Kingdom; and to allow of any Supposition to the contrary, would be to form and set up an unanswerable Argument against the Union it self; Therefore the Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> do Desire, That the Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> would take into their Conside∣ration, the several Particulars in that Paper delivered to them by the Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> on the 15th Instant, and return such Answer to them as their Lordships shall think fit.</P>

<P>THE Lord Chancellor, in Name of the Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland,</HI> deliver'd to the Board their Lordships Answer to the Papers deliver'd by the Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> the 15th and 18th Instant, which was Read.</P>
<P>THE Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> have taken into their Consideration, the Papers delivered by the Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> on the 15th and 18th Instant, and do understand that the First contains all the several kind of Burthens and Excises now in use in <HI>England,</HI> besides those to which the Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> have already agreed.</P>
<P>And as to the several particulars contain'd in the said Papers.</P>
<P N="1">1. As to Duties on Stampt Paper, Vellom and Parchment, seing the Exemption from that Imposition can have no Influence on Trade or Manufacturies, and that the said Duty does affect the Securities of the Subjects Estates, adding likewise a new Condition, which being omitted may make their Rights and Titles void: And further considering, that the said Duty will be uneasie to the People, chargeable in collecting, and of small value; The Lords Commis∣sioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> do propose, That the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland</HI> be wholly exempted from the same, or at least that the Exemption from the said Duties, agreed to by the Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> in the said Paper of the 15th Instant, be prolong'd beyond the Year 1710, to a certain Period, as to that Moiety which is imposed for Perpetuity.</P>
<P N="2">2. As to the other particular Duties which expire in the Year 1710 or sooner, from which the Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> have agreed, that the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland</HI> shall be exempted: The Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> do understand, that it was the Meaning of the Lords Commissioners for <HI>England,</HI> to extend that Exemption to the Duty laid on Cynders.</P>
<P N="3">3. As to the Duty on Salt; The Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> having consented, that the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland</HI> shall, for a compe∣tent time after the Union, remain Exempted from the payment of that Duty, for all Salt spent in kind, or used in Provisions, within the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland,</HI> provided that the Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> should propose effectual Methods for securing, that the like Duties as are now payable in <HI>England,</HI> be Paid and Collected in the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland</HI> after the Union, as to all Salt Exported from that Kingdom, either in Kind or Provisions: The Lords Com∣missioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> have herewith given in a Scheme of such Re∣gulations as have occurr'd to them, for securing, that the Duty pro∣pos'd be collected in <HI>Scotland,</HI> as to all Salt Exported from that Kingdom in Kind or Provisions, and are willing to agree to what other Methods shall be propos'd on that behalf by the Lords Com∣missioners for <HI>England;</HI> And their Lordships are ready to enter with the Lords Commissioners for <HI>England,</HI> on the Consideration of the time to which the said Exemption shall be limited; And the
<PB N="46" REF="141"/>
Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> doubt not, but as the Lords Com∣missioners for <HI>England</HI> have agreed to the Exemption propos'd from all Burthens or Excises now in use, but those consented to by the Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland,</HI> That the Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> will also agree, That the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland</HI> remain Ex∣empted from any Duties (except these agreed to) which may be laid on by the Parliament of <HI>England</HI> before the Union.</P>
<P>AND as to the General Exemption formerly propos'd on the part of <HI>Scotland,</HI> from all other Burtheus than those consented to for a com∣petent time. The Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> considering what the Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> have observ'd, that it cannot be suppos'd the Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> will ever lay any sort of Burthens upon the United Kingdom, but what they shall find of necessity at that time, for the Preservation and Good of the whole, and with due Regard to the Circumstances and Abili∣ties of every part of the United Kingdom. Therefore the Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland,</HI> to avoid the Difficulty that may arise in that Matter, do agree, not to insist further at present, but to leave the Continuation of the said Exemption to be determin'd by the Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain.</HI></P>
<P>AND the Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> having, by this and their former Papers, Answer'd the Proposal made by the Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> on the 29th <HI>April,</HI> concerning the Equa∣lity of Taxes, The Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> take this oc∣casion to put the Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> in mind of a Pro∣posal given in to their Lordships the 9th Instant, concerning the <HI>Quota</HI> of Land-Tax for the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland,</HI> not doubting, but that the Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> will agree to the same.</P>
<P>THE Lord Chancellor did also, in Name of the Lords Commis∣sioners for <HI>Scotland,</HI> deliver to the Board the following Proposal, which was read.</P>
<P>PROPOSAL for the effectual preventing the Exportation of <HI>Scots</HI> Salt to <HI>England,</HI> or the Plantations, without paying the same Ex∣cises, with which <HI>English</HI> Salt is charg'd, during the Exemption al∣lowed to <HI>Scotland</HI> from the said Duty.</P>
<P N="1">1. THAT no Salt be Transported from <HI>Scotland</HI> to <HI>England</HI> by Land, under the Penalty of Forfeiting the Salt and the Horses used in Transporting it, and pay ten Shillings for every Bushel of Salt so Transported, for which the Carrier, as well as the Owner, shall be lyable Conjunctly and Severally, and the Carriers to be Imprison'd until the said Penalty be paid.</P>
<P N="2">2. That all Salt Water-born be enter'd at a Custom Office, and that before Shipping there be a Report made, expressing to what Port the Ship or Vessel is bound, and if bound to any Port within <HI>Scotland,</HI> there shall be sufficient Security given for the Duty payable in six Moneths, with this condition, that in case a Certificate be re∣turned from the Collector or Collectors where the Ship or Vessel is bound, that the same Quantity was truly and without Fraud found Loaded at the saids Port or Ports, reasonable Allowance being made
<PB N="47" REF="142"/>
for Waste since the Embarkation; Then and in that Case the Bond for the Duty to be come void: And in case the Ship or Vessel be bound for <HI>England</HI> or the Plantations, The Excise or Duty chargeable on the like Salt in <HI>England</HI> shall be presently paid in Money, and a Transire or Certificate Subscribed by the Collector, expressing the quantity of Salt Enter'd and the Duty paid; and if any Ship or Vessel Load Salt on Board, and Export the same without duly Reporting, Entring and carrying the said Transire or Certificate along with him, to be produced at the Port of Discharge; The Ship or Vessel unload∣ing shall be confiscated, and the Master Imprison'd for three Months, and in case of any Fraud or Connivance in the Collector or other Of∣ficers of the Custom-house, the said Collector or other Officer shall be lyable to pay a years Sallary, and be deprived of his Office.</P>
<P N="3">3. As to Provisions; All Fishes and Flesh Barrel'd for Exportation, are appointed to be Packt and Cured with Forreign Salt without any Mixture of <HI>Scotch</HI> or <HI>English</HI> Salt, by the Law of <HI>Scotland,</HI> which Forreign Salt falls under the Regulation of Forreign Trade, and there are no other valuable Provisions that can be Imported from <HI>Scotland;</HI> and the Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> are willing to agree to any further Proposal that shall be made for preventing Fraud, in Importing <HI>Scotch</HI> Salt or salted Provisions.</P>
<P><HI>Her Majesty came to the Meeting, and being seated in her Chair, spoke to the Lords Commissioners as followeth.</HI><Q><P><HI>My Lords,</HI></P>
<P>I Am so much concerned for the UNION of the two Kingdoms, That I could not satisfie my self without coming before I went out of Town, to see what Progress you had made in the Treaty, and to recommend very earnestly to you the bringing it to a happy Conclusion, with as much dispatch as the nature of it will admit, not doubting of the General satisfaction which my Subjects of both Kingdoms will receive in finding you overcome all difficulties to at∣tain so great and publick a Good.</P></Q></P>
<P>THE Lord Keeper desired to know of Her Majesty, if she would be pleas'd to hear the Proposals made on either side, and the Resoluti∣ons hitherto taken thereupon, read by the respective Secretaries; which her Majesty was pleased to allow of, and the same were Read accordingly.</P>
<P>After Reading whereof, Her Majesty went away, and the Lords Commissioners Adjourned to <HI>Thursday</HI> the 23d Instant, 10 a Clock in the Morning.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATION VI.</HEAD>
<P>And thus after all the Difficulties which were thought Un∣surmountable by some, and endeavoured to be made so by others, the Affair of the Land Tax was settled; The next Article was the
<PB N="48" REF="143"/>
Equality of Excises, Customs and other appropriated Funds, and these had sundry Difficulties.</P>
<P>Some were grievous to <HI>Scotland</HI> with respect to their Magni∣tude only, in which case tho' <HI>Scotland</HI> was to be supposed to pay Duties under the same Denominations, yet the <HI>Scots</HI> Com∣missioners pretended to insist upon it, that they were not able to pay the same Sums with <HI>England,</HI> but that it must be reduced to a proportioned Equality as in the Land Tax, and this respected the Excise and several Branches of the Customs.</P>
<P>Others were grievous to <HI>Scotland</HI> in the kind, and were thought Impracticable, at least for a time, the Trade, Poverty, and other Circumstances of <HI>Scotland</HI> not admitting them, these were the Tax upon Malt, and the Excise, or Duty on Salt.</P>
<P>Others again were such as were altogether Impracticable, as having none of the Materials to work on in <HI>Scotland,</HI> or such as could not rationally be expected from them, such as the Taxes upon Coals, Culm, Hawkers and Pedlars, Hakney-Coach-Men, Births, Burials, and Marriages, Glass-Windows, Stampt-Paper, and the like.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the Debate on these Heads, the Equality of Customs, Export and Import, with the same Restrictions and Regulations of Trade was Agreed to by the <HI>Scots</HI> Commissioners; for the necessity of Commerce made it plain, there could be no adjusting Trade without that. An open free uninterrupted Com∣merce by Land being the Consequence of an Union, they would otherwise ruine the <HI>English</HI> Trade, by supplying the <HI>English</HI> Markets with all sorts of Imported Goods, cheaper than the <HI>English</HI> Mer∣chants could do; and this would be a most destructive Article in Trade, especially in fine Goods. For Example, in Linens from <HI>Ham∣borough</HI> or <HI>Holland,</HI> or in Tobacco, Coffee, Tea, Chacolate, and such other things as were then under large Duty and small Car∣riage; these would all be spread over <HI>England</HI> by the <HI>Scots,</HI> and make unspeakable Confusions in Trade.</P>
<P>It was the sooner concluded therefore, that the Customs, Pro∣hibitions, and Charges of all foreign Importations, must be nu∣merically and literally the same in both Nations. But as the <HI>English</HI> Customs were already Impropriated to pay the <HI>English</HI> Debts, and the <HI>Scots</HI> had before proposed, that neither Kingdom be burthened with the Debts of the other Contracted before the Union; this Equality was found very difficult; and next to Impracticable, and this brought on the affair of an Equivalent; of which hereafter.</P>
<P>This now run thro' all the Heads of Taxes, for there remained no Question, but that an Equivalent was a full Compensation for any Difficulty proposed; and yet the settling an Equivalent here seem'd no Satisfaction. It was alleged an Equivalent was a Na∣tional Satisfaction indeed, but not a personal, that it could not relieve the particular People it Oppressed, no, nor make good the Damage of the particular Trade it would injure; and
<PB N="49" REF="144"/>
therefore the <HI>Scots</HI> Commissioners strove hard to avoid the Taxes wholly, rather than to come into them tho' with an Equiva∣lent—, but it was not to be done; there could be no other Method that could make both sides equally Easy.</P>
<P>After this had therefore been long Discours'd, the <HI>Scots</HI> Commissio∣ners came in to the Article of Equality of Excises on Liquors, &amp; the Customs on Exported and Imported Goods, the Debate of what that Equality was did not ly before them, but seem'd referr'd on both sides to the respective Parliaments, and there we shall meet with it again at large.</P>
<P>The Customs &amp; Excises on Liquors being thus settled, the <HI>Scots</HI> Commissioners Excepted against all other Excises &amp; Burthens, and insisted upon it as a Thing <HI>Scotland</HI> was not then in a Condition to come into, at least for the present, as you see it expressed in the Minuts of <HI>May</HI> 13. And it is observable the <HI>Scots</HI> Commissioners made this Proposal with a great deal of Candor and Regard to the <HI>English,</HI> as appears by their obviating the Objection which they knew would be made of the Carrying Salt and Malt into <HI>Eng∣land;</HI> for it was the particular Duties on Salt and Malt which they had an Eye to in this Proposal, in which they desired Ex∣emption for so much only as should be consumed in <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>Upon this occasion the Committee was appointed to Examine and State the Nature of the Equivalent, and on which particu∣lar Articles it was to be allowed; And as this was doing, the Commissioners in their Meeetings went upon the particular Points of Excises, or Taxes which were to be objected against.</P>
<P>The Stampt Paper, the Births, Burials, Windows, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> were without much Difficulty conceded to the <HI>Scots;</HI> for as the Cir∣cumstances of those Duties made them improper, so the Stampt Duties could not have been extended to <HI>Scotland,</HI> the Methods and Customs of which would have made it Impracticable in some Cases, and Intolerable in others.</P>
<P>The Duties on Coals, Culm, and Cinders, also occasioned very small Debates, the <HI>Scots</HI> being no otherwise Exempted from those Duties, than a great part of <HI>England</HI> is, who pay no Duty for all their River-born Coals; and the Quantity of Coals carried by Sea in <HI>Scotland,</HI> is so very small as not to deserve any notice; Howbeit all the Coal Exported from <HI>Scotland,</HI> or <HI>Scots</HI> Coal Ex∣pended in <HI>England,</HI> pays as in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The Births and Burial Act expired, and having been grievous in <HI>England,</HI> it was not probable it should be Renewed.</P>
<P>The Hakney-Coach-Mens Act could not concern <HI>Scotland,</HI> there being so few Hakney-Coaches in <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> as not to make it worth notice.</P>
<P>The Malt and Salt Tax occasioned the greatest Debate, the Circumstances of <HI>Scotland</HI> were argued, tho' with great Modesty and Decency, on either side; and the <HI>English</HI> Commissioners were soon made sensible, That, in the present Circumstances of <HI>Scotland,</HI> those Duties could not be born there.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="145"/>
And indeed they would have been intolerable to the Poor, and not only as to the Magnitude, but as the manner of Taxing them had been particularly Oppressive to the <HI>Scots</HI> in their Trade.</P>
<P N="1">1. Because they are Exorbitant in their Rate, being Charg'd not upon the Value, but upon the Bulk of the Commodity; and the Goods bearing so different a Value in <HI>Scotland</HI> and in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> to put the Duty equal, would be to Tax the <HI>Scots</HI> in three times the Sum they are Tax'd at in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>For Example, the Duty upon Salt is charg'd by Weight in general, and this being Calculated in <HI>Scotland,</HI> would amount to 16 <HI>s.</HI> 4 <HI>d.</HI> Sterling, upon 3 <HI>s.</HI> value, and in <HI>England</HI> to but 16 <HI>s.</HI> 4 <HI>d.</HI> Sterling, upon 10 <HI>s.</HI> 6 <HI>d.</HI> Value, or thereabout; let any Man state the Proportion, here they will easily allow the Tax to be intolerable to the <HI>Scots;</HI> since by the same Proporti∣on the <HI>English</HI> ought to pay 2 <HI>l.</HI> 17 <HI>s.</HI> 4 <HI>d.</HI> for the same quantity of Salt, or the <HI>Scots</HI> ought to pay but 4 <HI>s.</HI> 8 <HI>d.</HI> for that which by this Tax is rated at 16 <HI>s.</HI> 4 <HI>d.</HI> and the like, tho not in so great a Difference, for the Malt.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Weight of the Salt Tax lyes especially on the Poor, who in <HI>Scotland</HI> live very much on Salt Meats, and whose dif∣fering Condition from the <HI>English</HI> does not permit, nor cannot bear being Tax'd at all, much less equal to the <HI>English.</HI></P>
<P>These Arguments brought the <HI>English</HI> Commissioners to agree to an Exemption for a time, the <HI>Scots</HI> Commissioners insisted upon an Exemption to perpetuity, but the Answer of the <HI>English</HI> Commissioners stated in the Minuts of the 13<HI>th May</HI> is very clear, and obliged the <HI>Scots</HI> Commissioners to Acquiesce.</P>
<P>For it could not be thought reasonable to tye up the Hands of the United Kingdom for ever, not to lay on such Duties or Taxes as the Circumstances of Trade and of the Nation, might make reasonable.</P>
<P>The Treaters on both sides therefore Acquiesced in the Ex∣emption from the other several Duties during the respective Terms they were given for; leaving the Consideration of further Exemptions to the <HI>British</HI> Parliament, what Alteration this part received, and upon what Consideration in the Parliament ensu∣ing in <HI>Scotland,</HI> shall appear in its place—.</P>
<P>There was an Objection offered here about what Duties might be laid on by the very next Parliament of <HI>England,</HI> which being to sit almost at the same time with the Parliament in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and consequently before the Union could Commence, might alter the state of the present Duties; And so the Conclusions might be all to be made over again.</P>
<P>But this was after some Debate Regulated as <HI>per</HI> the Minuts, by obliging <HI>Scotland</HI> to raise her part of the Charge of the Year 1707, as usual, and <HI>England</HI> her part, each separately and a part, and the several Duties and Funds mentioned, were to remain just as they stood at the time of the Treaty.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="146"/>
This, and the <HI>Quota</HI> of Land-Tax being brought in together, was readily Agreed to on both sides.</P>
<P>And thus this great Difficulty, which was thought the most dangerous in the whole Treaty, was brought into a very narrow Compass; For the Business was now, only to state the matter of the Equivalent, what it should be, and how to be disposed.</P>
<P>What it should be, admitted no long Debate; For, as it was a payment of Money, nothing but Money could be an E∣quivalent to it.</P>
<P>How much it was to be, depended upon Matter of Fact, and was reserv'd to exact Calculation from the Foot of the Customs and Excise.</P>
<P>As to the manner how it should be disposed, the Commis∣sioners did not adjust it at all, save in Generals, of which here∣after in its Course.</P>
<P>It has been objected indeed, as an Omission in the Commis∣sioners, That they did not adjust the Application of the Equi∣valent in <HI>Scotland;</HI> But their Reasons were, 1. Because they had a Respect to the Parliament of <HI>Scotland</HI> who were to come after them, and who perhaps might enter farther into that part, and indeed might claim a Right exclusive of all others to dis∣pose of it.</P>
<P N="2">2. They were not willing to enter upon a thing, in which the Determination of Properties might be entangled, conceiv∣ing it did not ly before them to conclude private Interests, or exclude any, <HI>as they might have done,</HI> who had Reason to claim upon old Debts, some in King <HI>James</HI>'s Time, and some in King <HI>Charles</HI>'s Time, and the like.</P>
<P N="3">3. It was thought, this might raise Objections against the Union in People, who, being byass'd by their Interest, would oppose the General Interest on their own particular Accounts.</P>
<P>It was now that the Union appear'd hopeful, and People be∣gan to be surprized at the Success; The Queen Her self, pleas∣ed with the Prospect, came to the Meeting, and hearing the Minuts Read, Expressed an Extraordinary Satisfaction in the Steps taken by the Commissioners, and the Hopes conceived of bringing this Great Matter to a Happy Conclusion.</P>

<P>The Lord Keeper, in Name of the Lords Commissioners for <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> deliver'd to the Board the followng Answer to the Paper de∣livered by the Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland,</HI> the 21<HI>st</HI> Instant, which was Read.</P>
<P>The Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> having considered the Papers deliver'd by the Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland,</HI> on the 21<HI>st</HI> Instant, and being desirous to remove all Difficulties in this Treaty, return this Answer.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="147"/>
That whereas the Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> have already consented, That the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland</HI> be exempted from the whole Duty on stampt Paper, Vellom and Parchment till the 1<HI>st</HI> of <HI>August</HI> 1710, at which time one part thereof expires; The Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> do now consent, That the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland</HI> shall not be charged with the other part of that Duty dur∣ing the continuance of that Duty by any Act now in Force.</P>
<P>And do Agree, It was and is the Intent of the Lords Commissio∣ners for <HI>England,</HI> That the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland</HI> be exempted from the payment of the Duty laid on Cynders, in such manner as the Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> have before agreed, That the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland</HI> be exempted from the payment of the Duty on Coal and Culm.</P>
<P>And as to the Scheme proposed by the Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland,</HI> for securing, that the Duty on Salt now payable in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> be collected in <HI>Scotland</HI> after the Union, as to all Salt export∣ed from that Kingdom in Kind, or Provisions; The Lords Commis∣sioners for <HI>England</HI> have thought it necessary to receive some Infor∣mation concerning that Matter, from the Officers principally concern'd in the Management of that Duty; and until the Lords Commissio∣ners for <HI>England</HI> can be satisfyed concerning the Sufficiency of these or other Methods for the end propos'd, They conceive they cannot properly enter with the Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> on the Consideration of the time, to which the Exemption of <HI>Scotland</HI> from that Duty shall be Limited.</P>
<P>And as to the Duty which may be laid on by the Parliament of <HI>England,</HI> before the Meeting of the Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> for the Service of the Year 1707: The Lords Commissioners for <HI>Eng∣land</HI> do agree, that the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland</HI> shall not be charged with those Duties, upon this Consideration, that the Parliament of <HI>Scotland</HI> do make the necessary Provision for the publick Charge and Service of the Year 1707 in that Kingdom, provided, that if the Parliament of <HI>England</HI> shall think fit to lay a further Charge on the Customs, or those Excises, of which the Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> have agreed to bear equal Burthens in such cases; The Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> propose the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland</HI> be ly∣able to the same Customs and Excises, having an Equivalent to be settled by the Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain:</HI> And as to the <HI>Quota</HI> of a Land Tax for the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland,</HI> propos'd by the Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland,</HI> the Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> do agree, that whenever the Summe of 1997763 <HI>lib.</HI> 8 <HI>sh.</HI> 4½<HI>d.</HI> shall be enacted by the Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> to be rais'd in <HI>Eng∣land</HI> on Land, and other things usually charg'd in Acts of Parlia∣ment, for granting an Aid to the Crown by Land-Tax, the King∣dom of <HI>Scotland</HI> shall be charged by the same Act with the further Summe of <HI>lib.</HI> 48000 as the <HI>Quota</HI> of that Kingdom to such Tax, and so proportionably for any greater or lesser Summe rais'd on the Kingdom of <HI>England</HI> by any Tax upon Land, and other things usu∣ally charg'd together with the Land.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATION VII.</HEAD>
<P>It is very remarkable here, That, in the Exemptions from several Duties in this Treaty, there is a certain Limitation only to the Act then in Force, and to the Time for which these Duties were then laid on; From whence some afterward took Occasion against the Treaters on the <HI>Scots</HI> side, as if they had thereby tacitly con∣sented, that those Duties should be charged upon <HI>Scotland</HI> after the Expiration of the Time Limited.</P>
<P>But they that please to Examine more Nicely into this Mat∣ter, will find it quite otherwise: The <HI>English</HI> Commissioners con∣senting to an Exemption from Taxes to the <HI>Scots,</HI> For, as far as the several Duties debated were laid, seem'd as much as could reasonably be expected they should agree to; since, to have gone farther, had been to abridge the United Parliament that was to follow, and tacitly to acknowledge what was but too frequently suggested, that they would be Partial to the <HI>English,</HI> and consequently might oppress the <HI>Scots;</HI> This was the true Mean∣ing of that part of the Answer the <HI>English</HI> Commissioners gave to the <HI>Scots</HI> Paper, <HI>May</HI> 18, <HI>viz. But if the Lords Commissioners for</HI> Scotland <HI>would extend their Proposal of the</HI> 13th <HI>to an Exempti∣on from all Burthens and Excises, which the Parliament of</HI> Great-Britain <HI>may hereafter find necessary to Impose on the Ʋnited King∣dom; The Lords Commissioners for</HI> England <HI>are of Opinion, That it cannot be suppos'd, the Parliament of</HI> Great-Britain <HI>will ever lay any sort of Burthens upon the Ʋnited Kingdom, but what they shall find of necessity at that time, for the Preservation and Good of the whole, and with due Regard to the Circumstances and Abilities of every part of the Ʋnited Kingdom, and to allow of any Supposi∣tion to the contrary, would be to form and set up an unanswerable Argument against the Ʋnion it self.</HI></P>
<P>This was very happily foreseen, and by this Method pre∣vented; For nothing was more certain, than that this very Argument would be raised, and in the debating this Treaty in <HI>Scotland,</HI> in the Parliament there, it was one of the great Pleas, and thought to be an Unanswerable Argument against the Union, <HI>viz. That the Parliament of</HI> Great-Britain <HI>might and would,</HI> be∣ing byass'd by the Majority of Votes on the <HI>English</HI> side, <HI>lay Burthens on</HI> Scotland, <HI>without Regard to the Circumstances and A∣bility of that part of the Ʋnited Kingdom;</HI> And it would indeed have been an Unanswerable Argument, if the Lords Commissio∣ners had extended their Limitations of Taxes beyond the Ex∣piration of the Acts which were then in being.</P>
<P>Therefore they resolved to leave it indefinite, only with their Concessions, as Reasons for, and Precedents of future Abate∣ments to <HI>Scotland;</HI> And this the Commissioners of <HI>Scotland</HI> found so reasonable, as that they could not indeed object against it,
<PB N="54" REF="149"/>
as to any Duties which the Parliament then in being in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> and which were at hand to fit, <HI>viz.</HI> in <HI>October</HI> next follow∣ing, it was but just to ty them up, and the <HI>English</HI> Commissioners came readily into that; and thus they went on hand in hand, yielding to one another in every thing which might without Injury be granted, and which might in the least contribute to the great and main End of the Treaty <HI>THE ƲNION.</HI></P>
<P>And now they having Clerks appointed to assist them in the Calculations of the Equivalent, which took up a great deal of Time, they were obliged to adjourn the Affair of Funds, Taxes, Proportion of Debts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and go upon other Articles in the mean time.</P>

<P>The Lord Chancellor, in Name of the Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland,</HI> deliver'd to the Board the following Paper, which was Read.</P>
<P>The Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> are very sensible of the Care, which the Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> have taken, to remove Difficulties in this Important Article, concerning common Taxes and Impositions; And their Lordships doubt not, that the Joynt Desires and Endeavours of the Lords Commissioners for both Kingdoms, will bring this Treaty to a good and speedy Conclusion in every Point.</P>
<P>And as to the Particulars contain'd in the Answer, given in by the Lords Commissioners for <HI>England;</HI> the 23<HI>d</HI> Instant; The Lords Com∣missioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> do accept the said Answer as satisfying, as to the Exemption of the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland</HI> from the Duties upon Stampt Paper, Vellom and Parchment, and upon Cynders, and as to the <HI>Quota</HI> of Land Tax for <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>And as to the Article concerning the Salt, The Lords Commissio∣ners for <HI>Scotland</HI> are very well satisfy'd, that the Lords Commissio∣ners for <HI>England</HI> take what time they judge needful for Informing themselves, and preparing the most proper Methods, for securing what their Lordships proposed; The Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scot∣land</HI> being very ready to concur on their part.</P>
<P>As to the Duties which may be laid on by the Parliament of <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> before the Meeting of the Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> The Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> do understand, that the said An∣swer is intended by the Lords Commissioners for <HI>England,</HI> as an Agreement to the Proposal made by the Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland,</HI> That that Kingdom might remain Exempted from all other Duties laid on by the Parliament of <HI>England</HI> before the Union, except these consented to; And the Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> do Agree, That all necessary Provision shall be made within the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland,</HI> for the Charge and Service of that Kingdom, during the time that shall Interveen before the Meeting of the Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain.</HI></P>

<P>And seing the Adjusting of the Equivalent, and settling the Endurance of the Exemption from the Duty on Salt may require some time, the Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> are ready, either to pro∣ceed on these Matters, until they be fully Adjusted, or to enter on the consideration of the Constitution of the Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain;</HI> The Reservation of Laws and Judicatures, or any other remaining Head to be Treated on, as shall be Agreed by the Lords Commissioners for both Kingdoms, while in the mean time the Committee is preparing what lyes before them.</P>

<P>The Lord Chancellor, in the Name of the Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> delivered to the Board the following Proposal, which was Read.</P>
<P>The Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> having already agreed to an Equality of Customs and Excise upon all Exciseable Liquors, and to the same Regulations of Trade thro-out the whole United King∣dom, as a consequence thereof; Their Lordships do now agree, That the Laws concerning Regulation of Trade, Customs and Excise upon all Exciseable Liquors be the same in <HI>Scotland</HI> after the Union, as in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>But the Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> do propose, That all other Laws in Use within the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland</HI> do after the Union, and notwithstanding thereof, remain in the same Force as before, but alterable by the Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> with this difference betwixt the Laws concerning publick Right, Policy and Government, and those which concern private Right; That the Laws which concern publick Right, Policy and Government may be made the same thro-out the whole United Kingdom; But that no alteration be made in the Laws which concern private Right, ex∣cept for evident utility of the Subjects within that part of the United Kingdom now called <HI>Scotland.</HI> And as to the Judicatures within <HI>Scotland,</HI> The Lords Commisioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> do propose as fol∣loweth.</P>
<P>That the Court of Session or College of Justice do after the Union, and notwithstanding thereof, remain in all time coming within <HI>Scotland,</HI> as 'tis now constituted by the Laws of that Kingdom, and with the same Authority and Priviledges as before the Union; subject nevertheless, to such Regulations for the better Administra∣tion of Justice as shall be made by the Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain.</HI></P>
<P>That the Court of Justiciary do also after the Union, and not∣withstanding thereof, remain in all time coming within <HI>Scotland,</HI> as 'tis now constituted by the Laws of that Kingdom, and with the same Authority and Priviledges as before the Union; subject never∣theless, to such Regulations as shall be made by the Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and without prejudice of other Rights of Justiciary.</P>
<P>That all other Courts presently in Being within the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland</HI> do remain, but subject to Alterations by the Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain;</HI> And that all Inferior Courts within the said Limits do remain subordinat, as they now are to the Supreme Courts of Justice within the same, in all time coming.</P>
<P>That no Causes in the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland</HI> be Cognoscible by the Courts of Chancery, Queens Bench, Common Pleas, or any other Court in <HI>Westminster</HI> Hall, and that the said Courts or any others of the like Nature after the Union, shall have no Power to Cognosce, Review, or Alter the Acts or Sentences of the Judicatures within <HI>Scotland,</HI> or stop the Execution of the same.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="152"/>
That there be a Court of Exchequer in <HI>Scotland</HI> after the Union, for deciding Questions concerning the Revenues of Customs and Ex∣cises, having the same Power and Authority, as the Court of Ex∣chequer has in <HI>England,</HI> and that the said Court of Exchequer in <HI>Scot∣land</HI> have Power of passing Signatures, Gifts, Tutories, and in other things, as the Court of Exchequer at present in <HI>Scotland</HI> hath; and that the Court of Exchequer that now is in <HI>Scotland</HI> do remain, until a new Court of Exchequer be settled by the Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> in that Kingdom after the Union.</P>
<P>That after the Union, The Queens Majesty and Her Royal Suc∣cessors may continue a Privy Council in <HI>Scotland,</HI> for preserving of publick Order and Peace, until the Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> shall think fit to alter it, or Establish any other effectual Method for that end.</P>
<P>That all Heretable Offices and Jurisdictions, and Offices or Juris∣dictions for Life be Reserv'd to the Owners thereof, as Right of Property, notwithstanding of this Treaty, in the same manner as they are now Injoy'd by the Law of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>That the Rights and Priviledges of the Royal Burroughs in <HI>Scot∣land,</HI> as they now are, do remain entire after the Union, and not∣withstanding thereof.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATION VIII.</HEAD>
<P>The Reserve of Judicatories in <HI>Scotland</HI> being now the De∣bate, it is needful only to Explain a few things for the Informa∣tion of the Reader, as to the Nature of those Judicatories and Reserves.</P>
<P>It was absolutely necessary to reserve the Laws, Courts of Justice, and Civil or Criminal Judicatories, because the re∣spective Kingdoms being Govern'd by differing Customs, Rites, Laws, and Methods of Justice, it would have infinitely Embar∣rast the Treaty now, and the Kingdoms afterward to have made any Alteration: It would have perfectly put a stop to all publick Justice for a time, and all the Persons bred to the Law in that Kingdom who had changed their Laws, would have been rendred Unable to Practise or Discharge their Duty to their Clients, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and have been by consequence divested of their Livelyhoods; These Difficulties appearing so great, the <HI>English</HI> Commissioners came readily into it, only with a few Restricti∣ons: As
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That all Laws for the Regulating Trade, Customs and Excises, be the same in <HI>Scotland</HI> after the Union as in <HI>Eng∣land;</HI> This was absolutely necessary to be done, <HI>tho' if they should extend the word,</HI> to all Laws for Regulation of Trade it might be run out to difficult Extremes, &amp; occasion an unanswerable Dispute; but moderately speaking, it was absolutely necessary to prevent the confusion among Officers in Collecting the Revenue, stating and settling
<PB N="58" REF="153"/>
the Customs and Excises, which were now to be extend∣ed to both Countries.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Again, it was most necessary that their other Laws should <HI>be alterable by the Parliament of Great Britain,</HI> otherwise this had been to tye up the Hands of the fu∣ture Constitution from making necessary Provision against whatever Inconveniencies might happen in the Govern∣ment; And I mention this here, because in the tumultu∣ary Clamours raised afterwards against the Treaty, and against the Treaters, this was one of the great Quarrels, That they had given up the Laws and Constitution of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and had subjected them to the arbitrary Votes of a <HI>British</HI> Parliament, in which it was alledged, the Majority being so much <HI>English,</HI> the <HI>Scots</HI> could expect nothing but Disadvantage. But it is apparent, and was at the time of the Treaty considered, that the leaving the Laws of <HI>Scotland</HI> subject to Alteration by the <HI>British</HI> Parliament, signified no more than leaving room for the Parliament in Cases of Necessity, or indeed on all oc∣casions, to make Laws for <HI>Scotland,</HI> as should appear need∣ful for the publick Advantage, always reserving their general Form of Law and Proceedings of Justice, as be∣fore; And without this, <HI>Scotland</HI> must have been mise∣rably left without a <HI>Legislature,</HI> and have had no oppor∣tunity to have helped her self in Cases contingent, or have obtained any more or other Laws for the Rectifica∣tion of any of the common Abuses of her Government, which it seems these Objectors did not think it worth their while to consider.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>And that this alone was the meaning of this word, <HI>Alterable by the Parliament of Great Britain,</HI> and that it was understood so on both Hands, is evident from the very words of the Proposal of the <HI>Scots</HI> Commissioners, when they propose the Alternative between publick and private Right—, <HI>With this difference be∣twixt the Laws concerning publick Right, Policy and Government, and those which concern privat Right; That the Laws which con∣cern publick Right, Policy and Government may be made the same thro-out the whole Ʋnited Kingdom; But that no Alteration be made in the Laws which conern privat Right, except for evident utility of the Subjects within that part of the Ʋnited Kingdom now called</HI> Scotland.</P>
<P>The three next Articles do also still more evidently Con∣firm this, <HI>viz. That the Court of Session, or College of Justice, do, af∣ter the Ʋnion, and notwithstanding thereof, remain in all time com∣ing within</HI> Scotland, <HI>as 'tis now Constituted by the Laws of that Kingdom, and with the same Authority and Priviledges as before the Ʋnion; Subject nevertheless, to such Regulations for the better Ad∣ministration of Justice, as shall be made by the Parliament of</HI> Great-Britain.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="154"/>
<HI>That the Court of Justiciary do also, after the Ʋnion, and not∣withstanding thereof, remain in all time coming within</HI> Scotland, <HI>as 'tis now Constituted by the Laws of that Kingdom, and with the same Authority and Priviledges as before the Ʋnion; Subject never∣theless, to such Regulations as shall be made by the Parliament of</HI> Great-Britain, <HI>and without prejudice of other Rights of Justiciary.</HI></P>
<P><HI>That all other Courts presently in Being within the Kingdom of</HI> Scotland <HI>do remain, but subject to Alterations by the Parliament of</HI> Great-Britain; <HI>And that all Inferior Courts within the said Limits do remain Subordinat, as they now are, to the Supreme Courts of Justice within the same, in all time coming.</HI></P>
<P>Now it was thought most Irrational to argue, That the Laws and Constitution of Justice in <HI>Scotland</HI> was in this Treaty, gi∣ven up to the <HI>English;</HI> When as, by these Articles, the Courts of Justice, and the General Form of Administration, such as the Session, Justiciary, and all other Courts, were to remain in Force for ever, or in all time coming:</P>
<P>And yet, as if this had not been enough to secure the <HI>Scots</HI> from this Fear, the Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> Form the Ne∣gative, and in it enter on the Particulars, <HI>viz. That no Causes in the Kingdom of</HI> Scotland <HI>be Cognoscible by the Courts of Chancery, Queens Bench, Common Pleas, or any other Courts in</HI> Westminster <HI>Hall, and that the said Courts, or any other of the like Nature, af∣ter the Ʋnion, shall have no Power to Cognosce, Review, or Alter the Acts or Sentences of the Judicatures within</HI> Scotland, <HI>or stop the Execution of the same.</HI></P>
<P>The Privy Council indeed was left to the Queen to Dissolve or Continue, as Her Majesty might see Cause—; But that was by the Treaty subject to Parliamentary Determination, and how the Queen referr'd it to the Parliament, will appear in its Course.</P>
<P>Nay the Treaters were so tender of this General Invading the Particulars, That they took Care to Exempt Private Jurisdicti∣ons and Properties from the Power or Cognizance of Parliament, which is what is not done in <HI>England,</HI> and which, it has been thought even in <HI>Scotland</HI> too, had been better left to the Parlia∣ment in time, to have Dissolved, giving Satisfaction to the Par∣ties concerned, <HI>I mean,</HI> such as Heretable Offices, Jurisdictions for Life, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>All these Provisions were so exactly stated, and so forcible in themselves, and the <HI>Scots</HI> Commissioners had so shown both their Capacity in the Affairs of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and their Candor in respect to Union, in the Great Affair before them, That the <HI>English</HI> Commissioners made no Objection, but agreed to it, as they, the <HI>Scots</HI> Commissioners had brought it in, without any Amendment.</P>
<P>And this Formed the 18, 19, 20, 21 Articles of the Uni∣on, which were so clearly digested, that they admitted little or no Debate afterwards in the Parliament of <HI>Scotland,</HI> where
<PB N="60" REF="155"/>
all the rest past the strictest Scrutiny, and almost a Fiery Trial.</P>

<P>The Lord Treasurer, in Name of the Lords Commissioners for <HI>England,</HI> deliver'd to the Board the following Answer to the Propo∣sal offered by the Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> the 21<HI>st</HI> of <HI>May</HI> past, which was Read.</P>
<P>The Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> having taken into Conside∣ration the Proposals deliver'd in to them the 21<HI>st</HI> day of <HI>May</HI> last by the Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland,</HI> for the effectual prevent∣ing the Exportation of <HI>Scots</HI> Salt to <HI>England</HI> or the Plantations, without paying the same Excises with which <HI>English</HI> Salt is charged, during the Exemption allowed to <HI>Scotland</HI> from the said Duty, do give the following Answer to the several Proposals therein.</P>
<P N="1">1. As to the First Article of the said Proposal, <HI>viz.</HI> That no Salt be Transported from <HI>Scotland</HI> to <HI>England</HI> by Land under the Penalty of Forfeiting the Salt, and the Horses used in Transporting it, and paying ten shillings for every Bushel of Salt so Transported, for which the Carriers, as well as the Owner shall be lyable conjunctly and se∣verally, and the Carrier be Imprisoned until the said Penalty be paid.</P>
<P>The Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> do agree to the same with the Alterations following, <HI>viz.</HI> That no Salt be Transported from <HI>Scotland</HI> to <HI>England</HI> by Land in any manner whatsoever, under the Penalty of Forfeiting the Salt, and the Cattle and Carriages made
<PB N="61" REF="156"/>
use of in Transporting it, and paying 20 shillings for every Bushel of such Salt, and proportionable for a greater or lesser Quantity, for which the Carrier, as well as the Owner shall be lyable conjunctly and severally, and the Persons carrying the same, to be Imprisoned by any one Justice of the Peace by the space of six Months, without Baill or Main-prize, and until the Penalty be paid.</P>
<P N="2">2. As to the second Article relating to Salt Water-born, to be carried from Port to Port in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and Salt Exported from <HI>Scot∣land</HI> to <HI>England</HI> or the Plantations.</P>
<P>The Lords Commissioners for <HI>England,</HI> as to that part of it which relates to Salt Water-born to be carried from Port to Port in <HI>Scot∣land,</HI> do agree to the same.</P>
<P>And as to that part of the said Proposal which relates to Salt Ex∣ported from <HI>Scotland</HI> to <HI>England</HI> by Sea; The Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> do Propose, That there shall be paid in <HI>England,</HI> for all Salt made in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and Imported from thence into <HI>England,</HI> the same Duty upon the Importation as shall be paid for Salt made in <HI>England,</HI> to be levied and secured in the same manner as the Duties on Forreign Salt, are to be levied and secured in <HI>England,</HI> and if any other Salt which is not made in <HI>Scotland,</HI> shall be Im∣ported from thence into <HI>England,</HI> the same to be charg'd with the Duties on Forreign Salt Imported into <HI>England</HI> to be levied and se∣cured in the same manner.</P>
<P>And as to the last part of the said Article relating to Salt Expor∣ted from <HI>Scotland</HI> to the Plantations.</P>
<P>The Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> do not insist that any Duty ought to be paid for the same, or for Salt Exported from <HI>Scotland</HI> to any other Forreign Place whatsoever, in regard, that upon the Exportation of Salt from <HI>England</HI> to the Plantations, or any other Forreign Parts, the Duty before paid for the same, is to be Re∣paid.</P>
<P N="3">3. And as to that part of the last Article of the said Proposal, which relates to salted Fish Exported from <HI>Scotland</HI> into <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> do propose, That for all such Fish, there shall be paid in <HI>England</HI> upon the Importation there∣of, such Sums of Money as by the Law relating to the Duties upon Salt in <HI>England</HI> are allowed, and Re-paid to the Exporter thereof upon Exportation of the like Fish from <HI>England</HI> to Forreign Parts, in regard all Salt used in Fish Cured and Consum'd in <HI>England,</HI> is lyable to Duties of the same value, and in case the said Fish shall be Re-exported from <HI>England,</HI> the Duties paid for the same, upon Im∣portation thereof, shall be Re-paid.</P>
<P>And as to all salted Fish Exported from <HI>Scotland</HI> to any other place; The Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> do not insist that any Duty shall be paid in <HI>Scotland</HI> for the Salt used therein, in Regard upon the Exportation of such Fish from <HI>England</HI> to any Forreign Parts, the Exporter thereof hath an Allowance out of the Duties on Salt of so much Money as the Duty of the Salt used in Curing such Fish amounts to.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="157"/>
And as to that part of the said Article which Relates to salted Flesh Exported from <HI>Scotland,</HI> in Regard all salted Flesh consum'd in <HI>England</HI> or made use of for Victualling of Ships there, or Expor∣ted from <HI>England</HI> to parts beyond the Seas, is Cured with Salt, for which the Duty on Salt is paid in <HI>England,</HI> and not Re-paid upon Exportation of any such Flesh from <HI>England,</HI> and there being so much Salt used in the Curing one Hundred Weight of Flesh (each Hundred Weight being computed at one Hundred and Twelve Pound weight) as the Duty thereof payable in <HI>England,</HI> amounts to Two shillings.</P>
<P>The Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> do propose, That there be paid in <HI>England,</HI> upon the Importation of every such Hun∣dred Weight of Flesh from <HI>Scotland,</HI> two shillings; And that, be∣fore such Flesh is so Exported from <HI>Scotland,</HI> an Entry be made at the Custom-House of the Port of Exportation in <HI>Scotland,</HI> of the Quantity of Flesh so to be Exported, and the Port in <HI>England,</HI> for which the same is bound, and Security given by Bond to Her Ma∣jesty, at the said Port of Exportation in <HI>Scotland,</HI> That the said Flesh shall be Landed at the Port in <HI>England,</HI> for which the same shall be so Enter'd, or at some other Port in <HI>England,</HI> the Danger of the Seas and Enemies excepted: Which Bond shall be delivered up, upon producing a Certificate from the Collectors, or Officers of the Customs of the Port of Importation in <HI>England,</HI> That such Flesh was Landed, and left at the said Port; And that the Duty of two shillings be paid in <HI>Scotland,</HI> for all salted Flesh made use of for Victualling of Ships there, or Exported from thence to any other parts besides <HI>England;</HI> And that no salted Flesh be brought into <HI>England</HI> from <HI>Scotland</HI> by Land, under the penalty of Forfeiting the same, or the Value thereof, and the Cattle and Carriages imploy'd in carrying thereof, and of the like Imprisonment as they have be∣fore propos'd, in case of Salt brought from <HI>Scotland</HI> to <HI>England</HI> by Land.</P>
<P>And if any Frauds shall hereafter appear, which are not suffici∣ently provided against by the foregoing Proposals; The Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> do propose, the same shall be subject to such further Provisions, as shall be thought fit by the Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain.</HI></P>
<P>And whereas the Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> did, in their Paper delivered the 15 <HI>May</HI> last past, Consent, That the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland</HI> should, for a competent time, remain exempted from payment of the Duty on Salt, for all the Salt spent in Kind, or us'd in Provisions spent within that Kingdom: The Lords Commissio∣ners for <HI>England</HI> do now propose, That the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland</HI> shall remain exempt from payment of that Duty for all Salt spent in Kind, or used in Provisions within the said Kingdom, for the Term of seven Years after the Union, upon the Lords Commissio∣ners for <HI>Scotlands</HI> agreeing to the Proposals above-mentioned.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="158"/>
The Lord Treasurer, in Name of the Lords Commissioners for <HI>England,</HI> also delivered to the Board the following Proposal, which was Read.</P>
<P>That all Admiralty Jurisdiction be under the Lord High Admiral of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> or Commissioners for the Admiralty of <HI>Great-Bri∣tain</HI> for the time being; And that Appeals from the High Court of Admiralty of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> be to the Queen, in the same manner as is now settled in <HI>England.</HI></P>

<P>The Lord Chancellor, in Name of the Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland,</HI> deliver'd to the Board the following Paper, which was Read.</P>
<P>The Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> do agreee to the Proposal contain'd in the Answer delivered by the Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> the 5 Instant, concerning the effectual preventing the Ex∣portation of <HI>Scots</HI> Salt from <HI>Scotland</HI> to <HI>England,</HI> without paying the same Excises with which the <HI>English</HI> Salt is charg'd, during the Exemption allowed to <HI>Scotland</HI> from the said Duty, with the fol∣lowing Alterations.</P>
<P N="1">1. As to that part of the second Article, <HI>viz.</HI> That if any Salt which is not made in <HI>Scotland</HI> shall be Imported to <HI>England</HI> from thence, the same to be charg'd with the Duties of Forreign Salt Im∣ported into <HI>England,</HI> to be levied and secured in the same manner: The Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> do understand, That it is not the Meaning of the Lords Commissioners for <HI>England,</HI> by the said Proposal, to lay a double Duty on Forreign Salt, Exported from <HI>Scotland</HI> to <HI>England,</HI> once to be exacted at Importation of the said Salt into <HI>Scotland,</HI> and the like Duty at the Importation into <HI>Eng∣land</HI> from <HI>Scotland,</HI> but that the Forreign Salt Imported into <HI>Scot∣land,</HI> be charg'd at the Importation there, with the same Duties after the UNION, as the like Salt is charg'd with, being Imported into <HI>England,</HI> to be levied and secured in the same manner; And for further security in that case, The Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> do propose, that Certificates be sent with Forreign Salt, Ex∣ported from <HI>Scotland</HI> into <HI>England,</HI> from the Custom-Office in <HI>Scot∣land,</HI> where the said Forreign Salt was first Imported, to the Cu∣stom Office in <HI>England,</HI> where the said Salt shall happen to be Trans∣ported, bearing the payment of, or security given for the Duties at the said Port, under this Penalty, that Forreign Salt Exported from <HI>Scotland</HI> into <HI>England</HI> without such Certificates, shall be con∣fiscated.</P>
<P N="2">2. As to the Third Article relating to Salted Fish or Flesh, Ex∣ported from <HI>Scotland</HI> into <HI>England,</HI> and Salted Flesh made use of for Victualling of Ships in <HI>Scotland,</HI> or Exported from <HI>Scotland,</HI> to parts beyond the Seas; The Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> do apprehend, that the said Articles do only
<PB N="64" REF="159"/>
concern such Fish and Flesh as is cured in whole or in part with <HI>Scots</HI> Salt, there being an obvious Difference betwixt the Case of these, and of such Fish and Flesh, Exported from <HI>Scotland</HI> to <HI>England,</HI> as is wholly cur'd with Forreign Salt, in regard that Forreign Salt is to pay the like Duty as in <HI>England</HI> at Importation into <HI>Scotland,</HI> and therefore ought not to pay a second Duty.</P>
<P>And the Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> do propose, That if the Duty on Salt take place in <HI>Scotland,</HI> after the Expiration of se∣ven Years, during which time the Exemption is agreed to, That then the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland</HI> shall have an Equivalent.</P>
<P>The Lord Keeper, in Name of the Lords Commissioners for <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> deliver'd to the Board the following Proposal, which was Read.</P>
<P>The Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> being extremely desirous to come to a speedy Conclusion of the present Treaty, for an UNION of the two Kingdoms, and it having been already agreed, That the United Kingdom be Represented by one and the same Parlia∣ment; Their Lordships have turn'd their Thoughts to consider what may be a proper and reasonable Number for the Representa∣tive of <HI>Scotland</HI> in the House of Commons of the United Parlia∣ment; And dopropose to the Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland,</HI> That Thirty Eight Persons be the Number, by which that Part of the United Kingdom now called <HI>Scotland,</HI> shall be Represented in the House of Commons, when ever a Parliament shall be called in <HI>Great-Britain.</HI></P>

<P>The Lord Chancellor, in Name of the Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland,</HI> deliver'd to the Board the following Answer to the Pro∣posal made by the Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> on the 5th In∣stant, which was Read.</P>
<P>The Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland,</HI> in Answer to the Propo∣sal deliver'd by the Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> on the 5th In∣stant, concerning the Admiralty, do agree that all Admiralty Ju∣risdiction, be under the Lord High Admiral of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> or Commissioners of Admiralty of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> for the time being, and as to that part of the said Proposal, which concerns Appeals from the High Court of Admiralty, The Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> do propose.</P>
<P>That the Court of Admiralty now establish'd in <HI>Scotland</HI> be con∣tinued, and that all Reviews, Reductions or Suspensions of their Sentences in Maritime Cases, competent to their Jurisdiction, remain in the same manner after the Union, as now in <HI>Scotland,</HI> until the Parliament of <HI>Great Britain</HI> shall make such Regulations and Altera∣tions as shall be judged expedient for the whole united Kingdom, providing there be always continued in <HI>Scotland</HI> a Court of Admi∣ralty, such as is in <HI>England,</HI> for Determination of all Maritime Cases

relating to private Right in <HI>Scotland,</HI> competent to the Jurisdiction of the Admiralty Court.</P>
<P>And the Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> do further Propose, That the Heretable Rights of Admiralty and Vice Admiralties be reserv'd to the Respective Proprietors, as Rights of Property.</P>
<P>The Lord Chancellor did also, in Name of the Lords Commissio∣ners for <HI>Scotland,</HI> deliver to the Board the following Paper, which was Read.</P>
<P>The Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> having considered the Pro∣posal made by the Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> the 7th Instant, <HI>viz.</HI> That Thirty Eight Persons be the Number, by which that part of the United Kingdom, now call'd <HI>Scotland,</HI> shall be Repre∣sented in the House of Commons, when ever a Parliament shall be called in <HI>Great-Britain;</HI> Do find such Difficulties in that Matter, that they are under a Necessity to propose a Conference betwixt the Lords Commissioners for both Kingdoms on that Subject, in which their Lordships doubt not, but to Satisfie the Lords Commissioners for <HI>England,</HI> That a greater Number than is mentioned in the said Proposal will be necessary, for attaining the Happy UNION of the two Kingdoms, so much desired on both sides, and the Lords Com∣missioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> are willing now to enter on the said Conference, or when the Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> will please to appoint.</P>

<P>The Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> having considered the Pro∣posal delivered by the Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> on the 7<HI>th</HI> Instant, with the Conference that followed on the Subject of that Proposal; Their Lordships are hopeful, that the Lords Commissio∣ners for <HI>England</HI> are convinced of the real Difficulties occurring in

that Matter on the part of <HI>Scotland;</HI> And the Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> do find themselves still under an absolute Necessity, for bringing to a Happy Conclusion the UNION of the two Kingdoms, to insist, that a greater Number than that of Thirty Eight be agreed to, as the Representative for <HI>Scotland</HI> in the House of Commons in a Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain.</HI></P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATION IX.</HEAD>
<P>There were some Debates and a little time spent about the Matter of the Admiralty, but it was soon adjusted, and needs no Remark on it; only as to the Matter of Appeals to <HI>England,</HI> which however were found necessary, and agreed to with some little Trouble.</P>
<P>But here had like to have happened a Difficulty about Ap∣peals in Causes of private Right in <HI>Scotland</HI>—; Before the Union, Appeals in Law lay from the Lords of the Session to the Parliament; and the House of Peers of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> being now to be the Sovereign Judicature of <HI>Britain,</HI> there could be no Ap∣peals but to them in Parliament: This it was thought would be a Grievance, by Reason of the Distance of Place, the Expence of Travelling, and the Charge of Prosecuting those Tryals at the Bar of the House of Peers.</P>
<P>It was Objected, That the <HI>Scots</HI> Peers could not be allow'd to Vote in Matters of Judicature, either in Civil or Criminal Cases in <HI>England;</HI> and they gave a seeming substantial Reason for it, <HI>viz.</HI> That the <HI>Scots</HI> reserving their Judicature, Session and Justiciary to themselves, in which the <HI>English</HI> have no Voice, it would be unreasonable to desire the <HI>Scots</HI> should be let into that in <HI>England,</HI> which is reserv'd from the <HI>English</HI> in <HI>Scot∣land.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="162"/>
But to this it was Answered,<Q>The Lords in <HI>England,</HI> as Peers Assembled in Parliament, as they were before the Sovereign Judicature of <HI>England,</HI> would after the Union be together with the sixteen <HI>Scots</HI> Peers, the only Sovereign Judicature of <HI>Britain,</HI> and have their Voices in the Judicature of <HI>Scotland,</HI> as well as of <HI>England</HI>—; If this be made out, then the Objection against the <HI>Scots</HI> Noblemen Voting in Judicial Matters in <HI>England,</HI> would by Consequence fall to the Ground.</Q></P>
<P>The Judicature of the Lords consists in their trying their own Members for Life, and in Determining the Proceedings of all the other Courts of Justice in the Nation; an Appeal going to them from all other Judicatures whatsoever, whether before or after Judgment.</P>
<P>In Tryals of Peers, 'tis plain by this Union, the <HI>English</HI> Lords will have a Vote in the <HI>Scots</HI> Judicature, since they will have the Power to try all the <HI>Scots</HI> Peers for their Lives or other∣wise, in any Case wherein they shall become Obnoxious to the Law.</P>
<P>And as to Appeals, it was therefore absolutely necessary they should ly before the House of Lords, they being the only Supreme Judicature; and to have had Appeals before any other, had been to have two Supremes, unless Commissioned by them; And if Commissioned by them and made certain, they had been too Infe∣riour, and also not to be depended upon in Matters of such Mo∣ment. To solve this Difficulty, a short Scheme was handed about for the Regulating that Point, so as to Vest the whole Authority of the Law judicially in the <HI>British</HI> Peers in Parliament, and settle the Essential Part in them, without nevertheless imposing the Trouble upon the <HI>Scots</HI> of coming up with their Causes to the Lords Bar, which would be intolerable.</P>
<P><HI>The Scheme was as follows.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Scots</HI> have now an Appeal from the Lords of Session, which are their Judges of Assize, or whatever else they may call them.</P>
<P>This Right of Appeal must not dy tho' the Parliament be∣fore whom it lyes is Dissolved, but must Devolve upon that Power to which as the Center of the whole their Parliament De∣volves, <HI>viz. The Parliament of Britain;</HI> Otherwise should the Right of Appeal dy, which is one Article of the <HI>Scots</HI> Claim of Right, they endanger their Property, and may upon a Thou∣sand not unlikely Circumstances Revert to Tyrrannick Power, and even a Parliament may not help them.</P>
<P>The Right of Appeal being not Dissolv'd, but Transfer'd to the general Center of Power, where, or on which Branch of that Power must it reside? Not in the Commons, that would be to make them a Court of Judicature, which they to not pretend to, and can not by their Constitution accept.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="163"/>
Not to the select Number of <HI>Scots</HI> Representatives, that would be to give them more power than the <HI>English</HI> Representatives; one having a judicial Authority, the other not.</P>
<P>Not to a Number chosen by the <HI>Scots,</HI> that would be a new Creation, and be a Reserve of some Power superior even to the general supreme power of Parliament, and many ways give Umbrage of a possibility of Return to a separate Constitution, which would be really inconsistent with a National Incorporated Union, and capable of keeping on foot continual Jealousies, Complaints, and Discontents among us, and might sometime or other break out into a Rupture again, and Unravel the very Union it self.</P>
<P>To regulate this, we must fly to one general Maxime, which we must adhere clossly to in all Matters of this Dispute, <HI>viz.</HI> That the great Center of Power whether Civil or Criminal is, and is to be lodg'd in the Parliament then to be called, <HI>The Parliament of</HI> Great-Britain.</P>
<P>The Judicial Power in <HI>Scotland</HI> is immediately in the Session, as it is in <HI>England</HI> in the Judges; the Lords of the Session in <HI>Scotland</HI> as the Judges in <HI>England,</HI> receive their Commissions from the Sovereign, and in Her Name, and by Her Authority, tho' by special Law obtained in both Kingdoms, they are so fixed as that they can not be turn'd out but upon Misbehaviour.</P>
<P>From the Session in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and all Acts, Sentences or Decreets there, lyes an Appeal to the Parliament, who sitting in one House are the sovereign Judicature of the Nation, as well Commons as Lords; From the Judges in <HI>England</HI> Appeals ly to the Chancery, and from thence to the House of Lords as the supreme Judicature of this Nation.</P>
<P>But both Parliaments being to be Incorporated into one as both Nations by consequence will be one, so the publick Justice must run in the same Channel, and the Appeals of both Kingdoms ly before the <HI>British</HI> Peers only, as that sovereign Ocean of Justice into which all the Streams must flow.</P>
<P>But to the end that <HI>Scotland</HI> may, as far as may be, Eas'd in that Inconveniency, which her distance from the Capital may bring upon Her, &amp; in which she suffers otherways deeply enough, Appeals from the Courts of Justice in <HI>Scotland,</HI> may be tryed in <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>A Court of Appeals may be Erected in <HI>Scotland,</HI> delegated from the Peers of <HI>Britain</HI> assembled in Parliament, to be named Annually or Triennially, or every Session, or otherwise, as in the Treaty of Union shall be agreed.</P>
<P>These Delegates to be Nam'd out of the <HI>Scots</HI> Nobility and Gentry, to be chosen by Ballot, or by the usual way of Voting in the House of Peers.</P>
<P>That they should be <HI>Scots</HI> is but equal, as they are only to Judge of Causes in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and is agreeable to the Constitu∣tion of <HI>England,</HI> which causes all Tryals at Law to be tryed in
<PB N="69" REF="164"/>
the County where the Party dwells, and to be Determined by a Jury of the Freeholders or Inhabitants of that particular County, and of no other.</P>
<P>And yet this does no way lessen the Authority of the Parlia∣ment, but preserves the Title of the Lords here to a Voice even in the Supreme Judicature of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>This Scheme as it Entitules the Parliament of United <HI>Britain</HI> to its full and compleat Jurisdiction; so it preserves the Right of Appeal to the <HI>Scots,</HI> prevents the Expensive proceeding of carrying their Appeals to <HI>England,</HI> and takes away all the Force of the Objection against the <HI>Scots</HI> Noblemen having a Voice in the <HI>English</HI> Judicature.</P>
<P>Thus the Union in point of Judicature may still be compleat, and the general Incorporation not at all Obstructed, the Course of Justice left free and open, and both Nations equally concern'd in it.</P>
<P>The <HI>English</HI> Peers are let into the Sovereignty of the <HI>Scots</HI> Judicature as well as of their own; and the <HI>Scots</HI> let into all the necessary Privileges which the Right of their Peerage, and the nature of an Incorporated Equality requires.</P>
<P>There were Reasons to be given why this Proposal was not further entred upon, tho' both sides approved of the Method, some of which were perhaps such as these.<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That one side were willing enough to have all Appeals come to <HI>England.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Others willing to have as few as possible made at all, and supposing that the Inconveniencies of pursuing an Appeal to <HI>England,</HI> would incline People rather to acqui∣esce, and make the Judgment of the Session more De∣finitive—. But these things by the way.</ITEM>

<P>The Lord Keeper, in Name of the Lords Commissioners for <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> delivered to the Board the following Paper, which was Read.</P>
<P>The Lords Commissioners for <HI>England,</HI> having taken into Con∣sideration, the Reply delivered the 7th Instant, by the Lords Com∣missioners for <HI>Scotland,</HI> to the Answer of the Lords Commissioners for <HI>England,</HI> to the Proposal made by the Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> the 21st of <HI>May</HI> last, for the effectual preventing the Expor∣tation of <HI>Scotch</HI> Salt to <HI>England,</HI> or the Plantations, without paying
<PB N="70" REF="165"/>
the same Excises with which <HI>English</HI> Salt is charg'd, during the Ex∣emption allowed to <HI>Scotland</HI> from the said Dutys, and as to falted Provisions.</P>
<P>As to that part of the Reply which relates to the second Article in the said Answer, concerning Salt not made in <HI>Scotland,</HI> Impor∣ted from thence into <HI>England;</HI> The Lords Commissioners for <HI>Eng∣land</HI> did not intend, that a double Duty should be laid on Forreign Salt Exported from <HI>Scotland</HI> to <HI>England;</HI> and therefore the Lords Commissioners for <HI>England,</HI> do agree to the Proposal in the said Reply, that all Forreign Salt Imported into <HI>Scotland</HI> be charg'd at the Importation there with the same Dutys after the Union, as the like Salt is charg'd with, being Imported into <HI>England,</HI> to be levied and secured in the same manner, and to the further security, by Certificate therein propos'd, to be sent with Forreign Salt Expor∣ted from <HI>Scotland</HI> into <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>And as to that part of the said Reply, which relates to the third Article in the said Answer, touching salted Fish or Flesh Exported from <HI>Scotland</HI> into <HI>England,</HI> and salted Flesh made use of for Victual∣ling of Ships in <HI>Scotland,</HI> or Exported from <HI>Scotland</HI> to Parts be∣yond the Seas; It appearing by the said Proposal deliver'd by the Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> the 21st <HI>May</HI> last, That all Fish and Flesh Barrelled in <HI>Scotland</HI> for Exportation, are by the Law of <HI>Scotland</HI> appointed to be Pack'd and Cured with Forreign Salt, with∣out any mixture of <HI>Scotch</HI> Salt; The Lords Commissioners for <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> do not insist on the said third Article in their said Answer, Provid∣ed it be agreed, that all Salted Fish or Flesh Exported from <HI>Scotland</HI> to <HI>England,</HI> and all salted Flesh made use of for Victualling of Ships in <HI>Scotland,</HI> or put on Board to be Exported from <HI>Scotland</HI> to Parts beyond the Seas, that shall appear to be salted with <HI>Scots</HI> Salt, or a mixture of such Salt, shall be Forfeited, and as such may be seiz'd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n <HI>England</HI> or <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>As to the last part of the Proposal of the Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland,</HI> That if the Duty on Salt take place in <HI>Scotand</HI> after the expiration of seven years, that then the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland</HI> shall have an Equivalent; The Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> do understand, that the Equivalent is only to be extended to such part of the Duties as shall be applyed to the payment of the Debts of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The Lord Keeper did also, in Name of the Lords Commissio∣ners for <HI>England,</HI> deliver to the Board the following Proposal, which was Read.</P>
<P>The Lords Commissioners for <HI>England,</HI> being assured by the Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland,</HI> that there will be found insuperable Dif∣ficulties in reducing the Representation of <HI>Scotland</HI> in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom, to Thirty eight Members, the Number formerly propos'd by the Lords Commissioners for <HI>England;</HI> do, (to shew their Inclinations to remove every thing that would of necessity be an Obstruction to the perfecting the Union of the two Kingdoms) Propose to the Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland,</HI>
<PB N="71" REF="166"/>
That Fourty five Members, and no more be the Number of the Re∣presentatives for that Part of the United Kingdom, now called <HI>Scot∣land,</HI> in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom, after the intended Union.</P>
<P>And there being an absolute Necessity, that the Number of Peers to be admitted into the House of Lords of the United Kingdom, for that Part of the United Kingdom, now called <HI>Scotland,</HI> be re∣gulated in Proportion to the Number to be admitted into the House of Commons; do propose, that Sixteen Peers be the <HI>Quota</HI> of <HI>Scotland</HI> in the House of Peers of the Parliament of the United King∣dom, after the intended Union.</P>

<P>The Earl of <HI>Mar,</HI> in Name of the Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scot∣land,</HI> deliver'd to the Board the following Answer to the Proposal made by the Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> the 15th Instant, which was Read.</P>
<P>The Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> having considered the Paper delivered by the Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> the 15<HI>th</HI> Instant, containing a Proposal, that Fourty Five Members be the Number of the Representatives of that part of the United Kingdom, now called <HI>Scotland,</HI> in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom, after the Intended Union; And, That Sixteen Peers be the <HI>Quota</HI> of <HI>Scotland</HI> in the House of Peers, in the Parliament of the said United Kingdom: And being most desirous to concur in what is further Necessary to finish this Treaty, and at the same time sensible of the Difficulties on the part of the Lords Commissioners for <HI>Eng∣land</HI> in that Matter; Do not insist for greater Numbers (by vir∣tue of this Treaty) of Representatives in the House of Peers and the House of Commons, in the Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> than these propos'd by the Lords Commissioners for <HI>Eng∣land;</HI> Providing that all the Peers of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and their Successors to their Honours and Dignities, be, from and after the Union, Reckon'd and Declar'd Peers of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and that they Enjoy, in their Respective Degrees and Orders, all other Titles, Dignities, Preheminencies, Immunities and Priviledges whatsoever, as fully and freely as the Peers of <HI>England</HI> do at present, or the Peers of <HI>Britain</HI> may Enjoy hereafter.</P>
<P>And the Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> do further Propose, That the Peers of <HI>Scotland</HI> for that time being, and their Successors, do, at and after the Union, according to their different Degrees and Orders, Enjoy the Rank and Precedency of all Peers to be thereafter Created of the like Orders and Degrees in the said United Kingdom.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATION X.</HEAD>
<P>There was now the only remaining Difficulty of the Union before them, and this was the Consequence of the Third Article, <HI>viz.</HI> The Uniting the Parliament, and how to state the Propor∣tion of the Representative was the present Case.</P>
<P>The Difficulty was double, not only how to draw the Proportion so, as might consist with the Equalities spoken of before, which were the Foot or Rule of the Treaty, but how to draw it so, as that either Parliament, who were to Confirm this Work, should be rationally supposed to come into it.</P>
<P>Abundance of Schemes were proposed for this, as Mens Fan∣cies guided them, and the Debates without Doors were much warmer, than those within; However, as it was a Thing re∣quired particular Application, so it was the best Step that could have been taken, by way of preliminary, to propose a Confe∣rence, wherein both sides had full Scope to deliver their Argu∣ments and Reasons in the Case; since, to have gone on by Proposals and Answers in Writing, would have taken up more time than was needful to be spent in such an Affair, and have kept it depending; whereas both sides were pleased with the Hopes, and both the Kingdoms big with Expectation of the Success of this Treaty, and the Conclusion of the long expected Union.</P>
<P>There was no Occasion to look far back into former Years for Help in this Calculation; There was but one Precedent in the whole World, from which any Scheme could be drawn, and that was in the transient Union made by <HI>Oliver Cromwel;</HI> in which, as I have noted before, he brought every thing by a Scale of Proportions to a Point, as things then stood.</P>
<P>This Model of a Representative was taken from the Scheme of Proportions, upon which he had formed his Taxation, in which <HI>Scotland</HI> being Rated at about a 13<HI>th</HI> part of the Land Tax, had also allowed her about a 13<HI>th</HI> part of the Representa∣tive, as follows;<LIST>
<ITEM><HI>England</HI> was Taxed at 70000 <HI>l. per Mensem,</HI> and was Re∣presented in Parliament by 400 Members.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Scotland</HI> was Tax'd at 6000 <HI>l. per Mensem,</HI> and was Re∣presented in Parliament by 30 Members.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Now abating a few Fractions, which, in dividing Persons, cannot be exactly observed, it is plain, 30 to 400 is very near what 6000 <HI>l.</HI> is to 70000 <HI>l.</HI> as follows;</P>
<P>13 times 30 is 390 Members, and 13 times 6000 <HI>l.</HI> is 78000 <HI>l.</HI> whereas one is 8000 <HI>l.</HI> over in the Money, so the other is 10 under in the Representative.</P>
<P>I will not say, this was the most equal Judgment that ever was made of this kind as to <HI>Scotland,</HI> but I may be allowed to say, that, with Respect to <HI>England,</HI> it was certainly the most
<PB N="73" REF="168"/>
equal Distribution of Elections that ever was, and much beyond our present Method; For, in this Scheme, the Disproportion of Numbers was taken away, and the Election of Members to Represent Ruin'd Heaps, Decayed Castles and Depopulated Towns, was let fall: But of this by the way.</P>
<P>The present Calculation was not very remote from this in Effect, tho' not built upon the same Foot; and it was very rational∣ly argued here, That the Proportion could not be taken barely from the Share of Taxes paid, which was the Scheme which most of the Politicians of that time pretended to go upon; but that the Proportion must be doubly calculated, which if it be Exa∣min'd, and were to be Applyed in <HI>Holland,</HI> and other parts of the World, must have been done.</P>
<P>For Instance the Share in Taxes.</P>
<P>And the Number of the People.</P>
<P>If, on one Hand, the Share of Taxes may be low, yet the Number of People great; or, on the other Hand, the Share of Taxes high, and the People few, the Extremes are to bear their Weight in the Proportion.</P>
<P><LIST>
<ITEM>Thus, tho' the <HI>Scots,</HI> by this Union, paid but 48000 <HI>l.</HI> for <HI>Scotland</HI> to 1997000 <HI>l. English,</HI> which was about 1/40 part, forty times 48000 <HI>l.</HI> being 1920000 <HI>l.</HI> to have argued from thence, That they should have but 13 Members, which, to the House of Commons, is 1/39 6/13 part of 513: This would appear ridiculous.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Again, if you take an Estimate of the People of both Na∣tions, we shall find <HI>Scotland</HI> Esteemed to contain Two Millions, and <HI>England,</HI> at the highest Calculation, under Six; and this brings <HI>Scotland</HI> to a Third Part of the Members, which would be Extravagant the other way, and oblige them to send 171 Members to the House.</ITEM>
<ITEM>But, if you set these Extremes against one another, it will appear, That a Tenth of the Representative Answer'd as nigh to an Equality, as such a Thing could well be reduced to; and on this Foot, the <HI>Scots</HI> Commissioners were sup∣posed to be near the Matter, when they desired 50 Members might be the Representative for <HI>Scotland.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>However this was, the <HI>English</HI> Commissioners having propos∣ed 38, <HI>as by the Minutes,</HI> a Conference was agreed to.</P>
<P>And here the Commissioners sincerely and candidly applyed themselves to one another, debating not only the Reasons and Proportions on either Hand, but the Temper and Circumstances of either Nation; so, if possible, to Accommodate themselves to both, and to consider not only what was equal, but also what was likely to take place in the Minds of the respective Parlia∣ments, which were to debate it after them; of which none knew the Difficulties better than themselves, neither were these things fit to have been the Subject of Minutes, which, in time, were to be supposed, would be made publick, and be canvass'd
<PB N="74" REF="169"/>
on either side by the most Critical Heads of Two Nations, and particularly by those in both the Nations, whose Study it would be to oppose and obstruct the Union.</P>
<P>And indeed, in this Prudence of the Commissioners, consist∣ed the best Prospect of bringing this Treaty to a Happy Con∣clusion.</P>
<P>The Conference was Happy in its Success, the <HI>English</HI> Com∣missioners were convinc'd by the Reasons given on the other side, they saw the Difficulties which the <HI>Scots</HI> Commissioners Re∣presented lay before them; and regarding the End of their Meeting, which was to contribute, as much as in them lay, to Unite the Two Kingdoms, they advanced their Number to 45, and gave their Reasons and Difficulties on the other Hand, po∣sitively determining the Point, that they could go no further; Upon which the <HI>Scots</HI> Commissioners, from the same Zeal for bringing the Treaty, which was now in so Happy a Forward∣ness, to a Conclusion, acquiesced.</P>
<P>As for the Number of the Peers, there was no Room to de∣bate, since the Number proposed, which was 16, was a full Pro∣portion to the other, &amp; had more of an Equality in it a great deal, than any other part of the Treaty; Especially considering, That se∣veral of the <HI>Scots</HI> Peers then were Peers of <HI>England,</HI> and hereaf∣ter might become Peers of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> by Creation.</P>
<P>And thus this great Difficulty was also happily got over, and now the Union began to shew it self, and People on every Hand began to Expect, it should be Compleated in a few Days.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATION XI.</HEAD>
<P>The Debates about the 16 Peers are so clear, and the Que∣stions and Answers in themselves so direct, That they require no Explanation; Nor was there any thing considerable pass'd upon those Heads, which is not express'd in the Minute.</P>
<P>The settling the different Privileges between the Sitting Peers for the Time being, and the other Peers, seem'd to be the main Difficulty, and was quickly Regulated.</P>
<P>I know it was alledged in <HI>Scotland,</HI> That the Privilege of Peerage being, by this Treaty, extended to the Nobility of <HI>Scot∣land,</HI> I mean, as to Protection of their Persons and Estates, was both a Dishonour and a Disadvantage to them; A Dishonour, as if they were stooping to accept of an Exemption from an Ho∣nest Discharge of their Debts, and a Disadvantage, since now, they being not lyable to Prosecutions for Debt, would obtain no Personal Credit, whatever their Occasions might be—; And that a private Gentlemans Bond would now be more Valuable than a Noblemans, since it could be Sued and made Heretable, whereby his Estate should become lyable, as well after his Death, as in his Lifetime, whereas a Noblemans Bond could no way be put in Suit.</P>
<P>However this was, there was no making a Distinction, at a time when a Treaty was Transacting, to bring all, if possible, to an Equality of Circumstances, unless the <HI>English</HI> Nobility, should have laid themselves and their Estates open, to the com∣mon Process of the Law, which had been Inconsistent with their Constitution, and much more with their Convenience.</P>
<P>I have not meddled with the frequent Proposals, Answers and Replyes about the Salt Tax, as a Thing I shall speak more at large to, when I shall observe upon the Minutes of Parlia∣ment, where that Matter received a New Turn, and all these Scruples were effectually settled under one Head of Limitation, and so are needless to be Repeated here.</P>
<P>It may be needful to Explain something here, of the Debate and Restriction about Shipping; The <HI>English</HI> Commissioners had in their View the Act of Navigation, which, in <HI>England,</HI> obliges all the Ships Employed to and from <HI>England,</HI> except only such Ships as Import any Thing of the Growth or Manu∣facture of their own Country, to which those Ships belong, to be <HI>English</HI> built Ships, and the Mariners, or Sailers Navigating the same, to be Two Thirds, at least, Natural Born Subjects of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Now as <HI>Scotland</HI> of late Years wanting Timber, or other Ma∣terials for Building, had but very few Ships of their own Build∣ing, they carryed on the greatest part of their Forreign Trade in Ships built in <HI>Holland, Hamburgh,</HI> the <HI>Baltick,</HI> or other For∣reign Parts; Wherefore the <HI>English</HI> Commissioners, in order
<PB N="82" REF="177"/>
to set Bounds to the Introducing of Forreign Bottoms into our Trade as Free Ships, offered the Clause as in the Minute.</P>
<P>It was moved in the <HI>Scots</HI> Behalf, to give a certain time for the clearing up this Point, and that a Ship should be deemed Free at the time of the Union, if part of her was owned by <HI>Scots</HI> Men at the time of the Union, because as the <HI>Scots</HI> Traded much to <HI>Holland,</HI> so the Merchants of <HI>Amsterdam, Camphere, &amp;c.</HI> were in part Owners, in Company with the <HI>Scots</HI> Mer∣chants, of many of their Ships; And therefore it was thought hard, That if the Major Part of the Owners were <HI>Scots</HI> Men, yet the Ship should be deemed Forreign, which would either oblige the <HI>Scots</HI> Merchant to buy the Remainder, at what Price the Forreign Owner pleased to Exact, or oblige him to sell and cast off the Ship, which he could not carry on his Trade with∣out.</P>
<P>But as this would have clashed directly with the Act of Navi∣gation, and created innumerable Inconveniencies in Trade, it was left out; For then Forreigners had had no more to do, but to Interest <HI>Scots</HI> Men in a Moiety of their Ships, and so have made great Numbers of Forreign built Bottoms have pass'd for Free Ships in <HI>Britain,</HI> to an Inexpressible Damage of the <HI>English</HI> Trade.</P>
<P>This Point therefore being given up, it remained only to dispute the time, at which any Vessel belonging entirely to <HI>Scots</HI> Owners should be deemed Free; The <HI>English</HI> Commissioners put it, to be at the time of Signing the Treaty, the <HI>Scots</HI> Commissioners insisted on the time of the Commencement of the Union; But the Reasons given against that Latitude were so Convincing, that the <HI>Scots</HI> Commissioners Complyed with it.</P>
<P>The principal Reason was, That, in that Interval of time, the Merchants of either Kingdom might furnish themselves with great Numbers of Forreign Ships, which being built cheaper than the <HI>English,</HI> and becoming Free by this Clause, would be a great Prejudice to Trade; And seing it was the known Inte∣rest of both Kingdoms, to Encourage the Building of Merchants Ships among themselves, it could not but be the Interest of both, to prevent the Crowding in of Forreign Ships among them.</P>
<P>This was Debated again in the Parliament of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and, after long Discourses, obtain'd to pass with this small Alterati∣on, the Time <HI>of Ratifying,</HI> instead of the Time <HI>of Signing</HI> the Union, as shall appear in its place.</P>
<P>The Affairs of the Standards, Weights and Measures, were Things admitted no Debate in either Kingdom, so need no Ob∣servation; I shall give a Scale of the Differences hereafter, be∣cause it may be useful in Matters of Trade.</P>
<P>The Affair of the Coin made some Noise Abroad among the People, but the Answering the Loss of private Persons out of the Equivalent put a Stop to it, and it was also Adjusted with∣out any Hesitation.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="178"/>
Neither was there any Difficultie before them about the Affair of the Great-Seal of <HI>Britain,</HI> or of any Regulations with respect to a Seal in <HI>Scotland,</HI> for the passing such Acts, either relating to private Rights or publick Justice; but it appeared so equal, that it made no Difficulties, even at the time of the Parliament in <HI>Scotland,</HI> when most of the other Heads admitted such strong Debates.</P>
<P>But the next thing proceeded upon, was the Calculation of the Equivalent, which a Committee had been busy in settling, with Clerks appointed to Examine the Calculations, and State them for the Commissioners, the Result of which was now be∣fore them.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="minute">
<P>The Lord Treasurer in Name of the Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> deliver'd to the Board the following Proposal, which was Read.</P>
<P>The Lords Commissioners of the two Kingdoms having appointed a Committee consisting of a like Number of each Commission for adjusting the Equivalent to be allowed to <HI>Scotland</HI> for what that Kingdom should become lyable to answer towards payment of the Debts of <HI>England,</HI> by Reason of their having agreed to bear the same Duties of Customs and Excises upon all Exciseable Liquors; and the said Committee having frequently met, and after a full en∣quiry having agreed amongst themselves, and severally Reported to their respective Commissions, that the Sum of <HI>lib.</HI> 398085, 10 <HI>sh.</HI> was the Equivalent to be answered to <HI>Scotland,</HI> according to the proportion which the present Customs and Excises in <HI>Scotland</HI> do bear to the Customs and Excises upon Exciseable Liquors in <HI>England;</HI> and the Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> having considered and Examin'd the said Report, Do agree to the said Sum.</P>
<P>The Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> having also insisted, That after the Union the Kindgom of <HI>Scotland</HI> becoming lyable to the <HI>English</HI> Duties of Customs and Excises upon exciseable Liquors, as well upon that account as upon the account of the increase of Trade and People, which will be the happy consequence of the said Uni∣on, the said two Revenues will much improve, of which no present Valuation can be made; Yet nevertheless for the Reasons aforesaid there ought to be a proportionable Equivalent allowed to <HI>Scotland;</HI> The Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> do agree that after the Union there shall be an Accompt kept of the said Duties arising in <HI>Scotland,</HI> to the end it may appear what ought to be allowed to <HI>Scotland</HI> as a proportionable Equivalent for such proportion of the said Increase, according to the calculation aforesaid, as shall be applicable to the payment of the Debts of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> having also by their Paper delivered the 21<HI>st</HI> Instant, propos'd that the Rights and Priviledges of the Company in <HI>Scotland,</HI> Trading to <HI>Affrica</HI> and the <HI>Indies,</HI> do continue after the UNION, or if the Priviledges of that Company be judg'd inconvenient for the Trade of the United Kingdom, That
<PB N="84" REF="179"/>
the private Rights of the said Company in <HI>Scotland</HI> be purchas'd from the said Proprietors; The Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> in Answer thereto, say they are of opinion, That the continuance of that Company is inconsistent with the Good of Trade in the U∣nited Kingdom and consequently against the interest of <HI>Great-Britain;</HI> And therefore, they insist that it ought to be determined; But the Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> being sensible that the Mis∣fortunes of that Company have been the occasion of Mis-understand∣ings, and Unkindnesses between the two Kingdoms, and thinking it to be above all things desireable, that upon the Union of the Kingdoms, the Subjects of both may be entirely United in affection; Do therefore wish that regard may be had to the Expences and Losses of the particular Members of the said Company, in the man∣ner hereafter-mentioned, and they hope when the Lords Commis∣sioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> have considered how Generally that undertaking was enter'd upon in <HI>Scotland</HI> and consequently how universal that Loss was, they will readily agree to the Proposal.</P>
<P>The Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> do also think it of much con∣sequence to <HI>England,</HI> that it should be agreed in this Treaty after what manner the Equivalent (which will amount to a great Sum payable upon and after the Union) is to be paid and applyed, and being extremely desirous to bring the Treaty to a speedy Conclusion, and in order to that, as soon as may be, to settle and fix the mat∣ter of the Equivalent, and the Application thereof; Do agree as fol∣lows, and do also make the following Proposals to the Lords Com∣missioners for <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>The Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> do agree, That upon com∣pleating the Union, the said Sum of <HI>Lib.</HI> 398085 10 <HI>sh.</HI> being agreed upon as the Equivalent for <HI>Scotland,</HI> shall be granted to Her Majesty for that use.</P>
<P>The Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> do also agree, that upon the Account to be kept as aforesaid of the Improvement of the Re∣venue of Customs and Excises upon Exciseable Liquors in <HI>Scotland</HI> after the Union, there shall be answered to <HI>Scotland</HI> an Equivalent in proportion to such part of the said increase as shall be applicable to the payment of the Debts of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> do also agree, That an Equivalent shall be answered to <HI>Scotland</HI> for such other parts of the <HI>English</HI> Debts as that Kingdom may hereafter become lyable to pay by reason of the Union.</P>
<P>The Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> do propose for the further, and more effectual answering the several ends hereafter mention'd and propos'd, That from and after the Union, the whole increase of the Revenue of Customs and Excises upon Exciseable Liquors in <HI>Scot∣land,</HI> over and above what the said Revenues do now yeeld, shall go and be applyed for the Term of seven years, to the uses hereafter mentioned.</P>
<P>And upon the said Agreements and Proposal, The Lords Com∣missioners for <HI>England</HI> do further propose, That Her Majesty be Im∣powr'd
<PB N="85" REF="180"/>
to appoint Commissioners, who shall be accomptable to the Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> for disposing the said Sum of 398085 <HI>Lib.</HI> 10. to be granted as af resaid, and also of all other Moneys which shall arise upon the Agreements and Proposal aforesaid to the purposes following, 1. That out of the said Sum of 398085 <HI>Lib.</HI> 10. all the publick Debts of the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and also the Capital Stock or Fund of the <HI>African</HI> and <HI>Indian</HI> Company of <HI>Scot∣land</HI> together with the interest for the said Capital Stock, after the rate of 5 <HI>p.</HI> cent. <HI>p. Annum</HI> from the respective times of payment thereof shall be payed, and that immediately upon such payment of the said Capital Stock and Interest, the said Company shall be Dissolved and shall cease; Provided nevertheless that from the time of passing the Act, for raising the said Summe of 398085 <HI>Lib.</HI> 10. The said Company shall neither Trade nor give licence to Trade.</P>
<P>The Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> do further propose, That after payment of the said publick Debts, and Refounding the said Capital Stock in manner aforesaid, the overplus of the said Sum of 39<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>085 <HI>Lib.</HI> 10 <HI>sh.</HI> And also the whole improvement of the Re∣venue of Customs and Excises upon Exciseable Liquors (above the present value) which shall arise during the Term of seven years, from the commencement of the Union as aforesaid, together with the Equivalent which shall become due upon account of the Im∣provement of the Customs and Excises on Liquors in <HI>Scotland,</HI> after the said seven years, and all other Sums, which according to the Agreement aforesaid may become payable to <HI>Scotland,</HI> by way of Equivalent, for what that Kingdom shall hereafter become lyable to answer for the Debts of <HI>England,</HI> may be applyed in the manner following.</P>
<P>That out of the same what consideration shall be found necessary to be had for any Losses which privat Persons may sustain in Re∣duceing the Coyn of <HI>Scotland,</HI> to the Standard of <HI>England</HI> (menti∣on whereof is made in another Paper delivered by the Lords Com∣missioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> the 21<HI>st</HI> Instant) may be made good, and afterwards the same shall be wholly Employed towards encouraging and promoting the Fisherys, and such other Manufacturys and Im∣provements in that part of <HI>Britain</HI> called <HI>Scotland,</HI> as may most conduce to the general Good of the United Kingdom.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATION XII.</HEAD>
<P>In making Observations on the Affair of the <HI>African</HI> Compa∣ny, it may be necessary to state that part of the <HI>African</HI> Affair, as belongs to this immediate Debate.</P>
<P>The <HI>African</HI> Company having, as has been related in the beginning of this Work, met with several Disasters and Mis∣fortunes, in some of which, the National Interests of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland,</HI> had but too much clashed, and which had been the Occasion of a great deal of ill Blood between them, it was
<PB N="86" REF="181"/>
absolutely necessary, in the bringing to pass an Union between the Kingdoms, to remove every Occasion of Discontent; and particularly every Interfereing Interest, being Inconsistent with a compleat entire Union, the Thing now aim'd at, there was therefore an absolute Necessity to Remove or Reconcile every Thing of that Nature, as far as possible, before such an Union could be made.</P>
<P>The <HI>Scots</HI> Commissioners were in the right to propose, That their <HI>African</HI> Company should be supported and defended as a private Right, all Rights and Privileges of Corporations and Companies being to be Reserved; And this having been a National Concern, in which they had but made an Essay, and miscarrying in their first Attempt, had let it rest for a while, but had Various Prospects of Future Projects and Attempts; It could not be equal, to oblige them to quit these Prospects, and their Legal Right to a Trade to the <HI>Indies,</HI> which was so Valuable in other Countries, and which might in Time Restore their Losses; and therefore they proposed the Reserving to themselves the Charters, Rights and Privileges of their <HI>African</HI> and <HI>Indian</HI> Company.</P>
<P>On the other Hand, the Case of <HI>England</HI> made this Impracti∣cable; For, whereas there was already a Company Establish∣ed in <HI>England,</HI> Formed, and, with great Difficulty United in∣to One, from two Contending and Powerful Companies; And that these were entirely supported, and depended upon their Exclusive Charters, by which no other Persons could Trade to the <HI>Indies</HI> but themselves, or, by their Permission: If this Company Established in <HI>Scotland</HI> had continued after the Union, the Article for a Free Intercourse of Trade between the Nations, had immediately open'd to them all the Ports of <HI>England,</HI> for their Ships and Goods; And it had been, in Event, a perfect laying open the <HI>East-India</HI> Trade, or at least Erecting a New <HI>East-India</HI> Company in <HI>Britain,</HI> which, whoever knows the Diffi∣culty of Uniting the last Contending Companies, and the Injury they did both their Trade in particular, and the whole Nation of <HI>England</HI> in general, before they could be brought together, will acknowledge, is not to be born within <HI>Britain.</HI></P>
<P>This the <HI>Scots</HI> Commissioners foresaw, and therefore very frankly proposed the Alternative, <HI>viz. That if the Priviledges of that Company shall be judg'd Inconvenient for the Trade of the Rest of the Ʋnited Kingdom, that the private Rights of the said Com∣pany in</HI> Scotland <HI>be purchas'd from the Proprietors.</HI></P>
<P>This was the least that could be demanded; For, if <HI>Eng∣land</HI> found it Impracticable to suffer, or Intolerable to their Two Companies to bear, it was but reasonable, that the Company, who was to quit its Right, should have Satisfaction for parting with that Right: And the next Question was there∣fore, what must this Purchase be, and who must pay it, and this was no small Point.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="182"/>
<HI>England</HI> was so clear and fair in all their Offers as to the Equivalent, That the <HI>Scots</HI> Commissioners were, in a manner, pre∣vented in every thing they had to ask; The Offers of a full Recom∣pence in Money, advanc'd for all the Money which <HI>Scotland</HI> should be charg'd to pay towards the <HI>English</HI> Debts, and of applying the whole remaining Revenue of <HI>Scotland</HI> for the Encouraging Trade, and Employing the Poor, had in it so much Evidence of the hearty Design of the <HI>English</HI> Commissioners, to consider every Thing for the Good of the Community after the Union, That it could bear but little Objection: It seem'd therefore but reasonable, That the <HI>Scots</HI> should, at their own Charge, put themselves in Condition of Uniting, <HI>That is,</HI> That, if they had any National Obstruction, which was Inconsistent with the design'd Union, and without Removing which it could not be made, that then the Removing that Difficulty should ly at their Door.</P>
<P>It was this kind of Reasoning, which directed the Purchase of the private Rights of the <HI>African</HI> Company in <HI>Scotland</HI> to be made out of the Equivalent Money; And to which, after very little Debate, as you may see, both Parties agreed.</P>
<P>Then the Question was, What Price should these private Rights be purchased at; And this would have met with great Difficulties, some magnifying the Prospects of their Company in Trade, as a Thing not to be Valued, and which alone was able to Enrich their Nation; Others lessening it in the most contemptible manner, as a Thing that not only had now, but never had any Prospect or Possibility of Success, as it had been managed. Of which by it self—.</P>
<P>But the Method proposed appeared so fair, That it left no Room for Objection, it being a Valuation from the True Origi∣nal, <HI>viz.</HI> That every private Adventurer should be put in the same Condition as he was in at first, supposing his Money put out to Interest—; So that every Man was to receive his full Original Capital Stock which he had at first advanced, and 5 <HI>per Cent.</HI> Interest to the Time of Payment.</P>
<P>Nor can I forbear saying, That the Surprize of this Offer had Various Effects upon the People; for this Stock was a dead Weight upon a great many Families, who wanted very much the Return of so much Money: It had not only been long dis∣burs'd, but it was, generally speaking, abandoned to Despair, and the Money given over for lost; Nay, so entirely had People given up all Hopes, That a Man might even, after this Con∣clusion of the Treaty, have bought the Stock at 10 Pound for an Hundred; And after all this, to find the whole Money should come in again with Interest for the Time, was a Happy Surprize to a great many Families, and took off the Edge of the Oppo∣sition, which some People would otherwise have made to the Union in general.</P>

<P>The Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> having considered the Proposal delivered by the Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> the 22<HI>d</HI> Instant, concerning the Great Seal; Their Lordships do agree, that there shall be a Great Seal for the United Kingdom of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> to be used for Sealing Writs, to Elect and Summon the Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and for Sealing all Treaties with Forreign Princes, and States, and all publick Writes and Orders of State which con∣cern the whole United Kingdom. And the Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> do propose, That the Great Seal of the United King∣dom be different from the Great Seals now Used in either Kingdom, and that the Quartering the Arms as may best suit the Union be left to Her Majesty, and that in the mean time the Great Seal of <HI>England</HI> be used as the Great Seal of the United Kingdom. And the Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> do further propose as a con∣sequence of the Reservations agreed to by the Lords Commissioners for both Kingdoms of the Laws and Customs in <HI>Scotland,</HI> That a Seal in <HI>Scotland</HI> after the Union, be always kept and made use of, in all things relating to private Rights or Grants, which have usual∣ly pass'd the Great Seal of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and which do only concern Offices, Grants, Commissions and private Rights within that King∣dom; and that the Privy Seal, Signet, Signet of the Justiciary Court, Quarter Seal, and other Seals of Courts now in use in <HI>Scot∣land</HI> be continued, but that the same be altered and adapted to the State of the Union as Her Majesty shall think fit, and that the said Seals, and all of them, and the Keepers of them shall be subject to such Regulations as the Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> shall hereafter make.</P>
<P>The Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> do also propose, That upon calling the first Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and until the said Parliament shall make further Provision therein, the following Method be used in summoning the Members from <HI>Scotland,</HI> to at∣tend in both Houses of Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain, viz.</HI> That a Writ under the Great Seal of the United Kingdom be issued out for summoning the said Members, and that the said Writ be directed to such Court, Officer or Office, and to be Executed and Return'd in such manner, as in the Parliament of <HI>Scotland</HI> shall be settled, at, or before Ratifying the Treaty.</P>
<P>The Lord Chancellor did also in Name of the Lords Commissio∣ners for <HI>Scotland,</HI> deliver to the Board the following Paper, which was Read.</P>
<P>The Paper deliver'd by the Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> on the 25<HI>th</HI> Instant, concerning the Equivalent, do's very much con∣tribute to the bringing this Treaty to a conclusion. And the Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> being ready to concur on their part, do agree to the same, with the following Additions and Explanati∣ons.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="90" REF="185"/>
I. And first, Where the said Commissioners for both Kingdoms have agreed that the Summe of 398085 <HI>l.</HI> 10 <HI>sh.</HI> is the Equivalent to be Answered to <HI>Scotland,</HI> according to the proportions, which the present Customs and Excise of <HI>Scotland</HI> do bear to the Customs and Excises upon Excisable Liquors in <HI>England;</HI> The Lords Commis∣sioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> do propose, That the Accompts and Calculati∣ons which lay before the Committee, by which it do's appear, from whence the foresaid Sum do's arise be enter'd in the Journal Books of this Treaty.</P>
<P>And where the Lords Commissioners for both Kingdoms have also agreed that an Account be kept of the Duties in <HI>Scotland,</HI> arising from the Customs and Excises upon Excisable Liquors, beyond the present Estimat, To the end, It may appear what ought to be al∣lowed to <HI>Scotland,</HI> as an Equivalent to such proportion of the said Encrease, according to the Calculation aforesaid, as shall be Ap∣plicable for payment of the Debts of <HI>England;</HI> The Lords Commis∣sioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> do in like manner propose, That the Calculation of that proportion which lay before the Committee be enter'd in the Books of Journal of this Treaty.</P>
<P>And where, the Lords Commissioners for both Kingdoms have agreed, That upon compleating the Union, the said Summe of 398085 <HI>l.</HI> 10 <HI>sh.</HI> being agreed upon as the Equivalent for <HI>Scotland,</HI> shall be granted to Her Majesty for that use: The Lords Commissio∣ners for <HI>Scotland</HI> do understand it to be the meaning of the Lords Commissioners for <HI>England,</HI> That the said Summe be Granted to Her Majesty in the Parliament of <HI>England,</HI> at or before Ratifying the Treaty, and do propose, that the Summe be due and payable from the time of Ratification of the Union in both Parliaments.</P>
<P>And whereas, It is agreed on both sides, That Her Majesty be Impowred to Appoint Commissioners who shall be Accomptable to the Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> for Disposing of the said Sum of 398085 <HI>lib.</HI> 10 <HI>sh.</HI> to be Granted as aforesaid, and also of all other Moneys that shall arise upon the Agreements and Proposal aforesaid, to the purposes mentioned in the said Paper delivered by the Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> on the 25<HI>th</HI> Instant; The Lords Com∣missioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> do propose that the foresaid Commissioners be not only Impowred to call for, Receive and Dispose of the foresaid Summe to the purposes mentioned in the said Paper; But further, that the said Commissioners be Authoriz'd and Impowred to Inspect the Books of the several Collectors of the said Revenues of Customs and Excise, and of all other Duties, from whence an Equivalent may arise, and that the Collectors and Mannagers of the said Duties and Revenues be oblig'd to give to the said Commissioners Subscrib'd Authentick Abbreviats of the produce of the several Revenues and Duties arising in their respective Districts on Account, where an Equi∣valent may become due to <HI>Scotland;</HI> which Commissioners shall be oblig'd to keep Books, containing Accompts of the Ammount of the Equivalent, and how the same shall be Disposed of from time to time; Which Books shall be Patent for Inspection to all the Subjects

in <HI>Scotland;</HI> And that the said Commissioners have their Office within the limits of the said Kingdom of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>

<P>The Earl of <HI>Pembroke</HI> President of the Council, in Name of the Lords Commissioners for <HI>England,</HI> delivered to the Board the fol∣lowing Paper, which was Read.</P>
<P>The Lords Commissioners who are on the part of <HI>England</HI> of the Committee of Lords of both Kingdoms, nominated the first of <HI>May</HI> last, to consider Matters to them referr'd, having Reported to us the Lords Commissioners for <HI>England,</HI> That the said Committee had referred to Six Persons the Stating, in what Proportion the pre∣sent Customs of <HI>Scotland</HI> as now lett, do bear to the several Branches of that Revenue in <HI>England,</HI> and also in what proportion the present Excise upon Liquors in <HI>Scotland,</HI> as now lett, do bear to the several Branches of that Revenue in <HI>England,</HI> in order to the
<PB N="95" REF="190"/>
stating of the Equivalent, that would become due to <HI>Scotland,</HI> for so much of the said two Revenues as should be apply'd towards the payment of the Debts of <HI>England,</HI> which was accordingly done as in N<SUP>o.</SUP> 1. And that the said Six Persons had also by their Lordships directions prepared a Calculation, what so much of the said two Re∣venues of <HI>Scotland,</HI> as should be applyed towards payment of the Debts of <HI>England,</HI> would produce of ready Money as in N<SUP>o</SUP> 2. The said six Persons had also calculated, that in case the said two Re∣venues should encrease (above what they are now Let for) 1000 <HI>Lib.</HI> on the Customs, and 1000 <HI>Lib.</HI> on the Excise, how much there∣of would contribute towards the payment of the Debts of <HI>England,</HI> and for which <HI>Scotland</HI> is to have an Equivalent, as in N<SUP>o.</SUP> 3. All which Papers their Lordships having now laid before us; We the Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> do agree to the same, and that all the said Papers be enter'd by the respective Secretarys in the Journals of this Treaty.</P>
<P>Adjourn'd to <HI>Tuesday</HI> the 9<HI>th</HI> Instant 5 in the Evening.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="13" TYPE="observation">
<HEAD>OBSERVATION XIII.</HEAD>
<P>I might make Observations here upon the manner of stating the Equivalent; for in a Matter of that Moment it is not to be doubted but there were various Judgments past, Projects found∣ed, and Proposals made on every side, for the bringing this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ifficult Thing to bear, in which every body spoke according to their several Judgments, and as I noted before, every Man supposed this such an insuperable Difficulty, that it would never have been mastered in the Treaty, and therefore various Schemes were made.</P>
<P>The main Difficulty, as I have hinted already, was the Proposal it self of an Equivalent, and indeed without this it had been impossible to bring this Union to a Conclusion; Nor was the way ever seen clear towards a Union till the project of an Equi∣valent was thought of; The Manner of it therefore might con∣sequently be supposed to introduce equal Difficulty, some pro∣posed it in an Annual payment of Interest to <HI>Scotland</HI> of <HI>lib.</HI> 30000 <HI>per Annum,</HI> or 600000 <HI>lib.</HI> in Money, to be stated at 5 <HI>lib. per Cent.</HI></P>
<P>But the People that made these Proposals, built upon the Supposition, of the <HI>Scots</HI> Revenues paying a far greater share of the <HI>English</HI> Debt, than upon a further search into the several Articles, appeared probable; and at best built upon imaginary Encreases on one side, and imaginary Expences on the other, as will appear by the following Schemes of the improved Taxes of <HI>Scotland</HI> after the Union.</P>

<P>I should not Record this Imaginary and Erroneous Scheme, but to illustrate and shew the Necessity and Original of the True; perhaps the Author of this Scheme had as near a View as any body at that time of Day could come at.</P>
<P>But when the Commissioners on both sides came to Form themselves into a Committee to state this so, as that neither Kingdom might object, they found themselves under a Necessity of keeping a <HI>Medium</HI> between two dangerous Extremes, That the <HI>Scots</HI> on one Hand might not plead a Disparity of Allow∣ance, and consequently deny its being an Equivalent, which would overthro' the Foundation; And the <HI>English</HI> might not complain they were wrong'd in the Calculation, and paid more for the Proportion than it was worth.</P>
<P>To bring this therefore to a Head, they went back to the Principles, which was an infallible Rule to Judge by, and taking the Customs and Excises of <HI>Scotland,</HI> which were the only Taxes which Could be appropriated to the payment of <HI>English</HI> Debts, and stating them at the present produce as they were then Farmed out, they advance to the <HI>Scots</HI> as much Money as the annual Produce of those Sums appropriated as above comes to—. This was capable of a most exact Calculation to the least Fraction, and was exactly cast up as in the Tables an∣nexed to the Minutes, which I have also Printed, that Posterity may see how exactly this Matter was carry'd between both, and may for ever be satisfied with the Justice which was done them in either Nation.</P>
<P>The Calculation being made exactly for the present Revenue of <HI>Scotland;</HI> It was not for the Commissioners to attempt a real Advance upon imaginary Encreases, which might or might not come to pass, as Trade might or might not be Enlarged by <HI>the Ʋnion.</HI> But to remove all possible Objections, they first State how much shall be appropriate to the payment of the <HI>English</HI> Debts, upon every Thousand Pound that any of the Revenues of <HI>Scotland</HI> shall thereafter advance, and then appointing an exact Account to be kept of such Advance; Agree, that <HI>Scotland</HI> shall be Re-imbursed by way of Equivalent, as much as shall be paid out of such advanced Revenues, and that Commissioners be
<PB N="97" REF="192"/>
appointed both to see the Calculations made and Accompts kept, and also to pay the said Equivalent as it becomes due.</P>
<P>This was so clear, so just, and so unexception'd a Method, that it could admit of no Dispute, and brought the most in∣tricate part of the whole Treaty to a happy conclusion.</P>
<P>The Question about the manner of payment was now all that remained, and the Proposal for an <HI>Annual</HI> Interest found no room; for this had been but the same thing with letting the Revenues of <HI>Scotland</HI> pay themselves as it came in; Nor could it enable <HI>Scotland</HI> to answer the Incumbrances which were then upon her, and which it behoved her to clear her self of to make way for the Union, such as the paying of, or purchasing the Capital Stock of the <HI>African</HI> Company, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> making good the deficien∣cy of the Coin, paying the publick Debts <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>To solve this, the Calculation being made, they proposed to Estimate the Value of the Proportions which <HI>Scotland</HI> would so pay of the <HI>English</HI> Debts, and reduce them to a Rate in pre∣sent Money, according to the common Estimates then current for advanced payment to the Government; and that then <HI>Eng∣land</HI> should pay the full Sum down in ready Money, the payment to become due upon the signing the Union.</P>
<P>This was thought not only Just, but Advantageous to <HI>Scot∣land,</HI> and indeed Necessary to her, to supply the Stagnation which might be upon the current Cash of that Kingdom on the Alteration of the Coyn, and to cause Money to circulate among them, which was then much wanted.</P>
<P>This part of the Calculation I have therefore caused to be Printed here as it stands in the Books of the Commissioners, to clear up the Particulars, and to convince the nicest Objectors with what Exactness and equal proportion every part of this Transaction was carried on.</P>

<P>The Affair of the <HI>African</HI> Company and the Equivalent being thus settled, there was nothing now before them, but things of small Moment, and easily adjusted, such as the Quartering of the Arms, Uniting the Crosses, and Settling the Banners, Ensigns and Trophies of the United Kingdoms, Regulating Weights and Measures, the Methods of Calling and Regulat∣ing the Parliament, and the Summoning the Members, and the like; In all which, the Commissioners on both sides had little

<P>The Lords Commissioners for both Kingdoms went from the <HI>Cock∣pit</HI> to Attend the Queen at St. <HI>James</HI>'s, where the Lord Keeper, in Name of the Lords Commissioners for <HI>England,</HI> made the following Speech, and presented to Her Majesty one of the Sign'd and Seal'd Instruments or Writings, containing the Articles of Union on the part of <HI>England.</HI><Q><P><HI>May it please Your Majesty,</HI></P><P>WE the Commissioners Appointed by Your Majesty, in pursu∣ance of the Act of Parliament pass'd in Your Kingdom of <HI>England,</HI> to Treat concerning an Union of the Two Kingdoms, with the Commissioners for <HI>Scotland,</HI> do (according to our Duty) Hum∣bly beg Leave to present to Your Majesty these the Effects of our Continued and Faithful Endeavours towards that End.</P>
<P>They are the Articles agreed upon between Your Commissioners of both Kingdoms, as the Terms or Conditions, upon which the intended Union is to take place, if Your Majesty, and the Parlia∣ments of both Kingdoms shall think fit to Approve and Confirm the same.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="198"/>
In these we have come to an Agreement on every point, we Judg'd Necessary to Effect a compleat and lasting Union, and we have En∣deavoured not to stir into any Matter we had Reason to think was not so.</P>
<P>And altho' we have Unanimously carried this Treaty thus far, purely from a Conviction, that we have done therein to GOD, Your Majesty, and our Countries Good Service; Yet we are far from thinking, that what we have done will or ought to be of any Weight or Authority elsewhere; but do most entirely submit these our Labours to the High Wisdom of Your Majesty, and both Your Parliaments, to stand or fall by the Reason, Justice, and publick Utility on which they are founded.</P>
<P>Your MAJESTIES Royal Presence and Seasonable Admoni∣tions to us at the fittest Junctures were (we most Thankfully Acknowledge) a very great Encouragement and Assistance to us in the Difficulties we met with.</P>
<P>Your Majesties Glory is already perfect, and the finishing this Work is all that is wanting to compleat as well as secure the Happiness of so great a People, as Your Subjects may now without any arrogance pretend to be.</P>
<P>May Your Majesty Live not only to give a Sanction of this Uni∣versal Blessing to all Your People, but also to see in a long and prosperous Reign over us the many Immediat (or near) Good Effects of it; But as for that great and main Consequence of it, for which Your Majesty is making by a most Gracious and Charitable Foresight, this only Effectual Provision, I mean the continuance of Peace and Tranquility in this Island, upon a descent of the Crown instead of that Blood shed and Distraction which would probably follow upon the fatal Division of it.</P>
<P>May we be so happy, as never in our days, to Experiment the fitness of these Measures your Majesty is now taking for that end? But may late, very late Posterity only in that respect reap the Ad∣vantage of them.</P></Q></P>
<P>The Lord Chancellor of <HI>Scotland</HI> in Name of the Lords Commis∣sioners for <HI>Scotland,</HI> made the following Speech, and presented to Her Majesty one of the Sign'd and Seal'd Instruments or Writings, containing the Articles of Union on the part of <HI>Scotland.</HI><Q><P><HI>May it please Your Majesty;</HI></P><P>THE Commissioners appointed by Your Majesty for the King∣dom of <HI>Scotland,</HI> to Treat of an Union of Your two King∣doms of <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>England,</HI> have Commanded me to re∣turn Your Majesty their most humble and dutyful Acknowledgments, for the Honour Your Majesty has Conferr'd on them, in Employing them to Negotiat this most important Affair, which is of the greatest Consequence to all Your Majesties Subjects.</P>
<P>We have endeavoured to discharge this Trust with all Fidelity, and are now come humbly to lay before Your Majesty, the Articles and Conditions of Union which we have Treated of, and agreed
<PB N="104" REF="199"/>
upon, and do submit them to Your Majesties Royal Considerati∣on.</P>
<P>It is a great satisfaction to us, that what we have concluded in this Matter, has been done with Unanimity; and we must own, that the knowledge we had of Your Majesties great Concern for Uniting Your two Kingdoms, and the Earnestness with which Your Majesty has been most Graciously pleased to Recomend it, hath en∣abled us to bring this Treaty to a happy and speedy Conclusion, to the mutual Satisfaction of the Commissioners on both sides; and we shall esteem it our greatest Happiness, if what we have prepared be acceptable to Your Majesty, and Ratified by the Parliaments of both Kingdoms, without which, what we have done can be of no Au∣thority.</P>
<P>An Union of the two Kingdoms has been long wish'd for, it be∣ing so necessary for Establishing the lasting Peace, Happiness and Prosperity of both Nations; And tho it has been frequently Endea∣voured by Your Majesties Royal Predecessors without the desir'd Suc∣cess; Yet the Glorious Successes, with which GOD has Bless'd Your Majesties Endeavours for the Happiness of Your People, make us Hope that this Great Work is Reserv'd to be accomplished in Your Majesties Reign.</P></Q></P>
<P>After which, Her Majesty was Graciously pleased to make the following Speech.<Q><P><HI>My Lords,</HI></P>
<P>I Give you many Thanks for the great Pains you have taken in this Treaty, and am very well pleas'd to find your Endeavours and Applications have brought it to so Good a Conclusion. The Par∣ticulars of it seem so Reasonable, That I hope they will meet with Approbation in the Parliaments of both Kingdoms. I wish there∣fore, That my Servants of <HI>Scotland</HI> may lose no time in going down to propose it to my Subjects of that Kingdom; And I shall always look upon it as a particular Happiness, if this Union (which will be so great a Security, and Advantage to both Kingdoms) can be Accomplish'd in my Reign.</P></Q></P>

<HEAD>OF THE Carrying of the TREATY in SCOTLAND.</HEAD>
<P>AND thus the Treaty at <HI>London</HI> ended, which, tho' it seemed very perfect in all its parts, and as abundance of People thought, could not want any Corrections, yet as by the sequel appeared, the most difficult Work was yet to do.</P>
<P>I know some were of the Opinion, that this Treaty could admit of no Additions, Amendments or Alterations, and that the Words in the respective Acts of Parliament previous to it, (which said, <HI>Provided that nothing in this Treaty should be binding to either Nation, unless it shall be Ratified in the respective Parliament of both Kingdoms</HI>) Implyed that the respective Parliaments had no Power to enter into the Articles separately and apart, but only debating on the whole, to Approve or Disapprove, Ratifie or Reject it as a Treaty.</P>
<P>I shall not Trouble the Reader with any of the Reasons given for this Notion, nor make any other Remark upon it than this,—That the People who were for this Opinion were of two sorts, and both such as the Nations on either side, were very little behol∣ding to.</P>
<P N="1">1. They were such, who having no great Concern for the essential part of the Treaty, <HI>viz. The Good of their Country,</HI> were for taking all upon Trust, and concerned not themselves either with the Event, or with the Circumstances, and therefore without any Dif∣ficulty were willing to put all upon a meer plurality of Voices, not much regarding whether it went this way or that. I shall be Kinder to these Gentlemen than to Record their Names, or leave them (so eminent in Folly) to be known by Posterity, lest their Children should be told hereafter how little their Country was obliged to them.</P>
<P N="2">2. The other sort, whose Follies ought equally to be concealed, I mean as to Naming them, were such who were willing to have them put to the Question in Gross; Presuming,<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That either their being so Voted, would hand them down Clogg'd with so many Inconveniencies as would in Time force the Nations to break the Articles, or bringing them to the necessity of falling to pieces, the Treaty should Dissolve of Course. Or,</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That being Voted in general, with so many apparent Dif∣ficulties as they pretended to see in them, they would infallibly be lost in this Parliament, and so as formerly, the whole Treaty come to nothing.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="213"/>
That these People aim'd not at shortning the Labour, but at cutting off the Union it self, is manifest, and it was but too appa∣rent afterwards; since Debates, and that in every Article; by which they plainly made it appear, that they did not argue so much to Rectify and Amend as to Destroy, not so much to make the Articles more Perfect, or more Explicit, more Advantagious, or more Satisfying, but to annihilate them as Articles, and dissolve the very Life and Being of the Treaty: And this appeared in that, thro' all the Debates that happened afterwards, they shew'd themselves equal∣ly against every Article, and at the same time that they Objected against things, very seldome concern'd themselves, to propose the Alternatives, but rather pusht at overthrowing the substance of the thing; and if possible, to Urge the most Necessary Articles as Im∣practicable and Inconsistent.</P>
<P>As on the one Hand, this discovered the Design of the Persons to be <HI>not Amending,</HI> but Destroying the Articles: So it manifestly exposed their Ignorance, either of their own Strength in <HI>Scotland,</HI> or of the Strength of their Friends in the South, in both which parts, (had their weak Politicks prevailed to have put the Treaty in general to a Vote) they would have lost it by a Majority of Voices, the generality of both Nations being fully Convinc'd of the absolute Necessity of a Union, and would rather have Voted it without the Amendments than have lost it.</P>
<P>If I am ask'd how I prove this, I think I have a very good Foundation for it.<LIST>
<ITEM>1. In the Motions first made in the Parliament House in <HI>Scot∣land, November</HI> 1. 1706, when the strength of the House, as they call it, was effectually Tryed.<LIST>
<ITEM>1. It was Moved that the Parliament now proceed to the farther and more particular Consideration of the Articles of the Union, in order to Approve them or not.
<P>☞ Nota, <HI>The Articles had been Read and Discoursed on severally in the House, and had taken up sixteen Days, barely Reading them one by one, to hear what one another could say, and to give the Members Light into the particulars,</HI> viz. <HI>from the fifteenth of</HI> October, <HI>to the first of</HI> November.</P></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Upon this first Motion another followed, <HI>viz.</HI> That the farther Consideration of the Union be yet delayed for some considerable Time, that the Sentiments of the Parliament of <HI>England</HI> thereanent be known, and that the Members of Parliament may Consult those they Represent.—<HI>Vide</HI> the Minuts of Parliament, <HI>Numb.</HI> 13. But neither of these Attempts could be Carried in the House, nor could they bring the Moti∣on to a Vote in the Terms the Proposal was made, <HI>viz.</HI> Of Consulting Constituents, or waiting till the <HI>English</HI> Parliament should Sit.—To both which I shall speak in their Turn.—I only mention it here, to show that it was apparent these Motions proceeded only from a desire to gain Time, which they
<PB N="3" REF="214"/>
thought might furnish a variety of Accidents to disappoint the whole.—And the many weak Attempts and low Steps some Gentlemen took, if possible, to delay the proceedings, plainly shew'd the very juncture of Time when this was doing, was one of the greatest Unhappinesses, <HI>as they thought it,</HI> which befell the Party.</ITEM>
</LIST></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. But I prove this further by the Unanimity of the <HI>English</HI> Par∣liament in passing the Treaty, and Ratifying without any Amend∣ment, what they thought they had Clogg'd with so many Inequa∣lities, on the other side, that it could never go down with them.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>I shall further convince the Reader of the manifest Design of the Party against the Union, <HI>as such,</HI>—from their frequent Attempts to Clog the Articles with such Things as they knew it was impossible the Parliament of <HI>England</HI> could grant—as a Liberty to Export Wool, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> different Draw-backs, and different Prohibitions in Trade, differing and disproportioned Excises, Customs and Taxes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of which I shall take the Freedom to speak in their Turn.</P>
<P>But being disappointed in these, they found the Parliament of <HI>England</HI> so Unanimous that they past all their Amendments, some of which were such, as the Party having meerly Clamour'd the House into, were really past, not so much for any Respect to their true Signification, as for the sake of giving some Satisfaction to Uneasie People.</P>
<P>How much more then the Parliament of <HI>England</HI> would have past the whole Treaty Unaltered, is very evident, and consequently 'tis as plain that these People had taken no aim in their offering to Vote the Articles in the gross, upon a Presumption that it would be a mean to make the whole miscarry.</P>
<P>The Treaty being concluded in <HI>England,</HI> and the Commissioners separated; The next thing was the Meeting of the respective Par∣liaments of the two Kingdoms for Ratification of the Articles.</P>
<P>The Parliament of <HI>Scotland</HI> was first, being to meet the third of <HI>October</HI> 1706.—The Queen was Represented in this Parliament by the Duke of <HI>Queensberry.</HI>—I know 'tis not the part of a Historian to make Panegericks, and I think I have given Demonstrations to the World, as to my self, that I will flatter no Man—But I cannot but give this Testimony here, that the Prudence, Calmness, Temper and Moderation of this Noble Person had these two visible Effects.<LIST>
<ITEM>1. It gave a wonderful Testimony to the Queens Judgment, and the right Notions she had entertained of the true state, not of Her Affairs only, but of Her People; that Her Majesty knew this Work must be carried on, not by too much Fire or too much Water, neither by want of Zeal or too much Zeal, That here was an insolent Party to deal with, who must be born with, not Exasperated, Calm'd not Enraged; That here would be as much Difficulty required to deal with Friends as with Enemies, to Reconcile Jarring Interests, Clashing Parties, and keep all in Temper.—Here was a strong Party for the Union,
<PB N="4" REF="215"/>
but they were made up of several Parties, just come together as for the Occasion; They were like <HI>Epicurus</HI>'s Attoms by a strange fortuitous Chance of concurring Circumstances brought to joyn in this, who were perfect Antipodes in all their former measures, and could never agree to act together before; It was not a Matter of the least Consequence to bring together and keep to∣gether, strong and differing Parties, who acted even in this very Thing, from different Views, and some with directly contrary Designs,—and it was all the way as Fatiguing to keep some Gentlemen in suited Temper, for this great Work, as to oppose the Fire and Fury of those that set themselves against it.—Under the solid Consideration of all this, and with a full view of the Difficulties, at least in general, Her Majesty pitches upon the Duke of <HI>Queensberry,</HI> as a Person of Temper, Prudence and Moderation, unexceptionable in Knowledge of what was before him, resolute in pursuing it thro' all Difficulties, and of a calm Courage in all the passive part of it, of which I shall speak more at large hereafter.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. It had this particular Advantage, that it was in a great Measure the only thing that carried this difficult Work on, That the Duke in all the Heats and Animosities of the Party, in all the Convulsions of the Kingdom, carried on the Treaty with Easiness, Temper and extraordinary Conduct, not taking Advantages of the Rashness and Rudeness of the People, Pity∣ing rather than apprehending Danger from their Folly, he kept his hand upon the Work, his Eye upon the principals of the Opposite Party, he disappointed all their Measures, he let himself into the Darkest of their Counsels,—he pursued the main and great Work in hand,—and with a Contempt, above my power to express, received all their Insults, laught at their Threatnings, Treated them Courteously and Calmly, under the most intollerable Carriage,—and this under the supream Conduct, was the only Step by which this great Work could have been brought to pass.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Had warmer Heads been listned to, had Resentment been pre∣vailing, had Provocations, almost beyond the power of Flesh and Blood to bear, been prevailing,—<HI>and I must own, who was an Eye Witness to it all, that I often wondred how it was possible to bear such things;</HI> I say, had the Gentlemen of Warmer Heads been listned to, nay even with strong Reasonings, and from Men of sound Judgments too,—all had been undone, and the Nation had been in a Flame, we had been destroyed not delivered, the Government had been dissolved, not United, and <HI>Britain</HI> had by this time been the Seat of Blood, not an United and prospering Nation.</P>
<P>But this by the way, the Parliament being to meet, Her Majesties high Commissioner hastned down to <HI>Scotland,</HI> and the Queen on all Occasions, expressing Her Hopes that this Treaty would come to a happy Issue.—It was generally expected it would be received with the same Chearfulness and Alacrity in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and all our Eyes were bent upon the Meeting of the Approaching Parliament.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="216"/>
In this general Expectation, I cannot forbear hinting here, that my Curiosity prest me to take a Journey thither, and being by all my Friends, to whom I communicated my Design, encouraged, to think I might be useful there to prompt a Work that I was fully convinced was for the general Good of the whole Island; and particularly necessary for the strengthning the Protestant Interest, I was moved purely on these Accounts to undertake a long Winter, a Chargeable, and as it proved, a Hazardous Journey.—</P>
<P>I contemn, as not worth mentioning, the Suggestions of some People, of my being imployed thither, to carry on the In∣terest of a Party.—I have never loved any Parties, but, with my utmost Zeal have sincerely Espoused the Great and Original Interest of this Nation, and of all Nations, I mean Truth and Liberty,—and who ever are of that Party, I desire to be with them.</P>
<P>However, by this Journey, I had the Opportunity of Seeing and Hearing all the Particulars of the following Transactions, and of using my best Endeavours to Answer the many, many, and I must say of some of them, the most frivolous and ridiculous Objections, formed and improved there with great Industry, against every Article of the Union; and this is my Reason for mentioning it here, that I may acquaint Posterity how I came to the Knowledge of what I Write, and for no Ostentation at all: And as I had the Honour to be frequently sent for into the several Committees of Parliament, which were appointed to state some difficult Points relating to Equalities, Taxes, Prohibitions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> 'Tis for those Gentlemen to say, whether I was useful or not, that's none of my Business here; but by this means I have the greater Assurance to relate the Circum∣stances and Fact as it stood before them, and can not be afraid of being detected in any material Mistake.</P>
<P>And as this is the Reason of my making any mention of my self, so the Reader cannot but be content to know, from what Foundation this Relation is handed down to Posterity, and what assurance he has that the Author he Reads was Capable of giving him a right state of the Matter.</P>
<P>I have hinted already with what Freedom the Scriblers of the Age, if I may give them that Title, took upon them in the begin∣ing of this Affair, to Determine what sort of Union was proper to be Treated of, and every one having vented his Politicks this way and that way, as his Interest or Party, or particular Imployer Dictated, we thought that Storm had been over; when the Parliament first Sat down in <HI>Scotland,</HI> the generality of People seem'd very easy and forward for a Union in general, as what had long indeed been the desire of the whole Nation; and therefore the strange Alienation of the Humours of the People, on the general part of it, was the more Wonderful, and the more Unexpected: Of which, and its Causes, I am now to speak; of the Effects I shall be more particular hereafter.</P>
<P>On the third of <HI>October</HI> the Parliament met, his Grace Her Majesties High Commissioner opened the Session according to the usual Forms.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="217"/>First Her Majesties Letter to the Parliament was presented to the House by the High Commissioner, and being received, was Read by the <HI>Lord Clerk Register,</HI> and is as follows.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lords and Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SINCE your last Meeting, We did Nominat Commissioners to Treat of an Union betwixt Our two Kingdoms of <HI>Scot∣land</HI> and <HI>England,</HI> and by their great Care and Diligence, a Treaty, is happily concluded and laid before Us.</P>
<P>We have called You together as soon as Our Affairs could Per∣mit, That the Treaty may be under Your Consideration, in Pur∣suance of the Act made in the last Session of Our Parliament there; and We hope the Terms will be acceptable to You.</P>
<P>The Union has been long Desired by both Nations, and We shall Esteem it as the greatest Glory of Our Reign to have it now Perfected, being fully perswaded, That it must prove the greatest Happiness of Our People.</P>
<P>An intire and perfect Union will be the solid Foundation of lasting Peace; It will secure Your Religion, Liberty and Proper∣ty, remove the Animosities amongst Your Selves, and the Jea∣lousies and Differences betwixt Our two Kingdoms: It must in∣crease Your Strength, Riches and Trade, and by this Union the whole Island being joyned in Affection, and free from all Ap∣prehension of different Interests, will be enabled to Resist all its Enemies, support the Protestant Interest every where, and main∣tain the Liberties of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>We do upon this Occasion Renew the Assurances We have formerly given You, of Our Resolution to maintain the Govern∣ment of the Church, as by Law Established in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and the Acts of both Parliaments, upon which this Treaty proceeded, having reserved their respective Governments of the Church in each Kingdom; the Commissioners have left that Matter Entire; and you have now an Opportunity for doing what may be necessary for Security of Your present Church Government after the Union within the Limits of SCOTLAND.</P>
<P>The support of our Government, and your Own Safety does Re∣quire, That You do make necessary Provision for Maintaining the Forces, Ships and Garisons, until the Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> shall provide for these Ends in the United King∣dom.</P>
<P>We have made choice of our Right Trustie, and Right Entirely Beloved Cousin and Counsellor, <HI>James</HI> Duke of <HI>Queensberry,</HI> to be Our Commissioner, and Represent Our Royal Person, being well satisfyed with his Fitness for that Trust, from the Experience We have of his Capacity, Zeal and Fidelity to Our Service, and
<PB N="7" REF="218"/>
the Good of his Countrey; which, as it has determined Us in the Choice, We doubt not but will make him acceptable to You.</P>
<P>We have fully Instructed him in all things We think may fall under Your Consideration, and seems to be necessary at pre∣sent: Therefore We desire that you may give entire Trust and Credit to him.</P>
<P><HI>My Lords and Gentlemen,</HI></P>
<P>It cannot but be an Encouragement to You to Finish the Union at this Time, That GOD Almighty has blessed Our Arms, and those of Our Allies with so great Success, which gives Us the nearer Prospect of a happy Peace, and with it You will have the full Possession of all the Advantages of this Union; and You have no Reason to doubt but the Parliament of <HI>England</HI> will do what is necessary on their part, after the Readiness they have shown to remove what might obstruct the entering on the Treaty. We most earnestly Recommend to You Calmness and Unanimity in this Great and Weighty Affair, That the Union may be brought to a happy Conclusion, being the only effectual Way to secure your present and future Happiness, and to Disappoint the Designs of Our and Your Enemies, who will doubtless on this Occasion, use their outmost Endeavours to Prevent or Delay this Union, which must so much Contribute to our Glory, and the Happiness of Our People; And so We bid You heartily Fare∣well. <HI>Given at Our Court at</HI> Windsor Castle <HI>the thirty first Day of</HI> July 1706, <HI>and of Our Reign the Fifth Year.</HI></P>

<P>This Letter having been twice Read, the Duke of <HI>Queensberry</HI> seconded the Queens Letter with the following Speech.<Q><P><HI>My Lords and Gentlemen,</HI></P>
<P>HER Majesty, by Her Gracious Letter, has acquainted You, That the Treaty of Union, between the King∣doms of <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>England</HI> (pursuant to an Act made in your last Session) has been happily agreed on, which is now in my Lord Registers Hands, ready to be laid before You.</P>
<P>The Lords Commissioners for this Kingdom, have been Dili∣gent and Zealous in concerting Just and Reasonable Terms; and, it must be acknowledged, We met with a very Fair and Friendly Disposition in the Lords Commissioners on the other Part.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="219"/>
The Treaty has, with all Humility, been presented to the Queen, and was most Graciously received; and tho' no Reign was ever so truly Great, for Wise and Steady Councils, and so many Important Successes, as that of Her Majesty; yet, you see, She is pleased to Esteem the Perfecting of this Union, as the greatest Glory of Her Reign, being the most solid Founda∣tion of a lasting Security to the Protestant Religion, and the Liberties of <HI>Europe,</HI> and of Peace and Happiness to Her People.</P>
<P>These Reasons, I doubt not, will make the Treaty acceptable to You; And I perswade my self that you will proceed with such Calmness and Impartiality, as the Weight of the Subject Requires, and as becomes so great an Assembly.</P>
<P>The Lords Commissioners for both Kingdoms were Limited in the Matter of Church Government; For the Security of Pres∣byterian Government in this Church, you have the Laws already made for its Establishment, the Queens Repeated Assurances to preserve it, and I am Impowered to Consent to what may be further necessary after the Union.</P>
<P>Her Majesty has been pleased to Recommend to You to make Provision for the Forces, Ships and Garisons, which is very necessary, the Subsidies granted at Your last Meeting being run out; so, I doubt not, You will speedily Renew them.</P>
<P><HI>My Lords and Gentlemen,</HI></P>
<P>I am not insensible of the Difficulties that attend the Weighty Character, it has pleased Her Majesty to Honour me with, but with your favourable Assistance, (upon which I very much Rely) I hope, by my Zeal and Fidelity for Her Majesties Service, and the Good of my Countrey, which are inseparable, to Discharge my Duty on this extraordinary Occasion.</P></Q></P>
<P>And this was followed with another Speech by the Earl of <HI>Sea∣field</HI> Lord Chancellor of <HI>Scotland,</HI> which I have also inserted here, as follows<Q><P><HI>My Lords and Gentlemen,</HI></P>
<P>IT hath been, and is the great Happiness of this Nation, That the Queen Our Sovereign, hath always made it the chief Design of Her Reign, to protect Her Subjects, in the Enjoy∣ment of all their Rights and Privileges, to Promove their Good, and to Establish their Peace and Prosperity, upon sure and lasting Foundations.</P>
<P>For these Ends, Her Majesty, in Her most Gracious Letter, doth, with great Earnestness, Recommend to You the Conclu∣ding of the Union of the Two Kingdoms, and has plainly and
<PB N="9" REF="220"/>
fully laid before You the great Advantages that this Union must bring with it to all <HI>BRITAIN,</HI> and in particular to this King∣dom.</P>
<P>The Lords Commissioners Named by Her Majesty for this Kingdom to Treat of this Union, have endeavoured to Dis∣charge this great Trust, with all Fidelity, and have Agreed to such Terms and Conditions, as, I hope, shall be found Just, Honourable and Advantageous: The Treaty has been already received very Graciously by Her Majesty, and is now ready to be Reported to you for your Consideration.</P>
<P>I do not think it proper at this time to descend into the particular Articles of the Treaty; I shall only beg leave to say in general, That it must be of great Advantage to have this whole Island Unite under one Government, and Conjoyned Intirely in Interest and Affection, having Equality of all Rights and Privileges, with a free Communication and Intercourse of Trade, which must certainly Establish Our Security, Augment Our Strength, and Increase Our Trade and Riches.</P>
<P>We can never expect a more favourable Juncture for Com∣pleating this Union, than at present, when Her Majesty has not only Recommended it, but Declared, That She will Esteem it the greatest Glory of Her Reign, to have it perfected; And when the Parliament of <HI>England</HI> has shown their Inclinations for it, by Removing all these Obstacles that did ly in the way of the Treaty: And it must also be acknowledged, that the Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> did Testify their good Disposition all along in this Affair: And the Great and Glorious Successes wherewith GOD has Blessed Her Majesties Arms, and those of Her Allies, give us the Hope of a Near and Advantageous Peace, whereby we will be put in the Possession, and attain to the full Enjoyment of all the Liberties and Privileges of Trade, now offered by the Treaty.</P>
<P>The Commissioners of both Sides, have only Treated of such Things as concern the Civil Government, Liberties, Privileges, Trade, and Taxes; but found themselves Limited as to the Church-Government, that being Reserved to each Kingdom by the respective Acts of Parliament, upon which the Treaty pro∣ceeded: And you have now not only the Laws already made, with Her Majesties most Gracious Repeated Assurances, for maintaining and continuing Presbyterian Church-Government within this Kingdom; But this further Opportunity of making such Conditions and Provisions, as shall be found Necessary for its Security, after the Conclusion of this Union, within the Li∣mits of <HI>SCOTLAND.</HI></P>
<P>Her Majesty Recommends to You to provide the necessary Sup∣plies for the Troops, Garisons and Ships; The Funds formerly given are expired: And therefore I doubt not, but you will easily comply with what is so plainly Necessary for the Preserva∣tion of the publick Safety, and preventing the Designs of Ene∣mies now in time of War.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="221"/>
<HI>My Lords and Gentlemen,</HI></P>
<P>Since We have now the Opportunity of Establishing for Our Selves and Our Posterity, by this Union with <HI>England,</HI> all that concerns Our Religion and Liberties, together with the most valuable Privileges of Trade; I am hopeful, that You will proceed to the Consideration of the Articles of the Treaty, in such manner as shall bring it to the desired Conclusion, and it cannot but tend to the lasting Honour of this Session of Parlia∣ment, to have so happily finished this most Important and Weigh∣ty Matter.</P></Q></P>
<P>I choose to place these Speeches here, rather than in the <HI>Appen∣dix,</HI> because they so immediatly relate to the Story, and to the Con∣tinuance of the Thread of the Story, which now comes to be Dis∣coursed of, that I thought they could not be so properly Transposed.</P>
<P>I shall not enter here into the particular Vote of every Day, hav∣ing Abstracted those things by way of Journal, in another part of the Work, with Notes upon them, drawn from my own Observation, and from the generous Assistance of many Honourable Gentlemen present in the very Occurrences of every Day, and of Impartial Un∣byassed Judgment in the Affair it self;—But one thing I must remark here, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>The first thing the House did, after the Speeches above, was to call for the Treaty of the Union, as it was drawn up and signed by the Commissioners,—and having caused it to be Read in the House.—Upon some general Debate, which lasted not long, it was Ordered to be Printed, and Copies to be Delivered to the Members of Parliament, which was accordingly done.</P>
<P>Till this very Day all things had gone on well, and the Peo∣ple in general were very well pleased with the Thoughts of the Union—They had not yet had Subject for the Turbulent Spirits to work upon, and having in general only Discoursed upon the Advantages of both sides, which were indeed in themselves visible enough,—the Clamorous Party which followed had not Concerted their Measures, from what Topicks to work upon the Humours of the People.</P>
<P>No sooner then were the Articles Printed, and put into the Hands of the People,—but the Gentlemen, who set themselves up against them, began to Preach upon the general Heads, as their Humour and Talent instructed them, in order to possess the People against the Particulars.</P>
<P>I cannot but distinguish here between the several parties that now opposed the Union: In my Observation there were Four several sorts of People, who were against this Treaty, and who, either within Doors, or without, either in Parliament, in Commission, or in Conver∣sation, joyned to Oppose, Clamour at, or Object against the Union;

and 'tis really necessary here to distinguish of them, that when I talk, <HI>as I shall have frequent Occasion in the Process of this Story,</HI> of the Opposers, and the Parties Opposing, it may, by the man∣ner of their Opposing, be distinguisht who is mean't; For I shall not name Persons in my Discourse of those things, not think∣ing it necessary to make this History a Satyr upon any one Family, or Record to Posterity the Steps they took in particular, or their Reasons for it in this Affair.</P>
<P>Where particular Actions, more than ordinary publick, have di∣stinguished Persons, that is their own Act and Deed, and lyes not at my Door; But to come to the Heads of Parties.</P>
<P N="1">1. There was the profest <HI>Jacobite</HI> Party who Opposed the Treaty, purely on the Account of the Succession, which they saw evidently was struck at, and would be effectually fixt, contrary to their Prin∣ciples, and Eternally Exclusive of the Family they Adhered to; And these Declared their Aversion to the Union, upon all Occasi∣ons, publickly and fairly, and, for ought I know, were some of the honestest of the Enemies to the Treaty.</P>
<P N="2">2. There was the Diffenters from the Church, or the Episcopal Party, these Opposed the Union also publickly, as it tended in its Consequences, entirely to settle the Presbyterian Establishment, for ever to fore-close them, and bar the Door against all possibility of their Recovering the Government of the Church in the manner they desired; Since they saw but too plainly, however blind others were to it, that this Treaty would so settle the Presbyterian Esta∣blishment in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and so fortify it by Law, that if ever they should attempt to Recover the Hierarchy of Episcopacy here, even the very Episcopal Church, their own Brethren in <HI>England,</HI> would be obliged to Oppose and Suppress them.—And these, so far as they acted fairly, were honest and open Enemies also to the Union.</P>
<P N="3">3. There was a mistaken People, <HI>I hope I may say so much of my own Opinion without Offence, for truly I think them mistaken,</HI> who, tho this Union was calculated entirely for their Safety, and tended to their indissoluble Establishment, as by the Alarm of their Enemies was very visibly demonstrated, yet were drawn in by their Fears, and, I doubt, those Fears too much inflam'd by the Policy and wick∣ed Artifice of Whisperers and disguised Enemies, to Oppose the U∣nion, as dangerous to the Church, and as interfereing with the se∣veral publick Engagements the Nation had entered into.—These, or most of them, were Honest, Well-meaning, and some of them most pious and valuable People; However some of them might sin a∣gainst Moderation in the manner of their Dissenting, and a little too warmly push on their private Opinions.</P>
<P>Of these People I shall be far from saying any thing severe, for indeed I cannot think any thing ill of them, I mean as to Inten∣tional Evil. The Weakness any of them might discover in for∣warding, countenancing, or giving a Name to the Disorders of the Times, was rather the Artifice of a Party, who eneavoured to En∣flame the Nation, and put the Appearance of it upon them, Writ∣ing
<PB N="12" REF="223"/>
their Names upon every Action, and Intituling every Tumult to their Protection.</P>
<P>But descending to particulars, we shall find; that however forward, and if their Enemies desire it, I'll venture to say, Indiscreet some of them might be, in discovering their Sentiments with Warmth in Conversation, yet upon all publick Occasions their whole Oppositi∣on of the Treaty was confin'd to legal Applications and peaceable Endeavours, the Tumult at <HI>Dumfries</HI> only excepted; For as to that of <HI>Glasgow,</HI> it was wholly <HI>Jacobite,</HI> meer Rabble and Tumult of that Party, and the poor Blinded Commonality Deluded and Imposed upon by them, contrary to the Opinions, and without the Assistance of the People I am speaking of, as will appear hereaf∣ter.</P>
<P N="4">4. But lastly, There was a Party, who Vigorously and Violently, by all manner of Artifice, Trick, and Underhand Dealing, Opposed this Union, meerly upon Politick <HI>Enigmas,</HI> Reasons of Party, found∣ed upon State Principles, Ambition, Emulation, Party-Pick, Pre∣judices, and a vast variety of unhappy Conjunctions, as serv'd to Enflame and Agitate their Spirits against it.—And as these were many of them Gentlemen of the first Rank, and some of them other∣wise even well enough Affected to both the Succession, and to the Church; So I shall show more Respect to their Persons, than to Record them in a Case which I promise my self, they will some time or other reckon it their Misfortune to have Opposed, and per∣haps be as Zealous now its finished to preserve, as they were before it was finished, to prevent.</P>
<P>Yet I must Confess, it was to these Gentlemen we owe the Amu∣sing the Nation with so many unhappy Prejudices, the Alarming them with such ungrounded Apprehensions, and the Embarking the Common People against it, meerly on the appearing of such Men in it, on whose Judgments, and on whose Quality they had so much Dependence.</P>
<P>These were the Fatal People against this Treaty, these struggled within Doors and without, these brought to pass that monstrous Conjunction of Opposite and Discording Parties, and brought the <HI>Jacobites</HI> to cry out for the Succession, the Episcopal People to want Security for the Presbyterian Church, the Tory to cry out, Breach of Covenant, and the well Minded Presbyterian ignorantly excite the People to a Rabble.</P>
<P>These went about Preaching Opposition in every Shape, just as it suited the People they had to do with, they undertook to join <HI>Came∣ronian</HI> and Persecutor; Presbyterian and Papist; Protestant Succession and <HI>Jacobitism;</HI> Parties as Opposite as the Elements, as Distant as the <HI>Poles;</HI> And these are the People I desire to be understood of, when in this Book I talk in general of the Opposers of this Uni∣on, I Name no Body, whoever the Coat fits, they are Welcome to wear it.</P>
<P>Having thus described the Parties, it would be endless to enter into their several Methods, by which they Concurr'd together, <HI>I do</HI>
<PB N="13" REF="224"/>
<HI>not say Confederated,</HI> for that was Impracticable, their several Aims consider'd; But all concurr'd nevertheless, to put the Manage∣ment of this Affair into the following Confusions.</P>
<P>Till the Printing of these Articles, as I have already noted, the People were generally very desirous of the Union, as a thing which tended to the putting an end to all former Animosities, bury∣ing the ancient Feuds between the Nations, and removing the Ap∣prehensions good People on both sides had justly entertain'd of a new Rupture, in case of the Queens Demise.</P>
<P>But no sooner were these Articles printed and dispers'd, but as if every Body had set themselves to raise Objections, form Scruples, and find Faults in them, the whole Nation fell into a general kind of Labour, in Canvassing, Banding, and Cavilling at the Conditions.</P>
<P N="1">1. The poor People were terrifyed with the Apprehensions of insupportable Taxes, Loss of Imployment, Want of all Things, and large Payments upon their Salt and Malt.</P>
<P>They were again filled with strange Stories of being sold to the <HI>English;</HI> their Parliament, Crown, Scepter, and even their Name as a Nation to be lost, and all carryed to <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. The Merchants were frighted with printed Schemes of Exces∣sive Customs and Impositions, and the strangest Projects of Trade were spread about the Kingdom that ever were seen, which being gotten into the Heads of those People, who yet, by their Concern in Trade, one would have thought, in common Charity, should have known better, were so managed, that it is hardly possible to believe, such preposterous Notions could prevail upon People, o∣therwise Knowing enough; Such as, 1. The Profitableness of a Trade to <HI>France,</HI> tho all the Returns from thence was in perishable Goods, such as Wines, Brandy, and Trifles for Consumption at Home.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Unprofitableness of a Trade to <HI>England,</HI> whither their Export of Cattle and Linen, amounting to above Two Hundred Thousand Pound <HI>Sterling per Annum,</HI> brought back very little but ready Money.</P>
<P>Those were strange things, but so popularly push'd on, that they amused the whole Nation, and the poor People were told, the Uni∣on would beggar the Country, and starve the Nation; And this talk'd up to an Extravagant Height, made the poor perfectly di∣stracted.—Taxes were calculated, without allowing for the Ad∣vantages of the Customs, in other Cases taken off, without conside∣ring the Taxes on Malt and Salt were remote, and probable never to be laid, without considering Proportions, Equalities, and the Reasons, Nature, or Necessity of things, that the poor People were Exasperated to the highest Degree, and fill'd with Apprehensions, that they should have neither Food to eat, nor Beer to drink, that they were just to be sacrificed to the <HI>English,</HI> be subdued, ruin'd and destroy'd.</P>
<P N="3">3. Those Articles, which left some things Contingent to the Par∣liamentary Jurisdiction, were improved to perswade the People, that
<PB N="14" REF="225"/>
all their Laws, Liberties, Estates, and whatever was near and dear to them, was left intirely to the Determination and absolute Dis∣posal of the <HI>British</HI> Parliament; In which, they being to have but a small Representation, supposing their own Members to be always Unbyass'd and Impartial, they should always be Over-ruled, Out∣voted, Oppress'd and Subjected: To talk to them, in this Case, of the Words <HI>Ʋnalterable</HI> and <HI>Perpetual,</HI> was to say nothing; To say, the <HI>British</HI> Parliament could make no Alterations, was to say nothing. These things had so filled the Heads of the People, that nothing could pacify them.</P>
<P N="4">4. But above all this, and which was yet most unhappy, as it tended to an universal Alarm, and to Embark a great many Sober and well Affected People against it, it was carefully represented to be Dangerous to the Church Government, That all the Establish∣ment would be subjected to a Vote of Parliament, and a Parliament, where the Prelates had a Voice against them; that if the Bishops should please to Vote Episcopacy into <HI>Scotland,</HI> they getting a Majo∣rity in the Parliament, it would be done; that the Church would be ruin'd; that if she obtain'd a Tolleration, it was the most that could be expected in this Case, and that was precarious and uncer∣tain, and what they must come a begging to the Bishops for. This made an unspeakable Disorder in the Minds of the People, and all the Methods taken to convince them, that the Parliament could not encroach upon the Church, or any ways concern themselves about it, were to no purpose; they declared the Act of Security to be insufficient, railed at the <HI>Scots</HI> Parliaments consenting in blank to the Establish∣ment of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and inveighed against a Tolleration of Episcopacy here, which they said would be the Consequence.</P>
<P N="5">5. And last of all came an Universal Cry, that this was a plain Breach of the National Covenant and Solemn League, by which the Nation had bound themselves by Oath to GOD Almighty, among other things, to endeavour the pulling down the Episcopal Hierar∣chy, and to Reform, to the utmost of their Power, the Church of <HI>England</HI> also.—All these things were not only brought as Argu∣ments, but push'd with so much Heat, so much want of Charity and Courtesy, that really it began to break all good Neighbourhood, it sowred all Societies, and the National Quarrel broke into Families, who were ever jangling, divided, and opposite one among another.—Nor was there any offering the Expositions, no not of their own Di∣vines, who had declared, that the Obligations of the Covenant intitul∣ed them to no other Endeavour of Reforming the Church of <HI>England,</HI> but such as consisted in Prayers, Exhortations, Christian Arguments and Examples, <HI>Vide</HI> Doctor <HI>Rule</HI>'s <HI>Vindication of the Church of</HI> Scot∣land, <HI>P.</HI> 16. However there was no talking to the People at this Time, nothing but Patience and Time could be expected to remedy it.</P>
<P>In this Juncture, and if possible to compleat the Distracti∣ons of the People, one Gentleman, by Name Mr. <HI>Hodges,</HI> and who had formerly been supposed to write for the Common Good of <HI>Scot∣land,</HI> and was rewarded for it by Parliament, by what Fate, Party,
<PB N="15" REF="226"/>
Passion or Prejudice, remains to this day a Doubt,—writes a large Book against an Incorporate Union; In which he abuses and reproaches <HI>England,</HI> as a Faithless, Wicked, Treacherous and Abo∣minable Nation, and that to Unite with her, was to Entail GODs Judgment on <HI>Scotland</HI> for her National Sins. A sad Instance of the Temper of these Times.</P>
<P>In this Book he sets down Two and Thirty Interfereing Interests between the Nations, which he pretends 'tis impossible to re∣concile: 'Tis writ with Infinite Scandal and Falsity; and among the rest, and as a Test of the Sincerity of the Party, he affirms these palpable Untruths.<LIST>
<ITEM>1<HI>st,</HI> That in Commerce, the <HI>English</HI> Trade to the <HI>West-Indies</HI> is carryed on in Exclusive Companies, by which, the letting the <HI>Scots</HI> into that Trade, was an <HI>English</HI> Cheat.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That all the Ecclesiastical State of the Church was left at the Mercy of a <HI>British</HI> Parliament.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. That the Members of Parliament in <HI>England</HI> were obliged to take the Sacrament of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> before they were admitted to sit in the House.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>This is not a place to confute these things, they did not want their Answer in their Season, and the People in time did be∣gin to see their Error, and how this Author had, by manifest For∣gery, imposed upon them.—But still this did the Mischief it was calculated for, before any Answer could take place; for this Book was eagerly espoused by the Party, and there was no room to que∣stion it was writ at their private Appointment: It was industriously spread over all the Kingdom in a few days, and no Body of any Con∣sideration but had a sight of it; nay, it was handed about among the poor People, to stir them up and enflame them, and it had all the Suc∣cess the wickedest Creature could wish for; It confounded and amaz∣ed the People, the dark Side of every thing was shown them, and the true Sense of things concealed, and who can but think the People thus abused should run out into Extravagancies.</P>
<P>It is not so much, that a Book fraught with Absurdities, Falsi∣ties and Contradictions, merits a Note in this Work: But I think 'tis absolutely necessary, to shew where the general Disaffection at the Union began, since it was manifest, that, till this time, the People were, in general, very well satisfyed, and the Prospect of an Union was very grateful to them.</P>
<P>It cannot but be some Satisfaction to all those who have heartily espoused this Union, that the Opposition had such a beginning; that its Foundation was laid in the Party-Prejudices of a few, whose Refuge and Support was the meer Assistance of Falsities and unpa∣rallel'd Forgeries, by which the poor ignorant People were amused, imposed upon, and led blindly on, even to the Brink of their own Destruction; from whence, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> the good Providence of GOD res∣cued them, yet they were so possess'd, that they flew in the Face of every Body that attempted to open their Eyes, and insulted their Deliverers.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="227"/>
It was at least a Fortnight, that the Heats of the People, on Ac∣count of these Articles, continued, before they produced any extra∣vagant Effects, and this time was generally spent in the Parliament, in reading over, discoursing upon, and preparing to Debate the Articles.</P>
<P>For it may be noted, as will appear by the Minuts, that the Ar∣ticles were read over one by one in the House, before the main read∣ing of them, and the Members were admitted to speak freely their Opinions on every Head, but to put nothing to the Vote.</P>
<P>During this Work, which was from the third of <HI>October</HI> to the <HI>first</HI> of <HI>November,</HI> the Ferment increased, and the whole Kingdom seemed to be in a Disorder, some Accounts of which may be very proper here.</P>
<P>There had always been a strong Oppoition in this Country to the present Settlement, both Ecclesiastical and Civil, and the Revo∣lution was not establish'd without a Civil War, which, tho it was but short, came to a Decisive Battel, which had this particular seeming Contradiction in it, that the Kings Army lost the Battel, and got the Victory.</P>
<P>The Viscount of <HI>Dundee,</HI> formerly <HI>Graham</HI> of <HI>Claverhouse,</HI> headed the Malecontent Party, the Kings Forces were routed, but <HI>Dundee,</HI> unhappily for his Party, was found among the Slain: His Victo∣rious Party, by his Death, not only lost the Advantage of their Victory, but having lost the Chief of their Army, they soon dispersed for want of a Head, and the present Establishment prevailed.</P>
<P>But still they left the North Highlands full of Disaffection to the present Government, never submitting, but, as it were, by meer Force, even to this Day.</P>
<P>All the Remains of this Party, called particularly the <HI>Jacobite,</HI> were unanimously against the Union, as they were against the Suc∣cesson.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Episcopal Party were against it as before, because they fore∣saw, that the Presbyterian Church would strengthen their Settlement, by the Addition of <HI>England,</HI> who by this Treaty, would on all Occasions, be obliged to support and defeud them, and so the Party would of Course be finally excluded.</P>
<P>These two Parties saw themselves abandoned by those who for∣merly opposed the Succession on different Reasons, and that those Gentlemen had fallen into the Union, as is before hinted; And tho I will not say, that they and the Papists and <HI>Jacobite</HI> Party were all in an Interest before, yet it was manifest they fell in together now, unanimously to oppose the Union.</P>
<P>What Opposition they had formerly made was under Hand, partly by Solicitation of Friends, and Clashing of Parties; they al∣ways look'd on it as a thing remote and impracticable, and a thing which the constant Jarrs, they industriously promoted among the People, and particularly the National Antipathy would always prevent.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="228"/>
But when, contrary to their Expectation, they found, That the Union was brought to a Head in <HI>England;</HI> That the Court push'd heartily to bring it to a Conclusion; and to their great Surprise found the several Opposing Parties joyn'd together; and that every one, from what different Prospects soever, concurr'd in the Union, and seem'd to make their Court to the Times on the Foot of the Zeal they should show for this new Prospect of Settlement.</P>
<P>This exceedingly alarm'd them; and they found, That now or never was the time to oppose it; That if it obtain'd now upon the Humour of the People, it was certain to be finished, and they and their Cause effectually fore-closed, from all Hopes of ever retrieving their Interest.</P>
<P>No sooner therefore was the Parliament met, and the Eyes of al the Nation fix'd upon the Event of this great Affair, but all the Engines of the several Parties were set to Work: Some to Expose, some to Defend both the Proceedings that were already perfected in <HI>England,</HI> and those that were now entring upon.</P>
<P>Innumerable Pamphlets were printed and dispers'd over the whole Kingdom; and industriously Harrangu'd upon by the Engines of the respective Parties, as their Interests led them.</P>
<P>The next Step was to find out popular Arguments to gratify the Humours of the several Orders or Divisions of the People; and to alarm them with those things in particular, which their several Tempers, Parties, or Designs led them most to apprehend.</P>
<P>Thus they spread all possible Scandals and Satyrs against the Trea∣ty in general, as well in Print as in Discourse.</P>
<P>As that it was Dishonourable to <HI>Scotland;</HI> Surrendering her Sove∣reignity and Constitution, Subjecting her to her Ancient and Im∣placable Enemies.—That it was Depressing the Honour and Dig∣nity of a Kingdom, that had Defended her Liberty against <HI>England</HI> with such Gallantry and Bravery, for so many Hundred Years, as if she was less able to Fight now than ever, her Sons less Bold, her Gentry less Daring, or less willing to Die for their Country; That now they were to be Slaves, and must run to <HI>Westminster</HI> to Vote with a Handful of Members, who would never be able to carry a Question, or to make any Weight there, but just for Forms sake sit in the House, and be laugh'd at.</P>
<P>That the Figure <HI>Scotland</HI> would make in the <HI>British</HI> Parliament, would not be like a Kingdom, but like a Province; That one County in <HI>England. viz.</HI> of <HI>Cornwall</HI> sent up as many Members, one ex∣cepted, as the whole Kingdom; and that this was an Eternal Badge of their Subjection, and the like.</P>
<P>This was a general Cry, and began to be very popular: The Peo∣ple cryed out they were <HI>Scots</HI> Men, and they would be <HI>Scots</HI> Men still; They contemn'd the Name of <HI>Britains,</HI> fit for the <HI>Welsh</HI> Men, who were made the Scoff of the <HI>English</HI> after they had reduc'd them.—<HI>Scotland</HI> had always had a Name and a Fame in Forreign Courts; They were Naturalized in <HI>France,</HI> Enjoy'd for many Years great Pri∣vileges there, and Honours bought with the Blood of their Ancestors;
<PB N="18" REF="229"/>
and they would never give away their Birthright, tho some of their Nation had been driving a Bargain for themselves, at the Price of Selling their Country.—Thus they fill'd the Mouths of the common People, who would go about the Street crying, No Union, and call the Treaters Traitors, and soon after began to threaten them openly to their Faces.</P>
<P>The Success the Party obtain'd here to incense the common People was too much, not to encourage them to proceed; And the next Step was, to infuse like Prejudices into the Heads of the several Par∣ties and Perswasions of People. And this was divided into two.
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. To perswade the Honest Presbyterian, that the Church would be subjected to the Votes, the Power and the Oppression of the Episcopal Hierarchy in <HI>England.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>I will not positively assert, that this was a meer <HI>Jacobite</HI> Chime∣ra, or had its pure Original in Plot and Design; The Fears and Ap∣prehensions of Honest People might at first lead them a great way in that Case: But I believe no Body will take Offence if I say those Fears and Apprehensions were soon made a Handle by this Party, who sat ready to take all Occasions, and they immediatly raised a Cry; That the Church was betray'd; That Episcopacy was coming in upon them; That in the <HI>British</HI> Parliament they should be subjected to the Plurality of Voices, in which the <HI>English</HI> Bishops, beside their Influence on the Nobility and Gentry, had also their own Voices: And that, if the Union ever went forward, they should be certainly suppressed by the Prelates, and reduced to a Tolleration at best, if perhaps that should be obtained.</P>
<P>I cannot be censur'd by any Body, in this Conclusion of mine, if it be remembred, what strange Advocats the Church had at this Time,—when those that never came to the Church, never owned the Jurisdiction of the Church; but on the contrary, were always known to maltreat her, reject her Establishment, and never joyned with her, either in Doctrine or Discipline, Worship or Government, went up and down, Exclaiming at the Designs of the <HI>English</HI> Bishops, to overthrow the Established Church.</P>
<P>Nor will it be remote to the purpose to observe, that when the Act for the Security of the Church came to be Debated in Parliament, those very Gentlemen appear'd Zealous to obtain larger Condi∣tions, and Voted the Overture insufficient for the Churches Safety, who were never supposed to owe the Church so much good Will or ever before were observed to make her Security any part of their Con∣cern: Nay, nor were ever known so much as to joyn with the Church, owne her Discipline, or call themselves Members.—But this ceased to be a Mystery, when some of those Gentlemen honestly de∣clared, this was only done to strengthen their Interest against the U∣nion, and openly began to draw their Arguments into a Chain of Successive Necessities; That, from the very <HI>Papist</HI> to the <HI>Jacobite,</HI> the <HI>Prelatist,</HI> the <HI>Presbyterian,</HI> the <HI>Cameronian,</HI> every one might find Reasons to Act together against the Union, as a Common and a National Evil. But of this I shall find Occasion to speak again presently.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="230"/>
The early spreading these Prejudices had but too much Success; the Party applyed themselves, as they found it suit the <HI>Genius</HI> and Tempers of the People.</P>
<P>To some it was Fatal to the Church, and they would be subject∣ed to Prelacy, and the Plurality of Votes in the <HI>British</HI> Parliament.</P>
<P>To others it was Dangerous to the State, and the Independency, Honour and Sovereignity of the Kingdom was betray'd and given up.</P>
<P>Nay to the very Children and most ignorant People, they had their Arguments; such as, That the Honours, as they call them, the Crown of <HI>Scotland,</HI> Sword and Scepter, should be carryed away to <HI>England;</HI> And the Boys and Mob were invited by a great Person, in a Melancholly Tone, to go in and see the Ancient Crown of <HI>Scotland,</HI> for that it would soon be carryed away, and they might never see it any more.</P>
<P>To others they had a more subtil Argument; which tho it was perhaps begun among those that had no ill in their Design, <HI>as is said of the first,</HI> yet they carefully improved this, as they did all other things, to the general Confusion of the Times: And this was a Notion, that it was absolutely against the National Cove∣nant, in which the People had Sworn to two Things, which this Treaty directly would contraveen and render impossible.<LIST>
<ITEM>1<HI>st,</HI>—That <HI>Scotland</HI> had Sworn in the National Covenant, to support the Sovereignity of the Kingdom, which they said was now to be given up.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That <HI>Scotland</HI> had engaged to pull down Episcopacy in <HI>England,</HI> to the utmost of their Power.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The starting these two things had two fatal Prospects; which indeed, had they not been both over-ruled by that Secret Hand, which had singularly appeared in the carrying this Treaty on thro' so many seemingly insuperable Difficulties, might have involved both Nations in Confusion.</P>
<P>From the first of these, they pretended to be bound to preserve the State in its immediate separate Condition; as if Confederating with, and Joyning to a more powerful Nation, on Terms Honourable, and tending to support the Sovereignity and Power of the whole, was not consisting with that part of the Covenant; which could no otherwise be understood there, than to signify the Supporting and Defending the Constitution of <HI>Scotland,</HI> as it was or should be legal∣ly Establish'd.</P>
<P>As to the other Suggestion, it was effectually Answer'd by one of the most Learned Divines of the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> Doctor <HI>Rule;</HI> where he Explains the Meaning of the Covenant to be in that Case, no Attempt by Force to reduce the Church of <HI>England, &amp;c.</HI> but <HI>what we are bound to by</HI> the Covenant, <HI>is not to Reform them, but to Concur with them, when lawfully called, to Advance Reformation either there, or any where else: And it is far from our Thoughts to go beyond that Boundary,</HI> Vindication of the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> Pag. 16.</P>
<P>But this Clamour had another Effect, which might have been as Fatal in its Consequence, had not the Scene of Affairs been very
<PB N="20" REF="231"/>
much changed in <HI>England:</HI> For this very Pretence, which the E∣piscopal Party prompted as much as in them lay here, and drew a∣bundance of Good and Well meaning People into, in <HI>Scotland,</HI> as an Objection against the Union, they immediately turned upon them in <HI>England,</HI> and set some of the Church of <HI>England</HI> Clergy, espe∣cially those warm Gentlemen who were against the Union; They set them, <HI>I say,</HI> upon raising of the old Alarm again, of the Danger of the Church, arising from the Union; even from this very Argument, that the Presbyterians in <HI>Scotland</HI> were Sworn by the Covenant, to do their utmost to pull down Episcopacy in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>I shall, as little as possible, concern this History with Debates of any of our Party Quarrels; but the Contradiction which these Peo∣ple fell into, was remarkable; and could it have been considered, might have very much Exposed them.</P>
<P>For if it was true, that the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> had Sworn to De∣throne Episcopacy; and that the Presbyterians were against the Uni∣on, because it would deprive them of that Power, and for ever ty their Hands from that Work,—Then they were but ill Friends to the Church of <HI>England</HI> among her own Clergy, who were for that Reason against the Union.—And it was an Argument of the strongest Nature to prove, that the Church of <HI>England</HI> should have been with all her Heart for the Union, if she had the least Know∣ledge of her own Interest.</P>
<P>It is plain from Doctor <HI>Rule,</HI> that the Obligation of the Cove∣nant extended no further, than to oblige them to concur with <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> when lawfully called to a General Reformation.</P>
<P>But the Party in <HI>England</HI> run these things a great deal higher, and plyed the warm Addresses of the People; and especially one of the <HI>Cameronians,</HI> and of their Leader Mr. <HI>John Hepburn,</HI> against the Uni∣on; calling what those weak People put into their Addresses, the Act and Deed of the whole Presbyterian Church of <HI>Scotland:</HI> When 'tis known, <HI>First,</HI> That Mr. <HI>Hepburn</HI>'s Address had but seven Hands to it. 2. Those People, tho in other things many of them are good People, yet do neither owne the Church nor the State; neither the Civil Government nor the Ecclesiastick. Of which I shall be larger hereafter.</P>
<P>By these Artifices 'tis hardly credible, what Aversions they raised in the People against the Union in general, even before the Articles were made publick, or at all Debated in the House.</P>
<P>But when the Articles were printed, and every one began to read Lectures upon them, according as their several Fancies guided them, or their Interest seem'd to clash with them, I want Words to express what a Clamour was raised on all Hands, and what Feuds began to appear in every Corner of the Nation.</P>
<P>Parties and People, whose Interests and Principles differed as much as Light and Darkness; who were as contrary in Opinion, and as far asunder in every thing, as the <HI>Poles,</HI> seemed to draw together here.—'Twas the most monstrous Sight in the World, to see the <HI>Jacobite</HI> and the <HI>Presbyterian,</HI> the persecuting Prelatic <HI>Non-juror</HI> and

the <HI>Cameronian,</HI> the <HI>Papist</HI> and the Reformed <HI>Protestant,</HI> Parle toge∣ther, Joyn Interest, and Concert Measures together.</P>
<P>To see the <HI>Jacobites</HI> at <HI>Glasgow</HI> Huzzaing the Mob, and Encou∣raging them to have a Care of the Church; The High-flying Epis∣copal Dissenter crying out, the Overture was not a sufficient Securi∣ty for the Church.</P>
<P>Such Convulsions as these Agitated the whole Kingdom; And it was the Unaccountablest Thing that ever was known, to find a Nation, That, but a few Months before, were earnestly crying out for an Union, and the nearer the better; and that were fully con∣vinc'd of the Necessity they had of this Union, now fly in the Face of their Masters, and upbraid the Gentlemen, who managed it, with Selling and Betraying their Country, and Surrendering their Constitution, Sovereignity and Independency to the <HI>English.</HI></P>
<P>And such was the Clamour against the Treaters, that I verily be∣lieve, and I assure you, I do not give my private Opinion in it,—had the Articles of the Treaty been published before the Treaters came home; and the Feuds been the same against them as were af∣terwards, there was not many of them would dared to have gone home, without a Guard to protect them.</P>
<P>The Merchants, the Burghs, the Country People, all cryed out of Oppression, and of Ruine and Destruction in Trade.—And yet, the Amendments that were offered by that Party to the Articles, in the Time of their Debate, were so small and so trifling, tho they had a free Debate on every Head, that their own Friends cry∣ed out upon them, for demanding so little; and used this as an Ar∣gument against them afterwards, that they might have had more, if they had asked it.</P>
<P>Nor is it to be forgotten, that those very Gentlemen, who raised most Noise at the General of the Treaty, had least to say to the Particulars; had fewest Objections to make, and least of all con∣cern'd themselves in the Amendments.—The Reason was plain, the Design was not to Amend the Treaty, but to Destroy it; They were not Sollicitous to have a good Treaty, but to have no Treaty; The Drift was to Confound it with Infinite Objections, and to Cla∣mour the People out of their Wits, that they might, if possible, Clamour the Parliament out of the House: And of this, such evi∣dent Proofs will appear in the Process of this Story, as no Body, I believe, will make any Doubt, but that there is Reason for such an Objection.</P>
<P>The Parliament was now met, and the Party who opposed the Treaty diligently, made up their greatest Strength within Doors in order to it.—I will not say, that several took the Oath of Par∣liament, on purpose to be able to do Service against it, who never took the said Oath before,—but I know it was so understood of several Gentlemen,—and they were reported to be advised by their Friends to do so.</P>
<P>The first Step they took without Doors, <HI>for the Matters within Door, I refer to the Abstract I shall make of the Minuts in the end of</HI>
<PB N="22" REF="233"/>
<HI>this Work:</HI> But the first Step they took without Doors, as to Par∣ticulars, was to set on Foot a Notion, that the Members of Parlia∣ment had <HI>no Right to</HI> alter the Constitution, without the particular Consent of their <HI>Constituents;</HI> And that therefore the Parliament ought to have an Adjournment for some time, that the Members might go down into the several and respective Countries, which they Represented, and know the Mind of their Constituents.</P>
<P>And tho, this seem'd to be many ways confuted by Strength of Ar∣gument; wherein it was alledged, that this was not an Altering or Giving up the Constitution; And therefore, suppose it were true, that the Members were not impowered to Act, without the Consent of their Constituents, in Giving up the Constitution, yet this did not reach here.</P>
<P N="2">2. It was alledged, that this Parliament was Summoned by Her Majesty, with an express Signification in the Proclamation, that it was to Treat of, Consult about, and Conclude an Union with <HI>Eng∣land;</HI> And being sent up, for that declared purpose, by their Con∣stituents, there remain'd no Occasion to demand any further, or other Instructions from them; but they became Plenipotentiaries from that particular Circumstance.</P>
<P N="3">3. That, by the Constitution, it was not required, that the Con∣stituents should be consulted on any such Occasion; That the Con∣vention of Estates Transposed the Crown, Altered the Succession, and Settled the Revolution; which, in all Circumstances, was as Essential to the Constitution as this; and that they never Consult∣ed their Constituents in that Case at all; nor did the Opposers of the Revolution demand it; but Protested, and went out of the House.</P>
<P>And, in this Case, their Champion Mr. <HI>Hodges</HI> also was against them, who owned, that their Commissioners to the Parliament had full Power to Act for them in this Case.</P>
<P><HI>However,</HI> As things began to run very high, and the People, prompted by these Popular Arguments, Assum'd every thing they thought fit to call their Right; several Burghs wrote Letters to their Representatives, in their own Names, and by their own Authori∣ties, Requiring them not to give their Votes, or Assents to an In∣corporating Union;—<HI>Or, in short,</HI> not to the Union as now coming on, in the Terms of the Treaty.</P>
<P><HI>But this was not all;</HI> For, finding that this was not much regard∣ded by the Members; and that Precedents in like Cases, would not support the Practice; They turn'd their private Letters into Pub∣lick Addresses, and those introduc'd Mobs, Tumults, Insultings of Magistrates, Flight of Gentlemen from their Houses, and all man∣ner of Popular Disorders; Till, at last, it came to downright In∣surrection and Rebellion: Which, had not Circumstances, and the Season particularly prevented, had risen up to Blood, Civil War, and all the Terrible Consequences of an Inrag'd and Divided Nati∣on, as shall more at large be related in its Course.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="234"/>
But to return to the Party who opposed the Treaty; at first they strove to carry on their Opposition by wiser Methods; and, by their Force of Arguments, to possess the Peoples Minds with such Aver∣sions, as might convince the Parliament, they were Acting against the general Current of the Nation.</P>
<P>And having not at <HI>first</HI> appear'd against the thing in general, it behoved them to descend to particular Objections; For, to say, they would have no Union at all, would have been Impolitick, and have formed too great a Party against them: It was necessary therefore, to form themselves into a Body of Objectors, that had some Reason on their Side, and could descend to Particulars to en∣force their Opinion.</P>
<P>Nor could they, in good Manners to the Queen, object against an Union in general, who, in Her Letters to the Parliament, had so earnestly recommended, upon all Occasions, the Union of Her People, as what Her Majesty esteem'd so much for their mutual Good; That she would count it Her singular Happiness, to have it compleated in Her Reign: On this Score, I say, should they have rejected all manner of Union, or Treaty of Union, it would have been so directly flying in the Face of the Queens Recommendation, that it would have not only appeared rude, but have lost them a considerable Party, whose Assistance they found very great Occasion for.</P>
<P>This brought all the several Parties, who were against the Treaty, as well those that were against it, on the Account of the Succession, as those that were against it in general, to fall in with those, who on∣ly objected against the Circumstances of it; <HI>I mean,</HI> the Conditions, and Stipulations published in the Articles.</P>
<P>Thus the great Variety of Objectors, to make themselves perfect∣ly Formidable, however different in Notion or Design, made up one Body; and turn'd their Arguments from being pointed against the Union in general, to be pointed against the Terms of it, <HI>An Incorporating Ʋnion.</HI></P>
<P>This brought them back to the several Schemes of Forreign Uni∣ons of Nations, such as <HI>Switzerland,</HI> the <HI>Ʋnited Provinces,</HI> and the like: And some proposed one thing, some another, not foreseeing, that, had even any of their Proposals come to have been the real Treaty; yet this Party, who were against the Union <HI>as such,</HI> would have been as much against that, as they were against this; and so at last they must have divided, broke their Interest, and lost the whole, which was the main thing aim'd at.</P>
<P>And thus now stood the Debate.—<HI>No Incorporating Ʋnion</HI> was the Word,<HI>—Let us have an Ʋnion with</HI> England <HI>with all our Hearts,—but no Incorporation; Let us keep our Parliament, keep our Sovereignity,</HI> keep <HI>our Independency,</HI> keep <HI>our Constitution,</HI> and for all the rest, <HI>we are ready to Ʋnite with you, as firmly as you can De∣vise.</HI></P>
<P>This was thought, by most, to be just reviving the former Notions of a Federal Union,—with so many inconsistent Noun-Substan∣tives
<PB N="24" REF="235"/>
in their Government, that had upon all Occasions been found Impracticable; and which would so intirely have left both Na∣tions Exposed to the Possibility of a Relapsing into a divided Con∣dition, that it could not be expected, <HI>England, whose Considerations for Ʋniting, were Peace, Strength, and shutting a back Door of conti∣nual War, and Confusion from the North,</HI> should communicate Trade, Freedom of Customs in all her Ports, and Plantations, with the Egress and Regress of Manufactures, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and leave the main things yet precarious and uncertain.</P>
<P>It would be endless to trouble the Reader here with the Argu∣ments on both sides,—which came resolved at last to this short Head.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the Treaty at <HI>London,</HI> the <HI>English</HI> Commis∣sioners had refused to Treat, but upon an intire and Incorporating Union,—and had given such Reasons, why all other Propo∣sals, would not only be insufficient, but impracticable; That the <HI>Scots</HI> Commissioners were convinc'd of it, and satisfyed to enter up∣on a Treaty of an intire Union, as the only way to establish the lasting Peace and Prosperity of both Nations.</P>
<P>To talk then of a Federal Union at this time, seem'd only to put the Question, whether the Parliament should take the Articles into Consideration, or no.—And this run all the Opposers back to the Schemes of those, that were against the Union in general, and by this they lost Ground; For tho they made a strong Opposition against the very Reading the Articles at all, and would gladly have rejected them in the Gross; yet <HI>there</HI> several of their Friends left them, and so they lost the first Question, <HI>Whether the Articles should be read,</HI> which was carryed in the Affirmative <HI>October</HI> 3<HI>d,</HI> the first Day of the Meeting of the Parliament, as will appear by the Mi∣nutes.</P>
<P>This was the first Strait they were brought to; And therefore, to back these two Principles, they set to Work to procure a Throng of Addresses from the several Towns,—and which 'tis visible they attempted to back with Force, to awe the Parliament into a Com∣plyance, as will hereafter appear.</P>
<P>Most of these Addresses were worded to the same purpose, and in Substance contain'd a Claim of the Constituents Right, to limit and instruct their Commissioners,—and a Direction to avoid an Incorporating Union; Some of them were decently prefac'd with Expressions of Courtesy to <HI>England,</HI> and Willingness to Confede∣rate, or Unite with them on other Terms; but Protested against an Incorporation of Government, as contrary to their Liberties, and destructive to their Sovereignity and Independency, the Glory of their Ancestors, the Honour of the Ancient Kingdom, and a great many such plausible Allegations, in order to make the Ground of their Addressing seem the more Specious, and to please the People: Others less Courteous, spoke higher Words and rougher Language, talk'd of their Defending their Constitution against the Invasion of Strangers, reflected on their Treaters, and their being wheedled and
<PB N="25" REF="236"/>
drawn in to give up their Country, their Liberties, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> We shall come to them presently.</P>
<P>As the Parliament was now sitting, so was the Commission,—this is a Deputation from the General Assembly, being a certain Number of Ministers, Impowered by an Act of the Assembly, to meet in the Intervals of their Session, to take Care of the Affairs of the Church.</P>
<P>The Transactions within the Parliament, I refer to the Abstract of the Minutes, with Observations immediately following this Ac∣count. <HI>Folio</HI> {left blank} But that this Account, which contains things done without Doors, may run Hand in Hand with the said Abstract, it is necessary to give an Account what was Transacting in the Commission at the same time, at least so far as it relates to the present Affair.</P>
<P>It is observ'd in the Minutes of the 12<HI>th</HI> of <HI>October,</HI> that a Moti∣on was made in Parliament for a Publick Fast; which, however, was opposed by those, that some thought, had more Inclination to the Work of a Publick Fast, than those that proposed it; How∣ever, as the Commission had been several days met, the Gentlemen in Parliament, who were against the having a Publick Fast appoint∣ed by Parliament, seemed to refer it to the Commission.</P>
<P>It was indeed opposed in the Commission of the Assembly, for the same Reasons that it was in Parliament, <HI>viz.</HI> Not for any Dislike of Fasting and Praying, but to prevent the Alarming and Amusing the People, which was the principal Work on Foot at that Time; However, not to neglect the Work, or be found op∣posing such a thing, as Praying to GOD, on whatsoever Account; It was moved in the Commission, That they should set apart a Time for themselves to Fast and Pray, as Ministers assembled on so great an Occasion;) and that a Circular Letter should be sent to the several Presbyteries, to do the same in their several Districts.</P>
<P>The Act of the Commission, for this Day of Prayer, neither Con∣fin'd them to a Day, or prescrib'd the Manner;) The Act it self is to be found in the <HI>Appendix, N A x,</HI> as Copied from the Original in the Register.</P>
<P>There had been strong Rumours spread abroad, That the Com∣mission would not Act, <HI>in this Case,</HI> without the General Assembly; but that they should Protest against the Union's being Concluded, till a General Assembly was Called; and Address the Parliament to Adjourn the Debate of it, till the Assembly should meet, which was not to be till <HI>April.</HI>—Or, that the Lords of Her Majesties Council should procure from Her Majesty, that the Assembly might be Cal∣led sooner.</P>
<P>But, as this was the Contrivance of a Party, only to gain Time; and of a piece with the Delays offered at in the House, at the same time; so it met with no Incouragement in the Commission: Not, but that there was too strong a Party willing to have Befriended it, at that time, even in the Commission it self.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="237"/>
<HI>However,</HI> a very Moderate and well Temper'd Address was drawn up in the Commission; it was Agreed to in the Commission the 11<HI>th,</HI> but not presented till the 17<HI>th:</HI> In which, they recommend to the Parliament, the Security of the Presbyterian Church of <HI>Scot∣land,</HI> and its Doctrine, Discipline, Worship and Government, to be secured by the Treaty, as you may see by the Address it self, which is printed in the <HI>Appendix, N B x.</HI></P>
<P>After this, the Commission was again pressed about the Fast; and more Ministers being come to Town, than were at the first; and coming with the Sense of the Country People fresh in their Minds, who were, by this time, every where rendered very uneasy, the Motion of a Fast was renewed; And tho some were against a Fast as National, yet, as no Body was against Praying to GOD, on so Solemn Occasion, so the Commission began with themselves as follows.</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> 17<HI>th,</HI> It was Agreed, That the Members of the Com∣mission, with such as pleased to joyn with them, should Con∣veen in the High Church of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> for <HI>Prayer</HI> the Day fol∣lowing; That the Moderator should begin with a short Discourse from the Pulpit, concerning the Occasion and Reason of that Meeting, and the Ministers to Pray, and the Orders of the Ex∣ercise were settled by the Commission.</P>
<P>Accordingly, on the 18<HI>th,</HI> there was a very great Congrega∣tion, where was present many Members of Parliament, and the Work continued till two of the Clock, very Publick and Solemn; but without any of the Excesses, which some People flattered themselves to find there.</P>
<P><HI>However,</HI> after this, the Motion for a Fast was brought on a∣gain, and carryed in the Commission on the 21<HI>st</HI> of <HI>October,</HI> as from the Register follows.</P>
<P>There having formerly been a Motion made, for Application to the Parliament for a Publick National Fast; The Matter was this Day resumed, and much Debate about it; The Commis∣sion being pretty full, it took longer time; Some were for Ap∣plying to the Parliament, for their Civil Sanction to it; Others, that Presbyteries should be wrote to, to Appoint a Fast, without Applying to the Parliament; because it was feared, the Parlia∣ment might not be Unanimous in that Matter; and the men∣tioning of a Fast there, might, perhaps, in the present Circumstances, be Occasion of Strife: And after long Deliberation, it was Unani∣mously Agreed unto, that Application should not be made to the Parliament; and a Committee was Named to bring in a Draught of the Paper about that Fast; which Committee brought in the same, in Form of an Act, upon the 22<HI>d</HI> of <HI>October;</HI> and af∣ter some few Amendments, the same was Unanimously Approven.</P>
<P>This Fast was observed in <HI>Edinburgh</HI> very Solemnly, His Grace Her Majesties Commissioner, the Lord Chancellor, the Great Officers of State, and many Members of Parliament appear'd at Church, and joyn'd in it, tho the Appointment had not the Sancti∣on
<PB N="27" REF="238"/>
of the Civil Authority to support it.—A clear Proof, by the way, of the Parliaments owning the Power of Appointing Fasts, to be in the Church.</P>
<P>Yet was not this such a General National Fast, as some people de∣sired; hoping to obtain upon the People, by the Solemnity of the Thing; and by the Warmth of the Ministers, who, they vain∣ly expected, would, in the Pulpit, run out against the Treaty; Bring the People to a general Aversion against it; and, by Consequence, to some violent Measures for preventing it.</P>
<P>But the Prudence of the Ministers prevented all this designed Mis∣chief;—and tho the Day was, as I have said, observ'd with great Solemnity, and Affection; yet it was to their great Disappoint∣ment, that the Ministers generally, <HI>as well those who were against the Ʋnion,</HI> as those <HI>who were for it,</HI> in their respective Parishes, applyed themselves only summarily to the Substance, nay, to the very Words of the Assemblies Act, <HI>viz. That all the Determinations of the E∣states of Parliament, with respect to an Ʋnion with</HI> England, <HI>might be Influenced and Directed by Divine Wisdom, to the Glory of GOD, the Good of Religion, and particularly of the Church of</HI> Scotland.</P>
<P>Thus the Thing was carryed thro', except as hereafter, without the Mischievous Effect, which some expected from it; who now begun to turn their Expectations another way, <HI>viz.</HI> To <HI>THE PEOPLE,</HI> who, they had, by various Arts, screw'd up to an Un∣expected Fermentation; as, in the ensuing Tumults, appear'd.</P>
<P>I am sorry, that, in the Process of this Story, especially in this, which I count the fowlest and blackest part of it that could have been Acted, I shall be obliged to mention some Persons of great Ho∣nour, and Ancient Families; who were pleased, for Reasons of their own, to Act against the Union, and to appear so publickly in the Opposition of it, that <HI>the People,</HI> I do not say, by their own Appro∣bation, <HI>I hope not,</HI> singled them out as the Patriots of their Country against this Transaction; and, by their Shouts and Huzzas after them, as they went and came to and from the Parliament, made them, as it were, the Heads of the Party, who opposed the Union.</P>
<P>The Dukes of <HI>Hamilton</HI> and <HI>Athole</HI> were the Chief of these, and were almost every day in Parliament, strenuously Arguing against the Articles, and pressing for other Measures, as by the Observations on the Minutes will appear.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Hamilton</HI> being Indisposed by some Lameness, I cannot describe the Occasion, was generally carryed to and from the House in his Chair.</P>
<P>The common People now screw'd up to a Pitch, and Ripe for the Mischief designed, and prompted by the particular Agents of a wick∣ed Party, began to be very Insolent: It had been whispered about several Days, that the Rabble would rise, and come up to the Parliament House, and cry out, <HI>No Ʋnion;</HI> That they would take a∣way the Honours, <HI>as they call them, viz.</HI> The Crown, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and carry them to the Castle, and a long Variety of Foolish Reports of this kind.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="239"/>
But the first Appearance of any thing Mobish was, that every day, when the Duke went up, but principally as he came down in his Chair from the House, the Mob follow'd him, shouting and crying out, GOD bless his Grace, for standing up against the Uni∣on, and appearing for his Country, and the like.</P>
<P>And as Extremes are generally accompanyed with their Contra∣ries; so, while his Grace the Duke of <HI>Hamilton</HI> had these fancied Honours paid him, the Queens Representative, the High Commis∣sioner, had all the Insults, Reproaches and Indignities offered him, that they durst, for fear of publick Justice, shew him. As will by and by appear.</P>
<P>Far be it from me to say, the Duke of <HI>Hamilton</HI> desired or encou∣raged this Tumultuary kind of Congratulation; That sort of Popula∣rity must be too much below a Person of his Character; and his Grace knows the World too well, and is too Wise a Man, not to know, that such things always tend to Confusion, and to the De∣struction of Civil Peace in the World.</P>
<P>Nor do I doubt, but his Grace did what he could, to prevent their singling him out, to show their Mob Courtesie to; but there was no Crushing a Rabble, that had so many Wheels to set it in Motion; and the seeming Causes of which encreased every day, <HI>as the Ʋnion began to draw forward,</HI> and as the Members appeared resolved to go forward with it seriously, in order to a Conclusion.</P>
<P>On the 22<HI>d</HI> of <HI>October,</HI> they follow'd the Dukes Chair quite thro' the City down to the Abbey Gate; The Guards prevented their go∣ing further; But all the way as they came back, they were heard to threaten what they would do the next day; That then they would be a thousand times as many; That they would pull the Traitors, <HI>so they call'd the Treaters of the Ʋnion at</HI> London, out of their Hou∣ses, and they would soon put an end to the Union.</P>
<P>On the 23<HI>d,</HI> they made part of their Words good indeed; For, as the Parliament sat something late, the People gather'd in the Streets, and about the Doors of the Parliament House, and particularly the Par∣liament Closs was almost full, that the Members could not go in or out without Difficulty; when Duke <HI>Hamilton</HI> coming out of the House, the Mob Huzza'd as formerly, and follow'd his Chair in a very great Number; The Duke, instead of going down to <HI>the Abbey</HI> as usual, went up the High-Street to the <HI>Land-Market,</HI> as they call it, and so to the Lodgings of the Duke of <HI>Athole;</HI> Some said, he went to avoid the Mob; Others maliciously said, he went to point them to their Work.</P>
<P>While he went in to the Duke of <HI>Athole</HI>'s Lodgings, the Rabble at∣tended at the Door; and, by Shouting and Noise, having increas∣ed their Numbers to several thousands, they began with Sir <HI>Patrick Johnston,</HI> who was one of the Treaters, and the Year before had been Lord Provost; First they assaulted his Lodgings with Stones and Sticks, <HI>and Curses not a few;</HI> but his Windows being too high, they came up the Stairs to his Door, and fell to Work at it with Sledges, or great Hammers; And, had they broke it open in their first Fury,
<PB N="29" REF="240"/>
he had, without doubt, been Torn in Pieces without Mercy; and thus only, because he was a Treater in the Commission to <HI>England;</HI> For, before that, no Man was so well Belov'd, as he, over the whole City.</P>
<P>His Lady, in the utmost Despair with this Fright, comes to the Window, with two Candles in her Hand, that she might be known; and cryed out, <HI>for GODs Sake,</HI> to call the Guards: An Honest Apothecary in the Town, who knew her Voice, and saw the Di∣stress she was in, and to whom the Family, under GOD, is obliged, for their Deliverance, ran immediately down to the Town Guard; but they would not stir, without the Lord Provosts Order;—but that being soon obtain'd, one Captain <HI>Richardson,</HI> who Command∣ed, taking about thirty Men with him, March'd bravely up to them; and making his way with great Resolution thro' the Croud, they Flying, but Throwing Stones, and Hallowing at him, and his Men, he Seized the Foot of the Stair Case; and then boldly went up, clear'd the Stair, and took six of the Rabble in the very Act; and so delivered the Gentleman and his Family.—</P>
<P>But this did not put a Stop to the general Tumult, tho it deliver∣ed this particular Family; For the Rabble, by this time, were prodigiously increased, and went Roving up and down the Town, Breaking the Windows of the Members of Parliament, and Insult∣ing them in their Coaches, in the Streets; They put out all the Lights, that they might not be discovered; and the Author of this had one great Stone thrown at him, for but looking out of a Window; for they suffered no Body to look out, especially with any Lights, lest they should know Faces, and Inform against them afterwards.</P>
<P>By this time, it was about eight or nine a Clock at Night, and now they were absolute Masters of the City; and it was Reported, they were going to shut up all the Ports;—The Lord Commissioner being Inform'd of that, sent a Party of the Foot Guards, and took Possession of the <HI>Nether-Bow,</HI> which is a Gate in the Middle of the High-Street, as <HI>Temple-Bar</HI> between the City of <HI>London</HI> and the Court.</P>
<P>The City was now in a Terrible Fright, and every Body was under Concern for their Friends; The Rabble went Raving about the Streets till Midnight, frequently Beating Drums, and rai∣sing more People; when my Lord Commissioner being Inform'd, there were a Thousand of the Seamen and Rabble come up from <HI>Leith;</HI> and Apprehending, if it were suffered to go on, it might come to a Dangerous Head, and be out of his Power to suppress,—he sent for the Lord Provost, and Demanded, that the Guards should March into the City.</P>
<P>The Lord Provost, after some Difficulty, yielded; tho it was alledg∣ed, that it was what was never known in <HI>Edinburgh</HI> before—About one a Clock in the Morning, a Battallion of the Guards entred the Town, Marched up to the Parliament Closs, and took Post in all
<PB N="30" REF="241"/>
the Avenues of the City, which prevented the Resolutions taken to Insult the Houses of the rest of the Treaters.</P>
<P>The Rabble were intirely reduc'd by this, and gradually dispers'd, and so the Tumult ended.</P>
<P>It is not easy to describe here, the Consternation all Good Peo∣ple were in, at the Rising of this Tumult; and had not such Re∣solutions been at last taken, as is above-mentioned, <HI>which the other Party did not expect,</HI> it had been the fatalest Rabble the Nation had ever seen.</P>
<P>In this Case my Lord Commissioner greatly disappointed the Par∣ty, who, having Insulted his Graces Lenity before, as a Faintness of Resolution, had spread about Scandalous Reports, That the Government durst not look the Rabble in the Face; That the High Commissioner was afraid of being Rabbled in his Palace; and that, if they once rose in a Mob, all would fly before them; That the Parliament would run away, and dissolve themselves, or fly to the Castle; and another worse thing than all, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Souldiers were on their side, and would not fight against their Country, as they called it.</P>
<P>But the Resolution of the Lord Commissioner disappointed them all, who now shew'd them, he had as much cheerful Bravery in the Action, as he had Calmness and Temper in the Parliament; This broke all their Measures; and when they saw the Guards, led by Brave and Faithful Officers, stand firm to their Duty, and shew themselves resolutely forward to defend the Government, they lost all their Courage; it defeated all their Expectations, and they began to lay aside that sort of violent Proceedings, and apply themselves to the Artifice of Words, and the Managry of Parties in the House.</P>
<P>It is to be observed also, That this Rabble was a Mine sprung before its Time, which blew backwards, and destroyed the Engi∣neers, rather than the Enemies; <HI>The Plot</HI> being otherwise laid, <HI>viz.</HI> That it should not have broken out, till some Days following; when, as was said, all would have been in readiness, to have fini∣shed the Work at one Blow, <HI>viz.</HI> To have blown up the Govern∣ment at once.</P>
<P>They had been Tampering with the Souldiery, in order to De∣bauch them from their Duty; and some People talk'd of retiring from the Parliament, and of some Great Men Heading the People; which, had their Patience been more, and their Conduct a little more secret, they had, without Doubt, effectually brought it to pass; But they blew their own Project up by their Precipitation, and so saved their Country by their very Attempt to destroy it.</P>
<P>The Author of this had his Share of the Danger in this Tumult, and tho unknown to him, was watch'd and set by the Mob, in or∣der to know where to find him, had his Chamber Windows In∣sulted, and the Windows below him broken by Mistake.—But, by the Prudence of his Friends, the Shortness of its Continuance, and GODs Providence, he escaped.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="242"/>
Several of the Rabble were seized upon, and apprehended; and there was a Discourse of making Examples of some of them; but the Mercy of the High Commissioner, <HI>however provoked and abused,</HI> prevail'd to Compassionate, rather than Punish their Follies; They were only kept some time in Prison, and afterwards let go, without any other Punishment.</P>
<P>And thus ended the most dangerous Juncture of the whole Trea∣ty, and a Tumult, which ended to the Advantage of the Govern∣ment, and the Disheartning the Party, who, before that, carryed it with such an unheard of Insolence; That, had they not been, as they thought, sure of their Cause, they would never have An∣swer'd it to their own Discretion, to have Acted in so Open and Insulting a Manner.</P>
<P>The Foot Guards, and two other Regiments of Foot, did now constant Duty in the City, <HI>viz.</HI> The Regiments of <HI>Strathnaver</HI> and <HI>Grant;</HI> The Horse Guards attended the Commissioner, the other Battallion of Guards at the Palace, and the Garison at the Castle.</P>
<P>And all was little enough; For the Regiments were thin, and few; and all the Forces then in the Kingdom, <HI>some Independent Companies in the Highlands excepted,</HI> did not exceed three thousand Men; and great Endeavours were used, as I have said, to De∣bauch the Souldiers, tho in vain; they appearing Faithful and Forward, to do their Duty on all Occasions.</P>
<P>The next day the Parliament did not sit; but a great Council was assembled, where the Measures the Lord Commissioner had taken, as to bringing the Guards into the City, was Ratified and Approv∣ed; and a Proclamation published for suppressing the Rabble; which being something particular, is inserted in the <HI>Appendix, N<SUP>o</SUP>. C x.</HI></P>
<P>I have printed this Proclamation, tho this Work could very ill spare Room for it; both because it recites the Acts of Parliament in <HI>Scotland</HI> in Force against Rabbles; as also, for that the Method is particular to that place, and very good to prevent Tumults, <HI>viz.</HI> 1. Of obliging the Deacons of Crafts, <HI>that is, as in</HI> London, <HI>the Masters of Companies,</HI> to Summon the Inhabitants, and make them give Security for the Behaviour of their Servants, Apprentices, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> 2. Giving an Indemnity to the Souldiers, either of the Regiments, or Town-Guards, in case they should wound or kill any Person, af∣ter a Command given for all to retire from the Streets.—</P>
<P>Indeed there was Occasion enough for such a Proclamation; and, had not the Party been broken, <HI>as before,</HI> all would have been little enough, to have suppress'd the Fury of this Enraged Multitude.</P>
<P>No Body would undertake to justify the Rabble, <HI>especially after they had been defeated in the Design.</HI>—Every Body cryed out, it was a Dangerous Thing; and the whole City might have been ex∣posed to Plunder, Riot, and all manner of Disorder.</P>
<P>But, as the Party could not justify the Rabble, so they began a new Clamour; and now they exclaim'd, That the Privileges of
<PB N="32" REF="243"/>
the City of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> were invaded, and Souldiers brought in, to awe and oppress the Inhabitants.</P>
<P>That this had not been done in sixty Years before, nor ever, but in the Time of War and Tyrannick Government; and that it was a Fore-runner of the Slavery of the Nation.</P>
<P>Then they cryed out, this was an Invasion of the Freedoms of Parliament, and an Awe upon the Members, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> See the Minuts of the 25<HI>th</HI> of <HI>October,</HI> where that Matter was urged very warmly.</P>
<P>'Tis true, it had been to be wished, the Affair could have been carryed on, without any Jealousies and Insults; But, on the other side, it was alledged, That the Force put on the Government by the Rabble, was an Invasion of the Publick Peace; and that the Mob were the Aggressors, and the Parliament was much more likely to be Awed by the Ungovern'd Rabbles of the Streets, if they had gotten a Head, than by the Forces brought in for their Security; who being at their Command, did nothing but secure them from the Insults of the Mob, and keep that Peace which the Civil Authority had not Power to preserve.</P>
<P>That the Military Power is always supposed to be assisting to the Civil, when opprest by Rabbles and Tumults; and while in Sub∣servience to the Civil Peace, and Subordinate to the Civil Powers, the proper Safe-Guard of a State;—and as the Force of these Ar∣guments carryed all things before them in the House, all the legal Pretences were overthrown, by the Reason and Nature of the Thing, and the Parliament approved of all that had been done.</P>
<P>Nor did they Approve it only; but Ordered the Guards to be Continued, or recommended it to the Lord High Commissioner, and the Privy Council, to continue their Care for the Safety and Security of the Parliament. <HI>Vide the Minuts of October</HI> 25<HI>th.</HI></P>
<P>However, by this Method, the Appearance of the Rabbles, and the Fury of the Streets, were, in some Measure, Abated; yet the People appeared Exasperated to the last Degree; The Huzzaing and Crouding about Duke <HI>Hamilton</HI> continued, notwithstanding all his Endeavours to prevent it; and unusual Threatnings and dark Speeches were heard among the People.</P>
<P>The Lords, and others, who opposed the placing Guards in the Streets, made Protests against it, as Infringing the Liberties of the Parliament; tho it was very plain, that there was nothing Imposed in Parliament, nothing offered to be Carryed, but by Reasoning and fair Voting.</P>
<P>From this Time, they began to talk of Country Tumults; and that, since the Commissioner had suppress'd the Mob in the Town, the whole Country should rise, and come up to <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and remove the Guards by Force from Imprisoning the Parliament.</P>
<P>The Pretence was Specious; They pretended, the Guards were a Force upon the Members of Parliament; That this was Craming the Union down their Throats; That the Country was Unanimous∣ly against it, and would not bear, that a few People in the House, because they had the Majority within Doors, and a Band of Souldi∣ers
<PB N="33" REF="244"/>
to back them, should Impose a Conjunction with <HI>England</HI> upon them, whether they would or no:—(Any Body may judge what a Time this was, when every day the Town was alarm'd; To Day the North was up in Arms, to Morrow the West; To Day such a Shire, to Morrow another, the next Day a Third; <HI>Glasgow, Dumfries, Hamilton, Perth,</HI> all the places which the Imagination of the People dictated, and the Fears of others apprehended.</P>
<P>It is impossible to express the Consternation of the People: Those that wished well to the Publick Peace, and who saw, that a Commotion at this Time, must immediatly involve the Nation in War, and Blood, not with <HI>England</HI> only, but with one another; these Trembled for Fear of the Desolation of their Country, the Blood and Ruine that always attends a Civil War, and the Danger of the Lives of themselves and their Relations.</P>
<P>Those who look'd seriously into the Drift of some of that Party, who most eagerly push'd on these Divisions, who saw how the Interest of a Popish, a <HI>Jacobite,</HI> and a Persecuting Bloody Ge∣neration <HI>lately extinguish'd, and now full of Hopes,</HI> was Twisted, and all joyn'd in Anti-Union Principles, could not but be heartily con∣cern'd for the Establish'd Religion, and Protestant Church; which they must have been wilfully blind, who could not see was plainly struck at, by the Opposers of this Treaty.</P>
<P>To see others, whose Designs could not be suspected of any thing, to the Detriment of either Religion, or their Native Country, yet joyning blindly with a Wicked and Degenerate Race, and seeming to approve the Steps which were taken, to the Ruine and Destructi∣on of both; To see these shut their Eyes against the plain Disco∣veries of a stated Resolution against both Liberty and Religion, and encourage, <HI>nay, in too much</HI> joyn with them, who were known Enemies both to the National Church, and Protestant Succession; These, I say, were very Melancholly Things, when the Prospect of them was so near to those, who were sincerely concerned for the Peace of the Country, and the Safety of the Reformed Religion;—And People went up and down wandering and amazed, expecting every day strange Events; afraid of Peace, and afraid of War; Many knew not which way to fix their Resolutions; They could not be clear for the Union; yet they saw Death at the Door, in its breaking off; Death to their Liberty, to their Religion, and to their Country.</P>
<P>Here were good People of all Opinions, as well as others; Some were against the Union, on a Principle of Justice and Honesty, as earnestly as others were against it, on a Principle of Treachery to their Country; Some were firmly possess'd, that they were under National Engagements, which, in the Nature of them, clash'd with the Union; and that therefore, however it might be necessary for the Safety, and Peace of either Church, or Nation, they could not get over those Obligations, or consent to this Evil, that the other Good might come;—And however these might, in the Conse∣quence of the Thing, Countenance the wicked Foundation, on which
<PB N="34" REF="245"/>
the other acted; yet I cannot but do them that Justice, that I be∣lieve, they were far from the least Intention, to encourage the strengthening a Party, whose Principle was <HI>French</HI> Government, and a Popish Sovereign. I will not answer for Indiscretion, or Errors in Temper in some; neither will I be so unjust, as to call every wrong Step an Error of Principle, and every mistaken Man a Plotter against his Country.</P>
<P>This was the unhappy divided Condition of this People, at the beginning of the Treaty. The Division was so general, that it spread thro' every part; The Gentry were divided, the Common People divided, nay, the very Ministers were divided; Parliament, Assembly, Court, City, Counties, Towns, nay, almost every Fa∣mily were divided; and as the Event began to be feared on every side, People stood strangely doubtful of one another.</P>
<P>The Commission of the Assembly hitherto carryed, <HI>as before noted,</HI> with a great deal of Prudence and Moderation; and tho there were some unhappy Struggles there, which perhaps were pointed, by the same Party, at making a Breach; yet as they came to no Head, and were soon crush'd by the Wisdom and Conduct of the rest, I shall not preserve the Memory of them to Posterity; The general Proceed∣ings of that Reverend Body being always Tempered with Modesty, Calmness, and Discretion, at the same time that they were anxi∣ously concerned for the Security of the Foundation on which they stood, and had the whole Weight of the Church of <HI>Scotlands</HI> Safety upon their Hands.</P>
<P>They had Address'd the Parliament, That Care might be taken of the Church in the Treaty; and had been assured, they should have their Expectation fully Answer'd.</P>
<P>And I cannot but remark here, That the Foundation of this Trea∣ty herein appeared to have been wisely laid; The Understandings and well poised Judgments of its first Contrivers was very Conspicu∣ous, in leaving the respective Parliaments a full Liberty, so to Esta∣blish the several Churches, as that all the Security they could de∣mand, one against the other, should be granted them; That every Root of Jealousy might be pull'd up, and there might be no Room for the Sowers of Discord to begin here, where they always used to begin; and from whence all the Mischiefs of former Dissention used to flow.</P>
<P>The Parliament had also been Encouraged by the Queen, in Her Majesties Letter, <HI>Vide Folio</HI> 3<HI>d. of this Part,</HI> at the Opening this Session, to Form such Security for the Church Government, as might fully Establish the National Church of <HI>Scotland;</HI>—For the Queen having, by long Experience, and the former Contention on both sides, seen, that an Union of Principles was no more to be expected,—but plainly seeing also, that, with the Assistance of Mutual Charity, that Difference in Principle might be Consisting with an Union of Interests, and Affection, among Her People, saw, at the same time, that the only way to Establish this Peace, was, to Form such Securities to both Churches, as might, for ever, re∣remove
<PB N="35" REF="246"/>
all just Ground of Jealousies, from among them, take away the Suspicions, and shut all the Doors against the Fears, which ei∣ther had entertain'd of each other; and which wicked Men daily took hold of, as Handles of Contention, to keep open an Eternal Breach, and keep us always divided, <HI>Ephraim</HI> against <HI>Judah,</HI> and <HI>Judah</HI> against <HI>Ephraim;</HI> ever vexing and envying one another.</P>
<P>In this Posture, I say, stood the Affairs of the Church; when, in the Interval of Time, between the first Address to the Parliament, and the second Reading of the Articles, <HI>Vide Minuts, Folio</HI> An Overture, or Draught of an Act for the Church, was conceived, and on the {left blank} of {left blank} was presented to the House.</P>
<P>I shall not enter into a long Debate which arose here, both with∣out Doors and within. 1. As to the Sufficiency and Insufficiency of the Overture, which, in some part, may be Answer'd, by say∣ing, it received some Amendments or Additions afterwards, at the passing into an Act. Or, 2. As to any Act of Parliament being a sufficient Security for the Church; That Objection being raised at first, not by such as designed a better Security, but by such as real∣ly designed no Security at all, for the Ecclesiastical Establishment in this Nation: It is hard, That we must be forced to distinguish the Disputes in this Case, by distinguishing the Persons; for there be∣ing several Parties here, and of several Principles, who all seem'd to make but one Party against the Union, it was absolutely necessary to Examine who was for this, or that Argument; and, by the Man, the Reason of his Argument, was to be distinguished.</P>
<P>This Untiddled the Mystery, which appear'd in the Debates of this Time; when those that had really least Kindness for the Church, were the loudest, and appear'd the most Zealous for her Se∣curity: Nay, those that never owned, or acknowledged either her Discipline, or Government, never submitted to her Judicatories, or joyn'd with her Worship, were now every day crying out of want of Security, Exposing the Church to the Votes of the Bishops in the <HI>British</HI> Parliament, and giving the Episcopal Church of <HI>England</HI> the Ascendant over the Presbyterian Church of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>This Language could be no otherwise understood, but by distin∣guishing the People that spoke it; The very Party were Hierogly∣phicks to the Dialect; and he must be blinder than most People are, in this Intelligent Age, that could imagine, these People spoke this from a true Design to obtain for the Church a farther or bet∣ter Security, so much as to embarras the Church and the State, em∣broil the Parliament with the Commission; and either prevent its being finished at all, or obtain what they generally drove at, in all their Managements now in the Affair; and, which was the only thing they could hope in, <HI>I mean, A DELAY.</HI></P>
<P>But to leave this Matter a while, the Parliament was all this time Reading over the Articles, and Discoursing or Reasoning upon them, but had not yet come to any Vote; The Tumult at <HI>Edin∣burgh,</HI> was blown over, without the expected Event; we shall now see, that it was not in <HI>Edinburgh</HI> alone, that a Tumult was design∣ed,
<PB N="36" REF="247"/>
but Steps were taken, <HI>and indeed Politickly enough,</HI> to have the general Sense of the Kingdom to run in the same Channel.</P>
<P>To this End, Addresses were set on Foot, in several parts of the Kingdom against the Union: I shall not pretend to croud this Book with the particular Addresses, tho some of them are remarkable enough; However, I shall give <HI>Specimens</HI> of some of them to judge from, and to make the Matter, as I go along, the plainer.</P>
<P>And, among them, I cannot omit one from the Convention of the Royal Burghs; because some Gentlemen, especially in <HI>England,</HI> having valued their Opinion from thence, as if it were the Sense of the whole Nation: It is a little necessary, towards clearing up this Point, That, tho the People were screw'd up to a most Un∣expected, and indeed Unaccountable Aversion; yet that, in the whole, the main Body of the Nation did not run the length which some of their Leaders desir'd of them, and which they would have had pass'd as their Act and Deed.</P>
<P>The Royal Burghs have a Custom in <HI>Scotland,</HI> that they act in a Body, and have a Convention, or Representative of their own, which meets upon Occasion at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and are conveened by the Lord Provost of <HI>Edinburgh:</HI> To this Convention, every Burgh sends one Member, and the Burgh of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> two; Their whole Representative is sixty six in Number.—Now the Calcu∣lation which was observable here, was in the Number and Quality of the Burghs, which Voted in the Convention; The Address was carryed by four Voices indeed, but the State of the Case is thus; Of sixty six Burghs, twenty Voted against Addressing, and twenty four for it, the rest were absent. But take the Quality of the Burghs, to make the Calculation by, and there the thing will discover it self as follows;</P>
<P>Take the Burghs that refused to Address, and these that did not think it worth while to appear; and the Majority against the Ad∣dressers, is, by the Proportion of <HI>their Cess,</HI> as eighty six to four∣teen. Nay, suppose all those that did not appear to be Affirmatives, tho that be altogether improbable, and that they would have been for the Address, yet the Proportion had been, as thirty one to six∣ty nine.—</P>
<P>But if <HI>the Rate of the Cess</HI> be not a just Estimate of the Value of the Burghs, <HI>tho I can prove it was the Original of their Right of being Burghs;</HI> then I refer to any Man to calculate the Inhabitants and Number of Free-men in each Burgh, and he will find the twenty Burghs that refused to Address, have more Inhabitants in them, than both the twenty four that Address'd, and the twenty two that were absent, the City of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> excepted.</P>
<P>So that, upon the Foot of this Calcul, tho the Address may legal∣ly be called the Address of the Burrows; yet it did not follow, that the Trading Part of the Nation had Addressed, or were against the Union; for that, in an Arithmetical Calculation, or a Calculation upon Value and Payment of Taxes, the far greater Number opposed the very Addressing at all.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="248"/>
This is observed here, in order to clear up a Point hereafter; which will require a like kind of Calculating, on the Foot of the whole Nation.</P>
<P>The Burghs however, by this seeming Majority, did Address; and because the said Address is very particular, and contains in it all the Popular Arguments, which the Enemies of the Treaty had blinded the People with, <HI>as before;</HI> particularly of the Surrender∣ing the Sovereignity, and Independency of the Nation, and Sub∣jecting their Religion, Church Government, Claim of Right, Laws, Liberties, and Trade, to be Altered or Subverted by the <HI>English</HI> in a <HI>British</HI> Parliament; For this Reason, I have given you the Address it self at large in the <HI>Appendix, N<SUP>o</SUP>. D x.</HI></P>
<P>I cannot, <HI>I confess,</HI> but wonder, how it was possible to impose things so absurd upon a whole Nation! And how so Great a People, so clear Sighted, and Wary in all other Cases, came, at this time, to run so apparently upon a plain Mistake! Since, as nothing is more plain, than that the Articles of the Treaty, and consequently the Great Heads mentioned in the above Address, can∣not be touch'd by the Parliament of <HI>Britain;</HI> and that the Moment they Attempt it, they Dissolve their own Constitution; so it is an Union upon no other Terms, and is expresly Stipulate, what shall, and what shall not be Alterable by the subsequent Parliaments;—And as the Parliaments of <HI>Britain</HI> are founded, not upon the Ori∣ginal Right of the People, as the separate Parliaments of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland</HI> were before, but upon the Treaty, which is prior to the said Parliament, and consequently superior;—So, for that Reason, it cannot have Power to Alter its own Foundation, or Act against the Power which formed it; since all Constituted Power is Subordinate, and Inferior to the Power Constituting.</P>
<P>This is so clear, and has been so often Inculcated in this very Case, and is so Unanswerably Stated in the very Acts of Par∣liament themselves, <HI>Ratifying the Treaty,</HI> that I need say no more to it here.</P>
<P>But it was a strange Time now, and there was no making the least Impression upon the Minds of the People, <HI>already prepossess'd;</HI>—Nothing was to be heard now, but of Slavery to the <HI>English,</HI> running away with the Crown, taking away their Nation, and the like:—And it was impossible to Stem this Tide of Distraction for a Time;—It is true, that the Generality of the People came off from this Delusion at last; and the Unalterableness of the Uni∣on, if finish'd, began to obtain a little upon the Senses of the Peo∣ple;—The Truth is, the Demonstration of the Thing was so visible, that it could not but prevail; and the Best, and most Ju∣dicious, beginning to see into it, the rest of the People began, to sink under the Power of the Conviction, and so by Degrees the Scruple began to wear off.</P>
<P>Nay, the same People, who first argued against this Truth, <HI>viz. Of the Parliament of</HI> Britains <HI>not being able to Invade the Treaty,</HI> took it up themselves afterward, when it served their Turn, and strongly
<PB N="38" REF="249"/>
urged it against Consenting to the Church Establishment on the <HI>English</HI> Side; since it was a Confirming the Episcopal Power, and setting it up above the Power of a Parliament to pull down; <HI>So freely will Men accept of an Argument, when it serves their Occasion, which they will reject, while it seems to oppose their Interest.</HI></P>
<P>In the Ruines of this Suggestion, another started up; which, as it was capable of being Embarass'd with greater Doubts, and with some, had Insuperable Difficulties; so, had not the Mode∣ration of the Ministers Interposed, it might have been of far worse Consequence in this Case; and this was a Scruple against the Uni∣on in Gross, as being directly against, and inconsistent with the Covenant; and that therefore it could not be entred into, with∣out incurring the Guilt of National Perjury.</P>
<P>This brought the Church into the General Appearance against the Treaty;—Nor will I say, but that great Means were used, if possible, to bring the Commission then sitting, to declare against the Union. upon this Account.</P>
<P>This was a great Tryal of Skill; and I say, this rose out of the Ruines of the other Scruple, because it was forcibly enough alledg∣ed, That, if the Constitution of this Treaty was such, that no Al∣teration could be suffered; and that not the Parliament of <HI>Britain</HI> could infringe one Article of it; Then this for ever shut the Door against the Possibility of their Assisting, to Reform the Church of <HI>England,</HI> which they alledged, by their Covenant, they were bound to use all lawful Endeavours to perform.</P>
<P>This, and submitting to the Jurisdiction of the Bishops in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> and who were to sit still in the <HI>British</HI> Parliament, and there∣by owning the Agency of Spiritual Men in Civil Imployments, they also alledged was against the Covenant: And consequently, if the Nation went into this Union, they incurred directly the Guilt of National Perjury; and I allow, that a great many Good and Va∣luable People were very Melancholly upon this Head, and some are not easy in it to this Hour.</P>
<P>I cannot pass this thing here, without speaking to it; because I foresee dayly Disputes do still arise upon this Head, and are like to do so every day, and I shall not interrupt the Thread of the Story by it at all; rather it will seem necessary to be considered, in or∣der to carry on the Course of the Story, some of which, particular∣ly <HI>at this very Juncture,</HI> very much depends upon it.</P>
<P>I am not at all entring here, upon the Obligation of the several Convenants, engaged in by the People of <HI>Scotland;</HI> 'Tis necessary here, for Argument sake, to allow them to be Obligatory, in as large a Sense as can be desired.</P>
<P>As to the being Obliged to Reform the Church of CHRIST in the whole Island;—It is granted here, by the most severe Assertors of the Covenants Obligation.</P>
<P N="1">1. That, <HI>as is express'd,</HI> they are to use all lawful Means only; and that they are not to use any such thing as Force.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="250"/>
And the Reverend Doctor <HI>Rule,</HI> a Divine of great Candor and Learning, and Principal of the College of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> has stated this Obligation very distiuctly, as follows,<Q>What we are bound to by the Covenant, is not to Reform them, but to concur with them, when lawfully called, to advance Reformation; And it is far from our Thought, to go beyond that Boundary, in being con∣cern'd in their Affairs, we wish their Reformation, but leave the mana∣ging of it to themselves. <BIBL>Doctor <HI>Rule's second Vindication of the Church of</HI> Scotland, <HI>P.</HI> 16.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>Now I think nothing is more clear, than that there is all the Room in the World for the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> to concur in a Na∣tional Reformation, notwithstanding the Union; Nay, they will be better Qualifyed for it, now than ever; in so far as they will, I hope, always have the Assistance of all Good Men in the South, both Dissenters, and Church Men, to Encourage them.</P>
<P>As to the Civil Power of Church Men, or in <HI>English,</HI> the Bishops Voting in the Parliament, and its being declared against in the Co∣venant; I will not Dispute the Suggestion, whether it be against the Covenant or no, the Discord lyes here.</P>
<P>One Party says, it is expresly against the Covenant; and that the yielding to it, and yielding to have the Church of <HI>England</HI> e∣stablished by the Treaty, is setting up that very Power they were sworn to Reform, to the utmost of their Power, in all lawful Means; and these are the particulars, in which, they say, the Union is a Breach upon the Covenant, and has brought the Nation into the dreadful Sin of publick Perjury.</P>
<P>The other say,</P>
<P N="1">1. They are not guilty of National Perjury; For that they con∣ceive, the Union does no way oblige them further, than as before, in the Sense of Doctor <HI>Rule,</HI> to concur with all lawful Methods for Reformation, and to close with all Opportunities, which shall be put into their Hands for the Purpose; and this they are yet as free to do as before.</P>
<P N="2">2. As to their Consenting to the Act for the Security, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> it is not against the Covenant, since it is not an Erecting a Church; Nay, it is not, in the least, a Recog∣nizing or Acknowledging them that are Erected;—but 'tis a letting <HI>that be,</HI> which <HI>was before,</HI> and which they had no lawful Call, <HI>the Thing expresly mentioned in the Covenant,</HI> to concern themselves in Altering; They were not legally called to it, for they were legal∣ly, at this time, excluded on either side, from meddling in the respective Settlements of the Church, by the Queens Power.</P>
<P>And, at last, they alledge, that, in so far as the Covenant en∣gages them against the Civil Power of Church Men, they did ex∣onerate themselves fairly, in their publick Protest against the Votes of the Bishops, <HI>viz.</HI> The Representation and Petition, Rejecting, as far as in them lyes, all Submission to their said Power; and that they conceive, being not called to any other opposition, they
<PB N="40" REF="251"/>
have fully discharged their Duty as a Nation, and have, to the ut∣most of their Power, opposed it.</P>
<P>I think, this is a clear, tho' a short State of the Question; And some of the most Conscientious and Pious, of both Ministers and People, on one side, thought the Case of the Covenant clear in this Point.</P>
<P>I know, there are others dissatisfied still, of whom I have only this to say, If they are certain it is a National Crime, I wish they would apply themselves to National Humiliation, and be found of them that stand in the Gap, to prevent GOD's Judgments, rather than forgetting that part, fill the Days with their Complaint of the Sin,—and only apply it, to make the People uneasy at the Occa∣sion.</P>
<P>The Union is finisht: Even breaking it again, if that were in their Power, would not undo the Crime, if it be one; and would, at the same time, involve their Country in a Thousand Calamities, Blood and Distresses.</P>
<P>I cannot be so Uncharitable, as to think, any Man that raises the Scruple we are now upon, would be willing to be thought to be moving the Nation, to break this New, and most Solemn Conjunc∣tion, and fall all to pieces again: I would then ask, To what end are publick Exclamations, and Excursions of the Tongue about it? They can tend to nothing, but to keep the People in a continual Alarm, keep their Minds in a constant Perturbation and Uneasi∣ness; and 'tis a sad Work for any Man to be employed in, meerly to disturb and distract his Country.</P>
<P>While these things were debating at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> the Affair grew still darker and darker all over the Kingdom; and they were far from carrying it with equal Temper and Moderation in other Places.</P>
<P>In the West, the People, called <HI>Cameronians,</HI> began to be appre∣hended as Dangerous, and that Cloud was diligently represented as very Black; That, according to the Rash Wishes of some People, <HI>whose Endeavours too had not been wanting,</HI> they would fall into some Desperate Action or other on this Account;—The Prejudices a∣gainst the Union had reach'd them very early: Nor was it to be supposed, that those People, who were so diligent to Alarm the Country every where against the Union, and possess'd them with Fears and Jealousies of their Liberties, Trade, Crown, and Religi∣on, would fail to fall to Work in these Parts, where they must needs know, the general Character of the People, was to be Tenacious of their Opinions; and far from being always prescribed by the most Prudent and Moderate Councils;—As to other Places, the Arguments were suited to the People, as to some, the Loss of Trade, to others Taxes, to these the Liberty, to those the Sovereign∣ty of the Nation, so to these the great Pretence used, was Religion, the Danger of, not the Church, <HI>for that many of them did not sub∣mit to or acknowledge;</HI>—But Religion in general, and these two Heads in particular, the Return of Prelacy, and the Breach of the
<PB N="41" REF="252"/>
Covenant; However, they had all the very same things in their Allegations.</P>
<P>In carrying on the Design of Enslaving these poor People, great Artifice was used;—And, as if they had been prepared for the Design before hand,—they waited till the Articles were printed, which were formed by the Treaters in <HI>England,</HI> and the several Mi∣nuts of the Treaty.</P>
<P>When these were seen, a Number of these People got together; And tho they were not the Number by far, as was diligently re∣ported, in order to make them Formidable; yet the Beginning might have been Dangerous enough, if it had been push'd on far∣ther; what Number they might really be in other places, I could ne∣ver learn so particularly, as to venture asserting it: But about Two Hundred Men, in a Tumultuous Manner, came to the Town of <HI>Dumfreis,</HI> a Sea-port on the West-side of <HI>Scotland,</HI> about Twen∣ty Eight Miles from <HI>Carlisle;</HI>—They came into the Town in the Middle of the Day, on the Twentieth of <HI>November,</HI> made a Fire in the Market Place, burnt the Articles of the Union, and burnt a Paper with the Names of the Commissioners of the Treaty, and fix∣ed another Paper of their own upon the Cross; and having done thus, they march'd off, and dispers'd themselves peaceably.</P>
<P>This Paper indeed was no less Seditious in its Nature, than the Attempt was Insolent and Daring.</P>
<P>When the Report came to <HI>Edinburgh</HI> of this Tumult, the Concern of those, who wish'd well to their Country, was very great, and Wise Men began to give the Design of the Treaty for lost; They knew the unhappy Temper of those Honest People; for such, how∣ever, I must call them, because I believe their Intention is Religious and Honest, tho they may be mistaken, and, no doubt, are mista∣ken, in their Principles, about Government and Obedience; But, as they knew, I say, the Temper of these People, how Tenacious of their own Sentiments, and how Precipitant in their Prosecution, it bred no small Concern in the Minds of all People, who were in∣clin'd to Peace; Concluding, That the Party, who opposed the Union from worse Principles, had gain'd their Point, <HI>viz.</HI> To im∣ploy the Hands of Protestants, one against another, in this Dispute, and make the Honest Meaning, but Warm People, the Tools to Ruine both themselves, and their Country.</P>
<P>There were not wanting, at the same time, People, who dili∣gently spread Extravagant Rumours of the Numbers of these People; Some said, that there were Six Thousand Men in Arms at the Place; others, that Two Thousand Horse only came into the Town; and that Five Thousand Foot-stood ready, in the Hill Country, to March with them, as Occasion should require: Others, that the whole Bo∣dy of them were up; and that the whole West was in Arms, and at least Twelve Thousand of them were to March for <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> to raise the Parliament; and that they had publickly declared, they would Sacrifice the Treaters, as Betrayers of their Country, and Sel∣lers of her Liberty and Sovereignty.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="253"/>
To back these Reports, the Paper they fix'd up at <HI>Dumfreis</HI> was officiously printed; and at the End of it, a Postscript, signifying, <HI>That this Paper was publickly read from the Market Cross at</HI> Dumfreis, <HI>about one of the Clock Afternoon, on the Twentieth of</HI> November <HI>One Thousand Seven Hundred and Six, with great Solemnity, in the Audi∣ence of many Thousands; the Fire being surrounded with double Squa∣drons of Horse and Foot in Martial Order.</HI></P>
<P>The printing of this Paper was resented by the Government, and the Printer fled from their Hands for the present; but this, as all other Insults of this Nature, were no farther prosecuted, the Govern∣ment choosing rather to pity and overlook the Follies of the People, on this Occasion, as what they saw was politickly Enflamed by a Party, who only sought to Embroil the Nation, and bring the best of the People to fall out with one another, that the Game might be made up out of the Destruction of both.</P>
<P>By this Postscript above, may appear to any Unbyass'd Person, the Artifice made use of, to magnify every Story, to encrease the Terror of the People, and, if possible, to encourage the like Confu∣sions in other Places; For, as to the Fact, 'tis true, there were a Rabble of Country People, to the Number, as above, of about Two Hundred; I could never find, that they deserved to be called more;—That there was any such thing, as Squadrons or Com∣panies, either of Horse or Foot, or any Martial Order, such as Offi∣cers or Commanders, or any thing like Troops, was a manifest For∣gery, on purpose to Amuse the Nation, and make the People Be∣lieve, what they really had some Ground to Fear.</P>
<P>I must also do those People in the West this Justice, that, tho great Endeavours had been used to Exasperate them, and they were heartily against the Union, as appear'd, upon all Occasions;—But when they came to see a little into the Hands that were at Work against it, and with whom they were like to joyn, even the Hottest among them came to themselves, and to give them their Due, they behaved with great Calmness and Discretion; nor could they be brought into any Precipitations or Extravagancies, as was dayly threatned;—Mr. <HI>John Hepburn,</HI> their chief Leader and Minister, had been Reflected on, as one that had Inflamed and Animated them to rise and take Arms, and that had been said to threaten the Parliament;—when he was Discoursed with by some, who were under Concern for the publick Peace, it discovered the Frauds and Falsities of those Suggestions, and how they were spread about to serve the great end of the publick Disorders, and only amuse the World; for he declared himself readily, that indeed they had Ap∣prehensions, that the Union would be prejudicial to them; that they did not like the Articles, and thought the Treaters had not done their Duty, and the like; but that, as to their having any Design to disturb the Government, or to appear in Arms, it was an Abuse upon them; They had no such Thought, nor should they do any thing, but in a National Way; much less would they adhere to,
<PB N="43" REF="254"/>
or encourage the Designs of a <HI>Jacobite French</HI> Party, whom, he de∣clared, they abhorred, and would never joyn with.</P>
<P>I think this is a plain Demonstration of the Truth of what I have alledged all along this Story, <HI>viz.</HI> That there was a busy Party, who run thro' the whole Country, by all possible Artifice, to Agi∣tate and Disturb the Minds of the peaceable People; and, if pos∣sible, to bring them first to mistaken Notions about, and Aversions to the Union in general; and then, to pursue those Aversions, by all possible Methods of Distraction and Confusion; and that this might bring the Honest and Well-meaning People of the Nation, either by their Numbers and Interest, to overthrow the Treaty; or, by their Folly and Miscarriage, to overthrow themselves, and so to weaken both.</P>
<P>But GOD's Goodness to this Innocent People disappointed them here, and we never found the least Tumult or Disorder on this side afterward, to the particular Mortification of the Party that hoped for worse things from them.</P>
<P>The Declaration therefore, or Protest, which they posted up at <HI>Dumfries,</HI> and which the Party handed about at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> as a great Instance of what they hoped for from them, is rather published here, as an Example of the Notions they had poisoned the Minds of the People with, than as the Sense of the Nation, in the Case of the Union, and a Sketch of what they endeavoured to obtain from all the rest, <HI>Appendix, N. E. x.</HI></P>
<P>We are now, in the Process of this Affair, come on to the middle of <HI>November;</HI>—I must desire the Reader, to go back a little to the Parliament; They had begun to read the Articles the second time, in order to Vote on them; The beginning was a remarkable Debate, and held for several days, as will appear in the Minuts.</P>
<P>The first Article was like putting the previous Question, <HI>viz.</HI> Whether there should be an Union with <HI>England,</HI> in the Sense of the present Articles, or no: That is, whether there should be an Incorporate Union of the Nation into one Kingdom, to have but one Name, Head, Signature, Constitution and Parliament, Yea or No.</P>
<P>The Manner of this Question, and the Difficulty with which it was carried in the House, I refer to the Minuts, <HI>Folio</HI> But I cannot but observe one significant <HI>Omen</HI> of the future good Success of this Treaty, and which, I must owne, very much encouraged me to think it would go on, notwithstanding all the vigorous Opposition it met with, was, That it was Voted on the most remarkable Day for Publick Deliverance, that ever happened to this Island. I am as far from laying any Stress on such insignificant Circumstances, as any Man; and I know, they can have no Efficiency in the bring∣ing to pass the mighty Events, which may be usher'd so into the World; and therefore I bespeak the Reader to note this, not as a thing I lay any real Weight upon.</P>
<P>And yet it was impossible to observe, without some Emotion of the Mind, and without some Presage of the good Issue of this Matter;
<PB N="44" REF="255"/>
That the first Article, being the Great and Essential Part of the U∣nion, was Voted and Approved on that remarkable 4<HI>th</HI> Day of <HI>No∣vember,</HI> which was made happy to <HI>Britain; First,</HI> By the Birth of the Great and Immortal King <HI>William,</HI> to whom these Nations owe so much, that they cannot look on their Church Restored, the Bloody Persecuting Race of Tyrants Abdicated and Fled, Cruelty and Prelacy Dethroned, and all the Mischiefs of a Ruin'd Nation Vanished, and not Bless the Memory of that Great Agent of GOD's Goodness to them, without remarkable Ingratitude both to GOD Himself the Original, and to that Glorious Instrument of our Feli∣city the King;—Nor was it this alone, which rendered this Day remarkable to us, but also, that the great and remarkable Revolu∣tion of <HI>Britain</HI> formed in, and founded upon the Expedition of the same King <HI>William,</HI> bears Date from this Time, being the Day which he first Landed on at <HI>Torbay</HI> in the West of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>It could not but be a pleasant Reflection to those, who remem∣bred the particulars of these things, to find, that, without any pre∣vious Calculation, or Direction of Men, the Concurrence of Causes should so effectually jump, for the bringing to pass the most remar∣kable Transactions of <HI>Britain's</HI> Establishment on the same Day; That her Deliverance from Tyranny, and the many many Oppressi∣ons of a most Cruel and Barbarous Generation, that Aim'd at Sup∣pressing the Foundations of Liberty, and Overthrowing the Consti∣tution of both Kingdoms;—And her Deliverance from private Antipathies, the Peace of her Inhabitants, and the great Conjuncti∣on, <HI>WE HOPE,</HI> of the Hearts and Affections of Two Nations, which, for many Years, had been filled with the most Fatal and Inveterat Aversions, should take their Rise together, and Date their Beginning both on the same Fourth of <HI>November;</HI> and both on that very Day, when the Great Instrument of her Deliverance, by whom she was put in a Condition to bring all the rest to pass, was born into the World. Happy Day! Happy to <HI>Britain!</HI> Happy to all <HI>Europe!</HI> Since the Events of this Birth, the Actions of Heaven in the Hand of this Prince, have been the Foundation of all the Glorious Things, which have since happened in <HI>Europe,</HI> and of the Humbling the Great Thunderer of this Age, who had Established his Kingdom in the Destruction of the Liberties of <HI>Europe,</HI> and in a View of the Subver∣version of the Protestant Religion.</P>
<P>It was, on this Happy Day, that the first Article of the Union was pass'd in the Parliament, after Infinite Struggles, Clamour, Railing, and Tumult of a Party; who, however they endeavour∣ed to Engage the Honest Scrupulous Part of the People with them, yet gave this Eminent Discovery of the Principles of their own Actings, in that there was an Entire Conjunction of the <HI>Jacobite,</HI> the <HI>Prelatick,</HI> and the <HI>Popish</HI> Interest, in this particular; and the very Discovery of this, opened the Eyes of a great many People, who, in the Simplicity of their Hearts, had joyned in the general Opposition to the Union; but, when they saw the Tendency of Things, and whither it all led, when they saw the Society they
<PB N="45" REF="256"/>
were going to Embark with; when they saw the Enemies of the Protestant Settlement all Engag'd, and these very People, who had filled the Land with the Groans of Oppression, and the Cries of Blood,—coming to Joyn Hands with them, against an Union with <HI>England;</HI> when they saw, that, to shun an Union with Chri∣stians, they were, of Necessity, to come into an Union with De∣vils; Men that had Transformed themselves into the very In∣fernal Nature, and visibly Acted from Principles, in this particular Diabolical, in that they Tended to Erect the Absolute Subjection of Nations to the Lust, and Unbounded Appetites of Lawless Ty∣rants; when they saw these things so plainly, we then found an Alte∣ration, and the best, the most thinking, and most Judicious People, began first to stop, and consider, and afterward wholly to withdraw from the Party; and the Clamour of the People, as if come to a <HI>Crisis,</HI> began not to be so universal, but to abate; and the more it did so, the more the secret Party, who lay at the Bottom of all the rest, began to appear, and distinguish themselves.</P>
<P>The first Article being past, the Hopes of the Party depended upon Debating the Matters of Taxes, Excises, Customs; and, as far as possible, setting up the Popular Arguments of Care for the Poor,—the Impossibility of paying Duties, the Incapacity of the Trade to support Excises and Customs, and the like; and here they had Recourse from one Shift to another, and, like True Souldiers, tho in a Bad Cause, they fought their Ground by Inches.</P>
<P>From Article to Article, they Disputed every Word, every Clause, Casting Difficulties and Doubts in the way of every Argument, Twisting and Turning every Question, and continually Starting Objections to gain Time; and, if possible, to throw some Un∣surmountable Obstacle in the way.</P>
<P>The Consequence of this was, making Amendments to the Ar∣ticles; Nor was it a small Disappointment to them, when they saw the Parliament willing to come into Amendments; and when, by the Prudence of the Committee, Appointed to make Calculati∣ons, and Examine those already made, it appeared, that their Ob∣jections were either Answer'd and Confuted, or the Clauses so Recti∣fied and Amended, as that they had no more Room to fasten any of their Cavils; They were intirely Defeated, and the Disaster was particular in this, that it shew'd still the more plainly to the World, that their Design was not to be satisfied in the Amendment, and Alteration of what they Objected against; but, in having something to demand, that would not, or could not have been reconciled.</P>
<P>This caused a great many Trifling Emendations to pass, which, in themselves, had not Signification enough, either to deserve the Name of Objections, or to need any Disputing.</P>
<P>'Tis evident, the Design was to load the Treaty with a Multitude of Amendments; Among which, it was to be hoped, some-might be found, which the Parliament of <HI>England</HI> would Scruple; or, at least, that it would be a Precedent for the Parliament of <HI>England</HI> to Consider the Treaty, and make more Amendments; which being
<PB N="46" REF="257"/>
to come down to <HI>Scotland</HI> again, to be considered here, would bring another Sitting on of Course; when, by Delays, the Time fix'd to the First of <HI>May</HI> might be elapsed, the Season of the Year ad∣vance, which hitherto had not favour'd them for the Riots and Tumults of the Country; and, in this Delay, they might find fur∣ther Advantages.</P>
<P>How their future Actions conformed to this Suggestion, and how they were, in every Step, disappointed, is the next thing to be dis∣cours'd on;—But I must Adjourn it a little, and Return to the Af∣fairs of the Church, which were, at this time, in equal Agitation, proportionably considered; and the Party who opposed the Union, used all possible Artifice to bring things into Confusion there, in which they discovered a double Mischief in their Design, 1. To bring to pass the grand Design of Obstructing the Treaty. And, 2. if possible, to make the Disorders they aim'd at, take their Rise in the Churches Dissatisfactions; by which last Thing, two other Ends would have been obtain'd.<LIST>
<ITEM>1. They would have fix'd the Scandal of all the Consequences, even of their own rashest Actions, upon the Church.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. They would have drawn in Multitudes of Zealous, but In∣nocent People, to have push'd on their Designs blindly, imagi∣ning they had been Acting for the Church.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>But, as before, so even now, the Prudence and Steadiness of the Ministers, in the Commission of the Assembly, defeated all the wicked Designs of this Party;—For tho there were, in the Com∣mission, a great many Ministers, who were sincerely and heartily a∣gainst the Union,—yet they were not to be drawn in to Act with so much Imprudence, as the Projects of that Party designed; and therefore, what ever of Heat, or unhappy Warmth, at several times, happen'd there; and which, at one time, was feared, would have gone higher, yet the Temper and Sincerity of the main Body, both Ministers and Elders, always over-ruled, and, in good time, suppress'd it.</P>
<P>I have already given you the Address, which the Commission of the Assembly gave in to the Parliament, in order to obtain a Securi∣ty for the Church.—This Address effectually Answer'd the End of the Ministers, in that it obtain'd a Vote in Parliament, <HI>Novem∣ber</HI> 2<HI>d, viz. That, immediatly after the first Article of the Ʋnion was Voted, the Parliament will proceed to an Act for the Security of the Do∣ctrine, Discipline, Worship and Government of the Church, as now by Law Established within this Kingdom.</HI></P>
<P>All this Time an Overture, or a Draught of an Act, Intituled, <HI>An Act for Security of the True Protestant Religion, and the Government of the Church, as by Law Established within this Kingdom,</HI> was Read, and Ordered to be Printed.</P>
<P>While this Overture was preparing in the Parliament; and after it was printed, there was no small Endeavours used to possess the Minds of the People, that it was not a sufficient Security for the Church.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="258"/>
There had been some Suggestions spread, that the Parliament would put them off, without effectually securing the Church; and all possible Care was taken to improve this Notion, and the People were agitated on that Head, as much as possible: Some said, the Overture ought to have been drawn up by the Commission, not by the Parliament; and that it was leading them on in the Dark, with a general Vote, that an Act should be pass'd, without letting the Church judge, what was sufficient for her Security, and what not.</P>
<P>It was urg'd against this, That the Commission had mentioned in their Address, the Heads in which they ought to be secured; and there was no doubt, but the Parliament would make that Ad∣dress the Foundation of the Act of Security; That, if there was any thing wanting, they would have time enough to renew their Address, for the adding such things, as they judged reasonable; and that therefore they ought to stay, and not Interfere with the Proceedings of the Parliament, whose proper Work it was, to pre∣pare their own Acts.</P>
<P>But this did not satisfy some People, who insisting on the Com∣missions concerning themselves in it; The Committee for Publick Affairs moved, <HI>October</HI> 25. in the Commission, that some Members might be appointed, to see what the Parliament Men had prepar'd for the Security of the Church.</P>
<P>This was the Time, in which the Debates in the Commission run highest, and when some of the Elders, taking Offence at the Warmth of some of the Ministers, withdrew themselves from the Commission;—But wiser and more moderate Heads interposed, and prevented the ill Consequences of these things, as will after∣wards appear.</P>
<P>Upon Inspecting the Overture for Security of the Church, and Viewing the Provision made there for such Security, the Members of the Commission, who were appointed as above, Reported, That there were some Difficulties remaining, which they desired might be Considered.</P>
<P>These Difficulties began a warm Debate in the Committee of the Commission, which were Reported as Considered by the Commit∣tee; and are as follows,</P>
<P>1<HI>st,</HI> That it would seem, That the Sovereign of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> in the Coronation Oath, is to be Sworn to Maintain the Rights and Pri∣vileges of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> as by Law Established, without any Respect to the Church of <HI>Scotland.</HI> 2<HI>ly,</HI> That, by the Oath of Abjuration taken in <HI>England,</HI> obliging to Maintain the Limitations of the Succession, and Qualification of the Successor to the Crown, the Taker seems to be obliged to endeavour, to the outmost, the Seclusion even of such Protestants from the Crown of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> who are not of the Communion of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> as now by Law Established there. 3<HI>ly,</HI> Several Difficulties being proposed, with relation to Oaths, it was discours'd, how a Bar may be put to the <HI>British</HI> Parliaments Imposing Oaths upon the Ministry and Peo∣ple
<PB N="48" REF="259"/>
of <HI>Scotland,</HI> Inconsistent with the Principles of this Church. 4<HI>ly,</HI> That the People of <HI>Scotland</HI> may be exempted from the Sacra∣mental Test, in Use in <HI>England,</HI> which secludes all from any Office in <HI>Britain,</HI> or Benefit from the Crown thereof, who are of the Com∣munion of the Church of <HI>Scotland;</HI> and some other things, which was thought, might be uneasy, and of Dangerous Consequence to this Church, if not provided against in the Conclusion of the Uni∣on: And these things being Discours'd upon at great length, were again Referred to the Committee for the Publick Affairs of the Church, to be further Considered, and they to Report.</P>
<P>The Committee, to whom this Affair was Referred, Reported, That they have had several Meetings, and Discours'd at great length upon the Four Particulars relating to the Union, and heard several Ministers and others upon their Scruples thereanent; and likeways upon a Fifth Particular, That the Constitution of the <HI>British</HI> Parlia∣ment, where Twenty Six Bishops do Sit as Members, seems to be Inconsistent both with the Principles of Presbyterians, and the Co∣venants and Engagements of this Church and Nation.</P>
<P>It would be too long to set down here, how the Commission was dayly Besieg'd with Clamours and Cryes, raised upon the Jealousics of the People;—And how they were urged to all manner of im∣proper Resentment, upon the Allegation now raised against the Security of the Church, as it was offered in the Overture: This De∣bate rising so high, I think it not improper to print the Overture it self, as it was first drawn up, as well as when it was with Amend∣ments Engrossed; The first Draught therefore you will find in the <HI>Appendix, N<SUP>o</SUP>. F x.</HI></P>
<P>I shall forbear entring here into any of the Heats and Indecencies which passed upon this Debate, since they came to no Extraordinary Height; and the Wisdom and Forbearance on both sides, prevent∣ed the Evil Consequences which some hoped for from them.</P>
<P>The second Address of the Commission had its Birth in these Dis∣putes; and tho the Enemies of the Union expected great Things from it, yet, as it came out quite another Thing than they designed, having been reduc'd to Shape, and strip'd of all its Monstrous Figure, in which it was expected to come into the World, it had two Con∣sequences, which serv'd to assist even against the Party, that pro∣mised themselves so much Good from it.</P>
<P N="1">1<HI>st,</HI> It convinced the World, That however it was spread abroad, that the Commission would violently oppose the passing the Act of Security, as a Thing of no Consequence, and so put a full Stop to the Work; it was evident, the Commission was not to be Blinded by Out-sides, nor Screwed up by Parties; but that, Calm and clear Sighted, they would go on, in all Cases, with the same Gravi∣ty, Consideration and Temper, which they had shown from the Beginning.</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>ly,</HI> It obviated the great Debate about the Church here submit∣ting to the Episcopal Jurisdiction of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> or to the Votes and Suffrages of the Bishops in the <HI>British</HI> Parliament, in
<PB N="49" REF="260"/>
that, tho they did not Interfere, or Prescribe to the Parliament, yet they Exonerated their Consciences, and the whole Church of <HI>Scot∣land,</HI> by making, as it were, a Protest against it, as what they would not be understood to Comply with, either now, or by any Action in time coming, which should be the Consequence of the Union.</P>
<P>Thus the Difficulties, tho resolv'd to be presented to the Parlia∣ment, yet came out in a Modest and Humble Dress, suitable to the Dignity, as well as Distance, of the Assembly, to which, and from which, it was presented; and yet it came out in a Dress, which some Gentlemen of the Commission, particularly of the Ruling El∣ders, did not Approve of.</P>
<P>Some would have had this Address been called a Protest, but the Moderation of that Reverend Assembly crush'd that Motion; and after some Debate, it obtain'd the Title of the Representation and Petition,—and was Resolved on in the Commission the 8<HI>th</HI> of <HI>November,</HI> and the same Day presented to the Parliament. The exact Copy of this Paper, you will find in the <HI>Appendix, N<SUP>o</SUP>. G x.</HI></P>
<P>When this Paper was Agreed on in the Commission, the Earls of <HI>Rothes</HI> and <HI>Marchmont,</HI> Lords <HI>Polwarth</HI> and <HI>Forglen,</HI> Sir <HI>James Camp∣bell,</HI> the Lairds of <HI>Jerviswood</HI> and <HI>Ardkinlass</HI> younger, and several other of the Gentlemen, who Sat there as Ruling Elders, Declared their Dissent, and Entered their Protest against it, taking Instru∣ments in the Hands of the Clerk of the Commission; and promised to give in the Reasons of their Dissenting, which accordingly they gave in on the 15<HI>th</HI> of <HI>November.</HI></P>
<P>Upon the giving in these Reasons by the Elders, the Commission appointed a Committee to wait upon the Elders; and to know, if they insisted upon having their Reasons for Protesting Recorded; and to signify to them, That, if they did, the Commission would be obliged to draw up their Answer to those Reasons, and to Re∣cord the same likewise.</P>
<P>The Committee never obtain'd an Answer from the Gentlemen; in a Body; but as many as they met with, gave for Answer, That they did not insist positively on it, but left it to the Commission; either to Record it, and Form Answers to it, or not, as they saw most proper.</P>
<P>The Committee having Reported this, the Commission did, at last, think fit to Record the Protests, and the Reasons annexed, and drew up their Answers to them, tho they waited two Months be∣fore they entered it; which, because they are very material to a right Understanding of the present Debate, I have annexed to this Work, in the <HI>Appendix, N<SUP>o</SUP>. H x I x.</HI></P>
<P>I think the Reasons and Answer are a sufficient Comment upon this Text; and whoever pleases to peruse them, will see, that tho the Designs of wicked Men pointed much farther, yet the Commis∣sion, both Ministers and Elders, were wholly influenc'd by Prin∣ciples of Peace, Honour, Conscience, and the Good of the Church.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="261"/>
I know, some thought the Church went too far in this Affair, and especially in the Matter of the Sacramental Test, which seem'd a Thing perfectly remote to them, and what they could have no Concern at all in; And the Gentlemen, in particular, were yet more willing than the Ministers, to have let both that, and the Mat∣ter of the Civil Power of the Bishops quite alone.</P>
<P>But if we shall consider, how the Ministers were dayly besieg'd, <HI>as before,</HI> with the Importunate Violences of the People; How many among them really, thought this part in particular directly against the Covenant; and how, by false Reports, many had been so Imposed upon, as to Believe the Sacramental Test in <HI>England,</HI> extended even to the Members of Parliament, which should be sent from <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>When, I say, they consider the Fears and Jealousies, which over∣spread all sorts of People; and how far the Artifices of a wicked Party were, at this time, in their Meridian, and had inexpressible Influences on all sorts of People, they will, with me, admire, that the Commission was able to maintain their steady Resolution; How they Work't thro' those Flouds, and kept the middle way with Temper and Moderation, to preserve themselves from the Snares laid for them.</P>
<P>All these things considered, it was, in most Peoples Opinion, a Victory gain'd, and the Party received a manifest Disappointment, even in this Representation, in that the Commission could be brought to no Precipitations, as some People flattered themselves they should.</P>
<P>However this may be the general Opinion, I know some People took ill the Length they went in this Affair, and thought they ex∣ceeded their proper Sphere;—But, I believe, those Gentlemen are very well satisfied with the Unanswerable Arguments drawn from hence against those, <HI>who, not content with this Length,</HI> thought to Upbraid them with Forgetting the National Obligation of the Co∣venant, which they fairly quitted themselves of by that Article, in which they declare Civil Places of Church Men to be not submitted to by them, but against both their Covenant and Consciences, and so have fairly Exonerated the Church from that Affair, which stuck so near her.</P>
<P>The Representation was presented to the House, just when the Overture for the Security of the Church was under their Considerati∣on; and however it did not, at present, meet with a very favou∣rable Reception, even by those who were the Churches very Good Friends, who thought, <HI>as before,</HI> they run it too high, and also ill tim'd it; yet neither did the Gentlemen wholly omit the things requested therein, tho they seem'd to sleep for some time; but par∣ticularly the Clause about the Valuation of Teinds and Plantation of Kirks, which they pass'd an Act for by it self: The Matter of Oaths seems also settled in the Amendments to the Overture: The other, as the Matter of the Sacramental Test, and the Suffrages of
<PB N="51" REF="262"/>
Bishops in the <HI>British</HI> Parliament, was silently let fall, as things they could, by no means, meddle with in the Treaty.</P>
<P>Here the Opposers of the Union met with another Disappoint∣ment; For, had these Two Articles been insisted on, they knew the Event would have been a Rupture of the Treaty, and their great End had been Answer'd, <HI>viz.</HI> To obtain the Parliament to demand something, which they knew <HI>England</HI> could never grant.</P>
<P>Thus this Storm blew over, the Act of Security for the Church was Voted, and laid by to be annexed to the Articles, and made part of the Union, as shall afterwards appear.</P>
<P>As this had made a great Noise in the Assembly, so it had been no less canvassed all over the Nation: Some condemned the As∣sembly in the main, and pretended to censure them publickly, for engaging themselves in Matters, that had so plain a Tendency to breaking up the Union, and desiring the Parliament to concern them∣selves in those Affairs in <HI>England,</HI> which could really admit of no Debate in this Case.</P>
<P>But, as if the Commission wanted the Authority of their Consti∣tuents to back them in their Proceedings, and to justify their Con∣duct, the respective Presbyteries in the Country began to come in with Letters, or a sort of Addresses, testifying their Approbation of what the Commission had done, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But the Commission diligent∣ly avoiding every thing that was Tumultuary or Popular, gave a cold Answer to them; as particularly, to that of <HI>Dumfermling,</HI> who subjoyning to their Approbation of the Petition their Desire a∣bout Fasts Publick and Private, as in a Time of Impending Dan∣gers; The Commission Resolved, That <HI>their Act about Fasts past be∣fore, did sufficiently Answer the Presbyteries Desire,</HI> and so took no notice of the rest; which prudent way of Proceeding stopt that Design, which seem'd to be only to make the Representation as Po∣pular as they could, that it might, on the one Hand, encourage further Petitions, and secondly oblige the Parliament to come into their Measures.</P>
<P>While this was thus carrying on in the Commission, the Country began to be very Uneasy, and Threatnings came in every day, of coming up in Armies and Rabbles, to raise the Parliament, and to desire, that the Church might be secured.</P>
<P>The Presbyteries of <HI>Glasgow</HI> and of <HI>Stirling</HI> sent Letters to the Commission, containing Heads of Grievances, and representing se∣veral things, which they desired the Commission to demand of the Parliament, for the Churches Security.</P>
<P>To this the Commission of the Assembly answer'd, That they had done, or were now doing, all that was desir'd in their Letters.</P>
<P>An ill natur'd Motion was made in the Commission also, to send Circular Letters to all the Presbyteries, to send up their Members to the Commission, and a Committee was appointed to consider of it;—But this occasioned such Variety of Debates, That the Com∣mittee could come to no Resolution, but referred it back to the Commission, and there it dropped.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="263"/>
This was a plain Design to renew the Debates; and, if possible, to bring the Commission to protest, or declare themselves against the Union.</P>
<P>The Representation was now before the Parliament, but, as yet, they took no notice of it; and it was apparent, That they pursu∣ed their Treaty, for some time, without any respect to the said Representation; and indeed it was foreseen they would do so, the Gentlemen easily seeing, that, if these things were insisted, it was just a Resolution to break off the Union.</P>
<P>The other Party eagerly Reported about Town, That it was a Disrespect to the Church, not to regard her Solemn Representation; and then the Consequences of the Bishops Voting in Parliament were laid forth, and the Danger of the Church was now their general Discourse: Some were alarm'd with this <HI>Chimera,</HI> That the Par∣liament had not a sincere Respect for the Churches Safety; That the Gentlemen had no great Concern about the Matter, and so the Church would be Exposed to her Enemies, by the Negligence of her Friends.</P>
<P>But the Commission saw thro' all this; and having done what they thought their Duty, both for the Churches Security, and for the Exonerating their Consciences in the Cases they could not com∣ply with, they resolved to stand still, and leave the Consequences of Things to-Divine Providence, without pushing at Things Im∣practicable, or such Things as tended only to Division.</P>
<P>This Steadiness of the Ministers broke all the Measures of the Par∣ty; Their Hopes to Embroil the Ministers with the Parliament va∣nished;—And the Discourse of the Representation or Petition began to grow old and die.</P>
<P>The Commission had their Hands full of their Representations of another sort, about the Growth of Popery, the ill Practices of some of the Deposed Ministers, and the like, and so it wore off by Degrees.</P>
<P>I mention, in this Account, the Prudence and Moderation of the Ministers so often, not that I design to write Panegyricks here, much less to flatter the Persons of the Ministers; but who ever knew the Management of that Time, and reflects back on the Particulars, will easily joyn with me in this,—That there were several parts of Management practised upon the Ministers, in order to ruine their Counsels, besides what the Open Debates of the Commission discovered, and particularly such as follows,</P>
<P N="1">1. There was a Design, if possible, to bring the Ministers into a general Declaration against the Union, as dangerous to their Li∣berties, inconsistent with their Principles, and contrary to the Obli∣gation of the National Covenant; <HI>Of this I have spoken in the Course of the Story.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. There was a manifest Design to bring them to a Rupture a∣mong themselves; and that, if possible, supposing the Union should proceed, or not proceed, the disagreeing Party might be brought to a breaking off, or dividing from the rest, and so form a settled stated Dissent, or Breach in the Church;—Nor was this
<PB N="53" REF="264"/>
a thing of small Consequence; For it was really big with a large Variety of Mischiefs, and very cunningly contriv'd; Snares were laid for the whole Body, not of the Assembled Ministers only, but the Constitution of the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> whose Destruction was almost visible in the Project, had it met with Success.</P>
<P>Had the Union been compleated without the Concurrence of the Ministers in Commission,—either the Church Affair must have been left out, or the Enemies of it would have always said, it had been settled without her Approbation, and consequently the Settle∣ment been both Imperfect and Illegal.</P>
<P>Had one Party declared for the Union, and another against it, and, had both those Parties adhered to their respective Declarati∣on, by any publick Separation as a Party, the House had been di∣vided against it self, and the Consequence would have been hoped for with but too much probability.</P>
<P>In this very Case, the Prudence of the Ministers, I say, was re∣markable, and next to the Wisdom of Providence directing, was the only means of preventing the Mischief contrived: It is not to be doubted, but, in the Commission of the Assembly, and among the Ministers without, there were men of various Sentiments, some a∣gainst, and some for the Union; But their Wisdom was particu∣larly seen in this, that however they differed in the debating things, they always concurr'd in every publick Act of the Commission, and made no Division for nor against it.</P>
<P>We find but one Protest in the whole Affair, which was in the Case of the Representation and Petition; and this began among the Ruling Elders, and continued there; for none of the Mi∣nisters ever adhered to that Protest, but even those that were against some parts of the Representation, yet, seeing themselves out-voted, acquiesc'd; Nor was all the Representation objected against by any Body;—It was a Paper, I doubt nor, some hoped to draw Mischief from, yet that Mischief had its Disappointment effectual∣ly, tho the Paper had its Success, in being carryed on; for it ap∣peased the Minds of many, who, being satisfied of having Exone∣rated their Conscience, acquiese'd in other Cases with the more Free∣dom; Nor was the Representation in general without its Particular Reasons to be assigned for it, as is further express'd in the Sequel of the Story: As to the Ministers in all other Cases, how warmly soever they debated, and with whatsoever Firmness the several Ministers adhered to their Opinions, yet they submitted their Votes to the Plurality, and all things were carryed in a regu∣lar and orderly way, to the great Disappointment of their Enemies, and to the great Ease and Satisfaction of all good Men of every Opinion.</P>
<P>Nor should I do Justice here to particular Persons, if I did not acknowledge, and record it to his Honour, That much of this is justly due to the Prudence, Patience and Temper of the Reverend Moderator Mr. <HI>William Wishart,</HI> then Minister of <HI>Leith,</HI> who was Moderator of the Assmbly, and also of the Commission, and who
<PB N="54" REF="265"/>
acted the true Moderator in all these Disputes wisely, Calming, Tempering, and with Difficulty enough, Reducing the warmest Debates to a Method of Conclusion;—And I must owne, he had a Task of no small Difficulty, tho he had, no doubt, the Con∣currence and Assistance of the Men of most Candor, Temper and Judgment on either side, since it could not but be visible to every Thinking Man, who had any Concern for the Good of the Church, that, to run any Differences up to a Head, could issue in nothing but the utmost Confusion, gratifie the Enemy, grieve all Good Chri∣stians, and in the end ruine the Peace of the Church.</P>
<P>And this Remark of mine is the more just, in that I could not but observe, that the Debates on these Affairs had sometimes that unhappy Warmth, that they seem'd to tend necessarily to a Breach; and to come to the very point, and Lookers on, of whom I was one <HI>with a sad Heart,</HI> expected something Fatal, not to the Union only, but to the whole Church, must unavoidably have follow'd every Debate;—and yet we always found cooler Thoughts pre∣vailed, and wise Men yielding this way and that, continually main∣tained a Harmony, in concluding what ever there was in debating.</P>
<P>Another piece of Conduct was very Instrumental to preserving the publick Tranquillity, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Ministers generally speak∣ing, kept these Debates out of the Pulpit; For tho all manner of Society was taken up with Disputes of the grand Affair, the Pulpit was very free of it; I say, generally speaking, what Indiscretions there were, had not Influence enough on the rest, to recommend the Example;—Particularly, I think it was a very great Wisdom in those Ministers, who were for the Union, and who had many Prompters to it, had the Government to countenance them in it, and Enemies enough to catch at it, if they had; I say, it was their Wisdom that they forbore it;—And I think these happy Conse∣quences followed to prove it so.</P>
<P N="1">1. It took away all pretence from those People, who designed, in this unhappy Game, to play one part of the Church against the other, and set up one side against the other more effectually.</P>
<P N="2">2. It took away the Ground of Pulpit Clamour, and kept those People silent, who, had it once begun there, would have been loudest by far in the Exclamation;—For, had one Party first preached for it, the other would, of Course, have preached against it, and so the Pulpit been made a meer Stage of Contention.</P>
<P>But, on both sides, the Ministers, as well on private as publick Days, let it generally alone; They prayed for Direction and Bles∣sing on the Parliament, and on the Meeting of the Ministers, as transacting difficult and doubtful Cases, but avoided entring into Debates.</P>
<P>I think I do them nothing but Justice therefore, in hinting, that the Temper and Calmness, with which the Generality of the Mini∣sters behaved in this nice Occasion, was very great, and contribut∣ed very much to the quiet carrying on the great Work.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="266"/>
Soon after this, the Country Tumults came upon the Stage; and, as it was <HI>a Peculiar</HI> to this Treaty, that the very Methods taken to ruine it, concurred to press it forward; so these Tumults served to open the Eyes, and calm the Spirits of abundance of those honest People, who were prejudiced before; who, tho they were willing to oppose the Union, as what did not correspond with their Opi∣nions, and as they thought with the publick Good; yet, when they saw it going to Arms, Rebellion, and Blood; and when they saw <HI>this farther,</HI> that, in order to oppose this National Conjuncti∣on, they were to joyn in a Civil War against their Governours, with their and the Nations known Enemies; Their Eyes began to open, and they slackned very much, from that time, their Appearance against the Treaty.</P>
<P>This manifestly shewed the difference between the Men, who, in the Singleness of their Hearts, opposed it, as apprehending it un∣safe for the establish'd Church, and inconsistent with their National Engagements; and those, on the other Hand, who opposed it, as contrary and fatal to the Popish Succession of <HI>James</HI> VIII, as they called him, and the Episcopal Hierarchy:—And these differed just as the <HI>Two Harlots</HI> in <HI>Solomons</HI> time;—The true Mother of the Child chose to lose her Possession of him, rather than that the Child should be murthered; so these faithful Friends to their Coun∣try, however possessed against the Union by the publick Clamour; yet they would choose to suffer the Inconveniencies they feared, ra∣ther than see their Country involved in Blood, a Civil War break∣ing out in the Bowels of the Kingdom, and Forreign Popish, or Ty∣rannical Powers invading their Privileges, and pulling down all before them.</P>
<P>This will appear to be the Case, in the farther pursuit of the Sto∣ry; and the sight of this affected the Hearts of a great many of those, who had any Compassion for their Country; and from this time forward, the Commission met with less Disturbance from the hot People on these Heads, but went on calmly, and with all the Temper and Moderation that could be expected.</P>
<P>The Letter from the Presbytery of <HI>Hamilton</HI> gave them some little Disturbance, but it was soon over; and their Circular Letter to Presbyteries, to endeavour to preserve the publick Peace, not only shewed their own Resolution to keep all quiet and peaceable, but discouraged all Endeavours afterward to disorder them: Of which by it self.—</P>
<P>But things were now grown to a strange Height; and the same Engines, who so boasted of the Effects of the Representation and Petition above said, shewed themselves not idle in their Manage∣ment of Affairs abroad; for they carryed on the Discontents of the People to all possible Height.</P>
<P>And indeed the Case of the poor common People of <HI>Scotland</HI> was very hard, in respect to their Share in these Matters; They are not the only common People in the World, who take Things by whole Sale; and who being inflamed with the Clamours and Ar∣guments
<PB N="56" REF="267"/>
of the more knowing sort, their Land-Lords, Leaders, Heads of Families, and, <HI>as they too properly call them, MASTERS,</HI> and alarmed with Out-cries of Dangers, and Distresses; which were to come upon them by the Union; Things which they could not Answer, nor had any Reason to question the Truth of, seeing their great Men possessed with the Belief of them: 'Tis no wonder they were exasperated to the highest Degree, and ready to attempt any thing, to save themselves from the Destruction at Hand.</P>
<P>Again, they were not altogether the People, that were disagree∣able to them neither, from whom these Discontents began; Had they been only the Episcopal, or <HI>Jacobite,</HI> or Popish Party, that had started these Things, a short Answer would have opened the Eyes of the common People; and it had sufficed to tell them, from whom their Objections came.</P>
<P>But when, by the Subtilty and Artifice of these Men, they had drawn in a great many of the Honest Well-meaning People of the Country, who were known to be well affected to the present Civil Establishment of the Nation, and zealous for its Religious Establish∣ment; when these were seen among the Number of the Warm Op∣posers of the Union, shaking their Heads at the Articles, and fright∣ed at the terrible Consequences, which were talk'd of;—Who can wonder, that the rest of the People began to be uneasy, and that those Uneasinesses, at last, broke out into Excesses, Madness, and Distraction.</P>
<P>The People of <HI>Scotland,</HI> I say, are not the first Instance; How easily it is to be imposed upon; and how readily a Mob is raised by a Rumour. How soon did the <HI>Jews</HI> of <HI>Asia</HI> put all <HI>Jerusalem</HI> in an Uproar, when they made them believe their Worship was in Danger by <HI>Paul</HI>'s Preaching; and that he not only invaded their Worship, but had actually defiled the Temple. How readily did they lay hold of the Blessed Apostle, and had certainly Murdered him, if the Civil Authority had not, <HI>assisted by the Military,</HI> rescu∣ed him out of the Hands of the Mob, and put the Case in the way of a fair Hearing.</P>
<P>It was not for the poor People, to distinguish the Original of Causes and Things, nor who was at the Bottom of these Rumours; it was not for them to distinguish the Hand of <HI>Joab</HI> in all this; whether <HI>Jacobite</HI> or Papist was the Original of this Matter, was not for them to examine; They saw their Superiors joyning in the same Complaint, and every Party saw some of their respective Chiefs embark'd.</P>
<P>The common People could look no further; The Episcopal Poor saw their Curates Tooth and Nail against it; The Ignorant and Indifferent Poor, saw their <HI>Jacobite</HI> Land-Lords and Masters Railing at it; and which was worse still, the Honest Presbyterian poor People saw some of their Gentlemen, and such as they had remarked and noticed <HI>to be Hearty Presbyterians,</HI> yet appearing a∣gainst it;—Who then can censure the poor depending, uninfor∣med and abused People?</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="268"/>
And how, but by these concurring Accidents, was it possible, the poor deluded People of <HI>Glasgow,</HI> and the West, could be drawn in∣to Mobs and Tumults, in Gratification of that very Party, to whom they have been the very Antipodes, the Reverse, even in all the Ages of the Reformation: By whom they had been Plundered, Rifled, Butchered, and Persecuted, in the most Barbarous Manner, with Cruelties and Extravagancies innumerable; Will any Man say, the Men of <HI>Glasgow,</HI> Famous for their Zeal in Religion, and the Liberties of their Country, even from the very Infancy of the Reformation, were now turned Enemies to the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and ready to Fight against her, in the Quarrel of their Bloody and Inveterate Enemies, the Papists and <HI>Jacobites?</HI> It could not be.</P>
<P>Will any Man suggest, That <HI>Glasgow</HI> had forgotten her self so much, that the Blood of her Citizens and Inhabitants, shed in the old Articles of <HI>Pentland,</HI> and <HI>Bothwell,</HI> and the Ravages made up∣on her, and the Countries round her, after those Unhappy Times, even to the Confines of the Revolution, were forgotten?—Will any Body think, the <HI>Glasgow</HI> Men had so far forgot the History of Twenty Years ago only, that they could now joyn with the Mur∣derers of their Brethren and Fathers, and take up Arms in favour of their Mortal Enemies? No, No, Nothing less, It was all Delu∣sion and meer Artifice, the Party played the Presbyterian against the Presbyterian, the <HI>Williamite</HI> against the <HI>Williamite;</HI> and hav∣ing subtilly possess'd a few Honest, but Deluded People, with the Frenzy of the Time, made them the Tools of their Projects, if pos∣sible, to bring them to pull down one another, that they might af∣terwards, with the more Ease, devour them both.—</P>
<P>And this leads me of Course into the Story of the <HI>Glasgow</HI> Rabble, which now came upon the Stage; and which, in its Turn, tho raised with a differing Design, was one of the Proofs of GODs Providence, working every thing, <HI>howsoever pointed at the Ʋnion,</HI> to Act for it, and further its Conclusion.</P>
<P>They had had in <HI>Edinburgh</HI> continual Alarms of the Rising of the People in the West and North parts, in order, by Force, to put an end to the Treaty, tho the People themselves knew nothing of it, nor had any such Design: To day it was in <HI>Angus,</HI> to mor∣row in <HI>Galloway,</HI> now at <HI>Stirling,</HI> then at <HI>Lanerk,</HI> then at <HI>Hamil∣ton,</HI> then at <HI>Glasgow,</HI> but nothing yet appeared; and some began to mock these Fears as groundless:—The Party made their different Uses of the Reports, to day enlarge them to terrify and amuse, to morrow lessen them again as meer Rumours, to lessen the Watchfulness of the Government, and make them secure; but the Design was manifestly to procure the Tumults they expected, by reporting they were begun.</P>
<P>That these Fears were not groundless, or those Alarms meer <HI>Chi∣mera's,</HI> may be seen by the Commission of the Kirks Circular Letters to the several Presbyteries, to desire them to keep the Peace, and to be earnest to prevent such Tumults; To which the Presbytery of <HI>Ha∣milton</HI>
<PB N="58" REF="269"/>
gave an Answer, which seemed to object against those Fears as unjust, tho it did not afterwards appear so. <HI>Vide</HI> the <HI>Appendix, N. M.</HI></P>
<P>And now, tho in the Story of the <HI>Glasgow</HI> Rabble, I shall be obliged to mention the unhappy Slip in those Prudentials, which, as I have observed, the Ministers, <HI>generally speaking,</HI> behaved with;—I shall not, however, offend any Person of common Charity, since I shall be far from saying, the Gentleman here did this with a Design to raise the Tumult that followed; much less would I so much as suspect, that he could, in the least, have it in his Thoughts, to gratify the Folly and projected Destruction of the Kirk of <HI>Scot∣land,</HI> which, in all these things, was apparent enough in the se∣cret Party that pushed on these things.</P>
<P>As to the Rashness and Intemperate Zeal, or <HI>whatever other mista∣ken Foundation it had,</HI> producing the Heat and Warmth of the Ex∣pression, I have the Charity to believe, he is convinced of the Er∣ror of that; and so, while I am obliged to repeat the Circumstance, I shall, as little as possible, reflect upon the Person, being desirous, in all Cases, rather to Cover than Expose the Undesigning Failures of all Honest Men, as what they may be led into by Mistake, but never prosecute, when their Judgments are better Informed.</P>
<P>But to come to the particulars of this Unhappy Story at <HI>Glasgow,</HI> which I shall relate with all the Impartiality possible, and without Respect of Persons, both for the sake of the History, which 'tis ne∣cessary to Transmit faithfully to Posterity; as also, for setting things in a true Light, and placing the Guilt where it is justly due, which, at present, is understood to the prejudice of that City in general; and of those Honest Gentlemen among the Inhabitants, who had no Concern in it, unless it were to be Insulted and made Uneasy by it.</P>
<P>The first Uneasiness that I meet with among the People here, I mean that was particular, <HI>for the general Ʋneasinesses about the Treaty were visible every where, as I have hinted already,</HI> was about Addres∣sing.</P>
<P>Great had been the Endeavours of a Party of Men, all over the Kingdom, to bring in numerous Addresses to the Parliament against the Treaty, in order to fortify that Argument, which was now brought in, as a strong Bar against the immediat Proceeding, <HI>viz.</HI> That it was against the general Inclination of the People; which you will find Moved in the House, upon the second Reading of the first Article, as <HI>per</HI> the Minuts.</P>
<P>The Party at <HI>Glasgow</HI> had been very busy to perswade the Magi∣strates to Address, as the other Royal Burghs had <HI>many of them</HI> done; but the Magistrates shewing no Inclination to it, they found there was no way to bring it about, but by the common People.</P>
<P>Nor could all their Credit with the common People bring it to pass; the Instruments being chiefly <HI>Jacobites,</HI> Papists, and Episcopal Peo∣ple, whose Reputation and Interest in the City of <HI>Glasgow,</HI> and parts adjacent, had always been but very low, and now lower than
<PB N="59" REF="270" MS="y"/>
ever; so that, to effect their Design, they had Recourse to the Po∣licy of the Times, <HI>viz.</HI> Deluding and Imposing upon others, and this did their Work; for, had they not made use of some weaker Brethren, who had more Influence upon the People, they had never brought it to pass.</P>
<P>To bring in some of these, all the Popular Arguments mention∣ed before were Improved; among others, the Danger of the Kirk of <HI>Scotland,</HI> I believe I may say <HI>in their favour,</HI> was not the least.</P>
<P>Drawn in by these specious Pretences, the <HI>Jacobite</HI> Party had the Pleasure to ly by, and see their Work done to their Hand; and the People being sufficiently Enflamed, they waited the Issue, when one Unhappy Indiscretion, <HI>to say no worse of it,</HI> finished all their Hopes, and brought to pass the Mischief they designed, in the best manner for them they could have wished for.</P>
<P>Some of the Elders of the Church had privatly waited on the Provost, whether moved by their Minister, or by the common People, or of their own Heads, I shall not determine, tho 'tis not very diffi∣cult to Trace it to its beginning; but 'tis apparent, the Minister we are to mention, as well as some others in the Town, were very ear∣nest for the thing; Their Business was, it seems, to move the Pro∣vost, that an Address might be pretented to the Parliament against the Union; They might have commanded a Popular Address among themselves, but that was not what they desired, but an Address in the Name of the City by the Provost, Baillies, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The Provost answered <HI>to this purpose,</HI> That he did not think it would be prudent for them to Address at this time, that he had been at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and had consulted the Lord Advocat, and some of the City of <HI>Glasgows</HI> best Friends, and all unanimously advised them a∣gainst it, and gave it as their Opinion, it was not their Interest to do it: Particularly he reminded them, the Parliament had but, the last Session, granted them the Tax of Two Pennies the Pint; and if they should now appear as a Town in this Address, it might urge them to Repeal their Grant, and the City might be a great Sufferer.</P>
<P>This was a very good Reason, why he should decline the Address, if the Gentlemen had been in a Condition to hearken to Reason; for if the Magistrates had Addressed, they must also have followed it with Reasons and Arguments openly as a Body, which, in such Case, would have been, in all Probability, ill taken by the Parliament, if, <HI>as is very likely,</HI> those Reasons had been such, as came in from other places, peremptorily Inhibiting their Proceedings, and Im∣peaching <HI>their Power to Act,</HI> without Leave from their Constituents, which indeed was the thing now insisted upon, and generally aimed at in the Project of Addressing.</P>
<P>The Provost having thus, tho very calmly and respectfully, de∣clined the Matter, the People appeared very uneasy, and some hot Expressions had been let fall in Discourse about the Town, That they would have an Address one way or other; But one Unhap∣py Accident soon discovered the Meaning of the whole.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="271"/>
On <HI>Thursday</HI> the {left blank} day of {left blank} the Fast appointed by the Commission of the Assembly was kept in <HI>Glasgow,</HI> Mr. <HI>C—k</HI> Minister of the Trone Kirk Preached from the Words in <HI>Ezra</HI> 8. 21. <HI>And I proclaimed a Fast at the River of</HI> AHAVA, <HI>that we might afflict our selves before our GOD, to seek of Him a right Way for us, and for our little Ones, and for all our Substance.</HI></P>
<P>I shall convince the Gentleman concerned, that this Account is not made for a Satyr upon him, 'tis too serious a Subject; and when both he, and those who heard him, reflects on, how much more his Unhappy Temper, at that time, forc'd from him, than I set down here, all which I have by me <HI>verbatim,</HI> as he spoke it, he will, I say, be convinced, that I talk no more, than, in the Obligation of a Historian to Truth of Fact, I am bound to do.</P>
<P>In the Conclusion of his Sermon, after telling his Hearers the sad Condition they were brought to, and how forward <HI>Glasgow</HI> used to be in the Honest Cause, he added to this purpose, <Q>Addresses would not do, and Prayers would not do, there must be other Methods; 'Tis true Prayer was a Duty, but we must not rest there,—</Q> and closed it with these Words, <Q>Wherefore up, and be Valiant for the City of our GOD.</Q></P>
<P>I am not at all apprehensive of having the Truth of these Words questioned, having received them from the Mouths of more than two or three of the principal Inhabitants of <HI>Glasgow,</HI> who heard them spoken; and if the misplacing a Word should be snatcht at, <HI>I venture to say,</HI> that this was the full Purport of the Expression, without the least Variation; as to the Weak Good Man that spoke them, I will not suggest, that he foresaw the Consequence of them, or had any such thing in his Design, tho it calls for some Charity to guess his Meaning; The kindest thing I can say of them, is, that he did not mean at all what followed, but spoke in his Haste; for GOD forbid I should suggest he mean'd to raise a Rebellion, and to bring his Country into all that Blood and Confusion, which, if GODs Goodness had not prevented it, had certainly followed.</P>
<P>The Sermon ended about eleven a Clock, and the People were so Enflamed before, that, by one of the Clock, the Mob were gotten together, their Drum was Beat in the Back-streets, and all the Con∣fusions we are now to speak of followed.</P>
<P>The next day, the Deacons of the Trades, <HI>which is the same as in</HI> London, <HI>the Masters of the Companies,</HI> followed with a meddling Number of <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">By Tradesmen in <HI>Scotland</HI> is understood none but the meaner sort of People, such as Shoemakers, Smiths, Butchers, Weavers, and the like, as in <HI>England</HI> are called Handycrafts, the Shop-Keepers, such as Mercers, Drapers, Grocers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are all called Merchants.</NOTE> Tradesmen, came to <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">A Chamber in the Tolbooth, where the Magistrates sit, and where the City Council assembles, and where the Provost generally is eve∣ry Morning.</NOTE> the Council-House, and
<PB N="61" REF="272"/>
leaving the People below, the Deacons of Trades and some few went up to the Provost, and demanded of him very rudely, if he would Address.</P>
<P>The Provost, tho surprized with their manner, composed himself, and, according to his known Calmness and Steadiness of Temper, told them, that he was not satisfied to Address; and an Eminent Inhabitant of the Town, <HI>viz.</HI> The Laird of <HI>Blackhouse,</HI> used a great many Arguments with them, civilly to perswade them to be easy and satisfied, and not to promote any Disorders in the City.</P>
<P>While they were thus Discoursing in the Town-House, the Num∣ber of the People encreased without, and began to be Tumultuous; but as soon as the Deacons came out, and Reported to them in short, that the Provost had refused to Address, the People fell a Shouting, and Raging, and Throwing Stones, and Raised a very great Uproar.</P>
<P>And here the Deacons deservedly obtain the Title of the Raisers of this Rabble; for, had they related the Calmness, the Reason∣ings, and the Manner, with which the Provost very discreetly An∣swered them, the People might very easily have been quietly dis∣missed; but now it was too late, the Answer, as it was given to them, was only in gross, that the Provost was Resolute, and would not Address.</P>
<P>Enraged thus, they slung Stones at the Windows, and, as much as they could, Insulted the Provost; but he found Means to with∣draw, so that they could not hurt him for that time.</P>
<P>In this Rage, they went directly to the Provosts House, got into it, took away all his Arms, which were about twenty five Musquets, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Some few things were stollen in the Throng, but that was not much: From thence they went to the Laird of <HI>Blackhouse</HI>'s Dwelling, broke his Windows, and shewed their Teeth, and thus the first Tumult ended.</P>
<P>The Provost retired for a while out of Town, and the Laird of <HI>Blackhouse</HI> also, not knowing what the Issue of these things might be.</P>
<P>I pay no Complement at all here, but a Debt to Truth, in not∣ing, that the Provost of <HI>Glasgow</HI> for that time, <HI>{left blank} Aird</HI> Esquire, was an Honest, Sober, Discreet Gentleman, one that had always been exceedingly Beloved, even by the common People, particular∣ly for his Care of, and Charity to the Poor of the Town; and, at another time, would have been the last Man in the Town they would have Insulted.</P>
<P>I mention this to obviate the Supposition, that the Rabble took this Occasion to Insult him, upon former Resentments, as has been usual in like Cases.</P>
<P>The Provost being withdrawn, and the Address they designed thus baulk'd.</P>
<P>They set it on Foot without him, and indeed they effectually An∣swered the Magistrates Desire, who resolved, if there was an Ad∣dress, it should be a meer Mob Address.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="273"/>
Many a mean Step they took to get Hands, by Threatning, Af∣frighting, and Hurrying People into it, Taking Youths and meer Childrens Hands to it.</P>
<P>Every Man that refused to sign it, was Threatned to be Rabbled, and have his House Plundered, which made a great many Timorous People sign it, that did not approve of it.</P>
<P>This being the Method, it may easily be imagined, the Address was not many days a finishing; and such as it was, they sent it away by four of the Townsmen, whereof the first two <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Robert Scot Deacon of the Taylors, <HI>{left blank} Stevenson</HI> Dea∣con of the Shoemakers, <HI>John Bowman</HI> Dean of Guild, and <HI>John Ha∣milton</HI> Gentleman, were the Four that went up to the Parliament with the Address.</NOTE> were the Deacon of the Taylors, and the Deacon of the Shoemakers; The other two that went with it were Gentlemen, too well known to be suspected of desiring any such kind of Tumultuous Proceed∣ings, but complyed with their Desire, in order to prevent worse Consequences.</P>
<P>If the Multitude of Addresses, which have been boasted of, as a Declaration of the Aversion of the People to the Union, may be guess'd at by this, those Gentlemen, who bring this as an Argu∣ment, have small Reason to Boast, and need not be very Forward, to have the Particulars Examined into.</P>
<P>The Address having thus been signed, and sent away, the Peo∣ple begun to be quiet again, and the Tumults seemed to have an end; The Provost, who had fled to <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> came home again, and every one went quietly about their Business, till, a little while after, a new Occasion set all in a Flame again, worse than it was before, and made it appear, who was at the Bottom of it all.</P>
<P>And here the Warm Gentleman, who, from the Pulpit put the Match to this Gun Powder, may see who laid the Train;—The Triffle of Addressing was the least thing they sought for, tho that served a purpose also;—And these good People, who were drawn in to begin it, saw no farther; but now it appeared to be all <HI>Jacobite</HI> and Papist at the Bottom; That Blood and Confusion was the thing they drove at, and King <HI>James,</HI> Prelacy, Tyranny, Popery, and all the Mischiefs this Nation has to fear from them, lay hid in the Design, as will presently appear, and the poor Thought∣less Multitude were only Hurryed into it, by a Conjunction of Mi∣stakes.</P>
<P>The second Rabble had a Beginning as small as the first, tho not so soon laid, because the first had only the Address in View, and was managed by a few, that the Contrivers of those Disorders had Imposed upon, and Deluded; but this part was under the more immediat Conduct of the very Party themselves, and was intro∣duced as follows.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="274"/>
One of the Magistrates <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">It was Baillie <HI>Hamilton.</HI></NOTE> of the City, had committed a <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">The Fellows Name was <HI>Parker,</HI> a Loose, Vagabond, Profligate Fellow, of a very ill Character, a Spinner of Tobacco by Imployment, but a very Scandalous Person.</NOTE> Fellow to the Tolbooth for Theft;—He had, it seems, been taken offering to Sale a Musquet, or some other things, which, it was made appear, belonged to the Provost of the City, and which was taken out of his House in the time of the Rabble above-men∣tioned.</P>
<P>This Fellow lay in the Tolbooth for some time; but it was ob∣served, that, in an Evening, there would be several of the common People at the Window, talking to him thro' the Grates of the Pri∣son;—The Provost apprehending, that the Imprisonment of this Fellow, might be a Pretence for a new Disturbance, resolved to discharge him; but, that it might not seem to be done for Fear, took a <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">This is called there a Bond of Presentation, and is all one with a simple Recognizance without Bail.</NOTE> Bond of him, to appear again, when called for, and, among the rest of the People, who came to talk with him at the Grate, was one <HI>Finlay,</HI> a loose sort of a Fellow, who had formerly been a Sergeant in <HI>Dumbartons</HI> Regiment in <HI>Flanders,</HI> and who openly professed himself a <HI>Jacobite,</HI> a Fellow that followed no Em∣ploy, but his Mother kept a little <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">The common Name for an Ale House, or Inn, in that Country.</NOTE> Change House at the re∣motest part of the Town on the <HI>Edinburgh</HI> side.</P>
<P>The Fellow had given his Comrades an Account, that the Magi∣strates had taken a Bond of him; and the next Morning, this <HI>Fin∣lay,</HI> and a Rabble with him, comes up to the Clerks Chamber, another Office in the <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">The Town House, in which is their Offices, and also the Prison for the City; It is generally like the Guild Hall of a City, or the Town House in <HI>England,</HI> saving that the Prison is generally in the same House in <HI>Scotland.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Tolbooth,</HI> where the Magistrates meet, and there they demand this Bond of the Clerk, it being put into his Hands.</P>
<P>The Magistrates willing to take away all Occasions of Tumult, and to leave them no Excuse, ordered the Bond to be delivered up, for the Gentlemen Rabble had now the full Command of the Town.</P>
<P>But to let it be seen, that these were but seeking Occasions, not∣withstanding the Provost had told them, they should have the Bond delivered up; and they had now no Reason but to be satisfied, the Clerk having Orders to deliver it; They continued together, re∣solving to Insult the Provost, at his coming out.</P>
<P>The Provost not imagining any Danger, having granted their Request, comes innocently out of the Tolbooth, and went toward his own House; The Rabble immediatly gathered about him,
<PB N="64" REF="275"/>
Thrusting and Abusing him, and not with Villainous Language only, but with Stones and Dirt, and such like thrown at him.</P>
<P>He would have made to his own House, but the Multitude increas∣ing, and growing Furious, he took Sanctuary in a House, and run∣ning up a Stair Case, lost the Rabble for some time, they pursuing him into a wrong House; However, they searched every Apart∣ment to the Top of the Stair, and came into the very Room where he was; But the same Hand that smote the Men of <HI>Sodom</HI> with Blindness, when they would have Rabbled the Angels, protected him from this many Headed Monster, and so Blinded them, that they could not find him: It is the Opinion of many of the Sober∣est and most Judicious of the Citizens, that, if they had found him, their Fury was, at that time, so past all Government, that they would have Murdered him, and that in a manner Barbarous enough; and if they had, as we say of a Bull Dog, once but Tasted Blood, who knows where they would have ended?</P>
<P>The Provost was hid in a Bed, which folded up against the Wall, and which they never thought of taking down;—Having escap∣ed this eminent Danger, he was conveyed out of Town the next day by his Friends, and went for the second time to <HI>Edinburgh.</HI></P>
<P>The Rabble was now fully Master of the Town, they ranged the Streets, and did what they pleased; No Magistrate durst show his Face to them, they challenged People as they walk'd the Streets with this Question, <HI>Are you for the Ʋnion?</HI> And no Man durst owne it, but at their extremest Hazard.</P>
<P>The next thing they did, was to search for Arms in all the Hou∣ses of those, that had appeared for the Union; And first they went to the Dean of Guild, and, upon his refusing to give them his Arms, they took them away by Force; They stopt here a little, but having given out, that they would search the Houses of all that were for the Union, the Magistrates Assembled, and Consider∣ing, that, if the Citizens were Disarmed, and the Rabble possest of their Weapons, they might, in the next place, possess their Houses, Wives and Wealth, at their Command; and that it was better to Defend themselves now, than be Murdered and Plunder∣ed in cold Blood; They resolved therefore to raise some Strength, to oppose this Violence, and accordingly ordered the Town Guards to be doubled that Night, and removed the place of Arms from the usual Guard House to the Tolbooth;—And that this Guard should be of Select Persons, such as they knew.</P>
<P>Accordingly Orders were sent to all the Captains of the City Militia, that each of them should bring twelve Men with them, such as, they could depend upon, would stand by them, to secure the Peace of the City; and this was besides the ordinary Guard.</P>
<P>This was done readily, and with great Secrecy and Celerity, the Captains of the Militia being Faithful Honest Gentlemen, brought their Men without any Noise, Beat of Drum, or the like, and leav∣ing
<PB N="65" REF="276"/>
the ordinary Guard at the usual <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">The usual Place for the Guard of the Town is in the <HI>Trone-Gate</HI> Street.</NOTE> place, and were that Night encreased to a whole Company, and this Select Guard was plac'd in the <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">In the Tolbooth one Pair of Stairs high.</NOTE> Council-Chamber.</P>
<P>The Rabble, who had resolved to be as good as their Words, were now gotten together; and whether they thought the Magi∣strates were met in the Council-Chamber, and so they resolved to begin with them; or whether they had Intelligence, that they were upon their Guard, is not certain; but about nine a Clock at Night they gathered about the Tolbooth, and seeing a Centinel plac'd at the Top of the <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">The Stone Steps on the Out side where the Iron Rails are, and where the Officers stand to read Proclamations or any Publick Acts.</NOTE> Stair, <HI>Finlay,</HI> of whom before, is or∣dered to go up, and see what they were a doing, as he called it.</P>
<P>When he came to the Top of the Stair, the Centinel challeng'd him, and thrust him back; but he comes on again, and thrusts in with the Centinel, and gets by him.</P>
<P>At this Juncture, one of the Citizens, who was privately appoint∣ed to meet as above, was just coming up; and having pass'd as privately as he could thro' the Mob, who were at the Stair Foot to the Number of about 100, being a Select Party only, for the rest were not then got together, was going up the Stairs; This Gentle∣man seeing a Fellow assault the Centinel, boldly stept up to him, and knockt him down on the Stair Head with the Butt End of his Musquet, and immediately calls the Guard.</P>
<P>The Guard immediately took to their Arms, and headed by one Lieutenant <HI>Lindsay</HI> an old Soldier of King <HI>William</HI>'s, but now a Burgess and Inhabitant of the City, they came down and drew up at the Foot of the Stair.</P>
<P>Some Pieces were Fired in the Street, but whether at the Guard or no, was not known; The Multitude was great by this Time, and being late at Night, it could not well be discern'd: But as they had all the Reason in the World to expect it, they fell reso∣lutely to Work with them, and Sallying upon the Rabble, they im∣mediately fled and dispers'd.</P>
<P>Having thus broke the first Body of them, it was observ'd, that they only fled from the immediate Shock, but stood in Throngs under the <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">The new Buildings at the Cross have small Piazzas of Stone on both Sides, under which the Shops are, and the People may walk in wet Weather.</NOTE> Piazzas, and in the Heads of Closses <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Closses are the same with By-Lanes or Alleys.</NOTE>, to see what the Guard would do; and that, with one Hallow, they could all be together again in a Moment, whereupon a Party was ordered down <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">There are but four principal Streets which all meet at the Cross, and lead to the four Gates of the City.</NOTE> every Street to clear the Piazzas and Closses, and see
<PB N="66" REF="277"/>
the Rabble effectually dispers'd, which they did, but were all the way assaulted from the Houses and out of the Closses with Curses and Stones; The former did not much Hurt except to the Givers, but the latter Wounded several of the Inhabitants, and some were very much hurt.</P>
<P>Had they been able to have renew'd this Guard, the Publick Peace had been maintain'd, and the whole Design of this Rabble disap∣pointed: But it is to be noted, these Gentlemen were all Citizens, Heads of Families, and of the principal Inhabitants; The Com∣monalty was universally debauch'd, and not to be trusted, and the Gentlemen could not do Duty every Night, neither had all that were Zealous enough against the Tumults, either Bodies to bear the Fatigue of Soldiers, or Hearts to adventure; and those that were Forwardest, could not be always in Arms:—This first Piece of Work was on <HI>Saturday</HI> Night, the next Night they re∣liev'd the Guard by the like Select Number, and all was quiet; for, while these Men appear'd, the Rabble durst not stir.</P>
<P>On <HI>Monday,</HI> the Magistrates Summoned the Town Council, and, sending for the Deacons of the Tradesmen, the thing proposed was, What Course should be taken to secure the Peace of the City, and keep the Magistrates and Inhabitants from Plunder and Insult.</P>
<P>The Deacons of Trades, subtilly, and as appear'd, designedly, at least such of them as were in the Design, proposed, That this Select Guard should be omitted, and pretended to promise, That, if any Tumult happened, they would come to the Town Guard with their Men to defend the City; which, whoever observes how well they performed, will think it no Breach of Charity, to say they never de∣signed it:—However, for this Week, there was no more Tumult, but the Mob reign'd Masters, and <HI>Finlay,</HI> who now had made himself one of their Leaders, set up a Guard at the Upper End of the Town near the Cathedral, as it were in Opposition to the Town Guard.</P>
<P>This whole Week was spent in Amusements, and raising Reports of the Rising of the People at <HI>Stirling,</HI> at <HI>Hamilton,</HI> and in <HI>Angus;</HI> and that a great Army of them was to Rendezvous at <HI>Hamilton,</HI> from whence they were to March to <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> to raise the Parlia∣ment: <HI>Finlay</HI> gives out, That he will March with all the Men of <HI>Glasgow</HI> to meet their Brethren at <HI>Hamilton</HI> on the same Design;—by whose Assistance all this was done, the Government was too Merciful to make a narrow Enquiry, and so I must leave it as they did in the dark: Having brought the Folly and Madness of the poor People to such a Height, <HI>Finlay</HI> actually gets together about 45 Men, or that was the most of the great Army he raised; and on the <HI>Friday</HI> following, this Contemptible Wretch having made himself their Gene∣ral, Marches out of the City with them for <HI>Hamilton;</HI> they were Armed with Musquets and Swords, such as they had taken out of the Ma∣gistrates Houses; and (wherever he procur'd it, for every one knows he had it not of his own) he Distributed to every Man a Dollar;—And thus in Arms against their Native Country, and the Pro∣testant Religion, these poor Deluded People March'd away, under the Command of an Abject Scondrel Wretch, that openly profess'd
<PB N="67" REF="278"/>
himself a <HI>Jacobite,</HI> and that, with his Good Will, would have seen all the Presbyterians in <HI>Scotland</HI> ruin'd.</P>
<P>But to such a Pass were Things now come, and who can Account for some Critical Junctures, in which Men may be brought to ruine themselves with their own Hands, and never suffer themselves to listen to the Cautions of their Friends.</P>
<P>The Town, tho' rid of <HI>Finlay</HI> and his Vanguard, enjoy'd not the more Peace, or were in less Danger, for the Mob that remain'd kept up their Guard, threaten'd yet worse things than had been done, and were afterward as good as their Words to a Title.</P>
<P>The Government, it may be supposed, were constantly acquaint∣ed with those things, and their Forbearance had not a little hearten∣ed up the Party that push'd these Mischiefs on; However, being loth to come to Extremities, they tryed Gentler Methods first, and the Lord High Commissioner having laid it before the Parliament, they immediately pass'd an Act, Discharging the Mustering of Troops in the Country during this Session, and a Proclamation was published against Tumults, and both these were sent to <HI>Glasgow</HI> to be published.</P>
<P>It should be noted here, That, by the Act of Security, any of the Nobility, Gentry, or Towns, might meet in Arms, Muster and Ex∣ercise their Fencible Men, and the like, upon any Occasion of which they were Judges; which was done in order to make the Militia of <HI>Scotland</HI> more Serviceable, or as some think <HI>in Terrorem</HI> to Serve a Cause; but be that as it will, it may remain undetermined; but, at this Juncture, the Parliament foresaw, it might be a Handle for the drawing together any Number of Men at such a Time as this, and might be dangerous to the Peace, wherefore they caused an Act to be brought in to Repeal that part of the Act of Security, for so long only as the present Parliament was sitting.</P>
<P>When this Act of Parliament and Proclamation came to Town, which was on the <HI>Monday</HI> after <HI>Finlay</HI>'s March, the Magistrates as∣sembled about ten in the Morning, and caused the Messenger that brought it to read it at the Cross; Accordingly the Messenger goes up to the <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">The Head of the Stone Stair on the Out-side of the Tolbooth just fronting the Cross, the same mentioned before where the Centinel stood.</NOTE> usual place, and read first the Act of Parliament, the Magistrates were below, and the Officers attending as usual, and a vast Multitude of People were got together to hear what it was, be∣fore the Officer had done, the People began to make a Noise, and throw Stones at him; but however, the Man went on, and read out the Act, and began the Proclamation against Tumults; but he had hardly read the Title of the Proclamation, when the Stones came so thick, there was no standing it, and the poor Fellow not a little Bruised was driven off the Stair.</P>
<P>Upon this the Magistrates ordered one of the Town Officers to go up and Read, which he did as far as he could, but was in like manner
<PB N="68" REF="279"/>
driven off by the Fury of the Stoning: In the <HI>Interim</HI> of this, the Magistrates had sent for the Town Guard to protect the second Officer in Reading; The Officer of the Guard seeing the other Officer abused thus before their Faces, commands his Men to fall upon the Rabble with the Clubs of their Musquets, which they did, and knockt down some of them; but the Tradesmen that were upon the Guard, in the very Action deserted, and refused to obey the Command of their Officers, which so encouraged the Rabble, that they came on again with Shouts and Huzza's, and with Volleys of Stones they fell upon the few of the Guard that were Faithful, and drove them off from the Street.</P>
<P>The Officer that commanded them Retreated them into the Guard House, but this was not a place to be defended against such a Mul∣titude, so in short they broke in upon them and disarm'd them, and well it was they came off without Blood,—some of them were very much Bruised with Stones.</P>
<P>The Rabble now flusht with Victory, were in a terrible Fury, and this was the most Outragious Part of the whole Tran∣saction; having disarm'd the Guard, the next thing was to Storm the Tolbooth, immediately they get Ladders to the Windows, and breaking in, they seize upon 250 Halberts which are the Towns Arms; with these upon their Shoulders in Rank and File they Rov'd about the Streets, and made their Rendezvous at the Old Castle where their Guard was kept; Here they gave out, That, in the Afternoon, they would come down and Plunder the Mer∣chants Houses, nay, and threatened their Lives too, which put the whole City in an Unspeakable Consternation.</P>
<P>Nor were they wanting in some part of their Threatened Execu∣tion, for about three in the Afternoon they Detach'd a Party of about twenty Men Arm'd, some with Musquets, some with Halberts, these, with a Drum before them, came to the Cross, and from thence took their March down the High Streets, breaking open the Doors and Houses of who ever they pleased, pretending to search for Arms, but Stole and Plundered whatever came in their way, and thus they continued till ten a Clock at Night.</P>
<P>They got not above thirty Musquets, with some Pistols and Swords, but the Terror of the Inhabitants is not to be express'd, who were oblig'd to bear this Violence without Complaint; This small Party was follow'd by a vast Throng of Boys and Idle Fellows like themselves, which encreased the Fright of the Citizens.—</P>
<P>Having thus Ranged the City at Pleasure till about ten a Clock at Night, they March'd away with the Spoil of their Masters up to their Main Guard, from thence they Beat their Tatoo round the Town like a Garison; and indeed they were no less, for they had the City in their full Possession, and every Bodies Life and Goods at their Mercy.</P>
<P>Their Rudeness in this pretended Search for Arms is not to be de∣scribed, and had they met with any Opposition, no doubt it would have been worse; They came into the Rooms where Persons that lay Sick were just Dying, and put all things into inexpressible Con∣fusion;
<PB N="69" REF="280"/>
They came into Chambers, where Women were Lying in, and Barbarously made them Rise, pretending to Search under their Beds for Arms: In short, except that there was no Blood shed, they acted the exact part of an Enraged Ungoverned Multitude.</P>
<P>But, to return to their Army of Fourty Five, which was all this while on its March; And were advanc'd as far as <HI>Kilsyth,</HI> on their Way to <HI>Edinburgh.</HI></P>
<P>The Government, who had an exact Account of all these things, and who had tryed all the Gentle Methods of Proclamations, Acts of Parliament, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Finding to what Height Things were brought, and that nothing but Force could Remedy Them, prepar'd to be before-hand with these Forward Gentlemen; And having an Account both of their March and Number, The Lord Commissio∣ner ordered a Detachment of Dragoons, joyn'd with some Horse Granadeers of the Guard, under the Command of Colonel <HI>Campbell,</HI> Uncle to the Duke of <HI>Argyll,</HI> to March with all Expedition for <HI>Glasgow.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Finlay,</HI> in the mean time being at <HI>Kilsyth,</HI> has Notice of the March of these Dragoons, within a few Hours after his Arrival there; And hearing no News of the great Parties of 5 and 6000, which he had perswaded his Men would meet him there; And being alarm'd at the News of the Dragoons he sends back—<HI>Campbell,</HI> another of the Ring-Leaders of his Rabble, to bring up the second Body which was to be ready to fol∣low, and which were Reported to be 400, <HI>but they Thank'd him, and Stay'd at Home;</HI> And with the rest he March'd to <HI>Hamilton,</HI> where he Arriv'd on <HI>Sunday</HI> about Noon, the third day after his March from <HI>Glasgow.</HI></P>
<P>Here he Quartered his Army that Night, and finding, as before, none of the Friends that were to Assemble from all Parts, nor no News of them, he bestow'd a Volley of Curses upon them, and Marches directly back to <HI>Glasgow,</HI> where he Arriv'd, to the no small Mortification of his Fellows, on <HI>Wednesday,</HI> the next day but one after the Plunderings I have related before; They had Halted at <HI>Rugland,</HI> a Burgh about two Miles from <HI>Glasgow,</HI> where, as I sup∣pose, they called a Council of War among themselves; but, be∣ing all Voters, they Agreed upon nothing, but to March Home, which accordingly they did; and, in Order of Battel, enter'd the City, and March'd directly up to their Main Guard aforesaid: Here they made, <HI>says my Author,</HI> their Rendezvous, having not thought fit to keep the Field any longer.</P>
<P>And now they began to think a little, for I cannot allow my self to say they had done it before; Their Danger began now to show it self, and to stare in their Faces a little; They began to consider what they had been doing with others, and what was now like to be do∣ing with them; They had no more Protection from the Act about Mustering, and the proclamation began to work with them; And now they did the only Rational Act of their whole Management, and which indeed saved all their Lives.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="281"/>
On <HI>Thursday</HI> Morning, having maturely weighed their Affairs, they resolved to separate, and lay down their Arms, which accordingly they did very quietly and calmly, and carryed their Arms, not to the Magistrates, where they had them, but to the Deacons of their Trades, who they knew were their Friends.</P>
<P>How it came to pass, That Providence, whom they had so far provoked, Inspir'd them with this Prudence, so seasonably for their own Safety, none, but that Infinite Goodness, that punishes less than Crimes deserve, can say; 'Tis most certain, they had no par∣ticular Intelligence of the March of the Queens Troops, for the City it self knew nothing of them more than in general; But it was not full two Hours after they had separated, delivered their Arms, and all was quiet, but the Dragoons enter'd the Town, not a Magi∣strate, nor an Inhabitant knew of them, till they saw them upon the Street, to their no small Satisfaction.</P>
<P>The whole Party was about 220 Men; They had march'd with great Secrecy all Night, and suffered no Body to pass by them, to carry Notice before of their Coming—; When they came near the City, Colonel <HI>Campbell</HI> detach'd an Advanc'd Party of twenty five Dragoons, under the Command of Lieutenant <HI>Pollock</HI> who knew the Town, and knew where <HI>Finlay</HI> liv'd, the whole Body following at a small Distance.</P>
<P>The Lieutenant entering the Town, stopt, and Allighted just at <HI>Finlay</HI>'s Door, and rushing immediately in with two or three Dra∣goons, they find <HI>Finlay</HI> and one <HI>Montgomery,</HI> another of the Knot, but Famous for nothing that ever I heard of, but his being taken with him, sitting by the Fire; They seiz'd them immediately, and by this time the whole Body was entered the City, March'd down to the Cross, and Drew up there on the Street, where they sate still upon their Horses, it Raining very hard all the time, which was about three Hours.</P>
<P>The Mob of the City were in no small Consternation, as may well be supposed, at this Appearance; And several, whose Guilt gave them Ground to think of the Gallows, made the best of their way out of the Town; There was no Appearance of any Rescue, and the Dragoons Commanded the People off of the Street, and to keep their Houses—; Two Fellows had the Boldness to Beat a Drum in two several parts of the City, but the Gentlemen they call'd for, had more Wit than to come, and the Drummers, with very much Difficulty, narrowly escap'd being killed.</P>
<P>The Dragoons having secur'd their Prisoners, and mounted them on Horse-back, with their Legs tyed under the Horses Bellys; Never so much as Allighted or Baited their Horses, but Marched away the same Afternoon to <HI>Kilsyth.</HI></P>
<P>As they were going away, they had some Stones Thrown at them from the Tops of Houses, and some that were stragling be∣hind had like to have been Knock'd off of their Horses, but Six or Seven Dragoons coming back, they were setched off without Hurt.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="282"/>
No sooner were they gone out of the Town, but the Drums beat again in all the Streets, and the Rable got together with all the Rage and Venome imaginable, and coming to the Magistrates, they told them in so many words, that they should send some of their Number to <HI>Edinburgh</HI> immediately, for that if they had not their two Men delivered to them, they would pull their Houses down about their Ears. Some have blam'd the Magistrates for sending to <HI>Edinburgh;</HI> But if such would consider Circumstances, how the Dragoons were gone, they had an Enrag'd Mob to deal with, and no strength to Defend themselves, it can not but be thought the Gentlemen were in the right to comply with the Juncture of the Time, and Gratifie rather than Exasperate them, when they were abso∣lutely in their Power.</P>
<P>The Magistrates, however, according to the Command of their Masters the Mobb, (for such at this time they were,) sent away two of the Baillies of the Town, and some of the Deacons of Trades went with them, but they soon came back again as wise as they went, having received a severe Check from the Council by the Mouth of the Lord Chancellor; and it was once within a little of their being committed to Prison with the other.</P>
<P>Thus ended, this petty War, being the only Violence we meet with in the whole Transaction. I had not been so large in the Re∣lation of so triffling an Affair, but that it serves to clear up several other Cases to the World, which otherwise there are several Mistakes about.</P>
<P N="1">1. And principally indeed for the sake of the City of <HI>Glasgow,</HI> a City which in all Ages since the Reformation, and in the very Re∣formation it self, has been particularly Famous for Honesty, Zeal, and Bravery in a constant Opposition to the Enemies either of the Religion or Liberties of their Countrey—, a City Eminent for the True and Sincere Profession of the Reformed Religion, and forward upon all Occasions to spend their Blood and Treasure in Defence of it: And as nothing can be more Untrue than to suggest, this Tu∣mult was the Act and Deed of the City of <HI>Glasgow:</HI> So to clear her of that Scandal, I thought my self oblig'd to do her Justice, by set∣ting the Case in its true Light; nothing clears up the Innocence of a Person or Party like bare matter of Fact, and therefore I have Im∣partially related this Story just as I receiv'd it upon the Spot from se∣veral of the principal Inhabitants of the City, whose Integrity in the Relation I have no Reason to question.</P>
<P>Nothing is more certain, than that the Tumult at <HI>Glasgow</HI> had its Rise and Beginning among the <HI>Jacobite</HI> Party: In all the Rabble and Riots, they were secured as they past the Streets, they were Carrest by the Mob, they Huzza'd them to the Work, their Houses were never search'd for Arms, nor the least Insult offered to their Persons; The very Leaders of the Rabble were of their Party, and indeed their Friends mixt themselves with the Rabbles on all Occasions, to prompt them to Insult the Citizens.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="283"/>
The Rabblers themselves on the other hand were a sort of Peo∣ple ignorantly Inflam'd by this Party, and unhappily set on Fire by an Accident which had its beginning rather in an Ignorance of the Plot of that Party, than Design to serve them in it.</P>
<P>But for the City of <HI>Glasgow</HI> it is clear, not a Citizen of any Note, not a Magistrate, not a Merchant, not any thing that can be cal∣led Denominating to a Place, but what Abhorr'd it, and as far as they durst Opposed it; and I think 'tis hard they should first fall under the Misfortune, and then under the Scandal of it too; And for that Reason I have been thus particular in the Story.</P>
<P>Again, here may be seen a small Scetch of the Petitioners and Addressers against the Union, &amp; of their Original, who they are that were moved, and who moved them; not a Papist, not a Jacobite, not a Prelatist in <HI>Scotland</HI> but what Declar'd themselves against the Union; and those honest Men that unhappily Approve them in that, may see what Blessed Company they were yoked with, which is a Hint I cannot avoid leaving upon Record for their Instruction.</P>
<P>I should have told you that the <HI>Sunday</HI> after being the 15<HI>th</HI> of <HI>De∣cember,</HI> the Dragoons returned to <HI>Glasgow,</HI> and in stead of return∣ing the two Prisoners they had taken, carried away three more, and had Directions for others, but it seems they were fled.</P>
<P>They went to <HI>Hamilton</HI> also, and seiz'd two Gentlemen &amp; a Lady, who belong'd to the Dutchess—, and who, they said, <HI>Finlay</HI> Accused, but both these, and all the rest, were, after the Union was finished, Discharged without Punishment; the Merciful Go∣vernment of Her Majesty rather delighting to Pity, than to Punish the Follies of the poor deluded people; shewing them the Difference between the legally Establish'd Power, which they blindly Opposed, and the past Implacable and Merciless Tyrrany, which they as blindly Espoused.</P>
<P>And thus happily Ended the Tumult at <HI>Glasgow,</HI> which put the Honest People of both Nations in no small Apprehensions; and which, if the Party had obtain'd their Design, in getting the poor People into Arms in other Places, might have been Fatal enough.</P>
<P>Mean time, the Queen was not Unconcerned at these Disorders, and Troops were sent from <HI>England</HI> to the Borders, to be ready to Assist the <HI>Scots</HI> Forces, and to support the Government, if there had been Occasion; having Orders given them to Quarter in the most Northerly Towns of <HI>England,</HI> and to take their farther Orders from the Lord High Commissioner of <HI>Scotland,</HI> as there should be Oc∣casion. But the Success of Things beginning to change a little after these Hurreys, there was no Occasion for them.</P>
<P>The Parliament was now entered upon the closs Debate of the Articles, and the first and chief Points being past in the House, it was plain to every body, that the House was resolved to go thorow the Work; And it is no wonder if the last Struggles of all the Parties Opposing it, were now seen.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="284" MS="y"/>
All the Attempts to raise Tumults, and to Rabble the Parliament out of it, had proved Abortive; And it was found impossible to bring the Common People into any thing Extraordinary, while few or none of the Gentry thought fit to appear with them; All that had hitherto been done, was, by an underhand kind of Management of the <HI>Jacobite</HI> Party, <HI>as they called them,</HI> to see, if possible, they could push the Presbyterians, or the meer Rabble of the Common People upon making some Disturbance, that so they might pull down their Enemies, by the Hands of one another, and see their Work done for them; This was apparent from the manner of Proceedings, which was by dropping Papers, and sending about private Mes∣sages from no particular Person, but as from their Brethren in this or that Shire, Inviting, Directing, and Encouraging the People to Meet and Assemble, to furnish themselves with Arms and Amu∣nition, and Nameing Place and Day where to Meet and Assemble, in order to March to <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and to Raise the Parliament, and prevent the Ruine, <HI>such they then called the Ʋnion,</HI> of their Coun∣trey, and their being given up to the <HI>English.</HI></P>
<P>They took all these Courses to Raise and Excite the People, but still they found it Ineffectual as to Meetings and Rendezvouzes, ex∣cept as you have seen; however, the Parliament took some notice of it, the Lord Commissioner laid it before them on the 29 <HI>No∣vember,</HI> and they immediately caused a Proclamation to be publish∣ed, to prevent Tumultary and Irregular Convocations of the Liedges; This was the same which was Read in <HI>Glasgow</HI> at the Time of the Tumult, as aforesaid, when the People Stoned the Messenger that Read it, off from the Head of the Stairs of the Town Hall or Tol∣booth.</P>
<P>It had been considered, that there was a Clause in the Act of Se∣curity, which Impowered the People to Meet, or Conveen in Arms, under pretence of Exercising the Fencible Men—; The Clause was as follows.<Q>And for a further Security to this Realm, Her Majesty with Advice and Consent aforesaid, Statutes and Enacts, That the whole Protestant Heretors, and all the Burghs within the same, shall forthwith provide themselves with Fire Arms for all the fencible Men who are Protestants within their respective Bounds, and those of the Bore proportioned to a Bullet of 14 Drop weight running; And the said Heretors and Burghs are hereby Im∣powered and Ordained to Discipline and Exercise their fencible Men, once in the Month at least.</Q></P>
<P>Now the first Rumours of Country Tumults had been pretended to be founded upon this Clause, and that under pretence of this Exercising and Disciplining the Fencible Men, any number of Men might appear together in Arms without Breach of the Law—. This was indeed a wide Gap in the publick Peace, at which there was Room for a whole Army to enter. For any of the Gentry, No∣bility,
<PB N="74" REF="285"/>
or Heretors, who were Disaffected to the Affair now in hand under the protection of this Clause, pretending only Exercising and Disciplining the Fencible Men, might Assemble together, and keep together without any Limitation of Number or Time, till they had formed a sufficient Force, and then March'd, to the Destruction of the Government, the Laws, and all the Defences of the publick Peace.</P>
<P>It was time now to stop this Breach, and therefore an Act was past in the House, to Repeal the above-said Clause, so far forth as it extended to the Meeting, Mustering, and Conveening together of the People during the sitting of the Parliament; which Act being a very plain Evidence to the Truth of what I am upon, I have Added here, as being not long enough to interrupt the Thread of this Discourse.<Q>OUR SOVEREIGN LADY Considering, That, by the 3<HI>d</HI> Act of the 2<HI>d</HI> Session of this Parliament, Intituled, <HI>Act for Se∣curity of the Kingdom,</HI> It is Statute and Enacted, That the whole Protestant Heretors, and all the Burghs within the same, shall furthwith provide themselves with Fire Arms for all the Fencible Men, who are Protestants, within their respective Bounds, and the said Heretors and Burghs are thereby Impowered and Or∣dained to Discipline and Exercise their Fencible Men once in the Month at least; And also Considering, That the Disorderly and Seditious Meetings and Tumults in some Places in the Coun∣trey, do make it necessary, at this Occasion, to Suspend the Effect of the foresaid Clause, during this Session of Parliament allen∣narly. <HI>Therefore</HI> Her Majesty, with Advice and Consent of the Estates of Parliament, doth hereby Suspend the Effect of the foresaid Clause, and that during this Session of Parliament al∣lennarly. <HI>And further,</HI> Her Majesty, with Advice and Consent foresaid, Discharges and strictly Prohibites the Subjects of this Kingdom, to Meet and Assemble together in Arms, after the Publication hereof, upon any Pretence whatsoever, during the Space foresaid, without Her Majesties special Command, or express Licence had or obtained thereto. And Requires and Commands all the Subjects of this Kingdom, to Retire to their own Habi∣tations and Lawful Employments; Certifying such as shall do in the contrary That they shall be lyable to the Pains of High Treason, conform to the Laws and Acts of Parliament made against Ʋnlawful Convocations and Rising in Arms.</Q></P>
<P>This was a most Effectual Step to Check the Riots and Tumults of the People, for after this, no Man of any Consideration durst show himself; And finding the Government Resolved to punish whoever should make any Attempt of that Nature, they began to give over the Thought of taking Arms.</P>
<P>Thus the Affair without Doors seem'd to attend the Debates of the Parliament, and all we meet from Abroad, amounted to no
<PB N="75" REF="286"/>
more than Addresses without Number from the Towns and Coun∣treys and some from the Presbyteries, against the Union in the Terms of the Articles, with Disputes about Amendments to the se∣veral Articles, as they came before them: The particular Cases of which will come of Course, in the Observations on the Minutes of Parliament.—</P>
<P>Mean time it may be noted, the Parliament enter'd upon the De∣bate of the Articles, Stating the Duties, Settling the Equivalent that was to be paid to <HI>Scotland,</HI> in Consideration of the <HI>English</HI> Debts, Proportioning the Excise, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>This Affair of the <HI>English</HI> Debts has been such an Occasion of Clamour in <HI>Scotland,</HI> that I cannot but think it very necessary to give a State of it in short, as it lay before the Parliament.</P>
<P>The Treaters in <HI>England,</HI> as has been noted in the Observations on the Minutes of the Treaty in <HI>London,</HI> had been convinced of the Necessity of having the Customs and Excises of <HI>Scotland,</HI> when they came to an Union, run in the same Channel with the Excises and Customs in <HI>England;</HI> and this, by Consequence, engaged them in the same Appropriations and Incumberances, that the same Du∣ties in <HI>England</HI> were lyable to.</P>
<P>This created an Objection, <HI>viz.</HI> That <HI>Scotland</HI> was under no Incumberance of Debt, at least none that those Duties were appro∣priated to; and therefore, to bring her into Taxes <HI>of any sort,</HI> other than such as were to bear the Burthen of the War, was not consistent with the Equalities of Burthens, which were allowed to be the only Foundation of an Union.</P>
<P>The Equity of this was not to be withstood, and therefore the <HI>English</HI> Commissioners readily agreed, there was no Reason the Re∣venue of <HI>Scotland</HI> should be applyed to the <HI>English</HI> Debt without Conditions—; But as the Circumstances of the Nations requir∣ed an Equality of Taxes, and those Taxes in <HI>Scotland</HI> must run in the Channel of the Taxes of the same Kinds in <HI>England,</HI> the <HI>English</HI> must pay to <HI>Scotland</HI> an Equivalent in Money: This was settled by the Treaty, as in the Minutes appears at large.</P>
<P>Now the Equivalent being determin'd, the Parliament was for a long while imployed in debating what Taxes, what Customs, and what Excises should be paid by <HI>Scotland</HI>—; It is needless to enter up∣on the particular Reasonings on the several Heads as they were de∣bated in the Parliament, since the Minutes of the Parliament will particularly discuss those Points, but it may be needful to note a little the Reasons of all those Disputes.</P>
<P>I have often noted, That there was a Party who were busy, not so much in Arguing for Regulating, as Destroying the Articles; that Argued against the Union in general, not against the Articles in particular; These having in vain struggled against the main Ar∣ticles of the Treaty, such as Union in general, Succession, Com∣munication of Trade, and the like, began now to Labour at the par∣ticular Heads; and first they would have it, that <HI>Scotland</HI> should not pay any of the Customs or Excises in Use in <HI>England,</HI> but when
<PB N="76" REF="287"/>
convinc'd of the Injustice of those Pretences, they could no longer object against an Equality of Taxes; Then they began new De∣bates upon the Circumstances of the said Customs and Excises, and push'd at all sorts of Exemptions, Inequalities of Payments, Re∣strictions and Latitudes they could imagine, if possible to bring on some Amendments upon the Articles, which they knew would per∣plex the Union in the <HI>English</HI> Parliament, such were the Liberty of Exporting Wooll, the Exemption from the Duties on Salt for ever, the Reducing their Ale to the Excise of Small Beer in <HI>England,</HI> and the like; And this makes it appear, that I have not wronged them, in saying, that their Design was at the Union in gene∣ral.</P>
<P>It would be too much to enter upon the Discourse here of the several Objections against the Equivalent, the Taxes, the Excises, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and innumerable Cavils at the several Duties on Export or Im∣port—. These things occupied the whole Town, and all the People, as their several Fancies and Informers led them, spent the time in Canvassing and Disputing the Articles of Commerce, Im∣post, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> what could be paid, and what not.</P>
<P>Nor is it to be wondred, that these Debates were Warm, for as the prospect of Tumult began to abate, the People took the more liberty in Speech, and the Government being very backward to Punish the Exorbitances of the Tongue, at a Time when they were Inviting all the People to Unite, all the Gall and ill Humour of the Party vented it self at the Mouth. This filled the Countrey with innumerable Railry and Reproach, all Companies were divided; nay, even Families, Relations, and the nearest in Affection, divided upon this Subject.</P>
<P>The Scruples of Religion also revived now, and a great many finding the Treaty was like to go on, began to set up their Foun∣dations for Opposition, and revive the Scruples of the Union in∣terfeiring with the National Covenant, the Danger of the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> from the Suffrages of the <HI>English</HI> Bishops, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>All these things helped to raise Heats among the People, and some went up to a strange height of Jealousie and Discontent, and what <HI>they could do,</HI> they did; As for Tumults and Rebellions, that time began to be over with them, but Parties and Feuds encreased every Day: And so they went on till the Parliament went thro' the whole Treaty, and how they behaved then, will follow to be spo∣ken to in its Course.</P>

<P>Moved, That the Lord <HI>Banff,</HI> who was sometime Papist, being now Protestant, and willing to sign the <HI>Formula</HI> subjoyned to the Act of Parliament in <HI>November</HI> 1700, <HI>For preventing the Growth of Popery,</HI> may be admitted, and accordingly he having taken and signed the <HI>Formula,</HI> he thereafter Swore the Oath of Allegiance, sub∣scribed the same with the Assurance, and took the Oath of Parlia∣ment.</P>
<P>Petition Lady <HI>Mary Bruce</HI> and <HI>William Cochran</HI> younger of <HI>Ochiltrie</HI> her Husband for his Interest, against admitting of Sir <HI>Alexander Bruce</HI> to sit in Parliament in the Rank and Dignity of Earl of <HI>Kincardin,</HI> Read, Sir <HI>Alexander Bruce</HI> in Answer to the said Petition, craved that the Patent in Favours of Earl <HI>Edward Bruce</HI> of <HI>Kincardin,</HI> might be also Read, which being accordingly Read; after some Debate upon the Case, It was put to the Vote, <HI>Hear the Parties further upon the Matter,</HI> Or <HI>Admit</HI> Sir <HI>Alexander,</HI> and it carried <HI>Hear,</HI> and the next <HI>Sederunt</HI> appointed for a Hearing.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATION 1<HI>st.</HI></HEAD>
<P>It might be noticed here, That several Gentlemen take the Oath of Parliament, who had nor done the same before; I observe it, because it was said, that some did so particularly to Qualifie themselves to be Serviceable in this Cause, to the respective Interests they Espoused, I do not say it was so, nor do I care to distinguish Persons so much, as to put any Mark upon Names from Common Fame, every one is to Judge of that as they think fit.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="290"/>
The Party against the Union finding the Articles, as they were concluded at <HI>London,</HI> were concealed, or at least not made publick, gave out in <HI>Scotland,</HI> That the <HI>Scots</HI> Commissio∣ners having had it in their Power to obtain most Advantage∣ous Conditions from <HI>England,</HI> but having been brought basely to submit to the Arbitrary Designs of some Leading Men im∣ployed in the Treaty in <HI>England,</HI> they had been very super∣ficial in their Demands, and therefore durst not publish their Proceedings, till the Parliament of <HI>Scotland</HI> met, and then the whole Treaty would be rejected, which would be agreeable to others of the Commissioners of both Nations: This groundless Opinion being diffused, and believed by many of their Party of best Sense, made them easie and unactive, till too late they perceived the Queen, Her Ministers, and all Persons concerned in Adjusting that Treaty, to be in earnest, and then they turn'd the same Notion to another Use, <HI>viz.</HI> To Calumniate and Reproach the Commissioners.</P>
<P>The Printing the Articles also, which the Opposers of the Union afterwards boasted of as their Act and Deed, was introduced against their Design; For, at the private Meetings of those against the Union, the Question was, how to delay the Printing of the Articles, or any thing else, whereby to gain Time, till the Parliament of <HI>England</HI> should meet, which was then Prorogued to the twenty third of <HI>October;</HI> So that both Parliaments sitting together, they expected to confound the Measures for carry∣ing on the Treaty by mutual Proposals, Doubts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But this Project of delaying the Printing of the Articles was prevented, for the Articles being presented and read, after a long Silence in the House, Mr. <HI>Seton</HI> of <HI>Pitmedden</HI> rose up, and told the Lord Chancellor, That he found himself obliged to pro∣pose the Printing the Articles, which had been read in the House, to the end the Curiosity and Judgment of all sorts of People might be satisfied, and that the not Printing might be no Argument, in time coming, for a Delay to the Ratifying of the Treaty. Which Proposal was resumed by the Lord Chancellor, and no Member opposing or seconding it, he looked upon it as Acquiesced to, and Ordered the Articles to be Printed.</P>
<P>Nota, <HI>The Minutes of the Treaty at</HI> London, <HI>and the Articles agreed on there, should have been insert∣ed here, but they are already brought in at large, and need not be repeated. The Speech of the Lord Com∣missioner also, and the Lord Chancellor, together with the Queens Letter, are Inserted in the Part immediately preceed∣ing this, to which I refer; And therefore, and to avoid Repetition, they are left out here, tho' they properly belong to this Days Minute.</HI></P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATION III.</HEAD>
<P>Great Opposition was made in Parliament this Day a∣gainst Reading the Articles—, and several Arguments brought by the Gentlemen on that side for Delays—, a∣mong which this was one, and this the first time it was start∣ed in the House, <HI>viz.</HI> The Consulting Principals or Consti∣tuents, and some Gentlemen went so far, as to acknowlege the Power of a Member of Parliament was Limited by their Constituents; and that the Parliament could not lawfully De∣bate, much less Determine an Affair of such a Nature as this, <HI>viz.</HI> Of Destroying the Constitution without, as afore∣said, Consulting and Obtaining the Consent of their Con∣stituents.</P>
<P>It was Replyed that,
<LIST>
<ITEM> 1. This was not a destroying the Constitution.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The Parliament was particularly Called by Her Majesty for this End; and the Work expressed in the Proclamation for their Election, and that therefore they were particularly Elected by their Constituents for this Work, and thereby Im∣powered to Debate and Conclude it, without farther Powers.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Others Argued the Positive, and Affirmed the Parlia∣ment had full Power to Act on this Matter, tho' there had been no such Expression in the Proclamation.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The Debate was long, and warm enough, and began to Inform us what was to be expected; but on the whole it was carried to Read the Articles, by a great Majority: The other being taken as an Attempt to gain Time.</P>
<P>A Proposal was made this Day for a General Fast—, which occasioned some Debates, but was Adjourned.</P>
<P>And here it was very publickly observed, from what Hands the Motion of a Fast came: Some maliciously enough, tho' merrily, Noted, That the Motion of a Fast came first from those, who were very rarely observ'd either to Fast or Pray, and that now began to Talk so Religiously, that it was taken for a meer Banter.</P>
<P>On the other Hand it was observed, That the most Sober and Religious Members, both of the Nobility and Gentry, opposed this Motion in the House; But the Reason was evident.</P>
<P>The great Project just then carrying on in the Kingdom, was to Amuse the People, Possess them with Fears of some Strange Thing then Transacting, and of Impending Dangers dreadful to the Kingdom, and which they had no Remedy
<PB N="6" REF="293"/>
to prevent, but as in great Distress, to fly to their Prayers as Mariners in a Storm—: This they thought would, of Course, be made the more Terrible by the Ministers in gene∣ral, exciting the People to extraordinary Humiliations, which, <HI>whether ill design'd or no,</HI> might be ill enough Impro∣ved, and the People thereby made the more Uneasy.</P>
<P>Perhaps also they might hope for some Indiscretion and undue Warmth in the Pulpit, especially from some Men, which they were willing to think they could influence to so much Weakness, but in this also they were disappointed.</P>
<P>For the same Reasons, those Gentlemen who were of the most Religious Conversation, and known to be well Affected to the Church, and to any thing that had but an Aspect of sincere Piety, were nevertheless against this Fast, as Unsea∣sonable and Dangerous, and as a thing they foresaw was de∣sign'd particularly to make the People Uneasy with these Pros∣pects; The Debate was urged warmly enough on both sides, but at last was Adjourn'd; and so the designed Fast was put off for the present, tho' it was afterwards introduced piece meal, and all the use made of it that could be to raise the Spirits of the People, if possible, to the Disorders aimed at, as we shall see in the Sequel of this History.</P>

<P>Moved, That according to the last Minutes, the Parliament should now proceed to the Consideration of the Articles of the Uni∣on.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATION IV.</HEAD>
<P>Here, the Gentlemen who appeared against the Union, finding they could not carry the Point, as Debated the last Day, Moved for a Delay of but Eight Days; and several Ar∣guments were offered, to obtain so short a Delay.</P>
<P>But in this, they lost several of those who Voted with them before, and who seeing the Vote of Consulting Consti∣tuents Rejected, could not be convinced of the Advantage of eight days Delay; and this made it seem more particularly a Design only to Delay.</P>
<P>Whereupon the Question being put, it was carried by a great Majority; And this was the first Tryal of the Strength of the Parties, and the first encouraging Proof that the Union would go on: The Majority on this Vote was sixty four, but the Names having not yet been Ordered to be made pub∣lick, it was not known who were on one side or the other.</P>
<P>Before this Vote was put, it was also Debated, whether this Reading of the Articles, should be in order to proceed upon them to a Vote. And here again the Gentlemen had their Turn of Advantage, nor was there any great Oppositi∣on; for those who were for the Union; were yet willing to have it fully Debated, and all things for its better Explana∣tion understood; and were content to have it as thorowly Ex∣amined as they pleased, and therefore gave their Votes freely for a general Reading.</P>
<P>The other Gentlemen who were only pushing at Delays, and striving to gain Time, thought they gain'd a great Point in this, and therefore with all their Interest they push'd at a general Reading only, which was presently agreed to, <HI>viz. That the Articles should be Read and</HI> Discoursed <HI>of in this Parliament; but that none of them should be Voted, till all was Read over and Considered.</HI></P>
<P>Upon the above Debate, and concluding only to Read and Discourse, the first Article of the Treaty was Read publickly, but the Reading of the Commissions and Minutes, taking up a great deal of Time, there was not much Discourse in the House at that time, for the great Affair now in Agitation, was to stir up the People without Doors, and bring them ei∣ther by Clamour, Tumult, or Tumultuous Addresses, to de∣clare a general Dislike both of the Union in General, and of the Articles in Particular; And at this time they began to Threaten from without Doors.</P>
<P>The Streets and Doors were exceedingly Throug'd this Day in expectation of the Event, the People expecting igno∣rantly to hear whether the first Article was Voted and Ap∣proved, or Rejected; and when some Body came out and
<PB N="8" REF="295"/>
said Unwarrily the first Article was not Voted, it run thro' the Town, that it was Rejected; And the Mob, who ap∣peared now to be Managed by some Gentlemen, began to Shout, and People apprehended the Union had been Voted against in the General, but they were Discovered too soon by this, and it was presently understood, that the Article was only Discoursed of and the Discourse Adjourned too.</P>
<P>The next day the Minutes being Printed, the Minds of the People were a little Cool'd, when they saw the House went on so deliberately, and that nothing was to be Voted, while all the Articles were Read over and Considered.</P>

<P>Address of the Commission of the late General Assembly of the Church of this Kingdom, for Establishing and Confirming the true Protestant Religion, and Government of the Church, as by Law, Established therein, Read; And thereupon the Parliament De∣clared, That, before Concluding the Union, They would take the said Address to their Consideration, and would do every thing Ne∣cessary for Securing the true Protestant Religion and Church-Go∣vernment, presently by Law Established in this Kingdom.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATION V.</HEAD>
<P>The Commission of the General Assembly having sate from the 9<HI>th</HI> Instant, had been in several warm Debates about the Matter, in what manner they should behave themselves in this Juncture: Some Hot Gentlemen had given them Di∣sturbance
<PB N="9" REF="296"/>
enough about the Matter of the Fast, and with∣out Doors it was Reported, they would Protest against the Union.</P>
<P>But the Generality being Governed by more Temper and Moderation than some People hoped for, all things went on there peaceably, <HI>I mean,</HI> as to their publick Resolutions; And the Address to the Parliament was conceived in as Mo∣derate Terms as could be expected, and is at large Printed in the <HI>Appendix, N. B*.</HI></P>
<P>The Answer to it was also satisfactory enough—, in that they declared, they would go upon the Address, before any thing was concluded; It was however warmly pressed in the Parliament, That the said Address should be immediately entered upon, before they went on upon the Union—; But this, as another Advantage design'd for Delay, was check'd, and the Answer in the Minute agreed upon.</P>
<P>Great Pains was taken also at this time, to make the Commission of the Assembly uneasy at this Answer, as not satisfactory; Jealousies were fomented, and Suggestions whis∣pered about from one to another, as if the Parliament de∣sign'd to postpone the Affairs of the Church to the last, and so perhaps drop them at once: This obtained but too much, and being put forward by warm and uneasy People, grew higher and higher, and help'd on the Inflammations which unhappily follow'd.</P>
<P>The subject of the First Article, tho' not Named in the Minutes was also re-assumed in the Discourses of this Day, and several Arguments against the Union it self, as an Incorporating Uni∣on, were brought, in order to prove it Impracticable, Incon∣venient, and Disadvantageous to <HI>Scotland;</HI> And therefore, that they ought rather to proceed upon the Consideration of the general, before they went on to the particular Articles.</P>
<P>This however was only Discoursed, and the Reading the several Articles having been already Approven, they pro∣ceeded to the Reading the rest of the Articles, as in the Minutes.</P>
<P>In the Reading the Second Article, the <HI>English</HI> Act of Parliament for Limiting the Succession, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> was Discoursed on, and much was said about the <HI>English</HI> Limitations; and some People that had been of another Mind formerly, seem∣ed to discover an Inclination of coming into the Succession with Limitations, and began to enter into the Matter of Li∣mitations; But this being remote to the Work was dropt for the present, and we shall meet with it again in its place.</P>
<P>The Third Article also relating to Uniting the Parlia∣ments of both Kingdoms was Read, and some took the Li∣berty to Jest with it as a Chytherical Calculation, and that they had no Power to Alter the Representative of the Nati∣on, that <HI>Scotland</HI> could not Consent to be Govern'd by any
<PB N="10" REF="297"/>
other Representative, than they were now; And that, if the Parliaments were to be made one, <HI>Scotlands</HI> whole Par∣liament ought to be joyned to the <HI>English</HI> Parliament, and that <HI>Scotland</HI> ought no more to Abridge her Representative than <HI>England,</HI> and the like.</P>
<P>But the Unreasonableness of this was urged from the Dis∣parity, in Extent of the Country, Number of People, and Proportion of Taxes, of which hereafter.</P>
<P>The Five Ensuing Articles being all upon Privileges of Trade, Excises and Customs, the Discourses were very gene∣ral on both sides, and those things seem'd referr'd to more Debates afterwards: All that was said of those things now, seem'd rather to tend, if possible, to perswade the People in general, that the Union was Impracticable, that <HI>Scotland</HI> could not come into the Taxes, and that the Equalities talk'd of, would ruine their Trade and starve their Poor.</P>
<P>Without Doors, strange Use was made of these Articles of Taxes, and the People were made to believe, their Salt, their Malt, their Beer, their Fish, would all be Loaded with Insupportable Taxes, and their whole Trade should be ruin'd, their Houses plunder'd for Taxes, and their People starv'd; And no Man that shall see, with what Frightful Apprehensi∣ons the poor People were possest, will any more wonder, they were so easily brought into Tumults and Disorders—.</P>
<P>Nota, <HI>This Day there were strong Rumours about the Town, of the Mob coming up to the Parliament, to demand, That the Crown and Scepter of</HI> Scotland <HI>should not be given up, and carryed away to</HI> England.</P>
<P>This was the Effect of some Popular Speeches let fall by those Gentlemen who opposed the Treaty, and industriously spread about the Town a Report, That the Sovereignty of <HI>Scotland</HI> was to be Subjected to the <HI>English;</HI> And the poor∣er Sort that understood less, had the same Thing in other Words, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Crown of <HI>Scotland</HI> was Betray'd; That it was to be carryed to <HI>England,</HI> and never to be seen here more. Of which see at large in its place.</P>
<P>The House, however, took no Notice of this yet, as being a Rumour only, tho' the Members were not without Apprehen∣sions, That it might rise to a greater Height; And that they might come to be Insulted, even in the House, as indeed was afterwards very probable.</P>

<P>The Parliament proceeded to the further Consideration of the Ar∣ticles of Union, and the Ninth, Tenth, Eleventh, Twelfth, Thir∣teenth and Fourteenth Articles were all severally Read, with the Minutes of Treaty relating thereto, and were all Discoursed on.</P>
<P>The Fifteenth Article of Union was likeways twice Read, and Discoursed and Reasoned on; as also, the Minutes relative there∣to: And after some Reasoning thereon, there arose a Debate about the Calculation of the Equivalent of Three Hundred Ninety Eight Thousand Eighty Five Pounds Ten Shillings therein-mentioned, which was adjourned till the next <HI>Sederunt</HI> of Parliament.</P>
<P><HI>Adjourned till</HI> Tuesday <HI>next at Ten a Clock.</HI></P>

<DIV2 N="6" TYPE="observation">
<HEAD>OBSERVATION VI.</HEAD>
<P>The Calculations of the Ninth Article were a little Exa∣mined, but appeared so just, and the Equalities so well Stat∣ed, That there was no Room to object; For the Cess being but the same upon <HI>Scotland</HI> as before, there could nothing be said, why they should not go into Measures for carrying on any joynt Expence, which, in Time to come, the United Body should see Cause to put the Whole to.</P>
<P>And this was the first Visible Explication of the Doctrine of Equalities, and a Proof that Equalities consisted in Pro∣portions, <HI>of which more hereafter:</HI> Some People, to serve the Designs now on Foot, had made the Ignorant People be∣lieve, That, by Equalities, would be understood a Numerical Equality, and that <HI>Scotland</HI> should pay in every Thing just as the <HI>English</HI> did—; This did therefore a little serve to open the Eyes of Considering People and let them see, that the Treaty had been founded upon something of Justice; For, by this time, it had been Represented as a Strange many-Headed Monster, that had nothing but Mouths and Teeth, and Unfathomable Gulphs to Devour and Destroy the People.</P>
<P>The Five Articles between the Ninth and Fifteenth re∣quir'd little Debate, since they consisted only of Negatives, and Provision made for <HI>Scotland</HI> against payment of any of the Duties then Levyed in <HI>England</HI> by the Stamp-Office Tax, Glass-Window Tax, and the several Duties on Coals and Malt, together with Exemption from any of the Proportions of Cess as above for the first Year—; Only, from these Ar∣ticles,
<PB N="12" REF="299"/>
some Gentlemen took Occasion to remind them of the Necessary Care taken by the Treaters, to Exempt <HI>Scotland</HI> in all Cases from such Burdens, as they found them unable to bear, and which absolute Necessity did not oblige them to subject her to, and in such Cases to receive Equivalents, for what ever they were oblig'd to come into by the Necessity of Trade.</P>
<P>But the Ferment was now grown high, and these Dis∣courses had little Signification, the People being Unhappily Prepossess'st beyond the power of Convictions.</P>
<P>The 14<HI>th</HI> Article occasioned long Discourses, both within Doors and without, and a great many ill natur'd Things were said on both sides, the Matter of an Equivalent had not yet been Examined much into, and the Reason, Nature, and Necessity of it, had gone but a very little way into the Un∣derstandings, even of the Gentlemen themselves. The Trea∣ters also here met with some Indecencies, and the Reflections made on them, had such an Effect in publick, as had they not met with some Check, might have been personally Mischie∣vous to them, as to the partacted Abroad; see Fol. 28 <HI>of the next precedent part.</HI> Within Doors they met with some very unkind Reproaches, as if they had not made due Provisions for their Countries Necessities, had consented to Intolerable and Un∣just Burthens, and had Mock'd them with the Notion of an Equivalent, which did not lessen the Burthens upon the Na∣tion their payment being to be Levied where it could not be paid; and then repaid again where it was not Levied.</P>
<P>To make good these Charges, they pretended to make Calculations upon the Proportions of the said Equivalent and some indeed brought in their own rough Draughts of Dis∣proportions, whereupon it was Moved, That the House should enter upon more exact Calculations, and Examine the matters of Fact. Of which see the next Minute.</P>

<P>The Debate anent the Calculation of the Equivalent of Three Hundred Ninety Eight Thousand Eighty Five Pounds Ten Shillings mentioned in the Fifteenth Article of Union, resumed; and after some time spent thereupon, It was agreed to Nominate a Committee of Three Persons of each State to Proceed and Examine the Calcu∣lation of the said Three Hundred Ninety Eight Thousand Eighty Five Pounds Ten Shillings, and to Report to the Parliament, and the next <HI>Sederunt</HI> of Parliament appointed for Nominating the said <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ommittee.</P>

<P>The Sixteenth and Seventeenth Articles were also Read, and the Minutes relative thereto, and were Reasoned upon.</P>
<P>The Eighteenth Article and the Minutes relative thereto were likeways Read, and after some Discourse and Reasoning thereon, The further Consideration of the said Article was delayed till next <HI>Sederunt</HI> of Parliament.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATION VII.</HEAD>
<P>The Debate of the Equivalent grew higher this day than before, and the Fifteenth Article was the Subject of a great Deal of ill natur'd Discourse in the House; From without there was a very Terrible Clamour, and the Humours of the People being brought as it were to a pitch, but too much appeared to Correspond with some thing visible within Doors. Several very unkind Reflections were made upon the Treaters, not upon their Judgments only, but upon their Integrity, as if they had been less just to their Countrey, than consisted with the Trust Reposed in them.</P>
<P>The Gentlemen on the other hand defended them∣selves as calmly as they could, and endeavour'd to clear up the Objections made to the Justice of their Proceedings, offered to Examine the Calculations, and Answer any thing that could be objected: But the House grew too much out of Temper to talk much of it then, and the Prudence of the High Commissioner; in order to Calm Things; and keep them as Easy as possible, prevented its running Higher at that time—. The former Proposal was Reassumed, <HI>viz.</HI> To refer it to the Examination of a Committee; And the House was Moved to Name the Committee.</P>
<P>Upon this Motion; it was again Moved; That none of the Treaters should be capable of being Named to the said Committee—. This, tho' it look'd, as if the Committee were to be a Jury upon the Treaters, to Examine their Con∣duct, yet the Gentlemen unanimously agreed to; And the Choosing a Committee was Approven, who went thorow the Calculations, and gave in such exact Accounts of Things, as abundantly cleared up the Reputation of the Commissioners.</P>
<P>It was also Moved, that to Assist the said Committee, Two very able Accomptants; or Arithmeticians should be found, to Examine the Calculations; one of which was Dr. <HI>James Gregory;</HI> Professor of the Mathematicks in the College of <HI>Edin∣burgh;</HI> The other was Dr. <HI>Thomas Bowar,</HI> Professor of the Ma∣thematicks in the College of <HI>Aberdeen.</HI></P>
<P>The Sixteenth and Seventeenth Articles about the Coin, and about Weights and Measures, occasioned little or no De∣bate.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="301"/>
The Eighteenth Article had indeed some Discourse upon it, as what should, or should not be Alterable by the Parlia∣ment of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and some Gentlemen were for Establish∣ing all the present Laws, without Alteration; A thing no Nation in the World practises, since Circumstances of Nations Altering, may always make it Necessary to Alter, Amend, Re∣new, or Repeal the Laws and Usages of a Nation:</P>
<P>And the Distinction in the Article it self, was such, as few could object, viz. <HI>That no Alteration should be made in the Laws, respecting private Rights, except for the evident Ʋtility of the Subject within</HI> Scotland. This therefore, seemed to Ex∣plain the true Meaning of the Article in that Point; yet the other part of the Article about the Laws of Publick Right, Policy, and Civil Government, being made the same thro' out the whole United Kingdom; this occasioned long Dis∣courses, and held the House so late, that they thought fit to Adjourn it till the next <HI>Sederunt.</HI></P>

<P>The Parliament, conform to the Minute of the last <HI>Sederunt,</HI> Pro∣ceeded to Elect the Committee for Examination of the Calculation of the Equivalent of Three Hundred Ninety Eight Thousand Eighty Five Pounds Ten Shillings. And the Three Estates Sepa∣rated to their usual Places, Returned and Reported their respective Elections, and the List of the Committee is as follows; Of the No∣bility, The Marquess of <HI>Montrose</HI> Lord President of the Privy Coun∣cil, the Duke of <HI>Argyle</HI> and the Marquess of <HI>Tweeddale;</HI> Of the Commis∣sioners for Shires, Sir <HI>Alexander Campbell</HI> of <HI>Cesnock, George Baillie</HI> of <HI>Jerviswood</HI> and <HI>John Hadden</HI> of <HI>Glenagies;</HI> Of the Commissioners for Burghs, <HI>Robert Inglis,</HI> Lieutenant Colonel <HI>John Areskine</HI> and <HI>Hugh Montgomery,</HI> and the Committee was appointed to meet in the Inner-Session House the first Interval day of Parliament, at Ten of the Clock in the Forenoon.</P>
<P>Thereafter the Eighteenth Article of Union was again Read, and upon Reasoning thereon, It was Moved, That the <HI>Enlish</HI> Laws concerning Regulation of Trade, Customs and such Excises, to which this Kingdom by virtue of the Treaty, is to be lyable, be Printed for Information. Moved likeways that it be Remitted to a Committee to Consider the several Branches of Our Trade as to Ex∣port and Import, with the <HI>English</HI> Laws and Book of Rates in Re∣lation thereto, with the Customs and Excises thereof, for the Satis∣faction of the Members of Parliament thereanent, and to cause Print such of the Acts of the <HI>English</HI> Parliament concerning the same as

<HEAD>OBSERVATION VIII.</HEAD>
<P>This was the Fatal Day of the Tumult in the Streets, and the House was no less warm within, proportionably speak∣ing, than the Gentlemen were without, all which had its Share in Agitating the publick Confusions: I am far from saying, That the Arguments used within Doors, occasioned the Rabbles, but the Improvement a Party without Doors made of them, and the manner in which things now said in the Parliament were Represented without, concurr'd to encrease the Ferment of the Nation.</P>
<P>The Discourses on the Eighteenth Article were now car∣ryed on with great Warmth; Many long Speeches were made this Day, too long to be set down here, but tending all to this, That <HI>Scotland</HI> ought not to subject themselves to Duties of any sort, before it should be known what such Duties were; That no Laws of Customs or Excises should take place, and that it could not be proper to allow the several Laws of Excise or Customs in <HI>England,</HI> till it was first calculated and agreed, what Customs and Excises <HI>Scot∣land</HI> was to pay—; Then the Discourses on the paying Equalities of Taxes being re-assumed, some took Occasion to make Reflections again on the Treaters, for subjecting their Country to Taxes, which first they alledged they did not understand, and secondly they were not able to pay.</P>
<P>The Reproaches cast upon the Treaters, the ill Behaviour of some Members, and the Indecencies shown in these Cases, were so Universal, that even Her Majesties High Commissio∣ner did not escape, but was very ill used, which neverthe∣less His Grace with a great deal of Temper suffered, without any Disorder, preferring the publick Peace to all his private Resentments; And by this Prudence pre∣vented those who desired to have things Exasperated, and hoped to see the Resentment of the Government run up first, that they might have something to pretend for the Irregula∣rities which follow'd.</P>
<P>It may also be observed here, That the Printing the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> Laws, Books of Rates, Excises and Customs, which it was very certain would not be understood here, and from which a thousand false Suggestions would every day be raised, whence few People could Answer, was a Design calculated for a great many Ends, which were to be Answer'd in the future Proceedings, and of which we shall hear more hereafter.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="303"/>
A Committee was Nominated also for this Work, and thousands of Difficulties were continually raised in the Mouths of the People, to Expose the Treaty, and Exasperate the People, such as, That the Tax upon Salt was Intolerable, and that it would Destroy the Fishery, and the Poor were Represented to Subsist so much upon Salt, as if it had been one of the greatest parts of their Food.</P>
<P>The Excise on Beer, Ale, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> was Represented as Insup∣portable, and great Pains were taken to prove, that the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> paid 4 <HI>sh.</HI> 9 <HI>d. per</HI> Barrel upon their Table Beer; and that the <HI>Scots</HI> Small Ale must pay equal Excise to the <HI>English</HI> Strong Beer; And this was publickly Printed in the Streets, on purpose to Enrage the People.</P>
<P>It was in vain to offer Calculations on these Heads—; And tho' it was, by the Author of this Work, proved by di∣rect and positive Demonstration, that the Excise of their Ale could, in Proportion, pay no more than it did now, even by the Calculation of the <HI>English</HI> Excises; And that the Expence of Salt, in any House in the Kingdom, could not rise to above 20 <HI>d. per</HI> Head <HI>per Annum,</HI> yet it was in vain; all Calculations of this sort were ridiculed and exposed as false and partial, and the Author maltreated in Print for his Essays on those things, as an Enemy to the Country, and in order to expose him to the Fury of the Rabble, which had particu∣larly mark'd him out for Destruction, in the general Commo∣tions which follow'd.</P>
<P>But all these Calculations appeared afterward to be right, as in their place will more particularly appear.</P>
<P>However, the whole Debate of this Day could not bring them over the Eighteenth Article, the farther Discourse of which was, as <HI>per</HI> the Minute, adjourned, and what inter∣rupted it further, you will see in the next Days Work.</P>
<P>The Salt was an Argument People stuck very closs to, and strove to make it Popular; For the Poor seemed to be con∣cerned in it, and those that espoused it, whatever their Ends were in espousing it, they always made the Relief and Ease of the Poor the main Argument: This was Taking and En∣gaging with the Common People, and as much Use was made of it, as if the Salt had been a principal part of their Food, and the Duty so great, that the Poor must have been starved, if they had payed it—; The Debate, however, had this Effect, that it brought the Parliament to enter into the Consideration of Amendments and Exemptions, which they particularly settled in this Affair, and which the Parliament of <HI>England</HI> easily came into, as will appear in its place.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATION IX.</HEAD>
<P>This whole day was a meer Interruption to the Reading of the Articles, and the House was employed wholly on the Affair of the Rabbles.</P>
<P>The Lord Commissioner having found the encrease of the Mob come to such a Degree, as that the whole City was in Danger, and indeed the whole Constitution would otherwise have been Exposed; His Grace ordered the Guards to enter the City about One of the Clock in the Morning, to assist the Magistrates, by which means the Tumult was Appeased, and the Rabble dispers'd; some of the Rioters had been seized and secured, and the Souldiers kept Post in the City all that Night, the ensuing Day and the Night, and part of this Day, without being Relieved, tho the Weather was exceeding Cold.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="306"/>
The Council had the Day before, Ratified what the Lord Commissioner had done, and it was not doubted but the Par∣liament would do the same; the absolute Necessity of such a proceeding, being, as was thought, enough to satisfie any Body who was not for having the Civil Authority subjected to the Insolencies of the Rabble.</P>
<P>But People were strangely surprized, when they saw this strenuously opposed in the Parliament; and had it not been carryed by a Majority in the House, the Consequences must have terminated in a second Rabble, more Fatal and Furi∣ous than the first.</P>
<P>The Marquess of <HI>A—le</HI> was the first Man who made Objection against it, and pleaded, That it was an Encroach∣ment upon the Liberty of Parliament, and taking away their Freedom of Speech; That it was Awing the House with Souldiers, and bringing upon them Arbitrary Government; and several Speeches were made to this purpose, in which one Noble Person said, He could perceive the Difference al∣ready in the Votes of the House, and that the Influence of the Souldiers had Altered the Matter.</P>
<P>These were hard Sayings indeed, and it was thought a hard Point, that People should call the being subjected to an Un∣govern'd Rabble, Liberty of Parliament, and the Clamours of the Mob, Freedom of Speech; It was plain, if the Guards were not brought up, the Members of Parliament would be Aw'd, and the Treaters Massacred by the Mob; and to place Guards to Suppress Tumults, and Restrain the Head-strong Multitude, was very far from Awing the Parlia∣ment; it being also apparent, that this Guard was intirely Subordinate to the Commands of the Parliament, and were placed to Maintain, not Infringe the Liberty of Speech they spoke of; That no Man could be Influenc'd by Men set on∣ly to keep the Peace, and disperse Rabbles, and in a Case when it was apparent to all the World, the Necessity was such, That, unless those Rabbles were suppress'd, the Par∣liament could not sit at all, nor the Business they were Assembled for be Debated.</P>
<P>The Opposers, however, maintain'd the Dispute a long time; but when they came to the Question, it was appa∣rent, a great many of their Friends, in other Cases yet, were so convinc'd of the Necessity of this, That they Voted against them, and so the Actings of the Lord Com∣missioner, and also of the Council, were Approved, and the Thanks of the House Ordered, as in the Vote.</P>
<P>The Protesters are Named in the Minute, as above; And this, I think, was the first Protest made in Parliament, upon the Affair of the Union.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="307"/>
This Debate, of Course, put off the further Consideration of the Eighteenth Article of the Union, which was the Work of the Day.</P>
<P>There was great Struggling in the House, on Pretence of the Infringing the Privileges of the City of <HI>Edinburgh;</HI> But the Magistrates having declared themselves satisfied in the Necessity of the Case, and the Impossibility of Keeping the Peace without this Method, that Debate was also couch'd in the Protest as above, and every Body acquiesc'd; The Guards continued in their Posts, and the respective Regi∣ments Reliev'd one another with Beat of Drum, as is usual, but the Effect was only Keeping the Peace; No Violence was offered to the Parliament, neither were any Souldiers plac'd at the Door to Awe the Members, much less was any denyed Enterance, or any other Person Access to them, as on other Occasions—; But the Parliament was perfectly Free, Open and Uninterrupted, the Souldiers were a Guard to them, but not a Guard against them, and it was not in the Power of any Person to say, he received the least Affront from them: Indeed the Souldiers appeared wholly Uncon∣cerned in any part of the Affair, they only Executed the Office of a Guard to preserve the Peace, and keep the Government from being Insulted.</P>
<P>And in this peaceable Behaviour of the Souldiery, consisted a great deal of the Success of the Treaty, for this took away all pretence from a party of Men, who aim'd at, and sought for some such Irregularity to complain of, in or∣der to have Protested against the Parliament, as under Re∣straint, and so having a legal Objection against the Proceed∣ings as not Acted in a Free Parliament.</P>
<P>This was a Disappointment to a certain great Person, who proposed a Protest against this very Thing, as an Act of Vio∣lence, and so leaving the House as a Body, pretending they were under the power of the Army; But the Souldiers being so Ordered, as to behave themselves quietly, and only taking Post as a Guard to the City, to preserve the publick Peace; the Doors of Parliament being always free and Uninterrupted, those People were Defeated; and even their own Friends, whom they proposed it to, refused them, acknowledging they could not sustain the Allegation.</P>
<P>I think it is very necessary to be particular in this case, be∣cause I know great Clamours were made, as well in <HI>England</HI> as in <HI>Scotland,</HI> as if the Souldiers, who upon this extraordinary Occasion, were brought into the City, and who did indeed keep Guard in the Parliament Closs, were an Awe and a Ter∣ror to the Parliament, and that consequently it was not a free Parliament.</P>

<DIV2 N="13" TYPE="observation">
<HEAD>OBSERVATION XIII.</HEAD>
<P>The great Question came now to be Determined—, Whether they should go upon the Treaty, or no.</P>
<P>Those that opposed it, would not directly Argue against Reading the Articles at all, &amp; so at once Reject the Treaty; But they began to start a new Scruple, <HI>viz.</HI> Why should it be put upon the Parliament of <HI>Scotland,</HI> to Determine first upon the Treaty? Why should not <HI>England,</HI> where the Treaty had been Form∣ed, and where their Parliament was now to Sit in a few Days; Why should not they first Signify their Consent to the Treaty, and then the Parliament of <HI>Scotland</HI> might Consider, whether they could joyn with them upon the Terms, YEA or NO?</P>
<P>This occasioned great Disputes, and many Speeches were made, endeavouring to shew the Reasonableness of having this Matter first Determin'd in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>It was among other things offered as a sufficient Argu∣ment, That, as it was the Queens Prerogative to Call Parliaments, to Appoint and Limit their Sittings, and to pro∣pose to them any Matters as the Subject of their Meeting, which they should Consult about, not Exclusive of what they should think fit to Debate themselves, Her Majesty had Determined which Parliament should begin upon the Ar∣ticles, by Appointing this Parliament for that End, and had particularly Recommended this Matter to them, and that therefore they ought to go about it.</P>
<P>That the Priority was a Dispute of no Consequence at all, and that they had all the Liberty in the World to Pass or not Pass, Approve or not Approve of the Treaty now, as they should have then; That, if there was any Difference, the Honour was done to <HI>Scotland,</HI> in putting the Treaty first into their Hands, as the Principal Persons, who were supposed to have Objections to make, and that they might
<PB N="24" REF="311"/>
be made intirely easy, in every Thing that was Material, to their Satisfaction.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding all this, they renewed the Debate, and brought it to a Motion in the Parliament, as appears by the Vote, in which they also added the former Suggestion of Consulting their Constituents; And some Members alledg∣ed, they had express Directions from their Principals, and the Countries they Represented, Restraining, and positively Obliging them, not to Enter upon the Treaty.</P>
<P>This brought Things to a great Height, and some Mem∣bers, <HI>as was said,</HI> began to Talk of Protesting, and Leaving the Parliament, but they had more Wisdom than that came to—; They indeed very earnestly press'd this Motion, which was in short to Obtain a Delay, and that made them fly from one Argument to another.</P>
<P>Together with their Arguments, and to Second their Pro∣posal of Consulting Principals, they brought in Addresses from the several Places mentioned above, and vehemently urged, That it appeared by them, that it was the Sense of the People, that the whole Nation was against it, and that they ought not to Poceed without their Assent.</P>
<P>Here it was Noted, That the Address from <HI>Mid-Lothian</HI> was Signed by not above Twelve of the Gentlemen, or there∣about, tho' there were above Two Hundred Gentlemen in that County; And that therefore it seemed the Argument, of its being the Sense of the Nation, must be very ill Grounded.</P>
<P>At length they dropt the Debate, and obtained the pre∣vious Question, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Parliament should immediately proceed to Reading the Articles.</P>
<P>But then a new Project was set on Foot; and it was an odd thing to see, that after a long Debate whether the Articles should be Read <HI>at all</HI> or no, it occasioned another Question, and no small Debate upon it, which End of them they should begin at.</P>
<P>When they had gotten over the Question as before, for Reading, they fell out which Article they should Read first; the Party which had at first opposed Reading them all, now struggled to begin in the middle of the Treaty, the Rea∣son was, as they alledged, they were for Examining the Particulars before they Voted the General. The first Article con∣tain'd, That from and after the first Day of <HI>May,</HI> the two Kingdoms should be United, <HI>&amp;c. This they would have de∣layed;</HI> and then followed the Conditions which they would have be agreed first of all.</P>
<P>Others alledged, that it would be needless to enter in∣to the Particulars till it was agreed, whether they should be UNITED or No; and therefore it was necessary to Examine the first Article in its order, not only because it was the first, but because it was most rational to Determine, whether there
<PB N="25" REF="312"/>
should be an Union or no, before they descended to the Par∣ticulars, because, if all the Articles were agreed to, yet if it should be so precarious as to state the Question afterwards, whether there should be a Union or no, it might at once ren∣der all their Labour Fruitless.</P>
<P>Upon this Debate, they resolved, it was first necessary to get over the main Article, Whether there should be a Union or not, before they entred into the Merits of the Particulars, or Examined the Conditions; and they only Read the Ar∣ticle to finish the Debate, and prevent any more Difficulty.</P>

<P>The first Article of Union was again Read, and thereupon a Motion was offered in thir Terms, That it be agreed to, in the first place, To proceed to take the first Article of the Union to Conside∣ration, with this Provision, That if the other Articles of Union be not adjusted by the Parliament, then the Agreeing to, and Appro∣ving of the First, shall be of no Effect; And that immediately after the said first Article, the Parliament will proceed to an <HI>Act For security of the Doctrine, Discipline, Worship and Government of the Church, as now by Law Established within this Kingdom:</HI> And after some Debate thereon, there was a state of a Vote offered, Approve of the Motion, <HI>Yea</HI> or <HI>No.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Adjourn'd till</HI> Monday <HI>next at Ten a Clock.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="14" TYPE="observation">
<HEAD>OBSERVATION XIV.</HEAD>
<P>The first Article was now Read, and all the Opposition hitherto made, had been over. But two plausible Things re∣main'd; one was, To Debate whether it should be so settled that if all the Articles were not Concluded, none of them which were Considered, should be of any Force; this was so plausible, no Body could withstand it.</P>
<P>Then they Objected in the Name of the Church, on the Occasion brought before them formerly, <HI>viz.</HI> The Act of Se∣curity. Unhappy was the Condition at this time of the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> if what seem'd to appear, had been her real Case, <HI>viz.</HI> To have her greatest Enemies be her best Solicitors, as if she had been so desperate, that even those that formerly Assist∣ed to pull her down, were the only seeming Advocates for her present Establishment.</P>
<P>Or else surely Her Case was very happy, on the other hand, that Her Establishment was so visibly necessary at this time, that even Her apparent Enemies were careful to support Her.</P>
<P>I shall enter no further into the Mystery of it here, the Parlia∣ment had Voted to consider the Address of the Commission, before any thing was Concluded, and whether that word, <HI>Concluded,</HI> was to signifie before they Voted any Article, or before the whole Union was Concluded, was now Immateri∣al; and tho' it was expresly said in the Vote of <HI>October</HI> 17, That it should be before the Union was Concluded, yet it was Moved now, and the Parliament was so willing to do every thing for the Satisfaction of the Nation, that they Resolved to go upon it immediately after the passing the first Article.</P>
<P>The Party that still Opposed, were for going on the Affair of the Church, before any of the Articles were Concluded on, alledging, That if the Security of the Church could not be agreed on, the Union could not be entered upon; but it was returned to that, That just on the contrary, it was necessary first to Vote the General, Whether there should be a Union or no in the Terms of the Treaty, which General was included in the first Article, and it was easie to be seen, that if that Ar∣ticle was Voted against, the Union was Rejected; and if the Union was Rejected, there was then no need for Discoursing on the Act of Security for the Church.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="314"/>
This was too strong a way of Reasoning to be Resisted, and therefore when it came to the Question, it past, as <HI>per</HI> the Minute.<Q>That it be agreed to, in the first place, To proceed to take the first Article of Ʋnion to Consideration, with this Provision, That if the other Articles of Ʋnion be not ad∣justed by the Parliament, then the Agreeing to, and Appro∣ving of the First, shall be of no Effect; And that imme∣diately after the said first Article, the Parliament will pro∣ceed to an Act for Security of the Doctrine, Discipline, Wor∣ship and Government of the Church, as now by Law Esta∣blished within this Kingdom.</Q></P>
<P>And now the first Article came upon the Stage, and the first Brush it met with was, That it was against the Claim of Right, as <HI>per</HI> the Minute.</P>
<P>This was a Surprizing Blow indeed, and made the House immediately Call for the Claim of Right, but that which was Remarkable upon Reading the Claim of Right was, it became necessary to Read the Letter of the Convention at that time sent to King <HI>William,</HI> in which, the Estates then met, humbly desired His Majesty, to set on Foot an Union in the very Sense and Meaning of this Incorporation of the Kingdoms, as the only Happiness the Kingdom desired.<Q>We are most sensible of Your Majesties Kindness, and Fatherly Care to both Your Kingdoms, in promoving their Ʋnion, which we hope hath been Reserved to be Accomplish∣ed by You; That as both Kingdoms are Ʋnited in one Head and Soveraign, so they may become one Body Politick, one Nation, to be Represented in one Parliament. And to te∣stifie our Readiness to Comply with Your Majesty in that Mat∣ter; We have Nominated Commissioners to Treat the Terms of an Entire and Perpetual Ʋnion betwixt the Two King∣doms, with Reservation to us of our Church Government, as it shall be Established at the Time of the Ʋnion. These Commissioners do wait Your Majesties Approbation and Call, That they may Meet and Treat with the Commissioners to be Appointed for <HI>England,</HI> at what Time and Place Your Majesty shall Appoint. And if any Difficulty shall arise in the Treaty, We do, upon our Part, Refer the Determination thereof to Your Majesty. And we do Assure our selves, from Your Majesties Prudence and Goodness, of a Happy Conclu∣sion to that Important Affair, so as the same may be Agreed to, and Ratified by Your Majesty in Your first Parliament.</Q></P>
<P>This indeed occasioned a long Debate and much Warmth on both sides, which held the House very late; And after Reading all the Papers, the Inconsistency of the Union with the Claim of Right was thorowly Examin'd, where it could not but be very remarkable to observe some Gentlemen giv∣ing a Sanction to the Claim of Right, who never before ac∣knowleg'd
<PB N="28" REF="315"/>
it, owning it now as a Sacred Foundation, in or∣der to oppose it to the Scheme of Union now drawn; which being of more Fatal Consequence to their Real Design, as well as Party, they were brought to the Necessity of Closing with the first to Confront the last; so Playing one against another, Recognizing the Revolution as the lesser Evil to Repulse the Union, which they saw plainly Aim'd at the Foundation, Struck at the Root, and must for ever Foreclose <HI>Jacobitism</HI> and <HI>Prelacy,</HI> the two Columes which supported their Cause—. The Reasonings here in the House began with much Calmness; Immediately after Reading the Ar∣ticle, Mr. <HI>Seton</HI> of <HI>Pitmedden</HI> took the Opportunity to say, That, having had the Honour to be one of the Commissio∣ners for the Treaty, he thought it his Duty to give some Rea∣sons, which mov'd him to Approve that Article at <HI>London;</HI> That he was perswaded, there were several Members so Pre∣judiced against all the Articles, that he could not hope from them a Favourable Audience. And that what he had to say to the present Subject of Debate, had been thought upon, when he Signed the Treaty; therefore he would presume to make Use of his Papers, hoping, tho' his Reasons could not convince any Member, yet they might serve to Vindicate his Conduct to Posterity. Then he proceeded, and the Second of <HI>November</HI> 1706, made the following Speech.<Q><P><HI>My Lord Chancellor,</HI></P>
<P>THis Honourable House has heard the several <HI>Articles of the Treaty of Ʋnion</HI> twice Read, has spent a considerable time in Discoursing to each of them, and after much Debate is come to Examine and Determine upon the First: Notwithstand∣ing all the Arguments offered against it, I cannot find the least Mo∣tive for Altering the Opinion I had at Signing this Article, having had the Honour to be one of the Commissioners Appointed by Her Majesty for that End; but that I may give all Satisfaction to every Member, I shall humbly offer in a plain manner my Thoughts in relation to it.</P>
<P><HI>My Lord,</HI> This Article is the Foundation of the whole Treaty, and the Approving or Rejecting of it must Determine Union or no Union betwixt both Kingdoms.</P>
<P>How far the Approving this Article conduces to our Happiness, appears evidently, by considering the three different Ways propo∣sed for Retriving the Languishing Condition of this Nation; which are, That we continue under the same Sovereign with <HI>England,</HI> with Limitations on his Prerogative as King of <HI>Scot∣land;</HI> That the two Kingdoms be Incorporated into one, or that they be entirely separated.</P>
<P>That the Union of Crowns with Limitations on the Successor is not sufficient to Rectifie the bad State of this Nation, appears from these Positions founded on Reason and Experience.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="316"/>
Two Kingdoms subject to one Sovereign, having different Inte∣rests, the nearer these are one to another, the greater Jealousie and Emulation will be betwixt 'em.</P>
<P>Every Monarch, having two or more Kingdoms, will be obliged to prefer the Counsel and Interest of the Stronger to that of the Weaker: And the greater Disparity of Power and Riches there is betwixt these Kingdoms, the greater influence the more powerful Nation will have on the Sovereign. Notwithstanding these Positi∣ons, I shall suppose the Parliament of <HI>Scotland</HI> is Vested with the Power of making Peace and War, of Rewarding and Punishing Persons of all Ranks, of Levying Troops, and of the <HI>Negative</HI> it self.</P>
<P>I cou'd show the Inconveniencies that must attend such a State of Government, in Disposal of Places and Managing Publick Affairs; I cou'd likewise show the Improbability of Attaining such Conditions, or keeping 'em if attained; but laying aside such Considerations, my humble Opinion is, That we cannot reap any Benefit from these Conditions of Government, without the Assistance of <HI>England:</HI> And the People thereof will never be convinced to promote the Interest of <HI>Scotland,</HI> 'till both King∣doms are Incorporated into One: So that I conceive such a State of Limitations to be no better for <HI>Scotland,</HI> than if it were intire∣ly separated from <HI>England,</HI> in which State there's little Appearance of procuring any Remedy to our present Circumstances, which appears from these uncontraverted Positions.</P>
<P>The People and Government of <HI>Scotland</HI> must be Richer or Poorer, as they have Plenty or Scarcity of Money, the common Measure of Trade.</P>
<P>No Money or Things of Value can be purchased in the Course of Commerce: but where there's a Force to protect it.</P>
<P>This Nation is behind all other Nations of <HI>Europe</HI> for many years, with respect to the Effects of an extended Trade.</P>
<P>This Nation being Poor, and without Force to protect it's Commerce, cannot reap great Advantages by it, till it partake of the Trade and Protection of some powerful Neighbour Nation, that can Communicate both these.</P>
<P>To Illustrate this last Position, I shall give a short View of the State of Commerce we must needs be in, with respect to our Neighbour Nations, supposing an entire Separation from <HI>Eng∣land.</HI></P>
<P>The ordinary Mean, whereby we can flourish in Wealth, is, That Ballance which arises from the Exchange of our Natural or Artificial Product with other Places: But we have no Valuable Branch of Export, which does not Interfere with the like Com∣modity, in some more powerful Neighbour Nation, who's Inte∣rest it is to Suppress or Discourage our Commodity, for Raising the Value of its own; so that there's no Demonstrable Security for the Vent and Encouragement of any Branch of our Export.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="317"/>
Can it be expected, That <HI>Holland</HI> will suffer us to Improve our Fishery, which is to them a Nursery for Seamen, a Livelyhood to many Families, and an immense Treasure to the Publick?</P>
<P>If we Traffick with <HI>England;</HI> our Linnen-Cloth, Cattle, and Coals will be Discouraged, at least, after the same manner that we discourage Export from thence. If we Traffick with <HI>Muscovy, Sweden, Denmark, Poland, Germany, France, Spain, Portugal</HI> and <HI>Italy,</HI> the Sale of our Commodities will be of small Value in these Places; seing the <HI>Dutch</HI> or <HI>English,</HI> by their Increase of Trade, are capable to serve them with most of the like Goods, cheaper and better than we.</P>
<P>Let us look to any other Part of the World, for Vent to our Product, and we'll find other Nations have prevented us.</P>
<P>If we attempt the <HI>East-India-</HI>Trade, that is already Enhansed by the <HI>Dutch, English, French, Spaniards</HI> or <HI>Portuguese,</HI> from whom we must expect Opposition, they themselves Opposing one another daily; and we of no Force to Debate the same, with the most Inconsiderable of them.</P>
<P>The Trade of <HI>Africae</HI> is, for the most part, of small Value; and every Province of <HI>America</HI> is claimed as Property, by some powerful <HI>European</HI> Nation.</P>
<P>If it be said, That <HI>Scotland</HI> may make Alliance with one of its Neighbour Nations for Protection; that Alliance must be with <HI>Holland, England</HI> or <HI>France:</HI> Other Countries being so Remote or Poor, that their Friendships can be of little Use to us.</P>
<P>With <HI>Holland</HI> we can have no Advantageous Alliance, because its chief Branch of Trade is the same with ours; with the <HI>Eng∣lish,</HI> we can expect no profitable Friendship, for they being our near Neighbours, will be Jealous of our Increase in Power; and from <HI>France,</HI> few Advantages can be reap'd, till the old Offensive and Defensive <HI>League</HI> be revived betwixt <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Scotland,</HI> which wou'd give Umbrage to the <HI>English,</HI> and occasion a War betwixt them and us. And allowing the <HI>Scots,</HI> in such a Juncture, with the Assistance of <HI>France,</HI> to Conquer <HI>England; Scotland,</HI> by that Conquest, cou'd not hope to better its present State; for 'tis more than probable, the Conquerour wou'd make his Residence in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> as formerly the Northern People used to do in their Southern Expeditions.</P>
<P>From these Considerations I conceive, That this Nation, by an entire Separation from <HI>England,</HI> cannot extend it's Trade, so as to raise its Power in Proportion to other Trafficking Nations in <HI>Eu∣rope;</HI> but that hereby we may be in Danger of returning to that <HI>Gothick</HI> Constitution of Government, wherein our Forefathers were, which was frequently attended with Feuds, Murders, De∣predations and Rebellions.</P>
<P><HI>My Lord,</HI> I'm sorry, That, in place of Things, we Amuse our selves with Words; for my part, I comprehend no durable Uni∣on betwixt <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>England,</HI> but that expressed in this Ar∣ticle
<PB N="31" REF="318"/>
by <HI>One Kingdom,</HI> that is to say, One People, One Civil Go∣vernment and One Interest.</P>
<P>'Tis true, the Words, <HI>Federal Ʋnion,</HI> are become very Fashion∣able, and may be handsomely fitted to delude unthinking People; But if any Member of this House will give himself the Trouble to examine what Conditions or Articles are understood by these words, and reduce them into any kind of Federal Compacts, whereby distinct Nations have been United: I'll presume to say, These will be found Impracticable, or of very little Use to us.</P>
<P>But to put that Matter in a clear Light, these <HI>Queries</HI> ought to be duly Examined, Whether a Federal Union be Practicable be∣twixt two Nations accustomed to a Monarchical Government? Whe∣ther there can be any sure Guaranty projected for the Observance of the Articles of a Federal Compact, stipulated betwixt two Nations; whereof the one is much Superior to the other in Riches, Numbers of People, and an extended Commerce? Whether the Ad∣vantages of a Federal Union do Ballance its Disadvantages? Whe∣ther the <HI>English</HI> will accept a Federal Union, supposing it to be for the true Interest of both Nations? Whether any Federal Compact betwixt <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>England,</HI> is sufficient to secure the Peace of this Island, or Fortify it against the Intrigues and Invasions of its Foreign Enemies? And whether <HI>England</HI> in Prudence, ought to Communicate its Trade and Protection to this Nation, till both Kingdoms are Incorporated in one?</P>
<P> To clear this last <HI>Querie,</HI> I shall offer a Remark from History.</P>
<P>Of two Independent and distinct Kingdoms United by a Federal Compact under one Sovereign, the Weaker to preserve its Interest, has some times separated from the Stronger, unless prevented by open Force, or secret Influence on its Government.</P>
<P><HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Portugal</HI> were subject to the same Sovereign, <HI>Philip</HI> II. And notwithstanding the <HI>Portuguese</HI> got most Advantagious Conditi∣ons from <HI>Spain,</HI> they no sooner found a favourable Opportunity in the Reign of <HI>Philip</HI> IV. than they revolted from their Allegiance, and Elected the Duke of <HI>Braganza</HI> for their King.</P>
<P><HI>Sweden</HI> and <HI>Denmark</HI> were United by a Federal Compact under one Monarch, but the <HI>Swedes</HI> judging a Separation more for their Interest, broke off, and chose <HI>Gustavus</HI> the 1. for their King.</P>
<P><HI>My Lord,</HI> I should now consider an Incorporating Union, as it is expressed in this Article by <HI>One Kingdom;</HI> but that I may not take up the time of the House, I shall only give one Historical Re∣mark with Relation to it.</P>
<P>Two or more distinct Kingdoms or States, by incorporating in∣to one Kingdom, have continued under the same Sovereign, en∣joying equally the Protection of his Government, and every part of the Body Politick, tho never so far remov'd from the Seat of Government, has Flourished in Wealth in proportion to the Value of it's Natural Product, or the Industry of its Inhabitants. To prove this Remark there are many Examples.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="319"/>
<HI>Spain</HI> was formerly divided into several Kingdoms, ten where∣of are Incorporated into the one Kingdom of <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P><HI>France</HI> was formerly divided into 12 States, which are Incorpo∣rated into the one Kingdom of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P><HI>England</HI> was formerly divided into seven Kingdoms, which are Incorporated into the one Kingdom of <HI>England; Scotland</HI> it self was formerly divided into two Kingdoms, which at present are Incorporated into the one Kingdom of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>I cou'd give some Account of the particular Advantages we'll obtain by an Incorporating Union with <HI>England,</HI> but there will be occasions to Discourse of these, as the other Articles fall under the Consideration of this Parliament. In general, I may assert, That by this Union, we'll have Access to all the Advantages in Commerce, the <HI>English</HI> enjoy; we'll be capable, by a good Go∣vernment, to improve our National Product, for the benefit of the whole Island; and we'll have our Liberty, Property and Religion, secured under the Protection of one Sovereign, and one Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain.</HI></P>
<P>Now, <HI>My Lord,</HI> If Limitations on the Successor can be of little or no Use to us; if an entire Separation from <HI>England</HI> brings no Advantage to this Nation: and if all Federal Compacts, as we are stated, have insuperable Difficulties, which in some measure I have cleared, there is but one of two left to our Choise, <HI>to wit,</HI> That both Kingdoms be United into one, or that we continue un∣der the same Sovereign with <HI>England</HI> as we have done these 100 years past. This last I conceive to be a very ill State, for by it (if Experience be convincing) we cannot expect any of the Advantages of an Incorporating Union; but on the contrair, Our Sovereignty and Independency will be eclipsed, the number of our Nobility will Encrease, Our Commons will be Oppressed, Our Parliaments will be influenced by <HI>England,</HI> the Execution of our Laws will be neglected; Our Peace will be interrupted by Factions for Places and Pensions; Luxury together with Poverty (tho' strange) will invade us; Numbers of <HI>Scots</HI> will withdraw themselves to Foreign Countries; and all the other Effects of Bad Government must necessa∣rily attend us.</P>
<P>Let us therefore, <HI>My Lord,</HI> after all these Considerations ap∣prove this Article: and when the whole Treaty shall be duly Exa∣mined and Ratified, I'm hopeful, this Parliament will return their most Dutiful Acknowledgments to Her Majesty, for Her Royal En∣deavours in promoting a Lasting Union betwixt both Nations.</P></Q></P>
<P>Next spoke the Lord <HI>Beilhaven,</HI> but without answering what had been said by M. <HI>Seton,</HI> he made a long premeditate Speech, the Nature of which will be best understood by Reading it at length, which being so much talk'd of in the World, I have also inserted here, tho' I shall not trouble the Reader with many more Speeches in this whole History.<Q><PB N="33" REF="320"/>
<P><HI>My Lord Chancellor,</HI></P>
<P>WHEN I consider this Affair of an UNION betwixt the Two Nations, as it is express'd in the several <HI>Articles</HI> thereof, and now the Subject of our Deliberation at this time; I find my Mind crowded with variety of very Melancholy Thoughts, and <HI>I</HI> think it my Duty to disburden my self of some of them, by lay∣ing them before, and exposing them to the serious Consideration of this Honourable House.</P>
<P><HI>I</HI> think, <HI>I</HI> see <HI>a Free and Independent Kingdom</HI> delivering up That, which all the World hath been fighting for, since the days of <HI>Nimrod;</HI> yea, that for which most of all the Empires, King∣doms, States, Principalities and Dukedoms of <HI>Europe,</HI> are at this very time engaged in the most Bloody and Cruel Wars that ever were, <HI>to wit,</HI> A Power to Manage their own Affairs by themselves, without the Assistance and Counsel of any other.</P>
<P>I think, I see <HI>a National Church,</HI> founded upon a Rock, secured by a <HI>Claim of Right,</HI> hedged and fenced about by the strictest and pointedest Legal Sanction that Sovereignty could contrive, volun∣tarily descending into a Plain, upon an equal level with <HI>Jews, Papists, Socinians, Arminians, Anabaptists,</HI> and other Sectaries, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>I think I see <HI>the Noble and Honourable Peerage of Scotland,</HI> whose Valiant Predecessors led Armies against their Enemies upon their own proper Charges and Expenses, now divested of their Followers and Vassalages, and put upon such an Equal Foot with their Vas∣sals, that I think I see a petty <HI>English</HI> Excise-man receive more Homage and Respect, than what was paid formerly to their <HI>quondam Maccallanmores.</HI></P>
<P>I think I see <HI>the present Peers of</HI> Scotland, whose Noble Ancestors conquered Provinces, over-run Countries, reduc'd and subjected Towns and fortify'd Places, exacted Tribute through the greatest part of <HI>England,</HI> now walking in the Court of Requests like so many <HI>English</HI> Attornies, laying aside their Walking Swords when in Com∣pany with the <HI>English</HI> Peers, lest their Self-defence should be found Murder.</P>
<P>I think I see <HI>the Honourable Estate of Barons,</HI> the bold Asserters of the Nation's Rights and Liberties in the worst of Times, now setting a Watch upon their Lips and a Guard upon their Tongues, lest they be found guilty of <HI>Scandalum Magnatum.</HI></P>
<P>I think I see <HI>the Royal State of Burrows</HI> walking their desolate Streets, hanging down their Heads under Disappointments; wormed out of all the Branches of their old Trade, uncertain what hand to turn to, necessitate to become Prentices to their unkind Neigh∣bours; and yet after all finding their Trade so fortified by Com∣panies, and secured by Prescriptions, that they despair of any success therein.</P>
<P>I think I see <HI>our Learned Judges</HI> laying aside their Practiques and Decisions, studying the Common Law of <HI>England,</HI> gravelled with Certioraries, <HI>Nisi prius's,</HI> Writs of Error, Verdicts indovar,
<PB N="34" REF="321"/>
<HI>Ejectione firmae,</HI> Injunctions, Demurrs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and frighted with Ap∣peals and Avocations, because of the new Regulations and Recti∣fications they may meet with.</P>
<P>I think I see <HI>the Valiant and Gallant Soldiery</HI> either sent to learn the Plantation Trade Abroad; or at Home Petitioning, for a small Subsistance as the Reward of their honourable Exploits, while their old Cores are broken, the common Soldiers left to Beg, and the youngest <HI>English</HI> Corps kept standing.</P>
<P>I think I see <HI>the Honest Industrious Tradesman</HI> loaded with new Taxes, and Impositions, disappointed of the Equivalents, drink∣ing Water in place of Ale, eating his sat-less Pottage, Petitioning for Encouragement to his Manufacturies, and Answered by counter Petitions:</P>
<P>In short, I think I see <HI>the Laborious Plew-man,</HI> with his Corns spoiling upon his Hands, for want of Sale, Cursing the day of his Birth, dreading the Expense of his Burial, and uncertain whether to Marry or do worse.</P>
<P>I think I see the Incureable Difficulties of the <HI>Landedmen,</HI> fet∣tered under the Golden Chain of Equivalents, their pretty Daugh∣ters Petitioning for want of Husbands, and their Sons for want of Imployments.</P>
<P>I think I see <HI>our Mariners,</HI> delivering up their Ships to their <HI>Dutch</HI> Partners; and what through Presses and Necessity, earning their Bread as Underlings in the Royal <HI>English</HI> Navy.</P>
<P>But above all, <HI>My Lord,</HI> I think I see <HI>our Ancient Mother</HI> CALEDONIA, like <HI>Caesar</HI> sitting in the midst of our Senate, Rufully looking round about her, Covering her self with her Royal Garment, attending the Fatal Blow, and breathing out her last with a <HI>Et tu quoque mi fili.</HI></P>
<P>Are not these, <HI>My Lord,</HI> very afflicting Thoughts? And yet they are but the least part Suggested to me by these Dishonourable Articles; should not the Consideration of these things vivifie these <HI>dry Bones</HI> of ours? Should not the Memory of our Noble Prede∣cessors <HI>Valour and Constancie,</HI> rouse up our drouping Spirits? Are our Noble Predecessors Souls got so far into the <HI>English Cabbage-Stock and Colliflowers,</HI> that we should shew the least Inclination that way? Are our Eyes so Blinded? Are our Ears so Deafned? Are our Hearts so Hardned? Are our Tongues so Faltered? Are our Hands so Fettered, that in this our day, I say, <HI>My Lord, That in this our day, that we should not mind the things, that concern the very Being and Well-being of our Ancient Kingdom, before the day be hid from our Eyes.</HI></P>
<P>No, <HI>My Lord,</HI> GOD <HI>forbid, Man's Extremity is</HI> GOD's <HI>Oppor∣tunity: He is a present Help in time of need; and a Deliverer, and that right early.</HI> Some unforeseen Providence will fall out, that may cast the Ballance; some <HI>Joseph</HI> or other will say, <HI>Why do ye strive together, since you are Brethren?</HI> None can Destroy <HI>Scotland,</HI> save <HI>Scotland</HI>'s self; hold your Hands from the Pen, you are Se∣cure. Some <HI>Judah</HI> or other will say, <HI>Let not our hands be upon</HI>
<PB N="35" REF="322"/>
<HI>the Lad, he is our Brother.</HI> There will be a <HI>JEHOVAH-JIREH</HI> and <HI>some Ram will be caught in the Thicket,</HI> when the bloody Knife is at our Mothers Throat; Let us up then, <HI>My Lord,</HI> and let our Noble Patriots behave themselves like Men, and we know not how soon a Blessing may come.</P>
<P><HI>My Lord,</HI> I wish from my Heart, that this my Vision prove not as true, as my Reasons for it are probable; I design not at this time to enter into the merits of any one particular Article, I intend this Discourse, as an Introduction to what I may afterwards say upon the whole Debate, as it falls in before this Honourable House; and therefore, in the further Prosecution of what I have to say, I shall insist upon some few particulars, very necessary to be understood, before we enter unto the Detail of so Important a Matter.</P>
<P>I shall therefore in the <HI>first place,</HI> Endeavour to Encourage a free and full Deliberation, without Animosities and Heats; in the <HI>next place,</HI> I shall Endeavour to make an Enquiry into the Nature and Source of the Unnatural and Dangerous Divisions that are now on Foot within this Isle, with some Motives shewing, that it is our Interest to lay them aside, at this time. Then I shall Enquire into the Reasons which have induced the two Nations to enter into a Treaty of Union at this time, with some Considerations and Meditations, with Relation to the Beha∣viour of the Lords Commissioners of the two Kingdoms, in the Management of this Great Concern. And lastly, I shall propose a Method, by which we shall most distinctly, and without Confu∣fusion, go through the several Articles of this Treaty, without un∣necessary Repetitions or Loss of Time. And all this with all De∣ference, and under the Correction of this Honourable House.</P>
<P><HI>My Lord Chancellor,</HI> The greatest Honour that was done unto a <HI>Roman,</HI> was to allow him the Glory of a Triumph; the great∣est and most dishonourable Punishment was that of <HI>Paricide:</HI> He that was Guilty of <HI>Paricide,</HI> was beaten with Rods upon his naked Body, till the Blood gusht out of all the Veins of his Body; then he was sowed up in a Leathern Sack called a <HI>Culeus,</HI> with a Cock, a Viper, and an Ape, and thrown Headlong into the Sea.</P>
<P><HI>My Lord, Patricide</HI> is a greater Crime than <HI>Paricide,</HI> all the World over.</P>
<P>In a Triumph, <HI>My Lord,</HI> when the Conqueror was Riding in his Triumphal Chariot, Crowned with Lawrels, Adorned with Trophies, and Applauded with Huzza's, there was a <HI>Monitor</HI> ap∣pointed to stand behind him, to warn, Not to be High-minded, nor Puffed up with Overveening Thoughts of himself; and to his Chariot were tied a Whip and a Bell, to mind him, That, for all his Glory and Grandeur, he was Accountable to the People for his Administration, and would be Punished as other Men, if found Guilty.</P>
<P>The greatest Honour amongst us, <HI>My Lord,</HI> is to Represent the Sovereign's Sacred Person in Parliament; and, in one particular,
<PB N="36" REF="323"/>
it appears to be greater than that of a Triumph; because the whole Legislative Power seems to be wholly Intrusted with him: If he give the Royal Assent to an Act of the Estates, it becomes a Law Obligatory upon the Subject, tho' contrary or without any Instructi∣ons from the Sovereign: If he refuse the Royal Assent to a Vote in Parliament, it cannot be a Law, tho' he has the Sovereign's particular and positive Instructions for it.</P>
<P>His Grace the Duke of <HI>Queensberry,</HI> who now Represents Her <HI>Majesty</HI> in this Session of Parliament, hath had the Honour of that Great Trust, as often, if not more than any <HI>Scots</HI> Man ever had; He hath been the Favorite of two Successive Sovereigns; and I cannot but commend his Constancy and Perseverance, that, notwithstanding his former Difficulties and unsuccessful Attempts, and maugre some other Specialities not yet determined, that his Grace has yet had the Resolution, to undertake the most unpopu∣lar Measures last: If his Grace succeed in this Affair of an Union, and that it prove for the Happiness and Welfare of the Nation, then he justly Merits to have a Statue of Gold erected for himself: but if it shall tend to the intire Destruction &amp; Abolition of our Na∣tion; and that we the Nation's Trustees shall go into it; then I must say, That a Whip and a Bell, a Cock, a Viper, and an Ape, are but too small Punishments for any such bold unnatural Undertaking and Complaisance.</P>
<P>That I may path a way, <HI>My Lord,</HI> to a full, calm and free Reasoning upon this Affair, which is of the last Consequence un∣to this Nation; I shall mind this Honourable House, that we are the Successors of our Noble Predecessors who founded our Mo∣narchy, framed our Laws, amended, altered and corrected them from time to time, as the Affairs and Circumstances of the Nation did require, without the Assistance or Advice of any Foreign Power or Potentate, and who, during the time of 2000 Years, have handed them down to us a free Independent Nation, with the Hazard of their Lives and Fortunes; Shall not we then ar∣gue for that, which our Progenitors have purchased for us at so dear a Rate, and with so much Immortal Honour and Glory? GOD forbid. Shall the Hazard of a Father unbind the Ligaments of a Dumb Son's Tongue; and shall we hold our Peace, when our <HI>Patria</HI> is in Danger? I speak this, <HI>My Lord,</HI> That I may incourage every Individual Member of this House, to speak their Mind freely. There are many Wise and Prudent Men amongst us, who think it not worth their while to open their Mouths; there are others, who can speak very well, and to good Purpose, who shelter themselves under the shameful Cloak of Silence, from a Fear of the Frowns of Great Men and Parties. I have observed, <HI>My Lord,</HI> by my Experience, the greatest Number of Speakers in the most Trivial Affairs; and it will always prove so, while we come not to the right Understanding of our Oath <HI>de fideli,</HI> where∣by we are bound not only to give our Vote, but our Faithful Advice in Parliament, as we should <HI>Answer to GOD;</HI> and in our
<PB N="37" REF="324"/>
Ancient Laws, the Representatives of the Honourable Barons and the Royal Burrows are termed Spokesmen: It lyes upon your Lordships therefore, particularly to take notice of such, whose Modesty makes them Bashful to Speak. Therefore I shall leave it upon you, and conclude this Point, with a very Memorable Say∣ing, of an Honest private Gentleman, to a great <HI>Queen,</HI> upon Occasion of a State Project, contrived by an able Statesman, and the Favorite to a great <HI>King,</HI> against a Peaceable Obedient People, because of the Diversity of their Laws and Constitutions. <HI>If at this time thou hold thy Peace, Salvation shall come to the People from another place, but thou and thy House shall perish.</HI> I leave the Application to each particular Member of this House.</P>
<P><HI>My Lord,</HI> I come now to consider our <HI>Divisions.</HI> We are under the Happy Reign (Blessed be GOD) of the <HI>Best of Queens,</HI> Who has no Evil Design against the meanest of Her Subjects, Who Loves all Her People, and is equally Beloved by them again; and yet, that, under the Happy Influence of our most Excellent <HI>Queen,</HI> there should be such Divisions and Factions, more dange∣rous and threatning to Her Dominions, than if we were under an Arbitrary Government, is most strange and unaccountable. Un∣der an Arbitrary Prince, all are willing to Serve, because all are under a Necessity to Obey, whether they will or not. He chooses therefore whom he will, without respect to either Parties or Facti∣ons; and if he think fit to take the Advices of his Councils or Parliaments, every Man speaks his Mind freely, and the Prince re∣ceives the Faithful Advice of his People, without the Mixture of Self-designs: If he prove a Good Prince, the Government is easy; if Bad, either Death or a Revolution brings a Deliverance. Whereas here, <HI>My Lord,</HI> there appears no End of our Misery, if not prevented in time; Factions are now become Independent, and have got Footing in Councils, in Parliaments, in Treaties, in Armies, in Incorporations, in Families, among Kindred, yea Man and Wife are not free from their Political Jarrs.</P>
<P>It remains therefore, <HI>My Lord,</HI> that I enquire into the Nature of these things, and since the Names give us not the Right Idea of the thing, I am afraid I will have Difficulty to make my self well understood.</P>
<P>The Names generally used to denote the Factions, are <HI>Whig</HI> and <HI>Torie,</HI> as obscure as that of the <HI>Guelfs</HI> and <HI>Gibelins:</HI> Yea, <HI>My Lord,</HI> they have different Significations, as they are applyed to Factions in each Kingdom, a <HI>Whig</HI> in <HI>England</HI> is a Heterogene∣ous Creature, in <HI>Scotland</HI> he is all of a piece; a <HI>Tory</HI> in <HI>England</HI> is all of a piece and a <HI>Statesman,</HI> in <HI>Scotland</HI> he is quite other∣ways, an Anti-courteour and Anti-statesman.</P>
<P>A <HI>Whig</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> appears to be somewhat like <HI>Nebuchadnez∣zar</HI>'s Image of different Mettals, different Classes, different Prin∣ciples and different Designs; yet take them all together, they are like a piece of fine mixed Droggat of different Threeds, some Finer, some Courser, which after all make a comely Appearance,
<PB N="38" REF="325"/>
and an agreeable Suit. A <HI>Tory</HI> is like a piece of Loyal-made <HI>English</HI> Cloath, the true Staple of the Nation, all of a Threed: yet if we look narrowly into it, we shall perceive Diversity of Colours, which, according to the Various Situations and Positions, makes Various Appearances; sometimes <HI>Tory</HI> is like the Moon in its Full, as appeared in the Affair of the <HI>Bill of the Occasional Conformity;</HI> upon other occasions it appears to be under Cloud, and as if it were Eclipsed by a greater Body, as it did in the Design of the Calling over the Illustrious Princess <HI>Sophia.</HI> However, by this we may see their designs are to outshoot <HI>Whig</HI> in his own Bow.</P>
<P><HI>Whig</HI> in <HI>Scotland</HI> is a true blew <HI>Presbyterian,</HI> who, without Con∣sidering Time or Power, will <HI>venture their All for the Kirk:</HI> but something less for the State. <HI>The greatest Difficulty</HI> is, how to describe a <HI>Scots Tory:</HI> Of old, when I knew them first, <HI>Tory</HI> was an Honest Hearted Comradish Fellow, who, provided he were Maintain'd and Protected in his Benefices, Titles and Dignities by the State, he was the less anxious who had the Government and Management of the Church: but now, what he is since <HI>Jure-Divinity</HI> came in Fashon; and that Christianity, and by Conse∣quence, Salvation, comes to depend upon Episcopal Ordination, I profess I know not what to make of him; only this I must say for him, That he endeavours to do, by Opposition, that, which his Brother in <HI>England</HI> endeavours, by a more Prudent and less Scrupulous Method.</P>
<P>Now, <HI>My Lord,</HI> from these Divisions there has got up a kind of <HI>Aristocracy,</HI> something like the Famous Triumvirate at <HI>Rome,</HI> they are a kind of Undertakers and Pragmatick Statesmen, who, finding their Fower and Strength great, and answerable to their Designs, will make Bargains with our Gracious Sovereign, they will serve Her faithfully, but upon their own Terms: they must have their own Instruments, their own Measures, this Man must be turned out, and that Man put in, and then they'll make Her the most <HI>Glorious Queen</HI> in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>Where will this end, <HI>My Lord?</HI> Is not Her Majesty in Danger by such a Method? Is not the Monarchy in Danger? Is not the Nation's Peace and Tranquillity in Danger? Will a Change of Parties make the Nation more Happy? No, <HI>My Lord,</HI> the Seed is sowen, that is like to afford us a perpetual Increase; it's not an Annual Herb, it takes deep Root, it Seeds and Breeds; and, if not timeously prevented by Her Majesty's Royal Endea∣vours, will split the whole Island in two.</P>
<P><HI>My Lord,</HI> I think, considering our present Circumstances at this time, the Almighty GOD has reserved this great Work for us: We may Bruise this <HI>Hydra</HI> of Division, and Crush this <HI>Cocka∣trice</HI>'s Egg; our Neighbours in <HI>England</HI> are not yet fitted for any such thing, they are not under the Afflicting Hand of Providence, as we are; their Circumstances are Great and Glorious, their Treaties are prudently managed both at Home and Abroad, their Generals Brave and Valorous, their Armies Successful and Victorious, their
<PB N="39" REF="326"/>
Trophies and Lawrels Memorable and Surprising; Their Enemies Subdued and Routed, their Strong Holds Besieged and Taken, Sieges Relieved, Marishals Killed and Taken Prisoners, Provinces and Kingdoms are the Results of their Victories; the Royal Navy is the Terror of <HI>Europe,</HI> their Trade and Commerce Extended through the Universe, Incircling the whole Habitable World, and Rendering their own Capital City the <HI>Emporium</HI> for the whole Inhabitants of the Earth; and which is yet more than all these things, the Subjects freely bestowing their Treasury upon their So∣vereign; and above all, these vast Riches, the Sinews of War, and without which all the Glorious Success had proven abortive; these Treasures are managed with such Faithfulness and Nicety, that they Answer seasonably all their Demands, tho at never so great a distance. Upon these Considerations, <HI>My Lord,</HI> how hard and difficult a thing will it prove, to perswade our Neighbours to a self-denyal Bill.</P>
<P>It's quite otherways with us, <HI>My Lord,</HI> we are an Obscure poor People, tho' formerly of better account; removed to a remote cor∣ner of the World, without Name and without Alliances, our Posts mean and precarious; so that I profess, I don't think any one Post of the Kingdom worth the Briguing after, save that of being Com∣missioner to a long Session of a Factious <HI>Scots</HI> Parliament, with an antedated Commission, and that yet renders the rest of the Ministers more Miserable: What hinders us then, <HI>My Lord,</HI> to lay aside our Divisions to unite Cordially and heartily together in our present Circumstances, when <HI>our All is at the Stake; Hannibal, My Lord,</HI> is at our Gates, <HI>Hannibal</HI> is come within our Gates, <HI>Hannibal</HI> is come the length of this Table, he is at the Foot of this Throne, he will demolish this Throne, if we take not Notice he'll seise upon these <HI>Regalia;</HI> he'll take them as our <HI>spolia opima,</HI> and whip us out of this House never to return again.</P>
<P>For the Love of GOD then, <HI>My Lord,</HI> for the Safety and Well∣fare of our Ancient Kingdom, whose sad Circumstances I hope we shall yet Convert unto Prosperity and Happiness! We want no Means, if we Unite, GOD blesseth the Peace-makers, we want nei∣ther Men nor Sufficiency of all manner of things necessary, to make a Nation happy: all depends upon Management, <HI>Concordia res parvae crescunt.</HI> I fear not these Articles, tho they were ten times worse than they are, if we once Cordially forgive one another, and that according to our Proverb, <HI>bygones be bygones and fair play to come.</HI>) For my part in the sight of GOD and in the presence of this Honourable House I heartily forgive every Man, and beggs that they may do the same to me, and I do most hum∣bly propose, that his Grace <HI>My Lord Commissioner</HI> may appoint an <HI>Agape,</HI> may order a Love-Feast for this Honourable House, that we may lay aside all self designs, and after our Fasts and Humilia∣tions may have a day of Rejoicing and Thankfulness, may eat our Meat with Gladness, and our Bread with a Merry Heart, then shall we <HI>sit each Man under his own Fig-tree,</HI> and <HI>the Voice of the Turtle</HI>
<PB N="40" REF="327"/>
<HI>shall be heard in our Land,</HI> a Bird famous for Constancy and Fide∣lity.</P>
<P><HI>My Lord,</HI> I shall make a Pause here and stop going on fur∣ther in my Discourse till I see further, if his Grace my Lord Com∣missioner receive any Humble Proposals for removing Misunder∣standings among us, and putting an end to our Fatal Divisions, upon Honour I have no other design, and I am Content to begg the favour upon my bended knees.</P></Q> No Answer.<Q><P><HI>My Lord Chancellor,</HI> I am sorry, that I must pursue the Threed of my Sad and Melancholy Story: what remains, I am afraid, prove as afflicting as what I have said; I shall therefore Consider the Motives, which have ingaged the two Nations to enter upon a Treaty of Union at this time: in general, <HI>My Lord,</HI> I think both of them had in their View to better themselves by the Treaty; but before I enter upon the Particular Motives of each Nation, I must inform this Honourable House, that since I can Remember, the two Nations have altered their Sentiments upon that Affair, even almost to Downright Contradiction, they have changed Headbands, as we say, for <HI>England</HI> till of late never thought it worth their pains of Treating with us; the good Bargain they made at the Beginning, they resolve to keep, and that which we call an Incorporating Union was not so much as in their thoughts. The first Notice they seem'd to take of us, was in our Affair of <HI>Caledonia,</HI> when they had most effectually broke off that design in a manner very well known to the World, and unnecessary to be repeated here, they kept themselves quiet during the time of our Complaints upon that Head. In which time our Sovereign, to satisfie the Nation and allay their Heats, did condescend to give us some good Laws, and amongst others that of Personal Liberties and of Peace and War; but <HI>England</HI> having declared their Succession and extended their Intail without ever taking Notice of us; our Gracious Sovereign QUEEN <HI>ANNE</HI> was Graciously pleased to give the Royal Assent to our <HI>Act of Security,</HI> and to give us a hedge to all our Sacred and Civil Interests, by Declaring it High Treason to endeavour the Al∣teration of them, as they were then Established. Thereupon did follow the Threatning and Minatory Laws against us by the Parli∣ament of <HI>England</HI> and the unjust and unequal Character of what Her Majesty had so Graciously Condescended to in our Favours: Now My <HI>Lord</HI> whether the desire they had to have us ingaged in the same Succession with them; Or whether that they found us like a free and independent People breathing after more Liberty than what formerly was lookt after; Or whether they were afraid of our <HI>Act of Security</HI> in case of Her Majesties Decease: which of all these Motives has induced them to a Treaty I leave it to themselves, this I must say only, they have made a good Bargain this time also.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="328"/>
For the particular Motives that induced us, I think, they are Obvious to be known; we found by sad Experience, that every Man hath advanced in Power and Riches, as they have done in Trade, and at the same time considering that no where through the World, Slaves are found to be Rich, though they should be adorned with Chains of Gold, we thereupon changed our Notion of an Incorporating Union to that of a Federal one; and being resolved to take this Opportunity to make Demands upon them, before we enter into the Succession, we were content to Impower Her Majesty to Authorise and Appoint Commissioners to Treat with the Commissioners of <HI>England,</HI> with as ample Powers as the Lords Commissioners from <HI>England</HI> had from their Constituents, that we might not appear to have less Confidence in Her Majesty, nor more narrow hearted in our Act than our Neighbours of <HI>Eng∣land:</HI> and thereupon last Parliament, after Her Majesty's Gracious Letter was Read, Desiring us to declare the Succession in the first place, and afterwards to appoint Commissioners to Treat; we found it necessary to renew our former <HI>Resolve,</HI> which I shall Read to this Honourable House. <Q><HI>Resolve presented by the Duke of</HI> Hamilton <HI>last Session of Parliament.</HI><P>That this Parliament will not proceed to the Nomination of a Successor, till we have had a previous Treaty with <HI>England,</HI> in Re∣lation to our Commerce and other Concerns with that Nation. And furder, it is <HI>Resolved,</HI> That this Parliament will proceed to make such Limitations and Conditions of Government, for the Rectifica∣tion of our Constitution, as may secure the Liberty, Religion and In∣dependency of this Kingdom, before they proceed to the said Nomi∣nation.</P></Q></P>
<P>Now, <HI>My Lord,</HI> the last Session of Parliament having, before they would enter upon any Treaty with <HI>England,</HI> by a Vote of the House, past both an Act for Limitations, and an Act for Rectification of our Constitution. What mortal Man has reason to doubt, the Design of this Treaty was only Federal?</P>
<P><HI>My Lord Chancellor,</HI> It remains now, that we consider the Be∣haviour of the Lords Commissioners at the opening of this Treaty. And before I enter upon that, allow me to make this Meditati∣on, that if our Posterity, after we are all dead and gone, shall find themselves under an ill made Bargain, and shall have a re∣course unto our Records, and see who have been the Managers of that Treaty, by which they have suffered so much; when they read the Names, they will certainly conclude and say, Ah! our Nation has been reduced to the last Extremity, at the time of this Treaty; all our great Chieftains, all our great Peers and conside∣rable Men; who used formerly to defend the Rights and Liber∣ties
<PB N="42" REF="329"/>
of the Nation, have been all Killed and Dead in the Bed of Honour, before ever the Nation was necessitate to Condescend to such Mean and Contemptible Terms; Where are the Names of the chief Men, of the Noble Families of <HI>Stewarts, Hamiltons, Grahams, Campbells, Gordons, Johnstons, Homes, Murrays, Kers,</HI> &amp;c. Where are the two great Officers of the Crown, the <HI>Constable</HI> and the <HI>Marischal</HI> of <HI>Scotland?</HI> They have certainly all been extinguished, and now we are Slaves for ever.</P>
<P>Whereas the <HI>English</HI> Records will make their Posterity, Reve∣rence the Memory of the Honourable Names who have brought under, their Fierce, Warlike and Troublesome Neighbours, who had Struggled so long for Independency, shed the best Blood of their Nation, and reduced a considerable Part of their Country to be∣come Waste and Desolate.</P>
<P>I am Informed, <HI>My Lord,</HI> That our Commissioners did indeed frankly tell the Lords Commissioners for <HI>England,</HI> That the In∣clination of the People of <HI>Scotland</HI> were much altered of late, in relation to an Incorporating Union, and that therefore since the Entail was to end with Her Majesty's Life, whom GOD long pre∣serve, it was proper to begin the Treaty upon the Foot of the Treaty the 1604 year of GOD, the time when we came first un∣der one Sovereign: but this the <HI>English</HI> Commissioners would not agree to, and our Commissioners, that they might not seem ob∣stinate, were willing to Treat and Conclude in the Terms laid be∣fore this Honourable House, and subjected to their Determinati∣on.</P>
<P>If the Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> had been as Civil and Complaisant, they should certainly have finished a Federal Treaty likeways, that both Nations might have the Choice, which of them to have gone into as they thought fit; but they would hear of nothing but of an intire and compleat Union, a Name which comprehends an Union, either by Incorporation, Surrender or Con∣quest, whereas our Commissioners thought of nothing but a fair equal Incorporating Union; whether this be so or no, I leave it to every Man's Judgment; but as for my self, I must beg liberty to think it no such thing. For I take an Incorporating Union to be, where there is a change both in the material and formal Points of Government, as if two Pieces of Mettal were melted down into one Mass, it can neither be said to retain its former Form or Sub∣stance, as it did before the mixture. But now when I consider this Treaty, as it hath been Explained and Spoke to before us these three Weeks by past, I see the <HI>English</HI> Constitution remaining firm, the same two Houses of Parliament, the same Taxes, the same Customs, the same Excises, the same Trade in Companies, the same Municipal Laws and Courts of Judicature, and all ours either sub∣ject to Regulations, or Annihilations: only we have the Honour to pay their old Debts, and to have some few Persons present for Witnesses to the Validity of the Deed, when they are pleased to contract more.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="330"/>
 Good GOD! What is this an intire Surrender?</P>
<P><HI>My Lord,</HI> I find my Heart so full of Grief and Indignation, That I must beg Pardon, not to finish the last part of my Discourse, that I may drop a Tear as the Prelude to so sad a Story.</P></Q> After having sit down, and some Discourses by other Mem∣bers interveening, he continued his Discourse thus,<Q><P><HI>My Lord Chancellor,</HI> What I am now to say, relates to the Me∣thod of Proceeding in this Weighty Affair: I hear it proposed by a Noble Member of the other side, that we should proceed in the same Order, as the Lords Commissioners Treaters did. In my humble Opinion, <HI>My Lord,</HI> It is neither the natural Method, nor can it be done without great Confusion and Repetition. To say, You'll agree to the Union of the two Kingdoms, before you agree in the Terms upon which they are to be United, seems like <HI>driving the Plough before the Oxen:</HI> The Articles, which narrate the Con∣ditions, seem to be the Premisses, upon which the Conclusion is inferred; and, according as they are found good or bad, the Success will follow. When a Man is Married to a Fortune in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> as they call it, I suppose he is satisfied with the thing be∣fore he determines himself to Marry; and the Proposal I have heard of agreeing to the first Article with a <HI>Proviso,</HI> That, if the rest of the Articles shall be found Satisfactory, and no otherwise, is of a Piece with the rest, and looks like Beating the Air, and no∣ways Consistent with fair and square Dealings. Besides, <HI>My Lord,</HI> if we were to go upon the first Article, are not all the rest of the Articles, besides many others not contained in the Ar∣ticles, valid Arguments either, <HI>Pro</HI> or <HI>Con,</HI> against Concluding, or not Concluding the first Article? And no Vote in this House, can hinder a Man, from making use of what Arguments he thinks fit. Moreover, the Searching the Records, and the Revising the <HI>Statute Books,</HI> Comparing <HI>the Books of Rates, Customs, Excise, Taxes,</HI> of both Nations, with one another, must all be previously consi∣dered, ere we determine our selves in one single Article; Add to this, That the Prohibitory Clause, with Relation to the Trade of both Nations, must be Adjusted, lest, like <HI>Esop</HI>'s Dog, we lose the Old, in Grasping at the New; the State of the <HI>English</HI> Compa∣nies must also be Exposed, how far we shall have Liberty into them, and what Advantage we may propose to our selves, by Trading to these Places, where they are secured, and above all, <HI>My Lord,</HI> the Security of our National Church, and of all that's dear unto us, must be previously Established to us, if practicable, before we Conclude the first Article. Therefore, <HI>My Lord,</HI> tho my particular Opinion be, tho we had a <HI>Cart Blanch</HI> from <HI>Eng∣land;</HI> yet the Delivery up of our Sovereignty, gives back with one Hand, what we receive with the other, and that there can be no Security, without the Guarrantee of a Distinct Independen∣cy betwixt the Parties Treating: Yet, <HI>My Lord,</HI> for further Sa∣tisfaction
<PB N="44" REF="331"/>
to this Honourable House, That every Member may fully satisfie himself, I humbly propose, That, passing by the first three Articles, which appear to be much of a Piece, we begin at the fourth Article of the Treaty, and if I be seconded in this, I desire it may be put to the Question.</P></Q></P>
<P>I shall make no Remarks upon this last and famous Speech, the Noble Person that spoke it, however he happened to mistake in some things, was a Person of extraordinary Parts and Capacity; And as he was very warm against the Uni∣on, it made that Opposition the more considerable.</P>
<P>This Speech, the Reader may see, was pointed directly against the Union, and in the first part of it argues against the Whole, in the last against the Parts—; but concludes to move against the immediate Proceedings.</P>
<P>The first Speech was from a Person no less capable in the Matter of the Treaty, and that had been a Commissioner in the Treaty at <HI>London;</HI> The Speeches are directly opposite, and are left thus upon Record to argue against one another.</P>
<P>The time had been taken up with their length, and the House, as well as the Nation, was, at this time, in an Un∣usual Ferment, so not many Replies were made. Mr. <HI>Seton,</HI> who made the first Speech, stood up to Answer the Lord <HI>Beilhaven,</HI> but, as he had already spoken, the Orders of the House, <HI>viz. That the same Member could not speak twice in the same Cause,</HI> were urged against his speaking, and the Earl of <HI>Ma—mont</HI> standing up to speak at the same time, the Lord Chancellor gave place to him; who indeed made a very short Return to so long a Speech, and which Answer occasioned some Laughter in the House: The Earl of <HI>Ma—monts</HI> Speech was to this Purpose, <HI>viz. He had heard a long Speech and a very terrible one, but he was of Opinion, it required a short Answer,</HI> which he gave in these Words, <HI>Behold he Dream'd, but, lo! when he awoke, he found it was a Dream;</HI> This Answer, some said, was as Satisfactory to the Members, who understood the Design of that Speech, as if it had been Answered Vision by Vision.</P>
<P>After these two Speeches, several Members spoke <HI>Pro</HI> and <HI>Con;</HI> But the Debate, in Close of the Day, turned so Warm, That, at the Desire of the House, it was Adjourned to the next <HI>Sederunt.</HI></P>

<P>Then the following Addresses were presented, <HI>viz.</HI> Address of Barons, Freeholders and others within the Shire of <HI>Stirling,</HI> Sub∣scribers of the same; Address of Barons, Freeholders and others within the Shire of <HI>Dumbartoun,</HI> Subscribers of the same; Address of the Magistrates, Town-Council, Deacons of Crafts and Burgesses within the Burgh of <HI>Linlithgow,</HI> Subscribers of the same; Address of Heretors and others, Inhabitants of the Town and Paroch of <HI>Dunkeld alias Caledonia,</HI> Subscribers of the same; and an Address of the Town and Paroch of <HI>Dysert,</HI> Subscribers of the same, all against an Incorporating Union with <HI>England,</HI> and were Read.</P>
<P>Thereafter the First Article of Union was again Read, as also the Motion mentioned in the last Minute relating thereto, <HI>viz.</HI> That it be agreed to, in the first place, to proceed to take the First Article of the Union to Consideration, with this Provision, That if the other Articles of Union be not Adjusted by the Parliament, then the Agreeing to and Approving of the First shall be of no Effect, and that immediately after the said First Article, The Parliament will proceed to an Act for Security of the Doctrine, Discipline, Worship and Government of the Church, as now by Law Establish∣ed within this Kingdom; And after some further Debate upon the said Article, a Resolve was offered in thir Terms, viz. <HI>Where∣as it evidently appears since the Printing, Publishing and Considering of the Articles of Treaty, now before this House; This Nation seems gene∣rally averse to this Incorporating Ʋnion in the Terms now before us, as Subversive of the Sovereignty, Fundamental Constitution and Claim of Right of this Kingdom, and as threatning Ruine to this Church as by Law Established.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And since it is plain, That if an Ʋnion were Agreed to in these Terms by this Parliament, and Accepted of by the Parliament of</HI> England, <HI>it would in no sort Answer the Peaceable and Friendly Ends proposed by an Ʋnion; But would on the contrair Create such Dismal Distrac∣tions and Animosities amongst our selves, and such Jealousies and Mi∣stakes betwixt us and our Neighbours, as would involve these Nations into Fatal Breaches and Confusions.</HI></P>
<P>Therefore, Resolved, <HI>That we are willing to enter into such an Ʋni∣on with our Neighbours of</HI> England, <HI>as shall Ʋnite us intirely, and af∣ter the most strict manner, in all their and our Interests of Succession, Wars, Alliances and Trade,</HI> Reserving <HI>to Ʋs the Sovereignty and In∣dependency of Our Crown and Monarchy, and Immunities of the King∣dom, and the Constitution and Frame of the Government both of Church and State, as they stand now Established by our Fundamental Constitu∣tion,</HI>
<PB N="46" REF="333"/>
<HI>by our Claim of Right, and by the Laws following thereupon; Or,</HI> Resolved, <HI>That we will proceed to settle the same Succession with</HI> Eng∣land, <HI>upon such Conditions and Regulations of Government within our selves, as shall effectually secure the Sovereignty and Independency of this Crown and Kingdom, and the Indissolvable Society of the same, with the Fundamental Rights and Constitutions of the Government both of Church and State, as the same stands Established by the</HI> Claim of Right, <HI>and other Laws and Statutes of this Kingdom.</HI></P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATION XV.</HEAD>
<P>It is very remarkable, That the Addresses now began to Throng upon the House, and we find them at the beginning of every Vote; The Debates of this Day visibly discovered the Reason and Design of procuring these Addresses, <HI>viz.</HI> That they might form an Argument from the general Aver∣sions of the Nation, and from thence, &amp; the bringing the Soul∣diers into the City, it was called a Cramming the Union down their Throats.</P>
<P>At the same time it was visible, there were such Methods made use of to procure Addresses, such want of Hands, such kinds of People who signed, such a Paucity of Gentry, where the Counties were full of Gentlemen, and such Varieties of Circumstances concurring, to make it appear, that it was the labour'd performance of a Party, that, <HI>it was thought,</HI> they met with the less regard.</P>
<P>There were indeed in several places Addresses prepared from the Gentry of the Country for the Encouragement of the Treaty, but it was concluded to be needless, since that would have been a kind of telling Noses without Doors, and the Party would have been pleased, to have had it past for a sort of Polling the Nation, in which, they having before dissatisfied and allarm'd the common People, they had the most Hopes of Success—; This therefore was laid aside, as a Step that would be of no use, and would put the Uni∣on upon a Tryal altogether inconsistent with the Constitution, and, as it were, debate it <HI>a-la-Mob.</HI></P>
<P>And therefore none of the Addresses on the other side were presented, tho I have the Originals of some by me, which were actually sign'd by the Country Gentlemen, and which were highly Expressive of their Assent to the Treaty, and of their Reasons for it, some of which were particularly the Danger of Popery, and of Introducing the old Tyranny in the Prince of <HI>Wales.</HI></P>

Nor can it but be reasonably supposed, That had the Noblemen and Gentlemen of <HI>Scotland,</HI> as well in the Parli∣ament as without, who were Hearty in the Business of the Union, gone Home, and raised their Tenants, Vassals, and Dependencies, to have appeared for the Union, either in the Addresses, or in the Field, they would, taking it at first, as much have Overpowered the other Party without Doors, as they Outvoted them within, since it was known, that except the Duke of <HI>At—le,</HI> the principal Number of the Opposers, were not Men of the greatest Interest in their Country, I mean as to the Command of their Vassals and Attendants.</P>
<P>But they never brought it to the Extremity of that Tryal, and therefore the Motions of the Party as to General Aver∣sions, being laid aside, they found themselves under a Necessity of Struggling in Parliament only.</P>
<P>The Endeavours of Mobbing the Parliament were supprest, and the Addresses obtained only a Reading, but had no direct Answer given them, other than the Proceedings of the House of Course, made out; the Thing now to be carried on within Doors was, to load the Treaty with Impracticable Amendments, while the Party without Doors endeavoured on the one Hand, to raise Tumults in the Country, bring up popular Addresses, and at last, down-right Rebellion, as in its place will appear: And on the other Hand, to Displease and Dissatisfie the Ministers, and bring them to appear publickly Uneasy; Of which we shall see further in its place.</P>
<P>The Debates of this day were very Warm, and several long Speeches were made, but it was impossible to obtain Abstracts of Speeches, which we could but just hear, and I shall not venture to Injure, either the Speaker or Hearer, by imposing my Language upon them, to Express what others said.</P>
<P>Long Debates were offered to the second part of the Vote above, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Union was Impracticable, that the Joyning of Nations could not be, would tend to Con∣fusion, and be necessarily broken, as in the Vote. This was raised upon the aforesaid Book of Mr. <HI>Hodges,</HI> and proved evi∣dently, that it was not his Hypothesis, but a Concert of Heads—, and his interfeiring Interests were here discours'd of.</P>
<P>I am not willing, to Examine into the Inconsistencies of some peoples Notions, started here in Matters of Interests, and how they raised Objections, which were not Grounded on Fact, Especially in Matters of Trade, I bury them in Silence, in respect to the Gentlemen; But it was next to Miraculous, to hear Men of sense alledge, That <HI>England</HI> got nothing by her <HI>West-India</HI> Trade, that most of her Forreign Trade was Engrossed by exclusive Companies, that <HI>Scotland</HI>
<PB N="49" REF="336"/>
got nothing by Trading with <HI>England,</HI> that <HI>Scotland</HI> could Gain by any Foreign Trade but <HI>England,</HI> and the like; these things will more evidently be detected hereafter.</P>
<P>In short, a Federal Union was offered, <HI>That was understood,</HI> any thing but the Right, any thing but the Treaty now begun, be∣anduse, could they have obtain'd a Vote against the present Teaty, the gaining Time for another Parliament had followed, and the Design of putting off, or delaying Time, had taken Effect.</P>
<P>Some Gentlemen, with extraordinary Reason and Force of Argument, endeavoured to Explain them the Absurdities and Inconsistencies of that Project, &amp; put the House in mind, that it was not a Federal Union, or a better Union that those Gentlemen desired, but really no Union at all; And that the Design was to Defeat the Endeavours of the Union only, in order to bring in <HI>French</HI> Bondage, and King <HI>James</HI> VIII upon them.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, the other Party soon saw in the House, it would go against them, &amp; therefore, before it was put to the Vote, the Duke of <HI>A—ole</HI> gave in his Protest, as in the Vote, toge∣ther with the whole Party of Opposets, on whatsoever prin∣ciple they Opposed; which Protest they had ready Concerted before, expecting, as was supposed, Things would go as they did, and that they should be Overpowered in the House.</P>
<P>I can not but Note here, that this great Debate, and on which the whole Weight of the Matter depended, happened on that Famous Day to <HI>Britain,</HI> I mean the very Day on which the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> afterward King <HI>William</HI> came to <HI>England,</HI> and was also the Birth-day of that Glorious Mo∣narch.</P>
<P>On the same day, now a second time, the Fate of <HI>Britain</HI> had a new Turn, and the success of that gave a pleasant presage to many observing People of the future happy Issue of the Thing now in hand.</P>
<P>The Gentlemen, who let slip no occasion to puzzle the Debates of this Matter, had now conceiv'd great hopes of a Broil among the Ministers, and were exceeding busie, to fill the Heads of some of the Gentlemen of the Clergy with Jea∣lousies and Dissatisfactions—, and yet I can not say, they brought in the Overture at this time, tho' they were always forward to push on that side too.</P>
<P>I can not say neither, that they met with no Encouragement here, or that there were no WarmHeads to be found in the Com∣mission, who apter to take Fire than was to be wished, were more easily gain'd, but if there were any such, the Prudence and Moderation of the rest of the Commission, so Over-ruled them, as kept them from any Precipitations, and Contributed greatly to the General Safety; Of which I have spoken more largely in its place.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATION XVII.</HEAD>
<P>I have already given an account of the Birth of this Paper called, <HI>The Representation and Petition,</HI> and the several Diffi∣culties it met with in the Commission of the Assembly, and which, some have said, was a Reason, why it met with less Encouragement in the Parliament, than was expected, but it may be worth Notice, that notwithstanding it did not meet with a very kind Reception, some of the Gentlemen having been disobliged in the Case of their Protest, yet the House did not wholly Omit the Things desired in it.</P>
<P>Some of the Gentlemen, who, as Ruling Elders, had pro∣tested in the Commission, had it seems met with some Per∣sonal Reflections from the Rashness of some Members; that was disobliging enough, and upon which they had withdrawn themselves from the Commission, and seldom, if at all, came there any more during the whole Sitting; And tho' the Rashness of the Persons who gave those Reflections, was not Approved by the Commission, yet it stuck a little too closs with some People, and it was thought, made them less careful of the Application made by the Ministers in this Case.</P>
<P>Upon the receiving the Representation or Petition into the House, there were no Debates of any Consequence, it was only Read, and the Act of Security being as <HI>per</HI> the Minutes Adjourned, the other lay by of Course.</P>
<P>The Money Bill now came on, and as the other Party thought the speeding of it might be a Step, to put an End to the Session, they all came into it, and gave it all the dispatch possible.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="340"/>
It was apparent, that in order to break up this Treaty, the Gentlemen studied all possible Methods to raise the Par∣liament—, this they could never have done while the Funds remained Unsettled, because it being a Thing of such Consequence to the Kingdom, the whole Countrey would have laid it at their Door, and the Queen would have had the highest Affront put upon both Her Person and Govern∣ment imaginable; And therefore this was one of the first Things they pusht at, and that made it pass immediately with no Opposition at all, those Gentlemen complying with it as it was removing an Obstruction to their General Design.</P>

<P>The Amendments here made to the Act for Security of the Church, make it evident, that the Parliament did not slight∣ly pass over that Affair, as some people pretended they would do, tho' they did not enter into the Debate of the Insufficien∣cy which some offered, as Things which tended not to Amend∣ments of the Act as it was offered, but to a Rupture of the Debate; for the People who offered at the Insufficiency of the Act, went upon this Foot; Not that this Overture or Act was an Insufficient Security, but that really the Union with <HI>England</HI> as an Episcopal Nation, was Inconsistent with the Safety of the Church of <HI>Scotland;</HI> and that not this Act only was, but any other Act that could be made, would be Insufficient to secure the Church of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>This appeared to be the plain Design, in that as I have already noted, the Gentlemen that spoke Loudest for the Insufficiency of the Act of Security, were not of those People, who really were most concerned for the Safety of the Church of <HI>Scotland;</HI> the Objections also were not Calculated for Amendments or Additions, but for De∣stroying the Bill it self, as Built on the supposition of a Union, which, they said, Was a Foundation that would not bear such a Superstructure—. And tho' some well meaning Men too were of Opinion, that the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> could not really be safe in a Union within <HI>England;</HI> yet these Gentlemen, as is noted, applyed it purely as an Obstacle to the Union, and as a Thing by which means, they hoped, to render the Union Universally Odious and Terrible to the People.</P>
<P>And this will be more apparent from the Protest entered into, after all the Clauses were Read, and after all Amend∣ments, that could be reasonably desired, were agreed to, as will appear in the next days Minute.</P>

<DIV2 N="19" TYPE="observation">
<HEAD>OBSERVATION XIX.</HEAD>
<P>The reading of the Act of Security having been begun last day, several Amendments were offered, such as first the Enu∣merating the Acts of Parliament upon which it was grounded; This admitted no long Debates, if it had had any Significa∣tion, it would have been granted, but it was generally esteemed a thing of no value, meerly unnecessary and trifling, and as such was rejected: The Reason given was, because one Act is particularly specified to be ratified by this Treaty, <HI>to wit,</HI> The 4<HI>th Act</HI> of the 1<HI>st Parliament</HI> of King <HI>William</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> Intituled, <HI>An Act Ratifying the Confession of Faith, and Settling Presbyterian Church Government,</HI> and then it mentions, <HI>With the hail other Acts relating thereunto,</HI> which was thought sufficient and full enough.</P>
<P>The next Amendment was for the Colleges, which was found reasonable, and was hinted by some, who had, not without just Cause observed, how much the Schools of the Dissenters in <HI>England</HI> are regretted by some People, who en∣vy the Encrease of their Number; And this therefore, as a most reasonable Demand, was immediately agreed to by the the Parliament, and is made part of the Act, as will appear by the Draught of the Bill.</P>
<P>The Fourth Clause had an Objection of greater Moment depending on it, which caused long Debates, and was built on a Foundation, however plausible and just in it self, had yet such a known Impossibility before it, <HI>morally speaking,</HI> as that no small Hopes were conceived from it, that it would shock the whole Treaty.</P>
<P>All Men know, That, in <HI>England,</HI> by the <HI>TEST ACT, as it is called,</HI> all Persons that obtain any Office, Civil or Mili∣tary, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are obliged to take the Sacrament, according to the Usage of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and to bring Certifi∣cates, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of the same, under pain of Incapacity, among
<PB N="57" REF="344"/>
other Penalties: Now it was a most plausible Argument, That, if the Subjects of both Kingdoms were to enjoy equal Privileges, the Subjects of <HI>Scotland</HI> taking the Sacrament in the National Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> ought to be as capable of Places or Offices, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as the Subjects of <HI>England</HI> taking the Sacrament in the National Church of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Nor was this Matter carried a little Way, but became the Subject of infinite Discontents without Doors, and of long Disputes within—; It was suggested <HI>and printed too, by the same Author, of whom mention is already made, as Writing against the Ʋnion,</HI> That all the Members of Parliament in <HI>England</HI> were obliged to take the Sacrament before they could sit in the House, but this, <HI>as false in Fact,</HI> was crush'd at first, several Accounts being given of its being quite otherways—; But then this Clause coming in upon the Neck of that Surmise, it was thought a Popular Argument, and indeed was so: And the People began to be very uneasy about it, said the Parliament would give up all to the <HI>English;</HI> That this was so fair a Thing, it could not be argued against, and in∣deed a great many People looked upon the Thing, <HI>viz. taking of the English TEST,</HI> as what they wished earnestly enough to have done; but the more penetrating Judg∣ments saw further into the Depth of this, and finding it a De∣sign purely strikeing at the Root of the Union, they were the rather inclined to drop it, tho' they at the same time desired it—, the Difficulty lying in this, That the Sacramental Test being a thing the <HI>English</HI> Parliament have been very Tenacious of, upon all Occasions, this would be to ask something which they knew would not be granted, and consequently put the Treaty to a Stop.</P>
<P>Others again proposed a Reciprocal Test to be placed in <HI>Scotland,</HI> to secure <HI>or exclude all such of the</HI> English <HI>Nation, as would not acknowlege this Church, &amp;c.</HI> The Tenor of this was according to the following Copy, which they called a <HI>Formula.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I</HI> A. B. <HI>do Swear and Declare, That the Presbyterian Go∣vernment of this Church is a lawful Government, and that I shall neither, directly nor indirectly, do any thing to the Alteration thereof.</HI></P>
<P>But this also dropped of it self, for some People that were nevertheless against the Union; yet were against this sort of Reciprocal Oath, as a thing they did not approve on any Ac∣count one or other.</P>
<P>there were some small Amendments to the Fifth and Sixth Clause, but not of Consequence, and thus this difficult Mat∣ter was past into a Law.</P>
<P>There were some who clamour'd very much on this Head, and a great many personal Reflections were made, I will not say, altogether without Cause, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Church was aban∣doned by her own Friends, <HI>or at least by those who pretended to be so;</HI> That, if they had asked more, it might have been
<PB N="58" REF="345"/>
obtained; and that the Demands the Ministers made, were not duly weighed, <HI>much less answered;</HI> but yet it seems, on the whole, that the main Foundation Article, <HI>viz.</HI> The E∣stablishment of the Church Government unalterable, was effec∣tually secured; and tho' some particulars might be omitted, the Church has no open place left, at which her Enemies can wound her Constitution.</P>
<P>There were great Clamours raised, both within and without the House, about the Insufficiency of this Act of Se∣curity, as that it was <HI>lessening the Security the Church already had by the Claim of Right,</HI> and not providing an Equivalent Security in the Room of it; That the very Treating of it, im∣plyed a further Security was needful, and yet no further Secu∣rity was provided, than alone confirming the Claim of Right.</P>
<P>This was the Foundation of the Proposal of the Reciprocal Test, or an Oath to secure the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> in like manner, as the Test Act is for the Security of the Church of <HI>England.</HI> Of which above.</P>
<P>Another Objection was, That tho' indeed the Act of <HI>Wil∣liam</HI> and <HI>Mary</HI> was confirmed, yet, that the Act declaring it to be High Treason to Impugn the Claim of Right was not confirmed, nor the other Acts relating thereto specified—; Nor some Ancient obsolete Acts taken away, which stand unrepealed, and which are inconsistent with Presbyterian Government.</P>
<P>This was Answered, particularly as to Enumerating the Acts <HI>as above</HI> and as to Repealing the Acts, the Twenty Fifth Ar∣ticle of the Union declares all Acts contraveening this Trea∣ty to be so far, as they do so contraveen this Treaty, <HI>ipso facto</HI> Repealed, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Again it was objected, That here was no Provision made for Prevention of Mischief to the Church, for want of a Com∣mission or Court for Plantation of Kirks, and Valuation of Teinds, which is what the Church will be in great want of.</P>
<P>This was effectually Answered, by settling an Act of Par∣liament, previous to the Union, for the Plantation of Kirks and Valuation of Teinds, <HI>Impowering the Lords of Council and Session to Judge, Cognosce and Determine in all Affairs and Causes whatsoever, which, by the Laws and Acts of Parliament of this Kingdom, were formerly referred to, and did pertain and belong to the Jurisdiction and Cognizance of the Commissioners formerly appointed for that Effect, as fully and freely in all respects, as the said Lords do or may in other Civil Causes.</HI></P>
<P>The great and main Objections were against the Possibility of either Church or State being secured so by this Treaty, as that a <HI>British</HI> Parliament might not overwhelm it again by Plurality of Voices, which is a supposed Consent.</P>
<P>This, as the same, with the general Objection against the Union, was answered in the general Terms of the Union,

<HI>viz.</HI> That this was to remain Unalterable for ever, and there∣fore could not be supposed to be Temporary.</P>
<P>Upon the Debate of these Things its plain, what I have so often alledged on these Gentlemen, and which therefore is not putting it as my Opinion, which I am not at all forward to offer to the World; but it appears, That the Objection of the Gentlemen did not so much ly against particular Clau∣ses, tho' they thought fit to dispute their Ground by Inches there too, but this Objection lay against the general Head, <HI>The Ʋnion,</HI> and they brought every Head, as they went thro' them, to shock directly with the whole Treaty.</P>
<P>Thus in the Protest given in here by the Lords Dissenting, it is expresly said, That the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> can have no real and solid Security by any manner of Union, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>—as <HI>per</HI> the Minute.</P>
<P>Also it is to be noted here, That the Gentlemen <HI>of that side</HI> were the first who Moved to Print the Names of all those that Voted to the first Article, <HI>Pro</HI> and <HI>Con,</HI> which was thought at that time a day, an Exposing the Persons to the popular Resentment, the Tumults of the People beginning to be at that time very high.</P>
<P>But the other Party, who had agreed voluntarily to the, said Printing of Names, took the Advantage now, and Mov'd, That the same might be done also, in the Vote about the Church, by which the Episcopal Party were brought in, protesting in behalf of the Church: The Gentlemen would have avoid∣ed it, but having been the first in putting the like upon the other, they could not shun it: This Exposed them very much, and opened the Eyes of many of the People, when they saw such People Voting for the Church, who never own'd the Church in their Lives; and others Voting against the Thing, who were constant Members of the Church, and had given constant proof of their Zeal for the Churches advantage.</P>
<P>And thus the Act of Security was past, and after Engrossed into the Body of the Articles, as will appear by the Act of Parliament.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATION XXI.</HEAD>
<P>The Debates of this Day made yet a larger Discovery of the Affair, and the Gentlemen who were against the Union, struggling on all Occasions against the going on of the Ar∣ticles, took now a new measure.</P>
<P>The Marquess of <HI>An—dale</HI> made this Motion for the Suc∣cession, as appeared by the Lord <HI>Beilhavens</HI> Speech; There had been a Party of Gentlemen, as was before observed, who were always for the Succession with Limitations, but were opposed by others who were intirely against' the Succes∣sion at all, as it respected the House of <HI>Hannover:</HI> But as several People differing in their other Sentiments, yet joyned in their opposing the Union, so here the strongest Opposers of the Succession came now into the Thing they had so long opposed, and moved now for the Succession with Limitations, in order to avoid the Union.</P>
<P>My Lord <HI>Beilhaven</HI> seconded this with another Speech, which was afterward printed, in which his Lordship moved for settling the Succession upon the Princess <HI>Sophia</HI> of <HI>Hannover &amp;c.</HI> I have printed this Speech the rather, because it is really the Substance or Recital of three Speeches, as will be seen in the particulars of it, and shews plainer than I can otherways ex∣press, how that part was acted.<Q><P><HI>My Lord Chancellor.</HI></P>
<P>Your Lordship may remember the last day, when we had under Consideration, whether to proceed to the <HI>Fourth</HI> or <HI>Second Article,</HI> That I did Witness my Con∣cern and Resentment, to find so many Honourable and Worthy Members of this House, so forward to finish the Demands of <HI>England,</HI> in this Treaty; without tak∣ing Notice of any one Article, that could be properly said to relate to the Demands of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>Now, that we are entered upon the <HI>Second Article,</HI> I desire to be resolved in one <HI>QƲESTION, What are the Motives, that should engage us to take</HI> England<HI>'s Succes∣sor upon their own Terms?</HI> Is it not strange, that no
<PB N="64" REF="351"/>
<HI>ANSWER</HI> should be given to this Question, save that, <HI>When you come to consider the rest of the Articles, you shall be satisfied on that Demand?</HI> This is a new way of Ar∣guing, <HI>My Lord,</HI> a Method without Precedent, ranver∣sing Nature; and looks more like Design than Fair-Dealing. I profess, I think the Huge and Prodigious Rains, that we have had of late, have either drowned out, or found out another Channel for <HI>Reasoning,</HI> than what was formerly; for by what I can see by this <HI>New Method,</HI> the Agreeing to the <HI>First</HI> Article, shall be found a sufficient Reason, why we should agree to the <HI>Second,</HI> and the Agreeing to the <HI>Second</HI> for the <HI>Third,</HI> and so for all.</P>
<P>If there was ever such a Farce acted; if ever Reason was <HI>Hudibras'd,</HI> this is the time: Consult all the Treaties since the beginning of the World to this day, and if you can find any one Precedent, I shall yield the Cause.</P>
<P>I shall Instance, <HI>My Lord,</HI> one for all, and that is, The first and worst Treaty that ever was set on Foot for Mankind; and yet, I am sorry to say it, there appears more Ingenuity in it, than in our Procedure: When the <HI>Serpent</HI> did Deceive our Mother <HI>Eve,</HI> he proposed three Advantages, before he presum'd to Advise her to to <HI>Eat the Forbidden Fruit:</HI> The <HI>First</HI> was taken from the <HI>Sight,</HI> the <HI>Second</HI> from the <HI>Taste,</HI> and the <HI>Third</HI> from the <HI>Advantage</HI> following thereupon. That from the <HI>Sight,</HI> was inforced by a <HI>Behold, how lovely and comely a thing it is, it's pleasant to the Eye.</HI> That from the <HI>Taste,</HI> from a Perswasion, that it was Good for Nourishment, <HI>it's good for Food.</HI> That from the <HI>Advantage,</HI> it will <HI>make you wise, ye shall be as the Gods;</HI> therefore, upon all these Considerations, <HI>Eat.</HI></P>
<P>Allow me, <HI>My Lord,</HI> to run the Parallel of this, with Relation to our Procedure in this <HI>Treaty.</HI></P>
<P>Upon the first Account that our Nation had, of the Treaty's being finished betwixt the two Nations, People appeared all generally very well satisfied, as a thing that would tend to the Removal of all Jealousies, and the settling a good Understanding betwixt the two Kingdoms. But, so soon as the <HI>Articles of the Treaty</HI> ap∣peared in Print, the very Sight of them made such a Change, as is almost inconceivable; they were so far from being pleasant to the Eye, <HI>My Lord,</HI> that the Na∣tion appears to abhor them.</P>
<P>One would think, <HI>My Lord,</HI> That it had been the Interest of those, who are satisfied with the Thing, to have gone immediately into the Merits of these particu∣lar Articles which relate to <HI>Scotland,</HI> and to have said, <HI>Gentlemen, be not affrighted with their ugly Shape, they are better than they are bonny; Come, Taste, come make a</HI>
<PB N="65" REF="352"/>
<HI>narrow Search and Inquiry, they are good for</HI> Scotland, <HI>the wholesomest Food that a Decaying Nation can take: You shall find the Advantages, you shall find a Change of Condition, you shall become Rich immediately; you shall be like the</HI> English, <HI>the most Flourishing and Richest People of the Ʋniverse.</HI></P>
<P>But our Procedure, <HI>My Lord,</HI> hath been very far from the Prudence of the <HI>Serpent;</HI> for all our Arguments have run upon this blunt Topick, <HI>Eat, swallow down this Incorporating Ʋnion, tho it please neither Eye nor Taste, it must go over: You must believe your Physicians, and we shall consider the Reasons for it afterwards.</HI></P>
<P>I wish, <HI>My Lord,</HI> That our Loss be not in some small manner Proportionable to that of our first Parents, they thought to have been Incorporate with the Gods: But in place of that, they were justly Expelled Paradise, Lost their Sovereignty over the Creatures, and were forced to Earn their Bread with the Sweat of their Brows.</P>
<P><HI>My Lord Chancellor,</HI> I have heard a Proposal, made from the other Side by the Marquis of <HI>Annandale;</HI> That, in place of Agreeing to this <HI>Second Article,</HI> where∣in the Succession is to be Declared, as a Consequence of our being United to <HI>England</HI> in one Kingdom, we should immediately go to Intail our Crown upon the Illustrious Family of <HI>Hannover,</HI> upon such Conditions and Limitations as are in our own Power to make, for the Security of our Sacred and Civil Concerns. I think, This is the Import of what his Lordship gave in, by a Resolve formerly, and hath told this Honourable House, That he thinks, he acts Consequentially to his Former declared Principles, and that this is now the on∣ly Measure, which can settle and secure the Peace and Quiet of this Nation, and fix a firm Security for the Pro∣testant Interest, and a perfect Understanding betwixt the two Nations.</P>
<P>I have also heard a Discourse, by his Grace the Duke of <HI>Hamilton,</HI> shewing, That ever since his Grace had the Honour to be a Member of this Honourable House; he had made it his Business to serve the Sovereign and his Nation faithfully and honestly, without any By-Ends, By-Views, or Self-Interests; That before the Affair of the Succession was Tabled in <HI>Scotland,</HI> he had endeavoured to promote the Interest of his Nation, by Good Laws, and by the best Counsels he was capable to give, for rectifying Things amiss, and advancing the solid Interest of his Country; That since the Affair of the Succession came to be Considered, he could never give himself the Liberty to believe, but that previous to any Settlement, we ought to have had such Conde∣scensions
<PB N="66" REF="353"/>
with Relation to Trade and Commerce from <HI>England,</HI> as might Retrieve the Losses the, Nation hath sustained from them, ever since the Union of the Two Crowns under one Sovereign; and that thereupon, to prevent all Faction and Party in the Treating of an Affair of such Importance, he had freely left the Nomination of the Lords Commissioners to Her Majesty, and wishes the Choice had been Answerable to his Design: But none can accuse him as Bargaining for himself, since he has no Reason to Complain of the Breach of any Sti∣pulation upon that Head; That now having Consider∣ed the Articles of this Treaty lying before us, and the Fatal Consequences that may follow upon the Finishing of an Incorporating Union with <HI>England,</HI> with the ge∣neral <HI>Aversation</HI> that <HI>appears by the Addresses from the several Shires of the Kingdom,</HI> and particularly from <HI>the Address of the Commission of the General Assembly, and of the Royal Burrows of</HI> Scotland; he finds it necessary to al∣ter his Thoughts of that Matter, That he was none of these who loved to keep Things Loose and in Confusion; He had an Estate in both Kingdoms, and therefore it was not to be supposed, he would make use only of a Treaty, to throw out the Succession one time; and of the Succes∣sion, to throw off the Treaty another time. Therefore to prevent worse Consequences, he is content, That in this Parliament, the Succession be Declared and Settled upon the Illustrious Princess <HI>Sophia</HI> Electoress of <HI>Hannover,</HI> and the Heirs of Her Body, upon such Conditions and Limi∣tations as shall be found necessary by this Parliament, to secure our Civil Rights and Liberties, the Independency and Sovereignty of the Nation, &amp; the Presbyterian Govern∣ment of this Church, as it is Founded upon the <HI>Claim of Right,</HI> and Established by Law, and whose Privileges and Settlement he Resolves to Support with the Outmost of his Power.</P>
<P>And therefore, his Grace thinks himself Obliged with all Humility in this present Juncture of Affairs, to Address himself particularly to His Grace My Lord Com∣missioner, and to beg of his Grace, That he would be pleased to acquaint Her Majesty with the True State of the Nation, and with the Proposal made for Allaying the present Ferment and Settling a Solid Peace and Good Un∣derstanding betwixt Her Two Kingdoms, and that a small Recess may be granted in the mean time, till Her Maje∣sty's Gracious Answer come, which, with all Submission, he conceives, will prevent these Bad Consequences, that the further Pushing on of this Treaty may occasion. I think, <HI>My Lord,</HI> this is materially what his Grace said, tho' not so fully nor so well expressed.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="354"/>
Now, <HI>My Lord,</HI> it remains, that I give Account of my self and of my own Opinion of this Affair: All who know me, <HI>My Lord,</HI> know that I have been from the beginning on a Revolution foot; I ventured my Life and Fortune with the First, and I have ever since acted Consequentially to my Principle. It's true I was never a good Courtier under any Reign; because I had a Rule for my Obedience, and never made Obedience my Rule; my Reputation was never stained, Nor had I ever any Reproach laid upon me, save when I was brought in, Head over Ears, in a <HI>SCOTS</HI> PLOT, <HI>A Plot, very well known, design'd to blast the Reputation of a Set of People, the best affected to the Sovereign, and to the true Interest of their Nation, that ever</HI> Scotland <HI>bred.</HI> What my Opinion was with Relation to the Succession is very well known also, I lookt upon Limitations with another Eye, than some others were pleased to do, I was far from Treat∣ing them in Ridicule; Because as all Human Affairs, they are lyable to Alterations, and might be taken off: that Argument proves too much, and Con∣sequently proves nothing at all. Should a Man refuse to have a good Estate settled upon him, because he may squander it away, and become Bankrupt? Must a Good Law be refused, because it may afterwards be Re∣pealed? No, <HI>My Lord.</HI> Where the Power is lodged in our selves, we have all Human Security Imaginable for the Thing; It is not so, where the Power is lodged in others: therefore I shall alwise Choose that Security, which depends upon my self, preferable to any other.</P>
<P>This, <HI>My Lord,</HI> hath Confirmed me, That Limitati∣ons of our own making is the best Security; tho I alwise thought them not the Full, of what we merited, for the going into the <HI>English</HI> Succession. For Considering the Injuries, that we have received from them, we ought to have Reparation upon this Emergent: and I think with∣out Incorporating with them, they might have given us some small Incouragement in our Trade with them, which would have been profitable unto us, and no man∣ner of way prejudicial unto them, as I can clearly Demon∣strate, if there be Occasion for it: But since this is not the proper Place nor Season for such Proposals, I shall go in with the Proposal made by the Marquis of <HI>Annan∣dale,</HI> and fortified by his Grace the Duke of <HI>Hamilton:</HI> because I think, it is the best that we can make of it at this time, the fittest Measure to prevent Civil Wars, allay the Ferment of the Nation, and far preferable to <HI>this In∣corporating Ʋnion,</HI> which <HI>as to us in all it's Clauses</HI> ap∣pears to be <HI>most Ʋnreasonable.</HI></P></Q></P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="355"/>
This was a Politick Speech, there appeared some ill Nature in it, &amp; a great deal of Satyre upon the Union, but that was the Temper of the Times, and must be past over on that account; nor shall I say any thing to it here, the Noble Person that made it, acquiesced in the Union freely enough when it was made; as shall appear in its place.</P>
<P>But I can not pass it over without observing, That—this Speech gives Light into several Things; <HI>First,</HI> It gives a hint at the Suggestion that had been made of D— <HI>H—s</HI> aiming at his own Title in all his former Oppositi∣on made against the Succession, as well formerly as now, and clears that Noble Person from all supposition of such a thing, by his having offered now to come into the Succession.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> It gives a true sight of the genuine Reason of all this sudden Complyance with the Succession, a Thing which had something very surprizing in it, and which, some thought, must have presently carried abundance of People from the other Party, the Design being, as was afterward publickly own'd, <HI>if possible, to Evade the passing this Article, as a Branch of the Ʋnion.</HI> The Case was, They were content with the Succession, as an Act of the Parliament of <HI>Scotland,</HI> settled and Established in the Form, necessary in that Case; but they would not have the Succession brought upon them as the Consequence of the Union.</P>
<P>And at last, they had this at the Bottom of it all, That if the Succession had been taken, <HI>as it was now offered,</HI> it must have been taken in stead of the Union, and that had answe∣red the present Occasion, <HI>viz. Diverting the Grand Affair</HI> of the Union.</P>
<P>But they met with a double Disappointment in this, <HI>First,</HI> As to offering the Succession in stead of the Union, they came too late, since the Party who were for the Succession formerly with Limitations, were now come into the Union, as the best Scheme of Limitations they could ever hope to attain, and would not go back, finding the Union a better Scheme of Limitation than their own, because it Entitled them to all the Limitations already settled in <HI>England,</HI> which they could not but allow, were more and better than any they had proposed in <HI>Scotland,</HI> or than indeed they could expect to obtain.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> They were disappointed in <HI>the way,</HI> for the <HI>Jacobites who held with them before</HI> in Opposing the Union, <HI>broke with them here,</HI> since they found themselves abandon'd by them in the main Article for which they opposed the Uni∣on, <HI>viz.</HI> The Transposing the Crown, as they called it, from the Son of the late King <HI>James;</HI> and if they were obliged to quite the Article of the Succession, the rest was indifferent to them.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="356"/>
And therefore you find the Protest at the End of the Vote of this Day, was directly against the Union, tho' it was put <HI>in the usual Form,</HI> of the former Article of Limitations; so these things did but increase the Division, and weaken the Party that Op∣posed the Union, and by that means gave the more Room for those who were for the Union, to carry it; And <HI>thus the Second Article past,</HI> which concluded the Settlement of the Protestant Succession. And it was to be observed, that the settling this Article was very satisfactory to abundance of People, who were otherwise not very well reconciled to the Treaty, and gave a Handle to the Friends of the Union, to bring some People to a clearer sight of their Interest, since they might see the Union was the readiest way, <HI>and perhaps the only way,</HI> to obtain the Protestant Succession, and to se∣cure it upon the firmest Foundation, and on the best Limi∣tations, a Thing which had been long wish'd, and very much struggled for before.</P>

<P>Whereupon it was moved that the agreeing to the third Article of the Treaty, in relation to the Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> shall not be binding or have any effect, unless Terms and Conditions of an Union of the two Kingdoms, and particularly the Constitution of the said Parliament be finally adjusted and concluded, and an Act pass thereupon in this present Parliament, and that the saids Terms and Conditions be also agreed to, and Ratified by an Act of the Parliament of <HI>England,</HI> the Constitution of the said Parliament of
<PB N="70" REF="357"/>
<HI>Great-Britain</HI> being left intire, until the Parliament come upon the twenty second Article.</P>
<P>Moved also to proceed to the consideration of the fourth and other Articles of Union before the third.</P>
<P>And after some Reasoning thereupon, it was put to the Vote, proceed to the Consideration of the third Article in the Terms of the above Motion relating thereto, or proceed to the fourth Ar∣ticle; and it carried, proceed to the third.</P>
<P>And accordingly the Parliament proceeded to the consideration of the third Article; And after long Debate thereupon, a Vote was stated, Approve of the third Article in the Terms of the above Motion relating thereto, <HI>yea</HI> or <HI>not.</HI></P>
<P>But before Voting, the Marquess of <HI>Annandale</HI> gave in a Protest, upon the Foot of his former Resolve presented to this House, and contained in the Minute of the 4th of <HI>November</HI> instant, and craved that the Narrative thereof might be prefixed thereto, and which Narrative and Protest, is as follows, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q REND="inline">"Whereas it evidently appears, since the Printing, Publishing and Considering of the Ar∣ticles of Treaty now before this House. This Nation, seems Ge∣nerally averse to this Incorporating Union, in the Terms now be∣fore us, as subversive of the Sovereignty, Fundamental Constituti∣on and Claim of Right of this Kingdom, and as threatning Ruine to this Church as by Law Established.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And since it is plain, that if an Union were agreed to in those Terms by this Parliament, and accepted of by the Parliament of <HI>England,</HI> it would in no sort answer the peaceable and friendly ends proposed by an Union; But would on the contrair create such dismal Distractions and Animosities amongst our selves, and such Jealousies and Mistakes betwixt us and our Neighbours, as would involve these Nations into fatal Breaches and Confusions.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Therefore I do protest for my self, and in Name of all those who shall adhere to this my Protestation, That an Incorporating Union of the Crown and Kingdom of <HI>Scotland,</HI> with the Crown and Kingdom of <HI>England,</HI> and that both Nations shall be Repre∣sented by one and the same Parliament, as contained in the Articles of the Treaty of Union, is contrair to the Honour, Interest, Fun∣damental Laws and Constitutions of this Kingdom, is a giving up of the Sovereignty, the Birth-Right of the Peers, the Rights and Privileges of the Barons and Burrows, as is contrair to the <HI>Claim of Right,</HI> Property and Liberty of the Subjects, and third Act of Her Majesties Parliament 1703, by which it is declared high Treason in any of the Subjects of this Kingdom, to Quarrel, or endeavour by Writting, Malicious and advised Speaking, or other open Act or Deed, to alter or innovate the <HI>Claim of Right,</HI> or any Article thereof: As also, That the Subjects of this Kingdom, by surren∣dering their Parliaments and Sovereignty, are deprived of all Se∣curity, both with respect to such Rights, as are by the intended Treaty stipulated and agreed, and with respect to such other Rights, both Ecclesiastick and Civil, as are by the same Treaty pretended
<PB N="71" REF="358"/>
to be reserved to them. And therefore I do protest, that this shall not prejudge the Beeing of future <HI>Scots</HI> Parliaments and Conventi∣ons within the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland</HI> at no time coming.</Q></P>
<P>After Reading whereof, he took Instruments thereupon, and it was agreed, That, at calling the Rolls, the Adherers to the above Protest should be so marked; And also, That the hail Members be marked as they shall Vote, <HI>Approve</HI> or <HI>Not,</HI> and that a List of their Names, as they shall Vote <HI>Pro</HI> or <HI>Con,</HI> shall be printed. And the Lord Chancellor was allowed to have his Name Printed and Record∣ed as an Approver.</P>
<P>Then the Vote was put, Approve of the Third Article in the Terms of the Motion relating thereto, or not, and it carried Ap∣prove.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATION XXII.</HEAD>
<P>The Parliament were all this while Debating the Gene∣rals of the Treaty, and therefore the Debates were also in general: The Work of this Day was not at all debating what Number of Members should be the Proportion of the Parliament, or how, or in what manner they should be cho∣sen, and the like; but whether <HI>Britain,</HI> as now to be Unit∣ed, should be Represented by one and the same Parliament, yea or no.</P>
<P>The Debates were very long upon this Head; And as, in other Cases, it had, for some Days, taken up part of their Time, in Reading the long Addresses of Shires, Burghs and
<PB N="72" REF="359"/>
Parishes against the Union; so, on this Day, there were some very particular ones reserved, and which seemed to be calculated for the Day, in which, according to the Popular Arguments of the Time, the Union was called a Surrendering the Sovereignty of <HI>Scotland</HI> to the <HI>English.</HI></P>
<P>I could never indeed see any Schemes offered, or learn that there was any such Proposal, in what manner those that were for reserving the Parliament of <HI>Scotland,</HI> would have formed two separate Parliaments in an United Kingdom; so that the Debates of this Day were not of what should be, but of what should not be; and the Uniting the Parliament was objected against, but without offering an Alternative of what they would have in the Room of it.</P>
<P>The principal Arguments made use of in this Days Debate were,<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That Uniting the Parliament, was actually giving up the Constitution of <HI>Scotland.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM> 2. That it was subjecting <HI>Scotland</HI> to <HI>England.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>3. That it was dangerous to the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> whose Government was to be subjected to a Parliament of Episcopal Members.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. That it was contrary to the National Oath or Cove∣nant.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>It is not my Design to make Arguments of my own, in order to answer them, or to make this History a Dispute, instead of a Relation of Fact—: But there having been such loud Clamours against the Union in general, and such violent Struggles against it in Parliament, it may not be in∣consistent with an History, to relate the Foundation on either side which they acted upon, and as much of the Argument on both sides, either <HI>within</HI> the House or <HI>without,</HI> as is useful to let the Reader into a true Understanding of the Transacti∣ons of this Critical Time; and for this Reason I have divid∣ed this Part into the Minutes and Observations, the one is perfectly Historical, the other Explanatory of the Particulars, and I hope I need make no more Apology for the Method.<LIST>
<ITEM>1<HI>st,</HI> It was alledged, That this Conjunction of Par∣liaments was a giving up the Constitution; Or, as it was frequently Worded in their printed Addresses, sur∣rendering the Sovereignty and Independency of <HI>Scot∣land.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>It was answered, This was from a Defect in the com∣mon Acceptation of the Word <HI>ƲNION,</HI> as it was now Treating of, and of its full Extent—of the Unions being <HI>CENTERAL</HI> and <HI>ƲNIVERSAL;</HI> in which it was alledged, That the Union now Treating of was, in the utmost possible Meaning of the Word, comprehen∣sive of every Good to both; exclusive of all manner of Preference or Disparity of Parts, abhorring all things In∣jurious
<PB N="73" REF="360"/>
or Diminishing to either; a full Coalition, a general Incorporation of Nations, of Interests, of Power, and of Safety:—A Sameness of Circumstan∣ces and of Sympathies; becoming one and the same Body, with one and the same Head, Life, Soul, Nutri∣ment, Point and Period; an Union of the very SOUL OF THE NATION, all its Constitution, Customs, Trade and Manners, must be blended together, digest∣ed and concocted, for the mutual United, Undistinguish'd Good, Growth and Health of the one whole United Body; and that all the Suggestions of subjecting or surrendering one part to another, were owing to the want of a right Conception, both of the Terms and of the Thing designed by the Term <HI>ƲNION.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>It was urged further, That this extended Signification of the Union excluded all possibility of a Separation of Interests, or Clashing of Properties, and that mutual Protection, mutual Increase, mutual Improvements were the Consequences to be expected, not from this or that Circumstance, Policy or Management, but from the Nature of the Thing.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>One may be sure these things were warmly argued within Doors, when without, the People were in the utmost Fermen∣tation, and the whole Nation seemed as in an Agony, the Enemies of the Union went about Bemoaning <HI>Scotland,</HI> and Sighing, as they called it, for the Dying Constitution, and a Noble Lord within, standing up to make a Speech on this Occasion, but being stop'd by the Order of the Day, said Mournfully, It was hard he could not be allowed to speak one Word for their Dying Country—; These and the like Speeches had put the People in the last Degree of Concern.</P>
<P>The Capital Arguments made use of on this Occasion, and made Popular against the Uniting the Parliaments, were such as these,<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That whatever Agreement is now concluded between the two Kingdoms, will never be binding to the New Parliament.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That the two Kingdoms effectually subject them∣selves to the New Parliament, all the Conditions stipu∣lated on either side to the contrary in any wise notwith∣standing.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>To this it was Answered, That the <HI>British</HI> Parliament were absolutely bound up by the Stipulations of this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reaty; that they being a subsequent Power to the two respective Parlia∣ments of either Kingdom, had no other or further Power to act, than was Limited them by the Stipulations of both King∣doms; That all subsequent Power is inferior in its Extent to the Power which it derives from; That the Parliament of <HI>Britain</HI> being the Creature of the Union, formed by ex∣press
<PB N="74" REF="361"/>
Stipulations between the two separate Parliaments of <HI>En∣gland</HI> &amp; <HI>Scotland</HI> cannot but be unalterably bound by the Con∣ditions so stipulated, and upon which it received its Beeing, Name and Authority: The Foundation of a <HI>British</HI> Parlia∣ment, is this Treaty; to say, They will <HI>not</HI> be bound by it, is to say, they will pull themselves up by the Roots: they dye when the Union receives any mortal Wound; they cannot infringe one Article of the Union; they cannot put a Question in the House upon any one Article.</P>
<P>As to the Objection, That there was a Surrender of So∣vereignty and Constitution, and delivering <HI>Scotland</HI> bound Hand and Foot into the absolute Dispose of the <HI>English.</HI></P>
<P>This was Answered by way of Question and Answer, a∣mong other Things, thus,</P>
<P>Q. <HI>What is it constitutes the Parliament of</HI> Britain?</P>
<P>A. <HI>The Ʋnion.</HI> Let any Man give another Answer to it, if he can.</P>
<P>Q. <HI>How is it constituted?</HI></P>
<P>A. <HI>By Treaty</HI> between two Nations by their Heads and Representatives, <HI>viz.</HI> the Queen and Parliament of each Kingdom.</P>
<P>Q. <HI>How do they bring it to pass?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> By mutual altering their respective Constitutions, and forming one general Constitution upon a Treaty of Equalities and Equivalents; the Stipulations of which Trea∣ty are agreed to by the Constituent Parts of the subsequent Body.</P>
<P>Q. <HI>Ʋpon what Right doth the present respective Parliaments depend?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The Natural Right of the Free-holders of both King∣doms, which entitles them by the Possession of their Lands, to have the free Exercise and Power of making the Laws by which they are to be governed.</P>
<P>Q. <HI>Does this new Constitution destroy that Right?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Not at all, but reserving that Right, which indeed it cannot destroy, agrees to limit the Exercise of it by such and such Forms, and on such and such Conditions, which Conditions are the Limitations of the Power of the new Par∣liament, as being the Act and Deed of the old Parliaments, whose Constitution was founded on Original Right.</P>
<P>The next Popular Argument, &amp; which took up much of the Debates of this Day, was, That <HI>the Parliament had not a Power to it into this Ʋnion;</HI> Or, as it was Worded in the publick Ad∣dresses, <HI>That 'tis not in the Power of the</HI> Scots <HI>Government to con∣clude such an Ʋnion, without a manifest Violation of Trust, and with∣out doing a manifest Act of Injustice, Oppression and Ʋsurpation a∣gainst the Fundamental Rights and Liberties of this Free Kingdom;</HI> and this was the Substance of most of the Addresses present∣ed to the Parliament.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="362"/>
This was Answered by Enquiring into the Right Parlia∣ments had to Lessen, Enlarge, or Limit the Representative; of which when the Number of Members comes to be Treated of.</P>
<P>The last Argument, and which indeed was made more use of without Doors than within, was the Danger to the Church Government of <HI>Scotland,</HI> by the Uniting the Representative; in which it was argued,<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That the <HI>British</HI> Parliament being chiefly Com∣posed of Persons of another Communion, might, when ever they pleased, by a Majority of Votes overpowering the <HI>Scots,</HI> Overthrow their Church, introduce Episco∣pacy, and reduce the Presbyterians to a Toleration, or perhaps worse.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That there being twenty six <HI>English</HI> Bishops sitting in the House of Peers, and who were by this Treaty to continue sitting there; this was subjecting <HI>Scotland</HI> in all its future Laws, to the suffrage of Bishops, and by consenting to the Treaty in which they were Established, it was Recognizing and Establishing Episcopacy, which was to involve the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland</HI> in National Perjury, they being obliged by the National Covenant, never to subject themselves to Episcopacy, but to their power to Reform the Churches of both Kingdoms.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>These Suggestions indeed had but too much Success Abroad, and were the principal Subject of the several Ad∣dresses, some of which the Reader may see in the Appendix, as a Sample of the rest.</P>
<P>The Arguments had their particular Answers, too long to insert here, and are Touch'd in another part of this Work, the general Answer is contained in the former Paragraphs, <HI>viz.</HI> the Obligation of the future Parliament to the exact Observation of the Treaty, in which the Security of the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> was particularly provided for, and left Unalterable for ever—. A Security so firm as the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> never enjoyed before from any Civil Government, or Humane Au∣thority in the World.</P>
<P>As to the Objection about the Covenant, it was indeed mentioned in most of the Addresses, but it was never menti∣oned in Parliament at all; or at least, not so as to come to any Debate, or to put any Question upon it; and therefore I refer it to its proper place.</P>
<P>There were several long Speeches made on this Article, some to shew, that it was not in their power to Vote upon it at all, without Consulting Constituents, that the Parliament was a Fundamental of Government, and could not be so much as altered, much less given up—, and that this Treaty was an entire Surrender of the Constitution. It would take up too much Room in this Work, to repeat all the Argu∣ments brought on this Head, or to insert the Speeches that were
<PB N="76" REF="363"/>
made much more to Collect the Arguments brought by way of Answer—; But as the following Speech was made on this day, and seems to be a full Answer to the Main of these Ob∣jections, I could not omit it, as it was spoken by a Gentle∣man eminently concerned, both in the present Debate, and in the Treaty at <HI>London.</HI></P>
<Q><TEXT LANG="eng">
<BODY>
<DIV1 TYPE="speech">
<HEAD>A Speech in Parliament spoken by Mr. <HI>Seton</HI> junior of <HI>Pitmedden</HI> <DATE><HI>November</HI> 18 1706,</DATE> upon the Subject of the third Article then being in Debate in the House.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lord Chancellor,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Having heard with much Attention the third Ar∣ticle Debated; I find it lyable with the other Articles of this Treaty, to be put in a false or true Light by the Speakers to it, in proportion to those Notions they have of the Nature of this Union: What I am to say con∣cerning it, shall be to remove some Objections, which in my Opinion is the proper Method to smooth the way for approving it.</P>
<P>The principal Objections are; That the Representa∣tives for Shires and Burghs, cannot legally approve this Article, without the Assent of their Constituents; and that by the Approbation of it, the Sovereignty and In∣dependency of this Kingdom, will be surrendered to <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P><HI>My Lord,</HI> To give a distinct and convincing Answer to the first Objection, let us look a little to the Nature of our Constitution of Government.</P>
<P>Our Government is not a <HI>Polish</HI> Aristocracy, founded on <HI>Pacta Conventa,</HI> whereby all the Gentry are Im∣powered in their particular Meetings, to prescribe Rules to their Representatives in a General Dyet.</P>
<P>Our Government is not a common Democracy, where∣by every Subject of <HI>Scotland</HI> may claim a Vote in the <HI>Legislature.</HI></P>
<P>Our Government is and has been many Ages past, a Limited Monarchy, wherein the Sovereign and Re∣presentative are the only Judges of every thing which does contribute to the Happiness of the Body Politick, and from whom no Appeal can legally be made; and this Description is agreeable to Reason, to our Law, and to our History.</P>
<P>Reason teaches us, that <HI>Anarchy</HI> is destructive to Mankind, and that no Society of People can be well
<PB N="77" REF="364"/>
Governed without a Supreme Power, whose proceedings are only alterable by it self; <HI>Grotius</HI> says (L. 1. <HI>C.</HI> 3. §. 7.) That we call the Supreme Power, whose Acts are not subject to the Power of another.</P>
<P>Our Law is positive, that this Supreme Court is subject to no Humane Authority, <HI>Act</HI> 130. <HI>P.</HI> 8. <HI>J.</HI> 6. &amp; we learn from our History, that the greatest Alrerations have been made in the Constitution of our Government, without Consulting the People: out of which I humbly offer a few Examples: In the Reign of <HI>Kenneth</HI> the 3d the Monarchy that Originally was Elective, became Heredi∣tary: In the Reign of <HI>James</HI> 6th the Representation of the Clergy in Parliament was restored: In the Reign of <HI>Charles</HI> the 2d the Prerogative was exalted above its natural Level; and in the year 1698, the King was Dethroned, and the Clergy Expelled this House.</P>
<P><HI>My Lord,</HI> I have heard asserted, that there are Fundamen∣tals of Government which cannot be altered by this House, without the Consent of every <HI>Scotsman:</HI> But where were these stipulated? Where are they Recorded? Were these made by our Forefathers at the first Institution of their Government, and have all succeeding Parliaments Sworn to their Observance? These Questions, Methinks, deserve our Consideration, before it be asserted what is an unalterable Fundamental by this House.</P>
<P>As to the Arguments of Sir <HI>George Mackenzie,</HI> and other eminent Lawyers, brought upon the Stage to sup∣port this Notion of Fundamentals; I think they require no particular Answer, because any Member who under∣stands the Nature of Government may see clearly, that these Arguments are founded on Roman Laws Cal∣culated for People, as Members of private Societies, and not for perpetual Rules to the Supreme Power of any Nation.</P>
<P>In fine, I believe there are no Fundamentals of Go∣vernment in any Nation, which are not alterable by its Supreme Power, when the Circumstances of Times re∣quire; and whoever is acquainted with History may learn, that there are no People at present in <HI>Europe,</HI> which in different Ages have not suffered variety of Changes in Government. I do indeed acknowledge, there are Fundamentals in Nature, to wit, Liberty and Property, which this House can never destroy, without exceeding its outmost Bounds of Power, that are always limited to the Publick Good; Nevertheless this Honourable House is only capable to Judge of the most proper Means of securing these Fundamentals: And for my part I sin∣cerely believe that no judicious Man will say, There is the least danger of our Liberty and Property by an Uni∣on
<PB N="78" REF="365"/>
of Parliaments, when he Reflects that the People of <HI>England,</HI> have been in all Ages Noble Asserters of the Rights of the Subject; have spent much Blood and Trea∣sure in Defence of the Liberties of their Neighbours, and that after this Union, Encroachments on the Rights of the Subjects of any part of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> must endanger the Liberty of the whole.</P>
<P><HI>My Lord,</HI> I come now to the next Objection, That by the Approbation of this Article, we Surrender the So∣vereignty and Independency of this Kingdom.</P>
<P>These words I acknowledge are very long, and may sound Harmoniously in the Ears of the Populace: for my part, I would be sorry just now to have occasion to say, that in Fact, our Supremacy and Independency were Sur∣rendered the day King <HI>James</HI> got possession of the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> Throne, if at the same time I could not affirm, that these are again restored to us by this Treaty, which was managed with a Decorum &amp; Equality, that became two In∣dependent and distinct Nations; and not after such a Clan∣destine manner as was used by Queen <HI>Mary</HI> &amp; the <HI>French,</HI> the 4th of <HI>April</HI> 1554, on which day our Sovereignty was indeed surrendered, as may be seen in the <HI>Recueil de Traitez,</HI> &amp;c. P. 510.</P>
<P>But to put this Question above Controversie, I con∣ceive two ways only whereby a Free Nation loses its Sovereignty and Independency, which are Conquest, and a voluntar Surrender of its Rights to another Nation, without any Reservation.</P>
<P>I am sure no person in right Judgment will alledge, That this intended Union is a Conquest; Nor can it be called a Surrender, seeing the Treaty contains certain and distinct Reservations to both Kingdoms: Nor can I comprehend how either of two Nations, by an entire Union, surrenders its Privileges: on the contrair, I agree with the learned <HI>Grotius</HI> (<HI>L.</HI> 2. <HI>C.</HI> 9. §. 9—.) who's Opinion is, That the Rights and Privileges of two distinct Nations United, are consolidated into one, by a mutual Communication of them.</P>
<P>Another Objection, <HI>My Lord,</HI> has been moved against this Article, which belongs more properly to the 22d Article, and that's concerning the Number of the Repre∣sentatives from <HI>Scotland,</HI> to a Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain.</HI> This Objection I'll endeavour to Answer in as few words as the Nature of it will allow.</P>
<P>If both Nations are to be represented by one Parlia∣ment, there must be Members from both Nations, and their Numbers must be adjusted by some Rule, which can be no other than that Fundamental in the Union of all Societies, whereby Suffrages are computed, to wit, the
<PB N="79" REF="366"/>
Proportion each Society contributes for the support of the whole: Now, the Union of <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>England</HI> is but the Union of two great Societies of People, into one Body Politick; So that we have nothing to direct our Forming a true Notion about the Number of the Representative agreed to by this Treaty, on the part of <HI>Scotland,</HI> but the Proportion we are able to contribute for the support of the Go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>nment of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and that has respect to the Numbers of our People, to the Extent of our Taxes, or to an Arithmetical proportion betwixt these, and those of <HI>England;</HI> All which being duly considered, I may be bold to Affirm, that the Representative agreed to by the Commissioners for <HI>Scotland,</HI> is more than falls to our Share.</P>
<P>Several Authors, who have wrote about the Nature of Society, or the Union of two or more Societies, a∣gree to this Fundamental; and <HI>Grotius</HI> (<HI>L.</HI> 2. <HI>C.</HI> 5. § 22.) has two Examples out of <HI>Strabo</HI> relating to it; One is, When <HI>Lybica</HI> United with Three Neighbouring Cities, It was stipulated, That each of the Three was to have one Voice, but <HI>Lybica</HI> Two, because it contri∣buted much more to the common Benefite, than any of the rest: The other Example is, That there were 23 Cities in <HI>Licia</HI> United, whereof some had three Voices, some two, and some but one.</P>
<P><HI>My Lord,</HI> By the Representative of Sixteen for the Nobility, there's no greater Hardship put upon them, than was put upon the small Barons in the Reign of King <HI>James</HI> the First, who then were of the same State with the Nobility, and submitted to the Law for Conveni∣ency.</P>
<P>By the Representative of Fourty Five for the Commons, no prejudice is done to the State of Barons in respect of Representation; for if they be Represented from every Shire, or at least from the most considerable Shires, 'tis of no Import, whether every Shire be Represented by one or more: And as to the State of Burrows, I'll pre∣sume to say, That the Retrenchment of their Repre∣sentation is a Piece of Justice done to this Nation, if Property or Taxes be the Rule of Representation.</P>
<P><HI>My Lord,</HI> So far have I endeavoured to Answer the material Objections against this Article, not out of any Prospect to convince the Members against this Union, as to fortifie the Judgments of those for it; And I wish heartily, That the Constituents for Shires and Burghs may have a true Confidence in their Representatives, while they are Accomplishing this Great and Noble Work of an Union of both Kingdoms, especially consi∣dering, That they are bound by Oath to give their best
<PB N="80" REF="367"/>
Advices and Suffrages; That they were chosen by themselves in a free Election; That they have their Families and Estates among 'em; That the same Li∣berty, Property and Religion are common to 'em both; And that the Good or Bad Consequences of this Uni∣on, must equally affect Representatives and Constitu∣ents.</P>

</TEXT></Q>
<P><HI>THIS SPEECH</HI> was received with great Satisfaction and Applause, and the Arguments in it were so clear, especially as to the Proportions of the Representative, that it was very useful, when that Head came to be debated; and I cannot but think the Reader will think his Time well bestowed in Reading it, in that he will see by it, whether the Union was carryed by Strength of Reasoning, or, as some alledged, cram'd down their Throats by meer Number of Voices.</P>
<P>The Debates held very long, but at length the Question being proposed, the Vote was carried with the usual <HI>Provi∣so, viz. That it be of no Force if all be not Concluded;</HI> and the dissenting Members protested, as you will see in the Minutes. And so this mighty Case was also Determined.</P>

<P>The Lord Chancellor acquainted the Parliament, that last Night his Grace Her Majesties High Commissioner, in his Return to the Palace, was Insulted by a Number of People of the meanest Degree with Stones, which was an high Affront both to Her Majesties High Commissioner, and to the Parliament; And therefore moved, that the Parliament may give the necessary Orders, not only to find out such as have been guilty as Actors or Abettors therein, but to pre∣vent the like in time coming; and after some Reasoning on the said Representation and Motion:</P>
<P>It was agreed, to Remit to the Committee Nominate for Examin∣ing the Calculation of the Equivalent, to enquire into the Matter of this Insult; And to endeavour to find out the Actors and Abettors, if any be, with Power to the said Committee to promise Indemnities and Rewards for Discoveries, and to Seize and Imprison any Person whom they shall have ground to suspect to be guilty, as Actors or Abet∣tors, &amp; to call for the Magistrates &amp; Neighbours of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> for In∣formation, and to Report to the Parliament, what Information and Discovery they shall make of the said Insult, or of any former. As

also, to Report their Opinion, what Measures may be proper for preventing the like in time coming, and the Committee appointed to meet the first Interval Day of Parliament at nine of the Clock.</P>
<P>The Parliament did likeways Recommend to the Lord High Con∣stable to prosecute forthwith these Persons, who were Imprisoned on Account of a former Tumult, and ordained the Magistrates of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> to furnish what Probation they can, to the Fiscal of the Constables Court, against such as were so Imprisoned.</P>
<P>Address of the Baillies, Counsellours and Citizens of St. <HI>Andrews,</HI> Subscribers of the same, against an Union with <HI>England,</HI> in the Terms of the Articles, given in and Read.</P>
<P>Thereafter it was moved. That the Parliament proceed to the Fourth Article of Union.</P>
<P>Moved also, That, before proceeding to the Consideration of the Fourth Article, a Clause be added to the Third Article in thir Terms, <HI>And that the said Parliament of</HI> Great-Britain <HI>shall meet and sit once in Three Years at least, in that Part of</HI> Great-Britain <HI>now called</HI> Scotland.</P>
<P>And after some Debate thereupon, the Consideration of the said Additional Clause delayed, till the Parliament come to the Twenty Second Article.</P>
<P>Then the Fourth Article of Union was Read, and after some Discourse thereupon, the further Consideration thereof was delayed till the next <HI>Sederunt</HI> of Parliament, and the Consideration thereof to be then resumed previous to all other Business.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATION XXIII.</HEAD>
<P>The Affairs of Tumult and Clamour from the Street, I have related in its proper place; yet, as far as it came to be con∣sidered in Parliament, I must take notice of it here, but shall be the briefer, referring to what is said elsewhere.</P>
<P>The first Rabble had been crush'd for some time, <HI>as has been observed already,</HI> and the Vigilance of the Government had secured the Parliament hitherto; But the Inveterate Fu∣ry of the poor ignorant People, imposed upon by the Popu∣lar Arguments of the Times, and these enlarged upon by the various Pamphlets and Speeches against the Union, which were spread amongst them, was very hard to be restrained.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Queensberry,</HI> the Queens High Commissioner, received divers Affronts in his going to and from the Parlia∣ment, tho' his Grace did not think worth his while to trouble the Parliament with it, while it was any thing tolerable; But it was now grown to that Height, That not only the Commissioners Life was in Danger, but the Publick Peace seemed manifestly aimed at, and it was very necessary to put a Check to such Insults, lest the whole might be endangered.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="369"/>
The High Commissioner had received several private Intimations of Designs to assasinate him, and several Letters, some abusive and threatning, others pretending to give him Caution to preserve his Person, others directly pretending to inform of the Designs, the Time when, Manner how, and Weapons by which he was to be Murdered; whether these were real Designs, or only Attempts to amuse, and perhaps discourage his Grace in the Discharge of his Duty in so weighty a Work, was, I believe, never certainly known: But whoever will calmly consider the Temper of the People at that time, how inflamed by the Artifice of a Party, and how frequently they shew'd their Readiness to have undertaken any Thing, tho' never so desperate, to have broken off this Affair, will wonder, That no Agent of Satan was found hardned enough to have committed that, or any like sort of Villany.</P>
<P>Nor did it seem that there was any thing wanting, but the meer Courage to venture their Lives in such a Bloody Action, since, in the Occasion which was now brought be∣fore the House, it appeared there were Stones thrown at the Commissioners Coach from the Tops of Houses, sufficient to have Murdered him, if Providence had not more especially protected both his Person, and the Affair in Hand; which, had any such Villany been perpetrated, would, most certainly, have all been lost in the necessary Confusions that must have followed.</P>
<P>For the Readers particular Information of the Temper and Humour of the People at that time, some of the Threatning Letters sent to his Grace the High Commissioner, are Printed in the Appendix N. <HI>G xx.</HI> faithfully Transcribed from the Original.</P>
<P>As to the manner of the present Insult offered the Com∣missioner—, it was thus, Opportunity was taken, upon the length of the Debates that Day, which keeping the House late—, and the Lord Commissioner being to pass the Streets in the Night, the whole length of the City from the Parliament House to the Palace, the Mob took the opportunity of the Darkness, a Time proper for such Villanies; First they affronted the Guards, and followed them with Curses and Opprobri∣ous Words, and their Numbers increasing as they went on, they began to throw Stones at them, which occasioned some little Disorder among the Horses, and this at last encreased to the throwing Stones at the Commissioner himself, one of which narrowly miss'd his Person.</P>
<P>The Coachman and Postilion, whether <HI>frighted themselves,</HI> or that the Horses were unruly, drove a little faster than usual down the Street, which put the Guards to a full Trot; and that heartening the Rabble, as if the Guards had fled from them, they Shouted and continued pursuing them with
<PB N="83" REF="370"/>
Dirt, Stones, and such sort of Violence, till they came to the Palace, where the Foot Guards received them, and kept off the Croud.</P>
<P>Every Body will allow, that considers these Circumstances, which I was an Eye Witness to, That it was time to put a Stop to this Violence, and to restrain a Head-strong Multi∣tude thus made Bold and Furious, lest they should, <HI>as in such Cases is not uncommon,</HI> run on to more violent Extremes; and therefore the Lord Commissioner ordered the Lord Chan∣cellor to Represent it to the House, as in the Vote.</P>
<P>The Motion for the Parliament sitting once in Three Years was needless, for that indeed it was settled in the Twenty Second Article for the First Parliament, and established in <HI>England</HI> by other Laws made there, which were to continue in Force by the Treaty.</P>

<P>Whereupon it was moved to take the several Branches of Trade, to be communicate, into Consideration, that it may thereby appear how far the Communication of Trade shall be advantageous; And after Reasoning thereupon.</P>
<P>The Vote was stated, Approve of the Fourth Article, Reserving the Consideration of the several Branches of Trade, till the Parlia∣ment come to the subsequent Articles, <HI>yea</HI> or <HI>not.</HI></P>

<P>Which being Read, it was moved, that six Months more time be added to the time allowed by the Proposal, for purchasing Ships or Vessels: And after some Reasoning thereupon, the further con∣sideration thereof was delayed till next Sederunt of Parliament, to be then Resumed, previous to all other Business.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATION XXIV.</HEAD>
<P>This Article being General, but containing several Parti∣culars, it was judged proper to pass it in the gross first, with a Reserve for such Clauses and Branches of Trade, as should come into Consideration afterward; for otherwise these Branches of Trade would have been foreclosed, by agreeing to this Article in the full Extent of the Words.</P>
<P>These Branches came all to be Considered in the Debating other Articles, as particularly, when they came to Examine the Affairs of Drawbacks, Bounties on Exportation, Prohibi∣tions, and Restrictions in Trade, the several Customs, Duties, Equalities and Proportions of Trade; Of which in their Course.</P>
<P>This Reserve, however, made the Article it self pass the more readily at this Time, for it was the first Article after Voting the Generals, that was Branched out into Particulars, and therefore the Adjourning these Particulars was the more acceptable.</P>
<P>The Debate of the Fifth Article lay only here, the Treaters had Debated about the Time limited for allowing the Ships then in the Hands of the <HI>Scots,</HI> to be free Ships, the <HI>Scots</HI> Commissioners would have had it been the Time of Ratify∣ing the Union; The <HI>English</HI> Commissioners insisted on it, that it should be the Time of Signing the Treaty; and the Reasons were good, that otherwise People might buy multitudes of Foreign Ships, and have time to furnish themselves, and pass these Foreign Built Ships as free Bottoms, in the Terms of the Act of Navigation, to the infinite Damage of the whole Island; And this had the more Force with it, in that it could not but be allowed, that it was the great Advantage of this whole Island, to encourage the Building, and consequently the Employing our own Ships—. However, many popular Arguments were used to lengthen out the Time, such as, That <HI>Scotland</HI> was not yet in a Condition to Build, and that this would check her Trade, to leave her naked of Ships till she could furnish her self with Materials for Building; that for
<PB N="85" REF="372"/>
the Fishing and East-Country Trade, it was absolutely neces∣sary to furnish Foreign Built Ships, till <HI>Scotland</HI> could Build for her self.</P>
<P>It was alledged, <HI>England</HI> could furnish Ships, and it was so material a Thing to Encourage the Building, and Increase of our own Shipping, that <HI>England</HI> would insist upon it, and had reason so to do.</P>
<P>However, after long Debating, it was agreed, to lengthen the Term to the Ratifying the Treaty; and this was the first Alteration made in the Articles—; But it was referred to the next day.</P>

<P>Thereafter the Fifth Article of Union again Read, with the Pro∣posal for Amending, Explaining and Inlarging the same, insert in the former Days Minutes, and altered thus, <HI>viz. That all Ships or Vessels belonging to Her Majesties Subjects of</HI> Scotland <HI>at the time of Ratifying the Treaty of Ʋnion of the two Kingdoms, in the Parliament of</HI> Scotland, <HI>tho Foreign Built, be deemed and pass as Ships of the Build of</HI> Great Britain, <HI>the Owners, or where there are more Owners, one or more of the Owners within twelve Months after the first day of</HI> May <HI>next, making Oath that at the time of Ratifying the Treaty of Ʋnion in the Parliament of</HI> Scotland, <HI>the same did in hail or in part belong to him or them, or to some other Subject or Subjects of</HI> Scotland, <HI>to be par∣ticularly Named, with the place of their respective Abodes, and that the same doth then, at the time of the said Deposition, wholly belong to him</HI>
<PB N="86" REF="373"/>
<HI>or them, and that no Foreigner directly or indirectly hath any share, part or interest therein.</HI></P>
<P>And after some Reasoning thereon, there was a second Proposal given in for the amending the Article in these Terms, <HI>That all Ships and Vessels belonging to Her Majesties Subjects of</HI> Scotland <HI>at the time of Ratifying the Treaty of Ʋnion of the two Kingdoms, in the Parlia∣ments of both Kingdoms.</HI></P>
<P>And after some Debate the Vote was stated, Approve of the first Paragraph of the Fifth Article, with the first Amendment or second; And it carried Approve with the first Amendment.</P>
<P>Thereafter the rest of the said Fifth Article of Union was Read, and a Proposal given in for adding a Clause in these Terms, <Q REND="inline">"That for the space of seven years from and after the Concluding the Treaty of Union in both Kingdoms; It is expresly agreed, that none of the Seamen or Mariners Aboard any of the Ships belong∣ing to the Subjects of that part of United <HI>Britain,</HI> now called <HI>Scotland,</HI> shall either at Home or Abroad be pressed from aboard their said Ships, to serve in any of Her Majesties Ships of War or Friggots; And in case after the said seven years, it shall happen that there be a Levy of Seamen in United <HI>Britain,</HI> for serving in the <HI>British</HI> Fleet, That the said part of United <HI>Britain,</HI> now cal∣led <HI>Scotland</HI> shall only be burdened with such a proportion as our Taxes bear, in proportion to that part of United <HI>Britain,</HI> now called <HI>England,</HI> but prejudice to the Officers of Her Majesties Ships or Fleet to engage as many Voluntar Seamen in their service as they can agree with, in this part of United <HI>Britain,</HI> and this Ar∣ticle to be unalterable by any subsequent <HI>British</HI> Parliament.</Q></P>
<P>Which being Read, after some reasoning thereupon, it was put to the Vote, Add the second Clause or not, and it carried not.</P>

<P>The Debate about the admitting the <HI>Scots</HI> Ships as free Bottoms, was now reassumed, and the Time limited for the Properties to be made out, was altered from the Time of Signing the Articles, to the Time of Ratifying the Treaty.</P>
<P>The present Dispute was, Whether it should be the Time of Ratifying the Treaty in <HI>Scotland,</HI> or the Ratification in both Kingdoms—, this Article was Disputed by Inches, and some thought, there was more Nicety used here, than was of any Signification; and that therefore it seem'd the effect of a Ge∣neral Struggle against the Union, where every thing was laid hold on, that either might bring on some Alteration they thought <HI>England</HI> could not comply with, or that at least might but cause a Dispute in <HI>England,</HI> or that might so gain
<PB N="87" REF="374"/>
time, as to avoid having the thing Compleated in the then sitting Parliament.</P>
<P>It was well known, the <HI>English</HI> would be very tender of their Act of Navigation, which is the Security of their Trade, and the main Encourager of their Shipping, and the longer this Liberty of purchasing Ships from the <HI>Dutch</HI> was extend∣ed, the more Room there would be for Exceptions in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> their Trade being the more exposed to the bringing in Foreign Bottoms among them.</P>
<P>And if it be true, as I have seen a Minute made of it in Writing—, That the Party had prepared Schemes of Ob∣jections to be offered in the Parliament of <HI>England,</HI> against the very Alterations which they themselves had procured to be made in <HI>Scotland;</HI> If this be true, it will abundantly justifie the general Supposition I have so often hinted at, <HI>viz.</HI> That these Objections were rather calculated to delay the Treaty, and overthrow the Union it self, than from any particular Regard had to the Reason and Nature of the Thing objected.</P>
<P>Nothing else could be the Occasion of such strong Struggles for things in themselves not of any great Advantage to <HI>Scot∣land,</HI> as in this Case of the Ships, of which, it may be noted, That, after that Matter was settled, it was hardly known, that one Ship was bought, either in <HI>Scotland</HI> or <HI>England,</HI> with the Design of making it Free, as was suggested.</P>
<P>However, after long Debate, the middle Course was taken, and the Time was extended from the Time of Signing the Articles, as it was Agreed in <HI>London,</HI> to the Time of Ratification in the Parliament of <HI>Scotland</HI>—, but not to the Time of Ratification in both Parliaments, as was pro∣posed.</P>
<P>The last Proposal against Pressing of Seamen, was a mani∣fest Attempt of the kind above mentioned, and a seeking an Occasion to interrupt the main Treaty, since no Body could imagine, That such a Clause could have passed in <HI>England,</HI> all their own Seamen having been lyable to be press'd into the Service of the Navy; And both Nations being to enjoy equal Privileges, this had been to put such a Disadvantage, and such Inequalities upon the <HI>English,</HI> as would have made just Complaints in <HI>England,</HI> and have been a sufficient Ob∣stacle to the whole, especially when it was remembred, that in <HI>Scotland</HI> there was no want of Seamen, but that on the contrary many Thousands of their Seamen, for want of Em∣ployment, entered themselves on Board the Men of War in Foreign Service, with the <HI>Danes, Swedes,</HI> and <HI>Hollanders;</HI> And it would be hard, That they should seek a Liberty from the <HI>English</HI> Service, which would now be their own; and at the same time, for want of Business, seek Service among Foreigners; it being alledged, That, at this time, there were
<PB N="88" REF="375"/>
16000 <HI>Scots</HI> Sailers in the <HI>Dutch</HI> Service—; This was so plain a Case, that the Proposal was rejected, and the Ar∣ticle Pass'd with only the first Amendment.</P>

<P><PB N="89" REF="376"/>
Then the Sixth Article of Union was Read, and after some Rea∣soning thereon, there was a Proposal given in for adding the fol∣lowing Clause to the end of the Sixth Article, viz. <HI>Except in so far as shall be Rectified by this Parliament, upon the Consideration of the subsequent Articles.</HI></P>
<P>Which being Read and Discoursed upon, There was another Proposal given in, for Enlarging and Explaining the said Sixth Article in these Terms, viz. <HI>And seing by the Laws of</HI> England <HI>now standing, there are Rewards granted upon the Exportation of certain kinds of Grain, wherein Oats is not specified, That, from and after the Ʋni∣on, when Oats shall be at Fifteen Shillings</HI> per <HI>Quarter, or under, There shall be paid Two Shillings and Six Pence for every Quarter of Oat Meal Exported in the Terms of the Laws, whereby Rewards are granted for Exportation of other Grains. And in respect there is a Duty upon Oats Imported into</HI> England, <HI>but no Duty upon Oat Meal, The Importing of which is a Prejudice and Discouragement to Tillage: Therefore, That, from and after the Ʋnion, the Quarter of Oat Meal be deemed equal to three Quarters of Oats, and pay Duty accordingly, when Imported to</HI> Scotland <HI>from any place whatever beyond the Sea;</HI></P>
<P>Which being likeways Read, after some further Reasoning, it was moved, That the Observations (in relation to the Balance of the Trade of this Nation) made by the Council of Trade should be laid before the Parliament.</P>
<P>And after Debate thereupon, the further Consideration of the said Sixth Article and Motions was delayed till the next <HI>Sederunt</HI> of Parliament, to be then resumed previous to all other Business: <HI>And Ordered,</HI> That the Observations made by the Council of Trade be then laid before the Parliament.</P>
<P><HI>Adjourned till to Morrow at Ten of the Clock.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="26" TYPE="observation">
<HEAD>OBSERVATION XXVI.</HEAD>
<P>The Sixth Article of Course began the Debates about Al∣lowances, Drawbacks, Prohibitions and Restrictions, which, as has been observed, were to be equal to all the Subjects—; But <HI>Scotland</HI> finding some Difference in the Value and Frequency of Import or Export of Grain, they found a Necessity to come into some Amendments here too: The Case was thus,</P>
<P><HI>England</HI> allowed a Bounty to the Exporter of Corn at all times, when the Plenty of Grain kept the Price under such a stated Rate; But it was observed there was no Bounty on the Exportation of Oats, the Reason was, because <HI>England</HI> rather wanted Oats than had them to spare, one Season with another.</P>
<P>On the other Hand, <HI>Scotland</HI> producing vast Quantities of Oats, and having a large Trade for the Exporting the same to <HI>Norway,</HI> and other Parts, the <HI>Scots</HI> Members insisted,
<PB N="90" REF="377"/>
That a Drawback should be allowed on Oats and Oat Meal Exported.</P>
<P>Another Case also required an Alteration, and this respect∣ed <HI>Ireland,</HI> which Bordering on <HI>Scotland,</HI> could and might easily throw in great Quantities of Oats or Oat Meal into <HI>Scotland,</HI> which being cheap in <HI>Ireland,</HI> would lessen the Consumption of the Growth of <HI>Scotland;</HI> There was, it seems, a Prohibition formerly laid on the Importation of Oats or Oat Meal, but this being taken off by the Union, it was requisite to make some Provision, where the <HI>English</HI> Laws was defective, which was thus,</P>
<P>The <HI>English</HI> had, by Act of Parliament, a Duty of Five Shillings Six Pence <HI>per</HI> Quarter laid upon all Oats Import∣ed, and that they thought was sufficient; But there being no more Duty on Oat Meal than on Oats, it was alledged, That the <HI>Irish</HI> might Import the Oat Meal, and afford to pay the Duty, since it was not above half the Value of the Duty of Oats, the Value of the Meal reducing the Du∣ty.</P>
<P>This therefore was provided against by this Additional Clause, which doubled the Duty upon Oat Meal Imported, by reckoning every Quarter of Oat Meal as two Quarters of Oats.</P>
<P>The Acts in Favours of the respective Burghs were in order to continue to them the several Impositions on Ale and Wine customary in <HI>Scotland,</HI> or granting them anew, being gene∣rally granted for the publick Uses of the Towns, such as build∣ing or maintaining publick Edifices, Harbours, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Just as has been practised in <HI>England</HI> in the Duties on Coals, as at <HI>London</HI> for building the Churches, at <HI>Yarmouth</HI> for their Pier; or on Ships, as at <HI>Dover</HI> for the Repair of their Harbour, and the like: And this being the last Parliament to sit in <HI>Scotland,</HI> if the Union succeeded, and all private Rights be∣ing made perpetual, or to continue to the Times they were Entailed for, this made the Towns the more solicitous to have Acts passed in their Favours at this time; The Excise upon Liquors, <HI>payable to private Hands,</HI> indeed was a No∣velty in <HI>England,</HI> and seemed to be a very odd Re∣quest at this time, That while, on one Hand, they should be pleading, that <HI>Scotland</HI> could not pay more Excise on their Liquor than they did before, at the same time they should, on the other Hand, be seeking an Additional Duty to be paid to the Burghs—; But the Duty being so small as two Pennies <HI>Scots,</HI> which is but ⅙ of a Penny on the Pint <HI>Scots,</HI> which is two Quarts <HI>English,</HI> it was generally agreed to, and principally forth at it was not extended all over the Kingdom, but only in the few Towns, that having publick Trade to support, and chargeable

Works to maintain, seem'd to have extraordinary Reasons to demand it.</P>

<P>Thereafter there was a Clause offered to be added to the said sixth Article in these Terms, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q REND="inline">"But <HI>Scotland</HI> for the space of {left blank} years after the first Day of <HI>May</HI> next, shall be free from, and no ways subject to the Prohibition and Restrictions made against Exporting of Wooll, Skins with Wooll upon them, and Woollen Yarn, which by the Oaths of the Sellers and Buyers shall be made appear to be the proper growth and product of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and Spun within the same, which shall no ways be comprehended under any of the Laws already made in <HI>England,</HI> or to be made during the space fore∣said.</Q></P>
<P>As also, a Clause in these Terms, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q REND="inline">"Excepting and Reserving the Duties upon Export and Import of such particular Commodi∣ties from which any Persons the Subjects of either Kingdom are specially Liberated and Exempted by their private Rights, which after the Union are to remain safe and intire to them in all Re∣spects.</Q></P>
<P>And sicklike, another Clause in these Terms, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q REND="inline">"That after the Union all sorts of <HI>Scots</HI> Lining, or any kind of Cloth made of Flax or Hemp, be Exported out of the United Kingdom, free of all Customs or other Impositions whatsomever.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="379"/>
And another in these Terms, <Q REND="inline">"That before the Union we may have such a <HI>Drawback</HI> adjusted as may enable us to Export Beef and Pork and Butter to the West <HI>Indies</HI> and other Foreign Parts which will be a considerable Branch of our Trade after the Union.</Q></P>
<P>And likeways another Clause in these Terms, <Q REND="inline">"That from and after the Union all Duties or Bounty Tolls, or other Exactions upon black Cattle, or any other Product of <HI>Scotland,</HI> when carried into <HI>England,</HI> or Product of <HI>England</HI> when carried into <HI>Scotland,</HI> payable either to the publick or private Persons, shall in all time coming be void and null.</Q></P>
<P>And another Clause in these Terms, <Q REND="inline">"That from and after the Union, the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland</HI> shall have Liberty for ever to Manufacture Plaiding, Fingrams, Galloway-whites, Sarges, Stock∣ings, and all sorts of Lining, as they have been in use to do, con∣form to the Regulations contained in their own Laws, and to Ex∣port the same to <HI>England</HI> or Dominions and Plantations thereto belonging, or to any other Place beyond Seas, free of any Duty or Imposition whatsomever to be laid thereon, but in case any of the Subjects of that part of United <HI>Britain</HI> now called <HI>Scotland,</HI> shall Export any other sort of Woollen Manufactory than what is above-mentioned, They are to be lyable to the Regulations and Taxes of <HI>England</HI> imposed before the Union, or to be imposed by the <HI>British</HI> Parliament after the Union.</Q></P>
<P>And it was agreed that all the Clauses above insert should be likeways Remitted to a Committee.</P>
<P>Whereupon it was Moved, That the Sixth Article and Proposals and Additional Clauses relating thereto, should be Remitted to the Committee for examining the Calculation of the <HI>Equivalent,</HI> which was agreed to.</P>
<P>Thereafter it was also moved that a further Number of the Mem∣bers of each State should be added to the said Committee, and thereupon a Vote was put, <HI>Add or not,</HI> and it carried <HI>add.</HI></P>
<P>Then it was moved, that two of each State be the Number to be added, and likeways moved, that the Number of four of each State be added, and after some Reasoning, it was put to the Vote <HI>Two</HI> or <HI>Four,</HI> and it carried <HI>Two,</HI> and the next <HI>Sederunt</HI> of Parliament ap∣pointed for choising the Additional Members.</P>
<P>Then the Seventh Article of Union was Read, and the Reasoning thereupon delayed till the next <HI>Sederunt</HI> of Parliament, to be then proceeded upon previous to all other Business, after choising of the Additional Members for the Committee.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATION XXVII.</HEAD>
<P>The Observations upon this days Minutes, will be more properly referred to the time when the Committee to whom the sixth Article was referred, make their Report.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="380"/>
The Amendment of <HI>(Drawbacks)</HI> was not scrupled, it was included before in the word <HI>Allowances,</HI> but it was such a Triffle, that no Body would Dispute it, seing it contained nothing but what was intended in the Article it self.</P>
<P>The Amendments offered were many, and the refering them to a Committee was, <HI>no Question,</HI> the best Method to come to a Settlement in the several Particulars; but this may be observed, and it was remarkable, that such was the Igno∣rance of the Objectors in these Cases, and so much had they been imposed upon in Matters of Trade, that they De∣manded inconsistent and impracticable Things, they deman∣ded Exemption from Imposts which no Body paid, they De∣manded Liberty where there were no Prohibitions, and Equa∣lities which were already agreed to.</P>
<P>For Example, Liberty of Exporting Wooll, a Thing on which the whole <HI>English</HI> Commerce depended, and without a Restraint upon which, all their Manufactures would have been Ruin'd, a Thing Impracticable in the Nature of their Trade, and which it was inconsistent with Reason to expect.</P>
<P>Then they required Liberty of Exporting Linen Duty free, whereas it was evident, had they consulted the <HI>English</HI> Affairs, they would have found, the <HI>English</HI> gave that Liberty to all the World; And if any Linen was Imported into <HI>England,</HI> what∣ever Duty it paid there, was allowed back again, upon Ex∣portation by Certificate.</P>
<P>Next, They demanded Liberty to Export their Woollen Goods free of all Duties and Customs, whereas it was known, <HI>England</HI> had, long since, taken off all Duty or Custom upon their Woollen Manufactures for several Reasons of Trade, and for the Encouragement of the Poor.</P>
<P>Again they asked Freedom of carrying their Goods &amp; Cattel into <HI>England</HI> without Customs and Toll, which it was evident, without any Provision, was the Consequence of the Union; And there could no more remain any Toll, Custom or Duty, on Passing and Repassing of Cattel or Goods between <HI>Eng∣land</HI> and <HI>Scotland,</HI> than there could in either Kingdom, from one County to another.</P>
<P>But this will further appear, when the Report of the Committee comes to be under Consideration.</P>

<P>Thereafter the Parliament (conform to the Minutes of the last <HI>Sederunt</HI>) proceeded to Elect the Additional Members to the Com∣mittee, to whom the Sixth Article, and Clauses and Proposals re∣lative thereto, are Remitted; And the Three Estates having se∣parated to their usual Places, They Returned, and Reported their respective Elections of the said Additional Members, as follows, <HI>viz.</HI> Of the Nobility, the Earls of <HI>Haddingtoun</HI> and <HI>Cromarty;</HI> Of the Commissioners for Shires, Sir <HI>Gilbert Eliot</HI> of <HI>Minto</HI> and Sir <HI>Tho∣mas Burnet</HI> of <HI>Leyes;</HI> Of the Commissioners for Burghs, Sir <HI>John Areskine</HI> and Sir <HI>Peter Halket,</HI> and the Committee was appointed to meet in the Inner-Session House to Morrow at Nine of the Clock in the Forenoon.</P>
<P>Then the Seventh Article of Union was again Read, and after some Reasoning, a Proposal was made, for an Explanation and Addition, whereby this Nation would be secured against paying more Excise for the Two Penny Ale than they now do, in these Terms, <HI>That the Thirty Four Gallons</HI> English <HI>Barrel of Beer or Ale, amounting to Twelve Gallons</HI> Scots <HI>present Measure, sold in</HI> Scotland <HI>by the Brewer at Nine Shillings Six Pence</HI> Sterling, <HI>excluding all Du∣ties, and Retailed, including Duties, and the Retailers Profite at Two Pence the</HI> Scots <HI>Pint, or Eight Part of the</HI> Scots <HI>Gallon, Be not, after the Ʋnion, lyable on Account of the present Excise upon Exciseable Li∣quors in</HI> England, <HI>To any higher Imposition than Two Shillings</HI> Ster∣ling <HI>upon the foresaid Thirty Four Gallons</HI> English <HI>Barrel, being Twelve Gallons the present</HI> Scots <HI>Measure.</HI></P>

<P>It was agreed, That the Members shall be Marked as they Vote, and that a List of their Names, as they Vote First or Second, shall be Printed, whereupon the Vote was put, Approve of the Seventh Article, as to the Excise of Ale and Beer, with the Explanation, as contained in the said <HI>First</HI> or <HI>Second</HI> Clauses, and it carried <HI>First.</HI></P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATION XXVIII.</HEAD>
<P>The Debate of this Article had made much more Noise out of the House than it did within, some People had in∣dustriously alarmed <HI>Scotland</HI> with an Apprehension, That,
<PB N="95" REF="382"/>
according to the Words of the Article, <HI>Scotland</HI> was to pay equal Excise with <HI>England;</HI> That is, that as the strong Beer or Ale in <HI>England</HI> paid Four Shillings Nine Pence <HI>per</HI> Barrel, so must the common Beer, then Brewed in <HI>Scotland,</HI> pay the same price; And it was manifest, that this was the Opini∣on of several Members of Parliament, by their Speeches on this Occasion in the House, as well as without.</P>
<P>On the other Hand, others pretended to bring all the Ale Brewed then in <HI>Scotland</HI> down to the Denomination of <HI>English</HI> small Beer, as being not sold for more than some of the Table Beer in <HI>England</HI> was sold for, which paid but as small Beer after the Rate of One Shilling Three Pence <HI>per</HI> Barrel.</P>
<P>I shall be very far from offering to make any part of this History Officious, in giving an Account of any mean Share the Author had in this Affair, yet I cannot omit relating this part of the Concern which casually happened to him in this particular; And it may be mentioned for the sake of the Jest it made in the Town, <HI>viz.</HI> That while it was thought well done to have a Share in stating the Proportions of the Excise, several Persons pretended to the Title of being the first Contrivers of it; but when afterwards, on some Cla∣mour raised upon the Inequality of the Proportions, the Con∣trivers began to be blamed, and a little threatned <HI>a-la-Mob,</HI> then it was <HI>D. F.</HI> made it all, and he was to be Stoned for it; And afterward, when those Differences appearing but Trifles, were by the Prudence of the Commissioner reconciled, then they would willingly have reassumed the Honour of be∣ing the first Formers of this Affair.</P>
<P>It was indeed no small Difficulty at first, how to state a <HI>Medium</HI> between the two Nations; It had been laid down as a Maxim, <HI>That</HI> Scotland <HI>could, by no means, bear the high Excises paid for their strong Beer in</HI> England; It was also absolutely necessary to regard doing Justice to <HI>England,</HI> who, paying Four Shillings Nine Pence <HI>per</HI> Barrel Excise, would have had a great Hardship, if <HI>Scotland</HI> should have had all their Beer as <HI>English</HI> small Beer.</P>
<P>Again, the <HI>Scots</HI> Ale which was sold in the Publick Houses, and commonly called <HI>TIPPONY,</HI> was in no Proportion like the <HI>English</HI> strong Beer, either in Price or in Strength, being fold for one Penny the <HI>Chappin,</HI> which was near the <HI>English</HI> Quart, by Retail, after paying a subsequent Excise to the Cities or Burghs, and not one Half, or above one Third as strong as the <HI>English</HI> Ale or strong Beer. Upon this I shall impartially set down the Matter of Fact.</P>
<P>The Author of this being sent for by the Committee of Parliament then sitting, <HI>the same to whom the Sixth Article was committed, as is above said,</HI> attended them at their Meet∣ing in the Lord <HI>Cesnock</HI>'s Chamber; And being called in,
<PB N="96" REF="383"/>
the Committee did him the Honour to tell him, they were informed he had spent some Thoughts on the Affair of the Excises, and that he had made some Calculations; They told him, the Parliament were coming upon the Debate of the Seventh Article, and the great Difficulty before them was, to find out a <HI>Medium</HI> between the <HI>Scots</HI> and the <HI>English</HI> Ex∣cise, so as might make it tolerable to <HI>Scotland,</HI> and not give <HI>England</HI> Reason to take Umbrage, or complain of Injustice.</P>
<P>He frankly owned, he thought it would be very hard, and proposed what he had formerly insisted on, <HI>viz.</HI> That the <HI>Scots</HI> Ale or Tippony being sold for no more Money, than the Houshold or Table Beer in the City of <HI>London,</HI> which is called Eight Shilling Beer, and is often sold for Ten Shillings <HI>per</HI> Barrel, the <HI>Scots</HI> ought also to pay no more.</P>
<P>But the Lord President of the Session objected, That the <HI>English</HI> would never be satisfied with that Payment, as not being a just Proportion; That the Act of Parliament was express, That all Beer above the Price of Six Shillings <HI>per</HI> Barrel should pay as strong Beer; That those kinds of Beer, called Eight Shil∣ling Beer, were generally Mixtures after the Excise was paid; and that the Denomination in <HI>England</HI> being but of two kinds, it would not be possible to place this on either Head, and to leave it to the Method of the Eight Shilling Beer in <HI>London,</HI> would be to lay all <HI>Scotland</HI> at the Mercy of the Ex∣cise Officers, which would be unsufferable.</P>
<P>This Discourse put a Thought in the Authors Head just in the Moment, upon which he told their Lordships, he thought a Proportion to both Sides might be formed, taking its Rise from the Price of the Beer, and Value of the Excise in either Kingdom, and that he thought, he could form it for them, so as that it should not grieve either Party.</P>
<P>Upon which their Lordships desired him to try, he took the Pen and Ink, and immediately stated the Case thus,</P>
<P>There are in <HI>England</HI> but two Denominations of Excise∣able Beer, small and strong.</P>
<P>The small was supposed in the Act at Six Shillings <HI>per</HI> Barrel, and payed One Shilling Three Pence <HI>per</HI> Barrel Excise, which is excluded out of the Six Shillings <HI>per</HI> Barrel.</P>
<P>The strong was supposed at Eighteen or Twenty Shillings <HI>per</HI> Barrel, and payed Four Shillings Nine Pence Excise, which is included in the Eighteen or Twenty Shillings <HI>per</HI> Barrel.</P>
<P>There is in <HI>Scotland</HI> but one Denomination of Excise∣able Beer, <HI>which we call, as above for Ʋse sake,</HI> Tippony.</P>
<P>This was sold for about Nine Shillings Six Pence <HI>Sterling per</HI> Twelve <HI>Scots</HI> Gallons to the Retailer, and payed Twenty Three Pence <HI>sterling</HI> Duty, which is not included in the Nine Shillings Six Pence.</P>
<P><HI>Note,</HI> Twelve <HI>Scots</HI> Gallons was supposed to hold much about the <HI>English</HI> Ale Gauge of Thirty Four Gal∣lons,
<PB N="97" REF="384"/>
there were some Fractions or small Differences, which the Committee did not Examine into; Of which by it self.</P>
<P>Taking then this <HI>English</HI> Excise from Twenty shilling <HI>per</HI> Barrel downward to Nine Shillings Six Pence; or from Six Shillings <HI>per</HI> Barrel upward to Nine Shillings Six Pence; and then Calculate the Excise from either of these Extremes, and the middle seemed to be a just Excise; and this Project had two happy Circumstances in it, which exactly supplyed the Difficulty.</P>
<P><HI>For Example.</HI></P>
<P>The Price of the <HI>Scots</HI> strong Beer being Nine Shillings Six∣pence <HI>per</HI> Barrel <HI>exclusive</HI> of the Excise, and the Price of the <HI>English</HI> Beer <HI>reckoning it at Twenty Shillings</HI> per <HI>Barrel</HI> inclusive <HI>of the Excise,</HI> being Fourteen Shillings Three Pence <HI>per</HI> Barrel, <HI>exclusive</HI> of the Excise, Nine Shillings Sixpence is to Fourteen Shillings Three pence, as Nineteen to Fourteen Shillings Nine∣pence.</P>
<P>Thus,</P>
<P>9 <HI>sh.</HI> 6 <HI>d. sterling</HI> is Pence 114, the Price of the <HI>Scots</HI> strong Beer <HI>exclusive</HI> of the Excise.</P>
<P>14 <HI>sh.</HI> 3. <HI>d. sterling</HI> is Pence 171—<HI>Ditto.</HI> of the <HI>English.</HI></P>
<P>Two Thirds of 171, which is 14 <HI>sh.</HI> 3 <HI>d.</HI> is 114, which is 9 <HI>sh.</HI> 6 <HI>d.</HI></P>
<P>Two Thirds of 57 Pence, which is 4 <HI>sh.</HI> 9 <HI>d.</HI> is 19 <HI>d.</HI> which is the <HI>Medium</HI> of Excise this way.</P>
<P>Again, if you begin at the lowest Rate of the Excise, and the lowest Price of Beer, and from thence draw the Proporti∣on upward, then Two Shillings the present stated Excise, is the same to Twelve, as Fifteen Pence is to Six Shil. or so near it, as they sell the Beer <HI>inclusive:</HI> So that the difference is of no extraordinary Consequence; <HI>For Example,</HI></P>
<P>Twelve Gallons <HI>Scots</HI> paying Two Shillings Excise, is sold for Twelve Shilling <HI>sterling</HI> including the Duty.</P>
<P>One Barrel <HI>English</HI> small <HI>Beer,</HI> paying One Shilling Three Pence Excise, is sold at Seven Shillings Six Pence <HI>per</HI> Barrel <HI>inclusive</HI> of the Duty.</P>
<P><HI>Note,</HI> Two Shilling is One sixth Part of Twelve Shilling, and One Shilling Three Pence is One sixth Part of Seven Shillings Six Pence.</P>
<P>Thus the Excise of both Kingdoms stands upon the same Foot, and are an Exact proportion to one another; and ha∣ving drawn a rough Scheme of these Proportions, the Com∣missioners Ordered them to be laid before them, Finished the
<PB N="98" REF="385"/>
next Morning, which was done; And the Author had the Honour done him to have them Accepted, which was a full Reward to him, and compleatly suited to his Expectations; And they stand in the Treaty of Union in his very Words.</P>
<P>This is put down here, not at all to Value the Merit of the Author upon, but however, to do himself Justice against as∣suming Pretenders.</P>
<P>As to the Mistake between the Brewers and the Excise Of∣fice, which fell out afterward in <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and which some People industriously strove to blow into a Flame, it is explained in its Place.</P>

<P>Moved, that the Observations made by the Council of Trade in Relation to the Export and Import of this Nation, and a Ballance of our Trade be laid before the Committee, to whom the sixth Ar∣ticle of Union is remitted, and the same was accordingly ordered; as also, the Clerks of the said Council of Trade were ordered to transmit to the said Committee all Observations, Papers and Re∣cords relating thereto.</P>
<P>Then the Lord Chancellor acquainted the Parliament, <HI>That the Secret Council at their last Meeting, had under their Consideration several Accounts of Irregular and Tumultuary Meetings, by some People of the common and meanest Degree in Arms, and of Abuses committed by them at</HI> Glasgow, <HI>Stewartry of</HI> Kirkcudbright <HI>and</HI> Dumfreis, <HI>and several places of</HI> Lanerk <HI>Shire, and that there were Papers dropt inviting People to take up Arms, and to provide Ammunition and Provisions in order to their Marching to disturb the Parliament, all which he was directed by the Right Honourable the Lords of Her Majesties Secret Council to lay before the Parliament, to the effect proper Methods might be resolved upon for preventing the evil Consequences of such Practices;</HI> and thereafter pre∣sented a Letter from the Magistrates of <HI>Dumfreis</HI> to Her Majesties Ad∣vocat, <HI>Bearing an account of the Abuses and Tumultuary Meetings in that Place, with a Declaration emitted by those who met, which was affixt on the Mercat Cross of</HI> Dumfreis, and both were Read.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATION XXIX.</HEAD>
<P>The Affair of the Rabbles in the Country came now before the Parliament, for things were come to that Height in the Coun∣try, that it was no longer to be Tampered with; The Party who opposed the Union had so far prevailed upon the People, that they began to break all Bounds; at <HI>Dumfries</HI> the Articles of the Union were burnt at the Market Cross, by a Number of People in Arms, tho' they were not near so many as was Reported at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> where they industriously enlarged those Reports, to Intimidate the Party that was for the Union, and, <HI>if possible,</HI> to set the Mob in <HI>Edinburgh</HI> to Work again; But the Guards there did their Duty so effectually, that there was no more Appearance in the Street, tho' loud Threatnings were made of it.</P>
<P>As to the Burning the Articles, it was true, That a Num∣ber of People being got together, did publickly burn the Ar∣ticles of the Union, as concluded at <HI>London,</HI> with the List of the Names of the Commissioners of the Treaty, and did affix a Paper upon the Cross of <HI>Dumfreis,</HI> which they called, <HI>Reasons for and Designs in Burning the Articles, &amp;c.</HI> after having read the said Paper from the Cross.</P>
<P>This Paper was afterwards printed, and the Printer being ordered to be apprehended, fled for it till the first Heat was over, and then he appeared again, and was not questioned for it.</P>
<P>The Copy of the said Paper is added in the <HI>Appendix</HI> to this Work, <HI>N<SUP>o</SUP>. E x.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="387"/>
But it is to be noted, That whereas the Paper mentions Squadrons of Foot and Horse, and the Report was of 5000 and 7000 People, 5000 in Arms that entered the Town, and 7000 in the Hills to support them—; It was all Ru∣mour, the most that appeared in this Action being about 200, and these in no sort of Military Order or Equippage, as I have noted before.</P>
<P>Yet was this Disorder improved to a great Height, and particularly as it was improved to make the Government ap∣prehend, the Western People were resolved to concern them∣selves in this Affair, and to take Arms against the Govern∣ment; The Parliament was very sensible of this, and being very loth to have any Force made use of, they tryed all the Methods possible, by Proclamations, and publick Repealing the Licence for Mustering, to take away all Opportunity of Assembling together, by which the People might be drawn into the Snare.</P>
<P>It is observable, That even, in the House, there appeared some, who were very loth to have these Rabbles discourag∣ed and discountenanced; And tho I could give more par∣ticular Instances of it, yet this of Objecting against the Cer∣tainty of the Accounts, viz. <HI>That it did not appear, that there was a particular Information of any Tumultuary Meetings, or Irregular Convocations;</HI> This, I say, is a clear Proof of it, for these Objectors were openly against preventing the Mustering or Assembling the Lieges according to the Act of Security, and gave this Suggestion, viz. <HI>Want of Information</HI> for a Reason, whereas the Matter of Fact was, That the Lord Commissio∣ner had real and direct Information of this Affair of <HI>Dumfries,</HI> and of private Emissaries gone abroad to excite the People to take Arms, and the respective Meetings of these Agents or Emissaries in the County of <HI>Lanerk,</HI> and elsewhere, more than sufficient to justifie the Precautions mentioned in the Minute.</P>
<P>Upon this Debate the Proclamation was Voted, and the Act of Security, so far as it concerned this Case, was repealed, which had various Effects in several parts of the Country, in some places it really crush'd and prevented their assembling, at <HI>Glasgow</HI> it irritated and provoked them, and made them more Furious than before—; But generally it had a very good Effect, for it took away the pretence which any of the Lairds or Heads of Clans might have had before, to have ap∣peared with the People in Arms, and under the pretence whereof, they might have been exonered in Law, while an Act of Parliament was in Force to protect them, for no Man could say, if a Gentleman gathered 100 or 500 Men together, that he had any ill Design, and tho' he Arm'd them and Train'd them, and kept them together, he could not be accused for any Crime, because the Law allowed him to do so,
<PB N="101" REF="388"/>
under pretence of Arming and Disciplining the Fencible Men, as Authorized by the Act of Security.</P>
<P>This appeared therefore so necessary at this Time, That a Proposal was immediately brought in to Repeal that part of the Act of Security, at least to Suspend it for a Time; There was great Opposition made to this Proposal, and abun∣dance of Speeches made Applauding the Act of Security, how difficultly it was obtained, and how much of the Liber∣ty of <HI>Scotland</HI> depended upon it—; But the Motion be∣ing seconded with the Necessity of the Time, and the Causes as above, and withal the Proposal being made to extend it only to the Time of the present Session of Parliament, as <HI>per</HI> the Vote, it admitted the less Opposition.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATION XXX.</HEAD>
<P>The Debates of this Day were principally taken up about Re∣pealing the Clause of the Act of Security anent Arming &amp; Exer∣cising as before, and great Struggles were made to preserve the Clause, but it look'd so like Abetting the Tumults which were now in their Height, that no Man could speak heartily to it, for all Men pretended, at least, to disowne the Design of Rabbling the Parliament, and breaking up their Consultations by Tumults and Violence, but yet, as far as they could drive it, they opposed this Vote.</P>
<P>At last it was carried, and the Act was touched, and is printed in that part of this Work, Intituled, <HI>Of the carrying on the Treaty in</HI> Scotland, <HI>Folio</HI> 74.</P>
<P>The Paper about Burning the Articles at <HI>Dumfreis</HI> was now censur'd, and the Printer, kept out of the way some time, but no Proceedings were made on it, only that the Paper was burnt by the Hangman according to the Order.</P>
<P>The Difficulties of the Sixth, Seventh and Eighth Articles, being generally respecting Taxes, Excises, Salt, Exportations and Importations, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of Trade; were referred to the Com∣mittee
<PB N="103" REF="390"/>
to settle, and shall be spoken to as they came again before the House.</P>
<P>It is to be observed, among the great Croud of Addresses that had been brought into the House, one of this day from the Burgh of <HI>Air,</HI> differed from the Generality, and was not as others, <HI>against an Ʋnion with</HI> England <HI>in the Terms of the Ar∣ticles;</HI> But was for <HI>Rectification of the Articles, and Ease of Taxes;</HI> This had some seeming Softness in it, and appeared more reasonable than the other, and the Parliament seem'd General∣ly Inclined to enter upon Rectifications and Ease of Taxes, and the References to the Committee were with that Prospect, the Difficulty lay how to Regulate and so Govern the said Re∣gulations, as to make them equal to both Kingdoms, Reason∣able in <HI>Scotland</HI> to Ask, and Reasonable in <HI>England</HI> to Com∣ply with, that so the Poor might, as far as possible, be Eased, the Circumstances of both Kingdoms be Considered, and <HI>Eng∣land</HI> not be Imposed upon, for they were not Ignorant that there were Vigilant Endeavours at Work, to obtain such Amendments as <HI>England</HI> should stick at, and as might, at least, occasion the Treaty to be sent back to <HI>Scotland</HI> for further Amendments; and then they would be able to raise such fur∣ther Difficulties, that the Time might Expire upon their hands, and then the whole Work had been to do over again.</P>

<P>The Ninth of the Articles of the Union, could admit of no Debate, but whether the Eight Months Cess agreed to be the Proportion of <HI>Scotland,</HI> to the Land Tax of Four Shillings <HI>per</HI> Pound upon Rent in <HI>England,</HI> were founded upon a true Scale of Equalities: I have already stated this Question in the Observations on the Minutes of the Treaty at <HI>London,</HI> and need not repeat them; but observe, that the Proposal now made of Six Months Cess, to the <HI>English</HI> Two Million Land-Tax, had no Arguments at all to support it, that could be made good by just Proportions, neither were there any Schemes offered to the House, to Form any other Proportions from, or to prove any thing of Equalities upon; So the making this Offer produced no other Effect, than the bare reciting the several Calculates and Proportions upon which the other was Formed, and which had been approved in the Treaty at <HI>London,</HI> and upon an Easie Examination, they ap∣peared so Just, that nothing could be offered of any real

Weight, to move the Parliament to alter it; So this Clause past with small Difficulty.</P>
<P>The Tenth, Eleventh, Twelfth, Thirteenth Articles re∣quired no Debate, consisting only of Exemptions to <HI>Scotland</HI> from several Duties and Taxes paid in <HI>England,</HI> which could not be Extended to <HI>Scotland,</HI> such as Stampt Paper, which in <HI>Scotland</HI> could not consist with the Methods of the Law, nor be born in Trade; or the Window Lights, which was De∣termined not to be continued in <HI>England,</HI> and the Coal and Culm, which according to the Method of that Tax in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> did not reach to the Coal in <HI>Scotland,</HI> other than such as should be carried into <HI>England,</HI> or Exported into Foreign parts, which were expresly provided for in the Clause, in these words, <HI>That</HI> Scotland <HI>shall be charged with the same Du∣ties as in</HI> England, <HI>for all Coal, Culm, and Cynders not consumed in</HI> Scotland: As to the Malt Tax in <HI>England,</HI> which was the Thirteenth Article, it was Temporary, and could not Extend to <HI>Scotland</HI> without a new Law, and that was provided against in the next Article.</P>

<P>The Parliament was then acquainted, That the Report of the Committee anent the Calculation of the Equivalent remitted to them was ready, and in the Clerks Hands, and that all Persons concerned may see the same and grounds whereupon it proceeds, before the Report be brought in to the Parliament.</P>
<P>Thereafter the Fourteenth Article of Union was again Read, and an Amendment and Addition thereto was offered in these Terms, <HI>And that the part of the Ʋnited Kingdom, now called</HI> Scotland, <HI>shall not in all time coming be charged with any Malt Tax, or any other Customs, Excises, Taxes or any other Burdens or Duties than these con∣sented to in this Treaty.</HI></P>

<DIV2 N="32" TYPE="observation">
<HEAD>OBSERVATION XXXII.</HEAD>
<P>The Affair of the Malt-Tax came upon the Stage, in the Debate of the Fourteenth Article, because it was but a Tem∣porary Tax in <HI>England;</HI> and therefore was to be Considered amongst these Things, which the Parliament of <HI>Great Britain</HI> might hereafter lay Taxes upon.</P>
<P>The Treaters had Acquiesced in a Supposition offered in <HI>En∣gland</HI> in these Words, <HI>That the Parliament of</HI> Great-Britain <HI>could not be supposed to lay any sorts of Burdens upon the Ʋnited King∣dom, but what they shall find of Necessity at that time for the Preser∣vation and Good of the whole and with due Regard to the Circumstan∣ces and Abilities of every part of the Ʋnited Kingdom; Therefore it is agreed, that there be no further Exemption insisted upon for any part of the Ʋnited Kingdom, but that the Consideration of any Exemp∣tions beyond what are already agreed on in this Treaty shall be left to the Determination of the Parliament of</HI> Great-Britain; Upon this Account they did not insist upon Exemptions of Duties any further, than the said Duties were then Extended in <HI>England.</HI> But People were now come a greater length, and they did not care to Trust the <HI>British</HI> Parliament so far—; They had encouraged all manner of Jealousies of the <HI>British</HI> Parliament, the People had received no Notions, but of <HI>Scotlands</HI> being always Opprest by them, both in Civil and Religious Con∣cerns: And that therefore nothing was to be left to them. That the <HI>British</HI> Parliament was to be Fenced against as a declared Enemy, and the Representatives of <HI>Scotland</HI> being like to be but a Few, <HI>viz. Fourty Five</HI> to Five Hundred and Thirteen, they were to be Crushed by Number, Outvoted and Disregarded in every Thing relating to <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>There is no more Wonder to be made, that they were for making every Thing secure, and settling it to Points and Punctilios, who had entertain'd such Notions as these; The Malt-Tax therefore being acknowledged Insupportable in <HI>Scot∣land,</HI>
<PB N="107" REF="394"/>
and the Treaters having Determined it so, and Exemp∣ted <HI>Scotland</HI> from it, for as long Time as it was now in Force in <HI>England,</HI> the Parliament building upon that Supposition, resolve to Determine the time of the Exemption, that they may be sure of it.</P>
<P>It was moved very briskly, That <HI>Scotland</HI> should for ever be Exempt from it; but that went not far, as appears in the Vote, some were for a certain Term of years, some for an Exemption during the War, others for a certain Number of years after the War.</P>
<P>The Exemption during the War, seem'd the most rational, because it was known, that the Tax upon Malt was a Tem∣porary Tax, given but upon the Emergence of the War, and as the Gentry of <HI>England</HI> were with difficulty brought to sub∣mit to it, so they were not Easie under it, and would never suffer it to continue after the War, having for that End given it but from year to year, that it might not be entangled with Anticipations, or appropriated to Payments that should con∣tinue it; And therefore to Exempt <HI>Scotland</HI> during the War, was a total Exemption in its kind, and seemed sufficient—; This was Opposed <HI>a little,</HI> but as being a Point gain'd, those who sought the Regulation of Conditions only, came freely into it, and so it passed.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATION XXXIII.</HEAD>
<P>The Debate of this Day run only upon the Affair men∣tioned before, <HI>viz.</HI> Whether they should depend upon the <HI>British</HI> Parliament maintaining a just and equal Regard to the Good of the whole United Island after the Union, and that they would have Respect to the Circumstances of every part in their laying on Taxes, or whether they should pin them down in all time coming, that no other Burdens or Taxes should be laid on, than those already mentioned.</P>
<P>The Supposition of the Parliament of <HI>Britains</HI> being par∣tial against <HI>Scotland,</HI> and the Representatives of <HI>Scotland</HI> be∣ing few, being oppress'd and out-voted, as I have noted al∣ready, tho' it was a Popular Notion, and improved to an extravagant Height without Doors, yet it had not obtained so, as to be owned in the Parliament, nor indeed could any Man, with just Reason, have supposed such a thing; And therefore, to offer at a positive Limitation on the Parliament of <HI>Britain,</HI> seemed to have something in it very harsh.</P>
<P>Again it was alledged, That, to Limit the Parliament of <HI>Britain,</HI> not to lay on any other Customs, Excises, Taxes, Duties or Burdens, than those consented to in this Act, was to take away the Power from the People of <HI>Britain,</HI> to conform their Affairs even to their own Circumstances, since the Time might come, when some of these Duties might become bur∣densome, that now were not so, and others, which now would be burdensome, might be more for the Publick Service; but to ty the Parliament down absolutely as in this Clause, would be to Limit them from making Alterations in the Publick Taxes, tho' apparently for the Publick Advantage, and would in effect take from them that Power, for which they were really constituted, <HI>viz.</HI> To Dispose the Peoples Purses, and Redress their Grievances.</P>
<P>It was long Argued, That the Parliament ought to be Li∣mited in this Case, because of the Danger there was of <HI>Scot∣land</HI> being burdened with Intolerable Taxes, and of the pre∣sent Circumstances of <HI>Scotland</HI> which were allowed to be un∣able to bear them; That under the pretence of Alteration of Taxes, Oppressive Duties might be laid upon <HI>Scotland,</HI> which, tho' they might be tolerable in <HI>England,</HI> were not so here, and they ought to provide against them.</P>
<P>But it was Resolved at last into this, That all future Con∣tingencies must be left to a <HI>British</HI> Parliament, and the Words of the Articles contained a sufficient Reason for so doing, <HI>viz. It could not be supposed, That the Parliament of</HI> Great-Britain <HI>will ever lay any sorts of Burdens upon the Ʋnited King∣dom, but what they shall find of Necessity, at that time, for the Preservation and Good of the whole, and with due Regard to the Cir∣cumstances</HI>
<PB N="109" REF="396"/>
<HI>and Abilities of every part of the Ʋnited Kingdom; Therefore it is Agreed, That there be no further Exemption insist∣ed upon for any part of the Ʋnited Kingdom, but that the Consideration of any Exemptions, beyond what are already agreed on in this Treaty, shall be left to the Determination of the Parlia∣ment of</HI> Great-Britain.</P>
<P>And thus, with some Difficulty, the Clause was pass'd, without any further Amendment.</P>

<P>The Fifteenth Article of Union Read, and thereafter the first Clause or Paragraph thereof again read; As also the Report brought in from the Committee for Examining the Calculation of the Equi∣valent being as follows; The Committee of Parliament, to whom the considering of the Calculation of the Equivalent was remitted, having considered the Report made to them by Doctor <HI>James Gregory</HI> Professor of the Mathematicks in the Colledge of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and the Report made by Doctor <HI>Thomas Bowar</HI> Profes∣sor of the Mathematicks in the Colledge of <HI>Aberdeen,</HI> of their seve∣ral and respective Examinations of the Calcul, and Grounds thereof, whereupon the Commissioners, in Treating the Article for establish∣ing the Equivalent, did proceed, and also having considered the Re∣port of the Sub-committee thereanent, they find, That the Compu∣tation of the Equivalent mentioned in the Article is just, and that the Calcul is exact, and well founded in the Terms, and in Manner expressed in the said Article.</P>
<P>Whereupon it was proposed, to delay the Consideration of the said Fifteenth Article, until Reports be brought in, in Relation to the Sixth and Eighth Articles, from the Committee, to whom the saids Articles are remitted.</P>
<P>And after Debate thereon, it was agreed, That the proceeding on the Fifteenth Article shall not be understood to be any Determination of the Sixth or Eighth Articles that stand committed; But that the Reasoning and Voting on the Sixth and Eighth Ar∣ticles shall be intire.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATION XXXIV.</HEAD>
<P>They were now come to the great Article of the Equiva∣lent; It had been offered at in the {left blank} Article, and by Consent referred to a Committee, which Committee had spent a great deal of Time upon it, had Examined all the Calcula∣tions made by the Clerks imployed in <HI>London</HI> during the Trea∣ty, had cast up the Interests, and the Valuation of Years, to reduce every Annual payment upon ready Money, upon equal Rebates &amp; Allowances, and their Report was now brought in, by which it appears, That the Calculations made in <HI>England</HI> were very just, so that no Objection lay against that part of the Work.</P>
<P>The first Question then was, Why <HI>Scotland</HI> should concern it self in paying <HI>Englands</HI> Debts at all, and on this Head it is necessary to be something large, since the Learned Debates on this Head filled the whole Nation, and the Opposers of the Union advanced abundance of Objections against the very Thing called an Equivalent, in the first place, as needless and impertinent; That <HI>England</HI> should pay its own Debts, and keep her own Money, and the like; That, to make <HI>Scotland</HI>
<PB N="111" REF="398"/>
pay Taxes, and then give her an Equivalent, was doing no∣thing as to Equalities, for that tho' it might be an Equality, Nationally speaking, it had no Personal Justice or Equality at all, since the private Persons that should pay it, would never receive any Equivalent for the Injury they received.</P>
<P>Some Answers to this I shall set down here, as they were argued in the House, and after made publick by an Honou∣rable Member of the Parliament, now Baron of the Exchequer in <HI>Scotland,</HI> Mr. <HI>Clark</HI> of <HI>Pennycook.</HI>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That no Communication of the Trade of <HI>England</HI> can be given to the Subjects of <HI>Scotland,</HI> unless we are sa∣tisfied to pay equal Customs and Duties upon Export and Import, and equal Excises. The Reason is plain, for other∣wise the Merchants residing in <HI>Scotland,</HI> would be put in a Condition to Ruine the whole Trade of <HI>England.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That an <HI>Equality of Excises</HI> in both Kingdoms, is as necessary as an <HI>Equality of Customs,</HI> for not only all imme∣diate Burdens on <HI>Trade</HI> are to be regarded, but even these things which Affect and Influence Trade.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. That tho' a <HI>Federal Ʋnion</HI> was Practicable between the two kingdoms (as I believe it is not) yet even by that Union, we behoved to undergo the Burden of equal Customs and Excises, otherwise there could be no Com∣munication of Trade.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. That a great part of <HI>the</HI> English <HI>Customs and Excises</HI> is appropriated towards Payment of their Debts; so that the paying of the <HI>English</HI> Debts, and the paying of equal Customs and Excises, are almost reciprocal Terms to signi∣fie one and the same thing, or otherwise, that these Cu∣stoms and Excises payed after the Union, will be appro∣priated towards paying our own Debts, which is the same, as shall more fully appear hereafter.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. That these Debts (being after the Union, to be called <HI>The Debts of</HI> Great-Britain) are so necessary and in∣evitable Burdens on <HI>Scotland,</HI> that neither by an Incorpo∣rating or Federal Union with <HI>England,</HI> can <HI>Scotland</HI> be free of 'em, since as is said before, they are included and wrap∣ped up in the very Notion of equal Customs and Excises.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>From these Positions it follows, That since under all sorts of Union whatsomever, with a Communication of Trade, we must be Subjected to <HI>equal Customs and Excises,</HI> and that a great part of these is applyed towards Payment of the <HI>Debts of</HI> England, therefore in common Justice, a Provision behoved to be made to <HI>Scotland,</HI> for re-imbursing what we shall be charged on the Score of these Debts, which by <HI>this Article of the Treaty,</HI> is called <HI>An Equivalent.</HI></P>

in the <HI>English</HI> Debts, for no Man can be properly said to pay a Debt for another, when the Money is either advan∣ced before hand to the Payer, or at furthest, the next Mo∣ment after it is payed out, which will be <HI>Scotlands</HI> Case.</P>
<P>It was evident that a Communication of Trade was the In∣terest of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and was the clearest Advantage on the <HI>Scots</HI> side, and most Unexceptionable in the whole Treaty; It was impossible this Communication of Trade could be E∣stablished, and could be entirely Free, unless an Equality of Customs, Excises, and of all sorts of Payments were settled at the same Time; So that these People who were so back∣ward to come into the <HI>English</HI> Debts, were leading into a Re∣jecting the only Advantage, which they themselves acknow∣ledged was to be had by the Union.</P>
<P>The Equality of Excises and Customs being thus absolute∣ly necessary, the <HI>English</HI> Debts came to be concerned, be∣cause the Customs and Excises of <HI>England</HI> being appropri∣ated as Funds to pay the Interests of Annuities, and such In∣cumbrances, the same Duties in <HI>Scotland</HI> would of course run in the same Channel, come into the same Charge, and under the same Incumbrances, as it could not be otherwise, without running Things into all manner of Confusion.</P>
<P>The Treaters in <HI>London</HI> had been convinc'd of this, and therefore readily came into it, demanding an Equivalent to <HI>Scotland,</HI> suited to so much of the <HI>Scots</HI> Revenue, as should be so appropriated to the payment of the <HI>English</HI> Debts.</P>
<P>But it was the hardest Thing in the World, to make the People in <HI>Scotland</HI> apprehend it—; Not but that those who were more immediately concern'd in the Debating it, understood it well enough; But it serv'd as a Handle to Rally the Union, &amp; the Thing being rendred as Intricate to the com∣mon People as possible, that they might be the more moved to Oppose it; These Ignorantly running away with a Noti∣on, that <HI>Scotland</HI> was to pay the <HI>English</HI> Debts, began to Rage at the Treaters again, and cry out, <HI>They were Sold and Betray∣ed;</HI> to tell them of an Equivalent, was to say nothing, and as, many did not understand it, so they that did, would not seem to understand it; the very Word became Proverbial, and was the Jest of Conversation, till the Aversion to it ren∣red it in a manner Contemptible. To bring <HI>Scotland</HI> in to pay the <HI>English</HI> Debts! What was not <HI>Scotland</HI> Poor enough already? Was this the Advantage of the Union! It could not be suffered, and the Treaters had Betrayed them: Such Discourse as this was the Subject of the common Peoples Con∣versation, and the Answering them with the story of an E∣quivalent to be paid them, was to tell them something which they neither understood, nor entered into the Examination of.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="400"/>
It would be very hard to describe, how this kind of Dis∣course irritated the poor People, and how they were imposed upon in the daily Accounts spread of this new Wonder, cal∣led <HI>The Equivalent,</HI> of which Calculations were made publick, representing, That in a year <HI>Scotland</HI> would Repay all the Money advanced from <HI>England,</HI> by the increase of Customs and Excises; &amp; so after that Rate, notwithstanding of the Equi∣valent, <HI>Scotland</HI> would be drawn into an Entail of Taxes for an Hundred Years, to clear off the vast Debt of Twenty Mil∣lions, which <HI>England</HI> was now liable to.</P>
<P>I shall have occasion to Answer this in a subsequent Observa∣tion. But I can not but <HI>Note,</HI> That by a due Calculation laid be∣fore the Parliament, it was made very plain, That <HI>England</HI> would be so far from being Re-imburst in a Year, <HI>as above,</HI> that reckoning the common Interest of the Money advanced in the Equivalent, with the <HI>Medium</HI> of Years in which great part of the Duties the other People had Calculated from, was to Expire, the Equivalent Advanced in Money to <HI>Scotland</HI> would not be Re-payed in Ninety Years.</P>
<P>Yet was not all this able to Allay the Prejudices of the People, at the Affair of paying the <HI>English</HI> Debt, which they run away with so eagerly, and so universally Raged against, that had not the Rabbles been in good time Crush'd before, and that so effectually, that they could not begin again, it was thought this very thing would have Influenced them to a more dangerous Degree than any thing.</P>
<P>But this was offer'd by degrees, the Work of this Day was only to Debate the first Clause, <HI>viz.</HI> Whether <HI>Scotland</HI> should be intirely free from the <HI>English</HI> Debts, or whether they should come in to the Appropriations of the <HI>English</HI> Duties, accep∣ting of an Equivalent, and after a very Warm Debate, the Case was carried, as by the Minute.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATION XXXV.</HEAD>
<P>The Commmittee to whom the several Articles about Trade were refer'd, began now to make their Reports, and begin∣ning with the Sixth Article concerning Equalities of Allow∣ances and Encouragements, they made their Report about the Allowances on Exporting <HI>Victual,</HI> by which is understood <HI>Corn</HI> only, which is commonly called <HI>Victual</HI> in <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>The Allowance here offered by the Committee, was on these Considerations, It had been used in <HI>England</HI> to give a Bounty or Allowance on the Exportation of Grain, to En∣courage the Merchant to Export it, being a sure Rule in Trade, that all the meer Product of the Earth which can be spared and Exported Abroad, over and above the necessary Con∣sumption of the Nation, is clear-Gain to the publick Stock.</P>
<P>But Oats in <HI>England</HI> had no Allowance or Bounty on the Exportation, because it was generally supposed, That <HI>Eng∣land</HI> had never any Quantity of Oats to spare more than they Consumed among themselves, but were rather alwise ready to Buy Oats from Abroad, than to Export them.</P>
<P>On the other hand, Oats being the principal kind of Grain Sowed in <HI>Scotland,</HI> it was equally necessary to Encourage the Exporting of Oats, as it was to Encourage the Exporting Wheat in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>But this was Answered, by telling them, that there was no need of proposing a Bounty upon the Exportation of Oats, for that <HI>England</HI> would always take off what ever Quantity of Oats they would part with, and to offer a Bounty for Expor∣tation of that Abroad, which was really wanted at Home,
<PB N="115" REF="402"/>
was Absurd, contrary to the Rules of Trade, and the Nature of the Thing. <HI>Further</HI> it was offered, That should a Bounty be offer'd on the Exportation of Oats, the Out-ports in <HI>England,</HI> who now supply <HI>London,</HI> lying ready for the Trade to <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Flanders,</HI> would send all their Oats Abroad, and <HI>London</HI> would not be supplyed but upon dear Rates.</P>
<P>These Arguments prevailed with the Committee as to Oats, but there being a very Gainful Trade carried on from <HI>Scotland</HI> to <HI>Norway</HI> for Oat-Meal, which it was worth while to encourage, as a Trade that Generally brought into <HI>Scotland</HI> a great deal of Bullion, and Money in <HI>specie,</HI> the Committee thought fit to place a Bounty upon the Exportation of the Oat-Meal, as <HI>per</HI> the Vote, and the state of the Time when the said Bounty should be paid being fix'd, when Oats shall be no higher than Fifteen Shillings <HI>per</HI> Quarter, there could be no danger, that the greatness of the Export should Influence the Market at <HI>London,</HI> so as to make Oats Scarce or Dear, since after they came to Fifteen Shillings <HI>per</HI> Quarter, no Boun∣ty Money could be demanded.</P>
<P>This was founded upon so just a Calculation of Equalities in Trade, that it met with no Opposition in the Parliament.</P>

<P>Thereafter a Proposal given in for a further Addition to the Sixth Article, in these Terms, <HI>viz. And that there be likewise a</HI> Proemium <HI>allowed for the Exportation of Oats proportionally with the Meal, Compt∣ing Three Bolls of Oats to one Quarter of Meal;</HI> so that the <HI>Proemium</HI> may be Ten Shilling <HI>Scots</HI> for every Boll of Oats Exported.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="403"/>
Which being read, after debate thereupon, it was put to the Vote, <HI>Allow a</HI> Proemium <HI>on the Exportation of Oats,</HI> or <HI>not?</HI> and it carried <HI>not.</HI></P>
<P>Then a second Report of the Committer, to whom the Sixth Article is remitted, was brought in, and read in these Terms; <HI>The Committee of Parliament appointed for considering the Sixth Article of the Treaty of Ʋnion, and Proposals made in Parliament relative thereto; Having Considered the Clause under written, are of Opinion, That it should be added to the Articles of Ʋnion as follows; And in respect the Importation of Victual into</HI> Scotland <HI>from any place beyond Sea would prove a Discouragement to Tillage; Therefore, That the Pro∣hibition, as now in Force by the Law of</HI> Scotland, <HI>against Importation of Victual from</HI> Ireland, <HI>or any other place beyond Sea into</HI> Scotland, <HI>do, after the Ʋnion, remain in the same Force, as now it is.</HI></P>
<P>And after some Reasoning, it was proposed to add to the above Report the subsequent Clause, <HI>viz. Ʋntil more proper and effectual ways be provided by the Parliament of</HI> Great-Britain, <HI>for discouraging the Importation of the said Victual from beyond Sea:</HI> And after some further Reasoning, the said second Report was agreed to, And it was put to the Vote, <HI>Add the above Clause to the said Report,</HI> or <HI>not,</HI> and it carried <HI>Add.</HI></P>
<P>Thereafter an Overture for an Act for Additional <HI>Proemiums</HI> on Exportation of Victual, to commence the first of <HI>February,</HI> and to end the last of <HI>April</HI> both next to come <HI>inclusive,</HI> given in and read; And agreed, That the same be taken into Consideration immediate∣ly after the Reports relating to the Sixth Article of Union.</P>
<P>Then a Third Report brought in from the said Committee was read in these Terms; <HI>The Committee of Parliament appointed for considering the Sixth Article of the Treaty of Union, and Proposals made in Parliament relative thereto; Having considered the Clause mentioned in the Twenty Seventh Days Minutes, anent the Making and Exporting of Plaiding, Fingrams, Galloway-whites, Sarges, Stockings, and all sorts of Linen to</HI> England, <HI>Dominions and Planta∣tions thereof, or any part beyond Sea, free of any Duty or Imposition; and having considered the</HI> English <HI>Acts of Parliament relative there∣unto, particularly the</HI> 32 Act primo Gulielmi &amp; Mariae, <HI>and the Twenty</HI> Act Gul. undecimo &amp; duodecimo, <HI>in regard there appears to be no Restraint at present; regulating the way and manner of mak∣ing</HI> English <HI>Woollen Cloaths and others to be Exported, and that all the Woollen Manufactures are declared to be free of Duty and Impo∣sition whatsoever at Exporting, and that, by the said Sixth Article of the Treaty of Union; all parts of the United Kingdom are to have the same Allowances and Encouragements; Therefore the Committee are of Opinion, That the adding the foresaid Clause to the Articles of Treaty is unnecessary.</HI></P>
<P>And after Debate the Vote was put, <HI>Approve of the said Third Re∣port,</HI> or <HI>not;</HI> and it carried <HI>Approve.</HI></P>
<P>Thereafter a Fourth Report was brought in from the said Commit∣tee, and read in these Terms, <HI>viz. The Committee, to whom the</HI>

<HI>Consideration of the Sixth Article of Union, and Proposals made in Parliament relative thereto, are Remitted; Having considered that Clause mentioned in the Twenty Seventh Days Minutes; That, af∣ter the Union, all sorts of</HI> Scots <HI>Linen, or any kind of Cloath made of Flax or Hemp, be Exported out of the United Kingdom free of all Customs or Impositions whatsoever;</HI> After full Reasoning on the said Clause, the Committee are of Opinion. <HI>That the adding of the said Clause to the Articles of the Treaty of Union is unnecessary, the</HI> English <HI>Duty on Linen being only Sixpence</HI> Sterling <HI>on the Fourty</HI> English <HI>Elns.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Adjourned till to Morrow at Ten of the Clock.</HI></P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATION XXXVI.</HEAD>
<P>Notwithstanding what was argued in the Committeee, which I have noted above, and at which I was present, having had the Occasion to make several of these Calculations for the Service of the said Committee: Some Gentlemen in the Par∣liament insisted upon the allowing a Drawback or Bounty Money upon Exportation <HI>of Oats;</HI> but when the same Rea∣sons mentioned above, which had been argued in the Com∣mittee, came to be offered in full Parliament, it was so con∣vincing, that they soon acquiesc'd, and so it was carryed without, as <HI>per</HI> the Minute.</P>
<P>The subsequent Reports of the Committee mentioned in this Days Minutes, seemed only to add the Authority of the Committees Examinations to what had before been offered in Publick, <HI>viz.</HI> That, after the Union, the Exportation of Linen and Woollen Manufactures would be free, and the se∣veral Manufactures be under no Restraint or Regulations, but that either in Transporting them to <HI>England,</HI> or Exporting them to Foreign Parts, all was open and free by the Union.</P>
<P>And this Report of the Committee was a full Proof of what I have all along alledged, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Common People of <HI>Scotland</HI> were intolerably imposed upon, in the Accounts spread abroad relating especially to Trade, and in this in par∣ticular, <HI>viz.</HI> That the <HI>Scots</HI> Woollen and Linen Manufacture would be subjected to several Restrictions and Regulations in <HI>England,</HI> which could not be complyed with.</P>
<P>This was grounded upon an Office in <HI>England,</HI> granted by Patent some Years since, which was called the Aulnage, which amounted to no more, than putting a Seal and demanding a Fee upon every parcel of Woollen Manufactures brought to <HI>London,</HI> under pretence of Viewing if they were Marketable—; But this Duty or Fee being a very small Trifle, and the Power of Inspecting found deficient, it was of no Force at all, and therefore, upon the Committees Examining this, they saw no Ground of Objection.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="405"/>
The next Objection was about Exportation, and here it is observable, That the Opposers of the Union had not only suggested, but openly printed, and exposed about the Streets such Absurdities as these, That the <HI>Scots</HI> Linen would not be admitted into <HI>England,</HI> but a great Duty would be laid upon it to gratifie the <HI>Dutch;</HI> That great Duties were to be paid upon both Linen and Woollen Manufactures on their Exportation, and the like. Now it was very happy, that these things came to be Considered and Examined by a Committee.</P>
<P> For now it was evident,<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That no Duty could be laid on the Transporting any Linen or Woollen Goods from <HI>Scotland</HI> to <HI>England,</HI> which were the Growth or Manufacture of <HI>Scotland,</HI> the Article of Communication of Trade having effectually taken off all Impositions between the Counties or Shires of all <HI>Great-Britain</HI> equally to all.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. As to the Duty on Woollen Goods, there never was any Duty paid Outward, but what was called the Old Subsidy of Tonnage and Poundage, which was Five <HI>per Cent.</HI> which had been effectually taken off, &amp; that Act Repealed in the Act of Parliament mentioned in the Re∣port, and no Duty at all was paid on any Woollen Ma∣nufacture whatever Exported out of <HI>England,</HI> and by Consequence could not be out of <HI>Scotland.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>3. All Linen Cloth was so free, That the Duty on Cloth Imported to <HI>England</HI> from Foreign Parts, was all drawn back by Certificate on the Exporting it again, in order to encourage the said Exportation, and for Linen Exported made in <HI>Britain,</HI> it was so small a Trifle paid, <HI>viz.</HI> Sixpence on Fourty Ells, that it was not worth notice.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>This Report of the Committee put a great Stop to the Cla∣mours, that had been so loud upon the Article of Trade; and when this Vote was made publick, the People began to see they were imposed upon, and that these things in <HI>Eng∣land</HI> were misrepresented.</P>

<P>A Sixth Report brought in from the said Committee was Read in these Terms, <Q REND="inline">"The Committee are also of Opinion, That there be a Clause added to the Articles of Union in these Terms, <HI>viz.</HI> That from and after the Union, no <HI>Scots</HI> Cattle carried into <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> shall be lyable to any other Duties, either on the publick or private Accounts, than these Duties to which the Cattle of <HI>Eng∣land</HI> are or shall be lyable, within the said Kingdom.</Q></P>

<P>And after Reasoning a state of a Vote was offered, <Q REND="inline">"Approve of the said seventh Report of the Committee as to all except Mort Lambs Skins, and Remit to the said Committee to receive Over∣tures for Encouragement of Wooll Masters and Woollen Manu∣factures <HI>Yea</HI> or <HI>Not.</HI></Q></P>

And thereafter a Resolve was offered in these Terms, Resolved, 'That there shall be an Encouragement provided to the Heretors of Wool Countries, in case the Report of the Committee <HI>anent the Exportation of Wooll</HI> &amp;c. be Approven.</P>
<P>And after some Reasoning, a Proposal was given in for adding a Clause in these Terms; <Q REND="inline">"And for Remeiding the loss Wooll masters may suffer, and for Encouraging the Manufacturing of Tarr'd Wooll within the Kingdom, and to prevent effectually the Expor∣ting thereof, It is provided and declared, That for the space of seven years after the Union, when the Tarr'd Wooll within the Shires of <HI>Roxburgh, Selkirk</HI> and <HI>Tweeddale,</HI> is at four pound <HI>Scots</HI> or under for the stone Weight, Fifteen shilling <HI>Scots,</HI> shall be payed of <HI>Proemium</HI> for every stone Weight of Tarr'd Wooll, to every Wooll-master, who within a Moneth after the said Tarr'd Wooll is Clipped or Shorn off the Sheep, shall by his own Oath or the Oaths of two habile Witnesses, before any Judge Ordinar, make appear that the Number of Stones of Tarr'd Wooll specified in the said Oaths were truly and really Clipt and Shorn from Sheep in <HI>Scot∣land,</HI> properly belonging to the Persons mentioned in the said Oaths; and which <HI>Proemium</HI> shall be payed the next Collector of Cess, Excises or Customs, upon delivering to them the foresaid Depositions Signed by the Deponents, and Judge foresaid, with a Receipt of the Money, and the said Collectors and each of them shall be personally lyable for the said <HI>Proemium,</HI> upon Instruments taken against them in case of Refusal, and the foresaid Depositi∣ons and Receipts shall be allowed to the said Collectors as an Ex∣oneration in their Accompts <HI>pro tanto.</HI></Q></P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATION XXXVII.</HEAD>
<P>There was a Clause in the Treaty for the reserving all pri∣vate Rights, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as <HI>per</HI> the 20<HI>th</HI> Article; Now some of these private Rights amounted to Exemption from certain Customs &amp; Excises, as particular Privileges to this or that Place or Person, as at <HI>Glasgow</HI> for Encouragement of their Sugar-works, they are Ex∣empted from paying any Excise for the Spirits they Distill from the Melasses, Bottoms, Scummings, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and so in several Towns they were Exempted from such and such Cu∣stoms—; These were of necessity to be Exempted, because by another Article as above, private Rights on both sides were to be preserved.</P>
<P>Now, as this was for <HI>Scotland</HI> on one hand, so it was for <HI>England</HI> on another, for the City of <HI>Carlisle</HI> and the Family of Sir <HI>Christopher Musgrave</HI> had an ancient Right of taking Toll of all the Cattel which passed from <HI>Scotland</HI> to <HI>England,</HI> over such Passes or Bridges as they had the Lordship of, and these by private Rights were actually reserved.</P>
<P>But the Committee having demanded here the taking away the Toll, <HI>payed as above,</HI> the private Right on the <HI>English</HI> side ceased; So that what seem'd solid and confirm'd by the Uni∣on in one part, was yet Invaded and taken away by ano∣ther—. But to Reconcile this Matter, the Parliament of <HI>England</HI> Interposed, and when some People thought they had now brought their Affair to a Head, and that now the Trea∣ty must break, behold, a <HI>Medium</HI> was found out in <HI>England, viz.</HI> That the Parliament in <HI>England</HI> Bought these private Rights of the City of <HI>Carlisle</HI> and of the Family of Sir <HI>Chri∣stopher Musgrave,</HI> and giving them an Equivalent for them, they Acquiesced, and all ways were laid open for all manner of <HI>Scots</HI> or <HI>English</HI> Goods to Pass and Repass without any Toll, Stoppage, or Interruption, whether Cattle or Corn, or any other kind of Goods except such as (<HI>Scotland</HI> being Ex∣empted from the Taxes of in this Treaty for a Time,) were not to be carried into <HI>England</HI> during that Limited Time, or if they were carried in, were lyable to the <HI>English</HI> Duties as soon as they came into <HI>England,</HI> such as Salt, Coals, Malt, Fish Cur'd with <HI>Scots</HI> Salt, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> As is more particularly Explained hereafter.</P>
<P>Thus the private Rights in <HI>Scotland</HI> were preserved intire, according to the Treaty, and in <HI>England</HI> also, for if they were Invaded by the Treaty, the Subject had such satisfaction gi∣ven him in Money, as that he appeared willing to Resign those Rights—, as the City of <HI>Carlisle</HI> for instance, who, I think, had Two Thousand Five Hundred Pound <HI>Sterling</HI> given them, for parting with the Right of Toll upon <HI>Scots</HI> Cattle, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

In this exact Equality, the Sixth Report of the Commit∣tee about <HI>Scots</HI> Cattle, became as it were settled; but it was Objected, That the Parliament might hereafter lay on a par∣ticular Tax upon the <HI>Scots</HI> Cattle passing into <HI>England,</HI> either in Favours of the <HI>Irish</HI> Cattle, or upon any other subsequent Oc∣casion which could not be foreseen; And therefore, the send∣ing Lean Cattle from <HI>Scotland</HI> into <HI>England,</HI> being such a considerable Article to <HI>Scotland,</HI> and on which the Estates of the Northern Gentry did almost wholly depend, all their Rents being paid them in Cattle, for which they had no other Vent or Market but their being sent into <HI>England,</HI> and that any Tax or Toll being hereafter laid on them, might intire∣ly put a stop to it, and consequently Impair, and almost Ruine the Estates of the Gentry and Nobility of <HI>Scotland;</HI> On this Consideration, it was thought fit by the Committee, to secure <HI>Scotland</HI> effectually from so much as a Jealousie or Uneasiness about it, by making it a Part of the Union, That <HI>From and after the Ʋnion, no</HI> Scots <HI>Cattle carried into</HI> England <HI>shall be liable to any other Duties either publick or private than the Cattle of</HI> England. This was again an Article of Equality, for the Case was, not to Exempt the <HI>Scots</HI> Cattle intirely from any Tax, which the United Parliament might think fit to lay on Cattle in General, if ever the Article of General Ex∣cises so much talk'd of in <HI>England,</HI> should be offered at; but to bring the <HI>Scots</HI> Cattle upon a Level with all the rest of the Cattle in <HI>England;</HI> and to provide that <HI>Scots</HI> Cattle, <HI>Qua</HI> Scots <HI>Cattle,</HI> should be under no particular National Disad∣vantage—; And this was thought Reasonable on every side.</P>
<P>The Seventh Report of the Committee requires some Ex∣plication on several Accounts—, It was true, and no Que∣stion was to be made of it, That <HI>Scotland</HI> having then an open Trade with <HI>France</HI> without Restriction, and that their Wooll was under no Prohibition at all, but freely Exported to <HI>France,</HI> or any other Part of the World, and that this Li∣berty being by the Union to be absolutely and intirely Re∣strained, the Prices of Wooll in <HI>Scotland</HI> would of course very much Fall, and the Gentlemen of the South and West Parts of <HI>Scotland,</HI> such as in <HI>Roxburgh</HI> Shire, <HI>Selkirk, Tweed∣dale,</HI> and <HI>Galloway,</HI> whose Estates very much consisted in the Product of their Sheep, would receive a very sensible Blow by it; Tho' it was remarkable that some People was for gi∣ving all <HI>Britain</HI> a worse Blow, to prevent the Injury done to those Countries, <HI>viz.</HI> To allow Exporting the Wooll, and some Warm Debates were upon this Head.</P>
<P>To Explain this, it was to be Enquired into, under what kind of Influence, and by whose Management the Trade of <HI>Scotland</HI> was at first laid open, and the Exporting of Wooll permitted in General; This as it produc'd no Effect, but the ripping up old Sores, and reviving Personal and Party Re∣flections,
<PB N="123" REF="410"/>
I shall let Fall. But this was certain, That whoever were the the Occasion of it, the Shipping off the Wooll from <HI>Scotland,</HI> was very Injurious to the publick Advantage of <HI>Scotland,</HI> a Mortal Wound given to the Industry of the Peo∣ple, discouraging all Attempts of Manufacturing among them, which they were now coming into, and which their Neigh∣bours of <HI>England</HI> had so much been Enriched by: It was ap∣parent, That the small Exportation they formerly had of coarse Woollen Manufactures to <HI>Swedeland</HI> and the <HI>Baltick,</HI> was now almost brought to a full Stop, and the <HI>Swedes</HI> on the con∣trary took their Wooll from <HI>Scotland,</HI> which they had not been used to do, by which it was apparent, they having the Wooll, made the Manufactures themselves, and this was a dead Loss to <HI>Scotland,</HI> just so much as the Employment and Labour of their Poor amounted to.</P>
<P>From this part of National ill Husbandry, no Body could be supposed to receive any Benefit, except the Exporter and the Wooll Master, so they call the Gentlemen of <HI>Galloway, Roxburgh</HI> Shire, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> whose Estates are very much depend∣ing upon Sheep.</P>
<P>This being the Occasion of the Rising the Prices of their Wooll, and their Advantage being thus begun in the Error and Injury of their Country, it seemed to be no National Affair to make good the Loss that was supposed now to hap∣pen by the Union; which was indeed but reducing Things to where they were before, and taking away that Advantage, which, if the Eyes of their Representatives in former Par∣liaments had been open, they had never had, and which it was the great Loss of the whole Kingdom, that they ever had at all.</P>
<P>However the Parliament, who, going upon the great Scheme of Equalities so often mentioned, appeared willing to make all People easy; were ready and forward enough to have an Allowance by way of Equivalent given to the Gentlemen that were Sheep Masters, and who should be pinched by the falling of the price of their Wooll; but then it was debated, in what manner that Equivalent should be given, for, to give to particular Persons such and such a Sum of Money, would seem partial, and be short of the Design; as it would be some Personal Satisfaction indeed, but no National Satisfaction: The Money given therefore ought to be for the Publick Good; and this could be by no Method so exactly stated to the Circumstance, as by appropriating the Money to such Gentlemen, who being Wooll Masters, would apply that Money to the Manufacturing that Wooll in their own Country; thereby both encreasing the Consump∣tion of the Wooll, and setting the Poor of their respective Countries to Work—; This Scheme had too much Equi∣ty in it, and too much of the Publick Good in it to be dis∣liked,
<PB N="124" REF="411"/>
nor did those that opposed it pretend to object much against the Reasonableness of it, but still it was opposed, and the Reasons for which it was opposed were manifest.</P>
<P>The Party, who, as I have all along noted, sought some Occasion or other to break off the Treaty, had now this Me∣thod only left, <HI>viz.</HI> To clog the Affair with such Amendments or Alterations, which they knew <HI>England</HI> either would not or could not grant—; Nor did they stick in Conversati∣on honestly to owne, That they did not dislike the Reasons of several Things that they opposed, were they consenting to the Union in general, but they were <HI>against the ƲNION,</HI> and therefore they were obliged to oppose the Particulars, in order to oppose the General.</P>
<P>These Gentlemen therefore very warmly argued for a Free∣dom of Exportation of Wooll, and for having it made a Clause in the Articles; which, if they had gain'd, they easily fore∣saw the Union must split upon that Rock, for that <HI>England,</HI> who have made it Felony, and always prohibited the Export of their Wooll under the greatest Penalties, neither would or indeed could come into it.</P>
<P>It was urged, this Liberty of Exporting Wooll might be restrained to <HI>Scotland</HI> only; That it was absolutely necessary to <HI>Scotland,</HI> for that they could not Manufacture all their Wooll in their own Country; That their Wool was Coarse, and did not injure the <HI>English</HI> Trade, since all their Manu∣factures were of Fine Wooll; That, if <HI>Scotland</HI> could not Manufacture their Wooll, nor should be suffered to Export it, the Wooll would be of no Use, but must perish, and be good for nothing; That the Manufactures now set up in <HI>Scot∣land,</HI> being chiefly Fine Goods, were generally made of <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> Wooll, and after the Union, the Wooll from <HI>England</HI> be∣ing generally brought in thither, the Wooll of <HI>Scotland</HI> would be of no manner of Value.</P>
<P>But these Arguments were Answered thus, That, to allow the Exportation of Wooll from <HI>Scotland</HI> only, would oblige the Government to keep still on the Borders, an Army of Offi∣cers, to Search and Examine the Passage of all Goods passing between the Kingdoms, and keep up that Distinction of King∣doms, which, as to Trade, as well as Government, was to be wholly taken away by the Union—; That, after all, it would be impossible to prevent the carrying of Wooll into <HI>Scotland,</HI> and consequently the Exportation of <HI>English</HI> Wooll with, or instead of <HI>Scots</HI> Wooll.</P>
<P>In the next place, this would oblige the Government of <HI>Britain</HI> to a strict Prohibition of the bringing any <HI>English</HI> Wooll into <HI>Scotland</HI> after the Union, lest the same should be Exported, which, after its being in <HI>Scotland,</HI> could not be so distinguish'd as to be prevented; and that this Prohibition would Rob <HI>Scotland</HI> of all that Advantage which it is propo∣sed
<PB N="125" REF="412"/>
she shall enjoy after the Union, by her People being im∣ployed in the Manufacturing of <HI>English</HI> Wooll.</P>
<P>Again, That this would destroy all Freedom of Commerce and Communication of Trade between the Kingdoms, that all Vessels to and from <HI>Scotland</HI> must be Visited and Searched equally with Strangers, and the Face of an Union be ruffled with continued Jealousies of, and Watchings against Clande∣stine Trade.</P>
<P>Lastly, That it was inconsistent with the Publick Good of <HI>Scotland</HI> in its Proportion, as much as of <HI>England,</HI> and that it would effectually destroy the Hopes of <HI>Scotlands</HI> Encreasing in Manufactures, and Encouraging her Trade by the Imploy∣ment of her Poor.</P>
<P>As to the Consumption, it was urged, That <HI>England</HI> was always a Market for Wooll, where it might be sold without fail, at some Price or other; and if the Price was low just then, that was but a common Calamity the Effect of the long War with <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> in which they had still a Share with their Neighbours, but that the Wooll of <HI>Scotland</HI> would always sell as well as the Wooll of <HI>England,</HI> in Proportion to its Fineness; And this led of Course to the first Propo∣sal, That what Encouragement was possible to be given to the Wooll Masters by the Treaty, should be given them on the Conditions of setting the Poor to Work in their res∣pective Countries, which, in that Case, would have this double Advantage, 1. The Employment and Subsistence of the Poor; and, 2. The Consumption of the Wooll at Home, which directly took off the pretended Necessity of Exporting it to other Countries, for want of a Vent of it at Home, or their sending it to <HI>England</HI> to be sold, as they cal∣led it, for little or nothing: How well this Money was paid after the Union, or when paid, how well applyed to the Common Good of <HI>Scotland,</HI> is none of my Business here to enquire.</P>
<P>I have been the longer in stating this Case, because it has been often objected to the <HI>Scots</HI> Members of Parlia∣ment, That they were too Forward to comply with the Prohibition of Wooll, and that their Country lost a great Advantage by it.</P>
<P>There was a pretended Expedient then offered, about the manner of Disposing the Equivalent to such Persons, as had such or such certain Quantities of Tarr'd Wooll; but the Reasonableness of the above Proposal prevailed against any other, and therefore it needs not be enquir∣ed into.</P>

<P>A Scurrilous Print asserting the Dependency of the Crown and Kingdom of <HI>Scotland</HI> upon the Crown and Kingdom of <HI>England</HI> brought in, and several Paragraphs thereof being read,</P>
<P><HI>Ordered,</HI> That the said Scurrilous Print be Burned by the Hand of the common Hangman, at the Mercat Cross of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> to Mor∣row, betwixt Eleven and Twelve of the Clock, and the Magistrates of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> appointed to see the same punctually done.</P>
<P>An Eighth Report from the Committee, to whom the Sixth Ar∣ticle of Union was Remitted, brought in and read in these Terms, <HI>viz. The Committee of Parliament, to whom the Sixth Article of the Treaty was Remitted, having Considered the Remit to them, with the Books of Rates both for</HI> Scotland <HI>and</HI> England, <HI>and the several Acts of Parliament relating thereto, the Schemes or Abstracts from the Custom-House Books given in to them from the Council of Trade, and the Report thereanent of their Sub-Committee, who, on a Report from them, had compar∣ed the Customs and Duties on Export and Import settled in</HI> England <HI>with these settled in</HI> Scotland, <HI>and had calculated the Duties payable in</HI> Scot∣land <HI>upon Tarr, Tobacco, Iron, Dails, single and double Trees, Lint and Lintseed, and compared the same with the Duties payable upon the same Goods in</HI> England, <HI>at a</HI> Medium <HI>of the Three Years, whereof they had the said Abstracts from the Custom-House Books:</HI> They find, <HI>That, as to the Customs and Duties on Export and Import in general, the Cu∣stoms in</HI> Scotland <HI>belong to the Crown, and are perpetual, whereas those in</HI> England <HI>terminate at a certain Number of Years,</HI> viz. <HI>About Two Fifteen Parts thereof at</HI> 8th March 1709 <HI>Years, Nine Fifteen Parts thereof at</HI> 1st. August 1710, <HI>about Three Fifteen Parts thereof continue only during Her Majesties Life, and about One Fifteen Part thereof for Ninety Five Years; And that the Duties upon Exportation, which were granted</HI> 12<SUP>o</SUP> Car. 2. Cap. 4. <HI>are easie, have never been augmented, save upon a very few particulars, and terminate the first of</HI> August 1710; <HI>That these Goods which contribute to Luxury, and those that are Manu∣factured, or can be had within the Island, are those that pay high Duties when Imported, but that the whole, or most of the Customs and Duties paid at Importation, are drawn back upon Exportation, if Exported within a certain time, except a Moiety of Old Subsidy which is very small, and which is Imposed by the foresaid Act</HI> 12<SUP>o</SUP> Car. 2. Cap. 4. <HI>and termi∣nates the first of</HI> August 1710; <HI>That the Duties upon the before-men∣tioned Goods, at the above</HI> Medium <HI>payable in</HI> Scotland, <HI>by the nearest</HI>
<PB N="127" REF="414"/>
<HI>Calculation can be made, amounts to</HI> 253184 l. 15 sh. 7 d. <HI>and now payable in</HI> England <HI>to</HI> 413559 l. 8 sh. 4 d. <HI>and payable in</HI> England <HI>af∣ter</HI> 1710 <HI>to</HI> 129640 l. 9 sh. 8 d.

<P>And after some Reasoning thereon a state of a Vote was offered, <HI>Approve of the Sixth Article of Ʋnion as Explained and Enlarged, or Not.</HI></P>
<P>But it being moved, That the Vote could not be stated in these Terms, in respect what concerned the <HI>African</HI> Company fell under the said Sixth Article, which was to be considered.</P>
<P>Whereupon it was agreed, That what concerns the <HI>African</HI> Com∣pany shall be intire, and be taken into Consideration under the Fifteenth Article, and that the Approving of the Sixth Article shall not be prejudicial thereto.</P>
<P>And the above state for a Vote being again proposed, after some Debate, it was moved, That the said Article should be further Amended; And thereupon a second state of a Vote was offered in these Terms, <HI>Approve or Amend.</HI></P>
<P>Whereupon the said sixth Article, with the several Additions, En∣largements and Explanations after-mentioned contained in several former Minutes, <HI>viz. The Word</HI> Drawback <HI>to be insert in both Clauses of the said</HI> Article. Item, <HI>And seing by the Laws of</HI> Eng∣land, <HI>notwithstanding there are Rewards granted upon Exportation of certain kinds of Grain, wherein Oats Grinded or Ungrinded, are not specified, that from and after the Union, when Oats shall be at Fif∣teen Shillings</HI> Sterling per <HI>Quarter, or under, there shall be paid Two Shillings and Six Pence</HI> Sterling <HI>for every Quarter of the Oat Meal Exported in the Terms of the Law, whereby, and so long as Rewards are granted for Exportation of other Grains, and that the Bear of</HI> Scotland <HI>have the same Rewards as Barley.</HI> Item, <HI>And in respect the Importation of Victual into</HI> Scotland <HI>from any part beyond Sea, would prove a Discouragement to Tillage, Therefore, That the Prohibitions as now in force by the Law of</HI> Scotland <HI>against Importation of Victual from</HI> Ireland, <HI>or any other place beyond Sea into</HI> Scotland, <HI>do after the Union remain in the same force as now it is, until more proper and effectual ways be provided by the Parlia∣ment of</HI> Great-Britain, <HI>for discouraging the Importation of the said Victual from beyond Sea.</HI> Item, <HI>Excepting and reserving the Duties upon Export and Import of such particular Commodities, from which any Persons, the Subjects of either Kingdom, are specially liberated and exempted by their private Rights, which, after the Union, are to remain safe and intire to them in all respects as before the same.</HI> Item, <HI>That, from and after the Union, no</HI> Scots <HI>Cattel carried into</HI>
<PB N="128" REF="415"/>
England, <HI>shall be lyable to any other Duties, either on the publick or private Accounts than these Duties, to which the Cattel of</HI> England <HI>are, or shall be lyable within the said Kingdom,</HI> being all read over, it was put to the Vote, whether the first or second should be the state of the Vote, and it carried, <HI>First.</HI></P>
<P>Then the Vote was put, <HI>Approve of the said sixth Article En∣larged and Explained, or not;</HI> And it carried <HI>Approve.</HI></P>
<P>Draught of an Act for Additional <HI>Proemiums</HI> on Exportation of Victual, to commence the first of <HI>February,</HI> and to end the last of <HI>April</HI> both next to come, again read, and a first reading ordered to be marked thereon.</P>
<P>The Eighth Article of Union read, and the first Clause or Para∣graph thereof was also again read.</P>
<P>Whereupon a Report brought in from the Committee, to whom the said Eighth Article is remitted, was read in these Terms, <HI>The Committee, to whom the Eighth Article of Ʋnion anent Duties upon Salt was remitted, are of Opinion, That, after the first Clause of the said Article, an Explanation in the Terms following will be necessary.</HI></P>
<P><HI>But, in regard the Duties of great Quantities of Foreign Salt Im∣ported may be very heavy upon the Merchants Importers; That there∣fore all Foreign Salt Imported shall be Cellar'd and Lock'd up under the Custody of the Merchant Importer, and Officers imployed for Levying the Duties upon Salt; And that the Merchant may have what Quantities thereof his Occasion may require, Not under a Wey, or Fourty Bushel at a time, giving security for the Duty of what Quantity he receives, pay∣able in six Months.</HI></P>
<P>And after some Reasoning thereon, the further Consideration of the said Eighth Article and Report was delayed till the next <HI>Sede∣runt</HI> of Parliament.</P>
<P><HI>Adjourned till to Morrow at Ten of the Clock.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="38" TYPE="observation">
<HEAD>OBSERVATION XXXVIII.</HEAD>
<P>The long Report of the Committee, on this Point of the Customs is very distinct, but may require some Explanation, and in order to that, it is necessary to enter into the short History of the Reason of this Calculation.</P>
<P>Two great Complaints ran through the whole Nation up∣on the Subject of Taxes and Trade, 1. That the <HI>English</HI> clog'd the Trade of <HI>Scotland</HI> with Intolerable Burdens: And 2. That they raised their Customs, and would Gain great Sums of Money from <HI>Scotland</HI> by doing so; <HI>For the</HI> Scots <HI>had no Notion of the Equivalent, nor would they for along time after this, entertain any Notion of it.</HI></P>
<P>In order to clear up the Objections of the People against the Customs, the particular Heads were referred to this Com∣mittee to Examine.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="416"/>
The first, were the Duties on Import, which the Com∣mittee observed very well in <HI>England,</HI> is always laid highest on such Goods as contribute to Luxury, or are Manufactured within the Island, the first Esteem'd less necessary, such as Wine, Brandy, Foreign Linen, Fruit, Druggs, East <HI>India</HI> Goods, Coffee, Tea, Sugars, Tobacco, Deals, Timber, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Things we might live without, or might supply in part at Home; or being willing to have, and being Generally used by the Richer sort of People, the payments are less felt. The second, For the Encouragement of our own Poor, who ought upon all occasions to be Employed; and if any thing which comes from Abroad can be made at Home, that Home∣part ought to be Encouraged, by laying high Duties and Imposts, or perhaps Prohibitions on the like from Abroad, such are the Prohibitions of or high Duties, on wrought Silks, Woollen Manufactures, Bone Lace, Brasil Sugar, wrought Iron, Hats, Glass, Printed Callicoes, Pantiles, Earthen Ware, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>It was now Objected in <HI>Scotland,</HI> That the Customs there would be very grievous, that the <HI>English</HI> Duties on Tar, Tobacco, Iron, Deals, and Timber, Lint and Lint-Seed, would be Intolerable to the Poor, and raise the Customs of <HI>Scotland</HI> to a very great Height.</P>
<P>The Committee Examined the Proportions of Things, and setting the whole upon an Equality, produc'd a very well grounded Conclusion, That the Customs of <HI>Scotland</HI> would be less to be paid after the Union than before; and it gave great satisfaction at that time, to those People who were capable of receiving Impressions from just Calculations, when the Calculations of this Committee really stated the Ballance of Trade, for that was easie to Draw out of these Calculations: It had been offered in the Parliament, (with how little Foun∣dation, or how much Assurance, I shall not determine); (1.) That <HI>Scotland</HI> got nothing by the <HI>English</HI> Trade. (2.) That <HI>Scotland</HI> were considerable Gainers by the <HI>French</HI> Trade.</P>
<P>I shall not Censure the People that offered this, as Aim∣ing at a <HI>French</HI> Union, not an <HI>English;</HI> for they did not stick to owne that, but it is not to the purpose here—; I shall only consider the State of the Trade of either King∣dom, as it stood at this Time, and as it was stated to the Parliament.</P>
<P>The Trade to <HI>France</HI> stood thus,<LIST>
<ITEM>Exported to <HI>France</HI> from <HI>Scot∣land,</HI> <LIST>
<ITEM>Wooll, Leather, Lead, and Fish.</ITEM>
</LIST></ITEM>
<ITEM>Imported from <HI>France</HI> to <HI>Scotland,</HI> <LIST>
<ITEM>Wine, Brandy, wrought Silks, Hats, Glass, Cork, Rosin, Fruit, and Toys.</ITEM>
</LIST></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="417"/>
The several Quantities of these, however Uncertain, as the Trade Increased or Decreased, had nevertheless this Ge∣neral Proportion, That the Wine and Brandy Imported into <HI>Scotland,</HI> did over and above Ballance all the Export out of <HI>Scotland</HI> to <HI>France,</HI> by above one half Part, the Consequence of which, was, That the <HI>French</HI> Trade must draw away ready Money from <HI>Scotland</HI> for the other Half, besides all the other Imports from thence, over and above this Considera∣tion, That all the Import from <HI>France,</HI> was meer Luxury and unnecessary Consumption.</P>
<P>As to the state of the Trade between <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>England,</HI> it stood Thus,
<LIST>
<ITEM>Imports to <HI>Scotland</HI> from <HI>England,</HI>

<ITEM>Cattel of all sorts 57078.</ITEM>

</LIST></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P><HI>Note,</HI> The Tobaccos and Sugars after the Union may, and 'tis not questioned, will be Imported into <HI>Scotland</HI> from the <HI>British</HI> Plantations, in Return for the Growth and Pro∣duce of their own Countrey; So that the whole Trade to <HI>England</HI> after the Union, would turn to the Interest and Ad∣vantage of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>Nor can I omit to add the Experiment of this, to prove, That these Calculations were not Suppositions and Remote, since in the very first year after the Union, these Consequen∣ces in Trade visibly appeared, and which of my own cer∣tain Knowledge, I can take the Freedom to Advance.<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That on the falling of the <HI>English</HI> Duty on <HI>Scots</HI> Linen, the Demand was so great for <HI>Scots</HI> Linen for the <HI>English</HI> Markets, that it not only swept all the Linen away, so that Two Months before the usual Time, the whole Quantity was gone, and the <HI>English</HI> Merchants could get no Linen for Money; but the whole Manu∣facture
<PB N="131" REF="418"/>
of Linen, advanced at least Two Pence an Ell upon the finer <HI>Scots</HI> Linen, and One Penny <HI>per</HI> Ell on the coarser sorts, which was a great Sum in the whole.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. In the very first year after the Union, <HI>Scotland</HI> Shipt away for <HI>England,</HI> besides several Ships Loaden for <HI>Portugal</HI> and other Foreign parts, above 140000 Boll of Corn, above 40000 Boll of which was carried out of the two small Counties of <HI>Merss</HI> or <HI>Berwick</HI> Shire and <HI>Tiviotdale,</HI> 20000 Boll and more out of the single County of <HI>Fife,</HI> and the rest from the Shires adjoyning to the Firth, and some parts from the North.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. In the first year after the Union, the <HI>Scots</HI> fitted out several Ships, I think Seven or Eight, to the <HI>English</HI> Plantations, Fraighted with their own Produce, the Re∣turn of which being in Tobacco or Sugars, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> have this Advantage to <HI>Scotland,</HI> That <HI>First,</HI> The said To∣bacco and Sugars supply their own Consumption, and keep that Money at Home, which used to go to <HI>Eng∣land</HI> and <HI>Holland</HI> to purchase their Supply. And 2<HI>dly.</HI> The Overplus which they can not Expend, they Export to <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> which returns to the Advantage of the publick Stock.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. In the very first year after the Union, <HI>Scotland</HI> had Three or Four Ships Returned Home from <HI>Italy</HI> and <HI>Por∣tugal,</HI> bringing Home Wines from <HI>Leghorn</HI> and <HI>Galitia,</HI> these being the Return of Fish from <HI>Scotland,</HI> could now Return with their Fraights to their own Countrey, where before, by reason of the <HI>French</HI> Wines, they could have no Consumption, but were obliged to Load to other Ports, and come Home Empty.</ITEM>

<DIV2 N="39" TYPE="observation">
<HEAD>OBSERVATION XXXIX.</HEAD>
<P>The Report of the Committee on the first Paragraph of the Eighth Article is printed in the precedent Minute relating to the Duties on Salt—; The payment of equal Duties on Foreign Salt was not objected, but it was argued, That the <HI>Scots</HI> Merchants being poor, and being nevertheless obliged to Import large Quantities of Foreign Salt at the proper Times, which must ly by till the Season for using the same, and the Duties being now very large which were to be paid; they might not be able either to advance the Money, or find sufficient Security for the Duties, as the Law in that Case pro∣vided—; And therefore this Amendment was made for the Ease of the Merchant, which was both Reasonable to the Government, and Easy to the Merchant, and took off all pretence of Quarrel upon the Disburse of Money, or lying out of Stock.</P>
<P>The second Report upon the Eight Article was founded upon equal Reasoning: It had been agreed in <HI>England</HI> in the said Eighth Article, That all Flesh Salted in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and carryed to <HI>England,</HI> or Flesh Salted in <HI>Scotland</HI> for Victualling Ships or Exportation; should be Forfeited, if Cured with <HI>Scots</HI> Salt—; But this was counted a Hardship on several Ac∣counts, and <HI>England</HI> being allowed to Cure all sorts of Flesh with their own, whether for their own Consumption, Victual∣ling of Ships or Exportation; it ought to be also allowed to <HI>Scotland,</HI> by virtue of the Subjects enjoying equal Allowances and Restrictions, <HI>Article</HI> VI. Wherefore the Committee made this Amendment, That the <HI>Scots</HI> might Cure Flesh with their own Salt, provided all Flesh so Cured, that was either sent for <HI>England,</HI> or used in Victualling Ships, or Exported for Sale, should be charged with the Duty on Salt paid in <HI>England,</HI></P>
<P>The Third Report upon the Eighth Article concerned the Laws in Force in <HI>Scotland</HI> for Curing and Packing of Herring, White Fish and Salmond, which, by this Article, were re∣served; These Laws were the 5<HI>th. Act</HI> 3<HI>d. Session</HI> 1<HI>st. Parliament,</HI>
<PB N="134" REF="421"/>
King <HI>William</HI> &amp; Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> Appointing <HI>all Herrings</HI> &amp; <HI>Salmond for Export be Made, Pined and Cured with</HI> French <HI>Bay, or</HI> Spa∣nish <HI>Salt, or with Salt upon Salt made of Foreign Salt;</HI> The 24<HI>th. Act</HI> 7<HI>th. Session</HI> of the same Parliament, <HI>Confirming the same, and Directing the Proof of it,</HI> with a Confirmation of the 34th. <HI>Act of</HI> 2<HI>d. Session</HI> of the same Parliament, for Draw-backs on Herrings and Salmond Exported.</P>
<P>But, upon this new Treaty, respecting the <HI>English</HI> Duty on Salt, it was calculated as you see in the Minute, That the Salt commonly used in Curing a Barrel of Herring, amounted to about Nine Shillings <HI>per</HI> Barrel; And in regard of the Wasting of the Salt, Loss in carrying, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> they re∣solved to put it at Ten Shillings <HI>per</HI> Barrel, which fully An∣swered the Petition of the Fish and Salt Merchants mentioned in the same Minute.</P>

<P>Thereafter another Report brought in from the Committee, to whom the Eighth Article of Union is Remitted, was Read in these Terms, <HI>That White Herrings, Red Herring, Salmond, Dry or Bar∣relled Cod, and all Fishes Cured or Packed in order to Exportation, ought to be Cured and Packed with Foreign Salt allennarly, and that it does require Four Bolls of Foreign Salt to Cure and Pack a Last of White Her∣rings.</HI></P>
<P>And after much Debate thereupon, a Motion was made for amend∣ing that Clause of the said Eighth Article of Union mentioned in the former Days Minutes, in relation to the continuing in Force the Laws and Acts of Parliament in <HI>Scotland for Pining, Curing and Packing of Herrings, White Fish and Salmond for Exportation with Fo∣reign Salt only,</HI> by adding these Words thereto, <HI>without any Mixture of</HI> British <HI>or</HI> Irish <HI>Salt.</HI></P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATION XL.</HEAD>
<P>The Report of the Committee last day was now only Considered, with Relation to the main part of the Question, Whether their Fish should be Cured with Foreign Salt only, or not, and it was agreed, it should be so.</P>
<P>It was counted a very great Hardship, That the Fish Cured in <HI>Scotland,</HI> should not be Cured but with Foreign Salt; some People alledging, That the Salt made in <HI>Scotland</HI> would Cure the Herring as well as Foreign Salt—; But it had been found by Experience, That the Fish Cured with <HI>Scots</HI> Salt, did not keep, nor was it equal in Goodness when it came to Market, which added to the Disputes which would arise in the Article of the Drawbacks, now coming on to be Debated, made the Parliament positive in that part, <HI>viz:</HI> That all Fish Cured for Exportation, should be Cured with Foreign Salt, without any Mixture of <HI>British</HI> Salt.</P>
<P>In giving Drawbacks and Allowances for the Exportati∣on of Fish, on Account of the Salt, it had here been impos∣sible to come to an Equality, since no Officer could have been sure which had been Cur'd with <HI>British</HI> Salt, and which with Foreign Salt, and which with a Mixture of either.</P>
<P>It was then alledged, That the <HI>Dutch</HI> Importing their Salt from St. <HI>Ʋbies,</HI> Re-make the Salt, Boyling it again when they come to <HI>Holland,</HI> which they call <HI>Salt upon Salt,</HI> and that their Herring are Cur'd with the said Salt, which being of a finer and subtiler Quality than the other Salt, is of Ad∣vantage to their said Trade; and that the aforesaid Encourage∣ment should be given to the <HI>Scots</HI> to do the same—; But this came to nothing.</P>

<P>Thereafter the last Clause of the Eighth Article of Union, in re∣lation to the allowing of <HI>Proemiums</HI> and <HI>Draw-backs</HI> was read, as
<PB N="136" REF="423"/>
also a Report brought in from the Committee to whom the said Eighth Article was remitted insert in the Minutes of the 17th in∣stant, <HI>Number</HI> 39. in these Terms; <HI>But in respect it appears from the Books of the Royal Fisherie Company confirmed by Practice, that the Quantity of</HI> 102 1058/1200 <HI>of pound weight</HI> Aver de Pois <HI>of Foreign Salt, which pays eight Shillings and four pence of Duty, is necessary for the right Curing and Packing a Barrel of White-Herrings; Therefore, there shall be paid during the present Allowances for other Fishes, for every Barrel of White Herrings which shall be Exported, ten Shillings</HI> Ster∣ling.</P>
<P>And another Report brought in from the said Committee was also read, in these Terms, <HI>That sixteen Shillings and eight Pence upon every Barrel of Salmond, six Shilling and eight Pence upon every Barrel of Red-Herrings, that two Pound ten Shillings upon every hundred Cod∣fish, Ling, or Haick, of twenty four Inches and upwards, from the Bone in the Finn to the third Joynt of the Tail; one Pound fifteen Shillings</HI> Sterling <HI>for every such Fish of the length of eighteen Inches and up∣wards, and under twenty four Inches, and one Moiety of the foresaid Allowance for every such Fish dryed, commonly called</HI> Haverdens, <HI>of the like Dimensions (being the Drawbacks allowed by the</HI> English <HI>Laws upon the Exportation of these Fishes) are sufficient Encouragements.</HI></P>
<P>And after Reasoning on the above several Reports, it being moved a higher Drawback should be allowed upon the Exportati∣on of White Herring;</P>
<P>After some Debate thereon, the said last Clause of the Eighth Article of Union was agreed to with this Addition, <HI>That there shall be allowed and paid to the Subjects Inhabitants of</HI> Great-Britain, <HI>du∣ring the present Allowances for other Fishes, for every Barrel of White Herrings which shall be Exported from</HI> Scotland, <HI>ten Shillings and five Pence</HI> sterling.</P>

<P>The Difficulty now lay about settling the Drawbacks upon the Exportation of Fish—; and the Rule the Committee had gone upon, seemed the readiest way to Determine it, <HI>viz.</HI> They laid the <HI>English</HI> Drawbacks before them, and Exa∣mined then the Quantity of Salt used in Curing every re∣spective kind of Fish, and then comparing the whole, tryed whether the Drawback allowed was adequate, and proporti∣oned to the Duty paid upon the Quantity of Salt used in the Curing.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="424"/>
Now, tho' this was Exactly Calculated, and presented to the House, yet several Motions and Speeches were made for a larger Drawback, some alledged the necessity of Encou∣raging the Fishery in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and that therefore the Govern∣ment ought to make larger Allowances; but when they saw that whatever the Allowance should be which they should obtain, the <HI>English</HI> would obtain the same, they dropt that part of the Argument.</P>
<P>The Herrings indeed they had longer Debates about, and after some Reasonings upon the Waste of the Salt, the Car∣riage and other Pretences, They obtained the Allowance of Ten Shillings and Five Pence to be paid to the Exporter, for every Barrel of Herrings Cured with Foreign Salt and Ex∣ported, which was Five Pence <HI>per</HI> Barrel more than the Com∣mittee had at first Determined.</P>

<P>The Drawbacks proposed upon Beef and Pork to be Ex∣ported, were now the Subject of Debate, it had been Examined in the Committee, and they finding, That 1. The <HI>English</HI> had no Allowance made them on Beef and Pork Cured for Exporta∣tion.
<PB N="138" REF="425"/>
And 2. That the Quantity of Beef and Pork so salted, and Exported out of <HI>England,</HI> or out of <HI>Scotland,</HI> was very inconsiderable, had Reported, <HI>That there ought to be no Drawbacks upon the Exportation of salted Beef and Pork,</HI> as in the Minute of <HI>December</HI> 19th.</P>
<P>But when this came to be Debated in the Parliament, it was all Unravelled again; Some Gentlemen would have it, That <HI>Scotland</HI> was able to Export great Quantities of Beef, Salted and Cured to Foreign Parts; Nay, some had before carried it further, and in their Arguing for a Trade with <HI>France,</HI> had advanced what had never before been heard of, <HI>viz.</HI> That <HI>Scotland</HI> should supply <HI>France</HI> with Beef, as they have formerly been supplyed from <HI>Ireland,</HI> and proposed In∣finite Advantages from such a Trade—.</P>
<P>But these Gentlemen were soon silenced, when it was Ex∣amined a little, upon what Conditions, and in what Quanti∣ties <HI>Ireland</HI> was able to supply, and did supply, not <HI>France</HI> and our Island Colonies only, but were able to supply all the Parts of the World, where Beef was Generally Exported—; That at that time Beef in any Quantity was to be bought, ready Cured in <HI>Ireland,</HI> including the Salt and the Cask it was Packed in, at a Half-penny <HI>sterling per</HI> Pound, and that <HI>England</HI> was so convinc'd of this, that they could Export no Flesh, but sent their Ships Generally to <HI>Ireland,</HI> to Load Beef for their Islands, and that <HI>France</HI> upon all Occasions, got their Beef, if possible, from <HI>Ireland,</HI> for the Victualling their Navys and Merchant Ships—. Again, that the Cattel in <HI>Ireland</HI> were Larger and Fatter than in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and their Quantity so great, that <HI>England</HI> was obliged to Prohibit their being brought over thither, otherwise they would Over run the three Kingdoms with the Quantity; and that <HI>Scotland</HI> having less Quantity of Feeding Grounds, and their Cattel being Generally Lesser, it was not possible that they could supply the Quantity of Beef, or any thing near the Price with the <HI>Irish;</HI> and that therefore, it could not be supposed, the Exportation of Beef from <HI>Scotland</HI> could be considerable, any more than from <HI>England;</HI> and on this Foot it was that the Committee made their Report, That it was not needful to allow any Drawback upon the Exportation of Beef, <HI>England</HI> at the same Time having no Allowances granted in the same Case.</P>
<P>But a new Objection turned the Scale—, It was offered by some, That in the North East Parts of <HI>Scotland, viz.</HI> At <HI>Aberdeen</HI> and the Country adjacent, there was a New and very Advantageous Trade, lately Erected for Feeding Swine, which being made Fat with Corn in great Quantities (&amp; that being a Consumption of the Produce of the Land) the Flesh was Cured and Salted, Barrelled and Exported to <HI>Holland</HI> for Sale—; And that this was a Trade which ought to be Encouraged. It was added, That this as it was an
<PB N="139" REF="426"/>
Advantageous Trade to <HI>Scotland,</HI> so it was a Growing Trade, and might in Time increase to a very great Degree, the <HI>Dutch</HI> Demanding every year more Quantities than the Country had been yet able to supply, that there had been several years Exported from 1500 to 2000 Barrels of salted Pork—from <HI>Scotland</HI> to <HI>Holland,</HI> the <HI>Dutch</HI> using the same for Victualling their East <HI>India</HI> Ships, and other Ships that went upon long Voyages.</P>
<P>This had some appearance of Argument in it, and being push'd very heartily at, in behalf of the <HI>Aberdeen</HI> Merchants; brought the Parliament to alter the Report, and agree to an Allowance upon the Exportation of Pork, and afterward of Beef and Pork, the Beef being brought in by the by.</P>
<P>It had been said, as above, That the <HI>Irish</HI> Beef was Exported Cheaper than <HI>Scotland</HI> could afford it—; It was therefore Argued, That <HI>Scotland</HI> ought to have the Drawback allowed on their Beef, to encourage the Exportation, and if possible, to set them upon an equal Foot with <HI>Ireland,</HI> in the Trade of Exporting Beef, which, tho' it was proved, was not pro∣bable, yet as the <HI>Affirmative</HI> carried some possibility, and the <HI>Negative</HI> seemed to be of no great Consequence, the Members came in to it, and they passed together.</P>

<P>The Debates about the Drawbacks on Beef and Pork ended now in a short Question, Whether it should be Four Shillings Seven Pence <HI>per</HI> Barrel, or Five Shillings—; And the Difference being of no great Consequence, the same Argu∣ments that carryed it before to have any Drawback at all, carryed it now to have that Drawback settled at the largest Rate of the Two, so that Affair ended.</P>
<P>Then the House proceeded to the Grand Affair, the Ex∣emptions from the Salt Tax in <HI>England</HI>—; Great Quar∣rels were raised at the Concessions made by the Treaters in this Case, who had exempted <HI>Scotland</HI> from the Duties on Salt payable in <HI>England</HI> for Seven Years only; whereas it was alledged, That the Salt Tax was a Burden Intolerable for <HI>Scotland,</HI> and that they would no more be able to bear that Duty in seven years, than now, and that therefore they ought not to have Subjected <HI>Scotland</HI> to it at all; That it had been allowed, the Salt Tax was a Burden chiefly laid upon the Poor, the Poor People in <HI>Scotland</HI> Feeding much upon salt Meats, and using great Quantities of Salt—; That to lay a Tax on their Salt, was to assist in Starving them, and the like—. This was an Argument so pleasing, and so much Improved without Doors, that it made the Opposers of the Union grow popular, and seem as if they were but meer Advocates for the Poor; That they were now really De∣fending their Country, which the Commissioners had aban∣doned, and shewed, that the Concern for the Burdening
<PB N="141" REF="428"/>
<HI>Scotland</HI> with unreasonable Exactions had not been part of their Business—; Great Hopes therefore were conceived from this Debate by some People, who had the Destruction of the Treaty chiefly in their Eyes, for as the Struggle had not been small in <HI>England,</HI> to obtain an Exemption from the Salt Tax to <HI>Scotland</HI> for Seven Years, it was more than probable, That, if a perpetual Exemption was insisted on, the <HI>English</HI> Parlia∣ment would refuse it, and so the Union might split upon that Rock; which being so specious, and seeming to be all done in meer Concern for the Poor of <HI>Scotland,</HI> would there∣fore engage all the People of <HI>Scotland</HI> in Defence of it—; But this Cloud vanish'd afterward, tho' at first it look'd black enough.</P>

<P>And after further Reasoning on the said Clause, another Clause was given in in these Terms, <HI>But</HI> Scotland <HI>shall, in all time after the Ʋnion, be exempted from paying of all Duty or Tax on Salt made in</HI> Scot∣land, <HI>in so far allennarly as the said Salt shall be made use of within that Part of</HI> Great Britain <HI>now called</HI> Scotland, <HI>but all Salt made in</HI> Scotland, <HI>from and after the Ʋnion, that shall be Exported to that Part of</HI> Great Britain <HI>now called</HI> England, <HI>or to any other Nation in</HI> specie, <HI>or that shall be Imployed in Salting of Fish or Flesh to be Exported, or for</HI>

<HI>Victualling of Ships to go to</HI> England, <HI>or any other Nation, shall be ly∣able to the same Duties, as shall be then payable for Salt made in</HI> Eng∣land, <HI>to be Levyed and Secured in the same manner, and with the like Drawbacks and Allowances, as in</HI> England; <HI>And that, after the Ʋnion, no Salt whatsoever be brought from</HI> Scotland <HI>to</HI> England <HI>by Land in any manner, under the Penalty of</HI></P>
<P>And after further Debate on the said two Clauses, the Vote was stated, <HI>Approve of the first Clause or second.</HI></P>
<P>But before Voting, it was agreed, That the Members Votes shall be Marked, and that the List of their Names, as they shall Vote, be Printed and Recorded.</P>
<P>And the Duke of <HI>Athole</HI> gave in the following Protest, <HI>Whereas Salt is the most useful and necessary Ingredient in all sorts of Victuals, any Duties or Excise on the same may prove a most grievous and insup∣portable Burden, especially on the Commons, I do therefore Protest for my self, and in Name of all who shall Adhere, That the People of this Kingdom now called</HI> Scotland, <HI>shall be free for ever of any Duties and Excises on the Salt made within this Kingdom:</HI></P>
<P>Which being Read, he took Instruments thereupon.</P>

<P>Thereafter it was moved to read over the said Eighth Article of Union, with the several Additions and Alterations, in order to the Approving thereof.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATION XLIV.</HEAD>
<P>The Debate of the last Day being Renewed, occasioned some Warmth in the House, and great Arguings there were about the Poor in <HI>Scotland</HI> being Unable to pay the Tax upon Salt at all, and that therefore they ought not to be left to the Mercy of the <HI>British</HI> Parliament; the Matters also of the Disproportion in the Duties to the Value in the respective Kingdoms, was also made a strong Motive against the Duty being laid upon the <HI>Scots,</HI> as a plain Inequality, since, as the Duty on Salt lay then, being Taxed by Weight, the <HI>Scots</HI> should pay Sixteen Shillings Four Pence upon what in their Country yielded <HI>exclusive</HI> of the Duty but Three Shillings; Whereas the <HI>English</HI> should pay no more on the Value of Ten Shillings Six Pence, which was a great Disparity in the Taxation by Value—. But to this it was Answered, If the Bulk or Quantity of Salt was equal, and <HI>Scotland</HI> having their Salt made just where it was Expended, had, or could buy as much for Three Shillings, as the <HI>English</HI> had, or could buy for Ten Shillings Six Pence, the Weight of the Salt being the same, they were so much the better able to pay Sixteen Shillings Four Pence on that Quantity of Salt in <HI>Scotland,</HI> by how much it was had Cheaper by Seven Shil∣lings Six Pence in its first Cost, than the <HI>English</HI> were, who were obliged to pay Seven Shillings Six Pence for the same Quantity in its first Cost, than the <HI>Scots</HI> payed.</P>
<P>To this again was Objected, the Poverty of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and the Difference this made in the Price of Salt to the Poor, how necessary the Salt was to the Subsistence of the Poor, and how much it would raise the Price, to the General Discou∣ragement and Impoverishing the Labouring part of the Peo∣ple, the <HI>English</HI> Duties being very near one Penny <HI>per</HI> Pound <HI>sterling</HI> upon the Salt, most of which Duty would ly on those who were least able to bear it; And this, as I Noted before, made the Argument become popular, and the Opposers of the Union began to be counted Patriots, who strove meerly for the securing their Country from Unreasonable and Insup∣portable Taxes.</P>
<P>It is necessary to Note here, <HI>in order to let the Reader in∣to a true state of this Question,</HI> what the <HI>English</HI> Duties on Salt were, which were thus strenuously Argued against—, they were in short thus.<LIST>
<ITEM>Twelve Pence <HI>per</HI> Bushel on Salt, each Bushel to Weigh Fifty Six Pound <HI>Aver du Pois</HI> Weight, granted by the <HI>English</HI> Parliament <HI>Anno</HI> 5<SUP>o</SUP> <HI>William</HI> and <HI>Mary,</HI> appro∣priated to the year 1710.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Twenty Eight Pence <HI>per</HI> Bushel, Weighing as above,
<PB N="144" REF="431"/>
granted 9<HI>th</HI> King <HI>William,</HI> and appropriated for the payment of Annuities Redeemable by Parliament.</ITEM>
</LIST> As may more at large be seen in the Appendix.</P>
<P>The Treaters at <HI>London</HI> had agreed on both Hands, to Exempt <HI>Scotland</HI> from the whole Tax upon Salt for seven Years as appears in the Observations on the Minutes of the Eighth Article in that Treaty—, but had then left it—, with a Concession, that then <HI>Scotland</HI> should pay as <HI>England</HI> should pay at that Time—, only it was supposed, the <HI>British</HI> Parliament would Consider, Whether <HI>Scotland</HI> was any bet∣ter able to pay then than before—, according to that Clause added in the Fourteenth Article, <HI>viz. That it could not be supposed, that the Parliament of</HI> Great-Britain <HI>would ever lay any sorts of Burdens upon the Ʋnited Kingdom, but what they should find of Necessity at that time, for the Preservation and Good of the whole—, and with due Regard to</HI> the Circumstan∣ces and Abilities <HI>of every part of the Ʋnited Kingdom.</HI></P>
<P>But it was again alledged, That the Words in this Eighth Article, <HI>viz. But from the Expiration of the said seven years,</HI> Scotland <HI>shall be lyable to the same Duties for Salt made in</HI> Scot∣land, <HI>as shall be then payable for Salt made in</HI> England, <HI>Vide</HI> the Treaty at <HI>London</HI> Article VIII. <HI>Page</HI> 5<HI>th.</HI> Obliged the <HI>Scots</HI> to the payment, and put it out of the Power of the Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> to Alter it; and that therefore the Parliament of <HI>Scotland</HI> ought to take effectual Care to prevent it, and to secure the People of Scotland against it.</P>
<P>There were a great many Speeches made on this Subject, and something Harsh enough past on both sides, which I care not to Relate—, for the sakes of the Gentlemen that shewed themselves a little out of Temper here—; But at length a <HI>Medium</HI> was proposed in the Terms <HI>of the first Clause of the Mi∣nute,</HI> which Exempted <HI>Scotland</HI> from the Two Shillings Four Pence <HI>per</HI> Bushel, mentioned above, and appropriated to the East <HI>India</HI> Company, and let the Twelve Pence <HI>per</HI> Bushel stand, as a Thing not of so much Consequence, 1. Because the Sum was not so considerable, as to make it Insupportable to the Poor. 2. It was not appropriated to any payment fur∣ther than to the year 1710, and so might Determine in a short Time; Whereas the Two Shillings Four Pence <HI>per</HI> Bushel, was actually settled as a Fund for payment of Annuities for Ninety Nine Years, and must certainly fall upon <HI>Scotland</HI> at the end of seven Years.</P>
<P>This seemed a very reasonable Proposal, tho' it did not answer the End of these Gentlemen, whose Aim, as I Hinted before, was at the Treaty in General—. For it was a Mode∣rating between both, bearing a part which they could bear,
<PB N="145" REF="432"/>
and yet taking off that part which the Poor were said to be pinch'd by, and which they pretended would effectually have raised a National Discontent.</P>
<P>The Gentlemen on the other side, were a little silenced with this Proposal—; they at first indeed positively insisted, as in the D. of <HI>A—ls</HI> Protest, That <HI>Scotland</HI> should be for ever free <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of all Duties on Salt—, but they were subdued by the Reasonings of the other Gentlemen, upon the Equity of the above Proposal, and unless, as in General, objecting against the whole Treaty, there was no withstanding it—; yet after some Debating, there was found an Exception to this too, and that was, That tho' the Two Shillings four Pence was thus provided against, it was but a single Term, and the Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> might set that Duty aside, and lay some other Tax on in the Room of it, which might be the same thing, or worse, and so this Exemption might be Eluded, and this they called without Doors, <HI>a Design to Trepan</HI> Scotland, <HI>or draw her into the snare of the Duty, under the pretence of an Exemption.</HI></P>
<P>But this was soon Warded against, and the latter part of the Clause effectually stopt that Gap, <HI>viz. That if the Parlia∣ment of</HI> Great-Britain <HI>shall at, or before the Expiring of the said seven years, substitute any other Fund in the place of the said Two Shillings Four Pence of Excise on the Bushel of Home Salt—,</HI> Scotland <HI>shall after the said seven years, bear a proportion of the said Fund,</HI> but <HI>shall have an Equivalent in the Terms of the Treaty,</HI> that is in the Terms of the Fourteenth Article, which says, That <HI>Scotland shall have an Equivalent for what the Subjects thereof shall be Charged towards payment of the Debts of</HI> England, <HI>in all particulars whatsoever,</HI> Vide Treaty at <HI>Lon∣don</HI> Art. 15. <HI>Pag.</HI> 9.</P>
<P>This brought the Matter of Debate to an End, and there was nothing left but to put the Vote—, the other Party of∣fered a Clause of General and Absolute Exemption, as <HI>per</HI> the Minute—; but it was Voted not to be the state of the Que∣stion, so the Affair ended with the D. of <HI>A—ls</HI> Protest, as <HI>per</HI> the Minute.</P>
<P>Yet it must be observed, That this step taken by the Par∣liament, went a great way to stop the Mouths of the People, who began to be strangely Allarm'd at the Apprehensions of the Salt Duty, which was cryed out upon as Insupportable,; but their being wholly Exempted from it for seven years, and for ever Exempt from all but Twelve Pence <HI>per</HI> Bushel, the Burden was both lessened in the Main, and Remote in pro∣spect, and so the General Clamour wore off.</P>
<P>It was indeed a great Abatement to that Article as stated at <HI>London,</HI> and some People flattered themselves with the Hopes, that it would occasion some Debates in the Parliament in <HI>England,</HI> and perhaps suffer some Alterations there, which
<PB N="146" REF="433"/>
might occasion the Returning the whole to <HI>Scotland</HI> again—; But that View proved Fictitious, and the Gentlemen found themselves disappointed.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATION XLV.</HEAD>
<P>The Eighth Article was now passed without any more De∣bates, the Amendments were all Read, being put together, and as the House had Ordered, Transcribed into Form, as you will find them in the Treaty, Printed in the <HI>Appendix.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="434"/>
And now we are come to the great Article of the Equiva∣lent, which has of it self made more Noise in the World, than all the other Articles; and which, tho' in it self founded upon the highest Justice to <HI>Scotland,</HI> being the only Mean to bring the Discording Circumstances of the Nations to Unite, and was stated with the greatest Exactness, and the nicest and most unexceptionable Calculations, that the Wit of Man could perform; yet it met with the greatest Opposition, and was Treated with the most Contempt in <HI>Scotland</HI> of any other part of the Union; Nay to that Degree, that, when the very Money it self came to be brought into <HI>Scotland,</HI> the Common People were excited to that Height, as to call it the Price of their Country, and to Insult the very People that brought it.</P>
<P>I must therefore be excused, if the Observations on this Point exceed the Bounds of that Brevity I at first proposed to my self, and that I endeavour to be as particular as pos∣sible upon this Head.</P>
<P>The first Clause of this Article had been Voted and Agreed to, not without a great Struggle in the Parliament, on the Seventh of the same Month of <HI>December,</HI> as <HI>per</HI> the Observa∣tions upon the Minutes of that Day appears, to which I re∣fer, and the remaining part of the Article was adjourned till the Reports of the Committee appointed to consider of the Sixth and Eighth Articles were received and considered, which being now ended, the House proceeded to the subsequent Articles.</P>
<P>The First Clause of the Article was the main Prelimi∣nary to the rest, <HI>viz.</HI> Whether <HI>Scotland</HI> should be oblig∣ed to come in to the appropriated Duties of <HI>England,</HI> and consequently have her Revenues appropriated to the payment of the <HI>English</HI> Debts, receiving from <HI>Eng∣land</HI> an Equivalent—; What that Equivalent should be, <HI>viz. Ready Money?</HI> How much it should be, <HI>viz.</HI> Three Hundred Ninety Eight Thousand Eighty Five Pounds Ten Shillings—? And whether that Sum was rightly calculated? All this was determined as above.</P>
<P>The second Clause which came now to be debated was thus, <HI>And in regard, That, after the Ʋnion,</HI> Scotland <HI>becoming liable to the same Customs and Duties payable on Import and Ex∣port, and to the same Excises on all Exciseable Liquors as in</HI> England, <HI>as well upon that Account as upon the Account of the Encrease of Trade and People, (which will be the Happy Conse∣quence of the Ʋnion) The said Revenues will much improve be∣yond the before mentioned Annual Values thereof, of which no present Estimate can be made; Yet nevertheless, for the Reasons aforesaid, there ought to be a proportionable Equivalent answered to</HI> Scotland; It is agreed, <HI>That, after the Ʋnion, there shall</HI>
<PB N="148" REF="435"/>
<HI>be an Account kept of the said Duties arising in</HI> Scotland, <HI>to the end it may appear, what ought to be Answer'd to</HI> Scotland, <HI>as an Equivalent for such Proportion of the said Encrease, as shall be applicable to the Payment of the Debts of</HI> England.</P>
<P>This was only to oblige the Persons appointed by the Go∣vernment to direct the Treasury of <HI>Britain,</HI> That an exact Account might be kept, what part of the Revenue of <HI>Scot∣land</HI> was to be appropriate, and for which the Equivalent was to be raised, in order also to come to a Certainty in the Measures which were to be taken with the Remainder—; And therefore this needed little Debate, yet it will occasion a further Remark presently.</P>
<P>The Third Clause runs thus, <HI>And for the further and more effectual answering the several Ends hereafter mentioned,</HI> it is a∣greed, <HI>That, from and after the Ʋnion, the whole Encrease of the Revenues of Customs, and Duties on Import and Export, and Excise upon Exciseable Liquors in</HI> Scotland, <HI>over and above the Annual Produce of the said respective Duties, as above stated, shall go and be apply'd, for the Term of Seven Years, to the Ʋses here∣after mentioned.</HI></P>
<P>This was a general Referring also to the Particulars, to which the Overplus of the Revenue of <HI>Scotland</HI> should be ap∣plyed, and this will also come to be discoursed of in its place, being here pass'd of Course.</P>
<P>The Fourth Clause was, <HI>And that, upon the said Account, there shall be answered to</HI> Scotland <HI>Annually, from the end of Seven Years after the Ʋnion, an Equivalent in Proportion to such Part of the said Encrease, as shall be applicable to the Debts of</HI> England.</P>
<P>This Clause could admit no Debate on the <HI>Scots</HI> side, since, as they had agreed, by the first Clause, to come into an Equality of Duties, this was Capitulating in behalf of <HI>Scotland,</HI> That an Equivalent should be paid by <HI>England</HI> for so much of the Revenues of <HI>Scotland,</HI> as should be applyed to the <HI>English</HI> Debts, over and above what had been already stated in the Equivalent named in the former Clause.</P>
<P>And here I shall take the Freedom to quote what the for∣mer Gentleman I quoted before gave <HI>as his Opinion</HI> on this very Head, I mean Mr. Baron <HI>Clark,</HI> whose Judgment I think I may be allowed to appeal to, and who was a Witness to, and present in Parliament at all these Debates. <HI>See his Essay on the</HI> 15<HI>th. Article of the Ʋnion, Pag.</HI> 13<HI>th.</HI> in these Words—<Q><P>2. That which is most Remarkable in this whole Ar∣ticle, and particularly to be taken Notice of, is this, <HI>viz.</HI> That, from the Commencement of the <HI>Union,</HI> the whole Increase of the Revenues of <HI>Customs and Duties</HI> on Im∣port and Export, and <HI>Excise</HI> upon <HI>Exciseable Liquors,</HI> over and above the Annual Produce of the said respective Duties, as above stated, shall be applyed for the Term of 
<PB N="149" REF="436"/>
Seven Years, to the Use and Advantage of <HI>Scotland,</HI> the Meaning whereof is hereby Illustrated.</P>
<P>Suppose, the <HI>Customs</HI> of <HI>Scotland,</HI> after the Union, <HI>(what upon the Account of a greater Trade, or upon the Account of taking upon us the</HI> English <HI>Customs)</HI> should increase to 80000 Pounds <HI>Sterling, which I believe no Trading Man will doubt of;</HI> then 'tis plain, that in regard there's an Increase of these Customs of 50000 Pounds above the present Extent, therefore that Increase is by this Paragraph allowed to <HI>Scotland</HI> yearly, for the foresaid <HI>Term</HI> of Seven Years, <HI>which will be a great Encouragement to</HI> Scotland, <HI>and by Consequence an Advantage to the whole</HI> Island; <HI>since 'tis not to be doubted, but such an</HI> Annual Sum <HI>of</HI> 50000 Pounds <HI>will be imployed during that time, towards such Ends and Uses as will be most for the Honour and Advantage of this Poor Country.</HI></P>
<P>Ʋpon this Concession of the Increase of <HI>Customs and Ex∣cises</HI> for Seven Years, 'tis likewise to be observed, That the Sum of 22874 Pounds that falls at <HI>September</HI> 1710 above∣mentioned, will likewise go for the Remainder of the Term of Seven Years, after the Ʋnion, towards the behoof of <HI>Scotland,</HI> if so be that the Customs and Excises that raise that Sum are continued, and not appropriated for other Ʋses.</P>
<P N="3">3 From the last part of the Paragraph, 'tis to be observ∣ed, That there shall be answered to <HI>Scotland</HI> Annually, af∣ter the Expiration of the foresaid Term of Seven Years, an <HI>Equivalent</HI> in Proportion to such parts of the Increase as shall be applyed towards Payment of the Debts of <HI>England.</HI> For Explaining of which, it may be observed,</P>
<P>Suppose, after the foresaid Term of Seven Years, the Cu∣stoms of <HI>Scotland</HI> should rise to 120000 Pounds yearly, which is an Increase of 90000 Pounds above what they are new stated at; in that Case, the said Increase of 90000 Pounds wou'd be disposed of as follows,</P>

<P>This last Article of the Accompt is very Remarkable, ex∣tending to no less than a Sum of 71287 Pounds to be appli∣cable towards the Debts contracted before the Ʋnion. But this needs not amuse any Person: For in the <HI>first</HI> place, it was supposed, if there be a Peace concluded, and so an end put to the present <HI>War,</HI> then will the Debts of <HI>England</HI> be in a few Years fully payed. The Consequence of which will be, That the Customs and Excises, which after the Ʋnion, 
<PB N="150" REF="437"/>
will be payable by the Subjects of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> shall then be intirely taken off and let fall. In the <HI>next</HI> place, Tho' the said Sum of 71287 Pounds be applicable yearly towards the Payment of <HI>English</HI> Debts; yet there shall be an Annual <HI>Equivalent</HI> given by <HI>England</HI> to the Extent of that Sum. Which leads us to consider a <HI>Question,</HI> Whe∣ther or not that Sum of 71287 Pounds will be sent up yearly to <HI>England</HI> for paying these Debts? I <HI>Answer,</HI> No, for if it should, then, by the Nature of the Equivalents, that very Sum behoved to be sent back to us again, which is a certain needless Trouble; and Lawyers, when they intend to amuse their Clients with speaking a sort of La∣tine; have this in their Mouths, applicable enough to this Purpose, <HI>Frustra petitur quod mox est restituendum.</HI></P>
<P>Wherefore any Man may see, that this Sum is not to be sent to <HI>England,</HI> but must remain among us.</P>
<P>Could it ever have entered into the Heads of Men, in their right Wits, to burden a Poor Nation with an An∣nual Payment of a great Sum, for Debts they never con∣tracted, without at the same time allowing a Re-imburse∣ment to them? And if so, can we imagine, that Matters will be so confounded, as that they must send yearly great Sums out of <HI>Scotland</HI> to <HI>England,</HI> for no other End, than immediately to be returned back again? This is so ridicu∣lous, that 'tis scarcely to be spoken of.</P></Q></P>
<P>Thus far Mr. Baron <HI>Clark,</HI> to which I shall add nothing, but that his Reasonings were so plain, that they needed no Explication—</P>
<P>The Fifth Clause was thus, <HI>And whereas, from the Expira∣tion of Seven Years after the Ʋnion,</HI> Scotland <HI>is to be lyable to the same Duties for Salt made in</HI> Scotland, <HI>as shall be then pay∣able for Salt made in</HI> England; It is agreed, <HI>That, when such Duties take place there, an Equivalent shall be Answered to</HI> Scot∣land <HI>for such Part thereof, as shall be apply'd towards payment of the Debts of</HI> England; <HI>Of which Duties an Account shall be kept, to the end it may appear, what is to be Answered to</HI> Scot∣land <HI>as the said Equivalent.</HI></P>
<P>This required only to be left out as being useless, since the Affair of the Salt was settled otherways in the prece∣dent Days Vote; So that hitherto these were all Negative Clauses in the Main.</P>
<P>The Sixth Clause was, <HI>And generally, That an Equivalent shall be Answered to</HI> Scotland <HI>for such Parts of the</HI> English <HI>Debts, as</HI> Scotland <HI>may hereafter become lyable to pay by Reason of the Ʋnion, other than such for which Appropriations have been made by Parliament in</HI> England <HI>of the Customs, or other Duties on Ex∣port and Import, Excises on all Exciseable Liquors or Salt, in Respect of which Debts, Equivalents are herein before provided.</HI></P>

would not have <HI>Scotland</HI> come into the <HI>English</HI> Debts at all, but having consented to come in as far as the Equivalent ex∣tended, they were for making a Stop there—; But this was found Impracticable, after the Duties which were to be paid by <HI>Scotland</HI> were assented to, to have turned them from the Channel of Appropriation which the like Duties in <HI>Eng∣land</HI> were appointed to run in by Act of Parliament, could not well be done, so after a short Dispute about the Possibi∣lity of this, it was pass'd over also.</P>
<P>They now came to the Debate of the Application of the Equivalent, but this was too long a Subject to enter upon that Day, so it was adjourned to the next Time—.</P>

<P>The Lord Chancellor acquainted the Parliament, That notwith∣standing, the several Addresses brought in, and presented to the Parliament, <HI>Against an Incorporating Ʋnion with</HI> England, <HI>in the Terms of the Articles,</HI> have been under due Consideration, during the whole Procedure, upon the <HI>Articles of Ʋnion:</HI> Yet there is now Information, that <HI>Letters</HI> are sent through several Corners of the Kingdom, Desiring the Subscrivers of these <HI>Addresses,</HI> to come in and Assemble at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> upon pretence of waiting the Effect of the said <HI>Addresses,</HI> and of knowing what Return the Parliament will give them. All which he was directed by his Grace, Her Majesties high Commissioner, to lay before the Parliament, to the Effect pro∣per Measures may be resolved upon, for preventing any Evil Con∣sequences from these Practices.</P>
<P>And after some Discourse thereupon, a <HI>Proclamation</HI> was brought in and Read, against all such Mettings and Gatherings of the Sub∣jects as unwarrantable, and contrair to Law. And after further Discourse, as to the Ground of the Information.</P>
<P>Her Majesties High Commissioner, was pleased to signifie to the Parliament, That he had Information from several Corners of the Kingdom, of the great Pains and Methods, which had been used to procure Subscriptions to <HI>Addresses,</HI> and to call in to <HI>Edinburgh</HI> the Subscribers, against a precise Day to back these <HI>Addresses.</HI></P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATION XLVI.</HEAD>
<P>The Work of this Day Explains it self—, and needs but little Remark; This was a new shift, if possible, to have Di∣verted the Parliament from going on with the great Work of the Union, Tumults and Riots in the Country had been tryed in Vain, and the <HI>Glasgow</HI> Rabblers were closs in the Castle of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> Mobs and Rabbles in the Streets had been supprest, and the Guards did constant Duty in the City, walked the Rounds in the Night, and kept the Streets quiet, the Meeting of the Heretors and Fencible Men, had been Dis∣charged by Proclamation, and the Clause in the <HI>Act of Security,</HI> Licensing them to do so, had been Repealed; So that now no Room was left for violent Methods, except by open and actual Rebellion, and that had all possible provision made for it in the Laws, and the Queen had Ordered Troops to the Borders of <HI>England,</HI> as is before Noted, in order to assist and support the Government, in case of Necessity.</P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="440"/>
The only Pretence therefore now, was this, The Ad∣dresses, as you will Read in the Minutes, had been continually brought in against the Union from all parts of the Kingdom, Answers were not given, nor expected to be given by the Parliament, but they lay before the Parliament for their Consideration; and an Address lying before the Parliament, is, by the Nature of the Thing, supposed to be under Con∣sideration—; But the Addressers pretending, That no Re∣gard was had to their Addresses, pretend now to come all up to <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> to wait for, or rather to Demand Answers to their Addresses—; This was too bare faced a Pretence not to discover its own Meaning; And therefore the Parliament immediately agreed to the Proclamation, to Discharge or Forbid all such Gatherings or Meetings of the Subjects, as Unwarrantable and contrair to Law. See the Proclamation in the <HI>Appendix N<SUP>o</SUP>.</HI> B x x.</P>
<P>You will observe, That on several Occasions after the first Pro∣posal of Printing the Names of such as Voted on either side, the like List of Names was Ordered to be made publick—, it would have been too long to have subjoyned these to every Vote—, and also been Troublesome and Useless to the Reader—; But this Case being something singular, I have put the Names of the Members as they were Printed by Order of Parliament, in the Appendix of this Work, marked with this Mark D x x, by which some guess may be made, who Encouraged or Discouraged the Violences of those Times, and what Encouragement were suggested to those without, from the Proceedings and Conduct of those within.</P>
<P>It was expected by some People, That these Tumults should have had great Encouragement on the part of the Church; and great pains were taken to draw in the Ministers in several parts, to Espouse the Quarrel, and to appear with the People against the Union.</P>
<P>But the Ministers, however they shewed themselves against the Union in General, and against the several Particulars as they concerned them, yet they shewed no Inclination to Encourage the Tumultary Methods, that the Violent Tempers of other People, seemed to be precipitating the Nation into; and therefore the Letter written by the Commission to the several Presbyteries, was very seasonable, not only to prevent the Mischiefs Threatning the Peace of the Kingdom at that Time, but also to Vindicate the Commission of the Assembly from the Aspersions raised upon them from the above Sup∣position, Copy of which I have inserted in the <HI>Appendix,</HI> with the Answer of the Presbytery of <HI>Hamilton</HI> to it N<SUP>o</SUP>. O x, P x.</P>
<P>It would have been endless to have added here, the par∣ticular Addresses which were presented from the several parts of the Kingdom, however, some of the most significant I
<PB N="154" REF="441"/>
have added in the <HI>Appendix,</HI> marked as follows, Address from the Presbytery of <HI>Hamiltoun N<SUP>o</SUP>.</HI> N x, which was very particular, the Presbytery of <HI>Dumblain N<SUP>o</SUP>.</HI> L x. with the Address from <HI>Kirkcudbright N<SUP>o</SUP>.</HI> M x. the Town of New <HI>Gal∣loway N<SUP>o</SUP>.</HI> Q x, <HI>Dumfermling N<SUP>o</SUP>.</HI> R—. From these Ad∣dresses, the Bulk of the rest may be guessed at; Only it may be Noted, there were but three Presbyteries in the whole Kingdom that Addressed at all, viz. <HI>Lanerk, Hamiltoun</HI> and <HI>Dumblain,</HI> there being Sixty Eight Presbyteries in the whole.</P>

<P>Thereafter the first part of the Seventh and last Clause of the Fifteenth Article of Union, beginning thus, <HI>And as for the Ʋses, to which the said Sum of</HI> 398085 Pounds, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> was again Read, and after Reasoning, the Representation of the Council Gene∣ral of the Company of <HI>Scotland</HI> Trading to <HI>Africa</HI> and the <HI>Indies</HI> was also again Read; and after further Reasoning thereupon, and upon the Application of the Equivalent, a Proposal was given in for altering and amending the said first part of the above Seventh, and last Clause of the said Fifteenth Article, in these Terms, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>It is agreed, That, in the first place, out of the foresaid Sum, what Consideration shall be found necessary to be had for any Losses which private Persons may sustain, by reducing the Coin of <HI>Scotland</HI> to the Standart and Value of the Coin of <HI>England</HI> may be made good. In the next place, That the Capital Stock, or Fund of the <HI>African</HI> and <HI>Indian</HI> Company of <HI>Scotland,</HI> advanced, together with the Interest of the said Capital Stock, after the Rate of Five <HI>per Cent. per Annum,</HI> from the respective Times of the pay∣ment thereof shall be payed: Upon payment of which Capital Stock and Interest, It is agreed, the said Company be Dissolved and Cease; and also, That, from the time of passing the Act of Parliament in <HI>England,</HI> for raising the said Sum of 398085 Pounds 10 Shillings, the said Company shall neither Trade nor grant Li∣cence to Trade; Providing, That, if the said Stock and Interest shall not be payed in Twelve Months, after the Commencement of the Union, That then the said Company may, from thence forward, Trade or give Licence to Trade, until the said haill Ca∣pital Stock and Interest shall be payed: And as to the Overplus of the said Sum of 398085 Pounds Ten Shillings, after payment of what Consideration shall be had for Losses in Repairing the Coin, and paying the said Capital Stock and Interest; and also the haill
<PB N="155" REF="442"/>
Increase of the said Revenues of Customs, Duties and Excises, above the present Value, which shall arise in <HI>Scotland</HI> during the said Term of Seven Years, together with the Equivalent, which shall become due upon the Improvement thereof in <HI>Scotland,</HI> after the said Term, and also as to all other Sums, which according to the Agreements aforesaid may become payable to <HI>Scotland</HI> by way of Equivalent, for what that Kingdom shall hereafter become lyable, towards payment of the Debts of <HI>England;</HI> It is agreed, That the same be applyed in manner following, <HI>viz.</HI> That all the Publick Debts of the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland,</HI> as shall be adjust∣ed by this present Parliament, shall be payed, and that 2000 Pounds <HI>Sterling per Annum,</HI> for the space of Seven Years, shall be apply∣ed towards Incouraging and Promoting the Manufacture of course Wooll within these Shires which produce the Wooll, and that the first 2000 Pounds <HI>Sterling</HI> be payed at <HI>Martinmass</HI> next, and so yearly at <HI>Martinmass</HI> during the space foresaid; and afterwards the same shall be wholly applyed towards the Incouraging and Promoting the Fisheries and such other Manufactures and Improve∣ments in <HI>Scotland,</HI> as may most conduce to the general Good of the United Kingdom.</P>
<P>Which being Read, and after Reasoning thereon, it was Moved, That the Company of <HI>Scotland</HI> Trading to <HI>Africa</HI> and the <HI>Indies</HI> be heard by their Lawyers upon the Rights and Priviledges of the said Company before any further Procedure: And after Debate,</P>
<P>The said haill Seventh and last Clause of the said Fifteenth Article of Union from these Words, <HI>And as for the Ʋses to which the said Sum of</HI> 398085 <HI>Pounds</HI> Sterling, to the end, with the above Altera∣tion and Amendment was Read over.</P>
<P>And thereupon there were Two States of a Vote offered, The First in these Terms, <HI>Approve of the Fifteenth Article of the Ʋnion as Al∣tered and Amended,</HI> Yea <HI>or</HI> Not; and the Second in these Terms, <HI>Whether this House will Dissolve the</HI> Indian <HI>and</HI> African <HI>Company, without the Consent of the Proprietors, and Hearing the Companies Law∣yers upon the Rights and Priviledges of the said Company,</HI> Yea <HI>or</HI> Not; and after some Reasoning which shall be the State of the Vote, <HI>First</HI> or <HI>Second.</HI></P>
<P>It was agreed before Voting, That the Members Votes be Marked, and that the List of their Names as they Vote, be Printed &amp; Recorded.</P>
<P>Then the Vote was put First or Second, and it carried First.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATION XLVII.</HEAD>
<P>Upon this part of the Application of the Equivalent, great Stir was made, on pretence of preserving the <HI>African</HI> Com∣pany, and some Papers were offered to the Parliament.</P>
<P>The Company made a long Representation to the Parli∣ament, needless to be inserted here—.</P>
<P>There were a Party who pretended to struggle, <HI>and some Motions appeared in the House to that purpose,</HI> against the Dis∣solving the <HI>African</HI> Company; It is confest, the Company was a Thing the Nation had a great Concern in, almost every considerable Family in the Kingdom having some share in the Stock, and consequently in the Loss, for it was reck∣oned no better: The Historical part of that Transaction does not relate to this place, but it may be proper to say a little to it, to introduce the true understanding of the Vote.</P>
<P>The Company had been Erected upon a General Subscrip∣tion of 600000 <HI>lib. sterling,</HI> most of it subscribed in <HI>Scotland,</HI> upon which every Subscriber had paid down a certain part of the Sum subscribed, and was lyable at the Call of the Com∣pany, to be pursued for the Remainder, and to pay it all in, as by the several Acts of Parliament, settling and confirming the said Company, will appear.</P>
<P>Upon the Miscarriage of the Expedition to <HI>Daricn,</HI> and the Return of their Ships, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the Company was so Discou∣raged and Disheartned, that no new Attempt either there, or any where else, had been so much as Talked of, nor were any other Payments demanded, the Loss of what was already Expended lying very heavy upon the Nation, and parti∣cularly upon some Families who could very ill bear it.</P>
<P>The Design had so effectually Miscarried, that the Stock advanc'd was not only Expended, but the Company was brought very low, and was very far in Debt upon the ac∣count of their said Expedition to <HI>Darien</HI>—, and the Sub∣scribers were always apprehensive of a Call upon them of some further payment, to discharge the Remainder due on the old Voyage, or perhaps to Form some new Expedition, and this made some People so Uneasie, that they sold their Stock in the said Company for Trifles, <HI>only to be secured against further Demands;</HI> In General, the Interest in the said Stock was come to so low an Ebb, that People valued them∣selves little or nothing upon their Shares in it, and when the first View of the Union came on, and some thought one way
<PB N="157" REF="444"/>
of it, some another, they either Bought or Sold as their Opi∣nion of the Union, and its prospect of Success either increased or decreased; and indeed the publick Expectation of the Success of the Union ran very low at this Time, as may be supposed, from the Value now put on the Stock of the <HI>African</HI> Company, which was fallen so low, that several People offered to Sell their whole Interest for 10 <HI>per Cent.</HI> on the Ori∣ginal Stock, tho' at the same time they saw, that if the Uni∣on took place, the whole principal Money with Interest was to be repaid them.</P>
<P>There seemed to be abundance of Difficulties in the way of the Treaty; he Fury of the Rabbles, the Tumults in the Streets, the Strength of the Opposition, and the abundance of Debates they were yet to go thro', gave so mean a prospect of the Union, that tho' it was an Article in the Treaty, that when it was Finished, all the Stock of the <HI>African</HI> Company should be repaid with Interest, as above, <HI>out of the Equivalent Money,</HI> yet no Body Valued themselves upon it then, nor were any very fond of Buying, tho' the Demand was extravagantly low; and indeed so low as told every one, the Sellers look∣ed upon it as a desparate Case, that they had no Dependance upon, and very little Expectation from</P>
<P>It was expected there should have been a Debate upon the previous Question, Whether the <HI>African</HI> Company should be Dissolved or no, and as <HI>per</HI> the Vote, it was proposed to hear Lawyers or Counsel in behalf of the Company, but it was apparent, this also was a Proposal not so much in behalf of the Company, as in order to put a full stop to the Uni∣on, since it was evident, two Companies could not be con∣sistent in <HI>Britain.</HI></P>
<P>Nor was it alledged, That the Proprietors of the Company had it been put to the Question, would have desired the Com∣pany to continue, and so have Disbursed further Sums to carry on their Trade, in hope of making up and recovering their Money; and this rather than have received their prin∣cipal Sums with Interest back again, which was a Thing they had no reason to expect.</P>
<P>The Proposal therefore was rejected, not that every Mans Consent in his own private Right was not acknowledged to be needful—; But this being a publick Act granted by Parliament, the Parliament first securing every Man his whole Principal and Interest, from the very time of payment, had undoubtedly a Power to Rescind their own Act, and cause cease all the Powers and Privileges which derived from them.</P>
<P>Upon this Foot, it was thought just to Repeal the Acts Establishing the Company, even without hearing their Lawyers, or demanding their Assent—. Again, had the Assent been demanded, it ought to have been not an Assent
<PB N="158" REF="445"/>
of the Directors or Council, but of every Proprietor, which, as it might have been Difficult, and perhaps Impossible, would have effectually answered the End of those Gentlemen, who sought to bring these Matters to a Head of Debate, and so have wrought out of them the wished for Delay to the <HI>Ʋnion</HI> then in hand.</P>
<P>Some also alledged this Case as parallel to the great Case now depending, and would have argued the last from the consequence of the first, <HI>viz.</HI> That as the Company could not be Dissolved by the Consent of the Directors, or Council, or Managers of their Affairs, but by the universal Consent of the whole Body of Subscribers; so neither could the Consti∣tution of <HI>Scotland</HI> be Altered by the Act and Deed of the Representative, without the Concurrence and Assent of the Constituents from whom the Representatives derived—. But this seeming parallel appeared to be Imperfect, and con∣sequently to be no parallel at all, since the Company could at any time be legally Dissolved, and their Charters, Privi∣leges, and Powers be made to cease, by the same Power that made them, without asking the Assent either of the Directors or Subscribers; <HI>That is,</HI> without Consulting the Representa∣tive or Constituent, Parts of that Body, and the Power so Dissolving, or taking away the said Company, had no other Obligation upon them, than in Justice to make good all Damage or Detriment to private Persons; and this was effectually done.</P>
<P>The Fate of the <HI>African</HI> Company of <HI>Scotland</HI> being thus Determined, the further Application of the Equivalent was the next Work—; and there seemed only two Things to call immediately for help.<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The Coin, which of Necessity required a new Re∣gulation.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The publick Debts of the Nation, which called loudly to be Discharged.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The Coin was agreed to be the first Consideration, and as <HI>per</HI> the Minute appears, was unanimously agreed to—, the state of which was in short thus;</P>
<P>By the lowness of the Coin in <HI>Scotland,</HI> both as to Quali∣ty and Quantity, I mean the Old Money, <HI>Scotland</HI> came un∣der this General Disadvantage, <HI>viz.</HI> That almost every Foreign Coin past current in <HI>Scotland</HI> to advantage: For Example—, the <HI>English</HI> Shilling past at Thirteen Pence, the <HI>French</HI> Crown which in <HI>London</HI> goes at Four Shillings Six Pence, past at Five Shillings, the <HI>Dutch</HI> Dollar at Fifty Eight Pence, the Bank Dollar, and Three other sorts commonly called the Wild-Horse, the Wild-Man, and Castle, being generally Im∣perial or Rex Dollars, were by Act of Council raised to Sixty Pence.</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="446"/>
This indeed had been occasioned by the Government in <HI>Scotland,</HI> formerly crying up their own Money above the usual Rate, a Thing always Fatal to the Nations that have thought fit to Venture upon it, and which Precipice <HI>England</HI> narrowly miss'd splitting upon <HI>in the late Restoration of her Coin,</HI> at which time, some People push'd hard at raising the Value of the Standart, not being aware of the National In∣jury of Raising the Value of Foreign <HI>Species,</HI> and subjecting the General Credit to a Loss on Exchange with all Nations of the World.</P>
<P>By the Union the Coin of <HI>Scotland</HI> was to be reduced, and brought to the <HI>English</HI> Standart, the Consequence of this was of necessity, that there would be a Loss upon all the kinds of Money, both Foreign and Proper—; To cry down the Foreign Money, and bring it to a Value, could not be, because the <HI>English</HI> Money being the Standart, was to be the only current Money, and all other Money would, as in <HI>England,</HI> go by Weight only; To sink the Difference in the Hands of particular Persons, who had such Money in Possession, would have been a great Loss upon the poor People, and what they could not easily bear—</P>
<P>The Advance upon the <HI>English</HI> Money, which was one Penny on every Shilling of the Silver, and Two Shillings Two Pence upon every Guinea, fell by the Course of Things, that Money being to go current at the Rates as in <HI>England,</HI> and this was no small Loss to the People that had <HI>English</HI> Money by them, but the Foreign and <HI>Scots</HI> Money being no more to be current, it was but reasonable, that the Publick should defray the Charge, and make good the Loss, and therefore this was allotted out of the Equivalent.</P>
<P>Nor was that all, but as this was a Case which admitted no Delay, so it obtained the Preference of every Thing else, for till this was settled, the Circulation of Money would have been stopp'd, and a general Stagnation of Trade would have followed, and therefore it was appointed to be made good out of the Equivalent, before the <HI>African</HI> Company was refunded, and this set the Mint quickly to Work, as will appear in its place.</P>
<P>The next thing to be paid out of the Equivalent was the Publick Debts, there were some who struggled heartily to have the Debts of the Government come in before the Affair of the <HI>African</HI> Company, but it could not be carryed, those Debts were not all ascertain'd, and the Claims were to be remitted to the Decision of the Law, at least many of them, and this would have left the <HI>African</HI> Affair to a long Uncer∣tainty, which neither the Nature of the Thing, nor the Oc∣casion that Subscribers had for their Money could admit of—; For it is to be observed by the Clause, That if the whole was not paid them within Twelve Months, they had
<PB N="160" REF="447"/>
Privilege to Trade, or give Licence to Trade, as if they were not to Dissolve at all.</P>
<P>Next after the <HI>African</HI> Company therefore the Publick Debts came to be considered, and the Equivalent was appro∣priated to the Discharge of the said Debts; And if the pre∣sent Sum fell short, it was to be made good out of the grow∣ing Customs and Revenue of <HI>Scotland,</HI> which for Seven Years was to be appropriate for such Uses, as will hereafter appear.</P>
<P>The next in order was to bestow this Money for the En∣couragement of Trade, and first the Wooll Masters as they are called, that is the Gentlemen whose Estates were in the Sheep Countries, and whose Rents were generally paid in Wooll, these made loud Complaints, that the Unions bringing upon them a Prohibition or Restraint of the Exportation of Wooll, and there being no Consumption by Manufacturing at Home, and their Wooll too course for Sale in <HI>England,</HI> their Estates would be visibly sunk, and therefore that they ought to have some <HI>Equivalent</HI> also.</P>
<P>To this it was alledged, That the Exportation of Wooll, however obtained lately in <HI>Scotland,</HI> yet was grievous to the whole Nation, and ought to be restrained by Law, as it was injurious to Trade, and that it used in former Times to be re∣strained; that therefore if this was a present Loss to them, it was nothing but a reducing them to what they were be∣fore, and taking away the Advantages they had made for a few Years out of the Publick Losses: But however, That all Parties might, as far as possible, be made sensible of the Equity and Justice of the Union, a Consideration of 2000 Pounds <HI>Sterling per Annum</HI> was allowed to encourage setting up such Manufactures in these places, as might imploy the Poor, and help forward the Consumption of the Wooll in the Countries where it is grown—; How this 2000 Pounds <HI>per Annum</HI> was disposed, and what Effect it had on the Wooll, or on the Trade, I may Examine hereafter.</P>
<P>A Remainder after this is allotted to the Fishing, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But the Issue of this also being not come to Knowledge at Writing of this History, I can give no further Account of it.</P>
<P>As to the Affair of the Coin and of the <HI>African</HI> Compa∣ny, the particulars were referr'd to the Committee, and we shall meet with them again in their Course, the Report of the said Committee being formed into an Act of Parliament, as will appear in its place—</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATION XLVIII.</HEAD>
<P>The Matter committed to the Committee here, was not whether the Coin should be reduc'd to the <HI>English</HI> Standart, and be alike all over the Island, for that every one seemed to agree to, especially after it had been agreed before, that the Desiciency should be made good out of the Equivalent—; But how, and in what manner the Deficiency of the Money should be made good, was the thing the Com∣mittee was to consider—; And here, con∣trary almost to the Hopes of the People, the Committee concluded, that the Deficiency even of the <HI>English</HI> Money, <HI>viz.</HI> One Penny in each Shilling should be made good.</P>
<P>But here was a great Difficulty, and that was this, if it should be Voted, that no Consideration should be given for the <HI>English</HI> Money, the People would be great Losers, and the Article of making good the Losses of the Coin would not be made good to them—; If the Deficiency was Voted, then the <HI>English</HI> would bring in vast Sums of Money upon them to receive the Deficiency, and have it out in current Money, and so carry it home again, and by this Trick, as some suggested, all the Equivalent might be exhausted.</P>
<P>But the Committee found a Cure for both these Evils to∣gether, 1. They resolved to make good the Deficiency of the <HI>English</HI> Money, <HI>that is,</HI> the <HI>English</HI> Silver Money, not the Guineas, and so all the Objections of that sort fell to the Ground; And to prevent the Possibility of bringing in any Quantity of Silver Money from <HI>England,</HI> they appointed all the <HI>English</HI> Money in the Nation to be brought in to certain places all in one Day, where the Sums being told, Sealed up, and laid by till no more was left to bring in, the Money was delivered back again the same day, with a Certification of the same, which entitled the Proprietor to the Deficiency to be paid out of the Equivalent.</P>
<P>Thus in one day all the <HI>English</HI> Money in the Kingdom, (<HI>viz.</HI> all the Silver Money) was reduc'd to the <HI>English</HI> Value, and went after that as in <HI>England,</HI> and for no more—; And as the Rate of Exchanges always attends the Intrinsick Value of the <HI>Specie,</HI> so the Exchanges, which before ran at Eleven or Twelve <HI>per Cent.</HI> to the Disadvantage of <HI>Scotland,</HI> immediately came to <HI>A PAR,</HI> and Money ran between <HI>Lon∣don</HI> and <HI>Edinburgh</HI> at a half <HI>per Cent.</HI> or at most one <HI>per Cent.</HI> sometimes this way, sometimes that way, as the Demand of Remitters and Drawers happened to alter the Case.</P>
<P>However the Proclamation mentioned in this Vote was con∣cealed, till the Time that all Things were ready for this Cal∣ling in the Money, that People might not have Notice of the Thing, and conscquently have Room to bring in Money from <HI>England;</HI> It was alledged nevertheless, That several conside∣rable
<PB N="163" REF="450"/>
Sums were brought over the Borders, but I never could understand, That it was proved; for the particulars, the Reader is referred to the Proclamation which contains the Report of the Committee, and shall come in its place.</P>
<P>The Seventeenth Article required no Debate at all, being what every Body acknowledged to be needful.</P>
<P>The Eighteenth Article was so well worded, and every Thing that related to <HI>Scotland</HI> so well provided for, that there was very little Room for Objection, and what was offered merits not to be remembred—; What was said re∣lating to the Laws, being made Alterable by the Parliament, amounted to nothing but just what had been Argued in <HI>Lon∣don</HI> at the Treaty; as for those that would have it out of the Power of subsequent Parliaments to alter any of the Laws, when they came to consider, that this was to Bar <HI>Scotland</HI> from having the advantage of a Legislature, and from what is Essential to all Government, <HI>viz.</HI> To have a Power in Beeing to make such Laws as they shall want, they presently Quitted a Notion so wild, remembring that Laws which are for the publick Good in one Age, may be directly otherwise in another; And to leave the Parliament no Power to Amend or Alter the Laws, would be to put <HI>Scotland</HI> in a worse Con∣dition than any Nation in the World, that when any part of Her Law became Grievous to Her, it could not, tho' at Her own Request, receive any Amendment; the Reasonableness therefore of its being always in the Power of subsequent Par∣liaments to Make or Amend Laws being granted, the Distinction of the Article admitted the less Debate, all things being to be done only to the <HI>evident Ʋtility of</HI> Scotland.</P>
<P>There was a second Attempt made here, with relation to Exempting the <HI>Scots</HI> from the Sacramental Test in <HI>England,</HI> but as it was just the same thing as is mentioned already in the Observation of <HI>November</HI> 12<HI>th.</HI> I need make no further Remark upon it, than this, That it was thrown by as a Thing in its self Impracticable, Unreasonable for the <HI>Scots</HI> Parlia∣ment to meddle with, and as offered only to Embarrass the present great Affair upon the Stage.</P>
<P>The Session or Term for Law-proceedings was now further to be Adjourned, and this was thought Necessary, not only because of the present Hurry the Nation was in, being Uni∣versally taken up about the great Affair of the Union; but it was thought some Advantages were designed against the Treaty, from the Confluence of People that from all Parts of the Kingdom, generally come together on this Occasion; and the Gentlemen who were for the Union, did not think it Safe to give such an Opportunity or Pretence, for the Coun∣trey to gather to <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> as that must of Necessity offer to them.</P>

<DIV2 N="49" TYPE="observation">
<HEAD>OBSERVATION XLIX.</HEAD>
<P>I have given the Reasons for Adjourning the Session in the last Observation; The Debates of this Day were only upon the Day to which it should be Adjourned, which are not Material, only to Note, That the Gentlemen against the U∣nion were always for the shortest Adjournment, which some said, was in hopes to get the Session to begin before the Parliament should end.</P>
<P>By the Nineteenth Article, the Court of Session, or as it is called, The Colledge of Justice, with the Court of Justiciary, are here effectually Established and Confirmed, their Being and Constitution can not be Touched, no not by the Parlia∣ment; They are indeed to submit to Regulations, and it can not but be Reasonable it should be so, but none of these Re∣gulations can affect them as a Court.</P>
<P>It may not be unnecessary, for the sake of the <HI>English</HI> Reader, to Explain the Terms in this Article, and to Describe the People mentioned here, by the like kind of Offices known in <HI>England,</HI> and to Note,<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That the Colledge of Justice, consists of the Lords of Session, Advocats, and Writers to the Signet; The Lords of the Session are a Bench of Judges, consisting of Fifteen, of whom one is Lord President of the Session, now possest by Sir <HI>Hugh Dal∣rymple</HI> Brother to the Earl of <HI>Stair</HI>—; These are Judges of all Causes of private Right, like as the Court of <HI>Queens Bench</HI> and <HI>Common Pleas,</HI> from whom Ap∣peals lay before the Parliament, called <HI>Petitions for Remeid of Law;</HI> Their Sallary was Two Hundred Pound <HI>per Annum,</HI> but is now since the Union Five Hundred Pound.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The Court of Justiciary is a Criminal Court, con∣sisting of Five Judges, who are called, <HI>The Lords of Justiciary,</HI> of whom the Earl of <HI>Cromerty</HI> is President or Chief, and is called, <HI>Justice General.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>Advocats here, are Lawyers, such as the Counsellors at Law in <HI>England,</HI> who Plead before the Lords of the Session, (the Judges) and give Advice, take Fees, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as the Connsellors of the Inns of Court in <HI>England.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>Writers are something like Attorneys, who prosecute Law Suits, and prepare Things in due Form for Trials at the Bar.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Writers to the Signet, are a Select Number of those by whom all Processes must be Signed, before they can go on in Form.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="453"/>
It was the Subject of no small Debate here, Whether any Writer should be capable of being Lord of the Session, or Advocats or Counsellors only; It had been alledged, that it was Dishonourable to the Bench of Judges, to raise any of the Writers, which are a lower Rank of Practitioners, to the Dignity of a Lord of the Session; That it was Advancing them over the Heads of the Advocats, that in <HI>England</HI> no Man arrives to the Dignity of a Judge, till he is first received within the Bar, <HI>That is,</HI> made a Serjeant; and that till now, Writers were not Admitted.</P>
<P>The first Motion was even against Advocates or Clerks of the Session too, <HI>till they had served a certain Number of Years as Advocats;</HI> but the Writers finding themselves ex∣cluded by that Vote, got it added after a long Debate.</P>
<P>It remained then to Determine, what Writers should be Qualified, and which Excluded; but as this Debate seem∣ed something of a Surprize to the Parliament, and the whole Faculty seemed concerned in it, it was put off to the next day—; The Debate seemed of no great Concern to the Publick, but as it affected private Persons, whose Interest was at that time strong in the Parliament, it occasioned warm Debates.</P>

<P>Then the Parliament resumed the Consideration of the Debate anent the Qualification of Writers to the Signet, before they can be named ordinary Lords of Session: And after some further Debate as to the time they are to serve as Writers, before they can be ca∣pable to be named Lords, there were two States of a Vote offered; the first in these Terms, <HI>Whether they shall serve Twenty Years,</HI> or <HI>none,</HI> and the second in these Terms, <HI>Whether they are to serve Eight or Ten Years;</HI> And after some Reasoning, which of the two should be the State of the Vote, <HI>First</HI> or <HI>Second,</HI></P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>Abercorn</HI> gave in a Protest against the first State of the Vote in these Terms: <Q REND="inline">"I Protest against the stating of the first Vote, because, which way soever it may be carried, it, in my humble Opinion, elides one of the two Votes past Yesterday, re∣lating to the Additional Clause; for, if it should be carried, That a Writer to the Signet may be admitted to be an ordinary Lord of the Session, without limiting a reasonable Time for Qualifying himself by Experience, as to the Practical Part of the Law, then that seems to be inconsistent with the Vote, requiring Advocats
<PB N="167" REF="454"/>
undergoing a Five Years Probation at the Bar: On the other Hand, if the Vote should be carried for a Writers being Twenty Years in that Station, before being capable to be named by the Sovereign to be an ordinary Lord of the Session, that seems to be Tantamount to an absolute Exclusion of Writers from the sad Office,</Q> and thereupon he took Instruments.</P>
<P>Then the Vote was put, <HI>First,</HI> or <HI>Second;</HI> and it carried, <HI>Second.</HI> Thereafter the Vote was put, <HI>Eight,</HI> or <HI>Ten Years,</HI> and it carried, <HI>Ten Years.</HI></P>
<P>Then a Motion was made for an Additional Clause, in relation to the Qualification of Writers in these Terms, <Q REND="inline">"With this Provi∣sion, That no Writer to the Signet be capable to be admitted a Lord of the Session, unless he undergo a private and publick Try∣al on the Civil Law, before the Faculty of Advocats, and be found by them Qualified for the above-said Office, Two Years be∣fore they shall be named to be a Lord of the Session:</Q> And after Reasoning thereon, the Vote was stated, <HI>Add the Clause,</HI> or <HI>not.</HI></P>
<P>But before Voting, it was Moved, <Q REND="inline">"That the Qualifications made or to be made, for Capacitating Persons to be named ordi∣nary Lords of Session, shall be Alterable by the Parliament of Great-Britain;</Q> And after Debate, it was put to the Vote, <HI>Alte∣rable</HI> or not, and it carried, <HI>Alterable.</HI></P>
<P>Then the Vote was put, <HI>Add the Clause in relation to the Qualifi∣cation of Writers,</HI> and it carried, <HI>Add.</HI></P>
<P>Thereafter the second Clause of the Nineteenth Article of Union in relation to the Courts of Justiciary, was read, and agreed to.</P>
<P>And the third Clause in relation to the Admiralty, was also read, and agreed to.</P>
<P>Thereafter the other Clauses of the said Nineteenth Article, in relation to the Court of Exchequer and other Courts, and also the Remainder of the Article was read, and agreed to.</P>
<P>Then the Vote was put, <HI>Approve of the Nineteenth Article as amend∣ed,</HI> or <HI>not,</HI> and it carried, <HI>Approve.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Adjourned till to Morrow at Ten of the Clock.</HI></P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATION L.</HEAD>
<P>There needs little to be said of this Days Work, our last Observation having stated the Case, and the Vote it self be∣ing more particular than ordinary in that Matter.</P>
<P>The Writers to the Signet were admitted to be made or∣dinary Lords of the Session, upon Conditions and Qualifica∣tions as by the Minute, <HI>viz.</HI> Ten Years Continuance as Writer, and Two Years afterward passing a Tryal before the Advocats.</P>
<P>But it may not be Unnecessary to Note, That all this De∣bate had some Ground for it that did not yet appear, and some personal Views were in it on either Hand; The latter, it can be of no use to meddle with here, but the Reasons in general of this Debate were, to foreclose the admitting Per∣sons
<PB N="178" REF="455"/>
to be Judges, who had not been bred to the Law, a Thing really Significant in it self, and which some alledged had been but too much practised, in <HI>Scotland,</HI> to the great prejudice of the College of Justice in general, the Injury of the Gentlemen who were bred up to the Study of, and had run thro' long Practice in the Law, and not over much to the Reputation of the whole Session in general—; It was said also, That there were Views of this sort at this time, and that much of the Debate was founded upon that Head, but this I will not affirm, it is certain, the Lawyers made no small Struggle in the Case of Qualifications on both Sides—; The People generally seemed very well pleased with the Limitations, as what seemed very much to regard the Repu∣tation of the Law, and be some Security for the time to come, that such as shall be advanced to be Judges of the Law, shall be chosen from among those who best understand the Law—; At last the Debate seemed to meet with some Interruption on the Account of submitting these Qualificati∣ons to the Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain</HI>—; This was op∣posed by several sorts of People; and it may be noted, some were for submitting this to such Alteration, which were very warm against submitting other things—; Their Reasons were plain to the Persons concerned, but being of no publick Consequence to Record those things, I leave them to the Ob∣servation of the respective Parties.</P>
<P>It was at last settled, as <HI>per</HI> the Vote, alterable by the <HI>Bri∣tish</HI> Parliament; And I cannot but note, That those Gentle∣men, who expect the Limitations, shall be enlarged by a <HI>Bri∣tish</HI> Parliament, and were, on that Account, forward to sub∣ject it to such Alteration, may very probably be disappoint∣ed, Parliaments in <HI>England</HI> having on all Occasions, showen themselves forward to secure a Succession of able and well Qualified Persons to be Judges in <HI>England,</HI> and will no doubt be careful of the same in <HI>Scotland,</HI> when ever that case shall come before them.</P>

whether out of the Malt or out of the Liquor; and a Petition given in for the Brewers of <HI>Dundee</HI> against the said Act was Read; and another Clause was offered to be added to the said Act, in fa∣vours of Mr. <HI>James Anderson,</HI> in these Terms, <HI>With this Provision, as it is hereby expresly provided and declared, That the said Imposition is, and shall be burdened with the Sum of twelve hundred Pounds yearly, for the space of six Years. to be payed to Mr.</HI> James Anderson <HI>Writer to the Signet, or his Assigneys, as a part of the Expenses of the Work re∣commended to him by the Parliament, and that at two Terms in the Year,</HI> Martinmass <HI>and</HI> Whitsunday, <HI>beginning the first Terms Payment at</HI> Martinmass 1707 <HI>Years; And ordains the Magistrates of the said Burgh to make payment of the same accordingly;</HI> Which being Read, it was agreed to add the said Clause; and after further Reasoning on the said Act, several other Amendments were made thereupon, and after Debate on the above Petition for the Brewers, and Clause in relation to the Management, it was put to the Vote, <HI>Approve of the Act as amended, or add the Clause.</HI> and it carried, <HI>Approve.</HI></P>

<P>This was a Day for private Business, and I should have wholly Omitted the Minute of it, but on the following Occa∣sion—.</P>
<P>First, to Note how the Parliament of <HI>Scotland,</HI> on all Oc∣casions, Encouraged Learning and Industry, and particularly the Labours and Study of Mr. <HI>James Anderson,</HI> a Gentleman bred to the Study of the Laws of <HI>Scotland,</HI> but by his own In∣clination led into that Painful, but most Excellent and use∣full
<PB N="171" REF="458"/>
Study of Antiquity—; In the prosecution of which, he had begun a most Tedious and Chargeable Work in Search after the Antiquities of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and had formarly laid before them the Specimens he had made of that Work, which met with a General Approbation, and the Reward allotted him for it, shews the sense the House had of the Greatness of the Undertaking, which if that Gentleman live to Finish, it may let the world know, their Money was not ill bestowed.</P>
<P>The Naturalizing Monsieur <HI>Huguetan</HI> was a Thing lay open to some Reflections, and at first look'd meanly enough; The Man was fled from <HI>France,</HI> and as was said, had De∣frauded the King of <HI>France,</HI> and private Persons also, of great Sums of Money, and finding himself unsafe in <HI>England,</HI> where a Commission of Bankrupt had been attempted to be Sued out—, he sought Protection here.</P>
<P>However the Parliament consented to the Naturalization—, but Limited and Restricted the Protection he sought with such just and reasonable Clauses, as that Monsieur <HI>Hugue∣tan</HI> never thought fit to take the Benefit of it, but went away to <HI>Holland,</HI> where, what became of him, how he was near being Trapann'd away into <HI>France,</HI> where his Fate had been most certain; How the States General resented the Attempt, and punished the Persons, tho', at the same time, they did it in Respect to their own Jurisdictions and Con∣stitution, rather than in respect to the Person—; How afterward he was Marryed to Madamoisell <HI>D'Odyke,</HI> in spite of all the Opposition made by Monsieur <HI>D'Auverkirke</HI> her near Relation, and Velt Mareschal of the Forces of the States; These things, as not material to this History, I shall take no notice of, and only mention the other, to let the World see, That, tho' the Enemies of <HI>Scotland</HI> loudly clamoured, that, for the sake of bringing Money thither, they would make themselves the Sanctuary of the most Infamous Persons; yet, that upon the Application of this Man, they clogg'd the Fa∣vour they bestowed with such just Clauses in Relief of the Claims of private Persons, that, if the Person sought any Sanctuary against his just Debts, he found it was not to be had in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and therefore he was so far intirely dis∣appointed. As to his publick Affair with the Government in <HI>France,</HI> it did not appear other than by Report, and no publick Body could be obliged to provide against any thing that they had no Documents to prove, and which no Body appeared to accuse him of.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATION LII.</HEAD>
<P>The Affair of the Courts of Admiralty and Exchequer, need very little Remark, they were by the Nineteenth Ar∣ticle reserved, and their distinct Powers are very expresly stated in the Article it self, nor did it occasion any great De∣bate in the Parliament; for those Debates which were raised upon a supposition of the Union taking place, it was obser∣ved, gave the House the least Trouble—, which I take to be a further proof, that the main Design in Opposing and Debating the Particulars, was, as they pointed at the Gene∣ral, and it was therefore a just Observation, that any Head of Argument became more or less vigoursly opposed, as it, more or less pushed at the Union in General.</P>
<P>The Office of the Lord high Admiral for all <HI>Britain,</HI> it was absolutely necessary to reduce to one—; But the Courts of Admiralty having their several Jurisdictions &amp; Authorities were as necessary as several private Rights, which by the next Article were to be reserved, depending intirely upon it.</P>
<P>The heretable Rights of Admiralty, &amp; the Vice Admiralties, were also necessary to be supported; and all these Things made it absolutely necessary to preserve a Court of Admiralty, the Tryals being to be had in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and which by the Constitution and Laws of <HI>Scotland,</HI> reserved as before, could not be legally Transferred to, or taken Cognizance of by the Court of Admiralty of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The like in the Affair of the Exchequer, where, if the Seizures of the Customs, if private Rights and Debates between the Queen and Subject, could not have been Tryed in <HI>Scotland,</HI> the General Reserve of the Laws to <HI>Scotland;</HI> could not have been maintained, and the Subject would have been put to in∣tolerable Inconveniencies and Expences in Pursuing and De∣fending in all Pleas of the Crown, or Cases between the Queen and Her Subjects.</P>
<P>These Things therefore admitted of very little Debate, but were regulated by the Methods required by the Customs and Forms of Law, and then past as it were in course.</P>
<P>The Affair of the Privy Council was also left to its own Fate, the Story of which I omit here, because it will come necessarly to be spoken of in the subsequent part of this
<PB N="174" REF="461"/>
History, when it was Deposed with some Struggle, and as some thought, a little sooner than was needful.</P>
<P>The present Article, which I take to be a very Extensive one, had passed, and been in all its parts Unexceptionable, had not one unhappy Word been brought in, and this was the word <HI>SƲPERIORITIES;</HI> But this being added without any Condition or Power left in Parliament to Dissolve those Superiorities, upon an Equivalent to the Owners, whenever the United Parliament should find Occasion for the publick Good to do so; has bound down <HI>Scotland</HI> to the private Tyrrany and Oppression of the Heretors and Lairds, which it is easie to make appear, is at this Time one of the greatest Obstructions to Her Peace and Prosperity.</P>
<P>The Superiorities meant here, are the Rights of Vassalage which the Gentry of <HI>Scotland</HI> have over the People, which, as it is Extended, gives the Chiefs and Heads of Clans, Lairds and Heretors, such an absolute Dominion over both the Per∣sons and Goods of the poor subjected People, as seems per∣fectly inconsistent both with the Peace and the Improvement of <HI>Scotland</HI> in particular, or of any Free Nation in General, and this two ways.</P>
<P N="1">1. As it gives too great a Power to particular persons, who are thereby rendred Independent of the Law, and put in too easie a Condition to Insult the Government, and break the publick Peace; Instances of which have been given since the Union, as shall particularly appear in the Process of this History, where Persons by the Assistance of their Tenantry, and the Dominion of their own Superiorities, protected them∣selves from the publick Justice, and bid Defiance to the just Resentments and Suspicions of the Government, even in a Time of <HI>French</HI> Invasion—. That a Power to put any one in such a posture, is inconsistent with the publick peace; I need not spend Time here to Dispute, and <HI>Scotland</HI> may have, and I doubt will have occasion to acknowledge.</P>
<P N="2">2. As it keeps the Common People and Tenantry of <HI>Scot∣land</HI> in a Condition inconsistent with the Liberty of a Free Nation, and under an intolerable Slavery to their Landlords, by which they are effectually prevented either Improving their Stocks for themselves, or their Lands for their Landlords;—, which the Landlord himself effectually prevents, by his absolutely Ruining and Devouring their Industry at his own will.</P>
<P>This Subject is too long for the Extent of a single Obser∣vation, and will be more particularly spoken to in its place; but I note it here as the proper Subject of the place, this be∣ing the Day when it was introduc'd into the Treaty, and had only this Unhappiness, that it came in, as it were, by Head and Shoulders, without any previous Conditionary Clause—; I do not alledge, That the Superiorities of the Gen∣try
<PB N="175" REF="462"/>
should have been taken away by Law, without Satisfacti∣on made to the private Estates of those, from whom they should have been taken, farther is it yet from me to say, or think, they should be surrendered to the Crown—; But certainly had it been left to a Parliament of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> to have Dissolved them upon any just Occasion, and, by Land or Money, have made a full Recompence to the Pro∣prietors, and so have broken that Bond of Slavery by which <HI>Scotland</HI> has been so long suppress'd, and the Poor kept Poor, their Industry discouraged, and their Labour devoured; From that Day the Nation had dated its Liberty and Pros∣perity; Plenty, and Encouragement to Trade and Manu∣factures must have followed, since no People can be supposed to Work cheerfully, when they cannot enjoy what they gain, or call it their own.</P>
<P>But this was a Time of Hurry, and People could not look about them as at other Times; Nor was the Liberty of the poor People so near in View, as to move that Concern in Mens minds, which perhaps were it now to be done, might be otherwise; Whether this or the Fate of <HI>Scotland,</HI> I shall not Determine as the Cause of the Omission—. But 'tis evi∣dent, The Thing is <HI>Ʋnhappily for Scotland,</HI> Omitted; And the great Opportunity of extending the Love of Liberty, as well as the Taste of it, to all the People Irrecoverably Lost.</P>
<P>The Rights of the Burghs came next to be Debated, the whole Rights of the Burrows were reserved to them by the Union; Nor was any Thing offered now to Abridge those Rights, yet it was thought, it both might be the Advantage of the Burrows, and of the Nation in General, to have those Rights subjected to Parliamentary Regulations, but some People took an Alarm at this, as if the Parliament in time coming, would take away the Privileges of the Royal Bur∣rows; and thus in this particular Time of Jealousie, the great Advantages which both the Burghs of <HI>Scotland</HI> in particular, and the People of <HI>Scotland</HI> in General, might have had from Parliamentary Regulations, were lost and Foreclosed, and the Door Barr'd against any future Alterations to be made by Parliament, were they never so much to the Advan∣tage and Benefit of the respective Parts.</P>
<P>The next Thing brought upon the Stage, was the Num∣ber and Manner of Electing the Representative, it had been moved in the Debates of the Third Article, but was pur∣posely Adjourned to this, as the proper Time of entring upon it—. It was too long an Affair to begin at the end of the Day; so it was Adjourned to the next <HI>Sederunt,</HI> when it took up Time enough.</P>

<P>Likeas, a Fifth Protest was given in by the Earl of <HI>Errol,</HI> in these Terms, <HI>I</HI> Charles <HI>Earl of</HI> Errol, <HI>Lord High Constable of</HI> Scot∣land, <HI>do hereby Protest, That the Office of High Constable of</HI> Scotland, <HI>with all the Rights and Privileges of the same, belonging to me Here∣tably, and depending upon the Monarchy, Sovereignty, and Antient Constitution of this Kingdom, may not be weakened nor prejudged by the Conclusion of the Treaty of Ʋnion betwixt</HI> Scotland <HI>and</HI> England, <HI>nor any Article, Clause or Condition thereof, but that the said Heretable Of∣fice, with all the Rights and Privileges thereof, may continue and remain to me, and my Successors, intire and unhurt by any Votes or Acts of Par∣liament, or other Proceedings whatsoever relative to the said Ʋnion: And I crave this my Protestation may be Admitted and Recorded in the Registers and Rolls of Parliament.</HI></P>
<P>And a Sixth Protest was given in by the Earl <HI>Marischal</HI> in these Terms, <HI>I</HI> William <HI>Earl</HI> Marischal, <HI>do hereby Protest, That whatever is contained in any Article of the Treaty of Ʋnion betwixt</HI> Scotland <HI>and</HI> England, <HI>shall no manner of way derogate from, or be prejudicial to me, or my Successors, in our Heretable Office of Great Marischal of</HI> Scotland <HI>in all time coming, or in the full and free Enjoyment and Exercise of the baill Rights, Dignities, Titles, Honours, Powers and Privileges thereto belonging, which my Ancestors and I have Possessed and Exercised as Rights of Property these Seven Hundred Years.

<P>Which Protestations being read, the several Protesters took In∣struments upon their respective Protests.</P>
<P>And it was agreed, That the Members Votes be marked, and that a List of their Names, as they shall Vote, be Printed and Re∣corded,
<PB N="177" REF="464"/>
and that, at calling the Rolls, the Adherers to the above respective Protests be marked; As also, the Lord Chancellor was allowed to have his Name Marked, Printed and Recorded as an Approver.</P>
<P>Then the Vote was put, <HI>Approve the first Paragraph of the Twenty Second Article of Ʋnion,</HI> or <HI>Not;</HI> and it carried, <HI>Approve.</HI> And the Earl of <HI>Caithness,</HI> the Viscount of <HI>Stormount,</HI> the Lords <HI>Oliphant, Balmerino, Bargany</HI> and <HI>Kinnaird, John Brisbane</HI> younger of <HI>Bishop∣toun,</HI> Sir <HI>Humphrey Colquhoun</HI> of <HI>Luss,</HI> Sir <HI>Patrick Murray</HI> of <HI>Anchter∣tyre, John Murray</HI> of <HI>Strowan, James Ogilvie</HI> younger of <HI>Boyne, Ale∣xander Macky</HI> of <HI>Palgown, James Sinclair</HI> of <HI>Stempster, Alexander Robertson, Alexander Duff, Francis Molison, Robert Scot, Archibald Sheils,</HI> Mr. <HI>John Lyon,</HI> Mr. <HI>John Carruthers, George Home, John Bayne,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Robert Frazer,</HI> Adhered to the Duke of <HI>Atholes</HI> Protest; and <HI>Andrew Fletcher</HI> of <HI>Saltoun,</HI> Sir <HI>Robert Sinclair</HI> of <HI>Longformacus,</HI> Sir <HI>Hugh Cathcart</HI> of <HI>Carletoun,</HI> the said <HI>John Brisbane</HI> younger of <HI>Bishoptoun,</HI> Mr. <HI>William Cochran</HI> of <HI>Kilmaronock,</HI> Sir <HI>Humphrey Col∣quhoun</HI> of <HI>Luss, Robert Rollo</HI> of <HI>Powhouse,</HI> Mr. <HI>James Carnagie</HI> of <HI>Phin∣haven, David Graham</HI> of <HI>Fintrie,</HI> and the said <HI>James Sinclair</HI> of <HI>Stempster,</HI> Adhered to <HI>George Lockhart</HI> of <HI>Carnwaths</HI> Protest; and the Earls of <HI>Crawfurd</HI> and <HI>Galloway</HI> Adhered to the Earl of <HI>Buchans</HI> Protest.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATION LIII.</HEAD>
<P>The Affair of the Number of the Representative, whether of the Nobility or Commons, was the Contents of the first Pa∣ragraph now debated; How, and with what Difficulty, this part of the Equality was settled in <HI>England,</HI> has been noted al∣ready, and the Reasonableness of the Proportion duly stated there.</P>
<P>It was indeed urged again here, and several ways disput∣ed, but the Disputes here seemed to look another way; And first it was vigorously opposed, That <HI>Scotland</HI> should come to any Representative at all; That her whole Parliament should sit in Conjunction with the <HI>English</HI> Parliament, and long Speeches were made on that Head; Some alledging, That it was Dishonourable to <HI>Scotland</HI> to lessen the Number of her Representative, while <HI>England</HI> retained her intire Parlia∣ment; Others again attempted to argue against the very Uniting of the Parliament at all, tho' that was foreclosed by the first Vote pass'd on the Third Article—. 3. Others yet went into the Merit of the Cause, and to Examine the just Propor∣tion of the Representative, and these objected very vigorously, that the Numbers were not equal—; The Opinions were variously divided, as to the Foundation of a true Equality, upon what Principle an Equality of Proportions could be raised—; Some stating the Numbers of People to be the Test of the Repre∣sentative; others the Proportion of Taxes, some an Estimate from both; others alledged, there could be no just Rule laid down, how an equal Proportion of Representatives could be made, to ballance a Kingdom that is not <HI>IT SELF</HI> equally represented, and that before <HI>England</HI> had required <HI>Scotland</HI> to reduce their Re∣presentative to a just Proportion <HI>to her,</HI> she ought to have reduced her own Representative to a just Proportion to her self, either in Number of People, or Payment of Taxes, neither of which, <HI>as they alledged,</HI> were at all regarded in the <HI>English</HI> Representa∣tive; That it was the Complaint in <HI>England,</HI> and several had wrote very warmly upon that Subject, that their Taxes were not equally Levyed, or their People equally Represented; and it was unreasonable to talk of proportioning <HI>Scotland</HI> to a Country, whose Representative was not in its self equal.</P>
<P>There were several Answers given to this, the present Cir∣cumstances of both Nations in general seemed to be the tru∣est Foundation of a Proportion, wherein, tho' the particular Towns in <HI>England</HI> might not be justly proportioned, yet the general might be equal, and thus, without enquiring, whe∣ther
<PB N="179" REF="466"/>
the parts of the Representative were equally chosen in <HI>England,</HI> it might be a just Proportion, in having the whole brought to a State; And if the Number for <HI>Scotland</HI> bare the same Proportion to the Number for <HI>England,</HI> as the Num∣bers of People, and Wealth or Payment of Taxes, joyntly considered, of the one part bare to the same Articles in the other, the Equality was then preserved—.</P>
<P>It was remembred, That this had been fully debated in <HI>England,</HI> and that the Number was brought up to the high∣est Proportion that <HI>England</HI> could possibly grant—; Mr. <HI>Seton,</HI> in his Speech printed in the Minutes herewith, <HI>Folio</HI> 79<HI>th,</HI> declared, it was above what <HI>Scotland</HI> ought to ex∣pect, and that it was a full Proportion. Upon the whole, this first Clause was put to the Vote, and passed by it self.</P>
<P>The Scruples on the second Paragraph, as principally re∣lating to the Manner of Issuing out the Writs for Electing the Members, when they should be Chosen for the Parliament of <HI>Britain,</HI> I take no notice of here, referring that to the Time, when a separate Act came to be debated in the House for the said Election.

<P>And after Reasoning, the Lord <HI>Balmerino</HI> gave in a Protest against that given in the former <HI>Sederunt</HI> by the Earl of <HI>Marchmount,</HI> and took Instruments thereupon; And the Duke of <HI>Hamilton,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Ashole,</HI> the Earls of <HI>Errol, Marischal, Buchan, Eglington, Wigton, Galloway</HI> and <HI>Selkirk,</HI> the Viscounts of <HI>Stormount</HI> and <HI>Kilsyth,</HI> the Lords <HI>Semple, Oliphant, Blantyre, Bargany</HI> and <HI>Kinnaird, George Lockhart</HI> of <HI>Carnwath, Andrew Fletcher</HI> of <HI>Saltoun,</HI> Mr. <HI>William Cochran</HI> of <HI>Kilmaronock,</HI> Sir <HI>Humphray Colquhoun</HI> of <HI>Luss, Robert Rollo</HI> of <HI>Powhouse, John Murray</HI> of <HI>Strowan,</HI> Mr. <HI>James Carnagie</HI> of <HI>Phinhaven, David Grahame</HI> younger of <HI>Fintrie, Alexander Mackye</HI> of <HI>Palgown, Alexander Edgar, Alexander Duff, Francis Molison, Archibald Shiels,</HI>

Mr. <HI>John Lyon,</HI> Mr. <HI>John Carruthers, George Home</HI> and Mr. <HI>Robert Frazer</HI> adhered thereto.</P>
<P>And after some further Debate, it was agreed, that none of the above Protests be insert at length in the Minutes, or printed, but that they be all Recorded and insert in the Records of Parlia∣ment.</P>
<P>Then the third Paragraph of the twenty second Article of Union, beginning thus; <HI>And if Her Majesty on or before the first day of</HI> May <HI>next,</HI> &amp;c. and ending with these Words: <HI>And that Parliaments may continue for such time only as the present Parliament of</HI> England <HI>might have continued if the Ʋnion of the two Kingdoms had not been made, unless sooner dissolved by Her Majesty,</HI> was read.</P>
<P>And after reasoning thereon, it was moved to add the following Clause thereto, viz. <HI>And that the said Parliament of</HI> Great Britain <HI>shall meet and sit once in three years, at least, in that part of</HI> Great-Britain <HI>now called</HI> Scotland.</P>
<P>And after further Debate, there were two States of a Vote offered, the first in these Terms; <HI>Approve the third Paragraph of the twenty second Article,</HI> or <HI>not:</HI> And the second in these Terms, <HI>Add the above Clause,</HI> or <HI>not;</HI> And after Reasoning which should be the state of the Vote, it was put to the Vote, <HI>First,</HI> or <HI>Second.</HI></P>
<P>And it was agreed, That the Members Votes shall be marked; and that the List of their Names as they Vote be Printed and Re∣corded, and the Lord Chancellor was allowed to have his Name Printed and Recorded as a Voter for the first State, and if that shall carry, as Voting among the Approvers.</P>
<P>Then the Vote was put, <HI>First,</HI> or <HI>Second,</HI> and it carried <HI>First:</HI> Thereafter the Vote was put, <HI>Approve the third Paragraph of the twenty second Article,</HI> or <HI>not;</HI> and it carried <HI>Approve.</HI></P>
<P>Then the rest of the twenty second Article of Union was read, and after some Reasoning and reading of the Oaths to which it re∣lates: An Overture was given in for an additional Clause for ex∣plaining the Word <HI>Limitation</HI> mentioned in the Oath appointed to be taken by <HI>Statute</HI> 13. <HI>W.</HI> 3. <HI>Cap.</HI> 6.</P>
<P>And another Overture was given in, for exeeming persons in any Office or Imployments in <HI>Scotland,</HI> from taking the Oath of Abju∣ration mentioned in the said Article.</P>
<P>And a third Overture for a Clause, <HI>That so long as the Act appoint∣ing a Sacramental Test shall continue in force in</HI> England, <HI>all persons in publick Trust within the Limits of</HI> Scotland, <HI>shall swear and sign a</HI> For∣mula <HI>thereto subjoyned, in manner and under the penalties therein mentioned.</HI></P>
<P>And after reading the said three Overtures, and Reasoning there∣on, a Vote was stated; <HI>Approve of the twenty second Article of Ʋnion as explained,</HI> or <HI>not.</HI></P>
<P>But before Voting it was agreed, That notwithstanding of the said Vote, and that the Article shall be thereby approven, it shall nevertheless be intire and free thereafter to proceed on the saids

<P>The Debate about the Protestations of the Four Gentle∣men above-mentioned, ended now, after some Heat, in Or∣dering the Protestations to be Recorded and Enrolled in the Registers of Parliament, which satisfied all Parties.</P>
<P>It was very much enquired after, Why these Protestations should not be made publick, since the Gentlemen that made them, did not concern themselves to Conceal them; Some alledged, The Parliament behoved to enter into a Confutati∣on of the Matter of the Protests, if they made them publick, and either to Approve or Censure them: Others thought, The publishing them might do Harm among the people; and that since the Parliament were now just at the End of the Work, it was better to keep them all Easie, than start any new Dispute. So the Protests were not published, but En∣tered in the Rolls or Registers Office of the Kingdom of <HI>Scot∣land</HI>—, from whence the true Copies of them are taken, and added in the <HI>Appendix</HI> to this Work N<SUP>o.</SUP> <HI>L. M. N. O.</HI></P>
<P>Then they went upon the Debate of Triennial Parlia∣ments, included in the Third Paragraph of the Twenty Se∣cond Article—, and some were very Urgent for a new Clause, as in the Minute—; But when the Gentlemen were put in mind, That by the very Words of the Paragraph, it was expresly provided, That the First Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> could sit no longer than the next ensuing Session, being the Termination of the <HI>English</HI> Parliament then in Beeing, and that by the Act then in Force in <HI>England,</HI> called <HI>The Triennial Act,</HI> every Parliament was to Terminate in Three Years; The Thing appeared already settled, and so admitted no further Debate, that Law being among others, continued by the Twenty Fifth Article; Of which in its or∣der.</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="470"/>
It was very strange, that notwithstanding the Debates of this Day, and the express Provision of the Treaty many People flattered themselves with the Notion of the Parliaments con∣tinuing to sit, nor could it be beaten out of their Thoughts in <HI>England</HI> as well as in <HI>Scotland,</HI> till they saw the very Prepa∣rations making for a new Election.</P>
<P>The Proposal for Explaining the several Oaths to be taken by the Members of the <HI>British</HI> Parliament, was Opposed, not that there could be any concealed Oath, that was not known to the Members—; And the particular Oaths of Allegiance, the Declaration, and Abjuration were laid before the House—, but the Gentlemen who thought fit to Op∣pose it, did it on this Foot, That they thought the Articles so expresly directed to the particular Acts in which the said Oaths were contain'd, and in which no other Oaths were ex∣pressed, that the Acts being named at large, and referred to, And the Custom and Usage of Parliament known, and pub∣lick, there could be no possible Fraud, Mistake, or Miscon∣struction, but that it was this way as expresly and directly pointed out, as if it had been Repeated in the Articles, Word for Word.</P>
<P>The Exception about the <HI>Limitation,</HI> mentioned in the 13. <HI>William</HI> III. <HI>Cap.</HI> 6. referring to the Qualification of the Successors to the Crown, also will come to be spoken to again in its place.</P>
<P>The Overture about the Qualification of Persons to Of∣fices of Trust, has been spoken to more than once already, and needs no further Observation at this Time.</P>

<P>This whole Day was taken up in debating the Subject of the Word <HI>Limitation,</HI> mentioned in that Famous Act of 13<HI>th W.</HI> 3. in <HI>England</HI>—; Some had alledged, That, by that Act, if any Person took upon him the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> un∣qualified by any of the Articles therein-named, the Allegiance
<PB N="185" REF="472"/>
Sworn was not due, and that the Subject would be thereby obliged, by his Oath, to oppose such Successor; Others had declared the Limitations to mean nothing but an Entail of the Succession by Parliament, without any Conditions of Go∣vernment; and upon these seeming Uncertainties, the Per∣sons that moved this Clause demanded an Explanation; but it was, upon the whole, not thought proper to undertake any Explanation of an Act, which, as it stood, seemed suffi∣cient to settle the Protestant Succession, and could not hurt the present Scheme, since, so far as it might oppose any Branch of the Union, it was provided against in the Twenty Fifth Article; And to put any Construction upon it, which might be inconsistent with the <HI>English</HI> Affairs, would be but to lay a Stumbling Block in the way of the Union, and there∣fore this Project was also rejected.</P>
<P>The Affair of the Sacramental Test had been mentioned before, but never so plainly moved in Parliament as now; It had been moved in the Commission of the Assembly, and great Endeavours had been used, to bring the Ministers in, as Ob∣jectors, and a <HI>Formula</HI> like this had been proposed there, as is noted already, but it failed on their side; The Ministers were, in the first place, not willing to meddle with Things of that Nature; And, secondly, As to the <HI>Formula,</HI> many of the Ministers gave their Opinion, That they did not ap∣prove of Imposing any Oath, or Acknowledgment of the Church, as a Test of Civil Imployment; And, to have an Oath of Acknowledgment to the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> be a Counter Test, was a Tacit Approbation of the Method practi∣sed in <HI>England,</HI> which they detested.</P>
<P>Others again were of the Opinion, That the Subjects of <HI>Scotland</HI> were already, by the Union, Exempted from the Sacramental Test in <HI>England</HI> by two several Clauses—; 1. In that the Subjects of both Kingdoms were, by the Fourth Article of the Union, to enjoy equal Privileges and Encou∣ragements—; And, 2. That, by the Adam for the Security of the Church Government, no Oath was to be Imposed upon the Members of the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> con∣trary to their Principles—; In arguing the first of these, it was alledged, That, <HI>if a Subject of</HI> Scotland <HI>taking the Sa∣crament in the National Establish'd Church of</HI> Scotland, <HI>shall not be capable of any Place of Preferment under the Government of</HI> Bri∣tain, <HI>as well as a Subject of</HI> England <HI>taking the Sacrament in the National Establish'd Church of</HI> England; Then, do not the Sub∣jects of either Kingdom enjoy <HI>Equal Privileges</HI>—; And last∣ly it was argued, That, by the last Article of the Treaty, the Sacramental Test might be understood to be actually Repeal∣ed, as Contraveening the Equalities of the Treaty.</P>
<P>Upon these Debates it was thought, That, to meddle with this Matter, might do much more Harm than Good; And
<PB N="186" REF="473"/>
therefore, it was first let fall without Doors, and now reject∣ed within, and the Article pass'd without it.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATION LVII.</HEAD>
<P>The Debates of this Day related wholly to the Privileges of the Peers, and particularly to the differing Privileges
<PB N="187" REF="474"/>
of those who were to sit in the Parliament of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> from those who were not, <HI>i. e.</HI> for the time they were to sit; Some would have had it, That those that did not sit, should have no manner of Privilege, any more than as a Common∣er, till such time as they should come to sit by Election in the House of Lords, and then those that were formerly sitting Peers, or Parliament Lords, became divested of all their Pri∣vileges, unless they were of the New Election—; Some thought, the Gentlemen, who were of this Opinion, moved it chiefly, to bring the Peers into a Distaste of the Union, (all other Hopes being now almost over, as to the Union on the Side of <HI>Scotland</HI>)—; And that the Nobility being thereby, as it were, degraded of their Characters, would think it too great a Hardship, and so fly off from the Treaty in general, or fly to some Extreme on the other Hand, make¦ing some Demand which the Peers of <HI>England</HI> would not submit to.</P>
<P>Others, it was thought, had this further View in the Pro∣posal, for Levelling the <HI>Scots</HI> Nobility that were not sitting Peers with the Commons, That they designed to propose the unsitting Lords to be capable of being Elected into the House of Commons, and sitting in the Lower House.</P>
<P>This was received with some Resentment, as a great Dishonour to the Peerage of <HI>Scotland,</HI> by some people, and especially without Doors; The <HI>English</HI> were Upbraided with endeavouring to have it so—, in order to lessen the Cha∣racter of the Nobility of <HI>Scotland.</HI> But in this they wrong'd their own Judgment, as well as the <HI>English</HI> Nation, since, had such a Thing been offered, it had been rejected in <HI>England,</HI> as Unequal and Injurious to the Equality we have been so often speaking of, as the Ground of the whole Treaty—. Nor could it have been Consented to in <HI>England,</HI> since it had been a bringing the <HI>Scots</HI> Nobility into too great an Influ∣ence of Parliamentary Affairs, when Sixteen being already judged sufficient; there might be now Sixty One <HI>Scots</HI> Lords in every Parliament, <HI>viz.</HI> Sixteen in the House of Lords, and Fourty Five in the Commons; Which, when any Thing re∣lating, especially to the Nobility, or to the Privileges of one House against the other, might turn the Ballance to this or that side, to the manifest Injury of the Constitution, which now consists in the Equality of Powers and Privileges, and the due Limits set between each kind, to prevent their In∣croachment upon one another.</P>
<P>But the Wisdom and Modesty of the Nobility of <HI>Scotland,</HI> prevented this—; and the Article had been so well con∣sidered at <HI>London,</HI> and was so warily Worded, that there was Room for little or no Exception on behalf of the Peers: For 1. As to Privileges, the Sixteen Peers, or the Peers of Parliament for the Time being, had effectually all the Privi∣leges
<PB N="188" REF="475"/>
of the Peers of <HI>England</HI> in the utmost Extent, and all the Privileges they ever after could receive, could not be received but in Common with the said Sixteen; Nor could any Ex∣ception be made to it, Whether in the Cases of Parliamen∣tary Privileges, or the personal Privileges in case of Trying of Peers, or being Tryed as Criminals.</P>
<P N="2">2. The remainder of the Nobility enjoyed Privileges, every way equal to the <HI>English</HI> Nobility, excepting only, <HI>as it is in the Article,</HI> the Rights of sitting in the House of Lords, and the Privileges depending thereupon.</P>
<P>But the great Debates of this Day began upon this Clause, The Rights and Privileges of the <HI>Scots</HI> Nobility who were not Lords of Parliament <HI>for the Time being.</HI></P>
<P>And First it was moved to be excepted, That the said Lords should not enjoy the Privilege of personal Protection in Cases of Debt, as is the Privilege of the Peers of <HI>England</HI>—; Some alledged they pleaded for the Honour of the <HI>Scots</HI> Nobility in this Head, that it was below their Dignity to be protected by their Titles against their just Obligations, and a Meanness they had all along Contemned, to plead the Privilege of their House against the proceedings of the Law; That it was not agreeable to the true Intent and Meaning of Parliamentary Privileges, that this Privilege should extend to those that did not sit in Parliament, since the Privileges of Parliament of this kind, were at first appointed to provide against any Im∣pediment to sitting in Parliament, that the Members of either Houses should on no pretence what ever, be hindred from the Service of their Countrey in Parliament—; And this could not be of any Signification in those Peers that were not sitting Members of the House of Lords; That for the <HI>Scots</HI> Peers to claim Protection for their Persons against their just Debts, was more than levelling their Persons with the Com∣mons, for it was setting them below the Commons, since no Man would then Trust the Nobility in Matters of Debt, with∣out some Commoner being Security for them, against whom they might have remedy at Law.</P>
<P>These Objections had no little Weight, and this Privi∣lege of the Persons of the Peers in Cases of Debt, seemed at first View, very grievous to <HI>Scotland,</HI> and some of the Peers themselves looked upon it as Dishonourable.</P>
<P>But when it was calmly Considered and Answered, That the Persons of the Peers in <HI>England,</HI> are accounted Sacred on several Accounts, besides those of Debt—, that even the Government can not proceed against a Peer, but in an Ex∣traordinary way, that no Warrant can be Executed in the House of a Peer, but by Three Justices of the Peace—; And that there are several necessary Exemptions to the Peerage which this Privilege preserves, besides that of Debt—; And which, as they are the Hereditary Counsellors of the
<PB N="189" REF="476"/>
Nation, and have frequently Great Trusts committed to, them—; And both are, and ought to be a great and ready Assistance to the publik Good, upon sudden Emergencies, which, upon pretence of Arrests and Attachments for Debt, may be prevented. That as to the Justice of Personal Pro∣tection in case of Debt, it was Answered, Their Estates were not protected in several Cases, only their Persons—; And it was as Reasonable to pursue the Estate, as the Person of the Debitor—, and especially in <HI>Scotland,</HI> where the Law reaches the Effects of the Debitor, tho' on personal Bonds—. That as to the Credit and Honour of being protected against just Debts, it would be much more for the Honour of the <HI>Scots</HI> Nobility, that they gave all Men Notice, That they despised the Advantage of their personal Credit, and since they could not Sue a Nobleman, they might Decline Trusting them, and welcome: And for those that were Trusted, tho' they could not be Sued, it was yet greater Reputation to them, that the principle of Honour in them was so well known, that Men would depend upon their Honour, where they could not otherwise oblige them to make payment.</P>
<P>Upon these, and the like Considerations, this Motion was Rejected, and the <HI>Scots</HI> Nobility by virtue of that Clause in the Twenty Third Article, <HI>And shall enjoy all other privileges of Peers, as fully as the Peers of</HI> England <HI>now do, or as they, or any other Peers of</HI> Great-Britain <HI>may hereafter enjoy the same;</HI> are protected in their Persons and Estates as the Peers of <HI>England</HI> are—, whether they (the <HI>Scots</HI> Peers) are Peers of Parliament at that Time, or no.</P>
<P>The next Dispute was, a Privilege demanded for the Peers of <HI>Scotland,</HI> that they, not being of the Parliament at that Time, might sit in the House of Lords Cover'd, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but not have any Right to Vote—; This was Urged many ways, either that they might have a Gallery to sit in as Spectators, or that they might stand behind the Throne, as the eldest Sons of the <HI>English</HI> Peers may—; And either of these, was thought, might have been obtained—. But the main Design of bringing them in to be present at Debates, to Argue, Speak and Debate upon the several Matters that should be brought before the House, this was Opposed upon several Accounts; <HI>First,</HI> As it was thought Impracticable, and an Invasion of the House of Peers as a House, and what could not be obtained, if pusht at. <HI>Secondly,</HI> As it was thought an Insignificant Thing, to have persons to sit and argue, who had no power to De∣termine. And <HI>Thirdly,</HI> As it would be far from any Honour to the Nobility of <HI>Scotland,</HI> to be admitted into Debates, where they must always have the Mortification of being distinguished, and like meer Solicitors, whose place is with∣out the Bar, be allowed to Talk, and yet have no signification in a Question—; But if the House divided, be obliged to
<PB N="190" REF="477"/>
stand all together like Mutes in an Alphabet, who have no sound in the Expression of a Syllable.</P>
<P>And thus ended the Debates of this great point, the Pri∣vilege of the Peerage, and the Article received no manner of Alteration.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATION LVIII.</HEAD>
<P>The Debate of the Rank and Precedency of the Heraulds, and of the Quartering of Arms, the Standards and Colours was a Thing of no great Consequence, nor could it be re∣ferred to any Body better than to Her Majesty; and therefore the Dispute of this was not long.</P>
<P>The keeping the Honours, as they called them, in <HI>Scot∣land, viz.</HI> The Crown, Scepter and Sword, was indeed a Material Point, at least, as it had been made so by some Gentlemen, who had pretended to excite the Common People with Apprehensions, That they were to be all carryed away to <HI>England,</HI> as Tokens of Surrendering the Sovereignty of <HI>Scotland</HI> to the <HI>English</HI>—; But, as no such Thing was ever thought of in <HI>England,</HI> the Proposal met with no Op∣position; And some people thought, That not only the Ensigns of Royalty, but the Royalty it self, Sovereignty and Govern∣ment of <HI>Scotland,</HI> remain as intire, as the same Things respect∣ing <HI>England</HI> remain intire, either Kingdom voluntarly con∣senting to an Union of Power, an Union of Government, and of all Things needful to preserve both.</P>
<P>The last Article, respecting the Abrogation of all Laws, which might be supposed to Contraveen the Treaty, met with no Opposition at all.</P>
<P><HI>And thus this Weighty Affair was Finished on the Side of</HI> Scotland, <HI>contrary, I believe I may say, to the Expectation of all the World, who were amazed to see a Thing of that Consequence, and with Difficulties which seemed in themselves insuperable, so successfully brought to a Close; A Thing which had been so many Times attempted in vain; A Thing which had so often been set about, rather in a Show than Design of Ʋniting; And I think I may say, a Thing that never was heartily set about on both Sides before.</HI></P>
<P><HI>It had held the Parliament of</HI> Scotland <HI>a Long, a Troublesome, a Dangerous, and I must owne a very Ʋncomfortable Debate, Step by Step, and Article by Article, from the Third of</HI> October <HI>to the Fourteenth of</HI> January, <HI>with very little Intermission, for never was Business closer applyed, more strenuously push'd, or more vigorously opposed.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Work that remained (I mean to the Parliament) was but short, and I shall do little more than relate the Fact, which will be found in the Minutes of Parliament—; And I shall set them down in their Order, omitting what relates to private Busi∣ness, as not material here—; Since I can very ill spare Room for any thing, but what relates immediately to the Business, and agrees with the Title—</HI></P>

<P>The Articles were now gone through, and finished as before—, yet there remained two Things to be done in or∣der to Compleating the Affair, so far as referred to <HI>Scotland;</HI> One was to pass the Act of Security for the Presbyterian Church Government in <HI>Scotland,</HI> which was to be Ingrossed and Inserted in the Body of the Act of Union, &amp; made a part of it—; And then, to pass in Parliament some subsequent Acts, which being previous to the Treaty, or depending upon it, ought to be Finished in Parliament before the Union, and would be of Course Confirmed by it, by virtue of the Eigh∣teenth Article, Continuing and Confirming all Laws and Acts then in Force, except such only as came within the Reach of
<PB N="193" REF="480"/>
the Twenty Fifth Article, <HI>viz.</HI> Such as were contrary to, and inconsistent with the Union.</P>
<P>These were, 1. An Act to Settle and Determine the Con∣stitution of the Manner of Electing the Representatives for <HI>Scotland</HI> in the ensuing Parliament of <HI>Great Britain.</HI> 2. An Act for Plantation of Kirks, a Thing long wanted in <HI>Scotland,</HI> together with the Valuation of Teinds or Tithes, and about the Reversions of Kirk Lands. 3. For the Settling the pub∣lick Debts, Disposing and Appointing the Equivalent, <HI>i. e.</HI> The Payment of it according to the true Intent of the Treaty, Adjusting the Affair of the <HI>African</HI> Company, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which was now under Reference to a Committee.</P>
<P>These Things were necessary Adjuncts to the Treaty—; But as the Act of Union it self was the Foundation, on which all these Things were depending, and that there was a great deal yet to be done to it, <HI>viz.</HI> To be Ingrossed and pass'd into an Act, and sent to <HI>London;</HI> The Interval of Time, after the main Affair should be dispatched, was thought the proper Season to Settle, Pass and Enact all these Things; wherefore they resolved to go first to Work with the Act, and that no Time might be lost, the Act had been drawing up, with all the Amendments to every Article, as they had pass'd in the House, and was ready to present to the House this Day—; And, as <HI>per</HI> the Minute, obtained a first Reading, all other Business being delayed—.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATION LX.</HEAD>
<P>The Act for the Union admitted now no Debate, the Articles having been Voted and Approved One by One, as is seem at large; So there was nothing to do, but to put the Question upon, and to mark it a second Reading, ac∣cording to the custom of the Parliament of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>The Church Act was to be inserted in the Body of the Act of Union, as a part of the Treaty, and yet it was to be passed into an Act by it self, and Touched by the Scepter in Form as an Act of Parliament, before the Act of Union was passed, <HI>AND IT WAS ACCORDINGLY DONE SO,</HI> As <HI>per</HI> the Minute; So that the Act for the Establishment of the Church of <HI>Scot∣land,</HI> received a double Sanction in this Parliament; It was not Enacted singly by the Union, as an Effect of the Treaty, but was Established by a Law before the Union, and again Repeated in the Body of the Treaty of Union, as a Ratifica∣tion only or Recognition of what before was an Established Law of the Kingdom.</P>
<P>Of the first Representation and Petition of the Commissi∣on of the General Assembly. I have spoken already at large; There was some little Debate about it now, but it made no Alteration in the Act of the Church, but it past as it had been before settled.</P>
<P>However, that it may be seen what Addition was made to the first Overture, I have added both the Overture as first given in, and the Act as it was passed in Parliament, and what more was required, will be seen in the Representation of the Commission; All which are added in the <HI>Appendix.</HI></P>
<P>It is to be observed here, That there was a second Re∣presentation and Petition presented to the Parliament this Day from the Commission of the General Assembly, upon the following Occasion.</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="483"/>
The Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> having been effectually secured by an Act of Parliament, called, <HI>The Act of Security,</HI> &amp;c. and which was made a part of the Act of Union, as appears in its place; There was a Clause added in the End of the Act of Union, in these Words; <HI>Declaring nevertheless, that the Par∣liament of</HI> England <HI>may provide for the Security of the Church of</HI> England, <HI>as they shall think Expedient, to take place within the Bounds of the said Kingdom of</HI> England, <HI>and not Derogating from the Security above provided for Establishing the Church of</HI> Scotland <HI>within the Bounds of this Kingdom, which shall not Suspend or Derogate from the Force and Effect of this present Ra∣tification, but shall be understood as here included, without any necessity of any new Ratification in the Parliament of</HI> Scotland.</P>
<P>This was called, an Establishing the Church of <HI>England</HI> with the Hierarchy of Episcopacy and Ceremonies of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> by the Presbyterian Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> I have for the more direct Understanding this Part, given the said Representation and Petition in the <HI>Appendix</HI> N<SUP>o.</SUP> K x. with the Reasons at that Time given for it, to which I re∣fer.</P>
<P>I could not suffer the two Protestations of the Families of <HI>Douglass</HI> and <HI>Hamilton,</HI> to be Omitted in the Minutes, tho' with respect to the length of this Work, I have Industriously shun'd private Affairs, but the Honour of Leading the Van of the <HI>Scots</HI> Armies, which these Families Contended for, might give both the Kingdoms a Remembrance of what the Union has delivered them from, since these Armies were only such as within the Bowels of this poor Island Fought with, and shewed their Courage, in Butchering and Destroying one ano∣ther, a Thing, its hoped, is now effectually put to an End.</P>
<P>The Affair of War is now carried Abroad, against the an∣cient professed Enemy of all Protestant Powers, where the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Scots</HI> Valour need no more Contend, but Unite to∣gether, to Overthrow their Foreign Adversaries—, a Contest, which if they had been United in, as they are now, in for∣mer Ages, perhaps <HI>Europe</HI> had paid Honours enough to Us before now, as to the greatest Nation in the World.</P>

<P>This is the Famous Day to <HI>Scotland,</HI> in which She set Her Signal to the Union of <HI>Great-Britain;</HI> We shall now make a short Digres∣sion, to Enquire how it went on in the Parliament of <HI>England,</HI> and what Reception it met with there, which, because it is but very short, I shall bring in here, and adjourning the Minutes a little, shall return to them again in their Course.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Act of Ratification after it was past in the Parliament of <HI>Scotland,</HI> till the Exemplification of it was returned from the Parliament of <HI>England.</HI></HEAD>
<P>The Parliament of <HI>England</HI> being to be the Finishers of this great Work, and the Parliament of <HI>Scotland</HI> not Meeting till it was late enough in the year, <HI>viz.</HI> the second of <HI>October;</HI> The <HI>English</HI> Par∣liament were by small Adjournments, put off, as long as it was possible the publick Affairs of <HI>England</HI> could permit, and longer than any Parliament since the <HI>Revolution</HI> had been delayed, not ha∣ving Met till the Third of <HI>December</HI>—, when the publick Business admitting no more delay, they came together:</P>
<P>It is worth Observation, that this was a strange concurring Juncture, a Critical Moment, as it may be called, in which Provi∣dence seemed to bring every Thing together, that could Propagate the Great Affair of the Uniting the Kingdoms; And which it may not be Improper to Notice in this place, because at the Opening of this Session of the <HI>English</HI> Parliament, the Queen Her self took No∣tice of it.</P>
<P>The Campaign Abroad had Ended in the most Glorious manner for the Confederates, that could be desired, and above all manner of Expectation, the <HI>French</HI> had received three Blows that very Sum∣mer, enough to Overthrow the greatest Empire in the World; One under the Conduct of the Earl of <HI>Peterburgh,</HI> with the <HI>English</HI> Forces and Fleet in the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> Relieving the City of <HI>Barce∣lona,</HI> and causing the <HI>French</HI> with the Loss of all their Cannon and Ammunition, to raise the Siege; One under the Command of the Duke of <HI>Marlborough,</HI> being the great Victory at <HI>Ramellies</HI> in <HI>Flan∣ders;</HI> And the last under the Command of Prince <HI>Eugene</HI> of <HI>Sa∣voy,</HI> at <HI>Turin.</HI> In all which Actions, it was Calculated, that the <HI>French</HI> lost, Slain in Action, Taken Prisoners, Deserted, and Dead of their Wounds, above 100000 Men, with 300 pieces of Cannon and Mortars, and other Spoil without, and indeed past all manner of Account.</P>
<P>There are two Reasons, why I take this Occasion to mention this here—, and both are Introductory to the present Affair.<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The People of <HI>England</HI> by these great Successes, made Glad and Easie in Hopes of a speedy Peace, were prepared to Grant almost any thing which the Queen in Reason could Ask, and the Queen discovering a passionate Desire, to see Her two Jarring, long Contending Kingdoms United, the Parliament came together with a Temper disposed to yield (as far as Reason could suggest) more, than perhaps at any other Juncture could have been expected.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="198" REF="485"/>
2. The Enemies of the Union, whether Abroad or at Home, received most sensible Discouragement in their Designs against it—, and first Abroad.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>There could be but two kinds of Enemies Abroad, to the Union, and these were the <HI>French,</HI> or the <HI>Dutch.</HI></P>
<P>As to the <HI>Dutch,</HI> they were now in so closs a Confederacy with <HI>England,</HI> and their whole Concern as to the War, was so involved together, that there was no Room for any publick Differences about it. Nor indeed could the <HI>Dutch</HI> have put in any rational Objection against it, to either Side, if the Interest of <HI>Holland</HI> Clasht with the Union upon any sort, it was only with respect to Trade; and tho' they might perhaps on that Score, have some Reason to be Jealous of it, as what might <HI>some Time or other</HI> Clash with them in the Fishing and Eastern Trades, yet they could have no pretence to concern themselves publickly and Nationally against it. And as for private Negotiations to Embarrass or prevent it, tho' as <HI>I have been Informed,</HI> they were once or twice considering of it, yet they never thought fit to meddle, whether it was that they saw no prospect of succeeding in it, or that they were not willing to do any thing at that Time, that should give an Uneasiness to <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> or not, I shall not pretend to Determine.</P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>French,</HI> these had no doubt Stomach enough to it, and had Tools enough to work with; And I must own, had they but made the least Attempt, they had effectually broke up the Treaty for that Time; But GOD had tyed their Hands, and Cut them out other Work, they were beset and Embarrast on every Hand, and had no Leasure to look this way; Nor, if they had had Leasure, had they Men or Money then to spare, being Imployed with all their Power and Diligence, to Recruit their Troops, and Restore their own Affairs.</P>
<P>And I cannot but Record this, as a singular Hand of Heaven, in the Affair of the Union; For tho', when the next year the <HI>French</HI> did make an Attempt upon <HI>Scotland,</HI> when their Affairs being bet∣tered after their Success in <HI>Spain,</HI> they thought themselves in a Condition for it—, they found it too late; And that the Op∣posers of the Union were settled, and would not appear for them—, yet I must say, had they made that Attempt at the Time of this Treaty, whatever they might have done in the End, to∣wards Opening the Eyes of the People, and Restoring them to their Senses, they had certainly put all the Nation into the utmost Con∣fusion for the Time, and effectually have broken up the Treaty.</P>
<P>The Parliament of <HI>England</HI> was now Met <HI>December</HI> 3. 1707, &amp; the Queen Opened the Session with the following Speech, which I Insert here, as it refers to the Treaty of Union, and also as it Hints at the Successes I mentioned above.</P>

<SALUTE>My Lords and Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Hope We are all Met together at this Time, with Hearts truly Thankful to Almighty GOD for the Glorious Successes, with which He has Blessed Our Arms and those of Our Allies through the whole Course of this Year, and with Serious and Steady Re∣solutions to Prosecute the Advantages We have Gain'd, till We Reap the Desired Fruit of them, in an Honourable and Durable Peace.</P>
<P>The Goodness of GOD has brought this Happy Prospect so much nearer to Us, that if We be not wanting to Our selves, We may, upon good Grounds, Hope to See such a Ballance of Power Esta∣blisht in <HI>Europe,</HI> that it shall no longer be at the Pleasure of one Prince to Disturb the Repose, and Endanger the Liberties of this Part of the World.</P>
<P>A Just Consideration of the present Posture of Affairs, of the Circumstances of Our Enemies, and the good Disposition of Our Allies, must needs Excite an Uncommon Zeal, and Animate Us to Exert Our Utmost Endeavours at this Critical Conjuncture.</P>
<P><HI>Gentlemen of the House of Commons,</HI></P>
<P>As I am fully Perswaded You are all of this Mind, so I must Ear∣nestly Desire You to Grant Me Supplies sufficient for Carrying on the War next Year in so Effectual a Manner, that We may be able to Improve every where the Advantages of this Successful Campaign: And I Assure You I shall make it my Business to See All You Give Apply'd to those Ends with the greatest Care and Management.</P>
<P><HI>My Lords and Gentlemen,</HI></P>
<P>In Pursuance of the Powers Vested in Me by Act of Parlia∣ment both in <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland,</HI> I have appointed Commissio∣ners to Treat of an Union between the Two Kingdoms, and tho' this be a Work of such a Nature, as could not but be at∣tended with great Difficulties, yet such has been the Application of the Commissioners, that they have Concluded a Treaty, which is at this Time before the Parliament of <HI>Scotland;</HI> And I Hope the Mutual Advantages of an Entire Union of the Two Kingdoms will be found so apparent, that it will not be long before I shall have an Opportunity of Acquainting You with the Success which it has Met with there.</P>
<P>Your Meeting at this Time being Later than Usual, I cannot Conclude, without Earnestly Recommending to You to Give as
<PB N="200" REF="487"/>
much Dispatch to the Publick Affairs, as the Nature of them will Admit, it being of the Greatest Consequence, that both Our Friends and Our Enemies shou'd be Fully Convinced of Your Firmness, and the Vigour of Your Proceedings.</P>
</DIV1>
</BODY>
</TEXT></Q>
<P>I shall not meddle here with any of the Proceedings of the Par∣liament of <HI>England</HI> in their own Affairs, they having no relation to the Case in Hand; Only make this short Remark, That, not∣withstanding the Lateness of their coming together, <HI>the Occasion of which was known to be to attend the Debates of the Parliament of</HI> Scot∣land, they fell so heartily about their Business, and went on so smoothly in every Thing, that they got the Land Tax Bill past ra∣ther sooner in it than it used to be in any former Parliaments—; And before <HI>Christmass,</HI> had not only the Land Tax, but several other of their Publick Funds settled, and in an unusual Forward∣ness—, which is a Confirmation of the Extraordinary Dispositi∣on, which, as I have noted, appeared in <HI>England</HI> at this time, and of which we shall see further Instances presently.</P>
<P>It was the Sixteenth Day of <HI>January,</HI> that the Ratification of the Union pass'd in <HI>Scotland;</HI> On the Eighteenth the Duke of <HI>Queensberry</HI> dispatch'd it away by an Express; There were several Gentlemen who contended for the Honour of Carrying it up to the Queen, but, to avoid giving any Offence, it was sent by an ordinary Courrier or Express.</P>
<P>As soon as it came to the Queen, Her Majesty caused it to be laid before both Houses, that, tho' it was first to pass one House, and then the other, yet the particular Houses might be upon the several Articles together.</P>
<P>Great was the Expectation in both Kingdoms from these De∣bates of the <HI>English</HI> Parliament, and in <HI>Scotland,</HI> the Fears on one Hand, and the Hopes on the other, are not to be express'd—, but the House of Commons deceived both Sides.</P>
<P>On the Twenty Second of <HI>January</HI> it was read in the House of Commons—. and as the best way to go thro' the whole, they ordered every Article to be Read and Voted upon singly in the Committee of the whole House.</P>
<P>It may perhaps surprize Posterity, when the <HI>Debates, Disputes, Heats</HI> and long <HI>Speeches,</HI> which these Articles occasioned in <HI>Scotland,</HI> come to be read—, and they shall come to understand, that, in the House of Commons in <HI>England,</HI> every Article pass'd one by one after the Sedatest Reading, Calmest Considering, and Leasurely Pro∣ceeding, without any Opposition, Amendment or Alteration, no not in the least.</P>
<P>There was some small Opposition against it in general in the House of Lords—, but no Amendment offered to any particular Article, nor any thing considerable objected; what was objected seems generally contained in some Protests, and Reasons given in by the Persons Protesting against it, which were but few, and not much noticed.</P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="488"/>
At the same time that the Articles were Reading in the House of Commons, an Act was also prepared by the Bishops, to whom that Affair was referred for Security of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> to be passed in the Parliament, and then Ratified, by being Inserted in the Body of the Act of Union, as the Act for the Security of of the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> had been done before.</P>
<P>This had been so far provided for by a Blank left in the Treaty of Ratification to which, so far as it concerned the Security of the Church of <HI>England</HI> only, the Parliament of <HI>Scotland</HI> declared themselves to assent, as if it was expressed; And this was thought but just, the Parliament of <HI>Scotland</HI> having had the Drawing up, and Wording of their own Act of Security themselves, tho' some People made loud Objections against this, as a plain Establishing Episcopacy in <HI>England</HI> by the very Parliament of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>It was indeed leaving the Thing as Self-existent, as it was pos∣sible, it was absolutely necessary, That the Treaty of Union should be Ratified by either Kingdom—; But, as to the Acts severally Establishing the respective Churches, they were the distinct Act and Deed of either Kingdom: And, if the <HI>Scots</HI> may be said to have Consented to Establish Episcopacy, it is every whit as plain, That the <HI>English</HI> have Establish'd Presbytery in <HI>Scotland,</HI> with this fur∣ther Distinction, That what has been done in <HI>Scotland,</HI> is an Act of the State only, in <HI>England</HI> both Church and State have given their Sanction to the Establishment of the Presbyterian Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> the Bishops being the Representatives of the Church of <HI>England</HI> in this Case—; At the same Time, I think the Matter clear, That, with respect to Union, their Establishment is Recipro∣cally secure, and either Kingdoms cannot now put their Hand to the Weakening or Injuring the Establishment of the other, without setting, at the same time, its Hand to the Destruction of its own Constitution.</P>
<P>This Act for the Security of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> seems to be the exact Copy of the Act for Security of the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> with the necessary Alterations only of Names, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> A Testimony indeed unexpected to the Sufficiency of the Act of Security for <HI>Scot∣land,</HI> in that the Church of <HI>England</HI> Divines being left to their full Liberty to make their Constitution as safe as it was possible to be, contented themselves with the very same Model which the <HI>Scots</HI> had pass'd for themselves, as the best and compleatest Security they could devise—, which they that cavilled so much at the Securi∣ty of the Act in <HI>Scotland</HI> as insufficient, might have received great Satisfaction from, if they had thought fit—.</P>
<P>The Copy of this Act in <HI>England</HI> is added in the <HI>Appendix, N<SUP>o</SUP>. H. xx.</HI></P>
<P>I need not Count Days, nor Enter into the Minutes of this Affair in the <HI>English</HI> Parliament; It may suffice to tell the Reader, That the whole Act pass'd both Houses by the Fourth of <HI>March,</HI> and the Queen pass'd it on the Sixth: It was designed to have delayed the passing it to the Eighth, which was the Day of Her Majesties
<PB N="202" REF="489"/>
coming to the Crown; That so the Day might have been doubly Remembered, for the Commencement of Her Majesties Reign over the Three Kingdoms first, and then over the United Kingdom of <HI>Britain;</HI> But Her Majesty, not willing to delay a Thing which the whole Island waited so much for, and had their Eyes upon, went to the House of Lords on the Sixth of <HI>March,</HI> and having pass'd the Bill, made the following Speech, with which I think I may close this short Period of the Union, I mean its passing in <HI>Eng∣land.</HI><Q>There was some Opposition made to the Articles in the House of Lords in <HI>England,</HI> and some Lords Protested against the several Articles, and some against all of them—; But the House of Lords in <HI>England</HI> having expresly forbid the Printing any of the Proceedings of their House, I cannot enter upon the Historical Part of it; I hope something like an Abridgment of some Matters, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> may be found in the <HI>Ap∣pendix,</HI> N<SUP>o</SUP>.

<HEAD>The QUEEN's Speech to the <HI>English</HI> Par∣liament, at the Passing the UNION.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lords and Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>It is with the greatest Satisfaction, that I have given my Assent to a Bill, for the Uniting <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland</HI> into one Kingdom.</P>
<P>I consider this UNION as a Matter of the greatest Importance to the Wealth, Strength and Safety of the whole Island; And at the same time, as a Work of so much Difficulty and Nicety, in its own Nature, That, till now, all Attempts which have been made toward it, in the Course of above an Hundred Years, have proved ineffectual: And therefore I make no doubt, but it will be remem∣bred and spoke of hereafter, to the Honour of those who have been Instrumental in bringing it to such an Happy Conclusion.</P>
<P>I desire and expect from all my Subjects of both Nations, That, from henceforth, they Act with all possible Respect and Kindness to one another, That so it may appear to all the World, they have Hearts disposed to become one People.</P>
<P>This will be a great Pleasure to Me, and will make Us all quickly sensible of the good Effects of this UNION.</P>
<P>And I cannot but look upon it as a particular Happiness, That, in My Reign, so full a Provision is made for the Peace and Quiet of My People, and for the Security of Our Religion, by so firm an Esta∣blishment of the Protestant Succession throughout <HI>Great Britain.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Gentlemen of the House of Commons.</HI></P>
<P>I have this Occasion to Remind You of making effectual Provision for the Payment of the <HI>Equivalent</HI> to <HI>Scotland,</HI> within the time ap∣pointed
<PB N="203" REF="490"/>
by this Act; And I am perswaded You'll show as much Readiness in this Particular, as You have done in all the other Parts of this great Work.</P>
<P><HI>My Lords and Gentlemen,</HI></P>
<P>The Season of the Year being now pretty far advanced, I hope You will continue the same Zeal which has appeared throughout this Session, in dispatching what yet remains unfinished of the Publick Business before You.</P>

<P>It took up some time in <HI>England,</HI> to Ingross and Inroll, and make Copies of this great Transaction, the Original of which was to be Lodged in the Tower of <HI>London,</HI> and an Exemplification under the Great Seal of <HI>England,</HI> to be sent down to <HI>Scotland,</HI> to be again Read in Parliament there, and then laid up in the Registers and Rolls of Parliament <HI>in perpetuam rei memoriam.</HI></P>
<P>I must now return to the Minutes of the Parliament, where se∣veral Things subsequent to the Treaty, but really absolutely ne∣cessary to its Existence, was to be Finished, and which took them up the Time between the sending up the Ratification, and receiving down the Exemplification, as above.</P>

<P>Upon Reading of the Minutes, it was Moved to insert therein the Petitory part of the Representation and Petition of the Com∣mission of the General Assembly of the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> menti∣oned in the said Minutes.

<P>And after further Debate, the Duke of <HI>Hamilton</HI> made a Motion for a State of a Vote, wherein the Petitory part of the said Petition was repeated; But that State of the Vote being reclaimed against, as yielding the Question, the Duke of <HI>Hamilton</HI> protested, <HI>That he having made Motion, and being seconded, it was against the Rule of Parliament to refuse a Vote; and to insert his Motion in the Minutes.</HI></P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATION LXI.</HEAD>
<P>It was not very easie to know the Reason, why they de∣sired the Petitory part, as they called it, of this Paper to be inserted in the Minutes—; Some were of the Opinion, it was to show the Nation, That the Opposers of the Union were Friends to the Church, and that they would have it ap∣pear, they stood up for the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI>—; Others thought it was with design to Expose the Presbyterians to the Church of <HI>England,</HI> as utter Enemies to their Constitution—; Nor could I ever hear any other Reasons given for it—. However, the Duke after having with some Di∣ficulty obtained a Vote upon it, <HI>LOST IT;</HI> And so the Re∣presentation and Petition was left just where they found it, <HI>viz.</HI> As a Testimony of the Church against some Things which were thought to Clash, both with their Constitution and a little with their Principles, and in this it was thought it had its Uses, tho' it was not effectually Answered in Parlia∣ment.</P>
<P>The Affair of the Electing their Members for the first Par∣liament of <HI>Britain,</HI> came next upon the Stage, and the Ground of the Motion mentioned in the Minutes, was foun∣ded upon a Supposition mentioned in the Twelfth Article of the Treaty, <HI>viz.</HI> That <HI>Her Majesty on or before the first day of</HI> May, <HI>on which day the Ʋnion was to take place, should declare under the Great Seal of</HI> England, <HI>that it is Expedient that the Lords of Parliament of</HI> England, <HI>and Commons of the present Parliament of</HI> England, <HI>should be the Members of the respective Houses of the first Parliament of</HI> Great-Britain, <HI>for and on the part of</HI> Great-Britain. Now it was thought very equal, that if the <HI>then present sitting</HI> Parliament of <HI>England,</HI> should be Nam∣med
<PB N="205" REF="492"/>
for the first Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> in Conjunction with the several Members that should be Named from <HI>Scot∣land,</HI> that the Members of both Houses which were to Re∣present <HI>Scotland,</HI> should be likewise Named out of the current or then present sitting Parliament of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>It was pretty easie to conjecture, that Her Majesty would appoint these Members of the <HI>English</HI> Parliament, to Consti∣tute the first <HI>British</HI> Parliament, as it after happened, and therefore this was Moved now—, in order to settle it in the Act of Parliament now to be made, in which it was ab∣solutely necessary to be Determined, this Matter being to be Signed, and past into a Law, before the Union was to take place—. What vigorous Opposition it met with, will be seen in the next Observation.</P>

<P>And Mr. <HI>William Cochran</HI> of <HI>Kilmaronock</HI> gave in a Protestation in these Terms, <Q REND="inline">"I Mr. <HI>William Cochran</HI> of <HI>Kilmaronock</HI> do protest in my own Name, and in Name of all those that shall Adhere to this my Protestation, that the Electing of Members to Represent this part of the United Kingdom in the Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> out of this present Parliament, by the Members of this House, is contrary to, and inconsistent with the Birth-rights and Privileges of the Barons and Burrows of <HI>Scotland;</HI> That it is con∣trary to the Principles of common Law, and divers Acts of Parli∣ament, and directly opposite and contradictory to the express Words and Meaning of two several Paragraphs of the Twenty Two Article of the Treaty of Union betwixt <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>England,</HI> so lately Ratified in this House; And I desire this my Protestation may be insert in the Minutes, and Recorded in the Books of Parlia∣ment, upon which I take Instruments.</Q></P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATION LXII.</HEAD>
<P>The Reason of the Earl of <HI>Stair</HI>'s taking the Oaths now, and his place in Parliament, was very Unhappy at this Time; his Father the Earl of <HI>Stair,</HI> justly reputed the greatest Man of Counsel in the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland,</HI> died sudden∣ly the Eighth of this Moneth—; he had been an Eminent Instrument in carrying on the Union, and had, the very day of his Death, spoken very Earnestly in the House, upon some particular Cases relating to the Union, he went out of the House not very Well, yet went Home, and Wrote several Letters that very Night to <HI>England,</HI> and in the Morning Died in his Bed, without being able to speak so much as to his Lady, who was with him, to the general Grief of the whole Island, being Universally Lamented.</P>
<P>The Debate was now renewed about Choosing the Repre∣sentatives for the first Parliament, the principal Objection was against Choosing them out of the current Parliament—; As to the Allegations of its being against Law and Constituti∣on, and against the Twenty Second Article of the Treaty just then ratified, they all Center'd in this, that it was to be passed and approved by Parliament; And that Parliament having yet the whole Legislature in their Hands, had power to Repeal any Law, or Statute then in Beeing, and conse∣quently did so far repeal any Clause in any Act of Parliament formerly made—; As to its being against the Treaty now ratified, that was Rectified thus, That whereas the Act of Ratification of the Treaty of Union in the Parliament of <HI>Scotland,</HI> in which several Acts since made and to be made in the Parliament of <HI>Scotland,</HI> were yet to be inserted, lay now before the Parliament of <HI>England</HI>—; What ever Me∣thod the Parliament of <HI>Scotland</HI> thought fit to take, for the Nomination of the Members of Parliament, for the first Par∣liament of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> should, and must of Course also be inserted, and so be and become an Essential Part or Branch of the Union; And this Vote having passed as <HI>per</HI> the Minute, is inserted in the said Act for settling the Election
<PB N="208" REF="495"/>
of the Members, and again Recited in the Act of Union, as <HI>per</HI> the Exemplification, appears, in these Words; <HI>in that Case only, Doth hereby</HI> Statute <HI>and</HI> Ordain, <HI>That the Sixteen Peers and Fourty Five Commissioners for Shires and Burghs, who shall be Chosen by the Peers, Barons and Burghs res∣pectively in this present Session of Parliament, and out of the Members thereof, in the same manner as Committees of Parlia∣ment are usually now Chosen, shall be the Members of the res∣pective Houses of the said First Parliament of</HI> Great Britain, <HI>for and on the part of</HI> Scotland; <HI>Which Nomination and Election being Certifyed by a Write under the Lord Clerk Registers Hand, The Persons so Nominated and Elected shall have Right to Sit and Vote in the House of Lords, and in the House of Commons of the said First Parliament of</HI> Great Britain; <HI>As by the said Act passed in</HI> Scotland, for settling the Manner of Electing the Sixteen Peers and Fourty Five Members to Represent <HI>Scot∣land</HI> in the Parliament of <HI>Great Britain</HI> may appear; <HI>Be it therefore further</HI> Enacted <HI>and</HI> Declared <HI>by the Authority afore∣said, That the said last mentioned Act passed in</HI> Scotland, for settling the Manner of Electing the Sixteen Peers and Fourty Five Members to Represent <HI>Scotland</HI> in the Parliament of <HI>GREAT BRITAIN,</HI> as aforesaid, <HI>shall be, and the same is hereby Declared to be as valid, as if the same had been part of, and Ingrossed in the said Articles of Ʋnion, Ratified and Ap∣proved by the said Act of Parliament of</HI> Scotland, <HI>and by this Act as aforesaid,</HI> and carried it for the New Model; The Two Protestations against it made a great Noise, and were print∣ed and carryed all over the Kingdom, besides their being printed in the Minutes of Parliament. Some said, the chief Reason why they insisted on this so much was, That the Party who opposed the Union foresaw, that, as they had been outvoted and overpowered, as they called it, in every Question relating to the Union, so they would be in this, and that, by Consequence, few or none of them would be Named to the First <HI>British</HI> Parliament, which was really true in the Consequence.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS LXIII, LXIV, LXV.</HEAD>
<P>I put these three Minutes together, because they are all on the same Subject, <HI>viz.</HI> The Electing the Representatives to the
<PB N="211" REF="498"/>
Parliament of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> which was now to be formed into an Act by it self.</P>
<P>There had been several Schemes of Elections laid down for the Peers, and three Overtures had been presented to the House—; Some were for Naming the several Fami∣lies, and Fixing the Representative to be Chosen out of them Exclusively—, and these were those who pretended to make Distinctions between the Ancient and Modern No∣bility—; They thought it was reasonable, since the Num∣bers of Noblemen lately made, and especially in the last Thirty or Fourty Years, were but burdensome, as they al∣ledged, to the Nation, that those Families newly made Noble should relinquish this Affair to the Ancient Nobility, as what was Inherent in them, but a new Accession to these; and that, since <HI>Scotland</HI> was to Retrench her Nobility, as to sitting in Parliament, it was but just they should be preferred, who had the most Ancient Title.</P>
<P>Others were for dividing the Nobility into Four Classes, and taking every Year a proportioned Number out of each Class.</P>
<P>Others were for taking by Rotation, and so, beginning at the Extremes, take the Families as they Rise, either be∣ginning at the eldest or youngest Peers.</P>
<P>But all these Methods were rejected, and that of Election carryed it, whether it were, that each Party thought them∣selves able to carry it from the other, or that they thought it their Advantage, that they should carry it, who could make the best Interest I know not—; But I cannot say they took the best way for the preserving the publick Tran∣quillity, since the Factions and Party-makings for the Interest of Elections, which must necessarily be the Consequence of this Method, cannot but keep up a constant Feud of Parties and Families in the Nation, which must necessarily be renew∣ed every Three Year, the Parliament being to be new Chosen so often—; During which time, the Parties will be at Work, to Cultivate, Encrease, and Fortify their se∣veral Interests, which, <HI>it is to be doubted,</HI> will go a great way to Entailing a Spirit of Division and Party-strife upon the whole Nation—; I wish I may be found to have made a wrong Conjecture,—, but I shall have Occasion to speak to this again in the Process of this Story, and to ob∣serve, how too much of this was made good in the very first Election, <HI>I mean,</HI> for the second <HI>British</HI> Parliament. Of which hereafter—.</P>
<P>After the settling of the Affair of the Peers, it was to be Determined how the Fourty Five Members for the House of Commons should be proportioned, and this was prepared for them before hand, and given in in a Scheme or Overture, which occasioned some Dispute—; The number of the
<PB N="212" REF="499"/>
Shires and Counties and Stewartries that formerly Elected, were {left blank} these were now to be reduced by joyn∣ing Two or Three together, where they were small and re∣mote, to Thirty Members, each County choosing none but One—, and each Head of Counties, where any were joyn∣ed together, choosing but One—, the Burghs or Royal Burrows were {left blank} in Number, these were Formed into Classes or Districts—, and were for each District to choose one Member; And because the meeting together of the Votes in the said Burghs, might be both Chargeable and Inconvenient, a <HI>Medium</HI> was found out, each Burgh was to choose a Commissioner, in the same manner as usual, which Commissioner was to meet with the Commissioners of the other Burghs of that District, and these were to choose the Mem∣ber.</P>
<P>The respective Persons concerned, made some Opposition about the Joyning of Shires—, but this had been a Thing well Concerted, and therefore admitted the less Dispute in the House; the Persons also who had made the Calculations, being prepared to Defend the Equalities of it—; It re∣mained therefore to agree on the Partition of the Counties and Towns, or as called in the Minutes, Barons and Burghs, which was done with little Dispute, as <HI>per</HI> the Minute.</P>
<P>The Motion against the Eldest Sons of Peers, had not a little to be said for it, particularly that when the Influence of the Nobility in <HI>Scotland</HI> comes to be considered, with the small Number of Members to be chosen, it might in time to come rise to what was Hinted before, in the Project of reducing the Lords that did not sit in the House of Peers, to a Level with the Commons, and make them capable of sitting in the House of Commons, that then it might come to pass, that <HI>Scotland</HI> should be Represented only by her Nobility, and that there should be <HI>Scots</HI> Lords in the Parliament of <HI>Britain;</HI> So here in time it might happen, that the Nobility in the House of Peers, and their Eldest Sons in the House of Commons, might make up the whole Representative of <HI>Scotland</HI>—.</P>
<P>There were a great many Arguments brought against this Proposal, but these seemed the most prevailing, <HI>viz.</HI><LIST>
<ITEM>1. That it had been always allowed in <HI>Scotland</HI> before, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Eldest Sons of Peers might be Elected.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That in <HI>England</HI> the Eldest Sons of Peers do sit in the House of Commons, and it would break in upon the Rule of Equalities, to alter it, and put the <HI>Scots</HI> Gentlemen in a worse Condition than the <HI>English.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>After some time a Vote was offered that put it to an End, <HI>viz.</HI> To let the Right of being Elected remain just as it was, without any Alteration at all, that he that had a Right or
<PB N="213" REF="500"/>
Capacity to Vote, or to be chosen before, should have so still; And this ended the Debate.</P>
<P>The manner of Electing the Commons came next to be considered.</P>

<P>Then the Parliament proceeded to consider the Motion for al∣lowing the Commissioners for the Treaty of Union their Expenses; And thereupon a <HI>Resolve</HI> was given in in these Terms, That the Charge of the Commissioners sent to the Treaty of Union on the part of the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland,</HI> who met at <HI>London</HI> in pursuance of Her Majesties Nomination by Authority of Parliament, and of the Allowance to the Secretary of the said Commission, and to the Accomptants appointed by the said Commission, <HI>are publick Debts,</HI> and that there be allowed to each Nobleman, who attended the said Treaty at <HI>London,</HI> the Sum of Twelve Thousand Pounds <HI>Scots,</HI> and to each other of the Commissioners attending, the Sum of Six Thousand Pounds <HI>Scots,</HI> and to the Secretary of the said Commission, the Sum of Four Thousand Eight Hundred Pounds <HI>Scots,</HI> and to each of the Three Accomptants named by the said Commission, the Sum of Two Thousand Four Hundred Pounds <HI>Scots,</HI> and that the said respective Sums be payed out of the Sum of Three Hundred Ninety Eight Thousand Eighty Five Pounds Ten Shillings <HI>Sterling,</HI> mentioned in the Fifteenth Article of the said Treaty of Union, Ratified in this Parliament, and that the said Sums be ranked and preferred after the Sums payable to the Proprietors of the <HI>African</HI> and <HI>Indian</HI> Company of <HI>Scotland pari passu</HI> with the first of the publick Debts appointed to be pay∣ed out of the foresaid Sum of Three Hundred Ninety Eight Thou∣sand and Eighty Five Pounds Ten Shillings <HI>Sterling</HI> Money.</P>

Which being read, upon Reasoning thereon, a Motion being made for restricting the <HI>Quota</HI>'s of the Treaters Expenses, and some Objections being also made against allowing the said Expenses out of the above Fund, the Vote was stated, <HI>Approve of the Resolve,</HI> or <HI>Alter.</HI></P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATION LXVIII.</HEAD>
<P>This Proposal was ill received indeed, and a horrid Cla∣mour raised at it without Doors; The People who had been hot against the Union took hold of it with an Unbridled Railery, Reproaching the Treaters in a most Indecent Man∣ner, Exclaiming at the very Thing it self; Now the Nation might see they said what they had been doing at <HI>London,</HI> and what they had been pursuing ever since that they had sold their Country for a Sum of Money, &amp; they were beginning to share it among them, this referred to the Equivalent out of which this Money was to be paid—; That they Voted for one another, the new Commissioners and the old; and that this was taking that Money away to their private Uses, which they had pretended was to be Imployed in Incouraging the
<PB N="217" REF="504"/>
Manufactures and Imploying the Poor, Raising Stocks for the Woollen Trade and Funds for the Fishing; That these were the specious Pretences, when the Nation was brought in to accept of the Equivalent, but that now it was done and over, now they were dividing the Spoil—; It would be endless to set down the ill Nature of the Day, as soon as this Proposal was talked of without Doors, and yet there was really no Reason, the Gentlemen who went to <HI>England</HI> upon that Occasion, who set all their private Affairs aside to serve their Country, and attended in <HI>England</HI> several Months at Expence enough, should do all this at their own Charges, when, at the same time, every other Article had its Supply out of the General Fund; And therefore, notwithstanding the Clamours of the People, and several Attempts within Doors, first to reject it wholly, then to refuse the payment of it out of the Equivalent, which was indeed refusing it wholly, since there was no other Fund to pay it—; And lastly, to Restrict the Quantity, yet at last it past, as it had been at first proposed.</P>
<P>The Allowance to the Old Treaters, they alledged, was a Trick to draw in the Allowance for the New, because, be∣ing to be Voted together, it was certain, <HI>the Old</HI> would Vote for the <HI>New,</HI> that they might be sure, <HI>the New</HI> would, in Return, Vote for <HI>the Old</HI>—; But there was certainly the same Reason, that one should be allowed their Expence as the other, since, tho' they could not then bring it to a Conclusion, yet their Pains and Expences might not be the less, but rather the more for that, and thus they were both Vot∣ed to be allowed their Charges, as <HI>per</HI> the Minute.</P>

<P>Agreed, That the Meeting of the Peers for the said Elections shall be at any Place Her Majesty shall appoint within the Limits of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>Agreed also, That, in case of the Decease, or Legal Incapacity of any of the Fourty Five Commoners, to be chosen out of this Session of Parliament to the Parliament of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> the Shire, Stewartry, or District of Burrows, for which he is a Member, shall choose another in his place.</P>
<P>Agreed likewise, That, in case of the Decease, or Legal Incapa∣city of any of the Sixteen Peers, the Peers shall meet and Elect another in place of the Deceaser.</P>

<P>The Charges being allowed to the Treaters, it was thought the House would go on and allow this also, but it was pre∣sently rejected—; Some said it was offered by way of Jest, as a Reproach to the Gentlemen that took Money for the Service of their Country.</P>
<P>But the Proposal was made another way, <HI>viz. That no Representative, from either Shire or Burgh, from this Kingdom to the Parliament of</HI> Great Britain, <HI>shall have any Allowance for their Charges or Expences, &amp;c.</HI> It was alledged, That the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> took no such Allowance; and that it would be a Reproach
<PB N="219" REF="506"/>
to <HI>Scotland,</HI> if the <HI>Scots</HI> Gentry should take their Charges from the Country, and the <HI>English</HI> did not.</P>
<P>To this it was Answered, That, tho' the <HI>English</HI> Gentle∣men generally refused the Allowance of the Countries for their Attendance, yet that, by Law, there was such an Al∣lowance due to them from the Countries, and they might not only justify accepting it, but might legally demand it; And therefore it ought, in like manner, be left at Liberty in <HI>Scotland,</HI> when doubtless the <HI>Scots</HI> Representatives, in Pro∣portion to their Capacities, would be found as Frank and Ge∣nerous in sparing the Country as the <HI>English.</HI></P>
<P>And it was remarkable, That in subsequent Elections in <HI>Scotland</HI> for the Counties, it was very often agreed joyntly by the several Candidates for Election, That whosoever carried it, should relinquish any pretence to an Allowance from the County, for their Service in Parliament.</P>
<P>The Affair of Proxies in Election of Peers, is exprest at large in the Minute, and needs no Remark; nor was there any long Debate upon it in the House.</P>
<P>The other Heads also being Matter of Form, only were readily agreed to.</P>
<P>There was indeed some Struggle about Excluding these Noblemen of <HI>Scotland,</HI> who were Noblemen in <HI>England,</HI> or should be Peers of <HI>Britain,</HI> from Voting, but they could not carry it—; And yet 'tis to be observed, that at the first Election of the Sixteen Peers by virtue of this Act, some of the Peers of <HI>Scotland</HI> protested against the Votes of those that had <HI>English</HI> or <HI>British</HI> Titles, a Debate that is not yet (<HI>viz.</HI> at the Writing these Sheets) Determined, tho' this Vote seems to conclude it directly.</P>

<P>The Overtures for Plantation of Kirks and Valuation of Teinds, were put both together, and proceeded upon as one Act, The case was in short thus—; It had been the Custom in former Parliaments, to Grant a Commission to

certain of their own Members to sit as a Court, and to Judge and Determine of several Things relating to the two Heads above, viz. <HI>Plantation of Kirks and Valuation of Teinds;</HI> The Things they Determined of, were Generally,<LIST>
<ITEM>Sale and Valuation of Teinds or Tithes in the several Paroches.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Augmentation of the Stipends of Ministers.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Prorogation of Tacks, <HI>or Leases</HI> of Teinds.</ITEM>

<P>This was a great Loss to the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> upon several Accounts, and had it remained Unsettled at this Juncture, the Injury had been past Remedy; Wherefore it was earnestly Desir'd, and readily Granted, That all the Powers formerly Exercised by the said Commission of Parliament, should now be Conveyed to some particular Court Judica∣tory or Body of Men, that should Judge and Determine in such Cases; some were for having it Vested in the Church it self, and committed to the General Assembly—; But it was alledged, That were to make the Church Judge in Her own Cause, and put too much Power into the Hands of the Assembly; Others were for Desiring it to be in the Hands of the Crown, to Grant Commission to proper Persons, as the Parliament did before—; But that was Objected against, as dangerous to the Safety and Constitution of the Church; at length it was Devolved on the Lords of the Session, and there it past, as in the Act Printed also at large in the <HI>Ap∣pendix N<SUP>o.</SUP></HI> K x x.</P>
<P>The Committee also now made their Report about the Coin, and the manner of settling it the Time of Reducing and Calling in the Money, of which I have spoken already—; but the Report of the Committee being recited in the Proclamation, and that Proclamation stating the particulars exactly, I have placed the said Proclamation in the <HI>Appendix N<SUP>o.</SUP></HI> L x x.

<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS LXXV, LXXVI, LXXVII.</HEAD>
<P>The Church Act about Kirks and Teinds was now settled, the Motion of having these things still referred to a Parlia∣mentary Commission was thought to proceed from these, who were willing it should remain in the same Condition it had lyen in for a long time, <HI>viz. Ʋnsettled and Ʋnprovided for,</HI> since it must yearly put the Persons concerned to make Appli∣cation to the Parliament of <HI>Britain,</HI> which was Remote, and very Troublesome to get such Commission settled, or Triennial∣ly at least—; And whereas, while it lay before their own Parliament, it had, for some Years, been Unsettled; and the Church left, as it were, Unregarded in those Affairs, it might much more be supposed to be neglected, if referred to the <HI>British</HI> Parliament—; That, at the end of every Par∣liament, which, at furthest, would be but Three Years, this
<PB N="227" REF="514"/>
Matter behoved to be laid before them again, and diligent∣ly solicited, in order to have it effectually settled—; This therefore was vigorously opposed, and it was carryed to be referred to the Lords of the Session, as <HI>per</HI> the Act. <HI>Vide</HI> the <HI>Appendix, N<SUP>o</SUP>.</HI> K <HI>xx.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Proemiums</HI> and Drawbacks on the Exportation of Corn had been settled, as before is observed, and are insert∣ed in the Union, as <HI>per</HI> the Act appears; But, in regard the Union was not to take place till <HI>May,</HI> and the want of those Allowances might put a Stop to the Exportation in the mean time, and particularly, That there was a great <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet and several <HI>Norway</HI> Ships in the Port of <HI>Leith</HI> at that time, which would, in case of the Encouragements now to be given, car∣ry away a great Quantity of Corn, before the First of <HI>May,</HI> which Exportation of Corn would be a great Advantage to the Counny, therefore this short lived Act was proposed for the Encouragement of Trade: But it was alledged, That the Term of the Commencement of the Union was so near, that no Convoy would stir, or Ships sail, before that time would be come, and the Advantages would be the same to the Merchant; Upon which, the Bill was dropp'd in the House, and came to nothing.</P>
<P>The Debate about the Chirurgeons and Apothecaries, never came to any Head, the Design was to Authorize the Apothecaries and Chirurgeones, to Administer Physick with∣out the Assistance or Prescription of the Physicians, in Ex∣traordinary cases—; It would have been perhaps a a contested Thing, if the House had been of longer Con∣tinuance, but the End of the Parliament being so near, there was no Time for it.</P>
<P>The Act about Kirk-lands, and Discharging the Feu-duties, was a necessary Law at that Time, in some special Causes, and met with no Opposition.</P>
<P>The House sat on <HI>Thursday</HI> the Twentieth of <HI>February,</HI> but was wholly Imployed about private Business, which I have all along Omitted, as not to the purpose; on the Twenty First they did little, but read the Bill about Prohibiting Musters, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and past it with the Church Act.</P>

<P>And the Committee find, That the Dead Stock belonging to the said <HI>Company,</HI> and consisting of the Ship the <HI>Caledonia</HI> lying in the River of <HI>Clyde,</HI> with her Furniture, Guns, and Apparelling, That Lodging at the Back of <HI>Milns</HI> Square over against the <HI>Tron-Kirk,</HI> with some little Houshold Plenishing therein, and the <HI>Companies</HI> Share of the Cargo of the <HI>Speedwel</HI> Shipwracked in the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> effeiring to the Stock of Six Hundred Pounds <HI>Sterling,</HI> with the Bur∣den of Cellar Rent of the Stores of the <HI>Caledonia,</HI> and the Expences of keeping the said Ship after the first of <HI>May,</HI> and of the Fraught, Seamen and Factors Wages of the said Cargo of the <HI>Speedwell,</HI> and other supervenient Charges upon the said Ship and Cargo, doth, in the whole, extend to One Thousand Six Hundred and Fifty Four Pounds Eleven Shillings and Two Thirds of a Penny <HI>Sterling;</HI> As to which, the Committee having considered, That the Commissio∣ners of the Council General and Directors, who are to Receive the Money, and grant Discharges therefore, are not only to be bound in absolute Warrandice by the said Discharges, but be obliged to give personal Attendance both at receiving in and giving out the said Money, and to keep an Office for that Effect, and to pay Ca∣shiers, Tellers and Book-keepers, and to provide Books, Chests and other Conveniencies for receiving and keeping the Money, until it be payed out, and will be likeways obliged and burdened to im∣ploy Advocates, Writers and other Persons, for Advising the Dis∣charges
<PB N="232" REF="519"/>
to be granted at receiving, and paying out of the Money, and defending Processes on Competition of Rights, or making up of sufficient Titles in the Person of these who are to receive out the Money, and the necessar Attendance and Loss of Time of the saids Commissioners of the Council General and Directors, both for by∣gones and in time coming, and the Losses upon Telling at receiv∣ing in and giving out of the Money; The said Committee are of Opinion, That the foresaid Dead Stock, extending in hail, with and under the said Burden, to the said Sum of One Thousand Six Hundred and Fifty Four Pounds Eleven Shillings and Two Thirds of a Penny <HI>Sterling,</HI> ought to be allowed to the said Company, and retain'd by them for the Ends and Uses foresaid, and particularly, to enable the Council General and Directors of the said Company to pay such necessary Allowances &amp; Satisfaction to the several Gentlemen who suffered in their Persons and Goods for the Companies Services, as their Services, Losses and Sufferings do justly merit.</P>
<P>And the Committee having considered the Act of Parliament esta∣blishing the Company, Privileges therein-contained, and that part of the Representation relating thereto, They are of Opinion, That, when the Company is Dissolved, and the Capital Stock and Interest paid in by the Commissioners, and others intrusted with the Equivalent, to the Hands of the Commissioners appointed by the Council General and Directors to receive the same, every Proprietors Share may be recovered out of the Hands of the said Commissioners, to be appointed by the said Council General and Directors, as other Money belonging to private Persons.</P>

<P>On the Third of <HI>March</HI> the Report of the Committee was only again read, and little done, the Day being taken up on private Business.</P>
<P>On the Fifth they spent a little Time in considering fur∣ther the Report of the Committee—, and read an Over∣ture concerning the Debts of the Company, which, as it was the Foundation of the Act that afterwards passed, and by which all this Matter was settled, I think it very needful to publish it, and have therefore placed it in the <HI>Appendix, N<SUP>o</SUP>. A x x.</HI></P>
<P>Upon this Overture, as is above noted, together with the Report of the Committee, the Act for settling the pay∣ment of these Things out of the Equivalent to the <HI>African</HI> Company was built, and the Regulation being exactly set down in the Print, any further Observation seems need∣less.</P>

<P>The Committee had now settled the Sum, which in the Gross was to be paid to the Proprietors of the <HI>African</HI> Com∣pany; the Question that remained, was, by what Method it should be Distributed, and to whom it should be paid—; Two Motions were made about it.<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That it should be paid out by the Commissioners who were to be appointed for the general Distribution of the Equivalent, and by them immediately paid to the Persons, who had a Right to the payment by Act of Par∣liament.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Some thought this was Dishonourable to the Di∣rectors of the Company, and they moved, that they should appoint Persons to Receive and Distribute the Money, but this last met with very little Approbation.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>I care not to take notice of some Disputes that happened upon this Occasion, because they seemed to make Personal Reflections—; and only signified, that some People were more Jealous of one another, than I hope there was occasion for on either Side—; But it was evident, the People who were to receive the Money, were Generally most Concerned to have it paid them by the Commissioners of the Equivalent immediately, as being the surest Method, and so it was at last agreed.</P>
<P>The Money being thus Directed, and who should have the payment, it is not Material to take notice of the several Claims put in, Debts demanded of the Company, and Services to be rewarded, they were all matter of private Interest, and I omit them of course.</P>
<P>The Affair of the Coyn, and the Report of the Committee, I have Noted already, and as it issued in a Proclamation, and that Proclamation recited the Report of the Committee, I have inserted the whole in the <HI>Appendix N<SUP>o</SUP></HI> L x x.</P>
<P>On the Seventeenth the Act for the payment of the Capi∣tal and Interest of the <HI>African</HI> and <HI>Indian</HI> Company was read, &amp; little more but private Business was done, the Union was now Finished in <HI>England,</HI> and expected down every day, &amp; the Par∣liament, saving the dispatch of some private Bills, had no∣thing
<PB N="238" REF="525"/>
before them but the <HI>African</HI> Affair; which held them just to the end of their Time.</P>

<P>Then my Lord Commissioner made the following Speeech, <HI>viz.</HI> My Lords and Gentlemen, <HI>I have received by Her Majesties Command an Exemplification, under the Great Seal of</HI> England, <HI>of the Act past in the Parliament of that Kingdom, Ratifying the Treaty of Ʋnion in the same terms as the Treaty was past here.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Her Majesty orders it to be inserted in the Books of Parliament, and to remain with the Records of this Kingdom; for which end I have put it in my Lord Clerk Registers Hand.</HI></P>
<P>My Lords and Gentlemen, <HI>It is a great satisfaction to the Queen that the Ʋnion is thus happily concluded in Her Reign, and I'm com∣manded by Her Majesty to assure you, that nothing shall be omitted on Her part, to make the whole Island feel the good Effects of it.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And as I doubt not but the finishing of this great Affair is acceptable to you, so I hope you will study to promote a cordial Ʋnion with our Neigh∣bours, for the greater Happiness and Advantage of both Kingdoms.</HI></P>
<P>Then the Exemplification of the <HI>Act</HI> of the Parliament of <HI>Eng∣land</HI> ratifying the Treaty of Union betwixt <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>England,</HI> under the Great Seal of <HI>England,</HI> was read, and ordered to be re∣corded.</P>

<P>Now the Work drew towards a Close, the long Hopes of those People who promised themselves Doubts, Delays, and long Hesitations in <HI>England,</HI> were intirely Vanished, and People were generally surprized at, the Treaty being so readily and so summarly past in <HI>England;</HI> The Gentlemen on the other Side, had two kinds of Expectation from the Parliament of <HI>England.</HI><LIST>
<ITEM>1. Delay and length of Time, in Debating and Dis∣puting, with Amendments, <HI>Conferences,</HI> and <HI>free Con∣ferences</HI> between the Upper and Lower House of Parlia∣ment in <HI>England,</HI> according to the known Way and Usage, in Cases of such Difficulty as this was.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Amendments or Alterations, which might occasi∣on the respective Articles so Amended, to be Remitted or Returned to the Parliament of <HI>Scotland</HI> to be Recon∣sidered, by which means not the particular Articles only, but perhaps the whole Treaty might necessarily go thro' the Hands of the Parliament in <HI>Scotland</HI> again, and so the Time which began to approach, <HI>viz.</HI> The <HI>First</HI> of <HI>May,</HI> at which Time the Union was to take place, should be Elapsed; and so it might be put off to another Parliament, and the Work be to be done over again.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>But all Men were surprized, when they understood the Parliament of <HI>England</HI> had past it in the Gross, without the least Deviation, Alteration or Amendment.</P>
<P>The Additions which the <HI>English</HI> Parliament made, by inserting the Act of Security for the Church of <HI>England</HI> in the Body of the Union, agreeable to the same in <HI>Scotland,</HI> was nothing but what was provided for, according to that Clause before Noted, in these Terms, <HI>That the Parliament of</HI> Eng∣land <HI>may provide for the Security of the Church of</HI> England, <HI>as they think expedient, to take place within the said Bounds of the Kingdom of</HI> England, <HI>and not Derogating from the Security above provided, for Establishing the Church of</HI> Scotland <HI>within the Kingdom of</HI> Scotland, as <HI>per</HI> the Act of Ratification appears; which Ratification with the Exemplification as it came down from <HI>England,</HI> is at large Printed immediately after these Minutes.</P>

<HEAD>APPENDIX, Part I. Containing an Account of Transactions in both Parts of the United Kingdoms, sub∣sequent to the <HI>UNION;</HI> being an Abridg∣ment of the several Alterations made in the Laws, Trade, Customs, and Consti∣tution of both Kingdoms by the <HI>Union.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THe Union was no sonner Concluded, and the Ratifications Exchanged, as has been said, but an unlucky Business hap∣pened, that opened afresh the Mouths of those that had all along watched Occasions for that purpose, and furnished them with matter of new Clamour. The particulars are as follows;</P>
<P>The Time when the Union was to take place, was the first of <HI>May,</HI> after which, by the Fourth Article of the Treaty, the Sub∣jects of either Kingdom were to have a free Intercourse of Trade, to enjoy equal Privileges, and were to be upon an equal Foot as to Taxes, Customs, Duties, Prohibitions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as by Words of the Treaty, <HI>viz.</HI> Article 4<HI>th.</HI></P>
<Q>That all the Subjects of the Ʋnited Kingdom of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> shall, from and after the Ʋnion, have full Freedom and Intercourse of Trade and Navigation, to and from any Port or Place within the said Ʋnited Kingdom, and the Dominions and Plantations thereunto be∣longing; And that there be a Communication of all other Rights, Pri∣vileges and Advantages, which do, or may belong to the Subjects of ei∣ther Kingdom, except where it is otherways expresly agreed in these Ar∣ticles.</Q>
<P>But in the Interval of Time, between the finishing of the Treaty and the first of <HI>May,</HI> all Things by Consequence remained as they were, and all Merchandizes being Imported into <HI>Scotland</HI> upon the Foot of the former Customs, which were much Lower than in <HI>England,</HI> the Merchants in both Kingdoms laying hold of that Advantage, for their private Gain, Fraughted abundance of Ships in <HI>France</HI> and
<PB N="2" REF="563"/>
<HI>Holland</HI> with all sorts of Goods, which payed high Duties in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> Landing them in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and paying only the <HI>Scots</HI> Dues, presuming that after the first of <HI>May,</HI> they should be sent Free to <HI>England,</HI> according to the general Article of Freedom of Com∣merce.</P>
<P>To let the Reader more Exactly into this Case, I shall state the difference of the Duties of some of the several Commodities, which being thus Imported into <HI>Scotland,</HI> were after to be carried into <HI>England;</HI> such as, Wines, Brandies, Salt, Lintseed, Iron, Timber, Deals, <HI>&amp;c</HI> being the chief kinds of Goods Imported in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and which the Duties were most Complained of.</P>
<P>Besides this, it is to be observed, That the Customs of <HI>Scotland</HI> being Let in Tack, <HI>as they call it</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> or in Farm, <HI>as in England,</HI> the Tacksmen or Farmers, to Encourage the Merchants to make large Importations, made several Compositions and Abatements to them less or more, according as the Quantity of the Goods Imported, Encouraged, by this means the Customs were still reduced, and yet the Farmers of the Customs made great Gain of that Interval of Trade.</P>
<P>Another Article of the Contrivance of the Merchants on this Head, was in <HI>England,</HI> upon the Drawbacks on Foreign Goods Imported there, and Exported again by Certificate.</P>
<P>And this indeed was less Honest by far than the other, tho' both of them Politick enough; and, which was thought, had slipt the Notice of the Treaters on both sides, during the Negotiating the Treaty.</P>
<P>The Exporters in this Case, sent Goods from <HI>England</HI> to <HI>Scot∣land</HI> by Certificate, drawing back the Duties paid on their Import in <HI>England,</HI> as being sent to a Foreign Country: After the Union the Kingdoms becoming One, it was by the Treaty left open for them, to carry the same Goods back into <HI>England,</HI> and Sell them there, as if they had paid the Duty.</P>
<P>The principal Article this Circumstance relates to, was Tobacco, which paying a large Duty of near Six Pence <HI>per</HI> Pound in <HI>England,</HI> above Six Thousand Hogsheads as I have been told, <HI>(Some have said much more, even to double the Quantity, but I choose to relate the lowest Number,)</HI> was sent into <HI>Scotland,</HI> and 5 <HI>per</HI> Pound of the said Custom drawn back by the Merchant.</P>
<P>I need not acquaint the Reader, That the Exporter was both bound in a Bond with Securities, and also Sworn against the Re∣landing or returning it into <HI>England</HI> again; But as the Union gave a free Intercourse of Trade, <HI>i. e.</HI> Exporting and Importing to and from the respective Kingdoms, without paying any Duties, or any Molestation whatsoever, so their Bonds seem'd to be of no Value in that Case; But whether the Oath was of no Value to them, is ano∣ther Affair, and not for me to Determine here.</P>
<P>It is evident, the Tobacco was sent to <HI>Scotland</HI> in Quantities, so much above the usual Consumption of that Country, that it
<PB N="3" REF="564"/>
could rationally be esteemed to be with no other Prospect, than of Returning it into <HI>England</HI> again after the Union, and so to obtain the Advantage of the Drawback.</P>
<P>In like manner it is evident, the great Import into <HI>Scotland</HI> of Wines and Brandy from <HI>France,</HI> either directly, or by way of <HI>Hol∣land,</HI> was so much beyond the ordinary Consumption of the Place, that it could be with no other End, than the carrying it into <HI>Eng∣land</HI> after the Union should take place, nor did the Merchants stick to owne that to be in the Design.</P>
<P>The Merchants in <HI>London,</HI> especially such as were concerned in the Trade to <HI>Spain, Italy</HI> and <HI>Portugal,</HI> and consequently had the greatest Injury, made loud Complaints of this, as an Intolerable In∣equality, and a Thing so Unjust that they made no doubt to con∣cern the Government in it, and the Parliament being then sitting, they Addressed the House of Commons for Relief.</P>
<P>Their Address was followed with Numerous Solicitations, they even wearied the Members, the Secretaries of State, and every Body, that they thought would Espouse their Cause; that as some have Expressed it, They almost drove the House by the Force of their Clamours, upon a Debate of a Thing, which most People thought they had really no Power, <HI>at least no Reason,</HI> to meddle with.</P>
<P>The Parliament then sitting was the same, which had in Concert with the Parliament of <HI>Scotland,</HI> made this Union; And it could not seem Reasonable, That the Parliament of <HI>England</HI> in its separate Capacity, could be Qualified to Explain any part of the Articles, which were then Ratified and Recorded in both Kingdoms, and neither Parliament could Determine in Things belonging to the other, any more than they could have done before the Treaty.</P>
<P><HI>However this was,</HI> the House of Commons went upon it, great Application being made by the <HI>English</HI> Merchants, and after some Debate, came to this Resolution.<Q><HI>Resolved,</HI>
<P>That the Importation of Goods and Merchandizes of the Growth and Produce of <HI>France,</HI> and other Forreign Parts into <HI>Scotland,</HI> in order to be brought from thence into <HI>England</HI> after the first of <HI>May,</HI> and with Intention to avoid the payment of the <HI>English</HI> Duties, will be to the Damnage &amp; Ruine of the Fair Traders, to the Prejudice of the Manufactures of <HI>England,</HI> a great Loss to Her Majesties Revenue of the Customs, and a very great Detriment to the Publick.</P></Q></P>
<P>And in pursuance of this Resolution, a Bill was ordered to be brought in, the Enacting part of which I have Annexed to this Work, in the <HI>Appendsx N<SUP>o.</SUP></HI> C (3). The Title of it was as follows.<Q>A Bill to prevent the Mischiefs of a Fraudulent Practice, in obtaining Drawbacks for Goods carried from <HI>England</HI> to <HI>Scotland,</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="565"/>
in order to be brought back again; and in carrying Goods from For∣eign Parts into <HI>Scotland,</HI> in order to be brought into <HI>England,</HI> without paying the <HI>English</HI> Duties, and for better securing the Du∣ties of Goods brought from the <HI>East Indies,</HI> was (according to order) read a second time, and committed to a Committee of the whole House.</Q></P>
<P>This Bill past all the usual Forms in the House of Commons, and went up to the Lords, but after long Debate in the Ʋpper-House, the Lords rejected it.</P>
<P>It's true, that upon the Petitions and Representations of the <HI>Scots</HI> Merchants, there were long Debates, and great Difficulties in the pas∣sing this Bill in the House of Commons, and the <HI>Scots</HI> demanding <HI>by the Letter of the Treaty</HI> a free Intercourse of Trade, alledged they could not be refused the importing of any Goods out of <HI>Scotland</HI> into <HI>England,</HI> which were not by Law Counterband in <HI>Scotland</HI> before the said Treaty, since having been fairly admitted to an Entry in the Cu∣stom-house of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and all the Duties which were demanded be∣ing paid, the free Intercourse of Trade between the Nations immedi∣ately opened all the Ports of <HI>England</HI> to their Goods.</P>
<P>This Argument was too Powerful and too Plain not to have its Weight in the House: <HI>But to solve this,</HI> there was an Exception put in to the Bill for the Property of <HI>Scots</HI> Merchants, as a thing which would effectually remove their Scruples, and answer the End both of the Union one way, and of the <HI>Portugal</HI> Merchants another; For the Complaint seemed to ly not so much against the Freedom of <HI>Scots</HI> Merchants importing their own Goods, but of Forreigners, <HI>Dutch, French, Jews</HI> and <HI>English,</HI> who under the cover of <HI>Scots</HI> Men had crouded in vast Quantities of Wine and Brandy, meerly to evade paying the <HI>English</HI> Dutie, taking the Advantage of the Interval of Time, and thereby bringing their Goods to Market upon Terms vastly diffe∣ring from the course of Trade.</P>
<P>To prevent this, the Act was to provide, that all the Properties of the <HI>Scots</HI> Merchants should be exempted, and be allowed to come to <HI>England,</HI> but this was restricted in point of Proof. (1.) The <HI>onus Probandi</HI> lay upon the Merchant, in which many Niceties occurred needless to be mentioned here. (2.) None were to be reputed <HI>Scots</HI> Merchants but such as resided in <HI>Scotland,</HI> this excluded the <HI>Scots</HI> Merchants at <HI>London</HI> and in <HI>Holland,</HI> who were deeply Embarke in these Importations, and on whose Management the chief part of the Design was charged. (3.) The Proof of the Importations and Properties lay before the Commissioners of the Customs, and it was doubtful how it should be determin'd.</P>
<P>Under all these Difficulties, with other Restrictions needless here, this first Act struggl'd and past the Commons, and yet it was thought also, that had the <HI>Scots</HI> been fairly excepted they would have been well enough pleased with such a Difference, and they would have had some reason to have been so; Nor was the Exception of For∣reigners altogether unreasonable, the thing being really a Fraud in
<PB N="5" REF="566"/>
Trade, and a Hardship upon the fair Traders: But the main Ob∣jection turn'd upon another Point, <HI>viz. The Power the Parliament of</HI> England <HI>alone could have to Determine, Construe, or Explain any one of the Articles of the Ʋnion, which being made by the Concurrence of the two respective Kingdoms, could not be subject to the Cognisance of either Parliament in its separate Capacitie,</HI> and upon this Head the Lords rejected the Bill. And this being the main thing in my Obser∣vation, on which the whole Case depended, I have purposly omitted the Reasonings on that Article on either side, which were very many, referring my Reader to the Substance of the Address of the <HI>Scots</HI> Merchants to the House of Lords, and to an Observation made by an eminent Member of the Parliament, which I have added in the <HI>Ap∣pendix,</HI> in order to leave this Case as clear to Posterity as is possible, marked N<SUP>o</SUP> (<HI>D</HI>3.) and N<SUP>o</SUP> (<HI>E</HI>3.)</P>
<P>However it was absolutely necessary if possible to bring this Affair to some Conclusion, and in order to this the Parliament at that time draw∣ing near an end, for they could sit no longer than the last of <HI>April,</HI> the Union commencing the 1<HI>st.</HI> of <HI>May,</HI> wherefore it was thought expedient to give the House a short Recess, that this matter might come again upon the Stage, whereupon the Queen prorogued the Parliament for three days only, and in a short Speech made them acquainted with the Reason of it, <HI>viz.</HI> In order to find out an Expedient to prevent any Mischiefs arising to either Kingdom in the short Interval of time between that and the Commencement of the Ʋnion.</P>
<P>When the House met again, the Commons began again and voted to the same purpose as before, and ordered a Bill to be brought in in the same terms as before.</P>
<P>The Vote of the House of Commons ran thus;<Q>That the Importation of sundry Goods of the Growth of <HI>France</HI> thro' <HI>Scotland</HI> into <HI>England,</HI> with design to avoid paying the Duties payable for the same in <HI>England,</HI> is a notorious Fraud, ruinous to the fair Tra∣ders and injurious to Her Majesties Revenue.</Q></P>
<P>Ʋpon this Vote the Merchants at <HI>London</HI> renewed their Clamours, and all Methods possible were made use of to bring the Parliament in∣to it; The Government would willingly have foundout some Expe∣dient to have softned the general Complaint, and to have prevented the Injury to the Revenue, but all <HI>Mediums</HI> were found imperfect, and the House of Lords persisting in the first Scruple, it fell to the Ground.</P>
<P>While this was transacting, the Merchants went on with their Importation, and tho' the Quantity did not amount to what had been alledged <HI>would be brought in,</HI> yet it was a very great Quantity indeed, and the Damage to the Revenue in <HI>England,</HI> appears by the follow∣ing Calculation.</P>
<P>There were not some wanting in either Kingdom, who expected to make early Objections against this proceeding, as a Breach of the
<PB N="6" REF="567"/>
Union on the <HI>English</HI> side, and had the Act past, tho' with the ut∣most Precautions, discovered that they would have improved that Suggestion to the utmost, and yet it was observable that none were so forward to approve of the Act of Restriction as some Gentlemen who declared their Aversion to the Union, and their willingness to have it dissolved again.</P>
<P>Whatever Loss therefore the Government received by this Affair, they avoided the Stroke it would have given to the Union and the Enemies of the Treaty lost the Opportunity of saying it was broken.</P>
<P>The first of <HI>May</HI> being arriv'd, the <HI>Scots</HI> Merchants began to apply themselves to the Government for the Settlement of this Matter, and the Importation of their Goods to <HI>England;</HI> This held a long De bate, and took up a great deal of time, however the <HI>Scots</HI> shipped their Goods, took Certificats in <HI>Scotland</HI> of their being fairly im∣ported there before the first of <HI>May,</HI> and tho' after many Hesitations and Delays, about the middle of <HI>June</HI> the Fleet sailed for <HI>London,</HI> consisting of about 40 Sail mostly loaded with Wine and Brandy:</P>
<P>As soon as they arrived in the River of <HI>Thames,</HI> the Custom-house Officers made a general Seizure both of Ship and Goods; and all was put to a full stop.</P>
<P>This perplex'd the Merchands very much, and loud Clamours were made of it in <HI>Scotland,</HI> as a Breach of the Ʋnion; The Royal Bor∣roughs in <HI>Scotland</HI> held their Convention upon this Affair, and the Merchants concerned in the said Ships presented a Petition to them, which because it relates the Complaint in express terms, and for the Information of those People in <HI>England,</HI> who do not particularly un∣derstand the Methods there, I insert at large in the <HI>Appendix.</HI></P>
<P>It may be observed that the Royal Burghs in <HI>Scotland</HI> have their Meetings on emergent Occasions, for the Regulation of Trade, and settling their own Affairs, besides their Annual Meeting.</P>
<P>The Merchants of <HI>Scotland</HI> generally speaking are all Free-men of some one or other of these Burghs, and there hapning to be a Con∣vention or Meeting as above at that time, the Merchants presented to them their Petition, intreating them to represent their Case to the Queen, setting furth their Grievances, this Petition you will find in the <HI>Appendix</HI> N<SUP>o</SUP> <HI>A.</HI> (3.)</P>
<P>Pursuant to this Petition, the Convention of Burroughs represented their case very earnestly to the Government, by the means of the <HI>Scots</HI> Secretarys of State then at <HI>London</HI>—their Address I have also placed in the <HI>Appendix</HI> to this Work N<SUP>o</SUP> <HI>B</HI> (3)</P>
<P>And thus the Case was wholly referred to the Queen and Council.</P>
<P>It was thought hard indeed that the Ships should not be suffered to unlade, the Season being Hot, and the Wines exposed to spoil; But there was no immediate Remedy, the Custom-house Officers could not possibly do otherwise, <HI>for this Reason:</HI> Had the Debate been, what Duty they should pay, they might have suffered them to un∣lade into the Queens Ware-houses, and have detained them there till such Duty had been paid; But the Trade of <HI>France</HI> being universal∣ly
<PB N="7" REF="568"/>
Prohibit by Act of Parliament, they could not be admitted to an Entry, but were all Forfeited, both Ships and Goods.</P>
<P>The Government willing, if possible, to give the necessary Relief in this Exigence, the Attorney General, and all other Judges, whose Advice was necessary, were required to give their Opinion, but they differ'd in their Judgments so much, that no Resolution could be made in it.</P>
<P>However, that the Merchants might be made Easie, it was pro∣posed to them, That they should Land their Goods, upon Condi∣tion, that they gave Security to stand to the Judgment of the <HI>Bri∣tish</HI> Parliament; This was thought but reasonable, and some com∣plyed with it, and had their Ships Unloaden: Others refused such Securities, and their Goods lay longer, and suffered more.</P>
<P>At length a <HI>Medium</HI> was found out, which was, to let all the Merchants have the possession of their Goods, serving the Possessors of the Goods with a Writ of <HI>Devenirunt</HI> out of the Exche∣quer—; This is a kind of Write which puts the Matter in a Form of Prosecution only, that in case of further occasion, the Queen might recover her Dues, and so the Merchants had their Goods, and the Decision of it was left to Time, and to the <HI>British</HI> Parliament.</P>
<P>Thus it continued in a Course of Law, tho' not under prosecu∣cution, till the Meeting of the <HI>British</HI> Parliament, when by a Vote of the House of Commons, the whole Affair was Discharged, and all prosecutions ordered to be stopt, of which hereafter. Mean time the Clause in Parliament so much struggled about, you will find in the <HI>Appendix</HI> to this Work, <HI>N<SUP>o</SUP></HI> C (3)</P>
<P>Thus ended this difficult Matter, in which is to be Noted the Exactness of the House of Lords, and Tenderness in respect to the Union, which delivered us from the Apprehensions of an Invasion upon the Articles; and notwithstanding the Damage done to the Revenue, which was finally sacrificed to the Ease of the Peoples Minds, the whole Claim was let fall.</P>
<P>It may be thought it had this Use, however, that the Difficulty which appeared in it, Checkt the Quantity of the Goods that would otherways have been brought in, which would have been Intole∣rable, and some thought this was part of the Design in it.</P>
<P>while this was Transacting, the Government began to take the State of the Nation into their Consideration, in order to settle Things conform to the respective Constitutions, and yet to put the Union as far in Practice as the General Circumstances would admit; And this took up the most part of the Time between the first of <HI>May, when the Ʋnion took place,</HI> and the Sitting down of the first <HI>British</HI> Parliament, nor was the Thing without its Difficulties, as will appear in the several Articles following.<LIST>
<PB N="8" REF="569"/>
<ITEM>1. The Customs.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2.—The Excise.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. The Equivalent.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. Petty Justice.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. The Forces and the Coyn.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Previous to these Particulars, it is requisite to observe, That the Administration of publick. Affairs was left to remain as before, in the Ministry of a Privy Council, a Treasury, a Chancellor, and Two Secretaries of State, with all other Dependents and Substitutes as before.</P>
<P>This the Queen thought fit to Order, not only, because the Weight of Business was too great, and the particulars too Nice, and of too much Consequence to suffer a sudden Change, which would have made large Intervals in the Course of Administration, put a stop to the publick Business, and Influence private Persons Affairs also. But as the Queen has always thought it best, in such Cases, to take Advice of Her Great Council the Parliament, a Hap∣piness we have often Complained for want of in former Reigns; So it was referred to the Sitting of the <HI>British</HI> Parliament, that it might be settled, to the Satisfaction of the Nation, by the Advice of their full Representative.</P>
<P>Thus the Civil List remained as it was, the Army was sub∣sisted upon the old Establishment, and paid from the Cess granted by the Parliament of <HI>Scotland,</HI> as far as it Extended, the Defici∣ency was left to the Parliament of <HI>Britain</HI> to supply, as appears by the Act of Parliament granting the Cess.</P>
<P>On the first of <HI>May One Thousand Seven Hundred and Eight,</HI> the Army received their pay from <HI>London,</HI> the Regiment of Foot Guards was received as <HI>English</HI> Guards, and the Command of them given to the Marquiss of <HI>Lothian</HI> as Colonel; The Guards were Clothed after the <HI>English</HI> manner, I mean, as the <HI>English</HI> Guards, and the whole Establishment of the Forces received their Regulati∣ons and Pay from the <HI>British</HI> Government.</P>
<P>But two Things required an immediate Application, <HI>viz.</HI> The Customs and Excise, for these being to be Established upon a new Foot, <HI>viz.</HI> According to the Articles, and to Commence precisely on the first of <HI>May,</HI> it was absolutely necessary that they should be first settled.</P>
<P>The same Reasons made it absolutely necessary to bring down some <HI>Englishmen,</HI> to supply Inferiour Offices, both in the Customs and Excise, at least, till proper Persons might be found, or In∣structed to Act without them.</P>
<P>It was thought at first, That as <HI>Scotland</HI> being United to <HI>England,</HI> the whole United Kingdom coming under one Denomination, and under one Method of Government, so the Revenues should become
<PB N="9" REF="570"/>
united in one general Collection, that the Customs should be manag∣ed by the Commissioners at <HI>London,</HI> and under them only by Collec∣tors and other Officers in the respective Ports in <HI>Scotland</HI> as it is in <HI>En∣gland,</HI> all subservient to, and under the Government of the Commis∣sioners at <HI>London,</HI> and the like in the Excise.</P>
<P>But the Business appeared too weighty and embarrast with too many Difficulties to admit of such a Conjunction, and indeed were I to enter into an Historical Account of the Labyrinths which the first Settlement of these Duties led the Managers of them into, what Dif∣ficulties they met with, what Clamours were raised at their Conduct, however impartially they endeavoured to act, it would look as if I were going to Write of persons instead of relating things, and that is none of my business here.</P>
<P>It will be enough here to touch the matters of Fact, by which it will appear, both that the Government proceeded in the best Me∣thod, in puting the Customs and Excise into a distinct Management in <HI>Scotland;</HI> And also, that the Commissioners of both shewed they wanted neither Judgment or Application in a Settlement so speedy under such perplext Circumstances as they found these Revenues in at first.</P>
<P>The Commissioners named for the Management of the Customs were as is noted, Three <HI>English-men,</HI> Two <HI>Scots-men.</HI><LIST>

</LIST></P>
<P>The whole Extent of the Kingdom lay before them and they had not only new Officers to place in the respective Ports, but they had all their old Officers to instruct in the new Methods, Customs and Manner of securing and accounting the respective Duties.</P>
<P>This obliged the Government, even before Commissioners were named, and before the time for the new Collection began, to di∣rect five persons from <HI>England,</HI> experienced in the Methods and Ʋ∣sage of the Customs, to go down into <HI>Scotland,</HI> to put them into some manner of Order as to Exports and Imports, especially of Goods to be passed between the two Kingdoms when the Union was to take place, and of Imports which might happen before the Commission came down; As also to Regulate the Collection of the subsequent Duties, secure the Payment, and instruct the Officers; And this was about the latter end of <HI>April.</HI>—If the Disorders these Gentle∣men found the Custom-house in, the Confusion of Method and Remis∣ness of Practice was material to note in a History, it would take up a large Discourse here, and make the necessity of a new modelling the Custom house more distinctly appear.</P>
<P>These Gentlemen, tho' it was impossible to build any thing upon the Method they found things in, yet by their Diligence and Appli∣cation
<PB N="10" REF="571"/>
brought them to a little of a Form, and prepared them the bet∣ter for the Regulations which were to follow.</P>
<P>These were the following Persons.<LIST>
<ITEM>Mr <HI>Lionel Norman,</HI> (since one of the Commissioners,) from the Cu∣stom-house—at <HI>Berwick.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>Mr. <HI>Jessop Boughton,</HI> since Secretary of the Customs, from the Custom-house—at <HI>London.</HI></ITEM>

<ITEM>Mr. <HI>Warwick Arthur</HI>—from <HI>Burlington.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The first Clamour I meet with against these proceedings, was, the filling all the Commissions up with <HI>English Men</HI> and Strangers, and I mention it, not that it was a real Ground of Complaint, their Num∣ber being not one fifth Part of the whole, as appears by their Esta∣blishment; But to remark how readily every thing was laid hold upon to reproach the Ʋnion, as being either originally designed for, or consequentially improved to the particular Advantage of the <HI>English</HI> separately considered.</P>
<P>Now altho' the small Number of <HI>English</HI> imployed in the Customs, were a sufficient Answer to the Objections, and a full Justification of the <HI>English</HI> Government in that Case; yet it is a more clear Defence when it is considered that it was impossible to introduce the new Method of collection, the Rules of their keeping their several Offices, and their Accompts, which were all now to be done after the <HI>English</HI> Manner, without the Assistance of Officers from <HI>England,</HI> who had been bred up to the same Business, and were absolutely Masters of the Methods practised in <HI>England:</HI> of which by it self.</P>
<P>But to return to the Question, I mean the necessity of a separate Collection of the Customs and Excise in <HI>Scotland,</HI> it will further appear in reflecting on the Proceedings of the Officers in the prosecution of their new Methods.</P>
<P>For First, the People finding the Duties on <HI>French</HI> Goods so ex∣travagantly high, that the stealing the Customs was more worth their while than usual, sell upon that Practice with so much eagerness, that it was not in the power of the Custom-house Officers at first to sup∣press it; At, several places they practised it so openly, and with such assurance, that when the Officers had made their Seizures they were dri∣ven from them by the Rabbles, and the Goods attempted to be taken from them by force, &amp; a Fleet arriving from <HI>Holland</HI> about the Months of <HI>August</HI> or <HI>September</HI> after the Union, it was thought that several thousand small Casks of Brandy were conveyed secretly on Shore, which it was impossible to prevent: But of this I shall be more particular by and by.</P>
<P>It was time therefore to take new Methods, and the Commissio∣ners
<PB N="11" REF="572"/>
Applying themselves to the Government in this Matter, Soul∣diers were appointed to Defend the Collectors, as occasion should offer, and the Persons who had Resisted, as above, were Seized, and ordered to be prosecuted; I might give a long History here, of the Frauds and Violences put upon the Government, in the matters of the Customs, by which whole Ships Loadings of Goods were at∣tempted to be put on Shore, without paying the Custom; But this is enough to make it plain, what Occasion there was of a strict and exact Management in this Affair, and consequently of a se∣parate Commission.</P>
<P>The Business of the Customs also in <HI>Scotland,</HI> had been under a Management quite different from that in <HI>England;</HI> the Commissio∣ners sound the Trade small, the Officers few, and Discouraged, their Salaries small, and the Extent of the Ports vastly large; So that of that small Business there was in the Nation, much of it was carried on by the Clandestine Management of the Merchant, and tho' the Farmers or Tacksmen did their utmost, with the Officers they had, yet it was impossible to prevent the Running great Quantities of Goods.</P>
<P>If this was a General Practice before, much more was it so now, when the Sweetness of it was Tasted by the Merchants after the Union, when the Duty of Wine and Brandy, was about Five times to Eight times as much as it was before. This added to the Inconveni∣encies the Custom-House at first laboured under, made it impossible to put a stop to the Irregular Practice of the Merchants, the Firths of <HI>Forth</HI> and <HI>Clyde,</HI> are known to be very large, and the whole Kingdom full of Creiks, Coves, Harbours and Bays, that unless a little Army of Officers had been maintained, it was not possible they could easily check the running Goods on Shore, where there was so great a Temptation and Opportunity.</P>
<P>But in order to Rectifie this as much as possible, Riding Officers were appointed to Survey the Coast, these were Useful to observe the Officers, that they did their Duty, and withal, to Inform the Commissioners of what happened, to Regulate the Ports, and Di∣rect the fixing Officers in proper places.</P>
<P>These consisted of Four general Riding Surveyors, who dividing the whole Kingdom in proper Districts, had Twelve Riding Officers under them. Three to each Surveyor, these were subject to the Or∣ders and Inspection of the first Four, and all subject to the General Orders of the Commissioners themselves, as they found occasion; Nor did the Commissioners themselves stick, as they found the Ser∣vice required it, to take a personal Inspection into the Business of the Customes at their first Planting, frequently making long Jour∣neys themselves, to Visit the Coast, and Rectifie such Abuses as they found requisite, which tho' not usual, they made no Difficulty to do, at the first Settlement of this nice Branch of the Revenue.</P>
<P>Several Cruising Vessels also &amp; small Boats were built, <HI>For the Custom-House Officers were intirely without them before,</HI> by which they were
<PB N="12" REF="573"/>
able to Visit and Search Ships as they appeared, at any Time, in the Sea, off of the Ports, or in all the Creiks and Rivers as there was occasion—; for want of which, it was frequent∣ly practised, for Ships to appear at a distance, make Signals for their Confederates, who came off in Boats, and so delivered the Goods they designed to Run, before they came into Port; These Boats particularly in the Firth of <HI>Forth,</HI> having the whole Firth to Range in, had their appointed Signals also on the Shores, where∣by they never failed to have Notice, if the Officers appeared, and could shift from Port to Port, or from one side of the Firth to the other, till they had a clear Port to Land in; and the Custom-House Officers might have the Satisfaction to stand on the Shore, and look on, but having no Vessel or Boat to go off in, could not pre∣vent the Fraud.</P>
<P>But this was intirely prevented by the Vigilance of the Com∣missioners, who placed their Cruising Vessels in proper Stations on the Sea, and their several smaller Boats in the Rivers, Creiks and Ports; and these concurred together with the Riding Officers and Surveyors on Shore, who, in their constant Circuits, answered ex∣actly by Land, what the said Vessels did on the Sea—; By the Exactness of this Method, the Affair of the Customs presently came into Form, and Things looked with a new Face in Trade, to the Satisfaction of Fair Traders, and the better Collecting and securing the Duties.</P>
<P>And for the better Explaining the particular Management of the Customs in <HI>Scotland</HI> as to this Point, and giving a Proof of what I have Noted as above, I have added a brief Scheme of the several Stations of the said Cruisers by Sea, their appointed Business, and Original Coasts, together with the Stations of the Riding Officers on Shore, which will be found <HI>Appendix</HI> Part 11. N<SUP>o.</SUP> (R x x, S x x.) and to which the Reader is referred; a Scheme also of the Difference of several Duties before and after the Union, from which the Encouragement for these Disorders were drawn; These you will find <HI>Appendix</HI> Part 11. N<SUP>o.</SUP> (T x x, V x x, X x x.)</P>
<P>I have been the longer on this, as well to give the true Reasons, why it was absolutely necessary to place <HI>English</HI> Officers in <HI>Scot∣land,</HI> in order to Regulate the Collection, as why it was absolute∣ly necessary to have a distinct Commission in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and this will always hold to be a Reason for such a Method; It being Im∣practicable, that all the variety of Cases which shall happen there, should be Determined by the Board at <HI>London,</HI> or left to the Arbi∣trary Decision of single Collectors; And this was one Reason among others, why the Parliament found it necessary, to have a Court of Exchequer Established in <HI>Scotland,</HI> in which all the Seizures, Confiscations, and Pleas between the Merchant and the Custom-House Officers, should be Determined, since it would have been an insupportable Grievance, both to the Queen as well as to the Subject; to the first, to have had such Pleas be Determined in the Ordinary Methods of the Law. And to the second, to have been
<PB N="13" REF="574"/>
obliged to Defend themselves in <HI>England,</HI> whither Witnesses must have been sent, and the Defendants have been bound to have ap∣peared upon every trifling Occasion; Of which by it self.</P>
<P>As the Customs were thus necessarily put under a separate Col∣lection, so was the Excise—; that Branch of the Revenue was not without its Difficulties, and as there would be every day Nice∣ties and Difficulties arising, which no Government could Foresee; So it would have been too great a Neglect of <HI>Scotland,</HI> to have put the Determination of that whole Branch of the Revenue, into the Hands of single Collectors.</P>
<P>Again, the Disputes in the Excise in <HI>England,</HI> being referred wholly to the Justices of the Peace, and at the first settling this Duty, there being no Justices of the Peace settled in <HI>Scotland,</HI> it would too much have Exposed the Subject, to have left them to the Arbitrary Decision of Inferiour Collectors, and too much have Exposed the Government to have left the Queen, without a due Power to have secured the Revenue.</P>
<P>But there was yet other Reasons, which made the Establishing separate Commissions in <HI>Scotland</HI> for the Revenue, as above, to be absolutely necessary, and this was the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Articles of the Union, which appointed the Laws of <HI>Scotland</HI> to remain in Force as they were—; One Consequence of this Ar∣ticle, was, That all the Pleas of the Crown, as well as all Matters of private Right, became Cognoscable only in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and to be Judged by what was before, or was now to be Deem'd, the Law of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>Hence it appeared absolutely necessary, to have Two new Courts Erected in <HI>Scotland,</HI> That is to say, New in Method, tho' not in Name, <HI>viz.</HI> a Court of Admiralty, and a Court of Exchequer; The first to Determine Maritime Disputes, the other, such as related to the Receipt of the Revenue, as Seizures, Forfeitures Penal∣ties, Crown Lands, Leases, Grants, Patents, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and whatever De∣mands the Sovereign had upon the Subjects.</P>
<P>It was expresly stipulated in the Twenty Fourth Article of the U∣nion; <HI>That a Seal in</HI> Scotland <HI>after the Ʋnion be always kept and made use of in all things relating to private Rights or Grants, which have usually passed the Great Seal of</HI> Scotland, <HI>and which only concern Offices, Grants, Commissions, and private Rights within that King∣dom; And that, until such Seal shall be appointed by Her Majesty, the present Great Seal of</HI> Scotland <HI>shall be used for such Purposes; And that the Privy Seal, Signet, Casset, Signet of the Justiciary Court, Quarter-Seal, and Seals of Courts now used in</HI> Scotland <HI>be continued.</HI></P>
<P>By this Clause, all Grants, Patents, Commissions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> were ne∣cessarily to be past in <HI>Scotland</HI>—; By this Clause also it became ne∣cessary, that there should be a distinct Keeper of the Seal, and a distinct Keeper of the Signet in <HI>Scotland,</HI> tho' there was but one Lord Chancellor.</P>
<P>Again, by the Eighteenth Article, it was expresly stipulated; <HI>That the Laws concerning Regulation of Trade, Customs, and such</HI>
<PB N="14" REF="575"/>
<HI>Excises, to which</HI> Scotland <HI>is, by virtue of this Treaty, to be lyable, be the same in</HI> Scotland, <HI>from and after the Ʋnion as in</HI> England; <HI>And that all other Laws, in use within the Kingdom of</HI> Scotland, <HI>do after the Ʋnion, and notwithstanding thereof, remain in the same Force as before, (except such as are contrary to, or inconsistent with the Terms of this Treaty) but alterable by the Parliament of</HI> Great-Britain, <HI>with this Difference betwixt the Laws concerning Publick Right, Policy, and Civil Government, and those which concern private Right; That the Laws which concern publick Right, Policy, and Civil Government, may be made the same throughout the whole united Kingdom; But that no Alteration be made in Laws which concern private Rights, except for evident Ʋtility of the Subjects within</HI> Scotland.</P>
<P>This drove the Treaters to the absolute necessity of Forming all those Particulars of the Nineteenth Article, which are but the Ex∣planation of the Eighteenth; <HI>That the Court of Session, or Colledge of Justice, do after the Ʋnion, and notwithstanding thereof, remain in all time coming within</HI> Scotland <HI>as it is now Constituted by the Laws of that Kingdom, and with the same Authority and Privileges as before the Ʋnion.</HI></P>
<P>This settled the Laws of private Right; Then the Court of Ad∣miralty comes, as a Consequence of the second Clause, as follows; <HI>And that all</HI> Admiralty Jurisdictions <HI>be under the Lord High</HI> Admiral <HI>or</HI> Commissioners <HI>for the</HI> Admiralty <HI>of</HI> Great-Britain <HI>for the time be∣ing; And that the</HI> Court <HI>of</HI> Admiralty <HI>now Established in</HI> Scotland <HI>be continued, and that all Reviews, Reductions, or Suspensions, of the Sentences in Maritime Cases competent to the Jurisdiction of that</HI> Court, <HI>remain in the same manner after the</HI> Union, <HI>as now in</HI> Scotland, <HI>until the</HI> Parliament <HI>of</HI> Great-Britain <HI>shall make such Regulations and Alte∣rations, as shall be judged Expedient for the whole Ʋnited Kingdom, so as there be always continued in</HI> Scotland <HI>a</HI> Court <HI>of</HI> Admiralty, <HI>such as is in</HI> England, <HI>for Determination of all Maritime Cases relating to private Rights in</HI> Scotland, <HI>competent to the Jurisdiction of the</HI> Admi∣ralty Court, <HI>subject nevertheless to such Regulations and Alterations, as shall be thought proper to be made by the Parliament of</HI> Great-Britain; <HI>And that the Heretable Rights of Admiralty and Vice-Admiralties in</HI> Scotland <HI>be Reserved to the Respective Proprietors as Rights of Property, subject nevertheless, as to the manner of Exercising such Heretable Rights.</HI></P>
<P>That all Pleas of Right, whether in private Right or Pleas of the Crown, were Cognisable only in <HI>Scotland,</HI> is proved by the same Article, in the following words; <HI>And that no Causes in</HI> Scotland <HI>be Cognoscable by the Courts of</HI> Chancery, Queens-bench, Common-Pleas, <HI>or any other Court in</HI> Westminster-Hall; <HI>and that the said Courts, or any other of the like Nature, after the Ʋnion, shall have no Power to Cognosce, Review, or Alter the Acts or Sentences of the Judicatures with∣in</HI> Scotland, <HI>or to stop the Execution of the same.</HI></P>
<P>The Exchequer as a further Consequence follows next, in these words; <HI>And that there be a Court of Exchequer in</HI> Scotland <HI>after the Ʋnion, for Deciding Questions concerning the Revenues of Customs and Excises there, having the same Power and Authority in such Cases, as</HI>
<PB N="15" REF="576"/>
<HI>the Court of Exchequer has in</HI> England; <HI>And that the said Court of Exchequer in</HI> Scotland <HI>have Power of passing Signatures, Gifts, Tu∣tories, and in other Things, as the Court of Exchequer at present in</HI> Scotland <HI>hath; And that the Court of Exchequer that now is in</HI> Scotland <HI>do remain, until a new Court of Exchequer be settled by the Parliament of</HI> Great-Britain <HI>in</HI> Scotland <HI>after the Union.</HI></P>
<P>By these particular Establishments may be seen not only the manner of the publick Management in <HI>Scotland,</HI> but the Reason of it, and from whence it became necessary to have the Court of Exchequer, the Commissions, and the separate Collection of the Publick Revenue settled in <HI>Scotland,</HI> all flowing from this main Original stated in the Treaty, <HI>viz.</HI> That all Causes between the Queen and the Subject are only cognisable in <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>According to this Foundation, the Collections for the Customs and Excises were settled in <HI>Scotland</HI> in distinct Commissions, as has been said, and tho' at first the Difficulties in the said Collections ap∣peared great, and some uneasiness on every side began to rise, yet as they principally lay on the backwardness of the Subject to come under a strict Survey as to the Duties, Time wore off these Things, and the People became more sensible of the Necessity of the exact Collection, in order to bring Trade to an Equality.</P>
<P>At the beginning, the People thought every Seizure of prohibited Goods a Violence upon their Properties, and clamoured at the <HI>En∣glish</HI> and the Ʋnion; as if the Union had been made not to bring them under good Government, but to leave them without Govern∣ment. Ʋpon this Notion they fell to running of Brandy in particu∣lar at that prodigious Rate, that some thousands of small Casks of Brandy was in spight of all the Vigilance of Officers secretly supposed to be put on Shore out of the first <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet that came to <HI>Scot∣land</HI> after the Union; and when the Officers made Seizure of several Parcels, the Rabbles by Violence rescued them again, as is already noted above.</P>
<P>But this Practice was easily supprest, for not the Government only, but all the fair Merchants were concerned in it, since the running of Goods on Shore, without paying Custom, is a known prejudice to the Merchant, who entring his Goods fairly, and paying large Customs, is by these People under-sold, and the Market forestal'd; These things therefore began to meet with less Encouragement, and having no Countenance but from the meer Rabble, the frequent Losses they met with, by the activity of the Officers of the Customs by little and litle, discouraged the Adventurers, and Trade began to run in it's proper Channel.</P>
<P>The Difficulties of the Excise were of another kind; Of which by themselves; And tho' the Rules of the Collecting the Excise, &amp; the Methods of charging the Subject were very exact and regular, yet they were not without great Obstructions in their Work, as has been noted. The first by reason of a Misunderstanding of the Sense of the Article in the Ʋnion, settling the Duty of Excise, which having ex∣prest the several Measures, not very exactly, admitted a double Con∣struction as to the Quantity what was to be esteemed the <HI>English</HI>
<PB N="16" REF="577"/>
Barrel: The Commissioners had charged it one way, and the Brewers demanded it another, as follows.</P>
<P>The Act expresses it thus.<Q>VII. That all the parts of the united Kingdom be for ever and after the Union, Liable to the same Excises upon all exciseable liquors, excepting only that the thirty four Gallons <HI>English</HI> to the Barrel of Beer or Ale, amounting to Twelve Gallons <HI>Scots</HI> present measure, sold in <HI>Scot∣land</HI> by the Brewer at nine shilling six pence <HI>Sterling</HI> excluding all Du∣ties, and retailed including Duties on the Retailers profit, at two pence the <HI>Scots</HI> Pint, or eight part of the <HI>Scots</HI> Gallon, be not after the Union lyable on account of the present Excise upon Exciseable Liquors in <HI>England,</HI> to any higher Imposition than two shillings <HI>Sterling</HI> upon the foresaid thirty four Gallons <HI>English</HI> Measure being twelve Gallons the present <HI>Scots</HI> Measure, and that the Excise settled in <HI>England</HI> on all other Liquors when the Union Commences, take place throughout the whole united Kingdom.</Q></P>
<P>When the Excise Office came to Charge the Brewer upon this Cause, they could reckon it no otherwise than as in <HI>England,</HI> by the Gauge of Thirty Four Gallons <HI>English</HI> to the Barrel; And thus the Brewer stood Charged for some Time.</P>
<P>But the Brewers objected, and sticking to the Letter of the Article demanded, to pay but 2 <HI>sh.</HI> for 12 <HI>Scots</HI> Gallons, whether it over-run the <HI>English</HI> 34 Gallons or no.</P>
<P>This occasioned some small Debate, but the Prudence of the Com∣missioners prevented the Clamour some People would willingly have raised upon it, and the Justices of Peace directing 1/17. in each Thirty Four Gallons to be allowed, the Brewer for the present left it Undetermined till the Parliament should settle it; And thus the Brewers were made Easie; It is to be ob∣served, to the Honour of the persons employed in the first Settle∣ment of the Excise in <HI>Scotland;</HI> That considering the Ignorance of the most part of their Officers in the Art of Gauging, and in the new Methods of taking the Worts, and making a Charge, conside∣ring the Difficulty of satisfying and convincing the People who were to pay the Duty, that they had no wrong done them, they them∣selves being unable to examine the Gaugers Accounts, no Duty was ever settled with so little Noise, or with so few Complaints, not one person that ever I could hear of having any Appeal from the Commissioners Sentences, or making any Complaint of Injustice done them; But the Collection went on easie, was collected quietly, paid cheerfully, and visibly improved the Revenue, tho' nothing was paid by the Brewer more than they paid before.</P>
<P>Nor had it been possible to collect this Duty legally, if it had not been so, for the Commissioners of the Excise laboured under another Difficulty which none of the other Branches of the Revenue were troubled with, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Laws of Collection being by the Ʋnion to be the same as in <HI>England,</HI> and the Justices of the Peace being by the Act of Parliament 12. <HI>Carol.</HI> II. in <HI>England</HI> made Judges between the Queen and the Subject, in cases of Dispute; from
<PB N="17" REF="578"/>
the beginning of the Ʋnion till about <HI>August</HI> 1708, which was 15 Months, they were without the Assistance of Justices to determine those Disputes.</P>
<P>There was indeed a Nomination of Justices by the Privy Council of <HI>Scotland</HI> 15 <HI>August</HI> 1707, as will appear in its place, and for some few Months they did meet and Act; But this was a new Set∣tlement, and the Centlemen named were yet young in their Business, little help could be had from them, and which was still worse be∣fore they had time to inform themselves, their Power died by the Act of Paliament in <HI>England,</HI> dissolving the Privy Council in <HI>Scotland.</HI> This Act past in the beginning of the first <HI>British</HI> Parliament, and by the Ceasing of that Power, from whence those Justices derived, the Power of the Justices also Ceased; and they were now to receive new Commissions from the Lord Chancellor of <HI>Britain,</HI> as the Justices in <HI>England</HI> also did—; This was not Finished till <HI>August</HI> 1708; so that in all that Time, the Commissioners of the Excise had no legal Authority before whom they could Convict any Offender, or punish any Breach of the Law, or by whom any Case could be Determined.</P>
<P>Yet their Business went on, and no Complaint was heard against their Management, no Appeal made against them, no Difficulties but what they work'd thro', to the general satisfaction.</P>
<P>The Excise as well as Customs in <HI>Scotland</HI> had been Farmed out; or Let in Tack, <HI>as they call it,</HI> the Tacksmen or Farmers did their best—, for their own Interest; But several Circumstances rendred their Method of Collecting the Excise, unfit to be Imitated, such as their Officers, <HI>who were intirely ignorant of the Art of Gauging,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a∣king the lengths of the Worts by Guess, &amp; proving Quantities chiefly by the Oaths of the Brewers and the like, which joyned with some other Practices, I care not to mention, exposed both the Collectors and the Brewers to several Inconveniencies, and in General, made the Charge on the Brewer many ways Unequal—; a Thing prejudicial not to the Duty only, but to the Fair Dealer particular∣ly, who always suffers by the Frauds and Connivances of others.</P>
<P>On this account when the first of <HI>May</HI> came, &amp; the Union taking place, the new Duty was to begin, the Government found themselves ne∣cessitated to send down a great many Officers into <HI>Scotland,</HI> if possible, to put Things into some Order, and prepare the People for the new Method of Collection—; What Treatment these Officers received in <HI>Scotland,</HI> how ill the People there used them, and how little they were able to do, will best appear by this, That the Government found themselves obliged by Proclamation, to let the Duty go on for some Time in the same Methods, and Collected by the same Officers, till the new Methods could be prepared.</P>
<P>Nor was this all, for tho' the new Commission was formed as soon as possible, for the Commissioners began to Act on the 9<HI>th</HI> of
<PB N="18" REF="579"/>
<HI>June,</HI> yet they had the whole Kingdom to Regulate as to the Col∣lection, all their Officers to Instruct, both as to Method and to Act; The first relating to the Accounts, and the last as to Gauging, not an Officer in the whole Kingdom, understanding the use of the Gauging Rod, as is Noted already, nor the People knowing the Meaning of it.</P>
<P>This makes the Difficulty of Settling the Excise in <HI>Scotland</HI> ap∣pear, and indeed who ever considers the manner of Collection be∣fore the Union, as before; will Wonder, how it was possible ever to bring the Business into any Order, for the People being most intolerably Averse at first, to the new Regulations, raised innume∣rable Clamours at the Officers that came from <HI>England,</HI> as Imposing Novelties on them, and confounding their Business—; And here, as well as in the Customs, the Clamour against <HI>Englishmen</HI> being imployed, was laid hold of, but the Conduct of the Com∣missioners here likewise effectually Answered that Pretence, for no sooner had the Officers, sent by the Commissioners in <HI>England,</HI> as above, done the Work they came about, <HI>viz.</HI> in Directing and Instructing the Officers in <HI>Scotland,</HI> but the greatest part of them were sent back again, and so few <HI>Englishmen</HI> remained in the Excise, that it is not worth Naming.</P>
<P>The Names of the Commissioners as settled after some few Alte∣rations were as follows<LIST>
<ITEM><HI>Alexander Wetherburn</HI> Esquire.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>John Montgomery</HI> Esquire.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>John Whittham</HI> Esquire.</ITEM>

<P>Nor was the Duty of Excise as a Revenue without its Discourage∣ments, <HI>as well as the Customs,</HI> the Article of Private Rights, reserved by the Union, had of course brought several Exemptions upon them, some of which have proved very considerable Hindrances to the Duty.</P>
<P>The Commissioners however, Disputed with some of those People who claim'd Exemptions of Duty, and the Debate on those Heads, lay Undetermined before the Barons of Exchequer, at the Writing these Sheets.</P>
<P>Under all these Discouragements, yet the Collection went on, and the Brewers soon became Satisfied with the manner of Charging the Excise, <HI>viz.</HI> by Gauging, as the most Equal, Indifferent, and Un∣deniably certain; and, as a method no Man could be Wronged by—; Which giving them all an Equality with one another; was very much the Advantage of the Fair Traders—, who always Suffer by the Frauds of Clandestine Dealing.</P>
<P>Nay, this was evident by the Brewers themselves, who differing with the City of <HI>Edinburghs</HI> Assessors, about the Taxes paid to the
<PB N="19" REF="580"/>
City, endeavoured to have the City Officers, Charge them by the Gauging Rod, as in the Excise, but could not obtain it.</P>
<P>I have insisted upon the Difficulties of settling these Things, to show the World the absolute Necessity, of placing the Collection of the Revenue in <HI>Scotland,</HI> distinct from that in <HI>England;</HI> And also, as a Thing needful, to show by what Steps the several Offices ar∣rived to that Order and Exactness, which they now appeared to be Managed in.</P>
<P>I come now to the Affair of the Equivalent.</P>
<P>The Calculations and Proportions between the Nations, <HI>being the Ground from whence it became payable to Scotland;</HI> I have gone thro' already, as distinctly as I can, in the several Observations on the Minutes of the Treaty, first at <HI>London,</HI> and after, in the Parliament of <HI>Scotland;</HI> We are now come to the payment of it.</P>
<P>The Parliament had Determined, both how it should be Dis∣posed of, and who should Dispose it, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Queen should Name Commissioners to Receive and Issue out the said Money, according to the Terms of the Union; This you have expresly in the Fifteenth Article of the Union, as concluded at <HI>London,</HI> as follows; <HI>And it is agreed, That Her Majesty be Impowered to appoint Commissioners, who shall be accountable to the Parliament of</HI> Great-Britain, <HI>for disposing the said Summe of three hundred, ninety eight thousand, eighty five Pounds, ten Shillings, and all other Moneys which shall arise to</HI> Scotland, <HI>upon the Agreements aforesaid, to the purposes before-mentioned: Which Commissioners shall be Impowered to call for, Receive, and Dispose of the said Moneys in manner aforesaid, and to inspect the Books of the several Collectors of the said Revenues, and of all other Duties, from whence an Equivalent may arise; And that the Collectors and Managers of the said Revenues and Duties be obliged to give to the said Commissioners subscribed Authentick Abbreviates of the Produce of such Revenues and Duties arising in their respective Districts; And that the said Commissioners shall have their Office within the Limits of</HI> Scotland, <HI>and shall, in such Office, keep Books containing Accounts of the Amount of the Equivalents, and how the same shall have been disposed of from time to time, which may be inspected by any of the Sub∣jects who shall desire the samen.</HI></P>
<P>The Queen, pursuant to this Power, appointed Commissioners for the Management of the Equivalent, and the Money being raised by Parliament, lay ready in the Bank of <HI>England.</HI></P>

</LIST> </P>
<P>The Four Merchants of <HI>London</HI> were Named, because as Members of the Bank of <HI>England,</HI> they were required to be pre∣sent upon the Spot, in order to support the Credit of the Bank, in case any Body had scrupled their Bills; And indeed there was Oc∣casion sufficient for their being there, as will appear presently.</P>
<P>It was now the beginning of <HI>July,</HI> and the Money was not yet come away from <HI>London;</HI> It would be Endless to Record here, the Scandalous Reflections spread about, of the Delay of Payment, and how the <HI>English</HI> having secured the main Point, would pay the Money when they pleased, or perhaps never; and some ran it up to that Height, as to say, That the <HI>English</HI> Designed to Cheat them of the Money.</P>
<P>Again, another sort of People pretended the Union was broke, because the Money was not paid by the first of <HI>May,</HI> and there was a Discourse of some Gentlemen, who came up to the Cross of <HI>Edin∣burgh,</HI> and Protested in the Name of the whole <HI>Scots</HI> Nation, That the Conditions of the Treaty being not complyed with, and the
<PB N="21" REF="582"/>
Terms performed, the whole was Void, and <HI>Scotland</HI> was again Free, when ever an Occasion offered, to lay hold of that Freedom—; That some People were so weak to Talk thus, and that a certain Gentleman was Foolish enough, to make such a Formal Protestation, I have some Reason to believe; But that D— <HI>H—</HI> was the Man, I profess not to know, and believe, that Noble Person to understand the Nature of the Treaty, and the Nature of Protest∣ing also, better than so.</P>
<P>Be it as it will, such Protestation was of no use, neither could it have any Signification, being made purely without Ground, the Treaty having no where Tyed up the Government of <HI>England,</HI> to have the Money actually in <HI>Scotland</HI> by such a Day—; Nor was <HI>England</HI> by the Treaty, under any Obligation to a Day of Payment; But Two Things prescribed the payment, and a Third clears it all most effectually.</P>
<P N="1">1. That by the Custom of <HI>England,</HI> any payment Contracted for, <HI>sine Die,</HI> becomes a <HI>Debt Demander,</HI> or payable at Demand; and so the Day being not prefixt in the Articles, the Money became pre∣sently due, <HI>viz.</HI> the first of <HI>May,</HI> but under no Forfeiture on delay of Days, much less a Dissolution of Articles.</P>
<P N="2">2. But if this Nicety had been insisted on, then it is Answered, That the Money was actually payed by <HI>England,</HI> being delivered by the Treasury to a certain Number of the Commissioners, appointed for receiving the Equivalent, and this, either upon or before the first of <HI>May;</HI> And tho' it was not actually come down into <HI>Scotland,</HI> yet if it was delivered in <HI>London,</HI> to the proper Persons appointed to receive it, the Government of <HI>England</HI> was fairly acquitted of the payment—; And this is to be seen by the said Commissioners Receipt in the Exchequer in <HI>England,</HI> when the Money was paid.</P>
<P N="3">3. But a third Clause shewed all this to be an Insignificant and a most Ignorant Pretence, for the Equivalent was actually paid, and made good to <HI>Scotland,</HI> before the Treaty was concluded, and it was expresly stipulated so to be Ordered, in the Fifteenth Article, in these words; <HI>It is agreed, that</HI> Scotland <HI>shall have an Equivalent for what the Subjects thereof shall be so charged towards payment of the said Debts of</HI> England, <HI>in all particulars whatsoever, in manner fol∣lowing,</HI> viz. <HI>That before the Ʋnion of the said Kingdoms, the Summe of three hundred, ninety eight thousand and eighty five pound ten shil∣lings be granted to Her Majesty by the Parliament of</HI> England, <HI>for the Ʋses after-mentioned, being the Equivalent, to be answered to</HI> Scotland <HI>for such parts of the said Customs and Excises upon all Exciseable Li∣quors, with which that Kingdom is to be charged upon the Ʋnion, as will be applicable to the payment of the said Debts of</HI> England, <HI>accord∣ing to the Proportions which the present Customs in</HI> Scotland, <HI>being Thirty thousand Pounds</HI> per Annum, <HI>do bear to the Customs in</HI> Eng∣land, <HI>computed at one Million, three hundred, forty one thousand, five hundred and fifty nine Pounds</HI> per Annum: <HI>And which the present Ex∣cises on Exciseable Liquors in</HI> Scotland, <HI>being thirty three thousand and</HI>
<PB N="22" REF="583"/>
<HI>five hundred Pounds</HI> per Annum, <HI>do bear to the Excises on Exciseable Liquors in</HI> England, <HI>computed at nine hundred, forty seven thousand, six hundred and two Pounds</HI> per Annum; <HI>Which Summe of three hundred, ninety eight thousand, eighty five Pounds, ten Shillings, shall be due and payable from the time of the Ʋnion;</HI></P>
<P>It is evident from this Article, That the Security Demanded by <HI>Scotland,</HI> for the payment of this Money, was, <HI>That the Parliament of</HI> England <HI>should raise the Sum agreed, and should grant it to Her Ma∣jesty, for the Ʋses in that Fifteenth Article Expressed,</HI> That is in short, <HI>That the Parliament should grant to Her Majesty such a Sum of Money, and appropriate it to the payment of the Equivalent</HI>—; This really was payment, and was so Accepted, and the Money being Granted to the Queen, was nothing but as a Deposite in a Third Hand, till the Ratification of the Treaty should pass in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and be Confirmed in <HI>England,</HI> or till the Union should take place, WHEN, AND AS SOON AS that was done, the Money was actually the Right, the proper Goods of the <HI>Scots,</HI> and the Go∣vernment of <HI>England</HI> could not have kept it back, no tho' the Treaty had been <HI>afterward</HI> Dissolved, or broken; So that the Ob∣jection against the payment of the Equivalent, <HI>in Time,</HI> Dyes, and falls to the Ground, in this, That it was actually payed by <HI>England</HI> before the Union began, and plac'd in such Hands as a Trust, to be at the Demand of the <HI>Scots,</HI> as soon as the Union took place, <HI>Due and payable from the Time of the Ʋnion,</HI> are the Words of the Article—; As soon therefore as the Union took place, the Treasury of <HI>England</HI> became Debitor to <HI>Scotland,</HI> for such a Sum of Money—; But the Parliament of <HI>England,</HI> with whom the Treaty was made, were Discharged of the Payment, as soon as ever the Act of Appropriation was past in the House.</P>
<P>This, I think, is clear, and admits of no Dispute, but it shows the Weakness of those People, that promised themselves any thing from the delay of the Money coming into <HI>Scotland</HI>—; Nor did their Error cease here, for when the Money came, they were not at all better pleased, but raised new Clamours at the Union—, and really went to that Height in their Reproaches, that it seemed as if they had yet latent Expectations of raising a new Tumult.</P>
<P>It was indeed something remarkable here, and not a few People took notice of it, That the very same People, who just before Ex∣claimed at the <HI>English,</HI> for not paying the Money, and cried out they were Cheated, and the Union broken, were the same—, who, when the Money came, made as much Noise on the other hand of being Bought and Sold, &amp; that Money being the Price of their Countrey.</P>
<P>The Violence of this Temper appearing so openly, I can not be counted partial in giving a true Account of it, since I could not be Faithful to the Matters of Fact, if I Omitted it.</P>
<P>On the Day of <HI>August</HI> the Money came to <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> in Twelve Waggons, Guarded by a Party of <HI>Scots</HI> Dragoons, and was carried directly to the Castle; If I omit to enter into the De∣tail
<PB N="23" REF="584"/>
of the Reproaches and Railings at the poor Innocent People that brought it, nay, at the very Horses that drew the Carriages, it is, because it was a Folly below Reproof, and rather deserves Pity.</P>
<P>If I omit Naming a known Person, in no concealed Station, who was for having the Dragoons that Guarded it, Hanged for bring∣ing it in—; And being asked, What he would have the poor Men do with it? Answered, They should have cut all them that brought it to pieces, and kept the Money from coming into the Countrey: If I omit Naming this Gentleman, it is in respect to his Character, and in hopes he may live to be Wiser, and to acknow∣ledge his inconsiderate Rashness.</P>
<P>The Waggons, as is Noted, were driven directly to the Castle, and the Money Lodged there, to be issued in its Course—; The People set on by proper Engines, shewed their Dissatisfaction at first, by rudely Stoning the poor Carters and Drivers, and Two or Three were very much hurt by Stones, as they came back with their Horses from the Castle.</P>
<P>But this was but the Remains of the Tumultuous Temper, we have been taking Notice of before, and the poor Ignorant People Acting only from outward appearances, without Consideration—, grew Calm again of course—; Nor among the most Malecontent persons could I ever find any, that when the Money upon the <HI>Afri∣can</HI> Stock came to be paid, would think the <HI>Species</HI> Unhallowed, enough to refuse their share of it.</P>
<P>As soon as the Money was Arrived, the Commissioners for the Equivalent began to Sit, and immediately applyed themselves to the Distribution of it according to the Terms of the Treaty—; And having set a parta due Proportion for the Expence of the Coinage, they went immediately to Work with the <HI>African</HI> Stock, and began to pay off.</P>
<P>Yet I must not Omit a Difficulty here, that had almost put the Affair to a full stop for a while—, and this was from the <HI>Species</HI> of the Money they had brought; The Case was as follows.</P>
<P>The Bank of <HI>England</HI> had that year, upon an Advance of a Sum of Money to the Government, received 1200000 <HI>libs.</HI> or there abouts, in Exchequer Bills—, which being made Current by the Credit, both of the Government in publick, and after by the Bank in particular, they presumed would pass in payment, as common paper Credit usually did in <HI>London,</HI> without Interest, being always payable at demand by the Bank in <HI>London,</HI> this they expected should go down without any Difficulty in <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>But the Bank seemed under some Mistake as to the Extent of their Reputation, or at least as to the Circumstances of <HI>Scotland,</HI> when they proposed the putting off these Exchequer Bills there.</P>
<P>However, they ventur'd, and sending only 100000 <HI>lib:</HI> in ready Money, in the Waggons mentioned before, the other 298085 <HI>lib.</HI> 10 <HI>shillings</HI>—, was sent down in this Paper Credit or Exchequer Bills.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="585"/>
This raised a new Clamour in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and abundance of People run away with it, that the <HI>English</HI> Trick'd them; that they had sent them Paper in stead of Money, that the great Argument formerly used to perswade <HI>Scotland</HI> to the Union, to take upon them a share of the Burden of the <HI>English</HI> Debts, and to accept of an Equivalent, was the great Advantage that should accrue to <HI>Scotland,</HI> by the Circulating of so much ready Money in the Nation—; And that now they were to be put off with Bills payable 300 Miles off, and which if Lostor Mislaid, or by Accident Burnt, were Irrecoverable.</P>
<P>The Truth is, The Bank of <HI>England</HI> took a wrong step here—; For <HI>First,</HI> They ventured upon <HI>Scotland</HI> with their Bills in stead of Money, without Consulting either the Temper or the Circumstances of <HI>Scotland</HI> at that Time.</P>
<P>Had they Corresponded with the Bank of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and obtained of the said Bank to Circulate their Bills, either by their own Credit or Cash, had they Established any running Cash in <HI>Scotland</HI> for the Circulation, where they should have been Received and Issued on Occasion, they had come off better—; Or had the Bills had running Interest upon them, that those People who laid them up, might have had an Increase upon them as they lay by, there had been some Reason to expect they might have past.</P>
<P>But the Bank had Ingrossed the Interest paid on the Bills by the Government, and then sent them Naked into the World, to Run purely on the Credit of their Fund, without any Interest running upon them. This, and considering <HI>Scotland,</HI> a Place not yet of a great in land Commerce, in which alone such Bills are capable of being made Current, made it very improbable, that their Bills should pass in <HI>Scotland;</HI> This Mistake the Commissioners them∣selves saw, as soon as they came to <HI>Scotland</HI>—; And therefore immediately sent away to <HI>England</HI> for 50000 <HI>lib. sterling</HI> more in Gold—; Nor had this been able to have carried them thorow the Payment, had not the Commissioners, very prudently taken all the Exchequer Bills that any One brought them, and given Bills of Exchange for them payable in <HI>London</HI>—.</P>
<P>When the Commissioners found how it was—, they saw no Remedy, but to Declare, That tho' they had brought Exchequer Bills down, in order to supply the deficiency of Bullion, which was then scarce enough in <HI>England,</HI> yet that no body should be obliged to take them without their Consent, nor should any body be re∣fused payment as they came in their Order; And as a certain Great Person began with them, as some thought, by way of Experiment, and having a Demand for 4 or 5000 <HI>lib.</HI> upon the <HI>African</HI> Stock, re∣fused to take any of the said Bills, the Commissioners immediately Ordered it all to be paid in <HI>Specie.</HI></P>
<P>This, and a constant Currency of Payment, began to raise them some Reputation, and some who were Friends to the Government, and saw the Exigence of the present case, accepted of Exchequer Bills for large Sums: Others would take half Money, half Bills—;
<PB N="25" REF="586"/>
And others that came for their Money before their Turn came, yet had it offered them if they would take Bills, still preserving this Point Sacred, that no body was refused his payment in course, in Money, if he insisted on it; Thus, with a great deal of Difficulty, at last they work'd thorow the payment of the <HI>African</HI> Stock—; The Bills went all away to <HI>England</HI> so directly, that in six Months time there was not one to be seen.</P>
<P>So the Main End of the Bank, <HI>viz.</HI> The Circulation of these Bills in Trade, as a paper Credit, was quite Lost, which, had the In∣terest been runing upon them, would have been easie, and readily complyed with.</P>
<P>However, it was at last contrary to Expectation, concluded, and the whole <HI>African</HI> Stock being paid off, that Company Dissol∣ved and Died.</P>
<P>The next Affair was the Settlement of Justice in <HI>Scotland</HI>—; And this suffering some Alteration, it is needful to give a true Account of it according to my Title.</P>
<P>It had been stipulated by the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Articles, <HI>That all other Laws, in use within the Kingdom of</HI> Scotland, <HI>do after the Ʋnion, and notwithstanding thereof, remain in the same Force as before (except such as are contrary to, or inconsistent with the Terms of this Treaty) but alterable by the Parliament of</HI> Great-Britain, <HI>with this Difference betwixt the Laws concerning Publick Right, Policy, and Civil Government, and those which concern private Right; That the Laws which concern publick Right, Policy, and Civil Government, may be made the same throughout the whole Ʋnited Kingdom; But that no Alteration be made in Laws which concern private Right, except for evident Ʋtility of the Subjects within</HI> Scotland.</P>
<P><HI>That the Court of Session, or Colledge of Justice, do after the Ʋnion, and notwithstanding thereof, remain in all time coming within</HI> Scotland, <HI>as it is now Constituted by the Laws of that Kingdom, and with the same Authority and Privileges as before the Ʋnion, subject nevertheless to such Regulations for the better Administration of Justice, as shall be made by the Parliament of</HI> Great-Britain; <HI>And that the Court of Ju∣sticiary do also after the Ʋnion, and notwithstanding thereof, remain in all time coming within</HI> Scotland, <HI>as it is now Constituted by the Laws of that Kingdom, and with the same Authority and Privileges as be∣fore the Ʋnion, subject nevertheless to such Regulations as shall be made by the Parliament of</HI> Great-Britain, <HI>and without prejudice of other Rights of Justiciary.</HI></P>
<P>These Clauses preserved the ordinary Process of Law in Case of private Right, in the same Course and Condition as before; but all Pleas of the Crown, Matters of Dispute between the Queen and the Subject, <HI>relating to the Revenue,</HI> and Trade, being to be the same as in <HI>England;</HI> For that Reason; there were necessary Alterati∣ons to be made in the Methods, and even new Models of Proceed∣ings to be Formed, special to <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="587"/>
And First of the Civil Peace.</P>
<P>The several Branches of the Revenue, depending much upon the Execution of petty Justice, and particularly the Excise, in which the Justices of Peace are in most Cases, the Judges between the Brewer and the Collector; In this case, it was Necessary to Renew the Model formerly used, and taken from <HI>England, viz.</HI> Of Justices, Constables, Headboroughs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And this not only for the Deciding Diffe∣rences in the Duties, but in Forcible Entries, Executing Warrants, Apprehending Offenders, and the like; In which Cases Constables and other Officers are necessary, both to preserve the Peace, to Assist in searching Houses, and in Executing the respective Warrants of the said Justices of the Peace.</P>
<P>This, I say, made it absolutely Necessary, to Establish the same Method of Civil Justice in <HI>Scotland,</HI> as in <HI>England, viz.</HI> by Justices of the Peace, Constables, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Which at that Time was not in use in the whole Countrey.</P>
<P>It had indeed been formerly attempted in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and there were some Acts of Parliament then in Force, for the making Justices of the Peace in <HI>Scotland,</HI> as in <HI>England,</HI> particularly the 12<HI>th. Act</HI> of the first <HI>Parl. Carol.</HI> 2. <HI>anno</HI> 1661, and again by the 38<HI>th. Act</HI> of the same Parliament—; And these Acts are Recited again in the Proclamation for Erecting new Justices at this Time, which Proclamation leaving out the Names of the Persons as Ʋseless and Tedious, I have annexed in the <HI>Appendix</HI> N<SUP>o</SUP> F (3).</P>
<P>Upon the <HI>Revolution,</HI> this Method of Governing by Justices, however useful in its kind, yet as having been Negligently or Ar∣bitrarily made use of in the former Times, was laid aside, and the Government of <HI>Scotland</HI> lay as it had usually done, too much in the absolute Disposition of the Heretable Magistrates, such as Sheriffs of Counties, Steuarts of Stewartries, and such Right as the Superiori∣ties and Usages of Places gave to the Lairds; A Constitution not at all Calculated for the Liberty of <HI>Scotland,</HI> or the increase of the Happiness of the People.</P>
<P>Upon the Settling the Customs and Excise, as above, it be∣came, I say, necessary to restore the former Model of petty Justice, as <HI>per</HI> the Proclamation before Named, was done at this Time, and accordingly Justices of the Peace and Constables were Erected all over <HI>Scotland</HI>—; But this received another Interruption as a Consequence of the Union, which put a stop to all the Civil Administration for a Time, as follows.</P>
<P>By the Nineteenth Article of the Union, the Affair of the Privy Council in <HI>Scotland</HI> was left thus.<Q>And that after the Ʋnion, the Queens Majesty and Her Royal Successors, may continue a Privy Council in <HI>Scotland,</HI> for preserving of publick Peace and Order, until the Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> shall think fit to alter it, or Establish any other effectual Method for that end.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="588"/>
As soon as the Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> met, and began to Enquire into the Matter, they found the very Nature of a Privy Council in <HI>Scotland,</HI> but especially the Manner, <HI>of their Privy Coun∣cils,</HI> so inconsistent with the Treaty of Union, and above all, with the Liberty of the Subject, that they effectually Dissolved it, and Voted, that there should be but one Privy Council in <HI>Britain.</HI></P>
<P>I know this Act was opposed by several sorts of People—, and Complaint was made after its Dissolution, That <HI>Scotland</HI> was left without any Form of Government; some others Complained from another principle, of which I need say nothing here.</P>
<P>The Ministers of State also opposed it a little, but no further, than as they thought Things were not Ripe in <HI>Scotland,</HI> for so sud∣den a Dissolution of the Face of Power among them, and therefore would have had it continued for some certain limited Time only, and that with such Limitations of Authority, as might be Regulated by Parliament—; But it was thought both Burdensome and Dangerous, and indeed the Council in <HI>Scotland</HI> Acting Arbitrarily, had given the Lovers of Liberty such an Aversion to them, that they could not hear of it; And so after some Struggle, the Coun∣cil was Dissolved by Act of Parliament.</P>
<P>This is mentioned here, because of the Interruption given by the Accident of this Dissolution, to the Course of petty Justice, as aforesaid; for now all the Commissions of the Peace Ceased, being Granted by the said Privy Council, and by the new Establishment of the Council which was now to be called <HI>The Council of Great-Britain,</HI> and which was to have the same Powers, and no other, which the Council of <HI>England</HI> had before; The Commissions of the Peace could no more be Given by the Council, but by the Lord Chan∣cellor; The Commissions therefore Terminated, and the new Method of Administration met with an Interruption of several Months, but was Restored again by a general Commission of the Peace, under the Great Seal of <HI>Britain,</HI> Nominating Justices of the Peace thro' all <HI>Scotland,</HI> conform to the Method of <HI>England;</HI> This Com∣mission bears Date the 13 Day of <HI>May Anno</HI> 1708. And on this Foot the whole Island now stands in one Form of Administration, as to petty Justice, and therefore this Act is called, <HI>An Act for rendring the Ʋnion more compleat;</HI> Which Act for the more parti∣cular understanding this Affair, I have added in the <HI>Appendix,</HI> N<SUP>o.</SUP> (H. 3.) But here it is to be observed, That tho' this Act gives Power to all the Justices of the Peace in <HI>Scotland,</HI> to <HI>Do, Ʋse, and Exercise over all Persons within their several Bounds, whatever doth appertain to the Office, and Trust of a Justice of Peace, by virtue of the Laws in</HI> England <HI>before the Ʋnion, in Relation to or for the Preserva∣tion of the Publick Peace;</HI> Yet it is provided, That <HI>in all the Sessions of the Peace, they are prescribed to the Methods of Tryal and Judgment, according to the Laws of</HI> Scotland.</P>
<P>This I Note here, because some would have suggested, That this Erecting of Courts of petty Justice, <HI>For such the several Sessions of the Justices properly are</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> &amp; Giving them Authorities from the Laws
<PB N="28" REF="589"/>
and Usage of <HI>England,</HI> was an Invasion of the Nineteenth Article of the Union—, but it was clear otherwise, for tho' in the Pub∣lick Peace their Methods were the same as in <HI>England,</HI> yet it is ob∣servable;<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That very Clause was Enacted in <HI>Scotland,</HI> in the several Acts of Parliament of 1661, recited in the Commission, and never Rescinded in <HI>Scotland;</HI> And by the Union those Acts are of course Confirmed, not being any way inconsistent with or contradicting the Treaty.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Had it not been so, the Thing it self had been no way Injurious to the Treaty of Union, the Methods of Tryal, Judge∣ment, and Execution, being as above, prescribed by the Laws of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and to continue in the same Form as before.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>And this will more particularly appear, in Reading the very Na∣ture and Form of the Commissions of the Peace Granted by the Queen, to the respective Counties or Shires in <HI>Scotland,</HI> One of which, <HI>viz.</HI> for the Shire of <HI>Edinburgh;</HI> For the more especial un∣derstanding this Matter, I have annexed in the <HI>Appendix,</HI> part II. <HI>Numb.</HI> (G. 3.)</P>
<P>I might have entred here upon the Differences of Proceedings in the several new Established Courts of Justice, as of the Exche∣quer, and Admiralty, and the General and petty Sessions of the Justices—; But these Things seem not the proper Subject of a History, so I wave them here; The latter part also being very well performed to my hand, I mean, relating to the Proceedings and Office of a Justice of the Peace in <HI>Scotland,</HI> by the Ingenious Hand of Mr. <HI>William Forbes</HI> Advocate in <HI>Scotland;</HI> To which I refer the Reader.</P>
<P>There was an Alteration in Matters of Justiciary, as it is called in <HI>Scotland</HI>—; That is, of Criminal Process; For whereas this was wholly left to a certain Court, consisting of Five Judges, who were therefore called, <HI>The Lords of the Justiciary,</HI> and that their Court was holden only at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> it was considered, that this was too great an Interruption of Justice, and often times oc∣casioned the neglect of Prosecution, as well as made that Prosecu∣tion both Difficult and Chargeable to the Subject, by which means Thefts, Violences, and sometimes Murders escaped due Punishment, the Parliament Determined by the same Act of Parliament, as be∣fore, That the Lords of the Justiciary should divide the Kingdom into Circuits, and that these Circuits should be Twice a Year—, that thus Justice might, as in <HI>England,</HI> be carried Home to every Mans Door, and all the Former Inconveniencies might be for the future avoided.</P>
<P>The Manner, Methods, and other Circumstances, such as Time, Place, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Since they were nothing at all Altered, the Act of Par∣liament referring wholly to a former Law, made in the 3<HI>d.</HI> Session of the 2<HI>d.</HI> Parliament of King <HI>Charles</HI> II. came not under the Head
<PB N="29" REF="590"/>
of Alterations which I am now upon, and consequently need not be inserted.</P>
<P>I might bring the Alterations of Elections of Members for Par∣liament into this Head, as well of the Lords as Commons; But it requires nothing, but to repeat the very Articles of the Union again; And I think it is so expresly set down there, that it needs no Comment at all, being nothing but meer Matter of Form; But as there required some Addition to the Manner of the Returning of Writs, and of the Managing Elections, you will find them in the same Act of Parliament last quoted, and printed in the <HI>Appendix</HI> as above—, all that Matter being fully determined in this Act—.</P>
<P>The Matter of the Exchequer Court now erected, needs no other Description than this, That it is erected in the same Form, and proceeds by the same Method as in <HI>England,</HI> having Barons, a Re∣membrancer, Treasurer, and all the respective Clerks and Offices as in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The First Barons were as follows,<LIST>
<ITEM>The Earl of <HI>Seafield</HI> formerly Lord Chancellor of <HI>Scotland</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>Lord Chief Baron,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Mr. Baron <HI>Clark,</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>Mr. Baron <HI>Maitland,</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>Mr. Baron <HI>Smith,</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>Mr. Baron <HI>Scroop.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The Admiralty Court in <HI>Scotland</HI> remained, and the Earl of <HI>Weemyss,</HI> who was before Lord Admiral in <HI>Scotland,</HI> was now made Vice-Admiral, by Commission under the Prince of <HI>Denmark</HI> Lord High Admiral of <HI>Britain,</HI> and was, at the same time, nominated a Member of the Princes Council in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The Inferior Courts of Judicature in the Admiralty remained as before, suffering no Alteration in Form, save that what related to the Publick Revenue, or the Claims of the Sovereign, began to be modelled as in <HI>England,</HI> agreeable to the 18th. and 19th. Articles of the Union.</P>
<P>Thus the Law in <HI>Scotland</HI> remained intire, the Process in Com∣mon Causes being the same, and the Alterations being consined, as <HI>per</HI> the Treaty, to the Established Methods of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>I come now to the Coyn; And tho' this has been a Thing of great Consequence, yet it requires little more to be said to it, than just that it suffered a general Revolution; And that all the former Coyns of <HI>Scotland,</HI> as well as the Foreign <HI>Species</HI> of Money which went current in <HI>Scotland,</HI> the <HI>English</HI> Money excepted, was Called in and Recoyned, the <HI>English</HI> Money being only to pass current.</P>
<P>But there was a Difficulty which I have noted in the Minutes gave them some Trouble, <HI>viz:</HI> That the <HI>English</HI> Money, which went for one Penny in every Shilling Advance, should be reduced to a <HI>Par,</HI> that the Loss should be made good by the Government, and yet the <HI>English</HI> not bring in great Quantities to <HI>Scotland,</HI> to be offered to the Mint at one Penny <HI>per</HI> Shilling, and immediately re∣ceived again with an Allowance of the Difference: To prevent
<PB N="30" REF="591"/>
this, that Contrivance was found out, to bring in all the <HI>English</HI> Money at one certain Day, and receive it out again with an Allow∣ance for the Difference—; This occasioned the Proclamation for the Alteration, that all the Money should be paid in on a short Day, and immediately returned with Notes for the Difference; This Proclamation, as it expresses the whole Scheme, I have added in the <HI>Appendix, N<SUP>o</SUP>. I;</HI> Which, tho' it be a long Proclamation, yet, as it may be a Precedent in like Cases, I have set down for general Information.</P>
<P>The several Proclamations for the gradual Calling in the Old Money, are too many to note here; It may suffice to hint, That, as the Foreign Money being brought in, which amounted to above 150000 Pounds <HI>Sterling;</HI> And this going into the Mint, the New Coyn began to Circulate very speedily; And, at the Writing these Sheets, the whole Nation was full of New Money.</P>

<P>There were several <HI>Species</HI> of <HI>Scots</HI> Money that had been current, and of which several Remainders were to be found—; But the Quantities were so small, that I do not place them among the current Coyn.</P>
<P>It is enough to say, that all sorts were called in by the Treaty, and no Money made current by the Government, but the <HI>English</HI> or <HI>British</HI> Coyn.</P>
<P>I need not Record the Days and Times, when and how long every particular <HI>Species</HI> were permitted to pass; 'Tis enough to say, the Prudence of the Government so ordered it, that the People felt no Miss, or Want of the current Money; And the Thing was done so gradually, that the New Money was Circulating, before the Old was Called in.</P>
<P>This was done thus—; First the <HI>English</HI> Money was reduced, as has been observed, by Proclamation—; Then the Foreign Money was brought in; And this being a much greater Quantity than was expected, the Mint immediately fell to Work with it—; And this, joyned to the Money brought down for the Equi∣valent, furnish'd above 200000 <HI>l.</HI> in Silver Money, besides what <HI>English</HI> Money was in the Countrey before; So that the New Mo∣ney was dispers'd in every Corner of the Nation insensibly, and the Old went off gradually, without any Interruption to Business—; And at the Writing these Sheets, the last, <HI>viz.</HI> The <HI>Scots</HI> Milled Money was yet passing, but appointed to come into the Mint by a certain Day; There were several Proclamations for this, and several Days appointed; I have added only one in the <HI>Appen∣dix,</HI> to let the Reader into the Method settled for this purpose, which terminated the Currency of the <HI>Scots</HI> Money to the 25<HI>th.</HI> of <HI>February</HI> 1707/8; But even that Time was lengthened afterwards, and the <HI>Scots</HI> Money suffered to pass again till the latter end of <HI>September</HI> 1708—; And thus by Degrees the <HI>English</HI> Coyn pre∣vailed,
<PB N="32" REF="593"/>
and is now the only current Coyn of the Nation. This Proclamation is marked in the <HI>Appendix, N<SUP>o</SUP>. K</HI> 3.</P>
<P>I cannot say so much for the New Regulations of Weights and Measures, in which, tho' appointed by the Union to be made the same, little Progress could be made at the Writing of these Ac∣counts, save that the Publick Business of the Custom-House was all settled by the Weights and Measures of <HI>England;</HI> But Custom had so inured the People to the former Weights and Measures, especial∣ly the Weights for their Retailing Goods, and the Measures for Corn, that it was impossible to bring the Change about so soon; Time alone can bring it to the Issue designed.</P>
<P>Nor is the reducing the Measures to an Uniform Standart so ab∣solutely necessary, as that we should think the Union Defective for want of it; Since the Measures, <HI>especially that which we call Dry Mea∣sure, as of Corn and Fruit,</HI> is at this time various almost all over <HI>England</HI>—; As particularly in the North, the <HI>Boll</HI> remains a received Measure in <HI>Northumberland</HI> and <HI>Cumberland,</HI> in the West, as in <HI>Cornwal</HI> and <HI>Devonshire,</HI> the Bushel is almost two Bushels of the common Measure—; Even the <HI>Winchester</HI> Bushel, which is the Standart of Measure in <HI>England,</HI> varies, and in some places it contains eight Gallons, in others nine Gallons, in some places they have one to the Score thrown into the Measure, in other places not—; Again, in Liquid Measure we have the Quart of two kinds for several Liquors, as the Wine Quart and the <HI>Winchester</HI> Quart, we have the Pottle and Gallon for dry Measure, the Pint and thence up to the Gallon of Liquid Measure; in Coals we have what is called the Chalder at <HI>Newcastle,</HI> and the Chalder at <HI>London,</HI> and the differ∣ing Chalder in several differing parts—; At <HI>London</HI> the Chalder is 36 Bushels, at <HI>Sandwich</HI> 32, at <HI>Lym</HI> 40, at <HI>Newcastle</HI> 70 Bushels; So, tho' the Measures of Corn and Liquors should have their Varia∣tions in <HI>Scotland,</HI> according to the old Customs and Usage of Towns, Counties, and Manners, yet this does not at all render the Union incompleat; Since the reducing the Weights and Measures to an equal Standart in the Publick Accounts, such as in the Customs, Tolls, Excises, Publick Receipts and Payments, <HI>and the like,</HI> is as effectual an Equality as is needful; And indeed is as much as was intended by the Union, no Act of Parliament, Law, or Statute that can be made, being able to oblige the Countrey People in eve∣ry place to leave off their wonted Calculations and Denominations of Things, which are frequently made upon the Foot of their An∣cient Customs; <HI>For Example, as before,</HI> the Valuation of Lands, Tenor of Leases, the Rents, the Entails, Rent-Charges, Liferents, and Payments for, or out of Land Revenue, are all reckoned in <HI>Scotland</HI> by the <HI>Chalder, Boll, Firlot,</HI> and <HI>Lippy,</HI> and cannot be altered; Even Marriage Settlements and Entails are entered in this manner; And it would run <HI>Scotland</HI> into all manner of Con∣fusion, to oblige them at once to leave off all the Terms, by which their Lands are known Valued, Mortgaged, Entailed, Charged or Conveyed.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="594"/>
I think we have thus gently touch'd at all the Alterations of Moment which were made in the Laws, Trade, Custom and Con∣stitution of <HI>Scotland,</HI> according to my Title; But lest it may be thought, That these Alterations ly too much dispersed up and down this Book, in the Relation of particular Cases, I shall endea∣vour to sum them up in the following Abridgement.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> As to the Constitution, tho' last named—, I conceive it suffered some Alteration, tho' not, as was alledged by some, an intire Dissolution—; It was not dissolved, because the Govern∣ment by King and Parliament continued the same, <HI>viz.</HI> A Limit∣ed Monarchy; It received no Diminution, but an Addition of Privileges and Liberties; And had the <HI>Scots</HI> thought sit to have gone a little further, and made Provision for Transferring their Su∣periorities, they might have at last come to an intire Enjoyment of that same Liberty that <HI>England</HI> is now so happy in—; How∣ever, tho' the Constitution received no Dissolution, yet it is ac∣knowledged, that it suffered Alterations in several Articles, of which these are the principal.<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That tho the Monarchy is the same, yet that they be∣come Incorporated into one Monarchy with their Neighbour Kingdom, subjected for ever to the same Sovereign, and en∣gaged in War, Peace, Alliances and Succession with them; So that they can no more act in their separate Capacity, in any Thing relating to Government or Constitution.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. They suffer Alterations in their Representative—, and these consist in Two Branches; <HI>First,</HI> That the Number of their Representative is reduced to 45. <HI>Secondly,</HI> That the Electi∣ons pass under a new Regulation, and are managed by a dif∣ferent Method. And, <HI>Thirdly,</HI> That they Sit not any more in Parliament by themselves, but in Conjunction with the <HI>English</HI> Parliament, Representing the several Counties and Corporati∣ons, as Members of the United Kingdom of <HI>Great Britain.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>3. The Hereditary Branch of Parliament, I mean the Peers, suffer also an Alteration, being changed from a full Appear∣ance in Parliament to a Representative Appearance, and that Representative Limited to the Number of Sixteen.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. Their Regal Administration suffers an Alteration; The Sovereign, who before executed the Civil Power in a separate Capacity, being now obliged to change the Face of that Ad∣ministration into an United Management, Governing now by One Parliament, One Privy Council, One High Admiral, One Chancery, One Treasury—; And, in short, One ge∣neral Oeconomy of Government—; Thus the several di∣stinct Offices of Admiral, Chancellor, Treasurer, Secretaries of State, and President of Privy Council, sunk in either King∣dom, and New Commissions were issued—; As One Pri∣vy Council, and One President, under the Title of Lord Pre∣sident of the Privy Council of <HI>Britain,</HI> Lord High Chancellor of <HI>Britain,</HI> Lord High Treasurer of <HI>Britain,</HI> Lord High Admi∣ral
<PB N="34" REF="595"/>
of <HI>Britain,</HI> and the like, and which I close all with, the Queen her self lays down her separate Titles, and is now no more Queen of <HI>England, Scotland, &amp;c.</HI> But Queen of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> and is called in Missives, and in Foreign Accounts, Her <HI>Britannick</HI> Majesty—; Her Troops are no more <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> and <HI>Scots,</HI> but <HI>British</HI> Forces—; And the Arms of the Island are a new Incorporated and Quartered together—, as appears at large in the foregoing Sheets.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>This, I think, is the Sum of the principal Alterations in the Constitution of <HI>Scotland</HI> by the Union; In all which, except that of the Parliament, the Commons being reduced in Number, and the Lords by Representative; I say, in all the rest, <HI>England</HI> suffer∣ed the same Alterations as <HI>Scotland,</HI> such as dissolving her Parlia∣ment, her Name as a Kingdom, her Council, Great Offices, and Title of her Sovereign—; And all things began <HI>de novo</HI> in both Kingdoms, under the single Denomination of <HI>Britain</HI> and <HI>British.</HI></P>
<P>The second Head of Alterations is that of the Laws; And this is so particularly entered into in the beginning of this very Part of my Work, that I need be but very short.<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The Laws of Government continue as the Government continues establish'd in the Claim of Right, I mean as to the Limitations of Government and Obedience; Nor has <HI>Scotland</HI> suffered any Loss, but rather been a manifest Gainer in this Point by the Union; The Privy Council Tyranny being a∣bolish'd, who had arrived to that Height in <HI>Scotland,</HI> as to give their Acts almost of an equal Authority to Acts of Parlia∣ment—; A Power wholly disclaimed by the Privy Coun∣cil in <HI>England,</HI> to whose Powers and Authorities the present Council of <HI>Britain</HI> is by Parliament expresly Limited and Confined.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The Laws of Private Right have suffered no Alteration, other than as Private Right may be intermix'd with that of the Crown—; But all the Laws of Publick Right, such as relate to Customs and Excises, have suffered the Alterations mentioned in the Union, a Court of Exchequer being esta∣blish'd in <HI>Scotland</HI> for that purpose; And this was necessary, as has been noted, because of the Alterations necessary in the Revenue, and in the respective Methods of Ascertaining and Collecting the Customs, Excises, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> due to the Crown; And in this Clause may be included the several Laws for Pe∣nalties, Fines, Forfeitures, and Confiscations, upon the par∣ticular Trespasses of the Laws relating to Customs and Excise, which were wholly new—.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. The Governing Laws relating to the Civil Peace have suffered some Alteration, as to what was just before the Uni∣on by the Erecting Justices of the Peace; But this seems a Re∣storing what was before, rather than an Alteration of what was, since it was nothing but what was actually put in Practice
<PB N="35" REF="596"/>
twice before, and what there were Laws then in Being to ju∣stify their Return. So all the Alterations that seem to be made now, were, <HI>First,</HI> Only that the Justices of Peace formerly had their Commission from the Privy Council in <HI>Scotland,</HI> but now received it from the Lord Chancellor of <HI>Britain</HI>—; And, <HI>Se∣condly,</HI> That the Justices of Peace had some new Powers vested in them since the Union, which they had not before, such as determining Disputes in the Duty of Excise, giving Power of Distress for Payment, Warrants of Forcible Entries, in case of Concealments of Customs, and the like.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>All the rest of the Laws of <HI>Scotland</HI> remained the same <HI>per</HI> the Union; The Circuits of the Lords of the Justiciary I take also to be no Innovation at all, as what had formerly been practised.</P>
<P>I come now to Alterations of Trade; And these can receive but a very short Description here, because the greatest Alte∣rations which happened in Trade, could not follow the Union so closs at the Heels, as the Time of the Writing these Sheets require to relate it; But such as were immediately the Consequence of the Union, were such as these,<LIST>
<ITEM>1. A general Prohibition and Stop of Commerce with <HI>France,</HI> which, till now, <HI>Scotland</HI> publickly carryed on.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. A Prohibition of all Exports and Imports as in <HI>England;</HI> And by virtue of that Clause, a particular Prohibition of the Exportation of Wool, which was, till then, publickly allow∣ed in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and which, tho' People seemed at first very uneasy at, yet was, without Doubt, very much for the Pub∣lick Advantage of <HI>Scotland,</HI> whose Manufactures were thereby quite sunk as to Exportation—; This Article was attended with Penalties and Forfeitures particular, and such as were not practised in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and for which the Laws of Excise and Customs in <HI>England</HI> were introduced, and the Trials on which were brought on, either before the Justices of Peace, or Court of Exchequer, as above.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Whereas <HI>Scotland</HI> had, before this, prohibited all the <HI>English</HI> Woollen Manufactures, under severe Penalties, and <HI>England,</HI> on the other Hand, had excluded the <HI>Scots</HI> from Trading with <HI>Scots</HI> Ships to their Colonies in <HI>America,</HI> directly from <HI>Scotland,</HI> and had Confiscated even their own <HI>English</HI> Ships Trading to the said Colonies from <HI>England,</HI> if Navigat∣ed or Manned with above one Third <HI>Scots</HI> Seamen, had laid Tolls and heavy Imposts upon Cattel and Linen Imported into <HI>England</HI> from <HI>Scotland,</HI> and had prohibited the Exportation of Corn from <HI>England</HI> to <HI>Scotland,</HI> tho' the Occasion of it might be never so great, but on the same Conditions, and under the same Restrictions as to other Countries; Now, by the Uni∣on, all these Prohibitions, Restraints, Tolls, Imposts, and Exclusions on either Hand, were taken off; The <HI>English</HI> Growth and Manufactures, formerly prohibited, came immediately, free of all Interruptions into <HI>Scotland;</HI> All the Tolls and Im∣posts
<PB N="36" REF="597"/>
upon <HI>Scots</HI> Cattel, Linen, or other Goods in <HI>England,</HI> were taken off; All the Ports of <HI>England,</HI> whether in <HI>Europe</HI> or <HI>America,</HI> were open to <HI>Scots</HI> Ships, without any Imposts or Restraint; <HI>Scots</HI> Sailers in <HI>English</HI> Bottoms were immediately free, and Ships from the <HI>English</HI> Colonies might Sail to, and Unlade free in <HI>Scotland,</HI> without any Obstruction.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>These I call Alterations in the Laws of Trade; Besides which, there were some particular Alterations which relate to the Draw∣backs, Bounties, and Allowances on the Exportation, and for Encouragement of the Exportation of Fish, Corn, Pork, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Of which I need say nothing, having been very particular already in the Relation of the Debates upon those Heads in Parliament.</P>
<P>The Consequences of these Things upon Trade are at present few, but will necessarily be far greater hereafter—; The first visible Consequence was the Rise and Fall of several kinds of Mer∣chandizes, as the new Alterations, Prohibitions, or Importations of them happened, differing from what they were before.</P>
<P>As for Example, Wines, Brandy, and all kinds of Goods of the Growth of <HI>France,</HI> must of Course rise in their Value, the further Import being prohibited; And this would have enrich'd a great many Families in <HI>Scotland,</HI> who had Quantities of these Goods on their Hands, had not the Difficulty of Enforcing these Prohibitions at first laid Trade open to Clandestine Importations, by which the Fair Trader was, as in such Cases always happens, a very great Sufferer.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> All the Goods of the Growth of the <HI>English</HI> Colonies, or which were to be had from <HI>England,</HI> being now Imported directly to <HI>Scotland,</HI> began to come as the Return of the <HI>Scots</HI> Manufactures—; Several Ships being laden from <HI>Scotland</HI> to <HI>Virginia</HI> and <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> the very first Year after the Union.</P>
<P>Another Consequence of this Union in Trade, was the letting fall almost all the Woollen Manufactures, which had been erected in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and where they began to come to some Perfection in making Broad Cloth, Druggets, and Stuffs of all sorts; But, upon the Opening the <HI>English</HI> Trade, they were immediately so Throng'd with <HI>English</HI> Goods of the same sorts so much cheaper, that it ap∣peared those Things would die of Course.</P>
<P>Tho' indeed this seemed to be some Blow to their Trade, and particularly to the Imployment of their Poor, yet, at the same time, the Duties upon Linen from <HI>Scotland</HI> being taken off in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> made so great a Demand for <HI>Scots</HI> Linen more than usual, that it seemed the Poor could want no Imployment; And several kinds of Linen being set to Work by <HI>English</HI> Men, which never be∣fore were made, or at least for Exportation in <HI>Scotland,</HI> such as Sail-Cloths, Canvas, Damask, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> It is thought, the Imployment of the Poor was not lessened by this Alteration.</P>
<P>On the other Hand, the Lower and Courser Manufactures in <HI>Scot∣land,</HI> which were made of their own Wool, seemed to increase, and not only found a larger Vent in <HI>Scotland,</HI> but were bought up
<PB N="37" REF="598"/>
by the <HI>English</HI> Merchants, who brought other Stuffs thither, and sold in <HI>England;</HI> And these Manufactures are not unlikely to rise to a considerable Height, such as <HI>Stirling</HI> Serges, in <HI>England</HI> called <HI>Shaloons, Musselburgh</HI> Stuffs, and the like; And we find in <HI>England</HI> some Proposals from the <HI>African</HI> Company, for the making <HI>Guinea</HI> Stuffs there, which perhaps may in time come to be very conside∣rable.</P>
<P>I might enter here into the Schemes and Projects, which have made much Noise in the World for Improvement of Fishing in <HI>Scot∣land,</HI> and of Navigation and building Ships in <HI>Scotland;</HI> But as these things have yet made no Alterations in the Trade, and are but in <HI>Embrio</HI> at the Writing these Sheets, I cannot mingle them here as Matter of History, but have touch'd them more at large in the Preface.</P>
<P>It remains only to speak of the Alterations of the Customs—; And this would have required a long Table of the several Duties and Impost formerly paid in <HI>Scotland</HI> upon the Export and Import of Merchandizes—; But having already given an Account, That the whole Customs are settled upon the <HI>English</HI> Foot; And the Duties of all Kinds being too large to insert here, and already Print∣ed in the Book of Rates, Re-printed in <HI>Scotland,</HI> it would be a Vain Labour to recite the Particulars: And as to the Difference between the Duties on the <HI>English</HI> Foot, and the Duties as paid be∣fore, it required the very same Recital of Particulars, the Length of which would be intolerable; And for this Reason, tho' I have re∣ferred to some Schemes said to be in the second part of this <HI>Appen∣dix,</HI> and which I received from the Custom-House in <HI>Scotland,</HI> yet when I came to find upon Examination, that the Tacksmen of the Customs in <HI>Scotland</HI> usually compounded with the Merchants, and reduced the said Customs to what Sum they pleased, I chose to omit a Scheme, which, when put down, would give the Reader no certain Guess at the Thing, and consequently signify no∣thing.</P>
<P>If any Man should enquire, Whether, upon the whole of these Alterations in Trade, <HI>Scotland</HI> is Gainer or Loser, I must ac∣knowledge, it is a difficult Point to resolve at so small a Di∣stance from the Finishing the Union; But, as to the Profit of the Trade between <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>England</HI> in particular, as it ap∣pears at the Writing these Sheets, I shall leave the Impartial Ob∣server to guess by these Two Particulars.<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That about Seventeen Ships from the several Ports of <HI>Scotland</HI> are already fitted out, and sent away to the <HI>English</HI> Colonies, whose Loading is certainly the Product of the Ground, or Labour of the Poor, and whose Return must be in Sugar, Tobacco, Cotton, Indico, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and Money—.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That above 170000 Bolls of Corn of sundry sorts has already been Shipped off from <HI>Scotland</HI> for <HI>England,</HI> besides a very great Quantity bought up by <HI>England,</HI> and Shipp'd di∣rectly for <HI>Portugal;</HI> Both these Articles are Additions to the
<PB N="38" REF="599"/>
Trade of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and both within little more than a Year immediately succeeding the Union of the Island: What fur∣ther Encrease of Commerce may accrue to <HI>Scotland,</HI> when these Bloody Wars shall end, and when Peace shall be restor∣ed to <HI>Europe,</HI> I shall not pretend to Examine; But there seems to be no Question, but the Trade of <HI>Scotland</HI> stands fair for very great Improvements.</ITEM>

<P>THE Commission of the General Assembly of this National Church, having under their most serious Consideration; That the great and weighty Affair of a Treaty of Union, be∣tween the two Nations, is now laid before the Parliament; And how much the Result of their Determinations, with Respect to the same, may prove of the highest Consequence; both to this Church and Nation in all their Interests Civil and Religious; And that both to the present, and succeeding Generations; Considering likewise, that the abounding and continued Encrease of Impiety, Popery and Prophanness through the Land, the abuse of the Privileges and Mer∣cies, we have enjoyed, and hitherto, through the Infinite Goodness, and Long-suffering Patience of GOD do still enjoy, our Ʋnthank∣fulness for, and Ʋnfruitfulness, under the Gospel; Our Formality, Decay of Zeal and slackness in Promoving according to our Stations, the much called for Work, of Sincere Personal and National Refor∣mation; May justly provoke the Righteous and Holy GOD, to re∣move our Blessings, to smite us in his hot Displeasure; and for our Sins to leave our Rulers in this vastly important, and difficult Exigence wherein there is so much need of clear and unprejudicated Light, and of Harmony, and Oneness in the LORD: They have therefore judg∣ed it incumbent upon them to excite themselves, and all the People of GOD in the Land to much Seriousness, Diligence, and continued Fervour in applying to the Throne of Grace, upon so great and mo∣mentuous Affairs: And they do hereby most seriously and earnestly Recommend to all the Presbytries within this National Church; To appoint, set a part, and observe a Day, for solemn publick Prayer, Fasting and Humiliation, in all the Curches within their Respective Bounds, as soon as possible; For which End the Moderators of the several Presbytries are to call them <HI>pro re nata,</HI> as soon as this comes to their Hand; And farder, that Presbytries continue to keep among themselves, and Ministers with their Sessions, Dyets, for persisting instant in prayer to GOD, and for preserving upon their own Spirits, and of all the Lords People, a due Concern about their proper duty with Respect unto the Church of CHRIST, and the great Affairs now in Agitarion.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="602"/>
And the Commission doth most earnestly beseech and obtest in the Bowels of our Lord Jesus Christ, all their Brethren of the Ministry, and all the Lords People, that they stir up themselves and one ano∣ther to humble sincere and penitent Confessions of their own Sins, and the Sins of the Land, and to unfeigned Resolutiosn to Amend∣ment, with active and zealous Endeavours after thorow Reformation respectively in their Places; Together also with ardent Supplications to the Father of Mercies in Behalf of the whole Church of Christ over the World; And particularly of the Church in this Land, that he may be pleased to take away all Iniquity, to turn our Hearts unto him, to return unto us and abide with us in Mercy, and graciously to pre∣serve, establish and perfect what he has wrought for us: That our most Gracious Queen may be blessed and preserved in her Person, and guided of God in her Government and Councils, and that there may be a due thankful Acknowledgement of the great and wonderful Things God hath done, in giving such Success to the Forces of Her Majesty and these of her Allies, against the great Troubler of the Peace of Europe, and Persecutor of the Church and People of God, and that God may continue his Kindness in prospering Her Majestie's, and these of Her Allie's Forces both by Sea and Land against the com∣mon Enemy; And that all the Consultations and Determinations of the Estates of Parliament, especially with Respect to an Ʋnion with <HI>England</HI> may be influenced and directed by divine Wisdom and Conduct in the Fear of the Lord, to his Glory, the good of Religion, and this National Church established by Law in Doctrine, Worship, Discipline and Government, and the Well-fare, Comfort and Satisfacti∣on of the People of this Nation, and the Peace and Prosperity of both Kingdoms, that Iniquity may stop its Mouth, that all sinful Conten∣tion and Discord may cease; And that Truth, Righteousness, and Peace may flourish and be perpetuated in this Church and Land: And its ordained that thir Presents be read in the Paroch Churches.

It is Statute that there be no Commo∣tion, nor rising of Commons in Burrows, in hindering of the Common Law; And that if any does in the contrary, and Knowledge or Tent may be gotten thereof; Their Goods be Confiscate to the King, and their Lives be at the King's Will: As also, by the <HI>Act</HI> of <HI>Parliament Ja.</HI> 6<HI>th, Par.</HI> 18. <HI>Cap.</HI> 11. It is Statute, That no Person within Burgh take upon Hand, under whatsomever pretext, to convocate, without the Knowledge and Licence of the Magistrates, under the Pain to be punished in their Body and Goods, with all Rigour.

even the Time of Sitting, and at the Rising of the High and Honourable Court of <HI>Parliament,</HI> where Our High Commissioner was present amongst them, Most Disorderly and Insolent Convocations, and gathering of Commons, filling the Streets with Clamour and Confusion, and Insulting not only peaceable Persons; But also some of the Members of Our said High and Honourable Court of <HI>Parliament,</HI> presuming to Threaten and Invade them in their very Dwelling-Houses, by a most villanous and outragious Mobb, which all Per∣sons of Justice, Reason and Honour ought to detest, and endeavour to Suppress and Prevent in the severest &amp; strictest Manner. Therefore, we in the just Resentment of such high Indignities; &amp; to prevent the like in all Time coming, have thought fit, with Advice of the Lords of Our Privy Council; To ordain the Magistrates of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> to con∣tinue their Diligence, and make strict Inquirie and Search, and to cause Apprehend all the Authors, Abetters, Accessaries, or Assistants of the foresaids Convocations, Mobbs and Tumults, to the Effect they may be brought to condign Punishment; Declaring for that End, That whosoever shall discover any of the saids Authors, or Accessaries of the saids Tumults, shall not only be himself Indemnified, But have a due steward for so good Service.

As also, that they call the Regents and Masters of the Colledge of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and enjoyn them strictly, that for hereafter they keep their Schollars in good Order, and be careful of their quiet and peaceable Behavi∣our: And We Ordain all the Inhabitants of the said Burgh, readi∣ly to Assist and Concurr with the Magistrates, for repressing and pu∣nishing all Tumults, under the foresaid Pain of Law: And farder for preventing the like wicked Insolence in Time coming; We with Advice foresaid, hereby declare, That in Case and when∣ever any such Disorderly Convocation or Tumult shal appear, or begin to appear for hereafter; and that thereupon Intimation shal be made by the Magistrates, to all and sundry, to withdraw and retire to their respective Houses, Shops and Imployments; What∣ever Apprentice, Servant, Journey-man, Foot-man, or any other Person, shall disobey and be found upon the Streets, shall be repute and held as Fosterers and Maintainers of the saids Tumults, and punished accordingly. And it is farder Ordered, that after such In∣timation made to all Persons to retire to their Houses, and clear the Streets; Whoever shall be found thereafter Disobedient, and to continue upon the Streets, may be attacked and Seized by the Town Guard within the Town of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and alse by such of our For∣ces, as upon such Occasions have been, or shall be called for, and or∣dered by our Privy Council to March in, and be assistant for the suppressing and dissiparing of such wicked Tumults and Disorders and that with all Manner of Force, and by all such means as shall be

<HEAD>To His Grace, Her Majesty's High Com∣missioner, and the Right Honourable, the Estates of Parliament, The ADDRESS of the Commissioners to the General Con∣vention of the <HI>ROYAL BURROWS</HI> of this Ancient King∣dom, Conveened <DATE>the 29th of <HI>October</HI> last,</DATE> upon the Great Concern of the <HI>Union,</HI> Proposed betwixt <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>England,</HI> for Concerting such Measures, as should be esteemed Proper for Them to take, with Relation to Their TRADE, and other Concerns.</HEAD>
<OPENER>HUMBLY SHEWETH,</OPENER>
<P>THAT as by the CLAIM OF RIGHT, it is the Privilege of all Subjects to Petition: So at this Time, being mostly Impow∣ered by Our <HI>CONSTITƲENTS;</HI> and knowing the SENTI∣MENTS of the PEOPLE We Represent: It is Our Indispensible DUTY, to Signifie to Your Grace, and the Honourable Estates of Parliament. That as We are not against an Honourable and Safe U∣nion with <HI>England,</HI> Consisting with the BEING OF THIS KING∣DOM, and PARLIAMENT thereof: Without which, We con∣ceive neither Our RELIGION, nor Our CIVIL INTERESTS and TRADE, as We now, by LAW, Enjoy them, can be Secured to Us, and Our Posterity, far less can We expect to have the Condition of the PEOPLE of SCOTLAND, with Relation to these great Con∣cerns, made Better and Improven, without a SCOTS PARLIA∣MENT.</P>
<P>AND, Seing by the Articles of Union, now under the Considerati∣on of the Honourable Estates of Parliament, It is agreed, That SCOT∣LAND and <HI>England</HI> shall be United into one Kingdom; And that the united Kingdoms be united by one and the Same Parliament. By which Our MONARCHY is Supprest, Our PARLIAMENTS Extin∣guished; and in Consequence, Our RELIGION, CHURCH-GO∣VERNMENT, CLAIM OF RIGHT, LAWS, LIBERTIES, TRADE, and all that is Dear to Us, daily in Danger of being Encroached upon, altered, or wholly Subverted by the <HI>English,</HI> in a <HI>British-Para∣liament:</HI> Wherein, the Mean Representation allowed for SCOT∣LAND, can never Signifie in Securing to us the INTEREST Reser∣ved by us, or granted to us by the <HI>English.</HI></P>
<P>And by these <HI>Articles,</HI> Our Poor PEOPLE are made liable to the <HI>English</HI> Taxes, which is a certain unsupportable Burden; Conside∣ring, That the Trade Proposed is Uncertain, Involved, and wholly
<PB N="9" REF="608"/>
Precarious: Especially: when Regulate as to Export and Import by the Laws of <HI>England,</HI> and under the same Prohibitions and Restricti∣ons, Customs, and Duties. And considering, That the most consi∣derable Branches of Our TRADE, are differing from those of <HI>England,</HI> and are, and may be yet more Discouraged by their Laws; And that all the Concerts of TRADE, and OUR INTEREST, are, after the <HI>Ʋnion,</HI> Subject to such Alterations, as the Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> shall think fit.</P>
<P><HI>We therefore Supplicate your Grace and the Honourable Estates of Parliament; and do assuredly Expect, that ye will not con∣clude such an Incorporate Ʋnion, as is contained in the Articles Proposed; But that ye will Support and Maintain the TRƲE REFORMED PROTESTANT RELIGION and CHƲRCH GOVERNMENT, as by Law Established The SOVEREIG∣NITY and INDEPENDENCY of this CROWN and KING∣DOM, and the RIGHTS and PRIVILEGES of PARLIA∣MENT, Which has been Generously asserted by you, in the {left blank} Session of this present Parliament: And do further Pray, that effectual Means may be used for Defeating the De∣signs and Attempts of all Popish Pretenders whatsomever, to the Succession of this CROWN and KINGDOM; and for Securing this NATION against all the ATTEMPTS and INCROACHMENTS that may be made by any Persons whatsomever, upon the SOVEREIGNITY, RELIGION, LAWS, LIBERTIES, TRADE and QƲIET of the same. And We promise to Maintain with Our Lives and Fortunes all these valuable Things, in Opposition to all POPISH and other Enemies whatsomever, according to our LAWS, and CLAIM OF RIGHT.</HI></P>

<HEAD>THese are to Notifie to all Concerned, what are our Reasons for, and Designs in the Burning of the <HI>Printed Articles of the Proposed Ʋnion with England,</HI> with the Names of the <HI>Scots</HI> Commissio∣ners, Subscribers thereof; together with the Minutes of the whole Treaty betwixt them and the <HI>English</HI> Commissioners thereanent.</HEAD>
<P>WE have herein no Design against Her Majesty, nor against <HI>England,</HI> or any <HI>Englishman;</HI> neither against Our present Parliament, in their Acts or Actings, for the Interest, Safety and Sovereignity of this <HI>Our Native and Ancient</HI> NATION; But to Testifie our Dissent from, Discontent with, and Protestation against
<PB N="10" REF="609"/>
the Twenty five Articles of the said Union, Subscribed by the fore∣said Commissioners, as being Inconsistent with, and altogether Pre∣judicial to, and utterly Destructive of this NATION's Independency, Grown-Rights, and Our Constitute Laws, both Sacred and Civil. We shall not here Condescend upon the particular Prejudices, that do, and will redound to this Nation, if the said Ʋnion should be car∣ried on, according to the Printed Articles: But referrs the Reader to the Variety of Addresses, given in to the present Parliament by all Ranks, from almost all Corners of this Nation, against the said Ʋnion: Only We must say and profess, That the Commissioners for this Nation, have been either Simple, Ignorant, or Treacherous if not all Three; when the Minutes of the Treaty betwixt the Com∣missioners of both Kingdoms are duely Considered; And when we compare their Dastardly Tieldings unto the Demands and Proposals of the <HI>English</HI> Commissioners; who, on the contrair, have Valiantly Acquit themselves for the Interest and Safety of their Nation.</P>
<P>We acknowledge it is in the Power of the present Parliament, to give Remissions to the Subscribers of the foresaid Articles; and we heartily wish for a good Agreement amongst all the Members of the Parliament, so as it may tend to the Safety and Preservation of both CHURCH and STATE, with all the Privileges belonging thereto, within the Kingdom of <HI>SCOTLAND.</HI></P>
<P>But if the Subscribers of the foresaid Treaty and Union, with their Associats in Parliament, shall presume to carry on the said Ʋni∣on, by a supream Power, over the Belly of the Generality of this Nation: Then, and in that Case, as we judge, that the Consent of the Generality of the same, can only Divest them of their Sacred and Civil Libertys, Purchased and Maintained by our <HI>ANCESTORS</HI> with their Blood: So we protest, whatever Ratification of the foresaid Ʋnion may pass in Parliament, contrair to our Fundamental Laws, Liberties, and Privileges, concerning Church and State, may not be binding upon the Nation, now or at any Time to come: And par∣ticularly we protest against the Approbation of the first Article of the said Ʋnion, before the Privileges of this Nation, contain'd in the other Articles had been adjusted and secured: And so we ear∣nestly Require, that the Representatives in Parliament, who are for Our Nation's Privileges, would give timeous Warning to all the Corners of the Kingdom; That we and our Posterity become not Tributary and Bond-slaves to our Neighbours, without acquiting our selves, as becomes Men and Christians: And we are Confident, that the Souldiers now in Martial Power, have so much of the Spi∣rits of <HI>Scots men;</HI> that they are not ambitions to be Disposed of, at the pleasure of another Nation: And we hereby Declare, that we have no Design against them in this Matter.</P>

<OPENER>SHEWETH,</OPENER>
<P>THat beside the general Address already made by us, for securing the Doctrine, Worship, Discipline and Government of this Church, and now under Your Consideration, which withall Gratitude we acknowledge; There are some Particulars which in Pursuance of the Design of our said Address, we do with all Humi∣lity lay before Your Grace and Lordships.
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. That the Sacramental Test being the Condition of access to Places of Trust, and to Benefites from the Crown, All of our Com∣munion must be debarred from the same, if not in <HI>Scotland,</HI> Yet through the rest of the Dominion of <HI>Britain,</HI> which may prove of most dangerous Consequence to this Church.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. That this Church and Nation may be exposed to the further Danger of new Oaths from the Parliament of <HI>Britain,</HI> unless it be provided that no Oath, Bond or Test, of any Kind, shall be requi∣red of any Minister or Member of the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> which are inconsistent with the known Principles of this Church.</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. There being no Provision in the Treaty of Ʋnion, for secu∣ring of this Church by a Coronation Oath, That therefore in the Co∣ronation Oath to be taken by the Sovereigns of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> they be engaged to Maintain the Doctrine, Worship, Discipline and Go∣vernment of this Church, and the Rights and Privileges thereof, as now by Law established.</ITEM>
<ITEM>IV. That in Case the proposed Union be Concluded, the Church will suffer Prejudice, unless there be a Commission for Plantation of
<PB N="14" REF="613"/>
Kirks and Valuation of Teinds, and making up the Registers of that Court which were Burnt, and a Judicatory in <HI>Scotland</HI> for Redressing Grievances, and Judging Causes which formerly were Judged by the Privy Council, such as the Growth of Popery, and other Irregulari∣ties, and with which Judicature, the Church may correspond anent Fasts and Thanksgivings.</ITEM>
<ITEM>V. Likewise we do humbly Represent, That in the Second Part of the Oath of Abjuration in Favours of the Succession in the Prote∣stant Line, there is Reference made to some Acts of the <HI>English</HI> Parli∣ament, which every one in this Nation who may be Obliged to take the said Oath, may not so well know, and therefore cannot Swear with Judgment. As also, there seems to us, some Qualifications re∣quired in the Successor to the Crown, which are not suitable to our Principles.</ITEM>
<ITEM>VI. And in the last Place, In Case this proposed Treaty of Union shall be concluded, This Nation will be subjected in its Civil Interests, to a <HI>British</HI> Parliament; Wherein Twenty six Prelates are to be Constituent Members and Legislators. And lest our Silence should be Constructed to Import our Consent to, or Approbation of the Civil Places and Power of Church Men; We crave Leave in all Humility, and due Respect to your Grace and Honourable Estates of Parliament, to Represent, that its Contrary to our known Prin∣ciples and Covenants, That any Church Man should bear civil Offi∣ces, or have Power in the Common Wealth.</ITEM>

<P>The Articles are as follows.<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That the Sacramental Test being the Condition of Access to Places of Trust, and to Benefites from the Crown, All of our Com∣munion must be Debarred from the same, if not in <HI>Scotland,</HI> yet through the Rest of the Dominion of <HI>Britain,</HI> which may prove of most dangerous consequence to this Church.</ITEM>

<DIV2 TYPE="reasons">
<HEAD>Against which Articles and Address Proposed, the saids Elders did before the Vote protest, and take Instru∣ments in the Hands of the Clerk of the Commission; <HI>For the Reasons following.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="1">1. The Commission of the <HI>General Assembly</HI> having already Addrest to the Parliament for Securing the Doctrine, Worship, Dis∣cipline and Government of this Church; And that Address being read in the House upon the 17<HI>th</HI> of <HI>October</HI> last, The Parliament did thereupon Declare, that before concluding the Ʋnion, they would take the said Address to their Consideration, and would do every Thing necessary for securing the true Protestant Religion and Church Government presently by Law established in this Kingdom; Which Assurance we conceive the Commission may very well rely u∣pon, Seeing it is not to be doubted, that the Parliament will in due Time when the Address is taken to Consideration, make all necessa∣ry Provisions for Securing our Religion and Church Government by Law established; And it may be constructed Jealousie or Diffidence in this Commission to press and pursue the said Address further, be∣fore
<PB N="17" REF="616"/>
it appear what Steps and Progress the Parliament shall make u¦pon it, Especially seeing there are so many Elders of this Commission who are Members of the House: And being heartily Concerned for the Churches Interest, will certainly take Care that Nothing be Om∣mitted or forgot to be Represented in Parliament which is Necessary for the Churches Security.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Parliament having upon the 15<HI>th</HI> of <HI>October</HI> last, Voted to proceed presently to the Consideration of the Articles of the Treaty of Ʋnion, which might be Known to all by the published Minutes, We conceive it not Decent or suitable to the Prudence of this Com∣mission to present an new Address Relating to the Subject of the for∣mer: whereby the House may be impeded in its Procedure, which may cause a longer Delay of Considering the first Address by Occasio∣ning new Questions and Debates in the House.</P>
<P N="3">3. The 6<HI>th</HI> Article of the now intended Address, contains Matters which we conceive are not within the Sphere and Compass of the Commissions Business prescribed to them by the <HI>General Assembly.</HI> Yet a wide Step is made in quarrelling and Objecting to the Constitution of the Parliament of <HI>England</HI> the Representative of that Nation, with which this is now in a Treaty about an Union, likeways in that Ar∣ticle the Form and Frame of the Civil Policy and Government of <HI>England,</HI> in the Extent and Latitude of it, Agreeable to it's Laws is Reflected upon and Challenged; all which in our Opinion, In∣sinuates a Blaming and Condemning our Parliament for Treating of an Union with a Kingdom so Circumstantiated as <HI>England</HI> is.</P>
<P N="4">4. Whatever the Constitution of the Parliament of <HI>England</HI> now is, and whatever may be the Constitution of the Parliament of <HI>Great Britain</HI> after the Union, the present legal Establishment of our Church is not alterable by it, that being without the bounds of the Treaty, which can reach no farther than the Civil Policy and Go∣vernment of the United Kingdom; Besides that our legal Establish∣ment will no doubt be further Fenced and Fortified, when the Com∣missions Address is taken into Consideration by the Parliament.</P>
<P N="5">5. The Parliament having upon the fourth of this Month, Voted that the two Kingdoms of <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>England,</HI> shall upon the first Day of <HI>May</HI> next Ensuing, and for ever after be Ʋnited into one Kingdom by the Name of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> with this Provision (That if the Articles of Union be not adjusted by the Parliament, then the Agreeing to and Approving of the first shall be of no Effect) We Ap∣prehend it may be of Dangerous Consequence to present now any Address which may Admit of a Construction opposite to that Vote in Parliament; And certainly it would not be Excuseable in any who are Members in the House, to concurr in an Address of that sort.</P>
<P>So being fully perswaded that the way of proceeding by the New Address now intended, will tend to the great Disadvantage and Prejudice of the Church as now Established, and of the Presbyterian Interest, we found our selves obliged to Enter our Dissent and to Protest.</P>

<HEAD>The Commission of the General Assembly, Reply to the Reasons given by the Elders for their Protest, Entituled, <HI>Some Modest Animadversions by way of Re∣ply to a Paper Intituled,</HI> Reasons &amp;c. <HI>ut Supra.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT was a great Grief to the Commission, when it pleased some of our Honourable Friends of the Ruling Elders to protest against the Vote, Whether the 6<HI>th</HI> Article of the Commissions second Address should be added to the other Articles formerly Agreed to; and it doth add no little to our Grief, that a Paper is given in with Reasons as against the whole Address; Whereas they may Remem∣ber the first three of the Articles of the said Adress were unanimously Agreed unto before.</P>
<P>We do sincerly profess, We have such a Sense of, and Confidence in the Kindness of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se Noble and Honourable Persons to this Church, that it Afflicts us, when in any thing we cannot comply with their Opinion; But we hope they will Excuse us when purely our Consci∣ence towards God, maketh us Differ.</P>
<P>We Heartily Wish this debate Sopite, and that yet it would please them to take up this Paper, perhaps on more Mature and second Thoughts, they may see there is no Ground to be so severe against our second Address, As to Censure it as Jealousie or Diffidence of the Parliament or our Friends in it, as in the first Reasons; and of Indecency and Unsuitable to Prudence, as Reason second, or Dan∣gerous and such as may be construed, as contrary to a Vote of Parlia∣ment <HI>November</HI> 4<HI>th</HI> as in Reason 5<HI>th.</HI> For the first Address being General, the second was but a humble Representation of some par∣ticulars we humbly desired might be minded, when it pleased the Par∣liament to resume the Consideration of the first Address, leaving the time to the Wisdom of the Parliament, we being far from any design to occasion Delay or Debate; and it hath pleased the Parliament to in∣sert diverse of the Things there desired in the Act for the <HI>Security of the Church,</HI> and we would gladly hope they will consider the rest of them in due time.</P>
<P>But we conceive it is the 6<HI>th</HI> Article against which the chief Offence is taken, and against which the 3<HI>d</HI> and 4<HI>th</HI> Reasons are levelled, but our Honourable Friends know, there had been much Reasoning on that Head for diverse days, and when there was no appearance of Ʋnanimity, how could the Commission shun a Vote for Decision of the Difference, nor can we be perswaded that the Commission went in their Vote without the Sphere and Compass of the Business pre∣scribed to them by the General Assembly, or made a wide Step in quarrelling and objecting to the Constitution of the Parliament of <HI>England,</HI> as is alledged in Reason 3<HI>d.</HI> For it was oft told in the Con∣ference
<PB N="19" REF="618"/>
and Debate, we did not meddle with the Constitution of the Parliament of <HI>England,</HI> as the Parliament of <HI>England,</HI> though we can∣not command our Judgment to an Approbation of it; nor do we speak any thing against treating with the Parliament of <HI>England,</HI> as the Representative of that Nation, nor doth it blame our Parliament for treating with them, for they treat with the Parliament of <HI>Scotland</HI> as the Representative of the Nation; Which as theirs is in its Frame established by the Laws of the Land, yet a Regulation thereof is treat∣ed of for constituting the <HI>British</HI> Parliament, why then should there be so much Offence taken, that in due Season before the Conclusion of the Treaty, it is humbly represented to the Parliament, that in case the proposed Treaty of Union be concluded, this Nation will be subjected in its civil Interests to a <HI>British</HI> Parliament, wherein 26 Pre∣lates are to be constituent Members and Legislators.</P>
<P>We do not speak in that 6<HI>th</HI> Article of the legal Establishment of our Church, and so the 4<HI>th</HI> Reason toucheth not this Point:</P>
<P>And could any thing be more modestly exprest than this is by the Commission in their Address, in these Words.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'And lest our Silence should be constructed to import our Consent to, or Approbation of the civil Places and Power of Church-men, we crave leave in all humility and due Respect to your Grace and ho∣nourable Estates of Parliament, to represent that it is contrary to our known Principles and Covenants, that any Church Man should bear civil Offices, or have power in the Common-Wealth.</Q></P>
<P>Nor can we see how this Address doth of its own Nature tend to the Disadvantage of the established Church and Presbyterian Interest.</P>
<P>But as we have Charity towards them, we expect the same Charity towards us, acting purely from Conscience towards GOD, and we in∣treat and expect the continuance of their Kindness to this Church.</P>

<P>THAT We considering the Trust reposed in us by the late Gene∣ral Assembly; Find it our Duty to lay before Your Grace and Lordships, when, as we are informed, you are about the passing of an Act of Ratification of the Articles of the Treaty of Ʋnion betwixt the two Kingdoms of <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>England,</HI> which contains these fol∣lowing Words; <Q REND="inline">'Declaring nevertheless, that the Parliament of <HI>En∣gland,</HI> may provide for the Security of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> as they shall think Expedient, to take Place within the Bounds of the said Kingdom of <HI>England,</HI> and not derogating from the Security a∣bove provided, for establishing the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> within the Bounds of this Kingdom, which shall not suspend or derogate from the Force and Effect of this present Ratification, but shall be under∣stood as here included, without any Necessity of any new Raticfia∣tion in the Parliament of <HI>Scotland:</HI></Q> Which Clause seems to us, not only to be like a <HI>Blank,</HI> put, with Your Grace and Lordships Consent, in the Hands of the Parliament of <HI>England,</HI> to Enact what they shall Think fit, for Securing the Hierarchy and Ceremonies of their Church; But also a Consent that it be an Article and Fundamental of the U∣nion; And as is contained in Your Ratification, cannot but imply a Manifest Homologation.</P>

We do therefore humbly beseech Your Grace and Lordships, That there be no such Stipulation, or Consent for the Esta∣blishment of that Hierarchy and Ceremonies, as you would not involve your selves and this Nation in <HI>Guilt,</HI> and as you consult the <HI>Peace</HI> and <HI>Quiet</HI> of this Nation, both in <HI>Church</HI> and <HI>State.</HI> We pray that GOD may Bless and Preserve our gracious <HI>Queen,</HI> and direct your Grace and Lordships in this and all the great and momentuous Affairs, which are or may be before you.</P>

<P>THAT We having seen the several Faithful and Seasonable Ad∣dresses and Representations of our Brethren of the Commission, to your Grace and Lordships; all which we concur in, and agree to, as expressive of our Known and Covenanted Principles; and tho it may appear unnecessar, that we should give your Grace and the Honourable Estates of Parliament any Trouble this way; yet from a Sense of the Duty we owe to GOD at this Juncture, to our Gracious Sovereign Queen <HI>Anne</HI> (whom the Lord long preserve for a Blessing to this Church and Nation) and to your Grace and Lord∣ships; We could not forbear in all humility to Represent, how much we are Alarm'd, with the present Scheme of Ʋnion in the Printed Ar∣ticles, as apprehending the Fatal Consequences thereof, in the Event of a <HI>British</HI> Parliament to our Sacred and Religious Concerns, and to which we can not go in, without Guilt before GOD, in a manifest Breach of our Solemn Covenants, by which we are Ingaged, against Ecclesiastical Persons being Legislators in the Common Wealth. (The Setting up of publick Mass, and <HI>English</HI> Ceremonies, The Illegal and Disorderly Practices of the Episcopal Clergy, from the Hopes of a Popish Successor to the Crown, without any effectual Redress from the Government, notwithstanding of repeated Application made by this Church) do give just Umbrage of what may be expected, when

<OPENER>Sheweth,</OPENER>
<P>THAT we heartily concur with the Addresses made by the Com∣mission of the General Assembly to your Grace and Lordships and do believe that there is a full Unanimity therein amongst the Mi∣nisters of this National Church, both as to the matter of these Addresses, and in their humble and earnest Desires that the Honourable Estates of Parliament may take them into further Consideration, to prevent the Fears and Dangers of this Church, that may insue from an In∣corporating Union with <HI>England</HI> in the Terms of the Treaty offered, to the Parliament.</P>
<P>But that which more especially obliges us in Duty and Conscience as Ministers of the Gospel of Peace, most humbly to interpose with your Grace and Lordships is, the Lamentable and Distracted State of the Kingdom, and particularly the People under our Pastoral Charge, from the sad Apprehensions they have, and have expressed in their se∣veral Addresses to the Parliament, of the woeful Effects and Conse∣quences of such an Union to their Liberties both Civil and Religious, and that it cannot be entered into by the Nation in the Terms with∣out incurring the Guilt of National Perjury: And tho' hitherto we have endeavoured to keep them from Breaking out, yet the Ferment and Dissatisfaction doth so encrease amongst all, that we are justly a∣fraid of what these Things may turn unto.</P>
<P>We do therefore (after serious Supplication at the Throne of Grace) most earnestly Implore, and with all humility beseech in the Bowels of our LORD JESUS CHRIST, That your Grace and Lordships may compassionate the trembling State of this Church and Nation, and listen as it were to their dying Groans: GOD having put it in your Hands to allay their Fears, avert their Dangers, and

prevent the dreadful Confusions that threaten this Land, by laying aside this Incorporating Ʋnion with <HI>England,</HI> as offered in the Trea∣ty, and by supplicating Her most Gracious Majesty (for whose long and happy Reign over us; We do, and always shall most heartily Pray, and upon whose Royal Assurances in Behalf of this Church, we do most cheerfully rely) that the Protestant Succession to the So∣vereign and independent Crown of this Kingdom may be settled by an Act of our own Parliament: And that no Incorporating Ʋnion with <HI>England</HI> may be concluded, until Her Majesty shall be pleased to call the General Assembly of this Church; which being the National Church established by Law, and founded on the Nations <HI>Claim of Right,</HI> hath an undoubted Right to be consulted about Her own Securities, before any such Ʋnion be entered into with a Govern∣ment of another Communion, where that Government is to be in a Manner sole Master of the whole Administration.</P>
<P>These things we most humbly beg of your Grace and Lordships, as our Protectors and Patrons under God, beseeching you to hearken unto us, that God may hearken unto you, and give you Peace and Comfort in the Day of your Accompts.</P>

<P>YOur Letter signed by the R: Mr. <HI>Carstairs</HI> Moderator <HI>pro tem Pore</HI> we received this Day, being our first Meeting after its Date of the 6th Instant; wherein there is mention of your being informed of Disorders and Tumults in some parts of the Countrey, which you recommend unto us to discountenance and discoursge as we have Access.</P>
<P>We know there have been many Reports spread Abroad of Tu∣mults and Disorders, not only in <HI>Glasgow,</HI> which is too true, but in other places within the Shire of <HI>Lanerk;</HI> which as to the bounds of our Presbytery are grosly false. And we have reason to believe them to be so likewise, as to the rest of the Shire. We have heard also of some calumnious Stories industriously disseminated, concerning some of our Number, with respect to these pretended Disorders, which are not only contrary to Truth, but to common Sense. We wish the Forgers and Spreaders may be forgiven. They act in this neither the part of good Christians, nor of good Subjects.</P>
<P>As to the Disposition of the People, the plain Truth is, That they are generally most averse from the Union; and many have expressed themselves broadly enough against it, as what they fear may prove an irremediable Evil, if it should be concluded, wishing that some Stop might be put to it. And we have not been wanting, as there was occasion, to advise and exhort the People to Calmness and Regularity, and to refrain from any undue Keenness might be in their Words. But we must say, That it is utterly false and malicious to suggest, that there hath been the least Tumult or irregular Practice among them, since this Ʋnion came in Question, far less any shadow or Appearance of any Undutiful or Disloyal Thought of Her Majesty. Yea there has not been so much as the least Motion towards their accustomed ordinary Rendezvous warranted by Law, since the publishing of a Proclamation and Act, forbidding the same: It is true, That some of those Rash Youths who broke out from <HI>Glasgow,</HI> passed thro' our Bounds, but they were not allowed to make any stay, nor received the least En∣couragement at any Hand, for ought we know: So that we can well assure the R. Commission, there is as much Peace and Quiet with∣in the whole Bounds of this Presbytery, as is any Place of the King∣dom.</P>
<P>We have heard with much Satisfaction, of the Zeal which the R.
<PB N="27" REF="626"/>
Commission hath shewed by their Addresses mentioned in your Letter for the Interests of the Church at this Time, when they are in so E∣minent Hazard. And we have testified our Concurrence therewith by our Address to the Parliament: But we are still of Opinion, That the pressing Necessity of the present Juncture, and the manifest Im∣possibility (in the Event of such an Union, as is Moulded in the Treaty) of securing this Church in any of Her precious Concerns, now Established by the Laws and Constitution of our own Govern∣ment and Kingdom, doth not only require the Continuance of Assi∣dous Application to the Right Honourable Estates of Parliament: But likewise, that the Commission, in Name of this Church, testify a∣gainst the concluding of any Ʋnion with <HI>England,</HI> upon the Foot of this Treaty, till the General Assembly of this National Church, ac∣cording to Her undoubted Right, as we have shewed in our Address be called and Allowed to consider of Solid and Essential Securities for the Church in such an Exigence. This we humbly think, the Trust reposed in the Commission, and Faithfulness to the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> both in the present and succeeding Generations doth unde∣nyably Demand.

<HEAD>MEMORANDUM For the Honourable Estates of Parliament.</HEAD>
<P><HI>PRimo,</HI> It is humbly intreated, That in case the Ʋnion be con∣cluded, that for preserving the Peace of the Nation and Re∣dressing of Grievances of the Church, the Privy Council may be continued, or some Court Established for judging in such Cases as were formerly judged by the Council, and this Church may corres∣pond with them for Fasts and Thanksgivings. <HI>Secundo,</HI> The Interests of diverse Heretors, as well as the Exigents of the Church will require, that there be some fixed Court to do the Work of the Commission for Plantation of Kirks and Valuation of Teinds, which is the more ne∣cessary, in respect of the great prejudice the Church has sustained for want thereof, and that this Court be impowered to make up the Re∣gisters of the Commissions of former Parliaments that were burnt in the great Fire in <HI>Edinburgh. Tertio,</HI> Seeing the Terms of an Oath should be clear, that it may be taken in Truth, in Righteousness and Judgment; It is desired, That if the <HI>English</HI> Abjuration Oath be re∣quired of <HI>Scots-Men,</HI> the Words may be made plain and clear with∣out reference to <HI>English</HI> Statutes, which are not known here, and that what the Taker of the said Oath is to be obliged to, be expresly insert in the said Oath, and that the same be agreeable to our known Prin∣ciples. <HI>Quarto,</HI> Seeing upon the event of an Union there ought to be a Commuication of all Privileges and Advantages which do or may belong to the Subjects of either Kingdom: It is intreated, That due Provision be made, that in case of any Ʋnion <HI>Scots-Men</HI> may be capa∣ble of places of Power and Trust in all places of <HI>Britain,</HI> without any Obligation to take the <HI>English Sacramental</HI> TEST; for that, besides what may be said of the Danger that way to prophane that Holy Ordi∣nance, it may prove a Temptation to divers to conform, who other∣ways would not do it, and this way by degrees bring in Corruption to this Church. <HI>Quinto,</HI> Seeing the Eccesiastical Supremacy claimed some time by the Sovereigns in this Land, was such an Encroachment on the Prerogative of our Lord JESUS CHRIST, the alone Head and King of His Church, and had such sad Consequences, and is now so happily rescinded: It is humbly intreated, that all possible Security be provided against the reassuming of it in after time.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>May it please your Grace.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Could not have Peace in my own Mind Night or Day, until I made this Discovery of a Plot, so clossly laid against your Grace, that the World could not have discovered, unless it had pleased God thus to touch my Conscience, or some others of the Conspirators; Wherefore I shall give your Grace a short Account of the true Matter of Fact, without the least Dissembling. Ʋpon <HI>Thursday</HI> last at 12 a Clock at Night, there came a Gentleman to my House, who whis∣per'd in mine Ear while I was in Bed, to go along with him in all haste, so I got up out of Bed and went with him, he led me into a Chamber, where I met Seven other young Men, who welcom'd me to the place, and after a little Talk, told me they were upon a Bu∣siness which they could not effect without me, which was to dispatch that Treacherous Devil the Commissioner (so they were pleased to call your Grace) I, God forgive me, joyned with them heartily, whereupon they produced a Paper, containing a most horrid Oath,
<PB N="60" REF="663"/>
whereby they bound themselves to Assassinate your Grace the first day the Parliament sat after New-years-day, and that they should ra∣ther be burned alive than discover their Fellows—Two and Twenty has subscribed this Oath with their Blood.</P>
<P>They said they wanted only Two to compleat their Number for the Work, they desiring to have Twenty Four concerned in it, some of these your Grace would little suspect, but these that are to be the main Actors, are the most graceless debauch'd Wretches in the World, that fear neither God nor Man, some of them are to be cloathed in the Highland Dress, one in the Habit of a Beggar with a false Beard, six of them are to be in the Habit of Baxters, that by this means they may with the more ease raise the Rabble, one of those in Highland Dress is to stand on your left hand as you come out of the Parliament-House, with a naked Durk beneath his Plaid to stab your Grace; But if he has no Opportunity for Action, then the Beg∣gar is to attend your Coach with a Pistol beneath his Rags, which he is to fire at your Grace, at which the Baxters are to raise the Rabble with their Crys, which they think will soon be done; Then lest your Grace should escape with Life, they are to take care to get the <HI>Nether-Bow</HI> Port closed in spight of the Guards: Their next de∣sign is upon the Chancellor, <HI>Philiphaugh,</HI> and some others; After repeated Oaths of Secrecie we parted about 3 a Clock this Morning, and I came home, but perplexing Thoughts so Tormented me, that I could neither Sleep, Eat or Drink till I cased my Mind with this Dis∣covery. If your Grace will assure me of Pardon, and that you will obtain me a Remission from the Queen for this and an other Crime, which the Conspirators will alledge for revenge I was guilty of ten Years ago abroad, I will come to your Graces Lodging and make a full Discovery of this whole Design, and let your Grace see their Names written with their own Hands, and with their own Blood, for they put so much Trust in me, as that they gave it me in keeping; Your Grace may take your own Method in making it known, if you will pardon me and protect me; which if your Grace do, I shall not fail to perform my Promise, and tell your Grace other Circumstances than can recite here.</P>

<P>A protest was given in by <HI>George Lockhart</HI> of <HI>Carnwath,</HI> in these terms.<Q>I <HI>George Lockhart</HI> of <HI>Carnwath</HI> do protest for my self, and in Name of such other Barons as shall adhere to this my Protestation; That nei∣ther this Vote, nor any other Vote, Conclusion or Article in this Treaty of Union, shall prejudge the Barons of this Kingdom from their full Representation in Parliament, as now by Law established, nor any of their Privileges, and particularly their Judicative and Legislative Capacities, of which they are deprived by the Terms of this Treaty of Union: And I crave this my Protestation to be Admitted and Record∣ed.</Q></P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="Lxx" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>N<SUP>o</SUP> L. <HI>x x.</HI></HEAD>
<P>And another Protest was given in by the Duke of <HI>Athole,</HI> in these Terms.<Q><P>WHereas, by my Protest given in the 4th. of <HI>November</HI> last, before voting the first Article of Union, I did reserve Liberty to renew Protestations against any other Article of the Treaty: And as I prote∣sted for the Reasons therein mentioned, so I do now, for my self and all others who shall adhere, protest against any Vote for approving the 22<HI>d.</HI> Article of this Treaty of Union, and against all the Parts of it, for these Reasons, Because the Peers of this Realm, who are hereditary Members of Her Majesties Great Council and Parliament, do thereby become E∣lective, and so Her Majesty is deprived of Her born Counsellors, and the Peers of their Birth-right. And whereas they are at present 160 in Number, they are by this Article, reduced to 16; which 16 are to be joyned with the House of Lords in <HI>England,</HI> whose Number at present consists of a∣bove 180, whereby it is plain, that the <HI>Scots</HI> Peers share in the Legisla∣tive and Judicative Powers in the <HI>British</HI> Parliament is very unequal with that of the <HI>English,</HI> tho the one be Representatives of as Free and Inde∣pendent a Nation as the other; and is therefore a plain Forfeiture of the Peerage of this Kingdom. And as it is the hight of Injustice, and against all the Laws and Practices of this and all other well govern'd Nations to forfeit any Person without a hainous Crime; So its against all Law to forfeit either the Peers that are now present, or those that are Minors or Absent, without being so much as called or cited for that end.</P>
<P>It is likewise contrary to the Honour and true Interest of Her Majesty and the Monarchy, to suppress the Estate of Peers, who have formerly been the great Supporters of the Monarchy.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="670"/>
And it is Dishonourable and Disgraceful to this Kingdom, that the Peers thereof shall only have Rank and Precedency next after the Peers of the like Order and Degree in <HI>England,</HI> without regard to their Antiquity, or the Dates of their Patents, as is stipulate by the following Articles of this Treaty.</P>
<P>In the next place, each Shire and Royal Burgh within this Kingdom have the Number of their Representatives determined by Acts of Parlia∣ment, whose Number at present being 155, are by this Article of the Treaty, reduced to 45, and to be joyned to 513 Members in the House of Commons, where they can have no Influence, by reason of the vast Dis∣proportion of their Numbers, besides, that the Barons and Burrows of this Nation, by this way of Uniting, are deprived of their inherent Right of being fully and individually represented in Parliament, both with relation to their legislative and judicative Capacities.</P>
<P>And they are not only highly prejudged in lessening their Representa∣tion, but also degraded from being Members of the Parliaments of this Kingdom, where they sit as Judges in all Causes Civil and Criminal, to be joyned to the Commons of another Nation, who are accustomed to sup∣plicate for Justice at the Bar of the House of Lords.</P>
<P>The Barons and Burgesses are also further prejudged in this; That whereas every Shire and Royal Burgh have their own Representatives, one Commissioner will hereafter represent several Shires or Burghs, who it cannot be supposed will understand the several Interests and Concerns of the said several Shires and Burghs whom he may represent.</P>
<P>And further, for the present Representatives of the Barons and Bur∣gesses to offer, by any Vote or Deed of theirs, to incapacitate their Constituents, or deprive them of any part of their inherent Right, is what their Constituents may and do justly dissallow, they only having their Commissions with the ordinary Powers of making and amending Laws, and giving Supplys, but no ways to alter Fundamental Constitu∣tions, or to take away or diminish their Representation, which is also a plain Forfeiture of their Constituents of their inherent Rights and undoubt∣ed Privileges, and is contrary to the fundamental Laws of this Nation, which are the Birth-right of the People thereof.</P>
<P>From all which it is plain and evident, That this, from a Sovereign In∣dependent Monarchy, shall dissolve its Constitution, and be at the dispo∣sal of <HI>England,</HI> whose Constitution is not in the least to be altered by this Treaty, and where it is not to be supposed the <HI>Scots</HI> shall have any weight in the making of Laws, even tho' relative to their own Kingdom, by rea∣son of the vast Disproportion and Disparity of the Representation afore∣said.</P>
<P>And therefore I do also Protest, that no Vote may hinder or prejudge the Noblemen, Barons and Burgesses, as now represented in Parliament, to Retain, Bruik, Enjoy and Exerce all their Rights, Liberties and Privi∣leges, as fully and freely as hitherto they have enjoyed them.</P>
<P>And since it evidently appears, not only from the many Protests of the Honourable and Worthy Members of this House, but also from the Multi∣tudes of Addresses and Petitions, from the several Parts of this Kingdom, of the Barons, Free-holders, Heretors, Burgesses and Commons, and from the Commission of the General Assembly, that there is a general Dislike and Aversion from the Incorporating Union, as contained in these Articles; And that there is not one Address, from any part of the King∣dom, in favours of this Union.</P>
<P>I do therefore further protest against concluding this and the following
<PB N="72" REF="671"/>
Articles of this Treaty, until HerMajesty shall be fully informed of the In clinations of the People; That if HerMajesty think fit, She may call a new Parliament to have immediate Sentiments of the Union since the Articles have been made publick, where it's hoped they may fall on such Methods as may allay the Ferment of the Nation, satisfie the Minds of the People, and create a full Understanding betwixt the two Kingdoms, by an Union upon honourable, just and equal Terms, which may unite them in Affecti∣on and Interest, the surest Foundation of Peace and Tranquility for both Kingdoms: And this my Protestation I desire may be received, and insert in the Minutes, and recorded in the Books of Parliament, as a Testimony of my Disassent, and the Disassent of such as adhere to me.</P></Q></P>

<P>And a Third Protest was given in by the Earl of <HI>Buchan,</HI> in these Terms.<Q><P>FOrasmuch as, the changing of the Right of the Peers of this Realm, from a constant and hereditary Right, to one that is elective; and the debarring all or any of them from taking place, and voting in Par∣liaments, Conventions, or publick Councils, is subversive of the Birth-right, and undoubted Privilege of the Peers, dishonourable to the whole Kingdom, and contrary to the fundamental Laws and Constitutions of it; as well as to all Justice and Equity: I do therefore Protest for my self, and in Name of all who shall adhere to this my Protestation, that the foresaid Right of the Peers of this Realm to Sit and Vote in all Parlia∣ments, publick Councils and Conventions, do, after the intended Uni∣on with <HI>England,</HI> and notwithstanding thereof, continue in full Force, and remain to them as their undoubted Right and Property, and that no Vote to be passed in this House, do prejudge all or any of them thereof, or debar them from retaining the same in all time coming.</P></Q></P>

<P>WE your Majesties most Loyal and Dutiful Subjects, the <HI>General Convention</HI> of the <HI>Royal Burrows</HI> in this part of your Majesties U∣nited Kingdom called <HI>Scotland,</HI> Do most humbly represent, That having received several grievous Complaints from the trading Merchants, how that they upon the Faith of the late Treaty of Union betwixt the
<PB N="77" REF="676"/>
two Kingdoms, Ratified in both their Parliaments, have from several Ports of <HI>Scotland</HI> sent to <HI>London,</HI> and several Ports in <HI>England</HI> Goods and Merchandize allowed to be imported to <HI>Scotland,</HI> and actually there im∣ported before the Union, for which they not only paid Your Majesties Du∣ty; But being resolved upon the Faith of the said Treaty to send them to <HI>England,</HI> after due Deliberation, they by Warrant from <HI>England</HI> re∣ceived Coast-Cocquets and other ordinary Documents from Your Majestys Commissioners of the Customs lately established, and did also to cut off all pretext, make faith before the Lords of Your Majesties Treasury and Exchequer, and other Judges, That the Goods were imported upon their own proper Account, and upon their own proper Risque.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding whereof, they have very surprising Accounts from their Correspondents in <HI>England,</HI> that the Commissioners of Your Maje∣sties Customs there, have given Orders to seize their Ships and Goods, and that some of them are actually seized, and others both seized and imbezzelled, and that the best Conditions they can obtain from Your Maje∣sties said Commissioners in <HI>England,</HI> are; That they should give Se∣curity or Bail in some cases for Ship and Cargo, and in other Cases, for paying new and high Duties, at the Determination of the <HI>British</HI> Par∣liament: All which being in our humble Apprehension nothing agree∣able, but contrary to the Faith of the said Articles of Treaty, and a ma∣nifest Disappointment of these Advantages and Encouragements that we still did, and do firmly promise our selves from Your Majesties Royal Justice and most gracious Government, and with all such visible Hard∣ships as must be the Loss and even the Ruin of many honest Traders, who cannot bear their Ships and Goods to be thus incumbred by Bail and Law-suits, or double and high Duties, and withal subjected to the Delay and Hazard of uncertain Determination.</P>
<P>We cannot but in the greatest Submission whereof we are capable, and with a yet greater Confidence of Your Majesties Royal Justice and Good∣ness, whereof we have had so great and innumerable Proofs, lay the Case before Your Majesty as it is, <HI>viz.</HI> That by the first Article of the Treaty of Union, the two Kingdoms are for ever united into one after the first of <HI>May</HI> last, which plainly after that day excludes the very Notion of Importation, or Importers betwixt them, and all former Restrictions and Penalties imposed thereupon: And by the Fourth Article, It is agreed that all the Subjects of the said united Kingdom shall from and after the Union, have full Freedom and Intercourse of Trade to and from any Port or Place within the said united Kingdom, and that there be a Communi∣cation of all other Rights and Privileges which do or may belong to the Subjects of either Kingdom; By which it is plain, that we have the same Privilege to transport our Effects notwithstanding of former Restraints from one part of <HI>Britain</HI> to another, which Your Majesties Subjects of <HI>Berwick, Newcastle, Bristol,</HI> &amp;c. do injoy in importing now to <HI>Scotland,</HI> without any Comptrol all such Goods both of <HI>English</HI> and Foreign Manu∣facture and Growth, as were before the Union expresly prohibite by our Laws: And farther, by the 25 and last Article of the said Treaty, It is by <HI>Statute Enacted,</HI> that all Laws and Statutes in either Kingdom, so far as they are contrary to, and inconsistent with the Articles of the U∣nion, shall from and after the Union cease and become void; Whereby it evidently appears, that the Prohibitions and Restrictions that might have been of Force on either side, while we were separate Kingdoms, are now made void and for ever to cease.</P>
<P>Being then founded upon such clear and evident Grounds, and yet much more upon the assuring Experiences that we have always had of
<PB N="78" REF="677"/>
Your Majesties Justice, Equity, and unparallel'd Goodness: We do with all Submission and Humility, Beseech and Obtest Your Majesty, that You would be pleased to give such Orders to Your High Treasurer and Commissioners of Customs, and others in <HI>England,</HI> that the aforesaid hea∣vy and vexatious Grievances may be remeded and removed, that so the Hearts and Interests of all Your good Subjects may be united to Your Ma∣jesties Satisfaction and perpetual Glory.</P>

<HEAD>The <HI>CLAUSE</HI> proposed in the <HI>English</HI> Par∣liament to prevent the <HI>French</HI> Goods being Imported thro' <HI>Scotland.</HI></HEAD>

<HEAD>The Humble ADDRESS of the <HI>Scots</HI> Merchants at <HI>London,</HI> to the Right Honourable the Lords Spiritual and Tem∣poral Assembled in Parliament, against Passing the Bill, for laying Duties upon Goods which may be brought by Her Majesties Subjects, from <HI>Scotland</HI> to <HI>England</HI> af∣ter the Commencement of the UNION.</HEAD>
<P>BY the Articles of UNION most solemnly ratified in <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>En∣gland,</HI> It is expresly declar'd, That from and after the first of <HI>May</HI> 1707, the two Kingdoms shall be United into one, called <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and that all the Subjects of either Kingdom, shall have full Free∣dom and Intercourse of Trade and Navigation, to and from any Port or Place within the said united Kingdom; and that there shall be a Communi∣cation of all other Rights, Privileges and Advantages, which do or may belong to the Subjects of either Kingdom:</P>
<P>It is humbly conceived, that the Bill now before your Lordships, is direct∣ly contrary to these Articles of Union; for nothing can be a greater hin∣derance to the Freedom and Intercourse of Trade, than the laying such high Duties on Goods brought from <HI>Scotland</HI> to <HI>England,</HI> as are by this Bill in∣tended to be impos'd on Her Majesty's <HI>English</HI> Subjects, and the <HI>Scots</HI> re∣siding here, whereby they are deprived of their just Right of bringing Goods from <HI>Scotland</HI> to <HI>England</HI> by <HI>Transire</HI> Duty free, which is plainly granted to them by the fourth Article of Union, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The Exception in this Bill pretended to be in favour of the Natives of <HI>Scotland</HI> residing there, destroys their Privileges also; because it only al∣lows them to bring such Goods Duty free into <HI>England</HI> after the Union com∣mences, as have been before that time laden beyond Seas, and imported into <HI>Scotland</HI> on their own Accounts, but not to bring any such as they have bought, or may buy at their own Markets, whereby this Retrospect Bill will stop the Circulation of Trade, and entail Ruin on all the Tra∣ders
<PB N="80" REF="679"/>
in <HI>Scotland,</HI> by confining such Quantities of Goods to that part of <HI>Great Britain</HI> as will exceed the Consumption thereof.</P>
<P>The <HI>Scots</HI> being also hinder'd by this Bill from bringing Duty free unto <HI>England,</HI> Goods Imported into <HI>Scotland</HI> before the first of <HI>May,</HI> where∣of they have not been the sole Proprietors, from the time they were first Shipp'd off beyond Seas for <HI>Scotland,</HI> until brought into <HI>England;</HI> they will be prevented from bringing their own Parts of any Goods, wherein the <HI>English</HI> had any share at the time of Importation into <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>And a particular Hardship to the <HI>Scots,</HI> the Bill imposes on them the unsupportable <HI>onus probandi,</HI> whereby they will be oblig'd to prove their sole Property from the time of buying the Goods beyond Seas, to their Arrival in <HI>England,</HI> in order whereto their Factors, Mariners, Coopers, Ware-house-keepers, Porters, and a great number of other Servants must be all produced together at the Exchequer Bar, and all maintain'd during their Voyages and Journeys, and Abode in <HI>London;</HI> so that the Evidence necessary on this occasion will cost at least 300 <HI>l. Sterling</HI> for each parcel of Goods, besides all the Delay and Vexation of a tedious Course of Law, and the severe Penalties in case they should, by one Neglect or Misfor∣tune, fail in the least Particular of an absolute Proof.</P>
<P>This Bill will not answer the propos'd End of advancing Her Majesties Revenues, but seems to be founded on mistaken Notions of Trade, since after the Union commences, the Disadvantages, or Conveniencies to <HI>Great Britain</HI> will be equal, whether the Goods then in <HI>Scotland</HI> remain, and be consum'd in that, or any other part of the United Kingdom.</P>
<P>The Allowances granted in some Articles of the Union, whereby the Re∣gulation of minute Circumstances is left to the Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> seems to be an unanswerable Argument, that where no such Li∣berty is given, even the Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> was not intended to have the Power of making any Alterations or Regulations; and as the last Article of the Union confirms the whole by repealing all Laws in either Kingdom, which are contrary to the Articles, This Bill, if it should pass into an act, and all other Laws being inconsistent with the Articles, of any of them, will, as it's humbly conceived, be void after the First of <HI>May.</HI></P>
<P>This Bill differs little from the former sent up to your Lordships last Session, which your Lordships did not then think fit to pass.</P>
<P><HI>Therefore it's hop'd that your Lordships will not pass this Bill, being, as is humbly conceiv'd, more injurious than the former, and which can only serve to advance Distinctions and Animosities between the Subjects of</HI> Scotland <HI>and</HI> England, <HI>and prevent that Union of Hearts, which Her Maiesty so graciously recommended from the Throne.</HI></P>

<P>{inverted ⁂} <HI>Note,</HI> This Bill is unnecessary in reference to Foreigners, who can have no Benefit nor Share in the Communication of Trade and Privileges men∣tioned in the 4th Article of Union, the same being thereby prudently re∣stricted to the Subjects of both Kingdoms.</P>

<HEAD>N<SUP>o</SUP> E 3. OBSERVATIONS UPON THE Fourth Article of UNION.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. EQuity and Reason places the Subjects of the same Kingdom on equal Foot, when they are Cemented together in Affection, Laws, Trade, and Interest, this will be the Case after the Union, when Agreements on each side are fulfilled; but when <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland</HI> were separate, they who submitted, proposed the Terms, and Equiva∣lents of an Union; and when these are granted, and agreed, should be honourably maintained, with the greatest Nicety, and favourable Inter∣pretation to the Weakest. The Reputation of <HI>England</HI> abroad, is found∣ed on the Stability of their Treaties, ss much as on the Strength of their Arms, Treasure, or Constitution.</P>
<P>With the same Strength of Reason and Equity, may the <HI>Scots</HI> desire that <HI>English-</HI>Men, since <HI>February</HI> last, should be subject to the <HI>Onus Probandi,</HI> for Goods in their Possession, imported by Foreigners, or for Account of Foreigners under Covert.</P>
<P>By the same Rule of Reason, that the <HI>English</HI> require an Augmentation of Duties on Goods imported into <HI>England,</HI> may the <HI>Scots</HI> desire that Goods in <HI>England</HI> should be Taxed with <HI>Scots</HI> Duties, and then both King∣doms would be on equal Terms.</P>
<P>The Establishment of the Union, was a Communicatory Contract, a∣greed and fixt, by Persons equal in Knowledge, and Freedom of Will; the Matter in Debate was Proposed, Argued, and Covenanted, afterwards Confirmed in the most Solemn and Authentick Manner, by the Parlia∣ments of both Kingdoms, and cannot now legally, and in a decent or friendly Manner, be touched or amended in any oint, but by the Parli∣ament of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> who are the competent Judges of the Rights, Pri∣vileges, and Conveniencies of the United Kingdoms, when the general Good, Safety and Interest of the whole, will, with it's natural Weight, sway the Ballance of Equity, when <HI>England</HI> will have no Reason to repine at any accidental Advantage, which <HI>Scotland</HI> may get by the Union, at it's Commencement, since it will not only enable, but encourage that Part of the United Kingdom, to undergo with Chearfulness their future Restrictions, and Taxes.</P>
<P N="2">II. To the Second Reason the Answer is plainly obvious, that the Sixth, Seventh, Fifteenth, and Eighteenth Articles of the Union, were consented to by <HI>Scotland,</HI> in Consideration of an Equivalent, and the Sense of the Commissioners, on the Point of Customs, is more fully explained in the Fourteenth Article of Union, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q REND="inline">'That the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland</HI> shall not be charged with any Duties laid on by the Parliament of <HI>England,</HI> before the Union, except these consented to in this Treaty.</Q></P>
<P>Certainly the <HI>Scots</HI> never expected, that in the Interval between the Ratification of the Articles, and the Commencement of the Union, the Parliament of <HI>England</HI> would have laid the <HI>Onus Probandi</HI> upon the
<PB N="82" REF="681"/>
Subjects of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and for a time so far backward, nor that a greater Proof for the Property of Goods, should be required from the Subjects of <HI>Scotland,</HI> than what is stipulated for justifying their Interest in Shipping, by the Fifth Article of Union, by which they are free from all perplex∣ing Tryals at the Exchequer Barr, and are treated therein as Friends, and Men of Probity, by referring the Proof of their Interest, to their proper Oath, to be taken in the Port next to the abode of the Owner; this shows that the <HI>Scots</HI> never would have consented to undergo the <HI>Onus probandi</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> for any Goods in their Possession, belonging to them, at or before the Union.</P>
<P>It was absolutely impossible to attain this Union, without a free Com∣munication of Trade; and in Consequence, as absolutely Impossible to hinder the <HI>Scots</HI> from Trading; as <HI>Scots-men,</HI> in their own Kingdom, until the Union commences; or from trading afterwards, as <HI>Britains,</HI> when the Union takes place. To deny them the first Privilege, is to take a∣way their Birth-right; and to debar them from the latter Advantage, would be a grievous Detriment, and a sensible Injury; because it touch∣es their Property at present, and weakens their Hopes of Advantage in fu∣ture by the Union: At least it will make them think their Title preca∣rious and uncertain.</P>
<P>After the first of <HI>May</HI> 1707, when the Union is to commence, the Goods then brought from <HI>Scotland</HI> to <HI>England,</HI> and <HI>vice versa</HI> can't in any Sense be said to be either Exported or Imported; seeing, whether by Land or Water, they will only be carried from one place to another, within the same Kingdom: And therefore this Matter can no ways be comprehen∣ded under the Sixth Article.</P>
<P N="3">III. To the Third Reason, That the fair Traders of <HI>England</HI> will be great Sufferers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> It may be answer'd, That a certain sort of fair Tra∣ders, commonly distinguish'd by the Character of well-meaning F—s, are greater Sufferers daily, by the cunning Contrivances of Stock-Jobbers, and other over-reaching Practices in Commerce, they would not censure a Man, who can take up Money at 4 <HI>per Cent.</HI> from private Persons, and at the same time can lend it to the Government at 8 <HI>per Cent.</HI> If by the fair Traders, be meant the Wine Merchants or Vintners, those who know their Method of Management, will admire how they have gain'd this Character: Allowing it, however, to them for once, in Complaisance, their Damage will be as soon forgot, as the Loss of a Ship is on the Exchange; and their Loss will be recompensed by a publick Advantage, which hap∣pens but once, and will be of very short Continuance. The Nobility and Gentry of <HI>England</HI> may drink the Queens Health, and Prosperity to the Union, in a Glass of Claret, at 2 <HI>s.</HI> 6 <HI>d. per</HI> Quart; on which the best of the Nation saves 2 <HI>s.</HI> seeing the Vintner sells his mixt Liquor at 4 <HI>s.</HI> 6 <HI>d.</HI> The <HI>Scots</HI> Merchant or Importer from <HI>Scotland</HI> cannot gain nor save by his Sale, one fourth part of what the <HI>English</HI> Nation does; and the Pro∣portion will hold the same, upon whatever Quantities of Goods are Im∣ported from <HI>Scotland,</HI> if it were possible, to the value of a Million of Mo∣ney. The Nation of <HI>England,</HI> in this Time of Jubilee, will be by far the greatest Gainer. If the sole Profit redounds wholly to the <HI>Scots</HI> Mer∣chants, or to the Importers from <HI>Scotland,</HI> then the Price of Goods will be kept at their present Height, and the fair Traders of <HI>England</HI> cannot lose by the Stocks of Goods now on their Hands.</P>
<P N="4">IV. That the Revenue of the Customs will be very much diminished, may be answered, That this is not a real loss, but accidental and ima∣ginary: For without the Union and Freedom of Commerce, those Goods
<PB N="83" REF="682"/>
would not have been imported; and I am perswaded, the Queen would rather lose the Value of the Goods imported, than suffer the Foundation of the Union to be undermined, or Her Subjects in <HI>Scotland</HI> to undergo Hardships, from which, in virtue of this Union, they may so reasonably expect an Exemption. And I believe, all Her Majesties Friends, and Well-wishers to <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> will cordially praise Her Sentiments, and readily concur in suspecting the Assertions of some Gentlemen, as to the Quantities of Goods expected from <HI>Scotland.</HI> These very Persons would not be afraid of finding Money, in a Days time, to purchase the whole at prime Cost, and to put themselves in place of the <HI>Scots:</HI> Then they would cry up the Union as sacred, as the firmest Foundation of our Con∣stitution, and would severely censure the least Encroachment.</P>
<P N="5">V. To the Fifth and most important Reason, The Promoters of the Bill are great Men in their way, but in Comparison with <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> like two Drops of Water to the Ocean; and in their greatest Splendour are only valuable so far, as they are useful to the Common Good; it's humbly conceiv'd, every prudent Man will conclude, it's better to let a few Men grumble, than to disgust a Kingdom, and the best of Queens, by endangering the Constitution of <HI>Great-Britain.</HI></P>

<P><Q REND="inline">THat tho it would seem most proper for the <HI>Scots</HI> to sue to us, who are Superiors in the Field, and Masters of a great part of their Realm; yet that our charitable Mind and Brotherly Love might be known, We do by all means possible provoke and call you to your own Commodity and Profit, as the Father does the Son, or the Elder Brother the young∣er—and invite you to AMITY and EQUALITY, because as We inhabit in the same Island, there is no People so like one another in Man∣ners, Customs and Language—But because some object that we don't seek EQUALITY, nor the Marriage, but a Conquest, and that we would not be Friends but Lords, altho our Proclamation at the last Wars did enough declare the contrary: yet here We declare to you and all Christian People, to be the Kings Majesty's Mind our Master's, by our Advice and Counsel, not to Conquer but to have in Amity, not to win by Force, but to conciliate by Love, not to spoil and kill, but to save and keep, not to dissever and divorce, but to joyn in Marriage from high to low both the Realms, to make of one Isle, one Realm, in Love, Amity, Concord, Peace and Charity—We offer Love, We offer EQUALITY and Amity; We overcome in War and offer Peace;
<PB N="103" REF="702"/>
We win Holds and offer no Conquest; We get in your Land, and offer <HI>England</HI>—What can be more offered and more proffered, THAN IN∣TERCOURSE OF MERCHANDIZES and interchange of Marriages, the abolishing of all such our Laws as prohibit the same, or might be Impe∣diment to the mutual Amity? We have offered not only to leave the Authority, Name, Title, Right or Challenge of Conqueror, but to receive that which is the Shame of Men overcome, to leave the Name of the Nation, and the Glory of any Victory (if any we have had, or should have of you) and to take the indifferent old Name of <HI>Britains</HI> again; be∣cause nothing should be left on our part to be offered, nothing on your part unrefused, whereby ye might be inexcusable.—What Face hath this of Conquest? We intend not to disherit your Queen, but to make Her Heirs Inheritors also of <HI>England.</HI> WE SEEK NOT TO TAKE FROM YOU YOUR LAWS NOR CUSTOMS, but we seek to redress your Oppression, which of divers ye do sustain. In the Realm of <HI>England,</HI> di∣vers Laws and Customs be according to the antient usage thereof, and likewise <HI>France, Normandy</HI> and <HI>Gascoigne</HI> have sundry kind of Orders. Have all the Realms and Dominions that the Emperor now hath, one Custom and one Sort of Laws? These vain Fears and Fantasies of Ex∣pulsion of your Nation, of changing of the Laws, of making a Con∣quest, be driven into your Heads by those, who indeed had rather you were all conquered, spoiled and slain, than they would lose any Point of their Will, of their Desire of Rule, and of their Estimation, which they know in Quietness would be seen what it were, as it were in a Calm Water—If we two being made one by Amity, be most able to defend us against all Nations; and having the Sea for the Wall, mutual Love for Garison, and GOD for Defence, should make so Noble and well agreeing Monarchy, that neither in Peace we may be ashamed, nor in War afraid of any Worldly or Foreign Power: Why should not you be as desireous of the same, and have as much Cause to rejoyce at it as we?—And for a more sure Proof and plainer Token of the good Mind and Will which we bear unto you, that which never yet was granted to <HI>Scotland</HI> in any League, Truce or Peace betwixt <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland;</HI> because ye shall have Proof of the beginning of Love and Amity of both the Realms, the King's Highness considering the mul∣titude of them which are come to His Majesty's Devotion, and of them that be Well-willers and Aiders of this Godly Enterprize, hath by our Advice and Counsel granted, and by these presents doth grant, that from hence-forth all manner of Merchants and other <HI>Scotsmen,</HI> who will enter their Names with one of the Wardens of the Marches, and there profess to take part with us, in this before named godly purpose, may lawfully, and without any Trouble and Vexation, enter into any Port, Creek or Haven of <HI>England,</HI> and there use their Traffick of Merchandize, buy and sell, bring in the Commodities of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and take and carry forth the Commodities of <HI>England,</HI> as liberally and as freely, and with the same and none other Customs therefore, than <HI>Englishmen,</HI> and the King's Subjects do at this present. <BIBL><HI>Holinshed, History of</HI> England, Vol. III. p. 998.</BIBL></Q></P>

<P><Q REND="inline"><P>THE Commissioners being met at <HI>Westminster,</HI> the chief Things debat∣ed on were, 1. Whether the two Kingdoms should be united un∣der the Name of <HI>Great-Britain.</HI> And 2. Whether both Nations should be equally capable of Honours and Offices in either Kingdom. Some advanc'd against the First, That it was without all Example, that two Kingdoms equally supreme, should lay aside their former Names for a third new One: Nor could the Name of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> be so Honour∣able as the several Names and Pluralities of Kingdoms: Thus tho <HI>Castile, Leon</HI> and <HI>Arragon,</HI> be united under the Subjection of the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> and <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Navarr</HI> under the <HI>French;</HI> yet these Kings alwise in their Designations mention the several Kingdoms they command.</P>
<P>Others alledg'd this ruight prejudice the Precedency of the Kings of <HI>England</HI> among other Princes; as being but a new one. But for all that, we find in History, that this is no new thing; and in particular <HI>Livy</HI> reports, That the <HI>Trojans</HI> and <HI>Aborigines</HI> did after the Union of their Nations as∣sume the common Name of <HI>Latines:</HI> Thus the <HI>Hungarians</HI> derived their Name from the <HI>Huni &amp; Avari (Morden in his Geography mentions the Au∣thors from whence we have it)</HI> The <HI>Catalonians</HI> from the <HI>Catti &amp; Albani:</HI> The Counties in <HI>Germany</HI> use that common Name: And that only is called <HI>Feudum novum</HI> which is acquired by Money, Donation or Conquest, and that <HI>Feudum antiquum</HI> which descends by Blood and Succession.</P>
<P>When the 2<HI>d</HI> question came under debate, some of the Commissioners agreed, it was unreasonable the <HI>Scots</HI> should be admitted to, and made capable of all the Employments in <HI>England.</HI> To this it was answered, That to refuse it would continue the ancient Grudge and Enmity, for the <HI>Romans</HI> were ne∣ver engaged in a sharper War, than in the <HI>Bellum sociale,</HI> which the <HI>La∣tines</HI> raised against them, because they would not admit them to be Con∣suls after they were united, (<HI>vide Livy, Plutarch, Florus,</HI> &amp;c.) After which the <HI>Romans</HI> did by their own Law Declare, That <HI>inter Concives &amp; Muni∣cipes, omnia munera debent esse communicata. Municipes enim sunt qui pari∣ter minera publica suscipiunt.</HI> And <HI>Polybins</HI> in <HI>Lib.</HI> 2. speaking of the Method whereby the <HI>Achaeans</HI> establish'd their happy Union, (read also <HI>Plutarch</HI>) observes it to have been by this means.</P>
<P>This Privilege has been allowed the <HI>Scots</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> for the Earl of <HI>Bu∣chan</HI> was made Constable by <HI>Ch.</HI> the 7th, because he defeated the Duke of <HI>Charence: Douglass</HI> was made Duke of <HI>Turaine; Aubigney Vice Roy</HI> of <HI>Naples.</HI> Count <HI>Lesly</HI> was preferred lately to be an Earl of the <HI>Empire,</HI> and still in the Emperial Dyets. In <HI>England William</HI> of <HI>Malmsbury</HI> confesses three <HI>Scots-Men</HI> were successively created Arch-Bishops of <HI>Tork,</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Forth</HI> was in the late Wars the successful General of the <HI>English</HI> Army.</P>
<P>King <HI>James</HI> thought this Debate encroach'd upon his Prerogative, and therefore desired it might go no further; That tho by his Prerogative he might imploy Natives of either Kingdom as he pleased, yet he would pre∣fer the Subjects of the respective Kingdoms in their native Countries, till mutual Education and a lasting Union had fitted them to be indifferently employ'd, upon which Assurance all the Commissioners rested, and so they proceeded to put these Conclusions in Form, and the Articles agreed upon were these.</P>
<P>It is agreed by the Commissioners of <HI>E.</HI> and S. to be mutually proposed to the Parliaments of both Realms at the next Session, that all
<PB N="105" REF="704"/>
Hostile Laws made and conceived expresly, either by <HI>E.</HI> against <HI>S.</HI> or <HI>S.</HI> against <HI>E.</HI> shall in the next Sessions be abrogated, and utterly extinguish∣ed.</P>
<P>It is also agreed, That all Laws, Customs and Treaties of the Border betwixt <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland</HI> shall be declared by a general Act to be abrogated and obliterated: And that the Subjects on either Part shall be governed by the Laws and Statutes of the Kingdoms where they dwell, and the Name of the <HI>Borders</HI> extinguished.</P>
<P>And because by abolishing the Border-Laws and Customs, it may be doubted, that the Executions shall cease upon these Sentences that have heretofore been given by the opposite Officers of those Borders, upon Wrongs committed before the Death of the late Queen of happy Memo∣ry; It is therefore thought fit, That in case the Commissioners or Officers to be appointed by His Majesty before the time of the next Sessions of Par∣liament, shall not procure sufficient Redress of such fyled Bills &amp; Sentences, that then the said Parliament may be moved to take such Order, as to their Wisdoms shall seem convenient in satisfaction of that which has been decerned by some Officers. As also, how Disorders and Insolencies may be hereafter repressed, and the Country which was lately of the Borders kept in Peace and Quietness in time to come; As likewise to prescribe some Orders how the Pursuits of former Wrongs preceeding the Death of the late Queen, and since the last Treaty of the Borders in the years 1596, and 1597, which have never as yet been moved, may be continued, and pro∣secuted to a definitive Sentence.</P>
<P>And forasmuch as the next Degree to the Abolition of all Memory of Hostility, is the Participation of mutual Commodities and Commerce; It is agreed First, concerning Importation of Merchandize into either Re∣alm from Foreign Parts; That whereas certain Commodities are wholly prohibited by the several Laws of both Realms to be brought into either of them by the Natives themselves, or by any other, the said Prohibitions shall now be made mutual to both, and neither an <HI>English-man</HI> bring into <HI>Scotland,</HI> or a <HI>Scots-man</HI> into <HI>England</HI> any of these prohibited Wares and Commodities: Nevertheless if the said Commodities be made in <HI>Scotland,</HI> it shall be lawful to bring them out of <HI>Scotland</HI> to <HI>England,</HI> and so recipro∣cally of the Commodities made in <HI>England</HI> and carried to <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>Whereas a doubt hath been conceived against the equal Communication of Trade betwixt the <HI>English &amp; Scots</HI> Subjects in the matter of Importation, grounded upon some Inequality of Privileges, which the <HI>Scots</HI> are report∣ed to have in Foreign Parts, and namely in <HI>France,</HI> above the <HI>English,</HI> whereby the <HI>English</HI> might be prejudged: And that after a deliberate Con∣sideration had of the supposed Inequalities, both private and publick Exa∣mination of divers Merchants of either side, touching all Liberties, Pri∣vileges, Immunities, Imposts and Payments on the part of the <HI>English,</HI> and on the part of the <HI>Scots,</HI> either at <HI>Bourdeaux</HI> for their Trade of Wines, or in <HI>Normandy</HI> or any other parts of <HI>France</HI> for other Commodities, it appear∣ed that in the Trade of <HI>Bourdeaux,</HI> there was &amp; is so little difference in any advantage of Privileges or Immunities, or in the Imposts and Payments, all being reckoned and well weighed on either side, as it could not justly hinder the Communication of Trade. In the Trade of <HI>Normandy</HI> likewise, or any other Parts of <HI>France,</HI> the advantage the <HI>Scots</HI> Subjects by their Privileges are acknowledged to have, is such as without much Difficulty may be reconciled and reduced to an Equality with the <HI>English,</HI> by such means as are hereafter declared. It is agreed that the <HI>Scots-men</HI> shall be
<PB N="106" REF="705"/>
free for transporting of Wine from <HI>Bourdeaux</HI> to <HI>England,</HI> paying the same Customs &amp; Duties that the <HI>English-men</HI> do pay, &amp; the <HI>English-men</HI> likewise shall be free for transporting Wine &amp; other Commodities from <HI>Bourdeaux</HI> to <HI>Scotland</HI> paying the same customs &amp; duties that the <HI>Scots-men</HI> do pay there.</P>
<P>And likewise for clearing and resolving the Doubts touching the Ad∣vantage that these <HI>Scots</HI> are supposed to have above the <HI>English</HI> in Buying and transporting the Commodities of <HI>Normandy</HI> and other parts of the King∣dom of <HI>France,</HI> excepting the buying of Wine in <HI>Bourdeaux,</HI> which is al∣ready determined. It is agreed, that there shall be sent some meet and discreet Persons into <HI>France,</HI> two for either side, to take notice of any such Advantage, as either the <HI>English</HI> have above the <HI>Scots,</HI> or the <HI>Scots</HI> above the <HI>English,</HI> in Buying or Transporting of any Commodities of <HI>Normandy,</HI> or any parts of <HI>France,</HI> excepting the Wine of <HI>Bourdeaux:</HI> And as the said Persons shall find the advantage to be, so for making the Trade e∣qual, the Customs shall be advanced to the King in <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland;</HI> And for the part of these that have the advantage, and according to the Proportion of the said Advantage, the Advancement of the Custom to continue no longer, than the Privilege having such advan∣tage shall continue. And that generally for all other Trade from any Parts the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Scots</HI> Subjects, each in others Countrey, shall have Liberty of Importation as freely as any of the Native Subjects themselves having special Privilege.</P>
<P>Next, Concerning Exportation, It is agreed, That all such Goods as are prohibited and forbidden to <HI>English-men</HI> themselves to be exported out of <HI>England</HI> to any Foreign Part, the same shall be unlawful for any <HI>Scots-man,</HI> or any other to export to any Foreign Nation beyond Sea, under the same Penalties and Forfeitures that the <HI>English</HI> are subject un∣to, and reciprocally that furth of <HI>Scotland</HI> no <HI>English</HI> Man shall transport to any Foreign Parts the Goods and Commodities that are pro∣hibited in <HI>Scotland</HI> to <HI>Scots</HI> Men themselves. Nevertheless such Goods and Commodities and Merchandizes as are licensed to <HI>English</HI> Men to transport out of <HI>England</HI> to any Foreign Part, the same may be likewise transported by <HI>Scots</HI> Men thither, they certifying their going into For∣reign Parts, and taking a Cocquet accordingly, and paying the ordinary Custom that <HI>English</HI> Men do pay themselves at the Exportation of such Wares, the like Liberty to be for <HI>English</HI> Men in <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>As for the Native Commodities which either of the Countries do yield, and may serve for the use and benefit of the other; It is agreed, That mutually there may be transported furth of E. to S. and furth of S. to E. all such Wares as are either of the Growth or Handywork of either of the said Realms, without payment of any Impost, Custom or Exaction; and as freely in all respects as any Wares may be transported either in <HI>En∣gland</HI> from part to part, or in <HI>Scotland</HI> from Part to Part, except such particular Sorts of Goods and Merchandizes as are hereafter mentioned, being restrain'd for the proper and inward use of each Countrey. And for that purpose it is declared, That both in this Communication of Bene∣fit, and Participation of the native Commodities of the one Countrey with the other, there shall be specially reserv'd and excepted the sorts hereaf∣ter specified; That is to say, Wooll, Sheep, Sheepfell, Cattel, Leather, Hides, and Linen-yarn, which are specially restrain'd within each Coun∣trey, not to be transported from one to the other; excepting also and re∣serving to the <HI>Scots</HI> Men their Trade of Fishing within the Lochs, Firths and Bayes, within Land, and in the Seas within 14 Miles of the Coasts of the Realm of <HI>Scotland,</HI> where neither <HI>English-</HI>men nor any Strangers have
<PB N="107" REF="706"/>
us'd to Fish; and so reciprocally on the behalf of <HI>England.</HI> All which Restrictions and Exceptions are not to be understood or mentioned in any sort for a Mark or Note of Separation and Division, but only as matters of Policy and Conveniency for the several Estates of each Countrey.</P>
<P>Furthermore it is agreed, That all foreign Wares to be transported forth of <HI>Scotland</HI> into <HI>England,</HI> or out of <HI>England</HI> into <HI>Scotland,</HI> by any of the King's Subjects of either Kingdoms, having at their first Entry once paid Custom in either of the Kingdoms, shall not pay outward Customs therein afterwards, save only inward Custom at the Port whereunto they shall be transported: But the Owner of the Goods, or Factor, or Master of the Ship shall give Bond not to transport the same into any foreign Parts.</P>
<P>It is also agreed, That <HI>Scots-</HI>men shall not be debarred from being As∣sociates unto any <HI>English</HI> Company of Merchants, as Merchant-Venturers or others upon such Conditions as any <HI>English-</HI>man may be admitted; and so reciprocally for <HI>English</HI> men in <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>It is nevertheless agreed by mutual Consent, and is so to be understood, that the mutual Liberty aforesaid of Exportation and Trade in each part from the one to the other, shall serve for the inward use only of either Re∣ahn; and Order taken for the restraining and prohibiting the Transpor∣tation of the said Commodities to foreign Parts, and for due Punishment of those that shall transgress in that behalf. And for the Better. Assu∣rance and Caution herein, It is agreed that every Merchant so offending shall forfeit his Goods, the Ships wherein the said Goods shall be trans∣ported, confiscated; the Customers, Searchers, and other Officers of the Custom whatsoever, in case of Consent or knowledge on their part, to lose their Offices and Goods, and their Bodies to be imprisoned at His Maje∣sty's pleasure. Of which Escheats and Forfeitures two Parts shall apper∣tain to His Majesty, if the Customs be unfarm'd, and the Third to the In∣former: And if the Customs be farmed, one Third of the Forfeiture to belong to His Majesty, a Third to the Farmer, and the other Third to the In∣former. The Tryal of the Offence to be summar in either Countrey in the Exchequer Chamber; by Writ, sufficient Witnesses, or Oath of Party, or before the Justice by Jury or Assize, and his Majesty's Officers in either Countrey to concur with the Complainers that insist in the Pursuit.</P>
<P>As also for the more Security that there shall be no Transportation of such Goods, it is agreed that at the shipping of all such native Com∣modities there be taken by the Customer of the Port where the Goods or Wares are embark'd a Bond or Obligation subscribed by the Owner of the Goods, and Master of the Ship; By the Owner if he be present, or by the Master of the Ship, or Factor, or Party that loadeth the same in case of his absence: Which Bond shall contain a Sum of Money answerable to the Value of the Goods, with condition of relieving the Party obliged, and discharging him of the said Bond in case Return be made of a due Cer∣tificate to the Custom where the Goods were laden, from any Port within <HI>England</HI> or <HI>Scotland,</HI> and the Certificate to be subscribed and sealed by the Officers of the Customs of the Port where the said Goods shall arrive to be unladen: Or if there be no such Officers there, by the chief Magi∣strate and Town Clerk of that Harbour and Town under their Hand and Seal. And it is further agreed touching the different Fraighting of Com∣modities either in <HI>English</HI> or <HI>Scots</HI> Bottoms, that <HI>English-</HI>men and <HI>Scots</HI> men fraight and laden their Goods each in others Ships &amp; Bottoms indiffe∣rently, paying only <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Scots</HI> Custom, notwithstanding any contra∣ry Laws or Prohibitions. And that a Proposition be made to the Parlia∣ment of <HI>England</HI> for establishing some good Orders, for upholding and maintaining the great Fishing of <HI>England;</HI> as also that a Proposition be
<PB N="108" REF="707"/>
made to the Parliament of <HI>Scotland</HI> for making of their shipping more proportionable in Burthen to the shipping of <HI>England,</HI> the better to serve for the Equality of Trade, and a common Defence for the whole Isle.</P>
<P>And because it's Requisite that the mutual Communication aforesaid, be not only extended to the Matter of Commerce, but to all other Benefites and Privileges of natural born Subjects; It is agreed that an Act be pro∣poned to be passed in Manner following: That all the Subjects of both Re∣alms born since the Decease of the late Queen, and that shal be born here∣after under the Obedience of His Majesty or His Royal Progeny, are by the common Laws of both Realms, and shall be for ever enabled to ob∣tain, succeed, inherit and possess all Goods, Lands and Chattels, Honours, Dignities, Offices, Liberties &amp; Privileges &amp; Benefices Ecclesiastick or Civil, in Parliament and all other places of the Kingdoms, and every one of the same, in all respects, and without any Exception whatsomever, as fully and amply as the Subjects of either Realm respectively might have done, or may do in any sort within the Kingdom where they are born.</P>
<P>Further, his Majesty out of his great Judgment and Providence, hath not only professed in publick and private Speech to the Nobility and Council of both Kingdoms, but hath also vouchsafed to be contented that for a more full Satisfaction and Comfort of all his loving Subjects, it may be compris'd in the said Act, that his Majesty meaneth not to confer any Office of the Crown, any Office of Judicature, Place, Voice or Office in Parliament of either Kingdom, upon the Subjects of the other, born be∣fore the death of the late Queen, until Time and Conversation have en∣creas'd and accomplish'd an Union of the said Kingdoms, as well in the Hearts of all the People, and in the Conformity of Laws and Policies in these Kingdoms, as in the Knowledge and Sufficiency of particular men, who being untimely imployed in such Authorities, could no way be able, much less acceptable, to discharge such Duties belonging to them. It is therefore resolved by us the Commissioners aforesaid, not only in regard of our Desires and Endeavours to further a speedy Conclusion of this hap∣py Work intended, but also as a Testimony of our Love and Thankful∣ness for his gracious Promise, on whose Sincerity and Benignity we build our full Assurance, even according to the inward sense and feeling of our own Loyal and Hearty Affections, to obey and please him in all things worthy the Subjects of so worthy a Sovereign, that it shall be desired of both the Parliaments, to be enacted by their Authority, That all the Sub∣jects of both Realms, born before the Decease of the late Queen, may be ena∣bled and made capable to acquire, purchase, inherit, succeed, use &amp; dispose of all Lands, Goods, Inheritances, Offices, Honours, Dignities Liberties, Privileges Immunities, Benefices and Preferments whatsoever, Each Subject in either Kingdom with the same freedom and as lawfully and peaceably as the ve∣ry natural and born Subjects of either Realm, where the said Rights, Es∣tates or Profits are Established; Notwithstanding whatsoever Law, Sta∣tute, or former Constitution heretofore in Force to the contrary; Other than to acquire, possess succeed or inherit any Office of the Crown, office of Judicatory, or any Voice, place or Office in Parliament. All which shall remain free from being claim'd, held or enjoy'd by the Subjects of the one Kingdom within the other, born before the decease of the late Queen, notwithstanding any Words, Sense or Interpretation of the Act, or any Cir∣cumstance thereupon depending, untill there be a perfect &amp; full Accomplish∣ment of the Union, as is desired mutually by both the Realms. In all which points of Reservation, either in Recital of the words, His Majesties sacred Promise, or in any Clause or Sentence, before specified, from enabling
<PB N="109" REF="708"/>
them to any of the foresaid Places or Dignities. It hath been &amp; ever shall be so far from the thoughts of any of us, to presume to alter or impair His Ma∣jestys Prerogative Royal (who contrariwise do with all comfort &amp; confidence depend herein, upon the gracious Assurance which his Majesty is pleas'd to give in the Declaration of his so just and Princely Care and Favour to all his People,) as for a further laying open of our clear &amp; dutiful Inten∣tions towards His Majestie in this &amp; in all things else which may concern his Prerogative: We do also herein profess &amp; declare, that We think it fit, there be inserted in the Act to be proponed and passed in express terms, a sufficient Reservation of his Majesties Prerogative Royal, to denizate, enable, and prefer to such Offices, Honours, Dignities, and Benefices whatsoever in both the said Kingdoms, and either of them, as are here∣tofore excepted in the preceeding Reservation of all <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Scots</HI> Sub∣jects born before the Decease of the late Queen, as freely, soveraignly and absolutely as any of His Majesties Royal Progenitors Kings of <HI>En∣gland</HI> or <HI>Scotland,</HI> might have done at any time heretofore, and to all o∣ther Intents and Purposes, in as ample manner as if no such Act had been thought of or mentioned.</P>
<P>And forasmuch as the several Jurisdictions and Administrations of either Realm may be abused by Malefactors, by their own Impunity, if they shall commit any Offence in the one Realm, and afterwards remove their Persons and Abode into the other; It is agreed, that there may be some fit Course advised of by the Wisdoms of the Parliaments, for Tryal and proceeding against the Persons of Offenders remaining in the one Realm, for and concerning the Crimes and Faults committed in the other Realm. And yet nevertheless that it may be lawful for the Justice of the Realm, where the Offence is committed, to remand the Offender remaining in the other Realm, to be answerable to the Justice of the same Realm where the Fact was committed, &amp; that upon such Remand made, the Offen∣der shall be accordingly delivered, and all further Proceedings (if any be) in the other Realm shall cease, so as it may be done without pre∣judice to His Majesty, or other Lords in their Escheats and Forfeitures, with provision nevertheless that this be not thought necessary to be made for all Criminal Offences, but in special Cases only, as namely in the Cases of wilful Murther, falsifying of Moneys, and forging of Deeds, Instruments and Writings, and such other like Cases, as upon further Ad∣vice in the said Parliament may be thought fit to be added.</P></Q></P>

<HEAD>A Paper given in by the <HI>Scots</HI> Commissioners to the <HI>English</HI> Commissioners for adjusting the differences of Trade between the two Kingdoms, <DATE><HI>Jan.</HI> 21. 1667.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>WE the Commissioners of and for the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland,</HI> Nomi∣nated, and sufficiently Authorized by His Majesty, under His
<PB N="110" REF="709"/>
great Seal of that Kingdom; to Treat and Consult, as also to Conclude and Determine with your Lordships the Commissioners nominated by His Majesty for the Kingdom of <HI>England,</HI> of and concerning the Freedom and Liberty of Trade, between the two Kingdoms of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland,</HI> do represent, That whereas his Majesty's Subjects of <HI>Scotland</HI> be under the Alledgeance of the King since the happy Succession of K. <HI>James</HI> to the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> are so far from being <HI>Aliens,</HI> that they are declared to have by the Law of this Kingdom all the Privileges of natural born Subjects of <HI>England.</HI> And whereas His Majesties Subjects in <HI>Scotland</HI> have enjoyed the same in all the Dominions and Plantations belonging to the Kingdom of <HI>England,</HI> more than 56 years without any considerable Ob∣struction all that time, yet since the 25 of <HI>March</HI> in the 12 year of His Ma∣jesties Reign, by some Acts of Parliament here in <HI>England,</HI> the King's Subjects of <HI>Scotland</HI> are clearly debarred from the Privilege granted to all His Majesties other Subjects; Seing by these Acts several Immunities and Privileges granted to such Ships, as do truely and without Fraud be∣long only to the People of <HI>England</HI> or <HI>Ireland,</HI> Dominion of <HI>Wales,</HI> or Town of <HI>Berwick</HI> upon <HI>Tweed,</HI> and all other Ships and Vessels (without any Exception) with all their Goods and Merchandizes are declared to be forefaulted. Also by other Acts of Parliament since that time. Goods and Commodities of <HI>Scotland</HI> are at some times charged with a double Du∣ty or Imposition above 16 times more than the Goods of the like Nature of Foreign Growth, &amp; some unusual Customs are exacted in <HI>Northumberland</HI> &amp; <HI>Cumberland.</HI></P>
<P>In Order to the removing of all Obstructions, to the Freedom &amp; Liberty of Trade between the two Kingdoms, to the end the People of <HI>Scotland</HI> may be encouraged to trade here as formerly, and to export from the Kingdom such foreign and other Commodities as are necessary for them, (which we conceive to be a great advantage to this Kingdom, the expor∣ted Commodities far exceeding these imported hither) for encouraging the Shipping and Seamen of <HI>Scotland,</HI> without which Trade cannot be continued, and for preventing the Removal of the Trade of <HI>Scotland</HI> into foreign Parts, which would be very prejudicial to His Majesties Customs in this Kingdom (as we conceive) and to the happy Union and Cor∣respondence of the two Kingdoms, which we do above all things endea∣vour to preserve.</P>
<P>We do begin with that which was 1<HI>st</HI> in time, and indeed of the greatest Importance to <HI>Scotland,</HI> an Act Intituled <HI>(An Act for the incouraging and increasing Shipping and Navigation)</HI> passed in the 12 year of His Maje∣sty's Reign, and Ratified, Confirmed and Enacted in the 13 year. <HI>Cap.</HI> 140 In relation to which Act, we desire 1<HI>st.</HI> That as to the Trade with the Lands, Islands, Plantations and Territories to His Majesty belonging, or in his Possession, or which may thereafter belong unto, or be in the Possession of His Majesty, His Heirs or Successors, in <HI>Asia, Africa</HI> or <HI>A∣merica,</HI> the same Freedom may be allowed to such Ships and Vessels as do truely and without Fraud belong to the People of <HI>Scotland,</HI> whereof the Master &amp; three 4th Parts are <HI>Scotsmen,</HI> or other His Majesties Subjects, and fraighted only by His Majesties Subjects; as are allowed to His Majesties Subjects of <HI>Ireland,</HI> Dominion of <HI>Wales</HI> and <HI>Berwick</HI> upon <HI>Tweed.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. That it be Declared, That His Majesties Subjects of <HI>Scotland</HI> are not meaned to be debarred by the Clause debarring Men or Persons, not born within the Alledgeance of our Sovereign Lord the King, from exercising the Trade or Occupation of Merchants or Factors in any of the saids Places.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="111" REF="710"/>
3. That the Ships or Vessels belonging truly to His Majesties Subjects of <HI>Scotland,</HI> navigated as is before expressed, and fraighted only by His Majesties Subjects, may be declared to have Liberty to bring into <HI>England</HI> the Goods and Commodities that are of Foreign Growth, Production, or Manufactory, under the same Restrictions and Limitations as are exprest e∣ver since King <HI>James</HI> came to <HI>England,</HI> is of absolute necessity for entertain∣ing the Shipping of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and keeping the samen there for His Maje∣sties Service, and will be an encrease of His Majesties Customs.</P>
<P N="4">4. That all other Privileges granted by this Act to the Ships and Ves∣sels belonging truly to the Subjects of <HI>Ireland, Wales,</HI> and Town of <HI>Ber∣wick</HI> upon <HI>Tweed,</HI> may be also declared to belong to the Ships or Vessels truly belonging to the Subjects of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and Navigated &amp; Fraighted as is aforesaid, under the same Restrictions and Limitations alwise as by this Act laid upon the Subjects of <HI>Ireland, &amp;c.</HI> That it may be declared that the Penalties imposed upon <HI>Aliens</HI> for transporting of Goods from Ports to Ports, and all other Penalties imposed upon <HI>Aliens</HI> by this Act, that the Subjects of <HI>Scotland</HI> are no ways therein concerned.</P>
<P N="5">5. That whereas almost all the Ships and Vessels belonging to His Ma∣jesties Subjects of <HI>Scotland,</HI> were during the late Usurpation taken, burnt or Destroyed, and many of the Vessels taken or bought since His Majesties happy Return, are foreign built; we desire that all Vessels taken from the Kings Enemies, and condemned as lawful Prize, may be Declared Na∣turalized, as is lately done here, and that they and all such Ships as are truly in the Possession of His Majesties Subjects of <HI>Scotland,</HI> may be de∣clared capable of free Trade here as if they had been built within His Majesties Dominions; a List of such Ships being entred betwixt and a day to be agreed upon into the Custom-house Books here, Provided that it shall not be lawful for <HI>Scots-men</HI> to trade here with any foreign built Ships to be bought hereafter, but only with such Ships as are built in <HI>Scot∣land,</HI> or some other of His Majesties Dominions, and that both the Prize-Ships and other Ships now in the possession of the Subjects of <HI>Scotland,</HI> be navigated by 3 Parts of 4 of <HI>Scots-men,</HI> or others His Majesties Subjects, and fraighted only by His Majesties Subjects.</P>
<P N="6">6. And whereas it may be supposed, that by demanding such a Trade with the Plantations, as is allowed to the Subjects of <HI>Ireland,</HI> we may pre∣judge His Majesties Customs here, or destroy the Ends of the Act of Na∣vigation as to these Commodities; We Declare that we are willing to Treat and Conclude with your Lordships upon such Assurances as can be reasonably demanded, that none of these Commodities shall be transport∣ed by <HI>Scots</HI> Ships from the <HI>English</HI> Plantations to any place beyond the Seas, but they shall be wholly brought into such Parts of <HI>England</HI> as shall be agreed upon, excepting only such a very small Number, for the Con∣sumption of <HI>Scotland,</HI> as shall be agreed upon betwixt your Lordships and us.</P>

<P>ABout 7 in the Evening the Commissioners of both Kingdoms meet at the Place appointed for their Meeting, the <HI>English</HI> Commissioners being first there: After they had stood a while, they took their Places at a long Table, the <HI>English</HI> on the Right side, and the Arch-Bishop of <HI>Canterbury</HI> as first in their Commission upmost. And the <HI>Scots</HI> on the left Side, and the Duke of <HI>Queensberry</HI> first in the Commission upmost. When they were set, the Lord Keeper moved, That their respective Commissions should be read, by which they would best know the Reasons of their Meet∣ing, which was done, the <HI>English</HI> first in the <HI>English</HI> Tongue, and the <HI>Scots</HI> in the <HI>Latine:</HI> when that was over, the Lord Keeper made the following Speech, which was answered by the Duke of <HI>Queensberry.</HI><Q><P><HI>My Lords,</HI></P>
<P>WE, the Commissioners, for <HI>England,</HI> do, with great Satisfaction meet your Lordships on this Occasion, hoping that by this Con∣gress the great Business for which Her Majesty has been pleased to grant these Commissions, may be happily effected. That <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scot∣land</HI> already united in Alledgeance under one Head, the Queen, may for ever hereafter become one People, one in Heart and mutual Affec∣tions, one in Interest, one in Name, or in Deed, a Work which if it can be brought to pass, promiseth a lasting Happiness to us all.</P>
<P>With great Sincerity we desire this Union, and we meet your Lord∣ships with Hearts fully determined to enter upon such Considerations, and into such Measures with your Lordships, as are proper for bring∣ing the same to the desired Conclusion; on our part nothing shall be want∣ing that may conduce to a happy Period of this great Work.</P></Q></P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Queensberrie</HI>'s Answer.<Q><P><HI>My Lord,</HI></P>
<P>THE Union of the two Kingdoms has been much desired both before and since their being under one Sovereign, and I hope, it is re∣served to Her Majesty for the Glory of Her Reign, to finish the design which hath been often attempted by Her Royal Predecessors.</P>
<P>My Lord, I do consider this Union to be highly advantageous for the Peace and Wealth of both Kingdoms, and a great Security for the Pro∣testant Religion every-where; And, I can assure your Lordships both for my self, and the other Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland,</HI> that we meet your Lordships with great Regard and Honour to your Persons, and with sincere Intentions to advance this great Design, &amp; to accom∣modate any Difficulties that may arise in the Treaty upon fair and rea∣sonable Terms.</P></Q></P>
<P>Then the Lord Keeper moved, That some Words of the <HI>Scots</HI> Com∣mission should be read over again, which was done, the Words they no∣ticed were, <HI>Dando illis plenam potestatem congregandi &amp; conveniendi cum Commissionariis authoritate nostra munitis pro Regno &amp; Parliamento Angliae,</HI>

<HI>&amp;c.</HI> After reading, he said, he did not conceive how they were such as the <HI>Scots</HI> were impowered to Treat with, not being <HI>Commissionarii pro Par∣liamento Angliae;</HI> Before any Answer was made, the Earl of <HI>Seafield</HI> mo∣ved, That the Commissions should be interchanged against the next Meet∣ing, and that then they would be better, able to judge of the Purport and Intent of the Commissions, which was agreed to, and the next Meeting appointed on <HI>Monday</HI> thereafter.</P>

<P>HER Majesty having in Prosecution of the several Attempts made by Her Royal Predecessors, moved both the Parliaments to consider of the most effectual Methods for establishing an Union be∣tween the two Kingdoms; And Her Majesty being authorized by both Parliaments to Appoint Commissioners to Treat of the Terms of this Union, which She hath done accordingly, Her Majesty hopeth that the Commissioners now happily met for this purpose, will agree upon such Measures as will be acceptable to both Parliaments; and may perfect an indissoluble Union between the two Nations, which Her Majesty thinks the most likely Means under Heaven to establish the Monarchy, secure the Peace, and encrease the Trade, Wealth and Happiness of both Nations.</P>
<P>The Heads of this Treaty are so obvious, that Her Majesty does not think it necessary to Name them, but Her Majesty recommends it to the Commissioners, to make such Proposals mutually on this Subject, as shall occur to them, and may be most likely to bring this Treaty to a happy and speedy Conclusion.</P>
<P>And Her Majesty earnestly wishes for Her own Honour, and the Welfare of Her Subjects, That this Union may be established on such solid Foundations, as that the Breach of it may be as impossible as humane Councils can make it.

<P>The Lords Commissioners for <HI>England,</HI> have taken into their Conside∣ration two of the three Articles offered by your Lordships on the part of <HI>Scotland, viz.</HI> 1.

<P>My Lord Duke of <HI>Quensberry</HI> Moved, That since they had given their Lordships a full Answer to the Proposals offered by them at their preceed∣ing Meeting, and have only received their Lordships Answer to two of the Three Articles proposed by them, that nothing should be entred by the Secretarys in their Books till they have an answer to their Third <HI>Ar∣ticle, about the Communication of Trade,</HI> which was agreed to:</P>

<P>THE Commissioners being met, the Duke of <HI>Queensberry</HI> said, That the Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> had some thing to offer to their Lordships, in reference to their Lordships Answer to the 3<HI>d</HI> Article about Communication of Trade, which was read as follows.</P>
<P>The Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> having taken into Consideration your Lordships Answer to the 3<HI>d</HI> Article of their Proposals, wherein your Lordships agree. That a mutual Communication of Trade and other Priviledtes and Advantages is proper and reasonable in a compleat Union of the two Kingdoms, their Lordships conceive that the uniting the two Kingdoms into a Monarchy, in one Parliament, and one Line of Succes∣sion, is such an Union as Entitle the Subjects of both Kingdoms to a mu∣tual Communication of Trade, and other Privileges and Advantages, and if your Lordships do acquiesce and consent to the Communication of Trade in these Terms, the Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> do consent that the Answer and this Addition be entred in the respective Books and Journals.</P>
<P>The Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> withdrew to consider this, and returning within a little, the Lord Keeper offered what follows, which was read.</P>
<P>Their Lordships conceive that the Union cannot be compleat till the Terms are adjusted, upon which it is to be constituted, and therefore tho they allow the Communication of Trade and other Privileges to be the necessary Result of a compleat Union: yet in the Method of proceeding they must first settle with your Lordships the Terms and Conditions of the Communication of Trade and other Privileges, and they are ready to enter upon the Consideration of them in such a Method as shall be agree∣ed on, and most likely to bring this particular Matter to a speedy De∣termination.</P>
<P>They move, That their Answer to the Proposal from the Commissioners of <HI>England,</HI> which relates to the uniting the two Kingdoms into one, and settling the Succession, may be entred.</P>
<P>To this the Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> after having withdrawn for some time, and returned, made the following Answer, which was read, and agreed to by the <HI>English</HI> Commissioners.</P>
<P>The Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> are satisfied to treat the Particu∣lars of the Communication of Trade, in order to adjust the same, and do agree that the Proposals and Answers mutually made on either side be entred in the respective Books and Journals in the terms of the Prelimi∣naries.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="718"/>
Then the Duke of <HI>Queensberry</HI> offered on the part of the Lords Com∣missioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> the following Proposals, which was read, and agre∣ed to by the <HI>English</HI> without withdrawing.</P>
<P>The Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> propose to your Lordships, That for preparing and facilitating Matters which may occur in this Treaty, there may be a Committee consisting of 4 or 5 Persons of either King∣dom Nominate from time to time, to meet and discourse the Points that may properly fall in to be considered in this Treaty, and to report what hath past to the respective Commissioners, that in the General Meet∣ing they may proceed with the greater Unanimity and Dispatch.</P>

<P>The Lord Keeper told Her Majesty, That what was then under Consi∣deration, was, some Proposals offered on the part of their Lordships for <HI>Scotland</HI> about Trade, to which they had not yet prepared an Answer, but desired to know if Her Majesty would hear read the Proposals for∣merly given on either Side, and the Resolutions taken thereupon, which Her Majesty allowed.</P>
<P>After reading whereof, Her Majesty went away, and the Commissio∣ners adjourned to the 16th Instant.</P>

<P>THE Commissioners met, and the Lord Keeper in name of the <HI>English</HI> Commissioners gave in the following Paper to the Lords Commissio∣ners for <HI>Scotland,</HI> which was read, as follows.</P>
<P>Some Considerations of the Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> upon the
<PB N="121" REF="720"/>
Proposals delivered by the Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> on the 9th instant, to be proposed as the Subject Matter of Debate between the Lords Commissioners of both Kingdoms.</P>
<P>As to the First Article, Their Lordships are of Opinion that there be a free Trade between the two Kingdoms, for the Native Commodities of the Growth, Product or Manufactory of the respective Countries, with an Exception of Wooll, Sheep and Sheep Fells, and without any Distincti∣on or Imposition other than equal Duties upon the home Consumption re∣spectively: Their Lordships being of Opinion, that the Trade between the two Kingdoms cannot be upon an equal Foot, unless the said Duties and Impositions be the same in <HI>Scotland</HI> as in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>And this Article respecting a Coast-Trade, it seems reasonable for their Lordships to insist, That the Master, Mariner and Goods should be un∣der the same Securities, Penalties and Regulations, as are in that case provided by the Laws in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>As to the 2<HI>d</HI> Article, it seems reasonable; But their Lordships offer, that it will be necessary therein to add a Provision, That not only the Im∣positions on Trade, but the Prohibitions be the same on both Sides, in re∣spect as well of Importations as Exportations.</P>
<P>As to the 3<HI>d</HI> Article, Their Lordships say, That the Plantations are the Property of <HI>English</HI> Men, and that this Trade is of so great a Consequence, and so beneficial, as not to be communicated, as is proposed till all other Particulars which shall be thought necessary to this Union be adjusted; And as the Case now stands by Law, no <HI>European</HI> Goods can be carried to the <HI>English</HI> Plantations, but what have been first landed in <HI>England,</HI> ex∣cept Salt, <HI>Irish</HI> and <HI>Scots</HI> Provisions, Servants and Horses, <HI>Madera</HI> Wine, and Wine of the <HI>Azores;</HI> nor can the Product of the Plantations be carryed to other Parts of <HI>Europe</HI> till it be first landed in <HI>England.</HI> Their Lordships further offer, That in this Article, it will be necessary to make Provision, that the Subjects of <HI>Scotland</HI> shall be lyable to be pressed for the Sea, in the same manner as the <HI>English</HI> Subjects are in time of War for Her Maje∣sty's Service.</P>
<P>As to the 4<HI>th</HI> Article, Their Lordships agree that an Act of Navigation must be granted in both Kingdoms adapted to the Terms of the Union.</P>
<P>As to the 5<HI>th</HI> Article, their Lordships say, That the Proposals therein∣contained seems to contradict what was granted by the 2<HI>d</HI> Article, in as much as there is no Duty subsisting on Trade (excepting only on some Funds for the Civil Government) but what is appropriated to the pay∣ment of the Debts of the Nation; That tho the said Debts have been contracted by a long War entred into; More particularly for the Preser∣vation of <HI>England,</HI> and the Dominions thereto belonging; Yet that <HI>Scot∣land</HI> has tasted of the Benefites which have accrued to <HI>Great-Britain</HI> in general, from the Opposition that hath been made to the Growth and Power of <HI>France;</HI> That such Burdens will be abundantly recompensed to <HI>Scotland</HI> by a compleat Union: To which compleat Union as a free Communication of Trade is essential, so such a free Communication of Trade cannot be established with Equality, unless the same Duties both
<PB N="122" REF="721"/>
upon Foreign Trade and Home Consumption be levied on both King∣doms: But how the Sums of Money thereby arising within the said Re∣alm shall be applyed, or what Equivalent is to be allowed in the Room thereof, may be settled when your Lordships are ready to offer what Pro∣portion of the publick Burdens <HI>Scotland</HI> proposes to bear towards the fu∣ture Support of the Government both in times of Peace and War.</P>
<P>As to the 6<HI>th</HI> Article, their Lordships say, That it requires to be further explained, before they can be ready to give any answer to it.</P>
<P>After giving in the above Proposals, in answer to the last Proposal made by <HI>Scotland,</HI> the <HI>English</HI> desired a Day for a Conference on both might be appointed, which was accordingly appointed on <HI>Saturday</HI> next.</P>

<P>THE Commissioners on both Sides had a full Conference upon the Subject of the Communication of Trade in the foresaids Proposals and An∣swers, which was very amicable, and their Lordships for <HI>England</HI> agre∣ed to all the Proposals made by their Lordships for <HI>Scotland,</HI> and a Com∣mittee was appointed to draw up the Resolutions taken thereupon, to be offered at their next Meeting on <HI>Wednesday</HI> the 23 instant.</P>

<P>THE Commissioners met, and at their taking their Places, the Lord Keeper said, their Lordships of <HI>England</HI> had taken Notice of the publishing of some of their Proceedings in the Flying-Post, which they thought not Convenient, and therefore had ordered their Secretary not to give out any Copies of their Proceedings, and desired their Lordships for <HI>Scotland</HI> would do the like, which was agreed to. And then</P>
<P>The Lord Keeper offered a Paper, containing the Result of the last Con∣ference in the Proposals made by the Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> a∣bout Trade. And the Duke of <HI>Queensberry</HI> offered another, which were both read: The <HI>English</HI> in the following Terms.</P>
<P>Agreed by the Lords Commissioners of both Kingdoms in the terms of the Preliminaries, and to take effect when the Union shall be compleat∣ed.<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That there be a free Trade between all the Subjects of the Island of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> without any Distinction, in the same manner as is now practised from one part of <HI>England</HI> to another, and that the Masters, Ma∣riners, and Goods be under the same Securities and Penalties in the Coasting-Trade.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That both Kingdoms be under the same Regulations and Prohibi∣tions, and lyable to equal Impositions for Importation and Exportation, and upon the home Consumption, and that a Book of Rates be adjusted for both.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. That the Subjects of both Kingdoms, and their Seamen and Shipping, have equal Freedom of Trade and Commerce to and from the Plantations, under such and the same Regulations and Restrictions as are and will be necessary for preserving the said Trade of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and that the Seamen of <HI>Scotland</HI> be equally lyable to the publick Service, as the Sea∣men of <HI>England</HI> now are.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. That such Laws, Part or Parts of the Act of Navigation, or of any other Law now in force in either Kingdom, as shall be contrary to, or inconsistent with the Union, shall be on both sides repealed.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The Paper offered by the <HI>Scots</HI> differed only materially from this in that in the second Article, the Words (and upon the Home Consumpt) were left out, and so need not to be inserted.</P>
<P>After reading of which, the <HI>Scots</HI> Commissioners withdrew, and return∣ing within a little, the Duke of <HI>Queensberry</HI> told their Lordships for <HI>En∣gland,</HI> that they had taken notice of some things in the Paper offered by their Lordships, which did not seem properly to fall under the Head of Trade, as the Duties on Home Consumpt; The <HI>English</HI> insisted that it did. So it was moved that there should be a Conference on this Mat∣ter <HI>Saturday</HI> next.</P>

<ITEM>2.

<P>THere not being a <HI>Quorum</HI> of the <HI>English,</HI> and the <HI>Scots</HI> being met in their own Chamber in the <HI>Cock-pit;</HI> The Marquess of <HI>Normanbie</HI> and Earls of <HI>Pembroke</HI> and <HI>Notinghame</HI> came unto them from such of the <HI>En∣glish</HI> Commissioners as were met in the Council Chamber, to signifie that they were so much ashamed of the frequent Disappointments they had given them, That for preventing the like for the future, they had resolved amongst themselves to apply to Her Majesty for a new Commission under the Broad Seal, in which Seven might be named a <HI>Quorum.</HI></P>

<P>THE Commissioners being met, the <HI>English</HI> gave in a new Commission under the Broad-Seal of <HI>England,</HI> whereby Seven were appointed a <HI>Quorum;</HI> And the same being read, the Lord Keeper offered in Writ∣ing the following Considerations upon the Articles, in reference to Home Consumpt offered by their Lordships of <HI>Scotland</HI> on the 18th: Which Considerations being read, were by the <HI>Scots</HI> Commissioners taken into Consideration till next Meeting, which was appointed on the 27th instant, and a Conference appointed on the 26th instant.</P>
<P><LIST>
<HEAD>Follows the Considerations offered by the <HI>English.</HI></HEAD>
<ITEM>1. AS to the former part of the first Article, <HI>viz.</HI> That neither Kingdom be burdened with the Debts contracted, or to be contracted by the other before the Union, it being the same <HI>in terminis</HI> with the 5th Proposition delivered by your Lordships on the 9th <HI>December;</HI> the Ob∣servation made then may suffice for a Reply to it now, <HI>viz.</HI> That tho the Debts of <HI>England</HI> have been contracted by a long War, entred into more particularly for the Preservation of <HI>England,</HI> and the Dominions thereto belonging, yet <HI>Scotland</HI> has had its Share in the Benefits which
<PB N="127" REF="726"/>
have accrued to <HI>Great-Britain</HI> in general from the Opposition that has been made to the Growth and Power of <HI>France,</HI> and have encreased the Number of their Seamen considerably, by the Imployment they had in the Coast-Trade of <HI>England</HI> during the War. But as it is necessary they should be under equal Impositions with regard to the Ballance of Trade, and Manufactories when the Kingdoms shall be united, and a free Com∣munication of Native Product settled, so it may be reasonable that the Money so raised upon that part which is now called <HI>Scotland,</HI> should be applyed to the Security and Protection of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and the Trade thereof; nor does it follow, That because the Duties now raised on particular Funds in <HI>England</HI> are appropriate for payment of Debts; That therefore when the like Duties are laid on in <HI>Scotland,</HI> they must be applyed in the same manner, but for their Lordships to propose that there be no other Duty in <HI>Scotland</HI> than these now on Foot there, till the Debts in <HI>England</HI> con∣tracted, or to be contracted before the Union be fully satisfied and paid, setts the present Trade on an equal Foot, (which is intended by an equality of Impositions) at such a distance, as gives little hopes to any now alive of coming at it, For one of the nine Pences on Beer and Ale being the Fund of the first Million <HI>Act, Anno</HI> 4 and 5. of the late King and Queen, was granted for 99 years; One Nine Pences more (which is the Fund of the Lottery) for about eight years yet to come; One nine Pence more (which is the Bank-Fund) Inheritance to the Crown, as are also the several Duties upon Salt, and half that on Stamped Paper, tho' in these latter Duties there are Clauses of Provision for Redemption, but whilst it is insisted, That there shall be no other nor greater in <HI>Scotland</HI> than are already paid there, it may be presumed that these already men∣tioned, are enough to prevent the necessity of enquiring into the Number or Proportion of what they have in <HI>Scotland,</HI> where if by Exemption from such Duties, a Clothier can subsist himself at 4<HI>d per diem,</HI> whereas he cannot subsist in <HI>England</HI> under 8<HI>d per diem;</HI> Then all such Manufactu∣res who shall go thither; will be able to undersell, and consequently out∣trade those that stay in <HI>England</HI> half in half in what relates to their La∣bour, by subsisting so much cheaper; But the Workmanship of every pound of Wooll made in Cloth, advances the value of it near Nine Parts in Ten for its first Cost.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. As to the second Article, their Lordships say, That Duties upon the Home Consumption require to be equally laid on all the parts of the U∣nited Kingdoms; Nor do the Northern Counties of <HI>England</HI> pay less Duties of Excise (as seems here suggested) than the Mid-land, but rather more in Proportion to the value of their Counties and Commodities ex∣cised.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. As to the Third Article, it is needless to debate upon it till the first be settled, these two depending the one upon the other; If indeed the Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> should think it expedient to exempt Home-Consumption of <HI>Scotland</HI> from any new Duties for some reasonable Period of Time, till that Kingdom began to reap the benefite of the free Com∣munication of Trade intended by the Union, Then their Lordships will insist, that such Commodities as pay Duties in <HI>England</HI> may be cleared with the same Duties when they are exported or brought out of <HI>Scotland</HI> into <HI>England,</HI> &amp; upon some other Provisions which will be requisite to pre∣vent Frauds in Her Majesties Revenues.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="128" REF="727"/>
4. As to the 4th Article, The Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> say, That the free Communication, especially of the Foreign Trade, to which in the terms of the Preliminaries their Lordships have assented, is so great a Benefite to <HI>Scotland,</HI> that they did not expect an Equivalent should have been mentioned, for the equality of Imposition on Importation and Ex∣portation; Besides, their Lordships say, your Lordships have already a∣greed upon an equality of Impositions as to Foreign Trade, both as to Ex∣portation and Importation.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. As to the 5th Article, It will be impossible to determine this Point till their Lordships shall be informed of the value of the Lands in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and this may be further debated when their Members or Representatives in the Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> shall be settled.</ITEM>

<P>THE Commissioners having met, the Lord President on the part of the Lords Commissioners for <HI>England,</HI> offered the following Paper, as their Lordships Sense of the Conference at the preceeding Meeting, which was read as follows.</P>
<P>The Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> agree, that neither Kingdom shall be burdened with the Debts of the other, contracted before the Union, and that no Duties on Home Consumption, or Taxes to be levyed from <HI>Scot∣land,</HI> shall be applyed for payment of the <HI>English</HI> Debts; and whatever time may be fit to be allowed to <HI>Scotland</HI> to reap the benefite of the Com∣munication of Trade, and enable them the better to pay Duties on Home Consumption equal to <HI>England,</HI> is most proper to be determined in the respective Parliaments of both Kingdoms.</P>
<P>Then his Lordship offered on the part of the Lords Commissioners for <HI>England</HI> an Answer to the Proposition made at the last Meeting by their Lordships of <HI>Scotland:</HI> Which was read as follows.</P>
<P>As to the last Proposition delivered the 27th Instant, their Lordships say, It has been found by Experience, That two Companies existing to∣gether in the same Kingdom, and carrying on the same Traffick, are de∣structive to Trade, and are therefore of Opinion, that to agree with this Proposition, will be inconsistent with the Interest of <HI>Great-Britain.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="728"/>
The Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> withdrew to consider these Pa∣pers, and returning to the Council Chamber, My Lord Duke of <HI>Queens∣berry</HI> acquainted their Lordships of <HI>England,</HI> That the Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> would consider their Lordships Answer to their Proposi∣tion about the Company against the next Meeting; That they had now prepared for their Lordships what they took to be their Sense of the Pa∣per they had received from their Lordships, which was read as follows.</P>
<P>The Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> understand the Paper given in by their Lordships in this Sense; That neither Kingdoms shall be bur∣dened with the Debts of the other contracted before the Union, and that no Duties on Home Consumption, or Taxes to be levyed from <HI>Scotland</HI> shall be applyed to the payment of <HI>English</HI> Debts, and that a Time be al∣lowed to <HI>Scotland</HI> to reap the Benefite of the Communication of Trade, be∣fore that Kingdom become lyable to pay other or greater Duties on Home Consumption, or Inland Taxes, than those now on Foot: And that it is most proper to be determined by the respective Parliaments of both Kingdoms how long that Time of Exemption shall subsist: This Paper their Lordships of <HI>England</HI> took into Consideration against next Meeting.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Queensberry</HI> moved, That since they were so near agree∣ing on this Matter, which was only the first of the Articles offered on the 18th Instant, that they should proceed to the Consideration of the o∣ther Articles.</P>
<P>And accordingly the 2<HI>d</HI> of the said Articles was read, and the Consi∣deration and Answers relative thereto were spoke to by the Lords Com∣missioners on both sides; But before coming to any Resolution, their Lordships adjourned to the 30th Instant.</P>

<P>The said Article was read, and the saids Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> ha∣ving withdrawn to consider the same, and returning to the Council-Chamber, My Lord Duke of <HI>Queensberry</HI> acquainted their Lordships of <HI>England,</HI> That the Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> had agreed to the Article as given in by their Lordships, understanding their Lordships Sense of the last Clause to be such, as that it relates to the Length of the Time to be allowed to <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ordered,</HI> That the said Article be insert in the Journals of this Day, as agreed on between the Lords Commissioners of both Kingdoms.</P>

<P>The Duke of <HI>Queensberry</HI> acquainted the Lords Commissioners for <HI>En∣gland,</HI> that their Lordships of <HI>Scotland</HI> having considered their Lordships Answer to their Proposition of the 27th of <HI>January,</HI> about the Company Trading to <HI>Africa</HI> and the <HI>Indies;</HI> They did offer to their Lordships the following Paper, which was read, and taken into Consideration by the Lords Commissioners for <HI>England,</HI> and is as follows.</P>
<P><LIST>
<HEAD>By the Lords Commissioners for <HI>Scotland.</HI></HEAD>
<ITEM>THeir Lordships do still insist for Preserving and Securing the Privi∣leges of the <HI>Scots</HI> Company trading to <HI>Africa</HI> and the <HI>Indies,</HI> Because the Undertakers did on the publick Faith of the Kingdom, advance a Stock of 200000 <HI>lib.</HI> or thereby; And it is not unknown to your Lordships, what part the Generality of the Kingdom, and also the Parliament of <HI>Scotland</HI> did take in the Discouragements and Disappointments the said Company did receive, as is fully expressed in the Address of the Parlia∣ment to the late King.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Their Lordships conceive, That the Privileges of the <HI>Scots</HI> Company may consist with the <HI>English</HI> East <HI>India</HI> Company, or any other <HI>English</HI> Company which are circumscribed to the present Limits of <HI>England;</HI> And it is not proposed that the Privileges of the <HI>Scots</HI> Company should be ex∣tended beyond the Bounds of <HI>Scotland,</HI> so the several Companies do not interfere.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. If the existing of Companies for carrying on the same Traffick, do appear to your Lordships destructive of Trade: It is not expected that your Lordships will insist, that therefore the Privileges of the <HI>Scots</HI> Com∣pany should be abandon'd, without offering at the same time to purchase their Right at the publick Expence.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>And then they adjourned to <HI>Wednesday</HI> the 3<HI>d</HI> Instant.</P>
