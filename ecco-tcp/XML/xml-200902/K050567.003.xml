<HEAD>CHAP. XLV. OF SHENSTONE-GREEN PLAY-HOUSE, PANTHEON, CONCERT-ROOM AND CORNELYS; WITH AN ACCOUNT OF THE MASTER OF THE CEREMONIES.</HEAD>
<P>BUT, while these little wounds of the heart were curing, there were others of a more dangerous and malignant nature, breeding in the constitution of <HI>Shenstone-Green.</HI></P>
<P>No sooner had I given my per∣mission, or, more properly speaking, no sooner had the ladies drawn from me my "slow leave," to establish
<PB N="2" REF="8"/>their projects of amusement, than the greatest vigour was employed to dis∣patch the execution. By which means, the village was again covered with confusion. The ardour of the female association was, indeed, so intense, that every scheme was begun at the same time, and, upon going into the <HI>Green,</HI> a few months after the first fatal idea was started, I had the misery to behold the sudden growth of evils, very remarkably illustrated. A Pan∣theon, a Play-House, a Concert-Room, a Cornely's, and a Temple for the re∣ception of masques, were all pretty nearly in the same forwardness; and publick curiosity was already so much attracted, that, <HI>Shenstone-Green,</HI> was become the gape and stare of all the
<PB N="3" REF="9"/>surrounding countries. The children of expectation (who are ever upon the catch to subsist upon the projects of local luxury) came rolling down upon us in torrents; players, fidlers, singers, dancers, and every other in∣strument of voluptuous expence, spread themselves over the plain, and anticipated their future salary. And, in order to subsist in the mean time, they set the women upon coaxing me out of consent to their erecting several temporary booths, to entertain the pensioners, till the more regular build∣ings should be finished. According∣ly, having put refusal out of my reach, I shook my head, and gave up the point: so that all the fooleries of a fair were now every night practised
<PB N="4" REF="10"/>on <HI>Shenstone-Green.</HI> Poor Seabrooke, grew so thoroughly disgusted with these doings, that he scarce ever went out of the Mansion-house, unless, it was to lay upon the grass-plats in the garden, or seek the shade of the wood, by a private path: and whenever any body spoke on the subject, he whistled.</P>
<P>I must not conceal from the reader, that Mr. Danby took a very active part in this business; since he dismissed the woman, he was a great favourite with the ladies of the <HI>Green.</HI> The mind of that young man was, in truth, so turned to expence and magnifi∣cence; his natural spirits were so excessive; and his imagination so ex∣panded, that every new idea, which
<PB N="5" REF="11"/>was set off by gaiety, commanded his whole attention, and drove him to the last extremities. Several striking instances of this appeared in the course of carrying on the new build∣ings. As the ladies had now unani∣mously chosen him to be master of their ceremonies, and director in chief of all their plans; he thought his character at stake, in doing justice to every thing that had been put under his care. To this end, he flew up from Wales to London, and from London to Paris, and so down again to the <HI>Green,</HI> with almost incredible rapidity. And presently after these excursions, we had such waggon and boat-loads full of beautiful <HI>bagatelles,</HI> which, though they cost the most
<PB N="6" REF="12"/>serious fums of money, did real ho∣nour to the taste of this handsome agent, who had the art of dissipating so very delicately, that every lady protested it would be an honour to leave herself pennyless, rather than damp the superb choice of decora∣tions, which so characterised their favourite. Can I, dear reader, con∣fess to thee without a fatherly blush, that even the innocent Matilda was quite captivated with the brilliant extravagance of her accomplished Danby. The fact seems to be, that women are more easily dazzled with the qualities of such men, than they are convinced of their imprudence. The elegant spirit of a Mr. Danby, though it brings ruin and desolation
<PB N="7" REF="13"/>along with it, hath I doubt, more charms for the women, than all the punctual precisions of prudence, or the regulations of oeconomy. Ma∣tilda saw in this youth an excellent heart joined to a most amiable form —She saw that every action was ani∣mated, and every idea grand. He had fought; he had conquered in her cause. The very nature of his <HI>ren∣contre</HI> flattered her self-love. In a word, her object was lovely, and she loved with all her soul.</P>
<P>I was, perhaps, the only person, except the steward (for Seabrooke became a recluse) who felt particu∣larly the extraordinary conduct of this gentleman. Being neither blind to his virtues nor follies, I beheld
<PB N="8" REF="14"/>with real anxiety the great mixture of good and bad in his character, and wished it were possible to separate them, for unless that could be done I shuddered at the very thought of trusting him with the guardianship of Matilda's happiness. His present habit of profusion, countenanced, and even courted as he was to in∣dulge it, would have led him to im∣poverish a nation instead of a village; and I therefore determined to take some seasonable opportunity to re∣monstrate with him before it might be too late.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="46" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="9" REF="15"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. XLVI. BEING AS GAY AND GALLANT A CHAPTER AS ANY IN THE BOOK.</HEAD>
<P>SUCH an opportunity as I desired, however, not immediately hap∣pening, I was obliged to pospone my intention in regard to Mr. Danby, who, in the mean time, was running the same career, and gathering fame amongst the ladies, in proportion as he squandered their money. I carry you, reader, from hence, into the midst of things, and desire you will con∣ceive the appearance of <HI>Shenstone-Green</HI> no longer under the form of
<PB N="10" REF="16"/>a little circumscribed village, but un∣der that of a town, enriched by a regular Theatre, a regular Pantheon, a regular Masquerade, and a regular Musick-Room. When all these were fit for exhibition, Mr. Danby, in the triumph of his labours, which were now drawing to a period, gave a very grand ball and supper in the pantheon, by way of celebrating the completion of such a cluster of mag∣nificent projects. On this occasion I received a card, which invited Sea∣brooke, Matilda, and myself: but Seabrooke had taken a stroll into the country, and told me he should whistle and wander for some days, so that I had no opportunity of even showing him the note, for he had set
<PB N="11" REF="17"/>out the morning before, obstinately refusing all attendance, and taking with him one of the volumes of <HI>Shen∣stone,</HI> and his hazle walking-stick. Though I promised myself poor en∣tertainment, Matilda persuaded me to accept the invitation.</P>
<P>There is no splendour of language can <HI>over-describe</HI> the richness, nor the delicacy of this banquet, which might very properly have been given by any young monarch on his accession to the throne. You will draw your own inference therefore how far it was consistent with the situation of things at <HI>Shenstone-Green!</HI> The goddess of prodigality—if any such there be— seemed to have laid her finger on
<PB N="12" REF="18"/>every part of the entertainment; and yet Mr. Danby had so contrived the matter as to reconcile avarice him∣self to the scene, and make it impossi∣ble to upbraid. The ball was opened by Mr. Danby and Matilda, who danced a minute with such inexpressi∣ble grace, and so much to the joy and amazement of the whole com∣pany, that—pray forgive me, reader —I was quite flattered into an obil∣vion of consequences, and joined in the pleasures of the evening as heartily as the rest. Exclusively in∣deed of the pride of the parent, exulting at the applauses which an only child had very innocently ac∣quired; there were many other things to keep up the gaity of the season,
<PB N="13" REF="19"/>and nurse that forgetfulness, which is sometimes so necessary to pleasure. In about five minutes after my arri∣val, a noble band of musick put itself in order to play an occasional <HI>hymn to gratitude,</HI> which was to be sung by the pensioners, and was the produc∣tion of Mr. Danby. The turn, the conduct, and the sentiment of this little composition, discovered at once the good heart and fine genius of the author, who, while it was performing, came from his chair, and held over my head a radiant canopy, on which were displayed the figures of <HI>Benevo∣lence</HI> and <HI>Charity.</HI> Next advanced all the female pensioners, adorned with chaplets of roses, and strewed the way for the fair Matilda with
<PB N="15" REF="20"/>flowers. Scarce was this ceremony over, before the general joy was yet increased by the appearance of Mr. Edward Elixir, who came into the room by a private folding door, with the machine of his wife, who sat therein like the image of plenty, and was drawn round the room twice in state by the apothecary, who laughed, tagged, and capered incessantly, till he was obliged to draw off the cara∣van, and go peaceably home to his bed. But the scene which succeeded this was of such a nature, and con∣trived with a grace so admirable, that had Mr. Danby ruined the universe that very evening, there are few rea∣ders who would not pardon it, in
<PB N="14" REF="21"/>consideration of what is going to be told them.</P>
<P>Matilda and this young gentleman being engaged in the same plot, which both had projected, and carried on with the utmost secrecy, I was not prepared for the surprize that I felt, on beholding Hackney Oldblade, dres∣sed in a sea-officer's new uniform, enter the room, between Mr. Henry Hewit on the one hand, and his daughter Fanny, dressed in white, on the other. They were no sooner come in, than Mr. Danby and Matilda walked up, and began a ceremony which they had prepared. Immedi∣ately the musicians exerted their ut∣most skill, in doing all possible justice
<PB N="16" REF="22"/>to a <HI>nuptial ode,</HI> which Mr. Danby had written, the words of which, were divinely sung by Matilda. During the ode Mr. Danby spread a white banner before Henry Hewit, while Matilda dispalayed another in honour of Fanny. Then the wreaths and garlands were entwined round their heads, and a silver label held up to the view, sparkling with the follow∣ing inscription: <HI>The New-married Couple; or, the Celebration of an Union betwixt Honour and Beauty.</HI> While the company were expressing their surprize at this spectacle, in came the reverend Mr. Cusheon (whose frailty is, I trust, a good natured secret, reader, betwixt me and thee). Mr.
<PB N="17" REF="23"/>Cusheon paid his compliments to the new-married folks, whom, it seems, he had very lately attended to the altar; and they were then presented to me by my daughter.</P>
<P>Whatever ugly whispers might have gone abroad to poor Fanny's disad∣vantage, prior to this circumstance, they were all effectually done away by this generous manoeuvre, insomuch, that all the ladies followed the fair example of <HI>Matilda,</HI> and the gentle∣men took their pattern from <HI>my</HI> be∣haviour.</P>
<P>Thus was the deep-wound in the heart of our soldier suddenly healed up, and the honour of his family totally redeemed.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="24"/>It is not necessary to enquire, whe∣ther this respect to poor Fanny Old∣blade was real or affected on the part of the ladies. We had so absolutely shut the lips of detraction, that the power of her opening them again, <HI>maliciously,</HI> was taken away; and from that night, this lovely young woman, with honest Henry Hewit, lived the happiest, and perhaps, the <HI>most vir∣tuous</HI> pair in the precincts of <HI>Shenstone-Green.</HI></P>
<P>The evening concluded with a morsel of eloquence, pronounced by Mr. Danby, on the nature of the diversions which were then about to commence, and in this discourse (which might have graced the mouth of a member of the <HI>Belles Lettres,</HI> at his
<PB N="19" REF="25"/>being admitted into the French aca∣demy) our young president showed himself to be as able a reasoner, and as perfect an orator as he was before known to be a man of elegance and dissipation.</P>
<P>At the end of his speech, he adjusted the times and seasons for opening and shutting the places of diversion, and, in short, fixed every thing on a plan, in which would be offered not only the greatest variety, but in which, also, each amusement would be crowned with the <HI>eclat</HI> of the com∣pany.</P>
<P>By such means Mr. Danby made one of the most expensive evening's pleasure too <HI>agreeable</HI> to admit the
<PB N="20" REF="26"/>obtruding idea of what it <HI>cost,</HI> and, by artfully ornamenting the cause, blinded the spectator, till it was im∣possible for him to look forward to the effect.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XLVII. THE GLORY OF SHENSTONE-GREEN PROMISETH TO FADE AWAY.</HEAD>
<P>THE talisman, however, which bound up our senses, was bro∣ken to pieces the very next morning, and the charm was no more. Strip∣ped of her sparkling decorations, Folly appeared full in view, and Justice (with scourges in her hand, and terrour in her eye) pursued her close.</P>
<P>The distress began with the appear∣ance of Mr. Samuel Sarcasm, who gave me a fresh packet of papers. Every one was of tremendous length,
<PB N="22" REF="28"/>and the sum total threatened with bankruptcy or imprisonment.</P>
<P>Upon a stricter scrutiny, they ap∣peared to be a bundle of claims, which were made upon certain of the pen∣sioners for work done, and goods furnished, to the gross amount of many thousand guineas.</P>
<P>But what are these to <HI>me,</HI> Samuel said I, laying down the papers?</P>
<P>We will examine first the premises, and then draw our inference, if your Honour pleases, answered Samuel.</P>
<P>Here Samuel put on his spectacles and read aloud.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="29"/><HI>The second petition of the female pen∣sioners to their patron,</HI> SIR B. BEAUCHAMP.</P>
<P>SHOWETH,</P>
<P>THAT your petitioners do not at all doubt, but the execution of their several projects (under the superin∣tendance of D. Danby, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR>) has been honoured with your warmest ap∣probation.</P>
<P>THAT <HI>Shenstone-Green</HI> is now so ex∣ceedingly crouded with company (in expectation of the first opening of the diversions) that, it is with the utmost difficulty either beds or accommoda∣tions of any kind can be found; your petitioners observe, moreover, faces and forms moving about of all
<PB N="24" REF="30"/>sorts, sizes, cuts, and countries, which they take to be so many proofs of the great popularity the <HI>Green</HI> must already be in.</P>
<P>THAT the uncommon <HI>improvements,</HI> made within a few months last past, are of such a nature, as must soon give the pattern of perfection to Europe, of which <HI>Shenstone-Green</HI> will be at once the glory and the surprize; in con∣sequence of which your petitioners, willing to do poetical justice in the fullest degree, earnestly recommend an immediate alteration of the <HI>name</HI> of their new <HI>Paradise.</HI></P>
<P>THAT instead of <HI>Shenstone-Green</HI> (which seems only to imply a petty piece of
<PB N="25" REF="31"/>ground with a few cottages scattering about, and some goslings grazing thereupon) your petitioners humbly propose it should assume a magnitude of sound agreeable to the pomp it it has received by the labours of your petitioners. To this end they offer two titles for consideration—namely, <HI>Shenstone-City,</HI> or the <HI>City of Shen∣stone.</HI></P>
<P>THAT your petitioners beg leave to take down the figure of the late William Shenstone, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> from a pedestal (which they conceive disgraces him) in order to replace a statue to his memory, wor∣thy of such an <HI>angel of a man,</HI> and to make the <HI>City</HI> of <HI>Shenstone,</HI> or <HI>Shen∣stone-City,</HI> all of a piece.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="32"/>THAT zealous to do every thing which may merit your applause, your peti∣tioners intend ordering <HI>their poet</HI> to be cast in a mould of solid silver, properly embellished, with the emblem of a large fountain of the same metal, run∣ning a stream of gold at the bottom of his feet, to show his unbounded generosity. Underneath the fountain we propose the following motto, taken (as Mr. Danby says) from a contem∣porary poet:
<Q>Behold, the genial current of his soul.</Q></P>
<P>THAT your petitioners humbly beg they may be honoured with <HI>your</HI> image also, which, though already engraven upon the tablet of their hearts, they are ambitious of seeing publickly ex∣hibited
<PB N="27" REF="33"/>as a new ornament of their city. They propose to have Sir Benjamin Beauchamp, represented in the attitude of opening his arms wide to the universe, and the fol∣lowing inscriptions on the front of the pedestal:
<Q><L>Come unto me all ye who are heavy laden.</L>
<L>See Beauchamp's plan unfolds the soul of <HI>Shenstone.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>THAT filled with the warmest gra∣titude, which can possibly affect the human heart, your petitioners are not perfectly contented with the simple titles of Sir Benjamin Beauchamp, and William Shenstone, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> but under∣standing that most of the persons, now canonized, have been <HI>sainted</HI> for
<PB N="28" REF="34"/>things of less note than the present magnificent circumstance, they wish the pedestals to signify the following intelligence: For example,</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="35"/>SAINT SHENSTONE The <HI>Sage,</HI> Who wrote out the finest plan for The finest Town in the World.</P>
<P>SAINT BEAUCHAMP The <HI>Benevolent,</HI> Who built upon the plan of <HI>Saint Shenstone</HI> A whole City, Which, from a small beginning, arose to be the wonder of the world. And the whole By the voluntary Bounty of one Man, viz.</P>
<P>SAINT BEAUCHAMP. "Large was his bounty, and his soul sincere." These Statues of Solid Silver, Erected by those, whom his Liberality Protected, In the year of their supreme Felicity— and of Our Lord God—</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="36"/>THAT, lastly, your petitioners, hav∣ing now completed their views, do subscribe with all their souls to defray the expenses as much as in them lies, and beg Saint Beauchamp will <HI>ad∣vance</HI> (on the pension of all the females) the sum of twenty thousand pounds, to be paid back to Saint B. by in∣stallments, allowing to the pensioners in the mean while (by way of annuity) <HI>i. e.</HI> to each person, only the neat yearly sum of—</P>
<P>Here I interrupted Mr. Sarcasm, by very vehemently exclaiming— Mighty God, man, why this is down∣right frenzy—frenzy from the begin∣ning to the end—Twenty thousand pounds quotha?—</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="37"/>Why your <HI>Saintship</HI> knoweth, an∣swered the steward, that—</P>
<P>A truce with your foolery, Mr. Sarcasm, cried I, again interrupting him, I perceive plainly that too much indulgence hath let loose upon me all the violent passions of human nature. What, Samuel, dost thou suppose, or do these foolish women suppose, I built me a neighbourhood to bring into it all the vices and luxuries of a large city! No, Samuel, let them be told that I raised up the walls of <HI>my</HI> little town to reclaim errour, and protect distress: to fill the forlorn heart with innocent glad∣ness; to conceal the blushes of un∣premeditated mistake, and screen from the fury of the world such objects as
<PB N="32" REF="38"/>were lest defended from its rapacity. Fie upon them! They have <HI>lost my Paradise already.</HI> Tell them so from me, Samuel. Tell them they have brought sin and shame into my <HI>Eden,</HI> and deserve to be driven out like the original offenders.</P>
<P>I will report what your Honour desireth me, said Samuel, putting his spectacles with the most provoking <HI>sang-froid</HI> into their case, and then walking off.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XLVIII. SOME OF THE FIGURES ON SHEN∣STONE-GREEN DISAPPEAR.</HEAD>
<P>IT is incredible to conceive the con∣fusion and the uproar which this angry message produced in the village. Every creditor was up in arms, and Mr. Danby, the unfortunate presi∣dent (who had been the acting mem∣ber in all the buildings, and their ornaments) was obliged to take re∣fuge in the house of Hackney Old∣blade, who, with sword in hand, guarded him from the threats of the clamourous multitude till midnight.
<PB N="34" REF="40"/>Matilda no sooner heard of Danby's situation, than she fell at my feet, and, (with an energy which could come only from the heart) begged that I would sacrifice her thousand pounds a year to a man, whose free∣dom was much dearer to her than fortune, and which, she said, ought to be purchased with every thing she had in the world. But, before I had time to answer this extravagant effusion of tenderness, a man ap∣peared on horseback at my door, who presented a letter to the first servant he saw, and then rode off again at full speed. The epistle was without date, and evidently written by a trembling hand.</P>
<LETTER>
<PB N="35" REF="41"/>
<HEAD><HI>To Sir</HI> Benjamin Beauchamp. <HI>At</HI> Beauchamp Mansion-House, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THAT I may not seem as con∣temptible as prodigal, I catch up a sorry pen, at an inn on the road, to tell you, that I leave <HI>Shenstone-Green,</HI> more to shun the horrour of appearing again under the just re∣proaches of <HI>your</HI> eye, than from any event that could take place to my own personal inconvenience. I have offended the <HI>two</HI> only persons whose esteem ought ever to have been most facred—I have offended too <HI>myself.</HI> I am ashamed—con∣vinced, and in despair—</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>D. DANBY.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P><PB N="36" REF="42"/>
Over this letter I hurried my eye and put it into my pocket, to prevent its being discovered by my daughter, who was but too much agitated already. I promised every thing she wished, and had the good fortune to pacify her so far as to dry her tears, and persuade her to withdraw to her chamber.</P>
<P>Scarce had she retired, when the steward came again to the Mansion∣House with new burdens of petition and remonstrance. The examination of these I would then have avoided upon almost any conditions; but the steward said, the salvation of <HI>Shenstome-Green</HI> absolutely depended on my giving to <HI>every one</HI> the most
<PB N="37" REF="43"/>serious and immediate attention. Sir, said Samuel, your honour can have no conception of the present state of your village or that of your villagers, unless you will dedicate this whole morning to the full examination of all those parcels now before you.</P>
<P>Alarmed at this intelligence, and still more at the aweful manner by which it was introduced, I sat down tremblingly to the scrutiny.</P>
<P>To particularize the articles con∣tained in this fresh catalogue of follies (which now extended themselves over the <HI>Green</HI> would be equally tedious and distressing. I shall, therefore, for the reader's peace of mind, com∣press all the facts together, and offer
<PB N="38" REF="44"/>him a general idea of the whole, by means of the following abridgements of each address.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM><LABEL>FIRST,</LABEL> Several pensioners complained, that, they had been ill-used by their neighbours in points either of fame or fortune, property or character; the consequence of which was, either, that I must openly countenance duels, put the law into every man's hands, with pistol and poignard, or else I must establish a Court of Justice, in which causes should be heard and crimes punished.</ITEM>
<ITEM><LABEL>SECONDLY,</LABEL> That the spirit of private gaming had arisen to so fatal an excess in <HI>Shenstone-Green,</HI> that, most of the
<PB N="39" REF="45"/>pensioners had caught the contagion, and some had even mortgaged their annuities to a fellow who purchased lives, and enriched himself by im∣poverishing others; so that all the practises of Change alley had travel∣led down to <HI>Whenstone-Green.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><LABEL>THIRDLY,</LABEL> Bailiffs and their attendants were busy in every quarter of <HI>Shenstone-Green,</HI> to serve their special originals and their running writs upon the bodies of insolvent pensioners; so that officers of justice picked a very pretty fortune out of the pockets of the <HI>Shenstonians.</HI></ITEM>

<P>THAT a society of pensioners accus∣tomed to publick disputation, and to speak their sentiments on important subjects, found themselves so incapable of relishing the <HI>frivolity</HI> and froth of those other pensioners (who were at∣tracted only by gewgaw and glitter) that they found the time insufferably long upon <HI>Shenstone-Green.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="53"/>THAT in order to compensate for this dearth of intellectual entertainment, they proposed (with my permission) to institute an <HI>Academy of Dispute,</HI> where science and the <HI>belles lettres,</HI> and morality, were to be debated, encouraged, and cultivated.</P>
<P>THAT no expence whatever should attend the prosecution of this project, except that of fitting up a few benches or forms for the audience, and a ros∣trum for the president, who was, of course, to be Sir Benjamin Beau∣champ.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. L. THE WHISTLER EXALTS HIS VOICE IN THIS CHAPTER.</HEAD>
<P>THE steward had scarcely stepped over the threshold, when my old and excellent friend Mr. Seabrooke (besprent with dust, and burnished by the tan of that sun, upon which he so much doated) made his appear∣ance.</P>
<P>I ran to him with that ardour, which denotes an affection founded upon a long experience of admirable qualities—qualities which his inno∣cent
<PB N="50" REF="56"/>oddities served only to render the more endearing.</P>
<P>He shook me heartily by the hand, and then whistled his loudest note to summon Matilda, who, however, was indisposed in her chamber; she was indeed, too ill to stir from her apart∣ment; so, without any more ceremony, Seabrooke took two or three strides up the stairs, and was soon dandling his little favourite in his arms, and asking all the tender questions that could possibly come from a man of his tenderness.</P>
<P>But Matilda came and asked me softly, if Mr. Danby was at liberty?</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="57"/>I said (in the same under-tone of voice) that, he <HI>was:</HI> upon which the poor girl caught such spirits, that she ran to Seabrooke, and chided him for his cruel excursion, at a time too, said she, when I wanted my old play∣fellow more than ever I did in my life; and such sunny weather too!</P>
<P>Then let us have all our different adventures, since parting, related over a dish of good tea, said Seabrooke. <HI>Whew— quick— Whew—</HI></P>
<P>In the bow-window if you please, papa, which looks towards <HI>Shenstone-Green;</HI> because then, you know, if any person should happen to come, we shall all be ready to receive him, and fetch a cup in a moment.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="58"/>The idea of Danby's freedom, had so well recovered her, that she trip∣ped down stairs as agil as a hare, and the tea-equipage was prepared with∣out delay.</P>
<P>I took the lead in the present con∣versation, and circumstantially related (without any other reserve than that of concealing Mr. Danby's name) every transaction that had passed since, Mr. Seabrooke set off on his ramble.</P>
<P>At the close of this lamentable account, Seabrooke gave a long whis∣tle, and said, with an emphasis highly marked that, he was now convinced of what he had before suspected. <HI>Whew</HI>—said he,—'tis now clear: 'tis absolute sunshine.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="59"/>I desired the assistance of his friend∣ship, showing, very pathetically (by a fear which then flowed from my heart to his hand, that I was as deeply <HI>affected</HI> as <HI>deceived).</HI></P>
<P>Matilda ran softly on the opposite side to kiss my cheek, and Mr. Sea∣brooke addressed me thus: Sir Benjamin Beauchamp, you are, I find, a man to be <HI>looked at,</HI> but not <HI>followed.</HI> As soon as I heard of your project, I came to see how human nature would behave, under the exe∣cution of such a whim. In Glamor∣ganshire (said I to myself, upon read∣ing your plan) resides a man whom I would travel seven times seven over the Alps, in the dead of winter to
<PB N="54" REF="60"/>know: his heart must be the noblest in the world. Accordingly, I travelled on foot to <HI>Shenstone-Green,</HI> where, I found your disposition even greater than I imagined, and I resolved to pass some time with you in <HI>Paradise.</HI> But a very few days elapsed before I was obliged to stretch myself on the grass-plats in the eye of the sun, that I might not see too much of my fel∣low-creatures. I every hour remarked that <HI>modern man,</HI> without the rod often snaken over his head, and the whip smacked in his ear, was as an horse of spirit without any bridle. The poor animals whom—to carry on the allusion—you had taken from the barren heath (where they were starving upon thistles) to place, of a
<PB N="55" REF="61"/>sudden, in the luxuriant pasture, where the corn and grass came mantling to their chests—were turned too rapidly loose to become steady. They first grew fat, then indolent, next restive, and last <HI>vicious.</HI> I heard them snort disdain; and I saw them lift the hoof against the very benefactor, who put on their shoes, and gave the vigour to kick. Yet I pitied rather than blamed: I considered whether this was pure baseness, or the inevitable consequence of situation, operating on peculiar temperament and character. —<HI>Too happy</HI> creatures said I, <HI>are</HI> these steeds of Sir Benjamin Beauchamp; for which reason they must <HI>soon</HI> be <HI>too miserable.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="62"/>Had they been timely broken to the bit, and taught an early obedi∣ence to the curb: had they been put into proper training, there is no mo∣tive to suppose they would not have been most of them serviceable animals —and—</P>
<P>Does nothing then but rigid disci∣pline create virtue, said I, Mr. Sea∣brooke?</P>
<P>No, replied Seabrooke, discipline hath no influence over Henry Hewit, Hackney. Oldblade, Matilda Beau∣champ, nor some other persons of our acquaintance. Good and gentle cha∣racters, require no other impulse to virtue than the dictate of the heart, which is their unerring rule of right;
<PB N="57" REF="63"/>but the majority, being neither gentle not good; it is necessary to prevent the force of bad habit or bad nature, by the interposition of wholesome laws. But in <HI>Shenstone-Green,</HI> none of these could be established consist∣ently with the proprietor's <HI>delicacy.</HI></P>
<P>You have <HI>seen,</HI> you have <HI>felt</HI> the consequence, Sir Benjamin.</P>
<P>I sighed bitterly in echo to a sigh from Matilda, and then, Mr. Sea∣brooke continued.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. LI. IN WHICH THE WHISLER'S PIPE IS PARTICULARLY IN TUNE.</HEAD>
<P>HURT, and disgusted with seeing how impossible it is to leave human beings to their own discretion, in the present state of society, and really concerned so early to perceive, the absolute madness of establishing a system of pure obligation and benevo∣lence on the one hand, and of grati∣tude on the other, I wanted yet to try, if there was no way for a man to be liberal without doing at the same
<PB N="59" REF="65"/>time as much harm as good. Two or three days did I contemplate this subject, as I lay in the sun upon your grass-plats, my friend; and, at length, an idea came across, which set me upon my legs to some purpose: for, I have measured near sixty miles, in my sauntering way, Sir Benjamin, since I left the Mansion-house, and now I am returned thoroughly satisfied, that I can <HI>oppose</HI> our friend <HI>Shenstone</HI> in every part of his scheme. Nay I am, at this time, able to set one of his observations against another. Pray compare <HI>that</HI> notion of his from whence you took your hint, and which was, indeed, the foundation of the village, with what follows:
<PB N="60" REF="66"/><Q>I have been formerly so silly as to hope (says our poet in one of his egotisms) that every servant I had might be made a friend; I am now convinced, that the nature of servitude bears a <HI>contrary</HI> tendency. It is the nature of servitude also, to discard all <HI>generous</HI> motives to obe∣dience; and to point out no other, than those scoundrel ones of interest and fear.</Q></P>
<P>Now, take my word for it, con∣tinued, Mr. Seabrooke, that, all pen∣sions upon the <HI>Shenstone</HI> principle, are <HI>too generously</HI> and <HI>too largely</HI> bestowed, not to reduce the person thereby benefitted to a state of slavery and <HI>obligation,</HI> which (unless such person
<PB N="61" REF="67"/>happens to have the heart of a Henry Hewit) must, of necessity, introduce idleness, which will beget voluptuous∣ness, which will terminate in vice.</P>
<P>Had we been convinced of these facts some time ago, Mr. Seabrooke, said I, how many pangs of heart, as well as purses of solid gold might have been spared.</P>
<P>I was not clear in the point myself, answered Seabrooke, till I had more particularly proved it in my late ex∣cursion; of which I will now give <HI>you</HI> and Matilda an account. He paused, and then went on.</P>
<P>As I grasped my hazle-stick on the morning of my departure, surely, said
<PB N="62" REF="68"/>I, it is possible for a man to be at once wise and generous. Let us see. To this purpose, I bent my way over the mountains, resolved to stop at every hut or hamlet that should rise up in the road. My scheme was to do what, I fear, the <HI>Shenstonian</HI> plan does not permit—namely, to try the worth of my object <HI>before</HI> I admi∣nistred relief. Pigmy as I am, I stood upon the galled shoulders of that giant of generosity, Sir Benjamin, and so saw farther. To forward this my stratagem, I tore off a corner of my hat, as you see, to make myself look properly miserable; I cut a couple of slits in my shoes, picked a few holes in the most obvious parts of my coat,
<PB N="63" REF="69"/>taking care that the buttons should, in several places be wanting—because there is nothing more denotes penury, than the disappearance of a button, particularly, if the old threads are suffered to hang about—and shaking the powder out of my wig (which you know has not been acquainted with combs, since I came into your poetical country) sallied into the poorest part of Wales, under pretence of being the poorest fellow in it. Thus accoutered, I entered every cottage, whose mud walls were either bleaching on the hills, or skulking amongst the vallies. I knocked with∣out ceremony at every door, and often let myself in by means of a latch. Without the least ceremony I took a
<PB N="64" REF="70"/>chair, or (if chairs were scarce) a stool, and set myself down with the family. If they were at dinner, I dined also; if they were at work, I joined in the bustle, and would take mop or broom out of the damsel's hand without say∣ing a syllable. You know, Matilda, what a proud odd sort of saucy beg∣gar I am. It will be impossible to tell you half the singular events, which trod upon the heel of this singular conduct.—Some thought I was mad, others merry. Some be∣lieved I was a conjurer, others an impostor. What of that, I had my plan before me, and I pursued it without deviation. Whether I was well or ill treated, I stayed always long enough to find out the history
<PB N="65" REF="71"/>of the hut; its misfortunes, its pro∣sperities. Hence, the characters of the present possessors were developed of course. Sometimes I have entered a wretched-looked cottage (where penury seemed to sit staring in a use∣less chimney-corner without a faggot to call the blood into her fingers) and I have, on enquiry, found, the inhabitants so rich in content, that I dared not venture to leave with them more than half a crown or at most five shillings, for fear I should over∣whelm them with sudden indepen∣dence, and so ruin the family. Had I left a whole guinea in such a hut, the prosperity would have been so great, that four girls who were then singing at their wheels, would not
<PB N="66" REF="72"/>have returned to spinning till idleness and dissipation had made them almost forget how to wind the wool round their lazy fingers. At other times I have gone into a house, where, by the diligence of the cottagers, all sorts of penury seemed to be banished; where the floor was nicely sanded, the pewter shone like mirrours, and the goodly rows of crockery, mended at top and bottom, garnished the chimney-piece; and yet, before I took my leave, I have found the family so <HI>truly</HI> poor, and so absolutely <HI>prudent,</HI> that it might be trusted with the enormous sum of five pounds, although it came pouring upon them in a <HI>sudden</HI> shower of gold. Such a sum <HI>did</HI> I give to such a family, Sir Benjamin, and
<PB N="67" REF="73"/>what reason have I (more than you yet know) think you, to assure my∣self my bounty was well-placed? Why, you shall hear. I took out the money just after we had been banquetting on some excellent pota∣toes without butter, and as soon as I had told the five pounds—guineas, in fact, I ought to say—<HI>here</HI> (said I, to a good woman who sat opposite) these are to pay you for some of the best potatoes dressed in the nicest way, and served up in the cleanest manner I ever saw. As I chucked the cash across the table, one of the guineas tumbled on a farthing platter and broke it in two. After curtesying, many times too often, and putting the money into her pocket, she gave
<PB N="68" REF="74"/>the broken plate to her husband and said—here Robin—a farthing is a farthing, and the good gentleman has —God bless him—given us five gui∣neas; that is no reason why we should grow more extravagant than usual, so pray, Robin, mend the platter. This, Robin, who was the family mechanick, did in a very little time; and at night it bore the weight of the potatoes, warmed up a second time, as well as ever. I must not forget to tell you, though, that sometimes I have made my passage into huts, through all the sauciness and brutality that was ever practised, even by the pampered children of <HI>Shenstone-Creen.</HI> I have met fellows that would neither suffer me to sit upon stool or chair;
<PB N="69" REF="75"/>who have opposed my entering into any conversation, and refused to give me a crust when I affected to be in the misery which my appearance jus∣tified. But, having authority in my hand, I always in such cases, <HI>i. e,</HI> after I found them reprobate—put my hand quietly into my pocket, and then took from my purse eight or ten guineas under pretence of wanting change: then, having thoroughly opened every mouth with wonder, and silenced every tongue with shame, I was generous enough to give the ungrateful rascals a WHISTLE and set off for fresh adventures.</P>
<P>Matilda here leaped on Mr. Sea∣brooke's knee, and kissed him with all her heart.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="76"/>Mr. Elixir (whom I forgot to tell the reader, had come into the room just as the tea-kettle was brought) cried, laughed, skipped, and bounded at Mr. Seabrooke's relation.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. LIII. A MORE INTERESTING DISCOVERY THAN COULD BE IMAGINED.</HEAD>
<P>FROM this account Mr. Seabrooke, said I, it appears that, with the small sum of one year's payment of your pension—nay, scarce the half of it, you have done more rational and more real service to society than poor silly Sir Benjamin Beauchamp with all his thousand pounds, and fair snow of <HI>Shenstonian</HI> houses and the annuity settled upon their inhabi∣tants.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="86"/>Before any answer or remark could be made upon this reflexion, a servant opened the door of our apartment, to introduce, under cover of the night (which was then come on) assisted by a disguise, a man who fell at my feet the moment he could reach me.</P>
<P>Sir, said the disguised person, I cannot rest till I have personally de∣manded pardon for the—</P>
<P>Gracious Providence, exclaimed Seabrooke, in the most violent emo∣tion —that voice should belong to—</P>
<P>Mr. Danby—cried Matilda.</P>
<P><HI>Danby</HI>—answered Seabrooke with perfect amazement—yes—it may be so—that may perhaps be the name which—</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="87"/>I have taken upon me (said the man) to conceal the faults which dis∣graced the family of—</P>
<P>Whom! (cried Seabrooke, stagger∣ing against the wainscot) the family of whom?—</P>
<P>Of Sir Matthew Davies, replied the gentleman, unmuffling his face, and discovering Mr. Danby.</P>
<P>My <HI>nephew</HI> here, cried Seabrooke, by what accident is he arisen from the dead?</P>
<P>The dead! said I.</P>
<P>Your nephew! Mr. Seabrooke, de∣manded Matilda? Your nephew, Mr. Seabrooke, did you say?</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="88"/>Call me not Seabrooke any more, madam; I am that unhappy Sir Matthew Davies, who fed and nursed that <HI>fictitious</HI> Danby upon my knee, when his parents were in their graves; but his extravagant benevolence drove him from my arms to some foreign shore, where it was afterwards reported he died. Speak, Danvers Davies, am I not relating facts?</P>
<P>They are too true, answered the young man; I had committed excesses which I deemed impossible for you to forgive, and, that I might never be thought of more, determined to abscond for ever, and feigned myself dead.</P>
<P>Since which time, I suppose, said Sir Matthew, you have been more prudent.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="89"/>Not a whit, sir, replied young Da∣vies. This gentleman can tell you that I have been the most prodigal, most thoughtless—</P>
<P>Fie! sir, said Matilda half drowned in her tears, it's no such thing.</P>
<P>This gentleman's bounty, sir, found me in the retreat I had sought to hide myself, and he took me under his protection upon the credit of some good feelings, and in pity to many weaknesses. But scarce was I put in∣to <HI>Paradise</HI> before my unfortunate passions—</P>
<P>Lookee, Danvers, answered Sir Matthew, that you are a mixture of weeds and flowers I do not want to be told; nor do I desire to hear the his∣tory
<PB N="84" REF="90"/>of half the mad things you have committed, or by what multiplied stratagems you have sheltered your∣self from my enquiry, since you part∣ed six years ago from my house, I shall only tell you that I have thought about you as seldom as my heart would let me, and that now you ap∣pear unexpectedly before me, the weak part of my nature is too much melted to do any thing worse than shed over you the tears of pity and affection.</P>
<P>The uncle and nephew were weep∣ing in the neck of each other.</P>
<P>The disordered and half-dying Ma∣tilda ran into her father's arms for that consolation, which he had not the power to give her.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="91"/>The apothecary threw himself across two chairs, and sobbed with sorrow and joy.</P>
<P>I felt a mixture of sensations, of which, if the reader would wish to gain the true idea; it is necessary that he has been at some period of his life, in the same instant, inexpressibly wretched and inexpressibly happy.</P>

<P>Yes, papa, said Matilda, that is all the fault he has.</P>
<P>And what can be done, poor fool (said Sir Matthew, taking his nephew by the hand) to make it an honest lad
<PB N="87" REF="93"/>and less of a simpleton? But, between ourselves, Sir Benjamin, <HI>your's</HI> was the very worst school this young fel∣low could have gone to.

<PB N="88" REF="94"/><HI>jack o' th' lanthern,</HI> in your hands. It is dancing about in a fascinating manner, and is nothing but a spark∣ling vapour, which may bring those who are lighted by it into a hole, after all. But, no matter, I have a cure for all yet. Tremble, nephew, I have a cure for all yet.</P>
<P>During this whole scene, young Davies, the nephew, behaved with a contrition so sincere and so modest, yet so perfect a sense of his impro∣priety that I never saw him so truly to advantage; and it plainly appeared by every look and action of Matilda, that, with all his errours, he was more beloved by his mistress than ever.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="95"/>But the mystery of the <HI>travelling</HI> Mr. Seabrooke, who was so suddenly metamorphosed into Sir Matthew Da∣vies, the real uncle of the imagined Mr. Danby, sat still uneasy on my mind, till Sir Matthew himself cleared up the whole extraordinary affair, by first writing and then disclosing to me the following letter: which was ad∣dressed to the very friend who had recommended him to me.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR PECKHAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>OUR stratagem has been suc∣cessful as far as has been necessary, and I have passed upon your friend Benjamin, as Seabrooke the bank∣rupt and beggar, till this very day. All my curiosity hath been <HI>abun∣dantly</HI> satisfied, and (by means of my plot) in my own way; but within these four hours have fallen out two very extraordinary revolutions, which will not easily get from the memory. First, I have seen that a village built upon poetical principles will never stand the batter of the passions, which you know blows an hard gale
<PB N="91" REF="97"/>from every corner; and, Secondly, I shall ever have reason to bless the name of the dear chimerical SHENSTONE, who hath been the means of restoring to me that young rake of a nephew whom we thought dead. By some quondam interest or other he got in his name, or rather his name NOMINAL, for the pension; and, it seems, he has con∣tributed very liberally towards bring∣ing all manner of those ministers upon the <HI>Green,</HI> which are necessary to create fear and fair-dealing. But the boy has a fine soul, and I believe is so thoroughly ashamed of himself that he may yet come to something. If he does not, I shall whistle him off with a <HI>Whew.</HI> I
<PB N="92" REF="98"/>now wish you would write an ac∣count of my affairs in London just as they <HI>really</HI> are; for the mask of Seabrooke is taken off from this moment; and I have some master∣strokes to strike in the character of</P>

<P>P. S. The reports transmitted from <HI>Shenstone-Green</HI> to the Mansion-house, were, in general, so different from what a theoretic head and heated heart might be led to imagine, that I have not set my foot in the village more than four or five times; and have, indeed, chiefly led the life of a recluse. Had it not been for
<PB N="93" REF="99"/>our patron's daughter—a warm sun, a couple of excellent garden grass∣plats, and my consolitary <HI>whistle,</HI> I should have dropped my purpose long ago. Never build a <HI>Shenstone-Green,</HI> Peckham. Send me some∣thing to put on. I have some of the old suits still.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. LV. IN THE PARADISE OF SHENSTONE-GREEN, THE WEEDS SHOOT UP APACE.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN these young folks were retired—to do which required much aukward and delicate difficulty —Sir Matthew took hold of my hand, and exclaimed aloud—Lookee, Sir Benjamin, I see plainly the design which your daughter has upon my nephew. The point has been palpa∣ble ever since I found <HI>out</HI> the young rascal. But 'tis a match I do not ap∣prove, and if you please I will tell
<PB N="95" REF="101"/>you why—However, let them play their little tricks upon one another for the present, and in a day or two I will settle their love story, I warrant. The first matter is, the mischief which my young rake-shame had done in the vil∣lage; let us see how that matter stands.</P>
<P>I was about to reply to all the articles of this peculiar address, when the apothecary cried out, here is wor∣thy Mr. Sarcasm coming into the court-yard. Now for some news; here re-entered Matilda and Sir Mat∣thew's nephew, both blushing rosy red.</P>
<P>I have the honour to wait upon you at this time, upon sundry busi∣nesses
<PB N="96" REF="102"/>(said Samuel, as he bowed in his methodical manner to the com∣pany). Imprimis, you must know that the builders and fitters-up of the seve∣ral houses of amusement have con∣sented to take them into their own hands; partly, indeed, because most of the pensioners concerned therein have betaken themselves to flight; and the said builders and co. do in∣tend speedily advertising the same for SALE BY AUCTION.</P>
<P>And I will be a bidder, cried Sir Matthew. Samuel smiled upon the imagined Seabrooke, and went on.</P>
<P>Secondly, there are about thirteen houses vacated, which naturally drop
<PB N="97" REF="103"/>to my honoured master, Sir Benjamin Beauchamp.</P>
<P>Excellent, cried Sir Matthew, that is the most promising news I have heard yet. Those houses for the future shall be more prudently occu∣pied.</P>
<P>Mr. Samuel gave a second look at the supposed Seabrooke, and pro∣ceeded.</P>
<P>Thirdly, Mr. Hackney Old blade the lame soldier (lately preferred by your Honour) in conjunction with Mr. Henry Hewit, and Squire Sidney, have dipped their pensions pretty deep to do an action which seemed wise in <HI>their</HI> eyes though it seemed <HI>otherwise</HI> in mine.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="104"/>To wit, they have paid off certain claims made by the real creditors of the young gentleman, whom, if mine eyes fail me not, sitteth now by the side of that young lady.</P>
<P><HI>My</HI> claims, Mr. Sarcasm, did you say, (answered young Davies rising) my claims?</P>
<P>In troth, sir, rejoined Samuel, they were just debts, and would have gone abroad to your disadvantage, so the above gentlemen have bought up your character with the best part of their annuities.</P>
<P><HI>Whew,</HI> said Sir Matthew, there's for you! Yet do they pretend, that you have still the balance on your side— Now how far that is really the case is—</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="105"/>Hush—hush—cried young Davies.</P>
<P>As to that, sir, continued Samuel, it is fit that every gentleman should have his due, and as you have a sort of character that cannot be hurt by telling the good with the—the—<HI>the not quite so good,</HI> I should humbly conceive—</P>
<P>Hush I say, replied Davies, if you go on, I must absolutely leave the room.</P>
<P>Lord, how strange you are Danby (I should say Davies) said Matilda—pray, Mr. Sarcasm, tell every syllable that you know to his advantage, and I will bear you harmless.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="106"/>Pshaw, cried Sir Matthew, we all know that my nephew has gold amongst his dross, so drop that sub∣ject and get on to another Samuel.</P>
<P>The steward pricked up his ears at the word nephew, and gave Sir Matthew a third glance before he went on.</P>
<P>In the next place, sir, said Samuel addressing himself to me, I have to acquaint your Honour, as in duty bound, of a very long and ill-written petition (that I have received from the <HI>Shenstonian</HI> mechanicks) which in <HI>sub∣stance</HI> is—for I would not vex your Honour with seven sheets full of non∣sense—</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="107"/>That, as your Honour has suffered <HI>Shenstone-Green</HI> to be turned upside down by the whims of the <HI>independent</HI> pensioners, they think you will not object to a very reasonable proposition which they have to make, viz.</P>
<P>That you will humbly please to put them upon a par with those other <HI>Shenstonians,</HI> who have done nothing for their money; and fix some annual stipend to each trader independent of the drudgery of business—labour, they say, is no inheritance, and they pre∣tend that in a republick, like that of <HI>Shenstone-Green,</HI> all should be upon an equality. Not, that they lay par∣ticular stress upon this, your Honour —Not that they will refuse to stick
<PB N="102" REF="108"/>the knife into the throat of the lamb, nor put the dough into the oven, nor hew the wood, nor fetch the water, any more than when their livelyhood wholly depended upon these occupa∣tions, but because, seeing things take rather a curious turn, they suppose they have a natural right to join the chorus of that emulation which seems to be the grand passion of the good people of your Honour's <HI>Green.</HI> Upon this principle—which your Honour will allow is still <HI>poor Human Nature</HI>— they pray for the sinecure of a pen∣sion or annuity, exclusive of the mere profits of selling their commodities; by which indeed it doth already ap∣pear, that they cannot get so comfort∣able a subsistence as might be expected;
<PB N="103" REF="109"/>since the better sort of pensioners let their accounts with tradesmen run to a GENTEEL SIZE, and, in the hurry of quitting a <HI>Paradise</HI> of which they are <HI>tired,</HI> have, by mistake, forgotten to settle them.</P>
<P>Tradesmen, said Sir Matthew, have as good a title to take advantage of your incaution as any other people for ought I see. What a lesson for you, Danvers! continued he. What an example! See Danvers the noble pile in ruins! See <HI>Shenstone-Green</HI> a mere town of the world. See the utility of laws, and weep to think what a wild colt is a man when he but imagines himself wholly his own master.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="110"/>Samuel now looked more earnestly than before, and could not help say∣ing jocularly, that the gentleman had, in his opinion, wonderfully improved upon his <HI>Whew.</HI></P>
<P>Sarcasm, Sarcasm, said I, there wanted but this stroke of the trades∣men to finish the whole. Putting all things together then Sir Matthew.—</P>
<P>SIR MATTHEW, cried the steward!</P>
<P>Putting, I say, my dear Sir Matthew, all things together, it is clearly proved, that the only reasonable address which has been made to my bounty hath come from the pensioners who are now instituting the academy of dispute.</P>
<P>WHEW—said Sir Matthew.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="111"/>Odso, answered Samuel, I have a card to deliver your Honour from the gentlemen concerned in that mat∣ter. Here it is.</P>
<Q><P>The scientific society of <HI>Shenstonian</HI> academicians (who have been inde∣fatigably labouring to sweeten the village by some rational and solid pleasures) have now brought their scheme to such perfection that to∣morrow evening their Athenian en∣tertainments will be opened on the publick, at half past six o'clock. The business of the first night, which can only be a sort of general intro∣duction, will be for every member to state his principles and sentiments upon the noblest of all subjects— namely, that of RELIGION; because as
<PB N="106" REF="112"/>our motto is <HI>"Be ye of one Mind,"</HI> it is thought proper only to adopt such into the society as are steady in their <HI>faith,</HI> and distinguished by their <HI>good works.</HI> This society being for universal good, every body both in and out of the village will be admitted, at least for that night, and every man will have full liberty to utter his whole heart whatever be its bias or its prepos∣session.</P>
<P>Sir B. Beauchamp and his family are most humbly invited to partake this attick gratification, which, it is expected, will reclaim the unhappy disturbances lately created, and give a new form to the village.</P></Q>

<HEAD>CHAP. LVI. WHICH CARRIES ON THE PLOT TO THE READER'S SATISFACTION.</HEAD>
<P>MR. Elixir and Samuel were sent away with my compliments to the academicians, letting them know, that I and my party would certainly wait upon them at the time appointed.</P>
<P>When these men had left the room, Sir Matthew Davies turned about to his nephew, and, in the presence of Matilda, spoke thus—Lookee, Dan∣vers, I see your design is to get the affections of that young lady; now I
<PB N="108" REF="114"/>must honestly tell you, that I love her myself; and though I am ten years, or perhaps fifteen, too old for her, yet I have cherished serious thoughts of asking her to be my wife. Now, this is to give you notice that I shall most formidably stand between you and the accomplishment of your wishes —Nay, I shall very solemnly be your rival, till by a course of rational con∣duct you have got better argu∣ments on your side to supplant me than a fair face and the prime of your youth.</P>
<P>Do not think, young gentleman, that such a girl as Matilda is to be thrown away upon a fellow who has already contributed, not a little, to aid her father in squandering her na∣tural
<PB N="109" REF="115"/>inheritance. I say, don't you think this; for be assured—</P>
<P>Dear, sir, answered the beautiful youth with the tears shining in his eyes—dear uncle, if you could see now into my converted heart—if—</P>
<P>It is too early to make professions, replied Sir Matthew in the same com∣manding tone. I had rather look at your heart than hear your words. I make you a very generous offer. I will sacrifice my affection to your's when it is clear to the lady's father that you deserve the preference. That may easily <HI>be</HI> Danvers, for you have only to check your vile passion for magnificence, and you will be just
<PB N="110" REF="116"/>what you ought to be for my little play-mate there.</P>
<P>Indeed, Sir Matthew, cried Matilda, running to his knee as usual, I so well know the goodness of his heart— that—</P>
<P>Hush—<HI>Whew</HI>—hush, hussey— said the baronet. He knows the con∣ditions. Let him consider them. So now go and tell him from me, that he is a very handsome fellow, and that though he is my rival, I will neither run him through the body nor blow out his brains.</P>
<P>Here the good heart of Sir Matthew melted as he spoke, and he ran into his nephew's arms, begging him for
<PB N="111" REF="117"/>God's sake to make Matilda amends for having fooled away so much of her fortune. I take all this pains with thee, Danvers, said Sir Matthew, tenderly taking his hand, because thee hast a heart. But I oppress thee, poor fellow, go then, go, and let Ma∣tilda— What do <HI>you</HI> say though to this freedom, Sir Benjamin?</P>
<P>I say, Sir Matthew, said I, that we have tortuned them enough and cannot do better than leave them together till they recover themselves.</P>
<P>Aye, replied the baronet, I see plainly that you are all in a plot against poor Seabrooke. I shall be thrown out of my chance, and the
<PB N="112" REF="118"/>young rogue will run away with his uncle's mistress at last.</P>
<P>Sir Matthew gave me his hand, and we went out of the room tenderly admiring and esteeming one another.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. LVII. THE PHILOSOPHY OF FOOLS.</HEAD>
<P>AGREEABLE to promise we all went at the appointed hour to the Scientifick Society, which was held in the room that had been intended for masquerading. I was mightily pleased at the pomp with which I was serenaded from the door to the chair of state, which was emblemati∣cally decorated, and on which I was seated as President. Every thing was neat, clean and had methought an air truely classical. A paper was given
<PB N="114" REF="120"/>me which contained a list of those gentlemen's names who designed to speak that evening; and as the open∣ing of the entertainment was a kind of present made to the publick, it is easy to conceive what a multitude of people were collected. A person ap∣pointed to the office of announcing the business now read aloud (in a tone like the clerk of the papers in a court of justice) the following notice.</P>
<P><Q>O YES, this is to give notice, that all philosophers, divines and moralists, who have any questions to propose, or subjects to start, which may tend to the enlargement of human knowledge, are now de∣sired to propose and start them
<PB N="115" REF="121"/>freely, and such as are deemed wor∣thy of discussion shall be enrolled by the deputy in the repository or regis∣ter of the society for future debate and elucidation: this being the business of the present evening.</Q></P>
<P>A general hum murmured through the assembly after the clerk had whined out this notice, and then a bell rang to inform the audience that such as chose to speak might begin and address the President. In consequence of which I was spoken to in the fol∣lowing manner, while a man on the left hand side was taking his minutes of what past.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="122"/>I am one of those very poor crea∣tures called a man, Mr. President (said the first person that got upon his legs) I was born without power, knowledge, or instinct; I wanted force and cun∣ning to get the nipple of my mother's bosom into my mouth, and without assistance I must have died for want of suck, though the milk was full in my view. I grew higher and stronger till I was twenty-two years old, and I got into my head new ideas every day. At twenty-two years old, my reason became so strong that I set my∣self at work to find out the mechanick power or natural stimulus—or what you will—by which I was able to gather so many ideas and so much strength of body? Thirty years have
<PB N="117" REF="123"/>been passed, Mr. President, in this important study, and I am as ignorant upon the subject as if I were yet in my swathing clothes. I beg, there∣fore, this matter may be registered for the future consideration of this learned society.</P>
<P><HI>Registered.</HI></P>
<P>He sat down and gave place to</P>
<P>PHILOSOPHER THE SECOND.</P>
<P>I shall only trouble you with a single sentence, Mr. President, namely, that I may be informed, when the society have leisure—What I am? From whence I came—What the duce I came <HI>for</HI>—and what is to become of me when I am not permitted to stay here any longer?</P>
<P><HI>Registered.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="124"/>PHILOSOPHER THE THIRD.</P>
<P>Pray, Mr. President, let me be in∣formed how it is that I am able to <HI>think?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Registered.</HI></P>
<P>PHILOSOPHER THE FOURTH.</P>
<P>I am a philosopher upon the prin∣ciple of the profound yet modest Mr. Locke, and I should be glad to hear any man, Mr. President, in this assem∣bly have the hardy-hood to oppose his system. <HI>I</HI> say, Mr. President, with Mr. Locke, that I have always ex∣isted, that there are no such innate ideas—that I am free when I am able to act as I think proper—In short, I am a Lockist from top to bottom.</P>
<P><HI>Registered.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="125"/>PHILOSOPHER THE FIFTH.</P>
<P>Register me, Mr. President, if you please as a friend to Spinosa, and an enemy to every man who can support the futile arguments of Locke.</P>
<P><HI>Registered.</HI></P>
<P>PHILOSOPHER THE SIXTH.</P>
<P>My notion is, Mr. President, that the sublimest system in the world is that of the Bramins. I believe, im∣plicitly with them, that this wretched existence is only a death of a few years, which when passed, will be ex∣changed for a glorious state where we shall live for ever with the Deity. Mr. President, I beg you will permit me to be registered as a man who
<PB N="120" REF="126"/>means, tooth and nail, to support the Bramin opinions.</P>
<P><HI>Registered.</HI></P>
<P>PHILOSOPHER THE SEVENTH.</P>
<P>Down with me, Mr. President, as an Hobbist or Hobbesist, just, sir, as you choose to settle the orthography. For I hold, with Mr. Hobbes that, the great law of the world is the law of convention. I hold, that it is per∣fectly conformable to the law of nature that every man should have a right to take the life of a fellow-creature, because every man has <HI>a right to every thing.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Registered.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="127"/><HI>Whew,</HI> said Sir Matthew—carrying Matilda and his nephew out of the assembly.</P>
<P>PHILOSOPHER THE EIGHTH.</P>
<P>Mr. President, I am a follower of Aristotle.</P>
<P><HI>Registered.</HI></P>
<P>PHILOSOPHER THE NINTH.</P>
<P>It would make me happy, Mr. Pre∣sident, to know, in the course of the learned debates which are to be agi∣tated within these walls, what are really the philosophical and metaphy∣sical import of the following words, which I have so very often read about, without being a whit the wiser— namely—infinity, incomprehensibility, eternity, plastick forms, monades, rea∣son,
<PB N="122" REF="128"/>instinct, substance, ignorance and wisdom?</P>
<P><HI>Registered.</HI></P>
<P>PHILOSOPHER THE TENTH.</P>
<P>My principle, sir, is above all things, to take care of my parents; never to break my promise; to be abstemious; to doubt, when I am not certain of the propriety of an action; and to be as charitable as my fortune will per∣mit. Let me, therefore, be put down in the list as an admirer of Zoroaster. What are called his superstitions, Mr. President, I am ready and able to de∣fend. I do not admit that any of his dogmas were erroneous, but I will take upon me to prove that he is superior to every man that went before or shall come after him.</P>
<P><HI>Registered.</HI></P>

<P>PHILOSOPHER THE TWELFTH.</P>
<P>Mallebranche is my man, Mr. Pre∣sident, and I will enter the list with any gentleman of this society who will attempt to prove that pleasure is <HI>not</HI> able to make us happy.</P>
<P><HI>Registered.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="130"/>PHILOSOPHER THE THIRTEENTH.</P>
<P>The person who spoke last, Mr. President, will find a powerful anta∣gonist in <HI>me,</HI> for I profess the princi∣ples of Arnauld, and I do, with all the force that is in me, firmly <HI>deny</HI> that pleasure can make us happy.</P>
<P><HI>Registered.</HI></P>
<P>PHILOSOPHER THE FOURTEENTH.</P>
<P>I despise pleasure of all kinds, Mr. President; I have the greatest con∣tempt for pain; grief has no sort of influence either upon my soul or body: I scorn life; I scorn death. Insert me, therefore, as a man who will maintain the system of Epictetus, of Cato, and of every other illustrious STOICK like myself.</P>
<P><HI>Registered.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="131"/>PHILOSOPHER THE FIFTEENTH.</P>
<P>About eight and twenty years ago, Mr. President, I took up a book which lay snug in a corner of my uncle Purepuzzle's study, and I found it contain a religion, which I have ever since adopted. The great founder hereof, Mr. President, enjoins, that we should be modest and humiliated, that to do no harm is not sufficient, we must do good; he bids us pardon injuries and never forget benefits. To correct to day the faults of yesterday. To stand, as it were, sentinel over our own hearts. To cultivate every tenderness, and curb every passion; without pride or pageantry to bestow, and never to receive but in cases of
<PB N="126" REF="132"/>the last necessity, and then to accept a favour without stooping to meanness. I stand up then, Mr. President, and I will for the future stand up while I have a leg to stand <HI>upon,</HI> a warm ad∣vocate of Confucius.</P>
<P><HI>Registered.</HI></P>
<P>PHILOSOPHER THE SIXTEENTH.</P>
<P>I am one, Mr. President, who neither pin my faith upon the old tattered sleeve of Locke, Spinosa, Hobbes, Zoroaster, Epicurus, Mallebranche, Arnauld, Epictetus, or Confucius.</P>
<P>I do not care what these say the snap of my finger; because, superior to all leaders or leading-strings, Mr. President, I am a young fellow who thinks for myself. But, alas! I have
<PB N="127" REF="133"/>hitherto thought to so little purpose, that I am almost as much in the dark as if I had read the two and twenty thousand million philosophical books which, I understand, have been writ∣ten to explain what is, perhaps, after all incomprehensible. The subjects, Mr. President, which I want to have treated, are indeed such as foolish folks are in general afraid to enter upon; and therefore we have as yet no society which comes up to my idea of an academy of dispute: I hope <HI>this,</HI> Mr. President, (which is opened upon your <HI>Green</HI> under your suffrage) will be such. It is with these expec∣tations that I have come from the remotest part of Cornwall, to <HI>Shen∣stone-Green,</HI> where I will regularly
<PB N="128" REF="134"/>attend the debates of this honourable house till my soul is satisfied. Not, however, Mr. President, to take up more of your time than I perceive is, on the present evening, allowed to one person, I shall briefly direct my hints to the ear of Mr. Deputy that he may insert them in his treasury of metaphysical materials.</P>
<P>FIRST,</P>
<P>Let me be instructed how rea∣son differs, either externally or inter∣nally, from instinct, and upon what principle it is that every beast of the field hath so strong a sense of obe∣dience, gratitude, aversion and shame? I would wish to know if my dog hath not the faculty of combining and com∣paring? Does he think always or
<PB N="129" REF="135"/>does he never think? Does he—in fact, what is the precise difference betwixt him and your humble ser∣vant?</P>
<P>Here a general laugh ensued, pro∣duced partly by the droll manner of the present speaker, and partly by the singularity of his harangue.</P>
<P>SECONDLY,</P>
<P>I desire it may be debated whe∣ther human science is not a very ab∣surd thing, and whether the wisdom of the wisest sage is not foolish∣ness? I maintain, Mr. President, that it is neither convenient nor necessary for man to know much; and I suspect that we are every hour running our noses against matters that are wholly out of our line. Pray, therefore, let
<PB N="130" REF="136"/>me be told whether knowledge is necessary, or whether "ignorance is not bliss."</P>
<P>You have proposed questions enough, friend, said I, for at least a twelve∣month's debate, and I therefore ad∣vise, that you reserve the rest for more leisure, as it begins to get late.</P>
<P>The philosopher assented, and his questions were</P>
<P><HI>Registered.</HI></P>
<P>PHILOSOPHER THE SEVENTEENTH.</P>
<P>I should be glad to have it proved, Mr. President, at the very next meet∣ing, whether it would not be more politick, more moral, and more to the honour of <HI>Shenstone-Green</HI> to turn the Academy of Dispute into an Aca∣demy
<PB N="131" REF="137"/>for keeping pigs, suckling calves, breeding chickens or for any other use equally innocent, rather than suffer it to stand upon its present foundation?</P>
<P>Here a loud laugh burst from the multitude, and a growl muttered amongst the metaphysicians: but the speaker's question appeared to me so apposite that I ordered it to be</P>
<P><HI>Registered.</HI></P>
<P>PHILOSOPHER THE LAST.</P>
<P>Though I perceive, Mr. President, that the book of the deputy is about to be closed, I hope you will allow <HI>me,</HI> who am one of your regular pen∣sioners, and who have seen all the disorders of <HI>Shenstone-Green,</HI> from the

<P>TO avoid giving offence, Mr. President, to any of the worthy and learned gentlemen, who have this evening enriched the Academy with stores of religious and metaphy∣sical hints for future ratiocination, I shall not address them with any re∣marks of my <HI>own,</HI> but simply tell them a story which was told to me by <HI>a celebrated French philosopher;</HI> and which is, doubtless, as well known

<P>The story runs thus:
<Q><P>When the most powerful, saga∣cious and wise Deity had, in six days, put the finishing stroke to his work—no less a performance than that of composing the world— when he had properly arranged the heavenly bodies, adjusted the mu∣sick of the spheres, and fitted every star to its orbit: when the secret springs which moved and regulated this sublime machine were curiously concealed from the acutest exami∣ner, and when an impenetrable veil was thrown over the arcana of na∣ture;
<PB N="137" REF="141"/>it is said, that the great author of the whole, in the ineffa∣bility of his indulgence, amused himself with observing the progress of those ingenious little contrivers who call themselves PHILOSOPHERS.</P>
<P>To this end, says the story, he summoned all those who, on this speck of earth, had distinguished themselves as the founders or inven∣tors of any particular faith: sophists, doctors, and all the proud sons of harangue and disputation were there. Scot, Bonaventure, Gassendi, Tho∣mas of Aquin, Descartes and every other illustrious name which hath either been trusted to the wing of posterity, or dropped into the vale of oblivion.</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="142"/>They approached the star-in∣circled throne of the universal fa∣ther, who, considering them as they really were, stooped from his unri∣valled dignity, and conversed upon equal terms.</P>
<P>Lookee, my friends, let us see which of you hath the most intimate acquaintance with the governor of nature. Tell me what I am, how I am made, and what is my secret? Tell me by what force or manage∣ment the comets are sustained; and why in that globe upon which you once crawled, one ounce of good is, by a destiny too fatal, mixed up with fifty ounces of evil? When you have settled these points, you may, if you please, by way of sup∣plement
<PB N="139" REF="143"/>tell me, who and what you yourselves are. Speak freely.</P>
<P>It is a day of absolute liberty. Speak to me with the same confi∣dence you have spoken and written to your fellow-atoms. I am aware that prizes have been proposed by way of encouraging you to these matters. Be it so, I will, for once, adopt the rule of your academies, and give to him who shall offer the best and clearest idea, a great deal of money, and his salvation into the bargain.</P>
<P>He said, the philosophers ap∣plauded the proposal, and friend <HI>Thomas</HI> rose first—Thomas who always gets so well through the
<PB N="140" REF="144"/>thick and thin of an argument, and replies to every thing without hav∣ing a doubt of any thing.</P>
<P>Thou art, said he, the existence and the essence, the pure substance, and the simple attribute: thou wert <HI>in</HI> time, <HI>out</HI> of time, <HI>before</HI> time and after time; the beginning, the mid∣dle, and the end; the great princi∣ple, and the great effect; thou art present every where without being any where.</P>
<P>The eternal, at these words, said, courage noble Thomas, courage, and covered the natural <HI>awe</HI> of his coun∣tenance by a smile.</P>
<P>After some little bustle, <HI>Descartes</HI> got up—Descartes, who was ever in
<PB N="141" REF="145"/>search of the whirlwind that he could not meet with—whose head was, as it were, be-powdered with subtle matter, and who went blundering on without even having read so much as the Evangelist.</P>
<P>Since I am permitted to speak, said <HI>Descartes,</HI> behold an argument, which I take to be uncontrovertible. To <HI>be,</HI> it is enough that you are <HI>pos∣sible.</HI> With respect to your universe it is a striking thing enough; but, whenever you think proper, I will make quite another-guess-affair of it.</P>
<P>I am able—yes, I Descartes, am able to form elements, animals, light and whirlwinds, out of a
<PB N="142" REF="146"/>little piece of matter. Who knows the laws of motion so well as Descartes?</P>
<P>The Deity smiled with pity for the second time. Then rose the uncertain and hesitating <HI>Gassendi.</HI> He tremb∣lingly proposed to God his crooked atoms, although out of fashion, and decayed; but not venturing to say any thing of the supreme Essence, he stammered out a few more words about his crooked atoms and sat down.</P>
<P>Next stepped forth, with measured pace, a little, long-nosed Jew; poor, modest, happy, satisfied and retired. His complexion was pale, his under∣standing subtle—he was more cele∣brated
<PB N="143" REF="147"/>than read, and he concealed himself under the mantle of his mas∣ter Descartes.</P>
<P>Pardon me, said he—addressing himself to the throne, and speaking very low—pardon me—but I think, between ourselves, that you have no existence at all. This, do I believe, is proved by my mathematicks.</P>
<P>Some feeble schoolmen, and bad criticks have opposed me; but you are able to judge how far I have been in the right. You only are able to determine the limits of the genius of Spinosa.</P>
<P>The solid earth and azure heavens trembled at these words with horror
<PB N="144" REF="148"/>and affright. Thomas of Aquin stepped back: all the philosophers looked alarmed; but the clement and good Deity, lamented the infidelity of Spinosa, ordered his poor brain to be cured, and gently commanded that he should be ex∣cluded from the senate of science.</P>
<P>Spinosa withdrew under the sup∣port of a few partizans.</P>
<P>Our philosophers, perceiving with what unbounded indulgence the Deity deigned to compassionate their extravagances, immediately held out in oftentatious pomp an hundred fair chimeras, and noble efforts of the human understanding. They spoke, disputed, opposed, supported,
<PB N="145" REF="149"/>cried and shouted all together. The heavens and the earth were in an uproar.</P>
<P>Chaos was come again. Thus, when to dine with some withered witch of a woman who erects her reputation upon feeding men of letters, fifteen or twenty <HI>beaux esprits,</HI> family authors, rhymsters, com∣pilers, song-makers, and translators are gathered together, the house re∣echoes with the howlings of the hungry rabble, and the wandering passengers stand gaping in the street.</P>
<P>And now uprose with a conscious air, the redoubted <HI>Mallebranche.</HI> Speak to the <HI>letter,</HI> speak to the <HI>word,</HI> and then I will answer, said
<PB N="146" REF="150"/>he. In opposition to him, <HI>Arnauld</HI> started from his seat, and furiously said, that, the Sovereign Bounty created the human race propensely to damn it. <HI>Leibnitz</HI> announced to the Turk and the Christian, that in his Harmony they would not be able to comprehend his meaning, that God, the world, and us little creeping creatures are nothing with∣out <HI>Monades.</HI> Every philosopher discovered his system, and sported his opinion.</P>
<P>The Deity by no means enraged— he is the best of fathers—permitted his children, without imposing laws too rigid, to amuse themselves like libertines as they were, with the work
<PB N="147" REF="151"/>of his hands. But, as none of them had answered the questions quite to his satisfaction, he put off the prize to another year.</P>
<P>On the very same day, however (continues the tale) he dispatched his Angel Gabriel the ambassador of peace —the firm friend of pure hearts, and the messenger of good actions—with a particular commission down to earth. Immediately the winged agent took a flight into twenty provinces, and paid a visit to saints, popes, princes, car∣dinals, and inquisitors, most of whom were, in past ages, devout perse∣cutors.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, said he, the benign Father of all Mercies, orders you to
<PB N="148" REF="152"/>divert yourselves without oppressing any other person. Be happy your∣selves, but do not make others miserable. He knows very well that there are a set of pretenders in in the world—a kind of literary em∣pyricks, very wise and very pro∣found— who are, like yourselves, egregrious blockheads. But as they have neither the power nor the will to do any harm, the good God my master is too full of compassion to arm his omnipotence against the im∣becillity of flesh and blood.</P>
<P>Because poor atoms, who have a glimmering faculty of thinking, think wrong, ought they to be roasted for that? Alas! human philosophy is of such a nature that one should
<PB N="149" REF="153"/>not too rigidly mark what it doeth amiss. Believe me, the book of a metaphysician is no very dangerous matter. As it is born so dieth it in feebleness. The arguments, which ye can make use of against the Most High, are as arrows shot from a loosened bow that is pulled by the arm of an infant. They must needs drop short of their mark. And when that mark is the glorious majesty of earth and heaven, judge how very wretched must be your most aspiring attempts!</P>
<P>To talk and to scribble is the pri∣vilege of the thing which hath most vanity, and the least reason to be vain.</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="154"/>Imitate your tender father who doth nothing but smile and for∣give.</P></Q></P>
<P>Here ends my story, Mr. President, and it is now easy to determine whose system is the best.</P>

<PB N="151" REF="155"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. LIX. PHILOSOPHY CONTRIBUTETH TO THE DESTRUCTION OF SHENSTONE-GREEN.</HEAD>
<P>THE whole assembly was up in arms at this story, at the rela∣tion of which I perfectly shuddered.</P>
<P>The philosophers deemed it ab∣surd.</P>
<P>The wits applauded it as a fine morsel of <HI>fun.</HI></P>
<P>The auditors, in general, declared it was impious and profane. But the
<PB N="152" REF="156"/>murmurs of the partizans so violently increased, that I rose with indignation from my chair, and darting a look of contempt at the story-teller, went out of the Academy exclaiming, that I neither liked the institution nor the principles on which it was to move; and that they should never meet with my concurrence till they were likely to be conducted more to the honour of my <HI>Village,</HI> my COUNTRY and my GOD.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding these declarations, the disputants went on with all the vigour and violence of bigotted con∣troversy; and the passion for declaim∣ing grew to such a size that it seemed to lord it over every other. It was
<PB N="153" REF="157"/>in vain that I combated this with all the little authority I had left myself; I argued upon the score of its involv∣ing us in religious dissentions, the fatal effects of which I pathetically pointed out. In reply to this, they insisted that it was curtailing a gene∣rous liberty, and inflicting upon them a scandalous servitude, which implied a desire to tyrannize: and how, said they, can Sir Benjamin Beauchamp pretend to forbid those establishments taking place in a free village, which have always flourished in all large and polished cities. TO THINK, they said, characterized men much less than to give <HI>language</HI> to thought. Speech was, in their opinion, the cardinal distinction of humanity, and if <HI>Shen∣stone-Green</HI>
<PB N="154" REF="158"/>was not, above all other villages or towns upon earth, the pro∣perest for fair and full debate, they did not conceive rightly the idea of the liberty of Sir Benjamin's subjects.</P>
<P>In proportion as I resisted, the phi∣losophers preached up with vehe∣mence the tolerating spirit, and when my consent was by no means to be gained to the contrivance of the Sys∣tematick Academy, the members pub∣lickly told me, that I had no power to repeal an act I had voluntarily made; and that as I had no right to tax the human understanding, they should proceed in the investigation of truth, though to get at her temple it might be necessary to shake the very
<PB N="155" REF="159"/>roof of the Academy with the solid powers of a metaphysical argument.</P>
<P>Thus, obliged to give up the point, the meetings became so frequent that the folly spread itself about till it fairly begirt my unfortunate village like a surrounding pestilence. In a little time all sorts of religionists, sects, and system-mongers crept into a com∣munity sufficiently divided before. Parties were formed and sustained with an animosity which denoted the most inveterate prejudice and hatred of each other: some combated for the Epicurean, some for the Platonick system; and it was no uncommon thing to see a number of my people gathered together to observe fair fight∣ing,
<PB N="156" REF="160"/>with tongue and fist, betwixt a Stoick and a Sceptick; a Materialist and a Roman Catholick, a Bramin and a Spinosian. The infection pre∣sently ran to Tradesmen's-Corner, and my mechanicks first hurried their work, and then fairly left it, to get to the Academy. Many of them, who had weak heads and strong lungs, were exalted, by the force of such accomplishments, from hearers to speakers; and by such means, those who were formerly honest men, and industrious traders—who were, per∣haps, raised from the hard fall of unavoidable bankruptcy, or set up newly in the shops I had provided— turned out blind enthusiasts, or absurd religionists, each of whom had just
<PB N="157" REF="161"/>knowledge as well as just religion enough to make them enemies, but not enough to make them friends.</P>
<P>In short, <HI>Shenstone-Green</HI> was now in an uproar both from civil and re∣ligious misfortunes. It was miserably divided against itself, and you may be sure, reader, the total subversion of my little empire was not far off.</P>
<P>The New Paradise was fairly LOST.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. LX. AGREEABLE EVENTS, AND MUCH INNOCENCE.</HEAD>
<P>DURING these absurdities amongst the <HI>greater part</HI> of the inhabi∣tants, the better <HI>few</HI> were labouring to compensate for the disorders of less worthy spirits. Affairs stood thus: Sir Matthew Davies was exerting every tender manoeuvre to form his nephew to a regular system of moral and steady conduct.</P>
<P>Henceforth, my dear Danvers, said the baronet, consider, that the esta∣blished
<PB N="159" REF="163"/>gentleman is too well acquaint∣ed with sinery to regard it.</P>
<P>As we now tread poetical ground, which is, perhaps, built on the most romantick passage in the works of William Shenstone, I will give you a maxim more reasonable from that author.</P>
<Q><HI>Have an</HI> heart superior, <HI>with</HI> oeconomy suita∣ble <HI>to your fortune.</HI></Q>
<P>But I have said enough: my ne∣phew, continued Sir Matthew, will be worthy the love of Matilda Beau∣champ.</P>
<P>Mr. Sidney and Miss Elliot were engaged in little bickerings, which did not affect their mutual tender∣ness.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="164"/>Mr. Elixir was perfectly happy in trundling his wife over the <HI>Green</HI> in her gilt go-cart.</P>
<P>Henry Hewit, as he was the best, so was he the most blest of men in the arms of his now saithful Fanny.</P>
<P>Hackney Oldblade was blessing his good stars even for the loss of his limbs in the field of battle, since it was to the wounds there occasioned, he was indebted for his present feli∣city—Had not I been thus gloriously mangled, said the veteran, I should never have travelled upon my stumps to <HI>Shenstone-Green,</HI> nor ever have found my daughter.</P>
<P>The generous expences which the above parties had incurred on account
<PB N="161" REF="165"/>of young Davies, were all adjust∣ed.</P>
<P>In the midst of these circumstances Mr. Sarcasm, the steward, sent me the following letter, which not a little disconcerted me.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD><HI>To Sir</HI> BENJAMIN BEAUCHAMP.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY WORTHY MASTER.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN very sorrow of foul I set me down at my desk to tell your Ho∣nour that we must needs part. for the business of <HI>the Green</HI> does so blacken and thicken that it is too much for a man in years, who has, till lately, lived in a land properly secured by wife and salutary laws.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="166"/>Pray, your Honour, think a little of the life I am leading. There are more petitions pass through these my feeble hands than if I were a Lord Chancellor, and every petitioner, who does not succed, honours me with abusive language. But, waving this point, there are others which render mine office at this place insupporta∣ble, and with which it behoveth your Honour to be made acquainted.</P>
<P><HI>Shenstone-Green</HI> is, by being built after a wrong model—your Honour will pardon me—become the most reprobate and disagreeable place I know.</P>
<P>We are over-run with lawyers, peace officers, and usurers, who have
<PB N="163" REF="167"/>scented their prey even in this once still corner of Wales.</P>
<P>We have no religion, no manners, and people are every hour buying an ounce of justice with a ton of gold. Nor do I in troth think your Ho∣nour has any further occasion for a steward in this village, for pension∣ers are every day leaving their shells behind them, <HI>i. e.</HI> vacating your Honour's houses, and those who remain imagine their patron to have so little authority, that it is only for the sake of preserving ap∣pearances that they teaze him with petitions.</P>
<P>These truths, sir, added to the great objection I have to babble and
<PB N="164" REF="168"/>noise, urge me to hope you will gently dismiss me from a post which can be no longer held with service to your honour, nor credit to</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your peace-loving Faithful humble servant, SAMUEL SARCASM.</SIGNED>
<DATELINE><HI>Steward's-Lodge.</HI></DATELINE></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>On reading this letter to Sir Mat∣thew Davies, he said, he must have some conversation with Sarcasm, and begged he might be sent for.</P>
<P>While these orders were giving, an express arrived at the Mansion-house for Sir Matthew, who received a small chest, and a large packet of Letters. One of these, said he, ex∣amining
<PB N="165" REF="169"/>the hand, so particularly concerns me that I must retire to read it.</P>
<P>He withdrew to the next room, beckoning his nephew to follow him.</P>
<P>Matilda and I were alone.</P>
<P>Hang it, papa, said she, this <HI>Shen∣stone-Green</HI> is but a poor place after all.</P>
<P>A very poor place, indeed, Ma∣tilda.</P>
<P>Lord, Lord, how much better had I been feeding my linnets, nursing my sick canary, and driving the kite from my chickens, in Cumberland!</P>
<P>Heigho, Matilda!</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="170"/>And yet, papa, it has its charms too. I am sure I love this flower that I have got in my hand ten thousand times better than all the flowers that ever grew in Cumberland.</P>
<P>How long is it, my dear, since Sir Matthew's nephew went into the gar∣den and cut with your scissars—</P>
<P>Pshaw—now you think, papa, that I like the flower upon that account— Now, I protest—</P>
<P>But this village, my dear, I declare it is grown detestable to me.</P>
<P>Oh! I hate it so, papa, I never desire to set my foot in it again.</P>
<P>I thought, Matilda, you said just now that it had more charms than—</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="171"/>No; not <HI>Shenstone-Green,</HI> sir, I meant this house, and that garden, and the wood, and the little bench in the alcove, where there is scarce room enough for—for—</P>
<P>Sir Matthew's nephew and you I suppose, Matilda—Hey!</P>
<P>Lord, papa, your head runs of nothing but Sir Matthew's nephew.</P>
<P>But since we are alone Matilda, let me frankly confess to you, that I blush to think how deep I have plunged my fortune in a foolish scheme, and in∣jured thereby my dear Matilda. Through my absurdity, my dear, you will not have near so much money as you ought to have had.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="172"/>Then I shall have less occasion for it you know, papa, for Danvers will be a good oeconomist—</P>
<P>Danvers, did you say, Matilda?—</P>
<P>Yes, papa, and I do assure you, he yesterday declared to me upon his knees—</P>
<P>Upon his knees, Matilda?</P>
<P>Yes, yes, I say, he declared upon both his knees, while he put up his dear white hands, thus, and laid his sweet cheek to my face—</P>
<P>His cheek to your face, Matilda?</P>
<P>—Just for all the world as it might be thus—</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="173"/>Lord, papa, how rough your skin is to his—well, and he swore that since his last visit to the Mansion-house, he valued one shilling more than ever he did a guinea before.—</P>
<P>Do you indeed, said I, Danvers; I do by my soul, replied he, I do by this kiss.</P>
<P>By this kiss, Matilda, did you say?</P>
<P>Kiss, papa, why if you had seen him kiss me that time, it was so differ∣ent from every other—</P>
<P>Every <HI>other,</HI> Matilda?</P>
<P>That you never could have forgot it—for the tears fell upon the poor
<PB N="170" REF="174"/>things face, and there was so much grief about his eyes, and his dear lips turned so pale, that I thought we should have both died upon the spot.</P>
<P>Then you love him, Matilda, more than ever. To be sure I do, papa, and is not there good reason for it? Is not Danvers quite a tame, gentle creature, and don't he love me with all his soul?</P>
<P>But if after all, Matilda, he should gain your affections and then prove faithless.</P>
<P>Then, papa, will I be so good humoured and so faithful, that I will touch his fine heart and win him back again.</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="175"/>You are resolved then to have him, Matilda, at all events.</P>
<P>I would make myself very misera∣ble to please my father.</P>
<P>Come to your father's arms—your father's heart, Matilda, for you are dearer to me than—</P>
<P>Here, Sir Matthew and his nephew, who were in the next room rush∣ed in.</P>
<P>Not dearer, Benjamin, cried Sir Matthew, to you than she is to me, and you are not much more her relation.</P>
<P>Don't suppose you have a greater share of her than myself.</P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="176"/>Lookee, nephew, if you do not promise me to make it Matilda's <HI>duty</HI> to call me uncle, by this day week, I will leave you and this house with a <HI>Whew.</HI>—</P>
<P>Oh! my God, said young Davies, what shall I do! Why do my tears refuse to relieve me in this excess of my happiness!</P>
<P>Suppose, Matilda, said I, you and Mr. Davies were to go and court the stars this fine evening, as you sit on the little bench in the alcove where there is scarce room for two persons.</P>
<P>That, papa, said Matilda, slyly, would incommode the young gentle∣man, but as it is your desire, we
<PB N="173" REF="177"/>should take advantage of so heavenly a night, it would be rude not to—</P>
<P>Well said, hypocrite (cried Sir Mat∣thew, as Matilda was going out) you will spoil my nephew, I doubt, at last.</P>

<PB N="174" REF="178"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. LXI. A PROPOSAL FOR THE NEW-MODEL∣LING OF SHENSTONE-GREEN.</HEAD>
<P>BY this time entered Mr. Samuel Sarcasm in obedience to the summons.</P>
<P>And so, Mr. Samuel, said Sir Mat∣thew, you would wish to quit the <HI>Green?</HI></P>
<P>Your Honours both know my reasons, replied the steward.</P>
<P>To tell you the truth, my friend, said Sir Matthew, I am as tired of it
<PB N="175" REF="179"/>as yourself, and I think I may answer for Sir Benjamin into the bargain. Say the truth, Sir Benjamin, is not your frolick over? Are you not convinced that Master Shenstone and you have only started a project, whose execution hath "furnished inconve∣niencies proper only for a lively novel."</P>
<P>I am indeed, said I, groaning forth my profound conviction.</P>
<P>That being the case, answered Sir Matthew, suppose we make the best of a bad necessity, and turn as much as possible our misfortune to advan∣tage.</P>
<P>Surely, said I.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="180"/>Putting up, therefore, with the loss of the several irrecoverable pen∣sions, and the sums that have been jerked away upon other subjects equally useless, I have a plan to settle every thing else on a decent footing.</P>
<P>Heavens, said I, what plan is that?</P>
<P>FIRST,</P>
<P>Let your traders live here as in any other town, continuing to work and sell to the best advantage they can. If they are rich enough to cock-fight, let them cock-fight; but, at all events, let them pay a trifling yearly rent to you for their houses, which, if they choose to <HI>quit,</HI>
<PB N="177" REF="181"/>so much the better; then you may get better tenants; if they like to stay, so be it. They will know the conditions: if they are insolent com∣pel them into civility by law.</P>
<P>And must <HI>Shenstone-Green</HI> come to this? said I.</P>
<P>It must come to this or worse, re∣plied Sir Matthew.</P>
<P>In troth, your Honour whistles my tune to a T, cried Samuel, smiling.</P>
<P>SECONDLY,</P>
<P>Let you, I, and Samuel, continued Sir Matthew, buy, if it is to be done cheaply, all the publick buildings which stand upon your ground, Sir Benjamin, and let us convert them into the following uses: viz.</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="182"/>The Concert-Room into a Charity-House for poor Welch orphans, to be educated and clothed at our expence till the age of twelve years.</P>
<P>The Pantheon, into a Free-School for boys.</P>
<P>The Theatre into an Alms-House for all old people past labour.</P>
<P>Humph! cried Samuel, a little costively, this note does not suit my organs, your Honour, quite so well as the last.</P>
<P>THIRDLY,</P>
<P>Let such pensioners houses as are vacated be let to any body who chooses to hire them, and <HI>Shenstone-Green</HI> is become too popular not to attract
<PB N="179" REF="183"/>inhabitants. The profits of these may go towards the maintenance of the charities. It would be well to cultivate commerce and invite all people to settle in this village, which may be easily done if the grand articles of life come cheap to them at first setting out.</P>
<P>Samuel shook his head.</P>
<P>FOURTHLY,</P>
<P>Let matters, said Sir Matthew, go on just as they will, do you take care, Sir Benjamin, to be paid for every thing that is claimable; and I charge you to let the laws take their course for the future from one corner of <HI>Shenstone-Green</HI> to the other.</P>
<P>But how, Sir Matthew, said I, are all these things to be done. I have
<PB N="180" REF="184"/>laid out already an immense sum of money, and must continue to pay off those cursed annuities.</P>
<P>Read that letter then, answered Sir Matthew.</P>
<LETTER>

<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR SIR MATTHEW,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Your wandering whim has not injured your fortunes, for I con∣sidered your interest as mine, and have looked vigilantly after every thing that belonged to Sir Matthew Davies, while he was humourously vagabonding it as Mr. Seabrooke. Your immense adventures which you hazarded abroad are returned safe, with such cargoes and freights as must swell your large fortune into almost an immensity. The success of a cer∣tain
<PB N="181" REF="185"/>baronet, who traded to the Indian shores, is this very day blazing in the papers, so that your presence becomes necessary, as, indeed, nothing effectual can be done with∣out you. It is well your travelling name is no longer necessary, for it is so proper for you to come to town, and assume your real self, that had <HI>Shenstone-Green</HI> been really a paradise instead of a mere mortal village, built with mens hands, and polluted by mens vices, you could not consistently have delayed your departure. Your captains will all want you in ten days, which must be the very longest date of your absence from London.</P>

<P>I HOLD <HI>that,</HI> reader, to be a vil∣lainous drawback upon thy plea∣sure, which delays, unnecessarily, the concluding events of an interesting book.

<P><PB N="184" REF="188"/>Understand, therefore, that the plan of Sir Matthew, was, with the amend∣ments of Mr. Samuel, put into exe∣cution without delay.</P>
<P>The traders were obliged to submit and <HI>Shenstone-Green</HI> shrunk down to a village, <HI>as villages go.</HI></P>
<P>Not worse nor better; not any longer romantick, but real.</P>
<P>The charities were all instituted, and all that part of Wales, you will naturally believe, was the better for them.</P>
<P>Samuel Sarcasm remained still the steward but upon a very different principle.</P>
<P>He is to let the premises to the best advantage.</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="189"/>Shouldest <HI>thou,</HI> reader, choose to become a tenant, it is only necessary for thee to take a journey into Gla∣morganshire, and make the best bar∣gain thou art able with my old friend Samuel.</P>
<P>In that thou art an admirer and purchaser of this book, he will, I doubt not, be the more favourable to thee.</P>
<P>But should mere curiosity lead thee to see this celebrated town, thou hast only to find it out, and gratify thine heart.</P>
<P>Shouldest thou be so lucky as to hit upon the spot, fail not to say to thy∣self. Alas, poor SHENSTONE-GEEEN! Alas, poor HUMAN NATURE!</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. LXIII. CONTAINING WHAT YOU MIGHT EXPECT.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE settled all the business of the last chapter while Sir Matthew was dressing himself for a ceremony which there can be no one so ignorant as not to guess.</P>
<P>Thou seest, reader, the whole re∣maining matters before thee; and, it may be, thou expectest a very fine description of silks, sattins, and soft sayings.</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="191"/>How wilt thou be mistaken! for, my good friend, I shall only take thee by the hand into the largest room of the Mansion-house, and present thee to Mr. Davies and my Matilda, with Mr. Sidney and his Eliza, each of whom thou mayest, should it so please thee, wish much joy on their <HI>marriage.</HI> In the middle of the room thou wilt pay thy compliments to Mrs. Elixir, who is sitting in her chair of state; and to her husband the apothe∣cary, who is crying very heartily for happiness. Possibly, thou wilt on the other side, like to make thy bow— and I desire thee to make it with re∣verence—to the gentle Fanny Hewit and her spouse; Sir Matthew Davies will meet thine eye dressed for once
<PB N="188" REF="192"/>like himself, and Samuel Sarcasm, who is tatling in the corner to Master Hackney Oldblade, will not pass thy attention if thou hast really any seri∣ous thoughts of visiting <HI>Shenstone-Green.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. LXIV. WHICH IS MORE THAN WAS BARGAINED FOR.</HEAD>
<P>THE moral to be adduced from this work, is, clearly, to prove the absolute chimera of forming any society which is to associate any num∣ber of people to enjoy one man's bene∣faction under the eye of the benefac∣tor. It is impossible to introduce restricting regulations amongst men who expect that a favour should be as delicate as it is generous; so that no such societies can exist without be∣ing thrown into disorder.</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="194"/>The benefactor may, indeed, make restrictions, but he is, upon the <HI>Shen∣stonian</HI> principle, in too nice a situation to enforce their practice; thus his lenity will produce evils which he can∣not punish; and his severity and in∣dulgence are equally dangerous.</P>
<P>It therefore follows, that good order amongst men can be expected only under the check of governments, where wealth and preferment depend on the industry and care of every single indi∣vidual; where the interest of one is deeply involved in that of another; where hope, fear, desire, and gratifica∣tion, and all the chain of tumultuous and gentle passions are excited by due degrees; so that any excess in either is not with impunity to infringe the
<PB N="191" REF="195"/>rights of a neighbour; where few are <HI>overladen with obligation,</HI> but every man struggles for a little, so that ob∣ligations are pretty equally given and bestowed; and where, in fine, there is a regular code of laws, which pervades the empire, and provides equably re∣ward and punishment to guard the privileges of one man from the viola∣tions of another.</P>
