Now, during the races, I'll give you a seat at the table d'Hote, and put money in your pocket to pay your reckoning, if you'll only entertain the company
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>with a funny song and a comical story. Oh! a good song at the end of a bottle is an excellent thing, and of great service to a house.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Henry.</SPEAKER>
<P>There was; but guidde by the weakness of her sex, and the arts of ours, he prevailed on her to set out for this country. I overtook them at Rochester, and demanded (perhaps too rashly) repa∣ration
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>of my sister's honor by an immediate mar∣riage. He refused. Pistols were the umpire. He lost his life; and the coroner's verdict has made mine doubtful if sound in England.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Henry.</SPEAKER>
<P>I brought her to France, and left her at the convent at Villeneuve. But to say the truth, I'm here at Fontainbleau in quest of a lady I fell in love with at the Sunday opera at Paris.

I'll pay forfeit, and after the race we'll meet and share the cash like ho∣nest fellows.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Casey.</SPEAKER>
<P>Civiler waiters! Upon my conscience, the lads are civil enough. Why don't you pay your score, and get out of my house, spunging upon my best customers, and strutting about in their old cloaths

<SPEAKER>Lark.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'm the best customer you have. There is not a table in your house, on which I have not left the mark of a dice box. Is there a morning I don't or∣der a Sandwich, or a day I don't drink my four bot∣tles after dinner?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Colonel.</SPEAKER>
<P>I never will behave myself, damme!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lack.</SPEAKER>
<P>Colonel Epaulette, let me entreat you to leave off attempting the blunt honesty of the English. It only transforms your countrymen into brutes. The attempt is as ridiculous as for the rough English to ape the customs and manners of the French, where we ever miss the mark, and polish into puppies.</P>
</SP>

<P>Well, you made the bets, when shall we share?</P>

<SPEAKER>Sir Shenkin.</SPEAKER>
<P>No! I paid forfeit. Joan did walk over the course.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Henry.</SPEAKER>
<P>And did you suppose I could behave so contemptible to join in such a scheme?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Shenkin.</SPEAKER>
<P>It's fery well; you shan't have my
<PB N="73" REF="72"/>sister. Look you, I do desire that you will never speak to, look at, or think of Celia again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Henry.</SPEAKER>
<P>Look you, Sir Shenkin, if you don't imme∣diately pay me the five thousand you laid me, and give your consent to my marrying your sister, I'll refer your conduct to the jockey club; and 'tis so notorious, that you'll not only be excluded the turf here, but at every race in England.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, my little Welchman, I am afraid you'll be posted at Tattersall's.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Shenkin.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'm nick'd, sous'd and slamm'd. Here, take my sister Celia. I'll back him against the field; for he has tricked me that have nicked hundreds.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Henry.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir Shenkin, this is the first good I ever knew derived from gaming. For what sensation must that man be capable of, that builds upon the misery of others; and raises a fortune on the ruin and bank∣ruptcy of his fellow-creatures!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Shenkin.</SPEAKER>
<P>It may be so; but as I set out a young pigeon, I'm resolved to die an old rook.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>But how shall I get this rook out of my pigeon-house?</P>

<P>Vell, monsieur Lackland, I have procured you a commission in my regiment; and 'tis much at your service.</P>
</SP>

<P>I thank you, Monsieur; but while I can raise the price of a drumstick, I'll never pull a trigger or draw a sword against my native country.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Bravo! my boy. Give me your hand. And at dinner time you shall never want a nail in my parlour to hang your hat on. You shall post my ledger, and drive a gig.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lack.</SPEAKER>
<P>Gig! Why you shall ride in a vis-a-vis, to the amazement of all Garlick hill.</P>

<P>And look you, for all your under∣minings and circumventings, if you whip your tom∣tit down to Chychwechlyn, I'll give you a haunch of rock venison, and a pottle to wash it down.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Rock venison!—Oh! he'll give you the leg of a goat.—Well now; as we seem now to be all tolerable good friends, we'll retire to the inn— <STAGE>(Lady Bull locks)</STAGE> Hotel I mean, where English hos∣pitality shall receive the zest of French claret.— Heigh! what say you to that, my antigallican son∣in-law?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lack.</SPEAKER>
<P>With all my heart. But, sir, I'll have no illiberal prejudices in my family. National reflections are unworthy the breast of an Englishman; and how∣ever in war each may vindicate his country's honour. in peace let us not know a distance but the streights of Dover.</P>
