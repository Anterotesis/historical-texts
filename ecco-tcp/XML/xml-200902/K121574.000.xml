<HEAD>THE PATRIOT ENTERPRIZE.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>ONE Briton yet asserts that aweful name,</L>
<L>One Patriot yet supports the glorious theme!</L>
<L>Amidst Corruption's flood still spotless seen,</L>
<L>A heart still faithful, and a hand still clean.</L>
<L>Assist him, Seraphs, stoop from heav'n ye few</L>
<L>That once were Patriots, once were firm and true</L>
<L>To Britain's cause, ye kindred Spirits glow,</L>
<L>Descend, and shield him in this storm below;</L>
<L>Your shelt'ring wings around his virtue spread,</L>
<L>Inspire his heart, and crown with wreaths his head;</L>
<L>With gleams of Heav'n's pure light his soul array,</L>
<L>And all the glories of the Just display</L>
<L>Full in his sight; parental Heroes smile;</L>
<L>His virtue aid—O snatch from fate this Isle;</L>
<L>Point out the paths you trod, the arms you bore,</L>
<L>Bid Truth return, and ancient worth restore;</L>
<L>Let Britain lift once more her laurel'd head</L>
<L>Above the waves, and strike the world with dread.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thou, PITT, this verse with patient soul attend,</L>
<L>Her buckler, sword, her guardian, and her friend;</L>
<L>Whose stedfast heart no virtuous toil can tire,</L>
<L>Whose tongue is touch'd with Heav'n's resistless fire,</L>
<L>In Heav'ns own injur'd cause supreme to shine</L>
<L>With dazzling force, with splendors all divine.</L>
<L>Thou Man belov'd! thy country's boast and choice,</L>
<L>To whom afflicted millions lift their voice,</L>
<L>Thou last remaining champion of the state,</L>
<L>On thee Integrity and Wisdom wait,</L>
<L>Still lift thy dreaded arm, still, still pursue</L>
<L>The monstrous Python, and his pois'nous crew;</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="3"/>
Repeat each righteous blow, repeat each wound,</L>
<L>And bring the bloated Hydra to the ground:</L>
<L>Lo earth, and sea, and heav'n shall then rejoice,</L>
<L>In one triumphant Paean lift their voice.</L>
<L>The marks of gratitude, ye Britons, pay,</L>
<L>And strew with thankful wreaths the Patriot's way;</L>
<L>Let breathing brass, let feeling stone confess,</L>
<L>Whilst arches bend, and story'd piles express</L>
<L>To ages yet unborn the glorious Man,</L>
<L>His falling country's prop, whose godlike plan</L>
<L>On curs'd Corruption trod, on Faction fell,</L>
<L>Who drives th' infernal monsters back to hell,</L>
<L>Spurning their gilded bait—who strikes down Fraud,</L>
<L>At home our bosom pest, our bane abroad,</L>
<L>That sap'd the vitals of our sinking pow'r,</L>
<L>When hungry Vengeance urg'd the rip'ning hour:</L>
<L>Then stood forth PITT, unaided and alone,</L>
<L>The People's friend, yet faithful to the Throne;</L>
<L>Trampling on British bribes with Roman scorn,</L>
<L>Another TULLY for his country born,</L>
<L>To counterwork each villain's dark designs,</L>
<L>For Britain too may dread her CATILINES:</L>
<L>He comes exulting in a heart sincere,</L>
<L>A tongue that strikes Corruption's soul with fear;</L>
<L>An arm still ready to redress the cause</L>
<L>Of Majesty oppress'd, or injur'd Laws;</L>
<L>Like CECIL bold in Virtue's sacred might,</L>
<L>Like HAMPDEN glorious, when restrain'd by right,</L>
<L>Like FAULKLAND servid for his country's good,</L>
<L>No pride provokes, no faction fires his blood;</L>
<L>For Britain's lasting weal his wishes glow,</L>
<L>His Patriot heart see pant, his blood see flow:</L>
<L>Embrace him, Britain, to thy bosom press</L>
<L>One Patriot Son, long, long that Son possess.</L>
<L>O quickly come, thou Genius that sustains</L>
<L>Of Britain's ancient worth the small remains,</L>
<L>O quickly come, and kindle up those fires</L>
<L>With Freedom's breath that warm'd our godlike sires;</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="4"/>
The bless'd occasion snatch, perhaps the last,</L>
<L>And round your liberties a rampart cast,</L>
<L>That shall, like Nature's laws, remain entire,</L>
<L>Till Virtue darkens and the stars expire;</L>
<L>Th' immortal task begin; see Virtue rise,</L>
<L>And lift her glorious flag to Britain's eyes;</L>
<L>Leaning on PITT her dreaded sword she draws,</L>
<L>Whilst angels trumpet wide th' eternal cause:</L>
<L>See panting millions to her standard crowd;</L>
<L>See Truth assert, see Faith proclaim aloud</L>
<L>The grand behest—from heav'n the sound is spread</L>
<L>(Whilst crush'd Integrity uprears her head.)</L>
<L>Britons, be honest to yourselves, be just,</L>
<L>In this unblemished man repose your trust;</L>
<L>PITT the firm phalanx forms with manly pride,</L>
<L>Integrity his shield, and Truth his guide;</L>
<L>See, see each venal pest before him fly,</L>
<L>Shrink from his voice, and shudder at his eye;</L>
<L>Such heav'n-fraught powers appal the guilty soul,</L>
<L>Where vengeance lightens, and where thunders roll;</L>
<L>Dreadful he marches on, and void of fear,</L>
<L>With Fortitude his front, with Worth his rear;</L>
<L>With every virtue see his soul supply'd,</L>
<L>With Loyalty, with Honour near his side;</L>
<L>Auxiliars worthy of a cause design'd</L>
<L>To rescue Nature's right in human kind:</L>
<L>From venal leprosy to purge the land,</L>
<L>And all the taints of soul Corruption's hand;</L>
<L>To push the barrier back that Freedom braves,</L>
<L>To mark the bounds of subjects, not of slaves,</L>
<L>To call up British honesty once more,</L>
<L>And ev'ry virtue to its reign restore.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ye Britons join with heart, with voice unite,</L>
<L>'Tis Wisdom calls you forth, and native Right;</L>
<L>Let future deeds your present crimes efface,</L>
<L>Your fleets and armies that bring back disgrace,</L>
<L>Council's o'erthrown by Caution's ghastly dreams,</L>
<L>Orders rejected, unattempted schemes;</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="5"/>
O biot—for ever blot the hateful page,</L>
<L>Quick cancel, Time, the ignominious age</L>
<L>From out thy records —See, a train appears!</L>
<L>Of British worthies, and of glorious years!</L>
<L>See Time (by Virtue led) o'er Albion smile,</L>
<L>Returning Justice bless once more the isle;</L>
<L>Exulting Commerce issuing from the main,</L>
<L>And Britain's thunder shake the poles again:</L>
<L>See Truth ascend her adamantine throne,</L>
<L>Despotic Truth, eternal, and alone;</L>
<L>Parent of Wisdom, whose unbounded sway</L>
<L>The Virtues bend to and the Worlds obey;</L>
<L>Great queen of harmony, whence order springs,</L>
<L>Whose moral scepter rules the hearts of kings,</L>
<L>Before thy throne with Concord's emblems grac'd,</L>

<L>Hail, sacred Truth, O stretch thy ancient reign</L>
<L>O'er Britain's kindred isle, call back again</L>
<L>Her golden age of plenty, pow'r and wealth,</L>
<L>Her honour, temperance, fortitude and health,</L>
<L>Her justice, courage, conquest and renown,</L>
<L>Let tyrants start, and tremble at her frown,</L>
<L>New brace her arm, her trident's strength restore,</L>
<L>Hark! hark! her thunder shakes yon hostile shore;</L>
<L>Around the globe her dreaded flag display,</L>
<L>Let ocean's utmost bounds her flag obey;</L>
<L>Her crimson cross invincible let fly</L>
<L>Above the waves, triumphant in the sky.</L>
<L>'Tis done; see direful Fraud, see Discord bound,</L>
<L>See hell-born Faction gasping on the ground,</L>
<L>See bloated Luxury with famish'd jaws,</L>
<L>See curs'd Corruption with her gilded claws,</L>
<L>See pois'nous Perfidy with patriot air,</L>
<L>See venal Villainy, see mad Despair,</L>
<L>A ghastly groupe! in fell confusion lie</L>
<L>Beneath thy aweful frown, O Truth, and die.</L>
</LG>

<L>The caverns yawn, the rocky bars give way,</L>
<L>See Genius burst her bands, and spring to day,</L>

Spurning the cave, accurs'd Corruption's cell,</L>
<L>Where Envy broods, where venal vapours dwell,</L>
<L>Thy bane, O Truth; see, see, she joyful soars,</L>
<L>She drinks th' etherial ray, she high explores</L>
<L>Her native heav'n, by Virtue's hand set free</L>
<L>She gains new strength, her piercing eye shall see</L>
<L>With tenfold force where Wisdom's secrets lie</L>
<L>Beneath th' abyss, above the starry sky;</L>
<L>Through Nature's works her mimic hand shall play</L>
<L>Where Freedom prompts, where Virtue points the way:</L>
<L>Ambition there to blameless heights shall rise,</L>
<L>There guiltless Glory gain th' immortal prize;</L>
<L>See Sculpture rear her life-creating hand,</L>
<L>See thinking stone on story'd basis stand;</L>
<L>There classic piles attract the wond'ring ken,</L>
<L>Here Genius dips the pencil and the pen;</L>
<L>In kindred lights with friendly ray shall shine</L>
<L>A MASON's muse, a HAYMAN's groupe divine,</L>
<L>Unrival'd lov'd; see HOGARTH's fancy reign</L>
<L>In BUTLER's rich, unborrow'd matchless vein;</L>
<L>Through blissful scenes the raptur'd mind shall rove,</L>
<L>New POPES shall sing, new LAMBERTS paint the grove:</L>

<L>Did ROUBILIAC instruct the rocks to feel?</L>

<L>Nature and Art their utmost pow'r shall shew,</L>
<L>And SHAKESPEARS yet unborn, and GARRICKS glow.</L>
<L>The Arts exult at Virtue's great command</L>
<L>With Taste, with Liberty in either hand;</L>
<L>Triumphant Britain smiles, near, near each side</L>
<L>See native Honesty, see native Pride,</L>
<L>With Grecian worth, with Roman bent to vye,</L>
<L>Fame at her heart, and Glory in her eye,</L>
<L>With ancient Rome in her MAECENAS' days,</L>
<L>When Judgment gave, when Genius wore the bays,</L>
<L>With both shall Britain now maintain the strife,</L>
<L>To lift up nature and to polish life.</L>

Be hence thy high concern, be hence thy care,</L>

<L>By both MINERVAS crown'd, O Britain, shine,</L>
<L>Let learning still, let conquest still be thine;</L>
<L>Let courage, taste, and truth thy sons adorn,</L>
<L>Let BACONS yet, let MARLBOROUGHS yet unborn,</L>

Rapt with fierce fury, thro' the glorious field,</L>
<L>Or steddiest counsels, and deliberate care.</L>

<LG>
<L>But hark! the trumpet's clangor rends the sky,</L>
<L>And the loud clarions sound the voice of war.</L>
<L>Forth issue <HI>Prussia</HI>'s troops, in various bands;</L>
<L>While these to <HI>Leipsic</HI>'s walls their rapid march</L>
<L>Direct, those to proud <HI>Dresden</HI>'s royal tow'rs.</L>

<L>Near thrice three circling years his generous Soul</L>
<L>Had cultivated peace, whose studious arts</L>

<L>From various climes beset, the perilous storm</L>
<L>Soon as he saw concentring from afar,</L>

<L>Three several hosts their several charge assign'd;</L>
<L>There to secure <HI>Silesia</HI>'s plains, and here</L>

<L>Yet still the generous Prince his ire repress'd:</L>

March his whole host, in two main columns rang'd,</L>

<L>The foe at earliest dawn. The night's long stage</L>
<L>His troops the rigour of th' inclement sky</L>
<L>With hearts unchill'd endure. He in the front,</L>
<L>Pre-eminent in danger and in toil,</L>
<L>Unmindful of repose, his list'ning bands</L>
<L>Incessant animates: with liveliest cheer,</L>
<L>And with endearing accents fires their souls.</L>
<L>"My glorious partners in the bold emprize</L>

</LG>

<L>Thus while he spake, th'invigorated troops</L>
<L>Glow with fresh fire, and feel the gen'rous flame</L>
<L>Glance thro' their thrilling veins: the loit'ring Sun</L>
<L>They chide, impatient, panting for the field.</L>

<L>In strong battalions regularly ranged;</L>
<L>Line after line, and file succeeding file;</L>
<L>Here the right wing display'd, and there the left,</L>
<L>Each on a tow'ring hill. In order due</L>
<L>Onward they march: when in broad front appear</L>

<L>"Advance (said mighty <HI>Brandenburgh</HI>) advance;</L>

Rush to the plains, and Horse to Horse oppose.</L>
<L>Swift they descend, and with impetuous force</L>
<L>Burst on the foe: when from the hostile rear</L>

<L>Hurl'd from their brazen throats, the flaming balls</L>
<L>Innumerable: at the dire din alarm'd</L>
<L>And storms of thund'ring metal, back they bend</L>
<L>Their not imprudent steps: then form'd afresh,</L>
<L>To the brisk charge return. Now nor the roar</L>
<L>Of bellowing cannon, nor incessant fire,</L>
<L>Nor wide-extended dyke, nor obvious mound</L>

<L>Hov'ring around thee, Victory attend</L>
<L>They every march! — Beneath the hallow'd shade</L>
<L>Rest thee awhile: thy noble toil suspend:</L>
<L>Deign o'er thy brows to bind this laurel wreath,</L>
<L><PB N="18" REF="15"/>
Th'ambitious Muse with pleasing labour wove.</L>
<L>How did thine heart exult, when thou surveyd'st</L>
<L>Thy daring legions, by thy conduct fir'd,</L>
<L>And all thy emulous Chiefs: above those Chiefs</L>
<L>High-blazing, as the peerless Star, that leads</L>
<L>Th'ethereal host o'er the wide azure pour'd,</L>
<L>Resplendent train! Next thee, great BEVERN shone</L>
<L>Sublime, and darted terror on the foe,</L>
<L>Reflecting his illustrious Monarch's rays.</L>
<L>Nor, valiant MULLER, shall thy prowess pass</L>
<L>Unsung; who with resistless might dispers'd</L>
<L>Th'embattel'd ranks, like clouds of sleeting sand</L>
<L>Driv'n by th'impetuous whirlwind's rapid wing.</L>
<L>With these, the tribute of th'applauding bard</L>
<L>Unnumber'd heroes claim, whose various deeds</L>
<L>Were long to trace. The gen'rous FREDERICK's love</L>
<L>Shall crown their merits, and their glorious names</L>
<L>Live in the records of immortal fame.</L>

<L>Thence to the <HI>Saxon</HI> bands, in <HI>Pirna</HI>'s fort</L>
<L>Immur'd, he wings his way, bent to subdue</L>
<L>That treach'rous foe. Nor long, e'er from the camp</L>
<L>Th'imprison'd squadrons start, o'er <HI>Egra</HI>'s streams</L>
<L>From the bridg'd path, while sable Night resum'd</L>
<L>Her reign alternate, and th'incumbent mists</L>
<L>Spred o'er heaven's face impenetrable gloom,</L>
<L>Deep'ning the wonted shades. How vain th'attempt!</L>
<L>Their wiles how frustrate! The vast summit's height,</L>
<L>Fronting thy turrets, <HI>Koningstein,</HI> with march</L>
<L>Laborious as they climb, th'uprising sun</L>
<L>Shew'd them to PRUSSIA's view; whose strong defiles</L>
<L>Enclos'd them round. What gleam of hope remains?</L>
<L>Where shall they fly? how force th'obstructed way?</L>
<L>Aghast, and thunder-struck, th'obdurate King</L>
<L>His high-swoln pride submits, in suppliant terms</L>
<L>Sues for that peace he insolently scorn'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus quell'd proud <HI>Austria,</HI> and th'ambitious <HI>Pole</HI></L>
<L>Flung from his tow'ring hopes, the wint'ry storms,</L>

Rushing impetuous, with malignant blasts</L>

<L>Soon as the balmy Zephyrs' earliest gales</L>
<L>Led on the genial spring, great FREDERICK's breast</L>
<L>Fraught with deep counsels in still silence form'd,</L>
<L>Sudden unfolds. His ev'ry valiant band</L>
<L>Instant he summons: at his great command</L>
<L>Their tacit march they speed; and swift attain</L>
<L><HI>Bohemia</HI>'s realm, three formidable hosts.</L>
<L>This the fam'd BEVERN, that brave SCHWERIN led;</L>
<L>The third their Monarch's fav'rite conduct boasts.</L>
<L>War soon resumes his flaming torch. — Again</L>
<L>Imperial <HI>Austria</HI>'s congregated pow'rs.</L>
<L>Appear, in numerous squadrons firmly rang'd,</L>
<L>A mighty host: and KONINGSEGG commands.</L>
<L>Deep was their rear entrench'd; by village walls</L>
<L>Their right was shelter'd, by impervious woods</L>
<L>Encompass'd the left wing. Yet not the less</L>
<L>BEVERN impetuous drove his rapid bands,</L>
<L>By every valiant Chieftain well sustained;</L>
<L>Storm'd the strong cover, thro' th' intrenchments rush'd,</L>
<L>And pierc'd their dense array. In sudden rout</L>
<L>All their vast cavalry involv'd the Foe</L>
<L>Astonish'd views: while gallant LESWITZ springs</L>
<L>Fierce and undaunted 'mid the hostile fire,</L>
<L>Swift flies thro' many a perilous defile,</L>
<L>And with dread chase pursues the timorous host,</L>
<L>(Havoc and ruin marching in their rear)</L>
<L>From hill to hill in wild confusion driv'n.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To join thee, BEVERN, bends his eager course</L>
<L>Intrepid SCHWERIN, to thy soul endear'd</L>
<L>By kindred Virtue's ever sacred tie.</L>
<L>Him to ensnare, within cover'd dale</L>
<L>Lurks the secreted foe, a numerous band!</L>
<L>Soon their insidious wiles the wary chief</L>
<L><PB N="20" REF="17"/>
Espied; encounter'd, and discomfited.</L>
<L>Thence his impetuous progress onward rolls</L>
<L>Wide o'er the land, unbounded, uncontroll'd,</L>
<L>With torrent force. Before his fiery sword</L>
<L>On every hand they scour, nor dare confront</L>
<L>His mighty rage: inactive, down they throw</L>
<L>Their unavailing arms. The regions round</L>
<L>Bend to the victor, and confess his sway.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now mighty FRED'RICK with observant ken</L>
<L>Saw, where the foe their various squadrons drew</L>
<L>From the tow'rd fortress, and each banner'd host;</L>
<L>Rang'd in proud pomp beneath their mightiest Chief,</L>
<L>Who from the terror of dread PRUSSIA's arm</L>
<L>So late retreated, with sad overthrow</L>
<L>Gall'd on <HI>Welmina</HI>'s memorable plains:</L>
<L>Yet dares again, by conscious valour fir'd.</L>
<L>Again his thundring arm dread PRUSSIA rears.</L>
<L>Impatient of delay, with instant march</L>
<L>O'er <HI>Moldaw</HI>'s streams he pass'd: when lo! in camp.</L>
<L>High-fenc'd, by nature's favour and by art</L>
<L>Strong-cover'd, deep-entrench'd, proudly deem'd</L>
<L>Impregnable, th' imperial Army lay,</L>
<L>Much glorying in their strength, in numbers far</L>
<L>Superior. Still undaunted his bold march</L>
<L>FRED'RICK pursues: He nor their 'vantag'd ground,</L>
<L>Nor high-fenc'd camp, nor trenches deep regards,</L>
<L>Nor numbers far superior. On he leads</L>
<L>To the fierce combat his courageous bands.</L>
<L>They, by their Monarch's voice, (that fav'rite voice,)</L>
<L>Enliven'd, joyous spring, with sweet presage</L>
<L>Of victory; their standards wide unfurl'd</L>
<L>In awful pomp, with rich emblazonry</L>
<L>Of vivid colours, streaming to the wind:</L>
<L>And o'er the horrent plain of glitt'ring steel</L>
<L>A wavy Harvest formidably gleam'd,</L>
<L>Innumerable faulchions, the sun's blaze</L>

<L>Nigh to the foe advanc'd, each Warrior brave,</L>
<L>Commanders, and Commanded, with like zeal</L>
<L>Inflam'd, and emulation high, contend,</L>
<L>Who first shall the untrodden path explore,</L>
<L>Who tempt the marish, who the threat'ning mound</L>

<L>The onset dire, enkindled at th' alarm</L>
<L>Of drums loud-thundring, and the trumpet's clang</L>
<L>Sonorous. Fierce the conflict rag'd 'twixt host</L>
<L>And host: The field throughout, was seen no glimpse</L>
<L>Of dastard fear: each nobly signaliz'd</L>
<L>Their valorous ardor. Front to front they met,</L>
<L>Warrior with warrior clos'd, and steed with steed</L>
<L>In stern encounter. The hoarse cannon's voice</L>
<L>Echoes with bellowing roar: redundant smoke</L>
<L>Pours o'er the envelop'd sky, with horrid flash</L>
<L>Pierc'd frequent, and quick glance of sulph'rous flames.</L>
<L>Swift thro' the ranks undaunted FRED'RICK sprung,</L>

<L>Now in the Van, now Rear: on ev'ry part,</L>

<L>With splendid conduct, animating sounds,</L>
<L>And brave example, his obsequious bands</L>

<L>How shall the Muse the wondrous havoc paint,</L>

Clove with keen edge the tortur'd foe in twain.</L>

<L>Here from the quiv'ring trunk the sever'd head</L>
<L>Swift flies: here the lop'd limb their lord desert,</L>

In all thy height of lustre, matchless Prince,</L>

<L>Undaunted FREDERICK with his furious host,</L>
<L>Thro' thund'ring batteries and thro' fierce defiles,</L>
<L>Up the steep cliff his arduous road maintain'd.</L>
<L>Thrice he assay'd the <HI>Austrian</HI>'s pow'rful wing</L>

<L>Then calm receding with serene retreat</L>

<L>Soon <HI>Russia</HI>'s legions (from her populous clime</L>

<L>Accelerate, and FREDERICK'S realms invade.</L>
<L>Thus tho' insulted, the considerate Chief</L>

<L>His generous terms disdain'd, his pow'r defy'd,</L>
<L>His territories spoil'd, war he declares</L>
<L>Immediate; trusting in his righteous Cause,</L>
<L>And Heav'n's protecting Arm. LEWHALD led on</L>
<L>The squdrons, and encounter'd more than twice</L>
<L>His force, entrench'd on tow'ring hill secure.</L>
<L>Nathless he vigorous charg'd; their foremost lines</L>

<L>Wide-wasting. Yet, lest the superior Foe</L>
<L>Crush his brave host, by the unfriendly site</L>
<L>Disfavour'd, by enormous multitudes</L>
<L>Oppress'd, to <HI>Velau</HI>'s camp the Chief mature</L>

<L>Vaunting united terrors, onward move</L>
<L>Under their gallant Leaders, great SOUBISE</L>
<L>And HILDBURGHAUSEN. Their proud threats t'oppose</L>
<L>FREDERICK delay'd not: his assembled troops</L>
<L>He rang'd in just array, and thus address'd:</L>
<L>"My Friends, my Warriors brave!—The Foe's advanc'd;</L>

Think how we've fought! what glorious laurels won!</L>
<L>Think on the equitable plea, that drew</L>
<L>These valiant swords, and vindicate the cause:</L>

<L>He ended; on he led his valiant files</L>
<L>Dauntless, and bid them storm the the adverse wing:</L>
<L>But on the edge of onset (his quick eye</L>
<L>Determining) instant as lightning's glance,</L>

<L>Soon disarray'd, and with pursuit severe</L>
<L>Drove, as the Lion drives his trembling chace.</L>
<L>Then from each host the Cannon's bellowing voice</L>

<L>Their ignominious flight, with soul defeat</L>
<L>Confounded, and in ruin dire involv'd.</L>
