<HEAD><HI>CHAP. I.</HI> Of its Build∣ing, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THIS royal fortress stands east of the city
<PB N="26" REF="24"/>of London, near the bank of the Thames, where it may defend or command both.</P>
<P>The principal building, and from which it has its name, is the great white square Tower in the mid∣dle. 'Tis a regular, strong, lofty structure, and the old∣est within the walls, being built by William the Con∣queror, in the year 1078.</P>
<P>There are besides several
<PB N="27" REF="25"/>other considerable build∣ings, that have been added to this grand fortress, at di∣vers times since, of which I shall speak hereafter: the whole is encompassed with a strong wall, and that sur∣rounded with a broad deep ditch, supplied with water out of the Thames.</P>
<P>The entrances into the Tower are over two brid∣ges, one at the west end for carts, coaches, foot-passengers,
<PB N="28" REF="26"/><HI>&amp;c.</HI> the other over a draw-bridge from the wharf on the south side, facing the Thames, for: foot-passengers only. It has besides a passage from the river, call'd Trai∣tor's-bridge; because for∣merly, all persons com∣mitted to the Tower for treason were brought thro' it in boats.</P>
<P>The government of this important place, being of
<PB N="29" REF="27"/>high honour, as well as of great trust, is generally committed to a peer of the realm, who is ftiled <HI>Con∣stable of the Tower:</HI> He has a deputy governor, and many other officers under him.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="30" REF="28"/>
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. II.</HI> Of the Lions, and other wild beasts in the Tower.</HEAD>
<P>WHen you have passed the two soldiers, cal∣led <HI>the spur-guard,</HI> who stand without the first gate, you will see the figure of a Lion, against the keep∣er's house, right before you; and another over the door on your right hand, where you are to enter to
<PB N="31" REF="29"/>see the curiosities — <HI>Here each person pays</HI> Three∣pence <HI>for admittance.</HI></P>
<P>The wild creatures that are there shewn, are all kept in strong dens, so that you need not be under any fear of danger from them; — Don't venture too near, and you may view them very safely.</P>
<P>The dens are made in the form the pictures re∣present; in which are
<PB N="32" REF="30"/>two rooms; the lower has strong thick bars of wood, the upper, iron: in one of which the keeper secures the creature, whilst the other is clean'd, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And there are some spare dens, in which are no wild beasts at present.</P>
<P>You first see a fine <HI>Maiden Lioness,</HI> which was a pre∣sent from the consul of Algiers; she is about four∣teen years old: Her name is <HI>Jenny.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="31"/>Second, another <HI>Lioness,</HI> from Africa, whose name is <HI>Phillis.</HI></P>
<P>Third, a he <HI>Lion,</HI> nam'd <HI>Marco,</HI> consort to Phillis. He has majesty in his coun∣tenance that strikes an awe in the beholders; a grace∣ful mane, of thick, long, shagg'd hair, ornaments his strong neck and shoulders: He has a huge head, and a prodigious wide mouth, with frightful teeth; this
<PB N="34" REF="32"/>
<FIGURE>
<HEAD>LION.</HEAD>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="35" REF="33"/>eyes are red, fiery, and sunk deep into his head; his nose is very large, with wide nostrils: both his sight and smelling are very sharp; his big-sinew'd legs and thighs are strong, like bars of iron; and his claws, like hooks; five of which he has upon each foot be∣fore, and four on those be∣hind, sheath'd like a cat's; with which lie strikes, and catches his prey like that animal.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="34"/>His roaring voice is so terrible, that it not only strikes mankind with fear, but all creatures with such surprize, that they dare not stir: he may therefore, with these properties, he justly stil'd the <HI>king of beasts.</HI></P>
<P>Marco and Phillis are both from the same coun∣try as Jenny; and were likewise a present from the consul of Algiers; each of them is about nine years old.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="35"/>This royal pair have bred several times in the Tower; they have a young <HI>prince</HI> of two years old, nam'd <HI>Nero,</HI> now to be seen there; besides three young ones, which were brought forth on the 19th day of June, 1740; whom we shall pay our court to be∣fore we go.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="36"/><FIGURE>
<HEAD>LIONESS.</HEAD>
</FIGURE></P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="37"/>The <HI>Lioness</HI> is lesser than the Lion, and has no mane, her body being smoother and sleeker: the colour of them both are the same; which is a dun, inclining to a pale yellow, with a darkish cast on the surface.</P>
<P>The fourth animal is a he <HI>Leopard</HI> from the East-Indies, about seven years old: This is a very beau∣tiful
<PB N="40" REF="38"/>
<FIGURE>
<HEAD>LEOPARD.</HEAD>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="41" REF="39"/>creature, of a yellow colour, finely mark'd with black spots. It is much smaller than any of the Lions or Tigers that are here, nor does it seem so fierce; his name is <HI>Will.</HI>— Now you pass to another yard, where you see.</P>
<P>The fifth, which is a she <HI>Panther,</HI> call'd <HI>Jenny;</HI> the hair of this creature is short and mossy, and of a bright yellow, beautifully mark'd
<PB N="42" REF="40"/>with round black spots, like the Leopard's, but not quite so full. 'Tis in size, shape, and colour, so much like the Leopard, that when asunder their difference is not easily distinguish'd; and when together, only by nicely observing their spots: Therefore we need not give its figure.</P>
<P>The person who shews these creatures, tells us, that the Panther is pro∣duced
<PB N="43" REF="41"/>from the coupling of the Lion and Leopard; others say, 'tis the he Pan∣ther and Lioness which be∣get the Leopard: but the most probable opinion is, that the Leopard is the male, and the Panther the female, of one and the same species.</P>
<P>The Panther is said to be of a fierce nature than the Leopard, more greedy of blood, very swift, and
<PB N="44" REF="42"/>catches her prey by leap∣ing upon it suddenly.</P>
<P>Sixth and seventh are a he and she <HI>Tiger</HI> from the South Sea; they are kept together in one den, and have had several litters of whelps. They have been in the Tower about ten years; their names are <HI>Will</HI> and <HI>Phillis;</HI> and they have a son, whose name is <HI>Dick,</HI> who was bred in the Tower, and is now about
<PB N="45" REF="43"/>six years old. He had a brother whelp'd with him, who liv'd but a little while. Dick is a beautiful mark'd creature, and finely shap∣ed; but stoops a little in his shoulders; occasion'd by the fall of a table upon his back, when he was at nurse.</P>
<P>The two old ones, Will and Phillis, are mark'd with round spots, like the Leopard; whereas those
<PB N="46" REF="44"/>
<FIGURE>
<HEAD>TWO TIGERS.</HEAD>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="47" REF="45"/>found in the East-Indies are streak'd all down their sides, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> instead of spots.</P>
<P>The Tiger is shap'd ve∣ry much like the Lioness, only somewhat lesser, and has a shorter neck; but is bigger than either Leopard or Panther. Its colour and spots resemble the Leo∣pard's; but they have not near so many, nor are they so bright and beautiful.</P>
<P>The Tiger is of a very
<PB N="48" REF="46"/>wild and fierce nature, exceeding ravenous, and of a prodigious swiftness: He spares neither man nor beast; but if he can satisfy his hunger with the flesh of beasts, he will not attack mankind. It is said, that this creature is seldom ta∣ken but in defence of its young. These two in the Tower sport and play ve∣ry wantonly together. The female is now big with young.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="47"/>The eighth animal is a <HI>Racoon,</HI> chain'd in the yard, where it has a wooden hutch or box, like a Fox's, to run into when it is minded. It is about the size of the Fox, has a thick fur on his back, sides, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of a dark, grizly colour, with a thick bushy tail. It feeds on flesh, fish, or roots, like the Fox; and seems to partake much of
<PB N="50" REF="48"/>
<FIGURE>
<HEAD>RACOON.</HEAD>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="51" REF="49"/>the nature of that crafty creature.</P>
<P>The next are two <HI>Vul∣tures,</HI> in separate woonden cages; the first has been in the Tower twenty years, the second about six. They are both of a colour, which is like that of the Dove; and their size is equal like∣wise, which is bigger than the Eagle. Their beaks are large, and crooked at the end; their necks, for
<PB N="52" REF="50"/>
<FIGURE>
<HEAD>VULTURE.</HEAD>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="53" REF="51"/>the most part bare of fea∣thers. The craw of the Vulture hangs down like a bag before the stomach, or breast; under the throat it has a space of about an hand breadth, cloathed rather with hairs, like to those of a calf, than fea∣thers; and the inside of the wings are cover'd with a soft fleece of down, which is peculiar to the Vulture alone, among birds of prey.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="52"/>It is said, that Vultures have an excellent sense of smelling, above all other birds; so that they can perceive the savour of dead carcasses from a-far: And that from their devouring of dead bodies, they were call'd <HI>living tombs.</HI> They are said to follow armies; because in their marches a great many men, horses, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> fall here and there by the way. Job has the
<PB N="55" REF="53"/>like description of the Eagle; — <HI>and where the slain are, there is she,</HI> chap. xxxix. 30.</P>
<P>The antients have deli∣vered, that the Vulture is content only with dead carcasses, abstaining from the ravin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and slaughter of living animals: but some moderns affirm, that it preys upon living birds, fawns hares, kids, lambs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="54"/><FIGURE>
<HEAD>EAGLE.</HEAD>

<P><PB N="57" REF="55"/>The last are <HI>two Eagles</HI> in separate cages; they have been in the Tower about thirty years. They are of a dark brown co∣lour, almost black, unless on the top of their heads, pinnions of their wings, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which are of a bright reddish brown; and are therefore called <HI>the brown Eagles.</HI></P>
<P><HI>For another</HI> Three-pence <HI>you see the following.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="56"/>First, young <HI>prince Nero,</HI> of two years old, whom we just mentioned; son of Marco and Phillis, bred in the Tower: he has a fine shock'd mane, and is really a beautiful creature, and exceedingly well educat∣ed; for upon my expres∣sing a desire of visiting his lodging, at a word speaking, he march'd down with great condescension from his upper into his
<PB N="59" REF="57"/>lower apartment, and gave me the opportunity of en∣tering his den; where, having satisfied my curio∣sity in viewing his dining room, kitchen, and bed∣chamber; his manner of living; particular ceremo∣ny in eating, drinking, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> at my departure from thence he would fain have took me by the hand: But our acquaintance being but slender, I declin'd ac∣cepting
<PB N="60" REF="58"/>so great a mark of his friendship, till I knew him better.</P>
<P>Upon the keeper's put∣ting into his den a piece of lights, he seemingly took very little notice of it, but couch'd down on his bel∣ly, with his fore-feet out, like a cat that is going to leap at a mouse; and in an instant gave a sudden spring, from the farthest side of the den, and seiz'd
<PB N="61" REF="59"/>it with amazing fierce∣ness.</P>
<P>My young readers will excuse my not giving them the picture of prince Nero, because he is so like his papa, whose royal visage you may see in page 34, that it would appear almost the same.</P>
<P>Second, a <HI>Lioness,</HI> thir∣teen years old, bred like∣wise in the Tower, from a former pair that are now
<PB N="62" REF="60"/>dead: This is the fiercest beast in the Tower; her name is <HI>Nanny.</HI></P>
<P>Third, the young he <HI>Tiger,</HI> nam'd <HI>Dick,</HI> son of Will and Phillis; de∣scribed in pag. 44, 45.</P>
<P>Fourth, a <HI>Porcupine</HI> in an iron cage. This is one of the strangest animals in the world; its back, sides and tail, are guarded with strong quills, each a foot and half long, all pointed

<PB N="64" REF="62"/>as sharp as needles, and spotted with black and white: these the creature draws up all together, that they look like so many half-pikes; and stand so distinct, that the skin of the beast may be seen be∣tween each; and then sud∣denly strikes them all back with great force, as if they went with a strong spring; turning her self about at the same time, every way,

<PB N="67" REF="63"/>Snake; to all which tribe 'tis an utter enemy.</P>
<P>Whatever its antipathy may be to the snake kind, to man it seems a very in∣considerable enemy: it is neither very swift, nor fierce; and though it is so well armed, 'tis rather for its own defence, than of∣fence to any other animal.</P>
<P>Its flesh, in those coun∣tries where 'tis found, is esteem'd by the natives as
<PB N="68" REF="64"/>good foot. This in the Tower is fed with bread, roots, and fruit: It was brought from the East-Indies.</P>
<P>Fifth, in the same room is a large old <HI>Ape,</HI> which at command does several diverting trickes.</P>
<P>Sixth, an uncommon, large, beautiful <HI>Bird,</HI> call∣ed <HI>Warwoven,</HI> or <HI>King</HI> of the <HI>Vawous.</HI> It was brought to the Tower in Septem∣ber

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IV.</HI> Histories and Observations on the Lions in the Tower, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>LIons, Tigers, Panthers, and Leopards, are fed
<PB N="75" REF="71"/>with sheeps heads and plucks twice a day; of which a Lion eats four or five in a day: but Leo∣pards, Panthers, and Ti∣gers, are much fonder of raw dogs-flesh. They are always separated when they eat, or they would quarrel. The wild Lions of Africa are said to prey chiefly upon wild Boars: which sometimes prove so hard to conquer, that both
<PB N="76" REF="72"/>have been found dead to∣gether in their gore. They drink as often as they drink as often as they please, usually several times in a day; each having a stone trought in his den.</P>
<P>The Lion being an ani∣mal of a hot and thirsty nature, was by the antients represented as an emblem, or symbol of sultry wea∣ther.</P>
<P>The Tower has been a place for keeping of wild
<PB N="77" REF="73"/>beasts in above five hun∣dred years.</P>
<P>On Sunday the 5th of August, 1604. a Lioness, named <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> brought forth a young Lion in the Tower, which young one died the next day. This was the first Lion whelp'd in that place, and probably in England.</P>
<P>The 26th of February following, the same Lion∣ess brought forth another
<PB N="78" REF="74"/>young Lion; which by command of King James, was taken from the dam as soon as whelp'd, and nurs∣ed by hand: but this also died in about sixteen days.</P>
<P>The greatest age any Lions have been known to live in the Tower, is about twenty years.</P>
<P>The Lion, in the day times, seems to be a very sluggish, heavy animal, that hates to be rous'd, and is
<PB N="79" REF="75"/>no sooner up, but, if suf∣fer'd, will immediately slap down again: Perhaps, in the night they may be otherwise; it being more natural to them to seek their prey in. The holy Psalmist hath the like ob∣servation: <HI>Thou makest darnkness, and it is night: wherein all the beasts of the forest do creep forth. The young Lions roar after their prey, and seek their
<PB N="80" REF="76"/>meat from God. The su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ariseth, they gather them selves together; and lay them down in their dens<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> Psal. civ.</P>
<P>The Lioness goes with young exactly four months: None were ever known to have more than three at a litter. They are whelp'd with their eyes open, and are taken from the dam immediately, or they would perish.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="77"/>They are very tender, and require a great deal of care in nursing; it being exceedingly difficult to bring up a young Lion (and so it is Tigers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>) They often die in breeding their teeth, sometimes in strong convulsions. The same is observ'd by the people of Barbary, to hap∣pen to the young wild Lions of that country, or they would be much more
<PB N="82" REF="78"/>numerous than they are in those parts.</P>
<P>Young Lions are kept about twelve months in a warm room, before they are put into dens; but be∣fore they come to that age are chain'd, and are always separated when they eat their victuals. Their savage nature comes on gradually as they grow up, and they are three years a coming to their full growth.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="79"/>It has been the common opinion, that the Lion is afraid of fire: their keep∣ers deny that they are so. One of them, who now attends the wild beasts in the Tower, going one night in the last hard win∣ter to the den of the old Lion, with a lighted can∣dle, held his hand near the bars, to see if the crea∣ture was come down in∣to the lower apartment;
<PB N="84" REF="80"/>when suddenly he put out his paw, and wounded the man so dangerously in the back of his hand, that he very narrowly escap'd losing it: And this he brings as an instance to shew that they are not afraid of fire.</P>
<P>The Lion often sleeps and snores with his eyes open, and likewise with them shut.</P>
<P>King James the first, be∣ing
<PB N="85" REF="81"/>minded to make trial of the nature and courage of the Lion, and some o∣ther wild beasts, went to the Tower, attended by several of the nobility; where he ordered a Lion and Lioness to be turned out of their dens, and a Cock to be cast to them; which they presently kil∣led, and suck'd its blood.</P>
<P>Next a Lamb was or∣dered to be put to them,
<PB N="86" REF="82"/>which the Lions, out of their generosity, never of∣fer'd to touch, although it went close up to them.</P>
<P>Then two Mastiffs were let loose upon a single Li∣on, which they presently seized, and turn'd upon his back: and tho' the Lion was superior to them in strength, yet they were his match in courage.</P>
<P>Some time after, a Lion was turned out of his den
<PB N="87" REF="83"/>to a Bear, which had kill'd a child; but the Lion would not attack the Bear.</P>
<P>They try'd several other single Lions, and at length two together; but all fled from him, and wanted ra∣ther to get into their dens.</P>
<P>A Stone-horse was put into the yard with the first Lion and the Bear; the Horse, after a little while, fell to grazing between them, which they never
<PB N="88" REF="84"/>offer'd to touch. After∣wards six Dogs were let in, who flew upon the Horse, most in sight at their first entrance; and would soon have worried him to death, had not three stout fellows enter'd in, who rescu'd the Horse, and brought away the Dogs; while the Lion and Bear stood staring up∣on them. At this sight were present King James
<PB N="89" REF="85"/>the first, the Queen, Prince, and divers of the nobility.</P>
<P>And though the Bear which kill'd the child escap'd at this time; he was afterwards, by com∣mand of the King, baited to death with Dogs, upon a stage.</P>
<P>There was a Spaniel Dog, for some offence, cast into the Lion's den; but the Lion did not attempt to hurt him: and this
<PB N="90" REF="86"/>Dog continued in the den with the Lion several years, and there died.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I. INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>FRom the Lions Tow∣er you pass on over the bridge right before
<PB N="92" REF="88"/>you, when presently you will come to the Warders, who are upon duty at their ward, or gate.</P>
<P>They are easily known by their peculiar dress: Upon their heads they wear slta crown'd caps of black velvet, with a band of ribbons of divers co∣lours. Their coats are scarlet, laced with gold round their skirts, sleeves, and up their sides; and
<PB N="93" REF="89"/>round their wastes a broad laced belt, with the king's badge of silver, gilt with gold, upon their breasts and backs, representing the Thistle, Rose, and Crown, and G. R. in capitals.</P>
<P>There are forty Ward∣ers belonging to the Tow∣er, ten of whom are upon duty at a time. These gentlemen have authority to examine all persons
<PB N="94" REF="90"/>coming into the Tower; and one of them will at∣tend such as are going to see the Curiosities, to shew and explain them; without whose assistance, it would be difficult to find them out, or to un∣derstand them rightly. For this service, when you dismiss the Warder, it is customary to give him a gratuity, according to your own generosity.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. II.</HI> Of the invincible <HI>Spanish Armada</HI> of Philip <HI>II.</HI> King of Spain.</HEAD>
<P>IT may not be improper to inform my young readers, that in the year 1588, Philip II. King of Spain, having prepared a powerful navy, which consisted of One hundred and thirty ships, with
<PB N="99" REF="95"/>which he design'd to in∣vade and conquer Eng∣land; thought himself so sure of victory, that his fleet was christen'd by the Pope, <HI>The Invincible Ar∣mada;</HI> which signifies, a strength that could not be overcome.</P>
<P>The great Queen Eli∣zabeth hearing of this vast armament, instead of be∣ing dismay'd, like a valiant Princess, order'd a strong
<PB N="100" REF="96"/>fleet to be fitted out with all possible expedition, and gave the command of it to Sir Francis Drake, and other great and valiant commanders: And not∣withstanding the enemy was greatly superior in number and strength of ships, the English engag'd the Spanish fleet upon our own coasts, and after nine or ten days fight, gain'd a most glorious victory, tak∣ing,
<PB N="101" REF="97"/>

</FIGURE>
<PB N="102" REF="98"/>burning and sinking eighty of their ships; in which were killed thir∣teen thousand five hun∣dred of their men, and above two thousand were taken prisoners.</P>
<P>At this ever memorable victory were taken various instruments of war, with which the Spaniards in∣tended to have tortured the poor English, had they been so unfortunate as to
<PB N="103" REF="99"/>have been overcome by that haughty and cruel nation.</P>
<P>And they are here trea∣sured up as a noble trophy of old English valour; and are a constant lesson, from generation to generation, to Britain's sons, of what their forefathers did to de∣fend their country against Spanish bondage, and stir them up to emulation.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. III.</HI> Of the Arms, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> taken from the Spaniards in Queen Elizabeth's time, <HI>1588;</HI> and other curio∣sities.</HEAD>
<P>YOU are first shewn a number of <HI>pikes,</HI> each six yards long, with velvet holdings about their mid∣dle; the steel points were gilt with gold, upon some
<PB N="105" REF="101"/>of which the gilding is still visible. The Spanish Dons were so sure of conquest, that they spared no cost in equipping themselves; because they intended the English should pay for all.</P>
<P>Over head hangs a large number of Spanish <HI>pistols</HI> and <HI>targets,</HI> which were the only fire-arems they had then in use; and which were discharg'd with a match: One of these lies
<PB N="106" REF="102"/>in a window below, for the curious to examine.</P>
<P>Next you see a parcel of Spanish <HI>launces,</HI> of a prodi∣gious size, with which those polite people design∣ed, after they had conquer∣ed the English, to have bled them with, to prevent their falling into fevers. Queen Elizabeth, being always tender of her sub∣jects, thought those instru∣ments would make too
<PB N="107" REF="103"/>large an orifice, therefore order'd them to be dis∣arm'd of such dangerous tools; which was quickly perform'd by her gallant captains.</P>
<P>Near to the last, are a great many frightful wea∣pons, resembling bill∣hooks, but a great deal larger.</P>
<P>Next, a parcel of Spa∣nish <HI>pole-axes,</HI> with three or four tangs at one end;
<PB N="108" REF="104"/>at the other a sharp point.</P>
<P>Then you are shewn a small train of <HI>Artillery,</HI> consisting of about ten pretty little <HI>cannon</HI> in car∣riages; all ranged inn beau∣tiful order: They were a present from the city of London to King Charles the first, when he was a child, for him to learn the art of war by.</P>
<P>Two of the <HI>Danes clubs,</HI> each six foot long; despe∣rate
<PB N="109" REF="105"/>rate weapons. These, we are told, are of great anti∣quity, and that they have been in the Tower ever since it was built. The people whose custody they are now in, call them the <HI>womens weapons;</HI> because, they say, in those times, above eight hundred years ago, the women conspired against the Danes, and de∣stroy'd thirty thousand, by cutting their throats, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
<PB N="110" REF="106"/>for which reason, they tell you, the women have ever since had the wall of the man, the upper end of the table, and the first cut.</P>
<P>Next, a cruel instrument called a <HI>Spanish cravat;</HI> with which those people design'd to torture the En∣glish. In this their necks, hands and feet were to be confin'd, in such a barba∣rous manner, that the poor sufferers must have under∣gone
<PB N="111" REF="107"/>the most exquisite tortures; till either they were starv'd to death, or expir'd thro' pain of their great torment.</P>
<P>Near to the last stands a <HI>shield,</HI> made of the skin of a Rhinoceros; which was a present from the great Mogul to King Henry the seventh.</P>
<P>Three antient Spanish <HI>spados,</HI> or <HI>swords,</HI> of dif∣ferent sizes.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="108"/>Some of the first chain∣shot, said to be invented by Admiral Drake, for tearing of rigging, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Here is likewise shewn an ill shap'd, old <HI>axe;</HI> the same with which Anne of Bullen was beheaded, by order of King Henry the eighth: She was mother to Queen Elizabeth. And with the same axe the Earl of Essex was beheaded in Queen Elizabeth's time.</P>
