<HEAD>TO THE PRINCE OF WALES.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN I consider the insignificancy of this trifle, I am surprised at my own teme∣rity: my reason would have recoiled, and left nothing but my presumption to attend it to your Royal feet, had not your graci∣ous condescension, in permitting it to ap∣proach You, encouraged me in the laudable attempt to celebrate (though by humble means) an aera, auspicious, great, and glori∣ous. The Guardian Genius of Britain having placed a Brunswick on the Throne,
<PB N="ii" REF="3"/>
saw, and self-approving, smiled upon her work; and Victory, when determined to bestow her richest wreaths of laurel upon British valour, to perpetuate her bounty, wisely chose that point of time which she foresaw must be the darling theme of fu∣ture ages, the period that gave birth to the PRINCE of WALES. Then it was that she crowned Monckton and Rodney with success; and, by the capture of <HI>Marti∣nico,</HI> secured the conquest of Grenada, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, and a supreme power over the trade and navigation of the seas, and that immeasurable chain of islands which extend from the Eastern point of Hispaniola, almost to the Continent of South America, With this view did she command Albemarle, the Pupil of her fa∣vourite Cumberland, and Pocock, who had before triumphed in the East, now to ex∣tend our conquests over the Western world. The Havannah, from its situation, a place of the first importance to our enemies, the grand rendezvous of the galleons, thought
<PB N="iii" REF="4"/>
impregnable from nature, yet fortified by every possible contrivance of military art, most unpromising to a foe, from the dan∣ger of its access, and defended by a Roman spirit, in the person of Velasco, at this great crisis, from the intrepidity, perseverance, and unanimity of our land and sea forces, yielded to the British flag.</P>
<P>Amongst the brilliant transactions of a year which makes a golden page in the En∣glish annals, we see Granby Victorious on the banks of the Weser; and our gracious Monarch, on the auspicious morning, when his beloved and amiable Consort gives an Heir to Britain, beholds the treasures of Spain pass before his Palace walls. So many illustrious, circumstances attending your Royal Highness's dawn of life, pro∣mised a zenith of glory; and the shining qualities of your youth justify our hopes, and give an ample satisfaction to our ex∣pectations. As You were the early blessing, so will You prove the latter comfort of your
<PB N="iv" REF="5"/>
Royal Parents, the Patron of Science, the Promoter of Virtue, the delight and joy of a happy, loyal people, whose affection, re∣spect, and admiration, may You ever possess, as you do those of your Royal Highness's</P>

<L>WHEN fate on some tremendous <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> seems bent,</L>

<STAGE>An Apartment in Don Leopold's Castle.</STAGE>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> Prince <HI>and</HI> Frederick.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Prince.</SPEAKER>
<P>SO! at last we are arriv'd in Don Leo∣pold's castle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thank Heaven! for since we turn'd our horses heads from the palace of Saragosa, my Prince has not till this moment honour'd his faithful Frederick with a single word.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Prince.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did imagine, my dear Frederick, that you wish'd to see me in love.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>Without doubt—the darling of your Royal patents, the idol of the people; the blooming hope of every friend to his country, and the impending terror of her soes, adorn'd with every grace of nature, shining in each ac∣complishment with all the glowing spirit of a hero, ready to burst into action, I saw my Prince, my master, in the midst of a brilliant court, surrounded with pleasures, but a stranger to happiness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="2" REF="9"/>
<SPEAKER>Prince.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis true, Frederick: I was amus'd, but never pleas'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>I saw it. I dar'd, impell'd by duty, to pry into my Prince's thoughts, and from the state of your heart, this languor, this apathy, this restless, joyless inquietude, I plainly saw that in the midst of splendor, <HI>Love</HI> was wanting to make you happy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Prince.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, Frederick; but if this love, which you imagine so essential to my happiness, should plunge me into unutterable woe, and render me for ever miserable!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>Love make a Prince miserable! Im∣possible.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Prince.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why not a Prince as well as another man?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>Heir to the Crown of Arragon, who has only to ask and obtain, to wish and be hap∣py!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Prince.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, Fred'rick; but I wou'd have the fair one love me, not as the Heir of Arra∣gon: I would owe nothing to the dignity of my station.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Sir, Fortune has arrang'd each circumstance of your adventure here to the full extent of your wishes. Chance throws into your hands a Lady's picture; the features are, just what your fancy imagines to be the most beauti∣ful
<PB N="3" REF="10"/>
in the world; and for seven or eight days, by your orders, I search'd the Court, the city, the country, for the charming original: my en∣deavours proved fruitless, and you begin to de∣spair of ever finding this lovely incognita; when one day, in hunting, led by the ardour of the chace, having stray'd from your suite, you find yourself near the park walls of this castle— hear the cry of distress, see women pursued by a huge and fierce boar. Fired with a gene∣rous alarm at their danger, you fly to their as∣sistance; to kill this monster, was but the work of a minute; but what a minute of delight, of transport! A young Lady from weariness and fright having fallen at the foot of a tree, pre∣sents to your eyes the very identical lovely ori∣ginal of the picture. Thus, in saving <HI>her</HI> life, your first interview was the most auspicious mo∣ment of your's.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Prince.</SPEAKER>
<P>I own, my dear Frederick, hitherto I have reason to be content; as yet, 'tis certain, my quality is a secret to Don Leopold and his.daughter; and as I was first introduced to them. by your name, they still imagine me to be Don Frederick. The amiable Seraphina listens to my vows with the most flattering complacency, approves my passion, answer's each gentle sigh, each tender look, with the sweet sympathy of
<PB N="4" REF="11"/>
dear affection; and, by her permission, I made a formal demand to her father of her hand in marriage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>Which he readily granted, not know∣ing you to be the Prince of Arragon.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Prince.</SPEAKER>
<P>The old Gentleman did not hesitate a moment; and this very day, the anniversary of my Birth Day, Don Leopold has fixed for the celebration of our marriage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then nothing but the joy of the night can exceed the happiness of the day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Prince.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! Frederick, this day may be most unhappy! Seraphina loves me, but before I wed her I am resolved to put her affection to the proof; if it cannot bear the trial, oh, Frede∣rick! what a severe stroke to a heart so ten∣der, so sensible, so passionate as mine!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, my Lord, I hope all for the best—Ha! ha! ha! I'm diverted even at the idea of Don Leopold's surprize and embar∣rassment when he finds that you're the Prince; I assure you he'll entertain you with such things as never yet reached a royal ear.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Prince.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, that I suppose: for the charac∣ter of my old Don, tho'rough, is noble, free and independent. Hush, here he comes; remember I am Don Frederick, and you are my atten∣dant.</P>

<SPEAKER>Don Leop.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(without)</STAGE>
<P>Be quiets—hold your tongues—say no more, it's all in vain—ridicu∣lous to propose it! No, no, no courts for me, <STAGE>(enters.)</STAGE> Ah! they did not tell me you were here.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Prince.</SPEAKER>
<P>But just arriv'd, Sir; you seem an∣gry.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Prince.</SPEAKER>
<P>What's the matter, Don Leopold?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leop.</SPEAKER>
<P>My daughter wants to carry me to Court.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Prince.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why not, Sir? A nobleman of your birth and distinction should not thus bury him∣self hi the country.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leop.</SPEAKER>
<P>In the country! I live upon my own estate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Prince.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, but from the character I have given of you, the Prince I'm sure would wish to be known to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leop.</SPEAKER>
<P>I tell you what, boy; I've as much respect for my Prince as you; I obey, I esteem, I love him; and were there a cause, the last drop of my blood should write my loyalty; I'd die to serve him. But I don't like new acquaintance: I am too old.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Prince.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet I will assure you, Don Leo∣pold, the Prince wishes for nothing more than to have you nearly attached to him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="6" REF="13"/>
<SPEAKER>Leop.</SPEAKER>
<P>Me! On what account?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Prince.</SPEAKER>
<P>To have in your rare and valuable character a man of candour and probity, incapa∣ble of falsehood, on whose honor, whose friend∣ship he might rely, and place an intire confi∣dence in his fidelity—you laugh!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leop.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes: Ha! ha! very good! the Prince wishes to have me near him, me, whom he never saw; because, forsooth, you have told him that I am a person of probity and candour!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Prince.</SPEAKER>
<P>Just so. I'll answer for your welcome, go when you please.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leop.</SPEAKER>
<P>Will you? first answer for my going for go I will not; no, no, he sees bad company enough already.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Prince.</SPEAKER>
<P>But—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leop.</SPEAKER>
<P>None of your buts! you are going to be my Son-in-law; take it once for all, I was never made for a courtier; I am a fantastical, ridiculous old fellow, that thinks noble birth wants no decoration of title; that a star upon a breast cannot give honor to a heart that's base, nor a ribbon dignity to a neck that per∣haps deserves a halter. Tho' I live at a great expence, I keep within my income; I have not use for more than half the servants I main∣tain, but then the other half I consider have use
<PB N="7" REF="14"/>
for me; and tho' I am a Lord, I am as free from debt as the poorest commoner.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Prince.</SPEAKER>
<P>You would indeed be an extraordi∣nary character at court.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leop.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, ay, Don Frederick, but I prefer being lodged in this old castle of mine here, to the honor of being inconveniently situated near a Prince; in one word, I'd rather walk about my park, gardens, and my own improvements, than to slide and amble through an antichamber, like a cypher of great importance, in a groupe of idle busy-bodies, female profligates, reverend atheists, mock patriots, and right honourable sharpers, the whole forming a villainous picture, a curious court calendar.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Prince.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then 'tis impossible to persuade you to accompany us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leop.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then don't attempt; ask a lover to resign his mistress, a lady to praise her rival, a lawyer to tell truth, and a Doctor to return his fee; but never ask me to go to court; you shall not change my mode of thinking, nor shall I try to alter your's.</P>

<P>Listen to the story of my falshood, and then abandon me to the keen remorse which must for ever punish and torment me. Yesterday, having obtain'd the consent of my Prince for our marriage, Frederick, says he, from the fidelity by which I know you are attached to me, I make no doubt of your con∣cern at my late inquietude of mind, and of your anxiety to know, and if in your power to remove the cause; cou'd you imagine it possi∣ble that the portrait of a young lady, whom I never saw nor know, has made such a deep im∣pression on my heart, that till I find her, till she's mine, your Prince must be unhappy! Here, behold, examine; see if nature ever form'd any thing so lovely, altogether such a combination of beauties! Here, take it, Frede∣rick, I trust this precious picture to your care. Reply not: fly, my dear friend; search every where, and, if possible, find this adorable wo∣man, this charming unknown! Judge, Sera∣phina, judge of my astonishment, my grief, when I beheld—these, these are the features that have caught the Prince's heart; there is the picture that he trusted to my care.</P>

<P>And which fortune has thrown into the hands of the Prince; but instead of repay∣ing his confidence with fidelity, instead of throw∣ing myself at his feet and confessing that I was his rival, I endeavour'd to conceal my embar∣rassment, and turn his passion aside; with a forc'd laugh I affected to rally his love for a person unknown; and, to cool his transport, urg'd that the picture might have flatter'd, that the original might not be living, that those fine features perhaps never existed but in the paint∣er's fancy. In short, my perfidious jealousy left nothing unsaid that might prevent his cu∣riosity

<P>Mad with the fear of having my treasure snatch'd from me, I flew to your fa∣ther and urg'd him to hasten our marriage; I summon'd all my dissimulation to master my anxiety before him; but when I approach'd your presence, that unsuspecting innocence, that air of frankness and sincerity, even tri∣umph'd over your charms; the tender and in∣genuous joy you express'd at seeing me, when heaven itself had design'd you for a throne, confounded my intentions; I had no longer power to disguise the cruel conflict that agitated my soul. You, lovely Seraphina, perceived my emotions; your kind solicitude has produced this explanation; there now remains no more for me but to quit your presence, and for ever banish from your sight my shame, my guilt, and my confusion.</P>

<P>A pretty way of fhewing it, to de∣prive you of a crown! O fie! He ought to be asham'd of himself.

Oh Sir, if you were but to see her! Such an air, such a charming

<P>Oh, Madam, do not doubt a pas∣sion the most tender and sincere.</P>

<SPEAKER>Sera.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I shou'd have thought that the pursuit of a great Prince, the heir of Arragon, would have taken a nobler course, than to seek an humble recluse like me, and receive honour by conferring it, with his addresses, on some Princess, whose birth might dignify the throne that waits him; and whose alliance might ex∣tend his fame, and add strength to the interest of his kingdom.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Prince.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis for you that throne's reserv'd, which must receive lustre from your beauty. Doubtless 'twas providence that threw your picture in my way, that now sent me hither in the very moment you were going to be lost to me for ever! Heaven ordain'd you mine, and let your consent confirm its dispensation.</P>

<PB N="33" REF="40"/>
<SPEAKER>Sera.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, it wou'd be an idle affectation in me, to plead insensibility to the merits of a Prince, exalted by his virtues, even above the splendor of his birth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Prince.</SPEAKER>
<P>Amiable Lady! A thousand, thou∣sand thanks for this generous frankness! But stop not there; oh, make me happy—declare that Frederick has not touch'd your heart, that you consented to marry him without love as without repugnance, free from inclination, but as he was the choice of your father.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sera.</SPEAKER>
<P>The choice of my heart.</P>

<P>There my Frederick is enthron'd, ne∣ver to be dispossessed.</P>

<P>Oh rapture! <STAGE>(Aside.)</STAGE> What, a sub∣ject preferr'd to me?</P>

<P>In pity, Sir, do not force me to vio∣late the respect that your rank demands; what can I say more?

<P>My Lord, I must entreat your pardon for some things I have said, which, on recollection. I think I might as well have left alone.</P>

<P>Will you? Ah, my dear Lord, the Court now wou'd be a mortal restraint upon one of my age and humour. Peace, health, and an elbow chair, is all that an old man ought to wish for.
