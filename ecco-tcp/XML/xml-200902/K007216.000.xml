<P>Who could divine that my brother would return from Naples, without giving me any notice of his intention; and that he should come at so cri∣tical a juncture?</P>

<P>You know, sister, when our father died, a very considerable succession devolved to me: however, being then with my regiment at Naples, I did not come to take possession, but left every thing to your care and management.</P>

<P>Pray hear me out.

<P>You are positive you saw Don <HI>Carlos?</HI></P>

<P>Positive. Now, as I am shortly to be married to my cousin, it is highly incumbent upon me to render myself acceptable to my uncle; and, I am certain, I can do nothing more likely to please him, than taking vengance on Don <HI>Carlos.</HI> I therefore expect that you will accompany me to the place where the servant is ready to lead us.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Car.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your brother!</P>

<SPEAKER>Aur.</SPEAKER>
<P>I had no notice of his coming; otherwise I should have apprised you, that you might have deferred your journey, at least for some time.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Car.</SPEAKER>
<P>It will be impossible for me to stay in your house then.</P>

<P>This house consists, like many others in Madrid, but of two stories: the upper, I occupy myself; the lower, which, on my father's death, I found I had no occasion for, I let to one Octa∣vio, a wine-merchant; on this division of the building, a back staircase, which made the com∣munication between the two stories, with a small closet adjoining, became useless; and, by mutual
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>consent, was stopped up, by a partition on the side of the apartment below, as well as on this. When I had thoughts of bringing you back to Madrid, it occurred to me, that the partition on my side might again be secretly opened, and pre∣pared in such a manner, as would effectually screen you from any search, should it ever be suspected that you were in the house: accordingly, the thing is done, <HI>(pushes back a pannel,</HI> and this moveable pannel will, when you please, admit you into a place of security; and, when fastened on the in∣—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Car.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Aurora,</HI> I have too grateful a sense of your kindness, to avail myself of a retreat, which must expose you. In this emergency, the best way is to return to the place from whence I came.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Musk.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's my advice, Sir; let us go to the inn directly, take our mules, and set off.—Ladies, my master, and I, have the honour of wishing you all health and happiness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aur.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! hold, Don <HI>Carlos,</HI> you must not go.—You have, by some accident or other, been seen, since you came to Madrid, by young <HI>Ferdinand.</HI> His servant dogg'd you to your inn; and he, and my brother, are just gone in search of you.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Knocking.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, heavens, Ma'am!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Car.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't be alarm'd; we have arms to de∣send ourselves.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Musk.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, ladies, don't be alarmed. We have arms to defend ourselves.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aur.</SPEAKER>
<P>Talk not of defence, I beseech you; but in pity to me, go into the place I have shewn you: and we will consult together for your better and safer accommodation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Musk.</SPEAKER>
<P>What the lady says, Sir, is just and rea∣sonable—I have considered the matter; and, if
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>you don't do it, I'll give myself up to justice immediately, and try to be admitted king's evi∣dence.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Oct.</SPEAKER>
<P>I understand, Don <HI>Pedro,</HI> you have had a scuffle in the street; you are known; and the per∣son you have wounded, is the Duke of Medina him∣self; who was going, incog, to the lodgings of a courtezan in the quarter where you affaulted him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Ped.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fatal accident!—the Duke himself!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Fer.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why do you stand like one confounded? Do you not hear what Signor <HI>Octavio</HI> says? You
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>and your family must be gone from hence; I will stay behind, and see your lodgings let with all possi∣ble diligence, to prevent suspicion of your being in town.</P>

<P>If you will commit the key of your apart∣ments to my charge, I will do my utmost to quash whatever enquiries may be made after you.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Ped.</SPEAKER>
<P>To tell you that Don <HI>Ferdinand</HI> came hither just now, to desire I would accompany him on an affair of honour; that we have missed the person we went in search of, and by mistake affulted the Duke of Medina.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aur.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Sir, and what—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Ped.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must withdraw immediately to a place of safety: a coach is at the door, and I will see you and your maid safely lodged in the Ursuline nun∣nery.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aur.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Ped.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have told you that my safety requires I should absent myself, and I will not leave you behind.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leon.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'm sure I'll not go into a nunnery.</P>

<P><HI>Octavio,</HI> your servant, alas!</P>

<P>I find then, Sir, your nephew has told me all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Guz.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am come to talk to you about these lodgings. I suppose you would let this tenement a
<PB N="13" REF="12"/>bargain, to any one, that would take it off your hands?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Oct.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be sure, Sir, on an occasion like this—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Guz.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, if twenty dollars a month will be sufficient, I will e'en hire the premises for my own use, and take possession directly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Oct.</SPEAKER>
<P>Surely, Sir, twenty dollars are too little.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Guz.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but consider, it's doing the young man a favor; for seeing my family in the house, would prevent further enquiries, and satisfy the police, that <HI>Don Pedro</HI>—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Oct.</SPEAKER>
<P>I really think, Sir, that, as your chief mo∣tive for taking the apartment is to serve Don <HI>Pedro,</HI> the sooner you and your family come into it, the better.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Guz.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am of that opinion too; and as very luckily my time is just up where I now lodge, and I want some larger rooms, in consequence of my daughter's marriage, which I shall shortly celebrate, I shall send to you for the key, within this half hour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Oct.</SPEAKER>
<P>You will oblige me, Don <HI>Guzman,</HI> by charg∣ing yourself with the key now; for having a small vineyard near town, I have shut up my apartments below, and sent all my servants, men and women, to work there.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Guz.</SPEAKER>
<P>And you want to go yourself, is it not so? Well, well, go your ways, and mind your business; I'll take the key from you.</P>

<P>Did you hear all that has passed, <HI>Mus∣kato?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Musk.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir, every word of it; but don't grow desperate; things are not so bad as we expected; this is a respite at least, if not a reprieve.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="14" REF="13"/>
<SPEAKER>D. Car.</SPEAKER>
<P>A respite! Has not Don <HI>Guzman</HI> taken this house over my head, and am I not by that means in the hands of my most cruel and avowed enemy?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Musk.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir, but he does not know you are in his hands.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Car.</SPEAKER>
<P>The worst on't is, that the merchant below is gone out, with his family, and has lock'd up the doors: so that our retreat is stopped. By forcing the lock of the door, we may get out before our enemy returns: I know the danger of shewing myself at this hour, but—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Musk.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, Sir, nothing is so dangerous as stay∣ing here, if we can get out; so, pray let us force the door; I have broke a lock before now, upon a less justifiable occasion; and I'll do my endeavour to master this— <STAGE>(goes to the door, and returns in a fright.)</STAGE> Quick, Sir, quick; back to our hiding place.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Car.</SPEAKER>
<P>What's the matter?</P>
</SP>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Laz.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay; how do you like them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Beat.</SPEAKER>
<P>Like them, not at all. In the first place, that door has not common sense in it; then the stairs are the wrong way; and the windows! mercy on us, what pigeon-holes! and a mile and a half from the ground.</P>

<P>If the kennel was mine, I should think of nothing but pulling it down, and selling the rub∣bish to the best bidder. Take a ready furnish'd house, indeed!—</P>

<P>Mrs. Beatrice is difficult to please, Ma'am.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>So she is indeed—my father tells me, Laza∣rillo, that it is to please your master, he takes these lodgings; and I suppose it is by his desire that we come to them so suddenly. Do you know the rea∣son of Don <HI>Ferdinand</HI>'s extraordinary attachment?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Laz.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Ma'am, I am generally pretty well acquainted with my master's secrets.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>I beg your pardon; I did not know it was any secret, or I should not have asked.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Oh, Ma'am, there's no secret; that is to say, no absolute secret: but, as far as this here, Ma'am, the air and situation, I believe—</P>

<P>In short, Ma'am, Signor <HI>Lazarillo</HI> is a per∣son who seldom chuses to seem ignorant of any thing. Did your master ever tell you why he liked these longings.</P>

<P>O fye, Ma'am, to tell me so, on the eve of your marriage, as it were.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>'Tis the thought of that makes me me∣lancholy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Beat.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is it indeed? I'm sure then, Ma'am, you and I are of very different dispositions—I wish I was going to be married; the deuce a thing should I think of, but that would make me very glad.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>How, Beatrice! suppose you were going to set out upon a journey, which presented you with the most beautiful prospect; but on the first ad∣vances you made, you found yourself on the brink of a precipice, what would you do?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Beat.</SPEAKER>
<P>A very great precipice, do you mean; or, only a little sort of a declivity?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pshaw! I'm not in a jesting humour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Beat.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but, Ma'am, let me understand you.—You ask me, if I was going to set out on a jour∣ney, which presented me with the most beautiful prospect; and, on the first advances I made, I found myself on the brink of a precipice—what I would do?</P>

<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>I say then, <HI>Beatrice,</HI> my cousin, Don <HI>Fer∣dinand,</HI> no doubt imagines that marriage is a dis∣pensation from the trifling duties, exacted by com∣plaisance, since he already begins to fail in those marks of tenderness and regard, I expected to find from him—he forgets that love is nourished by attention; and that the slightest negligence kills it.</P>
</SP>

<P>Ah, dear <HI>Marcella,</HI> did you know how uneasy you make me by this kind of discourse—</P>
</SP>

<P>And why uneasy?—what I spoke, was said to <HI>Beatrice</HI>—and you need take no notice of it, as you need not be supposed to overhear.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Beat.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's right Ma'am—and to let you know another thing, Sir, you are not to take the words out of my mouth—my lady spoke to me; and it's my part to answer—and here's the way I do it—I sup∣pose, Ma'am Don <HI>Ferdinand</HI> is like the rest of his sex; who for the most part, follow women as they hunt hares and foxes; when the animal's catched, the sport is over.—I once had a sweetheart myself, Ma'am, that used to call me his queen, and his Venus and his Adonis—To be sure I used him very ill, then he used to be so melancholy, so pathetical, so poeti∣cal. I remember his once repeating to me these very moving lines—</P>
<Q><PB N="18" REF="17"/>
<L>When first I attempted your pity to move,</L>
<L>Why seem'd you so deaf to my prayers;</L>
<L>Perhaps it was right to dissemble your love,</L>
<L>But why did you kick me down stairs?</L></Q>
<P>Were they not, Ma'am, very moving? oh dear—Come, Ma'am, he, looks penitent; give him your hand to kiss, and tell him you are friends with him.—Look you there, Sir, I knew it—There's nothing does with us, like a little coaxing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Fer.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your father, my dear <HI>Marcella,</HI> is determi∣ned to have our wedding a publick one; and Satur∣day next he assures me, shall be the happy day. Just as I left home, a good many of your things were brought, which I have ordered to be sent here, with some boxes of rich wine, and foreign sweetmeats, for the ball I intended to give a select number of our friends, to-morrow night. In the mean time, I'll step back to the old lodging, to see things properly taken care of.—<HI>Lazarillo,</HI> bring up those parcels.— And you, Mrs. <HI>Beatrice,</HI> will not find yourself forgot∣ten.</P>

<P>This is the servant of Don <HI>Carlos;</HI> I catched him just now in the street, measuring the outside of our house, with his eyes, from top to bottom.—I know his master is at present in Ma∣drid; and I suspect, this emissary of his was not lurking about this neighbourhood for any good purpose:—rather, perhaps in meditation of some farther destruction of our family;—for, searching his pockets, we found a pistol.</P>

<P>Oh, very well; I warrant you I'll find him: I hear tales of a very ugly nature from one side and the other, of men, and women being con∣cealed in the house.</P>

<P>'Tis most certain, Sir, that I met a strange man in the house last night; but I don't pretend to determine how he got in.</P>

<SPEAKER>D. Guz.</SPEAKER>
<P>My daughter says there was a strange woman; and, for any thing that appears to the contrary, both the lurking toads may be in the house still; and, if somebody does not ferret them out, we may have our throats cut one of these nights, when we are asleep in our beds, and dreaming of no such matter.</P>

<P>Oh, Sir, I can't think they are in the house still.</P>

<P>This is very pretty behaviour, I pro∣test; however, Sir, since you are so violent, I will not contend with you at present; I'll take this room in my way back: and will you, Don <HI>Pedro,</HI> be so obliging as to accompany me; while I search the rest of the apartments.</P>
