<HEAD>The PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Reader will easily perceive these Verses were begun, when my Heart was gayer, than it has been of late; and finish'd in Hours of the deepest Melancholy.</P>
<P>I hope the World will do me the Justice to be∣lieve, that no part of this flows from any <HI>real Anger</HI> against the <HI>Lady,</HI> to whom it is inscrib'd. Whatever undeserv'd Severities I may have re∣ceiv'd at her Hands, wou'd she deal so candidly as to acknowledge Truth, she very well knows, by an Experience of many Years, that I have ever behaved myself towards her, like one, who thought it his Duty to support with Patience all Afflictions from that Quarter. Indeed if I had not been capable of <HI>forgiving</HI> a <HI>Mother,</HI> I must have blush'd to receive Pardon <HI>myself</HI> at the Hands of my <HI>Sovereign.</HI></P>
<P>Neither to say Truth, were the manner of my Birth <HI>All,</HI> shou'd I have any Reason from com∣plaint—when I am a little disposed to a gay turn of Thinking, I consider, as I was a <HI>De-relict</HI> from my Cradle, I have the Honour of a <HI>lawful Claim</HI> to the best Protection in <HI>Europe.</HI> For being a <HI>Spot</HI> of <HI>Earth,</HI> to which no body <HI>pre∣tends</HI> a <HI>Title,</HI> I devolve naturally upon the <HI>KING,</HI> as one of the <HI>Rights</HI> of his <HI>Royalty.</HI></P>
<P><PB REF="4"/>
While I presume to name <HI>his MAJESTY,</HI> I look back, with Confusion, upon the <HI>Mercy</HI> I have lately experienc'd, because it is impossible to <HI>remember</HI> it, but <HI>with</HI> something I would fain <HI>forget;</HI> for the sake of my future Peace, and Alleviation of my past Misfortune.</P>
<P>I owe my Life to the <HI>Royal Pity,</HI> if a Wretch can, with Propriety, be said to <HI>live,</HI> whose Days are fewer than his Sorrows; and to whom <HI>Death</HI> had been but a <HI>Redemption</HI> from <HI>Misery.</HI></P>
<P>But I will <HI>suffer</HI> my <HI>Pardon,</HI> as my <HI>Punish∣ment,</HI> till that Life, which has so graciously been given me, shall become considerable enough <HI>not to be useless</HI> in his Service, to whom it was for∣feited.</P>
<P>Under Influence of these Sentiments, with which his <HI>MAJESTY's</HI> great Goodness has in∣spired me, I consider my Loss of Fortune, and Dignity, as my Happiness; to which, as I was born without Ambition, I am thrown from them without repining.—Possessing those Advanta∣ges, my Care had been, perhaps, but how to <HI>enjoy</HI> Life; by the want of them I am taught this nobler Lesson, to study how to <HI>deserve</HI> it.</P>

<L>No tenth Transmitter of a foolish Face.</L>
<L>His daring Hope, no Sire's Example bounds:</L>
<L>His first-born Lights no Prejudice con¦founds.</L>
<L>He, kindling from within, requires no Flame</L>
<L>He glories in a <HI>Bastard</HI>'s glowing Name.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>BORN to himself, by no Possession led,</L>
<L>In Freedom foster'd, and by Fortune fed;</L>
<L>Nor Guides, nor Rules, his sov'reign Choic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> controul,</L>
<L>His Body independent, as his Soul.</L>
<L>Loos'd to the World's wide Range,—en¦joyn'd no Aim;</L>
<L>Prescrib'd no Duty, and assign'd no Name:</L>
<L>Nature's unbounded Son, he stands alone,</L>
<L>His Heart unbyass'd, and his Mind his own</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O <HI>Mother,</HI> yet <HI>no</HI> Mother!—'tis to you,</L>
<L>My Thanks for such distinguish'd Claims are due.</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="7"/>
You, unenslav'd to Nature's narrow Laws,</L>
<L>Warm Championess for <HI>Freedom</HI>'s sacred Cause,</L>
<L>From all the dry Devoirs of Blood and Line,</L>
<L>From Ties maternal, moral and divine,</L>
<L>Discharg'd my grasping Soul; push'd me from Shore,</L>
<L>And launch'd me into Life without an Oar.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>WHAT had I lost, if conjugally kind,</L>
<L>By Nature hating, yet by Vows confin'd,</L>
<L>Untaught the matrimonial Bounds to slight,</L>
<L>And coldly conscious of a Husband's Right,</L>
<L>You had <HI>faint-drawn</HI> me with a <HI>Form</HI> alone,</L>
<L>A lawful Lump of Life by Force your own!</L>
<L>Then, while your backward Will re∣trench'd Desire,</L>
<L>And unconcurring Spirits lent no Fire,</L>
<L>I had been born your dull, domestic <HI>Heir;</HI></L>
<L>Load of your Life, and Motive of your Care;</L>

Perhaps been poorly rich, and meanly great;</L>
<L>The Slave of Pomp, a Cypher in the State;</L>
<L>Lordly neglectful of a Worth unknown,</L>

<L>Nor taught by Wisdom, how to ballance Will,</L>

<L>But thought to <HI>purpose,</HI> and to <HI>act</HI> were <HI>one;</HI></L>

But now expos'd and shrinking from distress,</L>
<L>I flie to Shelter, while the Tempests press;</L>
<L>My Muse to Grief resigns the varying Tone,</L>
<L>The Raptures languish, and the Numbers groan.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O Memory!—thou Soul of Joy, and Pain!</L>
<L>Thou Actor of our Passions o'er again!</L>
<L>Why dost thou aggravate the Wretches Woe?</L>
<L>Why add continuous Smart to ev'ry Blow?</L>
<L>Few are my Joys; alas! how soon forgot!</L>
<L>On that <HI>kind</HI> Quarter thou invad'st me not,</L>
<L>While sharp, and numberless my Sorrows fall;</L>
<L>Yet thou repeat'st, and multiply'st 'em all!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Is Chance a Guilt? that my disast'rous Heart,</L>
<L>For Mischief never meant, must ever smart</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="10"/>
Can Self-defence be Sin—Ah, plead no more!</L>
<L>What tho' no purpos'd Malice stain'd thee o'er?</L>
<L>Had Heav'n befriended thy unhappy Side,</L>
<L>Thou had'st not been provok'd—Or <HI>Thou</HI> had'st died.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>FAR be the Guilt of homeshed Blood from All,</L>
<L>On whom unsought, embroiling Dangers fall!</L>
<L>Still the pale <HI>Dead</HI> revives, and lives to me,</L>
<L>To me! thro' <HI>Pity</HI>'s Eye condemn'd to see.</L>
<L>Remembrance veils his Rage, but swells his Fate;</L>
<L>Griev'd I forgive, and am grown cool too late.</L>
<L>Young, and unthoughtful then; who knows, one Day,</L>
<L>What ripening Vertues might have made their Way!</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="11"/>
He might have liv'd, till Folly died in Shame,</L>
<L>Till kindling Wisdom felt a Thirst for Fame.</L>
<L>He might perhaps his Country's Friend have prov'd;</L>
<L>Been happy, gen'rous, candid, and belov'd.</L>
<L>He might have sav'd some Worth, now doom'd to fall;</L>
<L>And I, perchance in him, have <HI>murder'd</HI> all.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O Fate of late Repentance! always vain:</L>
<L>Thy Remedies but lull undying Pain.</L>
<L>Where shall my Hope find Rest?—No Mother's Care</L>
<L>Shielded my Infant Innocence with Prayer:</L>
<L>No Father's Guardian Hand my Youth maintain'd,</L>
<L>Call'd forth my Vertues, or from Vice re∣strain'd.</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="12"/>
Is it not time to snatch some pow'rful Arm,</L>
<L>First to advance, then screen from future Harm?</L>
<L>Am I return'd from Death, to live in Pain?</L>
<L>Or wou'd <HI>Imperial Pity</HI> save in vain?</L>
<L>Distrust it not—What blame can <HI>Mercy</HI> find,</L>
<L>Which gives at once a Life, and rears a Mind?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>MOTHER, miscall'd, Farewel—of Soul severe,</L>
<L>This sad Reflection yet may force one Tear:</L>
<L>All I was wretched by to you I ow'd,</L>
<L>Alone from Strangers ev'ry Comfort flow'd!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>LOST to the Life <HI>you</HI> gave, <HI>Your</HI> Son no more,</L>
<L>And now <HI>adopted,</HI> who was <HI>doom'd</HI> before,</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="13"/>
<HI>New-born,</HI> I may a nobler Mother Claim,</L>
<L>But dare not whisper her Immortal <HI>Name?</HI></L>
<L>Supreamly Lovely and Serenely Great!</L>
<L>Majestick <HI>Mother</HI> of a kneeling <HI>State!</HI></L>
<L>QUEEN of a People's Hearts, who ne'er before</L>
<L>Agreed—Yet now with one Consent <HI>adore!</HI></L>
<L>One Contest yet remains in this Desire,</L>
<L>Who most shall give Applause, where all Admire.</L>
