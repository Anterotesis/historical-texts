<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>FROM Dryden's period to our present days,</L>
<L>Thus would be-critics censure modern plays;</L>
<L>Some are too dull, without intrigue, or jest—</L>
<L>And some mere speaking pantomimes at best;</L>
<L>That living authors are by dead surpast,</L>
<L>So he must write the worst, who writes the last—</L>
<L>Still each new drama captiously they blame,</L>
<L>And, though the town be pleas'd, deny it same.</L>
<L>Should this decision be allow'd as just,</L>
<L>The bays denied the Bard, may grace his bust!</L>
<L>But if this taste for antiques we pursue,</L>
<L>Age may improve wit, wine, and women too.</L>
<L>One <HI>old opinion</HI> we would still retain,</L>
<L>The right that England has to rule the main!</L>
<L>Long as the sea shall fence our envied land,</L>
<L>Long as our navy shall the sea command;</L>
<L>So long shall Howe's, St. Vincent's, Duncan's name,</L>
<L>Be grav'd by memory on the rock of same!</L>
<L>The page of hist'ry shall their deeds repeat,</L>
<L>With Britain's triumph, and the foe's defeat.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But ah! the pensive muse, with tearful eye,</L>
<L>Views glory's brightest triumph with a sigh!</L>
<L>And midst the shouts victorious fleets attend</L>
<L>Mourns o'er the ashes of an honoured friend,</L>
<L>Who in his country's quarrel fought and bled,</L>
<L>By England numbered with her patriot dead!</L>
<L>May war's alarms midst rival nations cease,</L>
<L>And all embrace that lovely stranger—Peace,</L>
<L>Whose olive branch once planted by her hand,</L>
<L>Shall bless a loyal, brave, and happy land.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>This night our Author's hopes on you are placed,</L>
<L>His former efforts by your smiles were graced;</L>
<L>To your decree submissively he bends,</L>
<L>Trusting his judges will be found his friends.</L>

<HEAD>SCENE I.—<HI>An Apartment in Greville House; Servants talking without.</HI></HEAD>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> Valet, Butler, Coachman, Cook, <HI>and</HI> Footmen.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>VALET.</SPEAKER>
<P>SILENCE, I say! Why, you keep as loud a gabbling as if you were settling the balance of Europe in the lobby of the House of Commons. Order, I say—the question is this. Our old master being dead, and our young one expected every moment from abroad, ought we, when he arrives, to laugh or cry? Hear the Cook!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cook.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, I thinks, that for the death of an old master, a little dripping from the eyes would be quite natural.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Valet.</SPEAKER>
<P>It may be natural, master Cook; but lord bless you, the genteel feel of your tip top folks, is no more like nature, than one of your fine kabobbed fricassees is to plain roast and <HI>taties.</HI> Besides, when a man leaves behind him a good ten thousand a year, I think it quite natural for the heir to laugh. What say you, Coachy?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="2" REF="5"/>
<SPEAKER>Coach.</SPEAKER>
<P>I pulls with you, Mr. Valet—young master must in the main be glad, for we all know that the old gemman seeing that he run skittish, kept him upon low provender beyond sea. So my verdict is, Mr. Butler, that we all smiles agreeably.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Butler.</SPEAKER>
<P>So say I. Dam'me, I'll look as pleased as punch, ha! ha!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Valet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Softly. And will you, sir, who have but thirty pounds a-year, dare to be as pleased at seeing your master, as I, who have fifty? No, no —subordination is every thing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Coach.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ecod, the best reason we should not be sorry, is, that the old Buck left us no legacies.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Valet.</SPEAKER>
<P>That settles it. <STAGE>(all laugh.)</STAGE> <STAGE>(a knocking at the door.)</STAGE> Here he comes—I am to look most pleased, and stand in the front. Back a little, Coachy, and remember I am to speak.</P>

<STAGE><HI>Enter Mr. and Mrs.</HI> Greville.</STAGE>

<SPEAKER>Grev.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why this boisterous mirth?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Coach.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are to speak, you know.</P>
<STAGE>(to the Valet.)</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Grev.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is it thus you honor the memory of your departed master? My love, welcome to England, and to my father's house. If I can trust my heart, the greatest happiness I shall feel from prosperity, (should it await us,) will be in placing my Maria in the elevated station her virtues will illumine.</P>

<STAGE>Sally, <HI>in a travelling dress, speaks as she enters.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sally.</SPEAKER>
<P>Travelling indeed! nothing but extortion I declare—Such a gang of them! First, in comes the bill; then remember the Waiter—John Ostler,
<PB N="3" REF="6"/>sir—the Chambermaid, ma'am—don't forget poor Boots—I am the Porter—the Post Boy, your ho∣nor—so that your hand keeps constantly moving up and down, up and down, like the great lump of wood at Chelsea waterworks.— <STAGE>(<HI>the</HI> Servants <HI>nod and wink to her.</HI>)</STAGE>—What are you all nodding and winking at? why don't you set chairs?— <STAGE>(Servants <HI>set chairs.</HI>)</STAGE>—Now, go along all of you, and see the luggage unpacked— <STAGE>(Servants <HI>surprized</HI>)</STAGE>— why don't you go?</P>
<STAGE>(Greville <HI>waves his hand.</HI>)</STAGE>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sally.</SPEAKER>
<P>A parcel of lazy chaps. I dare say—but I'll make them stir their stumps. Well, here we are at last. Oh gemini gig! how my poor bones do ache!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Greville.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Greville, excuse her familia∣rity —she has lived with me from my infancy, and is, indeed, a faithful, affectionate creature.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sally.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, that I am. Oh bless its pretty face!</P>
<STAGE>(patting her mistress's cheek.)</STAGE>

<P>Yes.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Grev.</SPEAKER>
<P>You look uneasy, Charles.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Grev.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis for thy sake, Maria. Between hope and fear my mind is tortured: when I reflect on my father's determined, but just, resentment at my dissipated conduct while in England—so deter∣mined, that I dared not acquaint him of my union with my adored Maria—then I fear that he died without blessing me, and has estranged me from his house and fortune. When I reflect that I am
<PB N="4" REF="7"/>perhaps destitute of the means of supporting thee —surrounded by creditors— <STAGE>(a knocking at the door.)</STAGE></P>

<P>Your name, friend, and business?</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Nich.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, my name is—so, there <HI>is</HI> a lady in the case—my name, sir, is Nicholas Rue, and my business will be explained by this letter. <STAGE>(Greville <HI>reads the letter, and seems elated with pleasure.</HI>)</STAGE> Now to have a peep, <STAGE>(puts on his spectacles.)</STAGE> Eh! as I hope to live these fifty years—Miss Egerton. How my master will be surprised!</P>

<SPEAKER>Grev.</SPEAKER>
<P>What happy tidings! present my best respects to your master—I will wait on him im∣mediately.</P>

<SPEAKER>Sally </SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(pouting.)</STAGE>
<P>Tolerable indeed! Oh, Mr.Eger∣ton, her noble brother behaved different: He never thought me tolerable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Grev.</SPEAKER>
<P>For shame, Sally!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sally.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so it is a shame that a poor servant should be out of her wits for joy at hearing her dear lady's good fortune? Sir, I has as much right to be happy as you <HI>has,</HI> and I will be happy, tho' you make me cry all day for it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Grev.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Well—loving Maria atones for a thousand faults.</P>

<SPEAKER>Sally. </SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(advancing.)</STAGE>
<P>Know him! he is the blackest villain, sir—It was he who ruined her dear brother, and drove him from England, to wander, nobody knows where.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Grev.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, Greville! I doubt the goodness of that fortune to which he is harbinger.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Grev.</SPEAKER>
<P>You alarm me; but I will hasten to him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sally.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I'll go with you, and, by gemini gig, I'll give it him—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Grev.</SPEAKER>
<P>For heaven's sake, be quiet! Droop not my dearest love! 'Tis prosperity awaits us. I go

<SPEAKER>Mrs. Grev.</SPEAKER>
<P>Heigho!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sally.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't sigh, dear lady! I know from ex∣perience riches don't give happiness. When poor, I was happy, and now that I am independent, having £.3 10s. a year in the consolidated real grand Bank of England, yet I'm not happy; but I shall be so when my darling mistress is a great lady, and her dear brother comes home a general.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Grev.</SPEAKER>
<P>Poor Egerton! What perils has he not encountered for my sake—perhaps his precious life—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sally.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, no, no—take comfort, for sure no∣body wou'd go to kill so handsome and good a creature as he is—besides, ma'am, has not he a mole on his right arm? Was he not born with a cawl? And has he not a pocket-piece that I got conjured?</P>

<P>That the sister of Eger∣ton shou'd be the lady—this is news indeed. They must be married, and then my old rogue of a master gets the estate, and poor I, only a thousand pounds for assisting in the roguery; but 'tis a snug sum.</P>

<P>Which will? why, you are a wag, Ni∣cholas. Not his <HI>second</HI> will, which you burnt. Ha! ha! you are a wag.

<P>Yes, sir; and says I to them—you know my master's plate was found at the bottom of your trunks, (which you know, sir, I put there myself,) and the law has condemned you to be hang'd— now your kind master has got your sentence softened to a <HI>mere</HI> trip to Botany Bay.</P>

On canvass it would fetch twenty gui∣neas, but on the shoulders of a poor soldier nobody will give sixpence for it—throw this

<Q>Mr. Pratt has introduced to a numerous set of readers a novel that has the merit of being at once tender, pathetic, and full of love; and, which may be a more uncommon circumstance, of love mixed with the greatest discre∣tion.
<BIBL><HI>Monthly Review, May</HI> 1797.</BIBL></Q>
<Q>In the volumes before us, there are several beautiful and affecting strokes of nature.
<BIBL><HI>Analytical Review, April</HI> 1797.</BIBL></Q>
<P N="3">3. A GOSSIP's STORY and LEGENDARY TALE. By Mrs. WEST, Author of Advantages of Education, &amp;c. In two Volumes 12mo. Price 7s. in Boards.</P>
<Q>We can recommend this story as uniting to a great degree of interest the rarer qualities of good sense, and an accurate knowledge of mankind. The grammatical errors and vulgarisms which disgrace many even of our most celebrated novels, have here no place; and several of the shorter poe∣tical pieces interspersed through the work, have very considerable merit. Amusement is combined with utility, and fiction is inlisted in the cause of virtue and practical philosophy.

<P N="7">7. BIOGRAPHICAL, LITERARY, and POLI∣TICAL ANECDOTES, of-several of the most EMI∣NENT PERSONS of the PRESENT AGE; particu∣larly the Dukes of Grafton, Leeds, Dorset, and Rutland; Lords Townshend, Orford, Marchmont, Mansfield, Camden, Temple, Nugent, and Sackville; Bishops of Hereford and Ossory; Right Hon. George Grenville, Charles Townshend; Sir James Caldwell, Sir Grey Cooper, Sir John Dalrymple, Serjeant Adair, Dr. Frank∣lin, and many others. Never before printed; in Three Volumes. Price 18s.</P>
<P>The Monthly Critics, who have already reviewed this new work, speak of it in the following words:</P>
<P>The writers of the Monthly Revicw for last month say, "We cannot dismiss these volumes without observing, that they contain a considerable portion of political information. The work will, by its discerning readers, be characterized as highly interesting; and it will prove particularly so to those who still remember the times to which the anecdotes here recorded are referable. To the future historian also it will afford much assistance, by con∣tributing, in many instances, towards the means of information, which, but for publications of this kind, might be utterly consigned to oblivion.</P>
<P>The writers of the Analytical Review for January last, say, "The work before us will be found particularly interesting to those who wish to obtain an idea of the management of state affairs in this country, during the whole of the present reign."</P>
<P>The writers of the Gentleman's Magazine for January last, say, "These volumes are written by the author of the Anecdotes of the late Earl of Chatham, and are not inferior to that work either in interest or intelligence. Those persons who are fond of reading the political anecdotes of their own times, particularly from the year 1760 to the year 1780, (an important pe∣riod), which, the writer assures us, have not been printed, will receive fiom this work much pleasure and information."</P>
<P>The writers of the European Magazine, say, "The editor of these volumes is entitled to the thanks of the public, for preserving many facts which otherwise might have fallen into oblivion. The reader will find entertain∣ment and information in them, and the future investigator of the acts of the present reign will meet with some valuable materials to exercise his sagacity upon, which are to be no where else found, and which will serve to guide him through the obscure paths of political finesse."</P>
<P N="8">8. The ANECDOTES of LORD CHATHAM's LIFE. The Sixth Edition. In Three Volumes, 8vo. Price 18s. Boards.</P>
<Q>The author has made a valuable Collection of Anecdotes, especially of the late and most conspicuous part of Lord Chatham's Life; and of other matters connected with it. He says he is not conscious of having advanced one falsehood: We give credit to his declaration, having found no cause to doubt it.
<BIBL><HI>Monthly Review, May</HI> 1792.</BIBL></Q>
<Q><PB REF="77"/><P>A greater number of curious and interesting anecdotes, concerning public affairs, have not appeared since the days of Sir William Temple, than are to be found in this work.</P>
<P>We cannot dismiss this article without acknowledging, that it throws a great and new light upon the occurences and events of more than half a century of our history.</P>
<BIBL><HI>Gent. Mag. Aug.</HI> 1793.</BIBL></Q>
<P N="9">9. A RESIDENCE in FRANCE, during the Years 1792, 3, 4, &amp; 5; described in a Series of Letters from an ENGLISH LADY, with general and incidental Re∣marks on the French Character and Manners. Prepared for the Press by JOHN GIFFORD Esq. In Two Volumes, 8vo. Price 14s. Boards. The Third Edition.</P>
<Q>It is only justice to say, that the style is as polished as the matter is interesting and important: nor have we any doubt that the book will remain a permanent monument of the taste and talents of the writer.

<P N="10">10. GLEANINGS THROUGH WALES, HOL∣LAND, and WESTPHALIA; with Views of Peace and War at Home and Abroad. To which is added, HUMANITY; or, The Rights of Nature: A Poem. Revised and corrected. By Mr. PRATT. In Three Volumes, 8vo. Price One Guinea in Boards. Third Edition.</P>
<Q>We have found so many lively and pleasant exhibitions of manners, so many amusing and interesting anecdotes, and so many observations and reflections, gay and grave, sportive and sentimental, (all expressed in a gay and familiar style,) better suited to the purpose than sentences laboured with artificial exactness, that we cannot but recommend it to our readers as a highly amusing and interesting performance.

<Q><P>The grounds of M. De Rulhiere's information seem indisputable, and his readers appear to have every reason to be satisfied with his discernment, in unfolding the motives and circumstances that concurred in bringing about this striking event. He is no servile copier, but has drawn his characters, and described his scenes, with the hand of a master.</P>
<P>We shall only add, that we have seldom met with more interesting original anecdotes, than those that are contained in the little work which we have now reviewed.</P>
