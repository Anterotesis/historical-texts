<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Spoken by Mr. LEWIS.</BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>THROUGH the wide tracts of life, in every trade,</L>
<L>What numbers toil with faculties decay'd?</L>
<L>Worn out, yet eager,— in the race they run,</L>
<L>And never learn—when proper to have done.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What need of proofs? Ev'n Authors do the same,</L>
<L>And rather than desist decline in fame.</L>
<L>Like Gamesters thrive at first; then bolder grow,</L>
<L>And hazard all upon one desp'rate throw.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>This truth to feel, perhaps too much inclin'd,</L>
<L>Our Bard, long hackney'd, trembles there behind,</L>
<L>Lest he should prove—another <HI>VANISH'D MIND.</HI></L>
<L>Long has this play lain hid, suppress'd by fears,</L>
<L>Beyond the critics rule, <HI>ABOVE NINE YEARS!</HI></L>
<L>And now he comes, 'tis the plain simple truth,</L>
<L>This night to answer for his sins of youth.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The piece, you'll say, should now perfection bear;</L>
<L>But who can reach it after all his care?</L>
<L>He paints no monsters for ill judg'd applause:</L>
<L>Life he has view'd, and from that source he draws.</L>
<L><PB REF="4"/>
Here are no fools, the Drama's standing jest!</L>
<L>And <HI>WELCHMEN</HI> now, <HI>NORTH-BRITONS</HI> too may rest.</L>
<L><HI>HIBERNIA'S SONS</HI> shall here excite no wonder,</L>
<L>Nor shall <HI>ST. PATRICK</HI> blush to hear them blunder.</L>
<L>By other arts he strives your taste to hit,</L>
<L>Some plot, some character; he hopes, some wit.</L>
<L>And if this piece should please you like the past;</L>
<L>Ye Brother Bards! forgive him:—'tis his last.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Lost are the friends who lent their aid before;</L>
<L><HI>ROSCIUS</HI> retires, and <HI>BARRY</HI> is no more.</L>
<L>Harmonious <HI>BARRY!</HI> with what varied art</L>
<L>His grief, rage, tenderness assail'd the heart?</L>
<L>Of plaintive <HI>OTWAY</HI> now no more the boast!</L>
<L>And <HI>SHAKESPEARE</HI> grieves for his <HI>OTHELLO</HI> lost.</L>
<L>Oft on this spot the tuneful swan expir'd,</L>
<L>Warbling his grief;—you listen'd and admir</L>
<L>'Twas then but fancy'd woe; now ev'ry Muse,</L>
<L>Her lyre unstrung, with tears his urn bedews.</L>

<STAGE><HI>Scene, the House of</HI> Sir JOHN MILLAMOUR.</STAGE>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> Sir JOHN, <HI>and</HI> BYGROVE.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BYGROVE.</SPEAKER>
<P>WHY then I'd marry again, and disinherit him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Brother Bygrove, you think too severely in these matters.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BYGROVE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Severely, Sir John? If I had a mind that my son should marry, why should he not do as I would have him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Allowance must be made for inclina∣tion. The success of our children depends upon the manner, in which we set them out in the world. They are like bowls which, if deliver'd out of hand with a due regard to their bias, our aim is answer'd, if otherwise, they are short or wide of the mark in view, or perhaps rush wildly out of the green.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BYGROVE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well argued, truly! he that should obey is to judge for himself, and you that are his go∣vernor, are to be directed by him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why he is chiefly interested in the end, and the choice of the means may be fairly left to him∣self. I can't but be tender of George; a plant of my own rearing, and the tree will hereafter be known by its fruit.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="2" REF="8"/>
<SPEAKER>BYG.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is a tree that will bear nothing without grafting; and if I could not inoculate what will make it thrive and flourish, it should not incumber a foot of my land.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your system and mine differ widely, Brother Bygrove. My son is of a large and liberal understanding, and I a father of mild authority.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BYG.</SPEAKER>
<P>Authority!—your son's word is a law to you. Now there is my young graceless; he is in the army, and why? Because I chose it. I had a mind he should serve; and so he went to be shot at. No arguing with me. If I see any thing wrong, I accost him directly: Look ye, Sir, do you think to go on in this fashion? Not during my life, I pro∣mise you: I will acknowledge you no longer than you prove worthy; and if you can't discern what is befitting you, I at least will judge what is proper on my part.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, George and I have lived together as friends. From a boy, I endeavoured to subject him rather to his reason, than his fears. If any little irregularity happened, he was no sooner sensible of it, than his cheek coloured, and the blush of youth not only looked decent, but expressed an ingenuous and well-disposed mind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BYG.</SPEAKER>
<P>But the consequence of all this? Has he a settled opinion? a fixed principle for a moment? He is grown up in caprice; his judgment has not vi∣gour to be decisive upon the merest trifle; he is de∣stracted by little things, and of course is perishing by little and little.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! no; all from a good cause; his knowledge of life occasions quick reflection: quick reflection shews things in a variety of lights. I am not angry. He will settle in the world; you will see him married before long.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BYG.</SPEAKER>
<P>In what a variety of lights his wife will ap∣pear to him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="3" REF="9"/>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I beg your pardon for a moment. I see person there. Charles, Charles, this way.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> CHARLES.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Charles, what is he about?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLES.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very busy, Sir, a thousand things in hand.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BYG.</SPEAKER>
<P>And all at the same time, I'll warrant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLES.</SPEAKER>
<P>We have a deal to employ us, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have you sounded him in regard to what I mentioned last night?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLES.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's what I wanted to tell your Ho∣nour. Last night, Sir, as he was going to bed, I touch'd upon the subject; dropt a hint or two, that it is now time to think of raising heirs to himself; en∣larged upon the comforts of matrimony, and I think with no small degree of eloquence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BYG.</SPEAKER>
<P>The fellow is laughing at you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, and how? What effect?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLES.</SPEAKER>
<P>A very visible effect, Sir. This morn∣ing early, my master rings his bell. Charles, says he, I have been considering what you said last night: I shall pay a visit to the young ladies, and, I believe, I shall marry one of them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>There, Mr. Bygrove; I am for ever ob∣liged to you, Charles. Well, go on.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLES.</SPEAKER>
<P>I fly immediately to get him his things to dress, and return in an instant. Charles, says he, then tossed himself back in his chair, beat the ground with his heel, and fell a reading. Won't your Honour get ready to visit the young ladies?—The ladies? what ladies, you blockhead?—Lady Bell, and Lady Jane, your Honour, Mrs. Bromley's handsome nieces. Po! you're a numskull, says he, with an oblique kind of a smile; stretched his arms, yawned, talked to himself, and bade me go about my business.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BYG.</SPEAKER>
<P>I knew it would end so. There is not a crane-neck carriage in town can give a short turn with
<PB N="4" REF="10"/>him. He will continue going on from one thing to another, and end in nothing at last.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is provoking. Any body with him this morning?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLES.</SPEAKER>
<P>He has had a power of people with him, Sir—A commission-broker, to sell him a com∣pany in a marching regiment; the Mayor of a bo∣rough, about a seat in parliament. And there are several with him now, Sir. There is Sir Harry Love∣wit, and—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BYG.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye! Sir Harry! I am glad he is of age, and that I am no longer his guardian. He has not had a new idea in his head since he was five years old, and yet the blockhead affects to be lively. He runs after wits, who do nothing but laugh at him. He repeats scraps and sentences; all memory and no understanding; a mere retailer of what falls from other people, and with that stock he sets up for a wit.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLES.</SPEAKER>
<P>He is with my master, Sir; and there is Mr. Malvil, and Mr. Dashwould, and—<HI>(bell rings)</HI> —He rings, Sir: you will pardon me; I must be gone, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Exit.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BYG.</SPEAKER>
<P>And that fellow, Dashwould; he is the ruin of your son, and of poor Sir Harry into the bargain. He is the Merry Andrew of the town: honour has no restraint upon him; truth he sets at nought, and friendship he is ever ready to sacrifice to a joke.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Po! mere innocent pleasantry. Dash∣would has no harm in him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BYG.</SPEAKER>
<P>No harm in him? I grant you the fellow has a quick sense of the ridiculous, and draws a charac∣ter with a lucky hit. But every thing is distorted by him. He has wit to ridicule you; invention to frame a story of you; humour to help it about, and when he has set the town a laughing, he puts on a familiar air, and shakes you by the hand.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><PB N="5" REF="11"/>
<HI>Enter</HI> Sir HARRY, <HI>laughing violently.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> HARRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! ho! ho! I shall certainly expire one day, in a fit of laughing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>What's the matter, Sir Harry?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BYG.</SPEAKER>
<P>What fool's errand brings him hither?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> HARRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>That fellow, Dashwould, will be the death of me. The very spirit of whim, wit, humour, and raillery possess him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BYG.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay! wit and humour for the meridian of your understanding.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> HARRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>By the shade of Rablais, he is the most entertaining creature! He has play'd off such a fire-work of wit. I'll tell you what he said this moment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BYG.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Sir, no; if you are a pedlar in smart sayings and brisk repartees, we don't desire you to unpack for us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> HARRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>A plague on him for an agreeable de∣vil! And then the rogue has so much ease.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BYG.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, the ease of an executioner. He puts all to death without remorse. He laughs at every thing, as if Heaven intended to make its own work ridicu∣lous. He has no relish for beauty, natural or moral. He is in love with deformity, and never better pleased, than when he has most reason to find fault.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> HARRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is a picture of as harsh features as any in Dashwould's whole collection.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BYG.</SPEAKER>
<P>But the picture is true. No exaggerationin it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> HARRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>He gave us a miniature of you, this morning, my dear guardian, and you shall have it. Dashwould has made a discovery, Sir John. What reason do you think he gives for Mr. Bygrove's rail∣ing for ever at your son's inconstancy of temper?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BYG.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, now! now!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> HARRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>You positively shall hear it. Mr. Bygrove's desires being all rusted to a point, looking directly toward the land of matrimony—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="6" REF="12"/>
<SPEAKER>BYG.</SPEAKER>
<P>Matrimony! now gild the pill with humour, and down it goes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> HARRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dashwould has found you out. Mr. Bygrove's desires being all collected and fixed on ma∣trimony, he rails at the variety of my friend Mila∣mour's whimsies, like Sir George Bumper, with chalkstones on his knuckles, as big as nutmegs, hobbling along and thanking <HI>Doctor Le Fevre</HI> that he has no small humours flying about him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's a discovery indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BYG.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir John, can you mind what such a fellow as Dashwould says? Every thing that passes through the medium of his fancy appears deformed, as the straitest stick looks crooked in troubled water.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> HARRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well dashed out, upon my soul, with tolerable spleen, and some vivacity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BYG.</SPEAKER>
<P>Po!—if you had taken my advice, Sir Harry and renounced his acquaintance long ago, you had been now a young man coming into life, with some promise of a character. Continue in dissipation, Sir. For my part it is a rule with me, neither to give nor take a joke.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> HARRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ho! ho! ho! a pleasant rule, posi∣tively —ho! ho! ho! Dashwould shall have it this moment; do you take the consequence; and in the mean time, I'll leave you to the practice of your so∣cial humour.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Exit.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BYG.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is such coxcombs as that butterfly, that encourage him to fix his pasquinades upon every man's character. Matrimony!—a licentious— No, Sir John, I still cherish the memory of your sis∣ter; she was the best of wives; 'sdeath, interrupted again by that—No, it's my friend Malvil; he is a man of true value.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dashwould says, he is a compound of false charity, and real malice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="7" REF="13"/>
<SPEAKER>BYG.</SPEAKER>
<P>And it is enough for you that Dashwould says it. Malvil is a man of honour, Sir; and an enemy to all scandal, though wit prove a palateable ingredient in the poison.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> MALVIL.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Intolerable! there is no being safe where he is. A licentious railer! All truth, all morality sacrificed to a jest: nothing sacred from his buf∣foonery.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BYG.</SPEAKER>
<P>I told you, Sir John, how it is.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! such indiscriminate satire!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BYG.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, the fellow runs a muck, and nothing escapes him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is no enduring it. Ridicule is a very unfair weapon, Mr. Bygrove: it is by no means the test of truth, Sir John.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, but you are too grave about this matter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Too grave! Shall he wantonly stab the re∣putation of his neighbour, and then tell you it was in jest? For my part, I had rather throw a veil over the infirmities of my friend, than seek a malicious pleasure in the detection. That's my way of think∣ing.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I fancy you are right. This son of mine does so perplex me.</P>
<STAGE>(walks aside.)</STAGE>

<P>Pray, Mr. Bygrove, give me leave. I am sorry to hear certain whispers about a friend of ours.</P>

<P>About whom? the widow, Mrs. Bromley?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! no, no; I have a great respect for her: though I—Pray don't you think she throws out the lure for a young husband?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BYG.</SPEAKER>
<P>For a husband, yes, but not too young a one; you can serve my interest in that quarter.</P>

<SPEAKER>BYG.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not a syllable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>So much the better: though it is fit you should be put upon your guard. Any money of yours in his hands?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BYG.</SPEAKER>
<P>Po! as safe as the bank.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>I may be mistaken. I hope I am: I was in company the other night; several members of par∣liament present; they did not speak plainly; hints and inuendos only; you won't let it go any further. His seat in the house they all agreed, is perfectly con∣venient at this juncture. I hope the cloud will blow over.—I shall remember you with the widow.</P>

<P>One good turn deserves another: I shan't be unmindful of your interest.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>MAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>There, now you hurt me: you know my delicacy: must friendship never act a disinterested part? I esteem you, Mr. Bygrove, and that's suffi∣cient. Sir John, give me leave to say, the man who busies himself about other people's affairs, is a prag∣matical character, and very dangerous in society.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BYG.</SPEAKER>
<P>So I have been telling Sir John. But to laugh at every thing is the fashion of the age. A pleasant good-for-nothing fellow is by most people preferred to modest merit. A man like Dashwould, who runs on—So! here come Scandal in folio.</P>

<P>They waged war a whole winter, for the ho∣nour of having the greatest number of fools thinking of nothing but the odd trick. First, Mrs. All-night kept Sundays; her Ladyship did the same: Mrs. All-night had forty tables; her Ladyship rose to fifty. Then one added, then t'other; 'till every room in the house was cramm'd like the black hole at Cal∣cutta; and at last, upon casting up the account, Sir Richard sold off fifteen hundred acres, to clear in∣cumbrances.</P>

<P>So they gave our. Sir Richard did not care a nine-pin for her while she was his. You know his way: he despises what is in his possession, and languishes for what is not. Her Ladyship was no sooner married to—what's his name?—His father was a footman, and Madam Fortune, who every now and then loves a joke, sent him to the East Indies, and in a few years brought him back at the head of half a million, for the jest's sake.</P>

<P>Gulliver's Travels is a true history to him. His son has strange flights. First he was to be a lawyer; bought chambers in the Temple, eat his commons, and was called to the bar. Then the law is a damn'd dry, municipal study; the army is fitter for a gentleman; and as he was going to the War∣office to take out his commission, he saw my Lord Chancellor's coach go by; in an instant, back to the Temple, and no sooner there, <Q>Po! pox! hang the law; better marry, and live like a gentleman.</Q> Now marriage is a galling yoke, and he does not know what he'll do. He calls his man Charles; sends him away; walks about the room; sits down; asks a question; thinks of something else; talks to himself, sings, whistles, lively, pensive, pleasant, and melancholy in an instant. He approves, sinds fault; he will, he will not; and in short, the man does not know his own mind for half a second.—Here comes Sir John.</P>

<P>Why I have thought much upon the subject of late, and with a certain refinement, I don't know but a man may fashion a complying girl to his taste of happiness. Virtuous himself, he confirms her in her virtue; constant, he secures her fidelity: and by continuing the lover, instead of commencing the ty∣rant husband, he wins from her the sweetest exertion of tenderness and love.

<P>Ha! ha! poor Beverley! I saw him, last summer, at Paris, dressed in the stile of an English fox-hunter: he swore there was not a morsel to eat in their country; kept an opera-singer upon beef-steaks and oyster-sauce; drove to his villa every Saturday in a phaeton, and returned on the Monday, like a young Buck, just come upon town.</P>

<SPEAKER><HI>Mrs.</HI> BROM.</SPEAKER>
<P>I made you a gentlewoman. Did not I take you up in the country, where you lived in the parsonage-house, you, and your sister, with no other company to converse with, than the me∣lancholy tomb-stones, where you read the high and mighty characters of John Hodge, and Deborah his wife? While your father's miserable horse, worn to a shadow with carrying double to the next market∣town, limped about, with a dull alms begging eye in quest of the wretched sustenance, that grew thriftily between the graves?

<P>Your virtue will reclaim him. I have a friendship for Millamour, and that is my reason for counteracting the designs of my friend Bygrove.—Mr. Bygrove has desired me to speak favourably of him to your ladyship.</P>

<P>Why, I can't say much for a country life: you are perfectly right. Rooks and crows about your house; fox-hounds in full cry all the morning; the country 'squires as noisy at dinner as their own hounds; disputes about the game; commissioners of turnpikes, justices of the peace, and pedigrees of horses; <Q>Oroonoko, brother to White Surry, got by Brisk Lightning, his dam by Bold Thun∣der.</Q> —That's the whole of their conversation.</P>

<P>He is a very worthy man. I am sorry to see some oddities in him; but that is very common in life. Vices always border upon virtues.

<P>I don't know as to that; but I can see what is working in his heart. He is above stairs now: I don't half like his choice: Lady Bell is the proper match for him, and her fortune is the best. An estate, you know, must come to her, by the fa∣mily settlement. You should direct his choice.</P>

<P>You have been very kind in that way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BYG.</SPEAKER>
<P>See what comes of your friend Millamour's being left to his own discretion. The ass in the fable, divided in his choice, and still doubting on, till it is too late to resolve, gives but a faint image of him</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Capt.</HI> BYG.</SPEAKER>
<P>And if I, Sir, to avoid his irreso∣lution—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BYG.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are in the opposite extreme: he thinks too much and never decides. You never think at
<PB N="27" REF="35"/>all, and so resolve without judgment. Take the advice of your friends before you come here to play the antic tricks of love; to kneel, cringe, fawn, flatter, and make yourself ridiculous. Do you know enough of the world to judge for yourself? Can you tell what they are all doing in the gay sphere of life? The young are all bred up under the veterans of vice and folly. The see their mothers with autumnal faces, playing the agreeable, and for∣geting that they are no longer young. The men are advanced beyond all former bounds, and the wo∣men press close aster them. A club for the ladies! intrepidity is now the female charm: to compleat their career, there is nothing left but to build a turf Coterie, at Newmarket, and ride their own matches, over the four mile course.</P>

<P>Dashwould! an indiscriminate railer! I speak for your good, and remember, I tell you, you know nothing of the world. After all, Sir; Lady Bell is the person I wish to see you married to:—go, and pay your addresses to her. I will set∣tle that matter for you: you may then marry the person, to whom you have not degraded yourself, by pining, sighing, love vetses, and I know not what.</P>

<P>Very true; and besides, though I am not inclined, with the malicious part of the world, to suspect her virtue, yet this town has temptations. It grieves me to see the ways of this great city; fine women without principle; friends without sincerity: marriages to day, divorces to-morrow; whole estates set upon the cast of a die; masquerades without wit or humour; new comedies that make you cry, and tragedies that put you to sleep: It grieves me to see all this.

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> NEV.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tyrannical woman! some virtues she has; but they are overshadowed by their opposite qualities. Her love of praise, is a gross appetite
<PB N="29" REF="37"/>of flattery. She oppresses with kindness, and her very civilities are sure to be disobliging. Oh! state of dependance! for mere support, to be subject every hour to caprice and arrogance!—Is it pride that makes me feel with this sensibillity?—No, my heart can answer it is not. I can bow to the hand that relives me; but I cannot stoop to the servile office of pampering vanity and ostentation, with low and fulsome flattery. What does Lady Bell mean by talking to me of Sir Harry? She does it—I know her goodness—she does it to soften affliction, and, if possible, divert a mind depressed with sorrow. Sir Harry never threw away a thought on me. He behaves, indeed, with marked civility; but I don't know what to think of him. I must not aspire too high: no, I have no pretensions.</P>

<P>Not in the least. A natural charac∣ter. One would not, to be sure, tell a hideous man that one loves him: but when one has encouraged him by degrees, and drawn him on, like a new glove, and perhaps done him a mischief in the doing it, why then one would draw him off again, and may be ask a pretty fellow to help a body; and then the wretch looks so piteous, and kneels at your feet, then rises in a jealous fit. <Q>I take my everlasting farewell; never to return; no, never; what to her? who en∣couraged me? encouraged him? who promised? broke her promise? The treacherous, faithless, dear deluding</Q>—then returns in an instant; hands dangling; eyes imploring; tongue faultering; <Q>La∣dy Bell, —Lady Bell—when you know that I adore you</Q>—And I burst into a fit of laughter in his face: Oh! that's my joy, my triumph, my supreme delight.</P>

<P>The old story; Mrs. Bromley's eternal whims.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>MAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your delicacy charms me: It has fixed me yours. I long for nothing so much, as to see you out of her power. They have a strange report about town: people will be talking: the whisper goes that Mr. Bygrove, amidst all his grief, is slily in a hurry for another wife.

<SP>
<SPEAKER>MAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>I dare say not: I don't think they are too forward. I am sorry to see, in one of the papers to-day, a character of Sir Harry, not at all favour∣able. His little follies, his whims, and caprices one does not mind: He may walk in Dashwould's train as long as he pleases; that only makes him ridiculous. But it grieves me to hear that perfidy stains his character, and, as I am told, the worst of perfidy: the ruin of beauty and innocence is his ruling passion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> NEV.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is very odd: somebody has been at the trouble of sending me an anonymous letter to that very effect: and why to me? I am not able to decypher.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't like anonymous letters. In general they aim at mischief, but this perhaps, is meant as a caution to you: it must be a friend that sent it.</P>

<P>I don't say that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nor I; I never-charge any body; but upon recollection, the letter in the news-paper is imputed to him. Mrs. Bromley, I know, has no opinion of Sir Harry. His designs, with regard to you, she does not think honourable. My heart in∣terests me for you. You know I am all heart. The plan which Mrs. Bromley has proposed—Hark! I think I hear Millamour coming. I'll follow you up stairs.</P>

<P>She loves Sir Harry, I see; and yet she shan't slip thro' my hands. I can set on Mrs. Brom∣ley
<PB N="37" REF="45"/>to lead her a weary life, and if I can prevail upon Millamour to renounce Lady Bell, and marry the widow, my business is done. When Miss Ne∣ville is heartily tormented by Mrs. Bromley, afflic∣tion softens the mind, and I may then decoy her away, and stand upon terms with the family. But Dashwould's wit will fly about. No matter: he is a sad scoundrel, and does not mind how he murders reputations. So! here comes Millamour. I must get clear of him, and talk further with Miss Neville.</P>

<P>It would be sport, but I despair of it. You know, Mr. Dashwould, you allow that Millamour has understanding.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DASH.</SPEAKER>
<P>But he does not act from his understand∣ing. Fits and starts of passion govern him. If in any one pursuit of real use, he had half the alacrity of mind, with which he runs on, from one folly to another, he would be a man for the ladies to pull caps for. But he lives for ever in inconsistencies. One action of his life is the sure forerunner of the contrary. First Malvil is his favourite! then arm in arm with me: Can any two things be more op∣posite? It is the same among the ladies! they all have him by turns, and the whim of one moment, is sure to find a ridiculous antithesis in the next.</P>

<P>Bravo! you seem in prodigious spirits.</P>

<P>I am so: I am happy in myself, and happy in my friends, and happy in every circumstance, and in tip-top spirits, and—my dear Malvil, your's down to the ground.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Methinks I sympathize with you. When our friends are happy, the sensation is well called a fellow feeling.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Malvil, I thank you: your turn of mind is formed for lasting friendships. With Dashwould it is all dissipation, and giddy mirth, the mere bub∣ble of pleasure. To you, I may talk seriously, The topic of the day is enough for Dashwould. I can now tell you, that I shall be happy for life. But
<PB N="45" REF="53"/>for Dashwould, I should have been settled long ago. That fellow has led me into a thousand errors.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>He has his admirers, and not without rea∣son. He thinks me his enemy, but he is mistaken. I never harbour resentment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are growing grave, and I am a flight above common sense at present.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dashwould, notwithstanding all his faults, does hit the mark sometimes. I don't usually laugh at his pleasantry; I don't like to encourage him too much; but it must be owned, he is often right. Be∣hind his back I cannot help being diverted by him. He has a quick insight into characters.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>No want of penetration there.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no; he says, and perhaps rightly, your lively ladies often want common prudence; and giddy in the pursuit of pleasure, they are frequently miserable in the end.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>But Lady Bell's good sense, that refinement of understanding—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>There are false refinements; the shadow for the substance. Who is it that observes, we all discover early symptoms of the disease, by which our minds and bodies go to ruin?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Po! with Lady Bell there can be no risk.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't know whether Dashwould is good authority.—You know him best. He says—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>He is a shrewd observer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nobody more so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>If he has a regard for any body, it is for you. You are the only man I never heard him speak ill of. A match with Lady Bell is not to his mind. He talk'd seriously on the subject. Has not he told you?</P>

<SPEAKER>MAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wonder at that. Lady Bell, he says, shew'd herself early. Impatient of advice, atten∣tive to nothing but her beauty! whole days at her looking glass—I repeat his very words—he seemed to speak out of downright regard for you.—At her toilette every feature had its instructions how to look; but no instruction for the mind. And then, says he, that terrible love of gaming!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Gaming!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't you know it? I can't say I ever saw it myself. Time will determine her character.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>If she loves gaming, it is pretty well deter∣mined already.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps not: I still hope for the best.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why yes; a man of sense may form her mind, and then the gentler affections may take their turn.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>The very thing I said.—But our pleasant friend had an answer ready—Gentle affections, says he! don't you see that it is with people that once love play, as with persons addicted to strong cordials? they never return to cooler liquors.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thereis some truth in that. I am for ever obliged to you. It is ingenuous, it is friendly in you to convey the hint.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't build too much upon it. I have told you my author; and you know his way: he may deny it all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Shall I talk to him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't know what to say to that. In his vein of pleasantry, he may give it another turn.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>He may so. I am glad to know all this. But my Lady Jane, there's a model for her sex to imitate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have you watch'd her well? People should appear what they really are. Let a precipice look like a precipice. When covered over with flowers,
<PB N="47" REF="57"/>it only serves to deceive the unwary. Mrs. Bromley has been very communicative about Lady Jane.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>You alarm me. My dear friend explain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>To do Lady Bell justice, she is above dis∣guise. And though she has her faults, I have seen her please by those very faults.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MIL. </SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(smiling.)</STAGE>
<P>And so have I. Her very blemishes are beauty spots.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>No frankness about the youngest girl. It is friendship for you that makes me speak. Her character is all forced, studied, put on with her rouge.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Does she paint?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>A little; the prudent touch. I am sorry for her. When she is settled in the world, many qualities, which now lie concealed, will break out into open day-light.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>What a masked battery there will be to play off upon her husband!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Their aunt told me all in confidence. You may judge how painful it is to her. I have known the family for some time. I can't but be sorry for the young ladies.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>And since this is the case, I don't care how little I know of them, or their family.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>No occasion to quarrel with the family. Great merit about Mrs. Bromley. She made an ad∣mirable wife, and that at an early period. She was but seventeen when she married.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>No more?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Not an hour: she is not thirty: an estate in her own right, and the command of half a borough. No opposition there; the old houses have the votes. A man may get a seat without trouble. Does not Sir John want to see you in parliament?</P>

<P>Let me tell you, Sir, with all your flashes of wit, you will find that you have been playing with an edge-tool at last. And what does this mighty witamount
<PB N="54" REF="64"/>to? The wit in vogue, exposes one man; makes another expose himself; gets into the secrets of an intimate acquaintance, and publishes a story to the world; belies a friend; puts an anecdote, a letter, an epigram into the news-paper; and that is the whole amount of modern wit.</P>

<P>Well, Sir, we'll adjourn the debate. You may go on; mis∣represent every thing; if there is nothing ridiculous, invent a story: and when you have done it, it is but a cheap and a frivolous talent. Has a lady a good natural bloom? Her paint must be an expensive ar∣ticle. Does she look grave? She will sin the deeper. Is she gay and affable? Her true character will come out at the Commons. That is the whole of your art, and I leave you to the practice of it.</P>

Here is a lady in question, untainted by the fashions of the age. Make her your own. She has no fortune; what then? Shew yourself superior to the sordid views, that govern the little mercenary spirits of the world.</P>

<P>I have just recollected what you said of Jack Invoice, upon his marriage.</P>

<SPEAKER>DASH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Jack Invoice! He never was intended for any thing but to be laughed at. Upon the death of a rich uncle in the city, he comes to the west end of the town, with a plumb in his pocket, and not an idea in his head; marries a fantastical woman of rank, and with a sovereign contempt of all his former ac∣quaintance, mixes with lords and people of quality,
<PB N="64" REF="74"/>who win his money, and throw his wig in the fire to divert themselves. He laughs at their wit, and thinks himself in good company.</P>

I have thought much of your situation: our time is short; they will be all rising from table, presently. Attend to what I say: since Mrs. Bromley is so incessant in her tyranny, do as I already hinted to you. Withdraw from this house at once. Madam la Rouge has an apartment ready for you. You may there remain concealed. In the mean time I shall be at work for you. I shall prevail upon Mrs. Bromley to keep her word, about the five thousand pounds.

<SP>
<SPEAKER>MIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is rather too much, Sir. If I have, in a few instances, departed from a resolution that seemed fixed, you know very well, it is not uncom∣mon; and when a person means an extraordinary leap, he retires back, to take advantage of the ground, and spring forward with greater vigour.</P>

<P>How so? Because you chang'd your mind? There is nothing more natural. Don't you see men doing the same thing every day? Down goes the old mansion; a new one rises; exotic trees smile on the landscape, and enjoy the northern air; and when the whole is finished, in less than a twelve-month, the auctioneer mounts his pulpit. "Pleasing contiguity" —"Beautiful, and picturesque scene"—"Delect∣ably featured by Nature"—"Shall I say twenty thousand?—Down it goes to the highest bidder, who pays his money, and runs away the next morning with an opera singer to Italy.</P>

<P>They do not warrant improper liber∣ties. I can be humble as becomes my situation. I hope you will not oblige me to shew that spirit, which virtue is as much intitled to, as the proudest fortune in the kingdom.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> HAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>I mean you no disrespect. That letter is a black artifice to traduce my character: the fraud shall be brought to light; you may rely upon it; nor will you be so ungenerous as to believe the dark assassin of my honour.</P>

<P>That he treated with wanton pleasantry what I thought a serious matter. I may mistake the means, but the end of my actions I can always an∣swer for. Sir John might hear of the affair from another quarter, and so to soften his resentment—</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know you have the grimace of character. Mr. Malvil, arm'd at all points with plausible maxims. But which of your maxims can justify the treachery of betraying the secret of a friend? Who does it, is a destoryer of all confidence; and when he attempts to varnish his conduct, with the specious name of friendship, the malignity strikes the deeper: artful, smiling malignity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>I deserve all this. Friendship in excess is a fault. There are bounds and limits even to virtue. It would be well if a man could always hit the exact point. There is however something voluptuous in meaning well.</P>

<P>Morals are not eapable of mathematical de∣monstration. And—now I recollect myself—It did not occur at first—It was Madam La Rouge told the affair to Sir John.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DASH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! fie, don't be too severe upon her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>She said at the same time—you know her manner—she told Sir John that you are in love with half a dozen, and will deceive them all, and Lady Bell into the bargain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Distraction! she dare not say it. This is another of your subterfuges. You know, Sir, how you traduced Lady Bell, and made that gentleman the author of your own malevolence. At any other time and place, this sword should read you a lecture of morality.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>You, Sir, deserve something worse than ri∣dicule. You are thoroughly understood. Your tenderness for your neighbour, is malignant curio∣sity; your half hints, that hesitate slander, speak the louder; and your silence, that affects to suppress what you know, is a mute, that strangles.</P>

<SPEAKER>MAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>The probity of my character, Sir—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DASH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, probity is the word. He has had pretty perquisites from his probity; legacies, trust money, and the confidence of families. For aught I see, probity is as good a trade as any a going.</P>

<P>Mrs. Bromley! you will judge with candour.</P>

<P>Oh! Sir, it is all too plain.</P>

<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> Lady BELL, Miss NEVILLS, Sir HARRY, <HI>and</HI> Lady JANE.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lady</HI> BELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Here, Sir Harry, in the presence of this company, I give you, in this friend of mine,
<PB N="97" REF="107"/>truth, good sense, and virtue. Take her, Sir, and now you have got a treasure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> HAR. </SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(to Miss Neville)</STAGE>
<P>It shall be my pride to raise you to that sphere of life, which your merit, and your sufferings from—</P>
<STAGE>(looks at Mrs. Bromley)</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mrs.</HI> BROM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why fix on me, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> HAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>They are much mistaken, who can find no way of shewing their superior rank, but by letting their weight fall on those, whom fortune has placed beneath them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DASH.</SPEAKER>
<P>And that sentiment, however I may rattle, I wish impressed upon all the patrons of poor rela∣tions, throughout his Majesty's dominions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> NEV.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mrs. Bromley, I have much to say to you. My obligations to you I shall never forget. I am not ashamed, even in the presence of Sir Harry, to own the distress in which you found me. If at any time I have given offence; if under your displeasure, I have been impatient, you will allow for an educa∣tion that raised me much above my circumstances. That education shall teach me to act as becomes Sir Harry's Lady, with affection, with duty to him; and to you, madam, with gratitude, for that bounty which saved me from calamity and ruin.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mrs.</HI> BROM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your words overpower me. I feel that I have done wrong. I now see, that to demand in return, for favours conferred, an abject spirit, and mean compliance, is the worst usury society knows of. I rejoice at your good fortune: your merit de∣serves it.</P>
<STAGE>(they embrace)</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DASH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why this is as it should be.—Mr. Bygrove, I hope soon to wish you joy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BYG.</SPEAKER>
<P>Compared to Malvil, thou art an honest fellow, and I thank you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DASH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Millamour, is there no recompence for your virtue? in a modern comedy, you would be re∣warded with a wife.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="98" REF="108"/>
<SPEAKER>MIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lady Bell has more than poetical justice in her power. I wish Sir John were here: he would now see me reclaimed from every folly, by that lady.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mrs.</HI> BROM.</SPEAKER>
<P>If it is so, I congratulate you both.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lady</HI> BELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is even so, aunt; the whim of the present moment. Mr. Millamour has served my amiable friend, and I have promised him my hand— and so— <STAGE>(holds up both hands)</STAGE> which will you have? Puzzle about it, and know your own mind if you can.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>With rapture thus I snatch it to my heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lady</HI> BELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sister, what nunnery will you go to? Mr. Bygrove, command your son to take her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Capt.</HI> BYG.</SPEAKER>
<P>That command I have obeyed already.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lady</HI> JANE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Since the truth must out; we made use of a stratagem to fix my sister, and that gentleman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lady</HI> BELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>To fix yourself, if you please I knew you would be married before me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dashwould, give me your hand. Your wit shall enliven our social hours, and while I laugh with you at the events of life, you shall see me endeavour to weed out of my own mind every folly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DASH.</SPEAKER>
<P>You do me honour, Sir. And, if Mr. Bygrove will now and then give and take a joke—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BYG.</SPEAKER>
<P>As often as you please:—but take my advice, and don't lose your friend for your joke.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DASH.</SPEAKER>
<P>By no means, Mr. Bygrove, —except now and then, when the friend is the worst of the two.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, gentlemen, your differences are all at an end. Lady Bell, the varieties of life, till now, distracted my attention.</P>
</SP>
<L>But when our hearts victorious beauty draws,</L>
<L>We feel its pow'r, and own its sovereign laws;</L>
<L>To that subservient all our passions move,</L>
<L>And even my constancy shall spring from love.</L>

<BYLINE>Written by Mr. GARRICK. Spoken by Mrs. MATTOCKS.</BYLINE>
<SP>
<LG>
<L>IF after Tragedy 'tis made a rule,</L>
<L>To jest no more, I'll be no titt'ring fool,</L>
<L>To jog you with a joke in Tragic doze,</L>
<L>And shake the dew-drops from the weeping rose,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Prudes of each sex affirm, and who denies?</L>
<L>That in each tear a whimp'ring Cupid lies.</L>
<L>To such wise, formal folk, my answer's simple;</L>
<L>A thousand Cupids revel in a dimple!</L>
<L>From their soft nests, with laughter out they rush,</L>
<L>Perch'd on your heads, like small birds in a bush.</L>
<L>Beauty resistlefs in each smile appears:</L>
<L>Are you for dimples, ladies, or for tears?</L>
<L>Dare they in Comedy our mirth abridge?</L>
<L>Let us stand up for giggling privilege;</L>
<L>Assert our rights, that laughter is no sin,</L>
<L>From the <HI>screw'd simper,</HI> to the <HI>broad-fac'd grin.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So much for self; now turn we to the Poet:</L>
<L><HI>"KNOW YOUR OWN MIND"</HI>—Are any here who know it?</L>
<L>To know one's mind is a hard task indeed,</L>
<L>And harder still for us, by all agreed.</L>
<L>Cards, balls, beaux, feathers, round the eddy whirling,</L>
<L>Change every moment, while the hair is curling.</L>
<L>The Greeks say—<HI>"Know Thyself"</HI>—I'm sure I find,</L>
<L><HI>I Know Myself</HI> that I don't <HI>Know my Mind.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Know <HI>YOU</HI> your minds, wise Men?—Come, let us try.</L>
<L>I have a worthy cit there in my eye;</L>
<STAGE>(looking up)</STAGE>
<L>Tho' he to sneer at us takes much delight,</L>
<L>He cannot fix where he shall go to-night:</L>
<L>His pleasure and his peace are now at strife,</L>
<L>He loves his bottle, and he fears his wife.</L>
<L><PB REF="110"/>
He'll quit this house, not knowing what to do;</L>
<L>The <HI>Ska<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>espeare's Head</HI> first gives a pull or two</L>
<L>But with a sideling struggle he gets thro';</L>
<L>Darts across Russel-street: then with new charms,</L>
<L>The Syren, Luxury, his bosom warms,</L>
<L>And draws him in the vortex of the Bedford Arms.</L>
<L>Happy this night!—But when comes wife and sorrow?</L>
<L><HI>"To morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow."</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I see some laughers here; pray which of you</L>
<L>Know your own Minds?—in all this house but few!</L>
<L><HI>Wits</HI> never know their Minds;—our <HI>Minor Bards,</HI></L>
<L>Changing from bad to worse, now spin <HI>Charades.</HI></L>
<L>O'er <HI>Law</HI> and <HI>Physic</HI> we will draw a curtain;</L>
<L>There nothing but uncertainty is certain.</L>
<L>Grave looks, wigs, coats, —the Doctors now relingquish'em,</L>
<L>They're right—from <HI>Undertakers</HI> to distinguish'em.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The <HI>Courtiers,</HI> do' em justice, never doubt,</L>
<L>Whether' tis better to be <HI>in</HI> or <HI>out.</HI></L>
<L>Some <HI>Patriots</HI> too, know their own mind and plan;</L>
<L>They're firmly fix'd, to get <HI>in</HI> when they can;</L>
<L><HI>Gamesters</HI> don't waver; they all <HI>hazards</HI> run,</L>
<L>For some must cheat, and more must be undone.</L>
<L><HI>Great Statesmen</HI> know-their minds, but ne'er reveal'om;</L>
<L>We never know <HI>their</HI>secrets, 'till we feel them.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Grant me a favour, Critics: don't say nay;</L>
<L>Be of <HI>one mind</HI> with me, and like this Play.</L>
<L>Thence will two wonders rise: Wits will be kind,</L>
<L>Noy more—behold, a Woman <HI>Knows her Mind!</HI></L>
