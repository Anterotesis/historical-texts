<L>The midnight damps that drop from weeping yews,</L>
<L>Beneath th' eclipsed moon, (the scriech-owl's haunt)</L>
<L>Drenching the locks of some night-watching pil∣grim</L>
<L>Who sits, in dismal meditation wrapt,</L>
<L>And brainsick horror, o'er yon mould'ring grave,</L>
<L>By time defac'd, and frequent footsteps worn:</L>
<L>No mark remaining, but th' erected stone</L>
<L>Inscrib'd with narratives uncouth of birth,</L>

<L>And puzzling scans th' imperfect characters</L>

<L>Here, moping superstition nightly broods;</L>
<L>Here counts the clarion of the bird of dawn,</L>
<L>Whose dreary note proclaims the ebbing night,</L>
<L>And drives the frighted goblin to his haunt,</L>
<L>The time-recording cock: or to the winds</L>

<L>The winds, that mournful yell, from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> vaults,</L>
<L>And broken sepulchres, their groaning access;</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="4"/>As if they wail'd the long-departing dead,</L>

<L>Her pencil, still in dark delusive tincts,</L>
<L>And paints the face of things; detested growpe!</L>
<L>A landskip fit for hell: the work of fiends!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Let rescu'd fancy turn aloft her eye,</L>
<L>And view yon wide extended arch; behold</L>
<L>Yon crystal concave, studded with the gems,</L>
<L>The radiant gems of heav'n, that nightly burn</L>
<L>In golden lamps, and gild th' aetherial space;</L>
<L>That smiling vault, that canopy of stars,</L>
<L>Those cluster'd constellations! mark yon moon</L>
<L>Serenely shine; (her borrow'd lustre full;)</L>
<L>The mountain tops, the rocks, the vales, the lawns,</L>
<L>By her set off, adorn'd, and made delightful:</L>
<L>The boundless main, a polish'd mirror now,</L>
<L>Reflecting, from its bosom, back, the vast,</L>
<L>The wonderful, the glorious, glad appearance!</L>
<L>Bright visions eccho to th' inchanted eye;</L>
<L>As, on the ear, harmonious sounds return</L>

<L><PB N="6" REF="5"/>All these, with universal praise, proclaim</L>
<L>Their great creator; bountiful, benign,</L>

<L>Behold, yon blazing sun! but, Oh, to what;</L>
<L>To what shall we compare; (away with such</L>
<L>A thought) to what resemble him! this globe;</L>
<L>Ten thousand thousand worlds, beyond where space</L>
<L>Exists, where matter lives; beyond the grasp</L>
<L>Of human thought, imagination's ken,</L>
<L>Nay reason's reach, the intellect of angels?—</L>
<L>But, silence best becomes the boundless theme;</L>
<L>In wonder swallow'd up, and deep astonishment!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What should we fear? this glorious prospect brings</L>
<L>No dreadful phantom to the frighted eye,</L>
<L>No terror to the soul; 'tis transport all!</L>
<L>Here fancy roves, in sweet variety</L>
<L>For ever lost; her native bliss. For her,</L>
<L>The blue ethereal arch expands; her table</L>
<L>Spread out with all the dainties of the sky,</L>
<L>Imagination's rich regale. For her</L>
<L>The clouds absorb the ev'ning ray; and drink</L>
<L>The liquid gold, which stains their fleecy sides</L>
<L>With all the tincts of heav'n, transmitted through</L>
<L>A thousand diff'rent strainers to the eye,</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="6"/>And thence upon the ravish'd soul diffus'd.</L>
<L>The blushing beauties of the infant morn,</L>
<L>Aurora's saffron beam; the splendid bow,</L>

<L>An emblem form'd of half eternity,</L>
<L>By angels robe'd in all the aggregate,</L>
<L>Th' unblended aggregate, of various day,</L>
<L>Of heav'n's own day; and from its sun-beams drawn,</L>
<L>In all its tinges dipt, its glories dress'd.</L>
<L>For her, the smiling earth puts on her mantle;</L>
<L>Her mantle green, with purple mix'd, with gold,</L>
<L>With all the liv'ries of the youthful spring,</L>
<L>To wake new raptures in the heart of man;</L>
<L>And fill his soul with gratitude immense.</L>
<L>All these are reason's treasures, stores of thought;</L>
<L>Reflection's unexhausted funds, replete</L>
<L>With matter for her own delightful task.</L>
<L>Here wisdom works at large; here smiling builds,</L>
<L>For sweet content, a homely shed; where joy,</L>
<L>Where gladness, visit oft her temp'rate guests,</L>
<L>And make their willing stay: here, undisturb'd,</L>
<L>They reign, they revel, take their fill of all</L>
<L>That nature (ever bounteous mother) yields,</L>
<L>For use or pleasure: but excess avoid;</L>
<L>That fiend accurs'd, whose bloated visage wan,</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="7"/>And troubled eye, betray her inward pang,</L>
<L>Which shakes severe her paralytic nerve,</L>
<L>Her tott'ring frame; e'er death, by nature taught,</L>
<L>And time, in season due, with gentle hand</L>
<L>Can cut the wasted thread: excess usurps</L>
<L>With force th' abortive task, and vindicates</L>
<L>Her prey—Come all, ye family of joy;</L>
<L>Ye children of the chearful hour, begot</L>
<L>By wisdom on the virtuous mind; O, come!</L>
<L>Come innocence, in conscious strength secure;</L>
<L>Come courage, foremost in the manly train;</L>

<L>O, come; indignant, drive out, far beyond</L>
<L>The utmost precincts of the human breast,</L>
<L>Beyond the springs of hope, the cells of joy,</L>
<L>And ev'ry mansion where a virtue lives;</L>
<L>O drive far off, for ever drive that bane,</L>
<L>That hideous pest, engender'd deep in hell,</L>
<L>Where Stygian glooms condens'd dimension'd darkness,</L>

<L>Horrid to sight, and by the frighted furies</L>
<L>In their dread pannic SUPERSTITION nam'd!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The close contracted span of human life</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="8"/>Is dearly purchas'd by the sons of care;</L>
<L>Since sickness, disappointment, pain, and death,</L>
<L>A thousand vary'd unavoided evils,</L>

<L>Like officers of wrath, let loose by pride,</L>
<L>To raise the rigid tax on wretched being;</L>
<L>A dreadful int'rest, for a sum so small!</L>
<L>Enough are these, alas, to gall and sting!</L>
<L>What need we then for fancy'd evils seek,</L>
<L>To scare the soul, and harrow up the heart,</L>
<L>Already toss'd, and torn, and broken down</L>
<L>By evils of its own contrivance? evils</L>
<L>Still adverse found, to nature's wholsome ways;</L>
<L>The bane of ev'ry bliss, and social joy:</L>
<L>Ambition, with her train; and luxury,</L>
<L>With custom link'd, with fell corruption join'd,</L>
<L>Led up by fashion in her frantic dance,</L>
<L>Follow'd by misery, despair, and death.</L>
<L>For pity's sake, forbear to haunt the world</L>
<L>With hideous spectres, and fantastic forms;</L>
<L>With harpy footed furies, fearful phantoms,</L>
<L>Everlasting torments, and unquenched fire.</L>

<L>What's a church-yard, what I pray? this horri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> goblin</L>
<L>Array'd in midnight weeds by frantic fancy</L>

<L>Was it the clock that told the passing; hour,</L>
<L>And told it too at midnight? when deep silence</L>
<L>And hideous darkness reign o'er half the world</L>
<L>It was.—What then? it tells it too at noon,</L>
<L>Amidst the noise and sunshine of that hour,</L>
<L>The clock that calls to business or to pleasure</L>
<L>The sons of avarice and sensual joy.</L>
<L>What tragic bustle when an engine strikes!</L>
<L>Shall meer negations, unsubstantial shades,</L>
<L>Such monsters form, to fright th' unthinking crowd</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="10"/>To fancy tangible, to terror real?</L>
<L>Let monks, let nurses put these vizors on,</L>
<L>To startle bigots, and astonish babes;</L>
<L>Reason scorns, and common sense defies 'em;</L>
<L>And who so weak to shudder at the sound</L>
<L>Of yon departed moment fled for ever!</L>
<L>Or with his sad foreboding sighs keep time</L>
<L>To each elapsing sand that silent flows</L>
<L>From his exhausting glass with breaking heart:</L>
<L>"O wretched avarice of breath, to draw</L>
<L>"Fresh air, or gaze upon the wearied sun;</L>
<L>To tread the same unvary'd round with pain,</L>
<L>To eat, to drink, to sleep, to satisfy</L>
<L>Each sensual sordid appetite, alas!</L>
<L>How oft have distant prospects, verdant views,</L>

<L>To sanguine pride presents and vain self-love,</L>
<L>How oft has cheated hope complain'd, and sought</L>
<L><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or refuge in despair? the sense itself</L>
<L>Grows weary of the toil, the beastly toil,</L>

<L>The creature of the mind, no more: the vassal</L>
<L>Of thought, whose very being is the soul</L>
<L>Made short or long, as that is more or less</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="11"/>Employ'd.—Good heav'n and earth, what horrid noise!</L>
<L>What stir about a reptile's poor concerns!</L>
<L>And when a worm expires, shall nature, say</L>
<L>Shall suffering nature sympathize with me?</L>
<L>Re-eccho groan for groan? so pride asserts;</L>
<L>O, monstrous pride! made drunk by fancy at</L>
<L>Ambition's feast. Shall yonder sun be hid,</L>
<L>Fierce <HI>Aetna</HI> flame, and thunder shake the poles,</L>
<L>Because, forsooth, some spring eccentric moves</L>
<L>Within this frail machine? and passion sways</L>
<L>The soul, for this the universal flood</L>
<L>Broke loose beyond its stated bounds; for this!</L>
<L>The mountains melt, the comets glare; for this!</L>
<L>Shall famine, pestilence, and war devour?</L>
<L>But, hark! th' infernal forge begins to roar,</L>
<L>The sounds of sorrow, and the yells of pain,</L>
<L>Now tear the shop of death, and reach my sense:</L>
<L>The flames ascend, the furies howl, and all</L>
<L>The Stygian eccho's ring a peal; a peal so loud,</L>
<L>That shakes the north of hell, and makes the throne</L>
<L>Of terror start. O whence this fierce uproar!</L>
<L>This strong convulsion in the realms of woe!</L>
<L>Behold yon reptile gasping in the arms,</L>
<L>Th' inexorable arms of death; how pale!</L>
<L>How ghastly are its looks! Ah! see, how fear,</L>

<L>What horrors! O, what anguish, must she taste,</L>
<L>Whilst yet her faculties are left entire;</L>
<L>Whilst yet, she views the gaping fiends and flames!</L>
<L>O say, can human thought, can words express,</L>
<L>What nature feels in that tremenduous hour?</L>
<L>What pangs, what spasms, twisting too and fro</L>
<L>With irritated force, convulsive, tug</L>
<L>The rooted fibres, and the springs of life!</L>
<L>By horrors heighten'd, and distemper'd fumes,</L>
<L>That rack the mind, and tear the tortur'd frame;</L>
<L>Till the crack'd heart, subdu'd at length, forgets</L>
<L>To pant; and death, in mercy, ends the fray:</L>
