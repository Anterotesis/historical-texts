<SPEAKER>Rachel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ten years! You constant soul!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Adelaide.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was scarce fifteen: his fortune was doubtful; my father forbid our intercourse—my Nugent was seized by ruffians (I could never find the cause), and carried up to Paris; but have since been assured, by my father, of his death.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rachel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lord! had I known, I should not have revived a painful idea.—Come, I must keep up your spirits. My father won't be home all night, and I've sent for my dear Jack Connor, to sup with us. Come, now, I wish I dare be angry with my father, for joining this sharping Count against his own master, Lord Esmond: no won∣der, for his mother, the old lady, not to rest in her grave. Adelaide, as sure as I live, I heard the ghost sing last night in the Belvedere room—the sweetest voice!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Adelaide.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very strange! I've now sat up pur∣posely three nights, but I've neither seen nor heard this wonder.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rachel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, but my dear, the poor dead lady is certainly disturb'd by the misfortunes of her son, Lord Esmond:—it must be she, for the ap∣parition is dress'd exactly like her picture that hangs in the room where it walks.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Adelaide.</SPEAKER>
<P>All fancy.—Ah! if the dead were suffer'd to revisit us, I should be comforted by my Nugent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="6" REF="9"/>

<P>Come, we must have no more thoughts of dead lovers:—you shall hear my living lover rattle, court, and sing at our little party; we'll be so jolly.—Come along.</P>

<P>Very well; take the horses back to the inn. Well, Trap, I've been your pri∣soner ten years, and your suffering me to come here from Paris is a stretch of good nature.—Yonder's my house: here am I in the centre of my own estate, and, thanks to fortune, not master of one foot of land.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mary.</SPEAKER>
<P>La, Miss, as sure as I live, there's a door none of us ever saw from your chamber to the haunted room. I went through a long passage that goes all the way; and there's my old lady's clothes-press open'd, and all in such a confusion!</P>

<P>Gone, Ma'am, but Lord knows where.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Adel.</SPEAKER>
<P>It must have been my Nugent; every circumstance confirms it; and this ghost must have been I that walk'd in my sleep. I shudder to think of the dangers I've escap'd; but my Nugent lives, and danger vanishes.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Adel.</SPEAKER>
<P>And does Mr. Nugent come here an impostor? Lord Esmond has been already too much wrong'd—deprived of liberty and for∣tune: and, though I never saw him, and once dearly loved you <STAGE>(<HI>to Ld.</HI> Esmond)</STAGE>, could I suppose you one of his unprincipled oppressors, I'd banish you for ever from my heart.</P>
</SP>

<P>My Adelaide! what joy to prove your probity unshaken, as your innocence is spotless! I should scarce wish to recover my for∣tune, but to render myself more worthy of your love.</P>

<P>Diable! Are you really my Lord Es∣mond? Oh, I am ruined!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ld. <HI>Esm.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>My ruin, I hope, will teach our nobility, instead of travelling to become the dupes of foreign sharpers, to stay at home and spend their fortunes amongst their honest te∣nants, who support their splendour—Trap, you have been long my gaoler, now I'll be yours;—but liberty shall be your punishment—hospi∣tality the lock of my prison—and honest Muns my turnkey, to give a welcome to the kind friend, social neighbour, and, above all, the stranger in distress.</P>
