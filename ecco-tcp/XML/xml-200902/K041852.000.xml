<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Spoken by Mr. SMITH.</BYLINE>
<SP>
<L>BOLD was the man, and senc'd in ev'ry part</L>
<L>With oak, and ten-fold brass about the heart,</L>
<L>To build a play who tortur'd first his brain,</L>
<L>And then dar'd launch it on this stormy main.</L>
<L>What tho', at first, he spreads his little sails</L>
<L>To Heav'n's indulgent and propitious gales,</L>
<L>As the land gradual lessens to his eye</L>
<L>He finds a troubled sea, and low'ring sky:</L>
<L>Envy, detraction, calumny, and spite,</L>
<L>Ra6ise a worse storm than when the winds unite.</L>
<L>Around his bark, in many a dang'rous shoal,</L>
<L>Those monsters of the deep, the critics, prowl.</L>
<L>"She's a weak vessel, for these seas unfit,</L>
<L>"And has on board her not a spice of wit:</L>
<L>"She's French-built too; of foreign make," they cry;</L>
<L>Like geese still cackling that the Gauls are nigh.</L>
<L>If thrown on rocks by the hoarse dashing wave,</L>
<L>Th' unhappy crew no hand is stretch'd to save;</L>
<L>But round the wreck, like Moors, with furious joy,</L>
<L>The witlings crowd—to murder and destroy,</L>
<L>These are known dangers; and, still full as certain,</L>
<L>The bard meets other ills behind the curtain.</L>
<L>Little you think, ere yet you fix his fate,</L>
<L>What previous mischiefs there in ambush wait;</L>
<L>What plagues arise from all the mimic throng:</L>
<L>"My part's too short;—and, Sir, my part's too long."</L>
<L><PB REF="4"/>This calls for incident; that repartee.</L>
<L>"Down the back-stairs pen an escape for me.</L>
<L>"Give me a ladder, Mr. Bayes, of rope;</L>
<L>"I love to wear the breeches, and elope.</L>
<L>"Something for me the groundlings ears to split.</L>
<L>"Write a dark closet, or a fainting-fit.</L>
<L>"Fix Woodward in some whimsical disgrace:</L>
<L>"Or be facetious with Ned Shuter's face."</L>
<L>This is our way; and yet our bard to night</L>
<L>Removes each obstacle, and springs to light.</L>
<L>Some scenes, we hope, he brings to nature true;</L>
<L>Some gleams of humour, and a moral too;</L>
<L>But no strange monsters offers to your view:</L>
<L>No forms, grotesque and wild, are here at strife:</L>
<L>He boasts an etching from the real life;</L>
<L>Exerts his efforts, in a polish'd age,</L>
<L>To drive the Smithfield muses from the stage;</L>
<L>By easy dialogue would win your praise,</L>
<L>And on fair decency graft all his bayes.</L>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">F</SEG>OR all that, Careless, I wish you had a little of that man in your composi∣tion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CARELESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Of him! of Wisely!—My dear Blunt, not for the wide world.—Wisely has, indeed, the name of a good sort of a sensible kind of man—and he is so—but the heart is never concerned in what he says or does.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BLUNT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, as to his heart, according to the way of the world—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="2" REF="8"/>
<SPEAKER>CARELESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>He has none, Sir; no heart at all: his affec∣tions are all contracted into a narrow attention to self; and his understanding acts the subservient part to schemes of interest.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BLUNT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why that is the very quality I wish you pos∣sessed a little of;—you would not then be lia∣ble to ridiculous miscarriages in every thing you undertake.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CARELESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>There! going again to harp upon my indis∣cretions. But prithee no more of that—I am wonderfully altered.—'Tis true, I have had hi∣therto an unguarded openness of temper; but that's all over.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BLUNT.</SPEAKER>
<P>All over!—My dear Careless, you will ne∣ver give it over. You are the very sieve of your own intentions, the Marplot of your own de∣signs.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CARELESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! no, no—I am very secret of late.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BLUNT.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Sdeath, man, I would as soon trust a secret with the printer of a daily paper.—Was it not but the other day you lost a seat in parliament by not keeping your own counsel?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CARELESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>There again now you wrong me: Sir William's interest was weaken'd, and—</P>
</SP>

<P>Psha! I know the whole affair: You blabbed the scheme, and a whisper from above to the cor∣poration undid you.</P>

<SPEAKER>CARELESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well! well! that has taught me wisdom.—</P>

<SP>

<P>Wisdom! have you said nothing of Lucinda lately?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CARELESS.</SPEAKER>

<P>Letter!—why—a—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BLUNT.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have shewn it; and there is captain Wim∣ble in a fury about a paragraph relating to him∣self.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CARELESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Captain Wimble!—I—I—now there, upon, my soul, I am very ill used.—I never shewed that letter to any body but Jack Tattle;—under the seal of secrecy too.—There is no such thing as trusting any body.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BLUNT.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was not he betray'd you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<SP>

<P>Not my lady Betty Gabble?</P>
</SP>

<P>My lady Betty! I—I repeated a passage to my lady Betty Gabble, merely by way of con∣versation.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>BLUNT.</SPEAKER>
<P>And by way of conversation you are for ever marring all your own schemes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="4" REF="10"/>
<SPEAKER>CARELESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, if that's the case, a Jew without re∣nouncing shall as soon gain admission to the Pope's toe, as any man get into my secrets again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BLUNT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Caution is necessary, let me tell you, Careless; men are inquisitive into other people's business.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CARELESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>So they are, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BLUNT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ridicule and raillery are the taste of the age: every one you meet is a pleasant fellow; he has picked up a character, an incident, a story, a damn'd high story; and so a friend is sacrificed to the sport of the next company.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CARELESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very true;—I find it so;—but I am a new man grown, notwithstanding all your criticisms upon my character.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BLUNT.</SPEAKER>
<P>A new man!—Why you have ruin'd yourself with Lucinda: She'll never marry you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CARELESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha! ha! you see now I can keep a secret.—Ha! ha! my dear Blunt, I don't intend to marry her.</P>
</SP>

<P>No!</P>

<P>No;—that has been settled this week; and tho' you and I live here at Windsor in the same house,—ha! ha!—I have kept it from you these six or seven days.</P>

<P>I have.—Ha! ha!—You must not be in the cabinet-council of my amours.—Ha! ha! tho'—ha! ha!—you will be surpriz'd when you know my reasons.—Ha! ha! the greatest thing in the world for me.—Ha! ha!</P>

<P>Yes, yes; that's absolutely necessary: it all de∣pends upon secrecy.—Ha! ha!—It's a pro∣digious hit.</P>

<P>You'll defeat it yourself. Thou'rt an honest fellow, Careless, and no one's enemy but your own.</P>

<P>Never fear me; ha! ha! you'll be rejoic'd when you hear it.—Ha! ha!</P>

<SPEAKER>CARELESS.</SPEAKER>
<P><Q>Hortensia's compliments to Mr. Careless; she thinks it vain to attempt concealing an inclination which he has raised in her heart, and which many circumstances must have al∣ready interpreted. She was at first alarmed at Mr. Careless's unguarded temper, but ex∣pects from his good sense an absolute silence, till every thing is concluded.</Q> You see, Blunt, she thinks differently of my character from what you do.—Ha! ha!</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CARELESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, I knew you would be glad to hear it.—Well now, a'n't I a very happy fellow?—Ha! ha!—This letter would be enough to break the heart of a rival; to make him challenge me, fight me, kill me.—Ha! ha!</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>WISELY.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be rejected by her, in whom beauty and good sense are still at strife for pre-eminence—
<PB N="15" REF="21"/>to be discarded by her, 'tis enough to drive the mind to madness—that is, I should think so, if the lady had engag'd my heart—Confusion! I had like to have detected myself. <STAGE>[Aside]</STAGE>—But I am glad to hear what you have told me.</P>

<P>Not much short; and in high spirits still.</P>

<P>Spirits! with one foot in the grave, he dances about the world, as if he was bit by a tarantula.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WISELY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why dancing is his ruling passion.</P>
</SP>

<P>So much, that he runs about to all the coun∣try assemblies, and is a <HI>beau garçon</HI> with all hu∣man infirmities.</P>

<SPEAKER>CARELESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; but not a single idea but what is de∣rived from dancing. If you ask him what sort of a place such a town is, "They have a very good Monday-night assembly." Or, if you de∣sire to know what kind of people, "They very often dance thirty couple."</P>

<SPEAKER>BELLFIELD.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so, my dear Lucinda, you think you know your own mind so well, that you can an∣swer for it, I shall never have the rights of an husband over that pretty person of yours.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LUCINDA.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, never; positively never.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELLFIELD.</SPEAKER>
<P>And, on my part, I positively pronounce that you will, one day or other, make me the happy man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LUCINDA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, Mr. Bellfield, have you a patent for my inclinations? or do you intend to lay violent hands upon a weak defenceless woman, and make me your own by force of arms?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELLFIELD.</SPEAKER>
<P>O fy! no force:—like a good-natur'd general I invite you to capitulate, rather than urge me to the necessity of carrying the town by storm.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LUCINDA.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I find the garrison still able to hold out.—The citadel <STAGE>[laying her hand on her heart]</STAGE> is still proof against all the artillery you have play'd off.—I think you have not been able to throw in much fire, Mr. Bellfield.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="20" REF="26"/>
<SPEAKER>BELLFIELD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha! ha! you little know that I have a secret friend in that very citadel, that will betray the place to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LUCINDA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed you flatter yourself;—There is not a single sentiment, not one desire or inclination here, that has ever whisper'd the smallest good word in your favour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELLFIELD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well, there is a little destiny in these matters—that's all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LUCINDA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Destiny! and so your system in love-affairs is like that of certain heroes in military matters.—You think, I suppose, that every heart, like every cannon-ball, has its billet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELLFIELD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Even so, madam. Nature, like a skilful bowler, delivers every heart out of hand with a secret bias to its proper object.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LUCINDA.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is something agreeably impudent in the fellow's vanity. <STAGE>[Aside]</STAGE> But you will al∣low that nature gives little secret antipathies too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELLFIELD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, certainly!—She delights in blending contradictions, in order to embellish the fair, and give her the graces of variety. A sort of mosaic work, where folly is inlaid with talents, a love of pleasure with virtue, a power of pleas∣ing with a delight in giving pain; and, as the poet says,</P>
<L><PB N="21" REF="27"/>"Fix'd principles with fancy ever new,</L>
<L>"Shakes all together, and produces you."</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LUCINDA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon my word this is altogether a new way of making love: By convincing me that you can with curious discernment spy out all the little foibles of the fair, you think to recommend yourself to my notice. Have a care, Mr. Bell∣field, remember Apollo's sentence upon the cri∣tic who found out all the faults in a celebrated poem: He laid before him a sack of wheat, and bid him separate the chaff, which he gave him for his pains.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELLFIELD.</SPEAKER>
<P>That, madam, was because the man was so un∣fortunate as to have no relish for the beauties; whereas my admiration—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LUCINDA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, Sir, you manage your admiration as cer∣tain prodigals do their money; you grudge the smallest part to your neighbours, and squander all most profusely on yourself: And therefore it is you have been entered in my black list; let me see how long—let me see <STAGE>[takes out a pocket∣book]</STAGE> Ay, this is it: <STAGE>[reads]</STAGE> <Q>A list of those I am determined not to marry.</Q> Let me see, <Q>Mr. Worthless condemn'd May the nineteenth, 1762.</Q></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELLFIELD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Worthless! what he that married the great fortune.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LUCINDA.</SPEAKER>
<P>And took on so prodigiously at her death.—He made love to me while he had weepers on
<PB N="22" REF="28"/>for his deceas'd wife; and so I hated him for an impostor, worse than Maria does Dr. Wolfe, in the Nonjuror.—But where are you, you crea∣ture? "Lord Hazard." This was a man of rank, with a pale quality face, and a genteel, enervated figure. I perceiv'd by his passion for play, that the queen of trumps was in his eyes the greatest beauty in the world; so I acquaint∣ed his lordship that I had no further occasion for his services; and he told his friends that he resign'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELLFIELD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha! ha!—I see plainly I must be the man.</P>
<STAGE>[Aside.]</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LUCINDA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Where the deuce is your name? "More-love—Ranger—Dorimant—Blackacre."—Well, this Mr. Blackacre was a perfect curiosity: In∣stead of saying civil things of my person, he talked of nothing but my estate, and assured me when the present leases expired he would let the whole at an improv'd rent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELLFIELD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why such a fellow was fitter to be bailiff or steward of your manor.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LUCINDA.</SPEAKER>
<P>There was something handsome about him too;—no, not handsome neither—I don't know how to describe him: A sort of symmetry of features, and a faint bloom that made a comely kind of deformity. No symptoms of sensibili∣ty; no expression of a feeling mind; and he ap∣peared to me likely to make that sort of hus∣band, who has no manner of vice, gets up in
<PB N="23" REF="29"/>a morning regularly, eats his breakfast, looks over his accounts, goes to the coffee-house, comes home to dinner, reads his letters, goes to the coffee-house again, reads the evening-papers, comes home to supper, and goes to-bed.—Ha! ha!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELLFIELD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha! ha! Why you give portraits in minia∣ture as well as any painter of them all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LUCINDA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha! ha! I laugh whenever I think of the man.—He brought me all the news of the day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELLFIELD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LUCINDA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, all; but none that I valued; no news about the little victories this figure obtain'd in the world; no advices of what was said about my last new cap—the happy arrangement of a patch; no intelligence about a particular bloom of my complexion; never came with a <Q>We hear from Ranelagh that Lucinda's eyes scat∣tered death and torment among all the beaus last Friday-night.</Q> No, no such thing; it was all political intelligence; and, being a fa∣vourite, I had it warm from the mint. At ten in the morning, there was an action in Germa∣ny, and the French lost ten thousand men upon the field of battle, three princes of the blood, and five marshals of France. At twelve, the news was premature. At two, an express was arriv'd at the secretary of state's. In the evening, the victory was not so complete; and a no∣ble lord was heard to say, that if a certain gene∣ral
<PB N="24" REF="30"/>had done his duty, the balance of Europe would have been settled. At night, the whole report was false, and there was no battle at all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELLFIELD.</SPEAKER>
<P>You would have had all the joys of dear vari∣ety with such an husband.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LUCINDA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, horrid!—I told him at length, that I could not consider him in the light of a lover; but that really he was a very good news-paper; and that whenever he was out of hand, or not bespoke, I should be glad to be entertain'd with the topic of the day.—Ha! ha!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELLFIELD.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so order'd your servants to take him in, instead of the Chronicle, or Public Ledger.—Ha! ha!—By laughing at all her lovers, she is determined to have me. <STAGE>[Aside.]</STAGE>—Upon my soul, Lucinda, you have a very pretty groupe of humourists.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LUCINDA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Enough to furnish our a comedy.—The vain, the proud, the formal, the brisk, every species of the ridiculous and absurd, has been my most obedient, very humble servant.—And here—here's another character, to help out the piece— "Mr. Bellfield."</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELLFIELD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, let us hear.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LUCINDA.</SPEAKER>
<P><Q>Condemn'd, August the sixteenth, 1763, for looking at himself in the glass for a full half hour, while he was directing his discourse
<PB N="25" REF="31"/>to me.</Q> There, you are out-law'd for open rebellion against my beauty—hold up your hand—and what have you to say, why judgment of death should not pass upon you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELLFIELD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, I have your pardon in my pocket.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LUCINDA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, to be sure, I, who claim homage from every pretty fellow, am likely to forgive the dis∣affected person who disputes my title, and be∣comes a vain pretender to it himself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELLFIELD.</SPEAKER>
<P>How can you talk thus, when you know I have worshipp'd you even to idolatry, and have offer'd up prayers on my very knees to you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LUCINDA.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I require true devotion in your prayers. Would it not provoke the patience of a saint to have a well-powder'd fop kneel at his shrine, with a "There's a handsome fellow for you; mind my cloaths, Brussels lace, diamond-ring, saucy snuff-box, and impudent face?" And this too under the notion of asking a blessing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELLFIELD.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear Lucinda, I never knew you so much out. Would not you have a man go to his prayers with a good conscience? And what are the pleasures of a good conscience? The ap∣plauses of one's own heart.—Now, my dear ma'am, if, when I approach you, I have some self-approving airs, am not I therefore the better intitled to you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="26" REF="32"/>
<SPEAKER>LUCINDA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Heav'ns! I am frighten'd at you.—You are a free-thinker in love:—Preach this doctrine to the ladies, and they will call it downright heresy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELLFIELD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very like. But surely, were I to make my advances with darts, and flames, and Cupid, and Venus, and the Graces, I should be a meer uninstructed pagan. Whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eas, at present, I only want to discard superstition, and idle ce∣remonials, and so establish the true system of love.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LUCINDA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Which you take to consist in—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELLFIELD.</SPEAKER>
<P>In the language of the heart.—As instance—I love you, shall study your happiness, and so let me call the parson.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LUCINDA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Easy and impudent!—But love's religion is a sort of popery, and requires penance, and fast∣ing, and watching, and that you should pray for favours in a language almost unintelligible.—But you say your prayers in the vulgar tongue: "And so let me call the parson." Why you might as well come most cavalierly to my house, take possession of an arm chair, and, <Q>Here, bring me my night-gown and slippers.</Q></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELLFIELD.</SPEAKER>
<P>And as all the sighs, and verses, and fine things of lovers, must end in that, you had bet∣ter wave ceremony; for as to Careless, tho' you may think you have hold of his heart—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="27" REF="33"/>
<SPEAKER>LUCINDA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Careless!—I desire you will never mention him.—Careless!—A senseless wretch!—A vile inconstant!—who abandons me as if age had suddenly rendered me loathlome.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELLFIELD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, faith, though I detest the treachery, I can't, upon this occasion, quarrel with the trai∣tor.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LUCINDA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, Sir, I dare say you applaud his conduct; and would like him declare, that I might pass very well for a mistress, to toy an hour with, and must shortly come to that.—But for a wife—oh, shocking!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELLFIELD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Has he dar'd talk thus, Lucinda?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LUCINDA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Even to the lowest wretch on earth; to that fellow, La Jeunesse, who dress'd my hair about half an hour ago.—Oh, if my brother were in England, he should find I do not want a friend to assert my honour.</P>

<P>The old philosopher, Sir, lov'd the elegant arts. And there was Scaliger a man of great learning, and an eminent critic—he danc'd a Pyrrhic dance—a dance well known to the ancients, Mr. Care∣less.—Scaliger, Sir, danc'd a Pyrrhic dance, to the astonishment of all Germany.

<P>The same; turn'd of fourteen years; just now in her fifteenth; and the sweetest face, prettiest feet, and the finest here—the finest chest;—coming forward—coming forward charmingly. I danc'd with her at the last assem∣bly at Sunning-hill.</P>

<SPEAKER>CARELESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well done, knight.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR PHILIP.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hey, lads! was not it bold to undertake her so young?—I can match Hercules for labour in a country-dance. I began the minuets with my lady Portsoken:—A fine, comely, responsible woman is my lady Portsoken—moves a minuet like a cathedral.—Indeed a slight accident hap∣pen'd to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CARELESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay; what was that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR PHILIP.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Sir, in the harmonious movement un∣der the great branch in the middle of the room, an unlucky hook took a fancy to my wig—I lost the honours of my head, Sir; they were suspended in air, and I mov'd thro' my minuet, quite insen∣sible of the disaster.</P>

<SPEAKER>CARELESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha! ha! my dear knight, an unlucky acci∣dent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR PHILIP.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, no; nothing—I did not mind it; a few lampoons, epigrams, and little lutestring verses for the summer-season, flew about: I danced

The feet of his verse might be very good, but my feet were never the worse. I laughed, and answer'd him out of Horace, <HI>Nunc pede libero pulsanda tellus.</HI></P>

<P>No, Sir; nothing grieves me; I dance away my cares: I have no head for thought and trou∣ble,

<P>Well, I challenge the world for such another philosopher.</P>

<P>I call myself a peripatetic philosopher.—I go about for the serenity of my mind.—I had a letter yesterday from my attorney to meet him on Monday next, at the Mitre tavern in Fleet-street, in order to sign deeds of lease and release for a small estate in Berkshire, a little out at el∣bows; but I have appointed him to meet me at the Long Room at Hampstead.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HORTENSIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>But won't you allow me to be deeper in my own secrets than any body else?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LUCINDA.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, by no means; we are all very ingenious in deceiving ourselves: Our passions wear so ma∣ny cunning disguises, we hardly know them.—Spleen shall pass for wit, avarice <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>onomy;
<PB N="41" REF="47"/>and the love of a man shall often be thought a mere female vanity, in hearing the praises of a shape or a feature.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HORTENSIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>So that if I suffer a civil thing from a pretty fellow, the pleasure I find from the compli∣ment makes a quick transition to a liking of the man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LUCINDA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Instantly, and almost imperceptibly to our∣selves. And when we think we are putting him off, with our arts of cold delay, it is at the bot∣tom but mere coquetry, to draw him on the more. Like playing with edge tools, till we cut ourselves.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LUCINDA.</SPEAKER>
<P>I beg your pardon:—There is in you se∣rious people a sedate love of pleasure that we giddy creatures never come up to. We receive slight impressions, and slight impressions chatter away, and evaporate in the whirl of our fancy. Now you demure ones dwell upon what gains access to your hearts; and then your thoughts are like what they tell me of white powder:—They make no noise, but are full of mis∣chief.</P>

<P>This is very strange.—But let me assure you, I have not forgot my poor deceas'd hus∣band.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LUCINDA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay; but that tender melancholy will so dis∣pose your mind to receive the kindred passion of love, that I should not wonder if—in short, grief is very amorous, my dear.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HORTENSIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mighty fine!—But the man who makes me sacrifice my liberty must have an extraordinary merit.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LUCINDA.</SPEAKER>
<P>There again now!—Another of the mas∣querade habits our passions wear:—When you are in love with a man's person, you fancy it is a refin'd esteem for his merit.—Oh, Horten∣sia! under that illusion the heart of a woman will soften and melt prodigiously.—Do you think it possible to have a lasting esteem for a man, merely on the score of his merit?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HORTENSIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Surely; is not it natural to love virtue?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LUCINDA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, to speak a plain truth, which I would not have a man hear from me for the world, whims, passions, and desires, are the ground-works of our minds; and virtue, I am afraid, is but in-laid.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LUCINDA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, if there is any lady really smitten, the dispute between her love and her delicacy will not last long.—Delicacy may talk of nice points of honour; but that will only reach the head: While every syllable from that little urchin Love will make its way directly to the heart; and while Delicacy is reading lectures, Love will persuade, and so the business is over.—

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HORTENSIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's right, Lucinda; give me your hand, and take my advice:—If the false man deserts you, shew yourself a girl of spirit on the occa∣sion.—The wretch is not worth a single smile from any of our sex;—an idle, vain boaster!—to trust him is taking up water with a sieve.—So resolve at once to look down with scorn both on him, and the vain beauty that prides her∣self in the conquest:—Wish her joy of her bargain, my dear, and think no more about him.</P>

<P><STAGE>[With a sneer.]</STAGE> I promise you, you shall never receive such another.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>CARELESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I return it to you most joyfully.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>HORTENSIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well, Sir! you return a fond letter thus with scorn.</P>

<SPEAKER>CARELESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fond do you call it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HORTENSIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Was it no fondness to tell you here— <STAGE>[opens the letter.]</STAGE> What's this? oh, I see through this too! Now blush for your indiscretion, weak, trifling man! This very letter I sent Mr. Wise∣ly, when first my foolish heart seduc'd me to listen to your addresses.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CARELESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Shame and confusion! ideot that I was!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HORTENSIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>How paltry do you appear now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CARELESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>I feel it all.—And yet will you suffer him, Wisely, to succeed in so ungenerous a plot?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HORTENSIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>He has acted like a man of sense: he has at once shewn me his own prudence, and the infir∣mity of your frivolous mind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CARELESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>But in all my conduct you see no marks of guilt, no treachery, no—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HORTENSIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, it is to me the same thing if an idle im∣becility of understanding assumes the appear∣ance, or acts the purposes, of every vice in its turn.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CARELESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>And can you thus, for a small failure—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="86" REF="92"/>
<SPEAKER>HORTENSIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Small failure do you call it? Mr. Wisely has deserv'd me, and I'll bestow myself upon him this very day, to shew the value I have for the man who has honour enough to keep a woman's secrets, and the contempt due to the wretch who, like you, can trifle with a generous heart.</P>
<STAGE>Exit.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CARELESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hell and the devil! I shall never be able to shew my face after this:—Blunt will rail at me, my enemies will rejoice, and every female tongue will clack, clack.—Confusion!—What's to be done?—I'll follow her to Sir Philip's mask; and from this moment not one unguarded word shall ever escape me. <STAGE>Exit.</STAGE></P>

<P>Well, step and speak to her once more. <STAGE>[<HI>Exit</HI> Bellfield.]</STAGE> This will finish him with Hortensia. <STAGE>[Aside.]</STAGE>—The levity of this man, Sir Philip, his own folly, has put it in my power to do you this service.—Hush! I see Careless coming; I know his dress.</P>

<P>And there's comes my wife; I know her dress too.</P>

<SPEAKER>LUCINDA.</SPEAKER>
<P>I've something to say to you first:—I hear you're going to marry that flirt, Lucinda.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CARELESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lucinda!—Ha! ha!—That will never be!—Marry her!—A proud insolent, who over-rates both her beauty and her fortune.—I never had a sincere regard for her; I gave the girl hopes, and pamper'd her vain imagination, but I never liked her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LUCINDA.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am glad to hear that;—I am afraid her cha∣racter is not the best.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CARELESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>If it has a flaw, she uses it like broken china; patches it up as well as she can, and turns the fairest side to view.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LUCINDA.</SPEAKER>
<P>But then you'll marry Hortensia.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CARELESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>That will be as things happen.—But as to her, she'll be of no inconvenience to our amours; I shall always be able to detach a part of my time from her, in order to dedicate it more happily to love and joy with your ladyship.</P>

<P>Don't alarm yourself. <STAGE>[Drawing up the curtain, and looking towards her.]</STAGE> Your ladyship will be well in a moment.—Sir Philip will never sus∣pect, or be able to find us out.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR PHILIP.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>[Following him.]</STAGE> Mr. Careless, this is the vilest proceeding—the basest usage, Sir—the wicked∣est dssign—it's enough to put a body in a pas∣sion.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>CARELESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Zoons! what shall I do now?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR PHILIP.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did not think you capable of this—nor your ladyship either:—Come, shew your face, madam, and let me see how guilt becomes it.— <STAGE>[Takes off her mask.]</STAGE> Lucinda all this time!</P>

<P>Every thing that's harsh, I make no doubt.—Blunt, you see what a condition I'm in here.</P>

<SPEAKER>HORTENSIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Sir, your presence is necessary:—You shall be a witness to an act of justice.—Mr. Wisely, I now acknowledge before this company, that I have behaved indelicately to you:—But now Sir, without ceremony, I give you my hand; at once to make atonement for my past conduct, and to shew that wretch the just reward of secrecy in love.</P>

<SPEAKER>WISELY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Generous Hortensia!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LUCINDA.</SPEAKER>
<P>And, to do full and ample justice on him, Mr. Bellfield, I have been a very tyrant to you. I have used you like—What was your simile, Mr. Careless?—My airs were too thin for a lover to subsist upon; and so now I'll let in a lit∣tle common-sense to keep him alive—Here, take me, Mr. Bellfield, that the gentleman may also see the just reward of sincerity in love.</P>
