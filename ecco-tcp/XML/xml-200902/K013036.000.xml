<HEAD>THE SHADOWS OF SHAKESPEARE.</HEAD>
<LG N="1">
<HEAD>I.</HEAD>
<L>SOON as the breath of Rumour blew</L>
<L>This solemn theme into the general ear,</L>
<L>To holy Solitude I flew,</L>
<L>And bade the Muse her sympathy prepare!</L>
<L>There closeted with <HI>Thought,</HI></L>
<L>The brain its shapeless travail wrought!</L>
<L>The season to the subject solemnly did suit:</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="4"/>
Day's dazzling orb was wholly down;</L>
<L>Pale Cynthia sat upon her silver throne;</L>
<L>Th' obtrusions of the light were clos'd</L>
<L>It seem'd, as SILENCE <HI>self</HI> repos'd,</L>
<L>For with the Air, the Earth and all her sons were mute:</L>
<L>All but the <HI>wretched,</HI> who like me,</L>
<L>The gentle vigils kept of sympathy.</L>
<L>With cordial awe I hail'd the shading night,</L>
<L>And kiss'd her dusky robe which muffled thus the light.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="2">
<HEAD>II.</HEAD>
<L>Base busy World, begone, <HI>begone,</HI> I said,</L>
<L>To mighty GARRICK yield the serious mind,</L>
<L>This awful <HI>Now</HI> be sacred to the dead,</L>
<L>And turn the cautious key on human kind.</L>
</LG>

<PB N="7" REF="5"/>
<HEAD>III.</HEAD>
<L>The Dead—ah, me!—<HI>what</HI> dead?—Here it began</L>
<L>The florid Poet felt himself a Man.</L>
<L>And is <HI>he</HI> dead, whose wonder-working art</L>
<L>So often <HI>tore,</HI> and <HI>touch'd,</HI> and <HI>tun'd</HI> the heart?</L>
<L>Whose piercing <HI>eye</HI> intelligence could give,</L>
<L>And bid <HI>long-buried</HI> beings look and live?</L>
<L>Whose voice enrich'd the verse <HI>his Shakespeare</HI> writ,</L>
<L>And gave to every word its weight of wit;</L>
<L>No sentence blemish'd, marr'd no golden line,</L>
<L>But <HI>polish'd,</HI> as he drew it from the mine;</L>
<L>Whose tongue grew wanton in his Shakespeare's cause,</L>
<L>And gave to crowded Theatres their laws;</L>
<L>Whose powerful accents, soften'd or sublime,</L>
<L>Free from all frippery, false pause, false chime,</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="6"/>
Chain'd, as to th' attracting centre, every ear;</L>
<L>And, all commanding, sawy'd the smile and tear:</L>
<L>Is it to Him the Muse must pay</L>
<L>Her tributary lay?</L>
<L>For <HI>him,</HI> must aching Memory pour the strain,</L>
<L>Must she her darling GARRICK'S loss complain?</L>
</LG>
<LG N="4">
<HEAD>IV.</HEAD>
<L>The heart was hurt—It could no more—</L>
<L>Along each finer nerve swift shot the misery,</L>
<L>Even <HI>Nature</HI> shed her pensive shower;</L>
<L>The mighty Mother wept, alas! with me:</L>
<L>Th' imperial Goddess mourn'd her own decay,</L>
<L>(Mix'd universal with our human clay)</L>
<L>And wish'd she could a <HI>second</HI> birth bestow</L>
<L>On this her <HI>Representative below.</HI></L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="7"/>
But, ah! it cannot be,</L>
<L>So the rich debt was paid, to poor <HI>Humanity.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG N="5">
<HEAD>V.</HEAD>
<L>Then in the sable stole of woe,</L>
<L>All conscious of the blow,</L>
<L>Pale her cheek, her eye declining,</L>
<L>Half obedient, half repining;</L>
<L>Her visage mark'd by many a tear,</L>
<L>(Pour'd from the crystal source of grief sincere)</L>
<L>In awful state,</L>
<L>Unfortunate and great,</L>
<L>MELPOMENE came on,</L>
<L>Afflicted for her Son,</L>
<L>And thrice, methought, the BOWL she lifted high,</L>
<L>And thrice she threw on Heaven the pity-moving eye;</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="8"/>
Then, like the statue of Despair,</L>
<L>Stood fix'd—her DAGGER pois'd in air.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="6">
<HEAD>VI.</HEAD>
<L>Now 'twas THALIA first conceiv'd a <HI>pain,</HI></L>
<L>'Twas now she echo'd back her sister's sighs again;</L>
<L>The jest, the laugh, the look, were o'er,</L>
<L>Her cunning was no more;</L>
<L>The comic mirth, the comic pride,</L>
<L>Her wit, her whim, with GARRICK dy'd;</L>
<L>Disdainful then the mask she flung</L>
<L>To vacant air—and thus forlorn she sung:</L>
<L>And ah! away with random rhyme,</L>
<L>Tinsel, ill-suited to the time;</L>
<L>Away with leisure's coxcomb line,</L>
<L>The couplet quaint, the stanza fine;</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="9"/>
Far from <HI>our</HI> verse be now the pun, the point,</L>
<L>The period measured joint by joint;</L>
<L>Th' elaborate <HI>trade</HI> of poesy forbear—</L>
<L>Or rather paint the workings of despair;</L>
<L>Scorn the vain edging <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>able Verse assumes,</L>
<L>And let dark <HI>Elegy</HI> pass on, in all her pompous plumes.</L>
<L>The honour of the Dead in view,</L>
<L>A juster path will we pursue;</L>
<L>SHAKESPEARE HIMSELF, who best our state can feel,</L>
<L>Shall the sad tale in his <HI>own language</HI> tell.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="7">
<HEAD>VII.</HEAD>
<L>Th' inspiring Goddess, mortals FANCY name,</L>
<L>With all her magic arm'd, now near me came</L>
<L>Her waving wand, deep midnight deeper made,</L>
<L>With her I went—to where our GARRICK laid.</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="10"/>
Cynthia lent a feeble ray,</L>
<L>To light us on our way!</L>
<L>FANCY with printless footsteps trod,</L>
<L>As if advancing towards a GOD!</L>
<L>Methought we easy entrance found,</L>
<L>And the drear Abbey walk'd around.</L>
<L>How fearful thus, ye Heavens! to tread,</L>
<L>The dampsome vaults which close the dead!</L>
</LG>
<LG N="8">
<HEAD>VIII.</HEAD>
<L>But soft—</L>
<L>As at the foot of mighty SHAKESPEARE'S tomb</L>
<L>I kneel—sudden along the fretted ailes</L>
<L>Innumerous SHADY FORMS, by the pale moon's</L>
<L>Imperfect beam beheld, — in various guise—</L>
<L>(Each in the habit worn in days of Nature)</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="11"/>
Appear, and pour their potent spells upon me!</L>
<L>Aw'd by a sight so strange, aloft I stood,</L>
<L>And wist not what to do:—the figures <HI>mov'd!</HI></L>
<L>On near approach I knew them for the TRAIN</L>
<L>Of SHAKESPEARE: In procession sad,</L>
<L>Strait, one by one his hallow'd homage paid</L>
<L>O'er GARRICK'S grave all bending.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="9">
<HEAD>IX.</HEAD>
<L>ARIEL first,</L>
<L>(Not sight-deceiving, as her custom was,</L>
<L>When in the bowels of the earth she div'd;</L>
<L>"Or mounted on the sharp wind of the North,</L>
<L>"Or on the curling clouds, or sunny ray,</L>
<L>"Nor like a spirit at ease") but with step</L>
<L>Deliberate—She, and her fellow-ministers,</L>
<L><PB N="14" REF="12"/>
("Brimful of sorrow and dismay") stood mute,</L>
<L>Then gaz'd upon the grave, — then sunk in sighs.</L>

<LG N="10">
<HEAD>X.</HEAD>
<L>PROSPERO,</L>
<L>The great magician, next—(whose high command</L>
<L>"Wak'd sleepers in their graves, and let them forth")</L>
<L>Beheld the vanishing instruments of 's art,</L>
<L>And spake—</L>
<L>"Have <HI>ye,</HI> which are but <HI>air,</HI></L>
<L>"A touch, a feeling of our loss extreme;</L>
<L>"And shall not <HI>I,</HI> one of his <HI>kind,</HI> be <HI>kindlier?</HI></L>
<L>"Our revel then is done; and this our <HI>Actor</HI></L>
<L>"Is no more! Lost is the book of Conjuration:—</L>
<L>"He regulated all our mystic charms:—He's dead!</L>
<L>"The cloud-capt tow'rs, the gorgeous palaces,</L>
<L><PB N="15" REF="13"/>
"The solemn temples, the great globe itself;</L>
<L>"Yea, all which it inherit, shall dissolve,</L>
<L>"And, like the baseless fabrick of a vision,</L>
<L>"Leave not a wreck behind."</L>
</LG>
<LG N="11">
<HEAD>XI.</HEAD>
<L>He said, and pass'd.</L>
<L>The <HI>weir'd Sisters</HI> then, hag-born and horrid,</L>
<L>Mutter'd <HI>their</HI> melancholy homage hoarse;</L>
<L>Cold distillations of distress extreme</L>
<L>Fell down the furrows of each wint'ry cheek:</L>
<L>Thrice pac'd they piteous round the hallow'd earth,</L>
<L>Acknowledging their Lord. To GARRICK'S grave,</L>
<L>Bow'd every <HI>swarthy She.</HI>—To end their rites,</L>
<L>Imagination's OWL flapp'd her fell wing,</L>
<L>And, wailing, shriek'd as 'cross the dome she slew:</L>
<L><PB N="16" REF="14"/>
Sudden, the whirring wizards disappear,</L>
<L>And <HI>horse</HI> themselves upon the viewless winds.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="12">
<HEAD>XII.</HEAD>
<L>The gentle ROMEO was the third which came;</L>
<L>And oh! he said, "Turn back dull Earth—ah, me!</L>
<L>"Can I go forward when my <HI>friend</HI> is here?</L>
<L>"It is even so—Then I defy you stars!</L>
<L>"Romeo shall never <HI>more</HI> be Romeo now</L>
<L>"His occupation's gone."—</L>
</LG>
<LG N="13">
<HEAD>XIII.</HEAD>
<L>The noble CORIOLANUS was the fourth,</L>
<L>Whose very shade look'd martial—firm he strode,</L>
<L>And thus with Roman dignity exclaim'd,</L>
<L>In honour of the Dead:</L>
<L><PB N="17" REF="15"/>
"<HI>My</HI> fame like <HI>thine</HI></L>
<L>"Demands an equal voice, an equal tongue:</L>
<L>"All eyes spoke of thee, and the bleared sights</L>
<L>"Were spectacled to see thee—the veil'd dames</L>
<L>"Commit the wave of white and damask, in</L>
<L>"Their nicely gauded cheeks, to th'wanton spoil</L>
<L>"Of Phoebus' burning kisses: such a pother,</L>
<L>"As if that whatsoever God that tun'd thy throat</L>
<L>"Were slyly crept into thy human powers,</L>
<L>"To give thee grace and posture. Oft, great shade!</L>
<L>"The dumb men throng'd to <HI>see</HI> thee, and the blind</L>
<L>"To <HI>hear</HI> thee speak. To thee have Nobles bended,</L>
<L>"As to Jove's Statue; and the Commons made</L>
<L>"A shower and thunder with their caps and shouts</L>
<L>"As ne'er were seen the like."—The soldier pass'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="14">
<PB N="18" REF="16"/>
<HEAD>XIV.</HEAD>
<L>The fifth sad spirit that stalk'd by was LEAR'S,</L>
<L>Mad as the vext sea still; and singing oft;</L>
<L>Crown'd, as of old, by Shakespeare's hand; with fumiter,</L>
<L>With hardocks, hemlocks, nettles, cuckoo flowers,</L>
<L>Darnel, and all the idle weeds that grow</L>
<L>In the suftaining corn—</L>
<L>At sight of GARRICK'S tomb his wounds again</L>
<L>Bled fresh. Tottering he mov'd; his words were wild.</L>
<L>"You do me wrong to call me out o' th' grave!</L>
<L>"And yet I know thee, Man!—Heav'n has thee now!</L>
<L>"Thou wer't Lear's friend.—In faith I do remember.—</L>
<L>"Yes, we were both as stout a pair:—but why</L>
<L>"This truant disposition? Is the <HI>greatest</HI> man</L>
<L>"So poor and forked an animal in death?—</L>
<L><PB N="19" REF="17"/>
"Off, off, you lendings, come unbutton here—Poor shade!</L>
<L>"No more of that, no more of that.—</L>
</LG>
<LG N="15">
<HEAD>XV.</HEAD>
<L>The figure swift succeeding was the THANE'S,</L>
<L>Languid and penitent.—His hand he wav'd</L>
<L>As 'twere in honour of the man, whose voice</L>
<L>Did blow his base design in every ear:</L>
<L>Malice was dead within him, and he wept;</L>
<L>Then striking thrice his bosom, <HI>thus</HI> he cried:</L>
<L>"Oh Nature! how thyself thou blazon'dst</L>
<L>"In this thy Son; form'd in thy prodigality</L>
<L>"To hold <HI>thy</HI> mirror up, and give the time</L>
<L>"Its very <HI>form</HI> and <HI>pressure:</HI>—when he spoke</L>
<L>"Each <HI>aged</HI> ear play'd truant at his tales,</L>
<L>"And <HI>younger</HI> hearers were quite ravish'd;</L>
<L><PB N="20" REF="18"/>
"So valuable was his discourse.—Yet, being dead,</L>
<L>"I am a man again!"—He rush'd along.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="16">
<HEAD>XVI.</HEAD>
<L>The gallant ANTHONY then onward strode</L>
<L>And paus'd—as 'erst o'er Caesar's corse:—then spake:</L>
<L>"Thou art the ruins of the noblest man</L>
<L>"That ever liv'd in the tide of Times!</L>
<L>"Here was an Actor—when comes such ANOTHER?</L>
</LG>
<LG N="17">
<HEAD>XVII.</HEAD>
<L>The next a <HI>female</HI> form, of PERCY's line,</L>
<L>A race for ever noble—thus <HI>her</HI> tribute gave:</L>
<L>—"Thou wert the very glass</L>
<L>"Wherein the noblest youth did <HI>dress</HI> themselves;</L>
<L>"There were no <HI>legs</HI> that practis'd not <HI>thy gait;</HI></L>
<L><PB N="21" REF="19"/>
"There were no <HI>eyes</HI> that practis'd not thy looks;</L>
<L>"Even those that spoke but low and tardily</L>
<L>"Would turn their own <HI>perfections</HI> to abuse,</L>
<L>"To seem like Thee: So that in speech, in gait,</L>
<L>"In accents, and affections of delight,</L>
<L>"Thou wert the mark and glass, copy and book,</L>
<L>"To fashion others; and on <HI>thee,</HI> as on</L>
<L>"<HI>My</HI> Harry and the Sun, bright <HI>Honour</HI> stuck,</L>
<L>"As sticks the Sun in the grey vault of Heaven."</L>
</LG>
<LG N="18">
<HEAD>XVIII.</HEAD>
<L>And now, the melancholy JAQUES advanc'd,</L>
<L>And, full of matter, thus in few, exclaim'd:</L>
<L>"Why all the World's a stage,</L>
<L>"And all the Men and Women merely players:</L>
<L>"They have their <HI>exits</HI> and their entrances;</L>
<L><PB N="22" REF="20"/>
"And THIS MAN, in his time, play'd many parts.</L>
<L>"<HI>Life!</HI> No more on't; it is a tale, told</L>
<L>"By an idiot, signifying nothing."</L>
</LG>
<LG N="19">
<HEAD>XIX.</HEAD>
<L>At last, with philosophic step,</L>
<L>Swift-streaming eye, and arms entwined close,</L>
<L>The sacred shade of his OWN HAMLET came:</L>
<L>Long time he paus'd—long time around he look'd,</L>
<L>Then fix'd his view upon the grave, and spoke:</L>
<L>"'Tis not <HI>now, seems;</HI> in verity, it <HI>is;</HI></L>
<L>"Oh, what a grace was seated on that brow!</L>
<L>"An <HI>eye,</HI> like Mars, to threaten or command;</L>
<L>"A combination and a form indeed,</L>
<L>"Where every God did seem to set his seal,</L>
<L>"To give the world assurance of a Man!</L>
<L><PB N="23" REF="21"/>
"And is it come to this?—but hush, my heart!</L>
<L>"He was a Man, take him for all in all,</L>
<L>"We may not look upon his like aga</L>

<HEAD>XX.</HEAD>
<L>While wrapt in wonder of these various shews</L>
<L>The sovereign shade of SHAKESPEARE awful rose,</L>
<L>His many-colour'd wand he wav'd,</L>
<L>And soon the mournful train again were grav'd.</L>
<L>(Now was His genius even more divine,)</L>
<L>And all <HI>alone</HI> he stood before <HI>his</HI> GARRICK'S shrine.</L>
<L>Rest, rest, perturbed spirits, then, he said,</L>
<L>To <HI>me</HI> belongs th'inestimable dead;</L>
<L>To each 'tis given to breathe, to fall;</L>
<L>'Tis the fix'd lot of all that soar or crawl.</L>

For <HI>Thee,</HI> much honour'd friend,</L>
<L>What glories mark'd thy end!</L>
<L>Applauding nations own thy fame,</L>
<L>And, with their SHAKSPEARE'S, blend their GARRICK'S name.</L>
<L>Together then we mount on high,</L>
<L>'Tis OUR'S to TRIUMPH, 'tis the WORLD'S to SIGH.</L>
