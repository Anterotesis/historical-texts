<SPEAKER>BETTY.</SPEAKER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">L</SEG>ORD, Miss Maria, not dressed yet! —Why, there'll be a world of folks here, presently,—especially as my master has given it out that he in∣tends keeping open house till the day of Election, in favour of Sir Harry Simple.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't talk to me of dress, nor Sir Harry nei∣ther; I hate him;—I wish <HI>he</HI> had been fixed to a stake, and burnt yesterday instead of his effigy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BETTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>O fie Miss, you should not wish such cruel wishes as that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed I do. But prithee trouble me no more about <HI>him;</HI> have you seen Mr. Trueman to-day?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BETTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Love, as the saying is, has given him wings: I saw him fly by the house, once or twice, but
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>could not get to speak to him. He's purely busy, in Squire Artful's cause, not indeed out of any respect to him, but merely to oppose that goose Simple.—Well, I <HI>do</HI> think it a whimsical notion of my master, not to marry his daughter, but to one of those <HI>yea-and-nay</HI> creatures, called a Mem∣ber of Parliament.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Marry, Betty!—Why, if he carries his Elec∣tion, I won't have him.—I'd run to Scotland first; —a poor shallow-pated fop; so he may save him∣self both the trouble and expence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BETTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>So say I, Miss. To be sure, Mr. Trueman is a much more <HI>properer</HI> man, and, as we say in our country, <HI>has</HI> got some guts in his brains.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>If it was not for my mamma, my pappa would be well enough, but, she's always dinging in his ears, family, places, interest, and such stuff. For my part, I don't see what interest she'd have, if all her relations were in parliament, unless it were to frank her nonsense into every part of the king∣dom, which now she can't convey, without adding something to the revenue.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BETTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why there would be something in that, and not the worse for us; for, the more she'd write, the less she'd talk. But—bless me; who comes yonder! If Mr. Trueman is not coming thro' the hall, in disguise, with some of the folks!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is he indeed!—run, then, Betty, and take care, neither my pappa and mamma comes into the room while he is here.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>TRUEMAN, <HI>looking about.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Hist!—Maria,—are we alone?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>I would not for the world, Mr. Trueman, any of the family should see you here; I should lead a weary life, if they did.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TRUEMAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>It happens very fortunately for us, that your father now keeps open house, as I can slip in and out unperceived; I provided this dress on pur∣pose, as in case we <HI>should</HI> be seen together, I may pass off undiscovered.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Twas a good thought; but, tell me, how have you sped?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TRUEMAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>As well as I could wish. I <HI>do</HI> believe the day's our own: Artful readily accepted of my services, and I have been indefatigable in his interest; up, night and day; you see my life, what <HI>you</HI> can spur me to. I shall think my labour well repaid, if but at last I call Maria, <HI>mine.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>I make no doubt, but both my pappa and mam∣ma may be brought to give their consent, if we can but upset this scheme of Simple's.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TRUEMAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never doubt it. I'll try <HI>my</HI> best for it. I hav'n't been within a pair of sheets these six nights; no
<PB N="6" REF="6"/>messenger, or mail-carrier, has rid at once more miles, with greater expedition than I, in canvas∣sing this country for Votes. But, when Love dictates, its votaries must obey.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, Mr. Trueman, I am greatly obliged to you, and, heartily wish you may succeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TRUEMAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray heaven, we may! but, believe me, 'tis hot work. Simple, tho' a mere fool, seems to have plenty of money, which he makes fly, like wild fire, and, gold, Maria, in this, as well as in every other case, is the most prevailing argument a man can use. I could get no admittance any where, without first shewing my ticket. Indeed, Artful's tongue being so well oiled, saves him many a guinea: the women are all in his interest, and then, you know, the men, they follow of course.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>If gaining the favour of the women, Mr. True∣man is necessary, he could not have a better friend, on this occasion than you.</P>

<P>Who is this man, daughter?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>He tells me he belongs to the next parish, mam∣ma, that he is a freeholder, and has influenced several neighbours in favour of Sir Harry.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TRUEM. <HI>in a feigned voice.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>An I had twenty Votes, I'd gee um aal to he; if t'were only on Squoire Wealthy's account.</P>

<P>Faith, leave <HI>him</HI> alone for a scheme! O, he's a charming man!</P>

<P>My good neighbour, I beg your pardon,—I thought it had been some—Indeed, Sir, I thank you, and, when Mr. Wealthy sees you, he shall thank you too. I assure you, Sir Harry is a very <HI>fine</HI> gentleman, and more than that, is determin∣ed, if chose, right or wrong, <HI>always</HI> to vote against the court.
<STAGE>[Aside to Maria]</STAGE> I tell <HI>him</HI> so, you know, tho' that would not be the way to swell our interest, and get a place for your cousin Tom.
<STAGE>[To Trueman.]</STAGE> For the court—Well, go back∣ward friend, into the saloon, (you will see many of your acquaintance there) and get something to refresh you, for you seem almost choaked with dust.</P>

<P>Come, girl, go get your cap on; at present, you are hardly fit to be seen, I expect Sir Har∣ry here shortly. 'Twill be a charming thing, Ma∣ria, if he gets chose for the county, 'twill be the
<PB N="8" REF="8"/>making of us all. Your father shall have a place in the <HI>Chequer,</HI> for he loves to be counting of money; I'll be mistress of the robes, you shall be a woman of the bedchamber, and, as for cousin Tom, he shall be—What shall he be?—No matter, I'll think for <HI>him</HI> by-and-by.</P>

<P>Confound Artful and his party too. Double my numbers, Quirk, and not suffer the scoundrels to enter the town at all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>QUIRK.</SPEAKER>
<P>No;—that won't do;—that won't do; were we to carry it under those circumstances, it would be deemed no election: they'd bring it into the house, and swear their voters could not poll, for fear of their lives.</P>

<P>Well, gentlemen, I shall leave these matters wholly to you; I hope there is not much doubt of success?</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="20" REF="20"/>
<SPEAKER>QUIRK.</SPEAKER>
<P>You must spare no expence; if you do, in my opinion, 'tis over with you. Artful's plea upon all occasions, is, <HI>I'm no Courtier,</HI> tho' 'twas but the other day I saw him following the breech of my Lord M'Sawney, into the great house at the bottom of St. James's Street.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> HARRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>You should tell some devilish lie or another.— Can't you say that I'll get the militia bill and the beer act repealed? or,—tell 'em I'll get an act passed that every man shall be at liberty to leave his wife, at the expiration of three years, if he does not like her, and marry again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CRAFTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha, ha, ha, I don't know what that indeed might do, but as to the militia bill, and the beer act, they'll now go no more down with the peo∣ple, than stale small beer, to a man that is not thirsty.</P>

<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> HARRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have been considering, gentlemen, how much I am obliged to you. What could I have done without you? <HI>Should</HI> I succeed, you shall not find me ungrateful.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>QUIRK.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Should!</HI>—Let us not suppose a doubt.—Money must certainly carry it. The generality of free∣holders, especially the lower sort, would not only sell their country, but, they'd part with their wives and children could they get any thing for 'em.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CRAFTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>The great inconsistency of these people, often makes me smile: they sell themselves, and then wonder, and are displeased at being sold.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> HARRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Fore Gad! that's true enough.
<STAGE>[to Quirk.]</STAGE> How have you done in the lower part of the county?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>QUIRK.</SPEAKER>
<P>Damn the lower part; I found 'em as merce∣nary and venal, as they could well be. Many of them turned up their noses at <HI>five</HI> pieces; I was obliged to give them ten, and, at one place, I was under a necessity of entertaining the girls with the humours of Mr. Punch; <HI>that</HI> cost me fifty; I should have done nothing if I had'nt; for the tongues of the men and women in that place are, like the strings of a fiddle equally tuned, in per∣fect unison. What one cries, the other answers.</P>

<P>Must you! Blessings go with it, then! No∣thing venture they say, nothing have. A day or two now will determine all.

<STAGE>Exit.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>QUIRK.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now we are alone, tell me, Crafty, how you succeeded last week.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CRAFTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll deal frankly with you; for rogues are ge∣nerally honest to one another.—I made a com∣plete thousand.—I got a cool hundred out of one parish.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>QUIRK.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you have done better than I, for what with presents, balls, feasting and puppet-shews, I hav'n't been able to save quite seven hundred; and, when I gave him in the account, he thought I had been too profuse.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CRAFTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Zounds, man, you don't take the right step. Did you make the landlords of public houses your friends? tip them but a piece or two extraordi∣nary, and they'll give you a receipt for double
<PB N="23" REF="23"/>the money you spend. They daren't cry out for fear of betraying themselves.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>QUIRK.</SPEAKER>
<P>All <HI>that</HI> I took care to do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Did you enter in your account, so much to ringers, so much to fidlers, so much to tatlers?</P>

<P>Tatlers? who are they?</P>

<P>Why, the old women.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>QUIRK.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, I never thought of them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CRAFTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not fee the old women! then you hav'n't done either Sir Harry, or yourself, justice.—It would not only have swelled the account, but tip an old woman's tongue with gold, and, she'll talk you off, in such gilded strains, as shall do you more essen∣tial service, than all you give besides. Oh!— the old women, the tatlers as I call them, have a power of talking you black or white, just as dis∣position leads 'em. Whatever you do,—secure the old women.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>QUIRK.</SPEAKER>
<P>Live and learn's an old proverb.—I presume you include the parson, and the apothecary, in the number of the old women.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CRAFTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Doubtless.—They are the belweathers of a parish, they are the main springs that set the fe∣male tongue a-going. Nothing in this point can ever be done, without the parson and the apothe∣cary.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="24" REF="24"/>
<SPEAKER>QUIRK.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis impossible, Simple could have employed a better man in this business than you, Crafty; you seem perfectly acquainted with it, and can fall in with the taste of all ranks of people.—I'll be bold to say, you will eat, drink, lie, swear and whore, with any man in the three kingdoms.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CRAFTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha, ha, ha. Necessity has no law; there's no carrying the point without it. The better we keep up the spirit of the thing, the greater ad∣vantage we shall reap. I'd see Simple at the de∣vil, before I'd take so much pains, if I hadn't a feeling in it. If he is returned, he marries the girl, her fortune is paid, and I hope we shall have some of the fingering it. If not, as we shall have the bonds he has given us ready in force, we'll execute the writs, and secure the mo∣ney, while he has any to pay.

<P>A neighbour passed the door this instant, and told me squire Artful had it five to three.</P>

<SPEAKER><HI>Mrs.</HI> W.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis impossible, varlet.—And, yet I fear there's something in it, as no body's been here.</P>

<P>Oh, 'tis certainly so.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mrs.</HI> W.</SPEAKER>
<P>Maria, is it not very unaccountable that your father should send no kind of word?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps it goes hard against Sir Harry, and my Papa waits till the poll takes a better turn.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mrs.</HI> W.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tell me not of <HI>better</HI> or <HI>worse;</HI> I believe in my heart, if he does not carry it I shall go distracted.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'm sorry, mamma, to see you so much con∣cerned about it; what advantage will it be to you if he is returned?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mrs.</HI> W.</SPEAKER>
<P>How can you ask that nonsensical question?— Will it be no advantage to have the disposal of
<PB N="45" REF="45"/>many places about the Court? Will it be no ad∣vantage to be importuned for our interest? Will it be no advantage to have one's daughter the wife of a member of parliament?—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mamma, you quite astonish me; do you think....</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mrs.</HI> W.</SPEAKER>
<P>If he does not gain it, I'll have nothing to say to him;—you shan't have him, let Mr. Wealthy say what he will.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>With respect to that, you may be perfectly easy; for I would not be the wife of so illiterate a fop, was he possessed of the first seat in the House of Lords.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mrs.</HI> W.</SPEAKER>
<P>You're thinking of that low bred fellow, True∣man, now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Trueman is a gentleman, a man of some honour, and had <HI>he</HI> stood for the county, would have carried it in spite of fate, but Sir Harry is such an ignorant coxcomb, that had he spent ten times the sum he has, I'm persuaded it must have been to little purpose...I fear you have only dis∣graced yourselves in espousing <HI>his</HI> cause.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mrs.</HI> W.</SPEAKER>
<P>Girl cease your impertinence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you and my pappa are determined your son∣in-law shall be a knight of the shire, you need only consent to my marriage with Mr. Trueman, support him as heartily as you have done Sir Har∣ry, and I'll be bound you'll succeed.</P>

<SPEAKER><HI>Mrs.</HI> W.</SPEAKER>
<P>How's that, Maria?</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>listening greedily.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>I say, mamma; as I am an only child, and my pappa does not want for money, let him consent to my marrying Mr. Trueman, put him up for the county the next vacancy; support him as he has done Sir Harry, and there's no doubt he'll carry it; for in his canvass for Mr. Artful, he has won the hearts of all the people.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mrs.</HI> W.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>aside.</STAGE>
<P>She talks a little reasonable.—But it must not be.... Sir Harry cannot lose it... Run to the upper windows, and see if any of our fellows are coming. That wench stays an age, I'll go out into the road myself.</P>

<P>It's from Sir Harry,—there,—he's ruined, and charges me with his undoing; he says, he was obliged to borrow a large sum on account of this election, that he depended on success, and thought to have repaid it, with my daughter's fortune; that he has been betrayed by Quirk and Crafty, that bonds he's given, are put in execution against him, that he has not a farthing left, has therefore gone out of the way, and says nothing can re∣trieve him but an alliance with my family—a mighty pretty scoundrel!—This, wife, is <HI>your</HI> do∣ing.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mrs.</HI> W.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>My</HI> doing, Mr. Wealthy? You know as how we thought he was a man of fortune, or, I never should have consented to his marrying my daugh∣ter.</P>

<P>'Tis well, pappa, 'tis no worse; I am deliver∣ed from a bad husband, and you freed from a wicked villain.</P>

<P>If report speaks true, he's all that's bad. Ma∣ny an honest man in town will be a loser by him; the publican's bills, I fear, will come short of payment.—</P>

<P>'Tis an ill wind that blows no body good.</P>

<SPEAKER><HI>Mr.</HI> W.</SPEAKER>
<P>All the praises of the day, have been in favour of that Trueman; had I stirred as much for him,
<PB N="49" REF="49"/>as I've done for t'other, we should not have set down under this disgrace.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mrs.</HI> W.</SPEAKER>
<P>You may do that next time, for your daugh∣ter's determined to have him, and I'm resolved my son-in-law shall be in parliament.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, pappa, Mr. Trueman is possessed of such good qualities as do honour to the gentle∣man; tho' he is not so rich as some, you are sen∣sible a fortune with us is not so great an object of attention, as honour and honesty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mr.</HI> W.</SPEAKER>
<P>All that without book, huzzy?—</P>

<P>Besides, Sir, my future happiness is wrapt up in <HI>him,</HI> and, I have always had reason to believe you wish for nothing more, than to see your only child settled <HI>happily</HI> in the world.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mrs.</HI> W.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have given <HI>my</HI> consent to the match, ever since I heard of Artful's being returned; and would have <HI>you</HI> do so too; —

<STAGE>throwing off his disguise.</STAGE>
<P>Then, let that day be now.—See, Sir, before you, that Trueman you have been pleased to think so favourably of, and suffer him to say, that if he could obtain your consent

<SP>
<SPEAKER>TRUEM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Meeting with the man appointed to deliver that letter, and desiring to see the object of my love, I procured this upper habit at the expence of a crown, promising to deliver it for him.—He is waiting at the next public house for an answer.</P>

<STAGE>angrily.</STAGE>
<P><HI>We'll</HI> send him an answer, presently.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mr.</HI> W.</SPEAKER>
<P>That man must be an unaccountable being, that does not respect one, of whom the whole country speaks so well. Let us then repair a broken alliance, which must have been dreadful in its consequences, by that of one, which bodes a deal of good. Take my girl
<STAGE>[joining Trueman's and Maria's hand.]</STAGE> with all a father's wishes; make her a good husband, and teach the world, that <HI>honesty is the best policy,</HI> and that 'tis more no∣ble to espouse integrity, than to stand forth in the cause of iniquity.</P>
