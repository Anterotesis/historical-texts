<P>THE LIVERPOOL PRIZE; A FARCE: IN TWO ACTS. AS IT PERFORMED AT THE THEATRE-ROYAL, IN COVENT-GARDEN, WITH UNIVERSAL APPLAUSE. WRITTEN BY F. PILON.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IT having been insinuated, that the Li∣verpool Prize was written in the spirit of party, the author takes this opportunity of publicly declaring, that nothing could be further from his intention than such an idea. If the maritime phrases so often re∣peated on a late public occasion, be deem∣ed satire in disguise, he confesses himself too dull to find it out; it was impossible to avoid using them, in painting a sailor like Teneriffe: but admitting they were selected in consequence of their being temporary, the writer of the Liverpool Prize has done no more in using them, than the best dra∣matic writers have done before him, and, indeed, ought to continue to do, if the stage be the mirror of the times. Distin∣guished
<PB N="iv" REF="3"/>
as Shakespeare was, and above the necessity of stooping to temporary allusions, yet would he sometimes sacrifice to them, in order to gratify the public; a circum∣stance which has contributed not a little to that obscurity in his writings which has so long amused and perplexed the critics. As to the liberty the author took in mention∣ing Admiral Keppel's name, he hopes no man is so great an enemy to his country as to ascribe it to party; it was the tribute of his heart; an echo to the voice of a whole nation, loud in praise of a man who had so often fought the battles of Old England with success, and in whose hands the ho∣nour of the British flag can never tarnish.</P>

<L>THE Liverpool prize! what are these folks still on</L>
<L>The twenty thousand paid Leland and Dillon?</L>
<STAGE>Pausing.</STAGE>
<L>I sold that number, and insured it too,</L>
<L>Aye, prizes out of number, 'tween me and you!</L>
<STAGE>Looking round with surprize.</STAGE>
<L>'Sdeath! where am I? What! stumbled on the stage?</L>
<L>No wonder that, in this satyric age;</L>
<L>Here marksman Wit shoots at all game that flies,</L>
<L>One night a Nabob—next a Molesworth dies.</L>
<L>Why even this I could suppose Guildhall,</L>
<L>But that I miss the wheels, and giants 'gainst the wall,</L>
<STAGE>Looking at the figures of tragedy and Comedy.</STAGE>
<L>Miss the giants! from the earliest age</L>
<L>Those Ladies have stood Gog and Magog of the stage.</L>
<L>Then round in expectation buyers sit,</L>
<L>Before me the Commissioners, in the Pit,</L>
<L>Who meet in judgment on each muse-struck vot'ry,</L>
<L>And on these hustings Genius has its Lott'ry.</L>
<L>All the world's a stage—old Shakespeare declares,</L>
<L>And all the men and women merely play'rs.</L>
<L>Did Shakespeare's genius light the present day,</L>
<L>All the world's a lott'ry, I'm sure, he'd say.</L>
<L>What is the law, but a deep scheme which tries</L>
<L>To pick your pocket of a swinging prize?</L>
<L>Physic's another, of which, friends, beware,</L>
<L>For death and the doctor all the prizes share.</L>
<L>We fix upon a number in a wife,</L>
<L>And without luck we draw—a blank for life;</L>
<L>Unless, indeed, we take the well-bred course,</L>
<L><HI>T insure,</HI> at Doctors Commons, by <HI>divorce.</HI></L>
<L>The state by all's a lott'ry allow'd.</L>
<L>The wheels of state you know—'Sdeath, I'm too loud.</L>
<L>The lott'ry wheels, good folks, I mean to say,</L>
<L>The wheels of state go always the right way.</L>
<L>Yonder's the poet, with a dismal face,</L>
<L>Who would attempt to underwrite his case?</L>
<L>If he thinks I will, our poet here is bit,</L>
<L>I never sign a policy on wit.</L>
<STAGE>Addressing the audience.</STAGE>
<L>Here is the only office can secure him,</L>
<L>If you approve, the town will then insure him.</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>FANNY.</SPEAKER>
<P>AND you really think, Mr. Bronze, that I believe what you tell me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bron.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not I, upon my soul; I only hope you'll make your mistress believe it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why have you no more conscience, sirrah! than to expect I'll tell my mistress lies for you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bron.</SPEAKER>
<P>What else should you tell her, hussy, if you have a mind to keep your place? A fine woman, has nothing but lies told her from morning till night, and expects nothing else from her lover, or her chamber∣maid.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I protest, its enough to corrupt any <HI>vartuous</HI> girl to converse with your London <HI>sarvants.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bron.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, I don't know but you are right, Fanny; especially, if it be a <HI>vartuous</HI> girl like yourself, who has beauty enough to be worth taking pains with—
<PB N="2" REF="7"/>
But tell me, is your mistress drest? How does she look in her uniform?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, she is drest, and if she'd take my advice, she'd undress again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bron.</SPEAKER>
<P>And my master's too; but all in good time, Fanny; I am now come to tell you, to be ready, to let him in, at the back stairs, in about ten minutes; he has a chaise and four ready, and will whisk you and your mistress off, you jade in—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hold, hold, my good friend! won't the wheels of his carriage want a little greasing—When I saw you both in Liverpool last, you were not much encum∣bered with the weight of your purses.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bron.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Sdeath! I had like to have forgot my princi∣pal argument, with a chambermaid.</P>
<STAGE>[Puts his hand in his pocket, and pulls out a guinea.]</STAGE>
<P>Look at this little smiling rogue; we have two hundred of the same pat∣tern; and my master desired I would make a present of this, to his good friend, and my adorable Fanny, as an earnest of future favours.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I protest this is very pretty of him; and I am sure I am glad, that he's taking her off from that great ugly monster, Teneriffe; I have always said, it was a pity, they should not come together. The lieutenant, you know, is her cousin, he loves her; and, I'm sure, there's no love lost, indeed, Mr. Bronze. If you have many such arguments, Bronze, as your last, there will be no resisting you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bron.</SPEAKER>
<P>Many, hussey! my master and I, have an unlimited credit on the bank of Israel.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fan.</SPEAKER>
<P>The bank of Israel! I never heard of such a bank in my life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bron.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is a sign you are a good christian, and never wanted money: Abraham, Jacob, and Co. are the only bankers we can draw upon now: Heaven help us, since I and my master became poor, nobody, but
<PB N="3" REF="8"/>
infidels, will credit us.—But how is old Debenture? Is he screwed up with the rheumatism, or bound hand and foot with the gout?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Neither—He has both hands and feet at liber∣ty, and is now sitting with his constant companion, Captain Teneriffe, over his evening pipe.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bron.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is not that the great sea calf, that is intended for our divine little Harriet?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fan.</SPEAKER>
<P>The very same—Well, I protest, Mr. Bronze, its enough to make one die with laughing, to hear them both talk; they rave of nothing but their privateer from morning till night, and the prizes she's to bring in; the only thing, which troubles me, is Captain Wilmot, that's gone in her.—Oh! the sweet, fellow! He did not leave a dry eye in Liverpool, when he went away. I do believe he might have manned his ship with women, if he had a mind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bron.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well blundered, my sweet little bull-maker—Lord! how a pretty face does sanctify nonsense.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! Mr. Bronze, you are such a wit, there's no such thing as speaking before you, you are so sophi∣stical in your reflections.</P>
<STAGE>[A bell rings.]</STAGE>
<P>Dear me, let me be gone; there's my mistress's bell. Let me go, you devil, or you'll ruin me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bron.</SPEAKER>
<P>What at your years, Fanny?</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Bell again.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pshaw! let me go, I beg of you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bron.</SPEAKER>
<P>But first, take this, and this; <STAGE>[kissing her]</STAGE> these are the only guineas I can give you now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fan.</SPEAKER>
<P>But don't think I take them as sterling cur∣rency?</P>
</SP>

<P>If you did, huffy, I'd impeach you of high treason in the court of love, and have you punished for clipping them.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ten.</SPEAKER>
<P>Like enough.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Deb.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have been thinking, friend Teneriffe, how many prizes she must have taken, in the ten days she has been out. Let me see now—she has been out ten days—The first day, I remember, was as fine a day as ever came out of the heavens—But then she could not have got very near the French coast the first day; and if she took one, it was not bad,—No, no, one was the most she took the first day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mids.</SPEAKER>
<P>Stave in my head rails, how you do talk.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ten.</SPEAKER>
<P>Avast, Midships, don't fire the chase guns too soon, we'll bring him up with a wet sail presently.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Deben.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what a terrible day was the second; the chimney of the Golden Lion was blown down; you may remember the circumstance very well; for we were to have dined there, and our dinner was spoilt by the accident—a fine goose was knockt of the spit by the fall of a brick-bat; a large pot, with a plumb pud∣ding in it, clean overturned; and the cook scalded in so terrible a manner, she was obliged to be sent to the hospital.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ten.</SPEAKER>
<P>If only a dinner was overset, in that day's gale, brother Debenture, we have no right to complain of
<PB N="5" REF="10"/>
the weather—but poor Sally, I hope she rid it out—Every blast went to my heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mids.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what was that gale to the one we had in our last voyage to the coast of Guinea?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ten.</SPEAKER>
<P>Right, Midships, not a capfull—Damme, I had forgot that gale; but do you remember our battle next day with the Spanish frigate?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ten.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do I? We were upon the larboard quar∣ter, as it might be here—so I whips up my helm a weather, shoots under her counter, and we raked her fore and aft, with a whole broadside of round, double, and grape.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Deben.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! now they have got fighting the Spaniards on the coast of Guinea, we shan't have them in the Channel these two hours.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ten.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now, friend Debenture, an account of this battle is worth hearing.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Lays down his pipe.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Deben.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, you know, you have told it to me above twenty times.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ten.</SPEAKER>
<P>Suppose this here bowl now, do you see me, the enemy, and my pipe the Bonny.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mids.</SPEAKER>
<P>You know, your honor, we had got the wea∣ther gage of them—now this here tobacco-pouch.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ten.</SPEAKER>
<P>Avast, you lubber, do you think I want your assistance to fight a ship?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Deben.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wish to the lord, this battle was well over, for it threatens to prove a devilish obstinate one.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ten.</SPEAKER>
<P>The enemy, I say, bore right down upon us, as this here bowl may do, do you see.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Drawing the bowl towards him, spils the liquor.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Deben.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, my good friend, don't overset our punch in the heat of the action, you may chance to need it to recruit your spirits, when the battle is over.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ten.</SPEAKER>
<P>We received two broadsides from her without firing a single shot, till luffing up right under her stern,
<PB N="6" REF="11"/>
as you say, Midships, we raked her fore and aft the first broadside.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mids.</SPEAKER>
<P>Away went her mizen-mast.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ten.</SPEAKER>
<P>Next goes the main-mast by the board.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mids.</SPEAKER>
<P>Grapple, damme, is the word, and pepper them; and in less than a shake of her main top fail, there was not a stick of timber left standing between the poop lanthorn and the bees of her bowsprit.</P>

<P>Zounds! the fight grows devilish hot. I had better get out of the way, or I shall come in for my share of the action.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ten.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now we come close along side, yard arm and yard arm; clear the decks, boys! and Spanish gold was the word. We boarded them with five and twen∣ty choice hands, and before you could upset a serving mallet, we had every Spanish dog upon his beam end, damn me!</P>

<P>How long would we continue fighting?—What a question to ask an Englishman and a sailor!—How long would we continue fighting! Till the blood ran out of our scuppers; till we had not a rag of can∣vass, or a splinter of wood to hang it on; ay, damme, till we had died, and then—why we should have fought like Englishmen.</P>

<P>I say two; one of 'em (as hearty a piece of oak as ever was stumped upon) I lent to a brother sea∣man, and it was burnt in the fire at Greenwich-Ho∣spital; and the other was disabled by a two and for∣ty pounder, in the last war, with as brave a fellow as ever pricked for his beef—<HI>Commodore Keppel.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>Deben.</SPEAKER>
<P>But hark'ee, neighbour Teneriff, suppose whilst you are fighting this Spanish frigate, a pirate should take possession of your best prize—Have you forgot Harriet? Did not I tell you, that my graceless nephew George Belford it stationed here; I wish from my heart, he had been sent to fight the French; that fellow it as dangerous amongst women as a kite in a hen-roost, and will snap her up in spite of us, if we have not our eyes about us.</P>

<P>You shall marry her to-morrow, neighbour Teneriffe, for that rascal will stick at nothing to get her; he'd hang his uncle for her sake, ay, his father, if he's not hang'd already, for, heaven be praised, he has not been heard of these eighteen years; when he married my poor sister, he was as wild and extrava∣gant as that fellow now is.</P>

<P>I did try, your worship; but, ecod, there was so many of them, I was always out before I had done counting: but every body said there was not less than four French East-Indiamen, a Spanish galleon, laden with dollars, and a snow from Bourdeaux, full of ex∣cellent claret.</P>

<P>I am deaf; I don't hear a word you say. I won't believe a word you say, for I'm determined to have the four East-Indiamen, the galleon, and the Bourdeaux-man, in spite of you, and our enemies to∣gether.

from Bonrdeaux! Why, zounds, Sir, do you think we had a squadron of first rates with us?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Deben.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, I confess, it was a very great capture: but, perhaps, we have been misinformed, as to the galleon; however, I am certain there can be no mi∣stake as to the four East-Indiamen and the Bourdeaux-man—then I have as good as promised a tun of the claret to an acquaintance, and sure you would not have me worse than my word.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Breeze.</SPEAKER>
<P>Unship my binnacle, I don't know what you'd be at.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ten.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, damme, he'd have you take the whole French navy in a cockle shell.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Breeze.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your honour, it would be a damn'd hard thing to do that; but if I had room to work my guns in one, I'd engage to fight them till they either beat or sunk me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ten.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well said, my heart of oak! But what prizes have you taken?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Breeze.</SPEAKER>
<P>The third day we were out, we took a Bour∣deaux-man, laden with claret, and sent her into Wa∣terford in Ireland.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Deben.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am very glad of that. Go on, my friend, go on, don't be tedious.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Breeze.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yesterday morning, we fell in with this here Indiaman, now coming into the harbour, which Captain Wilmot, and every hand aboard, says, is worth half a million.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ten.</SPEAKER>
<P>It she's worth half that, Breeze, she's a noble prize. Now, my old boy, what do you say? Sure you are not dissatisfied, though you have got but the one Indiaman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Deben.</SPEAKER>
<P>But how did the other three escape, Breeze? Did'nt you meet eyer a galleon in your way?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Breeze.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why you know, master, we have no right
<PB N="11" REF="16"/>
to meddle with a galleon, the Spaniards and we are very good friends.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Deben.</SPEAKER>
<P>I had forgot that—but I wish you had snap∣ped her up for all that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ten.</SPEAKER>
<P>What not content yet? Damme, you're a true Nabob, all the riches of the east would not satisfy you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Breeze.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I have a another message for you, Sir. There are some great folks taken a-board the French∣man, which Captain Wilmot desires you'll provide lodgings for.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Deben.</SPEAKER>
<P>They shall lodge at my own house till they are better provided for. But tell me their names and quality, that I may know how to conduct myself, and make suitable preparations.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Breeze.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, in the first place, there's a Dutch merchant, who has sent a power of money over to Europe; he must have a good birth, for Captain Wil∣mot is very fond of him, I suppose, because he speaks English.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Deben.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll take care of him, he shall have the best bed in my house.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Breeze.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then there's a French general and his cop∣per coloured wife.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Deben.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, zounds! I'll get them private lodgings. Any more?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Breeze.</SPEAKER>
<P>These are all he spoke to me about.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Deben.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray what is the Dutch merchant and the French general's names?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Breeze.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Dutch merchan's name I have forgot; but the French general's name is Moonsheer Coro∣mandel.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Deben.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon my word, it has a fine rumbling ge∣neral-like found. But harkee, Breeze, go you in and get some refreshment. Here, Jonathan!</P>

<HI>Enter</HI> Jonathan.</STAGE>
<P>Here, take this honest fellow; give him whatever he pleases to eat and drink.</P>

</SP>

<P>Now suppose you were to step into Harriet's apartment, and under pretence of shewing your gal∣lantry, watch that she receives or sends no letters from or to that dog Belford.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ten.</SPEAKER>
<P>With all my heart; I'll e'en finish my pipe with her.</P>

<P>Zounds, man! don't take your pipe with you; women hate the smell of tobacco worse than a water-side warehouse.</P>

Is there nothing strikes you, ha! in this martial air, this quarter-deck strut, or the easy dangle of this well-hung sword? Oh, heavens! if I were a man, and had my mistress in the same situation you now have, I'd have something to say to every part about her, even her cockade should not escape me; I'd tell her, that engineer Cupid had lain perdu in that little ambush of black ribband, in order to level the artillery of her eyes with more certain aim against her sighing admirer.</P>

<P>Yes, Sir, and they took an old Dutch gentle∣man, who knows your father, Sir, and says, that he's

<P>Ay, Sir, at his old tricks; some game has started; and as he knows you, Captain, to be a keen sportsman, he thinks he may break an appointment with you, on certain occasions. 'Sdeath, Sir, don't you know him of old; no magnet ever misled steel, as a petticoat will my master—But, lord Sir, what need I say any thing to you, who, from your own expe∣perience, must have such a fellow feeling for him?</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>O. Belf.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sorry, Captain Wilmot, to hear this man speak thus of my friend's son; you taught me to believe, that he was prudent and sober, free from the vices, which in general taint youth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bron.</SPEAKER>
<P>Prudent and sober! and so he is, Sir; as prudent and sober as any young gentleman in Eng∣land: but you judge of him, Mynheer, by the stan∣dard of Dutch constitution; in which all the philoso∣phers agree, that the blood freezes before twenty.</P>

<P>Do, I beseech you, Sir, for I have got such a damn'd habit of lying and slandering, by living in great families, that I can't give a good character of anybody.—Sober and prudent did I say! my master's as regular as a time-piece, never out of order, unless when he threshes me; his pulse does not quicken two strokes in a month; his blood is all iced cream; no∣thing warm about him except his heart; and that, Sir, I assure you, is every fibre English.</P>

<P>I can't tell you, friend; however, this much I can tell you, that you have no reason to desire his arrival; for whenever he comes, he'll make your ma∣ster part with you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bron.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lord, Sir! what unforgiving tempers you Dutch gentlemen have! Why, Sir, nobody minds what I say. I am so poor, Sir, that they call me a wit, and by that charter, I speak ill of every body.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wilm.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall go this moment, George, to my un∣cle's, and if I find argument to be lost on him, will assist you in getting Harriet away; thanks to fortune, my friend, I am rich enough to make us both happy.</P>

one though, for I'll be hanged, Bronze, if thou couldst ever play Diogenes from an empty one. Well then, to a full cask will I retire; and since I can't rail the world into gratitude, like a wiser philosopher than Diogenes was, I'll drink myself into patience.</P>

<P>Oh! Sir, I understand that you know Mr. Belford's father; that you had a friendship for him; how then can you be the instrument of making your friend's son miserable?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, Madam! are you so strongly attached to this young Belford?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Attached, Sir! his happiness and mine are in∣separably united; I live only in the expectation of being his.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then, Madam, I can hardly suppose, he de∣serves a bad character.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>A bad character! The breath of malice could never glance upon his reputation. The amiable∣ness of his manner, the sweetness of his temper, have gained him the affection of every body, except my unrelenting father.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must believe you, for your words give me rapture.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why can you receive pleasure from the praises of a rival?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>A rival! he's my son, and can you wonder at my transports?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Am I awake!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear girl, conceal your emotion as much as possible, and appear resigned to comply with your father's request; I have not yet discovered myself to George, but promised to intercede for him. I'll put him a little to the rack, to render his pleasure after∣wards the more, exquisite.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>O. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>What can be the meaning of this confusion?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wilm.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mynheer Van Slopen, do you not know that Adelaide is the legal wife of Coromandel?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>I heard as much in India—I can even go so far at to declare she was publicly received as his wife.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Adel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Me vas, indeed! My father gave him two grands diamants for my fortune.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wilm.</SPEAKER>
<P>Two great diamonds for your fortune! and what's become of them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Adel.</SPEAKER>
<P>He has dem here <STAGE>[Points to her breast.]</STAGE> in his best of coat.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Deben.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pho, pho, pho. Do you mind what she says, after the falshood she has told you? He got diamonds concealed! not he, poor fellow. I look upon the General to be a very honest man, one that would not wrong us of a sixpence.</P>
<STAGE>[Aside.]</STAGE>
<P>It would be the very devil, if the diamonds should be dis∣covered.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wilm.</SPEAKER>
<P>As for your part, Mr. Debenture, I am astonished at you, how could you think of giving your daughter to a man, who has a wife already?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Deben.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why now! here it is. Why that circum∣stance alone might convince you. Did not I tell you before, that this was all an invention of this woman's, (the mere effect of jealousy, I suppose) just of a piece with the tale of the diamonds—But ask Mynheer, he can acquit me of this charge.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think, Captain Wilmot, I can assure you, that Mr. Debenture, has other views for his daughter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Deben.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay; other views, for my daughter! Zounds, do you think I'd give her to a copper-coloured rascal,
<PB N="34" REF="39"/>
upon half an hour's acquaintance—A fellow sprung from the lord knows who! and come from the lord knows where!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wilm.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly, this is most extraordinary.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Deben.</SPEAKER>
<P>I never met with any thing so extraordinary in the course of my life. But harkee, Wilmot, is she accustomed to drink? she does not appear to me to be perfectly sober.</P>

<P>Then, Mr. Debenture, will you accompany me so far? Your interest, as well at mine, is con∣cerned.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>You know, Wilmot, I was a stranger to your character. I had determined to conceal myself from every body, in order to come with more ease and certainty at a knowledge of my son's disposition; and had he not proved what I wished and what I find him, I would have buried myself in some obscure re∣treat, and conceal'd my chagrin and disappointment for ever.</P>
