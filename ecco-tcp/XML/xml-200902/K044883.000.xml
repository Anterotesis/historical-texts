<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE Thirteenth Satire of Juvenal has been al∣ways admired by the ablest judges, not merely for its elegance and poetical spirit, but as a sublime com∣position, containing the purest and most useful moral doctrine, such as goes home to the breast and busi∣ness of every man in society. The Author launches out, with his usual indignation, against the reigning vices of the times, and particularly FRAUD and PER∣JURY. He introduces his subject with an apparent intention to console a friend, who had deposited a sum of money in the hands of a man base enough to deny the trust, and support his fraud by a daring Perjury.</P>
<P><PB N="viii" REF="5"/>
He observes, in the outset, that the guilty are ne∣ver at peace; they have no rest from their own relentless thoughts; and yet deceit, and treachery, and injustice prevail in the mass of human life. He paints forth the vices of mankind in glaring colours; and, having by way of contrast mentioned the times of innocence (commonly called the Golden Age), he takes occasion to place in a ridiculous light the whole system of the Heathen Mythology. The wit and pleasantry, with which this part of the poem is exe∣cuted, are truly beautiful: but there is reason to fear that the whole passage would now be thought an unseasonable digression; and, for that reason, it was judged advisable, in the English Poem, to sub∣stitute ideas drawn from modern manners.</P>
<P>Juvenal proceeds to observe the intrepidity with which perjury is often committed. The fear of de∣tection
<PB N="ix" REF="6"/>by human evidence, he says, is the only re∣straint: secure from that danger, the offender is ready, as Shakespeare has it, <HI>to jump the life to come.</HI> Of this depravity two causes are assigned: in the first place, Atheism; and secondly, even among believers, the delusive hope of escaping punishment, or of ex∣piating the sin by repentance at a future day. The Poet, after this, exhibits a black list of crimes; and, in such a general corruption of manners, exhorts his friend to appease resentment in his own particular case. Revenge, he says, is a little passion. He recurs to his first proposition, namely, that the Perjurer, even though he may elude the hand of justice, is sure to suffer the self-condemning award of his own conscience. He describes in bold relief the horrors of a guilty mind. He traces the progress of vice, beginning with a petty fraud, and rushing on, with apparent success, till at length some foul enormity
<PB N="x" REF="7"/>calls down the sentence of the law, and gives full proof to the world that a superintending Providence watches over the deeds of men, and finally overtakes the offender with slow, but certain vengeance.</P>
<P>Such is the moral that inspires and animates the whole of Juvenal's admirable performance. It may be called A POETICAL STATUTE OF FRAUDS AND PERJURIES. A composition so truly valuable ought not to remain in the hands of the scholar only, like a sword in the scabbard, as Tully has it, <HI>tamquam in vaginâ reconditum.</HI> The doctrine should be im∣pressed on every mind. For this purpose, the mode of imitation was thought more eligible than a direct and close translation. Mr. Pope had led the way, and the late Doctor Johnson followed him with dis∣tinguished applause. The fine use which he made of the Third and Tenth Satires of Juvenal, in LONDON,
<PB N="xi" REF="8"/>a Poem, and THE VANITY OF HUMAN WISHES, is well known to every reader of taste. In fact, those two pieces are finished with such vigour of sentiment, and such strength and harmony of language, as may well preclude in the present writer all hope of com∣petition. It is to be regretted that so fine a Moral Poet did not employ a portion of his time upon the Satire now before us. The author of the following lines endeavoured, at various times, to excite him to the undertaking; but the answer always was, "I WISH IT WAS DONE." The reader will, no doubt, wish the same, and by the pen of DOCTOR JOHN∣SON. To supply the deficiency is the design of the piece now offered to the public. It is, at least, a well intended attempt, and requires no apology.</P>
