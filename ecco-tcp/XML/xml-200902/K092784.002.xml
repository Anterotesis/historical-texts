<L>POPE, to whose reed beneath the beechen shade,</L>
<L>The nymphs of Thames a pleas'd attention paid;</L>
<L>While yet thy muse; content with humbler praise,</L>
<L>Warbled in Windsor's grove her sylvan lays;</L>
<L>Though now sublimely borne on Homer's wing,</L>
<L>Of glorious wars, and godlike cheifs she sing:</L>
<L>Wilt thou with me re-visit once again</L>
<L>The crystal fountain, and the flow'ry plain?</L>
<L>Wilt thou, indulgent, hear my verse relate</L>
<L>The various changes of a lover's state;</L>
<L>And while each turn of passion I pursue,</L>
<L>Ask thy own heart if what I tell be true?</L>
</LG>

<PB N="4" REF="5"/>
<L>To the green margin of a lonely wood,</L>
<L>Whose pendant shades o'erlook'd a silver flood,</L>
<L>Young Damon came, unknowing where he stray'd,</L>
<L>Full of the image of his beauteous maid:</L>
<L>His flock far off, unfed, untended lay,</L>
<L>To every savage a defenceless prey;</L>
<L>No sense of int'rest cou'd their master move,</L>
<L>And every care seem'd trifling now but Love.</L>
<L>A while in pensive silence he remain'd,</L>
<L>But tho' his voice was mute, his looks complain'd;</L>
<L>At length the thoughts within his bosom pent,</L>
<L>Forc'd his unwilling tongue to give them vent.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ye Nymphs, he cry'd, ye Dryads, who so long</L>
<L>Have favour'd Damon, and inspir'd his song;</L>
<L>For whom, retir'd, I shun the gay resorts</L>
<L>Of sportful cities, and of pompous courts;</L>
<L>In vain I bid the restless world adieu,</L>
<L>To seek tranquillity and peace with you.</L>
<L>Tho' wild Ambition, and destructive Rage</L>
<L>No Factions here can form, no Wars can wage:</L>
<L>Tho' Envy frowns not on your humble shades,</L>
<L>Nor Calumny your innocence invades,</L>
<L>Yet cruel Love, that troubler of the breast,</L>
<L>Too often violates your boasted rest;</L>
<L>With inbred storms disturbs your calm retreat,</L>
<L>And taints with bitterness each rural sweet.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ah luckless day! when first with fond surprize</L>
<L>On Delia's face I fix'd my eager eyes;</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="6"/>
Then in wild tumults all my soul was tost,</L>
<L>Then reason, liberty, at once were lost:</L>
<L>And every wish, and thought, and care was gone,</L>
<L>But what my heart employ'd on her alone.</L>
<L>Then too she smil'd: Can smiles our peace destroy,</L>
<L>Those lovely children of Content and Joy?</L>
<L>How can soft pleasure and tormenting woe,</L>
<L>From the same spring at the same moment flow?</L>
<L>Unhappy boy, these vain enquiries cease,</L>
<L>Thought cou'd not guard, nor will restore thy peace:</L>
<L>Indulge the frenzy that thou must endure,</L>
<L>And sooth the pain thou know'st not how to cure.</L>
<L>Come, flatt'ring Memory, and tell my heart</L>
<L>How kind she was, and with what pleasing art</L>
<L>She strove its fondest wishes to obtain,</L>
<L>Confirm her pow'r, and faster bind my chain.</L>
<L>If on the green we danc'd a mirthful band,</L>
<L>To me alone she gave her willing hand;</L>
<L>Her partial taste, if e'er I touch'd the lyre,</L>
<L>Still in my song found something to admire.</L>
<L>By none but her my crook with flow'rs was crown'd,</L>
<L>By none but her my brows with ivy bound:</L>
<L>The world that Damon was her choice believ'd,</L>
<L>The world, alas! like Damon, was deceiv'd.</L>
<L>When last I saw her, and declar'd my fire</L>
<L>In words as soft as passion cou'd inspire,</L>
<L>Coldly she hear'd, and full of scorn withdrew,</L>
<L>Without one pitying glance, one sweet adieu.</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="7"/>
The frighted hind, who sees his ripen'd corn</L>
<L>Up from the roots by sudden tempests torn,</L>
<L>Whose fairest hopes destroy'd and blasted lie,</L>
<L>Feels not so keen a pang of grief as I.</L>
<L>Ah, how have I deserv'd, inhuman maid,</L>
<L>To have my faithful service thus repay'd?</L>
<L>Were all the marks of kindness I receiv'd,</L>
<L>But dreams of joy, that charm'd me and deceiv'd?</L>
<L>Or did you only nurse my growing love,</L>
<L>That with more pain I might your hatred prove?</L>
<L>Sure guilty treachery no place cou'd find</L>
<L>In such a gentle, such a gen'rous mind:</L>
<L>A maid brought up the woods and wilds among,</L>
<L>Cou'd ne'er have learnt the art of courts so young:</L>
<L>No; let me rather think her anger feign'd,</L>
<L>Still let me hope my Delia may be gain'd;</L>
<L>'Twas only modesty that seem'd disdain,</L>
<L>And her heart suffer'd when she gave me pain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Pleas'd with this flatt'ring thought, the love-sick boy</L>
<L>Felt the faint dawning of a doubtful joy;</L>
<L>Back to his flock more chearful he return'd.</L>
<L>When now the setting sun less fiercely burn'd,</L>
<L>Blue vapours rose along the mazy rills,</L>
<L>And light's last blushes ting'd the distant hills.</L>

<HEAD>HOPE. ECLOGUE II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">To Mr. DODDINGTON.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>HEar, DODDINGTON, the notes that shepherds sing,</L>
<L>Notes soft as those of nightingales in spring:</L>
<L>Nor Pan, nor Phoebus tune the shepherd's reed;</L>
<L>From Love alone our tender lays proceed;</L>
<L>Love warms our fancy with enliv'ning fires,</L>
<L>Refines our genius, and our verse inspires:</L>
<L>From him Theocritus, on Enna's plains,</L>
<L>Learnt the wild sweetness of his Doric strains;</L>
<L>Virgil by him was taught the moving art,</L>
<L>That charm'd each ear, and soften'd every heart:</L>
<L>O wouldst thou quit the pride of courts, and deign</L>
<L>To dwell with us upon the vocal plain,</L>
<L>Thee too his pow'r should reach, and ev'ry shade</L>
<L>Resound the praises of thy fav'rite maid;</L>
<L>Thy pipe our rural concert wou'd improve,</L>
<L>And we shou'd learn of thee to please and love.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Damon no longer sought the silent shade,</L>
<L>No more in unfrequented paths he stray'd,</L>
<L>But call'd the nymphs to hear his jocund song,</L>
<L>And told his joy to all the rustick throng.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="8" REF="9"/>
<L>Blest be the hour, he said, that happy hour,</L>
<L>When first I own'd my Delia's gentle pow'r;</L>
<L>Then gloomy discontent and pining care</L>
<L>Forsook my breast, and left soft wishes there:</L>
<L>Soft wishes there they left, and gay desires,</L>
<L>Delightful languors, and transporting fires.</L>
<L>Where yonder limes combine to form a shade,</L>
<L>These eyes first gaz'd upon the charming maid;</L>
<L>There she appear'd, on that auspicious day,</L>
<L>When swains their sportive rites to Bacchus pay:</L>
<L>She led the danceâ€”heav'ns! with what grace she mov'd!</L>
<L>Who cou'd have seen her then, and not have lov'd?</L>
<L>I strove not to resist so sweet a flame,</L>
<L>But glory'd in a happy captive's name;</L>
<L>Nor wou'd I now, cou'd Love permit, be free,</L>
<L>But leave to brutes their savage liberty.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And art thou then, fond swain, secure of joy?</L>
<L>Can no reverse thy flatt'ring bliss destroy?</L>
<L>Has treacherous Love no torment yet in store?</L>
<L>Or hast thou never prov'd his fatal pow'r?</L>
<L>Whence flow'd those tears that late bedew'd thy cheek?</L>
<L>Why sigh'd thy heart as if it strove to break?</L>
<L>Why were the desart rocks invok'd to hear</L>
<L>The plaintive accent of thy sad despair?</L>
<L>From Delia's rigour all those pains arose,</L>
<L>Delia, who now compassionates my woes,</L>
<L>Who bids me Hope; and in that charming word</L>
<L>Has peace and transport to my soul restor'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="9" REF="10"/>
<L>Begin, my pipe, begin the gladsome lay;</L>
<L>A kiss from Delia shall thy musick pay;</L>
<L>A kiss obtain'd 'twixt struggling and consent,</L>
<L>Giv'n with forc'd anger, and disguis'd content:</L>
<L>No laureat wreaths I ask to bind my brows,</L>
<L>Such as the muse on lofty bards bestows;</L>
<L>Let other swains to praise or fame aspire:</L>
<L>I from her lips my recompence require.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Hark how the bees with murmurs fill the plain,</L>
<L>While ev'ry flower of every sweet they drain:</L>
<L>See, how beneath you hillock's shady steep,</L>
<L>The shelter'd herds on flow'ry couches sleep:</L>
<L>Nor bees, nor herds, are half so blest as I,</L>
<L>If with my fond desires my Love comply;</L>
<L>From Delia's lips a sweeter honey flows,</L>
<L>And on her bosom dwells more soft repose.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ah how, my dear, shall I deserve thy charms?</L>
<L>What gift can bribe thee to my longing arms?</L>
<L>A bird for thee in silken bands I hold,</L>
<L>Whose yellow plumage shines like polish'd gold;</L>
<L>From distant isles the lovely stranger came,</L>
<L>And bears the fortunate Canaries name;</L>
<L>In all our woods none boasts so sweet a note,</L>
<L>Not ev'n the nightingale's melodious throat.</L>
<L>Accept of this; and cou'd I add beside,</L>
<L>What wealth the rich Peruvian mountains hide;</L>
<L>If all the gems in Eastern rocks were mine,</L>
<L>On thee alone their glitt'ring pride shou'd shine.</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="11"/>
But if thy mind no gifts have pow'r to move,</L>
<L>Phoebus himself shall leave th' Aonian grove;</L>
<L>The tuneful Nine, who never sue in vain,</L>
<L>Shall come sweet suppliants for their fav'rite swain.</L>
<L>For him each blue-ey'd Naiad of the flood,</L>
<L>For him each green-hair'd sister of the wood,</L>
<L>Whom oft beneath fair Cynthia's gentle ray</L>
<L>His musick calls to dance the night away.</L>
<L>And you, fair nymphs, companions of my love,</L>
<L>With whom she joys the cowslip meads to rove,</L>
<L>I beg you recommend my faithful flame,</L>
<L>And let her often hear her shepherd's name:</L>
<L>Shade all my faults from her enquiring sight,</L>
<L>And shew my merits in the fairest light;</L>
<L>My pipe your kind assistance shall repay,</L>
<L>And every friend shall claim a diff'rent lay.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But see! in yonder glade the heav'nly fair</L>
<L>Enjoys the fragrance of the breezy airâ€”</L>
<L>Ah, thither let me fly with eager feet;</L>
<L>Adieu, my pipe, I go my love to meetâ€”</L>
<L>O may I find her as we parted last,</L>
<L>And may each future hour be like the past!</L>
<L>So shall the whitest lamb these pastures feed,</L>
<L>Propitious Venus, on thy altars bleed.</L>

<HEAD>JEALOUSY. ECLOGUE III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">To Mr. EDWARD WALPOLE.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>THE gods, O WALPOLE, give no bliss sincere;</L>
<L>Wealth is disturb'd by care, and pow'r by fear,</L>
<L>Of all the passions that employ the mind,</L>
<L>In gentle Love the sweetest joys we find;</L>
<L>Yet ev'n those joys dire Jealousy molests,</L>
<L>And blackens each fair image in our breasts.</L>
<L>O may the warmth of thy too tender heart</L>
<L>Ne'er feel the sharpness of his venom'd dart;</L>
<L>For thy own quiet think thy mistress just,</L>
<L>And wisely take thy happiness on trust.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Begin, my muse, and Damon's woes rehearse,</L>
<L>In wildest numbers and disorder'd verse.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>On a romantick mountain's airy head</L>
<L>(While browzing goats at ease around him fed)</L>
<L>Anxious he lay, with jealous cares oppress'd;</L>
<L>Distrust and anger lab'ring in his breastâ€”</L>
<L>The vale beneath, a pleasing prospect yields,</L>
<L>Of verdant meads and cultivated fields;</L>
<L>Through these a river rolls its winding flood,</L>
<L>Adorn'd with various tufts of rising wood;</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="13"/>
Here half conceal'd in trees a cottage stands,</L>
<L>A castle there the opening plain commands,</L>
<L>Beyond, a town with glitt'ring spires is crown'd,</L>
<L>And distant hills the wide horizon bound:</L>
<L>So charming was the scene, a while the swain</L>
<L>Beheld delighted, and forgot his pain;</L>
<L>But soon the stings infix'd within his heart,</L>
<L>With cruel force renew'd their raging smart:</L>
<L>His flow'ry wreath, which long with pride he wore,</L>
<L>The gift of Delia, from his brows he tore,</L>
<L>Then cry'd; May all thy charms, ungrateful maid,</L>
<L>Like these neglected roses droop and fade;</L>
<L>May angry heav'n deform each guilty grace,</L>
<L>That triumphs now in that deluding face;</L>
<L>Those alter'd looks may every shepherd fly,</L>
<L>And ev'n thy Daphnis hate thee worse than I.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Say, thou inconstant, what has Damon done,</L>
<L>To lose the heart his tedious pains had won?</L>
<L>Tell me what charms you in my rival find,</L>
<L>Against whose pow'r no ties have strength to bind?</L>
<L>Has he, like me, with long obedience strove</L>
<L>To conquer your disdain, and merit love?</L>
<L>Has he with transport every smile ador'd,</L>
<L>And dy'd with grief at each ungentle word?</L>
<L>Ah no! the conquest was obtain'd with ease;</L>
<L>He pleas'd you, by not studying to please:</L>
<L>His careless indolence your pride alarm'd;</L>
<L>And had he lov'd you more, he less had charm'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="13" REF="14"/>
<L>O pain to think, another shall possess</L>
<L>Those balmy lips which I was wont to press:</L>
<L>Another on her panting breast shall lie,</L>
<L>And catch sweet madness from her swimming eye!â€”</L>
<L>I saw their friendly flocks together feed,</L>
<L>I saw them hand in hand walk o'er the mead:</L>
<L>Wou'd my clos'd eyes had sunk in endless night,</L>
<L>Ere I was doom'd to bear that hateful sight!</L>
<L>Where e'er they pass'd, be blasted every flow'r,</L>
<L>And hungry wolves their helpless flocks devour.â€”</L>
<L>Ah wretched swain, cou'd no examples move</L>
<L>Thy heedless heart to shun the rage of Love?</L>
<L>Hast thou not hear'd how poor <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Mr. <HI>Gay's</HI> Dione.</NOTE> Menalcas dy'd</L>
<L>A victim to Parthenia's fatal pride?</L>
<L>Dear was the youth to all the tuneful plain,</L>
<L>Lov'd by the nymphs, by Phoebus lov'd in vain:</L>
<L>Around his tomb their tears the muses paid,</L>
<L>And all things mourn'd but the relentless maid.</L>
<L>Wou'd I cou'd die like him and be at peace;</L>
<L>These torments in the quiet grave wou'd cease,</L>
<L>There my vex'd thoughts a calm repose wou'd find,</L>
<L>And rest as if my Delia still were kind.</L>
<L>No, let me live her falsehood to upbraid:</L>
<L>Some god perhaps my just revenge will aid.â€”</L>
<L>Alas what aid, fond swain, wou'dst thou receive?</L>
<L>Cou'd thy heart bear to see its Delia grieve?</L>
<L><PB N="14" REF="15"/>
Protect her, heav'n, and let her never know</L>
<L>The slightest part of hapless Damon's woe:</L>
<L>I ask no vengeance from the pow'rs above;</L>
<L>All I implore is never more to loveâ€”</L>
<L>Let me this fondness from my bosom tear,</L>
<L>Let me forget that e'er I thought her fair.</L>
<L>Come, cool indifference, and heal my breast;</L>
<L>Wearied, at length I seek thy downy rest:</L>
<L>No turbulence of passion shall destroy</L>
<L>My future ease with flatt'ring hopes of joy,</L>
<L>Hear, mighty Pan, and all ye Sylvans hear,</L>
<L>What by your Guardian deities I swear;</L>
<L>No more my eyes shall view her fatal charms,</L>
<L>No more I'll court the trait'ress to my arms;</L>
<L>Not all her arts my steddy soul shall move,</L>
<L>And she shall find that Reason conquers Loveâ€”</L>

<L>Scarce had he spoke, when through the lawn below</L>
<L>Alone he saw the beauteous Delia go;</L>
<L>At once transported, he forgot his vow,</L>
<L>(Such perjuries the laughing gods allow)</L>
<L>Down the steep hills with ardent haste he flew;</L>
<L>He found her kind, and soon believ'd her true.</L>

<L>COBHAM, to thee this rural lay I bring,</L>
<L>Whose guiding judgment gives me skill to sing;</L>
<L>Though far unequal to those polish'd strains,</L>
<L>With which thy Congreve charm'd the list'ning plains,</L>
<L>Yet shall its musick please thy partial ear,</L>
<L>And sooth thy breast with thoughts that once were dear;</L>

<L>Fancy again shall run past pleasures o'er,</L>

<LG>
<L>Beneath the covert of a myrtle wood,</L>
<L>To Venus rais'd a rustick altar stood,</L>
<L>To Venus and to Hymen, there combin'd,</L>
<L>In friendly league to favour humankind.</L>
<L>With wanton Cupids in that happy shade,</L>

<L>Nor there in sprightly Pleasure's genial train,</L>

Nor Force, nor Interest join'd unwilling hands,</L>

<L>Thither with glad devotion Damon came,</L>

<L>Two milk-white doves he on their altar laid,</L>
<L>And thus to both his grateful homage paid:</L>
<L>Hail bounteous god, before whose hallow'd shrine</L>
<L>My Delia vow'd to be for ever mine,</L>
<L>While glowing in her cheeks, with tender love,</L>
<L>Sweet virgin modesty reluctant strove:</L>
<L>And hail to thee, fair queen of young desires:</L>
<L>Long shall my heart preserve thy pleasing fires,</L>

<L>O the dear gloom of last propitious night!</L>

<L>Then first the sweet excess of bliss I prov'd,</L>
<L>Which none can taste but who like me have lov'd.</L>
<L>Thou too, bright goddess, once in Ida's grove,</L>

<HEAD>ADVICE to a LADY.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>[By the Same. 1731.]</BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>THE counsels of a friend, Belinda, hear,</L>
<L>Too roughly kind to please a Lady's ear,</L>
<L>Unlike the flatteries of a lover's pen,</L>
<L>Such truths as women seldom learn from men.</L>
<L>Nor think I praise you ill, when thus I shew</L>
<L>What female Vanity might fear to know:</L>
<L>Some merit's mine, to dare to be sincere,</L>
<L>But greater your's, sincerity to bear.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Hard is the fortune that your sex attends;</L>
<L>Women, like Princes, find few real friends:</L>
<L>All who approach them their own ends pursue:</L>
<L>Lovers and Ministers are seldom true.</L>
<L><PB N="44" REF="45"/>
Hence oft from Reason heedless Beauty strays,</L>
<L>And the most trusted Guide the most betrays:</L>
<L>Hence by fond dreams of fancy'd Pow'r amus'd,</L>
<L>When most you tyrannize you're most abus'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What is your sex's earliest, latest care,</L>
<L>Your heart's supreme ambition? To be fair:</L>
<L>For this the toilet every thought employs,</L>
<L>Hence all the toils of dress, and all the joys:</L>
<L>For this, hands, lips, and eyes are put to school,</L>
<L>And each instructed feature has its rule:</L>
<L>And yet how few have learnt, when this is giv'n,</L>
<L>Not to disgrace the partial boon of heav'n?</L>
<L>How few with all their pride of form can Move?</L>
<L>How few are lovely, that were made for love?</L>
<L>Do you, my fair, endeavour to possess</L>
<L>An elegance of mind as well as dress;</L>
<L>Be that your ornament, and know to please</L>
<L>By graceful nature's unaffected ease.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nor make to dangerous Wit a vain pretence,</L>
<L>But wisely rest content with modest Sense;</L>
<L>For Wit, like wine, intoxicates the brain,</L>
<L>Too strong for feeble woman to sustain;</L>
<L>Of those who claim it, more than half have none,</L>
<L>And half of those who have it, are undone.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Be still superior to your sex's arts,</L>
<L>Nor think Dishonesty a proof of Parts;</L>
<L>For you the plainest is the wisest rule,</L>
<L>A CUNNING WOMAN is a KNAVISH FOOL.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="45" REF="46"/>
<L>Be good yourself, nor think another's shame</L>
<L>Can raise your merit, or adorn your fame.</L>
<L>Prudes rail at whores, as statesmen in disgrace</L>
<L>At Ministers, because they wish their place.</L>
<L>Virtue is amiable, mild, serene,</L>
<L>Without, all beauty, and all peace within:</L>
<L>The honour of a prude is rage and storm,</L>
<L>'Tis ugliness in its most frightful form:</L>
<L>Fiercely it stands defying gods and men,</L>
<L>As fiery monsters guard a giant's den.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Seek to be good, but aim not to be great:</L>
<L>A woman's noblest station is Retreat;</L>
<L>Her fairest virtues fly from publick sight,</L>
<L>Domestick worth, that shuns too strong a light.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To rougher man Ambition's task resign:</L>
<L>'Tis ours in Senates or in Courts to shine,</L>
<L>To labour for a sunk corrupted state,</L>
<L>Or dare the rage of envy, and be great.</L>
<L>One only care your gentle breasts should move,</L>
<L>Th'important Business of your life is Love;</L>
<L>To this great point direct your constant aim,</L>
<L>This makes your Happiness, and this your Fame.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Be never cool reserve with passion join'd:</L>
<L>With caution chuse; but then be fondly kind.</L>
<L>The selfish heart, that but by halves is given,</L>
<L>Shall find no place in Love's delightful heav'n;</L>
<L>Here sweet extreams alone can truly bless.</L>
<L>The virtue of a lover is excess.</L>

<L>Contemn the little pride of giving pain;</L>
<L>Nor think that Conquest justifies Disdain;</L>
<L>Short is the period of insulting Pow'r;</L>
<L>Offended Cupid finds his vengeful hour,</L>

<L>Blest is the maid, and worthy to be blest,</L>
<L>Whose soul entire by him she loves possess'd,</L>
<L>Feels every vanity in fondness lost,</L>
<L>And asks no pow'r, but that of pleasing most:</L>
<L>Her's is the bliss in just return to prove</L>
<L>The honest warmth of undissembled Love;</L>
<L>For her, inconstant man might cease to range,</L>
<L>And Gratitude forbid Desire to change.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But lest harsh Care the lover's peace destroy,</L>
<L>And roughly blight the tender buds of joy,</L>
<L>Let Reason teach what Passion fain wou'd hide,</L>
<L>That Hymen's bands by Prudence should be ty'd.</L>
<L>Venus in vain the wedded pair would crown,</L>
<L>If angry fortune on their union frown:</L>
<L>Soon will the flatt'ring dream of bliss be o'er,</L>
<L>And cloy'd imagination cheat no more.</L>
<L>Then waking to the sense of lasting pain,</L>
<L>With mutual tears the nuptial couch they stain;</L>
<L>And that fond love, which should afford relief,</L>
<L>Does but encrease the anguish of their grief;</L>
<L><PB N="47" REF="48"/>
While both cou'd easier their own sorrows bear,</L>
<L>Than the sad knowledge of each other's care.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet may you rather feel that virtuous pain,</L>
<L>Than sell your violated charms for gain;</L>
<L>Than wed the wretch whom you despise, or hate,</L>
<L>For the vain glare of useless wealth or state.</L>
<L>The most abandon'd Prostitutes are they,</L>
<L>Who not to Love, but Av'rice fall a prey:</L>
<L>Nor aught avails the specious name of WIFE;</L>
<L>A maid so wedded, is a WHORE FOR LIFE.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ev'n in the happiest choice, where fav'ring heav'n</L>
<L>Has equal love, and easy fortune giv'n,</L>
<L>Think not, the Husband gain'd, that all is done;</L>
<L>The prize of Happiness must still be won;</L>
<L>And oft, the careless find it to their cost,</L>
<L>The <HI>Lover</HI> in the <HI>Husband</HI> may be lost:</L>
<L>The <HI>Graces</HI> might <HI>alone</HI> his heart <HI>allure;</HI></L>
<L><HI>They</HI> and the <HI>Virtues meeting</HI> must <HI>secure.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Let ev'n your <HI>Prudence</HI> wear the pleasing dress</L>
<L>Of care for <HI>him,</HI> and anxious <HI>tenderness.</HI></L>
<L>From kind concern about his weal, or woe,</L>
<L>Let each domestick duty seem to flow;</L>
<L>The HOUSHOLD SCEPTRE if he bids you bear,</L>
<L>Make it your pride his <HI>servant</HI> to appear:</L>
<L>Endearing thus the common acts of life,</L>
<L>The <HI>Mistress</HI> still shall charm him in the <HI>Wife;</HI></L>

<ITEM>JOHN, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The order of the GARTER was instituted on St. George's day the 23d of April 1350. King John came into England in 1357. I have taken the advantage of the licence usually allowed to poets, of departing a little from chronology; and have postponed for a few years the institution of this order, for the sake of rendering that solemnity more august, by introducing king John of France, who, though a prisoner, was treated both by Edward and his son the prince of Wales with all the regard due to the quality and virtue of so great a prince. To alleviate his captivity, Edward entertained him and the other French prisoners with diversions of various kinds: among which a tournament he held at Windsor on the 23d of April, to solemnize the feast of St. George, the patron of the order of the GARTER, held the chief place; and was, as Rapin tells us, the most sumptuous and magnificent that had ever been seen in England. The duke of Brabant, with several other sovereign princes, and an infinite number of knights of all nations were present, and splendidly enterâˆ£tained.</NOTE> King of France, &amp;c.</ITEM>

<L><NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Edward being engaged in a war with France, for the obtaining that crown, in order to draw into England great multitudes of foreigners, with whom he might negociate either for their personal service, or aids of troops to assist him in that undertaking, ordered, during the truce that then subsisted between the two crowns, publication to be made of a great tournament to be held at Windsor; an exâˆ£pedient, says Rapin, which could not fail of success, because it was entirely agreeable to the taste of that age. Accordâˆ£ingly many persons of distinction came over, to all of whom he gave an honourable reception, caressing them in such a manner that they could never sufficiently admire his politeness, magnificence, and liberality. To render these entertainments the more solemn, and to free himself also from the ceremoâˆ£nies, to which the difference of rank and condition would have subjected him, he caused a circular hall of boards to be run up at Windsor, 200 feet in diameter. There it was that he feasted all the knights at one table, which was called the Round Table, in memory of the great Arthur, who, as it is pretended, instituted an order of knighthood by that name. Next year he caused a more solid building to be erected, that he might continue yearly the same diverâˆ£sions. During that time he treated with these several lords about the aids, wherewith each could furnish him, in proportion to his forces. His rival king Philip could not see without jealousy, Spaniards, Italians, Germans, Fleâˆ£mings, and Frenchmen themselves flock to England to assist at these tournamrnts. He suspected some hidden design in these entertainments, and to break Edward's meosures, caused the like to be published in his dominions; which meeting with success, proved a countermine to Edward's main design, so that he did not long continue to keep up his round table. From thence, however, it is generally agreed, he took the first hint of instituting the order of the Garter. But as his purpose in erecting this order was very different from that which had induced him to revive Arthur's round table, as he had in this no private views, no ambitious scheme of engaging such as should be admitted into this fraternity to assist him in his wars, he thought proper, in order to obviate the like jealousies and suspicion as had alarmed king Philip, to signify by his motto the purity of his intentions, and to retort shame upon all those who should put any malignant construction upon his design in instituting this order. This therefore I take to be the true meaning and import of the famous motto, HONI SOIT QUI MAL Y PENSE. The not understanding the purport of which, gave rise in all probaâˆ£bility to that vulgar story of the countess of Salisbury's garter, rejected by all the best writers.</NOTE> ASHAM'D BE HE, WHO WITH MALIGNANT EYE</L>

<DIV2 TYPE="introduction">
<HEAD>INTRODUCTION to the PRINCE.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>NOR me the glories of thy birth engage,</L>
<L>With royal names to swell my pompous page:</L>
<L>Nor meaner views allure, in soothing lays</L>
<L>To court thy favour with officious praise.</L>
<L>Yet praise it is, thus to address thine ear</L>
<L>In strains no slave dares sing, no tyrant hear;</L>
<L>While warm for Britain's rights and nature's laws,</L>
<L>I call forth Britain's HOPE in freedom's cause;</L>
<L>Assert an empire which to ALL belongs,</L>
<L>And vindicate a world's long-suffer'd wrongs.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>These saving truths import thee most to know,</L>
<L>The links that tie the mighty to the low;</L>
<L>What now, our fellow-subject, is your due,</L>
<L>And, when our lord, shall be a debt on you.</L>
<L>O! may'st thou to the throne such maxims bring!</L>
<L>And feel the free-man, while thou reign'st the king.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="223" REF="223"/>
<L>Far hence the tribe, whose servile arts delude,</L>
<L>And teach the great to spurn the multitude.</L>
<L>Are those unworthy of the royal heir,</L>
<L>Who claim the future monarch's duteous care?</L>
<L>Still may thy thoughts the godlike task pursue,</L>
<L>And to the many ne'er prefer the few!</L>
<L>Still mayst thou fly thy fortune's specious friends,</L>
<L>Who deal forth sov'reign grace to private ends;</L>
<L>In narrow streams divert the copious tide,</L>
<L>Exalt one sect, and damn the world beside;</L>
<L>While with false lights directing partial rule,</L>
<L>The lord of nations falls a party's tool.</L>
<L>Such there have beenâ€”and such, in truth's despite,</L>
<L>Disgrac'd the cause of liberty and right.</L>
<L>But thou shalt rise superior to their arts,</L>
<L>And fix thy empire in a people's hearts.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nor hence may faction boast her favour'd claim,</L>
<L>Where selfish passions borrow virtue's name:</L>
<L>Free government alone preserves the free,</L>
<L>And righteous rule is gen'ral liberty;</L>
<L>There guiding law is freedom's native voice,</L>
<L>The publick good defin'd by publick choice;</L>
<L>And justly should the bold offenders fall,</L>
<L>Who dare invade the sov'reign rights of all:</L>
<L>A king who proudly makes these claims his own,</L>
<L>Or they whose rage would shake a lawful throne.</L>
<L>From truths like these proceeds a right divine,</L>
<L>And may the power that rais'd, preserve thy scepter'd line!</L>

<L>YOU ask me, sir, why thus by phantoms aw'd,</L>
<L>No kind occasion tempts the muse abroad?</L>
<L>Why, when retirement sooths this idle art,</L>
<L>To fame regardless sleeps the youthful heart?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Twou'd wrong your judgment, shou'd I fairly say</L>
<L>Distrust or weakness caus'd the cold delay;</L>
<L>Hint the small diff'rence, till we touch the lyre,</L>
<L>'Twixt real genius and too strong desire;</L>
<L>The human slips, or seeming slips pretend,</L>
<L>That rouse the critick, but escape the friend;</L>
<L>Nay which, tho' dreadful when the foe pursues,</L>
<L>You'd pass, and smile, and still provoke the muse.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet, spite of all you think, or kindly feign,</L>
<L>My hand will tremble while it grasps the pen.</L>
<L>For not in this, like other arts, we try</L>
<L>Our light excursions in a summer sky,</L>
<L><PB N="243" REF="243"/>
No casual flights the dang'rous trade admits,</L>
<L>But wits once authors, are for ever wits.</L>
<L>The fool in prose, like earth's unwieldy son,</L>
<L>May oft rise vig'rous, tho' he's oft o'erthrown;</L>
<L>One dang'rous crisis marks our rise or fall,</L>
<L>By all we're courted, or we're shunn'd by all.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What will't avail, that, unmatur'd by years,</L>
<L>My easy numbers pleas'd your partial ears,</L>
<L>If now condemn'd, my riper lays must bear</L>
<L>The wise man's censure, and the critick's sneer?</L>
<L>Or, still more hard, ev'n where he's valu'd most,</L>
<L>The man must suffer, if the poet's lost;</L>
<L>For wanting wit, be totally undone,</L>
<L>And barr'd all arts, for having fail'd in one.</L>
<L>When fears like these his serious thoughts engage,</L>
<L>No bugbear phantom curbs the poet's rage;</L>
<L>'Tis pow'rful reason holds the streighten'd rein,</L>
<L>While flutt'ring fancy to the distant plain</L>
<L>Sends a long look, and spreads her wings in vain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But grant, for once, th' officious muse has shed</L>
<L>Her gentlest influence on his infant head.</L>
<L>Let fears lie vanquish'd, and resounding fame</L>
<L>Give to the bellowing blast the poet's name.</L>
<L>And see! distinguish'd from the croud he moves,</L>
<L>Each finger marks him, and each eye approves!</L>
<L>Secure, as Halcyons brooding o'er the deep,</L>
<L>The waves roll gently, and the thunders sleep,</L>
<L><PB N="244" REF="244"/>
Obsequious nature binds the tempest's wings,</L>
<L>And pleas'd attention listens whilst he sings!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O blissful state! O more than human joy!</L>
<L>What shafts can reach him, or what cares annoy?</L>
<L>What cares, my friend? why all that man can know,</L>
<L>Oppress'd with real, or with fancy'd woe.</L>
<L>Rude to the world, like earth's first lord expell'd,</L>
<L>To climes unknown, from Eden's safer field;</L>
<L>No more eternal springs around him breathe,</L>
<L>Black air scowls o'er him, deadly damps beneath;</L>
<L>Now must he learn, misguided youth, to bear</L>
<L>Each varying season of the poet's year;</L>
<L>Flatt'ry's full beam, detraction's wintry store,</L>
<L>The frowns of fortune, or the pride of pow'r.</L>
<L>His acts, his words, his thoughts no more his own,</L>
<L>Each folly blazon'd, and each frailty known.</L>
<L>Is he reserv'd?â€”his sense is so refin'd</L>
<L>It ne'er-descends to trifle with mankind.</L>
<L>Open and free?â€”they find the secret cause</L>
<L>Is vanity, and courts the world's applause.</L>
<L>Nay, tho' he speak not, something still is seen,</L>
<L>Each change of face betrays a fault within.</L>
<L>If grave, 'tis spleen; he smiles but to deride;</L>
<L>And downright aukwardness in him is pride.</L>
<L>Thus must he steer thro' fame's uncertain seas,</L>
<L>Now sunk by censure, and now puff'd by praise;</L>
<L>Contempt with envy strangely mix'd endure,</L>
<L>Fear'd where caress'd, and jealous tho' secure.</L>

<L>One fatal rock on which good authors split</L>

<LG>
<L>PHoebe, thank thy false heart, it has fix'd my repose,</L>
<L>The gods have had pity at length on my woes;</L>
<L>I feel it, I feel my soul loose from its chain,</L>
<L>And at last freedom comes, often dream'd of in vain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="312" REF="312"/>
<L>The flame is burn'd out, and each passion at rest,</L>
<L>Under which love disguis'd still might lurk in my breast;</L>
<L>No more, when thou'rt nam'd, the warm blushes arise,</L>
<L>No more flutters my heart, when I meet with your eyes.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In my sleep now no longer thy image I see,</L>
<L>Nor the first of my thoughts, when I wake, is of thee;</L>
<L>When from thee, no more of thy absence I plain,</L>
<L>When with thee, I feel neither pleasure nor pain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>My heart without fondness can muse on thy charms,</L>
<L>My past pains I recount, yet no passion alarms;</L>
<L>Discompos'd I'm no longer, when tow'rd me you move,</L>
<L>And at ease with my rival, I talk of my love.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Whether haughty thy frown, whether gentle thy strain,</L>
<L>In vain thy proud looks, thy fond speeches in vain;</L>
<L>Thy false tongue to beguile me no more has the art,</L>
<L>No more thy keen eye knows the way to my heart.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Whether pensive or cheerful, no longer to you</L>
<L>For this are my thanks, or for that my blame due:</L>
<L>The gay prospect now pleases, though you are away,</L>
<L>And your presence no more can make dreariness gay.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Believe me, I still can allow that thou'rt fair,</L>
<L>But not that no fair-one can with thee compare;</L>
<L><PB N="313" REF="313"/>
And though beauteous I own thee, yet still in thy face</L>
<L>I can now spy a fault, which I once thought a grace.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When first the fix'd arrow I pluck'd from my heart,</L>
<L>Oh, methought I shou'd die! so severe was the smart:</L>
<L>But from pow'r so oppressive to set myself clear,</L>
<L>Torments greater than dying with patience I'd bear.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When lim'd the poor bird thus with eagerness strains,</L>
<L>Nor regrets the lost plume, so his freedom he gains;</L>
<L>The loss of his plumage small time will restore,</L>
<L>And once try'd the false twig, it can cheat him no more.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The old flame, never flatter yourself to believe,</L>
<L>While it dwells on my tongue, in my heart still must live:</L>
<L>Our dangers, when past, with delight we repeat,</L>
<L>What in suffering was pain, to remembrance is sweet.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Tis thus when the soldier returns from the wars,</L>
<L>He fights o'er his old battles, and vaunts of his scars:</L>
<L>With pleasure the captive his liberty gain'd</L>
<L>The fetters thus shows, which once held him enchain'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus I talk, and I still will talk on while I may,</L>
<L>Nor heed I, though you disbelieve what I say:</L>
<L>I ask not that Phoebe my talk should approve,</L>
<L>Let her too, if she can, talk at ease of my love.</L>

<L>THrough the close covert of the shady grove,</L>
<L>One summer's day it was my chance to rove,</L>
<L>Where, shrouded from the sun's too scorching ray,</L>
<L>Stretch'd at her ease, half-slumbering Cloe lay.</L>
<L>Occasion so inviting who could miss?</L>
<L>Softly I stole, and snatch'd a sudden kiss.</L>
<L>Startled at first, the rising blush display'd</L>
<L>The quick resentment of the ruffled maid:</L>
<L>Lively display'dâ€”for soon it over past;</L>

<L>Submissive looks my pardon soon obtain'd,</L>

'Till warn'd, too soon, by envious night, we part:</L>

Before me hand in hand sometimes they move,</L>
