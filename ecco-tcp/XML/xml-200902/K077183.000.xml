<P>PHILLIS AT COURT; A COMIC OPERA Of THREE ACTS. As it is now performing, with great Applause, At the THEATRE-ROYAL In CROW-STREET, DUBLIN.</P>
<P>The Music by Signior TOMASO GIORDANI.</P>

<HEAD>Advertisement.</HEAD>
<P>IT may be proper to take notice, that the Title given this Piece, at present, is copied from the French of <HI>Monsieur Favart;</HI> whose <HI>Caprices D' A∣mour, ou Ninette a la Cour,</HI> the Author, Mr. <HI>Lloyd,</HI> confesses was the ground-work of his Piece, called the <HI>Capricious Lovers.</HI></P>
<P>In order to make that Piece entertaining, (and in conformity with the <HI>Italian Burletta</HI>) Musical Dialogues have been added towards the end of each Act; these are known among the Italians by the word <HI>Finale,</HI> and are deemed indispensably ne∣cessary in an entertainment of this sort. It is now presented to the Public with many alterations. Several Airs have been added, others again sup∣pressed; and adapted to the talents of the diffe∣rent performers, some of them being Foreigners.</P>
<P>As it was necessary to alter the Title of this Opera, to that of <HI>Phillis at Court,</HI> on account of the alterations made in it, and to prevent one copy being taken for the other, 'tis hoped it will meet with the approbation of the Publick.</P>

<P>Upon my word, ladies, you reason excellently well in your turn. I perceive the advice of every body flows from self-interested motives. You would most ob∣ligingly inform me that my presence displeases you, ma∣dam; I heartily believe it—But, now I think on it, I can't go yet, 'tis absolutely impossible.

<P>Oh, doubtless. It is not for folks in such an humble situation as mine to refuse so great an honour, and, indeed, after so many instances of friendship and protection, it were a sin to deny so small a request. But, I see, Madam, you are discompos'd.</P>

<P>Come, come, don't be suspicious; where you dread a rival, you may find a friend. I pity your unea∣siness, madam, nor will I ever be the cause of adding to it. Come, then with me, and, if possible, endeavour to forget your jealous resentment. I warrant you all will be well yet.</P>
