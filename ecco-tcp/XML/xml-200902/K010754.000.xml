<HEAD>THE INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>THE character that this Swedish Giant gives of himself, of his being the greatest wonder, of the kind, that ever appeared in this kingdom; that all ranks of people receive a pleasing satisfac∣tion that see him, and
<PB N="xvii" REF="15"/>express their surprize at his huge stature; which, he says, exceeds that of any Giant since the great Goliah of Gath, whom David slew.</P>
<P>This account must needs very much awaken the attention of our youth, especially such as have no opportunity to see this big Man; I think myself, therefore, under an obli∣gation to my young read∣ers,
<PB N="xviii" REF="16"/>who have promoted the sale of my <HI>gigantick Volumes,</HI> to give them the History of this mighty <HI>Christian Goliah,</HI> as he calls himself: in which I hope to satisfy their curi∣osity, to do honour to his Giantship, and at the same time vindicate the merit of my much re∣spected friends and next neighbours, the two Giants in Guildhall, Gogmagog and Corinaeus.</P>

<HEAD>THE HISTORY Of the <HI>Swedish</HI> GIANT.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I. <HI>Of the Giant's country, birth, parentage, and education.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THIS Swedish Giant was born at Oulo, or
<PB N="20" REF="18"/>Ula. a port town situated on the east side of the Bot∣nick Bay in Finland, bor∣dering on Russia, in the year 1709. His Father's name was <HI>Cajanus;</HI> a man of a good character, but better noted for his gi∣gantick size, than for fa∣mily or fortune; though without doubt he came from a race of Giants, which it is too trouble∣some at this time to trace
<PB N="21" REF="19"/>to the original. His Mo∣ther likewise was of an uncommon height, which exceeded seven feet; and his Sister, now living, is still taller; who, perhaps, should she live to see her Brother return, and know his good luck, may take it in her head to travel upon the same errand.</P>
<P>Of these Great Parents was our Giant born, and
<PB N="22" REF="20"/>his size proves he was no bastard.</P>
<P>His honest, careful old Father, bestowed on him an education suitable to his own circumstances, and his Son's capacity for learning, which never ap∣peared very quick or live∣ly; and endeavoured to plant in him, whilst young, the seeds of true honour and virtue. He likewise brought him up to indus∣try,
<PB N="23" REF="21"/>to work in the gar∣den with the spade, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and to labour in the field in husbandry affairs, and in short, to get his bread by the sweat of his brow.</P>
<P>As no extraordinary e∣vent attended his younger years, he eat, drank, and play'd like other youth, only more at a time, and grew faster; we'll pass over this part of his life, and follow him to the next stage.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="24" REF="22"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Of the Giant's falling in love with a farmer's daughter, named</HI> Dolla Rucina: <HI>How he made known his passion to her father, and what recep∣tion he met with.</HI></P>
<P>NEar to Oulo lived a∣wealthy farmer, who had an only daughter of great beauty, and possess∣ed
<PB N="25" REF="23"/>of all the virtues which render those charms the more amiable: She was likewise trained from her infancy to industry, by the care and example of a good Mother, who taught her to spin flax and wool; to milk the kine; to make cheese and butter, and all that was necessary for the female part, in the dairy, the house, the garden, or the field; so that she had
<PB N="26" REF="24"/>no idle hours to spend in dress, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Nor did she need it; for nature had been very indulgent in plentifully bestowing gra∣ces to set her off, without any art or fallacy.</P>
<P>The perfections of this fair maid had taken deep root in our Giant's heart, so that in her center'd all his happiness. He had demonstrated a good judg∣ment in placing his affec∣tions
<PB N="27" REF="25"/>on one so worthy: but how to gain her was the point. He suffered Love's flame to smother a long time in his breast, be∣fore he dared to undertake this adventure. He was at this time a comely young man; and though he was tall, his stature might have been dispens∣ed with, had he ceased growing: but his conti∣nuing to increase in bulk
<PB N="28" REF="26"/>and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> made him al∣most despair of success: for he could not well ex∣pect <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> would venture herself with a man of so preposterous a size.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding these checks and rep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ses, which presented themselves con∣cerning the difficulty of this undertaking, he at length, with the courage of a Giant, pluck'd up a
<PB N="29" REF="27"/>good heart, and ventured one pleasant evening to visit this fair damsel, to whom he was not altoge∣ther a stranger. She re∣ceived him with great discretion and caution, and he behaved with much po∣liteness and good manners.</P>
<P>After some little time he address'd himself to <HI>Dolla Rucina</HI>'s father, and with a graceful air told his errand; and with great
<PB N="30" REF="28"/>modesty desired his per∣mission to visit his charm∣ing daughter, the lovely <HI>Dolla Rucina;</HI> and tho' his designs were strictly honourable, he would not enter upon a business of so great a concern without his leave.</P>
<P>The father answer'd, Thou hast done well, young man, in first mak∣ing known this affair unto me; but what thou askest
<PB N="31" REF="29"/>is of so great moment, that it requires much con∣sideration: I cannot there∣fore immediately consent to what thou requirest, till I have well weighed it in my own mind. Tell me, therefore, thy name, parentage, and place of abode. The young Giant answered, My name is <HI>Daniel Cajanus,</HI> son of the old <HI>Cajanus,</HI> of Oulo. An honest and reputable fami∣ly,
<PB N="32" REF="30"/>replied the old man: thy father was not un∣known to me. Thou shalt be welcome to my house, and to such good cheer as it will afford.</P>
<P><HI>Dolla Rucina</HI>'s parents entertain'd <HI>Cajanus</HI> with bowls of most delicious cream; pails of syllabub; fresh cheese and butter; all sorts of choice fruit that their garden or orchard produced; with several
<PB N="33" REF="31"/>kinds of refreshing liquors; and, what was more dear to him than all other de∣lights, a reception which gave him great hopes, that one day he should obtain possession of the most love∣ly object of his affection.</P>
<P>Our young Giant be∣ing thus fortunate in his first adventure, often re∣sorted to this fair maiden, who as constantly receiv∣ed him; and, with her
<PB N="34" REF="32"/>parents leave, entertained him in the same generous manner; plentifully, and yet prudently, regaling him with good cheer, and a hearty welcome.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="35" REF="33"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<P><HI>How the Giant was disap∣pointed in gaining the fair</HI> Dolla Rucina; <HI>and what followed.</HI></P>
<P>AFter a considerable time spent in court∣ing the beautiful <HI>Dolla Rucina,</HI> wherein success seemed to favour all <HI>Caja∣nus</HI>'s wishes, and he even rioted in excess of plea∣sures;
<PB N="36" REF="34"/>the parents of this fair maid, to whom she was very dear, told her with much tenderness, lest it should cause too great an uneasiness in her mind; for she had, during the visits of <HI>Cajanus,</HI> conceiv∣ed a very good liking to his person; his great bulk was the only objection, and the remarks which the world made of the dispro∣portion in their size. That
<PB N="37" REF="35"/>they should inform <HI>Caja∣nus,</HI> at his next visit, that they could not approve of a match so unequal; that they were sorry they had not broke it off sooner; and advised their daughter no longer to entertain thoughts of marrying a man whose size exceeded all reason. <HI>Dolla Rucina,</HI> ever obedient to her pa∣rents, promised them that she would no longer re∣ceive
<PB N="38" REF="36"/>him upon that foot∣ing; but as they com∣manded only.</P>
<P>The great disproportion in their size had often given much disquietude to these lovers, and interrupt∣ed their greatest and most innocent enjoyments, long before <HI>Dolla Rucina</HI> had received this injunction from her father.</P>
<P>She at this time reach'd but a little above <HI>Cajanus</HI>'s
<PB N="39" REF="37"/>waste, and was of an agree∣able size, and not likely to be taller. He, who alrea∣dy surpass'd all mankind in heighth, was still growing on apace, as if he intend∣ed to tower above the skies.</P>
<P>It was likewise a great mortification to the hap∣piness of this unequal pair, to hear themselves ridicul'd upon that ac∣count, by all the young
<PB N="40" REF="38"/>people in the country round about; to whom this courtship was well known, and which afford∣ed them much diversion.</P>
<P><HI>Dolla Rucina</HI> desired leave of her father, that she herself might make this affair known to <HI>Ca∣janus:</HI> to which he free∣ly consented.</P>
<P>This fair damsel had that same evening reso∣lution enough to tell <HI>Ca∣janus</HI>
<PB N="41" REF="39"/>all that her father and mother advised her to, which was calculated for the good of them both: and this she broke to him in the following manner.</P>
<P>After a deep sigh, she said, Dear <HI>Cajanus,</HI> thou hast need to arm thyself with all the fortitude thou art master of, lest what I have to tell thee wound so deep, that it overwhelm thy poor spirit. Alas!
<PB N="42" REF="40"/><HI>Dolla Rucina</HI> has this day received a strict charge from her parents, no lon∣ger to entertain thee on any other terms than that of a friend. This charge from my father is of so much consequence, and concerns the happiness of us both, that I cannot dis∣obey it.</P>
<P><HI>Cajanus</HI> at this news was struck dumb, not one word could he utter, till
<PB N="43" REF="41"/>after some time; he with∣drew, gave vent to his passion in a torrent of tears which flowed from his eyes in great abundance.</P>
<P><HI>Dolla Rucina</HI>'s parents endeavoured by reason to pacify his great grief, but no arguments made any impression; time only was to recover him.</P>
<P>However, in some little time he began to recollect himself; to walk, talk,
<PB N="44" REF="42"/>and use his reason. And before his departure they regaled him with curds, cream, and other country fare, as usual; which <HI>Ca∣janus</HI> was a dear lover of, and fed pretty cheerfully upon.</P>
<P>After this refreshment he bid adieu to his dear <HI>Dolla Rucina,</HI> paid his re∣spects to her worthy pa∣rents, and then walk'd lei∣surely home, with a belly
<PB N="45" REF="43"/>brimful of good cheer, a heart loaded with sorrow, and a head full of thoughts of what had happen'd, and of contriving what course to take. This held him till he got home, and to bed; where he spent the night in uttering deep sighs and bitter groans: Grief and melancholly had seized his heart, de∣jection was visible in his countenance.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="44"/>The friends of <HI>Cajanus</HI> endeavoured, as <HI>Dolla Ru∣cina</HI>'s had done before, to comfort him under this heavy trial, but in vain; he would yield to no per∣swasions: they left him therefore to his own course, which seemed fixt upon a firm resolution of visiting foreign parts.</P>
<P>Upon every disappoint∣ment which <HI>Cajanus</HI> met with, a natural sullenness
<PB N="47" REF="45"/>followed, which would yield to no arguments of reason; but was forced to be left always to his own will to rectify. This was the occasion of some ex∣traordinary trouble both to himself and to his friends.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="48" REF="46"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Of the Giant's resolving to leave his country: How he was invited into the army; and what follow∣ed.</HI></P>
<P>THE disappointment which <HI>Cajanus</HI> met with in his love-adven∣ture, was soon spread over the town of Oulo, and the neighbouring villages;
<PB N="49" REF="47"/>that he became the jest of all the young people of those parts, to whom this amour was well known. He shut himself up there∣fore from society, refus∣ing any longer to appear in publick: and upon this account came to a fixed resolution of leaving his native place, and visiting foreign climates.</P>
<P>There happen'd at this time to be recruiting offi∣cers
<PB N="50" REF="48"/>in the town of Oulo, who were raising men for the service of the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> who was then about assembling a large army for the recovery of Finland from the Russians, or some other important enterprize; being spirited up by the artful contri∣vance of a mitred priest, who was chief in the ca∣binet of a great prince.</P>
<P>These officers being in∣sormed
<PB N="51" REF="49"/>of the Giant's de∣sign of going abroad, en∣deavoured to engage him to enter into the army; to which end they tempt∣ed him with money; they promised to get him pro∣moted: but neither of these allurements had any influence on <HI>Cajanus.</HI></P>
<P>It was likewise strongly represented to him, how much his king and coun∣try stood in need at that
<PB N="52" REF="50"/>time of his service, and the honour he might get to himself. He was still deaf to all this; and chose rather to leave his coun∣try and kindred exposed to the havock and misery of war, than to lend them his assistance.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="53" REF="51"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. V.</HEAD>
<P><HI>How the example of some mighty Giants of old was proposed to</HI> Cajanus; <HI>how be rejected them with disdain: and whether this great Swedish Gi∣ant is not a very great coward.</HI></P>
<P>THE first is <HI>Goliah,</HI> the great Giant of Gath, who made the
<PB N="54" REF="52"/>whole host of the Israelites to quake: Even King Saul himself, who was taller than any man in his army, and a valiant soldier too, was afraid of this great Philistine. He went out day by day, and vaunted out his insolent speeches, and hold threats of pick∣ing their bones, and giv∣ing their flesh to the fowls of the air and beasts of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. This put Saul and
<PB N="55" REF="53"/>his army into so great a panick, that had it not been for the fortunate stone from the sling of young David, the son of Jesse, it might have gain∣ed the Philistine army the victory.</P>
<P>The next is the strong and valiant <HI>Sampson;</HI> who, when he was laid down to repose himself, and his enemies were stealing un∣awares to seize him; it
<PB N="56" REF="54"/>was no sooner called out to him, <HI>Sampson, the Phi∣listines are upon thee;</HI> but he starts up, lays hold of the first weapon in his way, even the jaw-bone of an ass, with which he laid about him so fast, that he smote them hip and thigh, and after he had surveyed the slain, he sat down and composed a song of tri∣umph; viz. <HI>Heaps upon heaps: with the jaw-bone
<PB N="57" REF="55"/>of an ass I have slain a thousand men.</HI> True cou∣rage never wants a wea∣pon.</P>
<P>We read in the Histo∣ry of the Kings of Israel, of the mighty Tachmo∣nite, named <HI>Adino,</HI> who slew eight hundred at one time. And of <HI>Eleazar,</HI> the son of Dodo, who rout∣ed a whole army. Sacred Writ mentions many such stout champions who de∣voted
<PB N="58" REF="56"/>their service for the defence of their country. Profane history relates the same of all their great heroes.</P>
<P>The noble actions of these brave old Giants, was no inducement to <HI>Ca∣janus;</HI> he was afraid of being placed in the front of the battle, to have the rough musick of musket balls whistling in his ears. The thoughts of this was
<PB N="59" REF="57"/>death to him. How far short does this Swedish Giant's courage fall of Gi∣ant Gogmagog's, who, even now in his old age, will stand the fire of a whole regiment of our va∣liant city train'd-bands, without winching? and his stout brother Corineus will do the same.</P>
<P>Giant <HI>Cajanus</HI> would hearken to no proposals of going into the army; and
<PB N="60" REF="58"/>told the recruiting officers that he look'd upon what they had promised, as on∣ly to inveigle and trappan him, and not in their power to perform; and therefore gave them an absolute denial, that he would not accept of a soldier's life: and refused to be seen by them any more.</P>
<P>As Giant <HI>Cajanus</HI> grew up, he shewed a lesser
<PB N="61" REF="59"/>inclination to a military life than was expected: for instead of a brave mar∣tial spirit, of gaining glo∣ry in the field of war, he had a natural aversion to the life of a soldier; and chose rather to travel like a vagabond, to shew his great bulk for lucre: which shews that the big∣gest men have not always the stoutest hearts.</P>
<P>How pleasant would it
<PB N="62" REF="60"/>have been for future ages to have read in the Swe∣dish chronicle of the glo∣rious atchievements of the great <HI>Cajanus,</HI> when he appeared in the day of battle in the fore front of the army? that to him, in a great measure, might be owing, victory against the Russians.</P>
<P>He might have been made to look very terrible and fierce, by gracing his
<PB N="63" REF="61"/>head with a stately strong helmet, properly adorn'd, which might have added to his stature two or three foot; and given him a handsome &amp; strong shield; likewise to have fenced his body with armour of po∣lish'd steel, and a sword answerable to his great size; so to have equipp'd him every way like a man of war. And then, if he had had no true courage
<PB N="64" REF="62"/>of his own, he might have pretended to vaunt it out with big words, like the braggadocias of Totten∣ham-court, of what they can do; though they ne∣ver design to hurt their powerful antagonist. Such language, perhaps, might intimidate an enemy, and thereby have gain'd ad∣vantage to themselves.</P>
<P>Giant <HI>Cajanus</HI> had been privately inform'd, that the
<PB N="65" REF="63"/>recruiting officers expect∣ed an order to press him into the King's service, he therefore agrees with the captain of a ship to carry him to Holland.</P>
<P>He immediately pre∣pares for his voyage, takes leave of all his friends, and before his departure he went and took his last farewel of the charming <HI>Dolla Rucina,</HI> and her good father and mother.
<PB N="66" REF="64"/>They gave him a hearty welcome: so that having eat of their meat and drank of their nectar, they em∣braced with great tender∣ness, and bid a final adieu to each other.</P>
<P>I should have told my readers, that <HI>Dolla Ruci∣na</HI> was now married to a young farmer, whose fa∣ther was lately dead, and had left him in possession of a rich farm. They were
<PB N="67" REF="65"/>agreeable in size and cir∣cumstances, and had the prospect of being a very happy couple: in which state we shall leave her, and trace the footsteps of young Giant <HI>Cajanus</HI> on∣ly.</P>

<P><HI>Of what befel</HI> Cajanus <HI>in his passage from Fin∣land to England.</HI></P>
<P>GIant <HI>Cajanus,</HI> having provided all things necessary for this voyage, and the ship being ready to fail, went aboard as private as he could; where <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ving stow'd himself in the great cabbin, not car∣ing
<PB N="69" REF="67"/>to shew himself till at sea; the captain gave or ders to weigh anchor and set fail; a fresh gale of wind springing up, which soon run them out of sight of Oulo, and held favourable all down the Botnick Bay: they had likewise good weather thro' the Baltick sea.</P>
<P><HI>Cajanus</HI> was well used by the captain, who en∣tertain'd him with his
<PB N="70" REF="68"/>adventures in many voy∣ages and travels to foreign parts, and the dangers he escap'd; very pleasant to hear, but too much to relate in this History. <HI>Ca∣janus,</HI> in his turn, enter∣tain'd the captain with his own adventures by land: these relations were often season'd with good bowls of punch, canns of flip, and other refreshing li∣quors. And thus they
<PB N="71" REF="69"/>spent their time, during a safe and quick passage to Holland; in which no real dangers or misfor∣tunes happen'd: except∣in a stiff gale of wind, which they met with one evening off the coast of Norway, which obliged them to hand all their top-fails, and to fail under them three coasts: there run a very great head-sea, and the sheets being close
<PB N="72" REF="70"/>haul'd, she made but dull way thro' the water; it was beside dark hazy wea∣ther. The failors had of∣ten been in greater storms than that, and so made light of it. But the case of poor <HI>Cajanus</HI> was quite different; he expected no∣thing less than to be swal∣lowed up every minute by the waves. The ship sometimes heel'd gunnel too, which is common in
<PB N="73" REF="71"/>a gale of wind; this so much added to <HI>Cajanus</HI>'s fright, to see the water come upon deck, that he laid himself along, and held fast by some ropes at the weather-side, where he was continually sliding over to leeward, and crawl∣ing back again: and so, like Sisiphus with his stone, his work was never done.</P>
<P>The sailors endeavour'd to hearten him up at this
<PB N="74" REF="72"/>time; but nothing would do, till <HI>Cajanus</HI> saw the storm abate, day-light ap∣pear, and a brave bowl of punch before him: He then look'd as stout as the best man aboard the ship.</P>
<P><HI>Cajanus</HI> arriv'd safe in Holland, and having made the best advantage he could there, being told how fond the English people are of foreign novelties, especial∣ly of a tame Giant, he
<PB N="75" REF="73"/>might find his account in it, if he would visit that country; for he would be look'd upon as a very great curiosity; perhaps the big∣gest that ever was seen in that land.</P>
<P>The Giant being in∣structed how he should be∣have when he came over, embark'd for England; where landing safe, he set out privately for London, and took up his residence
<PB N="76" REF="74"/>at Charing-cross: and having recovered himself from the fatigues of his journey, began to publish his arrival.</P>

<P><HI>How Giant</HI> Cajanus <HI>sold himself to the renowned Giant</HI> Pinchbone, <HI>one of the sons of</HI> Tubal∣cain, <HI>the inventer of a rich metal nearly resem∣bling gold: and how his master chang'd his name from</HI> Cajanus, <HI>to that of</HI> Puss.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="76"/>UPon the first notice of the arrival of this Grant at Charing-cross, his fame was soon spread over the whole town; so that there was a great re∣sort of persons of all ranks to see him, at <HI>one Shilling</HI> each; which was a great profit to <HI>Cajanus,</HI> and an encouragement he ought to have been contented with.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="77"/>Giant <HI>Pinchbone,</HI> who is better known for viva∣city of parts, and a pene∣trating genius, than for enormous heighth, or bulk of body; visiting among other company, and ob∣serving how well pleased every one was with the sight of him, began pre∣sently to medltate and contrive how he might make advantage to himself by shewing this huge man.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="78"/>In a little time, by fre∣quent visits, he became so well acquainted with Gi∣ant <HI>Caianus,</HI> that he ob∣served him to be of a ve∣ry covetous temper; and therefore was to be at∣tack'd on that quarter. Ac∣cordingly, an offer being made, he soon listned to the proposal; and at last agreed, that Giant <HI>Pinch∣bone,</HI> for a sum of money (some say <HI>two hundred
<PB N="81" REF="79"/>Pounds)</HI> should have the use of him for a certain time (<HI>six Months,</HI> as 'tis said) to expose to view, and to make what advan∣tage he could by shewing him. Articles being drawn up, and sign'd, the Giant took the money, the sight of which made him to smile, and put it into a purse, and that safe into his pocket: This done, he delivers himself, body
<PB N="82" REF="80"/>and soul, whole and en∣tire, with the purchase money in his breeches, in∣to the hands of his mas∣ter, who was very well pleas'd with his bargain.</P>
<P>Giant <HI>Pinchbone</HI> having got the full possession of the <HI>Swedish Giant</HI> into his own hands, he presently changed his name to <HI>Puff,</HI> by publishing him to the world under all the ex∣aggerating titles that his
<PB N="83" REF="81"/>great genius could invent: such as
<Q>the greatest curiosity that ever was seen in this kingdom; the surprising Giant; the wonderful Colosius; the Christian <HI>Goliah;</HI></Q> and many other swell'd epi∣thets: and at length that he was speedily to se out for Portugal. By these means, this son of Tub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, soon got his purchase money in again.</P>

<P><HI>How Giant</HI> Puff <HI>was afraid he had made a compact with the Devil, by what be had done: and how his master deliver'd him from such terrible ap∣prehensions.</HI></P>
<P>SOon after <HI>Puff</HI> had sold himself, the De∣vil's Agent came to <HI>Pinch∣bone,</HI> to see if he would
<PB N="85" REF="83"/>part with him again; and to know his price, and what he was fit for. When upon examination, finding that he was no Black∣smith, Wheelwright, Saw∣yer, Cooper, Carpenter, Joiner, Taylor, nor any other serviceable trade, he declined having any thing to do with him: Tho' his master was of more ho∣nour, and knew better his own interest, than to have
<PB N="86" REF="84"/>sold him to the Devil, if his Agent had liked him.</P>
<P>The great Giant <HI>Puff</HI> was not so big a fool, but he understood the Agent's business: he grew very uneasy at what he had done: and was afraid that he had already enter'd in∣to Articles with the De∣vil. He had read of per∣sons selling themselves, and making such compacts for a term of years, at the end
<PB N="87" REF="85"/>of which they were fetcht away: the thoughts here∣of terribly frighted this mighty <HI>Christian Goliah.</HI></P>
<P>This threw the Giant into despair. He was jea∣lous of his master; and expected no other than the Devil to send his Agent for him. His mas∣ter endeavour'd to free him from these fears; and to divert his mind, pro∣mised to shew him Oxon,
<PB N="88" REF="86"/><HI>&amp;c.</HI> by which means he in some measure recover'd him from his melancholy.</P>

<PB N="90" REF="88"/>known, but the curious from all parts flock'd to see him; especially the students of the University, who were well satisfied with the sight of this liv∣ing Colossus. They ne∣ver before had seen any thing but the bones of dead Giants; such as long shins, and thighs, great ribs, vast skulls, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> They had read indeed of the Philistine, <HI>Goliah</HI> of Gath,
<PB N="91" REF="89"/>and his brothers; and of the enormous size of <HI>Og,</HI> king of Bashan, and ma∣ny more, mentioned in holy writ. And likewise some very monstrous big Giants which the learned tell us of. But here was a living proof of there be∣ing Giants; a man who measured in heighth eight foot four inches without shoes; and could reach ten and a half: And when
<PB N="92" REF="90"/>he was in health, his bulk was in proportion to that of his heighth. Sure this is demonstration enough to end all disputes about the existence of Giants.</P>
<P>I make no doubt but that there has appear'd, at different times, all those that have been mentioned by historians; tho' now, by length of time, they seem like monstrous and fabulous relations.</P>

<P><HI>How some unlucky scholars had formed a plot for seizing the Giant in one of his night peram∣bulations: and how he was delivered out of their hands, and got safe to town.</HI></P>
<P>DUring the time that the <HI>Swedish</HI> Giant
<PB N="94" REF="92"/>was at Oxford, some in∣genious scholars, who per∣haps could not afford to pay for the sight of him, enter'd into a design of seizing, and carrying him by main force to some private place; where they intended to have read a lecture upon this great man, and to have exa∣mined him joint by joint, and limb by limb. In order, therefore, to put
<PB N="95" REF="93"/>this scheme in execution, it was agreed to seize him in one of his evening sal∣lies: it being customary for the Giant to take a small airing, when the ci∣ty was in profound rest. This plot was carried in∣to execution by a few of them, who were despe∣rate and resolute: they knew he had not courage to defend himself. The Giant being laid hold on,
<PB N="96" REF="94"/>was carried to a proper place; and a watch set over him, with a promise he should come to no harm, if he would be quiet; and the next day be set at liberty. <HI>Pinch∣bone,</HI> his master, used all the arguments he could think of, to procure his Giant's liberty: but no∣thing could prevail with them, till he pull'd out some of his curious metal
<PB N="97" REF="95"/>toys, which he distribut∣ed amongst them, and which they took in rea∣lity for gold: This so blinded their eyes, that after they had a little sa∣tisfied their curiosity, in viewing him from head to toe, he was set at li∣berty: which he had no sooner regain'd, but he begg'd of his master to leave that city; which he readily consented to, and
<PB N="98" REF="96"/>gave him a guide directly to London; and discharg∣ed his lodging, and fol∣lowed him.</P>
<P>Giant <HI>Puff,</HI> whenever he heard any travellers, either behind or before, always stepp'd into the hedge, and there stood upright; which in the night look'd like the bo∣dy or trunk of an old tree. By which cunning stra∣tagem he escaped safe to
<PB N="99" REF="97"/>town, without any thing remarkable happening</P>
<P>He was convey'd to an apartment facing the Man∣sion-house; where he re∣mains this 24<SUP>th</SUP> of Au∣gust, 1742. under the circumstances described in the following chapter.</P>
<P>The time being now expired that he sold him∣self for, <HI>Pinchbone,</HI> like an honourable master, de∣livered Giant <HI>Puff</HI> into

<HEAD>CHAP. XI.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Of the present situation of Giant</HI> Puff; <HI>with a de∣scription of him.</HI></P>
<P>THis wonderful Co∣lossus is cramm'd, like a Maramotte, in a box, in a small close back
<PB N="101" REF="99"/>room, up one pair of stairs, facing the Mansion-house; where, perhaps, should he live to see it finish'd, he may expect to be put into some post, like Gogmagog and Co∣rineus; whether he has done any thing to de∣serve it or no. But that point must be left to the consultation and determi∣nation of the heads of the city.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="100"/>Here each little boy and girl pays <HI>Six-pence</HI> for the sight of this big Gi∣ant. He is generally seat∣ed in a great chair, suit∣ed to his bulk and digni∣ty, and ready to receive company. His dress is a rich banjan, after the Turkish mode; double breasted, and ornamented with gold, and girt round the waste with a splen∣did sash, or girdle, like
<PB N="103" REF="101"/>that of Giant <HI>Gog.</HI>'s in Guildhall: All his other habit is answerable to this, and exactly fitted to the gravity of a peaceable Giant.</P>
<P>Having enter'd <HI>Goli∣ah</HI>'s apartment, paid obei∣sance to his Giant Ma∣jesty, and survey'd him a little time sitting, he be∣gins to rouse; for he ge∣nerally seems drowsy; which we may impute to
<PB N="104" REF="102"/>illness: he fills a glass of wine, and drinks to him∣self, (for if any of the company are minded to drink with him, they must send for their bottle.) He then rises up, and surprizes all spectators with his great heighth and bigness. And hav∣ing stalk'd backwards and forwards in his room, half a dozen turns, and entertain'd the company
<PB N="105" REF="103"/>with a song, in a voice as loud as the great pipe of a large organ, and in a tune like <HI>Tidde-doll over his gingerbread;</HI> he drinks another glass, and perhaps another, if he fancies it. Then he shews how high he can reach; answers ci∣vil questions, and suffers some parts of his body to be measur'd; and these are the chief exploits he performs, excepting it be
<PB N="106" REF="104"/>to snuff a candle, or to let a fart.</P>
<P>His heighth was eight foot, four inches; and the bigness of his body and limbs was once in just proportion. But now his legs are gouty and ill sha∣pen; his knees knock to∣gether; his body bowed, that it seems painful for him to stretch, or raise himself up. His head likewise hung down, and
<PB N="107" REF="105"/>his cheeks are pinched; his looks fickly, and all his parts greatly wasted. His hands and fingers are very long and slender; his feet and toes the same.</P>
<P>He is now thirty three years of age, and has been done growing about eight.</P>
<P>I have now, my young readers, given you the state and way of life of this gigantick young man,
<PB N="108" REF="106"/>who for the sake of a lit∣tle lucre has destroy'd his health, wanting air and exercise. Whereas with a proper use of his parts, and due care, he might have liv'd to have been an old robust Giant, and descended to his grave loaden with honours and renown; as the brave Giants of old time.</P>
<P>And it was in order to prevent his being utterly
<PB N="109" REF="107"/>ten to the world, as also to oblige my young read∣ers, that I have been at the pains to publish this gigantick <HI>History of his Life;</HI> and I doubt not but I shall be as hand∣somely rewarded for it, as I was for writing that of the two Giants my worthy next neighbours, old Gogmagog and Cori∣neus.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="108"/>He is now attended by physicians and surgeons; and is in such a dange∣rous way, as seems to forebode a speedy dissolu∣tion.</P>

<P><HI>A story of the Giant's going to see a review; his be∣ing made an ensign in the army; and how be quitted his colours.</HI></P>
<P>AS I would no ways derogate from our Giant's reputation for exploits in war, I think myself oblig'd to relate a
<PB N="112" REF="110"/>story I have lately heard, tho' I cannot attest the truth of it. It is this:</P>
<P>There being a review of the troops assembled in Finland, the Giant was perswaded by some of his acquaintance to go to see it. The handsome ap∣pearance the officers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> made, was much admired by all that saw them. This fine sight so well pleased <HI>Cajanus</HI> (for so we may
<PB N="113" REF="111"/>now call him, as he is his own master again) that he accepted of an ensign's place, on promise, that if he disliked a soldier's life, he should be at liberty to quit the service.</P>
<P>He being measured, cloath'd and arm'd, enter'd into present pay; but he stalk'd about very awkard∣ly in his new equipments, and seldom in his proper place.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="112"/><HI>Cajanus</HI>'s brother offi∣cers soon perceiv'd, that tho' he was of a great bulk, he wanted courage; on which account he could do but little good in the front of an army, except∣ing to look big, and to help scare an enemy that did not know him. But the front was a post that great <HI>Goliah</HI> could by no means like, except at a re∣view, and in time of peace.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="113"/>In short, even the com∣mon soldiers took upon them to make game of this tall ensign, nay, challeng'd and affronted him conti∣nually; knowing he had not the heart to resent it.</P>
<P>After a little time, a ru∣mour was spread, that the Russians were arming, de∣signing to drive the Swedes out of Finland.</P>
<P>Upon this news, some of the young officers, who
<PB N="116" REF="114"/>look'd so gay at the re∣view, fell sick; others sold, or flung up their commissions. <HI>Cajanus,</HI> for his part, neither ask'd leave to quit, nor try'd to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ell, but threw down his flag, and got away in the night as fast as he could.</P>

<P><HI>How the Giant went to visit</HI> Gogmagog <HI>and</HI> Corineus <HI>in Guildhall.</HI></P>
<P>IT happen'd that during the time this mighty <HI>Swedish</HI> Giant was his own master, he was pre∣sented with the <HI>Gigantick History of the two famous Giants in Guildhall, Lon∣don;</HI>
<PB N="118" REF="116"/>at the sight of which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is impossible to express his surprize and delight: But upon hearing it read, his countenance fell; and he was much alarm'd, lest he should not appear to great a curiosity, as he would fain make the world believe. He was inform'd that they were Giants of nice honour, but no ways quarrelsome, unless they were first affronted. Up∣on
<PB N="119" REF="117"/>this, he resolved to make them a visit in a private manner, to see if he could discern any linea∣ments of his ancestors or kindred in their faces. Accordingly, he squeez'd himself into a coach, sit∣ting almost double, and drove close to Guildhall. As he enter'd the great door, he had presently the satisfaction of seeing, and paying obeisance to Gog∣magog
<PB N="120" REF="118"/>and Corineus, those two brave old city champions. He was some∣what abash'd at the fierce∣ness of their looks, their warlike habits, and state∣ly deportment; in which he saw nothing that was akin to himself. The two old Giants stood stiff to their posts, taking very little notice of him; he appearing to them more like the ghost of a Giant
<PB N="121" REF="119"/>than any thing else: and tho' he came just about twelve a-clock, as if he expected an invitation to dinner, when they stepp'd down; he was entirely disappointed if he did: perhaps they might have but short commons that day; or might judge by his looks, that he would with much more intre∣pidity attack a sheep than he would a lion.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="120"/>The people began to gather about the strange Giant from all parts of the Hall; but he, not caring to be star'd at too much, strides gently up to the Booksciler's, next the Gi∣ants, look'd at his books, then turns himself round, and without saying one word, takes two or three colossus strides across the Hall, into the coach, and away he goes: the people
<PB N="123" REF="121"/>gazing after him, as if they had seen the apparition of some Giant, which has been said to happen before their death.</P>
<P>Now methinks I hear the Giant, upon hearing this read to him, mutter in broken English, <HI>A lye! A lye! A lye!</HI> Be that as it will; the next time he comes to Guildhall without giving notice, he will be in danger of being squeez'd into <HI>Little-ease.</HI></P>
