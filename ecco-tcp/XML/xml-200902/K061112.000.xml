<HEAD>TO THE REV. — BALL, OF WINFRITH, NEAR WEYMOUTH.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN I rambled into Dorsetshire in the summer of 1791, my only introduction to your acquaintance was your own frank affability, and my sole recommendation to your hospitable roof, that I was a stranger. By your good-natured politeness, my mind was cheered in the solitudes of Lulworth, and by your many friendly and kind offices I was furnished with informa∣tion in a place where all was novelty,
<PB REF="4"/>though my first charm there was the certainty of what I had supposed to be common in England, a pious and be∣nevolent clergyman; and though I could, previous to my visits at Win∣frith, boast the honour of having stood before the great gates of a bishop's palace; yet, for the comforts I there enjoyed in the little parlour of a country parsonage-house, accept this trifling testimony of well-remembered goodness to,</P>

<L>DREAD censors! by whose nod we sink or rise!</L>
<L>Be merry, pray, to-night, and not too wise!</L>
<L>Our bard will smile at the strict critic rule,</L>
<L>He had his learning in a laughing—school.</L>
<L>Order, and ancient laws, he dares neglect;</L>
<L>And rather would be pleasant, than correct;</L>
<L>Nay, spite of all grave classical communities,</L>
<L>Wou'd sooner make you laugh than keep the unities.</L>
<L>Mirth is his aim—and critics! we implore you,</L>
<L>Relax, while our light scenes we lay before you!</L>
<L>Good-humour to the countenance adds graces,</L>
<L>Unbend the iron muscles of your faces!</L>
<L>Lay acid wisdom by; think mirth no sin;</L>
<L>Throw your sour dignity aside,—and grin!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet tho' we laugh we won'd not quit the grounds</L>
<L>Where sportive nature marks her ample bounds:</L>
<L>Various her range! calm, gay, then in the vapours—</L>
<L><HI>We</HI> catch the goddess while she's cutting capers.</L>
<L>To prove that we have caught her in the act,</L>
<L>Our Hermitage is built upon <HI>a fact.</HI></L>
<L>If, then, the drama's frolic pencil draws</L>
<L>A frolic fact—away with critic laws!</L>
<L>And grant the sketcher's fancy your applause!</L>
<L>Oft has he drawn before—this shop is full</L>
<L>With touches from his hand; and none thought dull;</L>
<L>Should this, to-night, seem vapid to your eyes,</L>
<L>'Twould prove a <HI>Dis</HI>-Agreeable Surprize—</L>
<L>Oh! think on his collection now in store,</L>
<L>And smile on him, on whom you smil'd before!</L>

<P>Whimmy! who's he? You can't conceive what a variety of high—low—jack—and game, since the morning we parted at the Shakespeare, you in a post-chaise for Dover. I in a phaeton for New-market, just run a horse at Blandford—lost—best of the fun, I'm at this moment a prisoner in the King's Bench.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>YOUNG PRANKS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why you may suppose, George, that my expences far exceeded my uncle's allowance—thought to help out by a lucky hit now and then, so bought a blood mare, had her put in training, then entered for the plate at Blandford—a beautiful thing—the crack of the caurse—but before the meeting, a few positive mechanical rascals thrust me into the King's Bench—must go to Blandford though, so procured the rules, and in hopes the turf could bring me in money enough to pay my debts, off I spank'd for Dorset∣shire, and, spite of informers, appeared on the course. The opinion seemed all in favour of my mare; but, like a cursed green horn, I withdrew her from the plate, and made a by-match to run her against Lord Skelter's sour-crout, to ride ourselves—but after the first round, my infernal groom told me I carried too much weight, slung part away, came in first; but my Lord insisting on our being again weighed, I was too light by a pound and an half, so that though I won, I lost the race; two hun∣dred to my Lord; in short, every guinea of a full

<P>Sir, I now see your goodness; but had I even be∣fore known it, I cou'd not have enjoy'd the blessing you design'd for me, at the expence of a friend's happiness. Mr. Peregrine has love and merit.—I admire, but don't deserve the lady.</P>

<P>Why, she's daughter to the Red Lion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>OLD PRANKS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, my honest landlord, that reliev'd the suf∣ferers, while you were swallowing peaches in Decem∣ber, and the poor shivering in cold and nakedness. Red Lion, Dick! where honour's derived from be∣nevolence; she's daughter to a nobleman. What say you, my girl?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>KITTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Only, Sir, that my heart is fill'd with gratitude; but you must ask the Red Lion's consent; for tho' you were a husband for a queen, I wou'd not have a prince, if it might grieve an indulgent parent.</P>

<SPEAKER>TULLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Only this devout preacher walks into Mr. Barley∣corn's and crams himself like a great fowl; then walks off without discharging his shot; when ask'd, says he, you'll be paid above, and says Mr. Barley∣corn, by who there? and says he, why by Abdiel; so they walk'd up stairs to me, where I was taking a pint and a whiff of tobacco. I was christen'd Mr. Tull<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪ so I walks down—but who ever saw an angel with a pipe in his mouth?

<P>Then, my dear uncle, I take my lovely Kitty Bar∣leycorn, and whilst her gentle qualities convince our friends, that birth and rank are not necessary to con∣stitute an amiable wife, my respect for her virtues may prove, that the thoughtless prodigal can make a good husband.</P>

<P>Oh! I'm happy! ha! ha! ha! We've all got so very generous.
