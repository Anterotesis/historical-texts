<P>I Tell thee, I am satisfy'd, I'm in Love enough to be suspicious of every Body.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>San.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet methinks, Sir, you should leave me out.</P>

<P>It may be so; I can't tell: but I'm not at Ease. If they don't make a Knave, at least they'll make a Fool of thee.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>San.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't believe a Word on't: But good faith, Master▪ your Love makes somewhat of you; I don't know what 'tis; but methinks when you suspect me, you don't seem <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Man of half those Parts I us'd to take you for. Look i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> my Face, 'tis round and comely, not one hollow Line of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Villain in it: Men of my Fabrick don't use to be suspecte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for Knaves; and when you take us for Fools, we never tak<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> you for wise men. For my Part, in this present Case, I tak<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> myself to be mighty deep. A Stander-by, Sir, sees more than a Gamester. You are pleas'd to be jealous of your poo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Mistress without a Cause, she uses you but too well, in my humble Opinion; she sees you, and talks with you, till I am quite tir'd on't sometimes; and your Rival that you are so
<PB N="2" REF="4"/>scar'd about, forces a Visit upon her, about once in a Fort∣night.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Car.</SPEAKER>
<P>Alas, thou art ignorant in these Affairs: He that's the civill'st receiv'd is often the least car'd for: Women ap∣pear warm to one, to hide a Flame for another. Lorenzo in short appears too compos'd of late to be a rejected Lover, and the Indifference he shews upon the Favours I seem to re∣ceive from her, poisons the Pleasure I else should taste in them, and keeps me upon a perpetual Rack. No—I would fain see some of his jealous Transports, have him fire at the Sight o'me, contradict me whenever I speak, affront me wherever he meets me, challenge me, fight me—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>San.</SPEAKER>
<P>—Run you thro' the Guts.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Car.</SPEAKER>
<P>But he's too calm, his Heart's too much at Ease, to leave me mine at Rest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>San.</SPEAKER>
<P>For my Part, Master, I'm not so great a Philosopher as you be, nor (thank my Stars) so bitter a Lover, but what I see—that I generally believe; and when Jacinta tells me she loves me dearly, I have good Thoughts enough of my Person never to doubt the Truth on't. See, here the Baggage comes.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> Jacinta, <HI>with a Letter.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<P>Hist! Jacinta! my Dear.</P>

</SP>
<STAGE>Shewing him.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jacin.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, Sir, I'm glad I have found you at last; I be∣lieve I have travell'd five Miles after you, and could neither find you at home, nor in the Walks, nor at Church, nor at the Opera, nor—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>San.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nor any where else, where he was not to be found; if you had look'd for him where he was, 'twas ten to one but you had met with him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jacin.</SPEAKER>
<P>I had, Jack-a-dandy!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Car.</SPEAKER>
<P>But prithee, what's the Matter? Who sent you after me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jac.</SPEAKER>
<P>One who's never well but when she sees you, I think; 'twas my Lady.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Car.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Jacinta, I fain would flatter myself, but am not able; the Blessing's too great to be my Lot: Yet 'tis
<PB N="3" REF="5"/>not well to trifle with me; how short soe'er I am in other Merit, the Tenderness I have for Leonora claims something from her Generosity; I should not be deluded.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jacin.</SPEAKER>
<P>And why do you think you are? methinks she's pretty well above board with you, what must be done more to satisfy you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>San.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Lorenzo must hang himself, and then we are content.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jacin.</SPEAKER>
<P>How! Lorenzo!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>San.</SPEAKER>
<P>If less will do, he'll tell you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jacin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, you are not mad, Sir, are you? Jealous of him! Pray which Way may this have got into your Head? I took you for a Man of Sense before.—Is this your Do∣ings. Log?</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>To</HI> Sancho.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>San.</SPEAKER>
<P>No forsooth, Pert, I'm not much given to Suspi∣cion, as you can tell, Mrs. Forward—If I were, I might find more Cause, I guess, than your Mistress has given our Master here. But I have so many pretty Thoughts of my own Person, Housewife, more than I have of yours, that I stand in dread of no Man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jacin.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's the Way to prosper; however, so far I'll confess the Truth to thee; at least if that don't do, nothing else will, Men are mighty simple in Love-matters, Sir: When you suspect a Woman's falling off, you fall a plaguing her to bring her on again, attack her with Reason, and a sour Face: Udslife, Sir, attack her with a Fiddle, double your good Humour—give her a Ball—powder your Periwig at her, —let her cheat you at Cards a little, and I'll warrant all's right again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Car.</SPEAKER>
<P>Say no more; I have been to blame, but there shall be no more on't.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jacin.</SPEAKER>
<P>I should punish you but justly however for what's past, if I carry'd back what I have brought you; But I'm good natur'd, so here 'tis; open it, and see how wrong you tim'd your Jealousy.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER><HI>Car.</HI> reads.</SPEAKER>
<LETTER>
<P>If you love me with that Tenderness, you have made me long believe you do, this Letter will be wel∣come; 'tis to tell you, you have Leave to plead a Daugh∣ter's
<PB N="4" REF="6"/>Weakness to a Father's Indulgence? and if you pre∣vail with him to lay his Commands upon me, you shall be as happy as my Obedience to them can make you.</P>

</SP>
<STAGE>Giving her his Ring Watch and Purse.</STAGE>

<P>Well, dear Jacinta, say something to your charming Mistress, that I am not able to say myself: But above all, excuse my late unpardonable Folly, and offer her my Life to expiate my Crime.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jacin.</SPEAKER>
<P>The best Plea for Pardon will be never to repeat the Fault.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Car.</SPEAKER>
<P>If that will do, 'tis seal'd for ever.</P>

<P>Sir, your Servant; I ask your Pardon, but I was going—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Car.</SPEAKER>
<P>I guess where; but you need not be shy of me any more, thy Master and I are no longer Rivals, I have yielded up the Cause; the Lady will have it so, so I sub∣mit.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lop.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is it possible, Sir? Shall I then live to see my Mas∣ter and you Friends again?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>San.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; and what's better, thou and I shall be Friends too. There will be no more Fear of Christian Bloodshed, I give thee up Jacinta; she's a slippery Housewife, so Master and I are going to match ourselves elsewhere.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lop.</SPEAKER>
<P>But is it possible, Sir, your Honour should be in Ear∣nest? I'm afraid you're pleas'd to be merry with your poor humble Servant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Car.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'm not at present much dispos'd to Mirth, my In∣difference in this Matter is not so thoroughly foem'd; but my Reason has so far master'd my Passion, to shew me 'tis in vain to pursue a Woman whose Heart is already another's. 'Tis what I have so plainly seen of late, I have rouz'd my Resolution to my Aid, and broke my Chains for ever.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lop.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Sir, to be plain with you, this is the joyfullest News I have heard this long Time; for I always knew you to be a mighty honest Gentleman, and good Faith it often went to the Heart o'me to see you so abused. Dear, dear, have I often said to myself (when they have had a private Meeting just after you have been gone—</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lop.</SPEAKER>
<P>I say I have said to myself, what wicked Things are Women, and what Pity it is they should be suffer'd in a
<PB N="6" REF="8"/>Christian Country; what a Shame they should be allow'd to play Will-in-the-Wisp with Men of Honour, and lead them through Thorns and Briars and Rocks, and rugged Ways, till their Hearts are torn in Pieces, like an old Coat in a Fox∣Chace? I say, I have said to myself—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Car.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thou hast said enough to thyself, but say a little more to me: Where were these secret Meetings thou talk'st of?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lop.</SPEAKER>
<P>In sundry Places, and by divers Ways; sometimes in the Cellar, sometimes in the Garret, sometimes in the Court, sometimes in the Gutter; but the Place where the Kiss of Kisses was given was—</P>

<SPEAKER>Lop.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir; I see I have been led into a Snare; I have said too much.</P>

<P>And yet thou must say more; nothing can lessen my Torment, but a farther Knowledge of what causes my Mise∣ry. Speak then; Have I any Thing to hope?</P>

<P>Nothing; but that you may be a happier Batchelor, than my Master may probably be a married Man.</P>

<P>YOU see me as much enrag'd at it, as you are yourself, yet my Brain is roving after the Cause, for something there must be; never Letter was receiv'd by Man with more Passion and Transport; I was almost as charming a Goddess as yourself, only for bringing it.

<P>Nothing cou'd pass worth my enquiring after, since nothing cou'd happen that can excuse his Usage of me; he had a Letter under my Hand which own'd him Master of my Heart; and till I contradicted it with my Mouth, he ought not to doubt the Truth on't.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Nay I confess, Madam, I ha'nt a Word to say for him, I'm afraid he's but a Rogue at bottom, as well as my Shameless that attends him; we are bit, by my Troth, and haply well enough serv'd, for listning to the glib Tongues of the Rascals.</P>

<P>Yes; she saluted me with half-a-score Rogues and Rascals too. I think our Destinies are much alike, Sir: And o'my Conscience, a couple of scurvy Jades we are hamper'd with.</P>

<P>She might, methinks, thro' this profound Respect, observe a Flame another would have cherish'd; she might support me against groundless Fears, and save me from a Ri∣val's Tyranny; she might release me from these cruel Racks, and wou'd, no doubt, if she cou'd, love as I do.</P>

<P>True, we are Men, boo—Come, Master, let us both be in a Passion; here's my Scepter, <STAGE>(Showing a Cudgel)</STAGE> Subject Jacinta, look about you. Sir, was you ev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r in Mus∣covy? the Women there love the Men dearly; why? be∣cause— <STAGE>(Shaking his Stick)</STAGE> there's your Love-powder for you. Ah, Sir, were we but wise and stout, what Work shou'd we make with them; But this humble Love making spoils them all. A rare Way indeed to bring Matters about with them; we are persuading them all Day they are Angels and Goddesies, in Order to use them at Night like human Creatures; we are like to succeed truly.</P>

<P>For my Part, I never yet cou'd bear a Slight from any Thing, nor will I now. There's but one Way however to resent it from a Woman; and that's to drive her bravely from your Heart, and place a worthier in her vacant Throne.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>San.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now with Submission to my Betters, I have another Way, Sir, I'll drive my Tyrant from my Heart, and place myself in her Throne. Yes; I will be Lord of my own Tenement, and keep my Houshold in Order. Wou'd you, wou'd do so too, Master; for, look you, I have been Ser∣vitour in a College at Salamancha, and read Philosophy with the Doctors; where I found that a Woman, in all Times, has been observ'd to be an Animal hard to understand, and much inclin'd to Mischief. Now as an Animal is always an Animal, and a Captain always a Captain, so a Woman is al∣ways a Woman: Whence it is that a certain Greek says, her Head is like a Bank of Sand; or, as another, a solid Rock; or, according to a third, a dark Lanthorn. Pray, Sir, observe, for this is close Reasoning; and so as the Head is the Head of the Body; and that the Body without a Head, is like a Head without a Tail; and that where there is neither Head nor Tail, 'tis a very strange Body: So I say a Woman is by Comparison, do you see (for nothing explains things like Comparisons) I say by Comparison, as Aristotle has often said before me, one may compare her to the raging Sea; for as the Sea, when the Wind rises, knits its Brows like an angry Bull, and that Waves mount upon Rocks, and Rocks mount upon Waves; that Porpusses leap like Trouts, and Whales skip about like Gudgeons; that Ships roll like Beer Barrels, and Mariners pray like Saints; just so, I say, a Woman—A Woman, I say, just so, when her Reason is shipwreck'd upon her Passion, and the Hulk of her Understanding lies thump, thump, thumping against the Rock of her Fury; then it is, I say, that by certain Immotions, which —um—cause, as one may suppose, a sort of Convul∣sive—yes—hurricanious—um—like—in short, a Woman is like the Devil. But here come the Cro∣codiles to weep us into Mercy.</P>
