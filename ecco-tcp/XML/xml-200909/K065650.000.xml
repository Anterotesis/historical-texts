<HEAD>SUNDAY. OPENS the SCENE.</HEAD>
<P>FOR ever sacred to TRANQUILLITY! —sweet rural scenes, where CON∣TEMPLATION sits, and meditates on God's benevolence!</P>
<P>RETIREMENT plaud the poets peace∣ful seat, with hands of grave HUMILITY, forbidding OSTENTATIONS steps, PRIDE'S arrogance, or fickle TASTE to tread her hallow'd bounds.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="3"/>Hither!—O hither come, sweet social SCIENCE; leading on CONTENTMENT with countenance serene!—here hand in hand let MEDITATION walk with grave MORALITY—whilst IGNORANCE with con∣tumelious look, averts her rustic foot, and tells an aukward tale to ENVY and her sister fiends, who minister in her un∣letter'd reign.</P>
<P>The varied scene of HUMAN LIFE, at once displays; on this hand, all the an∣xious grandeur of the GREAT, on that, sad INDIGENCES tears; from whence RE∣FLECTION turns with a sigh, and by her just comparisons, disposes all my mind to GRATITUDE.—</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="4"/>—Hail MEDIOCRITY! thou blest estate, depart not from thy happy votary!— seated on the centre of PLEASURES wheel, safe from AMBITIONS giddy flights and POVERTY'S depression, thou ensures me PEACE.</P>
<P>For this RETREAT, I leave the busy Town, where TRAFFICK, with a brow be∣set with cares, and shoulders bending to the burthen, walks Adventures restless mazes and her labyrinths of Hope—on whose hard indefatigable heel, full of∣ten sullen DISAPPOINTMENT treads, whilst from her meagre visage she rubs the sickly sweat with rags disconsolate—or if
<PB N="4" REF="5"/>
attended by some better fate, perchance comes sportive LUCK in steps fantastick, and with prosperity rewards the Toils of TRADE: relieves INDUSTRY'S soul of doubtfulness, yet teints the jaundic'd eye with AVARICE, and gives another countenance to CARE.</P>
<P>Away, away ATTENTION! hither haste, to rove the Sylvan scene, the plain, the valley, and the grove: leave the dull haunts of mercenary men, and gains in∣satiable gaze, to court the smiles of ru∣ral INNOCENCE, and catch the living Virtues as they rise—peruse the flow'ry page of NATURE'S book, and reaping
<PB N="5" REF="6"/>
WISDOM with the arms of scientific pleasure, soar aloft, and breath thy ado∣ration to the GOD OF ALL.</P>
<P>There stands the COTT, where fancy strays A WEEK, and gathers up the beauties of the scene.</P>
<P>On elevated ground erected, it com∣mands extensive PROSPECTS, stretching every way: placed on the skirts of a small VILLAGE, where lofty Sycamores, with spreading boughs, dispense their shade around its tenements—beneath the leafy covert, oft at ease, the Peasant fits sagacious, musing on the ev'ning clouds, as weather-wise—there the rus∣tic
<PB N="6" REF="7"/>
Damsel, loit'ring in the day-fall gloom, communes with tell-tale inti∣mates; describing LOVE, so natural and naked, that each fond confidant, with sympathetic Sighs, salutes the well dis∣cover'd passion; whilst each stands wish∣ing, panting, and on fire—there too at seasons, sits the Matron of the Village, whose wrinkled brow confesses Age, but yet denies severity: for as she bends her weaken'd sight, upon the polish'd nee∣dles whilst she knits, she courts facetious prattle from the Babes, who pull the pansies on the green; and smiles to hear them lisp their Granny's tale, and imi∣tate her prayer.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="8"/>Surrounded with a shadowy grove, the RUINS of an ABBY, lift their solemn fronts, and shew their bending arches—in the distracted pomp of wasting columns, tot'ring walls, and gasping windows, all the havoc of infatuated zeal, stands cha∣racteriz'd: whilst in widow-weeds of mantling Ivy, sage RELIGION sits, and mourns the desolation of her house, and the sad sins of her degenerate Sons.</P>
<P>There the Groves of R—k—by stretching round her park, o'ertop the wall—sweet scenes of Rural ease and Ele∣gance—where G—A flying from the heathy mountains, precipitates her streams from rock to rock, 'till in the
<PB N="8" REF="9"/>
bosom of exulting T—s, the river Nymph resigns her auburn tresses, and nutbrown charms, in murmurs o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> soft extacy and Love—high hanging woods repeat the sounds, mix'd with the plaintive voice of amorous Doves who coo their tale of jealousy for every absent mate—</P>
<P>—Here Nature with dignity sublime, excells the works of Art, and forms a so∣lemn walk, where massive rocks, with august Columns prop the oaken grove, that hangs upon their tow'ring Cliffs— the far projecting trees, spread wide their boughs, and give a leafy Canopy▪ umbriferous; forming a scene, whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="9" REF="10"/>
where WISDOM would delight to con∣template, where MEDITATION met with PIETY, would hold their holy converse; and sage PHILOSOPHY would sit unseen, to study Nature—once made the haunt of sad DISSATISFACTIONS gloomy steps, where MELANCHOLY measured out her pensively reiterated Walk—there un∣redeeming R—k—by often stray'd, to meditate on the forlorn fate of his pa∣ternal Lands—there too projecting R—b—n hath sat, to see his sweet De∣mesnes, from his unfeeling genius, transform'd to Stone; to plan the proud devouring Edifice, which swallow'd up these fertile fields, and all this paradise
<PB N="10" REF="11"/>
—now M—TT is thy Lord, whose elegance of Taste, is with the zone of PRUDENCE girt, and whose provident sa∣gacity engrafts DESCRETION on his PLEASURES.</P>
<P>Near to thy streams O G—A, once the Praefect lay of fam'd SOLENCES, and the plain was burthen'd with a Roman Host—oft in thy waters have the He∣roes laved their valarous Limbs, and oft along thy channel stray'd, delighted with fertility—here too the Altar blaz'd to festive CERES, and the Grove re∣sounded with the rights of PAN—</P>
<P>—to them another Host succeeded,
<PB N="11" REF="12"/>
usurp'd their Lustrals and their Altars, and pitch'd their Tent on M—R—NS plains; to foster foreign Piety in these rich Lands—the fair Exotic ask'd for happy vales, where Nature lavish'd her luxuriancy: the mountain and the rock, where in the days of Yore, the Sage had sought the presence of his God, the gloomy Forest, and the dark damp Cave, were not befitted to her soft Italian Con∣stitution.</P>
<P>Too long my Pen, dwells on thy scenes OR—K—BY, whilst other objects wait my Muse—where T—PE in rural
<PB N="12" REF="13"/>
opulence surmounts the Hill, and to the Eastern sun extends its golden meads.—</P>
<P>—beneath whose feet, deep in the silent and sequester'd Dale, a friend to Science lives, a letter'd Sage; devoted to Tranquillity and sacred Truth: where pious W—K—FF, once convers'd with God.</P>
<P>Wide spreading Groves, and deep em∣bow'ring shades, wrap up in solemn stillness T—L'S Mansion—where the dis∣contented Genius of the Glades, sits sigh∣ing for the absence of her Lord; who from her haunts, estranges science and Philosophy, the Muses and the Graces;
<PB N="13" REF="14"/>
and carries them as Captives, far from his long deserted Lands.</P>
<P>Those lines of dusky Pines, which mark D—N—'S rich Demesnes, shut up the prospect.</P>
<P>There, thro' an Arch of Boughs, the elevated Fane of K—Y strikes the eye, and gives its sacred Tower, to form a noble distant Obelisk.—</P>
<P>—And here, the woody banks of B-R-G-M, are bent up to the mountains brow; where M—K still inherits the Pa∣trician Virtues, and marks the ways of Life with such benevolence, as purchas'd for his Ancestors, immortal Love.—</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="15"/>—Still nearer lie the Lands of E—N where cultivation with a comely counte∣nance, sits smiling in its youth; and makes abash'd the neighbouring hills; where Nature sleeps in native russet, wrap'd in indolence and barrenness— where H—E forlorn, creeps from the gloomy mountains side, and hides its clay-built Cottages—from whence a winding way is mark'd aloft, ascending to the summit of the steep; conducting to the golden regions and the Mines of Patriotic T—R, and Paternal S—, whose knees benevolent, are crowded with his Childrens Children.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="16"/>The SOUTHERN PROSPECT calls for my Attention.—</P>
<P>—the nearest object is the TOWN OF B—, where on the hanging steep, the streets extend, and pour their Thousands forth.—</P>
<P>—There on the Cliff a ruin'd CASTLE stands, and frowns, impending o'er the foaming streams, where T—s precipi∣tates his noisy floods, and drives his frighted Neiades from the scene of Hor∣ror—ghastly and wild the disconcert∣ed Walls stand sullenly, and brave the wrath of Time—gloomy and dark their aspect, as the Age, in which the Scottish founder form'd his Plan, and labour'd

up these Bulwarks, and this mass of stone —the work of Vassalage—once the seat of Slavery and arbitrary sway—in after Ages, made the holds of curs'd Rebellion and a thousand Crimes—now left the monument of Tyranny expir'd, and great in Ruins, tells the Age of Liberty restor'd—become an object now fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> PLEASURES Eye, augustly reverent, thy Ivy mantled arches, shatter'd walls and rifted Towers, thy nodding Battle∣ments, now domineer not, but adorn the Place.—</P>
<P>—Rich in Meadows, with hangin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Woods and scenes of Pleasure girt, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> B—, thou art highly favour'd of the

<PB N="18" REF="19"/>
of the few, who struggle by example to envigorate the fainting VIRTUES— where H—K, for fraternal Love and filial Piety rever'd, teacheth the delights of doing good.</P>
<P>Beyond the Town, on rising ground, the mansion of the Sons of ISRAEL stands; commanding to the East, a vary'd Pro∣spect, full of Beauties—Woods which deck the Rivers banks—bright broad Canals and flow'ry Vales, o'ertop'd by HAMILTON'S high sky ting'd hills—thy Lord excells in his Paternal Duty and hospitable Board, famed for the Chastity
<PB N="19" REF="20"/>
of each excentric Toast, that flows su∣perior to his Military habits.—</P>
<P>Adjoining, on a grassy brow, a Church is seen, whose humble architec∣ture, (not debasing divine Worship,) re∣tains this Christian maxim, that pure RE∣LIGION, dwells in Simplicity—the gawdy robe, the gilded fane, are ostentations own, in which Hypocrisy is seen to sit— PRIDE is religions profanation, and arro∣gance in her Priests is Blasphemy—the Villagers crowd the Tombstones, and thoughtless o'er the dead, their rustic Jests propound, or Love-tales whisper; till THE HOLY MAN, in Robes of White,
<PB N="20" REF="21"/>
Religions Emblem, and the Type of In∣nocence, convokes the giddy Herd, and with his doctrines, lulls them to repose— —beneath the Hill, the hasty river falls in hoarse cascades, and as it laves the sounding shores, yields a loud plaudit to its bounteous Author; whilst the leap∣ing floods, exulting clap their Hands— all on the verdant steep, the green turf marks the Peasant's grave, where many an honest heart has fled from woe, and yielding up the spirit to its God, sleeps in a Mother's lap serene—there in the verdant mantle, many a Maid hath wrap'd her Cares, hath hush'd her wishes for the
<PB N="21" REF="22"/>
world, and given an Angel to the Skies.</P>
<P>On the gently rising hills behind, the Hamlets stand, diversifying the extended Prospect—there B—N scatters out her Cottages, crouching beneath the smoak of burning Lime, that clouds the sultry Sun, with its expanding volumes—and here the dusty road leads up to B—S, beat by the feet of Travellers, and at the instant of my observation, crowded with Cattle, and a flock of Sheep, which, from the washpool bleat, and shake their stripping Fleeces—B—S once of Ro∣man fame, lifts up her ruin'd Tower in

<P>The western View courts my descrip∣tion,—where just beneath this seat, the T—S expands his shining bosom to the

day, and in one long extended Lake, re∣flects the waving Woods, and flow'ry Meads, which make his margin gay— a little further L—N attempts to hide her humble Village with her Trees; ex∣cept where M—S old hospitable Man∣sion stands, divested of the Insignia of its woe, forbearing now to mourn for her departed Lord, bless'd in the Virtue of his Heir.—</P>

<P>—At the conflux of the Rivers, on a Rocky eminence, the Ruins of FITZ HENRY'S CASTLE stand, assuming still <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he sullen frown of Feudal Tyranny; a mimikry of antient insolence and sway, unhallow'd as the Templars arms which girt her arbitrary Lord.</P>
<P>Far as the Eye can reach, up B—R'S dreary dale, the sable Huts of H—N—R—TE are scatter'd, skirting the Desart; descrip∣tive to the view, of CAIN'S sad Camp within the Land of Nod, exil'd of Eden, and accurs'd of Heaven.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="27"/>Deep in the Vale lies moping R—K, which like DESPONDENCY retires to gloomy walks and secret shades, to ru∣minate upon her unpropitious History— yet there A MAN resides, who, with a Taste refin'd, a Mind that's polish'd with the polite Arts, and disciplin'd in Eru∣dition's School, neglects the gayest scene; of Human life, and MEDITATION courts, in these her most sequester'd haunts; his daily pleasure to instruct Mankind, that SACRED RULES and SOCIAL VIRTUES are the same.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="28"/>Beneath yon mountain's Brow, stands E—N, and spreads her white front to the Western Sun: under whose foot, flows long-lamenting T—S; in murmurs mourning for his PRINCE deceas'd—over whose Tomb attir'd in HONOURS garb, in Tears A BROTHER stands, inscribes his Urn with Characters of Love, and saves his Memory.</P>
<P>Northward I turn, and o'er the Pas∣ture Land, where crowds of Cattle crown the Hill, and court the Breeze, stands W—Z on her woody Banks; whilst all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ove are seen the Royal chace of M—D and her Parks: whose gracious PRINCE

<P>—<Q>Five little Wretches fill'd th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Nest—the Mother, in her tenderness and Care, absorb'd the Sorrows of he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Widowhood, and tasted hopes for he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> small progeny—I saw her passage to an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> fro in quest of food—I heard their Call<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and her Reply, and saw her swift retur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> when e'er their Voice express'd Cala¦mity—and when she brought th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

diet, o'er her brood with lapsing qui∣vering Wing she hung, expressing the soft feelings of her Maternal Heart.</Q>—</P>
<P>—<Q>The birds were almost fledg'd and fit for flight—the Mother's assi∣duity was ripe for a reward, and often had she thought of leading forth her infant-train to Woods and Fountains, and the World of Liberty and Joy— when from yonder Village spoiling Boys, in cruel pastime rang'd the fields, in quest of hapless tenants of the Spray—they came—they ravaged all the labours of my Wren—despoil'd her Nest, and took the young ones forth.—In human minds what early
<PB N="202" REF="203"/>
strain of Cruelty appears!—Strang<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> disposition in the heart of Man! un∣cultivated and unpruned by Learning thou wouldst give the human race t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Forests and to Dens, as barbarous an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> savage as the Tyger.</Q>—</P>
<P>—<Q>But of the Mother Wren— with food encumbred, home she cam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> exulting in the labours of her flight— she found her Nest despoil'd, and rui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> mark'd the havock made by sacrili¦gious hands, in the destruction of Widow's house—distracted she sun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> down, and in the dust expired.</Q></P>
<P>The good Man gazed on MARIANNE
<PB N="203" REF="204"/>
with Eyes brim-full of tears—and MA∣RIANNE look'd languishing and pale!—</P>
<P>—<Q>Such is my Mother's fate, for Cruelty hath laid her Iron grasp upon my Life—I loved ALCIRIS with the purest Passion, and Happiness was in our View—but CYMON, of unfeeling Soul, of Nature like the Clod he tills, he tasting only Avarice, will slay us both.</Q>—</P>
<P>—<Q>Not so fair MARIANNE, (replied ANTONIE) for fortune dawns upon thee, and OLISSUS once a Lover, now thy friend, will give thee such a portion, as shall overshadow OLD CY∣MON's
<PB N="204" REF="205"/>
rankest boddings of Ambi∣tion.</Q>—</P>
<P>—<Q>Happy the hour which gave O∣LISSUS to the World (she cried)—bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> what is wealth to me, if my ALCIRIS dies—it is but dust to sprinkle on our Tombs.</Q>—</P>
<P>The holy Man was smitten with he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Talk, for he was fearful of the young man's fate—he dared not weep, least his affliction should touch her troubled Spi∣rit with increase of Woe—he smother'd in his breast the secret Sigh.—</P>
<P>They reach'd the the House of CY∣MON.—</P>
<P><PB N="205" REF="206"/>The pious ANTHONIE conducted the sorrowing fair One to the sick Man's bed—he bow'd—he dropt a Tear, and quitted the room—the Parents now with true compunction stung, beheld the danger of their Child, and were smitten with freezing Terror and incessant grief —Self-condemnation gall'd their aching hearts, and many a fruitless Prayer they breath'd to angry Stars, for pardon of their sad Obduracy and sinful Avarice —unable to sustain the wretched scene, they both withdrew—JENNETTA only staid—and that no Vow, no Voice, might from her wicked Ear escape, fast at the sick Man's back she laid, to cut off all
<PB N="206" REF="207"/>
the tenderness which true Love's deli∣cacy, hates should bear another's Eye.—</P>
<P>Fair MARIANNE sat on her Knees close by the sick Man's bed, and in her hands clasping his hand, she pray'd— her Voice was heard by Cherubims; her virtuous Prayer was wafted up to Heaven, where Angels with a Tear repeated— SPARE HIM GOOD LORD!—</P>
<P>—With ghastly smiles the Youth's diffigured Countenance was set—the clotted blood hung in his hair—deep in their sockets sunk his languid Eyes— his lips were scorching hot—his nostrils parch'd, and in a tumult beat the blood
<PB N="207" REF="208"/>
on every Artery—the Image which she oft had gazed on with delight, how wretchedly transform'd—her looks fix'd on his looks—with tears to tears— with sighs to sighs they mourn'd their Fate in Silence.—</P>
<P>JENNETTA like a Daemon lurk'd be∣hind, and felt no impulse but invete∣racy.—</P>
<P>ALCIRIS with a languid Voice breath'd out "MY MARIANNE:" and MARIANNE With her affliction choak'd, scarce utter'd to be heard, "Alas! my dear ALCIRIS," —dreadful Grief set all her Frame in torture—aching throbs affected her head
<PB N="208" REF="209"/>
—her heart was sick—her limbs wer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> shook in burning Ague.—<Q>Indulge us, dear JENNETTA, (says ALCIRIS,) and give us but a Moment to our∣selves.</Q></P>
<P>—JENNETTA was not moved—</P>
<P>—<Q>Oh! MARIANNE, breaths out the Swain, oft interrupted by his Sighs, thy faithful Youth hath fal∣len amongst Murderers—inhuman Wretches, who rejoice in slaying every Comfort, which the heart can taste on Earth— Assassins of the Soul—Pa∣rents and Sister murdering a Son, a Brother—putting his Soul upon the

rack, and wrenching out of Joint his Spirits sensibility.—</Q></P>
<P>—<Q>Alas! ALCIRIS replies the Maid, think not that the World permits ex∣istence to such Wickedness.— I bring thee Comfort—all the bar to our fe∣licity is taken from us — to satiate thy Father's wishes, I come enrich'd—to thee I come endow'd with Virtue and the truest Love.</Q>—</P>
<P>—<Q>It is too late, cries he—the Act is perpetrated—my Death's wound has its seat within my heart; and Me∣dicine and Hope are Vanities—I love thee, MARIANNE; and if an Angel did not tell me false, we soon shall have

our Nuptials in the Tomb—ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Souls they cannot sever—After Deat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> their Tyranny cannot prevail agains<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> us.—</Q></P>
<P>—<Q>I love ALCIRIS, says MARIANNE with an equal fervor, I die with thee— I court the nuptial funeral—the joy o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> spirits is infinite—in heaven alone is Justice—is Mercy—is festivity withou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> alloy.—</Q></P>
<P>On the hand of MARIANNE he press'd his burning lips — the flutter'd spirits overcame her strength—she fainted.—</P>
<P>—JENNETTA'S screams alarmed them all without—they bore the breathless
<PB N="211" REF="212"/>
Maiden forth—the fresh air in a little time restored her strength—but appre∣hensive that such Agitation would in∣crease ALCIRIS'S Malady; they denied her re-admittance to the room.</P>
<P>Onward in the way, CYMON attends the mourning MARIANNE on her return —with silent steps she quits the Vale of Sorrow.—</P>
<P>—When left alone the wretched Maiden stray'd, in unknown paths, and wander'd in the Woods 'till Night drew on—the pale Moon from the broken Clouds, by intermissions gleam'd; and glancing through the trees, with many a
<PB N="212" REF="213"/>
shadow trim'd the solemn Grove, and many a pale shine cast; that to the frighted Eye, of fanciful dejection, of∣ten stood the semblance of sad Spectres, and the Ghost of her ALCIRIS, haunted every Glade—whilst boding birds shriek'd from the ivy'd Shade, and hooted out misfortunes dire presage.—</P>
<P>During this absence of the Maid, OLIS∣SUS to poor EMMA'S COTTAGE hasten'd, impatient to relate his knowledge of her Family.—</P>
<P>Dejected, EMMA sat, and mused upon the melancholy Scene, of which her MA∣RIANNE was then a Visitor.—</P>
<P><PB N="213" REF="214"/>—<Q>Let me salute my Sister, and my Friend,</Q> OLISSUS cries—and fell upon the astonish'd EMMA'S neck!—</P>
<P>—"What means my Lord," the Wi∣dow enclasp'd in his Arms, scarce utter'd from the strange profusion of his kisses —she trembled as he held her to his bosom.—</P>
<P>—<Q>Thy surprize, dear MATRON, is not yet arrived to its pitch (cries he) —Good EMMA, look upon me—in OLISSUS you behold, the brother of AMINTOR.</Q>—</P>
<P>—Tears dim'd the Matron's Eyes; A∣stonishment was big within her heart.—</P>
<P>—<Q>I was more fortunate than thy
<PB N="214" REF="215"/>
beloved Husband.—I was bred a Mer∣chant—to foreign Climes in early youth transported, I remained a Stranger to my father's house for forty years— when I returned, alas! my Father was no more!—his mansion and his lands were possess'd by others—your AMIN∣TOR was dead—and I (presumed the last remains of all my Family), Here fix'd my residence, in rural Ease, to take Enjoyment of the Wealth my in∣dustry acquired—the hand of Provi∣dence pointed out dear MARIANNE— her Innocence and beauty taught me Love—her History reveal'd, despoil'd

my Marriage-bed, but gave to me a Neice whom I rejoice to honour.</Q></P>
<P>—The happy Event overcame the Strength of EMMA, she was ready to ex∣pire with Joy.—</P>
<P>—OLISSUS saw the strong emotions of her Soul, in her fainting looks, and led her to the Air.—</P>
<P>—<Q>There is a rumour that your MARIANNE'S enamour'd of a merito∣rious Youth, whose avaritious Father interferes, and stays their Happiness— I'll send to CYMON and promote the Match, and with her give a dowry e∣qual to his Wishes.</Q>—</P>
<P>—<Q>Alas! my Lord, (replies EMMA)
<PB N="216" REF="217"/>
that Youth from disappointed Love lies sick; and now is visited by MA∣RIANNE.</Q>—</P>
<P>—<Q>We'll send him comfort instant∣ly (says he)—for time in Love for∣lorn, amidst the languishing of hope∣lesness, is often precious beyond Esti∣mation—we'll hasten MARIANNE's return, nor longer let her ling'ring fears prevail, but cheer her Soul with Consolation, and the knowledge of her Fortune.</Q>—</P>
<P>OLISSUS scarce had utter'd these last words, when breathless, and in haste, the fair One enter'd.—</P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="218"/>DISTRACTION stood upon her wand'r∣ing looks, and sported with her smiles— <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> little Butterfly sat on her hand, to which she held discourse, in frantick phraze regardless of OLISSUS, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hrieks of her affrighted Mother—her Cloaths were all disorder'd, and in her hair were plaited roses mix'd with Ivy leaves.—</P>
<P>—Struck with the sad disastrous Spectacle, distress'd with disappointed Views of his benevolence, OLISSUS sunk his face towards the Earth, and o'er his manly Countenance the bigh tear tum∣bled.—</P>
<P>—EMMA fell upon her Couch and hld her face.—</P>
<P><PB N="218" REF="219"/>—<Q>See here, cries MARIANNE— this little flutt'ring Insect here—it is a Butterfly you say—you see not what it is—for outward forms deceive us— Providence hath cast deception on the face of every thing—I thought O∣LISSUS was a lover once, but he's un∣masked, and stands bereft of his dis∣guise, a very Man.</Q>—</P>
<P>—<Q>Pretty little painted thing—I know full well of what thou camest, and what thou art—I saw thee in thy mortal State, a Caterpillar, breathing breath of animal Existence; and sus∣taining life with herbs and flowers.— Mankind, like thee, in this terrestrial

true Emblem of Humanity—true Emblem of the three Estates of hu∣man Race—fair Monitor for MARI∣ANNE—Preceptor, teaching confidence, of Resurrection—pointing her to Joys, of whose Attainment she already stands upon the brink.</Q>—</P>
<P>She ceas'd—OLISSUS with endearing phraze, attempted to calm her wand'r∣ing Senses—but in vain—for all was disconcerted—all was wild and wretch∣ed.—</P>
<P>—EMMA could not bear to look up∣on on her miserable Daughter—OLISSUS burst into a flood of Tears.—</P>
<P><PB N="221" REF="222"/>—Whilst witnessing her frantick fan∣cies, EMMA with OLISSUS sorrowing sat —the Solemn Sound of Death-bell, down the Vale, repeatedly knell'd— the breezes on their sighing Bosoms bore the fatal Tale—they touch'd the start∣led Ear of MARIANNE—forth from the COT she ran, to listen to the Voice which told the Mortal Tale—six'd as the Mar∣ble which adorns the Monument, with the pale Effigy of weeping VIRTUE, stood the Maid attentive, motionless, and sad.—</P>
<P>—At length she started—exclaim'd. <Q>He's gone! he's gone! ALCIRIS is no more!</Q>—</P>
<P><PB N="222" REF="223"/>—Then down she sunk, upon the dewey Flowers, and yielded up her Soul to Heaven.—</P>
