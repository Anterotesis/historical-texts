<L>The men only wore wigs; but now, with the ladies,</L>

<L>The colour they change as they please of their caxon:</L>
<L>All ranks now appear in the new-fashion'd rig, there;</L>

<L>Since damsels of fifteen throw off, as they scorn'd 'em,</L>
<L>The beautiful locks with which Nature adorn'd 'em,</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="10"/>And frizzled wigs wear, as in public they dash on;</L>
<L>Pray, why should not old men, too, follow the fashion?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And, since in the valley of years I'm declining,</L>
<L>At what can't be help'd, in the stead of repining,</L>
<L>I'll sport each new whimsy; in pantaloons strut too;</L>
<L>To my throat a huge poultice I'll presently put too:</L>
