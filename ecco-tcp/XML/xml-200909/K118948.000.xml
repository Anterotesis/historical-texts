<HEAD>COPY of a LETTER to a Mem∣ber of the SURRY Committee.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>— I Have paid all the attention, that the shortness of the time would permit, in searching and procuring authorities, to enable you to oppose the objections lately made to <HI>annual parlia∣ments,</HI> as stated in your kind letter of the 17th instant. — With respect to the first, i. e. their <Q>incompetency, now that the empire is so vast, and foreign connections so interwoven with us;</Q> I beg leave to remind you, that the empire is not now more interwoven with foreign connec∣tions, (I mean those of <HI>Europe,</HI> which a∣lone have power to affect us,) than they were when <HI>annual</HI> parliaments (and <HI>"more often if need be"</HI>) were the esta∣blished law of the land; I mean in the
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>
glorious reign of king Edward III. when <HI>several</HI> of the richest and most <HI>populous provinces of France</HI> were the hereditary dominions of the family upon the throne; and when the remainder of that mighty and extensive empire, with the exception of a very few provinces, (the great duke of Burgundy himself doing homage for his estates,) belonged absolutely to the crown of England, by the right of con∣quest. But the true constitutional an∣swer to the objection is, that all foreign dominions, acquired by the crown of England, <HI>ought to be governed by free par∣liaments of their own,</HI> duly elected by the inhabitants of each distinct country res∣pectively, who have not only the <HI>best right,</HI> but the <HI>best knowledge and abilities,</HI> how to prescribe laws for their own go∣vernment, safety, and necessities. This is the only true means of removing all dif∣ficulty from the government of <HI>distant do∣minions,</HI> because, in the first place, it is
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
the only means that is strictly consistent with the <HI>natural rights</HI> of the inhabitants in each dominion, separately considered; and also, 2dly, the only means of pre∣venting the inhabitants of such distant dominions or colonies, from invading the <HI>natural rights</HI> of <HI>each other,</HI> which is the source of civil war and disunion; and, if this most essential principle of our <HI>consti∣tution,</HI> and of <HI>natural equity,</HI> had been regarded by administration, agreeably to what I have stated, in my Declaration of the Peoples Rights, respecting <HI>Ireland,</HI> we should not have lost <HI>America!</HI> — The only true means, for instance, to preserve the British empire in <HI>East-India,</HI> which still remains to us, is, to instruct the Sooders, and lower casts of the Indian tribes, concerning their <HI>natural right to a share in the government</HI> of those coun∣tries which they inhabit, that their duly elected representatives, in a general as∣sembly, may have confidence to reject
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
and confute that detestable lie of the Bra∣mins, by which they are holden in sla∣very, and rendered the prey of Tartarian, as well as European, wolves and tigers.</P>
<P>The English company of merchants, aided by the British government, have, at present, both power and influence suf∣ficient to effect this, and restore them to their rights: this would be an obligation never to be forgotten, and which would establish trade upon its proper basis, and <HI>remove all difficulties, as well as expence, from the government of that vast empire;</HI> but, if the opportunity be too long ne∣glected, it may be suddenly lost for ever!</P>
<P>With respect to the second objection, — <Q>The apprehensions of disorder on too frequent elections.</Q> — The evidence of experience confutes it, as, I hope, I have already proved in the two little tracts, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the Legal Means of political Reformation, in two tracts, p. 31 and 32, also 55 and 56. See also the three last paragraphs of the Memorial of the Deputies from the several petitioning counties, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> wherein it is declared, concerning ANNUAL parliaments, that <Q>they were ever described as consistent with the greatest peace, and most peaceably conducted.</Q></NOTE>
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
and of which the preamble to the wicked act of the 8th of king Henry VI. is itself an ample testimony; <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The <HI>legal Means, &amp;c.</HI> p. 29, 30.</NOTE> because the per∣verters of the constitution, at that time, could not say that <Q>man-slaughter, ri∣ots, batteries, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q> had <HI>then</HI> happen∣ed, as they really <HI>do now</HI> at our <HI>septennial elections,</HI> but only in the <HI>future</HI> tense, that <HI>"they shall very likely arise and be."</HI> They could not complain, that there were a <HI>number of outrageous people</HI> at county elec∣tions, and therefore they perversely and deceitfully complained only of an <HI>outrage∣ous and excessive number of people:</HI> the epi∣thet, <HI>"outrageous,"</HI> was not applicable to the people, and therefore they have deceitfully branded the innocent substan∣tive, <HI>"number,"</HI> with the charge of being <HI>"outrageous."</HI> The reason of this is
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
plain: the manner of wording the act, as it now stands, has the effect of an in∣sinuation against the behaviour of the people, that is, to a <HI>careless reader,</HI> and thereby it answered the deceitful purpose of those who framed (or translated) the act, which would have been <HI>null and void</HI> for want of <HI>truth,</HI> had the adjective, <HI>"outrageous,"</HI> been applied to the other substantive, i. e. <HI>people;</HI> for <HI>falsehood</HI> in a preamble has the unquestionable effect of destroying the force of any statute.</P>
<P>But, if the people really were <HI>outrageous</HI> at elections, as well as <HI>excessively numerous,</HI> yet, it is certain, that they had <HI>right</HI> on their side, and intended the good of the kingdom in general; because they have the evidence of all antiquity, that the <HI>majority</HI> of these excessive numbers were generally for sending to parliament the best and most respectable men they could find among them; which is not only pro∣ved by the testimony I quoted from
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
Prynne, in p. 31 and 32 of my first little tract,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>For a</HI> more equal representation, &amp;c.</NOTE> but also by the evidence of that learned antiquarian, Browne Willis, Esq. who tells us, in the preface of his <HI>Noti∣tia parliamentaria,</HI> that <Q>the knights of shires</Q> (viz. those that were chosen by the <HI>outrageous and excessive number of peo∣ple</HI>) <Q>have, EVER, IN ALL COUNTIES, been chosen out of the principal <HI>gentry and quality:</HI> and though, says he, the citizens and burgesses were hereto∣fore elected out of their respective communities, and were only the CHIEF and MOST EMINENT MERCHANTS, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of their own communities or cor∣porate bodies; yet, in king Edward IV.'s time, we find a great many of them distinguished by titles,</Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> This affords a farther answer also to the first objection against <HI>annual</HI> parliaments.</P>
<P>For who are so fit to judge of public affairs, <Q><HI>now that the empire</HI> is so vast,
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>
and foreign connexions so interwoven with us,</Q> (according to the objector's sta∣ting,) as <Q>the principal gentry and qua∣lity</Q> out of the counties, and the <HI>"chief and most eminent merchants"</HI> out of the trading cities and boroughs? and more especially such knights, citizens, and burgesses, as those of ancient times, whose conduct in parliament procured them <HI>the honour</HI> of being <HI>annually retur∣ned,</HI> and sometimes <HI>more often,</HI> for seve∣ral years together?</P>
<P>Thus, the two first objections against <HI>annual elections</HI> are manifestly without foundation; and, with respect to the third, that <Q>it never was the law of the land,</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">So far is this objection from the <HI>truth,</HI> that the de∣puties from the several petitioning counties, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> have, in their MEMORIAL, declared, that <Q><HI>shortening the du∣ration of the sitting of parliament can only be done,</HI> CON∣SISTENTLY WITH <HI>the</HI> CONSTITUTION, <HI>or with the best policy on any enlarged view, by shortening it</HI> TO THE PERIOD OF A YEAR;</Q> and they afterwards cite the ancient acts, which ordained, that <Q>a parliament shall be holden every year once, and more often if need be.</Q></NOTE> it savours either of such deplo∣rable
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>
ignorance, or of such bare-faced falsehood and effrontery, as scarcely de∣serves an answer!</P>
<P>If I have made any error or misrepre∣sentation in either of the little tracts, let the objectors point it out, and they will not find me backward to submit to <HI>truth;</HI> for that is my duty to God and man! — But, to condemn the doctrine in the lump, without deigning to give a single reason or proof against it, though it is sup∣ported by the most unquestionable histo∣rical evidence, of which many even of the <HI>original</HI> documents (I mean the <HI>an∣nual,</HI> or rather <HI>sessional, writs</HI> themselves) do still exist, in our public records, to this day, is such a detestable perversion of <HI>truth,</HI> such a depravity of human nature, in the baneful service of our great natu∣ral enemy, the <HI>"father of lies,"</HI> that I should hardly have believed my own ears, had I been present when the objection was made.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="11"/>Persons, who discover such impotent malice against <HI>truth,</HI> must be warned of their <HI>spiritual</HI> danger, lest they should be lost for ever!</P>
<P>That you may be able more easily to confute such objectors, I have sent you Browne Willis's Notitia parliamentaria; where you will find, in the very first ta∣ble of writs, (viz. that for the county of Bedford,) examples of <HI>annual</HI> elections for twenty years together, in continual succession, except in one single instance; which omission will be the more easily excused, if it be considered that there were <HI>two general elections</HI> in the year which <HI>preceded</HI> the year of omission, as also <HI>two general elections</HI> in the year which <HI>followed</HI> it. — The period I refer to is be∣tween the 15th of king Edward II. and the 15th of king Edward III. In the 6th year of the latter reign, there were <HI>three</HI> new parliaments; two in the 7th, two in the 10th, two in the 11th, two
<PB N="13" REF="12"/>
in the 12th, two in the 13th, and FOUR in the 14th, year.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It was an ancient usage of our Saxon ancestors, to hold <HI>provincial parliaments,</HI> or <HI>shire-gemots,</HI> regularly twice a year. <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">—<Q>For the assembling of parliament; which, by the insti∣tution of king Alfred, was <HI>to assemble twice a year.</HI></Q> See the speech of sir George Crooke, Justice of the king's-bench, in Hampden's trial on ship-money. Anno 1637, 13 and 14 Car.</NOTE> <HI>"Twa schire-gemot,"</HI> or <HI>two county parli∣aments,</HI> are expressly ordained to be holden <HI>"on gear,"</HI> (i. e. <HI>"in a year,"</HI>) by the 5th law of king Edgar, and the 17th law of Canute. See Lambard's Archionomia, p. 64 and 111.</NOTE> This affords ample proof, not only that <HI>new</HI> parliaments should be holden every year <HI>once,</HI> but even <HI>"more often if need be."</HI> The book con∣tains a great abundance of other exam∣ples: and, though the <HI>annual</HI> elections were sometimes omitted, yet this affords no proof against the peoples <HI>right</HI> to have them. Another learned antiquarian, Mr. Gurdon, informs us, in his History of the high Court of Parliament, page 282, that <Q><HI>new</HI> summonses were to go out for a <HI>new</HI> parliament,<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><P>The continuance of parliaments for a longer term, without <HI>re-election,</HI> seems to have been begun in the reign of king Edward IV. after the people had been so cruelly harrassed by civil war, that they had no spirit or (perhaps) <HI>power</HI> left to oppose that dangerous usur∣pation of their parliamentary rights by <HI>royal prorogations.</HI></P>
<P>In preceding times the <HI>adjournments,</HI> or <HI>prorogations,</HI> (which words had then the same meaning,) were seldom for more than <HI>a few days</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">8 Richard II. <Q>The same Saturday the parliament, for certain causes, by the <HI>commandment,</HI> was ADJOURNED until <HI>Monday ensu∣ing;</HI> and, on the same <HI>Monday,</HI> it was <HI>adjourned</HI> until <HI>Tuesday next following,</HI> for the like cause, at the <HI>king's commandment.</HI></Q> <HI>See sir Rob. Cotton's Abridgement of the Records in the Tower,</HI> p. 303. — <HI>N. B.</HI> These <HI>adjournments,</HI> being made by the <HI>king's command,</HI> were manifestly what we now call <HI>prorogations.</HI></NOTE> at a time; and that only on extraordinary and unavoidable occasions; as <HI>sick∣ness,</HI> the absence of the <HI>king</HI> or <HI>great lords,</HI> the neglect of <HI>"certain sheriffs, in not returning their writs,"</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">7 king Richard II. <Q>The same Friday, being the 20th of April, for that <HI>the duke of Lancaster and other lords</HI> were not returned from the North, and for that also <HI>certain sheriffs had not returned their writs,</HI> the parliament was <HI>adjourned</HI> until <HI>the Wednesday fol∣lowing;</HI> and, in the mean time, the commons were willed to go together to choose their speaker.</Q> <HI>Ibid.</HI> 298.</NOTE> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> or when the representatives <Q>promised to travel to their countries,</Q> to hold farther conference with their con∣stituents, concerning any <HI>"new device."</HI> <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">13 king Edward III. <Q>The commons made answer, That they knew and tendred the king's estate, and were ready to aid the same; <HI>only in this new device they durst not agree without farther conference with their countries;</HI> and so, praying respite until another time, THEY PROMISE TO TRAVEL TO THEIR COUNTRIES.</Q> (<HI>Ibid.</HI> p. 17.) This last is the very best reason that can ever be given for the <HI>prorogation of parliaments,</HI> as this alone can reconcile, with the people's just rights, the <HI>re-assembling</HI> of a parliament without a pre∣vious <HI>re-election:</HI> that is, when the representatives <Q>travel to their <HI>countries,</HI></Q> for the express purpose of <HI>conferring</HI> with the people, and to receive their <HI>instructions.</HI></NOTE></P></NOTE> <HI>once a year,
<PB N="14" REF="13"/>
at the least.</HI></Q> This book I have also sent for your perusal, and likewise an histori∣cal
<PB N="15" REF="14"/>
Treatise of Cities and Boroughs, by Dr. Brady, who bears ample testimony to the means which I have proposed in my first tract, for obtaining <HI>a more equal representation;</HI> for he proves, that, <Q><HI>IN SEVERAL COUNTIES,</HI> the <HI>CITIZENS</HI> and <HI>BURGESSES</HI> were chosen in the <HI>COUNTY-COURTS</HI> with the <HI>KNIGHTS,</HI> on the day of the <HI>KNIGHTS ELECTION,</HI> in the <HI>SAME</HI> court, and jointly returned in <HI>ONE INDENTURE,</HI> especially before the statute of the <HI>23d</HI> of king Henry <HI>VI.</HI> and, in some, after that,</Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> p. 75.</P>
<P>It would be too tedious to give you more proofs respecting <Q>the law of the land,</Q> in answer to the third objec∣tion; and, in answer to the fourth objec∣tion, (<Q>that the whole constitution must be new-modelled to that idea,</Q>) I shall be
<PB N="16" REF="15"/>
still more brief, having only to add, that we are far from desiring that <Q>the consti∣tution may be new-modelled;</Q> we only pray, that the unjust <HI>usurpations,</HI> (made without the consent of the people,) the <HI>corruptions, and other such abuses,</HI> may be taken away and reformed: and then the ancient constitution of <HI>annual</HI> elections, and <HI>"more often if need be,"</HI> will recover its full vigour without any other altera∣tion.</P>
