<HEAD>TO Mrs. DANCER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN a country, where addresses of this nature have generally waited upon the Great, upon a Wealthy Merchant, a Rich Commissary, or some New Man from the Sugar-islands, it will appear as surprizing, to many, as, no doubt, it will to yourself, that a New Form of Dedication should now be introduced. For the trouble I am giving you it will, however, be unnecessary to make any further apology, when I observe that in France, where talents are honoured, it has been frequently the practice of the most cele∣brated wits to do justice to those, who, by their pro∣fession, are the very Organ of the Muses. A VOL∣TAIRE and a MARMONTEL have paid their compli∣ments to a CLAIRON: and why may not an English Author, inferior as he is, and ever must be, to writers of that class, rival at least their politeness, by addressing himself to Mrs. DANCER, one of the first Ornaments of the British Theatre?</P>
<P>There are, indeed, I must confess it, some demands upon my gratitude on this occasion, which even now are struggling to call my attention another way. Mr. GARRICK, Madam, has a claim to all the hand∣some things that can be said of him. His politeness from the moment he saw the play, his assiduity in preparing it for representation, the taste with which he has decorated it, and the warmth of his zeal for the honour of the piece, are circumstances that call upon me for the strongest acknowledgements. I
<PB REF="4"/>
could employ my pen with pleasure in thanking Mr. BARRY for the very fine exertion of his powers, wherever the Poet gave the smallest opportunity. Mr. HOLLAND, who had before now given spirit to such scenes as mine, has renewed the obligation. I could add others to the list, but they, and even Mr. GARRICK at their head, must excuse me, if I turn to Mrs. DANCER, and say with <HI>Hamlet,</HI> "Here's mettle more attractive."</P>
<P>ZENOBIA, Madam, is your own entirely. Where∣ever my inaccuracy has left imperfections, they are so happily varnished over by your skill, that either they are not seen, or you extort forgiveness for them: and if the Author is any where happy enough to <HI>snatch a grace</HI> beyond his usual reach, it is multi∣plied by your address into a number of beauties, like the SWORD in <HI>Tasso'</HI>s <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> which, when bran∣dished by the hand of <HI>Rinaldo,</HI> appears to the whole army to be THREE SWORDS.</P>
<P>The fate of ZENOBIA has been very extraordinary. She was saved in her life-time from the waters of the <HI>Araxes</HI> by the hand of a shepherd, and now she is saved from the critics by Mrs. DANCER.</P>
<P>In testimony of the fact, the play, Madam, is now inscribed to you by him, who admires your talents, and remains</P>

<STAGE>Spoken by Mr. HOLLAND.</STAGE>
<LG>
<L>OF old,—when Greece in a declining age</L>
<L>Of lawless pow'r had felt the barb'rous rage.</L>
<L>This was the tyrant's art:—He gave a prize</L>
<L>To him, who a new pleasure should devise.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ye tyrants of the Pit, whose cold disdain</L>
<L>Rejects and nauseates the repeated strain:</L>
<L>Who call for rarities to quicken sense,</L>
<L>Say, do you always the reward dispense?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ye bards,—to whom French wit gives kind relief,</L>
<L>Are ye not oft the first—to cry STOP THIEF!</L>
<L>Say,—to a brother do you e're allow</L>
<L>One little sprig, one leaf to deck his brow?</L>
<L>No;—fierce invective stuns the play-wright's ears.</L>
<L>Wits, Poets corner, Ledgers, Gazetteers?</L>
<L>'Tis said, the Tartar,—e're he pierce the heart,</L>
<L>Inscribes his name upon his poison'd dart.</L>
<L>That scheme's rejected by each scribbling spark;</L>
<L>—Our Christian system—stabs you in the dark.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And yet the desp'rate author of to-night</L>
<L>Dares on the muses wing another flight;</L>
<L>Once more a dupe to fame forsakes his ease,</L>
<L>And feels th' ambition—here again to please.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He brings a tale from a far distant age,</L>
<L>Enobled by the grave historic page!<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tacitus Ann. Lib. 12. Sect. 44, to end of 5<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE></L>
<L>Zenobia's woes have touch'd each polish'd state;</L>
<L>The brightest eyes of France have mourn'd her fate.</L>
<L>Harmonious Italy her tribute paid,</L>
<L>And sung a dirge to her lamented shade.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet think not that we mean to mock the eye</L>
<L>With pilfer'd colours of a foreign dye.</L>
<L>NOT to translate our bard his pen doth dip;</L>
<L>He takes a play, as Britons take a ship;</L>
<L>They heave her down;—with many a sturdy stroke,</L>
<L>Repair her well, and build with Heart of Oak.</L>
<L>To ev'ry breeze set Britain's streamers free,</L>
<L>NEW-MAN her, and away again to sea.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>This is our author's aim;—and if his art</L>
<L>Waken to sentiment the feeling heart;</L>
<L>If in hit scenes alternate passions burn,</L>
<L>And friendship, love, guilt, virtue take their turn;</L>
<L>If innocence oppress'd lie bleeding here.</L>
<L>You'll give—'tis all he asks—one VIRTUOUS TEAR.</L>
