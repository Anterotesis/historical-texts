<HEAD>AN HISTORY OF BIRDS.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I. Of Birds in General.</HEAD>
<P>WE are now come to a beautiful and loqua∣cious race of animals,
that embellish our forests, amuse our walks, and exclude solitude from
our most shady retirements. From these man has nothing to fear; their
pleasures, their desires, and even their animosities, only serve to
enliven the general picture of Nature, and give har∣mony to meditation.</P>
<P>No part of Nature appears destitute of inha∣bitants. The
woods, the waters, the depths of the earth, have their respective tenants;
while the yielding air, and those tracts of seeming space where man never
can ascend, are also <PB N="2" REF="5"/> passed through by multitudes of
the most beau∣tiful beings of the creation.</P>
<P>Every order and rank of animals seems fitted for its
situation in life; but none more appa∣rently than birds; they share in
common with the stronger race of quadrupedes the vegetable spoils of the
earth, are supplied with swiftness to compensate for their want of
force; and have a faculty of ascending into the air to avoid that power which
they cannot oppose.</P>
<P>The bird seems formed entirely for a life of escape; and
every part of the anatomy of the animal seems calculated for swiftness.
As it is designed to rise upon air, all its parts are pro∣portionably
light, and expand a large surface without solidity.</P>
<P>In a comparative view with man, their for∣mation seems much
ruder and more imperfect; and they are in general found incapable of the
docility even of quadrupedes. Indeed, what great degree of sagacity can be
expected in animals whose eyes are almost as large as their brain? However,
though they fall below qua∣drupedes in the scale of Nature, and are less
imitative of human endowments; yet they hold the next rank, and far surpass
fishes and insects, both in the structure of their bodies and in their
sagacity.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="6"/>As in mechanics the most curious
instruments are generally the most complicated, so it is in anatomy. The
body of man presents the greatest variety upon dissection; quadrupedes,
less per∣fectly formed, discover their defects in the sim∣plicity of
their conformation; the mechanism of birds is still less complex;
fishes are furnished with fewer organs still; whilst insects, more
im∣perfect than all, seem to fill up the chasm that separates animal from
vegetable nature. Of man, the most perfect animal, there are but three or
four species; of quadrupedes, the kinds are more numerous; birds are more
various still; fishes yet more; but insects afford so very great a
variety, that they elude the search of the most inquisitive
pursuer.</P>
<P>Quadrupedes, as was said, have some distant resemblance
in their internal structure with man; but that of birds is entirely
dissimilar. As they seem chiefly formed to inhabit the empty re∣gions of
air, all their parts are adapted to their destined situation. It will be
proper therefore, before I give a general history of birds, to enter into a
slight detail of their anatom and con∣formation.</P>
<P>As to their external parts, they seem surpriz∣ingly adapted
for swiftness of motion. The shape of their body is sharp before, to
pierce and make <PB N="4" REF="7"/> way through the air; it then rises by a
gentle swelling to its bulk, and falls off in an expansive tail, that helps
to keep it buoyant, while the fore-parts are cleaving the air by their
sharp∣ness. From this conformation, they have often been compared to a
ship making its way through water; the trunk of the body answers to the
hold, the head to the prow, the tail to the rudder, and the wings to the oars;
from whence the poets have adopted the metaphor of <HI>remigium alarum,</HI>
when they describe the wavy motion of a bird in flight.</P>
<P>What we are called upon next to admire in the external formation
of birds is, the neat po∣sition of the feathers, lying all one way,
an∣swering at once the purposes of warmth, speed, and security. They
mostly tend backward, and are laid over one another in an exact and regular
order, armed with warm and soft down next the body, and more strongly
fortified and curiously closed externally, to fence off the injuries of the
weather. But, lest the feathers should spoil by their violent attrition
against the air, or imbibe the moisture of the atmosphere, the animal is
furnished with a gland behind, containing a proper quantity of oil, which can
be pressed out by the bird's bill, and laid smoothly over every feather
that wants to be dressed for the <PB N="5" REF="8"/> occasion. This gland
is situated on the rump, and furnished with an opening or excretory duct;
about which grows a small tuft of feathers, somewhat like a painter's
pencil. When, there∣fore, the feathers are shattered or rumpled, the bird,
turning its head backwards, with the bill catches hold of the gland, and,
pressing it, forces out the oily substance, with which it anoints the
disjoined parts of the feathers; and, drawing them out with great
assiduity, recom∣poses and places them in due order; by which they unite
more closely together. Such poultry, however, as live for the most part
under cover, are not furnished with so large a stock of this fluid as
those birds that reside in the open air. The feathers of an hen, for
instance, are pervious to every shower; on the con∣trary, swans, geese,
ducks, and all such as Na∣ture has directed to live upon the water, have
their feathers dressed with oil from the very first day of their leaving
the shell. Thus their stock of fluid is equal to the necessity of its
con∣sumption. Their very flesh contracts a flavour from it, which renders
it in some so very rancid, as to make it utterly unfit for food; however,
though it injures the flesh, it improves the feathers for all the domestic
purposes to which they are usually converted.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="9"/>Nor are the feathers with which birds are
covered less an object of admiration. The shaft of every feather is made
proportionably strong; but hollow below for strength and lightness, and
above filled with a pith to feed the growth of vane or beard that springs
from the shaft of the feather on either side. All these feathers are
placed generally according to their length and strength, so that the
largest and strongest feathers in flight have the greatest share of
duty. The vane, or beard of the feather, is formed with equal contrivance and
care. It consists not of one continued membrane; because, if this were
broken, it could not easily be repaired; but it is composed of many layers,
each some∣what in itself resembling a feather, and lying against each
other in close conjunction. To∣wards the shaft of the feather, these
layers are broad, and of a semicircular form, to serve for strength, and
for the closer grafting them one against another when in action. Towards
the outer part of the vane, these layers grow slender and taper to be more
light. On their under side they are thin and smooth, but their upper outer
edge is parted into two hairy edges, each side having a different sort of
hairs, broad at bottom, and slender and bearded above. By this mechanism,
the hooked beards of one layer <PB N="7" REF="10"/> always lye next the
straight beards of the next, and by that means lock and hold each other.</P>
<P>The next object that comes under considera∣tion in
contemplating an animal that flies, is the wing, the instrument by which this
wonderful progression is performed. In such birds as fly, they are
usually placed at that part of the body which serves to poize the whole,
and support it in a fluid that at first seems so much lighter than
itself. They answer to the fore-legs in quadrupedes, and at the extremity
of this they have a certain finger-like appendix, which is usually called the
<HI>bastard-wing.</HI> This instrument of flight is furnished with
quills, which differ from the common feathers only in their size being
larger, and also from their springing from the deeper part of the skin,
their shafts lying al∣most close to the bone. The beards of these
quills are broad on one side and more narrow on the other, both which
contribute to the pro∣gressive motion of the bird and the closeness of
the wing. The manner in which most birds avail themselves of these is
first thus: they quit the earth with a bound, in order to have room for
flapping with the wing; when they have room for this, they strike the body of
air beneath the wing with a violent motion, and with the whole under surface
of the same; but <PB N="8" REF="11"/> then, to avoid striking the air with
equal vio∣lence on the upper side as they rise, the wing is instantly
contracted; so that the animal rises by the impulse till it spreads the
wing for a second blow. For this reason, we always see birds chuse to
rise against the wind, because they have thus a greater body of air on
the under than the upper side of the wing. For these reasons also large
fowls do not rise easily, both because they have not sufficient room at
first for the motion of their wings, and because the body of air does not
lie so directly under the wing as they rise.</P>
<P>In order to move the wings, all birds are furnished with two
very strong pectoral muscles, which lie on each side of the
breast-bone. The pectoral muscles of quadrupedes are trifling in
comparison to those of birds. In quadrupedes, as well as in man, the
muscles which move the thighs and hinder parts of the body are by far the
strongest, while those of the arms are feeble; but in birds, which make
use of their wings, the contrary obtains; the pectoral muscles that move
the wings or arms are of enormous strength, while those of the thighs are
weak and slender. By means of these, a bird can move its wings with a
degree of strength which, when compared to the animal's size, is 
<PB N="9" REF="12"/> almost incredible. The flap of a swan's wing would
break a man's leg; and a similar blow from an eagle has been known to lay a
man dead in an instant. Such, consequently, is the force of the wing, and
such its lightness, as to be inimitable by art. No machines that human
skill can contrive are capable of giving such force to so light an
apparatus. The art of flying, therefore, that has so often and so
fruitlessly been sought after, must, it is feared, for ever be
unattainable; since as man encreases the force of his flying machine, he
must be obliged to encrease its weight also.</P>
<P>In all birds, except nocturnal ones, the head is smaller, and
bears less proportion to the body than in quadrupedes, that it may more
readily divide the air in flying, and make way for the body, so as to render
its passage more easy. Their eyes also are more flat and depressed
than in quadrupedes; a circle of small plates of bone, placed scalewise,
under the outer coat of the organ, encompasses the pupil on each, to
strengthen and defend it from injuries. Beside this, birds have a kind of
skin, called the nictitating membrane, with which, like a veil, they can at
pleasure cover their eyes, though their eyelids continue open. This membrane
takes its rise from the greater or <PB N="10" REF="13"/> more obtuse corner
of the eye, and serves to wipe, cleanse, and probably to moisten its
sur∣face. The eyes, though they outwardly appear but small, yet
separately, each almost equals the brain; whereas in man the brain is more
than twenty times larger than the orbit of the eye. Nor is this organ in birds
less adapted for vision by a particular expansion of the optic nerve,
which renders the impressions of external objects more vivid and
distinct.</P>
<P>From this conformation of the eye it follows, that the sense
of seeing in birds is infinitely superior to that of other animals. Indeed,
this piercing sight seems necessary to the crea∣ture's support and
safety. Were this organ blunter, from the rapidity of the bird's motion, it
would be apt to strike against every object in its way; and it could
scarcely find subsistence unless possessed of a power to
discern its food from above with astonishing sagacity. An hawk, for
instance, perceives a lark at a di∣stance which neither men nor dogs could
spy; a kite, from an almost imperceptible height in the clouds, darts down
on its prey with the most unerring aim. The sight of birds, therefore,
exceeds what we know in most other animals, and excels them both in
strength and pre∣cision.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="14"/>All birds want the external ear standing
out from the head; they are only furnished with holes that convey sounds to
the auditory ca∣nal. It is true, indeed, that the horned owl, and one or two
more birds, seem to have ex∣ternal ears; but what bears that resemblance
are only feathers sticking out on each side of the head, but no way
necessary to the sense of hearing. It is probable, however, that the
feathers encompassing the ear-holes in birds supply the defect of the
exterior ear, and collect sounds to be transmitted to the internal
sensory. The extreme delicacy of this organ is easily proved by the
readiness with which birds learn tunes, or repeat words, and the great
exactness of their pronunciation.</P>
<P>The sense of smelling seems not less vivid in the
generality of birds. Many of them <HI>wind</HI> their prey at an immense
distance, while others are equally protected by this sense against
their insidious pursuers. In decoys, where ducks are caught, the men who
attend them univer∣sally keep a piece of turf burning near their mouths, upon
which they breathe, lest the fowl should smell them, and consequently
fly away. The universality of this practice puts the neces∣sity of it
beyond a doubt, and proves the ex∣treme delicacy of the sense of
smelling, at least in this species of the feathered creation.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="15"/>Next to the parts for flight, let us view
the legs and feet ministring to motion. They are both made light for the
easier transportation through the air. The toes in some are webbed, to
fit them for the waters; in others they are separate, for the better holding
objects, or clinging to trees for safety. Such as have long legs have also
long necks, as otherwise they would be incapable of gathering up their food,
either by land or water. But it does not hold, however, that those who have
long necks should have long legs, since we see that swans and geese,
whose necks are extremely long, have very short legs, and these chiefly
employed in swimming.</P>
<P>Thus every external part hitherto noticed ap∣pears adapted to
the life and situation of the animal; nor are the inward parts, though less
immediately appropriated to flight, less necessary to safety. The bones
of every part of the body are extremely light and thin; and all the muscles,
except that immediately moving the wings, extremely slight and feeble. The
tail, which is composed of quill feathers, serves to counterbalance the
head and neck, it guides the animal's flight like a rudder, and greatly
assists it either in its ascent or when de∣scending.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="16"/>If we go on to examine birds internally, we
shall find the same wonderful conformation fit∣ting them for a life in air,
and encreasing the surface by diminishing the solidity. In the first
place, their lungs, which are commonly called the sole, stick fast to the
sides of the ribs and back, and can be very little diluted or con∣tracted.
But to make up for this, which might impede their breathing, the ends of the
branches of the wind-pipe open into them, while these have openings into the
cavity of the belly, and convey the air drawn in by breathing into certain
receptacles like bladders, running along the length of the whole body. Nor are
these openings obscure, or difficult to be discerned; for a probe
thrust into the lungs of a fowl will easily find a passage into the
belly; and air blown into the wind-pipe will be seen to distend the
animal's body like a bladder. In quadru∣pedes this passage is stopped by
the midriff; but in fowls the communication is obvious; and consequently they
have a much greater fa∣cility of taking a long and large inspiration. It is
sometimes also seen that the wind-pipe makes many convolutions within the
body of the bird, and it is then called the labyrinth; but of what use
these convolutions are, or why the wind-pipe should make so many turnings
<PB N="14" REF="17"/> within the body of some birds, is a difficulty for which
no naturalist has been able to account.</P>
<P>This difference of the wind-pipe often ob∣tains in animals that
to all appearance are of the same species. Thus in the tame swan, the
wind-pipe makes but a straight passage into the lungs; while in the wild
swan, which to all ex∣ternal appearance seems the same animal, the
wind-pipe pierces through the breast-bone, and there has several turnings,
before it comes out again and goes to enter the lungs. It is not to form the
voice that these turnings are found, since the fowls that are without them
are vocal; and those, particularly the bird just now mentioned, that have
them, are silent. Whence therefore, some birds derive that loud and various
modulation in their warblings is not easily to be accounted for; at least,
the knife of the anatomist goes but a short way in the investigation. All
we are cer∣tain of, is, that birds have much louder voices, in respect to
their bulk, than animals of any other kind; for the bellowing of an ox is not
louder than the scream of a peacock.</P>
<P>In these particulars, birds pretty much re∣semble each other
in their internal conforma∣tion; but there are some varieties which we
should more attentively observe. All birds have, properly speaking, but
one stomach; <PB N="15" REF="18"/> but this is very different in different
kinds. In all the rapacious kinds that live upon animal food, as well as in
some of the fish-feeding tribe, the stomach is peculiarly formed. The
oeso∣phagus, or gullet, in them is found replete with glandulous bodies,
which serves to dilate and macerate the food as it passes into the
sto∣mach, which is always very large in proportion to the size of the bird,
and generally wrapped round with fat, in order to encrease its warmth and
powers of digestion.</P>
<P>Granivorous birds, or such as live upon fruits, corn, and
other vegetables, have their intestines differently formed from those of
the rapacious kind. Their gullet dilates just above the breast-bone, and
forms itself into a pouch or bag, called the crop. This is replete with
salivary glands, which serve to moisten and soften the grain and other
food which it contains. These glands are very numerous, with longitudinal
openings, which emit a whitish and a viscous substance. After the dry
food of the bird has been macerated for a convenient time, it then passes
into the belly, where, instead of a soft moist stomach, as in the
rapacious kinds, it is ground between two pair of muscles, commonly called
the gizzard, covered on the inside with a stony ridgy coat, and almost
cartilaginous. <PB N="16" REF="19"/> These coats, rubbing against each
other, are capable of bruising and attenuating the hardest substances,
their action being often compared to that of the grinding-teeth in man and
other animals. Thus the organs of digestion are in a manner reversed in
birds. Beasts grind their food with their teeth, and then it passes into
the stomach, where it is softened and di∣gested. On the contrary, birds
of this sort first macerate and soften it in the crop, and then it it is
ground and comminuted in the stomach or gizzard. Birds are also careful to
pick up sand, gravel, and other hard substances, not to grind their food,
as has been supposed, but to prevent the too violent action of the coats of
the stomach against each other.</P>
<P>Most birds have two appendices or blind guts, which in
quadrupedes are always found single. Among such birds as are thus
supplied, all carnivorous fowl, and all birds of the spar∣row kind, have
very small and short ones: water-fowl, and birds of the poultry kind, the
longest of all. There is still another appendix observable in the
intestines of birds, resembling a little worm, which is nothing more than
the remainder of that passage by which the yolk was conveyed into the guts
of the young chicken, while yet in the egg and under incu∣bation.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="20"/>The outlet of that duct which conveys the
bile into the intestines is, in most birds, a great way distant from the
stomach; which may arise from the danger there would be of the bile
re∣gurgitating into the stomach in their various rapid motions, as we see
in men at sea; where∣fore their biliary duct is so contrived, that this
regurgitation cannot take place.</P>
<P>All birds, though they want a bladder for urine, have large
kidneys and ureters, by which this secretion is made, and carried away by one
common canal. 
<Q REND="inline">"Birds," says Harvey, "as well as serpents,
which have spongy lungs, make but little water, because they drink but
little. They, therefore, have no need of a bladder; but their urine distils
down into the common canal, designed for receiving the other excrements of
the body. The urine of birds differs from that of other animals; for, as there
is usually in urine two parts, one more serous and liquid, the other more
thick and gross, which subsides to the bottom; in birds, this part is
most abundant, and is di∣stinguished from the rest by its white or
silver colour. This part is found not only in the whole intestinal canal,
but is seen also in the whole channel of the ureters, which may be
distinguished from the coats of the kidneys <PB N="18" REF="21"/> by their
whiteness. This milky substance they have in greater plenty than the more
thin and serous part; and it is of a middle consistence, between limpid
urine and the grosser parts of the faeces. In passing through the
ureters, it resembles milk curdled or lightly condensed; and, being cast
forth easily, congeals into a chalky crust."</Q></P>
<P>From this simple conformation of the animal, it should
seem that birds are subject to few dis∣eases; and, in fact, they have
but few. There is one, however, which they are subject to, from which
quadrupedes are in a great measure exempt: this is the annual molting which
they suffer; for all birds whatsoever obtain a new covering of feathers
once a year, and cast the old. During the molting season, they ever
appear disordered; those most remarkable for their courage then lose
all their fierceness; and such as are of a weakly constitution often
expire under this natural operation. No feeding can maintain their strength;
they all cease to breed at this season; that nourishment which goes to
the production of the young is wholly absorbed by the demand required for
supplying the na∣scent plumage.</P>
<P>This molting time, however, may be arti∣ficially accelerated;
and those who have the <PB N="19" REF="22"/> management of singing birds
frequently put their secret in practice. They enclose the bird in a dark
cage, where they keep it excessively warm, and throw the poor little animal
into an artificial fever; this produces the molt; his old feathers fall before
their time, and a new set take place, more brilliant and beautiful than the
former. They add, that it mends the bird's singing, and encreases its
vivacity; but it must not be concealed, that scarce one bird in three
survives the operation.</P>
<P>The manner in which Nature performs this operation of molting is
thus: the quill or fea∣ther, when first protruded from the skin and come to
its full size, grows harder as it grows older, and receives a kind of
periosteum or skin round the shaft by which it seems attached to the
animal. In proportion as the quill grows older, its sides, or the bony pen
part, thicken; but its whole diameter shrinks and decreases. Thus, by the
thickening of its sides, all nou∣rishment from the body becomes more
sparing; and, by the decrease of its diameter, it becomes more loosely
fixed in its socket, till at length it falls out. In the mean time, the
rudiments of an incipient quill are beginning below. The skin forms itself
into a little bag, which is fed <PB N="20" REF="23"/> from the body by a small
vein and artery, and which every day encreases in size till it is
pro∣truded. While the one end vegetates into the beard or vane of the feather,
that part attached to the skin is still soft, and receives a constant
supply of nourishment, which is diffused through the body of the quill by
that little light substance which we always find within when we make a pen.
This substance, which as yet has received no name that I know of, serves
the growing quill as the umbilical artery does an infant in the womb, by
supplying it with nourishment, and diffusing that nourishment over the
whole frame. When, however, the quill is come to its full growth, and requires
no further nou∣rishment, the vein and artery become less and less, till
at last the little opening by which they communicated with the quill becomes
wholly obliterated; and the quill thus deprived con∣tinues in its socket for
some months, till in the end it shrinks, and leaves room for a repetition
of the same process of nature as before.</P>
<P>The molting season commonly obtains from the end of summer
to the middle of autumn. The bird continues to struggle with this malady
during the winter, and Nature has kindly pro∣vided, that when there are the
fewest pro∣visions, <PB N="21" REF="24"/> that then the animal's appetite
shall be least craving. At the beginning of spring, when food begins
again to be plenty, the ani∣mal's strength and vigour return. It is then that
the abundance of provisions, aided by the mildness of the season,
incite it to love, and all Nature seems teeming with life, and disposed
to continue it.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. Of the Generation, Nestling and Incubation of
Birds.</HEAD>
<P>THE return of spring is the beginning of pleasure. Those
vital spirits which seemed locked up during the winter, then begin to
expand; vegetables and insects supply abundance of food; and the bird
having more than a sufficiency for its own subsistence, is impelled to
transfuse life as well as to maintain it. Those warblings which had been
hushed during the colder seasons, now begin to animate the fields; every
grove and bush resounds with the challenge of anger, or the call of
allurement. This delightful concert of the grove, which is so much admired by
man, is no way studied for his amusement: it is usually the call of the
male to the female; his efforts to sooth her during the times of incu∣bation:
or it is a challenge between two males, for the affections of some common
favourite.</P>
<P>It is by this call that birds begin to pair at the approach of
spring, and provide for the support of a future progeny. The loudest
notes are usually from the male; while the hen seldom expresses her
consent, but in a short, interrupted <PB N="23" REF="26"/> twittering. This
compact, at least for the season, holds with unbroken faith: many birds
live with inviolable fidelity together for a con∣stancy; and when one dies,
the other is always seen to share the same fate soon after. We must
not take our idea of the conjugal fidelity of birds from observing the
poultry in our yards, whose freedom is abridged, and whose manners are
totally corrupted by slavery. We must look for it in our fields and our
forests, where nature continues in unadulterated simplicity; where the
number of males is generally equal to that of females; and where every little
animal seems prouder of his progeny than pleased with his mate. Were it
possible to compare sensations, the male of all wild birds seems as
happy in the young brood as the female; and all his former caresses, all
his soothing melodies, seem only aimed at that important occasion when
they are both to become parents, and to educate a pro∣geny of their own
producing. The pleasures of love appear dull in their effects, when com∣pared
to the interval immediately after the ex∣clusion of their young. They both
seem, at that season, transported with pleasure; every action
testifies their pride, their importance, and tender solicitude.</P>
<P>When the business of fecundation is per∣formed, 
<PB N="24" REF="27"/> the female then begins to lay. Such eggs as have been
impregnated by the cock are prolific; and such as have not (for she lays
often without any congress whatsoever) continue bar∣ren, and are only
addled by incubation. Pre∣vious, however, to laying, the work of nestling
becomes the common care; and this is per∣formed with no small degree of
assiduity and apparent design. It has been asserted, that birds of
one kind always make their nests in the same manner, and of the same
materials; but the truth is, that they vary this as the materials, places, or
climates happen to differ. The red-breast, in some parts of England, makes
its nest with oak leaves, where they are in greatest plenty; in other parts
with moss and hair. Some birds, that with us make a very warm nest, are
less solicitous in the tropical climates, where the heat of the weather
promotes the business of incubation. In general, however, every species
of birds has a peculiar archi∣tecture of its own; and this adapted to the
number of eggs, the temperature of the cli∣mate, or the respective heat of
the little animal's own body. Where the eggs are numerous, it is then incumbent
to make the nest warm, that the animal heat may be equally diffused to them
all. Thus the wren, and all the small birds, <PB N="25" REF="28"/> make the
nest very warm; for having many eggs, it is requisite to distribute
warmth to them in common: on the contrary, the plover, that has but two eggs,
the eagle, and the crow, are not so solicitous in this respect, as their
bodies are capable of being applied to the small number upon which they
sit. With regard to climate, water-fowl, that with us make but a very
slovenly nest, are much more exact in this particular, in the colder
regions of the north. They there take every precaution to make it warm; and
some kinds strip the down from their breasts, to line it with greater
security.</P>
<P>In general, however, every bird resorts to hatch in those
climates and places where its food is found in greatest plenty; and always at
that season when provisions are in the greatest abundance. The large
birds, and those of the aquatic kinds, chuse places as remote from man as
possible, as their food is in general different from that which is
cultivated by human labour. Some birds, which have only the serpent to fear,
build their nests depending from the end of a small bough, and form the
entrance from below; being thus secured either from the ser∣pent or the
monkey tribes. But all the little birds which live upon fruits and corn, and
that are too often unwelcome intruders upon the <PB N="26" REF="29"/> fruits of
human industry, in making their nests, use every precaution to conceal
them from man. On the other hand, the great birds, remote from human society,
use every precaution to render theirs inaccessible to wild beasts or
vermin.</P>
<P>Nothing can exceed the patience of birds while hatching; neither
the calls of hunger, nor the near approach of danger, can drive them from the
nest. They are often fat upon be∣ginning to sit, yet before incubation is
over, the female is usually wasted to skin and bone. Ravens and crows,
while the females are sitting, take care to provide them with food; and this
in great abundance. But it is different with most of the smaller kinds:
during the whole time the male sits near his mate upon some tree, and
sooths her by his singing; and often when she is tired takes her place,
and patiently continues upon the nest till she returns. Sometimes, however,
the eggs acquire a degree of heat too much for the purposes of hatching: in
such cases, the hen leaves them to cool a little; and then returns to
sit, with her usual perseverance and pleasure.</P>
<P>So great is the power of instinct, in animals of this class,
that they seem driven from one ap∣petite to another, and continue almost
passive under its influence. Reason we cannot call it, 
<PB N="27" REF="30"/> since the first dictates of that principle would be
self-preservation: 
<Q REND="inline">"Take a brute," says Ad∣dison, "out of his
instinct, and you find him wholly deprived of understanding. With what
caution," continues he, "does the hen provide herself a nest in places
unfrequented, and free from noise and disturbance! When she has laid her
eggs in such a manner that she can cover them, what care does she take in
turning them frequently, that all parts may partake of the vital warmth! When
she leaves them to provide for her necessary sustenance, how
punctually does she return before they have time to cool, and become
incapable of producing an animal! In the summer you see her giving
herself greater freedoms, and quit∣ting her care for above two hours
together: but in winter, when the rigour of the season would chill the
principles of life, and destroy the young one, she grows more assiduous
in her attendance, and stays away but half the time. When the birth
approaches, with how much nicety and attention does she help the chick to
break the prison! not to take notice of her covering it from the injuries of
the weather, providing it with proper nourish∣ment, and teaching it to help
itself; nor to mention her forsaking the nest, if, after the 
<PB N="28" REF="31"/> usual time of reckoning, the young one does not make its
appearance. A chymical opera∣tion could not be followed with greater art or
diligence than is seen in the hatching a chick, though there are many birds
that shew an in∣finitely greater sagacity: yet at the same time the hen,
that has all this seeming ingenuity, (which is indeed absolutely
necessary for the propagation of the species) considered in other
respects, is without the least glimmerings of thought or common sense:
she mistakes a piece of chalk for an egg, and sits upon it in the same
manner; she is insensible of any encrease or diminution in the number
of those she lays; she does not distinguish between her own, and
those of another species; and when the birth appears of never so
different a bird, will cherish it for her own. An hen followed by a brood of
ducks, shall stand affrighted at the edge of the pond, trembling for the
fate of her young, which she sees venturing into so dan∣gerous an
element. As the different principle which acts in these different animals
cannot be termed reason, so when we call it instinct, we mean something
we have no knowledge of. It appears to me the immediate direction of
Pro∣vidence; and such an operation of the Supreme Being as that which
determines all the por∣tions of matter to their proper centers."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="32"/>The production of the young, as was said,
seems to be the great aera of a bird's happiness. Nothing can at that time
exceed its spirit and industry: the most timid becomes courageous in the
defence of its young. Birds of the rapa∣cious kind, at this season, become
more than usually fierce and active. They carry their prey, yet throbbing
with life, to the nest, and early accustom their young to habits of
slaughter and cruelty. Nor are those of milder natures less busily
employed; the little birds then discon∣tinue their singing, taken up with
more import∣ant pursuits of common subsistence.</P>
<P>While the young are yet unfledged, and continue in the nest,
the old ones take care to provide them with a regular supply; and, lest one
should take all nourishment from the rest, they feed each of the young in
their turn. If they perceive that man has been busy with their nest, or has
handled the little ones, they abandon the place by night, and provide their
brood a more secure, though less commodious retreat. When the whole family
is fully plumed, and capable of avoiding danger by flight, they are then led
forth when the weather is fine, and taught the paternal art of providing for
their subsistence. They are led to the places where their food lies; they
are shewn the method of <PB N="30" REF="33"/> discovering or carrying it
away; and then led back to the nest, for a day or two longer. At length, when
they are completely qualified to shift for themselves, the old ones take
them abroad, and leading them to the accustomed places, forsake them for
the last time; and all future connexion is ever at an end.</P>
<P>Those birds which are hatched and sent out earliest in the
season are the most strong and vigorous; those, on the other hand,
that have been delayed till the midst of summer, are more feeble and
tender, and sometimes incapable of sustaining the rigours of the
ensuing winter. Birds themselves seem sensible of this difference,
and endeavour to produce early in the spring. If, however, their efforts are
obstructed by having their nests robbed, or some similar ac∣cident,
they still persevere in their efforts for a progeny; and it often happens
that some are thus retarded till the midst of winter. What number of eggs
any bird can lay in the course of a season is not ascertained; but this
is true, that such as would have laid but two or three at the most, if
their nests be robbed, or their eggs stolen, will lay above ten or twelve.
A common hen, if moderately fed, will lay above an hundred from the beginning
of spring to the latter end of autumn. In general, however, it 
<PB N="31" REF="34"/> obtains, that the smallest and weakest animals are
the most prolific, while the strong and ra∣pacious are abridged by
sterility. Thus, such kinds as are easily destroyed, are as readily
re∣paired; and Nature, where she has denied the power of resistance, has
compensated by the fer∣tility attending procreation.</P>
<P>Birds in general, though they have so much to fear from man
and each other, are seldom scared away from their usual haunts. Although
they be so perfectly formed for a wandering life, and are supplied with
powers to satisfy all their appetites, though never so remote from the
ob∣ject, though they are so well fitted for changing place with ease and
rapidity, yet the greatest number remain contented in the districts where
they have been bred, and by no means exert their desires in proportion to
their endowments. The rook, if undisturbed, never desires to leave his
native grove; the black-bird still frequents its accustomed hedge; and the
red-breast, though seemingly mild, claims a certain district, from whence
he seldom moves, but drives out every one of the same species from thence
with∣out pity. They are excited to migration by no other motives but those of
fear, climate, or hunger. It must be from one of these powerful motives
that the birds, which are called birds of <PB N="32" REF="35"/> passage,
every year forsake us for some time, and make their regular and expected
returns.</P>
<P>Nothing has more employed the curiosity of mankind than
these annual emigrations; and yet few subjects continue so much involved
in darkness. It is generally believed, that the cause of their retreat from
these parts of Europe is either a scarcity of food at certain seasons,
or the want of a secure asylum from the perse∣cution of man during the
time of courtship and bringing up their young. Thus the starling, in
Sweden, at the approach of winter, finding subsistence no longer in that
kingdom, descends every year into Germany; and the hen chaf∣finches of the
same country are seen every year to fly through Holland in large flocks, to
pass their winter in a milder climate. Others, with a more daring spirit,
prepare for journies that might intimidate even human perseverance. Thus the
quails in spring forsake the burning heats of Africa for the milder sun
of Europe; and, when they have passed the summer with us, steer their
slight back to enjoy in Egypt the temperate air, which then begins to be
delightful. This with them seems a preconcerted under∣taking. They unite
together in some open place, for some days before their departure, and, by
an odd kind of chattering, seem to de∣bate <PB N="33" REF="36"/> on the method
to proceed. When their plan is resolved upon, they all take flight to∣gether,
and often appear in such numbers, that, to mariners at sea, they seem
like a cloud that rests upon the horizon. The boldest, strongest, and
by far the greatest number, make good their intention; but many there are
who, not well apprized of their own force for the un∣dertaking, grow weary in
the way and, quite spent by the fatigues of their flight, drop down into the
sea, and sometimes upon deck, thus becoming an easy prey to the
mariner.</P>
<P>Of the vast quantity of water-fowl that fre∣quent our
shores, it is amazing to reflect how few are known to breed here. The cause
that principally urges them to leave this country seems to be not merely the
want of food, but the desire of a secure retreat. Our country is too
populous for birds so shy and timid as the greatest number of these
are. When great part of our island was a mere waste, an uncultivated tract
of woods and marshes, many species of birds which now migrate remained with
us throughout the year. The great heron and the crane, that have now forsaken
this country, in former times bred familiarly in our marshes, and seemed to
animate our fens. Their nests, like those of most cloven-footed
water-fowl, were <PB N="34" REF="37"/> built on the ground, and exposed to
every in∣vader. But as rural oeconomy encreased, these animals were more
and more disturbed. Before they had little to fear, as the surrounding
marsh defended them from all the carnivorous quadru∣pedes, and their own
strength from birds of prey; but upon the intrusion of man, and by a long
series of alarms, they have at length been obliged to seek, during the
summer, some lonely habi∣tation, at a safe distance from every
destroyer.</P>
<P>Of the numerous tribes of the duck kind, we know of no more than
five that breed here; the tame swan, the tame goose, the sheldrake, the
eider duck, and a few of the wild ducks. The rest contribute to form that
amazing mul∣titude of water-fowl which annually repair to the dreary lakes and
desarts of Lapland from the more southern countries of Europe. In those
extensive and solitary retreats, they perform the duties of incubation and
nutrition in full secu∣rity. There are few of this kind that may not be
traced to the northern deserts, to countries of lakes, rivers, swamps, and
mountains, covered with thick and gloomy forests, that afford shelter
during summer to the timid animals, who live there in undisturbed
security. In those regions, from the thickness of the forests, the
ground remains moist and penetrable during the sum∣mer <PB N="35" REF="38"/>
season; the woodcock, the snipe, and other slender billed birds, can
there feed at ease; while the web-footed birds find more than sufficient
plenty of food from the number of insects, which swarm there to an
incredible degree. The days there are long; and the beautiful meteorous nights
afford them every opportunity of col∣lecting so minute a food, which is
probably of all others the most grateful. We are not to be astonished,
therefore, at the amazing numbers of fowl that descend from these regions
at the approach of winter; numbers to which the army of Xerxes was but trifling
in comparison; and which Linnaeus has observed for eight whole days and
nights to cover the surface of the river Calix.</P>
<P>This migration from the north usually begins in September,
when they quit their retreats, and disperse themselves over all the
southern parts of Europe. It is not unpleasing to observe the order of
their flight; they generally range themselves in a long line, or they
sometimes make their march angularly, two lines uniting in the center like
the letter V reversed. The bird which leads at the point seems to cleave
the air, to facilitate the passage for those which are to fol∣low. When
fatigued with this laborious station, it falls back into one of the wings of
the file, <PB N="36" REF="39"/> while another takes its place. With us they make
their appearance about the beginning of Oc∣tober, circulate first round our
shores, and, when compelled by severe frost, betake themselves to our
lakes and rivers. Some, indeed, of the web-footed fowl, of hardier
constitutions than the rest, abide the rigours of their northern climate
the whole winter; but when the cold reigns there with more than usual
severity, they are obliged to seek for more southern skies. They then
repair with the rest for shelter to these king∣doms; so that the diver,
the wild swan, and the swallow-tailed sheldrake, visit our coasts but
sel∣dom, and that only when compelled by the se∣verity of their winters at
home.</P>
<P>It has been often a subject of astonishment, how animals
to all appearance so dull and irra∣tional should perform such long
journeys, should know whither to steer, and when to set out upon such a
great undertaking. It is probable that the same instinct which governs all
their other actions operates also here. They rather follow the weather than
the country; they steer only from colder or warmer climates into those of
an opposite nature; and, finding the variations of the air as they proceed in
their favour, go on till they find land to repose on. It cannot be
sup∣posed that they have any memory of the country <PB N="37" REF="40"/>
where they might have spent a former winter; it cannot be supposed that
they see the country to which they travel from their height in the air;
since, though they mounted for miles, the con∣vexity of the globe would
intercept their view; it must therefore only be, that they go on as they
continue to perceive the atmosphere more suitable to their present wants
and dispositions.</P>
<P>All this seems to be pretty plain; but there is a
circumstance attending the migration of swal∣lows which wraps this
subject in great obscurity. It is agreed on all hands, that they are seen
mi∣grating into warmer climates, and that in amazing numbers, at the approach
of the European win∣ter. Their return into Europe is also as well at∣tested
about the beginning of summer; but we have another account, which serves to
prove that numbers of them continue torpid here during the winter; and, like
bats, make their retreat into old walls, the hollow of trees, or even sink
into the deepest lakes, and find security for the winter season, by
remaining there in clusters at the bottom. However this latter circumstance
may be, their retreat into old walls is too well authenticated to remain a
doubt at present. The difficulty, therefore, is to account for this
dif∣ference in these animals thus variously preparing to encounter the
winter. It was supposed that <PB N="38" REF="41"/> in some of them the
blood might lose its motion by the cold, and that thus they were rendered
torpid by the severity of the season; but Mr. Buffon having placed many
of this tribe in an ice-house, found that the same cold by which their
blood was congealed was fatal to the ani∣mal; it remains, therefore, a doubt to
this hour whether there may not be a species of swallows, to all external
appearance like the rest, but differently formed within, so as to fit them
for a state of insensibility during the winter here. It was
suggested, indeed, that the swallows found thus torpid were such only
as were too weak to undertake the migration, or were hatched too late to join
the general convoy; but it was upon these that Mr. Buffon tried his
experiment; it was these that died under the operation.</P>
<P>Thus there are some birds which by migrating make an
habitation of every part of the earth; but in general every climate has birds
peculiar to itself. The feathered inhabitants of the temperate zone are but
little remarkable for the beauty of their plumage; but then the smaller kinds
make up for this defect by the melody of their voices. The birds of the torrid
zone are very bright and vivid in their colours; but they have screaming
voices, or are totally silent. The frigid zone, on the other hand, where the 
<PB N="39" REF="42"/> seas abound with fish, are stocked with birds of the
aquatic kind, in much greater plenty than in Europe; and these are generally
cloathed with a warmer coat of feathers; or they have large quantities of fat
lying underneath the skin, which serves to defend them from the rigours of
the climate.</P>
<P>In all countries, however, birds are a more long-lived class
of animals than the quadrupedes or insects of the same climate. The life of
man himself is but short, when compared to what some of them enjoy. It is
said that swans have been known to live three hundred years: geese are
often seen to live fourscore; while linnets, and other little birds, though
imprisoned in cages, are often found to reach fourteen or fifteen. How birds,
whose age of perfection is much more early than that of quadrupedes, should
yet live comparatively so much longer, is not easily to be accounted for:
perhaps, as their bones are lighter, and more porous than those of
quadrupedes, there are fewer obstructions in the animal machine; and Nature,
thus finding more room for the operations of life, it is car∣ried on to a
greater extent.</P>
<P>All birds in general are less than quadru∣pedes; that is, the
greatest of one class far surpass the greatest of the other in
magnitude <PB N="40" REF="43"/> The ostrich, which is the greatest of birds,
bears no proportion to the elephant; and the smallest humming-bird, which
is the least of the class, is still far more minute than the mouse. In
these the extremities of Nature are plainly di∣scernible; and in forming
them she appears to have been doubtful in her operations: the ostrich,
seemingly covered with hair, and in∣capable of flight, making near approaches
to the quadrupede class; while the humming-bird, of the size of an
humble-bee, and with a flut∣tering motion, seems nearly allied to the
insect.</P>
<P>These extremities of this class are rather ob∣jects of human
curiosity than utility: it is the middle order of birds which man has taken
care to propagate and maintain. Of those which he has taken under his
protection, and which administer to his pleasures or necessities, the
greatest number seem creatures of his for∣mation. The variety of climate to
which he consigns them, the food with which he supplies them, and the
purposes for which he employs them, produce amazing varieties, both in their
colours, shape, magnitude, and the taste of their flesh. Wild birds are,
for the most part, of the same magnitude and shape; they still keep the
prints of primaeval nature strong upon them: except in a few they generally
maintain <PB N="41" REF="44"/> their very colour: but it is otherwise with
do∣mestic animals; they change at the will of man—of the tame pigeon,
for instance, it is said that they can be bred to a feather.</P>
<P>As we are thus capable of influencing their form and colour,
so also is it frequent to see equal instances of our influencing their
habitudes, appetites and passions. The cock, for instance, is
artificially formed into that courage and acti∣vity which he is seen to
possess; and many birds testify a strong attachment to the hand that
feeds them: how far they are capable of instruction, is manifest to those
who have the care of hawks. But a still more surprizing instance of this,
was seen some time ago in London: a canary bird was taught to pick up the
letters of the alphabet, at the word of command, so as to spell any
person's name in company; and this the little animal did by motions from its
master, which were imperceptible to every other spectator. Upon the whole,
however, they are inferior to quadrupedes in docility; and seem more
me∣chanically impelled by all the power of instinct.</P>

<PB N="42" REF="45"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. III. Of the Division of Birds.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH birds are fitted for sporting in air, yet as they find
their food upon the surface of the earth, there seems a variety equal to
the different aliments with which it tends to supply them. The flat and
burning desart, the rocky cliff, the extensive fen, the stormy ocean, as
well as the pleasing landscape, have all their peculiar inhabitants. The
most obvious di∣stinction therefore of birds, is into those that live by
land, and those that live by water; or, in other words, into <HI>land
birds,</HI> and <HI>water fowl.</HI></P>
<P>It is no difficult matter to distinguish land from water
fowl, by the legs and toes. All land birds have their toes divided, without any
mem∣brane or web between them; and their legs and feet serve them for the
purposes of running, grasping, or climbing. On the other hand, water fowl
have their legs and feet formed for the purposes of wading in water, or
swimming on its surface. In those that wade, the legs are usually long
and naked; in those that swim, the toes are webbed together, as we see in
the feet of a goose, which serve, like oars, to drive <PB N="43" REF="46"/>
them forward with greater velocity. The for∣mation, therefore, of land and
water fowl, is as distinct as their habits; and Nature herself seems to
offer us this obvious distribution, in methodizing animals of the feathered
creation.</P>
<P>However, a distinction so comprehensive goes but a short
way in illustrating the different tribes of so numerous a class. The
number of birds already known, amounts to above eight hundred; and every
person who turns his mind to these kinds of pursuits, is every day adding
to the catalogue. It is not enough, therefore, to be able to distinguish a
land from a water fowl; much more is still required: to be able to
di∣stinguish the different kinds of birds from each other; and even the
varieties in the same kind, when they happen to offer. This certainly is a
work of great difficulty; and perhaps the at∣tainment will not repay the
labour. The sen∣sible part of mankind will not withdraw all their attention
from more important pursuits, to give it entirely up to what promises to
repay them only with a very confined species of amusement. In my
distribution of birds, therefore, I will follow Linnaeus in the first
sketch of his system; and then leave him, to follow the most natural
distinctions, in enumerating the different kinds that admit of an history,
or require a description<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="47"/>Linnaeus divides all birds into six
classes: namely, into birds of the <HI>rapacious kind,</HI> birds of the
<HI>pie kind,</HI> birds of the <HI>poultry kind,</HI> birds of the
<HI>sparrow kind,</HI> birds of the <HI>duck kind,</HI> and birds of the
<HI>crane kind.</HI> The four first com∣prehend the various kinds of land
birds; the two last, those that belong to the water.</P>
<P>Birds of the <HI>rapacious kind</HI> constitute that class
of carnivorous fowl that live by rapine. He distinguishes them by their
beak, which is hooked, strong, and notched at the point; by their legs, which
are short and muscular, and made for the purposes of tearing; by their
toes, which are strong and knobbed; and their talons, which are sharp and
crooked; by the make of their body, which is muscular; and their flesh,
which is impure: nor are they less known by their food, which consists
entirely of flesh; their stomach, which is membranous; and their manners,
which are fierce and cruel.</P>
<P>Birds of the <HI>pie kind</HI> have the bill differing from the
former: as in those it resembled an hook, destined for tearing to pieces;
in these it resembles a wedge, fitted for the purpose of cleaving. Their
legs are formed short and strong for walking; their body is slender and
impure, and their food miscellaneous. They nestle in trees; and the male
feeds the female during the time of incubation.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="48"/>Birds of the <HI>poultry kind</HI> have the
bill a little convex, for the purposes of gathering their food. The upper
chap hangs over the lower; their bodies are fat and muscular, and their
flesh white and pure. They live upon grain, which is moistened in the crop.
They make their nest on the ground, without art; they lay many eggs, and
use promiscuous venery.</P>
<P>Birds of the <HI>sparrow kind</HI> comprehend all that
beautiful and vocal class that adorn our fields and groves, and gratify every
sense in its turn. Their bills may be compared to a forceps that catches
hold: their legs are formed for hopping along; their bodies are tender; pure in
such as feed upon grain, impure in such as live upon insects. They live
chiefly in trees; their nests are artificially made, and their amours are
observed with connubial fidelity.</P>
<P>Birds of the <HI>duck kind</HI> use their bill as a kind of
strainer to their food; it is smooth, covered with a skin, and nervous at
the point. Their legs are short, and their feet formed for swim∣ming, the
toes being webbed together. Their body is fat, inclining to rancidity. They
live in waters, and chiefly build their nests upon land.</P>
<P>With respect to the order of birds that belong to the waters,
those of the <HI>crane kind</HI> have the <PB N="46" REF="49"/> bill formed
for the purposes of searching and examining the bottom of pools: their legs
are long, and formed for wading; their toes are not webbed; their thighs are
half naked; their body is slender, and covered with a very thin skin; their
tail is short, and their flesh savoury. They live in lakes upon animals,
and they chiefly build their nests upon the ground.</P>
<P>Such is the division of Linnaeus, with respect to this
class of animals; and at first sight it appears natural and
comprehensive. But we must not be deceived by appearances: the student,
who should imagine he was making a progress in the history of nature,
while he was only thus making arbitrary distributions, would be very much
mistaken. Should he come to enter deeper into this naturalist's plan, he
would find birds the most unlike in nature thrown together into the same
class; and find animals joined, that entirely differ in climate, in
ha∣bitudes, in manners, in shape, colouring and size. In such a
distribution, for instance, he would find the humming-bird and the raven,
the rail and the ostrich, joined in the same family. If when he asked
what sort of a creature was the humming-bird, he were told that it was in the
same class with the carrion crow, would he not think himself imposed 
<PB N="47" REF="50"/> upon? In such a case, the only way to form any idea of
the animal whose history he desires to know, is to see it; and that
curiosity very few have an opportunity of gratifying. The number of birds is
so great, that it might exhaust the patience not only of the writer, but
the reader, to examine them all: in the present confined undertaking it would
certainly be impossible. I will therefore now attach myself to a more
natural method: and, still keeping the general division of Linnaeus before
me, enter into some description of the most noted, or the most worth
knowing.</P>
<P>Under one or other class, as I shall treat them, the reader
will probably find all the species, and all the varieties that demand his
curiosity. When the leader of any tribe is described, and its history
known, it will give a very tolerable idea of all the species contained under
it. It is true, the reader will not thus have his knowledge ranged under such
precise distinctions; nor can he be able to say, with such fluency,
that the rail is of the ostrich class: but what is much more material, he
will have a tolerable history of the bird he desires to know, or at least
of that which most resembles it in nature.</P>
<P>However, it may be proper to apprize the <PB N="48" REF="51"/>
reader that he will not here find his curiosity satisfied, as in some of
the former volumes, where we often took Mr. Buffon for our guide. Those who
have hitherto written the natural history of birds, have in general been
contented with telling their names, or describing their toes or their
plumage. It must often therefore happen, that instead of giving the
history of a bird, we must be content to importune the reader with merely
its description. I will there∣fore divide the following history of birds,
with Linnaeus, into six parts: in the first of which I will give such as
Brisson has ranged among the rapacious birds; next those of the pie kind;
and thus go on through the succeeding classes, till I finish with
those of the duck kind. But before I enter upon a systematic detail, I
will beg leave to give the history of three or four birds, that do not well
range in any system. These, from their great size, are sufficiently
distinguishable from the rest; and from their incapacity of flying, lead
a life a good deal differing from the rest of the feathered creation. The
birds I mean are the Ostrich, the Cassowary, the Emu, the Dodo, and the
Solitaire.</P>

<P> <PB N="49" REF="53"/>IN beginning with the feathered tribe, the
first animal that offers seems to unite the class of quadrupedes and of
birds in itself. While it has the general outline and properties of a bird,
yet it retains many of the marks of the quadrupede. In appearance the ostrich
resembles the camel, and is almost as tall; it is covered with a plumage
that resembles hair much more nearly than feathers, and its internal parts
bear as near a similitude to those of the quadrupede as of the bird
creation. It may be considered, therefore, as an animal made to fill up that
chasm in nature which separates one class of beings from another.</P>
<P>The ostrich is the largest of all birds. Tra∣vellers affirm
that they are seen as tall as a man on horseback; and even some of
those that have been brought into England were above seven feet high. The
head and bill somewhat resemble those of a duck; and the neck may be
likened to that of a swan, but that it is much longer; the legs and thighs
resemble those of an hen; though the whole appearance bears a strong
re∣semblance to that of a camel. But to be more <PB REF="54"/>

<GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/> <PB N="50" REF="56"/>
particular; it is usually seven feet high from the top of the head to the
ground; but from the back it is only four; so that the head and neck are
above three feet long. From the top of the head to the rump, when the neck is
stretched out in a right line, it is six feet long, and the tail is about a
foot more. One of the wings, without the feathers, is a foot and an half; and
being stretched out, with the feathers, is three feet.</P>
<P>The plumage is much alike in all; that is, generally black and
white; though some of them are said to be grey. The greatest feathers are
at the extremities of the wings and tail, and the largest are generally
white. The next row is black and white; and of the small feathers, on the
back and belly, some are white and others black. There are no feathers on the
sides, nor yet on the thighs, nor under the wings. The lower part of the
neck, about half way, is covered with still smaller feathers than those
on the belly and back; and those, like the former, also are of different
colours.</P>
<P>All these feathers are of the same kind, and peculiar to the
ostrich; for other birds have several sorts, some of which are-soft
and downy, and others hard and strong. Ostrich feathers are almost all as
soft as down, being utterly <PB N="51" REF="57"/> unfit to serve the animal
for flying, and still less adapted to be a proper defence against
external in∣jury. The feathers of other birds have the webs broader on one
side than the other, but those of the ostrich have their shaft exactly
in the middle. The upper part of the head and neck are covered with a very fine
clear white hair, that shines like the bristles of a hog; and in some
places there are small tufts of it, consisting of about twelve hairs,
which grow from a single shaft about the thickness of a pin.</P>
<P>At the end of each wing, there is a kind of spur almost like
the quill of a porcupine. It is an inch long, being hollow and of an horny
substance. There are two of these on each wing; the largest of which is
at the extremity of the bone of the wing, and the other a foot lower. The neck
seems to be more slender in propor∣tion to that of other birds, from its
not being furnished with feathers. The skin in this part is of a livid
flesh colour, which some improperly would have to be blue. The bill is
short and pointed, and two inches and an half at the be∣ginning. The external
form of the eye is like that of a man, the upper eye-lid being adorned with
eye-lashes which are longer than those on the lid below. The tongue is
small, very short, <PB N="52" REF="58"/> and composed of cartilages,
ligaments, and membranes, intermixed with fleshy fibres. In some it is
about an inch long, and very thick at the bottom. In others it is but half an
inch, being a little forked at the end.</P>
<P>The thighs are very fleshy and large, being covered with a
white skin, inclining to redness, and wrinkled in the manner of a net,
whose meshes will admit the end of a finger. Some have very small
feathers here and there on the thighs; and others again have neither feathers
nor wrinkles. What are called the legs of birds in this are covered before with
large scales. The end of the foot is cloven, and has two very large toes,
which, like the leg, are covered with scales. These toes are of unequal
sizes. The largest, which is on the inside, is seven inches long,
including the claw, which is near three fourths of an inch in length, and
almost as broad. The other toe is but four inches long, and is without a
claw.</P>
<P>The internal parts of this animal are formed with no less
surprizing peculiarity. At the top of the breast, under the skin, the fat
is two inches thick; and on the fore-part of the belly, it is as hard as
suet, and about two inches and an half thick in some places. It has two
distinct stomachs. The first, which is lowermost, in 
<PB N="53" REF="59"/> its natural situation somewhat resembles the crop in
other birds; but it is considerably larger than the other stomach, and is
furnished with strong muscular fibres, as well circular as lon∣gitudinal.
The second stomach, or gizzard, has outwardly the shape of the stomach
of a man; and upon opening is always found filled with a variety of
discordant substances; hay, grass, barley, beans, bones, and stones,
some of which exceed in size a pullet's egg. The kidneys are eight inches
long and two broad, and differ from those of other birds in not being divided
into lobes. The heart and lungs are separated by a midriff, as in
quadrupedes; and the parts of generation also bear a very strong
resemblance and analogy.</P>
<P>Such is the structure of this animal forming the shade that
unites birds and quadrupedes; and from this structure its habits and manners
are entirely peculiar. It is a native only of the torrid regions of Africa, and
has long been celebrated by those who have had occasion to mention the
animals of that region. Its flesh is proscribed in Scripture as unfit to be
eaten; and most of the ancient writers describe it as well known in their
times. Like the race of the elephant, it is transmitted down without mixture;
and has never been known to breed <PB N="54" REF="60"/> out of that country
which first produced it. It seems formed to live among the sandy and
burn∣ing desarts of the torrid zone; and, as in some measure it owes its
birth to their genial in∣fluence, so it seldom migrates into tracts more
mild or more fertile. As that is the peculiar country of the elephant, the
rhinoceros, and camel, so it may readily be supposed capable of affording
a retreat to the ostrich. They inhabit from preference the most solitary
and horrid de∣serts, where there are few vegetables to cloath the surface
of the earth, and where the rain never comes to refresh it. The Arabians
assert that the ostrich never drinks; and the place of its ha∣bitation
seems to confirm the assertion. In these formidable regions,
ostriches are seen in large flocks, which to the distant spectator
appear like a regiment of cavalry, and have often alarmed a whole caravan.
There is no desert, how barren soever, but what is capable of supplying
these animals with provision; they eat almost every thing; and these
barren tracts are thus doubly grateful, as they afford both food and
security. The ostrich is of all other animals the most voracious. It will
devour leather, grass, hair, iron, stones, or any thing that is given. Nor
are its powers of digestion less in such things as are digestible.
Those substances which the <PB N="55" REF="61"/> coats of the stomach
cannot soften, pass whole; so that glass, stones, or iron, are
excluded in the form in which they were devoured. All metals, indeed, which are
swallowed by any animal, lose a part of their weight, and often the
extremities of their figure, from the action of the juices of the stomach
upon their surface. A quarter pistole, which was swallowed by a duck,
lost seven grains of its weight in the gizzard before it was voided; and it
is pro∣bable that a still greater diminution of weight would happen in the
stomach of an ostrich; considered in this light, therefore, this animal
may be said to digest iron; but such substances seldom remain long
enough in the stomach of any animal to undergo so tedious a
dissolution. However this be, the ostrich swallows almost every thing
presented to it. Whether this be from the necessity which smaller birds
are under of picking up gravel to keep the coats of their stomach asunder,
or whether it be from a want of distinguishing by the taste what
substances are fit and what incapable of digestion; certain it is, that
in the ostrich dissected by Ranby there appeared such a quantity of
heterogeneous sub∣stances, that it was wonderful how any animal could
digest such an overcharge of nourishment. Valisnieri also found the
first stomach filled with <PB N="56" REF="62"/> a quantity of incongruous
substances; grass, nuts, cords, stones, glass, brass, copper, iron,
tin, lead, and wood; a piece of stone was found among the rest that weighed
more than a pound. He saw one of these animals that was killed by devouring
a quantity of quick-lime. It would seem that the ostrich is obliged to fill
up the great capacity of its stomach in order to be at ease; but that
nutritious substances not oc∣curring, it pours in whatever offers to
supply the void.</P>
<P>In their native deserts, however, it is probable they live
chiefly upon vegetables, where they lead an inoffensive and social life;
the male, as Thevenot assures us, assorting with the female with
connubial fidelity. They are said to be very much inclined to venery; and the
make of the parts in both sexes seems to confirm the re∣port. It is
probable also they copulate, like other birds, by compression; and they
lay very large eggs, some of them being above five inches in diameter, and
weighing above fifteen pounds. These eggs have a very hard shell,
somewhat resembling those of the crocodile, except that those of the
latter are less and rounder.</P>
<P>The season for laying depends on the climate where the
animal is bred. In the northern parts <PB N="57" REF="63"/> of Africa, this
season is about the beginning of July; in the south, it is about the
latter end of December. These birds are very prolific, and lay generally from
forty to fifty eggs at one clutch. It has been commonly reported that the
female deposits them in the sand; and, covering them up, leaves them to be
hatched by the heat of the climate, and then permits the young to shift for
themselves. Very little of this however is true: no bird has a stronger
affection for her young than the ostrich, nor none watches her eggs with
greater assiduity. It happens, indeed, in those hot climates, that there
is less necessity for the continual incuba∣tion of the female; and she
more frequently leaves her eggs, which are in no fear of being chilled by the
weather: but though she some∣times forsakes them by day, she always
carefully broods over them by night; and Kolben, who has seen great numbers
of them at the Cape of Good Hope, affirms that they sit on their eggs like
other birds, and that the male and female take this office by turns, as he had
frequent opportunities of observing. Nor is it more true what is said of
their forsaking their young after they are excluded the shell. On the
contrary, the young ones are not even able to walk for several days after
they are hatched. During this <PB N="58" REF="64"/> time, the old ones are very
assiduous in supplying them with grass, and very careful to defend them
from danger: nay, they encounter every danger in their defence. It was a way of
take∣ing them among the ancients, to plant a number of sharp stakes round
the ostrich's nest in her absence, upon which she pierced herself at
her return. The young, when brought forth, are of an ash colour the first
year, and are covered with feathers all over. But in time these fea∣thers
drop; and those parts which are covered assume a different and more
becoming plumage.</P>
<P>The beauty of a part of this plumage, par∣ticularly the long
feathers that compose the wings and tail, is the chief reason that man has
been so active in pursuing this harmless bird to its deserts, and
hunting it with no small degree of expence and labour. The ancients used
those plumes in their helmets; the ladies of the east make them an ornament
in their dress; and among us, our undertakers and our fine gentle∣men still
make use of them to decorate their hearses and their hats. Those feathers
which are plucked from the animal while alive are much more valued than those
taken when dead, the latter being dry, light, and subject to be
worm-eaten.</P>
<P>Beside the value of their plumage, some of 
<PB N="59" REF="65"/> the savage nations of Africa, hunt them also for their
flesh; which they consider as a dainty. They sometimes also breed
these birds tame to eat the young ones, of which the female is said to be
the greatest delicacy. Some nations have obtained the name of Struthophagi,
or Ostrich∣eaters, from their peculiar fondness for this food; and even the
Romans themselves were not averse to it. Apicius gives us a receipt for
making sauce for the ostrich; and Heliogabalus is noted for having
dressed the brains of six hundred ostriches in one dish; for it was
his custom never to eat but of one dish in a day, but that was an
expensive one. Even among the Europeans now, the eggs of the ostrich are
said to be well tasted, and extremely nourishing; but they are too
scarce to be fed upon, al∣though a single egg be a sufficient
entertainment for eight men.</P>
<P>As the spoils of the ostrich are thus valuable, it is not to
be wondered at that man has become their most assiduous pursuer. For
this purpose, the Arabians train up their best and fleetest horses, and
hunt the ostrich still in view. Per∣haps, of all other varieties of the
chase, this, though the most laborious, is yet the most en∣tertaining. As
soon as the hunter comes within <PB N="60" REF="66"/> sight of his prey, he
puts on his horse with a gentle gallop, so as to keep the ostrich still
in sight; yet not so as to terrify him from the plain into the mountains.
Of all known animals that make use of their legs in running, the ostrich is
by far the swiftest: upon observing himself therefore pursued at a
distance, he begins to run at first but gently; either insensible of
his danger, or sure of escaping. In this situation he somewhat
resembles a man at full speed; his wings, like two arms, keep working with
a motion correspondent to that of his legs; and his speed would very soon
snatch him from the view of his pursuers, but, unfortunately for the
silly creature, instead of going off in a direct line, he takes his
course in circles; while the hunters still make a small course within,
relieve each other, meet him at unexpected turns, and keep him thus still
employed, still followed for two or three days together. At last, spent
with fatigue and famine, and finding all power of escape impossible, he
endeavours to hide himself from those enemies he cannot avoid, and covers
his head in the sand, or the first thicket he meets. Sometimes, however, he
attempts to face his pursuers; and, though in general the most gentle
animal in nature, when driven to desperation, he defends himself with 
<PB N="61" REF="67"/> his beak, his wings and his feet. Such is the force of his
motion, that a man would be ut∣terly unable to withstand him in the
shock.</P>
<P>The Struthophagi have another method of taking this bird: they
cover themselves with an ostrich's skin, and passing up an arm
through the neck, thus counterfeit all the motions of this animal. By this
artifice they approach the ostrich, which becomes an easy prey. He is
sometimes also taken by dogs and nets: but the most usual way is that
mentioned above.</P>
<P>When the Arabians have thus taken an ostrich, they cut its
throat, and making a liga∣ture below the opening, they shake the bird, as one
would rinse a barrel: then taking off the ligature, there runs out from the
wound in the throat, a considerable quantity of blood, mixed with the fat of
the animal; and this is considered as one of their greatest dainties. They
next flea the bird; and of the skin, which is strong and thick, sometimes
make a kind of vest, which answers the purposes of a cuirass and a
buckler.</P>
<P>There are others who, more compassionate or more provident,
do not kill their captive, but endeavour to tame it, for the purposes of
sup∣plying those feathers which are in so great re∣quest. The
inhabitants of Dara and Lybia breed up whole flocks of them, and they are tamed
<PB N="62" REF="68"/> with very little trouble. But it is not for their feathers
alone that they are prized in this do∣mestic state; they are often ridden
upon, and used as horses. Moore assures us, that at Joar he saw a man
travelling upon an ostrich; and Adanson asserts that, at the factory of
Podore, he had two ostriches, which were then young, the strongest of
which ran swifter than the best English racer, although he carried two
Negroes on his back. As soon as the animal perceived that it was thus loaded,
it set off running with all its force, and made several circuits round the
village; till at length the people were obliged to stop it, by barring up the
way. How far this strength and swiftness may be useful to mankind, even
in a polished state, is a matter that perhaps deserves enquiry.
Posterity may avail themselves of this creature's abilities; and riding
upon an ostrich may one day become the favourite, as it most certainly is
the swiftest, mode of conveyance.</P>
<P>The parts of this animal are said to be con∣vertible to many
salutary purposes in medicine. The fat is said to be emollient and
relaxing; that while it relaxes the tendons, it fortifies the nervous
system; and being applied to the region of the loins, it abates the pains
of the stone in the kidney. The shell of the egg powdered, 
<PB N="63" REF="69"/> and given in proper quantities, is said to be useful
in promoting urine, and dissolving the stone in the bladder. The
substance of the egg itself is thought to be peculiarly nourishing:
however, Galen, in mentioning this, asserts, that the eggs of hens and
pheasants are good to be eaten; those of geese and ostriches are the
worst of all.</P>

<PB N="64" REF="70"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. V. The Emu.</HEAD>
<P>OF this bird, which many call the American Ostrich, but little
is certainly known. It is an inhabitant of the New Continent; and the
tra∣vellers who have mentioned it, seem to have been more solicitous in
proving its affinity to the ostrich, than in describing those
peculiarities which distinguish it from all others of the fea∣thered
creation.</P>
<P>It is chiefly found in Guiana, along the banks of the Oroonoko,
in the inland provinces of Brasil and Chili, and the vast forests that
border on the mouth of the river Plata. Many other parts of South America were
known to have them; but as men multiplied, these large and timorous birds
either fell beneath their superior power, or fled from their vicinity.</P>
<P>The Emu, though not so large as the ostrich, is only
second to it in magnitude. It is by much the largest bird in the New
Continent; and is generally found to be six feet high, mea∣suring from its
head to the ground. Its legs are three feet long; and its thigh is near as
thick as that of a man. The toes differ from those <PB N="65" REF="71"/> of
the ostrich; as there are three in the Ame∣rican bird, and but two in the
former. Its neck is long, its head small, and the bill flat∣ted, like that of
the ostrich; but, in all other respects, it more resembles a
Cassowary, a large bird, to be described hereafter. The form of the body
appears round; the wings are short, and entirely unfitted for flying, and it
entirely wants a tail. It is covered from the back and rump with long feathers,
which fall backward, and cover the anus: these feathers are grey upon the
back, and white on the belly. It goes very swiftly, and seems
assisted in its motion by a kind of tubercle behind, like an heel, upon
which, on plain ground, it treads very securely: in its course it uses a
very odd kind of action, lifting up one wing, which it keeps elevated for a
time; till letting it drop, it lifts up the other. What the bird's intention
may be in thus keeping only one wing up, is not easy to discover; whe∣ther
it makes use of this as a sail to catch the wind, or whether as a rudder to
turn its course, in order to avoid the arrows of the Indians, yet remains to
be ascertained: however this be, the emu runs with such a swiftness,
that the fleetest dogs are thrown out in the pursuit. One of them, finding
itself surrounded by the hunters, darted among the dogs with such fury
that they <PB N="66" REF="72"/> made way to avoid its rage; and it escaped, by
its amazing velocity, in safety to the mountains.</P>
<P>As this bird is but little known, so travellers have given a
loose to their imaginations in de∣scribing some of its actions, which
they were conscious could not be easily contradicted. This animal, says
Nierenberg, is very peculiar in the hatching of its young. The male com∣pels
twenty or thirty of the females to lay their eggs in one nest; he then, when
they have done laying, chases them away, and places himself upon the eggs;
however, he takes the singular precaution of laying two of the number
aside, which he does not sit upon. When the young ones come forth, these
two eggs are addled; which the male having foreseen, breaks one, and then
another, upon which multitudes of flies are found to settle; and these
supply the young brood with a sufficiency of provision, till they are
able to shift for themselves.</P>
<P>On the other hand, Wafer asserts, that he has seen great
quantities of this animal's eggs on the desert shores, north of the river
Plata; where they were buried in the sand, in order to be hatched by the heat
of the climate. Both this, as well as the preceding account, may be doubted:
and it is more probable that it was the crocodile's eggs which Wafer had
seen, which are undoubtedly hatched in that manner.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="73"/>When the young ones are hatched, they are
familiar, and follow the first person they meet. I have been followed
myself, says Wafer, by many of these young ostriches; which, at
first, are extremely harmless and simple: but as they grow older, they
become more cunning and distrustful; and run so swift, that a greyhound
can scarcely overtake them. Their flesh, in general, is good to be eaten;
especially if they be young. It would be no difficult matter to rear up
flocks of these animals tame, particularly as they are naturally so
familiar: and they might be found to answer domestic purposes, like the
hen, or the turkey. Their maintenance could not be expensive, if, as
Narborough says, they live entirely upon grass.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. The Cassowary.</HEAD>
<P>THE Cassowary is a bird which was first brought into
Europe by the Dutch, from Java, in the East-Indies, in which part of the
world it is only to be found. Next to the preceding, it is the largest and
the heaviest of the feathered species.</P>
<P>The cassowary, though not so large as the former, yet
appears more bulky to the eye; its body being nearly equal, and its neck and
legs much thicker and stronger in proportion; this conformation gives it an
air of strength and force, which the fierceness and singularity of its
countenance conspire to render formidable. It is five feet and an half long,
from the point of the bill to the extremity of the claws. The legs are two feet
and an half high, from the belly to the end of the claws. The head and neck
to∣gether are a foot and an half; and the largest toe, including the claw, is
five inches long. The claw alone of the least toe, is three inches and a half
in length. The wing is so small, that it does not appear; it being hid
under the feathers of the back. In other birds, a part of <PB N="69" REF="77"/>
the feathers serve for flight, and are different from those that serve
for merely covering; but in the cassowary, all the feathers are of the
same kind, and outwardly of the same colour. They are generally double;
having two long shafts, which grow out of a short one, which is fixed in
the skin. Those that are double, are always of an unequal length; for
some are fourteen inches long, particularly on the rump; while others are not
above three. The beards that adorn the stem or shaft, are from about half
way to the end, very long, and as thick as an horse hair, without being
subdivided into fibres. The stem or shaft is flat, shining, black, and
knotted below; and from each knot there pro∣ceeds a beard: likewise, the
beards at the end of the large feathers are perfectly black; and towards the
root of a grey tawny colour; shorter, more soft, and throwing out fine
fibres, like down; so that nothing appears except the ends, which are hard
and black; because the other part, composed of down, is quite covered.
There are feathers on the head and neck; but they are so short, and thinly
sown, that the bird's skin appears naked, except towards the hinder part of
the head, where they are a little longer. The feathers which adorn the rump,
are extremely thick; but do not differ, in other <PB N="70" REF="78"/>
respects, from the rest, excepting their being longer. The wings, when they
are deprived of their feathers, are but three inches long; and the feathers are
like those on other parts of the body. The ends of the wings are adorned with
five prickles, of different lengths and thickness, which bend like a bow:
these are hollow from the roots to the very points, having only that slight
substance within which all quills are known to have. The longest of
these prickles is eleven inches; and it is a quarter of an inch in diameter
at the root, being thicker there than towards the extremity; the point seems
broken off.</P>
<P>The part, however, which most distinguishes this animal is
the head; which, though small, like that of an ostrich, does not fail to
inspire some degree of terror. It is bare of feathers, and is in a manner
armed with an helmet of horny substance, that covers it from the root of
the bill to near half the head backwards. This helmet is black before and
yellow behind. Its substance is very hard, being formed by the elevation of
the bone of the skull; and it consists of several plates, one over
another, like the horn of an ox. Some have supposed that this was shed
every year with the feathers; but the most probable opinion is, that it only
ex∣foliates <PB N="71" REF="79"/> slowly like the beak. To the peculiar oddity
of this natural armour may be added the colour of the eye in this animal, which
is a bright yellow, and the globe being above an inch and an half in diameter,
give it an air equally fierce and extraordinary. At the bot∣tom of the upper
eye-lid, there is a row of small hairs, over which there is another row of
black hair, which look pretty much like an eye-brow. The lower eye-lid, which
is the largest of the two, is furnished also with plenty of black hair.
The hole of the ear is very large and open, being only covered with small
black feathers. The sides of the head, about the eye and ear, being
destitute of any covering, are blue, except the middle of the lower eye-lid,
which is white. The part of the bill which answers to the upper jaw in other
animals, is very hard at the edges above, and the extremity of it like that of
a turkey-cock. The end of the lower mandible is slightly notched, and the
whole is of a greyish brown, except a green spot on each side. As the
beak admits a very wide opening, this con∣tributes not a little to the bird's
menacing ap∣pearance. The neck is of a violet colour, in∣clining to that of
slate; and it is red behind in several places, but chiefly in the middle.
About the middle of the neck before, at the rise of the <PB N="72" REF="80"/>
large feathers, there are two processes formed by the skin, which
resemble somewhat the gills of a cock, but that they are blue as well as
red. The skin which covers the fore-part of the breast, on which this bird
leans and rests, is hard, callous, and without feathers. The thighs and legs
are covered with feathers, and are ex∣tremely thick, strong, straight, and
covered with scales of several shapes; but the legs are thicker a little
above the foot than in any other place. The toes are likewise covered with
scales, and are but three in number; for that which should be behind is
wanting. The claws are of a hard solid substance, black without and white
within.</P>
<P>The internal parts are equally remarkable. The cassowary
unites with the double stomach of animals that live upon vegetables, the
short intestines of those that live upon flesh. The in∣testines of
the cassowary are thirteen times shorter than those of the ostrich.
The heart is very small, being but an inch and an half long, and an inch
broad at the base. Upon the whole, it has the head of a warrior, the eye of a
lion, the defence of a porcupine, and the swiftness of a courser.</P>
<P>Thus formed for a life of hostility, for ter∣rifying others,
and for its own defence, it might be expected that the cassowary was one of
the <PB N="73" REF="81"/> most fierce and terrible animals of the creation.
But nothing is so opposite to its natural character, nothing so different
from the life it is contented to lead. It never attacks others; and instead
of the bill, when attacked, it rather makes use of its legs, and kicks like
an horse, or runs against its pursuer, beats him down, and treads him to
the ground.</P>
<P>The manner of going of this animal is not less extraordinary
than its appearance. Instead of going directly forward, it seems to kick up
behind with one leg, and then making a bound onward with the other, it goes
with such pro∣digious velocity, that the swiftest racer would be left far
behind.</P>
<P>The same degree of voraciousness which we perceived in the
ostrich, obtains as strongly here. The cassowary swallows every thing
that comes within the capacity of its gullet. The Dutch assert that it can
devour not only glass, iron, and stones, but even live and burning coals,
without testifying the smallest fear, or feeling the least injury. It
is said that the passage of the food through its gullet is performed so
speedily, that even the very eggs which it has swallowed whole pass
through it unbroken, in the same form they went down. In fact, the alimentary
canal of this animal, as was observed <PB N="74" REF="82"/> above, is
extremely short; and it may happen that many kinds of food are indigestible
in its stomach, as wheat or currants are to man, when swallowed whole.</P>
<P>The cassowary's eggs are of a grey ash colour, inclining
to green. They are not so large nor so round as those of the ostrich.
They are marked with a number of little tubercles of a deep green, and the
shell is not very thick. The largest of these is found to be fifteen
inches round one way, and about twelve the other.</P>
<P>The southern parts of the most eastern Indies seems to
be the natural climate of the cassowary. His domain, if we may so call
it, begins where that of the ostrich terminates. The latter has never been
found beyond the Ganges; while the cassowary is never seen nearer than
the islands of Banda, Sumatra, Java, the Molucca Islands, and the
corresponding parts of the continent. Yet even here this animal seems not
to have multiplied in any considerable degree, as we find one of the kings of
Java making a present of one of these birds to the captain of a Dutch
ship, considering it as a very great rarity. The ostrich, that has kept
in the desert and unpeopled regions of Africa, is still numerous, and the
unrivalled tenant of its own inhospitable cli∣mate. But the cassowary,
that is the inhabi∣tant <PB REF="83"/>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. The Dodo.</HEAD>
<P>MANKIND have generally made swiftness the attribute of
birds; but the Dodo has no title to this distinction. Instead of exciting
the idea of swiftness by its appearance, it seems to strike the
imagination as a thing the most un∣wieldy and inactive of all nature. Its
body is massive, almost round, and covered with grey feathers; it is
just barely supported upon two short thick legs like pillars, while its
head and neck rise from it in a manner truly grotesque. The neck, thick and
pursy, is joined to the head, which consists of two great chaps, that
open far behind the eyes, which are large, black and pro∣minent; so that the
animal when it gapes seems to be all mouth. The bill therefore is of an
ex∣traordinary length, not flat and broad, but thick, and of a bluish white,
sharp at the end, and each chap crooked in opposite directions. They
re∣semble two pointed spoons that are laid together by the backs. From all
this results a stupid and voracious physiognomy; which is still more
en∣creased by a bordering of feathers round the root of the beak, and which
give the appearance of an <PB REF="88"/>

cowl, and finish this picture of stupid de∣formity. Bulk, which in other
animals implies strength, in this only contributes to inactivity. The
ostrich, or the cassowary, are no more able to fly than the animal before
us; but then they supply that defect by their speed in running. The dodo
seems weighed down by its own hea∣viness, and has scarce strength to
urge itself forward. It seems among birds what the sloth is among
quadrupedes, an unresisting thing, equally incapable of flight or defence.
It is furnished with wings, covered with soft ash-coloured feathers, but
they are too short to assist it in flying. It is furnished with a
tail, with a few small curled feathers; but this tail is dis∣proportioned
and displaced. Its legs are too short for running, and its body too fat to
be strong. One would take it for a tortoise that had supplied itself
with the feathers of a bird; and that thus dressed out with the
instruments of flight, it was only still the more unwieldy.</P>
<P>This bird is a native of the Isle of France; and the Dutch,
who first discovered it there, called it in their language the
<HI>nauseous bird,</HI> as well from its disgusting figure as from the
bad taste of its flesh. However, succeeding observers contradict this
first report, and assert that its flesh is good and wholesome eating.
It is a silly <PB N="78" REF="92"/> simple bird, as may very well be
supposed from its figure, and is very easily taken. Three or four dodos
are enough to dine an hundred men.</P>
<P>Whether the dodo be the same bird with that which some
travellers have described under the bird of Nazareth, yet remains uncertain.
The country from whence they both come is the same; their incapacity of
flying is the same; the form of the wings and body in both are similar; but
the chief difference given is in the colour of the feathers, which in the
female of the bird of Nazareth are said to be extremely beautiful; and in the
length of their legs, which in the dodo are short; in the other, are
described as long. Time and future observation must clear up these
doubts; and the testimony of a single witness, who shall have seen
both, will throw more light on the subject than the rea∣sonings of an
hundred philosophers.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. Of Rapacious Birds in General.</HEAD>
<P>THERE seems to obtain a general resem∣blance in all the
classes of nature. As among quadrupedes a part were seen to live upon the
vegetable productions of the earth, and another part upon the flesh of each
other, so among birds; some live upon vegetable food, and others by rapine,
destroying all such as such as want force or swiftness to procure
their safety. By thus peopling the woods with animals of different
dispositions, Nature has wisely pro∣vided for the multiplication of life;
since, could we suppose that there were as many ani∣mals produced as
there were vegetables supplied to sustain them, yet there might still
be another class of animals formed, which could find a sufficient
sustenance by feeding upon such of the vegetable feeders as happened to
fall by the course of nature. By this contrivance, a greater number will be
sustained upon the whole; for the numbers would be but very thin were every
creature a candidate for the same food. Thus, by supplying a variety of
appetites, Nature has also multiplied life in her productions.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="94"/>In thus varying their appetites, Nature has
also varied the form of the animal; and while she has given some an
instinctive passion for animal food, she has also furnished them
with powers to obtain it. All land-birds of the ra∣pacious kinds are
furnished with a large head, and a strong crooked beak, notched at the end,
for the purpose of tearing their prey. They have strong short legs, and
sharp crooked talons for the purpose of seizing it. Their bodies are
formed for war, being fibrous and muscular; and their wings for swiftness
of flight, being well feathered and expansive. The sight of such as prey
by day is astonishingly quick; and such as ravage by night, have their
sight so fitted as to see objects in darkness with extreme
precision.</P>
<P>Their internal parts are equally formed for the food they seek
for. Their stomach is simple and membranous, and wrapped in fat to
encrease the powers of digestion; and their intestines are short and
glandular. As their food is suc∣culent and juicy, they want no length of
inte∣stinal tube to form it into proper nourishment. Their food is flesh;
which does not require a slow digestion, to be converted into a
similitude of substance to their own.</P>
<P>Thus formed for war, they lead a life of so∣litude 
<PB N="81" REF="95"/> and rapacity. They inhabit, by choice, the most lonely
places and the most desert mountains. They make their nests in the clefts
of rocks, and on the highest and most inacces∣sible trees of the
forest. Whenever they appear in the cultivated plain, or the warbling grove,
it is only for the purposes of depredation; and are gloomy intruders on the
general joy of the landscape. They spread terror wherever they approach:
all that variety of music which but a moment before enlivened the grove, at
their appearing is instantly at an end: every order of lesser birds
seek for safety, either by con∣cealment or flight; and some are even
driven to take protection with man, to avoid their less merciful
pursuers.</P>
<P>It would indeed be fatal to all the smaller race of birds, if,
as they are weaker than all, they were also pursued by all; but it is
con∣trived wisely for their safety, that every order of carnivorous birds
seek only for such as are of the size most approaching their own. The
ea∣gle flies at the bustard or the pheasant; the sparrow-hawk pursues
the thrush and the lin∣net. Nature has provided that each species should
make war only on such as are furnished with adequate means of escape. The
smallest birds avoid their pursuers by the extreme agi∣lity, 
<PB N="82" REF="96"/> rather than the swiftness of their flight; for every
order would soon be at an end, if the eagle, to its own swiftness of
wing, added the versality of the sparrow.</P>
<P>Another circumstance which tends to render the tyranny of
these animals more supportable is, that they are less fruitful than other
birds; breeding but few at a time. Those of the larger kind seldom produce
above four eggs, often but two; those of the smaller kinds, never above
six or seven. The pigeon, it is true, that is their prey, never breeds
above two at a time; but then she breeds every month in the year. The
carnivorous kinds only breed annually, and of consequence their fecundity is
small in com∣parison.</P>
<P>As they are fierce by nature, and are difficult to be tamed,
so this fierceness extends even to their young, which they force from the
nest sooner than birds of the gentler kind. Other birds seldom forsake
their young till able, com∣pletely, to provide for themselves; the rapacious
kinds expel them from the nest at a time when they still should protect
and support them. This severity to their young proceeds from the
necessity of providing for themselves. All animals that, by the
conformation of their stomach and intestines, are obliged to live upon
flesh, and <PB N="83" REF="97"/> support themselves by prey, though they
may be mild when young, soon become fierce and mischievous, by the very
habit of using those arms with which they are supplied by Nature. As it
is only by the destruction of other animals that they can subsist, they
become more furious every day; and even the parental feelings are overpowered
in their general habits of cruelty. If the power of obtaining a supply be
difficult, the old ones soon drive their brood from the nest to shift for
themselves, and often destroy them in a fit of fury caused by hunger.</P>
<P>Another effect of this natural and acquired severity is, that
almost all birds of prey are unsociable. It has long been observed, by
Aristotle, that all birds, with crooked beaks and talons, are solitary:
like quadrupedes of the cat kind, they lead a lonely wandering life, and are
united only in pairs, by that instinct which overpowers their rapacious
habits of enmity with all other animals. As the male and female are often
necessary to each other in their pursuits, so they sometimes live
together; but, except at certain seasons, they most usually prowl
alone; and, like robbers, enjoy in so∣litude the fruits of their plunder.</P>
<P>All birds of prey are remarkable for one <PB N="84" REF="98"/>
singularity, for which it is not easy to account. All the males of these
birds are about a third less, and weaker than the females; contrary to what
obtains among quadrupedes, among which the males are always the largest and
boldest: from thence the male is called, by falconers, a <HI>tarcel</HI>;
that is, a tierce or third less than the other. The reason of this
difference cannot proceed from the necessity of a larger body in the
fe∣male for the purposes of breeding, and that her volume is thus encreased
by the quantity of her eggs; for in other birds, that breed much faster, and
that lay in much greater proportion, such as the hen, the duck, or the
pheasant, the male is by much the largest of the two. What∣ever be the
cause, certain it is, that the females, as Willoughby expresses it, are
of greater size, more beautiful and lovely for shape and colours,
stronger, more fierce and generous, than the males; whether it may be that it
is necessary for the female to be thus superior; as it is incumbent upon
her to provide, not only for herself, but her young ones also.</P>
<P>These birds, like quadrupedes of the car∣nivorous kind, are
all lean and meagre. Their flesh is stringy and ill-tasted, soon
corrupting, and tinctured with the flavour of that animal <PB N="85" REF="99"/>
food upon which they subsist. Nevertheless, Belonius asserts, that
many people admire the flesh of the vulture and falcon, and dress them for
eating, when they meet with any accident that unfits them for the chace. He
asserts, that the Osprey, a species of the eagle, when young, is
excellent food; but he contents himself with advising us, to breed these
birds up for our pleasure rather in the field, than for the table.</P>
<P>Of land birds of a rapacious nature, there are five kinds. The
eagle kind, the hawk kind, the vulture kind, the horned, the screech owl
kind. The distinctive marks of this class, are taken from their claws and
beak: their toes are separated: their legs are feathered to the heel: their
toes are four in number; three before, one behind: their beak is short, thick
and crooked.</P>
<P>The eagle kind is distinguished from the rest by his beak,
which is straight till towards the end, when it begins to hook downwards.</P>
<P>The vulture kind is distinguished by the head and neck: he
is without feathers.</P>
<P>The hawk kind by the beak; being hooked from the very root.</P>
<P>The horned owl by the feathers at the base 
<PB N="86" REF="100"/> of the bill standing forwards; and by some feathers
on the head, that stand out, resembling horns.</P>

<P><PB N="87" REF="102"/> THE Golden Eagle is the largest and the
noblest of all those birds that have received the name of Eagle. It weighs
above twelve pounds. Its length is three feet; the extent of its wings, seven
feet four inches; the bill is three inches long, and of a deep blue colour; and
the eye of an hazel colour. The sight and sense of smelling are very
acute. The head and neck are cloathed with narrow sharp pointed fea∣thers,
and of a deep brown colour, bordered with tawny; but those on the crown of
the head, in very old birds, turn grey. The whole body, above as well as
beneath, is of a dark brown; and the feathers of the back are finely clouded
with a deeper shade of the same. The wings when cloathed reach to the end
of the tail. The quill feathers are of a chocolate co∣lour, the shafts white.
The tail is of a deep brown, irregularly barred and blotched with an obscure
ash-colour, and usually white at the roots of the feathers. The legs are
yellow, short, and very strong, being three inches in circumference, and
feathered to the very feet. <PB REF="103"/>

<GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/> <PB N="88" REF="105"/> The toes
are covered with large scales, and armed with the most formidable claws,
the middle of which are two inches long.</P>
<P>In the rear of this terrible bird follow the the <HI>ring tailed
eagle,</HI> the <HI>common eagle,</HI> the <HI>bald eagle,</HI> the <HI>white
eagle,</HI> the <HI>kough-footed eagle,</HI> the <HI>erne,</HI> the <HI>black
eagle,</HI> the <HI>osprey,</HI> the <HI>sea-eagle,</HI> and the
<HI>crowned eagle.</HI> These, and others that might be added, form different
shades in this fierce family; but have all the same rapacity, the same
general form, the same habits, and the same manner of bringing up their
young.</P>
<P>In general, these birds are found in moun∣tainous and
ill-peopled countries, and breed among the loftiest cliffs. They chuse
those places which are remotest from man, upon whose possessions
they but seldom make their depredations, being contented rather to follow the
wild game in the forest than to risque their safety to satisfy their
hunger.</P>
<P>This fierce animal may be considered among birds as the lion
among quadrupedes; and in many respects they have a strong similitude to
each other. They are both possessed of force, and an empire over their
fellows of the forest. Equally magnanimous, they disdain smaller plunder;
and only pursue animals worthy the conquest. It is not till after having
been long <PB N="89" REF="106"/> provoked, by the cries of the rook or the
magpie, that this generous bird thinks fit to punish them with death: the
eagle also disdains to share the plunder of another bird; and will take
up with no other prey but that which he has acquired by his own pursuits. How
hungry soever he may be, he never stoops to carrion; and when satiated,
he never returns to the same carcass, but leaves it for other animals, more
rapacious and less delicate than he. Solitary, like the lion, he keeps the
desart to himself alone; it is as extraordinary to see two pair of eagles
in the same mountain, as two lions in the same forest. They keep
separate, to find a more ample supply; and consider the quantity of their
game as the best proof of their dominion. Nor does the similitude of
these animals stop here: they have both spark∣ling eyes, and nearly of
the same colour; their claws are of the same form, their breath equally
strong, and their cry equally loud and terrifying. Bred both for war, they
are enemies of all society: alike fierce, proud, and incapable of being
easily tamed. It requires great patience and much art to tame an eagle; and
even though taken young, and brought under by long assiduity, yet still
it is a dangerous domestic, and often turns its force against its master.
When <PB N="90" REF="107"/> brought into the field for the purposes of
fowling, the falconer is never sure of its attachment: that innate pride, and
love of liberty, still prompt it to regain its native solitudes; and the
moment the falconer sees it, when let loose, first stoop towards the
ground, and then rise perpendi∣cularly into the clouds, he gives up all his
for∣mer labour for lost; quite sure of never beholding his late prisoner
more. Sometimes, however, they are brought to have an attachment for their
feeder: they are then highly serviceable, and liberally provide for his
pleasures and support. When the falconer lets them go from his hand, they
play about and hover round him till their game presents, which they see at
an immense distance, and pursue with certain de∣struction.</P>
<P>Of all animals the eagle flies highest; and from thence the
ancients have given him the epithet of <HI>the bird of Heaven.</HI> Of all
others also, he has the quickest eye; but his sense of smelling is
far inferior to that of the vulture. He never pursues, therefore, but in
sight; and when he has seized his prey, he stoops from his height, as if
to examine its weight, always lay∣ing it on the ground before he carries it
off. As his wing is very powerful, yet, as he has but little suppleness in
the joints of the leg, he <PB N="91" REF="108"/> finds it difficult to rise
when down; however, if not instantly pursued, he finds no difficulty in
carrying off geese and cranes. He also car∣ries away hares, lambs, and
kids; and often destroys fawns and calves, to drink their blood, and carries
a part of their flesh to his retreat. Infants themselves, when left
unattended, have been destroyed by these rapacious creatures; which
probably gave rise to the fable of Gany∣mede's being snatched up by an
eagle to heaven.</P>
<P>An instance is recorded in Scotland of two children being
carried off by eagles; but fortu∣nately they received no hurt by the way; and,
the eagles being pursued, the children were re∣stored unhurt out of the
nests to the affrighted parents.</P>
<P>The eagle is thus at all times a formidable neighbour; but
peculiarly when bringing up its young. It is then that the female, as well as
the male, exert all their force and in∣dustry to supply their young. Smith,
in his History of Kerry, relates, that a poor man in that country got a
comfortable subsistence for his family, during a summer of famine, out
of an eagle's nest, by robbing the eaglets of food, which was plentifully
supplied by the old ones. He protracted their assiduity beyond the
usual <PB N="92" REF="109"/> time, by clipping the wings, and retarding the
flight of the young; and very probably also, as I have known myself, by
so tying them as to encrease their cries, which is always found to
encrease the parent's dispatch to procure them provision. It was lucky,
however, that the old eagles did not surprize the countryman as he was thus
employed, as their resentment might have been dangerous.</P>
<P>It happened some time ago, in the same country, that a
peasant resolved to rob the nest of an eagle, that had built in a small
island, in the beautiful lake of Killarney. He accord∣ingly stripped, and
swam in upon the island while the old ones were away; and, robbing the
nest of its young, he was preparing to swim back, with the eaglets tied in
a string; but, while he was yet up to his chin in the water, the old eagles
returned, and, missing their young, quickly fell upon the plunderer, and,
in spite of all his resistance, dispatched him with their beaks and
talons.</P>
<P>In order to extirpate these pernicious birds, there is a law
in the Orkney Islands which en∣titles any person that kills an eagle to a
hen out of every house in the parish in which the plunderer is killed.</P>
<P>The nest of the eagle is usually built in the most
inaccessible cliff of the rock, and often <PB N="93" REF="110"/> shielded
from the weather by some jutting crag that hangs over it. Sometimes, however,
it is wholly exposed to the winds, as well side∣ways as above; for the
nest is flat, though built with great labour. It is said that the same
nest serves the eagle during life; and indeed the pains bestowed in
forming it seems to argue as much. One of these was found in the Peak of
Derbyshire; which Willoughby thus describes. 
<Q REND="inline">"It was made of great sticks, resting one
end on the edge of a rock, the other on two birch-trees. Upon these was a
layer of rushes, and over them a layer of heath, and upon the heath rushes
again; upon which lay one young one, and an addle egg; and by them a lamb, a
hare, and three heath-pouts. The nest was about two yards square, and had
no hollow in it. The young eagle was of the shape of a goshawk, of almost
the weight of a goose, rough footed, or feathered down to the foot, having a
white ring about the tail."</Q> Such is the place where the female eagle
de∣posits her eggs; which seldom exceed two at a time in the larger
species, and not above three in the smallest. It is said that she
hatches them for thirty days: but frequently, even of this small number of
eggs, a part is addled; and it is extremely rare to find three eaglets in the 
<PB N="94" REF="111"/> same nest. It is asserted, that as soon as the
young ones are somewhat grown, the mother kills the most feeble or the
most voracious. If this happens, it must proceed only from the
necessities of the parent, who is incapable of providing for their
support; and is content to sacrifice a part to the welfare of all.</P>
<P>The plumage of the eaglets is not so strongly marked as when
they come to be adult. They are at first white; then inclining to yellow; and
at last of light brown. Age, hunger, long cap∣tivity, and diseases, make
them whiter. It is said, they live above an hundred years; and that they at
last die, not of old age, but from the beaks turning inward upon the under
man∣dible, and thus preventing their taking any food. They are equally
remarkable, says Mr. Penant, for their longevity, and for their power of
sustaining a long absence from food. One of this species, which has now
been nine years in the possession of Mr. Owen Holland, of Con∣way,
lived thirty-two years with the gentleman who made him a present of it; but
what its age was when the latter received it from Ireland, is unknown. The
same bird also furnishes a proof of the truth of the other remark; having
once, through the neglect of servants, endured hunger for twenty-one days,
without any sustenance whatever.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="112"/>Those eagles which are kept tame, are fed
with every kind of flesh, whether fresh or cor∣rupting; and when there is a
deficiency of that, bread, or any other provision, will suffice. It is very
dangerous approaching them if not quite tame; and they sometimes send forth
a loud piercing lamentable cry, which renders them still more formidable. The
eagle drinks but seldom; and perhaps, when at liberty, not at all, as the
blood of his prey serves to quench his thirst. His excrements are always
soft and moist, and tinged with that whitish substance which, as was
said before, mixes in birds with the urine.</P>
<P>Such are the general characteristics and ha∣bitudes of the
eagle; however, in some these habitudes differ, as the Sea Eagle and the
Os∣prey live chiefly upon fish, and consequently build their nests on
the sea-shore, and by the sides of rivers, on the ground among reeds; and
often lay three or four eggs, rather less than those of a hen, of a white
eliptical form. They catch their prey, which is chiefly fish, by darting down
upon them from above. The Italians compare the violent descent of these
birds on their prey, to the fall of lead into water; and call them Aquilla
Piombina, or the Leaden Eagle.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="113"/>Nor is the Bald Eagle, which is an
inha∣bitant of North Carolina, less remarkable for habits peculiar to
itself. These birds breed in that country all the year round. When the
eaglets are just covered with down and a sort of white wooly feathers, the
female eagle lays again. These eggs are left to be hatched by the warmth of
the young ones that continue in the nest; so that the flight of one brood
makes room for the next, that are but just hatched. These birds fly very
heavily; so that they cannot overtake their prey, like others of the same
denomination. To remedy this, they often attend a sort of fishing-hawk,
which they pursue, and strip the plunderer of its prey. This is the more
remarkable, as this hawk flies swifter than they. These eagles also
generally attend upon fowlers in the winter; and when any birds are wounded,
they are sure to be seized by the eagle, though they may fly from the
fowler. This bird will often also steal young pigs, and carry them alive to
the nest, which is composed of twigs, sticks and rub∣bish: it is large
enough to fill the body of a cart; and is commonly full of bones half eaten,
and putrid flesh, the stench of which is in∣tolerable.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X. The Condor of America.</HEAD>
<P>WE might now come to speak of the vulture kind, as they hold
the next rank to the eagle; but we are interrupted in our method, by the
consideration of an enormous bird, whose place is not yet ascertained; as
naturalists are in doubt whether to refer it to the eagle tribe, or to that
of the vulture. Its great strength, force, and vivacity, might plead for its
place among the former; the baldness of its head and neck might be thought to
degrade it among the latter. In this uncertainty, it will be enough to
describe the bird, by the lights we have, and leave fu∣ture historians to
settle its rank in the feathered creation. Indeed, if size and strength,
com∣bined with rapidity of flight and rapacity, de∣serve pre-eminence, no
bird can be put in com∣petition with it.</P>
<P>The Condor possesses, in an higher degree than the
eagle, all the qualities that render it formidable, not only to the feathered
kind, but to beasts, and even to man himself. Acosta, Garcilasso, and
Desmarchais, assert, that it is eighteen feet across, the wings
extended. <PB N="101" REF="121"/> The beak is so strong as to pierce the
body of a cow; and two of them are able to devour it. They do not even
abstain from man himself: but fortunately there are but few of the
spe∣cies; for if they had been plenty, every order of animals must have
carried on an unsuc∣cessful war against them. The Indians assert,
that they will carry off a deer, or a young calf, in their talons, as eagles
would an hare or a rabbit; that their sight is piercing, and their air
terrible; that they seldom frequent the forests, as they require a large
space for the display of their wings; but that they are found on the
sea-shore, and the banks of rivers, whither they descend from their
heights of the mountains. By later accounts we learn, that they come down to
the sea-shore only at certain seasons, when their prey happens to fail
them upon land; that they then feed upon dead fish, and such other
nutritious substances as the sea throws up on the shore. We are
assured, however, that their countenance is not so terrible as the old
writers have represented it; but that they ap∣pear of a milder nature than
either the eagle or the vulture.</P>
<P>Condamine has frequently seen them in several parts of the
mountains of Quito, and observed them hovering over a flock of sheep; and
he <PB N="102" REF="122"/> thinks they would, at a certain time, have at∣tempted
to carry one off, had they not been scared away by the shepherds. Labat
acquaints us, that those who have seen this animal, declare that the body
is as large as that of a sheep; and that the flesh is tough, and as
disagreeable as carrion. The Spaniards themselves seem to dread its
depredations; and there have been many instances of its carrying off their
children.</P>
<P>Mr. Strong, the master of a ship, as he was sailing along
the coasts of Chili, in the thirty-third degree of south latitude,
observed a bird sitting upon a high cliff near the shore, which some of
the ship's company shot with a leaden bullet and killed. They were greatly
surprized when they beheld its magnitude; for when the wings were extended,
they measured thirteen feet from one tip to the other. One of the quills was
two feet four inches long; and the barrel, or hollow part, was six inches and
three quarters, and an inch and an half in circum∣ference.</P>
<P>We have a still more circumstantial account of this amazing
bird, by P. Feuillée, the only traveller who has accurately described
it: 
<Q REND="inline">"In the valley of Ilo in Peru, I discovered a
con∣dor, perched on a high rock before me: I approached within gun-shot and
fired; but, <PB N="103" REF="123"/> as my piece was only charged with
swan-shot, the lead was not able sufficiently to pierce the bird's
feathers. I perceived, however, by its manner of flying, that it was wounded;
and it was with a good deal of difficulty that it flew to another rock, about
five hundred yards distant on the sea-shore. I therefore charged again
with ball, and hit the bird under the throat, which made it mine. I accordingly
ran up to seize it; but, even in death it was terrible, and defended itself
upon its back, with its claws extended against me, so that I scarce knew
how to lay hold of it. Had it not been mortally wounded, I should have found
it no easy matter to take it; but I at last dragged it down from the rock,
and with the assistance of one of the seamen, I carried it to my tent,
to make a coloured drawing. 
<P> "The wings of this bird, which I measured very exactly,
were twelve feet three inches (English) from tip to tip. The great fea∣thers,
that were of a beautiful shining black, were two feet four inches long. The
thick∣ness of the beak was proportionable to the rest of the body; the
length about four inches; the point hooked downwards, and white at its
extremity; and the other part <PB N="104" REF="124"/> was of a jet black. A
short down, of a brown colour, covered the head; the eyes were black, and
surrounded with a circle of red∣dish brown. The feathers, on the breast,
neck and wings, were of a light brown; those on the back were rather darker.
Its thighs were covered with brown feathers to the knee. The thigh bone was ten
inches long; the leg five inches: the toes were three before, and one behind:
that behind was an inch and an half; and the claw with which it was armed, was
black, and three quarters of an inch. The other claws were in the same
proportion; and the leg was covered with black scales, as also the toes;
but in these the scales were larger.</P> 
<P> "These birds usually keep in the mountains, where they
find their prey: they never descend to the sea-shore, but in the rainy
season; for as they are very sensible of cold, they go there for
greater warmth. Though these moun∣tains are situated in the torrid zone,
the cold is often very severe; for a great part of the year they are covered
with snow, but parti∣cularly in winter.</P> 
<P> "The little nourishment which these birds find on the
sea-coast, except when the tempest drives in some great fish, obliges
the condor <PB N="105" REF="125"/> to continue there but a short time. They
usually come to the coast at the approach of evening; stay there all
night, and fly back in the morning."</P> </Q></P>
<P>It is doubted whether this animal be proper to America only, or
whether it may not have been described by the naturalists of other
coun∣tries. It is supposed, that the great bird called the Rock,
described by Arabian writers, and so much exaggerated by fable, is but a
species of the condor. The great bird of Tarnassar, in the East Indies,
that is larger than the eagle, as well as the vulture of Senegal, that carries
off children, are probably no other than the bird we have been describing.
Russia, Lapland, and even Switzerland and Germany, are said to have known
this animal. A bird of this kind was shot in France, that weighed eighteen
pound, and was said to be eighteen feet across the wings: however, one of
the quills was de∣scribed only as being larger than that of a swan; so
that probably the breadth of the wings may have been exaggerated, since a
bird so large would have the quills more than twice as big as those of a
swan. However this be, we are not to regret that it is scarcely ever seen
in Europe, as it appears to be one of the most formidable enemies of mankind.
In the deserts of Pa∣chomac, <PB N="106" REF="126"/> where it is chiefly
seen, men seldom venture to travel. Those wild regions are very
sufficient of themselves to inspire a secret horror: broken
precipices—prowling panthers—forests only vocal with the
hissing of serpents—and mountains rendered still more terrible by
the condor, the only bird that ventures to make its residence in those
deserted situations.</P>

</FIGURE></P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="128"/> THE first rank in the description of
birds, has been given to the eagle; not because it is stronger or larger
than the vulture, but because it is more generous and bold. The eagle,
unless pressed by famine, will not stoop to carrion; and never devours
but what he has earned by his own pursuit. The vulture, on the con∣trary, is
indelicately voracious; and seldom attacks living animals, when it can be
sup∣plied with the dead. The eagle meets and singly opposes his enemy;
the vulture, if it expects resistance, calls in the aid of its kind, and
basely overpowers its prey by a cowardly combination. Putrefaction and
stench, instead of deterring, only serves to allure them. The vulture
seems among birds, what the jackall and hyaena are among quadrupedes, who
prey upon carcasses, and root up the dead.</P>
<P>Vultures may be easily distinguished from all those of
the eagle kind, by the nakedness of their heads and necks, which are without
fea∣thers, and only covered with a very slight down, or a few scattered
hairs. Their eyes are more <PB REF="129"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/> <PB N="107" REF="130"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/> <PB N="108" REF="131"/>
prominent; those of the eagle being buried more in the socket. Their claws
are shorter, and less hooked. The inside of the wing is covered with a
thick down, which is different in them from all other birds of prey. Their
at∣titude is not so upright as that of the eagle; and their flight more
difficult and heavy.</P>
<P>In this tribe we may range the golden, the ash-coloured, and
the brown vulture, which are inhabitants of Europe; the spotted, and the
black vulture of Egypt; the bearded vulture; the Brasilian vulture, and the
king of the vul∣tures of South America. They all agree in their nature; being
equally indolent, yet rapacious and unclean.</P>
<P>The Golden Vulture seems to be the fore∣most of the kind;
and is in many things like the golden eagle, but larger in every proportion.
From the end of the beak, to that of the tail, it is four feet and an half; and
to the claws end, forty-five inches. The length of the upper mandible is
almost seven inches; and the tail twenty-seven in length. The lower part
of the neck, breast and belly, are of a red colour; but on the tail it is
more faint, and deeper near the head. The feathers are black on the back; and
on the wings and tail, of a yellowish brown. Others of the kind differ from
this in colour and <PB N="109" REF="132"/> dimensions; but they are all
stronly marked by their naked heads, and beak straight in the be∣ginning,
but hooking at the point.</P>
<P>They are still more strongly marked by their nature, which,
as has been observed, is cruel, unclean, and indolent. Their sense of
smelling, however, is amazingly great; and Nature, for this purpose, has
given them two large apertures or nostrils without, and an extensive
olfactory membrane within. Their intestines are formed differently from
those of the eagle kind; for they partake more of the formation of such
birds as live upon grain. They have both a crop and a stomach; which may be
regarded as a kind of gizzard, from the extreme thick∣ness of the muscles
of which it is composed. In fact, they seem adapted inwardly, not only for
being carnivorous, but to eat corn, or whatsoever of that kind comes in their
way.</P>
<P>This bird, which is common in many parts of Europe, and but too
well known on the western continent, is totally unknown in Eng∣land. In
Egypt, Arabia, and many other king∣doms of Africa and Asia, vultures are
found in great abundance. The inside down of their wing is converted into a
very warm and com∣fortable kind of fur, and is commonly sold in the Asiatic
markets.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="133"/>Indeed, in Egypt, this bird seems to be
of singular service. There are great flocks of them in the neighbourhood of
Grand Cairo, which no person is permitted to destroy. The service they
render the inhabitants, is the de∣vouring all the carrion and filth of that
great city; which might otherwise tend to corrupt and putrify the air. They
are commonly seen in company with the wild dogs of the country, tearing a
carcass very deliberately together. This odd association produces no
quarrels; the birds and quadrupedes seem to live amicably, and nothing but
harmony subsists between them. The wonder is still the greater, as both
are extremely rapacious, and both lean and bony to a very great degree;
probably having no great plenty even of the wretched food on which they
subsist.</P>
<P>In America, they lead a life somewhat similar. Wherever the
hunters, who there only pursue beasts for the skins, are found to go,
these birds are seen to pursue them. They still keep hovering at a
little distance; and when they see the beast flead and abandoned, they
call out to each other, pour down upon the carcass, and, in an instant,
pick its bones as bare and clean as if they had been scraped by a knife.</P>
<P>At the Cape of Good Hope, in Africa, they <PB N="111" REF="134"/>
seem to discover a still greater share of dexterity in their methods of
carving. 
<Q REND="inline">"I have," says Kolben, "been often a
spectator of the man∣ner in which they have anatomized a dead body: I say
anatomized, for no artist in the world could have done it more cleanly. They
have a wonderful method of separating the flesh from the bones, and yet
leaving the skin quite entire. Upon coming near the carcass, one would not
suppose it thus deprived of its internal substance, till he began to
examine it more closely; he then finds it, literally speaking, nothing but
skin and bone. Their manner of performing the operation, is this: they
first make an opening in the belly of the animal, from whence they pluck out
and greedily devour the entrails; then entering into the hollow which they have
made, they separate the flesh from the bones, without ever touching the
skin. It often happens that an ox returning home alone to its stall from
the plow, lies down by the way: it is then, if the vultures perceive it, that
they fall with fury down, and inevitably devour the unfortunate animal. They
sometimes attempt them grazing in the fields; and then, to the number of a
hundred, or more, make their attack all at once and together."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="135"/> 
<Q REND="inline">"They are attracted by carrion," says
Catesby, "from a very great distance. It is pleasant to behold them, when
they are thus eating, and disputing for their prey. An eagle generally
presides at these enter∣tainments, and makes them all keep their distance
till he has done. They then fall too with an excellent appetite: and their
sense of smelling is so exquisite, that the instant a carcass
drops, we may see the vultures floating in the air from all quarters, and
come sousing on their prey."</Q> It is supposed by some, that they
eat nothing that has life; but this is only when they are not able: for when
they can come at lambs, they shew no mercy; and serpents are their ordinary
food. The manner of those birds is to perch them∣selves, several
together, on the old pine and cypress-trees; where they continue all the
morning, for several hours, with their wings unfolded: nor are they fearful
of danger, but suffer people to approach them very near, par∣ticularly when
they are eating.</P>
<P>The sloth, the filth, and the voraciousness of these
birds, almost exceed credibility. In the Brazils, where they are found in
great abun∣dance, when they light upon a carcass, which they have liberty to
tear at their ease, they so <PB N="113" REF="136"/> gorge themselves, that
they are unable to fly; but keep hopping along when they are pursued. At all
times, they are a bird of slow flight, and unable readily to raise
themselves from the ground; but when they have over-fed, they are then
utterly helpless: but they soon get rid of their burthen; for they have a
me∣thod of vomiting up what they have eaten, and then they fly off with greater
facility.</P>
<P>It is pleasant, however, to be a spectator of the
hostilities between animals that are thus hateful or noxious. Of all
creatures, the two most at enmity, is the vulture of Brazil, and the
crocodile. The female of this terrible am∣phibious creature, which in the
rivers of that part of the world grows to the size of twenty-seven feet,
lays it eggs, to the number of one or two hundred, in the sands, on the
side of the river, where they are hatched by the heat of the climate. For
this purpose, she takes every precaution to hide from all other animals the
place where she deposes her burthen: in the mean time, a number of
vultures, or galinassos, as the Spaniards call them, sit, silent and
un∣seen, in the branches of some neighbouring forest, and view the
crocodile's operations, with the pleasing expectations of succeeding
plunder. They patiently wait till the crocodile <PB N="114" REF="137"/> has laid
the whole number of her eggs, till she has covered them carefully under the
sand, and until she is retired from them to a convenient distance. Then,
all together, encouraging each other with cries, they pour down upon the
nest, hook up the sand in a moment, lay the eggs bare, and devour the whole
brood without remorse. Wretched as is the flesh of these animals, yet
men, perhaps when pressed by hunger, have been tempted to taste it.
No∣thing can be more lean, stringy, nauseous, and unsavory. It is in vain
that, when killed, the rump has been cut off; in vain the body has been
washed, and spices used to overpower its prevailing odour; it still
smells and tastes of the carrion by which it was nourished, and sends
forth a stench that is insupportable.</P>
<P>These birds, at least those of Europe, usually lay two
eggs at a time, and produce but once a year. They make their nests in
inaccessible cliffs, and in places so remote that it is rare to find
them. Those in our part of the world, chiefly reside in the places where
they breed, and seldom come down into the plains, except when the snow and
ice, in their native retreats, has banished all living animals but
themselves: they then come from their heights, and brave the perils they
must encounter in a more cultivated <PB N="115" REF="138"/> region. As carrion
is not found, at those seasons, in sufficient quantity, or
sufficiently remote from man to sustain them, they prey upon rabbits,
hares, serpents, and whatever small game they can overtake or
overpower.</P>
<P>Such are the manners of this bird in general; but there is one
of the kind, called the King of the Vultures, which, from its extraordinary
figure, deserves a separate description. This bird is a native of
America, and not of the East Indies, as those who make a trade of shewing
birds would induce us to believe. This bird is larger than a turkey-cock; but
is cheifly remarkable for the odd formation of the skin of the head and neck,
which is bare. This skin arises from the base of the bill, and is of an
orange colour; from whence it stretches on each side to the head: from
thence it pro∣ceeds, like an indented comb, and falls on either side,
according to the motion of the head. The eyes are surrounded by a red skin,
of a scarlet colour; and the iris has the colour and lustre of pearl. The
head and neck are without feathers, covered with a flesh-coloured skin on
the upper part, a fine scarlet behind the head, and a duskier coloured
skin before: farther down behind the head, arises a little tuft of black
down, from whence issues and extends beneath <PB N="116" REF="139"/> the
throat, on each side, a wrinkled skin, of a brownish colour, mixed with
blue, and red∣dish behind: below, upon the naked part of the neck, is a
collar, formed by soft longish feathers, of a deep ash colour, which
surround the neck, and cover the breast before. Into this collar the bird
sometimes withdraws its whole neck, and sometimes a part of its head; so
that it looks as if it had withdrawn the neck into the body. Those marks are
sufficient to distinguish this bird from all others of the vulture kind;
and it cannot be doubted, but that it is the most beautiful of all this
deformed family: however, neither its habits nor instincts vary from the
rest of the tribe; being, like them, a slow cowardly bird, living chiefly
upon rats, lizards, and serpents; and upon carrion or excrement, when it
happens in the way. The flesh is so bad, that even savages themselves
cannot abide it.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XII. Of the Falcon Kind and its Affinities.</HEAD>
<P>EVERY creature becomes more important in the history of nature
in proportion as it is con∣nected with man. In this view, the smallest
ve∣getable, or the most seemingly contemptible insect, is a subject
more deserving attention than the most flourishing tree or the most
beau∣tiful of the feathered creation. In this view, the falcon is a more
important animal than the eagle or the vulture; and, though so very
di∣minutive in the comparison, is notwithstanding, from its connexion with
our pleasures, a much more interesting object of curiosity.</P>
<P>The amusement of hawking, indeed, is now pretty much given
over in this kingdom; for, as every country refines, as its enclosures become
higher and closer, those rural sports must conse∣quently decline, in
which the game is to be pursued over a long extent of country, and where,
while every thing retards the pursuer below, nothing can stop the object of
his pur∣suit above.</P>
<P>Falconry, that is now so much disused among us, was the
principal amusement of our <PB N="118" REF="141"/> ancestors. A person of
rank scarce stirred out without his hawk on his hand; which in old
paintings is the criterion of nobility. Harold, afterwards king of England,
when he went on a most important embassy into Normandy, is drawn in an
old bas-relief, as embarking with a bird on his fist and a dog under his arm.
In those days, it was thought sufficient for noble∣men's sons to wind the
horn, and to carry their hawk fair, and leave study and learning to the
children of meaner people. Indeed, this diversion was in such high esteem
among the great all over Europe, that Frederic, one of the em∣perors of
Germany, thought it not beneath him to write a treatise upon hawking.</P>
<P>The expence which attended this sport was very great: among
the old Welch princes, the king's falconer was the fourth officer in the
state; but, notwithstanding all his honours, he was forbid to take more
than three draughts of beer from his horn, lest he should get drunk and
neglect his duty. In the reign of James the First, Sir Thomas Monson is
said to have given a thousand pounds for a cast of hawks; and such was
their value in general, that it was made felony in the reign of Edward the
Third to steal a hawk. To take its eggs, even in a person's own ground, was
punishable with im∣prisonment <PB N="119" REF="142"/> for a year and a day,
together with a fine at the king's pleasure. In the reign of Elizabeth, the
imprisonment was reduced to three months; but the offender was to lie in
prison till he got security for his good behaviour for seven years
farther. In the earlier times, the art of gunning was but little practised,
and the hawk then was valuable, not only for its affording diversion, but for
its procuring de∣licacies for the table that could seldom be ob∣tained any
other way.</P>
<P>Of many of the ancient falcons used for this purpose, we at
this time know only the names, as the exact species are so ill described,
that one may be very easily mistaken for another. Of those in use at
present, both here and in other countries, are the gyr-falcon, the falcon,
the lanner, the sacre, the hobby, the kestril, and the merlin. These are
called the long∣winged hawks, to distinguish them from the goss-hawk, the
sparrow hawk, the kite, and the buzzard, that are of shorter wing, and
either too slow, too cowardly, too indolent, or too obstinate, to be
serviceable in contributing to the pleasures of the field.</P>
<P>The generous tribe of hawks, as was said, are
distinguished from the rest by the peculiar length of their wings, which
reach nearly as low <PB N="120" REF="143"/> as the tail. In these, the first
quill of the wing is nearly as long as the second; it terminates in a point
which begins to diminish from about an inch of its extremity. This
sufficiently distin∣guishes the generous breed from that of the baser
race of kites, sparrow-hawks, and buz∣zards, in whom the tail is longer than
the wings, and the first feather of the wing is rounded at the extremity.
They differ also in the latter having the fourth feather of the wing the
longest; in the generous race it is al∣ways the second.</P>
<P>This generous race, which have been taken into the service of
man, are endowed with na∣tural powers that the other kinds are not
pos∣sessed of. From the length of their wings, they are swifter to
pursue their game; from a confidence in this swiftness, they are bolder
to attack it; and, from an innate generosity, they have an attachment to
their feeder, and conse∣quently a docility which the baser birds are
strangers to.</P>
<P>The gyr-falcon leads in this bold train. He exceeds all other
falcons in the largeness of his size, for he approaches nearly to the
mag∣nitude of the eagle. The top of the head is flat and of an ash colour,
with a strong, thick, short, and blue beak. The feathers of the back 
<PB N="121" REF="144"/> and wings are marked with black spots, in the shape
of an heart; he is a courageous and fierce bird, nor fears even the eagle
himself; but he chiefly flies at the stork, the heron, and the crane. He is
mostly found in the colder re∣gions of the north, but loses neither his
strength nor his courage when brought into the milder climates.</P>
<P>The falcon, properly so called, is the second in magnitude
and fame. There are some va∣rieties in this bird; but there seem to be only
two that claim distinction; the falcon gentil and the peregrine faulcon; both
are much less than the gyr, and somewhat about the size of a raven. They
differ but slightly, and perhaps only from the different states they were
in when brought into captivity. Those differences are easier known by
experience than taught by de∣scription. The falcon gentil moults in March,
and often sooner; the peregrine falcon does not moult till the middle of
August. The pe∣regrine is stronger in the shoulder, has a larger eye, and
yet more sunk in the head; his beak is stronger, his legs longer, and the
toes better divided.</P>
<P>Next in size to these is the lanner, a bird now very little
known in Europe; then follows the sacre, the legs of which are of a 
<PB N="122" REF="145"/> bluish colour, and serve to distinguish that
bird; to them succeeds the hobby, used for smaller game, for daring
larks, and stooping at quails. The kestril was trained for the same
purposes; and lastly the merlin; which though the smallest of all the
hawk or falcon kind, and not much larger than a thrush, yet displays a
degree of courage that renders him formidable even to birds ten times his
size. He has often been known to kill a partridge or a quail at a single
pounce from above.</P>
<P>Some of the other species of sluggish birds were now and
then trained to this sport, but it was when no better could be obtained; but
these just described were only considered as birds of the nobler races.
Their courage in general was such, that no bird, not very much above their
own size, could terrify them; their swiftness so great, that scarce
any bird could escape them; and their docility so remarkable, that they
obeyed not only the commands, but the signs of their master. They remained
quietly perched upon his hand till their game was flushed, or else kept
hovering round his head, without ever leaving him but when he gave
permission. The common falcon is a bird of such spirit, that, like a
conqueror in a country, he keeps all birds in awe and in sub∣jection 
<PB N="123" REF="146"/> to his prowse. Where he is seen flying wild, as I
often had an opportunity of observ∣ing, the birds of every kind, that
seemed en∣tirely to disregard the kite or the sparrow-hawk, fly with
screams at his most distant appearance. Long before I could see the
falcon, I have seen them with the utmost signs of terror en∣deavouring to
avoid him; and, like the pea∣sants of a country before a victorious army,
every one of them attempting to shift for him∣self. Even the young falcons,
though their spirit be depressed by captivity, will, when brought out
into the field, venture to fly at barnacles and wild geese, till, being
soundly brushed and beaten by those strong birds, they learn their
error, and desist from meddling with such unwieldy game for the
future.</P>
<P>To train up the hawk to this kind of obe∣dience, so as to hunt
for his master, and bring him the game he shall kill, requires no small
degree of skill and assiduity. Numberless trea∣tises have been
written upon this subject, which are now, with the sport itself, almost
utterly for∣gotten: indeed, except to a few, they seem utterly
unintelligible; for the falconers had a language peculiar to themselves, in
which they conversed and wrote, and took a kind of professional pride in
using no other. A modern reader, I suppose, would be little edified by
one of the <PB N="124" REF="147"/> instructions, for instance, which we find
in Willoughby, when he bids us 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>draw our falcon out of the mew twenty days
before we enseam her. If she truss and carry, the remedy is, to cosse
her talons, her powse, and petty single.</HI></Q></P>
<P>But, as it certainly makes a part of natural history to shew
how much the nature of birds can be wrought upon by harsh or kind treat∣ment,
I will just take leave to give a short ac∣count of the manner of training
an hawk, di∣vested of those cant words with which men of art have thought
proper to obscure their pro∣fession.</P>
<P>In order to train up a falcon, the master begins by clapping
on straps upon his legs, which are called jesses, to which there is
fastened a ring with the owner's name, by which, in case he should be
lost, the finder may know where to bring him back. To these also are
added little bells, which serve to mark the place where he is, if lost in
the chace. He is always carried on the fist, and is obliged to keep without
sleeping. If he be stubborn, and attempts to bite, his head is plunged into
water. Thus, by hunger, watch∣ing, and fatigue, he is constrained to submit
to having his head covered by a hood or cowl, which covers his eyes. This
troublesome em∣ployment continues often for three days and 
<PB N="125" REF="148"/> nights without ceasing. It rarely happens but at the
end of this his necessities, and the pri∣vation of light, make him lose
all idea of li∣berty, and bring down his natural wildness. His master
judges of his being tamed when he permits his head to be covered without
resist∣ance, and when uncovered he seizes the meat before him
contentedly. The repetition of these lessons by degrees ensures
success. His wants being the chief principle of his depend∣ance, it is
endeavoured to encrease his appetite by giving him little balls of flannel,
which he greedily swallows. Having thus excited the appetite, care is taken
to satisfy it; and thus gratitude attaches the bird to the man who but just
before had been his tormentor.</P>
<P>When the first lessons have succeeded, and the bird
shews signs of docility, he is carried out upon some green, the head is
uncovered, and, by flattering him with food at different times, he is taught to
jump on the fist, and to continue there. When confirmed in this habit, it is
then thought time to make him acquainted with the lure. This lure is only a
thing stuffed like the bird the falcon is designed to pursue, such as
an heron, a pidgeon, or a quail, and on this lure they always take care to give
him his food. It is quite necessary that the bird should 
<PB N="126" REF="149"/> not only be acquainted with this but fond of it, and
delicate in his food when shewn it. When the falcon has flown upon this, and
tasted the first morsel, some falconers then take it away; but by this
there is a danger of daunting the bird; and the surest method is, when he
flies to seize it to let him feed at large, and this serves as a recompence
for his docility. The use of this lure is to flatter him back when he has
flown in the air, which it sometimes fails to do; and it is always
requisite to assist it by the voice and the signs of the master.
When these lessons have been long repeated, it is then necessary to
study the character of the bird; to speak fre∣quently to him if he be
inattentive to the voice; to stint in his food such as do not come kindly
or readily to the lure; to keep waking him if he be not sufficiently
familiar; and to cover him frequently with the hood if he fears darkness.
When the familiarity and the docility of the bird are sufficiently confirmed
on the green, he is then carried into the open fields, but still kept fast
by a string which is about twenty yards long. He is then uncovered as before;
and the falconer, calling him at some paces distance, shews him the lure.
When he flies upon it he is permitted to take a large morsel of the food
which is tied to it. The next day the lure is shewn him at 
<PB N="127" REF="150"/> a greater distance, till he comes at last to fly to
it at the utmost length of his string. He is then to be shewn the game
itself alive, but dis∣abled or tame, which he is designed to pursue.
After having seized this several times with his string, he is then left
entirely at liberty, and carried into the field for the purposes of
pur∣suing that which is wild. At that he flies with avidity; and when he has
seized it, or killed it, he is brought back by the voice and the lure.</P>
<P>By this method of instruction, an hawk may be taught to fly at
any game whatsoever; but falconers have chiefly confined their pursuit only
to such animals as yield them profit by the capture or pleasure in the
pursuit. The hare, the partridge, and the quail, repay the trouble of taking
them; but the most delightful sport is the falcon's pursuit of the heron,
the kite, or the wood-lark. Instead of flying di∣rectly forward, as some
other birds do, these, when they see themselves threatened by the
ap∣proach of the hawk, immediately take to the skies. They fly almost
perpendicularly up∣ward, while their ardent pursuer keeps pace with their
flight, and tries to rise above them. Thus both diminish by degrees from
the gazing spectator below, till they are quite lost in the clouds; but
they are soon seen descending, <PB N="128" REF="151"/> struggling
together, and using every effort on both sides; the one of rapacious
insult, the other of desperate defence. The unequal combat is soon at an
end; the falcon comes off victorious, and the other, killed or disabled, is
made a prey either to the bird or the sportsman.</P>
<P>As for other birds, they are not so much pur∣sued, as they
generally fly straight forward, by which the sportsman loses sight of
the chace, and, what is still worse, runs a chance of losing his falcon
also. The pursuit of the lark by a couple of merlins is considered, to
him only who regards the sagacity of the chace, as one of the most
delightful spectacles this exercise can afford. The amusement is, to
see one of the merlins climbing to get the ascendant of the lark, while the
other, lying low for the best advantage, waits the success of its
companion's efforts; thus while the one stoops to strike its prey, the
other seizes it at its coming down.</P>
<P>Such is the natural and acquired habits of these birds, which
of all others have the greatest strength and courage relative to their
size. While the kite or the goss-hawk approach their prey side-ways,
these dart perpendicularly, in their wild state, upon their game, and
devour it on the spot, or carry it off, if not too large for their power of
flying. They are sometimes <PB N="129" REF="152"/> seen descending
perpendicularly from the clouds, from an amazing height, and darting down on
their prey with inevitable swiftness and de∣struction.</P>
<P>The more ignoble race of birds make up by cunning and
assiduity what these claim by force and celerity. Being less
courageous, they are more patient; and, having less swiftness, they are
better skilled at taking their prey by sur∣prize. The kite, that may be
distinguished from all the rest of this tribe by his forky tail and his
slow floating motion, seems almost for∣ever upon the wing. He appears to
rest him∣self upon the bosom of the air, and not to make the smallest
effort in flying. He lives only upon accidental carnage, as almost every bird
in the air is able to make good its retreat against him. He may be therefore
considered as an insiduous thief who only prowls about and, when he finds a
small bird wounded, or a young chicken strayed too far from the mother,
instantly seizes the hour of calamity, and, like a famished glutton, is
sure to shew no mercy. His hunger, indeed, often urges him to acts of
seeming desperation. I have seen one of them fly round and round for a
while to mark a clutch of chickens, and then on a sudden dart like lightning
upon the unresisting little <PB N="130" REF="153"/> animal, and carry it
off, the hen in vain crying out, and the boys hooting and casting stones to
scare it from its plunder. For this reason, of all birds the kite is the
good housewife's greatest tormentor and aversion.</P>
<P>Of all obscene birds, the kite is the best known; but the
buzzard among us is the most plenty. He is a sluggish inactive bird, and
often remains perched whole days together upon the same bough. He is rather
an assassin than a pursuer; and lives more upon frogs, mice, and
insects, which he can easily seize, than upon birds which he is obliged
to follow. He lives in summer by robbing the nests of other birds, and
sucking their eggs, and more re∣sembles the owl kind in his countenance
than any other rapacious bird of day. His figure implies the stupidity of his
disposition; and so little is he capable of instruction from man, that
it is common to a proverb to call one who cannot be taught, or continues
obstinately ig∣norant, a buzzard. The honey-buzzard, the moor-buzzard, and
the hen-harrier, are all of this stupid tribe, and differ chiefly in their
size, growing less in the order I have named them. The goss-hawk and
sparrow hawk are what Mr. Willoughby calls short winged birds, and
con∣sequently unfit for training, however injurious <PB N="131" REF="154"/>
they may be to the pidgeon-house or the sports∣man. They have been indeed
taught to fly at game; but little is to be obtained from their efforts, being
difficult of instruction and capri∣cious in their obedience. It has been
lately as∣serted, however, by one whose authority is re∣spectable, that
the sparrow-hawk is the boldest and the best of all others for the
pleasure of the chace.</P>

<PB N="132" REF="155"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. XII. The Butcher-Bird.</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE I conclude this short history of ra∣pacious birds
that prey by day, I must take leave to describe a tribe of smaller birds,
that seem from their size rather to be classed with the harmless
order of the sparrow-kind; but that from their crooked beak, courage, and
appetites for slaughter, certainly deserve a place here. The lesser
butcher-bird is not much above the size of a lark; that of the smallest
species is not so big as a sparrow; yet, diminutive as these little
animals are, they make themselves for∣midable to birds of four times their
dimensions.</P>
<P>The greater butcher bird is about as large as a thrush; its
bill is black, an inch long, and hooked at the end. This mark, together with
its carnivorous appetites, ranks it among the rapacious birds; at the same
time that its legs and feet, which are slender, and its toes, formed
somewhat differently from the former, would seem to make it the shade
between such birds as live wholly upon flesh, and such as live chiefly
upon insects and grain.</P>
<P>Indeed, its habits seem entirely to correspond 
<PB N="133" REF="156"/> with its conformation, as it is found to live as well
upon flesh as upon insects, and thus to partake in some measure of a
double nature. However, its appetite for flesh is the most pre∣valent; and
it never takes up with the former when it can obtain the latter. This bird,
there∣fore, leads a life of continual combat and op∣position. As from its
size it does not much terrify the smaller birds of the forest, so it
very frequently meets birds willing to try its strength, and it never
declines the engagement.</P>
<P>It is wonderful to see with what intrepidity this little
creature goes to war with the pie, the crow, and the kestril, all above four
times bigger than itself, and that sometimes prey upon flesh in the
same manner. It not only fights upon the defensive, but often comes to the
attack, and always with advantage, particularly when the male and female unite
to protect their young, and to drive away the more powerful birds of rapine. At
that season, they do not wait the approach of their invader; it is
suf∣ficient that they see him preparing for the as∣sault at a
distance. It is then that they sally forth with loud cries, wound him on
every side, and drive him off with such fury, that he seldom ventures to
return to the charge. In these kinds of disputes, they generally come off
with <PB N="134" REF="157"/> the victory; though it sometimes happens that
they fall to the ground with the bird they have so fiercely fixed upon, and
the combat ends with the destruction of the assailant as well as the
defender.</P>
<P>For this reason, the most redoubtable birds of prey
respect them; while the kite, the buz∣zard, and the crow, seems rather to
fear than seek the engagement. Nothing in nature better displays the
respect paid to the claims of cou∣rage, than to see this little bird,
apparently so contemptible, fly in company with the lanner, the falcon, and
all the tyrants of the air, with∣out fearing their power, or avoiding their
re∣sentment.</P>
<P>As for small birds, they are its usual food. It seizes
them by the throat, and strangles them in an instant. When it has thus
killed the bird or insect, it is asserted by the best authority, that
it fixes them upon some neighbouring thorn, and, when thus spitted, pulls
them to pieces with its bill. It is supposed that as Na∣ture has not given
this bird strength sufficient to tear its prey to pieces with its feet, as
the hawks do, it is obliged to have recourse to this extraordinary
expedient.</P>
<P>During summer, such of them as constantly reside here,
for the smaller red butcher-bird migrates, remain among the mountainous parts
<PB N="135" REF="158"/> of the country; but in winter they descend into the
plains and nearer human habitations. The larger kind make their nests on the
highest trees, while the lesser build in bushes in the fields and
hedge-rows. They both lay about six eggs, of a white colour, but encircled at
the bigger end with a ring of brownish red. The nest on the outside is
composed of white moss, interwoven with long grass; within, it is well
lined with wool, and is usually fixed among the forking branches of a tree.
The female feeds her young with caterpillars and other insects while very
young; but soon after accustoms them to flesh, which the male procures
with surprizing industry. Their nature also is very different from other
birds of prey in their parental care; for, so far from driving out their
young from the nest to shift for themselves, they keep them with care;
and even when adult they do not forsake them, but the whole brood live in one
family together. Each family lives apart, and is generally com∣posed of the
male, female, and five or six young ones; these all maintain peace and
subordina∣tion among each other, and hunt in concert. Upon the returning
season of courtship this union is at an end, the family parts for ever,
each to establish a little household of its own. It is easy to
distinguish these birds at a distance, <PB N="136" REF="159"/> not only
from their going in companies, but also from their manner of flying, which is
always up and down, seldom direct or side-ways.</P>
<P>Of these birds there are three or four different kinds; but
the greater ash-coloured butcher-bird is the least known among us. The red
backed butcher-bird migrates in autumn, and does not return till spring. The
woodchat re∣sembles the former except in the colour of the back, which is
brown and not red as in the other. There is still another, less than either
of the former, found in the marshes near London. This too is a bird of prey,
although not much bigger than a tit-mouse; an evident proof that an animal's
courage or rapacity does not depend upon its size. Of foreign birds of this
kind there are several; but as we know little of their manner of living, we
will not, instead of hi∣story, substitute mere description. In fact,
the colours of a bird, which is all we know of them, would afford a reader but
small entertainment in the enumeration. Nothing can be more easy than to
fill volumes with the different shades of a bird's plumage; but these
accounts are written with more pleasure than they are read; and a single
glance of a good plate or a picture imprints a juster idea than a volume
could convey.</P>

<PB N="137" REF="160"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. XIII. Of Rapacious Birds of the Owl Kind that prey by
Night.</HEAD>
<P>HITHERTO we have been describing a tribe of animals who,
though plunderers among their fellows of the air, yet wage war boldly in the
face of day. We now come to a race equally cruel and rapacious; but who add to
their savage disposition, the further reproach of treachery, and carry on
all their depredations by night.</P>
<P>All birds of the owl kind may be considered as nocturnal
robbers, who, unfitted for taking their prey while it is light, surprize it
at those hours of rest when the tribes of Nature are in the least
expectation of an enemy. Thus there seems no link in Nature's chain broken;
no where a dead inactive repose; but every place, every season, every
hour of the day and night, is bustling with life, and furnishing
instances of industry, self-defence, and invasion.</P>
<P>All birds of the owl kind have one common mark, by which they
are distinguished from others; their eyes are formed for seeing better in
the dusk, than in the broad glare of sun-shine. As in the eyes of tigers
and cats, that are formed <PB N="138" REF="161"/> for a life of nocturnal
depredation, there is a quality in the retina that takes in the rays of light
so copiously as to permit their seeing in places almost quite dark;
so in these birds there is the same conformation of that organ, and
though, like us, they cannot see in a total ex∣clusion of light, yet they
are sufficiently quick-sighted, at times when we remain in total
ob∣scurity. In the eyes of all animals Nature hath made a complete
provision, either to shut out too much light, or to admit a sufficiency,
by the contraction and dilatation of the pupil. In these birds the pupil is
capable of opening very wide, or shutting very close: by contracting the
pupil, the brighter light of the day, which would act too powerfully upon the
sensibility of the retina, is excluded; by dilating the pupil, the animal
takes in the more faint rays of the night, and thereby is enabled to spy its
prey, and catch it with greater facility in the dark. Beside this, there is
an irradiation on the back of the eye, and the very iris itself has a faculty
of reflecting the rays of light, so as to assist vision in the gloomy
places where these birds are found to frequent.</P>
<P>But though owls are dazzled by too bright a day-light, yet they
do not see best in the darkest nights, as some have been apt to
imagine. It is in the dusk of the evening, or the grey of 
<PB N="139" REF="162"/> the morning, that they are best fitted for seeing;
at those seasons when there is neither too much light, nor too little. It
is then that they issue from their retreats, to hunt or to surprize their
prey, which is usually attended with great success: it is then that they
find all other birds asleep, or preparing for repose, and they have only to
seize the most unguarded.</P>
<P>The nights when the moon shines are the times of their most
successful plunder; for when it is wholly dark, they are less qualified
for seeing and pursuing their prey: except, there∣fore, by moonlight, they
contract the hours of their chace; and if they come out at the ap∣proach of
dusk in the evening, they return before it is totally dark, and then rise
by twi∣light the next morning to pursue their game, and to return, in like
manner, before the broad day-light begins to dazzle them with its
splendor.</P>
<P>Yet the faculty of seeing in the night, or of being entirely
dazzled by day, is not alike in every species of these nocturnal birds:
some see by night better than others; and some are so little dazzled by
day-light, that they perceive their enemies and avoid them. The common White or
Barn Owl, for instance, sees with such exquisite acuteness in the
dark, that though the barn has been shut at night, and the light 
<PB N="140" REF="163"/> thus totally excluded, yet it perceives the smallest
mouse that peeps from its hole: on the con∣trary, the Brown Horn Owl is often
seen to prowl along the hedges by day, like the sparrow-hawk; and
sometimes with good success.</P>
<P>All birds of the owl kind may be divided into two sorts;
those that have horns, and those without. These horns are nothing more
than two or three feathers that stand up on each side of the head over the
ear, and give this animal a kind of horned appearance. Of the horned kind is,
the Great Horned Owl, which at first view appears as large as an eagle. When
he comes to be observed more closely, however, he will be found much
less. His legs, body, wings and tail, are shorter; his head much larger and
thicker: his horns are composed of feathers, that rise above two inches and
an half high, and which he can erect or depress at pleasure: his eyes are
large and transparent, encircled with an orange-coloured iris: his ears are
large and deep, and it would appear that no animal was possessed with a
more exquisite sense of hearing: his plumage is of a reddish brown,
marked on the back with black and yellow spots, and yellow only upon the
belly.</P>
<P>Next to this is the Common Horned Owl, of a much smaller
size than the former, and with <PB N="141" REF="164"/> horns much shorter.
As the great owl was five feet from the tip of one wing to the other, this is
but three. The horns are but about an inch long, and consist of six
feathers, variegated with black and yellow.</P>
<P>There is still a smaller kind of the horned owl, which is
not much larger than a black-bird; and whose horns are remarkably short,
being composed but of one feather, and that not above half an inch high.</P>
<P>To these succeeds the tribe without horns. The Howlet, which
is the largest of this kind, with dusky plumes, and black eyes; the Screech
Owl, of a smaller size, with blue eyes, and plumage of an iron grey; the
White Owl, about as large as the former, with yellow eyes and whitish
plumage; the Great Brown Owl, less than the former, with brown plumage and a
brown beak; and lastly, the Little Brown Owl, with yellowish coloured eyes,
and an orange-coloured bill. To this catalogue might be added others of foreign
denominations, which differ but little from our own, if we except the Harfang,
or Great Hudson's Bay Owl of Ed∣wards, which is the largest of all the
nocturnal tribe, and as white as the snows of the country of which he is a
native.</P>
<P>All this tribe of animals, however they may differ in their
size and plumage, agree in their <PB N="142" REF="165"/> general
characteristics of preying by night, and having their eyes formed for
nocturnal vision. Their bodies are strong and muscular; their feet and
claws made for tearing their prey; and their stomachs for digesting it. It
must be remarked, however, that the digestion of all birds that live upon
mice, lizards, or such like food, is not very perfect; for though they
swallow them whole, yet they are always seen some time after to
disgorge the skin and bones, rolled up in a pellet, as being
in∣digestible.</P>
<P>In proportion as each of these animals bears the day-light
best, he sets forward earlier in the evening in pursuit of his prey. The
great horned owl is the foremost in leaving his retreat; and ventures into
the woods and thickets very soon in the evening. The horned, and the brown
owl, are later in their excursions: but the barn owl seems to see best
in profound dark∣ness; and seldom leaves his hiding-place till
midnight.</P>
<P>As they are incapable of supporting the light of the day, or
at least of then seeing and readily avoiding their danger, they keep all
this time concealed in some obscure retreat, suited to their gloomy
appetites, and there continue in solitude and silence. The cavern of a
rock, the darkest part of an hollow tree, the battle∣ments 
<PB N="143" REF="166"/> of a ruined and unfrequented castle, some obscure
hole in a farmer's out-house, are the places where they are usually found:
if they be seen out of these retreats in the day-time, they may be
considered as having lost their way; as having by some accident been
thrown into the midst of their enemies, and surrounded with danger.</P>
<P>Having spent the day in their retreat, at the approach of
evening they sally forth, and skim rapidly up and down along the hedges.
The barn-owl indeed, who lives chiefly upon mice, is contented to be more
stationary: he takes his residence upon some shock of corn, or the
point of some old house; and there watches in the dark, with the utmost
perspicacity and per∣severance.</P>
<P>Nor are these birds by any means silent; they all have an
hideous note; which, while pursuing their prey, is seldom heard; but may be
considered rather as a call to courtship. There is something always
terrifying in this call, which is often heard in the silence of mid∣night,
and breaks the general pause with an horrid variation. It is different in
all; but in each it is alarming and disagreeable. Father Kircher, who has
set the voices of birds to mu∣sic, has given all the tones of the owl note,
<PB N="144" REF="167"/> which makes a most tremendous melody. In∣deed, the
prejudices of mankind are united with their sensations to make the cry of
the owl disagreeable. The screech-owl's voice was al∣ways considered
among the people, as a presage of some sad calamity that was soon to
ensue.</P>
<P>They seldom, however, are heard while they are preying; that
important pursuit is always attended with silence, as it is by no means
their intention to disturb or forwarn those little ani∣mals they wish to
surprize. When their pursuit has been successful, they soon return to
their so∣litude, or to their young, if that be the season. If, however,
they find but little game, they con∣tinue their quest still longer; and it
sometimes happens that, obeying the dictates of appetite rather than of
prudence, they pursue so long that broad day breaks in upon them, and
leaves them dazzled, bewildered, and at a distance from home.</P>
<P>In this distress they are obliged to take shelter in the
first tree or hedge that offers, there to continue concealed all day, till
the returning darkness once more supplies them with a better plan of the
country. But it too often happens that, with all their precaution to conceal
themselves, they are spied out by the other birds of the place, and are
sure to receive <PB N="143" REF="168"/> no mercy. The black-bird, the
thrush, the jay, the bunting, and the red-breast, all come in file, and
employ their little arts of insult and abuse. The smallest, the
feeblest, and the most contemptible of this unfortunate bird's enemies, are
then the foremost to injure and torment him. They encrease their cries and
turbulence round him, flap him with their wings, and are ready to shew their
courage to be great, as they are sensible that their danger is but small.
The unfortunate owl, not knowing where to attack or where to fly, patiently
sits and suffers all their insults. Astonished and dizzy, he only
replies to their mockeries by aukward and ridiculous gestures, by turning his
head, and rolling his eyes with an air of stupidity. It is enough that an owl
appears by day to set the whole grove into a kind of uproar. Either the
aversion all the small birds have to this animal, or the
consciousness of their own security, makes them pursue him without
ceasing, while they encourage each other by their mutual cries to lend
assistance in this laudable undertaking.</P>
<P>It sometimes happens, however, that the little birds pursue
their insults with the same impru∣dent zeal with which the owl himself
had pur∣sued his depredations. They hunt him the whole day until evening
returns; which re∣storing <PB N="144" REF="169"/> him his faculties of sight
once more, he makes the foremost of his pursuers pay dear for their former
sport: nor is man always an uncon∣cerned spectator here. The bird-catchers
have got an art of counterfeiting the cry of the owl exactly; and, having
before limed the branches of an hedge, they sit unseen and give the call.
At this, all the little birds flock to the place where they expect to find
their well-known ene∣my; but instead of finding their stupid anta∣gonist
they are stuck fast to the hedge them∣selves. This sport must be put
in practice an hour before night-fall in order to be successful; for if it
is put off till later, those birds which but a few minutes sooner came to
provoke their enemy, will then fly from him with as much terror as they just
before shewed insolence.</P>
<P>It is not unpleasant to see one stupid bird made in some
sort a decoy to deceive another. The great horned owl is sometimes made
use of for this purpose, to lure the kite when fal∣coners desire to catch
him for the purposes of training the falcon. Upon this occasion they clap
the tail of a fox to the great owl to render his figure extraordinary; in which
trim he sails slowly along, flying low, which is his usual manner. The
kite, either curious to observe this odd kind of animal, or perhaps
inquisitive <PB N="145" REF="170"/> to see whether it may not be proper for
food, flies after, and comes nearer and nearer. In this manner he continues to
hover, and some∣times to descend, till the falconer setting a
strong-winged hawk against him, seizes him for the purpose of training
his young ones at home.</P>
<P>The usual place where the great horned owl breeds is in the
cavern of a rock, the hollow of a tree, or the turret of some ruined
castle. Its nest is near three feet in diameter, and com∣posed of
sticks, bound together by the fibrous roots of trees, and lined with leaves
on the in∣side. It lays about three eggs, which are larger than those of a
hen, and of a colour somewhat resembling the bird itself. The young ones
are very voracious, and the parents not less expert at satisfying the call
of hunger. The lesser owl of this kind never makes a nest for itself,
but always takes up with the old nest of some other bird, which it has
often been forced to abandon. It lays four or five eggs; and the young are all
white at first, but change colour in about a fortnight. The other owls in
general build near the place where they chiefly prey; that which feeds upon
birds in some neighbour∣ing grove, that which preys chiefly upon mice near
some farmer's yard, where the proprietor of the place takes care to give it
perfect secu∣rity. <PB N="146" REF="171"/> In fact, whatever mischief one
species of owl may do in the woods, the barn-owl makes a sufficient
recompense for, by being equally active in destroying mice nearer home;
so that a single owl is said to be more serviceable than half a dozen
cats, in ridding the barn of its domestic vermin. 
<Q REND="inline">"In the year 1580," says an old writer, "at
Hallontide, an army of mice so over-run the marshes near Southminster,
that they eat up the grass to the very roots. But at length a great number of
strange painted owls came and devoured all the mice. The like happened again
in Essex about sixty years after."</Q></P>
<P>To conclude our account of these birds, they are all very
shy of man, and extremely indocile and difficult to be tamed. The white owl
in particular, as Mr. Buffon asserts, cannot be made to live in captivity;
I suppose he means if it be taken when old. 
<Q REND="inline">"They live," says he, "ten or twelve days in
the aviary where they are shut up; but they refuse all kind of
nou∣rishment, and at last die of hunger. By day they remain without moving
upon the floor of the aviary; in the evening, they mount on the highest
perch, where they continue to make a noise like a man snoring with his
mouth open. This seems designed as a call <PB N="147" REF="172"/> for their
old companions without; and, in fact, I have seen several others come to
the call, and perch upon the roof of the aviary, where they made the same
kind of hissing, and soon after permitted themselves to be taken in a
net."</Q></P>

<HEAD>PART II. OF BIRDS OF THE POULTRY KIND.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="151" REF="174"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. I. Of Birds of the Poultry Kind.</HEAD>
<P>FROM the most rapacious and noxious tribe of birds, we make a
transition to those which of all others are the most harmless and the
most serviceable to man. He may force the rapacious tribes to assist
his pleasures in the field, or induce the smaller warblers to delight him
with their singing; but it is from the poultry kind that he derives the
most solid advantages, as they not only make a considerable addition to
the necessaries of life, but furnish out the greatest delicacies to
every entertainment.</P>
<P>Almost if not all the domestic birds of the poultry kind
that we maintain in our yards are of foreign extraction; but there are others
to be ranked in this class that are as yet in a state of nature; and
perhaps only wait till they be∣come sufficiently scarce to be taken under
the care of man to multiply their propagation. It will appear remarkable
enough, if we con∣sider how much the tame poultry which we have imported from
distant climates has en∣creased, and how much those wild birds of the
poultry kind that have never yet been taken <PB N="152" REF="175"/> into keeping
have been diminished and de∣stroyed. They are all thinned; and many of the
species, especially in the more cultivated and populous parts of the
kingdom, are utterly unseen.</P>
<P>Under birds of the poultry kind I rank all those that have
white flesh, and, comparatively to their head and limbs, have bulky bodies.
They are furnished with short strong bills for picking up grain, which is
their chief and often their only sustenance. Their wings are short and
concave; for which reason they are not able to fly far. They lay a great many
eggs; and, as they lead their young abroad the very day they are hatched, in
quest of food, which they are shewn by the mother, and which they pick up
for themselves, they generally make their nests on the ground. The toes of
all these are united by a membrane as far as the first articulation, and
then are divided as in those of the former class.</P>
<P>Under this class we may therefore rank the common cock, the
peacock, the turkey, the pintada or Guinea hen, the pheasant, the bu∣stard,
the grous, the partridge, and the quail. These all bear a strong
similitude to each other, being equally granivorous, fleshy, and delicate 
<PB N="153" REF="176"/> to the palate. These are among birds what beasts of
pasture are among quadrupedes, peaceable tenants of the field, and shunning
the thicker parts of the forest, that abounds with numerous animals who carry
on unceasing ho∣stilities against them.</P>
<P>As Nature has formed the rapacious class for war, so she
seems equally to have fitted these for peace, rest, and society. Their
wings are but short, so that they are ill formed for wan∣dering from one
region to another; their bills are also short, and incapable of annoying
their opposers; their legs are strong indeed; but their toes are made for
scratching up their food, and not for holding or tearing it. These are
sufficient indications of their harmless na∣ture; while their bodies, which
are fat and fleshy, render them unwieldy travellers, and incapable of
straying far from each other.</P>
<P>Accordingly we find them chiefly in society; they live
together; and though they may have their disputes, like all other animals,
upon some occasions; yet, when kept in the same district, or fed in the
same yard, they learn the arts of subordination; and, in proportion as each
knows his strength, he seldom tries a second time the combat where he has
once been worsted.</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="177"/>In this manner, all of this kind seem to
lead an indolent voluptuous life: as they are fur∣nished internally with a
very strong stomach, commonly called a gizzard, so their
voracious∣ness scarce knows any bounds. If kept in close captivity, and
separated from all their former companions, they still have the pleasure
of eat∣ing left; and they soon grow fat and unwieldy in their prison. To
say this more simply, many of the wilder species of birds, when cooped or
caged, pine away, grow gloomy, and some re∣fuse all sustenance
whatever; none except those of the poultry kind grow fat, who seem to
lose all remembrance of their former liberty, satisfied with indolence and
plenty.</P>
<P>The poultry kind may be considered as sensual epicures,
solely governed by their appetites. The indulgence of these seems to
influence their other habits, and destroys among them that con∣nubial
fidelity for which most other kinds are remarkable. The eagle and the falcon,
how fierce soever to other animals, are yet gentle and true to each other;
their connexions when once formed continue till death; and the male and female
in every exigence and every duty lend faithful assistance to each other.
They assist each other in the production of their young, in 
<PB N="155" REF="178"/> providing for them when produced; and even then, though
they drive them forth to fight their own battles, yet the old ones still
retain their former affection to each other, and seldom part far
asunder.</P>
<P>But it is very different with this luxurious class I am now
describing. Their courtship is but short, and their congress
fortuitous. The male takes no heed of his offspring; and sa∣tisfied with the
pleasure of getting, leaves to the female all the care of providing for
po∣sterity. Wild and irregular in his appetites, he ranges from one to
another; and claims every female which he is strong enough to keep from his
fellows. Though timorous when opposed to birds of prey, yet he is incredibly
bold among those of his own kind; and but to see a male of his own
species is sufficient to pro∣duce a combat. As his desires extend to all,
every creature becomes his enemy that pretends to be his rival.</P>
<P>The female, equally without fidelity or at∣tachment, yields to
the most powerful. She stands by, a quiet meretricious spectator of their
fury, ready to reward the conqueror with every compliance. She takes upon
herself all the labour of hatching and bringing up her <PB N="156" REF="179"/>
young, and chuses a place for hatching as re∣mote as possible from the
cock. Indeed, she gives herself very little trouble in making a nest, as
her young ones are to forsake it the instant they part from the
shell.</P>
<P>She is equally unassisted in providing for her young, that
are not fed with meat put into their mouths, as in other classes of the
feathered kind, but peck their food, and, forsaking their nests, run here
and there, following the parent wherever it is to be found. She leads them
forward where they are likely to have the greatest quan∣tity of grain, and
takes care to shew by pecking, the sort proper for them to seek for.
Though at other times voracious, she is then abstemious to an extreme
degree; and, intent only on pro∣viding for and shewing her young clutch their
food, she scarce takes any nourishment herself. Her parental pride
seems to overpower every other appetite; but that decreases in propor∣tion
as her young ones are more able to provide for themselves, and then all her
voracious habits return.</P>
<P>Among the other habits peculiar to this class of birds is that
of dusting themselves. They lie flat in some dusty place, and with
their wings and feet raise and scatter the dust over 
<PB N="157" REF="180"/> their whole body. What may be their reason for thus
doing it is not easy to explain. Per∣haps the heat of their bodies is such,
that they require this powder to be interposed between their feathers to keep
them from lying too close together, and thus encreasing that heat with
which they are incommoded.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="158" REF="181"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. II. Of the Cock.</HEAD>
<P>ALL birds taken under the protection of man lose a part of
their natural figure, and are al∣tered not only in their habits but their very
form. Climate, food, and captivity, are three very powerful agents in producing
these alte∣rations; and those birds that have longest felt their
influence under human direction, are the most likely to have the greatest
variety in their figures, their plumage, and their dispositions.</P>
<P>Of all other birds, the cock seems to be the oldest
companion of mankind, to have been first reclaimed from the forest, and
taken to supply the accidental failure of the luxuries or necessities of
life. As he is thus longest under the care of man, so of all others perhaps
he exhibits the greatest number of varieties, there being scarce two birds
of this species that ex∣actly resemble each other in plumage and form. The
tail, which makes such a beautiful figure in the generality of these birds,
is yet found en∣tirely wanting in others; and not only the tail but the rump
also. The toes, which are usually four in all animals of the poultry kind,
yet in <PB N="161" REF="182"/> a species of the cock are found to amount to
five. The feathers, which lie so sleek and in such beautiful order in
most of those we are ac∣quainted with, are in a peculiar breed all
in∣verted, and stand staring the wrong way. Nay, there is a species that
comes from Japan, which instead of feathers seems to be covered over with
hair. These and many other varieties are to be found in this animal, which
seem to be the marks this early prisoner bears of his long captivity.</P>
<P>It is not well ascertained when the cock was first made
domestic in Europe; but it is ge∣nerally agreed that we first had him in
our western world from the kingdom of Persia. Aristophanes calls the cock
the Persian bird, and tells us he enjoyed that kingdom before some of its
earliest monarchs. This animal was in fact known so early even in the
most savage parts of Europe, that we are told the cock was one of the
forbidden foods among the ancient Britons. Indeed, the domestic fowl seems
to have banished the wild one. Persia itself, that first introduced it
to our acquaintance, seems no longer to know it in its natural form; and if
we did not find it wild in some of the woods of India, as well as those of
the islands in the Indian Ocean, we might begin to doubt, as 
<PB N="158" REF="183"/> <GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/> 
<PB N="161" REF="184"/> <GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/> 
<PB N="162" REF="185"/> we do with regard to the sheep, in what form it
first existed in a state of nature.</P>
<P>But those doubts no longer exist: the cock is found in the
islands of Tinian, in many others of the Indian Ocean, and in the woods on
the coasts of Malabar, in his ancient state of in∣dependance. In his wild
condition, his plu∣mage is black and yellow, and his comb and wattles yellow
and purple. There is ano∣ther peculiarity also in those of the Indian
woods; their bones which when boiled with us are white, as every body knows, in
those are as black as ebony. Whether this tincture pro∣ceeds from their food,
as the bones are tinc∣tured red by feeding upon madder, I leave to the
discussion of others: satisfied with the fact, let us decline
speculation.</P>
<P>In their first propagation in Europe, there were
distinctions then that now subsist no longer. The ancients esteemed
those fowls whose plu∣mage was redish as invaluable; but as for the white
it was considered as utterly unfit for domestic purposes. These they
regarded as subject to become a prey to rapacious birds; and Aristotle
thinks them less fruitful than the former. Indeed, his division of those
birds seems taken from their culinary uses; the one sort he calls
generous and noble, being remark∣able for fecundity; the other sort, ignoble
and <PB N="163" REF="186"/> useless, from their sterility. These
distinctions differ widely from our modern notions of gene∣rosity in this
animal; that which we call the game-cock being by no means so fruitful as the
ungenerous dunghill-cock, which we treat with contempt. The Athenians had their
cock-matches as well as we; but it is probable they did not enter into our
refinement of chusing out the most barren of the species for the
pur∣poses of combat.</P>
<P>However this be, no animal in the world has greater courage than
the cock when opposed to one of his own species; and in every part of the
world where refinement and polished man∣ners have not entirely taken place,
cock-fighting is a principal diversion. In China, India, the Philipine
Islands, and all over the east, cock-fighting is the sport and
amusement even of kings and princes. With us it is declining every day; and
it is to be hoped it will in time become only the pastime of the lowest
vulgar. It is the opinion of many that we have a bolder and more valiant breed
than is to be found elsewhere; and some, indeed, have entered into a
serious discussion upon the cause of so flattering a
sin∣gularity. But the truth is, they have cocks in China as bold, if not
bolder, than ours; and, what would still be considered as valuable 
<PB N="164" REF="187"/> among cockers here, they have more strength with
less weight. Indeed, I have often won∣dered why men who lay two or three
hun∣dred pounds upon the prowess of a single cock, have not taken every
method to improve the breed. Nothing, it is probable, could do this more
effectually than by crossing the strain, as it is called, by a foreign
mixture; and whe∣ther having recourse even to the wild cock in the forests
of India would not be useful, I leave to their consideration. However, it
is a mean and ungenerous amusement, nor would I wish much to promote it.
The truth is, I could give such instructions with regard to cock-fighting,
and could so arm one of these animals against the other, that it would be
almost im∣possible for the adversary's cock to survive the first or
second blow; but, as Boerhave has said upon a former occasion, when he
was treating upon poisons, 
<Q REND="inline">"to teach the arts of cruelty is equivalent to
committing them."</Q></P>
<P>This extraordinary courage in the cock is thought to proceed
from his being the most salacious of all other birds whatsoever. A
single cock suffices for ten or a dozen hens; and it is said of him that
he is the only animal whose spirits are not abated by indulgence. But then
he soon grows old; the radical moisture is <PB N="165" REF="188"/>
exhausted; and in three or four years he be∣comes utterly unfit for the
purposes of impreg∣nation. 
<Q REND="inline">"Hens also," to use the words of
Wil∣loughby, "as they for the greatest part of the year daily lay eggs,
cannot suffice for so many births, but for the most part after three
years become effete and barren: for when they have exhausted all their
seed-eggs, of which they had but a certain quantity from the begin∣ning, they
must necessarily cease to lay, there being no new ones generated
within."</Q></P>
<P>The hen seldom clutches a brood of chickens above once a
season, though instances have been known in which they produced two. The
number of eggs a domestic hen will lay in the year are above two hundred,
provided she be well fed and supplied with water and liberty. It matters
not much whether she be trodden by the cock or no; she will continue to
lay, al∣though all the eggs of this kind can never by hatching be brought to
produce a living ani∣mal. Her nest is made without any care, if left to
herself; a hole scratched into the ground, among a few bushes, is the
only preparation she makes for this season of patient expectation.
Nature, almost exhausted by its own fecundity, seems to inform her of the
proper time for hatching, which she herself testifies by a clucking 
<PB N="166" REF="189"/> note, and by discontinuing to lay. The good
housewives, who often get more by their hens laying than by their chickens,
often artifi∣cially protract this clucking season, and some∣times
entirely remove it. As soon as their hen begins to cluck, they stint her in
her provisions; which, if that fails, they plunge her into cold water; this,
for the time, effectually puts back her hatching; but then it often kills the
poor bird, who takes cold and dies under the operation.</P>
<P>If left entirely to herself, the hen would sel∣dom lay above
twenty eggs in the same nest, without attempting to hatch them: but in
pro∣portion as she lays, her eggs are removed; and she continues to lay,
vainly hoping to encrease the number. In the wild state, the hen seldom
lays above fifteen eggs; but then her provision is more difficultly obtained,
and she is perhaps sensible of the difficulty of maintaining too numerous
a family.</P>
<P>When the hen begins to sit, nothing can exceed her
perseverance and patience; she con∣tinues for some days immoveable; and
when forced away by the importunities of hunger, she quickly returns.
Sometimes also her eggs become too hot for her to bear, especially if she
be furnished with too warm a nest within doors, for then she is obliged
to leave them to cool a little: thus the warmth of the nest only retards 
<PB N="167" REF="190"/> incubation, and often puts the brood a day or two back
in the shell. While the hen sits, she carefully turns her eggs, and even
removes them to different situations; till at length, in about three weeks,
the young brood begin to give signs of a desire to burst their
confinement. When by the repeated efforts of their bill, which serves like a
pioneer on this occasion, they have broke themselves a passage through
the shell, the hen still continues to sit till all are excluded. The
strongest and best chickens generally are the first candidates for
liberty; the weakest come behind, and some even die in the shell. When
all are produced, she then leads them forth to provide for themselves. Her
affection and her pride seem then to alter her very nature, and correct her
imperfections. No longer voracious or cowardly, she abstains from all food
that her young can swallow, and flies boldly at every creature that she
thinks is likely to do them mischief. Whatever the invading animal be, she
boldly attacks him; the horse, the hog, or the mastiff. When marching at
the head of her little troop, she acts the commander, and has a variety of
notes to call her numerous train to their food, or to warn them of approaching
danger. Upon one of these occasions, I have seen the whole brood run for
security into the <PB N="168" REF="191"/> thickest part of an hedge, while
the hen herself ventured boldly forth, and faced a fox that came for plunder.
With a good mastiff, how∣ever, we soon sent the invader back to his
re∣treat; but not before he had wounded the hen in several places.</P>
<P>Ten or twelve chickens are the greatest num∣ber that a good
hen can rear and clutch at a time; but as this bears no proportion to the
number of her eggs, schemes have been ima∣gined to clutch all the eggs of an
hen, and thus turn her produce to the greatest advantage. By these
contrivances it has been obtained that a hen that ordinarily produces but
twelve chickens in the year, is found to produce as many chickens as eggs, and
consequently often above two hundred. The contrivance I mean is the
ar∣tificial method of hatching chickens in stoves, as is practised at Grand
Cairo; or in a chy∣mical elaboratory properly graduated, as has been effected
by Mr. Reaumur. At Grand Cairo, they thus produce six or seven thousand
chickens at a time; where, as they are brought forth in their mild spring,
which is warmer than our summer, the young ones thrive without clutching. But
it is otherwise in our colder and unequal climate; the little animal may,
without much difficulty, be hatched from the <PB N="169" REF="192"/> shell;
but they almost all perish when excluded. To remedy this, Reaumur has made
use of a woolen hen, as he calls it; which was nothing more than putting the
young ones in a warm basket, and clapping over them a thick woolen canopy. I
should think a much better substitute might be found; and this from among
the spe∣cies themselves. Capons may very easily be taught to clutch a
fresh brood of chickens throughout the year; so that when one little colony
is thus reared, another may be brought to succeed it. Nothing is more common
than to see capons thus employed; and the manner of teaching them is this:
first the capon is made very tame, so as to feed from one's hand; then,
about evening, they pluck the feathers off his breast, and rub the bare
skin with nettles; they then put the chickens to him, which presently run
under his breast and belly, and probably rubbing his bare skin gently with
their heads, allay the stinging pain which the nettles had just produced.
This is repeated for two or three nights, till the animal takes an affection to
the chickens that have thus given him relief, and continues to give them the
protection they seek for: perhaps also the querulous voice of the chickens
may be pleasant to him in misery, and invite him to succour the
distrest. He from <PB N="170" REF="193"/> that time brings up a brood of
chickens like a hen, clutching them, feeding them, clucking, and performing all
the functions of the tenderest parent. A capon once accustomed to this
ser∣vice, will not give over; but when one brood is grown up, he may have
another nearly hatched put under him, which he will treat with the same
tenderness he did the former.</P>
<P>The cock, from his salaciousness, is allowed to be a
short lived animal; but how long these birds live, if left to themselves,
is not yet well ascertained by any historian. As they are kept only for
profit, and in a few years become unfit for generation, there are few that,
from mere motives of curiosity, will make the tedious experiment of
maintaining a proper number till they die. Aldrovandus hints their age to be
ten years; and it is probable that this may be its extent. They are subject
to some disorders, which it is not our business to describe; and as
for poisons, besides nux vomica, which is fatal to most animals except
man, they are injured, as Linnaeus asserts, by elder-berries; of which they
are not a little fond.</P>

<PB N="171" REF="194"/>
<HEAD>CHAP III. Of the Peacock.</HEAD>
<P>THE Peacock, by the common people of Italy, is said to have
the plumage of an angel, the voice of a devil, and the guts of a thief. In
fact, each of these qualities mark pretty well the nature of this
extraordinary bird. When it appears with its tail expanded, there is none of
the feathered creation can vie with it for beauty; yet the horrid scream of
its voice serves to abate the pleasure we find from viewing it; and still
more, its insatiable gluttony and spirit of depredation make it one of the
most noxious domestics that man has taken under his protection.</P>
<P>Our first peacocks were brought from the East Indies; and we
are assured, that they are still found in vast flocks, in a wild
state, in the islands of Java and Ceylone. So beautiful a bird, and one
esteemed such a delicacy at the tables of the luxurious, could not be
permitted to con∣tinue long at liberty in its distant retreats. So early as
the days of Solomon, we find in his navies, among the articles imported from
the East, apes and peacocks. Aelian relates, <PB N="172" REF="195"/> that they
were brought into Greece from some barbarous country, and were held in such
high esteem among them, that a male and female were valued at above thirty
pounds of our money. We are told also, that when Alexander was in India, he
found them flying wild, in vast numbers, on the banks of the river Hya∣rotis,
and was so struck with their beauty, that he laid a severe fine and
punishment on all who should kill or disturb them. Nor are we to be
suprized at this, as the Greeks were so much struck with the beauty of
this bird, when first brought among them, that every person paid a fixed
price for seeing it; and several people came to Athens, from Lace∣demon and
Thessaly, purely to satisfy their cu∣riosity.</P>
<P>It was probably first introduced into the West, merely on
account of its beauty; but mankind, from contemplating its figure, soon came
to think of serving it up for a different en∣tainment. Aufidius Hurco
stands charged by Pliny with being the first who fatted up the peacock for
the feasts of the luxurious. What∣ever there may be of delicacy in the
flesh of a young peacock, it is certain an old one is very indifferent
eating; nevertheless, there is no mention made of chusing the youngest:
it is <PB N="173" REF="196"/> probable they were killed indiscriminately, the
beauty of the feathers in some measure stimu∣lating the appetite.
Hortensius the orator was the first who served them up at an
entertainment at Rome; and from that time they were con∣sidered as one of the
greatest ornaments of every feast. Whether the Roman method of cookery,
which was much higher than ours, might not have rendered them more palatable
than we find them at present, I cannot tell: but certain it is, they talk of
the peacock as being the first of viands.</P>
<P>Its fame for delicacy, however, did not con∣tinue very long; for
we find, in the times of Francis the First, that it was a custom to serve
up peacocks to the tables of the great, with an intention not to be eaten, but
only to be seen. Their manner was to strip off the skin; and then
preparing the body with the warmest spices, they covered it up again in its
former skin, with all its plumage in full display, and no way injured by
the preparation. The bird thus prepared, was often preserved for many years
without corrupting; and it is asserted of the peacock's flesh, that it
keeps longer unputrefied than that of any other animal. To give a higher zest
to these entertainments, on weddings particularly, they filled the bird's
beak and throat with cotton <PB N="174" REF="197"/> and camphire, which they
set on fire, to amuse and delight the company. I do not know that the
peacock is much used at our entertainments at present, except now and then
at an alderman's dinner or a common-council feast, when our citizens
resolve to be splendid; and even then it is never served with its cotton
and camphire.</P>
<P>Like other birds of the poultry kind, the peacock feeds upon
corn; but its chief predi∣lection is for barley. But as it is a very proud and
fickle bird, there is scarce any food that it will not at times covet and
pursue. Insects and tender plants are often eagerly sought at a time that
it has a sufficiency of its natural food pro∣vided more nearly. In the
indulgence of these capricious pursuits, walls cannot easily confine it;
it strips the tops of houses of their tiles or thatch, it lays waste the
labours of the gardener, roots up his choicest seeds, and nips his
favourite flowers in the bud. Thus its beauty but ill re∣compenses for the
mischief it occasions; and many of the more homely looking fowls are very
deservedly preferred before it.</P>
<P>Nor is the peacock less a debauchee in its affections, than a
glutton in its appetites. He is still more salacious than even the cock;
and though not possessed of the same vigour, yet burns with more
immoderate desire. He re∣quires <PB N="175" REF="198"/> five females at
least to attend him; and if there be not a sufficient number, he will even
run upon and tread the sitting hen. For this reason, the pea-hen
endeavours, as much as she can, to hide her nest from the male, as he would
otherwise disturb her sitting, and break her eggs.</P>
<P>The pea-hen seldom lays above five or six eggs in this
climate before she sits. Aristotle describes her as laying twelve; and
it is pro∣bable, in her native climate, she may be thus prolific; for it is
certain, that in the forests where they breed naturally, they are numerous
beyond expression. This bird lives about twenty years; and not till its
third year has it that beau∣tiful variegated plumage that adorns its tail.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"In the kingdom of Cambaya," says Tave∣ner,
"near the city of Baroch, whole flocks of them are seen in the fields. They
are very shy, however, and it is impossible to come near them. They run
off swifter than the partridge; and hide themselves in thickets, where it
is impossible to find them. They perch, by night, upon trees; and the
fowler often approaches them at that season with a kind of banner, on which
a peacock is painted to the life, on either side. A lighted torch is fixed on
the top of this decoy; and the peacock, when disturbed, flies to what it
takes <PB N="176" REF="199"/> for another, and is thus caught in a nooze
prepared for that purpose."</Q></P>
<P>There are varieties of this bird, some of which are white,
others crested: that which is called the Peacock of Thibet, is the most
beautiful of the feathered creation, containing in its plumage all the most
vivid colours, red, blue, yellow, and green, disposed in an almost
artificial order, as if merely to please the eye of the beholder.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. The Turkey.</HEAD>
<P>THE natal place of the cock and the peacock is pretty well
ascertained, but there are stronger doubts concerning the Turkey; some
contend∣ing that it has been brought into Europe from the East Indies many
centuries ago; while others assert, that it is wholly unknown in that part
of the world, that it is a native of the New Continent, and that it was not
brought into Europe till the discovery of that part of the world.</P>
<P>Those who contend for the latter opinion, very truly
observe, that among all the descrip∣tions we have of Eastern birds, that
of the turkey is not to be found; while, on the contrary, it is very well known
in the New Continent, where it runs wild about the woods. It is said, by
them, to be first seen in France, in the reign of Francis the First; and
in England, in that of Henry the Eighth; which is about the time when Mexico
was first conquered by Spain. On the other hand, it is asserted, that the
turkey, so far from being unknown in Eu∣rope before that time, was known even
to the <PB N="178" REF="201"/> antients; and that Aelian has given a pretty
just description of it. They alledge, that its very name implies its having
been brought from some part of the East; and that it is found, among other
dainties served up to the tables of the great, before that time among
ourselves. But what they pretend to be the strongest proof is, that
though the wild turkey be so very com∣mon in America, yet the natives cannot
con∣trive to tame it; and though hatched in the ordinary manner, nothing can
render it domestic. In this diversity of opinions, perhaps it is best to
suspend assent, till more lights are thrown on the subject; however,
I am inclined to concur with the former opinion.</P>
<P>With us, when young, it is one of the ten∣derest of all birds;
yet, in its wild state, it is found in great plenty in the forests of
Canada, that are covered with snow above three parts of the year. In their
natural woods, they are found much larger than in their state of domestic
captivity. They are much more beautiful also, their feathers being of a dark
grey, bordered at the edges with a bright gold colour. These the savages of
the country weave into cloaks to adorn their persons, and fashion into fans
and umbrellas, but never once think of taking into keeping animals that the
woods furnish <PB N="179" REF="202"/> them with in sufficient abundance.
Savage man seems to find a delight in precarious possession. A great
part of the pleasure of the chace lies in the uncertainty of the pursuit,
and he is un∣willing to abridge himself in any accidental success that
may attend his fatigues. The hunting the turkey therefore, makes one of his
principal diversions; as its flesh contributes chiefly to the support of
his family. When he has discovered the place of their retreat, which, in
general, is near fields of nettles, or where there is plenty of any kind of
grain, he takes his dog with him, which is trained to the sport, (a faithful
rough creature, supposed to be originally reclaimed from the wolf) and he
sends him into the midst of the flock. The turkies no sooner perceive
their enemy, than they set off running at full speed, and with such
swiftness that they leave the dog far behind them: he follows
nevertheless, and sensible they must soon be tired, as they cannot go
full speed for any length of time, he, at last, forces them to take
shelter in a tree, where they sit quite spent and fatigued, till the
hunter comes up, and, with a long pole, knocks them down one after the
other.</P>
<P>This manner of suffering themselves to be destroyed,
argues no great instinct in the ani∣mal; <PB N="180" REF="203"/> and indeed,
in their captive state, they do not appear to be possessed of much.
They seem a stupid, vain, querulous tribe, apt enough to quarrel among
themselves, yet without any weapons to do each other an injury. Every body
knows the strange antipathy the turkey-cock has to a red colour; how he
bristles, and, with his peculiar gobbling sound, flies to at∣tack it. But
there is another method of encreas∣ing the animosity of these birds
against each other, which is often practised by boys, when they have a mind
for a battle. This is no more than to smear over the head of one of the
turkies with dirt, and the rest run to attack it with all the speed of
impotent animosity: nay, two of them, thus disguised, will fight each
other till they are almost suffocated with fatigue and anger.</P>
<P>But though so furious among themselves, they are weak and
cowardly against other animals, though far less powerful than they. The
cock often makes the turkey keep at a distance; and they seldom venture to
attack him but with united force, when they rather oppress him by their
weight, than annoy him by their arms. There is no animal, how contemptible
soever, that will venture boldly to face the turkey-cock, that he will not
fly from. On the contrary, with the insolence of a bully, he pursues any 
<PB N="181" REF="204"/> thing that seems to fear him, particularly lap-dogs
and children, against both which he seems to have a peculiar aversion. On
such occasions, after he has made them scamper, he returns to his female
train, displays his plumage around, struts about the yard, and gobbles out
a note of self-approbation.</P>
<P>The female seems of a milder, gentler dis∣position. Rather
querulous than bold, she hunts about in quest of grain, and pursuit of
insects, being particularly delighted with the eggs of ants and caterpillars.
She lays eighteen or twenty eggs, larger than those of a hen, whitish, but
marked with spots resembling the freckles of the face. Her young are
extremely tender at first, and must be carefully fed with curd chopped with
dock leaves; but as they grow older, they become more hardy, and fol∣low the
mother to considerable distances, in pursuit of insect food, which they
prefer to any other. On these occasions, however, the female, though so
large and, as it would seem, so powerful a bird, gives them but very little
protection against the attacks of any rapacious animal that comes in her way.
She rather warns her young to shift for themselves, than prepares to defend
them. 
<Q REND="inline">"I have heard," <PB N="182" REF="205"/> says
the Abbe la Pluche, "a turkey hen, when at the head of her brood, send forth
the most hideous scream, without knowing as yet the cause: however, her
young, immediately when the warning was given, skulked under the bushes,
the grass, or whatever else offered for shelter or protection. They even
stretched themselves at their full length upon the ground, and continued
lying as motionless as if they were dead. In the mean time, the mother, with
her eyes directed upwards, continued her cries and screaming as before. Upon
looking up to where she seemed to gaze, I discovered a black spot
just under the clouds, but was unable at first to determine what it was;
however, it soon appeared to be a bird of prey, though at first at too
great a distance to be distinguished. I have seen one of these
animals continue in this violent agitated state, and her whole brood pinned
down as it were to the ground, for four hours together; whilst their
formidable soe has taken his circuits, has mounted, and hovered directly over
their heads: at last, upon disappearing, the parent began to change her
note, and sent forth another cry, which in an instant gave life to the
whole trembling tribe, and they all flocked round her with expressions of 
<PB N="183" REF="206"/> pleasure, as if conscious of their happy escape
from danger."</Q></P>
<P>When once grown up, turkies are very hardy birds, and feed
themselves at very little expence to the farmer. Those of Norfolk are
said to be the largest of this kingdom, weighing from twenty to thirty
pounds. There are places, however, in the East Indies, where they are known
only in their domestic state, in which they grow to the weight of sixty
pounds.</P>

<PB N="184" REF="207"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. V. The Pheasant.</HEAD>
<P>IT would surprize a sportsman to be told that the
pheasant which he finds wild in the woods, in the remotest parts of the
kingdom, and in fo∣rests, which can scarce be said to have an owner, is a
foreign bird, and was at first artificially propagated amongst us. They
were brought into Europe from the banks of the Phasis, a river of Colchis, in
Asia Minor; and from whence they still retain their name.</P>
<P>Next to the peacock, they are the most beau∣tiful of birds, as
well for the vivid colour of their plumes as for their happy mixtures and
variety. It is far beyond the power of the pen∣cil to draw any thing so
glossy, so bright, or points so finely blending into each other. We are
told that when Craesus, king of Lydia, was seated on his throne, adorned
with royal magnificence, and all the barbarous pomp of eastern splendour,
he asked Solon if he had ever beheld any thing so fine! The Greek
phi∣losopher, no way moved by the objects before him, or taking a pride in
his native simplicity, replied, that after having seen the beautiful 
<PB N="185" REF="208"/> plumage of the pheasant, he could be astonished at
no other finery.</P>
<P>In fact, nothing can satisfy the eye with a greater variety
and richness of ornament than this beautiful creature. The iris of the eyes
is yellow; and the eyes themselves are surrounded with a scarlet colour,
sprinkled with small specks of black. On the fore-part of the head there
are blackish feathers mixed with a shining purple. The top of the head and
the upper part of the neck are tinged with a darkish green that shines like
silk In some, the top of the head is of a shining blue, and the head
itself, as well as the upper part of the neck, appears sometimes blue and
sometimes green, as it is differently placed to the eye of the spectator.
The feathers of the breast, the shoulders, the middle of the back, and the
sides under the wings, have a blackish ground, with edges tinged of an
exquisite colour, which appears sometimes black and sometimes purple,
accord∣ing to the different lights it is placed in; under the purple there is a
transverse streak of gold colour. The tail, from the middle feathers to
the root, is about eighteen inches long; the legs, the feet and the toes, are
of the colour of horn. There are black spurs on the legs, shorter than
those of a cock; there is a mem∣brane <PB N="186" REF="209"/> that connects
two of the toes together; and the male is much more beautiful than the
female.</P>
<P>This bird, though so beautiful to the eye, is not less
delicate when served up to the table. Its flesh is considered as the
greatest dainty; and when the old physicians spoke of the
whole∣someness of any viands, they made their com∣parison with the
flesh of the pheasant. How∣ever, notwithstanding all these perfections
to tempt the curiosity or the palate, the pheasant has multiplied in its
wild state; and, as if disdaining the protection of man, has left him to
take shelter in the thickest woods and the remotest forests. All others
of the domestic kind, the cock, the turkey, or the pintada, when once
reclaimed, have still continued in their domestic state, and persevered
in the ha∣bits and appetites of willing slavery. But the pheasant, though
taken from its native warm retreats, where the woods supply variety of food,
and the warm sun suits its tender con∣stitution, has still continued
its attachment to native freedom; and now wild among us, makes the most
envied ornament of our parks and fo∣rests, where he feeds upon acorns and
berries, and the scanty produce of our chilling cli∣mate.</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="210"/>This spirit of independance seems to
attend the pheasant even in captivity. In the woods, the hen pheasant lays
from eighteen to twenty eggs in a season; but in a domestic state she
seldom lays above ten. In the same manner, when wild, she hatches and
leads up her brood with patience, vigilance and courage; but when kept tame,
she never sits well; so that a hen is generally her substitute upon
such occa∣sions; and as for leading her young to their food, she is
utterly ignorant of where it is to be found; and the young birds starve, if
left solely to her protection. The pheasant, there∣fore, on every account,
seems better left at large in the woods than reclaimed to pristine
captivity. Its fecundity when wild is sufficient to stock the forest; its
beautiful plumage adorns it; and its flesh retains a higher flavour from its
unlimited freedom.</P>
<P>However, it has been the aim of late to take these birds once
more from the woods, and to keep them in places fitted for their reception.
Like all others of the poultry kind, they have no great sagacity, and
suffer themselves easily to be taken. At night they roost upon the
highest trees of the wood; and by day they come down into the lower brakes
and bushes, where their food is chiefly found. They gene∣rally 
<PB N="188" REF="211"/> make a kind of flapping noise when they are with the
females; and this often apprizes the sportsman of their retreats. At other
times he tracks them in the snow, and frequently takes them in springs. But
of all birds they are shot most easily, as they always make a whirring
noise when they rise, by which they alarm the gunner, and being a large
mark, and flying very slow, there is scarce any missing them.</P>
<Q> 
<L>Ah! what avail his glossy, varying dyes,</L> 
<L>His purpled crest and scarlet-circled eyes,</L> 
<L>The vivid green his shining plumes unfold,</L> 
<L>His painted wings, and breast that flames with gold?</L> 
<BIBL>POPE.</BIBL></Q>
<P>When these birds are taken young into keep∣ing, they become as
familiar as chickens; and when they are designed for breeding, they are put
together in a yard, five hens to a cock; for this bird, like all of the poultry
kind, is very salacious. In her natural state the female makes her nest
of dry grass and leaves; the same must be laid for her in the
pheasandry, and she herself will sometimes properly dispose them.
If she refuses to hatch her eggs, then a common hen must be got to
supply her place, which task she will perform with perseverance and
success. The young ones are very difficult to be reared; and they must be
supplied with <PB N="189" REF="212"/> ants-eggs, which is the food the old one
leads them to gather when wild in the woods. To make these go the farther,
they are to be chop∣ped up with curds or other meat; and the young ones are to
be fed with great exactness, both as to the quantity and the time of their
supply. This food is sometimes also to be varied, and wood-lice, ear
wigs, and other insects, are to make a variety. The place where they are
reared must be kept extremely clean; their water must be changed twice or
thrice a day; they must not be exposed till the dew is off the ground in
the morning; and they should always be taken in before sun-set. When they
be∣come adult, they very well can shift for them∣selves, but they are
particularly fond of oats and barley.</P>
<P>In order to encrease the breed, and make it still more
valuable, Longolius teaches us a me∣thod that appears very peculiar. The
pheasant is a very bold bird when first brought into the yard among other
poultry, not sparing the pea∣cock, nor even such young cocks and hens as it
can master; but after a time it will live tamely among them, and will at
last be brought to couple with a common hen. The breed thus produced take
much stronger after the pheasant than the hen; and in a few
successions, if they <PB N="190" REF="213"/> be let to breed with the
cock-pheasant, for the mixture is not barren, there will be produced a
species more tame, stronger, and more prolific; so that he adds, that it
is strange why most of our pheasandries are not stocked with birds
produced in this manner.</P>
<P>The pheasant, when full grown, seems to feed indifferently
upon every thing that offers. It is said by a French writer, that one of the
king's sportsmen shooting at a parcel of crows, that were gathered round
a dead car∣case, to his great surprize upon coming up, found that he had
killed as many pheasants as crows. It is even asserted by some, that
such is the carnivorous disposition of this bird, that when several of
them are put together in the same yard, if one of them happens to fall
sick, or seems to be pining, that all the rest will fall upon, kill, and
devour it. Such is the lan∣guage of books; those who have frequent
op∣portunities of examining the manners of the bird itself, know what credit
ought to be given to such an account.</P>
<P>Of the pheasant, as of all other domestic fowl, there are
many varieties. There are white pheasants, crested pheasants, spotted
pheasants; but of all others, the golden pheasant of China is the most
beautiful. It is a doubt whether the <PB N="191" REF="214"/> peacock itself
can bear the comparison. However, the natives of China would not have us
consider it as their most beautiful bird, though all co∣vered over with
eyes, resembling in miniature those of a peacock. By their accounts, it is
far exceeded by the fongwhang, an imaginary bird, of which they give a most
phantastic de∣scription. It is thus that the people of every country,
though possessed of the greatest ad∣vantages, have still others
that they would persuade strangers they enjoy, which have ex∣istence only
in the imagination.</P>

<PB N="192" REF="215"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. VI. The Pintada or Guinea-Hen.</HEAD>
<P>THIS is a very remarkable bird, and in some measure unites
the characteristics of the phea∣sant and the turkey. It has the fine
delicate shape of the one, and the bare head of the other. To be more
particular, it is about the size of a common hen; but as it is supported on
longer legs it looks much larger. It has a round back, with a tail turned
downwards like a partridge. The head is covered with a kind of casque; and
the whole plumage is black or dark grey, speckled with white spots. It has
wattles under the bill, which do not proceed from the lower chap as in cocks,
but from the upper, which gives it a very peculiar air, while its restless
gait and odd chuckling sound distinguish it sufficiently from all other
birds whatever.</P>
<P>It is well known all over Europe, and even better than with us,
as the nations that border on the Mediterranean probably had it before us from
those parts of Africa which lay nearest. Accordingly we find it in
different countries called by different names, from the place whence they had
it. They are by <PB N="193" REF="216"/> some called the Barbary-hen; by
others, the Tamis bird; and by others, the bird of Nu∣midia. We have given it
the name of that part of Africa from whence probably it was first
brought.</P>
<P>In many parts of their native country, they are seen in vast
flocks together, feeding their young, and leading them in quest of food. All
their habits are like those of the poultry-kind, and they agree in every
other respect, except that the male and female are so much alike, that they
can hardly be distinguished asun∣der. The only difference lies in the
wattles described above, which in the cock are of a blueish cast; in the
hen, they are more inclining to a red. Their eggs, like their bodies, are
speckled; in our climate, they lay but five or six in a season; but
they are far more prolific in their sultry regions at home. They are kept
among us rather for shew than use, as their flesh is not much esteemed,
and as they give a good deal of trouble in the rearing.</P>

<DIV2 N="7" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="194" REF="217"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. VII. The Bustard.</HEAD>
<P>THE Bustard is the largest land-bird that is a native of
Britain. It was once much more nu∣merous than it is at present; but the
encreased cultivation of the country, and the extreme delicacy of its
flesh, has greatly thinned the species; so that a time may come when it
may be doubted whether ever so large a bird was bred among us. It is probable
that long before this the bustard would have been extirpated, but for its
peculiar manner of feeding. Had it continued to seek shelter among our
woods, in proportion as they were cut down, it must have been destroyed. If
in the forest, the fowler might approach it without being seen; and the
bird, from its size, would be too great a mark to be easily missed. But
it inhabits only the open and extensive plain, where its food lies in
abundance, and where every invader may be seen at a distance.</P>
<P>The bustard is much larger than the turkey, the male generally
weighing from twenty-five to twenty seven pounds. The neck is a foot long,
and the legs a foot and a half. The <PB N="195" REF="218"/> wings are not
proportionable to the rest of the body, being but four feet from the tip of
one to the other; for which reason the bird flies with great difficulty. The
head and neck of the male are ash-coloured; the back is barred
transversely with black, bright, and rust colour. The greater quill
feathers are black; the belly white; and the tail, which consists of twenty
feathers, is marked with broad black bars.</P>
<P>It would seem odd, as was hinted before, how so large a
land-bird as this could find shelter in so cultivated a country as England;
but the wonder will cease when we find it only in the most open countries,
where there is scarce any approaching without being dis∣covered. They are
frequently seen in flocks of fifty or more, in the extensive downs of
Sa∣lisbury Plain, in the heaths of Suffex and Cam∣bridgeshire, the
Dorsetshire uplands, and so on as far as East Lothian in Scotland. In
those extensive plains, where there are no woods to screen the
sportsman, nor hedges to creep along, the bustards enjoy an indolent
security. Their food is composed of the berries that grow among the heath,
and the large earth-worms that appear in great quantities on the downs before
sun-rising in summer. It is in vain that the fowler creeps forward to
approach them, <PB N="196" REF="219"/> they have always centinels placed at
proper eminences, which are ever on the watch, and warn the flock of the
smallest appearance of danger. All therefore that is left the
sports∣man, is the comfortless view of their distant security. He may
wish, but they are in safety.</P>
<P>It sometimes happens that these birds, though they are
seldom shot by the gun, are often run down by grey-hounds. As they are
voracious and greedy, they often sacrifice their safety to their appetite,
and feed themselves so very fat, that they are unable to fly without great
preparation. When the grey-hound, therefore, comes within a certain distance,
the bustard runs off flapping its wings, and endeavouring to gather air
enough under them to rise; in the mean time, the enemy approaches nearer and
nearer, till it is too late for the bird even to think of obtaining safety by
flight; for just at the rise there is always time lost, and of this the
bird is sensible; it continues, therefore, on the foot until it has got a
sufficient way before the dog for flight, or until it is taken.</P>
<P>As there are few places where they can at once find proper food
and security, so they ge∣nerally continue near their old haunts, seldom
wandering above twenty or thirty miles from home. As their food is replete with
moisture, <PB N="197" REF="220"/> it enables them to live upon these dry
plains, where there are scarcely any springs of water, a long time without
drinking. Besides this, Nature has given the males an admirable ma∣gazine for
their security against thirst. This is a pouch, the entrance of which
lies im∣mediately under the tongue, and capable of holding near seven quarts
of water. This is probably filled upon proper occasions, to supply the hen
when sitting, or the young before they can fly.</P>
<P>Like all other birds of the poultry-kind, they change their
mates at the season of incubation, which is about the latter end of
summer. They separate in pairs if there be a sufficiency of fe∣males for
the males; but when this happens to be otherwise, the males fight until one
of them falls. In France, they often find some of those victims to
gallantry dead in the fields, and no doubt are not displeased at the
occasion.</P>
<P>They make their nests upon the ground, only just scraping
a hole in the earth, and some∣times lining it with a little long grass or
straw. There they lay two eggs only, almost of the size of a goose egg,
of a pale olive brown, marked with spots of a darker colour. They hatch for
about five weeks, and the young ones run about as soon as they are out of the
shell.</P>
<P><PB N="198" REF="221"/>The bustards assemble in flocks in
the month of October, and keep together till April. In winter, as their food
becomes more scarce, they support themselves indiscriminately, by
feeding on moles, mice, and even little birds, when they can seize them. For
want of other food, they are contented to live upon turnep leaves and such
like succulent vegetables. In some parts of Switzerland, they are found
frozen in the fields in severe weather; but when taken to a warm place they
again recover. They usually live fifteen years, and are incapable of being
propagated in a domestic state, as they probably want that food which
best agrees with their appetite.</P>

<PB N="199" REF="222"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. The Grous and its Affinities.</HEAD>
<P>THE Cock of the Wood, the Black Cock, the Grous, and the
Ptarmigan—These are all birds of a similar nature, and chiefly found
in heathy mountains and piny forests, at a distance from mankind. They
might once indeed have been common enough all over England, when a great part
of the country was covered with heath; but at present their numbers are
thinned: the two first of this kind are utterly unknown in the south, and
have taken refuge in the northern parts of Scotland, where the extensive
heaths afford them security, and the forests shelter.</P>
<P>The cock of the wood is sometimes of the size of a turkey,
and often weighs near four∣teen pounds; the black cock, of which the male is
all over black, though the female is of the colour of a partridge, is about the
size of a hen, and, like the former, is only found with us in the highlands
of Scotland; the grous is about half as large again as a partridge, and its
colour much like that of a wood-cock, but redder; the ptarmigan is still
somewhat less, <PB N="200" REF="223"/> and is of a pale brown or
ash-colour. They are all distinguishable from other birds of the poultry
kind, by a naked skin, of a scarlet colour, above the eyes, in the place
and of the figure of eye-brows.</P>
<P>It seems to be something extraordinary, that all the larger
wild animals of every species chuse the darkest and the inmost
recesses of the woods for their residence, while the smaller kinds come
more into the open and cultivated parts, where there is more food and more
danger. It is thus with the birds I am describing: while the cock of the wood
is seldom seen, except on the inaccessible parts of heathy mountains,
or in the midst of piny forests, the grous is found, in great numbers, in
the neighbourhood of corn∣fields, where there is heath to afford retreat and
shelter. Their food too somewhat differs; while the smaller kind lives
upon heath blossoms, cranberries, and corn, the larger feeds upon the cones
of the pine-tree; and will sometimes entirely strip one tree, before it
offers to touch those of another, though just beside him. In other
respects, the manners of these birds are the same; being both equally
simple in their diet, and licentious in their amours.</P>
<P>The Cock of the Wood, for it is from him we will take our
description, is, as was said, <PB N="201" REF="224"/> chiefly fond of a
mountainous and wooded situation. In winter he resides in the darkest and
inmost part of the woods; in summer he ventures down from his retreats, to
make short depredations on the farmer's corn. The deli∣cacy of his flesh in
some measure sets a high price upon his head; and as he is greatly
sought after, so he continues, when he comes down from the hills, always on
his guard. Upon these occasions, he is seldom surprized; and those
who would take him, must venture up to find him in his native retreats.</P>
<P>The cock of the wood, when in the forest, attaches himself
principally to the oak and the pine-tree; the cones of the latter serving for
his food, and the thick boughs for an habitation. He even makes a choice of
what cones he shall feed upon; for he sometimes will strip one tree bare
before he will deign to touch the cones of another. He feeds also upon ant's
eggs, which seem a high delicacy to all birds of the poultry kind:
cranberries are likewise often found in his crop; and his gizzard, like that
of domestic fowls, contains a quantity of gravel, for the purposes of
assisting his powers of digestion.</P>
<P>At the earliest return of spring, this bird begins to feel
the genial influence of the season. During the month of March, the
approaches <PB N="202" REF="225"/> of courtship are continued, and do not
desist till the trees have all their leaves, and the forest is in full
bloom. During this whole season, the cock of the wood is seen at
sun-rise, and setting extremely active upon one of the largest branches
of the pine-tree. With his tail raised and expanded like a fan, and the wings
drooping, he is seen walking backward and forward, his neck stretched out,
his head swolen and red, and making a thousand ridiculous postures: his
cry, upon that occasion, is a kind of loud explosion, which is instantly
followed by a noise like the whetting of a scythe, which ceases and
commences alternatively for about an hour, and is then terminated by the same
explosion.</P>
<P>During the time this singular cry continues, the bird seems
entirely deaf, and insensible of every danger: whatever noise may be made
near him, or even though fired at, he still con∣tinues his call; and this is
the time that sports∣men generally take to shoot him. Upon all other
occasions, he is the most timorous and watch∣ful bird in nature: but now he
seems entirely absorbed by his instincts; and seldom leaves the place
where he first begins to feel the accesses of desire. This
extraordinary cry, which is accompanied by a clapping of the wings, is no 
<PB N="203" REF="226"/> sooner finished, than the female hearing it
re∣plies, approaches, and places herself under the tree, from whence the cock
descends to im∣pregnate her. The number of females that, on this occasion,
resort to his call, is uncertain; but one male generally suffices for
all.</P>
<P>The female is much less than her mate, and entirely unlike him
in plumage, so that she might be mistaken for a bird of another
species: she seldom lays more than six or seven eggs, which are
white, and marked with yellow, of the size of a common hen's egg: she
generally lays them in a dry place and a mossy ground, and hatches them
without the company of the cock. When she is obliged, during the time of
incubation, to leave her eggs in quest of food, she covers them up so
artfully, with moss or dry leaves, that it is extremely difficult to
discover them. On this occasion, she is ex∣tremely tame and tranquil,
however wild and timorous in ordinary. She often keeps to her nest, though
strangers attempt to drag her away.</P>
<P>As soon as the young ones are hatched, they are seen running
with extreme agility after the mother, though sometimes they are not entirely
disengaged from the shell. The hen leads them forward, for the first
time, into the woods, <PB N="204" REF="227"/> shews them ant's eggs, and the
wild moun∣tain-berries, which, while young, are their only food. As they grow
older, their appetites grow stronger, and they then feed upon the tops of
hether and the cones of the pine-tree. In this manner they soon come to
perfection: they are an hardy bird, their food lies every where before them,
and it would seem that they should en∣crease in great abundance. But this
is not the case; their numbers are thinned by rapacious birds and beasts of
every kind; and still more by their own salacious contests.</P>
<P>As soon as the clutching is over, which the female performs in
the manner of an hen, the whole brood follows the mother for about a month or
two; at the end of which the young males entirely forsake her, and keep in
great harmony together till the beginning of spring. At this season, they
begin, for the first time, to feel the genial access; and then adieu to all
their former friendships! They begin to con∣sider each other as rivals; and
the rage of con∣cupiscence quite extinguishes the spirit of so∣ciety.
They fight each other, like game cocks; and at that time are so inattentive
to their own safety, that it often happens that two or three of them are
killed at a shot. It is probable, <PB N="205" REF="228"/> that in these
contests, the bird which comes off victorious takes possession of the
female sera∣glio, as it is certain they have no faithful at∣tachments<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This account of the Cock of the Wood is taken from the

<HEAD>CHAP. IX. Of the Partridge and its Varieties.</HEAD>
<P>THE Partridge may be particularly consi∣dered as belonging to
the sportsman. It is a bird which even our laws have taken under
protection; and, like a peacock or a hen, may be ranked as a private property.
The only difference now is, that we feed one in our farms, the other in our
yards; that these are contented captives; those, servants that have it in
their power to change their master, by changing their habitation.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"These birds," says Willoughby, "hold the
principal place in the feasts and entertainments of princes; without which
their feasts are esteemed ignoble, vulgar, and of no account. The Frenchmen
do so highly value, and are so fond of the partridge, that if they be
wanting, they utterly slight and despise the best spread tables; as
if there could be no feast without them."</Q> But however this might be in
the times of our historian, the partridge is now too common in France to be
considered as a delicacy; and this, as well as every other simple dish,
is exploded for luxuries of a more compound invention.</P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="230"/>In England, where the partridge is much
scarcer, and a great deal dearer, it is still a favourite delicacy at the
tables of the rich; and the desire of keeping it to themselves, has
in∣duced them to make laws for its preservation, no way harmonizing with the
general spirit of English legislation. What can be more arbi∣trary than
to talk of preserving the game; which, when defined, means no more than that
the poor shall abstain from what the rich have taken a fancy to keep for
themselves? If these birds could, like a cock or a hen, be made legal
property, could they be taught to keep within certain districts, and only
feed on those grounds that belong to the man whose enter∣tainments they
improve, it then might, with some shew of justice, be admitted, that as a
man fed them so he might claim them. But this is not the case; nor is it in
any man's power to lay a restraint upon the liberty of these birds, that,
when let loose, put no limits to their excursions. They feed every where;
upon every man's ground; and no man can say, these birds are fed only by
me. Those birds which are nou∣rished by all, belong to all; nor can any one
man, or any set of men, lay claim to them, when still continuing in a
state of nature.</P>
<P>I never walked out about the environs of <PB N="208" REF="231"/>
Paris, that I did not consider the immense quantity of game that was
running almost tame on every side of me, as a badge of the slavery of the
people; and what they wished me to observe as an object of triumph, I
always re∣garded with a kind of secret compassion: yet this people have
no game-laws for the remoter parts of the kingdom; the game is only
pre∣served in a few places for the king; and is free in most places else.
In England, the prohi∣bition is general; and the peasant has not a right to
what even slaves, as he is taught to call them, are found to
possess.</P>
<P>Of partridges there are two kinds; the grey and the red. The red
partridge is the largest of the two, and often perches upon trees; the grey,
with which we are best acquainted in England, is most prolific, and always
keeps on the ground.</P>
<P>The partridge seems to be a bird well known all over the
world, as it is found in every country, and in every climate; as well in the
frozen regions about the pole, as the torrid tracts under the equator. It even
seems to adapt itself to the nature of the climate where it resides. In
Greenland, the partridge, which is brown in summer, as soon as the icy
winter sets in, begins to take a covering suited to the 
<PB N="209" REF="232"/> season: it is then cloathed with a warm down
beneath; and its outward plumage assumes the colour of the snows
amongst which it seeks its food. Thus it is doubly fitted for the place, by
the warmth and the colour of its plumage; the one to defend it from the cold,
the other to prevent its being noticed by the enemy. Those of Barakonda, on
the other hand, are longer legged, much swifter of foot, and chuse the
highest rocks and precipices to reside in.</P>
<P>They all, however, agree in one character, of being immoderately
addicted to venery; and, as some writers affirm, often to an unnatural
degree. It is certain, the male will pursue the hen even to her nest; and
will break, her eggs, rather than not indulge his inclinations. Though the
young ones have kept together in flocks during the winter, when they begin to
pair in spring, their society disperses; and combats, very terrible
with respect to each other, ensue. Their manners, in other circumstances,
re∣semble all those of poultry in general; but their cunning and
instincts seem superior to those of the larger kinds. Perhaps, as they
live in the very neighbourhood of their enemies, they have more frequent
occasion to put their little arts in practice; and learn, by habit, the means
of <PB N="210" REF="233"/> evasion or safety. Whenever, therefore, a dog or
other formidable animal approaches their nest, the female uses every means
to draw him away. She keeps just before him, pretends to be incapable of
flying, just hops up and then falls down before him, but never goes off so
far as to discourage her pursuer. At length, when she has drawn him
entirely away from her secret treasure, she at once takes wing, and
fairly leaves him to gaze after her in despair.</P>
<P>After the danger is over, and the dog with∣drawn, she then
calls her young, who assemble at once at her cry, and follow where she
leads them. There are generally from ten to fifteen in a covey; and, if
unmolested, they live from fifteen to seventeen years.</P>
<P>There are several methods of taking them, as is well known;
that by which they are taken in a net, with a setting dog, is the most
pleasant, as well as the most secure. The dog, as every body knows, is
trained to this exercise, by a long course of education: by blows and
caresses he is taught to lie down at the word of command; a partridge is
shewn him, and he is then ordered to lie down; he is brought into the field,
and when the sportsman perceives where the covey lies, he orders his dog to
crouch: at length the <PB N="211" REF="234"/> dog, from habit, crouches wherever
he ap∣proaches a covey; and this is the signal which the sportsman
receives for unfolding and co∣vering the birds with his net. A covey thus
caught, is sometimes fed in a place proper for their reception; but they can
never be tho∣roughly tamed, like the rest of our domestic poultry.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="10" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="212" REF="235"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. X. The Quail.</HEAD>
<P>THE last of the poultry kind that I shall mention is the
Quail; a bird much smaller than any of the former, being not above half the
size of a partridge. The feathers of the head are black, edged with rusty
brown; the breast is of a pale yellowish red, spotted with black; the
feathers on the back are marked with lines of pale yellow, and the legs are of
a pale hue. Except in the colours thus described, and the size, it every
way resembles a partridge in shape; and, except that it is a bird of
passage, all others of the poultry kind, in its habits and nature.</P>
<P>The quail is by all known to be a bird of passage; and yet
if we consider its heavy man∣ner of flying, and its dearth of plumage, with
respect to its corpulence, we shall be surprized how a bird so
apparently ill qualified for mi∣gration, should take such extensive
journeys. Nothing however is more certain: 
<Q REND="inline">"When we sailed from Rhodes to Alexandria,"
says Bel∣lonius, "about autumn, many quails, flying from the north to the
south, were taken in our ship; and sailing at spring-time the contrary 
<PB N="213" REF="236"/> way, from the south to the north, I observed them on
their return, when many of them were taken in the same manner."</Q> This
ac∣count is confirmed by many others; who aver, that they chuse a north wind
for these adven∣tures; the south wind being very unfavourable, as it
retards their flight, by moistening their plumage. They then fly two by two;
con∣tinuing, when their way lies over land, to go faster by night than by
day; and to fly very high, to avoid being surprized or set upon by birds of
prey. However, it still remains a doubt whether quails take such long
journies as Bel∣lonius has made them perform. It is now asserted by some,
that the quail only migrates from one province of a country to another. For
instance, in England, they fly from the inland counties, to those bordering
on the sea, and continue there all the winter. If frost or snow drive
them out of the stubble fields or marshes, they then retreat to the sea
side, shelter themselves among the weeds, and live upon what is thrown up
from the sea upon shore. Particularly in Essex, the time of their
appearance upon the coasts of that country exactly coincides with their
disappearance from the more internal parts of the kingdom; so 
<PB N="214" REF="237"/> that what has been said of their long flights, is
probably not so well founded as is generally supposed.</P>
<P>These birds are much less prolific than the partridge;
seldom laying more than six or seven whitish eggs, marked with ragged,
rust coloured spots. But their ardour in courtship yields scarce to any
other bird, as they are fierce and cruel at that season to each other,
fighting most desperately, and (a punishment they richly de∣serve)
being at that time very easily taken. Quail-fighting was a favourite
amusement among the Athenians: they abstained from the flesh of this
bird, deeming it unwholesome, as supposing that it fed upon the white
hellebore; but they reared great numbers of them, for the pleasure of
seeing them fight; and staked sums of money, as we do with regard to
cocks, upon the success of the combat. Fashion, however, has at present
changed with regard to this bird; we take no pleasure in its courage, but its
flesh is considered as a very great delicacy.</P>
<P>Quails are easily caught by a call: the fowler, early in the
morning, having spread his net, hides himself under it, among the corn; he
then imitates the voice of the female, with his quail-pipe, which the cock
hearing, approaches with the utmost assiduity; when he has got under 
<PB N="215" REF="238"/> the net, the fowler then discovers himself, and
terrifies the quail, who attempting to get away, entangles himself the more
in the net, and is taken. The quail may thus very well serve to illustrate
the old adage, that every passion, carried to an inordinate excess, will
at last lead to ruin.</P>

<HEAD>PART III. OF BIRDS OF THE PIE KIND.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="part">
<PB N="219" REF="240"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. I. Birds of the Pie Kind.</HEAD>
<P>IN marshalling our army of the feathered creation, we have
placed in the van a race of birds long bred to war, and whose passion is
slaughter; in the center we have placed the slow and heavy laden, that are
usually brought into the field to be destroyed; we now come to a kind of
light infantry, that partake some∣thing of the spirit of the two former,
and yet belonging to neither. In this class we must be content to marshal
a numerous irregular tribe, va∣riously armed, with different pursuits,
appetites, and manners; not formidably formed for war, and yet generally
delighting in mischief; not slowly and usefully obedient, and yet without
any professed enmity to the rest of their fellow tenants of air.</P>
<P>To speak without metaphor, under this class of birds we may
arrange all that noisy, restless, chattering, teizing tribe that lies
between the hen and the thrush, that, from the size of the raven down to
that of the wood-pecker, flutter round our habitations and, rather with the
spirit <PB N="220" REF="241"/> of pilferers than of robbers, make free with
the fruits of human industry.</P>
<P>Of all the other classes, this seems to be that which the
least contributes to furnish out the pleasures or supply the
necessities of man. The falcon hunts for him; the poultry tribe supplies
him with luxurious food; and the little sparrow race delight him with the
melody of their warblings. The crane kind make a studied variety in his
entertainments; and the class of ducks are not only many of them delicate in
their flesh, but extremely useful for their feathers. But in the class of
the pie kind there are few except the pidgeon that are any way useful. They
serve rather to teize man than to assist or amuse him. Like
faithless servants, they are fond of his neighbourhood, because they
mostly live by his labour; but their chief study is what they can plunder
in his absence, while their deaths make him no atonement for their
depredation.</P>
<P>But though, with respect to man, this whole class is rather
noxious than beneficial; though he may consider them in this light, as
false, noisy, troublesome neighbours, yet, with re∣spect to each other,
no class of birds are so in∣genious, so active, or so well fitted for
society. Could we suppose a kind of morality among <PB N="221" REF="242"/>
birds, we should find that these are by far the most industrious, the
most faithful, the most constant, and the most connubial. The rapacious
kinds drive out their young before they are fit to struggle with adversity;
but the pie kind cherish their young to the last. The poultry class are
faithless and promiscuous in their courtship; but these live in pairs,
and their attachments are wholly confined to each other. The sparrow kind
frequently overleap the bounds of Nature and make illicit varieties; but
these never. They live in harmony with each other; every species is true to
its kind, and transmits an unpolluted race to posterity.</P>
<P>As other kinds build in rocks or upon the ground, the chief
place where these build is in trees or bushes; the male takes his share
in the labours of building the nest; and often relieves his mate in the
duties of incubation. Both take this office by turns; and when the young are
excluded, both are equally active in making them an ample provision.</P>
<P>They sometimes live in societies; and in these there are
general laws observed, and a kind of republican form of government
established among them. They watch not only for the general safety, but
for that of every other bird of the grove. How often have we seen a fowler, 
<PB N="222" REF="243"/> stealing in upon a flock of ducks or wild geese,
disturbed by the alarming note of a crow or a magpie: its single voice gave
the whole thought∣less tribe warning, and taught them in good time to look to
their safety.</P>
<P>Nor are these birds less remarkable for their instincts
than their capacity for instruction. There is an apparent cunning or
archness in the look of the whole tribe; and I have seen crows and ravens
taught to fetch and carry with the docility of a spaniel. Indeed, it is often
an exercise that without teaching all this tribe are but too fond of. Every
body knows what a passion they have for shining substances and such
toys as some of us put a value upon. A whole family has been alarmed at the
loss of a ring; every servant has been accused, and every creature in the
house, conscious of their own in∣nocence, suspected each other, when,
to the utter surprize of all, it has been found in the nest of a tame
magpie or a jack-daw that no∣body had ever thought of.</P>
<P>However, as this class is very numerous, it is not to be
supposed that the manners are alike in all. Some, such as the pidgeon,
are gentle and serviceable to man; others are noxious, capricious, and
noisy. In a few ge∣neral characters they all agree; namely, in 
<PB N="223" REF="244"/> having hoarse voices, slight active bodies, and a
facility of flight, that baffles even the boldest of the rapacious kinds in
the pursuit. I will begin with those birds which most properly may be
said to belong to this class, and go on till I finish with the pidgeon,
an harmless bird, that resembles this tribe in little else except their
size, and that seems to be the shade uniting the pie and the sparrow
kind into one general picture.</P>
<P>It is not to be expected that in this sketch of the great
magazine of Nature we can stop singly to contemplate every object. To
describe the number that offers would be tedious, and the similitude that
one bears another would make the history disgusting. As an historian in
re∣lating the actions of some noble people does not stop to give the
character of every private man in the army, but only of such as have been
di∣stinguished by their conduct, courage, or treachery; so should the
historian of Nature only seize upon the most striking objects before
him; and, having given one common account of the most remarkable, refer the
peculiarities of the rest to their general description.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="224" REF="245"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. II. Of the Raven, the Crow, and their
Affinities.</HEAD>
<P>THE raven, the carrion-crow, and the rook, are birds so well
known, that a long description would but obscure our ideas of them. The
raven is the largest of the three, and distin∣guished from the rest not
only by his size, but by his bill being somewhat more hooked than that of
the rest. As for the carrion-crow and the rook, they so strongly
resemble each other, both in make and size, that they are not easily
distinguished asunder. The chief difference to be found between them lies
in the bill of the rook; which, by frequently being thrust into the ground to
fetch out grubs and earth-worms, is bare of feathers as far as the eyes, and
appears of a whitish colour. It differs also in the purple splendour or
gloss of its feathers, which in the carrion-crow are of a more dirty black.
Nor is it amiss to make these distinctions, as the rook has but too
frequently suffered for its simi∣tude to the carrion-crow; and thus an
harmless bird, that feeds only upon insects and corn, has been destroyed
for another that feeds upon car∣rion, and is often destructive among young
poultry.</P>
<P><PB N="225" REF="246"/>The manners of the raven and the
carrion-crow are exactly similar; they both feed upon carrion; they fly only
in pairs; and will destroy other birds if they can take them by surprize.
But it is very different with the rook, the daw, and the Cornish chough,
which may be all ranked in this order. They are sociable and harmless; they
live only upon insects and grain; and wherever they are, instead of
injuring other birds, they seem centinels for the whole feathered creation.
It will be proper, therefore, to describe these two sorts according to
their re∣spective appetites, as they have nothing in com∣mon but the very
strong similitude they bear to each other in their colour and
formation.</P>
<P>The raven is a bird found in every region of the world: strong
and hardy, he is uninfluenced by the changes of the weather; and when other
birds seem numbed with cold, or pining with famine, the raven is active and
healthy, busily employed in prowling for prey, or sporting in the coldest
atmosphere. As the heats at the line do not oppress him, so he bears the
cold of the polar countries with equal indifference. He is sometimes indeed
seen milk white; and this may probably be the effect of the rigorous
cli∣mates of the north. It is most likely that this change is wrought upon
him as upon most other <PB N="226" REF="247"/> animals in that part of the
world, where their robes, particularly in winter, assume the colour of the
country they inhabit. As in old age, when the natural heat decays, the hair
grows grey, and at last white, so among these animals the cold of the
climate may produce a similar languishment of colour, and may shut up
those pores that conveyed the tincturing fluids to the extremest parts of
the body.</P>
<P>However this may be, white ravens are often shown among us,
which, I have heard some say, are rendered thus by art; and this we could
rea∣dily suppose if they were as easily changed in their colour as they
are altered in their habits and dispositions. A raven may be reclaimed to
al∣most every purpose to which birds can be con∣verted. He may be trained
up for fowling like an hawk; he may be taught to fetch and carry like a
spaniel; he may be taught to speak like a parrot; but the most
extraordinary of all is, that he can be taught to sing like a man. I have
heard a raven sing the Black Joke with great distinctness, truth, and
humour.</P>
<P>Indeed, when the raven is taken as a domestic, he has many
qualities that render him extremely amusing. Busy, inquisitive, and
impudent, he goes every where, affronts and drives off the dogs, plays his
pranks on the poultry, and is <PB N="227" REF="248"/> particularly assiduous
in cultivating the good will of the cook-maid, who seems to be the fa∣vourite
of the family. But then, with the amus∣ing qualities of a favourite, he often
also has the vices and defects. He is a glutton by nature, and a thief by
habit. He does not confine him∣self to petty depredations on the pantry or
the larder; he soars at more magnificent plunder; at spoils that he can
neither exhibit nor enjoy; but which, like a miser, he rests satisfied
with having the satisfaction of sometimes visiting and contemplating in
secret. A piece of money, a tea-spoon, or a ring, are always tempting baits
to his avarice; these he will slily seize upon, and if not watched will
carry to his favourite hole.</P>
<P>In his wild state, the raven is an active and greedy
plunderer. Nothing comes amiss to him; whether his prey be living or long
dead it is all the same, he falls to with a voracious appe∣tite; and when he
has gorged himself, flies to acquaint his fellows that they may participate
of the spoil. If the carcase be already in the pos∣session of
some more powerful animal, a wolf, a fox, or a dog, the raven sits at a
little distance, content to continue an humble spectator till they have
done. If in his flights he perceives no hopes of carrion, and his scent is
so exquisite <PB N="228" REF="249"/> that he can smell it at a vast
distance, he then contents himself with more unsavory food, fruits,
insects, and the accidental desert of a dunghill.</P>
<P>This bird chiefly builds its nest in trees, and lays five or
six eggs of a pale green colour, marked with small brownish spots. They
live sometimes in pairs, and sometimes they fre∣quent in great numbers the
neighbourhood of populous cities, where they are useful in de∣vouring those
carcases that would otherwise pu∣trefy and infect the air. They build in
high trees or old towers, in the beginning of March with us in England, and
sometimes sooner, as the spring is more or less advanced for the
season. But it is not always near towns that they fix their retreats: they
often build in un∣frequented places, and drive all other birds from their
vicinity. They will not permit even their young to keep in the same
district, but drive them off when they are sufficiently able to shift for
themselves. Martin, in his description of the Western Isles, avers,
that there are three little islands among the number which are oc∣cupied by a
pair of ravens each, that drive off all other birds with great cries and
impetuosity.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the injury these birds do in picking out the
eyes of sheep and lambs, when <PB N="229" REF="250"/> they find them sick
and helpless, a vulgar re∣spect is paid them as being the birds that fed
the prophet Elijah in the wilderness. This prepossession in favour of
the raven is of very ancient date, as the Romans themselves, who thought the
bird ominous, paid it from motives of fear the most profound veneration. One
of these that had been kept in the temple of Castor, as Pliny informs us,
flew down into the shop of a taylor, who took much delight in the visits of
his new acquaintance. He taught the bird se∣veral tricks; but particularly to
pronounce the names of the emperor Tiberius and the whole royal family. The
taylor was beginning to grow rich by those who came to see this won∣derful
raven, till an envious neighbour, dis∣pleased at the taylor's success,
killed the bird, and deprived the taylor of his future hopes of fortune. The
Romans, however, took the poor taylor's part; they punished the man who
of∣fered the injury, and gave the raven all the ho∣nours of a magnificent
interment.</P>
<P>Birds in general live longer than quadru∣pedes; and the raven is
said to be one of the most long-lived of the number. Hesiod asserts
that a raven will live nine times as long as a man; but though this is
fabulous, it is certain that some of them have been known to live near 
<PB N="230" REF="251"/> an hundred years. This animal seems possessed
of those qualities that generally produce lon∣gevity, a good appetite and
great exercise. In clear weather, the ravens fly in pairs to a great height,
making a deep loud noise, different from that of their usual croaking.</P>
<P>The carrion-crow resembles the raven in its appetites, its
laying, and manner of bringing up its young. It only differs in being less
bold, less docile, and less favoured by mankind.</P>
<P>The rook leads the way in another, but a more harmless train,
that have no carnivorous appetites, but only feed upon insects and corn. The
royston crow is about the size of the two former. The breast, belly,
back, and upper part of the neck, being of a pale ash-colour; the head and
wings glossed over with a fine blue. He is a bird of passage,
visiting this kingdom in the beginning of winter and leaving it in the
spring. He breeds, however, in different parts of the British dominions;
and his nest is com∣mon enough in trees in Ireland. The jack-daw is black,
like all the former, but ash-coloured on the breast and belly. He is not
above the size of a pigeon. He is docile and loquacious. His head being large
for the size of his body, which, as has been remarked, argues him in∣genious
and crafty. He builds in steeples, old <PB N="231" REF="252"/> castles, and
high rocks, laying five or six eggs in a season. The Cornish chough is
like a jack-daw, but bigger, and almost the size of a crow. The feet and
legs are long like those of a jack-daw, but of a red colour; and the plumage
is black all over. It frequents rocks, old castles, and churches, by the
sea-side, like the daw; and with the same noisy assiduity. It is
only seen along the western coasts of England. These are birds very
similar in their manners, feeding on grain and insects, living in
society, and often suffering general castigation from the flock for the
good of the community.</P>
<P>The rook, as is well known, builds in woods and forests in the
neighbourhood of man, and sometimes makes choice of groves in the very
midst of cities for the place of its retreat and se∣curity. In these it
establishes a kind of legal constitution, by which all intruders are
excluded from coming to live among them, and none suffered to build but
acknowledged natives of the place. I have often amused myself with
ob∣serving their plan of policy from my window in the Temple, that looks upon
a grove where they have made a colony in the midst of the city. At the
commencement of spring, the rookery, which during the continuance of winter
seemed to have been deserted, or only <PB N="232" REF="253"/> guarded by
about five or six, like old soldiers in a garrison, now begins to be once
more fre∣quented; and in a short time all the bustle and hurry of
business is fairly commenced. Where these numbers resided during the
winter is not easy to guess; perhaps in the trees of hedge-rows to be
nearer their food. In spring, however, they cultivate their native trees;
and, in the places where they were themselves hatched, they pre∣pare to
propagate a future progeny.</P>
<P>They keep together in pairs; and when the offices of courtship
are over, they prepare for making their nests and laying. The old
inha∣bitants of the place are all already provided; the nest which served
them for years before, with a little trimming and dressing will serve
very well again; the difficulty of nestling lies only upon the young ones who
have no nest, and must therefore get up one as well as they can. But not
only the materials are wanting, but also the place in which to fix it. Every
part of a tree will not do for this purpose, as some branches may not be
sufficiently forked; others may not be sufficiently strong; and still
others may be too much exposed to the rockings of the wind. The male and
female upon this occasion are, for some days, seen examining all the
trees of the grove very attentively; and <PB N="233" REF="254"/> when they have
fixed upon a branch that seems fit for their purpose, they continue to fit
upon and observe it very sedulously for two or three days longer. The
place being thus deter∣mined upon, they begin to gather the materials for their
nest; such as sticks and fibrous roots, which they regularly dispose
in the most sub∣stantial manner. But here a new and unex∣pected
obstacle arises. It often happens that the young couple have made choice of
a place too near the mansion of an older pair, who do not chuse to be
incommoded by such trouble∣some neighbours. A quarrel therefore instantly
ensues; in which the old ones are always vic∣torious.</P>
<P>The young couple, thus expelled, are obliged again to go through
the fatigues of deliberating, examining, and chusing; and having taken care
to keep their due distance, the nest begins again, and their industry
deserves commenda∣tion. But their alacrity is often too great in the
beginning; they soon grow weary of bringing the materials of their nest
from distant places; and they very easily perceive that sticks may be be
provided nearer home, with less honesty in∣deed, but some degree of
address. Away they go, therefore, to pilfer as fast as they can; and
wherever they see a nest unguarded, they take care to rob it of the very
choicest sticks of <PB N="234" REF="255"/> which it is composed. But
these thefts never go unpunished; and probably upon complaint being made
there is a general punishment in∣flicted. I have seen eight or ten rooks
come upon such occasions, and setting upon the new nest of the young
couple all at once, tear it in pieces in a moment.</P>
<P>At length, therefore, the young pair find the necessity of
going more regularly and honestly to work. While one flies to fetch the
materials, the other sits upon the tree to guard it; and thus in the space
of three or four days, with a skirmish now and then between, the pair have
fitted up a commodious nest composed of sticks without, and of fibrous
roots and long grass within. From the instant the female begins to lay, all
hostilities are at an end; not one of the whole grove, that a little before
treated her so rudely, will now venture to molest her; so that she
brings forth her brood with patient tranqui∣lity. Such is the severity with
which even na∣tive rooks are treated by each other; but if a foreign rook
should attempt to make himself a denizen of their society, he would meet
with no favour; the whole grove would at once be up in arms against him, and
expel him without mercy.</P>
<P>In some countries these birds are considered as a benefit,
in others as a nuisance: their chief <PB N="235" REF="256"/> food is the worm
of the dorbeetle and corn; thus they may be said to do as much service by
destroying that noxious insect, as they do injury by consuming the
produce of the hus∣bandman's industry.</P>
<P>To this tribe of the crow-kind, some foreign sorts might be
added: I will take notice only of one, which from the extraordinary size and
fashion of its bill must not be passed in silence. This is the Calao,
or horned Indian raven, which exceeds the common raven in size, and habits of
depre∣dation. But what he differs in from all other birds is the beak, which,
by its length and cur∣vature at the end, appears designed for rapine; but
then it has a kind of horn standing out from the top, which looks somewhat
like a second bill, and gives this bird, otherwise fierce and ugly, a very
formidable appearance. The horn springs out of the forehead, and grows to the
upper part of the bill, being of great bulk; so that near the forehead it is
four inches broad, not unlike the horn of the rhinoceros, but more crooked at
the tip. Were the body of the bird answerable in size to the head, the
calao would exceed in magnitude even the vulture or the eagle. But the head and
beak are out of all proportion, the body being not much larger than that of a
hen. Yet even here there are varieties; for in such of those birds as come 
<PB N="236" REF="257"/> from different parts of Africa, the body is
pro∣portionable to the beak; in such as come from the Molucca Islands, the
beak bears no pro∣portion to the body. Of what use this extra∣ordinary
excrescence is to the bird is not easy to determine; it lives, like others
of its kind, upon carrion, and seldom has a living enemy to cope with: Nature
seems to sport in the pro∣duction of many animals, as if she were willing
to exhibit instances as well of variety as oeco∣nomy in their formation.</P>

<PB N="237" REF="258"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. III. Of the Magpie and its Affinities.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are such a variety of birds that may be distributed
under this head, that we must not expect very precise ideas of any. To have
a straight strong bill, legs formed for hopping, a body of about the size
of a magpie, and party coloured plumage, are the only marks by which I must
be contented to distinguish this nume∣rous phantastic tribe, that add to
the beauty, though not to the harmony of our landscapes. In fact, their
chattering every where disturbs the melody of the lesser warblers; and
their noisy courtship not a little damps the song of the linnet and the
nightingale.</P>
<P>However, we have very few of this kind in our woods compared to
those in the neighbourhood of the line. There they not only paint the scene
with the beauty and the variety of their plumage, but stun the ear with their
vociferation. In those luxurious forests, the singing birds are scarce
ever heard, but a hundred varieties of the pie, the jay, the roller, the
chatterer and the toucan, are continually in motion, and with their illusive
mockeries disturb or divert the spectator, as he happens to be
disposed.</P>
<P><PB N="238" REF="259"/>The magpie is the chief of this kind with
us, and is too well known to need a description. Indeed, were its other
accomplishments equal to its beauty, few birds could be put in com∣petition.
Its black, its white, its green and purple, with the rich and gilded
combination of the glosses on its tail, are as fine as any that adorn the
most beautiful of the fea∣thered tribe. But it has too many of the qua∣lities
of a beau, to depreciate these natural perfections: vain, restless, loud,
and quarrel∣some, it is an unwelcome intruder every where; and never
misses an opportunity, when it finds one, of doing mischief.</P>
<P>The magpie bears a great resemblance to the butcher-bird in
its bill, which has a sharp pro∣cess near the end of the upper chap, as
well as in the shortness of its wings, and the form of the tail, each
feather shortening from the two middlemost. But it agrees still more in
its food, living not only upon worms and insects, but also upon small
birds when they can be seized. A wounded lark, or a young chicken separated
from the hen, are sure plunder; and the magpie will even sometimes set
upon and strike a black-bird.</P>
<P>The same insolence prompts it to teize the largest animals
when its insults can be offered <PB N="239" REF="260"/> with security. They
often are seen perched upon the back of an ox or a sheep, pecking up the
insects to be found there, chattering and tormenting the poor animal at the
same time, and stretching out their necks for combat, if the beast turns
its head backward to reprehend them. They seek out also the nests of
birds; and, if the parent escapes, the eggs make up for the deficiency: the
thrush and the black-bird are but too frequently robbed by this
assassin, and this in some measure causes their scarcity.</P>
<P>No food seems to come amiss to this bird; it shares with
ravens in their carrion, with rooks in their grain, and with the cuckoo in
bird's eggs: but it seems possessed of a providence seldom usual
with gluttons; for when it is satisfied for the present, it lays up the
remainder of the feast for another occasion. It will even in a tame state
hide its food when it has done eating, and after a time return to the secret
hoard with renewed appetite and vociferation.</P>
<P>In all its habits it discovers a degree of in∣stinct
unusual to other birds. Its nest is not less remarkable for the manner in
which it is composed than for the place the magpie takes to build it in. The
nest is usually placed con∣spicuous enough, either in the middle of
some <PB N="240" REF="261"/> hawthorn bush, or on the top of some high
tree. The place, however, is always found difficult of access; for the tree
pitched upon usually grows in some thick hedge-row, fenced by brambles at
the root; or sometimes one of the higher bushes is fixed upon for the
purpose. When the place is thus chosen as inaccessible as possible
to men, the next care is to fence the nest above so as to defend it from
all the va∣rious enemies of air. The kite, the crow, and the sparrow-hawk,
are to be guarded against; as their nests have been sometimes plundered
by the magpie, so it is reasonably feared that they will take the first
opportunity to retaliate. To prevent this, the magpie's nest is built with
surprizing labour and ingenuity.</P>
<P>The body of the nest is composed of hawthorn branches; the
thorns sticking outward, but well united together by their mutual
insertions. Within it is lined with fibrous roots, wool, and long grass,
and then nicely plaistered all round with mud and clay. The body of the
nest being thus made firm and commodious, the next work is to make the canopy
which is to defend it above. This is composed of the sharpest thorns,
wove together in such a manner as to deny all entrance except at the door,
which is just large enough to permit egress and <PB N="241" REF="262"/>
regress to the owners. In this fortress the male and female hatch and bring
up their brood with security, sheltered from all attacks but those of the
climbing school-boy, who often finds his torn and bloody hands too dear a
price for the eggs or the young ones. The magpie lays six or seven eggs, of
a pale green colour, spotted with brown.</P>
<P>This bird, in its domestic state, preserves its natural
character with strict propriety. The same noisy, mischievous habits
attend it to the cage that marked it in the woods; and being more cunning, so
it is also a more docile bird than any other taken into keeping. Those who
are desirous of teaching it to speak, have a foolish custom of cutting
its tongue, which only puts the poor animal to pain, without improving its
speech in the smallest degree. Its speaking is sometimes very
distinct; but its sounds are too thin and sharp to be an exact imitation
of the human voice, which the hoarse raven and parrot can counterfeit more
exactly.</P>
<P>To this tribe we may refer the Jay, which is one of the most
beautiful of the British birds. The forehead is white, streaked with black;
the head is covered with very long feathers, which it can erect into a crest
at pleasure; the whole neck, back, breast and belly, are of a 
<PB N="242" REF="263"/> faint purple, dashed with grey; the wings are most
beautifully barred with a lovely blue, black and white; the tail is black, and
the feet of a pale brown. Like the magpie, it feeds upon fruits, will kill
small birds, and is extremely docile.</P>
<P>The Chatterer also, which is a native of Germany, may be
placed in this rank; and is somewhat less than the former. It is variegated
with a beautiful mixture of colours; red, ash∣colour, chesnut and yellow:
but what distin∣guishes it from all other birds, are the horny appendages
from the tips of seven of the lesser quill feathers, which stand bare
of beards, and have the colour and gloss of the best red sealing∣wax.</P>
<P>The Roller is not less beautiful than any of the former. The
breast and belly are blue; the head green; and the wings variegated with
blue, black and white. But it may be distin∣guished from all others by a
sort of naked tu∣bercles or warts near the eyes, which still far∣ther
contribute to encrease its beauty.</P>
<P>To this class may be added a numerous list from all the
tropical forests of the east and west; where the birds are remarkable for
discordant voices and brilliant plumage. I will fix only upon one, which is
the most singular of all the <PB N="243" REF="264"/> feathered creation.
This is the Toucan, a bird of the pie kind, whose bill is nearly as large as
the rest of its whole body.</P>
<P>Of this extraordinary bird there are four or five varieties. I
will only describe the red beaked toucan; and as the figure of this bird
makes the principal part of its history, I will follow Edwards through all
the minutiae of its singular conformation. It is about the size of and
shaped like a jack-daw, with a large head to support its monstrous bill:
this bill, from the angles of the mouth to its point, is six inches and an
half; and its breadth, in the thickest part, is a little more than two. Its
thickness near the head, is one inch and a quarter; and it is a little
rounded along the top of the upper chap, the under side being round also;
the whole of the bill extremely slight and a little thicker than parchment.
The upper chap is of a bright yellow, except on each side, which is of a fine
scarlet colour; as is also the lower chap, except at the base, which is
purple. Between the head and the bill there is a black line of separation all
round the base of the bill; in the upper part of which the nostrils are
placed, and are almost covered with feathers; which has occasioned some
writers to say, that <PB N="244" REF="265"/> the toucan has no nostrils.
Round the eyes, on each side of the head, is a space of bluish skin,
void of feathers, above which the head is black, except a white spot on each
side joining to the base of the upper chap. The hinder part of the neck,
the back, wings, tail, belly and thighs, are black. The under side of the
head, throat, and the beginning of the breast, are white. Between the white
on the breast, and the black on the belly, is a space of red feathers, in
the form of a new moon, with its horns up∣wards. The legs, feet and claws, are
of an ash-colour; and the toes stand like those of parrots, two before,
and two behind.</P>
<P>It is reported, by travellers, that this bird, though
furnished with so formidable a beak, is harmless and gentle, being so
easily made tame, as to sit and hatch its young in houses. It feeds
chiefly upon pepper, which it devours very greedily, gorging itself in such
a manner, that it voids it crude and unconcocted. This, however, is no
objection to the natives from using it again; they even prefer it before that
pepper which is fresh gathered from the tree: and seem persuaded that the
strength and heat of the pepper is qualified by the bird, and that all its
noxious qualities are thus exhausted.</P>
<P><PB N="245" REF="266"/>Whatever be the truth of this report,
nothing is more certain than that the toucan lives only upon a vegetable diet;
and in a domestic state, to which it is frequently brought in the warm
countries where it is bred, it is seen to prefer such food to all other.
Pozzo, who bred one tame, asserts, that it leaped up and down, wagged the
tail, and cried with a voice re∣sembling that of a magpie. It fed upon the
same things that parrots do; but was most greedy of grapes, which, being
plucked off one by one, and thrown in the air, it would most dexterously
catch before they fell to the ground. Its bill, he adds, was hollow, and upon
that account very light, so that it had but little strength in so
apparently formidable a weapon; nor could it peck or strike smartly
therewith. But its tongue seemed to assist the efforts of this unwieldy
machine: it was long, thin and flat, not unlike one of the feathers on the neck
of a dunghill cock; this it moved up and down, and often extended five or six
inches from the bill. It was of a flesh colour, and very remarkably fringed
on each side with very small filaments, exactly resembling a feather.</P>
<P>It is probable that this long tongue has greater strength than
the thin hollow beak that <PB N="246" REF="267"/> contains it. It is likely that
the beak is only a kind of sheath for this peculiar instru∣ment, used by
the toucan, not only in making itself a nest, but also in obtaining its
provision. Nothing is more certain, than that this bird builds its nest in
holes of trees, which have been previously scooped out for this purpose;
and it is not very likely that so feeble a bill could be very serviceable
in working upon such hard materials.</P>
<P>Be this as it will, there is no bird secures its young better
from external injury than the toucan. It has not only birds, men, and
ser∣pents to guard against, but a numerous tribe of monkies, still more
prying, mischievous and hungry than all the rest. The toucan, how∣ever,
scoops out its nest into the hollow of some tree, leaving only a hole
large enough to go in and out at. There it sits, with its great beak,
guarding the entrance; and if the monkey ventures to offer a visit of
curiosity, the toucan gives him such a welcome, that he presently thinks
proper to pack off, and is glad to escape with safety.</P>
<P>This bird is only found in the warm climates of South America,
where it is in great request, both for the delicacy of its flesh, which is
tender <PB N="247" REF="268"/> and nourishing, and for the beauty of its
plu∣mage, particularly the feathers of the breast. The skin of this part
the Indians pluck off, and, when dry, glue to their cheeks; and this they
consider as an irresistible addition to their beauty.</P>

<PB N="248" REF="269"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. IV. Of the Wood-pecker and its Affinities.</HEAD>
<P>WE come now to the numerous tribe of Wood-peckers; a class
easily distinguishable from all others, both for their peculiar
forma∣tion, their method of procuring food, and their manner of providing a
place of safety for their young. Indeed, no other class of birds seems
more immediately formed for the method of life they pursue, being fitted by
nature, at all points, for the peculiarity of their con∣dition. They live
chiefly upon the insects contained in the body of trees; and for this
purpose are furnished with a straight, hard, strong, angular and
sharp bill, made for pierc∣ing and boring. They have a tongue of a very great
length; round, ending in a sharp, stiff, bony thorn, dentated on each
side, to strike ants and insects when dislodged from their cells. Their
legs are short and strong, for the pur∣poses of climbing. Their toes
stand two forward, and two backward; which is parti∣cularly serviceable in
holding by branches of trees. They have hard stiff tails, to lean upon when
climbing. They feed only upon insects, <PB N="249" REF="270"/> and want that
intestine, which anatomists call the caecum; a circumstance peculiar to
this tribe only.</P>
<P>Of this bird there are many kinds, and many varieties in each
kind. They form large colo∣nies in the forests of every part of the world.
They differ in size, colour, and appearance; and agree only in the marks
above-mentioned, or in those habits which result from so peculiar a
conformation. Instead, therefore, of de∣scending into a minute
discrimination of every species, let us take one for a pattern, to which
all the rest will be found to bear the strongest affinity. Words can but
feebly describe the plumage of a bird; but it is the province of history to
enter into a detail of every animal's pursuits and occupations.</P>
<P>The Green Wood-spite or Wood-pecker is called the Rain-Fowl in
some parts of the coun∣try; because, when it makes a greater noise than
ordinary, it is supposed to foretell rain. It is about the size of a jay;
the throat, breast and belly are of a pale greenish colour; and the back,
neck and covert feathers of the wings are green. But the tongue of this little
animal makes its most distinguished characteristic, as it serves for
its support and defence. As was said above, the wood-pecker feeds upon
insects; and parti∣cularly <PB N="250" REF="271"/> on those which are lodged
in the body of hollow or of rotting trees. The tongue is its instrument for
killing and procuring this food; which cannot be found in great plenty. This is
round, ending in a stiff, sharp, bony tip, dentated on both sides, like
the beard of an arrow; and this it can dart out three or four inches from the
bill, and draw in again at pleasure. Its prey is thus transfixed, and drawn
into the bill, which, when swallowed, the dart is again launched at fresh
game. Nothing has employed the attention of the curious in this part of
anatomy, more than the contrivance by which the tongue of this bird performs
its functions with such great celerity. The tongue is drawn back into the
bill by the help of two small round cartilages, fastened into the fore
mentioned bony tip, and running along the length of the tongue. These
cartilages, from the root of the tongue, take a circuit beyond the ears; and
being reflected backwards to the crown of the head, make a large bow. The
muscular, spongy flesh of the tongue, encloses these cartilages, like
a sheath; and is so made, that it may be extended or contracted like a
worm. The cartilages indeed have muscles accompanying them along their whole
length backwards. But there is still another con∣trivance; 
<PB N="251" REF="272"/> for there is a broad muscle, joining the cartilages to
the bones of the skull, which, by contracting or dilating, forces the
cartilages forward through the tongue, and then forces the tongue and all
through the bill, to be employed for the animal's preservation, in piercing
its prey.</P>
<P>Such is the instrument with which this bird is provided; and
this is the manner in which this instrument is employed. When a wood-pecker,
by its natural sagacity, finds out a rotten hollow tree, where there are
worms, ant's eggs, or insects, it immediately prepares for its operations.
Resting by its strong claws, and leaning on the thick feathers of its tail,
it begins to bore with its sharp strong beak, until it discloses the
whole internal habitation. Upon this, either through pleasure at the sight
of its prey, or with a desire to alarm the insect colony, it sends forth
a loud cry, which throws terror and confusion into the whole insect tribe.
They creep hither and thither, seeking for safety; while the bird
luxuriously feasts upon them at leisure, darting its tongue with unerring
cer∣tainty, and devouring the whole brood.</P>
<P>The wood-pecker, however, does not con∣fine its depredations
solely to trees, but some∣times lights upon the ground, to try its for∣tune
<PB N="252" REF="273"/> tune at an ant-hill. It is not so secure of prey
there as in the former case, although the num∣bers are much greater. They lie
generally too deep for the bird to come at them; and it is obliged to make up
by stratagem the defect of power. The wood-pecker first goes to their
hills, which it pecks, in order to call them abroad; it then thrusts out its
long red tongue, which being like a worm, and resembling their usual prey,
the ants come out to settle upon in great numbers; however, the bird watching
the properest opportunity, withdraws its tongue at a jerk, and devours the
devourers. This stra∣tagem it continues till it has alarmed their fears; or
till it is quite satisfied.</P>
<P>As the wood pecker is obliged to make holes in trees to procure
food, so is it also to make cavities still larger to form its nest and
to lay in. This is performed, as usual, with the bill; although some have
affirmed that the animal uses its tongue, as a gimblet, to bore with. But
this is a mistake; and those that are curious, may often hear the noise
of the bill making its way in large woods and forests. The wood-pecker
chuses, however, for this purpose, trees that are decayed, or wood that is
soft, like beech, elm and poplar. In these, with very little trouble, it
can make holes as exactly round <PB REF="274"/>

</FIGURE> <PB N="253" REF="275"/> as a mathematician could with
compasses. One of these holes the bird generally chuses for its own
use, to nestle, and bring up its young in: but as they are easily made,
it is delicate in its choice, and often makes twenty before one is found fit to
give entire satisfaction. Of those which it has made and deserted, other
birds, not so good borers, and less delicate in their choice, take
possession. The jay and the starling lay their eggs in these holes;
and bats are now and then found in peaceable possession. Boys
sometimes have thrust in their hands with certain hopes of plucking out a
bird's egg; but, to their great mortification have had their fingers bitten by
a bat at the bottom.</P>
<P>The wood-pecker takes no care to line its nest with feathers
or straw; its eggs are depo∣sited in the hole, without any thing to keep
them warm, except the heat of the parent's body. Their number is generally five
or six; always white, oblong, and of a middle size. When the young are
excluded, and before they leave the nest, they are adorned with a scarlet
plu∣mage under the throat, which adds to their beauty.</P>
<P>In our climate, this bird is contented with such a wainscot
habitation as has been described for its young; but in the warmer regions of 
<PB REF="276"/> <GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/> 
<PB N="253" REF="277"/> <GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/> 
<PB N="254" REF="278"/> Guinea and Brasil, they take a very different method
to protect and hatch their nascent progeny. A traveller who walks into the
forests of those countries, among the first strange objects that excite
curiosity, is struck with the multitude of bird's-nests hanging at the
extremity of almost every branch. Many other kind of birds build in this
manner; but the chief of them are of the wood-pecker kind: and indeed, there is
not, in the whole history of nature, a more singular instance of the
sagacity of those little animals in protecting themselves against
such enemies as they have most occasion to fear. In cultivated countries,
a great part of the caution of the feathered tribe is to hide or defend their
nests from the invasions of man, as he is their most dreaded enemy. But
in the depth of those remote and solitary forests, where man is but
seldom seen, the little bird has nothing to apprehend from man. The parent
is careless how much the nest is exposed to general notice; satisfied
if it be out of the reach of those rapa∣cious creatures that live by robbery
and surprize. If the monkey or the snake can be guarded against, the bird
has no other enemies to fear: for this purpose, its nest is built upon the
depend∣ing points of the most outward branches of a tall tree, such as the
banana or the plantane. On <PB N="255" REF="279"/> one of those immense
trees, is seen the most various, and the most inimical assemblage of
creatures that can be imagined. The top is in∣habited by monkies of some
particular tribe, that drive off all others; lower down twine about the great
trunk numbers of the larger snakes, patiently waiting till some unwary
ani∣mal comes within the sphere of their activity; and at the edges of the
tree hang these artificial nests, in great abundance, inhabited by birds of
the most delightful plumage.</P>
<P>The nest is usually formed in this manner: When the time of
incubation approaches, they fly busily about, in quest of a kind of moss,
called, by the English inhabitants of those countries, <HI>old man's
beard.</HI> It is a fibrous sub∣stance, and not very unlike hair, which
bears being moulded into any form, and suffers being glued together. This,
therefore, the little wood-pecker, called by the natives of Brasil, the
Guiratemga, first glues by some viscous sub∣stance, gathered in the
forest, to the extremest branch of a tree; then building downward, and
still adding fresh materials to those already procured, a nest is
formed, that depends, like a pouch, from the point of the branch: the hole to
enter at, is on the side; and all the interior parts are lined with the finer
fibres of the same substance, which compose the whole.</P>
<P><PB N="256" REF="280"/>Such is the general contrivance of these
hang∣ing nests; which are made, by some other birds, with still
superior art. A little bird of the Gros∣beak kind, in the Philippine
islands, makes its nest in such a manner that there is no opening but
from the bottom. At the bottom the bird enters, and goes up through a funnel,
like a chimney, till it comes to the real door of the nest, which lies on one
side, and only opens into this funnel.</P>
<P>Some birds glue their nest to the leaf of the banana-tree,
which makes two sides of their little habitation; while the other two are
ar∣tificially composed by their own industry. But these, and all of the
kind, are built with the same precautions to guard the young against the
depredations of monkies and serpents, which abound in every tree. The nest
hangs there, before the spoilers, a tempting object, which they can only gaze
upon, while the bird flies in and out, without danger or molestation, from
so formidable a vicinity.</P>

<P><PB N="257" REF="282"/> THERE are few birds that have more
de∣ceived and puzzled the learned than this. Some have described it as an
inhabitant of the air, living only upon the dew of heaven, and never resting
below; others have acquiesced in the latter part of its history, but have
given it flying insects to feed on. Some have asserted that it was
without feet, and others have ranked it among the birds of prey.</P>
<P>The great beauty of this bird's plumage, and the deformity of
its legs, seem to have given rise to most of these erroneous reports.
The native savages of the Molucca Islands, of which it is an inhabitant,
were very little studious of natu∣ral history; and, perceiving the
inclination the Europeans had for this beautiful bird, carefully cut off its
legs before they brought it to market; thus concealing its greatest
deformity, they considered themselves entitled to rise in their demands
when they offered it for sale. One deceit led on to another; the buyer
finding the bird without legs, naturally enquired after them; and the seller
as naturally began to assert that it <PB REF="283"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/> <PB N="257" REF="284"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/> <PB N="258" REF="285"/> had
none. Thus far the European was imposed upon by others; in all the rest he
imposed upon himself. Seeing so beautiful a bird without legs, he
concluded that it could live only in air, where legs were unnecessary. The
extraordi∣nary splendour of its plumage assisted this de∣ception; and
as it had heavenly beauty, so it was asserted to have an heavenly
residence. From thence its name, and all the false reports that have been
propagated concerning it.</P>
<P>Error, however, is short-lived; and time has discovered that
this bird not only has legs, but very large strong ones for its size.
Credulity when undeceived runs into the opposite ex∣treme; and soon after
this harmless bird was branded with the character of being rapacious, of
destroying all those of smaller size, and, from the amazing rapidity of
its flight, as qualified peculiarly for extensive rapine. The real history
of this pretty animal is at present tolerably well known; and it is found to
be as harmless as it is beautiful.</P>
<P>There are two kinds of the bird of Paradise; one about the
size of a pigeon, which is more common; the other not much larger than a
lark, which has been described more imper∣fectly. They are both
sufficiently distinguished from all other birds, not only by the
superior <PB N="259" REF="286"/> vivacity of their tints, but by the feathers
of the tail, there being two long slender filaments growing from the upper
part of the rump, these are longer than the bird's body, and bearded only at
the end. By this mark the bird of Paradise may be easily known, but still
more easily by its gaudy livery, which being so very brilliant, demands to
be minutely described.</P>
<P>This bird appears to the eye as large as a pigeon, though in
reality the body is not much greater than that of a thrush. The tail, which
is about six inches, is as long as the body; the wings are large compared
with the bird's other dimensions. The head, the throat and the neck are of a
pale gold colour. The base of the bill is surrounded by black feathers, as
also the side of the head and throat, as soft as velvet, and changeable
like those on the neck of a mallard. The hinder part of the head is of a
shining green, mixed with gold. The body and wings are chiefly covered with
beautiful brown, purple and gold feathers. The upper∣most part of the tail
feathers are of a pale yel∣low, and those under them white and longer than
the former; for which reason the hinder part of the tail appears to be all
white. But what chiefly excites curiosity are, the two long naked feathers
above-mentioned, which spring <PB N="260" REF="287"/> from the upper part of
the rump above the tail, and which are usually about three feet long. These
are bearded only at the beginning and the end; the whole shaft for above two
feet nine inches being of a deep black, while the fea∣thered extremity is of a
changeable colour, like the mallard's neck.</P>
<P>This bird, which for beauty exceeds all others of the pie kind,
is a native of the Molucca Islands, but found in greatest numbers in that
of Aro. There, in the delightful and spicy woods of the country, do these
beautiful crea∣tures fly in large flocks; so that the groves which produce
the richest spices produce the finest birds also. The inhabitants
themselves are not insensible of the pleasure these afford, and give
them the name of God's birds, as being superior to all others that he has
made. They live in large flocks, and at night generally perch upon the same
tree. They are called by some, the Swallows of Ternate, from their rapid
flight, and from their being continually on the wing in pursuit of insects,
their usual prey.</P>
<P>As the country where they are bred has its tempestuous
season, when rains and thunders continually disturb the atmosphere,
these birds are then but seldom seen. It is thought that 
<PB N="261" REF="288"/> they then fly to other countries where their food
appears in greater abundance; for, like swallows, they have their stated
times of return. In the beginning of the month of August, they are seen in
great numbers flying together; and, as the inhabitants would have us believe,
follow∣ing their king, who is distinguished from the rest by the lustre
of his plumage, and that re∣spect and veneration which is paid him. In the
evening they perch upon the highest trees of the forest, particularly one
which bears a red berry, upon which they sometimes feed, when other food
fails them. In what manner they breed, or what may be the number of their
young, as yet remains for discovery.</P>
<P>The natives, who make a trade of killing and selling these
birds to the Europeans, gene∣rally conceal themselves in the trees where they
resort, and having covered themselves up from sight in a bower made of
the branches, they shoot at the birds with reedy arrows; and, as they
assert, if they happen to kill the king, they then have a good chance for
killing the greatest part of the flock. The chief mark by which they know the
king is by the ends of the feathers in his tail, which have eyes like those
of a peacock. When they have taken a number <PB N="262" REF="289"/> of these
birds, their usual method is to gut them and cut off their legs; they then
run a hot iron into the body, which dries up the internal moisture; and
filling the cavity with salts and spices, they sell them to the Europeans
for a per∣fect trifle.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. The Cuckoo and its Varieties.</HEAD>
<P>FROM a bird of which many fables have been reported, we pass
to another that has not given less scope to fabulous invention. The note of
the cuckoo is known to all the world; the history and nature of the bird
itself still remains in great obscurity. That it devours its parent, that
it changes its nature with the season, and becomes a sparrow-hawk, were
fables invented of this bird, and are now suffi∣ciently refuted. But where it
resides in winter, or how it provides for its supply during that
season, still continues undiscovered.</P>
<P>This singular bird, which is somewhat less than a pigeon,
shaped like a magpie, and of a greyish colour, is distinguished from
all other birds, by its round prominent nostrils. Having disappeared all
the winter, it discovers itself in our country early in the spring, by
its well known call. Its note is heard earlier or later as the season
seems to be more or less forward, and the weather more or less inviting.
From the chearful voice of this bird the farmer may be instructed in the real
advancement of the year. <PB N="264" REF="291"/> The fallibility of human
calendars is but too well known; but from this bird's note the hus∣bandman
may be taught when to sow his most useful seeds, and do such work as
depends upon a certain temperature of the air. These fea∣thered guides come
to us heaven-taught, and point out the true commencement of the season.</P>
<P>The cuckoo, that was silent some time after its appearance,
begins at first feebly, and at very distant intervals, to give its call,
which, as the summer advances, improves both in its frequency and loudness.
This is an invitation to courtship, and used only by the male, who sits
generally perched upon some dead tree, or bare bough, and repeats his song,
which he loses as soon as the genial season is over. His note is
pleasant though uniform; and, from an association of ideas, seldom
occurs to the me∣mory without reminding us of the sweets of summer.
Custom too has affixed a more ludi∣crous association to this note; which,
however, we that are batchelors need be in no pain about. This reproach seems
to arise from this bird's making use of the bed or nest of another to
deposit its own brood in.</P>
<P>However this may be, nothing is more cer∣tain than that the
female makes no nest of her own. She repairs for that purpose to the nest
<PB N="265" REF="292"/> of some other bird, generally the water-wagtail or
hedge sparrow, and, having devoured the eggs of the owner, lays her own in
their place. She usually lays but one, which is speckled, and of the size
of a blackbird's. This the fond foolish bird hatches with great
assiduity, and, when excluded, finds no difference in the great ill-looking
changeling from her own. To supply this voracious creature, the credu∣lous
nurse toils with unusual labour, no way sensible that she is feeding
up an enemy to her race, and one of the most destructive robbers of her
future progeny.</P>
<P>It was once doubted whether these birds were carnivorous; but
Reaumur was at the pains of breeding up several, and found that they would
not feed upon bread or corn; but flesh and insects were their favourite
nourishment. He found it a very difficult task to teach them to peck; for
he was obliged to feed them for a full month, after they were grown as big as
the mother. Insects, however, seemed to be their peculiar food when young;
for they devoured flesh by a kind of constraint, as it was always put into
their mouths; but meal-worm insects they flew to, and swallowed of their
own ac∣cord most greedily. Indeed, their gluttony is not to be wondered at,
when we consider the <PB N="266" REF="293"/> capacity of their stomach,
which is enormous, and reaches from the breast-bone to the vent. It is partly
membranous, partly muscular, and of a prodigious capacity; yet still they
are not to be supposed as birds of prey, for they have neither the
strength nor the courage. On the contrary, they are naturally weak and
fearful, as appears by their flying from small birds which every where
pursue them. The young birds are brown mixed with black; and in that state
they have been described by some authors as old ones.</P>
<P>The cuckoo, when fledged and fitted for flight, follows its
supposed parent but for a little time; its appetites for insect food
encreas∣ing, as it finds no great chance for a supply in imitating its
little instructor, it parts good friends, the step-child seldom offering
any violence to its nurse. Nevertheless, all the little birds of the grove
seem to consider the young cuckoo as an enemy, and revenge the cause of
their kind by their repeated insults. They pursue it wherever it flies, and
oblige it to take shelter in the thickest branches of some neighbouring
tree. All the smaller birds form the train of its pursuers; but the
wry-neck, in particular, is found the most active in the chase; and from
thence it has been called by many <PB N="267" REF="294"/> the cuckoo's attendant
and provider. But it is very far from following with a friendly inten∣tion; it
only pursues as an insulter, or a spy, to warn all its little companions
of the cuckoo's depredations.</P>
<P>Such are the manners of this bird while it continues to
reside, or to be seen amongst us. But early, at the approach of winter,
it totally disappears, and its passage can be traced to no other counrty.
Some suppose that it lies hid in hollow trees; and others that it
passes into warmer climates. Which of these opinions is true is very
uncertain, as there are no facts related on either side that can be totally
relied on. To support the opinion that they remain torpid during the winter,
at home, Willoughby introduces the following story, which he delivers upon
the credit of another. 
<Q REND="inline">"The servants of a gentleman, in the country,
having stocked up, in one of their meadows, some old dry rotten willows,
thought proper, on a certain occasion, to carry them home. In heating a
stove, two logs of this timber were put into the furnace beneath, and fire
applied as usual. But soon, to the great surprize of the family, was
heard the voice of a cuckoo, singing three times from under the stove.
Won∣dering at so extraordinary a cry in winter <PB N="268" REF="295"/> time,
the servants ran and drew the willow logs from the furnace, and in the
midst one of them saw something move: wherefore, taking an ax, they
opened the hole, and thrusting in their hands, first they plucked out
nothing but feathers; afterwards they got hold of a living animal; and this was
the cuckoo that had waked so very opportunely for its own safety. It was,
indeed," conti∣nues our historian, "brisk and lively, but wholly naked and
bare of feathers, and without any winter provision in its hole. This cuckoo
the boys kept two years after∣wards alive in the stove; but whether it
re∣paid them with a second song, the author of the tale has not thought fit
to inform us."</Q></P>
<P>The most probable opinion on this subject is, that as quails
and wood-cocks shift their habi∣tations in winter, so also does the
cuckoo; but to what country it retires, or whether it has been ever seen on
its journey, are questions that I am wholly incapable of resolving.</P>
<P>Of this bird there are many kinds in various parts of the world,
not only differing in their colours but their size. Brisson makes not
less than twenty-eight sorts of them; but what ana∣logy they bear to our
English cuckoo I will not take upon me to determine. He talks of one, 
<PB N="269" REF="296"/> particularly of Brasil, as making a most horrible
noise in the forests; which, as it should seem, must be a very
different note from that by which our bird is distinguished at home.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. Of the Parrot and its Affinities.</HEAD>
<P>THE Parrot is the best known among us of all foreign birds, as
it unites the greatest beauty with the greatest docility. Its voice also
is more like a man's than that of any other; the raven is too hoarse, and the
jay and magpie too shrill, to resemble the truth; the parrot's note is of
the true pitch, and capable of a number of modulations that even some of our
orators might wish in vain to imitate.</P>
<P>The ease with which this bird is taught to speak, and the
great number of words which it is capable of repeating, are no less
surprizing. We are assured, by a grave writer, that one of these was
taught to repeat a whole sonnet from Petrarch; and that I may not be wanting
in my instance, I have seen a parrot, belonging to a distiller, who had
suffered pretty largely in his circumstances from an informer who lived
op∣posite him, very ridiculously employed. This bird was taught to
pronounce the ninth com∣mandment, 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>Thou shalt not bear false witness
against thy neighbour,</HI></Q> with a very clear, loud, articulate voice.
The bird was generally placed <PB REF="298"/>

cage over against the informer's house, and delighted the whole
neighbourhood with its persevering exhortations.</P>
<P>Willoughby tells a story of a parrot, which is not so dull
as those usually brought up when this bird's facility of talking happens to
be the subject. 
<Q REND="inline">"A parrot belonging to king Henry the Seventh,
who then resided at Westminster, in his palace by the river Thames, had
learned to talk many words from the passengers as they happened to take
water. One day, sporting on its perch, the poor bird fell into the water, at
the same time crying out, as loud as he could, <HI>A boat, twenty pound for a
boat.</HI> A waterman, who happened to be near, hearing the cry, made to the
place where the parrot was floating, and taking him up restored him to the
king. As it seems the bird was a favourite, the man insisted that he
ought to have a reward rather equal to his services than his trouble; and, as
the parrot had cried twenty pounds, he said the king was bound in honour to
grant it. The king at last agreed to leave it to the parrot's own
determination, which the bird hearing, cried out, <HI>Give the knave a
groat.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>The parrot, which is so common as a foreign bird with us, is
equally so as an indignous bird in the climates where it is produced. The
fo∣rests <PB N="272" REF="302"/> swarm with them; and the rook is not better
known with us than the parrot in al∣most every part of the East and
Western Indies. It is in vain that our naturalists have attempted to
arrange the various species of this bird; new varieties daily offer to puzzle
the system-maker, or to demonstrate the narrowness of his cata∣logues.
Linnaeus makes the number of its varieties amount to forty-seven; while
Brisson doubles the number, and extends his catalogue to ninety-five.
Perhaps even this list might be encreased, were every accidental change of
co∣lour to be considered as constituting a new species. But, in fact,
natural history gains little by these discoveries; and as its dominions
are extended it becomes more barren. It is asserted, by sensible
travellers, that the natives of Brasil can change the colour of a parrot's
plumage by art. If this be true, and I am apt to believe the information, they
can make new species at pleasure, and thus cut out endless work for our
nomenclators at home.</P>
<P>Those who usually bring these birds over are content to
make three or four distinctions, to which they give names; and with these
distinctions I will content myself also. The large kind, which are of the
size of a raven, are called Maccaws; the next size are simply called
Parrots; those which are entirely white are called Lories; and 
<PB N="273" REF="303"/> the lesser size of all are called Parakeets. The
difference between even these is rather in the size than in any other
peculiar conformation, as they are all formed alike, having toes two before and
two behind for climbing and holding; strong hooked bills for breaking open
nuts, and other hard substances, on which they feed; and loud harsh
voices, by which they fill their na∣tive woods with clamour.</P>
<P>But there are further peculiarities in the conformation: and
first, their toes are contrived in a singular manner, which appears when
they walk or climb, and when they are eating. For the first purpose they
stretch two of their toes forward and two backward; but when they take their
meat, and bring it to their mouths with their foot, they dexterously and
nimbly turn the greater hind toe forward, so as to take a firmer grasp of
the nut or the fruit they are going to feed on, standing all the while upon
the other leg. Nor even do they present their food in the usual manner; for
other animals turn their meat inwards to the mouth; but these, in a
seemingly aukward position, turn their meat outwards, and thus hold the
hardest nuts, as if in one hand, till with their bills they break the
shell, and extract the kernel.</P>
<P>The bill is fashioned with still greater pecu∣liarites; 
<PB N="274" REF="304"/> for the upper chap, as well as the lower, are both
moveable. In most other birds the upper chap is connected, and makes but one
piece with the skull; but in these, and in one or two species of the
feathered tribe more, the upper chap is connected to the bone of the head by a
strong membrane, placed on each side, that lifts and depresses it at
pleasure. By this contrivance they can open their bills the wider; which is
not a little useful, as the upper chap is so hooked and so over-hanging,
that, if the lower chap only had motion, they could scarce gape
sufficiently to take any thing in for their nourishment.</P>
<P>Such are the uses of the beak and the toes when used
separately, but they are often em∣ployed both together when the bird is
exercised in climbing. As these birds cannot readily hop from bough to
bough, their legs not being adapted for that purpose, they use both the
beak and the feet; first catching hold with the beak, as if with a hook, then
drawing up the legs and fastening them, then advancing the head and the beak
again, and so putting for∣ward the body and the feet alternately, till they
attain the height they aspire to.</P>
<P>The tongue of this bird somewhat resembles that of a man;
for which reason, some pretend <PB N="275" REF="305"/> that it is so well
qualified to imitate the human speech; but the organs by which these
sounds are articulated lie farther down in the throat, being performed by the
great motion which the os hyoides has in these birds above others.</P>
<P>The parrot, though common enough in Europe, will not, however,
breed here. The climate is too cold for its warm constitution; and though it
bears our winter when arrived at maturity, yet it always seems sensible
of its rigour, and loses both its spirit and appetite during the colder
part of the season. It then becomes torpid and inactive, and seems quite
changed from that bustling loquacious animal which it appeared in its native
forests, where it is almost ever upon the wing. Notwithstanding, the
parrot lives even with us a considerable time, if it be properly attended to;
and, indeed, it must be owned, that it employs but too great a part of some
people's attention.</P>
<P>The extreme sagacity and docility of the bird may plead as the
best excuse for those who spend whole hours in teaching their parrots
to speak; and, indeed, the bird, on those occa∣sions, seems the
wisest animal of the two. It at first obstinately resists all
instruction; but seems to be won by perseverance, makes a few attempts to
imitate the first sounds, and when <PB N="276" REF="306"/> it has got one
word distinct, all the succeeding come with greater facility. The bird
gene∣rally learns most in those families where the master or mistress
have the least to do; and becomes more expert, in proportion as its
in∣structors are idly assiduous. In going through the towns of France
sometime since, I could not help observing how much plainer their parrots
spoke than ours, and how very distinctly I under∣stood their parrots
speak French, when I could not understand our own, though they spoke my
native language. I was at first for ascrib∣ing it to the different
qualities of the two lan∣guages, and was for entering into an elaborate
discussion on the vowels and consonants; but a friend that was with me
solved the difficulty at once, by assuring me that the French women
scarce did any thing else the whole day than sit and instruct their
feathered pupils; and that the birds were thus distinct in their lessons
in con∣sequence of continual schooling.</P>
<P>The parrots of France are certainly very ex∣pert, but nothing to
those of the Brasils, where the education of a parrot is considered as a
very serious affair. The History of Prince Maurice's parrot, given us by
Mr. Locke, is too well known to be repeated here; but Clusius assures us
that the parrots of that country are the most <PB N="277" REF="307"/>
sensible and cunning of all animals not endued with reason. The great
parrot, called the Aicurous, the head of which is adorned with yellow, red and
violet, the body green, the ends of the wings red, the feathers of the tail
long and yellow; this bird, he asserts, which is seldom brought into
Europe, is a prodigy of understanding. 
<Q REND="inline">"A certain Brasilian woman, that lived in a
village two miles distant from the island on which we resided, had a
parrot of this kind which was the wonder of the place. It seemed endued with
such understanding, as to discern and comprehend whatever she said to
it. As we sometimes used to pass by that woman's house, she used to
call upon us to stop, promising, if we gave her a comb, or a
looking-glass, that she would make her parrot sing and dance to entertain
us. If we agreed to her request, as soon as she had pronounced some
words to the bird, it began not only to leap and skip on the perch on which
it stood, but also to talk and to whistle, and imitate the shoutings
and exclamations of the Brasilians when they prepare for battle. In brief,
when it came into the woman's head to bid it sing, it sang; to dance, it
danced. But if, contrary to our promise, we refused to give the wo∣man the
little present agreed on, the parrot <PB N="278" REF="308"/> seemed to
sympathize in her resentment, and was silent and immoveable; neither
could we, by any means, provoke it to move either foot or tongue."</Q></P>
<P>This sagacity, which parrots shew in a do∣mestic state,
seems also natural to them in their native residence among the woods.
They live together in flocks, and mutually assist each other against
other animals, either by their courage or their notes of warning. They
generally breed in hollow trees, where they make a round hole, and do not line
their nest within. If they find any part of a tree be∣ginning to rot from the
breaking off a branch, or any such accident, this they take care to scoop,
and to make the hole sufficiently wide and convenient; but it sometimes
happens that they are content with the hole which a wood-pecker has wrought out
with greater ease before them; and in this they prepare to hatch and bring up
their young.</P>
<P>They lay two or three eggs; and probably the smaller kind may
lay more; for it is a rule that universally holds through nature, that the
smallest animals are always the most prolific; for being, from their
natural weakness, more subject to devastation, Nature finds it
necessary to replenish the species by superior fecundity. In general,
however, the number of their eggs <PB N="279" REF="309"/> is stinted to two,
like those of the pigeon, and they are about the same size. They are
always marked with little specks, like those of a par∣tridge; and some
travellers assure us, that they are always found in the trunks of the
tallest, straightest, and the largest trees. The natives of these
countries, who have little else to do, are very assiduous in spying out
the places where the parrot is seen to nestle, and generally come with
great joy to inform the Europeans, if there be any, of the discovery. As
those birds have always the greatest docility that are taken young, such
a nest is often considered as worth taking some trouble to be
possessed of; and, for this purpose, the usual method of coming at
the young is, by cutting down the tree. In the fall of the tree it often
happens that the young parrots are killed; but if one of them survives the
shock, it is considered as a sufficient recompence.</P>
<P>Such is the avidity with which these birds are sought when
young; for it is known they always speak best when their ear has not been
anticipated by the harsh notes of the wild ones. But as the natives are not
able upon all occasions to supply the demand for young ones, they are
contented to take the old; and for that purpose shoot them in the woods
with heavy arrows, headed <PB N="280" REF="310"/> with cotton, which knocks down
the bird with∣out killing it. The parrots thus stunned are car∣ried home:
some die, but others recover, and, by kind usage and plentiful food, become
talka∣tive and noisy.</P>
<P>But it is not for the sake of their conversation alone that
the parrot is sought after among the savages; for, though some of them
are but tough and ill-tasted, yet there are other sorts, particularly of
the small parakeet tribe, that are very delicate food. In general it obtains,
that whatever fruit or grain these birds mostly feed upon, their flesh
partakes of the flavour, and becomes good or ill tasted, according to the
quality of their particular diet. When the guava is ripe, they are at that
season fat and tender; if they feed upon the seed of the acajou, their
flesh contracts an agreeable flavour of garlick; if they feed upon the seed
of the spicy trees, their flesh then tastes of cloves and cinnamon;
while, on the contrary, it is insupportably bitter if the berries they feed
on are of that quality. The seed of the cotton-tree intoxicates them in the
same manner as wine does man; and even wine itself is drunk by parrots, as
Aristotle assures us, by which they are thus rendered more talkative and
amusing. But of all food, they are fondest of the carthamus, or bastard 
<PB N="281" REF="311"/> saffron; which, though strongly purgative to man,
agrees perfectly with their constitution, and fattens them in a very short
time.</P>
<P>Of the parakeet kind in Brasil, Labat assures us, that
they are the most beautiful in their plumage, and the most talkative birds
in na∣ture. They are very tame, and appear fond of mankind; they seem
pleased with holding parley with him; they never have done; but while he
continues to talk, answer him, and appear resolved to have the last word:
but they are possessed of another quality which is suffi∣cient to put
an end to this association: their flesh is the most delicate
imaginable, and highly esteemed by those who are fonder of indulging their
appetites than their ears. The fowler walks into the woods, where they keep in
abun∣dance; but as they are green, and exactly the colour of the leaves among
which they sit, he only hears their prattle, without being able to see a
single bird; he looks round him, sensible that his game is within
gun-shot in abundance, but is mortified to the last degree that it is
im∣possible to see them. Unfortunately for these little animals, they
are restless and ever on the wing, so that in flying from one tree to
another he has but too frequent opportunities of de∣stroying them; for as
soon as they have stripped <PB N="282" REF="312"/> the tree on which they
sate of all its berries, some one of them flies off to another; and, if
that be found fit for the purpose, it gives a loud call, which all the rest
resort to. That is the opportunity the fowler has long been waiting for; he
fires in among the flock while they are yet on the wing; and he seldom fails
of bring∣ing down a part of them. But it is singular enough to see them
when they find their com∣panions fallen. They set up a loud outcry, as if
they were chiding their destroyer, and do not cease till they see him
preparing for a second charge.</P>
<P>But, though there are so many motives for destroying these
beautiful birds, they are in very great plenty; and in some countries on the
coast of Guinea, they are considered by the Negroes as their greatest
tormentors. The flocks of parrots persecute them with their unceasing
screaming; and devour whatever fruits they attempt to pro∣duce by art in
their little gardens. In other places they are not so destructive, but
sufficiently common; and, indeed, there is scarce a country of the tropical
climates that has not many of the common kinds as well as same peculiarly its
own. Travellers have counted more than an hundred different kinds on the
continent of Africa only; there is one country in particular, 
<PB N="283" REF="313"/> north of the Cape of Good Hope, which takes its name
from the multitude of parrots which are seen in its woods. There are white
parrots seen in the burning regions of Ethiopia; in the East-Indies, they
are of the largest size; in South-America, they are docile and talkative;
in all the islands of the Pacific Sea and the Indian Ocean, they swarm in
great variety and abundance, and add to the splendour of those woods which
Nature has dressed in eternal green.</P>
<P>So generally are these birds known at present, and so
great is their variety, that nothing seems more extraordinary than that there
was but one sort of them known among the ancients, and that at a time when
they pretended to be masters of the world. If nothing else could serve to
shew the vanity of a Roman's boast, the parrot-tribe might be an
instance, of which there are an hundred kinds now known, not one of which
naturally breeds in the countries that acknowledged the Roman power. The green
parakeet, with a red neck, was the first of this kind that was brought into
Europe, and the only one that was known to the ancients from the time of
Alexander the Great to the age of Nero. This was brought from India; and when
afterwards the Romans began to seek and <PB N="284" REF="314"/> and rummage
through all their dominions, for new and unheard of luxuries, they at last
found out others in Gaganda, an island of Ethiopia, which they considered
as an extraordinary dis∣covery.</P>
<P>Parrots have usually the same disorders with other birds;
and they have one or two peculiar to their kind. They are sometimes struck
by a kind of apoplectic blow, by which they fall from their perches, and for a
while seem ready to expire. The other is the growing of the beak, which
becomes so very much hooked as to deprive them of the power of eating.
These infirmities, however, do not hinder them from being long-lived; for a
parrot well kept will live five or six and twenty years.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. The Pigeon and its Varieties.</HEAD>
<P>THIS is one of the birds which, from its great fecundity, we
have, in some measure, reclaimed from a state of nature, and taught to
live in habits of dependance. Indeed, its fe∣cundity seems to be encreased
by human culti∣vation, since those pigeons that live in a wild state, in
the woods, are by no means so fruitful as those in our pigeon-houses
nearer home. The power of encrease in most birds depends upon the quantity
of their food; and it is seen, in more than one instance, that man, by
sup∣plying food in plenty, and allowing the animal at the same time a
proper share of freedom, has brought some of those kinds which are known
to lay but once a year, to become much more prolific.</P>
<P>The tame pigeon, and all its beautiful va∣rieties, derive their
origin from one species, the Stock Dove only, the English name, implying
its being the stock or stem from whence the other domestic kinds have
been propagated. This bird, in its natural state, is of a deep blueish
ash colour; the breast dashed with a fine change∣able 
<PB N="286" REF="316"/> green and purple; its wings marked with two black bars;
the back white, and the tail barred near the end with black. These are the
colours of the pigeon in a state of nature; and from these simple tints
has man by art propa∣gated a variety that words cannot describe, nor even
fancy suggest. However, Nature still perseveres in her great out-line;
and though the form, colour, and even the fecundity of these birds may be
altered by art, yet their na∣tural manners and inclinations continue still
the same.</P>
<P>The stock-dove, in its native woods, differs from the
ring-dove, a bird that has never been reclaimed, by its breeding in the holes
of rocks and the hollows of trees. All other birds of the pigeon-kind build
like rooks, in the topmost branches of the forest, and chuse their
habitation as remote as possible from man. But this spe∣cies soon takes
to build in artificial cavities; and, from the temptation of a ready
provision and numerous society, easily submits to the ty∣ranny of man.
Still, however, it preserves its native colour for several generations, and
becomes more variegated only in proportion as it removes from the original
simplicity of its co∣louring in the woods.</P>
<P>The dove-house pigeon, as is well known, <PB N="287" REF="317"/> breeds every month; but then it is necessary to supply it with
food when the weather is severe, or the fields are covered with snow. Upon
other occasions, it may be left to provide for itself; and it generally
repays the owner for his protection. The pigeon lays two white eggs, which
most usually produce young ones of differ∣ent sexes. For the laying of
each egg, it is necessary to have a particular congress with the male;
and the egg is usually deposited in the afternoon. When the eggs are thus
laid, the female in the space of fifteen days, not including the three days
during which she is employed in laying, continues to hatch, relieved at
intervals by the male. The turns are usually regulated with great
exactness. From three or four o'clock in the evening till nine the next day,
the female continues to sit; she is then relieved by the male, who takes
his place from ten till three, while his mate is feeding abroad. In this manner
they sit alternately till the young are excluded. If, during this term, the
female de∣lays to return at the expected time, the male follows, and drives her
to the nest; and, should he in his turn be dilatory, she retaliates with
equal severity.</P>
<P>The young ones when hatched require no food for the three
first days, only wanting to <PB N="288" REF="318"/> be kept warm, which is an
employment the female takes entirely upon herself. During this period, she
never stirs out, except for a few minutes to take a little food. From this
they are fed for eight or ten days, with corn or grain of different kinds,
which the old ones gather in the fields, and keep treasured up in their
crops, from whence they throw it up again into the mouths of their young ones
who very greedily demand it.</P>
<P>As this method of feeding the young from the crop is different
in birds of the pigeon-kind from all others, it demands a more detailed
explanation. Of all birds, for its size, the pigeon has the largest crop,
which is also made in a manner quite peculiar to the kind. In two of these
that were dissected by a member of the Royal Academy of Sciences, it was
found that if the anatomist blew air into the wind-pipe, it distended the
crop or gullet to a pro∣digious size. This was the more extraordinary as
there seemed to be no communication what∣soever between these two
receptacles, as the conduit by which we breathe, as every one knows, leads to a
very different receptacle from that where we put our food. By what apertures
the air blown into the lungs of the pigeon makes its way into the crop, is
unknown; but <PB N="289" REF="319"/> nothing is more certain than that these
birds have a power of filling the crop with air; and some of them, which are
called croppers, distend it in such a manner, that the bird's breast
seems bigger than its body. The pe∣culiar mechanism of this part is not
well known; but the necessity for it in these animals is pretty obvious.
The pigeon, as we all know, lives entirely upon grain and water: these are
mixed together in the crop; and in the ordinary way are digested in
proportion as the bird lays in its provision. But to feed its young, which
are very voracious, it is necessary to lay in a store greater than
ordinary, and to give the food a kind of half maceration to suit their tender
appetites. The heat of the bird's body, assisted by air and numerous
glands se∣parating a milky fluid, are the most necessary instruments
for this operation; but, in propor∣tion as the food macerates it begins to
swell also; and the crop must of consequence be considerably dilated.
Still, however, the air which is contained in it gives the bird a power of
contracting it at pleasure; for if it were filled with more solid
substances, the bird could have no power to compress it. But this is not
the case, the bird can compress its crop at plea∣sure; and driving out
the air, can thus drive <PB N="290" REF="320"/> out the food also, which is
forced up the gullet like a pellet from a pop-gun. The young ones open-mouthed
receive this tribute of affec∣tion, and are thus fed three times a day. In
feeding, the male usually supplies the young female; while the old female
supplies the young of the opposite sex. The food with which they are
supplied is more macerated in the beginning; but as they grow older, the
parents give it less preparation, and at last drive them out to shift for
themselves. When well fed, however, the old ones do not wait for the total
dismission of their young; but, in the same nest, are to be found
young ones almost fit for flight, and eggs hatching, at the same time.</P>
<P>The fidelity of the turtle-dove is proverbial, and makes the
usual comparison of such poets as are content to repeat what others have
said before them; but the pigeon of the dove-house is not so faithful;
and, having been subjected to man, it puts on licentiousness among its
other domestic habits. Two males are often seen quarreling for the same
mistress; and when the female admits the addresses of a new gal∣lant,
her old companion seems to bear the con∣tempt with some marks of
displeasure, abstains from her company, or if he approaches, it is only
to chastise her. There have been instances when two males, being
displeased with their <PB N="291" REF="321"/> respective mates, have
thought proper to make an exchange, and have lived in great harmony with their
new companions.</P>
<P>So great is the produce of this bird in its domestic state,
that near fifteen thousand may in the space of four years be produced from
a single pair. But the stock-dove seldom breeds above twice a year; for,
when the winter months come, the whole employment of the fond cou∣ple is rather
for self-preservation, than trans∣mitting a posterity. They seem,
however, to have a stronger attachment to their young than those who are
found to breed so often; whe∣ther it be that instinct acts more powerfully
upon them in their state of nature, or that their affections are less
divided by the multiplicity of claims.</P>
<P>It is from a species of these, therefore, that those
pigeons which are called Carriers, and are used to convey letters, are
produced. These are easily distinguished from all others by their eyes,
which are compassed about with a broad circle of naked white skin, and by
being of a dark blue or blackish colour. It is from their at∣tachment to
their native place, and particularly where they have brought up their young,
that these birds are employed in several countries as the most
expeditious carriers. They are first <PB N="292" REF="322"/> brought from the
place where they were bred, and whither it is intended to send them back with
information. The letter is tied under the bird's wing, and it is then let
loose to return. The little animal no sooner finds itself at liberty,
than its passion for its native spot directs all its motions. It is
seen, upon these occasions, flying directly into the clouds to an amazing
height; and then, with the greatest certainty and exactness, directing
itself by some surpriz∣ing instinct towards home, which lies
sometimes at many miles distance, bringing its message to those to
whom it is directed. By what marks they discover the place, by what chart
they are guided in the right way, is to us utterly un∣known; certain it is,
that in the space of an hour and an half they perform a journey of forty
miles; which is a degree of dispatch three times greater than the fleetest
quadrupede can per∣form. These birds are not brought up at pre∣sent with as
much care as formerly, when they were sent from governors in a besieged
city to generals that were coming to relieve it without; when they were sent
from princes to their subjects with the tidings of some fortunate event, or
from lovers to their mistresses with ex∣pressions of their
passion. The only use we now see made of them, is to be let fly at
Tyburn, when the cart is drawn away; pretty much as <PB N="293" REF="323"/> when
some antient heroe was to be interred, an eagle was let off from the funeral
pile, to com∣plete his apotheosis.</P>
<P>The varieties of the tame pigeon are so nu∣merous, that it
would be a vain attempt to mention them: so much is the figure and the colour
of this bird under human controul, that pigeon-fanciers, by coupling a male and
fe∣male of different sorts, can breed them, as they express it, to a
feather. From hence we have the various names of Croppers, Carriers,
Ja∣cobines, Powters, Runts, and Turbits: all birds that at first might have
accidentally va∣ried from the stock-dove; and then, by having these
varieties still heightened by food, cli∣mate and paring, different species
have been produced. But there are many species of the wild pigeon which,
though bearing a strong affinity to the stock-dove, are, nevertheless,
sufficiently different from it to deserve a distinct description. The
Ring-dove is of this num∣ber; a good deal larger than the former, and building
its nest, with a few dry sticks, in the boughs of trees. This seems a
bird much fonder of its native freedom than the former; and attempts have been
frequently made to render it domestic: but they have hitherto proved
fruitless; for, though their eggs have <PB N="294" REF="324"/> been hatched by
the tame pigeon in a dove-house, yet, as soon as they could fly, they
al∣ways betook themselves to the woods where they were first produced. In
the beginning of winter, these assemble in great flocks in the woods, and
leave off cooing; nor do they re∣sume this note of courtship till the
beginning of March, when the genial season, by supply∣ing them with food,
renews their desires.</P>
<P>The turtle-dove is a smaller, but a much shyer, bird than
any of the former. It may easily be distinguished from the rest by the
iris of the eye, which is of a fine yellow, and by a beautiful crimson circle
that encompasses the eye-lids. The fidelity of these birds is noted; and
a pair being put in a cage, if one dies, the other will not survive it. The
turtle-dove is a bird of passage, and few or none remain in our northern
climates in winter. They fly in flocks when they come to breed here in
summer, and delight in open, mountainous, sandy countries. But they build
their nests in the midst of woods, and chuse the most retired
situations for incu∣bation. They feed upon all sorts of grain, but are
fondest of millet-seed.</P>
<P>To this short list might be added a long ca∣talogue of
foreign pigeons, of which we know little more than the plumage and the names: 
<PB N="295" REF="325"/> indeed, the variety of their plumage is as beau∣tiful as
the names by which they are known are harsh and dissonant. The
Ocotzimtzcan, for instance, is one of the most splendid tenants of the
Mexican forests; but few, I believe, would desire to learn the name, only
to be in∣formed that it is covered with purple, green, and yellow plumage. To
describe such birds, the historian's pen is not half such an useful
implement as the painter's pencil.</P>

<HEAD>PART IV. OF BIRDS OF THE SPARROW KIND.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="299" REF="327"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. I. Of Birds of the Sparrow Kind in General.</HEAD>
<P>STILL descending from the larger to the smaller, we come to
birds of the sparrow kind; or that class of beautiful little animals that,
being less than the pigeon, go on diminishing till we arrive at the
humming-bird, the smallest of the feathered creation.</P>
<P>The birds which compose this class, chiefly live in the
neighbourhood of man, and are his greatest favourites. The falcon may be more
esteemed, and the turkey more useful; but these he considers as
servants, not as friends; as animals reclaimed merely to supply him with
some of the conveniences of life: but these little painted songsters
have his affections, as well from their beauty as their melody; it is this
delightful class that fill his groves with harmony, and lift his heart to
sympathize with their rap∣tures. All the other classes are either mute or
screaming; it is this diminutive tribe only that have voices equal to the
beauty of their figures; equally adapted to rejoice man, and delight each
other.</P>
<P><PB N="300" REF="328"/>As they are the favourites of man, so
they are chiefly seen near him. All the great birds dread his vicinity, and
keep to the thickest darkness of the forest, or the brow of the most
craggy precipice: but these seldom resort to the thicker parts of the
wood; they keep near its edges, in the neighbourhood of cultivated fields; in
the hedge-rows of farm-grounds; and even in the yard, mixing with the
poultry.</P>
<P>It must be owned, indeed, that their living near man is not a
society of affection on their part, as they approach inhabited grounds merely
because their chief provision is to be found there. In the depth of the
desart, or the gloom of the forest, there is no grain to be picked up; none
of these tender buds that are so grateful to their appetites; insects,
them∣selves, that make so great a part of their food, are not found there
in abundance; their natures being unsuited to the moisture of the place. As
we enter, therefore, deeper into uncultivated woods, the silence becomes more
profound; every thing carries the look of awful stillness; there are none
of those warblings, none of those murmurs that awaken attention, as near
the habitations of men; there is nothing of that confused buzz, formed by the
united though <PB N="301" REF="329"/> distant voices of quadrupedes and birds;
but all is profoundly dead and solemn. Now and then, indeed, the traveller
may be rouzed from this lethargy of life, by the voice of an heron, or the
scream of an eagle; but his sweet little friends and warblers have totally
forsaken him.</P>
<P>There is still another reason for these little birds
avoiding the depths of the forest; which is, that their most formidable
enemies usually reside there. The greater birds, like robbers, chuse the
most dreary solitudes for their re∣treats; and, if they do not find they
make a desart all around them. The small-birds fly from their tyranny, and
take protection in the vicinity of man, where they know their more unmerciful
foes will not venture to pursue them.</P>
<P>All birds, even those of passage, seem con∣tent with a
certain district to provide food and center in. The red-breast or the wren
seldom leaves the field where it has been brought up, or where its young have
been excluded; even though hunted it flies along the hedge, and seems fond of
the place with an imprudent per∣severance. The fact is, all these small
birds mark out a territory to themselves, which they will permit none of
their own species to remain in; they guard their dominions with the most 
<PB N="302" REF="330"/> watchful resentment; and we seldom find two male
tenants in the same hedge together.</P>
<P>Thus, though fitted by nature for the most wandering life,
these little animals do not make such distant excursions, during the
season of their stay, as the stag or the leveret. Food seems to be
the only object that puts them in motion, and when that is provided for them in
sufficient plenty they never wander. But as that is seldom permanent
through the year, almost every bird is then obliged to change its abode. Some
are called birds of passage, be∣cause they are obliged to take long
journeys for this purpose; but, strictly speaking, almost every other
kind are birds of passage, though their migration may not be to places so
re∣mote. At some particular season of the year, all small birds migrate
either from one county to another, or from the more inland provinces towards
the shore.</P>
<P>There are several persons who get a livelihood by watching
the seasons when our small birds begin to migrate from one county to
another, and by taking them with nets in their passage. The birds are found
to fly, as the bird-catchers term it, chiefly during the month of October, and
part of September and November. There is also another flight in March, which
is much less considerable than that in autumn. <PB N="303" REF="331"/> Nor
is it less remarkable, that several of these species of flight-birds
make their appearance in regular succession. The pippit, for instance,
begins its flight every year about Michaelmas, when they are caught in
greatest number. To this the wood-lark succeeds, and continues its flight
till towards the middle of October; other birds follow, but are not so
punctually perio∣dical; the green-finch does not begin till the frost obliges
it to seek for a change. These birds, during those months, fly from
day-break till twelve at noon; and there is afterwards a small flight from
two till night. Such are the seasons of the migration of the birds, which
have been usually considered as stationary, and on these occasions
they are caught in great abun∣dance, as they are on their journey. But the
same arts used to allure them upon other occa∣sions would be utterly
fruitless, as they avoid the nets with the most prudent circumspection.
The autumnal flight probably consists of the parents conducting their
new-fledged young to those places where there is sufficient provision,
and a proper temperament of the air during the winter season; and their
return in spring is ob∣viously from an attachment to the place which was
found so convenient before for the purposes of nestling and
incubation.</P>
<P><PB N="304" REF="332"/>Autumn is the principal season when
the bird-catcher employs his art to catch these wan∣derers. His nets are a
most ingenious piece of mechanism, being generally twelve yards and a half
long, and two yards and a half wide, and so contrived as from a flat
position to rise on each side, and clap over the birds that are de∣coyed
to come between them. The birds in their passage are always observed to
fly against the wind; hence there is a great contention among the
bird-catchers which shall gain the wind; for example, if it is westerly,
the bird-catcher who lays his nets most to the east, is sure of the
most plentiful sport if his call-birds are good. For this purpose, he
generally car∣ries five or six linnets, two gold-finches, two green-finches,
one wood-lark, one red-poll, and perhaps a bull-finch, a yellow-hammer, a
tit-lark, and an aberdavine: these are placed at small distances from the
nets in little cages. He has besides what he calls his flur-birds, which are
placed upon a moveable perch, which the bird-catcher can raise at pleasure
by means of a string; and these he always lifts gently up and down as the
wild bird approaches. But this is not enough to allure the wild bird down; it
must be called by one of the call-birds in the cages; and these, by being
made to moult pre∣maturely <PB N="305" REF="333"/> in a warm cage, call louder
and better than those that are wild and at freedom. There even appears a
malicious joy in these call-birds to bring the wild ones into the same
state of captivity, while at the same time their call is louder and their
plumage brighter than in a state of nature. Nor is their sight or hearing
less exquisite, far exceeding that of the bird-catcher; for the instant
the wild birds are per∣ceived, notice is given by one to the rest of the
call-birds, who all unite in the same tumultuous ecstacy of pleasure. The
call-birds do not sing upon these occasions as a bird does in a chamber,
but incite the wild ones by short jerks, which, when the birds are good, may
be heard at a great distance. The allurement of this call is so great, that
the wild bird hearing it is stopped in its most rapid flight; and, if not
already ac∣quainted with the nets, lights boldly within twenty yards perhaps of
the bird-catcher, and on a spot which it would otherwise have quite
disregarded. This is the opportunity wished for, and the bird-catcher
pulling a string, the nets on each side rise in an instant, and clap
di∣rectly down on the poor little unsuspecting vi∣sitant. Nay, it
frequently happens that if half a flock only are caught, the remaining half
will immediately afterwards light between the nets, <PB N="306" REF="334"/> and
share the fate of their companions. Should only one bird escape, this
unhappy survivor will also venture into danger till it is caught; such a
fascinating power have the call-birds.</P>
<P>Indeed, it is not easy to account for the nature of this call,
whether it be a challenge to combat, an invitation to food, or a prelude to
courtship. As the call-birds are all males, and as the wild birds that attend
to their voice are most frequently males also, it does not seem that love
can have any influence in their assiduity. Perhaps the wild females, in
these flights, attend to and obey the call below, and their male companions
of the flight come down to bear them company. If this be the case, and that
the females have unfaithfully led their mates into the nets, they are the
first that are punished for their infidelity; the males are only made
captives for singing; while the females are indiscriminately killed, and
sold to be served up to the tables of the delicate.</P>
<P>Whatever be the motives that thus arrest a flock of birds in
their flight, whether they be of gallantry or of war, it is certain that the
small birds are equally remarkable for both. It is, perhaps, the genial
desire that in∣spires the courage of most animals; and that being
greatest in the males, gives them a <PB N="307" REF="335"/> greater degree of
valour than the females. Small birds, being extremely amorous, are re∣markably
brave. However contemptible these little warriors are to larger creatures,
they are often but too formidable to each other; and sometimes fight till one
of them yields up his life with the vlctory. But their contentions are
sometimes of a gentler nature. Two male birds shall strive in song
till, after a long struggle, the loudest shall entirely silence the
other. During these contentions, the female sits an attentive silent
auditor, and often re∣wards the loudest songster with her company during
the season.</P>
<P>Singing among birds is almost universally the prerogative of
the male. With them it is the reverse of what occurs in the human kind. Among
the feathered tribe, the heaviest cares of life fall to the lot of the
female. Hers is the fatigue of incubation, and to her devolves the principal
fatigue of nursing the helpless brood. To alleviate these fatigues, and
to support her under them, Nature has given the song to the male. This
serves as a note of blandishment at first to attract her affections; it
serves as a note to delight her during the time of her incubation; but it
serves still farther as a note of security, to assure her that no
danger threatens <PB N="308" REF="336"/> to molest her. The male, while his
mate is hatching, sits upon some neighbouring tree, continuing at once to
watch and to sing. While his voice is heard, the female rests in confident
security; and, as the poet expresses it, appears 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>most blessed when most
unseen:</HI></Q> But if any appearance of danger offers to intrude, the male,
that a moment before was so loud and sportive, stops all of a sudden;
and this is a most certain signal to his mate to provide for her own
security.</P>
<P>The nest of little birds seems to be of a more delicate
contrivance than that of the larger kinds. As the volume of their bodies is
smaller, the materials of which their nests are composed are generally
warmer. It is easy to conceive that small things keep heat a shorter time
than those that are large. The eggs, therefore, of small birds require a
place of more constant warmth than those of great ones, as being liable to
cool more quickly; and accordingly their nests are built warmer and deeper,
lined on the inside with softer substances, and guarded above with a
better covering. But it sometimes happens that the little archi∣tects are
disturbed in their operations, and then they are obliged to make a nest;
not such as they wish, but such as they can. The bird, 
<PB N="309" REF="337"/> whose nest has been robbed several times, builds
up her last in a very slovenly manner, conscious that, from the near
approach of winter, she must not take time to give her habitation every
possible advantage it is capable of receiving. When the nest is
finished, nothing can exceed the cunning which the male and female em∣ploy to
conceal it. If it is built in bushes, the pliant branches are so
disposed as to hide it entirely from the view; if it be built among moss,
nothing outwardly appears to shew that there is an habitation within. It is
always built near those places where food is found in greatest abundance;
and they take care never to go in or out while there is any one in sight. The
greater birds continue from their nest for some time, as their eggs take no
damage in their absence; but the little birds are assiduous while they
sit, and the nest is always occupied by the male when the female is obliged
to seek for sustenance.</P>
<P>The first food of all birds of the sparrow kind is worms and
insects. Even the sparrow and the gold-finch, that when adult feed only
upon grain, have both been fed upon insects while in the nest. The young
ones, for some time after their exclusion from the shell, require no
food; but the parent soon finds by their chirping <PB N="310" REF="338"/> and
gaping that they begin to feel the ap∣proaches of hunger, and flies to provide
them a plentiful supply. In her absence, they con∣tinue to lie close
together, and cherish each other by their mutual warmth. During this interval
also, they preserve a perfect silence, uttering not the slightest
note till the parent returns. Her arrival is always announced by a chirrup,
which they perfectly understand, and which they answer all together, each
petitioning for its portion. The parent distributes a supply to each by
turns, cautiously avoiding to gorge them, but to give them often though
little at a time. The wren will in this manner feed seventeen or eighteen
young ones, without pas∣sing over one of them.</P>
<P>Such is the manner in which these birds bring forth and hatch
their young; but it yet remains to usher them from the nest into life, and
this they very assiduously perform. When they are fully fledged, and
fitted for short flights, the old ones, if the weather be fair, lead them a
few yards from the nest, and then compel them to return. For two or three
succeeding days they are led out in the same manner, but each day to seek
more distant adventures. When it is per∣ceived that they can fly, and shift
for themselves, then the parents forsake them for ever, and 
<PB N="311" REF="339"/> pay them no more attention than they do to other birds
in the same flock. Indeed, it would seem among these little animals that,
from the moment their young are set out, all future con∣nexion ceases
between the male and female; they go separate ways, each to provide for
itself, during the rigours of winter; and, at the approach of spring, each
seeks for a new asso∣ciate.</P>
<P>In general, birds, when they come to pair in spring,
associate with those of their own age and place of abode. Their
strength or courage is generally in proportion to their age; the oldest
females first feel the accesses of desire, and the oldest males are
the boldest to drive off all younger pretenders. Those next in courage and
desire, become pretenders, till they are al∣most all provided in turn. The
youngest come last; as, in fact, they are the latest in their
inclinations. But still there are several, both males and females, that
remain unprovided for; either not happening to meet with each other, or at
least not during the genial interval. Whether these mix with small birds
of a dif∣ferent species, is a doubt which naturalists have not been able
thoroughly to resolve. Addison, in some beautiful Latin lines, inserted
in the Spectator, is entirely of opinion that birds <PB N="312" REF="340"/>
observe a strict chastity of manners, and never admit the caresses of
a different tribe.</P>
<Q> 
<L>Chaste are their instincts, faithful is their fire,</L> 
<L>No foreign beauty tempts to false desire:</L> 
<L>The snow-white vesture, and the glittering crown,</L> 
<L>The simple plumage, or the glossy down,</L> 
<L>Prompt not their love. The patriot bird pursues</L> 
<L>His well acquainted tints, and kindred hues.</L> 
<L>Hence through their tribes no mix'd polluted flame,</L> 
<L>No monster breed to mark the groves with shame:</L> 
<L>But the chaste blackbird, to its partner true,</L> 
<L>Thinks black alone is beauty's favourite hue:</L> 
<L>The nightingale, with mutual passion blest,</L> 
<L>Sings to its mate, and nightly charms the nest:</L> 
<L>While the dark owl, to court his partner flies,</L> 
<L>And owns his offspring in their yellow eyes.</L></Q>
<P>But whatever may be the poet's opinion, the probability is
against this fidelity among the smaller tenants of the grove. The great
birds are much more true to their species than these; and, of
consequence, the varieties among them are more few. Of the ostrich, the
cassowary, and the eagle, there are but few species; and no arts that man
can use, could probably induce them to mix with each other.</P>
<P>But it is otherwise with the small birds we are
describing; it requires very little trouble to make a species between a
goldfinch and <PB N="313" REF="341"/> a canary-bird, between a linnet and a
lark. They breed frequently together; and produce a race not, like the mules
among quadru∣pedes, incapable of breeding again; for this motley mixture are as
fruitful as their pa∣rents. What is so easily done by art, very probably
often happens in a state of nature; and when the male cannot find a mate of
his own species, he flies to one of another, that, like him, has been left
out in pairing. This some historians think may have given rise to the
great variety of small birds that are seen among us; some uncommon
mixture might first have formed a new species, and this might have been
continued down, by birds of this species chu∣sing to breed together.</P>
<P>Whether the great variety of our small birds may have arisen
from this source, cannot now be ascertained; but certain it is, that they
re∣semble each other very strongly, not only in their form and plumage, but
also in their ap∣petites and manner of living. The goldfinch, the linnet, and
the yellow-hammer, though obviously of different species, yet lead a very
similar life; being equally an active, lively, salacious tribe, that
subsist by petty thefts upon the labours of mankind, and repay them with
a song. Their nests bear a similitude; and <PB N="312" REF="342"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/> <PB N="313" REF="343"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/> <PB N="314" REF="344"/> they are
all about the same time in hatching their young, which is usually fifteen
days. Were I therefore to describe the manners of these with the same
minuteness that I have done the greater birds, I should only present the
reader with a repetition of the same accounts; animated neither by novelty
nor information. Instead, therefore, of specifying each sort, I will
throw them into groupes; uniting those together that practise the same
manners, or that are remarkable for similar qualifications.</P>
<P>Willaughby has divided all the smaller birds into those that
have slender bills, and those that have short and thick bills. Those
with slender bills, chiefly live upon insects; those with short,
strong bills, live mostly upon fruits and grain. Among slender billed
birds, he enumerates the thrush, the blackbird, the fieldfare, the
starling, the lark, the titmouse, the water-wagtail, the nightingale, the
red-start, the robin red-breast, the beccafigo, the stone-chatter, the
whinchat, the goldfinch, the white-throat, the hedge-sparrow, the pettichaps,
the golden crowned wren, the wren, the humming-bird, and several other
small birds of the sparrow kind, unknown in this part of the world.</P>
<P>All these, as was said, live for the most part 
<PB N="315" REF="345"/> upon insects; and are consequently of particular
benefit to man. By these are his grounds cleared of the pernicious swarms
of vermin that devour the budding leaves and flowers; and that even attack the
root itself, before ever the vegetable can come to maturity. These seek
for and destroy the eggs of insects that would otherwise propagate in
numbers beyond the arts of man to extirpate: they know better than man where to
seek for them; and thus at once satisfy their own appetites, and render him
the most essential services.</P>
<P>But this is not the only merit of this tribe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in it we have the sweetest
songsters of the grove; their notes are softer, and their manner more
musically soothing than those of hard billed birds. The foremost in
musical fame are, the nightingale, the thrush, the blackbird, the lark, the
red-breast, the black-cap, and the wren.</P>
<P>Birds of the sparrow kind, with thick and short bills, are
the grossbeak, the greenfinch, the bullfinch, the crossbill, the
house-sparrow, the chaffinch, the brambling, the goldfinch, the linnet, the
siskin, the bunting, the yellow-hammer, the ortolan, the wheat-ear, and
several other foreign birds, of which we know rathe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the names than the history. These chiefly feed upon
fruits, grain, and corn. They are often <PB N="316" REF="346"/> troublesome to
man, as they are a numerous tribe: the harvest often suffers from their
de∣predations; and while they are driven off from one end of the field, they
fly round, and come in at the other. But these also have their uses: they
are frequently the distributors of seeds into different districts:
those grains which they swallow, are sometimes, not wholly digested;
and these, laid upon a soil congenial to them, embellish the face of
nature with that agreeable variety which art but vainly attempts to imitate.
The misletoe plant, which we often see growing on the tops of elm and other
trees, has been thought to be propagated in this manner; yet, as it is often
seen growing on the under side of the branch, and sometimes on a
perpendicular shoot, it seems extraordinary how a seed could be
deposited in that situation. However this be, there are many plants
propagated from the depositions of birds; and some seeds are thought to
thrive the better, for first having undergone a kind of maceration in the
stomach of the little animal, before it is voided on the ground.</P>
<P>There are some agreeable songsters in this tribe also;
and those who like a loud piercing pipe, endued with great variety and
perse∣verance, will be pleased most with their singing. The
songsters of this class are the canary-bird, <PB N="317" REF="347"/> the
linnet, the chaffinch, the goldfinch, the greenfinch, the bullfinch, the
brambling, the siskin, and the yellow-hammer. The note of these is not
so generally pleasing as that of the soft billed bird, but it usually
holds longer; and, in a cage, these birds are more easily fed, and
hardy.</P>
<P>This class of small birds, like all the greater, has its
wanderers, that leave us for a season, and then return, to propagate, to
sing, or to embellish the landscape here. Some of this smaller kind,
indeed, are called birds of passage, that do not properly come under the
denomination; for though they disappear in one place, they never leave the
kingdom, but are seen somewhere else. But there are many among them, that
take longer flights, and go to a region colder or warmer, as it suits their
constitutions. The field-fare and the red-wing breed, pass their summers
in Norway, and other cold countries, and are tempted hi∣ther to our mild
winters, and to those various berries which then abound with us, and make
their principal food. The hawfinch and the crossbill are uncertain
visitants, and have no stated times of migration. Swallows of every
species disappear at the approach of winter. The nightingale, the
black-cap, the fly-catcher, <PB N="318" REF="348"/> the willow-wren, the
wheat-ear, the whin-chat, and the stone-chatter, leave us long before the
approach of winter; while the siskin and the linnet only forsake us when
our winters are more than usually severe. All the rest of the smaller
tribe never quit this country; but sup∣port the severest rigours of the
climate.</P>
<P>Yet it must not be supposed that the manners of our little
birds prevail in all other countries; and that such kinds as are stationary
with us, never wander in other parts of Europe: on the contrary, it happens
that many of those kinds which are birds of passage in England, are
seen, in other places, never to depart, but to make one country their fixed
residence, the whole year round. It is also frequent, that some birds,
which with us are faithful residents, in other kingdoms put on the nature of
birds of passage, and disappear for a season.</P>
<P>The swallow, that with us is particularly re∣marked for being
a bird of passage, in Upper Egypt, and in the island of Java, breeds and
continues the whole year, without ever disap∣pearing. Larks, that remain with
us the year throughout, are birds of passage in Sweden; and forsake that
climate in winter, to return again with the returning spring. The chaffinch,
that with us is stationary, appears during the <PB N="319" REF="349"/> winter
in Carolina and Virginia; but disappears totally in summer, to breed in the
more north∣ern regions. In Sweden also, these little birds are seen
returning, at the approach of spring, from the warmer climates, to
pro∣pagate; which being accomplished by the latter end of autumn, the males
and females separate; the males to continue among their native snows, the
females to seek a warmer and gentler winter. On this occasion, they are
seen in flocks, that darken all the air, without a single male among them,
making their way into the more southern regions of Denmark, Germany, and
Holland. In this amazon-like retreat, thousands fall by the way; some by
fatigue, some by want; but the greatest num∣ber by the nets of the fowler;
the taking them being one of the chief amusements among the gentry where they
pass. In short, the change of country with all this little tribe, is rather
a pilgrimage than a journey; a migra∣tion rather of necessity than of
choice.</P>
<P>Having thus given a general idea of the birds of this class,
it will be proper to give some account of the most remarkable among
them.</P>

<PB N="320" REF="350"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. II. Of the Thrush and its Affinities.</HEAD>
<P>WITH the thrush we may rank the red-wing, the field-fare, the
black-bird, the ring-ouzel, and the water-ouzel.</P>
<P>These are the largest of the sparrow-kind, and may be
distinguished from all others of this class, as well by their size,
which is well known, as by their bills, which are a little bending at the
point; a small notch near the end of the upper chap, and the outmost toe
adhering as far as the first joint of the middle toe. To this tribe may be
also added the stare or starling, which, though with a flat bill, too
much resem∣bles these birds to be placed any where else.</P>
<P>The missel-thrush is distinguished from all of the
kind by its superior size, being much larger than any of them. It differs
scarcely in any other respect from the throstle, except that the spots
on the breast are larger. It builds its nest in bushes, or on the side
of some tree, as all of this kind are found to do, and lays four or five eggs
in a season. Its song is very fine, which it begins in spring,
sitting on the summit of a high tree. It is the largest bird of all the 
<PB N="321" REF="351"/> feathered tribe that has music in its voice; the note
of all greater birds being either screaming, chattering, or croaking. It
feeds on insects, holly, and misletoe-berries; and sometimes sends
forth a very disagreeable scream when frighted or disturbed.</P>
<P>The black-bird, which in cold countries, and particularly upon
the Alps, is sometimes seen all over white, is a beautiful and a canorous
bird, whistling all the spring and summer-time with a note at a
distance the most pleasing of all the grove. It is the deepest toned
warbler of the woods; but it is rather unpleasant in a cage, being loud and
deafening. It lays four or five bluish eggs, in a nest usually built at
the stump of some old hawthorn, well plaistered on the inside with
clay, straw, and hair.</P>
<P>Pleasing, however, as this bird may be, the blue-bird,
described by Bellonius, is in every respect far superior. This beautiful
animal en∣tirely resembles a black-bird in all but its blue colour. It lives
in the highest parts of the Alps, and even there chuses the most craggy
rocks and the most frightful precipices for its residence. As it is rarely
caught, it is in high estimation even in the countries where it breeds, but
still more valuable when carried from home. It not only whistles in the
most delight∣ful <PB N="322" REF="352"/> manner, but speaks with an
articulate di∣stinct voice. It is so docile, and observes all things with
such diligence, that, though waked at midnight by any of the family, it will
speak and whistle at the word of command. Its co∣lour, about the beginning
of winter, from blue becomes black, which changes to its original hue on the
first approaches of spring. It makes its nest in deep holes, in very high
and inacces∣sible solitudes, and removes it not only from the
accesses of man, but also hides it with surprizing cunning from the
shammoy, and other wild beasts that might annoy its young.</P>
<P>The manner of taking this beautiful bird is said to be this.
The fowlers, either by chance or by lying in wait, having found out the place
where it builds, take with them a strong stilt or stake, such as the
climbers of rocks make use of to assist them in their ascent. With
the assistance of this, they mount where an indif∣ferent spectator
would think it impossible to ascend, covering their heads at the same
time to ward off any danger of the falling of pebbles or stones from above.
At length, with extreme toil and danger, having arrived at the nest, they
draw it up from the hole in which it is usually buried, and cherish the
young with an assiduity equal to the pains they took to obtain them. It 
<PB N="323" REF="353"/> produces for the most part five young, and never more;
it seldom descends into the plain country; flies swifter than a
black-bird, and uses the same food.</P>
<P>The field-fare and the red-wing make but a short stay in
this country. With us they are insipid tuneless birds, flying in flocks,
and ex∣cessively watchful to preserve the general safety. All their
season of music and pleasure is em∣ployed in the more northern
climates, where they sing most delightfully, perched among the forests of
maples, with which those countries abound. They build their nests in
hedges; and lay six bluish green eggs spotted with black.</P>
<P>The Stare, distinguishable from the rest of this tribe by
the glossy green of its feathers, in some lights, and the purple in
others, breeds in hol∣low trees, eaves of houses, towers, ruins, cliffs, and
often in high rocks over the sea. It lays four or five eggs of a pale
greenish ash-colour; and makes it nest of straw, small fibres of
roots, and such like. Its voice is rougher than the rest of this kind; but
what it wants in the me∣lody of its note, it compensates by the facility with
which it is taught to speak. In winter these birds assemble in vast
flocks, and feed upon worms and insects. At the approach of spring, they
assemble in fields, as if in con∣sultation <PB N="324" REF="354"/>
together, and for three or four days seem to take no nourishment: the
greater part leave the country; the rest breed here and bring up their
young.</P>
<P>To this tribe might be added above an hun∣dred other birds of
nearly the thrush size, and living like them upon fruit and berries. Words
could not afford variety enough to describe all the beautiful tints that
adorn the foreign birds of the thrush kind. The brilliant green of the
emerald, the flaming red of the ruby, the purple of the amethyst, or the
bright blue of the sa∣phire, could not by the most artful combi∣nation
shew any thing so truely lively or de∣lightful to the sight as the
feathers of the chil∣coqui or the tautotol. Passing, therefore, over
these beautiful, but little known, birds, I will only mention the American
mock-bird, the favourite songster of a region where the birds excel rather
in the beauty of their plumage than the sweetness of their notes.</P>
<P>This valuable bird does not seem to vie with the feathered
inhabitants of that country in the beauty of its plumage, content with
qua∣lifications that endear it to mankind much more. It is but a plain bird to
the eye, about the size of a thrush, of a white and grey colour, and a
reddish bill. It is possessed not only of its own 
<PB N="325" REF="355"/> natural notes, which are musical and solemn, but it
can assume the tone of every other animal in the wood, from the wolf to the
raven. It seems even to sport itself in leading them astray. It will at
one time allure the lesser birds with the call of their males, and then
terrify them when they have come near with the screams of the eagle. There is
no bird in the forest but it can mimick; and there is none that it has not at
times deceived by its call. But, not like such as we usually see famed
for mimicking with us, and who have no particular merit of their own, the mock
bird is ever surest to please when it is most itself. At those
times it usually frequents the houses of the American planters; and,
sitting all night on the chimney-top, pours forth the sweetest and the
most various notes of any bird whatever. It would seem, if accounts be
true, that the deficiency of most other song-birds in that country is made
up by this bird alone. They often build their nests in the fruit-trees about
houses, feed upon berries and other fruits, and are easily rendered
domestic.</P>

<PB N="326" REF="356"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. III. Of the Nightingale and other soft billed
Song-Birds.</HEAD>
<P>THE Nightingale is not only famous among the moderns for its
singing, but almost every one of the ancients who undertook to describe
beautiful nature, has contributed to raise its reputation. 
<Q REND="inline">"The nightingale," says Pliny, "that, for
fifteen days and nights hid in the thickest shades, continues her note
without intermission, deserves our attention and won∣der. How
surprising that so great a voice can reside in so small a body!
such persever∣ance in so minute an animal! With what a musical
propriety are the sounds it produces modulated! The note at one time drawn
out with a long breath, now stealing off into a different cadence, now
interrupted by a break, then changing into a new note by an unexpected
transition, now seeming to renew the same strain, then deceiving
expec∣tation! She sometimes seems to murmur within herself; full, deep,
sharp, swift, drawl∣ing, trembling; now at the top, the middle, and the
bottom of the scale! In short, in <PB N="327" REF="357"/> that little bill
seems to reside all the melody which man has vainly laboured to bring from
a variety of musical instruments. Some even seem to be possessed
of a different song from the rest, and contend with each other with great
ardour. The bird overcome is then seen only to discontinue its song with
its life."</Q></P>
<P>This most famous of the feathered tribe visits England in
the beginning of April, and leaves us in August. It is found but in some of
the southern parts of the country, being totally un∣known in Scotland,
Ireland, or North Wales. They frequent thick hedges and low coppices, and
generally keep in the middle of the bush, so that they are rarely seen.
They begin their song in the evening, and generally continue it for the whole
night. For weeks together, if undisturbed, they sit upon the same tree;
and Shakespear rightly describes the nightingale sitting nightly in the
same place, which I have frequently observed she seldom parts from.</P>
<P>From Pliny's description, we should be led to believe this
bird possessed of a persevering strain; but, though it is in fact
so with the nightingale in Italy, yet in our hedges in Eng∣land, the little
songstress is by no means so li∣beral of her music. Her note is
soft, various, and interrupted; she seldom holds it without a 
<PB N="328" REF="358"/> pause above the time that one can count twenty. The
nightingale's pausing song would be the proper epithet for this bird's
music with us, which is more pleasing than the warbling of any other bird,
because it is heard at a time when all the rest are silent.</P>
<P>In the beginning of May, the nightingale prepares to make its
nest, which is formed of the leaves of trees, straw and moss. The nest
being very eagerly sought after, is as cun∣ningly secreted; so that but
very few of them are found by the boys when they go upon these pursuits. It
is built at the bottom of hedges, where the bushes are thickest and best
covered. While the female continues sitting, the male at a good distance,
but always within hearing, chears the patient hour with his voice, and, by the
short interruption of his song, often gives her warning of approaching
danger. She lays four or five eggs; of which but a part, in our cold climate,
come to maturity.</P>
<P>The delicacy, or rather the fame, of this bird's music, has
induced many to abridge its liberty to be secured of its song. Indeed, the
greatest part of what has been written concern∣ing it in our country,
consists in directions how to manage it for domestic singing; while the
history of the bird is confined to dry receipts <PB N="329" REF="359"/> for
fitting it for the cage. Its song, however, in captivity is not so very
alluring; and the tyranny of taking it from those hedges where only it is
most pleasing, still more de∣preciates its imprisoned efforts. Gesner
as∣sures us, that it is not only the most agreeable songster in a
cage, but that it is possessed of a most admirable faculty of
talking. He tells the following story in proof of his assertion, which he
says was communicated to him by a friend. 
<Q REND="inline">"Whilst I was at Ratisbone," says his
correspondent, "I put up at an inn, the sign of the Golden Crown, where my
host had three nightingales. What I am going to re∣peat is wonderful,
almost incredible, and yet is true. The nightingales were placed
sepa∣rately, so that each was shut up by itself in a dark cage. It
happened at that time, being the spring of the year, when those birds are
wont to sing indefatigably, that I was so af∣flicted with the stone, that
I could sleep but very little all night. It was usual then about midnight,
when there was no noise in the house, but all still, to hear the two
nightin∣gales jangling, and talking with each other, and plainly imitating
men's discourses. For my part I was almost astonished with wonder;
for at this time, when all was quiet else, they <PB N="330" REF="360"/> held
conference together, and repeated what∣ever they had heard among the guests
by day. Those two of them that were most notable, and masters of this
art, were scarce ten foot distant from one another. The third hung more
remote, so that I could not so well hear it as I lay abed. But it is
wonderful to tell how those two provoked each other; and by answering,
invited and drew one another to speak. Yet did they not confound their words,
or talk both together, but rather utter them alternately and of course.
Besides, the daily discourse of the guests, they chanted out two
stories, which generally held them from midnight till morning; and that with
such modulations and inflections, that no man could have taken to come from
such little creatures. When I asked the host if they had been taught, or
whether he ob∣served their talking in the night, he an∣swered, no: the
same said the whole family. But I, who could not sleep for nights
to∣gether, was perfectly sensible of their dis∣course. One of their
stories was concerning the tapster and his wife, who refused to follow
him to the wars as he desired her; for the husband endeavoured to
persuade his wife, as far as I understood by the birds, that he 
<PB N="331" REF="361"/> would leave his service in that inn, and go to the
wars in hopes of plunder. But she refused to follow him, resolving to
stay either at Ratisbone, or go to Nuremberg. There was a long and
earnest contention be∣tween them; and all this dialogue the birds repeated.
They even repeated the unseemly words which were cast out between them, and
which ought rather to have been sup∣pressed and kept a secret. But the
birds, not knowing the difference between modest, immodest, honest and
filthy words, did out with them. The other story was concerning the war which
the emperor was then threat∣ening against the protestants; which the birds
probably heard from some of the gene∣rals that had conferences in the
house. These things did they repeat in the night after twelve o'clock, when
there was a deep silence. But in the day-time, for the most part, they were
silent, and seemed to do nothing but medi∣tate and revolve with
themselves upon what the guests conferred together as they sat at table,
or in their walks. I verily had never believed our Pliny writing so many
wonderful things concerning these little creatures, had I not myself seen
with my eyes, and heard them with my ears uttering such things as I have 
<PB N="332" REF="362"/> related. Neither yet can I of a sudden write all or
call to rememberance every particular that I have heard."</Q></P>
<P>Such is the sagacity ascribed to the nightin∣gale; it is but
to have high reputation for any one quality, and the world is ready enough to
give us fame for others to which we have very small pretensions. But there
is a little bird, ra∣ther celebrated for its affection to mankind than its
singing, which however, in our climate, has the sweetest note of all
others. The reader already perceives that I mean the red-breast, the well
known friend of man, that is found in every hedge, and makes it vocal. The note
of other birds is louder, and their inflections more capricious; but this
bird's voice is soft, tender, and well supported; and the more to be valued
as we enjoy it the greatest part of the winter. If the nightingale's song
has been compared to the fiddle, the red-breast's voice has all the delicacy
of the flute.</P>
<P>The red-breast, during the spring, haunts the wood, the
grove, and the garden; it retires to the thickest and shadiest hedge-rows
to breed in. But in winter it seems to become more domestic, and often to
claim protection from man. Most of the soft billed birds, the nightingale,
the swallow, and the tit-mouse, <PB N="333" REF="363"/> leave us in the
winter, when their insect food is no longer offered in plenty; but the
red-breast continues with us the year round, and endeavours to support the
famine of winter by chirping round the warm habitations of man∣kind, by coming
into those shelters where the rigour of the season is artificially
expelled, and where insects themselves are found in greater numbers,
attracted by the same cause.</P>
<P>This bird breeds differently in different places: in some
countries, its nest is usually found in the crevice of some mossy
bank, or at the foot of an hawthorn in hedge-rows; in others, it chuses the
thickest coverts, and hides its nest with oak leaves. The eggs are from
four to five, of a dull white, with reddish streaks.</P>
<P>The lark, whether the sky lark, the wood, or the tit-lark,
being all distinguishable from other little birds by the length of their
heel, are louder in their song than either of the former, but not so
pleasing. Indeed, the music of every bird in captivity produces no very
pleas∣ing sensations; it is but the mirth of a little animal
insensible of its unfortunate situation; it is the landscape, the
grove, the golden break of day, the contest upon the hawthorn, the fluttering
from branch to branch, the soaring in the air, and the answering of its
young, <PB N="334" REF="364"/> that gives the bird's song its true relish.
These united, improve each other, and raise the mind to a state of the
highest, yet most harmless ex∣ultation. Nothing can in this situation
of mind be more pleasing than to see the lark warbling upon the wing;
raising its note as it soars until it seems lost in the immense
heights above us; the note continuing, the bird itself unseen; to see it
then descending with a swell as it comes from the clouds, yet sinking by
degrees as it approaches its nest, the spot where all its affec∣tions are
centered; the spot that has prompted all this joy.</P>
<P>The lark builds its nest upon the ground, beneath some turf
that serves to hide and shelter it. The female lays four or five eggs, of a
dusky hue in colour, somewhat like those of a plover. It is while she
is sitting that the male thus usually entertains her with his singing;
and while he is risen to an imperceptible height, yet he still has his
loved partner in his eye, nor once loses sight of the nest either while
he ascends or is descending. This harmony continues se∣veral months,
beginning early in the spring on pairing. In winter they assemble in
flocks, when their song forsakes them, and the bird-catchers destroy them
in great numbers for the tables of the luxurious.</P>
<P><PB N="335" REF="365"/>The Black-cap and the Wren, though so
very diminutive, are yet prized by some for their singing. The former is
called by some the mock nightingale; and the latter is admired for the
loudness of its note, compared to the little body from whence it issues.
It must be confessed that this disproportion between the voice of a
bird and its size, in some measure demands our wonder. Quadrupedes in
this respect may be considered as mutes to them. The peacock is louder than
the lion, and the rabbit is not so loud as the wren. But it must be
considered that birds are very differently formed; their lungs in some
measure are ex∣tended through their whole body, while in quadrupedes they lie
only in the breast. In birds there are a variety of cells which take in the
air, and thus pour forth their contents at the little animal's command. The
black-cap and the wren, therefore, are as respectable for their voices as
they might be deemed incon∣siderable for their size.</P>
<P>All these soft billed birds, thus prized for their
singing, are rendered domestic, and brought up with assiduity by such
as are fond of their voices in a cage. The same method of treat∣ment serves
for all, as their food and their habits are nearly the same. The manner of
taking <PB N="336" REF="366"/> and treating them, particularly the nightingale,
is this. A nightingale's nest may be found by observing the place where the
male sings, and then by sticking two or three meal-worms (a kind of maggot
found in flower on some neigh∣bouring thorn, which when he sees he will
in∣fallibly bear away to his young. By listening, he then may be heard with
the female chirping to the young ones while they are feeding. When the nest
is found, if the young ones are not fledged enough to be taken, they must not
be touched with the hands, for then the old ones will perceive it, and entice
them away. They should not be taken till they are almost as full of
feathers as the old ones; and, though they refuse their meat, yet, by opening
their bills, you may give them two or three small bits at a time, which will
make them soon grow tame, when they will feed themselves. They should be
put nest and all into a little basket, which should be covered up warm;
and they should be fed every two hours. Their food should be sheep's
hearts, or other raw flesh meat, chopped very fine, and all the strings,
skins, and fat, taken away. But it should always be mixed with hard hen's
eggs, upon which they will feed and thrive abundantly.</P>
<P>They should then be put in cages like the 
<PB N="337" REF="367"/> nightingale's back cage, with a little straw or dry
moss at the bottom; but when they are grown large they should have ant's
mold. They should be kept very clean, as indeed should all singing-birds
whatsoever; for otherwise they will have the cramp, and perhaps the claws
will drop off. In autumn they will sometimes abstain from their food for a
fortnight, unless two or three meal-worms be given them twice or thrice a
week, or two or three spiders in a day; they must likewise have a little
saffron in their water. Figs chopped small among their meat will help them
to recover their flesh. When their legs are cramped, they should be
anointed with fresh butter, or capon's fat, three or four days together. If
they grow melancholly, put white sugar-candy into their water, and feed them
with sheep's-heart, giving them three or four meal-worms in a day, and a few
ants with their eggs. They should also have saffron in their water.</P>
<P>With regard to adult birds, those that are taken before the
twenty-third of April are ac∣counted the best, because after that they
begin to pair. They usually haunt woods, coppices, and quickset hedges,
where they may be taken in trap cages baited with meal-worms. They should be
placed as near the spot where the <PB N="338" REF="368"/> bird sings as
possible; and before you fix the trap, turn up the earth twice the breadth
of the cage, because they will there look for food. They are also taken
with lime twigs, placing them upon the hedge where they usually sing; and
there should be meal-worms stuck at proper places to draw them into the
snare. After they are taken, their wings should be gently tied with thread,
to prevent their beating themselves against the cage. This should be
first hung in a private place, that the bird may not be di∣sturbed; and it
should be fed every two hours, at farthest, with sheep's-heart and egg
minced very fine, mixing it with meal-worms. How∣ever, the first food must
be worms, ants, ca∣terpillars, and flies. You must, to feed the bird, take it
in your hand, and open the bill with a stick made thick at one end, giving it
the insects, or four or five bits of food as big as peas, to entice it to
eat. Its common food should be mixed with ants, so that when the bird goes
to pick the ants it may pick up some of that also. The nightingale, when
caged, be∣gins to sing about the latter end of November, and continues its
song till June.</P>

<PB N="339" REF="369"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. IV. Of the Canary-bird, and other hard billed
Singing-birds.</HEAD>
<P>THE Canary-bird is now become so common, and has continued
so long in a domestic state, that its native habits, as well as its
native country, seem almost forgotten. Though, by the name, it appears that
these birds came ori∣ginally from the Canary Islands, yet we have it only
from Germany, where they are bred up in great numbers, and sold into
different parts of Europe. At what period they were brought into Europe is not
well known; but it is cer∣tain that about a century ago they were sold at
very high prices, and kept only for the amuse∣ment of the great. They have
since been multiplied in great abundance; and their price is diminished in
proportion to their plenty.</P>
<P>In its native islands, a region equally noted for the beauty
of its landscapes and the harmony of its groves, the canary-bird is of a
dusky grey colour, and so different from those usually seen in
Europe, that some have even doubted whe∣ther it be of the same species.
With us, they have that variety of colouring usual in all do∣mestic 
<PB N="340" REF="370"/> fowls; some white, some mottled, some beautifully
shaded with green; but they are more esteemed for their note than their
beauty, having a high piercing pipe, as indeed all those of the finch tribe
have, continuing for some time in one breath without intermission, then
raising it higher and higher by degrees, with great variety.</P>
<P>It is this that has rendered the canary-bird next to the
nightingale the most celebrated songster; and, as it is more easily
reared than any of the soft billed birds, and continues its song throughout
the year, it is rather the most com∣mon in our houses. Rules, therefore,
have been laid down, and copious instructions given, for breeding these
birds in a domestic state; which, as a part of them may conduce towards the
natural history of the bird, I will take leave to transcribe.</P>
<P>In chusing the canary-bird, those are best that appear
with life and boldness, standing upright upon the perch like a
sparrow-hawk, and not apt to be frighted at every thing that stirs. If its
eyes look chearful, and not drowsy, it is a sign of health; but, on the
contrary, if it hides its head under the wing, and gathers its body up, these
are symptoms of its being out of order. In chusing them the melody of the 
<PB N="341" REF="371"/> song should also be minded: some will open with
the notes of the nightingale, and, run∣ning through a variety of modulations,
end like the tit-lark. Others will begin like the sky-lark; and, by a soft
melodious turn, fall into the notes of the nightingale. These are lessons
taught this bird in its domestic state, and generally taught it by others;
but its na∣tive note is loud, shrill, piercing, and enough to deafen the
hearers. There are persons who admire each of these songs, but the
second is in the most general estimation.</P>
<P>Canary-birds sometimes breed all the year round; but they
most usually begin to pair in April, and to breed in June and August.
Those are said to be the best breeders that are produced between the
English and the French.</P>
<P>Towards the latter end of March, a cock and a hen should be
put together in a small cage, where they will peck at each other in the
beginning, but will soon become thoroughly reconciled. The room where they
are kept to breed should be so situated as to let the birds have the
benefit of the morning sun, and the windows should be of wire, not glass,
that they may enjoy the benefit of the air. The floor of the room should be
kept clean, and sometimes there should be dry gravel or sand sifted
upon <PB N="342" REF="372"/> it. There should also be two windows, one at
each end, and several perches at proper di∣stances for the birds to
settle on, as they fly backwards and forwards. A tree in the middle of the
room would be the most convenient to divert the birds, and sometimes to
serve for building their nests upon.</P>
<P>In Germany they prepare a large room, and build it in the manner
of a barn, being much longer than broad, with a square place at each end, and
several holes to go into those square places. In those outlets they
plant several sorts of trees, in which the birds take great delight to
sing and breed. The bottom of the place they strew with sand, and upon it
cast rape-seed, chick-weed and groundsil, which the old birds feed upon
while breeding. In the body of the house they put all sorts of stuff for
building the nest, and brooms, one under the other, in all the corners, for
the birds to build in. These they separate by partitions from each other,
to prevent those above flying down upon, or otherwise incommoding such as
breed below. The light also is excluded, for no bird is fond of having light
come to its nest.</P>
<P>With us, the apparatus for breeding is less expensive; a
little breeding-cage sometimes suffices, but seldom any thing more
extensive <PB N="343" REF="373"/> than a small room. While the birds are
pairing it is usual to feed them with soft meat; that is, bread,
maw-seed, a little scalded rape-seed, and near a third part of an egg.
The room should be furnished with stuff for making their nests; such
as fine hay, wool, cotton, and hair. These materials should be thoroughly
dry, and then mixed and tied together in such a manner that the birds may
readily pull out what they want. This should be hung in a proper part of the
room, and the male will take his turn in building the nest, sitting upon
the eggs, and feeding the young. They are generally two or three days in
building their nests; the hen commonly lays five eggs; and in the space of
fourteen days the young will be excluded. So prolific are these birds
sometimes that the female will be ready to hatch a second brood before the
first are able to quit the nest. On these occasions, she leaves the
nest and the young to provide herself with another to lay her new brood in.
In the mean time, the male, more faithful to the duties of his trust, breeds
up the young left behind, and fits them for a state of independance.</P>
<P>When the young ones are excluded, the old ones should be
supplied with a sufficiency of soft food every day, with likewise
fresh greens, <PB N="344" REF="374"/> such as cabbage, lettuce, and
chick-weed; in June, shepherd's purse; and in July and Au∣gust, plantane.
They are never to have groundsil after the young are excluded. With these
different delicacies, the old ones will take particular care to feed and bring
up their young; but it is usual when they can feed themselves to be taken
from the nest and put into cages. Their meat then is the yolk of an egg
boiled hard, with an equal quantity of fine bread, and a little scalded
rape-seed: this must be bruised till it becomes fine, and then it may be
mixed with a little maw-seed; after which, blend all together; which is to be
supplied them fresh every day.</P>
<P>The canary-bird, by being kept in company with the linnet or the
gold-finch, pairs and produces a mixed breed, more like the canary-bird, and
resembling it chiefly in its song. Indeed, all this tribe with strong
bills and piercing notes, and feeding upon grain, have the most strong
similitude to each other, and may justly be supposed, as Mr. Buffon
ima∣gines, to come from the same original. They all breed about the same
time; they frequent the same vegetables; they build in the same hedges and
trees; and are brought up for the cage with the same food and precautions.
The linnet, the bull-finch, and the gold-finch, when <PB N="345" REF="375"/> we
know the history of the canary-bird, have scarce any peculiarities that can
attract our curiosity, or require our care. The only art necessary with
all those that have no very fine note is to breed them up under some more
pleasing harmonist. The gold-finch learns a fine song from the
nightingale; and the linnet and bull-finch may be taught, forgetting the wild
notes of nature, to whistle a long and regular tune.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="346" REF="376"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. V. Of the Swallow and its Affinities.</HEAD>
<P>AN idea of any one bird in the former classes will give us
some tolerable conception of the rest. By knowing the linnet, or the
canary-bird, we have some notion of the manners of the gold-finch; by
exhibiting the history of the nightingale, we see also that of the
black-cap or the tit-mouse. But the swallow tribe seems to be entirely
different from all the former: different in their form, different in their
habits, and unlike in all the particulars of their history.</P>
<P>In this tribe is to be found the Goat sucker, which may be
styled a nocturnal swallow: it is the largest of this kind, and is known
by its tail, which is not forked, like that of the com∣mon swallow. It begins
its flight at evening, and makes a loud singular noise, like the whur of a
spinning-wheel. To this also belongs the House-swallow, which is too
well known to need a description: the Martin, inferior in size to the
former, and the tail much less forked; it differs also in its nest, which
is covered at top, while that of the house-swallow is open; and the Swift,
rather larger than the house-swallow, with all the <PB N="347" REF="377"/>
toes standing forward; in which it differs from the rest of its kind. All
these resemble each other so strongly, that it is not without
difficulty the smaller kinds are known asunder.</P>
<P>These are all known by their very large mouths, which, when
they fly, are always kept open; they are not less remarkable for their
short slender feet, which scarce are able to sup∣port the weight of
their bodies; their wings are of immoderate extent for their bulk; their
plumage is glossed with a rich purple; and their note is a slight
twittering, which they seldom exert but upon the wing.</P>
<P>This peculiar conformation seems attended with a similar
peculiarity of manners. Their food is insects, which they always pursue
flying. For this reason, during fine weather, when the insects are most
likely to be abroad, the swal∣lows are for ever upon the wing, and seen
pur∣suing their prey with amazing swiftness and agility. All smaller
animals, in some measure, find safety by winding and turning, when they
endeavour to avoid the greater: the lark thus evades the pursuit of the hawk;
and man the crocodile. In this manner, insects upon the wing endeavour to
avoid the swallow; but this bird is admirably fitted by nature to pursue
them through their shortest turnings. Besides a <PB N="348" REF="378"/>
great length of wing, it is also provided with a long tail, which, like a
rudder, turns it in its most rapid motions; and thus, while it is
pos∣sessed of the greatest swiftness, it is also
possessed of the most extreme agility.</P>
<P>Early, therefore, in the spring, when the returning sun
begins to rouze the insect tribe from their annual state of torpidity, when
the gnat and the beetle put off their earthly robes and venture into air, the
swallow then is seen returning from its long migration beyond the ocean,
and making its way feebly to the shore. At first, with the timidity of a
stranger, it ap∣pears but seldom, and flies but slowly and heavily along.
As the weather grows warmer, and its insect supply encreases, it then
gathers greater strength and activity. But it sometimes happens that a
rainy season, by repelling the insects, stints the swallow in its
food; the poor bird is then seen slowly skimming along the surface of
the ground, and often resting after a flight of a few minutes. In general,
however, it keeps on the wing, and moving with a ra∣pidity that nothing can
escape. When the weather promises to be fair, the insect tribe feel the
genial influence, and make bolder flights; at which time the swallow follows
them in their aerial journeys, and often rises to im∣perceptible 
<PB N="349" REF="379"/> heights in the pursuit. When the weather is likely to
be foul, the insects feel the first notices of it; and from the swallow's
fol∣lowing low we are often apprized of the ap∣proaching change.</P>
<P>When summer is fairly begun, and more than a sufficient
supply for sustaining the wants of nature every where offers, the
swallow then begins to think of forming a progeny. The nest is built with
great industry and art; parti∣cularly by the common swallow, which builds
it on the tops of chimnies. The martin sticks it to the eaves of houses.
The goat-sucker, as we are told, builds it on the bare ground. This nest is
built with mud from some neigh∣bouring brook, well tempered with the bill,
moistened with water for the better adhesion; and still farther kept
firm, by long grass and fibres: within it is lined with goose feathers,
which are ever the warmest and the neatest. The martin covers its nest at
top, and has a door to enter at; the swallow leaves her's quite open. But our
European nests are nothing to be com∣pared with those the swallow builds
on the coasts of China and Coromandel; the description of which I will
give, in the plain honest phrase of Willoughby. 
<Q REND="inline">"On the sea-coast of the kingdom of China,"
says he, "a sort of <PB N="350" REF="380"/> party-coloured birds, of the
shape of swallows, at a certain season of the year, which is their
breeding-time, come out of the mid-land country to the rocks, and from the foam
or froth of the sea-water dashing against the bottom of the rocks, gather
a certain clammy, glutinous matter, perchance the spawn of whales or other
young fishes, of which they build their nests, wherein they lay their eggs
and hatch their young. These nests the Chinese pluck from the rocks, and
bring them, in great numbers, into the East-Indies to sell. They are
esteemed, by gluttons, as great delicacies; who, dissolving them in
chicken or mutton-broth, are very fond of them; far before oysters,
mushrooms, or other dainty and lickorish morsels."</Q> What a pity this
luxury hath not been introduced among us; and then our great feasters might
be enabled to eat a little more!</P>
<P>The swallow usually lays from five to six eggs, of a white
colour, speckled with red; and sometimes breeds twice a year. When the
young brood are excluded, the swallow supplies them very plentifully, the
first brood particularly, when she finds herself capable of producing two
broods in a year. This happens when the parents come early, when the season
is peculiarly mild, <PB N="351" REF="381"/> and when they begin to pair soon.
Sometimes they find a difficulty in rearing even a single nest,
particularly when the weather has been severe, or their nests have been
robbed in the beginning of the season. By these accidents, this
im∣portant task is sometimes deferred to the middle of September.</P>
<P>At the latter end of September they leave us; and for a few days
previous to their de∣parture, assemble, in vast flocks, on house-tops,
as if deliberating on the fatiguing journey that lay before them. This is no
slight under∣taking, as their flight is directed to Congo, Senegal, and along
the whole Morocco shore. There are some, however, left behind in this
general expedition, that do not part till eight or ten days after the rest.
These are chiefly the latter weakly broods, which are not yet in a condition
to set out. They are some∣times even too feeble to venture, till the
setting in of winter; while their parents vainly exhort them to efforts which
instinct assures them they are incapable of performing. Thus it often
happens, that the wretched little families, being compelled to stay, perish
the first cold weather that comes; while the tender parents share the fate
of their offspring, and die with their new-fledged brood.</P>
<P><PB N="352" REF="382"/>Those that migrate, are first
observed to arrive in Africa, as Mr. Adanson assures us, about the
beginning of October. They are thought to have performed their fatiguing
journey in the space of seven days. They are sometimes seen, when
interrupted by contrary winds, wavering in their course far off at sea, and
lighting upon whatever ship they find in their passage. They then seem
spent with famine and fatigue; yet still they boldly venture, when
refreshed by a few hours rest, to renew their flight, and continue the
course which they had been steering before.</P>
<P>These are facts, proved by incontestible au∣thority; yet it
is a doubt whether all swallows migrate in this manner, or whether there may
not be some species of this animal that, though externally alike, are so
internally different, as to be very differently affected by the approach of
winter. We are assured, from many, and these not contemptible
witnesses, that swallows hide themselves in holes under ground, joined
close together, bill against bill, and feet against feet. Some inform us
that they have seen them taken out of the water, and even from under the ice,
in bunches, where they are asserted to pass the winter without motion.
Reaumur, who particularly interested himself in this en∣quiry, 
<PB N="353" REF="383"/> received several accounts of bundles of swallows
being thus found in quarries and under the water. These men, therefore, have
a right to some degree of assent; and are not to lose all credit from
our ignorance of what they aver.</P>
<P>All, however, that we have hitherto dissected, are formed
within like other birds; and seem to offer no observable variety. Indeed,
that they do not hide themselves under water, has been pretty well proved, by
the noted experiment of Frisch, who tied several threads died in
water-colours, round the legs of a great number of swallows, that were
preparing for their de∣parture: these, upon their return the ensuing
summer, brought their threads back with them, no way damaged in their colour;
which they most certainly would, if, during the winter, they had been
steeped in water: yet still this is a subject on which we must
suspend our assent, as Klein, the naturalist, has brought such a
number of proofs, in defence of his opinion, that swallows are torpid in
winter, as even the most incredulous must allow to have some degree of
probability.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="6" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="354" REF="384"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. VI. Of the Humming-bird and its Varieties.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING given some history of the manners of the most
remarkable birds of which accounts can be obtained, I might now go to a very
ex∣tensive tribe, remarkable for the splendour and the variety of their
plumage: but the descrip∣tion of the colours of a beautiful bird, has
no∣thing in it that can inform or entertain; it rather excites a longing, which
it is impossible for words to satisfy. Naturalists, indeed, have
endeavoured to satisfy this desire, by coloured prints; but, beside that
these at best give only a faint resemblance of nature, and are a very
indifferent kind of painting, the bird itself has a thousand beauties, that
the most exquisite artist is incapable of imitating. They, for
instance, who imagine they have a complete idea of the beauty of the little
tribe of Manikin birds, from the pictures we have of them, will find
themselves deceived, when they compare their draughts with nature. The
shining greens, the changeable purples, and the glossy reds, are beyond
the reach of the pencil; and very far beyond the coloured print, which is but a
<PB N="355" REF="385"/> poor substitute to painting. I have therefore
declined entering into a minute description of foreign birds of the sparrow
kind; as sounds would never convey an adequate idea of colours.</P>
<P>There is one species, however, that I will conclude the
history of this class with; as, though the least, it will certainly be
allowed the most beautiful of all others. In quadrupedes, the smallest
animals are noxious, ugly and loathsome; the smallest of birds are the
most beautiful, innocent and sportive. Of all those that flutter in the
garden, or paint the land∣scape, the Humming-bird is the most delightful to
look upon, and the most inoffensive.</P>
<P>Of this charming little animal, there are six or seven
varieties, from the size of a small wren, down to that of an humble-bee. An
European could never have supposed a bird existing so very small, and
yet completely fur∣nished out with a bill, feathers, wings, and
in∣testines, exactly resembling those of the largest kind. A bird not
so big as the end of one's little finger, would probably be supposed but
a creature of imagination, were it not seen in in∣finite numbers, and as
frequent as butterflies in a summer's day, sporting in the fields of
Ame∣rica, from flower to flower, and extracting their sweets with its little
bill.</P>
<P><PB N="356" REF="386"/>The smallest humming-bird is about the
size of an hazel-nut. The feathers on its wings and tail are black; but
those on its body, and under its wings, are of a greenish brown, with a
fine red cast or gloss, which no silk or velvet can imitate. It has a
small crest on its head, green at the bottom, and as it were gilded at the
top; and which sparkles in the sun like a little star in the middle of
its forehead. The bill is black, straight, slender, and of the length of a
small pin. The larger humming-bird is near half as big as the common wren,
and without a crest on its head; but, to make amends, it is covered, from the
throat half way down the belly, with changeable crimson coloured feathers,
that, in different lights, change to a variety of beautiful colours, much like
an opal. The heads of both are small, with very little round eyes as black as
jet.</P>
<P>It is inconceivable how much these add to the high finishing
and beauty of a rich luxurious western landscape. As soon as the sun is
risen, the humming-birds, of different kinds, are seen fluttering about the
flowers, without ever lighting upon them. Their wings are in such rapid
motion, that it is impossible to discern their colours, except by their
glittering. They <PB N="357" REF="387"/> are never still, but continually in
motion, vi∣siting flower after flower, and extracting its honey as if with a
kiss. For this purpose they are furnished with a forky tongue, that
enters the cup of the flower and extracts its nectared tribute. Upon this alone
they subsist. The rapid motion of their wings brings out an hum∣ming
sound, from whence they have their name; for whatever divides the air
swiftly, must thus produce a murmur.</P>
<P>The nests of these birds are not less curious than the
rest: they are suspended in the air, at the point of the twigs of an
orange, a pome∣granate, or a citron-tree; sometimes even in houses, if they
find a small and convenient twig for the purpose. The female is the
architect, while the male goes in quest of materials; such as cotton, fine
moss, and the fibres of vege∣tables. Of these materials a nest is
composed, of about the size of an hen's egg cut in two, admirably
contrived, and warmly lined with cotton. They lay two eggs at a time, and never
more, about the size of small peas, and as white as snow, with here and
there a yellow speck. The male and the female sit upon the nest by turns;
but the female takes to herself the greatest share. She seldom quits
the nest, except a few minutes in the morning and <PB N="358" REF="388"/>
evening, when the dew is upon the flowers and their honey in perfection. During
this short interval, the male takes her place; for, as the egg is so
small, the exposing it ever so short a time to the weather, would be
apt to injure its contents, the surface exposed being so great in
comparison to the bulk. The time of incubation continues twelve days; at the
end of which the young ones appear, much about the size of a blue-bottle fly.
They are at first bare; by degrees they are covered with down; and, at
last, feathers succeed, but less beautiful at first than those of the
old ones.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"Father Labat's companion, in the mission to
America, found the nest of an humming-bird, in a shed that was near the
dwelling-house, and took it in, at a time when the young ones were about
fifteen or twenty days old; he then placed them in a cage at his chamber
window, to be amused by their sportive flutterings; but he was soon
sur∣prized to see the old ones, that came and fed their brood regularly
every hour in the day. By these means they themselves soon grew so tame
that they seldom quitted the chamber; but, without any constraint, came to
live with their young ones. All four have fre∣quently come to perch upon their
master's <PB N="359" REF="389"/> hand, chirruping as if they had been at
liberty abroad. He fed them with a very fine clear paste, made of wine,
biscuit and sugar. They thrust their tongues into this paste, till they
were satisfied, and then fluttered and chirruped about the room. I never
beheld any thing more agreeable," continues he, "than this lovely little
family, that had taken possession of my companion's chamber, and that
flew out and in just as they thought proper; but were ever attentive to the
voice of their master, when he called them. In this manner they lived with
him for above six months; but, at a time when he expected to see a new
colony formed, he unfortunately forgot to tie up their cage to the cieling at
night, to preserve them from the rats, and he found they were devoured in the
morn∣ing."</Q></P>
<P>These birds, on the continent of America, continue to flutter
the year round; as their food, which is the honey of flowers, never forsakes
them in those warm latitudes where they are found. But it is otherwise in
the islands of the Antilles, where, when the winter season approaches,
they retire, and, as some say, continue in a torpid state during the
seve∣rity of that season. At Surinam and Jamaica, <PB N="360" REF="390"/>
where they constantly have flowers, these beau∣tiful birds are never known
to disappear.</P>
<P>It is a doubt whether or not these birds have a continued note
in singing. All travellers agree that, beside the humming noise produced
by their wings, they have a little interrupted chirrup; but Labat asserts,
that they have a most pleasing melancholy melody in their voices, though
small and proportioned to the organs which produce it. It is very probable
that, in different places, their notes are also different; and as there are
some that continue torpid all the winter, there may likewise be some with
agree∣able voices, though the rest may in general be silent.</P>
<P>The Indians formerly made great use of this pretty bird's
plumage, in adorning their belts and head-dress. The children take them in
the fields upon rings smeared with bird-lime: they approach the place where
the birds are flying, and twirling their rings in the air, so allure them,
either by the colour or the sound, that the simple little creature comes to
rest upon the ring, and is seized. They are then instantly killed and
gutted, and hung up in the chimney to dry. Those who take greater care, dry
them in a stove, which is not so likely to injure the plumage as the
foregoing method. Their <PB N="361" REF="391"/> beautiful feathers were once the
ornament of the highest rank of savage nobility: but at pre∣sent, they
take the bird rather for the purpose of selling it as a curiosity to the
Europeans, than that of ornament for themselves. All the taste for savage
finery is wearing out fast, even among the Americans. They now begin to
adopt, if not the dresses of Europe, at least the materials of which they
are composed. The wandering warrior is far from thinking himself fine at
present with his bow and his feathered crown: his ambition reaches to higher
orna∣ments; a gun, a blue shirt and a blanket.</P>

<HEAD>PART V. OF BIRDS OF THE CRANE KIND.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="365" REF="393"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. I. Of Birds of the Crane Kind in General.</HEAD>
<P>THE progressions of Nature from one class of beings to
another, are always by slow and almost imperceptible degrees. She has
peopled the woods and the fields with a variety of the most beautiful birds;
and, to leave no part of her extensive territories untenanted, she has
stocked the waters with its feathered inha∣bitants also: she has taken
the same care in pro∣viding for the wants of her animals in this ele∣ment, as
she has done with respect to those of the other: she has used as much
precaution to render water-fowl fit for swimming, as she did in forming
land-fowl for flight: she has defended their feathers with a natural oil, and
united their toes by a webbed membrane; by which contrivances they have at once
security and motion. But between the classes of land-birds that shun
the water, and of water-fowl that are made for swimming and living on it,
she has formed a very numerous tribe of birds, that seem to partake of a
middle nature; that, with divided toes, seemingly fitted to live upon land,
are at the same time furnished with appe∣tites <PB N="366" REF="394"/> that
chiefly attach them to the waters. These can properly be called neither
land-birds nor water-fowl, as they provide all their suste∣nance from
watery places, and yet are unqua∣lified to seek it in those depths where it
is often found in greatest plenty.</P>
<P>This class of birds, of the crane kind, are to be
distinguished from others rather by their appetites than their
conformation. Yet even in this respect they seem to be sufficiently
dis∣criminated by Nature: as they are to live among the waters, yet are
incapable of swim∣ming in them, most of them have long legs, fitted for
wading in shallow waters, or long bills proper for groping in them.</P>
<P>Every bird of this kind, habituated to marshy places, may be
known, if not by the length of its legs, at least by the scaly surface of
them. Those who have observed the legs of a snipe or a woodcock, will
easily perceive my meaning; and how different the surface of the skin
that covers them is from that of the pigeon or the partridge. Most birds of
this kind also, are bare of feathers half way up the thigh; at least, in
all of them, above the knee. Their long habits of wading in the waters, and
having their legs continually in moisture, prevents the growth of feathers on
those parts; so that there is a sur∣prizing <PB N="367" REF="395"/>
difference between the leg of a crane, naked of feathers almost up to the
body, and the falcon, booted almost to the very toes.</P>
<P>The bill also is very distinguishable in most of this
class. It is, in general, longer than that of other birds, and in some
finely fluted on every side; while at the point it is possessed of
extreme sensibility, and furnished with nerves, for the better feeling
their food at the bottom of marshes, where it cannot be seen. Some birds of
this class are thus fitted with every con∣venience: they have long legs, for
wading; long necks, for stooping; long bills, for search∣ing; and nervous
points, for feeling. Others are not so amply provided for; as some have
long bills, but legs of no great length; and others have long necks, but very
short legs. It is a rule which universally holds, that where the bird's
legs are long, the neck is also long in proportion. It would indeed be an
in∣curable defect in the bird's conformation, to be lifted upon stilts above
its food, without being furnished with an instrument to reach it.</P>
<P>If we consider the natural power of this class, in a
comparative view, they will seem rather inferior to those of every other
tribe. Their nests are more simple than those of the sparrow; and their
methods of obtaining food less inge∣nious <PB N="368" REF="396"/> than those
of the falcon: the pie exceeds them in cunning; and though they have all the
voraciousness of the poultry tribe; they want their fecundity. None of this
kind, therefore, have been taken into man's society, or under his protection;
they are neither caged, like the nightingale; nor kept tame, like the turkey;
but lead a life of precarious liberty, in fens and marshes, at the edges of
lakes, and along the sea-shore. They all live upon fish or insects, one
or two only excepted; even those that are called mudsuckers, such as the
snipe and the woodcock, it is more than probable, grope the bottom of
marshy places only for such insects as are deposited there by their
kind, and live in a vermicular state, in pools and plashes, till they take
wing, and become flying insects.</P>
<P>All this class, therefore, that are fed upon insects, their
food being easily digestible, are good to be eaten; while those who live
entirely upon fish, abounding in oil, acquire in their flesh the rancidity
of their diet, and are, in ge∣neral, unfit for our tables. To savages indeed,
and sailors on a long voyage, every thing that has life seems good to be
eaten; and we often find them recommending those animals as dain∣ties, which
they themselves would spurn at, after a course of good living. Nothing is
more <PB N="369" REF="397"/> common in their journals than such accounts as
these—
<Q REND="inline">"This day we shot a fox—pretty good
eating: this day we shot a heron—pretty good eating: and this day we
killed a turtle—which they rank with the heron and the fox, as pretty
good eating."</Q> Their accounts, there∣fore, of the flesh of these birds,
are not to be depended upon; and when they cry up the heron or the stork of
other countries as luxurious food, we must always attend to the state of
their appetites who give the character.</P>
<P>In treating of this class of birds, it will be best to
observe the simplest method possible; neither to load the memory with
numerous di∣stinctions, nor yet confuse the imagination, by a total want of
arrangement. I will therefore describe some of the larger sorts
separately; as in an history of birds, each of these demands peculiar
distinction. The crane, the stork, the Ballearic crane, the heron, the
bittern, with some others, may require a separate history. Some
particular tribes may next offer, that may very naturally be classed
together: and as for all the smaller and least remarkable sorts, they may
be grouped into one general description.</P>

<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="370" REF="398"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. II. The Crane.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is something extraordinary in the different accounts we
have of this bird's size and dimensions. Willoughby and Penant make the
Crane from five to six feet long, from the tip to the tail. Other accounts
say, that it is above five feet high; and others, that it is as tall as a
man. From the many which I myself had seen, I own this imputed magnitude
surprized me; as from memory I was convinced, they could neither be so long
nor so tall. Indeed, a bird, the body of which is not larger than that of a
turkey-hen, and acknowledged on all hands not to weigh above ten pounds, cannot
easily be supposed to be almost as long as an ostrich. Brisson,
however, seems to give this bird its real dimensions, when he describes
it as something less than the brown stork, about three feet high, and
about four from the tip to the tail. Still, however, the numerous
testi∣monies of its superior size are not to be totally rejected; and
perhaps, that from which Brisson took his dimensions, was one of the
smallest of the kind.</P>
<P><PB N="371" REF="399"/>The crane, taking its dimensions from
him, is exactly three feet four inches from the tip to the tail, and four feet
from the head to the toe. It is a tall, slender bird, with a long neck and
long legs. The top of the head is covered with black bristles, and the back
of it is bald and red, which sufficiently distinguishes this bird from
the stork, to which it is very nearly allied in size and figure. The
plumage, in general, is ash-coloured; and there are two large tufts of
feathers, that spring from the pinion of each wing. These bear a
resemblance to hair, and are finely curled at the ends, which the bird has a
power of erecting and depressing at pleasure. Gesner says, that
these feathers, in his time, used to be set in gold, and worn as
ornaments in caps.</P>
<P>Such are the dimensions of a bird, concerning which, not to
mention modern times, there have been more fables propagated than of any other.
It is a bird with which all the antient writers are familiar; and, in
describing it, they have not failed to mix imagination with history. From
the policy of the cranes, they say, we are to look for an idea of the most
perfect republic amongst ourselves; from their tender∣ness to their
decrepid parents, which they take care to nourish, to cherish, and
support when <PB N="372" REF="400"/> flying, we are to learn lessons of
filial piety; but particularly from their conduct in fighting with the pigmies
of Ethiopia, we are to receive our maxims in the art of war. In early times,
the history of nature fell to the lot of poets only, and certainly none could
describe it so well; but it is a part of their province to embellish
also; and when this agreeable science was claimed by a more sober class
of people, they were obliged to take the accounts of things as they found them;
and, in the present instance, fable ran down blended with truth to
posterity.</P>
<P>In these accounts, therefore, there is some foundation of
truth; yet much more has been added by fancy. The crane is certainly a very
social bird, and they are seldom seen alone. Their usual method of
flying or sitting, is in flocks of fifty or sixty together; and while a
part feed, the rest stand like centinels upon duty. The fable of their
supporting their aged parents, may have arisen from their strict
connubial affection; and as for their fighting with the pigmies, it may not be
improbable but that they have boldly withstood the invasions of monkies
coming to rob their nests; for, in this case, as the crane lives upon
vegetables, it is not probable that it would be the first aggressor.</P>
<P>However this be, the crane is a wandering, <PB N="373" REF="401"/> sociable bird, that, for the most part, subsists upon
vegetables; and is known in every country of Europe, except our own. There is
no part of the world, says Belonius, where the fields are cultivated, that
the crane does not come in with the husbandman for a share in the
har∣vest. As they are birds of passage, they are seen to depart and
return regularly at those seasons when their provision invites or
repels them. They generally leave Europe about the latter end of autumn, and
return in the beginning of summer. In the inland parts of the continent, they
are seen crossing the country, in flocks of fifty or an hundred, making
from the northern regions towards the south. In these migra∣tions, however,
they are not so resolutely bent upon going forward, but that if a field of
corn offers in their way, they will stop a while to re∣gale upon it: on
such occasions they do incre∣dible damage, chiefly in the night; and the
husbandman, who lay down in joyful expec∣tation, rises in the morning to
see his fields laid entirely waste, by an enemy, whose march is too
swift for his vengeance to overtake.</P>
<P>Our own country is free from their visits; not but that they
were formerly known in this island, and held in great estimation, for the
de∣licacy of their flesh: there was even a penalty <PB N="374" REF="402"/>
upon such as destroyed their eggs; but, at present, they never go so
far out of their way. Cultivation and populousness go hand in hand; and
though our fields may offer them a greater plenty, yet it is so guarded, that
the birds find the venture greater than the enjoyment; and probably we are much
better off by their absence than their company. Whatever their flesh might
once have been, when, as Plutarch tells us, cranes were blinded and kept in
coops, to be fattened for the tables of the great in Rome; or, as they were
brought up, stuffed with mint and rue, to the tables of our nobles at home;
at present, they are considered all over Europe as wretched eating. The
flesh is fibrous and dry, requiring much preparation to make it palatable;
and even after every art, it is fit only for the stomachs of strong and
labouring people.</P>
<P>The cold Artic region seems to be this bird's favourite abode.
They come down into the more southern parts of Europe, rather as visit∣ants
than inhabitants: yet it is not well known in what manner they portion out
their time, to the different parts of the world. The migra∣tions of the
fieldfare or thrush, are obvious, and well known; they go northward or
southward, in one simple track; when their food fails them here, they have
but one region to go to. But <PB N="375" REF="403"/> it is otherwise with the
crane; he changes place, like a wanderer: he spends the autumn in Europe; he
then flies off, probably to some more southern climate, to enjoy a part of
the winter; returns to Europe in the spring; crosses up to the north in
summer; visits those lakes that are never dry; and then comes down again,
to make depredations upon our cultivated grounds, in autumn. Thus, Gesner
assures us, that the cranes usually began to quit Germany, from about the
eleventh of September to the seven∣teenth of October; from thence they were
seen flying southward by thousands; and Redi tells us, they arrive in
Tuscany a short time after. There they tear up the fields, newly sown,
for the grain just committed to the ground, and do great mischief. It is to
be supposed that, in the severity of winter, they go southward, still
nearer the line. They again appear in the fields of Pisa, regularly about the
twentieth of February, to anticipate the spring.</P>
<P>In these journeys it is amazing to conceive the heights to
which they ascend, when they fly. Their note is the loudest of all other
birds; and that is often heard in the clouds, when the bird itself is
entirely unseen. As it is light for its size, and spreads a large
expanse of wing, it is capable of floating, at the greatest height, 
<PB N="376" REF="404"/> where the air is lightest; and as it secures its
safety, and is entirely out of the reach of man, it flies in tracts which
would be too fatiguing for any other birds to move forward in.</P>
<P>In these aerial journeys, though unseen themselves, they
have the distinctest vision of every object below. They govern and direct
their flight by their cries; and exhort each other to proceed or to descend,
when a fit op∣portunity offers for depredation. Their voice, as was observed,
is the loudest of all the fea∣thered tribe; and its peculiar clangor arises
from the very extraordinary length and contortion of the windpipe. In
quadrupedes, the windpipe is short, and the glottis, or cartilages that form
the voice, are at that end of it which is next the mouth: in water fowl the
windpipe is longer, but the cartilages that form the voice are at the other
end, which lies down in their belly. By this means they have much louder
voices, in proportion to their size, than any other animals whatever; for the
note, when formed below, is reverberated through all the rings of the windpipe,
till it reaches the air. But the voice of the duck or the goose, is no∣thing
to be compared to that of the crane, whose windpipe is not only made in the
same manner with theirs, but is above twenty times <PB N="377" REF="405"/> as
long. Nature seems to have bestowed much pains in lengthening out this
organ. From the outside, it enters through the flesh into the
breast-bone, which hath a great cavity within to receive it. There, being
thrice reflected, it goes out again at the same hole, and so turns down to
the lungs, and thus enters the body a second time. The loud clangorous
sound which the bird is thus enabled to produce, is, when near, almost
deafening: however, it is particularly serviceable to the animal itself,
ei∣ther during its migrations or its stay: by it the flock is encouraged in
their journies; and if, while they are feeding, which is usually performed in
profound silence, they are invaded on any side, the bird that first
perceives the danger, is sure to sound the alarm, and all are speedily
upon the wing.</P>
<P>As they rise but heavily, they are very shy birds, and
seldom let the fowler approach them. Their depredations are usually made in
the darkest nights; at which time they enter a field of corn, and trample it
down, as if it had been crossed over by a regiment of men. On other
occasions, they chuse some extensive solitary marsh, where they
range themselves all day, as if they were in deliberation; and not having 
<PB N="378" REF="406"/> that grain which is most to their appetites, wade the
marshes, for insects, and other food, which they can procure with less
danger.</P>
<P>Corn is their favourite food; but there is scarce any other
that comes amiss to them. Redi, who opened several, found the stomach of
one full of the herb called dandelion; that of another was filled with beans; a
third had a great quantity of clover in its stomach; while that of two others
was filled with earth-worms and beetles: in some he found lizards and
sea-fish; in others, snails, grass, and pebbles, swal∣lowed perhaps
for medicinal purposes. It seems, therefore, that these birds are
easily supplied; and that they are noxious to corn-fields but on some
particular occasions.</P>
<P>In general it is a peaceful bird, both in its own society, and
with respect to those of the forest. Though so large in appearance, a
little falcon pursues, and often disables it. The method is, with those
who are fond of hawk∣ing, to fly several hawks together against it; which
the crane endeavours to avoid, by flying up perpendicularly, till the air
becomes too thin to support it any higher. The hawk, however, still bears
it company; and though less fitted for floating in so thin a medium, yet, 
<PB N="379" REF="407"/> possessed of greater rapidity, it still gains
the ascendency. They both often rise out of sight; but soon the
spectator, who keeps his eye fixed above, perceives them, like two specks,
be∣ginning to appear: they gather on his eye for a little space, and
shortly after come tumbling per∣pendicularly together, with great animosity
on the side of the hawk, and a loud screaming on that of the crane. Thus
driven to extremity, and unable to fly, the poor animal throws itself upon
its back, and, in that situation, makes a most desperate defence, till
the sportsman coming up, generally puts an end to the contest with its
life.</P>
<P>It was once the barbarous custom to breed up cranes to be thus
baited; and young ones were taken from the nest, to be trained up for this
cruel diversion. It is an animal easily tamed; and, if we can believe
Albertus Mag∣nus, has a particular affection for man. This quality, however,
was not sufficient to guard it from being made the victim of his fierce
amusements. The female, which is easily distinguished from the male, by
not being bald behind as he is, never lays above two eggs at a time; being like
those of a goose, but of a bluish colour. The young ones are soon fit
to <PB N="380" REF="408"/> fly, and then the parents forsake them to shift
for themselves; but, before this time, they are led forth to the places where
their food is most easily found. Though yet unfledged, they run with such
swiftness that a man cannot easily overtake them. We are told, that as
they grow old, their plumage becomes darker; and, as a proof of their
longevity, Aldrovandus assures us, that a friend of his kept one tame for
above forty years.</P>
<P>Whatever may have been the disposition of the great, the
vulgar of every country, to this day, bear the crane a compassionate
regard. It is possible the antient prejudices in its favour, which once
having been planted, are eradicated but slowly, may still continue to
operate. In some countries, it is considered as an heinous offence to kill
a crane; and though the legisla∣ture declines to punish, yet the people do
not fail to resent, the injury. The crane, they, in some measure,
consider as the prophet of the season: upon its approach or delay they
regu∣late the periods of their rural oeconomy. If their favourite bird comes
early in the season, they expect a plentiful summer; if he is slow in
his visits, they then prepare for an unfa∣vourable spring. Whatever
wisdom there may <PB N="381" REF="409"/> be in despising the prejudices of
the vulgar, there is but little in condemning them. They have generally had
their origin in good motives; and it should never be our endeavours to
sup∣press any tender emotions of friendship or pity, in those hard
breasts that are, in general, un∣susceptible of either.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="382" REF="410"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. III. The Stork.</HEAD>
<P>IF we regard the Stork externally only, we shall be very apt
to confound it with the crane. It is of the same size; it has the same
formation as to the bill, neck, legs, and body, except that it is something
more corpulent. Its differ∣ences are but very slight; such as the colour,
which in the crane is ash and black, but in the stork is white and brown.
The nails of the toes of the stork also are very peculiar; not being clawed
like those of other birds, but flat like the nails of a man.</P>
<P>These, however, are but very slight differ∣ences; and its
true distinctions are to be taken rather from its manners than its form. The
crane has a loud piercing voice; the stork is silent, and produces no other
noise than the clacking of its under chap against the upper: the crane has
a strange convolution of the wind-pipe through the breast-bone; the
stork's is formed in the usual manner: the crane feeds mostly upon
vegetables and grain; the stork preys entirely upon frogs, fishes, birds,
and serpents: the crane avoids towns and po∣pulous <PB N="383" REF="411"/>
places; the stork lives always in or near them: the crane lays but two eggs,
and the stork generally four. These are distinc∣tions fully sufficient
to mark the species, not∣withstanding the similitude of their form.</P>
<P>Storks are birds of passage, like the former; but it is hard
to say whence they come or whi∣ther they go. When they withdraw from Eu∣rope,
they all assemble on a particular day, and never leave one of their company
behind them. They take their flight in the night; which is the reason the way
they go has never been ob∣served. They generally return into Europe in the
middle of March, and make their nests on the tops of chimnies and houses as
well as of high trees. The females lay from two to four eggs, of the size and
colour of those of geese; and the male and female sit upon them by turns.
They are a month in hatching; and when their young are excluded, they are
parti∣cularly solicitous for their safety.</P>
<P>As the food of these birds consists in a great measure
of frogs and serpents, it is not to be wondered at that different nations
have paid them a particular veneration. The Dutch are very solicitous for the
preservation of the stork in every part of their republic. This bird
seems to have taken refuge among their towns; and <PB N="384" REF="412"/>
builds on the tops of their houses without any molestation. There it is
seen resting familiarly in their streets, and protected as well by the
laws as the prejudices of the people. They have even got an opinion that it
will only live in a republic; and that story of its filial piety, first
falsely propagated of the crane, has in part been ascribed to the stork.
But it is not in re∣publics alone that the stork is seen to reside, as
there are few towns on the continent, in low marshy situations, but have
the stork as an inmate among them; as well the despotic princes of Germany
as the little republics of Italy.</P>
<P>The stork seems a general favourite even among the moderns;
but with the antient Egyptians their regard was carried even to ado∣ration.
This enlightened people, who wor∣shipped the Deity in his creatures, paid
divine honours to the ibis, as is universally known. It has been usually
supposed that the antient ibis is the same with that which goes at
present by the same name; a bird of the stork kind, of about the size
of a curlew, all over black, with a bill very thick in the beginning, but
ending in a point for the better seizing its prey, which is caterpillars,
locusts, and serpents. But, however useful the modern ibis may be in
ridding Egypt, where it resides, of the vermin <PB N="385" REF="413"/> and
venemous animals that infest it; yet it is much doubted whether this be the
same ibis to which the ancients paid their adoration. Mail∣let, the French
consul at Cairo, observes, that it is very hard to determine what bird the
an∣cient ibis certainly was, because there are cranes, storks, hawks,
kites, and falcons, that are all equally enemies to serpents, and devour a
vast number. He farther adds, that in the months of May, when the winds begin
to blow from the internal parts of Africa, there are several sorts of birds
that come down from Upper Egypt, from whence they are driven by the rains, in
search of a better habitation, and that it is then they do this country
such signal ser∣vices. Nor does the figure of this bird hierogli∣phically
represented on their pillars mark it sufficiently to make the
distinction. Besides, the modern ibis is not peculiar to Egypt, as it is to
be seen but at certain seasons of the year; whereas we are informed by
Pliny, that this bird was seen no where else. It is thought, therefore,
that the true ibis is a bird of the vul∣ture kind, described above, and
called by some the capon of Pharaoh, which not only is a de∣vourer of
serpents, but will follow the caravans that go to Mecca, to feed upon the
offal of the animals that are killed on the journey.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. Of the Balearic and other foreign Cranes.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING ended the last chapter with doubts concerning the ibis,
we shall begin this with doubts concerning the Balearic Crane. Pliny has
described a bird of the crane-kind with a topping resembling that of the
green wood-pecker. This bird for a long time continued unknown till we became
acquainted with the birds of tropical climates, when one of the crane-kind with
a topping was brought into Europe, and described by Aldrovandus as Pliny's
Balearic Crane. Hence these birds, which have since been brought from
Africa and the East in numbers, have received the name of Balearic Cranes,
but without any just foundation. The real Balearic Crane of Pliny seems to
be the lesser ash-coloured heron, with a topping of narrow white
feathers, or perhaps the egret, with two long feathers that fall back from the
sides of the head. The bird that we are about to describe under the name of
the Balearic Crane was unknown to the ancients; and the heron or egret ought to
be reinstated in their just title to that name.</P>

<P><PB N="387" REF="418"/>When we see a very extraordinary animal,
we are naturally led to suppose that there must be something also
remarkable in its history to correspond with the singularity of its
figure. But it often happens that history fails on those occasions where
we most desire informa∣tion. In the present instance, in particular, no
bird presents to the eye a more whimsical figure than this, which we must
be content to call the Balearic Crane. It is pretty nearly of the shape and
size of the ordinary crane, with long legs and a long neck, like others of
the kind; but the bill is shorter, and the colour of the feathers of a dark
greenish grey. The head and throat form the most striking part of this
bird's figure. On the head is seen standing up, a thick round crest, made
of bristles, spreading every way, and resembling rays standing out in
different directions. The longest of these rays are about three inches and
an half; and they are all topped with a kind of black tassels, which give
them a beautiful appearance. The sides of the head and cheeks are bare,
whitish, and edged with red, while underneath the throat hangs a kind of bag
or wattle, like that of a cock, but not divided into two. To give this odd
composition a higher finishing, the eye is large and staring; the pupil
black and big, <PB N="388" REF="419"/> surrounded with a gold-coloured iris
that com∣pletes the bird's very singular appearance.</P>
<P>From such a peculiar figure, we might be led to wish for a
minute history of its manners; but of these we can give but slight
information. This bird comes from the coast of Africa and the Cape de Verd
Islands. As it runs, it stretches out its wings, and goes very swiftly,
otherwise its usual motion is very slow. In their domestic state,
they walk very deliberately among other poultry, and suffer themselves to
be approached (at least it was so with that I saw) by every spectator.
They never roost in houses but about night: when they are disposed to
go to rest, they search out some high wall, on which they pearch in the
manner of a peacock. Indeed, they so much resemble that bird in manners and
disposition, that some have de∣scribed them by the name of the
sea-peacock; and Ray has been inclined to rank them in the same family.
But, though their voice and roosting be similar, their food, which is
entirely upon greens, vegetables, and barley, seems to make some
difference.</P>
<P>In this chapter of foreign birds of the crane-kind, it will be
proper to mention the Jabiru and the Jabiru Guacu, both natives of Brasil. Of
these great birds of the crane-kind we know <PB N="389" REF="420"/> but
little, except the general out-line of their figure, and the enormous bills
which we often see preserved in the cabinets of the curious. The bill of
the latter is red, and thirteen inches long; the bill of the former is black,
and is found to be eleven. Neither of them, however, are of a size
proportioned to their immoderate length of bill. The jabiru guacu is not above
the size of a common stork, while the jabiru with the smallest bill
exceeds the size of a swan. They are both covered with white feathers,
except the head and neck that are naked; and their principal difference is in
the size of the body and the make of the bill; the lower chap of the jabiru
guacu being broad, and bending upwards.</P>
<P>A bird still more extraordinary may be added to this class,
called the Anhima, and, like the the two former, a native of Brasil. This is
a water-fowl of the rapacious kind, and bigger than a swan. The head, which
is small for the size of the body, bears a black bill, which is not above
two inches long; but what distin∣guishes it in particular is a horn growing
from the forehead as long as the bill, and bending forward like that of the
fabulous unicorn of the ancients. This horn is not much thicker than a
crow-quill, as round as if it were turned <PB N="390" REF="421"/> in a lathe,
and of an ivory colour. But this is not the only instrument of battle this
formidable bird carries; it seems to be armed at all points; for at the
fore-part of each wing, at the second joint, spring two straight
triangular spurs, about as thick as ones little finger: the foremost of
these goads or spurs is above an inch long; the hinder is shorter, and
both of a dusky colour. The claws also are long and sharp; the colour is
black and white; and they cry terribly loud, sounding something like Vyhoo
Vyhoo. They are never found alone, but always in pairs; the cock and hen prowl
together; and their fidelity is said to be such, that when one dies, the
other never departs from the carcase, but dies with its companion. It makes
its nest of clay, near the bodies of trees, upon the ground, of the shape
of an oven.</P>
<P>One bird more may be subjoined to this class, not for the
oddity of its figure, but the peculi∣arity of its manners. It is vulgarly
called by our sailors the Buffoon Bird, and by the French the Demoiselle,
or Lady. The same qualities have procured it these different appellations
from two nations who, on more occasions than this, look upon the same
objects in very differ∣ent lights. The peculiar gestures and contor∣tions of
this bird, the proper name of which is the Numidian Crane, are extremely
singular; <PB N="391" REF="422"/> and the French, who are skilled in the
arts of elegant gesticulation, consider all its motions as lady-like and
graceful. Our English sailors however, who have not entered so deeply
into the dancing art, think, that while thus in mo∣tion, the bird cuts but a
very ridiculous figure. It stoops, rises, lifts one wing, then another,
turns round, sails forward, then back again; all which highly diverts our
seamen; not imagining, perhaps, that all these contortions are but the
aukward expression not of the poor animal's pleasures but its fears.</P>
<P>It is a very scarce bird; the plumage is of a leaden grey; but
it is distinguished by fine white feathers, consisting of long fibres,
which fall from the back of the head, about four inches long; while the
fore-part of the neck is adorned with black feathers, composed of very fine,
soft, and long fibres, that hang down upon the stomach, and give the bird a
very graceful appearance. The ancients have described a buffoon bird, but
there are many reasons to believe that theirs is not the Numidian crane. It
comes from that country from whence it has taken its name.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V. Of the Heron and its Varieties.</HEAD>
<P>BIRDS of the crane, the stork, and the heron kind, bear a very
strong affinity to each other; and their differences are not easily
discernible. As for the crane and the stork, they differ rather in their
nature and internal conformation than in their external figure; but still,
they may be known asunder, as well by their colour as by the stork's claws,
which are very peculiar, and more resembling a man's nails than the claws of
a bird. The heron may be distinguished from both, as well by its size,
which is much less, as by its bill, which in proportion is much longer; but
particularly by the middle claw on each foot, which is toothed like a saw,
for the better seizing and holding its slippery prey. Should other marks
fail, however, there is an anatomical distinction, in which herons differ
from all other birds; which is, that they have but one coecum, and all other
birds have two.</P>
<P>Of this tribe, Brison has enumerated not less than
forty-seven sorts, all differing in their size, figure, and plumage; and
with talents adapted to their place of residence, or their peculiar 
<PB N="393" REF="424"/> pursuits. But, how various soever the heron kind may
be in their colours or their bills, they all seem possessed of the
same manners, and have but one character of cowardice and rapa∣city,
indolence, yet insatiable hunger. Other birds are found to grow fat by an
abundant supply of food; but these, though excessively destructive
and voracious, are ever found to have lean and carrion bodies, as if not even
plenty were sufficient for their support.</P>
<P>The common heron is remarkably light, in proportion to its bulk,
scarce weighing three pounds and an half, yet it expands a breadth of wing
which is five feet from tip to tip. Its bill is very long, being five inches
from the point to the base; its claws are long, sharp, and the middlemost
toothed like a saw. Yet, thus armed as it appears for war, it is indolent and
cowardly, and even flies at the approach of a sparrow-hawk. It was once the
amusement of the great to pursue this timorous creature with the falcon;
and heron-hawking was so favourite a diversion among our an∣cestors, that
laws were enacted for the preser∣vation of the species; and the person
who de∣stroyed their eggs was liable to a penalty of twenty shillings for
each offence.</P>
<P>At present, however, the defects of the ill-judged 
<PB N="394" REF="425"/> policy of our ancestors is felt by their posterity;
for, as the amusement of hawking has given place to the more useful method
of stocking fish-ponds, the heron is now become a most formidable enemy.
Of all other birds, this commits the greatest devastation in
fresh-waters; and there is scarce a fish, though never so large, that
he will not strike at and wound, though unable to carry it away. But the
smaller fry are his chief subsistence; these, pursued by their
larger fellows of the deep, are obliged to take refuge in shallow waters,
where they find the heron a still more formidable enemy. His method is to
wade as far as he can go into the water, and there patiently wait the approach
of his prey, which when it comes within sight, he darts upon it with
inevitable aim. In this man∣ner he is found to destroy more in a week than an
otter in three months. 
<Q REND="inline">"I have seen an heron," says Willoughby,
"that had been shot, that had seventeen carps in his belly at once, which
he will digest in six or seven hours, and then to fishing again. I have
seen a carp," continues he, "taken out of a he∣ron's belly, nine inches and
an half long. Several gentlemen who kept tame herons, to try what quantity one
of them would eat in a day, have put several smaller roach and 
<PB N="395" REF="426"/> dace in a tub; and they have found him eat fifty in a
day, one day with another. In this manner a single heron will destroy
fifteen thousand carp in a single half year."</Q></P>
<P>So great are the digestive powers of this fresh-water
tyrant, and so detrimental to those who stock ponds with fish. In
general, he is seen taking his gloomy stand by the lake side, as if
meditating mischief, motionless and gorged with plunder. His usual
attitude on this occasion is to sink his long neck between his shoulders,
and keep his head turned on one side, as if eyeing the pool more intently.
When the call of hunger returns, the toil of an hour or two is generally
sufficient to fill his capacious sto∣mach; and he retires long before night
to his retreat in the woods. Early in the morning, however, he is seen
assiduous at his usual occu∣pation.</P>
<P>But, though in seasons of fine weather the heron can always
find a plentiful supply; in cold or stormy seasons, his prey is no
longer within reach: the fish that before came into the shallow water now
keep in the deep, as they find it to be the warmest situation. Frogs and
lizards also seldom venture from their lurking places; and the heron is
obliged to support himself upon his long habits of patience, and even to
take up with the weeds that grow upon <PB N="396" REF="427"/> the water. At
those times he contracts a con∣sumptive disposition, which succeeding
plenty is not able to remove; so that the meagre glut∣ton spends his time
between want and riot, and feels alternately the extremes of famine and
ex∣cess. Hence, notwithstanding the care with which he takes his prey, and
the amazing quan∣tity he devours, the heron is always lean and emaciated; and
though his crop be usually found full, yet his flesh is scarce
sufficient to cover the bones.</P>
<P>The heron usually takes his prey by wading into the water, yet
it must not be supposed that he does not also take it upon the wing. In
fact, much of his fishing is performed in this man∣ner; but he never hovers
over deep waters, as there his prey is enabled to escape him by sinking to
the bottom. In shallow places he darts with more certainty; for though the
fish at sight of its enemy instantly descends, yet the heron, with his
long bill and legs, instantly pins it to the bottom, and thus seizes it
securely<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> In this manner, after
having been seen with its long neck for above a minute under water, he
rises upon the wing, with a trout or an eel strug∣gling in his bill to get
free. The greedy bird, however, flies to the shore, scarce gives it time to
expire, but swallows it whole, and then re∣turns to fishing as before.</P>
<P><PB N="397" REF="428"/>As this bird does incredible mischief to
ponds newly stocked, Willoughby has given a re∣ceipt for taking him. 
<Q REND="inline">"Having found his haunt, get three or four
small roach or dace, and having provided a strong hook with a wire to it,
this is drawn just within side the skin of the fish, beginning without
side the gills and running it to the tail, by which the fish will not be
killed, but continue for five or six days alive. Then having a strong line
made of silk and wire, about two yards and an half long, it is tied to a
stone at one end, the fish with the hook being suffered to swim about
at the other. This being properly disposed in shallow water, the heron
will seize upon the fish to its own destruction. From this method we may
learn, that the fish must be alive, otherwise the heron will not touch
them, and that this bird, as well as all those that feed upon fish, must
be its own ca∣terer; for they will not prey upon such as die naturally, or
are killed by others before them."</Q></P>
<P>Though this bird lives chiefly among pools and marshes, yet
its nest is built on the tops of the highest trees, and sometimes on
cliffs hanging over the sea. They are never in flocks when they fish,
committing their depredations in solitude and silence; but in making their 
<PB N="398" REF="429"/> nests they love each others society; and they are
seen, like rooks, building in company with flocks of their kind. Their
nests are made of sticks and lined with wool; and the female lays four
large eggs of a pale green colour. The observable indolence of their nature,
however, is not less seen in their nestling than in their habits of
depredation. Nothing is more certain, and I have seen it an hundred times,
than that they will not be at the trouble of building a nest when they can
get one made by the rook, or deserted by the owl, already provided for them.
This they usually enlarge and line within, driving off the original
possessors should they happen to renew their fruitless claims.</P>
<P>The French seem to have availed themselves of the indolence
of this bird in making its nest; and they actually provide a place with
materials fitted for their nestling, which they call He∣ronries. The heron,
which with us is totally unfit for the table, is more sought for in France,
where the flesh of the young ones is in particular estimation. To obtain
this, the natives raise up high sheds along some fishy stream; and
furnish∣ing them with materials for the herons to nestle with, these
birds build and breed there in great abundance. As soon as the young ones are
supposed to be fit, the owner of the heronry comes, as we do into a
pigeon-house, and carries <PB N="399" REF="430"/> off such as are proper for
eating; and these are sold for a very good price to the neighbouring
gentry. 
<Q REND="inline">"These are a delicacy which," as my author
says, "the French are very fond of, but which strangers have not yet been
taught to relish as they ought."</Q> Nevertheless it was formerly much
esteemed as a food in England, and made a favourite dish at great tables.
It was then said that the flesh of a heron was a dish for a king; at
present, nothing about the house will touch it but a cat.</P>
<P>With us, therefore, as the heron, both old and young, is thought
detestable eating, we seldom trouble these animals in their heights,
which are for the most part sufficiently inacces∣sible. Their nests
are often found in great numbers in the middle of large forests, and in
some groves nearer home, where the owners have a predilection for the bird,
and do not chuse to drive it from its accustomed habita∣tions. It is
certain that by their cries, their expansive wings, their bulk, and wavy
motion, they add no small solemnity to the forest, and give a pleasing
variety to a finished im∣provement.</P>
<P>When the young are excluded, as they are numerous, voracious,
and importunate, the old ones are for ever upon the wing to provide them with
abundance. The quantity of fish they <PB N="400" REF="431"/> take upon this
occasion is amazing, and their size is not less to be wondered at. I
remember a heron's nest that was built near a school-house; the boys,
with their usual appetite for mischief, climbed up, took down the young
ones, sewed up the vent, and laid them in the nest as before. The pain the
poor little animals felt from the operation encreased their cries; and this
but served to encrease the diligence of the old ones in enlarging their
supply. Thus they heaped the nest with various sorts of fish and the
best of their kind; and as their young screamed they flew off for more. The
boys gathered up the fish, which the young ones were incapable of eating,
till the old ones at last quitted their nest, and gave up their brood,
whose appetites they found it impossible to satisfy.</P>
<P>The heron is said to be a very long-lived bird; by Mr.
Keysler's account it may exceed sixty years; and by a recent instance of
one that was taken in Holland, by an hawk belong∣ing to the stadtholder, its
longevity is again confirmed, the bird having a silver plate fastened to
one leg, with an inscription, importing that it had been struck by the
elector of Cologne's hawks thirty-five years before.</P>
