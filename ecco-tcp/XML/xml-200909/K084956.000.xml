<HEAD>ADDRESS.</HEAD>
<P>AT a time when the Arts find universal patronage, and the enterprise of taste and spirit is drawn forth into works at once gratifying to the amateur, and honourable to the nation producing them, it is not easy for an active individual, in the habits of professional research, to content himself with merely admiring,—he feels a wish to emulate, and naturally adopts those means which best accord with his inclination or ability: The Proprietor of the present undertaking seeks to contribute his effort towards the further advancement of the <HI>Graphic Art,</HI> and on that ground respectfully solicits the attention of the Public to a field of emulation, which hitherto has remained unexplored; he aims to commemorate the actions of the re∣nowned Ancestors of our Nobility, and to trace them through those dignified scenes of glorious achievement, which at once gained for themselves and successors the particular distinction of their Sovereign, and secured to their country the dearest rights and privileges it enjoys; to those great characters are their countrymen indebted for the blessings of a valuable con∣stitution, and to their memories should be directed the highest tribute of reverence and admiration.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="6"/>The Publisher of this Work is fully persuaded, that in point of general importance, <HI>historical subjects</HI> founded on na∣tional fact, claim pre-eminence over all others; and he likewise knows that the most interesting events of a kingdom are chiefly to be looked for in the annals of its Nobility; he flatters him∣self, therefore, that his design at least will be approved, and is only anxious to acquit himself with satisfaction in the arduous task of collecting, arranging, and executing. In the choice of subjects for Engraving, every attention will be paid to those most important, interesting, and honourable; the services of the Soldier, the Seaman, the Ambassador, the Churchman, and the Senator, will form the source of Historic Composition—the Statesman and the Lawgiver, that of Portraiture,—and correct Views and Delineations of the venerable Castle, or Monument, which has been the scene or record of a remarkable event, will, with other apposite embellishments, further illustrate the Biographic Narration.</P>
<P>To the literary part of the Work equal attention will be paid;—nothing short of authenticity will be adopted, whe∣ther in the necessary supply of compiled materials, or in the original communications which the Publisher is already possessed of, and hopes to be honoured with from the No∣bility, or the curious in research; and the whole is intended
<PB N="v" REF="7"/>to be thrown into a form as elegant, copious, and comprehen∣sive as possible. In the arrangement of the Peerage an al∣phabetical mode will be adopted, but with due observance of precedency in the different orders of Nobility—thus will the Work in its progress take up a pleasing variety of ancient and modern subjects for the Historical Painter; and when com∣pleted, possess all the convenience of a Biographical Dictionary.</P>
<P>In every department of execution the Publisher's first aim is <HI>excellence,</HI> from a conviction that it would be absurd to ex∣pect public patronage without it; his Subscribers may rest assured, no Artist will be employed who is not fully equal to the task; and if a judgment, corrected by several years study and experience in the Art of Engraving, can further induce a repose of confidence, he presumes the Encouragers of the Work will not be disappointed: every thing tending to illus∣trate, embellish, or beautify the subject, will be strictly and uniformly attended to; and, in short, no exertion will be spared to form, through the medium of the Arts, a complete, elegant, and interesting PEERAGE of ENGLAND, SCOTLAND, and IRELAND.</P>
<P>{inverted ⁂} The Subjects intended for the Second Volume are now in the hands of the respective Artists.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>To please the amateurs of the Polite Arts, to gratify the lovers of Biographic History, to exhibit to the world the prowess of renowned ancestry, and lastly, to honour the brilliant achievements of our Nobility, is certainly a pursuit at once interesting, pleasing, and laudable.</P>
<P>It is near three years since this work was first offered to public attention, much of that time has been diligently appropriated to facilitate the undertaking, and every possible exertion made to fulfil the engagement—that with confidence, the Proprietor might look up to its Patrons for approbation and encouragement. Two years, how∣ever, had scarcely elapsed, before it became necessary to remove some injurious pre∣possessions entertained, of its being a work of adventure, and that it was not his inten∣tion to proceed with the execution of it. To confute this insinuation, he was fortunately and happily prepared; and to answer it with effect, lost no time in silencing that rumour, by immediately transmitting to the booksellers in London, and to those of the principal cities and towns in England, Scotland, and Ireland, Specimens of ten Historical Engravings, and as many elegant Designs, then executed as em∣bellishments to the work, together with other ocular and demonstrative proofs of the sincerity of his intentions. Had he been desirous of making the performance less correct and methodical, it would have appeared earlier, for much time has been spent in his personal attendance on those noble Peers whose titles and history com∣pose this First Number; flattering himself that in a work where the honour of their families is so materially concerned, they would readily have acquiesced in afford∣ing their aid. Some were found of this description, who with an amiable conde∣scension
<PB N="viii" REF="9"/>and goodness, frankly tendered their assistance; whilst others resisted his most ardent solicitations with coolness and indifference.</P>
<P>The connoisseur of real taste, the admirer of Historic Composition, where the su∣blime genius of the Graphic Art revels in her glory, by exhibiting the thought, the action, and the very soul of man, will find, in the progress of this work, a fund of information and entertainment, not eclipsed by any productions from the annals of the Grecian or Roman empires.—A treat also will be furnished for the amateurs of Heraldry, that typographic history of family alliances, the Proprietor reposing with confidence on their applause, and courting only a fair comparison with others to ensure their ap∣probation. To the lovers of Biography, he humbly presents a compilation from the most authentic of all the English peeragists, the late Mr. Collins; for the Scottish genealogy, he has selected from their most approved author, Mr. Douglas; and in procuring materials for the Irish Peerage, he has followed Mr. Lodge : the informa∣tion of these gentlemen is brought down to the present time, with improvements and amendments, revised by an officer in the College of Arms.</P>
<P>The new plan here adopted, of prefacing the history of the present Peers by a brief account of the ancient families who were honoured with those titles, but now extinct, is attended with utility and information, inasmuch as it aids the genealogists, and elucidates the annals of these kingdoms; for, in the process of time, it frequently occurred that the same titles were bestowed on different personages by different so∣vereigns; and, without a considerable attention to chronology, the reader is liable to confound one Peer with another.</P>
<P>Perhaps it may be expected some apology should be made for deviating from the usual mode of publishing Peerages, under the names of the respective kingdoms, separate from each other.—On a reference to those publications, it will be found that such of the Nobility who possess Peerages in two, or in each of the three kingdoms, are subject to much needless repetition, and no otherwise varied than in
<PB N="ix" REF="10"/>the titles.—By avoiding the old plan, therefore, and arranging them in the manner of a Biographical Dictionary, the reference to any respective Peer is accomplished with greater ease and facility, and the order of precedency still faithfully preserved, according to law, and the article in the Act of Union, as established in the reign of Queen Anne.</P>
<P>Many inaccuracies, no doubt, will insensibly creep into a work of this kind, from the unavoidable multiplicity of figures and dates; for such he solicits the correction and indulgence of the candid reader; but to obviate those alterations which come under the description of the increase or decrease of families and titles, it is the Proprietor's intention to give, at the conclusion of the work, an Addenda, stating such variations as will naturally occur during its progress.</P>
<P>To expatiate on the advantages of biography; to point out the utility and security of genealogy; to exhibit to the world the national benefits accruing from that stimu∣lus to great and noble actions, <HI>honorary distinction;</HI> to paint the ineffable esteem of a grateful people, for the services of their worthy Patriots; to hold up for general imi∣tation, the examples of great and good men, who have filled the various offices of church or state in the maintenance of order, for the security of public right, the pro∣tection of property, and the liberties of their country; would, in this place, be an∣ticipating what the work is designed to effect.</P>
<P>To avoid the imputation of prolixity, and to encourage the pertinence of brevity, is an object worthy the strict attention of the Editor, and no doubt requires a refined taste, and a matured judgment; without incurring the accusation of presumption, he trusts he may premise, that it is the first wish of his heart to execute it with accuracy, and to pursue his plan with firmness, reposing on the known taste and liberality of his country, in patronizing undertakings dedicated not only to amuse∣ment, instruction, and utility, but to aid a nobler purpose, that of holding up the strongest incitement to emulation, the example of others in the paths of every public and private virtue.</P>

ALBANY.</HEAD>
<P>ROBERT STUART, third son of King Robert II. was the first who enjoyed this title, being created Duke of Albany by his brother Robert III. anno 1399; and on his demise, his son Murdock succeeded him: but in 1425, his estate and ho∣nours being forfeited to the crown, it was conferred upon Alexander, second son to King James II. anno 1452; and after inherited by his son John, who acted as Governor of Scotland during the minority of King James V. who dying in France, in 1536, leaving no issue, the title lay dormant until Mary Queen of Scotland be∣stowed it on Henry Lord Darnley, who afterwards became her husband, and King of Scotland. In consequence, it was again vested in the crown, and continued in it till King Charles I. conferred it on his son Prince Charles, in 1601; and on his ascending the throne, he conferred it on his brother, the Duke of York, anno 1660, in whom it rested till he became King of Great Britain. This illustrious title was afterwards conferred by his Majesty George II. on Prince Edward, his pre∣sent Majesty's late brother, who died in 1767: the title thereby reverted again to the crown, and lastly bestowed by his Majesty on his second son, his Royal Highness Frederick, Duke of York in Great Britain, and Duke of Albany in Scotland, Prince Bishop of Osnaburg, and Earl of Ulster in Ireland, &amp;c. &amp;c..</P>

<HEAD>ST. ALBANS.</HEAD>
<P>THE title of St. Albans, according to Sir William Dugdale, was not used till the reign of James I. who first bestowed it upon FRANCIS BACON, son of the learned Sir Nicholas Bacon, who was Lord Chancellor of England, and was created Lord Verulem; and in 1619, was advanced to the dignity of Viscount St. Albans. He married Alice, one of the daughters and coheirs of Benedict Barnham, Alderman of London; but having no issue by her, the titles and honours at his death became extinct, in 1626.</P>
<P>RICHARD DE BURGH, Earl of Clanricarde in Ireland, next enjoyed the title, who, by letters patent, bearing date April 3, 1623, was advanced to the English honours of Baron of Somerhill, and Viscount Tunbridge; and upon the 23d of Au∣gust, 1628, had conferred on him the dignity of Earl of St. Albans. He married Frances, the sole daughter and heiress of Sir Francis Walsingham, Knt. by whom he had a son, Ulrick, his successor, and two daughters. He died in Novem∣ber, 1636.</P>
<P>ULICK, or ULRICK, his son and heir succeeded him; who, in the time of the rebellion in Ireland came over to England for refuge, was on the 21st of February, 1645, by Charles I. created Marquis of Clanricarde. He married Lady Anne, daughter to William Earl of Northampton, and having by her only one daughter, the title became extinct at his death, anno 1659, by the failure of male issue.</P>

<HEAD>BEAUCLERK, DUKE OF ST. ALBANS.</HEAD>
<P>CHARLES, a natural son of King Charles II. (by Mrs. Eleanor Gwin) was born in Lincoln's-inn-fields, on May 8, 1670, and by his Majesty surnamed Beauckerk; and by letters patent, dated at Westminster, on December 27, 1676, was advanced to the state and degree of Baron of Heddington, in com. Oxon. as also Earl of Bur∣ford, in the same county, and to the heirs male of his body, with remainder, for default of such issue, to James, likewise surnamed Beauclerk (another of the natu∣ral sons of the said King by the before mentioned Mrs. Eleanor Gwin) and the heirs male of his body; which James died in France about Michaelmas, in the year 1680, unmarried. The said Charles was also further advanced to the dignity of DUKE OF ST. ALBANS, by other letters patent, dated on January 10, 1684, and was constituted Register of the High Court of Chancery, as also Master Fal∣coner of England, with remainder to the heirs male of his body.</P>
<P>In the reign of James II. his Grace had a regiment of horse; which being under the command of his Lieutenant-colonel Langston, was among the first that went over to the Prince of Orange, on his landing in the west. His Grace at that time was a volunteer in the Emperor's army in Hungary, and at the siege of Belgrade, he gained great honour in the general assault, September 6, 1688.</P>
<P>His Grace, being of full age, was introduced into the House of Peers, on Sep∣tember 26, 1692; and the year after made the campaign under King William, arriving in the camp at Park, near Louvain, in June, 1693. Returning with his Majesty into England, he was sworn Captain of the Band of Pensioners, on No∣vember 30, 1693, in the place of Lord Lovelace, deceased, and served in the cam∣paign of 1695.</P>
<P>In 1697, the King of France acquainting his Majesty with the Duke of Bur∣gundy's marriage, he was pleased (at Kensington) on December 21, to appoint his Grace, then one of the Lords of the Bedchamber, to return the compliment of the French King and the Dauphin.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="15"/>Queen Anne continued his Grace Captain of the Band of Pensioners, and at the head of them he closed the procession, on September 7, 1704, on her Majesty's going to St. Paul's on the thanksgiving day for the glorious victory obtained at Blenheim, or Hockstet, on August 13, 1704. On the change of ministry in 1710, his Grace was removed from his office, and was succeeded therein by Henry Duke of Beaufort, January 10, 1711-12: but George I. on his accession to the throne, reinstated him in that post; and on November 12, 1714, constituted him Lord Lieutenant and Custos Rotulorum of Berkshire. On March 31, 1718, he was elected one of the Knights Companions of the most noble Order of the Garter, and installed at Windsor, on April 30 following.</P>
<P>His Grace departed this life on May 11, 1726, in the fifty-sixth year of his age; at which time, beside the offices before mentioned, he enjoyed those of High-Steward of Windsor and Oakingham, in Berkshire. His Grace had a stately and hand∣some seat at Windsor, which he greatly improved with beautiful gardens, extending to the park wall, and opening a view into the high street of the town. April 17, 1694, he married Lady Diana Vere, who was daughter, and at length, sole heir of Aubrey de Vere, the twentieth and last Earl of Oxford, of that family, whereof Alberick, their direct ancestor, is mentioned in Doomsday-book to be an Earl in the reign of Edward the Confessor. She was first Lady of the Bedchamber, and Lady of the Stole, to Queen Caroline, when Princess of Wales. His Grace by her (who survived him till January 15, 1741-2) left eight sons:

In the year 1725, he was chosen one of those persons, who, in consideration of their great merits, were chosen Knights Companions of the most honourable Order of the Bath. In 1726, he succeeded his father in his honours, and on February 22 following, was appointed Lord Lieutenant of the county of Berks, as he was on September 14, 1727, in the first year of George II.; and on October 11 following, assisting at his Majesty's coronation, had the honour of carrying the Queen's crown. In May, 1730, his Grace was made Governor of Windsor castle, and Warden of the forest of Windsor, and was one of the Lords of his Ma∣jesty's Bedchamber. On March 20, 1740, his Grace was elected a Knight of the most noble Order of the Garter, and installed, at Windsor, on April 21 following. On December 13, 1722, he married Lucy, daughter and coheir of Sir John Wer∣den, of Hollyport in Berkshire, Bart and by her had issue one son, George, and one daughter, Lady Diana: the first succeeded him in his honours and estate, as hereafter. His sister, on February 2, 1761, married the Honourable and Reverend Shute Barrington, Canon of Christ's Church, Oxford, and one of the King's Chap∣lains in Ordinary, late Bishop of Salisbury, and brother to William Wildman Barrington, Viscount Barrington in Ireland. His Grace departed this life on Sa∣turday, July 27, 1751, in the fifty-sixth year of his age, at his house in St. James's Place; his Dutchess surviving him till November 12, 1752.</P>

On Novem∣ber 15, 1728, he was constituted Vice-chamberlain of her Majesty's Household; and died at Bath, on February 23, 1732. In 1725, he married Charlotte, daughter and coheir of Sir John Werden, of Cholmeston in Cheshire, and Layland in Lan∣cashire, and Hollyport in Berkshire, Bart. and by her (who died on June 17, 1745) left two sons, William, who died at Eton school, and Charles Beauclerk, who in March, 1739, was appointed one of the Pages of Honour to the Duke of Cumberland; and after several gradations in the army, promoted, on October 16, 1761, to the command of the 107th regiment of foot. He married Miss Eliza Jones, by whom he had a son, George, born in 1758, who was afterwards fourth Duke. His Lordship had also two daughters, Charlotte and Caroline: Charlotte, the eldest, married John Drummond, Esq. son of Andrew Drummond, Esq.

In 1721, his Lordship was Captain of the Lyme man of war, and was for many years employed in cruizing in the Mediterranean, and the Streights, with Sir JohnJennings's squadron. His Lordship afterwards had the command of the Hampton Court, one of the ships in the squadron under Sir Charles Wager, that sailed from Spithead in July, 1731, to introduce the Spanish garrisons into Tuscany. Some time after he resigned his command, though he was then acting as one of the Commodores in his Majesty's navy. On March 7, 1738, he was constituted one of the Commissioners for executing the office of High Admiral of Great Briain and Ireland: he continued at the board, with some intermissions, till he voluntarily resigned, in July, 1749. After gradual promotions, his Lord∣ship was advanced to the rank of Admiral of the Blue squadron of his Majesty's fleet, in 1748; during which, his Lordship spent much of his time in Parliament, having, as a Commoner, represented the borough of New Windsor in Berkshire, and also the town of Plymouth in Devonshire: for which last place he was re∣chosen, in 1747; but before the conclusion of that assembly, his Majesty was gra∣ciously pleased to create him a Peer of Great Britain, by the style and title of Lord Vere, of Hanworth in com.

CAMPBEL, DUKE OF ARGYLE.</HEAD>
<P>THE antiquity of the noble House of Campbel, is acknowledged, in Scotland, by all their historians, and derived from a series of illustrious ancestors, who possessed Lochow, in Argyleshire, according to the traditional accounts of the bards and sa∣nachies, as early as the time of King Fergus II. who restored the monarchy of Scot∣land, A. D. 404. The first appellation they used, was O'Dwbin, assumed from Diarmed O'Dwbin, one of their ancestors, a brave and warlike man; and in the Irish language his descendants are called, to this time, Scol Diarmed. From this Diarmed O'Dwbin, the bards have recorded a long series of the Barons of Lochow, whose actions, they tell us, were renowned both for conduct and valour.</P>
<P>Paul O'Dwbin, Lord of Lochow, called Paul in Spuran, so denominated from his being the King's Treasurer, having no male issue, his estate went to his daughter, Eva, who married Gillespick O'Dwbin, a relation of her own; who changed the name first from O'Dwbin to Campbel, to preserve and perpetuate the memory of a noble and heroic atchievement, performed by him to the crown of France, in the reign of Malcolm Canmore. From this Gillespick is deduced the descent of the illustrious family of Argyle.</P>
<P N="1">1. GILLESPICK O'DWBIN, or CAMPBEL, Lord of Lochow, according to the MS. history of the family, lived in the reign of King David I. and married Eva, only daughter and heiress of Paul O'Dwbin, before noticed, by whom he had a son,</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="11" REF="25"/>2. DUNCAN CAMPBEL, of Lochow, who succeeded him, and flourished in the reign of King Malcolm IV. and left a son and successor,</P>
<P N="3">3. COLIN CAMPBEL, of Lochow, who lived in the reign of King William, sumamed the Lion: he left a son,</P>
<P N="4">4. GILLESPICK, or ARCHIBALD CAMPBEL, of Lochow, who succeeded him, and flourished in the reign of King William, and beginning of King Alex∣ander II. and is particularly mentioned in the statutes of that Prince, in the year 1214, &amp;c. He married Finetta, daughter of John Frazer, Lord of Tweddale, by whom he had a son and successor,</P>
<P N="5">5. DUNCAN CAMPBEL, of Lochow, who, in the reign of Alexander II. married a daughter of the family of Cummyn, by whom he had issue two sons, Sir Gillespick, and John, a very famous author, who flourished betwixt 1250 and 1286, and was an ornament to his country, for learning, &amp;c. Duncan was succeeded by his eldest son,</P>
<P N="6">6. SIR GILLESPICK, or ARCHIBALD CAMPBEL, Knight, of Lochow, who made a considerable figure, towards the end of the reign of Alexander II. and beginning of Alexander III. In the charter of erection of the burgh of Newburgh, this Gillespick Campbel, together with William, Earl of Mar, John de Lindsay, John de Hay, William Bisset, &amp;c. are witnesses at Strivling, 4th of March, 1266. He married a daughter of William de Somerville, Baron of Carnwarth, by whom he had issue one son,</P>
<P N="7">7. SIR COLIN MOOR CAMPBEL, Dominus de Lochow, who succeeded him, a renowned and warlike chieftain. He had the honour of Knighthood con∣ferred on him by King Alexander III. anno 1280; and from him the chief, or head, of the family of Argyle is called Macallen-More, in the Highlands, to this day. He was one of the great men, who were summoned to Berwick on the part of Robert de Bruce, in the competition with John de Baliol for the crown of Scotland, on the demise of Queen Margaret. This Sir Colin acquired from Sir William Lindsay the lands of Symington, in Airshire, and made a donation of the superiority thereof to the monks of Newbottle, by a charter, wherein he is called Dominus Colinus Campbel, Miles, fdius quondam Domini Gillespick Campbel, &amp;c. anno 1293. In a conflict with a great neighbour of his, the Lord of Lorn, he was slain, at a place called the String of Cowel. His death occasioned much bloodshed, and kindled
<PB N="12" REF="26"/>such a flame of animosity betwixt the two families of Lochow arid Lorn, as was not extinguished for many years after, even so long as the Argadii Lords of Lorn existed.</P>
<P>This Colin, by his wife, a lady of the family of the Sinclairs, had three sons: Sir Neil, his successor; Sir Donald Campbel, of Red-house; or Reid-castle, of whom the family of Loudon, and other cadets of this illustrious branch of the Campbels derive themselves; and also, John Campbel, who was educated to the church.</P>
<P N="8">8. SIR NEIL CAMPBEL, his eldest son, was honoured with Knighthood by King Alexander III. at the end of his reign; but none of his achievements are par∣ticularized till the year 1292; that on the demise of Queen Margaret, he was one of those eminent men, summoned to Berwick on the part of Robert de Bruce, when he and all the other competitors for the crown of Scotland had referred the decision of their respective claims to Edward I. of England: and when that Prince declared in favour of John de Baliol, Sir Neil Campbel did so far acquiesce in the decision, as to remain faithful to King John, till that unhappy Prince unkinged himself, by an inglorious surrender of the independency of the crown to the King of England, whom he acknowledged superior, and direct Lord of Scotland.</P>
<P>But no sooner did Robert de Bruce reassert his title to the crown, and formed a rational project of recovering his own right, and of freeing his country from its sub∣jection, than Sir Neil Campbel was among the first of the numerous patriots that resorted to him, owned his title, and gave so many proofs of his zeal and merit for the liberty and honour of his country, and of his loyalty to that heroic Prince, that he was thought most worthy, and appointed to command a party of loyalists sent to Argyleshire, to curb and overawe the Lord of Lorn, who was a declared enemy to the liberty of his country, and of consequence to the Brucian title. He performed that service committed to him, with honour and success; insomuch, that in a short time he recovered the countries of Argyle and Lorn, and brought them to submit to King Robert, though opposed by the joint efforts of the Lord Lorn, and his nume∣rous accomplices.</P>
<P>Sir Neil stood firm to King Robert; and was among those Scots patriots that accompanied him to Scoon, and assisted at the solemnity of his coronation, anno 1306; after which he gave many signal instances of his stedfastness and loyalty to that Monarch, even in the worst circumstances; for when he was far from being

<PB N="13" REF="28"/>firmly established on the throne, he entered into a memorable association with Sir Gilbert Hay, Sir Alexander Seton, and other loyalists, who met at the monastery of Cambuskenneth, and there laying their hands on the altar, and touching the conse∣crated sacrament, solemnly swore, "That till the last period of their lives they would defend the liberties of their country, and the right of Robert Bruce, their King, against all mortalsFrench, English, and Scots;" to which they appended their names and seals, the 9 th day of September, 1308.</P>
<P>After the King became well settled on his throne, Sir Neil, as an able statesman, was chosen one of the Plenipotentiaries for a treaty of peace with England, particu∣larly he, with Sir John Menteith, on the part of Scotland, and Richard de Burgh, Earl of Ulster, &amp;c. for England, in 1309.</P>
<P>Soon after the battle of Bannockburn, in 1314, he was one of the Commissioners on the part of Scotland, authorized to treat with the English for a lasting peace; but Edward refusing to recognize their master's title and independence, the treaty, at that time, took not its desired effect. The next year ensuing, he was one of the Barons at the Parliament, held at Aire, where they made an entail of the crown to King Robert, and his heirs. About which time, in consideration of his good ser∣vices, and signal loyalty, he obtained a grant of several lands, then in the crown by the forfeiture of those who adhered to the interest of Baliol: and to honour him the more, the King bestowed on him the Lady Mary Bruce, his sister, in mar∣riage, by whom he had two sons—Colin, his successor, and John Campbel, who was by King David Brace dignified with the title of Earl of Athol, then in the crown by the forfeiture of David de Strabogie; but dying without issue, the honours returned to the crown, and were afterwards bestowed upon William Douglas, Lord of Liddisdale. Sir Neil dying in the end of the year 1315, or the beginning of 1316, was succeeded by his eldest son,</P>
<P N="9">9. SIR COLIN CAMPBEL, of Lochow, who was also a great loyalist, and began early in life to distinguish himself for military atchievements. He was in the expedition made into Ireland, in 1316, in behalf of Edward Bruce, then King of that realm, where his behaviour, for courage and conduct, was so remarkable, that King Robert, upon his return, rewarded him with a grant of divers lands in Argyle∣shire, by a charter yet extant; and having faithfully demeaned himself during the whole course of King Robert's reign, he continued no less stedfast to King David,
<PB N="14" REF="29"/>his son, for whose service, even when his affairs were looked on to be lost, he raised four hundred men, and took the castle of Dunoon, then in the hands of the English; for which, and other eminent services, that Prince, when he came to be established on the throne, made him Hered<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ary , Governor thereof, which his descendants still enjoy to this time. He married a daughter of the family of Lenox, by whom he had three sons, and one daughter, viz. Sir Archibald, his successor; John Campbel, ancestor of the branch of Barbreck, of whom descended Campbel of Succouch; Sir Dougal Campbel, who lost his estate for adhering to Edward Baliol: Alicia, his daughter, was married to Alan Lauder, of Hatton. He had a natural son, Neil, of whom the Campbels of Melfort derive their descent. Sir Colin departed this life about the year 1340, and was succeeded by his eldest son,</P>
<P N="10">10. SIR ARCHIBALD CAMPBEL, Baron of Lochow, who firmly adhered to the interest of King David, during his captivity in England after the battle of Durham, and that Prince, on his return, rewarded him handsomely for his loyalty, by bestowing on him a grant of lands then in the crown by the forfeiture of Sir Dougal Campbel, his own brother, anno 1357. He married first, Mary, a daugh∣ter of the family of Menteith: his second wife, a daughter of Sir John Lawmont, by whom he left a son and successor,</P>
<P N="11">11. SIR COLIN CAMPBEL, Dominus de Lochow, as called in several au∣thentic writs; and being a man of great courage and resolution, was employed by King Robert II. in restraining the incursions of the Highlanders, who then greatly infested the western parts of the kingdom, and reducing them to his Majesty's obedi∣ence, obtained from the King a grant of sundry lands, as a recompence for this ser∣vice, which are yet in the family's possession. He also acquired from David II. a charter, ratifying the alienation made by Christian, a daughter and heir of Sir Dougal Campbel, of the lands of Craignish, to be holden of him and his heirs in as ample manner as Duncan Mack-dwyne, his ancestor, held the Barony of Lochow, which bears date March 25, 1370.

Sir Colin had also two natural sons, Dugal and Duncan, of whom the Campbels of Dunstaffnage, Enderline, Balvie, Duntroon, and others, are descended. He was succeeded by his eldest son,</P>
<P N="12">12. SIR DUNCAN, FIRST LORD CAMPBEL, first son of Colin. This Duncan being a person of great talents and abilities, arrived to high advancements, as well in honour as estate. He was the first of the family who was designed by the title of Argyle. He married, first, the Lady Margery Stuart, daughter of Robert, Duke of Albany, Governor of Scotland; and improved the opportunity of his near alliance with Murdoch, Duke of Albany, Governor while King James I. was detained pri∣soner in England, so far, that he prevailed with him to ransom and restore the King to his father's throne; and was one of the hostages sent into England for that pur∣pose, in 1424 : and it is observable, that his estate, and Lord Dalkeith's, were com∣puted at 1500 merks sterling per annum, and none of the other hostages exceeded 1200. He was highly esteemed by James, who constituted him one of his Privy∣council, and his Justiciar and Lieutenant within the shire of Argyle; and he was continued in the same offices by King James II. who advanced him to the dignity of a Lord of Parliament, by the title of Lord Campbel, in 1 4 45.</P>
<P>His works of piety are great and many: he gave in pure alms to the monks of the abbey of Sandale, in Kintyre, the lands of Blairnatiber; he also founded the collegiate church of Kilmun, &amp;c. &amp;c. This noble Lord left issue by his first wife, Lady Margery Stuart, three sons :

Lord Duncan died in 1453, and was buried in the church of Kilmun, over whom is erected a stately monument, with the statue of himself, as large as life. Archibald, son and apparent heir of Lord Duncan, died
<PB N="16" REF="31"/>before his father, having married Elizabeth, daughter of Sir John Somerville, by whom he had a son,</P>
<P>COLIN, FIRST EARL OF ARGYLE, who succeeded his grandfather, and was created Earl of Argyle by James II. in 1457. In the reign of James III. he was employed in the highest offices of state, being successively Privy-seal, Master of the Household, and Lord Chancellor.</P>
<P>In 1465, 5 Edw. IV. he and others had the King of England's protection and safe conduct, for one year, coming on an embassy, with two hundred persons in his retinue. His commission from James, King of Scotland, wherein he had the title of Master of his Household, bears date at Down, in Menteith, November 28, 1465, which impowers him to treat with the Ambassadors of the King of England, at Newcastle-upon-Tyne, on December following, on an alliance, as also concerning a truce, or cessation of arms.</P>
<P>In the year 1482, the realm of Scotland being invaded by the Duke of Gloucester, at the intercession of the Duke of Albany, who was banished the kingdom, he was one of the Lords, who, in order to prevent the desolation of the kingdom, signed a pardon to the said Duke, whereby he and his followers regained the possession of their estates: and to satisfy the King of England, respecting a promise of marriage between his daughter and their King's eldest son, it was agreed on, by an obligatory instrument made by the Provost and Burgesses of Edinburgh, that either the said marriage should be completed, or a sum of money be paid to him; at the executing of which he was one of the Lords present.</P>
<P>In the beginning of 1488, when the troubles in Scotland were like to run high, James IV. having entire confidence in him, was pleased to send him, with others, to Henry VII. of England, to desire his good offices and mediation: and soon after his return, he was again appointed Lord Chancellor of Scotland, which office he enjoyed as long as he lived. Having acted in the highest offices of state at home, and been concerned in the most important negotiations abroad; in short, having acquitted himself in every station of life with honour, fidelity, and reputation, he departed this life in the year 1492.</P>
<P>He married Isabel Stewart, eldest daughter and coheir of John, Lord of Lorn, whereupon he quartered with his own, the arms of this family (the Galley), and added Lord of Lorn to his other titles. By her he had issue two sons, and seven

He was ap∣pointed Ambassador by the Estates of Scotland, and sent to the Queen, then in France, anno 1558, to supplicate her Majesty in favour of the Reformation: but that not taking effect, and the French having got footing in Scotland, he, with the Duke of Chattleherault and the Earl of Arran, his son, applied to Queen Elizabeth for aid to expel them, by which he was instrumental in obliging them to quit the
<PB N="19" REF="34"/>kingdom; and having entered into an association with the Earls of Glencairn, Morton, and others, wherein they bound themselves to assist each other in ad∣vancing the cause they had undertook; which at last they got happily established by an act of Parliament, anno 1560.</P>
<P>Upon the breaking out of the civil war, in the reign of Queen Mary, he heartily and sincerely espoused her interest, and was General of her forces at the battle of Langside, against the Earl of Murray, then Regent; and though the Queen's troops were entirely routed, yet he still remained stedfast in his loyalty and fidelity to her Majesty: of which she was so well convinced, that after she was made prisoner in England, she nominated him, the Duke of Chattleherault, and the Earl of Huntley, her Lieutenants throughout the whole kingdom. He exerted himself greatly in every rational project that was proposed for the recovery of her Majesty's liberty; but when all their endeavours proved fruitless, he at last submitted to the authority of King James VI. and was soon after admitted one of the Lords of the Privy-council, anno 1571. On the death of the Regent, Matthew Earl of Lenox, he stood a candidate to succeed him; but the Earl of Mar being preferred to that important trust, he was, the year after, constituted Lord High Chancellor, which office he enjoyed with universal reputation to the time of his death, which happened in Sep∣tember, 1575.</P>
<P>He married, first, Lady Jean Stewart, natural daughter of King James V. whose remains lie interred with her father's, in the royal vault in the abbey-church of Holyrood-house; he married, secondly, Lady Jean Cunninghame, daughter of Alexander Earl of Glencairn; but by neither had he any issue, whereupon the estate and honour devolved upon his brother, Sir Colin Campbel of Buchan, his heir.</P>
<P>COLIN, SIXTH EARL OF ARGYLE, second son of the fourth Earl by the second marriage, was constituted one of the Lords of the Privy-council to King James VI. anno 1577, and Lord High Chancellor of Scotland, on the decease of John Earl of Athole, in 1579; which, together with several other great employments in the state, he enjoyed till his death, in the year 1584.</P>
<P>He married, first, to Janet Stewart, daughter of Henry Lord Methven, by whom he had no issue; he married, secondly, Lady Agnes Keith, daughter of William Earl Marishall, widow of James Earl of Murray, by whom he had two sons:

</LIST></P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="35"/>ARCHIBALD, SEVENTH EARL OF ARGYLE, was an active and brave officer, and was appointed to the command of the forces sent against the Earls of Huntley and Errol, at the battle of Glenlivet, anno 1594, where the King's troops were defeated, though the Earl behaved with great courage and conduct.</P>
<P>He suppressed an insurrection of the M'Gregors, in 1603, and a more formi∣dable one of the M'Donalds, in the Western Isles, anno 1614; for which signal services he obtained as a reward a grant from the King of the whole country of Kintyre, which was ratified in Parliament, anno 1617; and was made Heretable Commissary of the Isles.</P>
<P>In 1618 he went into Spain, and signalized himself in that service against the States of Holland, and assisted at the taking of several places of strength, till, by his Majesty's permission, he returned to England, and died in London, anno 1638. He married, first, Anne Douglas, daughter of William Earl of Morton, by whom he had a son, Archibald, and four daughters:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Lady Anne, married to George Marquis of Huntley;</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Lady Annabel, married to Robert Earl of Louthian;</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Lady Jean, married to John Viscount of Kenmure;</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. Lady Mary, married to Sir Robert Montgomery of Skelmorly:</ITEM>
</LIST>
they all had issue. The Earl married, secondly, Anne, daughter of Sir William Cornwallis of Brome (ancestor of the Marquis of Cornwallis), by Mary his wife, third daughter and one of the coheirs of John Nevil, Lord Latimer, by whom he had a son, James, and a daughter, Lady Mary, married to James Lord Rolls, and had issue. His son James, who was a man of great valour and courage, was by King James VI. created Lord Kintyre, anno 1622; and having served Lewis XIII. in his wars against the Spaniards, where he had the command of a regiment, he acquitted himself with such honour and reputation, that upon his return home, King Charles I. was pleased to raise him to the dignity of Earl of Irvine, in 1642; but he dying without heirs-male, the honours became extinct. The Earl was succeeded by his eldest son,</P>
<P>ARCHIBALD, EIGHTH EARL (afterwards Marquis) OF ARGYLE. He was appointed one of the Privy-council to King Charles I. into whose hands he resigned the Justiciary of all Scotland, anno 1628, which had been in his family for many ages, reserving to himself and his heirs the Justiciarship of Argyle, and the Western Isles, and wherever else he had lands in Scotland; all which was rati∣fied by an act of Parliament in 1633, when his Majesty was present in person.
<PB N="21" REF="36"/>And in respect to his own merit, as well as the remarkable fidelity and loyalty of his ancestors, his Majesty was graciously pleased to create him Marquis of Argyle, by letter patent, bearing date November 15, 1641.</P>
<P>During the troubles in King Charles's reign he joined the Parliament of Scot∣land, and was a zealous assertor of the Presbyterian-church government; but after the death of the King, he contributed much to the reception and coronation of King Charles II. and on the first of January, 1651, had the honour to put the crown on the King's head at Scoon: but having afterwards joined and sided with Oliver Cromwell, was, soon after the Restoration, found guilty by the Parliament of high-treason, and beheaded at Edinburgh, on the 27th of May, 1661, and his estates and honours forfeited to the crown. Previous to his execution he solemnly declared, "That from his birth to that moment he was free of any accession to the death of King Charles." Thus finished the career of a nobleman at the head of affairs in those distracted times, generally allowed to be a consummate statesman, and one of the ablest politicians of the age he lived in. He married Lady Margaret Dou∣glas, daughter of William Earl of Moreton, by whom he had two sons, and three daughters:

The title of Marquis of Argyle fail∣ing by the forfeiture of this Archibald, his Majesty was graciously pleased to restore Archibald Lord Lorn, his son, to the estate, title and precedency, formerly enjoyed by his ancestors, Earls of Argyle.</P>
<P>ARCHIBALD, NINTH EARL OF ARGYLE, was constituted Captain of the foot-guards in 1650, with this speciality—that though all the commissions were then given by the Parliament, yet he would not serve without a commission from the King. After the defeat of the royal army at Worcester, in 1651, he took arms for his Majesty's service, which incensed Oliver Cromwell so much against him, that though he granted a pardon and general indemnity to the people in Scotland, by his proclamation, April 6, 1654, yet was he, with several other loyalists, parti∣cularly excepted, and was made prisoner; and with singular constancy, preserv∣ing his duty and fidelity to his Majesty inviolate, would never submit, or come to
<PB N="22" REF="37"/>any composition with Oliver Cromwell, till he had General Middleton's order from the King to do so, bearing date December 31, 1655: he then, without any other engagement than laying down his arms, retired to his own house, and lived pri∣vately and quietly till King Charles was happily restored, in 1660. It was in con∣sideration of this his eminent loyalty and zeal in his Majesty's service, that his father's forfeiture was reversed, and he reinstated to the estates and titles, in 1663: not long after which he was named a Privy-counsellor, and one of the Commis∣sioners of the Treasury, which for many years he discharged with great fidelity, and through all changes earnestly espoused the Protestant interest, and Presbyterian-church government. About the year 1680 the Test act passed, whereby all ranks of people were enjoined, by act of Parliament, to defend the government in church and state, &amp;c. &amp;c. under the pains of treason, &amp;c. The principle of the act might be good and expedient, but carried a compulsatory air with it, which gave umbrage to a great many well-meaning men at the time, particularly to this noble Earl, who for strictness of honour and principle had so eminently distinguished himself; and when the oath was tendered to him, he refused to comply with it in those terms, but offered to take it with his own explanation, part whereof were in these words: "I take it, in so far as it is consistent in itself, and the Protestant religion; and I do declare, I mean not to bind up myself in my station, but in a lawful way to endeavour any thing I think for the advantage of the church or state, not repugnant to the Protestant religion, and my loyalty: and this I understand as a part of my oath." For which, and by the insinuating persuasions of some who bore him no good will, the King was so far incensed against him, that he was sent prisoner to the castle of Edinburgh; and on his trial, December 19, 1681, was found guilty of high-treason, his estate forfeited, and himself sentenced to suffer death: but he made his escape out of the Castle, in the dress of a lady's page, and got over to Holland, where he remained about four years. However, in the beginning of King James VII.'s reign, he got some officers and soldiers together in Holland, with whom he invaded Scotland, and landed in Argyleshire in 1685. He raised about two thousand men, mostly of his own clan. He then emitted a manifesto, declaring <Q>That he had not invaded his country for any private ends, but in defence of his own just right, and for the recovery of his estate, which was unjustly forfeited in the reign of the late King. And the Duke of York having invaded the religion and liberties of the kingdom,
<PB N="23" REF="38"/>he thought it not only just, but his duty to God and his country, to oppose his tyrannical usurpation, and invited all true Protestants to join him.</Q></P>
<P>The Earl's little army being defeated and dispersed, and himself taken prisoner, he was again sent to the castle of Edinburgh, and soon after there beheaded at the market-cross, in consequence of his former sentence, on the 30th of June, 1635, it being the opinion of the judges, that as he was already dead in the law, he could not be tried again for his last act of rebellion.</P>
<P>He left issue by his marriage with Lady Mary Stewart, daughter of James Earl of Murray, four sons, and two daughters:

<P>ARCHIBALD, TENTH EARL OF ARGYLE, eldest son of the last Earl, came over with the Prince of Orange from Holland, in 1688, and was owned by the Convention of Estates to be Earl of Argyle before his father's forfeiture was rescinded. He was a great promoter of the Revolution, and was sent to London by the nobility and gentry of Scotland, with Sir James Montgomery, and Sir John Dalrymple, to make an offer of the crown of Scotland, in name of the Convention of Estates, to the Prince and Princess of Orange, who on the 11th of April, 1689, were crowned King and Queen of Scotland; and on the 11th of May following the Earl, accom∣panied by the other Commissioners, tendered the oath of coronation to their Ma∣jesties, which they took accordingly. The same year he was admitted one of the Privy-council, and in 1690, was made one of the Lords of the Treasury. About this time he sent over to Flanders, for the King's service, a regiment, consisting of officers and soldiers of his own name and clan, who, upon many occasions, behaved with great bravery and courage. He was appointed Colonel of the Scotch horse-guards, and one of the extraordinary Lords of Session; and, at last, in consideration of his many eminent services, his Majesty was graciously pleased to create him DUKE OF ARGYLE, MARQUIS OF KINTYRE AND LORN, Earl of Campbel and Cowal, Viscount of Lochow and Glenisla, Lord Inverara, Mull,
<PB N="24" REF="39"/>Morvein and Tyrie, by letters patent to his heirs male whatsoever, bearing date at Kensington, the 23d of June, 1701.</P>

Archibald, first Duke of Argyle, died in 1703, and was succeeded by his eldest son,</P>
<P>JOHN, SECOND DUKE OF ARGYLE, whose genius leading him to a mili∣tary life, he went early into the British service, and was Commander of a regiment of foot when not full seventeen years of age, and gave great proof of his valour and bravery, eminently distinguishing himself throughout the whole course of the cam∣paigns of Queen Ann's wars, and in particular at the battle of Ramilies, at the attack of the counterscarp of Menin, of which he took possession. He commanded at reducing the fort of Piepondale, assisted at the siege of Ostend, and was service∣able at the battle of Oudenard; assisted again at the siege of Lisle, of which city he took possession; also, at the siege of Ghent and Bruges, in 1709. In the same year he particularly aggrandized himself at the siege of Tournay, and at the terrible attack of the wood, in the great battle of Malplaquet, upon which desperate command he was ordered by the Duke of Marlborough, where his person was much exposed, but came off unhurt, with great honour. At intermissions from his military ser∣vice, his Grace was not less active in affairs of state, having contributed much towards the union of the two kingdoms, and was very instrumental in bringing that great work to a conclusion: and when on that occasion a riotous multitude came in great numbers to the Parliament Close, demanding, with loud voices, "That the Treaty of Union be rejected," his Grace went out of the house, and spoke with such calmness and strength of reason, that they relinquished their claims, and retired peaceably to their homes. Her Majesty having restored the most ancient and noble Order of the Thistle, his Grace was one of the first that was received into that Order, on his return into England. Soon after the union of the two kingdoms, he was sworn one of the Privy-council: and to his other employments was added, that of Lord High Commissioner, to represent her royal person in Parliament, though
<PB N="25" REF="40"/>his Grace was then but twenty-three years of age. Her Majesty was so well satis∣fied with his conduct and services, that she created him a Peer, by the title of Baron of Chatham, and Earl of Greenwich, in England. On December 22, 1710, his Grace was installed a Knight of the most noble order of the Garter, by proxy; and in January following, was appointed Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to King Charles III. also Captain-General and Commander in Chief of all her Majesty's forces in Spain, and Governor of the island of Minorca. Our affairs in that kingdom were then at so low an ebb, that his Grace's friends were concerned at his accepting those employments, being sensible how difficult it would be for him to gain a footing; but he acquiesced in the Queen's pleasure, and some time after went on that service. His want of forces on his arrival there, would not permit him to undertake any considerable enterprize; but in September, 1711, he defeated a body of the Spanish horse, and took several prisoners. After which he was taken with so violent a fever, as obliged him to quit the camp, and retire to Barcelona, where, towards the latter end of November, being pretty well recovered, and the affairs of Europe taking a new turn by the death of the Emperor Joseph, &amp;c. he em∣barked for Leghorn, and left Florence in February, and arrived in England in March, 1712. Soon after his return, he was constituted General and Commander in Chief of all the land-forces in North Britain. His Grace, on the demise of the Queen, was appointed one of the Lords Justices, to be added to the seven great officers of the kingdom, for the government of the nation till his Majesty's arrival from Hanover. On the accession of George I. he was again constituted General and Commander in Chief of his Majesty's forces in Scotland; and the Privy-council being dissolved, and a new one appointed to meet on October 1, 1714, he was sworn thereof. Also on October 5, he was appointed Governor of Minorca; and in June, 1715, made Colonel of the royal regiment of horse-guards in England: and in the same year, he was made Gentleman of the Bedchamber and Groom of the Stole to his Royal Highness George, Prince of Wales. In September, 1715, a rebellion broke out in Scotland in favour of the Pretender, headed by the Earl of Mar, and others, who had the address to assemble together not less than six or seven thousand Highlanders, who marched from Perth about the 12th of November. The Duke of Argyle marched out from Stirling about the same time to oppose them, and by his interest and conduct prevented the rebels from gaining any place of strength. They
<PB N="26" REF="41"/>came to an engagement at Sheriffmuir, upon the 13th, where the Duke of Argyle's courage and conduct was remarkable; for though the rebels were far more numerous, and many of the clans fought very gallantly, yet they were forced to retreat to Perth, and his Grace returned with his forces to Stirling. After which, being joined by six thousand of the Dutch troops, under General Cadogan, he forced the rebels to abandon Perth, and the Pretender was obliged to retire to France with the utmost precipitation, without being crowned, as he had appointed; and for safety his ad∣herents were forced to fly the kingdom. Having settled affairs in the North of Scot∣land, he returned to Edinburgh, where he was joyfully received by the Magistrates and principal citizens, who on the occasion honoured him with an elegant and sumptuous entertainment.</P>
<P>His Grace came to court and waited on his Majesty on March 6th following; and in June, 1716, resigned all his places. In the year 1718 he was made Lord Steward of the Household; and on April 30 following, in consideration of his great services to the nation, was advanced to the dignity of a Dukedom in England, by the style and title of Duke of Greenwich. On his resigning the place of Lord Steward of his Majesty's Household, he was constituted Master-General of the Ordnance, and Field-Marshal of Great Britain, and, by George II. was appointed Colonel of his Majesty's regiment of horse, Governor and Captain of the town and isle of Ports∣mouth, and of South-Sea Castle, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>His Grace held many other high posts from time to time, and was equally con∣spicuous for his patriotism and his spirited eloquence in the House of Peers, as for his bravery and conduct in the field. He endeared himself to the citizens and inhabitants of Edinburgh for the noble defence he made of the privileges of the town, when it was moved they should be taken away on account of the premature death of an officer of the name of Porteus. With much truth he merited the celebrated character which Pope gives him—
<Q><L>"<HI>Argyle,</HI> the state's whole thunder born to wield,</L>
<L>"And shake alike the senate and the field."</L></Q></P>
<P>A magnificent monument is erected in Westminster-Abbey to the memory of this great Peer, executed in the best style of that eminent statuary, Roubiliac, upon which is the following inscription:
<PB N="27" REF="42"/>
<Q><L>Britons behold! if patriot worth be dear,</L>
<L>A shrine that claims the tributary tear.</L>
<L>Silent that tongue admiring senates heard;</L>
<L>Nerveless that arm, opposing legions fear'd;</L>
<L>Nor less, O Campbel, thine the power to please,</L>
<L>And give to grandeur all the grace of ease.</L>
<L>Long from thy life let kindred heroes trace</L>
<L>Arts which ennoble still the noblest race.</L>
<L>Others may owe their future fame to me—</L>
<L>I borrow immortality from thee.</L></Q></P>
<P>John Duke of Argyle and Greenwich, &amp;c. In memory of an honest man, a con∣stant friend, John, the Great Duke of Argyle and Greenwich, a General and Orator, exceeded by none in the age he lived.</P>
<P>Sir Henry Fermer, Baronet, by his last will left the sum of five hundred pounds towards erecting this monument, and recommended the above inscription.</P>
<P>DESCRIPTION.</P>
<P>The figures on the monument are principally larger than the life. The first is Argyle, in a sitting attitude, above the sarcophagus, leaning on the lap of Fame, who is inscribing on the pyramid the above inscription. Below, seated on the right, is an emblematic figure of Britannia, looking up to the hero with admiration and esteem: on the left, attired and ornamented with her proper attributes, is Eloquence, in the posture of persuasion.</P>
<P>On the tablet is a basso relievo, representing Liberty seated on her throne, with the Magna-Charta, &amp;c. &amp;c. at the foot of which is the Genius of Military Honour, presenting to her a shield, on which are the armorial bearings of the illustrious house of Argyle, &amp;c.</P>
<P>He married, first, Mary, daughter of John Brown, Esq. but she died without issue. He married, secondly, Mrs. Jean Warburton, one of the Maids of Honour both to Queen Anne and Queen Caroline, when Princess of Wales, and by her had five daughters:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Lady Caroline, married first to Francis Earl of Dalkeith, eldest son of Francis Duke of Buccleugh, and secondly, to Charles Townsend, Esq. second son of Lord Viscount Townsend;</ITEM>

<ITEM>4. Lady Betty, married to the Honourable James Stewart M'Kenzie, son of James Earl of Bute;</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. Lady Mary, married to Edward late Viscount Coke.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The Duke died in October, 1743, in the sixty-third year of his age; and having no sons, the titles of Duke of Greenwich and Baron of Chatham ceased with him; but in his other honours he was succeeded by his brother,</P>
<P>ARCHIBALD, THIRD DUKE OF ARGYLE, who was born at Ham-house in England, in June, 1682, and was educated at the university of Glasgow. He afterwards applied himself to the study of the law at Utrecht; but upon his father being created a Duke, he laid that aside, and betook himself to a military life, served under the great Duke of Marlborough, was Colonel of the thirty-sixth regi∣ment of foot, and Governor of Dumbarton-castle: but his genius pointing more strongly to the statesman than the soldier, he did not continue long in the army, but applied himself chiefly to that study, which made the latter part of his life so shining and conspicuous.</P>
<P>In 1705 he was made Treasurer of Scotland, and took his seat in the Parliament, where he made so great a figure, that in 1706 he was nominated one of the Com∣missioners for the treaty of Union, during the continuance of which he was created Earl and Viscount Islay, Lord Ormsay, Dunoon, Arrois, &amp;c.</P>
<P>In 1708 he was made an extraordinary Lord of Session, and in 1711 was elected one of the sixteen Peers for the British Parliament, and was chosen Member to every subsequent session, excepting that called to meet in November, 1713. In 1710 he was made Justice-General of Scotland; and in 1711 he was called to the Privy-council.</P>
<P>In 1714, upon the accession of King George I. he was nominated Lord-Register; and though he had long before given up all command in the army, yet upon the breaking out of the rebellion in 1715, he again betook himself to arms, in defence of the House of Hanover; and by his prudent conduct in the Highlands, prevented General Gordon, at the head of 3000 men, from penetrating into the country and raising levies. He afterwards joined his brother at Stirling, and was wounded at the battle of Dumblane. In 1734 he was appointed Keeper of the Great Seal, and was Chancellor of the University of Aberdeen, and was entrusted with the direction of the affairs in Scotland to the time of his death.</P>
<P>Upon the decease of his brother he became Duke of Argyle, hereditary Justice
<PB N="29" REF="44"/>General, Lieutenant, Sheriff and Commissary of Argyleshire and the Western Isles, Hereditary Great Master of the Household, Hereditary Keeper of Dunstaff∣nage, Carrick, and several other castles.</P>
<P>He was a man endowed with great natural powers, and distinguished for his men∣tal accomplishments; quick, penetrating, and thoroughly conversant in the know∣ledge of mankind; of an accurate and distinct elocution, and a ready judgment. His great knowledge in the laws of his country qualified him to shine in the great council of the nation, and in the cabinet of his Sovereign. His sagacity and un∣common abilities pointed him out as a proper person for the chief management of all the Scotch affairs; and the propriety of the choice will appear from his attention to the duties of his office: in time of peace, his study was to promote trade and manu∣factures, to encourage learning, the arts and sciences, and to forward every improve∣ment that would tend to the good of his country.</P>
<P>During his administration, the manufacture of linen cloth was raised to an un∣common height, both in quality and quantity. The Universities received distin∣guishing marks of his favour, by establishing new professions, and in every shape promoting their benefit; particularly, he encouraged the profession of Physic in the University of Edinburgh, which is now famous as a seminary for the study of that science all over Europe.</P>
<P>He procured from his Majesty George II. for the use of the infirmary of Edin∣burgh, the invalid money, amounting to about 8000l.; a sum that enabled the Ma∣nagers of that hospital to enlarge their plan considerably, the utility of which is daily felt by the numbers of poor patients, both naval, military, and others, who all find relief from this excellent charity.</P>
<P>After the battle of Culloden, he projected a plan in order to destroy the seeds of future rebellion; he advised his Majesty to employ the Highlanders in the army; a proposal worthy of the Patriot who contrived it, magnanimous in the King who approved it, and most honourable to themselves who executed it: for it must be allowed, that to this wise counsel it was principally owing that Cape Breton, Ca∣nada, &amp;c. are now under the government of this kingdom, as the courage and intre∣pidity of these brave men, wherever they were called, contributed greatly to the conquests of the British arms.</P>
<P>Such was Archibald in a public sphere; nor was he less distinguished in private
<PB N="30" REF="45"/>life. His eminent learning, and strong natural talents, contributed to make him pass his hours of recess from business agreeable to himself, and for the instruction and good of others. He was qualified for every subject of conversation, whether with the greatest philosopher or the most ingenious mechanic. For the amuse∣ment of the closet he collected the most valuable private library in Great Britain, where he unbent his mind from the cares of ministerial affairs, and kept adding to the immense stock of knowledge he had already acquired. The noble and magni∣ficent palace which he built at Inverara, will stand a lasting monument of his regard to the accommodation and convenience of his family, and transmit to posterity a just sense of the splendour and dignity of the house of Argyle.</P>
<P>He enjoyed all the faculties of his mind sound and entire till his death, which happened very suddenly on the 15th day of April, 1761, in the seventy-ninth year of his age; and was, according to his own desire, buried at Kilmun in the parish of Dunoon, in Argyleshire, the burial place of the family.</P>
<P>He married a daughter of Mr. Whitfield, Paymaster of the Marines; but by her, who died in 1723, had no issue. His estate and honours devolved upon his cousin and heir-male, General John Campbel, eldest son and heir of the Honourable John Campbel of Mammore, who married Elizabeth, daughter of John Lord Elphingston, by whom he had seven sons and six daughters: the first son and heir, with whom we now proceed, was</P>
<P>JOHN, FOURTH DUKE OF ARGYLE, of Mammore, who went early into the army, and in 1713 he commanded a detachment of the troops as a Colonel of the Queen's guards, that first took possession of the main guard of Dunkirk at the treaty of peace, in order to its being demolished. During the rebellion in 1715 he served as Aid de Camp to John Duke of Argyle; and in 1745 he had the honour to com∣mand his Majesty's troops and garrisons in the West of Scotland. He served in the rank of Brigadier-general at the battle of Dettingen, in the year 1741, where the British troops were victorious over the French, and served as Major-general in sun∣dry other campaigns in Flanders and Germany, during that war: and while a Commoner, was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant-general. He was Groom of the Stole to George II. while Prince of Wales, and continued to be so to his Majesty during the whole of his reign. He was for many years Colonel of the royal Scotch fuzileers, and after, Colonel of the royal Scotch grey dragoons. He was also
<PB N="31" REF="46"/>Lieutenant-general on the staff in England, and Governor of Limerick castle in Ireland.</P>
<P>His father and he represented the county of Dumbarton in every Parliament since the Union. In April, 1761, he was re-elected for that county; but succeeding immediately after to the estate and honours of Argyle, he was, on the 5th of May, 1761, elected one of the sixteen Peers for representing the Peerage of Scotland.</P>
<P>In 1720 he married the Honourable Mary Bellendon, daughter of John Lord Bellendon, by whom his Grace had four sons and one daughter:

<P>THE first with this title found upon record, was MALCOLM, son of King Donald VII. was created Earl of Athole by King David I.; and at his death was succeeded by his son, MALCOLM, second Earl; on whose demise, his son, HENRY, the third Earl, succeeded him; but he dying without issue male, the title returned to the crown; but Henry leaving three daughters, King Alexander II. con∣ferred the honours upon ALANUS DE LONDONIS, who became fourth Earl, having married the eldest daughter; but he dying without issue, the title was con∣ferred upon THOMAS OF GALLOWAY, fifth Earl, who was son of Uchtred, and brother of Alan, Lord of Galloway; he died in 1234, and left issue a son, PATRICK, sixth Earl, who unfortunately lost his life by his apartment taking fire in the town of Haddington, and having no issue, the title again returned to the crown; but soon after it was conferred upon SIR DAVID HASTINGS, who became seventh Earl, having married Ferelith, third daughter of Earl Henry; but he dying in a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, in 1269, left a sole heiress, Adda, married to JOHN DE STRABOLGIE, eighth Earl, descendant of Duncan, sixth Earl of Fife, who obtained from King William the Lion the lands of Strabolgie, which he gave to his third son, David, who from the possession of these lands assumed the surname of Strabolgie, which David was the father of the above John de Strabolgie, who having married the heiress, Adda, was thereupon the eighth Earl; he died about the year 1300, leaving issue a son and successor, DAVID DE STRABOLGIE, ninth Earl, who, by Isabella, daughter of Richard, natural son of John King of
<PB N="34" REF="49"/>England, had issue a son, who succeeded on the death of his father, whose name was JOHN DE STRABOLGIE, tenth Earl of Athole; he was one of those worthy patriots that joined King Robert Bruce, but was unfortunately taken prisoner after the battle of Methven, and from thence conducted to London, and suffered death, with two of King Robert's brothers, at Westminster, in 1308, leaving a son, DAVID DE STRABOLGIE, the eleventh Earl, who, having obtained large possessions in England, became strongly attached to that kingdom; at length he withdrew his allegiance from his lawful Sovereign, by reason of a treaty of peace concluded between England and Scotland, at Northampton, wherein it was stipu∣lated, that no Scotchman or Englishman could possess lands or titles in Scotland, unless he resided in that kingdom; this Earl refusing to return, was outlawed, and his estate and titles forfeited to the crown, in 1327, which he resented so highly, that he ever after became an implacable enemy to his country, and was killed at the battle of Kilblain, in 1335, commanding a body of English forces. By Johanna, a daughter of John Cummin, Lord of Badenoch, he left a son, DAVID DE STRABOLGIE, twelfth Earl of Athole, who still retained that title, though he lived in England; he sat in Parliament in the reign of Edward III. as Earl of Athole, and Baron of Mit∣ford; he married Elizabeth, daughter of Henry Lord Ferrers, of Groby, by whom he had two daughters, coheiresses to all his estates in England:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Elizabeth, mar∣ried to Sir Thomas Percy, Knight, son to Henry Lord Percy;</ITEM>
<ITEM>and, 2. Philippa, married to Sir Ralph Percy, a younger son of the same Sir Henry.</ITEM>
</LIST>
He died in 1375, was buried at Ashford in Kent, and was the last Earl of Athole of this family.</P>
<P>CAMPBEL, EARL OF ATHOLE. The title of Athole being now in the crown, King Robert Bruce conferred it on his nephew, Sir John Campbel of Moulin, the second son of Sir Neil Campbel of Lochow, by Lady Mary Bruce, his sister, who dying without issue, the title of Athole again merged in the crown.</P>
<P>DOUGLAS, EARL OF ATHOLE. King David II. renewed the title of Athole, by conferring it on William Douglas, Lord of Liddisdale, in 1341, in honour of the glorious actions performed by him in the service of his country. Having no issue male, by Margaret, daughter of Sir John Graham of Abercorn, whom he had married, he resigned his title of Athole in favour of Robert Earl of Strathern, afterwards King Robert II. whereby it was again vested in the crown.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="50"/>STEWART, EARL OF ATHOLE. King Robert II. was pleased to bestow on his second son, Lord Walter Stewart, the earldom of Athole, together with Stra∣thern and Caithness, in 1375. He married the daughter and heiress of Sir David Barclay, Lord of Brechin, by whom he had two sons:

<ITEM>2. Alan, Earl of Caithness, who was killed at the battle of Inverlochie, in 1428:</ITEM>

both without issue. Though this Walter had innumerable honours conferred on him, and marks of distinction shewn him, yet he was one of the chief conspirators in the assassination of his nephew, James I. for which he was most justly stripped of his honours and estates, condemned, and publicly executed. James II. conferred the honours upon his brother, Sir John Stewart of Belveny, &amp;c.</P>
<P>STEWART, EARL OF ATHOLE. The earldom of Athole having reverted to the crown, it was bestowed on Sir John Stewart of Belveny, the eldest son of Sir James Stewart (called the Black Knight of Lorn), by marriage with Queen Jane, widow of James I. of Scotland, and obtained the title of Earl of Athole in 1457; who was a person of distinguished talents, and both rendered his King and country many singular and eminent services. He married, first, Lady Margaret Douglas, daughter of Archibald Duke of Turenne and Earl of Douglas (called the Fair Maid of Galloway), by whom he had two daughters:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Lady Janet; and</ITEM>

<P>JOHN, FOURTH EARL OF ATHOLE, who was a man of great honour, loyalty, and integrity; and was made Chancellor of Scotland in 1577. He mar∣ried Lady Elizabeth Gordon, daughter of George Earl of Huntley, by whom he had two daughters. He married, secondly, Margaret, daughter of Malcolm Lord Fleming, by whom he had a son, John, his heir, and three daughters. He died suddenly at Stirling, not without suspicion of poison, in 1579, and was succeeded by his only son,</P>
<P>JOHN, FIFTH EARL OF ATHOLE, who secretly favoured the lords against the court and the Earl of Arran, in 1585; but was appointed one of the Privy-council to King James VI. in 1590. He married Lady Mary Ruthven, daughter of the Earl of Gowrie, by whom he had four daughters:

the other two daughters were married, but had no surviving male issue. This Earl died in 1594, leaving no male heir, the title and honours of Athole were conferred by his Majesty upon JOHN STEWART, LORD OF INNERMEATH, by patent, dated the 6th of March, 1596. This John, Earl of Athole and Lord Inner∣meath, married, first, Lady Margaret Lindsay, sister of David Earl of Crawford, by whom he had a son, James, his heir: he married, secondly, the relict of John, the last Earl of Athole, but by her had no issue; and dying in 1615, was suc∣ceeded by his son, JAMES, EARL OF ATHOLE, and Lord Innermeath, who married Lady Mary, second daughter of John, fifth Earl of Athole; and departing this life without issue, in 1625, the title, according to the last-mentioned patent, returned to the crown. But it being afterwards found, that the honours of Athole ought to have descended to the heirs female, on failure of heirs male, King Charles I. therefore conferred them upon John Murray, only son and heir of William, second Earl of Tullibardin, by Lady Dorothea Stewart, eldest daughter and heir of John, fifth Earl of Athole, consequently heir of line to John, the first Earl, uterine brother to King James II. whose estates and honours appear to have been granted to his heirs whatsoever, according to his charters from the King, dated the 25th of May, 1460.</P>

<HEAD>MURRAY, DUKE OF ATHOLE.</HEAD>
<P>ALL the Scottish antiquaries agree, that the surname of Murray is among the most ancient in their country, and that the family possessed large estates in Perthshire, and other parts of the north of Scotland, as early as the ninth and tenth centuries: but differ as to their origin; some deducing them from the Moravii, a warlike peo∣ple, said to have come from the continent, and performed signal exploits under Cor∣bredus Galgacus, or Galdus, against the Romans, and particularly at the battle fought at the Grampian Mountains, A. D. 84, and fully described by Tacitus; whilst others assert, that the progenitors of this illustrious family assumed their surname from the county of Murray, which they affirm was their inheritance. However, we shall pass over traditional accounts, and proceed to those confirmed by authentic documents.</P>
<P N="1">1. FRISKINUS DE MORAVIA made a great figure in Scotland in the reign of David I. (who succeeded to the Scottish crown in 1124, and died in 1153) and was proprietor of many lands in different parts of that kingdom. He had two sons, William, and Hugh, ancestor of the Earls of Sutherland. 2. WILLIAM DE MORAVIA, the eldest son, obtained from King William (surnamed the Lion) a charter, under the great seal, of the lands of Strabrock, Duffus, Rossile, Inchikel, Macher, Kintrai, &amp;c. which had belonged to his father. The charter has no date, as was customary in those days; but as Felix, Bishop of Murray, was witness to it, it must have been granted in or before the year 1171, in which that prelate died. This William divided his estate between two sons:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Hugh; and</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Sir William, from whom the extinct Lords Bothwell, the Morays of Abercairny, &amp;c. were descended.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. HUGH, the eldest son, got the lands of Duffus, where the chief seat of the family then was, and left a son,</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. WALTER, who was li∣ving in 1226, and was father of,</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. FRISKIN DE MORAVIA, who died after the year 1248, leaving only two daughters:</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. HELEN, married to Sir Reynold de Cheyne, who had with her the estate of Duffus; and Christian, wedded to William de Federith.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="53"/>Cotemporary with the last mentioned Friskin, was Sir Malcolm de Moravia, the undoubted ancestor of this noble house, and son of, 1. SIR JOHN DE MO∣RAVIA, who was High Sheriff of Perthshire, and probably a grandson of the first Friskin, and brother of Hugh: but at this distance of time the relation cannot be positively ascertained. The said Sir John was a very considerable person in the reigns of William the Lion, and Alexander II. and had a brother, Gilbert, who was consecrated Bishop of Caithness, A. D. 1222. He died about 1225, and left the aforesaid, 2. SIR MALCOLM, his successor, who was also High Sheriff of Perthshire, where, as appears by unquestionable documents still extant, he had large possessions, and left two sons, Sir John, and Sir William. Sir John, in 1280, made a donation of a tenement in Perth, to the abbey of Balmerino; to which donation William, his son and heir, was a witness, but his genealogy can be no further traced.</P>
<P N="3">3. SIR WILLIAM, the second son, got a charter from his brother of the lands of Aldy, &amp;c. and the lands of Lamabude (now Langbride) from his father. He married Adda, daughter of Malise, Seneschal of Strathern, by Muriel, his wife, daughter and heiress of Congal, the son of Duncan, the son of Malcolm, &amp;c. and by her obtained the lands of Tullibardin, which were confirmed to him by charter, from Henry, son of Malise, late Steward of Strathern, dated on the eve of All Saints, 1284. Sir William was one of the <HI>Magnates Scotiae</HI> summoned, A. D. 1292, to Berwick, by King Edward I. of England, and submitted, in consequence of that Monarch's determination, to John Baliol. By the said Adda, he left a son, and successor,</P>
<P N="4">4. SIR ANDREW MURRAY, who made a donation to the monks of Inchaffrie, for the health of his own soul, &amp;c. but having espoused the interest of Edward Ba∣liol against David Bruce, was beheaded at Perth, A. D. 1332. He left a son, 5. SIR WILLIAM MURRAY, who, upon the resignation of his grandmother Adda, obtained a new grant of the lands of Tullibardin, from Malise, Earl of Strathern, then superior thereof; to which grant William de Montefix was a witness, in the year 1335 , being then Justiciary of Scotland, northward of the Forth. Sir William's son and heir, 6. JOHN DE MORAVIA, got a grant, from Sir Alexander de Abernethy, of the lands of Pickerling in Fife: and left a son, 7. SIR WALTER MURRAY, who obtained a ratification and charter of confirmation, under the great
<PB N="39" REF="54"/>seal, of the lands of Tullibardin, Concusse, Pickerling, &amp;c. in 1362, besides charters of a great many other lands. Sir Walter made a considerable donation to the mo∣nastery of Culross; and dying in 1390, left issue, by Margaret le Baird, his wife, Sir David, his successor.</P>
<P>The said, 8. SIR DAVID, was first designed of Gask, and received the honour of knighthood from King James I. A. D. 1424. He founded and endowed the collegiate church of Tullibardin, which was dedicated to the honour of our blessed Saviour, and afterwards became a good provision for the remote branches of the foun∣der's family. He wedded Isabel, daughter of Sir John Steward, Lord of Innermeath and Lorn; and by her (whose arms are yet to be seen impaled with his own in the said collegiate church of Tullibardin) he had at his death, in 1446, five sons, and three daughters, viz.

He married Margaret, daughter of Sir John Colquhoun of Luss, Lord High Chamberlain of Scotland; and by her, it is said, he had seventeen sons, of whom many different families claim their pedigree. However, he was succeeded by a son of his own name, 10. SIR WILLIAM MURRAY, who received the honour of knighthood from King James III. to whom he faithfully adhered; and in consideration of his eminent services to that Prince, obtained, in 1482, the stewartry of Strathern and lordship of Balquhidder, by charter, which was ratified in Parliament, A.

He was made one of her Majesty's Privy-council, and Comptroller of the Household in 1565. Sir William was also one of those persons of note, who associated for the preservation of the young Prince, after∣wards James I. of England, and for presecuting the murderes of King Henry: and acted with great respect to the Queen. He, with the Master of Erskine, had the tuition of the young King; and when his Majesty took the management of affairs into his own hands, he appointed him one of his Privy-council, in consideration of his former services. Sir William died in 1583, having married Lady Agnes Graham, daughter to William, Earl of Montrose, and by her was father of three sons and two daughters, viz.

This John, Lord Innermeath, and Earl of Athole, at his death, A. D. 1615, left by Lady Margaret Lindsay, his wife, a son, James who married Lady Mary, second daughter of John Stewart, fifth Earl of Athole, before mentioned, but died without issue in the year 1625. Upon looking into the papers of the family, it was found that the honour of Athole descended to heirs whatever, as before mentioned; and ac∣cordingly this Earl John was served heir to John, first Earl of Athole, who was great-grandfather's grandfather, or <HI>tritavus,</HI> to his mother, Dorothea. The retour, dated Aug. 6, 1628, imports, that the King was bound in honour and conscience to ratify and confirm the aforesaid honour and dignity to the said John Murray, &amp;c. His Majesty, thereupon, by a new patent, under the great seal, "ratifies the aforesaid service and retour, and admits, receives, and confirms the said John Murray to the sole, undoubted, lawful, and just title of Earl of Athole, with all the dignities, &amp;c. thereunto belonging, in all time coming, to be enjoyed by the said John, and his heirs, with the same order of dignity, as it was possessed by the said John Earl of Athole, brother to King James II." This patent, with bears date February 16, 1629, also contains a clause of <HI>novo damus</HI> of the dignity of Earl of Athole to the said John, and his heirs, with a <HI>salvo,</HI> that it should not prejudice his and their right to the foresaid ancient peerage, &amp;c. &amp;c. This John Earl of Athole, who was a no∣bleman of great worth and probity, adhered firmly, at the breaking out of the civil war, to the interest of his Sovereign, for whose service he raised about 2000 of his men against the Earl of Argyle; and declared that he would oppose every measure that was contrary to the honour and dignity of the crown; but he died in the year 1642. His Lordship married Jean, daughter to Sir Duncan Campbel of Glenurchy, and by her was father of,

<P N="17">17. JOHN, MARQUIS AND EARL OF ATHOLE, with his father's
<PB N="44" REF="62"/>titles and estate inherited his loyal principles. He raised above two thousand of his followers; and in 1653, had several encounters with the English rebels in the northern parts of Scotland, when not above eighteen years of age. For his dutiful behaviour in behalf of his exiled Sovereign, he suffered great hardships during the usurpation: but in consideration thereof, King Charles II. nominated him one of his Privy-council, and appointed him Master of the Household, in 1661. He ob∣tained a charter under the great seal, constituting him heritable Seneschal or Steward of the county of Fife; was made Justice-General of Scotland, A. D. 1663; was appointed Captain of his Majesty's guards, in 1670; Lord Privy-seal, in 1672, and one of the extraordinary Lords of Session. Moreover, in regard of his eminent services to the crown, he was advanced to the dignity of Marquis of Athole, by patent, dated February 7, 1676, with limitation of that honour to the heirs male of his body. His Lordship was no less in favour with King James VII. than he had been with his brother, King Charles II. and was constituted Commander of the forces employed against the Earl of Argyle, in 1685, then in open rebellion. In 1687, he was created one of the Knights of the Thistle: and after the revolution he retired from all public business, living for the most part at some of his fine seats in Perthshire, till his death, on May 6, 1703. His Lordship wedded the Lady Emilia-Sophia, third daughter of that illustrious patriot and martyr, James Stanley, Earl of Derby; and by her had six sons, and one daughter. The sons were:

His only daughter, Lady Emilia, was married to Hugh, tenth Lord Fraser of Lovat, who had no male issue by her, and upon his death the estate and title devolved upon the famous Simon, late Lord Lovat.</P>
<P N="18">18. JOHN, SECOND MARQUIS, AND FIRST DUKE OF ATHOLE, embarked early in the revolution, contrary to his future sentiments, and the inclina∣tion of his friends, for 1200 men, whom he had raised, refused to fight against King James, and dispersed. In 1695, he was appointed Secretary of State for Scotland, and by letters patent, dated July 27, 1697, he was created Earl of Tullibardin, and
<PB N="45" REF="63"/>Viscount of Glenalmond. In the last of these years, he was constituted Com∣missioner to the Scottish Parliament; and was also Chancellor of the University of St. Andrew. Upon the accession of Queen Anne, A. D. 1702, he was nominated a Privy-counsellor; and on December 8, that year, was appointed Lord Privy-seal for Scotland. On June 30, 1703, he was created Duke of Athole, and Marquis of Tullibardin, &amp;c. with limitation of these honours to the heirs male of his own body; and, in failure thereof, to the heirs male of the body of his father, John, late Mar∣quis of Athole: and next year was elected a Knight of the most ancient order of the Thistle. In 1706, he opposed the Union, and not only argued and voted against every article of it, but entered several spirited protests against it, and was so averse to that measure, that he proposed bringing his own vassals to raise the Parliament by force, which was prevented by a difference and jealousy between the Duke of Hamilton and him. After that treaty was concluded, his Grace retired to Perth∣shire: but upon the change of the ministry, he was chosen one of the sixteen Peers of Scotland, to the two last Parliaments of Queen Anne; was called to the council-board, and re-admitted to his office of Lord Privy Seal, of which he had been divested for his strenuous opposition to the Union. When King George I. ascended the throne, he was a second time deprived of the privy seal. His Grace was twice mar∣ried, first, to Lady Catherine, eldest daughter of William and Anne, Duke and Dutchess of Hamilton, and by her had six sons, and one daughter; and secondly, to Mary, daughter of William Lord Ross, by whom he had three sons, and one daughter.

However, he returned to Scotland, in quality of Lieutenant-General, with a number of Spanish forces, in the year 1719; and made his escape a second time, after the defeat at Glenshiel. He was the principal of the seven attendants, who accompanied the young Chevalier into Scotland, in 1745; and taking possession of his paternal estate, raised the followers of his family, assuming to himself the title of Duke of Athole, by virtue of a patent he had received some years before from the old Chevalier.

Lord John Murray, who taking to a military life, arrived at the rank of Lieutenant-General, January 19, 1758, and also Colonel of the 42d regiment of foot, or royal regiment of High∣landers. He sat in Parliament for Perthshire from 1734 till 1761, when his nephew, the Duke of Athole was elected; and on September 14, 1758, was married to Miss Dalton, of Banners Cross, near Sheffield, with whom he had a great fortune. 2.

His Grace was elected Member for the county of Perth in the first and second Parliaments of King George I. In 1733, he was made Lord Privy-Seal for Scotland, and before the end of that year was elected one of the sixteen Peers of Scotland, in the room of John Earl of Sutherland, deceased. His Grace was also returned to the next, or eighth Parliament, of Great Britain, summoned to meet on June 13, 1734: but James Earl of Derby dying on February 1, 1735-6, without issue, his Grace claimed the barony of Strange and lordship of Man and the isles, as heir thereto by his grandmother, Emilia-Sophia, daughter of James Lord Strange and Earl of Derby, before mentioned; and these dignities, with some of the highest and noblest privileges of any British subject, being adjudged to him, he took his seat in the House of Peers, on March 14, 1736-7, as Lord Strange in England, with precedence, according to the writ of summons, to his great-grandfather, the above-mentioned Lord Strange, &amp;c.

BERTIE, DUKE OF ANCASTER.</HEAD>
<P>THIS family originally came into England from Bertiland in Prussia, when the Saxons invaded this nation; and by the gift of one of the Saxon Kings had a castle, and also a town, which was denominated from the Bertiestad, now Bersted, near Maidstone in Kent; Sted and Stad denoting, in the Saxon language, a town.</P>
<P>It appears from an old manuscript in the Cotton library, that LEOPALD DE BERTIE was Constable of Dover-castle, in the reign of King Ethelred; from whom descended HIERONYMUS DE BERTIE, founder, or at least a great benefactor to one of the monasteries in Kent, the north part of which he built at his own expence, and himself was buried in a chapel there, where these arms were put up against a pillar, viz. <HI>Three Battering Rams in Pale.</HI></P>
<P>The said Leopald quarrelling with the monks of St. Austin at Canterbury, about tythes, and the monks endeavouring to carry them off by force of arms, a fight began, wherein a son of Leopald's was slain; of which he complained to the King, but receiving no satisfaction, he flew for aid to Swain, King of the Danes, who invaded the kingdom with a powerful fleet, which was divided into two squadrons, one steering towards Northumberland, and the other for Kent, where they joined Leopald's forces, and laid siege to Canterbury, which they took in the year 1014, leading the Archbishop away captive. But Swain dying, the scale soon turned, for Ethelred miserably persecuted the Danes, and BURBACH BERTIE, the only surviving son of Leopald, conscious of his father's actions, went to Robert, King
<PB N="51" REF="69"/>of France, who received him honourably, and taking to wife a French woman, settled there, where his posterity continued till the year 1154, when Philip Bertie, with his family, accompanied Henry II. into England, and by that Prince's favour, recovered his patrimony in Bersted.</P>
<P>This PHILIP had issue MARTIN, who was father of ROBERT, who had issue WILLIAM, who had issue EDWARD, who father of JEROME BERTIE, who lived at Bersted aforesaid, in the reign of Henry V. which com∣menced March 20, 1412-13, and ended August 31, 1422.</P>
<P>This JEROME, one Sunday in Lent, hearing a monk in a church exclaiming against the murder occasioned by his ancestor, rushed in upon him, and slew him; for which rash act he was excommunicated by the Archbishop, from which he could not be absolved at any rate; so he went to Rome, where he obtained absolution, with this injunction, viz. "To hear, in the monastery of Canterbury, mass pub∣licly on a Sunday; then to ask, first of the Archbishop, and then of the monks, pardon; then to be absolved, and receive the sacrament, and to give to the convent two pieces of gold, as the fruit of his repentance, and for the souls of his ancestors. He afterwards became a benefactor, by new building, at his own charge, their church, by which (as my author saith) he much impaired his fortune on earth, but by it he obtained a greater in heaven.</P>
<P>To this Jerome succeeded ROBERT DE BERTIE, his son and heir, who had issue a son of his own name, ROBERT, father of WILLIAM BERTIE, who by his wife, a daughter of — Pepper, had issue, THOMAS BERTIE, of Bersted in Kent, Esq. who was Captain of Hurst-castle, in the Isle of Wight, the latter end of the reign of Henry VII. and was living in that of Edw. VI. as appears in a grant of his arms and crest, bearing date July 10, 1550, 4 Edw. VI. by Thomas Hawley, Clarenceux King of Arms; wherein he certifies, "That he was descended of an house undefamed, was then Captain of Hurst-castle for the King's Majesty, and had of a long time used himself in feats of arms and good works; so that he was worthy in all places of honour to be admitted, numbered and taken in the company of other nobles, &amp;c." By his wife, a daughter of — Say, of the county of Salop, he had issue Richard Bertie, Esq.</P>
<P>This RICHARD, FIRST LORD, had his education first in Corpus Christi col∣lege, Oxon, of which house he was Fellow, and afterwards under Thomas Wriothesley,
<PB N="52" REF="70"/>Earl of Southampton, Lord High Chancellor of England; and being singularly accomplished and learned in the French, Italian, and Latin tongues, he gained the affections of Catherine, the fourth wife of Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk, who left her a widow, August 21, 1545, 37 Hen, VIII. She was, in her own right, Baroness Willoughby of Eresby, being daughter and sole heir of William Wil∣loughby, the last Lord Willoughby of Eresby, of his surname, as is shewn in the pedigree of Lord Willoughby of Parham. But this lady being most zealous for the Reformation, in the reign of Edward VI. Stephen Gardiner, after that by Queen Mary he was restored to his bishoprick of Winchester, sent for this Richard Bertie, her husband, in the first year of her reign, and amongst some questions touching his religion, asked, "Whether the lady, his wife, was now as ready to set up mass as shed had been to pull it down, when in her progress she caused a dog in a rocket to be carried, and called by his name?" Whereupon being advertised by his friends, that the Bishop meant to call the Dutchess, his wife, to an account of her faith; and foreseeing the danger, he procured the Queen's licence to travel beyond sea, under colour of looking after such debts as were due from the Emperor to the late Duke of Suffolk, his lady's former husband. And having obtained it, passed the seas at Dover, in June, the same year, 1554, leaving her behind; who, in January follow∣ing went disguised from her house in Barbican, London, and passing to Leigh, in Essex, privately took shipping, and after much danger at sea, met her husband at Santon, in Cleveland, where after some stay, discerning that they were like to be questioned for their religion by the Bishop of Arras, they were necessitated to haste away on foot with her daughter, a child, and two of the servants, to Wesel, a Hanse town in the dutchy of Cleveland; but being got thither, extremely weather-beaten with rain, and going from inn to inn to obtain lodging, it was refused them, by reason he was suspected for a lance Knight, and she his woman: resolving, there∣fore, to get shelter in the church-porch, and to buy fuel to warm them there, in their way, hearing two young men speak Latin, inquired of them in that language, where they might go to some Walloon's house, and were happily brought where Mr. Perusel lodged, who had formerly received some courtesies in England from this Dutchess. By his means being kindly entertained, they changed apparel with the good man and his wife, and after hired a house in that town, having got a pro∣tection from the magistrates for their stay there; and here the Dutchess being brought
<PB N="53" REF="71"/>to bed of a son, October 12, 1555, he, by reason of his birth in that country, was christened Peregrine.</P>
<P>But when they thought themselves happily settled, intelligence was sent to Mr. Bertie, that it had been contrived in England to seize them there; whereby they were obliged on a sudden to haste to a town called Winheim, in the Palsgrave's dominions, where they staid till their necessaries began to fail; and then it provi∣dentially happened, that Sigismund II. King of Poland, hearing of their distress, invited them into his country.</P>
<P>They set forth from Winheim in April, 1557, 3 and 4 Philip and Mary, but in their way underwent divers great hardships, with no little danger of their lives by the Landgrave's soldiers; who, by reason of a quarrel for a spaniel, which they had along with them, thrust boar-spears into the waggon where the Dutchess, with her children, and the other women were; and upon pursuit of her husband into a village, had murdered him, but that he forsook his horse, and ran up a ladder set to a garret window, near the top of an house; by which means escaping their sud∣den fury, one of the Burgh-masters came to him, and brought another person who could speak Latin; to whom submitting himself, he presently dispatched letters to the Earl of Erbagh (dwelling within eight miles) who, thereupon repairing thither, shewed them such respect as properly belonged to persons of their quality. And seeing the Earl's behaviour to them, the authors of the fray got off, and made all the friends they could to them, not to report their usage in the worst manner. After which they passed on quietly towards Poland, where they received courteous enter∣tainment from the King, and were honourably placed in the earldom of Crozan, in Sanogela; in which place, having the absolute power of governing, they continued in great quietness and honour till the death of Queen Mary, and then returned into England.</P>
<P>In 6 Eliz. waiting on the Queen to Cambridge, when the Univeristy, for five days, entertained her with comedies, tragedies, and orations: Mr. Bertie had then the degree of Master of Arts conferred on him.</P>
<P>He died in the sixty-fourth year of his age, on April 9, 1582, as the inquisition taken after his decease, August 14, 24 Eliz. at Bourne in Lincolnshire, sets, forth; and was possessed of one-third of the monastery of Vawdie, alias Valdy, the manors of Edenham and Scottlethorp, and rectory of Fulston, the lordship and manor of

<P>On the death of his mother, he claimed the dignity and title of Lord Willoughby of Eresby, wearing his mourning apparel at her funeral in all points as a Baron; and was by Queen Elizabeth admitted to the dignity of Lord Willoughby, and to the place and integrity of honour thereto belonging (his father then living), on Friday, November 11, 1580, 22 Eliz. by the mouth of Sir William Cecil, Knt. Lord Burleigh, Lord High-Treasurer of England, Thomas Earl of Sussex, Lord High-Chamberlain, and Robert Earl of Leicester, who, by her Majesty's assign∣ment, had before heard and seen the petition and proofs exhibited and shewed by the said Peregrine, for the same dignity of Lord Willoughby of Eresby; and were, after report made unto her Majesty of his right and title to the same, commanded by her Majesty to declare unto him the said Peregrine, that, according to his right, her pleasure was, that he should be named and called Lord Willoughby, and be placed, reputed, and taken Lord Willoughby, of Eresby, which they did in the Star-cham∣ber the day and year aforesaid, even as they were ready to sit down to dinner there: and at the same time placed the said Peregrine Lord Willoughby at the table with them, according to his degree, above divers other Barons which dined with them at the table, and did all of them drink to him by the name of Lord Willoughby. And on Monday, January 16, following, he took his seat in Parliament, next unto the Lord Zouch of Harringworth.</P>
<P>In 1582 (25 Eliz.) he, with other Nobles, by the Queen's command, attended the Duke of Anjou to Antwerp, who had staid in England three months in hopes of gaining her in marriage; and, before the end of that year, was sent to Fre∣derick II. King of Denmark, with the ensigns of the Order of the Garter. In 29 Eliz. at the siege of Zutphen, in the Netherlands, on a sharp encounter with the forces of that garrison, he overthrew George Cressiak, at that time commander in chief of the horse, and took him prisoner. The year after, on the recess of the Earl of Leicester, he was made General of the English auxiliary forces in the United Provinces, and most valiantly defended Bergen-op-Zoom, besieged by the Prince
<PB N="57" REF="75"/>of Parma. In 32 Eliz. he was sent General of 4000 auxiliaries into France, in aid of the King of Navarre. And being Governor of Berwick, makes his will there, August 7, 1599, 41 Eliz. bequeathing his body to be buried in the parish church of Spilsby, in com. Linc. and dying in 1601, was there buried, as is evident from a monument erected to his memory. Sir Robert Naunton says of him, in his <HI>Frag∣menta Regalia,</HI> p. 39, "That he was one of the Queen's first swordsmen, and a great master of the art military."</P>
<P>The following transcript from his last testament is remarkable both for character and style:</P>
<Q><P>"In the name of the blessed divine trynitie, in persons, and of omnipotent unytie in godhead, who created, redeemed and sanctified me, whom I steadfastlye beleeve will glorifie this sinfull, corruptyble and fleshely bodye with eternal happi∣ness, by a joyeful resurrection at the general judgment, when by his incomprehen∣sible justice and mercye having satisfied for my sinfull soule, and stored it uppe in his heavenly treasure, his almightie voyce shall call all fleshe to be joyned together with the soule to everlasting comfort or discomforte. In that holy name I Peregrine Bertye, Knighte, Lord Willoughbie of Willoughbie, Beeke, and Eresbie, in per∣fect healthe and remembrance, and considering the frayltie of man, and the incer∣tentye howe shorte and evill his dayes by, and intending to establishe and dispose theis worldely benefytts that God hath lent me, to the comforte and advantage of such children as God hath blessed me withall, hoping that they my said children will nourish and mayntaine all brotherly kindness, love and affectyon betweene themselves, considering the misery division bringeth in all estates of this hatefull worlde, styll to the wurse declyning. Now I the said Lord Willoughbie make and declare this my laste wyll and testament, as followeth:</P>
<P>"He orders his body to be buried in the church of Spilsby, in the county of Lincoln, observing christian conveniency, and avoiding superfluous charge. He bequeaths to his son, Peregrine Bertie, his manor of Wheatacre borough, in the counties of Norfolk and Suffolk, with the appurtenances to him and the heirs male of his body, as also all his messuages, lands, &amp;c. with appurtenances, known by the name of Willoughby Rents, situate in Barbican and Golding-lane, in London, to enjoy the same after the death of his sister, Susan, Countess of Kent.</P>
<P>"He bequeaths to his son, Henry Bertie, the manor of Fulstowe, Beeke, and
<PB N="58" REF="76"/>Arseik, in the county of Lincoln, for two years after his decease, and the manor of Wythegall for life, and after to his heirs male, and the manor of Hanby, in com. Linc. for sixty years, and Willoughby parsonage for life.</P>
<P>"To Vere Bertie, his son, diverse lands and tenements in several manors for his life.</P>
<P>"To Roger, his son, so much of his demesnes of his manor of Gosberton, as are in the occupation of Henry Valentine, and diverse other lands, &amp;c. for life.</P>
<P>"And whereas a marriage was concluded between his only daughter, Catherine, and Charles Sheffield, Esq. son and heir of the Lord Sheffield, who was to have with her a portion of 4000l. he bequeaths the said 4000l. to be divided between his said four younger sons, if so be she died before the marriage was consummated; (which said marriage took no effect, the said Charles Sheffield, Esq. dying).</P>
<P>"He bequeaths to Edward Lord Zouch, Robert Lord Rich, Sir Drew Drury, and Sir John Peyton of Baupre-hall, Knts. his manors of Grimsthorp, with the park, &amp;c. Toynton, and the park, Stickford, Allford, with the royalties thereof, lately bought of Mr. Hanby. The manor of Well, the manor of Eresby, with the east park and west park, the manor of Spilsby, and Skidbroke, with Saltfleet haven, Friskney, certain lands in Earebie, Hundleby, and Rathebie; the lastage of Sher∣becks, two parks of the demesne lands of Valdye, als. Vaudye, with the woods, warren of conies, and certain lands inclosed; the new park of Grimsthorp, with diverse other lands adjacent. The third part of his great mansion-house, called Willoughby-house, in Barbican; and all his other lands, &amp;c. not before devised. To hold during the minority of his son and heir, Robert Bertie, and on his decease without issue, during the minority of his other sons.</P>
<P>"Moreover, he in most humble and dutiful manner desired her most gracious Majesty, that in some respect of his loyal and ready heart always to do her all faithful service, it would please her Majesty to grant the education and wardship of his son and heir, and one lease of her Majesty's third part of his lands during his nonage, to the said Lord Zouch, &amp;c. whereby her Majesty would most royally respect his long and affectionate service towards her. And for a small remembrance of his loyalty and duty which he had always observed toward her Majesty, he de∣sires she would accept of a cup of gold to the value of 100l. or some jewels of that value, as may best content her, and best represent the loyalty of his heart. He
<PB N="59" REF="77"/>ordains his son, Robert Bertie, sole executor, and the Lord Zouch, &amp;c. supervisors to his said son, and to administer in his behalf, till such age as by law he can take upon him to be executor. And ordains Sir Robert Cecil the only overseer, to whom he gives two of his best horses, at his election." Dated at Berwick, 7th Aug. 1590.</P>
<P>In a paper schedule annexed to his will, made at the same time, "he gives to his son, Peregrine, seventeen pieces of hangings brought out of the Low Countries, then at Berwick, as also a carnation cloth of silver bed, chairs, &amp;c. belonging to it; a yellow velvet be, a watchitt field-bed, embroidered with hair-coloured velvet: and orders the rest of his hangings, &amp;c. at Berwick, brought from London and Eresby, should be sent to the same places for the use of his eldest son, together with his plate and silver vessels.</P>
<P>"He also leaves to his son, Robert, for a token, the chain of gold with the Palsgrave's figure to it, set with diamonds, which was given to him by the said Palsgrave.</P>
<P>"To his son, Peregrine, all his books at Berwick and Eresby, and half of his library at London; but his whole library at Grimsthorp, the other half of that at London, and all his goods not bequeathed, to his son Robert; and was bountiful to every of his servants."</P>
<P>He concludes: "Thus acknowledging myself most bound unto God, that neither made me abound with worldly trashe, nor yet suppressed me with poverty; expecting richer joys that never faile in his hiest kingdom, whereunto, through his mercy, I have by the scale of faythe set forwarde on foote, and aparantly discerned the difference betweene heaven and earthe, and so apprehended stedfastly the joyes of the one by that I have temporally here observed. For I am sure my Redeemer lyveth, and he shall stand the last upon the earthe, and thoughe after wormes destroy this body, yet shall I see God in my fleshe, whome I myself shall see, and myne eyes shall behoulde, and no other for me, though my reynes are consumed within me. So to his mercy I commend you all, beloved race, and frendes."</P></Q>
<P>He married Mary, daughter to John Vere, Earl of Oxford, sister and heir of the whole blood to Edward, seventeenth Earl of Oxford, and left issue by her five sons, and a daughter, Catherine, married to Sir Lewis Watson, of Rockingham-castle, in the county of Northampton, afterwards Lord Rockingham. The eldest son was Robert,
<PB N="60" REF="78"/>who succeeded his father. Peregrine, the second son, at the creation of Henry Prince of Wales, June 2, 1610, was, by a bill signed with the King's own hand, appointed to repair to Durham-house, and was made one of the Knights of the Bath. He died, aged 65, in 1640, and by Margaret, his wife, daughter of Nicholas Saun∣derson, Viscount Castleton, left issue Nicholas Bertie, of St. Martin's in the Fields, Westminster, Esq. who died ..... January, 1671; and by his wife, Mary, daughter of Edward Raybone, of Chard, in com. Somers. had issue Peregrine Bertie, Esq. born January 14, 1655. 3. Henry, 4. Vere, and, 5. Roger, were the other sons.</P>
<P>The said ROBERT, FIRST EARL OF LINDSEY, the eldest son, in the 1st of James I. making his claim to the earldom of Oxford, as also to the title of Lord Bulbeck, Sandford, and Badlesmere, and to the office of Lord High-Cham∣berlain of England, as son and heir to Mary, the sole daughter of that great family (as before noted), after much dispute, had judgment on his behalf for the office of Lord High-Chamberlain; and the same year took his seat above all the Barons. On January 5, 1604-5, 2 Jac. I. he was, with Charles Duke of Albany (after Charles I.) and ten others, made Knights of the Bath. On November 22, 1626, the 2d of Charles I. he was advanced to the dignity of Earl of Lindsey. The pre∣amble to his patent recites, That the King, in consideration of the merits of Robert Lord Willoughby, of Willoughby, Beake, and Eresby, Lord Great-Chamberlain of England; and that he is a man, the brave son of a most noble and gallant father, and of great loyalty to us: and also how much he merited by his services to us, when in Denmark and Norway, and commander of the forces in the United Provinces; where he behaved as a valiant Knight fit for command, and crowned his high birth with virtue, wisdom, and sweetness of behaviour. Also remembering his hereditary right to the office of Lord High-Chamberlain of England, devolved upon him from Robert de Vere, his next cousin and heir; and as that place, in the earliest times, was enjoyed by no person, under the degree of an Earl, he creates him Earl of Lindsey. And four years after he was elected a Knight of the most noble Order of the Garter. On November 28, next year, 1631, the 7th of Charles I. was made Constable of England, for the trial of Lord Rea, and David Ramsey, in the court military; but his patent was revoked 20 May after.</P>
<P>IN the 11th of Charles I. he was constituted Lord High-Admiral of England; and in 1639, on the Scots taking arms, he was made Governor of Berwick. Also

<PB N="61" REF="80"/>in June, 1642, being chosen General of the King's forces at the breaking out of the civil war, he, on October 23 following, received his death's wound in his Majesty's service, at the battle of Edge-hill, in the county of Warwick, and was brought pri∣soner to Warwick-castle, where he died the same night, aged 60 years, and was buried at Edenham, in com. Linc. The Earl of Clarendon gives him this charac∣ter: "He was," says he, "a man of great honour, and spent the youth and vigour of his age in military actions, and commands abroad; and albeit he indulged to himself great liberties of life, yet he still preserved a very good reputation with all men, and a very great interest in his country, as appears by the supplies he and his son brought to the King's army; the companies of his own regiment of foot be∣ing commanded by the principal knights and gentlemen of Lincolnshire, who engaged themselves in the service principally out of their personal affection to him. He was of a very generous nature, and punctual in what he undertook, and in ex∣acting what was due to him; which made him bear that restriction so heavily, which was put upon him by the commission granted to Prince Rupert, and by the King's preferring the Prince's opinion, in all matters relating to the war, before his. Nor did he conceal his resentment; for, the day before the battle, he said to some friends with whom he had used freedom, that he did not look upon himself as Ge∣neral; and, therefore, he was resolved, when the day of battle should come, that he would be at the head of his regiment as a private Colonel, where he would die. He was carried out of the field to the next village (and if there could have been a surgeon procured, it was thought his wound would not have proved mortal); and as soon as the other army was composed, by the coming on of the night, the Earl of Essex, about midnight, sent Sir William Balfour, and some other officers, to see him, and meant himself to visit him. They found him upon a little straw, in a poor house, where they had laid him in his blood, which had run from him in great abundance. He said, he was sorry to see so many gentlemen (some whereof were his old friends) engaged in so foul a rebellion; wishing them to tell the Earl of Essex, that he ought to throw himself at the King's feet to beg his pardon; which, if he did not speedily do, his memory would be odious to the nation: and continued this kind of discourse with such vehemence, that the officers, by degrees, withdrew themselves, and prevented the visit the Earl of Essex intended him, who only sent him the best surgeons; but in the very opening of his wounds he died before
<PB N="62" REF="81"/>morning, by the loss of blood. He had very many friends, and few enemies, and died generally lamented."</P>
<P>He married Elizabeth, only child of Edward, the first Lord Montagu, of Bough∣ton, in com. Northampton, by Elizabeth, his first wife, daughter and heir to Sir John Jefferies of Shettingley, in Sussex, Lord Chief-Baron of the Exchequer, by Elizabeth, his wife, daughter and heir of John Ansley, Esq. and by her, who die November 30, 1654, had eight sons, and five daughters:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Montagu, his successor.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Roger, Knight of the Bath at the coronation of Charles I. married Ursula, daugh∣ter and heir of Sir Edward Lawley of Wenlock, in the county of Salop, Knight, and dying October 15, 1654, left a son, Robert, who died in August, 1698, without issue.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Robert, born on January 1, 1619, was Fellow of Sidney college, Cam∣bridge, whence he was ejected by the Earl of Manchester, on April, 1644, for his loyalty to King Charles I.; but after the restoration of Charles II. was Secretary to the Commissioners of the Customs, and died in 1708, having had three wives:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1st, Alice, daughter of Richard Barnard, Esq.;</ITEM>
<ITEM>2d, Elizabeth, second daughter of Sir Thomas Bennet of Baberham, in Cambridgeshire; and,</ITEM>
<ITEM>3d, Mary, daughter of Robert Halsey, of Great Gaddesden, in Hertfordshire, Esq.</ITEM>
</LIST>
and relict of John Crosby, Esq. By an inscription in the church of St. Giles in the Fields, London, it appears, that this Robert was an inhabitant of that parish, and that he gave 50l. to the churchwardens, enjoining the interest thereof to be distributed for ever in bread to the poor of the same parish, 12d. worth on every Sunday in the year; and on every Newyear's-day 5s. if on a Sunday, otherwise 4s. and on the last day of August. This benefaction took place in January, 1677.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. Sir Peregrine was of Eveden, in com. Linc. in right of his wife, Anne, daughter and coheir of Daniel Hardeby, or Hardby, of the same place, Esq. and left issue an only daughter and heir, Elizabeth, married to William Lord Widrington. The said Peregrine, and his wife, lie buried in the church of Eveden, where they have a monument erected to their memory, but without specifying when they died. According to Anthony à Wood, in his Athenae Oxon. Sir Peregrine had a daughter married to Robert Levinz, Doctor of the civil law, who was a Captain in the service of Charles I. and Charles II. and was hanged at London, on July 18, 1650, for having blank com∣missions in his custody from the latter; but does not mention her having another husband: however, if Sir Peregrine had no other daughter than Elizabeth, it is
<PB N="63" REF="82"/>evident, from the computation of time, that her second marriage was with Wid∣rington.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. Francis was a Captain of horse, and killed in the King's service in Ireland, in 1641.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. Henry was a Captain of horse, and lost his life in the King's service, at the battle of Newberry.</ITEM>
<ITEM>7. Vere died unmarried, at Newport, in com. Essex. And,</ITEM>

The five daughters were:

</LIST></P>
<P>Sir MONTAGU, SECOND EARL OF LINDSEY, the eldest son, in 1639 was Captain of the King's guards, in that army raised to march against the Scots, and waited on his Majesty in that expedition; and was in the battle of Edge-hill, October 23, 1642, where he commanded the King's royal regiment of guards; and being near his valiant father, and seeing him wounded and taken prisoner, was moved with such filial piety, that he voluntarily yielded himself to a Commander of horse on the rebels side, to be near and attend him.</P>
<P>Being afterwards exchanged, he resolutely adhered to the King's service, and courageously commanded the regiment of guards, in several battles; as thrice at Newberry, Cropredy, Lestwithiel, besides other places; also in that fatal battle of Naseby, where he was wounded; and had a share in all the misfortunes of that King, being one of the Gentlemen of his Royal Bed-chamber, and of his Privy-council, attending him even to the time his Majesty put himself into the hands of the Scots. At the treaty in the Isle of Wight, the King sent for him to be one of his Commissioners and advisers.</P>
<P>When his Lordship understood that the rebels intended to put their Sovereign to death, he, with the Duke of Richmond, the Marquis of Hertford, and the Earl of Southampton, generously offered themselves sacrifices for his Majesty's safety, as having been, by their office of Privy-counsellors, the advisers of the measures im∣puted to him as criminal: and after his Majesty's murder, they obtained licence to attend his interment at Windsor. After that, he compounded for his estate at
<PB N="64" REF="83"/>647l. 13s. 0d. with 300l. per annum settled on the teachers of those times. He afterwards lived privately, expecting and endeavouring the restoration of mo∣narchy, and episcopacy; which being effected, King Charles II. swore him of his Privy-council, and constituted him Lord Lieutenant and Custos Rotulorum of the county of Lincoln, July 16, 1660, and Custos Rotulorum of Oxfordshire, on August 20 following. He was elected a Knight of the most noble Order of the Garter, at a chapter held at Whitehall, April 1, 1661; and was installed at Wind∣sor, April 15 following. At the King's coronation, exhibiting his claim for the exercise of that great hereditary office of Lord High-Chamberlain of England, and for the reception of such fees and benefits as his noble ancestor had heretofore thereupon enjoyed, he accordingly, on that solemn day, executed the said office of Lord High-Chamberlain, and received those fees and benefits, which were of right his due.</P>
<P>This noble and valiant Earl departed this life at Campden-house in Kensington, July 25, 1666, aged fifty-eight years; and was buried at Edenham, in the vault with his noble father.</P>
<P>He had to his first wife, Martha, daughter to Sir William Cockain of Rushton, in the county of Northampton, Knight (ancestor to the Lord Viscount Cullen), widow of John Ramsay, Earl of Holderness; and by her, who died .... July, 1641, had five sons, and three daughters; also by his second wife, Bridget, daughter and sole heir to Edward Wray, Esq. Groom of the Bed-chamber to James I. (third son of Sir William Wray of Glentworth, in the county of Lincoln, Knt. and Bart.) by Elizabeth, his wife, daughter and heir to Francis Lord Norris, Earl of Berkshire, had three sons, and a daughter, Mary, born in 1640, married to Charles Dormer, Earl of Caernarvon: and of the sons by the second wife, James, the eldest, was Lord Norreys by descent, and created Earl of Abington, of whom see further under that title; Edward, who die in his infancy; Henry, the youngest, married Phila∣delphia, daughter to Sir Edward Norris of Weston, in the county of Oxford; of whom more fully under the title of Abingdon. Her Ladyship having lived to a very advanced age, died at Chesterton, in the county of Oxford, in December, 1734, where she was buried. The daughters of the Earl, by his first wife, were: Eliza∣beth, married to Baptist Noel, Viscount Campden; Bridget, to Thomas Osborn, Duke of Leeds; and Catherine, to Robert Dormer, of Dourton, in com. Bucks, Esq.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="84"/>Of his five sons, by the first wife, Robert, the eldest, succeeded to the honours and estate; Peregrine, second son, a Captain in the army, died in 1700, having married Susan, daughter and coheir of Sir Edward Monins of Waldershare, in Kent, Bart. by whom he had that estate, and two daughters: Bridge, wife of John Earl Poulet; and Mary, married, first, to Anthony Henley of the Grange, in com. Southamp. Esq.; and, secondly, to Henry Bertie, Esq. third son of James Earl of Abingdon. Richard, third son, a Captain in the army, was of Creton in Lincoln∣shire, and died unmarried, in 1685. Vere, fourth son, who having, with his next brother, Charles, received the degree of M. A. in 1665, was on June 4, 1675, made a Baron of the Exchequer, and a Justice of the Common Pleas on June 15, 1678; having, previously to his being appointed a Judge, been Secretary to the Treasury, and Treasurer of the Ordnance, but died unmarried, February 13, 1680. Charles, the youngest, was seated at Uffington, in Lincolnshire, and died March 22, 1710, in the seventy-seventh year of his age, and was interred in the chancel of Uffington church, where a monument is erected for him; leaving by Mary, his wife, daughter of Peter Tryon of Harringworth, in com. Northamp. Esq. (and widow of Sir Samuel Jones of Courtenhall, in the same county, Knight), one son, Charles, and a daugh∣ter, Elizabeth, married to Charles Mildmay, Lord Fitz-Walter.

<P>JOHN MURRAY, FIRST EARL OF ANNANDALE, was served heir male, and of talzie, to Sir Richard Murray of Cockpool, his brother german, on the 29th of August, 1637, was the first that had the titles of Viscount Annan, and Earl of Annandale, conferred on him. He was first designed by the title of Lochmaben, then of Dundrenan, &amp;c. and obtained several charters under the great seal by both these titles, before he was advanced to the Peerage. Being a man of singular accom∣plishment, of great worth and merit, and in high favour with King James VI. was chosen one of his attendants to accompany him to England, in 1603. He had the honour of Knighthood conferred on him soon after his arrival, was made one of the Gentlemen of the Bed-chamber, and also appointed Master of the Horse.</P>
<P>And was afterwards raised to the dignity of the Peerage, by the titles of Viscount Annan and Earl of Annandale, by letters patent to the heirs male of his body, dated March 13, 1624. He died in 1640, leaving issue by Elizabeth, his Countess, daughter of John Schaw, Knight, one son,</P>
<P>JAMES, SECOND EARL OF ANNANDALE, who retired into England, where he had lived privately during the time of the civil war in the reign of Charles I. He succeeded also to the honours of Stormont, according to the entail and patent of that family, in 1642. He married Lady Elizabeth Carnegie, daughter of James Earl of Southesk; but dying without issue, in December, 1658, the ho∣nours of Annandale became extinct, but those of Stormont devolved upon the next heir male, according to the patent, and substitution in the entail, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>

<HEAD>JOHNSTON, MARQUIS OF ANNANDALE.</HEAD>
<P>THE ancestors of the Johnstons, on whom this title was conferred, were a bold, in∣trepid, and hardy race of men, and had always distinguished themselves for their bravery in the field; and particularly so in repelling the inroads, or invasions of the English borderers; and with that spirit peculiar to the times, never failed in aveng∣ing the injuries done either to their king or their country. The time that this family began to make a figure in Scotland, was in the reign of Alexander II. about the year 1214; and they soon afterwards became numerous and powerful, and were possessed of considerable estates in many different counties, which appears from unquestion∣able documents and charters under the great seal in the public Register.</P>
<P>Hugo de Johnston was proprietor of lands in East-Lothian, in the reign of King Alexander II. and was father of</P>
<P>John de Johnston, who made a donation to the monastery of Soltry <HI>(pro salute animae suae)</HI> of part of his lands in East-Lothian, of which it seems the family of Keith were superiors; for the donation is confirmed by Robert de Keith, Great Marishal of Scotland, to which Dominus Ricardus de Keith, his brother, Adam de Keith, his uncle, John de Keith, &amp;c. are witnesses. The confirmation is without date, but appears to have been before the year 1285.</P>
<P>Thomas le Johnston, Gilbert de Johnston, and Wauter Johnston, are all found swearing fealty to King Edward I. of England, <HI>inter</HI> 1292 <HI>et</HI> 1296; but we can give no further account of their posterity.</P>
<P>We therefore proceed to deduce the descent of this noble family from their un∣doubted ancestor,</P>
<P>SIR JOHN DE JOHNSTON, was one, with others of the Scotch Barons, that were forced to swear fealty to King Edward I. when he had over-run Scotland, anno 1296, and is then designed, Johannes de Johnston, Chevalier del comitat. de Dum∣fries, &amp;c. The above-named Gilbert is thought to have been his brother. Sir John was father of</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="92"/>JOHN DE JOHNSTON, who flourished in the reign of King Robert Bruce, and is particularly mentioned in a charter of Thomas Ranulph, Earl of Murray, of the lands and barony of Cumlangum, which he gave to his nephew, William de Moravia, &amp;c. the charter must have been granted before 1331, in which year the Earl died. He left issue a son and successor,</P>
<P>GILBERT DE JOHNSTON, who is witness in the same charter with his father to William de Moravia; and dying about the year 1360, was succeeded by his son,</P>
<P>SIR JOHN DE JOHNSTON, who made a great figure in the reigns of King David Bruce and King Robert II. He engaged and defeated a large party of the English, who had invaded the borders of Scotland, anno 1370. He was also one of the Guardians of the West Marches, anno 1371, where he had often an opportu∣nity of exerting his courage and conduct against the English borderers, and was then designed Dominus de Johnston. He died about the year 1382 or 1383, and left issue a son,</P>
<P>SIR JOHN JOHNSTON, designed Dominus de eodem, Miles, who succeeded him. About this time there were forty thousand francs sent by the King of France to be divided amongst the Scotch nobility, his faithful allies, of which Sir John Johnston had three hundred allotted to him for his share, anno 1385.</P>
<P>Sir John, together with Sir John Carlyle, and Sir William Stuart of Castlemilk, were appointed by the Earl of Douglas, then Chief Warden of the Marches, sureties for the keeping of a truce with the English, anno 1398. And dying about the year 1420, was succeeded by his son,</P>
<P>SIR ADAM JOHNSTON, Dominus de eodem, who raised his vassals and followers, joined the Scotch army under the command of the brave Earl of Ormond, and behaved with great spirit and gallantry against the English at the battle of Sark, where the Scots obtained a considerable victory. He, with his sons, Sir John, and Matthew de Johnston, were afterwards very instrumental in suppressing the rebellion of the Earls of Douglas, for which signal act of loyalty and firmness King James II. rewarded him with a grant of the lands of Peddinane, in Lanarkshire, &amp;c.</P>
<P>There is an instrument of seisin of the twenty merk land of Peddinane, granted to Matthew de Johnston, upon a precept from the chancery, proceeding upon a charter from King James II. dated November 19, 1455.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="93"/>This Matthew de Johnston, styled Strenuus Armiger, with his father's men, were the principal means of suppressing the rebellion of the Earl of Douglas, by taking with his own hand the Earl of Ormond, Douglas's brother, prisoner. The Johnstons of Westerhall are lineally descended from him, and bear with the family arms for difference, in memory of that atchievement, a Man's Heart, ensigned with an Imperial Crown, being a part of the armorial bearing of the house of Douglas.</P>
<P>We find that Herbert de Johnston got several lands in the barony of Kirkmichael, in Dumfries-shire, from the Earl of Crawfurd, for liberating his person out of the hands of James Earl of Douglas, who had taken him captive, believing he had in∣tended to desert his interest, and espouse the King's, anno 1462.</P>
<P>This Herbert was also proprietor of some lands in the barony of Bothwel, which he resigned to James Lord Hamilton, in exchange for the lands of Gladstanes, &amp;c. by a charter dated 15th May, 1463.</P>
<P>Sir Adam was often one of the guarantees of treaties of peace with the English, anno 1449, 1451, &amp;c. What family his first wife was of, we have not been able to discover, but by her he had two sons:

He married, secondly, Lady Janet Dunbar, daughter of George Earl of March, widow of John Lord Seton, by whom, it is suppossed, he had two other sons—Her∣bert, before mentioned; and also Sir Gilbert Johnston, who married Agnes, daugh∣ter and sole heiress of Sir William Elphinston, with whom he obtained the lands and barony of Elphingston. He afterwards acquired a charter of the lands of Drumry, "Gilberto de Johnston, de Elphingston, &amp;c. anno 1471," and was one of the guarantees of a treaty of peace with the English, anno 1484. Sir Adam died anno 1455, and was succeeded by his eldest son,</P>
<P>SIR JOHN JOHNSTON, Dominus de eodem, who was one of the conservators of the peace with England, anno 1457. He was also appointed one of the Wardens of the Marches, and guarantees of a truce, anno 1459, and always acted with vigour and intrepidity against the enemies of his country.

HAMILTON, MARQUIS OF ABERCORN.</HEAD>
<P>THE noble family of Hamilton have for many ages eminently distinguished them∣selves, both for their bravery in the field, and for their wisdom in the council; and are equally celebrated in the annals of foreign nations, as in the histories of England, Scotland, and Ireland.</P>
<P>The first of this collateral branch with the title of Abercorn, was James, son of Lord Claud Hamilton, third son of James, second Earl of Arran in Scotland, and Duke of Chatelherault in France, by Lady Margaret Douglas, eldest daugh∣ter of James Earl of Morton, by whom he had four sons, and four daughters:
<LIST>

<ITEM>2. Lord John, who was the first Marquis of Hamilton, and carried on the line of the family;</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Lord Claud, the first of the family of Abercorn.</ITEM>
</LIST>
The names of the other chil∣dren, and their marriages, will be given under the title of Duke of Hamilton.</P>
<P>LORD CLAUD HAMILTON, third son of James Earl of Arran and Duke of Chatelherault, when very young was appointed Commendator of the abbacy of Paisley, upon the resignation of John Archbishop of St. Andrews, anno 1553, which was ratified and approved by Pope Julius III. He was a brave and gallant gentleman, of steady honour, and unchangeable integrity; who, by a series of vir∣tuous actions, reflected lustre on his great ancestors. During the melancholy dis∣cords that prevailed in Scotland, under the unhappy reign of Queen Mary, he adhered to her interest in all her misfortunes. Prompted by his own innate bravery,
<PB N="81" REF="102"/>and his loyalty to his royal mistress, he appeared and distinguished himself in the last effort that was made in her cause at the battle of Langside, anno 1568. In vain he displayed the skill and courage of a great commander: the battle was lost, and proved fatal to the queen's party.</P>
<P>Immediately after the battle, Lord Claud, with many others, were summoned to attend a parliament, called together by the Earl of Murray, then Regent, and, upon his refusal, was outlawed, and his estate forfeited.</P>
<P>During the regency of the Earl of Mar, his lands were given to Lord Semple, who kept a strong garrison in his castle, and exercised all around a severe military discipline, displaying every violence and oppression that power could do, to main∣tain a precarious possession. At length this gallant Lord, supported by his faith∣ful tenants, rose in arms, besieged the castle, and obliged Lord Semple to surrender at discretion.</P>
<P>During the minority of James VI. Lord Claud, with others of his family, were particularly oppressed and so persecuted by the Regent, Morton, that he was obliged to fly to England for safety, not daring to trust the prevailing faction, though his for∣feiture had been repealed by the act of Parliament confirming the pacification of Perth, anno 1573. But when the King took the management of affairs into his own hands, and reflected on the different parties that divided the nation, he soon per∣ceived that the flood of persecution that overwhelmed the Hamiltons, was owing to no other cause than their zealous and steady attachment to his unhappy mother; he therefore restored them to all their estates and honours, and heaped many other favours upon them; in particular, he bestowed upon Lord Claud, and his heirs-male, or assignees, by charter, all the lordship and barony of Paisley, with the appertinents belonging to the abbacy and monastery thereof anno 1585. And, as a further testimony of his esteem and regard for him, he was pleased, in consideration of his constant loyalty, great losses and sufferings, to create him a Peer by the title of Lord Paisley, anno 1587.</P>
<P>His Majesty likewise granted, by another charter, to Lord Claud Hamilton, now Lord Paisley, and his heirs-male whatever, the barony and regality of the burgh of Paisley, &amp;c. anno 1591.</P>
<P>And by another charter, the five pound land of Sanquahar, &amp;c. anno 1593.</P>
<P>This Lord died, advanced in age and character, anno 1621, having married Mar∣garet
<PB N="82" REF="103"/>daughter of George Lord Seton, by whom he had four sons and one daughter.

<P>JAMES, FIRST EARL OF ABERCORN, first son of Claud Lord Paisley, commonly designed Master of Paisley, was a man of eminent parts, and much taken notice of at court. He was highly esteemed by the King, who made him one of the Lords of his Privy-Council, and Gentleman of his Bed-chamber, when he was but a young man; and gave him by a charter, anno 1600, the office of High-Sheriff of the county of Linlithgow, with all the fees &amp;c. thereto belonging, to him and his heirs-male whatever. And by another charter, in 1601, the lands and ma∣nor of Abercorn, Braidmeadows, &amp;c.</P>

Alexan∣der, pretending to assist O'Neile, came to his tent with a small company, when the Scots calling mind the many injuries they had suffered at his hands, cut him to
<PB N="91" REF="112"/>pieces, put all his followers to death, and buried him in ruinous church adjoining; from whence the body was taken by Capt. Piers, who cut off the head, and sent it to the Lord Deputy, then at Drogheda, who caused it to be fixed on the Castle of Dublin.</P>
<P>By patent dated at Wesminster, 14th April, 1573, he was made free denizon of Ireland; acknowledged the Queen's right to the country of Ulster, and crown of Ire∣land; professed obedience, and swore to be a true subject. But notwithstanding this favour from the crown, he assaulted the garrison of Carrickfergus with his company of Scots, in 1575, slew Captain Baker, with his lieutenant, forty soldiers, and some inhabitants; yet, by the courage of the rest, he was obliged to retreat; and Sir Henry Sidney marching thither with 600 horse and foot, 19th October, brought him to terms, and submission. In 1584, during the government of Sir John Perrot, he entertained a number of islanders, joined unto him O'Cahan, and Bryan Carrough, Irish chiefs, resolving to hold what he had acquired by force, viz. the Route, part of the Glynnes, and other lands: But the Deputy Lieutenant took his strong castle of Dunluce, with all his islands and loughs; the next year prevailed on him to sue for his protection, and her Majesty's favour; and 28th June, 1586, indentures were perfected between them for the preservation of the peace. He married Mary, daughter of Con O'Neile, created Earl of Tyrone, and his issue were five sons, viz.

<P>SIR RANDAL MAC-SORLEY, OF DUNLUCE, FIRST EARL OF AN∣TRIM, eldest son of Sorley-Boye, for some time joined Tyrone in his rebellion; but became a singular promoter and patron of civility in his country, which was at that time uncultivated and overrun with the barbarous and savage customs of the wilder natives: and when all the province of Ulster was in the flame of rebellion, he joined Sir Arthur Chichester, in August, 1602, in his journey to the Lieutenant De∣puty, at Tulloghoge; offered to serve the Queen in the expedition against Tyrone, to Fermanagh (where he fled) with 500 foot and 40 horse, at his own charge; made a free and voluntary submission to the Lieutenant Deputy Mountjoy; and, after being honoured by him with Knighthood, demonstrated his fidelity, by performing good
<PB N="92" REF="113"/>and acceptable sevice to the state; of which King James I. was so well satisfied, that he rewarded him with a grant, and confirmation to him and his heirs-male for ever, with divers limitations, by letters patent, bearing date 28th May, 1603, of all the countries and territories, called the Route and the Glynnes, and conferred upon him the dignity of a Viscount; and in his warrant for passing the patent, dated at Green∣wich, 28th May, 1618, thus expresseth himself: "As it is a singular contentment to a King, to see his subjects desire to excel each other in virtues and commendable courses, so there is nothing that does more incite them to such honest contentions amongst themselves than the hopes of honour and advancements, which being long since observed by us, we have at all times heretofore rewared such of our subjects with titles of honour, as we have found deserving servants of the commonwealth; and now having taken into our consideration the many and faithful services, which our trusty and well-beloved Sir Randal Mac-Donnell, Knt. during the troubles of that kingdom, hath, as a valiant gentleman, performed to our crown; and how wisely and worthily he hath since behaved himself, as well for the settling a general peace in that our kingdom, as in reducing to civility the barbarous people of those parts where he doth reside; we are graciously pleased, as an especial mark of our favour towards him, and a reward of his merits in both kinds, to confer upon him the honour and dignity of a Viscount of that our realm, and do hereby require you, &amp;c." The patent was accordingly dated 25th June following, and he was created Viscount of Dunluce, in the presence chamber, within the castle of Dublin, by the Lieutenant Deputy St. John, on St. Peter's day (29th June), after a sermon preached on that oc∣casion; and then carried the sword of state before his Lordship into the city, to a grand entertainment, which he had provided for him.</P>
<P>His Majesty also called him into his Privy-council, gave him the command of a regiment in his army, appointed him Lord Lieutenant of the county of Antrim: and by letters patent under the Great Seal of England, bearing date at Westminster, 12th December, 1620, advanced him to the dignity of Earl of Antrim, with the an∣nual creation fee of 20l. sterling.</P>
<P>On the 14th of July, 1634, he sat first in Parliament; but on the 28th instant fol∣lowing had leave to go into the country during the session, an account of his age and weakness; however, on 4th November following, the first day of the second session, he was again present; and soon after he died at Dunluce, on the 10th December, 1636,
<PB N="93" REF="114"/>and was buried with his ancestors, in Bonamargey. He married Ellice, daughter of Hugh Mac-a-Baron O'Neile, and sister to Hugh, the Earl of Tyrone, by whom he had two sons and five daughters, viz.

<P>RANDAL, THE SECOND EARL AND FIRST MARQUIS OF ANTRIM, was born in the year 1609. Being a nobleman of an high spirit and great activity, he carried a considerable aid in 1639 to King Charles, in his first expedition against the Scots, which being ended in a short time, he attended his Majesty to Oxford; from whence returning to Ireland, he took his seat, 17th June, 1640, in the House of Peers, and, as Lord Clarendon writes, lived in splendor, till the rebellion drove his Lady again from thence, who upon the Queen's first coming to Oxford, accompanied her Majesty, where she found great respect from all: after which, some false reports and aspersions were carried into England, of the Earl's not only joining with the rebels, but of being concerned in the very beginning of the rebellion; but from that malicious charge, Sir William Parsons, one of the Lord Justices, under whose eye he lived at that time in Dublin, wrote into England a vindication of him; and it is certain, he was so far from being any ways engaged in the beginning of the rebellion, that he retired with his Lady from Dublin soon after its commencement, to the Earl of Castlehaven's seat at Maddenstown, near Kildare, and lived there some five or six months in peace and quiet, until after the battle of Kilrush, 15th April, 1642, relieving and entertaining, during that time, many distressed Protestants of the neighbouring
<PB N="94" REF="115"/>country, who doubtless must have perished, had he not saved and sheltered them; and such as were in want, were sent to Dublin, provided with both money and clothes.</P>
<P>Soon after the said battle of Kilrush, the people having threatened to pull down the house over his head, he sent his Lady into England, and going to his estate in 1642, (where he arrived 28th April), betook himself to the rebels in the north, with an ima∣gination, that his quality and fortune would give him the supreme power over them, which he never intended to employ to the prejudice of the King, as appeared plainly from this, that though they were glad of his presence, and to have his name known to be amongst them, yet they had no confidence in him to advise or command them; which proceeded chiefly from the freedom he took in expressing his detestation of their actions and measures, and relieving the miseries and distresses of the British Protestants; particularly those of Coleraine, besieged by the Irish, and in the utmost distress, to whom he did all the good offices, which either his rank, consanguinity, or religion, could enable him to use with success; endeavouring to engage the Irish to raise the siege; and by letters entreated a parley, which being granted, he prevailed so far with their officers, that they promised liberty to the people of the town, to take grazing for their cattle safely for at least three miles compass; after which his Lord∣ship sent into the town about threescore horses loaden with corn, for the benefit of the inhabitants.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding this service, and that by his interest, and among his tenants he raised a regiment, yet Major-General Monroe, commander of the Scots forces, on pretence that some other of his tenants were in the rebellion, (but in reality to gratify his own avarice, by possessing his estate and plundering his house) seized his person, in May, 1642, whilst he was entertaining him in his castle of Dunluce, and sent him prisoner to Carrickfergus; whence having the good fortune to make his escape into the northern parts of England, he waited on the Queen then at York; who, to promote the cessation of arms with the Irish (then become absolutely necessary, by the extremities to which the army was reduced) sent his Lordship to Ireland, with letters and instructions to that purpose: but he was again taken by Monroe, the very instant of his landing, in the county of Downe, and imprisoned in Carrickfergus.</P>
<P>After some months restraint, he recovered his liberty by a second escape into Eng∣land, and arrived at Oxford 16th December, 1643, where his presence was not unac∣ceptable: Monroe all the while enjoying his estate, and refusing to allow him or his
<PB N="95" REF="116"/>agents to receive the rents of it, though repeated orders were sent from the King and the state of Ireland for that purpose.</P>
<P>He was no sooner arrived at Oxford, but the Marquis of Montrose proposing a scheme for raising such a body of the King's friends in Scotland, to oppose the Cove∣nanters, who were then in a treaty with the Parliament, as should oblige the Scots army to return out of England, if he had but some troops to begin with, and to serve for a pretension to the Royalists that should join him, consulted with the Earl of Antrim, whether it might not be possible to draw a body of men out of Ireland, to be such a foundation for raising the said forces in Scotland, as might advance the enterprise he had so long inhis heart, of doing the King service in the north, and protecting the Royalists that would join him in his undertaking. The Earl of Antrim readily un∣dertook, that if the King would grant him a commission, he would raise an army in Ireland, and transport it into Scotland, and would himself be at the head of it; by means whereof, all the clan of the Mac-Donnells in the Highlands might be per∣suaded to follow him.</P>
<P>Upon this overture, the King conferred with the two noblemen together, and knowing well that the Earl of Antrim had interest enough to raise as many men as should be desired in that part of the kingdom, his Majesty resolved to encourage it all he could; which he did by creating him Marquis of Antrim, by Privy-seal, dated at Oxford, 26th January, 1644, 20 Car. I. with the creation fee of 40l. a year, issuing out of the customs of the port of Coleraine. Having received this ho∣nour, and the King's commission, he began his journey to raise the intended forces, to be sent into Scotland in April, 1644; but in the execution of his designs, unfore∣seen difficulties often arising to retard them, he could not raise them so expeditiously, nor make good his undertaking effectually, without the assistance or countenance of the supreme council at Kilkenny; to recommend himself to whom, he took the oath of association, and was made a member of that body; whereby, with the Marquis of Ormond's concurrence, he sent off, 27th June, 1644, about 1500 men, under the com∣mand of Colonel Alexander Mac-Donnell; who, landing about the end of July in the islands, were recieved by the Marquis of Montrose, and by their brave behaviour laid the foundation of all the great enterprises he undertook, and the amazing victories he gained, in all which they constantly accompanied him.</P>
<P>From this time till the month of February, 1647, we have no public mention of
<PB N="96" REF="117"/>the Marquis of Antrim, when he was appointed, by the general assembly at Kilkenny, one of their three agents to the Queen and Prince in France, to desire a Lord Lieute∣nant might be sent into Ireland. He returned in September, 29th of which month the Marquis of Ormond landed Lord Lieutenant, at Cork, and, 17th January, 1648, concluded a peace with the supreme council: but the Pope's nuncio declaring against it, he was soon forced again to leave the kingdom; yet the Marquis of Antrim, and Owen O'Neile adhering to him, stood it out against the peace; and at length, the Marquis entered into an intrigue with Cromwell, from whom, in 1651, he had an assignment of 500l. a year, and his protection from being arrested or imprisoned dur∣ing his stay in the Parliament's quarters; having, in 1655, 800l. per annum allowed him, yet he did not forget his duty to his Prince, which he expressed by assisting him with arms and ammunition, when he was in the west of England; and after his forces were defeated at Worcester, furnished him with ships to make his escape into foreign parts. For which, and other considerations, he was retored to his estate, by the acts of settlement; and at length, after much difficulty, received a confirmation thereof by two patents under the Great Seal.</P>
<P>He married, to his first wife in April, 1635, the Lady Catharine Manners, daugh∣ter and heir to Francis, Earl of Rutland, widow of George Villiers, the great Duke of Buckingham; and to his second, Rose, daughter of Sir Henry O'Neile, of Eden∣duffecarrick, otherwise Shane's Castle, in the county of Antrim, Knight, by his wife Martha, daughter of Sir Francis Stafford, Governor of Ulster, but having no issue by either, and dying the 3d February, 1682, he was buried in Bonamargey; the title of Marquis became extinct, and the Earldom devolved on his brother</P>
<P>ALEXANDER, THE THIRD EARL OF ANTRIM, who was born in the year 1615, and being twenty-one years of age at his father's death, travelled into France, Germany, Italy, and other places; whence arriving about the beginning of the troubles of 1641, he waited on the King at York; after which he returned to Ire∣land, and sided with the Irish of his own religion, in whose army (in 1642) he commanded a regiment; but was ever averse, during that war, to any act of cruelty, or oppression; was a constant friend to pacific measures, laboured to bring the con∣federates to their due obedience, and firmly adhered to the peace of 1648, which his brother warmly opposed. But he was attainted of treason, which attainder being reversed after the restoration, he was restored to his estate by the act of explanation.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="118"/>In the years 1660, 1661, 1678, 1681 and 1685, he served in the English Parlia∣ment for Wigan in Lancashire; was appointed, 1st December, 1680, Custos Rot. of the county of Antrim; sworn in 1685 of the Privy-council to King James II. who made him Lord Lieutenant of the said county, and gave him the command of a regiment of foot, for which he was attainted high treason, but was afterwards ad∣judged to be comprised within the articles of Limerick; in consequence whereof his whole estate, if any part thereof was seized upon, was restored to him; and 2d Dec. 1697, the committee of the H. of Lords reported that this outlawry had been reversed.</P>
<P>His first wife was the Lady Elizabeth Annesley, second daughter of Arthur, first Earl of Anglesey, who dying in September, 1669, without issue, was buried in St. John's church, Dublin; he married, secondly, Helena, third daughter of Sir John Burke, of Derrymaclaghtny, in the county of Galway, Knight, and deceasing in England, anno 1699, left issue by her, who died, 7th October, 1710, and was buried in Christ-church, one son, Randal, his successor, and one daughter, Mary, married in August, 1700, to Henry Wells of Bambridge, in the county of Southampton, Esq. nephew to the late Lord Chancellor Wyndham.</P>
<P>RANDAL, FOURTH EARL OF ANTRIM, was born in 1680, married Ra∣chel, eldest daughter of Clotworthy, Lord Viscount of Massereene; and dying 19th October, 1721, was buried in Christ-church, having issue by his Lady, one son, Alexander, and one daughter, Lady Helena Mac-donnell, who died unmarried in June, 1783, aged 78.</P>
<P>ALEXANDER, FIFTH EARL OF ANTRIM, born 22d July, 1713, was left by his father under the guardianship of the Lord and Lady Dowager Massereene, who took care of his education, and brought him up in the established Protestant religion, to which the noble family of Skeffington had long been a singular ornament. On the 17th of October, 1733, he took his seat in the House of Peers; after which he was a Privy-counsellor, and Governor of the county of Antrim.</P>
<P>His Lordship, 10th April, 1735, married, first, Elizabeth, daughter of Matthew Pennefather, Esq. some time Muster-master General, and after Comptroller and Ac∣comptant-general of Ireland till his death, which happened 27th November, 1733. By her he had one daughter, born 7th February, 1735, which died soon after its birth; and she deceasing 18th March, 1736, in the twenty-fifth year of her age, was interred the 22d, in the family vault at Christ-church. He married, secondly,
<PB N="98" REF="119"/>2d January, 1739, Anne, eldest daughter and heir to Charles-Patrick Plunket, of Dil∣lonstown, in the county of Lowth, Esq.

<P>UNDER the Title of the Duke of Ancaster, will be found the genealogy of this family. The first of this noble branch, who had the title of Earl of Abingdon, was James Bertie, Lord Norreys of Rycote, eldest son of Montagu Bertie (the second Earl of Lindsey) by Bridget his second wife, Baroness Norreys of Rycote, widow of Edward Sackville, second son of Edward fourth Earl of Dorset, and daughter and sole heir to Edward Wray, Esq. Groom of the Bed-chamber to King James I. (third son to Sir William Wray, of Glentworth in the county of Lincoln, Knight and Baronet) by Elizabeth his wife, sole daughter and heir to Francis Norris, or Norreys, Lord Norreys, Viscount Thame, and Earl of Berkshire; and the Barony of Norreys de∣scending to him, as heir to his mother, he was, by reason of his illustrious descent, and eminent services to King Charles II. faithfully performed, (as his patent sets forth) created Earl of Abingdon, on November 30th, 1682, 34 Charles II.</P>
<P>The other children, by the said Montagu, Earl of Lindsey, by his second wife, were, 2. Edward, who died young; and 3. the honourable Captain Henry Bertie; and Lady Mary, married to Charles Dormer, second Earl of Caernarvon, who died without issue male, on November 29th, 1709.</P>
<P>Captain Henry, before mentioned, (who was Member for the city of Oxford, in 1685, 1689, and 1690) married Philadelphia, daughter of Sir Edward Norreys, of Weston-on-the-Green, in the county of Oxford, and by her had issue two sons and three daughters.
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. James, married Elizabeth, daughter to Roger Harris, of the city of Winchester, Esq. and by her left one son, Norreys Bertie, Esq. who inherited

The said Captain Henry married to his second wife —, sister to Sir Henry Featherstone, Baronet, but by her left no issue; and departing this life at Chesterton in Oxfordshire, in December, 1734, was there buried.</P>
<P>The aforesaid Lord Norreys of Rycote, JAMES BERTIE, FIRST EARL OF ABINGDON, was Lord Lieutenant of the county of Oxford, from the year 1674, to the year 1687. His Lordship was one of those Peers who, in 1688, joined in the invitation to William, Prince of Orange, and depended so much on his Highness acting the part of a disinterested mediator between King James and the people, that he contributed 30,000l. towards his expedition: but when he suspected that his Highness aimed at the crown, he did all in his power to oppose his views; and not only gave his own vote against declaring the throne vacant, and filling it with the Prince and Princess of Orange, but exerted his influence with his friends to concur with him. However, being a nobleman of respectable character, it was thought proper to nominate him Lord Lieutenant and Custos Rotulorum of the said county of Oxford; and he continued in those offices till 1697, though he strenuously op∣posed the favourite measures of the court. His Lordship was also Chief Justice in Eyre of all the royal forests, &amp;c. south of Trent, and High-steward of the city of Oxford.</P>

However, upon another change of the ministry, in 1710, he was constituted Chief Justice and Justice in Eyre, of all her Majesty's forests, chaces, parks, &amp;c. on the south side of Trent; and was again sworn of her Majesty's Privy-council; and on May 17th, 1712, constituted Lord Lieutenant of Oxfordshire.</P>
<P>At the demise of the Queen, he was one of the nineteen Lords Justices nominated by her successor (pursuant to an act of parliament) for the government of the king∣dom till his arrival from Hanover: and a new Privy-council being appointed by his Majesty to meet on October 1st, 1714, he was sworn thereof.

<PB N="104" REF="125"/>south of Trent: but his Lordship kept those places but a short time; being no friend to the measures of the administration, which he opposed with great spirit in that and the succeeding reign, as may be seen from the debates and protests in the House of Peers.</P>
<P>His Lordship married first Anne, daughter and heir to Peter Venables, Baron of Kinderton, who left him a widower on April 28th, 1715, and was buried at Rycote in Oxfordshire, with this inscription on her tomb: "The Right Honourable Anne Countess of Abingdon, Baroness of Kinderton, daughter and heiress to Peter Venables, Baron of Kinderton, by his wife Catherine Shirley, one of the daughters of Sir Robert Shirley, and sister of the present Earl Ferrers of Chartley.</P>

<P>She was born 7th of May, A. D. 1674, and married the two and twentieth of Sept. 1687, to Montagu Lord Norreys, eldest son and heir to James late Earl of Abingdon, whom he succeeded in his estate and honours, A. D. 1699.</P>
<P>She was Lady of the Bedchamber to her late Majesty Queen Anne, from the first of her reign, till the death of that excellent Queen, by whom she was highly re∣garded, and from whom she received such constant marks of a particular affection, that when her Majesty was prevailed on to displace her Lord, with the rest of the nobility and gentry of the same loyal principles, all possible means were tried in vain, by those then in great power, to get her removed.</P>
<P>Yet her love and duty to her Lord made her choose to quit the court, and ac∣company him in his retirement; till in a more happy juncture of affairs, he was re∣stored to his employments, and she returned to her attendance on the best of Queens: from which time she continued ever near to her till her Majesty's death, which happened August the first, 1714, which but a little time preceded, and perhaps has∣tened her own. She died April the twenty-eighth, 1715. Her Body is here buried in peace, but her Name (we trust) liveth for evermore."</P>

<HEAD>KEPPEL, EARL OF ALBEMARLE.</HEAD>
<P>ARNOLD-JOOST VAN KEPPEL, created Earl of Albemarle, was descended of an ancient family in Guelderland, one of the United Provinces, being a younger son of Bernard van Pallant, Lord of Keppel, by Agnes-Charlotte-Elizabetha his wife, daughter to Jacob van Wassenar, Lord of Opdam. His elder brother the Baron Pal∣lant, and Lord of Keppel, was killed at the battle of Eckeren, June 30th, N.S. 1703, unmarried: and his younger brother Rabo, who was Lieutenant General in the service of the States-general, Colonel of a regiment of foot, Postmaster-general of the province of Guelderland, Bailiff of Boisleduc, and one of the Nobles of the province of Over-Issel, died in 1733, leaving issue one son, Arnold-Joost.</P>
<P>The said Arnold Joost, who was created Earl of Albemarle, attended King Wil∣liam into England, in the year 1688 (being then page of honour to his Highness) and was afterwards made one of the Grooms of his bed-chamber, and Master of the robes. On March 25th (N. S.) 1691, being one of the Grooms of the Kings Bed∣chamber, he was sent from the Hague to compliment the Elector of Bavaria, on his arrival in Flanders; and attending on his Majesty in several campaigns, wherein he distinguished himself by his courage and fidelity, he was by letters-patent, bear∣ing date Feb. 10th, 1695-6, 8 William III. created Baron Ashford, of Ashford in Kent, Viscount Bury, in com' pal. Lanc. and Earl of Albemarle. He was a Major-general, before the year 1697; when his Majesty, in his camp at Pamelles, June 17th, ordered, the Earl of Albemarle, with a considerable detachment, to cover the left wing of the army which foraged towards Louvain.</P>
<P>In the year 1699, on the resignation of the Earl of Scarborough, he was constituted Colonel of the first troop of horse-guards. On July 14, 1699, he introduced the Sieur Galesky, Envoy from the King of Poland, to a private audience of his Majes∣ty, in his bed-chamber at Loo, in Holland; which fine seat that King afterwards made him a present of. On May 14th, 1700, he was elected one of the Knights
<PB N="111" REF="134"/>companions of the most noble order of the Garter, being then one of the Lords of the bed-chamber to his Majesty, and was installed at Windsor on June 5th following.</P>
<P>King William held his Lordship in the highest esteem, and bequeathed to him, in a codicil annexed to his last will and testament, the Lordship of Breevost, and 200,000 guilders, the only legacy he gave from the Prince of Nassaw Friezland, whom his Majesty made his heir. In September, 1701, his Lordship, with the Earl of Galway, reviewed the forces encamped on the Moerdike, near Nimeguen, and continuing there, and at the Hague, set out from thence, in March 1701-2, to view the frontier places against the French. And receiving there the melancholy news of the King's decease, he arrived in England June 26, 1702.</P>
<P>His Lordship having waited on the Queen, and being deeply affected with the death of his royal master, retired to his native country, and on his arrival in Holland, took his place, as a member of the Nobles, in the Assembly of the States-general. In 1702, he was declared General of the Dutch forces; and taking his leave of the States-general at the Hague, August 3d, joined the army on the 7th.</P>
<P>In 1705, he came into England, and attending on the Queen, when she visited the University of Cambridge, he was, on April 16th created Doctor of Laws there. He returned to Holland soon after; and on June 11th, left the Hague to join the army under Monsieur Aberquerque; being also that year at the forcing of the French lines near Tirlemont, July 18th, N. S. He was at the battle of Ramellies, May 23d, N. S. next year, and took up his winter quarters at Brussels. On April 20th, 1708, the States-general declared his Lordship General of Horse; and on July 11th, that year, he was in the memorable battle of Oudenard; and soon after, Augustus King of Poland, and the Landgrave of Hesse-Cassel, arriving in the camp at Hel∣chin, the Duke of Marlborough entertained them, August, 19th, with the review of the first line of his army; after which they dined with the Earl of Albemarle. At the siege of Lisle, the Duke of Marlborough having advice that thirty of the enemy's squadrons were marched through Tournary to intercept a convoy of ammunition, sent out from Brussels for the siege, the Earl of Albemarle was immediately or∣dered to march with the like number of squadrons towards Gramont, for secu∣rity of that convoy, and to take 1000 horse more from Oudenard, if necessary. And accordingly his Lordship brought the convoy safe to Menin, and joined the army, September 12th. After which the French investing Brussels during the siege
<PB N="112" REF="135"/>of Lisle, the Duke of Marlborough having passed the Scheld to its relief, raised the siege: but encountering with a party of the enemy, under M. de Hautefort, Nov. 28th, 1708, his Lordship's horse was shot under him. In 1710, he had her Majes∣ty's leave to dispose of his troop of horse-guards, which by her favour, he had hi∣therto kept; and accordingly (for a valuable consideration) by agreement between him and the Earl of Portland, the Queen conferred it on that Earl, who was after∣wards created Duke of Portland. On August 27th, 1711, the Earl of Albemarle, with nine battalions and 1100 horse, conducted the second convoy of ammunition and artillery to the siege of Bouchain: and commanding at the battle of Denain, July 24th, 1712, N. S. was made prisoner, but soon released. Prince Eugene, arriving at the Hague, on November 2d following, toop up his abode in his Lordship's house, till one he had taken was fitted up, for the winter season. On the demise of Queen Anne, August 1st, 1714, his Lordship was sent by the States-general to Hanover, to congratulate her successor on his happy accession to the crown of these realms: and, after his return, was one of those Noblemen deputed by their High Mightinesses, to receive the King, and his Royal Highness the Prince, in September, on the fron∣tiers of the United Provinces. His Lordship had also the honour to entertain them at his fine seat at Voorst; and in October, that year, when the Princess of Wales (the late Queen Caroline) came from Hanover, she was received and attended by his Lordship to Rotterdam, where she embarked for England. In 1716, his Lordship continuing his instances in favour of such of the Swiss, in the Dutch service, who were not on the foot of stipulation, with any of the Cantons, they were, by his endeavours, kept in their service, the battalion, of which he was Colonel, being of that number. In 1717, he was nominated by the Nobles of Holland, to compliment the Czar Peter on his arrival: and he was received and complimented by his Lord-ship, at Amsterdam, August 2d, 1717.</P>
<P>His Lordship was a member of the Nobles of Holland, as also Deputy-Forester of that province, General of the horse, and of Swissers, in the service of the States-general, Governor of Boisleduc, Colonel of a regiment of Carabiniers, and of a regi∣ment of Swissers; and departed this life, very much regretted, in the 48th year of his age, at the Hague, on May 30th, N.

On July 2d, N. S. 1747, he was with his Royal Highness in the battle of Vall; in the account whereof, pub∣lished in our Gazettes, it is recited, that the Earl of Albemarle did all that could be expected from an officer, as the behaviour of the British infantry (then under his command) shewed. In 1748, he again went over with his Royal Highness; and soon after the conclusion of the peace, his Lordship was appointed Ambassador and Plenipotentiary to the French court; being then General in chief of the forces in Scotland. On July 12th, 1750, he was installed, at Windsor, a Knight of the most noble order of the Garter, by his proxy, Sir Charles Eggleton, Knight; and after∣wards coming into England, was, July 12th, 1751, sworn of his Majesty's most honorable Privy-council, and took his place at the board accordingly, being then Groom of the Stole to his Majesty.

On December 11th, 1744, hewas made Captain of one of his Majesty's ships, and during the remainder of the war, took several of the enemy's privateers. In 1751, he was Commodore of a squadron in the Mediterranean; and on May 1st, that year, sailed from fort St. Philip's in the Island of Minorca, to settle the differences between the English Merchants and the Dey of Algiers. On his arrival, the Dey acknowledged to him, "That one of his officers had been guilty of a very great fault, which tended to embroil him with his chiefest and best friends; wherefore he should never more serve him by sea or land; and hoped the King, his master, would look on it as the ac∣tion of a fool or a madman, and he would take care nothing should happen again in the like nature, that they may be better friends than ever." Which declaration was sent to England, and published by order of the Lords of the Admiralty, May 22d, 1751. He also concluded treaties with the states of Tripoly, and Tunis; and before the end of the year 1752, he arrived at Portsmouth, from the Mediterranean, with all the ships under his command, having been upwards of three years on that station.</P>
<P>This gallant seaman having further signalized himself by his courage and conduct upon every occasion, after the rupture with France in 1755, was pitched upon to con∣duct the second expedition against the island of Gorée, on the western coast of Africa, being at the same invested with the command of the land forces destined for that enterprize, consisting of the second battalion of George Lord Forbes's regi∣ment (76th) of foot on the Irish establishment: and, after several delays and mis∣fortunes, arriving off the said island on December, 28th, 1758, employed his time so well, that Mr. St. Jean, the French Governor, with the garrison, surrendered at discretion the next day. Commodore Keppel, having sent off the French captives, and placed a sufficient number of British troops for the defence of the Island, under Major Newton, departed, on January 12th, 1759, for Senegal (which had been reduced by Commodore Marsh, and Major Mason, in May preceding, before their unsuccessful attempt upon Gorée) and there reinforced the garrison, leaving Lieutenant-colonel Richad Worge (who had come out with him) Governor, in the place of Major Mason. When Mr. Keppel had sufficiently provided for the security of these African conquests, he set sail for England, on January 23d, and arriving at Spithead on March 3d, proceeded to London, where he was most graciously received by his
<PB N="116" REF="142"/>Majesty. After that, he was employed in the bay of Biscay, under Sir Edward Hawke, and was with that brave officer, when he defeated the French fleet, command∣ed by M. Conflans, on November 20th, 1759, off Belleisle; on which occasion Mr. Keppel, in the Torbay of 74 guns, engaged and sunk the Theseus, carrying the same number of guns, but of a greater caliber. In February 1760, he was nominated Co∣lonel of the Plymouth division of marines. The conquest of Belleisle being con∣certed, Commodore Keppel had the command of the squadron appointed for the cover of the siege; and sailing from Spithead on March 29th, 1761, contributed, by his prudence and bravery, not only to making good the landing of the troops in that month, but also to the reduction of the citadel fo Palais, the capital of that island, on June 7th following; the military operations at which did infinite honour to the be∣siegers and besieged. When the British ministry, after the declaration of war against Spain, on January 4th, 1762, resolved on the conquest of the city of Havan∣nah, in the island of Cuba, Mr. Keppel was nominated to act as Commodore, in that important service, under that experienced and gallant officer Sir George Pococke, Knight of the Bath; who sailed from St. Helen's on March 5th, 1762. When the British fleet arrived off that island, on June 6th, Sir George appointed Mr. Keppel to remain eastward of the Havannah, with seven sail of the line, and some small fri∣gates, to protect and conduct the debarkation of the forces: and in his letters to the Lords of the Admiralty, dated July 14th, and August the 19th, acquainted their Lordships, that Commodore Keppel executed the duty entrusted to him with an ac∣tivity, judgment, and diligence, no one man could surpass. After that place surren∣dered to the British Arms on August 13th, he was promoted to the rank of Rear Ad∣miral of the Blue, in November that year, and was very successful in taking many va∣luable prizes, both French and Spanish. At the general election, in 1761, he was returned one of the members for Windsor, having served in the former parliament for Chichester, in the room of his brother, when he succeeded to the Peerage, then one of the Grooms of his Majesty's bedchamber.</P>
<P>At the commencement of the last war with France, he was appointed Admiral of the British fleet, and cruising in the Channel, he met with the French fleet off Ushent, under the command of the Duke de Chartres; an engagement took place in the afternoon; but night coming on soon after, hostilities ceased, to be renewed on the morning with redoubled vigour; but in the dead of the night, the French availed themselves of its
<PB N="117" REF="143"/>darkness, and retreated with such precipitation, that on the break of day very few of their ships could be discovered. When intelligence arrived in England of their escape from the superior fleet under his command, it created much clamour and dis∣content, and great blame was imputed to him: however, on his return, he spiritedly demanded a trial, by court martial, which being acceeded to, it accordingly took place, and, after a full hearing, he was honourably acquitted. The citizens of Lon∣don, as a testimony of their approbation, voted and presented him with the freedom of the city in a gold box; and further, to shew the respect they bore him for the pro∣tection of their homeward bound merchant ships, ordered a sumptuous entertainment to be provided at the London Tavern in honour of him, to which he and several other naval officers of distinction were invited; and on his entering the city, the horses were taken from the carriage, and he was drawn by his seamen through the streets, amidst the acclamations of a vast multitude of people who had assembled on the occasion.</P>
<P>On the 22d of April, 1782, he was advanced to the Peerage by the title of Vis∣count Keppel, of Elveden, in the county of Suffolk, but dying without issue the title became extinct.</P>
<P N="3">3. James, who died young.</P>
<P N="4">4. William, Gentleman of the horse to his late Majesty; on December 21st, 1752, was made a Captain in the first regiment of foot-guards, with the rank of Lieu∣tenant-colonel. On July 21st, 1760, he was nominated 2d Major of that regiment, with the rank of Colonel of foot; and in January, 1762, had the command of the 56th regiment of infantry, with which he embarked in March following in the fleet fitted out against the Havannah, having the rank of Major-general in that expedition. On August 14th, the day after the capitulation for the surrendering of the Havannah, he took possession of the fort La Punta; and being left commander, after his eldest brother sailed for Europe, re-delivered the possession of the city of Havannah to the Spanish troops, on July 7th, 1763, according to the articles of peace, concluded at Paris, February 10th preceding; soon after which, he embarked for England, and, after a short voyage landed at Portsmouth. He died unmarried in March 1782, being then a Lieutenant-general in the army, and Colonel of the Prince of Wales's regiment of light dragoons.</P>

Being appointed a member of the Privy-council, and Governor of the island of Jersey, he took the usual oath, and his seat at the Council-board, on January 28th, 1761, and at the same time had the oaths administered to him, as Governor of the said island. on February 1st, 1756, his Lordship was advanced to the rank of Major-general, and to that of Lieutenant-general, on April 1st, 1759.

OGILVIE, EARL OF AIRLY.</HEAD>
<P>GILBERT, second son of Gilibred, and brother of Gilchrist, Earl of Angus, a man of high distinction, in the reign of King William the Lyon, who succeeded to the crown of Scotland, anno 1165, and died anno 1214. He obtained from that prince, a charter, <HI>Gilberto filio comitis de Angus, terrarum de Pourin, Ogilvie, et Kyneithin, per suas rectas divisas, pro servitio unius militis, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>He is a frequent witness in his brother Earl of Gilchrist's charters to the abbacy of Arbroath, particularly to one granted by him to that convent, of the church of Mo∣nyfod (now Monifeith). The charter is without date; but as John, bishop of Aber∣deen, is also a witness, it must have been granted on or before 1207, in which year that bishop died.</P>
<P>This GILBERT assumed his sirname from his lands and barony of Ogilvie, as was the custom of those early times; and from him we proceed by indisputable evidence, to deduce the descent of this noble family. He had a son.</P>
<P>ALEXANDER DE OGILVIE, who succeeded him, and was one of the inquest, who judicially declares, that the lands of Innerpeffer were held of, and owed suit of court to the abbot of Arbroath, &amp;c. dated at Forfar, February 17th, 1250. He was succeeded by his son,</P>

We therefore return to.</P>
<P>PATRICK DE OGILVIE, of Wester Pourie, second son of the above Sir Patrick, who obtained from his nephew, Sir Patrick Ogilvie, son of his brother Alexander, to him, and Marjory his wife, the lands of Wester Pourie, <HI>in vicecom. de Forfar, quam quondam Malcolmus de Pourie tenuit et possedit, &amp;c.</HI> His marriage with the above Marjory, only daughter, and at length sole heiress of Sir Robert Ramsay of Auchterhouse, hereditary Sheriff of the county of Forfar, brought a considerable ad∣dition, both of wealth and dignity, to his family.

GORDON, EARL OF ABERDEEN.</HEAD>
<P>IT is highly probable that this noble family is descended from the great and illus∣trious house of Gordon, whose origin, grandeur, and antiquity, will be fully set forth under the title of the Duke of Gordon, yet we cannot pretend to ascertain their first ancestor.</P>
<P>Mr. Crawfurd, in his lives of the officers of state, mentions Sir William Gordon, who swore fealty to King Edward I. for some lands in the shire of Berwick, anno 1296; and alleges that these were the lands of Coldingknows, the ancient inheritance of the family of Haddo, &amp;c. and that this Sir William obtained afterwards sundry lands from King Robert Bruce, in reward of his great and faithful services; he appears to have been uncle to Alicia, the heiress of Gordon; and that he had a Scotland, with his cousin Sir Adam, when he acquired the lands of Strathbogie, from King Robert I. That this second Sir William married the daughter and sole heiress of John de Citharista, Lord of the barony of Methlic; and that he was the ancestor of this noble family, &amp;c. So far Mr Crawfurd.</P>
<P>But as we cannot exactly connect the Gordons of Coldingknows with these of Methlic and Haddo, of whom there are authentic records for above 300 years, we shall proceed to deduce their descent from undoubted authority.</P>
<P>PATRICK GORDON, of Methlic, lived in the reign of King James I. and made a great figure in Scotland in the beginning of the reign of King James II. to whom he bore a firm and steady attachment. He joined the King's forces, under the com∣mand
<PB N="131" REF="157"/>of his cousin the Earl of Huntly, against the Earl of Crawfurd, and lost his life in the cause, at the battle of Arbroath, anno 1445. He left issue, a son and suc∣cessor,</P>
<P>JAMES GORDON of Methlic, who obtained from King James II. on account of his father's great merit and faithful services, a grant of a part of the barony of Kelly, then vested in the Crown, by the forfeiture of Alexander Earl of Crawfurd. And being a man of great oeconomy, he acquired several other lands, which are still in the possession of the family. He married—, daughter of—, by whom he had is∣sue, five sons and two daughters.

<P>HENEAGE FINCH, LORD GUERNSEY, AND EARL OF AILESFORD, was the second son of Heneage, Earl of Nottingham; under which title will be found the descent of the Earl of Ailesford. After his education in Christ-church, Oxford, he was entered in the Inner Temple, for the study of the laws, wherein he was such a proficient, that on January 13th, 1678, he was constituted his Majesty's Solicitor-general; from which office he was removed by James II. on April 21st, 1686. He was afterwards the principal of those eminent counsel, who pleaded in behalf of the seven Bishops, who were tried on June 29th, in Trinity-term, 1688, for refusing to authorize the reading King James's declaration for abrogating test and penal laws, and on that account were committed to the Tower. On which occasion Mr. Finch argued strenuously against their commitment, and the power of the King in dispensing with the laws mentioned in that declaration; and that the Lords the Bishops could not in prudence, honour, or conscience, so far make themselves parties to it, as the solemn publication thereof in the time of divine service (as they were commanded) must amount to.</P>

<P>Bertram de Esburnham, son of Anchitel, son of Piers, Lord of Esburnham, was Sheriff of the counties of Surry, Sussex, and Kent, and Constable of Dover Castle, in the reign of King Harold, which castle he defended against William the Conqueror, wherefore William, on his accession to the crown of England, caused his head to be struck off, together with the heads of his sons Phillip and Michael de Esburnham. Francis Thyn, Esq. in 1586, collected a catalogue of the Lord-wardens of the Cinque Ports, and Constables of Dover Castle, from the time of William the Conqueror; and makes this mention of the ancestor of this family: "Bertram Ashburnham, a Baron of Kent. was Constable of Dover Castle in the year of Christ 1066, being (as is said) the first and last year of King Harold; which Bertram was beheaded by Wil∣liam the Conqueror, after he had obtained the crown, because he did so valiantly de∣fend the same against the Duke of Normandy."</P>
<P>Philip de Esburnham, left issue Reginald, whose son Stephen de Esburnham, confirms to the church of St. Martin of Battle, and to the Monks there serving God, for the health of his soul, and the souls of his ancestors and successors, the gift which Reginald de Esburnham his father gave for ever, in pure and free alms, viz. all that land which they had in Hou, called Cheliland, with the land which he gave in
<PB N="140" REF="170"/>Denne, with two salt-works in the marsh belonging to the said land, with all other appurtenances in wood, in plain, and in marsh, to hold for ever in pure alms.</P>
<P>To this Stephen succeeded Sir John de Eseburnham, whose son Sir Richard de Esseburnham, Knight, married Margaret, daughter of Sir John Maltravers, Knight, and had issue Richard; which Richard was also a Knight, and lived in King John's reign; and in the reign of Henry III. held two Knights fees of Anne Countess of Ewe (wife of Ralph de Isondon, son of Geffry Luzignan Earl of Acquitain) as of the honour of Hastings. He married Catharine, daughter of Sir Richard Peverell, Knight, by whom he had issue, Bartholomew and Hammond, the first of which was a Knight, and held in 38 Henry III. 20l. per ann. land of the King in chief, and thereupon was summoned to be at London in Easter, which horse and arms, from thence to march to Portsmouth, in order to be transported into Gascony, in the King's service, to oppose the King of Castile, who had committed hostilities in those parts.</P>
<P>Hammond, his brother, who was also a Knight, married Maud, daughter of Thomas Elton, of Elton, in the county of Sussex, and had issue, Sir Richard Es∣burnham, who by Isabel, daughter of Sir Thomas Morville, had issue Roger Esburn∣ham, and Sir John Esburnham, Knight, who in 25th of Edward I. was summoned to attend the King at London, on the Sunday after the Octave of St. John Baptist with horse and arms, to go with him beyond the seas, for his own honour, and the profit of the realm. He married Joan, daughter of Richard Covert, of Sullington, in the county of Sussex, and had issue John, his son and heir, who married Maud, daughter of— Isley, of Sundridge, in Kent, and had issue one son, of his own name, John Ash∣burnham, who was Sheriff of the counties of Surry and Sussex in 3 Henry IV. and in 3 Henry V. was appointed one of the Commissioners of Array in the county of Sussex. This John by Elizabeth his wife, daughter of—Finch, had issue Thomas Ashburn∣ham, Esq. who, in the 12th year of King Henry VI. was one of those of prime quality in the county of Sussex, that made oath for the observance of the laws then made, for himself and retainers. He married Sarah, daughter and heir of Henry Wauncy, lineally descended from Sir Nicholas de Wauncy, Sheriff of Surry and Sussex in 34 Henry III. His issue by her were three sons; John Ashburnham of Ashburnham, Esq. Richard Ashburnham, second son, who married —, daughter and heir to — Stoneling, of Stoneling in Sussex, and was ancestor to Sir William Ashburn∣ham of Bromham in Sussex, Baronet, who married Margaret, daughter of Sir Ni∣cholas
<PB N="141" REF="171"/>Pelham of Catsfield, in the same county; also to the Right Rev. William Lord Bishop of Chichester, A. D. 1754, who on the decease of Sir William Ash∣burnham, November 7th, 1755, succeeded to the title of Baronet.</P>
<P>Thomas Ashburnham, third son, was seated at Gesseling in Sussex, as appears by his will dated April 12th, 1523, whereby he orders his body to be buried before the image of our Lady in the parish church of Gesseling, and that John Walter, Parson thereof, sing in the said church during his life, and pray for his soul, and all his friends souls; and to have yearly 4s. 4d. and meat and drink at his Manor place of Gesseling. He mentions Elizabeth his wife, Ellen and Anne his daughters, and entails his land in Kent and Sussex on Thomas his son, and in default of issue on William Ashburnham of Ashburnham, Esq. son of John Ashburnham, his brother.</P>
<P>Which John (eldest brother to the said Thomas and Richard Ashburnham) had to wife Alizabeth, daughter of — Peckham, and died in 1491, 7 Henry VII. as the probate of his last will shews. He orders his body to be buried in the chapel of St. James of Ashburnham, and left issue William Ashburnham, Esq. which William married Anne, daughter of Henry Hawley, of Ore, in Sussex, and had issue, a daughter Anne, first married to William Apsley, and secondly to Richard Covert of Slaugham, Esq. The said William had also John Ashburnham, Esq. his son and heir, who married Lora, daughter and co-heir of Thomas Berkely of Aram, in the county of Southampton, Esq. by whom he had issue three daughters;

This John had also a son of his own name, who served in parliament for Sussex, 1 and 2 of Philip and Mary, and marrying Isabel daughter of John Sackville, Esq. ancestor to his Grace the Duke of Dorset, had by her (who after his death married Edward Tyrrel, Esq.) three sons, John, Thomas, and William; and as many daughters; Eleanor; Anne, married to Tho∣mas Penderton of Suffolk; and Margaret, wife of — Jones of the county of Mon∣mouth, Esq.</P>
<P>The said John, the eldest son of John Ashburnham and Isabel Sackville, writing himself of Ashburnham, Esq. makes his will, April 10th, 1563, and died soon after; for the probate bears date May 18th following. He bequeaths to Isabel his wife all such goods, plate, &amp;c. remaining in his Lodge at Ashburnham, or at London, with
<PB N="142" REF="172"/>all her apparel, jewels, &amp;c. as also 200l. on condition she discharges her son, John Ashburnham of 100l. owing to Sir Richard Sackvil, which he had of John Sackvil, of Withiam, Esq. her father; he wills his Manors of Ashburnham, Pemborne, and Wilsham, with such other lands as Ninion Burrel holds by Knights service, to be di∣vided in three parts, one whereof to the use of the Lords of the fee, till John Ash∣burnham, his son and heir comes to the age of twenty-one years; and the other two parts, with all his other lands, &amp;c. in England, and the residue of his goods, plate, money, &amp;c. to his said son, whom with Isabel his wife, he constitutes his executors.</P>
<P>The said John Ashburnham, Esq. married Mary, daughter to George Fane, of Badsley, in the county of Kent, Esq. grandfather of Francis, first Earl of Westmor∣land, by whom he had five sons, John, his son and heir, Thomas, William, George, and Walter; which four last died without issue; and had also two daughters; Mary, wife of George Wentworth, of West-bretton, in com' Ebor. from whence in a lineal descent, was Sir William Wentworth, of Bretton, Baronet; and Catharine, married to George Aldwick, of Yorkshire, Esq.

<P>Of John, the eldest son, hereafter.</P>
<P>William Ashburnham, the second son, served in his youth in the service of the States-General against the Spaniards in the Netherlands; and being an excellent sol∣dier, had a principal command in that army raised by King Charles, to march against the Scots. He was member in the two parliaments summoned in 1640, and in the latter was examined on oath, whether he knew any thing of that plot charged on the officers of the army, for petitioning the King, &amp;c. which he denied; nerver∣theless, the parliament voted, that he should receive no pay. Standing thus in great umbrage with the parliament, (by whom he was in the sequel expelled with other loyal members) and the King's affairs not yet permitting him to make use of his ser∣vice, he, to avoid the clamour that was raised against him, embarked on board a small fly-boat for Holland, with some other officers, who removed on the same account. They had not been long at sea, before they met with one of his Majesty's ships, bring∣ing ammunition to his assistance; on which it was agreed, that Mr. Ashburnham and the Lord Digby should proceed on their voyage, and the others should return with the ammunition; but whilst this was agitating the parliament squadron came up, and though the ship escaped, yet the fly-boat was taken, and carried into Hull; where he was taken with the Lord Digby, who concealed himself under the disguise of a Frenchman, till he sound a convenient opportunity to reveal himself to the Go∣vernor, Sir John Hotham, whom he prevailed with to espouse his Majesty's interest,
<PB N="144" REF="174"/>and to surrender Hull; which design being at length rendered fruitless, Colonel Ashburnham, and the Lord Digby, were dismissed by the Governor, and was the principal cause (as Lord Clarendon writes) of the loss of Sir John's head.</P>
<P>Mr. Ashburnham came to his Majesty, about the time he set up his standard at Nottingham (which was on August 22d, 1642) and entered on action with the first, repairing to the Marquis of Hertford at Sherburn, where with a small force, having kept that castle several weeks without being incommoded by the Earl of Bedford, who watched them with a much greater army, they marched from thence to Minehead, and there the Marquis, with some other gentlemen, transported themselve into Wales, leaving this Colonel Ashburnham, with Sir Ralph Hopton and others to march into Cornwal. There they raised forces with such activity, that in a small time they made themselves masters of the West; and having performed very consider∣able services, joined Prince Maurine at Chard in Somersetshire, about the middle of June 1643, with an army of 3000 foot, 500 horse, and 300 dragoons, of which Colonel Ashburnham had been Major-General.</P>
<P>He was soon after made Governor of Weymouth on the opinion of his courage and dexterity; (as the Earl of Clarendon writes) and to make way for him, Sir An∣thony-Ashley Cooper was removed from that command. He was made Colonel-General of the county of Dorset, and in the year 1644, having received express or∣ders from Prince Maurice, to quit all places that he conceived not tenable in case an army should advance into those parts; he, about June 14th, on the Earl of Essex's marching towards him, quitted Weymouth, and retired to Portland Castle, where he endured a siege of about four months, with great patience and resolution, suffering both by the want of men and provisions, until he was relieved by the Earl of Cleve∣land, and Sir Walter Hastings appointed Governor in his room. However, being censured for quiting of Weymouth, he, at his own request, had a public hearing be∣fore his Majesty and the council, to whom he so fully stated the matter of fact (as Sir Edward Walker writes in his history of the progress of the King's forces) and the impossibility of keeping that place, in case an army did attempt it, together with his reasons for retiring to Portland, and how he disposed of his Majesty's arms and am∣munition, as that in the opinion of all there, he was cleared from any crime or neglect.</P>
<P>After the restoration he was made Cofferer to Charles II. and dying without issue in December, 1679, was buried in the church of Ashburnham in Sussex, where a
<PB N="145" REF="175"/>noble monument of white marble is erected to his memory, with his effigy in a Roman dress, and the effigy of his lady, in white marble, reposing her right arm on a cushion, an angel holding a wreath on her head: And in a compartment of white marble is this inscription:</P>
<P>"Under this Tomb (viz. in the vault for this family) lie the bodies of Jane Countess of Marlborough, and William Ashburnham her husband, second son of Sir John Ashburnham. She was daughter to John Lord Butler of Hertfordshire; she was married first to James Earl of Marlborough, Lord High Treasurer of England, who after seven years died and left her a young, beauti∣ful, and rich widow. When this William coming from beyond sea, where he was bred a soldier, married her, and after lived almost five and forty years most happily with her. She was a very great lover, and (through God's mercy) a great blessing to this family, which is hoped will ever remember it with honouring her memory. This William Ashburnham her husband, lived after her to a great age, and gloried in nothing in this world, but this his wife, and the almost unparalleled love and entire friendship, that for above 50 years was between his dear elder brother John Ashburnham, and himself. He was Cofferer to King Charles the First, and King Charles the Second: He died without issue, and by God's blessing, was a happy preserver of his brother's posterity.</P>
<P>The praise and glory of it be to God alone."</P>
<P>John Ashburnham (eldest son and heir of Sir John, and brother to William Ashburnham last mentioned) was one of the Grooms of the Bed-chamber to Charles I. and in 1640, was elected to parliament for the port of Hastings. He attended on his Majesty during the rebellion, and his behaviour was so satisfactory, that the King had an entire confidence in him, and was pleased to nominate him, in 1644, one of his Commissioners for the Treaty at Uxbridge. Also, in 1645, the King desired of the parliament that a safe conduct might be granted to the Duke of Richmond, the Earl of Southampton, Mr. John Ashburnham, and Mr. Jeffery Palmer, to come to Westminster, with his propositions for peace. And he was also one with others appointed by his Majesty to commit the militia, for such time, and with such power, as expressed by his Commissioners at Uxbridge.</P>
<P>On April 27th, 1646, when his Majesty thought proper to leave Oxford, Mr. Ash∣burnham
<PB N="146" REF="176"/>was the only servant that attended him, and indeed, the only person, ex∣cepted a clergyman, Dr Hudson, who served as a guide. Afterwards, when the King was in the hands of the Scots army, he transported himself to France, with his Majes∣ty's approbation, the Scots threatening to deliver him to the parliament; and had forbid him his Majesty's presence. But when he heard the King was in the hands of the English army, and that there was not the same restraint as formerly, he resolved to make an adventure to wait on him; and having, by some friends, a recommendation both to Cromwell and Ireton (who knew the credit he had with the King, and that his Majesty would be very well pleased to have his attendance, and look on it as a testimony of their respect to him) he was left at liberty to repair to the King, and was very welcome to his Majesty. He, and Sir John Berkeley, who came from France at the same time, were the two principal agents for conferring both with his Majesty's friends, and with the officers of the army, as often as they desired. But the army having got the sole power, and subdued all opposition from the parliament, as well as the city, they began not only to be less regardful of these his Majesty's agents, but even of the King himself; who therefore resolved to make his escape. Mr. Ashburham was chiefly confided in; and he and Sir John Berkeley having passes sent them to go beyond the seas, contrived means for his Majesty's escape from Hampton-Court, which was effected on November 11th, 1647: and having con∣ducted the King to the sea-coast, they were sent to treat with Colonel Hammond, Governor of the Isle of Wight, to take the King into his protection, which he seemed to comply with; but by a fatal mistake of this man's honour, that unhappy Prince was delivered into the hands of the army. This occasioned a suspicion of Mr. Ash∣burnham's, as well as Berkeley's fidelity; but it chiefly lay on the former, because, as Lord Clarendon writes, it was inferred he was known to have so great an influence on his Majesty's councils and resolutions, that he could not be ignorant of any thing that moved him.</P>
<P>Yet Lord Clarendon, who discourses largely of this affair, sufficiently clears Mr. Ashburnham from the imputation laid to his charge, saying, "That he preserved his reputation and credit with the most eminent of the King's party; and his remaining in England after the death of the King, which his enemies charged as an aggravation of suspicion against him, was upon the marriage of a lady, by whom he had a great fortune, and many conveniencies; which would have been seized by his leaving the
<PB N="147" REF="177"/>kingdom; and he did send over to King Charles II. and had leave to stay there, and sometimes supplied the King with considerable sums of money. Afterwards he was committed to the Tower by Cromwell, where he remained till his death; and the King was known, to the last, to have had a clear opinion of his affection and integri∣ty; and when King Charles II. returned, most of those of the greatest reputation, as the Marquis of Hertford, and the Earl of Southampton, gave him a good testimony.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, (says the same historian) it is probable that Cromwell, who, many years after committed him to the Tower, and did hate him, and desired to have taken his life, would have been glad to have blasted his reputation, by declaring, that he had carried his master to the Isle of Wight without his privity, merely upon his own presumption. Besides, he was a person of unblemished honour and vera∣city, and had not any temptation, and never gave any cause in the subsequent actions of his life to have his fidelity suspected."</P>
<P>In a manuscript I have seen, wrote by this Mr. Ashburnham, in his own vindi∣cation, he thus expresses himself: 'And though for no other motive, yet for this, that my own posterity may know I have not stupidly, through silence, passed by the heavy censures upon me, there shall be (for their information) this faithful discourse extant, to settle their judgments of my integrity to his Majesty, and prevent the irre∣verence which otherwise may perhaps not only be paid to them to my memory, but give them cause (taking loose reports for granted truths) to loath themselves, for be∣ing branches of so unworthy and wicked a stock.</P>
<P>'If men would but as well consider the painful and vexatious partimposed on me, during all the wars, as they look upon the privileges I enjoyed, by my near relation to his Majesty's service, they would find more cause to pity me for my labours, than to envy me for the honour or profit of my employments: for, from the time his Majesty went last from London, to the time he left Oxford to go to the Scots army, I will confidently affirm, I lived as painful, and as servile a life, as any (whoever he was) of the meanest degree. But I hope that an unhappy fate, which hath hitherto followed me, will at least leave me in this, so that I may not be understood to repine at the hardships of my duty. Had the travel of my body or mind, been much more beset with toils and difficulties, I should (with the same chearfulness) have waded through all, when in the least measure there had been question of pursuing his Majesty's interest. It is no part of my intentions to adventure upon the history of the unfor∣tunate
<PB N="148" REF="178"/>divisions between his Majesty and the two Houses of Parliament, my business being only to deliver so much as my duty was particularly concerned in, when his Majesty was pleased to remove from Oxford to the Scots army; and from Hampton Court to the Isle of Wight; and not to trouble myself or others with more than what is pertinent to the suppressing those false and horrid aspersions cast upon my fidelity in both these actions, wherein I shall be careful that nothing shall fall from me, the truth whereof I will not be ready at all times to justify with my life.</P>
<P>'To wave therefore all things that passed between his Majesty, the two Houses of Parliament, and their armies, till the month of April, 1646, I hold it fit to give the state of things: that when his Majesty's forces were reduced to the last period (which I take to be the time that Oxford was besieged) it was judged necessary, by all considering men, that his sacred person should not be liable to the success of an assault (for con∣ditions or treaties seemed vain to be expected where the King was) but that some ex∣pedient should be found by escape from thence to save his life, though nothing could be thought on in order to his flight, that, in point of danger, kept not equal pace with the hazard of his stay. Notwithstanding it was then first debated (as the King was pleased to tell me) whether it were not better for his Majesty to stay than leave Ox∣ford, &amp;c.'</P>
<P>After the Restoration, he was restored to his former post of Groom of the Bed∣chamber, and was elected one of the Knights of the shire for Sussex, to that parlia∣ment which met at Westminster, anno 1661. He lies buried in the chancel of Ash∣burnham church, under a noble monument of black and white marble, whereon lies the effigies in full proportion of a gentleman in armour, between his two wives, the one in a winding-sheet and the other in a baroness's robe, with a coronet on her head; all their hands elevated; and underneath are the figures of four sons, and four daugh∣ters, kneeling before a desk. Over all, in an arch of white marble, supported by two black marble pillars, is the following inscription on black marble, in gilt Roman letters:</P>
<Q REND="inline normQuotes"><P>Here lies in the vault underneath, John Ashburnham, Esq. of this place, son to the unfortunate person Sir John Ashburnham, whose good nature and frank disposition towards his friends, in being deeply engaged for them, necessitated him to sell this place (in his family long before the conquest) and all the estate he had elsewhere, not leaving to his wife and six children the least substance;
<PB N="149" REF="179"/>which is not inserted to the least disadvantage of his memory (God forbid it should be understood to be a charge of disrespect upon him) but to give God the praise, who so suddenly provided both for his wife and children; as that within less than two years after the death of the said Sir John, there was not any of them but was in condition rather to be helpful to others, than to want support themselves. May God be pleased to add this blessing to his posterity, that they may never be unmindful of the great things he hath done for them. The wife of the said Sir John Ashburnham, was daughter to Sir Thomas Beaumont, of Staughton in the county of Leicester; she was very eminent for her great temper and prudence: She died in the seventy-fifth year of her age; and both the said Sir John, and his wife, lie buried in the church of St. Andrew's in Holborn, London.</P>
<P>The said Mr. John Ashburnham married the daughter and heir of William Holland of Westburton in this county, Esq. who lies also here interred, and by whom he had these eight children. She made the first step towards the re∣covery of some part of the inheritance wasted by the said Sir John, for she sold her whole estate to lay out the money in this place. She lived in great repu∣tation for piety and discretion, and died in the seven and thirtieth year of her age. The second wife to the said Mr. John Ashburnham, who lies also here interred, was the widow of the Lord Poulett of Hinton St. George in the county fo Somerset: She was daughter and heir to Christopher Kenn of Kenn in that county, Esq. who left her a great estate in lands, now in the possession of the Lord Poulett. She was worthy imitation by all her sex, for her honourable and religious conversation: she brought great advantages to the family of this place, and died at the age of seventy years and four months: and her memory is pre∣cious to all considering persons that knew her. This Mr. John Ashburnham was of the Bedchamber to their Majesties Charles I. and Charles II. who when he had performed the service to God in building this church at his own charge, died in the sixty-eighth year of his age, on the fifteenth day of June, in the year of our Lord 1671.</P></Q>
<P>Frances, the first wife of the said John Ashburnham, died in the year 1649, and was buried at Ashburnham. Of their daughters, Frances, born anno 1632, was married to Sir Denny Ashburnham, of Bromham in Sussex, Bart. from whom is
<PB N="150" REF="180"/>descended the present Sir William Ashburnham, Lord Bishop of Chichester; and Elizabeth, to Sir Hugh Smith, of Long-Ashton in the county of Somerset, Baronet. The eldest son, William Ashburnham, Esq. died in the year 1655, and was buried at Ashburnham, having married Elizabeth, daughter of John Lord Poulett, of Hin∣ton St. George, by whom he had issue John his son and heir, created Lord Ash∣burnham. And the said Elizabeth was secondly married to Sir William Hartop, of Rotherby in the county of Leicester, and dying on August 18, 1690, aged 60, was buried at Ashburnham.</P>
<P>JOHN, FIRST LORD ASHBURNHAM, was heir to his grandfather, as also to his uncle William Ashburnham: and on the accession of King William and Queen Mary, was created a Baron, by the style and title of Lord Ashburnham, Baron of Ashburnham, in Sussex, by letters-patent dated May 20th, 1698, in the first year of their reign. His Lordship married, in Westminster-Abbey, July 22d, 1677, Brid∣get, only daughters and heir to Walter Vaugham, of Porthommal-house in Brecknock∣shire, Esq. and on August 19th, 1702, his Lordship was constituted Custos Rotulo∣rum of that county. He departed this life at his house in Southampton-street, near Bloomsbury square, on January 22d, 1709-10, aged fifty-four years and seven days, and was buried at Ashburnham. He left issue three sons; William, who succeeded him in honour and estate; John, late Lord Ashburnham, and Bertram: also two daughters: Elizabeth, married first to Robert Cholmondley, of Holford in Cheshire, and secondly, to Seymour Cholmondley, Esq. and died on January 26th, 1731-2; Jane, youngest daughter, wedded to James Hays, Esq. and died in Au∣gust, 1731.</P>
<P>WILLIAM, SECOND LORD ASHBURNHAM, married Catharine, daugh∣ter, and at length sole heir to Thomas Taylor, of Clapham in the county of Bedford, Esq. but died, leaving no issue by her, on June 16th, 1710, aged thirty-five years; and she on July 11th, the same year, aged twenty-three years, and were both buried at Ashburnham. To whom succeeded John, his next brother and heir.</P>
<P>JOHN, FIRST EARL OF ASHBURNHAM, was by Queen Anne, constituted Colonel and Captain of the first troop of horse guards; and in December, 1728, ap∣pointed Gentleman of the Bed-chamber to Frederick, Prince of Wales, but resigned that office in June 1731; having the year before, on May 14th, 1730, 3 George II. in con∣sideration of his great merits, been created Viscount St. Asaph in the Principality
<PB N="151" REF="181"/>of Wales, and Earl Ashburnham. And on November 23d, 1731, was constituted Captain of the yeomen of the guard.</P>
<P>His Lordship married to his first wife, on October 21st, 1710, the Lady Mary Butler, daughter to James Duke of Ormond, who dying without issue on January 2d, 1712, in the 23d year of her age, was buried at Ashburnham. He married secondly on July 24th, 1714, Henrietta Countess of Anglesey, widow of John, Earl of Anglesey, and daughter to William, Earl of Derby, who died on June 26th, 1718, in the 31st year of her age, leaving an only daughter, the Lady Henrietta Ash∣burnham, who died unmarried August 8th, 1732. He married, to his third wife, the Lady Jemima Grey, daughter to Henry, Duke of Kent; which Lady died on July 7th, 1731, leaving issue one son John, born October 30th, 1724. John, Earl of Ashburnham departing this life at his house in St. James's-square, in the 49th year of his age, on March 10th, 1736-7, was buried at Ashburnham. And was succeeded by his only son, and heir,</P>
<P>JOHN, SECOND EARL ASHBURNHAM, who was one of the Lords of the Bed-chamber to his late Majesty; and July 14th, 1753, was appointed Keeper of his Majesty's Park, called Hyde-park, in the county of Middlesex; and also Keeper of St. James's Park.

BRUCE, EARL OF AILESBURY.</HEAD>
<P>THE family of Bruce is of the same lineage as the kings of Scotland, being de∣scended from Robert le Brus (or Bruis) a noble knight of Normandy, who was a person of such note and valour, and so much confided in by William Duke of Normandy, that after his victory obtained on October 14th, 1066, over Harold King of England, he sent him to subdue the northern parts of that realm: which having successfully performed, he was rewarded with no less than forty-three lord∣ships in the East and West-Ridings of Yorkshire, and fifty-one in the North-Riding of that county; where the manor and castle of Skelton was the capital of his barony. He likewise obtained by conquest, and other ways, Hert and Hertness in the bishoprick of Durham. This Robert died about the year 1100, according to some writers, but according to others, about the year 1094; and left issue, a son and successor,</P>
<P>ROBERT DE BRUIS, SECOND LORD OF SKELTON, a man of great worth and honour, who contracted a great friendship with David I. King of Scotland, while that monarch remained in England; where he was styled Earl and Prince of Cumberland, during the reign of Alexander I. his brother and predecessor, and was also Earl of Northumberland, Huntingdon, and Northampton, in right of his con∣sort, Mathilda, or Maud, daughter of the renowned Earl Waltheof. This Robert de Bruis accompanied King David into Scotland, and was accounted one of his no∣bles and subjects, as is evident from the register of he bishoprick of Glasgow, where it is recited, that David, by writ between the years 1120 and 1124, gave <HI>centum soli∣dorum
<PB N="154" REF="184"/>in</HI> Hardingestra (in Northamptonshire) for repairing the church of Glasgow, with the consent of Mathilda his wife, <HI>et procerum et militum meorum, Roberti de Brus,</HI> &amp;c. It is equally evident, from sundry documents, that the same Robert was pos∣sessed on the lordship of Annandale, which contained all the lands, from the bounds of Dunnegal and Strathnith, to the lands of Ranulph de Meschines, then Earl of Chester and Lord of Cumberland; and it is affirmed by some historians, that by the mediation of King David, he obtained them in marriage with Agnes Annand, heir∣ess of that vast estate, of which he got confirmation from that monarch, and thereby had large possessions in both kingdoms. As he was a man of great parts, and equally qualified for the cabinet and the field, he was in high favour with Henry I. King of England, as well as with the said David, King of Scotland. Being at the court of England, A. D. 1137, King Stephen joined him in commission with Ber∣nard de Baliol, to endeavour to dissuade or divert King David from his intended in∣vasion of England, and Robert used all his interest with the Scottish monarch; but to no purpose, for that prince, neglecting the advice, pursued his former resolutions, and entered England with a considerable army. Upon that, Robert withdrew his allegiance from David, and was on the English side at the famous battle of the Stan∣dard, which proved fatal to the Scots, and was fought in 1138, near Northalverton, or Northallerton, in Yorkshire. In this action Robert de Brus took prisoner his own son Robert, who had been left in Scotland, and was then about 14 years of age. When the father presented him to King Stephen, his majesty desired that he might be delivered to his nurse to be taken care of: an Sir William Dugdale says, he was more fit to be eating wheat-bread with his mother, than by force of arms to be defend∣ing his patrimony of Annandale, &amp;c. However, peace being concluded next year between the two kingdoms, in consequence of which Northumberland was given to Henry, Prince of Scotland, Robert continued in favour and friendship with King David ever after.</P>
<P>This Robert was very eminent for his piety and devotion, having, in 1129, 29 Henry I. (as appears by Sir William Dugdale's Monasticon) founded a monastery for canons regular of St. Augustine, at Gysburn, or Gisburne (commonly called Gisborough) in Cleveland, Agnes his wife, and Adam his son and heir, joining with him therein, amply endowing it with 20 carucates of land, each carucate then con∣taining 60 acres. This monastery was the common burial-place of the nobility and
<PB N="155" REF="185"/>persons of rank in those parts; and its church, by the ruins, seems to have been equal to the best cathedrals in England. He also bestowed upon the same monastery the patronage of all the churches within his lordship of Annandale, viz. the churches of Annand, Lochmaben, Kirkpatrick, Cumbertrees, Renpatrick, Drivesdale, Hod∣ham, Castlemilk, Grentenhou, with all the appurtenances of each and singular of those churches. He also gave the church of Middlesburgh, with two carucates, and two bovates of land in Nehuham, to the monks of Whitby in Yorkshire, on condi∣tion that they should place certain of their convent there; with which they complied, and made it a cell to their abbey; he likewise gave to the abbey of St. Mary's, at York, his lordships of Appilton, and Hornby, with all the lands lying betwixt the same and the great road leading from York to Durham, being part of his lordship of Mid∣dleton. He also gave them two carucates of land, and a mill in Sunderland-Wick, as also the town of Karkarevill, which by the monks of that house were assigned to their cell at Wederhal in Cumberland. According to Sir William Dugdale, he departed this life, 5 Id. Maii, (i.e. May 11th) 1141, and was buried in the said abbey of Gisburne; but according to Sir James Dalrymple, in the year 1143. However, he had two wives, 1st, Agnes, and English lady, daughter of Fulco Paynell, with whom he had the manor of Carleton; and, 2d, Agnes Annand, who brought him the lordship of Annandale, as before-mentioned. By the first he was father of a son, Adam, his successor in most of the English estates; and by his 2d lady he had two sons, William, of whom afterwards, as continuator of the male line of this illus∣trious family, and Robert, taken prisoner, as before recited, but of whose posterity there is no certain evidence. He is likewise said to have had a daughter, Agatha, wife of Ralph (son of Ribald, Lord of Middleham in Yorkshire) who had with her in frank-marriage the lordship of Ailewick in Hertness, in the palatinate of Durham.</P>
<P>His eldest son ADAM, THIRD LORD OF SKELTON, behaved with great valour in the aforesaid battle near Northalverton, against the King of Scotland. Ac∣cording to the piety of those times, he founded the priory of Hoton in Yorkshire; and he and Ivetta, his wife, dedicated the church of Thorp to the cathedral of York. He was also a benefactor to other religious houses; and departing this life on March 20th, 1162, 8 Henry II. had sepulture with his father at Gisburne. He was suc∣ceeded by his son, another</P>
<P>ADAM, FOURTH LORD OF SKELTON, who dying in July, 1185, left issue,
<PB N="156" REF="186"/>a son, Peter, his successor, and a daughter, Isabel, wedded to Henry de Percy (an∣cestor to the Earls of Northumberland) with whom he had, in marriage, by gift of the said Peter her brother, the manor of Leckenfield (near Beverley in Yorkshire) for which, he and his heirs were to repair to Skelton-castle, every Christmas-day, and lead the lady of the castle from her chamber to the chapel to say mass, and thence to her chamber again; and, after dining with her, to depart. The said Adam was succeeded by his aforesaid son,</P>
<P>PETER DE BRUS, FIFTH LORD OF SKELTON, who in 10 Richard I. paid 500 marks for his father's lands, and departing this life, on January 27th, 1211, 12 John, was interred at Gisburne, leaving another</P>
<P>PETER, SIXTH LORD OF SKELTON, who in 17 John, was in arms against the king, with other barons, who were offended at his having resigned his crown to Pope Innocent III. and consenting to hold it as a vassal to the see of Rome; and was so powerful, that he brought the whole country to submit to him. He paid, in 38 Henry III. for sixteen knights'-fees, and had other large possessions. Having made a voyage to the Holy Land, he died in his return on September 13th, 1267, 51 Henry III. at Marseilles, whence his corpse was brought to England, and buried at Gisburne. By Helewise, his wife, eldest sister and one of the coheirs of William de Lancaster, Baron of Kendal, he left four daughters, of whom afterwards, and an only son and successor,</P>
<P>PETER, SEVENTH LORD OF SKELTON, who departed this life about the year 1300, without issue by Helena de Mildain, his wife, and left his great estate to be divided among his four sisters, his coheirs. Of these, Agnes, the eldest, was the wife of Walter de Fauconberg, who had for her share the castle and barony of Skelton, with several manors; Lucia, the second, was married to Marmaduke, Baron Thweng, who had other large possessions, whose lineal heirs are, the present Earl of Scarborough, and Sir Charles Hotham, Baronet. Margaret, the third, wedded Robert de Ross, Lord of the castle of Warke, who in her right had the barony of Kendal; whose son William was Lord Ross of Kendal: and Laderina, the youngest, was married to Sir John de Bellew, and had for her share the lordship of Carleton, and divers other manors.</P>
<P>This branch therefore becoming extinct in the male line, as before recited, we now return to William, eldest son of Robert de Bruis, second Lord of Skelton, and first
<PB N="157" REF="187"/>Lord of Annandale, by his second wife, Agnes Annand, before-mentioned, who, in right of his mother, succeeded to the lordship of Annandale in Scotland, about the year 1141, or 1143, and to the lands of Hert, Hertness, in the bishoprick of Durham by the gift of his father, to be held of him and his successors, Lords of Skelton. He obtained from Henry II. King of England, the privilege of a weekly market, on Wednesdays, at his manor of Hartlepool: and gave to the canons of Gisburne certain lands, lying southward of the chapel of St. Hilda, at the said manor towards the sea. He confirmed the donations of the churches in Annandale, which his father had made to the monks of Gisburne. To shew that he looked upon his chief settlement to be in Scotland, he quitted his father's armorial bearings <HI>(Argent, a lion rampant, Gules)</HI> and assumed the coat of Annandale, viz. <HI>Or, a Saltire and Chief, Gules.</HI> In a char∣ter of some lands in Annandale to Adamo de Carleolo (one of his vassals) he is styled <HI>Willielmus de Bruce, Dominus vallis Annandiae, &amp;c.</HI> The charter is without date, but, by the names of the witnesses, must have been granted between the years 1170 and 1180. This William de Bruce died before the year 1183, and was succeeded by his son,</P>
<P>ROBERT, THIRD LORD OF ANNANDALE, a nobleman of great valour and magnanimity, and at the same time both pious and religious. He ratified and confirmed to the monastery of Gisburne all the grants of his predecessors, in these words: <HI>Sciatis me confirmasse Deo et ecclesiae Sanctae Mariae de Gisburn donationes illas quas fecit Robertus de Brus, avus meus, et quas idem confirmavit Willielmus de Brus pater meus, de ecclesia de Annand, de ecclesia de Lochmaben, &amp;c. &amp;c.</HI> William, (surnamed the Lion) King of Scotland, whose reign of about 49 years ended A. D. 1214, confirmed the above ratification, <HI>testibus Johanne de Huntingdon officiali Glasguensi, Henrico filio comitis David, Adam de Carleolo, Adam filio Herberti,</HI> besides divers others. About the year 1190, he entered into an agreement with Joceline, bishop of Glasgow, with con∣sent of the abbot and convent of Gisburne, whereby the before-mentioned churches in Annandale, which Robert, second Lord of Skelton and first Lord of Annandale had granted to the said convent, were made over to the see of Glasgow; his son con∣senting thereto, according to these words in the indenture: <HI>teste et concedente Roberto de Bruise filio Roberto de Bruise, &amp;c.</HI> He married Isabel, natural daughter of the said King William, by a daughter of Robert de Avenel, Lord of Liddisdale: and by the said lady (who secondly wedded Robert de Ross, Lord of Warke and
<PB N="158" REF="188"/>Hamlake in England, one of whose descendants in her right, notwithstanding her illegitimacy, put in his claim at the after-mentioned competition for the Scottish crown, and from whom the Rosses of Hamlake and Warke are descended) he left, at his death, A. D. 1191, an only son and heir,</P>
<P>ROBERT DE BRUISE, surnamed the Noble, FOURTH LORD OF AN∣NANDALE, who married Isabel, second daughter of Prince David, Earl of Hun∣tingdon and Chester, who was son of Henry, Prince of Scotland, eldest son of Da∣vid, King of Scotland, and younger brother to Malcolm IV. and William (the Lion) successively monarchs of that realm, the latter being father of King Alexan∣der II. whose son, Alexander III. dying without issue male, on March 17th, A. D. 1285, the undoubted right of succession to the Scottish sovereignty devolved upon his grand-daughter, Margaret, commonly called the Maid of Norway, she be∣ing daughter to Eric II. monarch of that realm, by his consort Margaret, daughter to the last mentioned Alexander. By this royal match the Lords of Annandale came to be amongst the greatest subjects in Europe: for by the said Isabel (who was one of three sisters, and coheiresses of John, surnamed Scot, Earl of Huntingdon, and last Count Palatine of Chester, of which palatinate he John became possessed in right of his mother Maud, the aforesaid Prince David's wife, daughter of Hugh Kiviliock, and eldest sister of Ranulph Blundeville, Earls Palatines of Chester) Robert, exclu∣sive of his paternal estate in both kingdoms, came to be possessed of the manor of Writtle and Hatfield, in Essex, together with half the hundred of Hatfield, which King Henry III. in the 25th year of his reign gave in exchange for those lands which descended to his lady by the death of her brother, John Earl Palatine of Chester: and she likewise brought him the castle of Kildrummie, and the lordship of Garioch, in Aberdeenshire, and the manors of Connington in Huntingdonshire, and Exton in Rutlandshire, which three she inherited from her father. This great peer died in an advanced age, A. D. 1245, and had sepulture with his ancestors, under a stately monument at Gisburne, leaving by the said Isabel, a son and successor.</P>
<P>ROBERT DE BRUS, FIFTH LORD OF ANNANDALE, who was one of the Justices of the Common Pleas in 1250, 34 Henry III. and in 36 Henry III. doing his homage, had livery of the lands of his mother's inheritance. In 38 Henry III. as one of the co-heirs to John Scot, Earl of Huntingdon, on assessment of the aid for making the king's eldest son knight, he paid twenty pound for ten knights' fees, which he had
<PB N="159" REF="189"/>of the honour of Peverell, of London, in the counties of Essex and Hertford. In 39 Henry III. he was constituted Sheriff of Cumberland, and Governor of the castle of Carlisle. In 48 Henry III. when many of the Barons put themselves in arms on pretence of asserting the laws of the land, and the people's liberties, he was one of those who stood firm to the king, and marched with him from Oxford to Northampton, where the rebellious Barons then were, with a great power; and on the assault of that town took several prisoners. But soon after, on May 14th, 1264, when the Barons (through the help of the Londoners) gave battle to the King at Lewes in Sussex, where they prevailed, he was (together with the King himself, and divers other great lords) taken prisoner; having, at that time (together with John Cumming) the command of those Scottish auxiliaries which were then there in King Henry's service. But the King obtaining his right by the victory at Evesham, on August 5th, 1265, the 49th of his reign; he was in 51 Henry III. again made Governor of the castle of Carlisle.</P>
<P>In 1290, 18 Edward I. after the death of Margaret, Queen of Scotland, daughter of Eric II. King of Norway, and grand-daughter and undoubted heir to Alexander III. before mentioned, he was one of the competitors for the Scottish crown with John Baliol, the other claimants suits being set aside, when the right of succession was declared to be betwixt these two candidates. It was alledged, among other arguments, for Robert Bruce, that it was customary in Scotland, for the brother of the last king to be preferred to his son, and adduced an example of Donald V.'s succeeding to the throne, A. D. 854, in preference to King Constantine II. the son of his elder brother King Kenneth II. commonly called Mac Alpin: that King Alexander II. who died in 1249, esteemed Robert as his heir, in failure of the descendants of his own body, even to the knowledge of Dornagild (or Derveguld) his (Robert's) mother's eldest sister, and John Baliol's mother, who was then alive, and assented to it, at least did not contradict it, having no male issue of her own: that it was a con∣stant maxim in Scotland, for the son of the second daughter to be preferred to the heir female of the eldest daughter: and that King Alexander III. acknowledged this Robert to be next heir to the crown, failing heirs of his own body; all which was offered to be proved by living witnesses. It was urged for John Baliol, that he stood one degree nearer in consanguinity to David Earl of Huntingdon, his grandmother, Margaret, being eldest daughter of that Prince; and that consequently the crown be∣longed
<PB N="160" REF="190"/>to him. On that principle (though the learned Mr. Thomas Ruddiman has clearly proved the right of representation, according to the then rules of succession, to have been in Bruce) the forty chosen peers, twenty of Scotland, and as many of England, did, at the tenth congress, in the castle of Berwick, on November 17th, 1292, declare John Baliol King of Scotland, by the direction of Edward I. King of England, who acted as umpire. After that decision, Robert Bruce, and John Hastings, Lord Bergavenny, who had been one of the competitors, in right of his grandmother, Ada, fourth and youngest daughter of the aforesaid David, Earl of Huntingdon, claimed each a third part of the kingdom, but were rejected. This Robert was so dissatisfied with the determination, that the could never be prevailed upon, either to give up his title, or to acknowledge King Edward superior, or John Baliol King of Scotland; and retired in great disgust to England, where, however, he did not long remain, but returned to his castle of Lochmaben. He died there in 1295, and was buried with his ancestors in the abbey of Gisburne.</P>
<P>He married Isabel, daughter of Gilbert de Clare, Earl of Gloucester; and by her had three sons,

<P>ROBERT BRUCE, the eldest son, AND SIXTH LORD OF ANNANDALE, attended Prince Edward (afterwards King Edward I.) into Palestine, where by his courage and conduct he acquired great honour. Upon his return from that expedition, he retired into England, where he had a considerable estate. In 1295, 23 Edward I.
<PB N="161" REF="191"/>he was made Governor of the castle of Carlisle, and in that and the two succeeding years had summons to parliament among the English Barons. In the last of those years, being called Robert de Bruce, senior (in regard to his eldest son, Robert, of whom afterwards) King Edward acknowledging his constant fidelity, ordered him to be put in possession of his lands in Scotland. He would never acknowledge the title of John Baliol; but being cajoled into the interest of King Edward, with the hopes of at∣taining the Scottish crown by that monarch's assistance, he contributed, together with his son aforesaid, to the English obtaining the victory at Dunbar, A. D. 1296; after which, putting Edward in mind of his promise, he received such an answer as convinced him how little he had to expect from that quarter. Nevertheless, being constrained to accompany King Edward in his future operations, he and his said son were with him at the battle of Falkirk, on July 22d, 1298, when the Scots were also defeated. After that action, he is said to have had an interview with the re∣nowned Sir William Wallace, one of the Scottish commanders, and to have been so much affected with the discourse of that great man, that he resolved to assert his own right, and rescue his country; but he never had a proper opportunity.</P>
<P>He married Margaret, Countess of Carrick, daughter and sole heir of Neil, Earl of Carrick, and widow of Adam de Kilconath, who in her right was Earl of Carrick, and having accompanied this Robert to the Holy Land, died there, without issue in 1272: and by her (in whose right he also became Earl of Carrick) had five sons,

Robert, their father, died in 1303, and was suc∣ceeded by his eldest son,</P>
<P>ROBERT, EARL OF CARRICK, AND SEVENTH LORD OF ANNAN∣DALE, who though obliged to temporize, and adhere to King Edward, as he had a considerable estate in England, yet he never lost view of his right to the Scottish monarchy. When he judged the time favourable for his purpose, he communicated his intention to some of his professed friends: and as John Cumming, Lord of Bade∣noch, was (though sister's son to John Baliol) among the number, and one of the most powerful men in Scotland, Robert, in order to secure him effectually to his in∣terest, agreed to make over to him all his paternal inheritance in that kingdom, pro∣vided he would assist him to ascend the throne. Cumming readily embraced the offer, as, in case of a revolution in favour of Bruce, he would have been in a situation little inferior to royal: but at last, doubting the success of the enterprize, or actuated by the hopes of an ample reward, or perhaps of obtaining the crown for himself (John Baliol having been dethroned by King Edward about nine years before, and then living in exile) he disclosed the whole transaction to the King of England. Robert Bruce was then at London, and had such early notice of his being betrayed, that
<PB N="163" REF="193"/>he made his escape to Scotland, though not without some hazard and difficulty. At his arrival there, his partizans were so enraged at Cumming's treachery, that some of them, on February 10th, 1306, put him to death in the church of Dumfries, whither, conscious of his guilt, he had fled for refuge: but neither the church, nor the altar, were allowed to be a sanctuary for such perfidy and treason. Robert having then collected a small body of men, proceeded to his palace of Scoon, where he was crowned on Palm-Sunday, March 27th, 1306. He had enjoyed his royalty but a short space, when he was attacked and defeated by an army sent against him by King Edward I. after which he experienced various turns of fortune, some of which seemed very unpropitious to his affairs. He was obliged to live in an obscure condition for a considerable time, during which his enemies tried every method their invention could suggest, either to captivate or destroy him: but being endowed with a large share of magnanimity and sagacity, and his partizans being likewise possessed of the same qualities, as well as an inviolable fidelity, all the schemes against him proved abortive. In a few years he became absolute master of Scotland, of which he not only secured quiet and respectable possession by the signal victory obtained at Ban∣nockburn, on June 24th, 1314, over a numerous army commanded by King Edward II. but was also enabled to carry the war with success into the territories of his adver∣sary. The Scottish historians, considering this monarch as the deliverer of his coun∣try from foreign subjection, and the restorer of its independency, characterize him as a prince qualified equally for the cabinet and field, and, exclusive of the many heroes produced by his family, sufficient not only to render it, but even a whole kingdom, illustrious. His Majesty was twice married, 1st, to Isabel, daughter of Donald, tenth Earl of Marr, and sister to the aforesaid Gratney, Earl of Marr; and 2dly, to Eliza∣beth, daughter to Henry de Burgh, Earl of Ulster in Ireland. By the first he had a daughter, Marjory, wedded to Walter, Lord High Steward of Scotland, who by her was father of a son, Robert Stewart, afterwards monarch of that kingdom, by the name of Robert II. and also of a daughter, Egidia, or Giles, married to Sir James Lind∣say of Crawford. King Robert, by his second consort, daughter to the Earl of Ul∣ster, had an only son, David, his successor, and likewise three daughters,

</LIST></P>
<P>King Robert departed this life on June 9th, 1329, and his only son, beforemen∣tioned, mounted the Scottish throne, by the name of DAVID II. who was then in the ninth year of his age, and lately espoused to Johanna, sister to King Edward III. of England. The tranquillity of his reign was soon disturbed by Edward, John Baliol's son, who landing in Scotland, A. D. 1332, accompanied by divers English noblemen, claiming lands in that kingdom, and being reinforced by the adherents of his family, routed the Bruceans, and got himself crowned king. This disaster, together with the discomfiture of the Scottish army next year, at Hallidon-hill, obliged the regents to send David and his queen to France. However, his partizans acted with such perseverance, that they expelled Edward Baliol, and David returned to Scotland on May 3d, 1342. After his re-establishment, he made several expedi∣tions into England, to make a diversion in favour of the French; but on October 17th, 1346, his army was routed, and himself wounded and taken prisoner, at Nevil's Cross, near Durham. Several treaties were set on foot for his liberty; but none took effect till 1357, when he was ransomed for 100,000 marks sterling. King David was twice married, 1st to the beforementioned Johanna, daughter of Edward II. King of England, and 2dly, to Jane, daughter, (some say widow) of Sir John Logie, of Logie: but having no issue by either at his death, on February 27th, 1370, the crown devolved to his nephew, Robert Stewart, before taken notice of, whose right, upon the decease of the said Edward Baliol, without heirs of his body, became un∣questionable, in the strictest sense of hereditary succession, and from him his present Majesty is descended.</P>
<P>Having thus deduced the principal male branch of this family, Lord Bruce's col∣lateral relations, we return to JOHN DE BRUIS, or BRUCE, third son of RO∣BERT, FIFTH LORD OF ANNANDALE, competitor for the crown of Scotland, his Lordship's immediate ancestor. Sir Robert, grandson of this John, is styled be∣loved and faithful cousin by King David II. (son of King Robert I. in a charter, dated December 9th , 1359, which he got from that monarch, of the castle and manor of Clackmannan, Gyrmanston, Garclew, Wester-Kennault, Pitsoluden, with divers other lands, all within the shire of Clackmannan. He likewise obtained a charter
<PB N="165" REF="195"/>dated October 20th, 1365 (37 David II.) of the lands of Gyrmanston, Kennet, and other possessions in the aforesaid county, contained in the preceding charter, to him and the lawful heirs male of his body. Sir Robert, moreover, on January 17th, 1369, (40 David II.) got a charter of the lands of Rait, in Perthshire, with the same limi∣tation as in the foregoing charter; being called, in both, the King's beloved cousin, a designation to which he was justly entitled, being the nearest relation, of the name of Bruce, to the royal family. This gentleman (from whom every person of the surname of Bruce is descended) bore the arms of the Lords of Annandale, his ancestors, viz. Or, a chief and saltire, Gules, with a star or mullet on the chief, to denote his descent, from a third son of that illustrious house: but his posterity, upon the extinction of the elder male branches, laid aside the star, and carried the arms simply, as undoubted chiefs of the whole name. Sir Robert married Dame Isabel Stewart, daughter of Sir Robert Stewart, ancestor of the Stewarts of Rosythe; and by her had five sons,

Sir Robert, by the same lady, was also father of a daughter, Helen, married to David Ross of Balnagowan, male representative of the ancient Earls of Ross; but that representation is now in Mr. Ross of Pitcalny.</P>
<P>SIR ROBERT BRUCE, the eldest son, succeeded his father before 1393: for on August 12th, that year (4 Robert III.) he got, upon his own resignation, a charter, dated at Linlithgow, of the lands of Rait aforesaid, to himself in life-rent, and in fee to the heirs male of his body; in failure of which, to his nearest heirs whatsoever. On October 24th, 1394 (5 Robert III.) he got a charter of the lands of Clackman∣nan, &amp;c. to himself in life-rent, and to the heirs male of his body in fee; which sail∣ing, to return to the king; and in both the said charters he is styled his majesty's beloved cousin. Sir Robert died in 1405, and having married a daughter of Sir John Scrymgeour of Dudhop, in the county of Angus, who enjoyed the hereditary offices of Standard-bearer of Scotland, and Constable of Dundee, had by her two sons,

This Sir Da∣vid was in great favour with King James IV. who conferred upon him the honour of Knighthood. He was twice married, 1st to Janet, daughter to Sir William Stir∣ling of Keir; and, 2dly, to Marian, daughter of Sir Robert Herries of Terreagles. By the first he had a son, Robert, who got the lands of Rait, and dying before his father, lest, by Elizabeth Lindsay, his wife, a son, David Bruce, who, on February 1st, 1506, (18th James IV.) signed a renunciation of his right to the estate of Clack∣mannan in favour of Sir David, son of Sir David his grandfather by the second marriage.

<P>SIR EDWARD BRUCE, OF KINLOSS, second son of Sir Edward Bruce of Blairhall, aforesaid, being a person of great learning and eminentabilities, was sent, in 1601, by King James VI. with the Earl of Marr to congratulate Queen Elizabeth, on her success in repressing the attempt of Robert Devereux, Earl of Essex, and then settled such a correspondence with Sir Robert Cecil, principal secretary of state, that he was eminently instrumental in the peaceable accession of King James to the crown of England. In recompense of those faithful services, he had, soon after his return to Scotland, a grant of the dissolved abbey of Kinloss, in the shire of Elgin; and by letters patent, dated at Holy-rood-house, February 22d, 1603 (36 James VI.) was created Lord Bruce, of Kinloss, with remainder to his heirs male for ever. That year, he accompanied his majesty into England, and on July 8th, 1604, was made Master of the Rolls during life. His Lordship was of the privy council to his majesty in both kingdoms, and dying in the 62d year of his age, on January 14th, 1610, was buried on the north side of the altar in the chapel of the Rolls in Chancery-lane, where a fair monument is erected to his memory, with his effigy at length, habited as Master of the Rolls, and this epitaph:

<P>EDWARD, SECOND LORD BRUCE, OF KINLOSS, his eldest son was made Knight of the Bath at the creation of Henry Prince of Wales, A. D. 1610, and af∣terwards one of the Gentlemen of the Bed-chamber to King James I. But in 1613, had the misfortune to fall into a fatal quarrel with Sir Edward Sackville (afterwards Earl of Dorset) of which will be given a full account, under the title of the Duke of Dorset: and being slain by him in a duel, Thomas his brother became his heir.</P>
<P>Which THOMAS, THIRD LORD BRUCE, OF KINLOSS, was in great favour with King Charles I. and having attended him at his coronation in Scotland, on June 18th, 1633, was by letters patent dated three days afterwards, at Holy-rood-house, created Earl of Elgin in that kingdom, with like remainder as the barony of Kinloss. He was also, on August 1st, 1641, the 17th year of the same reign, ad∣vanced to the degree of a Baron of England, by the title of Lord Bruce, of Worlton, in the county of York.</P>
<P>He married two wives; first, Anne, daughter to Sir Robert Chichester, of Raleigh, in com. Devon. Knight, by Anne his wife, one of the daughters and co-heirs of John
<PB N="169" REF="199"/>Lord Harrington; and secondly Diana, one of the daughters and co-heirs of William Lord Burleigh, son and heir to Thomas Earl of Exeter, and widow of Henry Vere, Earl of Oxford. By the last lady he had no issue; but by the first he left Robert his son and heir; and died on December 21st, 1663.</P>
<P>ROBERT, FIRST EARL OF AILESBURY, AND SECOND EARL OF ELGIN, was, with Thomas Wentworth, Earl of Cleveland, on July 26th, 1660, con∣stituted jointly or separately Lords Lieutenants of the county of Bedford; and having given proofs of his loyalty to King Charles I. in his troubles, and been instru∣mental in the happy restoration of his royal son, was on March 18th, 1663-4, 16 Charles II. created Baron Bruce, of Skelton, in the county of York, Viscount Bruce, of Ampthill, in the county of Bedford, and Earl of Ailesbury, in the county of Bucks. Moreover, on March 29th, 1667, he was constituted sole Lord Lieutenant of the county of Bedford on the death of the Earl of Cleveland, aforesaid, and the King, the same year, having promised both houses of parliament, that he would con∣stitute commissioners for taking the accounts of such monies as had been raised and assigned to his Majesty during the late war with the Dutch, his Lordship was one of the six Peers, who, with twelve of the House of Commons, were commissioned for that inquiry. On October 18th, 1678, he was sworn of the privy-council to his Majesty; and in the same reign was one of the Gentlemen of the royal Bedchamber; and in commission for executing the office of Earl-marshal of England, as deputy to Henry Duke of Norfolk.</P>
<P>On the accession of King James II. to the throne, he was one of the lords who, at the coronation, April 23d, 1685, bore part of the regalia, viz. St. Edward's staff; and on the death of the Earl of Arlington, on July 28th that year, he had two days after the white staff delivered to him by the King, as Lord Chamberlain of his House-hold: but on October 20th following, departed this life at his seat at Ampthill, and was there buried. Wood, in his Fasti Oxoniensis, vol. I. p. 887, gives him this cha∣racter: "He was a learned person, and otherwise well qualified; was well versed in English history and antiquities, a lover of all such as were professors of those studies, and a curious collector of manuscripts, especially of those which related to England, and English antiquities. Besides also, he was a lover of the regular clergy, as those of Bedfordshire and Bucks know well enough."</P>
<P>He married Diana, daughter to Henry Grey first Earl of Stamford, by whom he
<PB N="170" REF="200"/>had issue eight sons, Edward, Robert, Charles, Henry, and Bernard, who died young; Thomas, Robert, and James, who survived him; and nine daughters, of whom Lady Diana was married to Sir Seymour Shirley, of Stanton-Harold, in the county of Leicester, Baronet, and afterwards to John first Duke of Rutland; Lady Anne, to Sir William Rich, of Sunning, in the county of Berks, Baronet; Lady Christian, first to John Rolle, Esq. eldest son of Sir John Rolle, of Stevenstone, in the county of Devon, Knight of the Bath, and afterwards to Sir Robert Gayer of Stoke-Poges, in the county of Bucks, Knight of the Bath, and died on April 5, 1720; Lady Mary, to Sir William Walters of Sarsden, in the county of Oxon, Baronet; Lady Arabella died unmarried; Lady Anne-Charlotte married Nicholas Baganall, of Newry in the kingdom of Ireland, and Place-Neudd, in the Isle of Anglesey, Esq.; Lady Henrietta wedded Thomas Ogle, Esq. only son of Sir Thomas Ogle, Go∣vernor of Chelsea College; and Ladies Christiana and Elizabeth died young. This Earl was succeeded by his eldest surviving son,</P>
<P>THOMAS, SECOND EARL OF AILESBURY, AND THIRD EARL OF ELGIN. He married on August 31, 1676, Elizabeth, third and only surviving daughter of Henry Lord Beauchamp, son of William Marquis of Hertford, after∣wards second Duke of Somerset, and at the death of her brother, William, third Duke of Somerset, on September 26th, 1671, sole heir to Tottenham-park, and Sa∣vernake-forest, in Wiltshire, besides divers estates in that and other counties, now in the possession of the present Lord Bruce. The Earl of Ailesbury's issue by her, were four sons and two daughters. His eldest son, Robert Lord Bruce, born August 6th, 1697, died young; as did Thomas, third son, and Henry, the youngest. His se∣cond son, Charles Lord Bruce, was called up to the House of Peers, in the lifetime of his father, as will be hereafter shewn. Lady Elizabeth, eldest daughter, was married to George, third Earl of Cardigan; and Lady Mary, the youngest (of whom her mother died in childbed, on January 12th, 1696-7) deceased on April 2d, 1698.</P>
<P>Which Elizabeth Countess of Ailesbury had a warrant from King Charles II. June 28th, 1672, granting her the title of Lady, and the place and precedency of a daughter of the Duke of Somerset, notwithstanding her father, Henry Lord Beau∣champ died in the lifetime of her grandfather, William Duke of Somerset. She was the first descendant in blood from Mary, royal consort of Lewis XII. King of France, younger daughter to King Henry VII. being grand-child to William Duke of So∣merset,
<PB N="171" REF="201"/>who was grandson to Catherine Countess of Hertford, daughter, and at length sole heir to Henry Grey, Duke of Suffolk, by Lady Frances his wife, eldest daugh∣ter and co-heir to Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk, and Mary, the French queen, his wife, youngest daughter of Henry VII. as aforesaid; from whose eldest, Marga∣ret, married to James IV. King of Scotland, the present Royal Family is descended.</P>
<P>His Lordship was amongst those Peers who offered their service to King James on the Prince of Orange's embarking his troops for England: but on that king's withdrawing from Whitehall, on December 10th, 1688, in order to embark for France, the Lords spiritual and temporal, in and about Westminster, met at Guild-hall the next day, and sending for the Lord Mayor, drew up a declaration, which was signed by the Archbishops of Canterbury and York, the Earls of Pembroke, Dorset, and twenty-five other Peers; among which the Earl of Ailesbury was the seventeenth that subscribed to it, and agreed to the sending to the Prince of Orange. The declaration sets forth, "That his Majesty having withdrawn himself, in order to his departure out of the kingdom, by the pernicious counsels of persons ill affected to our nation and religion; we cannot, without being wanting to our duty, be silent under these calamities, wherein the Popish councils, which so long prevailed, have miserably involved these realms. We do therefore unanimously resolve to apply ourselves to his Highness the Prince of Orange, who, with so great kindness to these kingdoms, so vast expence, and so much hazard to his own person, hath under∣taken, by endeavouring to procure a free parliament, to rescue us, with as little effu∣sion as possible of Christian blood, from the imminent dangers of popery and slavery.</P>
<P>And we do hereby declare, the we will, with our utmost endeavours, assist his Highness in obtaining such a parliament with all speed, wherein our laws, our liberties and properties, may be secured, the church of England in particular, with a due liberty to protestant dissenters; and in general, the protestant religion and interest over the whole world, may be supported and encouraged, to the glory of God, the happiness of the established religion and interest in these kingdoms, &amp;c."</P>
<P>They further declared, that they would, as much as in them lay, preserve the peace of London and Westminster; and would disarm all Papists, and secure all Jesuits and Romish priests, who were in and about the same: and if there were any thing more to be performed by them, for promoting his Highness's generous inten∣tions for the public good, they should be ready to do it, as occasion should require.</P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="202"/>The Earl of Ailesbury acquiesced in those measures, as they were apparently the only means of reconciling the King and people, and were entirely consonant to the Prince of Orange's declaration, wherein he made not the least insinuation of a view to the crown. When the King was stopt at Feversham, on December 14th, from going over to France, on the new thereof, the Peers and privy-council met, and, after some debates, they appointed this Earl of Ailesbury, William Paston, Earl of Yar∣mouth, Lewis Duras, Earl of Feversham, and Charles Middleton, Earl of Middle∣ton, to wait on his Majesty, to invite his return to his palace at Whitehall; to which he shewed some reluctance, yet at last condescended to their request. Afterwards, when the Prince's orders were communicated by three Peers, about one in the morn∣ing of December 18th, to the King, then in bed, for his Majesty to quit his place of Whitehall, the Earl of Ailesbury, with Edward-Henry Lee, Earl of Litchfield, James, Earl of Arran (afterwards Duke of Hamilton), and George Douglas, Earl of Dunbarton, went with the King in his barge, who had 100 of the Prince's Dutch forces to guard him to Rochester. The same day, the Prince came to St. James's, and the King determining on going to France, about three in the morning of Decem∣ber 23d, privately withdrew himself, without communicating his design to any of his lords, not even the Earl of Dunbarton, who lay in his chamber, and did not awake till he was gone. The Earl of Ailesbury returned to London; but never took the oaths to King William and Queen Mary. In 1690, whilst King William was in Ireland, the French, after defeating the English fleet under the Earl of Torrington, threatened a descent in England; and Queen Mary, using all precautions to obviate the danger thereof, published a proclamation on July 5th, for apprehending Edward-Henry, Earl of Litchfield, Thomas, Earl of Ailesbury, William, Lord Montgomery (son to William, Marquis of Powis), and divers others, suspected to adhere to their Majesties' enemies in the expected invasion. However, his Lordship was not impri∣soned on that occasion; for on January 5th following, 1690-1, King William gave the royal assent to an act, to enable Thomas Earl of Ailesbury, and Elizabeth Countess of Ailesbury, his wife, to make provision for payment of debts, and to make leases of their estates: and in 1692, when the Queen, on May 9th, (another invasion being threatened) published a proclamation for apprehending Robert Leak, Earl of Scars∣dale, the before-mentioned Earl of Litchfield, and others, the Earl of Ailesbury was not among them, In 1695, the Earl of Ailesbury was said to have been at a meeting,
<PB N="173" REF="203"/>in May, at the Old King's-head tavern in Leadenhall-street, London, with the Lord Montgomery, Sir John Friend, Sir John Fenwick, Mr. Robert Charnock, and others, when they consulted how to restore King James; and all agreed to send a special messenger to desire him to procure of the French King 10,000 men. Bishop Burnet, in his History of his own Time, recites, that after Queen Mary's decease, the Jacobites began to think the government had lost the half of its strength, and fan∣cied an invasion in the King's absence would be an easy attempt; and thereupon sent over to France, Charnock, a fellow of Magdalen college, who in King James's time had turned papist, to let them know they would bring a body of 2,000 horse, to meet such an army as should be sent over. But Charnock came back with a cold account, That nothing could be done at that time. Upon which it was thought necessary to send over a man of quality, who should press the matter with more authority: so the Earl of Ailesbury was prevailed on to go. He was admitted to a secret conversation with the French king, and this gave rise to a design which was very near being executed the following winter. And in 1695-6, when Sir John Friend, on March 23d, and Sir William Perkins, on the 24th, were tried, and suffered for Sir George Barclay's plot, on April 3d following, it appeared, that in May 1695, Charnock had been sent over with a message to King James, as beforementioned: and that the Earl of Ailes∣bury, the Lord Montgomery, and Sir John Fenwick, were also concerned; upon which evidence the Earl of Ailesbury was committed prisoner to the Tower in Fe∣bruary, 1695-6. The bishop further observes, that Peter Cook, son of Sir Miles, being brought to his trial, on May 13th, 1696, was on account of the intended inva∣sion, being not charged with the assassination; and that his trial was considered as introductory to the Earl of Ailesbury's, for the evidence was the same on both. George Porter, and Cardell Goodman, were the two witnesses against him, on his meeting with the Earl of Ailesbury, and others, in Leadenhall-street. All that was brought against their evidence, was (says the bishop) the master of the tavern, and two of his servants, swearing that they remembered well the company which was at the tavern, for they were often coming into the room where they sat both at dinner time, and after it; and they saw not Goodman there, nay, they were positive he was not there. On the other hand, Porter deposed, that Goodman was not with them at dinner, but came after, and sent him a note; upon which he, with the consent of the company, went out and brought him in. The jury considered that the servants of
<PB N="174" REF="204"/>the house were not in constant attendance, nor could they be believed in a negative, against positive evidence to the contrary; and it might be well supposed, that for the interest of their house they might be induced to make stretches; and thereupon Cook was found guilty, and condemned. He obtained many short reprieves, upon assurances he would tell all he knew; but as he did not deal sincerely, his punishment ended in banishment. Sir John Fenwick was next brought to his trial; but Good∣man having been persuaded to go out of England, there were not then two witnesses against him; so by course of law he must have been acquitted: and also on that ac∣count the Earl of Ailesbury never came to his trial. But Sir John Fenwick had confessed (in hopes of pardon) before the lords justices, being on oath, that the Earl of Ailesbury, having been admitted to a private audience of the French king, pro∣posed his sending over an army of 30,000 men, and had undertaken that a great body of gentlemen and horses should be brought to join them: yet at the same time (as observed by bishop Burnet) took care to name none of his own side, except those against whom evidence was already brought (as in the case of the Earl of Ailesbury) or who were safe, and beyond sea: and King William not being satisfied therewith, Sir John was attainted by parliament, and suffered death on January 28th, 1696-7. The Countess of Ailesbury, his wife, was so afflicted at his Lordship's confinement in the Tower, that she died in childbed on January 12th, 1696-7; but the Earl her husband was admitted to bail on February 12th following. His Lordship after∣wards having obtained King William's leave to reside at Brussels, he there married, secondly, Charlotte Countess of Sannu, of the ancient and noble house of Argenteau, in the dutchy of Brabant; and by her, who died at Brussels on July 23d, 1710, N. S. in the 31st year of her age, had an only daughter, Charlotte-Maria, who was married, in 1722, to the Prince of Horne, one of the princes of the empire, and died at Brus∣sels on November 18th, 1736, leaving several children. His Lordship died at Brus∣sels in November, 1741, in the 86th year of his age; and was succeeded in his honours by Charles Lord Bruce, his only surviving son.</P>
<P>CHARLES, THIRD EARL OF AILESBURY, AND FOURTH EARL OF ELGIN, in the lifetime of his father, was summoned by writ to the House of Peers, by the title Lord Bruce, of Whorlton, on December 31st, 1711, the tenth year of Queen Anne: and his late Majesty, by letters patent, bearing date April 17th, 1746, 19th George II. was pleased to create him Lord Bruce, of Tottenham in Wiltshire,
