<LG>
<L>HOW narrow is the sphere a modern Bays</L>
<L>Is doom'd to range, while he contrives his Plays;</L>
<L>Still urg'd by folly, Beings to explore,</L>
<L>Whom <HI>he</HI> and <HI>you</HI> so often saw before:</L>
<L>Precluded characters by <HI>their</HI> advance,</L>
<L>Whose minds could pierce thro' Nature with a glance,</L>
<L>And still of right possess the moral Stage</L>
<L>With lessons studied in a distant age;</L>
<L>In this, our glass, you yet reflected find</L>
<L>The levities which lessen human kind:</L>
<L>The lighter follies which the Town engage,</L>
<L>All that prevail in fashion makes—the Rage;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yes, all! though various be the motly forms,</L>
<L>That sway by weak'ning, or compel in storms:</L>
<L>That up to Fop evaporate the Lord;</L>
<L>Or down to Jockey sink the Maid ador'd;</L>
<L>Confound distinctions, firm and frail perplex,</L>
<L>And make it difficult—to guess even sex.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But is the Rage to levity confin'd?</L>
<L>Does no just passion sway the general mind?</L>
<L>Lo! the rough Veteran, whom his Country's claim,</L>
<L>Rouses to vindicate her injured name!</L>
<L>The <HI>Rage</HI> is <HI>Conquest</HI> which his bosom fires,</L>
<L>The foe yields! then—no! then his rage expires.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When in some dreadful contest on the wave</L>
<L>The gallant seaman finds a wat'ry grave,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB REF="5"/>
<L>E'er the last pulse of ebbing life be o'er,</L>
<L>When the eye turns towards his native shore,</L>
<L>This thought may ev'n the parting pang assuage</L>
<L>That, there—<HI>Humanity</HI> is still the <HI>Rage.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Our Author's Muse follows with fashion's gale,</L>
<L>Down a smooth river an amusive sail;</L>
<L>She dares no sea where boisterous passions sway,</L>
<L>Or merely dips her wing, and hastes away.</L>
<L>O may her airy toil your love engage,</L>
<L>And her new flight to please you be—<HI>The Rage.</HI></L>

<STAGE>SPOKEN <HI>by Mrs,</HI> MATTOCKS.</STAGE>
<LG>
<L>WELL, Gentlefolks, again your most obedient;</L>
<L>That I'm the Epilogue is held expedient:</L>
<L>Our Bard, who for a youth well knows the Stage,</L>
<L>Thought as to speaking, Women were "The Rage,"</L>
<L>And said—"Good Mrs. Mattocks, pray, advance;</L>
<L>Females must now step forward as in France."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>My answer was—my dear, kind Sir, have pity,</L>
<L>"Pray spare the Ladies—Men secure our city.</L>
<L>"For arm'd by Parliament, to calm each fear,</L>
<L>"Huge corps of Common-Councilmen appear,</L>
<L>"Wards, Liveries, Deputies, en Militaire,</L>
<L>"Led by Lieutenant-Colonel—my Lord Mayor!</L>
<L>"Each man, (a sight at which his Lady swoons,)</L>
<L>"Belt, sabre, helmet, spurs, and pantaloons!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Dear Chuck"—says Spouse—"pray sit at home, do yielde,</L>
<L>"Consider, Love, your age; you grow unwieldy;</L>
<L>"Good twenty stone, Dear, cannot play about,</L>
<L>"Besides those cold Jack Boots hurt Lovey's Gout."</L>
<L>"Gout! vulgar nonsense Voman—Gout! Gad's curse,</L>
<L>"Heavy! why I'm a private of Light Horse—</L>
<L>"Dress! wheel! charge!—Could I on Horseback get</L>
<L>"I or my horse would do some mischief yet.'</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus, meaning no offence, in language faint,</L>
<L>The City Rage for soldiering we paint.</L>
<L>But sure no sons of Briton, wish represt</L>
<L>That zeal which leads one man to serve the rest;</L>
<L>Which strives due right and order to maintain,</L>
<L>Against a Chaos that would come again.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB REF="7"/>
<L>Long may such Rage inspire the English mind!</L>
<L>In neighbouring Climes a different "Rage" we find;</L>
<L>Poor <HI>Jean François</HI> who shouts for Liberté</L>
<L>Finds Slavery still the Order of the Day!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Ma foi! he cries—no people blest as we</L>
<L>They force me out to fight to make me free,</L>
<L>Den! vif! alert!—begar we must not tarry,</L>
<L>My Vife, for common good, oblige to marry:</L>
<L>She labour for the State, tant mieux pour elle,</L>
<L>She forget me—I her—c'est Bagatelle!</L>
<L>Allons au Guerre! L'eau de vie banish sorrow,</L>
<L>Victoire to-day—La Guillotine to-morrow!"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>English Tom Blunt, a dealer in small wares,</L>
<L>Who knows a bit what's passing above stairs.</L>
<L>Cries—"Why in that there change of wives so fast</L>
<L>"I think a good one mayhap may come at last,</L>
<L>"But in that <HI>gulleting</HI> machine, d'ye see,</L>
<L>"I've no idea how it makes one free:</L>
<L>"For my part now, whatever may be said,</L>
<L>"I'm for a little meat, and safe warm bed,</L>
<L>"I does not relish freedom—when one's dead;</L>
<L>"So once for all my means and resolution</L>
<L>"Go, to stand by the good old Constitution."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Such and so different reign with sovereign power,</L>
<L>The various "Rages" of the present hour.</L>
<L>I wish, in truth I wish in very spight,</L>
<L>Your Rage may be, to see us many a night.</L>

<HEAD><HI>SCENE I.—DARNLEY'S</HI> Garden, and view of his small Villa.</HEAD>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> DARNLEY <HI>and Sir</HI> GEORGE GAUNTLET.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR GEORGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>AND so, Darnley, you prefer this solitary life, to all the joys of London—to be sure you've a nice snug Villa, and a charming wife here—but its dull—the scene tires—it wants variety, Harry.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Darnley.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Sir George.—Since I retir'd to this peaceful spot, I have not had a wish be∣yond it: I've been so happy in that humble cottage, that when I'm doom'd to leave it, the world will be a waste, and life not have a charm!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir George.</SPEAKER>
<P>How you are alter'd, Darnley? When we were brother officers you were the greatest rake in the regiment; but from the
<PB N="2" REF="9"/>time we were quarter'd at Worcester, where you first beheld Miss Dormer—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Darnley.</SPEAKER>
<P>I saw the folly of my former life; I own'd the power of her superior charms, and leaving a busy and tumultuous world, retir'd with her to this sequester'd scene—'tis now three years since I married.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir George.</SPEAKER>
<P>And from that time to this, have you liv'd in this out-of-the-way place?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Darnley.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes: and till you yesterday honour'd me with a visit, I have not seen a friend within my doors—but isn't it a happy life, Sir George? Our affections have room to shoot—care and distrust are banish'd from our cottage, and with such a woman as Mrs. Darnley to con∣verse with, what is the world to me? I can defy and scorn its malice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir George.</SPEAKER>
<P>She's an angelic creature indeed, Darnley: and at Worcester, I had myself near∣ly fallen a victim to her charms; but about your future life—do you mean to live for ever in these woods and meadows?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Darnley.</SPEAKER>
<P>No—would to heaven I could!—I fear I must forego my present calm, and mix in active life again: When I married, I sold my commission, you remember, to purchase this small farm—Mrs. Darnley's portion was but a trifle, and an encreasing family has so enlarg'd my expences, that unless I return to the army—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir George.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah—you want to be raking again?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Darnley.</SPEAKER>
<P>No—I want to secure an indepen∣dence for my family—I want to see my chil∣dren affluent, and to attain this, I have once more applied to my uncle Sir Paul Perpetual,
<PB N="3" REF="10"/>who was so offended at my selling out, that he has ever since abandon'd me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir George.</SPEAKER>
<P>What—does the old beau still persevere in his resentment?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Darnley.</SPEAKER>
<P>His anger has encreas'd; for he writes me word; he intends marrying Lady Sa∣rah Savage, on purpose to have heirs more worthy his estate:—Oh! my friend:—'tis hard, that fortune should bestow such treasures, and then compel me to desert them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir George.</SPEAKER>
<P>So it is: but now I think on't, this Lady Sarah Savage and her brother are my intimate friends; and as you are their neighbours, I'll introduce you and Mrs. Darn∣ley to their notice—When are they expected from town?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Darnley.</SPEAKER>
<P>To day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir George.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then we'll pay them a visit: Lady Sarah Savage shall interfere with your uncle, and if that fails, her brother can easily ensure your promotion in the army—but see; here's Mrs. Darnley?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Darnley.</SPEAKER>
<P>Look at her, Sir George—do you, can you blame me?—who would not act as I have done?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir George.</SPEAKER>
<P>I would by heav'ns!—I'd live with her in a hermitage!—die with her on a pilgrimage!—I'd—sdeath: if I don't mind, I shall discover all.</P>
<STAGE>Aside.</STAGE>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter Mrs.</HI> DARNLEY.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Darnley advancing to her.</SPEAKER>
<P>Maria!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Darnley.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh Harry!—I have been look∣ing for you every where—I declare you're grown quite a truant—Before your friend came, you
<PB N="4" REF="11"/>us'd to walk with me over the farm: or ride with me to see our children; or sit and read to me under our favourite Beach Tree—but now—Sir George!—I beg your pardon—I didn't see you before.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir George.</SPEAKER>
<P>Madam!</P>
<STAGE>Bowing obsequiously.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Darnley.</SPEAKER>
<P>My friend is all kindness, Maria; he has promis'd to introduce me to the honour∣able Mr. Savage:</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Darnley.</SPEAKER>
<P>What:—take you to Savage house!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Darnley.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay—why not:—you shall go with me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Darnley.</SPEAKER>
<P>No—let me stay here—I am not weary of my present life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Darnley.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nor I—but 'tis a great connexion: and though not absolutely distress'd, I would improve my fortune—I would see you and my children have every comfort.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Darnley.</SPEAKER>
<P>We have, while you are with us—consider we have never liv'd a day apart, and if they lure you into fashionable scenes, you'll be corrupted, Harry—you'll despise the humble roof you once rever'd, and I perhaps shall be forgotten and neglected.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Darnley.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never!—I cannot bear the suppo∣sition; and while we have hearts to endure, and hands to labour, there is sufficient for our cottage!—I will not go—My friend, who sees my motive, I'm sure, will not condemn me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir George.</SPEAKER>
<P>No—always obey the Ladies; but Darnley, I see our horses—you recollect we were to ride to see your children: so, Ma∣dam, I have the superlative honour—</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><PB N="5" REF="12"/><HI>Enter</HI> CLARA SEDLEY—<HI>a basket of flowers is hanging on her arm, and she is eating an apple.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir George.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, Clara!—been picking flowers my angel!—well!—I thought they had all died—all died from envy egad! ha! ha!—excuse me—I never laugh but at my own wit.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clara.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you? then you laugh very sel∣dom, I believe.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir George.</SPEAKER>
<P>No—very often: for I take the joke though nobody else does, ha! ha!—come Darnley—adieu Ladies—I'll not run away with him!—</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>(Exit Darnley and Sir George.)</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clara.</SPEAKER>
<P>What a coxcomb it is!—and if he wasn't a duellist into the bargain, I'd tell Mr. Darnley all my suspicions—that I would—but he's so fond of fighting, that I heard him say, he once sent a man a challenge for wafering a letter instead of sealing it.—I wish he was gone.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Darnley.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed so do I, cousin—Mr. Darnley is so chang'd since he arriv'd—his ideas so enlarg'd—he talks of visiting at Savage House, of improving his fortune.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clara.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fortune!—ay: and this morning he gave me his note for two hundred pounds, beg∣ging me to get one of my guardians to lend money upon it—his excuse was that his expen∣ces exceeded his income, and by his uncle's marriage with Lady Sarah Savage, all his ex∣pectations were ruined—Now, my life on't, this is all Sir George's doings—He has stole into our cottage like the Arch-fiend into paradise, and I won't eat another apple while he stays!</P>
<STAGE>(Throws away the apple she is eating.)</STAGE>

<SPEAKER>Clara.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't be unhappy—I shall apply to both my guardians; Sir Paul and Mr. Flush, they are now at Bath, and one way or other the Villa shall flourish still—Lord! I shall have plenty of money when I come of age, and I'll throw it all into the scale, and come and plant, sow, and reap with you and your husband.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Darnley.</SPEAKER>
<P>What give up the gaieties of London, cousin?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clara.</SPEAKER>
<P>London! ay: I hate it—I once pass'd a month there, but they hurried me so from sight to sight, that in the bustle all places ap∣pear'd alike—I saw no difference—And, if you'll believe me, one morning after seeing West∣minster Hall in term time, they took me in∣side Bedlam; and so confus'd was I, that I didn't know the lawyers and their clients, from the keepers and their patients.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. Darnley.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well Clara: if Lady Sarah Savage be a picture of town-bred women of fashion, let me remain a plain simple rustic all my life—Did you ever see any thing so confi∣dent—so masculine—her brother too! "What you call impudence," says he, "we call ease."</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clara.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay: they're a precious pair; and yet in London they are both the Rage!—quite at the top of the beau monde—But, cousin, they've order'd their carriages, and insist on our going to Savage house—Mercy on us! what's to become of two lambs amongst such a parcel of wolves?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Darnley.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is Sir George's scheme: to delude Mr. Darnley from this tranquil spot into fashionable life, is the first step towards af∣fecting his base designs—He told Mr. Savage about your fortune too—</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>I know it: and the vulgar man made downright love to me directly;—'faith-Coz. I believe Sir George wants to get me married, and you unmarried.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clara.</SPEAKER>
<P>"She'll whip and gallop them!" there now!—this is one of the modern breed of
<PB N="12" REF="19"/>fine ladies, who, instead of being feminine and tender, have the Rage for confidence and bold∣ness—Look at her dress—she's more like a man than a woman, and her language is as mascu∣linè as her manners.</P>

</SP>

<P>Excuse me, madam: when I reflect, that Sir Paul is Mr. Darnley's uncle, and by your union he is deprived of all his future fortune, you cannot blame me, if —</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Sarah.</SPEAKER>
<P>Deprive my dear Darnley of his fortune!—so it does—well!—that's vastly droll!—but then it makes mine, which is the same thing you know—See!—here's my bear of a brother!—you've no idea what low, vulgar company he keeps?—nothing but Buffoons, Bow-street Officers, and Boxers!—and only conceive, my dear, me and my friends mixing in such horrid society.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Darnley.</SPEAKER>
<P>Surely Mr. Savage cannot wish—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Sarah.</SPEAKER>
<P>He does, ma'am: and only con∣ceive I say my intimate acquaintance—people of the first consequence—such as Signor Cyg∣net, the husband of the fine Soprano—Monsieur Puppitini, the inventor of the dear Fantoccini, and Count Spavin the greatest of Horse Doctors—only imagine such pick'd com∣pany
<PB N="14" REF="21"/>as this, mixing with my brother's low-liv'd wretched crew.</P>

<STAGE><HI>Enter the Honourable Mr.</HI> SAVAGE.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Savage.</SPEAKER>
<P>So Savage—sister I mean—I lost ten pounds by your silly accident—The moment I saw the horses off, I said to my friends around me, ten pounds to five, the driver gets a tum∣ble—"done!"—"it's a bett" says I—away flew the racers,—snap went the reins—five to four in my savour!—when plague on't! the Squire rode across, stopt the carriage—you sav'd your neck, and I—lost my wager.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Sarah.</SPEAKER>
<P>You brute: did you ever hear your brother, Lord Savage, talk in this man∣ner?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Savage.</SPEAKER>
<P>My brother!—pough!—he's a gen∣tleman to be sure—proud, independent, and all in the grandee style—but I!—I'm not like him—I'm a man of fashion—I'm not a gentleman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Sarah.</SPEAKER>
<P>No—that you are not upon my honour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Savage.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am the hero of my society—he is the slave of his—he keeps high company, ma'am <STAGE>(To Mrs. Darnley,)</STAGE> lives with judges, generals, and admirals—but does he ever encourage the arts and sciences? does he ever shake hands with men of genius? such as peace officers, tennis play'rs, and boxers—no, no—that was left for me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Sarah.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes: and though born to wealth and titles, there you stand, that have been six times bottle holder at a boxing match!—vulgar science!—I hope Sir Paul don't understand it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="15" REF="22"/>
<SPEAKER>Savage.</SPEAKER>
<P>No—not now—but if he makes you his wife, it may be necessary he should, learn,— I say, ma'am, that was a straight one—wasn't it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Darnley.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed I don't know, sir; —Wou'd Mr. Darnley were here!—I am unequal to their society; but from the lit∣tle I have learnt, I think one hour of domes∣tic life worth all this new unintelligible scene.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Savage.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hark'ye: <STAGE>(to Lady Sarah,)</STAGE> here's a letter from the old beau, Sir Paul—he is coming to Bath, and can only stay one day with us, in his way; but as people of quality are not always people of quantity you know, he shan't stir, till the marriage is effected—mum!—I'll keep him close—</P>

<P>Sir, I am unus'd to visiting; unfit—</P>

<P>Nonsense!—I never take an excuse; when I ask people to my house, I make them go when I like—stay while I like, and behave as I like—so come along—squire mind you don't snap the reins; and d'ye hear; as my sister is rather lame—only just recover'd from the gout—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Sarah.</SPEAKER>
<P>The gout!—how dare you, sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Savage.</SPEAKER>
<P>What!—do you deny it?—do you disown having been our'd by a quack doctor, and returning him thanks in all the papers? <Q>Lady Sarah Savage informs Dr. Panacea, that his alagaronic antispasmodonic tincture, has entirely remov'd the gout from the extremi∣ties,
<PB N="16" REF="23"/>and she now hunts, shoots, eats and drinks more freely than ever!</Q>—now isn't it a shame, ma'am? between them, they plun∣der both the patient and the physician.—The quack cheats the doctor of his fee, and the woman robs the man of his gout.</P>

<P>No—more like a Friar in one—at least if I may judge by my eating and drinking— But my friend—this is a glorious place, and I begin to think I've liv'd too long out of the world—coop'd up in a cottage—buried in a farm—What did I know of life and all its plea∣sures?</P>

<P>What! make me love her whether I will or not?</P>

<P>Why?—what's the matter with you!—what's that letter?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Darnley.</SPEAKER>
<P>This letter?—this is a love letter, my angel,—ha!—why it is!—it is my wife!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Darnley.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes: that wife who in the hour of dissipation you forget—can I believe it?—in a little hour can all our past attachment—but why am I alarmed?—Fashion may dupe the wicked and the weak, but virtue such as his must scorn its empty power.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Darnley.</SPEAKER>
<P>Forget!—no never!—and now I look at you—I think I ought to be massacred for having even for a moment neglected you—Oh Maria!—I have such news for you—Lady Sarah has been so kind—she has promised to promote me—to befriend you—and in short she has taken a liking to the whole family.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Darnley.</SPEAKER>
<P>And why, Harry?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Darnley.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why! ay: there's the rub! but don't be jealous, Maria—I entreat you, don't be jealous!—for by heaven, I love you!—I do so ten∣derly that if it were not for my promise, I could find in my heart to return home directly.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. Darnly.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do; let us begone—the place distracts me: and I fear this high company will corrupt you.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Darnley.</SPEAKER>
<P>High company!—hang it:—if that's all you're afraid of, there's not much danger in this house I fancy—but my letter—my word to Sir George—and consider our interest, Maria.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Darnley.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh no—consult our happiness my love; and surely there is none in this tumultu∣ous scene—we left all joy behind us, in our children and our cottage, Harry; and there alone we shall recover it—come.</P>

<SPEAKER>Sir George.</SPEAKER>
<P>Won't you?—then I'll prove it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Darnley.</SPEAKER>
<P>I defy you!—he knows the value of my heart too well to trifle with it; and I've known his so long, that I'll not venture to suspect it—no—though his friend defames it.</P>

<P>Ha!—it is too plain—I am deceiv'd—deserted.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir George.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was the bearer of that letter, and preserv'd it merely to shew it you, I thought it the duty of a friend.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Darnley.</SPEAKER>
<P>And from the same duty, you advis'd him to write it.—Oh! I have known you long, Sir George—you are one of those who find no happiness but in marring that of others—who seduce the affections of the husband, the better to betray the honour of the wife! and when you've spoilt all social and domestic peace, the
<PB N="27" REF="34"/>friend you laugh at, and the woman scorn!—I know you well!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir George.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear ma'am, how you mistake!—I meant to oblige you.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Darnley.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir—there is but one way—leave me—nay, I insist—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir George.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall obey.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Darnley.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must have stronger proof be∣fore I am convinc'd, and then observe, Sir George, if his truth weakens, I'll add strength to mine! my constancy and honour shall be so ex∣emplary, that I will shame him from his follies! make him repent: and when reclaim'd, be proud to say he is my own again!</P>

<SPEAKER>Clara.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes: yes: its all over the House—Sir George makes no secret of the assignation, and I've no doubt but Darnley is now in that room waiting for Lady Sarah Savage—she can't come at present—the servant says, she's gone to the stables to see the beasts unharness'd—faith! if she'd go to her brother's party she'd see that business already done!—however I'll pre∣vent Darnley's exposing himself, and as he is certainly conceal'd in that room, I'll talk to him.—Dear!—here's my guardian again!</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Paul.</SPEAKER>
<P>So far, I'm safe, my dear girl; you don't know what your poor guardian has suf∣fer'd in this high—no—this low-lif'd house!—they forc'd me into a room full of buffoons, boxers, and blacklegs—made me drink a bowl of punch, and I'd as soon drink so much poison—then winking and nodding they began whispering pretty loudly—"smoke the old prig!—damme, quiz him!"</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clara.</SPEAKER>
<P>Quiz him!—what's that, Guardy?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Paul.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, with our young men of qua∣lity, quizzing is a substitute for wit, my dear; so one man challeng'd me to play on the violin, and when I rose to move my elbows, another whip'd the chair from under me; a second put hot coals into my pocket, so when I felt for my hankerchief, I burnt my fingers; a third tried to cut off my tail, but that assassin I pursued, when unluckily in running after him, they had tied a string across the stairs, and I pitch'd headforemost into a <HI>barrel</HI> of water, they had placed for the purpose.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clara.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, its quite terrible, Gaurdy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Paul.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then they shew'd me a license; brought me a fat parson, and said, if I'd in∣stantly be married, they'd let me go to find my son—if not, I should be lock'd in, and have plenty of it—now here's hospitality!—but they've overshot the mark; and if I get out of their doors, I'll not only break off the match, but promise to befriend Darnley.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clara.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! disappoint Lady Sarah, and relieve my poor distressed friend—then I'll get you out
<PB N="29" REF="36"/>of the house—I will, if I'm quizz'd to death for it—You see that door—if he meets Darnley, he'll at least interrupt the assignation.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Paul.</SPEAKER>
<P>Secure my escape—only get me out of this den of savages, and, if I don't befriend Darnley, may I never live to see old age. Where does that door lead to?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clara.</SPEAKER>
<P>I fancy to Lady Sarah's dressing room; for it is full of half boots, horse great coats, mi∣litary sashes, helmet caps, and amazonian jack∣ets! and this is your only way to escape—enter that room.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Paul.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clara.</SPEAKER>
<P>Put on one of Lady Sarah Savage's great coats, tie one of her sashes round your waist—throw a fur tippet about your neck, and with a whip in your hand, and her driv∣ing hat on your head—</P>

<P>Oh, ay: now I recollect; you must excuse me; we people of rank are so very absent; we're extremely intimate with a person in the morning, and don't know them at night; well! I'm vastly glad to see you; but you mustn't stay here, I'm engaged child.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. Darnley.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hear me, madam! when I first saw you, I was the happiest of women—I had a husband who lov'd and honour'd me—who doat∣ed on his children, and knew no pleasure but in his family! and now how severe is the reverse! you have robb'd me of that treasure, seduc'd it from my heart, and I return to a melancholy home, without a friend for my own distresses, or a father for my children!</P>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. Darnley.</SPEAKER>
<P>Great world!—there again, madam!—when I enter'd this house, I expected from the exalted rank of its owner to have been surrounded with kindness, elegance, and hospita∣lity!—but I find that high birth doesn't create high breeding, nor am I, because humbly born, less likely to set a polish'd example than yourself—Oh Darnley! why will you not come forth and save your once lov'd wife from agonies too great to bear.</P>

<P>Ay, sir, your son always spoke his mind too freely—in short, Mr. Gingham was too honest for his profession.</P>

<P>He was; however he has given me his word, never to speak what comes uppermost, and he is now what he ought to be; a regular, so∣lemn, jesuitical—in short—he's a very promising young man.</P>

<P>That I did, sir; and I'll prove I said so—the other night I slept at the west end, and two friends—distress'd old officers in the army—brought their notes to be discounted—says I, <Q>Gentlemen, it won't do—you'll get little cash, but a quantity of trumpery nonsense, such as hams, cheeses, prints, linens, and other ve∣getables!</Q> said they; <Q>we know that—we know you and your father are two infernal sharpers, but a guinea now is worth ten a month hence—so give us the money.</Q></P>

<SPEAKER>Gingham.</SPEAKER>
<P>Always—its vulgar to be in the city of an evening; besides I like to walk in Kensington-gardens in the morning—You know Kensington-gardens, father—the place where there's such a mixture of green leaves and brown powder—of blue violets and yellow shoes; and where there's such a croud, that to get air and exercise you stand a chance of broken bones and suffocation!—Well!—there I strut away, my boys—</P>

<SPEAKER>Gingham.</SPEAKER>
<P>Business!—no never—Did I, Ready? I recollected my father play'd the same game before me; that when he was clerk at the lottery-of∣fice, at billiards all the morning, and at hazard all the evening—therefore, says I, where's the diffe∣rence?—none! but that he had the policy to conceal his tricks, and I the folly to shew mine—heh!

<P>Hold your tongue, or I'll knock it down your throat, sirrah.—I say, Clara, in the the way of business, I've no objection to do Mr. Darnley a service; that is, if I can make a pro∣fit by it—first, he should send me his note.</P>

<P>Don't you? Why, now, did I ever mention, sir, that you got these pictures by sue∣ing out execution? That you got that plate, by its being pawn'd to you for half its value; that you intrigue with a female money-lender; and that the last time you were made a bankrupt,

<P>Well, if it must be so—farewell, father! the world is all before me, and what trade to follow, heaven only knows. Good bye, madam!—your sex will never befriend me, be∣cause I can't keep a secret, you see.</P>

<P>I will befriend you, sir; for while there is so much deception and hypocrisy in the world, it would indeed be unjust, not to ap∣prove such frankness and honesty. Guardy, let me intercede for him; I'll answer for his con∣duct.</P>

<SPEAKER>Gingham.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nor shall I, yours; and if fortune smiles on me, I'll prove that I deserve your kindness—If ever my father pardons—but I see he's more and more angry, so I take my leave. May every blessing attend you—may you meet with a heart as liberal as your own—May your

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir George.</SPEAKER>
<P>You see I am; and that he esteems me more than ever, is evident from his bringing Mrs. Darnley to my house—did you mind his orders to her?—take an airing my dear with Sir George in his phaeton! it will raise your spirits, my love!—Ha! ha! he absolutely throws her into my arms.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Sarah.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; but she absolutely contrives to get out of them again.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir George.</SPEAKER>
<P>She does; and therefore, there is no way but the one I mentioned—we must make Darnley jealous.</P>

<P>True:—I'll tell him that you love his wife.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir George.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, nay, not me—fix on some∣body else—we'll soon find an object, and then by convincing him of her falsehood, he naturally turns his thoughts to another woman; which is you, you know—and she wanting a protector, consequently flies to another man, which is me, you know we'll add the Signor to the confede∣racy.</P>

<P>You're a sad wretch—a sad wretch indeed, Sir George, to impose on a friend, who places such confidence—such—I won't hear you—positively I won't hear you—only observe, if I don't win the cruel Darnley's affections, I'll drive my Phaeton down a precipice in reality; I will, or with the bayonet of my fusil, pierce my too tender heart, and expire at his feet.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Sarah.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never: but when I think of you brother, then I think more than I say, I assure you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Savage.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; you say more than you think, I assure you—but would you believe it? The old boy has seen his son,—we trac'd him from the stage coach he came in, to the pump room, from the pump room, to the billiard room—there Sir Paul saw him playing with the marker, and when he heard the young man's name, he fainted; actually fainted in my arms.</P>

<P>Long before he recover'd, the young man was gone—the bird was flown—for the standers by, all blacklegs began laying betts on Sir Paul's recovery, and those who were against him, wouldn't let water be thrown in his face.</P>

<P>Inhuman wretches!—they ought to have sous'd him to death: but pray, brother, who is this child? where does he come from? what's the story?</P>

<P>Why—about twenty years ago, Sir Paul's lady quarrell'd with him at Tunbridge, and married a citizen—Four months after the mar∣riage she had a son, which the citizen brought up as his own, and Sir Paul now swears the boy was his—'gad! it will be curious; for the child will have two fathers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Sarah.</SPEAKER>
<P>Curious! not at all—but why should you meddle?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Savage.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because it secures me the two best racers in his stud—Fidget and Fizgig; and what's better, because it still secures us Sir Paul's fortune: for though he won't marry you him∣self, he intends his son should; and, if I could but once more see the young man—I know he goes by his mother's name— <STAGE>(Looking out)</STAGE> heh! its him! there he is again!—get out of the way; don't interrupt—</P>
</SP>

<P>No—I have too great a regard for Sir Paul's property to interrupt any plan for securing it; besides, Sir George and I have bu∣siness—come—I say brother, tell the old gentle∣man to be careful, and in his eagerness bid him not claim another man's child instead of his own!</P>

<P>Well, well—I can afford it—but, Sir Paul, there is only one way he can make me retribution—you've heard of our ward's copper mines, and though you have only known me as a private gentleman, and I you as joint guar∣dian—yet I think you will consent to her marrying the man I propose.</P>

<P>And what house is that?</P>

<P>I never was there but twice—the first time there was a motion about relieving poor insolvent debtors, and the house was so empty I got an ague.
