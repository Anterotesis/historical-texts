<HEAD>To the Gentlemen, Clergy, Freeholders, and other Inhabitants, of the</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE last general meeting of the County of York having adopted a proposition <Q><HI>to shorten the duration of parliament to a term not exceeding three years,</HI></Q> the worthy gentlemen of your own committee may probably have been induced, by the laudable desire of preserving <HI>unanimity</HI> with that respecta∣ble county, to recommend the same pro∣position for your adoption. Be pleased, therefore, previously to consider, whe∣ther it is probable that a majority of the freeholders, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of the Yorkshire meet∣ing did really mean to prefer <HI>triennial elections</HI> to the ancient legal usage and constitution of <HI>annual parliaments,</HI> or whether they may not rather have been induced to postpone the open declara∣tion of their <HI>loyal</HI> attachment to that an∣cient <HI>law</HI> for frequent parliaments, <HI>(viz.
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>
every year once, and more often if need be,)</HI> merely through a desire to preserve the <HI>unanimity</HI> of their <HI>own meeting,</HI> by yield∣ing a little, for the present, to the preju∣dices of a few particular gentlemen a∣mong them, (persons, indeed, of great worth and esteem, in many respects, and whose sentiments in general deserve the utmost attention and regard, but) who unhappily, in this point, are apt to conceive, that <HI>annual</HI> elections, and <Q><HI>more often if need be,</HI></Q> would be attended with some inconveniences to <HI>themselves.</HI></P>
<P>You have undoubtedly, in your own county, also, several worthy gentlemen of fortune, to whom great respect is due from <HI>the people,</HI> on account of their known independence, and steady oppo∣sition to bad measures in general, who nevertheless, perhaps, may entertain <HI>the same erroneous conceptions of frequent e∣lections;</HI> and therefore you can, by your own feelings, (I mean your respect and
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
esteem for such worthy men,) more ea∣sily judge of <HI>the effect</HI> which the same kind of laudable influence must necessa∣rily have caused in the Yorkshire meet∣ing; which is the best reason, I believe, that can be assigned for their having adopted that <HI>unconstitutional</HI> measure.</P>
<P>You are therefore most earnestly re∣quested to consider the following plain propositions.</P>
<P N="1">I. That, though great deference and respect be certainly due to such worthy and independent gentlemen as I have described, yet your condescension to them ought to have some <HI>due limitation.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. That the bounds of the <HI>ancient parliamentary constitution</HI> of the king∣dom ought surely to mark out <HI>the ut∣most extent</HI> of your compliance with the worthy part of the <HI>aristocratical interest.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. That if, on the contrary, your endeavours to preserve UNANIMITY
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
should carry you <HI>beyond these legal bounds,</HI> you will really injure those very gentle∣men whom you wish to oblige, as well as the whole <HI>aristocratical interest</HI> (the crown, the lords, the country gentle∣men in general); because there is but <HI>one true common interest,</HI> which <HI>the fun∣damental laws of the constitution alone can preserve.</HI> Consider also,</P>
<P N="4">IV. That <HI>unanimity</HI> is as <HI>baneful</HI> in a bad measure as it is <HI>salutary</HI> in a good one: and,</P>
<P N="5">V. That, if any <HI>compliance</HI> in proceed∣ings is to be made at all <Q><HI>for the sake of unanimity,</HI></Q> it ought certainly to be made where a <HI>compliance is most due;</HI> viz. to the <HI>constitutional resolutions</HI> of a select body of intelligent gentlemen, <HI>deputed to a national conference,</HI> by freely-elected committees from a very considerable pro∣portion of the counties and most populous cities and towns in England;—to resolu∣tions, which were <HI>unanimously</HI> agreed upon by the said <HI>deputies;</HI> and, therefore,
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
<HI>"a compliance, for the sake of unanimity,"</HI> was most justly due to <HI>them;</HI> and, the more especially, as it appears that they formed their conclusions by the funda∣mental laws and usages of the constitu∣tion. <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">The deputies, in their memorial, declare, that <Q><HI>shortening the duration of the sitting of parliament can only be done,</HI> CONSISTENTLY WITH THE CONSTITUTION, <HI>or with the best policy in any enlarged view,</HI> BY SHORT∣ENING IT TO THE PERIOD OF A YEAR.</Q> And this they farther explain in the words of the old statutes, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q><HI>that a parliament should be holden</HI> ONCE <HI>every year, and</HI> MORE OFTEN <HI>if need be;</HI></Q> from whence it is manifest, that <HI>the longest duration, consistent with the constitution, is the period of one single session,</HI> even though two or more such sessions should be necessary in <HI>one</HI> or <HI>the same</HI> year.</NOTE> The striking, similarity also of <HI>this deputation,</HI> in many respects, to an anci∣ent example of a <HI>national deputation</HI> from all the counties, cited, on this occasion, by lord Carysfort,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 15 of his lordship's very judicious and <HI>loyal</HI> letter to the committee of the county of Huntingdon.</NOTE> from Hoveden, adds great weight to the resolutions in ques∣tion, as well as to the importance of that <HI>unanimity</HI> with which they were formed.</P>
<P N="6">VI. That the members of the late depu∣tation have <HI>unanimously</HI> declared, in their
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
memorial, that <Q><HI>annual parliaments</HI> are the <HI>ancient constitution</HI> of this kingdom, and the <HI>birthright of Englishmen;</HI></Q> and, in the three last paragraphs of their <HI>memo∣rial,</HI> which are highly worthy your most careful attention, have not only proved that the old <HI>laws,</HI> requiring <Q>a par∣liament to be holden every year once, and more often if need be,</Q> meant a <HI>new</HI> parliament <HI>every year, &amp;c.</HI> (by the instan∣ces of writs issued <Q>two or three times in the same year, for new elections,</Q>) but they also prove, from the experience of former ages, that these <HI>very frequent elec∣tions</HI> were <HI>not</HI> attended with any such in∣conveniences, as the advocates for long parliaments commonly pretend, but, on the contrary, recommend them, <HI>"as consistent with the greatest peace," &amp;c.</HI>—<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>The fact is, (say the deputies from the several peti∣tioning counties, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>) during the whole of that reign, (king Edw. III.) and for the first eighteen years of the following one, writs were annually issued, and, in some instances, two or three times in the same year, for new elections, till Richard II. made himself absolute. And various were the occasions, in those times, when the commons gave for answer, to any new propositions of magnitude, that THEY DARED NOT AGREE WITH∣OUT CONFERENCE WITH THEIR COUNTRIES. At what period then was it, that the consent of the people was asked and obtained to so momentous a proposal as that of divesting them of their expected controul over their representatives? in fact, of changing the terms on which the delegation had passed from their hands? AN∣NUAL PARLIAMENTS are, therefore, the ANCIENT CONSTITUTION of England, and the BIRTHRIGHT of Englishmen.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Nor are they less beneficial in policy than unalienable in right. In the language of ancient times, before the prejudices of habit had thrown false colours over names and things, <HI>they were ever described as consistent with the greatest peace, and most peaceably conducted.</HI> And, in par∣liamentary records, for more than two hundred years together, from 49 Hen. III. till 22 Edw. IV. we find not so much as <HI>one</HI> double return, nor more than two or three instances of elections questioned on any ground;— a circumstance surely most inviting, when put in contrast with that multitude of perplexing enquiries which, of late years, hath consumed so much time in committees, to the great hindrance of the national business. The plain reason is founded not in the time, but in the na∣ture, of the thing; the duration of the seat was not an object for a violent contest. This will also dispel the objection arising from the probability of tumult and ex∣pensiveness; to remove which it will farther contribute not a little, if we would give attention to what passes now among those large bodies of electors, who annual∣ly choose their corporate officers. But the argument a∣gainst corruption surmounts every thing else. Nothing can give so much assurance of defeating it as this limita∣tion. A seat for three years might induce a man's at∣tention to a bribe. He that sits but for one is very un∣likely to experience such an offer, or will certainly re∣ject it, if he would not wish to put all his future expec∣tations to an imminent risque.</Q></P>
<P><Q>When once the constitution of parliament is improved in these leading points, every thing else, that may ap∣pear to have its share in reformation, must be subordi∣nate in its class, and must follow in its time. And, the more effectually to insure these, we entreat you, nei∣ther at the next or any future election, to engage your support to any candidate, before you are satisfied that he will give his assistance, in parliament, to the esta∣blishment of so much of these reforms as may not then be accomplished.</Q></P></NOTE>
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
And, therefore, you are desired to consi∣der,</P>
<P N="7"><PB N="10" REF="9"/>VII. That the Yorkshire proposition for shortening <Q>the duration of parlia∣ments to a term, not exceeding three years,</Q> is totally different from the <HI>shortening of duration,</HI> explained and re∣commended by the said deputies, as <Q>the ancient constitution of the kingdom, and the birthright of Englishmen;</Q> and, what is worse, has been adopted without the least mention of that <HI>birthright</HI> in any saving clause, to assert and preserve your just claim to it for a <HI>future</HI> time: where∣by it is manifest, that the promoters of this <HI>triennial</HI> scheme have really been <HI>the first
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>
offenders</HI> against that desirable <HI>unanimity,</HI> which the conference of deputies was in∣tended to effect; and, therefore, the cry of <HI>"necessary unanimity,"</HI> by which alone that <HI>unconstitutional</HI> proposition is at pre∣sent recommended, deserves not the least attention. What! would you be <HI>unani∣mous</HI> against the ancient legal parliamen∣tary constitution of the kingdom, which the <HI>triennial</HI> scheme is manifestly calcu∣lated to supplant? You ought never to forget,</P>
<P N="8">VIII. That the people have already been betrayed by a <HI>triennial</HI> parliament! That the <HI>representatives</HI> of the people, in a <HI>triennial</HI> parliament, usurped the le∣gislative authority of their constituents for a longer time than it was delegated; and treacherously presumed, <Q>without con∣sulting their countries,</Q> to prolong the duration of parliaments to the present unreasonable term of <HI>seven</HI> years; where∣by
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>
by they established the basis of that de∣testable system of corruption which has been the true source of all your present grievances! And, therefore, be pleased to consider, —</P>
<P N="9">IX. That <HI>triennial</HI> parliaments, as well as <HI>septennial,</HI> are manifestly dangerous to the state, and so grossly inconsistent with the ancient legal parliamentary con∣stitution of this kingdom, that the most essential <HI>laws</HI> and <HI>usages,</HI> by which that constitution is declared and known, are really <HI>suspended</HI> by them. You cannot, therefore, without notorious <HI>disloyalty,</HI> (in the strictest sense of the word,) adopt the proposition for <HI>triennial</HI> parliaments: so that you have a most ample excuse for not concurring with a few particular gentle∣men, (whom you would otherwise wish to oblige,) <HI>viz.</HI> that your <HI>compliance</HI> with them, in this matter would exceed the <HI>constituti∣onal</HI> bounds of condescension, (mentioned
<PB N="13" REF="12"/>
in the three first propositions,) and would really tend to subvert the people's just right <HI>to more frequent elections.</HI> — Be∣cause it is manifest, —</P>
<P N="10">X. That the <HI>concession</HI> of a popular right, made by the people themselves in their collective capacity, at their several county-meetings, is infinitely more bind∣ing upon them (to exclude any future claim to the ceded right) than the same <HI>concession</HI> would be, if made merely by their <HI>representatives</HI> in parliament, with∣out the instruction or concurrence of the people. And, therefore, you ought to be particularly thankful, —</P>
<P N="11">XI. That the people themselves, the great body of constituents, have never yet, by any such <HI>concession,</HI> betrayed that valuable <HI>birthright,</HI> (as the deputies call it,) the ancient <HI>law</HI> for <HI>annual</HI> parlia∣ments. It has too often been <HI>suspended</HI> indeed; sometimes through the <HI>disloyalty</HI>
<PB N="14" REF="13"/>
of kings, and lastly even by the <HI>disloyalty</HI> of parliament itself, (of which the tyran∣nical <HI>triennial</HI> and <HI>septennial</HI> acts are la∣mentable instances); yet, as the <HI>suspen∣sion</HI> of it has never been promoted by the requisition or instruction of the peo∣ple at large, their right to it remains in∣tire. The presumption and treachery of their representatives, in consenting to the <HI>triennial</HI> and <HI>septennial</HI> acts, cannot in∣jure their just title to it; because, in both these instances, the representatives pre∣sumed to act contrary to an established rule of parliament, by adopting a <HI>new device,</HI> (which even affected a fundamen∣tal law of the kingdom,) <Q>without con∣sulting their countries,</Q> which the con∣stitution absolutely requires in such an important case; so that even that unwar∣rantable presumption of the representa∣tives (in neglecting to consult the people) is the very circumstance which still pre∣serves
<PB N="15" REF="14"/>
that fundamental and essential law <HI>as a part of the constitution,</HI> and as a just right of the people, which they are en∣titled to demand and resume whenever they shall be pleased to instruct their re∣presentatives for that purpose; and to charge all persons with <HI>disloyalty,</HI> and e∣ven <HI>treason to the constitution,</HI> who shall dare to oppose them! But if, on the contrary, the <HI>people themselves, in their several county-courts,</HI> or <HI>assemblies,</HI> should be so inconsiderate, or so depraved, as to consent indiscriminately to the proposi∣tion for a <HI>triennial</HI> election, without a sa∣ving clause to assert their <HI>birthright</HI> and reserve their title to more frequent elec∣tions, (which the Yorkshire meeting has unwarily done,) know, for a certainty,—</P>
<P N="12">XII. That, in such an unhappy inat∣tention to their own rights, (which, I pray to God, they may never be cursed with,) they would <HI>betray</HI> the constitution
<PB N="16" REF="15"/>
of the kingdom! — they would betray a fundamental <HI>law</HI> of their ancestors; which would mark their character with an eternal stain of <HI>disloyalty!</HI> And as they may, perhaps, never have again so fa∣vourable an opportunity, as the present, of recovering their ancient birthright of <HI>annual elections,</HI> it would probably be lost, irretrievably lost, for ever! Your new triennial representatives (in such a case) would most likely behave as former triennial representatives have heretofore done, — <HI>betray and enslave you by another septennial system of corruption!</HI> And (what is worse) you yourselves would <HI>most justly deserve it!</HI></P>
<P>But I hope better things of you; and I trust also that you will excuse the seve∣rity of my expressions in this address, as being prompted merely by an ardent zeal for your prosperity.</P>
