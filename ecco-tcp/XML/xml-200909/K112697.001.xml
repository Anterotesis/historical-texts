<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>EVERY work on the subject of Topography, founded on au∣thentic records, and executed with accuracy and fidelity, has a natural claim upon the patronage of that particular place or district, of which it treats. The following may in some degree boast of more extensive pretensions, two considerations making an History of Newcastle upon Tyne of general and national im∣portance: its situation, not far from the borders of Scotland, which rendered it one of the principal frontier towns during the hostilities with the sister kingdom; and, since that unhappy time, its extensive coal trade.</P>
<P>The oldest printed account of that place, is, a small book in quarto, consisting of thirty-four pages, and intitled, "Chorogra∣phia, or a Survey of Newcastle upon Tyne, &amp;c. Newcastle printed by S. B. 1649. S. P. D. dilectis Burgensibus et probis Hominibus Novi Castri super Tinam. W. G."</P>
<P>The last letters stand for the initials of William Grey, of whom I have not been able to recover any particulars. — The Greys of Backworth in Northumberland are said to be of the same family. This work, an imperfect outline, but which is extremely scarce, was reprinted in the Harleian Miscellanies, vol. iii. in 1745, with some additional remarks.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="5"/>Another small quarto volume on the same subject, very rarely to be met with, is intitled, "England's Greivance discovered in relation to the Coal Trade; with the map of the river of Tyne, and situation of the town and corporation of Newcastle, &amp;c. by Ralph Gardiner of Chriton (Chirton) in the county of Northum∣berland, Gent. London, 1655." It is dedicated to the Lord Protector Cromwell, consists of two hundred and eleven pages, and is ornamented with the heads of several kings and queens of England. The author appears to have been a most pointed enemy to the magistrates of Newcastle <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><P>The mayor and corporation of Newcastle upon Tyne, in their answer to the com∣plaint of Ralph Gardiner to the committee appointed for trade, &amp;c. 1653 (a MS. which I have read), expressly say that that writer "broke the goale of Newcastle last summer, being there imprisoned for divers great sums of money, and again imprisoned at the suit of the sheriff of the said town;" and to this they attribute his malicious charge.</P>
<P>The MS. Life of Alderman Barnes, which I shall often have occasion to cite, in a note, p. 420, informs us, that, "upon some methods agreed on for reformation of man∣ners in the town, according to that clause in the charter, which impowers them to make be laws, there was one Gardiner writ a malicious invective against the government of Newcastle; but he got his reward, being afterwards at York hanged for coyning."</P>
<P>Chirton, where he lived, is a village east of Newcastle, near the town of Sheilds. "He was," says Bourne, "a bitter enemy to this town, and did all the mischief to it that lay in his power, as appears in every page of his book, in which are numbers of falsities."</P></NOTE>. From each of these curious tracts I have adopted in the subsequent collections what∣ever I thought worthy of being preserved.</P>
<P>With regard to MS. authorities, I shall constantly refer my readers to the great national repositories—the Heralds' and Aug∣mentation Offices, the British Museum, the Rolls' Chapel, and the Tower of London.</P>
<P>The Bodleian library at Oxford, the public library, and those of Trinity and Bennet Colleges in the university of Cambridge, were open to my inspection.</P>
<P>I found a very copious source of unedited materials in the archives of the corporation of Newcastle upon Tyne <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Permission was granted to me in the most liberal manner by the late John Baker, Esq. alderman of that town, during his last mayoralty, to inspect all the records, with liberty at the same time to make what extracts I thought proper.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="6"/>My honoured patron, the Duke of Northumberland, conde∣scended to allow me the liberty of perusing and extracting what∣ever I found to my purpose from many of the valuable records of his illustrious house.</P>
<P>I was indulged with the free use of a MS. collection, intitled, "An Abstract in order of Time of the Charters and other Records concerning the Town of Newcastle upon Tyne."</P>
<P>It appears to have belonged to some former recorder or town-clerk, but comes no lower down than the fifth year of the reign of King Charles the First.</P>
<P>I cite this under the name of "the Aubone MS." it having belonged to the late Mr. Aubone, secretary to the Trinity-House. A copy of it, taken by Mr. Aubone's permission, is preserved in the library of John Erasmus Blackett, Esq. alderman of New∣castle <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">That gentleman used his utmost endeavours, but without success, to obtain for me a sight of the Milbank MS. so often quoted by Bourne.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I have derived very considerable information from a MS. in folio, which I call "the Murray MS." having received the loan of it from a gentleman <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Mr. George Parker.</NOTE> to whom it was bequeathed by the late Mr. James Murray, attorney at law <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Mr. Murray served his clerkship to Mr. Ord, attorney at law in Newcastle.—He was afterwards in the town-clerk's office.—The MS. devolved to him on the death of Mr. Ord. I have some reasons for thinking that the greatest part of this collection was made by Sir Robert Shaftoe, on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> recorder of Newcastle. Mr. Murray died in 1779. See Inscriptions in St. Andrew's church-yard, in the following work.</NOTE>. It is written in various hands, and evidently at different periods; so that probably it has also been the property of some former recorder or town-clerk.</P>
<P>I was favoured with the perusal of a curious MS. by the pre∣sent possessor, John Medley, Esq. alderman of Newcastle upon Tyne. It is intitled, "A Catalogue of all the Mayors and She∣riffs of his Majesty's Towne and Countye of Newcastle upon Tyne, with their Coats of Armes and the Reignes of the several
<PB N="vi" REF="7"/>
Kinges and Queens of this Land, with certain Briefs of Chronicles that happened in their several Reigns since Anno Domini 1432." I call this throughout the following work "the Carr MS." as it appears to have owed its preservation to one of that family.— The subsequent inscription is stamped in golden letters on the binding: "Robert Carre, Esq. St. Helen Auckland 1730;" with the family arms: viz. gules, on a chevron argent three mullets fable. This is doubtless the identical MS. mentioned by Bourne in page 121 of his History of Newcastle<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><P>In the Introduction to the first volume of the Archaeologia, p. 25, notes, it is said that Mr. Elstob, son of Ralph Elstob, merchant at Newcastle upon Tyne, who was born in 1673, fellow of University College, Oxford, and died rector of the united parishes of St. Swithin and St. Mary Botham in London, 1714, collected for an History of New∣castle; but what is become of the MS. is not known.</P>
<P>For this collection I made every inquiry, but in vain.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>I have occasionally made considerable use of a MS. "Life of Ambrose Barnes, merchant and sometime alderman of New∣castle." It is in folio, closely written, with a dedication to Sir Theodore Talbot. It contains several curious anecdotes; but the writer, whoever he was, appears to have been deeply tinctured both with religious and political fanaticism.</P>
<P>The dedication, signed with the initials M. R. is dated June 19th, 1716.</P>
<P>From Bourne's History of Newcastle upon Tyne, a thin folio volume, which was published three years after the death of the author, A. D. 1736, a circumstance which both apologizes and accounts for the various contradictions with which it abounds, I have selected whatever I thought authentic and interesting to my subject <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot"><P>In the Newcastle Courant for November 20th, 1731, are inserted Mr. Bourne's proposals for publishing this work by subscription: He had advertised for materials in the same Courant for September 18th, 1731.</P>
<P>The posthumous work was advertised ibid. April 24th, 1736, to be delivered to the subscribers on the 3d of May following.</P>
<P>Mr. Bourne, after a very lingering illness, died about four o'clock in the afternoon of February 16th, 1733.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="8"/>George Allan, Esq. F. S. A. of Darlington in the county of Durham, favoured me, in the most liberal and polite manner, with the loan of several volumes of MSS. copied from original records remaining in the church of Durham, and which had been bequeathed to him by the indefatigable transcriber, the Rev. Mr. Randall, late of that city, with liberty of making such ex∣tracts as I should think proper. I cite these passim by the title of "Randall's MSS. <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot"><P>Dr. Hunter of Durham, often mentioned with respect by the learned Mr. Horsley, in his Britannia Romana, transcribed a great number of records, relating to Newcastle upon Tyne, from the archives of the church of Durham, (as I gather from Randall's MSS.) and sold a copy of Bourne's History aforesaid, with these transcripts interleaved, to Mr. Akenhead, bookseller at Newcastle, for five guineas, in 1740. This collection was the ground-work of Mr. Akenhead's engaging in the design to publish an History of Newcastle, for which he gave out proposals, not long after the above purchase. This intended work was, however, never published, nor could I by any means procure a sight of the interleaved copy of Bourne's History; but I have every reason to think that I found transcripts of the same records in Randall's MSS. Mr. Akenhead's proposals for printing by subscription a History of Newcastle upon Tyne in two volumes in quarto, were published in the Newcastle Journal some time in the year 1750.</P></NOTE>"</P>
<P>I selected some very interesting materials from the MS. collec∣tions of the late George Grey, of Newcastle upon Tyne, Esq. barrister at law: all of which, together with his library, had been sold by his executors to Mr. Robert Harrison, formerly of that town, of whom they were purchased (with several notes, extracts, and references to books, concerning the same place, which he himself had made and collected in the course of his very extensive reading), for the use of the following work.</P>
<P>Vicinity and other circumstances once tempted me to hope that, in the course of my progress in it, I should have profited much by his judicious observations; but from the circumstance of his removing to the south of England, and of my leaving the north before his return, my expectations on that head were en∣tirely frustrated.</P>
<P><PB N="viii" REF="9"/>Sir Matthew White Ridley, Bart. governor of the Merchants' Company, indulged me in the politest manner with the liberty of inspecting the records of that society.</P>
<P>Alexander Adams, Esq. steward of the Hostmen's Company, did me a similar favour with respect to those of that fraternity.</P>
<P>I am indebted to John Erasmus Blackett, Esq. for the loan of a curious MS. collection of pedigrees, &amp;c. which formerly be∣longed to the Calverley family, and to their late most respectable representative, Sir Walter Blackett, Bart.</P>
<P>I owe the perusal of Dr. Ellison's MS. collections, with many other attentions, to the kindness of his grandson the Rev. Natha∣niel Ellison, M. A. vicar of Bolam in Northumberland, and lec∣turer of St. Andrew's in Newcastle upon Tyne.</P>
<P>The late George Stephenson, Esq. procured me leave to inspect the old books and other records of the Trinity-House of that town.</P>
<P>Liberty to examine and collect notes from the parish registers was granted me in the most friendly manner by the several clergy and keepers of the registers in Newcastle and Gateshead<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">I must not omit to mention that a collection of neat drawings of monuments, arms, &amp;c. in the several churches of Newcastle, was purchased of Mr. Lambert, formerly clerk to the recorder of Newcastle, for the use of this work; and had the copies of the inscrip∣tions on the monuments been as accurate as they ought to have been, they would have anticipated a great deal of my most ungrateful labour.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I owe acknowledgments for permission to inspect several antient MSS. curious deeds, &amp;c. to Thomas Astle, Esq. F. R. S. and S. A. keeper of the records in the Tower of London; to John Topham, Esq. F. R. S. and S. A. of the State Paper Office; to Craven Ord, Esq. F. R. S. and S. A. of the Exchequer; to John Caley, Esq. keeper of the records in the Augmentation Office.</P>
<P>For various communications in the course of the following work, I stand indebted to Charles Coombe, M. D. F. R. S. and S. A.; to the Rev. Mr. Penneck, F. R. S.; the Rev. Mr.
<PB N="ix" REF="10"/>
Southcote, and the Rev. Mr. Ascough, of the British Museum; to Mrs Adair, formerly Miss Shaftoe, of Benwell Lodge, in the county of Northumberland; to Hugh Hornby, Esq. alder∣man of Newcastle upon Tyne; to John Davidson, Esq. clerk of the peace for the county of Northumberland; to Nathaniel Clayton, Esq. town-clerk, and Nathaniel Punshon, Esq. under-sheriff of Newcastle; to Jonathan Airey, Esq. to Thomas Davidson, Esq. to Jasper Harrison, Esq. to Mr. George Anderson, architect; to the late Mr. Davison, and to Mr. Rutter, attorneys at law in Newcastle; to Robert Page, Esq. deputy comptroller of the Custom-House of that place; to Mr. Ralph Beilby, and Mr. Richard Fisher, of the same town.</P>
<P>To the several stewards of the incorporated companies of Newcastle, I was obliged for the liberty of searching in their respective archives for their ordinaries and other antient writings<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot"><P>I shall just barely mention, that the late Rev. Mr. James Murray, a dissenting minister in Newcastle, undertook, some time before his death, to compile a history of that town; but, having no means of procuring any other information on the subject than was to be obtained from printed books, his design came to nothing.</P>
<P>From motives of delicacy I contented myself with this account of his MS. from those who perused it, declining, for very obvious reason, to read a line of it myself.</P>
<P>There is a brief history of Newcastle included in Wallis's History of Northumberland, and in Hutchinson's View of the same county.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>After pleading, in excuse for the rough and unpolished style of the following collections, the rudeness of my materials, deduced from the records of barbarous ages, corrupted in many places by the ignorance and inattention of former tran∣scribers, I shall conclude in the language of the learned pre∣late, Dr. White Kennet:</P>
<P>"If the present age be too much immersed in pleasures to take any relish, or to make any use of these discoveries, I then appeal to posterity: for I believe the times will come,
<PB N="x" REF="11"/>
when persons of better inclination will arise, who will be glad to find any collections of this nature, and to supply the defects and carry on the continuation of it.—I am under no concern to vindicate it from the slights and ridicule that may be cast upon it by idle, witty (his Lordship might have added, ignorant) people, who think all history to be scraps, and all antiquity to be rust and rubbish." Or in that of the great Camden, in the preface to the Latin edition of his Britannia:</P>
<P>"Si qui sint, qui in urbe sua hospites, in patria sua pere∣grini, et cognitione semper pueri esse velint, sibi per me pla∣ceant, sibi dormiant, non ego illis haec conscripsi, non illis vigilavi."</P>

<HEAD>HISTORY OF NEWCASTLE UPON TYNE.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>ANCIENT FORTIFICATIONS, STREETS <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The oldest <HI>Plan</HI> I have seen of Newcastle is that in Speed's Map of Northumber∣land. See a fac-simile copy of this in a corner of the new plan that accompanies this work. It was described by William Mathew, who is mentioned in an inquisition 18th James I. in the account of the castle, about the year 1610.</P>
<P>A. D. 1723, a Plan of Newcastle upon Tyne, dedicated to Matthew Featherstone∣haugh, mayor, the aldermen, sheriff, and common council of that town, was published in two sheets, with twenty-six views of publick buildings, by James Corbridge.</P>
<P>The plan prefixed to Bourne's History, published in 1736, is without any engraver's name, and seems only a copy of the above, with additions and improvements.</P>
<P>Gough, in his British Topography, Vol. II. p. 57, tells us, he was informed, that "a very correct plan (of Newcastle) was taken soon after the rebellion, by order, and at the expence, of the late Duke of Cumberland, and is now in the hands of Mr. Thompson, who drew it." I inquired of Mr. Thompson's son, but could neither learn of him whether ever such a plan had been taken, nor into whose hands it had fallen.</P>
<P>A most correct plan of Newcastle upon Tyne, and Gateshead, taken from an actual survey, finished in the year 1770, engraved in two sheets by J. Ellis, was published by Charles Hutton, mathematician.</P>
<P>Thoresby, in his Ducatus Leodensis, p. 497, mentions a <HI>Prospect</HI> he had of Newcastle, drawn by Mr. William Lodge, of Leeds, who was born in 1649, and died 1689.</P>
<P>A south prospect of the town of Newcastle upon Tyne, taken from the top of Gateshead-Church-steeple, by Samuel Buck, was engraved and published in the month of April, 1724.</P>
<P>A large north-east view of Newcastle was published by Samuel and Nathaniel Buck, 1715.</P>
<P>Grey, in his Chorographia, p. 27, tells us, that Camden makes Newcastle upon Tyne 22 grad. 30 min. longitude—54 grad. 57 min. latitude: and that Hues makes it 23 grad. 10 min. longitude—55 grad. 20 min. latitude.</P>
<P>According to Dr. Hutton's plan, it stands precisely in 55 degrees of north latitude, and about 1° 17′ longitude west from London.</P></NOTE>, CHURCHES, MONASTERIES, BRIDGES, AND OTHER PUBLICK EDIFICES, IN NEWCASTLE UPON TYNE.</HEAD>
<P>HARDYNG, in his Chronicle, informs us that Newcastle upon Tyne was inclosed with a wall during the reign of William Rufus <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><P>See History of Newcastle, as a borough town, under that reign: His words are;
<Q><L>"The towne to builde, and walle as did append,</L>
<L>He gave theim ground and golde ful great to spend,</L>
<L><HI>To builde it well, and wall it all aboute, &amp;c.</HI>"</L></Q>
That part of the wall near St. Andrew's-Church, which is of a more antique fashion than the rest, may perhaps be a specimen of the earliest and original walls of Newcastle—it extends from New-Gate to Ever-Tower.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="21"/>In a charter of King John to that town, dated January 28th, 1216, express mention occurs of the walls thereof<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">See History of the Merchants Adventurers.—The words are; "Et quod nullus eorum qui fuerit infra gildam suam mercatoriam placitet extra muros Novi Castri."</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In a grant from the King to the Black-Friars of Newcastle, dated Sept. 18th, 1280, the west part of the present wall of that town, near the house of that order, is called the New-Wall <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><P>To have a passage into their garden.—The words are; "Quod per medium novum murum circumagentem villam predictam, quem per medium gardini predictorum fratrum fieri oportebit, &amp;c." See afterwards in the account of that house. The wall appears to have been finished a year or two afterwards, by the subsequent extract from the Aubone MS. "A. D. 1283, 11th Ed. I. Upon a writ of ad quod damnum, inquiry was made before the mayor and bailiffs of Newcastle, whether there were, between the town-wall and the house of the friars preachers there, a place called the King's-Place. And it was found that there was such a place, purchased the last year of the issues and profits of the murage, upon part of which the wall was built, and part left for necessary carriages unto it, which is called the void place, and is necessary for the defence thereof."</P>
<P>Among the writings preserved in the hutch, or common treasury of Newcastle, A. D. 1565, was one intitled, "A grant for building the walls of the town." The original is now lost, and the date has not been transmitted.</P></NOTE>.</P>

Hereupon he was raunsomed for a great sum, and returning home he beganne to make a waulle on the ripe of Tyne ryver, from Sand-Hille to Pandon-Gate, and beyond that to the tower agayne the Augustine-Freres."—He afterwards says, the walls were not en∣tirely finished till Edward the Third's time.—Indeed he speaks merely from the report of others, who plainly appear to have known nothing of the matter.—He adds, "The strength and magnificens of the waulling of this towne far passith al the waulles of the cities of England, and most of the townes of Europe."</P>
<P>The following I extracted from a MS. in the Cotton Library. Julius, F. 10.— "Edwardo primo regnante civis Novocastrensis vir opulentissimus ex ipso oppido in Scotiam abductus fuit, qui demum pretio redemptus Novocastr' muro primus circumdare coepit, quod reliqui cives imitati, Edwardo Tertio regnante, firmissimo muro circumdedit."</P></NOTE> of Newcastle, on the side towards the east, occurs <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">A grant to the Carmelites to remove from Wallknoll to another site:—"Eo quod murus ejusdem villae de novo constructus per medium clausi ipsorum, &amp;c."

<P>Mention occurs, ibid. March 7th, 1648, of a "Committee about the repayringe of the towne wall att the Friars (probably the White-Friars, near which a great breach was made at the storming of the town), being 56 or 57 yards." There is also, ibid. September 20th, 1647, an order for repayring the towne wall—urged by Colonel Lilburne, the Go∣vernor of Newcastle—especially a breach near a place called "The Pink-Tower," in length 55 yards, about 3 yards thick, and 6 yards and an half high.</P></NOTE>.</P>

<P>November 17th, 1762, the corporation of Newcastle upon Tyne, on their petition, stating, that that part of the town-wall, which ex∣tended from the Sand-Hill to Sand-Gate, was no longer of any use for defence, but a great obstruction to carriages and hindrance to the dis∣patch of business, obtained an order of the privy council to remove it at their own expence <NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot"><LETTER>

<HEAD>FOSS.</HEAD>
<P>THE Foss or Ditch, that has anciently surrounded the walls of Newcastle, is, in most places at present, filled up, and made level with the adjoining ground. The space, however, which it occupied, is still called "The King's-Dikes." It appears to have been uniformly of the breadth of twenty-two yards, or a chain. It is claimed as the pro∣perty of the corporation, to whom every waste within their jurisdiction devolves, by the authority of their charter. It occurs, A. D. 1312, by the name of "novum fossatum." See account of Black-Friars.</P>
<P>The subsequent entry occurs in the common council books, Sept. 28th, 1648. "Ordered, upon the petition of James Turner, shewe∣ing, that whereas he farmed the Kinge's-Dikes of the towne, and was to paie about 30 and odd shillings rent for the same—By reason of the trenches it became a common road for man and horse, and especially for the townes kie, so that he could make no benefit by it, &amp;c."</P>
<P>As does the following: "February, 1654. The ground called the King's-Dikes, leadinge from Sand-Gate towards Wallknole-Tower, ordered "to be canted," <HI>i. e.</HI> let to the highest bidder, with the Wall∣knole-Close—as likewise the dikes from Pandon to Sand-Gate."</P>

<P>THE town, says Bourne, after the completing of the walls, was divided into twenty-four wards <NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot"><P>These appear to have been, 1. Close-Gate.—2. White-Friar-Tower.—3.

From the Close-Gate there are an hundred and forty steps, on the top of the wall, as it mounts a very steep hill to White-Friar-Tower, at the distance of sixty-nine yards and one foot.—The common name of these, <HI>i. e.</HI> the Break-Neck-Stairs, is of very obvious etymology.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="28"/>White-Friar-Tower was so called from the adjoining house of the Carmelites, or White-Friars.

<P>There is an order of common council, September 23d, 1776, for a lease of the White-Fryer-Tower to Isaac Cookson, Esq. for twenty-one years, under the annual rent of one shilling, with liberty to make a battlement and way from his summer-house to the top of the said tower, &amp;c. He has converted it into an ice-house.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The distance from White-Friar-Tower to Postern-Gate, which adjoins on Denton, or Nevil-Tower, is two hundred and fourteen yards and two feet.</P>
<P>Denton, or Nevil-Tower <NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot"><P>"Denton-Tower, otherwise called Nevel-Tower," our MS. continues, "that stands by north a Yate called White-Freer-Yate, nowe mured up with stones, shall have to ward all the Haire-Hugh behinde the White-Freers, with all the howses standing there upon the Burn-Banck, betwixt the Freer-Kirk and a Burne, unto a stone brigge in Baly-Gate, with all Baly-Gate upwarde that same rawe unto Denton-Chare, but nothing of Galou-Gate."</P>
<P>John de Denton was a bailiff of Newcastle in 1339. This tower may probably have been built by him, or some of his family, who might also have had great property in the lane called Denton-Chare.</P>
<P>Ralph Nevil, Lord of Raby, was created Earl of Westmoreland, in the 21st year of the reign of Richard the Second.</P>
<P>This is at present the hall of the company of wallers, bricklayers and plaisterers.—See account of that society.</P></NOTE>, probably derives the first of these appel∣lations, from the same person that gave a name to the lane called Denton-Chare—As it undoubtedly does the second from the Nevil family, whose town-house, called Westmoreland-Place, stood near, and is said to have communicated with it by a subterraneous passage.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="29"/>From the Postern-Gate <NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot"><P>On the wall over the Postern-Gate is the following inscription: "The walls were repaired and fortified for the defence of this town against the rebels, A. D. 1745; Cuthbert Smith, Esquire, Mayor, Henry Partis, Esq. Sheriff."</P>
<P>Bourne supposes this postern in the wall to have been an outlet to the (White) Friars, that they might walk to the Forth and the neighbouring fields, and that it might be of use to the castle in times of hostility with the Scots. He imagines also this to have been the gate out at which the townsmen in the reign of Edward III. to the number of three hun∣dred valiant men, issued, and came suddenly, in the night, upon a great army of the Scots, which lay in the west part of the town; and raised and put them to flight, taking Earl Murray prisoner in his tent, &amp;c. See Historical Events. Over this gate, towards the town, are the following arms, cut in stone: Quarterly a Bend; Clavering—On a Bend three mullets; Shaftoe.—Also for the town, three castles.—Persons of the names of Cla∣vering and Shaftoe were mayors and sheriffs here, A. D. 1607—1629—1663.</P>
<P>The following entries concerning this place occur in the common-council books, June 19th, 1753.</P>
<P>"Way through the Postern-Gate to the Firth.—Ordered that Mr. Joshua Douglas be applied to to open the way to the Firth through the Postern-Gate, and the closes contigu∣ous thereto, now in his possession, as it has heretofore been.

<P><PB N="11" REF="32"/>This gate consists of four wards, and is said to have been built by Roger de Thornton, a merchant, who from small beginnings became equally distinguished for his wealth and munificence. This place was formerly a prison for unruly apprentices, and is at present the hall of the company of house-carpenters. A foot way was opened out on the north side of this gate, 1782; "Edward Mosley, Esq. mayor, George Collpits, Esq. sheriff<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><P>"West-Yate" proceeds our old MS. "shall have in warde fro that vennell that ledeth into White-Freer-Kirk, so goinge upon the west rawe of West-Gate unto the West-Yate, with all that dwelleth without that yate. Also fro' the west ende of Denton-Chare, so goeng upward upon the est rawe of West-Gate, unto the West-Yate, with those that dwell in Sainct John Kirk-Yard, and with all that dwell fro the said Kirk unto the West-Yate."</P>
<P>Roger de Thornton is said to have come originally from the country west of Newcastle, according to the old saying, which Bourne gives as follows:
<Q><L>"At the West-Gate came Thornton in,</L>
<L>With a hap and a halfpenny and a lambskin."</L></Q></P>
<P>In Stow's transcript of Leland's Itinerary, it is somewhat different;
<Q><L>"In at the West-Gate came Thornton in,</L>
<L>With a happen hapt in a ram's skynn.</L></Q></P>
<P>He adds, "This Roger Thornton was the richest marchant that ever was dwelling in Newcastell. The isle and almost all the landes that the Lord Lomely hath in Yorkshire and Northumbreland were this Thornton's". (Vol. v. p. 114.)</P>
<P>Lord Lumley married his daughter.—There is a tradition in the family that the de∣scendants of this great benefactor to the town were exempted from paying toll at the gates of Newcastle.</P>
<P>Mention occurs of West-Gate used for a prison, in the following extract from Rush∣worth's Collections, Part IV. vol. ii. p. 1219.—"On Monday night last, in the time of the storm, all that were in West-Gate in the town of Newcastle, to the number of seventeen, of the prisoners lately taken in Northumberland, escaped away. Having had friends come to visit them several times, divers ropes were brought in to them, which was not known till they were gone: In the dark of the night, when the storm was violent, blew hard, and much rain, by the ropes let themselves down by a privy."</P>
<P>This happened about the beginning of August 1648.—It appears that six of the chief of the prisoners that were in Tinmouth-Castle escaped at the same time, letting themselves down through a privy, built on the north side of the Castle, with sheets sewed together.</P></NOTE>."</P>
<P>Leland calls this gate "a mightye strong thinge of four wardes and an yron gate."</P>

<P>This is at present the hall of the glaziers, plumbers, pewterers and painters, who repaired it A. D. 1700. It appears to have been granted to them in 1619<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">A gilded ball hangs suspended from the center of this meeting room: it probably had been shot from the cannon of the Scottish army during the great siege of the town in 1644; and having lodged in the wall, was discovered on the alteration of the tower. It is curi∣ous to observe hereabouts on the outside of the wall, how many of the stones still bear the marks of the above very memorable siege.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Between Herber and Mordon-Tower there has been a postern in the wall.—See the account of the Monastery of Black-Friars.</P>

In an original deed dated at Newcastle upon Tyne, Tuesday before the feast of St. Hillary, 1354, "Cockstole Bothes" occur with the appellation of "les Coksour Bothes."

<P>Grey, who wrote his Chorographia in 1649, speaking of the towers of the Roman-Wall, says: "One of these towers remaineth whole in the towne-wall of Newcastle, in Pampden, older than the rest of the towers, and after another fashion, standing out of the wall."</P></NOTE>, or the Carpenters' Tower, it measures ninety-five yards and one foot.</P>

His account proceeds as follows: "From Sand-Gate to Close Gate—From Sand-Gate to the Broad-Chare, 143 yards 2 feet.—From the Broad-Chair to Trinity-Chair, 68 yards.—From Trinity-Chair to Sand-Hill-Corner, 198 yards.—From Sand-Hill-Corner to the Bridge-End, 132 yards.—From the Bridge-End to the Mayor's House, 252 yards.—And from the Mayor's House to the Close-Gate, 117 yards and 2 feet,—making the circumference, in all, two miles, two hundred and ninety-three yards, and two feet.</P>
<P>Bourne makes the whole circumference two miles and an hundred and seventy-six yards.</P>
<P>According to Hutton's plan, the circuit of the wall now standing, from the Close-Gate to Sand-Gate, is 2740 yards, or one mile and an half, and an hundred yards.</P>
<P>A passage, leading from the Sand-Hill to the Key-Side, still retains the name of the Water-Gate.—Mention of it occurs in the common-council books, August 24th, 1649, where it is called "the Windowes-Gate."

<P>Hutton's plan makes the number of houses in that town two thou∣sand four hundred and fifty, and in Gateshead five hundred and fifty <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot"><P>Hutton supposes Newcastle and Gateshead to contain not less than thirty thousand in∣habitants.

The market days for corn are Tuesdays and Saturdays."</P>
<P>The subsequent extract from the Newcastle Courant informs us how late that town was in adopting the great convenience of having nightly lamps in the streets:</P>
<P>"October 1st, 1763. Thursday night the lamps put up in the streets of this town were lighted up for the first time."—This was in consequence of an act lately passed for lighting the streets, and other places, and maintaining a regular and nightly watch within the town and county of the town of Newcastle upon Tyne, and for regulating the hack∣ney coachmen and chairmen, cartmen, porters and watermen within the same.</P>
<P>A proposal was made and published, A. D. 1755, for illuminating the streets of that town with 150 lamps.</P>
<P>Dr. Stukeley, in his Itinerary, speaking of the inhabitants of Newcastle upon Tyne, observes: "They speak very broad; so that, as one walks the streets, one can scarce un∣derstand the common people, but are apt to fancy oneself in a foreign country."</P>

<HEAD>TYNE-BRIDGE.</HEAD>
<P>THE proofs that a Roman bridge <NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot"><P>Bourne tells us, "The bridge is of great antiquity, undoubtedly as old as the times of the Romans: there must have been a communication between this and the other side of the river, and therefore there was a necessity for it."—The ingenious Mr. Horsley, p. 104, says, "I think there are some certain and visible remains of a military way on Gateshead-Fell, pointing directly towards the part where, I suppose, the station has been at New∣castle, and coming, as I apprehend, from Chester-le-Street. Dr. Hunter assured me he had also observed visible remains of such a way. And it is the common opinion that there has been a military way from Chester-le-Street to Newcastle. This way tends towards the place where the bridge now is. There must then have been a bridge in the Roman times over the river Tyne, near the place where the present bridge stands." Thus far from Bourne.—Horsley's words are, p. 399, Romana Britannia—"That Dr. Hunter in∣formed him, that "he had observed a military way going off from Watling-Street, near Binchester, which he (Dr. H.) supposed went to Chester-on-the-Street, between Durham and Newcastle; he traced it to Branspeth-Park, but could find it no farther." He adds, p. 391, "That the name of Chester-on-the-Street does not a little confirm the opinion, that there has been a Roman settlement there of some kind or other, and that a military way has passed from Newcastle to it."—He adds farther on this subject, p. 451, "The gardener at Cousins'-House told me, that he had observed, when he wrought thereabouts, the military way from Newcastle to Chester-le-street, and that it lay to the west of the pre∣sent highway, through the Fell. And Dr. Hunter was positive that he had observed the same way upon this Fell: as also some remaining tracks of a via vicinalis beyond Chester, between Binchester and Brancepeth-Castle (as I remember) pointing towards Chester, which he therefore concluded must have gone that way."</P>
<P>Dr. Stukeley, in his Iter Boreale, p. 69, speaking of Gateshead, says, "The Roman road here, which is the true Hermen-Street, coming from Suffex, coming down Gates∣head-Fell, passes in a strait line to the bridge."</P></NOTE> occupied either the same, or nearly the same site with the present bridge at Newcastle, appear
<PB N="36" REF="61"/>
stronger than those generally are which are brought in confirmation of truths of such remote antiquity.</P>
<P>Two eminent antiquaries <NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Mr. Horsley, author of the Britannia Romana, and Dr. Hunter, of Durham.</NOTE> of this country, to one of whom we owe the greatest part of our intelligence concerning Roman Britain, were persuaded, from visible remains existing in their time, that there was a Roman road from Binchester, through Chester-in-the-Street, to the site of the present Newcastle upon Tyne.</P>
<P>An ancient Itinerary, discovered since they wrote, seems to confirm their account beyond the possibility of a doubt <NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot"><P>The Itinerary of Richard of Cirencester, discovered and first printed by Mr. Bertram in Sweden. We trace, on the ancient map, delineated in this very valuable acquisition to English antiquartes, the Roman great road, leading straight from Cataract, in York∣shire, to Binchester, in the county of Durham, where it branches out into two different iters, one of which stretches towards Falkirk, in Scotland, by way of Ebchester, Cor∣bridge, &amp;c. while the other, passing through Chester-in-the-Street, terminates at the Roman wall at Newcastle upon Tyne.</P>
<P>At Corbridge the remains of a Roman bridge are still visible.</P>
<P>The very high antiquity of this Itinerary is said, by Dr. Stukeley, to be marked out by such names as "ad Murum—ad Tesam—ad Alaunam—ad Tuedam," &amp;c. shewing that the roads were generally made or marked out, but that towns, cities, and castles were not then built, only some inns for present conveniency.—He adds, that we may reasonably judge from hence, that the original Itinerary and Map, which this Richard of Cirencester copied, was constructed in Agricola's time—though afterwards additions were made to it. Some have supposed that there was one of those inns at Gateshead, called, at that time, from the sign of a goat's head, "Caprae Caput."—But see account of "Gateshead."</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="62"/>The Emperor Aelius Hadrian, who connected the forts erected by Agricola, by raising the great vallum, that in this part of the island extended nearly from sea to sea, was probably the first that built a bridge at this place; from which circumstance, the station it led to from the Roman road was afterwards called "Pons Aelii," an appellation plainly derived, as were those of others of his publick works, from the name of his own family <NOTE N="v" PLACE="foot"><P>"Thus," says Pennant, "Jerusalem was styled Aelia Capitolina," and the games he instituted at Pincum in Maesia, "Aeliana Pincensia." It may be added, that the bridge which Hadrian throw over the Tyber at Rome, is called to this hour "Ponte Elio Adri∣ano." See Piranesi's Views.</P>
<P>Two coins appear to have been struck upon the building of two bridges by this Em∣peror: one is doubtless to be referred to that at Rome: may not the other have been in∣tended to commemorate the work we are now considering? One of the bridges marked on these coins has seven, the other five arches. The Tyber being a very inconsiderable river, when compared with the Tyne, we must therefore claim that with seven arches— especially as we find a view of the Pons Aelius at Rome in Piranesi's Collection, without the modern ornaments, where it is represented as consisting of exactly five arches. See Vaillant, tom. i. p. 68, where, speaking of the coins of Hadrian, he thus describes one of them: "Sine epigraphe Pons Aelius cum septem fornicibus sub eo plurimae figurae;"— and the other, p. 194, as follows: "Sine epigraphe Pons Aelius cum quinque forni∣cibus."—(Edition of Paris, 1692, quarto.)</P>
<P>See also "Numismatum Antiquorum in Musaeo Pembrochiano Sylloges, pars 3."</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>Many Roman coins <NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot"><P>"I cannot help thinking," says Pennant, Tour, vol. iii. p. 313, "that part of the Roman bridge remained there till very lately: for from the observation of workmen upon the old piers, they seem originally to have been formed without any springs for arches. This was a manner of building used by the Romans: witness the bridge built over the Danube by Trajan, at Severin, twenty Hungarian miles from Belgrade, whose piers, I be∣lieve, still exist." Of the coins that were found, Mr. Pennant describes the following:— "Coins, posterior to the time of Adrian, probably deposited there in some later repairs. One is a beautiful Faustina the Elder, after her deification—her forehead is bound with a small tiara—her hair full, twisted and dressed a la moderne—round is inscribed "Diva Faustina." On the reverse is a Ceres, with a torch in one hand, and ears of corn in the other: the inscription "Augusta S. C."</P>
<P>"The next has the laureated head of Antoninus Pius—on the reverse, Apollo, with a patera in one hand, a plectrum in the other—the legend defaced.</P>
<P>"The third is of Lucius Verus, after consecration—reverse, a magnificent funeral pile, and the word "Consecratio, S. C."—The originals of these are in the possession of the Bishop of Durham."</P>
<P>I have one of Trajan found here also—it is the same as that described in Thoresby's Leeds, p. 297, N<SUP>o</SUP> 294,—as also one of Antoninus, of the larger size.</P>

this bridge, after the fall thereof, A. D. 1771, proving, it should seem, that some of the original Roman structure remained here, till every part of the ancient building was cleared away on the erection of the new bridge.</P>
<P>Bourne's reasoning <NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">His words are these: "It has been a query whether the bridge was originally of wood or stone, but I think it is altogether needless: all the bridges in England were ori∣ginally of wood.—In the reign of Richard I. Philip, Bishop of Durham, sent to the bur∣gesses of Gateside a grant of forestage, in which are these words: "And it shall be lawful for every burgess to give wood to whomsoever he will, to be spent about the river of Tyne, without any licence." This, I imagine, has been for the building of keys, and especially for the repairing of the Bishop's part of the bridge, which is a further proof that the bridge, which was the original one, was wood." See afterwards under "Gates∣head"</NOTE> on the Bishop of Durham's charter to the bur∣gesses of Gateshead, in the reign of Richard I. is founded on an error in translating the passage he selected from the original Latin:—The clause, which he has either found wrong or made so, ought to be ren∣dered as follows: "Any burgess (<HI>i. e.</HI> of Gateshead) may give his wood to whom he pleases, provided they live on this side of the Tyne," that is, on the Durham side of that river.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="64"/>In a charter of King Henry II. to the town of Newcastle, cited in one of King John, the existence of a bridge here, at that period, is implied in his exempting the burgesses from the duty of <HI>pontage</HI> for their own goods <NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">See, under that reign, "History of Newcastle as a corporate town."</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In the year 1248, the greatest part of the town of Newcastle upon Tyne, together with the bridge there, was destroyed by fire <NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">"In Anglia etsi de aliis sileamus, maxima pars burgi qui Novum Castrum super Thi∣nam appellatur, cum ponte, igne quasi suriosa consumpta est." <BIBL>Matth.

<P>Bourne tells us, without subjoining on what authority, that after this event the town of Newcastle joined with the Bishop of Durham in erecting a bridge of stone <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">From his Liber Cartarum.—Laurentius was then the master of the bridge.—The archdeacon of Northumberland wrote to the clergy of his archdeaconry, and desired them to assist the work of the bridge, inforcing the command of the Bishop of Durham to set about the affair of indulgencies, preferring the episcopal ones to others.—In like manner the official of Carlisle promised an indulgence of ten days to any one that would assist the repairing of Tyne Bridge.</NOTE>, and that the business was effected by a method common at that time, <HI>i. e.</HI> by sending indulgencies to all per∣sons who would assist them, either with money or labour, to rebuild it.

As also a moiety of Tyne Bridge, on their soil, till the first of May, 1383, when William Bishopdale, mayor of Newcastle, and the commonalty of that town, began to build a tower on the bishop's part of the bridge at Gateshead, and removed, and carried into Newcastle, two stones, called St. Cuthbert's Stones, the ancient boundaries of the liberty aforesaid, and which tower they occupied at that time. The mayor and burgesses of Newcastle, in vindica∣tion of their proceedings, pretended they had authority for so doing, in a charter, dated February 5th, in the 15th year of King John.—The corporation of Newcastle, it is need∣less to add, were cast in this trial, compelled to take back and replace St. Cuthbert's Stones, and give up the tower they had built, together with their claim to the Bishop's right to a third part of this bridge, of which seizin was made for the said bishop as above, January 28th, 1416.—(From a record in the archives of the corporation of Newcastle upon Tyne: see also Wharton's Anglia Sacra, p. 776.)</P>

<P>In Grey's Chorographia, M. Anderson is styled an alderman, and the fish called a salmon, which, some say, is incapable of swallowing any thing so large as a ring. See a story similar to this in Herodotus, lib. iii. c. 41.—In Littlebury's translation of that work, it is in vol. i. p. 272.</P>
<P>There is another of the same kind related in the English Morery, or Collier's Diction∣ary, in verbo "Kentigern."</P>
<P>Fuller, in his Worthies, takes notice of this event, referring, in the margin, to the Vox Piscis.</P>
<P>Bourne tells us, p. 132, "This gentleman, from whose finger the ring fell, was mayor of Newcastle, and was ancestor of the present Mr. Abraham Anderson, merchant, on the Sand-Hill: the said Francis Anderson made over his estate to his son, Henry Anderson, who was the father of the said Abraham's grandfather." He adds, "On the inside of the ring, just under the signet, is the picture of a salmon, in commemoration of the fish and the transaction; on the one side of which is the letter F. and on the other, the letter A. in commemoration of the person," calling it, at the same time, "A curiosity so great, that not only the whole kingdom cannot shew the like of it, but the whole world beside."</P>
<P>This ring is at present, A. D. 1783, in the possession of Mr. Edward Anderson, mer∣chant, who permitted me to take a drawing of it, with an impression on wax of the sig∣net, the engraving on which appears to me to be a Roman antique, though Bourne says, it represents Solomon and the Queen of Sheba.—This Mr. Edward Anderson is a de∣scendant of the person to whom the accident happened, and has a deed of family property, the seal of which exhibits an impression of the signet of this memorable ring, and i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of a date prior to the supposed date of this most extraordinary, but by no means incredible event.

<P>In a deed, preserved in the archives of Newcastle upon Tyne, dated November 20th, 1616, a tenement here is mentioned, "as knowne by the name of the Ladies Chapell." This i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> plainly a corruption of "our Lady's Chapel." and evinces, that there was a chapel on Tyne-Bridge in the Popish times, dedicated to the Virgin Mary <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><P>It was on the east side of the pier, next on the south to that whereon the tower of the bridge stood. "In this tower," says Bourne, "are kept lewd and disorderly persons, till they are examined by the mayor, and brought to due punishment, except the crime be of a very gross nature, and then are removed to New-Gate, and there continued till the assizes." There was a stone, with the town's arms on it, placed on the south front of this tower, with the motto, "F Fortiter defendit triumphans, 1646." It is at present built up in the garden wall of Hugh Hornby, Esq. alderman.</P>
<P>In the MS. Life of Alderman Barnes, p. 73, is given a ludicrous account of one Harry Wallis, a master shipwright, who was so abusive to the said Alderman B. that he committed him to the tower on the bridge, where being enraged at the stone doublet, which his rudeness had got him, and finding a quantity of malt lying in the chamber, where he was lodged, the chamber standing over the Tyne, he threw it out of the win∣dow, with a shovel, into the water, and made the following verses on the occasion, with such wit as his ale had inspired him with:
<Q><L>"O base mault,</L>
<L>Thou didst the fault,</L>
<L>And into Tyne thou shalt."</L></Q>
There is thought to have been, anciently, a chapel in this tower also, for on taking it down, after the fall of the bridge in 1771, a stone coffin and a skeleton were found in it: see Newcastle Courant, for July 8th, 1775. On the north side of this tower there was cut, rudely, in stone, on a shield, a Holy Lamb, passant. Arms attributed by Nesbit, in his Heraldry, to some northern bishop.</P></NOTE>.</P>

<P>On the Saturday night preceding the 17th of November, 1771, a great land stood, occasioned by the fall of heavy rains in the west, happened in the river Tyne, causing it to overflow its banks, and every where marking its progress with the most dreadful devastation. At Newcastle upon Tyne, the water began to rise about eleven o'clock at night, and continued increasing in height till seven the next morn∣ing: about three o'clock, the arches of this bridge were filled up, and between three and four, two of them on the south side were driven down, as was the north arch, adjoining to the toll shop, about five o'clock, burying the houses erected thereon, together with several of their inhabitants, in the ruins <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot"><P>The water rose six feet higher than in the fresh which came down in the river Tyne in 1763.

<P>November 20th, 1771, an order was published by the magistrates of Newcastle upon Tyne, in consequence of a survey of the ruins of Tyne Bridge, to prevent the passage of keels, boats, &amp;c. through any other of the arches, but the four that remained on the north side of the river.</P>
<P>"The arches of the old bridge," says Hutton, in his Plan of Newcastle, dated January 10th, 1772, "were of different figures; some of them resembling Gothic ones, and others scheme arches; nor did the arches decrease regularly from the middle to the ends, and the exceeding narrowness of the passage over it, which was still more contracted by the houses built upon it, rendered it exceedingly inconvenient."</P></NOTE>.</P>

<P>The words above, "super terram meam fundavi," seem plainly to infer that he raised the structure from the ground, although Bourne, on the authority of the MS. he so often cites, and which he calls "Liber Cartarum," styles Aselack the second founder. Having found in Cambden's Britannia, a Lord Walter de Bolbeck conveying lands to the church of Winchester, A. D. 1135, and one of the same name among the first benefactors to this place, he thinks them one and the same person, adding, that "it is a strong reason that this hospital was founded in King Henry I.'s reign."

<P>Randal observes upon this: "There seems to be a sort of contradiction as to the dates of the two last instruments, and also of the subject matter thereof: for Raymes was insti∣tuted to the mastership, April 25th, 1558, and was not deprived till May 1579; and if Richard Master was appointed warden as above, in 1564, it was most certainly whilst Raymes was master, which is inconsistent, not only to have two masters or wardens at the same time, but because Raymes held the wardenship for above fourteen years after this institution of Master bears date; and likewise, because Anthony Garforthe is said to be Raymes's successor in the instrument by which he was appointed on Raymes's depri∣vation.</P>

Bourne says, it was the vestry— but he is plainly mistaken, for the vestry projected to the south—it is now a cellar.—It communicated, in his time, by a door with the chancel.—The grand eastern window, now entirely built up, contained in its painted, or stained glass, an image of the Virgin Mary, with her child on her knees.—In this window, also, Sir George Selby, who was mayor in 1600, put up his own arms, and made, as our author adds, "a traverse over it, and sent to London for twenty-four chairs of mustinie leather (quaere), and there is the election, though the mayor lays down his staff in the old school"—<HI>i. e.</HI> in the place which is now the writing school, and was formerly the grammar school, before the present one was fitted up. To do this, it appears they have pulled down the side aisles of the hos∣pital church, and inclosed the middle aisle by a wall on each side, under the arches.— There has been a large window, now built up also, at the west end. This was plainly discovered at the opening out of one of these arches, on making a new entrance to this place, A. D. 1782.</P>
<P>The present wood floor of the school covers the pavement of the old chapel or church, which consisted of Dutch tiles, of different colours, disposed lozenge-wise.

He gave a very convincing proof of his zeal for protestantism, for on the death of his father, when Ferdinando the Second banished the protestants from his dominions, rather than conform to the errors of popery, he gave up his estate to his younger brother, on condition that he should be furnished with money to travel. On this he came to England, and settled at Oxford, from whence, on the breaking out of the re∣bellion, he went to the Hague, Leyden, and Amsterdam. In the year 1643, he travelled into Denmark, and after passing a year at Copenhagen, and So<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a, visited Dantzick, in Poland, and from thence returned to England; where, after passing some time in London, he came again to Oxford, settling in Kettle-Hall, a member of Trinity College, where he became a severe and constant student in the Bodleian library. After he had left the uni∣versity (where he wrote and published a book, but where it appears he took no degree) he became head master of the grammar school at Newcastle, whence, after many years, he was removed to the church of Hexham, where he was both minister and lecturer; prefer∣ments which he enjoyed almost twenty-eight years. This learned and great man, who in his travels had been tutor to the sons of the Prince of Transylvania, died December 28th, 1683, and lies buried in the chancel of the church of Hexham, to the vicarage of which his son George Ritschel, of Edmund Hall, succeeded. Major Allgood, rector of Simonbourne, preached his funeral sermon, which he printed, with an elegy at the end, London, 1684. In the choir of Hexham church, near the reading desk, on a blue marble flat stone, is the subsequent inscription:

This was reprinted at Frankfort, in 1680, under the in∣spection of Magnus Hesenthalerus, the famous professor of Wirtemberg. He wrote also another book, entitled "Dissertatio de Ceremoniis Ecclesiae Anglicanae, quà Usus earum licitus ostenditur, et a Superstitionis &amp; Idolatriae Crimine vindicatur, Authore Georgio Ritschel, Hexhamiae in Northumbriae Comitatu Ministro." This gained him great credit with his diocesan, Doctor Jo. Cosin, is commended by Dr. Durell in his S. Ecclesiae An∣glicanae Vindiciae, and is taken notice of by Bishop Kennet, in his Historical Register. Afterwards, at the request of the Wirtemberg Professor before named, he sent over thither, in MS. two volumes, entitled, "Ethica Christiana," quarto; and another volume, quarto, styled, "Exercitationes Sacrae," in order to be printed, but it does not appear that they ever saw the light. At his death, also, he left with his son two manuscripts, ready for the press; one, de Fide Catholica, and the other, against the English quakers, both in Latin, quarto, which seem also to have been suppressed.—See Athenae Oxonien. vol. ii. p. 754.</P></NOTE>.</P>

<P>The parsonage, or vicarage house of Newcastle, is situated in this street, not far from St. John's Church <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">There was a hall in it in Bourne's time, very grand and stately, as he tells us, ac∣cording to the hospitality of the times it was built in. There is an order of common-council, dated September 24, 1649, "to save harmlesse Dr. Robert Jennison from dilapi∣dations concerning the vicarage-house," which appears to have been almost entirely de∣stroyed by the Scots, soon after the taking of the town in 1644. This house was repaired and enlarged, A. D. 1694. An elegant great room was fitted up in it by the late Dr. Brown. The Roman wall is said to have passed through the garden of this house.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>There was a building in this street, called Spital-Alms-House: it stood nearly opposite to St. John's Church.—It is mentioned by Bourne, and marked in his plan of the town. It was pulled down not many years ago, and a handsome house erected on the site.</P>

<P>Bourne says, that it appears to have been built, A. D. 1287 <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">In a charter, 15 Ed. I. "Venellum quo itur ad ecclesiam Sancti Johannis."</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Great alterations were probably made, both in the steeple and body of the church, by Robert Rhodes, the great benefactor to all our reli∣gious buildings.</P>
<P>His arms, which remain in two of the other churches, are found here also, under the belfry.—They are also placed over the window, on the outside of the south-cross. One William Hutton is conjec∣tured to have been one of the first benefactors to this church, from some punning devices, expressive of his name, after the manner of those times, which are still preserved in the glass of one of the south-east windows of the south-cross, and upon one of the pillars before the western gallery <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Dr. Ellison's MSS.—"In one of the south-east windows of the south-cross there is a coat of arms in the glass, but not coloured, viz. two fuller's clubs (I think), and in base, a tun.

<P>THIS house was filled with Dominicans, one of the four orders of mendicants or begging friars <NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot"><P>The orders of mendicants were instituted, according to the learned Warton, on the following occasion:—"The monastic orders, in consequence of their ample revenues, had degenerated from their primitive austerity, and, long before the thirteenth century, were totally abandoned to luxury and indolence. Hence a new order of religious was intro∣duced, who being destitute of fixed possessions, and of consequence obliged to rely on their own merits with the people, might restore respect to the monastic institution, and recover the honour of the church."—This order, one and the first of the four, is said to have been founded by St. Dominic, a native of Cologna, in Spain, A. D. 1198. Pope Innocent III. approved it in 1215, and it was confirmed by a bull of Pope Honorius the Third, in 1216. By some they are reported to have come into England, A. D. 1217, but ac∣cording to others, not till the year 1221.—Their first residence was at Oxford.—They boast of having produced a great number of martyrs and confessors—three popes, sixty cardinals, an hundred and fifty archbishops, and eight hundred bishops, and to have fur∣nished in this kingdom no less than eighty writers of eminence.</P>

Neither of them has the title of knight in the list of mayors, but Leland and a MS. which Bourne often cites, "De Reb. Novocastr" affix a "Sir" to each of their names. According to Leland, they were both merchants in Newcastle, and owners of the lordship of Eshett in Northumberland. "The beginning of these "Scotts," he observes, "was by merchandice."</NOTE>.</P>

<P><PB N="131" REF="160"/>A. D. 1551, Richard Marshall, one of the brethren of this house at the dissolution, and, it should seem, formerly prior, occurs at St. Andrew's in Scotland, very learnedly informing his audience there, that Pater noster should be addressed to God, and not to the Saints. See in a note subjoined, from the Preface to Knox's History of the Re∣formation, a picture of the manners of our monks, drawn from the life, and marked with striking traits of the wretched ignorance that prevailed in those times <NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">One Richard Marshall prior of the Blacke-Friars at Newcastle in England preach∣ed in St. Andrews, that the Pater-noster should be said to God only and not to the Saints. The doctors of St. Andrew's attended at it, made a Gray-Friar called Tottis preach a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>inst Marshall his tenet, which he did <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> (taking his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> out of the 5th of St. Mat∣thew, "Blessed are the poor in spirit"): Seeing we say good day, rather, to any old man in the street, we may call a Saint, Pater, who is older than any alive. And seeing they are in heaven, we may say to any of them, our Father which art in heaven. And seeing they are holy, we may say to any of them, hallowed be thy name. And since they are in the kingdom of heaven, we may say, thy kingdom come. And seeing their will is God's will, we may say to any of them, thy will be done. But when the Gray-Friar preaching came to the fourth petition, give us this day our daily bread, he was hissed at, and so was constrained not only to leave off preaching, but also to leave the city for shame. Yet among the doctors then assembled the dispute continued about the Pater, for some would have it said to God formaliter, and to the Saints materialiter. Others to God principa∣liter, to the Saints minus principaliter; others primario to God, secundario to the Saint<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, others would have it said to God taking it strictè, and to the Saints taking it late. Notwithstanding all their distinctions, the doctors could not agree upon the bu∣sinesse. A fellow called Tom, servant to the sub-prior of St. Andrews, one day per∣ceiving his master much troubled with some businesse, and as he conceived weighty, said to him, sir, what is the matter of this your trouble? The master answered, we can∣not agree about the saying of the Pater. The fellow replied, to whom should it be said but to God alone? The master answers, what shall we do then with the Saints? The fellow replies, give them aves and credes enough, that may suffice them and too well too." Bourne tells us, that he saw a grant of a tenement near the White-Cross, signed by friar Richard Marshall, doctor and prior, and friars David Simpson and John Sowrily, dated 28th of Hen.

<P>Before I enter upon the history of the Castle of Newcastle, I shall take occasion to give a brief account of the famous wall of the emperor Hadrian, which ended at the castrum of the Roman station of Pons Aelii, and that of the emperor Severus, which passed through the site of the present Newcastle, and ended at Wall's End.</P>
<P>Hadrian's Wall or Vallum, made A. D. 120, was a wall of turf, with a deep foss or ditch accompanying it on the north side: the ori∣ginal height of it is not known.</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="167"/>Severus' Wall was built, A. D. 207, of square stones, and every where also, except on the edges of precipices, was accompanied by a deep ditch or foss. The original height thereof was 12 feet, and the breadth 8. Between the village of Walker, <HI>i. e.</HI> the town by the wall, and Byker-Hill, the Wall of Severus, with its foss, are still plainly distinguishable: the site of the wall at present is covered with brush∣wood and stunted trees. Dr. Stukeley has preserved in his Iter Boreale a view of the appearance of the Roman Wall, between Byker-Hill Mill and Newcastle, when he wrote. From this mill to the Smith's shop near the first mile-stone on the Shields road, the site of the wall and hollow of the foss, running parallel with the present turnpike way, are yet clearly discernible.</P>
<P>At the head of the bank, over-looking Ouse-Burn, was a castellum or exploratory tower, out of the foundations of which I saw many Roman stones taken, not many years ago, to build an adjoining house.</P>
<P>Coing down the hill from thence to the rivulet of Ouse-Burn, the foss on the north side of the hedge is still very deep, and forms what is here called a little gill.</P>
<P>Severus' Wall must have formed a small angle at the arch by which it has crossed Ouse-Burn.</P>
<P>On the rise of the hill between this streamlet and Red-Barns I found, April 3d, 1783, many of the square stones which had evidently been the plunder of the wall.</P>
<P>About Red-Barns the garden grounds have destroyed every vestige both of the wall and the foss: but when we are past the gardens, the remains of the wall seem again to appear, and, having crossed the field, proceed in a straight line, behind the Keelman's Hospital, to the Sally-Port, or Ship-Carpenter's Tower. There was a rope-walk here, upon the foundation of the wall, not many years ago.</P>
<P>Near the present Sally-Port Gate stood a turret or Roman castlellum. From hence the wall, as the foundations thereof, which were discovered some years ago<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot"><P>Thomasin Scott, an old woman about 60 years of age, living on the Wall-Knoll, informed me April 3d, 1783, that several years ago some workmen, in building a coach-house there for Alderman Sowerby, discovered plainly the foundations of the Roman Wall coming over the top of the hill, and bearing to the north side of the present Sally-Port Gate, and that a great many curious gentlemen came to view it.</P>

the line of the town-wall, a little to the north of the West-Gate, where Horseley supposes a very small turn has been made in it, in order to come up to the north rampart of the station<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Horseley thus determines the boundaries and situation of the station of Pons Aelii: "I hinted before that there was a traditionary account of the wall's passing through St. George's Porch, near the north-west corner of St. Nicholas' church. But it is certain that the line of the wall lies a little to the north of this end of the church, and I think has not touched this porch, though it comes near it. And therefore I conjecture that the wall which has passed through this porch must have been the east rampart of the station; for the supposition will reconcile these seemingly different accounts: and if a line be erected perpendicular to that of Severus' Wall, so as to pass through that porch, and be continued along the brow of the hill, at the head of the side, till it meet the line of Ha∣drian's Vallum, near the cast end of Belygate, and not far from the Castle, this line seems to answer so well in all respects, that I cannot much doubt its having been the eastern limits of the ancient station: for this brings the station near to the Castle, which probably has been built a little more to the south-east, in order to bring it nearer to the top of a steep hill. And fixing the eastern boundary of the station here, leaves a plain and level area for the station itself, and without it, a descent towards the south and the river, for the town to stand upon, which might extend itself to the bridge, supposing the ancient bridge to have been near the same place where the present one stands. From which bridge the ancient town and station might probably take the name of Pons Aelii. This eastern boundary of the station must at that time have been nearer the river than it is now; since it is certain, that the river formerly flowed farther up towards this part of the town. The position of the eastern rampart of the station being thus determined, the other boundaries may be also defined; for the distance here between the lines of the walls seems to be about 6 charms, and it is not much to be questioned, but the two walls here (as in other cases they frequently did) have fallen in with the northern and southern ramparts of the station; so that these 6 chains have been the breadth of the station. And if we suppose the station to have been of a middle size, we must make it a square, and allow 6 chains for the length of it. If at this distance another line be drawn equal and parallel to the former, and between the lines of the wall, it will be the western boundary of the station, as the two respective parts of the two walls make the northern and southern limits. And upon this supposition, a line drawn from the scot of the Flesh Market to Barly Gate, near the east end of it, will be the eastern limits of the ancient station. That part of the vallum which reaches from Baily-Gate to Mr. Ord's house, will be the southern limit, and a line drawn from hence to that part of the line of Severus' Wall, which is about 30 yards east from the end of Rosemary-Lane, must be the western boundary, and the part of Severus' Wall included between this and the foot of the Flesh-Market, remains for the line of the northern rampart," page 133.</NOTE> at Newcastle, and to get to a sufficient distance from Hadrian's Vallum.</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="170"/>Horseley with great probability supposes that one of the extremities of Hadrian's Vallum was on the bank of the Tyne, beyond the castle, perhaps near the present half-moon battery (covered now with mo∣dern buildings), where there may have been a circular turret in the time of the Romans, to command the pass of the bridge.</P>
<P>This vallum, passing the north corner of the castle, went in a straight line<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">It crossed West-Gate, we collect from that writer, between the part or con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>luit, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> stood in his time not far from the end of Denton-Chare, and Barly Gate, but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to Baily-Gate, and, passing near the free school, intersected the line of the town well, but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> West-Gate and the smaller gate that leads to the Earth. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> that, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> before he wrote, a coin of Vespasian was found <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> he was told by the person that found it.

<P>Hadrian's Vallum, is with extreme probability supposed to have formed the southern rampart of the station of Pons Aelii, as Severus' Wall, at the distance of about six chains, may be naturally thought to have been the northern one. This station, most likely, has been square— The brow of the hill at the head of the Side easily directs us where to draw the line of the eastern rampart, running from St. George's Porch, till intercepted by Hadrian's Vallum, near Baily-Gate. And a line drawn from what was in Horseley's time Mr. Ord's house (lately Mr. Gibson's, the town-clerk's), to that part of the line of Severus' Wall which was about 30 yards east from the present Rosemary-Lane, shews as what must have been the western boundary of this fortification.</P>
<P>From that part of the line of the town-wall, where we left Severus' work, the track of it running westward has entirely been destroyed by buildings and gardens, till near the Turnpike-Gate, where it was thought distinguishable, in Horseley's time, in a small field between Quarry-House and Newcastle. That writer was of opinion that it

<P>Boethius and Buchanan say this castle was only repaired by Robert Curtois, son of the Conqueror. Boeth. p. 258. Buchanan, vol. i. p. 264.</P></NOTE>. Many considerations induce us to lament that no one has set about to give us a work to be intitled, "The Harmony of English Historians:" till that appear we may perhaps do something towards reconciling the various and clashing accounts of the building of this castle, by supposing that the earliest relate to the year when it was be∣gun, and the others to the time of its final completion.</P>
<P>However that may be, the greater part of our historians agree that this work was undertaken during the reign and at the command,
<PB N="144" REF="174"/>
of William the Conqueror, under the direction of Robert Curthose, his eldest son, on his return from an unsuccessful enterprize against Mal∣colm king of Scotland, who, presuming on the absence of William on the Continent, where he was likely to have been a long while detained by the revolt of the Normans, and the diversion of his French enemies, had passed the borders of the two kingdoms, and wasted the northern provinces of England.</P>
<P>Its having been called, on its erection, the "New Castle," seems strongly to imply that it arose from the site of some older fortress, from which, by way of contradistinction, it derived a name extended after∣wards to the adjoining town, and which is still retained in its present appellation <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">See Bourne.—The Milbank MS. he says, tells us, "that this New Castle may be dis∣tinguished from the old one," <HI>i. e.</HI> the Round Tower, since called the Half-Moon Bat∣tery, which is supposed to have been a Roman fortress, to command the pass of the bridge over the river Tyne, built by the Emperor Hadrian, and which gave its name to the Ro∣man station, <HI>i. e.</HI> Pons Aelii. See Account of Tyne-Bridge.</NOTE>. Thus, as Dr. Plot, in his History of Staffordshire, in∣forms us in a very similar instance, Newcastle under Lyme <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><P>Leland, in his Itinerary, vol. vii. fol. 36, says, "Newcastell under Line" is "so cawllid of a brooke renning therby, or of an hille or wodd therby so cawllid.

<P>Scarcely had this castle been completed, before it was converted to a purpose very different from the intention of building it, having been se∣cured to protect the rebellion of Earl Mowbray against William Rufus, the son and successor of William the Conqueror. The King marched against it, in the year 1095 <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><P>The words of Brompton are: "Detecta et cognita eorum fraude, Rex cum exercim m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gno Northumbriam adiit, ubi citò in quadam firmitate quae Novum Castrum vocatur, plures de proceribus se invicem alligatis cepit et eos in custodia posuit pro voto extra Angliam relegandes."—Decem Scriptores. p. 991.</P>

short siege, together with several of the partizans of that noble traitor. William, having missed the great object of his northern journey in this castle, sat down before that of Tinmouth, on the taking of which also he was a second time disappointed, for Earl Mowbray was found to have taken refuge in the fortress of Bambrough. After a tedious and fruitless siege of that castle, rendered by its natural situation almost im∣pregnable, the King returned southward, but not till he had erected a castle before it to cut off all hopes of throwing in succours, and filled it with his army, whom he directed to continue the blockade.</P>
<P>Driven, perhaps, to great straits through want of provisions, Mow∣bray closed with an offer of some of his faithful adherents, of whose loyalty the King had however entertained no suspicions, as he had ap∣pointed them the guards of this Newcastle upon Tyne: these had trai∣terously, and with secrecy, invited the Earl to take shelter in it. The unfortunate nobleman escaped from Bambrough, but was discovered during his flight to this castle, on which he suddenly changed his route, and took sanctuary in the church of St. Oswin at Tinmouth. The holy asylum could not protect so formidable an enemy of the King, for after being wounded, he was dragged out by violence from the altar, and made a prisoner <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><P>Thompton's account<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>: "Inde vero quodam also castello conquisito et statre consulis in eo capto, apud Bamburgh consulem post haec obsedit; quod cum armis inexpugnabile Rex viderit, aliud castellum ante illud paravit, quod Malveyseyn appellavit, in quo partem exercitus sui relinquens recessit.

<P>I am not satisfied with this etymology for the Moot-Hall in the castle of Newcastle.

<P>Gardiner, in his England's Grievance of the Coal Trade, &amp;c. p. 44, chap. xv. tells us, that Stevenson died in October 1640, in debt of 2,500l. and left Mr. Auditor Darel his executor, who was also one of his principal creditors.—This censorious writer goes on to charge the magistrates of Newcastle with greatly abusing their authority in this place, adding, that an information thereupon was exhibited against the mayor and bur∣gesses of that town, by Sir Henry Yelverton, Knt. attorney-general, in the 18th year of the reign of King James I.</P></NOTE>.</P>

<P>Complaint was made of an enormous dunghill, in length 98 yards, and 32 in breadth, and 10 yards deep, which imposed so prodigious a weight upon the wall on the west side of the castle, in length 40 yards, 10 yards in height, and two yards broad, as to have thrown down a great part thereof to the great detriment of the strength of the castle, the damage of which was computed at 120l.</P>
<P>It was also complained of, that the great square tower was full of chinks and crannies, and that one-third of it was almost taken away; that all the lead and covering which it had of old was embezzled and carried off, insomuch that the prisoners of the county of Northumberland were most miserably lodged, by reason of the showers of rain falling upon them.—They computed that the charge of repairing it would amount to 809l. 15s.— He adds, in a note, that the above enormous dunghill was taken away by Sir John Mar∣ley, mayor, and his adherents, to rampart the town's walls against the parliament and common-wealth.</P></NOTE>.</P>

<P>About the year 1662, the King was petitioned to grant this castle and its precincts, the lease whereof to Stevenson was within a few years of expiring, for the use of the town of Newcastle upon Tyne.</P>
<P>Upon this a dispute arose, whether a grant thereof were not more proper for the county of Northumberland than for the town, because it was alleged, though the said castle and garth stand in Newcastle, yet they belong to the county of Northumberland.</P>
<P>Lord Ogle, on behalf of that county, having had a conference with those who appeared for Newcastle, was convinced that it was more proper for the town of Newcastle to have them, on being assured that the gaol, &amp;c. should still continue for the service of the county as heretofore.</P>
<P>In the interim of this dispute, Lord Gerard prevented the corpo∣ration of Newcastle, and obtained a grant under the seal of the ex∣chequer, dated August 13th (or 30th) 1664, for 99 years in rever∣sion,

<P><PB N="172" REF="202"/>The subsequent observations on the present remains of this once famous and important fortress were made July 9th, 1778.</P>
<P>The Keep, or Great Tower, measured 28 yards and a quarter in height: it appears anciently to have been somewhat higher, and had, no doubt, a kernelled battlement.</P>
<P>The ichnography of this keep would describe nearly a square, the lines of two sides of which bear to the north-west. That front how∣ever, which, properly speaking, ought to be called the south-west front, is generally styled the south one. The others are named the west, north, and east sides, with the same little impropriety.</P>
<P>The grand entrance, originally, no doubt, the only one, is at a great height from the ground <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Mr. King, in his ingenious Essay on ancient Castles, Archaeologia, vol. iv. speaking of Canterbury castle, says, p. 390, "Whoever looks at that ancient structure attentively, will easily perceive that the present entrances have been forced, and could never have been there originally."</NOTE>. Two portals, as it were, must be passed before we can arrive at it <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">"The entrance was not in any ancient castle that I have seen, in the lower story, or upon the ground, or near it, but at a considerable height, and was by means of a grand stair-case—there was also a strong gate about the middle of the stair-case."—Ibid. p. 369.</NOTE>.—From the first of these, which is on the south, and in a great wall <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot"><P>"There were two great strong walls," says Bourne, "which surrounded the castle. The interior wall was of no great distance from the castle itself, as may be still seen in several places. The exterior wall surrounds the verge of the castle bounders. From this outer wall were four gates: the great gate and three posterns. On the north side of the castle is the main gate, now called the Black-Gate. It has had two portcullises, one without the gate, as may be still seen, and another within it at a little distance from it, the ruins of which were to be seen a few years ago. On the east side of the castle there was a postern which led down to the street called the Side, which is still to be seen.—On the south side of the castle is another gate, which leads down the castle stairs to the street called the Close. This was called the South-Postern. There is an old building upon it, which was the county-gaoler's house. On the west-side was the postern facing Bailiff-Gate.—There is an house in the yard (<HI>i. e.</HI> Castle-Garth or Yard), where they say was the chapel of the garrison, which is called the Chapel-House to this day: it stands north-east from the chapel (he means the chapel of the castle or keep); its common name now is the Three Bulls Heads" (<HI>i. e.</HI> an Inn with that sign).</P>
<P>Since Bourne's time, in digging cellars for this inn, human bones, as also a large stone coffin, were found.</P>
<P>Dr. Stukeley, who visited this castle in 1725, seems to have mistaken a part of its outer-wall for what he calls, "a bit of the true old Roman Wall." See Iter Boreale, p. 64, et seq.</P>
<P>There is a place still called the Mount, on the south side of this keep, and within the outer wall of the fortification.</P>
<P>"Large mounts," says Grose, ut supra, p. 7, "were also often thrown up in this place: these served like modern cavaliers to command the adjacent country."</P></NOTE>, which, at a few yards distance, has in∣closed
<PB N="173" REF="203"/>
the whole keep, we mount by eleven steps to the second one, which is of prodigious strength, and from the top of it the be∣sieged appear to have had great power to annoy the assailants.</P>
<P>From this second portal to the grand entrance are eighteen steps, part leading from south to north, and part from east to west. No grooves for portcullises <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">"The Herse or Portcullis was a strong grating of timber, fenced with iron, made to slide up and down in a groove of solid stone-work, within the arch of the portal, just as a sash-window does in its frame, and its bottom was furnished with sharp iron spikes, designed both to strike into the ground or floor, for the sake of greater firmness and so∣lidity, and also to destroy and break whatever should be under it at the time of its being let fall; and its groove was always contrived to deep in the stone-work that it could not be injured or removed without pulling down the whole wall."—King, ut supra, p. 370.</NOTE> are discoverable in either of the portals, but so much appears to have been demolished that one cannot from thence infer that there have never been any.</P>
<P>The grand entrance which is towards the east, has had its arch adorned in a superb manner, with zig-zag, and other Saxon or semi-Saxon ornaments.</P>
<P>The wall here measured four yards and a quarter in thickness <NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Pennant, in his Tour in Scotland, vol. m p. 305, speaking of the place, tells us, "The walls of Roberts Tower are thirteen feet thick, with galleries ga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed out of them." He adds, "The height of this tower was eighty-two feet: the square on the outside sixty-two by fifty four."</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Near this grand entrance, and in front as you ascend to it from south to north, is a door-way leading into a little apartment, which has been richly adorned on the inside.—It stands over a crypt or vault of consi∣derable height, on two great arches that intersect each other, of beauti∣ful
<PB N="174" REF="204"/>
Gothic masonry.—This had a distinct roof, and the whole forms a projection eastward at the north-east angle, against the east end of which a modern house has been built. From the garret of this house there is at present an entrance into it through an arched passage, where there must have been anciently a window. At present it is a currier's shop. From the richness of its interior ornaments I suspected it to have been the chapel, to which supposition its direction from east to west is not unfavourable. It must however have been but a very small one. Bourne supposes the chapel to have been within the walls of this keep, on the ground floor, in a place which at present composes a part of Mr. Fife's very curious and extensive cellar.</P>
<P>The great entrance seems to have led immediately into the state apartments <NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">"The room," says Bourne, "this grand entrance leads into, has its floor broken down close to the castle-wall, as indeed all the other floors are, to the top of the castles so that, excepting the floor above the county-gaol, there is not one left, though there have been five divisions or stories of the castle besides this. This floored room, flagged by William Ellison, Esq. mayor of Newcastle, in 1723, seems to me, without any doubt, to have been the common hall of the castle—because, on the north side of the same room there is an entrance by a descent of some steps, into one where is the largest fire-place I saw in the castle, which plainly speaks it to have been the kitchen."—Near this kitchen Bourne supposed he could also trace the pantry and cellar.—"On the south of this room," says Bourne also, "there is an entrance into a sort of a parlour, or withdrawing-room, which has a fire-place in it, which has been a piece of curious workman∣ship, as is visible to this day. And this place has no communication with any part of the castle but this room."</NOTE>, which have been lighted from the east, by the most mag∣nificent window in the whole great tower. Near this, and in the body of the wall, is an apartment with a curious draw-well in it—at sixteen yards depth <NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">The water was two yards lower in Bourne's time.</NOTE> we reached the water. The depth in all is thirty-one yards and a quarter. The water is hard and very cold. There are square cavities in the wall on each side of this well, in which are round holes for pipes, used anciently to convey the water to the several apart∣ments. It measures eleven yards to the ground from the window of the apartment that contains the well.</P>
<P>There is no way at present to the top of this keep, where one is sur∣prised
<PB N="175" REF="205"/>
to find a little artificial garden, producing apple-trees, rose-bushes, &amp;c. except by one great winding stair-case, about two yards wide, in the north-east angle. There is another stair-case <NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Thus King, ut supra, p. 390—speaking of Canterbury castle, he tells us, "There are two circular stair-cases in the corners."</NOTE> in the south-east angle, but it is now built up at the top. It has come down to the ground floor, at which place also the communication is now closed up.</P>
<P>By the rows of square holes in which the beams have rested, there must have been five stories of apartments, of which the great hall and state rooms were the lowest, from the present flagged floor to the top of this tower.</P>
<P>There is a gallery of communication in the center or thickness of the wall, and on all four sides of it, about five yards and a half<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot"><P>Thus King, ut supra, p. 379—"Within the thickness of the wall—a gallery—that orders might be speedily communicated to all parts.—And there was besides another smaller and narrower gallery within the thichness of the wall in the floor above."</P>
<P>Speaking also of Guildford castle, he says, "There are also galleries in the thickness of the wall, as at Rochester."</P></NOTE> from the top. This passage is about two yards and a half high, and has three or four loup holes on each side, all widening gradually inwards.</P>
<P>Below this in the south front is a gallery in the center of the wall, about fifteen yards and three quarters from the ground, in which there have been two large ornamented windows—nearly on a level with which on the north front is another window of the like sort.</P>
<P>Two great windows have let in light to the great hall <NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">"These great rooms," says King, ut supra, p. 378, 379, "were undoubtedly hung with arras."</NOTE> of this keep; that in the south front, near the south-west angle, having had the pillar or division in it broken away, has now the appearance of a door-way. A door hardly half its size is at present hung in it. The other window is very observable: it is on the west side near the south-west angle.</P>
<P>The kitchen of this great tower has been in the north wall: it con∣tains a much larger fire-place than any other of the apartments. The chimney appears on the outside of the wall by a square projection,
<PB N="176" REF="206"/>
ending abruptly, and yet I know not with any degree of certainty whether ever it has been carried up any higher: one of its windows has been enlarged with great labour, to give more light to a joiner's shop, into which it has been converted.</P>
<P>The north-west angle of this tower is of an hexagonal form <NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">"Neither do they seem to have confined themselves to any particular figure in their towers; square, round, and polygonal oftentimes occurring in the original parts of the same building." Grose, ut supra, p. 5.</NOTE>, and projects in a manner different from any of the others <NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Thus King, ut supra, p. 388.—"The outlets to the sinks and other conveyances of filth were nearly in the same manner (as the chimneys), only reversed and going down∣wards."</NOTE>. In the wall of the western front have been several necessary-houses, communicat∣ing with the great drains.</P>
<P>All the apartments of the ground-floor, and the county-prison itself, except when used at the assizes, have been converted into cellars: a pur∣pose for which their great coolness renders them very fit.—There is a place here, into which if water be poured in the largest quantities, it im∣mediately disappears.—It probably communicates with one of the large drains.</P>
<P>In the center of the present county prison is a remarkable pillar, from which arches branch out very beautifully on all sides. This co∣lumn is hollow, and a pipe has <NOTE N="v" PLACE="foot">"Having a hollow in the middle," says Bourne, "of a foot wide, with a lead spout in the side of it."</NOTE> conducted water down through it from the well before-mentioned. There is a very observable window <NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot"><P>"Windows," says he, "were so contrived, that it was almost impossible for any wea∣pon to be shot into the room, so as to do any hurt: for if it went at all ascending, it would strike against a low arch, purposely contrived over every window, and could not enter the room at all." King, ut supra, p. 374.</P>
<P>I know not which is the house, which, Bourne says, was anciently the county-gaol, and underneath which, he adds, "It is reported there is a vault which leads to the castle."— "There is indeed a large door," he continues, "still to be seen, which was perhaps the entrance into it: and Mr. George Grey, the present possessor, told me that it was cer∣tainly so because he had put down through his own sloot a bailiff's rod, to the very end, and could find no bottom."</P>
<P>I know not on what authority Bourne rests his information when he tells us that the castle-gate (I suppose he means the Black-Gate) was begun to be built by one George Hayroy, but was finished by one John Pickle, who kept a tavern in it.</P></NOTE> in
<PB N="177" REF="207"/>
this place, with an arch turned in the inside to repel missile weapons, &amp;c. See an account of many similar ones in King's ingenious ac∣count of ancient castles, ut supra.</P>
<P>Great alterations must have been made in the appearance of the low parts of the south front, when the temporary prison of the county was made in this keep. The present entrance, to which we descend by four or five steps, must have been first made on that occasion, for there is no arch over it in the wall. Another similar kind of entrance on the eastern side of the south-east angle, which is now built up, with a swine-stye before it, is also, without doubt, of a date much posterior to that of the original building.—</P>
<P>If there has been a dungeon in this keep, as there probably was, I mean that dreary kind of mansion, to which the only entrance was by a square hole in the top, it must have been filled up, as no traces thereof can be discovered at present.</P>

<HEAD>ST. ANDREW'S CHURCH.</HEAD>
<P>THIS building appears to have retained more of its original masonry than the other churches, and, from the style of its architecture, has been generally thought to be the oldest in the town <NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot"><P>See Bourne's account. David King of Scots, it is unknown for what reason, is men∣tioned in the MS. de Rebus Novo Castr', which he often cites, as its founder.</P>
<P>The arch that separates the chancel from the body of the church is of the semi Saxon style, with zig-zag ornaments, which proves it to have been built not long after the con∣quest.</P>
<P>In the columns that support this arch, there are proofs hewn out in stone, that some of the Romish exhibitions in churches were, comparatively speaking, no more than inno∣vations. These plainly appear to have been cut away in parallel directions, to gain sup∣ports for the rood loft, which stood under this arch before the Reformation.—For an ac∣count of rood lofts, see Staveley on Churches, p. 199.</P></NOTE>.</P>

<HEAD>MONUMENTAL INSCRIPTIONS IN ST. ANDREW'S CHURCH AND CHURCH-YARD.</HEAD>
<P>TRINITY Chapel. Sir Adam de Athol, and his wife Mary, un∣der a very large stone, which has originally been plated very curiously with brass. The remains of their effigies are still to be seen.—He is pictured at length in armour, having a sword on his left side, and a dagger on his right.—Her effigy hath nothing remaining of it but from the shoulders upwards.—The arms of both their families are still to be seen on the tomb-stone.</P>
<P>What remains of the inscription is this: "Hic jacent Dominus Ada∣marus de Atholl miles &amp; Domina Maria uxor ejus quae obiit quarto decimo die mensis ..... anno Domini millesimo tricentesimo...... Animarum propitietur."—The remaining part of the date is broken off: Grey, however, in his account of this stone, tells us, it was in the year 1387, which is very probably the time that his wife died; for it is a mistake that he died then, as appears by the indulgence above∣mentioned.—Bourne.</P>

<P>The account of this, evidently the oldest of the monastic buildings here, of which any vestiges are now to be found, cannot be impro∣perly prefaced with a short history of the first introduction of Christi∣anity into this part of the island.</P>

<P>The place now called Newcastle upon Tyne he mentions, 26 years afterwards, as the scene of occurrences instrumental, in no common degree, to the general propagation of our religion throughout the whole island, by the name of "Ad Murum <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">See under "Annals and Historical Events," the proofs that "Ad Murum" was neither "Wall-Town,"—"Walbottle," nor "Benwall," but stood upon part at least of the site of the present Newcastle upon Tyne.</NOTE>" (<HI>i. e.</HI> At Wall), as the re∣sidence of the then Christian King of Northumberland, and where two other royal converts became such by the initiatory rite of baptism.</P>

Struck with the excellence of the doctrines of this new faith, which were warmly recommended to him on the occasion by his friend Alchfrid, the natural son of Oswy, who had married Cyniburga his sister, he declared himself a convert by conviction; and having been baptized, together with his retinue, by Finan, Bishop of Lindisfarn, obtained a bride, with whom he may be said to have received a truly royal dower, and who would, doubtless, encourage him in the promulgation of the Christian faith, throughout his extensive dominions. There accompanied him on this mission of conversion from the court of the Northumberland King, four priests, Cedda, Adda (brother of Uttanus, abbot of Gateshead), Betti and Dinmi, to teach and baptize his Mercian subjects, on their return home.</P>

<P>To the ancient name of our town, "Ad Murum," succeeded the ap∣pellation of Monk-Chester: it is uncertain at what period this new title took place, which has generally been interpreted "The fortified resi∣dence of persons of the monastic order,<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">"Sir Robert Shastoe (a former recorder of Newcastle) was of opinion that Monk-Chester had its name from the neighbouring monks' retiring to it for occasional protection in times of danger and devastation."

<P>On the introduction of monastic orders, with whom not only the reliques of saints, but also the scenes of events of great consequence to religion, were held in the highest estimation, it seems no very impro∣bable conjecture that a place consecrated to the warm imaginations of these well-meaning zealots, by circumstances so remarkable as have been just related, should be accounted sacred in more than a common degree: if we farther unite the idea of personal safety expected in what had been so recently a Roman fortification, and so often wanted in the times of the Danish invasions, with that of sanctity affixed to it by something not unlike superstition, it seems natural to suppose that those ancient devotees would prefer it on both accounts. However this may have been, we are certain, from the clearest testimony of historians, that monks, in more than ordinary numbers, resided at it, and learn farther that neither the idea of local sanctity with which we have pre∣sumed its then inhabitants to have been impressed, nor the military

The holy travellers performed it on foot, in all the plainness of pristine simplicity, leading a little ass car∣rying some books and sacred vestments necessary for the performance of divine service. This happened A. D. 1073. On their arrival at Northumberland their residence was for some time at Monk-Chester: but finding there no vestige of the former monastic orders, and having been invited by Walcher, then Bishop of Durham, to place themselves under the jurisdiction of the church, rather than accept an habitation under the power of secular persons, they removed from thence a little way down the river to Jarrow, which before that time had been a famous monastery, and, though then in ruins also, was fitted up a

<P>About A. D. 1523, or 1524, great differences occur concerning the right of creating an abbess, or prioress, in the nunnery of this house. A prioress, it seems, had been elected to it by the abbot of Newminster, which Wolsey, then Bishop of Durham, as the ordinary, thought an infringement of his power.</P>
<P>Lord Dacre, warden of the marches, had interested himself in fa∣vour of the prioress and the claim of the abbot; but numerous prece∣dents, found in the bishop's registers, fully established the justice of the episcopal pretensions.</P>
<P>The personal worth of the lady, then not quite thirty years of age, conciliated favour on this occasion, and she was re-instated by a new and proper election; the vicar-general advising her friends to procure a dispensation for her non-age, and promising, in consideration of the poverty of the house, a mitigation of the fees of election and insti∣tution <NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">See Hearne's Chronicle of Otterbourne and Whethamstede, vol. ii. p. 556, letter-B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>and 5.</NOTE>.</P>

<P><PB N="230" REF="260"/>It has been supposed that all the hospital lands and revenues of St Edmund's Hospital, in Gateshead, were comprised in Agnes Lawson's surrender in 1540, as above, and that they continued in the hands of the crown from that time till the year 1610, when King James I. by letters patent, refounded the hospital in Gateshead <NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Allan's printed collections.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The annual revenue of this house, 26 Hen. VIII. was about 36l. 10s. according to Dugdale, but Speed makes it 37l. 4s. 9d.</P>
<P>Stevens, in his Continuation, vol. ii. p. 25, values it thus: "Summa inde 37l. 4s. 2d.—summa clara 36l. 0s. 10d. <NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot"><P>"In Darn-Crook," says Bourne, "were some wastes and houses belonging to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ms of St. Bartholomew, as there were in almost every street of the town."—"In the Pudding-Chare," he adds, "there is a waste which belonged to the nuns of St. Bartho∣lomew boundering on the west on the common gutter, and on the north on the chantry lands."—This waste is the ground where, in Mr. Bourne's time, were the gardens of Mr. James Bell, post-master, and the old houses on the north of these gardens, at that time the property of Mr. Ralph Trotter, were the chantry lands here mentioned.—Wallis, in his History of Northumberland, is much mistaken in his references on this head.</P>
<P>By an inquisition, dated September 2d, 1577, it appears, that a waste in a street of New∣castle, called "Allhallow Ban<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ke," belonged to these nuns.—There occurs also, ibid. mention of the waste belonging to them in St. John's Church-Chare.—Also of two house, their property, in the Side, and a house and waste in Darne-Crooke, of the annual value of 6s. 8d.—In the above inquisition, it is said, that Sir Robert Brandling, Knight, pur∣chased certain of the lands pertaining to the said nuns of St. Bartholomew.</P>
<P>Bourne says also, that "Mr. Riddell's house and chapel in Gateshead (commonly called Gate<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d House) was, according to some, a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>firmary for the nuns of this hos∣pital.

N<SUP>o</SUP> 68, in Consist' Dunelm.</NOTE>: after this it became so great a receptacle of Scots, and others not free burgesses of the town, persons who, during the odium that prevailed at that time against foreigners, were not accounted the most respectable neighbours, that Mr. Anderson thought proper to pull it down, in order to dislodge them.

<P>Within our own memory it belonged to the late Sir Walter Blackett, Bart. and after his death was sold, A.

<P>The exact site of this nunnery is now unknown <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot"><P>Two great houses are marked out hereabouts in Speed's Plan of Newcastle, 1610— one is called "King's Lodgings,"—the other, "The Manor," a part of the Nuns.— I should think it stood near the spot where a play-house has since been erected. Indeed the play-house seems supported by part of the north-wall of St. Bartholomew's church, in which the north door-way, built up with stone, is still observable; so that where once these daughters of celibacy and retirement heard their masses, Thalia and Melpomene now laugh and weep by turns, and farces of another kind have succeeded to the super∣stitious rites of papal Rome.</P>
<P>The above play-house, erected by Mr. William Parker, master of the Turk's Head Inn, was finished in the latter end of the year 1748.</P>
<P>On a view of the Nuns in 1777, I discovered that part of the meadow which, Bourne tells us, was filled up to make the ground level—part seems to have been left in its original state, in order to preserve a very fine well—this has occasioned a remarkable artificial hol∣low. I found also the issues of the two great conduits, where Lamborn and Lorkburn unite in the deen.—One of them points up towards Fickett-Tower, where it passes through the town-wall, and the other towards Execution-Dock.</P></NOTE>: Bourne, as I
<PB N="234" REF="264"/>
think, erroneously supposes, that the passage still called Nun-Gate was not the grand entrance to it. Here very lately remained part of a great arch, that once formed a gateway, very unlike that of a back passage; especially when we consider the general poverty of style in building that prevailed at the time when this was erected.</P>
<P>The popular tradition, of a subterraneous communication with a neighbouring monastery, prevailed here also <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">See Grose's account of Godstow nunnery, in Oxfordshire: there is a similar tradi∣tion of a subterraneous passage under the Thames, from Syon nunnery to the friary of Sheen, now called Richmond, in Surry.</NOTE>: this was said to have been made for purposes that we shall but hint at, and to have ended at the house of Black-Friars. Some large vaulted drain has probably given rise to the charge against our fair and, as it should seem by this account, frail sisterhood, and it has owed its support to the ill-nature of religious party, than which no species of rancour has been found to be more malignant.</P>

<HEAD>ST. NICHOLAS' CHURCH.</HEAD>
<P>THIS very capacious and superb structure, dedicated to St. Ni∣cholas <NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot"><P>St. Nicholas was Bishop of Myra, a city in Lycia, a province of Asia Minor; he lived about the beginning of the fourth century, and during the persecution of Licinius the Roman Emperor, was sent into banishment: but after the death of that tyrant, he re∣visited his diocese, and threw out all the idols which he found in it. He is said to have assisted at the general council of Nice, where he strenuously opposed the Arians. He commemorated on the sixth of December.</P>
<P>Bourne says, that in his time a large flag, which was the first step into the church, at the north door, was cut all along the surface with uneven lines, in imitation of the waves of the sea, as a silent remembrancer of this Saint, so famous among some for his miracles and apparitions by sea, that he has merited the title of the Patron of the Sailors.</P>
<P>There is a perspective view of "St. Nicholas' church in Newcastle upon Tyne," in∣scribed to Lord Crew, Bishop of Durham. W. Horseley, del.</P></NOTE>, is styled, in the earliest accounts of it, "The church of New∣castle upon Tyne <NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot"><P>See afterwards under Henry I.</P>
<P>Yet perhaps it was so called by way of eminence: for we find, that although in the ordering of the vicarage by Hugh Pudsey, Bishop of Durham, A. D. 1194, it is called "the church of St. Nicholas, of Newcastle upon Tyne;" yet afterwards, in the year 1248, it is simply styled, "the church of Newcastle," when that of St. Andrew appears to have been built by unquestionable evidence.</P>
<P>However that may have been, it was certainly the mother, or parish-church, to which the other three were no more than parochial chapels, built, it is probable, at different pe∣riods, as the town was enlarged or became more populous.</P>
<P>The respective limits of the four parishes, or parochial districts, in Newcastle upon Tyne, are said to have been settled in the year 1220, if we may credit an account in Warburton's MS. collections remaining in the archives of the Duke of Northum∣berland.</P></NOTE>:" a circumstance which seems to prove it to be the oldest, as having been at that time the only church of the town.</P>

<P>According to Dr. Ellison's MSS. this chantry was founded by Laurentius, prior of Durham.</P></NOTE>. It was refounded in the year 1333, by Richard de Emeldon <NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot"><P>"Richard de Emeldon, who had been above twelve times mayor of Newcastle, was permitted by letters patent from King Edward III. to build upon a piece of vacant ground over against the chapel of St. Thomas the martyr, that he might present it to three chap∣lains to procure their prayers for him whilst he was living, and after he was dead. And also for the souls of his wives and his father and mother, &amp;c. every day at the altar in St. Nicholas, which was dedicated to John the Baptist and John the Apostle and Evangelist. This gentleman died about the 6th or 7th of the reign now mentioned, as is clearly ga∣thered from the authority above; and the letters in which this chantry is mentioned beat date the sixth of this reign: and therefore it is a mistake to suppose this chantry founded in the reign of Henry VI. which was almost an hundred years after."</P>
<P>"The priests set apart to attend this altar were every day to pray for his soul and the others above mentioned. And by an order from the then Richard, Lord Bishop of Dur∣ham, the chaplains for the time being were obliged, on the anniversary of his death every year for ever, to celebrate his memory with a solemn tolling of the bells, and devoutly sing¦ing by note in the evening of the anniversary, and on the anniversary itself, and solemnly to sing mass for the soul of Richard himself, and the souls above-mentioned, and the souls of all the faithful departed. And after mass one of the chaplains was to distribute among 160 poor people the sum of 6s. 8d. and this annually for ever. This, together with several other things, was ordered by Richard, Bishop of Durham, in the third year of his consecration, A. D. 1335, which was with all other things mentioned in the charter con∣firmed by Edward III. in the 10th year of his reign.

<HEAD>CHANCEL OF ST. NICHOLAS.</HEAD>
<P>THE holy table or altar, which in the primitive and in the late re∣forming times was made of wood, in the middle corrupted times was generally composed of stone, "as more corresponding with the import of an altar, whereon the sacrifice of the mass was and is still offered up in the Roman church <NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Staveley on Churches, p. 207.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>This, to distinguish it from the smaller altars dedicated to saints in chantries, was styled in the papal times the high altar <NOTE N="v" PLACE="foot">See before A. D. 1349 and 1379.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It appears to have been placed anciently in different parts of the church, sometimes in the middle and sometimes in the eastermost part of the chancel, according to the different fashions of the building <NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot"><P>Staveley, ut supra, p. 212, 213.</P>
<P>The words of Bourne are, "The chancel of this church is a very noble and stately one. At the top is the word Jehovah, and under that in a glory a part of the name of the Lord, which he himself proclaimed before Moses.—See in the altar of All-Hallows."</P>

<HEAD>FONT.</HEAD>
<P>IN primitive times the rite of baptism was performed in rivers and fountains. Fonts were at first erected in private houses, and afterwards placed in the church porch, and lastly in the church itself, near the en∣trance, as subservient to the sacrament of initiation or admittance <NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Bede's Eccles. Hist. lib. ii. cap. 14. Staveley on Churches, p. 219, 220.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The font of this church, with a wooden cover to it of very light and elegant workmanship, has either been made or repaired by Robert Rhodes, the builder of the upper part of the steeple: for his coat of arms, with another, probably his wife's, is sculptured on the basis <NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot"><P>Bourne.</P>
<P>The arms are "parted per fess, gules and azure—in chief is a grey-hound current, and in base three annulets."</P>
<P>There is quartered with this coat argent, a chevron gules, between three rooks, or, within a border engrailed—supposed to be the coat of Agnes, wife of Robert Rhodes.</P></NOTE>.</P>

<HEAD>WINDOWS.</HEAD>
<P>"IN this church" says Bourne, "are many sumptuous windows, but that in the east surpasseth all the rest in height, largeness and beauty." Grey says, that there were in this window the twelve apostles, and the seven deeds of charity painted in the glass. He tells us also, that this window was built by the beneficent Roger Thornton the elder,
<PB N="268" REF="300"/>
and that there was this inscription on it: "Orate pro anima Rogeri de Thornton &amp; pro animabus filiorum et filiarum." At present there is nothing remaining of these pictures but fragments—two heads, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>The windows of this church have many of them been entirely new built on the late alteration.—The figure of our Saviour in modern stained glass, of very miserable execution, has been happily concealed by it.</P>

<HEAD>ORGAN.</HEAD>
<P>STAVELEY is of opinion that organs <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">History of Churches, p. 203.</NOTE> are of eastern invention, and tells us that the first used in the western church was sent out of Greece to Pepin, King of France, about the year 766. I have found no account of any organ in this church during the times of popery, though it is very probable there has been one <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">See account of St. John's.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>About the year 1676, the corporation of Newcastle contributed 300l. towards the erection of the present organ. <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Common-council books.</NOTE>. They added a trumpet stop to it June 22d, 1699 <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>June 26th, 1749, the common-council of Newcastle ordered a sweet stop to be added to this organ <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><P>Common-council books—from whence I selected the following names of the or¦ganists:

<P>There is a character of Mr. Charles Avison, given in Dr. Gregory's Faculties of Man compared with those of the Animal World.

<P>IN the north part of this church of St. Nicholas, was a shrine of Henry, the fourth Earl of Northumberland, who, on the day of St. Vitalis the Martyr, <HI>i. e.</HI> April 28th, 1489, fell a victim to the unre∣lenting avarice of King Henry VII. to whom the parliament, in that year, had granted a subsidy, for carrying on the war in Bretagne, which fell heavy on the people, and put the whole country in a flame.—The good Earl, then Lord Lieutenant, wrote to inform the King of the discontent, and prayed an abatement.—The King's answer was, that not a penny should be abated. This message being delivered by the Earl with too little caution to the populace, who had come in a tu∣multuous manner to complain of the grievance, they supposed him to be the promoter of their calamity, and instantly breaking into his house at Cock's-Lodge, near Thirske, in Yorkshire, murdered him, and several of his attendants. He was buried in Beverly Minster, where

<P>Grey, in his Chorographia, tells us, that in this part of the church there was such a monument in his time, "that was made in memory of him in his own country, he having a house in this town and pa∣rish <NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">See account of the Earl's Inn in the account of the street called the Close.</NOTE>;" and that part of the inscription upon it was, "Orate pro anima Henrici Percy 4 (com') Northumbriae qui per rebellium manus occubuit &amp;c."</P>
<P>"The Milbank manuscript," as we read in Bourne's History, "says that it was in the north corner of the church: that it was a monu∣ment of wood, on which was painted an old man, our Saviour on his right hand, and the Virgin Mary on his left. There came a label from her mouth, but what it was this authority had forgot; but that from our Saviour's was Quaeso Pater, fac, quod rogat mea mater. Then followed some Latin verses, done in the rhyming way of the monks, but they are so dark and obscure, that little can be made of them." The MS. goes on: "When Mr. William Selby was buried, this monument was removed out of that corner, and Sir George Selby did set his magnificent tomb there."—"After that it was placed against the wall, next to Sir George's tomb, and so continued till Mr. Lanc' Hodshon got leave of Vicar Nailor to remove it, and place his father; where it is now I know not."—At present, 1787, no vestiges of this ceno∣taph remain.</P>
<P>In the north-east corner of this church was the tomb of Sir George Selby. His effigies, and that of his lady, were at length, resting upon pillows, with uplifted hands—On the south of the tomb were the ef∣figies of his children, in a posture of prayer, kneeling, with raised hands.—Upon a marble stone, placed in the wall, a little above the

<P>In the north side of the middle porch, under the great eastern win∣dow, were the remains of a monument on which statues had been inlaid, but taken away, probably, for the sake of the brass.

These skin marks were not used instead of arms, but rather as distinct insignia appropriated to the profession of merchandise.

<P>At the feet of the effigies were the ruins of a large image of our Sa∣viour upon the Cross, with an inscription equally dark as the other, but said to be this: "Our Lady prays him to say at the day."</P>
<P>When the Scots took the town they plundered the churches, and these, and many more, were defaced; for they broke down the carved work thereof with axes and hammers.</P>
<P>On the north side of the south-east porch was a small monument, commemorating the wife of William Wrightson, Esq. "Near this place lies the body of Isabel the wife of William Wrightson, Esq. one of the burgesses in several parliaments for this town and county. She died. the 13th of March 1716."</P>

<P>"Sept. 8, 1787. We are favoured with the following description of the elegant monument, lately erected in St. Nicholas' church, in this town, to the memory of Matthew Ridley, of Blagdon and Heaton, in the county of Northumberland, Esq.—A figure in statuary marble, as large as life, bearing a resemblance of the features and person of the late Mr. Ridley (at the period to which the medallion and inscription allude), is represented in a Roman habit, sitting in the curule chair, the seat of magistracy, with a serious, but placid countenance, as con∣sidering of the general welfare of the people over whom he presided; under the chair are placed the scales and fasces, as emblems of justice and authority; beneath this is the entablature, containing the follow∣ing inscription: "To the memory of Matthew Ridley, Esq. of Blag∣don and Heaton, in the county of Northumberland, senior alderman of the corporation of this town, and governor of the company of mer∣chant-adventurers. He four times served the office of mayor, in which station, in the year 1745, he rendered essential service to his country; averting, by his prudence and activity, the attack meditated against this town, by the enemies of the House of Brunswick, and thereby materially checking the progress of their arms. He was unanimously elected by his fellow burgesses to represent them in five successive par∣liaments, and retired from that situation when the declining state of his health rendered him incapable of conscientiously fulfilling the duties of it. He lived respected and beloved, and died unfeignedly lamented, April 6, 1778. Aged 66."</P>
<P>"The base of the monument is formed by a medallion, on which the town of Newcastle is represented by a female figure, crowned with turrets, having a shield by her, bearing the arms of the town; near her is an urn, from which are seen issuing salmon, the peculiar attribute of the river Tyne, attacked by Rebellion, who, treading on the crown and sceptre (ensigns of royalty), bears in one hand the torch of sedi∣tion,
<PB N="283" REF="317"/>
in the other the sword of destruction: in an attitude of suppli∣cation she inclines herself towards an armed figure, who protects her with his shield, and with a sword in his right hand resists the figure of Rebellion; on the shield are represented the arms of the family of Ridley; the helmet is ornamented with a bull, which is the crest. As a finishing, under the medallion two cornucopias are introduced, representing the general effect of plenty (attendant on the care of active magistrates), connected by a civic crown, the reward amongst the Romans of civil virtue. The figure is placed against an obelisk of white marble, eight feet high, on the top of which is a very elegant urn, bearing the family arms emblazoned; and on the foot of it is engraved the motto, "Constans Fidei." The whole is relieved by a ground of dove-coloured marble.</P>
<P>"We feel it a justice we owe to the superior abilities of the artist, to add, that this elegant monument was executed by John Bacon, Esq. of the Royal Academy, whose natural genius, unassisted by foreign travel, has raised him decidedly to the first rank in his profession, and has enabled the present day to vie with the most celebrated ages of antiquity in works of sculpture. The many invaluable proofs of ex∣cellence with which this artist has enriched his native country, as well as foreign lands, it is unnecessary here to enumerate; until the magni∣ficent monument in Westminster-Abbey, designed and executed by him, to the memory of the late Earl of Chatham, shall moulder into dust, his fame will be had in remembrance <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Newcastle Courant</NOTE>."</P>

<P>"In this isle," says Bourne, "opposite to the altar, against the wall of the church is a beautiful and curious monument of William Hall, Esq. sometime mayor of this town, and Jane his wife, which was erected in commemoration of them by Sir Alexander Hall, Knight, their only sur∣viving son. At the top of the monument are the arms of the family, with an angel on each side of them. The body of the monument has on each side of it a pillar of the Corinthian order; between which is the representation of a desk with open books upon it, and he on the one side of it, and his wife on the other, in the posture of prayer, kneeling before it, with their folded hands upon the books: below this are the essigies of their children in the same posture; one of which is repre∣sented kneeling alone, at one side of a desk, with an open book upon it; and other five on the other side of it, kneeling one after another. The former supposed to be designed for their son, the other for their daughters. Below is the following inscription: "Gulielmus Hall, Ar∣miger, quondam major hujus villae, et Jana uxor ejus charissima: felici prole ditati, juxta hoc monumentum in Domino requiescunt. Ille vi∣cesimo octavo die Julii anno Domini 1631, aetatis suae 63. Illa duo∣decima die Augusti anno Domini 1613, aetatis 36.

<P>Underneath lies the body of an unfortunate young officer of the name of Montgomery, who was accidentally killed by a fowling-piece, when out on a shooting party near Chester-le-Street, 1773.</P>
<P>Maddison's <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><P>Inscription: "Here rest in christian hope the bodies of Lionel Maddison, son of Row∣land Maddison, of the county of Durham, Esq. and of Jane his wife: she died July 9th, 1611. He having been thrice mayor of this town departed December 6th, 1624, aged 94 years. He lived to see his only son Henry father to a fair and numerous issue. Here inter∣red also are the bodies of Henry Maddison and Elizabeth his wife, daughter of Robert Barker, of this town, who lived together most comfortably 40 years. He was sometime mayor of this town, and having lived in good name and same 60 years, deceased in the true faith of Christ the 14th of July 1634. Elizabeth his only wife had issue by him ten sons, viz. Sir Lionel Maddison, Knight; Ralph, Robert, William, Henry, Peter, George, Timothy, and Thomas: and six daughters; Jane, Susan, Elizabeth, Barbara, Eleanor, and Jane: all the sons at his death were living but John, who died in his expedition to Cadiz. She lived his widow 19 years; died 1653."</P>
<P>Underneath the sixteen smaller statues, representing the 16 children of Henry and Eli∣zabeth Maddison, is a beautiful series of small shields, pointing out their intermarriages, as follow: 1. Tempest impaling Maddison, for Jane, who married William Tempest, Esq. —2. Lozenge shield, for Susan, who must have died unmarried. 3. Bewick impaling Maddison, for Elizabeth, who married William Bewick. 4. Lozenge shield, for Barbara, who died unmarried.</P>
<P N="5">5. Bowes impaling Maddison, for Eleanor, who married Mr. Francis Bowes. See St. Nicholas' Register. 6. Jane, it should seem, married a husband who proved no arms, as an empty shield impales the coat of Maddison.</P>
<P N="7">7. and 8. Lionel (afterwards Sir Lionel) and Ralph, the 1st and 2d sons, appear to have married two sisters of the name of Hall—on both shields Maddison impaling Hall.</P>
<P N="9">9. Robert, the 3d son, has married a Draper—Maddison impaling Draper. 10. William has married a Grey—Maddison impaling Grey.—See St. Nicholas' Register of Marriages.</P>
<P N="11">11. Henry must have died unmarried—Maddison's arms alone.</P>
<P N="12">12. Peter, the 6th son, has married a Thonge or Tonge (a Durham family)—Maddi∣son impaling Tonge—as I gathered from Forster's MS. of arms in the possession of Mr. Ralph Waters. 13. George; 14. Timothy; 15. Thomas, must each of them have married a woman of a family that proved no arms—each of the three shields—Mad∣dison impaling an empty shield. 16. John, supposing him the youngest, who died in the expedition to Cadiz, has married one of the Cock family—Maddison impaling Cock. — Below the inscription on the four squares, "Animae super aethera vivunt"—"Decus vitae est honorata mors"—"Beati mortui qui in Domino moriuntur."—"Serius aut citius metam properamus ad unam."—At the top—"Memorare novissima"—and "Me∣moriae sacrum."</P></NOTE> monument, which still remains.</P>

since its first erection—it is assixed to a pillar on the north side of the south isle. At top are the images of Faith, Hope and Charity, with their usual attributes. Below these are the statues of three persons of each sex, in suppliant attitudes, and on their knees. The two on each side of the desk in front are evidently meant for Henry Maddison and Elizabeth his wife, the daughter of Robert Barker.—Above their heads a shield— Maddison impaling Barker—He is represented in the habit of an alder∣man of Newcastle. The two figures behind them on the west side re∣present old Lionel Maddison, also an alderman of that town, who mar∣ried a Seymour.—Above them a shield—Maddison impaling Seymour. The figures on the east side seem intended for Sir Lionel Maddison (knighted by King Charles I. whom he entertained at dinner June 4th, 1633), and his wife, who must have been a Hall—Maddison impaling Hall, on a coat of arms above, with the helmet of a knight, with the crest of Marley, which I find was granted to him, with liberty to quar∣ter the arms of Marley, by Le Neve, norroy king at arms, June 5th, 1635, the crest of Maddison being a lion's head erazed, as it appeared on an adjacent grave-stone. I suppose this Sir Lionel to have erected the monument, having modestly left a compartment without any in∣scription

<HEAD>VICARS OF ST NICHOLAS IN NEWCASTLE UPON TYNE <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot"><P>"The town of Newcastle upon Tyne gives denomination to a deanery within the archdeaconry of Northumberland. The whole town is but one parish—the mother church is that of St. Nicholas, which has three parochial chapels within the walls belonging to it, viz. All-Saints, St. John's, and St. Andrew's, besides two parochial chapels with∣out the town, viz. South-Gosforth and Cramlington in Northumberland. There was formerly another chapel at North-Gosforth, but it is now demolished. The Queen pays the four curates within the town a yearly stipend out of the fee-farm rents, and so does the vicar.</P>
<P>"The vicarage was endowed with all tithes, "decimis garbarum duntaxat exceptis," by the prior and convent of Carlisle, and confirmed by Hugh Pudsey, Bishop of Durham, 1194. The vicarage is in the gift of the Bishop of Carlisle. One half of the corn tithes belongs to the Bishop of Carlisle, and the other to the Dean and Chapter of Carlisle.</P>
<P>"There are three chapels more belonging to the town, which are not parochial, viz. one belonging to St. Thomas' Hospital, another to the Trinity-House, and another to a school in Sandgate. There is no one of all the churches endowed but St. Nicholas's; but such is the generosity of the corporation, that for several years last past they have allowed the clergy of these churches 671l. 13s. 4d. per annum out of the revenue of the town, be∣sides 180l. 13s. 4d. which they give to the schoolmasters and the chaplain of the gaol, which is very generous.

<HEAD>AFTERNOON LECTURERS AT ST. NICHOLAS'S.</HEAD>
<P>WILLIAM PEIRSON occurs A. D. 1604<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot"><P>St. Nicholas' Register, November 1st, 1604—also May, 1604.—Randall's MSS. from a MS. of Dr. Hunter, "written soon after the civil wars," say, "It appears that Peirson, lecturer of this church about the year 1606, was paid quarterly a salary out of the town of Newcastle, and likewise for several years after during his continuance." (See also lecturers of the other churches.) "The salaries were not one and the same, but added and increased as the town thought fit. Upon this first settlement they had those salaries out of the town for preaching in the forenoon, and the parish did contribute for their preaching in the afternoons. Some time after the town of Newcastle made an addition to the former salaries, and gave them an allowance for preaching both forenoon and after∣noon; upon which augmentation the parishes gave no farther contribution. In this state have the lectureships continued ever since, with an alteration still of salaries, more or less as there was occasion, and at the will and pleasure of the patrons. And when any vacancy happened in any of the churches of the town, the mayor, aldermen and common-council of Newcastle from time to time have chosen another in such room and stead, and the Bishop of Durham for the time being did always hitherto allow and approve of, by licence, such person so chosen, being duly qualified.</P>
<P>"Note, the lecturers of St. Nicholas' and All Saints' have this further advantage in it, which makes it the more valuable, that this preferment does no-ways disqualify or inca∣pacitate them from holding other livings with the cure of souls."

<P>In November 1723, the town of Newcastle gave publick notice for all papists to take the oaths of allegiance to his majesty, and for this purpose adjourned the sessions.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>A Mr. Walsh is said to have been priest at the chapel in Gateshead, which was afterwards removed to a house that once belonged to Sir John Marley, the celebrated loyalist, in the street called the Close.</P>
<P>The chapel in the Nuns was removed to a place, the entry to which is near the Black-Horse-Pant, in the Bigg-Market, where Mr. Cordell at present officiates.</P>
<P>The chapel in the Close has also been removed since that time to a house near the foot of West-Gate, at which Mr. Warilow is the present officiating priest.</P>
<P>From the head of the street called the Side, to about the middle of it, there is a very steep descent: this name is plainly derived from the cir∣cumstance of its being erected on the side of a hill. About half-way down it becomes more than double its breadth in the steep descent.
<PB N="330" REF="364"/>
Bourne tells us, that the east side of the wider part was anciently called "Cordiner, or Cordwainer-Rawe <NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot"><P>See the description of Gunner-Tower-Ward.—It is plain from thence that All-Hal∣low-Pant and Cordiner-Place have been near the head of what is now called the Butcher-Bank; as also that the west row of the Side, from Cale-Cross to Painter-Hugh, was called "Flesher-Rawe," <HI>i. e.</HI> Butcher-Row.—The "going downwards," which seems to have missed Bourne, is meant for the descent from All-Saints' church to the Cale-Cross.</P>
<P>The following entry occurs in the Harleian MSS. 708, eschaets 1 Ric. II. "Andreas de Tyndale fuit seisit' die quo obiit de una shopa in villa Novi Castri super Tynam in le Fleshewer-Rawe quam tenuit de Domino Rege in libero burgagio per servicium unius oboli per annum et de una placea terrae vastae in le Coke-Rawe quam tenuit de Rege in li∣bero burgagio per servic' 2d. per annum."</P></NOTE>."</P>
<P>There was a postern, called the Eastern-Postern of the Castle, that communicated by a very narrow and steep flight of steps with the Side, a little above the middle of that street.—See account of the Castle.</P>
<P>A little above, on the opposite side, we descended by a small flight of steps into a short narrow lane, which communicated with the bottom of the street called Painter-Hugh. Bourne supposes that this was an∣ciently called Swinburn-Place <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><P>It must have been somewhere hereabouts.</P>
<P>See account of Pink-Tower-Ward, which included "all the west rawe in the Side unto a great waiste upon the Castel-Hugh sumtime called Olde Laurence Acton's Waiste, now Thomas Heryng's foreanents a pant afore Swinborne's doore upon Lorke-Burne." This too is the pant which Bourne has erroneously called All-Hallow-Pant.</P>
<P>In Corbridge's Plan of Newcastle, 1723, this is called Dog-Loop, <HI>i. e.</HI> Leap.</P></NOTE>. At the north end of this lane there was a place called Pencher-Place <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">It has been conjectured that Pencher-Place means the place of paunch, <HI>i. e.</HI> tripe-women.—Sed quaere? for "Pencher" may have been the sirname of the owner of the property.</NOTE>. He adds, "perhaps the whole lane was called so."</P>
<P>It went up as far as the late Nether-Dean-Bridge <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">See afterwards "Nether-Dean-Bridge."</NOTE>.</P>
<P>"Under this very high and ancient arch," he continues, "I am told the rings are still to be seen that the boats were fastened to, which
<PB N="331" REF="365"/>
brought up the merchant-goods, when the merchants had their shops in the Flesh-Market." This arch was lately taken down.</P>
<P>Lort, or Lork-Burn, up which, for a considerable way, the tide flowed formerly, made a division anciently in the lower part of the Side. This runner of water was covered over with stone, A. D. 1696 <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">"1696. Lort-Burn arched over and paved from the foot of Side-Pant to the Keyside-Wall." —Grey's MSS. quarto, No. 3, dorso.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>On the north side of Lork-Burn, near the Sand-Hill, stood the Cale-Cross <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot"><P>Bourne supposes it to have been called Cale-Cross, because of the cale, or broth, which was sold there in former times: I think much more probably from the herb kail∣wort, which also gave a name to broth in the north.—Bourne adds, "This seems to have been its original name, for I meet with it in the reign of King Richard II. and also in a writing dated in the time of King Edward the Third."</P>
<P>In the confirmation of the Wall-Knowl hospital, A. D. 1360, it is called "Cale-Cross."</P>
<P>In a deed preserved in All-Saints' vestry, dated October 19th, 1319, it is thus mentioned: "In vico qui ducit del Cale-Crosse."</P>
<P>In the common-council books, October 10th, 1653, the name is spelled "Keale-Crosse."</P></NOTE>, which Grey, in his Chorographia, describes as a "fair one, with columns of hewn stone covered with lead."</P>
<P>There was a cistern at the top of it within my remembrance, to hold what was then called the New-Water. It was taken down about No∣vember 1773 <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Newcastle Courant, November 6th, 1773.</NOTE>. It is sometimes, but erroneously, called Scale-Cross.</P>
<P>This cross was rebuilt, A. D. 1783, after a design of Mr. David Stevenson, architect.—The inscription as follows: "Sir Matthew White Ridley, Bart. mayor, Richard Bell, Esq. sheriff." Here conti∣nue to be sold eggs, milk, cheese, butter, &amp;c.</P>
<P>High-Friar-Chare, which leads from Newgate-Street, near the New-Gate, to Pilgrim-Street, has had its name to distinguish it from the other called the Low-Friar-Chare, lower down the street, and commu∣nicating with West-Gate.</P>
<P>Adjoining to this street stood the house of Grey-Friars, or Minors, called also Franciscan-Friars.</P>
<P><PB N="332" REF="366"/>They were one of the most eminent of the four orders of mendicants <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Before persons could be admitted into this order they were obliged to give a convincing proof of the disinterestedness of their motives, by selling all they had and giving it to the poor.</NOTE>.

<P>Their habit was a loose garment reaching to the ancles, with a cowl and a cloak over it when they went abroad—they girded themselves with cords and went barefooted.—Yet it should seem, from the prints in Creccelius's Collectanea, that the Observants only, a rigid branch of the order, had their feet uncovered.</P></NOTE>. Their house in Newcastle is said to have been founded by the Carliols <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Their great estate, according to Leland, went by marriage to the family of the Thur∣gills, of the Wolds in Yorkshire.</NOTE>, wealthy merchants in the time of King Henry III <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot"><P>The site of this house must have been somewhere in the garden of the late Sir Walter Blackett, Bart. most probably in that part of it which lies opposite to Ficket-Tower.</P>
<P>Bourne, from the authority of the Milbank MS. says it stood near Pilgrim-Street Gate, and that there was a little lane between it and the walls.</P>
<P>The High-Friar-Chare must have conducted to it, being styled, in several ancient writings, "Vicus qui ducit ad Fratres Minores."</P>
<P>The burial-ground of the monastery was immediately opposite to Ficket-Tower, as ap∣pears before in the old account of Ficket-Ward.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>Bourne, on the authority of ancient writings, observes that they were a regular and settled body, A. D. 1267.</P>

<P>It was usual for persons of note to be buried among these Grey or Franciscan Friars, and also in the habit of their order.—I found built up in the wall of a house adjoining to the site of the monastery the fragment of a gravestone, which has, no doubt, been taken out of their burial-ground.—A sword is marked on it—the mutilated inscription runs thus: "Hic jacet.... eming." The last, I suppose, has been "Fleming," a name which often occurs anciently among the magistrates of Newcastle.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>Dr. John Scot, usually called Duns Scotus, and the Subtle Doctor, entered the order of Minors in this house before A. D. 1300 <NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Leland, from certain old records of Merton-College in Oxford, gathered that he was born in the parish of Emeldon, in a hamlet or manor place belonging to that college called Dunstan—from whence, by contraction, he got the epithet of Duns.—His father's name was Scot.—The place belongs to Merton-College to this day. He was the son of a tenant of that house.—In one of his MS. works, folio, D. 1. 6. Theolog. are these words: "Explicit lectura doctoris subtilis in universitate Oxoniensi super quartum librum Sententiarum, scilicet, Domini Johannis Duns, nati in quadam villula parochiae de Emyldon vocata Dunstan in comitatu Northumbriae pertinente domui scholarum de Mer∣ton Hall in Oxonia et quondam socii dictae domus." The words "Scotia me genuit" upon his tomb seem to contradict the above account, but Fuller attributes it to an easy mistake of foreigners, considering that Northumberland had anciently comprehended all the lands from Humber to Edinburgh Frith.</NOTE>.</P>

<P><PB N="339" REF="373"/>There was an inn <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot"><P>Perhaps there have been more Pilgrims Inns in this street than one: there seems reason also for supposing, from the following extract, that pilgrims came hither too to visit certain reliques of St. Francis that were preserved in the house of Grey Friars, near the head of this street.—It is from Bale's Life of Hugh of Newcastle, a famous Franciscan of that town: "Hugo de Novo Castro Dunelmensis quoque ditionis alumnus ejus oppidi minoritis a parentibus suis traditus fuit, ut unà cum christianae vitae exemplis bonas imbi∣beret artes. Sed ecce pro vita mors, et pro religione plusquam vanissima omnium qui unquam fuerunt gentilium superstitio. Non in sculptilibus solum ligneis ac lapideis sed in iptissimis idololatriarum omnium sordidissimis fecibus. Francisci nempe perforatis calceis, chordis et braccis: quae parituris statim mulierculis et aliis sibi et suo Francisco de∣votis peregrinis, contrectanda, exosculanda atque summa veneratione in Antichristi reg∣no colenda, devotissimè exhibere solent."</P>
<P>Mention occurs in the Carr MS. A. D. 1564, of the execution of one Partrage, for coining false money in "the greate innes in Pilgrim-Street."</P>
<P>Dr. Ellison's MSS. say, that this house, called the Pilgrim's Inn, was holden of the dean and chapter of Durham, and belonged in his time to Mr. Ralph Ogle.</P>
<P>Bourne describes it as adjoining to the north side of Mr. Edward Collingwood's house, and exactly 116 yards from the southermost corner of Upper-Dean-Bridge: he adds, it is holden of the dean and chapter of Durham, and belongs at present to Mr. James Hargrave.</P>
<P>This appears to have been called St. Cuthbert's Inn in the time of Henry VIII. See the ministers' or bailiffs' accounts of the monastery of Durham, 4th of February, 32 Hen. VIII. remaining in the Augmentation-Office, from whence the following is an extract: "Novum Castrum super Tynam.—Valet in firma unius burgagii ibidem vocat' Seynt Cuthbert's Inne per annum 34s. 8d. jacen' in Pilgramestrete et in parochia Omnium Sanctorum ville predicte."</P>
<P>The last building in this street, to which tradition had continued the name of Pilgrim's Inn, was pulled down a few years ago by its owner Mr. Thomas Barker, merchant, who has built on the site of it a large house to front the street, and converted the back parts of the premises into a starch manufactory. Windows of a very ancient model, thick wall, &amp;c. as also a crucifix of wood, were discovered on pulling down the old building.</P>
<P>In the summer of 1777 I saw at Canterbury a place for similar purposes, where the shoals of pilgrims that went thither to visit the shrine of St. Thomas a Becket, were ac∣customed to lodge, which has undergone little or no alteration in its appearance. Chaucer is said to have often slept in it. See Gostling's Canterbury, p. 57, 63, 64. 2d edition.</P></NOTE> in this street, says Bourne, which the Pilgrims in their journey were wont to call at, which occasioned their constant coming up this street, and so it got its name of Pilgrim-Street, as the inn did that of Pilgrim's Inn.</P>
<P><PB N="340" REF="374"/>The meeting-house of the inoffensive sect called Quakers is in Pil∣grim-Street, nearly opposite to the site of the Pilgrim's Inn.</P>
<P>Adjoining to it is a burying-ground for persons of that denomina∣tion.</P>
<P>In Corbridge's Plan of Newcastle upon Tyne, of the date of 1723, a dissenters meeting-house is marked hereabouts, and not far from the Manor-Chare.</P>
<P>The first place of meeting <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><P>George Fox, in his Journal, p. 281, tells us, that he came to Newcastle upon Tyne in 1657, but meeting with no encouragement, and finding (says he) "we could not have a publick meeting among them, we got a little meeting among friends and friendly peo∣ple at the Gateside; where a meeting is continued at this day in the name of Jesus."— Friend George inveighs with great warmth against the then priests of Newcastle, saying, that "the power of the Lord rose in me to warn them of the day of the Lord that was coming upon them; and not long after all these priests of Newcastle, and their profession, were turned out when the King came in." He adds, "one L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dger, an alderman of the town, was very envious against truth and friends."</P>
<P>I found the following inscription on a stone in a garden belonging to Captain Lampton, near the middle glass-house: "Abigail Tizacke, daughter of John and Sarah Tizacke, departed this life the 7th day of the 12th month, and in the 7th weack of her age, anno 1679."—The "12th month" is an expression for December, which clearly marks the sect to which J. and S. Tizacke belonged.</P></NOTE> which this sect had in the vicinity of Newcastle upon Tyne, was in the street called Pipewell-Gate, in Gateshead, in a house not many years ago the property of a Mr. Swift, who kept a tavern in it, with the sign of the Fountain.</P>
<P>On the same side of Pilgrim-Street, a little higher up, there is kept, at present, a dispensary, which was opened October 2d, 1777 <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Newcastle Courant, October 4th, 1777.</NOTE> for the humane purpose of "administering advice and medicines to the poor confined to their own habitations by sickness."</P>
<P>The corporation of Newcastle subscribed 40l. per annum <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot"><P>September 25th, 1777. Common-council books.—The salary of 50l. per annum, heretofore paid to the town's surgeon, is now lessened to 20l. per annum, "for giving his attendance and assistance to such of the dispensary patients, and others, in this town, as shall require surgical aid, and be recommended by the corporation."</P>
<P>A general meeting of the governors of the dispensary was held on the 29th of September, 1777, when the regulations for the government thereof, &amp;c. were confirmed—John Ba∣ker, Esq. mayor, president.—Newcastle Courant, October 4th, 1777.</P>

charitable institution, which is a very necessary appendix to the infir∣mary.</P>
<P>The limits for visiting patients were appointed as follows: Shield-Road-Bridge to the eastward, and the utmost extent of the town to the west, north, and south. Gateshead to become a district for medical practice, as soon as a sufficient subscription should be raised. John Baker, Esq. was the first president; Lord Ravensworth was afterwards patron.</P>
<P>In November, 1785, the Duke of Northumberland was chosen pa∣tron of this charity.</P>
<P>In September, 1786, the present Duke of Northumberland was elected patron.</P>
<P>Near the head of this street, on the left hand in going up, stands a princely mansion, the main body whereof is said to have been built out of the ruins of the house of the Grey-Friars.—The two wings were added by Sir William Blackett, Bart. whose grand-daughter married its late lamented owner and inhabitant, Sir Walter Blackett, Bart <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot"><P>This house, the view of which, from the street, often called to my remembrance the passage of Virgil, which describes the palace of Anchises:
<Q><L>—"Quanquam secreta parentis</L>
<L>Anchisae domus arboribusque obtecta recessit."—Aeneid, lib. ii. l. 299.</L></Q>
was purchased, with the extensive gardens, &amp;c. around it, A. D. 1783, by Mr. George Anderson, master-builder, of Sir Thomas Blackett, Bart.</P>
<P>There is a bird's eye view of it among Kip's Views, intitled, "The seat of the Hon. Sir William Blackett, Bart. with part of the town of Newcastle upon Tyne."</P>
<P>Grey (and Bourne after him) calls it a princely house, and very stately and magnifi∣cent, being supposed to be the most so of any house in the whole kingdom within a walled town. It is surrounded with a vast quantity of ground.</P>
<P>It is added, "That part of it which faces the street is thrown into walks and grass-plots, beautified with image and beset with trees, which afford a very pleasing shade: the other part of the ground, on the west side of it, is all a garden, exceedingly neat, and curiously adorned with statues, and several other curiosities. But this house is not more remarkable or memorable upon any account than for its having been the lodgings of King Charles I. whilst he was a prisoner at this town."</P>
<P>It appears from Corbridge's Plan, 1723, that the meeting-house of the company of spur∣riers was in an apartment in an old pile of buildings immediately below this house: a view of which is given in that plate by the title of "Mr. Fenwick Lambert's House."—On a stone over one entrance, "Gloria Deo in excelsis."—Over another fronting the street, "De bon vouloir servir le Roi."</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="342" REF="376"/>The alms-houses built by Christopher Brigham, merchant, and after him called Brigham's alms-houses, stood at the head of this street, near the Grey-Friars' House, and almost contiguous to Pilgrim-Street-Gate.</P>
<P>The founder was sheriff of Newcastle A. D. 1495, and mayor A. D. 1504 and 1505.</P>
<P>This place is mentioned as having been inhabited, in the year 1556, by poor religious women. The site of this place is marked in Speed's Plan of Newcastle, A. D. 1610.</P>
<P>Leland mentions this little hospital, which appears by Speed's Plan to have consisted of several houses, occupying all, or most of that space, separated by a little lane near the head of Pilgrim-Street, and then at a right angle turning northward into the High-Friar-Chare. They were bounded on the east and north by Pilgrim-Street and the said Chare <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Mr. Fenwick, town's surveyor, informed me, that within his remembrance there was an old building there, over the door of which was a stone with a Latin inscription.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Between Pilgrim-Street and the town's wall on the east, is a little field <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot"><P>Bourne thus mentions it—"On that side of Pilgrim-Street next the town-wall, is a very agreeable walk, generally frequented in a summer's evening by the gentry of this part of the town." There is a passage into this field from the Manor-Chare, another from Pilgrim-Street-Gate, and a third from behind Surgeons' Hall.</P>

<P>Pilgrim-Street, growing narrower as it approaches to All-Saints church, winds down the hill towards the foot of the Side, taking the name at present of Butcher-Bank, as being chiefly inhabited by persons of that trade, but it was formerly called All-Hallow-Bank <NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">In a deed preserved in All-Saints vestry, dated October 29th, 1319, it is called "vicus qui ducit del Cale-Crosse ad ecclesiam Omnium Sanctorum."</NOTE>.</P>

<HEAD>CHURCH OF ALL-SAINTS, OR ALL-HALLOWS.</HEAD>
<P>THE conjecture of Grey <NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Grey—cited by Bourne.</NOTE>, in his Chorographia, that this church was dedicated to All-Saints, or All-Hallows, from the ancient name of that part of the town, Pampedon, which, he adds, was so called from the Pantheon at Rome, appears to be too ridiculous to deserve either to be considered or refuted.</P>
<P>It is not known at what period this church was built. Bourne met with an account, of the date of 1286, in which it is mentioned as erected at that time <NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot"><P>Bourne.</P>
<P>"This church, seated upon a hill, much about the same height with the situation of St. Mary's in Gateshead, and upon the same line with it, is not so long as St. Nicholas', being only 55 yards 1 foot and ¼ long, but it is broader, as being 25 yards 2 feet in breadth." —Ibid.</P>
<P>"The extent of the parish of All-Saints is as follows: Beginning at Sand-Gate it is bounded by the river to St. Antons, thence to Biker and Biker-Hill, to Arcle-Dean, to Ewsburn, thence to Gesmonde, Sandeford-Stone to the Shield-Field, from whence it crosses the dean and meadows to Over-Dean-Bridge-End, and down to the west side of Pilgrim-Street to the Painter-Hugh, so to the east of the Butter-Cross and Sand-Hill to the Key-Side, so to Sand-Gate."—Warburton's MSS. penes h. v.

He died May 17th, anno 1730, in the 21st year of his age. He was a youth of fine parts, and good learning, a great deal of sweetness of temper and strict religion."</P>
<P>"There is," says Bourne, "in this part of the church a very large stone, insculped with brass, of which several years ago no more could be read than hic tumulatus dono Dei datus mitis clero—promotor ecclesiarum. My authority imagines this to be the burial place of Robert Rhodes. He says the picture upon the stone was very like that of Roger Thorn∣ton; all the difference is, that the gown of this picture is not so deep as that of Thornton's.—He conjectures it to be the burial place of Ro∣bert Rhodes, because of the words promotor ecclesiarum. Lib. All Hall. The words promotor ecclesiarum are not now to be found. However," continues Bourne, "had they been there still, I think they are but a weak argument to prove that Robert Rhodes was buried here, when it is considered that he founded a chantry in St. Nicholas', that his own soul and his wife's might be prayed for. For people were generally buried in the same church, and near the very place, where they erected a chantry or an altar. But whoever it is, this, I think, may be safely concluded from the grandeur of the grave-stone, that he was some wealthy person, and, from his being promotor ecclesiarum, that he was also religious.</P>
<P>"The effigies is very tall, and is surrounded with very curious pictures of the saints and some other things: but the brass is now tearing off, and going very fast into ruin. It is a pity (he adds) there should not be more care taken of it, as it is an ornament to the church, and the monument of its benefactor. The promotors of churches should be always remembered with the most grateful respect, that they may be shining lights to the most distant ages."</P>

<P>"Mr. Nicholas Fenwick (says Bourne) had this stone given him by one Mr. Brandling, who lived at Ipswich, and caused the said inscription to be obliterated: after that he set upon it the arms of the Fenwicks."</P>

<P>"There was (says Bourne) an old stone which lay between the vestry and quire-door, with its inscription erased: it belonged to alderman Leonard Carr, who gave 5l. yearly for ever to the poor of this parish, and appointed it out of divers houses in the Butcher-Bank. He was an alderman of the town before the rebellion, and turned out by the re∣bels. He deserves a better monument."</P>
<P>Opposite to the vestry, on the south side of the altar, was a large stone of that kind called touchstone, raised above the level of the church.
<PB N="382" REF="417"/>
It was covered with brass on the top of it, which has cut on it the effigies of Roger Thornton and his wife, and also the figures of the apostles, and other saints, with the family arms; one of the coats, Bourne says, was the arms of Lumley; sed quaere.</P>

<P>PANDON, or Pampedon, anciently a distinct town from Newcastle, was united thereto by a charter of King Edward I. A. D. 1299 <NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">See History of Newcastle as a corporate town.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Horseley, the learned author of the Britannia Romana <NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot"><P>Britannia Romana, p. 131.</P>
<P>"This place of Pandon," says Grey, in his Chorographia, p. 12, "is of such anti∣quity, that if a man would express any ancient thing, it is a common proverb, "as old as Pandon."</P>
<P>Since Grey's time, the proverb has been corrupted into "as old as Pandon Gate."</P></NOTE>, has conjec∣tured,
<PB N="397" REF="433"/>
with great probability, that the latter syllable of Pandon was deen, a hollow or a brook. No one has hazarded a probable etymon of the first syllable. That the Romans called it Pampedon or Pantheon, from some building like the Pantheon at Rome having stood in it, is an assertion too ridiculous to deserve refutation. I shall mention, in a note, some other conjectures which have been made on this subject, with equal felicity <NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot"><P>Bourne says, that "there is some doubt about the reason of the name, some imagining it came from Pandana, one of the gates of Rome, which was so called, "quia semper pa∣teret," because it stood always open. But I dare say, this could never give name to the town of Pandon, which being in all probability a Roman place of defence, was rather obliged to be always shut."</P>
<P>Others have imagined that it came from one Pandara, a Scottish virgin saint, but for what reason they know best.</P>
<P>In a deed preserved in All-Saints vestry, dated 1541, the name is spelled "Pampdene." And in another, ibid. dat. 4 Ed. VI. "Pampden."</P></NOTE>.</P>

It is the very place in which stand the house, cellars, and malting of Mr. George Hinkster, which are bounded on the west, north, and south, by the King's Street, and on the east by a waste piece of ground of the Lady Goldsburgh, which was formerly called the Stones."</NOTE>. These buildings, the site of which was anciently a hill of sand, were situated between the foot of Manor-Chare, the foot of Silver-Street and Stock-Bridge.</P>
<P>The street near this place, extending from the foot of Silver-Street to the head of the Broad-Chare, still retains the name of Cow-Gate, the ancient appellation of Manor-Chare <NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot"><P>See before account of Manor-Chare.

<P>In Corbridge's Plan of the town, 1723, the continuation of Cow-Gate to the foot of the Manor-Chare is called "Duck-Hill," alias "Stoney-Hill." In Bourne's Plan, "Duck-Hill" in Broad-Chare is that passage of communication between Broad-Chare and Spicer-Lane.</P>
<P>Near the foot of the Manor-Chare, alias Cow-Gate, was a street or place called Ew-Gate, as appears by a deed dated March 5th, 1652, and an indenture dated 20th March, 1719, both relating to the same property, and communicated by Mr. John Stokoe: the last was made between Wolslan Paston, gentleman, and John Sherwood, mason, and de∣scribes the premises as follows: "All that messuage, burgage, or tenement and garth, with the appurtenances, situate, standing and being within the town and county of New∣castle upon Tyne, in a certain street or place there called Ewe-Gate, boundering upon a messuage belonging to Mr. Anderson towards the east, a parcel of ground belonging to the mayor and burgesses, called the Midden-Stead, upon the west part, and extends itself from the said street called Ewe-Gate on the south, to the town's walls backward on the north."</P></NOTE>.</P>

This monastery was at the top of Wall-Knoll.

<P>"It seems to me," says Bourne, "to have this name from the Roman Wall going along it: for the word knoll signifies an hill or eminence, as I gather from the Lord Bishop of London's note in Cambden upon Sevenoke, in Kent, who says, on the east side of it standeth Knowlle, so called because it is seated upon a hill. And Grey says also, positively, that it was part of the Picts' Wall."</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>A few years ago a meeting-house for protestant dissenters was erected on the Wall-Knoll, of which Mr. Richardson was minister.</P>

<P>Their rule was that of St. Austin, with some peculiar constitutions; and they wore white robes, with a red and blue cross upon their breasts.

<HEAD>SUBURBS OF WEST-GATE.</HEAD>
<P>A SMALL runner of water intersecting the road to Carlisle, a few yards westward of the West-Gate, divides the county of Northumber∣land from the county of Newcastle upon Tyne. A gallows stood lately on the Northumberland side of this runner, where a temporary one is
<PB N="420" REF="457"/>
occasionally erected on the same site, for the execution of criminals be∣longing to that county.</P>
<P>The owners of houses in the street without the West-Gate have votes in the election of members of parliament for the county of Northum∣berland. A road branches off here, on the left hand, leading into the Close by the Firth and Infirmary, and another road, turning upon the right hand, conducts to the Town-Moor, &amp;c. past the Warden's Close, which belonged to the monastery of Black-Friars. Bourne, after Grey, tells us, it seems to be called the Warden's Close <NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot"><P>"For," says he, "Grey tells us the warden of Tinmouth had his house, garden, fish∣pond, &amp;c. here;" and adds, "this indeed is not improbable, for the monastery of the Black-Friars was dependant upon the priory of Tinmouth;" and, "there are still the seeming remains of fish-ponds, gardens, &amp;c."—I have to observe upon the above, that, at the entrance to Warden's Close, one may easily discover the remains of a small fort—the other inequalities seem to have been formed by throwing up earth for breast-works, by the Scots, at the siege of the town in 1644. Yet there occurs in Madox's Formulare An∣glicanum, a record, dated July 13th, 1466, which mentions fish-ponds at that time in this place.—It is a lease from John Rokesburgh, prior of the Black-Friars in Newcastle, and the brethren thereof, to William Hays, of a certain great close of theirs, built round with a stone wall, for the term of his life, at the yearly rent of 25 shillings, and allowing him to fix a small leaden pipe, of a bore large enough to admit a wheaten straw, to their aqueduct, running in and through that close, to their monastery, in order to supply his fish-ponds with water, &amp;c.</P>
<P>It appears by the common-council books, July 5th, 1647, that certain referees, for bringing water to Sand-Gate, were appointed to view the conduit at Warden's Close, and take some washers with them to view the water, and report. There is an order ibid. dated July 30th, 1647, to bring water into the town of Newcastle, from the Warden's Close, "there having bene formerly time out of the memory of man a conduit of water att the north end of the Warden's Close, which water had its course and passage into the War∣den's Close, and from thence thro' the Black-Friars, and soe came into this towne."—" Of late years the free passage and conduit hath bene stopped."—</P>
<P>Bourne, speaking of Shoulder of Mutton Close, which he supposes anciently to have been part of the Warden's Close, says, "There is in it a cistern of water which a friend of his imagined supplied the Black Friars;" and adds, "the well belonging to this monastery may proceed from it."—Mr. Bertram Anderson and Mr. Fawcus, senior, informed me that they remembered a reservoir in the Shoulder of Mutton Close, from whence a pipe con∣ducted through the Town-Wall to the Friars, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The publick fountains, which at Newcastle are of a particular construction, having each a small square reservoir before them for retaining the water for the use of horses, or for common domestic purposes, are called pants.</P>
<P>Dr. Thomas Henshaw, in Skinner's Etymology, in verbo, tells us that pond was an∣ciently pronounced pand, which Skinner derives, with great probability, from the Anglo-Saxon, pyndan, to inclose or shut up. I am inclined to suppose that pant is no more than pand, by a very small corruption, meaning a little reservoir or pond. In a deed, dated 1450, relative to the publick fountain in the market-place of Durham, which is of construction similar to those at Newcastle, I find this word used: "Ejusdem fontis caput vulgariter nuncupat' le Pant Head."</P>
<P>The earliest account I have found of aqueducts bringing water into the town of New∣castle, is dated 1349. "Novum Castrum super Tynam—confirmatio pro fabric' piporum ducentium aquam ibidem." Pat. 22 Ed. III. p. 3, m. 16.—(Murray and Aubone MSS.)</P>

<PB N="422" REF="459"/>
to portion off a part thereof for that purpose; upon whose report that they had measured and staked out a plot of ground for the site of the intended hospital, the common-council aforesaid ordered that a lease should be granted in trust for the use above-mentioned, from the Christmas day following for the term of ninety-nine years, under an annual rent of two shillings and six-pence <NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot"><P>Common-council books.</P>

<P>Dec. 4th, 1768, the corporation of Newcastle granted leave for a passage to be made into the street called Gallow-Gate, for the additional convenience of this hospital <NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot"><P>Ibid.</P>

<P>By a charter of King James I. dated June 12th, 1611, the chapel on Tyne-Bridge was incorporated with this hospital: The preamble sets forth, that because the ancient deeds of endowment, &amp;c. of these two places had either been lost or destroyed by time, and some persons were attempting to appropriate their several possessions to their own use, the King therefore united them, and decreed that the hospital of St. Mary Magdalen, and the chapel on Tyne-Bridge, so incorporated, should consist of a master, who was at least to be a master of arts, and three old poor and unmarried burgesses of the town, who should be a body politick in law, have a common seal <NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">The matrices of two seals belonging to this hospital, the one very badly executed, the other of better workmanship considering its antiquity, are still preserved in the archives of the corporation.—See seals, Plate I.

<P><PB N="431" REF="468"/>Bourne supposes that Barras-Bridge was so called from its conduct∣ing to the Barrows, or burying-ground of the Magdalen hospital <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><P>See account of Ficket-Tower-Ward, where the same word occurs, seeming plainly to mean a burying-ground. Bourne supposes the Maudlin-Barrows to be the present "Sick Man's Close;" barrows signifying tumuli, graves and sepulchres.</P>
<P>Bourne tells us, also, that "some have imagined it to be called so from a person of that name, who was its builder, or a benefactor to it." Other accounts, he adds, derive its appellation from the word barracado.—"St. Andrew's church," says the Milbank MS. "is the oldest church in town, because it is next the Barras, which hath been the ancient barracado of the town." It appears by the following quotation from Hearne's edition of the Chronicon of Whethamstede, vol. ii. p. 532, that barriers for the defence of a town were erected in different parts of it: and indeed what would it avail to have it barricaded only in one place? "John de Cella," says that writer, "made abbot of St. Albans A. D. 1195, and who died A. D. 1214, did as follows, amongst other good works: Item bar∣reras illas quas predecessor suus pro defensione ville (Sancti Albani) in diversis illius parti∣bus suis in temporibus erigi jusserat." There is a reference from the word barreras, ex∣plaining it by repagula, barriers. There were such erections also about Newcastle.—See Froisart's Chronicle—Battle of Otterbourn.—See also before in the account of Ever-Tower-Ward, where mention occurs of the barriers beyond Gallow-Gate, without New-Gate, "as men go to the gallows."</P></NOTE>.</P>

<P>A ROAD from Pandon-Gate leads to Shield-Field, and Ouse, or Use-Burn.</P>
<P>Shield-Field was in ancient times a place where the army used to muster <NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">In Burleigh's State Papers, p. 41, mention occurs in a letter, dated June 7th, 1544, of "the moster at Newcastle at a place callide Shellfelde."</NOTE>.

<P>In the common-council books, March 24th, 1658, there occurs a "prohibition of horse-courses in the Shield-Field."</P>
<P>Ibid. March 3d, 1738, and April 10th, 1738, complaints occur that some parts of Shield-Field had lately been inclosed, and that the inhabitants could not recreate themselves therein as usual—upon which complaints the recorder is ordered to be consulted.</P></NOTE>: It is at present become private property <NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">In the Newcastle Courant, February 18th, 1738, and several weeks afterwards, there appeared the following advertisement: "Whereas the ground called Shield-Field has of late been very much damaged, and the hedges thereof broken down, by several persons presuming to trespass upon the same, by riding horses, and using other exercises there: the owners of the said estate do therefore hereby give notice that they intend to prosecute any person or persons who shall for the future presume to commit any trespass upon the said grounds."</NOTE>.</P>

<P>Ouse-Burn is a pretty considerable village, situated on a burn of that name that runs through it, and falls into the Tyne a little below.</P>
<P>The banks of this burn in many places, especially near the village of Heaton <NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">There appears to have been a chapel anciently at Heaton, which in the year 1299 was honoured with the presence of King Edward I. to hear a boy bishop perform the ves∣pers of St. Nicholas therein, on the 7th day of December that year.

I might hazard a conjecture on the true etymon of Pandon, I would define it to mean "the hill of the pand, or pond, or reservoir." See etymology of the word "pant," in the account of Warden's Close in the suburbs of West-Gate.</P>
<P>I shall throw together in this place the several notices I have been able to collect concerning the means used at various periods for sup∣plying the town of Newcastle with one of the chief necessaries of life.</P>

<P>July 26th, 1647, an agreement occurs between the corporation of Newcastle, and Mr. William Gray, concerning water to be conveyed from his conduit in Pandon-Bank, to Sand-Gate. It appears, that part of the waste called the King's Dikes had been granted to him by way of recompense.

<P>August 23d, 1700, the hostmen made an order that the lease for the above ground, which was scaled and executed on the 4th of October <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">From the lease in the book of inrolments in the archives of the corporation of New∣castle.</NOTE> following, should be taken in the name of the governor, wardens, and fraternity of hostmen, for the use and benefit of the keelmen <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Common-council books and hostmen's books.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The charge of this hospital, which was finished A. D. 1701 <NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Dr. Ellison's MSS.</NOTE>, amounted to above two thousand pounds: each keelman paid four∣pence a tide, and twenty persons, five for each quarter, were approved by the hostmen to be stewards or overseers of the keelmen <NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Hostmen's books. The following is Bourne's account of this hospital: "Before we come to the suburbs of Sand-Gate, we must not omit to mention the Keelmen's Hos∣pital: it is situated some distance of the town's wall, between the Carpenters' Town and Sand-Gate. It is a square building, done in the form of monasteries and colleges, having its low walk round it in imitation of cloisters. The area, in the middle of it, is about 83 feet broad, and about 97½ feet long. There are upwards of fifty chambers in it. Who it was built by, may be learned from the inscription above the entrance of it, which is as follows: "The Keelmen's Hospital, built at their own charge, anno Domini, 1701; Matthew White, Esq. governor, Mr. Edward Grey, Mr. Edward Carr, stew∣ards of the hostmen's company for the time being, and trustees for this hospital." I have been told that Dr. Moor, late Bishop of Ely, upon going down the river in the town's barge, with the magistrates, observed it, and made inquiry about it: and being told that it was built by the keelmen themselves (every one allowing towards it a penny a tide), he said, that he had heard of and seen many hospitals the works of rich men, but that was the first he ever saw or heard of, which had been built by the poor. 'Tis a pity that the design of its building is not thoroughly answered, but there are some miscreants who would rather starve in sickness or old age, than not guzzle a penny in their health and youth."</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="452" REF="489"/>January 16th, 1706, there occurs before the House of Commons, a petition from the skippers and keelmen of Newcastle upon Tyne, for leave to bring in a bill for confirming their voluntary agreement, and for constituting the mayor of Newcastle, for the time being, governor of their hospital <NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Journals of the Commons, vol. xv.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>February 4th, 1706, the hostmen made an order to cancel the former agreement for paying in their four-pences per tide, and to detain the money in their own hand, till a steward should be appointed to collect them by their governor and the mayor of Newcastle <NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Hostmen's books.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>July 3d, 1707, a mutiny occurs among the skippers, or keelmen, some of whom had procured an instrument to be drawn up, in con∣tradiction to the above petition to parliament, subscribed by others for obtaining an act for establishing their hospital <NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>January 4th, 1710, a petition was signed by upwards of an hun∣dred skippers, and presented to the hostmen, complaining that the mo∣ney collected for the hospital was partly detained, and partly wasted and misapplied <NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>May 5th, 1710, the keelmen petitioned the hostmen to apply, on their behalf, to obtain an act of parliament for their better regula∣tion <NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="453" REF="490"/>This request was not complied with, the hostmen being of opinion that an act of parliament for their incorporation, or the establishing of the charity formerly paid by their consent, for the relief of such of them as were past their labour, unless it were under "due regulation, or the government thereof in proper hands, with sufficient power rightly to manage and apply the same, would be an entire ruin, not only to them, the hostmen, but also to the corporation of Newcastle, and to the coal trade in general <NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Hostmen's books.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>January 26th, 1712, the hostmen repealed their former order of the 19th of May, 1699, because the money collected in pursuance thereof had not been applied to the purposes for which it had been originally designed, but had lately been spent in encouraging mutinies and dis∣orders among the keelmen, to the great prejudice of trade; and on the 13th of May, 1713, this repeal was confirmed and signed by all the brethren <NOTE N="v" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>March 20th, 1723, the hostmen made an order that the keelmen's charity should be solely under their management and direction <NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>December 4th, 1728, there was an order of the same fraternity, on petition of the keelmen, that no brother should bind any skipper, or keelman, who refused to suffer one penny per tide to be deducted from his wages, towards the support of their own poor <NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>May 16th, 1729, an attestation occurs in the hostmen's books, un∣der the hands of those who inspected the treasurer's accounts for this hospital, when a balance appeared of 200l. 10s. 8d. The keelmen's charity was then, by common consent, laid aside <NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A. D. 1742, the hostmen paid the rent for the ground upon which the keelmen's hospital is erected, to the corporation of Newcastle for forty-two years, amounting to 2l. 2s. <NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>November 7th, 1758, the governor of the hostmen's company ac∣quainted that fraternity with the alarming increase of the poor-rate in All-Saints parish, said to be occasioned by the great number of poor
<PB N="454" REF="491"/>
in Sand-Gate, employed in working the keels on the river, whereupon a committee was chosen to inquire into the matter.</P>
<P>This committee, on their report, did not admit that the increase of the rate was owing chiefly to those poor, for that since the 16th of May, 1729, no collections had been made among the keelmen for the support of their own poor, except some occasional ones in their societies and box-meetings.</P>
<P>This committee farther gave it as their opinion, that if the former practice of collecting four-pence a tide for every keel in the river, ob∣tained by the consent of the skippers and keelmen, were revised and put under proper regulations, justly divided, and consigned to honest hands, a constant and sufficient provision might be raised <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Hostmen's books.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>December 19th, 1758, the hostmen recommended it to the keelmen to make some agreement for the better support of their own poor, and to pay one halfpenny per chalder for each tide. And February 3d, 1759, a committee of hostmen was chosen to consider the proper heads of a bill, after they had collected the sense of the greatest part of the skippers and keelmen on the subject.</P>
<P>Nothing however appears to have been finally agreed upon on this occasion.</P>
<P>February 16th, 1765, the above matter was revived, and the host∣men sent instructions to a lawyer to prepare a proper plan for the fu∣ture establishment of an hospital for the relief of the keelmen: but this design also came to nothing <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>November 26th, 1768, there was a meeting of persons chosen by the keelmen for the above purposes, at which it was resolved to raise a fund, and re-establish the hospital, for the better provision in future of their needy, impotent, and lame poor, by deducting from the wages of every keel's crew one halfpenny for every chaldron of coals <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.</P>

He claimed to be of Bernard Gilpin's line, and had his scutcheon pinned at his coffin." The same authority mentions "Mr. Pleasance as a preacher at Newcastle," also "Mr. Pell," who married Mrs. Ellison, of a great and wealthy family, and died at Newcastle (it appears, by St. Nicholas' register, that he was buried December 6th, 1698).—The above MS. Life of Barnes mentions also the "Bold Mr. Rothwell, commonly called the Apostle of the North." The Lady Bowes, being apprehensive of danger to him from so surly and fierce a people, as he was going to preach amongst: Mr. Rothwell unconcernedly replied: "If I thought I should not meet the devil there, I would not come there.—He and I have been at odds in other places, and I hope we shall not agree there." Such another warrior was this gentleman, who could say with Mr. Alderman Jurdan, who whilst he was in some trouble in the Star-Chamber, and one told him the Lord-Keeper was against him, answered, "He had a greater Lord-Keeper than he—The Lord is my Keeper, I will not be afraid."</P>

<HEAD>GATESHEAD IN THE COUNTY OF DURHAM.</HEAD>
<P>BEDE, in his Church History, mentions a place which he calls "Caprae Caput," which has generally been supposed to mean Gates∣head—quasi the goat's head, from the Romans having an inn <NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot"><P>Hearne, in the preface to his Collection of curious Discourses, p. 28, 29, speaking of Antoninus' "ad Ansam," has these words: "Though this place grew to be eminent and large at last, yet at first it was only one diversorium, or inn, on which there was the sign of the Ansa, by which name, for that reason, the whole station itself was called afterwards, a thing not uncommon to several other places, both in ancient as well as more modern times."</P>
<P>Dr. Stukeley, in his Iter Boreale, p. 69, speaking of Gateshead, says, "I guess this was a fortified town in the times of the Romans, where a ferry was for passage northward; but by reason of the buildings no traces of it are left. I saw several Roman stones here, the recipient parts of their hand-mills."</P>
<P>The doctor supposed that Gateshead was the Gabrocentum of the Notitia, where the second cohort of the Thracians were in garrison, as its name in British imports "goat's head, I suppose, from the sign of some inn." He adds, "A goat's head still stands upon the sign of the Golden Lion."</P>
<P>"Caput loci," according to Kennet's Glossary to his Parochial Antiquities, signifies the end of a place—"ad caput villae," at the end of the town. Quaere, May not "Gatesheved" mean barely "the end of the road?" there having been discovered no traces of a Roman road carried northwards from Newcastle.</P>
<P>If Bede confounded "gate," via, with "goat," capra, which was anciently, and is still, in the vulgar language of the north, pronounced "gate," he would naturally latinize it by "caprae caput," instead of "viae caput."

<P>In the year 1226 mention occurs of an hospital <NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot"><P>There is said to have been a monastery at Gateshead, A. D. 653, if the place called in Bede's Church History "Caprae Caput," must be understood to mean Gateshead, of which one Uttanus was then abbot: but of the foundation, continuance, and destruction of this very ancient house, no other memorials have been preserved. Tanner, in his Notitia Monastica, cites on this occasion Bede, lib. iii. cap. 21. See also Leland's Col∣lectanea, vol. ii. p. 140. "Uttan presbyter' inlustris et abbatis monasterii quod vocatur ad Caprae Caput." Sic Beda scribit: addit autem annotator ejus Doctor Smith in loco: "Caprae Caput hodie Gateshead ubi nulla remanent antiqui monasterii Uttani vestigia. Recentioris quidem pulcherrimam videmus capellam, vix adhuc ruinis succumbentem. Traditio est cellam fuisse sanctimonialium Novocastrensium, licet ejus historiam apud auctores vix inveneris." The place which Dr. Smith alludes to, and which still re∣mains, I take to have been the chapel of the hospital of the Trinity, if it was not the original chapel of that of St. Edmund. The present chapel of St. Edmund's hospital <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Plate, intitled "Statues of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Charles II. and Jame<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</NOTE>, which is situated half a mile farther to the south, is of the very poorest style of architecture, and probably was erected after the obtaining of King James's charter to refound the hospital. St. Edmund's hospital, as shewn before, was among the possessions of the nuns of Newcastle, and thence the tradition mentioned by Doctor Smith may have had its rise. This beautiful old chapel, from the style of its architecture, cannot, I should suppose, be older than the reign of King Henry the Third: and it is observable, that the long <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lips of windows are similar to those at the end of the church of Tinmouth monastery, and those in the Temple church in London.</P>
<P>"It stands," says Grose, who has given <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>view of it, "on the east, or right hand side of the High-Street, leading to Newcastle-Bridge, from which it is distant about half a mile. The west end of it is handsomely ornamented with a number of pointed arche<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and niches, though the inside seems remarkably plain. It consists of a single aisle, 21 paces broad by 26 long. Some steps at the east end, leading to the altar, are still re∣maining: near them is a grave stone, on which is cut a cross, similar to that in the jamb of the church door at Jarrow: it has also the marks of an inlaid border about it, but the brass is gone. The arches of the windows (except those of the east and west ends, which are entirely pointed) are round within, and pointed on the outside. A remarkable orna∣ment is mounted on its east end, on a slender rod, being a small circle chequered by several bars crossing each other at right angles."</P>
<P>This author is mistaken in the account he gives of this place having been set on fire. The Catholic chapel, which, out of a misguided zeal, was set on fire on that occasion, was in a mansion-house adjoining to this ruinous chapel, the ruins of which mansion-house are seen in his view.—He very justly observes, that the entrance, which is through a low, square, stone gate, decorated with pilasters, is seemingly of modern construction. —The site of the house, he adds, with its offices and gardens, occupied about two acres and a half of land.—Towards the east end of it are the ruins of a mansion, which, from the style of its architecture, seems to have been built since the dissolution of the monastery, perhaps out of its materials. This probably was Mr. Riddle's house, alluded to by Bourne.—The gateway is probably of the same age. Grose also confounds the very an∣cient monastery of Uttan and St. Edmund's hospital with this ruin. The former un∣doubtedly perished in those depredations of the Barbarians, when all the religious houses in Northumberland were destroyed.</P></NOTE> at Gateshead,

<HEAD><HI>APPENDIX, P. 50. Anno duodecimo Georgii III. Regis.</HI> An Act to enable the Lord Bishop of Durham, and his successors, to raise a competent sum of money, to be applied for the repairing, improving, or rebuilding, such part of Tyne-Bridge, as belongs to the see of Durham.</HEAD>
<P>WHEREAS the Right Reverend Father in God John Lord Bishop of Durham is intitled, in right of his see, to one-third part of an ancient bridge extending across the river Tyne, between the town of Gateshead, in the county palatine of Durham, and the town and county of the town of Newcastle upon Tyne: and whereas, by the violence and rapidity of a most extraordinary flood, which happened on the seventeenth day of November, one thousand seven hundred and seventy one, in the river of Tyne, the said bridge was very much damaged, broken down in several places, and rendered utterly impassable: and whereas, in order to restore an easy and safe communication between the counties of Durham and Northumberland, it is highly expedient that the said bridge should be rebuilt, or effectually repaired, with all possible expedition: and inasmuch as the necessary repairs of the one-third part of the said bridge, belonging to the said Lord Bishop of Durham in right of his see, and extending from two blue marble or boundary stones, on the south side of the said bridge, to the said town of Gateshead, will be attended with a great expence; and however reasonable or proper it may be, that the entire sum necessary to be appropriated for, and employed in, that useful and necessary work, ought to be raised out of, or secured upon, the revenues and possessions of the said see of Durham, and that the Lord Bishop of Durham for the time being, ought not to bear any greater burthen than shall arise from the interest or annual charge to be paid in respect of the principal money to be raised for the purpose aforesaid; yet the said John Lord Bishop of Durham is consenting that a reasonable and adequate sum of money may be raised by the authority of parliament, by granting an∣nuities for lives, which will not only be speedy and effectual, but may be a method less burthensome to the successors in the said see than to the said John now Lord Bishop of Durham, by the eventual dropping of lives, and the decrease of such temporary charge: wherefore, may it therefore please your Majesty that it may be enacted, and be it enacted by the King's most excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the lords spiritual and temporal, and commons, in this present parliament assembled,
<PB N="543" REF="578"/>
and by the authority of the same, that the chancellor of the bishoprick and county pa∣latine of Durham and Sadberge, the sheriff of the county palatine of Durham and Sadberge, the vicar-general and principal official of the diocese of Durham, the attorney and solicitor-general to the Lord Bishop of Durham, the principal register or registrar of the diocese of Durham, the auditor to the Lord Bishop of Durham, the keeper of Auckland-castle, the steward of the halmote courts of the Lord Bishop of Durham, the clerk of the halmote courts of the Lord Bishop of Durham, the clerk of the great receipt of the exchequer of Durham, the register of the court of chancery of Durham, the clerk of the chancery of Durham, and the keeper of the rolls of the chancery aforesaid, the clerk of the itinerant justices, and other justices whomsoever in the county palatine of Durham and Sadberge, and the bailiff of the borough of Auckland for the time being, shall be, and they are hereby appointed trustees for putting this act in execution, by and under the direction of the said John Lord Bishop of Durham, and his successors.</P>
<P>Provided always, and be it enacted, that no person shall be capable of acting as a trustee in the execution of this act, during the time he shall hold any office or appoint∣ment, to which any salary or pecuniary profit shall be annexed, by virtue or in pursu∣ance of this act; nor shall any such trustee, on his own private account, enter into any contract, or have any share or interest in any contract, relating to the execution of any of the powers contained in this act.</P>
<P>And whereas it may be necessary to open a more convenient avenue and passage to that part of the said bridge which belongs to the said see of Durham, and to remove the erections and buildings on the same, be it therefore enacted, that the said trustees, or any three or more of them, shall, and they are hereby authorised, by and under such direction of the said Lord Bishop of Durham, and his successors, as aforesaid, to treat, contract, and agree with any person or persons, for the absolute purchase of any estate or interest in any buildings or ground, which shall be deemed necessary to be ap∣propriated, for the better and more effectually repairing, rebuilding, or improving, such part of the said bridge as belongs to the said see of Durham, and for making more convenient the avenue and passage leading on the same, or to appropriate any building or ground which the said bishop is intitled unto in right of his see, for the pur∣poses aforesaid.</P>
<P>And, forasmuch as the raising an adequate sum of money upon the credit of this act, by granting annuities for lives, will be a speedy and effectual method of carrying the intentions of the said John Lord Bishop of Durham into complete execution; be it therefore further enacted by the authority aforesaid, that it shall and may be lawful to and for any person or persons to contribute, advance, and pay, to such treasurer or treasurers as the said John Lord Bishop of Durham, or his successors, shall, in manner herein∣after mentioned, authorise and impower to receive the same, for the uses herein-after expressed, any sum or sums of money, not exceeding in the whole the sum of twelve thousand pounds, for the absolute purchase of twelve or more annuities for lives, to be paid and payable, and the same are hereby directed to continue and be paid, during the full term of the natural life of each such contributor respectively, or the natural life of such other person as shall be nominated by or on the behalf of each contributor respectively, at the time of payment of their respective purchase or contribution-money; which an∣nuity or annuities shall not respectively exceed the rate of ten pounds per annum for every one hundred pounds advanced and actually paid, and so in proportion for any greater or less sum so to be advanced and paid as aforesaid; and the said several an∣nuities, so to be purchased, shall be charged upon, and be paid and payable out of the rents, revenues, and profits, of the said see, which from time to time, during the con∣tinuance of the said annuities, or any of them, shall be received by the said John

<P>Provided always, and it is hereby further enacted and declared, that, previous to the sale of such annuities, in order to raise the said sum of twelve thousand pounds, or any part thereof, one calendar month's notice at the least shall, four or more different days, be given in the London Gazette, expressing the intention of the sale of such an∣nuity or annuities, so as to raise the said sum of twelve thousand pounds, or any part thereof, in order that any person may have an opportunity to deliver in proposals for what annual income or payment <HI>per centum</HI> they are willing to advance their money; and the said trustees, or any three or more of them, shall (if the said Lord Bishop of Durham, or his successors, shall think any such proposals reasonable) give the pre∣ference to the lowest proposer, regard being had to the circumstances of age and health; and the said annuities shall be sold by the said trustees, or any three or more of them, subject to the approbation of the said Lord Bishop of Durham, to be signified by any writing under his hand, to the best advantage they can.</P>
<P>And, for the more effectual securing to the said annuitants the regular and full pay∣ment of their respective annuities, be it further enacted, that the said several annuities shall be also charged upon and issuing out of, and the same are hereby charged upon and directed to be issued out of all or any such part of the temporalities and possessions belonging to the said see of Durham, as shall, from time to time, and at any time hereafter, during the life or lives of any such annuitant or annuitants, be held in de∣mesne, or be in the immediate possession or holding of the said John Lord Bishop of Durham, or his successors: and if it shall happen that the said several annuities, or any of them, or any part thereof respectively, shall be behind and unpaid for twenty-one days after any of the feasts or days which shall be limited and appointed for pay∣ment thereof; then, and so often, and from time to time as it shall so happen, it shall and may be lawful to and for the said annuitants, or persons intitled to such annuities respectively, and his and their respective executors, administrators, and assigns, into

<HEAD><HI>APPENDIX, P. 52. (No. 1.) Anno decimo nono Georgii III. Regis.</HI> An Act for enlarging the term of an act, passed in the twelfth year of his present Majesty's reign, for building a temporary bridge over the river Tyne, between the town of New castle upon Tyne and Gateshead, in the county of Durham; for completing the new stone bridge over the said river; and for making the avenues to, and the passage over the same more commodious.</HEAD>
<P>WHEREAS the ancient stone bridge extending across the river Tyne, between the town and county of the town of Newcastle upon Tyne, and the town of Gateshead, in the county of Durham, wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, in November, one thousand seven hundred and seventy-one, by the violence and rapidity of a most extraordinary stood, very much damaged, broken down in several places, and rendered utterly impassable: and there<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> one third part of the bridge between the said towns belong to the se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Durham, and the other two third parts to the corporation of Ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>castle: and whereas, in the twelfth year of the reign of his present <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n act was passed for building a temporary bridge over the said river; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Newcastle having proposed to exp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd
<PB N="558" REF="593"/>
the sum of two thousand four hundred pounds of their own money towards the expence of building such temporary bridge, and purchasing houses and ground in Newcastle and Gateshead aforesaid, for making a road to such temporary bridge, power was given to the mayor, aldermen, and common council, of the said town and county to build the said bridge, and maintain and support the same when built, and for that purpose to ap∣point a committee to transact such matters as they might find necessary: and whereas by the said act it was enacted, that the said temporary bridge should continue only for the term of seven years, from the twenty-fourth day of June, one thousand seven hundred and seventy-two; and that for reimbursing the said mayor, aldermen, and common council, all such sums as by them should be laid out for the purposes in the said act mentioned, over and above the said sum of two thousand four hundred pounds, it should be lawful for them to take certain tolls for passage over the said temporary bridge: and whereas it was apprehended, at the time of passing the said act, that a new stone bridge might be built, or the old stone bridge effectually repaired, in less time than seven years from the said twenty-fourth day of June; but it having since been sound necessary to take down four arches of that part of the said bridge which belongs to the said cor∣poration (which at the time of passing the said act were deemed sit to be left standing), the building of the new stone bridge has been retarded, and the same cannot be com∣pleted in less than three years from this time: and whereas, when the old stone bridge was destroyed by a flood as before mentioned, there were standing on that part thereof which belongs to the corporation of Newcastle, divers houses, shops, and other build∣ings, which greatly incommoded the passage along the said bridge; all which have been purchased by the said corporation at a very considerable expence, in order to prevent the publick being incommoded thereby; and whereas the Lord Bishop of Durham, and the said corporation, have respectively proceeded to build a new stone bridge in the place where the old bridge stood; and the said corporation had, on the twenty-ninth day of December, one thousand seven hundred and seventy-eight, expended of their own proper money in building their part of the same, the sum of twenty-one thousand and forty-two pounds, sixteen shillings, and eleven-pence, including one thousand eight hundred and thirty-eight pounds, nine shillings, and eight-pence, the price of the buildings on the old bridge; and have, since that time, incurred further expences in carrying on the same: and whereas, upon a moderate computation, the said corporation must expend the further sum of ten thousand pounds in completing that part of the said bridge which belongs to them: and whereas the said corporation had expended, on the said twenty-ninth day of December, one thousand seven hundred and seventy-eight, over and above the said sum of two thousand four hundred pounds, in and about the purposes of the said recited act, for building a temporary bridge, the sum of three hundred and twenty-one pounds, eighteen shillings, and nine-pence, more than the tolls taken upon the said temporary bridge had produced; and it is apprehended that the tolls taken, and to be taken thereupon, from the twenty-seventh day of December, one thousand seven hundred and seventy eight, to the twenty-fourth day of June, one thousand seven hundred and seventy-nine, and not produce so much money a will be sufficient to reimburse the said corporation the said sum of three hundred and twenty-one pounds, eighteen shillings, and nine-pence, and the necessary expences of repair∣ing, preserving, and supporting, the said temporary bridge to the said twenty-fourth day of June: and whereas the said temporary bridge is liable to great damage from floods and ice in the river, and also from keels loaded with coals passing through the same; and it will be of publick utility that the same temporary bridge should be sup∣ported till the said new stone bridge shall be built: and whereas, at the time the said bridge was destroyed by a flood, there were standing on that part thereof which belong, to the see of Durham, divers houses, shops, and other buildings, which greatly incom∣moded

the passage over the same: and whereas the avenue and passage to the said new bridge, at both ends thereof, are the same as were to the old bridge, and are very nar∣row; and it would be of publick utility to open more convenient avenues and passages thereto; and also if the see of Durham was restrained from erecting, or permitting to be erected, any houses, shops, or other buildings, on that part of the said new-bridge which belongs to the said see: may it therefore please your Majesty that it may be enacted; and be it enacted by the King's most excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the lords spiritual and temporal, and commons, in this present parlia∣ment assembled, and by the authority of the same, that, from and after the twenty-fourth day of June, one thousand seven hundred and seventy-nine, Sir Lancelot All-good, James Allgood, Gawen Aynsley, Andrew Armstrong, clerk, R Alnwick, William Atkinson, John Askew, Henry Atkinson, John Atkinson, John Atkinson of Gateshead, Joseph Addison, Ralph Atkinson, Giles Alcock, Alexander Adams, Tho∣mas Adams, Edward Anderson of Newcastle, Charles Atkinson, William Anderson, Bartholomew Anderson, George Anderson, John Anderson, John Andrew, Henry Askew, David Akenhead, Thomas Anderson, Cuthbert Adamson, William Ambler, William Archer, James Allan, Jonathan Airey, Henry Airey, Michael Atkinson, Jo∣seph Airey, James Atkinson, William Ainsley, the honourable George Bennett, the honourable William Byron, clerk, Sir Edward Blackett, baronet, Sir Thomas Blackett, baronet, Sir Francis Blake, baronet, Andrew Robinson Bowes, Ralph Bates, George Baker, William Bainbridge of Riding, John Brand, William Barnup, Thomas Bon∣ner, Bryan Burrell of Broom-Park, George Baker, John Baker of West-Denton, Mat∣thew Bell of Wissington, Matthew Bell, junior, John Bell, Martin Barber, J.

<HEAD><HI>APPENDIX, P. 52. (No. 2.)</HI> An Act for enlarging the terms and powers of two acts of the twelfth and nineteenth years of his present Majesty's reign, made for building a temporary bridge, and completing a new stone bridge, over the river Tyne, between the town of Newcastle upon Tyne and Gates∣head, in the county of Durham, and making the avenues to and the passages over the same more commodious; and for removing and preventing nuisances and annoyances in the streets, lanes, or avenues leading to the said new stone bridge, within the town of Gateshead, in the county of Durham.</HEAD>
<P>WHEREAS an act of parliament passed in the twelfth year of his present Majesty's reign, for building a temporary bridge over the river Tyne, between the town of Newcastle upon Tyne and Gateshead, in the county of Durham, which temporary bridge was to have continuance from the twenty-fourth day of June one thousand seven hundred and seventy-two, for the term of seven years; and in the nineteenth year of his present Majesty's reign, another act of parliament passed, whereby the said tempo∣rary bridge was continued for the further term of three years, and divers persons therein named were appointed trustees for putting the said last-mentioned act into execution, and were enabled to complete the new stone bridge over the said river, and to make the avenues to, and the passage over, the said new stone bridge more commodious; and it was thereby enacted, that for and towards raising money for the purposes of the said act, it should be lawful for the said trustees to take and receive such and the same tolls for the passage of cattle, carriages, and other things over the said new stone bridge, as by the said first-mentioned act were authorized to be taken on the said temporary bridge, until the expiration of twelve years, to be computed from the twenty-fourth day of June one thousand seven hundred and seventy-nine, or until such sooner time as the several purposes of the said act of the nineteenth year of his present Majesty's reign should be carried into execution, and the money borrowed upon the credit thereof, with interest, should be repayed; and it was provided and declared, by the said last-mentioned act, that the improvement of the avenues to the said new stone bridge should end at the messuages and premises, then late Oliphant's, at the south abutment of the said new stone bridge:</P>
<P>And whereas the said trustees have duly put the said act in execution, and have, by the money arising from the said tolls and borrowed on the credit thereof, made and opened such avenues, and completed such other works within the limits prescribed by the said last-mentioned act, as were adjudged necessary for the safety and accommodation of the public; but the south avenue to the said new stone bridge, beyond the premises late Oliphant's, in the town of Gateshead aforesaid, is inconvenient and dangerous to passen∣gers, by reason of the great declivity of the street there, called the Bottlebank, over which the high road leading from the city of Durham to the said bridge lies, though the same is capable of being rendered both safe and commodious:</P>
<P>And whereas it will be of great public utility to effect the improvement of the said south avenue to the said bridge; but in regard that the said trustees appointed by the said act of the nineteenth year of his present Majesty's reign, are thereby restrained from making any improvement beyond the said premises late Oliphant's, and such intended improvements of the said south avenue cannot be effectually made, unless the said tolls are further continued, and the terms and powers of both the said acts enlarged: May it therefore please your Majesty, that it may be enacted, and be it enacted, by the King's most excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the lords spiritual and
<PB N="575" REF="610"/>
temporal, and commons, in this present parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, that the term of twelve years granted by the said last-mentioned act shall be, and the same is hereby declared to be, enlarged and continued for the further term of twelve years, to be reckoned and computed from the expiration of the said term of twelve years.</P>
<P>And, in order that the several powers and authorities, necessary to be exercised in effect∣ing the several purposes herein mentioned, may be the better understood and more easily executed, be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, that instead of the several clauses, provisions, powers, tolls, penalties, forfeitures, matters, and things, which are contained in the said former acts of the twelfth and nineteenth years of his present Majesty's reign, this present act of parliament and the several clauses, provisions, powers, tolls, penalties, forfeitures, matters, and things herein contained, shall commence and take place, and shall be put in execution immediately after passing this act; and the same shall from thenceforth be and continue in force for and during the residue and re∣mainder of the said term of twelve years, granted by the said act of the nineteenth year of his present Majesty's reign; and from and after the expiration thereof, for and during the further term of twelve years, for the purpose of improving the said south avenue to the said new stone bridge, according to the true intent and meaning of this act.</P>
<P>And, in order to secure the money now due and owing on the credit of the said for∣mer acts, or either of them, be it further enacted and declared by the authority afore∣said, that from and after the passing of this act, this act and the several tolls hereinafter granted and made payable, shall, for and during the residue of the said term of twelve years already granted as aforesaid, and also for and during the said additional term of twelve years hereby granted and continued, be and remain subject and liable to the payment of all sums of money, which at the time of passing this act shall be due and owing on the credit of the said former acts, or either of them, and to the payment of all sums of mo∣ney which shall or may hereafter be borrowed on the credit of this present act, together with all interest then due, and which shall or may from time to time hereafter become due and payable for the same respectively.</P>
<P>And, in order to carry the purposes of this act into execution, be it further enacted, that the several persons named and appointed in and by the said act of the nineteenth year of his present Majesty's reign, trustees for putting the same act in execution, and also every other person elected or appointed trustee under the power in the same act contained for that purpose, and also the several persons named and appointed in and by an act of parliament made and passed in the thirteenth year of the reign of his present Majesty, intituled, <Q>An Act for enlarging the term and powers of two acts of the twen∣tieth and twenty-sixth years of the reign of his late Majesty, for repairing the high road leading from the city of Durham, in the county of Durham, to Tyne Bridge in the said county;</Q> and also every other person elected or appointed trustee under the power in the same last mentioned act contained, shall be, and they and their successors to be elected in manner hereinafter prescribed, are hereby appointed trustees for effect∣ing the purposes of this act, and shall have full power and authority, and are hereby enabled to widen and enlarge the said street called The Bottlebank, by pulling down so much of the houses and buildings on the east side of the said street, and laying the scites thereof into the said street, as will make the said Bottlebank there full forty feet wide from house to house, as far southwards from the said new stone bridge as the street or lane called Hillgate; and from thence to make and open a new street fifty feet wide to extend to the west corner of Gateshead church-yard, and then along by the west side of Gateshead church yard wall to a street or lane called High Church Chair; and from the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> towards the Bottlebank aforesaid, to within eighty feet from the said Bottlebank; and from thence to extend in a line on the north side of the said intended street to the

D. 1774.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WHEREAS the Reverend Richard Fawcett, doctor in divinity, is vicar of the vicar∣age and parish church of St. Nicholas, in the town and county of the town of New∣castle upon Tyne, in the diocese of Durham; and the right Reverend Edmund Lord Bishop of Carlisle, in right of his church and see of Carlisle, is patron of the said vicarage:</P>
<P>And whereas the said Richard Fawcett, in right of his said vicarage, is seised of a parcel of ground situate in the said town, bounding upon a street there called Westgate-Street, on or towards the south; upon a parcel of ground belonging to John Ward, Esquire, on or towards the west; and upon certain yards or gardens belonging to divers other persons, on or towards the north:</P>
<P>And whereas the western part of the said ground belonging to the said vicar, is, in its present state, of little or no use to the said vicarage; but is conveniently situated for building upon:</P>
<P>And whereas William Lowes, of the town and county of the town of Newcastle upon Tyne aforesaid, Esquire, is willing and desirous to take a lease of part of the said vicar∣age ground; that is to say, forty-two yards thereof in breadth, eastward from the said ground belonging to the said John Ward, Esquire; and seventy-nine yards thereof in length, northwards from the said street called Westgate-Street, for the purpose of build∣ing upon:</P>
<P>And whereas the leasing of the said quantity of vicarage land for such purpose, will be a manifest advantage to the said vicarage; and the Right Reverend John Lord Bishop of Durham, the ordinary of the same vicarage, and the said Lord Bishop of Carlisle, the patron of the said vicarage, are consenting thereto; but as such lease cannot be made ef∣fectual without the authority of parliament, May it please your Majesty, that it may be enacted; and be it enacted by the King's most excellent Majesty, by and with the ad∣vice and consent of the lords spiritual and temporal, and commons, in this present par∣liament assembled, and by the authority of the same, that from and after the passing of this act it shall be lawful for the vicar of the said vicarage and parish church of Saint Ni∣cholas, in the town and county of the town of Newcastle upon Tyne aforesaid, for the time being, by indenture duly executed, with the consent and approbation of the Lord Bishop of Durham for the time being, and the Lord Bishop of Carlisle for the time be∣ing, testified by their being parties to and executing such indenture, at the costs and charges of the said William Lowes, his executors or administrators, to grant, bargain, sell, and demise a part of the said vicarage ground; that is to say, forty-two yards thereof in breadth, eastward from the ground of the said John Ward, Esquire and twenty-nine yards thereof in length, northwards from the said street called Westgate-Street, to the said William Lowes, his executors, administrator, and assigns, for a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of nine hundred and ninety-nine years, to commence from the feast of the Annun∣ciation of the Blessed Virgin Mary, in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and seventy four, with full and free liberty to the said William Lowes, his executors, administrators, and assigns, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and build a house or houses, or other edifices, thereon; so as the said indenture of demise be, within six months from the date thereof, in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in his Majesty's high court of Chancery, and there be thereby reserved a ground∣rent

of twenty pounds per annum, of lawful money of Great Britain, free and clear of and from all and all manner of parliamentary, parochial, and other taxes, rates, charges, assessments, and deductions whatsoever, imposed, or hereafter to be imposed upon the said piece or parcel of ground, or the house or houses, or other edifices thereupon to be erected and built, or upon the said rent so to be reserved for the same, as aforesaid, by authority of parliament, or otherwise howsoever, for the benefit of the said vicar and his successors, to be paid to the vicar of the said vicarage for the time being, at or within the south porch of the parish church of Saint Nicholas aforesaid, by equal half yearly payments, on the feast of the Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin Mary, and of Saint Michael the Archangel, in every year; the first payment thereof to begin and be made at and upon such of the said feasts as shall next happen after the day of the date of the said indenture of demise; so as the said William Lowes, or his executors or administra∣tors, or the lessee to be named in such indenture of demise, thereby covenant with the said vicar and his successors, with all convenient speed, at his or their own proper costs and charges, to erect and build a good and substantial boundary wall, of brick, of the height of nine feet at least, at the east extremity of the said ground to be so granted and demised, which boundary wall shall extend from the said street called Westgate-Street, in a direct line, to the north boundary of the said vicarage ground; and also, during the said term of nine hundred and ninety-nine years, to keep in good and suffi∣cient repair the said boundary wall so to be erected and built, and likewise all or so much of the walls adjoining to the ground of the said John Ward, and the grounds of the several other persons adjoining to the premises so to be demised, as the vicar of the said vicarage for the time being is bound to keep in repair; and so as in such indenture of demise there be contained a power of entry for non-payment of the said rent thereby to be reserved, and for the non-performance of all or any of the covenants therein to be contained, and also all such other powers and remedies, covenants, provisoes, and agreements as shall be thought necessary and proper by the Lord Bishop of Durham and the Lord Bishop of Carlisle, parties consenting to such demise as aforesaid.</P>
<P>And it is hereby declared and enacted by the authority aforesaid, that the said lease, to be made in pursuance of this act, shall be good, valid, and effectual in law to all in∣tents and purposes.</P>
<P>Saving always to the King's most excellent Majesty, his heirs and successors, and to all and every person and persons, bodies politic and corporate, his, her, or their heirs, successors, executors, or administrators, other than and except the said Lord Bishop of Durham, the ordinary of the said vicarage, and his successors, and the said Lord Bi∣shop of Carlisle, as patron of the said vicarage, and his successors, and the said Richard Fawcett and his successors, vicars of the said vicarage, all such estate, right, title, in∣rerest, claim, and demand, of, in, and out of the said part of the said vicarage ground so to be demised as aforesaid, as they, every or any of them respectively had before the passing of this act, or could or might have had, held, and enjoyed in case this act had not been made.</P>

<P><PB N="602" REF="637"/>Draiton, in the 29th song of his Polyolbion, thus introduces a poetical description of the Roman Wall:
<Q><L>"But Picts-Wall all this while, as though he had been lost,</L>
<L>Not mentioned by the muse, began to fret and fume,</L>
<L>That ev'ry petty brooke thus proudly should presume</L>
<L>To talke: and he whom first the Romans did invent,</L>
<L>And of their greatnesse yet, the long'st-liv'd monument,</L>
<L>Should thus be over-trod; wherefore his wrong to wreake,</L>
<L>In their proud presence thus, doth aged Picts-Wall speake.</L>
<L>He thinks that Offa's ditch in Cambria should not dare</L>
<L>To think himself my match, who with such cost and care</L>
<L>The Romans did erect, and for my safeguard set</L>
<L>Their legions, from my spoyle the proling Pict to let,</L>
<L>That often inroads made, our earth from them to win,</L>
<L>By Adrian beaten back, so he to keepe them in,</L>
<L>To sea from east to west, begun me first a wall</L>
<L>Of eighty miles in length, 'twixt Tyne and Eden's fall;</L>
<L>Long making me they were and long did me maintaine.</L>
<L>Nor yet that trench which tracts the western Wiltshire plaine</L>
<L>Of Woden, Wansdyke call'd, should paralell with me,</L>
<L>Comparing our descents, which shall appeare to be</L>
<L>Mere upstarts, basely borne; for when I was in hand,</L>
<L>The Saxon had not then set foot upon the land,</L>
<L>Till my declining age and after many a yeare</L>
<L>Of whose poore petty Kings those the small labours were,</L>
<L>That on Newmarket Heath, made up as though but now,</L>
<L>Who for the Devil's worke the vulgar dare avow,</L>
<L>Tradition telling none, who truly it began,</L>
<L>Where many a reverent booke can tell you of my man,</L>
<L>And when I first decayed, Severus going on</L>
<L>What Adrian built of turfe, he builded new of stone;</L>
<L>And after many a time, the Britans me repayr'd,</L>
<L>To keepe me still in plight, nor cost they ever spar'd.</L>
<L>Townes stood upon my length, where garrisons were laid,</L>
<L>Their limits to defend; and for my greater aid,</L>
<L>With turrets I was built, where sentinels were plac'd,</L>
<L>To watch upon the Pict; so me my makers grac'd,</L>
<L>With hollow pipes of brasse, along me still they went,</L>
<L>By which they in one fort still to another sent,</L>
<L>By speaking in the same, to tell them what to doe,</L>
<L>And soe from sea to sea could I be whispered through:</L>
<L>Upon my thicknesse three march'd eas'ly breast to breast,</L>
<L>Twelve foot was I in height, such glory I possest.</L>
<L>Old Picts-Wall with much pride thus finishing his plea,</L>
<L>Had in his utmost course attained the eastern sea."</L></Q></P>
<P>During my residence at Newcastle upon Tyne, prompted by an ardour of curiosity bordering on enthusiasm, I occasionally made several excursions to examine the still re∣maining vestiges of those stupendous works, raised here by a people who were justly styled the conquerors of the world, for the great purpose of protecting in their posses∣sions
<PB N="603" REF="638"/>
their civilized subjects, and to ward off the attacks of the more northern and un∣conquered barbarians.</P>
<P>Agricola appears to have suggested the first idea of building these, by erecting A. D. 79 <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">See Horsley's Britannia Romana.</NOTE> a row of sorts across the island from Tinmouth <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">The late discovery of a Roman altar and tablet in the foundations of the ancient Christian church there seems clearly to evince that Tinmouth has been one of their stations.—See vol. ii. p. 65, of this work —And ibid. p. 90, that there has been anoth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r at East Chirton, called "Blake Chestres" in the year 13<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>0. —It is still, however, certain, that neith<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r of the walls extended as far as Tinmouth; Hadrian's having terminated at Newcastle upon Tyne, and that of Severu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> at the old village of Wall's End, about three miles to the east of Newcastle.</NOTE> on the German Ocean to the Irish Sea.</P>
<P>To connect these, the emperor Hadrian <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><P>That Hadrian was the first that built <HI>a wal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> here, we have the express testimony of a Roman historian in the following words: "Britanniam petrit in qua multa correxit, <HI>m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> que per o toginta millia passuum <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> qui barbaros Romanosque divideret."—Spartiani Vita Hadriani, Script. Hist. August. p. 51.</P>
<P>Hadrian's <HI>Vallum,</HI> as it is also called, appears to have been a <HI>turf</HI> wall, with a deep foss or ditch accompa∣nying it on the north side. There was another, called by Horsley the South Agger, at the distance of about five paces to the south of it, as also another and larger agger on the north side of the ditch, which the same writer supposes to have been the military way to this work, as it had been before to the pretentura of stations. These four works, it is very observable, keep all the way a constant regular parallelism one to another. The same writer acknowledges, that there is no determining with certainty what was the ori∣ginal height of this mud wall and its aggers; of which he conjectures the southern one to have been for an inner defence in case they should be beaten from the principal work, or to protect the soldiers against any sudden attack from the provincial Britons.—See Britannia Romana, p. 117.</P>
<P>Though <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arus</HI> and <HI>vallum</HI> are sometimes promiscuously used, yet vallum rather signifies an agger of earth, in which sense it plainly occurs in Caesar's Comm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="7 letters" DISP="〈7 letters〉"/> in the following passage:</P>
<P>"Valio pedum 11 et fossa pedum 15 hiberna cin runt."—De B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lio Gallico, lib. v. c. 31.</P></NOTE> first in the year 120, and afterwards Severus <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><P>Severus' Wall, built of square stones, and every where ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>on the edges of precipices accompanied by a deep ditch or foss, was, according to Bede, who mur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> hav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>en it in perfection, eight feet in breadth and twelve in height.—The breadth of it appears to vary a little in several places of the present remain.

I found the fragment of a column, of which Dr. Stukeley saw several in his time. Altars still lie scattered about in great abundance on Chapel-Hill and the adjacent meadow.

The Ger∣mans paid much regard to this sort of women; and it seems plain from a passage in Ta∣citus, that the Britons had also these female enthusiasts.—See Horsley, ut supra, p. 201.</P>

<P>"PILGRIM-STREET," says Bourne, p. 81, "got its name from the pilgrims, who came from all parts of this kingdom to worship at our Lady's chapel at Gesmond."</P>
<P>"Gesmond or Jesumunde," he adds, "or as it is called in some ancient writings, Je∣sumuth, is a pleasant village, on the north-east of Newcastle, distant from it about two miles; it appertained to the barony of Robert de Gaugy, as appears by a certificate given in the 3d of Hen. III. of such manours as his barony did consist of, for which he was obliged to the service of three knights' fees.—Mag. Brit. vol. iii. Adamus de Athol, who lies buried in the chapel of the Holy Trinity, in St. Andrew's church, lived in this village, and is called Dominus de Jesmond: the Orde's family was also in posses∣sion of it.</P>
<P><PB N="621" REF="658"/>"There are still to be seen the ruins of the chapel and hospital of our Lady in this vil∣lage. The hospital is now a dwelling-house; but the chapel is changed into something worse, being turned into a stable.</P>

But on the 27th of the month following he gave it up, declaring he had no right or title to it. The copy of the original of this account I had from Dr. Hunter of Durham, and is as follows: Universis S. matris filiis, ad quos praesentes literae pervenerint, Thomas permissione divina Dun∣elm' Episcopus salutem in amplexibus Salvatoris.

<P>"To this village (Jesmond) it was that a great number of the people of Newcastle, headed by some of the aldermen and principal men of the town, came to kill the prior of Tinmouth, in the first of the reign of King Henry the Eighth.</P>
<P>"In the 3d of Edw. VI. the town got a grant of the chapel of the blessed Mary of Jes∣mond, and some messuages and lands in Jesmond, under an annual rent of 3s. 4d. pay∣able out of some lands in Old Heaton, and the chapel or chantry of St. Laurence, with the messuages called St. Laurence and Little St. Anne's Close, and lands in Byker, then in the possession of Henry Winklive, and lands in Killingworth, then in the possession of John Huntley, an annual rent of 4s. payable out of the lands of the then Christopher Mitford, in Old Heaton.</P>
<P>"These were granted in consideration of 144l. 13s. 4d.</P>
<P>"In the same year the mayor and burgesses granted the hospital of the blessed Mary of Jesmond, with the lands and grounds belonging to it, to Sir John Brandling, his heirs and assigns for ever.</P>
<P><PB N="622" REF="659"/>"The gentleman of this place at present is William Coulson, Esq. who lately built a very pretty house, and accommodated it with gardens.</P>
<P>"St. Mary's Well in this village, which is said to have had as many steps down to it as there are articles in the Creed, was lately inclosed by Mr. Coulson for a bathing place, which was no sooner done than the water left it. This occasioned strange whispers in the village and the adjacent places. The well was always esteemed of more sanctity than common wells, and therefore the failing of the water could be looked upon as nothing less than a just revenge for so great a profanation. But alas! the miracle's at an end, for the water returned a while ago in as great abundance as ever." Thus far Bourne.</P>
<P>In the plate of coins, &amp;c. struck at Newcastle upon Tyne (in this work), there is en∣graved, between the tradesmen's tokens (B), an exact representation of a religious medal, which was lately found in pulling down an old wall, supposed to have belonged to the chapel of St. Mary at this place: one side plainly gives the heads of Christ and the Vir∣gin Mary in profile; on the other side the emblems of the Eucharist, with this inscrip∣tion: LA. SI. IL. S. S. SAG. and at the bottom, ROMA. for "Laudato sia il sacrissimo sagramento, "Italian; which may be englished thus: "Praised be the most holy sacrament."</P>
<P>N. B. In the plate entitled "Monuments in the churches of St. Nicholas and All Saints," No. 1 represents the late remains of Sir George Selby's magnificent monument, and No. 2, the curious old one of George Carr; both described as having stood at the east end of St. Nicholas' church.</P>

<Q>"HERE lies buried The Reverend <HI>Richard Cuthbert,</HI> S. T. B. vicar of Kirkby in Kendale: In whose character the Christian, the scholar, and the gentleman rendered each other more illustrious. His zeal was happily tempered with knowledge and moderation. His public labours and private conduct agreed to demonstrate the integrity of his life. Stranger, suspect not this epitaph of flattery; his praises are more fully inscribed on the hearts of all who knew him, and his Master's presence will reward and perfect his virtues, by a more intimate converse with the great Exemplar. Ob. Nov. 7, A. D. 1744, aetat. 48. cur. huj. par. 11.</Q>
