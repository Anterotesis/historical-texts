<HEAD>OF THE PLAN and CONDUCT OF THE FAERIE QUEENE. SECT. I.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN the works of Homer and of Aristo∣tle began to be restored
and studied in Italy, when the pure and uncorrupted sources of antient
poesy and antient criticism were opened, and literature in general seemed
emerging from the depths of Gothic ignorance and barbarity, it might have been
expected, that, instead of the ro∣mantic species of poetical composition
introduced by the provencal bards, a new and more legitimate taste of writing
would have succeeded; that unnatural events, the machinations of imaginary
beings, and adventures entertaining only as they were improba∣ble, would have
given place to justness of thought and design, and to that decorum which
nature dictat∣ed, and which the example and the precept of anti∣quity had
authorised. But it was a long time before such a change as this was
effected; and we find A∣riosto, many years after the revival of letters,
reject∣ing <PB N="2" REF="5"/> truth for magic, and chusing rather to follow
the irregular and ridiculous excursions of Boiardo, than the propriety and
uniformity of the great Graecian and Roman Epic models. Nor was the state of
cri∣ticism less generally and effectually influenced than that of poesy
by the restoration of antient learning: Beni, one of the most celebrated
critics of the six∣teenth century, was still so infatuated with a love of
the old provencal vein, that he ventured to write a regular dissertation,
in which he compares Ariosto with Homer. Trissino, indeed, who was nearly
con∣temporary with Ariosto, had taste and boldness enough to publish a
poem written in profest imitation of the Iliad; but this attempt met with
little regard or ap∣plause, for that very reason on which its real merit
was founded; it was rejected as an insipid and unen∣tertaining performance,
having few devils or enchant∣ments to recommend it. To Trissino succeeded
Tasso, who, in his Gierusaleme Liberata, took the antients for his
guides; but was, at the same time, too sensible of the prevailing taste
for ideal beings, and romantic description, to omit them entirely; though he
was well acquainted with, and fully con∣vinced of the excellencies of Homer and
Virgil, yet he still kept the old provencal poets in his eye; like his own
Rinaldo, who after he had gaz'd on the dia∣mond shield of truth, and while he
was departing from Armida, and her enchanted gardens, could not help looking
back upon them with some remains of fondness. Nor did Tasso's poem,
though compos'd, in some measure, on a classical and uniform plan, gain
its author (in his own country at least) any high∣er <PB N="3" REF="6"/>
share of praise and reputation upon that account: Ariosto, with all his
extravagancies, was still pre∣ferred; and the superiority of the Orlando
Furioso to the Gierusaleme Liberata was at length establish'd by a
formal decree of the Academicians della Crusca, who held a solemn court of
enquiry concerning the merit of both poems.</P>
<P>In the midst of this bad taste, Spenser began to write his
FAERIE QUEENE; which, after the prac∣tice of Ariosto, was to consist of
allegories, enchant∣ments, and romantic adventures, carried on by fairy
knights, giants, magicians, and fictitious beings. It may indeed be urged, as
an instance of Spenser's weak and undiscerning judgment, that he chose
to follow Ariosto rather than Tasso, the plan and conduct of whose poem
was much more regular and legitimate than that of his rival. To this objection
it may be answered, in defence of our author, that he was rea∣sonably
induced to follow that poem which was most celebrated and popular: for tho'
the French critics in general gave the preference to Tasso, yet in Italy
the partisans, on the side of Ariosto, were by far the most numerous,
and consequently in England; for Italy, in the age of queen Elizabeth, gave
laws to our island in all matters of taste, as France has done ever
since. It must, however, be confessed at the same time, that
Spenser was in some measure in∣fluenced, from the natural biass of his
mind, to pre∣fer that plan, which would admit of the most exten∣sive range
for his unbounded imagination. What this plan is, and how it is conducted, we
shall now proceed to examine.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="7"/><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Spenser's letter
to Sir W. Raleigh, &amp;c.</NOTE>The poet supposes, that the FAERIE QUEENE
held a magnificent feast, (according to annual custom) which lasted
twelve days; on each of which respec∣tively, twelve several complaints are
preferred before her: accordingly, in order to redress the injuries which
were the occasion of these several complaints, she sends out twelve
different knights, each of which, in the particular adventure allotted to him,
proves an example of some particular virtue, as of Holiness, Temperance,
Justice, Chastity, &amp;c. and has one com∣plete book assigned to him,
of which he is the hero. But, besides these twelve knights, severally
exempli∣fying twelve moral virtues, there is one principal knight, or general
hero, viz. PRINCE ARTHUR; who represents Magnificence; a virtue which is
supposed to be the perfection of all the rest; who assists in
eve∣ry book, the end of whose actions is to find out GLO∣RIANA, or Glory, and
in whose person the poet in∣tends to pourtray, 
<Q REND="inline">"THE IMAGE OF A BRAVE KNIGHT PERFECTED IN THE
TWELVE PRIVATE MORAL VIRTUES."</Q></P>
<P>It is evident, that our author, in establishing one hero, who
seeking and attaining one grand end, viz. GLORIANA, or Glory, should
exemplify one grand character, viz. that of a brave knight perfected in the
twelve private moral virtues, had the practice of Virgil and Homer in his eye.
But tho' he was sensible of the importance and expediency of a unity of the
hero and of his design, yet he does not, at the same time, seem convinced
of the necessity of that unity of action, by which this design should
be properly accomplished; nor sufficiently acquainted with the method of
pro∣ceeding <PB N="5" REF="8"/> made use of by the two great originals
above∣mentioned, in conducting their respective heroes to the one grand end
proposed. It may be asked, with great propriety, how does ARTHUR execute
this one grand ultimate design? It may be answered, with no less
plausibility, that by assisting each patron of the twelve virtues
respectively, in his allotted defence or patronage of each, ARTHUR approaches
still nearer and nearer to Glory, 'till at last he obtains it, and so
consummates the intended grand design. But surely to assist only is
not sufficient to gain this end, or com∣plete the proposed character. The
poet ought to have made his ARTHUR the principal agent in the re∣dress of
each particular wrong, which arose from the various violation of Holiness,
Temperance, Justice, Chastity, &amp;c. If the hero had thus, in his own
per∣son, exerted himself in the service of all the twelve virtues, he
might have been deservedly stiled the per∣fect pattern of them all, and
consequently would then have completed the proposed grand end, viz. the
attainment of Glory. At present he is only a subordinate, or rather
accessory character; the diffi∣culties and obstacles which he should
have surmount∣ed in order to gain the proposed end, are done to his hand,
and removed by others; it is not he who con∣quers the dragon in the first
book, (to instance in no other) or who quells the magician Busirane in the
third; these are atchievements executed by St. George and by Britomart. In
short, the twelve several knights, or patrons, do too much for ARTHUR to do
any thing, or at least what may reasonably be expected from the plan of the
poet; while we are attending to <PB N="6" REF="9"/> the design of the hero of
the book, we forget that of the hero of the poem. Mr. Dryden remarks, 
<Q REND="inline">"We must do Spenser that justice to
observe, that mag∣nanimity [magnificence] which is the true cha∣racter of
PRINCE ARTHUR, shines throughout the whole poem; and succours the rest
when they are in distress."<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Dedication
to Juvenal.</BIBL></NOTE></Q> If the magnanimity of PRINCE AR∣THUR did in
reality shine throughout the whole poem with a steady and superior
lustre, our author would stand excused; but at present it breaks forth
but seldom, in dim and interrupted flashes; it is not like the pervading
spirit of Virgil, which 
<Q> 
<L>—<HI>Agitat molem, &amp; magno se corpore
miscet.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Aen. vi. ver.
727.</BIBL></NOTE></L></Q> And to 
<Q REND="inline">"succour the rest when they are in
distress,"</Q> is a circumstance of too little importance in the hero of
a poem: "to succour" is, in fact, a service to be perform'd in the cause
of the hero, by some dependent and inferior chief, the business of a Gyas
or a Cloanthus, a Mnestheus, or a Serestus.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, and in general, it must be ob∣served, that
Spenser's adventures, which are the sub∣ject of each single book, have no
mutual dependance upon each other, and consequenly do not contribute to
constitute one legitimate poem; and Mr. Hughes, not considering this, has
advanced a remark in com∣mendation of Spenser, which may most properly be
turned to his censure. 
<Q REND="inline">"If we consider the first book as an entire
work of itself, we shall find it to be no irregular contrivance: there is
one principal action, which is completed in the twelfth Canto, and the 
<PB N="7" REF="10"/> several incidents are proper, as they tend either to
obstruct or promote it."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Remarks on the Fairy
Queen. Hughes's edit. of Spenser's works, vol. 1.</BIBL></NOTE></Q> As the
heroic poem is required to be one WHOLE, compounded of many various parts
depending upon, and relative to each other; so it is expedient, that not one
of those parts should be so regularly contriv'd, and so completely
finished, as to become a WHOLE of itself. For the mind being thus once
satisfied in arriving at the completion of an orderly series of events,
acquiesces in that satis∣faction, and its attention and curiosity are
diverted from pursuing, with due vigour, the final and general catastrophe;
whereas while each part is left imperfect, I mean, incomplete, if disjoined or
separated from the rest, the mind still desirous and eager of
gratify∣ing its expectations, is irresistibly and imperceptibly drawn on
from part to part, till it receives a full and ultimate satisfaction from the
accomplishment of one great event, which all those parts, following and
il∣lustrating each other, contributed to produce.</P>
<P>Our author was probably aware, that by consti∣tuting twelve
several adventures for twelve several knights, a want of continuity and
general concatena∣tion of facts would be laid to his charge; and upon this
account, I suppose, he sometimes begins a story in one book, the
completion of which he defers, not without much interruption, to some future
and di∣stant book; a proceeding, which unavoidably occa∣sions much
confusion to the reader. And it seems to be for the same reason, that,
after one of the twelve knights has fulfilled the adventure of his book, he
in∣troduces <PB N="8" REF="11"/> him, in the next book; acting, perhaps, in an
inferior light, and degraded to some less dangerous adventure; a conduct
which destroys that repose which the mind feels after having accompanied a
hero, thro' various distresses and difficulties, to success and
victory. Besides, when we view the hero entering upon an in∣ferior attempt,
our former admiration is diminish∣ed; having seen him once nobly and
decisively conquer, we become so warmly interested in his ho∣nour, that
we look upon his engagement in any po∣sterior enterprise (however
successfully) which is less arduous than that of which we had just
before hail'd him the conqueror, as derogatory to that glory which he had
just acquired by such a conquest. Spenser, per∣haps, would have
embarassed himself and the reader less, had he made every book one
entire detached poem, without any the least reference to the rest. Thus he
would have written twelve distinct poems, in all of which, he might have
completed the pattern of a particular virtue in twelve knights respectively;
at present, he has remarkably failed in endeavouring to represent all the
virtues completed in the character of one. The poet must either have
established TWELVE KNIGHTS without an ARTHUR, or an ARTHUR without TWELVE
KNIGHTS. Upon supposition that Spenser was resolved to characterise
the twelve moral virtues, the former plan, perhaps, would have been best: the
latter must necessarily want simplicity, as it is an action
consisting of twelve actions, all equally great, and unconnected between
themselves; and not an action consisting of one uninterrupted and
coherent chain of incidents tending to the accomplish∣ment of one
design.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="12"/>It has been observ'd before, that our author
endea∣voured to express the character of a knight perfected in the twelve
moral virtues, by representing him as assisting in the service or
defence of each, till at last he becomes possessed of all: this plan,
however, in∣judicious, he certainly was obliged to observe; but in the third
book, which is stiled the legend of Cha∣stity, PRINCE ARTHUR doth not so
much as lend his assistance in the protection or vindication of that
virtue; he appears indeed, but not as an auxiliary in the adventure of the
book.</P>
<P>It must, however, be confessed, that there is some∣thing
artificial in the poet's manner of varying from historical precision; a
conduct which may be best il∣lustrated from his own words. 
<Q REND="inline">"But because the be∣ginning of the whole work
seemeth abrupt, and as depending upon other antecedents, it needs that ye
know the occasion of these three knights several adventures. For the
method of a poet historical, is not such as of an historiographer. For an
histo∣riographer discourseth of affairs orderly, as they were done,
accounting as well the times as the action; but a poet thrusteth into the
middest, even where it most concerneth him, and there re∣coursing to the
things forepast, and divining of things to come, maketh a pleasing
analysis of all. The beginning therefore of my history, were it to be told
by an historiographer, should be in the twelfth book, which is the last;
where I devise, that the FAERIE QUEENE held her annual feast twelve days;
upon which twelve several days, the occasion of twelve several adventures
hap∣pened: <PB N="10" REF="13"/> which being undertaken by twelve several
knights, are, in these twelve books, severally hand∣led and
discoursed.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Letter to Sir W. Raleigh.</BIBL>
It appears, from this quotation, that Spenser had finished but three books,
when this letter was writ∣ten.</NOTE>"</Q> Thus according to this plan the
reader would have been agreeably surprised, in the last book, when he
came to discover, that all the adventures which he had just gone through,
were un∣dertaken at the command of the FAERIE QUEENE, and that all the knights
had severally set forward to the execution of them from her annual
birth-day festi∣val; but Spenser, in most of his books, has
inju∣diciously forestalled the first of these particulars; which
certainly should have been concealed till the last book, not only to have
prevented a needless repe∣tition of the same thing, but that he might
likewise secure an opportunity to himself of amusing the read∣er's mind
with a circumstance new and unexpected.</P>
<P>But notwithstanding the plan and conduct of our author, in the
poem before us, is highly excep∣tionable, yet I am apt to think, that the
FAERIE QUEENE is not, upon the whole, so confused and irregular as the
Orlando Furioso. Though there is no general unity in the former, yet if we
consider every book or adventure as a separate poem, we shall meet with
so many distinct, however imperfect, uni∣ties, by which means the reader is
less bewildered, than by that general indigested medley of which the former
totally consists, and in which we meet with neither partial, nor
universal unity. 
<Q> 
<L>—<HI>Cum nec pes nec caput</HI> UNI</L> 
<L><HI>Reddatur</HI> FORMAE.—<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Hor. art poet. v. 13.</BIBL></NOTE></L></Q> 
<PB N="11" REF="14"/> The very idea of celebrating the MADNESS of an hero,
carries with it somewhat extravagant and absurd. Or∣lando doth not make his
appearance till b. 8. where he is placed in a situation not very heroic; he
is first discovered to us in bed, desiring to sleep. His ulti∣mate
design is to find Angelica, but his pursuit of her is broken off in b. 30;
after which there are sixteen more books to come, and in which Angelica
disappears. Other heroes are likewise engaged in the same pursuit.
After reading the first stanza of b. 1. one would be inclined to think,
that the subject of the poem was the expedition of the Moors into France,
under their emperor Agramante, to fight against Charlemayne; but this matter
is the least part of the poem. In fact, many of the knights perform exploits
equal, if not superior to those of Orlando; and particularly Rogero, with a
grand atchievement of wholn the poem is closed, viz. his killing Rodo∣mont;
but this event is not the completion of a story carried on principally
through the whole work. The author passes from one incident to another, and
from region to region (whether it be from England to the Hesperides, or from
the earth to the moon) with such incredible swiftness and rapidity, that
one would think he was mounted upon his own winged steed Ippogrifo. He begins
a tale of a knight in Europe, and suddenly breaks it off to resume the
unfinished catastrophe of another in Asia. The imagination of the reader
is not so much involv'd in, as it is oppressed with the mul∣tiplicity of
stories, in the relation of each of which the poet is at the same time
equally engaged. To reme∣dy this inconvenience, it was thought proper to affix,
<PB N="12" REF="15"/> in some of the editions, marginal hints, informing the
reader in what book and stanza the poet would recom∣mence some interrupted
episode; an expedient not more inartificial than that which the first
painters were obliged to make use of, in order to assist their want of
skill, who having drawn the figure of a man, a bird, or a quadruped, found it
necessary to write under∣neath the name of the kind to which the thing
repre∣sented belonged. However, this method has been the means of giving the
reader a clear comprehension of Ariosto's tales, which otherwise he could
not have obtained without much difficulty. This poet is sel∣dom read twice in
order; that is, by passing from the first canto to the second, and from
the second to the rest successively; but by persuing (without any
regard to the order of the books, or the stanzas) the different stories,
which though all somewhere finish'd, yet are, at present, so mutually
interwoven, that the incidents of one are perpetually clashing with those
of another. The ingenious Abbé Du Bos 
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Reflexions, &amp;c. c.
34.</BIBL></NOTE> observes hap∣pily enough, that 
<Q REND="inline">"Homer is a geometrician in comparison of
Ariosto:"</Q> And, indeed, his mis∣cellaneous matter cannot be better
expressed than by the two first verses of his Exordium.

QUEENE does not exhibit that oeconomy of plan, and exact arrange∣ment 
<PB N="13" REF="16"/> of parts which Epic severity requires, yet we scarcely
regret the loss of these, while their place is so amply supplied, by
something which more powerfully attracts us, as it engages the affection of
the heart, rather than the applause of the head; and if there be any poem
whose graces please, be∣cause they are situated beyond the reach of
art, and where the faculties of creative imagination delight us, because they
are unassisted and unrestrained by those of deliberate judgment, it
is in this of which we are now speaking. To sum up all in a few words; tho'
in the FAERIE QUEENE we are not satisfied as critics, yet we are
transported as readers.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="2" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. II. Of Spenser's Imitations from old Romances.</HEAD>
<P>ALthough Spenser formed his FAERIE QUEENE upon the fanciful plan
of Ariosto, as I remark∣ed in the preceding section, yet it must be
confessed, that the adventures of Spenser's knights are a more exact and
immediate copy of those which we meet with in old romances, or books of
chivalry, than they are of those of which the Orlando Furioso consists.
Ariosto's knights exhibit very surprising instances of their prowess,
and atchieve many heroic actions; but our author's knights are more
particularly engaged in revenging injuries, and doing justice to the
distressed; which was the proper business, and ultimate end of the
antient knight-errantry. And thus though many of Spenser's incidents and
expedients are to be found in Ariosto, such as that of blowing a horn, at
the sound <PB N="14" REF="17"/> of which the gates of a castle fly open, of
the vanish∣ing of an enchanted palace or garden, after some knight has
destroyed the enchanter, and the like, yet these are not more peculiarly
the property of Ario∣sto, than they are common to all antient romances in
general. Spenser's first book is, indeed, a regular and precise imitation
of such a series of action as we frequently meet with in books of chivalry:
For in∣stance, a king's daughter applies to a knight, that he would relieve
her father and mother, who are closely confined to their castle, upon
account of a vast and terrible dragon, that had ravaged their country, and
perpetually laid in wait to destroy them. The knight sets forward with the
lady, encounters a monster in the way, is plotted against by an enchanter,
and after surmounting a variety of difficulties and obstacles, arrives at
the country which is the scene of the dra∣gon's devastations, kills him,
and is presented to the king and queen, whom he has just delivered;
mar∣ries their daughter, but is soon obliged to leave her, on account of
fulfilling a former vow. It may be likewise observed, that the
circumstance of each of Spenser's twelve knights, setting out from one
place, by a different way, to perform a different adventure, exactly
resembles that of the seven knights proceed∣ing forwards to their several
expeditions, in the well-known romance, entitled the Seven Champions of
Christendom. In fact, these miraculous books were highly fashionable, and
that chivalry, which was the subject of them, was still practiced, in the
age of queen Elizabeth.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Hollingshead's
Chronicles, vol. iii. p. 1315.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="18"/>Among others, there is one romance which
Spen∣ser seems more particularly to have made use of: It is entitled
MORTE ARTHUR, <HI>The Lyf of Kyng Arthur, of his noble Knyghtes of the round
table, and in thende the dolorous deth of them all.</HI> This was translated
into English from the French, by one Sir Thomas Maleory, Knight, and printed
by W. Caxton, 1484<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This Book has been reprinted twice
or thrice. The last Edition is dated 1634.</NOTE>. From this fabulous
history our author has borrow'd many of his names, viz. Sir Tristram,
Placidas, Pelleas, Pellenore, Percivall, and others. As to Sir Tristram, he
has copied from this book the circumstances of his birth and education with
much exactness. Spenser in∣forms us that Sir Tristram was born in
Cornwall, &amp;c. 
<Q> 
<L>And Tristram is my name, the only heire</L>

<Q> 
<L>The which the fertile Lionesse is hight.</L><BIBL>ibid.

<P>Which particulars are drawn from the romance abovemention'd. 
<Q REND="inline">"There was a knight Meliodas [Meliogras] and he
was lord and king of the country of Lyones—and he wedded king Markes
sister of Cornewale."</Q> The issue of which mar∣riage, as we are
afterwards told, was Sir Tristram<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Book
ii. chap. i.</BIBL></NOTE>. <PB N="16" REF="19"/> Mention is then made in our
romance, of Sir Tri∣stram's banishment from Lyones into a distant
country, by the advice, and under the conduct of a wise and learned
counsellor named Governale. A circumstance alluded to by Spenser in
these verses. 
<Q> 
<L>So taking counsel of a wise man red,</L> 
<L>She was by him adviz'd, to send me quight</L> 
<L>Out of the countrie, wherein I was bred,</L>

describ'd below.

</LG></Q></P>
<P>Which is agreeable to what is said in the romance. After mention
being made of Tristram's having learn∣ed <PB N="17" REF="20"/> the language of
France, courtly behaviour, and skill in chivalry, we have the following
passage.

Tristram.

<P>From this romance our author also took the hint of his BLATANT
BEAST; which is there call'd the QUESTING BEAST. 
<Q REND="inline">"Therewithall the King saw comming towards him
the strangest beast that ever he saw, or heard tell off.—And the
noyse was in the beasts belly like unto the <HI>Questyn</HI> of thirtie
couple of houndes."</Q> The QUESTING BEAST is afterwards more particularly
described. 
<Q REND="inline">"That had in shap an head like a serpent's
head, and a body like a liberd, buttocks like a lyon, and footed like a hart;
and in his body there was such a noyse, as it had been the noyse of

made where∣soever he went."<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>B. ii. c.

monstrous animal than he is here represented to be, and in general has
varied from this description; though there is one circumstance in
Spenser's repre∣sentation, in which there is a resemblance,
viz.—speaking of his mouth, 
<Q> 
<L>And therein were a thousand tongues empight,</L> 
<L>Of sundry kindes, and sundry qualities,</L> 
<L>Some were of dogs that barked night and day.</L> 
<L>And some, &amp;c.—</L> 
<BIBL>6. 12. 27.</BIBL></Q> 
<Q> 
<L>So dreadfully his hundred tongues did bray,</L> 
<BIBL>5. 12. 41.</BIBL></Q> By what has been hitherto said,
perhaps the reader may not be persuaded, that Spenser, in his BLATANT
BEAST, had the QUESTING BEAST of our romance in his eye; but the poet has
himself taken care to in∣form us of this: for we learn, from the romance,
that certain knights of the round table were destined to pursue the
QUESTING BEAST perpetually without success: which Spenser hints at in
these lines. 
<Q> 
<L>Albe that long time after Calidore,</L> 
<L>The good Sir Pelleas him tooke in hand,</L> 
<L>And after him Sir Lamoracke of yore,</L> 
<L>And all his brethren borne in Britaine land,</L> 
<L>Yet none of these could ever bring him into band.</L> 
<BIBL>6. 12.</BIBL></Q> Sir Lamoracke, and Sir Pelleas are two
very valour∣ous champions of Arthur's round table.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="22"/>This romance likewise supplied our author
with the story of the mantle made of the beards of knights, and locks of
ladies; which last circumstance is added by Spenser. 
<Q> 
<L>For may no knight or ladie passe along</L> 
<L>That way (and yet they needs must passe that way)</L> 
<L>By reason of the streight and rocks among,</L> 
<L>But they that ladies lockes do shave away,</L>

of which is this insolent demand of king Ryence. Drayton, in his Poly∣olbion,
speaks of a coat composed of the beards of kings: he is celebrating king
Arthur.

manifestly alludes to a passage in Geoffrey of Monmouth; who informs us,
that a Spanish giant, named Ritho, having forcibly conveyed away from her
guard Helena the niece of duke Hoel, possessed himself of St.
Michael's Mount in Cornwall, from whence he made frequent sallies, and
committed various outrages; that, at last, king Arthur conquered this giant,
and took from him a certain coat, which he had been composing of the beards
of kings, a vacant place being left for king Arthur's beard.<NOTE N="(†)" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Orig. &amp; Gest. Reg. Brit. B. 10,

<P>As Spenser has copied many other fictions from MORTE ARTHUR, I
apprehend that he drew this from thence, and not from Geoffrey of Monmouth; not
to mention, that Spenser's circumstances tally more exactly with those in
the romance.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="24"/>There is great reason to conclude, not only
from what has already been mention'd concerning Spenser's imitations from
this romantic history of king Arthur and his knights, but from some
circum∣stances which I shall now produce, that it was a favo∣rite and
reigning romance about the age of queen Elizabeth; or at least one very well
known and much read at that time. Spenser in the Shepherd's Calen∣dar has the
following passage. 
<Q> 
<L>And whither rennes this bevie of ladies bright</L> 
<L>Raunged in a row?</L> 
<L>They been all LADIES OF THE LAKE behight,</L> 
<L>That unto her go.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Aprill.</BIBL></NOTE></L></Q></P>
<P>Upon the words LADIES OF THE LAKE, E. K. the old commentator on
the pastorals has the follow∣ing remark. 
<Q REND="inline">"LADIES OF THE LAKE be nymphes: for it was an old
opinion among the antient Hea∣thens, that of every spring and fountaine was a
goddesse the soveraine; which opinion stucke in the minds of men not
many years since by meanes of certain fine fablers, or loose lyers; such
as were the authors of KING ARTHUR the great.—Who tell many an unlawfull
leesing of the LADIES OF THE LAKE."</Q> These fine fablers or loose
lyers, are the authors of the romance above-mention'd, viz. MORTE ARTHUR, where
many miracles are brought about, and much enchantment is carried on by the
means and interposition of the LADY OF THE LAKE. Now <PB N="22" REF="25"/> it
should be observed, that the LADY OF THE LAKE was introduc'd to make part
of queen Elizabeth's en∣tertainment at Kenelworth; as an evidence of which I
shall produce a passage from an antient book entit∣led 
<Q REND="inline">"A letter, wherein part of the entertainment
un∣too the queens majesty at Killingworth-castl in Warwick-sheer in this
soomers progress, 1575, is signified."</Q> The passage is this. 
<Q REND="inline">"Her highness all along this tilt-yard rode unto
the inner gate, next the baze coourt of the castle: whear the LADIE OF THE
LAKE (famous in KING ARTHUR'S BOOK) with too nymphes wayting upon her, ar∣rayed
all in sylkes, attended her highnes comming, from the midst of the pool,
whear upon a move∣able island bright-blazing with torches she floting to
land, met her majesty with a well-penned meter, and matter, after this
sorte; first of the auncientee of the castl; who had been owners of the
same e'en till this day, most allways in the handes of the earles of
Leycester; how she had kept this lake syns king Arthur's dayes, and now
understand∣ing of her highnes hither comming, thought it both offis and
duety; to discover, in humble wise, her, and her estate, offring up the

pleas'd her highnes to thank this lady, &amp;c."</Q></P>
<P>Gascoyne 
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Works, London, 1576.</BIBL></NOTE>
in a little narrative called the 
<Q REND="inline">"Prince∣ly Pleasures of Kenelworth
Castle,"</Q> gives us some of the above-mention'd metre, written by
Ferrers, <PB N="23" REF="26"/> one of the contributors to the mirror of
magistrates, of which these may serve as a specimen. 
<Q> 
<LG>
<L>I am the lady of this pleasant lake,</L>
<L>Who since the time of great king Arthur's reigne,</L>
<L>That here with royall court aboade did make,</L>
<L>Have led a lowring life in restless paine;</L>
<L>'Till now that this your third arrival here,</L>
<L>Doth cause me come abroad, and boldly thus appeare.</L>

<LG>
<L>For after him such stormes this castle shook,</L>
<L>By swarming Saxons first, who scourgde this land</L>
<L>As forth of this my poole I neer durst looke, &amp;c.</L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>She is afterwards introduc'd complaining to the queen, that sir
Bruse had insulted her for doing an injury to Merlin, (an incident related
in MORTE ARTHUR); and that he would have put her to death had not Neptune
deliver'd her, by concealing her in that lake; from which confinement the queen
is after∣wards suppos'd to deliver her, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Without expatiating upon the nature of such a royal
entertainment as this, I shall observe from it that the LADY OF THE LAKE
(and consequently the romance which supply'd this fiction) was a very
po∣pular character in the reign of queen Elizabeth; and we may add, that it is
not improbable that Spenser might allude in the above-cited verses to
some of the circumstances in this part of the queen's entertainment; for
queen Elisabeth, the Fayre Elisa, is the lady whom the LADIES OF LAKE are
represented as repairing to, <PB N="24" REF="27"/> in that eclogue<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Spenser's pastorals were published about four years after
this entertainment.</NOTE>. Nor is it improbable that this lady was often
exhibited upon other occasions. Nor is it improper to remark in this place
that Ben. Johnson has introduced her, together with king Arthur and Mer∣lin,
in an entertainment before the court of James I. called PRINCE HENRIES
BARRIERS.</P>
<P>The above antient letter acquaints us, that the queen was
entertain'd with a song from this romance, which is another proof of it's
popularity at that time. 
<Q REND="inline">"A minstrall came forth with a sollem song
warrant∣ed for story out of king Arthur's acts the first book, 24. whereof
I gat a copy, and that is this, 
<Q> 
<L>"So it fell out on a pentecost day</L> 
<L>"When king Arthur, &amp;c."</L></Q></Q></P>
<P>This is the song above hinted at, where mention is made of king
Rience demanding the beard of king Arthur. In the same letter a gentleman who
shew'd some particular feats of activity before the queen, is said to be 
<Q REND="inline">"very cunning in fens, and hardy as Gawen."</Q>
Which Gawen was king Arthur's ne∣phew, and whose atchievements are highly
celebrat∣ed in MORTE ARTHUR.</P>
<P>We find Spenser in another place alluding to the fable of the
lady of the lake so much spoken of in this romance. 
<Q> 
<LG>
<L>—A little while</L>
<L>Before that Merlin dyde, he did intend</L>
<L><PB N="25" REF="28"/>A brasen wall in compas to compyle</L>

the fol∣lowing relation in MORTE ARTHUR. 
<Q REND="inline">"The LADY OF THE LAKE and Merlin departed; and by
the way as they went, Merlin shewed to her many wonders, and came into
Cornewaile. And alwaies Merlin lay about the ladie for to have her favour; and
she was ever passing wery of him, and faine would have been deliver'd of
him; for she was afraid of him, because he was a divells son, and she
could not put him away by no meanes. And so upon a time it hapned that Merlin
shewed to her in a roche [rock] whereas was a great wonder, and wrought by
enchauntment, which went under a stone, so by her subtile craft and

<P>Our author has taken notice of a superstitious tra∣dition,
which is related at large in this romance. 
<Q> 
<L>—Good Lucius</L> 
<L>That first received christianitie,</L> 
<L>The sacred pledge of Christs evangelie:</L> 
<L>Yet true it is that long before that day</L> 
<L>Hither came Joseph of Arimathie,</L> 
<L>Who brought with him the HOLY GRAYLE, they say,</L> 
<L>And preacht the truth; but since it greatly did decay.</L> 
<BIBL>2. 10. 53.</BIBL></Q> The HOLY GRAYLE, that is the real
blood of our blessed Saviour. What Spenser here writes GRALE, is often
written SANGREAL, or <HI>St. grale</HI> in MORTE AR∣THUR, and is there said
to have been brought into England by Joseph of Arimathea. Many of king
Arthur's knights are there represented as going in quest, or in search of
the SANGREAL, or SANGUIS REALIS. This expedition was one of the first
subjects of the old romance.</P>
<P>This romance seems to have extended its reputation beyond the
reign of queen Elizabeth. B. Johnson, besides his allusion to it in the
LADY OF THE LAKE mention'd above, hints at it more than once: 
<Q><PB N="27" REF="30"/>

<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>REMAINS, printed 1604. Artic.
names.</BIBL></NOTE> refers to this history of king Arthur, as to a book
familiarly known to the readers of his age. Speaking of the name TRISTRAM, he
observes, 
<Q REND="inline">"I know not whether the first of this name was
christned by king Arthur's fabler."</Q> Again, of LAUNCELOT he speaks, 
<Q REND="inline">"Some think it to be no ancient name, but forged
by the writer of king Arthur's history, for one of his douty knights:"</Q>
and of GAWEN, 
<Q REND="inline">"A name devised by the author of king Arthur's
table."</Q></P>
<P>To this we may add, that Milton manifestly hints at it in the
following lines, 
<Q> 
<L>—Damsels met in forrests wide</L> 
<L>By knights of Logris, or of Lyones,</L> 
<L>Lancelot, Pelleas, or Pellenore.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Par. Reg. B. ii, v. 359.</BIBL></NOTE></L></Q> These are

Pellenore, who are <PB N="28" REF="31"/> often mention'd in MORTE ARTHUR, and
repre∣sented as meeting beautiful damsels in desolate for∣rests: and
probably he might have it in his eye when he wrote the following, as the round
table is express∣ly hinted at.

<P>Before I leave this romance, I must observe, that Ariosto
has been indebted to it; I do not mean, to the old translation, which
Spenser made use of. He has drawn his enchanter Merlin from it, and in

Bradamante is suppos'd to visit the tomb of Merlin.

<L>—Tristano</L> 
<L>Lancillotto, Galasso, Artu, e Galuano.<NOTE N="(†)" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>C. 4. S. 52.</BIBL></NOTE></L></Q> Afterwards, in b. 32.
Tristram makes a great figure. From this romance is also borrow'd
Ariosto's tale<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>C. 42. 98.</BIBL></NOTE> of the
enchanted cup; which, in Caxton's old transla∣tion, is as follows. 
<Q REND="inline">"By the way they met with a knight, that was
sent from Morgan le Faye to king Arthur; and this knight had a faire horne
all gar∣nished with gold; and the horne had such a virtue, that there might
no ladie or gentlewoman drink of that horne, but if shee were true to her

and if shee were true unto her lord, shee might drink peaceably,

Afterwards many tryals are made with this cup. The inimitable Fon∣taine has
new-moulded this story from Ariosto, under the title of <HI>La coupe
enchanteé.</HI> As it is manifest, from a comparison of
passages, that Ariosto was very con∣versant <PB N="31" REF="34"/> in
this romance; so I think it may be granted, that he drew the idea of his
Orlando running mad with jealousy from it. In MORTE ARTHUR, Sir Lancelot, out
of a jealous fit, is driven to madness, in which state he continues for the
space of two years, perform∣ing a thousand ridiculous pranks, no less
extravagant than those of Orlando; and, like him, at length he recovers his
senses.</P>
<P>I had forgot to remark before, that our author has borrow'd the
name of Materasta's castle from that of Lancelot in MORTE ARTHUR.

<P>This miraculous manner of healing our author drew from an old
poem, entitled, Sir Bevis of Southampton, viz. 
<Q> 
<L>"What for weary, and what for faint</L> 
<L>"Sir Bevis was neere attaint:</L> 
<L>"The dragon followed on Bevis so hard,</L> 
<L>"That as he would have fled backward,</L> 
<L>"There was a well as I weene,</L> 
<L>"And he stumbled right therein.</L> 
<L>"Then was Sir Bevis afraid and woe,</L> 
<L>"Lest the dragon should him sloe:</L> 
<L>"Or that he might away passe,</L> 
<L>"When that he in the well was.</L> 
<L>"Then was the well of such vertu</L> 
<L>"Through the might of Christ Jesu,</L> 
<L>"For sometime dwelled in that land</L> 
<L>"A virgin full of Christes sand,</L> 
<L><PB N="35" REF="38"/>"That had been bathed in that well,</L> 
<L>"That ever after, as men can tell,</L> 
<L>"Might no venomous worme come therein,</L> 
<L>"By the virtue of that virgin,</L> 
<L>"Nor nigh it seven foot and more:</L> 
<L>"Then Bevis was glad therefore,</L> 
<L>"When he saw the Dragon fell</L> 
<L>"Had no power to come to the well.</L> 
<L>"Then was he glad without faile,</L> 
<L>"And rested awhile for his availe,</L> 
<L>"And drank of the water of his fill,</L> 
<L>"And then he leapt out of the well,</L> 
<L>"And with Morglay, his brand</L> 
<L>"Assailed the Dragon, I understand:</L> 
<L>"On the Dragon he strucke so fast, &amp;c.</L></Q> After
which the Dragon strikes the knight with such violence, that he falls into
a swoon, and tumbles as it were lifeless into the well, by whose
sovereign virtue he is reviv'd. 
<Q> 
<L>"When Bevis was at the ground</L> 
<L>"The water made him whole and sound,</L> 
<L>"And quenched all the venim away,</L> 
<L>"This well saved Bevis that day.</L></Q></P>
<P>And afterwards, 
<Q> 
<L>"But ever when Bevis was hurt sore,</L> 
<L>"He went to the well and washed him thore;</L> 
<L><PB N="36" REF="39"/>"He was as whole as any man,</L> 
<L>"And ever as fresh as when he began.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"> 
<P>It may be observ'd, that this poem of Sir Bevis is
written in that short measure, which was frequently sung to the harp in
queen Elizabeth's time: a custom which descended from the antient bards.
The author of the arte of English poesie, printed 1589, thus speaks of
it. 
<Q REND="inline">"So on the other side doth the
over-busie and too speedy returne of one manner of tune, too much annoy,
and, as it were, glut the eare, unless it be in small and popular
musickes song by these cantabanqui upon benches and barrels heads, where
they have none other audience than boyes, or country fellowes, that passe
by them in the streete; or else by blind harpers, or such like
taverne-minstrels, that give a fit of mirth for a groat; and their matters
being, for the most part, stories of old time; as, the tale of Sir Topas,
the Reportes of Bevis of Southampton, Guy of Warwicke, Adam Bell, and Clymme of
the Clough, and such other old romances or historicall Rhymes, made
purposely for re∣creation of the common people at Christmasse diners,
and bri∣deales; and in tavernes, and alehouses, and such other places of
base resort: also they be us'd in carols and rounds, and such light or
lascivious poemes, which are commonly more commodiously uttered by these
buffoons and VICES in plays, than by any other person: such were the rimes
of Skelton (usurping the name of a poet laureate) being in deede but a rude
rayling rimer, and all his doings ridiculous; he used both short
distaunces and short measures, pleasing only the popular eare; in our
courtly MAKER we banish them utterly." 
<BIBL>B. ii. c. 9.</BIBL></Q> Hence it appears, that
Chaucer was, at that time, sung to the harp; for the tale, or rime, of Sir
Thopas is a poem of Chaucer now extant: so the Italians, at present, sing
Tasso and Ariosto. Adam Bell and Clym of the Clough were two famous
archers: the former of which is, on that account, alluded to by
Shakespeare.</P> 
<P>The same author, in another place, speaks of this kind
of enter∣tainment, by which one would think that it was not always confin'd to
such a vulgar audience. 
<Q REND="inline">"We ourselves, who compiled this
treatise, have written for pleasure, a little brief romance, or
histo∣rical ditty, in the English tong, of the isle of Great-Britaine, in
short and long meeters; and by breaches or divisions to be more
commodiously sung to the harpe in places of assembly, where the company
shall be desirous to hear of old adventures, and va∣liaunces of noble
knights in times past; as are those of king Ar∣thur, and his knights of the
round table; Sir Bevys of Southamp∣ton, Guy of Warwicke, and such other
like." 
<BIBL>B. i. c. 19.</BIBL></Q></P></NOTE></L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="40"/>The circumstance of the Dragon not being
able to approach within seven feet of this well, is imitated by our author
St. 49. below, where another water is men∣tioned, which in like manner
preserves the knight. 
<Q> 
<L>"But nigh thereto the ever-damned beast</L> 
<L>"Durst not approache, for he was mortal made,</L> 
<L>"And all that life preserved did detest,</L> 
<L>"Yet he it oft adventur'd to invade.</L></Q></P>
<P>Tho' we feel somewhat of an ill-natur'd pride, and a
disingenuous triumph, in having detected the latent and obscure source,
from whence an admired and ori∣ginal author has drawn some favorite and
celebrated description; yet it must be confess'd, that this is soon
overwhelmed by a generous and exalted pleasure, which naturally flows from
contemplating the chymi∣cal energy of true genius, which can produce so
won∣derfull a transmutation, and whose virtues are not less potent,
efficacious, and vivifying in their nature, than those of the miraculous
water here described.</P>
<P>It should be mention'd in this place, that Spenser, in his
Dragon-encounters, follows the incidents made use of by the romance-writers,
with all the punctuality of a close copyist.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="41"/>As to Spenser's original and genealogy of
the Fairy nation, I am induc'd to believe, that part of it was supply'd by
his own inexhaustible imagination, and part by some fabulous history. He
tells us, B. ii. c. 10. S. 70. that man, as first made by Prometheus, was
called ELFE, who wandring through the world, at last arriv'd at the gardens
of Adonis, where he found a female, whom he called FAY; that the issue of
these two were called Fairies, who soon grew to be a mighty people, and
conquer'd all nations. That their eldest son Elfin govern'd America, and
the next to him, named Elfinan, founded the city of Cleopo∣lis, which was
enclos'd with a golden wall by Elfiline. That his son Elfine overcome the
Gobbelines; but that, of all Fairies, Elfant was most renowned, who built
Panthea of Crystall.—To these succeeded Elfar, who kill'd two
brethren-giants; and to him Elfinor, who built a bridge of glass over the
sea, the sound of which was like thunder. At length Elficleos rul'd the
Fairy land with much wisdom, and highly en∣creas'd its honour: he left two
sons, the eldest of which, fair Elferon, died an immature death, and
whose place was supply'd by the mighty Oberon, whose wide memorial
(continues our author) still re∣mains, and who dying, left Tanaquil to
succeed him by will, who is likewise called Glorian, or GLORIANA.</P>
<P>In the circumstance of Elfinel, who overcame the Gobbelines, he
plainly alludes to the faction of the Guelfes and Gibbelines in Italy; and his
friend and commentator E. K. remarks,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Eclogue,
June.</BIBL></NOTE> that our Elfes and <PB N="39" REF="42"/> Goblins were
deriv'd from those two parties Guelfes and Gibelines. But in the latter part
of this relation, under the fictitious names of these ideal beings, he has
adumbrated some of our English princes. Elficleos is king Henry VII,
whose eldest son Arthur died at sixteen years of age; and whose
youngest son Oberon, that is, Henry VIII, succeeded to the crown,
marry∣ing, about the same time, his brother Arthur's wi∣dow, the princess
Katherine; which is what Spenser more particularly hints at in these lines,

<Q> 
<L>Whose emptie place the mighty Oberon,</L> 
<L>Doubly supply'd in SPOUSALL and DOMINION.</L> 
<BIBL>St. 75.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>The same of this king was very recent in our au∣thor's age.</P>
<P>It is remarkable that Spenser says nothing of Ed∣ward VI. and
queen Mary, who reigned between Henry VIII. and queen Elizabeth, but that he
passes immediately from Oberon to Tanaquill, or GLORI∣ANA, i. e. queen
Elizabeth, who was excluded from her right by those two intermediate reigns. 
<Q> 
<L>He dying left the fairest Tanaquill,</L> 
<L>Him to succeed there by his last will:</L> 
<L>Fairer and nobler liveth none this howre.</L><BIBL>St.
75.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>And the reader may observe, that there is much ad∣dress and
art in the poet's manner of making this o∣mission. There is so much
confusion in Spenser's <PB N="40" REF="43"/> series of this fairy people,
that it is difficult to deter∣mine, whether or no he has here allegorised any
o∣ther English reign. However in Elfant who laid the foundation of Cleopolis,
he may signify king Lud, as it appears, by another place, that Cleopolis is
London, 
<Q> 
<L>Till now, said then the knight, I weened well,</L> 
<L>That great Cleopolis where I have been,</L> 
<L>In which the fairest FAERIE QUEENE doth dwell.</L></Q></P>
<P>The fairest FAERIE QUEENE is queen Elizabeth: and by the lines
that immediately follow, it should seem that Panthea is the queen's palace,

<Q> 
<L>—The fairest citie was that might be seene,</L> 
<L>And that bright towr all built of crystall cleene,</L> 
<L>PANTHEA.—</L> 
<BIBL>1. 10. 58.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>But this idea of the crystall tower, and of the gold∣en wall,
and bridge of glass, &amp;c. mention'd above, seem to be some romantic
tradition. As to his FAE∣RIE QUEENE, the notion of such a personage was
very common; Chaucer in his Rime of Sir Thopas speaks of her, together with a
fairy land; and Shake∣spere who was universally conversant in popular
su∣perstition, has introduc'd her in his Midsummer∣night's Dream. She was
suppos'd to have held her court in the highest magnificence in the days of
king Arthur, a circumstance by which the happiness of that reign was
originally represented in the romantic annals of it.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="44"/>Thus Chaucer.</P>
<Q> 
<L>In the old dayis of the king Arthure,</L> 
<L>(Of which the Britons speken great honour)</L> 
<L>All was this lond fulfillid of Fayry,</L>

<P>It appears from John Marston's Satires, entitled, The

Fairies were the principal actors, viz.

<P>And in another Place.

<P>And I have seen a romance which seems to have been written
soon after Spenser's poem, entitled, The RED-ROSE KNIGHT; where the knight,
after the example of prince Arthur, goes in search of the Fairy Queen.</P> 
<P>The satires above-mention'd contain many well-drawn
characters, and several good strokes of a satirical genius, but are not
upon the whole so finished and classical as bishop Hall's, the
first part of which were publish'd about a year before these. Among other
passages the following struck me, as being a good deal in the strain of
the beginning of Milton's L'Allegro.

<P>Langbaine (Dram. Poets pag. 351.) informs us, that these

poetry. Two years after these, viz. 1600, another collecti∣on of satires
appear'd written by W. Rowlands, which are by no means contemptible. These

<L>Pluto that is king of FAYRIE.</L></Q></P>
<P>And above, 
<Q> 
<L>Proserpine, and all her FAYRIE.</L></Q></P>
<P>This fiction of the Fairies was undoubtedly brought with many
other fantastic extravagancies of the like <PB N="43" REF="46"/> nature from
the Eastern nations, by the European Christians, who had been at the holy
war; and those expeditions were some of the first subjects of romance;
as an admirable judge of this matter observes; who farther informs us; 
<Q REND="inline">"Nor were the monstrous em∣bellishments of

<P>The Persians call the Fairies Peri; and the Arabs Ginn; and they

that Arthur still reigns in Fairy-land, from whence he will one day return to
Britain, and re-esta∣blish the round table, &amp;c. Thus Lydgate,

<P>Many other instances might be alledged, from which it would be
more abundantly manifested, that the imagination of our author was deeply
tinctur'd with that species of writing with which his age was so 
<PB N="44" REF="47"/> intimately acquainted, and so generally delighted: but
we have, perhaps, been already sufficiently prolix in a disquisition,
which to the lovers of Spenser, cannot appear altogether unentertaining; a
disquisition, af∣fording that kind of information, which, though it does
not improve the judgment, will gratify the cu∣riosity. And if there should
be any readers, who, disgusted with the ideas of knights, dragons, and
en∣chanters, should, after perusing the FAERIE QUEENE, address the author
of it, as cardinal d'Este did Ario∣sto, after reading his Orlando,

<DIV1 N="3" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. III. Of Spenser's use and abuse of antient
history and mythology.</HEAD>
<P>AS Spenser sought to produce surprise by extra∣vagant
incidents, and fantastic descriptions, the mythology of the antients
afforded matter no less co∣pious than suitable for such a design. He
has ac∣cordingly adopted some of their most romantic fic∣tions, in many of
which he has departed from the re∣ceived tradition, as his purpose and
subject required. And, indeed, with regard to our author's
misrepre∣sentation of the fables of antiquity, it may be ob∣served, that
from those arguments which are pro∣duced <PB N="45" REF="48"/> against his
fidelity, new ones may be drawn in favour of his fancy. Spenser's native
force of in∣vention would not permit him to pursue the letter of prescribed
fiction with tame regularity and scru∣pulous exactness. In many particulars
he varies from antiquity merely that he may introduce new beauties, and
frequently mentions one or two circum∣stances of antient fable, not so much
with a design of adorning his poem with them, as of taking an oppor∣tunity
from them, of raising a new fiction of his own. He sometimes, indeed,
misrepresents these matters through haste; his allusions to antient
history are likewise very frequent, which in many instances he has not
scrupled to violate, with equal freedom, and for the same reasons. 
<Q><BIBL>B. i. c. i. S. xxxvii.</BIBL> 
<L>A bold bad man that dar'd to call by name</L> 
<L>Great Gorgon.—</L></Q></P>
<P>Mr. Jortin has cited many instances, by which it appears, that
the antients were most superstitiously fearfull of uttering the name of
Gorgon, or Daemo∣gorgon. It may not be impertinent to remark, that they were no
less afraid of calling the furies by their names.</P>
<P>Electra, in Euripides, says of the furies that tor∣mented her
brother.

<P>Below we have the same superstition concerning Hecate; for
which it would be difficult, perhaps, to bring any antient testimony, 
<Q> 
<L>And threatned unto him the dreaded name</L> 
<L>Of Hecate—</L> 
<BIBL>St. 43.</BIBL></Q> Either that her name was fear'd in
general, or that Morpheus was particularly afraid of uttering, or of hearing
it. Our author, with great strength of fancy, has feign'd such a
circumstance as this of Merlin. 
<Q> 
<L>The fiends do quake, when any him to them does name.</L> 
<BIBL>3. 3. 11.</BIBL></Q> Though perhaps this is not more
expressive of Mer∣lin's diabolical power than what Olaus Magnus men∣tions
of that of a Swedish enchanter, viz. That he could <PB N="47" REF="50"/> blunt
the edge of the weapons of his enemies only by looking at them; and that he
could make hell a light place. 
<Q><BIBL>B. i. C. iv. S. 30.</BIBL></Q> He is describing Envy, 
<Q> 
<L>—still did chaw</L> 
<L>Betweene his cankred teeth a venemous toad,</L> 
<L>That all the poyson ran about his jaw.</L></Q></P>
<P>Ovid 
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Met. ii. v. 760.</BIBL></NOTE> tells
us, that Envy was found eating the flesh of vipers, which is not much unlike
Spenser's picture. But our author has heighten'd this circum∣stance to a
most disgusting degree; for he adds, that the poyson ran about her jaw.
This is, perhaps, one of the most loathsom ideas that Spenser has given
us, though he paints very strongly (as Jortin observes) B. i. i. 20. 
<Q> 
<L>—She spewd out of her filthy maw</L> 
<L>A flood of poyson horrible and black;</L> 
<L>Full of great lumps of flesh and gobbets raw,</L> 
<L>Which stunk so vilely that it forc'd him slack</L> 
<L>His grasping hold.—</L></Q> As also in the
discovery of Duessa, 1. 8. 47. 48. He is also very indelicate where he
speaks of Serena's wounds. 
<Q> 
<L>For now her wounds corruption 'gan to breed.</L> 
<BIBL>6. 5. 31.</BIBL></Q> <PB N="48" REF="51"/> See also 7. 7.
31. and 7. 7. 40. In reality, the strength of our author's imagination could
not be suppress'd or kept in on any subject, and in some measure it
is owing to the fullness of his stanza, and the frequency of his rhymes,
that he has describ'd these disagreeable ob∣jects so minutely. But to
return to his Envy. This personage is again introduc'd, 5. 12. 29. chawing a
snake, of which circumstance a most beautiful use is there made, St.
39. 
<Q> 
<L>Then from her mouth the gobbet she does take</L> 
<L>The which whyleare she was so greedily</L> 
<L>Devouring; even that half-gnawen snake</L> 
<L>And at him throwes it most despitefully:</L> 
<L>The cursed serpent, tho' she hungrily</L> 
<L>Earst chaw'd thereon, yet was not all so dead,</L> 
<L>But that some life remained secretly,</L> 
<L>And as he past before withouten dread,</L> 
<L>Bit him behind, that long the mark was to be read.</L></Q></P>
<P>It may be urg'd, that Spenser drew the thought of her throwing
the Snake at him, from Alecto's attack upon Amata. 
<Q> 
<L><HI>Huic Dea caeruleis unum de crinibus anguem</HI></L> 
<L><HI>Conjicit, inque sinus praecordia ad intima
condit.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Aen.
vii.v.346.</BIBL></NOTE></L></Q></P>
<P>But Spenser's application of this thought, is surely a much
greater effort of invention than the thought itself. The malignity both of
Envy, and of her Snake, <PB N="49" REF="52"/> could not have been exprest is
more significant strokes; tho' the snake was her constant food, yet
she was tempted to deprive herself of sustenance, that she might
cast it at him; and tho' the snake by being thus con∣stantly fed upon was
almost dead, yet it's natural ma∣lignity enabled it to bite him violently. 
<Q><BIBL>B. i. C. v. S. xxxix.</BIBL>

<P>Theseus did not rend his tongue upon this occasion. Mr. Jortin
would excuse our author for his false re∣presentation of this matter, by
supposing an elleipsis, viz. <HI>he began to rend his hair, and (to blame
or curse) his</HI> tongue. Tho' Spenser is full of elleipses, yet he
seldom has been guilty of such a one as this; I should therefore think
this passage ought not to be refer'd to Spenser's Elleipses, but to
that fault which he so fre∣quently commits, the fal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ication of antient story. Besides the words <HI>that

to mythology in representing Erebus and Night as married. In another place
this address is made to Night.

<PB N="51" REF="54"/> Mr. Upton would read EREBUS for Cerberus: the alteration
is indeed ingenious; and to his defence of it he might have added, that Milton,
in one of his juvenile Latin poems, has shewn his knowledge of this
mythological point, viz. 
<Q> 
<L>Nox <HI>senis amplexus</HI> EREBI <HI>taciturna
petivit.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>After all, it is not improbable but that Milton might write
CERBERUS: full of the idea of the loath∣somness of melancholy, he seems
to have chosen out the most detestable parents for her that his
imagination could suggest, CERBERUS and MIDNIGHT; and it should be
observed, that he does not say Midnight simply, but <HI>blackest
Midnight,</HI> an epithet by which he strongly marks out his abhorrence of
the offspring of so foul a pair, and the consistency and propriety of her
being leagu'd with Cerberus.</P>
<P>Our author is likewise true to mythology in what he says of
Night, in the following verses,

thought of the horses of the Sun, which are nam'd in Ovid. Milton, in the

adds this fine image,

<P>It is observable, that this little poem of Milton, as containing
a council, conspiracy, and attempt of Sa∣tan, may look'd upon as an early
prelusion of his ge∣nius to the subject of the paradise lost. 
<Q><BIBL>B. ii. C. vii. S. 53.</BIBL> 
<L>The garden of Proserpina this hight;</L> 
<L>And in the midst thereof a silver seat</L> 
<L>With a thick arbour, &amp;c.</L> 
<L>Next thereunto did growe a goodly tree.</L></Q></P>
<P>On this tree, he adds, grew golden apples; and that from this
likewise sprung the tree of the Hesperides; but these circumstances,
as also that of Proserpina's garden, &amp;c. is, I think, not to be
justified from an∣tient writers. He afterwards informs us, that the gold∣en
apples by which Acontius won Cydippe, and that which Ate threw among the Gods,
were gather'd from <PB N="56" REF="59"/> this tree: but these, as we learn
from many passages in the Classics, were the produce of the Hesperian
tree abovemention'd. He then tells us, that the branches of this tree
overspread the river Cocytus, in which Tantalus was plung'd up to the chin,
who was perpe∣tually catching at its fruit, in which he copies Ho∣mer, in
some measure; who acquaints us, that many trees of delicious fruit wav'd
over the lake in which Tantalus was plac'd; but it does not appear, from him,
that Tantalus was fix'd in Cocytus, but in some lake peculiarly appropriated
to his punishment. 
<Q> 
<L><GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.—</L></Q></P>
<P>Spenser has also made another use of Cocytus, viz. that the
shores of Cocytus perpetually resounded with the shrieks of damned
ghosts, who underwent an ever∣lasting punishment by being dipt in its
waters. Co∣cytus, indeed, says antient fable, must be past, before there
is any possibility of arriving at the infernal re∣gions; but we do not
find, that it was a punishment allotted to any of the ghosts, to be thus
plung'd into its waves; nor that this circumstance was the cause of the
cries which echoed around its banks.</P>
<P>What he has invented of Cocytus, exhibits a fine image: he
supposes, that when Sir Guyon came to this river, 
<Q> 
<L>—He clomb up to the bank</L> 
<L>And looking downe sawe many damned wights</L> 
<L>In those sad waves; which direfull deadly stanke,</L> 
<L><PB N="57" REF="60"/>Plonged continually of cruel
sprights,</L> 
<L>That with their pittious cries, and yelling shrights,</L> 
<L>They made the further shore resounden wide.</L> 
<BIBL>St. 57.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>The antients tell us, that the golden apple, for which the
goddesses strove on mount Ida, was pluck'd in the garden of the
Hesperides; but Spenser's allego∣rising imagination feigns, that it grew
in hell. He might probably receive the hint of this tree with the golden apples
from Homer's mention of various trees which grew in hell, near the lake of
Tantalus, hinted at above; but the silver stool beneath it is en∣tirely his
own, which Mammon persuades the knight to seat himself upon, and is A NEW
CIRCUMSTANCE of TEMPTATION. 
<Q> 
<L>—Thou fearfull foole,</L> 
<L>Why takest not of that same fruit of gold;</L> 
<L>Ne sittest downe on that same silver stoole,</L> 
<L>To rest thy weary person in the shadow coole?</L>

<P>Britomartis, among the Cretans, was another name for Diana, the

represented as the patroness of Chastity. It is not improbable, as our
author has copied the greatest part of the second Canto of this book from
the Ceiris of Virgil, that he learn'd, from the same poem, that Britomartis
was a name for Diana, viz. 
<Q> 
<L><HI>Dictynnam dixere</HI> tuo <HI>de nomine Lunam.</HI></L> 
<BIBL>v. 305.</BIBL></Q> She was a Cretan nymph, and the daughter
of Jupi∣ter and Charme, whom Virgil has introduced, in his Ceiris, as the
nurse of Scylla, and from whom our <PB N="61" REF="64"/> author has copied his
Glauce, Britomart's nurse, in the Canto mentioned above. She was called
Dictyn∣na, because she invented nets for hunting, which be∣ing also one
of Diana's names, Britomartis and Dia∣na were look'd upon as the same.
Callimachus speaks of her as one of the nymphs of Diana's train, but
observes, that she was called by the Cydonians, Dic∣tynna. He has left us
the history of Britomartis in his hymn to Diana.

<P><PB N="67" REF="70"/>Most of the antient writers who relate the
story of Hylas, mention the circumstance of Hylas's name being often
re-echo'd by the hills, &amp;c. when it was so loudly and frequently call'd
upon by Hercules; but I do not recollect that any of them speak of the nymphs
as repeating his name. With regard to the for∣mer particular, Antonius has
given us an ex∣plication of it, not generally known, from the
<GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> of Nicander. 
<Q REND="inline">"Hercules (says he) having made the hills and
forrests tremble, by calling so mightily on the name Hylas; the nymphs who
had snatch'd him away, fearing lest the enraged lo∣ver should at last
discover Hylas in their fountain, transformed him into Echo, which answer'd
<HI>Hylas</HI> to every call of Hercules."</Q> This solution throws a new
light on the circumstance of Hylas's name being so often eccho'd back, and
which is particularly insisted on by Virgil, Eclog. 6. v. 44. by
Propertius, in his E∣legy De Raptu Hylae, 1. 20. and by Valerius Flaccus, b. 7.
v. 593. On account of the many invocations of his name, said to be made by
Hercules, and of its being so often re-eccho'd, I suppose a custom,
men∣tion'd by Solinus, was every year celebrated on the banks of the lake
Hylas.

<P>Scaliger finds great fault with the subject of this song,
and prefers to it the subject of Orpheus's song in Valerius Flaccus. 
<Q REND="inline">"Longe enim aptius [Orpheus] canit, apud

<BIBL>Poet. B. 5. c. 6.</BIBL></Q> But by this piece of
criticism, Scaliger has great∣ly betray'd his ignorance of the nature of
antient Poesy, and of the character of Orpheus. 
<Q REND="inline">"In the early ages of the Grecian state
(says the admirable author of the Enquiry into the life and writings of
Homer) the wild and barbarous inhabitants wanted the assistance of the
Muses to soften and tame them. They stood in need of being impressed
with an awe of superior and irresistible powers, and a liking to social
life. They wanted a mythology to lead them by fear and dread (the only holds to
be taken of a rude multitude) into a feeling of natural causes, and their
influence upon our lives and actions. The wise and good among the antients
saw this ne∣cessity, and supplied it; the oldest of the inspired
train were the 
<Q> 
<L>—PII VATES, <HI>&amp; Phaebo digna
locuti.</HI></L></Q> They had religion for their theme, and the service of
mankind for their song". 
<BIBL>Sect. 6.</BIBL></Q> And in another place, the same
author acquaints us, that all the poems of Orpheus were 
<Q REND="inline">"philosophical, prophetical, and religious."

<BIBL>Sect. 7.</BIBL></Q> Thus the conduct of Apollo∣nius was
highly consistent, in attributing a song to Orpheus, whose subject
was philosophy and religion. And it was for the same reason that
Onomacritus, in his Argonautics, v. 419. many years before Apollonius,
represented Orpheus singing the origin of the Gods, and the creation of
things, in his contest with Chiron.</P> 
<P>But the propriety of the subject of this song is easily
to be defend∣ed without considering the character of Orpheus. The occasion
of this song was a quarrel among the Argonauts, whom Orpheus en∣deavours to
pacify with the united powers of music and verse. Up∣on which account
says the Scholiast, 
<Q REND="inline"><GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</Q> To this it may be added, that a song whose subject is
likewise religious, and which asserts the right of Jupiter to the
possession of Olympus, was even expedient, as one of the chiefs had but
just before spoken blasphemy against him.

were the auditors of this song of so mean a rank as Scaliger would
represent them; he terms them VIRI MILITARES; but it should be
consider'd, that they were PRINCES and DEMI-GODS.</P> 
<P>But whether the subject of Orpheus's song in Apollonius be
good or bad, there is one circumstance belonging to it, which gives it a
manifest superiority to that of Orpheus in Valerius Flaccus, I mean the
design of it, which was to repress the vehemence of the passions, at
once so agreeable to the well-known character of Orpheus, and so
expressive of the irresistible influence of music. In the Latin poet
Orpheus sings upon no occasion, and to no end, unless it be to make the
night pass away more pleasantly.

<HEAD>SECT. IV. Of Spenser's Stanza, Versification, and
Language.</HEAD>
<P>ALthough Spenser's favourite Chaucer had made use of the
ottave Rime 
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Chaucer's Stanza is not STRICTLY
so.</NOTE> or Stanza of eight lines, yet it is most probable, that our
author was induced to make choice of it (with the addition of one line) from
the example of Tasso and Ariosto, who were the most fashionable poets
of his age. But Spenser, in making this choice of his stanza, seems not
suffi∣ciently to have consider'd the genius of the English language,
which will not easily admit of that more frequent repetition of the same
termination, which <PB N="82" REF="85"/> this stanza requires; a
circumstance not difficult in the Italian, which deals largely in identical
cadences.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">I am obliged to the admirable author
of the Rambler for this observation.</NOTE> This constraint led our author
into many absurdities. For example, 
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. It necessitated him to dilate the thing to be
ex∣prest, however unimportant, with trifling and insipid circumlocutions,
viz. 
<Q> 
<L>Now hath faire Phaebe with her silver face,</L> 
<L>Thrice seene the shadows of the nether world,</L> 
<L>Sith last I left that honorable place,</L> 
<L>In which her royal presence is enroll'd.</L> 
<BIBL>2. 3. 44.</BIBL></Q> That is, 
<Q REND="inline">"it is three months since I left her
palace."</Q></ITEM>
<ITEM> II. It obliged him, when matter fail'd him to∣wards the
close of his Stanza, to run into a ridiculous redundancy and repetition of
words, viz. 
<Q> 
<L>In which was nothing pourtrahed nor wrought,</L> 
<L>Nor wrought, nor pourtrahed, but easie to be
thought.</L> 
<BIBL>2. 9. 33.</BIBL></Q></ITEM>
<ITEM> III. It forc'd him, in order to make out his com∣plement
of rhymes to introduce a puerile or imperti∣nent idea, viz. 
<Q> 
<L>Not that proud towre of Troy tho' richly GILT,</L> 
<BIBL>2. 9. 45.</BIBL></Q> In this line, being laid under a
necessity of producing somewhat consonant to <HI>spilt</HI> and
<HI>built,</HI> which went be∣fore, <PB N="83" REF="86"/> he has given us an
image at once little and im∣proper. And to the difficulty of his stanza, I
think we may impute the great number of his Ellipses, some of which will be
pointed out in another place.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Notwithstanding these absurdities flow from Spen∣ser's
stanza, yet it must be own'd that some ad∣vantages arise from it; and
we may venture to affirm, that the fullness and significancy of Spenser's
descrip∣tions is often owing to the prolixity of his stanza, and the
multitude of his rhymes. The discerning reader is desired to consider the
following stanza as an instance of what is here advanced. Guyon is binding
Furor. 
<Q> 
<L>With hundred iron chaines he did him bind</L> 
<L>And hundred knots, which did him sore constraine;</L> 
<L>Yet his great iron teeth he still did grind,</L> 
<L>And grimly gnash, threatening revenge in vaine:</L> 
<L>His burning eyen, whom bloudie strakes did staine,</L> 
<L>Stared full wide, and threw forth sparkes of fire;</L> 
<L>And more for ranke despight, than for great paine,</L> 
<L>Shakt his long locks colour'd like copper wire,</L> 
<L>And bit his tawny beard, to shew his raging ire.</L> 
<BIBL>2. 4. 15.</BIBL></Q> In this stanza there are some
images which are, per∣haps, the consequence of a multiplicity of rhymes. 
<Q> 
<L>He all that night, that too long night did passe,</L> 
<L>And now the day out of the ocean-maine</L> 
<L><PB N="84" REF="87"/>Began to peep above this earthly
masse,</L> 
<L>With pearly dew sprinkling the morning grasse;</L> 
<L>Then up he rose like heavy lump of leade,</L> 
<L>That in his face, as in a looking glasse,</L> 
<L>The signes of anguish one might plainely reade.</L> 
<BIBL>3. 5. 26.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>Dryden, I think, somewhere remarks, that rhyme often helped him
to a thought; an observation, which, probably, Spenser's experience had
likewise supplied him with: Spenser, however, must have found more
convenience, in this respect, from writing in rhyme, than Dryden, in
proportion as the stanza of the for∣mer obliged him to a more repeated use
of it.</P>
<P>In speaking of Spenser's rhyme, it ought to be re∣mark'd, that
he often new-spells a word to make it rhyme more precisely. Take these
specimens. 
<Q>

deny, <HI>pervart</HI> for pervert, <HI>heare</HI> for hair, and numberless
other instances of the orthography being destroyed for the rhyme-sake.
This was a liberty which Chaucer, Gower, and Lyd∣gate frequently made use of;
and it may not be im∣proper in this place to exhibit the sentiments of a 
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The author of the Arte of English
poesie.</NOTE> critic in Q. Elizabeth's age upon it. 
<Q REND="inline">"Now there cannot be in a maker a fowler fault
than to falsifie his accent to serve his cadence; or by untrue orthography
to wrench his words to help his rhyme; for it is a sign that such a maker
is not copious is his own lan∣guage".</Q>—However he seems afterwards
to allow the deviation from true spelling, in some measure. 
<Q REND="inline">"It <PB N="86" REF="89"/> is somewhat more
tollerable to help the rhyme by false orthographie, than to leave an
unpleasant dissonance to the eare, by keeping trewe orthographie and
losing the rime; as for example, it is better to rime <HI>dore</HI> with
restore, than in his true orthographie which is doore.—Such men were in
effect the most part of all your old rimers, and 'specially Gower, who to
make up his rime would for the most part write his termi∣nant syllable with
false orthographie; and many times not sticke to put in a plaine French
word for an English; and so by your leave do many of our com∣mon rymers at
this day."<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>B. 2. c. 8.</BIBL></NOTE></Q>
We find in many passages of our author the orthography violated, when the
rhyme without such an expedient would be very exact; thus BITE when made to
rhyme with DELIGHT is some∣times spelt BIGHT, as if the eye could be
satisfy'd in this case as well as the ear. Instances of this sort
oc∣cur often in Harrington's Ariosto, and more particu∣larly of the word
<HI>said,</HI> which is often occasionally written SED. This practice was
continued as far down as the age of Milton. 
<Q> 
<L>Besides what the grim wolf with privy paw</L> 
<L>Daily devours apace, and nothing SED.</L></Q> <HI>Said</HI> is
thus printed SED in the edition of 1645, that it might appear to rhyme, with
greater propriety, to the preceding <HI>spread:</HI> later editors, not
know∣ing the fashion of writing <HI>said,</HI> upon some occasions,
SED, alter'd it to <HI>fed,</HI> which utterly destroy'd the 
<PB N="87" REF="90"/> sense. The same spelling is met with again in the
same edition, and for the same reason, in L'Allegro. 
<Q> 
<L>She was pincht and pull'd she SED,</L> 
<L>And he by friars lantern <HI>led.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>Hughes, not considering our author's custom of
mis∣spelling a word for the convenience of rhyme, makes him frequently
guilty of some very bad rhymes; for that editor (among other examples of his
correctness) has reduced Spenser's text to modern orthography with great
accuracy.</P>
<P>It is indeed surprising, upon the whole, that our author
should have been able to execute a poem of such a length as the FAERIE
QUEENE with so much spirit, laden with so many shackles, and opprest
with so grievous a BONDAGE OF RIMING. I do not re∣member that he has been
so inaccurate, as to make the same word rhyme to itself in more than four
or five instances; a fault, which if he had committed very frequently, his
many beauties of versification would have obliged us to overlook; and which
Har∣rington should more frequently have avoided, to compensate, in some
measure, for the tameness and prosaic mediocrity of his numbers.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding our author's affectation 
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The author of the Arte of English
poesie, seems to have cen∣sur'd this practice of Spencer, 
<Q REND="inline">"Our maker therefore, at these dayes, shall

<BIBL>B. 3. C. 1.</BIBL></Q> The Faerie Queene was not
published when this critic wrote, so that this censure is levelled at the
Pastorals, which, however, in another place he has commended.

of obso∣lete phrases and words, yet it may be affirm'd, that 
<PB N="88" REF="91"/> his style is, in general, perspicuous, flowing, and
exuberant. His Pastorals are written in a profess'd imitation of the
style of Chaucer, of which he has taken care to acquaint us, in the beginning
of Colin Clouts Come Home Again. 
<Q>

Pastoral he hints at his having copied Chaucer. 
<Q> 
<L>That Colin hight which well could pipe and sing,</L> 
<L>For he of Tityrus his songs did lere.</L></Q> 
<PB N="89" REF="92"/> He even seems, in the Pastorals, to have attempt∣ed an
imitation of the visions 
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"> 
<P>The author of the Visions of PIERCE PLOWMAN is Roberte
Longelande, or Langelande, according to Bale, Script. Brit. Cent. 6. 37. &amp;
Wood, Hist. &amp; Antiq. Univ. Oxon. B. 2. pag. 106. who likewise calls him
Malverne. It is plain that his poem, called the VISIONS of P. PLOWMAN, was
publish'd after the Year 1350, from this passage in it, 
<Q> 
<L>In Date of our bryghte, in a drye Apriell</L> 
<L>A thousand and three hundred twyse twentye and ten</L>

<L>My wafers ther wer geisen, when Chichester was
Mair.</L> 
<BIBL>Pass. 13.</BIBL></Q> So that several of Gower's
and Chaucer's pieces made their appear∣ance before it. It is divided into
twenty parts (PASSUS, as he styles them;) and consists of many distinct
visions, which have no mutual dependance upon each other; so that the poem
is not a regular and uniform whole, consisting of one action or design.
The author seems to have intended it as a satire on almost every
occupation of life, but more particularly on the clergy; in censuring whom,
Wickliff had led the way not many years before. This piece abounds with humour,
spirit, and imagination; all which are drest to great disadvantage in a
very uncouth versification, and obsolete language. It seems to be written
without rhyme, an ornament which the poet has endeavour'd to supply, by
making every verse to consist of words beginning with the same letter.
This practice has contributed not a little to render his poem obscure and
per∣plex'd, exclusive of its obsolete style; for to introduce his
allitera∣tion, he must have been often necessarily compell'd to depart
from the natural and more obvious way of expressing himself. The learned
Dr. Hickes observes, that this alliterative versification was drawn by
Langland from the practice of the Saxon poets, and that these visions
abound with many Saxonisms. 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>Haec obiter ex satyrographo nostro,

this of their alliteration. 
<Q REND="inline">"Quorum in primis se observandum offert
dictionum ab eadem ini∣tiali litera incipientium usus non infrequens." 
<BIBL>cap. 23. pag. 195.</BIBL></Q> From this it appears,
that the example of Gower and Chaucer, who sought to reform the roughness
of their native tongue, by naturaliz∣ing many new words from the Latin, French,
and Italian, and who introduced the seven-lin'd stanza, from Petrarch and
Dante, into our poetry, had little influence upon Longland, who chose rather
to go back to the Saxon models, both for language and form of verse.</P> 
<P>The curious reader may not, perhaps, be displeased with a
spe∣cimen of the introduction to the first vision. 
<Q REND="inline">"The poet (shadowed by the name and
character of Peter, or Piers, a plowman) re∣presents himself as weary with
wandering, on a May-morning, and at last laid down to sleep by the side
of a brook; where, in a vision, he sees a stately tower upon a hill, with
a dungeon, and dark dismal ditches belonging to it, and a very deep dale
under the hill. Before the tower a large field or plain is supposed, filled
with men of every rank and occupation, all being respectively engag'd in
their several pursuits; when suddenly a beautifull lady appears to him,
and unravels to him the mystery of what he had seen."</Q></P> 
<P>As a specimen of his manner, the reader is desir'd to
accept some of the verses of which I have just given an analysis. 
<Q> 
<L>In a summer season, when sette was the sun,</L> 
<L>I shoupe me into the shroubes as I a shepe were;</L>

<L>In habit as a hermet, unholie of werkes,</L> 
<L>Went wide into the world wonders to hear,</L> 
<L>And on a May-morning, on Malverne-hylles,</L> 
<L>Me befel a ferly, a fairy methought</L> 
<L>I was wery a wandring, &amp;c.</L> 
<BIBL>Pass. 1. v. 1. &amp;c.</BIBL></Q> In these
verses there is a manifest contradiction; for the poet says, that the SUN
was SETT, and that it was a MAY-MORNING. How∣ever, it is plain, that in the
first line, instead of SETTE <HI>was the sun,</HI> we should read, 
<Q> 
<L>—When HOTTE was the Sun.</L></Q> For Bale [ubi
supra] speaking of this work, thus translates the first line of it, 
<Q> 
<L><HI>In aestivo tempore cum Sol</HI> CALERET.</L></Q> And
it should be remember'd, that Bale had an opportunity of quoting from the
most original editions.</P> 
<P>Before every vision the manner of circumstances of his
falling asleep, are distinctly describ'd; before one of them in
particular, P. Plowman is suppos'd, with equal humour and satire, to fall
asleep while he is bidding his beads. In the course of the poem, the
satire is carried on by means of several allegoric personages, such as
MEDE, SIMONY, CONSCIENCE, SLOTH, &amp;c. The learned Selden (notes on Polyolb.
S. 11.) mentions this author with ho∣nour; and by Hickes he is frequently
styled, 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>Celeberrimus ille saty∣rographus, morum
vindex acerrimus, &amp;c.</HI></Q> Leland seems to have con∣founded this poem
with Chaucer's PLOWMAN'S TALE. Speaking of two editions of Chaucer, he adds, 
<Q REND="inline">"Sed PETRI ARATORIS FABULA, quae communi
doctorum consensu Chaucero, tan∣quam, vero parenti, attribuitur, in utraque
editione, quia malos sacerdotum mores vehementer increpavit, suppressa
est." 
<BIBL>Com∣ment. de Script. Brit. cap. 55.</BIBL></Q> Chaucer,
indeed, in the PLOW∣MAN'S TALE, seems to have copied from our author.</P> 
<P>I shall conclude this note with a short extract from Bale;

<PB N="91" REF="94"/> And besides, that his Pastorals might appear a more
complete specimen of a work in old English, he has given them the title of
an old book called the SHEP∣HEARD'S KALENDER, first printed by Wynkin a 
<PB N="92" REF="95"/> Worde, and reprinted about twenty years before our author
published his Pastorals, viz. 1559. Hence, says E. K. in his Epistle
prefix'd, 
<Q REND="inline">"He tearmeth it the SHEPHERD's KALENDER, applying
an old name to a new work."</Q> One of Spenser's reasons for using so
much antient phraseology in these Pastorals, was undoubtedly with a
design to stamp a Doric, or rather rustic simplicity upon them; but the
princi∣pal one was that which is deliver'd by his friend and commentator<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ibid.</BIBL></NOTE>, 
<Q REND="inline">"who was privie to all his designs",</Q> E. K. 
<Q REND="inline">"In myne opinion, says he, it is one especiall
prayse of many which are due to this poet, that he hath labour'd to
restore, as to their rightfull heri∣tage, such good and naturall English
words, as have been long time out of use, and almost cleane disherited;
which is the onely cause that our mother-tongue, which truly of itselfe is
both ful enough for prose, and stately enough for verse, hath long time
beene counted most bare and barren of both; which default, when as some
have endevored <PB N="93" REF="96"/> to salve and recure, they patched up the
holes with peeces and ragges of other languages; borrowing here of the French,
there of the Italian, and every where of the Latine; not weighing how ill
those tongues accord with themselves, but much worse with ours; so now
they have made our Englishe tongue a gallimaufrey, or hodge-podge of all
other speeches."</Q> Thus that which induced Spenser to adopt so much
obsolete language in the Pastorals, induced him likewise to do the same
in the FAERIE QUEENE. Hence it is manifest, that he was disgusted with
the practice of his cotemporary writers, who had adulterated, according to his
judgement, the purity of the British tongue by various innovations from the
Spanish, French, Latin, and Italian. And that this was the case in the age
of Queen Elizabeth will appear from the following passages. Thus Marston
in his satires.

<P>The same author acquains us, that about this time an
infinite number of Italian books were translated into English: among the
rest, were many Italian novels, the translations of which, Shake∣spere
manifestly made use of for some of his plots. Those who have undertaken
to point out the books from whence Shakespere borrow'd his plots, have not, I
think, been able to discover the source from whence he drew the story of
his MERCHANT of VE∣NICE; which, in all probability, is founded upon the
following antient ballad, which I met with in a large collection.</P> 
<P>A SONG, shewing the crueltie of Gernutus a JEWE, who lending
to a marchant an hundred crownes, would have a pound of his fleshe, because
he could not pay him at the time appointed. 
<Q> 
<LG>
<L>In Venice towne not long agoe,</L>
<L>A cruell Jewe did dwell;</L>
<L>Which lived all on usurie,</L>
<L>As Italian writers tell.</L>
</LG> 
<LG>
<L>GERNUTUS called was the Jewe, &amp;c.</L>
</LG></Q> The whole song would be too prolix for this
place; I shall tran∣scribe only the close of the story; having
premis'd, that the cunning and rapacious Jew is represented, in our ballad,
to have lent an eminent merchant of Venice an hundred crowns, upon a bond, in
which promise of payment is made within a year and a day; under the
forfeiture of a pound of the merchant's flesh, in case of non-payment; that
the merchant, on account of his ships being de∣tain'd by adverse winds, was
unable to perform his contract at the time appointed; that the affair was
referr'd to a judge; that the friends of the merchant offer'd ten thousand
crowns to absolve him, but that the Jew obstinately persisted in his
demand of the forfeited pound of flesh. 
<Q> 
<LG>
<L>Then said the judge, Yet good, my friend,</L>
<L>Let me of you desire,</L>
</LG> 
<LG>
<L>To take the flesh from such a place</L>
<L>As yet you let him live;</L>

<L>And as he was about to strike</L>
<L>In him the deadlie blow,</L>
<L>Stay (quoth the judge) thy crueltie,</L>
<L>I charge thee to doe so.</L>

</LG></Q> After which follows a moral exhortation,
resulting from the subject.</P> 
<P>It may be objected, that this ballad might have been written
after, and copied from, Shakespere's play. But if that had been the case,
it is most likely that the author would have preserved Shakespere's name
of Shylock for the Jew; and nothing is more likely, than that Shakespere in
copying from this ballad, should alter the name from Gernutus to one more
Jewish; and by the alteration of the name his imitation was the better
disguised. Another argument (which would have appeared much more
convincing, had the whole song been transcrib'd, but which perhaps will be
allowed from this extract) is, that our ballad has the air of a narrative
written before Shakespere's play; I mean, that, if it had been written after
the play, it would have been much more full and circumstantial: At present,
it has too much the nakedness of an original. Besides, the first stanza
informs us, that the story was taken from some Italian novel. Thus much
therefore is certain, that is, Shakespere either copied from that Italian
novel, or from this ballad: Now we have no translation, I presume, of
such a novel into English; if then it be granted that Shakespere
generally took his Italian stories from their English translations, and
that the arguments above, concerning the prior antiquity of this ballad are
true, it will follow that Shake∣spere copied from this ballad.</P> 
<P>I shall only add, that it appears from S. Gosson's
Schoole of Abuse, printed 1579; that the character of a cruell and covetous
Jewe had been exhibited with good applause before Shakespere's Shylock
appear'd. The author is commending some plays, and among the rest, 
<Q REND="inline">"The JEWE and Ptolome shewne at the bull;
the one representing the greedinesse of wordly chusers, and bloudy
minds of usurers, the other, &amp;c.".</Q></P></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="98"/>Our author's disapprobation of this practice
may be made to appear more fully from his own words, <PB N="96" REF="99"/> where
he hints that Chaucer's language (which he so closely copied) was the pure
English.

corrupt adul∣teration of style, so fashionable in is age, yet we find 
<PB N="97" REF="100"/> him notwithstanding, frequently introducing words from
a foreign tongue such, as, visnomie, amen∣ance, <PB N="98" REF="101"/>
arret, mespise, sovenance, afrap, aguise, a∣menage, abase, and the
like; but these words the frequent return of his rhyme obliged him to
intro∣duce, and accordingly they will generally be found at the end of his
lines. Thus the poverty of our tongue (or rather the unfrequency of identical
termi∣nations in it) often compelled him for the sake of rhyme, to coin new
English words, such as damni∣fy'd, unmercify'd, wonderment, warriment,
unruli∣ment, habitaunce, hazardrie, &amp;c. &amp;c. To this cause his many
latinisms may likewise be attributed, which, like the rest, are
substituted to make out the necessary jingle.</P>
<P>The censure of B. Johnson, upon our author's style, is
perhaps unreasonable, 
<Q REND="inline">"Spenser, in affecting the antients, writ no
language."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Discoveries.</BIBL></NOTE></Q> The
ground-work <PB N="99" REF="102"/> and substance of his style, is the
language of the age in which he lived; this indeed is season'd with
va∣rious expressions deduced from a remote age, but in such a manner,
that the language of his age was ra∣ther strengthened and dignified, than
debas'd or dis∣guis'd by such a practice. In truth, the affectation of
Spenser in this point, is by no means so striking and visible as
Johnson has insinuated; nor is our author so obsolete in his style,
as he is generally thought, or represented to be. For many stanzas together
we may frequently read him with as much facility, as we can the same number
of lines in Shake∣spere. But tho' I cannot subscribe to the opinion of
the last-quoted critic, concerning our author's recourse to the antients,
yet I must confess, that the fol∣lowing sentiments, relating to the
same subject, are admirable. 
<Q REND="inline">"Words borrow'd of antiquity do lend a kind of

circumstances.

<L>The mirre also that wepith ever' of kinde</L> 
<L>The cedris hie, as upright as a line.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>V. 66.</BIBL></NOTE></L></Q> Spenser, perhaps, in having
given us this minute and particular enumeration of various trees, has incurred
a smaller share of censure than some of the Roman authors mentioned
above. In some of them, indeed, such a description will be found
superfluous and im∣pertinent; but, upon this occasion, it is highly
con∣sistent, and, indeed, expedient, that the poet should dwell, for
some time, on the beauty of this grove, in describing its variety of trees,
as that circumstance tends to draw the red-cross knight and his compa∣nion
farther and farther into the shade, 'till at length <PB N="102" REF="105"/>
they are imperceptibly invited to the cave of error, which stood in the
thickest part of it: in short, this description is so far from being
puerile, or ill-placed, that it serves to improve, and help out the allegory.
But notwithstanding this may be affirm'd, in com∣mendation of Spenser, yet
I am apt to think, that the impropriety of introducing such a description,
would not have appear'd a sufficient reason to our poet, why he should
not have admitted it; for his judgment was so greatly overwhelm'd by his
imagination, that he could never neglect the opportunity of a good
de∣scription, whenever it presented itself. The reader will excuse my
producing another passage from Chaucer, in which he ridicules, with no
less humour than judg∣ment, the particular detail of trees, and of the
circum∣stances which follow'd upon their being fell'd, given us by one of the
above-mention'd antient poets. He is speaking of Arcite's funeral.

calls this addition of Spenser to Chaucer's fragment a completion of the
squier's tale; but it is certainly nothing more than a completion of one part

intended likewise to tell us,

disquisition concerning the miracles wrought by the means of this wonderful
steed, than it is matter of concern, to reflect, that Chaucer's description
of them is utterly lost; especially as we may reasonably con∣clude, from
the remaining parts of this tale, that those which are perish'd, must
have discover'd no less striking efforts of the imagination. It appears,
that Milton was particularly fond of this poem, and that he was not a little
desirous of knowing the end of a story which promis'd so many beauties;
in his Il Pen∣seroso, he invokes Melancholy to

not for this reason, that he might tell that part of the HALF-TOLD tale which

follows,

but they are all to be produced in MSS. namely, his POETICAL VISION, his ALARM

been consulting Chaucer's Assembly of fowles for this description of
NATURE. But Spenser has given many new and delicate touches to Chaucer's
rough sketch, as will appear upon comparison.

Mars, for the conve∣nience of rhyme, since he had the authority of Chau∣cer
for it.

de deriv'd from the French <HI>ar∣ranger</HI>; so that to darraine battle is,
to set the battle in array. Our poet has used arrang'd (from
<HI>arranger</HI>) and applied it to battle more than once. 
<Q> 
<L>So both to battel fierce ARRANGED are.</L> 
<BIBL>1. 2. 36.</BIBL></Q> 
<Q>

darraine in a sense not agreeable to its genuine signification.

TO DETERMINE. This word being a Chaucerism, our author has very remarkably
affected the use of it, viz.

<Q>

<Q> 
<L>—Those giants, which did warre DARRAINE</L> 
<L>Against the heavens.—</L>

<L>—How best he mote DARRAINE</L> 
<L>That enterprize.—</L> 
<BIBL>4. 9. 4.</BIBL></Q> But we are told, in the glossary to
Chaucer, (Urry's edit.) that this word, among other senses, signifies,
<HI>to dare, to attempt.</HI> Thus, by a gradual detortion, and by an
imperceptible progression from one kindred sense to another, a word, at
length, attains a meaning en∣tirely foreign to its original etymology.</P>
<P>Spenser's frequent use of DARRAINE seems to have somewhat
familiaris'd it in Queen Elizabeth's age. We meet with it in Shakespere, who
probably drew it from our author.

<L>His GLITTERAND armor shined far away.</L></Q> Spenser thus

<L>In GLITTERANDE gold, of great array<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>V. 2073.</BIBL></NOTE></L></Q> And in the same poem.

the active participle very frequently in the antient Scotch poets.

join two negatives, when no affirmation is intended. Hickes, after

words unnoticed, which appear likewise in Chau∣cer; but which are no more the
property of him, than they are of Lidgate, of Gower, and of the au∣thor of
Piers Plowman; so that it would be difficult in some cases to ascertain
and mark out the particular source from which our author drew; however it is
manifest that he had the most frequent recourse to, and drew the
largest draughts from Chaucer, 
<Q> 
<L>—The well of English undefilde.</L></Q></P>
<P>I cannot dismiss this section without a wish, that this
neglected author whom Spenser proposed in some mea∣sure, as the pattern
of his language, and to whom he is not a little indebted for many noble
strokes of poetry should be more universally and attentively studied.
Chau∣cer seems to be regarded rather as an old poet, than as a good one, and
that he wrote English verses four hundred years ago seems more frequently
to be urged in his commendation, than that he wrote four hun∣dred years ago
with taste and judgment. We look upon his poems rather as venerable relics,
than as finish'd patterns; as pieces calculated rather to gratify the
antiquarian than the critic. When I sate down to read Chaucer with the
curiosity of knowing how the first English poet wrote, I left him with
the satisfaction of having found what later and more refin'd ages could
hardly equal in true humour, pathos, or sublimity. It must 
<PB N="142" REF="145"/> be confest that his uncouth or rather unfamiliar
lan∣guage has deterr'd many from perusing him; but at the same time it
must be allowed, that nothing has more contributed to his being little looked
into, than the convenient opportunity of reading him with faci∣lity in modern
imitations. Thus when translation (for such may imitations from Chaucer be
call'd) be∣comes substituted as the means of attaining the knowledge of any
difficult and antient author, the original not only begins to be neglected and
excluded as less easy, but also to be despised as less ornamental
and elegant. And thus tho' Mr. Pope's translation of Homer is perhaps the
best that ever was made of any author, yet it has so far indulg'd the
laziness or illi∣teracy of many readers, as to tempt them to acquiesce in
the knowledge of Homer acquir'd by it, as suffici∣ent; and thus many have
preferr'd that translation to the Graecian text, in proportion as the former
contains more frequent and more shining metaphors, more lively
descriptions, and in general appears to be more full, elaborate, and
various.</P>

<P>THIS circumstance of the Red-cross knight and Una meeting with

<P>This illusion effected by Archimago, who discovers a
fictitious Una to the Red-cross Knight in the em∣braces of a young 'squire,
seems to be imitated from the deceptions carried on in the enchanted castle
of Atlanta, where many of the guests are impos'd upon by false
representations of the persons of their friends or mistresses; and
more particularly from that passage where Orlando, after having been
cheated with the appearance of a fictitious Angelica, is made to hear her cry
out for his assistance, as if some villain was ravishing her, &amp;c.

love into hate; but it appears from this <PB N="153" REF="156"/> passage in
Ariosto, that he drank of that fountain which produc'd the contrary effect.
However it is manifest, that our author alludes to another place in
Ariosto, where Renaldo drinks of that fountain which produc'd the effect here
describ'd by Spenser. C. 42. S. 63.

<P>It has been before remark'd, that Spenser in his BLATANT BEAST
had some reference to the story of the <HI>questing</HI> beast
mention'd in the romance of MORTE ARTHUR. Yet, notwithstanding, I am apt to
think, that Spenser in representing scandal under the shape of a
monstrous and unnatural beast, imitated, or ra∣ther vyed with Ariosto,
who has represented avarice and jealousy under the picture of two hideous
beasts; the first of which, like the BLATANT BEAST attacks all estates
alike, enters the palace as well the cottage, but vents his rage in a more
particular manner against the clergy, sparing not even the pope himself.
She is at last supposed to be bound by Leo the tenth, as Jealousy is
supposed to be driven to her den by Renaldo. It is not improbable, that
Ariosto, in adumbrating these violent passions under the figure of
beasts, form'd of many unnatural combinations, might have an eye to the
beast in the REVELA∣TIONS, which 
<Q REND="inline">"rose out of the sea, having seven heads,
and ten horns, and upon his horns ten crowns, and upon his heads the name of
blasphemy; and <PB N="156" REF="159"/> the beast which I saw was like unto

<P>I had almost forget to take notice, that our author, in his
Radegunde with her city of females, probably had an eye upon Ariosto's land
of Amazons.</P>
<P>But although Spenser appears to have imitated, and
consequently to have admir'd Ariosto, from a survey of the preceding
instances; and to have been ambi∣tious of rivalling the Orlando Furioso, in
composing a poem upon a kindred and similar plan; yet it may be affirmed,
that they were both of a genius entirely different. Spenser, amidst all his
absurdities, abounds with beautiful and sublime representations; while
A∣riosto's strokes of true poetry bear a very signal dis∣proportion, in
their number, to his sallies of roman∣tic imagination: he gives us the
grotesque for the graceful, and extravagance for majesty: he frequent∣ly
moves our laughter and surprise by the whimsical figures of a Callot, but
seldom awakens our admira∣tion by the just portraits of a Raphael. To
confess the truth, Ariosto's vein is so far different from Spen∣ser's,
that it is absolutely comic, and infinitely better suited to scenes of
humour, than to serious and so∣lemn description; he so greatly excels
in painting the familiar manners, that what are call'd his tales, are, by far,
the most shining passages in his poem. Many of <PB N="158" REF="161"/>
his similes are likewise the strongest indications of his turn for
burlesque.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Thus the magician disclosing his
enchanted shield, to dazzle the fight of Bradamante, is compar'd to a cat
wantonly playing with a mouse, and at last killing it. C. 4. S. 22. Rogero
fighting with the orc, a sea-monster, is compar'd to a fly attacking a
mastiff, and attempting to sting him in various parts of his body. C. 10.
S. 105. Alzirdo being slain by Orlando, his soldiers are said to make a
noise like that of a herd of swine, when a wolf has seiz'd one of their
little pigs, <HI>un tener porco.</HI> C. 12. S. 78. Zerbino hav∣ing first
insulted Gabrina, and afterwards addressing her in a gentle manner, is
compar'd to a dog, who at first furiously assaults a stran∣ger, but
afterwards, a crust being thrown to him, fawns upon him. C. 20. S. 139.
Orlando and Mandricard fighting together, their weapons being broke to pieces,
are compar'd to two peasants who are drubbing each other, having quarrell'd
about a water-course, or boundary of land. C. 23. S. 83. Other examples of
this sort are obvious to a reader of Ariosto.</NOTE></P>
<P>But if there should be any readers, who, from some of the
fictions in Orlando, would prove that its author was possess'd of an
extensive and magnifi∣cent invention, let them remember, that these are
commonly borrow'd from romances, and adapted occasionally by the poet to the
tenor of his allegory; and if it should be granted, that some, or the
greatest part of these were deriv'd from his own fancy, yet these, as
they so enormously transgress the bounds of nature and probability,
ought by no means to be ad∣mitted as genuine marks of the TRUE POET.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. VII. Of Spenser's Inaccuracies.</HEAD>
<P>FEW poets will appear to have written with greater rapidity than
Spenser. Hurried on by the vehe∣mence of imagination he frequently cannot
find time to attend to the niceties of construction, or to stand still
and revise what he has before written, in order to prevent contradiction,
inconsistency, or repetition. Hence it is, that he not only fails in the
connection of single words, but of circumstances, and not only violates the
rules of grammar, but those of truth, probability and propriety. He was more
sollicitous about giving bold than exact touches to his figures, and was so
earnestly intent of forming what was great, that he forgot to produce that
which was correct. So that if, with these inaccuracies, we consider the
irregu∣larity of Spenser's plan in general, we may venture to conclude, that
no poet ever shewed more imagi∣gination with less judgement, than the
author of the FAERIE QUEENE. It may be looked upon as a very officious piece of
ill-nature to draw together these in∣ferior and subordinate faults, and 
<Q> 
<L>—Seek slight faults to find,</L> 
<L>Where nature moves, and rapture warms the mind.</L></Q></P>
<P>But a review of them will tend to explain many pas∣sages in
particular in our author, and to bring us ac∣quainted with his manner in
general.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="163"/>I shall begin with his Elleipses, in
which the rea∣der will find his omission of the Relative to be fre∣quent.

<P>In these lines, 
<Q> 
<L>Was underneath enveloped with gold,</L> 
<L>Whose glistring gloss DARKNED with filthy
dust.</L> 
<BIBL>2. 8. 4.</BIBL></Q> says Mr. Jortin, DARKNED is put
for <HI>was darkned</HI>; and among other instances of Spenser's
elleipses, produces the following, in the Tears of the Muses. 
<Q> 
<L>And all the sisters <HI>rent</HI> their golden
hairs,</L> 
<L>And their fair faces with salt humour
<HI>steepe.</HI></L></Q> <HI>steep</HI> for <HI>did</HI> steep.—Of
this sort there is an elleipsis in these lines of Milton's EPITAPH ON THE
MARCHIONESS OF WINCHESTER. 
<Q> 
<L>Her high birth, and graces sweet,</L> 
<L>Quickly <HI>found</HI> a lover meet;</L> 
<L>The virgin-quire for her <HI>request</HI></L> 
<L>The God that sits at marriage-feast.</L></Q> The poet
when he wrote <HI>request</HI> had forgot that his former preter-imperfect
tense, <HI>found,</HI> was form'd without the sign <HI>did.</HI> It may not
be impertinent to remark, that the Marchioness lamented in this Epitaph of
Milton, is probably the same with that celebrated by B. Johnson, in an
<HI>Elegie on the Lady</HI> ANNE PAWLETT, <HI>Marchio∣ness of</HI> WINTON;
the Beginning of which Pope seems to have thought of, when he wrote his
<HI>Verses to the Memory of an Unfortunate</HI> LADY. Johnson begins his
Elegie, 
<Q> 
<L>What gentle ghost, besprent with April dew</L> 
<L>Hayles me so solemnly to yonder yew?</L> 
<L>And beck'ning wooes me, &amp;c.</L> 
<BIBL>In the Underwood.</BIBL></Q> In which strain Mr. Pope
beautifully breaks out, 
<Q> 
<L>What beck'ning ghost along the moonlight shade,</L> 
<L>Invites my steps, and points to yonder glade?</L> 
<L>'Tis she—</L> 
<BIBL>Warb. edit. vol. 1.</BIBL></Q></P> 
<P>As Johnson now lies before me, I may perhaps be pardon'd for
pointing out another passage in him, which Mr. Pope probably re∣member'd
when he wrote the following. 
<Q> 
<L>From shelves to shelves see greedy Vulcan roll,</L> 
<L>And lick up all their physic of the soul.</L> 
<BIBL>Dunciad. B. 3. v. 81.</BIBL></Q> Thus Johnson,
speaking of a parcel of books, 
<Q> 
<L>These, hadst thou pleas'd either to dine or sup,</L>

<L>Had made a meale, for VULCAN TO LICK UP.</L> 
<BIBL>An execration upon Vulcane. In the
Underwood.</BIBL></Q></P></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="169"/>I shall now produce some instances of
his con∣fused construction. 
<Q> 
<BIBL>B. i. C. iii. S. xii.</BIBL> 
<L>Till seeing by her side the Lyon stand</L> 
<L>With sudden fearee her pitcher downe she threw,</L> 
<L>And fled away; for never in that land</L> 
<L><PB N="167" REF="170"/>Face of faire lady did she ever
view,</L> 
<L>And that dread Lyons looke her cast in deadly hew.</L></Q></P>
<P>After having told us, that seeing the Lyon stand by her, she
fled away for fear, he adds, that this was because he never had seen a lady
before, which cer∣tainly was no reason why she should fly from the lyon.
What our author intended to express here, was, that 
<Q REND="inline">"at seeing the lyon, and so beautiful a lady,
an object never seen before in that country, she was affrighted, and
fled."</Q> 
<Q><BIBL>B. i. C. vi. S. v.</BIBL> 
<L>—He gan the fort assaile,</L> 
<L>Whereof he weend possessed soone to bee,</L> 
<L>And with rich spoile of ransackt chastitie.</L></Q>
<HI>Of which he weend soone to bee possessed,</HI> is not improper;
but, to be possessed <HI>with rich spoile,</HI> &amp;c. is very
inac∣curate. Here seems to be likewise somewhat of an elleipsis, and I
think he should have said, <HI>rich spoile of</HI> ITS <HI>ransackt
chastitie.</HI> 
<Q> 
<BIBL>B. i. C. x. S. xl.</BIBL> 
<L>The fourth appointed by his office was</L> 
<L>Poor prisoners to relieve with gracious ayde,</L> 
<L>And captives to redeeme with price of brass,</L> 
<L>From Turks and Sarazins which them had staid;</L> 
<L>And though they faultie were, yet well he waid</L> 
<L>That God to us forgiveth everie howre,</L> 
<L>Much more than that why they in bands were layd.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="171"/>The poet says, that his office was to
relieve PRI∣SONERS, and to redeem CAPTIVES with money from Turkish slavery;
who though guilty of crimes, yet he consider'd that God every hour pardons
crimes much greater than those for which they were impri∣son'd.—By
this it should seem, that those enslav'd by the Turks were guilty of
crimes, &amp;c. but the poet would signify by <HI>they faultie were,</HI> the
prisoners first mention'd, who were deservedly imprison'd on account of
their crimes.</P>
<P>Another instance of our author's inaccuracy, is, his tautology,
or repetition of the same circumstances. 
<Q><BIBL>B. iv. C. xii. S. i.</BIBL> 
<L>For much more eath to tell the starres on hy,</L> 
<L>Albe they endlesse seeme, &amp;c.</L> 
<L>Then to recount the seas posteritie.</L></Q> The
difficulty of numbering the deities present at the marriage of Thames and
Medway, he expresses in the same manner, in the stanza immediately
preceding. 
<Q> 
<L>The which more eath it were for mortall wight,</L> 
<L>To tell the sands, or count the starres on hye.</L></Q> 
<Q> 
<BIBL>B. vi. C. vi. S. iv.</BIBL> 
<L>For whylome he had been a doughty knight,</L> 
<L>As any one that lived in his dayes,</L> 
<L>And proved oft in many a perilous fight,</L> 
<L><PB N="169" REF="172"/>In which he grace and glory won
alwaies;</L> 
<L>And in all battles bore away the bayes;</L> 
<L>But being now attackt with timely age</L> 
<L>And wearie of this world's unquiet waies,</L> 
<L>He tooke himselfe unto this hermitage.</L></Q> All this we
were told a few lines before. 
<Q> 
<L>And soothly it was said by common fame,</L> 
<L>So long as age enabled him thereto,</L> 
<L>That he had been a man of mickle name,</L> 
<L>Renouned much in arms, and derring doe;</L> 
<L>But being aged now, and weary too</L> 
<L>Of warres delights, and worlds contentious toyle,</L> 
<L>The name of knighthood he did disavow,</L> 
<L>And hanging up his arms, and warlike spoile,</L> 
<L>From all the worlds incumbrance did himself assoile.</L>

<BIBL>C. v. S. 37.</BIBL></Q> To this head we may refer the
redundancies of a word. 
<Q><BIBL>B. iii. C. vi. S. xi.</BIBL> 
<LG>
<L>It fortuned faire Venus having lost</L>
<L>Her little son, the winged god of love,</L>

<LG N="12">
<HEAD><BIBL>xii.</BIBL></HEAD>
<L>Him for to seeke SHE left her heavenly house.</L>
</LG></Q> <PB N="170" REF="173"/> SHE is unnecessary in the
last line, as FAIRE VENUS is the nominative case. Other instances of this
fault might be produced.</P>
<P>I shall now cite some instances in which he contra∣dicts
himself, and runs into other absurdities, on ac∣count of his forgetting, or
not reviewing what he had before written, and, in general, from an hasty
manner of composition. 
<Q><BIBL>B. i. C. iv. S. viii.</BIBL></Q>Speaking of Pride, he
says, she 
<Q> 
<L>—shone as Titan's ray.</L></Q> And in the following
stanza he compares her to Phae∣ton, where he says, she 
<Q> 
<L>Exceeding shone, like Phoebus fairest child.</L> 
<BIBL>S. 9.</BIBL></Q> This is a very striking Anti-climax. 
<Q> 
<BIBL>B. i. C. xi. S. xlvii.</BIBL> 
<L>Another faire like tree eke grew thereby,</L> 
<L>Whereof whoso did eat, eftsoones did know</L> 
<L>Both good and evil: O mournefull memory,</L> 
<L>That tree thro' one man's fault has done us all to
die.</L></Q> Here he tells us, that the tree of knowledge occa∣casion'd the
fall of man; in the stanza before, he af∣firms the same of the tree of
life.</P>
<Q><PB N="171" REF="174"/> 
<L>The tree of life the crime of our first father's fall.</L> 
<BIBL>S. 46.</BIBL></Q>
<Q><BIBL>B. ii. C. i. S. xxvi, xxvii.</BIBL></Q>
<P>In these stanzas Sir Guyon suddenly <HI>abases</HI> his
spear, and begs pardon of the red-crosse knight, for having attack'd him;
as if he had just now discover'd him to be the red-crosse knight:
whereas he knew him to be so, St. 19. and after that resolves to fight with
him. 
<Q><BIBL>B. iv. C. v. S. xxxvii.</BIBL></Q>Speaking of CARE, 
<Q> 
<L>He like a monstrous giant seemd in sight,</L> 
<L>Far passing Brontes, and Pyracmon great.</L></Q></P>
<P>If CARE was so monstrous a giant, how could he dwell, with his
six servants, in the little cottage above-mention'd? 
<Q> 
<L>They spide a little cottage, like some poore man's
nest.</L> 
<BIBL>S. 32.</BIBL></Q> 
<Q><BIBL>B. iv. C. i. S. liv.</BIBL> 
<L>The aged dame him seeing so enraged,</L> 
<L>Was dead with feare, &amp;c.</L></Q> </P>
<P>The aged dame Glauce might have easily pacified Sir Scudamore,
in this place, by telling him, that Bri∣tomartis was a woman; and as she was
so much ter∣rified, it was highly natural, that she should assure him
<PB N="172" REF="175"/> of it; tho' this would have prevented an entertaining
surprise, which the poet reserv'd for. 4. 6. 28. 
<Q><BIBL>B. i. C. ix. S. vi.</BIBL> 
<L>Aread, prince Arthur—</L></Q> </P>
<P>Arthur and Una have been hitherto represented as entire
strangers to each other; and it does not appear how Una became acquainted
with the name of this new knight.</P>
<Q><BIBL>B. i. C. viii. S. xliii, &amp;c.</BIBL></Q>
<P>It is unnatural, that the red-crosse knight should be so
suddenly reconcil'd to Una, after he had forsaken her for her supposed
infidelity and impurity. The poet should certainly have express'd an
eclaircisse∣ment between them.</P>
<Q><BIBL>B. vi. C. xi. S. li.</BIBL> </Q>
<P>It was an instance of Sir Calidore's courage, to re∣store to
Coridon his flocks; but not of his courtesie, to carry away his love
Pastorella. The poet should have manag'd the character of his PATRON OF
COUR∣TESIE with more art.</P>
<P>As Spenser has drawn the character of his hero prince Arthur
from history, he has limited himself to a particular period of time, in
which all the events of his poem, however fictitious or imaginary, are
sup∣posed to have happen'd: upon this account all disco∣veries made
since that particular period of time, are <PB N="173" REF="176"/> improperly
specified; and the mention of them may be justly term'd an anachronism.
Our author has been guilty of one or two faults of this kind, which we shall
lay before the reader. 
<Q> 
<L>And evermore their hideous ordinance,</L> 
<L>Upon the bulwarkes cruelly did play.</L> 
<BIBL>2. 11. 14.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>Spenser should have spar'd this circumstance of fire-arms.
Ariosto was more cautious in this matter; for tho' he has suppos'd the
use of them upon a par∣ticular occasion in the age of Charlemagne; yet,
not∣withstanding, he hints, that they were soon after∣wards destroy'd,
and that the use of them was not re∣viv'd till many years after; and as the
invention, so the revival of them is attributed to the devil. C. 11. S. 22.
It has been observ'd, that Milton copied the invention of fire-arms from
Ariosto; and it may fur∣ther be observ'd, that Milton, in the speech
which one of the evil angels makes upon them, 
<Q> 
<L>—They shall fear we have disarm'd</L> 
<L>The thunderer of his only dreaded bolt,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Par. L. 6. 490.</BIBL></NOTE></L></Q> has copied from
himself, in one of his latin epigrams.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"> 
<P>There are other strokes likewise in Milton's lesser
poems, which he has transferr'd into his GREAT WORK. Thus in SAMSON
Agonistes, 
<Q> 
<L>THRICE SHE ASSAY'D with flatt'ring pray'rs and
sighs,</L> 
<L>And amorous reproaches, to win from me</L> 
<L>My capital secret, &amp;c.</L> 
<L>THRICE I deluded her.—</L> 
<BIBL>v. 392.</BIBL></Q> This form he has exactly repeated in
PARADISE LOST. 
<Q> 
<L>THRICE HE ASSAY'D, and THRICE, in spite of scorn,</L> 
<L>Tears, such as angels weep, burst forth.—</L> 
<BIBL>1. 619.</BIBL></Q> In COMUS, 
<Q> 
<L>—A perpetual feast of nectar'd sweets</L> 
<L>Where no CRUDE SURFEIT REIGNS.</L></Q> In PARADISE LOST, 
<Q> 
<L>Quaff immortality and joy, SECURE</L> 
<L>OF SURFEIT.—</L> 
<BIBL>5. 638.</BIBL></Q> In COMUS, 
<Q> 
<L>A thousand LIVERIED ANGELS LACKEY her.</L></Q> The
following, in PARADISE LOST, is a kindred image, 
<Q> 
<L>About her as a GUARD ANGELIC plac'd.</L> 
<BIBL>8. 559.</BIBL></Q> Among Milton's IMITATIONS OF
HIMSELF, I think the following have been unobserved. In Il PENSEROSO, 
<Q> 
<L>Sometimes let gorgeous TRAGEDY</L> 
<L>In scepter'd pall come sweeping by,</L> 
<L>Presenting THEBES, or PELOPS' line,</L> 
<L>Or the Tale of TROY divine.</L></Q> It appears, that the
Greek Tragedies, founded upon these stories made an early, and
consequently a lasting impression upon Milton. In his first elegy to
Diodatus, written before he was arriv'd at his twentieth year, he
particularises them, where (as in the lines just cited) he is speaking of
tragedy in general. 
<Q> 
<L><HI>Seu maeret</HI> PELOPEA DOMUS, <HI>sen nobilis</HI>
ILI,</L> 
<L><HI>Seu luit incestos aula</HI> CREONTIS

<BIBL>B. 1. El. 1.</BIBL></Q> In L' ALLEGRO,

<P>It has been before remark'd, that Milton takes all
opportunities of illustrating the power of music, and of expressing his
extreme fond∣ness for it: These verses, in COMUS, relating to that
subject, 
<Q> 
<L>—SYLLA wept,</L> 
<L>And chid her BARKING waves into ATTENTION,</L> 
<L>And FELL CHARYBDIS murmurd hoarse applause,</L></Q>
strongly resemble what Silius Italicus describes of a Sicilian Shep∣herd
playing on his reed, 
<Q> 
<L><HI>Scyllaei tacuere canes, stetit atra
charybdis.</HI></L> 
<BIBL>14. 476.</BIBL></Q> But shall we suspect Milton
of plagiarism because the Roman poet wrote FIRST? was it not NATURAL for
either poet in expressing the force of music in the ISLE OF SICILY, to
mention it's influence on two most implacable objects, which the SITUATION of
the Musi∣cian, in both cases, suggested?</P> 
<P>The fable of the garden of the Hesperides seems to have
affected the imagination of Milton in a very particular manner, as his
allu∣sions to it are most remarkably frequent, viz. 
<Q> 
<L>And LADIES of th' HESPERIDES—</L> 
<BIBL>PAR. REG. 2. 357.</BIBL></Q>

<L>HESPERIAN.</L> 
<BIBL>ibid. 8. 631.</BIBL></Q> And in the original draught of
the Spirit's prologue to COMUS, he has painted these delicious islands with
the utmost luxuriancy of fancy. In LYCIDAS, 
<Q> 
<L>WEEP NO MORE, wofull shepherds, WEEP NO MORE,</L> 
<L>For Lycidas your sorrow is not dead,</L>

<P>I shall conclude this tedious note with observing, that
Milton's genius for describing DIVINE things, which shines with so
distin∣guished a lustre in the PARADISE LOST, discover'd itself in
some of his most early productions. In the juvenile poems we meet with
frequent descriptions of the bliss and splendor of heaven, of the glory
of celestial beings, of angelic music, and of other objects placed 
<Q> 
<L>Beyond the visible diurnal sphere.</L></Q> of this, a
passage cited above, as is the ode on the NATIVITY, on the CIRCUMCISION, at
a SOLEMN MUSIC, &amp;c. &amp;c. are testimonies. Even at the age of
seventeen, we find that a disposition to conceive images of this sort
began to dawn in his imagination,

<HEAD>SECT. VIII. Of Spenser's imitations of himself.</HEAD>
<P>COmmentators of less taste than learning, of less judgment
than ostentation, have taken infinite pains to point out those passages
which their respective authors have imitated from others.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The curious reader is more particularly referr'd to that
exten∣sive and elaborate series of quotation, entitled, 
<Q REND="inline">"VIRGILIUS COL∣LATIONE SCRIPTORUM GRAECORUM
ILLUSTRATUS OPERA &amp; IN∣DUSTRIA FULVII URSINI.</Q></NOTE> This enquiry is
executed with a modest reserve, and extended no far∣ther than to those
passages which are distinguish'd with more indubitable evidences of
transcription or imitation, might (it should seem) prove equally
instructive and entertaining: as it would the better enable us to regu∣late
our idea of the merit and character of an author, by ascertaining what degree
of genuine invention is to be allow'd him, and by shewing how far he has
im∣prov'd the materials of another by his own art and man∣ner of application;
at the same time that it must ne∣cessarily gratify the inquisitive
disposition of every reader. But where there are even the most apparent
traces of likeness, how very seldom can it be affirm'd, with any truth, as
a late very sagacious critic 
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See, A DISCOURSE on POETICAL
IMITATION.</NOTE> has amply prov'd, that an imitation was intended? and how few
of the commentators above-mention'd are there, who do not (to use his own
words) mistake RESEM∣BLANCES <PB N="181" REF="184"/> for THEFTS?<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is true, in general, that parallellists mistake
resemblances for thefts; but this assertion by no means affects the
instances which I have given, in two former sections, of Spenser's
imitations from Chaucer and Ariosto. Spenser is universally acknowledg'd
to have been an attentive reader, and profess'd admirer of both those
poets; his imitations from the former are most commonly LITERAL; and what he
has copied from the latter, are ARTIFICIAL FICTIONS, which consisting of
UNNATURAL COMBINATIONS, could not, on account of their SINGULARITY, be fallen
upon by both poets <HI>accidentally</HI>; as NATURAL APPEARANCES might be,
which lie <HI>expos'd</HI> and <HI>obvious</HI> to all, at all times: so that
we may safely pro∣nounce the resemblances produc'd in the sections
above-mention'd, to have been INTENDED.</NOTE> As this then is a business
which proceeds upon an uncertain foundation, afford∣ing the amusement of
conjecture rather than the satis∣faction of truth; it may perhaps be a more
serviceable undertaking, to produce an author's IMITATIONS OF HIMSELF: and
this will be more particularly useful in the three following respects, viz.
It will discover the FAVORITE IMAGES of an author; it will teach us how
VARIOUSLY he expresses the same thought; and it will often EXPLAIN
DIFFICULT passages, and words.

</LG></Q></P>
<P>It is a trite observation, that we paint that best, which we
have felt most. Spenser's whole life seems to have consisted of
disappointments and distress; so that he, probably, was not
unacquainted with the bitter agonies of a despairing mind, which the warmth
of his imagina∣tion, and, what was its consequence, his sensibility of
temper contributed to render doubly severe. Unmerit∣ed and unpitied indigence
ever struggles hardest with <PB N="194" REF="197"/> true genius; and a good
taste, for the same reasons that it enhances the pleasures of life,
sustains with uncom∣mon torture the miseries of that state, 
<Q REND="inline">"in which (says an incomparable moralist)
every virtue is obscured, and in which no conduct can avoid reproach; a
state in which chearfulness is insensibility, and dejection
fullenness, of which the hardships are without ho∣nour, and the labours
without reward."</Q> To these may be added his personage FEAR. 
<Q> 
<L>Next him was FEAR all arm'd from top to toe,</L> 
<L>Yet thought himselfe not safe enough thereby;</L> 
<L>But fear'd each shadow moving to and fro;</L> 
<L>And his owne armes when glittering he did spy,</L> 
<L>Or clashing heard, he fast away did fly,</L> 
<L>As ashes pale of hew, and wingy-heel'd;</L> 
<L>And evermore on Danger fix'd his eye,</L> 
<L>'Gainst whom he alwaies bent a brazen shield,</L>

<Q>

<L>But senselesse stood, like to amazed steare</L>

<L>Like one adawed with some dreadfull spright.</L> 
<BIBL>5. 7. 20.</BIBL></Q> </P>
<P>Other instances of this sort might be cited; but these are
the most striking.</P>
<P>It is proper to remark, in this place, that Spenser has given
three large descriptions, much of the same nature, viz. The Bower of
Bliss, 2. 12. The Gardens of Adonis, 3. 5. And the Gardens of the Temple of
Venus, 4. 10. all which, though, in general, the same, his invention has
diversified with many new circumstances; as it has likewise his Mornings:
and perhaps we meet with no poet who has more re∣quently, or more minutely, at
the same time, de∣lineated the Morning, than Spenser. He has intro∣duced
two historical genealogies of future kings and princes of England, 3. 3. and,
2. 10. beside two or three other shorter sketches of English history.
He often repeatedly introduces his allegorical figures, which he sometimes
describes with very little variation from his first representation;
particularly, DISDAIN, FEAR, ENVY, and DANGER. In this poem we like∣wise meet
with two hells, 1. 5. 31. and 2. 7. 21.</P>
<P>It may not be foreign to the purpose of this Section, to lay
before the reader some uncommon words and expressions, of which
Spenser, by his frequent use, seems particularly fond. 
<Q><BIBL>B. ii. C. v. S. xxxii.</BIBL> 
<L>That round about him dissolute did PLAY</L> 
<L>Their wanton follies, and light merriment.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="199"/>Spenser often uses the verb PLAY, in
this sense, with an accusative case. 
<Q> 
<L>A multitude of babes about her hong,</L> 
<L>PLAYING their sports.—</L> 
<BIBL>1. 10. 31.</BIBL></Q>

<Q> 
<L>—did SPORT</L> 
<L>Their spotlesse pleasure, and sweet love's

<P><PB N="197" REF="200"/>Spenser often arbitrarily prefixes MIS to

Spenser frequently uses GRIDE, which signifies to <HI>pierce.</HI> This
word, as E. K. remarks in the Pastoral of Fe∣bruarie, is often used by
Lidgate, but never once by Chaucer. Spenser was very well versed in all our
an∣tient English bards, but I do not remember that he pays a compliment to
any of them, Chaucer excepted<NOTE N="(*)" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Passim.</BIBL></NOTE>, and the 
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Epilogue to the

<HEAD>SECT. IX. Mr. Upton's opinion, concerning several
passages in Spenser, examined.</HEAD>
<P>AS that part of criticism which consists in rectify∣ing the
doubtful readings, and explaining the more obscure passages of an antient
author, necessarily <PB N="206" REF="209"/> deals much in conjecture, and
from its nature can sel∣dom afford demonstration, and as those who are
em∣ploy'd in this province, are too frequently compell'd to deduce their
positions, not from what is, but from that which seems to be the truth, no
science, perhaps, pro∣duces a greater diversity of opinions concerning the
same point, than this. That which appears a lucky cor∣rection or alteration
to one commentator, is rejected by another, as absolutely improbable and
absurd; and, indeed, the difference of sentiment in this case, is
dictated by the different manner of conceiving things, which nature has
implanted in the minds of different persons. At the same time it must be
acknowledg'd, that the pride of appearing more sagacious than our
predecessors, often occasions the variation here insisted upon; and
sometimes mere caprice and obstinacy. Though in examining some of the
ensuing passages, I may be deceiv'd (as the rest of my brethren have
been) by the appearance of truth, which I have as∣sign'd above, as one of
the causes of difference of opi∣nion among the critics; I can promise the
reader, that I will not suffer myself to be voluntarily misled by any of
the last-mention'd corrupt principles and pre∣judices; and, upon this
account, I shall be ready to give up any point, which, in this Section, I
shall be proved to have mistaken; hoping to find Mr. Upton a no less
candid man, than an ingenious critic.</P>

<Q><BIBL>B. i. C. i. S. xliii.</BIBL> 
<L>A fit false dream that can delude the sleepers
SENT.</L></Q> Mr. Upton proposes to read sleepers SHENT, i. e. sleepers
ill-treated or abus'd. But I rather think, that we should preserve the
common reading, SENT, which is the proper and original spelling of
<HI>scent: Sent,</HI> says Skinner (which we falsely write
<HI>scent</HI>) is deriv'd <HI>a sentiendo.</HI> Thus the meaning of this
verse, is, 
<Q REND="inline">"A false dream that could deceive or impose
upon the sleeper's perception."</Q> So that <HI>sent,</HI> if we consider
its <HI>radix, sentio,</HI> is here plainly made to sig∣nify perception in
general. <HI>Scent</HI> is often thus spelt in our author.

anatomical disquisition concern∣ing the possibility of living after

fell down <HI>alive,</HI> and did not die till after his fall, in these
lines, 
<Q> 
<L>—His grudging ghost did strive</L> 
<L>With the fraile flesh; at last it flitted is.</L></Q> Mr.
Upton would enforce and confirm the justness of his correction, by
remarking, that the poet, in these verses, copied from Virgil, 
<Q> 
<L><HI>Procubuit</HI> MORIENS, <HI>&amp;</HI> HUMUM <HI>semel
ore</HI> MOMORDIT.</L></Q> <PB N="209" REF="212"/> Where the word
<HI>moriens</HI> doth not imply, that the man who fell down, was dead. I must
confess that <HI>alive</HI> is superfluous, but Spenser has run into many
other superfluities on account of the frequency of his rhyme. Mr. Upton
proposes likewise to write Earth [<HI>His Mother Earth</HI>] with an
initial capital, supposing it a PERSON; however, we had, perhaps, better
suppose it a THING: for if we understand it to be a Person, what an
absurd mixture arises? 
<Q> 
<L>—His Mother EARTH did kiss,</L> 
<L>Greeting his GRAVE.—</L></Q> Grave cannot be referr'd to
Earth as a Person, but it may be to Earth as a Thing. However, it must be
confess'd, that this is such an absurd mixture as Spen∣ser was very
likely to have fallen into; and we have numberless instances of this fault,
in his account of the rivers which attended the marriage of Thames and Medway,
4. 11. Where God and River (that is, Person and Thing) are often
indiscriminately put, the one for the other. 
<Q><BIBL>B. xxiii. C. iv. S. i.</BIBL> 
<L>And a DRY DROPSIE through his flesh did flow.</L></Q> How
can a Dropsy <HI>flow,</HI> (says Mr. Upton) if it be <HI>dry?</HI> He
proposes to remove this contradiction by reading <HI>dire</HI> Dropsy, the
<HI>dirus Hydrops</HI> of Horace. But it is plain, that <HI>dry Dropsie</HI>
is the species of the Dropsy so call'd, the <HI>dry Dropsy</HI> or
<HI>Tympanites</HI>; which Spenser has inaccurately confounded with the other
species of the Dropsy, which may not improperly be <PB N="210" REF="213"/>
said to <HI>flow through the flesh</HI>; not considering the
in∣consistency of making a <HI>dry</HI> thing <HI>flow.</HI> As to Mr.
Upton's correction <HI>dire,</HI> I cannot perceive how DIRE could ever be
mistaken by the printers for DRY. Mr. Upton might, with equal propriety, have
objected to the following words, DRY <HI>Drops.</HI> 
<Q> 
<L>And with DRY DROPS congealed in her eye.</L> 
<BIBL>2. 1. 49.</BIBL></Q> By the way, it will be difficult
also to determine what Spenser means by <HI>congealed,</HI> which occurs
again in the same sense, and on the same occasion, 
<Q> 
<L>—In whose faire eye</L> 
<L>The crystal humour stood congealed round.</L> 
<BIBL>3. 5. 29.</BIBL></Q> But, upon supposition that the
tears were actually frozen in her eye, we should think <HI>dry</HI> a very
odd epithet for ice.</P>
<P>To return: By DRY <HI>Dropsie,</HI> may not the poet, also
mean, a <HI>Dropsie,</HI> which is <HI>the</HI> CAUSE <HI>of thirst?</HI> 
<Q><BIBL>B. i. C. iv. S. xlii.</BIBL> 
<L>Him little answer'd th' angry Elfin knight.</L></Q> Mr.
Upton reads, 
<Q> 
<L>Him angry—</L></Q> Him angry, says Mr. Upton, means
the Paynim, who is said to be <HI>enraged</HI> above, 
<Q> 
<L>Pardon the error of <HI>enraged</HI> wight.</L> 
<BIBL>S. 41.</BIBL></Q> But because the Paynim is angry, doth
it necessarily follow, that the Elfin knight should not be so too? He
certainly has reason to be enraged and angry after <PB N="211" REF="214"/>
that bitter taunt, which provokes him to throw down his gauntlet, as a
challenge. It is surely wrong to alter the text, when there is neither
necessity to re∣quire, nor authority to support the correction.

Mr. Upton thus reads the last line, 
<Q> 
<L>Both those AND TH' lawrel garlands to the victor
due.</L></Q> But surely Duessa, and Sans foy his shield, are the
lau∣rel garlands, that is, the rewards to be given to the conqueror. Laurel
garlands are metaphorically used, and put in apposition with Duessa,
and Sans foy his shield. It may be urg'd, as another objection to Mr. Upton's
alteration, that Spenser never cuts off the vowel in THE before a
consonant; upon which ac∣count I would reject Hughes's reading of the
follow∣ing line, 
<Q> 
<L>The Nemaean forest 'till th' Amphitryonide—</L> 
<BIBL>7. 7. 36.</BIBL></Q> That editor reads, 
<Q> 
<L>TH' Nemaean—</L></Q> Hughes's reading, indeed,
restores the true accent to Nemaean, but Spenser frequently violates the
accent of names of ancient places, &amp;c.

that we refer <HI>aye burn∣ing</HI> to <HI>Fier-brond,</HI> does not approve of
reading <HI>aye-burning,</HI> but <HI>y-burning.</HI> He is unwilling to join
<HI>ay-</HI> (or <HI>y) burning</HI> to <HI>Stygian Lake</HI>; for, says he,
the lake of brimstone burnt not <HI>bright,</HI> but only serv'd to make
darkness visible. I allow, that Milton's idea of this lake was, that it
serv'd to make <HI>darkness visible.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Par. Lost, 1. v. 63.</BIBL></NOTE> But might not
Spenser's idea of the Stygian lake be different from Milton's? Besides, why
was the wea∣pon carried to this Lake to be <HI>kindled,</HI> unless the Lake
was BURNING?</P>
<P>The poet has given us the same image and allego∣ry in another

ΠΟΙΕΙΝ, <HI>versus facere.</HI> But there is reason

into fashion about the age of Q. Elizabeth.

inclin'd to believe, that our author drew this circumstance from books that
he was probably much better acquainted with, old romances. In MORTE ARTHUR we
have frequent in∣stances of knights swearing in this manner. The same
ceremony occurs again, 
<Q> 
<L>—He made him sweare</L>

that Milton has likewise us'd <PB N="216" REF="219"/> the same Latin
metaphor; I suppose the passage hin∣ted at by Mr. Upton is, where,
Satan

therefore, that Spenser here intended no metaphor, but that he us'd SHERE for

<HEAD>SECT. X. Of Spenser's Allegorical Character.</HEAD>
<P>IN reading the works of an author who lived in a remote age, it is
necessary, that we should look back upon the customs and manners which
prevailed in his age; that we should place ourselves in his si∣tuation,
and circumstances; that so we may be the bet∣ter enabled to judge and
discern how his turn of thinking, and manner of composing were biass'd,
in∣fluenc'd, and, as it were, tinctur'd, by very familiar and reigning
appearances, which are utterly different from those with which we are at
present surrounded. For want of this caution, too many readers view the
knights and damsels, the turnaments and enchant∣ments of Spenser with
modern eyes, never consider∣ing that the encounters of Chivalry
subsisted in our author's age, as has been before hinted<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Sect. ii.</BIBL></NOTE>; that ro∣mances were
then most eagerly and universally read; and that thus, Spenser from the
fashion of his age, was naturally dispos'd to undertake a recital of
chivalrous atchievements, and to become, in short, a ROMANTIC POET.</P>
<P>Nor is it sufficiently consider'd, that a prevalent practice
of Spenser's age contributed in a very consi∣derable <PB N="218" REF="221"/>
degree to make him an ALLEGORICAL POET. It should be remember'd that, in the
age of which we are speaking, allegory was the subject and foun∣dation of
public shews and spectacles, which were then exhibited with a magnificence
superior to that of former times; that the vices and virtues personify'd,
and represented by living actors, distinguish'd with their respective
emblematical types, were generally in∣troduc'd to constitute PAGEANTRIES,
which were then the principal entertainments, and shewn not only in private,
and upon the stage, but very frequently in the open streets, for
solemnising any public occasion. As a proof of what is here advanc'd, I
would refer the reader to Hollinshed's 
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"> 
<Q REND="inline">"And to keep that shew companie, (but yet
farre off) stoode the SHEWE OF MANHOODE and DESART; as first to be
pre∣sented: and that shewe was as well furnished as the other: men all,

strive, (or should have contended;) but GOOD FORTUNE (as victor of all
conquests) was to come in and overthrow MANHOOD, &amp;c."

same author.</P> 
<P>It is not improbable, that Milton, in IL PENSEROSO, took his
thought of hearing music from the earth, produc'd by some SPIRIT or GENIUS,

<Q> 
<L>And as I wake, sweet music BREATH,</L> 
<L>Above, about, or UNDERNEATH.—</L></Q> From some
machinery of Inigo Jones, in his Masques. Hollinshed mentions something
like this, in a very curious DEVISE presented before Queen Elizabeth;
speaking of the music of some fictitious nymphs; he adds, 
<Q REND="inline">"which sure had been a noble hearing, and

<P><PB N="219" REF="222"/>In the mean time, I do not deny that our
author, was in great measure, induc'd, from the practice of Ariosto, to
write a poem partaking much of allegory: yet it must still be granted, that
Spenser's manner of allegorizing seems to have rather resulted from
some of the spectacles just mention'd, than from what he had red in
Ariosto. In fact, Ariosto's allegory does not so much consist in
personifying the virtues, vices, and affections of the mind, as it does in
adumbrat∣ing moral doctrine 
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is affirmed by Plutarch, that 
<Q REND="inline">"Allegory is that, in which one thing is related
and another understood."</Q> Thus Ariosto RELATES the adventures of
Orlando, Rogero, Bradamante, &amp;c. by which is UNDERSTOOD the conquest of
the passions, the excel∣lence of virtue, and other moral doctrines; on
which account we may term the ORLANDO a MORAL poem; but can we term the FAERIE
QUEEN upon the whole, a MORAL POEM? is it not e∣qually an HISTORICAL or
POLITICAL poem? for tho' it be (accord∣ing to its author's words) an ALLEGORY
or DARK CONCEIT, yet that which is couched or understood under this allegory
is the history, and intrigues of Queen Elizabeth's courtiers; which how∣ever
are introduc'd with a moral design.</NOTE> under the actions of men and 
<PB N="220" REF="223"/> women. In such an adumbration, Spenser's allegory
sometimes consists; as in the first book, where The Red-crosse
Knight, or a TRUE CHRISTIAN, attended by Una, or TRUTH, defeats the wiles of
Archimago, or the DEVIL, &amp;c. &amp;c. yet he has shewn himself a much
more ingenious allegorist, where his IMAGINA∣TION BODIES forth
unsubstantial things, TURNS THEM TO SHAPE, and marks out the nature,
powers, and effects of that which is ideal and abstracted, by visible and
external symbols; as in his delineations of FEAR, ENVY, FANCY, DESPAIR, and
the like. Ariosto gives us but few of these symbolical beings, in
comparison of Spenser; and those which he has given us, are by no means
drawn with that fullness and distinctness with which they are painted by
the latter. And that Spenser painted these figures so fully and
distinctly, may we not reasonably attribute it, to his being frequently
ha∣bituated to the sight of these symbolical beings, distin∣guish'd
with their proper emblems, and actually en∣dued with speech, motion, and
life?</P>
<P>As a more convincing argument in confirmation of what has been
asserted upon this head, it may be re∣mark'd, that Spenser denominates
his most exquisite groupe of allegorical figures, the MASKE OF CUPID; thus,
without recurring to conjecture, his own words indubitably demonstrate, that
he had sometimes repre∣sentations of this sort in his eye: he tells us,
that these figures were

<L>In MANNER of a MASKE enranged orderly.</L> 
<BIBL>3. 12. 5.</BIBL></Q> <PB N="221" REF="224"/> And in his
introduction to this groupe, it is manifest that he drew from another

<P>From what has been said, I would not have it ob∣jected, that I
have intended to arraign the natural fertility of our author's invention; and
to prove, that he minutely copied after these representations; all that I
have endeavoured to inculcate, is, that Spenser was not only better qualified
to delineate fictions of this sort, because they were 
<Q> 
<L>—OCULIS <HI>subjecta fidelibus</HI>—<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Hor. Art. Poet. 182.</BIBL></NOTE></L></Q> Because they
were the real objects of his sight, but that (as all men are influenced by
what they see) he was prompted and induced to delineate them, because he
saw them, especially as they were so much the de∣light of his age.</P>
<P>Instead of entering into an examination of Spenser's manner of
allegorising, and of the conduct of his allegories in particular, which has
been done with an equally judicious and ingenious discernment by Mr.
Spense;<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Polymet. B. 10. D. 4.</BIBL> To
Mr. Spense's examination it may be added, that our author frequently
introduces an allegory, under which no meaning is couch'd; viz. 2. 9. 21. ALMA
is the mind, and her CASTLE the body. The tongue is the porter of this
castle, the nose the Portcullis, and the mouth the porch, about the
inside of which are placed twice sixteen warders clad in white, which are
the teeth; these ALMA passes by, who rise up, and do obeysance to
her. St. 26. But how can the teeth be said to rise up and bow to the mind?
Spenser here forgot that he was allegorising, and speaks as if he was
describing (without any latent meaning) a real queen, with twice sixteen
real warders, who, as such, might, with no improprie∣ty, be said to rise
and bow to their queen. Many instances of his confounding allegory with
reality, occur through this whole Canto, and the two next; particularly, where
he is describing the kitchen of this castle, which is the belly, he gives
us a formal description of such a kitchen, as was to be seen in his time
in castles, and great houses, by no means expressive of the thing
intended. Again, the occult meaning of his bringing Scudamore to the house of
CARE, 4. 5. 32. clashes with what he had before told us. By this allego∣ry of
Scudamore coming to CARE's house, it should be UNDER∣STOOD, that 
<Q REND="inline">"Scudamore, from a happy, pass'd into a
miserable state."</Q> For we may reasonable suppose, that before he
came to CARE's house, he was unacquainted with CARE; whereas the poet had
before represented him as involv'd in extreme misery. It would be tedious,
by an allegation of particular examples, to de∣monstrate, how frequently his
allegories are mere descriptions; and that, taken in their literal sense,
they have an improper, or no sig∣nification, veil'd under them. I shall,
however, mention one. The BLATANT BEAST is said to break into the
monasteries, to rob their chancels, cast down the desks of the monks,
deface the altars, and destroy the images found in their churches. By the
BLATANT BEAST is understood Scandal, and by the havock just mentioned as
effected by it, is implied the suppression of religious houses and
popish superstition. But how can this be properly said to have been
brought about by scandal? and how could Spenser, in parti∣lar, say this,
who was, as it appears by his pastorals, a friend to the reformation, as was
his heroine Queen Elizabeth?</NOTE> I shall mention one capital fault
committed by the poet in this point, which does not immediately fall under the
rules of criticism.</P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="226"/> 
<Q REND="inline">"Painters, says a French writer, ought to employ
their allegories in religious pictures, with much greater reserve than in
profane pieces. They may, indeed, in such subjects as do not represent
the mysteries and miracles of our religion, make use of 
<PB N="224" REF="227"/> an allegorical composition, the action whereof shall
be expressive of some truth, that cannot be repre∣sented otherwise,
either in painting or sculpture. I agree therefore to let them draw FAITH and
HOPE supporting a dying person, and RELIGION in deep affliction at the feet
of a deceased prelate. But I am of opinion, that artists who treat of the
mira∣cles and dogmas of our religion, are allowed no kind of allegorical
composition.—The facts whereon our religion is built, and the doctrine
it delivers us, are subjects in which the painter's imagination has no
liberty to sport.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Abbe du Bos,
<HI>Reflexions,</HI> &amp;c. Tom. i. c. xxiv.</BIBL></NOTE>"</Q> The conduct
which this author condemns, is practised by Spenser, with this difference
only; that the painters here condemned are supposed to adapt human allegory
to divine mystery, whereas Spenser has adopted divine mystery to human
allegory. Such a practice as this, is not only to con∣found sacred and
profane matters, but to place the li∣centious sallies of imagination upon a
level with the dictates of divine inspiration; to debase the truth and
dignity of heavenly things, by making Christian alle∣gory subservient to
the purposes of Romantic fiction.</P>
<P>This fault our author has most glaringly committed throughout
his whole first book, where the imaginary instruments and expedients of
romance, are perpetually interwoven with the mysteries contained in the BOOK
of REVELATIONS. Duessa, who is formed upon the idea of a romantic
enchantress, is gorgeously array'd in gold and purple, and presented with
a

Orgoglio, and seated by him on a mon∣strous seven-headed dragon, (i. 7.
16.) whose tail reaches to the skies, and throws down the stars, (St.
18.) she bearing a golden cup in her hand. (1. 8. 25.) This is the SCARLET
WHORE, and the RED DRAGON in the REVELATIONS. 
<Q REND="inline">"Behold a great red dragon, having seven heads,
and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads; and his tail drew the third
part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to earth<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>C. 12. V. 3, 4.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q> Again, 
<Q REND="inline">"I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet-colour'd

<P>A hermit points out to the RED-CROSSE knight the New Jerusalem,
(1. 10. 53.) which an angel discovers to St. John, (c. 21. 10, &amp;c.) This
prospect is taken, says the poet, from a mountain more lofty then either
the mount of Olives or Parnassus; these two compa∣risons thus
impertinently linked together, strongly re∣mind us of the absurdity we are
now speaking of, the mixture of divine truth, with profane invention; and
naturally lead us to reflect on the difference be∣tween the oracles frequently
utter'd from the former, and the fictions of those who dreamt on the
latter.</P>
<P>Spenser in the visionary dominions of Una's father has planted
the TREE of LIFE, and KNOWLEDGE: from the first of the trees, he says, a
well flow'd, whose waters contain'd a most salutary virtue, and which the
dragon could not approach. Thus in the same scripture, 
<Q REND="inline">"He shewed me a pure river of water of life,
clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God, and of the lamb. In
the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the river was there
the TREE of LIFE<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>C. 22. V. 1,
2.</BIBL></NOTE>".</Q> The circumstance, in par∣ticular, of the dragon not
being able to approach this water is literally adopted from Romance, as has
been before observ'd<NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Sect. ii.</BIBL></NOTE>.
Thus also by the steps and expe∣dients <PB N="227" REF="230"/> of romance,
we are led to the death of the dra∣gon who besieged the parents of Una, by
which is figur'd the destruction of the old serpent mention'd in the
Apocalypse.</P>
<P>The extravagancies of Pagan Mythology are not improperly
introduced into a poem of this sort, as they are acknowledged falsities, or
at best, if expres∣sive of any moral truth, no more than the inventions
of men. But he that applies the VISIONS OF GOD in such a manner, is guilty of
an impropriety, which, I fear, amounts to an impiety.</P>
<P>If we look back from Spenser's age thro' the state of poesy
in this kingdom, we shall find that it prin∣cipally consisted in the
allegoric species; but that this species never received its absolute
consummation till it appear'd with new lustre in the FAERIE QUEENE. There
are indeed the works of some English poets now remaining, who wrote before
Gower and Chau∣cer; but these are chiefly chroniclers in rhyme, and seem to
have left us the last dregs of that kind of composition which was practic'd
by the British bards: as for instance, the 
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That laborious Antiquary Thomas Hearne,

Gower and Chaucer were reputed the first Eng∣lish poets, because they
first introduc'd INVENTION into our poetry; they MORALIZED THEIR SONG, and
strove to render virtue more amiable, by cloathing her in the veil of
fiction. Chaucer, it must be ac∣knowledged, deserves to be rank'd as one of
the first English poets, on another account; his admirable ar∣tifice in
painting the manners, which none before him had ever attempted even in the
most imperfect de∣gree; and it should be remember'd to his honour, that he
was the first who gave the English nation, in its own language, an idea of
HUMOUR. With these flou∣rish'd the author of PIERCE PLOWMAN'S VISIONS, of
which I have given an occasional sketch, above. To these succeeded
Lydgate, who from his principal performances the FALL OF PRINCES, and STORY of

MACHABREE,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"> 
<P>One Machabree, a French poet, wrote a description, in
verse, of a procession painted on the walls of St. Innocent's cloister
at Pa∣ris, called the DANCE OF DEATH. This piece was translated by Lydgate,
who tells us in the Prologue, St. 5. 
<Q>

at Paris; the metres or poesie of this Daunce were translated out of French
into English by John Lidgate, Monk of Bury, and with the picture of Death
leading all estates, painted round the cloyster."</Q> pag. 264. This
picture is a wood∣cut, and prefixed to the poem we are speaking of, in
Tottell's edi∣tion of Lydgate, 1555; and is, I suppose, an exact
representation of what was painted in St. Paul's cloisters. It was
afterwards en∣graved by Hollar, in Dugdale's Monast. vol, 3. p. 368. In all
probability, this painting at St. Paul's, or that (which was the same) at St.
Innocent's, gave Hans Holbein the hint for composing his famous piece, call'd
the DANCE OF DEATH, now to be seen in the town-house at Basil.</P> 
<P>It is commonly supposed, that the wood-cuts, from whence
Hol∣lar engraved his exquisite sett of prints, entitled the DANCE OF DEATH,
were executed by Holbein: but I am apt to think this a mistake, which arose
from confounding Holbein's picture, above∣mentioned, with these wood-cuts.
For it will appear, that Hol∣bein's manner of cutting in wood, is entirely
different from that in which these are finished, by comparing them with
Holbein's scrip∣tural wood-cuts (in one of which his name is engraved at full
length) inserted in archbishop Cranmer's catechism, an. 1548. In the cuts
of this catechism there is a delicacy of handling, by no means to be found in
those of the DANCE OF DEATH; which, however, have an inimitable
expression, and are most probably the work of Albert Durer. I am not
ignorant, that Rubens, who had copied this DANCE OF DEATH, recommended them to
Sandrart, as the performance of Holbein: of which Sandrart himself informs
us. 
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>Sic memini,</HI> &amp;c.—I also
well remember, that, in the year 1627, when Paul Rubens came to Utrecht to
visit Handorst, being escorted, both coming from, and returning to
Amsterdam, by several artists, as we were in the boat, the conversation
fell upon Holbein's book of cuts, representing the DANCE OF DEATH; that
Rubens gave them the highest encomiums, ad∣vising me, who was then a young
man, to set the highest value upon them, informing me, at the same time,
that he, in his youth, had copied them."

stiled these prints Holbein's, in familiar conversation, it was but
calling them by the name which the world had given them, and which they
generally went by. In another place Sandrart evidently confounds these
wood-cuts with Holbein's picture at Basil. 
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>Sed in foro, &amp;c.</HI> But in the
fish-mar∣ket there [at Basil] may be seen his [Holbein's] admirable DANCE
OF PEASANTS; where also, in the same public manner, is shewn his DANCE OF
DEATH, where, by a variety of figures, it is demonstrated, that Death
spares neither popes, emperors, princes, &amp;c. as may be seen in his
most elegant wooden-cuts of the same work." 
<BIBL><HI>ibid.</HI> pag. 238.</BIBL></Q> Now the cuts of
which, at present, I am treating, are fifty-three in number, every one of
which has an unity, and is entirely detach'd from the rest; so that, how
could they be representations of one picture? But if it be grant∣ed, that
they were engrav'd from this picture, (which, moreover, from their
dissimilitude, they could not be) how does it follow they were done by
Holbein?</P> 
<P>The book from which Hollar copied these cuts, is printed at
Ba∣sil, 1554, and is thus entitled, 
<Q REND="inline">"ICONES MORTIS, <HI>duodecim imagi∣nibus,

Italian, printed at Lyons, 1549, with this title, 
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>Simolachri, Historie, e Figure de la

the last-mention'd edition, and in the preface of this, it is said, that
this book had been before printed with French and Latin inscriptions, &amp;c.
and from the French edition, I suppose, Aemylius spoken of before,
translated. Spurious edi∣tions of these cuts soon afterwards appear'd,
particularly one at Cologn, dated 1566, in which the forgery is pretty
discernible. It may not be improper to take leave of this subject, by
remarking, that Spenser alludes to some of these representations,
which, in his age, were fashionable and familiar.</P>

written in the species of which I am at <PB N="231" REF="234"/> present
speaking. Lidgate has received numberless encomiums from our old English
poets, to which <PB N="232" REF="235"/> his language entitled him, rather than
his ima∣gination; for though he is a very unaminated writer, yet he made very
considerable improvements in the original state of our English
versification, by writing in so polite a style; and it ought not to be
denied, that Lydgate is the first English poet, who can be red without
hesitation and difficulty. To Lydgate succeeded John Harding, who wrote a
Chro∣nicle, in verse, of all our English kings, from Brutus to the reign of
king Edward IV. in which he liv'd. This piece is often commended, and quoted by
some of our best antiquaries. But his merit, as an histo∣rian, naturally
excludes him from that which he should arrogate as a poet: accuracy in
collecting, and fideli∣ty in relating events, may be, perhaps, justly allow'd
him, but not the least effort of invention. So that, from the specimen
produced by Harding at this time, there was some reason to presage, that
poesy was re∣lapsing into its primaeval barbarism; and that the
rudeness of Robert of Gloucester, would be reinstated 
<PB N="233" REF="236"/> in the place of Chaucer's taste, judgement, and
imagination.</P>
<P>However in the reign of Henry VII. ample amends were made for this
interval of darkness by Stephen Hawes, a name generally unknown, and not
menti∣oned by any English compiler of the lives of English poets, but by
the accurate Wood<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Fast. Oxon.</BIBL></NOTE>.
This author I look upon to be the restorer of invention in our poetry,
whose streams had flow'd in a current still more polluted and
sluggish, ever since the time of Chaucer. He not only reviv'd, but highly
improved the an∣tient allegoric vein, which the rhyming chronicle of the last
mentioned poet had (as I before hinted) now totally expelled. Instead of that
dryness and harsh∣ness of description which are so remarkably
disgusting in his predecessors, we are by this author often
enter∣tained with the fullness and luxuriancy of Spenser-Hawes refin'd
Lydgate's versification, and gave it, what it wanted, sentiment and
invention; added new graces to the seven-lined stanza, which Gower and
Chaucer first introduced into our tongue from the Italian; and, to sum up
all, was the first of our poets, who taught fertile fancy, and high-wrought

his poem is almost as universally un∣known as his name, and is as follows.

<P>In the reign of king Henry VIII. learning appear'd with new
lustre in this island; and this age is perhaps the first which England
ever saw, that may with pro∣priety be styled classical; as it was
dignify'd with the great names of Sir Thomas More, Colet, dean of St. Paul's,
Cheke, Ascham, together with many more illustrious rivals in genius and
erudition Nor is it the most inconsiderable honour of this age, that
Eras∣mus was now entertained and patronized in England; and that the Greek
language, in which are reposited the treasures of true learning now began
to be taught and admir'd. In this age flourish'd John Skelton, who
notwithstanding the great and new lights with which he was surrounded,
contributed not the least share of improvement to what his ancestors had
left him; nor do I perceive that his versification is in any degree more
polish'd than that of his immediate predecessor, Hawes. His best pieces
are written in the allegorical manner, and are, his CROWNE of LAU∣RELL, and
BOWGE OF COURT. But the genius of this author seems little better qualify'd
for pic∣turesque, than for satyrical poetry; in the former, he wants
invention, grace, and dignity; in the lat∣ter, wit, and good manners.</P>
<P>I should be guilty of injustice to merit in particu∣lar, and
to a nation in general, which amidst a variety <PB N="235" REF="238"/> of
disadvantages has kept a constant pace with Eng∣land in the progress of
literature, were I here to omit the mention of two Scottish poets, who
flourish'd a∣bout this time, Sir David Lyndesay, and William Dunbar; the
former of which, in his DREAM, and other pieces, and the latter in his GOLDEN
TERCE, or SHIELD, and in THE THISTLE AND ROSE, has discover'd a genuine
spirit of allegorising. Soon af∣terwards, appear'd a series of poems,
entitled the MIRROR OF MAGISTRATES, form'd upon a

<P>Lydgates's FALL of PRINCES gave rise to the MIRROUR OF
MAGISTRATES. In the year 1559, R. Baldwin was requested to continue Lydgate's
series of the great Unfortunate; but he chose rather to confine himself
entirely to our English story, and began with Robert Tresilian, 1388. and
ended with Lord Hastings, 1483. In this work he was assisted by others;
and particularly by John Sackville, who wrote the life of the Duke of
Buckingham, toge∣ther with this INDUCTION; intending at the same time to
write all those remarkable lives which occurr'd from the Conquest to
Tresi∣lian, with whom Baldwin originally began, and to have printed his
additional part, together with all that Baldwine, and his friends, had already
done, in one volume, and to have prefix'd this INDUC∣TION as a general preface
to the whole. But this was never exe∣cuted. Afterwards another collection was

Syd∣ney, are little better than a biographical detail. There is one piece
indeed among the rest, which exhibits a train of imaginary personages so
beautifully drawn, <PB N="236" REF="239"/> that in all probability they
contributed to stimulate and awaken the imagination of Spenser, in forming
the like descriptions. This however may be affirm'd from demonstration,
that SACKVILLE'S INDUCTION ap∣proaches nearer to the FAERIE QUEENE in allegoric
representation than any previous or succeeding poem.</P>
<P>After the FAERIE QUEENE, allegory began to de∣cline, and by
degrees gave place to a

bones are the foundation of it, the veins it's brooks, &amp;c. Afterwards the
intellectual faculties are represented as persons: but he principally
shines where he personifies the passions or evil concupiscencies of
the heart, who attack the good qualities of the heart alike personified,
which under the conduct of their leader INTELLECT, rout the former. In this
poem there is too somewhat of a metaphysical turn. As the whole is

Whether or no rhime was Milton's talent or not, I shall not determine; but

the action of the FAERIE QUEENE.

requires truth even in fiction itself; and when it is presented with an
allegorical action, it cannot deter∣mine itself, (if I may be allowed the
expression) to enter into the sentiments of those chimerical
person∣ages. It considers them as enigmas and symbols, that envelop
some precepts of morality, or satyrical strokes, which properly belong to
the jurisdiction of the mind. Now a theatrical piece, were it to speak only
to the mind, would never be capable of engag∣ing <PB N="239" REF="242"/> our

<P>IN reading the FAERIE QUEENE some observations necessarily

fierce wars and faithfull loves, yet under these shall be couch'd moral
doctrine, and the pre∣cepts of virtue. Our author, in another place, styles

Pope thinks that our author drew the idea of his false Florimel from that
passage in Homer where Apollo raises a phantom in the shape of Aeneas,
B. 5. Iliad. and from the fictitious Turnus of Virgil; Aen. 10. 637. But he
probably borrow'd it more immediately from romance, where magicians are often
feigned to dress up some wicked spirit with a counterfeit likeness, in
order to carry on their pur∣poses of deception.

<PB N="242" REF="245"/> Spenser, as Mr. Jortin observes, plainly alluded to
this text in the Psalms,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Psal. 19.
5.</BIBL></NOTE> 
<Q REND="inline">"In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun;
which cometh forth as a bridegroom out of his chamber, and rejoyceth as a giant
to run his course."</Q> But our author has strangely inverted the
circumstances. The psalmist alludes to the Jewish custom of the
bridegroom being conducted from his chamber at midnight, with great pomp, and
preceded by a great number of torches. This is the illustration of the
admirable Dr. Jackson, and without it the comparison is of no force or
pro∣priety. The idea which our author would convey is, that, Phoebus came forth
fresh and vigorous as a bridegroom, when he goes to his bride. The
cir∣cumstance of Phoebus 
<Q REND="inline">"came dauncing forth"</Q> seems to have been
copied by Milton in his elegant song on May morning. 
<Q> 
<L>Now the bright morning-star, dayes harbinger,</L> 
<L>Comes dancing from the east.—</L></Q> But probably
Milton drew it from an old poem, cal∣led, the CUCKOW, by R. Niccols, 1607, who
speak∣ing of the east, says, 
<Q> 
<L>From whence the daies bright king came dancing out.</L></Q>
especially as Milton has two thoughts in that song, which are likewise in
the CUCKOW. Milton calls the morning star 
<Q> 
<L>—Day's harbinger.</L></Q> Niccols calls the cock 
<Q> 
<L>—Daies harbinger.</L></Q> <PB N="243" REF="246"/> Milton
says of May,

<L>—Who from her green lap throwes</L> 
<L>The yellow cowslip, &amp;c.</L></Q> Niccols of May, 
<Q> 
<L>And from her fruitfull lap eche day she threw</L> 
<L>The choicest flowres—</L></Q> Milton, I suppose,
had been reading this poem of the CUCKOW just before he wrote his song, and
so im∣perceptibly adopted some of its thoughts and expres∣sions. And
here it may be observ'd, that in critici∣sing upon Milton, Johnson,
Spenser, and some other of our elder poets, not only a competent knowledge
of all antient classical learning is requisite, but also an
acquaintance with those books, which, though now forgotten and lost, were
yet in repute about the time in which each author respectively wrote, and
which it is most likely he had red.

This is highly agreeable to the character of the flat∣tering and deceitful
Comus; and the supposition that she was the goddess or genius of the
wood, resulting from the situation of the persons, is new as well as
pro∣per. <PB N="250" REF="253"/> There is another passage in Comus, whose
sub∣ject is not much unlike that of the verses just pro∣duc'd, which,
probably, Milton copied from Euripides. 
<Q> 
<L>Their port was more than human, as they stood;</L> 
<L>I took it for a faery vision</L> 
<L>Of some gay creatures of the element,</L>

<L>And play i' th' plighted clouds: I was awe-strook,</L> 
<L>And, as I past, I worship'd.—</L></Q> Comus thus
describes to the Lady her brothers. And thus a shepherd, in Iphigenia in
Tauris, describes Py∣lades and Orestes to Iphigenia.

the idea of an ARMED ANGEL. He, pro∣bably, receiv'd some hints, in this

<P>Not many years before the FAERIE QUEENE was written, viz. 1548,
Gelli published his Circe, which is declar'd in the Preface to be founded
upon the Dia∣logue of Plutarch, mention'd by Mr. Jortin. Circe soon became a
very popular book, and was translated into English (as likewise into
other languages) in the Year 1557, by one Henry Iden; so that, probably,
Spenser had red it; and might be induc'd to consult that Dialogue, from its
mention in the preface.

<L>Save Beares, Lyons, and Buls which romed them around.</L></Q>
This verse would be improv'd in its harmony, by reading, 
<Q> 
<L>Save Lyons, Beares, and Buls, &amp;c.</L></Q> As would the
following also, 
<Q> 
<L>Yet was admired much of fooles, <HI>women,</HI> and boyes.</L>

<BIBL>5. 2. 30.</BIBL></Q> If we were to read, 
<Q> 
<L>Yet was admired much of <HI>women,</HI> fooles, and
boyes.</L></Q> But these corrections are made by the critic, upon a
supposition that his author must infallibly have writ∣ten what was
best. It may be laid down as a general rule, that an Alexandrine cannot be
harmonious with∣out a full pause after the third foot. Thus, 
<Q> 
<L>That spear enchanted <HI>was</HI>—which laid thee on
the green.</L></Q> Consequently the sixth syllable must necessarily
be a monosyllable, or the last syllable of a word; for we cannot make a
full pause in the middle of a word, upon which account such Alexandrines as
these are necessarily inharmonious. 
<Q> 
<L>So in his angry <HI>cour—age</HI> fairly pacify'd.</L> 
<L>That bore a Lyon <HI>pass—ant</HI> in a golden
field.</L> 
<L>But that he must do <HI>batt—el</HI> with the
sea-nymph's son.</L> 
<L>And to her watry <HI>cham—ber</HI> swiftly carry
him.</L></Q> <PB N="260" REF="263"/> And because a full pause must be made
on the last syllable of the third foot, the third foot should never
consist of a Trochee, for then we should be oblig'd to lay the greater
stress upon the short syllable; as if the third foot was to be
Beāuty̆, Coūrăge, grēedy̆,
flōwry̆, or the like.</P>
<P>And it may be further remark'd, that an Iambus, for the third
foot, will make the verse more musical, as the pause will be more
strong after a short syllable. Thus, 
<Q> 
<L>Fit to adorn <HI>thĕ dēad,</HI>—and deck
the dreary tomb.</L> 
<L>That art thus <HI>foully̆ flēd</HI>—from
famous enemy.</L></Q> For the same reason an Iambic foot at the end of any
English verse has a good effect.</P>
<P>An Alexandrine entirely consisting of Iambic feet, answers
precisely to a pure Iambic verse of the antients. Thus, 
<Q> 
<L>Thĕ gēntlĕ Evē ăwākes
rĕfrēshfŭll āirs ăroūnd.</L></Q> 
<Q> 
<L><HI>Equēs sŏnāntĕ
vērbĕrābĭt
ūngŭlā.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>In reading this kind of measure, the antients did not, probably,
huddle the syllables together, as we do: but it would be difficult to point
out the places at which they made their pauses. Why should the fol∣lowing
pure Iambic of Sophocles,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Elect. v.

<L><GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>?</L></Q> Which
are not very unlike those which we make use of in reading the above
English Alexandrine (or Iambic) verse, 
<Q> 
<L>The gen-tle Eve-awakes-refresh-full airs-around.</L></Q></P>
<P>It may be observ'd, that a Latin Hexameter is essen∣tially
distinguish'd from a prose sentence, only by being ended with a Dactyle
preceding a Spondee; upon which account our manner of reading the end∣ings of
such Hexameters as these, <HI>procumbit Humi Bos, Oceano Nox, amica Luto
Sus, &amp;c.</HI> is probably wrong. According to our present manner of
reading them, the whole verse doth not differ in sound from an <HI>Ora∣tio
prosaica</HI>; contrary therefore to our present prac∣tice, we should
take care to express the Dactyle and Spondee thus—<HI>Ocean—o
Nox</HI>; and so of the rest. And that this was the practice of the
antients, may be farther infer'd from these words of Quintilian, on reading
verses,

<P>As the name of G. GASCOINE has been frequently mention'd
in the course of this work, it may not be, perhaps, improper to give the
reader some further knowledge of him. His works were print∣ed An. 1576, with
this title, 
<Q REND="inline">"A hundreth sundrie flowres, bounde up
in one small poesie; gather'd, partly by translation, in the fyne and
outlandish gardens of Euripides, Ovid, Petrarke, Ariosto, and others; and
partely by invention, out of our own fruitefull orchardes in Englande; yielding
sundrie sweet savours of tragi∣call, comicall, and morall discourses,
both pleasaunt and profita∣ble to the well-smellyng noses of learned
readers."</Q> This was follow'd by another edition, An. 1587. This author was
well esteem'd by his cotemporary writers, as appears by their testimo∣nies
of him; and it must be confess'd, that he has much exceeded all the poets
of his age, in smoothness and harmony of versification. Would it not
extend this note too far, as a specimen of his talent for love-verses, I
would produce his Ode, 
<Q REND="inline">"In praise of Lady Bridges, now Ladie
Sandes, on a scar on her forehead,"</Q> in which the reader would be
surpriz'd to discover a delicacy, rarely, if ever, to be found in that
early state of our poetry.</P> 
<P>But the reader will, probably, be still more entertain'd
with some passages in JOCASTA, a Tragedie, (before mention'd) written ten
years before the Poem just quoted, and acted at Gray's Inn, 1566, in which he
will not only perceive the strength and harmony, but likewise the poetical
spirit of Spenser, who did not publish any one of his pieces till
fourteen years afterwards. The story is taken, and in some measure
translated, from the PHOENISSAE of Euripides; it is written in blank verse,
with chorusses (none of which are copied from those in the PHOENISSAE);
and before each Act, according to the practice of that age, the Dumb Shew is
introduc'd. In Act 2. 2. combat is likely to ensue, between Eteocles and
Polynices; on which occasion the Chorus, consisting of four Theban dames,
sing an Ode, which thus begins.

<P>When the false Florimel is plac'd by the side of the true
Florimel, the former vanishes into nothing; and as suddenly, says the
poet, as all the glorious colours of the rain-bow fade and perish. With
regard to the circumstance of the sudden evanescence in each, the
comparison is just and elegant: but if we consider, that a rainbow
exists by the presence of the sun, the similitude by no means is made
out: however, it is the former of these circumstances only which the poet
insists upon, so that a partial correspondence only is expected.

<L>That princes bowres adorne with painted imagery.</L></Q> </P>
<P>In the age of the poet, tapestry was the most fashionable
furniture of halls and state-rooms; as it was when Milton wrote his Comus,
who mentions tapestry as a circumstance of grandeur.

<P>As the general fashion of furnishing halls, &amp;c. is at

it, because the ob∣ject from whence it is drawn, does not at present
exist: and we may observe, from this passage, how much of their force
and propriety both expressions and descriptions must necessarily
lose, when the ob∣jects, or customs, or manners, to which they allude, are
out of use, and forgotten. There is another re∣ference to tapestry in

<P>He seems here to have intended a satirical stroke against
the Puritans, who were a prevailing party in the age of Queen Elizabeth; and,
indeed, our au∣thor, from his profession, had some reason to declare
himself their enemy, as poetry was what they parti∣cularly stigmatiz'd, and
bitterly inveigh'd against. In the year 1579, one Stephen Gosson wrote a
pamphlet, with this title, 
<Q REND="inline">"The Schoole of Abuse, containing a pleasaunt
invective against poets, pipers, plaiers, jesters, and such-like
caterpillers of a common∣wealth."</Q> This was soon follow'd by many others
of the same kind.</P>
<P>But the most ridiculous treatise of this sort was that
written many years afterwards by W. Prynne; as a specimen of which, I shall
beg leave to entertain the reader with its title-page. 
<Q REND="inline">"HISTRIOMASTIX, the Players Scourge, or Actors
Tragedie, divided into two parts; wherein it is largely evidenced by divers
arguments, by the concurring authorities, and resolutions of sundry texts
of Scripture; of the whole primitive Church, both under the law and gospel;
of fifty-five Synods and Councils, of seventy-one Fathers, and Christian
writers, before the year of our Lord 1200; of above one hundred and fifty
foraigne and domestic protestant and po∣pish authors since; of forty
heathen philosophers, historians, poets; of many heathen, many christian 
<PB N="292" REF="295"/> nations, republicks, emperors, princes, magistrates;
of sundry apostolical, canonical, imperial constitu∣tions, and of our own
English statutes, magistrates, universities, writers,
preachers.—That popular stage-playes (the very pompes of the devil,
which we renounce in baptisme, if we believe the Fathers) are sinfull,
heathenish, lewd, ungodly spectacles, and most pernicious corruptions;
condemned in all ages as intolerable mischiefes, to churches, to re∣publicks,
the manners, mindes, and soules of men: and that the profession of
play-poets, of stage-play∣ers, together with the penning, acting, and
fre∣quenting of stage-playes, are unlawfull, infamous, and misbeseeming
christians: all pretences to the contrary are here likewise fully
answer'd; and the unlawfullness of acting, of beholding academical
enterludes briefly discussed; besides sundry other particulars
concerning dancing, dicing, health-drinking, &amp;c. London, 1633.</Q></P>
<P>This extravagant and absurd spirit of puritanical
enthusiasm, proved at last, in its effects, as perni∣cious to polite
learning, and the fine arts, as to the liberties and constitution of our
country: while every species of elegance was represented, by these
austere and melancholy zealots, as damnable luxury, and every degree of
decent adoration, as popish idolatry. In short, it is not sufficiently
consider'd, what a rapid and national progress we were, at that time,
making in knowledge, and how sudden a stop was put to it, by the inundation
of presbyterianism and ignorance; which circumstance alone, exclusive
of its other at∣tendant <PB N="293" REF="296"/> evils, gives us ample cause to
detest the pro∣moters of that malignant (I wish I could add, un∣provok'd)
rebellion, which no good man can remem∣ber without horror.</P>
<P>It may not, perhaps, be impertinent to remark here, that Milton,
who was inclin'd to puritanism, had good reason to think, that the
publication of his Samson Agonistes, would be very offensive to his
brethren, who held poetry, and particularly that of the dramatic kind, in
such abhorrence. And, upon this account, it is probable, that, in order to
excuse him∣self for having engag'd in this proscrib'd and forbid∣den
species of writing, he thought it expedient to pre∣fix to his play a formal
DEFENCE OF TRAGEDY, in which he endeavours to prove, that some of the
gravest writers did not scruple to illustrate their dis∣courses from
the works of tragic poets, and that many of the wisest philosophers, and
of the primitive fathers, were not asham'd to write Tragedies.</P>

informs us, that on the top of the moun∣tain Kindaberg, near the castle of
the same name, there was a beautiful garden, the most delicious spot of
ground in all the Northern climate. Into this gar∣den none but old men were
permitted to enter. The admission of young men to a survey of so
delightfull a scene, it was fear'd, might prove too great a relaxa∣tion from
their unintermitted daily discipline, and make such impressions on
their susceptible disposi∣tions, as might be the beginnings of an
effeminate and luxurious life.

<Q REND="inline">"Night drew her shade over the earth: The
mariners contem∣plated from their ships Helice and Orion; the traveller and
door∣keeper were drowsy; the sleeping mother forgott her dead chil∣dren;
there was no barking of dogs heard through the city, nor any loud sound; and
silence attended upon the black darkness.—But sweet sleep did not
seize Medea."</Q> Upon the propriety of these images Mr. Rymer thus
expatiates.</P> 
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"He would say that all the world is fast
asleep but only Medea; and then his mariners, who are gazing from their
ships on Helice and Orion, can serve but little for his purpose; unless
they may be supposed to sleep with their eyes open. Neither dares he
say that the porter and traveller are yet taking a nap, but only that they
have a good mind to't. And after all, we find none but the good woman who had
lost her child (and she indeed is fast) asleep, unless the dogs may
likewise be supposed so, because they had left off barking. And
these methinks were scarce worthy to be taken notice of in an heroic poem,
except we may believe that in the old time, or that in Greek, they bark
heroically."</Q> Our critic here unfortunately sets on upon a
sup∣position absolutely false, viz. that 
<Q REND="inline">"the poet is representing all the world as
fast asleep,"</Q> so that every argument which he draws from this
supposition must necessarily fall to the ground. Apol∣lonius ushers
in his night-piece by telling us, 
<Q REND="inline">"night cover'd the earth with her
shade,"</Q> and afterwards selects such objects and circumstances the
repose and tranquillity of which produce the most striking contrast to,
and consequently most strongly exaggerate the distraction and
inquietude of Medea. Hence he tells us that the mariner was contemplating with
calm attention the constellations of Helice and Orion; or, that now it was
the time, according to Virgil's translation, 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>cum medio volvuntur sydera
lapsu:</HI></Q> or that it was a still, and consequently a silent
night, that even the traveller and door-keeper (whom he singles out, as their
employment implies watching and wakefullness) were now about to fall
asleep; that even the mother (whom we might expect to find awake) had now
forgot her dead babes in slumber; that the dogs had ceased barking thro'
the city, a circumstance highly natural and picturesque of a still night;
that every sound, &amp;c. but, that amidst this situation of things Medea
could not sleep. But what can we expect from a critic who confesses
himself to be struck with this choice represen∣tation of the night in
Dryden's conquest of Mexico? 
<Q> 
<L>All things are husht, as Nature's self lay dead;</L> 
<L>The mountains seem to nod their drowsy head:</L> 
<L>The little birds in dreams their songs repeat,</L> 
<L>And sleeping flowers beneath the night-dew sweat.</L> 
<L>Ev'n Lust and Envy sleep.—</L></Q></P> 
<P>These lines are no bad burlesque; but it is their
misfortune, that they are written without the least intention of producing a
smile. Nor are Mr. Rymer's sentiments upon them a worse specimen of
burlesque criticism, which however are dictated with the most serious
and unaffected gravity.</P> 
<Q> 
<P>In this description, four lines yield greater variety of
matter, and more choice thoughts than twice the number of any other language.
Here is something more fortunate than the boldest fancy has yet reached,
and something more just, than the severest reason has ob∣served.
Here are the flights of Statius and Marino temper'd with a more discerning
judgment, and the judgment of Virgil and Tasso animated with a more
sprightly wit. Nothing has been said so ex∣pressive and so home in
any other language as the first verse in this description. The second
is Statius improv'd. 
<Q> 
<L><HI>Et simulant fessos curvata cacumina
somnos,</HI></L></Q></P> 
<P>Saith Statius, where <HI>simulant</HI> is a bold word in
comparison of our English word <HI>seem,</HI> being of an active
signification; and <HI>ca∣cumina</HI> may as well be taken for the tops of
Trees, as the tops of Mountains, which doubtful meaning does not so well
content the reader, as the certainty.</P> 
<P>In the third verse, 'tis not said that the birds sleep,
but what is more new, and more poetical, their sleep is imply'd, by their
dreams. Somewhat like to the fourth we have in Marino.</P> 
<Q> 
<L>—<HI>E languidetti i fiori</HI></L> 
<L><HI>Giaceano a l'herba genitrice in seno.</HI></L> 
<BIBL>Adonis, Cant. 20.</BIBL></Q> 
<P>Which is a pretty image, but has not so near a resemblance
with truth, nor can so generally be apply'd to all flowers. Our author here
dares not say directly that the flowers sleep, which might sound a little
harsh, but slurs it over in the <HI>participle,</HI> as taken for granted,
and affirms only that they sweat, which the night-dew makes very easie.</P>

<P>In the last half-verse, we may see how far our author
has out∣done Apollonius. 'Twas no such strange thing in the sorrowful
woman when she had spent her tears, for sleep to close her eyes: but
here we have the most raging and watchful passions lust and envy. And
these too instead of the lustful and the envious, for the greater force
and emphasis, in the abstract.</P> 
<P>Some may object, That the third verse does contradict the
first. How can all things be hush'd, if birds in dreams repeat their
songs? Is not this like the indiscretion of Marino? who says, That the
winds and all things are husht, and the seas so fast asleep, that
they snore. Cant. 20.</P> 
<P>It may be answer'd, That in this place 'tis not the poet
that speaks, but another person; and that the poet here truly represents
the nature of man, whose first thoughts break out in bold and more general
terms, which by the second thoughts are more correct and limited. As if one
should say, all things are silent, or asleep how∣ever; if there is any
noise, 'tis still but the effect of sleep, as the dreams of birds,
&amp;c. This comparison might be much further im∣prov'd to our advantage, and
more observations made, which are left to the readers ingenuity.

<P>Where E. K. in explaining it, has discover'd more learning than
penetration. Skinner seems to have wrongly interpreted QUAINT,
<HI>elegans.</HI> If it ever signifies <HI>elegant</HI> or
<HI>beautifull,</HI> it implies a fantastic kind of beauty arising from an
odd variety. Thus Milton in LYCIDAS, of flowers. 
<Q> 
<L>Throw hither all your QUEINT enamel'd eyes.</L></Q> And in
ARCADES; where it expresses an elegance re∣sulting from affectation
rather than nature. 
<Q> 
<L>—And CURL the grove</L> 
<L>In ringlets QUAINT.—</L></Q> Where Milton copies
Johnson, in a MASKE at Wel∣beck, 1633. 
<Q><PB N="303" REF="306"/> 
<L>When was old Sherwoods head more QUEINTLY CURLD?</L></Q></P>
<P>The same poet has likewise drawn one or two more strokes in
the ARCADES, from a mask of Johnson. In song 1. he thus breaks forth, 
<Q> 
<L>This, this is she</L> 
<L>To whom our vows, and wishes, &amp;c.</L></Q> So Johnson
in an Entertainment at Althrope, 1603. 
<Q> 
<L>This is shee,</L> 
<L>This is shee.</L></Q> Milton in Song 3. pays this compliment
to the countess of Derby, 
<Q> 
<L>Tho' Syrinx your Pan's mistress were,</L> 
<L>Yet Syrinx well might wait on her.</L></Q> Thus Johnson in
the same Entertainment. 
<Q> 
<L>And the dame has Syrinx' grace.</L></Q> </P>
<P>These little traits of likeness just lead us to con∣clude,
that Milton before he sate down to write his ARCADES, had recourse to
Johnson (who was the most eminent masque-writer then extant) for the form
and manner proper to this species of composition, and that in the course
of writing it, he naturally fell upon some of Johnson's expressions.

<P>It has been conjectur'd, that Milton took the hint, in some
measure, for writing on MIRTH and ME∣LANCHOLY, from the Ode prefix'd to
Burton's ME∣LANCHOLY. In support of this supposition I shall add, that
Milton had certainly been consulting that treatise before he wrote his two

<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT.</HEAD>
<P>IN the close of this work, it may not be perhaps im∣proper to
subjoin an apology for the manner in which I have conducted it.</P>
<P>And first it may be objected in general, that these
observations would have been rendered more useful and <PB N="310" REF="313"/> convenient had they been printed together with Spenser's text,
arrang'd in their respective places; at least it may be urged that such a
plan would have prevented much unnecessary transcription. But I was
dissuaded from such a procedure by two reasons; the first is, The
observations, (the last section excepted) as they now stand, reduced to
general heads, appear to be so many distinct essays on Spenser; and
thus methodized, are intended to form a kind of systematical critcism on
the FAERIE QUEENE. The second is, that a formal edition of this poem with
notes, would have been impertinent, as such a work is at present expected
from the hands of two learned and ingenious critics.</P>
<P>As to particular ejections, too many, I am sensi∣ble, must
occur; one of which will probably be, that I have been more diligent in
pointing out the faults than the beauties of this author. That I have been
deficient in encomiums on particular passages, did not proceed from a want
of perceiving or acknowledging beauties, but from a persuasion, that
nothing is more absurd or useless than the panegyrical comments of
those, who criticise from the imagination, rather than from the judgement,
who exert their admiration instead of their reason, and discover more of
enthusiasm than discernment. And this must necessarily, (it will
however most commonly) be the case of those, who undertake to point out
beauties; which, as they will naturally approve themselves to the reader by
their own force, so no reason can often be given why they please. The
same cannot always be said of faults, which I have <PB N="311" REF="314"/>
frequently displayed without palliation;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See more
particularly Sect. 1.</NOTE> it being my chief aim, together with that of
particular illustration, to give an impartial estimate of the merit of this
origi∣nal genius.</P>
<P>I cannot take my final leave of the reader without acknowledging
that this task has been peculiarly de∣lightful to me; tho' the business
of criticism is gene∣rally laborious and dry, yet it has here more frequently
amused than fatigu'd my attention, in it's exercises upon an author who
makes such perpetual and power∣ful appeals to the fancy. The pleasure which
Spenser received in composing the FAERIE QUEENE must necessarily be
shared by it's commentator; and the critic, on this occasion, may venture
to exclaim with the poet, 
<Q> 
<L>The waies thro' which my weary steppes I guide</L> 
<L>In this DELIGHTFULL LAND OF FAERY,</L> 
<L>Are so exceeding spacious and wide,</L> 
<L>And sprinkled with such sweet varietie</L> 
<L>Of all that pleasant is to ear or eye,</L> 
<L>That I nigh ravisht with rare thoughts delight,</L> 
<L>My tedious travel do forgett thereby,</L> 
<L>And when I gin to feel decay of might,</L> 
<L>It strength to me supplies, and cheares my dulled
spright.</L>
