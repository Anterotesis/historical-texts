<P>The Examples are selected from <HI>Predictions</HI> in the Old Testament, of NATIONAL JUDGEMENTS, which (being compared with their actual Accomplishment) demonstrate <HI>"the sure Word of Prophecy,"</HI> as well as the <HI>immediate Interposition of</HI> DIVINE PROVIDENCE, <HI>to recompence impenitent</HI> NATIONS <HI>according to their Works.</HI></P>

<PB REF="4"/>
<HEAD>THE LAW OF RETRIBUTION.</HEAD>
<P>THE AFRICAN SLAVE-TRADE has been publicly supported and encouraged by <HI>the Legislature of this King∣dom</HI> for near a century last past; so that the <HI>monstrous destruction of the Human Species,</HI> which is <HI>annually</HI> occasioned thereby, may certainly be esteemed a <HI>National Crime</HI> of the most aggravating kind, which (according to the usual course of God's Providence in the World) will probably draw down some exemplary vengeance upon the unre∣penting Inhabitants of this Island! And, with respect to the <HI>British Colonies,</HI> the
<PB N="2" REF="5"/>uncharitable practice of <HI>Slave-holding,</HI> especially in the West-India Islands and the more Southern Colonies, is grown up into a more enormous and destructive <HI>Oppression</HI> (whether we view the prodi∣gious multitudes of the <HI>Oppressed,</HI> or the unconscionable severity of the <HI>Oppressors</HI>) than perhaps ever disgraced any other Nation at any one period of time!</P>
<P>The several attempts that have lately been made to justify these two branches of abominable National Iniquity by the Holy Scriptures, and especially by the permission therein granted to <HI>the Israelites</HI> to <HI>purchase</HI> and <HI>retain Slaves</HI> among them, have induced me to collect, from the History of <HI>the Jews</HI> in the several Books of Holy Scripture, some plain examples of God's Vengeance upon that particular Nation, expressly for this kind of <HI>Op∣pression;</HI> which, I hope, will sufficiently prove that <HI>Slavery</HI> was ever detestable in
<PB N="3" REF="6"/>the sight of God, and consequently that a speedy Reformation is absolutely ne∣cessary (as well with respect to the <HI>African Slave-trade,</HI> encouraged in this Kingdom, as the <HI>Toleration of Slavery</HI> in the British American Dominions) if we mean to entertain the least hope of escaping a severe <HI>National Retribution,</HI> which (if we may judge by our present Civil Dissentions and horrid <HI>mutual</HI> Slaughters of <HI>National Brethren</HI>) seem ready to burst upon us!</P>
<P>I am well aware, indeed, how very unfashionable it is, now-a-days, to quote <HI>Scripture,</HI> when matters of <HI>Law, Politics,</HI> or <HI>Trade</HI> are called in question; yet I flat∣ter myself that the following examples, drawn from thence, are perfectly suitable to my present point, and consequently must have weight to convince all persons, who sincerely acknowledge the <HI>Truth of the Scriptures,</HI> that we have the greatest
<PB N="4" REF="7"/>reason to apprehend the infliction of some heavy Judgement from Almighty God upon these Kingdoms, on account of the monstrous load of Guilt which the British Subjects, <HI>on each side of the Atlan∣tic,</HI> have incurred by the <HI>Oppressions</HI> above-mentioned.</P>
<P>In some former Tracts I have already shewn that the Servitude which the Jews, by the Mosaic Law, were permitted to exact of <HI>their Brethren</HI> (even when the latter were <HI>sold</HI> to them) was very much <HI>limited;</HI> that they were not to be treated as <HI>Bond Servants</HI> <NOTE N="(1)" PLACE="foot"><Q>If thy <HI>Brother</HI> (that dwelleth) by thee be waxen poor, and be <HI>sold unto thee,</HI> thou shalt not compel him to serve as <HI>a Bond Servant:</HI> but as an Hired Servant, and as a Sojourner, he shall be with thee,</Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Levit. xxv. 39, 40.</NOTE> but as <HI>Hired Ser∣vants;</HI> that the <HI>Servitude</HI> could not law∣fully be extended beyond <HI>seven years</HI> <NOTE N="(2)" PLACE="foot"><Q>If thou buy an Hebrew Servant, six years he shall serve, and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing.</Q> Exod. xxi. 2.</NOTE>
<PB N="5" REF="8"/>unless the Servant loved <HI>his Master</HI> and Condition, and voluntarily demanded<NOTE N="(3)" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>And if the Servant shall <HI>plainly</HI> say, <HI>I love</HI> my Master, my Wife, and my Children; <HI>I will not go out free:</HI></Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Exod. xxi. 5. Thus it is evident that the Jews could not acquire <HI>any right</HI> to the perpe∣tual Service of their <HI>Brethren,</HI> John or Thomas, except by virtue of <HI>a voluntary Contract,</HI> which is something similar to that Clause in the Habeas Corpus Act con∣cerning a Contract, which I thought myself obliged to acknowledge in my former Tract as an exception to the idea of Universal <HI>Freedom</HI> in this Kingdom. But in neither case can the <HI>Contract</HI> for Service be <HI>im∣plied;</HI> for in the latter the Contract must be <HI>in writing,</HI> and the signing be clearly proved to be <HI>a voluntary act,</HI> without the least suspicion of <HI>Duress;</HI> and in the for∣mer case it was necessary that the Servant should ac∣knowledge, in <HI>a Court of Record,</HI> that he was <HI>willing</HI> to enter into such a Contract; for the Hebrew <HI>Servant</HI> could not be made a <HI>Slave,</HI> unless he would <Q><HI>plainly say,</HI> I love my Master,</Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> <Q>I WILL NOT GO OUT FREE: Then</Q> (says the Text) <Q>his Master shall bring him <HI>unto the</HI> JUDGES</Q> (which an∣swers to the public <HI>Acknowledgement</HI> necessary in the other case to be made in <HI>a Court of Record</HI>) for with∣out this the Hebrew Master had no authority to bore the Servant's Ear in token of Bondage. Exod. xxi. 5, 6.</P></NOTE> of him to continued in his Service; and that, in every other case, it was
<PB N="6" REF="9"/>absolutely unlawful to hold a Brother Hebrew in Slavery.</P>
<P>I have likewise shewn, that, under the glorious Dispensation of the Gospel, we are absolutely bound to consider our∣selves as <HI>Citizens of the World;</HI> that every Man whatever, without any <HI>partial dis∣tinction</HI> of Nation, Distance, or Com∣plexion, must necessarily be esteemed <HI>our Neighbour,</HI> and <HI>our Brother;</HI> and that we are absolutely bound in Christian Duty to entertain <HI>a Disposition</HI> towards <HI>all Mankind</HI> as charitable and benevo∣lent, <HI>at least,</HI> as that which was required of the Jews, under the Law, towards their <HI>national Brethren;</HI> and, conse∣quently, that it is absolutely unlawful for those, <HI>who call themselves Christians,</HI> to exact of <HI>their Brethren</HI> (I mean <HI>their Brethren of the Universe</HI>) a more burthen∣some Service than that to which the Jews were limited with respect to their
<PB N="7" REF="10"/><HI>Brethren</HI> of the House of Israel; and the Slavery, or involuntary Bondage, of <HI>a Brother Israelite</HI> was absolutely forbid.</P>
<P>These premises naturally lead us to consider the severe NATIONAL JUDGE∣MENTS which the Jews brought upon themselves principally <HI>by exceeding these very limitations</HI> which I have here speci∣fied: and the inevitable conclusion to be drawn from these examples is, that we are <HI>absolutely</HI> in danger of THE LIKE JUDGEMENTS, if we do not immediately put a stop to all <HI>similar Oppression</HI> by <HI>Na∣tional Authority:</HI> because an uncharitable extension of the <HI>said limits,</HI> by those who call themselves Christians, will certainly be, at least, <HI>as heinous in the sight of God</HI> as the OPPRESSION OF BRETHREN under the Law; and probably much more so, if we consider the purity and benevo∣lence which is required of all Men under the Gospel Dispensation: and I have
<PB N="8" REF="11"/>clearly proved (I trust) that the permis∣sion to the Israelites, to keep <HI>Bondmen of the Heathen</HI> (or more properly the <HI>Na∣tions, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>) that were round about them,</HI> and of <Q>the Children of <HI>the Strangers</HI> that dwelt among them,</Q> cannot be extended to <HI>any other People</HI> whatever except <HI>the Israelites</HI> themselves; and that even to them it was only <HI>temporary,</HI> during the Dispensation of the Mosaic Law, whilst they possessed the Land of Canaan, the former Inhabitants of which (<HI>viz.</HI> the seven abominable <HI>Nations</HI> of Palestine, expressly mentioned by name in the seventh Chapter of Deuteronomy, where the same Heb. Noun <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, ren∣dered <HI>Heathen</HI> in the former Text, is properly expressed by the English word <HI>Nations</HI>) the Israelites were expressly directed to drive out, kill, and destroy, <HI>without pity</HI> <NOTE N="(4)" PLACE="foot">"Thine eye shall have <HI>no pity</HI> upon them." Deut. vii. 16.</NOTE>, and to make <HI>no Covenant</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="12"/>with them<NOTE N="(5)" PLACE="foot"><Q>Thou shalt make <HI>no Covenant</HI> with them, nor <HI>shew Mercy</HI> unto them,</Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Deut. vii. 2.</NOTE>: and I hope I have also proved that <HI>the remainder</HI> of these parti∣cular wicked Nations, thus expressly doomed to destruction, were undoubtedly "the <HI>Heathen</HI>" (or <HI>Nations</HI>) <Q><HI>that dwelt round about</HI></Q> the Israelites, and <Q><HI>the Children of the Strangers,</HI></Q> whom (and <HI>whom alone</HI>) it was lawful to hold <HI>in perpetual Bondage;</HI> for otherwise that permission cannot be reconciled to God's positive Commands, given in the same Law, to <HI>love</HI> the <HI>Stranger.</HI> <Q>The Lord your God is God of Gods, and Lord of Lords, a great God, a mighty and a terrible, <HI>which regardeth not Persons</HI></Q> (so that this was apparently a general Law, or Rule of Conduct, towards <HI>all Persons,</HI> except the People of those <HI>parti∣cular Nations</HI> which were expressly, <HI>by name,</HI> condemned to destruction by the hands of the Israelites, in other parts of
<PB N="10" REF="13"/>the Law, for their abominable wicked∣ness) <Q>nor taketh Reward: he doth ex∣ecute the Judgement of the Father∣less and Widow, and <HI>loveth the Stran∣ger,</HI> in giving him food and raiment. LOVE YE THEREFORE <HI>the Stranger</HI></Q> (and the Almighty incul∣cates a sympathetic concern for the wel∣fare and happiness of <HI>Strangers,</HI> by re∣minding the Israelites of their own un∣happy situation formerly in a <HI>strange</HI> country) "for ye" (says the Text) <Q>were <HI>Strangers</HI> in the Land of Egypt.</Q> Deut. x. 17 to 19. See also Levit. xix. 33, 34. <HI>"Thou shalt love him"</HI> (that is, <HI>the Stranger</HI>) <Q><HI>as thyself;</HI> for ye were <HI>Strangers</HI> in the Land of Egypt.</Q></P>
<P><HI>National</HI> Wickedness, from the be∣ginning of the World, has generally been visited with <HI>National</HI> Punishments: and surely no <HI>National</HI> Wickedness can be more heinous in the sight of God,
<PB N="11" REF="14"/>than a public toleration of <HI>Slavery and Oppression!</HI> for Tyranny (in whatsoever shape it appears) must necessarily be esteemed a presumptuous breach of that Divine Command, in which <Q><HI>all Law is fulfilled</HI></Q> (Gal. v. 14.) <HI>viz.</HI> <Q>Thou shalt love thy Neighbour as thyself.</Q> Levit. xix. 18.</P>
<P>The Histories of all Nations, indeed, afford tremendous examples of <HI>God's Vengeance</HI> against Tyrants; but no His∣tory is so proper to illustrate this sub∣ject (which now so nearly concerns us) as that of the Jews: for as the Know∣ledge of the <HI>Divine Law</HI> was revealed in a more particular manner to <HI>that People,</HI> and to others <HI>only through them,</HI> so the effect even of their Disobedience was an exemplary demonstration, from time to time, of <HI>God's Vengeance,</HI> as well as of <HI>his Mercy,</HI> for the instruction of all other Nations, amongst whom they
<PB N="12" REF="15"/>are now dispersed, as living monuments of the same to this very day: and we have the authority of an Apostle<NOTE N="(6)" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. x. 11.</NOTE> to assert, that <Q>all these things happened unto them for ensamples; and they are written</Q> (says he) <Q>for our ad∣monition, upon whom the ends of the world are come.</Q></P>
<P>One of the first and most signal in∣stances of Mercy which the Almighty was pleased to shew that People, after they <HI>became a Nation,</HI> was, the restoring them to their <HI>Natural Freedom</HI> from the deplorable <HI>Slavery</HI> in which they were detained by a tyrannical Egyptian Monarch<NOTE N="(7)" PLACE="foot"><P>— <Q>the Children of Israel sighed by reason of <HI>the Bondage,</HI> and <HI>they cried;</HI> and their cry came up unto God <HI>by reason of the Bondage:</HI> and God <HI>heard their groaning,</HI></Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Exod. ii. 23, 24.</P>
<P><Q>And the Lord said, I have <HI>surely seen the Affliction of my People</HI> which are in Egypt, and have <HI>heard their cry</HI> by reason of their <HI>Task-masters:</HI> for I know their Sorrows, and I am come down <HI>to deli∣ver them</HI> out of the hand of the Egyptians.</Q> Exod. iii. 7, 8.</P></NOTE>: and the tremendous
<PB N="13" REF="16"/>Judgements whereby this deliverance was effected (<HI>viz.</HI> the Plagues of Egypt) are so many signal examples of <HI>God's severe Vengeance against Slave-holders,</HI> which ought to be had in everlasting remembrance, to warn all Nations of the World against the unnatural and baneful practice of <HI>keeping Slaves.</HI></P>
<P>This deliverance from <HI>Bondage</HI> was frequently mentioned, even in the words of God himself, by his Prophets, from time to time (as I have before remarked) —"Thus saith the Lord" (<HI>i. e.</HI> Jeho∣vah) <Q>God of Israel: I brought you up from Egypt, and brought you forth <HI>out of the House of Bondage;</HI></Q> (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, more <HI>literally</HI> <Q>from the House
<PB N="14" REF="17"/><HI>of Slaves"</HI>) and <HI>I delivered you</HI> out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of <HI>all that oppressed you,</HI></Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Judges vi. 8. — <Q>I re∣moved his <HI>Shoulder from the Burden;</HI> his <HI>Hands were delivered from the Pats</HI> <NOTE N="(8)" PLACE="foot"><P>In like manner there are multitudes of poor people retained in <HI>a deplorable Bondage,</HI> even to this day, in <HI>the Potteries</HI> of China.</P></NOTE>: thou calledst in trouble, and I delivered thee.</Q> Psal. lxxxi. 6, 7.</P>
<P>The Israelites themselves were also particularly directed <HI>to remember</HI> this signal exertion of Divine Mercy and Power in the cause of <HI>Popular Freedom: "Remember</HI> that thou wast <HI>a Servant" (viz. a Slave)</HI> <Q>in the Land of Egypt, and that the Lord thy God <HI>brought thee out</HI> thence <HI>through a mighty hand,</HI> and by a stretched-out arm,</Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Deut. v. 15.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="18"/>It was surely for the moral purpose of stirring up in the Israelites a sympa∣thetic concern for the Sufferings of the <HI>Oppressed,</HI> and more particularly of <HI>Op∣pressed Strangers,</HI> that they were so fre∣quently reminded of their own former deplorable condition <HI>in Slavery,</HI> and of their miraculous <HI>Deliverance</HI> from thence; being expressly referred to their <HI>own Feelings</HI> and <HI>Remembrance</HI> of the cruel <HI>foreign</HI> Tyranny, which they themselves had so lately experienced in Egypt: — <Q>thou shalt not oppress <HI>a Stranger:</HI> for <HI>ye</HI> KNOW THE HEART</Q> (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, properly THE SOUL) <Q>OF A STRANGER, seeing ye were <HI>Stran∣gers</HI> in the Land of Egypt.</Q> Exod. xxiii. 9.</P>
<P>God also gave the Israelites due warn∣ing of the Danger of <HI>Oppression,</HI> by de∣claring that he would SURELY re∣venge the Cause of the injured <HI>Stranger:</HI>
<PB N="16" REF="19"/><Q>Thou shalt neither <HI>vex a Stranger,</HI> nor <HI>oppress him;</HI> for ye were <HI>Strangers</HI> in the Land of Egypt. Ye shall not afflict any Widow or fatherless Child. If thou afflict them in any wise, and <HI>they cry at all unto me, I will SURELY hear their cry</HI></Q> (mark this, ye African Traders <HI>of this Island,</HI> and ye <HI>West-India</HI> and <HI>British American</HI> Slave-holders! for ye are all guilty of the like abominable <HI>Oppressions,</HI> and God will SURELY avenge the Cause of <HI>the Oppressed</HI>) <Q>and my wrath shall wax hot, and I will kill you with the sword, and your Wives shall be Widows, and your Children fatherless.</Q> Exod. xxii. 21 to 24.</P>
<P>And have not the careless Inhabitants of Great Britain and her Colonies too much reason also to apprehend that <HI>the same God</HI> (who <HI>professes</HI> to <HI>hear the cry</HI> of oppressed <HI>Strangers,</HI> if they <HI>cry at
<PB N="17" REF="20"/>all</HI> unto him) will, sooner or later, visit these Kingdoms with some signal mark of his Displeasure, for the notorious <HI>Oppression</HI> of an almost innumerable mul∣titude of poor <HI>African Strangers,</HI> that are harrassed, and continually wearing out, with a most shameful involuntary Servitude in the <HI>British Colonies!</HI> nay, and that by a public Toleration, under the sanction of Laws to which the Mo∣narchs of England, from time to time, by the advice of their Privy Counsellors, have given <HI>the Royal Assent,</HI> and thereby rendered themselves Parties in <HI>the Op∣pression,</HI> and (it is to be feared) Par∣takers of the Guilt!</P>
<P>Let us not forget, before it is too late, that the Almighty has not only declared, himself ready to "HEAR THE CRY" <HI>of the oppressed Stranger,</HI> but hath deigned to add to his glorious Name, <HI>Jehovah,</HI> a brief <HI>Remembrance</HI> of his merciful inter∣position
<PB N="18" REF="21"/>in behalf of an <HI>enslaved Nation:</HI> "I am the Lord your God" (or <HI>Jehovah</HI> your God, said the Almighty to the Israelites) <Q>which <HI>brought thee out of the Land of Egypt, out of the House of Bondage,</HI></Q> Exod. xx. 1. Thus the Almighty Deliverer from <HI>Slavery</HI> vouch∣safed to set his own Divine Example before the eyes of his redeemed People, to excite Benevolence and Thankful∣ness; and the like Remembrance of that glorious Redemption from <HI>Sla∣very</HI> was very frequently repeated from time to time; which the Scriptures sufficiently testify: but alas! the Isra∣elites profited so little by these whole∣some lessons, that it became necessary, no less frequently, to remind them of <HI>the dreadful Vengeance</HI> which would in∣evitably overtake them for their noto∣rious <HI>Oppressions of the Poor;</HI> for their unjust Exactions of <HI>involuntary and un∣rewarded Service;</HI> and for exceeding the
<PB N="19" REF="22"/><HI>limitations</HI> of <HI>Bondage</HI> (already recited) which the Law expressly enjoined!</P>
<P><Q>For the <HI>Oppression</HI> of the Poor, for the <HI>Sighing</HI> of the Needy, now will I <HI>arise,</HI> saith the Lord; and will set him in safety from him that puffeth at him,</Q> or <Q>that would ensnare him.</Q> Psal. xii. 5.</P>
<P>The Princely Prophet Isaiah plainly declared to them, that their public Fasts and outward Humiliations were not only vain, but even offensive to God, while <HI>such notorious Oppressions</HI> continued among them. "Behold" (said he) <Q>in the day of your Fast, you find Pleasure, and <HI>exact all your Labours.</HI></Q> <NOTE N="(9)" PLACE="foot"><P>Sunt inter quos Belgae, qui hic intelligunt <HI>Opera Servilia,</HI> quae a <HI>Servis</HI> &amp; <HI>Ancillis</HI> hoc ipso di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>rigide ex∣igebantur,</HI> ut aliis diebus. <HI><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> "<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>," Omnes Subjectos vobis affligitis:</HI> quae lectio (says Vitringa) absque emendatione facile sub∣sistit. — And a little afterwards he adds, Prior inter∣pretatio <HI>de Operibus Servorum</HI> aut <HI>molestis exactionibus Subditerum,</HI> magna se commendat specie, estque mihi in eam pronior animus.</P></NOTE> lviii. 3.
<PB N="20" REF="23"/>And again, — <Q>Is it such a Fast that I have chosen? a day for a Man to af∣flict his Soul? is it to bow down his head as a bulrush?</Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> <Q>Is not this the Fast that I have chosen?— to loose <HI>the Bands of Wickedness,</HI> to undo <HI>the heavy Burthens</HI></Q> (or rather <HI>the Bundles of the Yoke,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> plainly referring to the severe and <HI>unjust Bondage of the Poor</HI>) <Q>and TO LET THE OPPRESSED GO FREE, and that YE BREAK EVERY YOKE?</Q> — <Q>Is it not to deal thy Bread to the Hungry, and to bring the Poor that are <HI>cast out</HI></Q> (or rather to bring the Poor that are <HI>reduced,</HI> or <HI>depressed, viz.</HI> as it were by Tyrants; for so the word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> seems more properly to signify in this place) <HI>"to thy House?" &amp;c.</HI> Compare this
<PB N="21" REF="24"/>with Deut. xxiii. 15, 16.<NOTE N="(9)" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>Thou shalt not deliver unto his Master the Servant which is escaped from his Master</HI> unto thee: he shall <HI>dwell with thee (even)</HI> among you, in that place which he shall choose, <HI>in one of thy gates</HI> where it liketh him best: thou shalt not <HI>oppress him.</HI> Deut. xxiii. 15, 16.</P></NOTE> And he warned them of the Divine Justice that would pursue them for their Oppression and tyrannical Treatment of the Poor.</P>
<P><Q>The Lord standeth up to plead, and standeth to judge the People!

Isa. iii. 13 to 15.</P>
<P>The wicked practices whereby the Israelites reduced their poor <HI>Brethren</HI> to
<PB N="22" REF="25"/><HI>Slavery</HI> are described by the Prophet Amos: <Q>Hear this, O ye that <HI>swallow up the Needy,</HI> even to make <HI>the Poor of the Land to fail,</HI> saying, When will the New Moon be gone, that we may sell Corn? and the Sabbath, that we may set forth Wheat, making the Ephah small, and the Shekel great, and falsifying the Ballances by Deceit?

<P>Here is a solemn Appeal from God to the <HI>Human Understanding:</HI> <Q>Shall not the Land tremble <HI>for this!</HI></Q> that is, for this same <HI>abominable Oppression</HI> of the Poor <HI>(the buying them for Slaves)</HI> in which Great Britain and her Co∣lonies are infinitely more guilty than the People to whom this appeal was made! and <HI>"shall not the Land"</HI> (therefore) <Q><HI>even our Land, tremble for this, and every one mourn that dwelleth therein?</HI></Q> <HI>&amp;c. Surely</HI> <Q><HI>God will never forget any of these Works,</HI></Q> my Countrymen!</P>
<P>The Prophet Jeremiah manifestly alluded to the like deceitful practices
<PB N="24" REF="27"/>of the Jews (whereby they reduced the Poor to <HI>Slavery</HI>) when he made a so∣lemn protest against them in the Name of God:—"Your sins" (said he) <Q>have withholden good things from you. For among my People are found wicked (men): they lay wait as he <HI>that setteth Snares;</HI> THEY SET A TRAP, THEY CATCH MEN. As a Cage (or Coup) is full of Birds, so are their Houses full of Deceit: therefore they are become great, and waxen rich. They are waxen fat, they shine: yea, they overpass the deeds of the Wicked; they judge not the cause, the cause of the Father∣less, yet they prosper; and the right of the Needy do they not judge. Shall I not visit for these things? saith the Lord! Shall not <HI>my Soul be avenged on such a Nation as this?</HI></Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Jer. v. 26 to 29. Here again the Al∣mighty plainly appeals to the Human.
<PB N="25" REF="28"/>Understanding concerning the Propri∣ety, or rather the Necessity, of exert∣ing the Divine Vengeance against such an <HI>Oppressive Nation!</HI></P>
<P>And yet how inconsiderable was the crime of the Jewish Nation in this re∣spect, if compared with the <HI>numerous Bondage</HI> and with the unbounded Op∣pression of the poor Negroes in the Bri∣tish Colonies? Have we not therefore just reason to fear that God will <Q><HI>visit for these things?</HI></Q> Does not the Word of God, which cannot change, appeal to us, my Countrymen, as well as to the Jews?—<HI>"Shall not my Soul"</HI> (saith the Lord!) <Q><HI>be avenged on such a Na∣tion as this?</HI></Q></P>
<P>The same Prophet, in the next chap∣ter, declares <HI>the Divine Vengeance</HI> to be at hand: — <Q>For thus hath the Lord of Hosts said,—Hew ye down Trees,
<PB N="26" REF="29"/>and cast a Mount <HI>against Jerusalem.</HI> This (is) the City to be visited! she is <HI>wholly Oppression</HI> in the midst of her. As a Fountain casteth out her Waters, so she casteth out her Wick∣edness: <HI>Violence and Spoil</HI> is heard in her; before me continually is <HI>Grief and Wounds!</HI> Be thou instructed, O Jerusalem! lest my Soul depart from thee: lest I make thee desolate, a Land not inhabited!</Q> Jer. vi. 6 to 8.</P>
<P>But in vain were the Warnings of the Prophet, till <HI>the Judgements</HI> them∣selves began to appear <HI>in all the horrors of a hopeless War,</HI> which began in the ninth year<NOTE N="(11)" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon came, he and all his host, against Jerusalem, and pitched against it: and they built forts against it round about.</Q> 2 Kings xxv. 1.— <Q>In the ninth year of Zedekiah King of Judah, in the tenth month, came Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon, and all his army, against Jerusalem, and they besieged it,</Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Jer. xxxix. 1. See also chap. lii. ver. 9.</P></NOTE> of King Zedekiah's
<PB N="27" REF="30"/>reign, notwithstanding that the Mo∣narch had previously rendered himself secure (as he thought) by his military preparations (in sending for <HI>Horses</HI> and <HI>Men</HI> from Egypt, to complete his stand∣ing Army) and had also made Pharaoh (another presumptuous military Tyrant) his Ally, which encouraged him to break his Oath and Covenant with the King of Babylon.</P>
<P>But <Q>when Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon, and <HI>all his Army, and all the Kingdoms of the Earth, of his Do∣minion, and all the People, fought against Jerusalem, and against all the Cities thereof</HI></Q> —then God ordered his Prophet to remind Zedekiah of that dreadful Vengeance, Defeat and Cap∣tivity,
<PB N="28" REF="31"/>which had so often before been denounced as the necessary consequences of <HI>Oppression and Injustice!</HI> — <Q>Thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel</Q> (<HI>viz.</HI> to Jeremiah): <Q>Go, and speak to Zedekiah King of Judah, and tell him, Thus saith the Lord; behold, I will <HI>give this City into the hand</HI> of the King of Babylon; and he shall burn it with fire. And thou shalt not escape out of his hand, but shalt surely be taken, and delivered into his hand; and <HI>thine eyes shall behold the eyes of the King of Babylon,</HI> and he shall speak with thee <HI>mouth to mouth,</HI> and thou shalt go to Babylon,</Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Jer. xxxiv. 1 to 3.</P>
<P>The impending <HI>Vengeance</HI> being then become <HI>visible,</HI> and consequently more tremendous, by the near approach of the Babylonian Army, that irresisti∣ble instrument in the hand of God, by
<PB N="29" REF="32"/>which the Jews had so often been sub∣dued, the King's stubborn heart began to relent, and his <HI>military confidence</HI> to forsake him, which had before encou∣raged his <HI>Injustice;</HI> his firmness in <HI>Worldly Politics</HI> was shaken, and yielded to a sense of Guilt! It was upon this return of Conscience and right Reason that Zedekiah sent two Messengers, Passur and Zephaniah, to Jeremiah, saying, <Q>Enquire, I pray thee, of the Lord for us; for Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon maketh war against us; if so be the Lord will <HI>deal with us</HI> according to <HI>all his wondrous works,</HI> that he may go up from us,</Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> See chap. xxi. ver. 1 and 2. But a very unwelcome answer was given to the Messengers, to be returned to their Mo∣narch; for the Prophet confirmed all the heavy Judgements<NOTE N="(12)" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>Then said Jeremiah unto them, Thus shall ye say to Zedekiah: Thus saith the Lord God of Israel; Behold, I will turn back the weapons of war that are in your hands, wherewith ye fight against the King of Babylon, and against the Chal∣deans which besiege you without the walls; and I will bring them <HI>into the midst</HI> of this City. And I myself will fight against you, with an outstretched arm, and with a strong arm, even in anger, and in fury, and in great wrath. And I will smite the Inhabitants of this City, both Man and Beast: they shall die of a great Pestilence. And afterwards, saith the Lord, I will deliver <HI>Zedekiah King of Ju∣dah,</HI> and <HI>his Servants,</HI> and <HI>the People,</HI> and such as are left in this City, from the Pestilence, from the Sword, and from the Famine, into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon, and into the hand of their Enemies, and into the hand of those that seek their Life; and he shall smite them with the Edge of the Sword; he shall not spare them, neither have Pity, nor have Mercy!</Q> Jer. xxi. 3 to 7.</P></NOTE> which had
<PB N="30" REF="33"/>before been denounced, as well against the King, expressly by name, as against the City and its iniquitous Inhabitants, whose notorious <HI>Oppressions</HI> were now <HI>to be</HI> RECOMPENSED <HI>upon their own heads,</HI> MEASURE FOR MEASURE: — <Q>Now is the end come upon thee, and <HI>I will send mine anger upon thee, and will judge
<PB N="31" REF="34"/>thee according to thy ways,</HI> and will RECOMPENSE <HI>upon thee all thine abo∣minations,</HI></Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Ezek. vii. 3. See also the 4th, 8th, and 9th verses, to the same effect. And afterwards, in the 11th verse, one of the principal causes of GOD's <HI>Vengeance</HI> is mentioned:—<HI>"Vio∣lence"</HI> (said the Prophet) <Q>is risen up into <HI>a Rod of Wickedness:</HI> none of them shall remain, nor of their mul∣titude, nor of any of their's; neither shall there be wailing for them. The time is come, the day draweth near.</Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI>—And again, in the 23d verse:— <HI>"Make a Chain"</HI> (said the Prophet); <Q>for the Land is full of <HI>bloody Crimes,</HI> and the City is full of <HI>Violence.</HI> Wherefore <HI>I will bring the worst</HI> of the Heathen, and they shall possess their houses,</Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> — <Q>Destruction cometh; and they shall seek peace, and there shall be none. Mischief shall come upon mischief, and rumour
<PB N="32" REF="35"/>shall be upon rumour,</Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI>— <Q>The King shall mourn, and the Prince shall be clothed with desolation, and the Hands of the People of the Land shall be troubled: <HI>I will do unto them after their</HI> (own) <HI>way,</HI> and according to <HI>their</HI> deserts</Q> (or rather <HI>their own judgements</HI>) <Q>will I judge them; and they shall know that I am the Lord.</Q> —Again, in the 12th chapter, the same reason is clearly assigned for the pouring out of God's Vengeance:— <Q>Say unto the People of the Land, Thus saith the Lord God of the Inhabitants of Jerusalem and of the Land of Israel; They shall eat their Bread with Care∣fulness; and drink their Water with Astonishment, that her Land may be desolate from all that is therein, <HI>be∣cause of</HI> THE VIOLENCE <HI>of them that dwell therein.</HI></Q> Ezek. xii. 19. The nature of this baneful <HI>Violence,</HI> which oc∣casioned their <HI>destruction,</HI> is more parti∣cularly
<PB N="33" REF="36"/>described by the same Prophet, in chap. xxii. ver. 7.— <Q><HI>in the midst of thee</HI></Q> (still speaking of Jerusalem) <Q>have they dealt by <HI>Oppression</HI> with <HI>the Stranger</HI></Q> (mark this, ye British Slave-dealers and Slave-holders); <Q>in thee have they vexed the Fatherless and the Widow. Thou hast de∣spised mine holy things, and hast pro∣faned my Sabbaths. In thee are men that carry tales to shed Blood: and in thee they eat upon the mountains: in the midst of thee they commit lewdness,</Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI>— <Q>One hath com∣mitted abomination with his Neigh∣bour's Wife: and another hath lewdly defiled his Daughter-in-law,</Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI>— <Q>In thee have they taken <HI>gifts to shed Blood:</HI> thou hast taken Usury and Increase, and thou hast greedily gained of thy Neighbours by Extor∣tion, and hast forgotten me, saith the Lord God. Behold, <HI>therefore,</HI> I have
<PB N="34" REF="37"/>smitten mine hand at thy dishonest gain which thou hast made, and at thy Blood which hath been in the midst of thee,</Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Ezek. xxii. 7, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Oh that the Subjects of the British Empire would seriously compare these crimes with their own practices! they would then, surely, be sensible of their danger; and that they have reason to expect the like, or rather much heavier, Judgements, than those denounced against the Jews! For, besides the no∣torious <HI>Adulteries,</HI> and other acts of <HI>Lewdness,</HI> which many amongst us (from the frequency of such crimes) commit, even without shame or re∣morse, we have far exceeded the guilt of the Jews, I fear, in many of the other points also which provoked the Vengeance of the Almighty against them! What <HI>"Violence"</HI> amongst the Jews, before their Captivity, was ever
<PB N="35" REF="38"/><HI>"risen up into"</HI> so destructive <Q><HI>a Rod of Wickedness</HI></Q>—as the AFRICAN SLAVE-TRADE, now carried on chiefly by our <HI>Liverpool</HI> and <HI>Bristol</HI> Mer∣chants? What <HI>"bloody crime"</HI> among the Jews was more notorious, and more wickedly premeditated, than the late <HI>In∣vasion</HI> and <HI>Conquest</HI> of the poor innocent CARRIBEES at ST. VINCENT's? And what Nation hath <Q><HI>dealt by Oppres∣sion with the Stranger</HI></Q> so generally, so inhumanly, and in so great a degree, as our BRITISH AMERICAN SLAVE-HOLDERS!—Have we not ample rea∣son to expect that the same tremendous decree will, in God's Justice, be ful∣filled upon these Kingdoms?— <Q><HI>De∣struction</HI> cometh: and they shall seek Peace, and there shall be none. Mis∣chief shall come upon mischief, and rumour upon rumour,</Q> <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</HI>— <Q>I will do unto them after <HI>their</HI> (own) <HI>way,</HI> and according to <HI>their</HI>
<PB N="36" REF="39"/>(own) <HI>Judgements</HI> will I judge them!</Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Nevertheless, God was pleased to offer the Jews a Choice in <HI>their Fate,</HI>—either to forsake their wicked King (who had forfeited all right to govern, by his neg∣lect of <HI>Justice</HI> and <HI>Natural Right</HI>) and to fall away to the King's Enemies, the Chaldeans; or else to perish miserably in the City, and partake of it's Destruc∣tion!—"And unto this People" (said God to the Prophet Jeremiah) <Q>thou shalt say, Thus saith the Lord; Be∣hold, I set before you the way of <HI>Life,</HI> and the way of <HI>Death.</HI> He that abideth in this City shall die by the Sword, and by the Famine, and by the Pestilence: but he <HI>that goeth out, and falleth to the Chaldeans that besiege you, he shall live, and his Life shall be unto him for a Prey,</HI></Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Jer. xxi. 8, 9.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="40"/>The Prophet, however, was directed to add to his message a word of advice to the <HI>King</HI> and <HI>Court,</HI> which shews that a seasonable repentance might, even then, have saved the State, and turned away the impending <HI>Vengeance.</HI></P>
<P>It was such advice, too, as every other Monarch, who tolerates any <HI>unnatural Bondage</HI> or <HI>Oppression</HI> in his Dominions, ought seriously to consider, because the event proved it to be the best means of averting God's Anger, if the King had but persevered in it.— <Q>And touching <HI>the House of the King of Judah</HI></Q> (con∣tinued the Prophet) <Q>say,—Hear ye the Word of the Lord, O House of David—thus saith the Lord; <HI>Exe∣cute Judgement</HI> in the morning, and <HI>deliver him that is spoiled</HI> out of the hand of the <HI>Oppressor,</HI> lest my Fury go out like Fire, and burn that none can quench <HI>(it),</HI> because of the evil
<PB N="38" REF="41"/>of your doings.</Q> Jer. xxi. 12. This is a manifest declaration that <HI>the Neglect of</HI> JUSTICE <HI>and</HI> RIGHT, and <HI>the Tolera∣tion of</HI> OPPRESSION, were the principal causes of God's heavy Vengeance against <HI>that Royal House!</HI></P>
<P>The same advice was, by God's Com∣mand, repeated by the Prophet to <HI>the King himself</HI> IN HIS PALACE (see the next chapter):— <Q>Thus saith the Lord; Go down to THE HOUSE of the King of Judah, <HI>and speak</HI> THERE <HI>this word,</HI> and say, Hear the word of the Lord, <HI>O King of Judah,</HI> that fittest <HI>upon the Throne of David,</HI> thou, and thy Ser∣vants, and thy People that enter in by these Gates" (that is, all Persons what∣ever that <HI>enter in by</HI></Q> <HI>the Palace-gates,</HI> plainly including <HI>the whole Court,</HI> be∣fore whom the Prophet was to deliver his message): <Q>Thus saith the Lord; <HI>Execute</HI> ye JUDGEMENT and RIGH∣TEOUSNESS,
<PB N="39" REF="42"/>and <HI>deliver the Spoiled out of the hand of</HI> THE OPPRES∣SOR; and do no wrong, DO NO VIOLENCE TO THE STRAN∣GER <NOTE N="(13)" PLACE="foot"><P>And what <HI>"Wrong"</HI> or <Q><HI>Violence to the Stran∣ger</HI></Q> can be more <HI>oppressive</HI> than that of detaining him in an <HI>involuntary Servitude,</HI> WITHOUT WAGES, in a miserable, wretched <HI>Bondage,</HI> worse than that of <HI>brute Beasts!</HI></P></NOTE></Q>, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> — <Q>For if ye do this thing indeed</Q> (that is, if ye will <HI>execute Judgement and Righteousness, deli∣ver the Oppressed, &amp;c.</HI>) <Q>then shall there enter in <HI>by the Gates of this House</HI> Kings sitting upon the Throne of David</Q> (or rather "that sit," <HI>i. e.</HI> reign, "for David upon his Throne") <Q>riding in Chariots and on Horses, he and his Servants, and his People</Q> (that is, the Court should continue and prosper). <Q>But if ye will not hear THESE WORDS, <HI>I swear by my∣self, saith the Lord</HI></Q> (<HI>i. e.</HI> Jehovah)
<PB N="40" REF="43"/>"that THIS HOUSE" (<HI>i. e.</HI> the Palace) "shall become a desolation." Jer. xxii. 1 to 5. So that <HI>the whole Court</HI> were as much interested to promote a speedy Reformation, as <HI>the King himself.</HI> Thus it is plain that <HI>the King and Court</HI> had also a Choice given them of <HI>Life</HI> and <HI>Death,</HI> as well as the People; and, con∣sequently, that the Judgements de∣nounced were only <HI>conditional,</HI> in case the warning was neglected; for it is manifest that God mercifully tendered to them <HI>(even at the eve of their destruc∣tion)</HI> a continuance of the Monarchy <HI>(viz. <Q>Kings sitting upon the Throne of David</Q>)</HI> if they would but resolve to <Q><HI>execute</HI> JUDGEMENT <HI>and</HI> RIGHTE∣OUSNESS;</Q> to <Q><HI>deliver the Spoiled out of the hand of the</HI> OPPRESSOR;</Q> and to <Q><HI>do no Wrong,</HI> NO VIOLENCE, <HI>to</HI> THE STRANGER,</Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But the Prophet also added much more <HI>advice</HI> to <HI>the King and his Court,</HI> though he was
<PB N="41" REF="44"/>not "<HI>made of the King's Council</HI> <NOTE N="(14)" PLACE="foot"><P>When a similar warning was given by a for∣mer Prophet to a wicked and inconsiderate Predecessor of <HI>Zedekiah,</HI> concerning <HI>God's impending Vengeance</HI> for his misconduct, the haughty Monarch, puffed up with vain notions of his Royal Importance, arrogantly im∣posed silence on the Prophet, because he had under∣taken the office of <HI>an Adviser</HI> or <HI>Counsellor</HI> to the King without <HI>the etiquette</HI> or formality of a Court Appoint∣ment: —<HI>"Art thou made of the King's Council?"</HI> (said the Monarch:) <Q>forbear; why shouldest thou <HI>be smit∣ten?</HI></Q> —Upon which the Prophet <HI>forbore</HI> indeed <HI>to reason with him;</HI> but immediately pronounced upon him the severe sentence of God's Condemnation, say∣ing, <Q>I know that God hath determined to destroy thee, because thou hast done this, and hast not hearkened unto <HI>my Counsel:</HI></Q> and it is remarkable, that, after <HI>rejecting the Counsel</HI> of God, the <HI>very next Counsel</HI> which this imperious Monarch was pleased to adopt was attended with the most dangerous and humiliating consequences, <HI>both to King and Kingdom,</HI> that could possibly have happened! nothing less than the delivery of both into the absolute power of their Enemies! for after he had <HI>silenced</HI> the Prophet, "then" (says the Text) <Q>Amaziah King of Judah TOOK ADVICE, and sent to Joash, the Son of Jehoahaz, the Son of Jehu, King of Israel, saying, Come, let us see one another in the face.</Q>—The war was <HI>unjust</HI> and <HI>unreasonable;</HI> and, providentially, the King and his <HI>wicked Advisers</HI> were punished by the effects of their own <HI>unprincipled Counsel.</HI> See 2 Chron. xxv. 16—24.</P></NOTE>;" for he boldly warned the Monarch by the tremendous examples of God's Judgements upon three of his imme∣diate Predecessors in the Kingdom; two of whom were <HI>his own Brothers,</HI> the
<PB N="42" REF="45"/>Sons of King Josiah; and the third <HI>his own Nephew,</HI> whom he immediately succeeded. They were all particularly mentioned by him in the proper order of their respective reigns, as we find by the copy of his Message or Remon∣strance, preserved in the Collection of his Prophecies; and, throughout the said Remonstrance, frequent allusions are made to the principal causes of the failure and destruction of each of them, which afford a most striking and inte∣resting Lesson to Kings and Governors <HI>in general;</HI> but it must have been <HI>more particularly</HI> affecting to Zedekiah, if we consider his critical situation at the
<PB N="43" REF="46"/>time the Message was delivered to him, and that the Examples of <HI>Vengeance,</HI> to which the Prophet referred him, were <HI>actually accomplished</HI> in the Persons of his <HI>nearest Relations</HI> and <HI>Predecessors,</HI> who were successively <HI>deprived of their Royal Dignity,</HI> and carried away IN CHAINS into a <HI>slavish Captivity;</HI> the very fate which, the Prophet assured him, was to be his own!</P>
<P>But before I recite the remainder of God's Message to <HI>the Court of Zedekiah,</HI> it will be necessary for me to give some general account of that Monarch and of his immediate Predecessors, in order that the Remonstrance, in which they are all distinctly mentioned, may be more easily understood by the generality of Readers. It will likewise be ne∣cessary for me to prove, that the whole 22d Chapter of Jeremiah is included in that <HI>Message,</HI> or <HI>Remonstrance,</HI> which
<PB N="44" REF="47"/>the Prophet was then to deliver in the presence of the <HI>whole Court</HI> of Zede∣kiah. And I propose to insert also some remarks, as they occur, concerning the Prophet himself, and the order of time, in which he delivered the several tre∣mendous predictions of GOD's <HI>Vengeance</HI> against these wicked Princes.</P>
<P>Zedekiah was the Son of that excel∣lent Prince Josiah King of Judah, on whose account, expressly, <HI>the dreadful Vengeance,</HI> due to that wicked Nation, was postponed for several years, <HI>viz.</HI> till after his death.</P>
<P>The Scriptures mention four Sons of King Josiah, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q>the first-born, Jo∣hanan (or John); the second, Je∣hoiakim; the third, Zedekiah; and the fourth, Shallum.</Q> 1 Chron. iii. 15.—What became of the eldest Son
<PB N="45" REF="48"/>Johanan, or John, is not recorded<NOTE N="(15)" PLACE="foot"><P>—"this <HI>Johanan</HI>" (says Bishop Patrick) <Q>is thought by many to be the same with <HI>Jehoahaz,</HI> who succeeded <HI>Josiah</HI> in the Throne. But he</Q> (mean∣ing <HI>Jehoahaz</HI>) <Q>was not his first-born, being but twenty-three years old when the People made him King; and after three months time his Brother, being put in his place, is said to be twenty-five years old. 2 Kings xxiii. 31, 36. Petavius</Q> (con∣tinues the Bishop) <Q>hath said a great deal about this, in his Annotations upon Epiphanius ad Haeres. Epicur. p. 18. But after all</Q> (says the learned Bishop) <Q><HI>I take the truth to be, that</HI> JOHANAN WAS HIS ELDEST SON, <HI>but died before his Father:</HI> and therefore is not mentioned in the Book of Kings; as</Q> (continues he) <Q><HI>Jehoahaz</HI> is not men∣tioned here, being made King by the People of the Land, and presently dethroned.</Q>—In the latter part of this remark, however, the worthy Bishop is appa∣rently mistaken; for the same King, who was some∣times called <HI>Jehoahaz,</HI> is certainly <HI>mentioned</HI> in that very Text (1 Chron. iii. 15.) on which the Bishop made this remark, though mentioned, indeed, under a different name, <HI>viz. Shallum.</HI></P></NOTE>, but all the others ascended the Throne of David; and first of all, the youngest Son <HI>Shallum,</HI> whom, on the death of King Josiah, <Q><HI>the People of the Land took,</HI> and</Q> (as it seems, without) re∣gard
<PB N="46" REF="49"/>to seniority) <Q>made him King in his Father's stead in Jerusalem.</Q> 2 Chron. xxxvi. 1.<NOTE N="(16)" PLACE="foot"><P>In this Text <HI>Shallum</HI> is called <HI>Jehoahaz,</HI> which, perhaps, was his original or proper name, and the other name, <HI>Shallum,</HI> only a surname (signifying <HI>Peace</HI>), given him, probably, by the People at his Corona∣tion, and in remembrance of <HI>the peace</HI> and general tranquillity during the greatest part of his Father's reign: but the great and learned Archbishop Usher just reversed this supposition; for he was of opinion, that <HI>Shallum</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>— <Q>Eum enim 23 annos natum, <HI>senioribus Fratribus post∣habitis,</HI> Populus Regem Patris loco constituit.

<P>Nevertheless, in defence of what I have ventured to mention as my own opinion, I must remark, that in the list of King <HI>Josiah</HI>'s Sons, where <HI>Shallum</HI> is men∣tioned with the rest of his Brothers (<HI>viz.</HI> 1 Chron. iii. 15.) no less than <HI>two</HI> of his Brothers out of <HI>three</HI> are mentioned only by THE SURNAMES <HI>which were given them when they began to reign;</HI> and the <HI>third</HI> Brother there mentioned (or rather the <HI>first</HI> of them, Johanan) <HI>never reigned;</HI> and therefore, probably, had no <HI>surname</HI> to distinguish him, like the rest: but the other two, who actually ascended the Throne of Da∣vid, were mentioned by their <HI>surnames only, viz.</HI> JE∣HOIAKIM (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>Jehov-ikim,</HI> signifying <HI>Jeho∣vah will establish</HI>) and ZEDEKIAH (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>Tsadok-Jehov,</HI> signifying <HI>the Righteousness of Jehovah</HI>); for their <HI>proper names</HI> were <HI>Eliakim</HI> (2 Kings xxiii. 34.) and <HI>Mattaniah</HI> (2 Kings xxiv. 17.): and therefore it is very natural to conclude, that the name of the <HI>only remaining Brother, who actually reigned,</HI> and is men∣tioned in the same Text (<HI>viz. Shallum,</HI> signifying <HI>Peace</HI>) is likewise <HI>a surname,</HI> as well as the other two mentioned before him, who received the names, by which they are distinguished in that Text, when they were first appointed to the Throne of Judah.</P></NOTE>.</P>

Jerem. 30.</Q> See on 2 Kings xxiv. 6.</P>
<P>The worthy Prelate is certainly right concerning the expression <HI>"to sleep with one's Fathers;"</HI> for that is always mentioned as a distinct thing from <HI>the burial</HI> of any one: as for instance— <Q>AHAZ SLEPT WITH HIS FATHERS, <HI>and they</HI> BURIED <HI>him in the City,</HI> (even) <HI>in Jerusalem; but they</HI> BROUGHT HIM NOT <HI>into the Sepulchres of</HI> THE KINGS OF ISRAEL:</Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> (2 Chron. xxviii. 27.) whereby the distinction above∣mentioned is rendered manifest. It was the common method, it seems, of expressing the <HI>death</HI> (not the <HI>bu∣rial</HI>) of Princes among the Eastern Nations; and even in <HI>Morocco,</HI> where many Eastern Customs prevail, it is necessary, even to this day, to use some circumlocu∣tion in expressing the <HI>death</HI> of any one, as it would be esteemed a capital offence to say in the Emperor's pre∣sence, <HI>in direct terms,</HI> that any man was <HI>dead.</HI> This I have been informed by a worthy friend of mine, who has frequently conversed with the present Emperor of Morocco.</P>
<P>But with respect to the <HI>manner</HI> of JEHOIAKIM'S <HI>death</HI> I must remark, that neither the opinion of the learned Bishop <HI>Patrick,</HI> quoted above, nor what he has cited from <HI>Abarbinel</HI> (<HI>viz.</HI> that <HI>"he died in the way"</HI>) seem to agree with the most probable account of <HI>God's Ven∣geance</HI> upon that wicked Monarch.</P></NOTE>, and that JEHOIA∣CHIN

<P>This second conquest of Jehoiakim by Nebuchadnezzar was the sixth (if not the seventh) time that <HI>Jerusalem</HI> was taken by <HI>foreign Enemies</HI> since the conditional promise was made to David concerning <HI>the Establishment of his Throne;</HI> and the Exaltation of <HI>Jehoiachin,</HI> by the

<P>The 50th and 51st chapters of Jere∣miah seem to come next in order of time. They contain dreadful denunci∣ations of <HI>God's Vengeance and Retribution</HI> against <HI>Babylon,</HI> the mighty Instrument of <HI>God's Vengeance</HI> (of which I shall have occasion to say more hereafter).
<PB N="119" REF="122"/>In the 51st chapter (ver. 60.) we read, that <Q>JEREMIAH <HI>wrote in a book all the evil that should come upon</HI> BABY∣LON, <HI>even all these words that are written against Babylon;</HI></Q> which, of course, must include <HI>both chapters:</HI> and we are enabled to ascertain the date of them by the preceding verse; which (together with the following verses) in∣forms us, that the Prince Seraiah was directed to read the said Prophecies at Babylon, when he went there with ZE∣DEKIAH <HI>in the fourth year of his reign,</HI> and was afterwards to cast the Book into the midst of the River <HI>Euphrates.</HI> Jer. li. 59—64.</P>
<P>There is no particular mention in Scripture of any transactions of <HI>Zedekiah</HI> between the fourth and ninth years of his reign; only that <Q><HI>he rebelled against the King of Babylon in sending Ambas∣sadors into Egypt, that they might give

<PB N="121" REF="124"/>of which his new name (Zedekiah, or <HI>Righteousness of Jehovah</HI>) was certainly intended to remind him. This wicked policy was censured in the severest terms by the Prophet Ezekiel: — <Q><HI>Shall he prosper?</HI></Q> (said the Prophet) <Q>shall he escape that doth such (things)? or shall he break the Covenant, and be delivered? As I live, saith the LORD GOD, surely in the place <HI>(where)</HI> the King <HI>(dwelleth)</HI> that made him King, whose Oath he despised, and whose Covenant he brake, <HI>(even)</HI> with him, in the midst of Babylon, he

Thus Zedekiah's Fate was appointed to be one of the many proofs which God vouchsafed to the Jews, to demonstrate the Truth of his Revela∣tion by the Prophets.</P>
<P>In the ninth year of Zedekiah the impending Vengeance became visible by the near approach of the Babylonian Army, as I have before remarked in page 28: for then began to be fulfilled what had been foretold not only in the fourth year of <HI>Jehoiakim,</HI> but, probably,
<PB N="124" REF="127"/>also in the reign of Josiah. Compare Jer. i. 15. with xxv. 9. In the former, God declares,— <Q><HI>I will call all the Fa∣milies of the Kingdoms of the North,</HI></Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and in the latter, <Q>Behold, <HI>I will send and take all the Families of the North,</HI> saith the Lord</Q> (thereby marking his absolute direction of them), <Q>and Nebuchadrezzar the King of Babylon MY SERVANT, and will bring them <HI>against this Land,</HI></Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>And accordingly, after Nebuchad∣nezzar had strengthened his Empire, by reducing to his obedience all the King∣doms of the <HI>Assyrian</HI> as well as the <HI>Syrian</HI> Dominion (which latter lay to <HI>the North</HI> of Judaea, and extended quite up to <HI>Armenia,</HI> the <HI>Armenians</HI> themselves being no other than <HI>Syrians;</HI> for <HI>Aram</HI> is the proper name in Scripture for <HI>Syria</HI>), he compelled the conquered Nations to assist him in reducing others to a like
<PB N="125" REF="128"/>servile subjection under his own arbitrary <HI>Will,</HI> without perceiving that he and they, <HI>collectively,</HI> were but a mere in∣strument of <HI>Vengeance</HI> <NOTE N="(86)" PLACE="foot"><P><Q><HI>And thus was</HI> NEBUCHADNEZZAR <HI>raised up by God, to be a</HI> SCOURGE</Q> (compare this with what I have already remarked concerning that Monarch in pages 67, 68, 83, and 84) <Q>TO ALL THE NATIONS ABOUT HIM, <HI>for the Punishment of their Sins.</HI> NE∣BUCHADNEZZAR had, indeed, OTHER THINGS IN HIS HEAD.

<PB N="126" REF="129"/><Q><HI>all his Army, and all the Kingdoms of the Earth of his Dominion,</HI></Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I have already related the Message which <HI>Zedekiah</HI> sent to the Prophet Jeremiah on this occasion, with the Prophet's Answer, which is the subject of the 21st chapter; and that the Prophet was di∣rected also to repeat the Subject of that Answer in the presence of <HI>Zedekiah</HI> and <HI>his whole Court;</HI> which leads me once more to the consideration of the 22d chapter, the difficulty of which had obliged me to go back, and investigate the Histories of the preceding Princes of Judah, and of the Times when the se∣veral Prophecies against them by <HI>Jere∣miah</HI> were revealed: and though this necessary digression has, I fear, been extended to a much greater length than is consistent with due order and method, yet, I trust, my candid Readers will excuse this defect in mere matter of form, if they should find any thing in
<PB N="127" REF="130"/>my digression that may tend to illus∣trate, and render more familiar to the generality of Readers, that excellent Book, the Collection of <HI>Jeremiah</HI>'s Pro∣phecies, in which all Mankind are ma∣terially concerned and interested: for the Certainty of <HI>God's Vengeance</HI> upon <HI>wicked Nations</HI> is unquestionably demon∣strated in the Prophecies of <HI>Jeremiah;</HI> so that the Tenour of <HI>that whole Book,</HI> indeed, relates, in some degree, to my present subject, though I had at first intended to confine myself, in this Tract, to the examination only of the 21st, 22d, and 34th chapters, as being more particularly levelled against <HI>Oppressors, Tyrants,</HI> and <HI>Slave-holders!</HI></P>
<P>Commentators have generally con∣ceived, that the Divine Message, re∣corded in the 22d chapter (from the be∣ginning to the 19th verse at least), was not delivered to <HI>Zedekiah,</HI> but to <HI>Jehoi∣akim,</HI>
<PB N="128" REF="131"/>because a Prophecy against the latter is recorded in the 18th verse, <HI>viz.</HI> "Therefore" (said the Prophet, refer∣ring back to the Offences before-men∣tioned) <Q><HI>thus saith the Lord,</HI> CONCERN∣ING JEHOIAKIM, <HI>the Son of Josiah, King of Judah; They shall not lament for him, saying, Ah, my Brother!</HI></Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> <Q><HI>He shall be buried with the burial of an Ass,</HI></Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>But if we carefully examine the whole chapter, with reference to the chapter which precedes, as well as that which follows, it will be found much more intelligible, coherent, and striking, when the whole is considered as one conti∣nued Address to <HI>Zedekiah,</HI> reminding him of the Judgements denounced (and then, indeed, fulfilled) against his im∣mediate Predecessors, exactly according to the order of their reigns, and ex∣pressly for the same Offences (<HI>viz.</HI> OP∣PRESSION,
<PB N="129" REF="132"/>and <HI>the Neglect of</HI> JUSTICE <HI>and</HI> RIGHT) for which he himself, <HI>by name,</HI> is condemned in the 21st chap∣ter. The only difficulty which attends this construction is occasioned by the English Translators having used the <HI>pre∣sent tense,</HI> in the 11th, 18th, and 24th verses (where the <HI>praeter tense</HI> would certainly have been much more proper); <HI>viz.</HI> "Thus <HI>saith</HI> the Lord," instead of <Q>Thus <HI>said</HI> the Lord to, or concern∣ing, <HI>Jehoiakim,</HI></Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which latter is the literal construction of the original, and is always so expressed in the inter∣lineary Latin Version of the London Polyglot, <HI>viz. "Sic dixit Dominus:"</HI> for though in many other places it is indif∣ferent to the sense, whether the <HI>present</HI> or <HI>praeter tense</HI> is used, yet in these above-mentioned it makes a very material dif∣ference; because the Prophet is only re∣minding Zedekiah of the Prophecies which he had before denounced (or, at
<PB N="130" REF="133"/>least, to the same effect) against his dis∣obedient Predecessors; as that, for in∣stance, against <HI>Jehoiakim</HI> was first deli∣vered by Baruch the Scribe (though not exactly in the same words, yet surely to the same purport) in the presence of <HI>Jehoiakim</HI> himself, after he had burnt the Roll of <HI>Jeremiah</HI>'s Prophecies, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q><HI>His dead Body shall be cast out in the Day to the Heat, and in the Night to the Frost;</HI></Q> (Jer. xxxvi. 30.) which is the same thing, in effect, as to <Q><HI>be buried with the burial of an Ass, drawn and cast forth</HI> <NOTE N="(87)" PLACE="foot"><P><Q><HI>Jehoiakimus,</HI> à Chaldaeis captus, abjectus fuit <HI>insepultus:</HI> nempè <HI>sepulturâ Asini sepultus,</HI> tractus &amp; projectus ultra portas Hierosolymorum; juxta Prophetiam Jerem. xxii. 18, 19. &amp; xxxvi. 30. licèt, ad communem Naturae Legem respectu habito, dor∣mivisse dicatur ille cum Patribus suis. 2 Reg. xxiv. 6.</Q> Ad A.

<PB N="132" REF="135"/>by <HI>Pharaoh-Necho;</HI> and the <HI>Bur∣then</HI> of the Prophecy against him was, that "<HI>he shall return no more," &amp;c.</HI> See the endings of all the three verses where∣in he is mentioned, <HI>viz.</HI> 10, 11, and 12, which all <HI>end with that Burthen.</HI> Again, it is not likely that <HI>Jehoiakim</HI> (who is mentioned next in order) was <HI>then the reigning Prince,</HI> because his Son and Successor <HI>Jehoiachin</HI> (alias <HI>Coniah,</HI> or <HI>Jeconiah</HI>) is mentioned in the conti∣nuance of the fame Declaration, in a much more conspicuous light than <HI>Je∣hoiakim</HI> himself, being addressed in the second person, as if present at the time of the Denunciation, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q><HI>I will give</HI> THEE <HI>into the hand of them that seek</HI> THY <HI>Life,</HI></Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> <Q><HI>And I will cast</HI> THEE <HI>out,</HI></Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>And though <HI>Jehoiachin,</HI> probably, was the reigning <HI>Prince</HI> upon the Throne, when this severe Prophecy
<PB N="133" REF="136"/>against him was <HI>first of all</HI> denounced; and also though he is expressly spoken of, in the 28th verse, as present, <HI>viz. "This Man</HI> CONIAH;" yet he was not the Prince that <HI>sat</HI> <Q><HI>upon the Throne of David,</HI></Q> when Jeremiah repeated (as I conceive) <HI>these several Prophecies,</HI> men∣tioned in the 22d chapter; because the Prophet, after a most solemn and alarm∣ing exclamation (<Q>O EARTH, EARTH, EARTH, <HI>hear the Word of the Lord!</HI></Q>) concludes his Message with a dreadful Sentence against a Prince whom he also calls <HI>"this Man,"</HI> as if present (<HI>viz. "Write ye</HI> THIS MAN <HI>childless</HI>"), which by no means agrees with the case either of <HI>Jehoiakim</HI> or <HI>Coniah.</HI> The former cer∣tainly <HI>was not childless;</HI> for, besides his Son <HI>Jehoiachin,</HI> or <HI>Coniah,</HI> it is not im∣probable but that <Q><HI>Daniel and his fel∣lows</HI></Q> (or, at least, some of them) were also <HI>the Children of</HI> JEHOIAKIM; for they were <Q>OF THE KING'S SEED,
<PB N="134" REF="137"/>AND OF THE PRINCES</Q> (Dan. i. 3.) that were carried to Babylon in the third year (or rather the fourth year) of <HI>Jehoiakim,</HI> when that Monarch was twenty-eight or twenty-nine years of age. And it is as certain that <HI>Coniah,</HI> or <HI>Jehoiachin,</HI> was not <HI>childless,</HI> because express mention is made of his <HI>Seed</HI> (or Children) in the 28th verse of this 22d chapter, <HI>viz.</HI> that <Q><HI>he and his</HI> SEED <HI>are cast into a Land that they know not;</HI></Q> and no less than eight Sons of his are expressly mentioned in 1 Chron. iii. 17, 18.<NOTE N="(88)" PLACE="foot"><P>"<HI>The Sons of</HI> JECONIAH" (the same with Co∣niah) <Q><HI>Assir, Salathiel his Son, Malchiram</HI> also, and <HI>Pedaiah,</HI> and <HI>Shenazar, Jecamiah, Hoshama,</HI> and <HI>Nedabiah.</HI></Q> 1 Chron. iii. 17, 18.</P></NOTE>.

<PB N="135" REF="138"/>LOSING his Children <HI>during his Capti∣vity,</HI> that it is probable <HI>they were most of them born during the Captivity;</HI> for he was but <Q>eighteen years of age when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem</Q> (ONLY) <HI>"three months"</HI> (2 Kings xxiv. 8.) <HI>"and ten days"</HI> (2 Chron. xxxvi. 9.): so that it is not easy to conceive, that he could have so many as eight Children <HI>before he was carried to Babylon.</HI> But the matter is put out of dispute by the Apostle MAT∣THEW, who informs us <HI>expressly,</HI> that <Q>AFTER <HI>they were brought to Babylon,</HI> JECHONIAS BEGAT <HI>Salathiel; and Salathiel begat Zorobabel;</HI></Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Mat. i. 12. from whence a regular succession is continued for more than five hundred years, down to <HI>Joseph</HI> the <HI>Hushand</HI> of the Blessed Virgin.

And accordingly the Scriptures hear a remarkable testimony concerning <Q>THE GOOD</Q> which God reserved for <HI>Jehoiachin</HI> <Q>IN THE LAND OF THE CHALDAEANS.</Q> So that he must necessarily be said to have <HI>"prospered in his days;"</HI> for we read expressly, that <Q>EVIL-MERODACH <HI>King of Babylon, in the</HI> (first) <HI>year of his reign, lifted up the head of</HI> JEHOIACHIN <HI>King of Judah, and brought him out of prison, and spake kindly unto him, and</HI> SET
<PB N="139" REF="142"/>HIS THRONE ABOVE THE THRONE OF THE KINGS THAT <HI>(were)</HI> WITH HIM IN BABYLON</Q> (so that of him, who was thus set up, as in the highest place of favour, upon a Throne, in the presence of the most powerful King at that time upon earth, it could not he said, that <HI>"he did not prosper in his days,"</HI> espe∣cially as this extraordinary favour and <HI>prosperity</HI> lasted <HI>all his days;</HI> for we read in the Text, that) <Q><HI>he did</HI> CONTINUALLY <HI>eat bread before him</HI></Q> (the Baby∣lonian Monarch) <Q>ALL THE DAYS OF HIS LIFE. <HI>And</HI> (for) <HI>his diet, there was a</HI> CONTINUAL DIET <HI>given him of the King of Babylon, every day a portion,</HI> UNTIL THE DAY OF HIS DEATH, ALL THE DAYS OF HIS LIFE.</Q> Jer. lii. 31—34.</P>
<P>Surely, therefore, it would be as improper to say of <HI>this Man</HI> JEHOIACHIN (who had so great a share of PROSPERITY), that <Q><HI>he did not prosper in his days,</HI></Q> as to "<HI>write him</HI> CHILDLESS," who had so many CHILDREN, and so long and compleat a succes∣sion of Descendants, some of whom, as <HI>Salathiel</HI> and <HI>Zorobabel,</HI> were RULERS IN JUDAH, though they <HI>did not</HI> "SIT UPON THE THRONE OF DAVID!" The Prophecy, therefore, of these unhappy circumstances, <HI>the Deprivation of Children,</HI> and <HI>Want of Prosperity,</HI> in the 22d chapter, could not by any means relate to <HI>Je∣hoiachin</HI> or <HI>his Descendants;</HI> and there was no other Monarch after him <HI>"upon the Throne of David"</HI> to whom it could be applied, <HI>except</HI> ZEDEKIAH <HI>alone.</HI></P>

</TEXT></Q>
<P>The Prophet afterwards proceeds (in the 5th, 6th, and 7th verses of his Remonstrance to the King and Court) to declare the certainty of Desolation and <HI>Vengeance,</HI> if they would not hear his words; and in the 8th and 9th verses he assigns a general Reason<NOTE N="(92)" PLACE="foot"><P><Q><HI>And many Nations shall pass by this City, and they shall say every man to his neighbour, Wherefore hath the</HI> LORD <HI>done thus unto this great City? Then they shall answer, Because they have forsaken the Cove∣nant of the</HI> LORD <HI>their</HI> GOD, <HI>and worshipped other Gods, and served them.</HI></Q> Jer. xxii. 8, 9. Now, probably, <HI>the British Slave-dealer and British American Slave-holder</HI> will be apt to argue from thence, that the several examples of God's Vengeance upon the Jews, which I have cited in this Tract, have no rela∣tion
<PB N="143" REF="146"/>to the subject of difference between them and me. We have not <HI>"worshipped other Gods, and served them"</HI> (perhaps they will say); so that the account of <HI>God's Vengeance</HI> against <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> which Granville Sharp has cited as a warning against <HI>Slave-dealing</HI> and <HI>Slave-holding,</HI> is not at all applicable to us!—But let me (as a Friend and Countryman) warn all such persons, that they have really <Q><HI>worshipped other Gods, and served them,</HI></Q> and have <HI>broken the Christian Covenant</HI> in as notorious and impious a manner as ever the an∣cient <HI>Jews</HI> did the Covenant of Sinai! Respecting <HI>the Breach of Covenant</HI> I have wrote at large in another Tract now in the Press; and shall therefore only offer, at present, a few hints respecting the horrid crime of <HI>serving other Gods.</HI></P>
<P>Christ himself has taught us, that <Q>NO MAN CAN SERVE TWO MASTERS: <HI>for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other:</HI></Q> and then he immediately adds, <HI>"Ye cannot serve</HI> GOD <HI>and Mammon."</HI> Mat. vi. 24. and Luke xvi. 13. Here the <HI>Service of Mammon</HI> is placed in as direct opposition to the <HI>Service of</HI> GOD, as ever was the Service of <HI>Baal, Moloch,</HI> or <HI>Chemosh;</HI> though the first means not any particular <HI>Idol,</HI> but only the baneful influence of <HI>Riches,</HI> or the undue preva∣lence of <HI>private interest</HI> over all sense of Religion, Jus∣tice, and Virtue! In like manner <HI>Covetousness</HI> (which
<PB N="144" REF="147"/>includes all that I have said of <HI>Mammon</HI>) is frequently mentioned in Scripture as downright <HI>Idolatry:</HI> <Q><HI>For this ye know</HI></Q> (said the Apostle Paul to the Ephesians, chap. v. 5.), <Q><HI>that no Whoremonger,</HI> nor <HI>unclean per∣son,</HI> nor COVETOUS MAN, WHO IS AN IDO∣LATER, <HI>hath any Inheritance in the Kingdom of Christ and of God.</HI></Q> And in the Epistle to the Co∣lossians the same Apostle warns us against some of the common Vices which draw down the Wrath of God, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q><HI>Fornication, Uncleanness, inordinate Affection, evil Concupiscence,</HI> and COVETOUSNESS, <HI>which is</HI> IDOLATRY.</Q> Col. iii. 5.</P>
<P>Neither is <HI>Covetousness</HI> the only Vice that is deemed <HI>Idolatry</HI>—all the other Lusts and carnal Indulgences are equally ranked with <HI>Idolatry:</HI> so that those in∣considerate persons, who yield to any of them, may as aptly be said to <HI>"serve other Gods,"</HI> as those back∣sliding Professors of Christianity at <HI>Philippi,</HI> whom the Apostle Paul expressly charged with this kind of <HI>Idolatry, viz. "whose God is their Belly:"</HI>— <Q><HI>For many walk</HI></Q> (says he) <Q><HI>of whom I have told you often, and now tell you, even weeping,</HI> (that they are) <HI>the</HI> ENEMIES <HI>of the Cross of</HI> CHRIST: <HI>whose end</HI> (is) <HI>Destruction,</HI> WHOSE GOD (is their) BELLY, <HI>and</HI> (whose) <HI>Glory</HI> (is) <HI>in their Shame, who mind earthly things.</HI></Q> Philip. iii. 18, 19. And the <HI>Service of
<PB N="145" REF="148"/>the Belly</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Even the Schismatical Teachers of Novel Doctrines are rank∣ed with those <HI>Idolaters</HI> who <Q><HI>serve their own Belly,</HI> and serve not God.</Q>— <Q><HI>For they that are such</HI> SERVE NOT <HI>our Lord</HI> JESUS CHRIST, <HI>but</HI> THEIR OWN BELLY; <HI>and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple.</HI></Q> Rom. xvi. 18.</P></NOTE>, is placed in as direct opposition to <HI>the Ser∣vice of Christ,</HI> as the <HI>Service of the Pantheon,</HI> or <HI>all the Heathen Deities</HI> could be, for it is as effectually <HI>the Service of Devils,</HI> as the latter!—"<HI>Whosoever commit∣eth</HI> SIN <HI>is the</HI> SERVANT <HI>of</HI> SIN;" (John viii. 34.) and if <HI>"the Servant of Sin,"</HI> then also the <HI>Servant of the Devil;</HI> for—"<HI>He that committeth</HI> SIN (said the same Apostle) IS OF THE DEVIL." (1 John iii.8.)—And though Men are not so lost to Common Sense in these more enlightened Days of <HI>Christianity,</HI> as personally to worship at the Shrines of <HI>Demons</HI> or <HI>Devils,</HI> yet they serve the <HI>Devil</HI> as <HI>effectually as ever</HI> to the Destruction of their own Souls, by yielding to his temptations, whether through <HI>Mammon</HI> or <HI>Carnal Lust!</HI>—For— <Q><HI>Know ye not that the</HI> UNRIGHTEOUS <HI>shall</HI> NOT IN∣HERIT THE KINGDOM OF GOD?<HI>be not deceived; neither Fornicators, nor Idolaters, nor Adulterers, nor Effeminate, nor Abusers of themselves with Mankind, nor Thieves, nor Covetous, nor Drunkards, nor Re∣vilers, nor Extortioners, shall</HI> INHERIT THE KING∣DOM OF GOD</Q> I Cor. vi. 9 and 10.</P>
<P>Thus it is clearly demonstrable (I trust) that Man∣kind may be guilty of <HI>Idolatry,</HI> and of <HI>serving Devils,</HI> without paying any personal Adoration to their <HI>Idols;</HI> and on this I found my warning not only to <HI>Slave-dealers</HI> and <HI>Slave-holders,</HI> but also to my Countrymen
<PB N="146" REF="149"/>in general. The dangerous prevalency of the <HI>Devil</HI>'s Empire in these kingdoms, through the <HI>service</HI> of <HI>Mammon</HI> and of <HI>Carnal Lust,</HI> may be known by the following general Marks. 1st. By the shameful Spi∣rit of <HI>Time-serving, Venality,</HI> and <HI>Private Interest,</HI> which is every where predominant, to the destruction of <HI>true Loyalty</HI> and National Independence. 2dly, By the increased number of notorious <HI>Gaming Houses,</HI> which are frequented by the Nobility and Gentry of this Kingdom for Days and Nights together! 3dly, By the multitudes of poor female <HI>Prostitutes</HI> which swarm in the publick Streets; and also by the fre∣quency of Masquerades and Midnight Balls, which apparently afford, to the idle and vicious part of Man∣kind, the most dangerous opportunities of triumphing over unwary virtue, and of spreading the baneful taint of <HI>Prostitution</HI> amongst females of superior Rank, where∣by many persons of Rank and figure in the gay World are become almost as notoriously <HI>dedicated</HI> (as it were) to <HI>Venus,</HI> or the Assyrian Goddess <HI>Mylitta</HI> (See Herodo∣tus, Lib. i. p. 83.) as ever the Heathens were of old! But the greatest mark of <HI>National Infamy,</HI> and of Satan's Empire amongst us, (and that, indeed, which at pre∣sent I am engaged more particularly to oppose) is the shameful public encouragement given to the <HI>African Slave Trade;</HI> wherein the Service of <HI>Mammon</HI> and of the <HI>Devil</HI> is rendered apparent by the <HI>horrible destruc∣tion of the human Species</HI> which it annually occasions! A particular State of that Trade lies now before me, whereby it appears, that the <Q><HI>number of Negro Slaves

<P><Q>The only thing that has occurred liere worth writing to you, since my last, is a plot that has been for some time formed among the Negroes, to poison every white person in the coun∣try: this hellish plot was luckily discovered, before put into execution; and for which we ought to be thankful to God.

Their HEADS ARE FIXED ON POLES ALONG THE HIGH ROADS, as a warning to the rest.</Q></P>
<P>A Friend of mine assured me that he was present some years ago at one of these horrid executions; when a poor negro man was absolutely BURNT ALIVE! The unfortunate man was fastened down to the ground with forked sticks drove into the earth, and sire was placed at his feet, and was gradually removed nearer to the vital parts as the limbs were consumed!

And the archers shot at King Josiah: and the King said to his servants, Have me away; for I am sore wounded. His servants there∣fore took him out of that chariot and put him into the second chariot that he had; and they brought him to Jerusalem, and <HI>he died,</HI> and was buried in one of the sepulchres of his fathers.</Q> 2 Chron. xxxv. 20 to 24.

<P>This manifest contrasted allusion to <HI>Zedekiah</HI> makes it seem very probable, that the Prophecies of this 23d chapter were also pronounced in the presence of ZEDEKIAH <HI>and his Court,</HI> at the same time that Jeremiah went <Q><HI>down to the House</HI> of the King of Judah,</Q> to de∣clare the solemn <HI>Message,</HI> or <HI>Remon∣strance,</HI> contained in the 22d chap∣ter

The dates likewise of the Prophecies in several of the following Chapters are also exactly noted in the text to be dif∣ferent from the time supposed by <HI>Gratius:</HI> as for in∣stance —A <HI>prior date</HI> is expressly assigned to the 25th Chapter—it being intituled. <Q><HI>The word that came to Jenemiah concerning all the people of Judah in the 4th</HI> YEAR <HI>of</HI> JEHOIAKIM <HI>the son of Josiah King of Ju∣dah, that was</HI> THE FIRST YEAR OF NEBUCHAD∣REZZAR <HI>King of Babylon.</HI></Q> And again, the two next Chapters (viz. <HI>the 26th and part of the 27th</HI>) though <HI>posterior</HI> with refpect to the order of the Book, have exact dates assigned them, which are <HI>prior</HI> even to the 24th and 25th Chapters, for they are expressly declared to have been revealed <Q><HI>In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim,</HI></Q> &amp;c.

<PB N="168" REF="171"/>(<HI>viz.</HI> in the ninth year of Zedekiah) that the Monarch sent Messengers to

This Prophecy was punctually fulfilled when AHAZ <HI>King of Judah</HI> hired TIG∣LATH-PILESER <HI>King of Assyria</HI> to help him against the SYRIANS, for we read

<P><PB N="245" REF="248"/>To these Judgements of the several Nations the Prophet now adds the Condemnation of <HI>Judah,</HI> left the Jews should imagine that GOD'S VENGEANCE was only to be denounced against <HI>the Heathen Nations.</HI>— <Q><HI>Thus saith the Lord; for three Transgressions of Judah, and for four, I will not turn away</HI> (the pu∣nishment) <HI>thereof; because they have</HI> DESPISED THE LAW OF THE LORD,</Q> [now the Apostle Paul informs us, that <Q><HI>all the Law is fulfilled in one word,</HI> (even) <HI>in this; Thou shalt love thy Neighbour as thyself.</HI></Q> Galat. v. 14. and, consequently, the OPPRESSION OF THE POOR (of which the Jews were notoriously guilty, as I have shewn) was (next to Idolatry) one of the most heinous Transgressions of the Law, which principally drew down God's Vengeance upon them, though it is not particularly mentioned in this place]— <Q><HI>and have not kept his Commandments;

<P>And last of all is declared the PUR∣POSE of <HI>Retribution</HI> and <HI>Vengeance,</HI> that was PURPOSED upon the People of <HI>Israel,</HI> to whom the Prophet Amos was more particularly sent, to warn them of their approaching CAPTIVITY, on account of their notorious <HI>oppressions,</HI> and for the SLAVE-TRADE in particular.— <Q><HI>Thus saith the Lord, for three transgressions of Israel, and for four, I will not turn away</HI> (the punishment) <HI>thereof; be∣cause they</HI> SOLD THE RIGHTEOUS FOR SILVER, <HI>and the</HI> POOR FOR A PAIR OF SHOES.</Q> Amos ii. 6. And in the next chapter the prophet is di∣rected to call upon their old enemies the Philistines and Egyptians to bear
<PB N="247" REF="250"/>witness to the cause of God's vengeance on his own people: <Q><HI>Publish in the Palaces of</HI> ASHDOD, <HI>and in the Pa∣laces of the Land of Egypt, and say, Assemble yourselves upon the mountains of</HI> SAMARIA, <HI>and behold the great</HI> TUMULTS <HI>in the midst thereof, and the</HI> OPPRESSED IN THE MIDST THEREOF. <HI>For they</HI> KNOW NOT TO DO RIGHT<NOTE N="(161)" PLACE="foot"><P>The Prophet Amos charges them still fur∣ther with their shameful perversion of JUSTICE and NATURAL RIGHT, in the 5 th chapter and 7th verse, — <Q><HI>Ye who</HI> TURN JUDGEMENT TO WORMWOOD, and LEAVE OFF RIGHTEOUSNESS IN THE EARTH.</Q> And a little afterwards he charges them with notorious corruption— <Q><HI>For I know your manifold transgressions, and your mighty sins: they</HI> AFFLICT THE JUST, <HI>they</HI> TAKE A BRIBE, <HI>and they</HI> TURN ASIDE THE POOR IN THE GATE (<HI>from their</HI> RIGHT). <HI>Therefore the prudent shall keep silence in that time: for it is an evil time.</HI></Q> He then warns them to make use of that <HI>Natural Knowledge</HI> of <HI>Good and Evil,</HI> which all mankind inherit from our first parents— <Q><HI>Seek</HI> GOOD, <HI>and not</HI> EVIL</Q> (says the Prophet): <Q><HI>that ye may live: and so the Lord, the God of Hosts, shall be with you, as ye have spoken.

<PB N="248" REF="251"/>GOOD, <HI>and establish</HI> JUDGEMENT <HI>in the Gate, it may that the Lord God of Hosts will be gracious unto the Remnant of Joseph.</HI></Q>—Thus the ISRAELITES might have saved themselves from God's Vengeance by a timely repentance, but they were too corrupt and wicked, it seems, to take warning: for the Judge∣ment is, immediately after, denounced on account of the said NATIONAL CORRUPTION AND INJUSTICE. — <Q><HI>Therefore, the Lord, the God of Hosts, the Lord saith thus;</HI> WAILING <HI>shall be in all thy streets; and they shall say in all the highways,</HI> ALAS!

<P>Now let the inhabitants of Great Britain examine themselves, and enquire, whether there are not COR∣RUPTIONS and INJUSTICE among them also, which may be equally liable to draw down <HI>God's</HI> VEN∣GEANCE? Whether their Representatives in the great National Assembly, or <HI>"Congregation of the People,"</HI> do not annually encourage and promote the AFRI∣CAN SLAVE-TRADE, which includes infinitely more OPPRESSION and INJUSTICE <HI>than the Israelites</HI> were ever guilty of! and whether the poor <HI>Miners, Colliers,</HI> and <HI>Saliers</HI> of Scotland, who lately applied to them for relief from the monstrous OPPRESSION and IN∣JUSTICE of the unreasonable Landholders (an op∣pression
<PB N="249" REF="252"/>at least equal to, if not far exceeding the Israelitish Bondage of the Poor) have yet received <HI>re∣dress</HI> for the Injuries done them? or whether, on the contrary, the <HI>Injustice</HI> (which never had any other foundation but that of <HI>unjust Force</HI> and <HI>Usurpation</HI>) is not now confirmed for a certain number of years lon∣ger by act of Parliament! But, O my countrymen! let us call to mind (before it is too late) the dreadful consequences of turning <Q>JUDGEMENT INTO WORMWOOD,</Q> and of <Q><HI>leaving off Righteousness in the Earth!</HI></Q> Let us remember the heavy Judge∣ments that are denounced against the <HI>Oppressions of the poor,</HI> and that there is ONE who will surely avenge their cause,— <Q>THE LORD (JEHOVAH) <HI>is</HI> HIS NAME <HI>that strengtheneth the</HI> SPOILED <HI>against the</HI> STRONG, <HI>so that the</HI> SPOILED <HI>shall come</HI> AGAINST THE FOR∣TRESS.

<P>The whole tenour of the Scriptures teaches us, that SLAVERY was ever <HI>de∣testable in the sight of God,</HI> insomuch that it has generally been denounced (and, of course, inflicted) as the punish∣ment of the most abandoned Sinners; of which I have already given a great variety of instances.</P>
<P>Let us therefore, before it is too late, take warning by these tremendous examples of GOD'S VENGEANCE against this kind of <HI>Oppression,</HI> which the Scrip∣tures
<PB N="303" REF="306"/>hold forth, not only to <HI>this Na∣tion,</HI> but to all the World besides! The examples which I have quoted of <HI>God's Vengeance,</HI> denounced against the <HI>Israelites</HI> and <HI>Jews</HI> for TYRANNY, are not more striking than the examples of VENGEANCE denounced against the very <HI>Instruments of that</HI> VENGEANCE (the Assyrians and Babylonians) ex∣pressly on <HI>the same account;</HI> for though the latter were mere <HI>Instruments in God's hand,</HI> to punish the Jews <HI>in kind,</HI> yet they were themselves subjected to the like RETRIBUTION!</P>
<P>Nay, THE VENGEANCE was de∣nounced particularly against the Chal∣deans (and the cause of it, also, was de∣clared) <HI>long before they were guilty of the offence,</HI> as I have before remarked, even while the Jews, the Nation vindicated by this punishment, were exercising that <HI>Tyranny</HI> at home for which they
<PB N="304" REF="307"/>were then doomed to the <HI>Babylonian Yoke,</HI> and thereby laid the foundation for the future retaliated CAPTIVITY <HI>of their haughty</HI> CONQUERORS <HI>the Chal∣deans!</HI></P>
<P>And have not we just reason to dread the severe VENGEANCE OF ALMIGHTY GOD, when it is notorious, that the <HI>Tyranny</HI> exercised in the British Colo∣nies is infinitely more unmerciful than that which was formerly exercised by the <HI>Chaldeans,</HI> insomuch that the state of the Jews in their <HI>Captivity</HI> might be esteemed rather as <HI>Freedom</HI> than <HI>Bon∣dage,</HI> when compared with the <HI>deplo∣rable Servitude</HI> of the wretched NEGRO SLAVES, as well as of the white Ser∣vants, in our Colonies?</P>

<SALUTE>Most Gracious Sovereign,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE your Majesty's dutiful and loyal subjects the Burgesses of Virginia, now met in general assembly, beg leave with all humility to approach your Royal Presence.</P>
<P>The many instances of your Majesty's benevolent intentions and most gracious disposition to promote the prosperity and happiness of your subjects in the colo∣nies, encouraged us to look up to the Throne, and implore your Majesty's paternal assistance, in avert∣ing <HI>a Calamity of a most alarming nature.</HI></P>
<P>The importation of slaves into the colonies from the coast of Africa hath long been considered as a trade of <HI>great Inhumanity,</HI> and under its present en∣couragement, we have too much reason to fear <HI>will endanger the very existence of your Majesty's American dominions.</HI></P>
<P>We are sensible that some of your Majesty's sub∣jects in Great Britain may reap emolument from this sort of Traffic; but when we consider that it greatly retards the settlement of the colonies with <HI>more white inhabitants,</HI> and may <HI>in time have the most destructive influence,</HI> we presume to hope, that the interest of a few will be disregarded, when placed in competition with the security and happiness of such numbers of your Majesty's dutiful and loyal subjects.</P>
<P>Deeply imprest with these sentiments, we most hum<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly beseech your Majesty to remove all those re∣straints on your Majesty's Governors of this colony, which inhibit their assenting to such laws as might check so very pernicious a commerce.</P>
<P>Your Majesty's antient colony and dominion of Virginia hath at all times, and upon every occasion, been entirely devoted to your Majesty's facred person and government; and we cannot forego this oppor∣tunity of renewing those assurances of the truest loy∣alty and warmest affection, which we have so often, with the greatest sineerity, given to the best of Kings, whose wisdom and goodness we esteem the surest pledge of the happiness of all his people.</P>
<P>Resolved, nemine contradicente, That the House doth agree with the Committee in the said address to be presented to his Majesty.</P>
<P>Resolved, That an address be presented to his Ex∣cellency the Governor, to desire that he will be pleas∣ed to transmit the address to his Majesty, and to support it in such manner as he shall think most likely to pro∣mote the desirable end proposed.</P>

Your Peti∣tioners also beg, that you will not only provide against the future importation of Slaves into this Colony, by such ways as you may think best, but to enable such persons as shall chuse it to manumit them by making them useful and happy upon equitable principles to the Owners and the Public, as in your wisdom may appear most conducive to those good ends.

<P>The humble Petition of divers Inhabitants of the County of Essex in the said Province, sheweth,</P>
<P>THAT many of his Majesty's loyal subjects in this Province observe, with uneasiness, the great increase of negro slaves from the coast of Africa, which is con∣sidered, not only as preventative of the importation and increase of white servants and labourers, by which the present extravagant price of labour would be pro∣portionably lessened, but also as laying a foundation of that which may hereafter prove dangerous to Go∣vernment, and subversive of the liberties of the peo∣ple, it being justly observed, <Q>That slaves are the natural enemies of society, and their numbers must always be dangerous.</Q> It is also with dissatisfac∣tion that some of the inhabitants of this province ob∣serve an Act of Assembly in force, for preventing the manumitting and setting free any negro slave, however healthy and able to earn his or her living, without such terms as many are wholly unable to, and others cannot without great difficulty comply with, whereby they are obliged to keep their fellow men in a slavery (to them unlawful and contrary to their Christian principles). In order therefore to remedy these growing evils, your petitioners humbly pray this Honourable House, that they would take such measures as to them in their wisdom may seem meet, to obtain an alteration of his Majesty's Instruction to his Excellency the Governor, relating to the African trade, so that his Excellency may be at liberty to con∣sent to such laws for the preventing the future im∣portation of negro slaves into this province, as to the Legislature may appear just and reasonable. And also that the Act of Assembly relating to the manumitting of negro slaves may be repealed, and the inhabitants of this province allowed by law to set free any of their negro slaves, who shall appear to some proper judi∣cature to be able of body and sound in mind, and under a certain age to be fixed by this Honourable House, or under such other reasonable restrictions, as to the Legislature may seem just and reasonable.—And your petitioners as in duty bound shall ever pray.</P></NOTE> A number also

<P>The Petition of a number of the Inhabitants of the City and County of Philadelphia,</P>
<P>Respectfully sheweth,</P>
<P>THAT the importation of the natives of Guinea, to be sold and used as slaves in the provinces and islands of the British dominions in America, has long been an occasion of deep concern to a great number of the Inhabitants of this province, as well on account of its inconsistency with the whole tenor of the Christian religion, as because of the evil in∣fluence it has on the religious and moral conduct of the people, and the dreadful consequence which, it is to be feared, will one day attend in those parts where it prevails.</P>
<P>We are the more encouraged to lay this important object before you, as we understand some of the colo∣nies have been led into serious consideration, as well of the iniquity of the practice, as of the dangerous situation some of them are in, particularly the pro∣vince of <HI>Virginia,</HI> whose House of Burgesses has lately <HI>petitioned the King,</HI> from a deep sensibility of the danger, and pernicious consequences which will be attendant on a continuation of this MOST INI∣QUITOUS TRAFFICK.</P>
<P>We your petitioners, therefore, most earnestly be∣seech you, to take this matter, which we apprehend to be of the utmost consequence to the welfare and safety of the British colonies, under your most serious consideration, and to use your utmost endeavours with the other colonies, in making such representations to the King as to you may appear most effectual towards putting a stop to this mighty evil."</P>

<P>And yet with all these spiritual ad∣vantages, I fear we far exceed the Jews in the enormity and multitude of our <HI>National Oppressions:</HI> how then shall we escape the just Vengeance of God, if we persevere in these inhuman prac∣tices?

He sacri∣ficed also and burned incense in the high places, and on the hills, and under every

Wherefore the Lord his God delivered him into the hand of the King of</HI> SYRIA; <HI>and they smote him, and</HI> CARRIED AWAY A GREAT MULTITUDE OF THEM CAPTIVES, <HI>and brought</HI> (them) <HI>to</HI> DAMASCUS. <HI>And he was also delivered into the hand of the King of</HI> ISRAEL, <HI>who smote him with a great slaughter: for</HI> PEKAH</Q> (the King of Israel) <Q><HI>the Son of</HI> RE∣MALIAH <HI>slew in Judah</HI> AN HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND IN ONE DAY, <HI>all valiant men; because</HI> THEY HAD FORSAKEN THE LORD GOD OF THEIR FATHERS. <HI>And</HI> ZICHRI, <HI>a mighty man of Ephraim, slew</HI> MAA∣SEIAH THE KING'S SON, <HI>and</HI> AZ∣RIKAM THE GOVERNOR OF THE HOUSE, <HI>and</HI> ELKANAH (that was) NEXT TO THE KING. <HI>And the Chil∣dren of</HI> ISRAEL <HI>carried away captive of their Brethren</HI> TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND WOMEN, SONS AND

<P><PB N="324" REF="327"/>This reason, as well as the undaunt∣ed Resolution of those who gave it, had the proper effect upon the Israelitish Soldiers, who, notwithstanding the ge∣neral depravity of their countrymen, <HI>still deserved the name of</HI> MEN, by de∣monstrating, that they were not insen∣sible to REASON, and that they thought themselves entitled (though SOLDIERS) to that <HI>common Right of</HI> HUMAN NA∣TURE, <HI>the Right of judging for them∣selves in matters of conscience,</HI> without which no man can be truely <HI>honourable:</HI> for as soon as they heard the just remon∣strance of the four Noblemen, they quitted <HI>the Prey</HI> and <HI>the Plunder</HI> (a hard thing for Soldiers to submit to) with∣out waiting, it seems, for the word of command from the King or his Princes!—<HI>"So the armed men"</HI> (says the Text) <Q><HI>lest the Captives and the Spoil before</HI> THE PRINCES <HI>and</HI> ALL THE CON∣GREGATION.</Q> Ver. 14.</P>

But afterwards a complaint of <HI>tu∣multuous Elections,</HI> together with the supposed Royal Preroga∣tive of granting the Investiture of <HI>Temporalities</HI> (though the <HI>Temporalities,</HI> being originally granted to support the <HI>Dignity</HI> of the Office, cannot reasonably be so far drawn from the first intention, as to deprive the Office of that real <HI>Dignity</HI> which arises from a free Election) served the designs of Emperors and Kings as <HI>a pretence</HI> to invade <HI>the Freedom of Election;</HI> and the same <HI>pretence</HI> of TUMULT proved equally favourable to the op∣posite designs of Popes; so that these jarring interests seemed united, however, in their endeavours (as it were by one Spirit of <HI>Antichrist</HI>) to deprive the Church of her <HI>ancient Right,</HI> which
<PB N="333" REF="337"/>(had it been maintained) would probably have prevented most of the future usurpations of the <HI>Papal Antichrist;</HI> and therefore <Q><HI>the Policy of the Court of Rome at the same time began by de∣grees to</HI> EXCLUDE THE LAITY <HI>from any share in these</HI> ELECTIONS,</Q> (says the learned Judge Blackstone,) <Q><HI>and to confine them wholly to the</HI> CLERGY, <HI>which at length was completely effected.</HI></Q> 1 Blackstone, c. 11. p. 378. The ori∣ginal ground for the complaint of <HI>tumult</HI> in these <HI>Elections</HI> was probably occasioned by the neglect of that unexceptionable Apostolic mode of Election described in Acts i. 15 to 26; for when Christianity began to be corrupted by Vows of <HI>Celibacy,</HI> and other Popish and Diabolical Doctrines, the <HI>Clergy</HI> and <HI>Laity</HI> began to have opposite interests to serve (which ought never to be) in the Choice of their Bishop, and, of course, the two con∣tending parties would reciprocally depend upon their own acti∣vity, zeal, or address for success in the <HI>Election;</HI> so that <HI>Tumult</HI> (the old complaint) must be the necessary consequence; whereas had it been an indispensible form to nominate TWO qualified persons (viz. either <HI>two</HI> by the promiscuous suffrages of both parties, or <HI>one</HI> by each party), and afterwards, <HI>in solemn prayer,</HI> to submit the final decision to the Providence of God by a Lot (as in the <HI>Apostolic Election</HI>), there could be no room for conten∣tion: the undue influence and partiality of <HI>Individuals</HI> would be effectually checked; and, above all, the joint prayers of <HI>both parties,</HI> in an appeal to God's decision, would certainly add <HI>So∣lemnity</HI> (instead of <HI>Tumult</HI>) to the <HI>Election,</HI> if not also much ad∣ditional

Test. p. 460. This remark opens to us a very satisfactory reason why the Apostles discontinued the primitive mode of <HI>Election,</HI> and took upon themselves the appointment of <HI>Bishops:</HI> for while they were en∣dowed with manifest <HI>supernatural power</HI> in working Miracles, their authority to <HI>appoint Bishops,</HI> without the formulary precau∣tions of the first precedent, could not be questioned, because their appointment of Bishops was clearly the appointment of the <HI>Holy Ghost:</HI> but when these <HI>extraordinary</HI> gifts ceased in the Church, the primitive mode of Election became once more desirable, as being best suited to the <HI>ordinary</HI> state of the Church in all succeeding ages. This is not a singular opinion of my own: the learned Bengelius (p. 459) refers us not only to those who have thought as I do, but also to examples of it's having been really practised in Episcopal Elections:— <Q><HI>Hodie quoque in</HI> ELEGEND IS EPIS∣COPIS SORTI LOCUM ESSE POSSE <HI>censet justus Jonas ad hunc locum, &amp; memorabile exemplum resert Comenius in Hist-Ecoles.

<PB N="333" REF="337"/>proved that the <HI>Churches of Britain and Ireland</HI> have a just and ancient <HI>Right</HI> to <HI>elect</HI> their own Bishops, and did actually exercise that right for many ages, till the antichristian Usurpations of <HI>Monks</HI> and <HI>Popes</HI> over the
<PB N="334" REF="338"/>secular (or parochial) Clergy occasioned the interfer∣ence of Kings, so it may as clearly be demonstrated, that the present mode of <HI>Election</HI> by Writ of <HI>Congé D' Eslire,</HI> sent to the several Cathedral Chapters, toge∣ther
<PB N="335" REF="339"/><Q><HI>with a Letter Missive, containing the name of the person which they shall Elect and Chase?</HI></Q> (agreeable to the Act of 25 Hen. VIII. cli. xx. sec. 4.) is a total perversion of that just and ancient <HI>Right</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>In a little Tract (by <HI>John Barnes,</HI> an English Benedictine) intituled, <HI>Sententia de Ecclesiae Britannicae Privilegiis,</HI> which was printed together with some little Tracts of Archbishop Usher in 1687, we find still a more ample testimony of the <HI>ancient Right</HI> of chusing <HI>Bishops:</HI>— <Q><HI>Cùm</HI> ANTIQUI MORES <HI>Ecclesiae suae</HI></Q> (speaking of the ancient BRITISH, SCOTCH, and IRISH) <Q><HI>postularènt ut</HI> OMMIA <HI>inter se</HI> SYNODICE <HI>agerent, tum pro</HI> EPISCOPORUM ORDINATIONIBUS, <HI>tum pro aliis negotiis Ecclesiasticis.</HI></Q> <HI>Verba corum ex</HI> BEDA, <HI>lib.</HI> ii. 6.2. <HI>Ec∣eles. Hist. sunt,</HI> QUOD NON POSSUNT ABSQUE SUORUM CON∣SENSU
<PB N="337" REF="341"/>ET LICENTIA PRISCIS ABDICARE MORIBUS." P. 154. And after citing an example from <HI>Bede,</HI> concerning <HI>the Election of a Bishop</HI> (viz. Aidan) by a Scotch Synod, at the request of the Saxon King <HI>Oswald,</HI> to instruct and preside over the Ministry of the newly converted Saxon or English Church (see p. 154. and 155), he further remarks:— <Q><HI>Et ex</HI> HUNGTING-DONIENSI</Q> (says he) <Q><HI>lib.</HI> iii. <HI>Hist. &amp;</HI> BED. <HI>lib.</HI> ii. <HI>constat</HI> ET SCOTOS ET BRITANNOS OMNIA SUA COMMUNI CON∣SENSU EGISSE.</Q></P>
<P>It appears also, that the <HI>Saxon</HI> or <HI>English</HI> Church, though much less ancient than the <HI>British, Irish,</HI> and <HI>Scotch</HI> Churches, did yet enjoy the same inestimable privilege of <HI>electing Bishops.</HI> The Monk <HI>Matthew Paris</HI> has transmitted to us a memorable example of this, in his Account of the Election, A. D. 1095, of the celebrated <HI>Ulstan</HI> to be Bishop of Worcester:— <Q><HI>Processu au∣temtemporis</HI> ULSTANUS (ELECTO <HI>ad Archiepiscopatum Ebora∣censem</HI> ALDREDO) <HI>unanimi consensu, tam</HI> CLERI <HI>quam</HI> TO∣TIUS PLEBIS, <HI>Rege insuper ut quem vellent sibi eligerent prae∣sulem &amp; animarum Pastorem annuente,</HI> IN EPISCOPUM <HI>ejus∣dem loci</HI> ELIGITUR.</Q> P. 20. And even in later times, when <HI>the Romish Corruptions</HI> had so far prevailed as to exclude the LAITY from Elections, yet the Clergy still enjoyed <Q><HI>the free right of electing their Prelates, whether Abbots or Bishops;</HI></Q> for the learned Judge Blackstone informs us, that <HI>this right</HI> was granted in a charter <Q><HI>to all the Monasteries and Cathedrals in the Kingdom</HI></Q> by King John, see vol. i. p. 379; and also that <Q><HI>this grant was expressly recognized and confirmed in King John's</HI>
<PB N="338" REF="342"/>MAGNA CARTA, <HI>and was again established by</HI> STATUTE 25 <HI>Edward</HI> III. <HI>St.</HI> 6. § 3.</Q> <HI>Ibid.</HI> This Statute first gave <HI>parliamentary authority,</HI> indeed, to the King's <HI>Congé D' Eslire</HI> (though it was in use long before), and acknowledges the King's Right of <HI>Assent</HI> or Approbation <HI>"after the Election;"</HI> yet it contains nothing which can remove the prudent and reasonable limitation to which that <HI>Assent</HI> or <HI>Approbation</HI> was formerly sub∣ject, <HI>viz.</HI> that it <Q>WAS NOT TO BE DENIED WITHOUT A REASONABLE AND LAWFUL CAUSE.</Q> Judge Blackstone, b. i. c. 11. p. 379. And this very Act (which was manifestly ordained to restrain the simoniacal practices and shameful usurpa∣tions of the Bishops of Rome) expressly acknowledges the Right of FREE ELECTIONS in the Church, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q>that the FREE ELECTIONS of the Archbishops, Bishops, and all other Dignities and Benefices ELECTIVE <HI>in England,</HI> shall hold,</Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The <HI>Right</HI> was also fully established by preceding Statutes, still <HI>in force,</HI> though (unhappily for this Kingdom) not <HI>in use;</HI> as —"<HI>There shall be</HI> FREE ELECTION <HI>of Dignities of the Church.</HI>" 9 Edward II. c. 14. Title. And again, <Q>ELECTIONS OUGHT TO BE FREE.</Q> 3 Edward I. c. 5. Mr. Ruffhead, in his useful Index to the Statutes, very properly refers us, under the head of "ELECTION of BISHOPS," to this last-mentioned
<PB N="339" REF="343"/>Statute; for <HI>Episcopal Elections</HI> ought certainly to be included in the meaning of the said Statute, as well as <HI>all other Elections;</HI> for an ELECTION without a CHOICE is a manifest contradiction in term<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and NO ELECTION.</P>
<PB N="336" REF="340"/></NOTE> abovemen∣tioned, and is entirely destructive of all the desirable purposes of a free <HI>Election.</HI> This practice, however, cannot be censured in stronger terms than those in
<PB N="337" REF="341"/>which it is expressly condemned by a <HI>subsequent Act of Parliament,</HI> (1 Edw. VI. chap. ii.) though the former Act is supposed to be still in force, viz. <Q><HI>The said</HI> ELECTIONS <HI>be in very deed</HI> NO ELECTIONS <HI>but only
<PB N="338" REF="342"/>by a Writ of</HI> CONGE D'ESLIRE, <HI>have colours, sha∣dows, and pretences of Elections, serving nevertheless to no purpose,</HI></Q> &amp;c.</P>
<P>If it had not been for this notorious defect in point of <HI>Election,</HI> and the general idea of its <HI>consequences,</HI> I
<PB N="339" REF="343"/>am persuaded that the late worthy Primate of Eng∣land, would not have found such opposition in hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> endeavours some few years ago to promote <HI>the esta∣blishment of</HI> EPISCOPACY <HI>in America!</HI></P>
<PB N="331" REF="335"/></NOTE>, to charge
<PB N="332" REF="336"/><HI>your Order,</HI> in particular, with the omission. The <HI>crying Sin</HI> has hitherto
<PB N="333" REF="337"/>been far distant from your <HI>sight,</HI> and perhaps was never fully represented to
<PB N="334" REF="338"/>you, or, like <HI>faithful Watchmen of Israel,</HI> you would long ago have warned our
<PB N="335" REF="339"/>Nation of the Danger: but I now call upon you, IN THE NAME OF GOD,
<PB N="336" REF="340"/>for assistance! <HI>Ye know the Scriptures,</HI> and therefore to you, my Lords, in
<PB N="337" REF="341"/>particular I appeal! If I have misrepre∣sented <HI>the Word of God,</HI> on which my
<PB N="338" REF="342"/><HI>Opposition to</HI> SLAVERY is founded, point out my errors, and I submit: but if, on the other hand, you should perceive that the Texts here quoted are really
<PB N="339" REF="343"/>applicable to the question before us, that my conclusions from thence are fairly drawn, and that the Examples of GOD'S VENGEANCE against TYRANTS and SLAVE-HOLDERS ought strictly to warn us against <HI>similar Oppressions</HI> and <HI>similar Vengeance,</HI> you will not then, I trust, be backward <HI>in this Cause of</HI> GOD <HI>and</HI> MAN. <HI>Stand up</HI> (let me intreat you) <Q><HI>for the Land;</HI> MAKE UP THE HEDGE,</Q> to save your Country; perhaps it is not yet too late! Enter a solemn protest, my Lords, against those who <Q><HI>have oppressed the Stranger wrong∣fully.</HI></Q> Ye know that the Testimo∣nies I have quoted are of God! Warn
<PB N="340" REF="344"/>therefore the Nobles and Senators of these Kingdoms, that they incur not a double load of Guilt! as the burthen, not only of the <HI>much-injured African Strangers,</HI> but also of <HI>our Country's Ruin,</HI> must rest on the heads of those who withhold their Testimony against the CRYING SIN Of TOLERATED SLAVERY! For <Q>I KNOW <HI>that the</HI> LORD <HI>will main∣tain the</HI> CAUSE <HI>of the Afflicted, and the</HI> RIGHT <HI>of the Poor.</HI></Q> Psa. cxl. 12.</P>
