<HEAD>PROLOGUE, WRITTEN BY MR. TAYLOR.</HEAD>
<SP>
<STAGE>SPOKEN BY MR. BETTERTON.</STAGE>
<L>A Well-known Muse, who labours once a-year,</L>
<L>And oft has found a safe Asylum here,</L>
<L>Though Critic storms a Mother's fears excite,</L>
<L>With her new Offspring ventures forth to-night.</L>
<L>Conscious the features must betray the Sire,</L>
<L>She seeks for no disguise of vain attire;</L>
<L>What honest Nature gave she brings to view,</L>
<L>And for a kind adoption rests on you.</L>
<L>Yet haply now with reason she appears</L>
<L>Oppress'd with more than e'en maternal fears.</L>
<L>For since she last enjoy'd your fost'ring smile,</L>
<L>A German Rival's charms have caught our Isle.</L>
<L>And though she knows that Rival's favor'd race,</L>
<L>With daring force combine a soft'ning grace,</L>
<L>She knows, besides, that one of native breed</L>
<L>May always hope with Britons to succeed:</L>
<L>And hence, though fashion call her bigot-sool,</L>
<L>She takes no lessons from a foreign school—</L>
<L>But with a patriot pride she lets you know,</L>
<L>"'Tis English! English, Sirs! from top to toe!"</L>
<L>While on your liberal candour we rely,</L>
<L>And Fashion's rage with patriot zeal defy,</L>
<L>Think not our Author sees with jealous pain</L>
<L>Exotic merit British laurels gain—</L>
<L>No—when to ALBION'S hospitable shore</L>
<L>MISFORTUNE flies protection to implore;</L>
<L>Or GENIUS darting from a distant sphere,</L>
<L>That mental Comet spreads its radiance here;</L>
<L>May Britons glow with philanthropic fire,</L>
<L>Eager alike to cherish and admire!</L>

<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> GEOFFRY <HI>and two other Servants.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GEOFFRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>COME, bustle, bustle—all to your several oc∣cupations.—Bless me, who'd have thought of Sir Hervey coming home:—go—enter the house, and prepare for his reception—I'll wait his arrival here.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Servants exeunt.</STAGE>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> JULIANA.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Juliana.</SPEAKER>
<P>Good morning, good old Geoffry.— I have once more eluded the vigilance of my per∣secutor—once more stolen forth from the castle, pur∣posely to visit this spot; and if my father hears of it, I hope he won't be angry with me:—though he denies me his protection, surely he will not pre∣clude me from contemplating scenes that remind me of him and my dear Mother!—why, what's the matter? you seem agitated.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Geoffry.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well I may, Miss Juliana—your father
<PB N="2" REF="5"/>is arrived from Italy, and I expect him here this very day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Juliana.</SPEAKER>
<P>Expect my father!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Geoffry.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay; after an absence of thirteen years, I expect Sir Hervey once more at Sutherland-house: —look, here's his letter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Juliana</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(snatching the letter, reading and kissing it).</STAGE>
<P>Oh, I'm so happy!—I shall at last behold, perhaps embrace him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Geoffry.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, I fear otherwise; Sir Hervey is of a most unforgiving disposition, and the wrongs your mother put upon him were of a nature not easily to be forgotten.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Juliana.</SPEAKER>
<P>Wrongs!—what wrongs, Geoffry? is the dark tale for ever to be concealed from me?— I am deserted by my father, and not to know the cause!—Come, good old man! remember, you pro∣mised you would one day tell me, and since we are alone, and may not have another opportunity, come now—unveil the mystery—how, how did my mother wrong him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Geoffry.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then, to keep my word—Sir Hervey ever was, and I fear ever will be, a dupe to fashion and its follies:—he gamed, he intrigued—and though in his heart devoted to Lady Sutherland, he forsook her and his home for scenes of riot and dissipation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Juliana.</SPEAKER>
<P>Unfortunate infatuation!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Geoffry.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lady Sutherland a long while bore this with fortitude and resignation; but young, beautiful, and accomplished, surrounded by admirers and neglected by her husband, she at last listened to the addresses of an artful and designing villain, who convinced her of Sir Hervey's infidelity, and, by means of forged letters and other artifices, persuaded her to elope with him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Juliana.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="3" REF="6"/>
<SPEAKER>Geoffry.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis too true, madam;—but her guilt was of short duration:—in a few days she came back to that house, all penitence and shame.—I shall never forget the day.—I told Sir Hervey of her return, and he in a fit of rage and madness bid me shut the door against her; this she overheard: 'twas too much for a tender nature like hers:—she fled, and soon after died—died of a broken heart!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Juliana</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(bursting into tears).</STAGE>
<P>Oh, for mercy!— my poor, poor mother!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Geoffry.</SPEAKER>
<P>You were then but eight years old, and till that hour the idol of Sir Hervey:—but your likeness to your mother soon making him wish to avoid you, you were removed to the castle; where he invested Mrs. Dazzle with the unlimited power of a guardian over you, and which I fear she has exerted like a tyrant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Juliana.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes.—Sir Hervey could not mean that I should be her prisoner!—But go on: he went abroad—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Geoffry.</SPEAKER>
<P>He did — to Naples, where he has ever since resided: and now, what think you, madam? do you blame the living or the dead?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Juliana.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have no right to condemn either—but in my mind the husband who neglects an amiable wife is responsible for all the evils that ensue.— Died of a broken heart!—oh, that he had but par∣doned her!—then he had had a wife, and I a mo∣ther to console me!—but now—Do I indeed resemble her?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Geoffry.</SPEAKER>
<P>You do—you do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Juliana.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thank Heaven!—I may forgive her, though my father never can.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worry</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(speaking without).</STAGE>
<P>This way, my lad—this way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="4" REF="7"/>
<SPEAKER>Juliana.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha! there's Sir Hervey!—though I wish, you don't know how I dread to see him: let me be gone.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Geoffry.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, 'tis only Worry, his old faithful fol∣lower; honest soul! he and your father were fostered by the same nurse; and, though long since in easy inde∣pendent circumstances, he still follows Sir Hervey from motives of affection.—Suppose you ask him to be a mediator for you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Juliana.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not now—another time, another time —I must return to my prison:—but though I shed tears over the fate of my mother, don't fancy I up∣braid my father.—No! I feel for both—and let him still avoid, still punish and abandon me, I know his motive: and the fond hope that he will one day prove a parent to me, will make me bear even greater ills with patience.—Oh! may that day be not far off! for 'twill be the proudest and the happiest of my life.</P>

<SPEAKER>Worry.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mind, do as I order you; when the baggage arrives let me know. <STAGE>(Exit Servant.)</STAGE> What Geoff!—give me your hand, old Geoff!—Sir Her∣vey is but a stage behind.—'Slife! I thought we should never shake hands again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Geoffry.</SPEAKER>
<P>So did I; 'tis thirteen years <STAGE>(shaking hands and looking hard at Worry);</STAGE> but, heyday! how you are altered, Master Worry!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worry.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I'm not the same man I was.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Geoffry.</SPEAKER>
<P>So I see; but how has it happened?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worry.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't know—I lead a different sort of life—I think; and I'm afraid I drink a great deal.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Geoffry.</SPEAKER>
<P>You drink! you that used to be the most temperate, sober—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="5" REF="8"/>
<SPEAKER>Worry.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay; and I used to hate cards, you know; now I could play all day:—I used to break ap∣pointments; now I come an hour before my time; —and I that always laid in bed till noon, now con∣stantly rise with the crowing of the cock.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Geoffry.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, what the deuce, are you mad?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worry.</SPEAKER>
<P>No—I'm married.—I've got a loving jealous wife!—and whilst Sir Hervey is continually miserable because Lady Sutherland ran away from him, here am I—I tell you what, Geoff—if Mrs. Worry were to run away from me, I'm sure I should be too much of a philosopher to repine on the occasion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Geoffry.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! and is Sir Hervey likewise al∣tered?—or does he still go on rioting in dissipation and extravagance?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worry.</SPEAKER>
<P>Worse and worse—only yesterday he employed Mr. Alltrade to raise five thousand pounds for him on his bond—offered a premium of fifty <HI>per cent.</HI> and the moment he receives the money, away it will go in galas or at the gaming table—No, I beg pardon—not at the gaming table—now a days no money ever goes there.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Geoffry.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! have they left off playing?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worry.</SPEAKER>
<P>No—but they've left off paying;—and that's the reason the faro banks are knocked up— when people only play for love, friendship won't induce them to keep open house.—But Miss Suther∣land—there's Sir Hervey's greatest plague. A meeting with her was his chief motive for leaving Italy, and now we understand she vindicates her mother, and takes part against him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Geoffry.</SPEAKER>
<P>She is belied, cruelly belied!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worry.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay; we have it from the best authority, —Mrs. Dazzle—the lady who brought her up, and for whom I have a message—but of this be
<PB N="6" REF="9"/>assured, Geoff; Sir Hervey's case isn't half so desperate as mine:—he's only tormented by a daughter who will try to break his heart, but I've got a jealous wife, who will actually break my head, heart, and purse strings.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Re-enter</HI> Servant.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Servant.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, the baggage is come.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worry.</SPEAKER>
<P>You hear—Mrs. Worry is arrived.—Come, will you go and be introduced?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Geoffry.</SPEAKER>
<P>With all my heart—but mind now—you'll one day find that Mrs. Dazzle has traduced Miss Sutherland, and only because she was a great favourite of her late husband's. He was a distant relation, you know, and I did hope would have re∣membered her in his will—but no—he, like the rest of her family—he—has forgotten her!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worry.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be sure; who ever got any good by these distant relations? Mrs. Worry has a little thousand; and do you know my apartments are so constantly cram'd with cousins, neices, uncles, aunts, and grandmothers, that at dinner-time I never get a chair to sit upon—I eat flying!—And talk of the comforts of a fire-side, curse me if I've been within ten yards of mine since the day I was married:—not that I complain of cold though—my house is warm enough, I promise you:—but come along; and sorry am I to be convinced of Miss Sutherland's ingratitude.—Were she the girl you describe, I would not only be her friend and advocate, but if Sir Hervey refused to protect her, I would myself be a father to her.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Betty.</SPEAKER>
<P>Even so, ma'am; Miss Juliana first robbed you of your husband's friendship, and now of the Captain's love.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Dazzle.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, the little viper!—but I know how to be amply revenged:—the great object of her life is a reconciliation with her father;—this I have already prevented, and will still prevent.—But the Captain, Betty—do you think he has serious views?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Betty.</SPEAKER>
<P>He serious! what Captain Lavish prefer Juliana Sutherland without a shilling, to the widow Dazzle with a nett estate of five thousand a-year!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Dazzle.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's true:—I married little Jerry for his fortune, and I am certainly sole hei∣ress—to be sure I hav'nt yet seen the will, because he died in London:—but I expect his agent Mr. Alltrade with it every moment, and then, Betty!—poor Juliana!—I hope the Captain will allow her half pay.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Betty.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh you're too liberal, ma'am—but see! here comes Mr. Alltrade with the will.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> ALLTRADE.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alltrade.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well! madam, as good as my word, you see:—this moment arrived with my friend Sir Hervey.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Dazzle.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are very kind, Mr. Alltrade; but there was no occasion to be in any hurry—every body knows how little Jerry loved me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alltrade.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, there's no doubt that the will is completely in your favour; but you had better open it, lest there should be any small bequest or legacies—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Dazzle.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, to oblige you I'll just cast my eye over it— <STAGE>(<HI>takes the will from</HI> ALLTRADE)</STAGE>
<PB N="8" REF="11"/>Poor Jerry!—he used to say he should fall a martyr to love. <STAGE>(Reads will)</STAGE>: <Q>By this my last will, I Jeremiah Dazzle give and bequeath all the pro∣perty of which I die possessed unto that most lovely and accomplished of her sex</Q>—Spare me—spare a poor widow's blushes, Mr. Alltrade.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alltrade.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay! it's not more than you deserve.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Dazzle.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, Sir! <STAGE>(curtseying—then reads on:)</STAGE>—"unto that most lovely and accomplished of her sex, Juliana Sutherland"—Juliana!—why, Mr. Alltrade! <STAGE>(Half crying.)</STAGE></P>

<P>Go on.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Dazzle</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(reads on).</STAGE>
<P><Q>Juliana Suther∣land, whom being deserted by her father, I take a pride in adopting. But my will further is, that she hold the said property no longer than she re∣mains unmarried. In case she marries, I give the same to my widow Deborah Dazzle. And my only motive for thus tying up my cousin Juliana, is to save her from entering into a state to which I fell a martyr.</Q> — Why it's a forgery! he could not—dared not!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alltrade.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay—there's no doubt that it's genu∣ine—but be composed—doesn't Miss Sutherland live in this house?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Dazzle.</SPEAKER>
<P>She does.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alltrade.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then it dawns! it glares upon me!—Mark—if she marries, the estate devolves to you—are not these Mr. Dazzle's words!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Dazzle.</SPEAKER>
<P>They are: and I only wish I had been behind him when he wrote them!.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alltrade.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well: be patient—don't destroy the will, because that's a serious business <STAGE>(pulling up his neckcloth):</STAGE>—only conceal it till you get Juliana a husband—then she forfeits the legacy, and you become heiress to a hundred thousand pounds.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="9" REF="12"/>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Dazzle.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why that looks well—but how?—the Captain won't marry her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alltrade.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, but I will; in the first place her being in this house will give me numberless oppor∣tunities; and in the next I am employed by Sir Hervey to raise five thousand pounds for him on his bond—now if we can get Juliana to join in it, I shall have them both so completely in my power, that if I fail in the character of a lover, I may succeed in that of a creditor:—you understand.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Dazzle.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do—excellent!—and as a re∣ward for your trouble—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alltrade.</SPEAKER>
<P>I only ask a third of the estate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Dazzle.</SPEAKER>
<P>Granted—it is a bargain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alltrade.</SPEAKER>
<P>Say you so?—then let's to work in∣stantly—and look here comes one who, from his influence over Sir Hervey, we must secure as a confederate.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> WORRY.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Dazzle.</SPEAKER>
<P>Worry, my old acquaintance!—I give you joy of your marriage, and sincerely wish you may never know the pangs of widowhood.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alltrade.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so do I with all my heart, Worry.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worry.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I wish with all my soul you'd both keep your wishes to yourselves. <STAGE>(Aside.)</STAGE>—But I wait upon you, madam, from Sir Hervey:—from your account of Miss Sutherland's undutiful and indis∣creet conduct, he persists in not seeing her, and therefore while he stays in the country, he begs she may be more closely confined than ever.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Dazzle.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll do all I can; but she is so art∣ful and designing, that for my part I don't think she'll ever be safe till she gets a husband to pro∣tect her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="10" REF="13"/>
<SPEAKER>Alltrade.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nor I; and I'll tell you a secret, Worry—I love her, and wish to be that husband: and since, from my humble birth and inferior situ∣ation, I cannot aspire to gaining Sir Hervey's con∣sent, will you aid and assist the marriage?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worry.</SPEAKER>
<P>With all my heart—the more matches the better.—When one's in a scrape oneself, nothing's so consoling as to see all one's friends in the same situation. <STAGE>(Aside.)</STAGE> I'll assist you—but about the bond—have you raised the five thousand pounds.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alltrade.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; and I despair of success—the friend I applied to wants Miss Sutherland to join.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worry.</SPEAKER>
<P>She join! why she's as poor—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alltrade.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know—but he says she has rich re∣lations—may have a handsome legacy—in short, it will mend the security:—therefore let Sir Hervey know this, and he will see the necessity of com∣manding her to sign instantly.</P>
<STAGE>(WORRY <HI>is going.</HI>)</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Dazzle.</SPEAKER>
<P>Good day, Worry—I shall be al∣ways glad to see you: and because there's a hatch∣ment over my door, don't fancy this is absolutely the house of mourning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worry.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, ma'am;—I—I—</P>
<STAGE>(laughing and try∣ing to conceal it).</STAGE>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Dazzle.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, what do you laugh at?—speak out—you won't offend me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worry.</SPEAKER>
<P>Shan't I, ma'am?—then begging your pardon, you need'nt have caution'd me; for I al∣ways look on a hatchment outside of a widow's house like a sign over an inn—a certain emblem of revelry and good cheer.—And when I'm a widower—oh! oh! oh!</P>
<STAGE>(shakes his head, sighs, and exit)</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alltrade.</SPEAKER>
<P>So far, so well; he's in our interest—but to get this bond out of Sir Hervey's hands, we must at least advance a few hundreds, and where to raise even those—for my part I haven't a guinea.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="11" REF="14"/>

<P>Nor I now a shilling!— <STAGE>(sighing)</STAGE> nor do I know where to raise one?</P>

<P>What! the quondam silversmith of Cheapside!—he's an old friend of mine,</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Dazzle,</SPEAKER>
<P>Is he?—then you may aid my suit.—You must know, smitten with the love of same, eager to acquire the reputation of wit and genius, I have written a most magnificent play, which of course I am all anxiety to see acted; he has already promised to come and read it, and if it meets with his approbation, very likely he may advance the money necessary to pay Sir Hervey.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alltrade.</SPEAKER>
<P>True—suppose I hasten his visit—I'll seek him instantly; and whilst you keep Juliana out of sight, I'll keep the will out of sight— <STAGE>(put∣ting will in his pocket).</STAGE>—And with regard to the play, if you get money by it, depend on't you'll get reputation also; one generally follows the other.</P>

<P>So it does—and how the case is alter'd?—formerly wits had no money, and now he that has no money has no wit; for whilst a bad joke will be applauded from the head of a great able, a good one will be lost if spoken by him who has nothing but wit to recommend him!—but away to the manager—let the war begin, and doubt not our victory!</P>

<P>Pooh—I'll sit there picking my teeth no longer;—stay for ever, there won't be a place taken; for well as Mr. Mist might understand conducting a shop, he knows so little how to manage a theatre, that during the time I have been prompter, treasurer, box-book-keeper, and deputy manager, there have been only three boxes taken—and they were by particular friends, who thought they did him an honour by coming in with orders—psha!—I'll go—heh?—who's here?—aha? a flat at last!</P>

<P>Yes, Sir: and between you and me, 'tis high time he came; we play to shocking houses—last night to Hamlet we were obliged to make a shew, by shoving the band into the pit, the orange women into the boxes, and the door-keepers into the galleries.—Indeed no wonder at it, for Mr. Mist himself played Hamlet.</P>

<P>Elope with Lavish, why this out∣does her mother:—but can I stand idly by?—no—I'll disappoint my enemy of this unmanly triumph, and save her; spite of herself I'll save her—Mr. Alltrade, wait upon him instantly, and bid him restore my daughter on pain of a second and more desperate meeting.—Come, madam, we'll see him on his way.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SCENE</HI>—An Apartment in <HI>LAVISH</HI>'s House—Recess with small Folding Doors, which are thrown open, and discover a Marble Pedestal surrounded by Doves and Cupids—a Table with Wine and Refreshments upon it.</HEAD>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> FRANK <HI>and a</HI> Workman.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha! ha! so you've no sooner finish∣ed that whimsical out-of-the-way job <STAGE>(pointing to the recess)</STAGE>—than he sends for you about another.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Workman.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, your master is an excellent cus∣tomer,—always up to his chin in brick and mor∣tar; and then for price—'gad! he never haggles about price.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, and the best of the joke is, he calls himself an economist, and comes down here on a saving scheme.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Workman.</SPEAKER>
<P>A saving scheme!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay! finding himself a little out of elbows in London, and the present state of the Continent not allowing him to travel, he came here to
<PB N="32" REF="35"/>live cheap, and retrench.—And there! <STAGE>(pointing to recess again)</STAGE>—there's one specimen of his economy.—On the journey he bought a statue of Venus.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Workman.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know; and a great bargain it was: it only cost him five pounds.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>True; but not choosing to have his beauties gazed at, he employed you to build that strange sort of recess to put it in, which has cost him at least five times the sum.—This is always the way; if he bought a cheap boat, he'd cut a canal for it; and if a pulpit, he'd build a church for it:—in fact, he is a false economist—a self-deceiver; and here he comes to elucidate my description.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> LAVISH.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lavish.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! if I go on in this close saving way only six months longer, I shall be able to return to town and dash like the best of them:—never was such a hand at buying bargains.—Frank, come here you rogue:—just now, at Squire Brozier's sale, what do you think I gave for a curricle? — only forty pounds! — there, there's economy for you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>Economy!—begging your pardon, Sir,—I see no economy in buying what you don't want.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lavish.</SPEAKER>
<P>How?—would you let a bargain flip through your fingers, you extravagant rascal?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>No—but you've no horses, Sir; and a curricle's useless—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lavish.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's what I said; says I, a curricle is useless without horses,—so I bought a pair di∣rectly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>Bought a pair?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="33" REF="36"/>
<SPEAKER>Lavish.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, gave a hundred and twenty pounds for them—to be sure it's money; but one's own carriage saves posting and drivers: in short, the worst come to the worst, 'tis but a hundred and fifty pounds, and I'll save it a thousand ways.—Who are you, Sir?</P>
<STAGE>(to Workman.)</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Workman.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have finish'd that job, all but fixing up the statue, Sir; and now I come about the billiard-room:—but, to speak honestly, it is not worth repairing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lavish.</SPEAKER>
<P>So I thought; I thought it wasn't worth repairing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Workman.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Sir; and a new room will not cost above three hundred pounds:—but then to be sure it will be elegant and lasting.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lavish.</SPEAKER>
<P>So it will, and the first expence is the least; so up with the new room.— <STAGE>(Workman exit.)</STAGE>—And now to finish my vindication to Juliana— <STAGE>(Sits at the table and writes):</STAGE>— <Q>Your late mo∣ther was not only my relation, but my friend and benefactress; and on Sir Hervey's one day reprobating her conduct with unusual asperity, gratitude prompted me to defend it perhaps more warmly than I ought, and a duel was the result.</Q>— <STAGE>(Knocking at the door.)</STAGE>—See who's there.— <STAGE>(FRANK <HI>exit.</HI>)</STAGE>—But what signifies writing? while she's immured in her present den, I haven't a chance of success.—Mrs. Dazzle formerly se∣duced me into some gallantries, and a disappointed widow is the devil.</P>

<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I beg pardon for laughing; but who do you think is at the door?—no less a gentleman

</SP>
<SP>

<P>Chaise and four!—is this the way to re∣trench?—and consider, Sir, Miss Sutherland has no money; and you always said you'd never marry any woman who had less than ten thousand pounds.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lavish.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did: but that's an aukward sum: a woman with ten thousand pounds expects houses, horses, carriages—in short, to spend double her own income, and her husband's too. But a woman without a farthing; she manages the house, mends the linen, nurses the children, scolds the servants—Oh! that's the real rich wife—and the poor Ju∣liana will be the best bargain I ever made.—So go, do as I tell you: and observe, I'll marry her if I sacrifice my whole fortune in the pursuit.</P>

He, like the rest of the world, won't visit virtue in a cottage, but place me in a magnificent house,—ay, there's the secret:—now-a-days people visit the building, not the owner of it; and on the size of the rooms, and the number of the enter∣tainments, we may not only calculate our friends and admirers, but also the good and bad opinion of the whole fashionable world!</P>

<SPEAKER>Worry.</SPEAKER>
<P>Bless you, I'm of no consequence; nobody ever wants me:—if any body leaves a card, it's for Mrs. Worry:—if any body sends an invi∣tation, it's for Mrs. Worry:—if an invitation is sent in return, it's still Mrs. Worry: nobody calls or asks after the husband, except indeed the trades∣people!—they are kind enough now and then to notice me: but like other great married men, I'm obliged to be out when they call: so, curse me if I've even the pleasure of being at home to a dun! but we waste time, let us proceed to Mr. Mist's house.</P>

<P>I was: but I fancy my courage is more like a new acquaintance than an old friend,—pro∣fesses a great deal at first, but generally sneaks off in the hour of danger: however, lead on—and let us hope to receive from strangers that protection which friends have denied us.</P>

<P>No:—she's not in the house I grant you; but the chaise! the chaise and four!—pray, most economical Captain, do you usually travel with four horses?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lavish.</SPEAKER>
<P>Always:—it's by far the cheapest plan: it shortens the journey, saves stopping at inns; in short, the additional shilling is no object, and if I had but ten pounds a-year, I'd always travel with four horses:—and now, my dear widow, allow me to see you home.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Very likely, Sir: but if you have no rival in an old woman, as you please to call me, I fancy Miss Sutherland has! when I listened at the door, I'll swear I heard the widow's voice.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Hervey.</SPEAKER>
<P>How?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lavish.</SPEAKER>
<P>No: dying is certainly a cheap mode of living, and to a man in desperate circumstances, a duel may be a good saving scheme: but having hoarded enough to make life comfortable, why I'm a curst fool if I don't save it a thousand ways.</P>
<STAGE>(Sits down).</STAGE>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Hervey.</SPEAKER>
<P>Poor, paltry prevarication!—Re∣member, Mr. Lavish, we were once friends—I treated you as a son—you esteemed me as a parent—and what dissolved that friendship?—you chose to vin∣dicate the honour of a false wife, and call me to the field—did I not come?</P>

<P>You did, Sir.</P>

<PB N="44" REF="47"/>
<SPEAKER>Sir Hervey.</SPEAKER>
<P>And now where is your consistency?—you would bring my daughter to the same de∣graded state; you would reduce her to the level of her mother; and when an injured father asks for satisfaction, you refuse to give it him—what is this but cowardice? plain unequivocal cowardice!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lavish.</SPEAKER>
<P>Cowardice! ill as Miss Sutherland has treated me, I never meant to raise my arm against her father:—but when you allude to the memory of her I owe such obligations to, and say I would reduce her daughter to the same degraded state—'tis past bearing—I can't endure it! and you may shoot me as soon as you please.</P>

<P>Excuse me, Sir—your innocence on the present occasion will not do away former in∣juries; nor will Mrs. Dazzle's bad conduct be an apology for my daughter's.—No!—whilst I thought love the cause of her elopement, it was my duty to pursue and save her:—but since I see self-interest is the motive, and that she fled to avoid signing an instrument which would have saved me from dis∣grace,

<P>No! whose is it then, Sir?</P>

<P>Never.—What has it afforded me? days of distress, and nights of fever and disgrace: borrowing one day, to pay double the next; flying to the gaming-table—sacrificing fortune, health, honour—and for what?—to appear fashion∣able; to make a false display of wealth; and fritter away life in the society of knaves I detest, and fools I despise.—Call you this happiness?—No, 'tis de∣speration, 'tis delirium!</P>

<P>I did—but what has this to do with—</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Every thing.—Let the marriage take place, and I, in the character of husband, can ex∣ecute the bond myself. Then these debts will be discharged, and all go well again. Come, though you say you don't dislike a prison, I am too much your friend to see you put to the trial.</P>

<P>No; but I might have lived honor∣ably; I might have lived within my income; that is the barrier no man of true honour ever passes: and if stealing on the highway be punished with death, why should the more refined robber, who defrauds the industrious tradesman of the hard earnings by which he is to support his family, why should he escape?—Oh! let no man boast the proud name of gentleman, who contracts debts he cannot pay!—But I attend you—lead on—and yet—Distraction!—William!</P>

<P>What can he mean!—I'll follow him, and have the matter explained instantly—and don't fancy to escape, Miss Juliana; for Sir Hervey shall come himself and enforce his consent; and if that fails,—the bond—look to the bond—Oh, you may smile, Sir <STAGE>(<HI>to</HI> LAVISH),</STAGE> but you'll find re∣venge is still in my power.</P>

<P>You hear, Miss Sutherland; and to avoid the danger with which you are threatened take my advice and be beforehand with them.—Fly to your father—throw yourself at his feet—en∣treat his protection—</P>

<P>I will; there is no other hope—go where I will, they still pursue and persecute me.—Yes! I'll to my father!</P>

<P>Come then—allow me to conduct you—and if I too throw myself at his feet, and he no longer thinks me his enemy—</P>

<SPEAKER>Juliana.</SPEAKER>
<P>Alas! even then, Mr. Lavish—con∣sider. I am so destitute of every hope of fortune—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lavish.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fortune! oh, if that's all the difficulty, it's only to lessen our expences—to live on a narrow scale:—instead of a house in Grosvenor-square, we must be content with one in Grosvenor-street:—instead of four horses, we must drive only a pair:—and to avoid gaming and giving great enter∣tainments, we must go every night to the play or the opera.—But come—and though thus far I shall stint you, my dear Juliana, in every other respect I'll indulge you to the last shilling—I will, if I save it a thousand ways!</P>

<SPEAKER>Sir Hervey.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, Sir; time was, when friend∣ship wore a bold and open aspect, and as it spoke
<PB N="70" REF="73"/>it acted: but now 'tis masked; and underneath it lurks all modern villany. Who betrayed my wife? a friend!—who belied my child? a friend!—who immured her in a gaol, and if she does not prostitute her hand and heart, will see her pe∣rish there—who, but my friend!—Can my enemy thus injure me?—No; in him I place no confi∣dence or trust; and henceforth let me rather meet a thousand foes than the designing arts of one false friend.</P>

<P>No, Sir; my hopes are vanished, I find here the fortune is conditional:—if my daughter marries, it devolves to Mrs. Dazzle.</P>

<P>If she marries?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Hervey.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, Sir!—while she remains single, she may roll in affluence, and I be restored to all my former splendor;—but will that give either of us con∣solation? No; my own sad example has taught me the reverse; and therefore, mark me, Juliana—I wish to make atonement, to give you fixed, un∣ceasing happiness;—and having proved myself un∣fit to guard so dear a charge,—let him who best deserves, let him protect you!</P>

<P>Him!—Ac∣cept her, Mr. Lavish,—take her as the best re∣compence for all the wrongs I've done you.—Nay, I know the penalty:—I know, by marrying you she forfeits this estate; and for your sake I wish it had accompanied her; but for my own!—at last
<PB N="72" REF="75"/>I've acted as a parent ought, and though these gates are ever shut against me, I know my daugh∣ter's happy, and that thought will give what wealth can never purchase;—a quiet conscience and un∣bròken rest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lavish.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir Hervey, you have acted nobly—but—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Hervey.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what?—You are sufficiently affluent to maintain her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lavish.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; there's the curse on't: I thought I had saved a fortune;—but just now, when I heard of your mutual distress, and drew bills on my steward and my banker, they refused payment;—to my astonishment they said I hadn't a shil∣ling!—there you see, there's the end of my econo∣my!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Hervey.</SPEAKER>
<P>And you'd have paid my debts—you'd have released your enemy?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lavish.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, that I would, if I'd saved it a thou∣sand ways;—but to marry on such conditions!—No—I'll die first.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Juliana.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so will I; and hard as it is, here let us separate, Mr. Lavish.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Hervey.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never!—never shall you be divided!—and though we can expect no liberality from Mrs. Dazzle, yet under all the circumstances she may be induced to compromise—perhaps allow us a moiety, or a third.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lavish.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, or any thing,—if she'll only allow us two hundred a-year, with my management I'll be bound we'll all live comfortably;—I'll go make her proposals instantly, and don't fear my success;—for at a bargain,—never was such a fellow at making a bargain.</P>
</SP>

<P>Adieu, Mr. Lavish; pray Heaven you may succeed!</P>
</SP>

<P>So say I: and if she don't come to an amicable adjustment, contest the will, and employ my nephew to file a bill in Chancery against her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>No, that will never do: rather give up the whole property than go to law.—Come, that's good economy, or the devil's in it.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Dazzle.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; my marriage with Mr. Mist makes me sufficiently rich and independent to re∣fuse the paltry offer; and I can now shew the world that I'm above being a party in so infamous a transaction! so I wish you a pleasant tour to Italy, good Signor Lavishini.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lavish.</SPEAKER>
<P>You're wrong! it's a mighty pretty in∣come:—I'd be bound to keep a carriage on two hundred a-year.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Dazzle.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very likely: but you have your answer, Sir.</P>

<P>Yes: Miss Suther∣land's heiress!—Mr. Squib Manager.</P>

<SPEAKER>Stopgap</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(<HI>aside to</HI> MIST).</STAGE>
<P>I have a thought, Sir! rhaps Miss Sutherland may wish to sell—and through Mr. Squib's interest, and by securing him the deputyship—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I may get purchase! well prompted, Stop—we'll pay court to new monarch;—now mind, one of best benefit bows.—</P>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. Dazzle</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(turning him round).</STAGE>
<P>Why, Mr. Mist, I'm on this side.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know! but I am on the other side: a good Manager always goes with the ruling party:—any reparation to you or the heiress, Mr. Squib! would she choose the freedom? or you take a be∣nefit?—play myself, and give you first night of new pantomime.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lavish.</SPEAKER>
<P>You see, Signora, you see!—why if you're in earnest, Mr. Mist, Miss Sutherland's fa∣ther is in prison, and as this Will gives him no ready money—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I take—what's the debt?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lavish.</SPEAKER>
<P>A trifle!—but a thousand pounds, which in the course of a month I can save and repay you!—or if that security don't content you, you shall have a mortgage on the theatre.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mist.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's it; that's the best security on earth! far better than meadows and corn fields!—people will go without bread, but, bless 'em! never with∣out plays!—Come along, Stop—prison only next door—gaoler take my word:—re enter with Sir Hervey instantly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Dazzle.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, are you mad, Sir?—will you again disappoint and deceive me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Deceive you!—hem!—who concealed will?—passed off for Manager, and turns out only author?—who under false pretences would have pocketed all my scenes, dresses, and decorations?—No, no—you deceived me; and therefore, <Q>Mary, once more I follow thee! and so, Good morrow, good Queen Elizabeth!</Q></P>

<P>Excuse me!—I'm above being a party in so infamous a transaction.</P>

<P>Nay: when you consider the smallness of the sum, and that I bind myself to give up all claim under my husband's will:—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lavish.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, that's true; and seriously speaking two hundred a-year is no object; and therefore, I'll indulge you?—sign directly, and I'll indulge you!</P>

<P>The sooner the better!—I long to be out of the monster's house!—here's pen and ink.</P>

<P>How! your wife!</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lavish.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay; you thought I'd call her by another name; but I am still old fashioned enough to think the word "wife," heightens happiness and gives a zest to love!— <STAGE>(Mrs. DAZZLE <HI>is going to speak</HI>)</STAGE>—Nay, don't blame me!—you have to thank yourself for the whole transaction; and when any body makes false charges, I hope I shall be al∣ways too good an economist not to make them pay for them.</P>

<HEAD>EPILOGUE, WRITTEN BY GEORGE COLMAN, ESQ.</HEAD>
<SP>
<STAGE><HI>Spoken by Mr.</HI> FAWCETT <HI>in the Character of</HI> MIST.</STAGE>
<LG>
<L>A London Manager of high degree,</L>
<L>I, Peter Mist, now enter here O. P.;</L>
<L>My country playhouse, e'er I came to town</L>
<L>Almost knock'd up, has been in lots knock'd down.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A sturdy farmer bought the walls:—why then,</L>
<L>What was a barn will be a barn again.</L>
<L>Corn on the stage, not mummers will be seen;</L>
<L>And oats be thresh'd where actors should have been;</L>
<L>Wheat strew the boards where erst did heroes tread,</L>
<L>To make—what heroes never made there—bread.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Stage-struck, but hen-peck'd, honest Justice Dunder</L>
<L>Has all my clouds,—his lady has my thunder.</L>
<L>Dick Drench, the snug apothecary, means</L>
<L>To give a private play, so buys my scenes:</L>
<L>Drench, "smelling of the shop," and <HI>idem semper,</HI></L>
<L>Could not resist scenes painted in distemper.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Member for the town bought all my coats;</L>
<L>There he was wise—for I command two votes;</L>
<L>And playhouse coats (again he shew'd discerning)</L>
<L>Will suit a Member, for they're us'd to turning.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>My wigs the women quarrell'd for, sweet souls!</L>
<L>My daggers stuck in selling; but my bowls</L>
<L>Mine host of the Red Lion clapp'd his eyes on,</L>
<L>And bought 'em, as I did, to serve up poison.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus all my country stock, as Shakspeare says,</L>
<L>"My cloud-capt towers, my gorgeous palaces,</L>
<L>"Yea, my great globe," (the barn,) so much involv'd,</L>
<L>And "all it did inherit, have dissolv'd."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="83" REF="86"/>
<L>But if some future Manager should take</L>
<L>My "solemn temple," which I now forsake;</L>
<L>My "fabric of a vision," he will find</L>
<L>That I have left a cursed "wreck behind."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Here then I come, by rural schemes half undone,</L>
<L>But country stumps appear new brooms in London.</L>
<L>Egad I'll sweep all clean—look to't—ne'er doubt me—</L>
<L>A London Manager, I'll lay about me;</L>
<L>And, as a sample, you shall hear my hints,</L>
<L>To be inserted in to-morrow's prints:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"A five act play last night was represented,</L>
<L>"By an amazing <HI>Dramatist</HI> invented!</L>
<L>"Author's and Actors' merits were immense,</L>
<L>"And Fawcett e'en surpass'd his usual excellence!</L>
<L>"Great care 'tis plain was taken in rehearsal;</L>
<L>"And"—may I add with <HI>truth?</HI>—"applause was "universal."</L>
