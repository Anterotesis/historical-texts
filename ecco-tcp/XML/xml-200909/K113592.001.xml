<P>THE Applause bestowed on the ROMAN HISTORY, written by Dr.
GOLD∣SMITH, induced that Gentleman to complete his Plan, by writing a HISTORY
OF GREECE.</P>
<P>The Work was printed off when the Re∣public of Letters was
deprived of one of its brightest Ornaments. Since the Author's Decease, the
Work has been perused by seve∣ral of his learned Friends, who are of
Opi∣nion, that it has an equal Claim to that Ap∣probation which the ROMAN
HISTORY re∣ceived from the Public.</P>

<HEAD><PB REF="4"/>THE HISTORY OF GREECE.</HEAD>
<DIV1 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I. Of the earliest State of GREECE.</HEAD>
<P>THE first notices we have of every coun∣try are fabulous and
uncertain. Among an unenlightened people every imposture is likely to take
place, for ignorance is the parent of credulity. Nothing therefore which the
Greeks have transmitted to us concerning their earliest state can be
relied on. Poets were the first who began to record the actions of their
coun∣trymen, and it is a part of their art to strike the imagination even at
the expence of proba∣bility. <PB N="2" REF="5"/> For this reason, in the
earliest accounts of Greece we are presented with the machi∣nations of gods
and demigods, the adventures of heroes and giants, the ravages of monsters
and dragons, and all the potency of charms and enchantments. Man, plain
historical man, seems to have no share in the picture, and while the
reader wanders through the most de∣lightful scenes the imagination can
offer, he is scarce once presented with the actions of such a being as
himself.</P>
<P>It would be vain therefore, and beside the present purpose, to
give an historical air to ac∣counts which were never meant to be
trans∣mitted as true. Some writers indeed have la∣boriously undertaken to
separate the truth from the fable, and to give us an unbroken narra∣tive from
the first dawning of tradition to the display of undoubted history; they
have le∣velled down all mythology to their own ap∣prehensions, every fable is
made to look with an air of probability, instead of a golden fleece Jason
goes in pursuit of a great treasure; in∣stead of destroying a chimera,
Bellerophon reclaims a mountain; instead of an hydra, Hercules overcomes a
robber.</P>
<P>Thus the fanciful pictures of a strong ima∣gination are taught to
assume a serious se∣verity, <PB N="3" REF="6"/> and tend to deceive the
reader still more by offering in the garb of truth what had been only meant
to delight and allure him.</P>
<P>The fabulous age, therefore, of Greece must have no place in
history; it is now too late to separate these parts which may have a real
foundation in nature from those which owe their existence wholly to the
imagination. There are no traces left to guide us in that intricate pursuit,
the dews of the morning are past, and it is vain to attempt continuing the
chace in meridian splendor. It will be suf∣ficient therefore for us to
observe, that Greece, like most other countries of whose origin we have
any notice, was at first divided into a number of petty states, each
commanded by its own sovereign. Ancient Greece, which is now the south part
of Turkey in Europe, was bounded on the east by the Egean sea, now called
the Archipelago; on the south by the Cretan or Candian sea; on the west
by the Ionian sea; and on the north by Illyria and Thrace. Of such very
narrow extent, and so very contemptible with regard to ter∣ritory was that
country which gave birth to all the arts of war and peace, which pro∣duced the
greatest generals, philosophers, poets, painters, architects and
statuaries that the <PB N="4" REF="7"/> world ever boasted, which overcame
the most powerful monarchs, and dispersed the most numerous armies that
ever were brought into the field, and at last became the instructor of all
mankind.</P>
<P>It is said in scripture that Javan, the son of Japeth, was the
father of all these nations that went under the general denomination of
Greeks. Of his four sons, Elisha, or Ellas is said to have given name to
the <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, a ge∣neral name by which the
Greeks were known. Tharsis, the second son, is thought to have settled
in Achaia; Chittim settled in Macedo∣nia; and Dodanim, the fourth, son in
Thessaly and Epirus. How they portioned out the country, what revolutions
they experienced, or what wars they maintained are utterly un∣known, and indeed
the history of petty bar∣barous states, if known, would hardly re∣compence
the trouble of enquiry. In those early times, kingdoms were but
inconsider∣able: a single city with a few leagues of land was often
honoured with that magnificent ap∣pellation; it would therefore embarrass
history to enter into the domestic privacy of every little state, as it
would be rather a subject for the oeconomist than the politician. It will
suffice to observe, that Sicyon is said to be the <PB N="5" REF="8"/>
most ancient kingdom of Greece. The begin∣ing of this petty sovereignty is
placed by histo∣rians in the year of the world one thousand nine hundred
and fifteen, before Jesus Christ two thousand eighty-nine, and before the
first Olympiad one thousand three hundred and thirteen. The first king
was Aegialeus. Its duration is said to have been a thousand years.</P>
<P>The kingdom of Argos, in Peloponesus, be∣gan a thousand and
eighty years before the first Olympiad, in the time of Abraham. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. M. 2148.</NOTE> The first king was
Inachus.</P>
<P>The kingdom of Mycaenae succeeded. The seat of government was
translated thither from Argos by Perseus, the grandson of Acrisius, the
last king of that country, who Perseus un∣fortunately slew. The kings who
reigned at Mycaenae after Perseus, were Electryon, Sthe∣nelus, and
Eurystheus; the latter of whom was driven out by the Heraclidae, or the
descen∣dants of Hercules, who made themselves mas∣ters of
Peloponnesus.</P>
<P>The kingdom of Athens was first founded by Cecrops, an Egyptian. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. M. 2448.</NOTE> This prince hav∣ing settled
in Attica, divided the whole country subject to him into twelve districts,
and also established a court for judging causes, entitled 
<PB N="6" REF="9"/> the Areopagus. Amphictyon, the third king of Athens,
procured a confederacy among the twelve states of Greece, which assembled
twice a year at Thermopylae, there to offer up common sacrifices, and to
consult for the common inte∣rest of the association. Theseus, one of
the succeeding kings of this state, united the twelve boroughs of Cecrops
into one city. Codrus was the last of this line who devoted himself to
death for his people. The Heraclidae having made an irruption as far as the
gates of Athens, the oracle declared, that they should be con∣querors whose
king should fall in this contest. To take the earliest advantage,
therefore, of this answer, Codrus disguised himself in the habit of a
peasant, and provoking one of the enemies soldiers, was killed by him.
Where∣upon, the Athenians sent an herald to demand the body of their king,
which message struck such a damp into the enemy, that they depart∣ed
without striking another blow. After Cod∣rus the title of king was
extinguished among the Athenians. Medon, his son, was set at the head of
the commonwealth, with the title of Archon, which signifies chief governor.
The first of this denomination had their places for life, but the Athenians
growing weary of a go∣vernment which represt their love of freedom, 
<PB N="7" REF="10"/> they abridged the terms of the archon's power to ten years,
and at last made the office elective every year.</P>
<P>The kingdom of Thebes was first founded by Cadmus. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. M. 2549.</NOTE> This hero coming by sea from
the coast of Phoenicia, settled in that part of the country which was
afterwards called Baeotia. He there built the city of Thebes, which from his
own name he called Cadmaea, and there fixed his seat of power and dominion.
The adventures of his unhappy posterity, Laius, Jocasta, Oedipus, Eteocles,
and Polynices, make a shining figure among the poetical fictions of that
period.</P>
<P>The kingdom of Sparta, or Lacedaemon, is supposed to be first
instituted by Leliae. He∣lena, the tenth in succession from this
monarch, is equally famous for her beauty and infidelity. She had not lived
above three years with her husband, Menelaus, before she was carried off by
Paris, the son of Priam king of Troy. This seems to be the first
occasion in which the Greeks united in one common cause. The Greeks took
Troy after a ten years siege, much about the time that Jeptha was the judge
in Israel.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A. M. 2820.</NOTE> Corinth began later than the
other cities above-mentioned to be formed into a state, or <PB N="8" REF="11"/> to be governed by its kings. It was at first subject to Argos and
Mycaenae, but Sisiphus, the son of Aeolus, made himself master of it; 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. M. 2628.</NOTE> and when his descendants were
dispossessed, Bachis assumed the reins of power. The government
after this became aristocratical, a chief magi∣strate being annually
chosen by the name of Prytanni. At last Cypselus having gained the
people, usurped the supreme authority, which he transmitted to his son
Periander, who was ranked among the seven wise men of Greece, from the love
he bore to learning, and his en∣couragement of its professors.</P>
<P>The kingdom of Macedonia was first go∣verned by Caranus,
descended from Hercules, and subsisted from his time till the defeat of
Perseus by the Romans, a space of six hundred and twenty-six years.</P>
<P>Such is the picture Greece offers in its earliest infancy. A
combination of little states, each go∣verned by its respective sovereign,
yet all uniting for their mutual safety and general advantage. Still,
however, their intestine contentions were carried on with great animosity;
and, as it hap∣pens in all petty states under the dominion of a single
commander, the jealousies of the princes were a continual cause of
discord. From this distressful situation, those states, 
<PB N="9" REF="12"/> by degrees, began to emerge: a different spirit began to
seize the people, and, sick of the contentions of their princes, they
desired to be free. A spirit of liberty prevail∣ed all over Greece, and a
general change of government was effected in every part of the country except
in Macedonia. Thus monar∣chy gave way to a republican government, which,
however, was diversified into as many various forms as there were different
cities, according to the different genius and peculiar character of each
people.</P>
<P>All these cities, though seemingly diffe∣rent from each other in
their laws and in∣terests, were united with each other by one common
language, one religion, and a nation∣al pride that taught them to consider
all other nations as barbarous and feeble. Even Egypt itself, from whence
they had derived many of their arts and institutions, was considered in a
very subordinate light, and rather as an half barbarous predecessor, than
an enlightened rival.</P>
<P>To make this union among the states of Greece still stronger,
there were games insti∣tuted in different parts of the country, with re∣wards
for excellence in every pursuit. These sports were instituted for very
serious and use∣ful <PB N="10" REF="13"/> purposes; they afforded an
opportunity for the several states meeting together; they gave them a
greater zeal for their common religion; they exercised the youth for the
purposes of war, and increased that vigour and activity which was then of
the utmost importance in de∣ciding the fate of a battle.</P>
<P>But their chief bond of union arose from the council of the
Amphictyons, which was insti∣tuted by Amphictyon, king of Athens, as is
al∣ready mentioned, and was appointed to be held twice a year at Thermopylae,
to deliberate for the general good of those states of whose deputies it
was composed. The states who sent deputies to this council, were twelve,
namely, the Thessalians, the Thebans, the Dorians, the Ionians, the
Perhaabeans, the Magnates, the Locrians, the Oetans, the Pthiotes, the Maleans,
the Phocians, and the Dolopians. Each of those cities which had a right to
assist at the Amphictyonic council, was obliged to send two deputies to
every meeting. The one was intitled the Hieromnemon, who took care of the
interests of religion; the other was called the Pylagoras, and had in charge
the civil interests of his community. Each of these deputies, however,
differing in their functions, enjoyed an equal power of determining all
af∣fairs <PB N="11" REF="14"/> relative to the general interests of Greece.
But, although the number of deputies seems to have been settled originally
so as to answer the number of votes which each city was allow∣ed, yet in
process of time, on some extraordi∣nary occasions, the principal cities
assumed a power of sending more than one Pylagoras to assist in a
critical emergency, or to serve the purposes of a faction. When the
deputies, thus appointed, appeared to execute their com∣mission, after
offering up sacrifices to Apollo, Diana, Latona, and Minerva, they took an
oath, implying, that they would never subvert any city of the Amphictyons,
never stop the course of waters either in war or peace, and that they would
oppose any attempts to lessen the reverence and authority of the gods, to
whom they had paid their adoration. Thus, all offences against religion, all
instances of impiety and profanation, all contests between the Grecian
states and cities came under the particular cognizance of the Amphictyons,
who had a right to determine, to impose fines, and even to levy forces, and
to make war against those who offered to rebel against their sove∣reign
authority.</P>
<P>These different motives to confederacy unit∣ed the Greeks for a
time into a body of great <PB N="12" REF="15"/> power, and greater emulation. By
this associa∣tion, a country not half so large as England, was able to
dispute the empire of the earth with the most powerful monarchs of the
world. By this association, they not only made head against the numerous
armies of Persia, but dis∣persed, routed and destroyed them, reducing
their pride so low, as to make them submit to conditions of peace as
shameful to the con∣quered as glorious to the conquerors. But among all the
cities of Greece, there were two that by their merit, their valour, and their
wisdom, particularly distinguished themselves from the rest: these
were Athens and Lace∣daemon. As these cities served as an example of
bravery or learning to the rest, and as the chief burthen of every foreign
war devolved upon them, it will be proper to enter into their particular
history with greater minuteness, and to give the reader some idea of the
genius, character, manners, and government of their respective
inhabitants.</P>

<PB N="13" REF="16"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. II. Of the Government of SPARTA, and the Laws of
LYCURGUS.</HEAD>
<P>ALTHOUGH the kingdom of Lacedae∣mon was not so considerable as
that of Athens, yet as it was of much earlier institution, it de∣mands our
first attention. Lacedaemon, as observed above, was in the beginning
govern∣ed by kings, of which thirteen held the reins of power in
succession, of the race of the Pe∣lopidae. As during this dark interval
there were no fixed laws to limit the prerogative, nor no ideas of true
government among the people, it does not appear that there were any
considerable encroachments made either on the side of the king or that of
the people. Under the race of the Heraclidae, who succeeded, in∣stead of
one king, the people admitted two, who governed with equal authority. The
cause of this change seems to have sprung from a very particular
accident; for Aristodemus dying, left two sons, Eurysthenes and Procles,
twins, so much alike, that it was hardly possible to dis∣tinguish 
<PB N="14" REF="17"/> them asunder. From hence the hint was taken by the
mother of fixing the crown upon both; so that when the Spartans came for a
king, she was either unwilling or un∣able to decide which of them was
first-born, or which had the justest pretensions. This form of
government continued for several suc∣ceeding centuries, and though the one
was almost ever at variance with his associate on the throne, yet the
government remained en∣tire.</P>
<P>It was during this succession that slavery was first
instituted in Sparta. Erysthenes and Procles having granted the countrymen
of Sparta the same privileges with the citizens, Agis reversed what his
predecessors had done in favour of the peasants, and imposed a tri∣bute
upon them. The Helotes were the only people that would not acquiesce in this
im∣post, but rose in rebellion to vindicate their rights: the citizens
however prevailed, the Helotes were subdued and made prisoners of war. As a
still greater punishment, they and their posterity were condemned to
perpetual slavery; and, to encrease their miseries still more, all
other slaves were called by the ge∣neral name of Helotes.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="18"/> It would appear from hence that this little
state was governed with turbulence and op∣pression, and required the curb
of severe laws and rigorous discipline. These severities and ri∣gorous
discipline were at last imposed upon it by Lycurgus, one of the first
and most ex∣traordinary legislators that ever appeared among mankind. There
is perhaps nothing more remarkable in prophane history, yet nothing so well
attested, as what relates to the laws and government of Lycurgus. What indeed
can be more amazing than to behold a mutinous and savage race of mankind
yield∣ing submission to laws that controuled every sensual pleasure
and every private affection; to behold them give up, for the good of the
state, all the comforts and conveniencies of private life, and making a
state of domestic privacy more severe and terrible than the most
painful campaigns and the most warlike du∣ties. Yet all this was effected by
the perse∣verance and authority of a single legislator, who gave the
first lessons of hard resignation in his own generous example.</P>
<P>Lycurgus was the son of Eunomus, one of the two kings who reigned
together in Sparta. The two kings dying without apparent issue, the right
of succession rested in Lycurgus, <PB N="16" REF="19"/> who accordingly
took the administration upon him. But an unexpected event came to in∣terrupt
his promotion; for the queen his sister-in-law proving with child, his
right became doubtful. A man of less probity would have used every
precaution to secure himself upon the throne, and a proposal which was
made him by the queen seemed to secure his pre∣tensions. She offered to
destroy the birth, upon condition that he would marry her, and take her into
a share of power. Lycurgus wisely smothered his resentment at so
unnatural a proposal, and fearful that she might use means to put her
project in execution, assured her that as soon as the child was born he
would take upon himself to remove it out of the way. Accordingly she was
delivered of a boy, which Lycurgus commanded should be brought to him, as he
was at supper with the magistrates; to them he presented the child as
their king, and to testify his own and the people's joy, gave him the name of
Charilaus. Thus Lycurgus sacrificed his ambition to his duty; and still
more, continued his regency, not as king but governor. However, dread∣ing the
resentment of the queen, and finding the state in great disorder, he
resolved by travelling to avoid the dangers of the one, <PB N="17" REF="20"/>
and to procure a remedy for the defects of the other.</P>
<P>Thus resolving to make himself acquainted with all the
improvements of other nations, and to consult the most experienced
persons he could meet with in the art of government, he began with the
island of Crete, whose hard and severe laws were very much admired. In
this island the handicraft trades were brought to some degree of
perfection. There they wrought in copper and iron, and made ar∣mour, in which
they danced with a confused noise of bells at the sacrifices of their
gods. It was from them that the art of navigation was first known in Greece,
and from them many legislators derived the principles of their respective
institutions.</P>
<P>From Crete Lycurgus passed over into Asia, where he still
found new information, and is said to have first made the discovery of
the works of Homer. From thence he went into Egypt, and is said by some to
have had con∣serences with the gymnosophists of India. But whilst thus
employed abroad, his presence be∣gan to be greatly wanted at home. All
par∣ties conspired to wish his coming, and many messages were sent to
hasten his return. The kings themselves importuned him to that effect, 
<PB N="18" REF="21"/> and let him know, that the people were arriv∣ed at such
a pitch of disorder that nothing but his authority could controul their
licentiousness. In fact, every thing tended to the unavoidable
destruction of the state, and nothing but his presence was wished to
check its encreasing dis∣solution.</P>
<P>Lycurgus, at length persuaded to return, found the people wearied
out with their own importunities, and ready to receive any new impressions
he might attempt. Wherefore the corruption being general, he found it
necessary to change the whole form of the government; sensible that a
few particular laws would pro∣duce no great effect. But considering the
ef∣ficacy of religion in promoting every new insti∣tution, he went first to
consult the oracle of Apollo at Delphos, where he met a reception that might
flatter his highest ambition, for he was saluted by the priestless as a
friend of the gods, and rather as a god than man. As to his new institution
also, he was told that the gods heard his prayers, and that the common∣wealth
he was going to establish would be the most excellent and durable upon
earth.</P>
<P>Thus encouraged, on his return to Sparta, Lycurgus first
communicated his designs to his particular friends, and then by degrees
gain∣ed <PB N="19" REF="22"/> over the leading men to his party, until things
being ripe for a change, he ordered thirty of the principal men to appear armed
in the market-place. Charilaus, who was at that time king, seemed at first
willing to oppose this revolution, but being intimidated by a su∣perlor
force, he took shelter in the temple of Minerva; where, being prevailed upon
by his subjects, and being also of a flexible temper, he came forth and
joined the confederacy. The people soon acquiesced under a set of
insti∣tutions which were evidently calulated for their improvement, and
gladly acknowledged submission to laws which leaned with equal weight
upon every rank of society.</P>
<P>To continue the KINGS still with a shadow of power, he confirmed
them in their right of succession as before, but diminished their
autho∣rity by instituting a senate, which was to serve as a
counterpoise between the prerogative and the people. They still, however,
had all their former marks of outward dignity and respect. They had the chief
seats in every public assem∣bly; in voting they were allowed first to
give their opinion; they received ambassadors and strangers, and
overlooked public buildings and highways. In the field they were
possess∣ed of greater power, they conducted the armies 
<PB N="20" REF="23"/> of the state, and were attended by judges,
field-deputies, and a general of the horse. However, they were not entirely
at liberty even in war, as they received their orders from the senate, which,
though for the most part discretionary, yet they were sometimes forced to
march against the enemy, or to return home when they least desired to
retreat.</P>
<P>The government hitherto had been un∣steady, tending at one time
time towards despo∣tism, at another to democracy, but the SENATE
instituted by Lycurgus served as a check upon both, and kept the state
balanced in tranquility. This body, which was composed of twenty-eight
members, founded their chief policy in siding with the kings when the people
were grasping at too much power; and, on the other hand, in espousing the
interests of the people whenever the kings attempted to carry their authority
too far. The senators, who were composed of those who assisted
Lycurgus in his designs, as well as of several of the ci∣tizens remarkable
for their private virtues, but none were eligible till sixty years of age.
They were continued for life, except upon any noto∣rious crime; and this, as it
prevented the in∣conveniencies of too frequent a change, so it was a
lasting reward to the old, and a noble <PB N="21" REF="24"/> incentive to the
young. These formed the supreme court of judicature; and though there lay
an appeal from them to the people, yet as they were only convened at the
pleasure of the senate, and as the senators were not responsible for
any wrong judgment, their decrees general∣ly past without a repeal. Indeed,
for several ages, such was the caution, and such the in∣tegrity of this
tribunal, that none seemed de∣sirous of seeking farther justice, and
both par∣ties acquiesced in the justice of their decree. However, the great
power which the senate was thus possessed of, was about a century
after tempered by the erection of a superior court, called the court of the
EPHORI, which consisted of but five in number, and the members were
chosen annually into their osfice. They were elected from the people, and
had a power of ar∣resting and imprisoning even the persons of their
kings, if they acted unbecoming their station.</P>
<P>The PEOPLE also had a nominal share in the government. They had
their assemblies con∣sisting of citizens only, and also their great
con∣vention of all persons who were free of the state. But this power of
convening was but a mere mat∣ter of form, as the senate alone was permitted
to call them together, and as it was in the option of that body to dismiss
them at pleasure. The <PB N="22" REF="25"/> subject of deliberation also
was to be of their proposal, while the people, denied the privilege of
debating or discussing, could only reject or ratify with laconic
decision. To keep them still more helpless, they were left out of all
of∣fices of the state, and were considered merely as machines, which their
wiser fellow-citizens were to conduct and employ.</P>
<P>So small a degree of power granted to the people might be apt to
destroy these institutions in their infancy, but to reconcile them to the
change, Lycurgus boldly resolved to give them a share in those lands from
whence, by the encreasing riches of some, and the dissipa∣tion of
others, they had been deprived. To keep the people in plenty and dependence,
seems to have been one of the most refined strokes in this
philosopher's legislation. The generality or the people were at that time
so poor, that they were destitute of every kind of possession,
whilst a small number of indivi∣duals were possessed of all the
lands and the wealth of the country. In order, therefore, to banish the
insolence, the sraud, and the luxury of the one, as well as the misery,
the repining, and the factious despair of the others, he persuaded the
majority, and forced the rest to give up all their lands to the commonwealth,
<PB N="23" REF="26"/> and to make a new division of them that they might all
live together in perfect equality. Thus all the sensual goods of life were
equally distributed among the governors and the go∣verned, and superior
merit alone conferred su∣perior distinction.</P>
<P>Lycurgus accordingly divided all the lands of Laconia into thirty
thousand parts, and those of Sparta into nine thousand, and these he
portioned out to the respective inhabitants of each district. Each portion
was sufficient to maintain a family in that frugal manner he pro∣posed;
and, though the kings had a larger share assigned them to support their
dignity, yet their tables had rather an air of decency and competency, than of
superfluity or pro∣fusion. It is said that some years after, as
Ly∣curgus was returning from a long journey, ob∣serving how equally the corn
was divided in all parts of the country, he was heard to ob∣serve smiling
on those next him, 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>Does not La∣conia look like an estate which
several brothers have been dividing amongst them?</HI></Q></P>
<P>But it would have answered no permanent purpose to divide the
lands, if the money were still suffered to accumulate. To prevent,
therefore, all other distinction but that of me∣rit, he resolved to level
down all fortune to <PB N="24" REF="27"/> one standard. He did not indeed
strip those possessed of gold or silver of their property; but,
what was equivalent, he cried down its value, and suffered nothing but iron
money to pass in exchange for every commodity. This coin also he made so
heavy, and fixed at so low a rate, that a cart and two oxen were re∣quired to
carry home a sum of ten minas, or about twenty pounds English, and a whole
house was necessary to keep it in. This iron money had no currency among
any other of the Grecian states, who, so far from esteeming it, treated
it with the utmost contempt and ridi∣cule. From the neglect of foreigners,
the Spartans themselves began to despise it so, that money was at
last brought into disuse, and few troubled themselves with more than
was barely sufficient to supply their necessities. Thus not only
riches, but their attendant train of avarice, fraud, rapine, and luxury, were
banished from this simple state, and the people found in ignorance of
riches a happy substitute for the want of those refinements they
be∣stow.</P>
<P>But these institutions were not thought suf∣ficient to prevent
that tendency which man∣kind have to private excess. A third regula∣tion was
therefore made, commanding that all <PB N="25" REF="28"/> meals should be in
public. He ordained that all the men should eat in one common hall without
distinction; and lest strangers should attempt to corrupt his citizens
by their ex∣ample, a law was expressly made against their continuance in
the city. By these means fru∣gality was not only made necessary, but the
use of riches was at once abolished. Every man sent monthly his
provisions to the com∣mon stock, with a little money for other con∣tingent
expences. These consisted of one bu∣shel of flour, eight measures of
wine, five pounds of cheese, and two pounds and an half of figs. The tables
consisted of fifteen persons each, where none could be admitted but by
the consent of the whole company. Every one without exception of persons
was obliged to be at the common meal; and a long time af∣ter, when Agis
returned from a successful ex∣pedition, he was punished and reprimanded
for having eaten with his queen in private. The very children eat at these
meals, and were car∣ried thither as to a school of temperance and wisdom.
At these homely repasts no rude or immoral conversation was permitted, no
lo∣quacious disputes or ostentatious talking. Each endeavoured to express
his sentiments with the utmost perspicuity and conciseness; wit was 
<PB N="26" REF="29"/> admitted to season the banquet, and se∣crecy to give
it security. As soon as a young man came into the room, the oldest man in
the company used to say to him, point∣ing to the door, 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>Nothing spoken here must go that
way.</HI></Q> Black broth was their favourite dish, of what ingredients it
was made is now known, but they used no flesh in their entertainments; it
probably resembled those lenten soups which are still in use on the
con∣tinent. Dionysius, the tyrant, found their fare very unpalatable; but, as
the cook asserted, the broth was nothing without the seasoning of
fa∣tigue and hunger.</P>
<P>An injunction so rigorous, which thus cut off all the delicacies
and refinements of luxury, was by no means pleasing to the rich, who took
every occasion to insult the lawgiver upon his new regulations. The tumults
it excited were frequent; and in one of these, a young fellow whose name
was Alexander, struck out one of Lycurgus's eyes. But he had the ma∣jority of
the people on his side, who, provok∣ed at the outrage, delivered the young
man in∣to his hands to treat him with all proper se∣verity. Lycurgus,
instead of testifying any brutal resentment, won over his aggressor
by all the arts of affability and tenderness, till, at <PB N="27" REF="30"/>
last, from being one of the proudest and most turbulent men of Sparta, he
became an ex∣ample of wisdom and moderation, and an use∣ful assistant
to Lycurgus in promoting his new institutions.</P>
<P>Thus, undaunted by opposition, and steady in his designs, he
went on to make a thorough reformation in the manners of his countrymen. As the
education of youth was one of the most important objects of a legislator's
care, he took care to instil such early principles, that children should
in a manner be born with a sense of or∣der and discipline. His grand
principle was, that children were properly the possession of the
state, and belonged to the community more than to their parents. To this end
he began from the very time of their conception, making it the mother's duty to
use such diet and exercise as might fit her to produce a vigo∣rous and
healthy offspring. As during this pe∣riod, all institutions were tinctured
with the savageness of the times, it is not wonderful that Lycurgus
ordained that all such children as, upon a public view, were deemed deformed
or weakly, and unfitted for a future life of vi∣gour and fatigue, should be
exposed to perish in a cavern near mount Taygetus. This was considered as
a public punishment upon the <PB N="28" REF="31"/> mother, and it was thought
the readiest way to lighten the state of a future encumbrance.</P>
<P>Those infants that were born without any ca∣pital defects were
adopted as children of the state, and delivered to their parents to be
nurs∣ed with severity and hardship. From their tenderest age they were
accustomed to make no choice in their eating, not to be afraid in the dark,
or when left alone, not to be peevish or fretful, to walk barefoot, to lie
hard at nights, to wear the same cloaths winter and summer, and to fear
nothing from their equals. At the age of seven years they were taken from
their parents, and delivered over to the classes for a public education.
Their discipline there was little else than an apprenticeship to
hard∣ship, self-denial, and obedience. In these classes one of the
boys more advanced and ex∣perienced than the rest, presided as captain to
govern and chastise the refractory. Their very sports and exercises
were regulated according to the exactest discipline, and made up of labour
and fatigue. They went barefoot, with their heads shaved, and fought with one
another naked. While they were at table it was usual for the masters to
instruct the boys, by asking them questions concerning the nature of
moral actions, or the different merits of the most not∣ed <PB N="29" REF="32"/> men of the time. The boys were obliged to give a quick and ready
answer, which was to be accompanied with his reasons in the con∣cisest
manner, for a Spartan's language was as sparing as his money was ponderous
and bulky. All ostentatious learning was banished from this simple
commonwealth, their only study was to obey, their only pride was to suffer
hardship. Every art was practised to harden them against adventitious
danger. There was yearly a custom of whipping them at the altar of Diana, and
the boy that bore this punish∣ment with the greatest fortitude came off
victo∣rious. This was inflicted publicly before the eyes of their parents, and
in the presence of the whole city; and many were known to ex∣pire under the
severity of the discipline without uttering a single groan. Even their
own fa∣thers, when they saw them covered with blood and wounds, and ready to
expire, exhorted them to persevere to the end with constancy and
resolution. Plutarch, who says that he has seen several children expire
under this cruel treatment, tells us of one who having stolen a fox, and hid
it under his coat, chose rather to let it tear out his very bowels than
discover the theft.</P>
<P>Every institution seemed tending to harden the body and
sharpen the mind for war. In <PB N="30" REF="33"/> order to prepare them for
stratagems and sud∣den incursions, the boys were permitted to steal
from each other, but if they were caught in the fact, they were punished for
their want of dexterity. Such a permission, therefore, was little better
than a prohibition of theft, since the punishment followed, as at
present, in case of detection. In fact, by this institution, negligence
in the possessor was made justly liable to the loss of his
possessions, a conside∣ration which has not been sufficiently
attended to by subsequent legislators.</P>
<P>At twelve years old the boys were removed into other class of a
more advanced kind. There, in order to crush the seeds of vice, which at
that time began to appear, their labour and discipline were encreased with
their age. There they had their instructor from among the men called
Paedonomus, and under him the Irens, young men selected from their own body,
to exercise a more constant and imme∣diate command over them. They had now
their skirmishes between parties, and their mock fights between larger
bodies. In these they often fought with hands, feet, teeth, and nails, with
such obstinacy that it was common to see them loose their eyes, and
often their lives before the fray was determined. Such was the constant 
<PB N="31" REF="34"/> discipline of their minority, which lasted till the
age of thirty, before which they were not permitted to marry, to go into the
troops, or to bear any office in the state.</P>
<P>With regard to the virgins, their discipline was equally strict
with the former. They were inured to a constant course of labour and
industry until they were twenty years old, be∣fore which time they were not
allowed to be marriageable. They also had their peculiar exercises. They
ran, wrestled, pitched the bar, and performed all these feats naked before
the whole body of the citizens. Yet this was thought no way indecent, as it was
supposed that the frequent view of the person would rather check than
excite every looser appetite. An education so manlike did not fail to
pro∣duce in the Spartan women corresponding sen∣timents. They were bold,
frugal, and pa∣triotic, filled with a sense of honour, and a love of
military glory. Some foreign women in conversation with the wife of Leonidas
say∣ing, that the Spartan women alone knew how to govern the men, she
boldly replied, the Spartan women alone bring forth men. A mother was known to
give her son, who was going to battle, his shield, with this remarkable
advice; 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>Return with it,</HI> or <HI>return upon
it.</HI></Q> Im∣plying, <PB N="32" REF="35"/> that rather than throw it from him
in flight, he should be borne upon it dead to his friends in Sparta. Another
hearing that her son was killed fighting for his country, she answered
without any emotion, it was for that I brought him into the world. After the
battle of Leuctra, the parents of those who died in the action, went to the
temples to thank the gods that their sons had done their duty, while those
whose children survived that dreadful day seem∣ed inconsoleable.</P>
<P>Yet it must not be concealed, that in a city where the women were
inspired with such a passion for military glory, they were not equal∣ly
remarkable for connubial fidelity. In fact, there was no law against
adultery, and an ex∣change of husbands was often actually practised among
them. This was always indeed by the mutual consent of parties, which removed
the tedious ceremonies of a divorce. One reason assigned for allowing
this mutual liberty, was not so much to gratify licentious desire, as to
improve the breed of citizens, by matching such as were possessed of
mutual inclination. In fact, in many of the laws of Lycurgus he seems to
admit, that private vices may become public benefits, and this among the
number.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="36"/> Besides these constitutional
resolutions, there were many other general maxims laid down that obtained the
force of laws among them. They were forbid to exercise any mechanic art. The
chief occupation of the Spartans was bodily exercises or hunting. The Helotes
who had lost their liberty some centuries be∣fore, and who had been
condemned to per∣petual slavery, tilled their lands for them, receiving for
their labour a bare subsistence. The citizens thus possessed of
competence and leisure, were mostly in company in their large common halls,
where they met and conversed together. They passed little of their time
alone, being accustomed to live like bees, always together, always attentive
to their chiefs and leaders. The love of their country and the public good was
their predominant pas∣sion, and all self-interest was lost in the
gene∣ral wish for the welfare of the community. Pedarctus having missed
the honour of being chosen one of the three hundred who had a certain rank in
the city, converted his disap∣pointment into joy, 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>that there were three hun∣dred better men in
Sparta than he.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Among the maxims of this legislator, it was forbidden them to make
frequent war upon the same enemies. By this inhibition they were 
<PB N="34" REF="37"/> restrained from lasting and immoderate re∣sentment,
they were in no danger of teaching their discipline to those they made war
upon, and all their alliances were thus more frequent∣ly renewed.</P>
<P>Whenever they had broken and routed their enemies, they never
pursued them farther than was necessary to make themselves sure of
the victory. They thought it sufficiently glo∣rious to overcome, and were
ashamed of de∣stroying an enemy that yielded or fled. Nor was this without
answering some good pur∣poses; for the enemy, conscious that all who
re∣sisted were put to the sword, often fled, as they were convinced that
such a conduct was the surest means of obtaining safety. Thus valour
and generosity seemed the ruling motives of this new institution; arms
were their only exercise and employment, and their life was much less
austere in the camp than the city. The Spartans were the only people in the
world to whom the time of war was a time of ease and refreshment, because
then the severity of their manners was relaxed, and the men were indulged in
greater liberties. With them the first and most inviolable law of war was
never to turn their backs on the enemy, however disproportioned in forces,
nor to de∣liver <PB N="35" REF="38"/> up their arms until they resigned them
with life. When the poet Archilochus came to Sparta, he was obliged to quit the
city for having asserted in one of his poems that it was better for a man
to lose his arms than his life. Thus resolved upon conquest or death,
they went calmly forward with all the confidence of success, sure of
meeting a glorious victory, or what they valued equally, a noble death.</P>
<P>Thus depending upon their valour alone for safety, their
legislator forbid walling the city. It was his maxim that a wall of men was
pre∣ferable to a wall of brick, and that confined valour was scarce
preferable to cowardice. Indeed a city, in which were thirty thousand
fighting men, stood in little need of walls to pro∣tect it; and we have
scarce an instance in his∣tory of their suffering themselves to be
driven to their last retreats. War and its honours was their employment and
ambition; their Helotes, or slaves, tilled their grounds, and did all their
servile drudgery. These unhappy men were in a manner bound to the soil,
it was not lawful to sell them to strangers, or to make them free. If at
any time their increase be∣came inconvenient, or created a suspicion in
their fierce masters, there was a <HI>cryptia,</HI> or <HI>se∣cret
act,</HI> by which they were permitted to de∣story <PB N="36" REF="39"/> them.
From this barbarous severity, however, Lycurgus is aquitted by Plutarch, but
it is plain, that his institutions were not sufficient to restrain the
people from such base∣ness and cruelty. It was by this act allowed for
several companies of young men to go out of the city by day, and concealing
themselves in the thickets, to rush out in the night upon their slaves,
and kill all they could find in their way. Thucydides relates, that two
thousand of these slaves disappeared at once without ever after being
heard of. It is truly amazing, how a people like the Spartans, renowned for
lenity to the conquered, for submission to their su∣periors, for
reverence to old age, and friend∣ship for each other, should yet be so
very bru∣tal to those beneath them; to men that ought to be considered in
every respect as their equals, as their countrymen, and only degraded by an
unjust usurpation. Yet nothing is more certain than their cruel treatment;
they were not only condemned to the most servile occu∣pations, but often
destroyed without reason. They were frequently made drunk and exposed
before the children, in order to deter them from so brutal a species of
debauchery.</P>
<P>Such was the general purport of the institu∣tions of Lycurgus,
which from their tendency <PB N="37" REF="40"/> gained the esteem and
admiration of all the surrounding nations. The Greeks were ever apt to be
dazzled rather with splendid than use∣ful virtues, and praised the laws
of Lycurgus, which at best were calculated rather to make men warlike than
happy, and to substitute in∣sensibility to enjoyment. If considered
in a political light, the city of Lacedaemon was but a military garrison,
supported by the la∣bour of a numerous peasantry that were slaves. The
laws, therefore, by which they were go∣verned, are not much more rigorous than
many of the military institutions of modern princes, the same labour, the
same discipline, the same poverty, and the same subordination, is
found in many of the garrisoned towns of Europe that prevailed for so many
centuries in Sparta. The only difference that appears to me between a soldier
of Lacedaemon, and a soldier in garrison at Gravelin, is, that the one was
permitted to marry at thirty, and the other is obliged to continue single all
his life; the one lives in the midst of a civilized country, which he is
supposed to protect, the other liv∣ed in the midst of a number of
civilized states, which he had no inclination to offend. War is equally the
trade of both, and a campaign is frequently a relaxation from the more rigorous
consinement of garrison duty.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="41"/> When Lycurgus had thus completed his military
institution, and when the form of go∣vernment he had established seemed
strong and vigorous enough to support itself, his next care was to give
it all the permanence in his power. He, therefore, signified to the people
that something still remained for the comple∣tion of his plan, and that he
was under a ne∣cessity of going to consult the oracle at Delphos for its
advice. In the mean time, he persuad∣ed them to take an oath for the strict
observance of all his laws till his return, and then depart∣ed with a full
resolution of never seeing Sparta more. When he was arrived at Delphos, he
consulted the oracle to know whether the laws he had made were sufficient
to render the La∣cedaemonians happy; and being answered that nothing was
wanting to their perfection, he sent this answer to Sparta, and then
voluntari∣ly starved himself to death. Others say, that he died in Crete,
ordering his body to be burnt, and his ashes to be thrown into the sea. The
death of this great lawgiver gave a sanc∣tion and authority to his laws which
his life was unable to confer. The Spartans regarded his end as the most
glorious of all his actions, and a noble finishing of all his former
services; they considered themselves as bound by every tie of gratitude
and religion to a strict observ∣ance <PB N="39" REF="42"/> of all his
institutions; and the long continuance of the Spartan government is a proof
of their persevering resolution.</P>
<P>The city of Lacedaemon thus instituted, seem∣ed only desirous
of an opportunity of display∣ing the superiority of their power among the
neighbouring states, their rivals. The war between them and the
Messenians soon taught them to know the advantages of their military
institution; but as I am hastening to more im∣portant events, I will touch
upon this as con∣cisely as I can. There was a temple of Diana common to the
Messenians and Lacedaemonians, standing upon the borders of either
kingdom. It was there that the Messenians were accused of attempting the
chastity of some Spartan virgins, and of killing Teleclus, one of the
Spartan kings, who interposed in their defence. The Messenians, on the
other hand, denied the charge, and averred, that these supposed vir∣gins
were young men thus dressed up with daggers under their cloaths, and placed
there by Teleclus with an intent to surprise them. To the mutual
resentment occasioned by this, another cause of animosity was soon
after added: Polychares, a Messenian, who had won the prize in the Olympic
games, let out some cows to pasture to Euphaenus, a Lacedae∣monian, 
<PB N="40" REF="43"/> who was to pay himself for their keep∣ing with a share
of the increase. Euphaenus sold the cows, and pretended they were stolen
from him. Polychares sent his son to demand the money; but the
Lacedaemonian, to aggra∣vate his crime, killed the young man, and persuaded
his countrymen to give no redress. Polychares, therefore, undertook to do
him∣self justice, and killed all the Lacedaemonians that came in his way.
Expostulations passed between both kingdoms, till at last the affair
came to a general war, which was carried on for many years with doubtful
success. In this situation the Messenians sent to consult the
oracle of Delphos, who required the sacrifice of a virgin of the family of
Aepytus. Upon casting lots among the descendants of this prince, the chance
fell upon the daughter of Lyciscus, but being thought to be
suppositi∣tious, Aristodemus offered his daughter, whom all allowed to be
his own. Her lover, how∣ever, attempted to avert the blow, by assert∣ing,
that she was with child by him, but her father was so enraged, that he
ripped up her belly with his own hand publicly to vindicate her innocence. The
enthusiasm which this sa∣crifice produced, served for a while to give
the Messenians the advantage, but being at last <PB N="41" REF="44"/>
overthrown and besieged in the city of Ithoe, Aristodemus finding all
things desperate, slew himself upon his daughter's grave. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. M. 3280.</NOTE> With him fell the kingdom of
Messenia, not without a most obstinate resistance, and many a
defeat of the Spartan army, which they held thus engaged for above twenty
years. Nor must we omit one memorable transaction of the Lacedaemonians
during this war: having drained their city of all its male inhabitants, and
obliged them∣selves by oath not to return until their designs were
accomplished; their women, in the mean time, remonstrated, that from their
long ab∣sence all posterity would be at an end To re∣medy this
inconvenience, they detached fifty of their most promising young men from
the army to go to Sparta, and to lie promiscuously with all the young women
they fancied. The offspring of these virgins were from them call∣ed
Partheniae, who finding themselves con∣temned and slighted by the Spartans
on their return, joined some years after in an insurrec∣tion with the
Helotes, but were soon suppress∣ed. Being expelled the state, they
went under the conduct of their captain, Philantus, and set∣tled at Tarentum,
in Italy.</P>
<P>After a rigorous subjection of thirty-nine years, the
Messenians once more made a vigo∣rous <PB N="42" REF="45"/> struggle for
freedom, being headed by Aristomenes, a young man of great courage and
capacity. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. M. 3319.</NOTE> The success of the first
engage∣ment was doubtful, and the Lacedaemonians being advised by the oracle
to send for a gene∣ral from among the Athenians, this politic state sent
them Tyrtaeus, a poet and schoolmaster, whose chief business was to
harrangue and re∣peat his own verses. The Spartans were little pleased with
their new leader, but their vene∣ration for the oracle kept them obedient to
his commands. Their success, however, did not seem to improve with their
duty; they suffer∣ed a defeat from Aristomenes, who, losing his shield
in the pursuit, their total overthrow was prevented. A second and a third
defeat fol∣lowed soon after; so that the Lacedaemonians, quite
dispirited, had thoughts of concluding a peace upon any terms. But Tyrtaeus
so en∣flamed them by his orations and songs in praise of military glory,
that they resolved upon an∣other battle, in which they were victorious, and
soon after Aristomenes was taken prisoner in a skirmish, with fifty
of his followers.</P>
<P>The adventures of this hero deserve our no∣tice. Being carried
prisoner to Sparta, he was thrown into a deep dungeon which had been used
for the execution of malefactors, <PB N="43" REF="46"/> and his fifty soldiers
with him. They were all killed by the fall except Aristomenes, who finding a
wild beast at the bottom preying up∣on a carcass, securing the animal's
mouth, he continued to hold by the tail, until the beast made directly to its
hole. There finding the issue too narrow, he was obliged to let go his
hold, but following the track with his eye, he perceived a glimmering from
above, and at length wrought his way out. After this extra∣ordinary escape,
he repaired immediately to his troops, and at their head made a success∣ful
sally, by night, against the Corinthian forces. Nevertheless he was once
more shortly after taken by some Cretans; but his keepers being made drunk,
he stabbed them with their own daggers, and returned to his forces. But his
single valour was not sufficient to avert the ruin of his country;
although, with his own single prowess, he had thrice earned the
Heca∣tomphonia, a sacrifice due to those who had killed one hundred of the
enemy hand to hand in battle, yet the body of his forces being small, and
fatigued with continual duty, the city of Eira, which he defended, was taken,
and the Messenians were obliged to take re∣fuge with Anaxilas, a prince of
Sicily. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. M. 3340.</NOTE> As for Tyrtaeus, the
Lacedaemonians made him <PB N="44" REF="47"/> free of their city, which was the
highest honour they had in their power to bestow. By the accession of
the Messenian country to the territory of Sparta, this state became one
of the most powerful of all Greece, and was second only to Athens, which
state it always considered with an eye of jealousy.</P>

<DIV1 N="3" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. III. Of the Government of ATHENS, the Laws of SOLON, and
the History of the Republic from the Time of SOLON to the commencement of the
PERSIAN War.</HEAD>
<P>WE now return to Athens. Codrus, the last king of this state,
having devot∣ed himself for the good of his country, a magistrate, under
the title of Archon, was appointed to succeed him. The first who bore this
office was Medon, the son of the late king, who, being opposed by his
brother Nileus, was preferred by the oracle, and ac∣cordingly invested with
his new dignity. This magistracy was at first for life; it was soon after
reduced to a period of ten years, and at last became annual, and in this
state it con∣tinued for near three hundred years. Dur∣ing this inactive
government little offers to <PB N="45" REF="48"/> adorn the page of history,
the spirit of exten∣sive dominion had not as yet entered into Greece, and
the citizens were too much em∣ployed in their private intrigues to attend to
foreign concerns. Athens therefore continued a long time incapable of enlarging
her power, content with safety amidst the contending in∣terests of
aspiring potentates and factious ci∣tizens.</P>
<P>A desire of being governed by written laws at last made way for
a new change in govern∣ment. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. M 3380.</NOTE> For more than a century they had
seen the good effects of laws in the regulation of the Spartan commonwealth;
and, as they were a more enlightened people, they expected greater advantages
from a new institution. In the choice, therefore, of a legislator, they
pitch∣ed upon Draco, a man of acknowledged wis∣dom, and unshaken integrity,
but rigid even beyond human sufferance. It does not ap∣pear that any state
of Greece was possessed of written laws before his time. However, he
was not afraid to enact the most severe laws, which laid the same
penalties on the most atro∣cious and the most trifling offences. These
laws, which punished all crimes with death, and which were said not to be
written with ink, but with blood, were too cruel to be duly and 
<PB N="46" REF="49"/> justly administered. Sentiments of humanity in the
judges, compassion for the accused when his fault was not equal to his
suffering, the unwillingness of witnesses to exact too cruel an
atonement, their fears also of the resent∣ment of the people; all these
conspired to ren∣der the laws obsolete before they could well be put into
execution. Thus, the new laws counteracted their own purposes, and their
excessive rigour paved the way for the most dangerous impunity.</P>
<P>It was in this distressful state of the com∣monwealth, that
Solon was applied to for his advice and assistance, as the wisest and
the justest man of all Athens. His great learn∣ing had acquired him the
reputation of being the first of the seven wise men of Greece, and his
known humanity procured him the love and veneration of every rank among his
fel∣low-citizens. Solon was a native of Salamis, an island dependent on
Athens, but which had revolted to put itself under the power of the
Megareans. In attempting to recover this island, the Athenians had spent
much blood and treasure, until at last wearied out with such ill
success, a law was made rendering it capital ever to advise the recovery
of their lost possession. Solon, however, undertook to per∣suade 
<PB N="47" REF="50"/> them to another trial, and feigning himself mad, ran
about the streets, using the most violent gestures and language; but
the purport of all was, upbraiding the Athenians for their remissness and
effeminacy, in giving up their conquests in despair. In short, he acted
his part so well, by the oddity of his man∣ner, and the strength of his
reasoning, that the people resolved upon another expedition against
Salamis; and, by a stratagem of his contrivance, in which he introduced
several young men upon the island in women's cloaths, the place was
surprised, and added to the do∣minion of Athens.</P>
<P>But this was not the only occasion on which he exhibited
superior address and wisdom. At a time when Greece had carried the arts
of eloquence, poetry, and government, higher than they had yet been seen
among mankind, Solon was considered as one of the foremost in each
perfection. The sages of Greece, whose fame is still undiminished,
acknow∣ledged his merit, and adopted him as their as∣sociate. The
correspondence between these wise men was at once instructive,
friendly, and sincere. They were seven in number, namely, Thales the
Milesian, Solon of Athens, Chilo of Lacedaemon, Pittacus of Mitylene,
Peri∣ander <PB N="48" REF="51"/> of Corinth, Bias and Cleobulus, whose birth
places are not ascertained. Those sages often visited each other, and
their conversa∣tions generally turned upon the methods of instituting the
best form of government, or the arts of private happiness. One day when
So∣lon went to Miletos to see Thales, the first thing he said, was to
express his surprize that Thales had never desired to marry, or have
children. Thales made him no answer then, but a few days after, he contrived
that a stran∣ger, supposed to arrive from Athens, should join their
company. Solon, hearing from whence the stranger came, was inquisitive
af∣ter the news of his own city, but was only in∣formed that a young man died
there, for whom the whole place was in the greatest af∣fliction, as he was
reputed the most promising youth in all Athens. Alas! cried Solon, how much
is the poor father of the youth to be pitied! pray, what was his name? I heard
the name, replied the stranger, who was in∣structed for the occasion, but
I have forgot it: I only remember that all people talked much of his wisdom
and justice. Every answer af∣forded new matter of trouble and terror to the
inquisitive father, and he had just strength enough to ask if the youth
was not the son of <PB N="49" REF="52"/> Solon? The very same, replied the
stranger; at which words Solon shewed all the marks of the most
inconsoleable distress. This was the opportunity which Thales wanted, who
took him by the hand, and said to him, with a smile, Comfort yourself my
friend, all that has been told you is a mere fiction, but may serve as a very
proper answer to your question, why I never thought proper to marry?</P>
<P>One day at the court of Periander of Corinth, a question was
proposed, which was the most perfect popular government? That, said Bias,
where the law has no superior. That, said Thales, where the inhabitants are
neither too rich nor too poor. That, said Anacharsis, the Scythian, where
virtue is honoured and vice detested. That, said Pittacus, where dignities
are always conferred upon the virtuous, and never upon the base. That, said
Cleobulus, where the citizens fear blame more than punishment. That, said
Chilo, where the laws are more regarded than the orators. But Solon's opinion
seems to have the greatest weight, who said, where an injury done to the
meanest subject is an insult upon the whole constitution.</P>
<P>Upon a certain occasion, when Solon was conversing with
Anacharsis, the Scythian phi∣losopher, about his intended reformations in 
<PB N="50" REF="53"/> the state; 
<Q REND="inline">"Alas, cried the Scythian, all your laws will be
found to resemble spiders webs; the weak and small flies will be caught
and entangled, but the great and powerful will always have strength enough to
break through."</Q></P>
<P>Solon's interview with Craesus king of Ly∣dia, is still more
celebrated. This monarch, who was reputed the richest of all Asia Minor,
was willing to make an oslentatious display of his wealth before the Greek
philosopher, and after shewing him immense heaps of treasure, and the
greatest variety of other ornaments, he demanded whether he did not think the
pos∣sessor the most happy of all mankind. No, replied Solon; I know
one man more happy, a poor peasant of Greece, who neither in afflu∣ence or
poverty, has but few wants, and has learned to supply them by his labour.
This answer was by no means agreeable to the vain monarch, who by his
question only hoped for a reply that would tend to flatter his pride.
Willing, therefore, to extort one still more favourable, he asked whether
at least he did not think him happy. Alas, cried Solon what man can be
pronounced happy before he dies. The integrity and the wisdom of So¦lon's
replies appeared in the event. The <PB N="51" REF="54"/> kingdom of Lydia was
invaded by Cyrus, the empire destroyed, and Craesus himself was taken
prisoner. When he was led out to exe∣cution, according to the barbarous
manners of the times, he then too late recollected the maxims of Solon, and
could not help crying out when on the scaffold upon Solon's name: Cyrus
hearing him repeat the name with great earnestness, was desirous of
knowing the rea∣son; and being informed by Craesus of that philosopher's
remarkable observation, he be∣gan to fear for himself, pardoned Craesus,
and took him for the future into confidence and friendship. Thus Solon had
the merit of saving one king's life, and of reforming an∣other.</P>
<P>Such was the man to whom the Athenians applied for assistance
in reforming the severity of their government, and instituting a just
body of laws. Athens was at that time divided in∣to as many factions as there
were different sorts of inhabitants in Attica. Those that lived up∣on the
mountains were fond of exact equality, those that lived in the low country
were for the dominion of a few, and those that dwelt on the sea coasts,
and were consequently addicted to commerce, were for keeping those parties
to exactly balanced, as to permit neither to <PB N="52" REF="55"/> prevail. But,
besides these, there was a fourth party, and that by much the most
numerous, consisting wholly of the poor, who were griev∣ously
harrassed and oppressed by the rich, and loaded with debts which they
were not able to discharge. This unhappy party, which, when they know their
own strength, must ever pre∣vail, were now determined to throw off the yoke
of their oppressors, and to chuse them∣selves a chief who should make
a reformation in government, by making a new division of lands.</P>
<P>As Solon had never sided with either, he was regarded as the
refuge of all, the rich lik∣ing him because he was rich, and the poor
be∣cause he was honest. Though he was at first unwilling to undertake
so dangerous an em∣ployment, he at last suffered himself to be chosen
archon, and to be constituted supreme legislator with the unanimous
consent of all. This was a situation in which nothing could be added to his
power, yet many of the citizens advised him to make himself king, but he
had too much wisdom to seek after a name which would render him obnoxious
to many of his fellow-citizens, while he was in fact possessed of more
than regal authority. 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>A tyranny,</HI> he would say, <HI>resembles
a fair garden, it is a beautiful</HI> <PB N="53" REF="56"/> <HI>spot while we
are within, but it wants a way to get out at.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Rejecting, therefore, the wish of royalty, he resolved upon
settling a form of government that should be founded on the basis of
just and reasonable liberty. Not venturing to meddle with certain
disorders which he looked upon as incurable, he undertook to bring about no
other alterations but such as were apparently reasonable to the meanest
capacity. In short, it was his aim to give the Athenians not the best of
possible constitutions, but the very best they were capable of
receiving. His first at∣tempt was, therefore, in favour of the poor, whose
debts he abolished at once, by an ex∣press law of insolvency. But to do
this with the least injury he could to the creditor, he raised the value of
money in a moderate pro∣portion, by which he nominally encreased their
riches. But his management on this oc∣casion had like to have had very
dangerous con∣sequences, for some of his friends, to whom the scheme had
been previously communicated, took up vast sums of money while it was
low, in order to be possessed of the difference when it became of
greater value. Solon himself was suspected of having a hand in this
fraud, but to wipe off all suspicion, he remitted his debtors 
<PB N="54" REF="57"/> five, or, as others say, fifteen talents, and thus
regained the confidence of the peo∣ple.</P>
<P>His next step was to repeal all the laws enacted by Draco, except
those against mur∣der. He then proceeded to the regulation of offices,
employments, and magistracies, all which he left in the hands of the rich. He
distributed the rich citizens into three classes, ranging them according
to their incomes. Those that were found to have five hundred measures
yearly, as well in corn as in liquids, were placed in the first rank, those
that had three hundred were placed in the second, and those that had but
two hundred made up the third. All the rest of the citizens whose in∣come
fell short of two hundred measures, were comprised in a fourth and last
class, and were considered as unqualified for any employment whatever. But
to compensate for this exclu∣sion, he gave every private citizen a
privilege of voting in the great assembly of the whole body of the state.
This, indeed, at first might appear a concession of small
consequence, but it was soon found to contain very solid advan∣tages.
For, by the laws of Athens, it was permitted, after the determination of the
ma∣gistrates, to appeal to the general assembly of <PB N="55" REF="58"/>
the people, and thus, in time, all causes of weight and moment came before
them.</P>
<P>In some measure to counteract the influence of a popular
assembly, he gave greater weight to the court of Areopagus, and also
institut∣ed another council consisting of four hundred. The Areopagus,
so called from the place where the court was held, had been establish∣ed
some centuries before, but Solon restored and augmented its authority. To
this court was committed the care of causing the laws to be observed and
put in execution. Before his time the citizens of the greatest probity and
justice were made judges of that tribunal. So∣lon was the first who thought
it convenient that none should be honoured with that digni∣ty but such as
had passed through the office of archon. Nothing was so august as this
court, and its reputation for judgment and integrity became so very great,
that the Romans some∣times referred causes which were too intricate for
their own decision, to the determination of this tribunal. Nothing was
regarded here but truth; that no external objects might pervert justice, the
tribunal was held in darkness, and the advocates were denied all attempts to
work upon the passions of the judges. Superior to this, Solon instituted
the great council of four <PB N="56" REF="59"/> hundred, who were to judge upon
appeals from the Areopagus, and maturely to exa∣mine every question before it
came to be de∣bated in a general assembly of the people.</P>
<P>Such was the reformation in the general in∣stitutions for the good
of the state, his parti∣cular laws for dispensing justice were more
nu∣merous. In the first place, all persons who in public dissensions
and differences espoused neither party, but continued to act with a
blameable neutrality, were declared infamous, condemned to perpetual
punishment, and to have all their estates confiscated. Nothing could more
induce mankind to a spirit of pa∣triotism than this celebrated law. A mind
thus obliged to take part in public concerns, learns, from habit, to make
those concerns its principal care, and self-interest quickly sinks
before them. By this method of accustoming the minds of the people to look
upon that man as an enemy that should appear indifferent and unconcerned in
the misfortunes of the public, he provided the state with a quick and general
resource in every dangerous emer∣gency.</P>
<P>He next permitted every particular per∣son to espouse the
quarrel of any one that was injured or insulted. By this means, every
per∣son <PB N="57" REF="60"/> in the state became the enemy of him who did
wrong, and the turbulent thus were over∣powered by the number of their
opponents.</P>
<P>He abolished the custom of giving portions in marriage with
young women, unless they were only daughters. The bride was to carry no other
fortune to her husband than three suits of cloaths, and some houshold
goods of little value. It was his aim to prevent mak∣ing matrimony a traffic,
he considered it as an honourable connexion, calculated for the mu∣tual
happiness of both parties, and the general advantage of the state.</P>
<P>Before this lawgiver's time the Athenians were not allowed to make
their wills, but the wealth of the deceased naturally, and of course,
devolved upon his children. Solon allowed every one that was childless to
dispose of his whole estate as he thought fit, preferring by that means
friendship to kindred, and choice to necessity and constraint. From
this institu∣tion the bond between the parents and chil∣dren became more
solid and firm, it confirm∣ed the just authority of the one, and
encreased the necessary dependence of the other.</P>
<P>He made a regulation to lessen the rewards to the victors at the
Olympic and Isthmian games. He considered it as unjust, that a set 
<PB N="58" REF="61"/> of idle people, generally useless, often danger∣ous to
the state, should be allotted those re∣wards which should go to the
deserving. He wished to see those emoluments go to the wi∣dows and
families of such as fell in the ser∣vice of their country, and to make the
stipend of the state honourable, by being conferred only on the brave.</P>
<P>To encourage industry, the Areopagus was charged with the care of
examining into every man's method of living, and of chastising all who led
an idle life. The unemployed were considered as a set of dangerous and
turbulent spirits, eager after innovation, and hoping to mend their fortunes
from the plunder of the state. To discountenance all idleness,
there∣fore, a son was not obliged to support his fa∣ther in old age or
necessity, if the latter had neglected giving him some trade or
occupa∣tion. All illegitimate children were also ex∣empted from the same
duty, as they owed little to their parents except an indelible re∣proach.</P>
<P>It was forbidden to give ill language in public; the magistrates
who were not eligible till thirty were to be particularly circumspect in
their behaviour, and it was even death for an archon to be taken drunk. It is
observable <PB N="59" REF="62"/> that he made no law against parricide, as
sup∣posing it a crime that could never exist in any community.</P>
<P>With regard to women, he permitted any man to kill an adulterer if
he was taken in the fact. He allowed of public brothels, but pro∣hibited
mercenary prostitutes from keeping company with modest women, and as a
badge of distinction to wear flowered garments. The men also who were
notorious for frequenting their company were not allowed to speak in public,
and he who forced a woman incurred a very heavy fine.</P>
<P>These were the chief institutions of this ce∣lebrated lawgiver,
and although neither so striking, nor yet so well authorised as those
of Lycurgus, they did not fail to operate for several succeeding ages, and
seemed to gather strength by observance. After he had framed these
institutes, his next care was to give them such notoriety that none could
plead ignorance. To this end transcripts of them were publicly hung up in the
city for every one to peruse, while a set of magistrates named
Thesmothetae, were appointed to revise them carefully, and distinctly
repeat them once a year. Then, in order to perpetuate his sta∣tutes, he
engaged the people by a public oath <PB N="60" REF="63"/> to observe them
religiously, at least for the term of an hundred years; and thus having
completed the task assigned him, he with∣drew from the city to avoid the
importunity of some, and the captious petulance of others. For, as he well
knew, it was hard, if not im∣possible, to please all.</P>
<P>Solon being thus employed on his travels in visiting Egypt, Lydia,
and several other countries, left Athens to become habituated to his new
institutions, and to try by experi∣ence the wisdom of their formation. But
it was not easy for a city long torn by civil dissen∣sions to yield
implicit obedience to any laws, how wisely soever framed; their former
ani∣mosities began to revive when that authority was removed which alone
could hold them in subjection. The factions of the state were headed by
three different leaders, who en∣flamed the animosity of the people against
each other, hoping by the subversion of all or∣der, to indulge their own
private hopes of aspiring. A person named Lycurgus was at the head of the
people that inhabited the low country, Pisistratus declared for those who
lived in the mountains, and Megacles was the leader of the inhabitants upon the
sea coast.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="64"/> Pisistratus was of these the most
powerful. He was a well bred man, of a gentle and in∣sinuating behaviour,
ready to succour and as∣sist the poor, whose cause he pretended to
espouse. He was wise, and moderate to his enemies, a most artful and
accomplished dis∣sembler, and was every way virtuous except in his
inordinate ambition. His ambition gave him the appearance of possessing
qualities which he really wanted, he seemed the most zealous champion for
equality among the citizens, while he was actually aiming at the entire
subversion of freedom, and he declared loudly against all innovations,
while he was actually meditating a change. The giddy multitude caught by
these appearances were zealous in seconding his views, and without
examining his motives were driving headlong to tyranny and destruction.</P>
<P>It was just at the eve of success, and upon the point of being
indulged in his utmost am∣bition, that Pisistratus had the mortification
of seeing Solon return after an absence of ten years, apprized of his
designs, and willing to subvert his schemes. Sensible, therefore, of
his danger, and conscious of the penetration of this great lawgiver, the
aspiring demagogue used all his artifice to conceal his real designs, 
<PB N="62" REF="65"/> and while he flattered him in public, used eve∣ry
endeavour to bring over the people to se∣cond his interests. Solon at
first endeavoured to oppose art to his cunning, and to foil him at his own
weapons. He praised him in his turn, and was heard to declare, what might
have been true, that excepting the immoderate am∣bition of Pisistratus, he
knew no man of greater, or more exalted virtues. Still, however, he set
himself to counteract his projects, and to defeat his designs before they
were ripe for execution.</P>
<P>But in a vicious commonwealth, no assiduity can warn, no
wisdom protect. Pisistratus still urged his schemes with unabating
ardour, and every day made new proselytes by his profes∣sions and his
liberalities. At length, finding his schemes ripe for open action, he gave
him∣self several wounds, and in that condition, with his body all bloody,
he caused himself to be carried in his chariot to the market-place, where,
by his complaints and eloquence, he so enslamed the populace, that they
considered him as the victim of their cause, and as suffer∣ing such
cruel treatment in their defence. An assembly of the people was, therefore,
imme∣diately convened, from whom he demanded a guard of fifty persons for his
future security. <PB N="63" REF="66"/> It was in vain that Solon used all
his authority and eloquence to oppose so dangerous a request. He
considered his sufferings as merely coun∣terfeited. He compared him to
Ulysses in Homer, who cut himself with similar designs; but he
alledged that he did not act the part right, for the design of Ulysses
was to deceive his enemies, but that of Pisistratus was level∣ed against
his friends and supporters. He up∣braided the people with their stupidity,
telling them, that for his own part he had sense enough to see through
this design, but they only had strength enough to oppose it. His
exhortations, however, were vain, the party of Pisistratus prevailed, and a
guard of fifty men was appointed to attend him. This was all that he aimed at,
for now having the protec∣tion of so many creatures of his own, nothing
remained but insensibly to encrease their num∣ber. Thus every day his
hirelings were seen to augment, while the silent fears of the citi∣zens
encreased in equal proportion. But it was now too late, for having raised
the number to put him beyond the danger of a repuise, he at length seized
upon the citadel, while none was left who had courage or conduct to
oppose.</P>
<P>In this general consternation, which was the result of folly on
the one hand, and treachery <PB N="64" REF="67"/> on the other, the whole city
was one scene of tumult and disorder, some flying, others inly
complaining, others preparing for slavery with patient submission.
Solon was the only man who, without fear or shrinking, deplored the folly of
the times, and reproached the Athe∣nians with their cowardice and treachery.
You might, said he, with ease have crushed the tyrant in the bud, but
nothing now remains but to pluck him up by the roots. As for himself, he had
at least the satisfaction of hav∣ing discharged his duty to his country
and the laws; and, as for the rest, he had nothing to fear, and now upon the
destruction of his country, his only confidence was in his great age, which
gave him hopes of not being a long survivor. In fact, he did not sur∣vive
the liberty of his country above two years; he died at Cyprus in the eightieth
year of his age, lamented and admired by every state of Greece. Besides his
skill in le∣gislation, Solon was remarkable for several other shining
qualifications. He understood eloquence in so high a degree, that from him
Cicero dates the origin of eloquence in Athens. He was successful also in
poetry, and Plato asserts, that it was only for want of due application
that he did not come <PB N="65" REF="68"/> to dispute the prize with Homer
him∣self.</P>
<P>The death of Solon only served to involve Athens in new troubles
and commotions. Ly∣curgus and Megacles, the leaders of the two opposite
factions, uniting, drove Pisistratus out of the city, but he was soon
after recalled by Megacles, who gave him his daughter in marriage. New
disturbances arose; Pisistratus was twice deposed, and twice found
means to reinstate himself, for he had art to acquire power, and moderation
to maintain it. The mildness of his government, and his implicit
submission to the laws, made the people forget the means by which he
acquired his power; and, caught by his lenity, they overlooked his
usurpation. His gardens and pleasure grounds were free to all the citizens;
and he is said to be the first who opened a public library at Athens.
Cicero is of opinion, that Pisistratus first made the Athenians
acquainted with the books of Homer, that he disposed them in the order in
which they now remain, and first caused them to be read at the feasts
called Pa∣nathanea. His justice is not less remarkable than his
politeness. Being accused of murder, though it was in the time of his
tyranny, he disdained to take the advantage of his autho∣rity, 
<PB N="66" REF="69"/> but went in person to plead his cause before the
Areopagus, where his accuser would not venture to appear. In short, he was
master of many excellent qualities, and perverted them no farther than as
they stood in competition with empire. Nothing could be objected to him but
his having greater power than the laws, and by not exerting that power he
al∣most reconciled the citizens to royalty. Upon these accounts he was
deservedly oppofed to usurpers of fewer virtues, and there feemed such a
resemblance between him and a more successful invader of his country's
freedom, that Julius Caesar was called the Pisistratus of Rome.</P>
<P>Pisistratus dying in tranquillity, transmitted the sovereign
power to his sons, Hippias and Hipparchus, who seemed to inherit all their
father's virtues. A passion for learning and its professors, had for
some time prevailed in Athens; and this city, which had already far out-gone
all its cotemporaries in all the arts of refinement, seemed to submit
tamely to kings, who made learning their pride and their pro∣fession.
Anacreon, Simonides, and others, were invited to their courts, and richly
reward∣ed. Schools were instituted for the improve∣ment of youth in the
learned professions, and <PB N="67" REF="70"/> Mercuries were set up in
all the highways, with moral sentences written upon them, for the
in∣struction of the lowest vulgar. Their reign, however, lasted but
eighteen years, and ended upon the following occasion.</P>
<P>Harmodius and Aristogiton, both citizens of Athens, had contracted
a very strict friend∣ship for each other, and resolved to revenge the
injuries which should be committed against either with common resentment.
Hipparchus being naturally amorous, debauched the sister of Harmodius, and
afterwards published her shame as she was about to walk in one of the
sacred processions, alledging, that she was not in a condition to
assist at the ceremony. Such a complicated indignity naturally excited
the resentment of the two friends, who formed a fixed resolution of
destroying the tyrants, or falling in the attempt. Willing, however, to wait
the most favourable opportunity, they de∣ferred their purpose to the
feast of the Pana∣thanea, in which the ceremony required that all the
citizens should attend in armour. For their greater security, they admitted
only a small number of their friends into the secret of their design,
conceiving that upon the first com∣motion they should not want for
abettors. Thus resolved, the day being come, they went early 
<PB N="68" REF="71"/> into the market-place, each armed with his dagger, and
steadfast to his purpose. In the mean time, Hippias was seen
issuing with his followers from the palace, to give orders with∣out the
city to the guards for the intended ceremony. As the two friends continued to
follow him at a little distance, they perceived one of those to whom they
had communicated their design, talking very familiarly with him, which made
them apprehend their plot was betrayed. Eager, therefore, to execute their
design, they were preparing to strike the blow, but recollected that the
real aggressor would thus go unpunished. They once more, there∣fore,
returned into the city, willing to begin their vengeance upon the author of
their in∣dignities. They were not long in quest of Hip∣parchus, they met him
upon their return, and rushing upon him, dispatched him with their daggers
without delay, but were soon after themselves slain in the tumult.
Hippias hear∣ing of what was done, to prevent farther dis∣orders, got all
these disarmed whom he in the least suspected of being privy to the
design, and then meditated revenge.</P>
<P>Among the friends of the late assertors of freedom, was one
Leona, a courtezan, who by the charms of her beauty, and her skill in 
<PB N="69" REF="72"/> playing on the harp, had captivated some of the
conspirators, and was supposed to be deep∣ly engaged in the design. As
the tyrant, for such the late attempt had rendered him, was conscious that
nothing was concealed from this woman, he ordered her to be put to the torture,
in order to extort the names of accomplices. But she bore all the cruelty of
their torments with invincible constancy; and lest she should in the
agony of pain be induced to a confession, she bit off her own tongue and
spit it in the ty∣rant's face. In this manner she died faithful to the
cause of liberty, shewing the world a remarkable example of constancy in
her sex. The Athenians would not suffer the memory of so heroic an action
to pass into oblivion. They erected a statue to her memory, in which a
lioness was represented without a tongue.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Hippias put no bounds to his indignation. A
rebellious people ever makes a suspicious tyrant. Numbers of citi∣zens were
put to death; and to guard himself for the future against a like
enterprize, he en∣deavoured to establish his power by foreign alliances. He
gave his daughter in marriage to the son of the tyrant of Lampsacus, he
cul∣tivated a correspondence with Artaphanes, go∣vernor <PB N="70" REF="73"/>
of Sardis, and endeavoured to gain the friendship of the Lacedaemonians, who
were at that time the most powerful people of Greece.</P>
<P>But he was supplanted in those very alliances from which he
hoped the greatest assistance. The family of the Alcmaeonidae, who from
the beginning of the revolution had been banished from Athens, endeavoured to
undermine his interests at Sparta, and they at length succeed∣ed. Being
possessed of great riches, and also very liberal in their
distribution, among other public services, they obtained liberty to rebuild
the temple at Delphos, which they fronted in a most magnificence manner with
Parian marble. So noble a munificence was not without a proper acknowledgement
of gratitude from the priestess of Apollo, who, willing to oblige them,
made her oracle the echo of their de∣sires. As there was nothing, therefore,
which this family so ardently desired as the downfall of regal power in
Athens, the priestess second∣ed their intentions, and whenever the
Spartans came to consult the oracle, no promise was ever made of the god's
assistance, but upon con∣dition that Athens should be set free. This
order was so often repeated by the oracle, that the Spartans at last
resolved to obey. Their <PB N="71" REF="74"/> first attempts were, however,
unsuccessful; the troops they sent against the tyrant were repulsed
with loss. A second effort succeeded. Athens was besieged, and the
children of Hippias were made prisoners as they were secretly conveying to
a place of safety out of the city. To redeem these from slavery, the
father was obliged to come to an accommodation, by which he con∣sented to
give up his pretensions to the sove∣reign power, and to depart out of the
Athenian territories in the space of five days. Thus, Athens was once more
set free from its tyrants, and obtained its liberty the very same year that
the kings were expelled from Rome. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. M. 3496</NOTE> The fa∣mily of Alcmaeon were
chiefly instrumental, but the people seemed fonder of acknowledg∣ing their
obligations to the two friends who struck the first blow. The names of
Harmo∣dius and Aristogiton were held in the highest respect in all
succeeding ages, and scarce consi∣dered inferior even to the gods
themselves. Their statues were erected in the market-place, an honour which
had never been rendered to any before; and, gazing upon these, the people
caught a love for freedom, and a detestation for tyranny, which neither time
nor terrors could ever after remove.</P>

<PB N="72" REF="75"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. IV. A short Survey of the State of GREECE previous to the
PERSIAN War.</HEAD>
<P>HITHERTO we have seen the states of Greece in constant
fluctuation, different states rising, and others disappearing, one petty
peo∣ple opposed to another, and both swallowed up by a third. Every city
emerging from the ancient form of government which was origi∣nally imposed
upon it, and by degrees acquir∣ing greater freedom. We have seen the
intro∣duction of written laws, and the benefits they produced by giving
stability to government.</P>
<P>During these struggles for power among their neighbouring
states, and for freedom at home, the moral sciences, the arts of eloquence,
poetry, arms, were making a rapid progress among them, and those
institutions which they originally borrowed from the Egyptians, were every
day receiving signal improvements. As Greece was now composed of several
small re∣publics bordering upon each other, and dif∣fering in their laws,
characters, and customs, <PB N="73" REF="76"/> this was a continual source
of emulation, and every city was not only desirous of warlike su∣periority,
but also of excelling in all the arts of peace and refinement. Hence they
were always under arms, and continually exercised in war, while their
philosophers and poets tra∣velled from city to city, and by their
exhorta∣tions and songs, warmed them with a love of virtue, and with an
ardour for military glory. These peaceful and military accomplishments
raised them to their highest pitch of grandeur, and they now only wanted an
enemy worthy of their arms to shew the world their superiority. The
Persian monarchy, the greatest at that time in the world, soon offered
itself as their oppon∣ent, and the contest ended with its total
sub∣version.</P>
<P>But as Greece was continually changing not only its government, but
its customs, as in one century it presented a very different pic∣ture from
what it offered in the preceding, it will be necessary to take a second
view of this confederacy of little republics previous to their contests with
Persia, as by comparing their strength with that of their opponent, we
shall find how much wisdom, discipline, and va∣lour, are superior to
numbers, wealth, and ostentation.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="77"/> Foremost in this confederacy we may rec∣kon
the city of Athens, commanding the little state of Attica, their whole
dominions scarce ex∣ceeding the largest of our English counties in
cir∣cumference. But what was wanting in extent was made up by the citizens
being inured to war, and impressed with the highest ideas of their own
superiority. Their orators, their philosophers, and their poets, had
already given lessons of politeness to mankind; and their generals,
though engaged only in petty conflicts with their neighbours, had begun to
practise new stratagems in war. There were three kinds of inhabitants in
Athens; citizens, strangers, and servants. Their number usual∣ly amounted
to twenty-one thousand citizens, ten thousand strangers, and from forty
to threescore thousand servants.</P>
<P>A citizen could only be such by birth, or adoption. To be a
natural denizen of Athens, it was necessary to be born of a father and
mo∣ther both Athenians, and both free. The people could confer the freedom of
the city upon strangers, and those whom they had so adopted, enjoyed
almost the same rights and privileges as the natural citizens. The quality
of citizen of Athens was sometimes granted in honour and gratitude to those
who merited <PB N="75" REF="78"/> well of the state, as to Hippocrates the
physician; and even kings sometimes canvassed that title for
themselves and their children. When the young men attained the age of twenty,
they were enrolled upon the list of citizens, after having taken an oath, and
in virtue of this they be∣came members of the state.</P>
<P>Strangers, or foreigners, who came to settle at Athens for the
sake of commerce, or of ex∣ercising any trade, had no share in
govern∣ment, nor votes in the assemblies of the people. They put
themselves under the protection of some citizen, and upon that account were
obliged to render him certain duties and ser∣vices. They paid a yearly
tribute to the state of twelve drachmas, and in default of pay∣ment were made
slaves, and exposed to sale.</P>
<P>Of servants, there were some free, and others slaves, who had
been taken in war, or bought of such as trafficked in them. The Athenians
were as remarkable for their lenity to these un∣happy men, as the Spartans
were noted for their fierceness and rigidity. There was even an asylum for
slaves, where the bones of The∣seus had been interred; and that asylum
sub∣sisted for near two thousand years. When slaves were treated with
too much rigour and inhumanity, they might bring their masters to 
<PB N="76" REF="79"/> justice; who, if the fact were sufficiently prov∣ed,
were obliged to sell them to another mas∣ter. They could even ransom
themselves against their master's consent, when they had laid up money
enough for that purpose, for out of what they got by their labour, after
having paid a certain proportion to their mas∣ters, they kept the remainder
for themselves, and made a stock of it at their own disposal. Private
persons when they were satisfied with their services, often gave them
their liberty; and when the necessity of the times obliged the state to
make their greatest levies, they were enrolled among the troops, and from
thence were ever after free.</P>
<P>The revenues of this city, according to Ari∣stophanes, amounted to
two thousand talents, or about three hundred thousand pounds of our money.
They were generally gathered from the taxes upon agriculture, the sale of
woods, the produce of mines, the contribu∣tions paid them by their allies, a
capitulation levied upon the inhabitants of the country, as well natives as
strangers, and from fines laid upon different misdemeanors. The
applica∣tion of these revenues was in paying the troops, both by land and
sea, building and fitting out sleets, keeping up and repairing public
build∣ings, <PB N="77" REF="80"/> temples, walls, ports, and citadels. But in
the decline of the republic, the greatest part was consumed in frivolous
expences, games, feasts, and shows, which cost immense sums, and were
of no manner of utility to the state.</P>
<P>But the greatest glory of Athens, was its be∣ing the school and
abode of polite learning, arts, and sciences. The study of poetry,
elo∣quence, philosophy, and mathematics began there, and came almost to
their utmost per∣fection. The young people were sent first to learn
grammar under masters who taught them regularly, and upon the principles of
their own language. Eloquence was studied with still greater attention, as
in that popular govern∣ment it opened the way to the highest employ∣ments. To
the study of rhetoric was annex∣ed that of philosophy, which comprised
all the sciences; and in these there were many mas∣ters, very
conversant, but, as is common, their vanity still greater than their
preten∣sions.</P>
<P>All the subordinate states of Greece seemed to make Athens the
object of their imitation; and, though inferior to it upon the whole, yet each
produced great scholars, and remarkable warriors in its turn. Sparta alone
took ex∣ample from no other state, but still rigorously 
<PB N="78" REF="81"/> attached to the institutions of its great law∣giver,
Lycurgus, it disdained all the arts of peace, which, while they polished,
served to enervate the mind, and, formed only for war, they looked forward to
campaigns and battles, as scenes of rest and tranquillity. All the laws of
Sparta, and all the institutions of Ly∣curgus, seemed to have no other
object than war; all other employments, arts, polite learn∣ing, sciences,
trades, and even husbandry it∣self, were prohibited amongst them. The
ci∣tizens of Lacedaemon were of two sorts, either those who inhabited the
city of Sparta, and, who for that reason were called Spartans, and those
who inhabited the country dependent thereon. In the times of Lycurgus the
Spar∣tans amounted to nine thousand men, the coun∣trymen to thirty
thousand. This number was rather diminished than encreased in
succeeding times, but it still composed a formidable body, that often
gave laws to the rest of Greece. The Spartan soldiers, properly so
called, were con∣sidered as the flower of the nation, and we may judge of
their estimation by the anxiety the republic expressed when three hundred
of them were once taken prisoners by the Athenians.</P>
<P>But notwithstanding the great valour of the Spartan state, it
was formed rather for a de∣fensive <PB N="79" REF="82"/> than an offensive
war. They were al∣ways careful to spare the troops of their coun∣try, and as
they had very little money, they were not in a capacity to send their armies
up∣on distant expeditions.</P>
<P>The armies both of Sparta and Athens were composed of four sorts
of troops: citizens, al∣lies, mercenaries, and slaves. The greatest number
of troops in the two republics were composed of allies, who were paid by the
ci∣ties who sent them. Those which received pay from their employers were
styled mercenaries. The number of slaves attending on every army was very
great, and the Helotes, in particular, were employed as light infantry.</P>
<P>The Greek infantry consisted of two kinds of soldiers; the one
heavy armed, and carrying great shields, spears, and scymetars; the other
light armed, carrying javelins, bows, and slings. These were commonly
placed in the front of the battle, or upon the wings, to shoot their arrows,
or fling their javelins and stones at the enemy, and then retire through the
in∣tervals behind the ranks, to dart out occasion∣ally upon the retiring
enemy.</P>
<P>The Athenians were pretty much strangers to cavalry, and the
Lacedaemonians did nor begin the use till after the war with Messene. 
<PB N="80" REF="83"/> They raised their horse principally in a small city
not far from Lacedaemon, called Sciros, and they were always placed on the
extremity of the left wing, which post they claimed as their rightful
station.</P>
<P>But to recompence this defect of cavalry, the Athenians, in naval
affairs, had a great supe∣riority over all the states of Greece. As they
had an extensive sea coast; and as the profes∣sion of a merchant was
held reptuable among them, their navy encreased, and was at length
sufficiently powerful to intimidate the fleets of Persia.</P>
<P>Such were the two states, that in some mea∣sure engrossed
all the power of Greece to them∣selves; and, though several petty kingdoms
still held their governments in independence, yet they owed their safety to
the mutual jea∣lousy of these powerful rivals, and always found shelter
from the one against the oppres∣sions of the other. Indeed the
dissimilarity of their habits, manners, and education, served as well to
divide these two states, as their politi∣cal ambition. The Lacedaemonians
were se∣vere, and seemed to have something almost brutal in their
character. A government too rigid, and a life too laborious, rendered their
tempers haughtily sullen and untractable. The <PB N="81" REF="84" MS="y"/>
Athenians were naturally obliging and agree∣able, chearful among each other,
and hu∣mane to their inferiors, but they were restless, unequal, timorous
friends, and capricious pro∣tectors. From hence neither republic could
sufficiently win over the smaller states of Greece to their interests;
and, although their ambi∣tion would not suffer the country to remain in
repose, yet their obvious defects were always a bar to the spreading their
dominion. Thus the mutual jealousy of these states kept them both in
constant readiness for war, while their common defects kept the lesser
states inde∣pendent.</P>

<DIV1 N="5" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. V. From the Expulsion of HIPPIAS to the Death of
DARIUS.</HEAD>
<P>IT was in this disposition of Athens and Sparta, and of the
lesser states, their neigh∣bours, that the Persian monarchy began to
in∣terest itself in their disputes, and made itself an umpire in their
contentions for liberty, on∣ly to seize upon the liberties of all. It has
been already related, that Hippias being be∣sieged in Athens, and his
children being taken <PB N="82" REF="85"/> prisoners, in order to release
them, he consented to abdicate the sovereign power, and to leave the
dominions of Athens in five days. Athens, however, in recovering its liberty,
did not en∣joy that tranquility which freedom is thought to bestow. Two of
the principal citizens, Calisthenes, a favourite of the people, and
Isa∣goras, who was supported by the rich, began to contend for that power
which they had but a little before joined in depressing. The for∣mer, who
was become very popular, made an alteration in the form of their
establishment; and, instead of four tribes, whereof they before
consisted, enlarged their number to ten. He also instituted the manner
of giving votes by Ostracism, as it was called. The manner of performing
this, was for every citizen, not under sixty years old, to give in a name
written upon a tile, or oyster-shell, (from whence the method of voting had
its name) and he upon whom the majority fell was pronounced banished for ten
years. These laws evidently calculated to encrease the power of the people,
were so dis∣pleasing to Isagoras, that, rather than submit, he had
recourse to Cleomenes king of Sparta, who undertook to espouse his
quarrel. In fact, the Lacedaemonians only wanted a favourable pretext for
lessening and destroying the power <PB N="83" REF="86"/> of Athens, which,
in consequence of the com∣mand of the oracle, they had so lately rescued
from tyranny. Cleomenes, therefore, avail∣ing himself of the divided state
of the city, en∣tered Athens, and procured the banishment of Calisthenes,
with seven hundred families more, who had sided with him in the late
commo∣tions. Not content with this, he endeavoured to new model the state,
but being strongly op∣posed by the senate, he seized upon the cita∣del,
from whence, however, in two days he was obliged to retire. Calisthenes
perceiving the enemy withdrawn, returned with his fol∣lowers, and finding it
vain to make any farther attempts for power, restored the government as
settled by Solon.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the Lacedaemonians re∣penting the services they
had rendered their rival state, and perceiving the imposture of the oracle,
by which they were thus impelled to act against their own interests, began
to think of reinstating Hippias on the throne. But, previous to their
attempt, they judged it pru∣dent to consult the subordinate states of
Greece, and to see what hopes they had of their concur∣rence and approbation.
Nothing however could be more mortifying than the universal detesta∣tion
with which their proposal was received by <PB N="84" REF="87"/> the deputies
of the states of Greece. The de∣puty of Corinth expressed the utmost
indigna∣tion at the design, and seemed astonished that the Spartans,
who were the avowed enemies of tyrants, should thus espouse the
interests of one noted for cruelty and usurpation. The rest of the
states warmly seconded his senti∣ments, and the Lacedaemonians, covered
with confusion and remorse, abandoned Hippias and his cause for ever
after.</P>
<P>Hippias being thus frustrated in his hopes of exciting the Greeks
to second his preten∣sions, was resolved to have recourse to one who
was considered as a much more powerful patron. Wherefore, taking his leave of
the Spartans, he applied himself to Artaphernes, governor of Sardis, for the
king of Persia, whom he endeavoured by every art to engage in a war against
Athens. He represented to him the divided state of the city, he enlarged
upon its riches, and the happiness of its situa∣tion for trade. He added
the ease with which it might be taken, and the glory that would at∣tend
success. Influenced by these motives, the pride and the avarice of the
Persian court were enflamed, and nothing was so ardently sought as the
pretext of a dispute with the Athenians. When, therefore, that city sent 
<PB N="85" REF="88"/> to the Persian court to vindicate their proceed∣ings,
alledging, that Hippias deserved no coun∣tenance from so great a people;
the answer re∣turned was, 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>That if the Athenians would be safe, they
must admit Hippias for their king.</HI></Q> Athens having so lately thrown
off the yoke, had too lively a sense of its past calamities to accept
safety upon such base conditions, and resolved to suffer the last
extremity rather than open their gates to a tyrant. When Artaphernes,
therefore, demanded the restoration of Hip∣pias, the Athenians boldly
returned him a downright and absolute refusal. From this arose the war
between Greece and Persia, one of the most glorious, and the most
remarkable that ever graced the annals of kingdoms.</P>
<P>But there were more causes than one tend∣ing to make a breach
between these powerful nations, and producing an irreconcileable aver∣sion
for each other. The Greek colonies of Ionia, Aeolia, and Caria, that were
settled for above five hundred years in Asia Minor, were at length
subdued by Craesus king of Lydia; and he, in turn, sinking under the
power of Cyrus, his conquests of course fell in with the rest of his
dominions. The Persian monarch thus possessed of a very extensive
territory, placed governors over the several cities that were 
<PB N="86" REF="89"/> thus subdued; and as men bred up in a des∣potic court,
were likely enough to imitate the example set them at home, it is probable
enough they abused their power. Be this as it may, in all the Greek cities
they were called Tyrants; and as these little states had not yet lost all
idea of freedom, they took every op∣portunity to recover their liberty, and
made many bold, but unsuccessful struggles in that glorious cause. The
Ionians particularly, who bore the greatest sway among them, let no
oc∣casion slip which promised the smallest hopes of shaking off the
Persian yoke.</P>
<P>That which favoured their designs upon the present occasion,
was the expedition of Darius into Scythia, into which country he sent a
nu∣merous army, laying a bridge over the river Ister for that purpose. The
Ionians were ap∣pointed to guard this important pass, but were advised by
Miltiades, whom we shall after∣wards find performing nobler exploits, to
break down the bridge, and thus cut off the Persian retreat. The Ionians,
however, rejected his counsel, and Darius returned with his army into Europe,
where he added Thrace and Ma∣cedon to the number of his conquests.</P>
<P>Histiaeus, the tyrant of Miletos, was the person who opposed
the advice of Miltiades; <PB N="87" REF="90"/> who, being of an ambitious and
intriguing dis∣position, was willing to lessen the merit of all his
cotemporaries, in order to enhance his own. But he was deceived in his
expecta∣tions of success; from these schemes Darius justly
suspecting his fidelity, took him with him to Susa, under pretence of
using his friend∣ship and advice, but in reality of preventing his future
machinations at home. But His∣tyaeus saw too clearly the cause of his
detension, which he regarded as a specious imprisonment, and therefore
took every opportunity of secret∣ly exciting the Ionians to a revolt, hoping,
that himself might one day be sent to bring them to reason.</P>
<P>Aristagoras was at that time this statesman's deputy at
Miletus, and received the instruc∣tions of his master to stir up the
Ionian cities to revolt with the utmost alacrity. In fact, from a late
failure of this general upon Naxos, his credit was ruined at the Persian
court, and no other alternative remained for him but to comply with the advice
of Histiaeus in stirring up a revolt, and of trying to place himself at
the head of a new confederacy.</P>
<P>The first step Aristagoras took to engage the affections of
the Ionians, was to throw up his power in Miletus, where he was deputy, 
<PB N="88" REF="91"/> and to reinstate that little place in all its former
freedom. He then made a journey through all Ionia, where, by his example, his
credit, and perhaps his menaces, he induced every other governor to imitate his
example. They all complied the more chearfully, as the Persian power since
the check it had received in Scy∣thia, was the less able to punish their
revolt, or to protect them in their continued attachment. Having thus united
all these little states by the consciousness of one common offence,
he then threw off the mask, declaring himself at the head of the
confederacy, and bid defiance to the power of Persia.</P>
<P>To enable himself to carry on the war with more vigour, he went in
the beginning of the following year to Lacedaemon, in order to en∣gage that
state in his interests, and engage it in a war with a power that seemed
every day to threaten the general liberty of Greece. Cleo∣menes was at that
time king of Sparta, and to him Aristagoras applied for assistance, in
what he represented as the common cause. He re∣presented to him, that the
Ionians and Lace∣daemonians were countrymen; that it would be for the honour of
Sparta to concur with him in the design he had formed of restoring the
Ioni∣ans to their liberty; that the Persians were <PB N="89" REF="92"/>
enervated by luxury; that their riches would serve to reward the conquerors,
while nothing was so easy as their overthrow. Considering the present
spirit of the Ionians, it would not be difficult, he said, for the
victorious Spar∣tans to carry their arms even to the gates of Susa, the
metropolis of the Persian empire, and thus give laws to those who
presumed to call themselves the sovereigns of the world. Cleomenes
desired time to consider this pro∣posal; and, being bred up in Spartan
ignorance, demanded how far it was from the Ionian sea to Susa?
Aristagoras, without considering the tendency of the question,
answered, that it might be a journey of three months. Cleome∣nes made no
answer, but turning his back upon so great an adventurer, gave orders that
before sun-set he should quit the city. Still, however, Aristagoras
followed him to his house, and finding the inefficacy of his eloquence, tried
what his offers of wealth could do. He at first offered him ten talents, he
then raised the sum to fifteen; and it is unknown what effect such a
large sum might have had upon the Spartan, had not his daughter, a child of
nine years old, who was accidentally present at the proposal, cried out, 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>Fly father, or this stranger will cor∣rupt
you.</HI></Q> This advice given in the moment of <PB N="90" REF="93"/>
suspense, prevailed; Cleomenes refused his bribes, and Aristagoras
went to sue at other cities, where eloquence was more honoured, and wealth
more alluring.</P>
<P>Athens was a city where he expected a more favourable reception.
Nothing could be more fortunate for his interests than his arrival at the
very time they had received the peremptory message from the Persians to
admit their ty∣rant, or to fear the consequences of their dis∣obedience.
The Athenians were at that time all in an uproar, and the proposal of
Aristago∣ras met with the most favourable reception. It was much easier
to impose upon a multitude than a single person, the whole body of
citi∣zens engaged immediately to furnish twenty ships to assist his
designs; and to these, the Eretrians and Eubaeans added five more.</P>
<P>Aristagoras, thus supplied, resolved to act with vigour, and
having collected all his forces together, set sail for Ephesus; where,
leaving his fleet, he entered the Persian fron∣tiers, and marched by land to
Sardis, the ca∣pital city of Lydia. Artaphernes, who resid∣ed there as the
Persian viceroy, finding the city untenable, resolved to secure himself
in the citadel, which he knew could not easily be forced. As most of the
houses of this city <PB N="91" REF="94"/> were built with reeds, and
consequently very combustible, one of the houses being set on fire by
an Ionian soldier, the flames quickly spread to all the rest. Thus the
whole town was quickly reduced to ashes, and numbers of the inhabitants
slain. But the Persians were soon avenged for this unnecessary
cruelty, for either recovering themselves from their former panic, or being
reinforced by the Lydians, they charg∣ed the Ionians in a body, and drove them
back with great slaughter. Nor was the pur∣suit discontinued even as far
as Ephesus, where the vanquished and the victors arriving to∣gether, a
great carnage ensued, and but a small part of the routed army escaped,
which took shelter aboard the fleet, or in the neigh∣bouring cities. Other
defeats followed after this. The Athenians intimidated with such a
commencement of ill-success, could not be persuaded to continue the war.
The Cypri∣ans were obliged once more to submit to the Persian yoke. The
Ionians lost most of their towns one after the other, and Aristagoras
fly∣ing into Thrace, was cut off by the inhabitants with all his forces.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Histiaeus, who was the original cause of all
these misfortunes, find∣ing that he began to be suspected in Persia,
left <PB N="92" REF="95"/> that court under a pretence of going to quell those
troubles, which he had all along secretly fomented, but his duplicity of
conduct ren∣dered him now suspicious to either party. Artaphernes, the
Persian viceroy, plainly ac∣cused him of treachery, while his own
Milesi∣ans refused to admit him as their master. Thus wavering,
uncertain, and not knowing where to turn, having picked up a few scattered
re∣mains of the routed armies, he fell in with Harpagus, one of the Persian
generals, who routed his forces, and made Histiaeus himself a prisoner.
Being sent to Artaphernes, that inhuman commander immediately caused him to
be crucified, and ordered his head to be sent to Darius, who received the
present with that disgust which evidenced his superior hu∣manity. He
wept over it with a friendly sor∣row, and ordered that it should receive
honour∣able interment.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the affairs of the Ionian confederacy every day
became more desperate. The Persian generals finding that Miletus was the
city which they chiefly depended on, re∣solved to march thither with all
their forces, concluding, that having carried that city, all the rest would
submit of course. The Ionians having intelligence of this design,
determined <PB N="93" REF="96"/> in a general assembly, to make no
opposition by land, where the Persians were too powerful; but to fortify
Miletus, and exert all their ef∣forts by sea, where they hoped for the
advan∣tage from their superior skill in naval evolu∣tions. They accordingly
assembled a fleet of three hundred ships at a little island over
against Miletus, and on the superiority of this fleet they placed their
whole reliance. But the Persian gold effected what their arms were un∣able to
compass. Their emissaries having se∣cretly debauched the greatest
part of the con∣federates, and engaged them to desert; when the two fleets
came to engage, the ships of Sa∣mos, Lesbos, and several other places,
sailed off, and returned to their own country. Thus the remaining part of the
fleet, which did not amount to more than an hundred ships, was quickly
overpowered, and almost totally de∣stroyed.</P>
<P>After this the city of Miletus was besieged, and was easily
taken. All the other cities, as well on the continent as among the islands,
were forced to return to their duty. Those who continued obstinate were
treated with great severity. The handsomest of the young men were
chosen to serve in the king's palace, and the young women were all sent
into Per∣sia. <PB N="94" REF="97"/> Thus ended the revolt of the Ionians,
which continued six years from its first break∣ing out under Aristagoras,
and this was the third time the Ionians were obliged to undergo the yoke of
foreign dominion, for they inhe∣rited a natural love of freedom, which all the
Greeks were known to possess.</P>
<P>The Persians having thus subdued the greatest part of Asia
Minor, began to look to∣wards Europe, as offering conquests worthy their
ambition. The assistance given the Ioni∣ans by the Athenian fleet, and
the refusal of that state to admit Hippias as their king, the taking of
Sardis, and the contempt they testifi∣ed for the Persian power, were all
sufficient motives for exciting the resentment of that empire, and for
marking out all Greece for de∣struction. Darius, therefore, in the
twenty-eighth year of his reign, having recalled all his other generals, sent
Mardonius, the son of Gobryas, a young nobleman who had lately married one of
the king's daughters, to com∣mand in chief throughout all the maritime parts of
Asia; and, particularly, to revenge the burning of Sardis. This was an
offence which that monarch seemed peculiarly to re∣sent, and from the time
of that conflagration, he had given orders for one of his attendants 
<PB N="95" REF="98"/> every time he sat down to table, to cry out, 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>remember the Athenians.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Mardonius, willing to second his master's animosity, quickly
passed into Thrace at the head of a large army, and so terrified the
in∣habitants of that country, that they yielded implicit obedience to his
power. From thence he set sail for Macedonia, but his fleet at∣tempting to
double the Cape of Mount Athos, in order to gain the coasts of that country,
they were attacked by so violent a tempest, that upwards of three hundred
ships were sunk, and above twenty thousand men perished in the sea.
His land army, that took the longest way about, met, at the same time, with
equal distresses. For being encamped in a place of no security, the
Thracians attacked them by night, and made a great slaughter among the enemy.
Mardonius himself was wounded, and finding his army unable to maintain the
field, he returned to the Persian court covered with grief and confusion,
having miscarried both by sea and land.</P>
<P>But the ill success of one or two campaigns was not sufficient
to abate the resentment, or the ardour of the king of Persia.
Possessed as he was of resources almost inexhaustible, wealth
without end, and armies that seemed <PB N="96" REF="99"/> to encrease from
defeat, he only grew more determined from every repulse, and doubled his
preparations in proportion to his former failures. He now perceived that the
youth and inexperience of Mardonius were unequal to so great an undertaking,
he, therefore, dis∣placed him, and appointed two generals, Da∣tis, a Mede,
and Artaphernes, the son of him who was late governor of Sardis, in his
stead. His thoughts were earnestly bent on attacking Greece with all his
forces; he wished to take a signal revenge upon Athens, which he
considered as the principal caufe of the late revolt in Ionia: besides,
Hippias was still near him to warm his ambition, and keep his resentment
alive. Greece, he said, was now an object for such a conqueror; the world
had long beheld it with an eye of admiration, and if not soon humbled, it
might in time supplant even Persia in the homage of the world.</P>
<P>Thus excited by every motive of ambition and revenge, Darius
resolved to bend all his attention to a war with Greece. He had in the
beginning of his reign sent spies with one Democedes, a Greek physician,
as their con∣ductor, to bring him information with respect to the strength
and situation of all the states of Greece. This secret deputation failed;
he <PB N="97" REF="100"/> was, therefore, willing once more to send men under
the character of heralds, to denounce his resentment; and, at the same
time, to learn how the different states of the country stood affected
towards him. The form used by the Persians, when they expected
submission from lesser states, was to demand earth and water in the
monarch's name, and such as refused were to be considered as opposers
of the Per∣sian power. On the arrival, therefore, of the heralds amongst
the Greeks, many of the ci∣ties, dreading the Persian power, complied with
their demands. The Eginetans, with some of the islands also, yielded up a
ready submission, and almost all but Athens and Sparta were contented
to exchange their liberties for safety.</P>
<P>But these two noble republics bravely dis∣dained to acknowledge
the Persian power; they had felt the benefits of freedom, and were resolved
to maintain it to the last. In∣stead therefore of offering up earth and
water as demanded, they threw the heralds, the one into a well, the other into
a ditch, and adding mockery to insult, desired them to take earth and water
from thence. This they probably did to cut off all hopes of a reconciliation,
and to leave no safety but in perseverance and despair.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="101"/> Nor were the Athenians content with this
outrage, but resolved also to punish the Aegine∣tans, who, by a base
submission to the Persian power, had betrayed the common cause of
Greece. They accordingly represented the affair to the Spartans, with all its
aggravating circumstances, and heightened with that elo∣quence for which they
were famous. Before such judges it was not likely that cowardice or timidity
would find many defenders; the Spar∣tans immediately gave judgment against
the people of Aegina, and sent Cleomenes, one of their kings, to apprehend
the authors of so base a concession. The people of Aegina, how∣ever,
refused to deliver them, under pretence that Cleomenes came without his
colleague. This colleague was Demaratus, who had himself secretly
furnished them with that excuse. As soon as Cleomenes was returned to
Sparta, in order to be revenged on Demaratus for thus counteracting the demands
of his country, he endeavoured to get him deposed, as not being of the royal
family. In fact, Demaratus was born only seven months after marriage, and
this was supposed by many to be a sufficient proof of his bastardy.
This accusation, there∣fore, being revived, the Pythian oracle was appointed
to determine the controversy; and <PB N="99" REF="102"/> the priestess
being privately suborned by Cleomenes, an answer was given against his
colleague just as he had dictated. Demaratus thus being declared
illegitimate, and unable to endure so gross an injury, banished himself
from his country, and retired to Darius, who received him with great
friendship, and gave him a considerable settlement in Persia. He was
succeeded in the throne by Leotychides, who concurring with the views of
Cleomenes, punished the Aeginetans, by placing ten of their most guilty
citizens in the hands of the Athenians; while Cleomenes, some time after,
being detected of having suborned the priestess, slew himself in a
fit of despair.</P>
<P>On the other hand, the Aeginetans com∣plained of the severity of
their treatment, but finding no likelihood of redress, they resolved to
obtain that justice by force which was re∣fused to their supplications.
Accordingly, they intercepted an Athenian ship, which in pursuance of an
annual custom ever since the times of Theseus, was going to Delos to
offer sacrifice. This produced a naval war between these two states; in
which, after a variety of fortunes, the Aeginetans were worsted, and the
Athenians possessed themselves of the so∣vereignty of the seas.
Thus these civil dis∣cords, <PB N="100" REF="103"/> which seemed at
first to favour the de∣signs of the common enemy, turned out to the general
advantage of Greece. For the Athe∣nians thus acquiring great power at sea,
were put in a capacity of facing the Persian fleets, and of cutting off
those supplies which were continually carrying to their armies by land.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the preparations on both sides for a general
war, were carried on with the greatest animosity and dispatch. Da∣rius
sent away his generals, Datis and Arta∣phernes, whom he had appointed in the
room of Mardonius, to what he supposed a certain conquest. They were
furnished with a fleet of six hundred ships, and an army of an hun∣dred
and twenty thousand men; their in∣structions were, to give up Athens and
Eretria, a little city which had joined in the league against him, to be
plundered; to burn all the houses and temples of both, and to lead away all
the inhabitants into slavery. The country was to be laid desolate, and the
army was provided with a sufficient supply of chains and fetters for
binding the conquered na∣tions.</P>
<P>To oppose this formidable invasion, the Athenians had only their
courage, their animo¦sity, their dread of slavery, their discipline<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <PB N="101" REF="104"/> and about ten
thousand men. Their civil commotions with the other states of Greece had
given them a spirit of war and stratagem, while the genius of their
citizens, continually excited and exercised, was arrived at its highest
pitch, and fitted them for every danger. Athens had long been refining in all
those arts which qualifies a state to extend, or to enjoy conquest; every
citizen was a statesman and a general, and every soldier considered
himself as one of the bulwarks of his country. But in this little state,
from whence first flowed all these im∣provements that have since adorned
and ci∣vilized society, there was at that time three men who were
considered as superiors to all the rest, all remarkable for their
abilities in war, and their integrity in peace, for those qua∣lifications
that can advance the glory of states, or procure the happiness of the
individual.</P>
<P>Of these Miltiades, as being the most ex∣perienced, was at that
time the most known. He was the son of Cimon, and nephew of Miltiades, an
illustrious Athenian, who ac∣cepted the government of the Dolonci, a people
of the Thracian Chersonesus. Old Miltiades dying without issue, he was
succeed∣ed in his government by Stesagoras his nephew, and he also dying,
young Militades was cho∣sen <PB N="102" REF="105"/> as his successor. He
was appointed to that government the same year that Darius undertook his
unsuccessful expedition against the Scythians. He was obliged to attend
that prince as far as the Ister with what shipping he was able to supply;
but ever eager to throw off the Persian yoke, it was he who advised the
Ionians to destroy the bridge, and leave the army of Darius to its fate. When
the affairs of the continent began to decline, Miltiades, rather than live in
dependence, resolved to re∣turn once more to Athens; and thither he re∣turned
with five ships, which were all that re∣mained of his shattered
fortunes.</P>
<P>At the same time, two other citizens, younger than Miltiades,
began to distinguish them∣selves at Athens, namely, Aristides and
The∣mistocles. These were of very different dis∣positions; but from
this difference resulted the greatest advantages to their country.
The∣mistocles was naturally inclined to a popular government, and omitted
nothing that could render him agreeable to the people, or gain him friends. His
complaisance was boundless, and his desire to oblige sometimes
out-stepped the bounds of duty. His partiality was often conspicuous.
Somebody talking with him once on the subject, told him he would make 
<PB N="103" REF="106"/> an excellent magistrate if he had more impar∣tiality: 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>God forbid, replied he, that I should ever
sit upon a tribunal where my friends should find no more favour than
strangers.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Aristides was as remarkable for his justice and integrity. Being
a favourer of aristocracy, in imitation of Lycurgus, he was friendly, but
never at the expence of justice. In seeking honours, he ever declined the
interests of his friends, lest they should, in turn, demand his
interest when his duty was to be impartial. The love of the public good was
the great spring of all his actions, and with that in view no difficulties
could daunt him, no success or elevation exalt. On all occasions he
preserv∣ed his usual calmness of temper, being per∣suaded that he was
entirely his country's, and very little his own. One day when an actor was
repeating some lines from Aeschylus on the stage, coming to a passage
which describ∣ed a man as not desiring to appear honest, but to be so,
the whole audience cast their eyes on Aristides, and applied the
passage. In the administration of public offices, his whole aim was to
perform his duty without any thought of enriching himself.</P>
<P>Such were the characters of the illustri∣ous Athenians that led
the councils of the <PB N="104" REF="107"/> state when Darius turned his arms
against Greece. These inspired their fellow-citizens with a noble
confidence in the justice of their cause, and made all the preparations
against the coming invasion that prudence and deli∣berate valour could
suggest. In the mean time, Datis and Artaphernes led on their nu∣merous
forces towards Europe; and after hav∣ing made themselves masters of the
islands in the Aegean sea without any opposition, they turned their
course towards Eretria, that city which had formerly assisted the
Ionians in their revolt. The Eretrians, now driven to the last extremity,
saw no hopes of meeting their enemy in the field, wherefore they sent back
four thousand men that the Athenians had supplied them with, and resolved
patient∣ly to stand a siege. For six days the Persians at∣tempted to
storm the city, and were repulsed with loss; but on the seventh, the
city, by the treachery of some of the principal inhabitants, being betrayed
into their hands, they entered, plundered, and burned it. The inhabitants were
put in chains, and sent as the first fruits of war to the Persian
monarch; but he, contrary to their expectation, treated them with great lenity,
and gave them a village in the coun∣try of Cissa for their residence,
where Apol∣lonius <PB N="105" REF="108"/> Tyanaeus found their descendants
six hundred years after.</P>
<P>After such splendid success at Eretria, no∣thing now
remained but the apparently easy conquest of Greece. Hippias, the expelled
tyrant of Athens, still accompanied the Per∣sian army, and led them by the
safest marches into the heart of the country; at length, flushed with
victory and certain of success, he conducted them to the plains of
Marathon, a fertile valley but ten miles distant from Athens. From thence
they sent to summon the citizens, acquainting them with the fate of
Fretria, and informing them that not a single inhabitant had escaped their
vengeance. But the Athenians were not to be intimidated by any vicinity of
danger. They had sent in∣deed to Sparta to implore succours against the
common enemy, which were granted without deliberation; but the superstition
of the times rendered their assistance ineffectual, for it was an
established law among the Spartans not to begin a march before the full
moon. They applied also to other states, but they were too much awed by the
power of Persia to move in their defence. An army of an hundred and twenty
thousand men, exulting in the midst of their country, was too formidable
for a <PB N="106" REF="109" MS="y"/> weak and jealous confederacy to oppose.
The inhabitants of Platea alone furnished them with a thousand soldiers,
and they were left to find all other assistance in their courage and
their despair.</P>
<P>In this extremity they were obliged to arm their slaves for the
safety of all, and their forces thus united amounted to but ten thou∣sand
men. Hoping therefore to derive from their discipline what they wanted in
power, they placed their whole army under the con∣duct of ten generals, of whom
Miltiades was chief, and these each was to have the com∣mand of the troops
day about in regular suc∣cession. An arrangement in itself so
unpro∣mising, was still more embarrassed by the ge∣nerals themselves
disputing whether they should hazard a battle, or wait the approach of the
enemy within their walls. The latter opinion seemed for a while to prevail;
it was urged that it would be rashness itself to face so pow∣erful and
well appointed an army with an handful of men. It was alledged that the
soldiers would gather courage from their se∣curity behind their walls, and
that the forces of Sparta without, might make a diversion in case of a
sally from within. Militades, how∣ever, declared for the contrary opinion,
and <PB N="107" REF="110"/> shewed that the only means to exalt the cou∣rage
of their own troops, and to strike a ter∣ror into those of the enemy, was
to advance boldly toward them with an air of confidence and desperate
intrepidity. Aristides also stre∣nuously embraced this opinion, and
exerted all his masculine eloquence to bring over the rest. The question
being put, when the suffrages came to be taken, the opinions were equal on
either side of the argument. It now there∣fore remained with Callimachus, the
Polem∣arch, who had a right of voting as well as the ten commanders, to give
his opinion and decide this important debate. It was to him Miltiades
addressed himself with the utmost earnestness, alledging that the
fate of his coun∣try was now in his power; that his single vote was to
determine whether his country should be enslaved or free; that his fame
might now, by a single word, be made equal to that of Harmodius and
Aristogiton, who were the au∣thors of Athenian liberty. Thus exhorted,
Callimachus did not long debate, but gave his voice in favour of an open
engagement; and Miltiades, thus seconded, prepared to marshal up his little
army for the great en∣counter.</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="111"/> In the mean time it appeared that so many
leaders commanding in succession, only served to perplex and counteract
each other. Ari∣stides perceived that a command which changes every day,
must be incapable of projecting or executing any uniform design; he
therefore gave it as his opinion that it was necessary to invest the
whole power in one single person, and to induce his colleagues to conform,
he himself set the first example of resignation. When the day came on
which it was his turn to command, he resigned it to Miltiades as the more
able and experienced general, while the other commanders, warmed by so
ge∣nerous a preserence followed his example.</P>
<P>Miltiades thus vested in the supreme com∣mand, which was now the
post of highest danger, like an experienced general, endea∣voured, by the
advantage of his ground, to make up for his deficiency in strength and
numbers He was sensible that by extending his front to oppose the enemy,
he must weaken it too much, and give their dense body the advantage. He
therefore drew up his army at the foot of a mountain, so that the enemy
should not surround him or charge him in the rear. On the flanks on either
side he caused large trees to be thrown, which were cut down 
<PB N="109" REF="112"/> for that purpose, and these served to guard him
from the Persian cavalry, that generally wheeled on the flank in the heat of
an en∣gagement.</P>
<P>Datis, on his side, was sensible of this ad∣vantageous
disposition, but relying on his supe∣riority of numbers, and unwilling to
wait till the Spartan reinforcements should arrive, he determined to engage.
And now was to be fought the first great battle which the Greeks had ever
engaged in. It was not like any of their former civil contests arising from
jealousy and terminating in an easy accommodation: it was a battle that was
to be decided with the greatest monarch of the earth, with the most
numerous army that had been hitherto seen in Europe. This was an engagement
that was to decide the liberty of Greece, and, what was of infinitely greater
moment, the future progress of refinement among mankind. Upon the event of
this battle depended the com∣plexion which the manners of the West were
hereafter to assume, whether they were to adopt Asiatic customs with
their conquerors, or to go on in modelling themselves upon Grecian
refinements, as was afterwards the case. This theresore may be considered
as one of the most important battles that ever <PB N="110" REF="113"/> was
fought, and the event was as little to be expected as the success was
glorious.</P>
<P>The signal was no sooner given than the Athenians, without
waiting the Persian onset, rushed in upon their ranks with desperate
ra∣pidity, as if wholly regardless of safety. The Persians regarded this
first step of the Athe∣nians as the result of madness, and were more
inclined to despise them as maniacs, than op∣pose them as soldiers.
However, they were quickly undeceived. It had never before been the custom of
the Greeks to run on with this headlong valour; but comparing the number of
their own forces with that of the enemy, and expecting safety only from
rashness, they determined to break through the enemies ranks or fall in the
attempt. The greatness of their danger added to their courage, and despair
did the rest. The Persians, however, stood their ground with great
intrepidity, and the battle was long, fierce, and obstinate. Mil∣tiades had
made the wings of his army ex∣ceeding strong, but had left the main body more
weak and not so deep, for having but ten thousand men to oppose to such
a nu∣merous army, he supposed the victory could be obtained by no other
means than strength∣ening his flanks, not doubting but when his 
<PB N="111" REF="114"/> wings were once victorious, they would be able to wheel
upon the enemies main body on ei∣ther side, and thus put them easily to the
rout. The Persians, therefore, finding the main body weakest, attacked it
with their ut∣most vigour. It was in vain that Aristides and
Themistocles, who were stationed in this post of danger, endeavoured to
keep their troops to the charge. Courage and intrepidity were unable to
resist the torrent of encreasing numbers, so that they were at last
obliged to give ground. But in the mean time the wings were victorious, and
now, just as the main body was fainting under the unequal encounter, these
came up and gave them time to recover their strength and order. Thus the
scale of victory quickly began to turn in their favour, and the Persians,
from being the aggressors, now began to give ground in turn, and being
unsupported by fresh forces, they fled to their ships with the utmost
precipitation. The con∣fusion and disorder was now universal, the
Athenians followed them to the beach and sat many of their ships on fire.
On this occasion it was that Cyndaeyrus, the brother of the poet Aeschylus,
seized with his hand one of the ships that the enemy was pushing off from
the shore. The Persians, within seeing them∣selves 
<PB N="112" REF="115"/> thus arrested, cut off his right hand that held the
prow, he then laid hold of it with his left, which they also cut off, at
last he seized it with his teeth, and in that manner expired.</P>
<P>Seven of the enemies ships were taken, above six thousand
Persians were slain, without rec∣koning those who were drowned in the
sea as they endeavoured to escape, or those who were consumed when the
ships were set on fire. Of the Greeks not above two hundred men were
killed, among whom was Callimachus, who gave his vote for bringing on the
engagement. Hippias, who was the chief incendiary of the war, is also thought
to have fallen in this battle, though some say he escaped and died
miserably at Lemnos.</P>
<P>Such was the famous battle of Marathon, which the Persians were
so sure of gaining, that they had brought marble into the field in order to
erect a trophy there. Just after the battle an Athenian soldier, whose
name was Eucles, still covered all over with blood and wounds, quitted the
army and ran to Athens to carry his fellow-citizens the news of the victory.
His strength just sufficed to reach the city, and throwing himself into
the door of the first house he met, he uttered three <PB N="113" REF="116"/>
words, 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>Rejoice, we triumph,</HI></Q> and instantly
ex∣pired.</P>
<P>While a part of the army marched forward to Athens, to protect it
from the attempts of the enemy, Aristides remained upon the field of battle
to guard the spoil and the prisoners; and although gold and silver were
scattered about the enemy's deserted camp in abundance, though their tents
and gallies were full of rich furniture and sumptuous apparel, he would not
permit any of it to be embezzled, but reserved it as a common reward for all
who had any share in obtaining the victory. Two thousand Spartans also,
whose laws would not permit them to march until the full of the moon, now
came into the field, but the action being over the day before, they only had an
opportunity of paying due honours to those who gained so glorious a
victory, and to bring back the news to Sparta. Of the marble which the
Persians had brought with them, the Athenians made a trophy, being carved by
Phidias into a statue, in honour of the goddess Nemesis, who had a temple
near the field of battle.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the Persian fleet, instead of sailing
directly back to Asia, made an attempt to surprise Athens before the
Greek forces could arrive from Marathon. But the latter <PB N="114" REF="117"/>
had the precaution to move directly thither, and performed their march with
so much ex∣pedition, that though it was forty miles from Marathon, they
arrived there in one day. In this manner the Greeks not only repelled their
enemies, but confirmed their security. By this victory the Grecians were
taught to know their own strength, and not to tremble before an ene∣my
terrible only in name. This taught them through the whole of succeeding ages
to imi∣tate their ancestors with an ardent emulation, and inspired them
with a wish of not degene∣rating from the Grecian glory. Those Athe∣nians
that were slain in battle had all the ho∣nour immediately paid them that was
due to their merit. Illustrious monuments were erect∣ed to them all in the
very place where the bat∣tle was fought, upon which their names, and the tribe
to which they belonged, were inscrib∣ed. There were three distinct sets
of monu∣ments set up; one for the Athenians, one for the Plataeans, and a
third for the slaves who had been enrolled into their troops upon that urgent
occasion.</P>
<P>But their gratitude to Miltiades spoke a nobleness of mind, that
far surpassed expensive triumphs, or base adulation. Sensible that
his merits were too great for money to repay, <PB N="115" REF="118"/> they
caused a picture to be painted by Po∣lygnotus, one of their most celebrated
artists, where Miltiades was represented at the head of the ten commanders
exhorting the soldiers, and setting them an example of their duty. This
picture was preserved for many ages, with other paintings of the best
masters, in the por∣tico where Zeno afterwards instituted his school of
philosophy. An emulation seemed to take place in every rank of life;
Polygnotus valued himself so much upon the honour of being ap∣pointed to
paint this picture, that he gave his labour for nothing. In return for such
genero∣sity, the Amphyctions appointed him a pub∣lic lodging in the city
where he might reside during pleasure.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. M.
3514.</NOTE></P>
<P>But though the gratitude of the Athenians to Miltiades was very
sincere, yet was it of no long continuance. This fickle and jealous people,
naturally capricious, and now more than ever careful of preserving their
freedom, were willing to take every opportunity of mor∣tifying a general, from
whose merit they had much to fear. Being appointed with seventy ships to
punish those islands that had favoured the Persian invasion, and
having raised the siege of Paros, upon a false report of the arri∣val of
the enemy's fleet, he returned unsuccess∣fully <PB N="116" REF="119"/> to
Athens, where he was accused by one Xanthippus, of having taken a bribe from
Per∣sia. As he was not in a condition to answer this charge, being confined
to his bed by a fall he received at Paros; the accusation took place
against him, and he was condemned to lose his life. The manner of executing
cri∣minals found guilty of great offences, was by throwing them into the
Barathrum, a deep pit, from whence none were ever seen to return. This
sentence was pronounced against him, but his former services were such,
as to have this punishment commuted into a penalty of fifty talents, the
sum which it had cost the state in fitting out the late unsuccessful
expedi∣tion. Not being rich enough to pay this sum, he was thrown into
prison, where the bruise on his thigh growing worse, from bad air and
confine∣ment, it turned at last to a gangrene, and put an end to his life and
misfortunes.</P>
<P>Cimon, his son, who was at this time very young, signalized his
piety on this occasion. As this ungrateful city would not permit the body of
Miltiades to be buried until all his debts were paid, this young man employed
all his interest among his friends, and strained his ut∣most credit to
pay the fine, and procured his fa∣ther's body an honourable interment.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. From the Death of MILTIADES to the Retreat of XERXES
out of Greece.</HEAD>
<P>THE misfortunes of Darius only served to encrease his
resentment, and give spirit to his perseverance. Finding the ill
success of his generals, he resolved to try the war in person, and
dispatched orders throughout his whole dominions for fresh preparations.
However, a revolt in Egypt for a while averted his resent∣ment, a contest
among his sons about nominat∣ing his successor still farther retarded
his de∣signs; and, at last, when he had surmounted every obstacle, and
was just preparing to take a signal vengeance, his death put an end to all
his projects, and gave Greece a longer time for preparation.</P>
<P>Xerxes, his son, succeeded, who, with the empire, inherited
also his father's animosity against Greece. Having carried on a
success∣ful expedition against Egypt, he expected the same good fortune
in Europe. Confident of victory, he did not chuse, he said, for the fu∣ture
<PB N="118" REF="121"/> to buy the figs of Attica; he would possess
himself of the country, and thus have figs of his own. But, before he engaged
in an enter∣prize of that importance, he thought proper to assemble his
council, and collect the opi∣nions of the principal officers of his court. In
his speech at opening the council, he evidently shewed his desire of
revenge, and his passion for military glory. The best way, therefore, to
pay court to this young monarch, was by flattering him in his favourite
pursuits, and giving his impetuous aims the air of studied designs.
Mardonius, grown neither wiser nor less ambitious by his own bad
success, be∣gan by extolling Xerxes above all other kings that had gone
before. He urged the indis∣pensible necessity of avenging the
dishonour done to the Persian name; he represented the Greeks as cowards,
that were accidently suc∣cessful, and was firmly of opinion, that they
would never more stand even the hazard of a battle. A discourse that so
nearly conincided with his own sentiments, was very pleasing to the young
monarch, and the rest of the com∣pany by their looks, and their silence,
seemed to applaud his impetuosity. But Artabanus, the king's uncle, who had
long learned to re∣verence courage even in an enemy, and presum∣ing 
<PB N="119" REF="122"/> upon his age and experience, to speak his real
sentiments, rose with an honest freedom to represent the intended
expedition in its true light. 
<Q REND="inline">"Permit me, sir, said he, to deliver my
sentiments upon this occasion with a liberty suitable to my age and your
interest. When Darius, your father, and my brother, first thought of making
war against the Scythi∣ans, I used all my endeavours to divert him from it.
The people you are going to at∣tack are infinitely more formidable than they.
If the Athenians alone could defeat the numerous army commanded by Datis and
Artaphernes, what ought we to expect from an opposition of all the states
of Greece united? You design to pass from Asia into Europe, by laying a
bridge over the sea. But what if the Athenians should advance and destroy
this bridge, and so prevent our return? Let us not expose ourselves to
such dangers, as we have no sufficient motives to compel us to face them;
at least let us take time to reflect upon it. When we have ma∣turely
deliberated upon an affair, whatever happens to be the success of it, we
have no∣thing to regret. Precipitation is imprudent, and is usually
unsuccessful. Above all, do not suffer yourself, great prince, to be
dazzled <PB N="120" REF="123"/> with the splendor of imaginary glory. The
highest and the most lofty trees have the most reason to dread the
thunder. God loves to humble the ostentatious, and reserves to him∣self
alone the pride of importance. As for you, Mardonius, who so earnestly urge
this expedition, if it must be so, lead it forward. But let the king,
whose life is dear to us all, return back to Persia. In the mean time, let
your children and mine be given up as a pledge to answer for the success
of the war. If the issue be favourable, I consent that mine be put to
death, but if it prove other∣wise, as I well foresee, then I desire that
you and your children may meet the reward of rashness."</Q></P>
<P>This advice, which was rather sincere than palatable, was received
by Xerxes with a de∣gree of rage and resentment. 
<Q REND="inline">"Thank the Gods, cried he, that thou art my father's
brother; were it not for that thou shouldst this moment meet the just
reward of thy au∣dacious behaviour. But you shall have your punishment;
remain here behind among the women; these you but too much resemble in your
cowardice and fear. Stay here while I march at the head of my troops where my
duty and glory call me."</Q> Upon cooler <PB N="121" REF="124"/> thoughts,
however, Xerxes seemed better re∣conciled to his uncle's opinion. When the
first emotions of his anger were over, and he had time to reflect on his
pillow upon the different counsels that were given him, he confessed the
rashness of his former rebuke, and ingenuously ascribed it to heat of
youth and the ardour of passion. He offered to come over to his opinion, at
the same time assuring the council, that from his dreams he had every
encouragement to proceed with the expedition. So much condescension on the
one hand, and such favourable omens on the other, deter∣mined the whole
council to second his incli∣nations. They fell prostrate before him, eager
to shew their subm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssion and
their joy. A mon∣arch thus surrounded by flatterers, all striving which
should most gratify his pride and pas∣sions, could not long continue
good, though naturally inclined to virtue. Xerxes therefore seems a character
thus ruined by power, ex∣erting his natural justice and wisdom at short
intervals, but then giving way to the most culpable and extravagant
excesses. Thus the counsel of Arrabanes being rejected, and that of
Mardonius favourably received, the most extensive preparations were made
for carrying on the war.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="125"/> The greatness of these preparations
seemed to shew the high sense which the Persians had of their enemy.
Xerxes, that he might omit nothing conducive to success, entered into an
alliance with the Carthaginians, who were, at that time, the most potent
people of the West; with whom it was stipulated, that while the Persian
forces should attack Greece, the Car∣thaginians should awe the Greek
colonies, dis∣persed over the Mediterranean, from coming to their
assistance. Thus having drained all the East to compose his own army,
and the West to supply that of the Carthaginians under Amilcar, he set
out from Susa in order to en∣ter upon this war, 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. M. 3523.</NOTE> ten years after the battle of
Marathon.</P>
<P>Sardis was the place where the various na∣tions that were compelled
to his banner were to assemble. His fleet was to advance along the coasts
of Asia Minor towards the Hel∣lespont. But as in doubling the cape of Mount
Athos many shipwrecks were sustained, he was resolved to cut a
passage through that neck of land which joined the mountain to the
con∣tinent, and thus give his shipping a shorter and safer passage.
This canal was a mile and a half long, and hollowed out from a high mountain;
it required immense labour to per∣form <PB N="123" REF="126"/> so great a
work, but his numbers and his ambition were sufficient to surmount all
difficulties. To urge on the undertaking the faster, he treated his labourers
with the greatest severity, while with all the ostentation of an
Eastern prince he gave his commands to the mountain to sink before him: 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>Athos, thou proud aspiring mountain, that
liftest up thy head unto the heavens, be not so audacious as to put
ob∣stacles in my way. If thou givest them that op∣position, I will cut
thee level to the plain, and throw thee headlong into the sea.</HI></Q></P>
<P>As this monarch passed on in his march to the place of general
destination, he went through Cappadocia, crossed the river Halys, and
came to Calene, a city of Phrygia, near the source of the river Meander. He
was there met by Pythias, a Lydian prince, who, by the most extreme
parsimony and oppression, had become, next to Xerxes, the most opulent
man in all the Persian empire. His treasures, however, were not
sufficient to buy off the at∣tendance of his eldest son, whom he
requested might be permitted to remain with him, as he was old and
helpless. He had before offered his money, which amounted to about four
millions sterling, for the monarch's use; but this Xerxes had refused,
and now, finding the <PB N="124" REF="127"/> young prince willing to remain with
his father, he was so enraged that he commanded him to be put to death before
his father's eyes. Then causing the dead body to be cut in two, and one part
of it to be placed on the right, and the other on the left, he made the whole
army pass between them to terrify them from a re∣luctance to engage by his
example.</P>
<P>From Phrygia Xerxes marched to Sardis, and, in the opening of
spring, directed his march down towards the Hellespont, where his fleet lay
in all their pomp, expecting his ar∣rival. Here being arrived, he was
desirous of taking a survey of all his forces, which com∣posed an army
which was never equalled either before or since. It was composed of the
most powerful nations of the East, and of people scarce known to
posterity except by name. The remotest India contributed its supplies,
while the coldest tracts of Scythia sent their assistance. Medes,
Persians, Bactrians, Ly∣dians, Assyrians, Hyrcanians, and an hundred
other countries of various forms, complexions, languages, dresses, and
arms. The land army, which he brought out of Asia, consisted of
seventeen hundred thousand foot, and four∣score thousand horse. Three
hundred thousand more that were added upon crossing the Hel∣lespont, 
<PB N="125" REF="128"/> made all his land forces together amount to above two
millions of men. His fleet when it set out from Asia, consisted of
twelve hundred and seven vessels, each carry∣ing two hundred men. The
Europeans aug∣mented his fleet with an hundred and twenty vessels, each of
which carried two hundred men. Besides these there were two thousand
smaller vessels fitted for carrying provisions and stores; the men
contained in these, with the former, amounted to six hundred thou∣sand,
so that the whole army might be said to amount to two millions and an half,
which, with the women, slaves, and futtlers, always accompanying a Persian
army, might make the whole above five mil∣lions of souls: a number, if
rightly con∣ducted, capable of overturning the greatest monarchy, but being
commanded by pre∣sumption and ignorance, they only served to obstruct and
embarrass each other.</P>
<P>Lord of so many and such various subjects, Xerxes found a
pleasure in reviewing his forces, and was desirous of beholding a naval
engagement, of which he had not hitherto been a spectator. To this end a
throne was erected for him upon an eminence, and in that situation beholding
all the earth covered <PB N="126" REF="129"/> with his troops, and all the sea
crowded with his vessels, he felt a secret joy diffuse itself through
his frame from the consciousness of his own superior power. But all the
workings of this monarch's mind were in extreme, a sudden sadness soon
took place of his plea∣sure, and dissolving in a shower of tears, he
gave himself up to a reflection that not one of so many thousand would be
alive a hundred years after.</P>
<P>Artabanus, who neglected no opportunity of moralizing upon every
occurrence, took this occasion to discourse with him upon the
shortness and miseries of human life. Finding this more distant
subject attended to, he spoke more closely to the present occasion,
insinuated his doubts of the success of the expedition; urged the many
inconveniencies the army had to suffer, if not from the enemy, at least
from their own numbers. He alledged, that plagues, famine, and confusion,
were the necessary at∣tendants of such ungovernable multitudes by land,
and that empty fame was the only re∣ward of success. But it was now too
late to turn this young monarch from his purpose. Xerxes informed his monitor
that great actions were always attended with proportionable dan∣ger, and that
if his predecessors had observed such <PB N="127" REF="130"/>
scrupulous and timorous rules of conduct, the Persian empire would never
have attained to its present height of glory.</P>
<P>Xerxes, in the mean time, had given or∣ders for building a bridge of
boats across the Hellespont for the transporting his army into Europe.
This narrow streight, which now goes by the name of the Dardanels, is near an
English mile over. But soon after the com∣pletion of this work, a violent
storm arising, the whole was broken and destroyed, and the labour was to
be undertaken anew. The fury of Xerxes upon this disappointment was at∣tended
with equal extravagance and cruelty. His vengeance knew no bounds; the work∣men
who had undertaken the task, had their heads struck off by his order; and
that the sea itself also might know its duty, he or∣dered it to be
lashed as a delinquent, and a pair of fetters to be thrown into it to curb
its fu∣ture irregularities. Thus having given vent to his absurd
resentment, two bridges were or∣dered to be built in the place of the former,
one for the army to pass over, and the other for the baggage and the beasts
of burthen. The workmen, now warned by the fate of their predecessors,
undertook to give their la∣bours greater stability, they placed three
hun∣dred <PB N="128" REF="131"/> and sixty vessels across the
streight, some of them having three banks of oars, and others fifty oars a
piece. They then cast large anchors into the water on both sides, in order
to fix these vessels against the vio∣lence of the winds, and the
current. They then drove large piles into the earth, with huge rings fastened
to them, to which were tied six vast cables which went over each of the two
bridges. Over all these they laid trunks of trees, cut purposely for that
use, and flat boats again over them fastened and joined together, so as
to serve for a floor or solid bottom. When the whole work was thus
completed, a day was appointed for their pass∣ing over, and as soon as
the first rays of the sun began to appear, sweet odours of all kinds were
abundantly scattered over the new work, and the way was strewed with
myrtle. At the same time Xerxes poured out libations into the sea, and
turning his face towards the East, worshipped that bright luminary which is
the god of the Persians. Then, throwing the vessel which had held his
libation into the sea, together with a golden cup and Persian scymetar,
he went forward and gave orders for the army to follow. This immense train
were no less than seven days and seven nights <PB N="129" REF="132"/>
passing over, while those who were appointed to conduct the march
quickened the troops by lashing them along, for the soldiers of the East,
at that time and to this very day, are treated like slaves.</P>
<P>Thus this immense army having landed in Europe, and being joined
by the several na∣tions of Europe that acknowledged the Persian power,
Xerxes prepared for marching directly forward into Greece. Beside the
generals of every nation, who each of them commanded the troops of their
respective countries, the land army was commanded by six Persian
ge∣nerals, to whom all the rest were subordinate. These were Mardonius,
Tirintatechmus, Smer∣donus, Massistus, Gergis, and Megabyzus. Ten
thousand Persians, who were called the Immortal Band, were commanded by
Hy∣darnes, while the cavalry and the fleet had their own respective
commanders. Beside those who were attached to Xerxes from prin∣ciple, there
were some Greek princes, who, either from motives of interest or fear,
fol∣lowed him in this expedition. Among these were Artemisia, queen of
Hallicarnassus, who, after the death of her husband, governed the kingdom
for her son. She had brought in∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eed but the trifling succour of five ships, but 
<PB N="130" REF="133"/> she had made ample amends by her superior prudence,
courage, and conduct. Of this number also was Demaratus, the exiled king of
Sparta, who, resenting the indignity put upon him by his subjects, took
refuge in the Persian court, an indignant spectator of its luxuries and
slavish submission. Being one day asked by Xerxes if he thought the
Gre∣cians would dare to await his approach, or would venture an engagement with
armies that drank up whole rivers in their march. 
<Q REND="inline">Alas, great prince, cried Demaratus, Greece, from
the beginning of time, has been trained up and accustomed to poverty; but the
defects of that are amply recompensed by virtue, which wisdom cultivates,
and the laws support in vigour. As for the Lacedaemonians, as they have been
bred up in freedom, they can never submit to be slaves. Though all the
rest of the Greeks should forsake them, though they should be reduced
to a band of a thou∣sand man, yet still they would face every dan∣ger to
preserve what they hold dearer than life. They have laws which they obey with
more implicit reverence than your subjects are obeyed by you. By these laws
they are forbid to fly in battle, and they have only the alternative to conquer
or to die."</Q> Xerxes was not offended <PB N="131" REF="134"/> with the liberty
of Demaratus, but, smiling at his blunt sincerity, ordered his army to
march forward, while he had directed his fleet to follow him along the coast,
and to regulate their course by his motions.</P>
<P>In this manner he pursued his course with∣out any interruption,
every nation near which he approached sending him all the marks of homage and
subjection. Wherever he came he found provisions and refreshments
prepared before-hand, pursuant to the orders he had given. Every city he
arrived at, exhausted itself in giving him the most magnificent
re∣ception. The vast expence of these feasts gave a poor Thracian an
opportunity of re∣marking, that it was a peculiar favour of the gods that
Xerxes could eat but one meal a day. Thus did he continue his march through
Thrace, Macedonia, and Thessaly, every knee bending before him till he came
to the streights of Thermopylae, where he first found an army prepared to
dispute his passage.</P>
<P>This army was a body of Spartans, led on by Leonidas their king, who
had been sent thither to oppose him. As soon as it was known in Greece
that Xerxes was preparing to invade that country, and that an army of millions
were coming on with determined re∣solution <PB N="132" REF="135"/> to ruin it,
every state seemed dif∣ferently affected in proportion to its strength,
its courage, or its situation. The Sicilians re∣fused their aid, being kept
in awe by Amilcar the Carthaginian. The Corcyreans pretended that they were
wind-bound, and would not let their ships stir from the harbour. The
Cre∣tans, having consulted the Delphic oracle, ab∣solutely determined to
remain inactive. The Thessalians and Macedonians, from their situ∣ation,
were obliged to submit to the conqueror, so that no states were found
bold enough to face this formidable army but Athens and Lacedaemon. These
states had received intel∣ligence of the Persian designs from Demara∣tus,
long before they had been put into ex∣ecution. They had also sent spies
to Sardis, in order to have a more exact information of the number and quality
of the enemy's forces. The spies indeed were seized, but Xerxes or∣dered
them to be conducted through his army, and to give an exact account of what
they had seen at their return. They had sent deputies to all the
neighbouring states to awaken their ardour, to apprise them of their
danger, and to urge the necessity of fighting for their com∣mon safety.
But all their remonstrances were vain; fear, assuming the name of
prudence, <PB N="133" REF="136"/> offered frivolous excuses, or terms which
were inadmissible. Relying therefore on their own strength, these
generous states resolved to face the danger with joint forces, and conquer
or fall in the cause of freedom. Having sum∣moned a general council at the
Isthmus, they there solemnly resolved to wave all private quarrels or
pretensions, and join against the common danger.</P>
<P>One cannot, without astonishment, reflect on the intrepidity of
the Greeks, who deter∣mined to face the innumerable army of Xerxes with such
disproportioned forces. All their forces joined together amounted only to
eleven thousand two hundred men. But they were all soldiers, bred amidst
fatigue and danger, all determined to a man either to conquer or die. Their
first care, however, was to appoint a general. It was then that the most
able and experienced captains, terrified at the danger' had taken the
resolution of not presenting themselves as candidates. Epicydes indeed, a
man of ignorance, avarice, and presumption, was ready to lead them on, and,
under his guidance, nothing could be hoped for but confusion and
disappointment. In this pressing juncture, therefore, Themistocles,
conscious of his own capacity, and warmed with a love <PB N="134" REF="137"/>
of glory, which was great in proportion to the danger, resolved to use
every art to get him∣self appointed to the command. For this purpose he
used all his interest, and even dis∣tributed bribes to remove his
competitor, and having gratified the avarice of Epycides, which was his ruling
passion, he soon found himself appointed to the command, which was the
darl∣ing object of his ambition.</P>
<P>But in this pressing exigence it was incum∣bent on the Athenians
to avail themselves of every person that might be serviceable, how∣ever
obnoxious he might appear to their re∣sentment. There were many useful
citizens whom they had, upon some factious discon∣tents, sent into
banishment, and these they now repentingly wished to restore. Among
this number was Aristides, that brave and just man, who had, at the battle
of Marathon, and upon other occasions, been instrumental in gaining their
victories, and who had, upon all occasions, improved them by the
disinterest∣edness and integrity of his example. This magistrate having
had many contests with Themistocles, who was his rival in power and same,
and always wished to supplant him, was at length condemned to go into
banishment by the power of his prevailing faction. It was on 
<PB N="135" REF="138"/> that occasion that a peasant, who could not write,
and did not know Aristides personally, applied to himself, and desired
him to write the name of Aristides upon the shell by which his vote was
given against him. 
<Q REND="inline">"Has he done you any wrong, said Aristides, that
you are for condemning him in this manner."</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>No, replied the peasant, but I hate to hear
him praised for his justice.</HI>"</Q> Aristides, without say∣ing a
word more, calmly took the shell, wrote down his own name upon it, and
contentedly retired into banishment. But the present dis∣tresses of
his country were now an object that strongly sollicited his return. Even
The∣mistocles, his rival, was so far from remem∣bering his old
resentments, that he now ar∣dently desired the assistance of his
counsel, and gave up all his private resentments to the good of the
state. The hatred of these great men had nothing in it of that bitter and
impla∣cable spirit which prevailed among the Ro∣mans in the latter times of
the republic, or perhaps the desperate situation of their coun∣try might
only occupy their thoughts at that time.</P>
<P>But the preparations by land alone were not sufficient to repel
the growing danger. If the Greeks had trusted to their land armies with∣out 
<PB N="136" REF="139"/> further succour, they must have been un∣done.
Themistocles, who saw that the vic∣tory of Marathon must be followed by
many more before safety could be ascertained, had prudently caused an
hundred gallies to be built, and turned all his thoughts to give Athens a
superiority at sea. The oracle had declared some time before that Athens
should only de∣fend herself with wooden walls, and he took the advantage of
that ambiguity to persuade his countrymen, that by such walls was only
meant her shipping. He had the address to procure some money annually
coming in from silver mines, which the Athenians had in their district, to
the purposes of equipping and manning this fleet, and now, upon the ap∣proach
of Xerxes, the confederates found themselves at the head of a very powerful
squadron of two hundred and eighty sail, the command of which was conferred
upon Eury∣brades, a Lacedaemonian.</P>
<P>All measures being taken that this brave confederacy could
devise, it next remained to settle in what place they should first meet
the Persians in the field, in order to dispute their entrance into Greece.
The people of Thes∣saly represented that as they were most exposed
and first liable to be attacked by the enemy, <PB N="137" REF="140"/> it was
but reasonable that their security should be the first object of
attention. The Greeks, willing to protect all who would declare in their
quarrel, in pursuance of this request, resolved to send their chief
forces to guard the passage which separates Macedonia from Thessaly,
near the river Peneus. But Alexander, the son of Amyntas, representing that
post as unten∣able, they were obliged to change their mea∣sures, and at
last resolved to send a body of men to guard the pass at Thermopylae
where a few were capable of acting against numbers.</P>
<P>Thermopylae was a narrow pass of twenty-five feet broad, between
Thessaly and Phocis, defended by the remains of a wall, with gates to it,
formerly built by the Phocians, to secure them against the incursions of
their neighbour∣ing enemy. From these gates, and some hot baths, which were
at the entrance into the pass, the streight had its name. This was pitched
upon, as well for the narrowness of the way, as for its vicinity to the
sea, from whence the land forces could occasionally receive
as∣sistance from the fleet. The command of this important pass was
given to Leonidas, one of the kings of Sparta, who led thither a body of six
thousand men. Of these, three hundred <PB N="138" REF="141"/> were Spartans,
the rest consisting of Baeotians, Corinthians, Phocians, and Arcadians,
all such as in the present exigency were prepared for the field, and were
not afraid of the numbers of the enemy. Each of these had particular
commanders of their own, but Leonidas had the conduct of the whole. But though
the determined resolution of these troops was in∣capable of being shaken,
little was expected from the nature of their destination. They were all along
taught to look upon themselves as a forelorn hope, only placed there to check
the progress of the enemy, and give them a foretaste of the desperate
valour of Greece; nor were even oracles wanting to check their ardour. It had
been declared, that to procure the safety of Greece it was necessary that
a king, one of the descendants of Hercules, should die. This task was
chearfully undertaken by Leoni∣das; and, as he marched out from Lacedae∣mon, he
considered himself as a willing victim offered up for the good of his
country: how∣ever, he joyfully put himself at the head of his little band,
took possession of his post, and with deliberate desperation waited
at Thermo∣pylae for the coming up of the Persian army.</P>
<P>Xerxes, in the mean time, approaching with his numerous army,
flushed with success, <PB N="139" REF="142"/> and confident of victory.
His camp exhibit∣ed all the marks of eastern magnificence and Asiatic
luxury. He expected to meet no ob∣struction on his way to Greece; he led on
his forces rather to terrify the enemy than to fight them; great, therefore,
was his surprize, to find that a few desperate men were determined to
dispute his passage. He had all along flat∣tered himself, that on the
first hearing of his arrival, the Grecians would betake themselves to
flight, nor could he ever be persuaded to be∣lieve what Demaratus had
assured him, that at the first pass he came to, his whole army would be
put to a stand. He himself took a view of their camp and entrenchments. The
Lacedae∣monians were some of them calmly amusing themselves with military
exercises, others with combing their long hair. He enquired the reason of
this conduct, and he was informed, that it was the Spartan manner of preparing
themselves for battle. Still, however, enter∣taining some hopes of their
flight, he wait∣ed four days to give them time to reflect on the greatness of
their danger, but they still continued gay and unconcerned, as men who
regarded death as the end of labour. He sent to them to deliver up their
arms. Leonidas, with truly Spartan contempt, desired him to 
<PB N="140" REF="143"/> <HI>come and take them.</HI> He offered, if they would
lay down their arms, to receive them as friends, and to give them a country
much larger and better than what they fought for. No coun∣try, they replied,
was worth acceptance, un∣less won by virtue; and that for their arms, they
should want them, whether as his friends or enemies. Upon this, the monarch
address∣ed himself to Demaratus, asking, if these des∣perate men
could expect to out-run his horses? Demaratus answered, that they would
fight it out to the last, and not a man of them would sur∣vive his
country's freedom. Some men were heard to say, that the Persians were so
numerous, that their darts would darken the sun. Dieneces, a Spartan,
replied, Then we shall fight in the shade.</P>
<P>Xerxes, thus treated with contempt, at length ordered a body of
Medes to advance, desiring such as had lost any of their relations at the
battle of Marathon, to take their re∣venge upon the present occasion.
According∣ly they began the onset, but were repulsed with great loss. The
number of the assailants only served to encrease their confusion, and
it now began to appear that Xerxes had many followers, but few soldiers.
These forces being routed by the Grecian troops, the Persian Immortal Band
was brought up, <PB N="141" REF="144"/> consisting of ten thousand men, to
oppose them. But these were as unsuccessful as the former. The charge
was renewed the next day, Xerxes endeavouring to inspire his troops with the
promises of reward, since he found they were dead to the sense of
shame. But though their charge was violent, it was unsup∣ported, and the
Greeks standing closely con∣nected in a body, withstood the shock, and
fill∣ed the way with Persian carcasses. During these unsuccessful
assaults, Xerxes was a spectator, sitting upon his throne, placed upon
an emi∣nence, and directing the order of battle, im∣petuous in his pride and
resentment, and now and then seen to leap from his seat when he be∣held
his troops in confusion, or offering to give way.</P>
<P>Thus did the Greeks keep their ground for two days, and no power on
earth seemed cap∣able of removing them from their advantage∣ous station.
Xerxes, out of all hopes of being able to force a passage, appeared under
the greatest consternation; but he was relieved from his embarrassment
by the appearance of Epialtes, a Trachinian, who had deserted from the enemy,
and undertook to shew his troops a secret path that led through the defiles
of the mountains, and through which a body <PB N="142" REF="145"/> of forces
might be led to fall upon the Greci∣ans in the rear. He quickly, therefore,
dis∣patched a body of twenty thousand men thither, who marching all night,
arrived at the break of day at the top of the mountain, and possess∣ed
themselves of that advantageous post.</P>
<P>The Greeks were soon apprised of this mis∣fortune, and
Leonidas seeing that his post was no longer tenable, advised the troops
of his allies to retire, and reserve themselves for bet∣ter times, and the
future safety of Greece. As for himself, and his fellow Spartans, they were
obliged by their laws not to fly; that he owed a life to his country, and that
it was now his duty to fall in its defence. Thus, having dis∣missed all
but his three hundred Spartans, with some Thespians and Thebans, in all not
a thou∣sand men, he exhorted his followers in the most chearful manner to
prepare for death. 
<Q REND="inline">Come, my fellow soldiers, says he, <HI>lets us
dine chear∣fully here, for to-night we shall sup with Pluto.</HI></Q> His
men upon hearing his determined pur∣pose, set up a loud shout, as if they
had been invited to a banquet, and resolved every man to sell his life as
dearly as he could. The night now began to advance, and this was thought the
most glorious opportunity of meeting death in the enemy's camp, where 
<PB N="143" REF="146"/> the silence would favour desperation, and hide the
smallness of their numbers. Thus resolv∣ed, they made directly to the
Persian tents, and, in the darkness of the night, had almost reached the
royal pavilion, with hopes of sur∣prising the king. The obscurity added
much to the horror of the scene, and the Persians fall∣ing upon each other
without distinction, rather assisted the Grecians than defended
themselves. Thus success seemed to crown the rashness of their
enterprize, until the morning beginning to dawn, the light discovered the
smallness of their numbers. They were soon, therefore, surrounded by
the Persian forces, who, fear∣ing to fall in upon them, flung their javelins
from every quarter, till the Greeks, not so much conquered, as tired with
conquering, fell amidst heaps of the slaughtered enemy, leaving behind them
an example of intrepidity never known before. Leonidas was one of the first
that fell, and the endeavours of the Lace∣daemonians to defend his dead body
were incre∣dible. It was found after the battle, buried under a mountain of the
dead, and was nailed to a cross, by way of infamy, by the brutal victor. Of
all the train, two only escaped, whose names were Aristodemus and
Panites. The latter, upon his return to Sparta, was <PB N="144" REF="147"/>
branded with infamy, and treated with such contempt, that he killed
himself. Aristode∣mus reserved himself for another occasion, and by
his bravery at the battle of Platea recovered that honour which he had lost.
Some time after this transaction the Amphyctions ordered a magnificent
monument to be erected over these brave defenders of their country, and
Si∣monides, the poet, wrote their epitaph.</P>
<P>Xerxes in this battle is said to have lost twenty thousand
men, among which were two of his brothers. But to conceal the greatness of
his loss from the army, he caused all but a thousand of those that were
slain, to be buried in holes indiscriminately; however, this strata∣gem
had very bad success, for when the soldiers of his fleet were curious
some time after in tak∣ing a survey of the field of battle, they
disco∣vered the artifice, and urged it as an act of fla∣grant impiety
against him.</P>
<P>Dismayed at an obstinacy in the enemy that cost him so dear,
Xerxes was for some time more inclined to try his fortune at sea, than to
proceed immediately into the country, where he had learned from Demaratus, that
eight thousand Spartans, such as he had but lately fought with, were ready
to receive him. Ac∣cordingly, the very day of the battle of Thermo∣pylae, 
<PB N="145" REF="148"/> there was an engagement at sea between the two fleets.
The Grecian fleet consisted of two hundred and seventy-one vessels.
That of the enemy had lately lost four hundred vessels in a shipwreck,
but was still greatly superior to the fleet of the Grecians. To repair this
loss by a victory, two hundred Persian vessels had orders to take a
compass and surprize the Grecians lying in the streights of Eubaea, but
the Grecians being apprized of their designs, set sail by night, and
so, by a counter-surprize, fell in with them while they were thus
sepa∣rated from their main squadron, took and sunk thirty, forced the
rest to sea, and there, by stress of weather, they were all soon
after ei∣ther sunk or stranded. Enraged at these dis∣appointments, the
Persians bore down the next day with their whole fleet, and drawing up in
form of an half moon, made an offer of battle, which the Greeks as readily
accepted. The Athenians, having been reinforced with three and sisty
sail, the battle was very obsti∣nate and bloody, and the success pretty
near equal on both sides, so that both parties seemed content to retire
in good order.</P>
<P>All these actions which passed near Arte∣misa, though at
that time indecisive, yet served not a little to animate and inspire the
Athe∣nians, <PB N="146" REF="149"/> who were now taught to think that there was
nothing either formidable in the numbers, or useful in the size of the
Persian ships. Thus strengthening themselves with the hopes of more
splendid engagements, they sailed away from Artemisa and stopped at
Salamis, where they might most conveniently assist the Athe∣nians.</P>
<P>In the mean time Xerxes having entered with his numerous army into
the country of Phocis, burning and plundering every town through which he
passed. The inhabitants of Peloponnesus, who were naturally defended by
their inaccessible situation, as their country was joined to the
continent only by a neck of land, thought it the most prudent way to de∣fend
the isthmus by a wall, to take shelter be∣hind that rampart, and to leave
the rest of Greece to the mercy of the conqueror. The Athenians, however,
whose country lay with∣out the Isthmus, remonstrated loudly against
this desertion, and endeavoured to persuade the Greeks to face the enemy in
the plain. But prudence prevailed, and Themistocles gave them to understand
that though their country should be for a while over-run by the barbarous
invader, yet they had still their wooden walls to rely on, for their fleet
was <PB N="147" REF="150"/> ready to transport them to such of their
settle∣ments as they thought proper. At first, how∣ever, this advice was
the most hateful that could be imagined. The people thought themselves
inevitably lost if they should once abandon the temples of their gods, and
the tombs of their ancestors. But Themistocles using all his eloquence
and address to work upon their passions, represented to them that
Athens did not consist either of its walls or its houses but of its
citizens, and that the saving of these was the true preservation of the
state. A decree therefore was passed, by which it was ordained, that
Athens for a while should be given up in trust to the gods, and that all
the inhabitants, whether in freedom or slavery, should embark on board the
fleet. In this ca∣lamitous desertion Cimon, though very young, was seen
encouraging the citizens by his words and example. Bearing in his hands a part
of his horse's furniture, he went to offer it as now useless in the
temple of Minerva, and then going down to the water-side was the first that
cheerfully went on board. When he was followed by the rest of the city, so
moving and melancholy a sight drew tears even from the most obdurate. A
brave, generous, po∣lite, and ancient people, now forced from their 
<PB N="148" REF="151"/> native seats to undergo all the vicissitudes and
dangers of the sea, to implore a retreat from fo∣reign states, and give up
their native lands to the spoiler was a most moving spectacle. Yet the
stea∣diness and courage of some, and the pious resig∣nation of all,
demanded the utmost admiration. The young and adventurous embarked for
Sa∣lamis, the old, the women, and children, took shelter at the city of
Trezene, the inhabitants of which generously offered them an asylum. They
even allowed them a maintenance at the ex∣pence of the public, permitted their
children to gather fruit wherever they pleased, and ap∣pointed masters for
their instruction. But in this general desertion, that which extremely
raised the compassion of all, was the great number of old men they were
obliged to leave in the city on account of their age and infir∣mities. Many
also voluntarily remained be∣hind, believing that the citadel which they had
fortisied with wooden ramparts, was what the oracle pointed out for general
security. To heighten this scene of general distress, the matrons were
seen clinging with fond affection to the places in which they had so long
resided, the wives filled the streets with loud lamen∣tations, and even the
poor domestic animals seemed to take a part in the general concern. 
<PB N="149" REF="152"/> It was impossible to see these poor creatures
run howling and crying after their masters, who were going on shipboard,
without being strongly asfected. Among these, the faithful∣ness of a
particular dog is recorded, who jumped into the sea after his master, and
con∣tinued swimming as near as he could to the vessel till he landed at
Salamis, and died the moment after upon the shore. Those few in∣habitants
that remained behind retired into the citadel, where, literally interpreting
the oracle, they fortified it as well as they could, and pa∣tiently awaited the
invader's approach.</P>
<P>Whilst Xerxes was continuing his march, he was told that the
Grecians were employed in seeing the games and combats then celebrating at
Olympia. It was not without indignation that he found his power so little
able to ter∣rify his enemies, or interrupt their amuse∣ments. Having sent
off a considerable de∣tachment of his army to plunder the temple at Delphos,
with the rest he marched down into Attica, where he found Athens deserted
of all but a few in the citadel. These men despairing of succour, and
unwilling to sur∣vive the loss of their country, would listen to no terms
of accommodation; they boldly withstood the first assault, and, warmed
by <PB N="150" REF="153"/> the enthusiasm of religion, began to hope for
success. But a second assault carried their feeble out-works, they
were all put to the sword, and the citadel reduced to ashes. Flushed with
this success, Xerxes immediately dispatched a messenger to Susa
with the news of his victories, and, at the same time, sent him a great
number of pictures and statues, among which were those of Harmodius and
Aristogiton.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the confederate Greeks summoned a council of war
to consult upon the proper manner and place of opposing this barbarous
inundation. With respect to the operations by land, it was universally
deter∣mined to defend the isthmus by a wall, and Cleombrotus, the brother of
Leonidas, was appointed to command that station; but as to the operations at
sea, these were not so generally agreed on. Eurybiades the Spartan, who
was appointed to the command of the fleet, was for having it advance near the
isth∣mus, that it might co-operate with the army at land, but Themistocles
was entirely of an∣other opinion, and asserted, that it would be the most
manifest error to abandon so advan∣tageous a post as that of Salamis,
where they were then stationed. They were now, he said, in 
<PB N="151" REF="154"/> possession of the narrow seas, where the
num∣ber of the enemy could never avail them; that the only hope now left the
Athenians was their fleet, and that this must not be capriciously given up
by ignorance to the enemy. Eurybiades, who considered himself as glanced
at, could not contain his resent∣ment, but offered to strike Themistocles
for his insolence. 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>Strike me,</HI> cried the Athenian, <HI>strike
me, but hear me.</HI></Q> His moderation and his reasoning prevailed, the
generals were re∣conciled to each other, and the result of the council was,
that they should prepare to re∣ceive the Persians on the Isthmus by land,
and in the streights of Salamis by sea.</P>
<P>Mean while Xerxes, after having demolished and burnt Athens,
marched down toward the sea to act in conjunction with his fleet, which he
had determined should once more come to an engagement with that of the enemy.
This was what Themistocles most ardently desired in his present
situation, but he was fearful his confederates would not have courage to
abide the encounter. Their thoughts were still bent upon sailing towards
the isthmus, and assisting their army in case of distress.
Themistocles, therefore, in this exigence, was obliged to have recourse to
one of those stratagems which <PB N="152" REF="155"/> mark superiority of
genius; he contrived to let Xerxes privately understand, that the
con∣federates were now assembled at Salamis pre∣paring for flight, and that
it would be an easy task to attack and destroy them. This infor∣mation
was attended with the desired success. Xerxes gave orders to his fleet to
surround Salamis by night, in order to prevent an escape which he so much
dreaded.</P>
<P>In this manner the Grecian fleet was blocked up, and no safety
remained but in intrepidity and conquest. Even Themistocles himself was
not apprized of the situation of his own forces and that of the enemy, all
the narrow streights were blocked up, and the rest of the Persian fleet
was sent for, to make every passage im∣practicable. In this exigence
Aristides, in whose bosom the love of his country always prevailed over
every private revenge, was re∣solved to venture all, in order to apprize
The∣mistocles of his situation and danger. He was then at Egina, where he
had some forces under his command, and with very great dan∣ger ventured in a
small boat through all the fleet of the enemies by night. Upon landing he
made up to the tent of Themistocles, and addressed him in the following
manner: 
<Q REND="inline">"If we are wise, Themistocles, we shall
hencesorth <PB N="153" REF="156"/> lay aside those vain and puerile
dissensions which have thitherto separated us. One strife, and a
noble emulation it is, now re∣mains for us, which of us shall be most
serviceable to our country. It is yours to command as a general, it is mine
to obey as a subject, and happy shall I be, if my ad∣vice can any way
contribute to your and my country's glory."</Q> He then informed him of the
fleet's real situation, and warmly exhorted him to give battle without delay.
Themisto∣cles felt all that generous gratitude which so disinterested a
conduct demanded, and eager to shew a return of noble friendship, let him
into all his projects and aims, particularly this last, of suffering
himself to be surrounded. After this they used their joint authority with
the other commanders to persuade them to engage, and accordingly both fleets
prepared themselves for battle.</P>
<P>The Grecian fleet consisted of three hundred and eighty ships,
the Persian fleet was much more numerous. But whatever advantage they had in
numbers, and the size of their shipping, they fell infinitely short of
the Greeks in their naval skill, and their acquain∣ance with the seas where
they fought; but it was particularly in their commander that the Greeks 
<PB N="154" REF="157"/> had the advantage. Eurybiades had nominal∣ly the conduct
of the fleet, but Themistocles in reality conducted all their operations.
No∣thing escaped his vigilance, and he knew how to improve every incident to
the greatest ad∣vantage. He, therefore, deferred the onset until a wind,
which at that time of the year was periodical, and which he knew would be
fa∣vourable, set in. As soon as this arose, the signal was given for
battle, and the Grecian fleet sailed forward in exact order.</P>
<P>Xerxes imputing his former ill success at sea to his own
absence, was resolved to be a wit∣ness of the present engagement from
the top of a promontory, where he caused a throne to be erected for that
purpose. This served in some measure to animate his forces, who,
conscious of their king's observance, resolved to merit his applause.
The Persians, therefore, ad∣vanced with such courage and impetuosity, as
struck the enemy with terror, but their ardour abated when the engagement
became closer. The numerous disadvantages of their circum∣stances and
situation then began to appear. The wind blew directly in their faces; the
height and heaviness of their vessels rendered them unwieldy and
useless, even the number of their ships in the narrow sea where they 
<PB N="155" REF="158"/> fought, only served to embarrass and encrease
their confusion. The Ionians, whom Themis∣tocles had implored by characters
engraven along the rocks of their coast, to remember from whence they derived
their original, were the first who betook themselves to flight. In the
other wing the contest was for some time doubtful, until the Phoenicians
and Cyprians being driven on shore, the rest retired in great disorder,
and fell foul of each other in their retreat. In this total defection,
Artemisa alone seemed to stop the progress of victory; and, at the head
of her five ships, performed incredi∣ble acts of valour. Xerxes, who was a
specta∣tor of her conduct, could not help crying out, that his soldiers
behaved like women in the conslict, and the women like soldiers. As this
queen, from her signal intrepidity, was become very obnoxious to the
Athenians, a price had been set upon her head; sensible of which, as
she was upon the point of falling into their hands, by a lucky turn of
thought, she pretended to desert from her own party, and to fall foul of
one of their ships; the Grecks thus concluding, that she either belonged to
them, or was a deserter, permitted her to escape. In the mean time, the
confederates pursued the Persian fleet on every side; some 
<PB N="156" REF="159"/> were intercepted at the streights of Attica, many were
sunk, and more taken. Above two hundred were burnt, all the rest were
dis∣persed; and the allies dreading the resentment of the Greeks, as well
as of the Persian king, made the best of their way to their own
country.</P>
<P>Such was the success of the battle of Salamis, in which the
Persians had received a severer blow than they had ever hitherto
experienced from Greece. Themistocles, in a secret con∣versation with
Aristides, was, or pretended to be so elated, as to propose breaking down
the bridge by which Xerxes had made his way into Europe. Whether Themistocles
was really sincere in the proposal, remains a doubt, but Aristides used
all his powers to persuade his coadjutor from such an undertaking. He
represented to him the danger of reducing so powerful an enemy to
desperation, and assert∣ed, that it was his wish to be relieved from
such an intruder with all possible dispatch. Themistocles at once
acquiesced in his reasons; and, in order to hasten the king's departure,
contrived to have him secretly informed that the Grecians designed to break
down the bridge.</P>
<P>The situation of Xerxes was such, that the smallest
repulse was now sufficient to wean him <PB N="157" REF="160"/> from his
darling expedition. Astonished at the late overthrow, and alarmed at this
new information, he only wanted a decent oppor∣tunity to retreat, when
Mardonius came con∣veniently to extricate him from his embarrass∣ments. He
began by extenuating the late loss, and the many expedients that remained to
re∣lieve their situation, he laid all the blame of their defeat upon the
cowardice of the auxilia∣ries, and their insincere attachment to his cause.
He advised him to return speedily to his kingdom, lest the fame of his
ill-success, which always represents things worse than they are,
should occasion any commotions in his absence. He engaged, if he would
leave him three hundred thousand of his choice troops, to subdue all Greece
with glory. On the other hand, if the event proved otherwise, he would take
all the blame of miscarriage, and suffer in person if it were to retrieve
the honour of his master. This advice was very well received by Xerxes, who,
thinking enough had been given to glory, when he had made himself master of
Athens, prepared to return to Persia at the head of a part of his army,
leaving the other part of it with Mardonius, not so much with the hope of
reducing Greece, as through the fear of be∣ing pursued.</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="161"/> These resolutions were communicated in a
council held soon after the fight, and the night following the fleet set
sail in great confusion to∣wards the Hellespont, and took up their
win∣ter quarters at Cuma. The king himself, leaving his generals to take care
of the army, hastened with a small retinue to the sea-side, which he
reached forty-five days after the battle of Salamis. When he arrived at the
place, he found the bridge broken down by the violence of the waves in a
tempest that had lately happened there. He was, therefore, obliged to pass
the streight in a small boat, which manner of returning, being compared to
the ostentatious method in which he had set out, rendered his disgrace
still more poignant and afflicting. The army which he had or∣dered to follow
him, having been unprovided with provisions, suffered great hardships by
the way. After having consumed all the corn they could find, they were
obliged to live upon herbs, and even upon the bark and leaves of trees. Thus
harrassed and fatigued, a pestilence begun to complete their misery;
and, after a fatiguing journey of forty-five days, in which they were pursued
rather by vultures and beasts of prey, than by men, they came to the
Hellespont, where they crossed over, and <PB N="159" REF="162" MS="y"/>
marched from thence to Sardis. Such was the end of Xerxes' expedition into
Greece. A mea∣sure begun in pride, and terminating in infamy. It is to be
observed, however, that we have all this account from the Greek writers only,
who no doubt have been partial to their country∣men. I am told, that the
Persian historians represent this expedition in a very different light,
and say that the king was recalled in the midst of his successes to
quell an insurrection at home. Be this as it will, the affairs of Persia
seemed after that to go backward, until the time when Alexander led a
conquering army of Greeks to invade them in turn.</P>

<DIV1 N="7" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. V. From the Retreat of XERXES to the Peace concluded
between the GREEKS and PERSIANS.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A. M. 3524.</NOTE> THE earliest object the
Greeks took care of after the battle of Salamis, was to send the first
fruits of the rich spoil they had taken from the Persians to Delphos.
Considered in a con∣federated light, they were ever attentive to the duties
of religion; and though their sects and opinions in philosophy, taught
mankind to <PB N="160" REF="163"/> entertain but very mean ideas of the objects
of public worship, yet it was religion that form∣ed their bond of union, and
for a while held them feebly together. When that bond came to be broken, and
the council of the Amphyc∣tions became rather a political than a religious
assembly, the general union no longer prevail∣ed, and the different
states fell a sacrifice to their own contentions.</P>
<P>The joy of the Greeks upon this victory was general and loud; every
commander had his share of honour, but the glory of Themistocles eclipsed
that of all the rest. It was a custom in Greece, that after a battle the
commanding officers should declare who had distinguished themselves
most, by writing the names of such as merited the first and second
rewards. On this occasion each officer concerned adjudged the first rank to
himself, but all allowed the second to Themistocles, which was, in fact,
a tacit superiority. This was farther confirmed by the Lacedaemonians, who
carried him in triumph to Sparta; and having adjudged the rewards of valour to
their own countryman, Eurybiades, adjudged that of wisdom to The∣mistocles.
They crowned him with olive, presented him with a rich chariot, and
con∣ducted him with three hundred horse to the <PB N="161" REF="164" MS="y"/>
confines of their state. But still there was an homage paid him that
flattered his pride yet more: when he appeared at the Olympic games, the
spectators received him with un∣common acclamations. As soon as he appear-
the whole assembly rose up to do him honour: nobody regarded either the
games or the com∣batants, Themistocles was the only spectacle worth their
attention. Struck with such flat∣tering honours, he could not help
observing, that he that day reaped the fruits of all his labours.</P>
<P>After the Grecians were returned from pur∣suing the Persian
fleet, Themistocles sailed to all the islands that had espoused their
interests, in order to levy contributions. The first he applied to was that
of Andros, from whose in∣habitants he required a considerable sum. 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>I come,</HI> said he, <HI>to you accompanied
by two very powerful divinities, Persuasion and Necessity.</HI></Q> 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>Alas!</HI> replied they, <HI>we also have
divinities on our side, Poverty and Impossibility.</HI></Q> In
consequence of this reply, he blocked them up for some time, but finding
them too well fortified, he was obliged to retire. Some other islands,
however, were neither furnished with so much reason or so much power.
He exacted large sums from all such as were incapable of opposition; and 
<PB N="162" REF="165"/> these contributions he chiefly converted to his own
private advantage, thus shewing in his own character two very oddly
assorted qualities, ava∣rice and ambition.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Mardonius, who remain∣ed in Greece with a body of
three hundred thousand men, passed the winter in Thessaly; and, in
the beginning of spring, led them down into the province of Boeotia. From
thence he sent Alexander, king of Macedonia, with a splendid retinue to
Athens, to make proposals for an accommodation, and to endea∣vour to make
them separate their interests from the general cause of Greece. He
offered to re∣build their city, to give them a considerable sum of money,
to suffer them to enjoy their laws and constitution, and to give them the
government of all Greece. Aristides was at that time in the highest office,
being principal archon at Athens. It was in his presence that the king of
Macedon made his proposals, and that the deputies from the other states of
Greece endeavoured to avert the force of them. But Aristides wanted no
prompter but the na∣tural dictates of his own heart to give them an answer. 
<Q REND="inline">"To men, said he, bred up to plea∣sure and
ignorance, it is natural to prosser great rewards, and to hope by bribes to
buy off <PB N="163" REF="166"/> virtue. Barbarians who make silver and gold
the chief objects of their esteem, may be ex∣cused for thinking to corrupt
the fidelity of every people, but that the Lacedaemonians, who came to
remonstrate against these offers, should suppose they could prevail
was in∣deed surprising. The Athenians have the common liberty of Greece
intrusted to their care, and mountains of gold are not able to shake its
fidelity. No, so long as that sun which the Persians adore continues to
shine with wonted splendor, so long shall the Athenians be mortal
enemies to the Persians, so long shall they continue to pursue them for
ravaging their lands, for burning their houses, and po∣luting their temples:
such is the answer we return to the Persian proposal; and you,"
con∣tinued he, addressing himself to Alexander, "if you are truly their
friend, refrain for the fu∣ture from being the bearer of such proposals,
your honour, and perhaps even your safety demands it."</Q></P>
<P>All treaty being thus broke up, Mardonius prepared to act with
vigour, and invaded Atti∣ca, which the Athenians were once more ob∣liged to
desert and leave to his fury. He en∣tered Athens ten months after it had been
taken by Xerxes, the inhabitants having again <PB N="164" REF="167"/> conveyed
themselves to Salamis, and other neighbouring places. In that state of
exile and want, they continued contented with all their sufferings, since
repaid by freedom. Even Lycidas, a senator, who attempted to propose a
submission, was stoned to death, while his wife and children met with
the same fate from the women, so strong was the aversion which the
Athenians had conceived against all com∣munications with Persia.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the Spartans, whose duty it was to co-operate
with the Athenians with equal ardour, unmindful of the general cause, only
thought of making preparations for their own security, and resolved to
fortify the isthmus, in order to hinder the enemy from entering into
Peloponnesus. This the Atheni∣ans considered as a base and ungrateful
defec∣tion, and sent deputies to remonstrate against the Spartan conduct.
These had orders to say, that if Sparta would persist in its partial
method of seeking security, the Athenians would follow their example; and,
instead of suffering all for Greece, would turn with their sleet to the
Persians, who being thus masters of the sea, could invade the territory
of Sparta whenever they should think proper. These menaces had so good an
effect, that five thou∣sand <PB N="165" REF="168"/> men were privately
dispatched, each at∣tended with seven Helotes, and were actually upon their
march before the Spartans gave the Athenian deputies any answer.</P>
<P>Mardonius had left Attica at this time, and was on his return to the
country of Boeotia, where he resolved to await the approach of the enemy, as
he could there draw up his forces with greater ease than in the hilly parts
of Attica, where a few might be opposed to numbers with greater success.
He encamped by the river Asopus, along the banks of which his army extended,
consisting of three hundred thousand fighting men.</P>
<P>Great as this army was, the Greeks, with much inferior forces,
resolved to meet it in the field. Their forces were by this time
as∣sembled, and amounted to seventy thousand men. Of these, five
thousand were Spartans, attended by thirty-five thousand Helotes. The
Athenians amounted to eight thousand, and the troops of the allies made up
the remainder. In the right wing of this army the Spartans were placed,
commanded by Cleombrotus, in the left wing the Athenians, with Aristides at
their head. In this order they followed Mar∣donius into Boeotia, determined on
trying the fate of a battle, and encamped at no great <PB N="166" REF="169"/>
distance from them, at the foot of Mount Cythaeron. Here they continued for
some time, awaiting in dreadful suspense a battle that was to determine
the fate of Greece. Some skirmishing between the Persian cavalry and the
wing of the Grecian army, in which the latter were successful, seemed to
give a presage of future victory, which, however, for ten days neither side
seemed willing to strike for.</P>
<P>While the two armies were thus opposed, waiting the most
favourable opportunity of engaging, the Greeks, by their mutual
dissen∣sions, were upon the point of losing their free∣dom in
satisfying their mutual jealousy. The first dispute that arose in the
army, was begun by the Tegeans, who contended with the Athe∣nians upon the
point of precedence. They willingly allowed the Spartans the command of the
right wing, as they constantly had it, but they insisted on having the
left, alledging, that they had earned it by former acts of va∣lour and well
known success. The dispute ran high, a mutinous disposition began to
prevail in all parts of the army, and the enemy were likely to become
victorious without a blow. In this general spirit of dissension,
Aristides alone appeared unmoved. Long noted for <PB N="167" REF="170"/> his
impartiality and justice, all parties fixed their eyes upon him as the only
moderator from whom they could expect satisfaction. Wherefore, turning
himself to the Spartans, and some of the rest of the confederates, he
addressed them in the following manner. 
<Q REND="inline">"It is not now a time, my friends, to dispute of
the merit of past services, for all boasting is vain in the day of
danger. Let it be the brave man's pride to rest assured, that it is not
the post or station which gives courage, or which can take it away. I head
the Athenians, what∣ever post you shall assign us we will maintain it,
and make our station, wherever we are placed, the post of true honour and
military glory. We are come hither not to contend with our friends, but to
fight with our ene∣mies; not to boast of our ancestors, but to imitate
them. This battle will distinguish the particular merit of each city, each
commander, and even the lowest centinel will share the ho∣nour of the
day."</Q> This speech determined the council of war in favour of the
Athenians, who, thereupon, were allowed to maintain their for∣mer
station.</P>
<P>A fatal conspiracy in the midst of the Athe∣nians threatened
consequences still more danger∣ous, as they were unseen. Some of the
best and <PB N="168" REF="171"/> richest families, who had wasted their
fortunes in the war, and lost their credit in the city, en∣tered into a
confederacy to deliver up Greece into the hands of the Persians Aristides,
however, still watchful in the service of the state, was early informed
of their machinations, and instantly laid their schemes before the ge∣neral
council. Notwithstanding he was con∣tented with having eight of the
conspirators arrested; and, of these, two only were reserved for trial.
Yet his lenity, or, to call it by a truer name, his prudence, would not permit
him to act rigorously even against these; as he knew that severity in
times of general danger would but depress the ardour of the army, he
permitted them to escape, and thus sacrificed public justice to public
security.</P>
<P>Both armies had now continued for ten days in sight of each other,
in anxious expectation of an engagement, both willing to begin, yet afraid to
strike, as the aggressor was to engage at a disadvantage. But Mardonius
being na∣turally of an impatient, fiery disposition, grew very uneasy at
so long a delay. Besides, he had only few provisions left for his army,
and the Grecians grew every day stronger by the addition of fresh
supplies. He, therefore, called a council of war to deliberate whether 
<PB N="169" REF="172"/> he should give battle. Artabazus, a person of
singular merit and great experience, was of opinion that they should not
hazard a battle, but that they should retire under the walls of Thebes, while
the enemy, formed of various troops, and subject to different leaders, would
destroy each other by their own dissensions, or might be partly
corrupted to give up the common cause. This opinion was the most
reasonable, but Mardonius, spurred on by his natural impetuosity, and
wearied with a pro∣tracted war, resolved to engage, nor had the rest
courage to contradict his resolution. The result, therefore, was that they
should give battle the next day.</P>
<P>This being resolved on the side of Persia, the Greeks were not
less prepared for the en∣gagement, for they had been secretly apprized the
night before by Alexander king of Mace∣don of the result of the Persian
councils. Pau∣sanias, therefore, gave orders to his army to prepare
themselves for battle, and draw∣ing up his forces, placed the Athenians on
the right, as being better acquainted with the Persian manner of fighting,
and flushed with former success. Whether it was fear or prudence that
suggested this change to the ge∣neral, the Athenians took the post of
honour <PB N="170" REF="173"/> with exultation; nothing was heard among them but
mutual exhortations to bravery, and a steady resolution to conquer or fall.
But Mardonius hearing of this alteration in the disposition of the Grecian
army, made an alter∣ation also in his own. This also once more produced a
change in the disposition of the Greeks; by this changing and rechanging
the order of battle, nothing farther was done for that day.</P>
<P>At night the Greeks held a council of war, in which it was
resolved, that they should de∣camp from their present situation, and
march to another, more conveniently situated for wa∣ter. As their removal was
performed in the night, much disorder ensued; and in the morning, Mardonius
perceiving them scattered over the plain, he supposed that they were
fly∣ing, rather than retreating; he, therefore, re∣solved to pursue with
his whole army. The Greeks perceiving his design, soon collected their
scattered forces, which the darkness had dispersed, but not
intimidated, and halting near the little city of Platea, there determined to
await the shock of their pursuers. The bar∣barian forces soon came up to
the engage∣ment with their accustomed howling, expect∣ing rather to plunder
than to fight. The La∣cedaemonians, <PB N="171" REF="174"/> who closed up the
rear of the Grecian army, were the first who supported the shock of the
assailants. They were in some measure separated from the rest of
the army by the obstinacy of one of their own re∣giments, who considered
their retreat as con∣trary to the idea of Spartan discipline, but still
consisting of a formidable body of men, they were in a capacity of making
head against the invaders. Collecting themselves into a phalanx, they
stood impenetrable and immov∣able to all the assaults of the enemy.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the Athenian troops who were apprized of the
attack, quickly turned back, in order to assist their allies; but the
Greeks, who were in Persian pay, to the number of five thousand intercepted
their return. Thus, the battle was divided into two, and fought with great
ardour in various parts of the field. But nothing could resist the weight
of the Spartan phalanx, who, after some time, broke in upon the Persian
forces, and put them into disorder. In this tumult, Mardonius attempt∣ing to
restore the order of battle, and rushing into the midst of the carnage,
was killed by Aimnestus, a Spartan; and soon after all his army betook
themselves to flight. The other Greek troops soon followed the brave
example <PB N="172" REF="175"/> set them by Sparta, and the rout became
ge∣neral. Artabazus, who commanded a body of forty thousand Persians, fled
with them to∣wards the Hellespont, while the rest fortified themselves in
their camp with wooden ram∣parts. There they were attacked by the Spar∣tans,
but being not well-skilled in that part of war, the Athenians soon came up
to their assist∣ance, and soon effected a breach in this hasty
rampart. It was then that the slaughter of the enemy was indiscriminate and
terrible. Of all the Persian army that had taken refuge there, not four
thousand men escaped. Above an hundred thousand men were put to the
sword; and the conquerors, willing to rid their coun∣try at once of their
terrible invaders, refused to give quarter. Thus ended the Persian
inva∣sions of Greece, nor ever after was the Persian army seen to cross
the Hellespont.</P>
<P>The carnage being at last over, the Greeks buried their dead,
which at most did not amount to ten thousand men; and soon after, as a
testimony of their gratitude to Heaven, they caused a statue of Jupiter
to made at the general expence, which they placed in his temple at Olympia. The
names of the several nations of Greece that were present in the
en∣gagement, were engraven on the right side of <PB N="173" REF="176"/> the
pedestal of the statue, the Spartans first, the Athenians next, and all
the rest in order.</P>
<P>In the mean time, while success attended the Grecian arms upon
land, they were not less fortunate at sea. The greatest part of the
Per∣sian fleet, after the defeat at Salamis, wintered at Cumae, and in the
spring moved to Samos, both to guard and awe the coasts of Asia. The
Grecians, in the mean while, were refitting their ships at Aegina, and being
importuned by the Samians, they put to sea under the con∣duct of Leotichydes,
the Spartan, and Xan∣thippus, the Athenian. The Persians appris∣ed of their
approaching, and having long ex∣perienced their own inferiority, would not
venture to oppose them at sea, but drew up their ships upon land at
Mycale, a promon∣tory of lonia, where they fortified them with a wall and a
deep trench, while they were also protected by an army of sixty thousand
foot, under the command of Tigranes. This, how∣ever, did not deter the Greeks
from venturing to attack them. Leotichydes having endea∣voured to make the
Ionians revolt, landed his forces, and the next day prepared for the
as∣sault. He drew up his army in two bodies; the one consisting chiefly
of Athenians and <PB N="174" REF="177"/> Corinthians, kept the plain, whilst
the other of Lacedaemonians, marched over the hills and precipices, to gain the
highest ground. The battle being joined, great courage and resolu∣tion was
shewn on both sides, and the fortune of the day continued for a long time
in sus∣pense. The defection of the Greek auxiliaries in the Persian
army, turned the fate of the battle; the Persians were soon routed, and
pursued with great slaughter to their very tents. The Athenians had made
themselves masters of the field before the Lacedaemonians could come up to
their assistance, so that all the share these had in the action,
was to dis∣perse some Persian troops which were attempt∣ing to make a
regular retreat, soon after their ramparts were forced, and all their
vessels burnt, so that nothing could be more com∣plete than the victory
at Mycale. Tigranes, the Persian general, and forty thousand men of his
army, lay dead on the field of battle; the fleet was destroyed, and of the
great army brought into Europe by Xerxes, scarce one re∣mained to bring back
the tidings.</P>
<P>The battle of Platea was fought in the morn∣ing, and that of Mycale
in the evening of the same day. But what is very extraordinary, it is
universally assirmed, that the victory at <PB N="175" REF="178"/> Plataea
was known at Mycale before the battle begun, though it is a passage of
several days from one place to the other. It is most pro∣bable, that
Leotychides made use of the report to encourage his army, and incite them to
emulate their associates in the cause of freedom.</P>
<P>During these misfortunes, Xerxes, who had been the cause of all,
lay at Sardis expect∣ing the event of his expedition, but every hour coming
loaded with the news of some fatal disaster, finding himself unable to
retrieve his affairs, he retired farther into the country, and endeavoured to
drown in luxury and riot the uneasy reflections of his successless
ambition. To the want of success abroad, was added the contempt of his
subjects at home; and this brought on a train of treasons, insurrections,
sacrilege, murder, incest, and cruelty; so that the latter part of his
reign was as scandalous as the first part of it had been unfortunate.</P>
<P>The Grecian fleet after the battle of Mycale set sail towards
the Hellespont, in order to possess themselves of the bridges which
Xerxes had built over that streight, but finding them already destroyed by
the tempestuous weather, they returned home. From this time, all the cities
of Ionia revolted from the Persians, and having entered into the general
consederacy, <PB N="176" REF="179"/> most of them preserved their liberty
during the time that empire subsisted.</P>
<P>The treasures which the Persians had brought into Greece were
very great, and these of consequence, became a prey to the conquerors. From
this period, the Greeks began to lose their spirit of hardy and labori∣ous
virtue, and to adopt the refined indolence, the captious petulance, and the
boundless love of pleasure, which extreme wealth is ever known to produce.
The former equality of the people now began to be broken, and while one part of
the inhabitants rioted in opu∣lence and luxury, another was seen pining in
want and despair. It was in vain that philo∣sophy reared its head to stop
these calamities; its voice reaches to but a few; the great and the little
vulgar are equally deaf to its dictates. From this time we are to view a
different pic∣ture; and, instead of a brave and refined peo∣ple confederating
against tyranny, we are to be∣hold an ennervate and factious populace, a
cor∣rupt administration among those in power, and wealth alone making
distinction.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. From the Victory at MYCALE to the Beginning of the
PELOPONNESSIAN War.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A. M. 3526.</NOTE> NO sooner were the Greeks
freed from the apprehensions of a foreign invasion, than they began to
entertain jealousies of each other. In∣deed these petty animosities had
all along sub∣sisted among them, but they were kept under by the
sense of general danger. As this col∣lection of republics was composed of
states entirely dissimilar in manners, interests and in∣clinations, it
was no way surprising to find its parts ever at variance with each other.
The first marks of jealousy upon the destruction of the Persian army,
exhibited themselves between the Athenians and Spartans. The one a refin∣ed
ambitious state, unwilling to admit a supe∣rior in the general confederacy,
the other an hardy unpolished race, which could never think of admitting a
feebler state as an equal. The Athenians, with their families, being returned
to their own country, began to think of re∣building their city, which had been
almost de∣stroyed <PB N="178" REF="181"/> during the Persian war. As every
new foundation aims at improving the old, they laid a plan of strengthening
and extending their walls, and giving their city at once more mag∣nificence and
security. This was but natural, however the Lacedaemonians conceived a
jea∣lousy at this undertaking, and began to think that Athens, from being
mistress of the seas, would soon attempt usurping all authority up∣on
land. They, therefore, sent an embassy to the Athenians to dissuade
them from this undertaking, giving as an ostensible reason, the danger
such fortifications would be of to the general confederacy if they should
ever fall in∣to the hands of the Persians. This message at first
appeared reasonable, and the Athenians put an immediate stop to their
undertaking; but Themistocles, who since the battle of Sala∣mis continued
to guide in the assemblies of Athens, easily saw through the pretext,
and advised the council to meet their dissimulation with similar
address. He, therefore, answer∣ed the Spartan ambassadors, that the
Atheni∣ans would soon send an embassy to Lacedaemon, in which they
would fully satisfy all their scruples. Having thus gained time, he
pro∣cured himself to be elected for that important negociation, and took care
to draw out the <PB N="179" REF="182"/> treaty by studied delays. He had
previously desired that his colleagues should follow one after another,
and still he alledged at Lacedae∣mon that he only waited for their arrival to
de∣termine the affair at a single audience. Dur∣ing all this time the work
was carried on at Athens with the utmost vigour and industry, the women and
children, strangers and slaves, were all employed in it, nor was it
interrupt∣ed for a single day. It was in vain that the Spartans complained of
this procedure; it was in vain that they urged Themistocles to hasten his
business, he stedfastly denied the fact, and entreated them not to give
any credit to loose and idle reports. He desired they would send again
and enquire into the truth of the matter; and, at the same time, advised
the Athenians to detain the Spartan envoys until he and his collegues should
return. At last, finding all his pretences for delay ex∣hausted, he boldly
demanded an audience, and knowing that the work was finished, he no longer
kept on the mask. He then informed the Spartans in full council, that Athens
was now in a condition to keep out any enemy, whether foreign or domestic:
that what his countrymen had done was conformable both to the law of nations,
and the common interests of <PB N="180" REF="183"/> Greece. Every city had a
right to consult for its own safety, without submitting to the ad∣vice or
controul of its neighbours; that what had been done was entirely in
consequence of his advice; and, in short, that whatever injury they offered
him, they must expect it would be returned upon their own ambassadors,
who were still detained at Athens. These declara∣tions extremely
displeased the Lacedaemonians, but, either sensible of their truth, or
unwilling to come to an open rupture, they dissembled their resentment,
and the ambassadors on both sides having all suitable honours paid
them, re∣turned to their respective cities. Themistocles was received with
as much joy by his fellow ci∣tizens as if he had returned from triumph, and he
was of a disposition to feel those honours with the highest
delight.</P>
<P>Having thus taken proper precautions for securing the city, his
next care was to strengthen the port, and form an harbour at once spacious
and secure. He likewise obtained a decree, that every year they should
build twenty ves∣sels to continue and augment their force by sea; and, in
order to engage the greater num∣ber of workmen and sailors to resort to
Athens, he caused particular privileges and immunities to be granted in their
favour. His design was <PB N="181" REF="184"/> to render Athens entirely a
maritime city, in which he followed a very different system of politics
from their former governors, who bent all their efforts to alienate the minds
of the peo∣ple from commerce and naval affairs.</P>
<P>But as success in one part is apt to lead on to designs
still more extensive, Themisto∣cles was willing to outstep the bounds
of jus∣tice in the prosecution of his darling projects. He even formed a
plan of supplanting Sparta, and making Athens the unrivalled mistress of
Greece. On a certain day, therefore, he de∣clared in a full assembly of the
people, that he had a very important design to propose, but which could not
be communicated to the pub∣lic, as the execution required secrecy and
dis∣patch. He, therefore, desired they would ap∣point a person to whom he
might explain himself, one whose judgment might direct, and whose
authority might confirm him in his design. To direct in a matter of this
importance, it was not easy to miss the wisest and the best man of
the state, and Aristides was unanimously cho∣sen by the whole
assembly, as the properest per∣son to weigh the justice as well as
the utility of the proposal. Themistocles, therefore, tak∣ing him aside,
told him, that the design he had conceived was to burn the fleet belonging 
<PB N="182" REF="185"/> to the rest of the Grecian states, which then lay in
a neighbouring port, and thus procure Athens an undisputed sovereignty of
the sea. Aristides, inwardly displeased at the proposal, made no
answer, but returning to the assembly, informed them, that nothing could
be more advantageous to Athens than what Themisto∣cles proposed, but that
nothing could be more unjust. The people, still possessed of a
share of remaining virtue, unanimously declined the proposal without
knowing its contents, and conferred the surname of <HI>Just</HI> upon
Aristides, a title still the more flattering, as he had so well
deserved it.</P>
<P>Thus, Athens being restored to peace and security, once more
began to apply to those arts that adorn life and secure freedom. The people
began to assume a greater share in the government of the state than
they had hither∣to aspired at, and steps were every day taken to render the
constitution entirely popular. Aristides perceived this, and justly
dreaded the consequences of a democratic government; he, therefore, procured
a decree, that the archons who were the chief magistrates of the state,
should be chosen indiscriminately from all ranks of Athenians without
distinction. Thus, by indulging the citizens in a part of 
<PB N="183" REF="186"/> their wishes, he secured a legal subordination
among the whole.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the Grecians, encourag∣ed by their former
victories, resolved to send a fleet to deliver their confederates, who
still groaned beneath the Persian yoke. Pausanias commanded the Spartan
fleet, while Aristides, and Cimon, the son of Miltiades, were ap∣pointed to
conduct the fleets of Athens. This was the first time the latter, who was yet
very young, was placed in a sphere for the exhibi∣tion of his virtues. He had
formerly suffered himself to be imprisoned towards the satisfying his
father's fine, and his piety upon that occa∣sion gave the most favourable
presage of his future greatness. When set at liberty, his ser∣vices in
war soon became conspicuous, and it was seen that he acted with the
courage of his father, the judgment of Themistocles, and with more
sincerity than either. The ingenu∣ous openness of his temper being easily
seen, he was opposed in the state as a counterpoise to the craft and
subtlety of Themistocles, and thus advanced to the highest employments
both at home and abroad. Under these com∣manders, the allied fleet first
directed their course to the isle of Cyprus, where they restor∣ed all the
cities to their liberty; then steering <PB N="184" REF="187"/> towards the
Hellespont, attacked the city By∣zantium, of which they made themselves
mas∣ters, and took a vast number of prisoners, many of whom were the
richest and most consider∣able families of Persia.</P>
<P>The success of this expedition was not more flattering to the
Greeks than in the end preju∣dicial to them. A deluge of wealth pouring in,
corrupted the simplicity, and tainted the manners of every rank of people.
The Athe∣nians already skilled in the arts of politeness and effeminacy,
concealed their change for a time, but it soon broke out among the Spar∣tans,
and Pausanias himself, their commander, was the first infected with the
contagion. Be∣ing naturally of an haughty and imperious temper, and still
more impressed with the gloomy austerity of Sparta, he set no bounds to
his ambition; he treated his officers, and even the confederate generals, with
severity, arrogance, and disdain, and so much alienat∣ed the minds of the
soldiers, that he was for∣saken by all the confederates, who put
them∣selves under the command and protection of Aristides and Cimon.
These generals had ever preserved a contrary conduct; assable,
courteous, and obliging, they tempered their authority with mildness, and won
by their <PB N="185" REF="188"/> manners such as they could not engage by
their benefits. An opposition so mortifying could not but be
displeasing to Pausanias; it was in vain that he attempted to keep up his
authori∣ty by pride and ostentation, his importance sunk with his
unpopularity, and he became contemptible even to those that still
acknow∣ledged his command.</P>
<P>Perhaps it was from these motives that he resolved to
sacrifice his country to his ambition, and give up to the Persians a
state where he could no longer expect to dictate. Be this as it will, he made
overtures for gaining the favour of Xerxes; and, in order to ingratiate
himself at the court of that monarch, he suf∣fered some of his more
exalted prisoners to make their escape by night, commissioned with
letters to Xerxes, wherein he offered to deliver up Sparta and all Greece, on
condition that he would give him his daughter in marriage. Xerxes readily
harkened to the proposal, and referred him to Artabazus, his governor, to
concert measures with him for putting it in execution. He also furnished
him with a large sum of money to be distributed among such of the Grecian
states as would join in the con∣spiracy.</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="189"/> How long this treaty continued secret we
are not told, but it was discovered at Sparta before it could be put into
execution, and Pau∣sanias was ordered home to take his trial for the offence.
The proofs, however, against him were not sufficient for conviction, as the
Ephori had made it a rule never to convict a man but upon the plainest
evidence. But his command was taken from him, and he retired, still
meditating revenge and the destruction of his country. It was not long,
however, before he received a second summons to appear before the Ephori
for fresh crimes, and a number of his own slaves were found to depose
against him. Still, however, he had the fortune to come off, the mildness
of the Spartan laws, and the authority of his regal office, which he still
possessed, conspiring to protect him.</P>
<P>Pausanias having in this manner twice escap∣ed the justice of
his country, would not, how∣ever, abandon his base projects, or sacrifice
his resentment to his safety. Immediately upon his being acquitted, he
returned to the sea∣coasts, without any authority from the state, and
still continued to carry on his correspondence with Artabazus. He now acted
with such little reserve, that his conduct was known to the Ephori, and
they only wanted information <PB N="187" REF="190"/> to convict him. While they
were thus per∣plexed for want of evidence, a certain slave, who was called
the Argilian, cleared their doubts, and came with proofs which could not be
resisted. This man had been employed by Pausanias to carry a letter to
Artabazus, and he accordingly prepared himself for the expedition, but
reflecting, that many of his fellow-slaves had been sent on similar
messages, and seeing none of them return, he was in∣duced to open the
pacquet of which he was the bearer, and there he discovered the mystery and
his own danger. It seems, that Pausanias and the Persian governor had
agreed to put to death all the messengers they mutually sent to each
other as soon as their letters were deliver∣ed, that there might be no
possibility left of tracing out, or discovering the correspondence.
This letter he delivered to the Ephori, who were now convinced that Pausanias
was guilty, but for a more thorough confirmation, they were willing to have it
from himself. For this purpose, they contrived that the slave should
take sanctuary in the temple of Neptune as for safety and protection, and
under a pretence of supplicating the deity for the infidelity he had
committed. The instant Pausanias was informed of his slave's behaviour,
he hastened <PB N="188" REF="191"/> to the temple to enquire the reason,
where the slave informed him, that having opened his letter, he found the
contents fatal to himself, and therefore took this method of averting the
danger. Pausanias instead of denying the fact, endeavoured rather to pacify
the slave, and promised him a large reward to bribe his future secrecy.
But during this interview, the Ephori had privately posted persons to
overhear the conversation, and they soon divulged his guilt. The moment,
therefore, he was return∣ed to the city, the Ephori resolved to seize him,
and from the aspect of one of these magistrates he plainly perceived his
danger: he, therefore, flew to take sanctuary in the temple of Minerva, and
got thither before his pursuers could overtake him. As the religion of the
state would not permit his being taken forcibly from thence, the people
stopped up the entrance with great stones, and tearing off the roof, left
him exposed to the inclemency of the weather. After a short stay he was
starved to death; and in this miserable manner died the general who had led
on the victorious troops to the field of Plataea.</P>
<P>The fate of Pausanias soon after involved that of
Themistocles, who had some time be∣fore been banished, and lived in great
esteem <PB N="189" REF="192"/> at Argos. A passionate thirst of glory,
and a strong desire to command arbitrarily over the citizens, had made him
very odious at Athens. He had built near his house a temple in ho∣nour of
Diana, under this title, To Diana, the Goddess of Good Counsel, as hinting
his own counsels upon several important occasions, and thus tacitly
reproaching his fellow-citizens of having forgot them. This, though a small
offence, was sufficient to expel him from so sluctuating and jealous a
state as that of Athens; but he was now accused of having participat∣ed in,
and having been privy to the designs of Pausanias. In fact, Pausanias had
communi∣cated to him all his designs, but Themistocles had rejected his
proposals with the utmost in∣dignation. But then he concealed his
enter∣prizes, either thinking it base to betray the secrets trusted to
his confidence, or imagining it impossible for such dangerous and
ill-con∣certed schemes to take effect. Be this as it will, upon the downfall
of Pausanias, it ap∣peared that a correspondence had been carried on
between them, and the Lacedaemonians declared themselves his accusers
before the as∣sembly of the people of Athens. Such of the citizens as had
long either envied, or feared Themistocles, now joined in the general
accu∣sation, <PB N="190" REF="193"/> and urged his death with great acri∣mony.
Aristides alone, who had long been his open opposer, refused to join in
this base confe∣deracy against him, and rejected so mean an op∣portunity
of revenge, being as little inclined to delight in the misfortunes of his
adversary, as he had before been to envy his successes. It was in vain
that Themistocles answered by letters to the calumnies laid against him;
it was in vain that he alledged, that a mind like his disdaining slavery at
home, could think of wishing for it in exile; the people too strongly
wrought upon by his accusers, sent persons to seize and bring him
before the council of Greece. Fortunately, however, he had time∣ly notice of
their design, and went to take re∣fuge in the island of Corcyra, to the
inhabi∣tants of which he had formerly done signal ser∣vices. From thence he
fled to Epirus, and finding himself still pursued by the Athenians, grown
at length desperate, he fled to Admetus king of the Molossians for
refuge. There he first practised all the abject arts of a man oblig∣ed to
sue to a tyrant for succour. He had up∣on a former occasion been
instrumental in pre∣venting the Athenians from granting aid to this monarch,
and this was now severely re∣membered against him. Admetus was from 
<PB N="191" REF="194"/> home at the time Themistocles came to im∣plore
protection; and, upon his return, he was surprised to find his old
adversary who had come to put himself under his protection. As soon as
the king appeared, Themistocles took that monarch's young son in his arms,
and seating himself amidst the houshold gods, in∣formed him of the
cause of his arrival, and im∣plored his clemency and protection. Adme∣tus
surprised, and moved with compassion at seeing the greatest man of
Greece an humble suppliant at his feet, raised him immediately from the
ground, and promised him protection. Accordingly, when the Athenians and
Lace∣daemonians came to demand him, he refused absolutely to deliver up a
person who had made his palace an asylum, in the firm per∣suasion that
it would afford him safety and protection. Thus, continuing to spend the
close of life in indolence and retirement, hav∣ing learned to pardon and
despise the ingrati∣tude his country, he expected at least their
for∣giveness. But the Athenians and Lacedaemo∣nians would not suffer him to
live in peace, and still insisted on having him delivered up. In this
exigence, as the king found himself unable to protect his illustrious
guest, he resolved to promote his escape. He was, <PB N="192" REF="195"/>
therefore, put on board a merchant ship, which was sailing to Ionia, and
his quality concealed with the utmost precaution. A storm having carried
the ship near the island of Naxos, then besieged by the Athenians, the
imminent danger he was in of falling into their hands, compelled him to
discover himself to the pilot, and prevailed upon him to steer for
Asia; where, arriving at Cumae, a city of Aeolia, in Asia Minor, he was
from thence sent under a strong guard, and in one of those covered
chariots in which the Persians were accustomed to convey their wives to the
court at Sardis.</P>
<P>When the unfortunate exile was arrived at the palace of the
voluptuous monarch of the country, he waited on the captain of the guard,
requesting, as a Grecian stranger to have permission to speak with
the king. The officer informed him of a ceremony, which he knew was
insupportable to some Greeks, but without which none were allowed that
honour. This was to fall prostrate before the Persian monarch, and to
worship him as the living image of the gods on earth. Themistocles, who was
never scrupu∣lous of the means of obtaining what he sought, promised to
comply, and falling on his face before the king in the Persian manner,
declared <PB N="193" REF="196"/> his name, his country, and misfortunes. 
<Q REND="inline">"I have done, cried he, my ungrateful country
services more than once, and I am now come to offer these services to
you. My life is in your hands: you may now exert your clemency, or display
your vengeance. By the former you will preserve a faithful suppliant, by
the latter you will destroy the greatest enemy to Greece."</Q> The king
made him no answer at this audience, though he was struck with admiration
at his eloquence and intrepidity, but he soon gave a loose to his joy for
the event. He told his courtiers, that he considered the arrival of
Themistocles as a very happy accident, and wished that his enemies would
for ever pursue the same destructive methods of banishing from among
them all the good and wise. Even his satisfactions were continued in a
dream. At night he was seen to start from his sleep, and three times to
cry out, 
<Q REND="inline">"I have got Themis∣tocles the Athenian."</Q> He
even gave him three cities for his support, and had him maintained in the
utmost affluence and splendor. It is said that such was his favour at
the Persian court, and so great was the consideration in which he was
held by all ranks of mankind, that one day at table he was heard to cry out to
his w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fe and children that were
placed there, 
<Q REND="inline">"Chil∣dren, <PB N="194" REF="197"/> we should have
been certainly ruined, if we had not been formerly undone."</Q></P>
<P>In this manner he lived in affluence and con∣tented slavery, until
the king began to think of employing his talents in sending him at the head
of an army against Athens. Athough Themistocles professed himself an
open enemy to that state, yet he still harboured a latent af∣fection for
it, which no resentment could re∣move. The consciousness that he
should be instrumental in overturning a city which had been made to
flourish by his counsels, gave him inexpressible pain. He found
himself at last unable to sustain the conflict between his gratitude to
the king and his love to his coun∣try; and, therefore, resolved upon dying as
the only means of escaping from his perplexity. He, therefore, prepared a
solemn sacrifice, to which he invited all his friends, when, after
embracing them all, and taking a last farewell, he swallowed poison,
which soon put an end to his life. He died at Magnesia, aged three∣score
and five years, the greatest part of which he had spent in the intrigues
and bustles of active employment. Themistocles seemed to unite in
himself all the prominent features of the Greek character; sagacious,
eloquent, and brave, yet unprincipled, artful, and merce∣nary, 
<PB N="195" REF="198"/> with too many virtues ever to be men∣tioned as a
despicable character, and too many defects ever to be considered as a great
one.</P>
<P>In the mean time, while Themistocles was thus become the sport
of fortune, the just Aris∣tides attempted a nobler path to glory. It has
already been observed, that the command of Greece had passed from Sparta
to the Atheni∣ans; and it was agreed among the body of the states, that their
common treasure for car∣rying on the expences of the war, should be lodged
in the island of Delos, under the cus∣tody of a man of a clear head and an
uncor∣rupt heart. The great question, therefore, was where to find a man to
be trusted with so im∣portant a charge, and steadfastly known to
pre∣fer the public interest to his own. In this ge∣neral disquisition all
parties at last cast their eyes on Aristides, of whom Themistocles
used jestingly to say, that he had no other merit than that of a strong
box, in keeping safely what was committed to his charge.</P>
<P>The conduct of Aristides in his discharge of this duty, only
served to confirm the great opi∣nion mankind had formed of his integrity. He
presided over the treasury with the care of a father over his family, and
the caution of a miser over what he holds dearer than himself. 
<PB N="196" REF="199"/> No man complained of his administration, and no part
of the public money was exhausted in vain. He who thus contributed to make
go∣vernment rich, was himself very poor; and so far was he from being
ashamed of poverty, that he considered it as glorious to him as all the
trophies and victories he had won. It hap∣pened upon a certain occasion, that
Callias, an intimate friend and relation of Aristides, was summoned before
the judges for some of∣fence, and one of the chief objections alledg∣ed
against him, was that while he rolled in af∣fluence and luxury, he suffered
his friend and relation Aristides to remain in poverty and want. Upon this
occasion, Aristides was call∣ed upon, when it appeared that Callias had
often offered to share his fortune with him, but that he declined the
benefit; asserting, that he only might be said to want who permitted his
appetites to transgress the bounds of his in∣come, and that he who could
dispense with a few things, thus rendered himself more like the gods,
that want for nothing.</P>
<P>In this manner he lived, just in his public, and independent in
his private capacity. His house was a public school for virtue, and was
open to all young Athenians who sought wis∣dom, or were ambitious of power.
He gave <PB N="197" REF="200"/> them the kindest reception, heard them with
patience, instructed them with familiarity, and endeavoured above all things
to give them a just value for themselves. Among the rest of his
disciples Cimon, who afterwards made such a distinguished figure in the
state, was one of the foremost.</P>
<P>History does not mention the exact time or place of his death, but
it pays the most glori∣ous testimony to his disinterested character, in
telling us, that he who had the absolute dis∣posal of all the public
treasures died poor. It is even asserted, that he did not leave money
enough behind him to pay the expences of his funeral, but that the government
was obliged to bear the charge of it, and to maintain his family. His daughters
were married, and his son subsisted at the expence of the public, and
some of his grandchildren were subsisted by a pension equal to that
which such received as had been victorious at the Olympic games. But the
greatest honour which his countrymen paid to his memory, was in giving him
the title of Just, a character far superior to all the empty titles of
wisdom or conquest, since fortune or accident may confer wisdom or
valour, but all the virtues of morality are solely of our own making.</P>
<P><PB N="198" REF="201"/> Athens being in this manner deprived of the
counsels and integrity of her two greatest ma∣gistrates, room was now
made for younger ambition to step forward, and Cimon, the son of Miltiades,
promised to fill the scene with dignity and honour Cimon had spent his
youth in excesses, from whence it was thought no effort could extricate
him. When he first offered to gain public favour, he was so ill re∣ceived
by the people, prejudiced against him by his former follies, that he
suffered the most cruel neglect. But, though he was possessed of
courage and abilities, he began to lay aside all thoughts of the public,
contented with on∣ly humbler satisfactions. But Aristides per∣ceiving that
his dissolute turn of mind was united with many great qualifications, he
in∣spired him with fresh hopes, and persuaded him once more to renew the
onset He now, there∣fore, entirely changed his conduct, and laying aside
his juvenile follies, aimed at nothing but what was great and noble. Thus, he
became not inferior to Miltiades in courage, to The∣mistocles in prudence,
and was not far surpass∣ed by Aristides in integrity.</P>
<P>The first expedition of any note to the com∣mand of which Cimon
was appointed, was of the fleet destined to scour the Asiatic seas. 
<PB N="199" REF="202"/> When he was arrived at Caria, all the Grecian cities
upon the sea-coast immediately came in, and the rest, which were
garrisoned by the Per∣sians, were taken by storm. Thus, by his conduct as
well as by his intelligence, the whole country from Ionia to Pamphylia
declar∣ed against the power of Persia, and joined in the association
with Greece.</P>
<P>The capture of the city Eion is too remark∣able to be past over in
silence. Boges was go∣vernor, who held it for his master, the king of
Persia, with a firm resolution to save it, or perish in its fall. It
was in his power to have capitulated with the besiegers, and Cimon had often
offered him very advantageous terms, but preferring his honour to his safety,
he de∣clined all treaty, and defended his station with incredible fury, till
he found it no longer pos∣sible to continue his defence. Being at last in
the utmost want of provisions, he threw all his treasures from the walls
into the river Strymon, after which, killing his wife and children, he laid
them upon a pile which he had erected for that purpose, and then setting
fire to the whole, rushed and expired in the midst of the flames.</P>
<P>Cimon thus proceeding from one conquest to another, was at last
informed that the whole Persian fleet was anchored at the mouth of the 
<PB N="200" REF="203"/> river Eurymedon, where they expected a rein∣forcement of
ships from Phoenicia, and, there∣fore, deferred an engagement till then. The
Athenian general, however, resolved, if possi∣ble, to prevent this
junction, and ranged his gallies in such a posture as to prevent, it and
yet compel the enemy to an engage∣ment. It was in vain that the Persian fleet
re∣tired farther up the mouth of the river, the Athenians still pursued
them up the stream, until they were obliged to prepare for battle. The
Persians having the superiority of an hun∣dred sail, maintained the
conflict for some time with great intrepidity, but being at last forced on
shore, they who came first threw themselves upon land, leaving their
empty vessels to the enemy. Thus, besides what were sunk, the Athenians
took above two hundred ships, and following their blow upon land, the Greek
soldiers jumping from their ships, and setting up a shout, ran
furiously upon the enemy, who sustained the first shock with great
resolution. But, at length, the Grecian valour surmounted the enemy's
des∣peration; a total rout of the Persians ensued, numbers were made
prisoners, and a great quan∣tity of plunder seized, which was found in
their tents. Thus, the Greeks, obtained a <PB N="201" REF="204"/> double victory
by sea and land upon the same occasion.</P>
<P>Cimon having returned successful from this expedition,
resolved to expend those treasures which he had taken in war, in
beautifying and adorning his native city. A taste for architec∣ture had for
some time been entering into Greece, and the Athenians gave the world
examples in this art, that surpass all others to this very day. Victories
so very humiliating to the pride of Persia, induced that empire at last
to think of peace, and after some time a treaty was concluded, in which the
terms were very honourable on the side of Greece. It was stipulated, that
the Grecian cities in Asia should be left in quiet enjoyment of their
liberty, and that both the land and sea forces of the Per∣sians should be
kept at such a distance from the Grecian seas, as not to create the
smallest suspicion. Thus entirely ended the Persian war, which had
kept the Grecian states united, and called all their abilities into exertion;
from that time forward those enmities which were dissipated upon the
common foe, began to be turned upon each other; they lost all warlike
spirit in petty jealousies, and entirely softening by the refinements and
luxuries of peace, prepared <PB N="202" REF="205" MS="y"/> themselves for
submission to the first invader of their freedom.</P>
<P>About this time the study of philosophy was carried from Ionia
to Athens by Athena∣goras the Clazomenian. Poetry was, at the same time,
cultivated by Simonides of the island of Ceos, who sung the exploits of his
country in a style becoming their valour. His writings however have not had
merit enough to preserve them from oblivion; and, it may be asserted,
that mankind never suffer any work to be lost which tends to make them more
wise or happy.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. From the Peace with PERSIA to the Peace of
NICIAS.</HEAD>
<P>THE state of Athens being thus in a great measure freed from its
fears of a foreign ene∣my, began to cherish intestine animosities, and
its citizens laboured with every art to supplant each other in aiming at
places of trust and au∣thority. Besides Cimon, who, by general consent,
had been appointed to conduct the <PB N="203" REF="206"/> fleet and army, others
endeavoured to take the lead at home, and to govern with less hazard the
operations of the state. The fore∣most in this attempt was Pericles, who
was much younger than Cimon, and of a quite different character. Pericles was
descended from the greatest and most illustrious families of Athens:
his father, Xanthippus, defeated the Persians at Mycale, and his mother
Aga∣rista, was niece to Calisthenes, who expelled the tyrants, and
established a popular govern∣ment in Athens. He had early thoughts of
ris∣ing in the state, and took lessons from Anaxa∣goras, in the
philosophy of nature. He studi∣ed politics with great assiduity, but
particular∣ly devoted himself to eloquence, which, in a popular slate, he
considered as the fountain of all promotion. His studies were crowned with
success; the poets, his cotemporaries, affirm, that his eloquence was so
powerful, that, like thunder, he shook and astonished all Greece. He had
the art of uniting force and beauty; there was no resisting the strength
of his argu∣ments, or the sweetness of his delivery. Thucy∣dides, his great
opponent, was often heard to say, that though he had often overthrown him,
the power of his persuasion was such, that the audience could never
perceive him fallen.</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="207"/> To this eloquence he added also a thorough
insight into human nature, as well as a perfect acquaintance with the
disposition of his audi∣tors. It was a constant saying with him to
himself, Remember Pericles thou art going to speak to men born in the arms
of liberty, and still took care to flatter them in their ruling pas∣sion.
He resembled the tyrant Pisistratus, not only in the sweetness of his
voice, but the fea∣tures of his face, and his whole air and man∣ner. To these
natural and acquired graces, he added those of fortune; he was very rich, and
had an extensive alliance with all the most powerful families of the
state.</P>
<P>The death of Aristides, the banishment of Themistocles, and
the absence of Cimon, gave opportunities to his growing ambition. Yet he at
first concealed his designs with the most cautious reserve, till
finding the people grow∣ing more and more in his interest, he set
him∣self at their head, and opposed the principal men of the state with
great appearance of dis∣interelled virtue. The chief obstacle to his rise
was Cimon, whose candour and liberality had gained him a numerous party of
all ranks and denominations. In opposition to him, Pe∣ricles called in
popular assistance, and by ex∣pencing the public money in bribes,
largesses, <PB N="205" REF="208"/> and other distributions, he easily
gained the multitude to espouse his interests.</P>
<P>Thus, having laid a secure foundation in popularity, he next
struck at the council of the Areopagus, composed of the most
respect∣able persons of all Athens; and, by the assist∣ance of one
Ephialtes, another popular cham∣pion, he drew away most causes from the
cog∣nizance of that court, and brought the whole order into contempt. In this
manner, while Cimon was permitted to conduct the war abroad, he managed all the
supplies at home; and, as it was his interest to keep Cimon at a
distance, he took care to provide him with a sufficiency of foreign
employment.</P>
<P>In this state of parties at Athens, an infur∣rection of the
Helotae, or Lacedaemonian slaves, gave an opportunity of trying the
strength of either. These men, who had for several cen∣turies groaned
under the yoke of their country∣men, and had been excluded from all hopes of
rising, merely by the influence of an unjust precedent to their prejudice,
at last took up arms against their masters, and threatened no less than
the destruction of the Spartan state. In this extremity the Lacedaemonians
sent to Athens to implore succours; but this was op∣posed by Fphialtes,
who declared, that it <PB N="206" REF="209"/> would be no way adviseable to
assist them, or to make a rival city powerful by their assistance.
On the other hand, Cimon espoused the cause of Sparta, declaring, that it
was weak and in∣consistent to maim the Grecian confederacy, by suffering
one of its members to be tamely lopped away. His opinion for this time
pre∣vailed; he was permitted to march forth at the head of a numerous body to
their relief, and the insurrection was quelled at their approach. But
shortly after the mischief broke out afresh. The Helots possessed
themselves of the strong fortress of Ithome, and the Spartans again
pe∣titioned for Athenian assistance. It was now that the party of
Pericles was found to prevail, and the Lacedaemonians were refused a
com∣pliance with their demands. Thus left to fi∣nish the war with their
insurgent slaves in the best manner they could, after besieging Ithome,
which held out for ten years, they at last be∣came masters of it, sparing
the lives of those who defended it, upon condition of leaving Peloponnesus
ever after.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the refusal on the side of Athens, and some
indignities said to be receiv∣ed on the side of Lacedaemon, revived a
jeal∣ousy that had long subsisted between these rival states, which
continued thence forward <PB N="207" REF="210"/> to operate with greater or
diminished influ∣ence, until both were utterly unabled to with∣stand the
smallest efforts of foreign invasion.</P>
<P>The first instance the Athenians gave of their resentment, was
to banish Cimon, who had been a favourer of the Spartan cause, for ten
years, from the city. They next dissolved their alliance with Sparta, and
entered into a treaty with the Argives, the professed enemies of the
former. The slaves of Ithome were also taken under Athenian protection, and
settled with their families at Naupactus. But what contributed to widen the
breach still more, the city of Megara revolting from its alliance with
Sparta, was protected and garrisoned by the Athenians; thus was laid the
foundation of an inveterate hatred, which ended in mutual destruction.</P>
<P>As, in all beginning enmities, several trea∣ties were entered
into, and several leagues concluded on both sides, till at last they came
to a formal rupture. Two pitched battles be∣tween the Athenians and
Corinthians, in which either side was alternatively victorious, sound∣ed
the alarm. Another followed between the Athenians and Spartans at Tangara, in
which, Cimon forgetting the injury he had sustained from his country, came
in to its assistance; but <PB N="208" REF="211"/> the Athenians suffered
a defeat. A month or two after repaired the disgrace, and the Athe∣nians were
in their turn victorious. The con∣duct of Cimon again restored him to public
favour; he was recalled from banishment, in which he had spent five years;
and it was Pericles, his rival, who first proposed the decree.</P>
<P>The first use Cimon made of his return, was to reconcile the two
rival states to each other; and this was so far affected outwardly, that a
truce for five years was concluded between them. This led the way to exerting
the power of the state upon a more distant enemy. By his advice, a fleet of
two hundred sail was manned, and destined, under his command, to conquer
the island of Cyprus. He quickly sailed, over-ran the island, and laid
siege to Citium. Here, being either wounded by the defendants, or wasted by
sickness, he began to perceive the approaches of dissolution; but
still mindful of his duty, he ordered his attendants to conceal his death
until their schemes were crowned with success. They obeyed with
se∣crecy and success. Thirty days after he was dead, the army, which
still supposed itself un∣der his command, gained a signal victory;
thus he died not only in the arms of conquest, but <PB N="209" REF="212"/>
gained battles merely by the efficacy of his name. With Cimon, in a great
measure, ex∣pired the spirit of glory in Athens. As he was the last, so
he was the most successful of the Grecian heroes. Such was the terror of
the Persians at his name, that they univer∣sally deserted the
sea-coasts, and would not come within four hundred furlongs of the place
where he could be possibly expected.</P>
<P>Pericles being now, by the death of Cimon, freed from a potent
rival, set himself to complete the work of ambition which he had begun, and
by dividing the conquered lands, amusing the people with shows, and
adorning the city with public buildings, he gained such an ascendant over
the minds of the people, that he might be said to have attained a
mo∣narchical power in Athens. He found means to maintain for eight months in
the year a great number of poor citizens, by putting them on board the fleet,
consisting of threescore ships, which he fitted out every year. He
planted several colonies in the many places which had lately submitted to
Athens. By this he clear∣ed the city of a great number of idle persons, who
were ever ready to disturb government; and were, at the same time, unable
to subsist. But the public buildings which he raised, the 
<PB N="210" REF="213"/> ruins of some of which subsist to this day, are
sufficient to endear his name to posterity. It is surprising, that in a
city not noted for the number of its inhabitants, and in so short a space
of time as that of his administration, such laborious, expensive, and
magnificent works could be performed. All the arts of architec∣ture,
sculpture, and painting were exhausted in his designs; and what still
remain, continue to this hour as inimitable models of perfection. To effect
these great works, he, in some mea∣sure, had recourse to injustice,
and availed himself of those treasures which had been sup∣plied by
Greece for carrying on the war with Persia, and which having been lodged at
De∣los, he had address enough to get transported to Athens, where he
expended them in securing his own power by all the arts of popularity. By
these means Athens became so much ad∣mired, and envied by her neighbours,
that it went by the name of the <HI>Ornament;</HI> and when it was urged, that
the common treasure was squandred away in these works of show,
Peri∣cles answered, that the people of Athens were not accountable to any for
their conduct; for they had the best right to the treasures of the
confederated states who took the greatest care to defend them. He added,
that it was fit <PB N="211" REF="214"/> ingenious artizans should have their
share of the public money, since there was still enough left for carrying
on the war.</P>
<P>These were rather the arguments of power than persuasion, of a
man already in possession than willing upon just grounds to
relinquish what he claimed. It was seen not only by the wiser citizens,
but by all the states of Greece, that he was daily striding into power, and
would, as Pisistratus had done be∣fore, make the people the fabricators of
their own chains. For remedying this growing evil, the heads of the city
opposed Thucy∣dides to his growing power, and attempted to restrain his
career by opposing eloquence to popularity.</P>
<P>Thucydides was brother-in-law to Cimon, and had displayed his
wisdom on numberless occasions. He was not possessed of the
mili∣tary talents of his rival; but his eloquence gave him a very powerful
influence over the people. As he never left the city, he still com∣bated
Pericles in all his measures, and for a while brought down the ambition of
his rival to the standard of reason.</P>
<P>But his efforts could not long avail against the persuasive
power and corrupt influence of his opponent. Pericles every day gained new 
<PB N="212" REF="215"/> ground, till he at last found himself
possessed of the whole authority of the state. It was then that he
began to change his behaviour, and from acting the fawning and humble
sup∣pliant, he assumed the haughty airs of royalty. He now no longer
submitted himself to the ca∣price of the people, but changed the
demo∣cratic state of Athens into a kind of monarchy, without departing
however from the public good. He would sometimes indeed win his
fellow-citizens over to his will, but at other times, when he found them
obstinate, he would in a manner compel them to consult their own
interests. Thus, between power and persua∣sion, public profusion, and
private oeconomy, political falsehood, and private integrity, Pe∣ricles
became the principal ruler at Athens, and all such as were his enemies,
became the ene∣mies of the state.</P>
<P>It is not to be wondered, that this prospe∣rous and magnificent
state of Athens was not a little displeasing to the rival states of
Greece, especially as its state of splendor was, in some measure,
formed from their contributions. The Spartans particularly still continued to
re∣gard this growing city with envy, and soon shewed their displeasure,
by refusing to send deputies to Athens to consult about repairing 
<PB N="213" REF="216"/> the temple that had been burnt down during the wars with
Persia. The successes of Peri∣cles against the enemy in Thrace,
still more encreased their uneasiness; and particularly when sailing
round Peloponnesus with an hun∣dred ships, he protected the allies of
Greece, and granted their cities all they thought fit to ask him. These
successes raised the in∣dignation of Sparta, while they intoxicated
Athens with ideas of ambition, and opened new inlets for meditating conquest.
The ci∣tizens now began to talk of attempts upon Egypt, of attacking the
maritime provinces of Persia, of carrying their arms into Sicily, and of
extending their conquests from Italy to Car∣thage. These were views beyond
their power, and that rather marked their pride than their ability.</P>
<P>An expedition against Samos, in favour of the Miletians, who had
craved their assistance, was the beginning of this rupture, which never
after was closed up. It is pretended, that Pericles fomented this war, to
please a famous courtezan named Aspasia, of whom he was particularly
enamoured. After several events and battles, not worth the regard of
history, Pericles besieged the capital of Samos with tortoises and
battering rams, which was the <PB N="214" REF="217"/> first time these
military engines had been em∣ployed in sieges. The Samians, after
sustain∣ing a nine months siege, surrendered. Peri∣cles rased their
walls, dispossessed them of their ships, and demanded immense
sums to defray the expences of the war. Flushed with this success, he
returned to Athens, buried all those who had lost their lives in the
siege in the most splendid manner, and pronounced their funeral
oration.</P>
<P>A rupture now between the Athenians and Lacedaemonians seemed
inevitable. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. M. 3572.</NOTE> Pericles, therefore, to
anticipate the designs of his rival state, advised that aid should be
sent to the people of Corcyra, whom the Corinthians, assisted by the
Lacedaemonians, had invaded.</P>
<P>As the quarrel between the Corcyreans and Corinthians gave rise to
the great Peloponnesi∣an war, which soon after involved all Greece, it will
be necessary to give a slight account of its original. Epidamnus was a
colony of the Corcyreans, which growing first rich, and soon after
factious, banished the chief of her citi∣zens. The exiles joining with the
Illyrians, brought the Epidamnians so low, that they were obliged to send
to Corcyra, their parent city, for assistance. The Corcyreans rejecting
their request, they had recourse to Corinth; <PB N="215" REF="218"/> and
giving themselves up to that state, were taken under its protection. This,
however, the Corcyreans began to resent, and having been remiss in
affording assistance themselves, re∣solved to punish such as
should offer any. A rupture ensued between the Corinthians and Corcyreans,
some naval engagements ensued, in which the Corcyreans being worsted, had
recourse, as has been already observed, to the Athenians for support, who
sent some naval suc∣cours, which, however, proved of no great ef∣ficacy
in their desence.</P>
<P>From this war arose another; for Potidaea, a city belonging to
Athens, declaring for Co∣rinth, these two states, from being
accessaries, became principals, and drew their forces into the field near
Potidaea, where a battle ensued, in which the Athenians had the victory. It
was in this battle that Socrates saved the life of Alcibiades, his pupil; and
after the battle was over, procured him the prize of valour which he himself
had more justly earned. The city of Potidaea was soon after besieged in
con∣sequence of this victory, and the Corinthians complained to the states
of Greece against the Athenians as having infringed the articles of peace.
The Lacedaemonians, in particular, admitted them to an audience, where the 
<PB N="216" REF="219"/> deputies of Corinth endeavoured to rouse them into a
sense of their danger from the ambitious designs of Athens; and
threatened, if left unprotected, to put themselves under the command of a
power strong enough to grant them protection and safety. After hear∣ing
what the Athenians had to reply, the Spartans came to a close debate among
them∣selves, wherein it was universally agreed, that the Athenians were the
aggressors, and that they should be reduced to a just sense of
their duty. But the dispute was, whether war should be immediately declared
against them, or remonstrances made to bring them to rea∣son. Archidamus,
one of their kings, a man of prudence and temper, was of opinion, that they
were not at this time a match for Athens, and endeavoured to dissuade them
from rush∣ing into a thoughtless and improvident war. But Sthenelaides, one
of the Ephori, urged the contrary, alledging, that when once they had received
an injury, they ought not to de∣liberate, but that revenge should follow
in∣sult. Accordingly a war was declared, and all the confederates were made
acquainted with the resolution.</P>
<P>War being thus resolved upon, in order to give a colour of
justice to their designs, the <PB N="217" REF="220"/> Lacedaemonians began
by sending ambassa∣dors to Athens; and while they made prepara∣tions for
acting with vigour, still kept up a shew of seeking redress by treaty.
They re∣quired of the Athenians the expulsion of some who had prophaned the
temple of Minerva at Cylon from their city; they demanded that the siege of
Potidaea should be raised, and that the Athenians should cease to
infringe upon the liberties of Greece.</P>
<P>Pericles now saw that as he had led the Athenians into a war, it
was incumbent upon him to inspire them with courage to prosecute it with
success. He shewed his countrymen that even trifles extorted from them
with an air of command, were in themselves a sufficient ground for war:
that they might promise them∣selves a considerable share of success
from the division in the confederated councils of their opponents: that they
had shipping to in∣vade their enemies coasts, and their city being well
fortified, could not easily be taken by land. He concluded with telling them
the absolute necessity there was for war; and that the more chearfully
they undertook it, the easier it would come to an happy conclusion. That
the greatest honours had generally recurred to their state from the
greatest extremities; <PB N="218" REF="221"/> that this might serve to
animate them in its de∣fence, so as to transmit it with undiminished
honour to posterity. The people, giddy, fond of change, and unterrified by
distant dangers, readily came into his opinion; and, to give some colour to
their proceedings, sent evasive an∣swers to the Spartan demand, and
concluded with asserting, that they desired to adjust all differences
by treaty, as being unwilling to begin a war; but, in case of danger, would
defend themselves with desperate resolution.</P>
<P>Thus the people, from their love of change, entered hastily into
the war, but Pericles was personally interested in its declaration. He was
deeply indebted to the state, and knew that a time of peace was the only
opportunity in which he could be called upon to settle his accounts. It is
said that Alcibiades, his ne∣phew, seeing him one day very pensive, and
demanding the reason, was answered, that he was considering how to make
up his accounts. 
<Q REND="inline">"You had better, said he, consider how to avoid
being accountable."</Q> Besides this, Pericles find∣ing no happiness in
domestic society, gave himself up to the allurements of his mistress
Aspasia, whose wit and vivacity had captivat∣ed all the poets and
philosophers of the age, even Socrates himself not excepted. She was 
<PB N="219" REF="222"/> inclined to oppose the Spartan state; and he, in
some measure, is thought to acquiesce in her advice.</P>
<P>War being thus resolved on every side, the first dawn of
success seemed to offer in favour of Athens; the city of Platea, that had
lately declared for them, was surprised by three hundred Thebans, who were
let in by a party of the town that joined in the conspiracy. But a part of
the citizens that had espoused the opposite interests, falling upon
them in the night, killed a part, and took two hun∣dred prisoners, who a
little time after were put to death. The Athenians, as soon as the news was
brought of this action, sent succours and provisions thither, and cleared
the city of all persons who were incapable of bearing arms. From this time
all Greece appeared in motion, every part of it took a side in the common
quar∣rel, except a few states who continued neuter till they should see
the event of the war. The majority were for the Lacedaemonians, as be∣ing the
deliverers of Greece, and espoused their interests with ardour. On their
side were rang∣ed the Achaians, the inhabitants of Pellene excepted, the
people Megara, Locris, Boeotia, Phocis, Ambracia, Leucadia, and Anactorium. On
the side of Athens, were the people of <PB N="220" REF="223"/> Chios,
Lesbos, Platea, many of the islands, and several tributary maritime
states, includ∣ing those of Thrace, Potidaea excepted.</P>
<P>The Lacedaemonians immediately after their attempt upon Platea
assembled a body of men, making up with their confederates sixty
thousand in number: Archidamus, who commanded the army, harrangued them in an
animated speech. He told them, that the eyes of all Greece were upon them;
that they were supe∣rior in numbers, and were to oppose an enemy not only
inferior in number, but oppressed with the consciousness of their own
violence and injustice. He exhorted them to march boldly into the country
they were about to enter, with that courage for which they had been long
famous, and that caution which was requisite against so insidious an
ad∣versary. The whole army answered with an acclamation of joy; and thus,
that war which was to be the destruction of Greece, was com∣menced in a
phrensy of transport by its short∣sighted inhabitants, who hurried on
to mutual ruin.</P>
<P>Pericles, on the other hand, prepared his scanty body of Athenians
to meet the threa∣tened blow. He declared to the Athenians, that should
Archidamus, when he was laying <PB N="221" REF="224"/> waste the Athenian
territories, spare any part of those lands that belonged to Pericles
him∣self, he would only consider it as a trick to impose upon Athenian
credulity; he, there∣fore, gave up all his property in those lands, and
resigned them back to the state, from which his ancestors had originally
received them. He remonstrated to the people, that it was their interest to
contract the war, and to let the enemy consume themselves by delay. He
advised them to remove all their effects from their country, and to shut
themselves up in Athens, without ever hazarding a battle. Their troops indeed
were but very scanty com∣pared to those they were to oppose; they
amounted but to thirteen thousand heavy arm∣ed soldiers, sixteen
thousand inhabitants, and twelve hundred horse, with a body of archers
about double that number. This was the whole army of the Athenians, but their
chief strength consisted in a fleet of three hundred gallies, which, by
continually infesting and plundering the enemies coast, raised
contribu∣tions sufficient to defray the expences of the war.</P>
<P>Imprest with the exhortation of Pericles, the Athenians, with a
mixture of grief and resolu∣tion, forsook the culture of their fields, and 
<PB N="222" REF="225"/> carried all their possessions that could be
con∣veyed away with them into Athens. They had now enjoyed the sweets of
peace for near fifty years, and their lands wore an appearance of wealth and
industry; but from the fate of war they were once more obliged to forsake
culture for encampment, the sweets of rural life for their shocks of
battle.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the Lacedaemonians en∣tered the country at Oenoe,
a frontier fortress, and leaving it behind them, marched forward to Acharne,
an unwalled town, within seven miles of Athens. The Athenians, terrified at
their ap∣proach, now began to convert their fury against the enemy into
reproaches against their former leader. They abused him for bringing them
into a war, in which he had not strength to oppose, nor courage to protect;
they loudly desired, notwith∣standing the inferiority of their number, to
be led into the field of battle. Pericles, however, chose the more moderate
part. He shut up the city gates, placed sufficient guards at all the
posts around, sent out parties of horse to keep the enemy employed; and,
at the same time, ordered out one hundred gallies to infest the coasts of
Peloponnesus. These pre∣cautions at last succeeded; after the
Lacedae∣monians had laid waste the whole country <PB N="223" REF="226"/> round
Athens, and insulted the defenders of the city by their numbers and their
reproaches, finding the place impregnable, they abandon∣ed the siege, and the
inhabitants once more issued from their walls in joy and security.</P>
<P>The Athenians after this severe mortifica∣tion, resolved to
retaliate: being left at liberty to act ossensively, as well by land as
sea, they invaded the enemies territory with their whole force in turn, and
took Nisae, a strong haven, with walls reaching unto the city of
Nigara.</P>
<P>Proud of the first dawn of success, the first campaign being
elapsed, during the winter they expressed their triumph by public games
at the funerals of those that were slain in battle. They placed their
bodies in tents three days before the funeral; upon the fourth day cof∣fins of
cyprus was sent from the tribes to con∣vey the bones of their relations; the
proces∣sion marched with solemn pomp, attended by the inhabitants and
strangers who visited the city; their relations and children of the
soldiers who were killed, stood weeping at the sepul∣chre; those who
fell at the battle of Mara∣thon indeed were buried on the field, but the rest
received one common interment in a place called Cerannicus. Pericles, who had
contri∣buted <PB N="224" REF="227"/> to the saving of his country,
contribut∣ed also to its honour, and pronounced a fune∣ral oration over them,
which remains to this day, at once a mark of his eloquence and his gratitude.
But the joy of the public was not confined to empty praises, ceremonies, and
tears; a stipend was set apart for maintaining the widows and the orphans
of those who fell in the service of their country. And thus end∣ed the
first year of the Peloponnesian war.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the ensuing summer, the Lacedaemonians
renewed their hostilities, and invaded the territories of Athens with the
same number of men as before. In this man∣ner these capricious states
went on to harrass and depopulate each other: but a more terri∣ble
punishment now began to threaten them from nature. A plague broke out in the
city of Athens, a more terrible than which is scarcely recorded in the annals
of history. It is related, that it began in Ethiopia, whence it descended
into Egypt, from thence travelled into Libya and Persia, and at last broke
like a flood upon Athens. This pestilence baffled the utmost efforts of
art, the most robust con∣stitutions were unable to withstand its
attacks, no skill could obviate, nor no remedy dispel the terrible
infection. The instant a person was <PB N="225" REF="228"/> seized, he was
struck with despair, which quite disabled him from attempting a cure. The
humanity of friends was fatal to themselves, as it was ineffectual to the
unhappy sufferers. The prodigious quantity of baggage which had been removed
out of their country into their city increased the calamity. Most of the
inhabitants, for want of lodging, lived in little cottages, in which they could
scarce breathe, while the burning heat of the summer increased the
pestilential malignity. They were seen confusedly huddled together, the
dead as well as the dying, some crawling through the streets, some lying
along by the sides of fountains, whither they had endeavour∣ed to repair to
quench the raging thirst which consumed them. Their very temples were
filled with dead bodies, and every part of the city exhibited a dreadful image
of death, without the least remedy for the present, or the least hopes
with regard to futurity. It seized all with such violence, that they fell
one upon another as they passed along the streets. It was also attended
with such uncommon pesti∣lential vapours, that the very beasts and birds
of prey, though famishing round the walls of the city, would not touch the
bodies of those <PB N="226" REF="229"/> who died of it. Even in those who
recovered, it left such a tincture of its malignity, that it struck upon
their senses. It effected the no∣tices and memory of all the passages
of their lives, and they knew neither themselves nor their nearest
relations. The circumstances of this disease are described at large by
Thucy∣dides, who was sick of it himself; and he ob∣serves, among other
effects of it, that it intro∣duced into the city a more licentious way of
living. For the people at first had recourse to their gods to avert that
judgment; but find∣ing they were all alike infected, whether they worshipped
them or not, and that it was ge∣nerally mortal, they abandoned themselves at
once to despair and riot: for since they held their lives but as it were by
the day, the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> were resolved to
make the most of their tim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and
money. The cause of it was generall<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> imputed to Pericles, who, by drawing suc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> numbers into the city, was thought to hav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> corrupted the very air. Yet, though
this w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> raging within, and the
enemy wasting t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> country without,
he was still in the same mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> as
before, that they ought not to put all th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> hopes upon the issue of a battle. In the me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> time, the enemy advancing towards the
co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> <PB N="227" REF="230"/> laid
waste the whole country, and returned, af∣ter having insulted the wretched
Athenians, al∣ready thinned by pestilence and famine.</P>
<P>Fickleness and inconstancy were the pre∣vailing characters of
the Athenians, and as these carried them on a sudden to their greatest
excesses, they soon brought them back within the bounds of moderation and
respect. Peri∣cles had been long a favourite; the calamities of the state
at last began to render him obnoxi∣ous; they had deposed him from the
command of his army, but now repented their rashness; and reinstated him
a short time after, with more than former authority. By dint of suf∣fering,
they began to bear patiently their do∣mestic misfortunes, and, imprest with
a love for their country, asked pardon for their for∣mer ingratitude. But he
did not live long to enjoy his honours. He was seized with the plague, which,
like a malignant enemy, struck its severest blow at parting. Being
extremely ill and ready to breathe his last, the principal citizens, and
such of his friends that had not forsaken him, discoursing in his
bed-chamber concerning the loss they were about to sustain, ran over his
exploits, and computed the num∣ber of his victories. They did not imagine that
Pericles attended to what they said, as he <PB N="228" REF="231"/> seemed
insensible; but it was far otherwise, for not a single word of their
discourse had escap∣ed him. At last, cried he, why will you extol a
series of actions, in which fortune had the greatest part; there is one
circumstance which I would not have forgotten, yet which you have passed
over; I could wish to have it re∣membered, as the most glorious
circumstance of my life,—that I never yet caused a single citizen
to put on mourning.</P>
<P>Thus died Pericles, in whom were united a number of excellent
qualities without imparing each other. As well skilled in naval affairs as in
the conduct of armies; as well skilled in the arts of raising money as of
employing it; eloquent in public, and pleasing in private; he was a patron of
artists, at once informing them by his taste and example.</P>
<P>The most memorable transaction of the fol∣lowing years, was the
siege of Platea by the Lacedaemonians. This was one of the most famous
sieges in antiquity, on account of the vigorous efforts of both parties, but
especially for the glorious resistance made by the besieged, and the
stratagems to escape the fury of the assailants.</P>
<P>The Lacedaemonians besieged this place in the beginning of the
third campaign. As soon as <PB N="229" REF="232"/> they had fixed their camp
round the city, in order to lay waste the places adjacent, the Plataeans
sent deputies to the Lacedaemonian general, declaring the injustice of
injuring them, who had received their liberties on a former occasion from the
Lacedaemonians themselves. The Lacedaemonians replied, that there was but one
method to insure their safety, which was to renew that alliance by which
they had originally procured their freedom; to disclaim their Athenian
supporters, and to unite with the Lacedaemonians, who had power and will to
protect them. The deputies replied, they could not possibly come to any
agreement without first sending to Athens, whither their wives and children
were retired. The Lacedaemonians permitted them to send thither, and the
Athenians solemnly promising to succour them to the utmost of their
power, the Plataeans resolved to suffer the last extremi∣ties rather than
surrender, and prepared for a vigorous defence, with a steady resolution
to succeed or fall.</P>
<P>Archidamus, the Lacedaemonian general, after calling upon the gods
to witness that he did not first infringe the alliance, prepared for the
siege with equal perseverance. He sur∣rounded the city with a
circumvallation of trees, <PB N="230" REF="233"/> which were laid very close
together, their branches turned towards the city. He then raised batteries
upon them, and formed a terrace sufficient to support his warlike
ma∣chines. His army worked night and day without intermission sor
seventy days, one half of the soldiers reposing themselves while the
others were at work.</P>
<P>The besieged observing the works begin to rise round them,
threw up a wooden wall up∣on the walls of the city, opposite the platform, in
order that they might always out-top the be∣siegers. This wall was covered on
the outside with hydes both raw and dry, in order to shel∣ter it from the
besiegers fires. Thus both walls seemed to vie with each other for
supe∣riority, till at last the besieged, without amus∣ing themselves
at this work any longer, built another within in the form of a half moon,
be∣hind which they might retire in case their outer works were forced.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the besiegers having mounted their engines of
war, shook the city wall in a very terrible manner; which, though it alarmed
the citizens, did not however dis∣courage them: they employed every art that
fortification could suggest against the enemy's batteries. They catched
with ropes the heads <PB N="231" REF="234"/> of the battering rams that were
urged against them, and deadened their force with levers. The besiegers
finding their attack did not go on successfully, and that a new wall was
raised against their platform, despaired of being able to storm the
place; and, therefore, changed the siege into a blockade, after having vainly
attempted to set fire to the city, which was suddenly quenched by a
shower. The city was now surrounded by a brick wall, suddenly erected,
strengthened on each side by a deep ditch. The whole army was engaged
succes∣sively upon this wall, and when it was finished they left a
guard over half of it; the Boeoti∣ans offering to guard the other half, while
the rest of the army returned to Sparta.</P>
<P>In this manner the wretched Plataeans were cooped up by a strong
wall without any hopes of redress, and only awaited the mercy of the
conqueror. There were now in Plataea but four hundred inhabitants, and
fourscore Athenians, with an hundred and ten women to dress their victuals,
and no other person, whether freeman or slave, all the rest having having
been sent to Athens before the siege. At last the inhabitants of Plataea
having lost all hopes of succour, and being in the utmost want of
provisions, formed a resolution to cut <PB N="232" REF="235"/> their way
through the enemy. But half of them struck with the greatness of the
danger, and the boldness of the enterprize, entirely lost courage when they
came to the execution, but the rest (who were about two hundred and twenty
soldiers) persisted in their resolution, and escaped in the following
manner. The besieged first took the height of the wall, by counting the
rows of bricks which composed it, and this they did at different times, and
employed several men for that purpose, in or∣der that they might not
mistake in the calcula∣tion. This was the easier, because as the wall
stood but at a small distance, every part of it was very visible. They
then made ladders of a proper length. All things being now ready for executing
the design, the besieged left the city one night when there was no moon, in
the midst of a storm of wind and rain. After cross∣ing the first
ditch they drew near the wall un∣discovered through the darkness of the
night, not to mention that the noise made by the rain and wind prevented
their being heard. They marched at some distance from one another, to
prevent the clashing of their arms, which were light, in order that those
who carried them might be the more active; and one of their legs was naked, to
keep them from slid∣ing <PB N="233" REF="236"/> so easily in the mire.
Those who carried the ladders laid them in the space between the towers,
where they knew no guard was posted, because it rained. That instant
twelve men mounted the ladders, armed with only a coat of mail and a dagger,
and marched directly to the towers, six on each side. They were fol∣lowed
by soldiers armed only with javelins, that they might mount the easier, and
their shields were carried after them to be used in the charge. When most
of these were got to the top of the wall, they were discovered by the
falling of a tile, which one of their com∣rades in taking hold of the parapet
had thrown down. The alarm was immediately given from the towers, and the whole
army ap∣proached the wall, without discovering the oc∣casion of the outcry
from the gloom of the night and the violence of the storm. Besides which,
those who had staid behind in the city, beat an alarm at the same time in
another quarter, to make a diversion, so that the ene∣my did not know which
way to turn themselves, and were afraid to quit their posts. But a corps de
reserve of three hundred men, who were kept for any unforeseen accident
that might happen, quitted the contravallation, and ran to that part where they
heard the noise, <PB N="234" REF="237"/> and torches were held up towards
Thebes, to shew that they must run that way. But those in the city, to
render the signal of no use, made others at the same time in different
quar∣ters, having prepared them on the walls for that purpose. In the mean
time, those who had mounted first having possessed themselves of
the two towers which flanked the interval where the ladders were set, and
having killed those who guarded them, posted themselves there to defend
the passage, and keep off the besiegers. Then setting ladders on the
top of the wall betwixt the two towers, they caused a good number of their
comrades to mount, in order to keep off, by the discharge of their arrows, as
well those who were advancing to the foot of the wall, as the others who were
hastening to the neighbouring towers. Whilst this was doing they had time
to set up several ladders, and to throw down the parapet, that the rest
might come up with greater ease. As fast as they came up, they went down on
the other side, and drew up near the fosse, on the outside, to shoot
at those who appeared. Af∣ter they were passed over, the men who were in
the towers came down last, and made to the fosse to follow after the
rest. That instant the guard, with three hundred torches came 
<PB N="235" REF="238"/> up. However, as the Plataeans saw their ene∣mies by
this light better than they were seen by them, they therefore took a surer
aim, by which means the last crossed the ditch without being attacked in
their passage. However, this was not done without much difficulty,
because the ditch was frozen over, and the ice would not bear on account of
thaw and heavy rains. The violence of the storm was of great advantage to
them. After all were passed they took the road towards Thebes, the better
to conceal their retreat, because it was not likely they had fled towards a
city of the enemy's. Imme∣diately they perceived the besiegers with torches
in their hands pursuing them in the road that led to Athens. After keeping
that of Thebes about six or seven stadia, they turn∣ed short towards
the mountain, and resumed the route of Athens, whither two hundred and twelve
arrived out of two hundred and twenty, who had quitted the place, the rest
having re∣turned back to it through fear, one archer ex∣cepted, who was taken
on the side of the fosse of contravallation. The besiegers, after
hav∣ing pursued them to no purpose, returned to their camp. In the mean
time, the Plataeans, who remained in the city, supposing that all their
companions had been killed, (because those <PB N="236" REF="239"/> who were
returned, to justify themselves, af∣firmed they were) sent a herald to
demand their dead bodies, but being told the true state of the affair, he
withdrew. At the end of the following campaign, the Plataeans being in
absolute want of provisions, and unable to make the least defence,
surrendered upon con∣dition that they should not be punished till they
had been tried and adjudged in form of justice. Five commissioners came
for this purpose from Lacedaemon, and these without charging them with any
crime, barely asked them whether they had done any service to the
Lacedaemonians and the allies in this war? The Plataeans were much
surprised, as well as puzzled at this question, and were sensible,
that it had been suggested by the Thebans, their professed enemies, who
had vowed their destruction. They, therefore, put the Lace∣daemonians in mind
of the services they had done to Greece in general, both at the battle of
Artemisium and that of Plataea, and particular∣ly in Lacedaemonia at the time
of the earth∣quake, which was followed by the revolt of their slaves. The
only reason they declared their having joined the Athenians afterwards, was
to defend themselves from the hostilities of the Thebans, against whom
they had im∣plored <PB N="237" REF="240"/> the assistance of the
Lacedaemonians to no purpose. That if that was imputed to them as a crime,
which was only their misfortune, it ought not, however, entirely to obliterate
the remembrance of their former services. 
<Q REND="inline">"Cast your eyes, said they, on the monuments of
your ancestors which you see here, to whom we annually pay all the honours
which can be rendered to the names of the dead. You thought fit to intrust
their bodies with us, as we were eye-witnesses of their bravery. And yet
you will now give up their ashes to their murtherers, in abandoning us to the
Thebans who fought against them at the battle of Pla∣taea? Will you enslave
a province where Greece recovered its liberty? Will you destroy the temples
of those gods to whom you owed the victory? Will you abolish the memory of
their founders who contributed so greatly to your safety? On this
occasion, we may ven∣ture to say, our interest is inseparable from your
glory, and you cannot deliver up your ancient friends and benefactors to the
unjust hatred of the Thebans, without eternal infamy to yourselves."</Q>
One would conclude, that these just remonstrances should have made
some impression on the Lacedaemonians, but they were biassed more by
the answer the <PB N="238" REF="241"/> Thebans made, and which was
expressed in the most haughty and bitter terms against the Plataeans;
and besides, they had brought their instructions from Lacedaemon. They
stood, therefore, to their first question, Whether the Plataeans had done
them any service since the war? and making them pass one after another,
as they severally answered No, each was imme∣diately butchered, and not one
escaped. About two hundred were killed in this man∣ner, and twenty-five
Athenians, who were among them, met with the same unhappy fate. Their wives,
who had been taken pri∣soners, were made slaves. The Thebans af∣terwards
peopled their city with exiles from Megara and Plataea, but the year after they
demolished it entirely. It was in this manner the Lacedaemonians, in the
hopes of reaping great advantages from the Thebans, sacrificed the Plataeans
to their animosity, ninety-three years after their first alliance with the
Athenians.</P>
<P>I pass over several particular incidents of the succeeding
campaign, in which the Gre∣cian states mutually destroyed each other,
without promoting general happiness, or esta∣blishing any common form of
government. The fluctuations of success were various. The Athenians took
the city of Pylus from the La∣cedaemonians; <PB N="239" REF="242"/> and they, on
the other hand, made annual incursions into Attica. More than one overture
for a peace was made by Cleon, who had a great ascendant among the Athenians,
and prevented their taking effect. The war was, therefore, renewed with all its
former animosities. The island of Pylus be∣came the scene of mutual
contention. De∣mosthenes, who afterwards became the cele∣brated orator, being
joined in commission with Cleon, landed on the island, in order to
dis∣possess the Lacedaemonians, who still remain∣ed there. They
attacked the enemy with great vigour, drove them from post to post, and
gaining ground perpetually, at last forced them to the extremity of the
island. The La∣cedaemonians had stormed a fort that was thought
inaccessible. There they drew up in battle array, faced about to that
side only where they could be attacked, and defended themselves like so
many lions. As the engage∣ment had held the greatest part of the day, and the
soldiers were oppressed with heat and weariness, and parched with
thirst, the gene∣ral of the Messenians directed himself to Cleon and
Demosthenes, said, that all their efforts would be to no purpose,
unless they charged their enemy's rear, and promised, if they 
<PB N="240" REF="243"/> would give him but some troops, armed with missive
weapons, that he would endeavour to find a passage. Accordingly, he and his
fol∣lowers climbed up certain steep and craggy places, which were not
guarded, when, com∣ing down unperceived into the fort, he ap∣peared on a
sudden at the backs of the Lace∣daemonians, which entirely damped their
cou∣rage, and afterwards completed their over∣throw. They now made but a very
feeble re∣sistance, and being oppressed with numbers, attacked on all
sides, and dejected through fatigue and despair, they began to give way:
but the Athenians seized on all the passes to cut off their retreat.
Cleon and Demosthenes finding, that should the battle continue, not a man
of them would escape, and being desirous of carrying them alive to Athens,
they commanded their soldiers to desist, and caused proclama∣tion to be
made by a herald for them to lay down their arms, and surrender at
discretion. At these words the greatest part lowered their shields, and
clapped their hands in token of approbation. A kind of suspension of arms
was agreed upon, and their commander desir∣ed leave might be granted him to
dispatch a messenger to the camp to know the resolution of the
generals. This was not allowed, but <PB N="241" REF="244"/> they called heralds
from the coast, and after several messages, a Lacedaemonian advanced
forward, and cried aloud, that they were per∣mitted to treat with the enemy,
provided they did not submit to dishonourable terms. Up∣on this, they held
a conference, after which they surrendered at discretion, and were kept
till the next day. The Athenians then raising a trophy, and restoring the
Lacedaemonians their dead, embarked for their own country, after distributing
the prisoners among the several ships, and committing the guard of them
to the captains of the gallies. In this battle one hundred and twenty-eight
Lacedaemonians fell out of four hundred and twenty, which was their number at
first, so that there survived not quite three hundred, an hundred and
twenty of whom were inhabitants of the city of Sparta. The siege of the
island (to compute from the beginning of it, includ∣ing the time employed in
the truce) had lasted threescore and twelve days. They all now left Pylus,
and Cleon's promise, though so vain and rash, was found literally true.
But the most surprising circumstance was the capitulation that had been
made; for, it was believed, that the Lacedaemonians, so far from
surren∣dering their arms, would die sword-in hand. <PB N="242" REF="245"/>
Being come to Athens, they were ordered to remain prisoners till a peace
should be con∣cluded, provided the Lacedaemonians did not make any
incursions into their country, for that then they should all be put to
death. They left a garrison in Pylus. The Messenians of Naupactus, who
had formerly possessed it, sent thither the flower of their youth,
who very much infested the Lacedaemonians by their in∣cursions; and, as
these Messenians spoke the language of the country, they prevailed with
a great number of slaves to join them. The La∣cedaemonians dreading a greater
evil, sent se∣veral deputations to Athens, but to no pur∣pose, the
Athenians being too much elated with their prosperity, and especially their
late success, to listen to any terms. For two or three years
successively hostilities were carried on with alternate success,
and nothing but the humbling of the one or the other of the two rival states
could decide the quarrel. The Athenians made themselves masters of the
island of Cythera; but, on the other hand, were defeated by the
Lacedaemonians at Del∣lion. At length, the two nations began to grow weary of a
war, which put them to great expence, and did not procure them any real
advantage. A truce for a year was, there∣fore, <PB N="243" REF="246"/> concluded
between them, which being expired, served to pave the way for a more
last∣ing reconciliation. The death of the two ge∣nerals that commanded the
contending armies, served not a little to hasten this event.
Brassi∣das, the Lacedaemonian, was killed as he was conducting a sally,
when besieged in Amphi∣polis; and Cleon, the Athenian, despising an enemy
to which he knew himself superior, was set upon unawares, and, slying
for safety, was killed by a soldier who happened to meet him. Thus, these
two men, who had long opposed the tranquillity of Greece, and raised their
re∣putations but in a very different way, fell a sa∣crifice to their own
ambition.</P>
<P>They were, however, men of very opposite characters. Brasidas
had courage and conduct, moderation and integrity; and, it was he alone who at
this time kept up the sinking re∣putation of his country. He was the only
Spartan since Pausanias who appeared with any established character
among the confederates, to whom he behaved so well, that they were again
brought under the dependence of Sparta; and several cities came in to him as
their common deliverer from the tyranny of Athens. The inhabitants of
Amphipolis, besides their join∣ing with the other allies in solemnizing his
fu∣neral <PB N="244" REF="247"/> in a public manner, instituted anniver∣sary
games, and sacrifices to his memory as an hero; and so far considered him
as their foun∣der, that they destroyed all the monuments which had been
preserved as marks of their be∣ing an Athenian colony. His opposition to
the peace was not so much the effects of his obstinacy, as of a true
Spartan zeal for the honour of his country, which he was sensible had been
treated by the Athenians with too much insolence and contempt. He had now a
fair prospect of bringing them to reason, as he was gaining ground upon
them, and every day making fresh conquests: and, however he might be
transported with the glory of per∣forming great actions, yet the main end of
his ambition seems to have been, the bringing the war to an happy
conclusion, I must not here omit the generous answer his mother made to
the persons who brought her the news of his death. Upon her asking them
whether he died honourably, they naturally fell into enco∣miums on his great
exploits, and his personal bravery, and preferred him to all the generals of
his time; 
<Q REND="inline">"Yes, said she, my son was a valiant man, but
Sparta has still many citi∣zens braver than he."</Q></P>
<P>Cleon was another sort of m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n. He was rash, <PB N="245" REF="248"/> arrogant, and obstinate,
contentious, envious, and malicious, covetous and corrupt, and yet, with all
these bad qualities, he had some little arts of popularity which raised
and supported him. He made it his business to caress the old men; and,
as much as he loved money, he often re∣lieved the poor. He had a ready wit,
with a way of drollery, that took with many, though with the generality it
passed for impudence and buffoonry. He had one very refined way of
recommending himself, which was, upon his coming into power, to discard all
his old friends, for fear it should be thought he would be biassed by
them. At the same time, he picked up a vile set of sycophants in their
room, and made a servile court to the lowest dregs of the people; and yet,
even they had so bad an opinion of him, that they often de∣clared against
him for Nicias, his professed enemy; who, though he took part with the
no∣bility, still preserved an interest in the com∣mons, and was more
generally respected. That which Cleon chiefly depended on, was his
elo∣quence; but it was of a boisterous kind, ver∣bose and petulant, and
consisted more in the vehemence of his style and utterance, and the
distortion of his action and gesture, than in the strength of his
reasoning. By this furious <PB N="246" REF="249"/> manner of harranguing, he
introduced among the orators and statesmen a licentiousness and
indecency which were not known before, and which gave rise to the many
riotous and disor∣derly proceedings which were afterwards in the
assemblies, when almost every thing was carried by noise and tumult. In
the military part of his service, he was as unaccountable as in the rest of
his conduct. He was not na∣turally formed for war, and only made use of it as
a cloak for his ill practices, and because he could not carry on his other
views without it. His taking Sphacteria was certainly a great action, but it
was a rash and desperate one; and it has been shewn how he was
unde∣signedly drawn into it by a boast of his own. However, he was so
elated with the suc∣cess of that expedition, that he fancied himself a
general, and the people were brought to have the same opinion. But the event
soon undeceived them, and convinced them that he knew better how to lead in
the assembly than in the field. In reality, he was not a man to be
trusted in either. For, in the one he was more of a blusterer than of a
sol∣dier, and in the other, he had more of an in∣cendiary than of a
patriot.</P>
<P>The Lacedaemonians were no less inclined to <PB N="247" REF="250"/>
peace than the Athenians and were glad to treat at this time while they could
do it with honour: besides, they had nothing more at heart than the
imprisonment of their men taken at Pylus, they being the chief of their city;
and, among other considerations, it was not the least, that the truce which
they had made for Argos for thirty years, was just upon expiring. This was a
strong and flourishing city, and though it was not of itself a match for
Sparta, yet they knew it was far from being contemptible, and that it held too
good a correspondence with its neighbours, not to make itself capable of
giv∣ing them a great deal of uneasiness. The mat∣ter having been
canvassed and debated most part of the winter, the Lacedaemonians, to
bring the treaty to a conclusion, gave out, that they resolved as soon as
the season would per∣mit to fortify in Attica. Upon which, the Athenians
grew more moderate in their de∣mands, and a peace was concluded in the tenth
year of the war between the two states and their confederates for fifty
years. The chief articles being, that the garrisons should be eva∣cuated,
and the towns and prisoners restored on both sides. This was called the
Nician peace, because Nicias, who was just the reverse of his rival
Cleon, was the chief instrument in <PB N="248" REF="251" MS="y"/> it.
Besides the tender concern he always ex∣pressed for his country, he had
more particu∣lar ends in it, in securing his reputation. For he had been upon
many expeditions, and had generally succeeded in them; but yet he was
sensible how much he owed to his good for∣tune and his cautious management,
and he did not care to risque what he had already got for the hopes of
more.</P>

<DIV1 N="10" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. From the Peace of NICIAS to the end of the
PELOPONNESSIAN War.</HEAD>
<P>EVERY thing now promised a restoration of former tranquillity.
The Boeotians and Co∣rinthians were the first that shewed signs of
discontent, and used their utmost endeavours to excite fresh troubles.
To obviate any dan∣gers arising from that quarter, the Athenians and
Lacedaemonians united in a league offensive and defensive, which served
to render them more formidable to their neighbouring states, and more
assured with regard to each other. Yet still the former animosities and
jealousies fermented at bottom, and while friendship <PB N="249" REF="252"/>
seemed to gloss over external appearances, fresh discontents were
gathering below. The character indeed of Nicias was peaceable, and he did all
in his power to persuade the Athe∣nians to cultivate their general
tranquillity. But a new promoter of troubles was now be∣ginning to make his
appearance, and from him, those who wished for peace had every thing to
fear. This was no other than the celebrated Alcibiades, the disciple of
Socrates, a youth equally remarkable for the beauty of his per∣son and the
greatness of his mental accom∣plishments.</P>
<P>The strict intimacy between Alcibiades and Socrates is one of the
most remarkable cir∣cumstances of his life. This philosopher ob∣serving
excellent natural qualities in him, which were greatly heightened by the beauty
of his person, bestowed incredible pains in cul∣tivating so valuable a
plant, lest, being neglect∣ed, it should wither as it grew, and
absolutely degenerate: and, indeed, Alcibiades was ex∣posed to numberless
dangers; the greatness of his extraction, his vast riches, the authority of
his family, the credit of his guardians, his personal talents, his
exquisite beauty, and, still more than these, the flattery and
complaisance of all who approached him. One would have <PB N="250" REF="253"/>
concluded, says Plutarch, that fortune had surrounded and invested him
with all these pretended advantages, as with so many ram∣parts and
bulwarks, to render him inaccessible and invulnerable to all the darts of
philosophy, those salutary darts which strike to the very heart, and
leave in it the strongest incitements to virtue and solid glory. But
those very ob∣stacles redoubled the zeal of Socrates. Not∣withstanding
the strong endeavours that were used to divert this young Athenian from a
cor∣respondence which alone was capable of secur∣ing him from so many
snares, he devoted himself entirely to it; he had the most unbounded wit;
he was fully sensible of Socrates's extraordinary merit, and could not
resist the charms of his sweetly insinuating eloquence, which at that
time had a greater ascendent over him than the allurements of pleasure. He
was so zeal∣ous a disciple of that great master, that he fol∣lowed him
wherever he went, took the utmost delight in his conversation, was
extremely well pleased with his principles, received his instructions, and
even his reprimands, with wonderful docility, and was so moved with his
discourses, as even to shed tears and abhor himself; so weighty was
the force of truth in the mouth of Socrates, and in so <PB N="251" REF="254"/>
odious a light did he expose the vices to which Alcibiades abandoned
himself. Alci∣biades in those moments when he listened to Socrates,
differed so much from himself, that he appeared quite another man. However,
his head-strong fiery temper, and his natural fond∣ness for pleasure,
which was heightened and inflamed by the discourses and advice of young
people, soon plunged him into his former irre∣gularities, and tore him as it
were from his master<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, who was
obliged to pursue him as a slave who had escaped correction. This
vicissi∣tude of flights and returns of virtuous resolu∣tions and
relapses into vice, continued a long time, but still Socrates was not
disgusted by his levity, and always flattered himself with the hopes of
bringing him back to his duty; and hence certainly arose the strong mixture
of good and evil that always appeared in his conduct; the instructions which
his master had given him sometimes prevailing, and, at other times, the
fire of his passions hurrying him, in a manner, against his own will into
things of a quite opposite nature. Among the various passions that were
discovered in him, the strongest and most prevailing was a haughty turn
of mind, which would force all things to submit to it, and could not bear a
superior, <PB N="252" REF="255"/> or even an equal. Although his birth and
un∣common talents smoothed the way to his at∣taining the highest
employments in the re∣public, there was nothing however to which he was so
fond of owing the credit and autho∣rity he wanted to gain over the people, as
to the force of his eloquence, and the persuasive grace of his orations. To
this, his intimacy with Socrates might be of great service. Al∣cibiades with
such a cast of mind as we here described, was not born for repose, and
had set every engine at work to traverse the treaty lately concluded
between the two states, but not succeeding in his attempt, he endeavoured
to prevent its taking effect. He was disgusted at the Lacedaemonians,
because they directed themselves only to Nicias, of whom they had a very
high opinion; and, on the contrary, seemed to take no manner of notice of
him, though his ancestors had enjoyed the rights of hospitality among them.
The first thing he did to infringe the peace was this: having been informed
that the people of Argos only wanted an opportunity to break with the
Spar∣tans, whom they equally hated and feared, he flattered them secretly
with the hopes that the Athenians would succour them, by suggest∣ing to
them, that they were ready to break a <PB N="253" REF="256"/> peace which was no
way advantageous to them. Accordingly, he laid hold of this junc∣ture, and
improved the pretext the Lacedae∣monians had given to exasperate the people
both against them and Nicias; which had so good an effect, that every thing
seemed dispos∣ed for a treaty with Argos: of which, the La∣cedaemonians
being very apprehensive, imme∣diately dispatched their ambassadors to
Athens, who at first said what seemed very satisfactory, that they came
with full power to concert all matters in difference upon equal terms. The
council received their propositions, and the people were to assemble the
next day to give them audience. Alcibiades, in the mean while, fearing lest
this negociation would ruin his designs, had a secret conference with the
ambassadors, and persuaded them, under a co∣lour of friendship, not to
let the people know at first what full powers their commission gave them,
but intimate, that they came only to treat and make proposals, for that
otherwise they would grow insolent in their demands, and extort from them
such unreasonable terms as they could not with honour consent to. They
were so well satisfied with the prudence and sincerity of this advice,
that he drew them from Nicias to rely intirely upon himself: and, the 
<PB N="254" REF="257"/> next day, when the people were assembled, and the
ambassadors introduced, Alcibiades, with a very obliging air, demanded of
them with what powers they were come? They made answer, that they were not
come as plenipo∣tentiaries. Upon which he instantly changed his voice and
countenance, and exclaiming against them as notorious liars, bid the people
take care how they transacted any thing with men on whom they could have so
little depen∣dence. The people dismissed the ambassadors in a rage,
and Nicias knowing nothing of the deceit, was confounded and in disgrace. To
redeem his credit, he proposed being sent once more to Sparta: but not
being able to gain such terms there as the Athenians demanded, they
immediately upon his return struck up a league with the Argives for an
hundred years, including the Eleans and Mantineans, which yet did not in terms
cancel that with the Lace∣daemonians, though it is plain, that the whole intent
of it was levelled against them. Upon this new alliance, Alcibiades was
declared ge∣neral; and though his best friends could not commend the method
by which he brought about his designs, yet it was looked upon as a great
reach in politics, thus to divide and shake almost all Peloponnesus, and
to remove <PB N="255" REF="258"/> the war so far from the Athenian frontier,
that even success would profit the enemy but little should they be
conquerors; whereas, if they were defeated, Sparta itself would be hardly
safe.</P>
<P>This defection of the confederates began to awaken the jealousy of
Sparta, they resolved, therefore, to remedy the evil before it spread too
far; wherefore, drawing out their whole force, both of citizens and slaves,
and being joined by their allies, they encamped almost under the walls of
Argos. The Argives hav∣ing notice of their march, made all possible
preparations, and came out with a full resolu∣tion to fight them. But just
as they were go∣ing to engage, two of their officers went over to Agis, the
Spartan king and general, and proposed to him to have the business made
up by a reference. He immediately closing with the offer, in order to it,
granted them a truce for four months, and drew off his army; the whole affair
being transacted by these three, without any general consent or knowledge
on either side. The Peloponnesians, though they durst not disobey their
orders, inveighed griev∣ously against Agis for letting such an advantage
slip as they could never promise to themselves again. For they had
actually hemmed in the <PB N="256" REF="259"/> enemy, and that with the best,
if not the greatest army, that ever was brought into the field. And the
Argives were so little appre∣hensive of danger on their side, that they
were no less incensed against their mediators, one of whom they forced to
the altars to save his life, and confiscated his goods.</P>
<P>Thus every thing seemed to favour the Athe∣nian interest; and
their prosperity, for this was the most flourishing period of their
duration, blinded them to such a degree, that they were persuaded no power
was able to resist them. In this disposition they resolved to take
the first opportunity of adding the island of Sicily to their empire, and
soon an occasion offered to their wish. Ambassadors were sent from
the people of Egesta, who, in quality of their allies, came to implore their
aid against the inhabi∣tants of Selinuta, who were assisted by the
Syracusans. It was the sixteenth year of the Peloponnesian war. They
represented, among other things, that should they be abandoned, the
Syracusans, after seizing their city, as they had done that of Leontium,
would possess themselves of all Sicily, and not fail to aid the
Peloponnesians, who were their founders; and, that they might put them to as
little charge as possible, they offered to pay the troops that 
<PB N="257" REF="260"/> should be sent to succour them. The Athe∣nians,
who had long waited for an opportuni∣ty to declare themselves, sent
deputies to Egesta to enquire into the state of affairs, and to see
whether there was money enough in the treasury to defray the expence of so
great a war. The inhabitants of that city had been so artful as to borrow
from the neighbouring na∣tions a great number of gold and silver vases,
worth an immense sum of money, and of these they made a shew when the
Athenians arrived. The deputies returned with those of Egesta, who carried
threescore talents in ingots, as a month's pay for the gallies which they
de∣manded and a promise of larger sums, which they said were ready both
in the public treasury and in the temples. The people struck with these
fair appearances, the truth of which they did not give themselves the
leisure to examine; and, seduced by the advantageous reports which their
deputies made with the view of pleasing them, immediately granted the
Eges∣tans their demand, and appointed Alcibiades, Nicias, and Lamachus, to
command the fleet, with full power not only to succour Egesta, and
restore the inhabitants of Leontium to their city, but also to regulate the
affairs of Sicily, in such a manner as might best suit the 
<PB N="258" REF="261"/> interests of the republic. Nicias was appoint∣ed one
of the generals to his very great regret; for, besides other motives, which
made him dread that command, he shunned it because Alcibiades was to be his
colleague. But the Athenians promised themselves greater success from
this war, should they not resign the whole conduct of it to Alcibiades, but
temper his ardour and audacity with the coldness and wisdom of Nicias.
Nicias not daring to op∣pose Alcibiades openly, endeavoured to do it
indirectly, by starting a great number of dif∣ficulties, drawn particularly
from the great ex∣pence of this expedition. He declared, that since they were
resolved upon war, they ought to carry it on in such a manner as might
suit the exalted reputation to which Athens had at∣tained. That a fleet was
not sufficient to op∣pose so formidable a power as that of the
Syra∣cusans and their allies: that they must raise an army composed of
good horse and foot, if they desired to act in a manner worthy of so
noble a design; that, besides their fleet, which was to make them masters
at sea, they must have a great number of transports to carry
pro∣visions perpetually to the army, which otherwise could not possibly
subsist in an enemy's country: that they must carry vast sums of
money with <PB N="259" REF="262"/> them, without waiting for that promised
them by the citizens of Egesta, who perhaps were ready in words only, and
very probably might break their promise: that they ought to weigh and examine
the disparity there was between themselves and their enemies with regard to
the conveniencies and wants of the army, the Syracusans being in their own
country, in the midst of powerful allies, disposed by inclina∣tion, as
well as engaged by interest, to assist them with men, arms, horses,
and provisions; whereas, the Athenians would carry on the war in a remote
country, possessed by their enemies, where, in the winter, news could
not be brought them in less than four months time; a country where all things
would oppose the Athenians, and nothing be procured but by force of arms:
that it would reflect the greatest ignominy on the Athenians, should they
be forced to abandon their enterprize, and thereby become the scorn and
contempt of their enemies, by their neglecting to take all the precautions
which so important a design required: that as for himself, he was
deter∣mined not to go unless he was provided with all things necessary
for the expedition, because the safety of the whole army depended on that
circumstance; and that he would not rely <PB N="260" REF="263"/> on caprice,
or the precarious engagements of the allies. Nicias had flattered himself,
that this speech would cool the ardour of the people, whereas it only
inflamed it the more. Imme∣diately the generals had full powers given them to
raise as many troops, and fit out as many gallies as they should judge
necessary; and the levies were accordingly carried on in Athens, and other
places, with inexpressible activity.</P>
<P>When prepared, they accordingly set sail, after having appointed
Corcyra the rendezvous for most of the allies, and such ships as were to
carry the provisions and warlike stores. All the citizens, as well as
foreigners in Athens, flocked by day-break to the port of Pyraeus. The former
attended by their children, rela∣tions, friends, and companions, with a joy
overcast with a little sorrow, upon their bid∣ding adieu to persons that
were as dear to them as life, who were setting out on a distant and very
dangerous expedition, from which it was uncertain whether they would ever
return, though they flattered themselves with the hopes that it would be
successful. The foreigners came thither to feed their eyes with a sight
which was highly worthy their curiosity, for no single city in the world
had <PB N="261" REF="264"/> ever fitted out so gallant a fleet. Those indeed
which had been sent against Epidaurus and Potidaea, were as considerable
with regard to the number of soldiers and ships, but then they were not
equipped with so much magni∣ficence, neither was their voyage so long, nor
their enterprize so important. Here were seen a land and a naval army
provided with the ut∣most care, and at the expence of particular persons,
as well as of the public, with all things necessary on account of the
length of the voyage, and the duration of the war. The city furnished an
hundred empty gallies, that is threescore light ones, and forty to
trans∣port the soldiers heavily armed. Every ma∣riner received daily a
drachma, or ten pence English, for his pay, exclusively of what the
captains of ships gave the rowers of the first bench. Add to this, the pomp
and magni∣ficence that was displayed universally, every one striving to
eclipse the rest, and each cap∣tain endeavouring to make his ship the
lightest, and, at the same time, the gayest in the whole fleet. I shall
not take notice of the choice of the soldiers and seamen, who were the
flower of the Athenians, nor of their emulation with regard to the beauty and
neatness of their arms and equipage, any more than of their officers, 
<PB N="262" REF="265"/> who had laid out considerable sums purely to
distinguish themselves, and to give foreigners an advantageous idea of
their persons and cir∣cumstances, so that this sight had the air of a
pageant, in which the utmost magnificence is displayed, rather than of a
warlike expedi∣tion. But the boldness and greatness of the design still
exceeded its expence and splendor.</P>
<P>When the ships were loaded, and the troops got on board, the
trumpet sounded, and so∣lemn prayers were offered up for the success of
the expedition; gold and silver cups were fill∣ing every where with wine, and
the accustom∣ed libations were poured out; the people who lined the shore
shouting, at the same time, and lifting up their hands to heaven to wish
their fellow-citizens a good voyage and success. And now the hymn being
sung, and the cere∣monies ended, the ships sailed one after an∣other out
of the harbour, after which they strove to outsail one another, till the
whole fleet met at Aegina. From thence it made to to Corcyra, where the army of
the allies was assembled with the rest of the fleet.</P>
<P>Being now arrived at Sicily, the generals were divided in their
opinions as to the place where they should make a descent. Lamachus, one of
the generals, was for making directly <PB N="263" REF="266"/> for Syracuse. He
urged, that it was as yet unprovided, and under the greatest
con∣sternation; that an army was always most terrible on its approach
before the enemy had time to recollect and make danger familiar; these
reasons, however, were over-ruled. It was agreed to reduce the smaller
cities first, when having detached ten gallies only to take a view of the
situation and harbour of Syra∣cuse, they landed with the rest of their
forces, and surprised Catana.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the enemies of Alcibiades had taken occasion
from his absence, to attack him with redoubled vigour. They aggravated his
misconduct in neglecting the proper me∣thod of attack, and enforced their
accusation, by alledging, that he had prophaned the my∣steries of Ceres;
this was sufficient to induce the giddy multitude to recal their general, but
for fear of raising a tumult in the army, they only sent him orders to
return to Athens to pacify the people by his presence. Alcibiades obeyed the
orders with seeming submission, but reflecting on the inconstancy and
caprice of his judges, the instant he was arrived at Thurium, and had got on
shore, he disappeared, and eluded the pursuit of those who sought
after him; the galley, therefore, returned without <PB N="264" REF="267"/> him,
and the people in a rage condemned him to death for his contumacy. His whole
estate was confiscated, and all the orders of religion were commanded to
curse him. Some time after, news being brought him that the Atheni∣ans had
condemned him to death; I hope one day, saith he, to make them sensible
that I am still alive.</P>
<P>The Syracusans had by this time put them∣selves in a posture
of defence, and finding that Nicias did not advance towards them, they talked
of attacking him in his camp; and some of them asked, in a scoffing way,
Whether he was come into Sicily to settle at Catana? He was roused by this
insult, and resolved to make the best of his way to Syracuse. He
durst not attempt it by land for want of ca∣valry, and he thought it equally
hazardous to make a descent by sea upon an enemy who was so well prepared
to receive him: however, he chose the latter way, and succeeded in it by a
stratagem. He had gained a citizen of Ca∣tana to go as a deserter to the
Syracusans, and informed them, that the Athenians lay every night in the town
without their arms; and that early in the morning, on a certain day ap∣pointed,
they might surprize them, seize on their camp with all their arms and
baggage, <PB N="265" REF="268"/> burn their fleet in the harbour, and destroy
the whole army. The Syracusans gave cre∣dit to him, and marched with all
their forces towards Catana; which Nicias had no sooner notice of, but he
embarked his troops, and steering away for Syracuse, landed them there the
next morning, and fortified himself in the out-skirts of the town. The
Syracusans were so provoked at this trick being put upon them, that they
immediately returned to Syra∣cuse, and presented themselves without the
walls in order of battle. Nicias marched out of his trenches to meet them, and
a very sharp action ensued, wherein, at length, the Athe∣nians got the
better, and forced the enemy back to the city, after having killed two hun∣dred
and sixty of them and their confederates, with the loss of fifty of their
own men. They were not as yet in a condition to attack the city, and therefore
took up their winter quarters at Catana and Naxus.</P>
<P>The year following greater projects were undertaken, for, having
received a supply of horse from Athens, with provisions, and other
stores of war, Nicias set sail for Syracuse, in order to block it up by
sea and land. In this manner did the little state of Athens spread terror
among all the neighbouring states, and <PB N="266" REF="269"/> now risen to
its utmost height, began to aspire at universal empire. Athens had
already been the mistress of arts and philosophy, it now, with inverted
ambition, aimed at setting man∣kind an example of the arts of conquest and
of war, but they had never considered that a petty state raised
artificially into power, is liable to a thousand accidents in its way to
conquest; they had now sent out their whole force into Sicily, and while
they fought to decide the fate of Syracuse, they were in fact contending for
their own; the existence of Athens and Syracuse depended so much on the
event of the present invasion, that both sides fought with the utmost
perseverance, and historians have been minute in the detail.</P>
<P>The siege was now carried on in a more re∣gular and skilful
manner than had ever been practised before, and men were taught a new
lesson now, as well in the arts of attack as of defence. Nicias found it
necessary, in the first place, to gain Epipolae, an high hill which
commanded the city, and had a steep craggy passage up to it. The
Syracusans were so sen∣sible of the importance of this post, that
they had ordered a detachment of seven hundred men to march upon a signal
given to the de∣fence of it. But Nicias had landed his men 
<PB N="267" REF="270"/> in a little remote harbour so secretly and so
suddenly, that they easily made themselves masters of it. And the
seven hundred running up from the plains in a confused manner to
dispossess them, were repulsed with the loss of three hundred of
them and their leader. Nicias built a fort there, as a magazine, and proceeded
to invest the town on the land-side, so as to prevent any communication
with the country. The enemy endeavouring to defeat his works, and render them
useless, several skirmishes ensued, wherein the Athenians had
generally the better: but, in one of them, Lamachus being pressed hard, and
abandoned by his men, was killed. The Syracusans be∣ing still intent on the
recovery of Epipolae, or∣dered up another detachment thither. Nicias was at
this time sick in the fort, and in bed, with only his servants about him.
But when he found the enemy were forcing his intrench∣ments, he got up and
set fire to the engines, and other wood that lay scattered about the fort;
which had so good an effect, that it served as a signal to his own troops
to come up to his relief, and so terrified and confound∣ed those of the
enemy, that they retreated into the city. From thenceforth, Nicias, who was now
sole general, conceived great hopes; for <PB N="268" REF="271"/> several
cities of Sicily, which hitherto had not declared for either side, came and
joined him, and there arrived from all quarters vessels laden with
provisions for his army, all parties being eager to go over to him, because
he had ac∣quired the superiority, and been exceedingly successful in all
his undertakings. The Syra∣cusans seeing themselves blocked up both by
sea and land, and losing all hopes of being able to defend their city any
longer, already proposed an accommodation. Gylippus, who was com∣ing from
Lacedaemon to their assistance, hav∣ing heard in his passage the
extremity to which they were reduced, and looking upon the whole island as
lost, sailed forward neverthe∣less, not in the view of defending Sicily,
but on∣ly to preserve to the nations of Italy such ci∣ties as were
subject to them in that island, if it were not too late, and if this could
be done; for fame had declared in all places, that the Athenians had already
possessed themselves of the whole island, and were headed by a
gene∣ral whose wisdom and good fortune rendered him invincible.</P>
<P>The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ortifications of the
Athenians were now almost completed, they had drawn a double wall near half a
league in length along the plain and the fens towards the great port, 
<PB N="269" REF="272"/> and had almost reached it. There now re∣mained on one
side only a small part of the wall to be finished, and the Syracusans
were upon the brink of ruin; they had no hopes left; they were unable to defend
themselves, and they knew not where to look for succours; for this
reason, they resolved to surrender, and a council was held to settle
the articles of capi∣tulation which were to be presented to Nicias.</P>
<P>It was at that very instant, and in this most distressful
juncture, that a messenger arrived at Syracuse from Corinth with news of
speedy re∣lief. The whole body of citizens flocked round the messenger of
such welcome information. He gave them to understand, that Gylippus, the
Lacedaemonian general, would be with them immediately, and was followed by a
great many other gallies which came to his aid. The Syracusans
astonished, or rather stupefied as it were with this news, could scarce
believe what they heard. Whilst they were thus sluc∣tuating and in doubt, a
courier arrived from Gylippus to inform them of his approach, and ordered them
to march over all their troops to meet him. He himself after taking a fort in
his way, marched in order of battle directly for Epi∣polae, and ascending by
Euryclus as the Athe∣nians had done, he prepared to attack them 
<PB N="270" REF="273"/> from without, whilst the Syracusians should charge
them on their side with the forces of Syracuse. The Athenians, exceedingly
surprised by his arrival, drew up hastily, and without order under the
wall; with re∣gard to himself, laying down his arms when he approached, he
sent word by a herald, that he would allow the Athenians five days to leave
Sicily. Nicias did not condescend to make the least answer to this
proposal; and some of his soldiers bursting out a laughing, asked the
herald, whether the presence of a Lacedaemo∣nian privateer, and the trifling
wand of an herald, could make any change in the present state of the city?
Both sides, therefore, pre∣pared for battle.</P>
<P>Gylippus began by storming the fort of Lab∣dalla, and cutting in
pieces all who were found in it. The Athenians, in the mean time, were not idle
in forming entrenchments to oppose him, while the besieged were equally
assiduous in cutting down and breaking through those walls and
circumvallations which were carried round their city. At length, both sides
drew up their forces in battle array between the walls, which the Athenians had
raised to keep off the enemy. In the first engagement the cavalry of
Gylippus being rendered useless <PB N="271" REF="274"/> from the
narrowness of the place, to re-ani∣mate his soldiers, by doing them
justice, he had the courage to reproach himself for the ill success
they had met with, and to declare publicly, that he, not they, had occasioned
the late defeat, because he had made them fight in too narrow a spot of
ground. How∣ever, he promised soon to give them an oppor∣tunity of
recovering both their honour and his; and, accordingly, the very next day he
led them against the enemy, after having ex∣horted them in the strongest
terms to behave in a manner worthy of their ancient glory. Nicias perceiving,
that though he should not desire to come to a battle, it would, however, be
absolutely necessary for him to prevent the enemy from extending their
line beyond the contravallation, to which they were already very near,
(because otherwise this would be grant∣ing them a certain victory)
therefore, march∣ed boldly against the Syracusans. Gylippus brought up his
troops beyond that place where the walls terminated on both sides, in order
that he might leave the more room to extend his battle, when, charging the
enemy's left wing with his horse, he put it to flight, and soon after
defeated their right. We have an instance of what the experience and
abilities of <PB N="272" REF="275"/> a great captain are capable of producing;
for Gylippus, with the same men, the same arms, the same horses, and
the same ground, by on∣ly changing his order of battle, defeated the
Athenians, and beat them quite to their camp. The following night the victors
carried on their wall beyond the contravallation of the Athe∣nians, and thereby
deprived them of all hopes of being ever able to surround the city. Nicias
had ever since the arrival of Gylippus been put upon the defensive, and as
he daily lost ground in the country, he retired towards the sea, to keep
that open in case of accidents, and to bring in provisions. For this
purpose, he possessed himself of Plemmyrium, near the great
harbour, where he built three forts, and kept himself up as it were in
garrison. Gylip∣pus took this opportunity to gain over the in∣land cities;
and, at the same time, arrived the fleet which was expected from Corinth.
Nici∣as, under these circumstances, wrote a very melancholy account of his
affairs to Athens; that the enemy were become so superior to him, that he
was not in a condition to force their intrenchments; and, that instead of
be∣sieging them, he was now besieged himself; that the towns revolted
from him; the slaves and mercenaries deserted; that his troops were 
<PB N="273" REF="276"/> employed in guarding the forts and fetching in
provisions, and that in this latter service many of them were cut off by
the enemy's horse. That the fleet was in as bad a condition as the army; and
that, in short, without a speedy re∣inforcement of men, ships, and money,
equal to what he had at first set out with, it was in vain to attempt any
thing farther: then, as to his own particular, he complained of his being
afflicted with sharp nephritic pains, which ren∣dered him incapable of going
on with the ser∣vice; and, therefore, pressed to be recalled." The
Athenians were so affected with this letter, that they named Eurymedon and
Demosthenes to go over with fresh supplies, the former im∣mediately with
ten gallies, and the other early in the spring with a stronger force. At
the same time, they appointed Menander and Eu∣thydemus to act as
assistants to Nicias, but would not grant his request of coming home.
In the mean time, Gylippus, who had made the tour of Sicily, returned with as
many men as he could raise in the whole island, and pre∣vailed with the
Syracusans to fit out the strongest sleet in their power, and to hazard
a battle at sea, upon the presumption that the success would answer
the greatness of the enterprize. This advice was strongly enforced by
Hermo∣crates, <PB N="274" REF="277"/> who exhorted the Syracusans not to
abandon to their enemies the empire of the seas. He observed, that the
Athenians them∣selves had not received it from their ancestors, nor been
always possessed of it; that the Per∣sian war had in a manner forced
them into the knowledge of naval affairs, notwithstanding two great
obstacles, their disposition, and the situation of their city, which
stood at a consi∣derable distance from the sea: that they had made
themselves formidable to other nations, not so much by their real
strength, as by their courage and intrepidity: that they ought to copy them;
and since they had to do with ene∣mies who were so enterprising, it was
fit they should be equally daring.</P>
<P>This advice was approved, and accordingly a large fleet was
equipped. Gylippus led out all his land-forces in the night-time to attack the
forts of Plemmyrium. Thirty-five gallies of Syracuse, which were in the great
harbour, and forty-five in the lesser, where was an ar∣senal for ships,
were ordered to advance to∣wards Plemmyrium, to amaze the Athenians, who would
find themselves attacked both by sea and land at the same time. The
Athenians at this news went on board also, and with twenty∣five ships
sailed to fight the thirty-five Syracu∣san <PB N="275" REF="278"/>
vessels, which were sailing out against them from the great harbour,
and opposed thirty-five more to the forty-five of the enemy which were come
out of the little port. A sharp engage∣ment was fought at the mouth of the
great harbour, one party endeavouring to force their way into it, and the other
to keep them out.</P>
<P>Those who defended the forts of Plemmy∣rium having flocked to the
shore to view the battle, Gylippus attacked the forts unexpect∣edly by
day-break; and having carried the greatest of them by storm, the soldiers
who de∣fended the other two, were so terrified, that they abandoned them in a
moment. After this advantage the Syracusans sustained a con∣siderable
loss, for such of their vessels as fought at the entrance of the
harbour, (after having forced the Athenians) bulged furiously one against
the other, as they entered it in dis∣order; and, by this means, shifted the
victory to their enemies, who were not contented with pursuing, but also
gave chace to those who were victorious in the great harbour. Eleven
Syracusan gallies were sunk, and great num∣bers of the sailors in them
killed. Three were taken; but the Athenians likewise lost three, and after
towing off those of the enemy, they <PB N="276" REF="279"/> raised a trophy
in a little island lying before Plemmyrium, and retired to the center of
their camp.</P>
<P>One circumstance which the besieged consi∣dered of the
greatest importance, was to at∣tempt a second engagement both by sea and
land, before the fleet and other succours sent by the Athenians should
arrive. They had concerted fresh measures for a battle at sea, by
improving from the errors they had committed in the last engagement. The
change made in the gallies was, their prows were now shorter, and, at the
same time, stronger and more solid than before. For this purpose, they
fixed great pieces of timber projecting forward on each side of the prows,
and to these pieces they joined beams by way of props. The beams extended to
the length of six cubits on each side of the vessel both within and
without. By this they hoped to gain an advantage over the gallies of the
Athenians, which did not dare, because of the weakness of their prows, to
attack an enemy in front, but only in flank, not to mention, that should the
battle be fought in the harbour, they would not have room to spread
themselves, nor to pass between two gallies, in which lay their greatest
art, nor to tack about after they should have been repulsed, 
<PB N="277" REF="280"/> in order to return to the charge; whereas, the
Syracusans by their being masters of the whole extent of the harbour, would
have all these advantages, and might reciprocally assist one another.
On these circumstances the latter founded their hopes of victory.</P>
<P>Gylippus, therefore, first drew all the infan∣try out of the camp,
and advanced towards that part of the contravallation of the Atheni∣ans which
faced the city, whilst the troops of Olympia marched towards the other, and
their gallies set sail.</P>
<P>Nicias did not care to venture a second bat∣tle, saying, that as
he expected a fresh fleet every moment, and a great reinforcement un∣der
Demosthenes, it would betray the greatest want of judgment, should he, as
his troops were inferior in number to those of the enemy, and already
fatigued, hazard a battle without being forced to it. On the contrary,
Menan∣der and Euthydemus, who had just before been appointed to share the
command with Nicias till the arrival of Demosthenes, fired with ambition, and
jealous of those generals, were eager to perform some great exploit, to
bereave the one of his glory, and if possible eclipse that of the other.
The pretence they alledged on this occasion was, the fame and 
<PB N="278" REF="281"/> reputation of Athens; and they asserted with so
much vehemence, that it would be entirely destroyed should they shun the
battle as the Syracusans offered it them, that they at last forced Nicias
to a compliance. The Athe∣nians had seventy-five gallies, and the
Syracu∣sans eighty.</P>
<P>The first day the fleets continued in sight of each other, in
the great harbour, without en∣gaging, and only a few skirmishes passed,
af∣ter which both parties retired; while the land-forces acted in the same
manner. The Syracu∣sans did not make the least motion the second day.
Nicias, taking advantage of this inactivity, caused the transports to draw
up in a line at some distance from one another, in order that his gallies
might retire behind them with safe∣ty, in case he should be defeated. On
the mor∣row the Syracusans came up sooner than usual, when a great part
of the day was spent in skir∣mishing, after which they retired. The
Athe∣nians did not suppose they would return, but imagined that fear would
make them fly. But having refreshed themselves in great diligence, and
returning on board their gallies, they at∣tacked the Athenians, who were far
from ex∣pecting them. The latter being now forced to return immediately on
board their ships, <PB N="279" REF="282"/> they entered them in great
disorder; so that they had not time to draw them up in a line of battle,
and most of the sailors were fasting. Victory did not long continue in
suspence. The Athenians, after making a short and slight
re∣sistance, retired behind their line of trans∣ports. The enemy
pursued them thither, but were stopped by the yards of those ships to
which were fixed dolphins of lead: these being very heavy, had they fallen on
the enemy's gallies, would have sunk them at once. The Athenians lost
seven gallies in this engagement, and a great number of soldiers were
either kill∣ed or taken prisoners.</P>
<P>This loss threw Nicias into the utmost con∣sternation: all the
misfortunes he had met with ever since the time he had enjoyed the supreme
command, came into his mind, and he was now involved in a greater than any of
them, by his complying with the advice of his colleagues. Whilst he was
revolving these gloomy ideas, Demosthenes's fleet was seen coming forward
in great pomp, and with such an air as might fill the enemy with dread. It
was now the day after the battle. This fleet consisted of seventy-three
gallies, on board of which were five thousand fighting men, and about three
thousand archers, slingers, and <PB N="280" REF="283"/> bowmen. All these
gallies were richly trim∣med, their prows being adorned with shining
streamers, manned with stout rowers, com∣manded by good officers, and
echoing with the sound of clarions and trumpets, Demost∣henes having
affected an air of pomp and tri∣umph purposely to strike terror into the
enemy.</P>
<P>This gallant sight alarmed them indeed be∣yond expression.
They did not see any end, or even the least suspension of their
calamities. All they had hitherto done or suffered was as nothing, and their
work was to begin again. What hopes could they entertain of being able to weary
out the patience of the Athenians, since, though they had a camp in∣trenched
in the middle of Attica, were how∣ever able to send a second army into
Sicily as considerable as the former, and that their power, as well as their
courage, seemed, not∣withstanding all their losses, instead of
diminish∣ing, to increase daily.</P>
<P>Demosthenes having made an exact enquiry into the state of
things, imagined it would not be proper for him to lose time as Nicias had
done, who having spread an universal terror at his first arrival,
becau<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> afterwards the object of
contempt for his having wintered in Catana, <PB N="281" REF="284"/> instead of
going directly to Syracuse, and had afterwards given Gylippus an opportunity
of throwing troops into it. He flattered himself with the hopes that he
should be able to carry the city at the first attack, by taking advan∣tage
of the alarm which the news of his arrival would spread in every part of it,
and by that means should immediately put an end to the war; otherwise he
intended to raise the siege, and no longer harrass and lessen the
troops by fighting battles never decisive, nor quite ex∣haust the city of
Athens, by employing its trea∣sures in needless expences.</P>
<P>Nicias, terrified by this bold and precipitate resolution of
Demosthenes, conjured him not to be so hasty, but to take time to weigh
things deliberately, that he might have no cause to repent of what he
should do. He observed to him, that the enemy would be ruined by de∣lays;
that their provisions as well as money were entirely exhausted; that their
allies were going to abandon them; that they must soon be reduced to such
extremity for want of pro∣visions, as would force them to surrender, as
they had before resolved. For there were cer∣tain persons in Syracuse who
held a secret cor∣respondence with Nicias, and exhorted him not to be
impatient, because the Syracusans <PB N="282" REF="285"/> were tired with
the war and with Gylippus; and that should the necessity to which they
were reduced be ever so little increased, they would surrender at
discretion.</P>
<P>As Nicias did not explain himself clearly, and would not declare
in express terms that sure and certain advices were sent him of what∣ever
was transacted in the city, his remon∣strances were considered as an
effect of the ti∣midity and slowness with which he had always been
reproached. Such, said they, are his usual protractions, delays,
distrusts, and fearful precaution, whereby he has deadened all the
vivacity, and extinguished all the ardour of the troops, in not marching them
immediately against the enemy; but, on the contrary, by deferring to attack
them till his own forces were weakened and despised. This made the rest
of the generals, and all the officers, come over to Demosthenes's opinion,
and Nicias himself was at last forced to acquiesce in it.</P>
<P>Demosthenes, after having attacked to no purpose the wall which
cut the contravallation of the besiegers, confined himself to the attack of
Epipolae, from a supposition, that should he once be master of it, the
wall would be quite undefended. He, therefore, took pro∣visions 
<PB N="283" REF="286"/> for five days, with workmen, imple∣ments, and every
thing necessary for him to defend that post after he should
possess himself of it. As there was no going up to it in the day-time
undiscovered, he marched thither in the night with all his forces, followed
by Eury∣medon and Menander; Nicias staying behind to guard the camp. They
went up by the way of Euryelus, as before, unperceived by the centinels,
attacked the first intrenchment, and stormed it, after killing part of
those who de∣fended it. Demosthenes, not satisfied with this advantage,
to prevent the ardour of his soldiers from cooling, and not delay the
execution of his design, marches forward. During this in∣terval, the forces
of the city, sustained by Gy∣lippus, marched under arms out of the
in∣trenchments. Being seized with astonishment, which the darkness of
the night increased, they were immediately repulsed and put to flight. But,
as the Athenians advanced in disorder, to force whatever might resist
their arms, lest the enemy might rally again, should time be allowed them
to breathe and recover from their surprize, they are stopped on a sud∣den
by the Boeotians, who make a vigorous stand, and marching against the
Athenians with their pikes presented, they repulse them 
<PB N="284" REF="287"/> with great shouts, and make a dreadful slaugh∣ter.
This spreads an universal terror through the rest of the army. Those
who fled, either force along such as were advancing to their
as∣sistance, or else mistaking them for enemies, turn their arms
against them. They now were all mixed indiscriminately, it being
impossible to discover objects in the horrors of a night, which was not
so gloomy as entirely to make objects imperceptible, nor yet light enough to
distinguish those which were seen. The Athe∣nians sought for one
another to no purpose, and from their often asking the word, by which only
they were able to know one an∣other, a strange confusion of sounds was
heard, which occasion no little disorder, not to men∣tion that they by this
means divulged the word to the enemy, and could not learn theirs; be∣cause,
by their being together, and in a body, they had no occasion to repeat it. In
the mean time, those who were pursued threw themselves from the top of
the rocks, and many were dashed to pieces by the fall; and as most of
those who escaped straggled from one another up and down the fields and
woods, they were cut to pieces the next day by the enemy's horse who
pursued them. Two thou∣sand Athenians were slain in this engagement, 
<PB N="285" REF="288"/> and a great number of arms were taken, those who fled
having thrown them away, that they might be the better able to escape over
the precipices. Soon after Gylippus having made the tour of Sicily, brought a
great number of troops with him, which rendered the affairs of Athens still
more desperate, and deprived Nicias of all hopes of success; besides,
the Athenian army now began to diminish exceed∣ingly by sickness, and
nothing seen to remain but their quitting an island in which they had
experienced every mortification. Nicias no longer opposed the resolution,
and only desired to have it kept secret. Orders were, there∣fore, given as
privately as possible, for the fleet to prepare for setting sail with
the utmost expedition.</P>
<P>When all things were ready, the moment they were going to set
sail, (wholly unsuspect∣ed by the enemy, who were far from surmising
they would leave Sicily so soon) the moon was suddenly eclipsed in the
middle of the night, and lost all its splendour, which terrified Ni∣cias
and the whole army, who from ignorance and superstition, were
astonished at so sudden a change, the causes of which they did not
know, and therefore dreaded the consequences of it. They then consulted the
soothsayers, <PB N="286" REF="289"/> who being equally unacquainted with the
rea∣sons of this phaemonenon, only augmented their consternation. It was
the custom, after such accidents had happened, to suspend their
enterprize but for three days. The soothsayers pronounced, that he must
not set sail till three times nine days were past, (these were
Thucy∣dides' words) which doubtless was a mysterious number in the opinion
of the people. Nicias, scrupulous to a fault, and full of a mistaken
veneration for these blind interpreters of the will of the gods, declared
that he would wait a whole revolution of the moon, and not re∣turn till the
same day of the next month, as if he had not seen the planet very clearly,
the instant it had emerged from that part which was darkened by the
interposition of the earth's body.</P>
<P>But he was not allowed time for this. The news of the intended
departure of the Atheni∣ans soon spread over the city; a resolution was
taken to attack the besiegers both by sea and land. The Syracusans began
the first day by attacking the intrenchments, and gained a slight advantage
over the enemy. On the mor∣row they made a second attack, and, at the same
time, sailed with seventy-six gallies against eighty-six of the
Athenian. Eumyredon, who <PB N="287" REF="290"/> commanded the right of the
Athenian fleet, hav∣ing spread along the shore to surround them, this
movement proved fatal to him; for, as he was detached from the body of the
fleet, the Syracusans, after forcing the main battle, which was in the
center, attacked him, drove him vi∣gorously into the gulf called Dascon,
and there defeated him entirely. Eumyredon lost his life in the engagement.
They afterwards gave chace to the rest of the gallies, and run them against
the shore. Gylippus, who com∣manded the land army, seeing the Athenian
gallies were forced a-ground, and not able to return into the staccado,
landed with part of his troops, in order to charge the soldiers, in case
they should be forced to run ashore, and give his friends the more room to
tow such gallies as they should have taken; however, he was repulsed by
the Tyrrhenians, who were posted on that side, and obliged by the
Athe∣nians, who flew to sustain them, to retire with some loss as far
as a moor which lay near it. The latter saved most of their ships,
eighteen excepted, which were taken by the Syracusans, and their crews cut to
pieces by them. After this, resolving to burn the rest, they filled an old
vessel with combustible materials, and hav∣ing set fire to it, they
drove it by the help of <PB N="288" REF="291"/> the wind against the
Athenians, who neverthe∣less extinguished the fire, and drove off that
ship; each side erected trophies, the Syracu∣sans for the death of
Eurymedon, and the ad∣vantage they had gained the day before, and the Athenians
for their having driven part of the enemy into the moor, and put the other part
to flight. But the minds of the two na∣tions were very differently
disposed; the Syra∣cusans, who had been thrown into the utmost
consternation at the arrival of Demosthenes with his fleet, seeing
themselves victorious in a naval engagement, resumed fresh hope, and
assured themselves of a complete victory over their enemies. The
Athenians, on the con∣trary, frustrated of their only resource, and
overcome at sea, so contrary to their expecta∣tions, entirely lost
courage, and had no thoughts but of retiring.</P>
<P>The enemy, to deprive them of all resource, and prevent their
escaping, shut the mouth of the great harbour, which was about five
hun∣dred paces wide, with gallies placed cross-wise, and other vessels
fixed with anchors and iron chains, and, at the same time, made the
requi∣site preparations for a battle, in case they should have courage to
engage again. When the Athenians saw themselves thus hemmed in, 
<PB N="289" REF="292"/> the generals and principal officers assembled, in
order to deliberate on the present state of affairs. They were in
absolute want of provisions, which was owing to their having forbid the
people of Catana to bring any, from the hopes they en∣tertained of their being
able to retire, and they could not procure any from other places unless they
were masters of the sea; this made them resolve to venture a sea fight.
In this view they were determined to leave their old camp and their walls, and
to entrench themselves on the shore near their ships, in the smallest
compass possible; their design was to leave some forces in that place
to guard their baggage and the sick, and to fight with the rest aboard all
the ships they should have saved. They intended to retire into Catana in
case they should be victorious, otherwise to set fire to their ships,
and to march by land to the nearest city be∣longing to their allies.</P>
<P>This resolution being taken, Nicias imme∣diately filled an hundred
and ten gallies (the others having lost their oars) with the flower of his
infantry, and drew up the rest of the forces, particularly the bowmen, in
order of battle on the shore. As the Athenians dread∣ed very much the beaks
of the Syracusan gal∣lies, Nicias had provided harping-irons to 
<PB N="290" REF="293"/> grapple them, in order to break the force of the blow,
and to come immediately to close fight as on shore. But the enemy
perceiving this, covered the prows and upper part of their gallies with
leather, to prevent their being so easily laid hold of. The commanders on
both sides had employed all their rhetoric to animate their men, and none
could ever have been prompted with stronger motives, for the battle which was
going to be fought was to deter∣mine not only their lives and liberties, but
also the fate of their country.</P>
<P>This battle was very obstinate and bloody. The Athenians being
arrived at the mouth of the port, easily took those ships which defend∣ed
the entrance of it, but when they attempted to break the chain of the rest to
widen the passage, the enemy came up from all quarters. As near two hundred
gallies came rushing on each side in a narrow place, there must
neces∣sarily be a very great confusion, and the vessels could not
easily advance forward, or retire, or turn about to renew the attack. The
beaks of the gallies for this reason did very little execu∣tion, but there
were very furious and frequent discharges. The Athenians were overwhelm∣ed
with a shower of stones, which always did execution from what place
soever they were <PB N="291" REF="294"/> thrown, whereas they defended
themselves by only shooting darts and arrows, which by the motion of the
ships, from the agitation of the sea, did not carry true, and by that means
the greatest part of them did little execution. Aris∣ton, the pilot, had
given the Syracusans this counsel. These discharges being over, the
soldiers heavily armed attempted to enter the enemies ships, in order to
fight hand to hand, and it often happened that whilst they were climbing up
one side, their own ships were en∣tered on the other, and two or three
ships were grappled to one, which occasioned a great perplexity and
confusion. Farther, the noise of the ships that dashed one against
the other, the different cries of the victors and vanquished, prevented the
orders of the offi∣cers from being heard. The Athenians want∣ed to force a
passage, whatever might be the consequence, to secure their return into
their own country, and this the enemy employed their utmost efforts to
prevent, in order that they might gain a more complete and more glorious
victory. The two land-armies, which were drawn up on the highest part of the
shore, and the inhabitants of the city who were there,
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an to the walls, whilst the
rest kneeling in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he temples were
imploring heaven to give <PB N="292" REF="295"/> success to their
fellow-citizens, all these saw clear, because of their little distance
from the fleets every thing that passed, and contemplated the battle as
from an amphitheatre, but not with∣out great anxiety and terror. Attentive to,
and shuddering at every movement, and the se∣veral changes which happened,
they discovered the concern they had in the battle, their fears, their hopes,
their grief, their joy, by different cries and different gestures,
stretching out their hands sometimes towards the combatants to animate
them, at other times towards hea∣ven, to implore the succour and protection
of the gods. At last the Athenian fleet, after sustaining a long battle,
and a vigorous re∣sistance, was put to flight, and drove against the
shore. The Syracusans, who were specta∣tors of this victory, conveyed the
news to the whole city by an universal shout. The victors, now masters of
the sea, and sailing with a favourable wind towards Syracuse, erected a
trophy, whilst the Athenians, who were quite dejected and overpowered, did
not so much as request that their dead soldiers might be de∣livered to
them, in order to pay the last sad duty to their remains.</P>
<P>There now remained but two methods for them to chuse, either to
attempt the passage <PB N="293" REF="296"/> a second time, for which they
had ships and soldiers sufficient, or to abandon their fleet to the enemy
and retire by land. Demosthenes proposed the former, but the sailors, in
the deepest affliction, refused to obey, fully per∣suaded that it would
be impossible for them to sustain a second engagement. The second
me∣thod was, therefore, resolved upon, and ac∣cordingly they prepared to
set out in the night, to conceal the march of their army from the enemy.</P>
<P>But Hermocrates, who suspected their de∣sign, was very
sensible that it was of the ut∣most importance not to suffer so great
a body of forces to escape, since they otherwise might sortify
themselves in some corner of the island, and renew the war. The
Syracusans were at that time in the midst of their festivity and
re∣joicings, and meditating nothing but how they might divert themselves
after the toils they had sustained in fight. They were then solem∣nizing
the festival of Hercules. To desire the Syracusans to take up arms again
in order to pursue the enemy, and to attempt to draw them from their
diversions, either by force or persuasion, would have been to no
purpose, for which reason, another expedient was employ∣ed. Hermocrates
sent out a few horsemen, <PB N="294" REF="297"/> who were to pass for
friends of the Athenians, and ordered them to cry aloud, Tell Nicias not to
retire till day light, for the Syracusans lye in ambush for him, and have
seized on their passes. This false advice stopped Nicias at once, and
he did not even set out the next day, in order that the soldiers might have
more time to prepare for their departure, and carry off whatever might be
necessary for their subsistence, and abandon the rest.</P>
<P>The enemy had time enough for seizing the avenues. The next
morning early they pos∣sessed themselves of the most difficult
passes, fortified those places where the rivers were fordable, broke down
the bridges, and spread detachments of horse up and down the plain, so
that there was not one place which the Athenians could pass without fighting.
They set out upon their march the third day after the battle, with design
to retire to Catana. The whole army was in an inexpressible
con∣sternation, to see such a great number of men either dead, or dying,
some of whom were left exposed to wild beasts, and the rest to the
cruelty of the enemy. Those who were sick and wounded conjured them with
tears, to take them along with the army, and held by their cloaths when they
were going, or else crawl∣ing <PB N="295" REF="298"/> after them, followed
them as far as their strength would permit; and, when this failed, had
recourse to tears, sighs, im∣precations, and sending up toward heaven
plaintive and dying groans; they called upon the gods, as well as men, to
avenge their cruelty, whilst every place echoed with la∣mentations.</P>
<P>The whole army was in a deplorable condi∣tion. All the Athenians
were seized with the deepest melancholy. They were inwardly tortur∣ed with
rage and anguish, when they represented to themselves the greatness
from which they were fallen, the extreme misery to which they were reduced,
and the still greater evils from which they foresaw it would be
impossible for them to escape. They could not bear the comparison for
ever present in their thoughts, of the triumphant state in which they had
left Athens, in the midst of the good wishes and acclamations of the
people, with the ignominy of their retreat, aggravated by the cries and
imprecations of their relations and fellow-citizens.</P>
<P>But the most melancholy part of the specta∣cle, and that which
most deserved compassion, was Nicias, dejected and worn out by a
tedious illness, deprived of the most necessary stores 
<PB N="296" REF="299"/> at a time when his age and infirmities required them
most, pierced not only with his private grief, but with that of others, all
which preyed upon his heart. However, this great man, supe∣rior to all his
evils, thought of nothing but how he might best comfort his soldiers, and
revive their courage. He ran up and down in all places, crying aloud, that
their situation was not yet desperate, and that other armies had escap∣ed
from greater dangers; that they ought not to accuse themselves, or grieve
too immode∣rately for misfortunes which they had not oc∣casioned; that if
they had offended some god, his vengeance must be satiated by this time;
that fortune, after having so long favoured the enemy, would at last be
tired of persecuting them; that their bravery and their numbers made them
still formidable, (being still near forty thousand strong) that no city
in Sicily would be able to withstand them, nor prevent their settling
wherever they might think pro∣per; that they had no more to do but to take care
severally of themselves, and march in good order; that by a prudent and
courageous retreat, which was now become their only re∣source, they would not
only save themselves, but also their country, and enable it to recover
its former grandeur.</P>
<P><PB N="297" REF="300"/> The army marched in two bodies, both drawn up
in the form of a phalanx, the first being commanded by Nicias, and the
second by Demosthenes, with the baggage in the cen∣ter. Being come to the
river Anapis, they forced their passage, and afterwards were charg∣ed by
all the enemy's cavalry, as well as archers, who discharged perpetually upon
them. They were annoyed in this manner during several days march, every one
of the passes being guarded, and the Athenians being obliged to dispute
every inch of their way. The enemy did not care to hazard a battle against an
army which despair alone might render invincible; and the instant the
Athenians presented the Syracusans battle, the latter retired; but
when∣ever the former proceeded in their march, they advanced and charged them
in their re∣treat.</P>
<P>Demosthenes and Nicias seeing the miserable condition to which
the troops were reduced, being in extreme want of provisions, and great
numbers of them wounded, judged it advise∣able to retire towards the sea by
a quite con∣trary way from that in which they then march∣ed, and to make
directly for Camarina and Gela, instead of proceeding to Catana as they
first intended. They set out in the night after <PB N="298" REF="301"/>
lighting a great number of fires. The retreat was made in great confusion and
disorder, as generally happens to great armies in the gloomy horrors of the
night, especially when the ene∣my is not far off. However, the van-guard
commanded by Nicias, went forward in good order, but above half the rear-guard,
with Demosthenes at their head, quitted from the main body, and lost their
way. On the next day the Syracusans, who on the report of their retreat, had
marched with the utmost dili∣gence, came up with him about noon, and having
surrounded him with their horse, drove him into a narrow place inclosed
with a wall, where his soldiers fought like lions. Perceiving at the close
of the day that they were oppressed with fatigue, and covered with wounds,
the con∣quering Syracusans gave the islanders leave to retire, which some
of them accepted, and they afterwards spared the lives of the rest who
sur∣rendered at discretion, with Demosthenes, after having stipulated
that they should not be put to death, nor sentenced to perpetual
imprison∣ment. About six thousand soldiers surrender∣ed on these
conditions.</P>
<P>Nicias arrived the same evening at the river Erineus, and
passing it, encamped on a moun∣tain, where the enemy came up with him the 
<PB N="299" REF="302"/> next day, and summoned him to surrender at
dis∣cretion as Demosthenes had done. Nicias could not persuade himself
at first that what they told him concerning Demosthenes was true; and,
therefore, desired leave to send some horse for information. Upon their
returning with the news that Demosthenes had really surrendered in that
manner, Nicias offered to pay the ex∣pences of the war, upon condition they
would permit him to leave the country with his forces, and to give as many
Athenians for hostages as they should be obliged to pay ta∣lents. But the
enemy rejected this proposal with disdain and insolence, and renewed the
attack. Nicias, though in absolute want of all things, however sustained
the charge the whole night, and marched towards the river Asinarus. When they
were got to the banks of it, the Syracusans advancing up to them, threw
most of them into the stream, the rest already having plunged voluntarily
into it to quench their thirst. Here the greatest and most bloody havock
was made, the poor wretches being butchered without the least pity as they
were drinking. Nicias finding all lost, and unable to bear this dismal
spectacle, surrendered at discretion, upon condition that Gylippus
should discontinue the fight, and <PB N="300" REF="303"/> spare the rest
of his army. A great number were killed, and more taken prisoners, so that
all Sicily was filled with them. The Atheni∣ans seemed to have been
displeased with their general for surrendering in this manner at
dis∣cretion; and, for this reason, his name was omitted in a public
monument, on which was engraved the names of those commanders who had lost
their lives in fighting for their country.</P>
<P>The victors, adorned with the arms taken from the prisoners, the
finest and largest trees they could find on the banks of the rivers, and
made a kind of trophies of those trees, when crowning themselves with
chaplets of flowers, dressing their horses in the richest caparisons,
and cropping those of their enemies, they en∣tered triumphantly into
Syracuse, after having happily terminated the most considerable war in
which they had ever been engaged with the Greeks, and won by their strength
and valour a most signal and most complete victory.</P>
<P>The next day a council was held to delibe∣rate on what was to be
done with the prisoners. Diocles, one of the leaders of greatest authority
among the people, proposed that all the Athe∣nians who were born of free
parents, and all such Sicilians as had joined with them, should be
imprisoned, and only two measures of flour <PB N="301" REF="304"/> and one
of water given them daily; that the slaves and all the allies should be
publicly sold, and that the two Athenian generals should be first
scourged with rods, and afterwards put to death.</P>
<P>This last article was exceedingly disliked by all wise and
compassionate Syracusans. Her∣mocrates, who was very famous for his
probi∣ty and justice, attempted to make some remon∣strances to the
people, but they would not hear him, and the shouts which echoed on all
sides prevented him from continuing his speech. At that instant an
ancient man, vene∣rable for his great age and gravity, who in this war had
lost two sons, the only heirs to his name and estate, made his servants
carry him to the tribunal for harrangues, and the instant he appeared a
profound silence was made. 
<Q REND="inline">"You here behold, says he, an un∣fortunate father
who has felt more than any other Syracusan the fatal effects of this war, by
the death of two sons who formed all the con∣solation, and were the only
supports of my old age. I cannot, indeed, forbear admiring their courage and
felicity, in sacrificing to their country's welfare a life of which they
would one day have been deprived by the common course of nature: but then I
cannot but be <PB N="302" REF="305"/> strongly affected with the cruel wound
which their death has made in my heart, nor forbear hating and detesting the
Athenians, the au∣thors of this unhappy war, as the murtherers of my children;
but, however, I cannot con∣ceal one circumstance, which is, that I am less
sensible of my private affliction than of the ho∣nour of my country, and I
see it exposed to eternal infamy by the barbarous advice which is now given
you. The Athenians indeed me∣rit the worst treatment, and every kind of
punishment that can be inflicted on them for so unjustly declaring war
against us, but have not the gods, the just avengers of crimes, punished
them, and revenged us sufficiently. When their general laid down his arms and
surrendered, did he not do this in the hopes of having their lives spared,
and if we put them to death, will it be possible for us to avoid the just
reproach of our having violated the laws of nations, and dishonoured our
vic∣tory by an unheard-of cruelty? How will you suffer your glory to be thus
sullied in the face of the whole world, and have it said, that a nation who
first dedicated a temple in this city to Clemency had not found any in yours?
Surely victories and triumphs do not give im∣mortal glory to a city; but the
exercising <PB N="303" REF="306"/> mercy towards a vanquished enemy, the
using moderation in the greatest prosperity, and fear∣ing to offend the
gods by a haughty and insolent pride, will ever insure it. You doubtless
have not forgot that this Nicias, whose fate you are going to pronounce, was
the very man who pleaded your cause in the assembly of the Athenians, and
employed all his credit, and the whole power of his eloquence to dissuade
his country from embarking in this war; should you, therefore, pronounce
sentence of death on this worthy general, would it be a just reward for the
zeal he showed for your interest? With regard to myself, death would be
less grievous to me than the sight of so horrid an injustice committed
by my countrymen and fellow-citizens."</Q></P>
<P>The people seemed moved with compassion at this speech,
especially when this venerable old man first ascended, they expected to
hear him cry aloud for vengeance on those who had brought all his calamities
upon him, instead of suing for their pardon. But the enemies of the
Athenians having expatiated with vehe∣mence on the unheard of cruelties which
their republic had exercised on several cities belong∣ing to their enemies,
and even to their ancient allies; the inveteracy which the commanders had
shewn against Syracuse, and the evils they <PB N="304" REF="307"/> would
have made it suffer had they been vic∣torious, the afflictions and groans of
infinite numbers of Syracusans who bewailed the death of their children and
near relations, whose manes could be appeased no other way than by the
blood of their murderers. These representa∣tions prevailed, and the people
returned to their sanguinary resolution, and followed Diocles's advice in
every respect. Gylippus used his utmost endeavours, but in vain, to have
Nicias and Demosthenes given up to him, (especially as he had taken them)
in order for him to carry them to Lacedaemon; but his demand was re∣jected with
a haughty scorn, and the two ge∣nerals were put to death.</P>
<P>All wise and compassionate men could not forbear shedding
tears at the tragical fate of two such illustrious personages, and
particular∣ly for Nicias, who, of all men of his time, seemed least to
merit so ignominious and un∣timely an end. When people recollect the
speeches and remonstrances he had made to prevent this war; and, on the
other side, when they considered how high a regard he had al∣ways retained
for things relating to religion, the greatest part of them were tempted to
ex∣claim against providence, in seeing that a man, who had ever shown the
highest reverence for <PB N="305" REF="308"/> the gods, and had always exerted
himself to the utmost for their honour and worship, should be so ill
rewarded by them, and meet with no better fate than the most abandoned
wretches.</P>
<P>The prisoners were shut up in the pri∣sons of Syracuse,
where, crouded one upon the other, they suffered incredible torment for eight
months. Here they were for ever ex∣posed to the inclemencies of the weather,
scorched in the day-time by the burning rays of the sun, or frozen in the
night by the colds of autumn; poisoned by the stench of their own
excrement, by the carcasses of those who died of their wounds and of
sickness, and worn out by hunger and thirst, for the daily allowance to
each was but a small measure of water and two of meal. Those who were
taken out of this place two months after, in order to be sold as slaves,
many of whom were citizens who had concealed their condition, found a less
rigorous fate. Their wisdom, their patience, and a certain air of probity and
modesty were of great advantage to them, for they were soon restored to
their liberty, or met with the kindest and most generous treat∣ment from
their masters. Several of them even owed the good usage they met with to 
<PB N="306" REF="309"/> Eurypides, the finest scenes of whose tragedies
they repeated to the Sicilians, who were ex∣tremely fond of them; so that
when they re∣turned to their own country, they went and sa∣luted that poet as
their deliverer, and inform∣ed him of the admirable effects wrought in their
favour by his verses.</P>
<P>The news of the defeat being carried to Athens, the citizens would
not believe it at first, and were so far from giving credit to the report,
that they sentenced that man to death who first published the tidings;
but when it was confirm∣ed, all the Athenians were seized with the utmost
consternation; and, as if themselves had not decreed the war, they vented
their rage and re∣sentment against the orators who had pro∣moted the
enterprize, as well as against the soothsayers, who by their supposed
prodigies, had flattered them with the hopes of success. They had never
been reduced to so deplorable a condition as now, having neither horse,
foot, money, gallies, nor mariners; in a word, they were in the deepest
despair, expecting every moment that the enemy, elate with so great a
victory, and strengthened by the revolt of the allies, would come and invade
Athens both by sea and land with all the forces of Pe∣loponnesus. 
<PB N="307" REF="310"/> Cicero had reason to observe, speaking of the
battles in the harbour of Syra∣cuse, that it was there the troops of Athens,
as well as their gallies, were ruined and sunk, and that in this harbour the
power and glory of the Athenians were miserably shipwrecked.</P>
<P>The Athenians, however, did not suffer themselves to be wholly
dejected, but resum∣ed courage. They now resolved to raise money on all
sides, and to import timber for building ships, in order to awe the allies,
and parti∣cularly the inhabitants of the island of Euboea. They retrenched
all superfluous expences, and established a new council of ancient men
who were to weigh and examine all affairs before they should be proposed to
the people. In fine, they omitted nothing which might be of service in the
present conjuncture, the alarm in which they were in, and their common
dan∣ger, obliging every individual to be attentive to the necessities of
the state, and sedulous to all advice that might promote its
interests.</P>
<P>Such was the event of the siege of Syracuse, the failure of
which destroyed the power of those that had undertaken it. We have
hither∣to seen Athens rising in arts and arms, giving lessons both in
politeness, humanity, philo∣sophy, <PB N="306" REF="311"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/> <PB N="307" REF="312"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/> <PB N="308" REF="313"/> and war,
to all the nations round, and beginning to fix an empire, which, if once
established, no neighbouring power could over∣throw. But their ambition
grew faster than their abilities, and their views extending be∣yond their
capacity to execute, they fell at once from that height to which for ages they
had been assiduously aspiring. We are now, therefore, to be presented
with a different picture, we are no longer to view this little state panting
for conquests over other nations, but timorously defending itself at
home; we are no longer to view Athens taking the lead in the councils, and
conducting the confe∣derated armies of Greece; they now become in a measure
annihilated, they fade from the eye of the historian; and other nations,
whose names have hitherto been scarcely mentioned, emerge from obscurity.
The rashness of this enterprize was severely punished in the loss of
their best generals, fleets, and armies; all now was destroyed, or left at
the mercy of those whom they had so unseasonably undertaken to
subdue.</P>
<P>Their allies began now to think of throw∣ing off their yoke; and
even those who had stood neuter took this occasion to declare 
<PB N="309" REF="314"/> against them. But the Lacedaemonians being more
particularly elevated, resolved to prose∣cute the war with vigour, and the
win∣ter was spent in preparations on both sides. The Athenians, in their
present distress, scarce knew where to turn; many of their allied
cities revolted, and it was with the ut∣most difficulty, that by placing
their forces and fleets at Samos, they reduced such states as had abandoned
them to their former obedi∣ence, and kept the rest in their duty: thus
still struggling with a part of their former spirit, they kept
themselves in a condition to make head against their enemies, over whom
they had obtained several advantages.</P>
<P>Alcibiades, who was well informed of all that passed among the
Athenians, sent secretly to the principal of them at Samos to sound their
senti∣ments, and to let them know that he was not averse to returning to
Athens, provided the administration of the republic were put into the hands
of the great and powerful, and not left to the populace, who had expelled him.
Some of the principal officers went from Samos with a design to concert with
him the proper measures for the success of that undertaking. He
promised to procure the Athenians not on∣ly <PB N="310" REF="315"/> the favour
of the king of Persia, with whom he had taken refuge, but of the king
himself, upon condition they would abolish the demo∣cracy, or popular
government; because the king would place more confidence in the en∣gagements
of the nobility than upon those of the inconstant and capricious multitude.
The chief man who opposed his return was Phryni∣cus, one of the generals,
who, to compass his designs, sent word to Astyochus, the Lacedae∣momian
general, that Alcibiades was treating with
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>issaphernes, to bring him over
to the Athenian interest. He offered farther, to be∣tray to him the whole
army and navy of the Athenians. But his treasonable practices being all
detected by the good understanding betwixt Alcibiades and Astyochus, he was
laid aside, and afterwards stabbed in the market-place.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the Athenians went eagerly forward to complete
that change of go∣vernment which had been proposed to them by Alcibiades; the
democracy began to be abolish∣ed in several cities of Athens, and soon
after the scheme was carried boldly forward by Pysander, who was chiefly
concerned in this transaction. To give a new form to this government, he 
<PB N="311" REF="316"/> caused ten commissaries, with absolute power, to
be appointed, who were, however, at a cer∣tain fixed time, to give the people
an account of what they had done. At the expiration of that term, the general
assembly was summon∣ed, wherein their first resolution was, that
every one should be admitted to make such proposals as he thought fit,
without being liable to any accusation for infringing the law, or
consequential penalty. It was afterwards decreed, that a new council should
be formed, with full power to administer the public af∣fairs, and to elect
new magistrates. For this purpose, five presidents were established,
who nominated one hundred persons, including themselves. Each of these
chose and associated three more at his own pleasure, which made in all
four hundred, in whom an absolute power was lodged. But to amuse the
people, and to console them with a shadow of popular govern∣ment, whilst
they instituted a real oligarchy, it was said that the four hundred
should call a council of five thousand citizens to assist them when
they should judge it necessary. The council and assemblies of the
people were held as usual, nothing was done, however, but by order of the
four hundred. The people of <PB N="312" REF="317"/> Athens were deprived in this
manner of their liberty, which they had enjoyed almost an hun∣dred years,
after having abolished the tyranny of the Pisistratides.</P>
<P>This decree being passed without opposition, after the
separation of the assembly the four hundred, armed with daggers, and
attended by an hundred and twenty young men, whom they made use of when any
execution required it, entered the senate, and compelled the senators to
retire, after having paid them the arrears due upon their appointments. They
elected new magistrates out of their own body, ob∣serving the usual
ceremonies upon such occa∣sions. They did not think proper to recall
those who were banished, lest they should au∣thorize the return of
Alcibiades, whose uncon∣troulable spirit they apprehended, and who would
soon have made himself master of the people. Abusing their power in a
tyrannical manner, they put some to death, others they banished, and
confiscated their estates with im∣punity. All who ventured to oppose this
change, or even to complain of it, were butchered up∣on false pretexts, and
those were intimidated who demanded justice of the murderers. The four
hundred, soon after their establishment, <PB N="313" REF="318"/> sent
ten deputies to Samos for the army's con∣currence to their
establishment.</P>
<P>The army, in the mean time, which was at Samos, protested
against those proceedings in the city; and, at the persuasion of
Thrasybulus, recalled Alcibiades, and created him general, with full power to
sail directly to the Pyraeus and crush this new tyranny. Alcibiades,
however, would not give way to this rash opinion, but went first to shew
himself to Tissaphernes, and let him know, that it was now in his power
to treat him as a friend or an enemy. By which means he awed the Athenians with
Tissa∣phernes, and Tissaphernes with the Atheni∣ans. When, afterwards,
the four hundred sent to Samos to vindicate their proceedings, the army was
for putting the messengers to death, and persisted in the design upon
the Pyraeus, but Alcibiades, by opposing it, mani∣festly saved the
commonwealth.</P>
<P>In the mean while, the innovation in Athens had occasioned such
factions and tumults, that the four hundred were more intent upon pro∣viding
for their safety than prosecuting the war. In order to which, they
fortisied that part of the Pyraeus which commands the mouth of the haven, and
resolved, in case of extremi∣ty, <PB N="314" REF="319"/> rather to let in
the Lacedaemonians than expose their persons to the fury of their
fellow-citizens. The Spartans took occasion from these disturbances, to
hover about with forty-two gallies under the conduct of Hegesandri∣des; and
the Athenians, with thirty-six under Timochares, were forced to engage them,
but lost part of their fleet, and the rest were dis∣persed. To add to
which, all Euboea, except Oreus, revolted to the Peloponnesians.</P>
<P>This failure of success served to give the finishing blow to
the power of the four hun∣dred. The Athenians without delay depos∣ed them as
the authors of all their troubles and divisions under which they groaned.
Al∣cibiades was recalled by unanimous consent, and earnestly sollicited
to make all possible haste to the assistance of the city. But
judging that if he returned immediately to Athens, he should owe his recall
to the compassion and favour of the people, he resolved to render his
return glorious and triumphant, and to de∣serve it by some considerable
exploit. For this purpose, leaving Samos with a small number of ships, he
cruised about the island of Cos and Cnidos, and having learnt that
Mindarus, the Spartan admiral, was sailed to the Helles∣pont 
<PB N="315" REF="320"/> with his whole fleet, and that the Athe∣nians were in
pursuit of him, he steered that way with the utmost diligence to
support them, and arrived happily with his eighteen vessels at the time
the fleets were engaged near Aby∣dos, in a battle which lasted till night,
with∣out any advantage on either side. His arrival gave the Spartans new
courage at first, who believed him still their friend, and dispirited the
Athenians. But Alcibiades hanging out the Athenian flag in the admiral's
galley, fell upon them and put them to flight; and ani∣mated by his
success, sunk their vessels, and made a great slaughter of their
soldiers who had thrown themselves into the sea to save them∣selves
by swimming. The Athenians, after having taken thirty of their gallies, and
retaken those they had lost, erected a trophy.</P>
<P>Alcibiades after this victory went to visit Tissaphernes, who
was so far from receiving him as he expected, that he immediately caus∣ed
him to be seized, and sent away prisoner to Sardis, telling him he had
orders from the king to make war upon the Athenians; but the truth is, he was
afraid of being accused to his master by the Peloponnesians, and thought,
by this act of injustice, to purge himself from <PB N="316" REF="321"/> all
former imputations. Alcibiades, after thirty days, made his escape to
Clazomenae, and soon after bore down upon the Pelopon∣nesian fleet, which
rode at anchor before the port of Cyzicus. With twenty of his best ships he
broke through the enemy, pursued those who abandoned their ships and fled
to land, and made a great slaughter. The Athe∣nians took all the enemies
ships, made them∣selves masters of Cyzicus, while Mingimis, the
Lacedaemonian general, was found among the number of the slain.</P>
<P>Alcibiades well knew how to make use of the victory he had gained;
and, at the head of his conquering forces, took several cities which had
revolted from the Athenians. Calcedon, Salymbria, and Byzantium, were among the
number. Thus slushed with conquest, he seemed to desire nothing so
ardently as to be once more seen by his countrymen, as his presence would
be a triumph to his friends, and an in∣sult to his enemies. Accordingly,
being re∣called, he set sail for Athens. Besides the ships covered with
bucklers and spoils of all sorts in the manner of trophies, a great number
of vessels also were towed after him by way of triumph; he displayed
also the ensigns and <PB N="317" REF="322"/> ornaments of those he had
burnt, which were more than the others, the whole amounting to about two
hundred ships. It is said, that reflecting on what had been done against
him, upon approaching the port, he was struck with some terror, and was
afraid to quit his vessel till he saw from the deck a great num∣ber of
his friends and relations who were come to the shore to receive him, and
earnestly en∣treated him to land. As soon as he was landed, the multitude
who came out to meet him, fixed their eyes on him, thronged about him,
saluted him with loud acclamations, and crowned him with garlands; he
received their congratulations with great satisfaction; he de∣sired to be
discharged from his former condem∣nation, and obtained from the priests an
ab∣solution from all their former denunciations.</P>
<P>Yet, notwithstanding these triumphs, the real power of Athens
was now no more, the strength of the state was gone, and even the
passion for liberty was lost in the common de∣generacy of the times; many
of the meaner sort of people passionately desired that Alcibiades would
take the sovereignty upon him, they even desired him to set himself
above the reach of envy, by securing all power in his own 
<PB N="318" REF="323"/> person; the great, however, were not so san∣guine
in their gratitude, they were content with appointing him generalissimo of
all their forces; they granted him whatever he demand∣ed, and gave him for
colleagues the generals most agreeable to him. He set sail according∣ly,
with an hundred ships, and steered for the island of Andros that had
revolted, where, having defeated the inhabitants, he went from thence to Samos,
intending to make that the seat of the war. In the mean time, the
Lace∣daemonians, justly alarmed at his success, made choice of a general
supposed to be cap∣able of making head against him; for this reason,
they fixed upon Lysander, who, though born of the highest family, had been
bred up to hardships, and paid an entire re∣spect to the discipline and
manners of his country. He was brave and aspiring, and, like his countrymen,
sacrificed all sorts of pleasure to his ambition. He had an evenness
and sedateness of temper which made all condi∣tions of life sit easy
upon him, but withal was extremely insinuating, crafty, and designing, and
made his interest the only measure of truth and falshood. This deceitful
temper was ob∣served to run through the whole course of his 
<PB N="319" REF="324"/> life; upon which occasion it was said, that he
cheated children with foul play, and men with perjury: and it was a maxim of
his own, that when the lion fails we must make use of the fox.</P>
<P>Lysander having brought his army to Ephe∣sus, gave orders for
assembling ships of bur∣den from all parts, and erected an arsenal for
building of gallies; he made the ports free for merchants, gave the public
places to artificers, put all arts in motion, and, by these means, filled the
city with riches, and laid the founda∣tion of that magnificence which he
afterwards obtained. Whilst he was making these dispo∣sitions, he
received advice that Cyrus, the Persian prince, was arrived at Sardis, he,
therefore, set out from Ephesus to make him a visit, and to complain of
Tissaphernes, whose duplicity and treachery had been fatal to their
common cause. Cyrus, who had a personal enmity to that general, came into
the views of Lysander, agreed to increase the seamens pay, and to give
him all the assistance in his power.</P>
<P>This largess filled the whole fleet with ardour and alacrity, and
almost unmanned the enemies gallies, the greatest part of the 
<PB N="320" REF="325"/> mariners deserting to the party where the pay was
best. The Athenians, in despair, upon receiving this news, endeavoured to
conciliate Cyrus by the interposition of Tissaphernes, but he would not
hearken to them, notwith∣standing the satrap represented, that it was not
for the king's interest to aggrandize the Lace∣daemonians, but to balance the
power of one side with that of the other, in order to per∣petuate the war,
and to ruin both by their own divsions.</P>
<P>Alcibiades, on the other hand, having oc∣casion to leave the
fleet, in order to raise the supplies, gave the command of his fleet to
An∣tiochus, with express command not to engage or attack the enemy in his
absence. Antiochus, however, was willing to do some action that might
procure him favour without a partner in the glory; he was so far, therefore,
from ob∣serving the orders that were given him, that he presently sailed
away for Ephesus; and, at the very mouth of the harbour, used every art to
provoke the enemy to an engagement. Ly∣sander at first manned out a few
ships to repel his insults; but as the Athenian ships advanced to
support Antiochus, other gallies belonging to the Lacedaemonians also came
on, till both <PB N="321" REF="326"/> fleets arrived by little and little, and
the en∣gagement became general on both sides. Ly∣sander at length was
victorious; Antiochus was slain, and fifteen Athenian gallies were taken. It
was in vain that Alcibiades soon after came up to the relief of his friends;
it was in vain that he offered to renew the com∣bat, Lysander, content with
the victory he had gained, was unwilling again to trust to for∣tune.</P>
<P>The fickle multitude of Athens again, therefore, began to accuse
Alcibiades of in∣sufficiency. He who was just before respected even to
adoration, was now discarded upon a groundless suspicion, that he had
not done his duty. But it was the glory he had obtained by his past
services that now ruined him; for his continual success had begot in the
people such an opinion of him, that they thought it impossible for him to
fail in any thing he un∣dertook, and from thence his enemies took oc∣casion
to question his integrity, and to impute to him both his own and other
miscarriages. Callicratidas was appointed to succeed Lysan∣der, whose
year was expired; alike severe to himself and others, inaccessible to
flattery and sloth, the declared enemy of luxury, he re∣tained the modesty,
temperance, and austerity <PB N="322" REF="327"/> of the ancient Spartans,
virtues that began to distinguish him particularly, as they were not too
common in his time. His probity and justice were proof against all things;
his sim∣plicity and integrity abhorred all falshood and fraud, to which
were joined a truly Spartan nobleness and grandeur of soul. The first
at∣tempt of the new admiral was against Me∣thymna, in Lesbos, which he took
by storm. He then threatened Conon, who was appoint∣ed general of the
Athenians, that he would make him leave <HI>debauching</HI> the sea, and
accord∣ingly soon after pursued him into the port of Mytilene with an
hundred and seventy sail, took thirty of his ships, and besieged him in
the town, from which he cut off all provisions. He soon after took ten
ships more out of twelve which were coming to his relief. Then hear∣ing that
the Athenians had fitted out their whole strength, consisting of an
hundred and fifty sail; he left fifty of his ships, under Etoni∣cus to
carry on the siege of Mytilene, and with an hundred and twenty more met the
Atheni∣ans at Arginusae, over against Lesbos. His pilot advised him to
retreat, for that the enemy was superior in number. He told him that Sparta
would be never the worse inhabited though he were slain. The fight was long
and obstinate, <PB N="323" REF="328"/> until at last the ships of
Callicratidas charg∣ng through the enemy was sunk, and the rest fled. The
Peloponnesians lost about seventy sail, and the Athenians twenty-five,
with most of the men in them. The Athenian admirals, who had the joint
command of the sleet, in∣stead of being rewarded for so signal a
victory, were made a barbarous instance of the power and ingratitude of their
fellow-citizens. Upon a relation of the fight before the senate, it was
alledged, they had suffered their men who were shipwrecked to be lost
when they might have saved them; upon which, they were clapped in irons in
order to answer it to the people. They urged in their defence, that they were
pursuing the enemy; and, at the same time, gave orders about taking up the
men to those whose business it more peculiarly was, particularly to
Theramenes, who was now their accuser; but yet, that their orders could not
be executed by reason of a violent storm which happened at that time. This
seemed so reasonable and satis∣factory, that several stood up and
offered to bail them: but, in another assembly, the po∣pular incendiaries
demanded justice, and so awed the judges, that Socrates was the only man
who had courage enough to declare, he would do nothing contrary to law, and
accord∣ingly <PB N="324" REF="329"/> refused to act. After a long debate,
eight of the ten were condemned, and six of them were put to death, among
whom was Pericles, son of the great Pericles. He declared, that they had
failed in nothing of their duty, as they had given orders that the dead bodies
should be taken up; that if any one were guilty, it was he, who being charged
with these orders, had neglected to put them in execution, but that he
accused nobody, and that the tempest which came on unexpectedly, at the
very instant, was an unanswerable apology, and entirely discharged the
accused from all guilt. He demanded that a whole day should be allowed them
to make their defence, a favour not denied to the most criminal, and that
they should be tried separately. He represented, that they were not in
the least obliged to pre∣cipitate a sentence wherein the lives of the
most Illustrious of the citizens were concerned; that it was in some
measure attacking the gods, to make men responsible for the winds and
weather; that they could not without the most flagrant ingratitude and
injustice put the con∣querors to death, to whom they ought to de∣cree crowns
and honours, or give up the de∣fenders of their country to the rage of those
who envied them; that if they did so, their <PB N="325" REF="330"/> unjust
judgment would be followed by a sud∣den, but vain repentance, which would
leave behind it the sharpest remorse, and cover them with eternal shame
and infamy; among the number also was Diomedon, a person equally eminent
for his valour and his probity, as he was carrying to execution, he demanded to
be heard. 
<Q REND="inline">"Athenians, said he, I wish the sen∣tence you
have passed upon us may not prove the misfortune of the republic; but I
have one favour to ask of you in behalf of my col∣leagues and myself, which
is to acquit us be∣fore the gods of the vows we made to them for you and
ourselves, as we are not in a condi∣tion to discharge them, for it is to
their pro∣tection invoked before the battle, we acknow∣ledge that we are
indebted for the victory gained by us over the enemy."</Q> There was not a good
citizen that did not melt into tears at this discourse, so full of
goodness and religion, and admire with surprize the moderation of a
person, who seeing himself unjustly condemned, did not however vent the
least resentment, or even complaint against his judges, but was solely
intent (in favour of an ungrateful coun∣try which had doomed them to perish)
upon what it owed to the gods in common with them for the victory they had
lately obtained.</P>
<P><PB N="326" REF="331"/> This complication of injustice and
ingrati∣tude seemed to give the finishing blow to the affairs of the
Athenian state; they struggled for a while after their defeat at
Syracuse, but from hence they were entirely sunk, though seemingly in the
arms of victory.</P>
<P>The enemy after their last defeat had once more recourse to
Lysander, who had so often led them to conquest; on him they placed their
chief confidence, and ardently solicited his return. The Lacedaemonians, to
gratify their allies, and yet to observe their laws, which forbad that honour
being conferred twice on the same person, sent him with an inferior
title, but with the power of admiral. Thus appoint∣ed, Lysander sailed
towards the Hellespont, and laid siege to Lampsacus; the place was
carried by storm, and abandoned by Lysander to the mercy of the soldiers.
The Athenians, who followed him close, upon the news of his success
steered forward towards Olestus, and from thence sailing along the
coast, halted over-against the enemy at Aegos Potamos, a place fatal for
the Athenians.</P>
<P>The Hellespont is not above two thousand paces broad in that
place. The two armies seeing themselves so near each other, expected only
to rest that day, and were in hopes of <PB N="327" REF="332"/> coming to a
battle on the next. But Lysander had another design in view; he commanded
the seamen and pilots to go on board their gallies, as if they were in
reality to fight the next morning at break of day, to hold them∣selves in
readiness, and to wait his orders in profound silence. He ordered the land
army in like manner to draw up in battle upon the coast, and to wait the day
without any noise. On the morning as soon as the sun was risen, the
Athenians began to row towards them with their whole fleet in one line, and to
bid them defiance. Lysander, though his ships were ranged in order of
battle, with their heads to∣wards the enemy, lay still without making any
movement. In the evening when the Athe∣nians withdrew, he did not suffer his
soldiers to go ashore till two or three gallies which he had sent out to
observe them, were returned with advice, that they had seen the enemy land.
The next day passed in the same man∣ner, as did the third and fourth.
Such a con∣duct, which argued reserve and apprehension, extremely augmented
the security and boldness of the Athenians, and inspired them with an
high contempt for an army, which fear pre∣vented from shewing themselves or
attempting any thing.</P>
<P><PB N="328" REF="333"/> Whilst this passed, Alcibiades, who was
near the fleet, took horse and came to the Athenian generals, to whom he
represented, that they kept upon a very disadvantageous coast, where
there were neither ports nor ci∣ties in the neighbourhood; that they were
ob∣liged to bring their provisions from Sestos, with great danger and
difficulty, and that they were very much in the wrong to suffer the
soldiers and mariners of the fleet, as soon as they were ashore to
straggle and disperse themselves at their pleasure, whilst the
enemy's fleet faced them in view, accustomed to execute the or∣ders of their
general with instant obedience, and upon the slightest signal. He
offered also to attack the enemy by land with a strong body of Thracian
troops and to force them to a battle. The generals, especially Tydeus and
Menander, jealous of their command, did not content themselves with
refusing his offers, from the opinion, that if the event proved un∣fortunate,
the whole blame would fall upon them, and if favourable, that Alcibiades would
engross the honour of it, but rejected also with insult his wise and
salutary counsel, as if a man in disgrace lost his sense and
abilities with the favour of the commonwealth. Alcibiades withdrew.</P>
<P><PB N="329" REF="334"/> The fifth day the Athenians presented
them∣selves again, and offered him battle, retiring in the evening according
to custom with more insulting airs than the days before. Lysander, as
usual, detached some gallies to observe them, with orders to return with
the utmost diligence when they saw the Athenians landed, and to put a brown
buckler at each ship's head as soon as they reached the middle of the
channel. Himself, in the mean time, ran through the whole line in his galley,
exhort∣ing the pilots and officers to hold the seamen and soldiers in
readiness to row and fight on the first signal.</P>
<P>As soon as the bucklers were put up in the ship's heads, and the
admiral's galley had given the signal by the sound of trumpet, the whole
fleet set forwards in good order. The land army, at the same time, made all
possible haste to the top of the promontory to see the battle. The
streight that separates the two continents in this place is about fifteen
stadia, or three quarters of a league in breadth, which space was
presently cleared through the activity and diligence of the rowers. Conon,
the Atheni∣an general, was the first who perceived from shore the enemy's
fleet advance in good order to attack him, upon which he immediately cri∣ed 
<PB N="330" REF="335"/> out for the troops to embark. In the height of sorrow
and perplexity, some he call∣ed to by their names, some he conjured, and
others he forced to go on board their gallies, but all his endeavours and
emotion were in∣effectual, the soldiers being dispersed on all sides.
For they were no sooner come on shore than some were run to the
suttlers, some to walk in the country, some to sleep in their tents,
and others had began to dress their sup∣pers. This proceeded from the want
of vigi∣lance and experience in their generals, who, not suspecting the
least danger, indulged them∣selves in taking their repose, and gave their
sol∣diers the same liberty.</P>
<P>The enemy had already fallen on with loud cries, and a great noise
of their oars, when Conon disengaging himself with nine gallies, of which
number was the sacred ship, he stood away for Cyprus, where he took
re∣fuge with Evagoras. The Peloponnesians falling upon the rest of the
fleet, took im∣mediately the gallies which were empty, and disabled and
destroyed such as began to fill with men. The soldiers who ran without
or∣der or arms to their relief, were either killed in the endeavour to get on
board, or flying on shore, were cut to pieces by the enemy, who 
<PB N="331" REF="336"/> landed in pursuit of them. Lysander took three
thousand prisoners, with all the generals, and the whole fleet, after
having plundered the camp, and fastened the enemy's gallies to the sterns
of his own, he returned to Lampsa∣cus amidst the sounds of flutes and
songs of triumph. It was his glory to have atchieved one of the greatest
military exploits recorded in history with little or no loss, and to have
terminated a war in the small space of an hour which had already lasted
seven and twenty years, and which, perhaps, without him had been of much
longer continuance. Lysander immediately sent dispatches with this
agreeable news to Sparta.</P>
<P>The three thousand prisoners taken in this battle having been
condemned to die, Lysan∣der called upon Philocles, one of the Athenian
generals, who had caused all the prisoners taken in two gallies, the one of
Andros, the other of Corinth, to be thrown from the top of a precipice, and had
formerly persuaded the people of Athens to make a decree for cutting off the
thumb of the right hand of all the prisoners of war, in order to disable
them for handling the pike, and that they might be fit only to serve at the
oar. Lysander, there∣fore, caused him to be brought forth, and 
<PB N="332" REF="337"/> asked him what sentence he would pass upon
himself for having induced his city to pass that cruel decree. Philocles,
without depart∣ing from his haughtiness in the least, notwith∣standing
the extreme danger he was in, made answer: 
<Q REND="inline">"Accuse not people of crimes who have no judges,
but as you are victors, use your right, and do by us as we had done by you if
we had conquered."</Q> At the same in∣stant he went into a bath, put on
afterwards a magnificent robe, and marched foremost to the execution. All the
prisoners were put to the sword except Adamantus, who had oppos∣ed the
decree.</P>
<P>When the news of the entire defeat of the army came to Athens, by a
ship which arrived in the night at the Piraeus, the city was in
consternation. They naturally expected a siege; and, in fact, Lysander
was preparing to besiege them. Nothing was heard but cries of sorrow and
despair in every part of it. They imagined the enemy already at their gates;
they represented to themselves the miseries of a long siege, a cruel
famine, the ruin and burning of their city, the insolence of a proud victor,
and the shameful slavery they were upon the point of experiencing, more
afflict∣ing and insupportable to them than the most <PB N="333" REF="338"/>
severe punishments, and death itself. The next day the assembly was
summoned, where∣in it was resolved to shut up all the ports, one only
excepted, to repair the breaches in the walls, and mount guard to prepare
against a siege.</P>
<P>Their fears were soon confirmed by reality. Lysander finding
numbers of Athenians dis∣persed in different cities, commanded them all on
pain of death to take shelter in Athens. This he did with a design, so to
croud the city as to be able soon to reduce it by famine. In effect, he
soon after arrived at the port of Athens with an hundred and fifty sail.
While Agis and Pausanias, the two kings of Sparta, advanced with their army
to besiege it by land.</P>
<P>The wretched Athenians thus hemmed in on every side, without
provisions, ships, or hopes of relief, prepared to meet the last
ex∣tremity with patience; in this manner, with∣out speaking the least word
of a capitulation, and dying in the streets by numbers, they ob∣stinately
continued on the defensive; but, at length, their corn and provisions being
entire∣ly consumed, they found themselves compelled to send deputies to
Agis, with offers of aban∣doning all their possessions, their city and 
<PB N="334" REF="339"/> port only excepted. The haughty Lacedae∣monian referred
their deputies to the state it∣self, and when the suppliant deputies had
made known their commission to the ephori, they were ordered to retire, and
to come with other proposals if they expected peace. At length, Theramenes,
an Athenian, undertook to manage the treaty with Lysander; and, af∣ter three
months of close conference, he re∣ceived full powers to treat at Lacedaemon.
When he, attended by nine others, arrived be∣fore the ephori, it was there
strongly urged by some of the confederates, that Athens should be totally
destroyed, without hearken∣ing to any farther proposals. But the
Lace∣daemonians told them, they would not destroy a city which had so
eminently rescued Greece in the most critical juncture, and consented to
a peace upon these conditions: that the long walls and fortifications of the
Piraeus should be demolished; that they should deliver up all their
ships but twelve; that they should restore their exiles; that they
should make a league offensive and defensive with the Lace∣daemonians,
and serve them in all their expe∣ditions, both by sea and land. Theramenes
be∣ing returned with the articles to Athens, was asked why he acted so
contrary to the inten∣tions <PB N="335" REF="340"/> of Themistocles, and gave
those walls in∣to the hands of the Lacedaemonians which he built in defiance
of them? I have my eye, says he, upon Themistocles his design; he
raised these walls for the preservation of the city, and I for the very
same reason would have them destroyed; for, if walls only secure a
city, Sparta, which has none, is in a very ill condition. The Athenians, at
another time, would not have thought this a satisfactory answer, but being
reduced to the last extremi∣ty, it did not admit of a long debate whether
they should accept the treaty. At last, Lysan∣der coming up the Piraeus,
demolished the walls with great solemnity, and all the insulting triumphs
of music. Thus a final period was put to this unhappy war, which had
con∣tinued for seven and twenty years, in which heaps of treasure and
deluge of blood were exhausted.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX. From the Demolition of the ATHENIAN Power to the Death
of SOCRATES.</HEAD>
<P>THE victory of Lysander was so terrible a shock to Athens,
that it only survived to be sensible of the loss of its own power;
however, the conquerors were so generous as not to ex∣tinguish the name;
they said they would not be guilty of putting out one of the eyes of Greece:
but they imposed some farther marks of conquest on them; they obliged the
people to demolish the democracy, and submit to the government of thirty
men, who were common∣ly known by the name of the thirty tyrants. Though the
Greeks were apt enough to give that name to men of virtuous characters, these
men, who were the creatures of Lysander, in every respect deserved the
most opprobrious de∣nomination; instead of compiling and publishing a
more perfect body of laws, which was the pre∣tence for their being chosen,
they began to exert their power of life and death: and though they
constituted a senate, and other magistrates, they made no farther use
of them than to confirm <PB N="337" REF="342"/> their authority, and to see
their commands executed. However, they at first acted cau∣tiously, and
condemned only the most detested and scandalous part of the citizens,
such as lived by evidencing and informing; but this was only to give a colour
to their proceedings; their design was to make themselves absolute, and
knowing that was not to be done without a foreign power, their next step was
to desire a guard might be sent them from Sparta, until such times as
they could clear the city of all disaffected persons, and thoroughly
settle the government. Lysander, accordingly, pro∣cured them a guard under
the command of Callibius, who, by bribes and artifices, was wrought over to
their designs, and then seen to act without controul, filling the city with
the blood of those who, on account of their riches, interest, or good
qualities, were most likely to make head against them.</P>
<P>One of the first acts of their cruelty was in procuring the death
of Alcibiades, who had taken refuge in the dominions of Persia. This
unfortunate general, still mindful of the debt he owed his country, employed
his utmost at∣tention in giving it the earliest notices of what could
effect its freedom or its safety. Cyrus, the prince of Persia, having
resolved to de∣throne <PB N="338" REF="343"/> his brother Artaxerxes, entered
into a treaty with the Lacedaemonians to assist him in his designs.
Alcibiades did all that was in his power to obstruct the scheme; but the
Lace∣daemonian partisans at Athens, that is to say, the thirty tyrants,
apprehended the intrigues of so superior a genius as his, and represented
to their masters that they were inevitably ruined, if they did not find means
to rid themselves of Alcibiades. The Lacedaemonians thereupon wrote to
Pharnabasus, and with an abject meanness not to be excused, and which
shewed how much Sparta had degenerated from her ancient manners, made
pressing instances to him to deliver them at any rate from so
formid∣able an enemy. This satrap complied with their wishes. Alcibiades
was then in a small town of Phrygia, where he lived with his concubine
Timandra. Those who were sent to kill him not daring to enter his house,
contented them∣selves with surrounding and setting it on fire. Alcibiades
having quitted it through the flames, sword in hand, the barbarians were
afraid to stay to come to blows with him, but slying and retreating as he
advanced, they poured their darts and arrows upon him from a distance, and he
fell dead upon the spot. Timandra took up his body, and having adorned and
covered <PB N="339" REF="344"/> it with the finest robes she had, she made
as magnificent a funeral for it as her present con∣dition would admit.</P>
<P>Such was the end of Alcibiades, whose great virtues were stifled
and suppressed by still greater vices. It is not easy to say
whether his good or bad qualities were most pernicious to his country, for
with the one he deceived, and with the other he oppressed it. In him
distinguished valour was united with nobility of blood. His person was
beautiful and finely made; he was eloquent, of great ability in af∣fairs,
insinuating, and formed for charming all mankind. He loved glory, but without
prejudice to his inclination sor pleasure, nor was he so fond of
pleasure as to neglect his glory for it: he knew how to give into, or
ab∣stract himself from the allurements of luxury, ac∣cording to the
situation of his affaris. Never was there ductility of genius equal to his,
he meta∣morphosed himself with incredible facility, into the most
contrary forms, and supported them all with as much ease and grace as if
each had been natural to him.</P>
<P>In this manner the thirty proceeded, and fearing to be opposed by
the multitude, they invested three thousand citizens with some part 
<PB N="340" REF="345"/> of their power, and by their assistance
preserv∣ed the rest. But thoroughly emblodened by such an accession
to their party, they agreed to single out every one his man, to put them to
death, and seize their estates for the main∣tenance of their gartison.
Theramenes, one of their number, was the only man that was struck with horror
at their proceedings; where∣fore Critias, the principal author, thought it
necessary to remove him, and accused him to the senate of endeavouring
to subvert the state. Sentence of death was, therefore, passed up∣on
him, and he was obliged to drink the juice of hemlock, the usual mode of
execution at that time in Athens. Socrates, whose disciple he had been, was
the only person of the senate who ventured to appear in his defence; he
made an attempt to rescue him out of the hands of the officer of justice,
and after his execution went about as it were in defiance of the thirty,
exhorting and animating the senators and citi∣zens against them.</P>
<P>The tyrants, delivered from a colleague whose presence alone was
a continual reproach to them, no longer observed any measures. Nothing
passed throughout the city but impri∣sonments and murders. Every body
trembled <PB N="341" REF="346"/> for themselves or their friends. The general
desolation had no remedy, nor was there any hope of regaining lost
liberty.</P>
<P>All the citizens of any consideration in Athens, and who retained
a love of freedom, quitted a place reduced to so hard and shame∣ful a
slavery, and sought elsewhere an asylum and retreat where they might
live in safety. The Lacedaemonians had the inhumanity to en∣deavour to
deprive those unhappy fugitives of this last resource. They published
an edict to prohibit the cities of Greece from giving them refuge, decreed that
they should be delivered up to the thirty tyrants, and condemned all such
as should contravene the execution of this edict to pay a fine of five
talents. Only two cities rejected with disdain so unjust an or∣dinance,
Megara and Thebes, the latter of which made a decree to punish all persons
whatsoever that should see an Athenian attack∣ed by his enemies without
doing his utmost to assist him. Lysias, an orator of Syracuse, who
had been banished by the thirty, raised five hundred soldiers at his own
expence, and sent them to the aid of the common country of eloquence.</P>
<P>Thrasybulus, a man of admirable character, who had long deplored
the miseries of his coun∣try, <PB N="342" REF="347"/> was now the first to
relieve it. At Thebes he fell into a consultation with his fellow-citi∣zens,
and the result was, that some vigorous effort, though it carried never so
much dan∣ger, ought to be made for the benefit of public liberty. Accordingly,
with a par∣ty of thirty men only, as Nepos says; but, as Xenophon more
probably says, of near seven∣ty, he seized upon Phyle, a strong
castle on the frontiers of Attica. This enterprize gave the alarm to the
tyrants, who immediately march∣ed out of Athens with their three thousand
followers, and their Spartan guard, and attempt∣ed the recovery of the place,
but were repulsed with loss. Finding they could not carry it by a sudden
assault, they resolved upon a siege, but not being sufficiently
provided for that ser∣vice, and a great snow falling that night, they were
forced to retire the next day into the city, leaving only part of their guard
to prevent any farther excursions into the country. Encou∣raged by this
success, Thrasybulus no longer kept himself confined, but marched out
of Phyle by night; and, at the head of a body of a thousand men, seized on
the Pyraeus. The thirty flew thither with their troops, and a battle
sufficiently warm ensued; but, as the soldiers on one side fought with
valour and <PB N="343" REF="348"/> vigour for their liberty, and, on the other
with, indolence and neglect for the power of their op∣pressors, the
success was not doubtful, but fol∣lowed the better cause: the tyrants
were over∣thrown; Critias was killed upon the spot; and, as the rest of the
army were taking to flight, Thrasybulus cried out, 
<Q REND="inline">"Wherefore do you fly from me as from a victor,
rather than assist me as the avenger of your liberty? We are not enemies,
but fellow-citizens, nor have we declared war against the city, but against
the thirty tyrants."</Q> He continued, with bid∣ding them remember that they
had the same origin, country, laws, and religion; he exhort∣ed them to
compassionate their exiled brethren, to restore to them their country,
and resume their liberty themselves. This discourse had suitable
effects. The army upon their return to Athens, expelled the thirty, and
substituted ten persons to govern in their room, but whose conduct
proved no better than that of those whom they succeeded.</P>
<P>Though the government was thus altered, and the thirty were
deposed from power, they still had hopes of being reinstated in their
for∣mer authority, and sent deputies to Lace∣daemon to demand aid. Lysander
was for <PB N="344" REF="349"/> granting it to them, but Pausanias, who then
reigned in Sparta, moved with compassion at the deplorable condition of the
Athenians, favoured them in secret, and obtained a peace for them; it was
sealed with the blood of the tyrants, who having taken arms to reinstate
themselves in government, were put to the sword, and Athens left in full
possession of its liberty. Thrasybulus then proposed an am∣nesty,
by which the citizens engaged upon oath that all past actions should be
buried in oblivion, and the government was re-established in its ancient
forms; their laws were restored to their past vigour, the magistrates
elected with the usual ceremonies, and democracy was once more restored to
this unfortunate people. Xenophon observes, that this intestine fury had
consumed as many in eight months, as the Peloponnesian war had done in ten
years.</P>
<P>Upon the re-establishment of affairs in Athens, the other
states enjoyed the same tranquility, or rather kept in a quiet
subjec∣tion to Sparta, which now held the undoubted sovereignty of Greece.
But it being a maxim with the Spartans, that this sovereignty was not to be
maintained but by a constant course of action; they were still seeking
fresh occa∣sions <PB N="345" REF="350"/> for war; and part of their forces,
to∣gether with another body of Grecians, being at this time engaged in a
quarrel between the Persian king and his brother, it will be neces∣sary
to pass over into Asia, and relate so much of the Persian affairs as
concerns the expedition of Cyrus, wherein those forces were employed,
especially since it is attended with circum∣stances which, if duly
considered, will easily make it pass for one of the greatest actions of
antiquity.</P>
<P>It has been already observed, that Cyrus, the son of Darius
Nothus, saw with pain his elder brother Artaxerxes upon the throne, and more
than once attempted to remove him. Arta∣xerxes was not insensible of what
he had to fear from a brother of his enterprising and am∣bitious spirit,
but could not refuse pardoning him on the prayers and tears of his mother
Parysatis, who doated upon this youngest son. He removed him, therefore,
into Asia to his go∣vernment, confiding in him contrary to all the rules of
policy, an absolute authority over the provinces left him by the will of the
king his father. He was no sooner appointed in this manner, but he used all
his arts with the bar∣barians and the Grecians to procure power and 
<PB N="346" REF="351"/> popularity, in order to dethrone his brother. Clearches
retired to his court, after having been banished from Sparta, and was of
great service to him, being an able, experienced, and valiant captain. At the
same time, several cities in the provinces of Tissaphernes revolted
from their obedience in favour of Cyrus. This incident, which was not an effect
of chance, but of the secret practices of that prince, gave birth to a war
between the two brothers. The emissaries of Cyrus at the court, were
perpetu∣ally dispersing reports and opinions amongst the people to
prepare their minds for the in∣tended change and revolt. They talked that the
state required a king of Cyrus's character, a king magnificent, liberal, who
loved war, and showered his favours upon those that serv∣ed him; and that
it was necessary, for the grandeur of the empire, to have a prince up∣on
the throne sired with ambition and valour, for the support and augmentation
of his glory.</P>
<P>The troops of Cyrus, which were apparent∣ly levied for the
business of the state, but in fact to overturn it, consisted of
thirteen thou∣sand Greeks, which were the flower and chief force of his army.
Clearches, the La∣cedaemonian, <PB N="347" REF="352"/> who commanded the
Pelopon∣nesian troops, was the only man of all the Greeks that was let into
the Persian prince's design; he made it his sole application to gain the
affections of his people during their marches, by treating them with humanity,
conversing freely with them, and giving ef∣fectual orders that they should
want for no∣thing. The Grecian troops knew neither the intent nor the
occasion of the war; they set out for Sardis, at length, and marched
towards the upper provinces of Athens.</P>
<P>When they were arrived at Tarfus, the Greeks refused to march any
farther, rightly suspecting that they were intended against the king, and
loudly exclaiming that they had not entered into the service upon that
condition. Clearchus, who commanded them, had occa∣sion for all his address
and ability to stifle this commotion in its birth. At first he made use
of authority and force, but with very ill success, and desisted
therefore from an open opposition to their sentiments: he even affect∣ed to
enter into their views, and to support them with his approbation and credit.
By this artful evasion he appeased the tumult, and made them easy; and
they chose him and some other officers for their deputies. Cyrus, whom 
<PB N="348" REF="353"/> he had secretly apprised of every thing, made
answer, that he was going to attack Abro∣comas, his enemy, at twelve days
march from thence upon the Euphrates. When this an∣swer was repeated to them,
though they plain∣ly saw against whom they were going, they re∣solved to
proceed, and only demanded an aug∣mentation of their pay. Cyrus, instead of
one daric a month to each soldier, promised to give them one and a half.
Still to ingratiate himself the more, being told that two officers had
deserted from the army, and being advis∣ed to pursue and put them to
death, he de∣clared publicly, that it should never be said he had detained
any one person in his service against his will; and he ordered their
wives and children, who were left as hostages in his army, to be sent after
them. A conduct so wise, and apparently generous, had a surpris∣ing
effect in conciliating the affections of the soldiery, and made even those
his firm adhe∣rents who were before inclined to retire.</P>
<P>As Cyrus advanced by long marches, he was informed from all parts,
that the king did not intend to come directly to a battle, but had re∣solved
to wait in the remotest parts of Persia till all his forces were
assembled; and that, to stop his enemies, he had ordered an intrench∣ment
<PB N="349" REF="354"/> to be thrown up on the plains of Babylon, with a ditch
of five fathoms broad, and three deep, extending the space of twelve
parasangs, or leagues, from the Euphrates to the wall of Media. Between the
Euphrates and the ditch, a way had been left of twenty feet in breadth, by
which Cyrus passed with his whole army, having reviewed it the day before.
The king had neglected to dispute this pass with him, and suffered him to
continue his march towards Babylon.</P>
<P>Cyrus still continued to proceed, giving Clearches the command of
the right Grecian wing, and Menon that of the left, still march∣ing in order
of battle, expecting every hour to engage; at length he discovered his
bro∣ther's army, consisting of twelve hundred thousand men, besides a
select body of six thousand horse, approaching and preparing to
engage.</P>
<P>The place where the battle was fought was called Cunara, about
twenty-five leagues from Babylon. Cyrus getting on horseback, with his
javelin in his hand, gave orders to the troops to stand to their arms, and
proceed in order of battle. The enemy, in the mean time, advanced slowly, in
good order. Arta∣xerxes led them on regularly with a slow pace, 
<PB N="350" REF="355"/> without noise or confusion. That good order and
exact discipline extremely surprised the Greeks, who expected to see
much luxury and tumult in so great a multitude, and to hear confused cries,
as Cyrus had foretold them.</P>
<P>The armies were not distant above four or five hundred paces, when
the Greeks began to sing the hymn of battle, and to march on softly at
first, and with silence. When they came near the enemy, they set up great
cries, strik∣ing their darts upon their shields to frighten the horse;
and then moving all together, they sprung forwards upon the barbarians with
all their force, who did not wait their charge, but took to their heels and
fled universally, ex∣cept Tissaphernes, who stood his ground with a
small part of his troops.</P>
<P>Cyrus saw with pleasure the enemy routed by the Greeks, and was
proclaimed king by those around him: but he did not give himself up to a
vain joy, nor as yet reckoned himself victor. He perceived that Artaxerxes
was wheeling his right to attack him in flank, and marched directly against
him with his six hun∣dred horse. He killed Artagerses, who com∣manded the
king's guard of six thousand horse, with his own hand, and put the whole
body to flight. Discovering his brother, he cried out <PB N="351" REF="356"/>
with his eyes sparkling with rage, I see him, and spurred against him,
followed only by his principal officers, for his troops had quitted their ranks
to follow the run-aways, which was an essential fault.</P>
<P>The battle then became a single combat in some measure between
Artaxerxes and Cyrus, and the two brothers were seen transported with rage
and fury, endeavouring like Eteocles and Polynices to plunge their swords
into each others hearts, and to assure themselves of the throne by the
death of their rival.</P>
<P>Cyrus having opened his way through those who were drawn up in
battle before Artaxerxes, joined him, and killed his horse, that fell with
him to the ground: he rose, and was re∣mounted upon another, when Cyrus
attacked him again, gave him a second wound, and was preparing to give him a
third, in hopes that it would prove his last. The king, like a lion wounded
by the huntsman, was only the more furious from the smart, and sprung
for∣wards, impetuously pushing his horse against Cyrus, who running
headlong, and without regard to his person, threw himself into the midst
of a flight of darts aimed at him from all sides, and received a wound from
the king's javelin at the instant that all the rest discharged 
<PB N="352" REF="357"/> upon him. Cyrus fell dead; some say by the wound
given him by the king, others affirm that he was killed by a Carian soldier.
The greatest persons of his court resolving not to survive so good a
master, were all killed around his body; a certain proof, says Xenophon,
that he well knew how to chuse his friends, and that he was truly beloved by
them. Ariae∣us, who ought to have been the firmest of all his adherents, fled
with the left wing as soon as he heard of his death.</P>
<P>Artaxerxes, after having caused the head and right hand of his
brother to be cut off by the eunuch Mesabates, pursued the enemy into their
camp. Ariaeus had not stopped there, but having passed through it,
continued his retreat to the place where the army had en∣camped the day before,
which was about four leagues distant.</P>
<P>Tissaphernes, after the defeat of the greatest part of his
lest wing by the Greeks, led on the rest against them, and, by the side
of the river, passed through the light armed infantry of the Greeks, who
opened to give him a passage, and made their discharges upon him as he
pass∣ed, without losing a man. They were com∣manded by Episthenes of
Amphipolis, who was esteemed an able captain. Tissaphernes 
<PB N="353" REF="358"/> kept on without returning to the charge, be∣cause he
perceived he was too weak, and went forward to Cyrus's camp, where he found the
king, who was plundering it, but had not been able to force the quarter
defended by the Greeks, who saved their baggage.</P>
<P>The Greeks on their side, and Artaxerxes on his, who did not know
what had passed elsewhere, believed each of them that they had gained the
victory; the first, because they had put the enemy to flight, and pursued
them; and the king, because he had killed his brother, beat the troops he had
fought, and plundered their camp. The event was soon cleared up on both
sides. Tissaphernes, upon his arrival at the camp, informed the king,
that the Greeks had defeated his left wing, and pursued it with great vigour;
and the Greeks, on their side, learnt, that the king in pursuing Cyrus's
left had penetrated into the camp. Upon this advice the king rallied his
troops, and marched in quest of the enemy; and Clearchus being returned from
pursuing the Persians, advanced to support the camp.</P>
<P>The two armies were soon very near each other, when, by a movement
made by the <PB N="354" REF="359"/> king, he seemed to intend to charge the
Greeks on their left, who fearing to be surrounded on all sides, wheeled
about and halted, with the river on their backs, to prevent their being taken
in the rear. Upon seeing that, the king changed his form of battle also,
drew up his army in front of them, and marched on to the attack. As soon as
the Greeks saw him ap∣proach, they began to sing the hymn of battle, and
advanced against the enemy even with more ardour than in the first
action.</P>
<P>The barbarians again began to fly, running farther than before, and
were pursued to a village at the foot of a hill, upon which their horse
halted. The king's standard was ob∣served to be there, which was a golden
eagle upon the top of a pike, having its wings dis∣played. The Greeks
preparing to pursue them, they abandoned also the hill, fled pre∣cipitately
with all their troops broke, and in the utmost disorder and confusion.
Clearchus having drawn up the Greeks at the bottom of the hill, ordered Lycias,
the Syracusan, and another, to go up it and observe what passed in the
plain. They returned with an ac∣count that the enemies fled on all sides, and
that their whole army was routed.</P>
<P><PB N="355" REF="360"/> As it was almost night, the Greeks laid
down their arms to rest themselves, much surprised that neither Cyrus,
nor any one from him appear∣ed; and imagining, that he was either engag∣ed in
the pursuit of the enemy, or was making haste to possess himself of
some important place, for they were still ignorant of his death, and the
defeat of the rest of his army; they determined, to return to their camp, and
found the greatest part of the baggage taken, with all the provisions, and
four hun∣dred waggons laden with corn and wine, which Cyrus had expressly
caused to be carried along with the army for the Greeks, in case of any
pressing necessity. They passed the night in the camp, the
greatest part of them without any refreshment, concluding that Cyrus was
alive and victorious.</P>
<P>Amidst the confusion the Grecians were in after the battle, they
sent to Ariaeus, as con∣queror and commander in chief, upon Cyrus's death, to
offer him the Persian crown. In the mean time, the king, as conqueror, also
on his side, sent to them to surrender their arms, and implore his mercy,
representing to them, at the same time, that as they were in the heart of
his dominions, surrounded with vast rivers, and numberless nations, it
would <PB N="356" REF="361"/> be impossible for them to escape his
venge∣ance; and, therefore, they had nothing to do but to submit to the
present necessity. Upon debating among themselves what answer they
should return, Proxenus desired to know of the heralds upon what terms the
king demand∣ed their arms: if, as conqueror, it was in his power to take them;
if upon any other footing, what would he give them in return. He was seconded
by Xenophon, who said, they had nothing left but their arms and their
liberty, and that they could not preserve the one with∣out the other.
Clearchus said to the same effect, that if the king was disposed to be
their friend, they should be in a better capa∣city of serving him with arms
than without; if their enemy, they should have need of them for their
defence. Some indeed spoke in terms more complying; that as they had served
Cy∣rus faithfully, they would also serve Artaxerxes, if he would employ
them, and provided he would, at the same time, put them in
posses∣sion of Egypt. At last it was agreed, they should remain in
the place where they were; and that if they advanced farther, or retreated
back, it should be looked upon as a declara∣tion of war: so that by the
issue of the debate, it appeared to have been managed so as to 
<PB N="357" REF="362"/> avoid giving a direct answer, but only to amuse the
king and gain time.</P>
<P>Whilst this treaty was on foot, they receiv∣ed Ariaeus's answer,
that there were too many powerful men in Persia to let him possess the
throne; wherefore he intended to set out early the next morning on his return
to Greece; and that, if they had a mind to accompany him, they should join
him that night in his camp: which accordingly they all did, except
Mil∣thocytus, a Thracian, who went with a party of three hundred men and forty
horse to the king. The rest, in conjunction with Ariaeus's forces, decamped
by break of day, and con∣tinued their march until sun-set, when they
discovered from the neighbouring villages that the king was in pursuit of
them.</P>
<P>Clearchus, who now undertook to conduct the Greeks, ordered his
troops to halt, and prepared for an engagement. The king of Per∣sia terrified
by so bold an appearance, sent he∣ralds not to demand their surrender,
but to propose terms of peace and treaty. When Clearchus was informed of
their arrival, he gave orders to bid them wait, and to tell them that he was
not yet at leisure to hear them. He assumed purposely an air of
haughtiness and <PB N="358" REF="363"/> grandeur, to denote his intrepidity,
and, at the same time, to shew the fine appearance and good condition of
his phalanx. When he advanced with the most shewy of his officers,
expressly chosen for the occasion, and had heard what the heralds had to
propose; he made answer, that they must begin with giv∣ing battle,
because the army being in want of provisions had no time to lose. The
heralds having carried back this answer to their master, returned
immediately, which shewed that the king, or whoever spoke in his name, was
not very far distant. They said they had orders to conduct them to villages
where they would find provisions in abundance, and conducted them thither
accordingly.</P>
<P>After three days stay Tissaphernes arrived from the king, and
insinuated to them the good offices he had employed for their safety.
Clearchus in his own defence urged, that they were engaged in this expedition
without know∣ing the enemy against whom they were to con∣tend; that they were
free from all engage∣ments, and had no design against the Persian king,
unless he opposed their return. Tissa∣phernes seemingly granted their
desire, and promised that they should be furnished with all 
<PB N="359" REF="364"/> necessary provisions in their march; and to
confirm their security, that he himself would be their companion on the
way.</P>
<P>Accordingly, in a few days after they set out under his conduct;
but, in their march, the barbarians encamping at about a league's distance
from the Grecians, created some little distrusts and jealousies on both
sides. In about fifty days, being got to the banks of the river Zabatus,
Clearchus, to prevent things coming to an open rupture, had a conference with
Tissaphernes. The result of their discourse was, that they had been
misrepresented to each other by some of Clearchus's officers; and that he
should bring them all to Tissaphernes, in order to detect those who
were guilty. In con∣sequence of this, it was agreed between them that there
should be a general consultation of officers, in which those who had been
remiss, or attempted to sow any dissensions between the two armies,
should be exposed and punish∣ed. Menon, in particular, was suspected
on both sides, and he was appointed among the number. In consequence of
this fatal resolu∣tion, the five principal generals attended the succeeding
day at the Persian general's tent. Their names were, Clearchus, Menon,
Prox∣enes, Agias, and Socrates; they, on a signal <PB N="360" REF="365"/>
given, were immediately seized, their attend∣ants put to the sword, and
themselves, after being sent bound to the king, were beheaded in his
presence.</P>
<P>Nothing could exceed the consternation of the Greeks when they
were informed of the massacre of their generals: they were now near two
thousand miles from home, surrounded with great rivers, extensive
desarts, and inimical nations, without any supplies of provisions. In
this state of general dejection, they could think of taking neither
nourishment nor repose; all now turned their eyes upon Xenophon, a young
Athenian, who had been invited into Asia by Proxences, and had hitherto
served as a volun∣teer in the army: this was that Xenophon af∣terwards so
famous as an historian; and his conduct seemed equal to his eloquence, in
which he surpassed all the rest of mankind. This young general went to
some of the Greek officers in the middle of the night, and repre∣sented to
them that they had no time to lose; that it was of the last importance to
prevent the bad designs of the enemy; that, however small their number,
they would render themselves formidable, if they behaved with boldness and
resolution; that valour, and not multitudes, determines the success of
arms; and that it <PB N="361" REF="366"/> was necessary, above all things,
to nominate generals immediately, because an army with∣out commanders is like
a body without a soul. A council was immediately held, at which an hundred
officers were present; and Xenophon being desired to speak, deduced the
reasons at large he had at first but lightly touched upon: and, by his
advice, commanders were appoint∣ed. They were, Timasion for Clearchus,
Xan∣thicles for Socrates, Cleanor for Agis, Phile∣sius for Menon, and
Xenophon for Proxenes.</P>
<P>Before the break of day they assembled the army. The generals
made speeches to animate the troops; and Xenophon, among the rest. 
<Q REND="inline">"Fellow-soldiers, said he, the loss of so
many brave men by vile treachery, and the being abandoned by our friends, is
very deplorable; but we must not sink under our misfortunes: and, if we
cannot conquer, let us chuse rather to perish gloriously than to fall
into the hands of barbarians, who would inflict upon us the greatest
miseries; let us call to mind the glori∣ous battles of Plataea, Thermopylae,
Salamis, and the many others wherein our ancestors, though with a small
number, have fought and defeated the innumerable armies of the Per∣sians, and
thereby rendered the name alone of Greeks for ever formidable. It is to their 
<PB N="362" REF="367"/> invincible valour we owe the honour we possess of
acknowledging no masters upon earth but the gods, nor any happiness but
what consists with liberty. Those gods, the avengers of perjury, and
witnesses of the enemy's treason, will be favourable to us; and, as they
are at∣tacked in the violation of treaties, and take pleasure in humbling the
proud, and exalting the low, they will also follow us to battle and combat
for us. For the rest, fellow-soldiers, as we have no refuge but in victory,
which must be our hope, and will make us ample amends for whatever it costs
to attain it; I should be∣lieve, if it were your opinion, that for the making
a more ready and less difficult retreat, it would be very proper to rid
ourselves of all the useless baggage, and to keep only what is
absolutely necessary in our march."</Q> All the soldiers that moment
lifted up their hands, to signify their approbation and consent to all that
had been said, and without loss of time set fire to their tents and
carriages; such of them as had too much equipage, giving it others who had
too little, and destroying the rest.</P>
<P>Cherisophus, the Spartan general, led the van, and Xenophon, with
Tymasion, brought up the rear. They bent their march towards 
<PB N="363" REF="368"/> the heads of the great rivers, in order to pass them
where they were fordable. But they had made little way before they were
followed by a party of the enemy's archers and slingers, commanded by
Mithridates, which galled their rear, and wounded several of them, who be∣ing
heavy armed, and without cavalry, could make no resistance. To prevent the
like in∣convenience, Xenophon furnished two hundred Rhodians with slings,
and mounted fifty more of his men upon baggage-horses; so that when
Mithridates came up with them a second time, and with a much greater body, he
repulsed them with loss, and made good his retreat with this handful of
men, until he arrived near the city of Larissa, on the banks of the Tigris.
From thence they marched to another desolate city, called Mepsila, and
about four leagues from that place Tissaphernes came up to them with his
whole army in order of battle, but after several skirmishes was forced to
retire. In a few days after he secured an eminence over which the Grecians
were obliged to make their way, which Xenophon perceiving, took a detachment of
the army, and with great dili∣gence gained the top of a mountain which
commanded that eminence, from whence he <PB N="364" REF="369"/> easily
dislodged the enemy, and made good a passage for the rest of his troops
into the plain, where they found plenty of provisions, though
Tissaphernes had done what he could before to burn and destroy the
country.</P>
<P>But still they were under as great difficulties as ever, being
bounded on the one hand by the Tigris, and on the other by inaccessible
mountains, inhabited by the Carduch, a fierce and warlike people; and who,
Xenophon says, had cut off an army of six score thousand Persians to
a man, by reason of the difficulty of the ways. However, having no boats to
cross the river, and the passage through the mountains opening into the
rich plains of Ar∣menia, they resolved to pursue their march that way.
These barbarians soon took the alarm, but not being prepared to meet the
Greeks in a body, they possessed themselves of the tops of the rocks
and mountains, and from thence annoyed them with darts and great stones,
which they threw down into the desiles through which they passed, in
which they were also attacked by several other parties; and though their
loss was not considerable, yet, what with storms and famine, besides
seven tedious days march, and being continually forced to fight their 
<PB N="365" REF="370"/> way, they underwent more fatigue and hard∣ship than
they had suffered from the Persians during the whole expedition.</P>
<P>They found themselves soon after exposed to new dangers.
Almost at the foot of the mountains, they came to a river two hundred feet in
breadth, called Centrites, which stop∣ped their march. They had to defend
them∣selves against the enemy, who pursued them in the rear, and the
Armenians, the soldiers of the country, who defended the opposite side of
the river. They attempted in vain to pass it in a place where the water came
up to their arm pits, and were carried away by the rapidity of the current,
against which the weight of their arms made them unable to re∣sist. By
good fortune they discovered another place not so deep, where some
soldiers had seen the people of the country pass. It required abundance
of address, diligence, and valour, to keep off the enemy on both sides of
them. The army, however, passed the river at length without much
loss.</P>
<P>They marched forwards with less interrup∣tion, passed the
source of the Tygris, and ar∣rived at the little river Teleboa, which is very
beautiful, and has many villages on its banks. Here began the western
Armenia, which was <PB N="366" REF="371"/> governed by Tiribasus, a satrap
much beloved by the king, and who had the honour to help him to mount on
horseback when at the court. He offered to let the army pass, and to
suffer the soldiers to take all they wanted, upon condi∣tion that they
should commit no ravages in their march; which proposal was accepted and
ratified on each side. Tiribasus kept always a flying camp at a small
distance from the army. There fell a great quantity of snow, which gave the
troops some inconvenience; and they learnt from a prisoner, that
Tiribasus had a de∣sign to attack the Greeks at a pass of the mountains,
in a defile through which they must necessarily march. They prevented
him, by seizing that post, after having put the enemy to flight. After
some days march through the desart, they passed the Euphrates near its
source, not having the water above their middles.</P>
<P>They suffered exceedingly afterwards from a north wind, which blew
in their faces, and prevented respiration; so that it was thought
necessary to sacrifice to the wind, upon which it seemed to abate. They
marched on in snow five or six feet deep, which killed several
ser∣vants and beasts of burden, besides thirty sol∣diers. They made
fires during the night, for <PB N="367" REF="372"/> they found plenty of wood.
All the next day they continued their march through the snow, when many of
them, from the excess of hun∣ger, followed with languor, or fainting,
con∣tinued lying upon the ground through weak∣ness and want of spirits:
when something had been given them to eat, they found them∣selves relived,
and continued their march.</P>
<P>After a march of seven days they arrived at the river Araxes,
called also the Phasus, which is about an hundred feet in breadth. Two days
after they discovered the Phasians, the Cha∣lybes, and the T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ochians, who kept the pass of the
mountain to prevent their descending in∣to the plain. They saw it was
impossible to avoid coming to a battle with them, and re∣solved to give
it the same day. Xenophon, who had observed that the enemy defended on∣ly
the ordinary passage, and that the mountain was three leagues in extent,
proposed the send∣ing a detachment to take possession of the
heights that commanded the enemy, which would not be difficult, as they might
prevent all suspicion of their design by a march in the night, and by
making a false attack by the main road to amuse the barbarians. This was
accordingly executed, the enemy put to slight, and the pass cleared. Thus,
after twelve or <PB N="368" REF="373"/> fifteen days march, they arrived at a
very high mountain, called Tecqua, from whence they descried the sea. The
first who perceived it raised great shouts of joy for a considerable
time, which made Xenophon imagine that the vanguard was attacked, and went with
all haste to support it. As he approached nearer, the cry of the sea! the
sea! was heard distinctly, and the alarm changed into joy and gaiety; and
when they came to the top, nothing was heard but a confused noise of the
whole army, crying out together, the sea! the sea! whilst they could not
refrain from tears, nor from embracing their generals and officers; and then,
without waiting for orders, they heaped up a pile of stones, and erected a
trophy with broken bucklers and other arms.</P>
<P>From thence they advanced to the moun∣tains of Colchis, one of which
was higher than the rest, and of that the people of the country had
possessed themselves. The Greeks drew up in battle at the bottom of
it to ascend, for the access was not impracticable. Xenophon did not judge
it proper to march in line of battle, but by files, because the soldiers
could not keep their ranks from the inequality of the ground, that in some
places were easy, in others difficult to climb, which might discourage 
<PB N="369" REF="374"/> them. That advice was approved, and the army formed
according to it. The heavy∣armed troops amounted to fourscore files, each
consisting of about one hundred men; with eighteen hundred light-armed
soldiers, divided in three bodies, one of which was posted on the right,
another on the left, and a third in the center. After having encouraged his
troops, by representing to them that this was the last obstacle they had
to surmount, and implored the assistance of the gods, the army began to
ascend the hill. The enemy were not able to support their charge, and
dispersed. They passed the mountain, and encamped in villages, where
they found provisions in abund∣ance.</P>
<P>A very strange accident happened there to the army, which put them
into great consterna∣tion; for the soldiers finding abundance of bee∣hives
in that place, and eating the honey, they were taken with violent vomiting and
fluxes, attended with raving fits; so that those who were least ill
seemed like drunken men, and the rest either furiously mad or dying. The
earth was strewed with their bodies as after a defeat; however, none of them
died, and the distemper ceased the next day, about the same hour it had
taken them. The third or fourth <PB N="370" REF="375"/> day the soldiers got
up, but in the condition people are in after taking a violent medicine.</P>
<P>Two days after the army arrived near Tre∣bisond, a Greek colony of
Sinopians, situated upon the Euxine, or Black Sea, in the pro∣vince of
Colchis. Here they lay encamped for thirty days, and acquitted themselves of
the vows they had made to Jupiter, Hercules, and the other deities, to obtain
an happy re∣turn into their own country: they also cele∣brated the games of
horse and foot races, wrestling, boxing, the pancratium, the whole attended
with the greatest joy and solemnity. Here Xenophon formed a project of
settling them in those parts, and founding a Grecian colony, which was
approved of by some; but his enemies representing it to the army only as a
more honourable way of abandoning them; and to the inhabitants as a design to
subdue and enslave the country, he was forced to give over that enterprize.
However, the noise of it had this good effect, that the natives did what they
could in a friendly manner to pro∣cure their departure, advising them to go
by sea as the safest way, and furnished them with a sufficient number
of transports for that purpose.</P>
<P><PB N="371" REF="376"/> Accordingly they embarked with a fair wind,
and the next day got into the harbour of Sinope, where Cherisophus met them
with some gallies; but instead of the money they had also expected from
him, he only told them they should be paid their arrears as soon as they
got out of the Euxine sea. But this answer occasioned a great deal of
murmuring and discontent among them; so that they re∣solved to put
themselves under one general, desiring Xenophon in the most pressing
and af∣fectionate terms to accept of that command, which he modestly
declined, and procured the choice to fall upon Cherisophus. But he en∣joyed
it not above six or seven days; for no sooner were they arrived at
Heraclea, than the army deposed him for refusing to extort a sum of money
from the inhabitants of that city; which being a Grecian colony, Xenophon
likewise refused to concern himself in that af∣fair; so that the army
being disappointed in their hopes of plunder, fell into a mutiny, and divided
into three bodies, after suffering a slight retreat. When divided from
their bar∣barian enemies, they were happily reunited and encamped at the port
of Calpe, where they set∣tled the command as before, substituting Neon in
the room of Cherisophus, who died here, <PB N="372" REF="377"/> and making it
death for any man hencefor∣ward to propose the dividing of the army. But
being streightened for provisions, they were forced to spread
themselves in the vallies, where Pharnabazus's horse, being joined by the
inhabitants, cut in pieces five hundred of them; the rest escaping to a
hill, were rescued and brought off by Xenophon, who after this led them
through a large forest, where Pharna∣bazus had posted his troops to
oppose their passage; but they entirely defeated him, and pursued their
march to Chrysopolis of Chal∣cedon, having got a great deal of booty in their
way, and from thence to Byzantium.</P>
<P>From thence he led them to Salmydessa, to serve Seuthes prince
of Thrace, who had be∣force sollicited Xenophon by his envoys to bring troops
to his aid, in order to his re-establish∣ment in his father's dominions, of
which his enemies had deprived him. He had made Xenophon great promises for
himself and his troops; but when he had done him the service he wanted, he
was so far from keeping his word, that he did not give them the pay agreed
upon. Xenophon reproached him exceeding∣ly with this breach of faith, imputing
his per∣fidy to his minister Heraclides, who thought to make his court to his
master by saving him <PB N="373" REF="378"/> a sum of money at the expence
of justice, faith, and honesty, qualities which ought to be dearer than all
others to a prince, as they contribute the most to his reputation, as well as
to the success of affairs, and the security of a state. But that
treacherous minister, who looked upon honour, probity, and justice as mere
chimeras; and that there was nothing real but the possession of much
money, had no thoughts, in consequence, but of enriching himself by any
means whatsoever, and robbed his master first with impunity, and all his
sub∣jects along with him. However, continued Xenophon, every wise man,
especially in au∣thority and command, ought to regard jus∣tice, probity,
and the faith of engagements as the most precious treasure he can
possess, and as an assured resource and an infallible support in
all the events that can happen. Heraclides was the more in the wrong for acting
in this manner with regard to the troops, as he was a native of Greece, and not
a Thracian; but avarice had extinguished all sense of honour in him.</P>
<P>Whilst the dispute between Seuthes and Xenophon was warmest,
Charminus and Poly∣nices arrived as ambassadors from Lacedae∣mon, and
brought advice, that the republic <PB N="374" REF="379"/> had declared war
against Tissaphernes and Pharnabazus; that Thimbron had already embarked
with the troops, and promised a darick a month to every soldier, two to
each officer, and four to the colonels, who should engage in the service.
Xenophon accepted the offer, and having obtained from Seuthes, by the mediation
of the ambassadors, part of the pay due to him, he went by sea to
Lamp∣sacus with the army, which amounted at that time to almost six
thousand men. From thence he advanced to Pergamus, a city in the pro∣vince of
Troas. Having met near Parthenia, where ended the expedition of the Greeks, a
great nobleman returning into Persia, he took him, his wife and children,
with all his equipage, and by that means found himself in a condi∣tion to
bestow great liberalities amongst the soldiers, and to make them a
satisfactory a∣mends for all the losses they had sustained. Thimbron
at length arrived, who took upon him the command of the troops, and having
joined them with his own, marched against Tis∣saphernes and
Pharnabazus.</P>
<P>Such was the event of Cyrus's expedition. Xenophon reckons from the
first setting out of that prince's army from the city of Ephesus to their
arrival where the battle was fought, <PB N="375" REF="380"/> five hundred and
thirty parasangas, or leagues, and fourscore and thirteen days march; and
in their return from the place of battle to Cotyora, a city upon the coast of
the Euxine, or Black Sea, six hundred and twenty parasangas, or leagues,
and one hundred and twenty days march; and, adding both together, he says the
way going and coming was eleven hundred and fifty-five parasangas, or
leagues, and two hundred and fifteen days march; and that the whole time the
army took to perform that journey, including the days of rest, was fifteen
months.</P>
<P>This retreat of the ten thousand Greeks has always passed
among judges of the art of war as a most extraordinary undertaking, and it,
in some measure, inspired them ever after with a contempt for the power
of the Persians; it taught them, that their dominions could be invaded
without danger, and that marching into Per∣sia was but pursuing an
unresisting enemy, that only appeared to offer victory rather than
battle.</P>
<P>In the mean time, while Greece was gaining fame in Persia, Athens
was losing its honour at home: though it had now some breathing∣time to
recover from its late confusions, yet still there were the seeds of
rancour remaining, <PB N="376" REF="381"/> and the citizens opposed each other
with unre∣mitting malice. Socrates was the first object that fell a
sacrifice to these popular dissen∣sions. We have already seen this
great man, who was the son of an obscure citizen at Athens, emerging from
the meanness of his birth, and giving examples of courage, moderation, and
wisdom; we have seen him saving the life of Alcibiades in battle, of
refusing to concur in the edict which unjustly doomed the six Athenian
generals to death, of withstanding the thirty tyrants, and of spurning the
bigotry and persecution of the times with the most acute penetration, and
the most caustic raillery; he possessed unexampled good-nature, and
an universal love to mankind; he was ready to pity vices in others, while he
was in a great measure free from them himself; however, he knew his own
defects, and if he was proud of any thing, it was in the being thought to have
none. He seemed, says Libanius, the common father of the republic, so
attentive was he to the happiness and advantage of his whole country. But as
it is very difficult to correct the aged, and to make people change principles,
who revere the errors in which they have grown grey, he devoted his labours
principally to the instruction of youth, in or∣der <PB N="377" REF="382"/> to
sow the seeds of virtue in a soil more fit to produce the fruits of it.
He had no open school like the rest of the philosophers, nor set times
for his lessons; he had no benches pre∣pared, nor ever mounted a
professor's chair; he was the philosopher of all times and sea∣sons;
he taught in all places, and upon all oc∣casions, in walking, conversation
at meals, in the army, and in the midst of the camp, in the public
assemblies of the senate or people. Such was the man whom a faction in
the city had long devoted to destruction; he had been for many years before
his death the object of their satire and ridicule. Aristophanes, the comic
poet, was engaged to expose him upon the stage: he composed a piece
called the Clouds, wherein he introduced the philosopher in a basket,
uttering the most ridiculous ab∣surdities. Socrates, who was present at
the exhibition of his own character, seemed not to feel the least emotion;
and, as some strangers were present who desired to know the original
for whom the play was intended, he rose up from his seat, and shewed
himself during the whole representation. This was the first blow struck
at him, and it was not till twenty years after that Melitus appeared in a more
formal man∣ner as his accuser, and entered a regular pro∣cess 
<PB N="378" REF="383"/> against him. His accusation consisted of two
heads; the first was, that he did not ad∣mit the gods acknowledged by the
republic, and introduced new divinities: the second, that he corrupted the
youth of Athens; and concluded with inferring that sentence of death ought to
pass against him. How far the whole charge affected him is not easy to
de∣termine: it is certain, that amidst so much zeal and superstition as
then reigned in Athens, he never durst openly oppose the received
re∣ligion, and was therefore sorced to preserve an outward shew of it;
but it is very pro∣bable, from the discourses he frequently held with his
friends, that in his heart he despised and laughed at their monstrous
opinions and ridiculous mysteries, as having no other foun∣dation than the
fables of the poets; and that he had attained to the notion of the one only
true God, insomuch, that upon the account both of his belief of the Deity,
and the ex∣emplariness of his life, some have thought fit to rank him with
the Christian philosophers.</P>
<P>As soon as the conspiracy broke out, the friends of Socrates
prepared for his defence. Lycias, the must able orator of his time, brought
him an elaborate discourse of his composing, wherein he had set forth
the rea∣sons <PB N="379" REF="384"/> and measures of Socrates in their full
force, and interspered the whole with tender and pathetic strokes, capable
of moving the most obdurate hearts. Socrates read it with pleasure, and
approved it very much; but, as it was more conformable to the rules of
rhe∣toric, than the sentiments and fortitude of a philosopher, he told him
frankly, that it did not suit him. Upon which Lycias having asked how it
was possible to be well done, and at the same time not suit him? In the
same manner, said he, using according to his cus∣tom a vulgar
comparison, that an excellent workman might bring me magnificent apparel, or
shoes embroidered with gold, to which no∣thing would be wanting on his part,
but which, however, would not fit me. He per∣sisted, therefore, inflexibly
in the resolution not to demean himself by begging suffrages in the low
abject manner common at that time. He employed neither artifice nor the glitter
of eloquence; he had no recourse either to sollici∣tation or entreaty; he
brought neither his wife nor children to incline the judges in his favour by
their sighs and tears: nevertheless, though he firmly refused to make
use of any other voice but his own in his defence, and to appear before his
judges in the submissive pos∣ture <PB N="380" REF="385"/> of a
suppliant, he did not behave in that manner out of pride or contempt of the
tri∣bunal; it was from a noble and intrepid as∣surance, resulting from
greatness of soul, and the consciousness of his truth and innocence;
so that his defence had nothing timorous or weak in it: his discourse was
bold, manly, ge∣nerous, without passion, without emotion, full of the noble
liberty of a philosopher, with no other ornament than that of truth, and
brightened universally with the character and language of innocence. Plato,
who was pre∣sent, transcribed it afterwards, and without any additions,
composed from it the work which he calls the Apology of Socrates, one of the
most consummate master-pieces of antiquity. I shall here make an
extract from it.</P>
<P>Upon the day assigned, the proceedings commenced in the usual
forms; the parties appeared before the judges, and Melitus spoke: the worse
his cause, and the less pro∣vided it was with proofs, the more occasion
he had for address and art to cover its weak∣ness; he omitted nothing that
might render the adverse party odious; and, instead of rea∣sons which
could not but fail him, he substi∣tuted the delusive shine of a lively
and pom∣pous eloquence. Socrates, in observing, that <PB N="381" REF="386"/>
he could not tell what impression the discourse of his accusers might
make upon the judges, owns, that for his part, he scarce knew him∣self,
they had given such artful colouring and likelihood to their arguments,
though there was not the least word of truth in all they had advanced.</P>
<Q><P>I am accused of corrupting the youth, and of instilling
dangerous maxims into them, as well in regard to the worship of the gods as
the rules of government. You know, Athe∣nians, that I never made it my
profession to teach, nor can envy, however violent against me, reproach
me with having ever sold my in∣structions. I have an undeniable evidence
for me in this respect, which is my poverty. Al∣ways equally ready to
communicate my thoughts either to the rich or poor, and to give them entire
leisure to question or answer me. I lend myself to every one who is
desir∣ous of becoming virtuous; and if, amongst those who hear me, there
are any that prove either good or bad, neither the virtues of the one, nor the
vices of the other, to which I have not contributed, are to be ascribed to
me. My whole employment is to persuade the young and old against too much
love for the body, for riches, and all other precarious 
<PB N="382" REF="387" MS="y"/> things, of whatsoever nature they be; and
against too little regard for the soul, which ought to be the object of
their affection. For I incessantly urge to you, that virtue does not
proceed from riches; but, on the contrary, riches from virtue; and that the all
other goods of human life, as well public as private, have their source in
the same principle.</P> 
<P>If to speak in this manner be to corrupt youth, I confess,
Athenians, that I am guilty, and deserve to be punished. If what I say be
not true, it is most easy to convict me of my falshood. I see here a
great number of my disciples; they have only to appear. But, per∣haps, the
reserve and consideration for a master who has instructed them, will
prevent them from declaring against me; at least their fa∣thers, brothers,
and uncles cannot, as good relations and good citizens, dispense with their
not standing forth to demand vengeance against the corrupter of their
sons, brothers, and nephews. But these are the persons who take upon them
my defence, and interest themselves in the success of my cause.</P> 
<P>Pass on me what sentence you please, Athenians; but I can
neither repent or change my conduct; I must not abandon or suspend a
function which God himself has imposed on <PB N="383" REF="388"/> me. Now he
has charged me with the care of instructing my fellow-citizens. If after
having faithfully kept all the posts wherein I was placed by our generals at
Potidaea, Am∣phipolis, and Delium, the fear of death should at this time make
me abandon that in which the divine Providence has placed me, by com∣manding me
to pass my life in the study of philosophy for the instruction of
myself and others; this would be a most criminal deser∣tion indeed, and
make me highly worthy of be∣ing cited before this tribunal as an impious man
who does not believe the gods. Should you resolve to acquit me; for the
future, I should not hesitate to make answer, Athenians, I honour and
love you; but I shall chuse rather to obey God than you, and to my latest
breath shall never renounce my philo∣sophy, nor cease to exhort and
reprove you according to my custom, by telling each of you when you come in
my way, My good friend and citizen of the most famous city in the world for
wisdom and valour, are you not ashamed to have no other thoughts than that
of amassing wealth and of acquiring glory, credit, and dignities, whilst
you neglect the treasures of prudence, truth, and wisdom, and 
<PB N="384" REF="389"/> take no pains in rendering your soul as good and
perfect as it is capable of being.</P> 
<P>I am reproached with abject fear and meanness of spirit, for
being so busy in im∣parting my advice to every one in private, and for
having always avoided to be present in your assemblies to give my
counsels to my country. I think I have sufficiently proved my courage and
fortitude both in the field, where I have borne arms with you, and in the
senate, where I alone opposed the unjust sen∣tence you pronounced
against the ten captains, who had not taken up and interred the bodies of
those who were killed and drowned in the sea-fight near the island
Arginusae; and when, upon more than one occasion, I opposed the violent
and cruel orders of the thirty tyrants. What is it then that has prevented me
from appearing in your assemblies? It is that dae∣mon, that voice divine,
which you have so often heard me mention, and Melitus has taken so much
pains to ridicule. That spirit has attached itself to me from my infancy:
it is a voice which I never hear but when it would prevent me from
persisting in something I have resolved; for it never exhorts me to
undertake any thing: it is the same being that <PB N="385" REF="390"/> has
always opposed me when I would have intermeddled in the affairs of the
republic, and that with the greatest reason; for I should have been
amongst the dead long ago had I been concerned in the measures of the
state, without effecting any thing to the advantage of myself or our
country. Do not take it ill, I beseech you, if I speak my thoughts without
disguise, and with truth and freedom. Every man who would generously
oppose a whole people, either amongst us or elsewhere, and who inflexibly
applies himself to prevent the violation of the laws, and the practice of
ini∣quity in a government, will never do so long with impunity. It is
absolutely necessary for him, who would contend for justice, if he has
any thoughts of living, to remain in a private station, and never to have any
share in public affairs.</P> 
<P>For the rest, Athenians, if, in the ex∣treme danger I now am, I do
not imitate the behaviour of those, who upon less emergencies have implored
and supplicated their judges with tears, and have brought forth their
chil∣dren, relations, and friends; it is not through pride and obstinacy, or
any contempt for you, but solely for your honour, and for that of the whole
city. You should know, that there are <PB N="386" REF="391"/> amongst our
citizens those who do not regard death as an evil, and who give that name
on∣ly to injustice and infamy. At my age, and with the reputation, true or
false, which I have, would it be consistent for me, after all the
lessons I have given upon the contempt of death, to be afraid of it
myself, and to belie in my last action all the principles and senti∣ments
of my past life?</P> 
<P>But without speaking of my fame, which I should extremely injure
by such a conduct, I do not think it allowable to intreat a judge, nor to be
absolved by supplications. He ought to be persuaded and convinced. The
judge does not sit upon the bench to shew favour, by violating the laws,
but to do jus∣tice in conforming to them. He does not swear to discharge
with impunity whom he pleases, but to do justice where it is due: we ought
not, therefore, to accustom you to per∣jury, nor you to suffer yourselves
to be ac∣customed to it; for, in so doing, both the one and the other of us
equally injure justice and religion, and both are criminals.</P> 
<P>Do not, therefore, expect from me, Athenians, that I should have
recourse amongst you to means which I believe neither honest nor lawful,
especially upon this occasion, <PB N="387" REF="392"/> wherein I am
accused of impiety by Melitus; for, if I should influence you by my
prayers, and thereby induce you to violate your oaths, it would be undeniably
evident, that I teach you not to believe in the gods; and even in defending and
justifying myself, should fur∣nish my adversaries with arms against
me, and prove that I believe no Divinity. But I am very far from such bad
thoughts: I am more convinced of the existence of God than my ac∣cusers;
and so convinced, that I abandon my∣self to God and you, that you may judge
of me as you shall deem best for yourselves and me.</P> </Q>
<P>Socrates pronounced this discourse with a firm and intrepid
tone: his air, his action, his visage, expressed nothing of the
accused; he seemed the master of his judges, from the as∣surance and
greatness of soul with which he spoke, without however losing any thing
of the modesty natural to him. But how slight soever the proofs were
against him, the fac∣tion was powerful enough to find him guilty. There was
the form of a process against him, and his irreligion was the pretence upon
which it was grounded, but his death was certainly a concerted thing. His
steady uninterrupted course of obstinate virtue, which had made 
<PB N="388" REF="393"/> him in many cases appear singular, and oppose
whatever he thought illegal or unjust, without any regard to times or
persons, had procured him a great deal of envy and ill will.</P>
<P>By his first sentence the judges only declar∣ed Socrates guilty;
but when, by his answer, he appeared to appeal from their tribunal to that of
justice and posterity; when, instead of confessing himself guilty,
he demanded re∣wards and honours from the state, the judges were so very
much offended, that they con∣demned him to drink hemlock, a method of execution
then in use amongst them.</P>
<P>Socrates received this sentence with the ut∣most composure.
Apollodorus, one of his disciples, launching out into bitter invectives and
lamentations that his master should die <HI>innocent:</HI> 
<Q REND="inline">"What," replied Socrates, with a smile, "would you
have had me die guilty? Melitus and Anytus may kill, but they can∣not hurt
me."</Q></P>
<P>After his sentence he still continued with the same serene
and intrepid aspect with which he had long enforced virtue, and held tyrants
in awe; when he entered his prison, which now became the residence of
virtue and pro∣bity, his friends followed him thither, and continued to visit
him during the interval be∣tween <PB N="389" REF="394"/> his condemnation and
death, which lasted for thirty days. The cause of that long delay was, the
Athenians sent every year a ship to the isle of Delos, to offer certain
sacri∣fices, and it was prohibited to put any person to death in the city
from the time the priest of Apollo had crowned the poop of this vessel as
a signal of its departure, till the same vessel should return; so
that sentence having been passed upon Socrates the day after that
cere∣mony began, it was necessary to defer the execution of it for thirty
days, during the con∣tinuance of this voyage.</P>
<P>In this long interval, death had sufficient opportunities to
present itself before his eyes in all its terrors, and to put his
constancy to the proof, not only by the severe rigour of a dungeon, and the
irons upon his legs, but by the continual prospect and cruel expectation of
an event of which nature is always abhorrent. In this sad condition he did
not cease to enjoy that profound tranquility of mind which his friends had
always admired in him. He en∣tertained them with the same temper he had
always expressed; and Crito observes, that the evening before his death,
he slept as peaceably as at any other time. He compos∣ed also an hymn in
honour of Apollo and <PB N="390" REF="395"/> Diana, and turned one of Aesop's
fables into verse.</P>
<P>The day before, or the same day that the ship was to arrive from
Delos, the return of which was to be followed by the death of So∣crates, Crito,
his intimate friend, came to him early in the morning to let him know that bad
news; and, at the same time, that it de∣pended only upon himself to quit
the prison; that the jailor was gained; that he would find the doors open,
and offered him a safe retreat in Thessaly. Socrates laughed at this
propo∣sal, and asked him, whither he knew any place out of Attica where
people did not die? Cri∣to urged the thing very seriously, and pressed
him to take the advantage of so precious an opportunity, adding argument upon
argu∣ment, to induce his consent, and to engage him to resolve upon his
escape: without men∣tioning the inconsolable grief he should suffer for
the death of such a friend, how should he support the reproaches of an
infinity of people, who would believe that it was in his power to have saved
him, but that he would not sacrifice a small part of his wealth for that
purpose: can the people ever be persuaded that so wise a man as
Socrates would not quit his prison when he might do it with all possible
security? <PB N="391" REF="396"/> Perhaps he might fear to expose his
friends, or to occasion the loss of their fortunes, or even of their lives
or liberty: ought there to be any thing more dear and precious to them than the
preservation of Socrates? Even strangers themselves dispute that honour
with them, many of whom have come expressly with considerable sums of
money to purchase his escape, and declare, that they should think
themselves highly honoured to receive him amongst them, and to supply him
abun∣dantly with all he should have occasion for: ought he to abandon
himself to enemies who have occasioned his being condemned unjustly, and
can he think it allowable to betray his own cause? It is not essential to
his goodness and justice to spare his fellow-citizens the guilt of
innocent blood: but if all these motives cannot alter him, and he is not
concerned in regard to himself, can he be insensible to the in∣terests
of his children? In what a condition does he leave them; and can he forget the
fa∣ther to remember only the philosopher?</P>
<P>Socrates, after having heard him with atten∣tion, praised his
zeal, and expressed his gratitude; but before he could give into his
opinion, was for examining whether it was just for him to depart out of
prison without the consent of the Athe∣nians. <PB N="392" REF="397"/> The
question therefore here is, to know whether a man condemned to die, though
unjustly, can without a crime escape from justice and the laws. Socrates
held that it was unjust; and, therefore, nobly refused to escape from
prison. He reverenced the laws of his country, and resolved to obey them in
all things, even in his death.</P>
<P>At length the fatal ship returned to Athens, which was in a manner
the signal for the death of Socrates. The next day all his friends, except
Plato, who was sick, repaired to the prison early in the morning. The
jailor de∣sired them to wait a little, because the eleven magistrates
(who had the direction of the pri∣sons) were at that time signifying to the
pri∣soner that he was to die the same day. Pre∣sently after they entered,
and found Socrates, whose chains had been taken off, sitting by Xantippe,
his wife, who held one of his children in her arms; as soon as she
per∣ceived them, setting up great cries, sobbing, and tearing her face and
hair, she made the prison resound with her complaints; Oh, my dear
Socrates! your friends are come to see you this day for the last time! He
desired she might be taken away, and she was imme∣diately carried
home.</P>
<P><PB N="393" REF="398"/> Socrates passed the rest of the day
with his friends, and discoursed with them with his usual chearfulness
and tranquility. The sub∣ject of conversation was the most important, but
adapted to the present conjuncture; that is to say, the immortality of the
soul. What gave occasion to this discourse was, a question introduced
in a manner by chance, Whether a true philosopher ought not to de∣sire, and
take pains to die? This proposition taken too literally, implied an opinion,
that a philosopher might kill himself. Socrates shews that nothing is
more unjust than this notion; and, that man appertaining to God, who formed
and placed him with his own hand in the post he possesses, cannot
abandon it without his permission, nor depart from life without his order.
What is it then that can induce a philosopher to entertain this love for
death? It can be only the hope of that happi∣ness which he expects in another
life; and that hope can be founded only upon the opinion of the soul's
immortality.</P>
<P>Socrates employed the last day of his life in entertaining his
friends upon this great and important subject; from which conversation,
Plato's admirable dialogue, intitled the Phae∣don, is wholly taken. He explains
to his <PB N="394" REF="399"/> friends all the arguments for believing the
soul immortal, and refutes all the objections against it, which are very
near the same as are made at this day.</P>
<P>When Socrates had done speaking, Crito desired him to give him,
and the rest of his friends, his last instructions in regard to his
children and other affairs, that by executing them they might have the
consolation of doing him some pleasure. I shall recommend no∣thing to
you this day, replied Socrates, more than I have already done, which is, to
take care of yourselves. You cannot do yourselves a greater service, nor
do me and my family a greater pleasure. Crito having asked him af∣terwards
in what manner he thought fit to be buried? As you please, said Socrates,
if you can lay hold of me, and I not escape out of your hands. At the same
time, looking on his friends with a smile, I can never persuade Crito, that
Socrates is he who converses with you, and disposes the several parts
of his dis∣course, for he always imagines that I am what he is going to
see dead in a little while; he confounds me with my carcase, and therefore
asks me how I would be interred. In finish∣ing these words, he rose up,
and went to bathe himself in a chamber adjoining. After he 
<PB N="395" REF="400"/> came out of the bath, his children were brought to him,
for he had three, two very little, and the other grown up. He spoke to them
for some time, gave his orders to the women who took care of them, and then
dis∣missed them. Being returned into his cham∣ber, he laid himself down
upon his bed.</P>
<P>The servant of the eleven entered at the same instant, and
having informed him that the time for drinking the hemlock was come, (which was
at sun-set) the servant was so much afflicted with sorrow, that he
turned his back and fell a-weeping. See, said Socrates, the good heart of
this man, since my impri∣sonment he has often come to see me, and to
converse with me; he is more worthy than all his fellows: how heartily the
poor man weeps for me. This is a remarkable example, and might teach those in
an office of this kind how they ought to behave to all prisoners, but more
especially to persons of merit, when they are so unhappy to fall into
their hands. The fatal cup was brought. Socrates asked what it was
necessary for him to do? Nothing more, replied the servant, than as
soon as you have drank off the draught, to walk about till you find your legs
grow weary, and afterwards lie down upon your bed. He took the cup with∣out 
<PB N="396" REF="401"/> any emotion, or change in his colour or countenance; and
regarding the man with a steady and assured look: 
<Q REND="inline">"Well, said he, what say you of this drink; may
one make a liba∣tion out of it?"</Q> Upon being told that there was only enough
for one dose: 
<Q REND="inline">"At least, con∣tinued he, we may say our prayers
to the gods, as it is our duty, and implore them to make our exit from this
world, and our last stage happy, which is what I most ardently beg of
them."</Q> After having spoke these words, he kept silence for some
time, and then drank off the whole draught with an amazing tran∣quillity and
serenity of aspect not to be ex∣pressed or conceived.</P>
<P>Till then his friends, with great violence to themselves, had
refrained from tears, but af∣ter he had drank the potion, they were no longer
their own masters, and wept abundant∣ly. Apollodorus, who had been in tears
during almost the whole conversation, began then to raise great cries,
and to lament with such excessive grief, as pierced the hearts of all
that were present. Socrates alone remained unmoved, and even reproved his
friends, tho' with his usual mildness and good nature. 
<Q REND="inline">"What are you doing? said he to them. I ad∣mire at
you! Oh! what is become of your <PB N="397" REF="402"/> virtue? Was it not for
this I sent away the women, that they might not fall into these
weaknesses; for I have always heard say that we ought to die peaceably,
and blessing the gods. Be at ease, I beg you, and shew more constancy
and resolution."</Q> He then obliged them to restrain their tears.</P>
<P>In the mean time, he kept walking to and fro; and when he found his
legs grow weary, he laid down upon his back, as he had been directed.</P>
<P>The poison then operated more and more. When Socrates sound it
began to gain up∣on the heart, uncovering his face, which had been covered,
without doubt to prevent any thing from disturbing him in his last moments,

<Q REND="inline">"Crito, said he, we owe a cock to Aesculapius;
discharge that vow for me, and pray do not forget it."</Q> Soon after which
he breathed his last. Crito went to his body, and closed his mouth and
eyes. Such was the end of So∣crates, in the first year of the ninety-fifth
Olympiad, and the seventieth of his age.</P>
<P>It was not till some time after the death of this great man, that
the people of Athens per∣ceived their mistake, and began to repent of it;
their hatred being satisfied, their preju∣dices <PB N="398" REF="403"/>
expired, and time having given them an opportunity for reflection, the
notorious in∣justice of the sentence appeared in all its hor∣rors. Nothing
was heard throughout the city but discourses in favour of Socrates. The
Academy, the Lycaeum, private houses, public walks, and market places,
seemed still to re∣echo the sound of his loved voice. 
<Q REND="inline">"Here, said they, he formed our youth, and taught
our children to love their country, and to honour their parents. In this place
he gave us his ad∣mirable lessons, and sometimes made us sea∣sonable
reproaches, to engage us more warmly in the pursuit of virtue. Alas! how have
we rewarded him for such important services?"</Q> Athens was in universal
mourning and con∣sternation. The schools were shut up, and all
exercises suspended. The accusers were call∣ed to account for the
innocent blood they had caused to be shed. Melitus was condemned to die,
and the rest banished. Plutarch observes, that all those who had any
share in this black calumny were in such abomination amongst the
citizens, that no one would give them fire, answer them any question, nor
go into the same bath with them, and had the place cleaned where they had had
bathed, lest <PB N="399" REF="404"/> they should be polluted by touching it,
which drove them into such despair, that many of them killed
themselves.</P>
<P>The Athenians, not contented with having punished his accusers,
caused a statue of brass to be erected to him, of the workmanship of
the celebrated Lysippus, and placed it in one of the most conspicuous
parts of the city. Their respect and gratitude rose even to a reli∣gious
veneration; they dedicated a chapel to him, as to a hero and a demi-god, which
they called the Chapel of Socrates.</P>
