broke by the appearance of some cot∣tages, which are distributed in

moun∣tains covered with snow; near the cottages are little groups of
evergreens; under one of the hills is a small vineyard, and, in the front, is
a kind of outhouse, where <HI>Blaise, Guillot, Renette, Jeannotte,</HI> and

with her! to be sure she is the best girl in the world if she was not
so confounded jealous; I'cod I don't know what 'tis for; I am not so
handsome, as I knows of, and then she talks of loving me so plaguely!
hang me, if one <PB N="7" REF="12"/> might not as well be hated as scolded
from morning 'till night. If I could but hit of a way to cure her of it! I was
thinking, that suppose I made love to Adelaide out of a joke; but then,
lord, she'd never listen to me; what put it in my head was, there's a mad
comical sort of a young gentleman has been plaguing me these two days to
sell him the stock that father left me, because he wants to turn
shepherd; and I have heard them say, that money is no bad thing to go a
courting with; well, we shall see, but here comes the gentleman of the

<P>No, friend, your ignorance is your protec∣tion. What! I
suppose you take me for one of the followers of the old people? if so, I
must tell you that I have the honour to be, in some sort, a companion of
the Abbé de la Mouche, famous for his elegance and taste; for his
amours, for his poetry, and for his new constructed comb for the

<P>Ho, ho, ho! Lord, that must be a comical thing! ho, ho,

<P>Ho, ho, ho! the natural! The Abbé, I say, being on a
visit at their house, came with them this way, partly in search after
their son, who we un∣derstand has taken the road to France; and partly,
like me, out of curiosity to see this wonderful creature, whose praises
they have done nothing but din in our ears ever since they saw her.</P>

<P>This, sir, is the way I happened to be in company with the
marquis and his lady, who are, by <PB N="9" REF="14"/> all that's whimsical,
the most fantastical, the most contrary, and the most ridiculous couple
that ever yoked together in the shackles of matrimony; and, as if they were
not absurd enough of themselves, they have brought with them that walking
tombstone, Count Triste, who has cried a whole fortnight for the death of a
wife, that any other man would have given half his estate to get rid of, and
who like other tomb∣stones is continually telling the world of beauties and
virtues that the deceased never possessed. But here comes the marquis
and his lady.</P>

myself a little: my rouge was so rubbed about my face, that my cheeks were
as sal∣low as the Countess of Hypocondria's, and my forehead and nose as
red as the Marquis of Burgundy's, who lives upon swallowing pint bumpers;
besides, I was struck on the way by the most beautiful idea for a

<SPEAKER>Y. B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why should you think so? 'twould be as rea∣sonable for me
to believe the same thing of you; you have the air of an inhabitant of the
woods, and yet in that estate I see you; but nature is the mother of
shepherds as well as kings; and sometimes with a light and fa∣vouring hand
bestows talents and graces on the simple and timid shepherd as the object
of her choice. The flowers which are born in the country want no cul∣ture; nor
have the birds that sing so sweetly any lessons but those of
nature.</P>

tractable hautboy longs to answer you; is this art difficult? Alas! to
explain what one feels, costs nothing: when one has sensibility and
tender∣ness to form enchanting sounds, one has only to hear you; 'twas that
struck me with admiration, and my mouth and my hautboy were inspired by my
mind.</P>

be bride∣maid.</P>

<SP>

<P>To be sure, Jeannote, one can't do less than that for old
acquaintance sake. I see she's as mad as fury, but I'll seem not to
mind it. Why now, that is as it should be; I knew all along you did not love
me, and so you know how foolish it would have been for two people to be
hampered together in a yoke, for no∣thing in the world but to draw contrary
ways.</P>

<P>Very true, Mr. Guillot; and I dares to say you'll be more
happy with a runaway vagabond creature than with an honest vartuous girl,
that's not <PB N="43" REF="48"/> ashamed to tell who her parents are; you may
take that wipe as you think proper, sir. A great credit to you, to be sure,
instead of working as an honest man ought, to be dancing about in a fool's
frock, and run∣ning after beauties.</P>

<P>Why, if I was you, Jeannotte, if I did not care for't, I would
not trouble my head about it.</P>

<P>I don't gain-say it.</P>

<P>Yes, you—you may remember when we were here before, we
used every argument in our power to induce you to go with us to Italy; and

<P>Look'e, Adelaide, I would not be thought inquisitively
impertinent; nor do I mean to seek any thing but your happiness. I tell you
my wife and I have been debating the matter all night; and, for the first
time, I believe, this seven years, we are both in one mind. In consequence
of our determina∣tion, I come to offer you my son; we are convinced your
birth is as good as ours; and as to fortune, if any <PB N="55" REF="60"/> chance
has robbed you of that, 'tis lucky my boy has a good swinging one to put in
his scale, which would otherwise be overbalanced by your merit. Confide
then to us the secret of your distress; I know before∣hand, 'tis
something that will make you more respec∣table in our eyes, for it is
impossible that any thing but goodness should dwell in such a heart
as your's.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ade.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I acknowledge that the notice you have been pleased to
take of me, is a distinction, with which I had no right to flatter myself.
I confess, also, that I ought to look upon the offer of your son, as a
very high compliment; your unparalleled kindness will never be erased from
my memory; but, Sir, there is an abyss between the world and me, that nothing
can over∣leap.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Marq.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear child, the more you humiliate yourself, the higher you
rise in my esteem; at least, let me shew you the necessity of
disclosing to us your situation, that we may know how to soften the
rigour of your fate. Consider what a terrible thing it will be to endure the
inclemency of the seasons without a friend to support, or assist
you; you'll find no more Blaises and Renettes; you'll be an object of envy to
the other villagers. Come, come, Adelaide, I have not made such a fine
speech a long time, and, pray, don't let it be in vain.</P>

<P>Sir, you shall know my story. I am now going to tell it your
son; he ought not to think of me, and I have no other way of restoring him
to himself and you, than by holding up the unfortunate circum∣stances of my
life, that he may be the first to say 'tis impossible we should ever
be united. Thus you will be acquainted with all my unhappiness; and in return
<PB N="56" REF="61"/> for this confidence, I must entreat, you, when you leave
this place, to take every possible precaution to prevent my being an object
of odious curiosity; and while you stay here, to guard me from
importunities, which are as hateful as they are ineffectual.</P>

your wishes, and every thing within my for∣tune shall be your's.</P>
