<HEAD>To the PUBLICK.</HEAD>
<P>A Paultry Collection of Songs having lately made its Appearance, to which the Pub∣lisher has, with uncommon Effrontery, prefixed my Name as the Editor, and upon my disclaiming the P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>sit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on, has even had the Assurance, in a publick Advertisement, to assert that he had my Authority for so doing;—although I have more Veneration for the Publick, than either to trouble them, or load the Daily Papers with an Altercation between a little Country Shopkeeper and a Ballad-Maker, yet I once for all beg Leave to state the real Fact.</P>
<P>About four Years ago I exhibited my LECTURE at <HI>Whitehaven,</HI> and having Occasion to use this Man's Shop, he took the Opportunity of solliciting me to give him a few Comic Songs, <Q>because he had a Mind to publish a Volume to please his Customers in the Part of the Country where he lived,</Q> and at the same Time opening a Song Book, shewed me several under my Name, which he told me he pur∣posed to print in his Collection:—My Reply was;— <Q><HI>Sir, There is not one of those printed as I wrote them; and some to which my Name is affixed are really not mine.</HI></Q>—<Q>But sir, replied my Chapman, will you please to give yourself the Trouble to mark such
<PB N="ii" REF="4"/>of them as are yours.</Q>—<Q><HI>Why really, sir, I am ashamed of them.</HI></Q>—<Q>Lord, sir, they'll do very well here; pray, sir, take the Book home, and be so obliging as to mark them for me. — And, if it would not give Mr <HI>Stevens</HI> too much Trouble, I should be greatly obliged if he would just put a Mark upon any other Songs in the Book that he thinks worth printing.</Q>—This was done, and the Volume returned the next Day.</P>
<P>From hence I could not imagine he would do <HI>more</HI> than insert my Name to the Songs I had owned; and I solemnly declare he had no Authority from me to use it otherwise. — What I did was a meer Act of common Civility;—I had not then, nor have I since had any Connections with the Man; and upon this Ground alone he has had the <HI>Modesty</HI> to charge me with a Breach of Promise by my Disavowal.— This, among other Reasons, has induced me to publish my own Songs, which I now claim as Property, and have entered in the Hall Books of the Stationers Company.</P>

<P>THE Writer of these Ballads, by way of Preface, begs leave to introduce a <HI>Fragment,</HI> which he happily met with among the MSS preserved in that inestimable receptacle of Curiosities at <HI>Chelsea,</HI> well known to the <HI>Literati</HI> of all Nations, under the denomination of DON SALTERO'S COFFEE-HOUSE.</P>
<P>This Fragment indeed bears no marks of Antiquity; yet the origin as well as progress of MUSIC and POETRY is here traced with uncommon perspi∣cuity; and it is greatly to be lamented that the Author himself could not be consulted, for putting the finishing hand to so arduous and elaborate an under∣taking.</P>

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF CHOICE SPIRITS AND BALLAD SINGING.</HEAD>
<P>JUBAL, or TUBAL CAIN, was the first composer of Tunes; his Lyre preceded <HI>Orion's, Amphion's,</HI> and even the <HI>Harp</HI> of <HI>Orpheus.</HI></P>
<P>ORION, when making his voyage upon the Dolphin's back, invented <HI>Wa∣ter Music.</HI></P>
<P>AMPHION introduced <HI>Cotillons</HI> as well as <HI>Country Dancing.</HI></P>
<P>ORPHEUS, to please his <HI>Eurydice,</HI> ex∣hibited the first <HI>Harmonic Meeting.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="7"/>And on the mountain <HI>Gibello,</HI> CIRCE held her first Court for COMUS. The Magazines of the Ancients, those most useful repositories of ready-made erudi∣tion tell us, that BACCHUS instituted a Club at this very period, called the <HI>Baccae</HI> or <HI>Bacchantes,</HI> and which are now called the BUCKS; as it appears, not only by <HI>Nimrod's</HI> ancient Charter deposited in the Archives of the <HI>Babylonian</HI> Lodge in the environs of <HI>Soho,</HI> but also by the authenticated Records belonging to the <HI>Pewter Platter</HI> in <HI>Bishopsgate-precinct.</HI></P>
<P>And to these two Bodies of that Noble and Ancient Order, the following En∣graving of the famous GOBLET, or CUP used by the GRAND BUCK at <HI>Rome,</HI> when he celebrated the <HI>Secular Games,</HI> is here addressed, with its original Inscrip∣tion, and a Translation, for the mutual entertainment of those distinct Classes of <HI>Critics,</HI> the LEARNED and UN∣LEARNED, who alternately take the lead in all Conversations.</P>

<P><PB N="7" REF="9"/>The reason for introducing this <HI>Antique</HI> unto the Reader's acquaintance is, ac∣cording to the modern custom of Book-making, to shew the <HI>Author's</HI> ERUDI∣TION; which is still farther displayed in the following account of CHOICE SPIRITS.</P>
<P>After <HI>Circe's</HI> elopement with <HI>Ulysses,</HI> they became wanderers upon the Face of the Earth, and like <HI>Jews,</HI> and <HI>Strol∣ing-players,</HI> continue <HI>Itinerants</HI> even unto this day; they have nevertheless mul∣tiplied exceedingly, propagating their Convivialities into the different <HI>Orders</HI> of GRIGS, GREGS, and GREGORIANS; —ANTIGALLICANS, FREE MASONS, and MACARONI;—SONS of SOUND SENSE and SATISFACTION;—SONS of KIT, and OLD SOULS;—TRUE BLUES, PUR∣PLES, and ALBIONS; — The BEEF STEAK, JOCKEY, and CATCH CLUBS; —The MAGDALENS, and LUMBER TROOP, with many Others; all which acknowledge the Affinity they bear to their paternal Society, by celebrating
<PB N="8" REF="10"/>their Evening Mysteries with a <HI>Song</HI> and a <HI>Sentiment.</HI></P>
<P>The CHOICE SPIRITS have ever been famous for their Talents as Musical Artists. They usually met at the har∣vest-homes of Grape-gathering: There exhilerated by the pressings of the Vin∣tage, they were wont to sing Songs, tell Stories, and shew Tricks, from their first emerging, until their Perihelion under the Presidentship of Mr. GEORGE ALEXANDER STEVENS, <HI>Ballad-Laureat</HI> to the Society of CHOICE SPIRITS, and who appeared at Ranelagh in the Cha∣racter of COMUS, supported by those Droles of merry Memory.</P>
<P>Unparalleled were their performances, as <HI>first Fists</HI> upon the SALT-BOX, and inimitable the variations they would twang upon the <HI>forte</HI> and <HI>piano</HI> JEWS-HARP. Excellent was <HI>Howard</HI> in the CHIN CONCERTO; whose Nose also supplied the melodious Tones of the BAGPIPE. — Upon the STICCADO <HI>Matt. Skeggs</HI> remains still unrivalled.—And we cannot now boast of one real
<PB N="9" REF="11"/>Genius upon the genuine HURDY GURDY.</P>
<P>Alas! these Stars are all extinguished; and the remains of ancient British Har∣mony is now confined to the manly Music of MARROW-BONES and CLEAVERS.</P>
<P>Every thing must sink into Obli∣vion; —<HI>"Corn now grows where Troy Town stood."</HI>—<HI>Ranelagh</HI> may be meta∣morphosed into a <HI>Methodist's Meeting-House! Vaux-Hall</HI> cut into <HI>Skittle-Alleys!</HI> the two Theatres converted into <HI>Auction-Rooms;</HI> and the <HI>New Pantheon</HI> become the stately Habitation of some Jew Pawn-Broker:—Nay, the SONS OF LIBERTY themselves * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *.</P>
