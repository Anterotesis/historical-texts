<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Doubt not but you will be surpriz'd to see the following Trifles ven∣ture abroad, under the Protection of your Name. I must confess, that no∣thing but the highest Confidence of your Humanity and Candour, could have emboldened me to prostrate them at your Feet, being convinc'd by the ma∣ny Instances of your Favours, of what I may modestly expect from your Goodness upon this Occasion, even your kind Reception. The best Part of the following Papers relates imme∣diately to yourself, having had their

Birth beneath your friendly Roof, and some of them their Maturity from your own Hand. Gratitude therefore, as well as prudence obliges me to make my Acknowledgment, by of∣fering them as so many Orphans, to the Shelter of your Compassion, in Hopes you will not only pardon this Assurance, but also receive them, as the best Testimony of the Respects of him who is,</P>

<HEAD>A short ESSAY on the Progress of <HI>English</HI> POETRY.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>TO <HI>Grecian</HI> Numbers <HI>Homer</HI>'s Harp was strung,</L>
<L>And <HI>Virgil</HI> triumph'd in the <HI>Latin</HI> Song;</L>
<L>But <HI>Milton</HI> on <HI>Urania</HI>'s Wings did rise,</L>
<L>And open'd wide the Curtain of the Skies;</L>
<L>By Aid Divine, Celestial Scenes he drew,</L>
<L>And brought Embattl'd Seraphs in our View;</L>
<L>A Flight so high to Mortal ne'er was given,</L>
<L>'Till <HI>Milton</HI> sung the mighty War in Heaven;</L>
<L>When with Thunder the bless'd Messiah rode,</L>
<L>Astonish'd Fiends confess'd their awful God;</L>
<L>By Force resistless, trembling Hosts he hurl'd</L>
<L>To dreadful Dungeons, of the Nether World.</L>
<L>Dismay'd in Circles, Rebel Angels fell,</L>
<L>And sunk beneath the gloomy Shades of Hell.</L>
<L>Not so feign'd Gods with ancient Giants strove,</L>
<L>When Mortals mock'd the Thunderbolts of <HI>Jove.</HI></L>
<L>Those fearful Powers from raging Monsters fled,</L>
<L>Whil'st <HI>Egypt</HI> screen'd them from the unwieldy Dread.</L>
<L>Our Sacred Bard inflam'd, by Angels fir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d,</L>
<L>On azure Wings to heav'nly Truths aspir'd:</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="5"/>What pass'd above e're this vast World began,</L>
<L>Or glittering Stars did light the Seat of Man;</L>
<L>When unborn Nature, in its Womb did sleep,</L>
<L>And sable Darkness veil'd the dusky Deep;</L>
<L>When shapeless Matter in jumbl'd Attoms lay.</L>
<L>And Hard with Soft, and Night was mix'd with Day.</L>
<L>Thus sung our <HI>English</HI> Bard in glorious Strains,</L>
<L>Whil'st more than <HI>Homer</HI>'s Stile his Song sustains.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In <HI>Cowly</HI>'s Theme the Son of <HI>Jesse</HI> shines;</L>
<L>And mourning <HI>David</HI>'s lovely in his Lines;</L>
<L>He whom God to Kingly Power did call,</L>
<L>Whose Wings preserv'd him from the Rage of <HI>Saul.</HI></L>
<L>Such pious Charms in his bright Soul did raise,</L>
<L>Which flam'd a glowing and continued Blaze.</L>
<L>Surpriz'd with Wonder, in his Songs we meet</L>
<L>A flowing Stream, and endless Source of Wit.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s Fame sweet <HI>Waller</HI>'s Lyre was strung;</L>
<L>Th' Usurper lives, because the Poet Sung.</L>
<L>His manly Notes so lofty and sublime,</L>
<L>Made hardy Treason with a Lustre shine.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When <HI>Waller</HI> did in melting Measures sing,</L>
<L>He lull'd th' Execution of a King.</L>
<L>Waller <HI>sure turn'd our</HI> English <HI>Hearts to Stone,</HI></L>
<L>When, careless of a King, and empty Throne,</L>
<L>Their harden'd Souls, remorseless did rejoice.</L>
<L>And Treason triumph'd in the publick Choice.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Our <HI>Dryden</HI> next; can we his Praise refuse,</L>
<L>In Honour of his high exalted <HI>Muse?</HI></L>
<L>To him shall future Times their Thanks express,</L>
<L>For well chose Tales, and <HI>Virgil</HI>'s <HI>English</HI> Verse.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The noble <HI>Muse</HI> of <HI>Buckhurst</HI> on her Wing,</L>
<L>Taught humble <HI>Prior</HI> in sweet Notes to sing:</L>
<L>Our ancient Bards he tuned to modern Lays;</L>
<L>To <HI>Buckhurst</HI>'s Glory, and to <HI>Prior</HI>'s Praise.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Whil'st <HI>Phoebus</HI> does his dazling Circles run,</L>
<L>Our Isle will boast the Name of <HI>Addison;</HI></L>
<L>His Numbers equal all old Poets knew,</L>
<L>In lofty Strains he far exceeds the new,</L>
<L>In his bold Scenes the <HI>Roman,</HI> Virtues shine,</L>
<L>And <HI>Cato</HI>'s Soul appears in every Line.</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="6"/>Triumphant in his Country's native Strain,</L>
<L>Paints <HI>Ros'mond</HI>'s Fate, and <HI>Marlborough</HI>'s Campaign.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Harmonious <HI>Congreve</HI> the softest <HI>Muse</HI> inspir'd;</L>
<L><HI>Congreve</HI> by all the tuneful Throng admir'd:</L>
<L>Around his Head immortal Bays shall bloom;</L>
<L>For Fame with him laments <HI>Pastora</HI>'s Gloom.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To <HI>Parnel</HI>'s Praise may every Tongue combine,</L>
<L>For flowing Sweetness, and his Songs divine:</L>
<L>In sprightly Numbers, and a melting Strain,</L>
<L>We taste the Treasures of his dulcid Vein.</L>
<L>These happy Bards did living Crowns acquire,</L>
<L>Immortal Fame transmits their glorious Fire.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The <HI>Muses</HI> still with chearful Aspects smile,</L>
<L>With verdant Laurels blooming in our Isle;</L>
<L>Since tuneful <HI>Pope</HI> his Harp from <HI>Homer</HI> strung,</L>
<L>To sound the Beauties of our copious Tongue:</L>
<L>His matchless Pen displays to vulgar View,</L>
<L>What Nature's Force, and <HI>English</HI> Words could do.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O <HI>Muse</HI> indulgent! lend an equal Strain,</L>
<L>To sing harmonious Numbers to the <HI>Dean.</HI></L>
<L>Far be the Day, when Mankind are bereft</L>
<L>Of thy bold Patriot Pen, Immortal <HI>Swift;</HI></L>
<L>For thee above some glorious Throne remains,</L>
<L>Who b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>vely broke thy Country's <HI>brazen Chains;</HI></L>
<L>And did'st with great and virtuous Courage join,</L>
<L>To baffle <HI>Wood,</HI> and sink his drossy Coin.</L>
<L>To speak thy Merit, in my humble View,</L>
<L>Thou art our <HI>Horace,</HI> and <HI>Mecenas</HI> too.</L>
<L>Let <HI>Ireland</HI> triumph in her Laurel'd Son,</L>
<L>That to his Country has such Honours done.</L>
<L>Beneath his Shade the blooming Youth appears,</L>
<L>Mature in Wit, but slender yet in Years:</L>
<L>His rising Genius and his envy'd Name,</L>
<L>Bespeak his Glory in the Rolls of Fame.</L>
<L>In groveling Numbers thus I'd fain declare,</L>
<L>The Progress of the sweet tongu'd <HI>Muses</HI> here.</L>
<L>With trembling Pinions and a feeble Quill,</L>
<L>I strove in vain to mount the sacred Hill;</L>
<L>The distant Top disturbs my aking Sight,</L>
<L>Retards my Progress, and corrects my Flight.</L>

<HEAD>On the ROTUND, erected by <HI>Mervyn Pratt,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR></HEAD>
<L>WIthin this Dome each curious Eye may view,</L>
<L>What ancient <HI>Greeks,</HI> and learned <HI>Romans</HI> knew:</L>
<L>Here Columns plac'd, in stately Order stand,</L>
<L>And proudly boast the skilful Artist's Hand;</L>
<L>Their spiral Heads <HI>Ionick</HI> Stile displays,</L>
<L>The Artist's Pride, but more the Master's Praise:</L>
<L>Their Shafts a female Comeliness express,</L>
<L>And speak the Beauties of a <HI>Grecian</HI> Dress.</L>
<L>The fretted Roof next does the Eye engage;</L>
<L>A lively Emblem of <HI>Augustus'</HI> Age;</L>
<L>When <HI>Marcus</HI> did the lofty <HI>Pantheon</HI> rear</L>
<L>For <HI>Rome</HI>'s immortal Gods, and plac'd them there.</L>
<L>A Circle here in reverend Form appears,</L>
<L>The ancient Virtue of two thousand Years;</L>
<L>Whose Name's as glorious as the rising Day,</L>
<L>Their Fame still bright'ning on the moulded Clay:</L>
<L>Hence also from their awful Busts we learn,</L>
<L>How mighty Heroes blooming Wreaths did earn:</L>
<L>How <HI>Scipio</HI> conquer'd, how <HI>Alcides</HI> fought;</L>
<L><HI>Faustina</HI> charm'd, and wise <HI>Aurelius</HI> taught.</L>
<L>Here fated <HI>Meleager</HI>'s Flame we mourn;</L>
<L>A Mother's Furies his too early Urn:</L>
<L><HI>Seneca</HI> shining in the Rolls of Fame,</L>
<L>His Precepts blast a wreched Tyrant's Name;</L>
<L>Sublime his Morals, his Reas'ning's refin'd,</L>
<L>Of Force to soften bloody <HI>Nero</HI>'s Mind.</L>
<L>The Sage in vain the fruitless Task did try,</L>
<L>And gain'd at last an easier Way to die.</L>
<L><HI>Plato</HI> divine by heavenly Ray inspir'd,</L>
<L>For Man's Instruction was so greatly fir'd.</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="8"/>Through Nature's Mists, pointed to bless'd Aboads,</L>
<L>And taught th'immortal Soul in spight of Heathen Gods:</L>
<L>These awful Busts do grace thy curious Dome,</L>
<L>Who've search'd the polish'd Stores of <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Rome.</HI></L>
<L>Here you've plac'd what ancient Story told,</L>
<L>A Treasure far more precious than their Gold.</L>
<L>O'er rugged <HI>Alps</HI> you sought the nobler Prize;</L>
<L>And courted Dangers, to become more wise:</L>
<L>Nor slightly curious did you thither go,</L>
<L>To breath new Air, or make an empty Show;</L>
<L>As many do o'er spacious Regions roam,</L>
<L>Not bringing Art, but various Vices home·</L>
<L>Not so thy virtuous Judgment thee inclin'd;</L>
<L>Their Ore you chose, but left the Dross behind.</L>
<L>Thy Skill has rear'd a Pattern in our Land,</L>
<L>Since on thy Fort we see thy <HI>Pantheon</HI> stand.</L>
<L>A lively Image of <HI>Agrippa</HI>'s Toil,</L>
<L>Appears triumphant in our Northern Soil.</L>
<L><HI>Hibernia</HI> now with joyful Pride may see,</L>
<L><HI>Vitruvian</HI> Taste, and <HI>Greek</HI> display'd by thee.</L>
<L>Accept this Tribute of an humble <HI>Muse,</HI></L>
<L>Nor do thy Praise in feeble Strains refuse.</L>

<HEAD>To a Young Gentleman of Fortune, on Commencing Holy Orders.</HEAD>
<L>SAY virtuous Youth, what does thy Mind inspire?</L>
<L>To shun the World, and from its Cares retire:</L>
<L>Scorning this frail, and transient vain Abode,</L>
<L>Inlisted in the Service of thy God.</L>
<L>The happier Choice is to thy Wishes given.</L>
<L>To be an early Voluntier for Heaven.</L>
<L>No Pomp of Life could force thee to refrain,</L>
<L>The meek <HI>Messiah</HI> and his Pilgrim's Train:</L>
<L>Beneath his Banner the Tempter to repel,</L>
<L>And snatch the Sinner from the Jaws of Hell.</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="9"/>With pious Valour wield the Ghostly Sword,</L>
<L>And conquer <HI>Satan</HI> by thy Master's Word:</L>
<L>His dread Commands do thou observe and keep,</L>
<L>And be a watchful Pastor to his Sheep;</L>
<L>Against their Foe sustain th' important Strife,</L>
<L>And to thy Flock dispense the Bread of Life.</L>
<L>Beware that they the wily Wolf withstand,</L>
<L>And feed 'em from thy consecrating Hand.</L>
<L>Let thy good Deeds a shining Lamp still burn;</L>
<L>And more by Practise than by Preaching turn.</L>
<L>Not once a Week content thy Charge to see,</L>
<L>Let all thy Life one constant Sermon be;</L>
<L>That when thy Lord shall in the Clouds appear,</L>
<L>Thy Head a Crown of Righteousness may wear:</L>
<L>And then with him in pious Joy shall boast;</L>
<L>Behold, of those you gave me none are lost.</L>
<L>Be this thy Task, let this thy Hours employ;</L>
<L>Give Sinners Comfort, and give Angels Joy.</L>
<L>In thy bless'd Function chearfully rejoice;</L>
<L>Thy Work not by Necessity but Choice.</L>
<L>A pious <HI>Atlas</HI> bear th' incumbent Load;</L>
<L>And be a Pillar in the House of God.</L>
<L>On Faith's firm Basis ever rest secure;</L>
<L>And every Shock of changing Time endure.</L>
<L>Sedate in Life's precarious Windings go,</L>
<L>Not tost by various Interests to and fro.</L>
<L>To sacred Dignities do thou aspire,</L>
<L>And be thy Master's, and thy Flock's Desire,</L>
<L>That e're thy Honours in the Dust be laid,</L>
<L>The sacred Mitre may adorn thy Head.</L>
<L>Be as a skilful Pilot on this stormy Sea,</L>
<L>To steer thy Vessel in the faithful Way;</L>
<L>That when this Life's tempestuous Course it past,</L>
<L>You may rest secure upon the wish'd for Coast.</L>

<L>And round his Bed thy Comfort send.</L>
<L>Let Health her azure Wings expand,</L>
<L>And let us greet the welcome Dove.</L>
<L>O! send that Carrier from thy Hand,</L>
<L>And all his bitter Pangs remove.</L>
<L>With earnest Wish I thus implor'd,</L>
<L>The mighty One that governs all;</L>
<L>And for thy Sake I low ador'd,</L>
<L>And for thy Ease did humbly call.</L>
<L>Let chearful Hope thy Soul inspire;</L>
<L>Let Faith sustain thy troubled Mind;</L>
<L>One contrite Tear will quench his Ire,</L>
<L>And move thy Maker to be kind·</L>
<L>No hallow'd Straws nor Bones you need,</L>
<L>No Virgin's Milk, nor Merits vain:</L>
<L>One rosy Drop which Christ did bleed,</L>

<HEAD>To a Gentleman, who promis'd his Letter of Recommendation.</HEAD>
<L>NO Court-dependant in his Corner stands,</L>

<L>No poor Cadee, impatient of a Post,</L>

<HEAD>A short Pastoral.</HEAD>
<L>REmember my <HI>Mira</HI> when I'm gone away,</L>
<L>Those pleasant sweet Arbours where once we did play;</L>
<L>Likewise the Meads, the Valleys, the Brooks,</L>
<L>Whose murmuring Streams reflected your Looks:</L>

<L>The Noons burning Rays, and the <HI>Meridian</HI> Toil,</L>

<L>'Till Evening's cool Breezes invited us forth,</L>
<L>To hear the Flocks bleating, and see the Lambs sport;</L>
<L>And smell the sweet Gales that were fann'd from each Bush,</L>
<L>To hear the Notes sung by the Lark and the Thrush:</L>
<L>Those warbling Strains that our Loves did inspire,</L>
<L>Which rung through the Grove by the feathered Quire.</L>
<L>Remember the Rivul'ts which smoothly did glide,</L>
<L>When we pass'd pleasantly by their Banks Side;</L>
<L>And you in sweet Humour would oftentimes say,</L>
<L>My Love shall as lasting, as true be as they.</L>
<L>When chearfully proffer'd and promis'd such Bliss,</L>
<L>I often embolden'd, would steal a sweet Kiss;</L>
<L>Whil'st you with a Blush, would seem to be coy,</L>
<L>And patting my Cheek, you'd call me bold Boy.</L>

<L>You tenderly led him to suckle his Dam;</L>
<L>Surpriz'd at my Presence, you seem'd much afraid,</L>
<L>And bid me begone, not injure a Maid.</L>
<L>Startl'd a little, I soon turn'd away,</L>
<L>But saw your bright Eyes invited my Stay;</L>
<L>Tempted by Beauty, your Looks and your Charms,</L>
<L>And wing'd with Desire, I flew to your Arms.</L>
<L>Where lost in Delight your Bosom I press'd;</L>
<L>But Night, Love and you can tell all the rest;</L>
<L>Remember my Charmer, remember what past,</L>

<L>Vail'd in the Vesture of our humane Frame,</L>

<L>O! he's fled, but where by Fate he's driven,</L>
<L>To <HI>Charon</HI>'s Coast or up the Road to Heaven;</L>
<L>Is now indeed a Dark mysterious Doubt,</L>
<L>There's only <HI>W—</HI> can find the Secret out;</L>
<L>But of the two I'd boldly lay a Groat,</L>
<L>His welcome Shade was wafted in the Boat;</L>
<L>What Point that lands at few or none can tell,</L>
<L>But some suspect it borders near to H—</L>
<L>If on that Coast his Fortune was to fix,</L>
<L>He's still a Dealer on the Banks of Styx;</L>
<L>And perhaps for his Judgment Skill and Care,</L>

<L>Ye <HI>Quakers</HI> all lament Friend <HI>W—e</HI> with Tears,</L>
<L>Whose Character as black is You appears:</L>
<L>Who murder'd Trade and lop'd off ev'ry Joint,</L>
<L>That us'd the Rule and Compass faithful Point;</L>
<L>But now he's gone let injur'd Workmen have,</L>
<L>One joyful Day to Dance upon his Grave;</L>
<L>Whilst I pay Tribute to his hateful Herse,</L>
<L>And sing his Actions in vindictive Verse.</L>

<L>WITHIN this Hole his Body lies,</L>

<LG>
<L>WHEN high Oppression crush'd the guilty Land'</L>
<L>And bleeding Justice claim'd the HERO's Hand;</L>
<L>When pale Religion sunk her mourning Head,</L>
<L>And glorious Liberty was almost fled.</L>
<L>No saving Arm could <HI>Albion</HI>'s Rights maintain,</L>
<L>'Till <HI>WILLIAM</HI>'s Hand soon broke the servile Chain;</L>
<L>His noble Soul <HI>Brittania</HI>'s Thrall did see,</L>
<L>Redress'd her Wrongs and bid her once be Free.</L>
<L>What lofty Trophies should glad <HI>Britons</HI> raise,</L>
<L>To <HI>NASSAU</HI>'S Glory and to virtue's Praise.</L>
<L>A Soul like His, who soar'd to deathless Fame,</L>
<L>In Deeds immortal as His sacred NAME.</L>

<L>What stately Columns should adorn the Ground,</L>
<L>Where Mighty <HI>WILLIAM</HI> felt harmless Wound;</L>
<L>Who bravely fought (thro' storming Death) His Way,</L>
<L>Repel'd the Foe and snatch'd the doubtful Day;</L>
<L>Whom Angels shielded in the sanguine Tide,</L>
