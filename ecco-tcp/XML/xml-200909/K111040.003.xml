<HI>PRIVY-COUNCIL,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>'TIS Customary with Mankind, to deem all Dedicators Flatterers,
who ra∣ther pay Court to the Fortune of their Patrons, than to any real Merit
they possess.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="4"/>But in order to avoid Cen∣sure, on Account of
this too obvious Meanness, I have hap∣pily made Choice of a Gentle∣man, to
present this last Off∣spring of my beloved Mother to, of whom, had I
Eloquence enough to say all that is good and great, the World must al∣low
'twere but barely doing Justice to his exalted Character.</P>
<P>To expatiate, Sir, on the va∣rious Points in which you excel,
would be a Task more fittly a∣dapted to the Accuracy of a <HI>Plutarch,</HI> or
the Perspicuity of a <HI>Rapin,</HI> than a Pen so unskill∣ed as mine, in
every polish'd Art.</P>
<P>Since to display your Mag∣nanimity in the Field, Wisdom 
<PB N="v" REF="5"/> in the Council, singular Polite∣ness, and universal
Benevo∣lence, demands the Flowers of Rhetorick and Poesy.</P>
<P>Yet, Sir, that you are dear to the Soldier as his Honour, to the
Publick as a Guardian, and to all who are bless'd with a Participation of
your social Hours, as a sincere Friend and most agreeable Companion, I
hope I may be allow'd to say.</P>
<P>I should never, Sir, have ar∣rived at the Honour, of draw∣ing,
even this imperfect Sketch of Sir <HI>John Ligonier,</HI> but that I retained
the Sentiments from my Mother, whose Intent it was, had she liv'd, to have
inscrib'd this Volume to you.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="6"/>In this Address, therefore, Sir, at the
same Time that I satisfy my own Ambition, I do an Action, grateful to the
Manes of a departed Mother; since, though she hated Vice, and was bold
enough to reprove it; Goodness like yours was her darling Theme.</P>
<P>I have the Honour, to be with unspeakable Respect,</P>

<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>LEST the World should imagine I publish'd this Volume, in
or∣der to displease my Father, or any other Person, the 
<PB N="viii" REF="8"/> Reflection of which, would give me the utmost
Uneasiness, I thought it quite necessary, in this Place, to declare the
Rea∣son it lay so long in Obscu∣rity; and why it is at this Time made
publick.</P>
<P>My Mother, before her Death, had taken in a Number of
Sub∣scriptions in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and after her Departure from Life, as I
was left quite destitute of Money or Friends, I was obliged to pursue the
Design of Printing the Vo∣lume; to which I was encourag∣ed, by several
Persons of real Worth and Distinction: but tho' I became indebted to the
Pub∣lick, it was never in my power, <PB N="ix" REF="9"/> to raise a
sufficient Sum to de∣fray the Expence of Printing; but on the contrary, thro'
the Resentment of those, whom my Mother had formerly describ'd, I was not
only basely traduc'd in my Reputation, but plung'd into a World of
Calamities, which I may, perhaps, at some Time hereafter relate, together
with the various Pas∣sages of my Life. However, amongst many
Accusations, that fell heavy on me, one was, that I had defrauded the
Publick, by taking Sub∣scriptions to a Work, which I not only had not a
Design of Printing, but one that never existed, except in my Imagi∣nation;
as they were kind <PB N="x" REF="10"/> enough to declare, that my Mother never
wrote such a Book.</P>
<P>Yet should I have been con∣tent, to have stood all this
Re∣proach, and much more, nay, as the Subscribers were Persons of Fortune
and Humanity, whose Contributions proceeded more from a Desire of serving
me, than a Curiosity to see the Book, I would have re∣main'd their Debtor
for ever, sooner than have brought such an Affair over; but, that having a
Wife and Family to support, and finding it impos∣sible to obtain from my
Fa∣ther the smallest Succour, <PB N="xi" REF="11"/> though I applied to him
in the most submissive and pathetick Manner: On the contrary, when I
found him endeavour∣ing to hurt me in the Opini∣on of 
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Particularly the Lord Bishop of
<HI>Derry,</HI> to whom I am much obliged.</NOTE>those, with whom I had
some Interest; I thought it but prudent, to acquit my∣self of the Charge
of Dishones∣ty, by delivering the Books to my Benefactors, and at the
same Time, to endeavour to make as much as possible by it. To this end I
came to <HI>London</HI> last <HI>October,</HI> but had not brought the
Manuscript with me, which was in the <PB N="xii" REF="12"/> Hands of Mr.
<HI>Powel,</HI> Printer in <HI>Dublin.</HI> I thought it prudent, not being
over-stocked with Cash, to try how a Subscrip∣tion would take in
<HI>London.</HI> before I ventured to pay a Sum, which was due to
<HI>Powel.</HI> I therefore printed Proposals, and communicated my Plan to
Mr. <HI>Foote,</HI> who had, when in <HI>Ire∣land,</HI> profess'd a great
Friend∣ship for me, (not without some Cause) as will be seen
hereaf∣ter. He highly approv'd my Project, and assured me I might make a
considerable Sum by it; and that for his own Part, he would get me at least
a hundred Subscribers, all which, not knowing the Gen∣tleman's 
<PB N="xiii" REF="13"/> real Disposition, I sincerely believed. His Farce
of the <HI>Englishman</HI> in <HI>Paris,</HI> was at this Time acting; and I
ventured to write the following Lines upon it, which I sent to him in a
Letter, and beg'd his Permission, to insert them in the Daily
Advertiser.

took a Quantity of them, and desired me to call in about a Week; he then
excus'd himself, by saying he had been unwell, but finally, when I
press'd him hard, he wrote me the follow∣ing polite and obliging Note.

this Volume is not in Octavo, which I at first propos'd, but was af∣terwards

<PB REF="24"/>
<HEAD>MEMOIRS OF Mrs. Letitia Pilkington.</HEAD>
<P>A Third Volume of Memoirs is really a bold Undertaking, as they
are generally light, frothy, and vain; yet I have met with such un∣hop'd
Success, that I am quite encouraged to proceed; more especially as my Word
is pass'd to the Publick; and my Word I have ever held sacred. I cannot,
like a certain Female Writer, say, I hope if I have done nothing to please,
I have done nothing to offend; for truly I mean to give both Pleasure and
Offence: Lemon and Sugar is very pretty. I should be sorry to write a
Satire which did not <PB N="2" REF="25"/> sting, nor will I ever write a
Panegyrick on an Undeserver: If a Rogue should happen to be mine honest
Friend, I owe him Silence; but that is the most he can expect.</P>
<P>Many indeed are glad to become Pur∣chasers of it. Persons whom
I know nothing of, come and beg I may not put them into the Third Volume; and
they will subscribe: Surely then they should knock at their own Hearts;
and if it confess a natural Guiltiness, 
<Q> 
<L>Let it not breathe a Thought upon their Tongue</L> 
<L>To my Dishonour—</L> 
<BIBL>Shakespear.</BIBL></Q> I threaten not any, nor did I ever
do it; but Characters are my Game, who 
<Q> 
<L>Eye Nature's Walks, shoot Folly as it flies,</L> 
<L>And catch the Manners living as they rise.</L></Q></P>
<P>I should now be glad to know how I could prosecute my own
History without intermingling that of others; I have not lived in Desarts,
where no Men abide, nor in a Cave, like <HI>Eccho</HI>; therefore it 
<PB N="3" REF="26"/> is no more in my power to grant such unreasonable
Requests, when a Book is requir'd of me, than it is in that of an
historical Painter to give a good Piece, when he is positively commanded
never to draw the Likeness of any thing in Heaven or on Earth.</P>
<P>But, Oh my dear LADIES, why are you so frightened? Why so many
Supplica∣tions to a Person unacquainted with you? Have you all then a sore
Place, which you are afraid I should touch? But now<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Taken from the Play of <HI>Pyramus</HI> and <HI>Thisbe,</HI> in
<HI>Shakespear</HI>'s <HI>Midsummer Nights Dream.</HI></NOTE>, I say this
to you, or to the same Defect: Ladies, or most fair Ladies, I would
re∣quest you not to fear, not to tremble; my Life for yours, if you think I
come as a Lion, 'twere Pity of my Life: No, no, I am no such thing; I am a
Woman, as other Women are—</P>
<P>But, after all, it does not a little sur∣prise me, that every
Person who suffers a Panick, lest their own Reputations should be
attack'd, has not a little Com∣passion for that of another: No, no! let 
<PB N="4" REF="27"/> them find a Flaw in a Brilliant, and by the Help of their
magnifying Talents, they shall dim it all over: If they look upon this as a
Virtue, 'tis one I shall never be emulous of.</P>
<P>I remember Doctor <HI>Swift</HI> told me, he once dined at a
Person's House, where the Part of the Table-Cloth, which was next to him,
happened to have a small Hole in it, which, says he, I tore as wide as I
could; then asked for some Soop, and fed myself through the Hole. The
Dean, who was a great Friend to Hous∣wifery, did this to mortify the Lady of
the House; but, upon my Word, by the general Love of Scandal and De∣traction
in <HI>Dublin,</HI> one might reasonably imagine they were all to feed
themselves through the Holes, which they had made in the Characters of
others: 
<Q>But 'tis of no Consequence to me; as Treason and Malice now
have done their worst. 
<BIBL>Shakespear.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>Reputation once gone is never to be retriev'd: The Wise say,
it is as often <PB N="5" REF="28"/> gain'd without Merit, as lost without a
Crime; so I must comfort myself the best I can. The Fable of
<HI>Reputation, Fire,</HI> and <HI>Water,</HI> is too well known to want a
Recital; and, to quote a Paragraph from a late Letter of Mr. CIBBER'S to me, in
Answer to one of mine, wherein I had acquainted him, that a Gentleman who had
formerly been prejudiced against him, was now his very sincere Admirer; as
his Lines may in some Measure be applicable to me, I shall insert them
as follows: 
<Q>It is now growing too late in Life, to be much concerned about
whatever Good or Evil the World may think it worth their while to say of me.
All I have to do, is to fix a Consciousness of my own Integrity, and then
let the Devil do his worst. Truth has a strong Arm, and in that the
weakest Person living, with an honest Heart, may trust for their
Protection.</Q></P>
<P>So let this serve by way of <HI>Preface,</HI> while I proceed in
my <HI>Narrative,</HI> or, 
<Q><PB N="6" REF="29"/> 
<L>Take the sprightly Reed, and sing and play,</L> 
<L>Careless of what the censuring World may
say.</L></Q></P>
<P>And here, before I proceed, to give Ease to every Heart, which
may possibly suffer any Anxiety, on Account of what might be said of
them, I proclaim Peace to all, but those who have directly af∣fronted me.
'Tis but a mean Piece of Cowardice to insult a Woman, and as some Gentlemen
have had the Courage to challenge me, by the known Laws of Chivalry, I have a
right to chuse the Weapons; a <HI>Pen</HI> is mine, let them take up another,
and may-hap they will meet their Match.</P>
<P>But <HI>Hibernian</HI> Writers are evermore threatened, not with
the Wit of their Antagonists, but the Arm of the Flesh; and truly that is
such a knock-down Ar∣gument, as I, at least, am utterly unable to
resist.</P>
<P>Upon my Word, were any Folly of mine to produce real Wit in
another Per∣son, <PB N="7" REF="30"/> I should not be displeased to be
roundly rallied.</P>
<P>I was very well diverted with Mr. <HI>Woodward</HI>'s<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When this Gentleman exhibited at <HI>Dublin,</HI> in Opposition
to Mr. <HI>Foote</HI>'s Tea.</NOTE> Coffee, and humorous Description of me,
crying, 
<Q> 
<L>Subscribe, or else I'll paint you like the Devil.</L></Q>
Though how I, who never either was a dramatick Writer, or a Player, came to
have such extraordinary Marks of Dis∣tinction paid me from the Theatre, is
more than I can readily account for.</P>
<P>However I enjoy'd the Jest, and the worst Mark of Resentment
I shew'd, was to send him a Crown for a Box Ticket, which he graciously
accepted; and in Re∣turn, got his Friend in the College to add six Couplets
of Scurrility to his for∣mer Encomium on me.</P>
<P>No marvel, for I remember the Dean told me, he paid a Man's Debt
on Ac∣count of his having wrote something tollerably good; and the next Proof
he gave of his Talents, as soon as he was <PB N="8" REF="31"/> releas'd from
Jail, was to write a Satire on his Benefactor and Deliverer. I told this
Passage to Mr. <HI>Cibber,</HI> who assured me he had been just
serv'd in the same Manner.</P>
<P>Gratitude is, of all Virtues, the most seldom practis'd; the
Cause of this De∣fect, I take to be our innate Pride; few Persons can bear
to be under the Weight of an Obligation, not considering that, 
<Q> 
<L>The grateful Heart by paying owes not,</L> 
<L>But stands at once indebted and discharged.</L> 
<BIBL>MILTON.</BIBL></Q> Doctor <HI>Swift</HI> very well
observes, that many Persons have done a <HI>just,</HI> many a
<HI>generous,</HI> but few a <HI>grateful</HI> Act.</P>
<P>I have indeed experienced Gratitude, even to painful Extasy;
especially, when you my dear, and honoured Lord <HI>Kings∣borough,</HI>
vouchsafe to cheer my Habita∣tion, with the Muses, Loves, and Gra∣ces in
your Train; with all the Virtues that adorn the <HI>Good,</HI> and every
shining Excellence which distinguishes the <HI>fine</HI> 
<PB N="9" REF="32"/> Gentleman: So <HI>Cyrus</HI> deigned to visit
<HI>Zoroaster,</HI> and bless his solemn Grotto.</P>
<P>You have, my Lord, another Talent, which as Leisure and Fortune
give you a Power of exerting it, I hope you will; and which, by the Honour you
have al∣lowed me, of being your Correspondent, I have discovered, and, like
a true Wo∣man, cannot bear the Pain of keeping a Secret. Amongst all the
Letters I have yet seen published, I never saw any so truly elegant,
learned, and polite, as those with which your Lordship has con∣descended
to honour your poor Servant: Invoke then, my Lord, the sacred Nine; not one
of the beauteous Virgins can be coy to such a Lover, resembling so much
their own <HI>Apollo.</HI> I am very certain they have all bestow'd their
Favours, though you are too much the Man of Honour to reveal it.</P>
<P>Let <HI>Britannia</HI> boast her <HI>Shaftesburys, Dorsets,
Mulgraves</HI>; and let us tell her in Return, we have our
<HI>Kingsborough.</HI> And here I must vindicate the Learning, as well as the
Politeness of the Nobility; <PB N="10" REF="33"/> though it be in Opposition
to Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s Opinion; who says, 
<Q> 
<L>What woeful Stuff this Madrigal would be</L> 
<L>In some starv'd Hackney Sonnetteer, or me?</L> 
<L>But let <HI>My Lord</HI> once own the happy Lines,</L> 
<L>How the Wit brightens, how the Stile refines!</L></Q> Why
sure every Person must acknow∣ledge, that while <HI>he</HI> is
insulting <HI>his</HI> Bet∣ters, his Ethic Epistles are little more than
Lord <HI>Shaftsbury</HI>'s Rhapsody be∣rhym'd; <HI>his Windsor
Forest</HI> stollen from <HI>Cooper</HI>'s <HI>Hill</HI>; and his
<HI>Eloisa</HI> and <HI>Abe∣lard,</HI> the most beautiful Lines in it,
taken from <HI>Milton</HI>'s <HI>Il Penseroso</HI>; and if I wrong his
Merit, let the Learned judge. Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> says, in his Description of
the Convent, 
<Q> 
<L>Where awful Arches, make a Noon-day Night,</L> 
<L>And the dim Windows shed a solemn Light.</L></Q> 
<Q> <PB N="11" REF="34"/><BIBL>MILTON says,</BIBL> 
<L>And story'd Windows richly dight,</L> 
<L>Shedding a dim religious Light.</L></Q> Which of these is
best, I leave to any Person of Taste to determine. 
<Q><BIBL>POPE.</BIBL> 
<L>From the full Choir when loud Hosanna's rise,</L> 
<L>And swell the Pomp of dreadful Sacrifice.</L></Q> 
<Q><BIBL> MILTON.</BIBL> 
<L>There let the pealing Organ blow,</L> 
<L>To the full-voic'd Choir below.</L> 
<L>For Service high, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></L></Q> But I forget, and
am launching into a Criticism e'er I am aware of it.</P>
<P>Now though I have held out the Olive Branch to my Friends, to whom
I would be kind, as the life-rendering Pelican; yet my Foes are not included in
the Trea∣ty. <PB N="12" REF="35"/> You, my Lady of the Fishponds and Lakes of
<HI>Lebanon,</HI> must be remem∣bered.</P>
<P>And I cannot avoid paying my Acknow∣legements to the Vice Queen of
a certain Village. <HI>Vice-Queen</HI> I term you, for the lovely 
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Lady</HI> Ann Conn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lly.</NOTE>Goddess of the Plains has
as much Humanity and Politeness as you want, and I cannot pay her a higher
Compliment; though indeed it is no wonder, as she is the Daughter of an
<HI>Eng∣lish</HI> Earl, and you derive your Pedigree from a <HI>Scotch</HI>
Pedlar; I will not name you, because you shall not take the Law of me, but
describe you I will.</P>
<P>Pray, when I sent you a Book, how came it to intitle me to an
Affront? and your civil Message, that if my third Vo∣lume was worth
reading, you would buy it at the Stationer's: Why, it will cost you a Crown
there.</P>
<P>But how long have you commenced a Judge of the Belles Lettres?
That you may be a competent one of Men, no∣body disputes; and for your
Honour, I <PB N="13" REF="36"/> believe a certain Relation of mine was pretty
intimate with it at *********.</P>
<P>And do you and your two Compani∣ons take a Frisk still, now
you are grown old! Certainly it must be as entertaining as the Witches in
<HI>Macbeth.</HI></P>
<P>Why, Madam, had I said that your Fa—r died blaspheming
the Almighty, and of the foul Disease; had I said that he refus'd to
see his Wife's Cubbs, as he call'd your Sisters, at the Hour of his Death;
had I said, that you hid Lady <HI>D—</HI> behind the Arras, to
see—Nothing—which you said, your little Tom Titmouse of a
Husband had, you cou'd not have used me worse.</P>
<P>But I scorn your low Invectives, which savour more of Malice
than of Wit; these and many other valuable Se∣crets, which I have the Honour
of know∣ing of you, shall be buried in Oblivion. 
<Q> 
<L>Stand apart now, ye <HI>Roderick Randoms,</HI></L> 
<L><HI>Foundlings,</HI> bastard Sons of Wit,</L> 
<L>Hence, ye Profane, be far away,</L> 
<L><PB N="14" REF="37"/>All ye that bow to Idol Lusts, and

<P>While I, the Cream of Historians, Mir∣ror of Poets, worthy not
only the Bays but the Laurel made for mighty Con∣querors, for my signal
Victories, pro∣ceed in my true History, which take as follows, from me the
genuine Successor of <HI>Cid Hamet,</HI> and immortal SWIFT: 
<Q> 
<L>Thus much may serve by Way of Proem,</L> 
<L>Proceed we now to Tale or Poem.</L></Q></P>
<P>ONE Day as I was sitting in my Shop,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide the 2d Vol. of these Memoirs.</NOTE> a Woman who though
very badly drest, had a Dignity in her Air which distinguish'd her from
the Vul∣gar, stood reading the Paper I had stuck up, with Regard to writing
Let∣ters and Petitions. At length she came in, and begg'd of me to write a
Petition for her, to his Majesty, from whom, as she said, she hop'd for
a Pension. I <PB N="15" REF="38"/> asked her what Title she had to it? She
said, if I could have Patience to hear her Story, she was certain I would
think she had a very just one. As I was fond of Novelties, I assured
her she could not oblige me more; so to avoid Interrup∣tion, I took her
into the Parlour, when she began her History as follows: 
<Q> 
<P> I am, said she, Grandaughter to the Marquis of
<HI>Vendosme</HI>; my Mother, whose Name was <HI>Margaretta de
Tia∣ange,</HI> was one of the most celebrated Beauties in the Court of
<HI>France.</HI> The late Electress of <HI>Hanover</HI> (poor Lady, though
her Husband was crown'd King of <HI>England,</HI> she never was
ac∣knowledg'd as Queen) had so fond an Affection for her, that she could
not think of parting with her; but when she was married, entreated she
would accompany her to <HI>Hanover</HI>; their uni∣ted Prayers prevailed on my
Grand∣father to give his Assent, and the Electress plac'd her in Quality
of the first Lady of her Bedchamber, that <PB N="16" REF="39"/> she might
ever have her near her Per∣son,—</P> 
<P> Whatever Regret my Mother felt, at the strange Difference
she found be∣tween the Court of <HI>Paris</HI> and the House of
<HI>Herenhausen,</HI> yet being happy in the Favour of her Royal
Mistress, young and chearful, she made herself quite easy; and she
and Count <HI>Con∣ningsmark</HI> used to set their Heads to∣gether, to
study what might be most amusing to the lovely Lady.</P> 
<P> But alas! while they thought only of Innocence, the Princess
<HI>Sophia,</HI> and the Dutchess of <HI>Munster,</HI> a discarded
Mistress of the <HI>Elector</HI>'s, had other Schemes in their Heads, which
not long after they put in Practice, to the Destruction of the
<HI>Count,</HI> the Disgrace of the <HI>Electress,</HI> and the
Banishment of every Person, whom she honoured with her Confidence.</P> 
<P> I have frequently heard my Mo∣ther declare, that she believ'd
there was not in the World a more virtuous Person than the Electress, and
in∣deed <PB N="17" REF="40"/> her Conduct from the Time of her Separation from
the late King, to the Hour of her Death, sufficiently convinced the World of
her unspotted Purity.</P> 
<P> Well, in the general Ruin my Mother, as her first Favourite,
was in∣evitably involv'd: She was order'd to return home to <HI>France</HI>;
and as she was a Woman of Quality, a Man of War was fitted out for that
Purpose.</P> </Q></P>
<P>I could not here avoid interrupting her, to say I wonder'd that
the Princess <HI>Sophia</HI> should enter into any Scheme which might in
the least reflect on the Honour of her own illustrious Family; she
answer'd, the Princess lov'd nothing so well as Dominion, and as the
Ladies of <HI>France</HI> had a natural Turn to Politicks, she was afraid the
Electress might inter∣fere, so as to injure her Power, which was almost
absolute. Oh! Ambition! by what cruel Means dost thou compass thy Ends? I
desired her to proceed, which she did as follows. 
<Q><PB N="18" REF="41"/> 
<P> My Mother return'd home safe, though much dejected at a
Separa∣tion from her Mistress, with whom had she been permitted, she
would willingly have embraced an Exile from the gay World. But as Time
insen∣sibly wears off Affliction, and lessens the Object, by removing
it to a greater Distance, so she began to resume her native
Chearfulness, and once more shone at Court.</P> 
<P> The first Night she appeared there, an <HI>English</HI>
Nobleman, for as such he pass'd himself, (neither did his good Mien or
Politeness, in the least con∣tradict this generally received Opini∣on) paid
his Addresses to her. Gal∣lantry and Complaisance are so much the Mode
at <HI>Paris,</HI> that my Mother took all he said of <HI>his</HI>
Passion, and <HI>her</HI> Charms, meerly as Words of Course, and told him
so; he answered that he found she was unacquainted with the Temper of the
<HI>English,</HI> who, above all other People, particularly valued
themselves on Sincerity, and scorned <PB N="19" REF="42"/> Deceit or
Hypocrisy even to the Fair, to whom most Men practise it. She answer'd,
the Ladies in his Country must certainly be very happy; he said, the most
convincing Proof he could give of the Reality of his Passion, was, that,
provided her Heart and Hand were disengaged, he would use his utmost
Endeavours to merit both. She assured him she was intirely at her
Father's Disposal, and that if he was serious in his Declaration, he
must ap∣ply to the Marquis of <HI>Vendosme.</HI> Ac∣cordingly, next Day he
paid the Mar∣quis a Visit, and brought such Cre∣dentials, of his being a
Man of For∣tune and Quality in <HI>England,</HI> that the Marquis had but one
Objection, which was an Unwillingness to part with my Mother; however, my
Father pro∣mised they would once a Year pay the Marquis a Visit: So all
Things being agreed on, the Marriage was celebra∣brated with great Pomp and
Fes∣tivity.</P> 
<P><PB N="20" REF="43"/> No sooner were the Rejoicings end∣ed,
than it was whisper'd my Father was not a Man of Quality, but an Impostor.
This greatly afflicted both the Marquis and my Mother; they mentioned it to my
Father, who as∣sured them it was a malicious Fal∣shood, rais'd by some
Persons who en∣vy'd his Happiness. As it was too late to retract what was
done, they could only hope the best. Shortly after, my Father urg'd a
Necessity of his returning to <HI>London,</HI> to which the Marquis
reluctantly consented.</P> 
<P> At <HI>Dover</HI> my Father's Chariot met them, carried them
to a very handsome House, where there were a Number of Servants in rich
Liveries, waiting the Commands of the Bride and Bride∣groom.</P> 
<P> But after all, not to hold you longer in Suspense, my
Father was a Limner; but so excellent in his Art, that he could well afford
to keep his Wife like a Man of Quality. However, as there is no Country where
Persons set <PB N="21" REF="44"/> a higher Value on noble Blood than
<HI>France</HI>; my Mother was cruelly mor∣tified to find herself imposed
upon, and fell into a deep Melancholy, which preying on the very Pith of Life,
she languish'd in a Consumption for three Years and died, leaving me and
another Daughter desolate Orphans.</P> 
<P> After this Loss, which I was too young to regret, my Father
brought in a Woman, whom it seems he had some Time kept as a Mistress,
to order his Houshold, and take care of us, which she did so well, that
at length my Father married her.</P> 
<P> Here happened a most strange Re∣verse of Fortune to us:
For no sooner did this Woman attain her Ends, than she altered her Conduct,
and from a fawning Servant, turned a haughty and despotick Tyrant. My Father
was oblig'd to turn off all his old Ser∣vants, because they did not pay
Res∣pect enough to her Ladyship, for he had the Honour of Knighthood
con∣ferred on him by King <HI>William.</HI></P> 
<P><PB N="22" REF="45"/> This Step-Dame now continually
endeavour'd to set my Father against us; till at length, wearied out with
In∣juries, I hired myself as a Servant to the Governor's Lady of <HI>St.
Christophers</HI>; and she being informed who I was, treated me with the
utmost Kindness.</P> 
<P> This unhealthful Climate soon de∣prived me of her, who with
her dying Breath, recommended me to the Care of the Governor; he called me up,
told me her Request, and kindly said, whoever was dear to her, it should
be his particular Care to protect, even for her Sake.</P> 
<P> I kneeled down by the Bedside, to bless them both for
their Goodness, my Mistress took my Hand, grasp'd it very hard, and
instantly expir'd.</P> 
<P> I fainted away, and my Master, as I was afterwards
informed, quitted the Chamber, bidding the Servants take care of the poor
Child.</P> 
<P> When the Funeral was over, and that the first Transports
of my Master's Sorrow were abated, he desired to see <PB N="23" REF="46"/>
me, and renew'd his kind Assurances of Protection and Favour to me. He made
me dine at his Table, saying, that my innocent Prattle diverted his
Melancholly; and I, studious to please him, did it so effectually, that
instead of my being his Servant, he became mine; and as he was too humane and
generous, to entertain a dishonourable Thought, he proposed Matrimony to
me, an Offer too considerable for me to reject.</P> 
<P> The Evening before the Day ap∣pointed for our Nuptials, my
dear Master, Friend, and Lover, was taken very ill, on which they were
deferred. But his Illness increasing, he thought proper to have the
Marriage Ceremo∣ny performed, made his Will, and as he had no Children, left me
all his Fortune, and died the next Day.</P> 
<P> Though I cannot say I was in Love with this Gentleman, yet
Gratitude made me a sincerely sorrowful Widow; though I was young, rich,
and, as the World said, handsome.</P> 
<P><PB N="24" REF="47"/> When my Year of Mourning ex∣pired, I had
several Matches proposed to me, of which I made Choice of the worst. He
was an <HI>Englishman,</HI> but to say the Truth had nothing but his
Person to recommend him. He was addicted to every Vice, and conse∣quently
soon squandered the plentiful Fortune I had brought him.</P> 
<P> And at last, one Day when I was abroad, he robbed the
House of every thing it contained that was valuable, and he, with a Negro
Woman Ser∣vant I had, got on board a Vessel bound for <HI>England.</HI></P>

<P> I was now plung'd into not only the Extremity of Sorrow, but
also of Want. However, being very expert at my Needle, particularly in
Em∣broidery, and also very curious in Shell Work; I set up a School, and
in∣structed young Ladies. Money is very easy to be got there, and so it
ought, for the Island is productive of nothing for the Service of Life,
nei∣ther <PB N="25" REF="48"/> Fruit nor Herbage, and conse∣quently there are no
Cattle, but what they have either from the Continent, or salted from
<HI>England.</HI></P> 
<P> Well; bad as the Place was, I lived there thirty Years after
the Departure of my second Husband, tolerably easy; till at length I
received, from an <HI>English</HI> Captain of a Ship, a Letter from the
Sister I have mentioned, who was extremely well married in <HI>Lon∣don,</HI>
and gave me a kind Invitation to come and pass the Remainder of my Life with
her.</P> 
<P> Accordingly I embraced the first Opportunity of returning
to my dear native Country; all the Ladies entreat∣ed me to stay, but finding
me deter∣mined to the contrary, they gave me signal Marks of their Favour:
Each making me a Present, and assuring me that if ever I returned, I
should be af∣fectionately received.</P> 
<P> We had a tolerable Voyage, even till we were in Sight of the
English Shore; when a furious Tempest arose, <PB N="26" REF="49"/> which
set us almost beside ourselves. The Goods were thrown over Board, so
that I lost all my Cloaths; and a few Minutes after, we struck upon a Rock,
but by God's Providence, not a Soul perished. All that I saved was a
Basket of Curiosities, such as the Island afforded.</P> 
<P> But not to detain you with trivial Circumstances, I got to
<HI>London,</HI> and went to my Sister's House, which I found hung with
black, she in her Coffin, and the Hearse ready to con∣vey her to the
Grave.</P> 
<P> This was a dreadful Disappointment to me, for I was quite a
Stranger, moneyless, and could not reasonably hope for much Favour from a
Bro∣ther-in-law, whom I had never seen, especially as the Link of the Chain
which united us, was now dissolv'd.</P> 
<P> The next Day I went to him; and, upon telling him the
Circumstances of my Life, exactly as my Sister had done, he had the
Goodness to give me <PB N="27" REF="50"/> her Cloathes; a seasonable
Relief, as my own were lost.</P> 
<P> The following Day I went into a Broker's Shop, to know if the
Person who kept it would buy some of my Merchandize: He desired me to
come in, and seemed surpris'd at the Variety and Beauty of my Collection;
and perceiving me very faint, for indeed I was all almost famish'd, he
offered me a Dram; which I refus'd, as I was sensible it must have got
the better of one so weak as I was.</P> 
<P> However, I accepted of some Toast and Ale, which, I
really think, saved my Life: After this Act of Civility I told my
Distress to him, and he kindly gave me a Lodging, and re∣commended me to
you.</P> </Q></P>
<P>I wrote a Petition for this unhappy Stranger; which had no manner
of Ef∣fect on his Majesty: I afterwards wrote to her Brother-in-law; who gave
her Five Guineas, with which Sum she again set out for <HI>St.
Christophers</HI>; and, as I after∣wards <PB N="28" REF="51"/> learne, the
Ship, with all the Pas∣sengers, were lost.</P>
<P>I think this poor Lady's Life was but a continual Scene of Storms
and Misfor∣tunes, as if Heaven had 
<Q> 
<L>Bar'd her Bosom to the Thunderstone.</L></Q></P>
<P>But alas! how shall we poor Reptiles presume to judge the Ways
of Pro∣vidence; all things are ordered with Har∣mony and Beauty; though, like a
Fly, our feeble Ray sees but an Inch around, yet dares dislike the
Structure of the Whole.</P>
<P>As well might a Mariner, in the midst of the wide World of
congregated Wa∣ters, hope, with his Line, to sound the deep Abyss, as our
finite Minds to com∣prehend the Ways of Deity. 
<Q> 
<L>Here then let us rest,</L></Q> Whatever is, is right;
Wisdom and Goodness govern all.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="52"/>Reader, have Patience with my Philo∣sophick
Whimsies, which I must some∣times indulge: 'Tis frequent, in
Con∣versation, to say, of those that are drown'd, That they are gone to
the Bottom of the Sea; but, with due Deference to better Judges, I cannot
conceive the Ocean to have any Bottom, except near the Shore. I have observed
every single Drop of Water to be an intire Globe; put an∣other to it, they
unite by Adhesion of Parts, like Quicksilver, to form a larger: Thus the
tributary Streams pour in glo∣bulous Chrysolites, to form that won∣drous
Mass of Waters, which we term the Ocean, and which, no Doubt, goes quite
through the Center of the Earth, without any middle Way to stop it.</P>
<P>I know it may be here objected, that a Ship lost on one Side
ought, by this Rule, to rise at the opposite Place: Not at all; the
Pressure of the Atmosphere is every-where equal, nor is there any such
thing as up or down in Nature: As many Stars bespread the Firmament beneath
us, as above us: As Travellers, such as have <PB N="30" REF="53"/> sailed
round the World, sufficiently evi∣dence; and did not the strong Laws of
Gravitation hold all in firm Union, the Sea, no Doubt, would tumble on our
Heads.</P>
<P>Oh! thou rever'd Spirit of NEWTON, who couldst take the
Dimension of each Planet in our Solar System, and then de∣monstrate to
us, 
<Q> 
<L>How other Planets circle other Suns.</L></Q> Giving us thereby
the most august View of that Being, who pour'd forth new Worlds to all
Eternity, and peopled the Infinity of Space: If I have err'd, through Pride, in
endeavouring to search into the Secrets of Nature, wherein I may very
possibly err; let thy honour'd Manes vouchsafe to set me right, 
<Q> 
<L>For I so much a Catholick will be,</L> 
<L>As for this once, great Saint, to pray to thee.</L> 
<BIBL>Cowley.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>I think I have scarce ever read Two better Lines than Mr. POPE's
Epitaph <PB N="31" REF="54"/> on this Prince of Philosophers, which, to prove
my regard to him as a Poet, I will insert: 
<Q> 
<L>Nature, and Nature's Laws, lay wrapt in Night,</L> 
<L>GOD said, Let <HI>Newton</HI> be, and all was
Light!</L></Q></P>
<P>His Inscription on Sir <HI>Godfrey Kneller</HI>'s Monument is as
remarkably bad as this is excellent: 
<Q> 
<L><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See
<HI>Westminster-Abbey.</HI></NOTE><HI>Kneller</HI> by Heav'n, and not a
Master, taught,</L> 
<L>Whose Art was Nature, and whose Pic∣tures Thought,</L> 
<L>When now two Ages he had snatch'd from Fate,</L> 
<L>Whate'er was beauteous, and whate'er was great,</L> 
<L>Rests crown'd with Princes, Honours, Poets, Lays,</L> 
<L>Due to his Merit, and brave Thirst of Praise,</L> 
<L><PB N="32" REF="55"/>Living, great Nature fear'd he might
out∣vie,</L> 
<L>Her Works, and dying, fears herself shall die.</L></Q> And
bad as it is, 'tis but a lean Transla∣tion from the <HI>Italian,</HI> an
enervate Lan∣guage, well adapted to the soft Warblers of it, but incapable of
manly Strength, Dignity, or Grace.</P>
<P>I always find in myself a strong Incli∣nation to Criticism,
and, if I live to finish this Volume, I shall certainly indulge it: For my
Part, let the World say what they please of Criticks, I esteem them as
very useful Members of the Common∣wealth of Learning. Whatever is well
written will stand the Test of strict Exa∣mination, ay, and of Ridicule
too; and when that is past, the Work appears like Gold from the Furnace, with
ten-fold Lustre: Therefore I fairly invite the whole Body of Criticks to
canvas my Writings; if they point out an Error I shall esteem them as
Friends, and en∣deavour to amend: If they make an in∣judicious 
<PB N="33" REF="56"/> Criticism, for some such I have seen publish'd
against me, they prove their own Ignorance, and cannot give me a greater
Triumph: I only wish I may have a <HI>Longinus,</HI> not a <HI>Zoilus,</HI>
to judge me.</P>
<P>Well now, Mrs. <HI>Pilkington,</HI> says, per∣haps, my Reader,
What, in the Name of Wonder have we to do with all this?</P>
<P>Why, truly, no more, I think, than with a Buff Jerkin, or mine
Hostess at <HI>St. Albans</HI>; but I am no Methodist either in Writing
or Religion; sometimes Irregularities please; shapeless Rock, or
hanging Precipice, present to the poe∣tick Imagination more inspiring
Dreams than could the finest Garden: Where 
<Q> 
<L>Grove nods at Grove, each Alley has a Brother,</L> 
<L>And half the Platform just reflects the other.</L></Q> I am,
in short, an Heteroclite, or irre¦gular Verb, which can never be declined, or
conjugated.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="57"/>But however, considering it was a His∣tory
of myself, I promised to the World, I now proceed in it thus:</P>
<P>Two very fine young Gentlemen, whom I did not know, came to buy
some Prints, and observing a large Book in Manuscript, open before me,
one of them demanded, Was that my Account-Book? I assured the Gentlemen, my
Re∣venue was easily cast up, and that I was but a bad Arithmetician, though
I fre∣quently dealt in Figures and Numbers.</P>
<P>This Gentleman, whom I presently after found was an Earl, by his
Com∣panions calling him by his Title, in∣sisted on seeing the Subject of
my Amusement. This was the First Vo∣lume of my Work, which when once he had
began, he went quite through with, and gave it more Applause than ever an
Author's dear Partiality to their own Offspring could possibly make me
believe it deserved.</P>
<P>However, his Lordship made a just Remark, That I was very fond
of intro∣ducing <PB N="35" REF="58"/> the Sun by way of Simile, in all my Poems,
and said, he had a Mind to cut it out where-ever he met it.</P>
<P>I told his Lordship, he would then leave my Book in the Land of
Dark∣ness, and the Shadow of Death.</P>
<P>The Earl then asked me, if I intend∣ed to print it? I said I
would, if I could get Subscribers to it, otherwise it must, like many
other valuable things, be bu∣ried in Oblivion. He gave me a Sub∣scription,
and, as it was Dinner-time, took his Leave, with a Promise of drink∣ing
Coffee with me the next Evening; when, as it was <HI>Sunday,</HI> I should be
dis∣engaged from Business; which Promise, however, he did not fulfil;
and having vainly expected him till Eight, I then went up Stairs, to sit with
the Countess of <HI>Yarmouth</HI>'s Steward's Wife; and, on my Return, found
my Shop broke open, and every Article of my Wearing Ap∣parel taken away: This
was a dreadful Mortification, and a sad Loss! All my Comfort was, that the
Thieves had taken nothing but what belonged to me.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="59"/>This Robbery quite ruin'd me, as I was obliged
to lay out my Money for Necessaries to appear decent; my Land∣lord seiz'd
for a Quarter's Rent, though he was my Countryman, and profess'd great
Friendship for me.</P>
<P>I was once more in doleful Plight; however, I got a
ready-furnish'd Lodg∣ing, just tolerable.</P>
<P>One Evening, when I came Home from a Friend's, my Landlady told
me, there was a young Woman to visit me, who wept sadly that I was abroad.
I ask'd her what sort of a Person she was? She told me, she thought
she greatly resembled me, and that she would be with me early in the
Morning: Accord∣ingly she came, and I knew her, at first Sight, to be my
Daughter: The Sur∣prize made me faint away; not but I was very glad to see
her, but Joy is over∣coming as Grief; and when I consider'd how little it was
in my Power to help her, it quite surk my Spirits. She was in a Garb which
bespoke Poverty, and gave me <PB N="37" REF="60"/> a long Account of her
Father's Inhuma∣nity to her, and his youngest Son.</P>
<P>A few Days after her Arrival came the Son I have now with me, from
on board a Privateer, as ragged as a Prodigal re∣turn'd from keeping Swine;
but, poor Child, I wonder how he subsisted at all, considering the
Hardships he had suffer'd, and what to do with them both I could not tell:
Mr. <HI>Richardson</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Author of
<HI>Clarissa.</HI></NOTE> was so kind to give my Son a new Suit of
Clothes, which put him in a Capacity of going amongst my Friends, from whom I
received a transient Relief.</P>
<P>At length the Girl, finding how Mat∣ters were, went to wait on a
Lady, and Captain <HI>Meade</HI> took my Son with him on board a Man of War,
with which a Num∣ber of Transports, and others, then went on a secret
Expedition, but were pre∣vented in their Design, by having their Intentions
betray'd to the <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P>Well, this was a little Respite to me: I heard
<HI>Worsdale</HI> was in <HI>London,</HI> and wrote to him, but receiv'd no
Answer; a Day <PB N="38" REF="61"/> or two after, as I was going through
<HI>Spring-Garden,</HI> pretty early in the Morn∣ing, who should I see but
the very iden∣tical Man, standing at a Coffee-House Door!</P>
<P>I stop'd, and look'd at him, when he immediately recollected me,
and seem'd over-joy'd to see me: He invited me to Breakfast, and told me,
he was upon his Keeping; so that he had been obliged to quit a pretty
ready-furnish'd House, he had in <HI>Mount-Street, Berkley-Square,</HI> and
leave it to the Care of a Servant, to retire to this privileg'd Place.</P>
<P>After Breakfast he desired I would write a Letter for him to
the <HI>Bavarian</HI> Ambassador, and to two others, whom I have now
forgot, to beg their Pro∣tection; which accordingly he obtain'd, though not
directly. He made me dine with him, and promised to reward me when he
should be at Liberty to pursue his Work; and, in the mean time, he said,
I should be welcome to his House in <HI>Mount-Street</HI>; an Offer which I
readily <PB N="39" REF="62"/> accepted, as well for the fine Air, as be∣ing
Rent-free.</P>
<P>He allow'd me a Shilling a Day to live on, which I could very well
do: But he came every Morning to know how much I had wrote. He would give me
Fifteen Subjects at once, and expected I should compose something
excellent on every one of them: In short, there was no End to my Labour, nor
any Relaxation from it, except sometimes a kind of troubled Sleep; for,
amongst other Mis∣fortunes, I was not able to make my Bed, nor light the
Fire; and the old Woman, his House-keeper, proud, ig∣norant, and insolent
beyond Imagina∣tion, ask'd me, Where the Devil I was bred, that I could not
sweep Rooms, light Fires, and make Beds, as well as other Servants; and that
truly Mr. <HI>Wors∣dale</HI> was a Fool to hire me, who did no∣thing but
write all Day long.</P>
<P>Though I conceiv'd a good deal of In∣dignation at being thought
the Servant of a Colour-grinder's Son, yet I could not <PB N="40" REF="63"/>
forbear laughing at the Ideas of this good Creature.</P>
<P>Never did any Soul lead a more soli∣tary Life than poor
<HI>Laetitia</HI>; for <HI>Wors∣dale</HI> had positively order'd the old
Wo∣man not to let any human Creature come near me; and she punctually obey'd
him, more out of Malice than Inte∣grity.</P>
<P>In this Sequestration from the World I wrote three Ballad
Operas, one of them plan'd on the Story of the old Song, <HI>A Pennyworth of
Wit</HI>; where I have so exalted the Wife over the Harlot, that at last,
as <HI>Worsdale</HI> is a profest Libertine, I began to think it was quite
necessary to apologize for his writing any thing to the Honour of Virtue,
or exposing of Vice; so I wrote the following Epilogue, to be spoke by a
Woman: 
<Q> 
<LG>
<HEAD>EPILOGUE to <HI>Virtue Triumphant.</HI></HEAD>
<L>DUce on't, I wonder what the Author means,</L>
<L>To pester thus the Stage with moral Scenes!</L>
<L><PB N="41" REF="64"/>The Fool! He sent me hither to

<L>Faith I'll be even with him, and abuse him.</L>
<L>I hope he listens, while I speak my Thoughts</L>
<L>And tell, what he must bear to hear, his Faults.</L>
<L>First he endeavours, in a free-born Na∣tion,</L>
<L>To bring the wearing Fetters into Fashion,</L>
<L>Nor would have loving Couples go toge∣ther,</L>
<L>Till they are yok'd by matrimonial tether.</L>
<L>Here he does plainly Liberty invade,</L>
<L>And is, besides an Enemy to Trade:</L>
<L>Should his Advice be follow'd thro' the Land,</L>
<L>What must became of <HI>Drury,</HI> and the
<HI>Strand</HI>?</L>
<L>In <HI>France,</HI> when Age appears thro' Walls of
Paint,</L>
<L>Each batter'd Jade turns Devotè, or Saint;</L>
<L>And, when her Looks no longer Love in∣spire,</L>
<L>Does wisely to a Nunnery retire:</L>
<L><PB N="42" REF="65"/>But here should pretty Females leave
off sinning,</L>
<L>What must they do? betake themselves to Spinning!</L>
<L>Why, sure, 'twou'd vex the Heart of <HI>Jew,</HI> or

<L>To see the pretty playful Creatures work.</L>
<L>Well, after all his railing thus at Harlots,</L>
<L>'Tis said, he lik'd them once, by lying Var∣lets;</L>
<L>And that, unless be perfectly had known 'em,</L>

<P>I am sorry I have not the Opera, but <HI>Worsdale</HI> was too
cunning for me, and seiz'd it, sheet by Sheet, as fast as I wrote it: And
having now Liberty, by means of the Protection, and a good deal of Work
bespoke in the City, he took a Floor near the <HI>Royal-Exchange,</HI> in a
large old-fashion'd House, with very antique Furniture; and there he gave
me a little Room to myself; but, as it was within-side of his
Painting-room, I was a Pri∣soner all the Morning, and might fast and write
till Three o'Clock in the Day; then I was called to Dinner, of Beef-steaks,
or Mutton-chops, cook'd by him∣self: The manner of our eating I must
describe.</P>
<P>We had four Play-bills laid for a Table-cloth, Knives, Forks, or
Plates, had we none; no matter for that—
<Q><PB N="44" REF="67"/> 
<L>I had a Blade,</L> 
<L>With which my tuneful Pens were made—</L> 
<L>And, so to make my Dinner sure,</L> 
<L>I for a Fork employ'd a Skewer.</L></Q> The Butter, when we
had any, was de∣posited in the cool and fragrant Recess of an old Shoe, a
Coffee-pot of mine served for as many Uses as ever <HI>Scrub</HI> had, for
sometimes it boil'd Coffee, sometimes Tea, it brought small Beer,
strong Beer, and I am more than half afraid it has been applied to less
noble Uses; but be that as it may, I've done the Man some Service, and he
knows it—No more of that.</P>
<P>He happened to paint, as he told me, the young Chevalier's
Picture, at <HI>Man∣chester.</HI> As he went to <HI>Richmond</HI> he left all
his Pictures in my Care, when, one Morning, a very beautiful young Lady, of
about Sixteen, and her Brother, a fine young Gentleman, came to the House: I
was called down, and they walk'd up Stairs; when, after a little Hesitation, 
<PB N="45" REF="68"/> the Lady ask'd me, could she see the Picture of the
Highlander? I answered, yes, and brought it to her: She kiss'd the Face,
Feet, and every Bit of it; and judging from this that she was a Roman
Catholick, a Religion that 
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lord <HI>Lucan,</HI> eldest Son to the
Earl of <HI>Kil∣malock.</HI></NOTE><HI>Patrick Sars∣field</HI>'s Neice can
never hate, let who will take Offence at it; for he was generous, noble, and
humane; and, in God's Name, let every one of his Creatures be as up∣right and
just as he, (and no Doubt but he will look down well pleas'd, and bless the
fair Variety).</P>
<P>The young Lady repeated two Lines of a Poem of Lady <HI>Mary
Wortley Mon∣tague,</HI> on seeing this Picture: 
<Q> 
<L>In ev'ry Linament of which we trace</L> 
<L>The injur'd Saint, and Royal Martyr's Face.</L></Q></P>
<P>Their Curiosity being satisfied, the Lady would have given me
some Money: I told her, I was not a Servant, but that, as I lodged in the
House, Mr. <HI>Worsdale</HI> left the Pictures in my Care: Madam, 
<PB N="46" REF="69"/> says she, I beg Pardon; but how can I make you a
Recompence for your Trou∣ble? By giving me, Madam, the Re∣mainder of the Poem:
She repeated it; and, finding I had something like Taste, she kindly
embraced me, giving me a Direction where to wait on her; and we parted, I
believe, delighted with each other; but I only speak for myself.—</P>
<P><HI>Worsdale</HI> came to Town, and called on this Lady, and
Gentleman: They were so kind to praise me highly, and ask him, who I was?
He declared he did not know; he left, he said, an old Chairwoman to look
after his House, perhaps it was she.—</P>
<P>This Answer did not satisfy them, they were so
unreasonable as to insist on it, that I was a Gentlewoman, that they knew
it by my Speech, and Hands, by my refusing Money, and begging Poetry: But
<HI>Worsdale</HI> renounced me more heartily than ever he did the Devil,
whose Ser∣vant he is.—</P>
<P>He came home very angry, abused me at an unmerciful rate, and
told me, I <PB N="47" REF="70"/> should not stay in his House, to shew
my Wit and Breeding, forsooth, when I had neither; and boast of my Family,
when it would have been better for me to have been the Daughter of a Cobler. As
this Fellow always boasted of his being Sir <HI>Godfrey Kneller</HI>'s
Bastard, I could not avoid telling him, that some People were so fond of
Family, that, to keep it up, they would prove themselves Sons of Whores.</P>
<P>The Hour of my Deliverance, from this worse than
<HI>Egyptian</HI> Bondage, now approach'd; a young Woman, for whom I had wrote
several Love-Letters to a Gentleman who had, it seems, kept her till he
married, and then forsook her, as indeed he ought, found me out.</P>
<P>The Scheme was to persuade him, that at the Time he
dismissed her, she was with Child by him, though she in Reality
confest she was never in that Circum∣stance in her Life: But, Bite the
Biter was fair enough; if he cheated her out of Innocence (a Loss never to be
retriev'd) I think she had a just Title to some of <PB N="48" REF="71"/>
his Money, of which he had more than he knew how to use.</P>
<P>I was writing a melancholy Epistle for her, when in came
<HI>Worsdale</HI>; he gave me a furious Look, and withered all my Strength
before he spoke; then he went out of the Chamber, and sent for me,
demanding of me, whether I intended to neglect his Business, and turn
Secretary for the Whores. I was really surpri∣sed, that he of all Men,
should fall so hard on kind Females; and as their Mo∣ney was honestly
earn'd by me, and they are generally liberal, I never thought I did any thing
amiss, in helping them out with a soft Epistle: He storm'd at me, she
heard him, and finding his Wrath was raised on her Account, was very much
troubled, and slipping a Guinea into my Hand softly, whispered me to come
to her House in <HI>Golden-square,</HI> and she would make me full amends
for my Vexation.—Of all Men I ever saw, <HI>W—e</HI> has the
strongest Appearance of Charity and Compassion, and the least of it
in reality. He would take any curious <PB N="49" REF="72"/> Artist out of
trouble, provided their Work, which he appropriated to himself, would yield
him ten-fold Interest. Love, Favour, or even common Decency, no Person ever
met with from him, except on terms of becoming his Slave. I have often
reflected with Wonder, on the vast Propensity that appears in Persons of
Quality, to provide for the spurious Off∣spring of Beggars, Vagrants,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> by de∣priving themselves of the Enjoyments of Life, to
amass vast Treasure, and when that tremendous Hour arrives, in which all
earthly Glories, Honours, Wealth, and Titles, cannot give a Moment's Ease, or
prolong frail Life, the Question is, 
<Q REND="inline">"How shall I dispose of this, to appease
that God, at whose Tribunal I expect shortly to appear? Oh! I'll leave it
all to the Poor."</Q>—As if the Omnipo∣tent could not see through the
shallow Device, or that his eternal Kingdom was to be purchased with their
Leavings.</P>
<P>I have observed, that most of those, who have chosen to be
publick spirited after their Death, have in their Life∣time 
<PB N="50" REF="73"/> been meer unhospitable narrow hearted Souls; and if a
Person of Birth and polite Education, had by any Mis∣fortune fallen into
Distress, and made an Application to them, such would not fail of meeting
with an Affront, and having their Letter sent back open, with the Civil
Message, that truly my Lord or my Lady did not know any Thing of it, and
had Dependants enough of their own to provide for.</P>
<P>And pray now let us enquire, who are these Poor, that the
publick and private are eternally providing for; are there not Collections
daily in Churches, besides the vast Legacies left to Parishes,
Hospitals, &amp;c. and yet to Appearance no Soul the better.</P>
<P>Are not the Streets infested with Beg∣gars of all Denominations?
and in the Houses, Objects that would raise Com∣passion in any humane,
well-judging Person?</P>
<P>Here we shall find a poor Wretch, for a few Shillings a Week,
slaving to support a Wife and Children, and perhaps <PB N="51" REF="74"/> at
the End of the Quarter, is stripped by a cruel Landlord, and torn
relentlesly from the Relief of his Family, while they are exposed to the
sharpest Pangs of Want, Cold and Nakedness.</P>
<P>And where shall they apply for Relief? if to the Parish,
perhaps they may ob∣tain a few Half-penee, but no real Suc∣cour.</P>
<P>If to a beneficent Lady, who distin∣guishes herself, by
giving a Gown once in the Year to some particular old Beg∣gar Women, and
Six-pence a Week for their Support, to give them a Taste of Life, (as the
same Woman must not ex∣pect to be serv'd two Years successively)
Why, truly my Lady <HI>Bountifull</HI> is not at home, or the Servant durst
not carry up any Letter or Petitions: So the poor Sufferer may return, loaden
with Po∣verty, and swollen with Sorrow.</P>
<P>And yet this Lady expects to be al∣most deified for her
Munificence, and Patriotism; she laid out her Money on a House, not to
satisfy her Vanity, but to employ her distressed Countrymen; 
<PB N="52" REF="75"/> she never saw the Naked, but she cloath∣ed them; nor
the Sick, but she visited them; nor the Hungry or Thirsty but she
relieved them, whilst the Rich she sent empty away. In which charitable
Opi∣nion of her own Virtues, she expects to go directly to Heaven; but now
hear the Opinion of Impartiality.</P>
<P>Indeed she never saw her Fellow Crea∣tures in Distress,
but she being of a com∣passionate Temper, found it necessary for her
own Quiet, to relieve them; there∣fore, she always chose a back Room to
sit in, that she might not view such dis∣agreeable Objects; and in
order to save her Money for some great last Stroke, if Persons of Rank
dine or sup with her, they must take such as the House affords, by
which Means the Rich are always sent empty away.</P>
<P>If no body knows this Picture, with∣out writing the Name under it,
I will confess myself to be as bad a Painter as <HI>W—e.</HI></P>
<P>Dean SWIFT's excellent Scheme for building an Hospital for
Lunaticks and <PB N="53" REF="76"/> Idiots, was of a different Cast from
those of most other Men, as it was not a Mat∣ter utter'd with his last
Breath, but stu∣died, calculated, and determined for many Years before, as
the following Lines in his Elegy on his own Death sufficiently evince. 
<Q> 
<L>He left the little Wealth he had,</L> 
<L>To build a House, for Fools and Mad,</L> 
<L>And shew'd by one Satyrick Touch,</L> 
<L>No Nation wanted it so much.</L></Q> And according to his
usual Wisdom, he committed the Regulation of it to Gen∣tlemen of real
Worth, Honour, and Pro∣bity, in which, would others follow so great, so
laudable an Example, perhaps the many Sums that were designed for good 
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mem. The Work-House in
<HI>Dublin.</HI></NOTE>Uses, but are now appropriated to the purchasing
Estates, and splendid Equipages for some particular People, might have
the wish'd Effect of being a universal Benefit.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="77"/>The <HI>Dean</HI> could not abide the thought
of being like other Mortals, forgot as soon as his venerable Dust was
convey'd to the Earth; and therefore he always endeavour'd to render himself
worthy of a grateful Remembrance in the Hearts of the People; yet how true are
his own Lines!</P>
<Q> 
<L>And now the Dean no more is miss'd,</L> 
<L>Than if he never did exist;</L> 
<L>Except amongst old-fashioned Folks,</L> 
<L>Who now and then repeat his Jokes.</L></Q>
<P>A remarkable Instance of his whimsical Disposition, which
I omitted in my first Volume, as I find 
<Q> 
<L>His sacred Name remains still dear,</L> 
<L>To every just Hibernian Ear;</L></Q> I will here insert,
and must say, 'tis with infinite Pleasure, I find that my weak Attempts
to delineate his inimitable Cha∣racter, have met with such unhoped
Ap∣probation, both here and in <HI>England</HI>; <PB N="55" REF="78"/> not so
much for the Vanity of an Author, as the Pleasure I feel at seeing so
vast a Respect paid to his Memory.</P>
<P>I believe the <HI>Dean</HI> on his first coming to
<HI>Ireland,</HI> was very melancholy, and indeed it was not to be wonder'd at,
as he was then separated from those whom he lov'd, Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> Lord
<HI>Bolingbroke,</HI> &amp;c. and in one of his Poems, he seems to despair
of meeting with Friendship in a strange Country, or that, 
<Q> 
<L>Not a Judas could be found,</L> 
<L>To sell him for three Hundred Pound.</L></Q> I one Day
ask'd him how he came to write that Poem; he told me he had three Times like
to have been hang'd, 
<Q REND="inline">"and, Pox take me, said he, but I be∣lieve the
People thought I could bring the Pretender in my Hand, and place him on the
Throne."</Q></P>
<P>I remember a worthy Gentleman, who had the Honour of his
Acquaintance, told me, that the Dean and some other Per∣sons of Taste,
whom I do not now re∣collect, <PB N="56" REF="79"/> came to a Resolution to
have a Feast once a Year, in imitation of the <HI>Saturnalia,</HI> which, in
heathen <HI>Rome,</HI> was held about the Time we keep our
<HI>Christ∣mas,</HI> whereat the Servants personated their Masters, and
the Masters waited as Servants.</P>
<P>The first Time they put this Scheme in Practice, was at the
Deanery House. When all the Servants were seated, and every Gentleman
placed behind his own Man, the Dean's Servant took an Op∣portunity of finding
Fault with some Meat that was not done to his Taste, and tak∣ing it up in
his Hand, he threw it in his Master's Face, and mimick'd him in every other
Foible which he had ever discover'd in him.</P>
<P>At this the Dean flew in a violent Rage, beat the Fellow, and put
every Thing into such Disorder, that the Servants affright∣ed, fled the
Room; and here ended the Feast of <HI>Saturnalia.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Stella,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mrs. <HI>Johnson,</HI>
said to be his own Sister.</NOTE> whom he has so beautifully praised
through his Writings, was actu∣ally <PB N="57" REF="80"/> his Wife, though they
never, I am convinced, tasted even the chaste Joys which Hymen allows.</P>
<P>It is certain, they retain'd for each other, a most tender Love;
and though they did not indulge the Desires of the Body, yet their Souls were
united by the strictest Bonds of divine and social Har∣mony.</P>
<P>He, in the latter Part of his Life, of∣fered to acknowledge her as
the Partner of his Heart; but she wisely declin'd it, knowing that while
she continued only as a Visitor, he would treat her with Res∣pect; which
would cease, as his Temper was unpassive, if she lived intirely with
him; and every Fault of his Servants would be attributed to her. I am certain
he must have tenderly loved that Lady, as I have been a Witness, that the
bare mention of her Name has drawn Tears from him, which it was not easy to
ef∣fect.</P>
<P>I remember he sent for me one Morn∣ing very early, to
Breakfast; and as I always drank Tea or Coffee, I expected 
<PB N="58" REF="81"/> to have found one of these ready; but after he had
detained me two Hours, dis∣coursing on his Houshold Oeconomy, and other
Matters, amongst which one was, that a Piece of his Garden Wall had fallen
down; and 
<Q REND="inline">"so said he,"</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"one of my Fellows forsooth, must needs get a
Trowel and Mortar, and undertake to mend the Breach.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"I happened, continued the Dean, to spy him out
of my Window at this Employment, and call'd to him to know why he did that? he
told me he had been bred a Bricklayer, and that his doing it, would save me
Mo∣ney; so I let him finish it, which he did very compleatly in about an
Hour's time. I gave him a Moidore; and Pox take me, but the Fellow instead of
going as he ought, to the Alehouse or a Whore, went and bought Silver
Buckles, and is grown very proud upon it."</Q></P>
<P>I think, Sir, said I, the Man made a good Hour's Work of it.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="82"/> 
<Q REND="inline">"Come said he, shall we go to Break∣fast, I
know you were once <HI>Bermudas</HI> mad; now I'll give you some of that
Country Cheer; <HI>open</HI> that Drawer and reach me a flat Bottle you'll find
there."</Q> I ran to obey him, and as the Drawer was low, kneeled down to
it.</P>
<P>I no sooner attempted to unlock the Drawer, but he flew at me
and beat me most immoderately; I again made an Effort, and still he beat
me, crying, 
<Q REND="inline">"Pox take you, <HI>open</HI> the Drawer."</Q> I
once more tried, and he struck me so hard, that I burst into Tears, and
said, Lord, Sir, what must I do?</P>
<P>Pox take you for a Slut, said he, 
<Q REND="inline">"would you spoil my Lock, and break my Key?"</Q>
Why, Sir the Drawer is lock'd. 
<Q REND="inline">"Oh! I beg Pardon, said he, I thought you were
going to pull it out by the Key; well, open it and do what I bid you."</Q></P>
<P>I did so, and found the Bottle. 
<Q REND="inline">"Now said he,"</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"you must know I always breakfast between my
own House and the Church, and I carry my Provision <PB N="60" REF="83"/> in
my Pocket,"</Q> upon this he pulled out a Piece of Gingerbread, and offered me
some.</P>
<P>As I was terribly afflicted with the Heart-burn, the very thoughts
of any thing so dry, made me ten times worse, which I told him, and begged
he would excuse me. He positively insisted on my eating a Piece of it,
which I was, on Penalty of another Beating, obliged to comply with.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"Now, said he, you must take a Sup out of my
Bottle."</Q> I just held it to my Mouth, and found it so strong, that I
intreated he would not ask me to taste it: He endeavoured to persuade me;
but finding that would not avail, he threw me down, forced the Bottle into my
Mouth, and pour'd some of the Liquor down my Throat, which I thought would
have set my very Stomach on Fire. He then gravely went to Prayers, and I
re∣turned home, not greatly delighted, but, however, glad to come off no
worse. I went the ensuing. Evening to pay a Vi∣sit to my Kinsman Doctor
<HI>S—ge,</HI> <PB N="61" REF="84"/> then lately consecrated Lord
B—p of ****. This Gentleman, and his Family, were extremely fond of my
Fa∣ther, and always pleased when I did my∣self the Honour to call on them;
and received me with that Ease and Polite∣ness, peculiar to well bred
People. I con∣gratulated the Bishop on his Preferment: He modestly told me,
that his Honours did not sit easy on him, and that he would willingly
dispence with his Friends not saluting him by his Title of Lord, as it
always made him uneasy. He then asked me, as he saw my Father's Cha∣riot
at the Door, where I intended to go? I told him, to the Dean. Well, said he,
I beg you'll give my Compliments to him, and tell him, That, as 'tis to his
Recommendation I owe my present Hap∣piness, I am surprised I never had
the Pleasure of seeing him since he con∣ferred so great a Favouron me:
While I was plain Doctor <HI>S—ge,</HI> continued he, the Dean used to
send his Wine and Bread before him, and frequently take a Dinner with me; but
now, I believe, he is <PB N="62" REF="85"/> asham'd to own me: Pray speak to
him, and let me know his Answer. I pro∣mised I would, and then
departed.</P>
<P>I found the Dean at home, and alone, which gave me an immediate
Opportu∣nity of delivering the B—p's Mes∣sage. He listen'd to me
very attentively, and then said, 
<Q REND="inline">"Oh, I remember some∣thing of it: L—d
<HI>C—t</HI> ap∣plied to me for a Person to make a Bishop of, whom I
knew was not an honest Man; and, as I wanted the Living of
<HI>W—b</HI>'s for <HI>D—y,</HI> I recommended <HI>S—ge</HI>
to the Bishoprick, with an Assurance, that he would answer his
Excellency's Pur∣pose; and Pox take me if I ever thought him worth my
Contempt, till I had made a Bishop of him."</Q></P>
<P>The Dean then told me, that as he had no Company, and did not know
how to dispose of his time, I should have the Honour to sup with him;
and, said he, I will give you a most kingly En∣tertainment.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="86"/>I accordingly waited, in Expectation of some
extraordinary Repast, till about Nine o'Clock, in which Interval, my Readers
may be assured, I wanted not Amusements for the Mind: However, at length,
the Cloth was laid on a small Table, and, to my great Surprize, the Servant
brought up four blue Eggs, on a China Plate: 
<Q REND="inline">"Here, Hussey, said he, is a Plover's Egg;
King <HI>William</HI> used to give Crowns apiece for them, and thought it
Prophanation in a Subject to eat one of them; as he was, amongst his other
immortal Perfections, an Epicure, a Glutton, and a—Hold, said he, I had
like to have spoken Treason: But how do you like the Eggs?"</Q> Sir, I have
eat none yet. 
<Q REND="inline">"Well, eat like a Monarch then, and tell me your
Opinion."</Q> I did eat, and told him, I had not that elevated Notion of his
Banquet, which he might possibly have, from so great a Precedent. 
<Q REND="inline">"Well, said he, these Eggs cost me Six-pence
apiece, which is a little extravagant, considering a Herring will cost but
a <PB N="64" REF="87"/> Halfpenny; but I never exceed two; and this is the only
Article in which I am luxurious."</Q></P>
<P>I must here again apologize to my Reader for my frequent
Digressions, in which, however, 'tis possible, they will find more
Entertainment than a simple Narrative will afford.</P>
<P>I believe there never was any Set of People so happy in
sincere and uninter∣rupted Friendship, as the Dean, Doctor <HI>Delany,</HI>
Mr. <HI>Pilkington,</HI> and myself; nor can I reflect, at this Hour, on any
thing with more Pleasure, than those happy Moments we have enjoyed! 'Tis
for this Reason I am fond of mentioning Matters; which bring the pleasing
Ideas to my Mind. I have observed, that the Scent of a Flower, or the Tune of
a Song, al∣ways conveys to Remembrance the exact Image of the Place in which
they were first noticed. Well, therefore, in the Relation of a Story, where
one Circum∣stance insensibly brings on another, may a Writer, who
scorns to deal in Romance, be led, like me, to digress.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="88"/>Mrs. <HI>Barber,</HI> whose Name, at her
earnest Request, I omitted in my first Volume, and who was the Lady I
mentioned to have been with me, at my first Interview with the Dean at Dr.
<HI>Delany</HI>'s Seat, was at this time writing a Volume of Poems, some of
which I fansy might, at this Day, be seen in the Cheesemongers,
Chandlers, Pastry-cooks, and Second-hand Book-sellers Shops: However, dull
as they were, they certainly would have been much worse, but that Doctor
<HI>Delany</HI> fre∣quently held what he called a <HI>Senatus Consultum,</HI>
to correct these undigested Materials; at which were present some∣times
the Dean, (in the Chair) but al∣ways Mrs. <HI>Grierson,</HI> Mr.
<HI>Pilkington,</HI> the Doctor, and myself. One Day that he had appointed
for this Purpose, we re∣ceived from him the following Lines, which, as they
contain a Compliment to me, from so eminent a Hand, I must insert: Take
notice, that as we were both diminutive in Size, Mr. <HI>Pilkington</HI> was
stiled <HI>Thomas Thumb,</HI> and I his Lady fair: 
<Q><PB N="66" REF="89"/> 
<L>Mighty <HI>Thomas,</HI> a solemn <HI>Senatus</HI> I

<L>To consult for <HI>Saphira,</HI> so come one and all;</L> 
<L>Quit Books, and quit Business, your Cure and your

<L>For a long winding Walk, and a short Bill of Fare.</L> 
<L>I've Mutton for you, Sir; and as for the Ladies,</L> 
<L>As Friend <HI>Virgil</HI> has it, I've <HI>Aliud
Mer∣cedes</HI>;</L>

<L>And for your cruel Part<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">My

<L>I have that of the Grape, which is ten times as good:</L> 
<L>Flow Wit to her Honour, flow Wine to her Health,</L>

<P><PB N="67" REF="90"/>We obeyed the Summons, and had a very elegant
Entertainment; and after∣wards proceeded to our Business, which we
completed, to the Satisfaction of all Parties.</P>
<P>Of all the Gentlemen I ever knew, this I must say, that Doctor
<HI>Delany</HI> ex∣cels in one Point particularly; which is, in giving an
elegant Entertainment, with Ease, Chearfulness, and an Hospitality, which
makes the Company happy.</P>
<P>Lord <HI>Carteret,</HI> in his Lieutenancy, be∣ing very fond of
this Gentleman, who is indeed worthy of universal Esteem, came one Day,
quite unattended, and told the Doctor he was come to dine with him. He thank'd
his Excellency for the Honour he confer'd on him, and invited him to walk into
his (beautiful) Gardens; which his Excellency did, with great good Hu∣mour.
They took a Turn or two, when the Servant came to inform them, that Dinner was
on the Table. The Doctor had generally something nice, in the Sea∣son, for
himself and his Mother, to whom he behaved with true filial Tenderness 
<PB N="68" REF="91"/> and Respect; for which, no Doubt, his Days will be long
in the Land, which the Lord hath given him.</P>
<P>The Doctor made the old Lady do the Honours of his Table; for
which, nor for the Entertainment, he never made the least Apology, but told
his Lordship, that 
<Q> 
<L>To Stomachs cloy'd with costly Fare,</L> 
<L>Simplicity alone was rare.</L></Q></P>
<P>This Demeanor of his was infinitely agreeable to Lord
<HI>C—t,</HI> who, tho' a Courtier, hated Ceremony when he sought
Pleasure, which is indeed incon∣sistent with it. And what Respect
so∣ever our Nobility may think is owing to the <HI>French</HI> Mode of
cringing and com∣plimenting, I must confess I never see it practised,
without a peculiar Pain, which I can compare to nothing but the
Appre∣hensions I am under at the Sight of Tumblers, Rope-dancers,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> such as, I believe, all rational Creatures share, at
seeing Men deform their Visages by a <PB N="69" REF="92"/> thousand
aukward Grimaces, and their Bodies like jointed Babies, only because it is
Alamode Francoise: Neither do we often see any but the most illiterate
Cox∣combs practise it.</P>
<P>His Excellency, after the Cloth was taken away and the Bottle
introduced, (when consequently, the Lady departed) told the Doctor, 
<Q REND="inline">"that he always be∣lieved him a most well-bred
Gentle∣man, but never had so clear a Demon∣stration of it, as he had this
Day seen. Others, said he, whom I have tried the same Experiment on, have
met me in as much Confusion as if I came to arrest them for High-Treason;
nay, they would not give me a Moment of their Conversation; which, and not
their Dinner, I sought, but hurry from me; and then, if I had any Appetite,
deprive me of it by their fulsome Apo∣logies for Defects. This, said his
Ex∣cellency, is like a Story I heard the Dean tell of a Lady, who had given him
an Invitation to Dinner: As she heard he was not easily pleased, she
had ta∣ken <PB N="70" REF="93"/> a Month to provide for it. When the Time came,
every Delicacy which could be purchased, the Lady had prepared, even to
Profusion, (which you know <HI>Swift</HI> hated.) However, the Dean was
scarce seated, when she began to make a ceremonious Ha∣rangue; in which
she told him, that she was sincerely sorry she had not a more
tolerable Dinner, since she was apprehensive there was not any thing
there fit for him to eat; in short, that it was a bad Dinner: <HI>Pox take
you for a B—,</HI> said the Dean, <HI>why did you not get a better?
Sure you had Time enough! but since you say it is so bad, I'll e'en go
Home and eat a Herring.</HI> Accordingly he departed, and left her justly
confused at her Folly, which had spoilt all the Pains and Expence she had
been at."</Q></P>
<P>And here, if it will not be thought im∣pertinent in me, to intrude
into such Company, I also have a Story, which I somewhere heard, not
unapplicable to the above.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="94"/>A certain <HI>English</HI> Nobleman, who had
the Honour to be sent Embassador to <HI>France,</HI> was said to be one
of the most polite accomplished fine Gentlemen in <HI>Europe.</HI> This
reached the Ears of the <HI>French</HI> King, who thought such a Cha∣racter
due to none but himself; but as every thing is proved by Trial, his
Ma∣jesty took this Method of informing his Curiosity. One Morning that the
Ambas∣sador had a private Audience, the King told him he should be glad
of his Excel∣lency's Company, to take an airing with him; the Ambassador
did not hesitate on accepting the Offer; but told his Majesty, he was ready
to wait on him; the King's Chariot was at the Door, which he very carelessly
desired the Nobleman to step into: <HI>No, Sir,</HI> replied the
Ambassador, <HI>not before your Majesty</HI>; at which the King burst
out a Laughing, and said, 
<Q REND="inline">"No, no, my Lord, you are not the best bred Man
in the World; otherwise you would have done what I desired, since you
might well know, that if it was not agreeable to me, I should ne∣ver 
<PB N="72" REF="95"/> have paid you the Compli∣ment."</Q></P>
<P>And indeed I have heard those who ought to be the best Judges
of Manners, declare, that in Company with Superiors, to act implicitly
according to their Direc∣tions, is the most effectual Method of being always
acceptable; which leads me to another little Circumstance related by Mrs.
<HI>Percival.</HI></P>
<P>This Lady, with a Company of very agreeable Persons, resolved
in the Sum∣mer-time to take a Trip to the <HI>Hague</HI>; they accordingly
set out, and landed at some Place in <HI>Holland,</HI> the Name of which I
have now forgot: However, on their first Day's Journey, they stopp'd at an
Inn to dine, and enquired what they could have to eat; they were told there was
nothing in the House but a Neck of Veal; which, tho' insufficient, they
de∣sired to be dressed, as there was not an Inn for some Miles forward;
therefore they made it up with some of their Sea Provisions, which the
Servants had for∣tunately brought in. After Dinner they <PB N="73" REF="96"/>
called a Bill, and amongst other Articles of Extortion, they were charged for
Meat One Pound Four Shillings, which was so palpable an Imposition, that
tho' each of the Company had Fortune and Liberality enough, yet they called for
the Man, and told him they absolutely would not pay so extravagant a Price;
sooner than which, as they came meerly for Pleasure, they would stay a
Month and spend a hundred Pounds a Piece in Law; the Boorish Fellow told
them that it was the common Price in this Place; which if they doubted, he was
willing to ap∣peal to the Magistrate. This they rea∣dily agreed to, and were
all preparing for a serious Trial of the Matter, when Minheer told them, in
an ironical Tone, that he was himself the Ruling-Officer and Dispenser of
Law and Justice in that Place. Finding this to be the Fact, and that the
Defendant must be the Judge in this Cause, the Plaintiffs thought proper to
submit, and pay'd him.</P>
<P>If the Reader thinks this little Narra∣tive is not quite in Point;
which, now it is related, I begin to find out myself, <PB N="74" REF="97"/> he
may blot it out of his Book if he pleases, but he shall not blot it out of
my Manuscript, for that would be to de∣prive me of a Page, that is worth a
Crown to me: Nay, and as it is <HI>Truth,</HI> who knows but it may prove worth
two Crowns to the Reader, if he should hap∣pen to make the same Tour.</P>
<P>My dear Mr. <HI>Cibber,</HI> to whom, for his Amusement, I
used to relate such little Incidents, would frequently admire what a Fund
of Matter for Entertainment my Brain contained, and he bad me write it all;
since, if it pleased him, it might possibly have the same Effect on
others. This Gentleman's frequent Con∣versation with the Great, gave him a
bet∣ter Opportunity of knowing their Dispo∣sition (as he had infinite
Penetration) than most others: In Consequence of which, he advised me,
when I ever had Occasion to sollicit a Favour from any Persons of
Distinction, to take Care to Time it properly; for Instance, said he,
"Never write to him or her, of a dark foggy frosty Morning; particularly
be∣fore Breakfast, at which Time it is Ten <PB N="75" REF="98"/> to One, they
are out of Temper; nor though you send at any Time, and even received an
unmannerly Answer, do not let a rash Pride drive you to return the Affront,
since it is impossible for you to know what at that Instant had
chagrin'd their Temper. He who will not be your Friend at one Time, may at
another; and tho' you never can bring him to do you any Service, yet do not
provoke him to be your Enemy; a Man may have had ill Success at Play,
missed an Appointment with a fine Woman, or twenty such Accidents; which
may for the present sour his Disposition; whereas if you continue your
Assiduities, in Pro∣cess of Time he might do you more Service than you
could hope. These are Truths which I have since experienced, and I should
be wanting in Gratitude as well as Sincerity, if I did not make it publick.
Here follows an Instance.</P>
<P><HI>Nicholas Loftus Hume,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> whom I mentioned
in my second Volume, that came to see me in <HI>London,</HI> but declined
subscribing to me, because he was going to the Duke of
<HI>Dorsel</HI>'s to Dinner, has <PB N="76" REF="99"/> since my being in
this Kingdom, been kind enough to send me Five Guineas as a Subscription;
for which I rest his most obliged Servant.</P>
<P>I remark'd to Mr. <HI>Cibber,</HI> upon this Conversation, that
though the <HI>English</HI> Nobility were outdone by none in Mu∣nificence and
Liberality; yet I could by no Means conceive, that their Buildings were the
least expressive of it; since there was scarcely one fine House in
<HI>London,</HI> which was not obscured by a monstrous high Wall, that
intirely intercepted the Prospect, and took much from the Mag∣nificence the
Streets might possibly have. He told me, it was the Method in
<HI>Italy,</HI> from whence our Peers, and others, trans∣planted it as a
great Beauty, because the Surprise has a vast Effect. Sir, said I, in
<HI>Italy</HI> those Walls are requisite, to keep off the extreme Heat of
the Sun; and if possible to shut out the Eye of God from their abominable
Pollutions; but as we enjoy a mild and temperate Region, and are I hope,
untainted with their beastly Vices, I see no Reason for our Peers to
affect it; there is besides, generally at <PB N="77" REF="100"/> these
Gates, a most avaricious Cerberus, who, should a Stranger happen to stand
and gaze at any occasion of the Gates being opened, would very judiciously
slap it in their Faces, as if our Eyes, like the Sphynx of <HI>Egypt,</HI>
could penetrate Stone Walls. If you have the smallest Suit to make to his
Master, the Fellow will be as dull of Apprehension as the Mock Doctor, till
you tip him the Symp∣toms; which when you have given him, he prevails on the
Valet to deliver it, which must also be accompanied by a Daub in the
Fist. I have computed the Expence of Writing to a Great Man, as under,

<P><PB N="78" REF="101"/>These Observations I thought proper to
communicate, as I am persuaded some of the Nobility of <HI>England,</HI>
will be cu∣rious enough to read this Work, and I do assure them, nothing
so much dims their Lustre, as the Arrogance and Pe∣nury of their
Vassals; which, when they know, perhaps they may reclaim. Dean
<HI>Swift</HI> discharged a Servant only for rejecting the Petition of a poor
old Wo∣man; she was very ancient, and on a cold Morning, sat at the Deanery
Steps a con∣siderable Time, during which the Dean saw her through a Window,
and no doubt commiserated her desolate Condi∣tion. His Footman happened to
come to the Door, and the poor Creature be∣sought him in a piteous Tone, to
give that Paper to his Reverence. The Ser∣vant read it, and told her with
infinite Scorn, his Master had something else to mind than her Petition. 
<Q REND="inline">"What's that you say, Fellow, said the Dean,
look∣ing out at the Window, come up here.'</Q> <PB N="79" REF="102"/> The Man
trembling obey'd him: he also desired the poor Woman to come before him,
made her sit down, and ordered her some Bread and Wine; after which he
turned to the Man, and said, 
<Q REND="inline">"At what time, Sir, did I order you to open a
Paper directed to me? or to refuse a Letter from any one? Hark ye, Sirrah,
you have been admonish'd by me for Drunkenness, idling, and other Faults,
but since I have discovered your inhuman Disposition, I must
dis∣miss you from my Service: So pull off my Cloaths, take your Wages, and
let me hear no more of you."</Q>—The Fellow did so, and having vainly
sollicited a Discharge, was compelled to go to Sea, where he continued five
Years; at the end of which time, finding that Life far different from the
Ease and Luxury of his former Occupation, he re∣turned, and humbly
confessing, in a Pe∣tition to the Dean, his former manifold Crimes; he
assured him of his sincere Reformation, which the Dangers he had 
<PB N="80" REF="103"/> undergone at Sea, had happily wrought, and begg'd the
Dean would give him some Sort of Discharge, since the Ho∣nour of having
liv'd with him, would certainly procure him a Place. Accord∣ingly, the Dean
call'd for Pen, Ink and Paper, and gave him a Dismission, with which, and
no other Fortune, he set out for London.</P>
<P>Among others he applied to me, who had known him at his late
Master's, and produc'd his Certificate; which for its Singularity, I
transcribed, and believe it may not be displeasing to the Reader. 
<LETTER>
<P>Whereas the Bearer—serv'd me the Space of one Year,
during which time he was an Idler and a Drun∣kard, I then discharged him as
such; but how far his having been five Years at Sea, may have mended his
Manners, I leave to the Penetration of those who may hereafter chuse to
employ him.</P>

<P><PB N="81" REF="104"/>I advised him to go to Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI>
who, on seeing the Dean's Hand-writing, which he well knew, told the Man, if
he could produce any credible Person, who would attest, that he was the
Servant that the Dean meant, he would hire him. On this Occasion he applied
to me, and I gave him a Letter to Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> assuring him, that I
knew the Man to have been Footman to the Dean. Upon this Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> took
him into his Service, in which he continued till the Death of his Master.</P>
<P>'Tis now, I think, full time for me to take up my Clue, and go on
with my Memoirs; previous to which it is, how∣ever, I think, it incumbent on
me, to in∣treat my Readers Forgiveness for my so frequently mentioning, in
the Prosecution of my Story, a Person so contemptible, so unworthy even
of Satire, as one <HI>Worf∣dale,</HI> a Painter; yet those who examine
these Writings will find, that he is so unluckily interweven in my
History, that it is as impossible for me to eradicate him, as it was for
Jack, in the Tale of <PB N="82" REF="105"/> a Tub, to strip his Coat of its
Foppe∣ries, without visibly defacing the whole.</P>
<P><HI>Worsdale</HI> went abroad, and I took an Opportunity to make
my Escape, to visit Mr. <HI>Cibber,</HI> and met, according to Cu∣stom, a
very kind Reception: For his Friendship to me was inviolable. He was writing
the <HI>Character and Conduct of</HI> CICERO consider'd; and did me the
Honour to read it to me: I was infinitely pleased to find, by the many lively
Sal∣lies of Wit in it, that the good Gentle∣man's Spirits were undepress'd
with Years;—Long may they continue so. This gave me an Opportunity of
writing a Poem to him, which <HI>W—e</HI> had the Confidence to ask
from me; but I did not chuse to compliment him with it: [The Editor has
applied to Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI> for a Copy of this Poem, but he having
disposed of them all, we are obliged to omit it].</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI> was exceeding well pleas'd when I waited on
him with it, and said, he would give it a Place, but that it wanted
Correction, which he promised to bestow on it: This I readily agreed to, 
<PB N="83" REF="106"/> being convinced his Judgment far sur∣passed
mine.</P>
<P>I waited on him next Morning, and found he had greatly improved my
Work: I thank'd him for his obliging Pains, but remarked his Modesty in
having struck out some Lines, in which he was most praised.</P>
<P>Well, Madam, said he, there are two Guineas for your Flattery,
and one more for the Liberty I took. I blessed my Benefactor sincerely,
from my Soul; he smiled benevolent: 
<Q REND="inline">"Come, said he, I have more good News for you;
Mr. <HI>Stanhope</HI> alter'd a Line, for which he desires you will accept of
a Guinea: Mr. <HI>Hervey</HI> also pays you the same Compliment, for
changing one Mo∣nosyllable for another:"</Q> To say the Truth, I only
wished every Gentleman at <HI>White</HI>'s had, on the same Terms, taken
the same Liberty, till my Work, like Admiral <HI>Drake</HI>'s Ship, had been
so often mended, that not a Bit of the original Stuff it was compos'd of,
should remain; for 
<Q><PB N="84" REF="107"/> 
<L>Here, in nice Balance, Truth with Gold she weighs,</L> 
<L>And solid Pudding, against empty Praise.</L></Q></P>
<P>I could do no more than (after some joyful Tears) to assure
Mr. <HI>Cibber,</HI> that neither his own Favours to me, nor those he had
sollicited for me, should ever be forgot, while this poor Machine of mine
had any Existence.</P>

<P>What strange things are thought; and Reflections, how do they
wander? Who <PB N="85" REF="108"/> but the Almighty can account for them? I
went, when in <HI>London,</HI> to be electrified, when finding the Motion given
to a glass Globe not only made Sparks of Fire come out of my Arm, but also
set a Bowl of Sand under it a boiling, I could not help thinking, that the
Earth revolving each Day on its own Axis, must of course take Fire, as I
have seen a Chariot-wheel do: Our Globe may then become a Comet, and the
Inhabitants of others gaze on it with Surprize and Admiration. I think no
Philosopher has yet been able to tell us, by all their mathematical Rules,
what Comets are. I have been told many Stars, which once adorn'd the blue
etherial Space, have disappear'd; Worlds perhaps lost in a Conflagration,
which no more fill the wide Expanse.</P>

<P>Reader, excuse me; if you are a Man of Sense I am certain you

<P>Had I stray'd from the Paths of Vir∣tue, when turn'd out
desolate to the wide World, forsaken by all my once dear seeming Friends,
and tender Relatives, I might at least have hoped for Pity, and given
Necessity as a Plea for Error: This has made me so circumstantial in

I have many Friends, and those such as would be an Honour to any Person

<P>But to return: I was now able to quit my Confinement; for
<HI>Worsdale</HI> made his House a severe one to me: Oh how I rejoiced at
my Deliverance, and took a little decent Lodging; but my Joys were perishable
as the baseless Fabrick of a Vision: Captain <HI>Meade,</HI> with whom I
mentioned my Son's going on the secret <PB N="90" REF="113"/> Expedition, came
to tell me, that the Boy and he landed the Day before; that my Son was seized
with all the Symptoms of a violent Fever, and wanted to see me. I went to the
Captain's Lodgings, in <HI>Scotland-Yard,</HI> and found my poor Wan∣derer
quite light-headed. The Captain sent a Physician and a Surgeon to him, with
Orders to the Mistress of the House to provide for him whatever was
neces∣sary, and he would answer the Expence For many Days we despair'd
of his Life, till at length God's Mercy restor'd him to my Prayers and Tears.
When he came perfectly to himself he told me, they had been in a violent
Tempest, where, the Waves rolling Mountains high, he was wet to his Skin, and
the Ship in imminent Danger of being lost: Captain <HI>Meade,</HI> he said,
begged of God, that he might just see his Wife and Children, and then he
should die without the smallest Re∣luctance; his Prayer was heard, the
Storm abated, and all got safe on Shore.</P>
<P>As he was impatient to see his Family, he had left Directions
for my Son to fol∣low <PB N="91" REF="114"/> him to <HI>Teddington,</HI> if it
pleased God he recover'd. As I knew nothing could be a greater Restorative,
after a Fit of Sickness, than a pure Air, I recommend∣ed that sovereign
Elixir to him: He went the Moment he was able, and sent me the next Day the

his incestu∣ous infernal Fire, that she fled to her younger Brother, who
was an Apothe∣cary, and lived at <HI>W—d—r.</HI></P>
<P>As he was a Batchelor, he was very glad of her, to over-see his
domestick Af∣fairs, which, I dare say, she did very well, as she was a
good Housewife, especially in the frugal Part of Management: It happened
another Apothecary fell in love with her, but nothing could prevail on her to
accept of him as a Husband, tho' her Brother tried every Art he could to
persuade her to it.</P>
<P>Things were in this Situation when Captain <HI>Mead</HI> was
commanded on Duty to <HI>W—d—r,</HI> and as he had often been
there, was well acquainted with the Town, and as well esteem'd: Miss
<HI>Wh—f—d</HI> and her Brother, with some young Ladies, were
walking on the Terrass, <PB N="94" REF="117"/> when Captain <HI>Meade</HI>
accosted them. They fell into Chat, and Mr. <HI>Wh—f—ld</HI>
invited the Captain to Supper; after which the young Lady retir'd.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Wh—f—ld</HI> then acquainted the Captain with
his Sister's obstinate Refusal of an advantageous Match. 
<Q REND="inline">"She has,</Q> said he, 
<Q REND="inline">"seem'd to pay a particular Deference to every
Word you spoke to-night, and, I am certain, if you undertake the Lover's
Cause, you will bring my Sister to Reason."</Q></P>
<P>The Captain said it would be too abrupt to pretend to advise a
Lady he had never seen before, in so delicate a Point as that of Matrimony,
wherein many Circumstances ought to be con∣sidered, in order to a Union
firm and lasting. It may be, said he, the young Lady's Heart is
pre-engaged; in that Case, how cruel would it be to force her into a hateful
Wedlock, the Consequence of which is Misery?</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Wh—f—ld</HI> then assured him, he had no
such Intention, all he aimed at was her Happiness: 
<Q REND="inline">"Cultivate, added he, <PB N="95" REF="118"/> a
Friendship with her; you may easily do it, and discover the true Cause
of her Aversion toward an honest good Man, who loves her, and is in
Cir∣cumstances to maintain her in Ease and Plenty."</Q></P>
<P>Captain <HI>Mead</HI> promised all in his Power, and when, by
frequenting the House, he had got into a little Intimacy with her, he in a
paternal Stile, when they were alone, expostulated with her, to no
pur∣pose: She said, she was determined never to marry, as she was
certain she should never have the Man she only could love.</P>
<P>He pressed very hard to know who it was; assuring her of
his Friendship; and, at the same time, laying hold of her Hand, said, he
must be insensible indeed, who did not, above all other Considera∣tion,
regard so much Tenderness and Beauty.</P>
<P>He perceiv'd she trembled, blush'd, and seem'd quite
confounded: 
<Q REND="inline">"Would to God, Madam, said he, that I was the
happy Occasion of all those tender Emotions which swell your fair
Bo∣som, <PB N="96" REF="119"/> how blest should I think my∣self?"</Q>
And are you, said she, in a fault'ring Voice, are you in earnest, or do
you only trifle with a Weakness, which your Penetration must have
observed, even from the first Moment I beheld you?</P>
<P>Altho' this Declaration was very plain, yet it was so
unexpected, that the Cap∣tain was for some Moments at a Loss how to make a
suitable Return: But, recovering himself, he told her, Joy had made him
speechless, but from that Hour he was intirely devoted to her for Life.</P>
<P>He then ask'd her in Marriage of her Brother, who absolutely
refused her to him, on account of his being in the Army.</P>
<P>But as the Lady was willing to be the kind Companion of his
Flight, he hired a Chariot and Six, and took her with him.</P>
<P>This Story Captain <HI>Meade</HI> told me before her: Nor did
she in the least at∣tempt to deny it; but said, she had 
<PB N="97" REF="120"/> gain'd a good Husband by her Since∣rity.</P>
<P>Indeed, while I was with them, they seemed to me perfect
Patterns of conju∣gal Love; but her Fondness seem'd to surpass all
things, for she would kiss her Husband's Linen, saying, they smelt of
Violets and Roses; but truly, though I lov'd my dear Relation very well, I
was grown so delicate I did not like a <HI>dirty</HI> Shirt (for that was
sometimes the Case) to be offered to me as a Nosegay.</P>
<P>Her Piety was so great, that <HI>Whitsunday</HI> Morning, when
we were going to Church, which was near half a Mile from Captain
<HI>Meade</HI>'s House, a young Lady called to us, to know, did the Bell
ring? Mrs. <HI>Meade</HI> answered, yes, but finding even the Church-yard
Door not open'd, she said, she would not receive the Sacrament that
Morning: I asked her, why she should not? Because, said she, I have
told a Lye, in saying the Bell rang: I told her Scruple to Doctor
<HI>Hales</HI>; who join'd us, and presently dispelled her 
<PB N="98" REF="121"/> Fears, by assuring her, an innocent Mis∣take could
never be deemed a Lye.</P>
<P>Upon this we both ventured to receive the blessed Eucharist,
administered to us by a truly holy Hand; for, assuredly, Doctor
<HI>Hales,</HI> yours is such. And let no Person say, I do not reverence
the Clergy, for I really do; but not any one of them, who does not, as near as
Hu∣manity can go, aim at the Perfection of their Maker and Redeemer.</P>
<P>As I have already related the Manner of Captain <HI>Meade</HI>'s
Death, let us see how his pious Widow behav'd herself on the Occasion;
after having yell'd and scream'd to save Appearances, she lock'd up his
Body, and had him next Day buried.</P>
<P>She desired my Son, who remained disconsolate in the
House, to go to the Tower, and bring home whatever of the Captain's was
there; but he being ap∣prehensive that, perhaps, on Account of his Youth, and
his not having a Line with him, they might be refused to him, begg'd of me to
accompany him; which, as I was truly desirous of rendering any 
<PB N="99" REF="122"/> Service I could to his Family, I readily did. When we
arrived at his Apart∣ment there, for the Officers keep one in every Place where
they are obliged to be on Guard, and told the Mistress of the House my
melancholly Errand, she gave me the Keys of his Bureau, Port∣manteau, Trunk,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>When I took out his Regimentals, his Sash, and many other things
appertain∣ing to him, in which I had so often seen him array'd, I could not
refrain bursting into Tears, to think the dear Wearer of them was now no
more. Amongst other things we found two Guineas, which was a seasonable
Relief to the Widow. The Soldiers on Duty wept like Children at his Death's
sad Story. My Son convey'd all things safe; but the Sight of them did not
take the same Effect on his Re∣lict that they had done on me; for she only
said, she was very glad to get them.</P>
<P>My Boy, who colours Prints beauti∣fully, was employed by Mr.
<HI>Millan,</HI> so that he was innocently and elegantly em∣ployed. 
<PB N="100" REF="123"/> The Sweets of getting Money made him doubly diligent;
and, to be quite undisturbed, which it was impossi∣ble he should be
with me, so many Per∣sons coming for Letters, Petitions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
he took a Lodging for himself. I was one Day exceedingly surprised when
the Penny-post brought a Letter, directed to my Son; as it was marked
<HI>Teddington</HI> I open'd it, judging it was some Business that Mrs.
<HI>Meade</HI> wanted to have trans∣acted; when, O shameful! it was a
Love-letter to the Child, who was but sixteen Years of Age, and she is four
Years older than I am, with a Direction to him to meet her at a Coffee-house
in <HI>London,</HI> and an Offer of Marriage to him.</P>
<P>I really could scarce believe the true and credible Avouchment
of my own Eyes. Bless me! she amaz'd me! yet, thinking this might be a
Counterfeit, I shew'd it to the Boy, and desired he would go, and see
into this Matter, nei∣ther of us being acquainted with her Hand, which was a
desperate bad one.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="124"/>He went accordingly, and stay'd most
Part of the Evening abroad: When he return'd, he said he had inquired after
her every-where, and could not learn any Tidings of her; so I conceived this
Let∣ter was either wrote by some Enemy of hers, or else for Sport, by
some of the Girls at <HI>Teddington,</HI> in order to send him on a
Wild-goose Chase.</P>
<P>About six Weeks after the Captain's Death an Officer inquired
for me; as I did not know him I asked, what Com∣mands he had for me? He
desired to know of me, whether I was not a near Relation to Captain
<HI>Meade:</HI> To which, answering in the Affirmative, I desired the
Gentleman to sit, for he looked as if he had something of Importance to
de∣liver. Pray, Madam, said he, can you inform me what is become of the
Cap∣tain's Widow; my Reason for inquiring is this; a prior Wife has set up
a Claim to the Pension, and produced a Certifi∣cate, which we believe to be a
Counter∣fit, as it is dated twenty Years ago, and 'tis but reasonable to
think she would, <PB N="102" REF="125"/> in that time, have asserted her
just Rights. But this is not all, the Officers have made a Collection for the
Lady he acknow∣ledg'd, and the Children: But there is a Report spread, that
she is married to a Boy, young enough to be her Son, who was a Helper in the
Captain's Stable. This has damped the Charity of those who, had she even
been deceived by the Captain, would have assisted her.</P>
<P>I told him I had often heard the Cap∣tain relate that, in his
younger Days, he got in a League with one Mrs. <HI>Meadows,</HI> who, after
having been divorced from her Husband, set up a Coffee-house, where he
boarded and lodg'd: He found her in every Respect so unfaithful to him,
that he quitted her. Not long after she broke; and, being in Distress,
applied to Captain <HI>Meads,</HI> who, in Consideration of former
Friendship, agreed to give her annually 20 <HI>l.</HI> provided she
retired; which she agreed to.</P>
<P>I can't, Sir, said I, help thinking this is some Piece of her
Contrivance: 'Tis very possible, Madam, return'd he; and 
<PB N="103" REF="126"/> if you will be so kind to inquire into it, that
these Reports may be confuted, it will be of the utmost Consequence
to∣wards the future Welfare of the Widow and Orphans of your deceased
Relation. I shall pay my Respects to you again in two or three Days. The
Gentleman left me, and, after a good deal of Search amongst Mrs.
<HI>Meade</HI>'s Acquaintance, I learned she lodged in the <HI>Strand.</HI>
There I went, and found her in a very indif∣ferent Lodging; the Children were
in deep Mourning, but Madam herself was deck'd out very gay. After
customary Compliments, I told her I was surprised to see her out of
Mourning: Why, <HI>Caw∣zan,</HI> for that was her manner of Pro∣nunciation, I
am married. What, al∣ready, return'd I, e'er the Man you seem'd to doat on,
even to Extravagance, is cold in his Grave. Cold, says she, aye, he's cold
enough, and rotten too, by this time. May be you made him so before Death.
Why should you think so? Be∣cause you seem to have thrown of com∣mon
Decency: And is this all the Re∣spect <PB N="104" REF="127"/> you pay to so
good a Husband? In answer to this, and to my great Surprize, she
assured me, she never was married to the Captain in her Life.</P>
<P>Here was Hypocrisy! (that sly Fiend who 'scapes all but the
piercing Eye of GOD) in its utmost Perfection; if one may make use of
such an Epithet to such a devilish Sin. To live in Fornication, yet go to
the Communion without the least Purpose of Amendment of Life, and to
pretend such strong Affection to a Man, whose very Memory she shewed
she hated; I shall ever after this suspect the Sincerity of such an
over-acted Fond∣ness.</P>
<P>I told her my Errand, and that I was really sorry she had put
it out of my Power to vindicate her Conduct; which, cut of Regard to the poor
Children, I would gladly have done. She told me, Doctor <HI>Hales</HI> approved
of her Proceed∣ing; and so she did not care what I thought. Though I am
certain this must have been false, for the Doctor had such high Notions
of conjugal Fidelity, that <PB N="105" REF="128"/> he was true to the
<HI>Ashes</HI> of his Spouse, whom he lost when he was but a very young
Man, and having an agreeable Person, a sweet Temper, and unbounded
Learning, might no Doubt have raised his Fortune by a second Marriage.</P>
<P>Amongst other Instances of her Hypo∣crisy, this Woman used
to pretend, that even small Beer got into her Head, and would severely
censure any Lady who drank a Glass of Wine; yet now, though it was but nine
o' Clock in the Morning she called for a Dram, drank it off, and would have
had me follow her Example, but I had no Inclination to such a Break∣fast:
Besides, having no other Estate but my Head, on which were hourly De∣mands,
it was by no other means my Interest to destroy it.</P>
<P>I took my Leave; and, when I re∣lated this to my Son, the Boy
laughed excessively; and, as he then had no man∣ner of Respect for her,
he told me, he had gone to her according to her Ap∣pointment; that she had
treated him with two Bottles of Mountain, and press'd: <PB N="106" REF="129"/>
him hard to marry her: Indeed I re∣member, when he came home, I saw he had
been drinking, but he said some young Gentlemen of <HI>Ireland,</HI> whom
he met, gave him a Bottle of Wine.</P>
<P>However, some time after, she made him pay for his Liquor, for
she opened a Punch-house, which I believe she still keeps, at least
she did when I left <HI>Lon∣don</HI>; she wrote a Letter to my Son, to
desire to see him; accordingly he went; and Madam Temperance carried him
in∣to the Dining-room, and ordered her Husband, who served in Quality of
Waiter, to bring up a Bowl of Arrack-Punch, and half a Dozen Glasses of
Jelly. The Boy was well pleased with this sumptuous Fare; but when the good
Chear was ended, she demanded Pay∣ment, and he was obliged to part with his
Week's Earning, which he had just received. What could the most mer∣cenary
Prostitute have done worse?</P>
<P>But I believe she is sufficiently pu∣nish'd, for I was well
assured the Groom <PB N="107" REF="130"/> took the Liberty of correcting
her, and no-body pitied her.</P>
<P>I think the Philosopher was in the wrong who wished for
Windows in the human Breast; how miserable must we have been, when we
beheld those whom we esteem'd Friends, under specious Ap∣pearance,
plotting our Destruction; the Object of our Love, even in the midst of
well-feign'd Rapture, wishing them∣selves in the Arms of another: The Son
who bows his Knee in filial Reverence to his hoary Sire, cursing the Gout,
Pitargo, and the Rheum, for ending him no sooner. In short, the Scenes
would be too shocking; they would quite imbite Life.</P>
<P>Those philosophical Gentlemen, who have searched into the
Secrets of Na∣ture, have admired the Wisdom of Pro∣vidence, in kindly
concealing from us many things, which known, would make us wretched: I am
sure it was well for poor Captain <HI>Meade</HI> this Woman's Breast was
not transparent.</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="131"/>They have farther observed, that were our
Perceptions stronger than they are, the Senses, which convey Pleasure to
us, would become the Instruments of intoler∣rable Pain. 
<Q> 
<L>The Touch, if tremblingly alive all o'er,</L> 
<L>Would smart and agonize at ev'ry Pore.</L> 
<L>Or quick Effluvia darted to the Brain,</L> 
<L>Die of a Rose, in aromatic Pain.</L> 
<L>Shou'd Nature thunder in our open'd Ears,</L> 
<L>And stun us with the Music of the Spheres,</L> 
<BIBL><HI>Pope</HI>'s Essay on Man.</BIBL></Q> How terrible
must be our Condition?</P>
<P>Most married Persons, even in the happiest Wedlock, which
is, at best, but tolerable, look back with secret Regret on the sweet
Hours of Freedom, when no Anxiety reign'd, such as the Care of a Family, the
Sickness, or Dis∣obedience of Children, the total Loss of them, and a
thousand Troubles which perplex the married Life; and yet no 
<PB N="109" REF="132"/> sooner are they single, but they run into the same
Toils again, hardly affording time for a decent Mourning: Strange In∣fatuation!
In which, I think, the Ladies more excusable than the Men, since their
Weakness may make them want a Pro∣tector; yet they who can have Resolution
enough to know no second Bride-bed but the Grave, certainly claim a higher
Degree of Respect and Veneration.</P>
<P>In this aimable Light shines the present Lady Dowager
<HI>Meade,</HI> who, tho' left a Widow, in the Bloom of her Youth and Beauty,
the Widow of a Gentleman old enough to be her Father, who lost her sole
Guardian to their Offspring, turn'd all her Thoughts to the Improvement of
her Childrens Minds, and Fortunes, in both of which Heaven crown'd her
Goodness with Success, and the World with Honour.</P>
<P>I could mention another great Lady, not unallied to her, who
though she has many Virtues, as I have acknowledged in my first Volume,
being left exactly in the same Situation, was so faithful a 
<PB N="110" REF="133"/> Steward for her Son, that with his Rents, which she
received during his Minority, she purchased an Estate for herself; a
thousand Pounds a Year Jointure not be∣ing sufficient for her, neither
would she ever come to any Account with him for the Produce of his Estate.
The Gentle∣man had too high a Sense of filial Piety to commence any Suit in
Law against his Mother, though she was married to a second Husband, much
younger than her∣self, and has been 
<Q> 
<L>Like to a Step-dame, or a Dowager,</L> 
<L>"Long withering out a young Man's Revenue."</L> 
<BIBL>Shakespear.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>I am sure, Mr. <HI>Pilkington,</HI> I pray heartily for your
Life, lest I should ever be such a Fool as to engage in new Scenes of
Trouble; for if I could not keep your Heart, properly due to me, at a Time when
the flattering World called me agreeable, 
<Q><PB N="111" REF="134"/> 
<L>Much less would my declining Age,</L> 
<L>A second Husband's Love engage;</L> 
<L>Nor from the Dregs of Life could I re∣ceive,</L> 
<L>What the first sprightly Running could not
give.</L></Q></P>
<P>And now, to convince you, that I bear no Malice to you, I will
tell you an authentic Truth, true as the Gospel; for one Truth is, even by
mathematical Demonstration, adequate to another.</P>
<P>I was, since I came to <HI>Dublin,</HI> invited to a Widower's
House to Dinner: As his Business called him out, he had left Orders for
my Reception; your youngest Son was with me, and we were shewn into a
Parlour, where a Gentleman sat reading my first Volume. I did not
in∣terrupt him, as he seem'd to be deeply engaged. The Master of the
House com∣ing in, and saying, 
<Q REND="inline">"Mrs. <HI>Pilkington,</HI> I am very glad to see
you, and your Son;"</Q> made the Gentleman look at us attentively: After
Dinner, he told us, he had a Bond and Judgment entered on <PB N="112" REF="135"/> it against you, at the Suit of Mr. <HI>Clark,</HI> the Brewer;
that hitherto he had been compassionate, supposing us to be such
Creatures as your Imagination had painted us out to the Worl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to be: But, said he, now I am
convinced of my Error, I shall shew him no farther Mercy: My Boy starting
up, cry'd, What do you mean to do to my Father? Nothing, said Mr.
<HI>Edwards,</HI> only to try how he will brook Imprisonment; 'tis full as
fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for him as for your Mother; for
my own part I was weak enough to burst into Tears, and your Son swore a
good privateer Oath, that he would shoot any Man who should offer to
distress his Father.</P>
<P>Mr <HI>Edward</HI> seem'd surprised, as judg∣ing, no doubt,
we should have re∣joiced in your Calamity, as you had done in ours; yet being
of a generous, humane Disposition, he was touch'd with our Sorrows, and
granted that Liberty you now enjoy to our Intercession: You know the
Pers<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, and, if I set down a
Falshood, let him disprove me.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="136"/>Upon my Word, I must contradict the witty
Mr. <HI>Congreve,</HI> who says, 
<Q> 
<L>Heaven has no Rage, like Love to Hatred turn'd,</L> 
<L>Nor Hell a Fury like a Woman scorn'd.</L></Q> For I do not
hate you. I am in an Apathy, a cool Suspence from Pleasure, and from Pain,
both of which I must acknowledge I received from you; but that was when you
wrote in my Praise; and, at the very same time, said every thing
disagreeable to me: Was not this done to deceive the World? 
<Q REND="inline">"I will make them believe I love her; and, as
she has too much Pride and Decency to complain of me, I will in∣dulge my
Pleasure abroad, with Miss 
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">His present Wife.</NOTE><HI>N—y
S—d—s,</HI> or the Widow, or any W—e."</Q></P>
<P>I can't indeed say, but Miss <HI>S—d—s</HI>'s
Father owed a Favour to Mr. <HI>Pilkington,</HI> who kindly taking
Compassion on his Necessities, when his Lady was not sa∣tisfied with
his keeping a Mistress in the <PB N="114" REF="137"/> House with her, and
insisted on her be∣ing dismiss'd: Mr. <HI>P—n,</HI> ever hu∣mane,
received her to his Habitation with open Arms, gave the old Gentle∣man free
Ingress and Egress, for which he gratefully permitted the Parson to go to
bed to his Daughter; indeed I should have pitied her, had she been deceived
by the Report of my Death, so industri∣ously spread, into Marriage; but
she had it under my own Hand, that I was living, for I did the Creature the
Honour, S—t as she is, to write to her, in order to prevent her being
imposed on. I think the Form of Matrimony really wants an Explanation, if we
go according to the strict Letter of the Law. What a happy State must a
young Woman imagine her∣self entering into, where she is to be lov'd,
honour'd, cherish'd, nay, even worshipped; she has a Protector till the
Hour of Death, who is to forsake all, even his Parents, for her, if it be
re∣quired, who endows her with his For∣tune, and promises all this solemnly
at the Altar.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="138"/>Then follow the Words, <HI>Those whom</HI>
GOD <HI>hath joined, let no Man put as∣sunder.</HI></P>
<P>Now let us see how this is really to be interpreted, at least
how far this Cove∣nant is usually kept.</P>
<P>No sooner is the Honey-moon expir'd but the fawning Servant
turns a haughty Lord: Instead of honouring his Wife, 'tis Odds if he treats
her with common Civility; he shall tell her, to her Face, he wishes her
Death, in order to marry another. The Custom authorizes this free way of
speaking; yet I never knew it agreeable to any Wife, nor did I ever doubt but
the Husband spoke in the Sin∣cerity of his Heart.</P>
<P>As for our being endow'd with the worldly Goods of our Husbands,
'tis known they are so little apt to share with us, that it has always been
found necessary, in a Marriage-Settlement, to stipulate for Pin-money, a
very useful Clause even to the Husband, and it is much better his Wife
should have a Share of his Fortune, than be obliged to a 
<PB N="116" REF="139"/> Gallant for a Trifle, which Gratitude may make her repay
in too tender a manner.</P>
<P>Indeed the last Article against Divorce∣ment, I intirely
disapprove of; and am glad it has seem'd good to the Wisdom of the Church
to act in direct Contra∣diction to it: This has made Numbers easy, and, as
they tell us, 'tis not lawful to separate on any Cause, save that of
Adultery. A Woman of Spi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it, who is
married to a sordid disagreeable Wretch, has nothing to do but to make him
a Cuckold; and then welcome thrice dear Liberty: Yet methinks the Husbands
should, in Justice, return to their Wives, when they abandon them, the
Dowry they brought with them: Now, lest my worthy Husband should say by
this Rule, I should have nothing, who had not a Portion regularly paid, and
yet was a pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>petual Fortune to him,
I'll tell him a Story.</P>
<P>The Countess of <HI>Eglantine,</HI> one of the greatest
Beauties in <HI>Scotland,</HI> fell under the Displeasure of her Lord, for
no other <PB N="117" REF="140"/> Cause but having brought him seven
Daughters, all charming as this fair Northern Lass, and never a Son: On this
his Lordship assured her, he was deter∣mined to sue for a Divorce. The
Lady told him, she would readily agree to a Separation, provided he gave her
back what he had with her. He, supposing she meant pecuniary Affairs,
assured her she should have her Fortune to the last Penny. Nay, nay,
my Lord, said she, 
<Q REND="inline">"that winna do; return me my Youth, Beauty, and
Virginity, and dismiss me as soon as you please:"</Q> His Lord∣ship
being unable to answer this Demand, spoke no more of parting with his Lady,
and, e'er the Year expired, she made him the glad Father of a lovely Boy,
whose Birth restored Love and Harmony to his noble Parents. This was
related to me by the late Lord <HI>Primrose</HI>; and therefore I believe
it.</P>
<P>But now, Mr. <HI>P—n,</HI> tho' I pre∣sented you with this
Piece, don't think I meant you should take a Hint, and endeavour to end our
matrimonial War∣fare <PB N="118" REF="141"/> in the same manner: No, no, tho'
you linger about the Door in an Evening, in your long Cloke, and Slops; and
that I do believe thee to be my Spouse, by the amorous Glances darted thro'
thy Spy-glass, at the Window of my sacred and sequestred Bower, where
no profane thing, Priest, Dog, nor Worm, dare en∣ter, I am resolved to
remain obdurate: Sooner shall Lambs make Love to Lambs, Tygers to Tygers, and
every Creature couple with its Foe, as the Poet wittily expresses it, than
I unite with thee.</P>
<P>Yet verily thou dost manifest some Tokens of Grace,
inasmuch as thou darest not to contradict the Truth; I fancy when thy
<HI>Pen-using</HI> Talents perish'd, thy <HI>Pen-making</HI> ones shot
forth; which have been so fortunate as to recommend thee more effectually to
a certain B—'s Favour, than could ten hundred thousand Folios, sprung
from thy shallow Brain.</P>
<P>And truly this is an useful Accom∣plishment; I wish I
possessed it, 'twould save me some Pence in the Year; but there are
different Talents bestow'd on <PB N="119" REF="142"/> different People; I

<L>Ducks to a golden Fool:</L></Q> I make no Application.</P>
<P>There are many strange Ways of get∣ting into the Favour of the
Great, Pimp∣ing, Lying, Flattering: Who can be Proof against the Force of
such united Virtues? For your great Men who have too much Honour to pay a
just Debt never fail to reward the Servant of their <PB N="120" REF="143"/>
Vices; and it may be, some odd Knack recommends them, where those baser
Applia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>s are not required. On which
I have thought of a Story not quite fo∣reign to the present Purpose.</P>
<P>A Man who had a spent a good Part of his Life in dri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing Pins into a Wall; on the Point of
each he would with infi∣nite Dexterity throw a Pea; his Fame spread even to
the Emperor, who desired to see this matchless Son of Science; over∣joyed
he came, shewed his Trick to the infinite Pleasure of the Spectators; the
Emperor highly applauded him, and as he supposed this must be a Work of
long Practice to arrive at such a Proficiency in it, demanded of him how many
Years he had spent in attaining it; the Fellow being willing to inhance his
own Merit, assured the Monarch he had spent thirty Years in it; on which
the Emperor ordered him thirty Bastinadoes on the Soals of his Feet, for
having so much misspent his Time.</P>
<P>And, my dear Husband, if you have your Desert, you merit
just such a Re∣ward for misapplying Time in Trifles. 
<PB N="121" REF="144"/> Writing one good Sermon, or useful Book, both of which
when I knew you, you were as capable of as most young Men, would have tended
more to your Reputation, than any merely mechanical Art.</P>
<P>But in short, I sincerely pity you, and if ever you want a
Shilling, let me but know it, and if I have the good Fortune to have a Guinea
Subscription, for Gen∣tlemen seldom send me any smaller Coin, you
shall not go without one.</P>
<P>The dignified Clergy indeed have been niggardly to me. Yet not
against them all do I bring this Accusation, many of them have even a
bleeding Humanity for the Distresses of their Fellow Creatures; and have
not only pitied, but assisted me; and while I can in that noble List
inroll the sacred Names of <HI>Berkley</HI> and <HI>Delany,</HI> Patterns of
Virtue in their Lives, really apostolick in their Doctrine, winning
straying Souls with Goodness and Humi∣lity, learned as far as Humanity can
soar; surely no other of the Clergy need send me a Message when they
subscribe, not to <PB N="122" REF="145"/> divulge so terrible a Secret: I
always in this Case judge there is more Fear than Charity in their
Contributions. But here I must remember a certain cross Dean, to whom, as
my Father was Physician, I took the Liberty of applying. My Son went with the
Letter; he came out, and cried, "Boy, opening his ponderous and toothless
Jaws, what do you want? An Answer, Sir, said he; why, then my Answer is,
I won't. My Son protested he was quite startled at his ferocious Features
and stentorian Voice. Yet, after all, we laugh'd away our In∣dignation, as he
was really not worth it.</P>
<P>This admirable Orator ought to have a larger Rostrum than the
narrow Limits of a Pulpit to display his graceful Action, and never-enough to
be admired Grimace. A Theatre would suit his Genius; a Puppet one I mean,
where glorious Punch himself must yield the Prize.</P>
<P>I remember once to have seen this Re∣verend Flamen, in his
lengthened Dress, ascend St. <HI>Andrew</HI>'s Pulpit; where, re∣collecting
<PB N="123" REF="146"/> the enormous Iniquities of the Congregation, he of
sudden gave so fu∣rious a Toss to his Head, like a metal∣some Horse
hard rein'd, that back fell his Wig and down flew his Sermon; which not being
well secured, fluttered in nume∣rous Leaves about the Church, scattered
like the Ungodly, as Chaff before the Wind; the Sleepers awoke, the old Men who
dream'd Dreams, and the Virgins who saw Visions, started from their
dow∣ny Trance; and he, willing at least, to give us his Benediction, cried
aloud, 
<Q REND="inline">"Depart ye cursed into everlasting Fire, which
that ye may all do, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>The late Lady <HI>Rawden,</HI> not long after she became a
Widow, invited the Dean as her Parish Minister, to Dinner; the Lady went to
take the Air, and Sir <HI>John,</HI> then a Child, was in the Parlour; the Dean
fell into Chat with the sweet Boy, and amongst other Questions said, do
you know me? No, Sir; why I am Dean C—, your Parish Minister. Poor
Master innocently verified the old Pro∣verb, <PB N="124" REF="147"/> that
Children speak Truth, for he cried out, O indeed, I heard my Mam∣ma say,
you were the worst Preacher in <HI>Dublin:</HI> His Reverence's Wrath was
hereupon so rais'd, that he failed not to reproach the Lady, who, to pacify
him, corrected the poor Child: However, she could not avoid relating the
Story; which I heard from Lady <HI>Rawden,</HI> at Mrs. <HI>Percival</HI>'s, to
the infinite Laughter of the Auditors, and which I from henceforth consign to
Fame in these my immortal Labours.</P>
<P>I was much obliged to Sir <HI>John</HI>'s Hu∣manity in
<HI>London,</HI> which I gratefully ac∣knowledge. But there is one great Man I
cannot pass over; great, according to Serjeant <HI>Kite</HI>'s Definition of
one, for he is full six Foot high; his Fortune rais'd from the noble Spirit
of Malt; for I do remember, like Prince <HI>Henry,</HI> that poor Creature's
Small-Beer, which his Father sold to mine; and from the golden Grains arose
a princely Fortune; from the humbly Dray appeared a Coach, such as
Ambassadors use when on public <PB N="125" REF="148"/> Occasions, they
by their State give us a Picture of the Grandeur of the Poten∣tate they
represent. 
<Q> 
<L>For if the Man such Honour have,</L> 
<L>What must be his, who keeps the Knave?</L></Q></P>
<P>Not that I would hence infer all Am∣bassadors to be Rogues,
farther than ly∣ing a little for the Good of their King and Country.</P>
<P>It was this worthy Gentleman who told them at <HI>White</HI>'s
that I had nothing to publish: I had quick Intelligence of his Favour; after
which Obligation he came to visit me, and would have been very kind to me
because I was a Gentlewo∣man, a Person he could depend on; and he was then
in Distress, being at a Distance from his Lady and native Coun∣try; to be
sure I ought to have been cha∣ritable, but that I always stood in the Way
of my own Preferment; and ano∣ther unlucky Circumstance for my Swain was,
that I remembered the deplorable <PB N="126" REF="149"/> Condition to which he
reduced his first Wife, who died of his Love, as did also his Child, the
Nurse it was given to, and her Husband. Noble Atchievements worthy of your
illustrious Birth and Lineage. For, 
<Q> 
<L>'Tis you can taint the sweetest Joy,</L> 
<L>And in the Shape of Love destroy.</L></Q> However, I
should have pass'd you over in Silence, but that you told a Nobleman here,
I had been quite compliant to your Desire: Why then you prove yourself a
generous Lover, in sending me Five Bri∣tish Shillings for a Book. A
wondrous Bounty really; why your Neighbour the B— always pays a Moidore
Commu∣tation for Adultery; and sure you ought to give more than a Man, who by
the Power committed to him from above, is entitled to give himself
Absolution.</P>
<P>Your hoary canting Sire was a Votary to <HI>Venus,</HI> even in
old Age. When a certain Widow, and her dancing Daugh∣ter lodged at
<HI>Glasnevin,</HI> a young Gen∣tleman <PB N="127" REF="150"/> who was much
enamoured of the younger Dame, used to visit her every Evening; as he did
not care to have it known, he went in thro' a low Window to Miss's
Bedchamber: It happened that Miss being abroad, the venerable Pair made
Choice of that Place, to indulge the gentler Passions: The young Gentle∣man
came according to Custom, and without Ceremony threw up the Sash, flew in,
and unfortunately started from their downy Couch the reverend Elder and the
chaste Matron.</P>
<P>Miss following her Mother's Example, resigned her Virgin
Charms to you, and lost at once her Health and Reputa∣tion.</P>
<P>This might have been my unhappy Lot; but that however careless I
have been about Reputation, I was always de∣termined not to put my own precious
Person into any Peril.</P>
<P>Now says my Reader, if he be a Gi∣ber, how this prating old
Woman, who certainly never had any Temptation, boasts of Chastity: Ay, 'tis
no Matter, I <PB N="128" REF="151"/> have had so many amorous Epistles,
Odes, Songs, Anacreonticks, Saphics, Lyricks, and Pindaricks, in Praise of my
Mind and Person too, sent to me since I came to <HI>Ireland</HI>; that I
believe some Gentlemen, tho' I cannot, have found me out to be a marvellous
proper Woman. 
<Q> 
<L>I'll get my Room hung round with Looking-Glasses,</L> 
<L>And entertain a score or two of Tay∣lors;</L> 
<L>And study Fashions to adorn my Body.</L></Q></P>
<P>And some time or other, as I find it is the Mode in
<HI>London,</HI> for the Ladies to publish the Triumphs of their Eyes, and
how many Men fell a Prey to their Lux∣ury; or, as Dr. <HI>Young</HI> says, 
<Q> 
<L>Had ever Nymph such Reason to be glad?</L> 
<L>In Duel fell three Lovers, two ran mad.</L></Q> 
<PB N="129" REF="152"/> Though I cannot indeed produce such dreadful Proofs of
my Beauty as some of them; nor chuse I to have my Print ex∣hibited before
my Work, but Testimo∣nies of Authors with Regard to it, I hope I may be
allowed. The same Va∣nity Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> shews in the Vindication of his
Wit, Learning and Humanity may be pardoned in a Female, in the Vin∣dication of
that far nobler Part, external Loveliness; for a Mind in a Woman is of little
Consequence. Dr. <HI>Young</HI> seems of a different Mind; but great
Authors sometimes vary: As it is now my Inte∣rest to be of his Side the
Question, I shall give his Opinion, and who knows if it should chance to
be true, but my Admirers may be real ones. 
<Q> 
<L>What's Female Beauty but an Air divine,</L> 
<L>Thro' which the Mind's all gentle Graces shine;</L> 
<L>They like the Sun irradiate all between,</L> 
<L>The Body charms, because the Soul is seen.</L> 
<L><PB N="130" REF="153"/>Hence some we see are Captives of a
Face,</L> 
<L>They know not why, of no peculiar Grace.</L></Q> And so much
for what I never had, ex∣cept according to his Judgment. There as a Proof of my
Humility, I put in my Claim, and will, like 
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Zenophon's
Banquet.</NOTE><HI>Socrates,</HI> dispute the Prize even with
<HI>Alcibiades.</HI></P>
<P>Now I have mentioned this small but inimitable well wrote Book,
which was recommended to me by Dr. <HI>Swift,</HI> and which I in return
commend to all such of my fair Readers as have a Taste for real Wit, in
which the divine <HI>Socrates</HI> as con∣spicuously shone, as he did in
Purity of Life and Constancy in Martyrdom; that they peruse it with Care,
as it will refine their Ideas and improve their Judgments, polish their
Stile, shew them true Beauty, and lead them gently and agreeably to its 
<PB N="131" REF="154"/> prime Origin and Source; here they will find 
<Q> 
<L>Divine Philosophy,</L> 
<L>Not so harsh and rugged as some falsely think,</L> 
<L>But musical as is <HI>Apollo</HI>'s Lute;</L> 
<L>And a perpetual Feast of nectar'd Sweets,</L> 
<L>Where no crude Surfeit reigns.</L> 
<BIBL>Milton.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>I must here observe in my tracing Au∣thors thro' each other,
<HI>Zenophon</HI> and <HI>Plato</HI> borrowed from <HI>Socrates,</HI> whose
Disciples they were. <HI>Zenophon</HI> acknow∣ledges it as freely as I do the
Instructions I received from Dr. <HI>Swift.</HI> Lord <HI>Shafts:
bury</HI>'s Search after Beauty, is copied from <HI>Socrates</HI>; Mr.
<HI>Pope</HI>'s Ethics stolen from both; and the learned Mr.
<HI>Hutcheson</HI>'s Beauty and Harmony, an Imitation of the great
Philosophers and excellent Moralists first mentioned.</P>
<P>Had Mr. <HI>Hutcheson</HI> stop'd at this Book, by which he
had acquired some Degree of Reputation, both as a Writer, a Divine, 
<PB N="132" REF="155"/> and a Mathematician, he had done wisely; but O! his
Essay on the Passions over∣turned his scarce established
Praise; if it has any Meaning, it is like dark veil'd <HI>Cotyto,</HI> in her
Ebon Chair, close curtained round, impenetrably obscure, or from his
Flames, 
<Q> 
<L>No Light, but rather Darkness vi∣sible.</L></Q> I really
thought it was the Defect of my Head that made me not comprehend this Piece,
till I heard the present Lord Bishop of <HI>Elphin,</HI> whose Learning
or Judgment were never yet doubted, declare he did not understand it. After
all, whether the Defect lay in the Book or the B—p let the Reader
determine.</P>
<P><HI>Wollaston</HI>'s Religion of Nature deli∣neated, tho'
frequently intermingled with Mathematical Proofs, is yet so plain, that it
demonstrates the Author's Thoughts clearly; which whoever does, can never
fail to write with equal Per∣spicuity. But Learning seems encum∣bered 
<PB N="133" REF="156"/> with Words or technical Terms sig∣nifying nothing; and
our Schoolmasters, lest our Children should attain it too soon if they
should lead them to the Fountain from whence the Streams of Knowledge flow
copious to quench or rather to in∣crease that Desire of it which we
observe from their first prattling Infancy, chuse rather to make them
begin at the Bottom of some Rivulet, from whence, with in∣finite Difficulty,
when they have waded about half Way, they are obliged to re∣tire by the Command
of another, then begin at another, till wearied they give over, and hate the
fruitless, endless, un∣profitable Toil. I believe that formerly they had a
better Method of instructing than what is now practised. I judge this by
the Eloquence shewn by the Youth of those Ages, and the beautiful Pieces of
Poetry still extant, some of them stiled the minor Poets; perhaps to
distinguish them from the venerable Antients, or on Account of the juvenile
Years of the Authors.</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="157"/>Perhaps Nature in her prime Creation was
productive of more Strength and Beauty even in the Mind, than at this Time,
when Luxury and Excess pull down our ros'd-cheek'd Youth, emaciate their
Bodies, and enervate their Under∣standings; for Mind and Body are so
closely united, that whatever affects the one, must of Consequence affect
the other.</P>
<P>I hope my Reader will pardon my Re∣flections on the Works of
those valuable Writers I have mentioned, for I mean no Disrespect to
their sacred Memories; but as I am accused of being a Plagiary my∣self,
which I own I am; my Intention is to prove all Writers to be Thieves as well as
their humble Servant, <HI>Shakespear</HI> alone excepted.</P>
<P>Some of my learned Correspondents send me Word I do not write
these my own Memoirs; why I fancy were I to publish their Epistles, the
World would not believe that any of them were my As∣sistants; but their
Modesty makes them <PB N="135" REF="158"/> conceal their Names, and I have no
Cu∣riosity to discover them.</P>
<Q> 
<L>With such all Authors steal their Works or buy,</L> 
<L><HI>Garth</HI> did not write his own Dispen∣sary.</L> 
<BIBL>Pope.</BIBL></Q>
<P>But Authors are a little too fond of Fame to let any one run away
with it from them, or a tolerable Performance pass for the Work of another; I
speak from Experience; I have wrote for Num¦bers, and do still, but no
Human Crea∣ture ever helped me out with a single Line; if they did let it
appear a∣gainst me, and my Writings be torn to Fragments, or condemned to
Flames.</P>
<P>And talking of burning, puts me in mind of dear Lord
<HI>Kingsborough,</HI> who because he saw that I endeavour'd to do but
barely Justice to his inimitable Pen, bid me burn all his Letters, upon which
in a Passion, I snatch'd up my Pen, even before his Face, and scribbled
the follow∣ing Lines.

<L><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">For the Benefit of the illiterate,
to whom these Lines may appear as obscure as some in <HI>Persius</HI>
let them read the Works of <HI>Livy</HI> and <HI>Pythagoras,</HI> and may-hap
they may guess at the meaning; if they cannot, their Time at least will be
innocent∣ly employ'd, till they can come at the Grand Ar∣cana of the
Rosicrusians, or discover the Lon∣gitude.</NOTE>How could my dear Lord
make me such a Request?</L>
<L>I flatter myself, you are only in Jest;</L>
<L>Those Epistles which all my soft Rap∣tures
inspire,</L>
<L>Do you think I could bear to commit to the Fire;</L>
<L>Like <HI>Mutius,</HI> I'd put my own Hand in the Flame,</L>
<L>For the Elements us'd to compose your lov'd Name:</L>
<L>Should I promise Obedience, I surely should lye,</L>
<L>Give me a more gentle Command, I'll comply;</L>
<L><PB N="137" REF="160"/>But here I should baffle the best
of your Art,</L>
<L>For each Line you have wrote, is en∣grav'd on my Heart.</L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>His Lordship was so humane, as not to insist on my
Obedience; and now my Lord, I tell you publickly, that, not the grim Tyrant
Death shall divorce me from the inestimable Treasure I possess,
they shall rest with me in the Grave, next to my Heart, 
<Q> 
<L>When every Motion, Sense, and Pulse is o'er,</L> 
<L>And even my <HI>Kingsborough</HI> belov'd no
more.</L></Q></P>
<P>I have often, my Lord, reflected with Pleasure, on the
Blessing my Father gave me, when he brought your Lordship in∣to the
World; why according to the Mid∣wife's Phrase, you are one of his Chil∣dren,
and consequently my Brother, for I must prove a Kindred to you, though I
fetch it from <HI>Japheth</HI>; as I have been long buried to my Brother, and
by your <PB N="138" REF="161"/> Lordship's Bounty, have acquired a kind of
second Birth, 
<Q> 
<L>New born I may a nobler Brother claim,</L> 
<L>And join'd to thine immortalize my Name.</L></Q> Pardon my
Presumption if I am too bold, 'tis owing to your Lordship's Indulgence both
to my Scribbling and Prattling Vein. So. 
<Q> 
<L>You must excuse a Nymph of Letters,</L> 
<L>Thus Poets often treat their Betters.</L></Q> But I think I
must speak in the Superla∣tive Mood, and call you best of Men; for what
Day of your Life passes, with∣out a worthy Deed to crown it? Your Virtue
would sigh to lose one.</P>
<P>Indeed, my Lord, I love you, and if you are too great to be
beloved, 
<Q> 
<L>Be greater greater still, and be ador'd.</L></Q> Now, in
return, I beg a Place in your Friendship, where, if I grow, the Har∣vest is
your own.</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="162"/>But Oh! I am Sick of many Griefs, 
<Q> 
<L>And this frail Tenement of Clay,</L> 
<L>Must quickly, very quick decay.</L></Q> But, perhaps all
things are ordered for the best, on which Hope, I relate what I know to be
Truth.</P>
<P>A Captain of a Man of War took a Fancy to despise his Wife,
and engage with another Woman: The Wife took it patiently, till at last he
had the Impu∣dence to tell her, he would either bring his Harlot to live with
her, or she and his three Children should turn out: The Lady was confounded
at so strange a Proposal, and begg'd three Days time to consider of it;
and then she would give him a determinate Answer: He agreed: She told her
Affliction to a Friend, and begg'd her Advice; on which they resolved to
consult Doctor <HI>Potter,</HI> late Lord Archbishop of
<HI>Canter∣bury:</HI> Accordingly they took a Boat, and went to
<HI>Lambeth</HI>: The good Prelate proposed an Invocation to the Almighty 
<PB N="140" REF="163"/> to direct their Counsels: After Prayers he desired
the Lady not, by any means, to quit her House, but to acquiesce in her
Husband's Desire, and let him bring the Woman home; and, depend on it, said
he, God will assist you, and what at present appears an Evil, will turn
out a Blessing to you: So, giving them his Be∣nediction, they departed full
of Hope of an happy Issue.</P>
<P>The Husband, who flatter'd himself that the Wife would quit the
House, was not a little astonish'd to find her quite submissive to
his Commands, and consent∣ing to live with his Mistress.</P>
<P>Accordingly he ordered his Chariot, bade his Wife prepare Dinner,
and went for his Harlot, whom he brought home triumphant, and handed into the
Dining-room; the Wife received her with a Ci∣vility that confounded and enraged
her; she brought her a Glass of <HI>Lisbon</HI> Wine, and then left her
with the Captain, who, in a few Minutes came down, and seeing all things
ready for Dinner, ordered his Wife to go and bring the Lady down: 
<PB N="141" REF="164"/> She obey'd, but Madam called her a hundred Names, flew
at the Captain, beat him, and put herself in such a Rage, that she fell
into Fits, was seiz'd with a Fever, and died.</P>
<P>After this Catastrophe, the Captain seriously reflecting on
the Submission and Virtue of his Wife, thus address'd her: My Dear, if I
thought there was a Possibility of your pardoning my past Errors, and
never reproaching me with them, I do assure you, I wou'd never fall in∣to
them again, but make a faithful tender Husband to you. The Lady burst into
joyful Tears at this happy Change, and kindly assured him, she would
never even think of what was past: She told him it was by the Archbishop's
Advice she had acted with the Moderation she now found to be so happy in
the Event; and they both went to thank the venerable Prelate, who truly partook
in their Joy. The Captain died about a Year after, and left his whole Fortune
to his Lady, who lives an honourable Widow at <HI>Green∣wich.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="165"/>Thus we may see, if we persevere in our
Duty, the Almighty is not slow to hear, nor reward; 
<Q> 
<L>But, when we sink beneath a Load of Grief,</L> 
<L>By unforeseen Expedients brings Relief.</L></Q></P>
<P>I was told a pretty Circumstance of his Grace, when he was at
<HI>Westminster</HI> School: It seems he stood terribly in awe of the
Rod, and having committed some Mistake that deserved Chastisement,
which Doctor <HI>Busby</HI> was very liberal in bestowing, he was ready to
die with the Apprehension of it; when a good bold-spirited Lad, taking
Compassion on him, own'd the Fault, and took the Whip∣ing; for which his
timid Friend pro∣mised to be grateful, if ever it came in his way to serve
him: They both took holy Orders, but met not till many Years after, when his
Grace was an Archbishop, his Friend remained a Curate; but Time, which brings
all things about, so order'd it, that the Archbishop and the Curate 
<PB N="143" REF="166"/> met at a Nobleman's House: His Grace, hearing him
named, recollected both the Gentleman, the Whipping, and his own Promise of
Gratitude; and finding the Curate had no Preferment, he gave him a very good
Living.</P>
<P>I hope these Incidents will not be dis∣agreeable to my
Readers, as I really set down nothing but what I know to be Truth, which is
more than most of our modern Memorialists can say, who present us with
Heaps of Improbabilities, and ex∣pect implicit Faith from us; and if what
some of them have told us be genuine, though it may redound to their Profit,
it never can to their Honour; for their Actions are neither worthy being
record∣ed, nor their Writings of being read; the true End of Writing being to
give In∣struction with Pleasure, which, whoever is so happy to do, may
justly hope for a Place in the Temple of Fame: But 
<Q> 
<L>All human kind will needs be Wits,</L> 
<L>"Tho' Millions miss for one that hits:</L> 
<L><PB N="144" REF="167"/>"Our chilling Climate, hardly bears,</L>

<L>"A Sprig of Bays in Fifty Years,</L> 
<L>"Yet every Fool his Claim alleges,</L> 
<L>"As if it grew in common Hedges.</L><BIBL>Swift's
Rhapsody.</BIBL></Q> </P>
<P>And having once more quoted our un∣rivalled Dean, and being well
assured no Part of my Work can be half so agree∣able or entertaining to
the Publick, as that which relates to him, I shall, as far as in my Power,
present them with his lively Portraiture. The most minute Circumstances
relating to so great a Man cannot, I hope, be deem'd trivial; since we find
by Experience, that the Night-Scene, so beautifully drawn by
<HI>Shakespear,</HI> between <HI>Brutus</HI> and his Domesticks, sleeping
in his Tent, the little Incident of his taking the Lute out of the Boy's Hand,
and saying, when he fell asleep, 
<Q> 
<L>This is a sleepy Tune:—O murtherous Sleep,</L> 
<L>Layest thou thy leaden Mace upon my Boy,</L> 
<L><PB N="145" REF="168"/>That plays thee Musick? Gentle Knave,
good Night:</L> 
<L>I will not do thee so much Wrong to wake thee;</L> 
<L>If thou dost nod, thou break'st thy Instru∣ment,</L> 
<L>I'll take it from thee, and, good Boy, good Night.</L></Q></P>
<P>Do we not love him more in this ami∣able View of him, than in all
his Con∣quests; or that sad Act whereby he thought to give his Country
Liberty? The World are sufficiently acquainted with the Dean's publick
Character, be it then my Task to trace him in private Life; for there only it
is we can frame a true Judgment of any Person, the rest is frequently mere
Outside.</P>
<P>When the Dean was at <HI>Bellcamp,</HI> at the House of the
Reverend Doctor <HI>Grat∣ton,</HI> he wrote to Doctor <HI>Delany,</HI> to come
and dine with him, mighty <HI>Thomas Thumb,</HI> and her serene Highness of
<HI>Lilly∣put,</HI> meaning my Husband and me: Ac∣cordingly we went; the Dean
came out <PB N="146" REF="169"/> to meet us, and I, by Agreement, hiding my
Face, Mr. <HI>Pilkington</HI> told him they had picked up a Girl on the Road,
and desired to know whether they might bring her in? He, guessing who it
was, said, let her shew her Face, and if she be likely, we'll admit her.
On this I took down my Fan, and said, O, in∣deed, Sir, I am: Well then,
said he, give me your Hand. He led me into a Parlour, where there were twelve
Clergy men, and said, those Fellows coming in had brought a Wench with
them; but, added he, we'll give her a Dinner, poor Devil! and keep the Secret
of our Bre∣thren:—As most of the Gentlemen knew me, we were very merry
on this odd Introduction.</P>
<P>Pox on you, you Slut, said the Dean, you gave me a Hint for my
polite Con∣versation, which I have pursued: You said, it would be better
to throw it into Dialogue; and suppose it to pass amongst the Great; I
have improved by you: O dear Sir, said I, 'tis impossible you should do
otherwise. Matchless Sauciness! re∣turn'd <PB N="147" REF="170"/> he:
Well, but I'll read you the Work; which he did with infinite Hu∣mour, to our
high Entertainment.</P>
<P>It was <HI>Christmas</HI> time, and froze very hard: The Dean,
meditating Revenge, set the Wine before a great Fire, the Corks of the Wine
being secured with Pitch and Rosin; which began, in a little while, to
melt: No sooner did the Dean perceive they were fit for his Purpose, but he
slyly rubbed his Fingers on them, and daubed my Face all over. Instead of
being vexed, as he expected I would, I told him he did me great Honour in
sealing me for his own. Plague on her, said he, I can't put her out of
Temper; yet he seemed determined to do it, if possible, for he asked
the Company, if they had ever seen such a Dwarf? and insisted, that I
should pull off my Shoes till he measured me: To this I had no Inclination
to submit, but he was an ab∣solute Prince, and Resistance would have
little availed me; so when I obey'd, he said, Why, I suspected you had
either <PB N="148" REF="171"/> broken Stockings, or foul Toes, and in either
Case should have delighted to have exposed you.</P>
<P>He then made me stand up against the Wainscot, leaned his
Hand as heavy as he could upon my Head, till I shrunk under the Weight, to
almost half my Proportion; then making a Mark with his Pencil, he affirmed, I
was but three Foot two Inches high.</P>
<P>Dinner was brought up, and I being, like Mrs. <HI>Qualmsick</HI>
the Curate's Wife, always a breeding, could not eat any; the Gentlemen
guessing at my Circum∣stances, by my decreasing Face, and in∣creasing
Waste, were so over-obliging to know what I liked best; that at last I
told the Dean, I wish'd I was a Man, that I might be treated with less
Cere∣mony: Why, said the Dean, it may be you are: I wish, Sir, said I,
you would put the Question to the Company, and accordingly to their Votes,
let my Sex be determined. I will, said he; <HI>Fil∣kington,</HI> what say
you? A Man, Sir: they all took his Word; and, in Spite <PB N="149" REF="172"/>
of Petticoats, I was made a Man of af∣ter Dinner: I was obliged to put a
To∣bacco-pipe in my Mouth; but they so far indulged me, as to let it be an
empty one; as were the Dean's, Doctor <HI>Delany</HI>'s, and my Husband's.</P>
<P>The Dean asked me, could I play Crib∣bidge? I said, I could:
Upon which he called for Cards; but, upon Recollection, said, he would not
play with a Beggar, for he should stand no Chance; for if he won, he would
not take the Money, and if he lost, he must in Honour pay. But why a
Beggar, Mr. Dean, said Doctor <HI>Delany?</HI> A married Curate must of
Con∣sequence be a Beggar, return'd he, and you are another; and Pox on me, if
I can ever get acquainted with any Persons but Beggars; and I don't think but
this Woman, or Man here, is in the way of producing another. Then, Sir, I hope
you will be so kind to stand Godfather, which will secure it from so
hard a Fate. So! said he, more Demands upon me! Well, if it be a Boy, I don't
much care <PB N="150" REF="173"/> if I do; but if it be a little Bitch I'll
never answer for her.</P>
<P>A Day or two after this the Dean came to Town, and summoning a
<HI>Sena∣tus Consultum,</HI> as he called those few Friends whom he
peculiarly regarded; he placed us round a great Table, where he told us, we
were an empannell'd Jury; and he placed himself at the Head of it, where he
sat as Judge. He then told us, the Reason why we were summoned, Mr.
<HI>Gratton</HI>'s favourite Hen was put to Death by an unlucky Stroke of a
Whip, by one of my Fellows, as I suppose: I accused them, and they denied
the Fact; but as Murder always will come to light, I found the Hen's Head and
Neck in the Seat of my Chaise-box; and now I want to convict the Criminal:
Accordingly he ordered his three Men Servants to come before us, and related
the following Story to them: When Doctor <HI>Donne,</HI> after∣wards Dean of
<HI>St. Paul's, London,</HI> took Possession of the first Living he
ever had, being a speculative Man, he took a Walk into the Church-yard, where
the Sexton <PB N="151" REF="174"/> was digging a Grave, and throwing up a Skull,
the Doctor took it up, to con∣template thereon; and found a small Sprig, or
headless Nail sticking in the Temple, which he drew out secretly, and
wrapt it up in the Corner of his Hand∣kerchief; he then demanded of the
Grave∣digger, whether he knew whose Skull that was? He said he did, very
well; declar∣ing it was a Man's who kept a Brandy-shop, an honest drunken
Fellow, who one Night taking two Quarts of that comfortable Creature, was found
dead in his Bed the next Morning: Had he a Wife, said the Doctor? Yes, Sir:
Is she living? Yes: What Character does she bear? a very good one; only
indeed the Neighbours reflected on her, because she married the Day after
her Husband was buried; though, to be sure, she had no great Reason to
grieve after him. This was enough for the Doctor, who under Pretence of
visiting all his Parishioners, called on her; he asked her several
Que∣stions, and amongst others, What Sick∣ness her first Husband died
of? She giv∣ing <PB N="152" REF="175"/> him the same Account he had be∣fore
received, he suddenly opened the Handkerchief, and cried, in an
authori∣tative Voice, <HI>Woman, do you know this Nail?</HI> She was struck
with Horror at the unexpected Demand, and instantly owned the Fact: And so,
Fellow, said Dean <HI>Swift,</HI> do you know this Head? The Criminal
confessed his Fault, and the Jury brought him in guilty of Hen∣slaughter,
in his own Defence, for he declared he was hungry, and did eat it, having no
Malice prepense to it, but ra∣ther Love. On Account of his Sincerity, and our
Intercession, the Dean pardon'd him.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Gratton</HI> had presented the Dean with a small
Cask of fine Ale, of which he was very choice; good Malt-Liquor not being
easily purchased even in <HI>Ire∣land.</HI> On <HI>Sunday</HI> Evening the
Dean's Set of Intimates came as usual, to pass it with him, and he being in
high good Humour, said, he would treat us with a Pot of this Ale. I had the
Honour of being intrusted with the Key of the Cel∣lar, <PB N="153" REF="176"/>
with a particular Order to hold the Candle in such a Position, that it
might drop into the Tankard; as also not to put the Spiggot fast in, but
let the Drink run about. After receiving his Com∣mands, which I promised
punctually to obey, I went down, but had scarce open'd the Door, when Doctor
<HI>Delany</HI> and Doc∣tor <HI>Sheridan</HI> were with me. O Breach of
Trust, unpardonable! We sat down on a Bench, and each of us drank; but we
laughed so heartily at cheating the Dean, that he stole down, having some
Suspicion, that where there was a Wo∣man, and two Clergymen, there might be a
Plot, and surprised us: I, in Imita∣tion of his Servant, told him, the
Par∣sons seduced me, and I did drink: Pox choke you all, said he.</P>
<P>In vain did I, with all the moving Eloquence of a female Orator,
plead for Pardon: The Key was taken from me, and Mr. <HI>Rochford</HI> was,
before my Face, invested with my Honours; and I, Oh fatal Sentence! condemn'd
to be Sock-washer <PB N="154" REF="177"/> to the blackguard Boy, who wait∣ed
on the under Butler's under Butler.</P>
<P>I would have persuaded Mr. <HI>Rochford</HI> to plead in my
Behalf, but he was obdu∣rate as Adamant; especially as by my Disgrace he
rose. However, not long after, I presented him with an humble Petition,
wherein I failed not to extol the Neatness of the Boy's Feet, since they
came into my Hands, insomuch 
<Q> 
<L>—that not the nicest Nose</L> 
<L>Cou'd, in the Dog-days, smell his Toes.</L></Q></P>
<P>And, as a Reward, I was made In∣spectoress-general of all the
drinking Ves∣sels; but no more intrusted with the Key of the Cellar: To
say the Truth, I could not well vindicate my Conduct in that im∣portant
Point.</P>
<P>The Dean had twenty of those agree∣able Whims, which kept us all
chearful, as was his Intent; for I suppose my Readers will believe, that
neither he nor we valued the Ale, but for the Jest's sake.</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="178"/>No Man living told a Story to more Advantage
than the Dean; there never was a Word too little or too much in it, it was
always apt, full, clear, and concise, truly epigrammatick.</P>
<P>It would be well for their Readers, if some of our Writers had
learn'd this happy Art; but they draw out their Tales to a tiresome Length,
dwelling on every trivial Circumstance, and omitting things of greater
Consequence, and when they would seem wise, they grow obscure.

<L>And labours till she clouds herself all o'er.</L> 
<BIBL>Pope.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>The Dean told me, he did remember that he had not laugh'd above
twice in his Life; once at some Trick a Moun∣tebank's Merry-Andrew play'd;
and the other time was at the Circumstance of <HI>Tom Thumb</HI>'s killing
the Ghost; and, I can assure Mr. <HI>Fielding,</HI> the Dean had a high
Opinion of his Wit, which must <PB N="156" REF="179"/> be a Pleasure to him,
as no Man was ever better qualified to judge, possessing it so
eminently himself.</P>
<P>Yet was he so free from any vain Os∣stentation of it, that
he could suit his Converse to the Talents of his Company; insomuch that,
I believe, had they pro∣posed to play Push-pin, or talk Non∣sense, he
would have complied even with the latter, if it had been in his Power.</P>
<P>I have known him fill up Rhymes, given after the manner of the
<HI>French,</HI> though he had found it true musical Rhythm, so esteem'd
by the Antients; nay, he could deal in the 
<Q> 
<L>Pun ambiguous, or Conundrum quaint.</L></Q> Which some
book-learned Blockheads, for such I have seen, with each a Store of Lumber,
crude and undigested in their Brains, would no doubt have scorn'd: But, as
<HI>Horace</HI> observes, there is a Sweet∣ness in sometimes mingling
Folly with Wisdom; and I am well convinced no Person, without a good
Understanding, can even play the Fool agreeably.

<P>One Night, that I had the Honour to be in as polite a Set of
Company as ever <HI>Europe</HI> bred, they took a Fancy that each of them would
imitate the Voice of a different Animal, either Bird or Beast, each having
fixed on what suited their Inclination; they began the Con∣sort at once:
Would not any one, who had refused to join in the Frolick, have seem'd
ridiculous? 'Tis true, indeed, this was attended with one mortifying
Con∣sequence; for the Servants, scar'd at the hideous Yelling, and
concluding we were all fighting, ran hastily in to part us; but finding all
was right, they left us; however, we heard them laugh heartily at our
Entertainment.</P>
<P>As I have often mentioned the Dean's Charity, one ill conferr'd
Instance of it cannot, I believe, but make my Readers smile:</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="181"/>He observed a Woman, whose whole
Estate was a Sieve of Fruit, which she had in a Stall, where she sat
footing worn-out Stockings. Seeing the Woman very decent, and always at work,
he judged her to be a proper Person for him to assist; especially as,
by the Re∣port of her Neighbours, she was a very honest Woman. The Dean
asked her, why she did not try to borrow twenty Pounds, and set up a
handsome Fruit∣shop. Alas-a-day, Sir, said she, who would trust a
poor Creature like me with such a Sum? Why, said he, if I thought you would
improve it, I would lend it you. The Woman promised fair, and the Dean lent
her the Money; and, at the same time, wrote down the parti∣cular kinds of
Fruit he would have her furnish herself with. She was to let him know when
she was stock'd, and he pro∣mised to recommend her to Customers.</P>
<P>The Woman, overjoy'd at her good Fortune, went about five o'Clock
next Morning to a Gardener's, produced her Bill of Fare, on which they, judging
by her <PB N="159" REF="182"/> Appearance she could not pay for such a
Cargo, laugh'd at her. This provok'd the Pride of the new-rais'd Beggar; who,
to convince them of her Wealth, produced it to their astonish'd View; upon
which they alter'd their Note, and as it was a cold Morning, said, That 
<Q REND="inline">"Bargains were never made with dry Lips."</Q> They
drew in the poor Woman to drink plen∣tifully of 
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Brandy and Ale mixt.</NOTE>Hotpot, which
soon left her stupid in the Ale-house; but not till they had first done
her the Favour to rob her.</P>
<P>When she came a little to herself, the Woman of the House
demanded Pay∣ment; the Fellows being gone. She was going to pay the Reckoning,
but alas! her Money was gone too: It was in vain for her to enquire for it,
every-body disavowed the Fact; but the Gardener, out of his great Charity,
gave her a Basket of Windfalls, with which she was obliged, seeing no
Remedy, to return to her origi∣nal Poverty.</P>
<P>The Dean vainly look'd for the Pro∣duct of his Charity; he could
neither <PB N="160" REF="183"/> see Shop, nor Woman, for she kept out of his
way; at length he happened in Church to be seiz'd with the Cholick, and went
out in the middle of Service; and who stood at the Church-door, but the very
Person? He stopp'd, and de∣manded, why he had not heard from her, and how
she proceeded? Upon this the Woman flew into a Rage, abused him all the Way
to his own House, told him, that his cursed Money had bewitch'd her; that
all the Neighbours knew she was a modest, virtuous, sober Woman, and that
he had made her turn Whore and Drunkard; the Dean ran in, clap'd the the Door
upon her, and begged the Protection of his Domesticks against the mad
Woman.</P>
<P>And here I must observe, that as the Dean was very justly
satirical on the Vices of human Kind, yet when he fell on Infirmities, he
seem'd to have done a displeasing Act to Heaven, inasmuch as he was
punished with them all in a re∣markable manner; he lived to be a 
<PB N="161" REF="184"/> <HI>Struldbrugg,</HI> helpless as a Child, and un∣able
to assist himself.</P>
<P>I say not this as any Reflection to his sacred Memory, Heaven
forbid I should; but with all the Reverence I have for the Dean, I really
think he sometimes chose Subjects unworthy of his Muse, and which could
serve for no other End ex∣cept that of turning the Reader's Sto∣mach, as it
did my Mother's, who, upon reading the <HI>Lady's Dressing-room,</HI>
in∣stantly threw up her Dinner.</P>
<P>Here I digress, oddly enough, on a whimsical Circumstance.
Having once had the Honour of being known to Lady ******, I took the Liberty of
applying to her for a Subscription; her Neice came out, and mistaking the
Per∣son who brought the Letter for me, said, 
<Q REND="inline">"Her Lady wondered at my Impu∣dence, to apply to
her, when I knew how I had used Sir ******:"</Q> But if ever I used him, or
he me, then am I no two-legged Creature; for, to my Knowledge, I never even
saw him; if the Man did dare to contradict me, I <PB N="162" REF="185"/> wou'd
make him eat a Piece of my Pen: But how used him? not unlawfully, I hope. Did
your Ladyship ever see me lewdly lolling on a Love-bed with him? No, if we
ever met, he was supported by two reverend Prelates, proper Sup∣porters for a
Christian Hero; but I never heard that the Gentleman was addicted to Women;
so that I hope I may rest un∣censured by him, and also by your
L—p.</P>
<P>I do this, Madam, in regard to the Gentleman's Character, for my
own is of no Consequence. 
<Q> 
<L>'Tis Bare-bit, and knawn by Treason's Canker-Tooth.</L> 
<BIBL>Shakespear.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>And pray now, Sir <HI>C—,</HI> for to thee I call, but with
no friendly Voice. What time? what Day? what Hour did I ever disoblige you?
the Injuries you have done me, I freely forgive, and 
<Q> 
<L>If you please,</L> 
<L>Will honour you with Panegyrick Lays.</L></Q> 
<PB N="163" REF="186"/> But then take notice you must come down handsomely;
you are not Lord <HI>Kingsborough,</HI> nor will my Verse flow spontaneous.

<Q> 
<L>His Virtues might the humblest Bards in∣spire,</L> 
<L>And fill their Bosoms with poetick Fire.</L></Q></P>
<P>So now, for ever and for ever farewel, <HI>Brutus!</HI> if we do
meet again, why we shall laugh, if not, why surely we shall never weep; a
more inspiring Theme demands my Attention: So, Sir Knight of the Oracle,
adieu, if thou dyest be∣fore me, as you should, since you stept into
the World thirty Years e'er my dim Speck of Entity was animated; I have wrote
your Epitaph, which I beg you may have engrav'd on your Tomb-stone; lest
you should not, I will raise you a Monument more lasting than
Brass.</P>
<P>I presume, by the Information of your Boots, you have read
<HI>Horace,</HI> take your Encomium. 
<Q><PB N="164" REF="187"/> 
<L>Here lies the greatest Man that e'er was born,</L> 
<L>All Womankind sincerely did he scorn,</L> 
<L>And kept the good old Proverb in his Mind,</L> 
<L>He that won't go before—must go be∣hind.</L></Q></P>
<P>And if my Printer should dare to put a dash or blank in your
illustrious Name, I will in Capitals insert it, and you know, 
<Q> 
<L>When in bold Capitals express'd,</L> 
<L>The dullest Reader takes the Jest.</L></Q></P>
<P>This, Sir, I give you as a farther Proof of my Impudence, in which
I own your Family to have far the Superiority to mine; for though some of
them did Ex∣ecution in the well-fought Field, yet none of them were condemn'd
to suffer one: So read this, and then to Breakfast with what Appetite you
may.</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="188"/>But after all I have said, I bear you no
Ill-will; but you began with me this Tennis-game, and I have match'd my Racquet
to the Balls; and, depend on't, whoever begins with me, I bear the Motto of the
Thistle: 
<Q> 
<L>Nemo me impune lacessit.</L></Q></P>
<P>The Hour now came, when the Dean's Promise was to be claim'd; as
I brought forth a Son, I wrote to him, but he was in the Country, and in five
Days the Boy died: The Dean did not return till I was a Fortnight brought to
Bed.</P>
<P>He came directly to visit me: Mr. <HI>Pilkington</HI> open'd the
Door for him, and brought him up to me. After wishing me Joy, he asked,
where was his God∣son-elect? I told him in Heaven: The Lord be praised,
said he, I thought there was some good News in the way, your Husband look'd
so brisk: Pox take me, but I was in Hopes you were dead your∣self; but
'tis pretty well as it is, I have <PB N="166" REF="189"/> sav'd by it, and I
should have got no∣thing by you.</P>
<P>He drank a little Caudle with me, and then went away; about an
Hour after his Servant brought me a Letter, and a great Bundle of brown Paper,
sealed with the utmost Care, and twisted round with I know not how many
Yards of Pack-thread; my Curiosity led me to read the Letter before I
examined the Contents of the Paper, which, to the best of my Knowledge, was
this: 
<LETTER>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Send you a Piece of Plumb-cake, which I did intend should
be spent at your Christening; if you have any Objection to the Plumbs, or
do not like to eat them, you may return them to,</P>
<CLOSER>
<SALUTE>Madam,</SALUTE> 
<SIGNED>your sincere Friend and Servant, <HI>J.
Swift.</HI></SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER></P>
<P>I now examined the Contents of the Paper, in which I found a Piece
of Gin∣ger-bread, in which were stuck four <PB N="167" REF="190"/> Guineas,
wrapt in white Paper, on the Outside of each was wrote Plumb.</P>
<P>I sent the Dean a real Piece of Pumb cake, with this Answer: 
<LETTER>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have heard that Ostridges could digest Iron, but you
give me a harder Task, when you bid me eat Gold; but suppose I should,
like the rich Streams of the <HI>Tagus,</HI> flow potable Gold, the
Interpreta∣tion of which is, that I mean to drink your Health this Minute, in a
Glass of Sack; and am, with the utmost Respect, Sir,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your ever devoted Servant, <HI>L.
Pilkington.</HI></SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER></P>
<P>Just when he had fix'd Mr. <HI>Pilkington</HI> to be Chaplain to
Alderman <HI>Barber,</HI> the Dean received from <HI>Spain,</HI> from one Mr.
<HI>Wogan,</HI> a green Velvet Bag, in which was contained the Adventures of
<HI>Euge∣nius</HI>; as also an Account of the Court∣ship and Marriage of
the Chevalier, to the Princess <HI>Sobiesky,</HI> wherein he repre∣sents 
<PB N="168" REF="191"/> himself to have been a principal Ne∣gotiator. It was
wrote in the Novel Stile, but a little heavily: There was also some of the
Psalms of <HI>David,</HI> paraphras'd in <HI>Miltonick</HI> Verse, and a
Letter to the Dean, with Remarks on the <HI>Beggar's Opera</HI>; in which he
says he believes the People of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Ireland</HI> had
quite lost all Remains of Elegance and Taste, since their top
Entertainments were com∣posed of Scenes of Highwaymen, and Prostitutes, who
all remain unpunish'd and triumphant in their Crimes: He concluded with
paying the Dean the Compliment of intreating him to correct the Work.</P>
<P>The Dean said, he did not care to be troubled with it, and bid
Mr. <HI>Pilking∣ton</HI> take it to <HI>London,</HI> and look it over at his
Leisure, which accordingly he did.</P>
<P>He was scarce gone, when the Dean came to me for the Bag; I told
him my Husband had; according to his Com∣mands, taken it with him. He
protested he never gave him any such Permission; <PB N="169" REF="192"/>
that I was impudent to say it, and my Husband more so to do it; the
Conclu∣sion of which was; that he ordered me to write to him to return it
immedi∣ately; and, least I should forget it, he gave me a very good
Beating. Well; I writ Mr. <HI>Pilkington</HI> an Account of the Dean's Wrath,
and he sent me the fatal Bag by a Clergyman: I directly carried it to the
Dean, and hoped he would be pleased, by my punctual and ready Obedience to
his Will; but far otherwise it fell out, for the Dean flew into a
Pas∣sion, for my daring to presume to write for it, and gave me another
Beating.</P>
<P>But did not this more resemble the Actions of a Lunatick than of
a Gentle∣man of superior Wit and Knowledge? Indeed, I believe too much
Learning had turn'd his Head, or too deep a Search into the Secrets of Nature;
as nothing could escape his Observation. And this wrong Turn in his Brain,
I fancy had possessed him a long time be∣fore it was taken notice of,
as number∣less Proofs might be produced; and even <PB N="170" REF="193"/>
amongst the Facts that I have related there are some strong Instances
of it; had he been less witty, it would sooner have been taken notice of;
but, as the Poet observes, 
<Q> 
<L>Great Wit to Madness sure is near allied,</L> 
<L>And thin Partitions do their Bounds di∣vide.</L></Q></P>
<P>The first Proof he gave of his Incivility was affronting the
Lord Lieutenant, at the Lord Mayor's Table; who, because he had not paid his
Compliments to him in due Form, he very civilly accosted, by the
extraordinary Title of, you, Fellow with the blue String. Some little time
after this, he invited two Clergymen to take the Air with him, and when he got
them into a Coach, he did so belabour them and knock their Heads together,
that they were obliged to cry out for Assistance.</P>
<P>From this he fell into a deep Melan∣cholly, and knew no body; I
was told the last sensible Words he uttered, were on this Occasion: Mr.
<HI>Handel,</HI> when <PB N="171" REF="194"/> about to quit <HI>Ireland,</HI>
went to take his leave of him: The Servant was a con∣siderable Time, e'er he
could make the Dean understand him; which, when he did, he cry'd 
<Q REND="inline">"O! A <HI>German,</HI> and a Genius! A Prodigy!
admit him."</Q> The Servant did so, just to let Mr. <HI>Han∣del</HI> behold
the Ruins of the greatest Wit that ever liv'd along the Tide of Time, where
all at length are lost.</P>
<P>If ought else relating to him, should occur to my Remembrance,
I will faith∣fully relate it; as I am certain it cannot but be acceptable to
the Public, whose Interest he had evermore at Heart, and whose Liberties
on all Occasions, he warm∣ly and nobly asserted.</P>
<P>'Tis mine, O honoured Shade, to cele∣brate thy Goodness, without
extenuating thy Faults; I deal impartially, which is the true Task of an
Historian, and I would inscribe thy Tomb-Stone, were I permitted; but
without Characters, Fame lives long. Thine will last, while Wit or Genius are
admired in this sublunary Globe.</P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="195"/>However disagreeable it may be to me, I
find I must prosecute my own History, till my leaving <HI>London,</HI> to
which Metro∣polis I never intend to return, as has been insinuated, in order
to hurt my Subscrip∣tion: While ever I can find Means of subsisting in
my native Country, where I have received more Favour, than I could reasonably
hope for, I should esteem my∣self not only ungrateful, but unjust to
raise Contributions on the Public, and carry the Money from this poor
Island, to spend it in a rich and opulent City.</P>
<P>Besides my Days of Vanity are over. The Woods, Groves,
Fountains, sacred Recesses, dear to the Muses, would be my Choice, even
had I a Fortune to entitle me to enjoy the Splendor of a Court in its utmost
Magnificence. O how I languish for Retirement; even as the Heart pant∣eth
after the Water Brooks, so longeth my Soul after it; where I might sit upon
sunless Side of some Romantic Moun∣tain, Forest crown'd. I wish my
best and dearest Friend, would take this into Con∣sideration, and in
some Part of his wide <PB N="173" REF="196"/> extended Domains, afford his
Muse an humble Hermitage.</P>
<P>I should not then be distracted with Fears of an imperious
Landlord's Threats. No; your happy Tenant would pay her Debt in Weeds, which,
when I once told your Lordship, you very politely answered, that such
Verses as mine were the finest Flowers in the Garden of the Muses.</P>
<P>I must here relate to your Lordship, a little Circumstance
which happened to me lately. I took a Lodging in <HI>Drum∣condra-lane</HI>; the
two Ladies, (Sisters) who keep the House, kindly invited me to Dinner; it
was very natural for me to enquire what Persons of Distinction lived in our
Neighbourhood; they told me Lord <HI>Kingsborough</HI> had lately purchased a
House in it, a most worthy fine Gen∣tleman. I happened to express so
much Pleasure, at hearing this agreeable piece of News, and at the same
time so warm∣ly joined in their Sentiments, that one of the Ladies said:
Well, Madam, though you have made a Mystery of your Name, 
<PB N="174" REF="197"/> I am certain you are Mrs. <HI>Pilkington</HI>; I am
sure you are the Person; because you speak of his Lordship, in the
very same Stile you have wrote of him. I have the two Volumes.</P>
<P>As I found they were prepossessed in Mrs.
<HI>Pilkington</HI>'s Favour, I confess'd they had guess'd right. But
whenever I want Concealment, if your Lordship is men∣tioned, I will take Care
to be silent. Otherwise I shall soon betray myself, as out of the
Abundance of the Heart, the Mouth speaketh. Though I am afraid, that like
holy David, it would be Grief, and Pain to me, and while I sat musing the
Fire would kindle; the Sacred Fire of Friendship and Gratitude, would un∣lock
my Tongue and give me Utterance, even though I had been born dumb.</P>
<P>Why, my dear Lord, were but a few Persons of Distinction, in
your Way of thinking, Earth itself would become a Paradise: no more would
the sorrowful Sighing of the Prisoner, nor the Voice of Lamentation be
heard in our Streets, and 'tis with infinite Pleasure, I see our long 
<PB N="175" REF="198"/> stain'd Nobility, <HI>who were only fa∣mous for
undoing,</HI> and built their <HI>Characters on Rapes and Ruin,</HI> now
al∣most to a Man, not only just, but bene∣ficent; not only learned
themselves, but Encouragers of Science in others. If a∣mongst our Country's
Worthies, I name you Lord <HI>Molesworth,</HI> who have distin∣guished
yourself in Fields and Senates, in the Seats of the Muses, and Academic
Groves; whose well try'd Valour has ap∣proved itself; not in Rashness,
but a noble Intrepidity and Scorn of Death, whenever your God, your King, or
Coun∣try, requir'd your Service; I hope it will not offend you, to say, may
your God, your King, and Country, make you as happy, as my much obliged, and
most truly grateful Heart sincerely wishes, shall ever be my ardent
Prayer.</P>
<P>Your Lordship has kindly visited the Virtues of my Father on
his Daughter. I am sure I had no other Claim, to the Fa∣vours or Honours for
which I am indebt∣ed to your Lordship, and for which I rest your faithful
Servant.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="199"/>At length, through strange
Vicissitudes, and Variety of Misfortunes, finding I could get no Relief
from <HI>Ireland,</HI> I de∣termined, with my Son, to revisit it; and though
late in Life, try my Fortune in <HI>Hibernia.</HI> But how to compass a
Journey and a Voyage without Money, was really a difficult Task; to this End
I set my Wits to Work, to find out whether any Persons of my own Country
were in <HI>Lon∣don,</HI> from whom, by revealing my Dis∣tress, I could
hope for Relief. At length I learned, that Dr. <HI>Delany</HI> was there, who
never rejected the Petition of the af∣flicted, even though they had no other
Merit to recommend them, but that of Anguish. My Suit was granted in the
most compassionate and obliging Manner; accompanied by his Tears for my
Mis∣fortunes, and Prayers for the Preserva∣tion of my Soul and Body. And
sure the Oraisons of one so good, must have uncommon Efficacy in them,
to turn the Sinner, and confirm the Just in well-doing, while his own Example
strengthens all his Precepts.</P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="200"/>How different was the Reception I met with,
at the Hands of this worthy Man, from the rough Return made to my
Sollicitations, for a Subscription from Lady ****; who, 
<Q REND="inline">"wondered at my <HI>Impudence</HI> in applying to
her."</Q></P>
<P>Ladies, let me entreat you will drop that nasty paw Word
<HI>impudent,</HI> at least don't annex it to my Name, who never yet had the
Assurance to appear in any publick Place, since I came last to this
Kingdom; nor ever to apply in Person for a Favour. But a Woman who has
suffered in Reputation, knows not what to do; 'tis all Impudence, though her
Betters have more; for that in the Cap∣tain is but a Choleric Word, which in
the Soldier is flat Blasphemy.</P>
<P>Upon my Word, if instead of the Im∣pudence I am charged with;
you would call me a desolate afflicted Wretch, you would speak the Truth;
for poor <HI>Laetitia</HI> is become the Foot-ball of Fortune; but why should
I complain? when the Son of Man says, that the Foxes had Holes, and he
himself had no Place to lay his Head <PB N="178" REF="201"/> in! Answer me
some of ye great, learned, and pious Divines; why is our Blessed Redeemer
stiled the Son of Man? When we are told, that a Virgin should conceive;
that the Power of the highest should over-shadow her! How was he then the
Son of Man? We are all order∣ed to apply to our Heavenly Father, and therefore
may stile ourselves the Children of God; why then is there any Excep∣tion
made in this Case?</P>
<P>I hardly dare allow myself the Liberty of thinking, lest I
should do it too deep∣ly, and Reason be my Disease; and yet I believe
it was given me to follow and search after Truth; where then shall I find
it? not on Earth, no more than Peace or Justice, who are long fled from
these lower Regions. Boldly then let me pursue them, even to the high
Place, from whence they sprung; the Seat of Calms and Ease, the Mansions
of the Blest, where holy Hope and constant Faith, shall be lost in
Fruition of that Happiness, which hath not yet entered into the Heart of Man
to conceive.</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="202"/>Mr. <HI>Woolaston</HI>'s Religion of
Nature delineated, shews us powerfully, how much a Lye must offend the
Creator; as I am tax'd with numerous Quotations, which are tedious (as some
of my Readers tell me) I shall not borrow one from him, but refer the Learned
to his inimitable Work; though I am persuaded, no Per∣son who has not a
clear Head, can taste his Beauties: And truly, I have paid myself no
small Compliment here; but, as it is written, e'en let it pass.</P>
<P>And here, Mr. <HI>Blake</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ignatius

more re∣vere your every amiable Quality than I do, yet as the Objection you
started to my Philosophic Doctrine, of the Ocean's having no Bottom, has
deprived me of Rest ever since, I could find in my Heart to be angry with
you; You asked me then, how I could account for Islands, which must have
a Foundation? I am not sure of that, perhaps they float like <HI>Delos.</HI>
'Tis demonstrable that wherever we dig <PB N="180" REF="203"/> deep, we find

Deep: This was so at the first Creation; then, when the Windows of Heaven
were opened, and the deep Abyss or Receptacle of Waters broke up; what had we
but the Ruins of a World to inhabit, the Fragments of which may swim; at

Well, now you have reminded me of it, I think I will. To confess the Truth, I
had like to have forgotten myself; my Thoughts are apt to wander through

was sufficient to pay every Debt I ow'd in <HI>London</HI>; which, as I was
cautious in contracting any, a Sum, though less, would have paid. But I had
not a Sufficiency to answer the Expence of travelling Charges, for two
Persons. The Parliament was dissolved, the Nobi∣lity gone to enjoy the
Sweets of Spring, <HI>April</HI> having deck'd all Things in fresh and
fragrant Bloom; all, but wretched Humankind, from whom, whence part∣ed, it no
more returns, to blush or beau∣tify <PB N="183" REF="206"/> the Cheek again.
But let us not Sor∣row after that, as those who have no Hope beyond this
Life; if we can go unstain'd through this World, which 'tis almost
impossible to do, or seeing the Er∣rors of our Ways, forsake them; we
have Assurance given us, of a joyful and tri∣umphant Resurrection.

I wrote, in order to gain Relief, to a Prelate of <HI>Ireland,</HI> then
resident in <HI>Lon∣don</HI>; <PB N="184" REF="207"/> I sent the Letter by
the Daughter of a dissenting Clergyman, of whose Ho∣nour and Virtue I was
confident. He re∣ceived her civilly, read over my Letter, and declared he did
not know me; but as he had some slight Knowledge of my Fa∣mily, there was a
Guinea for me. This answered no End: But yet he gave me some Comfort, by
bidding her call again, and he would think of something for my Service:
Accordingly, in a Week's Time she went again, and again; till at length his
Lordship vouchsafed to send out a very rough Answer, not in the least
befitting his Function or Dignity, espe∣cially to one whom he knew from her
Infancy, to be a Woman of good Birth, and Education.</P>
<P>But I resolving to be as chuffy as he, sent him in reality
another Epistle, not over-courteous I own; yet it wrought a better Effect,
than my complaining one produced, for his Gentleman came to me early next
Morning, with a very civil Letter; and produced ten Guineas, to my
unspeakable Joy; but there was a Draw∣back <PB N="185" REF="208"/> on my
Happiness, for I was obli∣ged to return ten Shillings Change, which I very
reluctantly complied with.</P>
<P>With this Sum my Son and I quitted <HI>London,</HI> and being on
the saving Scheme, took Places in the Waggon. A most tire∣some Way of
travelling! <HI>May</HI> Morning we set forth, our Slow-pac'd Cattle were
adorned with Ribbands and Flowers, and till then, I never understood the
meaning of the vulgar Expression, of being as fine as a Horse, for it
seems it is customary on this Month, to present the Waggoners with a
Ribband, at every Inn; till our Flea-bitten Nags, were almost blind∣ed by the
tawdry party-coloured flow∣ing Honours of their Heads. I was really almost
fatigued to Death, for I was called up at three o'Clock in the Morn∣ing, though
perhaps you don't set out till five. Tea or Coffee, none to be had, unless
in some of the Towns: Indeed, if I could, like our Driver, have eat a
Breakfast of Salt Beef and Cabbage at that squeamish Hour, it was laid
there ready. They bait not all Day; so one <PB N="186" REF="209"/> might have
an Appetite by Evening, but it happened not so to me. The Heat and Dust
quite depriv'd me of any Inclina∣tion to Food, and especially to the rough
Fare provided.</P>
<P>My chief Delight was listening to the Nightingale, who then
warbled forth her love-laboured Song, to indulge the Pleasure of hearing the
soft Warbler, pour forth her plaintive and harmonious Lay: I used when we
were near our resting Place, to alight and walk through the flower-enamell'd
Meads, filled with Cowslips, Primroses, and wild Violets, for 
<Q> 
<L>In rural Scenes the Soul of Beauty reigns,</L> 
<L>The Soul of Pleasure lives in rural Scenes.</L> 
<BIBL>POPE.</BIBL></Q> My Son and I found out a sweet Place,
canopy'd with Wood-bine, which had enringed itself in Plats about a large
Ap∣ple Tree, whose Blossoms shed Perfumes, while the whole Season
warbled round our <PB N="187" REF="210"/> Heads; we seated ourselves under
the wide spreading Shade, listening with De∣light to those wild
Musicians. Suddenly the Boy cry'd out, O Mamma what shall I do? What is the
Matter, Child? Look at my Leg: I did so, and behold a Snake had twisted up
it; I, though heartily startled, had Presence of Mind sufficient, to beg
he would not strike it; he took my Advice, though indeed both he and I were
ready to faint, and the evil Worm crawled away, without doing him any
Prejudice. But not being well assured that all the Serpent Race, sworn
Foe to Man, might be so complaisant, I was never after tempted to sit
down in Albion's fruitful Fields.</P>
<P>We lodged this Night at a strange old Village, whose Name I
have forgot; I believe the Inn had formerly been a Con∣vent, by the numerous
little Cells and Cloysters, small Windows, almost dar∣kened with
Jessamine and Vines; it had a most romantic melancholy Air, fit for
studious Contemplation, but not reple∣nished with rich Repast, or
chearful <PB N="188" REF="211"/> Wine. The next Day being Sunday, a Day of
Rest, we took up our Quarters at another Inn, where we got a Chicken and a
Pint of Wine, and lived sumptu∣ously.</P>
<P>We then walk'd out to see what kind of Curiosity this Place
afforded, worth Remark; but finding none, we strayed out on a Common, when
the first Object which struck my Sight, was that of a Man suspended
high in the Air, hanging in Chains on a Gibbet; shocking as it was, it
engaged my Attention; I concluded he must have been a most undutiful Son,
when the Birds of Prey had devoured him, and the Ravens picked out his Eyes.
Suddenly I was surprized with the Voice of a Man, who cried, O my dear
Coshen Paddy, I wish those who put you there for noting, were there
themselves. I look∣ed about, and saw fifteen or twenty Men and Women lying
in a dry Ditch; I would have fled, but considering that might not be safe,
I rather chose to walk at an easy Pace: One of the Fellows made up to us,
and asked where we were <PB N="189" REF="212"/> going; I told him to our
Country, <HI>Ire∣land.</HI> Arah, said he, are you a Catolic? I said I was!
Upon I which he said, Faith poor Paddy <HI>Lawler,</HI> who hangs there was a
good one. And what, Sir, brought him to so unfortunate an End? Why, said
he, he was in Love with a proud scornful Hussey, and she slighted
him, so he met her in this Plaish, and because she would not accept of
his Shivility, he lent her a Nock on the Head, and so he got his Will of her.
She died the next Day, after she had given Information against him; to be
sure her Skull was broke, but he did not deshine that.</P>
<P>While he was telling me this Story, I trembled, but made the
best Speed I could to the Village, being infinitely more frightened at him,
than I had been at the Snake. He accompanied us there, for which I return∣ed
him Thanks; how sincerely my Readers may judge. But I made a Virtue of
Ne∣cessity, and gave him fair Words. Now said he, are not all these
Heretics damn'd Rogues? Ay, said I, and I hope our <PB N="190" REF="213"/>
true King will put all Villains to Death. Arrah, give me your Fist for that;
I was obliged to comply. When I got to the Inn I told him, I should be glad
of his Company, but that I had a jealous Hus∣band, who would certainly kill
me, if he found any Man in my Company. Damn the Rogue, said he, if I was as
you, I would make him a Cuckold in a crack. I desired he would please to
accept of a Pot of Drink, which he did, and making a Leg, walk'd off leaving us
unmolest∣ed, and I blest God I had purchased Life at so cheap a
Rate.</P>
<P>That soft Answers turn away Wrath, is most assured; for
I remember some Years ago, when the <HI>Cavan</HI> Rabble were up in Arms, my
Mother, Sister, and I, went to pay a Visit at <HI>Rathfarnam,</HI> to the
Lady of our excellent 
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eaton Stannard, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> who
resigned.</NOTE>Recorder. On our return home, we were surrounded by a Pack
of these Wretches, who ordered my Father's Coachman to pull off his Hat to
them, which he refusing, and they be∣ing <PB N="191" REF="214"/> all armed
with short thick Oak Tree Clubs, they swore we should not ride in a
Coach, and they walk; my Mother, with surprizing Presence of Mind, said
Gentlemen, you are very welcome to the Coach, my Daughter and I will walk, to
oblige you with it; which, Villains, Ruf∣fians, and Murtherers as they were,
they would not permit, but only desired we might Huzza for them, this
notwith∣standing our Terror, we chearfully did; and my Mother said,
Gentlemen per∣haps you are dry, and gave them a Crown, with which they were
so well pleased, that they huzza'd for us, offering to guard us safe to
Town; but she alledging that would be too much trouble, they left us with a
kind Assurance, that they would drink our Healths, and fight for us any
Time we stood in need of their Pro∣tection.</P>
<P>Nothing material happened to us till we got to <HI>Chester</HI>;
we took a Survey of the Cathedral Church, which had nothing like Beauty to
recommend it, any more <PB N="192" REF="215"/> than the old black Walls which
environ Part of the City.</P>
<P>Next Day we set out for <HI>Parkgate,</HI> which was crowded
with Nobility and Gentry, waiting for a fair Wind; here we were so long
detained, that my Purse was quite exhausted, even my last Shilling gone;
this was a sad Situation, we were fixed to a Point without any Power of
Moving one way or another, wanting the necessary Agent Money. There was but
one Way left, which was even to apply to Lady <HI>Kildare,</HI> who was there;
but being ashamed to do it in my Name, I e'en did it in my Son's, who waited
on her Ladyship with it, met a favourable Reception, and brought home a
Guinea. The Wind sprung up fair and we embar∣ked on board the Race Horse.
As I am always deadly Sick at Sea, I chose to keep on Deck, as long as I
possibly could. My Son being well inured to the wat'ry Ele∣ment, skipped
about, and sung Marine Songs. Most of the Passengers went to their
Cabbins, when Mr. <HI>Hudson,</HI> the Clergyman, seeing my Boy speak to
me, <PB N="193" REF="216"/> asked me, was not that young Lad's Name
<HI>Pilkington?</HI> I said Yes! I thought so said he, for he is very
like Mr. <HI>Pilking∣ton</HI> the Clergyman; he has some Cause to be so,
Sir, for he is his Son. How can you answer for that, Madam? Why in∣deed, Sir,
I have some Cause of Knowledge of it, for I am that worthy Divine's Wife,
and the Boy's Mother. The Gentleman confessed the Force of my Plea, and
ex∣pressed great Compassion for us both; and I do verily believe, had
he known our Circumstances, he would have added Re∣lief to Pity.</P>
<P>He seemed to be a learned and worthy Gentleman, which I had the
better Op∣portunity of discovering, as he, my Son, myself, and a Gentleman
whom I did not know, sat all Night in Lady <HI>Kildare</HI>'s Coach, which
was lash'd upon Deck. We there were becalm'd, and amongst other things, Mr.
<HI>Hudson</HI> said, that had he ever been so unfortunate to take a
common Woman, and she had brought forth a Son so like him, as mine was to 
<PB N="194" REF="217"/> my Husband, he would at least have con∣cluded that
to be his own.</P>
<P>Upon which I related to him a true Story. A Servant Maid who had
lived with Mr. <HI>Pilkington</HI> in <HI>Ireland,</HI> enquired of the
Persons who kept the next House, who were the new Lodgers they had got; the
Name made her but more inquisitive, and she begg'd I would permit her to
see me, but as I had met with many a Trick in Life, I bid my Son and Daughter
sit behind the Bed Curtain, and then desir'd her to come up; I asked her,
did she know me; she said no indeed! but she had lived with one Mr.
<HI>Pilkington</HI> in <HI>Ireland,</HI> who had turn'd his Wife out of Doors;
and that he lived on <HI>Lazer</HI>'s <HI>Hill.</HI> And what said I were the
Names of the Chil∣dren? Why, returned she, there was Master <HI>Billy,</HI>
Miss <HI>Betty,</HI> and Master <HI>Jack!</HI> And how came you to leave
him? Why, indeed he was beating Miss and Master sadly, and I asked him
why he did it? he said because they were none of his! <PB N="195" REF="218"/> Oh, Sir, said I, sure Master Jack is yours, for he is your own
Picture. Ay, said he, the Mother was thinking of me when he was got. In
troth, Sir, said she, I don't doubt that, for I believe you were the
nearest Person to her; for which Offence, she was directly
dismissed: And could he have found Matter against her Life, he would
have prosecuted her.</P>
<P>The Children knew her, and whatever little Favours she had by
Stealth done for them in my Exile, I did my utmost to re∣turn to her. A
Benefit is seldom lost.</P>
<P>At length the Day broke and dis∣covered us my native Earth; I
hail'd the Mother Land which gave me Birth, but knowing how little Money I had,
did not chuse to Land at <HI>Dunlary,</HI> which must be attended with more
Expence, than I had any Possibility of answering: The other
Passengers all went ashore; 'twas about three o'Clock, and my Boy and I
waited in the Ship, not doubting but we should be soon at
<HI>Ringsend</HI>; but it happened <PB N="196" REF="219"/> otherwise, for we
were becalm'd; we once more took our Seats in the Coach, and found there the
Hammer Cloth, in which I wrapt myself, and fell fast asleep. In the Night
I was awaked by the terrible Curses of the Captain of the Ship, who swore
dreadfully we should be that Mo∣ment lost. I dropt the Glass, and asked
him what was the Matter; he said he had fallen asleep, and trusted the
Ship to one who had directly thrown us on the <HI>North Bull.</HI> And are we
then to be lost? I see no Remedy, we shall strike in a Minut<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> I pulled my Son, who laughed at my
Fears, which really were very great. The Ship struck upon a Sand-Bank, with
such Force, that it rebounded on another, and beat it almost to Pieces.
However, the Morn arose, that gilded all the flowery Plains, and presented
to our View a most agreeable Prospect, both of Land and Water; the Tide
left our Ship on the Strand, so that without Expence or Dif∣ficulty, we
walked to <HI>Ringsend.</HI></P>
<P>Here we took a little decent Lodging, till I could be able to
remove to <HI>Dublin</HI>; <PB N="197" REF="220"/> and I immediately
dispatched my Son, with a Letter to a Nobleman, whom I had formerly seen at
my Father's; who obligingly sent me a Guinea: This en∣abled me to dismiss
my Lodging; my Son brought me a Coach, in which we put our Portmanteau, and
remov'd to an Apartment he had taken for me at a small Rent in
<HI>Aungier-street.</HI></P>
<P>Well, Reader, I have now brought you with me to <HI>Hibernia</HI>;
where you will suppose the Daughter of a Gentleman so universally
esteemed, as Doctor <HI>Van Lewin,</HI> would, after so long an Exile, have
sure∣ly found some Friends.</P>
<P>I wrote a very mannerly Epistle to my beloved Spouse, in which
I slightly men∣tioned his merciless Treatment of me, and his poor Children;
and told him, that if he would pay me the Sixty five Pounds, for which I had
his Bond in Counsellor <HI>Smith</HI>'s Hands, I would not only forego the
Interest, which amounted to a considerable Sum, but also immedi∣ately
leave the Kingdom; provided also, he would give me Assurance, that he 
<PB N="198" REF="221"/> would take Care of his youngest Son. I leave every
Person of Candour, to judge whether or not this was a fair Proposal: And I
most solemnly protest to Almighty God, that I had no other intention, as
there was not at that Time, above forty Pages of my First Volume wrote;
how∣ever he scorned to send me an Answer of any kind. Well, I wrote
again, yet still his Reverence was silent as the Grave.</P>
<P>This I confess a little incensed me; and first determined me
in the Design, of publickly vindicating my Innocence, and laying open, for
universal Benefit, his unparallel'd Character; in which, if I have err'd,
'tis through Tenderness, as his Actions, 
<Q> 
<L>Call Virtue Hypocrite,</L> 
<L>Pluck the fair Rose from a young inno∣cent Love,</L> 
<L>And plant a Blister there.—</L> 
<BIBL>SHAKESPEAR.</BIBL></Q> I wrote to Counsellor
<HI>Smith,</HI> and told him how Mr. <HI>Pilkington</HI> had treated me, 
<PB N="199" REF="222"/> and withal informed him, that if he had too much Lenity
to sue him for my law∣ful Right, I insisted on his delivering me the
Bond, that I might put it in Force, for the Relief of myself and my
Child.</P>
<P>The Counsellor was at a Loss how to act in so critical a
Point. He knew Mr. <HI>Pilkington</HI>'s Talent, of traducing every Person,
who did not act in Compliance to his Inclination; and, on the other Hand,
Justice compell'd him to think I had a Right to be paid, what had so long
and so unlawfully been withheld from me; and by which I was drove to such
Extremi∣ties in <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>He therefore wrote to him, and I sup∣pose acquainted him, how
much it was out of his Power, as an honest Man, to defend him from the
Consequences of that Bond. Mr. <HI>Pilkington</HI> finding all his Policy of
no Effect in this particular Af∣fair, condescended to honour the
Coun∣sellor with a most stupid Epistle, in which he insinuated, 
<Q REND="inline">"that his Motive for giv∣ing that Bond, was in
order to make me live virtuously for the future, which <PB N="200" REF="223"/>
he could sufficiently prove I had not done."</Q> [Produce your Evidence Mr.
Parson.] 
<Q REND="inline">"That if he was allow'd only such Time to pay
it, as his Circum∣stances would not allow, he would try what Remedy he could
obtain from a Court of Equity, when a full State of the Case was laid before
them."</Q> These are pretty near the Words; I wish you had my dear
Spouse, as it must have gi∣ven Pleasure to any Court, to see you look
CONSCIENCE in the Face.</P>
<P>But not to be tedious, after much Trou∣ble and Vexation of Spirit,
I procured from him twenty Pounds at one Payment, with which I took a little
rural Habitation near <HI>Bow-Bridge.</HI></P>
<P>I wrote a Letter to my dear old Friend, Mr. <HI>Cibber,</HI> and
told him, that however improbable it might seem to him, I had actually Twenty
Pounds in my Pocket; and added, that I had 
<Q> 
<L>A little Room to lodge a Friend,</L> 
<L>A River at my Garden's End,</L></Q> <PB N="201" REF="224"/> and
wanted nothing, but the Delights of his Conversation, to make my Situation
com∣pleatly agreeable. I believe Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI> had not till then heard of
my Expedition, so that my Letter must have surpriz'd him. By the return
of the Post, I re∣ceived from his dear Hand the following humorous Epistle.

<LETTER>
<HEAD>To Mrs. <HI>Laetitia Pilkington,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THOU frolicksome Farce of For∣tune: What! is there then
ano∣ther Act to come of you yet? I thought you had some Time ago, made your
final Exit. Well, but without Wit or Com∣pliment, I am glad to hear you are
so tolerably alive. I have your agreeable Narrative from <HI>Dublin</HI>
before me, and shall, as you desire, answer every Para∣graph in its Turn,
without once consider∣ing its Importance or Connection. In the first Place,
you say I have for many Years been the kind Preserver of your Life. In
this, I think I have no great Merit, as you seemed to set so little
Va∣lue on it yourself, otherwise you would <PB N="202" REF="225"/> have
considered, that Poverty was the most helpless Handmaid, that ever
wait∣ed on a high spirited Lady. You seem to have a Glimpse of a new
World before you; think a little how you are to squeeze through the Crowd,
with such a Bundle at your Back, and do not suppose it pos∣sible, you
can have a Grain of Wit, till you have twenty Pounds clear in your Pocket; with
half that Sum, a greater Sinner than you, may look the Devil in the Face.</P>
<P>Few People of Sense will turn their Backs on a Woman of Wit,
that does not look as if she came to borrow Money of them; but when Want
brings her to her Wit's End, every Fool will have Wit enough to avoid her.</P>
<P>I am not sure your Spouse's having ta∣ken another Wife,
before you came over, might not have proved the only Means, of his becoming a
better Husband to you; for had he pick'd up a Fortune, the Hush of your
Prior Claim to him, might have been worth a better separate 
<PB N="203" REF="226"/> Maintenance, than what you are now like∣ly to get out of
him.</P>
<P>As to my Health and Spirits, they are as usual, and full as
strong as any body's that has enjoy'd them the same Number of Years.</P>
<P>If the Value I have for you, gives you any Credit in your own
Country, pray stretch it as far as you think it can be ser∣viceable to you;
for under all the Rubbish of your Misfortunes, I could see your Merit
sparkle like a lost Jewel. I have no greater Pleasure, than in placing my
Esteem on those, who can feel and value it. Had you been born to a large
For∣tune, your shining Qualities might have put half the rest of your Sex
out of Coun∣tenance. If any of them are uncharitable enough to call this
Flattery, tell them what a poor Devil you are, and let that silence them.</P>
<P>I hope you have but one Volume of your Works in the Press,
because if it meets with any Success, I believe I could give you some
natural Hints, which, in <PB N="204" REF="227"/> the easy Dress of your Pen,
might a good deal enliven it.</P>
<P>You pay your Court very ill to me, by depreciating the natural
Blessings on your Side the Water: Pray what have we to boast off, that
you want, but Wealth and insolent Dominion? Are not the Glory of God's
Creation there?—Woman, lovely Woman there, in their highest Lustre! I
have seen several and frequent Samples of them here; and have heard of
many, not only from yourself, but others, who for the agreeable
Enter∣tainments of social Life, have not their equal Play-Fellows in <HI>Old
England.</HI></P>
<P>And pray what would Life be worth without them? Dear soft
Souls, for now too they are lavish of Favours, which in my Youth, they would
have trembled to trust me with. In a Word, if instead of the Sea, I had
only the dry Ground <HI>Alps</HI> to get over, I should think it but a Trip
to <HI>Dublin</HI>; in the mean time, we must even compound for such
Interviews, as the Post or Packet can bring or send, to</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your real Friend and Servant, <HI>C.
Cibber.</HI></SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER></P>
<P><PB N="205" REF="228"/>I communicated this Letter to Lord Chief
Baron <HI>Bowes,</HI> the Hon. <HI>Arthur Hill,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> and
several Persons of Taste, who were infinitely delighted with it, as they
were with many others, which I had from Mr. <HI>Cibber,</HI> and which would
con∣siderably have embelished my Work, had I not the Misfortune to lose
them, by lending them to a Man of Distinction, who by some Accident
mislaid them; so I must e'en entertain you, with the neat Product of my
own Brain.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Victor,</HI> whom I have mentioned in my Second Volume,
and who is now Treasurer of the Theatre Royal in <HI>Smock-Alley,</HI> came
to visit me several Times, and frequently favoured us with an Order to
see the Play, as we were upon a very friendly and familiar Footing. My Son
used, when he had an Inclination, to call on my Friend for a Pass; one
Night he sent once or twice for that Purpose, when the Gentleman was
abroad? What does the giddy Creature do, but aukwardly counterfeits his Hand in
an Order for two. He told me of it, and said he was <PB N="206" REF="229"/>
sure Mr. <HI>Victor</HI> would not deny it, when he was informed who had
taken that Free∣dom with his Name: I laugh'd at the Reflection of the Jest,
when it came to be known, as Mr. <HI>Victor</HI> had had the Boy in his Arms
when an Infant. Ac∣cordingly we took a Coach, went to the Play, and the Forgery
seem'd to pass ex∣tremely well. The first Act was scarce begun, when a
Person entered, and as the House was thin of Company, tapt my Son on the
Shoulder. I did not apprehend the Cause of it, but began to grow uneasy
when I found him stay a full Hour; at length he returned, and informed me,
that he had been, at the Instigation of Mr. <HI>Sh—n,</HI> arrested
by two Constables, from whom he was only delivered by the Sollicitations of
Mr. <HI>Victor.</HI> This greatly astonished me, as I thought Mr.
<HI>Sh—n</HI> ought to have had a little more Respect for the Son of a
Clergyman, especially as he was well convinced, that as I knew his Father,
(whom <HI>the Dean</HI> entertained more as a Buffoon, than a Friend or
Com∣panion) and his Mother, I had a Power <PB N="207" REF="230"/> of
furnishing the World with some Anec∣dotes, which were hitherto unrevealed;
but the Scheme of letting my Son escape was not any Lenity in him, but a Bait
to catch me going out, whom they imagined they should discover by the Boy;
but it happened that a Gentleman handed me me out, by which this generous
Intent was frustrated.</P>
<P>His little deformed Brother had the Assurance to tell my Son
some Nights after, that Mr. <HI>S—n</HI> would esteem any Satire I
wrote on him a Panegyrick; which when I heard, in order to oblige him with a
Compliment to his Taste, I inclos'd to Mr. <HI>Victor</HI> the following
Lines, to be forwarded to his Mightiness. 
<Q> 
<LG>
<HEAD>To Mr. S—n.</HEAD>
<L>FAIN would the Muse record thy Crimes,</L>
<L>And leave them to succeeding Times;</L>
<L>But finds it difficult to trace,</L>
<L>The Vices of thy motly Race;</L>
<L>Whether thy Insolence and Pride,</L>
<L>Spring from thy S—l Father's Side.</L>
<L><PB N="208" REF="231"/>That Pedant, who with Rod in Hand,</L>
<L>Could in his paultry School command,</L>
<L>And underneath his cruel Yoke;</L>
<L>Many a generous Spirit broke;</L>
<L>Who else were form'd in Camps to shine,</L>
<L>Or grace the Noble Patriot Line:</L>
<L>Or didst thou from thy Dam inherit,</L>
<L>Thy fordid avaricious Spirit,</L>
<L>Of whom I heard old SWIFT declare,</L>
<L>So many Vices were her Share,</L>
<L>That were her Sex created all,</L>
<L>Pure as the first before the Fall;</L>
<L>And but her Crimes thro' all distributed,</L>
<L>The best would merit to be gibbeted.</L>
<L>Thy Father he applauded next,</L>
<L>Studying a Wench more than a Text;</L>
<L>Who having got of Money store,</L>
<L>Lavishing all upon a Whore,</L>
<L>Was sent to Hell, his latest Journey,</L>
<L>By her base Brother an Attorney;</L>
<L>Such be thy Fate, thou Wretch accurs'd,</L>
<L>Or else with Spleen and Envy burst;</L>
<L>Or with thine Uncle, brave <HI>M'Faddin,</HI></L>
<L>Whose Infamy thy Soul is clad in,</L>
<L><PB N="209" REF="232"/>To free the suffering Stage and
Nation,</L>
<L>Be doom'd like him to Transportation.</L>
<L>But who thy Destiny can alter?</L>
<L>Thy very Looks, presage a Halter.</L>
<L>Oh may I live to hail the Day,</L>
<L>When the glad Players shall survey,</L>
<L>Their Tyrant stript of all Command,</L>
<L>High on the well fixt Ladder stand.</L>
<L>And taking thence, one glorious Swing,</L>
<L>How will they spout, "God save the King?"</L>
<L>Then shall those Cloaths, in which disguise,</L>
<L>You'd seem a Lord to vulgar Eyes.</L>
<L>Did not thy base and abject Mien,</L>
<L>Betray the Beggar's Brat within,</L>
<L>Be by thy Kinsman Hangman worn,</L>
<L>And still a Scoundrel Thief adorn.</L>
</LG></Q> This, Sir, I most humbly beg your Ac∣ceptance of, as
'tis indeed the only thing which I could without Dissimulation say of
you.</P>
<P>I was told, that this worthy Gentleman, in a Letter to the
inimitable Mr. <HI>Garrick,</HI> said, 
<Q REND="inline">"We shine like <HI>Castor</HI> and
<HI>Pollux,</HI> <PB N="210" REF="233"/> you adorn <HI>Great Britain,</HI> while
I illu∣minate <HI>Hibernia.</HI>"</Q> Nothing sure, but his matchless
Ignorance, could have drawn so disproportionate a Parrallel. I remem∣ber
the first time I had the Pleasure of seeing Mr. <HI>Garrick</HI> perform,
it was the Character of King <HI>Lear</HI>; I was in one of the Boxes, and when
he came to the mad Scene, I was so much affected at it, that I got up
insensibly, and was going out, till I was wak'd, like one from a Trance, by
the Lady who accompanied me, pull∣ing me by the Sleeve, and demanding where I
was going? and to say the Truth, 
<Q> 
<L>He made me Marble, with too much conceiving.</L> 
<BIBL>MILTON.</BIBL></Q> I am certain no Person was ever
capable of making the Audience feel a Part, which they did not sincerely do
themselves; and I'm convinced, Mr. <HI>Garrick</HI> never play'd a Part,
wherein he did not, through the whole Performance, believe himself the Man;
whereas <HI>Pollux,</HI> as <HI>Sh—n</HI> <PB N="211" REF="234"/>
modestly stiles himself, is no other than Tom <HI>Sh—n,</HI> though
he change Dress and Perriwig twenty Times a Night; he is indeed, <HI>Semper
Eadem, worse</HI> and <HI>worse,</HI> as my Countryman has it.</P>
<P>This brings to my Memory, a Story of a very eminent Player, who
was to perform the Part of <HI>Hannibal.</HI> A Nobleman behind the Scenes,
took the Liberty to give a Twitch to one Tye of his Peruke. The enraged Hero
turned on his Heel, and with his martial Trun∣cheon, smote the Peer over the
Cheek. 
<Q> 
<L>A Blow, by Heaven! and from an Actor's Hand!</L> 
<L>He did not stab him, for that were poor Revenge.</L></Q> But
when he came off the Stage, my Lord told him, he believed he thought himself
really <HI>Hannibal,</HI> when he could give with Impunity, such an
Indignity, to a Man of his Consequence. My Lord, said the Player, if I did
not think myself <HI>Hannibal,</HI> I should never be able to make 
<PB N="212" REF="235"/> the Audience do so.—So much for Theatrical
Affairs.</P>
<P>I now began seriously to resolve on Publishing my
Writings, and to that End had Proposals printed. Persons were at first a
little timorous, lest I should print a List of Subscribers, and by that
Means they might unwittingly give Of∣fence; but when I declared no Names
should be inserted, I had a numerous Contribution, from all the Nobility,
Cler∣gy, and Gentry; amongst whom, when I name our excellent <HI>Lord
Chancellor,</HI> in whom Titles and Honours had made no Alteration, but that of
increasing his Politeness, Munificence, and Liberali∣ty, to every
Individual; our Patriot <HI>Speaker</HI>; and worthy Recorder <HI>Eaton
Stannard</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> I believe no Person of Distinction, will
blush to have their Names mentioned.</P>
<P>Well, at length my first Volume was finished, and I wrote a
bantering Letter to Sir <HI>J—n F—ke,</HI> to whom I have the
Dishonour to be allied, to tell him, that I intended to dedicate it to him, 
<PB N="213" REF="236"/> <HI>Nemine Con.</HI> He, whose Mind is truly pictured
in his ill-favoured Face, told my Son, that for himself, every Body would
take it as a thing done to make him ridi∣culous, since he had not any
Accomplish∣ments, that might merit an Encomium, which indeed was true, except
'tis his matchless Impudence, in keeping Pos∣session of an Estate,
which his own Mo∣ther, the Lady —, told him he had no more Right to, than
to the Dukedom of <HI>Burgundy.</HI></P>
<P>When his supposed Father, Sir <HI>B—ph F—ke</HI>
died, this young Spark was an Ensign in the Army, and stepping at once into
Affluence, he being naturally of a covetous Disposition, refused to pay
his Mother the Jointure which she claim'd, and was going to commence a Suit
with her; when one Morning she called on him and said, Hark ye, Sir
<HI>John,</HI> do you re∣solve to go to Law with me for what's my Right? He
begg'd to be excused, but told her, Self-Preservation was the first Law
of Nature; so it is Sir, said she, call∣ing him by his real Father's
Name; then <PB N="214" REF="237"/> you are no longer Sir <HI>J—n
F—ke</HI> which I will go instantly and make pub∣lick.</P>
<P>He fell dutifully on his Knees, entreat∣ed her Pardon for his
Disobedience, and promis'd for the future to pay all proper Resignation to
her superior Understand∣ing.—This, Sir <HI>John,</HI> you and many
others know to be Fact.</P>
<P>He pointed out to me, as a subject for everlasting Praise,
my beloved Lord <HI>Kingsborough,</HI> then Sir <HI>Robert King,</HI> and
though I had not the Felicity I have since experienced of a personal
Acquain∣tance with him, yet the Character pleased me, and accordingly I wrote
a trifling Dedication, far inferior to his Merit, which notwithstanding he
kindly accepted, and sent me the following Letter: 
<LETTER>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Return you my Thanks for the Fa∣vour of your Dedication,
which tho' I am sensible is too high a Compliment, yet my Vanity will not
permit me to refuse. I beg you will take the Trouble <PB N="215" REF="238"/>
to send your Servant to me to-morrow Morning, and you'll oblige,</P>
<CLOSER>
<SALUTE>Madam,</SALUTE> 
<SIGNED>Your devoted humble Servant, R. KING.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER></P>
<P>I accordingly sent my Son, who re∣turned with a Letter, in which
were in∣closed two Notes for ten Pounds each, The Letter was only this; 
<LETTER>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Once more return you Thanks for the Favour you intend me,
and have the Honour to be,</P>
<CLOSER>
<SALUTE>Madam,</SALUTE> 
<SIGNED>Your obliged humble Servant, R. KING.</SIGNED>
<DATELINE>York-street, 
<DATE>Tuesday Morning.</DATE></DATELINE></CLOSER>
</LETTER></P>
<P>An obliging and easy manner of con∣ferring the highest
Favours, is what few ev'n amongst the most Polite have been able to arrive
at, a Perfection which alone is given to adorn a <HI>Marlborough</HI> or a
<HI>Kingsborough.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="216" REF="239"/>But alas, how vain, how fleeting were all
the Joys I ever proposed to myself. This Nobleman, in whose Esteem I
ima∣gined myself to be so deeply riveted, that not Fortune, Time, or Fate,
could ever displace me, was, as I have since learn∣ed, by the
Insinuations of one <HI>Clancy,</HI> an old blind Beggar, whose Wants I had
often supplied, both in <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Dublin,</HI> persuaded to
believe, that I had spoken disrespectfully of his Lordship; and that my
Son said he would print his Letters, and sell them for Halspence a-piece;
all which was most notoriously false: However, it had such an Effect,
that his Lordship came to me, and giving me ten Guineas in a sort of
com∣manding Tone, desired me to give him his Letters; I burst into Tears,
and told him, I would resign them, (or even any thing, if possibly
dearer) to his Pleasure. I went to my Drawer, took as many as I could find,
and delivered them as I would, 
<Q> 
<L>The ruddy Drops that visit my sad Heart.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="240"/>He took them abruptly, and depart∣ing, told
me he would send in the Morning for the Remainder of them; he left me in a
Condition which I am utterly incapable of describing. A Cir∣cumstance so
unlook'd for, sunk me into a Train of the most gloomy Reflections, which
might have been attended with fatal Consequences, had not the Entrance of
some agreeable Company dissipated my present Reflections.</P>
<P>The next Morning before I was up a Chairman came and knock'd at
the the Door; the Servant asked who he wanted: He said he came from Lord
<HI>Kingsborough,</HI> and must see Mrs. <HI>Pil∣kington</HI> herself; he
told him I was not up; but he swore and stormed, saying he would not
leave the Place till he had his Lord's Letters from me. I happened to overhear
him, and desired the Maid to tell the Chairman, I would send to his
Lordship presently; I accord∣ing arose, and piqued at the Usage I had
received from the Fellow, I must confess with Shame, I wrote a little 
<PB N="218" REF="241"/> warmly on the Subject to my Lord, and without allowing
myself time for Thought dispatched it off. 
<Q> 
<L>For I bear Anger as the Flint bears Fire,</L> 
<L>Which much enforced, shews a hasty Spark,</L> 
<L>And strait is cool again.</L> 
<BIBL>SHAKESPEAR.</BIBL></Q> The fatal Epistle had scarce
left my Hand, e'er my Heart was agitated with the most sensible
Remorse. I in vain dispatched a Messenger after the first, 
<Q> 
<L>'Twas past, 'twas gone, 'twas irreco∣verable;</L></Q> It
reach'd his Hands, and he only sent for Answer, "'Tis very well:"</P>
<P>I believe the judicious Part of my Readers, must have
apprehended that the Sin of Ingratitude is not amongst the Number of mine,
since I have endeavour∣ed through my Work, if possible, to make the
contrary conspicuous, by ren∣dering <PB N="219" REF="242"/> due Praise to
all my Benefactors. Yet what could my beloved Lord ima∣gine, but that he had
bestow'd all his Fa∣vours on an unworthy Person?</P>
<P>I did not believe that after all the An∣guish of Mind I had
sustained through my Life, any thing could move my Phi∣losophy, (which
had made me determine never to be overjoyed or surprized, at any Advancement
in Life, nor deject∣ed or cast down at any Adversity on this Side Futurity)
so much as this.</P>
<P>Downy Repose was a Stranger to my Pillow, and I fell a Prey to
the greatest Languor and Heaviness of Soul. How∣ever as I knew his
Lordship was filled with the Milk of human Pity, I ima∣gined, by apologizing
for the rash Act, I should be blest with his forgiveness, and a Renewal
of his Friendship to me, to which End I wrote the following Lines: 
<Q> 
<LG>
<HEAD>To the Right Hon. the Lord
<HI>Kings∣borough.</HI></HEAD>
<L>No more my Lord with Pleasure I expect,</L>
<L>Your friendly Aid my Weakness to protect.</L>
<L><PB N="220" REF="243"/>Lost to those Transports, you
have oft inspired,</L>
<L>And every Happiness my Soul desir'd;</L>
<L>Oh where for Succour, whither shall I fly,</L>
<L>But buried in unheard of Sorrows die?</L>
<L>The Soul of Pity dwells not in a Slave,</L>
<L>But kind Compassion dignifies the brave.</L>
<L>At <HI>Darius</HI>' Woes, great <HI>Philip</HI>'s Warlike
Son</L>
<L>Was mov'd, when Conquests and when Toils were done.</L>
<L>Each Godlike Hero has a tender Part,</L>
<L>And Woes like mine, wou'd melt a sa∣vage Heart.</L>
<L>E'er long my Soul had no Desire in View,</L>
<L>No Hope or Wish, but that of pleasing you.</L>
<L>One Smile from you could make a rich Amends,</L>
<L>For shatter'd Fortune, and the Loss of Friends:</L>
<L>Esteem'd by you, I could with Ease survey</L>
<L>My Name and Honour, to the World a Prey.</L>
<L><PB N="221" REF="244"/>But now no more, I'm ravish'd with
that Voice,</L>
<L>Whose sacred Sound bids Agony rejoice,</L>
<L>The vernal Blooms no longer give me Ease,</L>
<L>Nor painted Violets my Fancy please.</L>
<L>Each Darling Object but elates my Grief,</L>
<L>And Death's cold Hand can only give Relief.</L>
<L>Yet, when <HI>Laetitia</HI> shall exist no more,</L>
<L>But Dust to Dust, as she must short,
re∣store,</L>
<L>Shed one kind Tear of Pity on her Hearse,</L>

<L>And let no Stone or Marble ever tell</L>
<L>What Woes her Children, or herself, be∣fel:</L>
<L>But, mix'd and cover'd, with forgotten Clay,</L>
<L>Time shall dissolve her Memory away.</L>

<P>His Lordship sent me the following Answer, which only added
more Weight to my oppressed Soul.

<SALUTE>Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Am extremely honoured, by that Esteem and Friendship

<P>I concluded from this Letter, that I had lost all the Share in
his Esteem, that I once flattered myself I was possessed of; which
shews the Instability of human Af∣fairs.</P>
<P>And here, gentle Reader, my Story and my Life draw to a Period. I
am con∣vinced, from the present Situation of my Health, that I shall never
live to see this Volume published. It is the only Legacy I have to leave my
poor Boy, who, I fear, <PB N="223" REF="246"/> will meet with many Enemies, on
ac∣count of my Writings, when it will be out of my Power to protect him. But
Oh! ye Good and Great, to you and the Almighty I commend him; and hope that
Tenderness which melted you to com∣passionate my Woes, will incline you
to assist him. Believe me, my dear Lord <HI>Kingsborough,</HI> no
Creature living holds your Lordship in higher Esteem than he; and, as you
told me in one of your Letters, your Inclinations were, and En∣deavours
should be, to serve him, let not the Memory of my Offence prevent your
keeping that Promise sacred.</P>

<HEAD>APPENDIX.</HEAD>
<P>I Promised in my Proposals for print∣ing this Volume by
Subscription, to give the Readers a Key to the first, second, and third
Volumes, in this Place; but having been advised by some judici∣ous Friends,
that such a thing would only tend to create ill Blood, and excite a
Re∣sentment too powerful to be withstood by so inconsiderable a
Person as myself, it has been thought expedient to furnish them with an
Account of my Mother's Death; which I am the more capable of doing, as I
remained with her to her last Moments.</P>
<P>She had been a long time in a declin∣ing State of Health, having
an extreme bad Stomach, and Digestion: Nor did <PB N="225" REF="248"/> she
imagine that Nature could have held out as long as it did.</P>
<P>She never seemed in the least uneasy at the Knowledge of her
approaching End; often declaring, that if she could take me with her to
Felicity, she would leave this World without Reluctance.</P>
<P>And indeed, I am not surprized, that her maternal Love extended
so far, as she even then foresaw the Calamities which I have since
sustained; and knew, that if the World, at her first setting out as a
Writer, with her extraordinary Ta∣lents, scarce afforded her Bread, my Fate
must be even harder, except I met the Patronage of some illustrious
Per∣son.</P>
<P>And Providence seemed inclinable to comply with her Wish; for,
in the lat∣ter End of <HI>June,</HI> 1751, I was seized with a most violent
Pleuretic Fever, which I got by an extreme Cold, I sent for Doctor
<HI>Fergus,</HI> a most eminent Physician, and worthy Gentleman; my Mother
was at this time so weak as to be obliged to keep her Bed: When the Doctor
saw me, and <PB N="226" REF="249"/> heard the Symptoms of my Disorder, he
told me I was a dead Man; that I should have applied some Days sooner,
since he was now of Opinion it had got too far the Ascendency over me for
any Cure to be effected: However, he ordered me to be blooded four times that
Day, and then went up to my Mother's Apartment.</P>
<P>She asked him his Advice upon her own Case and mine; and he
told her a little too frankly, that Nature might do something for my
Recovery, but that her Death was inevitable; she smiling, said to him,
That the Worms would have but a poor Feast of her, she being quite worn
away.</P>
<P>Well, I was blooded according to his Order, and the Fever abated
considerably. I had the next Night an excessive Perspi∣ration, which
carried off all the Symp∣toms except a little Weakness.</P>
<P>In the Morning a young Lady, who honour'd me with a particular
Regard, came to see me. She was so excessively delighted at my speedy
and unexpected Recovery, that she resolved to spend the 
<PB N="227" REF="250"/> Day with me; and my poor Mother, ever willing to
contribute to my Satisfac∣tion, told the Nurse-keeper that she found
herself much better, and desired she might be brought to my Apartment;
accord∣ingly she lifted my dear Mother like a Child, in her Arms, and placed
her in an Elbow-chair by my Bed-side: She affect∣ed, in order to please me,
to be extremely chearful; and the young Lady kneeled down, and asked her
Blessing; telling her she wanted to have a Wedding in the House
instead of a Burying from it. My Mother, who retained her Spirits and good
Humour to the last, gave us both her Blessing very devoutly, and her
sin∣cere Permission to marry. I had a small Chicken dressed for my
Dinner, of which my Mother partook, but her Stomach was too weak to keep it, or
a Glass of Wine, which she drank after it; so she was obliged to be
carried to Bed.</P>
<P>After her Departure, as the Weather was vastly warm, I ordered
the Maid to open the Sash-window; and, in the mean time, comes the Doctor; we
were just <PB N="228" REF="251"/> going to drink Tea: This Gentleman is a
little near-sighted; but seeing the Sash up, and Company in the Room,
What, said he, this poor Boy's gone; I thought so! And was going out: No,
Sir, said I, I am still alive: Alive! said he, And what are all these
People doing here? He immediately went and darkened the Win∣dow, taking the
Company by the Shoul∣ders, and turning them out; he then charged the
Nurse-keeper, not to open the Window, nor let any Person talk to me for a
Week.</P>
<P>I thought this Prescription a little hard, as I imagined
myself quite well: Accordingly the next Morning I sent the Nurse out, got
up, dressed my∣self, and went to my poor Mother; she was agreeably
surprized to see me, but upon opening the Curtains, I found she had a
great Cast in her Eyes, which shocked me extremely, and she told me, that
every thing appeared double to her; I did not give her to understand, that I
perceived it, but told her, she looked better than I had known her do a long 
<PB N="229" REF="252"/> Time. She said the Doctor had given her over: Why so
he did me, Madam, and yet you see I am alive; and if you will take my
Prescription, I dare say you will make a Fibber of him.</P>
<P>She said she would, and I proposed, that my Spouse as I
call'd Miss <HI>C—m,</HI> and she, and I, should the next Morning
go to <HI>Chapel Izod,</HI> a Place about three Miles from Dublin, and spend
the Day. She seemed quite pleased with my Re∣quest, and sent to have a
Landau bespoke for that Purpose.</P>
<P>In the Morning she was up and dressed before me, and was as
sprightly as I had ever seen her, tho' quite weak, inso∣much that she
was obliged to be carried into the Machine and out again.</P>
<P>We set out before Breakfast, and went thro' the
<HI>Phoenix</HI> Park, it was a fine Day, and we had the Landau opened; the
fresh Air vastly revived her, and she repeated a good many Lines of the
Poem on <HI>Windsor-Forest</HI>; she even complained of being hungry.
When we came to the Tavern, I ordered some Tea; and to <PB N="230" REF="253"/>
my infinite Surprize, my Mother called for a Plate of Ham, and some Oil and
Vinegar, eat very hearty, and drank two Glasses of White-wine.</P>
<P>The Readers may judge that I was overjoyed at seeing so fair a
Prospect of her Recovery; she after made a Shift to walk down into the
Flower-Garden, and seemed to enjoy the balmy Fragrance with great inward
Satisfaction. I then went in, and bespoke Dinner, which was young Ducks, and
Green Pease; my Mother lay down and slept 'till 'twas ready, at which Hour
she rose, and eat very hearty: There happened to be a Couple of Gentlemen
in the House of our Ac∣quaintance, who after Dinner joined Com∣pany with us;
and my Mother told them that the Doctor had given her over, but she-was
resolved to outlive the whole Faculty. In short, she related twenty
agreeable Stories to our infinite En∣tertainment.</P>
<P>Little did I imagine, that our present Joy was only the Prologue
to the Grief I too soon after received. We did not leave <HI>Chapel Izod</HI>
till Ten at Night, <PB N="231" REF="254"/> when we all set out in the Landau;
I know not whether the Air might not have been very fatal to her, for no
sooner were we got a hundred Yards, but she began to cough, and continued
so all that Night, during which I sat up with her.</P>
<P>We lodged at this Time in the House of one <HI>Sheil,</HI> in
<HI>Phraper-Lane, Dublin:</HI> We had a first and second Floor, for which
we constantly paid Ten Shillings and Six-pence a Week; the Man of the House
had been a Parish-Clerk, and had held that Dignity under my Father for some
Years; he afterwards turned Farrier, or Horse-Doctor, in which meeting with
no Success, he came to <HI>Dublin,</HI> took a House which he let to
Lodgers, except the Parlours and Kit∣chen, and commenced a famous Quack; I
question whither the most eminent of that Profession in
<HI>London,</HI> which I take to be <HI>R—k,</HI> ever tried more
salutary Methods to destroy the human Species, than this profound
<HI>Esculapius</HI> had done, nor with more Success; whom we shall 
<PB N="232" REF="255"/> hereafter distinguish by the Title of Doctor
<HI>Sheil.</HI></P>
<P>This Wretch, who was ignorant be∣yond Conception, was a Compound
of Pragmatacism and Hypocrisy, his Eyes were eternally bent to Heaven, with
the most solemn and austere Aspect, while his Heart was perpetrating
the Destruc∣tion of all who had the Misfortune to be thrown into his
House.</P>
<P>The first Instance which convinced me of it, was this; the
light Guineas were now cried down, so that People would scarcely accept
them on any Account. This Doctor was very particular every <HI>Saturday</HI> to
call for his Money; being the most avaricious Mortal I had seen. It
happened one Evening, that we had no Money in the House but these Gui∣neas,
one of which was very remarkable and wanted Six Shillings. This I gave him, and
allowed him the Deficiency. In a few Days after, every light Guinea which my
Mother had, she sold, and took current Guineas for them. She had exactly
five Weight ones in her Purse. <PB N="233" REF="256"/> One Morning that I went
out, she left her Pocket hanging on a Chair; as she was never
suspicious of any one. When I returned, she was going to send me to pay
some Cash; when what should I see but the light Guinea I had some
Days before given <HI>Sheil.</HI> The Thing astonished me; I asked if
<HI>Sheil</HI> had been in the Room, she said no, nor any Person
be∣sides Nurse; this Nurse, under the Rose, was much addicted to
Liquor, I called her, and examined her closely about the Matter, she
strenuously denied her know∣ing any thing of it; at length, by Threats and
Entreaties, she confessed that <HI>Sheil</HI> had given her Half a Pint
of Rum to change them in her Pocket, he assuring her it was the same
Thing.</P>
<P>I now besought my Mother's Permis∣sion to lay the old
canting R—l in Newgate, but she begged, that I would let her die in
Peace, and not cause her last Moments to be disturbed with Contention;
she farther conjured me not to mention it till she was either dead, or in
some <PB N="234" REF="257"/> other Lodging. In Compliance to her Request, I
dropt the Affair.</P>
<P>But notwithstanding her Desire of Quietness, this
Blood-hound, for such alone I can stile him, resolved to hasten her
Exit; for the next Day watching his Opportunity, when I was out, he came up,
and with an austere Countenance demanded three Weeks Rent, which was that Day
due to him, she told him in a faint Voice, that I was gone for Money, and
would pay him at my Return; but he swore he would not be trifled with any
longer; and if she did not instantly pay him, he would turn her into the
Street.</P>
<P>Imagine what a Shock this Behaviour must be to one in her feeble
Condition; she could make no Answer, but burst into Tears. Come, Madam,
said the inhuman Cannibal, these Arts won't pass on me; give me either my
Money, or Value for it, or by G—d you shall go out of this Lodging.</P>
<P>She gave him the Keys of her Draw∣ers, and desired him to take
any Move∣ables <PB N="235" REF="258"/> he thought proper for his Security, and
intreated for Christian Charity he would leave the Room, as his Presence
was baneful to her.</P>
<P>This was all he aimed at, so ve∣ry modestly helped himself
to every Thing that was valuable, and left the Room.</P>
<P>I returned soon after, and was greatly surprized, to see my
poor Mother trembling, and pale, so that she scarce seemed to live;
she faintly looked up at me, and said my dear Child, that Villain
<HI>Sheil</HI> has been the Death of your Mother; I knew I had not long to
exist, but sure it was cruel to stab at Half an Hour of my frail
Life.</P>
<P>I could scarce contain the various Pas∣sions rising in my
Breast; Love, Pity, Horror, and Resentment, reciprocally took Place, and I
should doubtless have gone and taken his Life, but that filial Duty
withheld me from adding to my dear Mother's Affliction.</P>
<P><PB N="236" REF="259"/>I prevailed on her to take a little mull'd
Wine, after which she went to Bed; and I found on the Table these Lines,
which were the last she ever wrote; 
<Q> 
<L>My Lord, my Saviour, and my God,</L> 
<L>I bow to thy correcting Rod;</L> 
<L>Nor will I murmur or complain,</L> 
<L>Tho' ev'ry Limb be fill'd with Pain;</L> 
<L>Tho' my weak Tongue its Aid denies,</L> 
<L>And Day-light wounds my wretched Eyes.</L></Q></P>
<P>I sat up with her all this Night, during which she slept
little for the heavy Cough on her Lungs; but she retained her Senses so
well, that she entertained me with many Stories, and repeated Part of a Poem
written on Mrs. <HI>Waller.</HI> I believe, Ma∣dam, said I, she's a
Subscriber to you; Yes, said she, she paid the Money to my Father. I
now found her Brain begin to grow defective; which gave the most piercing
Anguish to my Heart I had ever received.</P>
<P>She doz'd a little about four o'Clock in the Morning; and when
she awoke, <PB N="237" REF="260"/> told me, she had a mighty agreeable
Dream; which was, that her Father came to her in a Mourning Coach and Six; and
told her he was very angry she had been so long ill, and yet never sent
for him whom she knew was always ready to assist her: I am come,
continued he, to bring you out of all your Troubles; and with that, took her in
his Arms, like a Child, and carried her away in the Coach.</P>
<P>My boding Heart readily interpreted this Dream, as indeed did her
own; my Dear, said she, you know the Usage I have received from your
Father, together with the Knowledge I have that there are but few good
Clergymen to be found, have ever made me declare that I would permit none of
them to visit me in my last Hours, except dear Doctor <HI>Delany:</HI>
However, since he is from Town, and the World would add Impiety to all they
have said of me, if I don't have some one of them, pray send for the
Cu∣rate of this Parish; I accordingly did, and we all joined in Prayer; after
which she fell into a good deal of Discourse with <PB N="238" REF="261"/>
him, and they drank a Glass of Wine to∣gether: He asked her if she
forgave my Father; and she related the following Story to him.</P>
<P>There was an honest <HI>Irish</HI> Papist, on his Death-bed,
and when the Priest was going to give him Absolution, he asked the sick
Man, If he freely forgave all his Enemies? Otherwise he could not
admi∣nister that Sacrament to him; the Man replied, Arah faith, Father, I do
forgive every one, only <HI>Teddy Brenan,</HI> that poun∣ded my Cow. Nay, but,
said the Priest, you must forgive him also, or I cannot absolve you;
Well, said he, Father, if I die, I will forgive him; but if I live, I never
can. Will that do, said the sick Man? Arah faith, said the Priest, if
it won't do, it must do; and accordingly proceeded.</P>
<P>So, Sir, said she, if I die I do forgive him; and I wish the
God whom he has offended may do the same; but if I live, mark you that,
Master Parson, I never will.</P>
<P><PB N="239" REF="262"/>The Clergyman departed, and in about an
Hour's time came a great long Letter, written, I suppose, at the Desire
of Doctor <HI>Sheil,</HI> by some of the enthusiastical Me∣thodists, of
which <HI>Dublin</HI> is now the chief Receptacle in his Majesty's
Domi∣nions; it was written in their whining Stile, declaring that she, my
Mother, was damned beyond Redemption; that she was now on the Brink of Hell;
and that not the Blood of the Lamb could inter∣cept her.</P>
<P>We both laughed at this fantastic Con∣trivance, and she only
wished for Strength to be able to answer it properly; but alas, that she
never had.</P>
<P>This Day she retained her Senses to∣lerably till Evening, when
she began to talk incoherently. I sat up till Four in the Morning, at which
time I grew very heavy: What, said she, can't you watch and pray a Moment,
till this bitter Cup passes from me; a Moment, and I shall be no more:
Come, said she, kneel down, and take my Blessing, and the last Adieu.
With a Heart rent in twain, I complied, <PB N="240" REF="263"/> and she laid
her Hand on my Head, and said, very devoutly, the God of <HI>Abra∣ham,
Isaac,</HI> and <HI>Jacob,</HI> bless you; the Father, the Son, and Holy
Ghost, pro∣tect and guard you, and bring you safe to everlasting Peace,
where I go a little before you; for, surely, my dear Child, I believe,
through Christ, I shall be happy hereafter.</P>
<P>The Words made so deep an Impres∣sion on my Soul, that I
could not help repeating them; and I do it more par∣ticularly, because some
People have been cruel enough to say, she died an Atheist; but surely
ev'ry Person, who examines her Writings, will find that she was a
sin∣cere Believer in the Doctrines of Christ∣ianity, as taught by the
Church of <HI>Eng∣land</HI>; the perpetual Benefit of which I hope she now
enjoys. I remember in the Beginning of her Illness, she called me to her;
and said, I have a thing to request, and you must by no means deny me,
but promise on your Life, your Honour, and your Soul, to perform it; I told
her, as I had not often disobeyed her, she need <PB N="241" REF="264"/> not
be so particular in charging me; 'tis this, said she, in a few Days
you'll lose your poor little Mother; and as you know I have no Money, your
Father un∣doubtedly will bury me, and, perhaps, may propose putting my
Remains in his Family Burial Place; but if you suffer that, you have my heavy
Curse; nay, if it's possible, I will come from the Grave to resent it.
Lay me by my dear Father, and let our kindred Ashes mingle toge∣ther; for,
were I put in the Ground with your Father,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">She and her
Father are buried in <HI>St. Anne's</HI> Church,
<HI>Dawson-street,</HI></NOTE> 
<Q> 
<L>The Miracle of <HI>Thebes</HI> wou'd be re∣new'd,</L> 
<L>And the dividing Flames burn diffe∣rent Ways.</L></Q> These
were her very Words: Now, said she, if ever you grow rich, erect a little
square Marble Stone over me; and let this Inscription be on it; 
<Q><HI>Here lyeth, near the Body of her ho∣noured Father,</HI> John
Vanlewen, <HI>M. D. the Mortal Part of</HI><LB/><HI>Mrs.</HI> LAETITIA
PILKINGTON,<LB/><PB N="242" REF="265"/> <HI>Whose Spirit hopes for that Peace,
thro' the infinite Merit of</HI> CHRIST, <HI>which a cruel and merciless
World never afforded her.</HI></Q></P>
<P>I sincerely promised to obey her In∣junction. But to
return:—Between Five and Six her Breath grew short, and her Eye-Sight
failed her, I went, and em∣bracing her Hand, which was now almost lifeless,
asked her if she knew me: Yes, said she, you are my eldest Son, come
from the College for my Blessing; you might have called before, but God
bless you. It seemed as if her not being per∣mitted to see him
disturbed her last Mo∣ments. She then desired me to kneel down and pray
by her, which I did, still keeping her Hand in mine, I found it grow cold,
and heavy, and looking up just saw her expire with a Sigh.</P>
<P>I now beheld the most tender and en∣dearing Mother departed from
me: My only Prop and Succour gone: While I saw myself ready to be exposed
to all the Malice of Fortune. I too well before ex∣perienced the obdurate
Temper of my <PB N="243" REF="266"/> Father, to hope any Favour from him.
However, summoning up all my Phi∣losophy, and reposing my intire
Confi∣dence in divine Providence, I left that Scene of Sorrow and Lamentation,
and retired to take a little Repose.</P>
<P>I had some few Days before this se∣cured all my Mother's
Manuscripts in the Hands of a Friend, which was very fortunate for me,
since the Moment old <HI>Sheil</HI> heard she was dead, he ran into the
Dining-Room, and secured every Thing he could lay Hands on; after which he
went to inform my Father of the long wished and joyful News. He could
scarce credit it at first; but when the pious Mr. <HI>Sheil</HI>
assured him on the Word of a Christian, that he spoke Truth, my Father,
with great Composure, said it had been well for her, to have died some
Years ago; old <HI>Sheil</HI> assured him, that he believed she would not
have died this Bout, but for the Fright he gave her in her Sickness; for
which kind Office my Father could not but thank him.</P>
<P><PB N="244" REF="267"/>He gave immediate Orders for her Funeral,
which you may depend on it was not profuse; he allowed her, how∣ever a decent
Oak Coffin and Shrowd, and the Nurse-keeper told me, that <HI>Sheil</HI> was
so unparalleled a Wretch, that she could scarce keep him out of the Room
while she stripped the Corpse, which the Moment she had done, and put
her Shrowd on, he came and took the Linen in which she died, and secured
that also.</P>
<P>When I arose in the Morning, the old Hypocrite asked me to
Breakfast with him, and endeavoured to comfort me, by saying my Father was
too good a Christian to let me want; and that as the Cause of his Anger to
me was now removed, by the Death of my Mother, the Effect would undoubtedly
cease.</P>
<P>I told him I expected nothing from him, nor should I, tho'
infinitely di∣stressed, make any Application to him; that Nature
instructed me to love and protect my Mother, whose Cause my Duty prompted
me to espouse, of which <PB N="245" REF="268"/> I could not be ashamed,
since I would do it, were it to be done again.</P>
<P>He said I ought to submit to my Fa∣ther, and write to him;
and, said he, those Papers and Letters you have, send them to him, which
will prove your Respect, and I will engage to me∣diate Matters so well
between you, that he shall allow you Twenty Pounds a Year, tho' he won't
see you.</P>
<P>As I am too apt to be credulous, had any Person, but this Man,
whom my Soul abhorred, made such Overtures, I should have thought there was
something in it; but if the Harmony of Angels proceeded from his Lips, whom I
looked on as the Murderer of my dear Mother, it would to me be hateful as the
Hissing of Serpents.</P>
<P>However, I listened to him, and an∣swered that those Papers
would certainly obtain Money for me, and Promises were often broke; that as
to Twenty Pounds a Year, my Father would as soon give Twenty of his Teeth;
but if the officious Mr. <HI>Sheil</HI> would prevail <PB N="246" REF="269"/> on
my Father to give me Fifty Pounds, I would not only resign them, but would go
to some Part of the World, where he should never hear of me.</P>
<P>The latter Part of this my Father would readily agree to, nay have
given me his Blessing at my Departure, <HI>but not a Word of the Nine and
Forty Pieces.</HI> Indeed another <HI>pious Divine</HI> offered me a Sum of
Money to go to <HI>America,</HI> which because I did not consent to, he has
since utterly rejected me; but a little Time will shew the World his
Motives for that, and open a very <HI>unexpected Scene to the Publick</HI>; and
tho' I have not kept my Promise to him in making the Affair known before now,
yet I take this Op∣portunity of informing his Reverence that I have not forgot
him.</P>
<P>In short, the Doctor (<HI>Sheil</HI> I mean) went to my Father,
and told my Con∣ditions; but he only laughed, and said I had not my Mother's
Genius, and must quickly fall into Contempt, there∣fore he very fairly set
me at Defiance; and should I dare to print any Thing <PB N="247" REF="270"/>
against him, he had Interest enough to send me over the Water. I am
sorry for the disagreeable Necessity I am under of speaking or
writing any Thing to displease him, but Facts may be related, I hope,
without Offence.</P>
<P>The next Day Mr. <HI>Faulkner</HI> inserted the following
Paragraph in his Paper.</P>
<P><HI>Yesterday Morning died Mrs.</HI> Letitia Pilkington. And the
Author of <HI>Pue's Oc∣currences,</HI> one of the worst Papers pub∣lished
there, (I suppose by my Father's Direction) inserted a very false and
scan∣dalous Paragraph; while Mr. <HI>Esdall,</HI> who is a Gentleman of
known Worth and In∣tegrity published a genteel Encomium on her.</P>
<P>A few Days after I wrote the following little Piece, which, as it
was almost my first Attempt in Rhyme, and on so par∣ticular a Subject, I
hope the Readers will pardon me for introducing it here. 
<Q> <PB N="248" REF="271"/> 
<LG>
<HEAD>On the <HI>DEATH</HI> of my <HI>BELOVED
MOTHER.</HI></HEAD>
<L>And shall no mournful elegiac Lay,</L>
<L>Thy matchless Worth and Excellence dis∣play?</L>
<L>From me, at least, 'tis but a poor Amends,</L>
<L>Thou tenderest Mother, and thou best of Friends;</L>
<L>While, from my Eyes, the streaming Sorrows run,</L>
<L>Accept this Tribute from thy darling Son;</L>
<L>Who, taught by thee, in melting Num∣bers tells</L>
<L>What agonizing Pain his Bosom swells;</L>
<L>What dreadful Anguish preys upon his Mind,</L>
<L>That thou art fled, and he remains be∣hind:</L>
<L>Pleas'd if with you he might ascend the Sky,</L>
<L>To the bright Regions of Felicity;</L>
<L>But here no Joy, no Comfort, no De∣light,</L>
<L>Can charm his Fancy, or divert his Sight:</L>
<L><PB N="249" REF="272"/>Wilt thou from never-fading Bliss
de∣scend</L>
<L>Me from the Storms of Fortune to de∣fend?</L>
<L>Midst the rude Strokes of adverse Fate protect,</L>
<L>Or in sweet Visions all my Ways direct:</L>
<L>Alas! too many Blessings wait on thee,</L>
<L>To know one anxious, tender Pang for me.</L>
<L>Yet sure the pure celestial Joys above,</L>
<L>Cannot extirpate thy maternal Love;</L>
<L>Which, with a Care, Description that sur∣past,</L>
<L>Defended me from each untimely Blast;</L>
<L>Rais'd me to Knowledge in each polish'd Art,</L>
<L>Refin'd my Manners, and improv'd my Heart;</L>
<L>Taught me from pleasing, sacred Truths to know,</L>
<L>The Source from whence perpetual Mer∣cies flow:</L>
<L>Then, to the Throne of never-dying Worth,</L>
<L><PB N="250" REF="273"/>Taught me to pour my Supplications
forth.</L>
<L>May that transcendant Pow'r, which call'd you hence,</L>
<L>Be still my Shield, my Refuge, and De∣fence,</L>
<L>Till the grim Tyrant kindly ends my Pain,</L>
<L>And we, enraptur'd, meet in Heav'n again.</L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>I never communicated these Lines to any one; and now
transcribe them only from my Memory.</P>
<P>Since, by writing this little Account, I have obtained the Honour
of speaking to the Public, it gives me an Opportu∣nity of saying
something in Favour of my∣self, who I am convinced have been
mis∣represented to them, and for which, I hope, I shall be excused, as
Self-preser∣vation is the first Law of Nature. There are many Persons of
some Note in Life, who have, on hearing me mentioned, cried, Oh, horrid Dog,
shocking Fellow, &amp;c. Pray, Gentlemen and Ladies, for 
<PB N="251" REF="274"/> what? Where are my Accusers; let them name the
particular Crimes for which I deserve those Epithets, or else not
men∣tion me at all.</P>
<P>My Lord <HI>Stafford,</HI> I think, is the only Instance which
<HI>English</HI> History furnishes us with, of a Person being condemn'd
for accumulated Treason; nay, even he had a fair Hearing for his Life: But
these People are for condemning me unheard, for no particular Fault, only
that such and such People say so and so.</P>
<P>A Consciousness of this has made me resolve to write my
own Life, by which means only I shall have a Power of setting Things in a
clear Light, and of adjusting many present Ambiguities; and, though I
confess the Public are bur∣thened with Things of this kind already, many of
which have no Tendency to re∣form the Manners of the Age, but rather vitiate
them; yet I flatter myself, among the Variety of real Incidents, and
whimsical Revolutions I have met with, they may find as well Entertainment,
as Matter, to moralize on.</P>
<P><PB N="252" REF="275"/>As I do by no means assume the Name of a
Writer, so the Public may be as∣sured I shall never attempt Satyr; if
my Betters have Faults, that's no Affair of mine; I am to pursue my own
Story. A Man who can't put up with a Tweak by the Nose, and a Foot in the
Rump, is not fit to live in this fashionable World; I therefore assure
the Public, before hand, that I will be quite passive; and tho' I name the
Error, not the Man; by which man∣ner of Proceeding, 'tis not improbable that by
the time I am fourscore, I may have an Annuity of forty Pounds a Year; upon
the Hopes of which I may reaso∣nably subsist and keep up my Spirits.
And in this I strictly follow the Advice of a certain great Man in
<HI>Ireland,</HI> whose Place of Abode is not remote from the
<HI>Phenix-Park</HI>; and whose Acquirements have justly raised him from
Obscurity to Opulence; his extensive Plans in Build∣ing have excited an
universal Admiration of his Taste in Architecture. This worthy Person I
applied to, after the Death of my Mother; and informed him, that I 
<PB N="253" REF="276"/> was possessed of some Letters, which he had in
her Life-time been pleased to ho∣nour her with; and that as her Papers would,
undoubtedly, fall into the Hands of a Printer, I thought proper, lest the
Publication of them might be offensive to him, to give him this
Information.</P>
<P>He sent his Compliments by the Mes∣senger, and desired to
see me the next Morning; I accordingly waited on him; and tho' my
Circumstances were not in the flow, yet, in order to convince him that I had
no lucrative Motive in addres∣sing him, I put the Letters under a Cover,
and sent them in before me.</P>
<P>I was then introduced to his Presence; he received me with the
utmost good Manners, desiring me to sit: Young Man, said he, I have had
a Letter from you lately, concerning some Writings of mine to your Mother;
she was a Lady whom I regarded, on account of her Fa∣ther and Family, whom I
well knew; and therefore I corresponded with, and assisted her, my
Letters you have here sent me; and, young Man, I'll <PB N="254" REF="277"/>
keep them; and will give you a Piece of Advice better than Gold, if you'll
follow it.</P>
<P>There has been lately at my House his G—ce the P—te
*****, and several other Persons of the most eminent Stations in this
Kingdom, and discour∣sing of your Mother's Writings, intro∣duced you; and
it was said, that you had taken the Liberty to write to several great Men,
very much in the Stile of your Mother; they imagined, when she was dead, they
should have heard no more of the Matter; but you seem'd to keep her Spirit
alive. Now, young Man, said he, consider you are not a Woman, from whom
ev'n a Blow cannot hurt Ho∣nour: We tollerated those Things in her, which, in
you, would be culpable in the highest degree; in short, if you have any
Talents, as I am told you have, apply them to make Friends, instead of
troubling your Head about the Follies of Mankind; find out their Virtues, and
make that your Theme. Indeed, Sir, that, said I, will be a difficult Matter. 
<PB N="255" REF="278"/> In short, Sir, continued he, if you do not apply your
Genius, according to the Will of your Superiors, Care will be taken to send
you out of the Kingdom before you are aware of it.</P>
<P>I thanked him sincerely for his Admo∣nition, which I determined
from that Mo∣ment to establish as my Principle; and, on my Return thro' the
Park, upon ex∣amining the Affair, found it more ratio∣nal to suppose, that
I should live by writ∣ing Panygeric than Satyr, I resolved to try the
Experiment, and, at the same time, determined to bestow random Praise, no
matter to me tho' the Person I addressed was tainted with the most
diabolical Vices, I was to form the supposed Vir∣tues and Graces from my
own copious Idea. The first I exerted my Talent on, was the <HI>Son of a
Bashaw,</HI> then resident in these <HI>Dominions</HI>; and one whose
<HI>wise Interposition</HI> in the <HI>S—te</HI> Matters of that
<HI>Kingdom,</HI> have made him so much the Darling of the <HI>grateful</HI>
People, and so far raised Envy on this Side the Wa∣ter, that on his Return,
instead of Ac∣clamations <PB N="256" REF="279"/> he is accosted with Sneers
and Hisses, where-ever he appears; while he, conscious of his innate
Worth, sheds a contemptuous Smile on the sense∣less Idiots, who are
weak enough to cen∣sure his superior Abilities.</P>
<P>I remembered to have heard him re∣ceive the Applause of the
Senate-house, for telling Mr. S—r, that as the Sea∣son was far
advanced, and the Gentlemen desirous of returning to their Seats, he thought
it best to p—ge the P—t till <HI>April</HI> ensuing.</P>
<P>This sublime Piece of Elocution was Matter enough for me, who,
from my present System, you'll allow was a pro∣fess'd Sycophant; I
accordingly wrote some Lines on the Occasion, which were not of
Consequence enough to subsist till this time; therefore cannot be here
re∣cited. I waited on his L—p, and put them into his Hand as he stept
into his Chariot; he received them, and drove off; the next Morning I waited at
the same Place, till he was going out, and had the Honour of a gracious
Smile; <PB N="257" REF="280"/> upon which, I liv'd elegantly that Day. The
succeeding Morning I receiv'd, What? a familiar Nod! Upon which I
subsisted tollerably, till five that After∣noon. At that Time indeed,
some extra∣ordinary Emotion in my Stomach, gave me to understand, that Nods
and Smiles though conferr'd by the Sons of Bashaws, will not fill the
Belly.</P>
<P>The indifferent Success of my first En∣terprize made me
almost determine, never to attempt any Thing more in that Way; though an
Affair of like Nature, which happened some Time before, might, if I had
common Sense, have been sufficient to deter me.</P>
<P>As I was walking one Day, pensive and pennyless through
<HI>Henry-street,</HI> I saw some Footmen and Chairmen with White Gloves
and Cockades; and on en∣quiring the Occasion, was told that L—d
<HI>H—th,</HI> was that Day married to Miss <HI>K—g</HI>; I
immediately ran to a Coffee-House, call'd for Pen, Ink, and Paper, and wrote
a flaming Epithalamium, which I as suddenly dispatch'd, resolving to 
<PB N="258" REF="281"/> have the Start of all <HI>Grub-street.</HI> His
L—dship came out and told the Mes∣senger, that when Mr.
<HI>Pilkington</HI> wrote better Verses, he would send him a Re∣ward.</P>
<P>I was at this Time in a Window op∣posite to his Lordship, who
saw the Man come over and deliver me the Answer; I took a Pen, and before
his Face, wrote Extempore the following Truth: 
<Q> 
<LG>
<HEAD>To the Right Hon. the Lord <HI>H—th.</HI></HEAD>
<L>In a Coffee-House hurried, and prest by my Fate,</L>
<L>I wrote a few Lines to get something to eat;</L>
<L>Perhaps, though the Subject, a Dunce might inspire,</L>
<L>The want of Subsistence has slackened my Fire;</L>
<L>But if your kind Lordship, that Want will supply,</L>
<L>No Man shall write faster, nor better than I.</L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P><PB N="259" REF="282"/>His Lordship sent Word it was very well:
It may be so, thought I, but Faith I found it very ill.</P>
<P>I could not avoid repeating the Story, in some Companies I after
fell into, and whether they resented the Reception I met, or had some
former Pique to that N—n, I shall not pretend to say, but shortly
after, the following Epigram was handed about; 
<Q> 
<L>When in proper Terms, we Dulness would cloath,</L> 
<L>We say you'r as dull as the Hill that's in
<HI>H—th</HI>;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">'Tis frequent in <HI>Dublin,</HI>
to say you are as stu∣pid as the Hill of <HI>Hoath.</HI></NOTE></L> 
<L>But would you give Dulness the Force of Record,</L> 
<L>Say that every Thing stupid resembles my
L—d.</L></Q> I should be sorry, by producing these Pieces, to be
thought to harbour the least Resentment, for the Fate of my 
<PB N="260" REF="283"/> Marriage Poem; the Judgment of a P—r must ever
be Superior to that of the Insect, called a Scribbler, whose Views extend
no farther than a Dinner, or a Shilling; and I only relate these little
Anecdotes, to shew that I am quite incapable of resenting any Thing my
Su∣periors are pleas'd to do.</P>
<P>As this is the first Time I have been blessed with an
Opportunity, of addres∣sing the polite World, I find myself much inclin'd
to prate, though I already begin to fear I shall be censur'd for this
impertinent Intrusion, where I am an en∣tire Stranger; yet as I have got so
far, and my Publisher, who is a Man of real Taste, and distinguished
Abilities, neither of which, my Printer is destitute of; as they I say,
have not yet rejected any Part of this Appendix as Nonsense, I have a
strange Inclication to venture upon a Page or two more.</P>
<P>I remember to have seen amongst my Mother's Papers, an
Advertisement which she intended to have published in <HI>London</HI>;
and as it contains some Hu∣mour, <PB N="261" REF="284"/> I here recite it as
well as I can recollect. 
<Q> 
<P> Since it is become customary with every Person, to
advertise the Talents, they either in Reality or Imagination possess; I
have been told I have a Stock on my Hands, which is of no manner of use to
me, and having sold every Thing, but the Gift of God to me, if any Simon will
purchase I will dispose of it as follows:</P> 
<P> If any illiterate Divine, from <HI>Cam∣bridge</HI> or
<HI>Oxford,</HI> has a Mind to shew his Parts in a <HI>London</HI> Pulpit,
let him repair to me, and he shall have a Ser∣mon, not stolen from
<HI>Barrow, Tillot∣son,</HI> or other eminent Preachers, as is frequently the
Practice, with those who have Sense enough to do it; but Fire-new from the
Mint. If any Painter has a Mind to commence Bard without Wit, and join the
Sister Arts, I also will assist him. If any Author wants a Copy of
Commendatory Ver∣ses, to prefix to his Work, or a flat∣tering Dedication, to
a worthless Great <PB N="262" REF="285"/> Man; any poor Person, a Memorial
or Petition, properly calculated to dis∣solve the Walls of Stone and Flint
which invir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n the Hearts of rich
Men, P—tes in particular; any Print∣seller, Lines to put under his
humor∣ous, comic, or serious Representati∣ons; any Player an occasional
Pro∣logue or Epilogue; any Beau a hand∣some <HI>Billetdoux,</HI> from a fair
Incog∣nita; any old Maid, a Copy of Ver∣ses in her Praise; any Lady, of
high Dress, and low Quality, such as are generally the Ladies of the Town,
an amorous melting delicate Epistle; any Projector a Paragraph in Praise of
his Scheme; any extravagant Pro∣digal, a Letter of Recantation to his Honoured
Father; any Minister of St—te, an Apology for his Conduct, which
those Gentlemen frequently want; any Undertaker a Funeral Elegy; or any
Stone-Cutter an Epi∣taph; or in short, any Thing in the Poetical Way; shall
be dispatched in the most private, easy, and genteel 
<PB N="263" REF="286"/> Manner by applying to me, and that at the most
reasonable Rates.</P> </Q></P>
<P>I think this Advertisement may seri∣ously now serve for
me, since I find I have no Means of subsisting, but by a small
Smattering of Wit, which is some∣how inherent to me, to which I do assure
the Readers, nothing but Necessity could make me have Recourse. I too
well know, that the greatest Genius's in that Way, have been scarce able to
keep a Coat to their Backs; therefore if some generous, noble, or humane
Person, would bestow on me a small Annuity, which might barely set me
above Want, I would resign all Pretensions to the Pen, into the Hands of
those, who by Educa∣tion, and native Endowments, are better qualified to
use it. Some Persons of Rank who are inclined to banter, tell me they would
by no Means deprive the World of their Entertainment, by giving me a
Provision; but if they will please to con∣sider, that one
leisure-well-finished Line, is of more Importance, than Volumes 
<PB N="264" REF="287"/> written in a Hurry, they will be of another Mind. If the
great Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> had been possessed of an easy affluent
For∣tune, his Works, which are now almost buried in Oblivion, would have been
had in much greater Esteem than they are; since 'tis impossible to
think, but a Person of so extensive a Capacity, must at one Time or
other have produced something excellent.</P>
<P>And since I have said so much, one Thing more, Truth,
Gratitude, and Ho∣nour, compels me to say, which is in re∣lation to Mr.
<HI>James Worsdale,</HI> so often mentioned in these Memoirs. I'm sorry
I'm oblig'd to confess, that I think my Mother carried her Resentment too
far, in describing the Character of this Gen∣tleman; but all Persons who
have any superior Qualification, have generally some Imperfection adequate
to it, which is done by Providence, to shew us, that none are perfect on
Earth. Thus we see, an <HI>Apollo</HI> in Musick, a Swine in his Ap∣petite:
Thus <HI>Swift,</HI> unrival'd in Wit, was a Slave to Peevishness and ill
Tem∣per, <PB N="265" REF="288"/> which obscur'd his Merit, in the most
social Hour; and my Mother, who possest a pretty Manner of Writing, was
apt to fall too hard, on those whom she imagined herself injured by.</P>
<P>However, I'm convinced Mr <HI>Wors∣dale</HI> never did, nor
intended Injury to her, or any other Person, as he is good-natur'd to a
Fault, and as he has said himself, 
<Q> 
<L>Anxious to gain, but not to keep his Pelf,</L> 
<L>A Friend to ev'ry Creature but him∣self.</L></Q> And this is
a Truth that I can assert, having liv'd some Years in his House, which
was truly hospitable to every in∣digent Person that fell in his Knowledge,
but particularly such as had any Preten∣sions to Merit.</P>
<P>What my Mother has said of him proceeded from some little
Pique, and therefore I hope People who read it, will only laugh at her Humour,
but not seri∣ously <PB N="266" REF="289"/> reflect on it, to the
Disadvantage of a Person, who is incapable of acting, but with Honour,
Justice, and Integri∣ty, which will be more fully in my Power to
demonstrate, in the little Account I intend to give of my own Life.</P>
<P>And though it would exceed the small Limits I am prescrib'd,
to apologize to every particular Person, pointed at in this Volume, yet I
hope they will be hu∣mane enough, to harbour no Resentment against me, for
any Thing it contains, since I have before specified the Necessity I
was under of publishing it; and as many Characters are there, of which I am
really ignorant; so it would be im∣possible to break in upon the
Connection of one Part with another, by making Al∣terations, or leaving any
Part out.</P>
<P>There were some Persons, whom my Mother was highly obliged to,
and to whom, had she lived to compleat this Work, she would have returned
her Ac∣knowledgments publickly; one of them was the Earl of
<HI>Clanrickarde,</HI> a Noble∣man <PB N="267" REF="290"/> of most
illustrious Descent, and one who conspicuously retains the united
Vir∣tues of his Ancestors. My Mother hav∣ing wrote his Lordship a Letter
for a Subscription, he sent her in Return a most polite Epistle, which
I have now the Honour to possess, in which his Lord∣ship promised
shortly to favour her with a Visit, and in some Time he came. After
having sat about half an Hour chatting, he told her, he had promised to
subscribe to her Works, but that he imagined a Poem in her Praise,
written by himself, would be of infinitely more Service to her; upon which he
de∣livered her a Sheet of Paper, and she really believing him serious, was
about to open it. Pardon me, Madam, said my Lord, you must not read my
Verses while I am present, or you'll offend my Modesty. She laid the
Paper down, and shortly after my Lord took has Leave. When she
opened it, she found a Draft on <HI>Dillon</HI> and Company for twenty
Pounds. I hope I shall obtain his Lord∣ship's Forgiveness for the Freedom
I <PB N="268" REF="291"/> here take of mentioning his Name; but I think such
Actions, and such alone compose his Life, ought not to be ob∣scured; and
tho' doubtless this is but a trivial Instance of the Munificence and Honour
of that worthy Nobleman, yet as my Mother was an intire Stranger, and that his
Lordship did it purely in Compassion to her Sufferings and Regard to her
Talents, she ever esteemed both the Gift, and the Manner it was given in,
as the genteelest Thing that could possibly be done: and as she did not
sur∣vive to speak her Sentiments on that Oc∣casion, I hope I shall be
pardoned for attempting it.</P>
