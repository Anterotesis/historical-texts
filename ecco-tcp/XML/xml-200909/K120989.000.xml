<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THAT the art of Painting is not unjustly ranked in the humble class of imitative arts cannot be denied; but, were this its only claim to the attention of mankind, it would hardly be allowed the privilege of being called the sister of Poetry, and it is therefore evident that the rank, thus assigned to it, can refer only to the mechanical part, the <HI>language,</HI> as it may be termed, of the <HI>art;</HI> the <HI>means,</HI> and not the <HI>end;</HI> which bear nearly the same affinity to the genius and essence of painting, as the skill of the writing-master does to the muse of the poet. The various powers of paint∣ing, like Aesop's dish of tongues, may, ac∣cording to the management of them, be∣come
<PB N="ii" REF="4"/>come the instruments of the best or of the worst purposes. Painting addresses itself to our noblest faculties, and makes the highest pretensions: it is able to inflame the passions, delight the imagination, and correct the heart.</P>
<P>It may, with some, become a subject of doubt, whether the lessons of virtue are better enforced by the exhibition of grand and rare events, or the more humble and familiar circumstances of daily life: but a little reflection will ascertain, that, though the former may fill the mind for a while with tumult and astonishment, they, for the most part, leave untouched the affections of the heart, which the latter are calculated to enchain with irresistible interest, and, by that channel, to diffuse instruction more widely through the various ranks of so∣ciety.</P>
<P><PB N="iii" REF="5"/>The author of the Rambler has observed, that the downfal of kingdoms and revolu∣tions of empires afford few lessons applica∣ble to private life, the comfort or wretched∣ness of which flows from the right or wrong management of things, which are made considerable only by their frequency; that the mischievous consequences of irre∣gular desires and predominant passions are best discovered in those scenes, which are le∣velled to the general surface of the world, and which shew, in natural and familiar instances, by what means misery pursues guilt, that virtue is the highest proof of understanding, and that vice is the natural consequence of narrow thoughts, that it begins in mistake and ends in infamy.</P>
<P>The following series of designs has been constructed for the entertainment of young minds, <Q>easily susceptible of impressions,
<PB N="iv" REF="6"/>not fixed by principles, and therefore following the current of fancy,</Q> to whom the familiar objects, which it pre∣sents, may be productive of greater good than the solemnities of more stately exam∣ples. And it may be hoped, that, by dis∣playing with circumspection the natural contingencies of life, they will be seen in future with less hazard by the incautious and unexperienced, encourage to virtue, and warn from the delusive path of vice, which invariably leads to misery.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IT is the purpose, as we have already observed, of the following series of Pictures, to place in the strongest light the probable consequences of GOOD and BAD CONDUCT merely in this life. No∣thing so fully impresses the mind as EXAMPLE; and therefore two characters are chosen from a large class of society, in order to render the moral more extensively useful. But, though the characters are thus selected from one order of the community, the
<PB N="6" REF="8"/>moral is not confined to that order; for every person, in any other state, may apply the lesson at home, learn to avoid such conduct as necessarily leads to the loss of fortune and reputation, and, on the other hand, to act upon such principles as tend to raise the esteem of mankind, and, consequently, to procure their favour and protection. The exam∣ples, held forth in this work, consist of two FEMALE SERVANTS, who are supposed to live in the house of a young unmarried man of fortune. They are con∣ceived to be of an equal age, and upon a level with respect to situation, talents, and personal attrac∣tions. One, however, acts uniformly from motives of prudence, delicacy, and virtue; the other is careless, dissipated, and inclined to immoral gratifi∣cations. The progress of their conduct, and the fi∣nal result, illustrate that homely, but important, axiom in morals, <Q>"HONESTY IS THE BEST POLICY."</Q></P>
<P>The first picture unfolds, in some degree, the characters of the heroines of this graphic drama. The GOOD SERVANT is industriously employed in the proper duties of her station. The circumstances, in which she is placed, manifest order and economy, and display her natural disposition. The almanack implies that her time is always properly assigned to her respective duties. The introduction of the ant and the grasshopper is symbolical of the two cha∣racters;
<PB N="7" REF="9"/>which are also indicated by the picture over the door, representing the parable of the wise and foolish virgins.—The BAD SERVANT, a giddy wan∣ton girl, instead of minding her work, is playing; and the confusion and disorder, with which she is surrounded, afford an unpromising specimen of her future behaviour. The scheme of the lottery, above her head, shews that her mind is filled with foolish hopes of fortuitous prosperity, and that she is not likely to adopt the proper means for securing a situ∣ation of permanent comfort and respectability. She is supposed to be a <HI>coquette</HI> in her class; consequently, all the men-servants, who are toying with her, e∣qually share in her favours, and naturally take liber∣ties, where they meet with encouragement. The prudent old housekeeper, from a convenient sta∣tion, observes the whole, and expresses a compas∣sionate foreboding of the melancholy effects likely to result from such heedless proceedings. Hence may be inferred how necessary it is to check the first tendency to immoral pursuits, lest the passions should be rendered stronger by indulgence, till they lead the profligate to the last excesses of vice and infamy.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE next scene of our moral drama exhibits the heroines of the piece acting according to the qualities, which form the distinguishing features of their respective characters. The housekeeper, be∣nevolent from nature, and wise from experience, an∣xious to direct the unwary servant towards the paths of virtue, and to confirm the well-disposed girl in those good intentions which appear to guide her conduct,
<PB N="10" REF="11"/>is delivering such exhortations as observation and a knowledge of the snares, that overspread life, natu∣rally enforce. The girls are supposed to be in the housekeeper's room, called thither for the purpose of listening, undisturbed by the ridicule of the male∣servants, to the lessons of experience. And here we see a conspicuous proof of the feelings, that are likely to influence their future lives.—The amiable girl is meekly lending an attentive ear to the remarks of the sage and benevolent housekeeper, as if she hoped to derive from the discourse such a plan of behaviour, as may secure the approbation of her own conscience, and lead her through a life of innocence and tranquillity.—The other girl, compelled to at∣tend to a lecture repugnant to her feelings, can hardly preserve even the outward marks of deco∣rum, but shews, by a listless yawn, that she is deaf to all admonition, which may contradict the passions she is inclined to indulge, though misery and ruin should be the inevitable consequences. Her hand, indeed, seems to be lifted towards her mouth, as if to conceal the effect of a discourse which she thinks tedious; but the manner of the action shews, that it is rather the result of habit than dictated by any regard to civility. The disorder of her dress, in perfect opposition to the near attire of her fellow-servant, and the negligence of her attitude, contri∣bute to develop the licentiousness of her character; while the pocket-glass, which she has carelessly
<PB N="11" REF="12"/>dropped, completes the portrait of vanity and folly. — The china-closet, the books on the shelf, the de∣cayed finery of the chairs, which may be supposed to be discarded from better apartments, all indicate, as we said, the room of the housekeeper; a place, where advice could be given with the least chance of interruption.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE scene now represented may be considered as the natural consequence of what appeared in the two former pictures, relative to the character of the bad servant. Wholly devoted to the impulse of unruly passions, she no longer guards her door from the invasions of the midnight libertine; but, being now become the slave of appetite, meditates only the means of gratifying it. Her bed-room is
<PB N="14" REF="14"/>in disorder, and her clothes scattered around in care∣less negligence. The decorations of her apparel manifest the corruptness of her taste and the irregu∣larity of her desires; and the papers, which she has chosen as ornaments to her room, or rather as in∣centives to her misguided imagination, demonstrate her thoughts to have been more employed on such fallacious artifices as she thinks may add allurements to her person, than on the solid attainments, which may make her a desirable companion for life. A∣mongst these we likewise discover the portrait of one, whom she admired as a man of spirit. Devo∣ted to loose novels or idle love-letters, she appears to have endangered the house by her nocturnal stu∣dies, as is evidently seen by the smoke of a candle against the wall. Her garters display a love-motto, and the hat of her lover, in the corner, denotes that he is familiar to her apartment; where he is now conceived to be a constant visitor when the rest of the family have retired to repose. The pride and folly of her character is still farther observable in the name of <HI>Eliza,</HI> appended to one of her letters dropped upon the pillow; and which, taught by some of her silly romances, she has chosen as a more elegant appellation, and one more suitable to her ambitious hopes, than the vulgar name of <HI>Betty,</HI> by which she imagines herself degraded in her do∣mestic situation. After this general appearance of carelessness and sensuality, it is no wonder to find,
<PB N="15" REF="15"/>that her lover is stealing into her apartment; or that, in waiting for him, she sinks into slumbers, over which the images of her waking fancy still appear to preside.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WE have here a striking and interesting con∣trast to the subject of the last scene. In∣stead of any dissipated thoughts and licentious wishes, we see the good servant preparing for the season of repose by a proper submission to the Su∣preme Being; but, though employed in the duties
<PB N="18" REF="17"/>of religion, there is no appearance of gloomy me∣lancholy or frantic enthusiasm. Her conscience is wholly exempt from <Q>the compunctious visitings of nature;</Q> and, as her life is pure, her devotion is simple. The mild radiance of the silver moon, which appears through the window, gives a pleasing solemnity to the scene, and is symbolical of the chastity that marks the character of our good girl. The state of the room shews the regularity of her manners; the sampler, worked by herself, contain∣ing the <HI>Lord's Prayer,</HI> the <HI>twelve good rules</HI> of King Charles the First; a paper, inculcating the <HI>duty of servants</HI> to their employers; the <HI>Prayer-book;</HI> and the <HI>Young Man's best Companion;</HI> all tend to shew, that her feelings take a moral direction in every pursuit; and the print of <HI>connubial happiness</HI> indicates a well-regulated disposition to support the proper duties of a wife, when it shall please Provi∣dence to place her in that situation. Finally, the bolting of the door shews that she is prepared a∣gainst the assaults of the midnight libertine, who might reasonably be supposed to inhabit a mansion, where temptation and encouragement were so grossly held forth in the conduct of her profligate fellow∣servant. Upon this occasion, we may not unsuitably introduce the following passage from the pensive and amiable COLLINS:</P>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><PB N="19" REF="18"/>
<L>Come, thou, whose thoughts as limpid springs are clear,</L>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>HITHERTO our young wanton, however misguided her desires may have been, howe∣ver unfortunate the tendency of her conduct, has sound nothing to check the indulgence of her wishes, or the success of her youthful projects. We are now come to a period, where the scale begins to turn against her, and where instruction assumes a graver tone. The bitterness of sorrow, which suc∣ceeds
<PB N="22" REF="20"/>immoral pleasures, now forces itself on her heart. She perceives at once the fatal delusion of those dazzling allurements, which, glittering for a moment, and gaudy, like the colours of the rainbow, like those, are vanished and dissolved in tears.</P>
<Q><L>At length the destin'd hour was near,</L>
<L>That rose to fix her fate;</L>
<L>For, still on folly's wild career</L>
<L>Chastizing sorrows wait.</L>
<BIBL>LOVE's VICTIMS.</BIBL></Q>
<P>The irregularities of this thoughtless girl having been detected by the vigilance of the attentive housekeeper, she is now discarded with just dis∣grace, and turned out upon a world, ever more in∣clined to insult than pity the victims of imprudence; and she has thus, by her own misconduct, totally forfeited the protection of a respectable and friendly mansion, which might otherwise have been her constant shelter and comfort through the whole course of her life. On which-ever side she <HI>here</HI> casts her eye, the objects it meets may be readily con∣strued into omens of her future fate; on one, is pre∣sented a distressing instance of want and wretchedness; and, on the other, a scene of the most brutal de∣pravity. As she passes along, she is stung by the insulting scoffs and jeerings of her very associates, on whom she has lavished the unguarded dower of innocence; and who, untouched with pity for the degraded situation, to which they have contributed to
<PB N="23" REF="21"/>reduce her, now crowd the window to mock her sorrows. She has the mortification to find that the only persons, who still regard her with compassion, are those whom she before considered as enemies to her happiness, or, at best, as ill-natured spies on her conduct. Happy for her, (but she now per∣ceives it too late,) if she had been warned by those salutary reproofs, of which the intent and effort were to recall her from error, rescue her from danger, and avert the evil which has now fallen on her head.</P>
<P>With the little stock of her remaining apparel, and the more weighty evidence of her past miscon∣duct, she takes a melancholy, solitary leave of her late happy abode, to which she dares not look back. — The amiable girl, so lately her companion, has attended her to the door, and expresses for her that compassion, which the view of misery, however merited, always excites in a tender and feeling mind. Conscious of her unavailing regret, she hides her sorrows on the neck of her revered protectress and guardian, who stretches out her hand to bestow on the parting steps of the wretched wanderer a last and fruitless benediction.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN the scene now before us, we find the amiable subject of our story involved in circumstances likely to tempt her to evil, if her virtue were not founded upon the strongest principles, that morality can dictate and religion enforce. Her master, a gentleman in the bloom of youth, recommended by an agreeable person, and possessing a fortune capable of supporting her in luxury and splendor, if she could be wrought to listen to his licentious
<PB N="26" REF="23"/>advances, has watched his opportunity, and rushed into the bed-chamber, while she was putting it in order, for the purpose of taking her unawares, and rendering her, if possible, a sacrifice to his ungo∣vernable passions. The disorder, that appears in her dress, shews that he has been rude in his attacks; but, finding that he was repelled with all the firm∣ness of virtuous indignation, he has recourse to the milder expedient of persuasion, and has even been induced, by the eagerness of his wishes, to the condescension of kneeling, in order to soften and subdue her modest resolutions. All his efforts however are in vain, and produce no other effect than to make her turn weeping out of the room, at the consciousness of being subject to such an in∣dignity because she is in a servile situation, and therefore supposed incapable of a high sense of ho∣nour. This conduct, were the mind altogether depraved, might be expected to excite a spirit of resentment in her master, that would have ended in the loss of her place, if her own delicacy did not induce her to withdraw from a scene of such an insult: but her master, though betrayed by tem∣porary passion, such as the dissipation of modern manners is too apt to stimulate and encourage, is a man of sense and feeling, and therefore is likely, on reflection, to view our heroine with sentiments of respect and a nobler admiration. — Here, as in the foregoing scenes, the embellishments of the
<PB N="27" REF="24"/>room bear close analogy to characters and events, and tend to illustrate the main design. Cupid, on the chimney-piece, is discharging an arrow, the point of which is directed to the master of the house, while he is in his submissive state of liber∣tine entreaty. In another part, Cupid is seen astride upon a lion, expressive of the power of <HI>love</HI> over <HI>strength.</HI> The Janus-head shews, in front, the face of Cupid, and, behind, that of a satyr; implying that love is too often used as the disguise to a pas∣sion of a much grosser nature. The allegorical picture above, representing Time discovering Truth, is to be considered as an auspicious omen of the recompense that waits on virtue.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>FROM the engaging scene of an unaffected and genuine modesty, which the solicitations of youth, wealth, and persuasion, were unable to van∣quish, we now turn our eyes to a picture of a totally different nature. Here the rash and deluded wan∣ton, elevated, as she falsely conceives, to the height of good fortune, encouraged and caressed by those, whose present gratifications are interested in seclu∣ding
<PB N="30" REF="26"/>her entirely from reputation and virtue, aban∣dons herself, amidst the most profligate of either sex, to the wildest tumults of riot and debauchery. That no galling remorse may steal in to frustrate the indulgence of licentious passion, sense and re∣flection are previously drowned in intoxicating li∣quors, while the various luxuries of the table (now overturned before them) shew that every means, prodigality could devise, has been eagerly employed to screen this abode of revelry from the painful return of reason and recollection, which, like the golden beam of day, lighting the vault of the dead, would but have served to discover the hideous ob∣jects it contains. We see our heroine bestowing the disordered caresses of intoxication on her pa∣ramour, who is distinguished by the apparatus of a highwayman, and who is on the eve of paying the forfeit of his depredations on the public. She lifts an ill-poised bumper over his head, and drinks to his fortunate escape from the perils which are now evidently impending, while one of her fe∣male companions, equally depraved and abandoned as herself, in a fit of drunken jealousy, threatens to tear her, by violence, from the arms of this favorite desperado. In the mean time, the noisy roar of their disorderly mirth has attracted the ob∣servation of the constable of the night, who, at∣tended by watchmen, link-boys, and a mob of various description, has forced his way into the
<PB N="31" REF="27"/>riotous assembly, to the no small consternation and dismay of those few in it, who are still able to form a competent judgement of their own danger. One of these is seen hiding himself under the table, in order to watch a convenient opportunity of esca∣ping, and another attempts to get up the chimney, with the same intent. The landlady of the house appears alarmed for the credit of her mansion, in which she fears, not without reason, that her own may be eventually implicated. Fear however is by no means the predominant expression of the company. Several are resolute in resistance of the lawful guardians of the night, and threaten to fire on those who attempt to seize them. One, still awake to the usual employment of his more sober thoughts, is busied in securing to himself the deserted stakes of the gaming-table; while another, under pre∣tence of assisting the female combatant, whom we have mentioned, is attentive to the opportunity of purloining her watch and trinkets from her side: just emblems of the friendship of such profligates, whose union is cemented only by conspiracies of mischief. The remaining guests appear totally lost in the delirium of drunkenness, and one, more ea∣sily vanquished and more unfortunate than the rest, is lying in senseless intoxication on the floor, while a pistol, on the lock of which the candle has just fallen, threatens him with instant destruction.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="28"/>The decorations of the room need no comment. The picture representing Venus scourged by Mer∣cury, the figure of Liberty without a head to guide its activity, the vicious Loves which form the frame of the broken looking-glass, the cards, dice, pis∣tols, &amp;c. some the emblematical, some the real complement of such a scene, all speak sufficiently for themselves. One allusion however, if not noticed here, may perhaps escape the attention of the spectator, viz. that of the two pistols lying on the overturned table in such a direction as shews they have been presented against each other, which is meant to indicate what is very probable to have passed amongst those who herd together without so∣cial confidence, and in whom mutual intimacy never fails to produce reciprocal distrust.</P>

<P>TO relieve the mind from the painful emotions naturally arising from the last disorderly scene, we are here presented with an earnest of the happi∣ness which our GOOD SERVANT is going to receive, as a reward for the virtue she has preserved from the contagion of example and the snares of tempta∣tion. Her master has found it impossible to efface the impression of her personal attractions; and, as
<PB N="34" REF="30"/>the uniform propriety of her conduct has added es∣teem to his love, after an ineffectual contest, main∣tained by his pride and the prejudices connected with the superiority of his fortune and rank, he has at last determined not to "barter happiness for state," but to raise the object of his desires to a situation, to which her virtues give her a just claim, and which her many excellent qualities may reasonably be expected to adorn. To obviate therefore all suspicion of any dishonourable artifice, which his former libertine assaults might induce her to appre∣hend, he has called her into his library, and has or∣dered the venerable housekeeper to attend as a wit∣ness of his formal offer of his hand in marriage. Young, handsome, and wealthy, it is natural to conceive that our heroine must have looked upon her master with feelings of regard, though restrain∣ed by humility, resulting from reflection on the dis∣parity of their conditions; and such a sentiment tends to enhance the merit of her former resistance. Nor is it to be supposed that the licentious advances, he made towards her, have excited an unconquera∣ble resentment, since they have been succeeded by respect and the just sense of her real value. The various emotions of surprize, modesty, pleasure, and gratitude, operate so forcibly, that she throws herself upon her knees; but is raised by her master, who kisses her trembling hand with ecstasy, while the friendly housekeeper is in an attitude of pious
<PB N="35" REF="31"/>acknowledgement to heaven for thus recompensing that goodness, which her maternal care and con∣stant admonitions had contributed to direct and confirm. — The ornamental part of this plate is still subordinate and accessory to the object generally in view. Several pictures adorn the room. That first entitled to our notice is supposed to be the fa∣mous work of GUIDO; the subject of which is, LIBERALITY rewarding MODESTY. The next re∣presents the triumph of love over a satyr; by which we are of course to understand, that the impulse of a brutal inclination has given way to a refined senti∣ment of virtuous tenderness. Another picture re∣presents a wedding, and, near it, is one of an allego∣rical kind, exhibiting the SEASONS dancing in a ring, while TIME is acting as musician; implying the continued happiness that is to be expected from an union of hearts, in which no sordid views of in∣terest have had the least share. The next picture is partly hid behind the door, to signify the awful mystery that veils a future state; but, as the subject is an angelic host, we are to infer, that bliss in ano∣ther life is to be the final lot of those who conduct themselves properly through the present. The pic∣ture of a storm is placed behind the master of the house, to indicate the struggles he suffered, while pride was contending with love in his heart; but the mental tempest has now passed away, as we see far∣ther exemplified by the picture of a calm on the
<PB N="36" REF="32"/>other side, expressive of the tranquillity of his feel∣ings; and, being a morning scene, of the opening prospect of connubial felicity.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE scenes, which we have hitherto contem∣plated, have progressively led us to one of the most affecting nature, in which we at length be∣hold the unhappy victim of vice and delusion arrived
<PB N="38" REF="35"/>at a catastrophe as miserable as the tenor of her life has been erroneous: such indeed as is the natu∣ral effect of the conduct we have before witnessed, and such as on a moment's recollection we shall perceive to be more immediately the consequence of the unhappy state of riot and debauchery in which we last left her.</P>
<P>The splendor of vanity, the intemperance of laughter, the feverish triumph of presumption and heedless arrogance, are ceased. While the wanton flew headlong and irrevocably through the paths which pleasure has strewed with blossoms torn rude∣ly from the stalk, she was not aware that poverty and disease lurked on her way; they have assailed her, they have seized her, they have laden her with anguish, which she was equally unprepared and una∣ble to support, and the sufferings of a distempered frame are at last about to be closed in death.</P>
<P>The present scene exhibits the poor friendless prostitute in the agonies of expiring life, destitute of every means of relief, and wanting all those conso∣lations and supports, which in this awful period at∣tend the virtuous. An outcast from society, which she has dishonoured; banished from that humanity and benevolence, whose protection she has forfeited; to whom in this hour of extreme necessity does she consign herself, to watch the painful moments of
<PB N="39" REF="36"/>her dissolution? The minister of this charge, <Q>fit watch in such a night,</Q> is before us. A wretch, in whom, hardened by being a continual witness of such scenes of misery, every vestige of feeling ap∣pears to be finally extinguished. Callous to the an∣guish she was hired to relieve, instead of attending to the pitiable object of her care, assiduously inqui∣ring her wants, or administering comfort to her last moments, her only solicitude appears to have been habitually directed to herself. Her body sweltering and bloated with gluttony, the dram and cordial "standing rubrick" on her cheek, this miscreant, wholly inebriated, snores over the exhausted flaggon, while the lamentable victim of more fatal imprudence, dropping the phial of unavailing medicine, expires unnoticed at her feet. — Such is inevitably the mi∣serable exit of those, whom a disgraceful and an ill∣spent life leaves disregarded and forlorn in death.</P>
<P>In a gloomy chamber, near whose door a rope, suspended from the roof, reminds us of some former sufferer, who has sought relief in suicide, we be∣hold our unfortunate heroine, lying on a ruined floor, with no other bed than a little straw, while the fragments of a wretched meal and the tattered remnants of her former gaiety, a faded feather, hat, and cloak, are strewed on the ground around her, and at her side a poor little innocent, ignorant of its pitiable situation, embraces with filial tender∣ness
<PB N="40" REF="37"/>his cold and lifeless mother, on whose ear the last sounds that vibrated, were the cries of this her now destitute and helpless orphan.</P>
<P>From objects, the one so affecting, the other so disgusting, we should shrink at once with terror, if our attention were not more pleasingly drawn to the engaging and now doubly-interesting appearance of the former amiable friend and companion, who, though too late to afford the relief that would have gratified her tender heart, has sought out the gloo∣my retreat of poverty and shame; and, overcome with grief at the sight which presents itself to her, wipes from her eyes the tears that fall for the suffer∣ings of a fellow-creature; <Q>"Tears, from sweet Virtue's source, benevolent to all."</Q></P>
<P>Prepared to offer every means of assistance, she has filled her frugal purse with the savings of her own industry, and the larger bounty which her en∣treaties, ever the ready advocates of distress, have obtained from the worthy and benevolent house∣keeper. In the hurry of taking her purse from her pocket, she has dropped her <HI>housewife;</HI> which be∣ing observed by the little messenger of gluttony, just returning to the old nurse with a fresh supply of her favourite cordial, accustomed to watch the op∣portunities of knavery, he is artfully employed in
<PB N="41" REF="38"/>drawing it, by means of a crooked stick, towards the door, behind which he hides himself during the commission of the theft. A melancholy pre∣sage of that ruinous course of life, which must bring him to the most fatal and disgraceful end.—The principal intention of the scene, exhibited to us in this picture, may be more forcibly impressed by the following lines:</P>

<P>AS in the last scene was ended the life of one, the disastrous heroine of these designs, in the present, the other, the <HI>good girl,</HI> is supposed to have received a reward acquired by virtuous perseverance in her duty, and is become the wife of
<PB N="44" REF="40"/>a man, in whom the strict propriety of her beha∣viour has changed illicit desire into respect and love; and we are thus arrived at the conclusion of our moral drama. The hand of the wealthy and gene∣rous master atones for the indiscretion which had served to prove the virtues of this child of modes∣ty; and she is, in the bloom of life, raised to a state of affluence, and placed in the possession of all that promises the utmost happiness in this world. After mutual faith plighted at the altar, the ena∣moured bridegroom conducts her to his carriage, and her old friend and guardian, the benevolent housekeeper, enjoys the heartfelt satisfaction of see∣ing her pious admonitions thus singularly recom∣pensed.</P>
<P>While, on one side of this picture, so bright a prospect opens itself before us, on the other, we see the last sad offices paid to the remains of the once gay, healthy, and beautiful wanton. The clergy∣man, still interested in the happiness of the young couple, whose hands he has joined, advances to per∣form the solemn rites: but his sacred character is not sufficient to inspire in the attendants of the fu∣neral that decency which the occasion surely de∣mands. The cossin is surrounded by the former comrades of the deceased, amongst which the drunken nurse, who was present at her last mo∣ments, is distinguished by the same intemperance
<PB N="45" REF="41"/>that before marked her character; to the indulgence of which all times and all circumstances are, under various pretences, made equally subservient. To those of a lighter or more licentious turn of think∣ing, who are inclined to look rather with compas∣sion than censure on her whose follies are now laid for ever in the dust, it will afford some consolation, that all sorrow, all suffering, all pain, and all re∣morse, are here closed in the peaceful grave; but a reflecting mind, endued with real sensibility, will not forbear to sigh on recollecting that a youth of hopeful promise, a temper suited to hilarity, and a health calculated to sweeten toil and render virtuous industry delightful, were all wasted with thankless profusion in the gradual destruction of every bodily and mental consolation, and life at last hastily cut off in misery.</P>
<P>How strikingly contrasted is the fate of these two girls, of whom we are now going to take leave! Both started in the race of life with equal preten∣sions to hope and success. The one, by a placid and even course, has reached a goal, to which pru∣dence directed and virtue led her; the other, dis∣daining the bridle of instruction, flung herself mad∣ly on precipices and quicksands, in which she is at last fallen and overwhelmed.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="42"/>The several incidental circumstances introduced into this picture, though not immediately dependent on the principal subject, must not be wholly passed over without notice. On the wall of the church we perceive a fragment of a broken monument, which was formerly placed there in the vain presumption of perpetuating the memory of its now-forgotten object; its boast being rendered ineffectual by the ravages of time or accident, which have swept away the name of him whom it was intended to im∣mortalize. In the corner of the picture, a chim∣ney-sweeper, carelessly insulting over the dead with a triumph which he knows must now be suf∣fered with impunity, is seated on the tomb of a stately warrior, whose rank once inspired awe, and whose looks struck terror into the hearts of all be∣holders. What greater humiliation of mortal vani∣ty, or what greater proof can be exhibited that every man's best monument is found in his vir∣tues, and that distinctions cease to be regarded with reverence, when they are no longer useful to the world.
<Q><L>— Thus pass the proud away,</L>
<L>The gaze of fools, the pageant of a day.</L>
<BIBL>POPE.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>It may perhaps seem necessary to make some a∣pology for representing an union between persons of unequal rank as the specimen of a reward, which
<PB N="47" REF="43"/>should excite others to imitation. In the view of a general rule, it cannot be doubted that, from the many favourable co-incidences of manners, con∣nections, and opinions, which arise from a simila∣rity of education in similar stations, the most fre∣quent chances of happiness will be found in a part∣ner of equal rank; but it will surely be allowed that virtue and merit may be found equally in the lower as in the higher classes of life, and that these endow∣ments will generally meet with their reward. In an instance like the present, a virtuous young woman, whose amiable disposition and qualities have been demonstrated in every part of her conduct, is suffi∣ciently proved to be a valuable acquisition to any rank; and it will scarcely be denied that no fortui∣tous difference of manners or deportment can so far supersede her real virtues as to become a bar to the most perfect state of domestic connubial happiness. A short review of the scenes, in which she has been shewn, will serve to evince this truth: — in the first stage of this work, she is represented as careful and industrious; in the second, she meekly, humbly, and with a due sense of its value, receives whole∣some instruction and admonition; in the fourth, she shews innocence and piety; in the fifth, a tender and compassionate heart; in the sixth, inflexible chas∣tity; in the eighth, gratitude, modesty, and humili∣ty; and, in the ninth, she appears benevolent, charitable, and forgiving.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="44"/>Surely the question may with safety be asked, whether such a character does not deserve a reward, at least equal to that with which she is crowned in this our GRAPHIC and (we trust we shall again be allowed so to call it) our MORAL DRAMA.</P>
