<ARGUMENT>
<P>CONTAINING A CONFLICT, SOME RETROSPECTION, A PICTURE, AN
ATTEMPT AT AN ATONEMENT, AND ANOTHER AT AN IMPOSITION.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THOUGH Charles betrayed no symptoms of un∣easiness in his
face when he left the room, after the adventure at the inn, perhaps no heart
ever was torn with more poignant distress. Love, prudence, and disdain
assailed his heart at once, and he went to bed absorbed in a conflict of
wretchedness, com∣pared to which his last sleepless reflections in the
prison at Lyons were rapture.</P>
<P>At that time his conscious innocence and the <PB N="6" REF="4"/> wrongs that were done him roused his honest forti∣tude till it
towered superior to all possible conse∣quences. Now mark the
difference: After taking the resolution, upon the most laudable grounds, of
never holding communication with those who had traduced him, after fortifying
himself against all the bewitching power of Annette's charms, after
sus∣taining a long illness, caused and continued by those fond and
importunate whisperings which would fain have stimulated him to clear
himself, and reap the glory of obtaining his wishes by the defeat of his
rival, after at length congratulating himself upon the full establishment
of his health, and in that his staunch determination to abide by what he had
resolved, to fall into the most effectual means of opening a wound that had
been all but mortal, and, at this time only cicatrized, was a trial one would
think, under which his whole resolution must for∣sake him. It would
certainly be a trait of perfect nature if the reader found him the next morning
familiarly at breakfast with Sir Sidney and his fa∣mily. The very reverse
however happened, which I shall contend is fairly as natural, upon the
prin∣ciple of two vessels, which standing upon different tacks, may yet
meet each other with the same wind. In short, had his down been points of
needles, he could not have shifted, twined, and turned himself 
<PB N="7" REF="5"/> about with greater pain, nor at every new position have
met with a more novel torment.</P>
<P>The charms of Annette, coupled with the morti∣fying difficulties
which stood between him and his hopes, wounded him on one side in a
thousand places, which shifting to avoid the saucy familiarity of
Gloss, and the humility into which he was thrown by Sir Sidney's injurious
suspicions and ill judged pride, gave it him home.</P>
<P>He saw, he felt, he found himself conquered by Annette. Her
lovely, modest, speaking, soul-dis∣solving perfections stood
confessed, and he found himself their certain, evident, unequivocal
victim: but was this to overcome so reasonable a system of independant
integrity?—to throw down a structure of honest, hopeful tranquillity,
which it had taken him so much time and pains to rear?</P>
<P>In short, tossed about between such violent and
contending passions, he raved, sighed, swore, wept, execrated his fate,
and blessed his stars, till at length, his valet interrupting him with an
account that the horses were ready, he collected himself, rose, mounted,
and rode away before any person got up who could possibly stagger his
now inviolable reso∣lution.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="6"/> He made for Paris with every possible
expedition, where he endeavoured to lose, in that stream of pleasure,
those irresistable bars to his happiness which, spight of all his
resolution, presented them∣selves: so very difficult is it; in some
cases, for rea∣son to establish tranquillity.</P>
<P>After a month's stay at Paris, he returned to his native
country, where he will now be seen in the character of an independant young
man, without a single friend or adviser.</P>
<P>Here it will not be amiss to recount that strange train of
accidents which brought about so extraor∣dinary a meeting between Sir Sidney
and our hero at Aix la Chapelle.</P>
<P>Emma, since she found it in vain to tamper with Charles,
determined, if possible, to get at some in∣telligence of him through
Figgins, who, contrary to her expectation—for she thought it a forlorn
hope, as we may see by her last letter—not only informed her of his
motions, but corroborated his informa∣tion, by shewing her some
passages in his letters.</P>
<P>No sooner had Emma heard of our hero's sick∣ness, and
danger of being taken off by a lingering consumption, than, mad as it may
appear, she de∣termined <PB N="9" REF="7"/> to carry the whole family to be
witness to their handy work. This was certainly a trait worthy of her
sagacity. She anticipated her suc∣cess; and, enjoying her imaginary
triumph, pictured to herself the dying lover revived by the gentle and tender
attention of his mistress, and entreated to life and happiness by the
returning indulgence of her relenting father.</P>
<P>The only difficulty was how to bring it about; but even this was
no impediment to the genius of Emma. She revived the subject of Annette's
mo∣ther, which, since the information from Mr. In∣got, had only been darkly
spoken of through the medium of epistolary enquiry. Sir Sidney had, at
times, talked of a trip to the south of France, and Emma pressed Lady
Roebuck very hard to keep him to his intention: for which she offered many
notable reasons. It would wear off the chagrin that had been caused by
such an alteration in the family hopes; it would enlarge the ideas of
Annette, and if any lurking wish remained behind in favour of Charles, by
employing her mind on new objects, it would dispose her to receive with
more alacrity the solicitations of Mr. Gloss—for every body but
herself supposed Charles to be in Italy—whom, Emma was of opinion,
they ought to take with them, for reasons best known to herself.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="8"/> In short, this plotting jade had fairly
formed a pretty feasible plan of finishing this history, about the very
time when, and near the very place where, I, who knew better things, thought
proper to throw it into a new perplexity.</P>
<P>With very little importunity, Sir Sidney con∣sented to give
the ladies this jaunt. They took the route through part of Artois, to Rhiems,
and passed through Chalons to Dijon, near which city had lived the Count de
Gramont, who was an old intimate of Sir Sidney, and through whose interest
he now meant to make his enquiries. At this house they called, and, to the
great surprise and sorrow of the baronet, he found that the old count
had, four years before, paid the debt of nature, and that his only son, whom
Sir Sidney knew when a child, enjoyed now his title and his fortunes.</P>
<P>Sir Sidney was hospitably welcomed by the young count, who
beguiled away a week of their time very agreeably. The family then prepared to
continue their journey. No mention however would have been made of their
intended enquiries, had not the young count previously, and luckily too,
formed a design at this time to visit Province where he in∣sisted upon
making his father's friend welcome at a small estate in that quarter. The
fact is, he had <PB N="11" REF="9"/> fallen violently in love with Annette, and
nothing could have kept him from soliciting her hand from her father but the
evident certainty that Gloss was intended to be the happy man. Standing
pretty well however in his own opinion, and being a man of family and fortune,
he had but little difficulty to persuade himself he should soon
outshine his rival, if he could contrive to be of their party a little
lon∣ger. Growing, however, more and more enamoured every hour, and not being
able to stay till they ar∣rived at their journey's end, he had, on that very
day the reader and I were witnesses to his disgrace at Aix la Chapelle,
sustained a handsome, though positive, refusal from Annette, and
another from her father. Raging with disappointment, he flew to wine for
relief. This fired him ten times more, when coming to the inn, to bury his
intoxication and his wretchedness in sleep, he was stopt by his <HI>valet
de chambre,</HI> who, being the factotum of his amours, promised him the
accomplishment of that which he never before had the temerity to think of,
much less hope for. In short, after telling him a hundred lies, to inflame
him, he had the address, by the help of the chamber-maid of the inn, to place
him in a closet in the chamber where Annette was to sleep. He saw her
enter with Emma, who having set down the candle, began to look over some
linen and other things for Lady Roebuck.—As <PB N="12" REF="10"/> they
laid across her arm, 
<Q REND="inline">'Well really,' said she, 'there is no
knowing what to wear in this same France; it is the strangest, motley
place—'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Nay,' said Annette, 'there is a great deal to
gratify one's curiosity. The thing I like least in it is this troublesome
count. If he and Mr. Gloss were where my poor Charles is, and he in their
place, France would be a paradise to me.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Come, come,' said Emma, 'do not
despair.'—</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Despair,' answered Annette, 'why should I
hope? Were he here, did he love me—and that I am afraid Emma he does not,
be where he will—what would it avail me, designed as I am by the will
of the best, though, in this case, the cruelest, father for
another?'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Don't be uneasy about that,' said Emma, 'I
have a secret to cure your father and all the world of such a folly as that
would be. In short I am much more pleased that Mr. Gloss should be
in∣tended for your husband than any man in the world, since it must not
be Mr. Hazard. I cannot say so much for the count, for he has a thousand
advantages over the other, and if Sir Sidney were not so attached to his
parliamentary friend, we should find ourselves a good deal embarrassed
to <PB N="13" REF="11"/> get rid of the other. A painter—and it is the
same with an author, for words are figurative co∣lours—can put that
object in shadow which is a disgrace to the groupe, but he would be blamed
for doing this by one that ornaments it. But come, my sweet lady, I hope you
are nearer hap∣piness than you think for. One thing is—but you must
not betray it for your life—that Charles is not in Italy, and I hope it
will not be long be∣fore you see him!'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Not in Italy!' cried Annette, 'not long be∣fore
I see him! Do, my dear, my kind Emma, explain yourself.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'My lady waits for these things,' said Emma;
'I will tell you more when I return; till then be as happy in idea as the
pleasing picture I have drawn can make you.</Q> So saying, she retired,
with a view of going to Lady Roebuck.</P>
<P>Seeing there was no time to be lost, the count, the moment
this conversation was over, which he had listened to, but understood not
a word of, came out of his hiding place, and surprising An∣nette at the
door, locked it, and began, as we have seen, to be pretty free with her. He
was however so awed by her beauty, that he had very little shocked her
delicacy when she was relieved by our hero, <PB N="14" REF="12"/> whom she
no sooner saw, alarmed and confused as she was, than she could not
help fancying—the fore∣going conversation being strongly in her
mind—that the whole was one of Emma's romantic schemes. This, when they
retired to rest, she scrupled not to confess to Emma, laying before her
very strongly all the consequences of any premature design to de∣ceive
her father, which she was sure, if he disco∣vered, he would never
forgive, and which could not fail, instead of mending their affairs, to leave
them in a worse condition than ever. She thanked her with warmth, with
tenderness, with tears, for the attention she paid to her wishes;
declared that no one ever had a truer friend, but it was plain for∣tune
determined to persecute her, and therefore all her kindness would be
useless.</P>
<P>Emma was very much touched at Annette's good opinion of her, and
thanked her for it in terms of sincere acknowledgment. She lamented with her
the great probability that indeed there was of her fustaining more
persecutions, but she said it was the lot of virtue to be essayed,
but that, thanks to heaven, to those trials it owed its purity.</P>
<P>She said she knew well the implacability of Charles's
temper, which she was convinced would not relax a tittle; but this, in some
degree, she <PB N="15" REF="13"/> could not disapprove; for he had been very
ill treated.</P>
<P>Our hero's conduct indeed was, in Emma's opi∣nion, the noblest
she had ever heard of; but then she knew to what it was attributable. To
say the truth, she knew much more than the reader imagines; or perhaps
knows himself.</P>
<P>Emma acknowledged that she knew of his being in the south of
France, but that his coming there that afternoon was purely accidental: at
least she knew nothing to the contrary: for that she had not expected to
see him till they came to Montpelier, where he had been for many months at
the point of death, though it was plain he was now not only hap∣pily recovered,
but much handsomer than ever.</P>
<P>Night alone beheld those blushes which suffused
Annette's cheeks at these words. They were ex∣cited by a flattering hope, but
were as instantly dis∣sipated by intruding fear, which changed the
car∣nation to a pallid hue, and started two pearly tears, that trickling from
her beautiful eyes, lost them∣selves upon her pillow.</P>
<P>Emma said that though Charles must now stand much higher
in every body's mind than he had lately <PB N="16" REF="14"/> done, yet it was
plain Sir Sidney had felt himself treated with indignity, which would
operate, in conjunction with the insiduous arts of Gloss, to Charles's
great disadvantage. They would see how∣ever the result of matters in the
morning. In the mean time, she was glad the count's hopes were at an end; for
as to Gloss, she begged her lovely young lady to make herself perfectly
easy, for as he never could be her husband, which she would herself
take good care of, rather good than harm would come of his hovering about her;
for though a troublesome insect himself, he would serve to keep off
others who were more so. She said she held it good doctrine to use evil
agents to come at truth, and maintained that HOBBES is right where he says 
<Q REND="inline">'that it is law∣ful to make use of ill
instruments to do ourselves good;' and adds, 'If I were cast into a deep
pit, and the devil was to put down his cloven foot, I would take hold of it to
be drawn out.'</Q></P>
<P>The great object of Annette's concern was lest Charles did not
love her; which doubt Emma un∣dertook to dissipate. She said it was
impossible; he was the best and most charming young man upon earth, as
was she the most virtuous and lovely young lady; that she was as sure
they were born for each other, as if she read their history in the book of 
<PB N="17" REF="15"/> fate; but that troubles, and many yet, they cer∣tainly
were born to encounter.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Come, come,' said she, 'my dear Miss
An∣nette, you are very well off: our whole affairs are a novel, I confess,
but yours are not the distresses in which young ladies so situated
generally find themselves. Your father is not hard and boister∣ous, like
Western; nor is Gloss bewitching and seducing, like Lovelace. I can
dash his hopes in a moment, whenever I please. Comfort your∣self then, my
dear lady: you have in me a firm, and, though not very old, yet I will venture
to say an experienced friend; and I shall as surely pilot the vessel
into port, as that I am now con∣ducting it with skill and foresight, in
spight of all the adverse winds and beating waves that surround
it.'</Q></P>
<P>Emma was now in her element. She soothed An∣nette with every
kind and friendly argument her in∣vention—which was pretty
fertile—could supply. She instanced all the similar situations
she had read of, and proved to a demonstration that happiness was as
certainly the ultimatum of Annette's fortune, as that the interval would be
filled with many trials of her virtue, her temper, and her fortitude.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="16"/> Upon the whole, Mrs. Emma determined never
again to give a hint of what she had in agitation to Annette. Young and timid
as she was, who knew how far her prudence would be a security for her not
betraying it. She plainly saw that though Charles could not be robbed of the
palm he had so handsomely earned, yet, as Sir Sidney had expressed
himself in terms of great warmth, after our hero had left the room, this was
not the moment to press her present design.</P>
<P>After a variety of deliberations with herself, while Annette
slept, she determined to see Charles early in the morning, and advise
him to follow their steps, till she should give him a fit opportunity of
declaring himself; and in order to induce him to this, she would lay him
down the strongest reasons in her power, without trenching absolutely
upon some secrets which she meant to make use of as a <HI>denier
resort,</HI> lest he, from rage, should make as bad an use of them, as
Annette would from simplicity.</P>
<P>Having well digested this plan, she commended herself to
the arms of sleep, where she continued locked so long, that when she
came to enquire in the morning for our hero, he was some miles on his way to
Paris.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="17"/> I shall now recur to the scene of
action, out of which Mr. Charles was seen just now to stalk with such
conscious dignity.</P>
<P>When Sir Sidney and the rest first came into the chamber,
they really did not know what to think of the matter, it was so sudden and
unexpected; but as soon as they heard the Frenchman's handsome accusation
of himself, and found it impossible that our hero could be any other than
the champion of the lady, they really had the conscience to give him credit
for one worthy action; and, as truth has the knack of dispersing
falsehood in more ways than one, it all of a sudden struck Sir Sidney,
that Charles must either be strangely altered, or that report had not in
all cases done him justice; for that it was impossible, or at least
very unlikely, that any man should hold such a contrary disposition, as
to be a devil to-day, and an angel to-morrow.</P>
<P>These were Sir Sidney's reflections. Lady Roe∣buck's were
still kinder. Emma's were admira∣tion, and Annette's tender, delicate, lively
grati∣tude; and, feeling thus, they really made a very pretty group for a
picture.</P>
<P>Against the chimney piece stood the musing 
<PB N="20" REF="18"/> baronet, with his hand to his forehead. His beau∣tiful
daughter, who had accidentally fallen into an arm chair, held also her hand
to her face, which however did not conceal her tears of indignation for her
ravisher, or those burning blushes full of love and thanks to her
deliverer.</P>
<P>Lady Roebuck, though in astonishment too, by turns eyed her
husband, Annette, and Charles, with regards plainly intimating her perturbed
and anxious sensations; while Emma, firm and collected, searched every
eye, and would fain have pervaded every heart, to furnish herself with
arguments for that master-stroke she was now meditating.</P>
<P>Our hero, as I have already described, was trans∣fixed like
a statue; but it was rather like an inani∣mate body, whose soul had left
it, and fled to that heaven on which the eyes seemed to bend with re∣luctant
pleasure.</P>
<P>As to the count, he had his head against the wall, without
daring to look any one in the face.</P>
<P>Just at this critical moment every thing seemed to depend
upon the first word that should be <PB N="21" REF="19"/> spoken, which
unfortunately coming from the mouth of Mr. Gloss, our hero's love gave place,
or rather spur, to his resentment, and so threw him off his guard as to
occasion that disrespect which he shewed to Sir Sidney, and his abrupt
departure after∣wards.</P>
<P>Sir Sidney never felt so sensible a mortification in his
life. He was plainly upon the point of mak∣ing such advances to Charles as
very likely would have led to a complete reconciliation. He had balanced, as we
have seen, as to his deserts, from the first moment he felt that warm
sensation of ge∣nerous gratitude for his daughter's protection.</P>
<P>This prepossession in his favour, his person, which
called to mind a thousand partial ideas, did not a little contribute to
strengthen. How then must this fair prospect of engendering good-will be
un∣timely destroyed, when such a blight as our hero's terms of rebuke were
held out to one who expected solicitation instead of defiance! His kind
thoughts immediately receded, and resentment filled their place; but,
however, with so very little foundation, that he was obliged to search for
a new object to gratify it, and immediately insisted upon a full
ex∣planation from the count of his conduct.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="20"/> The count charged it very properly upon the
ras∣cality of his servant, whom he instantly called up, paid his wages,
and kicked out of the room: an example, were it more imitated, would save the
honour of many young gentlemen of pleasure.</P>
<P>The count then said his crime could not be pal∣liated,
otherwise he would never stir from An∣nett's feet till he had implored her
pardon, nor from Sir Sidney's presence till he had consented she should
be his. As it was, he would hide his dis∣grace in absence, and never again
presume to ap∣pear before a family whom he had treated—instead of the
respect due to strangers—with the ill manners and villany of a
ruffian.</P>
<P>He further said, he should love the young gentle∣man as long
as he lived who had prevented his de∣sign, and, were not his influence all
gone, he should strongly recommend him to Sir Sidney's friendship and
consideration.</P>
<P>With these words he took his leave, went to an∣other inn, and
the next morning left the town, about an hour after our hero.</P>
<P>A conduct so collected and uniform in one mo∣ment 
<PB N="23" REF="21"/> engendered a new plot in the imagination of Mr. Gloss. 
<Q REND="inline">'My dear Sir Sidney,' said he, 'this is the
most bare-faced business, I ever saw in my life: don't you see
it?'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Upon my word I do not even know what you mean,'
answered the baronet.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Why, my dear sir, nothing can be
plainer:—The count, whose overstrained complaisance in∣duced him to
accompany us to Province, did it to serve his friend, which you may easily
see by the latter part of his fine florid speech. Mr. Hazard was not in
Italy, but lurking about till you should come to France. For this was Miss
Roebuck to be insulted!—for this was she to be rescued!—for
this was the servant to be kicked down stairs! for this was the champion to
behave with insolence to you!—and, finally, for this was he, by the
re∣pentant ravisher—just the last man in the world who ought to
take such a liberty—to be recom∣mended to your favour and
consideration!!'</Q></P>
<P>Sir Sidney could not admit the entire force of this charge,
though he could not deny but it was clear, connected, and ingenious; and indeed
full of such apparent probability, that it might have naturally struck any
body. It was however late, and as his <PB N="24" REF="22"/> daughter at any rate
was safe, and peace restored, before they hazarded any further conjectures,
he thought it would be but wise to consult their pil∣lows. Thus Annette and
Emma were left to them∣selves, where passed that dialogue and those
delibe∣rations already mentioned.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER II.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>CONSISTING OF JOURNEYING AND CASTLE-BUILDING.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WHEN it was known the next morning that both our hero and the
count had left Aix la Chapelle, Sir Sidney, kept up to his belief by Mr.
Gloss, began in reality to think that the whole business of the night
before was a concerted matter between those two gentlemen. It wore so much
the com∣plexion of those tricks he had heard of before, and was in every
respect so like what he had been taught to think of the genius of our hero,
that it scarcely admitted of a doubt. But, were this the case, what did it
infer? Why, truly, because all his friends would not believe him innocent of
pranks that had been so substantiated, he must meditate an injury that
ought never to be forgiven. Did not his haughty speech at parting confirm it?
For even sup∣pose that he had no motive for what he did but common
justice, nobody would in so disdainful a manner refused to be thanked.
No, the matter <PB N="26" REF="24"/> was apparently very plain, and if really
what it ap∣peared, it only proved that he whom they had hopes of a penitent,
had now given proof that he was incorrigible. But were it allowed to be
possi∣ble—which there was very little ground for—that all this
strange business should have been the mere effect of chance, was it,
even in that case, a proper thing to lie at the caprice and whim of an
absurd young man? Was it through pride and disdain he meant to aim at
conciliation? Did he expect to be begged and entreated to forgive? Had he so
far forgot all the duties resulting from those motives which alone could
worthily have excited such con∣duct as to think it ought to erect him into
pride and haughtiness? And, lastly, had he the vanity to suppose that
having left the town, be the motive what it might, any body would take the
trouble to send after him?</P>
<P>Weighing all these considerations, Sir Sidney was determined
to repay pride with pride, and though, if it ever came to his knowledge as a
positive cer∣tainty that Charles had acted in this business
disin∣terestedly, he should conceive himself under an obligation, he
should nevertheless look upon it as one of that sort which a vain
supercilious conduct had completely cancelled.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="25"/> Thus was the baronet at least as firmly
set against our hero as ever he could be against the baronet, and fully
confirmed in these sentiments, which Gloss failed not to extol.</P>
<P>Lady Roebuck, Annette, and even Emma, though not obliged to
acquiesce, were at least prohibited from making objections.</P>
<P>To bring them to England as fast as possible, where I am
impatient to attend our hero, it will be only necessary to say a few
words.</P>
<P>They kept on their way for Province, where Sir Sidney found
every thing very much altered. The former abbess of the convent where
Annette's mo∣ther was supposed to have died, had been replaced some
years, and her successor could give no more account of the matter than
that she understood Miss Le Clerc had gone to England, with
permission, some years before. In short, she told Ingot's story,
with the addition of her having returned, settled her affairs, made
interest to be of a new order, more suitable to her circumstances, to a
certain convent of which order she had retired at a distant town, where it
was said they might hear further tidings of her.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="26"/> Sir Sidney, finding Lady Roebuck and Emma
very anxious to get at the bottom of this business—for as to Annette,
she was always taugh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to believe
that her mother was dead—indulged t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eir curiosity, though this same town was out of their road to
Pa∣ris. The scent however was soon lost, for Miss Le Clerc had
shifted her place of residence one more, and they either could not or would
not give the smallest information weere she was gone: they therefore got
away expeditiously to Paris, at which city they arrived a few days after our
hero had left it, and after passing away about five weeks very
pleasantly, returned in safety to their own coun∣try.</P>
<P>Charles, in his way to Paris, to drive Annette from his
thoughts, began to consider in earnest what he should do in the world. He
was young, had a tolerable right to think well of his abilities, and would very
shortly touch a large sum of money.—He had all his life employed his
time industriously, and thought he should now wrong his country and
himself if he let his talents rust in indolence.</P>
<P>The sublimest wish of his heart was to patronise merit.
He should not however, he feared, find him∣self rich enough. He must oke
out his fortune then. To effect this, he hit upon fifty schemes, 
<PB N="29" REF="27"/> but was not able to pitch on any thing he thought likely
to answer his purpose, till he met with an English nobleman in Paris, who
initiated him in the mystery of preferment, and plainly shewed him all its
devious and intricate paths.</P>
<P>Charles contemplated this road to fortune with eager pleasure.
His booby brother was a lord; his supercilious rival a member of parliament
and a po∣pular speaker: should he then live a mere obscure private
gentleman!</P>
<P>In short, he bargained with the peer for a bo∣rough. The peer,
on their arrival in England, made the broomstick, who was then member,
va∣cate his seat, by an acceptance of the Chiltern hun∣dreds, and, at the
expence of something more than eight thousand pounds, our hero found
himself a member of the third branch of the legislature.</P>
<P>My lord, by convention, was to follow up Charles's initiation
with his patronage, which had only the trifling condition annexed to it of
always voting with the minister. A fortnight however did not pass before
the impossibility of this was made self-evident.</P>
<P>He had consented to the purchase of a borough, 
<PB N="30" REF="28"/> because he had been told that such things are as
openly sold as shoes and stockings, or any other article that a man
chuses to appropriate to himself, upon paying its full value, or perhaps a
little more, but to support that it was noon-day at mid-night—or indeed
any of those many positions he was almost ordered to second—to
hold forth for three hours to the great detriment of his lungs, and, what is
worse, of his varacity, with a view, like legerdemain, of shewing a
question in every possible point of view but the right, and then
sanction this outrage on truth, this fraud on his own conscience, by voting
that it might be carried into a law, and so be ac∣cessary to the
multiplying of these outrages and these frauds to the detriment of his
fellow citizens!—this was a condition he could not prevail on himself
to fulfil, and therefore—at which he wondered, with∣out cause—the
parliament being dissolved in about five months after he took his seat,
our hero's bo∣rough, notwithstanding a fresh three thousand pounds which
he laid out in contestation—though how it should be spent is
astonishing, for the place had not above thirteen houses—received
its former member, Mr. Stopgap, who, as complaisantly as before, in less
than a twelve-month took again the Chiltern hundreds, that the borough might be
pur∣chased by a new bubble, who however bought it with better success
than our hero, for, by always <PB N="31" REF="29"/> saying aye, he soon got
a pension well worth the money he had paid for it.</P>
<P>By the way, Charles's conduct in parliament was the most
curious thing in nature. Having no bias but truth, his opinions seemed to
wear a very motley and strange appearance, to those who were hack∣neyed in
the way of debate; but indeed he was, as Kiddy would call it, up with them; for
even those who argued on the same side, by having imbibed a passion
for rhetoric, a quaintness of expression, a vein of drollery, or some
other quality of embellish∣ing and flattering truth out of the very form they
ought to wish it should wear, appeared to him the most unhandy handlers
of an argument that could be conceived. In short, he was an innovator, and
nobody was sorry to lose him; for, said they, a man who votes sometimes
on one side, and some∣times on the other, can be of no party, and
there∣fore ought not to be a member of the house of commons.</P>
<P>Sir Sidney, it is true, as an independant country gentleman,
voted with his conscience, but yet this was generally on one side; for, by
prejudice of education, he was pretty well fixed as to his senti∣ments
concerning the government of this country. In short, every thing that
promoted the blessing of <PB N="32" REF="30"/> peace, he supported; every
thing that led to the desolation of war he discountenanced.</P>
<P>By the way, Sir Sidney and our hero considered one another as
perfect strangers during the whole time they sat together as members.</P>
<P>Charles, when he returned to England, received of Mr. Balance
the gross sum of twenty-nine thou∣sand pounds. His borough and his
private ex∣pences had, in seven months, sunk this sum to nearly half.
This nettled him not a little. To set out with the laudable intention
certainly of exalting himself, but with the purest motives of public
in∣tegrity, and sustain in so short a time so much
dis∣grace!—it was not to be borne. He had given proof, on many private
occasions, that he could wield a pen; he was determined to try whether he
could not do it, and to effect, on a public one.</P>
<P> He lost no time, but immediately brought out a pamphlet which
he called "Parliamentary Consis∣tency." It was pithy, sensible, and
severe, and laid bare all the manoeuvres of making and garbling acts of
parliament; shewing that as chicanery was engendered with law, no wonder if
it grew up with it.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="31"/> Nothing however was gratified in this
business but revenge. A few sensible people found a great deal of merit
in the publication; the booksellers declared that the young man touched in
pretty, smart, round periods enough, and that when his for∣tune should be
spent, they would be glad to employ him at <HI>per sheet.</HI></P>
<P>The active mind of our hero would not let him sit down quietly
under so heavy a reduction of his fortune. He thought every hour an age till
he should be engaged in something to redeem his loss. Had he remained in
parliament for any length of time, he had no sort of doubt but he should
have completed all his wishes, without the interference of the
minister.</P>
<P>He had, with great accuracy, noticed where the laws were
deficient in relieving the poor and op∣pressed, and indeed all
descriptions of mankind in helpless situations. He had expected, upon
point∣ing out amendments in these laws—which he con∣ceived could
easily be done—he should erect him∣self into such popularity,
that he could command assistance from that state to which he should
thus have been so useful.</P>
<P>As it was, he had made but little progress in 
<PB N="34" REF="32"/> this desirable pursuit; nevertheless, what he had
done was a beginning, and it actually had raised an alarm among
forestallers, engraters, and other ene∣mies to the lower part of the
community.</P>
<P>He had also a plan of inducing a parliamentary attention to
the liberal arts, and he meant, as a preliminary step, to try at a regulation
of public amusements.</P>
<P>Many other benevolent ideas occupied his thoughts, tending both
to public accommodation and private convenience; but the scheme that most
delighted him was one by means of which he had flattered himself he should
be able to curtail the privileges of lawyers, whose emoluments drained from
the necessitous, he proved by computation, amounted to a third more upon
any twenty given causes, than the damages given in those causes by the
jury; and were the aggregate account of ex∣pences and damages come at for
seven, or seventeen, nay or seventy years, he had reason to think the
proportion would be just the same.</P>
<P>This clearly proved that a man, with ever so just a cause,
had better put up with a first loss, let it be what it might, than seek
the only redress the laws <PB N="35" REF="33"/> of his country had permitted
him to have recourse to. Yet no step had been taken to cure this evil.</P>
<P>His catalogue of such abuses as came under the cognizance of
the courts was immense. Those abuses of which the courts had not the
smallest idea were a still larger list, and proved that the sole mode
the legislature had provided to decide those two grand articles by which
all the ties of good-fellow∣ship are cemented, by which ranks are
distinguished, property ascertained and secured—In short, right
and wrong;—instead of holding out security, and being a blessing,
was a curse, in a land of freedom, that the most oppressive tyranny had
never equalled in any country.</P>
<P>This last enumeration of abuses, he said, was the most
grievous thing that could be conceived to peo∣ple of middling life. These
abuses consisted of pro∣cesses that went no farther than arrests
and accom∣modations, in which the attornies, though adverse
professionally, were privately intimate friends.—These erected
themselves into judge and jury, and the result was nine times out of ten
that the defen∣dant, to avoid imprisonment, was forced into terms
impossible to be complied with.</P>
<P>Could any provision take in all it was meant to 
<PB N="36" REF="34"/> comprehend which failed of effect in any particular? The
laws of England did in a very essential parti∣cular: they precluded the
poor from any benefit from them, while the rich could use them to op∣press
that very poor for whose defence—if by law is meant human
security—benevolent reason says they ought in an especial manner
to provide.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'How can this be?' says the lawyer; 'the poor
may sue in <HI>forma pauperis.</HI>'</Q> What do they gain by this? Why truly
they are allowed the stamps, but who will allow them an attorney that will
manage their affairs for a single farthing less than his full
fees?—which always include three-fourths of his bill.</P>
<P>These, as I have said, were some among the many
resources from which Charles hoped to draw much public benefit; nor did he,
o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> these subjects, appear to
have a superficial judgment, for he had such sweetness of manners, and
was so void of any pride, except that which results from conscious
in∣tegrity, that he did not disdain to search for infor∣mation among
those where alone he could demon∣strably find it.</P>
<P>To say truth, in conjunction with a few other 
<PB N="37" REF="35"/> worthy members of parliament, he bent his time to a full
consideration of cases, entirely among the poorer part of the community;
and it was not rare to see him at work-houses and prisons, where his
purse secretly following his generous heart, bellow∣ed on him as much
satisfaction, by relieving a widow or an orphan, as some men—his
brother perhaps for one—would have received in distressing a
tenant, or seducing his daughter.</P>
<P>Finding however all his hopes no more than a dream—from
which he had been so disagreeably awoke—he had now no ability but to
pity those whom he could no longer assist!</P>
<P>He might, to be sure, have purchased another borough, but he
now saw the fallacy of such traf∣fic, and well knew that if he could
ensure a feat as long as he should live, it would be utterly
im∣possible for him to carry any one point, till he had previously sold
his opinion, and then what would he be but the echo of another man's will,
without having a will of his own.</P>
<P>Determined however to do all he could—slender as his
means were—he concerted several feasible plans, by which, while he
reasonably improved <PB N="38" REF="36"/> his money, he fancied he should
procure a most desirable relief to many who stood in need of such
assistance.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER III.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>THE RATIFICATION OF ONE TREATY, AND THE INFRACTION OF
ANOTHER.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WHILE Charles is digesting his liberal plans—that I may
keep this history compact, and all its characters within view—I shall
recur a little to such persons and things as may enable me so to do.</P>
<P>In the first place, I do not wish the reader should fancy
that I made Charles all of a sudden so vio∣lently in love with Annette, at
Aix la Chapelle, for no better purpose than merely to put him into a mad
freak or two, and there an end. It is true, he swore a great many bitter
oaths that he would sooner tear his tongue from his mouth, and his heart from
his bosom, than suffer one to speak or the other to dictate a single
syllable that could betray the folly of loving one whose family
undeservedly despised him. But does not the reader know that this was
rather what he uttered, than what it was in his power to put in practice. Was
he not a lover? <PB N="40" REF="38"/> Did not the positive confirmation of
that fact take its date from the business of Aix la Chapelle? And could any
thing he afterwards said or thought be considered in any other light than
as the declara∣tion of a maniac, who, in the midst of a paroxism, tells you
he is in his right senses? The injunction he laid upon his tongue was well
enough, and I question whether the threatened mutilation, or some∣thing
like it, might not have followed its infringe∣ment. But as to his heart! Lord
help the poor man! It was about as much in his power to direct that, as it
would be for a miser to prevail upon him∣self to give a poor wretch a
guinea whom he saw expiring for want.</P>
<P>In short, we see him prancing about from one wretched object
to another, and persuading, amus∣ing, interesting, wheedling, and coaxing
this same heart into all the amusements for which such kind of men
directors are worthily formed; and to be sure I cannot deny but this master
of his had much pleasure in this sort of employment:—but this made no
difference: it repaid him with interest the mo∣ment it was unoccupied, and
even brought up these very actions to support its arguments, crastily
sug∣gesting that if there was such rich delight in lessen∣ing the
burden of our fellow creatures's misery alone, how exquisitely would the
delight be heigh∣tened <PB N="41" REF="39"/> by sharing that task with the
object of one's af∣fection.</P>
<P>It was in one of those moments that his heart had been
dictating to him in this arrogant style, when Emma stood before him. His
astonishment was excessive. 
<Q REND="inline">'Good God,' said he, 'Emma'—and then
recollecting himself, 'what brought you here?'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'I come Mr. Hazard,' said Emma,
'ambassa∣dress from the court of love, upon busiress of im∣portance,
and I am determined to carry away with me a catagorical answer.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Stay,' said Charles; 'if the investigation
of Sir Sidney's conduct, and my family concerns are, in the smallest degree
to make a part of what you have to say—though I confess I should be
very ungrateful not to give you credit for the best intentions towards
me—I will not hear a single syllable.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Indeed sir,' said Emma, 'I would not
affront you by investigating any such ridiculous subject. APOLLODORUS,
the architect would not yield in opinion to the Emperor ADRIAN, and was put to 
<PB N="42" REF="40"/> death. FAVORINUS however yielded to him in every thing,
for which conduct, being reproved by his friends, he said, 
<Q REND="inline">"Shall not I easily suffer him to be the
most learned and knowing of all men, who commands thirty legions?"</Q> 'Now,
Mr. Gloss may be FAVORINUS as much as he pleases, but I, in spight of all
consequences, shall be APOLLODORUS; for if Sir Sidney commanded three
hundred legions, instead of thirty, I should never subscribe to his
absurd opinionss, whatever may be my fate: so you may be perfectly easy
on that head. My business at present is confined to one subject, and
you will find it necessary, upon the footing I mean to put it, that you
should give a reasonable and decided answer. Void of passion, void of
revenge, void of any thing but what you honestly and truly feel, nor do I
wish to humble you, or make you deviate from your pride, which I declare is
the truest I ever read of. I look upon you, for your years, as a prodigy.
Your fair, chaste, penetrating understanding is remarkable, and though any
one may see your great aptness for predelection and first-sight
prepossession, yet, when once deceived—till when you cannot have
the meanness to harbour suspicion—decided wa∣riness succeeds to
ill-placed confidence, and I am sure no man will ever deceive you twice. Your
<PB N="43" REF="41"/> first complaisance you think due to the world: your
second to yourself.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Why my dear Emma,' said Charles, 'you speak
with the gravity of an oracle.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'With the truth of one, I know I do,' said
Emma.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'But to what,' returned our hero, 'does all this
tend?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'You shall hear,' said Emma. 'I want to know
how far you will meet me upon the ground of a union with Annette?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'It is impossible,' said Charles.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Do you love her?' returned Emma.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Come, come,' said Charles, 'I see your
drist. If I tenderly loved Annette, there would be no∣thing but I ought to
sacrifice for her; nay there could be no attention however arduous, no
affec∣tion however violent, sincere, and unalterable, in the remotest
degree comparable to her deserts.—Her duty to her father is the first
sentiment of her soul. At the feet of this duty I ought to lay down that
victory which my honour well fought for, and won. If I love her, I sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, I ought to do all this: but I will
speak plain. I cannot shrink into no∣thing, Emma. The first and dearest
wish of my heart—should my father's grief fatally prevail—was
to find a father in Sir Sidney; but, thanks to his sincerity—which was
rather of the rudest—the same line that told me I had lost my
father, <PB N="44" REF="42"/> that I might not flatter myself with any thing
that might console me, told me also that I had lost my friend!'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'My dear sir,' said Emma, 'I want none of
these arguments to believe that your resolution is laudably taken, or that
it ought to be unbroken. I want only this, that you will not estrange
your∣self from a subject that once gave you the dearest pleasure; but
so far keep your heart free, that should the veil that at present hides
your truth and innocence from Sir Sidney be withdrawn, not by your contrivance,
but by his own conviction, through the evidence of his senses, you will, in
such case, agree to that reconciliation which he shall
propose.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Agree!' said Charles, 'I am more hurt for Sir
Sidney than for myself: for of him I am ashamed.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'And I too,' said Emma.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'But to manifest,' said Charles, 'that I
only stickle for a just punctilio, sacredly due to my honour—and
the more as I am my own protector, as I am the general and the army that must
fight the battle alone—if I were assured that Sir Sidney would
believe me an in∣jured man, upon my own single word and honour, I would take
him by the hand to-morrow, and esteem that moment the happiest of my
life.'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="43"/> 
<Q REND="inline">'That he will not then,' said Emma; 'therefore
it is a folly to talk. I know however that in time he will do more: for he can
be just, and he will then believe he has wronged you. My business relates
to what is to be done in the interim.—You will one day or other have
justice, and the farther it is put off the more complete it will be. In the
mean while, will you keep a hope in your heart that Annette may be
yours.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Emma,' said Charles, 'it is a joke to talk in
this manner: the matter should be one thing or the other.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'It cannot,' said Emma. 'There is a certainty
that every thing will be right, but it is as certain that every thing is wrong
at present. The only thing I am now certain of is that Annette loves
you.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Loves me!' said Charles.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Tenderly, ardent∣ly, gratefully loves you,'
said Emma. 'Nay sir, if you will have a heroic propriety in your conduct,
so will we in ours. We will be proud, like you! We will hide what we feel,
like you! We will be unhappy, like you! Nay, if you provoke us, we will go into
a consumption!'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Like who?' cried Charles.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Like you,' answered Emma.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="44"/> 
<Q REND="inline">'Nay,' said Charles, 'can my Annette love me
so dearly?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'She does,' said Emma; 'I am her
ambassadress, and my instructions are to tell you so.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Then take your catagorical answer,' said
Charles. 'Tell her that when I saw her at Aix la Chapelle, every resolution
I had formed before left me. I was from that moment her's uncondi∣tionally; and
this induced me to retire; for if I had not, I should, the next morning, have
fallen at the feet of Sir Sidney.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'I am very glad you did retire,' said Emma,
'for the breach would, by that means, have been so widened, that you could
never have been friends. As it is—'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'As it is,' said Charles, interrupting her,
'let her rule my fate: I will do whatever she com∣mands.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Her commands then,' said Emma, 'will be that
you continue to love her, and write to her under cover to me. In every other
respect do not bait an inch of the conduct you have laid down for
yourself.'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="45"/> This proposal was so consonant to our
hero's sen∣timents, that he accepted it with delight. In short, the
preliminaries were adjusted and agreed to, and Emma marched off in triumph,
with the ratifica∣tion of her treaty.</P>
<P>Though Emma was well contented with her ne∣gociation, yet her
tongue itched to enter upon an∣other subject; but she knew too well with
whom she had to deal, to let her curiosity get the better of her prudence.
It was this: she had heard—nay she knew it beyond doubt, or nothing
could have induced her to believe it—that our hero kept a mis∣tress,
that he had a private lodging for her, and vi∣sited her as often as his
leisure permitted.</P>
<P>This indeed was true; and though she thought nothing of now
and then a random intrigue, in a young man, yet an engagement of this kind
might, especially as he was surrounded with enemies, prove of dangerous
consequence to his interest in An∣nette.</P>
<P>This fact, as a historian of veracity, I am obliged to admit.
Charles certainly in his commerce with women of indifferent reputation—to
which his youth and the warmth of his constitution too much 
<PB N="48" REF="46"/> addicted him—had met with one who had some∣thing
more decent in her manners than the rest, and, upon her promise to detach
herself from her abandoned companions, he had made her comfort∣able at that
time, and intended afterwards to pro∣vide for her.</P>
<P>It was impossible for Charles to have the least de∣gree of
intimacy with any person, and not be at∣tached to their interest. This girl
had many at∣tractions, which her lover was not insensible of. Nay his word
might have been deeply engaged, had not her levity checked his hand. As it was,
he stood engaged in an intercourse pleasureable enough, and which he
could put an end to when he pleased, without a breach of honour.</P>
<P>The moment therefore Emma went away, this he determined to do,
for he swore that Annette should in future engross all his amorous
thoughts. He called immediately at the lodgings of Miss New∣ton, where,
without ceremony, he entered the bed∣chamber; but what was his astonishment
when, in so doing, he saw her in bed, at twelve o'clock at noon, with the
waiter of a bagnio.</P>
<P>Charles made the gentleman jump up, very coolly 
<PB N="49" REF="47"/> kicked him down stairs, and threw his clothes after him.
This done, he waited on the lady, who would first have brazened the matter
out, but finding he was absolutely bent on parting with her, she
dis∣solved into tears;</P>
<P>Seizing this opportunity, he said he did not chuse to be
made a dupe of; that he had conceived the comforts she had tasted would
have made her better consider her own interest; but he plainly saw that
she could relish no pleasures that were not tainted with vicious
ingratitude. He should not however upbraid her: perhaps he himself had been
to blame, in supposing that one so utterly abandoned should retain a
spark of shame or decency.</P>
<P>He added, that her furniture, watch, and indeed all he had given
her—which was no trifle—she might keep: to this he should now
add a hundred pounds, which he hoped she would make a good use of.</P>
<P>The lady attempted at a reply, but fell into hys∣terics, at
which our hero recommen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er to the maid, and walked off;
saying he should send a person the next day to supply Miss Newton
with <PB N="50" REF="48"/> some money he intended her, as she was not then,
in a condition to receive it.</P>
<P>The lady, when she came to herself, and under∣stood her
lover was gone, and, what was worse, without leaving the hundred pounds,
stampt, raved, sighed, swore, danced, laughed, and sobbed, all in a
breath, and after playing fifty curious passionate antics—which she
concluded by fairly kicking Betty out of the room, because she had not the
precau∣tion to shut the door, and so prevent the discovery—she
breathed nothing but revenge and defiance.</P>
<P>Mr. Gloss had been among the number of this lady's admirers
and had actually conferred on Charles a favour equally complaisant with that
of the waiter before mentioned.</P>
<P>From this same Mr. Gloss had Emma, at second hand,
received her information, backed with such circumstances as it was
impossible she could dis∣believe.</P>
<P>Thus was our hero slandered for an attempt to d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tach
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> abandoned woman from her evil
life, by the very man who not only shared her crime, but the wages of her
iniquity; for Mr. Gloss, with all <PB N="51" REF="49"/> his aversion to
Charles, scrupled not to partake of his bounty—as Mistress Dye has
it—at second hand.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER II.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>FULL OF INEFFECTUAL BENEVOLENCE.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>HAVING seen in what state were Charles's plea∣sures, I
shall now look after his affairs. It has been already said that had fortune
made him very rich, he would, through the influence of his own proper
philanthropy, certainly have given the poor and oppressed worthy cause to
bless him, and have been a MACAENAS, nay a little AUGUSTUS, in the opinion of
many neglected men of abilities. But this good will towards men failed, as we
have also said, for want of a certain ingredient in that sort of work,
called the means. He therefore tried whe∣ther, by lifting himself into power,
he could not put himself into cash, and thus accomplish what he had so
set his heart upon. In this also he was as much to seek; and what now
could he do? Why resolve to embark the small remains of his fortune in the
most feasible way that presented itself, mak∣ing general benevolence
the outline of his con∣duct.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="51"/> First he purchased a share in a place
of public amusement, which was coming to the very mart where genius was the
traffic. With what delight did he contemplate the pleasure he should
receive in taking neglected merit by the hand, and patro∣nizing those
productions which the modest timidity of their author kept from the public
because he had no patron! How rejoice when he should rescue music from
boorish barbarism, and reconcile it to reason and nature!—when the
heart should receive no impression but through the ear; and when the
sensations of the soul should fix the criterion of sound! How be
charmed when theatrical painting, instead of monstrous, should be
natural!</P>
<P>None of these desirable ends, however, was he fortunate
enough to attain. He found his partners too refractory, and too much attached
to their own ignorant and conceited measures to listen to him, who was but
an inconsiderable member among them. Vainly did he represent that English
amuse∣ments, were they thrown into a right channel, might very easily be
made, with alternate and never-ending variety, to charm, expand, unbend,
instruct, improve the mind; and, in short, disperse a most
extensive and valuable fund of entertainment, rich, delightful, and
exhilirating, as well as sensible, use∣ful, and moral. Vainly did he
shew this source, <PB N="54" REF="52"/> this mine: they, poor creatures,
were strangers to its value. To speak plainer, they knew of no merit which
came not to them through the medium of flattery, or was not generated in their
own dullness, and foisted on the town by ostensible blockheads, who
estimated their works by the quantity of ma∣nual labour.</P>
<P>Not content with this, our hero visited several gentlemen of
undoubted and undeniable genius, to whom he lamented the great want of their
public exertions, and entreated the advantage of their as∣sistance.
These he found had long retired in dis∣gust: impossible to bear the
affronts and humilia∣tions they had sustained from men to whom—though
unable to judge of any thing worthy public notice—they must implicitly
submit, or retire; while supercilious coxcombs in science, only by dint
of cringing and patronage, were to set the pattern which the enlightened were
to follow.</P>
<P>Not to dwell longer at present on a matter self-evident to
every man of sense in the kingdom but our hero, he found, greatly to his
disappointment, that if he had wished to commit to destruction every
trait of real merit, he had hit upon the very way of all others to effectuate
his purpose. He therefore—in imitation of those men of genius whose
disgust <PB N="55" REF="53"/> against managers, and pity for themselves
and the degenerate age in which they lived, had been so worthily
excited—soon determined to retire. To do this he farmed out his share
for an annuity, which—finding it would be ill paid—he afterwards
fold for an inconsiderable sum: and thus his failure of raising the glory
of the arts in Great Britain, cost him only about eighteen hundred
pounds!</P>
<P>He was not however dismayed at this. His in∣tentions were the
best in the world; and how could he prevent either the vitiated taste of
the public, or the imposition of its purveyors.</P>
<P>His second scheme was to give a temporary re∣lief—all
he could do—to debtors, during that in∣termediate detention between the
capture and the commitment to prison. He had, as I have noticed, paid a very
nice attention to arrests in the earliest stages. He had come at
instances of men who, by being brutally dragged out of their shops, for a
paltry sum, to a spunging house, and kept there under various illegal
pretences for several days—though ultimately released—had, in
the interim, totally lost their credit, and were never again able to hold up
their heads. He had found that bailiffs, in consequence of such
scandalous practices, and extravagant charges, at their houses, had
realized <PB N="56" REF="54"/> large fortunes; nay he learnt, beyond all
contra∣diction, of one who had, for a great length of time, amassed
annually three thousand pounds, and was sure that some others were not
much behind hand; yet this intolerable expence and shameful disgrace was
nothing to the barbarous want of feeling and diabolical unconcern which
tortured the poor debtor in this legal purgatory.</P>
<P>To remedy this evil, at least in some degree, our hero hit
upon a plan that promised good success. He took the lease of a large
house, had it parti∣tioned into a number of convenient apartments, stored
it with every proper article for his purpose, procured a victualler's
licence, and placed a man in it of whom he had the best opinion, but whom he
obliged to bring a responsible person to be joint security with him to
the sheriff.</P>
<P>To this hotel debtors were, by advertisement, advised to go
the moment they were arrested—for it is then in their power to
insist upon being carried where they please—and there for
one-fourth, per∣haps one-fifth, of that sum for which they would be served
with food and liquor they could neither eat nor drink, and huddled
promiscuously among filth and nastiness without a retreat, unless
perhaps by paying a still more exorbitant price, where they 
<PB N="57" REF="55"/> could consult their friends—they were neatly
ac∣commodated, well served, and, in short, provided with every
pleasurable convenience and humane at∣tention that could at such a moment
be most agree∣able to them. Added to this, an attorney of abili∣ties had a
salary to attend every inmate of that hos∣pitable mansion, with advice
according to each man's different case.</P>
<P>This liberal plan, though it was a little mad and eccentric, in
something less than two years, which time it lasted, saved, in the
aggregate, at least the sum of nineteen thou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>and pounds in hard money to a set of unfortunate men
and their fami∣lies, besides a world of humiliation and disgrace; and, what
was a still greater advantage—by a fair appeal to the humanity of the
creditor, shewing him the impossibility of getting his money by
send∣ing a man to prison, conjuring him to commiserate the sufferings
of his fellow creatures, and other ar∣guments likely to disarm his
anger—at least three hundred of those unfortunate men who would
other∣wise have gone to confinement, and who, it they did not die in it,
might almost as well do so, for their credit would have been totally
lost, and their families reduced to poverty, were given back to society,
mildly warned not to be guilty of future <PB N="58" REF="56"/> indiscretions,
instead of thrown into a situation where strong necessity, in
spight of the best inten∣tions, must have inevitably plunged them into
ten times worse.</P>
<P>Our hero had a particular pleasure in being in∣strumental
towards healing those <HI>meum</HI> and <HI>tuum</HI> breaches. He very often
accompanied the house attorney, and was peculiarly happy with the credi∣tor
in that kind of argument which shewed him that he was like an angry school
boy, throwing one mar∣ble to find another, and at last losing both. In
short, he saw his benevolent institution thrive every day, though it
must be confessed, to keep-up its credit, orders were now and then
obliged to be given, that no notorious swindlers, or other well known
sharpers, might be admitted; and this was pretty well managed by enquiring
whether the deb∣tors brought there were tradesmen, or men of libe∣ral
professions, or members of the church, the army, the court, or of those
other descriptions which would make it probable they were such objects as
the spirit of the plan went to relieve. Yet is it not astonishing that
the world received this spirited in∣novation on official tyranny as a most
unbecoming attempt to destroy the common usuage and sanc∣tioned
progress of the law! It was called a mad scheme, and one that would
finish by converting the <PB N="59" REF="57"/> house into a receptacle for
lunatics, where the founder would be the first person admitted.</P>
<P>One very curious thing that our hero came at through his
researches was that many of these cases originated from the folly, and
frequently something worse, of the creditors themselves. An overgrown
tradesman would coax a neighbour of the same busi∣ness into his debt,
and then arrest him, to destroy his credit, that so the coast might be
left clear for himself. Others would fasten upon minors, whom they would
supply upon long credit with bad goods, at a high price, and then arrest
them the moment they became of age. Many were the instances where
booksellers, music-shops, and picture-dealers had conferred obligations
on those artists who had no medium but theirs through which to give their
works to the world, and who were arrested at the moment their creditor knew
it was impossible to get any thing, merely that they might make over some
valuable work for a trifle.</P>
<P>Charles strenuously exerted himself upon these
occasions; but he generally found the creditor in∣exorable, and the poor
devil o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a debtor obliged to
submit to terms which must still further involve him with his hard
task-master.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="58"/> Our hero saw the folly of persuasion,
and still more of proposing any accommodation through his own means. Indeed
it was out of his power to give way to the dictates of his philanthropy in any
case, which Emma, when she heard of, greatly approved; for she said
that Dean SWIFT, rigid as he was, could not bring his excellent plan of lending
money in small sums to the perfection he wished it, without endangering
his fortune. To which she added, by way of comment, 
<Q REND="inline">'that very few but men of indif∣ferent fortunes
thought liberally, which was a dread∣ful business, since none but those
of ample ones had it in their power to act so.'</Q></P>
<P>Charles nevertheless found means of remitting to the wife or
daughter what a strict attention to the plan demanded from the father, which
was how∣ever always managed so discreetly, that nobody could tell from
whence it came, but by guess. Gra∣titude, however, constantly gave the act
to its right owner, and thus was our hero frequently slandered for his
benevolence; for was it not plain that the person so befriended might have
starved in prison, but for the beauty of his wife or his
daughter?—though, for aught they knew, one might be blind, and the other
deformed.</P>
<P>Charles foresaw that he should incur a good deal 
<PB N="61" REF="59"/> of this slander, and indeed he was obliged to take an
extraordinary step at the outset to avoid the im∣possibility of
carrying on his scheme without the total ruin of his reputation. This was, to
admit no women who were arrested, lest wretches, void of honour, should
be sent there, upon either real or imaginary actions, to the discredit of
the house.—It is true many of these things were attempted, but when
they were peremptorily informed that there was no sort of accommodation, they
soon desisted; and this, as much as any thing, kept away sharpers: for
they can herd only with women of the above description.</P>
<P>Thus was this asylum appropriated, according to its original
institution, to men under misfortune only. It wore a sober, decent
appearance, and in∣stead of riot, extravagance, gambling, and profli∣gacy, it
exhibited a society of people in distress, it is true, but profiting by
each other's advice and as∣sistance. Women of credit and reputation were
not ashamed to be seen there, and the consolation of near and tender
relations was never interrupted by rude and brutal intimidations; nor was any
opportunity ever lost of cheering the wretched, and softening the
sufferings of the unfortunate.</P>
<P>In the mean time a number of unpleasant at∣tempts 
<PB N="62" REF="60"/> were made to destroy this desirable asylum for the
afflicted. Bailiffs make fortunes in two ways; by either carrying a man to
their houses, and so spunging upon him till he is drained of all his
money, or else by taking a compliment, as they call it, in proportion to the
sum for which he is ar∣rested, and then taking his word: that is to say,
letting him go. Now it happened that our hero's plan so trenched upon this
first method, that they were obliged, oftener than had been their custom,
to have recourse to the second. Thus, being obliged to trade upon an
unusual risk, several of them, who did not properly know their men, came
into scrapes, and nothing among them was talked of but motions of court,
suspensions, and other unseasonable mat∣ters, which made them look
about them in earnest; for they plainly saw that if Charles's asylum was
found to be of public utility, and taken up upon a larger plan, bailiffs might
even return to their for∣mer vocations of knights of the post, bullies to
bawdy houses, thief-takers, and runners to gaols.</P>
<P>With a number of such low enemies against him, no wonder if
our hero met with a thousand insults. It will not however be so
necessary for me to spin out trifling matters, as to enumerate them. He
never failed to put the law severely in force against them, whenever they
infringed their duty; and as to any <PB N="63" REF="61"/> thing else, he held
it beneath him to notice it.—But now a matter of serious consequence
indeed happened to him. He was one evening arrested for three thousand
pounds. Supposing this some manoeuvre that he could easily get rid of to
the confusion of the tribe of the catch poles, he insisted upon going to
his own house of security, but this favour was peremptorily denied him,
with an in∣formation that the officer who kept it was sus∣pended; for that
he had connived at the escape of a person who had been confined there for a
debt of three thousand pounds, that the sheriff had been fixed for the
debt, and now came upon him as one of the securities.</P>
<P>In short, the fellow who had so long kept his credit with
our hero, in the execution of his trust as sheriff's officer—a
post, as we have seen, that may be filled with reputation—after
having been a long time tampered with, and yet resisting every temptation,
was at last overcome.</P>
<P>A swindler owed virtually to one man a thou∣sand pounds, but
literally three thousand. The cir∣cumstance is worth attending to. This one
man was a rascally attorney, found out by a set of as ras∣cally bailiffs,
who were determined to knock up <PB N="64" REF="62"/> Charles's plan. He sent
for the swindler, asked him the amount of all his debts, and was informed
they were something more than three thousand pounds. He was then desired
to inform himself whether they could not be paid with a thousand..</P>
<P>This enquiry was made, and it was found they could; for he had
no creditor but would be glad to take a third for the whole, seeing they
stood no other chance of getting any.</P>
<P>Before any further step was taken, the security of Charles's
factotum was tampered with—at first distantly—who appearing not
very shy, as they called it, was at length plainly informed how he might
touch a thousand pounds. In short, finding him apt, they proposed, if he
could prevail on the officer to connive at an escape, they should receive a
thousand pounds each. The affairs of the security were going down, and he
had no doubt but he should induce his friend to consent. In short, the
scruples of both were at length overcome.</P>
<P>This being accomplished, the swindler's debts were paid with
a thousand pounds, the attorney re∣ceived documents which made him appear to
stand in the shoes of the creditors to the amount of three 
<PB N="65" REF="63"/> thousand pounds. For this sum was the swindler
arrested; for this sum was the sheriff fixed, in con∣sequence of his
escape; and for this sum—after the factotum and his security were
paid their money, and fairly put into a post chaise—was our hero four
days in custody: at the end of which time, rather inconveniently, he paid the
money, and procured his enlargement.</P>
<P>Thus did the attorney, who was ostensible for the bailiffs,
receive the original money they had ad∣vanced, bribe their agent with double
that sum, procure the swindler's liberty, and all at Charles's
expence;—who now saw it would be utterly impos∣sible for him to
carry his humane plan any far∣ther.</P>
<P>Bigoted however to his project, and having seen the best
effects from it, he waited on men of larger fortune, with a view to advise
with them how to perfect an undertaking of such material utility.—He
exposed the conduct of it with the minutest nicety, and shewed how much
money, as well as happiness, he had been the instrument of restoring to
his fellow creatures in distress.</P>
<P>Unfortunately he was disappointed in every
ap∣plication!—for <PB N="66" REF="64"/> finding, after a critical
statement of the accounts, that he had at no time made seven per cent. of
his money—indeed he did not make more than four, for he inserted none
of those ex∣pences to be laid to the account of his benefac∣tions—he
could not find a single creature to engage in it.</P>
<P>His last application was to the sheriffs, but their answer
was that they had no notion of putting the business out of the common
channel; and indeed they were no friends to the scheme, for it had in∣jured
the emoluments of their office, by preventing the accumulation of arrests.
Nay they had heard men in power hint that it was an idle, meddling scheme,
and, among other public inconveniences, it had decreased the stamp
duty.</P>
<P>As the limits of our hero's fortune would not permit him to
become security again for a person to manage the house, and as it would
answer no end to let it to a thorough bred sheriff's officer, he was
obliged to drop the affair: lamenting that his circumstances were so
straitened, that he could not carry it to that perfection he wished; and
feeling severely for the dignity of human nature, when he reflected that in
all his researches he had not <PB N="67" REF="65"/> been able to transfer
benevolence upon the easy terms of good pecuniary interest, sweetened
with the benedictions of the unfortunate.</P>

<PB REF="66"/>
<HEAD>CHAPTER V.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>MORE SCHEMING UPON A SANDY FOUNDATION, AN UNJUST TRIAL AND
CONVICTION, AND ONE EXULTATION QUASHED BY ANOTHER.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THAT I may carry our hero the whole length of his tether while I
am about it, I shall proced to plan the third, though it must be observed
that these schemes were all in agitation at once: so full of vivacity
were his actions when he panted to succour his fellow creatures.</P>
<P>This third scheme went to the relief of the poor at large, and
indeed so did the fourth. One was a plan to sell them bread under the
standard price, and the other meat.</P>
<P>To carry the first into execution, a water-mill was built, and
a bakehouse annexed to it. The matter was found very practicable; the
original money yielded at least six per cent. and the poor, even then, were
served with better bread, and saved <PB N="69" REF="67"/> at least a penny
out of every sixpence. Nothing could be more simple, nor more effective.
The sparring of the bakers was more easily kept within bounds than that of
the bailiffs. Indeed, as our hero meant to make his expences the ground of a
memorial for the better regulation of so material an article, his competitors
were rather inclined to con∣ciliate than aggravate matters.</P>
<P>The scheme for regulating the price of meat could not be
conducted in a manner so within himself as the other. He therefore could
not avoid connecting himself with a grazier and a butcher. In the choice of
these he used every precaution his most watchful and diligent prudence
could suggest.</P>
<P>At length, having settled the matter to his mind, the plan was
began and carried on, for some time, with astonishing success, though
he could not re∣strain his partners from making more interest for their
money than he wished: yet, with these and many other clogs upon it, the
advantages to the poor were considerable. The forestallers however at
last so harassed and inconvenienced the concern, that in about seven
weeks after the hospitable asy∣lum was put down, our hero had the
mortification to see his name in the Gazette, as partner of Daniel 
<PB N="70" REF="68"/> Driver and Anthony Garbage, graziers, butchers, dealers
and chapmen.</P>
<P>We have seen the young gentleman in a state of
astonishment before; how he felt at this intelligence we can the readier
conceive. But still his situation varied a little from the rest. He never
saw himself before upon the brink of poverty. However, after the first
shock, he received great consolation from the consciousness of his
own good intentions, and he contented himself with only adding to the first
transport of his indignation—which was pretty vio∣lent—that men
were wolves and vultures, and that the greatest act of madness a man could
be guilty of, was an attempt to civilize them.</P>
<P>The first step he took was an endeavour to super∣sede
the bankruptcy, as far as related to himself; upon a plea that he was able to
satisfy his own cre∣ditors, by paying twenty shillings in the pound.</P>
<P>Poor, inexperienced young man! He little knew that was the
worst plea he could offer. It availed him nothing. His effects were
overhauled, his mill was sold, and, after obtaining his certificate in form,
he found himself possessed of no more than between three and four
hundred pounds.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="69"/> Thus were overthrown all our projector's
hopes! which, though they certainly were a system of re∣form utterly beyond
his ability to mature, yet he surely merited no reproach for having made
such a laudable attempt.</P>
<P>As I have already observed, there never was per∣haps an
instance of a well-disposed young man who was in so trying a way let
alone entirely to the bent of his own disposition. That disposition
evidently led him to alleviate the wants of his fellow crea∣tures. If in this
he aimed at more than he could accomplish, let it be attributed to a liberal,
ex∣panded propensity to confer benefits; a noble, giv∣ing, beneficent
principle of action, which must be endowed in an uncommon degree with
courageous generosity, to risk, in supplying the wants of others, the
existence of that source from which those wants were supplied.</P>
<P>As to the vehicles through which this benevolence was
dispensed, they certainly wanted riper experi∣ence, more consequence, and
a larger fund to ma∣nage them; for, as it was, our hero's
conduct—especially as to his two first schemes—was a sort
of Quixotism in liberality. But yet, had the folly been ten times more
egregious, it was still but folly; whereas the intention in so young a man,
so <PB N="72" REF="70"/> unadvised, so left to his own propensities,
requires a word to express its deserts much stronger than any dictionary
will give us, and which one might have an idea of by fancying—if one
could do so without violating language—something that implied a
mean∣ing about ten times as expressive as the superlative degree of
admirable.</P>
<P>Nine out of ten however reviled Charles's con∣duct in the most
humiliating terms. He had a hundred nick names. He was the infant Her∣cules;
the mad projector; the opulent beggar; the beneficent catchpole; Timon in
tatters; and ninety-five other things, all as good as these. But in the
midst of this, it must have mortified his ene∣mies to death, and raised
the praise of all good men to that very unspeakable degree of admiration I
mentioned in the last paragraph, had they accom∣panied the gradual decline of
his circumstances with remarks on his becoming conduct, and then seen how
he sat himself down in adversity!</P>
<P>When first he returned to England, he had an elegant house,
and kept his carriage. The moment he was out of parliament, he sold off his
carriage, took a smaller house, and lived more privately; till, step by
step, we now see him only decently lodged, with an old gentlewoman, who had
been <PB N="73" REF="71"/> his housekeeper, for his only attendant. Yet did
every sixpence of those superfluities he curtailed go to relieve the
distressed; for it was his constant method to retreat in time, that
so nothing might be spared to accomplish his great and liberal
pur∣poses.</P>
<P>There is something also beautiful, and I hope it so
strikes the reader, in reflecting that when Charles was driven to the
necessity of discarding all his servants but one, he should retain
the oldest and most helpless among the number; and, to finish this
picture, if it has so far interested the reader, let it melt him into
friendly generous sympathy, when I heighten it by bringing on a grateful
honest group of now happy objects, through the means of his beneficence,
lamenting the state to which alone his compassionate generosity had
reduced him; vent∣ing their admiration of a mind so charitable, yet so
young; invoking benedictions on his head, for the benefits they had
themselves, through him, and from his hands, received; and conjuring him to
accept their thankful mite, for his present assistance.</P>
<P>I can only say that no glutton ever sat down to a banquet
with half the satisfaction that Charles felt at this sight. He thanked them
with tears; assured <PB N="74" REF="72"/> them that his situation was a
trifling concern, since it had mended theirs; that he had resources, and
so little repented of what had past, that had he again fifteen thousand
pounds, he would give it with pleasure to have the charming satisfaction of
enjoying such another moment.</P>
<P>During all this time our hero's correspondence with Annette
went on variously. Sometimes Emma was obliged to be extremely cautious, and,
at other times, all caution was altogether as unnecessary.—This
happened just as Charles rose or sunk in the opinion of Sir Sidney, who
had really—finding him such an original—watched his conduct with
great attention.</P>
<P>In parliament he had remarked that though there was great
singularity in it, there was also great con∣sistency, and, what was
better, great integrity:—and much about the time when Emma adjusted the
correspondence between the lovers, was really in∣clined to think that he had
been wronged, or that he had the strangest mixture of good and ill
quali∣ties in him that ever was heard of, when Mr. Gloss contrived, while Sir
Sidney's sentiments were in this equipoise, to make our hero's virtues kick
the beam with a single fillup.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="73"/> In short, he had then, as usual, an
opportunity of turning one of his good actions into the appear∣ance of a very
bad one, and he had no doubt but, by this means, he should be able to make
the ba∣ronet's dubious thoughts preponderate on the side that would be
least to Charles's advantage.</P>
<P>Gloss took the very first opportunity that he heard Sir
Sidney say any thing tending to Charles's praise of remarking that good men
were always the most easy to be imposed upon; and in this he said very
true, for he was then going to impose upon Sir Sid∣ney. He followed this
declaration up with ano∣ther, expressing his great reluctance that it
should fall to his lot to bring forward accusations conti∣nually against
Mr. Hazard, and, in particular, lest the censorious world—for he was
sure Sir Sidney would do him more justice—should think he had a
farther interest in such conduct than mere impar∣tial justice, and a
desire that a gentleman so dear to him, and indeed to the world in general,
should undeceive himself in an opinion undeservedly enter∣tained of one
who not only plunged himself every day into some fresh vice, but indeed
seemed to set shame and even decency at defiance. He insisted that
benevolence extended to bad objects was a sort of crime; it was a tacit
admission, though not approval, of their conduct; and might, in men to 
<PB N="76" REF="74"/> whom the world looked up, as it did to Sir Sidney for
example, be so construed. He took the liberty to add, that if his dear
friend had a foible—though to be sure it was amiable in the
extreme—this was it.</P>
<P>In short, after a proper dose of gilded flattery, he
informed the baronet that it was then a week since our hero had turned a poor
wretch, whom he had seduced from her friends, into the streets, with all
the shocking circumstances of shame and wretchedness. The way he came
to the truth of this was, the miserable creature, hearing he was one of Mr.
Hazard's friends, had called upon him, and related the whole shocking
business with such simplicity and apparent truth, that he had been
in∣duced to relieve her, and intended visiting her fa∣ther, to try if he
could not prevail on him to re∣ceive his repentant child into the bosom of
her fa∣mily.</P>
<P>Sir Sidney seemed greatly shocked with this story, and,
upon Mr. Gloss's repeated entreaty, consented not only to see this
unhappy girl, but to use his interest with her father, who was, it seems,
a substantial tradesman, to take her back again.</P>
<P>Not to let the matter cool, the baronet saw the 
<PB N="77" REF="75"/> young lady, was afterwards introduced to a person who
kept wine vaults in Petty France, who con∣fessed himself her father, and
had the good fortune, after using a variety of arguments, first to prevail
on him to see, and afterwards forgive, the reclaimed sinner; to whom Sir
Sidney presented one fifty pounds, and Mr. Gloss another, accon panied with
good counsel, in some men's estimation, to fifty times that value.</P>
<P>The story the young lady told Sir Sidney, was briefly this:
that Charles had taken uncommon pains to seduce her, but being tired with
possession, had now turned her off: that she verily believed, dearly
as she loved him, and ever should, his prin∣cipal motive in a connection
with her was interest. This the gentleman in Petty France believed too; for
he assured Sir Sidney that when she went off she carried two hundred
pounds with her. But, the lady said, had he found his account in this
expec∣tation, she did not think she should have kept him long, for she
soon found that he had fallen in love with a girl whose mother he had taken
out of a spunging house; and this she said was so true, that the
mother lived with him at that time, in quality of housekeeper, and the
daughter was put out to a milliner, in a house where she was to be taken in
<PB N="78" REF="76"/> partnership, when her apprenticeship should be
ex∣pired.</P>
<P>Many circumstances were adduced to prove the truth of these
allegations, and as far as it related to our hero's protestations, though
they were but in general terms, there was enough under his hand∣writing, which
Sir Sidney knew, to corroborate his connection with her, and parting from her,
par∣ticularly the latter, in which the baronet thought he discovered a
remarkable vein of cruel and in∣sulting levity.</P>
<P>I believe it is scarcely necessary to add that the lady
was Miss Newton; that she had been tutored by Gloss; that the man at the
wine vaults was oc∣casionally a convenient friend of hers; that these two
divided Sir Sidney's bounty, and gave Gloss's back again. This admitted, our
hero's letters will not appear extraordinary, especially the last, at which
the baronet was so incensed, which accom∣panied the hundred pounds he
sent her the day af∣ter he had detected her; and as it happened, ac∣cording
to the partial construction now put upon it, to apply so directly in favour
of the lady, by exhibiting a want of feeling in the gentleman, I shall here
insert it.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="77"/> The reader will keep in mind that the
gentle∣man's name was Nantz who kept the wine vaults.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>The reader, who is with me in the secret, will find this
letter quite delicate. It laughs off a very great injury; it is, besides, in
a style well adapted to the person to whom it is addressed; and there
is something very delicate in the circumstance of taking no notice of what
it enclosed. We however must commend Sir Sidney, and had we been, as he
was, ignorant of the real truth, we should have thought as he did.</P>
<P>It must be confessed that, in spight of Gloss's
moderation, Sir Sidney exulted a little at this story. <PB N="80" REF="78"/>
He came home full of it, and as he had seen Charles's hand-writing, and
besides nobody could think of doubting his veracity, even Emma herself was,
for the present, unprepared, or at least ap∣peared so, to defend her
favourite, which indeed vexed her not a little; because she had just got
the correspondence in such a nice train. She contented herself therefore
with saying, that it had been said there were two ALEXANDERS; one
invincible, the son of PHILIP; the other inimitable, the production of
APELLES. At present it might be said there were two Mr. Hazards: one good
and benevolent, represented by the world; the other vile and diabo∣lical,
painted by Mr. Gloss. That for her part, she did not approve of premature
condemnations: they were generally repented of. They had not yet heard both
sides of the question, except in one instance, where Mr. Hazard was
cleared greatly to his honour. She said she should not have scrupled to
disbelieve the whole of this business, but for the circumstance of the
letters. With that proof she should rest contented; for Sir Sidney had
the evi∣dence of his own senses to go upon. She wished most truly he
would never credit any thing but through that medium.</P>
<P>She allowed the young gentleman had failings, nor was it to be
wondered at. TELEMACHUS, though <PB N="81" REF="79"/> with Minerva for his
guide, fell into the errors of his father. What must this young man do,
help∣less and alone?—who never had occasion for his friends till he
had lost them:—and how lost them? It was not then a moment to
investigate that. She should therefore say she acquiesced in the
truth of our hero's faults, but it should be upon this condi∣tion, that if he
had weakness, it was the weakness of an angel.</P>
<P>Sir Sidney begged she would retain her good opi∣nion of Mr.
Hazard: it was perfectly consistent with her romantic notions: but
desired she would not so far make a novel of the business, as to let
her friendship interfere with her duty.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Sir,' said Emma, 'if to have your interest
ten∣derly at heart be to neglect my duty, no duty was ever so
neglected.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Come, come,' said Gloss, 'you need not
vaunt your fidelity, Mrs. Emma, till it is disputed:—we see what you
are.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'It is easily seen,' answered Emma, very
mildly, 'what I am, and it will one day sir be seen what you are,
and—Mr. Gloss—WHO you are.'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="80"/> Sir Sidney would certainly have rebuked
Emma very sharply for this strange freedom, but that he saw, at the
instant it was uttered, the strongest marks of confusion in the
countenance of Gloss.—These, to be sure, he endeavoured to pass
off, by hinting that the liberty Mrs. Emma had taken was very extraordinary:
but this he did so slightly—fearing probably a few more of those
choke pears—that the baronet was assured so significant an
expres∣sion would not have been levelled by Emma, or received by him in the
manner it had, were there not something of an extraordinary nature couched
under it. He thought however the wisest way at present would be to break
up the conversation. He therefore told Emma he was assured she had the
best intentions, and begged Mr. Gloss would forgive her, if any thing she
had said in her haste offended him.</P>
<P>Gloss took him at his word with great eagerness, totally
unlike himself, and this augmented Sir Sid∣ney's suspicions.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER VI.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>CONTAINS, AMONG OTHER MATTER, A HISTORY WHICH THE READER WILL
NOT IMMEDIATELY SEE THE DRIFT OF.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>Now it happened that had Emma found it con∣venient she could
have consuted the whole of this calumny, and in a way greatly to our hero's
honour; but this would have brought up matters which, in spight of all her
diligence, were not yet ripe enough for investigation. The fact is that she
had made herself not a little uneasy at this very circum∣stance before,
which she had first learnt through some invidious intimations from
Gloss, and had very carefully watched the matter, till at length her fears
were at an end upon our hero's leaving Miss New∣ton, owing, she had no
doubt, to the more agree∣able commerce in which she had now engaged him; and
this roused in her a reflection greatly to his credit; for if the bare
mention of a correspondence with a woman of honour could induce such a
youth to give up a guilty connection unsolicited, what might not have been
expected from him had his <PB N="84" REF="82"/> other pursuits been
sanctioned by the advice of sensi∣ble and respectable friends. And yet
prudence had whispered to Emma that it was certainly, but yet barely,
possible for Charles to have given up Miss Newton in compliment to his
housekeeper's daugh∣ter. This business, therefore, she made a point of
coming at; to do which, she visited the old lady one day when our hero, as
she knew, was engaged at his mill, about five miles out of town.</P>
<P>There was something in this old lady that had be∣fore
strongly prepossessed Emma in her favour, and as the latter came not
out of any improper curio∣sity, to make an advantage of any thing she
should hear to the other's disadvantage, and as the former had never made a
secret of the story, but, on the contrary, though against our hero's
will, taken every opportunity of singing forth his praises, by repeating
the circumstances of it as far as he had been concerned in it, to every one
who asked it, it will not either surprise the reader to hear that Emma
got out of the old gentlewoman the particu∣lars of her whole life, or that when
she had done so, she admired the extraordinary goodness of Charles more
than ever:—and here the reader will reflect with double pleasure that
this was the very domestic, or rather companion, he retained in his
circum∣stances of adverse fortune.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="83"/> The old lady having first, like Othello,
told her story in parcels, Emma begged to have it from her youth up: the
which to hear did she most seriously incline. What she told at
length, I shall give the reader briefly; for I have no time for spinning
out narratives.</P>
<P>She was the daughter of a gentleman, who had a life place in a
public office, and had been thrown very early in life, with a small fortune,
into the protection of an aunt, who unfortunately being a woman of intrigue,
connived at her ruin. Her se∣ducer, by whom she had a child, was a
clergyman; but as he soon left her, she was compassionated by another
relation, who took her home, obliged the father to take the child, which was a
boy, and got her fortune out of the hands of her aunt.</P>
<P>It was not many months before a respectable tradesman paid
his addresses to her, and, in spight of her misfortune, offered her his
hand; nay, he was the warmer on that account. He knew she had been betrayed
by a wicked woman and a sinner in the garb of a saint, and therefore wanted
a pro∣tector. In short, they became man and wife, and had lived in great
credit five-and-twenty years, when falling into difficulties, through the
villany of some notorious swindlers, and innocently getting 
<PB N="86" REF="84"/> the ill will of a pettifogging attorney, her husband,
whose name was Marlow, was one of those whose reputation had been totally
ruined by vexatious arrests, in the way I have already described.</P>
<P>Our hero strenuously exerted himself in the poor man's
behalf, and with great difficulty—but not till all his connections,
scared by this temporary misfortune, had deserted him—obtained his
liberty from a spunging house, where he laid thirteen days in a most
cheerless condition, during which time he was witness to the riotous
profligacy of some of those very men who had wilfully caused his
misfortunes.</P>
<P>The loss of his credit, added to a severe cold he had caught
by lying in a damp bed, threw him into a fever, which, in spight of every
caution, hurried him out of the world in a very short time. He died
recommending his widow and her daughter to the protection of our hero, now the
only friend he had in the world.</P>
<P>The old lady, as it has been shewn, was appointed Charles's
housekeeper, and the young one, who was the only remaining child out of
eleven, was put into business exactly in the manner Mr. Gloss re∣lated,
who always made it a rule to keep truth as <PB N="87" REF="85"/> much in view as
he conveniently could in all his stories.</P>
<P>This was the account that Emma, had she found it expedient,
might have opposed to the other; to which also she was prepared to add,
that so far from his having seduced Miss Newton, she was not only a
notoriously abandoned character, but that Mr. Gloss knew it. She contented
herself however with the few hints she had given, which she was pleased
to find had told just as she wished they should.</P>
<P>If Emma was however satisfied for the present, I cannot
say so much for Sir Sidney, who, the first time he was alone with his
lady, asked her freely her sentiments on this subject, and, in
particular, how she could account for the freedom of Emma's conduct.</P>
<P>Lady Roebuck said he might be assured there was not in
existence a more faithful creature; that, however, no duty could induce her
to be what she conceived ungrateful, or unjust; that she had cer∣tainly
the highest opinion of Mr. Hazard, and had set her heart upon his union
with Annette; but that as his fortune daily diminished, and the pretensions
of Mr. Gloss were daily more and more established, <PB N="88" REF="86"/>
she trembled for her favourite, of whom she would not credit any ill, till
every thing could be estab∣lished by a fair investigation; which, for her
own part, seeing neither side was willing to make the first motion, she
thought would never take place.</P>
<P>One great proof, Lady Roebuck said, both of the attachment of
Emma, and the delicacy of those sentiments by which she supported it,
was, that though her predelection in favour of Mr. Hazard was evident, yet
she had never used any unbecom∣ing arguments to Annette on the subject;
but, con∣trary to this, had always held out that the com∣mands of her
father—which only urged her to make an effort to overcome that affection
which to be sure the whole family had formerly sanctioned—were very
lenient, and truly characteristic of the charming mind of a parent, who had,
upon every occasion, been remarkable for his indulgence to∣wards his
daughter.</P>
<P>In this however Lady Roebuck neither told nor knew the truth;
for Emma privately kept up her affection for Charles, and increased her
aversion to Gloss.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'But,' said Sir Sidney, 'what meant that
strange side accusation of Mr. Gloss? What did she mean 
<PB N="89" REF="87"/> by saying it would be known who he was? Had I not been
averse to lower the consequence of a gentleman before a dependant, I would
have in∣sisted on an explanation of that expression.'</Q></P>
<P>Lady Roebuck went on in these words. 
<Q REND="inline">'My dear Sir Sidney, you know with what
reluctance I have ever ventured to say a word on this subject. I own I have
been myself greatly prepossessed in favour of Mr. Hazard. We all, at
one time, es∣teemed him as a most amiable young man, and though we have had
what has been thought strong proofs against him, yet, as Emma says, only
one side of the question has been heard, and I confess, from some
internal impulse, which may per∣haps be the effect of my sanguine wishes
for this young gentleman's welfare—which wishes were inspired by the
dying and pathetic request of his mother, for whom we had all a tender
friend∣ship—I cannot yet consent to pronounce him, from my own
conviction, guilty of such very enormous offences, which could not be
perpe∣trated but by a mind capable of the most hardened and incorrigible
wickedness: a disposition which is rarely produced suddenly, and of
which his, by what we have seen of it, promised exactly the
reverse.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="88"/> 
<Q REND="inline">'While I say this however, continued Lady
Roe∣buck, 'I will not contend how far these feelings are right. They may be
falsely entertained, perhaps, impelled by the motives I have men∣tioned,
while your riper judgment and better know∣ledge of the world have enabled you
to form a truer and more decided opinion of the truth; in which case it would
be strange vanity, however right my intentions, in entertaining these
senti∣ments, if I did not, as upon all other occasions, implicitly submit
to yours.'</Q></P>
<P>Sir Sidney kissed her, perhaps for her obedience; said
she was a charming creature, and desired her to go on.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'As to Annette,' added Lady Roebuck, 'I shall
there be still more backward to give either advice or opinion, for very many
reasons, necessarily de∣licate; but one is, which is the most
pleasurable, that never was advice to a young, tender, sensible creature
so little needed: she is all you can wish from inclination, or hope from
duty: yet I ho∣nestly believe she regards Mr. Hazard more warmly than any
other person in the world. Not however that her prepossession in his
favour has made her sentiments to Mr. Gloss otherwise than they would
have been had she never seen him. <PB N="91" REF="89"/> She deports
herself, upon all occasions, with that sweet native dignity in which
pure, unaffected loveliness is sure to be seen, and therefore Mr. Gloss
has had no reason to complain of receiving that portion of her favour which
all those com∣mand from her who come sanctioned with the partiality of her
father; but, be assured, that at present he is almost the last
person in the world she wishes to think of as a husband. Yet I will not
say, that were you so far to exert the authority of a father, as to
insist upon her marrying him, she would refuse; for I sincerely
believe she has so singular a sense of implicit duty, that she
would give up her own happiness to promote yours.—This allowed, every
thing remains well: you will never exert so rigorous a duty, and she will
never take any steps to disoblige you.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Upon my soul,' said Sir Sidney, 'it is
impos∣sible to hear you without being charmed: you have so the knack of
smoothing every difficulty. It is not wonderful there should be such
perfection in Annette, when she can look up to you for her example.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'My dear,' answered Lady Roebuck, 'what∣ever
little my assiduity and endeavours have ef∣fected in the blameless and
admirably-regulated <PB N="92" REF="90"/> conduct of your daughter, Emma's care
and at∣tention have performed a great deal more. That good, that
astonishing creature, makes virtue the most endearing thing in the world,
and contrives to give its attractions a winning cheerfulness, that induces
its performance not more as a duty than as a familiar and enchanting
pleasure. Much more yet however is owing to Annette herself, the
sweetness of whose unaffected manners, the gaiety of whose angelic
dsposition, and the un∣sullied purity of whose charming mind,
anticipate every attempt to inspire goodness; for where should we find
virtue but in its abode?'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'All this only convinces me,' said the
baronet, 'that I ought to consider myself the happiest hus∣band and
father in the world. As to Emma, I readily believe her a prodigy of honour and
in∣tegrity. All I have to find fault with is, that she is often
unnecessarily zealous, and that her virtue is now and then a little too
outrageous. One in∣stance of this we have recently seen, and I should be
glad to know if you can possibly give a guess at what she would be at;
for I must confess I have an anxious desire to know, and yet am very
unwilling to resort to her for intelligence: there∣fore, as you saw, I put
an end to the conversa∣tion.'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="91"/> 
<Q REND="inline">'My dear Sir Sidney,' said Lady Roebuck, 'I
own I am not sorry for this opportunity of saying what I think is Emma's
opinion of Mr. Gloss; on the contrary, I shall take the liberty of
follow∣ing it with my own.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Emma thinks Mr. Gloss a man of great talents,
but having discovered in him a specious plausi∣bility, which she says
men of independant cir∣cumstances or principles are never under the
ne∣cessity of having recourse to, she will insist upon it he is not
an eligible match for Annette.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'There is a mystery, an obscurity, in the
very best accounts we have learnt concerning him, that leaves his qualities
with Emma in a very negative situation, and inclines her to think he will,
one day or other, be found an impostor. It has been urged that your
correspondent at Madeira gives him the character of an able man of
business, says he was a merchant first at Lisbon, and afterwards at
Madeira, and that he profusely spent a large fortune. He himself since
says he received a handsome sum on account of his father's affairs, and
that a much larger remains unpaid, but that India matters are slow and
insecure. But Emma opposes to this quaintly, but smartly enough, that
suppose they were fast and certain, would <PB N="94" REF="92"/> they tell
in his favour against his monstrous debts? On account of which, she
insinuates, it was well he secured himself a seat in parliament. At the
same time, she does not deny but his external con∣duct is perfectly
blameless, and that he has openly a number of engaging and valuable
qualities; but she suspects that half these are put on, and accounts
for this suspicion under an idea that it is his study to render himself
agreeable by adminis∣tering to that passion he sees most predominant
in the person he would play upon. Thus he knows with you he cannot have a
recommendation like generosity and benevolence, and in the exercise of
these, though but in appearance, he insures himself a place in your
esteem. And these truths, for truths she will have them to be, are the
more strongly rooted in her mind by a firm belief that all we have heard
against Mr. Hazard originates from him.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Now I grant there is an air of extravagance in
these conjectures; nevertheless, though chequered by strong predelection,
and being but one con∣jecture hazarded againd another, probability is not one
moment neglected. The very best ac∣counts of him call him a man of unbounded
ex∣travagance, which surely has close relation to profligacy. Then if he is
in debt as much as the <PB N="95" REF="93"/> world says, were he to-morrow out
of parliament, he must be totally without fortune: in which case would he
be an eligible husband for An∣nette?</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'As to his accommodating disposition, which
Emma is so angry at, he will not practice it with much success upon you,
who know the world, or it would be very hard, full as well as Mr. Gloss; and
for the article of his practices against Mr. Hazard—which I confess I
hardly know how not to admit—it would be an ungentlemanlike advan∣tage,
which I am sure you would be the first to resent.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'In short, Emma thinks him an impostor, who
will one day or other be found out; and, for my own part, I wish his
condu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> was a little less
equi∣vocal, though under these, or any other circum∣stances, I fear no
surprise from him, or any other, while you are upon your guard.'</Q></P>
<P>Sir Sidney having heard his good lady to an end, thanked her for
her very kind, sensible, mild, and considerate speech, which he said
had nothing new or uncommon in it from her, but was only one of those
innumerable instances which he had received of the sweet benevolence of her
gentle nature. It <PB N="96" REF="94"/> seemed however to demand something
on his part, and he should answer it, he hoped, perfectly to the
purpose.</P>
<P>He began by admitting that Mr. Gloss's account of himself,
at first sight, was equivocal; but, how∣ever, we must not say a thing
is false because we could not prove it true. Mr. Gloss's father ap∣peared
to be an obscure character, but there was nothing new in that among people
who made for∣tunes in India. The young gentleman had certainly been
extravagant; he had now however retrenched, and lived within bounds. That there
was to be sure something in the report of his being in debt, for he had
himself given him a faithful account of it, but the money coming from India
would satisfy all those matters, and leave a handsome surplus. That as
to his good qualities, they were something more than external: the
assistance he had given to Castle∣wick, which was richer, and much more
extensive, through his advice and exertions, was a proof of it. But he had
other qualities, other talents, which, among liberal men, were paramount to
either birth or fortune, and ranked him pre-eminently among those whose
names were transmitted to posterity. He had all that was necessary to
make a consum∣mate statesman, and he had no doubt but the period was not
far distant when he would be seen to adorn <PB N="97" REF="95"/> one of the
first situations under government.—When this should be the case,
no objection could possibly lie against him, and he owned he should
then be sorry to hear his daughter refuse him for a husband.</P>
<P>As to any practices of his against the reputation of Mr
Hazard, they certainly existed only in Mrs. Emma's imagination; for it had
been his uniform practice to defend that unfortunate young gentle∣man as long
as truth and reason would permit him; but when proofs came so thick that a
man must be blind not to see them, he, like every body else, was obliged
to yield to conviction.</P>
<P>As to Mr. Hazard, every thing he did was ab∣surdity and
ill-judged profusion. He was at that moment engaging in schemes which could
not be effected by men of immense fortune and immense influence, and, what
was worse, under the colour of munificence, the view was profit. In short,
with a few thousands, he was in more ways than one new modelling customs,
which had been long cor∣dially received, and well established, and that the
consequence of this dream of riches and popularity would be his waking
probably in a few months a <PB N="98" REF="96"/> beggar: in which case could
he be called an eligi∣ble husband for Annette?</P>
<P>As to the variety of crimes laid to his charge, he would agree
that but one side had been heard, but whose fault was it? Why did he not,
if his cause would bear it, defend himself? Why truly he chose to take
the matter in dudgeon; to look highly, and feel himself offended because
people chose to believe what they heard! This might be a good cloak to hide a
weak plea, but did not at all look like innocence, which so far from fearing
in∣vestigation, he said, always sought it.</P>
<P>Had any thing like this been seen in Mr. Ha∣zard? So sar
from seeking the smallest explanation, had he not industriously
shunned all such opportu∣nities? Nay, was he not so conceitedly proud,
so ridiculously vain, when he had been supposed—for to this
moment it was not a certainty—to have be∣haved generously, as to reject
with contempt the acknowledgement of this imaginary kindness? and disclaim
the friendship of the man he would fain be thought to have obliged!</P>
<P>Upon the whole, he said, these were his ideas: that, in a
worldly point of view, Mr. Gloss was in∣finitely <PB N="99" REF="97"/> a
preferable husband for Annette. His talents were brilliant, he was himself
very popular, and would most probably one day be in a most ele∣vated
situation. On the contrary, Mr. Hazard—whose talents also were very
conspicuous, and whose accomplishments were not inferior to any
man's—by a perverse pride and false consequence, would every day
become lower in the world's opi∣nion, till he found himself starving with
indepen∣dant principles. 
<Q REND="inline">'However,' said Sir Sidney, 'you have named
yourself the compact, and I subscribe to it: while I find Annette
obedient, I shall not be unreasonable. In the interim, as I sincerely
believe that Mr. Gloss will certainly be possessed of both honour and
fortune—more perhaps than I have a right to expect in a
son-in-law—I desire he may be considered in the light of one whom I
have chosen to fill that character.'</Q></P>
<P>This retrospective chapter shews how matters stood in Sir
Sidney's family about the time Charles began to be a projector, from which
moment, to that in which his name appeared in the Gazette, he gradually sunk
in the opinion of the baronet; for, through the connivance of the
forestallers of law and beef, his name was bandied about in the newspapers
like a tennis ball; in which inoffensive <PB N="100" REF="98"/> amusement
Mr. Gloss was not idle; but when the Whereas made its appearance, and the
title of butcher was added to our hero's name, I sincerely believe, had there
been no such man as Mr. Gloss, or indeed no other than Charles, Annette
might have died a virgin, or married without her father's consent.</P>
<P>As to Emma, she entered into all the spirit of our hero's
schemes with enthusiasm. She declared it folly and ignorance to condemn
them; that the very enemies they begat were the strongest proofs of their
utility; that they evinced a nobleness of soul beyond all example in so
young a man; and that if Castlewick was a mole-hill in the scale of
liberality, Charles's projects were a mountain.</P>
<P>In short—and I cannot help thinking with her—Emma
saw so large, so benificent, so admirable a system of general good
in them, that nothing but the envy of individuals, and the degeneracy of the
public could prevent their arriving to that maturity which would perpetuate the
projects and the pro∣jector.</P>
<P>Emma greatly feared, however, the success of that scheme
that went to cure the abuses of the law; <PB N="101" REF="99"/> 
<Q REND="inline"> 'for well,' said she, 'did Pope Pius the
Second observe, that those who go to law are the birds, that the court is
the field, that the judges are the net, and the lawyers the fowlers.'</Q></P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER VII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>CONTAINS LOVE LETTERS, CHIMERICAL SPECULATIONS, AND SOME HINTS
CONCERNING PROFESSIONAL CAMELIONS.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>I shall now return to Charles, who, that he might understand
the extent of not only his pos∣sessions, but his expectations, received
the day af∣ter he became a free man, an account that his noble brother was
blest with an heir to his title and es∣tate.</P>
<P>As our hero had long accustomed himself to look up to no one
for assistance, he now saw the abso∣lute necessity of sitting
down without embarrass∣ment to consider in what way he should make his
talents turn out to his advantag. To do this, he looked his situation full in
the face, and immedi∣ately with a sigh of affection and regret, blest the
remembrance of that provident father, who had seemed to have foreseen this
moment, and armed him against it. His pen had already been cele∣brated in the
highest terms of panegyric. His pen∣cil <PB N="103" REF="101"/> had procured
him very lavish encomiums, even from the most flourishing artists, and
his talent for music was allowed not to be inferior to either of the others.
He therefore thought it hard if he could not live independantly, when he had
three such re∣sources. At the same time he knew that to become a public
man he must condescend, and, in order to do so, all former high
prejudices and perspective notions of situation and opulence must be
con∣quered; for though the public was a noble and liberal master, yet his
would be at best a situation of mental servitude.</P>
<P>His next idea was how he should render his abi∣ties worthy of
such an illustrious patronage; and the result of this reflection became
naturally a reso∣lution to produce works of general utility, such as would
promote the cause of genius and literature, and were dear to the interests
of virtue and mora∣lity.</P>
<P>And now to wean himself from all vain expecta∣tions. His
first effort was an adieu to Annette, which would have been poetry but that
there was too much of the heart in it to be dressed in the garb of fiction.
There was so much pure feeling, in∣deed noble self-denial, and exalted love
in it, that it took but a few minutes to write it. The anguish 
<PB N="104" REF="102"/> of that short time could scarcely be repaid by an
age of happiness. It was like tearing the vitals, and Emma, when she read
it, declared that the agony of the young Spartan was nothing to it; for the
reader sees the difficulty was to bear the tor∣ment, yet give the
consolation. This was the letter: 
<LETTER>
<HEAD>TO MISS ROEBUCK.</HEAD>
<P> THIS letter, best of creatures, is supported by the
strongest proof I ever yet gave you of my love. I am no longer in a
situation to look up to you, and therefore must think no more of that
happiness which can never be mine. Let our re∣solution to part be mutual,
and worthy that affec∣tion which has no example, but which fate will not
indulge.</P>
<P> Your love, charming Annette, equals mine; but your task
is easier. You have a thousand consolations to which I am a stranger,
yet I rea∣dily set you an example which it would diminish the glory of your
sentiments not to follow. Imi∣tate me willingly. Let your love—which
had made up the perfection of your character—in the <PB N="105" REF="103"/> very moment while your heart yields to the dio∣tates of your duty,
approve the noble resolution. Ours were fond expectations: providence has
thought fit to disappoint them. Let us not mur∣mur then, but retain those
mutual good wishes, as friends, which we must not cherish as lovers.</P>
<P> Adieu. Fail not to let your resolution be, like mine,
cool, calm, and collected: so shall my An∣nette be additionally lovely to

<CLOSER><SIGNED>CHARLES HAZARD.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER></P>
<P>I will not say that these lines cost so little trouble
to the mind of our hero as they appear to express; for indeed he felt in
proportion as he endeavoured to conceal his feelings. This was the
process:—Mrs. Marlow brought him pen, ink, and paper—he sat
down—wrote his letter—read it over—en∣closed it to
Emma—directed it—kissed it—gave it to a
porter—assured Mrs. Marlow he never was so pleased in his
life—and then fell off the chair, upon the ground, in a state of
insensibility!</P>
<P>In short, all the tricks of his French delirium, and perhaps
consumption, would probably have <PB N="106" REF="104"/> succeeded this
event, had he not received, the next morning, the following letter from
Annette. 
<LETTER>
<HEAD>TO CHARLES HAZARD ESQ.</HEAD>
<P> To induce my admiration of the excess of your love, and
the delicacy of your sentiments, the terrible, though tender proof you gave
me yesterday was unnecessary.</P>
<P> Ah Charles! have you no other argument to cure me of
affection? Must I forget you only be∣cause you prove yourself every day
more worthy to be remembered?—and can honour be so cruel as to require
a sacrifice of my happiness at the shrine of what the world calls
justice? But your virtue should be more resolute than mine, which is
feminine, and has, and ought to have, its weak∣ness; therefore learn, I
cannot obey you in this one hard injunction, though it would be the pride of my
life to submit to every other. I will never cease to love you, command me
how you may. I will be faithfully, affectionately, uniformly yours; and as my
father has promised me he will never insist upon my marrying any man I
cannot love, so you will plainly see I can never marry

you, that, at present, it will be improper to continue our correspondence:
for what length of time fortune knows best. This however I know, that it is
both to my interest and my happiness to declare, even to the whole world,
as firmly as I do to you, that, be your fortune what it may, I shall ever be,
unalterably,</P>

</LETTER></P>
<P>The reader may judge what sort of cordial this letter proved
to a lover, who had been alternately shivering with low spirits, or raving
in a fever the whole night. The faithful Mrs. Marlow saw the progress of
this medicine with tears of gratitude, and our hero, after reading it ten
times, kissing it five hundred, and imploring all the angels in hea∣ven to
bless and protect so much beauty and good∣ness, mustered up spirits
enough to turn his mind again towards his affairs.</P>
<P>Charles had, upon two former occasions, sent pictures to the
royal academy, as an honorary ex∣hibiter. When he attended the dinner, upon St.
Luke's day, he received from the president and se∣veral of the members, the
most extravagant marks <PB N="108" REF="106"/> of applause. He thought
therefore he could not do a more eligible thing than to begin his scientific
career by sending a couple of pictures to the next exhibition, with a
modest price affixed to them, by way of advertisement, that he meant in
future to resort to painting, among other things, for a main∣tenance.</P>
<P>The pictures were accompanied by a respectful letter to the
president—who, he doubted not, would do him justice—intreating
to be considered in future as a common, and not an honourary, exhibiter.</P>
<P>This done, he waited with impatience for the success of his
stratagem. The exhibition was ad∣advertised, our hero received his ticket
of admission, and repaired to the place, where, for twenty mi∣nutes, he
could not find either of his pictures. He tumbled over the catalogue, which
eased him of half his fear—for he had fancied they were both
rejected—by informing him that one of his perfor∣mances was certainly in
some part of one of the rooms. Vainly however did he search for a
consi∣derable while, till at length, being upon the point of giving the
matter up, elevating his sight, in a nook, close to the sky-light, he
fancied he had dis∣covered the object of his perquisition.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="107"/> The picture however was scarcely known
to him, though he had painted it; for one single streak of light fell upon
it at the right hand corner at the top, which gleamed towards the centre, where
it rested in a speck; while a sudden shadow, occa∣sioned by the
projection of the chimney piece, cut it across from the left hand corner at
top to the right hand corner at bottom, forming an angle with one half of the
frame. In short, it had exactly the effect of a looking glass, badly
painted, in a cham∣ber scene for the theatre, which idea must occur to
every reader.</P>
<P>This was not all: Had either of the pictures been seen alone,
it could not possibly have had the smallest effect, for they
appertained to each other like ques∣tion and answer. Charles therefore
saw it was an affront, and was more strongly confirmed in this when he
found his other picture tossed about with a hole in it. Upon an application
for redress, he was told he might take away his daubings, if he dis∣liked
their situation.</P>
<P>Charles could not conceive how it could happen that
professors of a liberal art knew so little of the manners of gentlemen;
but, since he found it so, he resolved to shew them he could right
himself, <PB N="110" REF="108"/> even with the very tool for which they
seemed so to despise him.</P>
<P>To effect this, he painted a picture to which was annexed this
explanation.</P>
<P>A sovereign prince, in a certain country, had built a palace;
to decorate which various poten∣tates contributed many costly presents.
One, a∣mong the rest, sent a collection of pictures, all the works of
eminent artists. That these might be distributed in advantageous
situations, the prince sent for the heads of the royal academy, to perform
that task as their judgment should direct them.</P>
<P>After fixing several according to their distinction, which
indeed gave but little trouble, for they were all, as it appeared, labelled,
they came to one about which they could not find this mark of distinction,
and therefore, concluding that the picture was of no value, they condemned it
to be placed in the temple of Cloacina.</P>
<P>Our hero's picture represented the academecians marching with
the picture, in solemn procession, to put the above sentence in
execution. The most ac∣tive among them were those with whom he had 
<PB N="111" REF="109"/> the greatest reason to be offended, and the
like∣nesses were so strong, that it was impossible to mis∣take
them. But, to crown the joke, he introduced a portrait of himself, in the
foreground, holding up the label they had vainly searched for:—on which
was written GUIDO.</P>
<P>This picture he exhibited in an auction room, hired for the
purpose; and, for a time, it actually drew away the company from the
exhibition of the artists.</P>
<P>He became immediately known, and might have had some practice
at portrait painting; but, find∣ing it impossible to make people handsome
enough, he forewent this most servile of all mental drudgery, and declared
altogether for pieces of thought and fancy, in which he found his genius more
gratified. These however nobody understood, and they re∣mained unsold. A
picture dealer or two offered to treat for them, provided he would smoak
them, and varnish them repeatedly, till they were all over cracks; for, in
that case, they would give them new names, and pass them upon the public:
es∣pecially if there were a few holes burnt in the drapery, or an eye poked
out of the principal figure.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="110"/> This kind of servile imposition,
however, our hero did not chuse to submit to, and his pictures went
unsold.</P>
<P>Charles had become slightly acquainted with a young artist,
who appeared very anxious that he should push his fortune, and informed him
there was but one way, which was portrait painting—Charles told him he
had practised it without suc∣cess. 
<Q REND="inline">'Ay, but you did not go the right way to work,'
answered the other 'It is not painting a lady's likeness will do: you
understand me:—you must favour a lady with a living likeness, if
you wish to do any good. In short, if the painter be young and
handsome—and dam'me if I think either you or I frightful—a lady
sits to him with a view that he should make love to her! And then such
opportunities! Please my dear ma'am to look at me:—more full if you
please:—your eyes more languishing:—now bite your under lip to
pout it:—smile, if you please:—very well! Pray don't you think,
as this is a fancy dress, that shoulder should be bare?—a part of
the neck seen?—the rest throbbing, as it were, through the
handkerchief? Permit me to adjust it. Heavens! what a skin!—what
roundness!—what tints! The Venus of Titian was plaster to 
<PB N="113" REF="111"/> it! In short, in adjusting her handkerchief, her
bosom throbs in good earnest, she takes you to her arms, and your labours
become real nature, instead of imitative.'</Q></P>
<P>Charles laughed heartily at this description, and then
resuming a more serious air, asked if there were any instances of
these sort of amours.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Indeed there are,' answered the other.
'Gen∣teel young fellows never need be without them, and it is their own faults
if they do not snap up fortunes. But they are a set of stupid
block∣heads, without manner or address; and when they conceive an idea of
that sort, they generally come into disgrace. It was but the other day a
foolish brother of the brush made his declaration too prematurely—for
you know my dear sir there is a manner, a delicacy in such
matters—and was kicked out of the house for his pains. Master
Musquito though was a little too cunning. Ay, he is a dry hand!'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Musquito,' said Charles, 'What
Musquito?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Why you know well enough,' said the other,'
'Sir Sidney used to invite him to his house. Don't you know what has
happened to him. Upon se∣cond <PB N="114" REF="112"/> thoughts it must have
happened while you were in France. Only married to a woman of seven
thousand a year; that is all. Ay, ay, they may talk of poets writing
themselves into a lady's good graces, or a musician tickling their ears,
but I say the painter is the man to succeed. He situates the zones of his
Venuses, he festoons the petticoats of his buskined Dianas, he—in
short, no man except a footman or a dancing master is so sure of
success, if he minds his hits.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Well I hope you will mind yours,' said
Charles, 'but this you tell me of Musquito is astonishing.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'It is very true I assure you,' answered
the other. 'That sour crab, that sloe, that green medlar, that cut-lemon of
a fellow, has made a handsome woman's mouth water to the tune of seven
thou∣sand a year. But Lord you know nothing of what our old codgers are. Do
you think the nymphs who are drawn every evening come merely for the
improvement of the young students? No such thing. They are procured for the
recreation of the old ones, I promise you. But this is all well enough. Let
them live in luxury and abuse the royal bounty as much as they like, but do
not let them, now they are past it themselves, check the fair progress of
young fellows like us, who are endeavouring to push ourselves forward in
the <PB N="115" REF="113"/> world, by the laudable exercise of our
industry.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'And all its adventitious consequences,'
said Charles, 'among which you reckon, of course, our chance with the
ladies.'</Q></P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER VIII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>MORE EXPECTATIONS, AND MORE DISAPPOINTMENTS<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WE have seen the same mind in our hero as to revenge ever
since we first noticed him. If he aimed at punishing others, it was with
a view to general justice. Certainly there could not be any thing more
unhandsome than for a set of men, esta∣blished in their profession,
and established only for the purpose of giving novices their countenance
and support, to neglect the productions of a young man who was likely to
ornament a liberal art, and not only artfully conceal his merits, but
disjoint its ef∣fect, so as, had it been seen, it could not have been
understood.</P>
<P>Their comment on his satirical picture was, that matters were
come truly to a fine pass if a young, inexperienced dauber could dare to
attack a royal corporation in such an audacious manner, and then have the
insolence, by implication, to call himself a GUIDO.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="115"/> Our hero however defended himself
against this, by saying that he did not profess painting; and very likely
should never take up a pencil again; but as the picture told well with the
public, through the medium of those striking likenesses it contained,
he might modestly enough take to himself some little merit; and as to the
name of GUIDO, it was evidently a stroke at their ignorance, and not a mark
of his own vanity: for it did not say they are hiding my picture in a certain
place, though it has the merit of GUIDO, but they are hiding GUIDO himself;
and this also says I forgive you for that neglect which originated from
your ignorance; for if you have served GUIDO in that manner, why should I
repine at being coupled with so great a painter?</P>
<P>From the moment Charles set out as an artist, he guarded
against all consequences, by supplying himself at his leisure moments
with materials for forwarding his interest in every branch he professed.
Thus, he had scarcely sent his pictures to the ex∣hibition, but he
considered how he might make music turn to account. He could not buckle to
teaching music any more than to portrait painting, for he plainly saw that
none but the packhorses of music stood a chance in this branch. Such as
could exalt claws into a fine finger, find sweet tones in a 
<PB N="118" REF="116"/> dissonant squall, in short, submit to all the
ignorant conceited airs of wire-breaking young Misses, flatter their
mammas, dandle the younger children upon their knees, deliver written
appointments for assig∣nations, which were sometimes directed to
them∣selves, and such other kind of drudgery as appends to the duty of
these under servants, these scrubers and scullions of the
muses.</P>
<P>As to the theatre, he had gained some little ex∣perience of
that before, and if, in quality of master, he was obliged to retire, what
chance did he stand in quality of servant?—for as servants he well
knew all those must expect to be treated who wished to give their
productions to the public through that medium. Then as to publications, the
country was inundated by Italian and German compositions, which obtained
patronage through the medium of some man of distinction, to whose
pleasures the com∣poser administered sometimes in a way that an
En∣glishman would starve rather than submit to.</P>
<P>In the midst of a variety of cogitations on this subject, he
was called on by his old friend Toogood, who had lately put himself very
forward in the mu∣sical world.</P>
<P>This son of Apollo told Charles, that as he un∣derstood 
<PB N="119" REF="117"/> he had thoughts of devoting himself to the muses,
for a livelihood, he should be happy so serve him in so meritorious a
determination. He flattered himself, he said, that as he had got into a
conspi∣cuous situation, by making his profession subser∣vient to
his interest, he, of all others, had it most in his power to point out the
only way in music to profit and reputation.</P>
<P>Mr. Toogood professed a great opinion of our hero's
professional abilities, and still more of his good sense and
knowledge of the world, and doubted not, as he had smarted severely for his
follies, that he would now take up, and consider that men's talents were
given to work out their own advan∣tage.</P>
<P>Charles, seeing his drift, encouraged him to open his whole
budget, through which he learnt that, from his youth, he had made it a practice
of levying contributions on people of no taste, by which means he was become
the Apollo, or rather the Orpheus, of the day; that he was looked up to as the
regulater of style and leader of fashion in mu∣sic; and all this he laid
open in a plain narrative of his life and principles, without omitting a
single circumstance of either his own duplicity, or the credulity of his
patrons.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="118"/> Having heard him to an end, this was our
hero's answer. 
<Q REND="inline">'And so Mr. Toogood, because you have all
your life, under the appearance of cringing, trim∣ming, and many other
truckling and wretchedly accommodating shifts, vitiated the public taste,
and scandalized a beautiful and useful art, you would have me copy your
creeping servility!—Sir you affront me both as a musician and a
gen∣tleman, by your unworthy and contemptible pro∣posal. It is such as you
the world has to thank for introducing mystery and difficulty into the
plainest system of rational pleasure the soul of man can receive; for
setting up an inexplicable stan∣dard to judge of that which is the
essence of ease and simplicity. No, Mr. Toogood, I despise the
servility of your mind as much as I reprobate the fallacy of your doctrines;
and, much as I value popular esteem, I should disdain to accept it
otherwise than as a tribute to exertions intended to convey rational
pleasure and solid advantage.'</Q></P>
<P>Charles however did nothing by this sort of conduct but invite
enemies. But this did not stop him. He really could not bridle his
resent∣ment. To see men pervert the very end of nature's gifts, and
endeavour to confirm others in error, instead of leading them out of it,
deserved, he said, reprobation of the severest kind, and he was
deter∣mined <PB N="121" REF="119"/> at least to drag such monstrous
impostors into open day, and expose their deformities, after which it would
be the world's fault if such counterfeit coin was suffered to pass
current.</P>
<P>Charles had yet done but little in the way of pro∣fit. Indeed he
did not see how he could; for it was so dirty a road, that he had not the
resolution to follow it. It became however necessary that he should
think of something in good earnest. For this purpose he completed an
opera, which he had had long in contemplation, and which he had been repeatedly
requested by one of the managers to put the finishing stroke to. He
sent it, and as he knew pretty well the trim of this sort of business,
his compact was that he would stand or fall by its me∣rits, without the
interference of any other person. This was charming, it would have a
prodigious run, and every attention should be paid it.</P>
<P>Our hero called on the manager to consult on the necessary
steps to bring it before the public. He was still received with great
warmth. He wished however he would be advised. 
<Q REND="inline">'In what?'</Q> Why suppose he waited upon
the editors of the different papers, to bespeak favour. 
<Q REND="inline">'Why? If it deserved applause it was to come
from the public, not the <PB N="122" REF="120"/> newspapers. If it did not,
their purchased fa∣vour would be a satire on the performance, and an
insult to the public.'</Q> This was good theory, but not practicable. Charles
said it should be prac∣ticable in his case, or nothing should. It was
ma∣terial to him to come at the truth. If he falsely flattered himself, and
had not abilities for what he had undertaken, nothing could be kinder than to
undeceive him. If he had, let his reward come spontaneously from those
who he was sure would pay it with interest if it was his due. He spoke
charmingly; it was a pity he did not know what stage conduct was. Charles
said it was a pity the manager did not know what it ought to be. The manager
rallied Charles, and Charles did not spare the manager, who however did not
wish to lose the piece, of which he had a great opinion.</P>
<P>After some necessary matters were settled, they parted,
agreeing that the opera, like an act of parliament in a certain stage,
should be copied for the use of the members.</P>
<P>Charles that very evening received a summons to breakfast
with the manager the next morning. He went, and had he not known his man,
must have been astonished at seeing himself treated with a dis∣tant
coolness. He had been thinking; some of the <PB N="123" REF="121"/>
passages did not strike him as at first: A friend of his—. Our
hero gave him, in a few words, to un∣derstand that, by agreement, no friends
were to interfere. It was very true, but the expence of a first piece was a
large stake. Very likely, our hero said, and if he felt his promise hang
awkwardly upon him, he was ready to acquit him of it. Oh by no means. Well it
should be as he pleased:—but did not he think a few
alterations— 
<Q REND="inline">'Not one,' said Charles. 'If you say a word
more about it, I will put the piece in my pocket.'</Q> In short they parted
but barely civil: the piece was however left.</P>
<P>A few days afterwards they had another meeting. The manager was
all rapture. He begged our hero would not be offended at what was done, but
indeed it was impossible to be offended. He should see.</P>
<P>A new copy of the piece was then produced, with alterations in
the hand writing of four dif∣ferent people, whom he knew to be retainers to the
house, and were the very men and women—for this was the fact—who
at that time kept away those real geniuses to whom I have said Charles
formerly paid visits of solicitation, and nauseated the town with their
own insipid trash.</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="122"/> Charles cast his eyes over the copy
merely to as∣certain this fact, and then said 
<Q REND="inline">'Sir, independant of theatrical business, I
know no one more a gen∣tleman than yourself. Upon theatrical business I
never knew a man so pitifully mean. Supposing it would answer any good
purpose in your wise politics to make a shew of my piece, to invite
whatever dunce thinks proper to come and blot it, do you think sir so
contemptibly of me as to suppose I will bear it. But, putting that out of
the question, can any thing so strongly evince your ignorance both of
theatrical performances and your own interest? If I submitted to these
alte∣rations, would not every individual who made them claim his own feather,
while I must quietly stand to be plucked? and, for God's sake, what
feathers are they? Have they made me a bit handsomer? So far from it, that
which was, if not superb and magnificent, yet neat and decent, is now altered
into a motley fool's jacket. But, sir, you may take the materials and make
them into a cap for your own wear. In short, I shall trust to your honour
not to make use of my ideas to your advantage, and as for any thing else, I
am your humble servant.'</Q></P>
<P>The manager however would not let him go. He begged him to
consider that the scenes were paint∣ing, <PB N="125" REF="123"/> that he had
engaged a singer at a high sa∣lary.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'I do not care for that sir,' said Charles;
'it is dishonourable not to abide by your agreement; you had the evidence of
your senses <HI>prima facie:</HI> you can have no more now. What have they
de∣cided? Why truly that the meanest scribbler in your house is to give
laws to me. But, as I said, letting alone that see-saw, your own
judgment, you have done a thing totally against your in∣terest; for these
poor creatures, whose trash cer∣tainly never shall stand a part of the
piece, losing the merit of having made these alterations—which by
this time they have vaunted to all their friends—will become enemies both
to the piece and me: so, for your caprice, I am obliged to wage war with a
set of poor reptiles, who have not offended me, and whom I have no more
in∣clination to tread upon than any other worms, which, searching for food,
are unlucky enough to come under my feet. In short, bad as it is, for this
last time, I will overlook this strange con∣duct, since you talk of
losses which certainly I do not wish you to sustain; but I insist
that every word shall be expunged which I may not justly claim as my
own.'</Q> This was at length agreed <PB N="126" REF="124"/> to, and a morning
for the first rehearsal was ap∣pointed.</P>
<P>The day came, the words were read, during which some of the
actors, as they were instructed, yawned at particular passages. These
were after∣wards to be objected against by the manager, which Charles well
knowing, anticipated, by taking him aside, and telling him that he saw what
he was aim∣ing at, but it would not do, for that every passage at which the
performers had so ill acted the part of yawners, should remain without the
smallest alte∣ration. He said, however implicitly the manager might pin
his faith upon the sleeve of such opinions, he would not wish a better
omen of success than an actors entertaining an indifferent opinion of a
dra∣matic entertainment; for that, in general, they were men of very slender
intellects and mean education, who had no opportunity of making worldly
obser∣vation but at the porter house, or in the green room, who had now in
tragedy destroyed what was meant for a representation of greatness, by
stalking like puppets, and braying like asses, and who had no idea of
comedy otherwise than by grinning like apes and chattering like parrots.
Besides, in the present case, poor devils, it was a repetition of the
same miserable farce which had so recently been performed by the authors.
They were bid to feel <PB N="127" REF="125"/> as the others were. He wondered
therefore that the manager would attempt at treating him so un∣worthily, when
he knew how ill such former illibe∣rality had been stomached.</P>
<P>The patentee was certainly nettled enough at this spirited
conduct of our hero. He however thought proper to suppress what he felt,
and they proceeded to the music-room, where every thing was ready for a
repetition of the music.</P>
<P>The moment Charles entered the room, he was surrounded by the
females. 
<Q REND="inline">'Lord, Mr. Hazard, cried one, 'don't you think
this here round o is monstrous frightful? You ought to have given me a song
full of divisions, and runs, and shakes, to shew my powers.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Let us hear it played, Miss Forward,' said
Charles.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Oh Lord,' re∣plied the lady, 'there is no
occasion for that, I have played it all over myself with one finger, and I
tell you it will have no effect.'</Q></P>
<P>She was going on with remarks on her other songs, but Charles
turned from her. He was however as badly off, for he found the principal
singer in high words with the manager, because the puppy of a composer
had truly thought proper to restrict her in her cadences. What did he mean by
such inso∣lence? <PB N="128" REF="126"/> Had any body ever attempted to
point out to a mistress of her profession any limits to her
candenza?</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'I know madam,' said Charles, 'that it is
al∣most as vain an attempt as to prescribe limits to her impertinence; but,
in one word, those who sing for me shall sing what I have written, and
nothing else. It is my music, and not yours, I chuse madam to give to the
world; and, to tell you the truth, what little abilities I have shall be
exerted to explode the candenza which has lately obtained to the scandal of
taste, and the total ex∣clusion of every characteristic by which music
ought to be distinguished. As it is, singing is be∣come a vehicle to
convey every thing that is ex∣traordinary, and nothing that is pleasing.
Na∣ture, feeling, expression, and, above all, a con∣veyance of the poet's
ideas—beyond which every thing in vocal music is impertinence—all
these are disregarded. The lady who sings highest, lowest, longest,
and loudest is the best singer; and thus all you principal performers
stand squall∣ing and stretching out your necks like the crow in the
fable, forgetful of the fox underneath, who not only laughs at your folly, but
stands ready to snap up the cheese, the moment it falls out of your
mouths.'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="127"/> 
<Q REND="inline">'Yes,' said the lady, 'but we take care not to
let it fall out of our mouths. No, no, there is no fear of our getting
cheese, when you poets cannot get bread.'</Q></P>
<P>This witticism was echoed by a loud ha, ha! throughout the
whole room; after which, an un∣derstrapper coming up familiarly to Charles,
cried, 
<Q REND="inline">'Why I say, they gives it you home brother
Bruin: but never mind it: this is nothing at all when you are used to
it.'</Q></P>
<P> Charles, turning to the manager, who also heard this, said,

<Q REND="inline">'you are very kind, and no doubt find it much to
your interest to tolerate this: for, were not that the case, this fellow
would not dare to add so much impudence to his ignorance.'</Q></P>
<P>The manager made some trifling apology, smiled a sneer,
and desired the repetition might begin.</P>
<P>Many of the songs were now performed, to every one of which
its respective singer was suffered to make some ignorant objection. At
length they came to a sort of bravura song, in the midst of which the
leader of the band laid down his fiddle, with an exclamation of 
<Q REND="inline">'Oh my Gad, my Gad! I vome play dis.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'What is the matter now?' <PB N="130" REF="128"/>
said the manager.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Sir,' cried the enraged fiddler, 'it is no
good, no raight, no arminny.'</Q> He then proceeded to a string of
reasoning, which, as it was unintelligible to every hearer, so it must be
of course to every reader.</P>
<P> He had scarce done this when Charles said, 
<Q REND="inline">'and pray sir how long have all the laws of
music ac∣knowledged you as their Lord Chancellor? How long has the
supremest pleasure of the soul sub∣mitted to an arbitrator sullen,
envious, and ma∣lignant?—without taste, genius, or intellects!—a
dreaming law-giver to sound, a mad mathema∣tical musician! How long have
the social en∣joyments of the mind been estimated by measure and
tale?—by niggardly scanty, constrained por∣tions? Go and pore over an
ox's eye, study op∣tics, measure vacancy, and thus get at the dimen∣sions
of your own brain. Go and <HI>exist,</HI> but dare not think of the enjoyment
of those that <HI>live.</HI>'</Q>—And then turning to the manager, 
<Q REND="inline">'Please sir to give orders that the
repetition may go on.'</Q> This the manager thought proper to do, and it was
fi∣nished with no further interruption worth men∣tioning.</P>
<P> As soon as it was over, Charles said to the ma∣nager 
<Q REND="inline">'Sir, I must beg, before your people leave 
<PB N="131" REF="129"/> the room, that they may hear my declaration to you. With
great earnestness you invited me to this task; you took ample time to
deliberate on the merits of what I produced you; and we had settled a
convention that I am convinced would have been a mutual convenience to us. It
was the duty of your people, according to my conception, to receive their
instructions, and implicitly to ob∣serve them. For my part; had any
person repre∣sented to me, in reasonable language, that any particular
alteration was necessary either for his or her convenience, or the
advantage of the piece, I should with willing pleasure have paid such
ob∣servations every attention they could possibly me∣rit; but, sir,
evidently by your connivance, I have sustained affronts from many of your
people, who, poor wretches, mean me no ill-will, by doing that which your
frequent permission has stampt into a duty. Your drift then appears to
lower me to the abject, contemptible humiliation of those authors and
musicians, who depend on you, and who administering to your ignorance and
caprice, insult the public with nonsense and barbarism, to the
disgrace of letters, and the total perversion of science. Keep these at
your beck and call and welcome, but let me warn you not to expect again that
you can with impunity make a tool of any man who has ground to think 
<PB N="132" REF="130"/> worthily of himfelf, and virtue enough to be
in∣dependant, lest an exposition of your arcana rouse the offended public
to support the cause of in∣jured merit, and oblige you to restore those
men of talents, for whose encouragement your theatre was given you in
trust. Others may be roused; for my part, I shall content myself with
smiling on you with contempt.'</Q></P>
<P>So saying, he walked out of the house, no one attempting to
interfere; for the performers looked on one another in astonishment, to
see an author who refused to be a foot ball, and the manager, who saw it
would be to no purpose to detain our hero at present, was meditating how he
might keep both the piece and the author at his own disposal.</P>

<P>As soon as our hero got home, he sent for his piece.
Instead of it, however, he received the fol∣lowing letter. 
<LETTER>
<HEAD>TO CHARLES HAZARD, ESQ.</HEAD>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P> Your warmth this morning prevented you from seeing how
much I wish to do you every justice. I think some of the performers were
right in their objections. The piece wants cut∣ting, and really I think it
would be of use to you to admit a few Italian songs. You know those
capital women will give themselves airs. Upon the whole, as the necessary
alterations will take up some time—and, besides, I have an
after-piece to bring out immediately—I would wish <PB N="134" REF="132"/> you to revise your opera before its next rehearsal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> In the mean time you may call upon the
treasurer for fifty pounds.</P>
<CLOSER>
<SIGNED>Yours, &amp;c. —</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER></P>
<P>Without a moment's consideration, Charles wrote the following
answer. 
<LETTER>
<HEAD>TO — ESQ.</HEAD>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P> I have declared my sentiments plainly enough already, and
I will not trouble myself more about this pitiful business than to say
that I now demand my piece, and that I am perfectly indifferent as to
yourself, your actors, your capi∣tal women, your after-piece, or your fifty
pounds, which last article I do not believe I am more in necessity for
than you are. The bearer has di∣rections not to come away without the
opera.</P>
<CLOSER>
<SIGNED>I am, sir, Your humble servant, C.
HAZARD.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER></P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="133"/> The piece was not sent, and it was with
some difficulty he got it back again, two months after∣wards. Thus ended his
connection with the the∣atre.</P>
<P>Our hero's next effort was among the booksellers. Many offers
were made him to work by the sheet, but these he rejected with contempt; at
which he was given to understand that haughty demeanour would totally
destroy all his expectations; for though to work for the theatre might be
very humiliating, to work for the trade would be still more so.—Could
he submit to estimate his work as they sell poetry to the chandlers
shops, by weight? Could he watch publications as they fell in, and became
universal property, mutilate them, and make an unconnected jumble out of
them, under the title of 'Beauties of an eminent Poet?' Could he take the old
magazines and newspapers, and make out of them a new periodical publication?
Had he a knack of criticising authors that never existed?—Was he
expert, without plan or necessity, at poetic ribaldry, which dealt about
the faeces of satire against all ranks and distinctions, without either
its truth, its elegance, or its point?—and especially against that
high character whose heart is the seat of goodness and mercy, whose
private worth is the criterion of domestic virtue, and whose public
ex∣cellence <PB N="136" REF="134"/> is not more distinguishable by the
splendour of his situation, than by the gracious beneficence with which he
adorns it.</P>
<P>Could he feign epitaphs? Anticipate parliament speeches? Make
men of abilities write nonsensical odes?—or invent dull good things,
spoken by a dead doctor? Could he one day pull down the fa∣brick of the
constitution, and the next build it up again?</P>
<P>If he could not do any of these, he had better be hackney
writer to an attorney, clerk to a lottery office, or any thing than an author.
Where was the use of any thing new? Had not every thing that can be said on
all possible subjects been ex∣hausted time out of mind? Was there a
single idea that, at this time of day, could be put in a new point of view?
How many histories of England were there? How many histories of other
coun∣tries? How many general histories? And yet could any body say which
should be credited? No, no, the mystery of writing was now at an end; the
whole business was compiling; and it was the ex∣treme of arrogance in any
person to expect payment but as a compiler. In short, if he would quietly
put on his apron and sleeves, take the scissors, the wa∣sers, and the
paste pot, come contentedly into the <PB N="137" REF="135"/> garret, and
sell his labour for as much as it was worth, he might get pretty bread
enough; but if not, he had better take a pickaxe or a beetle, and dig graves or
thump the pavement.</P>
<P>This was the sum of his reception with several to whom he
applied. At length however he thought he had nicked the very chance that would
make his fortune. He was recommended to a bookseller of the name of Alley,
who he was informed dealt largely and liberally. To him he went, and very
candidly told him that, as he had the reputation of a man of worth, an
extensive publisher, and a libe∣ral dealer, he should be glad to treat
with him for some things he had by him.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Sir,' replied Alley, 'Mr. Hazard, I shall
say in answer to this here proposial, that I am a man of fortune, and I
spends what I gets freely: ben't afraid dam'me of a few shiners: and when I
sees a work that's a work of merit, I deals upon the nail, and as a gentleman
should. Here, harkee in the shop there. Did the lady in her chariot call
this morning?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'No.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'No! dam'me you always say no. But my lord did
though, or else Sir Peter. In short sir—I say, one of my people,
bring me the keys of the warehouse. Stop now—look <PB N="138" REF="136"/> at this drawer: full, chuck full—all novels—I supply
every library in the kingdom. Going to bring out a fire, new, novel edition of
Thomas Hickathrift, for schools. Oh the keys, you shall see my
warehouse.'</Q></P>
<P>So saying, he lugged our hero into another street, where he
introduced him to an immense number of publications, in sheets. 
<Q REND="inline">'There,' said he, 'did you ever see any
thing like this? Here is a grand edition of Mother Goose's Tales, purceeded
with a wooden frontispiece, for the Christmas holidays; all titivated up, out
of other things, by gradivates from the two universes of Oxford and
Cambridge. I pays them well; one has had seventeen and sixpence before
hand. Yes, yes, every body knows my generosity: but then its a damned fine
thing to be charitable.'</Q></P>
<P>Thus he ran over all the rooms in the house, pointing out,
upon every shelf, some new book of equal importance with those already
mentioned, till at length he convinced our hero he was conceited, ignorant, and
purse proud, and alike a stranger to taste and liberality.</P>
<P>Charles, seeing this, determined to cut the matter short. 
<Q REND="inline">'Pray,' said he, 'Mr. Alley, do you read 
<PB N="139" REF="137"/> all these things before they come out?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Read!' said the other, 'I read! Dam'me, you
think that I can read! No, no, I got other guess work to mind I can tell you.
My gradivates, and my par∣sons, and them there fellows read. No, no, I can't
do every thing. I can only say if you'll fa∣vour me with any of your works in
the novel way—novels you see are my forte—they shall be read,
and, if they meet approbation, money, dam'me money is no object. In short, as
I say in my advertisement, to such ladies and gentle∣men as favour me
with their manuscripts, that I flatter, supported by their patronage, to
render in future what has been esteemed frivile, of stand∣ing merit,
entertainment, and general improve∣ment.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'There's epitaphs for you!'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'They are very extraordinary epithets indeed,'
said Charles.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Ay, ay, epithets,' returned Alley, 'you are
right: dam'me my head is always a wool ga∣thering. Well sir, shall I be
favoured with your manuscript?'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Why sir,' said Charles, 'I will be very
plain with you. I have a thing something in the style of a novel, which I
will send you. It will make two small duodecimo volumes.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Ay twelves, I understand you,' returned the
bookseller, 'that's right, I like twelves.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'But I premise,' added <PB N="140" REF="138"/>
our hero, 'that if your graduates find any merit in them, I expect to receive a
handsome gratuity for my labours.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'That's enough,' said Alley, 'send them; we
shan't disagree.'</Q></P>
<P>They parted: Charles sent his book, and, after repeated
attempts to get it back again, or an answer to his terms, he at length
received the following letter. 
<LETTER>
<HEAD>TO CHARLES HAZARD ESQ. THESE PRESENT.</HEAD>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P> I received yours, and I am sorry my ab∣sence, being out
of town, deprived my answer.</P>
<P> Your book, unfortunably, does not meet ap∣probation; as
such, is returned. You may send for it to my house, in Leadenhead-Lane,
when convenient; only please to say which it is, as I have so many,
otherwise you may not get the right.</P>
<CLOSER>
<SIGNED>I am, in great haste, Your very humble servant,
WILLIAM ALLEY.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER></P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="139"/> This letter, as well it might, gave our
hero a surfeit of booksellers. Heavens! how he pitied Mr. Alley's parsons
and graduates. It was a sen∣sible satire upon an enlightened age. But was
there really no trace of that liberality among booksellers which formerly
characterised them? How freely had hundreds, nay thousands, been paid for
books; and surely books were then bought with as much avidity as formerly. He
would try again: it was to no purpose: and yet he knew not why. His former
publications had sold rapidly. The differ∣ence was they were written for
amusement: he now wrote for bread.</P>
<P>In this situation he was determined to have re∣course to his
old friend Ego, who, to eke out his poetry, enjoyed the comfortable
consolation of a snug annuity.</P>
<P> Ego was very glad to see Charles, and said, after shaking
him heartily by the hand, 
<Q REND="inline">'Ay, ay, I am the man to come to for advice. Who
have you ap∣plied to?'</Q> Charles told him to all the booksellers without
effect. 
<Q REND="inline">'Dam'me, that's a shame,' cried Ego; 'if I
were a bookseller, I would treat au∣thors with such liberality!'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'But as you are not, Mr. Ego,' said Charles,
'what would you ad∣vise me to do?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Faith I don't know,' said Ego, 
<PB N="142" REF="140"/> 'every body is neglected: would you think now a man of
my merit would lay dormant as I do?—Stay, zounds let me think—I am
the man for ex∣pedients. Have you any money left?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Not much I assure you,' said Charles.</Q>

<Q REND="inline">'Well, well, said Ego, it must be raised.
I have it: I am the man to serve my friends: it will make your for∣tune
better than bailiff's business. Lord, Mr. Hazard, how could you think of
being a merci∣ful bailiff! If I were a bailiff, I would be the cruelest
rascal that ever existed.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'And, in that case,' said Charles, 'you
would be more in cha∣racter than I was; but what is your expedient?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'I will tell you,' said Ego: 'you will laugh:
I am the man for making people laugh: I would have a new newspaper. There is
a plan!'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'A very good one,' said Charles, 'if a man had
a thou∣sand pounds to spare, and could stand in the con∣cern without
partners.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Yes, yes,' said Ego, 'but people must not,
now a-days, stand upon niceties. Do you know any thing of editing? I am the
man for an editor: I would have my pa∣per full of good essays: I would
stick to my party: I would maintain tooth and nail the principles of that
side I decidedly took. If it was the minis∣terial side, I would not, like
some papers I could name, creep, and cringe, and be fulsome. I would
chuse that part of their measures that could <PB N="143" REF="141"/> be
deduced from meritorious motives; for all conduct has its favourable sides.
In short, there is nothing but may be represented upon some principle or
other apparently worthy, without the wretched necessity of having
recourse to spatter and vilify others. On the contrary, if I decidedly took
up the part of opposition, I would expatiate on the noble passion of
patriotism, and let the ge∣nerous disinterested dictates of that glorious
in∣ducement tell generally against ministers, with∣out handing up their
names to the public, and call upon my countrymen to execrate them in the
lump.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Nobly distinguished,' said Charles, 'but
in my opinion, Mr. Ego, you are yet wide of the mark. Why take a decided part
at all, unless indeed the part of truth. What do you think of a paper that
should watch the impositions of all the rest; ex∣pose them to public
view; detect all their misre∣presentations; strip them alike of adulation
to ministers, and factious cavilling against them; expose the source
from whence the corruption flows which poisons public peace?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Zounds, the very thing in the world,' cried
Ego; 'and so not spare one's very brother, hey, as a body may say, if he
deserved to be treated severely; and, on the other side, shower down
encomiums upon the <PB N="144" REF="142"/> virtue of one's bitterest
enemies?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Exactly my idea,' cried Charles.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Zounds, give me your hand,' cried Ego. 'Why
don't you thank me for thinking of it? Well I do think I have the rea∣diest
brain. En't I the man for a scheme?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Yes,' said Charles, 'and I am the man for
improving upon it. For my part, I like it so well, that if you will
breakfast with me to-morrow morning, and consider the matter between this
and then, perhaps we may consolidate something that will be of mutual
advantage.'</Q></P>

<PB REF="143"/>
<HEAD>CHAPTER X.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>CONSISTING OF TEMPORIZING.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE reader will think it a little strange that Charles, who
had disdained to sue to Sir Sidney, should now seek out Ego, who, he
had been in∣formed, was one of those who did him ill offices with that very
gentleman. The fact is, that in the most consistent human heart there is
a sort of alloy, a kind of instability, which indeed, if it had not, our
being would imply a perfectness which it is universally allowed does not
fall to the lot of those bipeds called human beings.</P>
<P>Charles then raged with love more violently than ever:—for
I would not have my readers think that because I do not take up their whole
time in expa∣tiating upon his amorous vagaries, that he is only in love by fits
and starts, and at those times when I find it necessary to treat upon
that subject, by way of varying others. On the contrary, I desire it may be
understood that, let him appear how he <PB N="146" REF="144"/> may, he never
ceases to be in love with Annette, sleeping or waking—which indeed,
were it neces∣sary, I could shew under his hand, both in poetry and
prose—for one single minute, from the business of Aix la Chapelle
to the end of his life: nay, were I to antidate the business, and start
from the sum∣mer before he went to France, I dare say he might then boast
as large a portion of that passion, at least, as many who have declared,
ay, and sworn to it, that they were dying with it.</P>
<P>Oh this love! What will it not do? But I be∣lieve I may as well
leave rhapsody to those who have no necessity to attend to narrative,
and instead of saying what it will do, content myself with re∣cording
what it did.</P>
<P>I have mentioned our hero's detention of Mrs. Marlow, and his
motive for it, which I remember I had the good fortune to find perfectly
approved by the reader; for I saw him, in my mind's eye, smile as he read
the circumstance. Indeed Charles's partiality to her was such that, after
what has hap∣pened, it is almost a wonder his enemies had not by this time
made a handle of it to his disadvan∣tage; for, to say truth, while other
young men of his age and complexion were sacrificing to Bacchus and
Venus—let it be observed I do not mean As∣tarte—scouring 
<PB N="147" REF="145"/> the streets, and getting into broil, our
spiritless youth pored over a book, made a drawing, or set a sonnet:
all which amusements were only interrupted by the harmless prattle of an
old woman. Indeed he has often declared that he never passed moments of
more substantial pleasure than these with Mrs. Marlow.</P>
<P>To shew however that self can never be out of the question
with us, the subject of their conversation was nine-tenths of the
inducement. Charles had now heard nothing of Annette for several months, and,
in all that time, his love had nothing to feed on but the letter inserted in
the fourth chapter of this book. The more distant his prospects were of an
union with the idol of his soul, the more violent was his passion; for
this again is the nature of love. Nothing seems to be impossible to it in
theory, yet in practice it does not work miracles. He knew the soul of
Annette; he knew her incapable of change; he knew, if cruel fortune ravished
her hand, nothing could dispose of her heart: She had given it him: it was
his; indissolubly his. Then was there ever such a prodigy of fidelity and
zeal as Emma? No; he was secure. He could not more firmly rely on his own
resolution than theirs. No attachment was ever so sure, so grounded,
so permanent. What had he then to fear? Nothing <PB N="148" REF="146"/> from
love, but every thing from fortune. Sir Sid∣ney was more likely to be
implacable now he was rich, than when he was poor.</P>
<P>All this ground did he and Mrs. Marlow go over every evening of
their lives. Upon these occasions she would represent to him that
indeed he was not the kind of man to live in this world; that it would not do
upon all occasions to let the unqualified truth appear; that now a-days
people did not open their hearts every time they opened their mouths; and she
could plainly shew that all his miscarriages had been owing to
ingenuousness and honesty, which, as he would never find it in the
dealings of other men, so he might lay his account to its injuring him in all
his concerns. She said he loved the truth, and she knew he would thank her
for speaking it, and she would therefore tell him that she took the
liberty to disapprove his conduct in relation to Mr. Too∣good. He had
himself, it was true, shamefully abused those talents which he really
possessed, and had made them scandalously subservient to his
in∣terest; but if the world chose to be so imposed on, was any one
equal to the Herculean task of remov∣ing its prejudices. Mr. Toogood was in
possession of a very comfortable independency. This alone, in the
opinion of the world, would counteract all that could be said against him;
and this being the <PB N="149" REF="147"/> case, she did not wonder that his
conduct, worthy as it was, had been looked upon by one half of the world as
envy, and by the other as illnature. In short, Mr. Toogood, she said, had
it in his power to have served him, and it depended on himself whether he
was to make an unworthy use of ad∣vantages so procured.</P>
<P>Upon the same ground, if he had paid a visit to Musquito,
and given a little into his humour, he would doubtless have interested
himself with the academicians, and, as he was now a man of very great
consequence, there could not be a doubt but it would have turned out a matter
of profit to him.</P>
<P>As to the business of the theatre, it was certainly too
humiliating, and therefore he could not, in that instance, be too much
commended. But, in short, if he chose to get his bread by his talents, it
must be in the way others did it: there was no al∣ternative: and she had no
doubt, if he would seri∣ously lay himself out for eligible employ, but he
might yet acquire a fortune sufficient to satisfy Sir Sidney, who, she
was sure, would consider every guinea that was earned as twenty.</P>
<P>Convinced by these sort of arguments, our hero, 
<PB N="150" REF="148"/> as we have seen, lost no opportunity of trying his
ut∣most to get forward; and, having taken a great deal of trouble with the
booksellers to no purpose, he and Mrs. Marlow were one evening turning all
matters seriously in their minds, when she said, 
<Q REND="inline">'My dear sir, it is wonderful to me you have
never thought of getting about some real friend of Sir Sidney, and making him
your confidant. If it did nothing else, you would know from a channel of that
sort what were his private sentiments of you, and, among other matters, it
would furnish you with some particulars relative to Miss
Roe∣buck.'</Q></P>
<P>This last consideration bore down every other, and Mr.
Balance was thought by both the properest man in the world for this
purpose. He was how∣ever at that time out of town. 
<Q REND="inline">'But,' said Charles, 'a thought has struck
me, and it will convince you that I mean in future not to quarrel with people
quite so much for their vices. What do you think of Ego? I have told you all
his particularities, and really he has not very much prostituted his talents:
perhaps indeed because he has but few to prostitute; for the pension he
has was given him more from ostentation in the donor, than through any
servility in himself. Indeed he has too good an opinion of himself to be
very solici∣tous; <PB N="151" REF="149"/> for he takes as much care as he can
that, in all his affairs, Ego should be the first person.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'This is charming,' said Mrs. Marlow, and I
will warrant something comes of it; for, as he loves tittle tattle, he knows
of course all Sir Sid∣ney's family affairs, and it shall go hard but I will
worm some of them out of him: and so you see, without asking a single
question I shall get at every intelligence you wish to receive.</Q></P>
<P>It was then agreed that Ego should be sounded; but it was to
appear that our hero knew nothing of the business. Thus was the first
duplicity he ever practised occasioned by love. Indeed he could not live
any longer in this state of uncertainty; and if this method had not been hit
upon for the present relief of his anxiety, he certainly would have been put
upon playing some mad prank or other, which might have induced
concessions on his side, for which he never would have forgiven
himself.</P>
<P>On the other hand this business was a lucky hit for Mrs.
Marlow, who, just at that time, was upon the point of forging some sort
of intelligence, to soften the edge of our hero's unhappiness. It was now
however unnecessary; for as Charles was not to be supposed to know what
passed between her <PB N="152" REF="150"/> and Ego, so there would be no
occasion to relate more of their conversation than such parts of it as
would relieve his fears, which again, if they were not strong enough, might
admit of a little heighten∣ing; whereas, she resolved to sink whatever
would be likely to augment his chagrin: for she was not one of those
friends who unnecessarily aggravated matters, but, on the contrary,
admitted that a little laudable deceit was pardonable, when the proposed end
was meritorious.</P>
<P>Many good purposes, Mrs. Marlow flattered herself, would
derive from this commerce. Ego, she had no doubt, would retail what
passed in the presence of Emma, whose wit and ingenuity would not fail
to take hold of such an occasion to supply Charles with every thing he
wished to know, even, probably, without the conscious concurrence of Ego;
for it might be conveyed in such ambiguous terms as none but the lovers
themselves could un∣riddle; and, come what come might, she resolved to
invent consolation, where it really did not present itself, for she
could not bear the idea that our hero should be so afflicted.</P>
<P>This was the first time his obstinacy towards opening a
negociation with Sir Sidney seemed to give way. She hoped in time he would be
wholly <PB N="153" REF="151"/> subdued, and had no doubt when her
well-inten∣tioned scheme came to have the assistance of Mr. Balance,
that a perfect reconciliation would take place between them; and then, as it
was in the power of Sir Sidney alone to place our hero in a very conspicuous
professional light—which this foolish woman thought even more
eligible than the possession of an inherited fortune—she
contemplated, even with tears of joy, that moment when she should see him
happy, equal to his deserts.</P>
<P>Big with this project and these hopes, Mrs. Mar∣low waited
with impatience for the morning, and that she might employ her time to as
much advan∣tage as possible, entreated Charles to leave her for half an
hour with Ego, before he came down to breakfast.</P>
<P>Mr. Ego came very punctually to his time. He was shewn in by
Mrs. Marlow, who told him she was very sorry, but Mr. Hazard was a little
indis∣posed, and therefore she had not disturbed him; but, however, he
should be immediately called.—To which Mr. Ego made answer, 
<Q REND="inline">'Ah, up late last night I suppose: this is
the consequence: ah these young men! If I was a young man I would be the
mirror of sobriety.'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="152"/> 
<Q REND="inline">'Then,' said Mrs. Marlow, 'you would be
ex∣actly like Mr. Hazard, for I never saw him other∣wise than sober in my
life.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Indeed!' said Ego, 'I am glad on't: it is
very commendable. Always sober! Quite an altered man I suppose since he
came from France. It is a lamentable thing that young men cannot make the tour
of Europe without getting into so many scrapes. If I was to make the
tour—'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Sir,' said Mrs. Marlow, 'he only made the
tour of France, which I do not believe either you or any body else could have
done to better pur∣pose.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'There, my good lady, you must excuse me,'
cried Ego; 'the whole world rings of his shocking doings there. Why don't you
know he robbed a banker, knocked down his brother, stole a nun, spent her
fortune, turned sharper, killed a man, and then made his escape out of
prison?'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'No indeed I do not, nor does any body else,'
said Mrs. Marlow.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Nay but zounds madam,' returned Ego, 'you
must excuse me there: I am the man for knowing the truth of things.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'You are not the man for knowing the truth of
this,' <PB N="155" REF="153"/> said Mrs. Marlow, 'for every word of it is
false; and I dare say by false reports like these, which Mr. Hazard has
too much pride to contradict, Sir Sidney's ear has been abused, and he has
lost that good gentleman's confidence.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Faith,' said Ego, 'like enough, 'for there is
nothing like absence for injuring people in the opinion of their friends.
Yes, yes, I see how the thing has been: I am the man for seeing how the cat
wags her tail. And so it was all lies ha!'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Did not you see it at the time, Mr, Ego?'
said the good lady, 'since your penetration is so keen.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'See it,' said Ego, 'Oh yes I—that is to
say I had a glimpse, but that damned unmerciful teazer Musquito, and that
cursed lamenter of his friend's misfortunes, Toogood, would insist upon
it in such terms that you know I was obliged to run a little with the pack;
else you know what chance had I for a continuance of Sir Sidney's patronage?
Must mind the main chance you know, my good lady: I am the man for keeping a
friend,'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'That,' cried Mrs. Marlow, 'one may easily
see.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'But stop a little,' cried Ego, 'Can you
acquit him of this? Did he write one single word <PB N="156" REF="154"/> to
any individual soul?</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'And pray,' answered Mrs. Marlow, 'was there
no friend had charity enough to allow the possibility, at least, that his
letters had been intercepted; and, if that were the case, was it not also
possible that he who did him that injury, would not stop at
others?'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Gloss, Gloss.' cried Ego; 'zounds I see
it: I am the man for putting the saddle on the right horse. And yet do you
know he had the address always to appear Mr. Hazard's friend. But he has
such a way with him: sure, steady; never brought up the subject but
when he had made Sir Sidney charmed with himself, on account of some act of
generosity performed by the baronet himself, or his great grandfather. Yes,
yes, it is plain. He is a devil of a fellow to be sure.—Why he
bewitches people. Not that his praise of my poetry was any such great
matter: common fame does me justice: I am the man for poetry: but, the devil
of it is, who is this fellow that makes such a plaguy noise in the
world?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Who,' said Mrs. Marlow, 'a great man, a
member of parliament.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'A mighty great affair indeed,' cried Ego. 'In
your ear, if he was out of parlia∣ment he would be in the King's Bench.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'In∣deed!' cried Mrs. Marlow, pretending great
astonishment.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Owes seventy thousand pounds,' 
<PB N="157" REF="155"/> continued Ego; 'you may depend upon it from me: I am the
man for knowing how the world wags.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Well, but if this be the case,' cried Mrs.
Marlow, 'how is it possible that Sir Sidney can be so blinded as to
intend his marriage with Miss Roebuck?'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'I will tell you how that matter stands,'
said Ego. 'If the ministry goes out, and they say it totters at
present—for you see I am the man for being a bit of a
politician—if, do you mind me, they go out, Mr. Gloss will be a made
man, and then he will certainly marry Miss Roebuck.'—</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'With the young lady's consent, no doubt,'
said Mrs. Marlow.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Not a word of that,' said Ego: 'she will
obey, if you please, but never consent: I am the man for
distinctions.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'What has she any new lover then?' said Mrs.
Marlow, 'for surely she cannot have kept herself heart-whole for Mr.
Hazard, in the midst of such ceaseless persecutions, and against
so many reports to his disadvantage.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'My good lady,' said Ego, 'such truth,
such in∣nocence, such sweetness, such sense of duty as Miss
Roebuck possesses I have often read of, and indeed described, just
as one describes in poetry, sylphs, <PB N="158" REF="156"/> gnomes, or
flying dragons; children of fancy, offsprings of the imagination—I am the
man for a choice of words—in short a thing without literal existence,
but I confess I never saw it before.—Why I have seen her receive a
command from Sir Sidney with a smile, while her heart was bursting. In
short, she will become a voluntary sacrifice to her duty as soon as the
ministry changes.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'This then is the arrangement,' cried Mrs.
Marlow, 'and the poor lady and the nation are to turn about together.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Even so,' said Ego. 'I wish we could
say with truth that, in either case, turn about would be fair play: I am
the man for a pun.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'But pray,' said Mrs. Marlow, 'what part does
Mrs. Emma take?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Why that, that,' said Ego, 'is what I am
just now astonished at. Until very lately she had been a most
strenuous advocate for Mr. Hazard, but I think now we may call her the armed
neutrality. But, upon my word, my good lady, the young gentleman may thank
him∣self if his friends grow cool to him. Can any thing be so mad as the
way he has spent his mo∣ney? <PB N="159" REF="157"/> What the devil had he to
do with bailiffs, and charity, and beef, and bread? Nobody does it. So you
see his conduct is a satire upon the world, and now I only ask you, does
any body like to be satirized? I am the man that under∣stands propriety.
And then you see to brag of his actions, and try to depreciate the
benevolence of Sir Sidney, in his favourite scheme of Castle∣wick!'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Ay, has he done that?' said Mrs.
Marlow.—</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'It has lost him the baronet for ever, that's
all,' replied Ego. 'Now I would not have done that: I am the man that never
flies in any body's face.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'But I assure you Mr. Ego,' said Mrs.
Marlow, 'he had not done this.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'What,' said Ego, 'did not he boast of
having served more people in real distress in six months, than ever Sir
Sidney did in all his life?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Never,' said Mrs. Marlow, 'I will answer
for him.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'And did not he try to prove, by several
instances, that there was no sort of comparison in his charity and that
of the ba∣ronet?—for dam'me, said he, one day when he was
drunk—'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'But I tell you he never gets drunk,' said
Mrs. Marlow.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Well,' said Ego, 'sober then: so much the
worse: if he had been drunk he would have been excuseable. Dam'me, says
he—'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="158"/> Here Charles interrupted them. 
<Q REND="inline">'Ha! my good friend Hr. Hazard, I am glad you
are come: I want my breakfast devilishly: I am the man for the hot rolls
and butter. Here have this good lady and I been battling about you. Upon my
soul she is a strong advocate; a staunch friend: never saw such an
instance of attachment and fide∣lity. But, come, 'ent we to see
Miss?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Miss!' said Charles, 'what Miss?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Why Lord now how strange you make of it,'
said Ego; 'I mean the old gentlewoman's daughter: they tell me she is
temptingly handsome: I am the man that is a judge of beauty.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'I wish,' said Charles, 'you were a judge of
good manners. I gave you a hint yesterday that, if we were to be friends, you
must not attempt to glance at my actions in any way; for as I shall not
think it worth my while to ex∣plain my motives for what I really do, so I
give you warning you will not find me in a humour to pass calumny by
quietly.'</Q></P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XI.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>IN WHICH MATTERS SEEM TO DRAW NEARER TO A CRISIS.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>CHARLES having taken an opportunity during breakfast of going
out of the room, Mrs. Marlow begged Ego not to hint a single syllable of
the con∣versation that had passed between them. She said Mr. Hazard was
so tenacious of those resolutions he had taken of abiding by the truth of
his inten∣tions, without stooping to an explanation with any body, that she
was sure he would break off for ever with any friend who should be unwise
enough to stagger his determination; 
<Q REND="inline">'and as I am sure, Mr. Ego,' added she, 'he
has a regard for you, it would be pity you should lose one another's
friend∣ship in the moment of coming together.'</Q> She hinted also that
she should be glad to have some more private conversation with him, and
cunningly pretended to wonder what could have caused this alteration in Emma?
To which he answered he would learn the next day, if possible; for he was
<PB N="162" REF="160"/> to dine at Sir Sidney's: and added, 
<Q REND="inline">'Oh bless my heart—I am the man for
recollection—Mr. Fig∣gins is in town; pray has he called on Mr.
Ha∣zard?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'I fancy not,' said Mrs. Marlow, 'but
why?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Nay nothing,' replied Ego, 'only they say he
has been like the rest of the world—got it while it was going, hey, you
understand me: fools and their money—hey—I am the man for a
pro∣verb.'</Q> And then seeing Charles: 
<Q REND="inline">'but mum's the word: don't be afraid of
me.'</Q></P>
<P>After breakfast our hero and his friend Ego re∣sumed the
conversation of the day before, which they had both duly considered. Mr.
Ego said, that as far as his advice or interest went he was heart and hand
at Charles's service, but, as it was both unnecessary to his
circumstances, and improper at his time of life, he begged to be excused
from hav∣ing any immediate concern in it; 
<Q REND="inline">'for I am the man,' said he, 'that knows how
to take care of myself.'</Q></P>
<P>Charles, who was determined if he did any thing it should be
solely his own concern, did not dislike this declaration, and after some
further consul∣tation, it was agreed that about eight hundred pounds was
enough to start the paper: two hun∣dred of which our hero could muster, and
it was <PB N="163" REF="161"/> proposed to raise the rest by shares of
fifty pounds each. In short, Ego, in company with Charles, beat up the
quarters of all those who, from disap∣pointment, an adventurous spirit,
or other motives, were likely to come into it; and, after several meetings,
many regulations, and other <HI>pro</HI> and <HI>con,</HI> it was at length
agreed that Charles should be the sole conductor of the paper, have four
shares for his two hundred pounds, and a salary of two hun∣dred a year:
but, as its failure, if it did not suc∣ceed, must naturally be attributed
to his want of abilities to conduct it, he should be obliged, on its being
proved to be a losing game every day for a fortnight together, to take all
their shares back at the original price; and, on the other hand, if it
succeeded beyond expectation, he should be made a proportionable
amends.</P>
<P>These terms were extremely well relished, and our hero took
the field as generalissimo of diurnal criticism. He detected the fallacy
of other papers, reprobated their venality, resuted their arguments, and
shewed the futility of all their proceedings; and, though the concern
sustained a loss almost every day, the world's eyes began to be opened,
and probably the matter would have been hand∣somely taken up, if internal
divisions had not con∣vulsed the whole plan. The fact was this: four of 
<PB N="164" REF="162"/> the other papers had each sent a purchaser of a
share, whose instructions were to kindle as much strife as possible
among the partners. Thus, upon separate grounds, they began to split this
little community into factions. One said a newspaper was not worth a
farthing that did not take a decided part; another that they ought to have
secured advertisements be∣fore they had started; a third was beginning,
when our hero begged leave to remark that no partner had a right to interfere
with the conduct of the paper. Let him then take up the shares, according to
his agreement, was the answer. His was imme∣diately at his service. Charles
now too late saw the drift of this. He said if he had known he had
em∣barked with a set of men who were afraid of a little risk, he would have
set his face to the business alone at first; but he was willing
nevertheless to abide by all his agreement. He had certainly ran himself
out of ready cash, but if any gentlema would take his note, at a short
date, for the amount of his share it was heartily at his service. Three
took him at his word, at that meeting, and, by a week afterwards, he was left
with but four part∣ners.</P>
<P>Had the paper been dealt by honestly, it would have done
wonders; but the proprietors of the rest, who had not the courage to defend
their measures <PB N="165" REF="163"/> openly—for indeed they were
indefensible—tam∣pered with the news-carriers, and were guilty of a
thousand other paltry shifts and tricks, to prevent its circulation. They
also brided the printer to insert such words as rendered the writing
nonsense, after the correction of the last proof, and when it was
impossible to prevent its going in that state into the world.</P>
<P>There was a dirtiness in these proceedings which Charles
could not stoop to a detection of. He doubled his satire, and they their
arts, till at length every partner had begged to be off, and he was left alone
to stem the torrent. He now found himself playing at a losing game,
almost exhausted of all his cash, and engaged for the payment of six
hun∣dred pounds; so that, driven into every possible corner, he was
compelled to send this scheme after the rest, and sell the materials
for a supply.</P>
<P>Now it was that Charles discovered who had been his partners
in the paper; for, their end being answered, they published his disgrace
in the most triumphant language their virulent and low male∣volence could
suggest. They recapitulated all his former miscarriages, gave an
invidious turn to his whole conduct, misrepresented him in regard to his
opera, and warned the public how it encouraged a <PB N="166" REF="164"/> man
who, instead of being avowedly its servant, had the arrogant presumption
to set up a standard of taste, and the vanity to suppose that all the
world must bow to his <HI>ipse dixit.</HI></P>
<P>Charles avoided, with every possible industry, all chance
of getting into a personal quarrel upon this occasion; knowing that he
could reap no honour from a contention with men of no character, and that they
would, in their report of him, so per∣vert his motives of resentment, as to
throw a public stigma on him, let his conduct be ever so
right.—Indeed his notions upon this subject were a little heteroclite,
for he maintained that duelling was not only a very barbarous, but a very
dishonourable custom, and that it served more to assist the views
of cowards and assassins, than to support the dig∣nity of such as
possessed true courage.</P>
<P>In defence of this opinion, he certainly advanced a great deal
of persuasive reasoning, which unfortu∣nately nobody listened to; for
people, however they break through established customs—whether by
stealing your purse, or your peace of mind, or cutting your
throat—never appear publicly to dis∣approve of them.</P>
<P>This very opinion was taken advantage of by 
<PB N="167" REF="165"/> Gloss, who negociated a quarrel so well, that our
hero received a challenge from a rascal, and refused to meet him. His
pusillanimity was immediately the public topic, and though he was a short
time after under the unpleasant necessity of kicking the fellow out of a
coffee-house who had had the im∣pudence to traduce him, yet, in the next
company he went he scarcely was spoken to.</P>
<P>Charles, securely wrapt up in his own conscious honour,
certainly held all this in ineffable con∣tempt; yet fearing lest accumulated
provocation should induce him to depart from that forbearance which his
rectitude had pointed out in his case to be necessary, he wisely
resolved to read none of the abuse written against him, lest he
should be pro∣voked into a reply that would make his competi∣tors of more
consequence than he wished. He re∣lied on the candour of the public for a
tacit refuta∣tion of all calumny whatsoever, and, instead of in∣volving
himself in more troubles, began seriously to consider how he could get
rid of those with which he was already surrounded.</P>
<P>He had about seventy pounds, and the furniture of his house,
which was decent and convenient, but no more. The earliest of his notes was
within five days of being due, and a fortnight more would bring 
<PB N="168" REF="166"/> the rest upon his back; in consequence of which, all
the horrors of a prison, and the merciless severity of bailiffs, who owed
him so much ill will, would be inevitable.</P>
<P>To avoid these unpleasant circumstances, he re∣solved to
go to France, which determination how∣ever he imparted to nobody but his
faithful house∣keeper, whose success had been upon a par with his; for
Ego had brought her intelligence that there was no knowing what to make of
Emma, that the ministry was changed, and Mr. Gloss now filled a high and
conspicuous situation, and, in short, that every thing in that quarter
menaced our hero's affairs with ruin and total destruction.</P>
<P>Though Mrs. Marlow, when she had fancied things wore a
brighter complexion, had deter∣mined to put the best face on the matter to
Charles, finding them in this desperate way, she saw there was no time
for trifling. Besides, Mr. Gloss's situation was a public town talk, and
all the rest would be known of course. Indeed the good crea∣ture could not
dissemble; her very heart spoke in her eyes, and he saw his
wretchedness before she uttered a syllable.</P>
<P>Another circumstance greatly perplexed Charles, 
<PB N="169" REF="167"/> and made him wish to seclude himself from all the
world. Mr. Figgins had certainly been in town, but had not called upon him.
Indeed a mystery had hung over that gentleman's conduct for some time. When
Charles conferred on him the annuity, he received a letter thanking him in
terms of such enthusiastic warmth, that he thought it a little
over∣strained, and some suspicious matters had since in∣duced him to
believe that his old friend, finding he had got all he could, now turned his
back upon him, which the reader, no more than Charles, will think an
extraordinary conjecture. But what were now his sensations, when he found,
beyond all doubt, that this very friend who had sworn so hear∣tily never to
desert his interest, who knew all the secrets of his soul, who, in
short, had more power than any man in the world to shew his enemies how to
take advantage of him, had gone over to Mr. Gloss.</P>
<P>Charles had all his life wanted a friend; he had been very often
plunged in misfortune, but this was the first time that he saw himself on
the brink of actual poverty, without a single resource. The brute
Musquito was master of an ample fortune, the pliant Toogood had a
profitable place, and even that echo of his own praise, Ego, had sat
himself <PB N="170" REF="168"/> down comfortably. These men had nothing for
which they ought to be rewarded, but much that merited reprehension; while
he, whose whole study had been to benefit the public, who had, in spight
of all the malignity that had overwhelmed him, the testimony of hundreds to
the purity of his in∣tentions, which had been evinced by a strong worldly
proof—no less than throwing down some thousands in the
prosecution of his laudable plan—he, in an early period of life, must
now learn the bitter task of bearing distress, and yielding to actual
want.</P>
<P>Charles, however, happened to have a mind not easily to be
broken. 
<Q REND="inline">'Come Mrs. Marlow,' said he, as they talked
over his affairs, 'let us set our faces to the weather. They think that under
such accumulated misfortunes I shall sink, and they will get rid of me;
and indeed were I not of a different temper from any other man, it would be
so: but I am not of a mind to indulge my ene∣mies: we must not lie down in
this world for want of resources; and, I thank God, my ima∣gination flatters
me I shall not be to seek for them, even though experience should, as
usual, destroy all my hopes upon proof. At present certainly this kingdom
is no place for me, and it has struck me that, by quitting it, I can not only
<PB N="171" REF="169"/> turn my pursuits to advantage, but in that very way
that, had I not been a fool, I should all along have preferred to the
straight forward reproba∣tion of duplicity, by which the world's good opinion
is not to be gained. In short, I will tell you what I will do. I will get
into Flanders, seat myself in an obscure lodging, and copy every thing I
can lay my hands upon. HOLBEIN, or HEMSKIRK, TENIERS, or HOBIMA, WYNANTS, or
VANDERVELDT; nothing shall come amiss to me; and when I have stocked
myself with a suf∣ficient collection, properly smoaked, varnished, and
mutilated, they shall be put up to auction in the English metropolis, as
the collection of a gen∣tleman who died upon his travels.'</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Marlow declared she had now some hopes of him, and
begged he would set about it imme∣diately.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'I will,' said Charles, with a profound
sigh, 'and yet it is very hard to be cut off from every hope. I could have
borne any thing, every thing, sustained torture, and called it pleasure,
could I still have flattered myself with the hopes of ob∣taining Annette.
Oh let no man place his hap∣piness on the promises of a woman. I could have
endured misery, beggary for her. Want and all <PB N="172" REF="170"/> its grim
train, should have been my welcome companions. I would have blessed the
moment that made me wretched to prove my love. But, come, no weakness; let me
feel, but not mur∣mur; let me, since there is nothing else with which I can
reproach myself, so forget the dig∣nity of my love as to reproach her. No,
however she may excel me in happiness and fortune, she never shall be
my superior in truth and honour.'</Q></P>

<PB REF="171"/>
<HEAD>CHAPTER XII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>CONTAINS, AMONG OTHER THINGS, A VERY UNEXPECTED VISIT.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>EVERY invention having been exhausted to ward off the coming
blow, without success, Charles be∣gan in earnest to think of retiring to
the continent: to which he was not a little stimulated by his new scheme.
He was so closely pressed, that he was obliged to decamp in the middle
of the night; for he had heard, that very morning, that a writ had been
obtained against him, from one of his most invete∣rate enemies—though
the note o which account it was issued was not due—upon a pretence
that it was his intention to leave the kingdom.</P>
<P>It was eleven o'clock in the night that this scheme was to be
put in execution. Our hero had just supped, and spoken these parting
words to Mrs. Marlow. 
<Q REND="inline">'Since I have lost every friend upon earth but
you; since, in this country, men of ho∣nest principles cannot flourish;
since my love and honour have been equally betrayed, and every 
<PB N="174" REF="172"/> worthy effort to gain the world's esteem and se∣cure
a faithful return to my hopeless affection has been attended with nothing but
ingratitude, shame, and disappointment, I go to find a little
recollec∣tion, and to shake off this strange dream of fruit∣less
expectation in another country; and, since I have found to my mortification
that here the whole world lives in a happy delirium, and en∣joys no pleasure
but through the medium of be∣ing cheated by their own consent, I will one day
or other return and administer to their amusement in the only way any man
can hope for success: the honesty of which I now fairly subscribe to;
for how can it be said that people are imposed upon when they consent to
the deception. Hav∣ing made, by means like these, a competency, you and I, my
dear Marlow, will retire to some snug retreat, where, as at a comedy, we
will look at the world, and laugh, but never venture again to have any thing to
do with it, otherwise than as spectators, for fear of the humiliation that,
as ac∣tors, we should be sure to meet with.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'These are strange declarations in so
young a man, but they are perfectly reasonable, perfectly honest, and I can
set the point I aim at within my view as easily as Mr. Gloss, though
perhaps I may not attain it by means so rascally. And now 
<PB N="175" REF="173"/> my good, my kind friend, adieu. There is an
in∣strument by which the furniture of this house is become yours. It is a
poor present, but per∣haps it may assist you, through the medium of
letting lodgings, to eke out the little I may be able to send you. At
present I can very well spare you forty pounds, and, that you may not have
a word to say in reply, I promise you, if I should be in necessity, I
will as freely have re∣course to you.'</Q></P>
<P>Charles then ran over all his former schemes, and shewed in
what instances he would make them serve as a warning as to his future
intentions, which he had strenuously at heart, and through which he doubted
not he should one day be able to shew how greatly he could be independant,
with barely a com∣petency. He spoke of the treachery of Figgins, but still
attributed that, as well as every other mis∣fortune, to his own stupid
credulity alone; for that he ought to have known what a world he lived in, and
not have suffered himself to be imposed upon. 
<Q REND="inline">'And yet,' said he, 'my dear Mrs. Marlow,
there is a circumstance that I must complain of, though it is taxing
perfection, arraigning heaven itself! But this is not the time to awaken any
feeling; to stagger my resolution. Still I would wish you to see that
false, that lovely creature; to see <PB N="176" REF="174"/> Emma too. Do not
however upbraid either of them. Let them only know that they imposed upon a
heart that deserved better of them; that it shall break, misery shall
dissolve it, torture tear it, before it shall consent to a single
murmur, though but a whisper. Tell my Annette to be happy; to be supremely
blest, without an in∣truding care; and to think that I am too fortu∣nate if I
have secured her happiness at so trifling an expence as the loss of my
peace. Tell her—but indeed it is dreadful; I cannot at present bear the
conflict, and I must—heavenly powers!—but come, let me be a man,
and keep my senses.'</Q></P>
<P>At these words he reclined against the wainscot, with one
hand on his forehead, the other on his heart, and his eyes turned upwards, as
if imploring those powers which, if we may judge of what im∣mediately
followed, were as deaf to his calls as the hearts of his pretended friends had
been to the calls of honour.</P>
<P>As he stood in this attitude, and as Mrs. Marlow contemplated
him with ineffable complacency, and tender sorrow, a loud knocking was heard
at the door. What could it be? At that time of night too! Certainly Charles's
enemies had been apprized of his intentions, and were determined to prevent 
<PB N="177" REF="175"/> his escape. 
<Q REND="inline">'Lord,' cried Mrs. Marlow, 'what shall we
do?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Do,' said Charles, 'why if they will have me,
I must submit to it.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Not for the world,' said Mrs. Marlow. 'For
God's sake, my dear sir, go up stairs: pretty high if you please: and
if you find it is any thing of that sort, fairly go out of the garret window,
and creep on three doors farther, to Mr. Lott's.—You can easily get
along the gutter, and, after the coast is clear, I will go to Mr. Lott's,
apprize them of the truth, and you shall stay there till a proper
time.'</Q></P>
<P>Charles made some objections to Mrs. Marlow's expedient, but a
second thundering at the door overruled them. And now Mrs. Marlow went boldly
to demand who it was that paid them this unseasonable visit.</P>
<P>Before she would open the door, she called to know who was
there. She was answered by a postillion—for she could see his
dress and his whip through the key hole, by the light of the lamp—that
there were some of Mr. Hazard's friends out of the country, in a chaise,
who must see him even at that time of night.</P>
<P>Mrs. Marlow, overjoyed with the hopes that her 
<PB N="178" REF="176"/> friend's affairs might have taken some favourable
turn, and, at any rate, guarded as we have seen against sinister
consequences, made no scruple of opening the door, which she had no
sooner done than two men handed a lady out of a chaise, and all together
came within the door: one of the gen∣tlemen desiring the lady might be
shewn into a room. This Mrs. Marlow, who was greatly struck with the lady's
uncommon beauty, scrupled not to do; after which, one of the gentlemen,
tak∣ing her aside, begged Mr. Hazard would come to them immediately, for that
the lady was Miss Roe∣buck.</P>
<P>At these words Mrs. Marlow flew up stairs, and, in less
than a minute, introduced our hero, first hav∣ing informed him that she
would bring him to a friend whose presence would make him ample amends for
all his former troubles, but who that friend could be, in spight of all his
entreaties, she left him to guess.</P>
<P>If our hero's faculties were upon the stretch, to find who
this extraordinary friend could be, who, contrary to the hard customs of the
times, had ge∣nerously sought the dwelling of the unfortunate, what was his
excessive astonishment when a gleam that had started across his
suspended thoughts, just <PB N="179" REF="177"/> as he arrived at the
door, was presently realized by the sight of her who held his captive
soul, who now sat in the very chair out of which, ten minutes before, he
had himself risen.</P>
<P> He started much more naturally than I have seen a hero on
the stage at the sight of a ghost, and ex∣claimed, 
<Q REND="inline">'Heavens and earth! Am I awake? Is it
possible that the divine Annette—'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'No sir,' exclaimed the lady, with great
anger, 'it is not possible that she can come any where, by her own
consent, into your presence, unless to tell you how much she disdains
your low arts.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'For God's sake madam,' cried Charles, in an
agony, 'what do you mean? Am I to be every way tortured? Is my whole life to be
a dream? Am I to comprehend nothing?'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Admirably acted,' said the lady; 'I wanted
but this to be convinced.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Convinced of what, ma∣dam?' cried Charles'
'that my existence, my very soul is in your power, and therefore you can
tor∣ture it at will.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'For shame,' cried Annette, 'I only want to
ask you one question. Do you think, by this <PB N="180" REF="178"/> violent
conduct, to accomplish your wishes. Do you not think by it that you have,
and with rea∣son, lost my father for ever.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'I know I have lost him, madam,' cried
Charles; 'I was told too I had lost you; and now, lest I should doubt the
truth of my being completely miserable, you are condescending enough to put
me entirely out of pain, by confirming it with your own mouth: in this
extraordinary manner too, at this unseasonable hour.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Wretch,' cried Annette, 'can you pretend to
charge me with what you have caused yourself? Is not the whole your own
doing? Has not your unhappy impetuosity undone you? And now, instead of
defending yourself, you are determined I shall be no more out of doubt than
the rest. In short, I am convinced that it is impossible to be on terms
with you, and I declare to you, in so many words—though I will not so
falsify my character as to say it does not pain me to make the
effort—I will never be yours.'</Q></P>
<P>As this moment, as if in a violent flurry, in rushed Mr.
Gloss. 
<Q REND="inline">'And here,' cried Charles, 'is the happy man who
is to witness my disgrace, and triumph over me; but, by all that is
sacred, <PB N="181" REF="179"/> he shall not live to enjoy this happiness;
for this hand—'</Q></P>
<P>Saying this, he ran to his pistols, which he had loaded to
take with him, at which both Annette and Mrs. Marlow screamed. Mr. Gloss
told them not to be afraid; adding, with a sneer, that no harm would happen,
which probably he knew, for another person who then entered the room caught
hold of Charles's arm, and proclaimed aloud that he had an action against
him.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Then all is over,' said Charles,</Q> and
dropt into a chair. Annette, at this moment, was not in a better condition.
Lest however she should discover her confusion to Charles, she
begged Mr. Gloss would conduct her home, declaring she felt herself
greatly indisposed.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'I don't doubt it, madam,' said Mr.
Gloss:—'the gentleman however shall smart for it. You triumphed
sir,' said he, 'when last this lady was in danger; now I think it is my
turn.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Thine!' cried Charles, starting from his
re∣verie. 'Worm! Reptile! Thy turn to triumph over me! But I thank you madam,'
said he to Annette. 'It is plain you wanted an excuse in the 
<PB N="182" REF="180"/> opinion of the world for the most inexcuseable trait
of falshood and levity that ever disgraced your sex; and I may say now
that <HI>you</HI> have well acted your part: and so madam adieu. There is yet
time, before you sleep, to glut the ear of your father with the information
that my downfal is completed. And now sir,' said he to the man who had
arrested him, 'I am ready for you.'</Q>—Saying these words, he
snatched up his hat, and left first the room, and then the house, in
company with the bailiff and his follower.</P>
<P> The moment Charles had walked off, as we have described,
Annette cried out, 
<Q REND="inline">'Oh, Mr. Gloss, I am very ill,'</Q> and fell
lifeless on the floor. Mrs. Marlow was not idle: she produced some drops,
which revived her in the course of a few minutes; but it must be
confessed that good old lady's atten∣tion was of a very chequered kind; for
though hu∣manity had obliged her to pay Annette every possi∣ble respect
in her then situation, yet her heart bled for the sufferings of poor
Charles, to which she could not help thinking that Mr. Gloss, at least,
had contributed, by this last unmanly business of the arrest, which
she was induced to believe he had connived at through cowardice: lest, had
our hero fair play, he must have answered to him this trea∣chery, and that
very severely.</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="181"/> Under this idea, when Annette came to
herself, Mrs. Marlow did not spare to exclaim against the scandalous
conduct of those who had, she said, by spreading the most infamous
and injurious calumny, wounded the character of a young gentleman, who had no
equal in the world.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'I believe so,' said Gloss, with an
invidious leer, 'for egregious folly, intolerable pride, and un∣bounded
profligacy. But come madam,' said he to Annette, 'I believe there is a coach
at the door, and we want no advice from this good lady, who of course is
partial to him whose bread she eats.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'I do eat his bread,' cried Mrs. Marlow, 'and
heaven is my witness I would not eat it if I did not know him to be what I
say. I know he is the worthiest, best, gentlest, noblest creature
that ever did honour to human nature. I know his soul is above every thing
that is ungenerous or unjust. I know, in short, he is the very reverse of
you, from whom I have not been able to take off my eyes ever since you came
into the room; and I will tell you why: I look on you with horror, and believe
you capable of every thing horrid and infamous; for you are the very picture of
a man whom I knew to be the most villainous and despicable upon
earth.'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="184" REF="182"/> 
<Q REND="inline">'I am much obliged to you madam,' said Mr
Gloss, 'for your eulogium; and now I believe we have no further business
here.'</Q> So saying, he gave his hand to Annette, who had been drowned in
tears for some minutes, and who now retired with her protector, as he called
himself, without the power of paying her acknowledgments to Mrs. Mar∣low so
warmly as the case required, or her wishes prompted her.</P>

PER∣PLEXITIES ARE REGULARLY WROUGHT UP, AND COM∣PLETELY UNRAVELLED.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAPTER I.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>IN WHICH THE READER WILL FIND MUCH MORE THAN HE EXPECTED,</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>A MOST miserable night did poor Mrs. Marlow pass in our
hero's absence. She did not know where he was gone, or by what means to get
any tidings of him. In this exigence she would have waited on Mr. Balance, a
step which she repented she had not taken before—but as all her
cogitations terminated in a resolution to adopt no active mea∣sure of her
own head, lest she should injure him she <PB N="186" REF="184"/>
wished to serve, she even sat herself down quietly, and waited with
the most tantalizing impatience <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ill, by hearing from him, she should be released
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>om her anxiety.</P>
<P>Under these circumstances had she remained, like a timid
hare in her form, dreading she knew not what, till about two o'clock the next
day, when she heard as violent a thundering at the door as she had heard
the night before. She immediately flew to the door, and let in not our hero,
but a gentleman who said Mr. Hazard must be found, if he was above ground,
for that his brother lay at the point of death, and that he was come post
haste from the country, to consult him on some family matters, which were
of the last importance.</P>
<P>Mrs. Marlow begged his pardon, but could not conceive in what
way Lord Hazard's death could possibly affect his brother: that nobleman,
she fancied, had nothing but the title and estate to give, and those
would of course go to his infant son, who, she supposed, was not
lying at the point of death. As to any legacies, she did not believe his
lordship had lived so frugal as to have any to leave; and, were not this
the case, she could not be inclined to think his good will towards his
brother extended <PB N="187" REF="185"/> so far as to have induced him to do
any thing in his favour.</P>
<P>The stranger said she was perfectly right, but yet his
business with him was of a particular nature.—In short, neither
could make any thing of the other: what the strangers sentiments were we
shall see.</P>
<P>As to Mrs. Marlow, she thought this chicken was of the same
brood with the rest, and that he only wanted to get out of her what he could,
per∣haps to lay a detainer against Charles, or for some other purpose
equally inimical.</P>
<P>At the end of four days—for till then had this poor
friendly creature been tormented with alter∣nate hopes and fears—she
received a letter, by the post, on which she was astonished to see
the post∣mark Ostend, but her astonishment was still high∣tened by
noticing the hand writing of her friend and benefactor. This was the letter. 
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To Mrs. MARLOW, AT —.</HEAD>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>MY DEAR MRS. MARLOW,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P> As I know you must be under the most torturing state
of anxiety upon my account, I <PB N="188" REF="186"/> take the very earliest
opportunity of relieving you from it, by informing you by what means I am able
to date a letter from this place.</P>
<P> Sensibly as I felt at leaving that false deluded
creature in the hands of her betrayer and mine, I had no sooner got into the
street, than I began to think my pecuniary affairs, at that moment, de∣manded
my first attention. I therefore prevailed upon the bailiff to accompany me to
a tavern, rather than to any house of security, that, if pos∣sible, I
might hit upon some terms of accommo∣dation. This, after a short
hesitation, he con∣sented to. There, while I plied him with wine, a thought
struck me that this should be my first attempt at imposition, which I
the less hesitated at, as the fellow was a notorious rascal. This
stroke, as it has been attended with success, I have no doubt but I
shall hereafter follow it up with others, till our competency will be
secure, and then I promise you not all the Annettes upon earth shall draw
from me a single sigh.</P>
<P> I begged his patient attention to what I was go∣ing to
say. I then told him that when I was last in France I fell in love with a
young lady of con∣siderable merit and fortune, who would, without reluctance,
give me her hand, as soon as I should <PB N="189" REF="187"/> arrive on the
continent; that the amour in ques∣tion had created a jealousy in the young
lady he had seen; and that I was very sure the business of the writ had
been connived at with a view of keep∣ing me from quitting the kingdom; that I
would, to come to the point, make him all the amends in my power, if he would,
in any way, suffer me to escape.</P>
<P> To my great surprise—for I did not think this
would half do with him—he appeared willing to treat, and, in short,
after many scruples—such as that he should certainly have the whole
debt and costs to pay, and others equally cogent—he agreed, late as it
was, to knock up two of his friends, to be bail for me, who, to make short of
the story, appeared, and I gave a bond among them, to pay a hundred pounds
when I should return to En∣gland, provided that event took place in three
months; a hundred and fifty if it exceeded six; and double that sum if I
returned a married man.</P>
<P> As I know these fellows to be as voracious as pikes, you
may easily guess I lost not a moment in making the best use of my
time. Thus, of course, I did not come home, nor would I trust myself to
write to you till I touched this ground, <PB N="190" REF="188"/> lest my next
letter should be worse to you than the suspence I know you have kindly
felt, by giving you an account of a second loss of liberty.</P>
<P> I shall wait in this place a week; I beg there∣fore you
will write the moment you receive this, and I charge you, as you value truth
and my friendship, qualify nothing; let me have the sim∣ple undisguised
matter of fact; particularly as to Annette. If she consent to marry that
rascal Gloss, though my first feelings will be a wish to come to
England, purposely to cut her husband's ears off, my second, which will
very soon suc∣ceed the other, will settle all other considerations into
contempt, and then I shall be in such a frame of mind as to make me
obliterate a set of people from my memory, in whom I have been mistaken.
Surely this will be moderate enough.</P>
<P> As soon as I get your letter, and have delibe∣rated a
little on my present affairs, I shall endea∣vour to get among the Flemings.
Pray do not let a single soul at present know where I am. This country is
not so safe as France. You will find enclosed the forty pounds which our
extraordi∣nary visitants prevented me from giving you. I have no present
occasion for it, and you can lay part of it out to advantage in decorating my
old <PB N="191" REF="189"/> apartments, for the accommodation of lodgers. If in
that, or any way, they can be turned to your advantage, it will give me more
pleasure than it possibly could to occupy them myself; but re∣member, I
charge you not to attempt returning this money, or any thing similar to it,
for I de∣clare most solemnly, if you do, I will not let you know my route;
in which case your intention will be defeated: for, beside the hazard, I
can in that case return what you send; whereas you will be deprived of a
similar advantage. At the same time, to make you perfectly easy, I will
permit you to do what you can for me, if I should be in actual
necessity.</P>
<P> You see, my dear Mrs. Marlow, I must still be proud;
but ought not a man to be so who is determined to impose upon all the
world? He ought to be a clever fellow, and therefore should be proud. In
truth, one should not laugh at this, for I cannot conceive a more melancholy
reflec∣tion than that the intellects of mankind are so very slender, so
filmy, such a perfect cobweb, that nothing in nature is so easy as to
dupe these lords of the creation, through their own conni∣vance.</P>
<P> Adieu: write immediately, directed to the 
<PB N="192" REF="190"/> post office, but do not, upon any account, ven∣ture a
second letter till I have answered the first. Another thing remember: put
all letters into the post yourself. My whole downfal among the Roebucks is
imputable, you know, to intercepted letters; though they, poor dupes—is
it not true that people are easily duped?—do not even yet believe
it.</P>

HAZARD.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER></P>
<P>As I mean now to watch our hero's progress for some time,
which, by the bye, is but fair—as he is deserted by every other
friend—I shall say, at pre∣sent, that nothing of any consequence
happened to him at Ostend, but the receipt of the following letter, from Mrs.
Marlow, in answer to the pre∣ceding one. 
<LETTER>
<HEAD>TO CHARLES HAZARD ESQ.</HEAD>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>WORTHY SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P> Before I received your letter, I had ga∣thered a great deal
of news for you. God be praised that you are in a place of safety. Here I 
<PB N="193" REF="191"/> believe the people are all mad. The madest of them is
her you and I, a month ago, would have sworn was not to be changed. In
short, what signifies hiding it, Miss Roebuck that was, is now Mrs.
Gloss. I have seen her myself, and spoken to her; but indeed I am so
flurried I don't know where to begin first. They have made me mad among them,
but I have left off writing to cry a little, and now I shall have patience to
tell you every thing in form.</P>
<P> You must know, the day after you left the house, a
gentleman came in a violent hurry, with a strange story, that your brother
lay at the point of death; but I took him for some enemy, and so sent him
away with a flea in his ear. I have been vexed at it ever since, for the news
about his pre∣cious lordship is true: nay, it is now reported he is dead. But
what is this to you? You know sir there are two infant Lord Hazards in being.
When he comes next however I shan't snap him up so short.</P>
<P> You are to understand that your brother's ill∣ness was
occasioned by an accident when he was hunting. His horse plunged into a
river, and he, for some time, was so entangled in the stir∣rups, 
<PB N="194" REF="192"/> that he had like to have been drowned:—but you
saved him from the other fate in France, and his good stars from this in
England. As he was however sometime in his wet clothes, and—being half
tipsy—would, pig like, insist upon not changing them—saying
that nothing ever hurt an English sportsman in the chase—he was
taken the next day very ill, and, as I said before, the re∣port now is that
he is dead.</P>
<P> So much for him: God bless him, and send him better off
in the other world than he wished people to be in this.</P>
<P> My next visitor was Mr. Ego, who, with a long face, and I
think real concern—but there is no knowing any body—told me that
Miss Roe∣buck had certainly consented to have Mr. Gloss; that the wedding
clothes were bespoke, the li∣cence purchased, and the day fixed.</P>
<P> I thought it now high time I should begin to look about
me, and so put on my hat and cloak, and went directly to Sir Sidney's
house. I saw both Miss and her very good, her very wise friend, Mrs.
Emma, who has been bribed over to Gloss's side, or I will never pretend to
judge of any thing again. Well I only begged to know from the 
<PB N="195" REF="193"/> young lady's mouth whether the report I had heard was
true. She said it was. I asked if it was true that the wedding cloaths were
bespoke? Yes was the answer again. If the licence was ready? Yes. And when
was the happy day to be? The next day but one. And now, said Mrs. Emma,
putting in her word, you may carry this information to your friend, and tell
him—</P>
<P> Here she repeated some nonsense from a book, that I
cannot remember; but it was something about taking your enemy in their arms.
To make short of it, I came away. The appointed day was yesterday, and I
have this morning, with my own eyes, seen an account of the wedding in the
newspapers.</P>
<P> There—there is your tender, constant, Miss
Annette for you! And now I can only say if it makes you uneasy one hour,
you are not the man of sense I take you for. What the deuce are these
people to plot together, and creep, and fetch, and carry, and destroy the
health and peace of a young gentleman twenty times their betters?—for he,
let them think as they please, would not break his word, no that he would
not, for the world. I'll assure them! What would they have next? But I am
getting mad with them again. <PB N="196" REF="194"/> Oh my dear sir, how I
would be revenged if I was you. I wish the story was true that you told
that nasty fellow, with all my heart. I some∣times think it is, only that
the lady fell in love with you, for that is more likely; and, if she had, I
am sure you would have more honour than to tell. If it is true, do, dear
sir, marry her, if only to spite them.</P>
<P> I don't know what else to say. As to the forty pounds,
you have stopt my mouth: it is hard however that you will be so very proud.
Lord how could you write about decorating your apart∣ments for any body else?
A king could not de∣serve to have them so handsome as yourself. I
as∣sure you if I had not cried heartily I don't know what I should have
done with myself when I came to that part of your letter.</P>
<P> God bless you sir, and send you as happy as you
deserve to be, and then you will be much happier than any of your Annettes
could have made you. I have not patience with them. But come sir, keep up
your spirits, for something tells me all is for the best. Go things how
they will, you are sure of one true friend: for I will work my fingers to the
bone for you.</P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="195"/> Remember your promise, that if you
should want you will apply to me. But why do I say remember your promise?
Did you ever forget a promise? Besides, you know you are not to cheat me,
though you do all the world. I wish all the world had not so cheated
you.</P>
<CLOSER>
<SIGNED>Your most grateful friend, And humble servant, E.
MARLOW.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER></P>
<P>Charles had so far cheated Mrs. Marlow, not∣withstanding her
opinion of his honesty, that he did not inform her of giving the bailiff five
guineas, as an accommodation fee, nor his paying the costs; all which,
together with the expence of his journey and passage, sunk his stock to
nineteen guineas; but he had not the heart to curtail the old gentle∣woman of a
single guinea.</P>
<P>He was fitting in his lodging counting this sum, and
considering what he should do with it, when the master of the house,
who had called at the post office, by his desire, brought him the foregoing
letter.</P>
<P>It is pity my time is now so precious that I can∣not give an
accurate description of Charles's recep∣tion <PB N="198" REF="196"/> of the
news this letter contained. No mad hero in romance ever played over such a
number of cu∣rious gambols; no, not the madest copier of them all, in the
madest of his curvets and caprioles, in the mountains of Morena. The Fleming
at whose house he lodged, might have sworn he was a tum∣bler, or a
lunatic. One moment he stampt and raved; the next, measured his length upon
the floor; then starting up, he, for about ten minutes, took a fit of
execrating all the world, but most himself. Next Gloss's throat was to be
cut: in short, if all his incoherencies were to have been literally put in
practice, he would have annihilated Gloss, pistolled Figgins, called Sir
Sidney an old fool, upbraided Annette as the most infamous of her sex,
kicked Emma to the devil, and then followed her himself; for so we may
fairly construe his saying he would nobly fall in their presence.</P>
<P>When this storm had a little subsided, he called the
affrighted Fleming into his presence, made an apology for his outrageous
conduct, and desired that a surgeon might be sent for. At the same time
he bid him take an account of some of the furniture, which he had broken in
his rage, and which he ob∣served his landlord to eye with tokens of grief and
astonishment, as it lay scattered about the floor.</P>
<P><PB N="199" REF="197"/> The surgeon being come, Charles told
him, in the most placid manner, that he had heard some un∣pleasant news
from England, of the death of a rela∣tion; that it had put him into that
ferment which I have so imperfectly described; and, lest a fever should
be the consequence, he begged to be bled. The surgeon perfectly approved of
the precaution, and immediately proceeded to work; after which our hero went to
bed, where a comfortable potation, advised by a physician, and prepared by
an apothe∣cary, who, seeing their brother professor enter the Fleming's
house, from the corner of a street, where they were in deep consultation,
about the different construction of syringes, dropt their controversy to
follow him.</P>
<P>These precautions operating with some calm, undisturbed
advice, which our hero had by this time whispered to himself, brought him
into such a state of tranquillity, that he pursued his journey the next
morning, and, in due time, arrived at the ancient city of Ghent. Here he
immediately looked for a lodging, and, at length, fixed himself to his
satisfaction, in the upper apartments of an uphol∣sterer, where the first
floor was occupied by a French widow lady, who had been settled there about a
year and a half. She was in but an indifferent state of health, and paid an
extraordinary price for her <PB N="200" REF="198"/> apartment, that she might
not be disturbed with the noise of a family over her head. This was however
no objection to her landlord's reception of Charles, who, she was told, was a
perfect stranger, and had no attendants. Nor perhaps was it a bar to his
ac∣commodation; for ladies, sick or well, never start at a handsome young
fellow: that is to say, as they do at toads and beetles. The lady also
first sighed, and then smiled, when her landlord added that the young
gentleman seemed to be very unhappy, but that he was certainly a man of
some consequence, and a most elegant and comely figure.</P>

<PB REF="199"/>
<HEAD>CHAPTER II.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>CONTAINING, BESIDES A VERY EXTRAORDINARY CHASE, AND THE
DETECTION OF THREE ROGUES, AN APPARENT IMPOS∣SIBILITY THAT THIS HISTORY SHOULD
END HAPPILY.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>CHARLES, as had been his intention, proclaimed himself to his
landlord as a painter, and expressed a wish to copy a few pictures, if
there could be any way of getting at them. The landlord told him that the very
lady who lodged in the first floor had two very capital ones, and, he had no
doubt, would lend them with great pleasure.</P>
<P>The request was made to her, and she returned for answer
that the gentleman might see the pic∣tures, and, if then they were found to
answer his purpose, he was very welcome to copy them.</P>
<P>To say truth, both the gentleman and the lady, though neither
knew why, were charmed at this in∣cident of the pictures; for the lady had
heard of no∣thing but the gentleman's parises, and particularly 
<PB N="202" REF="200"/> of the beauty of his person, ever since he had come
into the house, and he had an irresistible curiosity to see a
person as much sequestered from the world as himself, and for probably
as extraordinary rea∣sons. He therefore returned a proper compliment, and, at
a time perfectly convenient to her—that is to say, when she had put
on a new cap, and other∣wise prepared for his reception—he took the
liberty of paying his respects to her.</P>
<P>Neither Charles nor the lady would probably have made so much
ceremonious preparation for this inter∣view if they had foreseen how
intimately they were known to each other; for they had scarcely met when
she exclaimed—for women's perception, as well as their tongues, is
always forwardest— 
<Q REND="inline">'Good heavens! Mr. Hazard!'</Q>—which he
an∣swered as emphatically, with 
<Q REND="inline">'God bless my soul, Madame Combrie!'</Q> And
then recollecting that she was said to be a widow, he felt a singular
mixed sensation of surprise and pleasure, which gave a strange
embarrassed awkwardness to his manner, and prevented him from following
up his excla∣mation with a compliment.</P>
<P>Whether this proceeded from an inclination to enquire after
Combrie, which the knowledge of her present situation forbid, I will not
determine.—Certainly <PB N="203" REF="201"/> the lady chose to interpret
it in this light, for she immediately said, 
<Q REND="inline">'You look as if you would ask for poor
Combrie, Mr. Hazard: he is no more. He had scarcely made me independant, when
I lost him; but I am hastening after him, and we shall one day yet be
happy together.'</Q></P>
<P>Charles softened the conversation, declared him∣self
heartily sorry for her loss, but begged she would not dwell upon any part
of those circumstances which brought up the recollection of any thing that
pained her on remembrance.</P>
<P>She said she was obliged to him, but she had long since
learnt to be perfectly resigned to all that could happen, and the
conversation of such a friend as he had proved himself, would be as
agreeable to her as it had been unexpected.</P>
<P>When Mrs. Combrie was in the communicative vein, our hero
suffered her to inform him of the particulars relative to her affairs, after
the recovery of her fortune. What Combrie had written of his going to England,
was but a feint; for, embarking at Rouen, for Dunkirk, where he arrived in
safety, he posted immediately for Brussels. From Brus∣sels, which
they considered as too public a place, they removed to Ypres; but, previous
to this, <PB N="204" REF="202"/> Combrie took a journey to Amsterdam, and
there lodged their money. At Ypres they lived two years and a half in perfect
happiness, and were blessed with a daughter, who dying in the small
pox, her father, who had never had that fatal dis∣temper, and whose
attention to his darling child was not to be prevented, also fell sick, and
took that disorder in so dangerous a way as baffled every ex∣ertion of art.
In short, in one week fortune left her deprived of a tender husband and a
beautiful infant.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'At the first shock,' said she, 'I
thought I should not have lingered long after them. My constitu∣tion has,
however, been hitherto proof against the strongest grief that ever
attacked a human heart: but I am gradually declining, and in a few months,
perhaps weeks, shall follow poor Combrie.'</Q></P>
<P>Charles warned her against giving way to unne∣cessary
melancholy; advised her not to seclude her∣self from the world; gave her
every consolatory advice within his invention, and concluded with the most
fervent offers of his services, in any way that she should think proper
to command them.</P>
<P>She said, though she had good reason for suppos∣ing
that her end was approaching, she knew her <PB N="105" REF="203"/> duty as a
christian better than to accelerate it; and, to prove this, she had
empowered a capital house in Ghent to receive her money from the Dutch bank,
which, as soon as she had in her hands, it was her intention to pass over
to England, where, perhaps, the change of climate might restore her to
health: if not, she should have done her duty, and could then die
contented.</P>
<P>Charles greatly approved of her plan, and as he really felt
extremely sorry at the prospect of parting with a lady whom he had formerly
so essentially served, and whose case made her stand so much in
need of friendship and consolation, he manifested great anxiety in this
business. For one thing, he determined to recommend her to the tender care
of Mrs. Marlow; and, in short, though it was im∣possible to attend her
himself, he so laid out for her comfort and accommodation, that it gave him
no small pleasure to reflect that having once saved her fortune, he
should now, in all probability, save her life.</P>
<P>This was the benevolent employment, in a strange country, of
that horrid wretch who, in his own, was represented as a monster of
iniquity; for all which he received numberless thanks, and many a grateful
tear from the generous widow.</P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="204"/> One morning, as he waited on her to
communi∣cate some new scheme of pleasure he had been con∣triving for her,
he met on the stairs a man whom he was confident he had somewhere seen
before.—His surmises were presently realized into certainty, when
Madame Combrie informed him that the mer∣chant had been just with her, with
information that he expected one of his partners every day with the money.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'You are to know,' said she, 'I ever was
par∣tial to the English; and these merchants, who are of that country, are
the most sensible and feel∣ing men I ever knew. They are men of
business, and therefore have a blunt honesty about them that I ever
liked; and then as to property and se∣curity, I need only again say they
are English.—In short, I believe I could not have got into better
hands than Bondham and company.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Oh gracious God!' exclaimed Charles, 'what do
you tell me? For God's sake answer me: Was that Bondham I met on the
stairs?'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'It was,' said the lady.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Then by heaven and earth you are ruined,
madam!' returned Charles. 'Forgive me, my dear lady, forgive me. I would not
give you a moment's uneasiness, not the <PB N="207" REF="205"/>
slightest shock, but you have not an instant to lose. You are in the
hands of villains. Stay, is there an attorney near at hand? Can a man be
arrested in Austria by the plaintive himself, for a debt contracted in
England?'</Q></P>
<P>In short, without any further elucidation, our hero left the
astonished Madame Combrie, enquired out an attorney, and lugged him along
to the house of these merchants; but, alas! they came a few minutes too
late, Bondham and Co having all de∣camped: and, after some fruitless
enquiry, it was ascertained they had taken their departure towards the
frontiers.</P>
<P>He returned to Madame Combrie, in company with the attorney;
told her that his suspicions had been but too fatally confirmed; and begged
she would instantly empower him to do her justice: in which case he
would immediately follow these mis∣creants, whom he well knew how to make
an ex∣ample of.</P>
<P>He entreated the attorney to accompany him; to which he
consented, first making an agreement that he should be well satisfied
for his trouble: which only proves that attornies are attornies, all the world
over.</P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="206"/> The gentleman of the law then drew up a
short instrument, to give Charles sufficient power to act, and the
landlord, and indeed half the town—for our hero had dealt about his
curses pretty hand∣somely in the street—accompanied post horses
to the door, at which Charles entreated Madame Com∣brie to make herself as
easy as possible; for, added he, 
<Q REND="inline">'I once madam saved your fortune, and I will
now retrieve it, or perish in the attempt.'</Q></P>
<P>He then huddled a few necessaries together, mounted his
horse, and, with the attorney and the guide, galloped away in the very track
of the fu∣gitives. They lost them however for more than the last fifty
miles; but, coming to Amsterdam, found that they had actually received all
the money, and embarked but six hours before for Harwich.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Never mind,' cried out our hero, 'we will
follow them.'</Q> So saying, he was directed to a skipper, who, at an
exorbitant price, supplied them with a sloop, in which, by Charles's
direction, they ran, with a fair wind, under the shore of a village, at the
mouth of the Colchester river. Then taking the attorney and the skipper in
a post chaise, they stopt short of Harwich, at the house of a
magis∣trate, to whom Charles related his story; which was this: that
these men had defrauded him for∣merly <PB N="209" REF="207"/> out of a large
sum of money, for which trans∣action he had fairly hold of them in England;
but, he only wished to make his claim an instrument to rescue from them a
still larger sum, the property of a French lady, which, under false
pretences, they had drawn out of the bank at Amsterdam.</P>
<P>The justice, who happened to understand some∣thing of the
law, advised him to arrest them, as the first step; after which, he
said, he would back our hero's pretensions with his whole authority; and as
his presence, added to talking big, might facili∣tate the hoped for
success, he ordered his carriage, and willingly set out to accompany our
hero upon his laudable design.</P>
<P>The reader sees these men were the swindler formerly
spoken of, the bailiff who kept Charles's asylum for the unfortunate, and
his security. A∣gainst the security he had a fair action of fifteen
hundred pounds, being the moiety of what had been forfeited. Against the
swindler he might go for the whole, and also against the bailiff; and as
his business was to tamper with them as much as pos∣sible, he sent an
express for three separate writs, which kept him, though the utmost
expedition was used, upon the tenter hooks of fear and expectation, lest
his prey, in the interim, should escape.</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="208"/> Before they had proceeded a single mile
on the way, they saw a post chaise at an alehouse door, with a man
watering the horses. Presently Charles recognized Bondham, by the side of
a chaise. He now called to the postillion to stop, and pretend there was
something the matter with the carriage: thinking it would be more difficult
to surprise them separately than together. At the same time he begged
the magistrate would drive slowly on, and pass them, so that they might
be caught between two fires, for they had an officer behind each of the
carriages. This was happily executed. Charles's speaking to those in the
other carriage was not at all suspicious; for it only seemed mere
curiosity from one, which the other satisfied. At the same time he hid
his face, and otherwise kept himself completely from a discovery, which
indeed was not difficult, for the others suspected no snare.</P>
<P>At length our hero had the satisfaction of seeing the three
gentlemen enter the chaise; which done, he got out, pretending to
assist in setting the carri∣age to rights. The Flemish attorney and
postillion were also on their guard, and, as the other chaise drew near,
the latter, with great dexterity, left his work, and unhorsed his fellow
driver in an instant, and then ran to the heads of the horses, by which 
<PB N="211" REF="209"/> time the attorney at one door, and Charles at the other,
held their prisoners in safe custody.</P>
<P>Pretending not to know Charles, they called out, 
<Q REND="inline">'What do you mean to rob us?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'No,' said the officer, who was by this time
come up, 'we want to prevent you from robbing other people: I have separate
actions against you to the tune of seven thousand five hundred
pounds.'</Q></P>
<P>Nothing in nature is so cowardly as a detected viliain. If he
have a pistol in his hand, he will fire it through desperation; but, if he
be unarmed, no slinking cur ever tucked his tail between his legs in so
dastardly a manner.</P>
<P>The swindler cocked his hat, but that was all; the security
sweat, and the bailiff trembled from head to foot. By this time the
magistrate joined them, who exclaimed, 
<Q REND="inline">'God bless my soul, I find it is first
come first served here. I have a de∣mand upon these gentlemen. Come
mynheer, stand forward.'</Q></P>
<P>The skipper began to jabber something that no∣body
understood but the attorney, who explained in French that he had a claim on
them for defraud∣ing <PB N="212" REF="210"/> the Dutch bank, which our hero, in
a most in∣sulting tone, translated for them into English.</P>
<P>Next came a mock dispute between our hero and the
magistrates. Both claimed the gentlemen as their respective prisoners,
who, in their turn, be∣ginning to take a little courage, demanded to see by
what authority they were detained.</P>
<P>The officer said, archly, he had no sort of objec∣tion, if
they had a fancy for it, to expose them to every passenger on the road;
but he thought, as they might be assured they were nailed fast enough, it
would be the best way to go forward to his worship's, where every thing
would be properly explained to them. 
<Q REND="inline">'In short,' added he, 'here are the red tails,
and you may depend upon it I shan't let you out of my sight till you are
safely lodged in Chelmsford jail. I did my business first, and if his
worship wants you up afterwards, upon other affairs, that's none of my
concern: thousands are serious things, and my mind won't be easy till I
have fairly shopped you.'</Q></P>
<P>Several horsemen and others being seen at a dis∣tance, the
prisoners consented to go to his worship's, where a very serious
examination passed. The <PB N="213" REF="211"/> Dutch embassador's name,
and many others of very high authority, were bandied about with great free∣dom.
At length, there being, in fact, no possi∣bility of exhibiting a just
claim on the part of Ma∣dame Combrie, our hero contented himself with getting
from them his original three thousand pounds, upon undertaking, by virtue of
his power from that lady, that no further demand, on her ac∣count, should be
made against them in England.</P>
<P>As I shall not be able to edge in a word by and by upon such
paltry subjects, I will drop these three gentlemen in this place for ever,
by saying that after this triumvirate came to Flanders, they entered into
trade at Ghent, and, under the ap∣pearance of a considerable property,
negociated money matters, which they resolved to carry on with scrupulous
honesty, in order to beget them a character, till an opportunity should
offer of strik∣ing one stroke for all. This they thought they could not
more successfully practice than on a de∣fenceless widow.</P>
<P>Having so laid their plot that it could not fail—nor
indeed ever be known, had not Charles so un∣expectedly come across
them—they resolved to de∣camp, and, being arrived in England, avail
them∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elves of a fraudulent
bankruptcy: first sharing the <PB N="214" REF="212"/> whole of their effects
in equal proportions. This however they knew they could not do, unless they
previously came to a composition with our hero—for, in his affair,
there was evidently fraud, collu∣sion, and conspiracy—which they had
no doubt but they should be able to do, through a third person, upon easy
terms. Fortune, however, ordained it otherwise, as we have seen.</P>
<P>As to what became of them afterwards, the swin∣dler was one of
the first of those who were trans∣ported to Botany Bay, the security
died of poverty in a prison, and the bailiff, attaching himself to an
infamous prostitute—who first ruined, and then be∣trayed him—at
length followed his honourable principal.</P>
<P>After many sincere acknowledgments to the
ma∣gistrate—with whom they stayed all night—for his uncommon
attention and politeness, our hero and the attorney re-embarked, after
agreeing with the skipper to set them ashore at Ostend, which would
sooner bring them to the relief of Madame Com∣brie's suspense.</P>
<P>On the road, Charles let the attorney into his intention, as to
the report he should make of this business to the lady; at which
information, what∣ever <PB N="215" REF="213"/> it might be, he testified much
surprise, and in∣deed began to think the young gentleman was turned fool;
but, being convinced to the contrary, by Charles's following the discovery
with a reward, he, from that moment, certainly had a very great re∣gard for our
hero:—for he told him so.</P>
<P>They found Madame Combrie in a much weaker state than she
appeared to be in when they parted from her. She listened however to the tale
of their success with more unconcern than our hero ex∣pected,
which—for the reader knows he was de∣termined now to impose upon
people—he explained to be this.</P>
<P>That they had overtaken the fugitives, as we have mentioned, and
that being in England, where it was impossible to obtain any legal
redress—for the matter did not amount to a robbery, they having
received the money by her own order—he had been under the unpleasant
necessity of coming to a com∣position, and of receiving three thousand
pounds, instead of almost double that sum. 
<Q REND="inline">'Thank God you have recovered it, madam,' added
Charles, 'and let this narrow escape warn you in future how you trust to
strangers.'</Q></P>
<P>He then displayed documents to the amount of 
<PB N="216" REF="214"/> two thousand eight hundred and fifty pounds; the
rest, he said, having gone to defray different ex∣pences, and recompence
that gentleman—meaning the Flemish attorney—for the extraordinary
pains and attention he had shewn in the whole affair; finishing with a
most florid eulogium on the genero∣sity and disinterestedness of this
benevolent lawyer, who had—still like his brethren in other
countries—eaten, drank, and slept well, said yes and no, and rather
puzzled matters than explained them.</P>
<P>Our honest attorney being gone, Madame Com∣brie made a very
long and very grateful speech, by way of thanks, to our hero. Towards the
conclu∣sion she uttered these words.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Seeing all this is the case, that your own
situa∣tion is so straitened'—for Charles had told her every thing,
except indeed that he was in present ne∣cessity—'that I stand in
need of a protector, and that I sincerely believe there is not a man upon
earth of such generous, such delicate, honour as yourself, let me offer
you a right to call this money yours: a right I do not blush to tender: a
right that should Combrie look down and see us at this moment, he would
cheerfully sanctify; for he was good and benevolent, like
yourself.'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="215"/> 
<Q REND="inline">'Take care madam what you offer,' said our
hero: 'You do not however know all my situation. My debts in England would
consume nearly one third of this money; but I own we might orna∣ment a most
smiling cottage with the remainder.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Lookee, my dear Mr. Hazard,' said the lady, I
may not live, in which case, who can this mo∣ney so worthily belong to as
yourself? I hold it at present but as a trust:'—the poor lady
how∣ever did not know how nearly she approached to the truth—'and as,
were it fifty times that sum, were you without a sixpence in
possession or ex∣pectancy, it should court your acceptance, so I
can now only grieve that its insignificance reflects no merit on my
offer.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Madam,' said Charles, more seriously,
'you know my fatal devotion to a false and ungenerous young
lady:'</Q>—for I must explain here Charles's delicacy never would
permit him to name Annette. 
<Q REND="inline">'I do,' said the lady.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'You know I can never love another as I have
loved her.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'This also I both admit and admire,' said
the lady.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'You know it is not in my power to offer you
more than the most servent friendship.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Which, in you,' said Mrs. Combrie, 'has for
me more charms than the most violent love in any other <PB N="218" REF="216"/>
man.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'You know I have not a friend in the world, and
that my fortune is ruined.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Talk of something that will enhance the value
of my offer,' said the lady.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Knowing this, if you will take me,' exclaimed
Charles with the greatest warmth, 'I am yours; and heaven's my witness
nothing shall surpass the fidelity and admiration of the best husband
that ever devoted himself to the most disinterested and generous of
women: and now, my charming, angelic creature—for no∣thing is so young
and beautiful as goodness—let us first be married, and then to
England, where our cottage shall be thronged with joys unknown to
emperors.'</Q></P>
<P>It is almost unnecessary to add that the lady was charmed
with this conduct, or that the very next day they became man and wife.</P>

<PB REF="217"/>
<HEAD>CHAPTER III.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>IN WHICH, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE PARSON IS OBLIGED TO GIVE
WAY TO THE DOCTOR.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>HAVING, at this ticklish period, married my hero greatly, I
doubt not, to the disappointment of some readers, I shall leave him and
his sick wife, who really seem to be fit company for each other, and return
to England, from whence we have lately heard of a wedding in a very different
style.</P>
<P>That I may be as succinct as possible, I shall take the
matter up earlier than when Mrs. Marlow left Annette so highly in dudgeon,
and so come roundly to that point which I must tell the reader happened to
be a remarkably critical one.</P>
<P>The reader will readily recollect the conversation between Mr.
Ego and Mrs. Marlow, which, of course, was only an echo of what continually
passed at Sir Sidney's, and contained a very inconsiderable part of
those manoeuvres which Mr. Gloss daily put in practice, to deceive the good
baronet.</P>
<P><PB N="420" REF="218"/> He had however a much harder task to
perform; for Annette, and even Emma, must be shaken in their allegiance to
this king of their hearts, before he could stand the smallest chance of
moulding them to his purpose. To do this, he watched all our hero's actions,
and, when he set on foot his news∣paper, employed an agent to
purchase—virtually for him however—one of the shares. This, it
is not difficult to divine, was the man who arrested him, and from whom he
obtained his liberty, upon the terms of his going abroad, which, had he not
been so precipitate in proposing himself, would have been offered to
him.</P>
<P>The person who held this share of the paper for Mr. Gloss,
appeared to be a great favourer of the scheme, and was one of the last who
seceded; both of which steps were good policy, because one en∣abled him
to do the paper a great deal of private in∣jury, and the other kept all its
secrets within his knowledge to the last moment.</P>
<P>When the paper was put down, the other daily prints began, as I
have already said, to bespatter our hero, who, after the business of
the challenge, that he might not be provoked by them, read no∣thing they
inserted. On that account, the follow∣ing paragraph totally escaped his
notice, which was <PB N="221" REF="219"/> given to the public about four days
before Annette paid Charles that visit, the nature of which it is now my
business to explain.</P>
<Q> 
<P> 
<LABEL>PARAGRAPH.</LABEL></P> 
<P>We advise a certain baronet, with that warmth and interest
the nature of so extraordinary a case and his excellent character
deserve, to look with every possible caution to the security of his
amia∣ble daughter's person, who, notwithstanding her exemplary devotion to
the will of a tender father, may, nevertheless, be surprised by the
machina∣tions of a certain young newspaper adventurer, who, that his
mischievous brain may be always at work—having given over attacking
celebrated and established public productions—is now turn∣ing his
thoughts to a scheme which, unless the parties are extremely wary, will
destroy by force that domestic peace which he could not under∣mine by
art.</P></Q>
<P>This paragraph, in the usual pompous style, had scarcely
appeared when two or three strange fellows were watching about Sir Sidney's
house, and one was seen in the garden, but he made his escape over the
wall before the servant could come up with <PB N="222" REF="220"/> him. To
say truth, Sir Sidney was not a little alarmed. Indeed Annette herself
could not help testifying some surprise; and, as to Emma, though her
sentiments were perfectly decided, she kept them to herself; for some
freedoms Mr. Gloss had, about that time, provoked her to take, drew from Sir
Sidney what amounted to almost a declaration of dismissing her his
house, upon a repetition of such liberties.</P>
<P>Until the upshot of our hero's villanous stratagem should
be known, Sir Sidney proposed that they should all go into the country for
a few days, and the place made choice of was Richmond, where they had been
repeatedly invited by an old friend of the baronet.</P>
<P>Mr. Gloss having carried his point thus far, the
accomplishment of his scheme waited only for its <HI>coup de grace.</HI>
This was performed in the following manner.</P>
<P>As Annette was strolling in the garden, to enjoy the sweet
serenity of a moonlight night, and, not to hide the truth, to reflect on her
love for our hero, who now she began to fear would never be hers, and, what
was worse, never deserve to be hers, two men suddenly came behind her.
Having taken <PB N="223" REF="221"/> their measures like adepts in their
business, she was completely prevented from either struggling, or
alarming any of the family, and, in a very few mi∣nutes placed between the
strangers in a post chaise.</P>
<P>These gentlemen told her, with many assevera∣tions, to
back the truth of their assertions, that no harm was intended her; that
she was only to be carried to Squire Hazard's house, in London, who, Lord
bless his heart, for he was a worthy gentle∣man, loved her better than he did
his eyes, and who, this orator said, it was his belief, intended to marry her
that very night, or stick himself before her face.</P>
<P>Annette, with prayers and entreaties, begged they would carry
her back again. Her pride was deeply wounded at this poor, this paltry scheme
of stealing her from her father; and I must own, and com∣mend her for it at
the same time, that she had, at that moment, a contemptible opinion of
Charles.—At the same time she could not think that she ran the
smallest risk as to her honour. She could easily see she should
be pursued, and, as her father and Mr. Gloss were already upon their guard,
probably overtaken before they should arrive at the end of their journey.</P>
<P><PB N="224" REF="222"/> With these ideas in contemplation,
Annette bore her misfortune with something like composure, which so won,
in appearance, on her conductors, that they began to plead the cause of our
hero very forcibly: not but they allowed it was a little hard to oblige a young
lady to do any thing against her will, even though it was to please
herself. One of them pretended to be so attached to her interest, that he
would tell her, Lord love her pretty face, all how the thing was, that she
might better know what to make of matters when she should see young
Squire Hazard. This well concerted fiction was nothing more than fancying what
a man would na∣turally do who saw, as it were, a young lady fly into his very
arms. He said, at first sight our hero would appear very much
astonished at seeing her. He would then pretend to suppose the whole
busi∣ness was her act and deed. 
<Q REND="inline">'Ay,' said she, 'but he shall not have
time to do that.'</Q></P>
<P>Upon that circumstance they hitched their whole hope of
success. If once Charles and Annette should begin to quarrel, every word
must widen the breach; nor—that our hero might have as much
embarrassment as possible—was the time pitched upon a slight
article in this mass of contri∣vance. When could it be put in execution to
such good effect as at that moment when his mind was <PB N="225" REF="223"/>
perturbed, distracted, and broken to pieces, by re∣flecting on his
successless attempts at independancy, and when he was—which is
SHAKESPEARE's doubt magnified—flying from ills he had, to rush on
others that he knew not of.</P>
<P>All these matters, so artfully conceived, so nicely
combined, and so certain in their effect, could not fail of producing exactly
what we have seen. It is needless to say that Mr. Gloss kept the post
chaise in sight all the way, for he mounted his horse the moment they
were fairly off, leaving word with a servant to tell Sir Sidney—who he
had taken care should be at some distance—that seeking him and
explaining matters would take up too much time, but that Miss Roebuck was
stolen away by Mr. Hazard, and he was set out to follow them. He therefore
advised him to come to town himself with all expedition, but not to be
under the least appre∣hension, for he would restore the young lady, or
lose his life in the attempt. There was something a little awkward in not
taking the baronet with him; but there would have been risk in it, and the
strong circumstances which would afterwards come out, must, he knew,
completely cover any inaccu∣racy that, in a contrivance of so complicate a
na∣ture, was of course indispensible.</P>
<P><PB N="226" REF="224"/> When Annette got home, and Sir Sidney
heard her inveigh against our hero, and extol, in the highest terms of
panegyric, the generosity and gal∣lantry of Gloss, he ran over with
pleasure. He al∣most pitied the poor desperate devil, who had been put to
so pitiful, so unavailing a piece of villanous folly, so ill contrived
that it defeated its own end. He launched out into the most grateful flow of
warmth and energy in praise of Gloss, and told his daughter that she
could no longer refuse to give him her hand. Grant, he said, that this
young mon∣ster had formerly made an impression on her heart, it was now
as much a duty she owed herself as him, to tear from her mind all traces of
a passion that could reflect on her only unworthiness and disho∣nour:
an affection for an unprincipled villain and a paltry coward.</P>
<P>Indeed nothing had set Sir Sidney so much against Charles
as his having refused to accept the challenge; especially after Gloss had
reminded him that one of his ancestors, in the reign of one of the Edwards,
had, at a tournament, fought a duel by the king's authority.</P>
<P>Mr. Gloss was not yet however contented. He would seek for
more proofs against Mr. Hazard.—The affection of such a young lady as
Miss Roe∣buck <PB N="227" REF="225"/> could not but be decided, let it be
placed ever so unworthily. No pains ought to be spared to restore ease
to so gentle a heart: a heart that it should be the whole devotion of his
life to merit.</P>
<P>The next day he pretended to enquire about Charles, and found,
to his great astonishment—for so he told Sir Sidney—that he
had somehow or other got rid of the bailiff, and slipt away to France.
Another day or two was taken to enquire into the particulars of this
transaction. Every moment of all this time Sir Sidney was making preparations
for the wedding: Annette being yet wavering and unresolved, till, on the
morning of that day when Mrs. Marlow called at Sir Sidney's, by the greatest
good luck in the world, the bailiff and the two bail were found out, and
brought before Sir Sid∣ney, to whom they offered to make oath that Charles was
gone abroad to be married, and pro∣duced the bond as a corroboration of what
they asserted.</P>
<P>Annette, without hesitation, now consented to the marriage;
to do which she mustered up so strong a portion of resolution, and
wore such ap∣parent content in her features, that except now and then a
sigh, she betrayed no sort of repugnance be∣fore company, as to what was
going forward.</P>
<P><PB N="228" REF="226"/> Emma however was not even yet deceived;
but what could avail her feeble voice in a multitude?—that is to say in
mere reasoning, for if she had spoken out it would have been in
thunder—especially pro∣hibited as she was from speaking. It was on
this account she desired Mrs. Marlow, while Annette was at the other end of
the room, to tell Charles 
<Q REND="inline">'that his enemy was now an Antaeus in the arms
of Hercules.'</Q></P>
<P>This the good lady did not understand, or could not remember,
otherwise it might have made some alteration in Charles's conduct. And now
came the moment, as Emma thought, for her to step for∣ward. She gloried in
the opportunity, and the more her adversaries approached to an host, the
stronger she found herself against them.</P>
<P>Her grand coup de theatre, however, was for the present
postponed; for, at six o'clock on that very morning Annette was to have
been made a bride, it was the opinion of every one about her that she would
never be married but to her grave. She was seized with so violent a fever,
accompanied by so strong a delirium, that her father, Lady Roebuck, three
physicians, and an apothecary, were fully of opinion she could not live
till the canonical hour. <PB N="229" REF="227"/> Mr. Gloss however, to work as
secretly as possible, did not fail to blaze in the papers with an account
of the wedding; no circumstance being omitted to hyperbolize the splendid
talents of the bridegroom, or the fortune, beauty, and accomplishments of the
daughter of that truly patriotic and independant country gentleman, Sir Sidney
Walter Roebuck, the oldest title of baronet in the kingdom.</P>
<P>Annette's illness, in compliment to Charles—though it
was no more than what had happened to him, in compliment to her—had like
to have had effects as dangerous as they were sudden. For a whole fortnight
nobody expected she would reco∣ver. After that time however, though she
certainly exhibited tokens of convalescence, yet her mind had been so
rudely shocked, as to leave the recovery of her intellects a very doubtful
business. They were at length so far restored as to sadden into a
settled, placid melancholy, which left her a pale and mournful example of
sensible and unshaken constancy.</P>
<P>Mr. Gloss began now to be afraid that providence had
determined to defeat what he had defied the impuissant art of man to
destroy. Yet, that nothing might be wanted on his part, he was indefatigable 
<PB N="230" REF="228"/> to procure intelligence of our hero's motions; when, at
length, through Ego, he learnt of his marriage: Ego himself having been
informed of it by Mrs. Marlow.</P>
<P>Emma, finding that this marriage was no coun∣terfeit, like the
rest, began in earnest to fear that all was over. To satisfy herself of
the particulars, she called on Mrs. Marlow—for now she was
de∣termined to keep no measures—and was by her shewn the letters from
our hero, by which she plainly saw he had fallen a victim to the arts of
Gloss. Her heart bled for him. She perceived he had entailed misery on
himself through the best pride and the noblest honour that ever young man
possessed. His case therefore appeared to be des∣perate.</P>
<P>This however she conceived ought, for the sake of her young
lady, rather to accelerate than retard her measures, which she was now
resolved to go about fully and fairly: especially as, to give expe∣diency
to them, she had, through Mrs. Marlow, though unknown to that good woman,
made a strong corroborative discovery of one of those facts through which
she expected to carry her point.</P>
<P>Emma compared herself to General Monk; say∣ing, 
<PB N="231" REF="229"/> she was determined to strike no stroke till she
should be sure of success.</P>
<P>Having now, however, collected her whole force into one point of
view, she marched forward, and, without a single hostile movement,
obtained a de∣cisive victory.</P>
<P>In other words, Sir Sidney no sooner heard what she had to
alledge, backed with such convincing proofs, than no man upon earth ever took
such blame to himself, or conceived such an inveterate enmity to another
as he did to Mr. Gloss. Indeed had not the discovery Emma made involved
matters of still greater importance, which were not yet quite ripe for public
examination, nothing could have restrained the baronet from making of his
quondam favourite an immediate and most severe example. As it was, he
fairly inlisted under General Emma, who, though she feared she should
not put her King Charles in possession of that throne Annette's
per∣son, yet she was now sure of restoring the happiness of that
kingdom Sir Sidney's family, whose interest she had so dearly at
heart.</P>
<P>Poor Annette could enjoy none of this. A heavy languor pervaded
her senses. She received every thing that was said to her with beautiful
attention <PB N="232" REF="230"/> and solemn innocence, but gave no tokens of
col∣lected comprehension, except answering with a sigh any passage of
tenderness, and now and then letting fall a pearly tear, with always—in
a faint, but sweet accent—the exclamation of 
<Q REND="inline">'I am sure poor Charles is not a
villain.'</Q></P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER IV.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>CONTAINS A REPENTANT SINNER, AND AN EXPIRING SAINT.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>As Emma's provident conduct, with her prin∣cipal, General Monk,
in view, seems to be an ex∣ample worthy imitation, I shall here so far
follow it as to bring into one focus such objects as will conduce to an
elucidation of what to some may have appeared extraneous.</P>
<P>As however, early in this history, I disclaimed the idea of
introducing any thing foreign to the sub∣ject—indeed I must have been
very absurd if I had introduced any such thing, for I have full matter
enough that honestly appertains to it—I will not give what I am now
going to explain the appellation of extraneous, but leading
circumstances.</P>
<P>To effect some part of this purpose, I shall now give a
brief account of Mr. Figgins, from the time he bid our hero adieu at Lyons, to
the period to which this history is advanced. The reader knows 
<PB N="234" REF="232"/> that the gentleman I am speaking of was heartily glad
to quit Charles, and return to England. To this however he was induced by a
motive, among others, of a better kind than has been yet explained. He was then
doing, or rather professing to do what we are told, by the highest
authority, is im∣possible; namely, serving two masters: and which, to
keep that incomparable idea in view, was, lite∣rally speaking, God and
Mammon. In short, his compacts with Charles and Mr. Standfast were very
opposite things; yet, to the one he was obliged, and to the other willing to
adhere.</P>
<P>Mr. Figgins had not sufficiently considered that however
vice may have its allurements, there is yet something so pure, so winning
in virtue and ho∣nour, that a man stands a chance of becoming a convert to
it, even though—like an advocate who pleads a cause he has no opinion
of—he should only maintain the subject by way of mere argument.</P>
<P>Thus it happened to Mr. Figgins, for he very often caught
himself in the very act of seriously admiring our hero, when his
agreement was to serve his enemies.</P>
<P>He did not flinch, however, as we have seen.—He
discharged his trust to the very letter of it, and <PB N="235" REF="233"/>
then claimed what had been promised him, a living of two hundred a year, to
be added to his other income.</P>
<P>Finding however that Mr. Standfast's perfor∣mance of this
promise depended upon the interest of Zekiel, who, as we have seen, upon
his accession to his fortune, left him fairly in the lurch, Mr. Figgins
began to see he had been a rogue for no-nothing. He could not,
notwithstanding, blame Mr. Standfast, whose loss was still heavier;
yet he was determined to shake of that tyrannical yoke which—in
consequence of a few favours conferred on him in his youth, out of which, by
the way, the other had had his gleanings—Standfast had so hea∣vily
laid on his shoulders. To do this with perfect propriety was, however, no
easy task, nor would he have been able to effect it, with any prospect of
real satisfaction to himself, or advantage to others, if he had not thought
of a coalition with Emma.</P>
<P>To this Mr. Figgins was stimulated by various motives. Mr.
Standfast had unbent his mind a good deal before him, and particularly in an
al∣tercation one day with Mrs. O'Shocknesy, when such hints were thrown out
as obliged him, in his mind, to take a decided part on the spot.</P>
<P><PB N="236" REF="234"/> A few days after this he received
intelligence from Mr. Balance of the handsome way in which our hero had
settled on him a hundred a year.—This determined him to take an
<HI>active</HI> part. The consideration that all his dirty work had been paid
by a disappointment, and that the very man he had assisted to cheat had
conferred on him such an un∣expected and unmerited benefit, worked strongly
in his heart. It reproached him with being a ras∣cal; a despicable, low,
shuffling villain. In short, like Harry Hotspur's starling, nothing,
sleeping or waking, was dinned in his ears by his conscience but such
opprobrious sounds, till, at length, the conslict abated, and he tasted
the pleasure of feeling himself an honest man.</P>
<P>To do our hero any thing like justice, he saw was a most
tremendous task indeed, and of this he soon convinced Emma, who said it
was plain the at∣tempt, and not the deed, would confound them.</P>
<P>The reader will admit that circumstances, half disclosed,
lead to such a maze of apparently differ∣ent meanings, that the chances are
infinitely against coming at the truth, by pursuing any one of them. No
wonder then they were frequently thrown out, and unable to proceed with
certainty to any thing further than what Sir Sidney was now acquainted 
<PB N="237" REF="235"/> with, and which, as it related only to the downfal of
Mr. Gloss, and our hero's reconciliation with the baronet, was but a trifle
in comparison of what they were sure, by patience and perseverance, they
might achieve.</P>
<P>Besides, to say the truth, they were willing to let Charles
go the length of his tether. There was such redundancy of goodness in his
mind, that it was absolutely necessary he should know the world
practically: that he should feel experience. They thought they could marry
him to Annette when∣ever they pleased: but here indeed they reckoned without
their host, though it must be owned not without good sense; for nothing
could be so unlike∣ly as that he should take so extraordinary a step,
though, as matters turned out, I hope the reader does not think it
extraordinary at all.</P>
<P>Thus then their plot rolled on, like a snow ball, till Annette
began to be actually in danger; for then it was found necessary for Figgins
to act overtly towards Charles, in proportion as Emma observed the same
conduct with Sir Sidney. For this purpose he called at Charles's
house—for he was the stranger of whom Mrs. Marlow speaks in her
letter—with the news of his brother's dangerous illness, which 
<PB N="238" REF="236"/> was no invention, but actually a fact; and, to con∣firm
what is there imperfectly given, I now inform the reader that Master
Zekiel—to use the landlord's expression at the John of
Gaunt—began to rub off the rust of his ancestors, by leaving the
world three days after the sporting accident, before spoken of; upon which
Mr. Tadpole took possession, at the Lady Dowager's desire, for the
eldest son, lawfully begotten by Lord Hazard, till he should arrive to
the age of one and twenty: and, in case of his death, for the younger.</P>
<P>Mr. Gloss, however, who could see as well and as far as
either Mr. Figgins or Mrs. Emma, took care, as we have seen, to defeat the
whole end of this friendly visit. It was however repeated the day after Mrs.
Marlow wrote to Charles, when Mr. Figgins explained himself as far as he
thought neces∣sary, and, among the rest, told the good old lady that he
had three hundred and fifty pounds belong∣ing to the young gentleman, which he
wanted to remit him: which money, to shew to what a de∣gree Figgins was
become honest, was the very identical annuity, as far as he had received it,
which Charles had settled on him, and which he vowed to the Almighty, in the
presence of Emma, he would not touch a shilling of till he had, like a man
of <PB N="239" REF="237"/> honour, confessed his former conduct to Charles
himself, implored his pardon, and, by some wor∣thy atonement, merited his
friendship.</P>
<P> Upon this subject he incessantly besieged Mrs. Marlow,
and indeed so did Emma, till, finding they were real friends—for, as
Emma told her, 
<Q REND="inline">'he who gives money seldom
feigns'</Q>—the old gentle∣woman became as anxious to bring about this
recon∣ciliation, as Figgins to desire it. But how was this to be done? Our
hero's proceedings had been so sudden and extraordinary, that he had no
opportu∣nity of writing till he was ready to come to En∣gland, and then he
thought it unnecessary; for, lest his wife should become weaker, they
packed up their alls, and began their journey in a day or two after their
marriage: so that not one syllable came from Charles to Mrs. Marlow, till
she re∣ceived the following letter from Rochester. 
<LETTER>
<HEAD>TO Mrs. MARLOW, AT —</HEAD>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>MY GOOD MARLOW,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P> I intended to have surprised you with my presence;
but it cannot be. I am not how∣ever sick, except at heart; nor is my person
in <PB N="240" REF="238"/> danger: on the contrary, the wished-for com∣petency
is already obtained. As however it is impossible to come on to you, you
must come, and that immediately, to me, for I want you in a case where all
your attentive tenderness and sym∣pathy will be necessary. I am sure
I need not urge you further.</P>
<P> I have volumes to tell you, therefore you can know nothing
till we meet; only this, that I am married: so Mrs. Gloss has not so
completely triumphed as perhaps she imagines; for you see I can even write
her damned name with all the com∣posure in the world.</P>
<CLOSER>
<SIGNED>Yours, most faithfully, C. HAZARD.</SIGNED>
<POSTSCRIPT>
<P>Call at the Bell.</P>
</POSTSCRIPT></CLOSER>
</LETTER></P>
<P>Mrs. Marlow, who had, though innocently, been herself the
cause of what our hero had done, was in a sit of distraction at the
receipt of this letter.—She thought every door was now barred between
Charles and that which could alone procure his hap∣piness.</P>
<P>In this situation she was found by Figgins, who, in vain,
administered every possible consolation to <PB N="241" REF="239"/> her.
She said she was an ungrateful woman; a wrong-headed, impatient wretch;
who, in return for saving her and hers from wretchedness and mi∣sery, had
wantonly, though heaven knew not wickedly, heaped destruction on the head of
her be∣nefactor.</P>
<P>At length, however, they both considered that to lose a
moment's time would be committing a real crime, while she was only accusing
herself of an imaginary one. It was therefore determined that they should
both set out in the same post chaise, and that Figgins should begin
his attack on our hero's sensibility in the presence of Mrs. Marlow, who
had so much to say in his desence. Indeed they most seriously
promised to be each other's advocate, though both knew there was not a
tenderer nor more merciful heart upon earth; and this was a greater
consolation to Figgins than to Mrs. Mar∣low, for he well knew how sublimely
our hero ex∣celled in all noble and generous exertions, while she was
convinced that this very sweetness in him would be her bitterest
sorrow, for the readier he might be to forgive her, the more unwilling
should she be to forgive herself; and indeed both of these reflections
were perfect in their kind, for one had been guilty of crimes which, to procure
peace of <PB N="242" REF="240"/> mind, must be pardoned and forgotten, whereas
the other was only an error, which ought to be re∣membered, that it might not
be repeated.</P>
<P>I shall now leave our hero's friend and house∣keeper on the
road to Rochester, and see how he himself came there, as well as explain
why he could not reach London. The matter will be understood when I say
that, having determined to visit En∣gland, immediately after the wedding, he
and his lady set out, by short stages, to Ostend; for it was yet
possible that it might be dangerous for her to set her foot in France,
and it was his business not to do any thing that could give her the
smallest ap∣prehension. This journey was also taken as soon as
possible, for marriage had not, by any means, abated the good lady's
disorder: on the contrary, she visibly became worse every day, which
was not perhaps a little facilitated by a discovery of our hero's trick, as
to the fortune.</P>
<P>In short, the attorney, looking upon the trans∣action as a
kind of miracle, proclaimed it from one to another, till at length it came to
the lady's ears, who finding that very generosity performed by another of
which she hoped to reap all the glory herself, grew—so perverse
is human nature—very unhappy at it. Not that she repined at being
de∣pendant <PB N="243" REF="241"/> on such a husband, for she spoke of
his greatness of soul with a kind of adoration; but her tender heart melted
to think that she could give nothing in return for such goodness, but
trouble, uneasiness, and sorrow. That a perfect youth, rich in all the
gifts of nature, and blest with heaven's best endowments, should be fated
to drag on a life of sadness, and receive only the feeble endearments of
unavailing gratitude, when the willing and inspir∣ing love of the
handsomest and best woman upon earth would be infinitely beneath his
merits.</P>
<P>Some other female considerations perhaps lent these a little
strength. Mrs. Hazard was many years older than her husband: her illness
had not altered her person to her advantage—for she cer∣tainly had
been a very beautiful woman—and the consciousness that she could
not render him that at∣tention her wishes prompted her to, finished her
wretchedness; a settled gloom pervaded her mind, and she pined at heart
that she could only give thanks where it would have delighted her soul to
have bestowed worlds.</P>
<P>There was however a stronger reason than any of these. Her
disorder had taken deep hold on her before she saw Charles, and when
she set out for England it had become a serious business. Our 
<PB N="244" REF="242"/> hero therefore, before he took this step, had a
con∣sultation of physicians, who privately assured him that whatever
was done could be considered only as an experiment, for that her end, though
it seemed at some small distance, evidently appeared but too certain. A
voyage to England therefore was by no means unadvisable, for certainly they
had known change of air and a passage by sea bring about ex∣traordinary
cures, and that, if it should have the contrary effect, he would have the
consciousness of recollecting the integrity of his own intentions in a
business where fate at last was to decide.</P>
<P>Mrs. Hazard arrived at Ostend tolerably well, considering
her situation, and Charles, after resting two or three days, to find a
convenient vessel, and choose calm weather, handed her on board a sloop
bound for Dover. Their passage however was ren∣dered both tedious and
troublesome, by an altera∣tion of the wind, which suddenly chopt about, and
blew almost a gale. Charles was himself very sick, but his wife's
situation was dreadful; on which he was congratulated by several
passengers, who said they were sure it would restore the lady's
health. Those however who entertain this opinion are egre∣giously
mistaken, for how can straining and lace∣rating the stomach be of
service to it. I shall not, at any rate, pretend to say farther on this
subject <PB N="245" REF="243"/> here, than that it had on this good lady an
effect very different from that prognosticated; for she had scarcely
landed at Dover, after a passage of seventeen hours, when she was
seized with fainting fits, which followed one another, at different
inter∣vals, for three days; after which, she grew more equal in her
symptoms, being neither so high nor so low in spirits.</P>
<P>In this equanimity of mind, she thought she could very well
proceed on her journey, and both she and our hero flattered themselves
that, after this crisis of her disorder, it would take a favoura∣ble turn.
They therefore set out, making short stages; or, as the postillion from
the ship, who had been a sailor, called it, trips.</P>
<P>At length the whole hopes of both Charles and his lady were
frustrated; for she had scarcely got into the inn at Rochester, when
she was again seized with her fainting fits, which continued in so long
and so alarming a succession, that the worst conse∣quences were
greatly feared. Charles therefore wrote, as we have seen, immediately to Mrs.
Mar∣low, till whose arrival he became—as indeed he had been all
along—a tender and affectionate husband, a consoling and
instructive companion, and, what was perhaps as much to his honour as either,
a <PB N="246" REF="244"/> watchful and attentive nurse:—and in this
senti∣ment I will insist; for upon the same principle, in a state,
that the bustle of war is only necessary in proportion as it promotes the
blessings of peace, so he is the greatest man who can relish, after
the exertions of his public duty, in a still more exalted degree, the
felicity arising from domestic tranquil∣lity.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER V.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>WHERE THE READER WILL PAY A MELANCHOLY VISIT TO ROCHESTER
CATHEDRAL.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WHEN Mrs. Marlow arrived at Rochester, Mrs. Hazard was at the
last extremity, so that the good old lady had little more to do than to
close her eyes.</P>
<P>Mrs. Hazard's whole conduct, throughout her illness, had been
touching and exemplary. Charles, though he did not love her with ardour, yet
loved her with a better affection than do nine husbands out of ten love their
wives. He found himself pos∣sessed of a woman capable of making any
man happy, and with whom he had flattered himself he should pass a life
of sober, rational delight. Again, she was a kind of outcast, like
himself, and their fortunes, by a similar chain of circumstances, pointed
them out as fit partners for each other. It is not justice then to say he
barely regretted her loss. He mourned it; honestly, sincerely mourned it.
Indeed so much, that had he been given his choice <PB N="248" REF="246"/> to
have had her restored to life, or Annette un∣married, he would not have
hesitated a moment: so much was generosity in him above
self-interest.</P>
<P>All that he could now do was to pay what respect was in his
power to her memory. He procured her to be buried in the cathedral; had a
small, but elegantly designed, monument erected over her grave; drew the
design and wrote the epitaph him∣self; in which was prettily introduced her
maiden name, her name by her first marriage, and that which she owned when
she died; concluding that he, disconsolate as he was, evidently
deserved her less than either her father or her first husband: for
she had fled from him, to join them.</P>
<P>This image, poetically put, had, as the reader sees,
capabilities, and Charles so improved upon them, that his pen did not shame
his conception.</P>
<P>These preparations took up nearly seven weeks; for Charles
would not stir from the spot till he had seen them finished. The
exemplary conduct of so respectable a young man, drew a crowd of friends
about him, and his lodgings were thronged with a number of the first people
in the neighbourhood, who called on him with compliments of condolence, all
which he received with an unaffected dignity, <PB N="249" REF="247"/> peculiar
to himself; till at length, having settled every thing to his
satisfaction, he left Rochester with the title of The pattern for
husbands.'</P>
<P>All this train of circumstances I thought it better to
dispatch at once, than to introduce Figgins be∣fore I could give him a clear
course.</P>
<P>When Figgins and Mrs. Marlow came within a mile of Rochester,
it was agreed that he should get out, and saunter slowly on, in order
that she might break the ice for him. When she came to the Bell, however, a
waiter was sent with her to Charles's apartments, where being immediately
conducted to the lady's chamber, and finding her in the condi∣tion I have
described, all ideas of any other cir∣cumstance or person upon earth
utterly fled from her. She thought no more of Mr. Figgins than of the man in
the moon. On his part, when he came to the inn, and, upon enquiry, found how
matters were, he felt that he could not have chosen a more improper moment
than the present, and therefore determined to wait a day or two, or till he
should hear from Mrs. Marlow.</P>
<P>The next morning, however, Mrs. Hazard's death happened, and
when Mrs. Marlow had re∣freshed <PB N="250" REF="248"/> herself, after her
fatigues, with a little sleep, it came into her mind that Figgins must be
at the inn.</P>
<P>It will readily be seen that this event, sad as it was, had
abated Mrs. Marlow's anger against her∣self; for, both our hero and Annette
being at that moment single, the mischief she had done was, as she
thought, not now irretrievable.</P>
<P>It was a sad moment to be sure, but still her tongue
itched to inform Charles that Sir Sidney was his friend, and that there was no
further obstacle, except poor Annette's unhappy indisposition, to the
completion of his wishes. She could not however help throwing out a few
hints. This she took an opportunity of doing that very evening, while Charles
was contemplating with sober awful atten∣tion the features of the poor lady,
who was then ly∣ing in her shroud. After a long and silent exami∣nation of
that dreary state of sad mortality; that state so much courted, yet
so little desired; an invo∣luntary sigh escaped him, and he uttered, 
<Q REND="inline">'There certainly is a resemblance.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'A resemblance of what?' said Mrs. Marlow,
near whom he did not seem conscious he was then standing.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Oh!' said Charles, starting, 'I had forgot
you <PB N="251" REF="249"/> were here. What did you say?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Nay,' said she, 'I asked you what you
said.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Upon my word I have forgot,' answered
Charles, 'but I know I was thinking that poor Annette here—'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Annette!' said Mrs. Marlow, 'no, thank God,
she is not here, nor in this shocking state. An∣nette! Lord sir, what
made you think of Miss Annette?'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Miss Annette!' said Charles. 'Is she
not—'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'No that she is not,' cried the good old lady,
'she is not married, nor has she been. It was a report, and a lie,
circulated by that devil Gloss; and three days after I had written you word
of it, I could almost have cut off the very fingers that held the pen which
wrote such false news. No sir, thank God, that villain's reign is over;
Sir Sidney will beg your pardon, and you will be re∣stored to his
friendship.'</Q></P>
<P>Charles stood in such astonishment while he heard
these words, that he could not prevent her uttering them. The moment she
had done so, how∣ever, he replied 
<Q REND="inline">'I hope all this may be found true, but it would
be indecent indeed, at present, to enter into it further. The most
desirable ex∣pectation upon earth should not prevent me from doing my duty
here.'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="252" REF="250"/> 
<Q REND="inline">'Ay, ay, you again,' said Mrs. Marlow. 'God
bless you for it. Will any body make me believe you won't at last be
perfectly happy? But I beg your pardon; I won't say another word; only this,
that poor Mr. Figgins has repented of all his villany, and you have not a
better friend in the world.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Figgins?' said Charles. 'Impossible!'</Q>

<Q REND="inline">'In∣deed sir it is not,' said Mrs. Marlow,
'for he is now at the inn, and dares not come into your pre∣sence, for fear
you should not pardon him, al∣though he would lay down his life to receive
for∣giveness at your hands.'</Q></P>
<P>She then produced the three hundred and fifty pounds, and began
to enumerate so many proofs of his conversion, that Charles, in spight of
himself, heard her to an end, and, when he had done so, was upon the point
of dispatching a messenger to Figgins, to see him immediately; but Mrs.
Mar∣low said it would be better to send to him that night, but not to
appoint him till the morning, for he would be greatly affected at a proposal
of being kindly received, and it would give a little time to prepare him for
such a meeting.</P>
<P>This was well put in by Mrs. Marlow, for it en∣sured 
<PB N="253" REF="251"/> Figgins a kind message, which must inevita∣bly be
the harbinger of a reconciliation.</P>
<P>The next morning, the breakfast things upon the table, and our
hero sitting thoughtfully, while he looked at a book which he could pay no
attention to, Figgins was ushered in by Mrs. Marlow. He was beginning, with a
low inclination of the body, to make a speech, when our hero, taking him by
the hand, interrupted him with 
<Q REND="inline">'Mr. Figgins, I beg I may not hear a single
retrospective word. If it can be possible that you ever did me any ill
office, it must have been through the blind influence of false gratitude.
Sense of obligation to a rascal made you, perhaps, a little unjust
yourself. It is not till lately I have seen this, nor did you, very likely,
at the time. At any rate, my mind is now in no state for investigations;
therefore, I beg our conversation may be on no topic that may divert it from
that object on which it is fixed.—For the rest, I freely give you my
hand; and as I am sure we ever had a regard for each other, let it in future
continue without interruption.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'My incomparable friend exactly,' said
Figgins. Oh God, sir, I wish you would permit me to give way to what I
feel. But I suppress it. Yet I shall never be happy till, by shewing
you what I <PB N="254" REF="252"/> have been, you shall see what I truly am.
How could I?—but I have done. Only let me say that this is the
happiest moment of my life, because it is the most honourable.'</Q></P>
<P>After some hours, Charles began to be greatly pleased at
having Figgins with him in this extre∣mity. He had suffered much poignant
uneasiness from reflecting that he was again without a single friend.
Figgins had been the only man he had ever considered in that light. To him he
had given his unreserved confidence. The lighter and more youthful of his
pleasures had been pursued in his company, which, though perhaps not the
most wor∣thy, yet are unceasingly the most endearing. In short, Charles
was melancholy, he was fatigued at heart by looking at nothing but unpleasant
pros∣pects, real pain, and certain disappointment. Not that his grief was
of that very apparent kind which pained every body who witnessed it. He had
no opinion of that sorrow which vents itself in cries and lamentations. His
was ardent and honest, but it was decent and manly. Thus, no friend ever came
more opportunely. With Figgins he could divide it: from him he could receive as
much consolation as such grief was capable of admitting. There were
collateral considerations also that weighed in this business. Figgins
had known poor Combrie; had <PB N="255" REF="253"/> assisted in obtaining
that very fortune, part of which Charles had now in his possession; and
it gave him a melancholy pleasure to reflect that their returning
friendship would be cemented by so awful a cir∣cumstance as Figgins's
performing the last mourn∣ful rites to the poor deceased lady.</P>
<P>Thus consoled, Charles consulted his friend in every step
he took, and they both became so fond of their solemn office, that no other
subject in∣truded itself till after the day that hid the lady's cares
within the silent tomb.</P>
<P>Into that tomb however I shall not descend, nor shall I
say any thing more about it than that, from the moment it was completed to
Charles's satisfac∣tion, no stranger ever visited Rochester cathedral
but was particularly shewn it, and told its history.</P>
<P>From the interment to the time of their quitting Rochester,
Figgins took every opportunity of open∣ing his grand battery, which he begged
he might preface with a history of himself, that his friend might see
what sort of men there were in the world, and how easy it was to pass art
and wickedness for wisdom and goodness. He assured Charles it would
take a burthen off his mind that never could be lightened but by a free
confession; that it was the <PB N="256" REF="254"/> only lurking
uneasiness that remained; and, that once dissipated, he should never
again suffer a single moment's care; but, on the contrary, if he were
prohibited from the only means that could relieve his mind, his whole life
would be imbittered with the recollection that his happiness was
incomplete.</P>
<P>At length, Charles growing more and more com∣posed in his
mind, Figgins was permitted to say what he pleased, which favour obtained,
he began as follows.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'My dear sir, let me premise to you, never
take into your favour a man whose origin or education has placed him in the
way of imbibing low or vulgar prejudices. In proportion as he has abi∣lity
enough to think for himself, he will, from a captious consciousness of
inferiority, fancy him∣self in as natural a state of warfare with his
supe∣riors, as the crow does with the eagle, and will supply in cunning
what he wants in strength.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'These being his affections, should an
opportu∣nity serve of mending his fortune, what are then his reflections?
Why, truly, that superior talents have done that for him which ungrateful
fortune neglected to do. He therefore transfers the obli∣gation from himself
to his patron, and, with all <PB N="357" REF="255"/> the low cunning of a
tricking servant, he will do his utmost to undermine that interest it is
his duty to promote. At the same time there are some few examples to the
contrary. Very few, how∣ever; for he the world calls an upstart is very
feldom indeed known to be grateful.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'How must it be then when one lowly born, bred
in a school situate in the midst of every species of wickedness,
stimulated to all the licentious prac∣tices of broils and riots, and
practised only in art and craftiness, meets, at his setting out in the
world, with a man who makes a point of chusing him out for this very
unluckiness, and who means to use no part of his qualities but those
which are to disgrace him in the eye of every honest man.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'These are the portraits of Mr. Standfast
and myself! I think not my birth a disgrace, for my parents were honest.
I think not my education an unavailing one, because I imbibed the same
prin∣ciples of learning as I should have done at the best school; but as,
till I was almost a man, I mixed with none but the most filthy vulgar, what
won∣der if low cunning and subtle artifice made up my mind: for how, but by
the use of such talents, could I ever hope to rise in the world? And 
<PB N="258" REF="256"/> then, as if a single spark of virtue—which God
knows I honestly believed had no existence but in idea—was likely to
check this worthy belief, in stept Mr. Standfast, who assured me that
no man, not born to a fortune, ever rose to one without certain talents,
which he called superior genius, but which I now denominate
rascality.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'In short, I was to be placed about you as a
sort of evil genius, and to give me as much power as possible over you,
that is to say, as much hold as possible on your generosity, you were
to seduce my sister, and I was to overlook it; whereas I never had a
sister, nor was that woman any more than a common creature of the town. In
short, all you saw at my house was a delusion, calculated for the
purpose of introducing you to me, and giving you fresh apparent proofs of
Mr. Standfast's attach∣ment, probably lest you should discover the
vil∣lany he happened then to be practising against your father.'</Q></P>
<P>Here Mr. Figgins gave a copious detail of all the reader knows
already, relative to the measures carried into effect by him and Standfast,
both a∣gainst Charles and his father; honestly stating how far he took
shame to himself in this business, <PB N="259" REF="257"/> and shewing
when he first began to feel repug∣nance.</P>
<P>In short, he did not omit a circumstance which I have
already related; and having fairly opened our hero's eyes as to Gloss, Sir
Sidney, and every one else, concluded with assuring him that the ba∣ronet
was ready to take him heartily by the hand, make him a concession for his
unkind and unme∣rited coolness, and beg to be admitted into his friendship
with more warmth than ever.</P>
<P> Figgins wound up this period pretty warmly, and then added, 
<Q REND="inline">'to which happy reconciliation it is needless
to say will succeed your marriage with Annette, from which
pleasure—due alone to two such hearts—may I ever be excluded,
if I cease to be worthy its contemplation.'</Q></P>
<P>To this succeeded a conversation consisting en∣tirely of
remarks. The whole of Standfast's con∣duct was taken piece meal, and
commented on, as far as it was consistent with Figgins's compact with Emma,
and Charles plainly saw that, but for that vi∣per, both his father and mother
might have been alive, in all probability, at that moment.</P>
<P>As to Figgins himself, Charles did not choose to 
<PB N="260" REF="258"/> let his opinion of him take date earlier than his
reformation, since which he was charmed with every action.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER VI.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>WHICH WILL BOTH PLEASE AND AFFECT THE READER.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>Sir Sidney and his family were by this time in Warwickshire.
Nothing however, hard as his in∣clination spurred him, could induce Charles
to pay his respects to the baronet before he discharged his debts in
London. He panted to find himself once more a free man in his own country.
Sending Mrs. Marlow therefore before him, whose presence was particularly
wished—for more than one rea∣son—by Emma, our hero and Figgins
visited all the quondam proprietors of the impartial news∣paper, and paid
off their demands; nor did they beget a little consternation among them by
saying that the cause was now taken up in so spirited a manner, that a
public print would shortly come out, which must be the inevitable
destruction of all the rest; for it would expose their partiality, their
bribes, their connections, together with all the names of those who were
their supporters and abet∣tors, and, in short, their whole arcana, from
such <PB N="262" REF="260"/> authority as the whole world would know in a
mo∣ment to be authentic.</P>
<P>So far did they carry this, that hand bills were immediately
dispersed, holding out, in such feasi∣ble terms, a plan for the
destruction of these diurnal locusts, that private terms of conciliation
came to them from two or three of the most vulnerable, which they, to foment
the matter still more, pub∣lished in a second hand bill.</P>
<P>At length, having enjoyed a complete laugh at them, and been
joined by the town, they went into the country, and left them sweating with
sus∣pense.</P>
<P>The meeting between Charles and Sir Sidney was truly affecting.
The noble candour of the ba∣ronet, the manly honesty of his
self-accusation, had in it a dignity of soul highly admirable. He thought
nothing a condescension which could serve to assure his young friend
how deeply he felt the recollection of his former slights and suspicions;
nor did he spare either his penetration or his justice, for hav∣ing
admitted them, for a single moment, to take place in his mind.</P>
<P>He declared he had ever held it as a maxim that 
<PB N="263" REF="261"/> the most glorious moment of a man's life was that in
which he acknowledged and repented of an error; and so heartily was he, at
that instant, ashamed of his conduct in relation to Charles, that he
should never have forgiven himself if it had not convinced him, at the
same time, of his valuable friend's unparalleled virtue: that it was the very
fire out of which that virtue came pure from the trial.</P>
<P>Charles, who endeavoured in vain to prevent this declaration,
had nothing for it but to palliate the blame Sir Sidney had so handsomely
thrown on himself. He said, under such delusive influence, it was
impossible but he must have fallen in with the opinion of others; for
that the very goodness of his heart would naturally incline him to credit
so many well confirmed circumstances. It was the business of those
who had attempted his downfal to stick at nothing. They had their private
motives, of which it was impossible he should see the extent; nay, as
their villanies involved so many important circumstances, a nice
investigation of which was necessary to effect their detection, it was
extremely difficult, as well as dangerous, for a friend, though ever so
zealous, to offer any thing in his defence; while, on his side, conscious
of the integrity of his <PB N="264" REF="262"/> own motives, Sir Sidney must
ultimately have con∣demned him as deficient in every delicate feeling if he
appeared forward to deprecate anger which he had neither provoked nor
merited.</P>
<P>He said much more to this purpose, and con∣cluded with
entreating Sir Sidney to believe that could he have satisfied his own
susceptibility, there was no moment during the whole time he had the
misfortune to labour under his ill opinion, that he would not have gone any
length to have effected a reconciliation. That reconciliation was now, he
thanked God, complete, without any conduct de∣rogatory to the honour of either,
and it should be the business of his life to preserve so valuable a
friendship uninterrupted.</P>
<P>Lady Roebuck received Charles as the son of her deceased
friend. She found him just what she wished, but not more than she
expected. She thanked heaven that so perfect a good understanding had
happily taken place, and declared, except a tinge of unhappiness at the
situation of Annette, she had not now another wish to gratify.</P>
<P>Emma did no more than receive her king, and render him her
allegiance. She told him he was <PB N="265" REF="263"/> welcome; welcome as the
rain to MARCUS AU∣RELIUS; though, like that, he came a little of the latest:
but that it was not a time to talk, for, like that general she had mentioned,

<Q REND="inline">"now they were refreshed, they had yet a
battle to gain."</Q></P>
<P>A consultation on the measures necessary to be taken was
now proposed; previous to which how∣ever Charles warmly entreated to see
Annette, with whose melancholy situation Figgins and Mrs. Mar∣low had
gradually acquainted him. He was told the sight of her would greatly shock
him; that she knew nobody; that she was continually buried in profound
meditation; and yet there was a distinc∣tion in her manner of noticing
those who were near her: if it could be called noticing them; for she
testified less melancholy when Emma was present than any other person,
except Mrs. Marlow, upon whom she would sometimes look and sigh.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Oh God,' said Charles, and shall such
angelic sweetness be lost to the world! Does she never
speak?'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Never,' said Lady Roebuck, 'any thing but one
remarkable sentence, which we will not an∣ticipate: you shall hear it from
herself.'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="266" REF="264"/> Charles's curiosity was now whetted to
its keenest edge, and he most servently entreated he might immediately
see her.</P>
<P>Emma undertook to enquire if it was a proper time, and returned
with information that she was then lying asleep, with her head on Mrs.
Marlow's lap. Charles begged he might see her in that situ∣ation, which
would take off, in some degree, the shock of his first interview, and
afterwards, leaving her undisturbed, he should be more calm, and better
prepared to bear a second.</P>
<P>This being agreed to, they all repaired to a draw∣ing room,
where the beautiful insensible lay on a sofa, reclined in sleep, in the
exact situation that Emma had described.</P>
<P>Charles devoured her lovely form with his eyes. It was the
Annette he had seen covered with inno∣cent confusion at Aix la Chapelle; it
was she who tore his heart with apparently unjust anger the night before he
left England; it was she he had seen in so many delusive dreams; she
for whom he had vented so many unavailing sighs; she his soul adored;
she for whom alone he wished to live; she whom he was doomed—though
now found—to lose for ever.</P>
<P><PB N="267" REF="265"/> These were the glowing ideas which our
hero felt, but dared not utter. It was Annette he be∣held; and yet her pallid
cheek—which spoke at once her distress and
resignation—forced from him first a starting tear, then a profound
sigh, and after∣wards, in spight of all his efforts, an exclamation of 
<Q REND="inline">'Oh heavenly God, do I live to see
this!'</Q></P>
<P>At these words Annette started from her sleep, looked
wildly round her, then upon the ground. then sighed, then played with her
hair, then starting from the sofa, walked towards the window, re∣placed
herself on the sofa, sighed again, and then significantly moving her
head, she exclaimed, 
<Q REND="inline">'Oh no—I am sure my poor Charles is not
a villain.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'And is this the sentence I was to hear?'
cried Charles. 'And can my Annette think of me! In madness think of me!
Kindly think of me! I cannot bear it. No my life,' cried he, throwing himself
at her feet, 'your Charles is not a villain: he loves you tenderly; dearly
loves you; and would give his life to purchase for you a single glimpse
of returning reason. Look on me my Annette! Speak to me! She will
not!'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'My dear Mr. Hazard, you have greatly agi∣tated
her,' said Lady Roebuck. 'Heaven send <PB N="268" REF="266"/> it may be a
fortunate symptom. At present I think we had better leave her. Mrs. Marlow
will give us an account of the effect this interview has on her
spirits.'</Q></P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER VII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>LAUDABLE DUPLICITY AND A MAD SCENE.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WHILE these matters were carrying on at Sir Sidney's, Gloss
was occupied, or at least appeared to be so, in discharging his public
duty, and giving ministerial dinners. Nor did this great man dream, while he
feasted upon muffins and paragraphs for breakfast, in London, that a
stroke was meditating in Warwickshire which all his influence, backed with
all his cunning, would be found ultimately insufficient to parry.</P>
<P>He knew of Charles's marriage, and therefore was not at all
surprised either that he should return and discharge his
debts—for no man had it more clearly in his power than Mr. Gloss to
ascertain that Charles was a man of strict honour—or that he should
threaten to take vengeance on the venal herd of diurnal scribblers; for he
also well knew that our hero was both capable of planning such a
casti∣gation, and resolute enough to inflict it.</P>
<P><PB N="270" REF="268"/> To say the truth, the necessity he
should lie under, as he conceived, of learning our hero's measures, and
being active in circumventing them, together with the pains he took to quiet
those who feared they should smart under the lash that seemed to be
preparing for them, and which their own fears mag∣nified into something
worse than that they richly merited at the cart's tail, induced Mr. Gloss
to overstay his appointment with Sir Sidney, who, by the advice of
Emma—without whose concurrence nothing of moment was now
undertaken—wrote him a letter, and gently upbraided him for neglect∣ing
his private concerns, though, at the same time, it was impossible, the
letter said, too much to ad∣mire that public virtue which was the cause of
it.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Stupid dotard,' said Gloss to himself, as
he read the letter, 'I have infatuated the old block∣head.'</Q> What however
would he have said had he known that in return for the treachery by which he
had influenced Sir Sidney to write that unjust letter to Charles, when in
France, Charles himself stood at the elbow of Sir Sidney, and approved of
the ho∣nest duplicity contained in the letter now written, as a snare to
detect his villany.</P>
<P>In order to this detection, and indeed to the de∣tection of a
great deal more, as it was necessary to <PB N="271" REF="269"/> tread on
very tender ground, the confederacy agreed that Charles and Figgins should
take up their resi∣dence at a distance from Sir Sidney's, that Emma
should appear gradually to waver in her sentiments, on the representation
of Mrs. Marlow, who was to tell a long story of having left him, in
consequence of improper conduct to her daughter. This, in particular, was hit
upon, as it would be taking the very tone Gloss had himself often
sounded.</P>
<P>These resolutions, and a letter received from Mr. Gloss,
informing Sir Sidney that he would wave all considerations of engagements
with ministers, offices, councils, and levees, to attend the more welcome
duties of love and friendship, induced the two friends to be expeditious in
taking their departure; previous to which, however, Charles earnestly
so∣licited one more interview with Annette.</P>
<P>She had manifested uncommon inquietude ever since she had
been so agitated at the sight of Charles, nor could all their endeavours,
though she conti∣nued perturbed and restless, induce her to utter a
syllable, unless he was shewn to her at a distance, which he had been
three or four times, by the ad∣vice of the physicians. Upon one of these
occa∣sions she cried, 
<Q REND="inline">'It is false, that's not Gloss:'</Q> and 
<PB N="272" REF="270"/> upon another, she uttered in a scream, 
<Q REND="inline">'Hide your∣self, hide yourself in France:
they'll put you in prison.'</Q></P>
<P>At length they kept him from her, and then she began to be
inquisitive concerning him. In one of these moods he appeared before her,
and, for a short interval, while she ceased her loquacity, and was lost
in profound meditation, he looked on her with inexpressible tenderness,
heaving an agonizing sigh, and sheding a burning tear. The sigh
at∣tracted her attention, and, as she vacantly regarded him, she cried, 
<Q REND="inline">'Who are you? If you were not lovely, like my
Charles, I should call you Gloss. He sighs, he sheds tears; but his
sighs carry the contagion of a pest, and his tears are the tears of a
crocodile. Sir I have the best father in the world. He married me to one
villain, to protect me, as he said, from another. Is the vulture a kinder
friend to the lamb than the eagle? But see how people may be deceived! It was
only a deceitful mirror; a false medium; for, sir, ca∣lumny is not content
with wounding, but poison must follow the bite. But why wound
me?—Pity that excessive tenderness should inflict misery. I
must never smile again, else I could laugh out to think that the best
wisdom will sometimes sink <PB N="273" REF="271"/> to the worst folly,
for Sir Sidney Roebuck is my father. I have two mothers, yet no mother at all.
They are both angels: one of them in hea∣ven, as some think, and the
other—Oh! No man but my father could deserve two angels. He is an angel
himself. I was right then to marry Gloss. I was right to obey my father. I
will sa∣crifice my life for him, but I won't sacrifice my un∣derstanding
for any body. Sir unhand me; there is not a word of truth in all you say. You
soar above him! Grovel, lay prostrate, like your soul, in villanous
filth. You traduce him! Did all the fiends, your fellows, surround me, did a
thousand deaths await me, were I obliged to give you my hand in marriage, I
would abash you, I would strike you to the soul, I would chill you with
horror, and say—that my poor Charles is not a villain.'</Q></P>
<P>Here she was seized with strong convul∣sions, and then
put to bed; after which re∣course was immediately had to medical
assist∣ance.</P>
<P>The next day she became more composed, and, at intervals,
had some dawn of reason.—Charles however was carefully kept from her,
es∣pecially <PB N="274" REF="272"/> as she appeared in imminent danger,
which circumstance also, out of tenderness, was carefully kept from
him.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER VIII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>PROVES THAT THE LANDLORD'S OBSERVATION, AT THE JOHN OF GAUNT'S
HEAD—THAT HUMAN CREATURES ARE LIKE BUCKETS IN A WELL—WAS WELL
FOUNDED.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>As there are a prodigious number of circum∣stances which I
must now clearly, and therefore gradually, develope, I shall regularly
bring for∣ward such characters as may be useful to me in the prosecution
of this task: and first, Mr. Balance, whom I certainly did not intend to
celebrate as an honest lawyer upon the credit of one or two upright actions;
for I must have been a novice indeed had I not known that the evidence ought
to be very strong and convincing that could substantiate so un∣common a
fact.</P>
<P>Let it be known that Mr. Balance began to en∣tertain a tolerable
good opinion of Charles earlier than many others of his friends; and it arose
from this circumstance. When he received an order to grant Figgins that
annuity of a hundred pounds, <PB N="276" REF="274"/> formerly spoken of, our
hero was certainly in the worst disgrace with him, and this matter
remaining unexplained for a considerable time, nobody was forwarder than Mr.
Balance to blame his conduct in the presence of Sir Sidney; nay I question
whe∣ther Mr. Gloss himself did him, as far as it went, more injury in the
opinion of the baronet; for even Emma could not consider him as interested
in his affairs: but as it is the nature of goodness to enu∣merate the errors
of others with reluctance, so it is to feel the warmest anxiety to atone
for its own.</P>
<P>So it happened with Mr. Balance. When Fig∣gins called upon him,
not more to receive his three hundred and fifty pounds, which were due to him,
and which we have seen him so handsomely refuse to appropriate to his
own use, than to solicit his hearty concurrence in Emma's measures, he
was so charmed with Figgins's self-condemnation, and the brilliant
character he gave of his friend, that he very naturally asked—and
indeed the reader will ask too—why he had not come to him sooner.</P>
<P>It has been seen, however, that what Figgins and Emma were
agitating was of two great a magni∣tude to be slightly touched on; but a
circumstance happening, just at that time, which gave them 
<PB N="277" REF="275"/> reason to believe that Mr. Balance would not only be a
very useful, but a very willing assistant—for I have said that
his foible, though an attorney, was to detect rascality—Figgins paid
him a visit, and, after an hour's conversation, that gentleman inlisted
under Emma's banners.</P>
<P>Had not our hero decamped to France in that precipitate manner,
a few days from that period might have made him happy in the possession
of Annette; to achieve which enterprize, Figgins, as we have seen, called at
his house. The necessary steps however to bring about that desirable
event, if it should ever take place, requiring his presence, they were
obliged to be deferred. He is now upon the spot, and I beg the reader's
attention while I trace out those steps one by one.</P>
<P>Scarcely had Charles and Figgins situated them∣selves in
their new residence, when Mr. Balance called on them, with whom—in
company with some necessary persons employed on the
occasion—they proceeded to Hazard house, and knocked very
peremptorily at the door.</P>
<P>Finding the Lady Dowager alone, Mr. Balance told her that he
came vested with authority to re∣store the rightful Lord Hazard to his
title and es∣tate, <PB N="278" REF="276"/> which information the lady affected
at first not to understand, and afterwards to treat with great contempt;
but being told that Mr. Tadpole was in custody, and had made an ample
confession, she seemed greatly shocked. Catching however at every
straw, she endeavoured still to stem that tor∣rent which seemed ready
to engulph her, nor would acknowledge any thing; till at length, being told
that the sum of Mr. Tadpole's confession was that he had been legally
married to her ten years, that consequently her subsequent marriage with
Lord Hazard was illegal, her children illegitimate, and, of course, that no
bar stood between Charles and the possession of his title and
fortune, she acted a part something in the same style in which we were
sometime ago so amused with the vagaries of Mrs. O'Shocknesy.</P>
<P>Now the fact was that Mr. Tadpole was not in custody, nor had
he made any confession. He was only kept out of the way by one of Kiddy's
cute manoovres, as he called it, who, to be plain, hav∣ing been sometime an
accessary, and at length a principal, in Emma's plots, suggested the
pro∣perest mode of carrying this one into effect; for, said Kiddy, 
<Q REND="inline">'if we attack the rum squire, he will be peery
and prevaricative, but if we whiddle a little to ma'am, though she is as fly
as Satan, <PB N="279" REF="277"/> guilt will fly in her face, the pearls will
trickle, and we shall have her as snug as be damned.—Lord forgive me
for uttering such a word.'</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Tadpole, as had been concerted, in due time made his
appearance. He bounced and flew about, but being convinced, by incontrovertible
documents, that he was completely discovered, be∣came at length tame, and
threw himself on our hero's mercy, who put a finish to the business, by
assigning Mr. Tadpole and his lady, for the pre∣sent, that residence he
had taken for Figgins and himself, and assuring them that though he
should enter into a severe scrutiny of all their conduct re∣lative to the
management of the estate, since it had been in their hands, yet, on account
of his bro∣ther's children, the justice he should be obliged to use,
should be tempered with as much mercy as the nature of such a case would
admit.</P>
<P>Here let me, for the sake of truth, relate a most
extraordinary trait of superior female cunning. I have said that Mrs.
Tadpole—for we shall call her so in future—had her doubts as to
who slept with her at Lisle, but that those doubts had subsided, and
that at length she had fully believed it could be no other than Charles. Can
it be credited that she was inspired with hope, from the recollection of 
<PB N="280" REF="278"/> this circumstance, and that she flattered herself,
should she take a favourable opportunity of repre∣senting it privately, a
repetition of the crime might give her a power over him! What a pity that
Figgins, who thought, as Kiddy has it, ploughing with the heifer might work out
something for the general good, should undeceive her, which he did, and
so render all her schemes abortive.</P>
<P>The documents which were explained to Mr. Tadpole, I shall now
explain to the reader. It will be remembered that Kiddy, on his return to
England, called on Mr. Standfast, with an inten∣tion of giving up Mr.
Tadpole, but that he sud∣denly altered his resolution, attached himself
to that gentleman, and gave up his benefactor. Kiddy knew of the marriage of
Mr. and Mrs. Tadpole, and it must have been something of a very particu∣lar
nature indeed, predetermined as he was to dis∣close it, that could prevent
him from doing so.—The fact however is as I have related it, and it was
not till the nice train of circumstances, con∣ducted by Emma, carried into
effect by Swash and his daughter, and at length supported by Figgins, had
properly worked upon him, that he wavered in his attachment; but, even when he
had done so, nothing could be adduced against Tadpole but Kiddy's ipse
dixit, which was grounded upon a <PB N="281" REF="279"/> confession of the
gentleman and lady, during a squabble, when they were in France, and when
they thought Kiddy out of ear-shot.</P>
<P>Without collateral evidence therefore nothing could be done.
This Kiddy contrived to procure, and it was not long before he suspected
that he should get at it through a gentleman who, in a very importunate way,
would sometimes call on Mr. Tadpole; for some hints that constantly
passed be∣tween that worthy wight and his lady, after he was gone,
convinced Flush that he knew something of their private affairs.</P>
<P> One day, as this gentleman was descending the staircase,
after a long and pretty loud conversation with Tadpole, the latter followed
him, saying, 
<Q REND="inline">'You may make yourself very easy, for I will
send to you on Wednesday by the post.'</Q></P>
<P>This was heard by Kiddy from the butler's pan∣try, into which
pantry, on the following Wednes∣day, he coaxed the footman, who was
entrusted with the letter, and, after giving him, as he called it, his
dose, he contrived to get the letter from him, under a pretext of looking at
the direction, and then exchanged it for another, which he had 
<PB N="282" REF="280"/> previously written, and which the poor footman, who,
as Kiddy knew, could not read, carried to the post-office.</P>
<P>Kiddy's letter was as follows: 
<LETTER>
<HEAD>TO THE REVEREND Mr. FIGGINS.</HEAD>
<P> WE begin to be down upon them, the Lord be praised. I
shall tell you all how and about it to-morrow. Blow me, Mr. Figgins, if I
don't think this repentance will be the saving of my precious soul.</P>
<CLOSER>
<SIGNED>Thy brother sinner, K. FLUSH.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER></P>
<P> As soon as Flush was alone he broke open the other letter,
the cover of which was directed "To Mr. Skinks," and described his
residence in London. It contained these words. 
<LETTER>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SKINKS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P> I have considered the matter, and really think you are
too peremptory. What I have pro∣mised is very handsome, and I will not
consent to a tittle more. If you think it will better suit 
<PB N="283" REF="281"/> your purpose to turn about, do so, with all my
heart. If you know my secrets, recollect that yours are also known to
either—at your own op∣tion—your firm friend, or determined
enemy</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>TIMOTHY TADPOLE.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER></P>
<P>This letter, by the advice of Emma, was imme∣diately conveyed to
Figgins, who, upon consulting with Mr. Balance, and putting different
circum∣stances together, began to have a strong suspicion that he
himself had lent a helping hand in the busi∣ness of Mr. Tadpole's
marriage.</P>
<P>Tadpole, as the reader knows, was an attorney's clerk. Be it now
known that Skinks was an attor∣ney's clerk also, but having been guilty,
since the expiration of his article, of many nefareous practices, in the way
of his profession, he became, among many other rogues of the same
description, well known to Mr. Balance, who happening just at that time to
have him under his thumb, told Figgins that he had no doubt but he should
bring him to reason.</P>
<P>Figgins consented to use Mr. Balance's authority as a
<HI>corps de reserve,</HI> but thought it a good thing previously to worm a
confession out of Shinks him∣self. <PB N="284" REF="282"/> For this
purpose he called on him, and pre∣tended that he was commissioned by
Tadpole to settle, once for all, their dispute.</P>
<P>As Figgins familiarly mentioned the business of the
marriage, and ventured a few guesses at circum∣stances which might
probably belong to it, the other entered into the business candidly enough,
till at length Figgins's suspicions were confirmed, and he was enabled to
speak to it from his own knowledge; for he found it to be this.</P>
<P>When he was a bridewell boy, he was applied to by a gentleman to
carry him and another up the river, in one of those barges which it is well
known the bridewell boys are very expert at rowing.</P>
<P>This expedition was to Wandsworth. It was conducted in the
night, and Figgins and another, who were let into the secret, understood
that it was set on foot for the purpose of stealing a young lady from a
boarding school, and that the friend of the gentleman who hired the barge was
to be married to her.</P>
<P>Being at that time anxious to get at as much of this secret as
possible—probably from as honest a reason as that which now
impelled the conduct of <PB N="285" REF="283"/> Mr. Skinks, he took the proper
methods, which he could do as cunningly as any body, to trace the conduct of
the parties, and soon found where the marriage rites were performed.</P>
<P>This however accomplished, and concealment being no longer
necessary, Figgins profited in no way, at that time, by the intelligence he
had been so solicitous to procure. It being now however singularly
serviceable to his friend, he rejoiced that it had struck him to use
it.</P>
<P>The reader is now ready to ask why Mr. Figgins did not
recollect all these circumstances at Lisle? To which I answer that
Tadpole's real name was Poach, which, when he first conceived that very
honest intention of marrying his wife to Zekiel, he warily changed, that he
might be the less liable to a detection; and, as to their persons, he did
not see either of them at the time of the elopement but very imperfectly,
having never been in their com∣pany but between the hours of eleven o'clock at
night and five in the morning.</P>
<P>Skinks however, who managed every thing, he recollected
perfectly well, both as to his name and his person, and the whole
business would long be∣fore <PB N="286" REF="284"/> have occured to him but
for the change of Poach into Tadpole.</P>
<P>Pretending to leave the negociation open be∣tween Skinks and
Tadpole, he hastened to Mr. Ba∣lance, who, first imposing the most
profound si∣lence upon Skinks, under pain of inflicting that punishment he
knew he had incurred, procured all those documents, the sight of which, as
I have said, so completely silenced Tadpole, consisting of a
cer∣tificate of the marriage, an avowal of every thing under Skinks's
hand—which he readily gave upon reading Tadpole's letter—and a few
other necessary matters.</P>
<P>Thus, having made my hero a lord, and given him a noble
estate, I shall proceed to see whether he stands a chance of ever
possessing that content without which, in the opinion of many, grandeur
and riches are only a substitute for happiness.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER IX.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>A GOOD DEAL OF BUSTLE, A HEROIC MOTHER, AND TWO OR THREE
NOTABLE DISCOVERIES.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>As I flatter myself the reader will give me credit for a
complete knowledge of the power and effect of contrast, it will not be
thought impolitic in me to bring forward our old friend Standfast, in
oppo∣sition to Mr. Balance. But, exclusive of this arti∣ficial way of
introducing him, I have now a very natural one; for, as this history is
drawing apace towards its conclusion, it certainly could not have been
complete had I neglected to record, in the fullest manner, what became of a
character who had filled in it so distinguished a situation.</P>
<P>Mr. Standfast and his lovely partner, since their mortifying
disappointment on Zekiel's accession to his fortune, had figured away
with various success. At one time they were rolling in splendour, at
an∣other frightened at bailiffs, till, having been con∣cerned 
<PB N="288" REF="286"/> in pharaoh banks, E O tables, lottery offi∣ces, and
every species of gambling, either brilliant or contemptible, according as
their circumstances varied, they were at length reduced to the most
mortifying poverty.</P>
<P>Just at that time the change of the ministry, as I have
already recorded, placed Gloss—who, be it known, had never turned tall
on his old friends—in a responsible situation under government.
They now resolved that Mr. Standfast should become a contractor, by which
means they very soon re-esta∣blished themselves in tolerable opulence;
and here a very striking reflection presents itself, that just as the
pupil, Charles, was compelled, by the loss of his fortune, to quit the worthy
employment of dis∣pensing benefits, and relieving the necessities of
the poor and oppressed, the tutor, Standfast, should make a fortune by
administering to folly and wick∣edness, and oppressing and grinding the
unfortunate and necessitous.</P>
<P> In this situation had they for some time conti∣nued, when
Charles's sudden advancement to a coronet gave them to fear that something
was 
<Q REND="inline">"rot∣ten in the state of Denmark."</Q> What
however they could not devise. Sir Sidney had certainly <PB N="289" REF="287"/> taken careful measures to appear perfectly indiffer∣ent as to what
concerned Charles, but yet it was a moot point with Gloss whether he was a
friend or an enemy; for, as Annette was carefully kept from him, and Emma, in
spight of all her caution, could not help occasionally a little exultation,
his arts—especially as it was necessary to lay them on thicker than
ever, and as every body knew them to be so many barefaced
falsitics—were so apparent that it really became an irksome task
to have him about the baronet's family, although they were under the
necessity of doing so till they should be able to ac∣complish their
<HI>coup de grace.</HI></P>
<P>About this time he received a letter from Stand∣fast, which
informed him that the ministry were again tottering. He therefore hastened
to town, and finding that the intelligence was but too true, a scheme was
concerted between these amiable friends to embezzle certain monies, which
they well knew where to lay their hands on, and decamp into a foreign
country.</P>
<P>This however could not be effected without the previous
concurrence of certain men called clerks, in whose possession were
books and tallies, and other documents, by means of which alone they could
obtain a right to receive these said monies.</P>
<P><PB N="290" REF="288"/> These documents they hoped to procure
through the influence of our old friend Viney, who had held a lucrative
situation under Gloss ever since he first came into office, but a
younger clerk, who happened to be a youth of honour and spirit, and who had
very nearly been put out of office because he had threatened to chastise
this old sinner, for most scan∣dalous conduct to his sister, a
beautiful girl of thir∣teen, conjectured by circumstances what was going
forward.</P>
<P>In short, in attempting to possess himself of the
necessary papers, Viney plainly found, by the steps that had been taken
to prevent his intentions, that he was discovered, and therefore, lest he
should be involved in the guilt, went directly and gave in∣formation
against his two friends, who, holding his conduct in equal distrust, got
intelligence of his treachery in time, as they imagined, to ward off its
consequences.</P>
<P>Neither Standfast nor Gloss had been idle, for though they
could not accomplish their grand point, they nevertheless got together a
pretty round sum, which was at that moment deposited in Standfast's
bureau, and, as a <HI>coup de maitre,</HI> it was agreed that Gloss should
force Annette from her father, with <PB N="291" REF="289"/> an idea that after
possession, by means of marriage, or any other means, Sir Sidney would
not only be glad enough to make peace with them, but give his daughter a
fortune. These were his words when he proposed the matter to
Standfast.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'As to the boy Charles, he can never marry her:
but this is no time for investigation. As to Sir Sidney, he will be glad
enough to come to terms, when the injury is in any other way irreparable. If
not, she is the only woman I ever loved, and if possession should
cloy that love, she is very beau∣tiful, and will always fetch a good
price.'</Q></P>
<P>I do not know that I have ever before made Mr. Gloss speak
without disguise, and I almost hope, even now, that the reader will
disbelieve that such a man could ever impose upon Sir Sidney. But nothing
can be clearer than that such conduct is not only in nature, but that it is
practised every day, and practised successfully. Goodness neither
knows nor suspects the snares of villany, which covers itself in a veil
so truly the hue of virtue, and which, in this instance, wore so
completely that appearance to the eyes of Sir Sidney, that, till he saw, in
his last visit, the soul of Gloss in its own filthy colours, so free
was he from a practical know∣ledge of what qualities vice was formed, he did
not <PB N="292" REF="290"/> believe so vile a human monster could infest
the face of the earth.</P>
<P>The poor, fond, infatuated Standfast, on his part, was also
determined not to leave his partner behind him, and therefore, having
previously agreed with Gloss on a meeting place, hastened home, that,
like an obedient wife, she might pack up her alls, and accompany him.</P>
<P>Reader, I do not think I have given thee a more sensible
pleasure throughout this work than thou wilt now receive, when I inform thee
that he found his house in confusion, his bureau broken open and stript
of every thing, and the dear partner of his soul decamped with his kind
friend Dogbolt!</P>
<P>Were I perfect in the duty of a historian, I ought here to
describe that hell, his mind; but as no reader will be so unreasonable as
to expect a de∣scription of what no words can express, I shall con∣tent
myself with saying that no reprobate ever swore more volubly, no
dancing-master ever capered more curiously, no bedlamite ever raved more
in∣coherently. In the midst of this paroxism, he felt himself suddenly
held down by two men, who thinking, probably, that a strait waistcoat was
not strong enough to hold so violent a maniac, put him 
<PB N="293" REF="291"/> on a pair of hand-cuffs, and, with the assistance
of several others, carried him away in a hackney coach.</P>
<P>Mr. Gloss, on his part, made the best of his way into
Warwickshire, determined to carry off Annette, let what would be the
consequence. He knew he must act very craftily, and therefore took care
pro∣perly to instruct his emissaries, by one of whom—indeed the
very same gentleman who accompanied Annette to town in the chaise—he
received intelli∣gence that the young lady was much better, and now rode out
every morning, for an airing, either with Lady Roebuck, Emma, or Mrs.
Marlow.</P>
<P>When last Mr. Gloss had been in Warwickshire, he had taken
uncommon pains to insinuate himself into the good graces of this old lady,
who also ap∣peared to pay him extraordinary attention: to say truth, an
attention that rather bordered upon in∣quisitiveness, and which he would
have repulsed if it had not struck him that it might lead to the
ac∣complishment of this scheme, which, as his <HI>dernier resort,</HI> he
always had meditated.</P>
<P>He had now no doubts, could he get Annette at a distance from
home, through the connivance of Mrs. Marlow, but he should complete his
design. <PB N="294" REF="292"/> He thought he had discovered that the old
lady's passion was avarice, for he knew that the whole story of her
having quitted Charles on account of her daughter was trumped up; nay he had
told her so, and had got from her a reluctant confession that her
inducement to take that step was a wish to shelter herself comfortably
for the remainder of her life, at a distance from a turbulent young man, who,
though he had good qualities, would never do any good either for himself or
any one else.</P>
<P>Possessed, as he imagined, of so much of Mrs. Marlow's
private sentiments, he thought he might, without danger, tamper with her a
little further, and, for that purpose, sent a servant on horseback to
say generally, at Roebuck hall, that Mr. Gloss proposed to pay that place
a visit in the course of a few days, to which effect he also wrote a note
to Sir Sidney, but informed Mrs. Marlow privately, by another note, that he had
some most particular business with her, which he must explain that
even∣ing, and would attend her wherever she should ap∣point. He took care
however so to qualify that note, by introducing such circumstances
relative to her, that it must have told against her had she either
partially or generally shewn it to any one.</P>
<P>Mrs. Marlow made a great many difficulties, but 
<PB N="295" REF="293"/> at length consented to meet him at the bottom of the
garden, which, in fact, she did. He lamented his situation, said he
plainly saw that Sir Sidney would go with the stream, that she had
herself al∣lowed, in former conversations, that he was avari∣cious, and
therefore she must see the temptation a coronet held out would not be
resisted; that if he could be favoured with an interview with Miss
Roe∣buck, without her father's knowledge, he was sure he could lay such
convincing proofs before her of the propriety of his conduct, and the
impossibility, even now, that she could honourably become the wife of
that young upstart, as he had no doubt would conquer all scruples.</P>
<P>He promised Mrs. Marlow mountains if he suc∣ceeded, and at
length it was agreed that he should come upon them, as if by accident, the
following Thursday, at an appointed spot, before which time, Mrs. Marlow
told him, there would be no oppor∣tunity, as Lady Roebuck would, till then,
accom∣pany her daughter, and, on that morning, she would have a particular
engagement at home.</P>
<P>Those readers who are sorry to see this apparent
desertior of principles in Mrs. Marlow, will be more so when they are told
that, on the following Thursday, when she was to ride out with Annette, 
<PB N="296" REF="294"/> in order to keep the coast as clear as possible,
that Mr. Gloss might put his design in execution—for, not to
disguise the truth, he had, at a second inter∣view, informed her of the
whole—the moment Gloss appeared at a distance, she sent the
footman, for some purpose or other, back again: so that there was no one
to oppose what was agitating but an old and almost helpless coachman.</P>
<P>This being the signal agreed upon, Gloss sprang forward,
and seeing some horsemen on a hill before him, which he took for his
myrmidons, he soon came up to the side of the coach. Mrs. Marlow pretended
great surprise at seeing him, and, after some general conversation,
asked if he would not walk in. This he eagerly consented to, and the
coachman got down apparently to open the door.</P>
<P>Hearing horses, and seeing men in great coats, he now
expected to find the coachman seized, as had been agreed on, and the coach
box mounted by different men, to whom he had given such in∣structions. What
then must have been his asto∣nishment when he himself was seized, and
told there was a warrant against him for murder.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Who dares accuse me?' said Gloss very
pe∣remptorily.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'I dare,' said Emma, who personated 
<PB N="297" REF="295"/> Annette:</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'And I,' said Mrs. Marlow, 'who pre∣pared the
snare that brought you into the hands of justice. You are my son, and I
cut you off to cure my honour, as I would amputate an infected limb to
preserve my life.'</Q></P>

<PB REF="296"/>
<HEAD>CHAPTER X.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>A LITTLE RETROSPECTION, AN EXAMINATION, SOME HORROR, AND A
MOST MORTIFYING DISAPPOINTMENT.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE reader having seen that Mrs. Marlow, in∣stead of acting
the treacherous part of a faithless servant, had assumed all the
dignity of a Spartan mother, it may not be amiss for the satisfaction of my
readers to see how she became that mother.</P>
<P>It will easily be recollected that, in the second volume of
this history, I gave a hint that Emma had made a very singular discovery,
on hearing the particulars of Mrs. Marlow's story. This disco∣very was no
less than that Standfast was the very clergyman by whom that poor lady had
been se∣duced, through the connivance of her aunt, when little more than an
infant.</P>
<P>She recollected to have heard that there had been a similar
accusation against him when first he lived chaplain to Major Malplaquet,
and now, having <PB N="299" REF="297"/> learnt the maiden name of Mrs. Marlow,
she found that she must have been the innocent victim whom she had
always understood he had treated with un∣common cruelty. For the remainder of
her intel∣ligence, she received it first from Figgins, and af∣terwards,
through Swash, from Flush, who had lived with him at the time, and was in
the plot; but, as her communication with Kiddy had been ambiguous and guarded,
till some little time before the grand eclaircissement, she had only
learnt that Gloss was the precious fruit of that illicit amour in time to
make it the climax of her discovery to Sir Sidney.</P>
<P>The reader recollects—which will illustrate this matter
better—that while that close intimacy sub∣sisted between Charles
and Gloss, Figgins was of the party, who, from some circumstances that
came within his knowledge, learnt that Gloss did not go to the Cape of Good
Hope. This induced him to think oddly of his connexion with Mr. Standfast,
but he did not find it worth his while to investigate it till Emma went to
France, at which time he un∣dertook to gather all the intelligence he could for
her at home, that, had it been necessary to make her grand discovery
there, she might be in possession of facts of magnitude sufficient
to have induced Sir Sidney to discard Gloss. Thus she learnt, by a 
<PB N="300" REF="298"/> letter from Mr. Figgins, three days before the
busi∣ness of Aix la Chapelle, that Gloss was the son of Standfast,
but she never divined the rest, as I have just said, till after
repeated conversations with Mrs. Marlow, and Kiddy's confirmation of those
suspi∣cions that arose out of it.</P>
<P>Thus, in different stages of this business, she used
as much of this fact as she thought necessary for her purpose. She told
Annette, in France, she could blast Mr. Gloss's hopes whenever she
pleased; she told Mr. Gloss, before Sir Sidney, it would be seen WHO he
was; she imparted the secret to Mrs. Marlow; and, finally, through the
proper and heroic feeling of that good woman, she now held him her captive,
and was determined to give him up to that justice he had so studiously
laboured to abuse.</P>
<P>This connexion of father and son will naturally account for
the blended interest of Standfast and Gloss, and also for the
congeniality of their senti∣ments: nay it will take off an imputation from
me; for as I may be almost accused of representing na∣ture in too odious
a light, by bringing forward two characters so shockingly profligate, so
the proba∣bility of their being so is considerably strengthened when it
is found that the same blood ran in the veins of both; nay, such pains had
been mutually <PB N="301" REF="299"/> taken that the emulation of the son
might be worthy the instruction of the sire—for vipers and doves are
equally fond of their offspring—that it is not asto∣nishing Mrs.
Marlow should be so shocked with Gloss, at the time Charles was
arrested, or express that detestation which was inspired by the
remark∣able resemblance of both his person and manner to those of
Standfast.</P>
<P>But, says the reader, did it never occur to Mrs. Marlow that
this very same Standfast was her be∣trayer? There is great singularity in
this circum∣stance. Mrs. Marlow did not know Charles till he was nearly
ruined, and it cannot be forgotten that Standfast, giving up his situation
as an actor in this play of human life, had retired and become a prompter long
before that period. Therefore, not seeing him on the stage, she did not
know that there was any such person employed in the theatre. Charles never
detailed his affairs, and though she knew the sum of them, she was
ignorant of many of the particulars till she began to converse with Emma,
who, after all, was extremely cautious of letting her into so much of them as
might impede any of her measures. Therefore, it was not till after Charles
went to France the second time, and she had had frequent conversations
with Emma and Figgins, that she came at this truth, which, at 
<PB N="302" REF="300"/> that time, Emma was the more anxious to investi∣gate:
finding it would be a matter of infinite im∣port to ascertain that Mr.
Gloss was the son of Mrs. Marlow, by Standfast. And, on the other hand,
that I may make this matter perfectly clear, as Standfast went to Flanders
before the good lady in question was married, he never knew her by the name
of Marlow. I could have strengthened this elucidation, by noticing that
Standfast, like Atall in the play, had a different name, at that time, for
every different intrigue; but, as Mrs. Marlow knew him by his real name, I did
not chuse so to violate my historic veracity, as to make out a case by
the insertion of a falsity.</P>
<P>It now becomes necessary to illustrate two or three
points, that I may give a clear stage to some prin∣cipal actors, who are
presently to make their ap∣pearance.</P>
<P>I have said, in its place, and since hinted, that Kiddy had
been very much shocked at some propo∣sal or other made him by
Standfast; so shocked in∣deed that it wrought in him an entire
reformation, and attached him to the interest of his patron's de∣clared
enemy. I have also said that when Figgins went to expostulate with
Standfast, he, in the course of that expostulation, became witness to
such a <PB N="303" REF="301"/> scene of altercation, between that gentleman
and Mrs. O'Shocknesy, as begat some suspicions in his mind of a very
horrid nature.</P>
<P>I have all along represented Kiddy as a very weak, but not a
very wicked character. He had, from his low origin, his mean education, his
grovling propensities, been taught to consider Mr. Flush as a superior
genius; or, as he called it, geno; and thus he firmly believed that the
consummation of all human perfection was the accomplishment of a
well-digested fraud: but Kiddy always took care, as he phrased it, to draw
the line, lest, as he cun∣ningly observed, the line should draw him.</P>
<P>Thus, were your wife or daughter to be seduced, your purse
stolen, your reputation destroyed, by treachery and cunning, Kiddy would
lend a help∣ing hand with all the veins in his heart—his lan∣guage
again—but as to going upon the highway, or being guilty of any other
dishonest act, which the law denominates felony, in that case, no crown
lawyer ever knew better how to discriminate than Kiddy. And this the reader,
when he recollects his outset in life, will see he was taught by that
first of masters, experience.</P>
<P>In short, seeing men of the first fortunes and abili∣ties 
<PB N="304" REF="302"/> constantly employing them to impose upon their
friends and neighbours, he only looked upon it as self-defence to arm
himself with the same arts; for, said Kiddy, 
<Q REND="inline">'In this here world I can't, for my part, see
why a man has not a right to be as bad as his betters.'</Q></P>
<P>Having therefore such an aversion to a halter, no wonder
that Kiddy should be so affronted at a direct proposal from Standfast
to commit an act for which, had it been discovered, he must have been
hanged; nor was it an unnatural transition, fond as he had been of that fun
called human misery, to see, all of a sudden, that he had delighted in it
a little too much; but as, turn which way he would, he was in such a
situation that he could not help imposing upon somebody, he covered his
hypocrisy with the veil of religion, to rub off slighter sins, and
those that bore too heavy on his recollection, he drowned in a dram; for,
said Kiddy, 
<Q REND="inline">'though every coge is a nail in my coffin, if I
do but re∣pent before I am put into it, the grim jockies may screw me up and
welcome.'</Q></P>
<P>To shew however the prevalence of custom upon human nature,
Kiddy very little considered that in the midst of his repentance, he was
accessary to a fraud of great magnitude, namely, the keeping 
<PB N="305" REF="303"/> Charles out of his fortune: nor would he, in all
probability, ever have taken any steps to restore him to his right, had not
this laudable conduct, as we have seen, been suggested to him by Emma,
through Swash; nor even then, had not the mea∣sures to be taken involved in
them a positive necessi∣ty of imposing upon Tadpole. This last
imposi∣tion however, being on the side of honour and vir∣tue, Kiddy began
to feel, that however it might be clever to be a rogue, it was more comfortable
to be an honest man.</P>
<P>The repentance of Figgins, as the reader knows, was better
confirmed, though, as there is weakness in every kind of wickedness, so
it was certainly as∣sisted by finding, in consequence of what dropt
from Mrs. O'Shocknesy, that Standfast had himself perpetrated the very
crime which he had vainly persuaded Flush to commit.</P>
<P>One moment more, and the reader shall know what this crime
was, and also that it has been very often hinted to him.</P>
<P>It will be recollected that Standfast did not ac∣company Mrs.
O'Shocknesy into Warwickshire, probably as he was grown remarkably hipped, 
<PB N="306" REF="304"/> owing to his being led by his lady the life of a dog, as
Jerry Sneak calls it; and, as he was eternally tortured with his own
reflections, he might be afraid of ghosts. I have said they were driven to
the verge of poverty, from which nothing could relieve them but the death of
Lord Hazard. I then say 
<Q REND="inline">'what joy to find Lord Hazard no more.'</Q> The
reader is upon the point of asking 
<Q REND="inline">'By what means no more?'</Q> Again, I compare
Standfast to Barnwell, who murdered his benefactor, which indeed did
Standfast, or he must have been foully belied; for, just at the period to
which this history is now ar∣rived, he was, in company with his son
Gloss, brought before Sir Sidney for that murder.</P>
<P>Here it will appear that there was good reason for managing
so adroitly the delay, from the Mon∣day till the Wednesday, of Gloss's
pretended inter∣view with Annette. It has been said that there is no snare
for bringing a man into a scrape like a woman. This proved to be the case
both as to Standfast and as to Gloss: differently however; one was betrayed
by adhering to a fiend, and the other punished for aspiring to an
angel.</P>
<P>Standfast was taken into custody in town, through the
vigilance of Mr. Balance, but Gloss was not to be found; therefore, when Sir
Sidney discovered <PB N="307" REF="305"/> that he was in Warwickshire, it
required the inter∣vention of a few days to procure the warrant that had been
granted against him, as well as to bring Mr. Standfast to that spot where
the crime had been committed.</P>
<P>Let us now suppose Sir Sidney upon the bench, Charles, Mr.
Balance, and Figgins by his side, and Standfast and Gloss brought before
him, on a charge of that murder for which we have seen them appre∣hended.</P>
<P>Flush deposed what has been related concerning the
proposal made him by Standfast; Figgins ex∣plained the nature of his
suspicions, and his conse∣quent conduct; and Mr. Balance said, from the
pains he had taken to investigate the business, there could be no doubt,
as far as presumption went, but that the prisoners were guilty.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'And so presumption is all you have
against us!' said Gloss.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'And this,' said Standfast, 'upon the
evidence of a rascally servant, a false friend, and a meddling
attorney!'</Q></P>
<P> Here they became turbulently insolent, when the baronet,
commanding silence, and addressing him∣self to Standfast, said, 
<Q REND="inline">'Unhappy man, I have a <PB N="308" REF="306"/>
witness that shall strike terror to thy very soul; that,
presumptuously shameless as thou art, shall sicken thee with
horror! See who enters at that door!'</Q></P>
<P>Had Standfast seen a spectre, the spectre of Lord
Hazard, he could not have been more appalled.— 
<Q REND="inline">'By hell, it is all over!' said he to Gloss.
'I thought the rascal had been dispatched.'</Q></P>
<P>This witness was John, who was tutored, as we have seen, to
refuse the half guinea from Dogbolt, who was placed about Charles, at the
express stipu∣lation of Standfast—not only that his ruin might be
more certain, but that the conduct of Mr. Figgins might be well watched,
lest, as it happened in the case of Kiddy, he should not be staunch to
the in∣terest of the confederacy—who intercepted all the letters, who
returned expressly to murder his lord, who did not seem to arrive, however,
till two days after the murder was committed, who then, though callous to the
core, appeared to weep over his mas∣ter's corpse, but who had since lived
in such a state of agonizing horror and remorse, that he now came to make
an ample confession.</P>
<P>John, after displaying a natural and pathetic pic∣ture of his
own penitence, told a most horrid tale. <PB N="309" REF="307"/> By large
bribes, and larger promises, he had been prevailed upon to murder his old
master. For that purpose he stole into the house, on the fatal
morn∣ing, and took away the pistols which were hanging in Lord Hazard's bed
chamber. He afterwards surprised him in the garden; but he declared that,
when he looked in his poor, wronged, old master's face, which was now grown
pale and ghastly, ow∣ing, he had no doubt, to that distress which he
him∣self had caused, by so often falsely accusing his son, all his
resolution forsook him, and he had not the cruel courage to perpetrate the
deed. Standfast, seeing this, rushed from a shrubbery, where he had
concealed himself, lest they should miscarry; and, as Lord Hazard flew
to him for protection, and while he was in the attitude of lifting his hands
and eyes to heaven, that had mercifully sent such a friend to his
assistance, the unmanly, hardened, hellish monster cowardly murdered
him!</P>
<P>To this he added, that after the murder was ac∣complished, but
not till then—for Standfast was not fully satisfied with his
sanguinary exploit till he had convinced himself, by a cautious
examination, that there was no symptom of returning life—the mur∣derer
with great coolness placed the pistol that was discharged close to the
body, and put that which was yet loaded into the coat pocket, which is the 
<PB N="310" REF="308"/> precise situation in which the reader will recollect
they were found.</P>
<P>John also said that, fearing he should be hanged for the
part he had taken in this shocking business, he did, for some time,
whatever he was bid by Stand∣fast, and consented to any wickedness that
was pro∣posed to him; but his conscience being at last hea∣vily
loaded—for which he was often ridiculed, and sometimes threatened, by
Standfast—he was upon the point of giving himself up to justice,
when it struck him to consult his old friend Flush, who, he understood,
had repented, and then lived a religi∣ous life.</P>
<P>Flush, who, the reader knows, was at that time seeking for
every kind of evidence to serve Charles's cause, had known, John said, a
great deal of his former wickedness; and it was agreed that, at a proper
time, he should be called forward to atone for it, by a true confession
of all he knew concern∣ing the murder. 
<Q REND="inline">'That confession,' added John, 'I have now
made, and it has taken such a load off my conscience, that though all good
men must hate me here, and I dare not expect mercy here∣after, my poor heavy
heart will be something lighter, when I reflect that I have brought such a 
<PB N="311" REF="309"/> villain to justice, to revenge the murder of so good
a master.'</Q></P>
<P>John's repentance Standfast all along had not only feared, but
he had determined to guard against its consequences. He called him a
half-bred vil∣lain; one who would certainly one day or other squeak.</P>
<P>Impressed with these suspicions, he consulted Mrs.
O'Shocknesy upon the propriety of putting him out of the way. She, at a
proper time, to quiet him—which accounts for his exclamation just now
to Gloss—told him it had been done by Dogbolt; but indeed it was the
last thing Dogbolt would have done, or she permitted; for as that gentleman
and lady had, for some time, determined to get rid of Mr. Standfast, so
it did not appear to be their in∣terest to keep any witness out of the way
who, should it be necessary, might facilitate his being hanged.</P>
<P>The evidence being closed, Mr. Standfast was committed to
Warwick jail for the murder of Lord Hazard, and Mr. Gloss was told there was
not sufficient proof against him to criminate him.</P>
<P><PB N="312" REF="310"/> 
<Q REND="inline">'Then I demand my liberty,' said Gloss, very
exultingly.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Not quite so fast sir,' said Sir
Sid∣ney. 'You must be remanded to London, to an∣swer there a charge of
fraud and perjury.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Of which should I be convicted,' said
Gloss, 'I shall still be happier than your intended son in law. The
worst that can happen to me is to be sent to a prison, from whence, for
the world wants ta∣lents, I shall soon be released; after which I shall
cut as splendid a figure as the best, and drink the pleasurable cup of
life by perhaps flattering the foible of some fool who, like you, may pride
him∣self upon virtues attributed to his ancestors, which they probably
never possessed, while his portion shall be bitterness and
misery: for, to be com∣pletely happy, he must possess your daughter,
which he cannot do, having already married—her mother!'</Q></P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XI.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>VEXATION UPON VEXATION, AND SOME PRETTY WRITING TO PROVE THAT
CATASTROPHES OUGHT TO BE UNHAPPY.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>NOT a single returning day had passed since the
reconciliation between Charles and Sir Sidney but brought with it some new
proof to the latter how egregiously he had been imposed upon by Gloss,
and what noble firmness there must have been in the mind of our hero, who,
though he panted for an explanation, scorned to capitulate for it
disho∣nourably.</P>
<P>But what were Sir Sidney's feelings when he found that the knave
who had thus practised upon his credulity, was the son of him who, by a
long, cool, deliberate series of unexampled villany, had first ruined the
peace, and then destroyed the life, of his friend and benefactor.</P>
<P>Oh how he was roused! His good sense, his friendship,
his generosity, his every seeling seemed <PB N="314" REF="312"/>
insulted! And then the taunting impudence of that insinuation concerning
his ancestry, which, as Sir Sidney indulged it, was surely a right and
laud∣able pride; shewing by what means he had led him into a belief of the
most gross and palpable falsity. He felt affronted and ashamed, and was
at a loss to account for the motive that could have induced him to admit
such a creature into his conversation. He alike reproached himself for
having communicated with the viper, and thanked providence that had rescued
him from its fangs.</P>
<P>Yet, what was all this compared to that thunder∣bolt which
Gloss, in his wanton, wicked lust of mischief, had now hurled at these
happy friends! The pestiferous breath, as it uttered the terrible words,
affected the hearers like a contagion, and it is but too true that he had the
insulting, trium∣phant, unmerciful pleasure to see both Charles and Sir
Sidney appalled and confounded.</P>
<P>As the reader is of course full of anxious expec∣tation, I
shall now proceed to a nice investigation of all that train of
circumstances which led Mr. Gloss to the knowledge of whom our hero had
married.</P>
<P>The reader will instantly recollect that Sir Sid∣ney, 
<PB N="315" REF="313"/> at the latter end of the first book, speaks of a
lady in the convent that Annette, when an infant, used to call Mamma Le
Clerc. It will also easily be remembered that Mr. Ingot gave Lord Hazard an
account of a Madmoiselle Le Clerc, who had some business with Sir
Sidney, and that this ac∣count tallied so exactly with the story of
Annette's mother, as to confirm both Lady Hazard and Lady Roebuck in an opinion
that it could be no other than her.</P>
<P>This Lady, as we are informed by Emma, left some jewels at Sir
Sidney's, but she refused, at the instance of one of the gentlemen who
accompanied her, to leave a packet of papers.</P>
<P>I will now be honest enough to declare that this gentleman was
no other than Combrie, and his rea∣son for advising the lady not to leave
the papers, arose from a sear lest Sir Sidney should actually know who
she was, and discover what were then her intentions. The same reason
induced him to prevail on her not to see the baronet in town.</P>
<P>The third person, who was, as I have said, de∣puted by the
convent to receive the fortune, was our old friend Goufre, and it was from this
journey Combrie became so well acquainted with all his af∣fairs; 
<PB N="316" REF="314"/> nay he had attended the young lady with a view to have
surprised the vigilance of the procu∣reur, and have secured her fortune
when in En∣gland, which circumstance I also hint in the se∣cond volume;
but this, however, not being practi∣cable, he had afterwards recourse, as we
have seen, to other methods, which were attended with better success.</P>
<P>It has been related that, on Mrs. Hazard's mo∣nument, at
Rochester, were placed her maiden name, the name of her first husband,
and of that she owned when she died. This circumstance, su∣peradded to
some intelligence obtained from one of the firm of Bondham and
Co.—indeed the very gen∣tleman who afterwards went to Botany
Bay—con∣firmed Mr. Gloss's conjectures. He had however a great deal of
collateral intelligence: one of his emissaries having been constantly
stationed by the side of our hero, who, had he attempted to return to
England, had instructions to lay him by the heels, either in Flanders, or on
his arrival, just as might be most expedient to assist the purposes
of Mr. Gloss. Finding however that marriage had barred every passage that
could lead to the possession of Annette, he at first made himself
perfectly easy, but when he heard of the death of Mrs. Hazard, and found that
these impediments were removed, he was obliged <PB N="317" REF="315"/> to
cast about in his mind for fresh matter, and, after straining his
ingenuity, and putting a variety of circumstances together, taking a hint
from the name of Le Clerc upon the monument, he found out what I have no doubt
the reader will be heartily sorry for.</P>
<P>It will immediately occur to the reader that both Charles and
Figgins must have been acquainted with all this matter, and yet it is very
certain they were not. The history of Annette was known only to five
persons; namely, Lord and Lady Hazard, Sir Sidney and Lady Roebuck, and Emma.
Three of these did not know the whole truth. Thus, the name of Le Clerc was
never uttered to Charles nor Figgins as the name of Annette's mother, nor to
Sir Sidney as the maiden name of Mrs. Combrie; or, if it had, it probably would
not have induced any suspicion of so extraordinary and unlikely a
circum∣stance as this: for Le Clerc, in France, is as com∣mon a name as Smith
is in England.</P>
<P>It also looks singular that Charles should not know the
private story of his wife, or that she should be ignorant of his; but
she is mentioned early in life to have been engaged in an intrigue, and it is
probable that she thought youthful folly was not a proper thing for a
husband to be entrusted with, <PB N="318" REF="316"/> and as to him, I have
already noticed his remark∣able delicacy towards Annette, as well as that she
greatly commended him for it. Besides, had there been no other reason, the
state of Mrs. Hazard's mind and health must have been such as to have
precluded the smallest likelihood of retrospective investigation
between them on subjects which could only have been developed through the
medium of great curiosity and long intimacy, neither of which, as the reader
sees, obtained in the present case; and therefore nothing could be
further from the mind of either than that their union involved in it so
momen∣tous and mysterious a circumstance.</P>
<P>During the journey that Emma persuaded Sir Sidney to take into
France, it cannot be forgotten that every possible enquiry was made by the
baronet concerning Annette's mother. He however only learnt, as I there say,
Ingot's story, and also that Miss Le Clerc had shifted her quarters to
another convent, where they either could not or would not give any account of
her. The fact was, that as the elopement of a nun from a convent in France is
never, like a runaway from a boarding school in England, advertised in all
the newspapers, but, on the contrary, kept as snug as possible, their
enqui∣ries were looked upon as little more than imperti∣nent curiosity, which
will indeed be readily believed <PB N="319" REF="317"/> when it is considered
that the convent of our lady of the ascension at Nancy—which was the
very place our travellers went to—had been pretty well scandalized by
the business of Madame Combrie al∣ready, and therefore they were very
little likely to gather any intelligence from thence. Indeed the matter was
so taken in dudgeon, that had Sir Sid∣ney stayed any considerable time,
and repeated his solicitations, it is within possibility that he might
have been considered as an accessary to the fact of Combrie's procuring
the fortune from Goufre, and so have been accused of the very fraud which
he had been so angry with Charles for committing.—Thus, as we have
seen, he came away from France no wiser than he went there.</P>
<P>The reader will now see that, as the parties had no sort of
communication with each other, it was impossible they should compare
notes; consequently, no one of them, in such a length of time, had
en∣tertained the smallest suspicion of what now, in one moment,
appeared to be beyond a doubt.</P>
<P>I have two or three times hinted—for I did not chuse to
do any more—that Mrs. Combrie resembled Annette, and there are
several passages in this work where the reader would very strongly have
scented <PB N="320" REF="318"/> this game, if I had not opportunely put up
some other to divert his attention.</P>
<P>The blood hound Gloss, however, has at length sound it, and,
like all prey started by such sangui∣nary hunters, it leads us a tedious
chase, only to bring us to the knowledge of mischief.</P>
<P>To leave every thing but plain narration, never was there
apparent happiness so dashed by certain disappointment. Every
comparative circumstance served to confirm the fact, and misery seemed
now to confound the innocent with the guilty, till at length Emma herself,
after torturing probability by every ingenious and subtle investigation her
inven∣tion could supply—all which, at an earlier period, perhaps I
should have given at length—was com∣pelled to confess that there was
novelty in every thing relative to our lovers, for that, contrary to all
established rules, they were born to be virtuous and unhappy.</P>
<P>I know not if I have introduced any thing into this history
so truly pathetic as what it is now my reluctant duty to mention. The health
of Annette was only completely confirmed on that very day when the whole family
were convinced she could not bless him for whom alone she wished to
live, and <PB N="321" REF="319"/> she was welcomed to reason only to be
plunged into misery worse than madness. The delight that every one felt
at once more beholding the angelic inno∣cence of her soul conveyed by those
benevolent smiles which now spoke her thankful joy, was dashed with a
mixture of agony; sighs were mingled with congratulations; tears choked the
utterance of plea∣sure; an universal gloom pervaded those faces that fain
would have beamed with the willing smile of grateful transport; and every
one, out of pity, ad∣vised a suppression of that wretchedness which
no one could conquer.</P>
<P>Too plainly did poor Annette perceive the misery that these
inexperienced dissemblers vainly en∣deavoured to hide. Did she ask if
her father was well, yes was the answer, and a profound sigh fol∣lowed it.
One began to give her pleasure by an account of the reconciliation of Sir
Sidney and Charles, and interrupted the relation with a flood of tears. From
Sir Sidney, from Lady Roebuck, from Emma, from Charles himself, she found
no better comfort; till, at length, her gentle mind was so wounded and
distressed, that she seemed, like an innocent victim, recovered from
one torture to be tormented with another, still more ingenious.</P>
<P>However I may be partial to sportive writing, I 
<PB N="322" REF="320"/> really think that, in this place, it would be both
impertinent and unfeeling to tantalize the reader, who now begins to think that
I have introduced a set of characters which I hold up as models of vir∣tue
and goodness, only to reward them with un∣merited misery and hopeless
wretchedness; but I flatter myself I shall not be accused of this
unneces∣sary wantonness. I do no more than my duty, and against all
such censure I shall defend myself, by noticing that I undertook
nothing in this task but to record facts, and if I leave the more amiable
part of my groupe of characters as miserable as those whose practice has
been knavery and villany, I shall not, even in that case, have deserted
probability, nor have inculcated a useless lesson of morality, since
to leave goodness in distress, is to enforce that highest of moral
duties, resignation.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>WHICH CONCLUDES THIS HISTORY.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>Mr. Balance, who had been to town for the pur∣pose of seeing
that the prosecution against Gloss was properly carried on, was also
determined to search as deeply as possible into the truth of this unhappy
affair, and, while he was thus employed, it happened that he was called upon by
a gentle∣man who said he had very particular business with Sir Sidney, on
this very subject. With this gen∣tleman Mr. Balance returned to
Warwickshire, where he told Sir Sidney that, from what he could gather, he
feared the wretched tale was but too true.</P>
<P>It will be remembered that Charles knew, in the south of
France, a father Fitzgibbon, who told him that, in three years from that time,
he should have some business in England, and would then call on him in
London. Our hero gave him a direction to Mr. Balance, who, he knew, would be
his man <PB N="322" REF="322"/> <GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/> 
<PB REF="323"/><GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/> 
<PB N="324" REF="324"/> of business, and who, whether they were friends or
foes, would, of course, forward any thing or person to him.</P>
<P>It will also be recollected that Mrs. Hazard's mo∣nument at
Rochester, from which Mr. Gloss re∣ceived some of his intelligence, was
shewn to all strangers. It appears therefore feasible enough that Father
Fitzgibbon, in his way from Dover to the capital, should have seen it.</P>
<P>Father Fitzgibbon was the person now introduced by Mr.
Balance, who had scarcely exchanged the usual compliments with Charles,
when he admired by what remarkable and extraordinary means the strangest
discoveries are brought about. In short, it appeared that he was the
intimate friend of Com∣brie, and had received the greatest obligations from
his family; that he had known him the whole time he meditated the elopement<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with Miss Le Clerc, and indeed was
the very friend who had equipped him with the dress in which he so
successfully per∣sonated father Benedict. He had also connived at the
business of the keys, and lent him much other material assistance,
which he was the better enabled to do, as he was well acquainted with Goufre's
af∣fairs, and then belonged to a convent at Dieu-le-war, about two leagues from
Nancy, where all intelli∣gent <PB N="325" REF="325"/> travellers to that part of
France have been in∣formed there is such a convent made up of English,
Irish, and Scotch, and where they brew very good beer.</P>
<P>Fitzgibbon mentioned the business of Miss Le Clerc's
journey to England, and of Combrie's pre∣venting her from leaving the papers at
Sir Sidney's; adding, that those papers had at length been entrust∣ed to
him, and that, as he understood they contained something of consequence,
he had deferred 
<Q REND="inline">'send∣ing them by another,' to use his own
words, 'till he had an opportunity of delivering them him∣self.'</Q></P>
<P>So saying, he gave the packet to Sir Sidney, who, in a moment,
knew and proclaimed that the hand writing was that of Annette's mother.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Then I am right, I find,' said
Fitzgibbon.—</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Too right,' cried one.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Fatal confirmation!' sighed another.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Cruel destiny!' said a third.—</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Unheard of misery!' exclaimed a fourth.</Q>
In short, the whole company exhibited such tokens of wretchedness, that
the Irishman cried 
<Q REND="inline">'Why, by my soul, one would tink, by all
these destinies, and fates, and long faces, that I had brought over the
plague sealed up in a letter. Upon my <PB N="326" REF="326"/> honour and
conscience I only discharged the pro∣mise I made poor Mrs. Combrie, four
years ago, who desired me moreover to add that every syllable was
authentic; for in that paper would be found the lady's dying words in her own
hand writ∣ing.'</Q></P>
<P>It occurring in a moment to every one present that if Mrs.
Combrie, four years ago, had given Fitzgibbon the dying words of somebody
else, writ∣ten in a hand which Sir Sidney knew to be that of Annette's
mother, Mrs. Combrie could not be that mother, every countenance immediately
under∣went a total change, and what had been but the moment before certain
misery, was now sweet ex∣pectation. This was immediately evinced by a
volley of opposite exclamations; at which Fitzgibbon exclaimed, 
<Q REND="inline">'Pray good folks is it Bedlam I am in? By my
soul, you seem first to be crazy, and after∣wards distracted.'</Q></P>
<P>By this time Sir Sidney having ran over a part of what the
packet contained, found abundantly enough to convince him that there was no
farther bar to the happiness of his daughter and our hero. To be brief, from
the papers, backed by what Fitz∣gibbon had learnt from Mrs. Combrie, it
appeared that she was certainly the Mamma Le Clerc for∣merly 
<PB N="327" REF="327"/> mentioned; for that Annette's mother had left her infant
daughter to her care, requesting she would contrive to convey her to Sir
Sidney; which commission, through the medium of the nuns of St. Claire, as
we have seen, she faithfully executed.</P>
<P>The sentiments, the distresses, the very names of Mrs.
Combrie and Annette's mother bearing so strong a similarity, it is not at
all extraordinary that there should be this strict friendship between
them, or that this assimilation of circumstances should beget a
likelihood that they were one and the same person. The conduct of the two
fathers also is re∣markably similar, and it would be extraordinary if it
was not. They were both bigotted catholics, and both punished the
disobedience of their daugh∣ters, by shutting them up in a convent; which
is only two instances out of two thousand, or very likely ten thousand,
upon the records of French nunneries, where the same crime has been
punished in the same manner. We have heard that the fa∣ther of Mrs. Combrie
died in England. They now learnt that the father of Annette's mother died in
Italy, after he had given the whole of his fortune to the church.</P>
<P>Fitzgibbon got the laugh completely against the company in the
course of investigating all these mat∣ters. <PB N="328" REF="328"/> He
said that, after all, they were sad bun∣glers at a discovery; for, added
he, 
<Q REND="inline">'though you have only just found it out, by my
faith you knew it well enough long ago:'</Q> and really, if it were not highly
indecent to get the laugh against the reader, I should be tempted to follow
the Irish∣man's example, and indulge myself at his expence; for it
certainly ought to have occurred to him that each of these ladies had a
Christian name, and, if it had, he would have know that the Christian name
of Sir Sidney's Miss Le Clerc was Annette, and that of Combrie's Miss Le
Clerc was Araminta.</P>
<P>This very circumstance of the difference in the Christian
names, accounts for the whole, and shews how much deeper fear impresses
us than hope.—Araminta was the name placed upon the tomb, and had it been
proper to have questioned Gloss as to where he got his intelligence, his
answer must have developed the whole mystery: nay, lest it should be
penetrated by the reader, it may be recollected that I took advantage of the
mistake of Charles, who, absorbed in thought, called Mrs. Hazard An∣nette,
by mistake, as she lay in her coffin.</P>
<P>Thus, I have gradually and naturally unravelled all that mass
of entangled circumstances that stood between our hero and the
possession of his wishes. <PB N="329" REF="329"/> I shall not offer
on my labours a single comment. If they embrace any important purpose, if
they incul∣cate any useful moral, or serve occasionally as ob∣jects of
warning or imitation in the various pursuits of life, I shall have
exercised a pleasing duty, and shall not fail to receive the thanks of
every man of reason and honour as my reward.</P>
<P>As Annette was recently recovered from so se∣vere an
indisposition, and as there were some other very serious matters to
settle, it was agreed that her union with Charles should be deferred till
their ap∣proaching grand feast, which was to be celebrated in about a
month.</P>
<P>I shall take that interval to give a very summary account of
what became of the other characters which I have introduced into this work.</P>
<P>Standfast actually did what Swash pretended to do. He
poisoned himself in his cell, to prevent his trial. The interval between
his commitment to jail and his defrauding the hangman, exhibited a most
frightful example to all villains. It consisted of alternate fits of
intoxication. In some of these he execrated and blasphemed; in others he
trembled with terror at the horrid images his fancy created 
<PB N="330" REF="330"/> to torture him. One hour he howled in an agony of
apprehension, in another raved in a paroxysm of imprecation; till at length
his son Gloss, affectio∣nate and considerate to the last, prevailed on
a com∣mon friend to visit him, who, well tutored for the purpose, induced
him to save the disgrace that would be entailed on his memory by an
ignomini∣ous death, and anticipate his fate by poison.</P>
<P>Gloss himself had the address to turn this cir∣cumstance
to his own account, intimating that they had, among them, made away with his
father, for fear circumstances not altogether so pleasant should come
out on the trial. As to his own fate, it was this. He was put in the pillory,
where he har∣rangued the populace to such good effect, that he persuaded
them the constitution of their country was rotten; that the grossest
abuses were practised by those who were entrusted with the public
con∣cerns; and, so completely did he, for the moment, work upon the people's
credulity, that, when he returned to prison, the horses were taken from the
hackney coach, in which he rode, and the deluded populace, with one consent,
yoked themselves in their place: exactly the same as if they were
ho∣nourably conducting some patriot, who had done an essential service
to his country!</P>
<P><PB N="331" REF="331"/> In process of time he was liberated,
since when he has lived in various circumstances, by depreda∣tions on the
public; and, at this hour, goes about, like the arch fiend, his principal,
seeking whom he may devour.</P>
<P>Mrs. O'Shocknesy, who had robbed Standfast, scarcely
arrived on the continent when she was robbed and deserted by Dogbolt. After
this, she herded with a set of contrabanders; and at length,—first
being detected and branded—she finished her career diseased,
loathsome, and a pauper, in the <HI>Hotel de Dieu.</HI></P>
<P>As to Tadpole and his wife, as they knew that a retrospection
would bring out every particular of their nefarious conduct, they thought it
expedient to meet their examiners half way. Charles found the estate rather
improved than injured by Tadpole's management, and therefore scrupled not to
pay such bonds, and fulfil such other engagements, en∣tered into by his
brother, as did not strike at the <HI>terra firma</HI> of his ancestors. He
also agreed to a handsome provision for the children; one of whom, at
this moment, is the best horse jockey, and the other the best maker of
nut-crackers, in the king∣dom.</P>
<P><PB N="332" REF="332"/> Tadpole, with this money, and what he had
pri∣vately amassed, launched boldly into his own pro∣fession of
attorney, to which he added that of money lender, and has accumulated an
immense fortune, by administering to the necessities of young men of
fashion, under age; not scrupling, occasionally, to lend the person of
his <HI>cara sposa</HI>—on whom he doats to distraction, and who
rules him with a rod of Iron—to bind an advantageous bargain.</P>
<P>The penitent John was put, by Kiddy, into the hands of a
methodist preacher, to complete his con∣version; but, the good man going
the wrong way to work, by terrifying instead of soothing him, his brain was
at length touched, and he finished his life and his misery together, by a
rash leap into Swash's mill-stream.</P>
<P>As to the sinner Kiddy, as he used to call him∣self, he
lived for some time pretty comfortably on a handsome annuity that Charles
had granted him; but having frequented meetings, conferences, and
love-feasts, till his senses were a little deranged, he first slanged
himself, as he called it, behind the door, and, being cut down, the shock
so preyed upon his spirits, that, doubling his visits to the brandy
bottle, he is said literally to have gone out <PB N="333" REF="333"/> of the
world with a dram in one hand and a homily in the other.</P>
<P>At length came the day which was to unite per∣haps the most
elegant and accomplished pair that ever graced the altar of Hymen. The grand
feast was conducted with prodigious splendour, which the reader will the
more readily conceive, when he adds to the former description of this
festival the ad∣ditional exertions upon the present happy occasion.</P>
<P>Every friend within the knowledge of any of the parties was
invited, and, among the rest, Ego, Toogood, and Musquito, who, spight of
their jar∣ring dispositions, united in an universal acknow∣ledgment that
wealth, worth, and happiness were never more emulously blended
together.</P>
<P>A few words more will still be necessary. The good
Mildman, in a very advanced age, yielded his breath amidst the lamentations
of his parishio∣ners, who sincerely mourned his memory, as they accompanied
his remains to their last home, and who—all they had—as their
only remaining tribute to his worth, dropt the tear of sensibility on the
grave of virtue.</P>
<P>Figgins, who married the amiable Jude, suc∣ceeded 
<PB N="334" REF="334"/> Mildman. His reformation is perfect and confirmed, and
his conduct honourable and exem∣plary. Blest with two such friends as Sir
Sidney and Charles, his happiness is complete. His ef∣forts at Castlewick,
in conjunction with those of Mr. Friend, at Little Hockley, who is still
alive, though very old, have rendered those industrious communities the
emulation of each other.</P>
<P>Mrs. Marlow succeeded Emma as companion to Lady Roebuck, Emma
herself having, at the earnest recommendation of the baronet, married the
butler, now Sir Sidney's land steward. She had long be∣fore, as I hinted to
the reader, a sneaking kindness for him, on account of his fidelity to his
master in France. This had improved, to use her own words, into esteem,
from her knowledge of him in the fa∣mily, and had been confirmed into love, by
his re∣fusing to take a part against Sir Sidney in her grand plot, which,
however worthy in her, would, in him, have been treachery. She has several
children, who, instructed by her, are become excellent English scholars,
for she does not chuse they should aspire to any thing more. She is
universally beloved, and will be universally regretted. On a conversation
with Annette, the other day, in which this topic was touched upon, she
said, that as her book of life now verged towards the last page, it gave
her great <PB N="335" REF="335"/> satisfaction to reflect that she should
not fear to look at the word Finis, having inculcated, in every line, that
goodness is the best security for happiness.— 
<Q REND="inline">'The hour of death,' added Emma, for she is
now grown rather sententious, 'is the hell of the wick∣ed, the purgatory of
the doubtful, and the heaven of the virtuous.'</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Balance is still alive, and as much respected as ever.
Sir Sidney, who is Mr. Balance's senior by a year, being now seventy-five,
is also living in all the vigour of health and strength. He can still
play at cricket and quoits, and pitch the bar as well as ever; and it was but
the other day he was re∣quested to let his name stand in a tontine,
instead of that of a fashionable young man of twenty. The ve∣nerable and
amiable Lady Roebuck is also living.—Her employment is the care of our
hero's children: out of seven, three of whom are alive: two boys and a girl.
The baronet has long since given over his idea of augmenting his grandeur as
to himself, but having recently 
<Q REND="inline">'done the state some service,'</Q> he is
promised a peerage in favour of Charles's second son, by the name and
title of Sidney Roebuck, Earl of Castlewick.</P>
<P>As to Charles and Annette, little more need be said. Complete
in beauty, goodness, clegance, and <PB N="336" REF="336"/> virtue, no wonder
they are completely happy. Nor is the goodness and virtue of this amiable
commu∣nity of friends selfishly consined. It transfuses its conscious
blessings to all around. Charles's dar∣ling passion for patronizing
worth and merit, aided by Sir Sidney, flows now in its right channel. All are
sure of encouragement who worthily apply for it, nor is there an individual
in either Castlewick or Little Hockley that does not feel, and enjoy the
gene∣rous influence of their wide-extended philanthropy.</P>
<P>These fortunate places are now equally reasonable and
equally happy. Both know the advantages re∣sulting from mild control and
honourable obedience. In short, they are a type of the country at
large.—Every individual is thankful to the power that se∣cures his
safety, protects his property, and succours his family; and there is not
one among them, sti∣mulated by these principles, and encouraged by their
patrons, that would not nobly risk his life, were it necessary, in
defence of the wisest of constitutions, and the best of kings.</P>
