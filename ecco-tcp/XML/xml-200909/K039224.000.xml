<STAGE><HI>Spoke by Mr.</HI> WRIGHT.</STAGE>
<SP>
<LG>
<L>IN short — good Folk — a dismal Truth to tell</L>
<L>I come to toll our Author's passing Bell.</L>
<L>His Farce won't do — the Reason, wou'd you know it?</L>
<L>(For sure the Spark has something of the Poet)</L>
<L>The Muse cries out, such sad Examples taught her,</L>
<L>No Bard can thrive — unless he cross the Water.</L>
<L>Severe Decree! — no homeborn Muse delights,</L>
<L>Nothing shall please — but what a Stranger writes!</L>
<L>Let us exert ourselves — assume a Spirit,</L>
<L>And think our Title — good as theirs — to Merit.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What Heaven lov'd Clime — but our thrice happy Coast</L>
<L>Of such successful Patriots can boast,</L>
<L>With one collected Force the Arts to nourish,</L>
<L>Make Trade survive, and sacred Culture flourish;</L>
<L>And yet — to future Times 'twill seem surprizing,</L>
<L>While each deserving Artist's sure of rising;</L>
<L>While a Mechanick Merit's well rewarded,</L>
<L>The tatter'd Muse repines — not once regarded.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To this August Assembly we submit;</L>
<L>To you — we recommend the Cause of Wit:</L>
<L>Arise — nor see a native Genius braved,</L>
<L>Too long have such been <HI>banish'd</HI> — or enslaved;</L>
<L>And tho' our Author makes a weak Endeavour,</L>
<L>He'll Mend upon the Sun-shine of your Favour.</L>

<SPEAKER>JERRY.</SPEAKER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">O</SEG>N my Soul, Sir, I can't but Ad∣mire this extreme Vivacity of your Inclinations: Scarce six Days since you were dying for a Baby-fac'd Thing at <HI>Oxford,</HI> and scarce six Hours in <HI>London,</HI> till you are over-head and Ears in Love with a —</P>

<SP>
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>S'Death, <HI>Jerry,</HI> I'm all on Fire — well — the dear Minute of Appointment is just at hand; this Letter in Answer to the One you deliver'd her, informs me, that she's kept by an old Jealous Knight in the City — she's a fine Woman by Heaven — and if it be in the Power of her Sex to drive that intollerable Coquet <HI>Charlott</HI> out of my Head, I think 'tis she can do it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jer.</SPEAKER>
<P>Heaven send there comes a good End on't — well, if I shou'd have my Bones shat∣ter'd in this Rencounter, 'twill not be the first Time I have been paid for my Inge∣nuity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Peace, Scoundrel, and learn to bear Misfortunes with a Pimplike Patience.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jer.</SPEAKER>
<P>Patience! yes you may talk of Pa∣tience truly, while all the Pleasure of the Sin belongs to yourself, and all the Punishment to your humble Servant — how oft have these unfortunate Bones of mine been beaten to a Jelly in your Service!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Sirrah, if your Ill-Stars con∣demn you to Disappointments, can I prevent them? If ever you suffer'd in your Vocation, some unfortunate Blunder of your own oc∣casion'd it; you remember the Letter you gave to <HI>Charlott</HI>'s Jealous Guardian? When
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>in the overflowing of your Wisdom you mistook him for her Footman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jer.</SPEAKER>
<P>Remember it! I do, by all that's un∣fortunate: confound the old Dog — he laid on me like an <HI>Hercules.</HI> He had put on her Footman's Livery on purpose to lay wait for me; yet all this I cou'd have borne with the Patience of an Alderman, but the insup∣portable Weight of your Honour's Oaken Cudgel!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Resentment was reasonable, Sir∣rah, such a preposterous Mistake! but tell me <HI>Jerry,</HI> don't you think <HI>Charlott</HI> will be confoundedly piqu'd at my so sudden De∣parture fron <HI>Oxford,</HI> without sending her one single Line, or whining out the least tender Adieu at Parting?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jer.</SPEAKER>
<P>Piqu'd, Sir! Lord, Sir, I thought you understood the inside of a Coquet better, tho' it might puzzle one of a longer standing at <HI>Oxford,</HI> to tell what to make of her — why, Sir, a Coquet is always so well pleas'd with herself that nothing in Nature is capable of discomposing her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet, <HI>Jerry,</HI> tho' she used me with such a studied ill Nature, I sometimes thought she did not hate me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jer.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hate you! no, no, Sir, in my humble
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>Opinion she was extremely well pleas'd with you; at least she has Reason to be very well pleas'd with herself since she had it in her Power to make so fine a Gentleman a down∣right —.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, out with it Sirrah, I shan't be angry.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jer.</SPEAKER>
<P>A downright Ass — begging your Honour's Pardon.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, really Sir, you do make something Free with me, but will your Worship be pleas'd to explain what you mean by honouring me with that extraordi∣nary Title?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jer.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, Sir, I beg you won't take it ill that I said so, for on my Honour, Sir, I assure you I have seen Persons of great Rank and Distinction act over all the pretty Follies of that sagacious Animal, and value them∣selves extremely upon it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray then, most Philosophical Sir, will you please to inform me, what one Action of mine happens to fall under the Lash of your Satire?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jer.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, really Sir, as you have been so long notorious in the Class of Lovers, I think your Question is easily resolv'd: Lovers since the Creation have been generally esteem'd
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>little better than—but since the Title of the fore-mention'd Animal seems to affect you so nearly, I'll forbear repeating it, and leave it to yourself to consider, what are the Mo∣tives which hurried you so suddenly to <HI>Lon∣don,</HI> with scarce a single Guinea in your Pocket, unknown to your Father, or Friends, and I may even venture to say almost un∣known to yourself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why <HI>Jerry,</HI> I think my coming to <HI>London</HI> a Masterpiece of Resolution, and I applaud myself for it extremely. I doated even to Folly on that <HI>Charlott,</HI> the greatest Tyrant of her Sex. You are sensible how she used me — in short I was become ridicu∣lous even to myself, and judging with a great deal of Justice that in dear <HI>London</HI> alone I might hope to recover my Reason, I resolv'd to break my Chains at once, and let the Coquet see that Beauty without Merit had lost all Power to make a Fool of me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jer.</SPEAKER>
<P>So we take Horse in a Pet, Whip, Spur, and away; leave being silly at <HI>Oxford</HI> to come and play the downright Fool at <HI>London;</HI> for Curse me, Sir, still begging your Honour's Pardon, if I can at present see that your Intentions are conducted with the least Appearance of common Sense.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Since I must explain my Intentions, Sir, to make a Man of your vast Judgment approve them, you must know that by a Va∣riety of Pleasures here in <HI>London,</HI> I design to lose even the Remembrance of my <HI>Oxford</HI> Mistress; and least the Presence of an old peevish Father might Interrupt those Pleasures, I am positively resolv'd to avoid all Places where 'twere probable I might meet with him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jer.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so, Sir, you begin this fine Va∣riety of Pleasures by an Intrigue with Mistress what's her Name here, this fine kept Mistress — and that too with a Pair of Pockets Damnably badly lin'd — a likely Prospect of succeeding, truly!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you exert yourself <HI>Jerry,</HI> our Plot upon my Father can't miscarry; then, if she be a mercenary Whore? Damn Money, 'twas made to purchase Pleasure—'tis now just Six.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Locks at his Watch.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jer.</SPEAKER>
<P>And pray, Sir, what is to be your humble Servant's Duty while you amuse your∣self with the Lady? You'll please to give Or∣ders that the Waiting-Maid may entertain me I hope.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have Business enough upon you Hands, Sirrah; now you see me lodg'd, find out my Father, and if Fortune smiles
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>on you, you'll find me here, ready to receive her Favours.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Going out,</HI> Charlott <HI>enters in Boys Cloaths, and jostles him.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Char.</SPEAKER>
<P>Zouns, Sir, en't the Street wide e∣nough? or did you design to affront me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have other Business in hand, Sir, than either to affront you, or stay to make an Apology.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Char.</SPEAKER>
<P>Business? what Business can he have, into that House too? Oh, here's his Hang∣dog, of a Man, his Pimp and Prime Minister; 'tis certainly some Intrigue has brought him there: If I don't mistake that down-look, that Fellow is a Pimp and a Coward, so may I either Bully or Bribe him out of his Master's Secrets. Harkee me, you Sir, Prythee what Business have you lurking about this House here?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jer.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lurking about, Sir! I'd have you to know I'm a Man of Honour, Sir, and not used to answer such Questions — Lurking about! Tum, tum, tum, I walk here, Sir, for the Recreation of my Legs, and the Pro∣creation of my Appetite.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Char.</SPEAKER>
<P>I mistake Friend, or your walking here tends to the Procreation of something
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>else — come, Sir, no equivocating, answer me directly, upon what Design are you sta∣tioned at this Corner, and what Business your commanding Officer has in yonder Citadel?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jer.</SPEAKER>
<P>Who the Devil have we here? some young Don <HI>Quixote</HI> enamour'd with the fair and virtuous Lady of the Castle, I'll warrant you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Char.</SPEAKER>
<P>Zouns, Sir, no trifling, confess, or by this Sword I'll pin you to the Wall: come, there's a Lady in the Case?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jer.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why truly Sir, as you say, there is a Lady in the Case, a Woman of great Ho∣nour and Reputation, I assure you; and my Master whom you saw just now enter, is a very honourable Man, and by this Time I suppose them engag'd in a very honourable Affair. Now, Sir, I have satisfy'd your Cu∣riosity, you'll please to withdraw and leave me to my Meditations.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Char.</SPEAKER>
<P>So, you are to defend the out Works, while the General beats up the Quarters within.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jer.</SPEAKER>
<P>A Man of shrew'd Penetration truly!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Char.</SPEAKER>
<P>A few Words more with you, good Mr. Pimp, and we shall come to a Conclu∣sion. In short who is this Lady? her Name? her Fortune? is she Young, Handsome, a Maid, or marry'd, is she —</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="13" REF="12"/>
<SPEAKER>Jer.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hold: hold, Sir, not so fast, I've a devilish short Memory, and shall never be able to answer so many Questions in Order — it must be the Devil himself, or a Lawyer, for he wou'd fain puzzle me with cross Questions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Char.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dammee, Scoundrel, speak at once to the Purpose or—here's the most perswasive little Blade in Christendom.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jer.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis strange now, Sir, what a won∣derful Antipathy, I've ever had even to the Sight of Cold Iron; 'tis a treacherous Sort of a Crocodile Companion, that's the Truth on't, while it smiles in a Man's Face, whip it has him through the Lungs in a twinkling.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Char.</SPEAKER>
<P>S'Death—do you Play on me Rascal?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jer.</SPEAKER>
<P>Play on you! ah Lord, Sir, you mistake me intirely, Play on you! no, no, Sir, but 'tis my way, Sir, to moralize a little on every Subject that offers: You must know, Sir, I have had Part of my Education at <HI>Oxford,</HI> that Seat of the Muses! That Theatre of Learning! That Fountain of Eru∣dition! now, Sir, in my Opinion as I have an undoubted Right to make Use of the great Share of Knowledge and Wisdom I therein acquir'd, I shou'd think it quite opposite to
<PB N="14" REF="13"/>Prudence and common Sense to trifle any longer with so worthy a little Gentleman, so by your Leave, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Comes nearer and nearer, till he wrests the Sword from her.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Char.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Devil! the Villain has almost broke my Arm.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jer.</SPEAKER>
<P>And now, Sir, will you please to let me know what Business you have lurking about this House here?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Char.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, come, <HI>Jeremy,</HI> you'll find I know you and your Master too; be assur'd my Care for his Safety is my chief Motive for enquiring after him; perhaps there may be Danger in his venturing into yonder House. Come, <HI>Jerry,</HI> depend upon my Honour, I'll not betray you; let this persuade you of my Sincerity. There's a Wench in Chace — Ha! what says my little Mercury?</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Gives him Money.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jer.</SPEAKER>
<P>Arguments drawn from the Mint are certainly the most prevailing in Logick, an excellent Sentence by all that's Eloquent—Sir you have rivetted <HI>Jeremy Ply,</HI> Gentleman, eter∣nally to your Service; and tho' I have not the Honour of knowing you, I'm so well convinc'd of your Friendship for me and my Master,
<PB N="15" REF="14"/>that without more Preamble, I plead Guilty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Char.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is she a Woman of Fortune, or Fa∣mily? a Widow perhaps, or —</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jer.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, Sir, neither Maid, Wife, nor Widow, I'll assure you, but a true Daughter of the Game: A kept Mistress, Sir, and as free of her Favours as any young Rake of ye all cou'd wish for.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Char.</SPEAKER>
<P>So much the better, <HI>Jerry,</HI> for I can't possibly resist the Temptation of paying my Respects to her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jer.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh Lord, Sir, by no means, Sir; my Master will certainly murder me: Con∣sider, Sir, he fix'd me here on purpose to hinder every thing in Breeches from disturb∣ing him, besides, Sir, your Honour, your Honour is pledg'd.</P>

<P>In short, Sir, he has kill'd his Man, fairly kill'd him, a Dispute happened, a Challenge was sent, the Gentlemen met, and it was my young Master's very good Fortune, Sir, to pink the very Soul of his Antagonist: for to besure, Sir, Mr. <HI>Robert,</HI> as he has the Honour of being your Son, must be a Man of Courage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Courage! what the Devil had he to do with Courage? A fine talk about Cou∣rage, truly: so good <HI>Robert Willmore,</HI><ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Son of Sir <HI>William Willmore</HI> of <HI>Willmore Hall,</HI> in <HI>Comitatu Bucks,</HI> must be hang'd forsooth,
<PB N="18" REF="19"/>because he is a Man of Courage!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jer.</SPEAKER>
<P>His Duty, Sir, and this Letter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hum, Hum — <HI>According to the Principles of Honour, Sir, I could not avoid calling an Insolent young Officer to a close Ac∣count for publickly affronting me: It was his Misfortune to fall by my Sword,</HI> (fine Princi∣ples of Honour truly) <HI>I am now under an Arrest; yet, if any Thing hinders the Affair being immediately made up, 'tis a Deficiency of ready Money,</HI> (so) <HI>which I'm positive you'll pre∣vent with your accustomed Indulgence.</HI></P>
<P>A mighty pretty Request! a very reasonable Demand truly! Hearkee, my good Mr. Squire, you'll let your Man of Courage know from me, that I don't at all approve of his Principles of Honour; and that I'm resolv'd not to part with a single Farthing, and if he has no other Way to Escape, but by the help of my broad Pieces, he may e'en say his Prayers, and prepare for another World, for I'll not part with a Souse, tell him so, and so farewell, good Mr. Man of Courage!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jer.</SPEAKER>
<P>For Heaven's Sake, Sir, consider, the poor young Gentleman will break his Heart, if you treat him with so much Inhumanity.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Break his Heart, Sir, Ouns, let him; better he shou'd break his Heart, than
<PB N="19" REF="20"/>be hang'd: Courage, quotha: so if he thinks fit to Kill half the Town in his Courage, I have Nothing to do but open my Bags and scatter my old Gold to save him from the Gallows, a good Jest! a very good Jest! by the Lord <HI>Harry.</HI></P>

<P>Besides, Sir, as his Annuity becomes due you may repay yourself, what you are pleased to advance upon this Occasion, you were always indulgent, Sir, consider he is young —</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>He's young, and I'm old, Sir, he's a Fool and I'm a wise Man, Sir, he's a Man of Courage, and I'm a Man that must pay for it, it seems; here Scoundrel, here are two Ten Pound Bags, ready seal'd, and yet I've a wonderful Temptation to let the young Rascal Hang for it: here are twenty Pieces, Sirrah, and let me hear that he makes a proper Use of them, and not one Word more of his Courage—or—</P>

<P>Oh Lord, Sir, not a Tittle, we shall take a quite different Method, Sir, when those are expired. And so Sir, with all Sub∣mission, and Respect, I return to my Master, who'll be overjoy'd at the agreeable News of your good Health and the Success of his Cou∣rage, and my Parts.</P>
