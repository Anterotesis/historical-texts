<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<SP>
<STAGE>Spoken by Mr. ROSS.</STAGE>
<LG>
<L>PROLOGUES of old, the Learn'd in Language say,</L>
<L>Were merely Introductions to the Play,</L>
<L>Spoken by Gods, or Ghosts, or Men who knew</L>
<L>Whate'er was previous to the Scenes in view;</L>
<L>And complaisantly came to lay before ye</L>
<L>The several Heads, and Windings of the Story.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But modern Times and <HI>British</HI> Rules are such,</L>
<L>Our Bards beforehand must not tell too much;</L>
<L>Nor dare we, like the neighb'ring <HI>French,</HI> admit</L>
<L>Ev'n Confidantes, who might instruct the Pit,</L>
<L>By asking Questions of the leading Few,</L>
<L>And hearing Secrets, which before they knew.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet what we can to help this antique Piece</L>
<L>We will attempt.—Our Scene to-night is <HI>Greece.</HI></L>
<L>And, by the Magic of the Poet's Rod,</L>
<L>This Stage the Temple of the <HI>Delphic</HI> God!</L>
<L>Where Kings, and Chiefs, and Sages came of old,</L>
<L>Like modern Fools, to have their Fortunes told;</L>
<L>And Monarchs were enthron'd, or Nations freed,</L>
<L>As an old Priest, or wither'd Maid decreed.</L>
<L>Yet think not all were equally deceiv'd,</L>
<L>Some knew, more doubted, many more believ'd.</L>
<L>In short, these Oracles, and witching Rhimes</L>
<L>Were but the pious Frauds of ancient Times;</L>
<L>Wisely contriv'd to keep Mankind in awe,</L>
<L>When Faith was Wonder, and Religion Law!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus much premis'd, to every feeling Breast</L>
<L>We leave the Scenes themselves to tell the rest.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>—Yet something sure was to the Critics said,</L>
<L>Which I forget,—some Invocation made!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ye Critic Bands, like jealous Guardians, plac'd</L>
<L>To watch th' Encroachments on the Realms of Taste,</L>
<L>From you our Author would two Boons obtain,</L>
<L>Not wholly diffident, nor wholly vain:</L>
<L>Two things he asks; 'tis modest sure, from you</L>
<L>Who can do all things, to request but two:</L>
<L>First to his Scenes a kind Attention pay,</L>
<L>Then judge!—with Candor judge—and we obey.</L>

<L>The good King</L>
<L>Of whom you spake, <HI>Erectheus,</HI> did his People</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>PHORBAS.</SPEAKER>
<L>He was my good old Master, such a King</L>
<L>As Heaven but rarely sends. Did we esteem</L>
<L>And love him, dost thou ask? O, we ador'd him,</L>
<L>He was our Father, not our King.—These Tears</L>
<L>At least may speak <HI>my</HI> Heart.—We must not hope</L>
<L>In these degenerate Times to see him equall'd.</L>
<L>He never did an unkind Act, but once,</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>PHORBAS.</SPEAKER>
<L>O Maid, 'twere long to tell</L>
<L>The whole unhappy Story, yet in part</L>
<L>Hear what to me appears too closely join'd</L>
<L>With these our present Ills. There was a Youth</L>
<L><HI>Athenian</HI> born, but not of Royal Blood,</L>
<L>His Name <HI>Nicander;</HI> him unlucky Fate</L>
<L>Had made the Lover of our present Queen</L>
<L>While yet a Maid. What will not Love attempt</L>
<L>In young ambitious Minds? he told his Pain,</L>
<L>And won the Fair in secret to admit,</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="10"/>And to return his Passion. The good King</L>
<L>Was for a Time deceiv'd, but found at last</L>
<L>Th' audacious Fraud, and drove the guilty Youth</L>
<L>To Banishment perpetual. Some say</L>
<L>'Twas by his Means he fell, tho' that my Heart</L>
<L>Consents not to believe. Thus much is sure,</L>
<L><HI>Nicander</HI> wander'd forth a wretched Exile,</L>
<L>And ere few Days had past, upon the Road</L>
<L>Were found his well-known Garments stain'd with Blood.</L>
<L>Sure Sign of Murder, and as sure a Sign</L>
<L>No needy Robber was the Instrument.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PYTHIA.</SPEAKER>
<L>How bore <HI>Creusa</HI> this?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PHORBAS.</SPEAKER>
<L>At first her Sorrows</L>
<L>Were loud and frantic. Time at length subdued</L>
<L>Her Rage to silent Grief. The good old King,</L>
<L>To sooth her Woes, consented she should raise</L>
<L>A Tomb to her <HI>Nicander;</HI> and perform</L>
<L>A Kind of annual Rites to parted Love.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PYTHIA.</SPEAKER>
<L>But that not long continued, for we find</L>
<L>She married <HI>Xuthus.</HI></L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PHORBAS.</SPEAKER>
<L>'Twas a Match of State,</L>
<L>He sav'd her Country, and she gave her Hand</L>
<L>Because that Country ask'd it. But her Heart</L>
<L>Is buried with <HI>Nicander.</HI> Still to him,</L>
<L>And <HI>Xuthus'</HI> self permits it, she performs</L>
<L>Her yearly Oft'rings, and adorns with Flowers</L>
<L>An empty Tomb.—Would he had liv'd, and reign'd</L>
<L>Her wedded Lord! we had not wanted then</L>
<L>Th' Assistance of a Stranger Arm to guard</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="11"/>Th' <HI>Athenian</HI> State, nor had we then been driven</L>
<L>To search for Heirs at <HI>Delphi.</HI></L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PYTHIA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Stop thy Tongue,</L>
<L>Or speak with Rev'rence of the sacred Shrine.</L>
<L>—Thy Words were hasty, but thy Silence now</L>
<L>Makes just Atonement for them.—Then perhaps</L>
<L>Thou think'st this want of Heirs a Curse entail'd</L>
<L>By Heaven on <HI>Athens</HI> for <HI>Nicander</HI>'s Death</L>
<L>And <HI>Xuthus'</HI> Reign?</L>
</SP>
<SP>

<L>Something mysterious lurks beneath her Tears;</L>

<L>This unknown Youth alone has fill'd her Thoughts,</L>

<L>WHY should I doubt? it will, it must succeed.</L>
<L>Yet I could wish that I had seen <HI>Creusa</HI></L>
<L>Before 'twas undertaken, for perhaps—</L>
<L>'Tis better as it is. Her Part had then</L>
<L>Been difficult to act; now what she does,</L>
<L>Assisting or opposing the Design,</L>
<L>Will all seem natural.—The <HI>Pythia</HI> sure</L>
<L>Will act as I directed.—Hark, the Rites</L>
<L>Should be ere this perform'd; why stay they then?</L>
<L>—That Noise proclaims them finish'd, and the Croud</L>
<L>Will soon be here.—They come, I must not yet</L>
<L>Be seen; the <HI>Pythia</HI> in the Laurel Grove</L>
<L>May tell me what has pass'd.</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>LYCEA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Stay, mighty Queen,</L>
<L>You know not what you do; your Rage transports you;</L>
<L>You leave the Rites unfinish'd, and the Croud</L>
<L>In wild Amazement gaze on your Departure.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CREUSA.</SPEAKER>
<L>I will not stay, nor will I tamely bear</L>
<L><PB N="37" REF="44"/>My disappointed Hopes. O honest <HI>Phorbas,</HI></L>
<L>O good old Man, thy penetrating Mind</L>
<L>Saw early their Designs. 'Tis to supply</L>
<L><HI>Nicander</HI>'s Loss (O ne'er to be supply'd!)</L>
<L>That we must call in Strangers to the Throne,</L>
<L>And yield our Scepters to <HI>Aeolian</HI> Hands.</L>
<L>—Yes, ye great Shades of my Progenitors,</L>
<L>I hear ye call, ye shall, ye shall have Vengeance!</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LYCEA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Whatever you design, conceal at least</L>
<L>This Transport of your Rage.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CREUSA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Why loiters <HI>Phorbas?</HI></L>
<L>He saw my Anguish, wherefore comes he not</L>
<L>To its Relief? They fool me past Endurance.</L>
<L>Rely they on the Weakness of my Sex?</L>
<L><HI>Lycea,</HI> they shall find this feeble Arm</L>
<L>In such a Cause can lay the Distaff by,</L>
<L>And grasp th' unerring Thunderbolt of <HI>Jove.</HI></L>
<L>O <HI>Phorbas,</HI> art thou come?</L>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> PHORBAS <HI>from the Temple.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PHORBAS.</SPEAKER>
<L>Now, mighty Queen,</L>
<L>Are my Suspicions just? is <HI>Phorbas</HI> honest?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CREUSA.</SPEAKER>
<L>As Light, as Truth itself. My Counsellor,</L>
<L>My Bosom Friend!</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PHORBAS.</SPEAKER>
<L>Now shall a casual Likeness,</L>
<L>If such there be, a semblant Cast of Features,</L>
<L>The Sport of Nature in a human Form,</L>
<L>Shall Trisles light as these weigh down Conviction?</L>
<L>O Queen, from first to last th' apparent Scheme</L>
<L><PB N="38" REF="45"/>Glares on us now. Why were we brought to <HI>Delphi,</HI></L>
<L>But that this Youth has long been nurtur'd here</L>
<L>In secret from the World; perhaps the Son</L>
<L>Of <HI>Xuthus'</HI> self, plac'd here at first to hide</L>
<L>The Guilt and Shame of some dishonest Mother,</L>
<L>Tho' now applied to more pernicious Ends.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CREUSA.</SPEAKER>
<L>It may be so.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PHORBAS.</SPEAKER>
<L>And why, say why, to-day,</L>
<L>While <HI>Xuthus</HI> stays behind for Oracles</L>
<L>He wanted not, is young <HI>Ilyssus</HI> bid</L>
<L>To meet your Eyes, and win with artful Tales</L>
<L>Your easy Heart?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CREUSA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Bid! was he bid to do it?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PHORBAS.</SPEAKER>
<L>I saw the Priestess whisper something to him,</L>
<L>Then loud she bade him wait for thy Approach.</L>
<L>She must, forsooth, retire to sacred Glooms,</L>
<L>And wait for Inspiration. <HI>Xuthus'</HI> Gold</L>
<L>Was what inspir'd the Traitress. Yet, good Heaven,</L>
<L>When from the Shrine she gave the fraudful Words,</L>
<L>With what strange Art the holy Hypocrite</L>
<L>In mimic Trances died!—"A banish'd Youth</L>
<L>"Is <HI>Athens'</HI> Cause of Woe." Too truly said,</L>
<L>Tho' for a wicked Purpose, to allure</L>
<L>Thy easy Faith, and lead thee to admit</L>
<L>The Fraud which follow'd.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CREUSA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Never, never, <HI>Phorbas,</HI></L>
<L>Will I that Fraud admit. How readily</L>
<L>Did <HI>Xuthus,</HI> when my foolish Fondness ask'd it,</L>
<L><PB N="39" REF="46"/>Consent to my Request!<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>To</HI> Lycoa.</NOTE> Thou heard'st him say</L>
<L>We should adopt this Youth; in seeming Sport</L>
<L>He spake it, but ev'n then th' insulting Tyrant</L>
<L>Couch'd fatal Truths beneath th' ambiguous Phrase.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PHORBAS.</SPEAKER>
<L>Why should a Youth design'd for Solitude</L>
<L>Be taught the Arts of War? He saw himself</L>
<L>The Impropriety. Who is this Sage</L>
<L>That has instructed him? And why should <HI>Lycon</HI></L>
<L>O'erflow with sudden Joy, but that he found,</L>
<L>From thy apparent Fondness for the Boy,</L>
<L>Their Schemes grew practicable. Nay, to-day,</L>
<L>When to the Priestess' self my honest Love</L>
<L>For <HI>Athens,</HI> and Dislike of Stranger Kings,</L>
<L>Burst freely forth, she chid my hasty Zeal,</L>
<L>Commended <HI>Xuthus,</HI> talk'd of Piety</L>
<L>And Rev'rence to the Gods: 'Twas to their Priests</L>
<L>She meant, their meddling Priests, who dare presume</L>
<L>To sport with Thrones, to sell their Gods for Gold,</L>
<L>And stamp rank Falshoods with the Seal of Heaven.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LYCEA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Forbear, you are too loud so near the Temple;</L>
<L><HI>Xuthus</HI> himself will hear.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CREUSA.</SPEAKER>
<L>We would be heard.</L>
<L>Instruct me, <HI>Phorbas,</HI> by what means to crush</L>
<L>This impious Combination.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PHORBAS.</SPEAKER>
<L><HI>Athens</HI> yet</L>
<L>Has honest Hearts. Yes, <HI>Phorbas</HI> yet has Friends</L>
<L>Who dare be Patriots, and prefer their Country</L>
<L>To <HI>Xuthus'</HI> kindest Smile. Some such are here</L>
<L>Ev'n now at <HI>Delphi.</HI> But, illustrious Queen,</L>
<L><PB N="40" REF="47"/>We must with Caution act. The Name of Heaven,</L>
<L>Howe'er usurp'd, adds Vigour to their Cause,</L>
<L>And weakens ours. We might in secret find</L>
<L>A sure Revenge.</L>
</SP>

<L>What?</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>PHORBAS.</SPEAKER>
<L>His</L>
<L>Might follow, but the more immediate Cause</L>
<L>Should earliest be remov'd, the Boy.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CREUSA.</SPEAKER>
<L>The Boy!</L>
<L>Why should he die? Believe me, honest <HI>Phorbas,</HI></L>
<L>He knows not of the Fraud. His every Look</L>
<L>Proclaims his Innocence. If impious Men</L>
<L>Make him their Instrument of evil Deeds,</L>
<L>Can he be blam'd? Bred up in Shades, poor Youth,</L>
<L>He never knew the Arts of base Mankind,</L>
<L>Nor should he share their Punishment.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PHORBAS.</SPEAKER>
<L>O Queen,</L>
<L>They have too well succeeded. This fond Passion,</L>
<L>Which their insidious Cunning first inspir'd,</L>
<L>Clings close about your Heart, and may at last</L>
<L>Undo us all.—But hark, that Noise declares</L>
<L>The finish'd Rites. Retire we to the Grove,</L>
<L>And there will I enforce—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CREUSA.</SPEAKER>
<L>No, let us stay.</L>
<L><PB N="41" REF="48"/>I will confront this artful Politician,</L>
<L>And shew him I am yet a Queen.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PHORBAS.</SPEAKER>
<L>Perhaps</L>
<L>'Twere better to retire till our full Scheme</L>
<L>Were ripe for Vengeance.—
<STAGE>* <HI>Aside.</HI></STAGE> Yet if we remain,</L>
<L>High Words must rise, which will alarm her Pride</L>
<L>And fit her for my Purpose.</L>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> XUTHUS, ILYSSUS, <HI>Priests, Virgins, Guards,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>from the Temple.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<STAGE>XUTHUS, (<HI>coming up to</HI> Creusa)</STAGE>
<L>Thy Looks, <HI>Creusa,</HI> thy abrupt Departure</L>
<L>Affronting to the God himself, and these</L>
<L>His sacred Ministers, too plainly shew</L>
<L>Irreverent Rage, resisting Heaven's high Will.</L>
<L>Nor do'st thou want I see, unthinking Woman,</L>
<L>Inflamers of thy Folly.—But of this</L>
<L>Enough; behold the Youth whom Heaven designs</L>
<L>Thy Heir, and mine.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CREUSA.</SPEAKER>
<L>My Heir!</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>XUTHUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>Thy Heir, <HI>Creusa.</HI></L>
<L>What means that haughty Look? Why with Contempt</L>
<L>Do'st thou behold him? Is he chang'd, <HI>Creusa?</HI></L>
<L>Have a few Hours so totally transform'd him?</L>
<L>Is all that winning Grace of which thou spak'st</L>
<L>Almost with Rapture, is that native Charm</L>
<L>Of Innocence all vanish'd? Hear him speak,</L>
<L>Hear if he talks less sensibly than when</L>
<L>Thy pleas'd Attention hung upon his Words,</L>
<L>And lent each Syllable an added Grace.</L>
<L>What hast thou found, or thy grave Monitor</L>
<L><PB N="42" REF="49"/>What has he found, which can so suddenly</L>
<L>Have wrought this wond'rous Change? Is it because</L>
<L>The Gods have thought with thee that he deserves</L>
<L>A Crown? or is it that my Will consents?</L>
<L>And therefore thine, proud Queen, perversely strives</L>
<L>To combat thy Affections?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CREUSA.</SPEAKER>
<L>We methinks</L>
<L>Have chang'd Affections. The calm, steady <HI>Xuthus,</HI></L>
<L>Whose equal Mind ne'er knew the stormy Gusts</L>
<L>Of discomposing Passion, now can feel</L>
<L>Indecent Warmth when touch'd by pious Zeal.</L>
<L>Nay he, to whom the tend'rer Sentiments</L>
<L>Seem'd but the Weakness of the human Frame,</L>
<L>Now wakes inspir'd with some unusual Softness.</L>
<L>Have Oracles the Power to raise at once</L>
<L>The kind Affections? or did he conceal</L>
<L>The smother'd Flame, 'till authoris'd by Heaven</L>
<L>It might burst out unquestion'd?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>XUTHUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>Haughty Queen,</L>
<L>I understand thee well; thou think'st this Youth</L>
<L>A Substitute of mine, and dar'st affront</L>
<L>Yon awful Shrine, the Fountain of pure Truth.</L>
<L>But by that God who bears the vengeful Bow,</L>
<L>And whose large Eye—Yet wherefore should I strive</L>
<L>By Oaths to undeceive thee; Breasts like mine</L>
<L>Can scorn th' imputed Falshood they detest.</L>
<L>Nor am I now to learn from what vile Source</L>
<L>Thy vain Suspicions rise. But know, proud Queen,</L>
<L>This Youth shall reign in <HI>Athens;</HI> and yet more</L>
<L>To punish thy vain Pride, since thou provok'st it,</L>
<L>I do believe him of <HI>Aeolian</HI> Race.</L>

<L>THIS Way, my Friends; at the Pavilion Doors</L>
<L>Stand ready arm'd, that if we need your Aid</L>
<L>You may observe the Sign, and crush at once</L>
<L>These vile Usurpers on the Rights of <HI>Athens.</HI></L>
<L>I hope we want ye not.—I must be hid</L>
<L>A while, lest <HI>Xuthus</HI> should suspect my Presence.</L>
<L>The Queen too may repent, I'll therefore shun her <HI>Aside.</HI></L>

<L>This Quarrel was unlucky. A slight Breach</L>
<L>Had lent my Purpose Strength; but wrought thus high</L>
<L>It may defeat our Hopes. She cannot now</L>
<L>With Ease recede from her too rash Resolves,</L>
<L>At least not unsuspected. Did she, say'st thou,</L>
<L>Reject thy Message?</L>

<SPEAKER>PYTHIA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Scarcely did she pay</L>
<L>The decent Dues my sacred Office claims.</L>

<L>She silently withdrew.</L>

<L>I will pursue her thither.</L>

<SPEAKER>PYTHIA.</SPEAKER>
<L>It may not be, for now I know thy Secret</L>
<L>'Tis my turn to be prudent, Know'st thou not</L>
<L>Thou should'st be cautious, nor expose thyself</L>
<L>To prying Eyes? I heard her, as she pass'd,</L>
<L>In broken Whispers bid <HI>Lycea</HI> haste</L>
<L>To <HI>Phorbas,</HI> and inform that trusty Friend</L>
<L>That she would wait him in the Laurel Grove.</L>
<L>Here then thou may'st surprise them both, and crown</L>
<L>At once thy whole Design.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ALETES.</SPEAKER>
<L>Thou counsell'st well,</L>
<L>And I will guide me by thy kind Advice.</L>
<L>O <HI>Pythia,</HI> how did every thing conspire</L>
<L>To give me hopes that I should place the Boy</L>
<L>Secure on <HI>Athens'</HI> Throne, unknown to all</L>
<L>But those whom Fate had made his firmest Friends.</L>
<L>The very Means I us'd to make it sure</L>
<L>Have been most adverse to the Cause I labour'd.</L>
<L>Had I relied on <HI>Xuthus'</HI> Piety,</L>
<L><PB N="52" REF="59"/>Nor mention'd <HI>Aeolus,</HI> Success were mine.</L>
<L>And let me hope it still. What most I fear</L>
<L>Is the Queen's Warmth of Passion. To which end</L>
<L>I must proceed with Tenderness, and hide</L>
<L>For some short time <HI>Ilyssus</HI> from her Knowledge.</L>
<L>I have unnumber'd Cautions to premise</L>
<L>Which her o'erflowing Joy may haply ruin.</L>
<L>The Banquet, is it ready?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PYTHIA.</SPEAKER>
<L>It has long</L>
<L>In vain expected its illustrious Guests.</L>
<L>The King already has forgot his Rage,</L>
<L>And hopes returning Thought may move the Queen</L>
<L>To equal Amity: He therefore finds</L>
<L>Continual Causes to delay the Feast.</L>

<L>It has no Joys for me. I fear, <HI>Aletes,</HI></L>

<L>Where are the Parents</L>
<L>Whom thou didst promise to my Hopes? Alas</L>
<L>I find no Parents here, no kind Regards,</L>
<L>No inexpressive Fondness. Stern Debate,</L>
<L>And foul Dissention kindle here their Torch</L>
<L>To usher in my Greatness. Ev'n <HI>Creusa,</HI></L>
<L><PB N="53" REF="60"/>Whose Tenderness I know not how alarm'd</L>
<L>My throbbing Heart with Hopes, and Doubts, and Fears,</L>
<L>Unfelt before, ev'n she has taught her Eyes</L>
<L>To look with Strangeness on me. The good King,</L>
<L>Who yet withdraws not his Protection from me,</L>
<L>Seems lost in anxious Thought.—Unkind <HI>Aletes,</HI></L>
<L>Art thou the Cause of this? Say, am I sprung</L>
<L>Of Race <HI>Aeolian?</HI> For by Heaven I swear,</L>
<L>By that pure Fountain of immortal Truth;</L>
<L>I will not brook Deceit. I will again,</L>
<L>Howe'er the glitt'ring Mischief tempt my Youth,</L>
<L>Become that humble unknown Thing I was,</L>
<L>Rather than wear a Crown by Falshood gain'd.</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>ALETES.</SPEAKER>
<L>My dearest Boy—</L>
<L>His Virtue charms me, tho' it may prevent <HI>Aside.</HI></L>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ALETES.</SPEAKER>
<L>What should I speak? This very Morn, <HI>Ilyssus,</HI></L>
<L>This very Morn I told thee a few Hours</L>
<L>Would shew thee what thou wert; but thy Impatience</L>
<L>Brooks not that short Delay. It seems <HI>Aletes</HI></L>
<L>Has lost his usual Credit with <HI>Ilyssus,</HI></L>
<L>Ev'n with the Youth his anxious Care has form'd.</L>
<L>Think'st thou the Man who taught thy feeling Heart</L>
<L>To start at Falshood, would himself commit</L>
<L><PB N="54" REF="61"/>The Fraud thou shudder'st at? What have I done,</L>
<L>Which should induce thee to a Thought so base?</L>
<L>Did e'er my Precepts contradict my Heart?</L>
<L>Did I e'er teach a Virtue I not practis'd?</L>
<L>—I see thou art confounded. Know then, Youth,</L>
<L>I blame not thy Impatience, nay I praise</L>
<L>That Modesty which can so soon resume</L>
<L>Its Seat, when all things round are big with Wonder.</L>
<L>Ere Night thou shalt know all; till then, <HI>Ilyssus,</HI></L>

<L>O good <HI>Aletes,</HI></L>
<L>Forgive my Rashness. Yes, I know thee honest</L>
<L>As Truth itself, and know the wond'rous Debt</L>
<L>I owe thy Goodness. Yet, if thou confess</L>
<L>That I have Reason for these anxious Cares,</L>
<L>Thou wilt permit me still to question thee.</L>
<L>Nay look upon me whilst I speak to thee.</L>
<L>Perhaps thou hast some secret Cause, <HI>Aletes,</HI></L>
<L>For all that kind Attention thou hast shewn me,</L>
<L>From Infancy till now? Why do'st thou turn</L>
<L>Thy Eyes to Earth? 'Tis plain thou hast a Cause:</L>
<L>Thou know'st from whom I spring; how can'st thou else</L>
<L>With Confidence assert, that yet ere Night</L>
<L>I shall know all?—Say this at least, <HI>Aletes,</HI></L>
<L>Shall the Queen's Anger cease?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ALETES.</SPEAKER>
<L>It shall, <HI>Ilyssus.</HI></L>
<L>Ev'n now I wait her here; on what Design</L>
<L>I must not yet inform thee. The next Time</L>
<L>Thou shalt behold her thou wilt find a Change</L>
<L>Incredible indeed, from Rage to Fondness,</L>
<L>From cold Reserve to Tears of bursting Joy.</L>

<SP>
<PB N="55" REF="62"/>
<L>—Ask me no more.—Yet something didst thou say</L>
<L>Relating to the Cause which fix'd me here</L>
<L>Thy Guardian, thy Instructor, and—the Time</L>
<L>Will come, when thou shalt know it all, <HI>Ilyssus,</HI></L>
<L>And bless my Memory.</L>

<L>Forbear, and leave me.</L>

<L>To meet no more.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ILYSSUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>No more! Thou wilt not leave me</L>
<L>When most I want thy Care! 'Twas my first Thought,</L>
<L>'Twas the first Boon I ask'd of the good King,</L>
<L>That thou might'st be my kind Instructor still.</L>
<L>He prais'd my Gratitude, and I had promis'd</L>
<L>To bring him to thy Cottage. He himself</L>
<L>Shall be a Suitor to thee.</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>ALETES.</SPEAKER>
<L>Thou hast ask'd</L>

<L>That <HI>Xuthus</HI> and <HI>Aletes</HI> e'er should meet</L>
<L>On terms of Amity. The Smiles of Greatness</L>
<L>To me have lost their Value. For thy Love</L>
<L>I could do much, and to be sever'd from thee</L>
<L>Pulls at my Heart-strings. But resistless Fate</L>
<L>Has fix'd its Seal, and we must part for ever,</L>
<L>How hard soe'er it seem. Thy Youth will soon,</L>
<L>Amidst the busy Scenes of active Greatness,</L>
<L>Forget its Monitor: But I must bear</L>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ALETES.</SPEAKER>
<L>If possible we will. If not, remember,</L>
<L>When thou shalt know thyself, that on thyself</L>
<L>Thy Fate depends; that Virtue, Glory, Happiness,</L>
<L>Are close connected, and their sad Reverse</L>
<L>Is Vice, is Pain, is Infamy.—Alas!</L>
<L>These were the Lessons of thy private Life,</L>
<L>This I have told thee oft, but my fond Tongue</L>
<L>Runs o'er its former Precepts, and forgets</L>
<L>Thou now must mount a Throne; a larger Scene</L>
<L>Of Duty opens.</L>

<L>Forget not thou wert once distress'd and friendless.</L>

<L>Temper thy Justice. From thy purged Ear</L>
<L>Banish base Flattery, and spurn the Wretch</L>

<L>Weak, erring, selfish Man, endued with Power</L>

<L>If Conquest charm thee, and the Pride of War</L>
<L>Blaze on thy Sight, remember thou art placed</L>
<L>The Guardian of Mankind, nor build thy Fame</L>
<L>On Rapines, and on Murders. Should soft Peace</L>
<L>Invite to Luxury, the pleasing Bane</L>
<L>Of happy Kingdoms, know from thy Example</L>
<L>The Bliss or Woe of nameless Millions springs,</L>
<L>Their Virtue, or their Vice. Nor think by Laws</L>

<HEAD>EPILOGUE.</HEAD>
<SP>
<STAGE>Spoken by Miss HAUGHTON, who acted the PYTHIA.</STAGE>
<LG>
<L>AT length I'm freed from Tragical Parade,</L>
<L>No more a <HI>Pythian</HI> Priestess,—tho' a Maid;</L>
<L>At once resigning, with my sacred Dwelling,</L>
<L>My Wreaths, my Wand, my Arts of Fortune-telling.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet superstitious Folks, no doubt, are here,</L>
<L>Who still regard me with a kind of Fear,</L>
<L>Lest to their secret Thoughts these prying Eyes</L>
<L>Should boldly pass, and take them by Surprize.</L>
<L>Nay, tho' I disavow the whole Deceit,</L>
<L>And fairly own my Science all a Cheat,</L>
<L>Should I declare, in spite of Ears and Eyes,</L>
<L>The Beaus were handsome, or the Critics wise,</L>
<L>They'd all believe it, and with dear Delight</L>
<L>Say to themselves at least,</L>
<L>"The Girl has Taste;" "the Woman's in the right."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Or, should I tell the Ladies, so dispos'd,</L>
<L>They'd get good Matches, ere the Season clos'd,</L>
<L>They'd smile, perhaps, with seeming Discontent,</L>
<L>And, sneering, wonder what the Creature meant;</L>
<L>But whisper to their Friends, with beating Heart.</L>
<L>"Suppose there should be something in her Art"</L>
<L>Grave Statesmen too would chuckle, should I say,</L>
<L>On such a Motion, and by such a Day,</L>
<L>They would be summon'd from their own Affairs</L>
<L>To 'tend the Nation's more important Cares;</L>
<L>"Well, if I must—howe'er I dread the Load,</L>
<L>"I'll undergo it—for my Country's Good.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>All Men are Bubbles, in a skilful Hand,</L>
<L>The ruling Passion is the Conjurer's Wand.</L>
<L>Whether we praise, foretell, persuade, advise,</L>
<L>'Tis that alone confirms us Fools or Wise.</L>
<L>The Devil without may spread the tempting Sin,</L>
<L>But the sure Conqueror <HI>is</HI>—the Devil within.</L>

<HEAD>A SECOND EPILOGUE.</HEAD>
<SP>
<STAGE>Spoken by Mrs. PRITCHARD.</STAGE>
<L>STAY, Ladies—Tho' I'am almost tir'd to Death</L>
<L>With this long Part—and am so out of Breath—</L>
<L>Yet such a lucky Thought kind Heaven has sent,</L>
<L>That if I die for't, I must give it Vent.</L>
<L>The Men you know are gone. And now, suppose,</L>
<L>Before our Lords and Masters are rechose,</L>
<L>We take th' Advantage of an empty Town,</L>
<L>And chuse a House of Commons of our own.</L>
<L>What think ye, cannot we make Laws?—and then</L>
<L>Cannot we too unmake them, like the Men?</L>
<L>O place us once in good St. <HI>Stephen's</HI> Pews,</L>
<L>We'll shew them Women have their public Use.</L>
<L>Imprimis they shall marry; not a Man</L>
<L>Past twenty-five, but what shall wear the Chain.</L>
<L>Next, we'll in earnest set about Reclaming,</L>
<L>For, by my Life and Soul, we'll put down Gaming.</L>
<L>We'll spoil their deep destructive Midnight Play;</L>
<L>The Laws we make, we'll force them to obey;</L>
<L>Unless we let them, when their Spirits flag,</L>
<L>Piddle with us, ye know, at Quinze and Brag.</L>
<L>"I hope, my Dearest," says some well-bred Spouse,</L>
<L>"When such a Bill shall come before your House,</L>
<L>"That you'll consider Men are Men—at least</L>
<L>"That you'll not Speak, my Dear."—Not speak?—The Beast!</L>
<L>What, would you wound my Honour?—Wrongs like these—</L>
<L>For this, Sir, I shall bring you on your Knees.</L>
<L>—Or, if we're quite good-natur'd, tell the Man</L>
<L>We'll do him all the Service that we can.</L>
<L>Then for ourselves, what Projects, what Designs?</L>
<L>We'll tax, and double tax their nasty Wines;</L>
<L>But Duty-free import our Blonds and Laces,</L>
<L><HI>French</HI> Hoops, <HI>French</HI> Silks, <HI>French</HI> Cambricks, and—<HI>French</HI> Faces.</L>
<L>In short, my Scheme is not compleated quite,</L>
<L>But I may tell ye more another Night.</L>
<L>So come again, come all, and let us raise</L>
<L>Such glorious Trophies to our Country's Praise,</L>
<L>That all true <HI>Britons</HI> shall with one Consent</L>
<L>Cry out, "Long live the Female Parliament!</L>
