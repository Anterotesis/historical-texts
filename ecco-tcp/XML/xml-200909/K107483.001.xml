<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HO' such <HI>ESSAYS,</HI> as com∣pose the following <HI>Volumes,</HI> are in <HI>Universal Esteem,</HI> and liable to every
One's <HI>Observations,</HI> yet it has not been my Fortune to meet with any <HI>Discourse</HI> written purposely upon the <HI>Nature</HI> of them.
The <HI>ESSAYISTS</HI> are apt to beat the <HI>Imagi∣nation</HI> in Search of <HI>strange</HI> and <HI>exotick Sub∣jects</HI> to write upon, while a <HI>Disquisition</HI> into their own <HI>Works,</HI> which are capable of
afford∣ing <HI>Matter</HI> so ample, seems to be intirely over∣looked by <HI>Them.</HI> In this resembling the human <HI>Mind,</HI> which while it
enters into, and examines the <HI>Depth</HI> of all other <HI>Sciences,</HI>
seems to consider nothing less than its own <HI>Motions.</HI></P>
<P>MOST other Kinds of <HI>Writing</HI> have, I think, been the <HI>Objects</HI> of <HI>Criticism,</HI> and <PB N="ii" REF="3"/> <HI>Rules</HI> and <HI>Orders</HI> have been laid down for the <HI>Writers</HI>
of them to <HI>Observe;</HI> but in this <HI>Spe∣cies,</HI> nobody is
confin'd; The only <HI>Rule</HI> that I know, (and it is generally well
observed) is not only to go without, but to go against all <HI>Order</HI>
and <HI>Method</HI> whatsoever. <HI>Montaigne,</HI> if I mistake not, was
the <HI>Inventor</HI> of it; and <HI>He</HI> is in all its <HI>Beauties</HI>
and <HI>Faults</HI> the best <HI>Pat∣tern</HI> to examine it by. <HI>He</HI>
has a great deal of <HI>Wit,</HI> much good <HI>Observation,</HI> and some <HI>Learn∣ing;</HI> but his <HI>ESSAYS</HI> are wild, rambling, and incoherent;
some of them don't treat at all of the <HI>Subjects</HI> propos'd, and others
might as well have any other Title as those they wear: They are, in effect,
like Mr. <HI>Bays</HI>'s <HI>Prologue,</HI> that would do either as <HI>Prologue</HI> or <HI>Epilogue,</HI> or serve indifferently for any other <HI>Play,</HI> as well as that which it was written for.</P>
<P>THO' there are to be found among the <HI>An∣tients</HI> some
little <HI>Tracts</HI> upon particular <HI>Subjects,</HI> which if they were
written at this <HI>Time,</HI> would be called <HI>ESSAYS;</HI> yet as they
were generally (if we except the <HI>Symposiacks</HI> of <HI>Plutarch</HI>)
made by <HI>Receipts,</HI> and done with a View to the <HI>Rules,</HI> which <HI>Orators</HI> and <HI>Declai∣mers</HI> laid down for such <HI>Compositions;</HI> the Honour of this <HI>Invention</HI> must still
be ascribed to <HI>Montaigne,</HI> who first introduced that useful <HI>Practice</HI> of <HI>Digression</HI> into <HI>Treatises</HI> upon
select <HI>Subjects;</HI> and by giving us every whimsical <HI>Con∣ceit</HI> that came into his Head, has led us as it were dancing after
his <HI>Morality,</HI> much more pleasantly <PB N="iii" REF="4"/> than if we
walked in the Stilts, or were di∣rected by the Leading-Strings which <HI>Seneca</HI> had accustomed us to. <HI>Montaigne</HI> had a great many
Followers in <HI>France,</HI> and some in this Country: But the best, and
he that excelled his <HI>Original,</HI> was <HI>La Bruyere;</HI> the finest
and most delicate <HI>Remarks,</HI> the strongest <HI>Sense,</HI> and
the justest <HI>Reasoning,</HI> all embellished by an Elegance of <HI>Style,</HI> and a Felicity of <HI>Expression,</HI> are to be found in
his <HI>Works;</HI> to which we must add, that the frequent <HI>Egotisms;</HI> the needless <HI>Quo∣tations,</HI> the whimsical <HI>Display</HI> of the Author's <HI>Character</HI> and <HI>Manners</HI> at
every Period, and other Impertinences which pass upon some for <HI>Humour,</HI> are not to be met with in him. He has all the <HI>Variety,</HI> and an Appearance of the <HI>Irregularity</HI> which
pleases, but intirely divested of the <HI>Digression</HI> and <HI>Distraction</HI> which consound and disgust the <HI>READER</HI> in
these Performan∣ces. In short, reading <HI>Montaigne,</HI> is Hunt∣ing in a
Country where you start so much <HI>Game</HI> as to spoil your <HI>Sport;</HI> while <HI>La Bruyere</HI> gives you all the <HI>Pleasure</HI>
and <HI>Variety</HI> of the <HI>Chace,</HI> without the Fatigue of following
the <HI>Prey</HI> too far.</P>
<P>WITHOUT arraigning the <HI>Taste</HI> of others, I will venture
to say, That very little in this Way, worth <HI>Observation,</HI> has
appeared at Home till the <HI>TATLER</HI> began to retail his Pennyworths of <HI>WIT.</HI> Several <HI>Political Tracts,</HI> it is true, have come forth,
and some <HI>Argumentative Discourses</HI> which had their 
<PB N="iv" REF="5"/> Shares of <HI>Merit;</HI> but did not come properly within
this Species of <HI>Writing.</HI> The Character of <HI>BICKERSTAFFE,</HI> had
it been real, was more upon the <HI>Humourist</HI> and <HI>Whimsical</HI>
than that of <HI>Montaigne;</HI> and I believe the Fiction which was seen in
it, by being natural, heighten'd the Pleasure which it gave us; besides,
the Limits of his Paper prevented his being so diffuse and prolix, as we
often find the <HI>Frenchman,</HI> who for want of such a Confinement,
sometimes dis∣gusts us. The <HI>SPECTATOR,</HI> and <HI>NESTOR
IRONSIDE,</HI> are <HI>Characters</HI> also excellently well adapted to the
Creation of our <HI>Pleasures,</HI> by our <HI>Knowledge</HI> of their being
Fictitious: For such is our Malignity of <HI>Temper,</HI> that we can't
forgive a real <HI>Author</HI> acting or thinking oddly or idly, though our <HI>Entertainment</HI> arises from thence, because we consider him as a
rea∣sonable Man, and obliged by a superior <HI>Duty</HI> to another kind of <HI>Behaviour;</HI> but we can in∣dulge an imaginary, or assumed
Personage in any ludicrous, frolicksome or whimsical <HI>Words</HI> or <HI>Opinions,</HI> because we know that he only plays the <HI>Fool</HI> for
our <HI>Delight</HI> and <HI>Amusement,</HI> which we grudge him to do for
his own. Thus <HI>Montaigne</HI>'s Faults are the Beauties of <HI>BICKERSTAFFE</HI> and <HI>IRONSIDE;</HI> and thus <HI>Cibber</HI> and <HI>Hippesly</HI> are applauded on the <HI>Stage,</HI> for what they would in
private <HI>Life</HI> run the Ha∣zard of <HI>Correction.</HI></P>
<P>CERTAINLY, writing under an assump∣tive <HI>Character</HI> is
a fine Improvement in this <PB N="v" REF="6"/> <HI>Way;</HI> and I believe the <HI>Novelty</HI> of it, without derogating from the <HI>Wit, Humour,</HI> good <HI>Sense,</HI> or excellent <HI>Style</HI> of those mentioned <HI>Papers,</HI> made up the greatest Part of their <HI>Merit:</HI> The
little Incidents of human <HI>Life,</HI> Pieces of <HI>Conversation,</HI> and
familiar <HI>Arguments,</HI> which may be thrown into <HI>Writing</HI> under
such a <HI>Cha∣racter,</HI> give it the <HI>Advantage</HI> of all other <HI>Me∣thods</HI>: And I am of <HI>Opinion</HI> it must eternally <HI>Please</HI> (and the Success of the following <HI>Papers,</HI> when
first publish'd, corroborates the Opinion) if as new <HI>Matter</HI> is
continually rising, some <HI>Geni∣us's</HI> could be found able to treat it
in a Manner equal to their <HI>Predecessors.</HI> Tho' perhaps, <HI>The
Stamp Act</HI> first, and then the Rise and Multi∣plication of <HI>Weekly
Journals,</HI> are now such Im∣pediments to a fair Hearing in this <HI>Method,</HI> as almost amount to a <HI>Prohibition</HI> of such <HI>ESSAYS</HI> for the future.</P>
<P>THE Invention of <HI>Weekly Journals,</HI> was, I believe owing to
the <HI>Taste</HI> which the Town be∣gan to entertain from the Writings of
the <HI>TATLER, SPECTATOR,</HI> and others. Small <HI>ESSAYS</HI> were so
much liked, that it was imagined worth while to put a little <HI>Wit,</HI> and
a great deal of <HI>History</HI> in a large Quantity of Pa∣per, and sell it
for the same or a less Price than <HI>The Stamp Duty</HI> had rais'd the
half Sheet <HI>Treatise</HI> to. The <HI>Project</HI> succeeded, and we
have had several excellent <HI>Things</HI> publish'd in that <HI>Way;</HI>
some that in their <HI>Fame</HI> almost rivall'd any <HI>Thing</HI> that
went before them, but <PB N="vi" REF="7"/> by the Nature of their <HI>Subjects,</HI> ought to be excluded from this <HI>Class</HI> of <HI>Writing;</HI> which whatever Liberties Men take, ought never to be drawn
into Controversies about <HI>Religion</HI> or <HI>Government,</HI> Things
that, to be sure, require a more orderly and regular manner of Treating, than
is consistent with the Freedom and Latitude of an <HI>ESSAY.</HI></P>
<P>BUT, as I hinted before, we have almost lost the Advantage of <HI>Entertaining</HI> in any other <HI>Manner;</HI> the <HI>Journals</HI> come
abroad so seldom, that if a <HI>Humour</HI> was begun, Men would for∣get it
before it could be prosecuted, and the <HI>Jest</HI> would be lost before
it was found. The general Way now of communicating our <HI>Thoughts</HI> to the
Publick, is, by distinct and unconnected <HI>Letters</HI> to the <HI>Author</HI> of this or that <HI>Journal,</HI> and the common assumed <HI>Characters</HI> are, a <HI>Phi∣losopher,</HI> a <HI>Critick,</HI> or a <HI>Divine;</HI> in these, some important <HI>Point</HI> is constantly
laid down, and as gravely and solemnly discussed. Thus we intrude upon
the <HI>Pulpit,</HI> and seem not to think that to mend the <HI>Heart</HI> it
is necessary to please the <HI>Imagination.</HI></P>
<P>THIS certainly is missing the <HI>Mark,</HI> and these
little <HI>ESSAYS</HI> are written in the truest <HI>Taste,</HI> when they
cloath good <HI>Sense</HI> with <HI>Humour,</HI> and embellish good <HI>Morals</HI> with <HI>Wit;</HI> when they instruct <HI>Familiarly,</HI>
and reprove <HI>Pleasantly;</HI> when they don't swell above <HI>Com∣prehension,</HI> nor sink below <HI>Delicacy:</HI> In short, 
<PB N="vii" REF="8"/> when they adapt the <HI>Wisdom</HI> of the <HI>Antients</HI> to the <HI>Gust</HI> of the <HI>Moderns,</HI> and
constrain <HI>Montaigne</HI>'s Pleasantry within <HI>BICKERSTAFFE</HI>'s
Compass.</P>
<P>I CAN'T conclude without mentioning two Objections, which
amongst others, these Sort of <HI>Writings,</HI> and their <HI>Authors,</HI> are liable to, the first is, That as from the <HI>Nature</HI> of their Subjects, it is often necessary they should be <HI>Occasional,</HI> which requires <HI>Dispatch,</HI> and pre∣vents that <HI>Accuracy,</HI> which much <HI>Leisure,</HI> and frequent <HI>Reviews,</HI> generally produce in other <HI>Works,</HI> that in such
Cases, to sketch out, or design well, is as much as can be performed, which
certainly can give the <HI>Mind</HI> but a half <HI>Pleasure,</HI> and so
far the <HI>Work</HI> must necessarily be <HI>Imperfect.</HI></P>
<P>THE Second is to be found in <HI>Ben Johnson</HI>'s
Discoveries, which therefore take in his own Words.</P>
<Q>SOME that turn over all Books, and are equally searching in all
Papers, that write out of what they presently find or meet without Choice; by
which means it happens that what they have discredited and impug∣ned in one
Work, they have before or after extolled the same in another. Such are all
the <HI>Essayists,</HI> even their Master <HI>Montaigne.</HI> These
in all they write, confess still what Books they have read last; and
therein their <PB N="viii" REF="9"/> own Folly, so much, that they bring it to
the Stake <HI>raw</HI> and <HI>undigested:</HI> Not that the Place did need
it neither, but that they thought themselves furnished, and would vent
it.</Q>
<P>THESE <HI>Objections</HI> had not been mention∣ed, but that we
believe the following <HI>Pieces</HI> stand clear of them; the Reception
which was at first given them, encourages us in that <HI>Thought,</HI> and it
is hoped, That from a Peru∣sal of them, the candid <HI>READER</HI> will
enter∣tain the same <HI>Opinion.</HI></P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>HEN a <HI>Stranger</HI> comes into Com∣pany, the Whisper goes
round, <HI>Who is He?</HI> and the Face each Man wears, is the Effect of his
In∣formation: You ought therefore, to know, who I <HI>am,</HI> that you may
regard what I <HI>say</HI>; and then, it is to be hop'd, we shall
converse without Jealousy.</P>
<P>I AM a talkative <HI>Old Batchelor,</HI> in my grand Climacterick,
of a sanguine Complexion; well-limb'd, strong and hearty; in Stature more
than middling; my Face is round and smooth, <PB N="2" REF="11"/> my Forehead
high and open, my Eye-brows are widely arch'd, my Teeth sound, and white; I
have a Nose a little <HI>Aquiline,</HI> Eyes black and spritely; my Hair is
brown and short, but somewhat of the thinnest, with a Silver∣ing of Grey
among it: I wear my Cloaths plain, am a great Lover of Walking, and go commonly
alone; I carry a pair of Mouse-colour'd Gloves in one Hand, and my Oaken
Stick in the other, instead of a Cane; for I am naturally partial to the
Manufactures of my Country, and an irreconcileable Enemy to the <HI>East-India Company.</HI></P>
<P>MY Father, who was one of the <HI>Cavaliers</HI> of the last
Century, had a <HI>Dash</HI> in his <HI>Temper,</HI> of what his
Mistresses called <HI>Surly</HI>; but he was of frank Heart and simple
Manners. There was an unlucky kind of Contrast in his Dis∣position, for
he was Amorous, but Unpolish'd: He seems to have been rather Serious, than
Witty; yet he lov'd Wit in others, and was particularly charm'd with the
Wantonness of Mrs. <HI>Behn.</HI> That arch Baggage has made bold, in her
Comedy, called the <HI>Rover,</HI> both with his Name, and his
Character.—Who∣ever has seen <HI>Ned Blunt,</HI> has seen, not the <HI>Copy,</HI> but the very <HI>Life</HI> of my Father.</P>
<P>HE left me an Estate, rather moderate than plentiful; which I
have neither improv'd, nor diminish'd. I was naturally dispos'd to Quiet,
and affected to think calmly: For this <HI>Reason</HI> I have obstinately
resisted MARRIAGE. I pass my Summers at <HI>Blunt-Hall,</HI> the ancient 
<PB N="3" REF="12"/> Seat of our Family, in the dirtiest Part of <HI>Sussex:</HI> My Winters I enjoy in Town, where I am the oldest Member
now alive of an Assem∣bly, of both Sexes, very numerous and diver∣sified:
We meet, twice a Week, at the House of a sober Widow, whom we placed there
on Purpose. But, because I delight in Study, and am an Enemy to the Faction
and Flutter of the Polite End of the Town, I have my Lodgings in a low-built,
silent House in the City, which has a large, shady Garden, and covers the
very <HI>Spot,</HI> where, of old, as <HI>Stow</HI> tells me, stood the
Watch-Tower of <HI>Barbican.</HI></P>
<P>IT has always been my Custom, To keep a daily Account, in
Writing, of my Actions and Observations, even to Particulars of no seem∣ing
Importance. By Help of these Notes, I live over again my past Time, and
learn Wis∣dom from my Follies.—I have lately been reflecting, and taken
it stongly into my Fancy, That, wanting Children of my own, I should be
Every Body's Father: I have so many Things to say, and am so naturally
fond of <HI>Teaching,</HI> that I promise my self no small <HI>Fame,</HI>
from the Success of my Weekly Coun∣sel: The SUBJECT of my PAPER gave me
little or no Pain: My Propensity to Talking required, That it should be <HI>General,</HI> and <HI>Un∣boundedly Copious</HI>; But the NAME was a <HI>Dif∣ficulty,</HI> that I could not easily get over: That <HI>Large</HI>
Part of Mankind, which consists of SUPERFICIALISTS, judging every Thing by
Ap∣pearance, <HI>taste</HI> but coldly of a Meaning which <PB N="4" REF="13"/>
is not <HI>dress'd</HI> to their <HI>Relish</HI>; and the <HI>Will,</HI>
that is too stubborn to bend to the <HI>Fancy,</HI> shall hard∣ly be able
to work upon the <HI>Understanding.</HI></P>
<P>THIS Doubt was so knotty, that I sub∣mitted it to the <HI>Assembly,</HI> where a learned <HI>Clergyman</HI> spoke first, and
was for calling it the INQUISITOR; He was honestly proceed∣ing to give his <HI>Reasons</HI> for that Name, but was smartly interrupted by an <HI>Alderman</HI>'s Wife, who, with Eyes full of Fire, and Face as red as her
Ribbands, told him, <HI>That, however the</HI> Inquisition <HI>might agree
with</HI> His <HI>Principles, it would never go down with</HI> honest <HI>People and</HI> Protestants:—<HI>If you desire,</HI> (said
she to me) <HI>That your</HI> PAPER <HI>should be read by the</HI> Friends <HI>of the</HI> Government, <HI>you should give it a</HI> sober <HI>Name,
and call it the</HI> TRUTH-TELLER.</P>
<P>A pert <HI>Coquet,</HI> who sate next her, a Toast, and a
great Fortune, burst into a loud Laugh; <HI>Oh! Heavens!</HI> cry'd the
Gipsey, <HI>I shall faint at the odious Formality of that</HI> Title! <HI>Ah, Ma∣dam! How could you be so unreasonably mistaken! The</HI>
TRUTH-TELLER!—<HI>Lord, deliver us! why, the</HI> COURT <HI>can never
bear it! and all the</HI> gay World <HI>will despise and abhor
it!—No, no, if you wish your</HI> PAPER <HI>to</HI> Spread <HI>and
grow</HI> Publick, <HI>you have nothing to resolve, but to call it the</HI>
SECRET.</P>
<P><HI>FOR my Part,</HI> answered a grave Virgin, about Fifty, <HI>I think they would do well to entitle it the</HI> COQUET; <HI>There's
scarce a Fop in Town but would be fond of that Name; for he would consider
the</HI> PAPER <HI>as his</HI> Property.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="14"/>A FAMOUS <HI>Critick</HI> interposing,
remark'd, <HI>That the</HI> Taste <HI>of the Age was so vitiated, that no
Name could be acceptable, unless it were</HI> Mu∣sical; <HI>and the</HI>
Wind, (says he,) <HI>of Modern Ar∣guments, being an Over-match for their</HI>
Weight, <HI>I am for calling it the</HI> BAGPIPE.—<HI>Oh! much rather
the</HI> FLUTE, <HI>reply'd the</HI> Coquet; <HI>The</HI> BAGPIPE <HI>is so
filthy, so horrible an Instru∣ment! that 'twould be impossible to bear
the Sound of it, unless 'twere introduc'd in an</HI> Opera.</P>
<P>A <HI>Justice</HI> of the <HI>Quorum,</HI> my next Neigh∣bour in
the Country, and an eminent <HI>Fox-hunter,</HI> maintain'd, with invincible
Strength, both of <HI>Voice</HI> and <HI>Authority, That it ought, by all
Means, since it was intended for</HI> Society, <HI>to be called the</HI> GOOD
FELLOW; But he bow'd, and chang'd his Mind, when our <HI>Alderman's Young
Daughter,</HI> who sate at her Mother's Elbow, blush'd, and whisper'd in
his Ear, <HI>That for her Part, she could think of no Name, that would be
so pretty, as the</HI> SWEET∣HEART.</P>
<P>AN <HI>Old Maid</HI> of the Widow's, to whom, for
Pleasantry-sake, we indulge the Familiari∣ty, and Privilege of
Impertinence, had been standing all this while behind her Mistress's
Chair, and broke out, on a sudden, with an Air of Amazement; <HI>Hey Day! if
you must</HI> whip <HI>it about thus, and keep it constantly spin∣ning,
the best Thing you can do is, To call it the</HI> WHIRLIGIG. All the Company
laugh'd at the Wench's Conceit; 'till the <HI>Critick,</HI> assume∣ing a
surpriz'd and decisive Air, assur'd us, <PB N="6" REF="15"/>
positively, <HI>It</HI> must <HI>take; for that No Body could fail to
expect as much Wit, at least, in the</HI> WHIRLIGIG, <HI>as in the</HI>
What-d'ye-call it.</P>
<P>I was unsatisfied with All This; and having a natural Partiality
to my own Character, I bethought my-self of the PLAIN DEALER. The whole
Assembly agreed in Approbation of That Name, and gave it, as their
Joint-Opinion, <HI>That, Whether it would be generally</HI> liked <HI>or no, it
was never more generally</HI> wanted.</P>
<P>THE <HI>LADIES,</HI> when they hear, That my Design is PLAIN
DEALING, will consider me perhaps, as an Old-fashion'd Fellow, who can have
nothing to do with Them; yet I know they will be frequently kind enough to
furnish me with Business, and I shall handle them, as often as they
allow me Opportunity.—The CHURCH and the STATE I have no great Genius for
meddling with; They are either <HI>well</HI> as they <HI>are,</HI> or will
never be the <HI>better</HI> for any Thing I can <HI>say</HI> to them. But
the <HI>Passions,</HI> the <HI>Humours,</HI> the <HI>Follies,</HI> the <HI>Disquiets,</HI> the <HI>Plea∣sures,</HI> and the <HI>Graces</HI> of <HI>Human Life,</HI> All these I claim a Right to consider as my Subjects;
and shall treat them, without Prejudice, in the most frank and open Manner;
so that the <HI>Watch-Tower</HI> of <HI>Barbican</HI> shall again resume
its Use, and <HI>overlook</HI> this Antient CITY, for Her <HI>Ser∣vice,</HI>
and Her <HI>Safety.</HI></P>

<P>THREE Enormous Abuses, have grown of late Years to a
scandalous Heighth among us, <HI>Masquerading, Gaming,</HI> and <HI>Stock-Jobbing.</HI> They are Enemies to the Civil So∣ciety of Mankind, and
Destroyers of that va∣luable Doctrine of PLAIN DEALING which I would so
earnestly recommend.</P>
<P><HI>MASQUERADES</HI> are the Undoers of Beau∣ty, Honour, and
Innocence, and, methinks it should be enough to deter any young <HI>Lady,</HI> if she did but reflect upon this Great Truth, That her
Masque, has, at best, thrown a Cloud upon her Reputation, that will hang
heavy for a long Time after, and sink her in the Esteem of her former
Admirers.</P>
<P>AS to <HI>Gaming,</HI> the Sons of our Nobility, and the Heirs to
plentiful Estates, especial∣ly those who become too early their own
Masters, are the Victims of Sharpers, the Prey of those Man-hunters, who
form Asso∣ciations <PB N="8" REF="17"/> to over-turn as many Honest
So∣cieties as they can; and only live in Peace to∣gether, by being united in a
Confederacy to spread Desolation among others. The Heads of our best
Families may not improperly be called the GAME of this wide-wasting
Fra∣ternity.</P>
<P><HI>STOCK-JOBBING</HI> is the Overthrow of all regular Commerce,
and involves many a rich Trader, in the utmost Distress.</P>
<P>THESE Three Grand Enormities stand in direct Opposition to
PLAIN DEALING; and the Province which I have undertaken, demands of me to
declare War against them, and exert my best Endeavours to remove them out
of the Way as fast as I am able. They grow out of the Obliquity of a Mind,
that meditates an unnatural Increase of its own Ease, by di∣minishing the
Satisfaction of other People, and filling them with Uneasiness and
Disquiet. These Subjects are so fruitful, that I shall im∣ploy this
whole Paper upon the <HI>Masquerades</HI> alone, and defer the Correction of
the other to a second Opportunity.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Count</HI> of the <HI>ill-favour'd Visage</HI> may may
be considered as the Leader and Captain-General of these Forces; and
therefore, if in entring into a single Combat with him, I am valiant enough
to get the better, I doubt not but the Army under his Command will pull off
their Masques, in Respect to my Victory, and not be ashamed to shew
their Faces, when they appear on the side that is uppermost.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="18"/>THEY who lay <HI>Masques</HI> to the <HI>Count</HI>'s Charge, have accounted for it very pleasantly, and will have
it to be a politick Undertaking. He ought, say they, by the Laws of Sympathy
to have Regard to a Vizor, since his <HI>natural</HI> Countenance bears
such Resemblance to those <HI>artificial</HI> ones, that the only means
in his Power to look like a <HI>Man,</HI> was to teach every Man to look like a <HI>Monster.</HI></P>
<P>BUT I am not in a Humour to content my self with such
abstracted Speculations, which appear to me to be artfully framed on
purpose to <HI>excuse</HI> a Man they pretend to find fault with. It is
true, they make a Jest of the Person, but they throw a <HI>Masque</HI>
over the Mind, which ought certainly to be most cha∣stised. I dare
swear for the <HI>Count,</HI> it is not his nature to be angry with any Body,
that, by handling his <HI>Face</HI> a little <HI>freely,</HI> gives him a <HI>handsome</HI> Opportunity for handling the <HI>Pockets</HI> of other
People. <HI>Greater</HI> Statesmen than <HI>He,</HI> have been contented to
look <HI>silly</HI> for a <HI>wise</HI> End, and to become the Jests of
the People, when they have been sure of an <HI>Equi∣valent.</HI> This makes
me afraid that these Waggs, who speak of him with so much seeming
Smartness, are his Friends at the bot∣tom, and I doubt, if the Truth were
known, he has bribed them to be of his Party by let∣ting them now and then,
into the <HI>Secrets</HI> of <HI>Masquerading.</HI></P>
<P>I MUST therefore take leave to look a little seriously into
this Matter, and I am afraid we <PB N="10" REF="19"/> shall find, That the <HI>Count</HI> has not so much a Design to make Persons of Quality with
their Masques on, look like the <HI>Count,</HI> as to make the <HI>Count</HI>
look like Persons of Quality with their Masques off.</P>
<P>SEVERAL Clergymen, some Bishops, and other grave Personages,
have thought this a Matter of <HI>Importance</HI> enough to take Notice of as
well as I; but still, it seems, the <HI>Count</HI> is secretly resolved
to have Wit enough to take no notice of any of us. It must be allowed indeed,
That he is a Person of uncommon Parts, to stand Proof against the
Reasoning of so many Learned, and Great Men, without be∣ing in the least
convinced or perswaded.</P>
<P>BUT, tho' this Power, of resisting the Force of so many
Eloquent Reasoners, proves him a Prodigy in <HI>Genius,</HI> and
demonstrates him to have a world of Wit, yet I would not have him forget,
that there is <HI>some</HI> Merit also, in <HI>Mo∣desty.</HI> If a
Clergyman or a Bishop, give their Opinions against him, he thinks it
sufficient to shrug his Shoulders, and say, grinning in his own Defence,
That he wonders they should make such a Bustle, <HI>for that a Domine, a
Cassock, and a Mitre, are the most common Masques in Fashion.</HI>
This raises a loud Laugh, and he comes off cleverly among the <HI>young
Fel∣lows;</HI> but he must not imagine to escape so with Persons of <HI>my</HI> Gravity.</P>
<P>SEVERAL old Counsellors of State, and at Law, grave
Physicians, ancient Citizens, and worthy Country Gentlemen, just come up
with <PB N="11" REF="20"/> their Wives and Daughters, to pay a Visit to the
Town, have all complained of him in their Turns, and met with no better
Quarter, and notwithstanding all they can say to the contrary, he has
continued to carry on his Shew with very successful Raillery: I expect that
he will give <HI>me</HI> my Share of his Taunts among the rest; but I have as
little Taste for his <HI>Wit,</HI> as I have for his <HI>Sweetmeats</HI>; and
to deal plainly with him, I am in no such merry Vein, as he may think, when I
tell him this unwelcome Truth, That the Effects of <HI>Mas∣querades,</HI> are
very serious Things to Husbands, and Fathers, tho' they are Jokes to him and
to <HI>some,</HI> who are pleas'd to support him. I must, therefore,
desire him to lay aside his <HI>Wit,</HI> and consider, with a little <HI>Wisdom,</HI> whether He may not be in Danger of falling hereafter in∣to
the Clutches of a certain dark Enemy, who is now his Friend in <HI>Masquerade,</HI> and who will not be so easily eluded.</P>
<P>HE may recollect, if he pleases, in one of the <HI>Masquerades,</HI> a strange Spectacle, like a Man, whom he took, at
first, to have a Vizard on, but found upon a more narrow Exami∣nation to have
exactly the Lineaments of his own Face, the same Shape, the same Air, the
same Gait, the same Cloaths, as himself, and his very Wig of the same
Colour, and hang∣ing with the Fore-top on one Tip of the Ear, just like his
own: He may remember, that this ghastly Mimick, constantly attended him,
that whole Night, did every thing that he did; <PB N="12" REF="21"/> said
every thing he said; and went to every Place where he went: He may remember,
that he was struck with a terrible Panick, and did not know what to think of
this uninvited Companion of his, but took him, sometimes, for a meer Mimick;
sometimes for a Spectre, but at last he was convinced, that it cou'd be no
other, than the <HI>Devil,</HI> which a great many <HI>well-meaning</HI> People
believ'd was certainly the Truth: and he very well knows, that he, and his
Companion, were easily mistaken for one another, and that no body at last
could well tell which was the <HI>Count,</HI> and which was the <HI>Devil.</HI></P>
<P>THO' the <HI>Count,</HI> as the Phrase goes of him, looks <HI>bad</HI> enough at the <HI>best,</HI> he was remark'd to look much
worse after this Vision, than at any time before: He was for many Days much
dejected, and profoundly pensive and melan∣choly, and the terrible
Apprehensions he was under, caused a visible Increase of Wrinkles, and
furrow'd him into such Frightfulness, that if ever he went to <HI>take
Coach,</HI> the <HI>Horses</HI> wou'd start, and run away from
him.—But one Day, above the rest, when he was deep in the doleful Mood,
an airy young Fellow hear∣ing him say, He intended to have no more <HI>Masquerades,</HI> got out of him the <HI>Secret</HI> of his <HI>Disorder:</HI> This Youth who was afraid, that if that Diversion
discontinued, he should not suc∣ceed with a Lady, for whose sake He
was us'd to <HI>hide</HI> his <HI>Face,</HI> that he might charm her, with
less Difficulty, found an Expedient <PB N="13" REF="22"/> to free the <HI>Count</HI> from his Fears, and made him believe, that it was a <HI>Trick</HI> of the <HI>Prince de Monte Aspero.</HI> But the poor <HI>Count</HI> is im∣posed on, if he gives Credit to that fictitious Story,
and might have been better advertis'd of the Truth, if he had only had an Eye
to the <HI>Club-Foot,</HI> which stood out, and <HI>plainly shewed</HI> his
Companion, as several innocent Spectators then present could testify.
Besides, as a <HI>Poet,</HI> who would preserve <HI>Probability,</HI> could
produce no Body proper to personate <HI>Amphitryon</HI> but <HI>Jupiter,</HI>
nor to mimick <HI>Sofia</HI> to the Life but <HI>Mercury</HI>; so the <HI>Count,</HI> if he reflects sufficiently, upon his Person, Parts, and
Qualities, must of necessity be convinc'd, in his Mind, that since
nothing <HI>Human</HI> could so exactly resemble him, It <HI>must</HI>
be, at least, a <HI>Cacodaemon.</HI></P>
<P>UPON the whole, if he lay this seriously to heart, as I hope
he will, he will lay aside jesting, become a true Penitent, and take the
good Time of <HI>Lent</HI> to consider, Whether it will not be proper to quit
all Thoughts of <HI>Masquerading,</HI> for fear that Ghastly Figure that
once took his Person <HI>upon</HI> him, shou'd the next Time, <HI>take
off</HI> his Person.</P>

<P>SO weak is the <HI>Frailty</HI> of Human Nature, that we can never
be too <HI>secure,</HI> tho' <HI>arm'd</HI> with the sublimest <HI>Vertue,</HI> against the repeated <HI>Attacks</HI> of so many <HI>Passions,</HI> as constantly be∣siege us; and, tho' the Garrison
of the Mind may be never so well provided with all Means of Resistance,
the greatest of <HI>Qualities, Ver∣tues,</HI> and <HI>Perfections,</HI> that
our Nature is capa∣ble of attaining; nevertheless <HI>Treachery,</HI>
with∣in, <HI>Force</HI> or <HI>Stratagem,</HI> from without, may sur∣prize
and defeat us: An Example of which Infirmity the following <HI>Story</HI> will
furnish the Reader, and teach him, of all Things, to avoid, what is call'd <HI>Spiritual Pride,</HI> That Con∣tempt of another for not being so good, as
himself, when he sees how, in an Instant, the greatest Piety and
Religion, may be chang'd, (by indulging only one dangerous <HI>Passion</HI>) into the other Extream of <HI>Wickedness</HI>; so
that <PB N="15" REF="24"/> we may apply to the Lubricity of Human Vertue, what a
wise Man of <HI>Greece,</HI> said of <HI>Happiness,</HI> That it can
never be determin'd, 'till Death.</P>
<P>IN the following <HI>Story,</HI> which is true, as to Fact, I
shall be obliged to <HI>disguise</HI> some <HI>Cir∣cumstances</HI> of
Time and Place, to prevent the unfortunate Subject of this <HI>Paper,</HI> or
his <HI>Fa∣mily,</HI> from being known, so that it will be enough to inform
the <HI>Reader,</HI> That, less than half an <HI>Age</HI> ago, there liv'd a
certain Gentle∣man, of good <HI>Birth</HI> and <HI>Fortune,</HI> who had
polish'd, and finish'd, a Learned Education by the Improvement of a <HI>Camp,</HI> and a <HI>Court</HI>; in Both which He spent some Time; when
about the Thirtieth Year of his Age, he thought fit to settle himself in
the World, and change his <HI>Condition,</HI> by chusing a Partner of <HI>Life,</HI> whose <HI>Mind</HI> was as well Adorn'd, as her <HI>Per∣son</HI> was Engaging: This happy <HI>Couple</HI> spent Five Years
together, in perfect Felicity; the <HI>Husband</HI> with Reputation, as well as
Fortune, and the <HI>Wife</HI> with Vertue, not inferior to her Beauty.</P>
<P>BUT what crown'd all their <HI>Bliss,</HI> was, That mutual <HI>Esteem</HI> they had contracted for one another; in this time they had
two or three <HI>Children,</HI> who all dy'd in their Infancy: And now, it
pleas'd Heaven to snatch, from this <HI>happy</HI> Man, the only Joy and
Comfort of his <HI>Life</HI>; his Charming Spouse died, and left him not only
an inconsolable, but almost distracted, <HI>Widower:</HI> When the
first Emotions <PB N="16" REF="25"/> of <HI>Grief</HI> were over, he retir'd,
from his own House, to a little Farm, in another <HI>Country,</HI> where no <HI>Object</HI> should come in his <HI>way,</HI> to revive in his Memory the <HI>Loss</HI> of his lament∣ed <HI>Wife:</HI> Here he spent two Years,
which led him into the Thirty Eighth of his <HI>Life:</HI> this Time he divided
between his Studies and Devotion; being <HI>Religious</HI> from his very
In∣fancy: Which natural <HI>Piety</HI> was, now, so much increas'd, by his
late Loss, that at last he resolv∣ed to quit his Native Country, and to
retire into a <HI>Convent,</HI> being born, and bred in the Roman Catholick
Communion.</P>
<P>THIS Resolution was no sooner known to his Friends, but they
endeavour'd to <HI>divert</HI> it, by all manner of <HI>Persuasions</HI>
and <HI>Arguments</HI>; by remonstrating to him, That he was, now, in the
Flower of his Age, and blest with a plentiful <HI>Fortune</HI> to give him
all the Comforts and Pleasures of <HI>Life</HI>; that it would be un∣just,
thus, to fling himself away, not only to himself, but his Friends and
Family, to whom he ow'd the Debt, which he had contracted, for Posterity to
continue his Name: They told him, That he had paid all the Tribute to the
Memory of his deceas'd Wife, that the Laws of Honour, Decency, and the
Obligations of a good Husband required; that he was now at Liberty to make
another Choice; that one good Woman was not a Phoenix, but that others of the
same Species might be found, to make him as happy as before.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="26"/>THESE Arguments, tho' back'd with Rea∣son,
were all ineffectual; he was deaf to every Remonstrance; and pass'd over
into <HI>Flanders,</HI> where he plac'd himself, at first, as Pensioner
in a Religious House; and liv'd with the same Strictness, that even the
Rules of that Order requir'd from those, who were under Vows of such
Austerities; nor did he receive more Edi∣fication from the Example of others,
than he gave by his own.</P>
<P>AFTER a Life led, for some time, with the greatest Esteem
and Reputation, he com∣municated to the Superiors of the House, his ardent
Desire of being receiv'd into their Society: The good Fathers, tho' inwardly
pleas'd with the Honour of having so excellent a Person, in their Order,
did not receive his Proposal with that Chearfulness, which he ex∣pected:
Their Prudence suggested to them, that he was yet too young a Man, to be
real∣ly, upon good Grounds, disgusted with the World, into the Love of
which he lay under great Temptations of relapsing, by reason of that large
Fortune, which could furnish Means of enjoying those Pleasures, which he
must now for ever abandon; and the Loss of which, if he should repent his
Vows, would make him as miserable, as he propos'd to himself to to be
happy: They conjur'd him, at the same time, strictly to search his own
Heart, so as to be convinced, that this Desire was an Im∣pulse, and Call
from God, and not any Tem∣porary Disgust of the World, which might 
<PB N="18" REF="27"/> blow over, and vanish in time: He submit∣ted to this
Proposal, and in a little time assur'd them, That it proceeded from the
Di∣rections of that Providence, to whose Service he had so strong and
glorious a Passion to de∣dicate the rest of his Life: Upon this, the
Society consented, on Condition, That he would undergo a double Noviciate,
that by the length of the Time, they might be assur'd of his be∣ing
confirm'd in those pious Resolutions.</P>
<P>THIS he accepted, and immediately sent over Powers into his own
Country, to convey and settle his Estate upon his Heir, which was
accordingly done; and the Time of his Novice∣ship being expir'd, he took his
Vows, and em∣braced that Life in which he propos'd to him∣self so much
Heavenly Satisfaction.</P>
<P>HE had not thus lived long in the Convent, but his great Capacity
and Learning, render'd him too necessary to the Service of his Order, to be
kept at home; by Command of his Su∣periors he went on several Commissions
into other Countries, where he executed the Orders, which he had receiv'd, with
wonderful Ad∣dress and Fidelity; at the same time acquiring an universal
Reputation, for his extraordinary Sanctity of Life.</P>
<P>HIS Fortune settled him, at last, in <HI>France,</HI> where he
met with the same Esteem, and Veneration, as in other Countries, being
uni∣versally caress'd, and admir'd: At last his ardent Zeal for the
Service of God, inflam'd him with a passionate Desire of laying 
<PB N="19" REF="28"/> down his Life, in asserting the Cross of Christ;
nothing wou'd now satisfy his grow∣ing Fervour, but to be sent on a
Mission, to convert Infidels to the Christian Faith, in which Employ he
had the holy Ambition to meet with a Crown of Martyrdom. This pious
In∣clination he communicated to the Superiors of his Order, but was repulsed
in his Request, being told, That Men of less Weight, than he, might be as
serviceable in the Conversion of Savages; that less Abilities, than his,
were sufficient to instruct Nations, so stupidly igno∣rant; that his
Presence was more necessary in <HI>Europe,</HI> where they had so many
Learned Ad∣versaries to combat.</P>
<P>THIS Repulse not a little mortify'd the Zeal of the good Father,
whose Passion for Martyrdom was now more inflam'd, by hearing, That there
was a new Mission of <HI>French Jesuits</HI> going over to <HI>America:</HI> He apply'd himself to the <HI>Bishop</HI> of <HI>Quebec,</HI> who was just upon his Departure for <HI>Canada</HI>; this
Prelate was so charm'd with the Zeal, and Piety of the Man, whose Character
he had heard before, that he enter'd into his Sentiments, and made use of the
Interest he had in the Court of <HI>France,</HI> to get the Request of this
New Apostle granted by Authority. Thus, Master of his Wishes, he went
over with the Bishop to <HI>Canada,</HI> where he met with as much Veneration
of his Piety, Humility, and all other Christian Vertues, in <HI>America,</HI>
as he left behind him in <HI>Europe:</HI> After some time of Refreshment,
he prepar'd <PB N="20" REF="29"/> for his Apostolical Function, and went with
his Collegues, among the most savage, and cruel Nations of the <HI>Indians:</HI> Some of his Com∣rades were murther'd by these People;
others died of the Hardships and Fatigues which they endured, while our
Missionary escap'd, thro' the Goodness of his Constitution.</P>
<P>IN this first Expedition, he was several times in imminent
Danger of Life, having once the Knife over his Head to scalp him; but
Providence, whose Secrets are unsearchable, preserv'd him, and would not
vouchsafe that Honour, which he so passionately desir'd, of dying a
Martyr: In this first Attempt, he suc∣ceeded so far, as to vanquish the
Obstinacy and Ignorance of Twenty-two <HI>Indian</HI> Men and Women, whom he
baptiz'd, and brought with him to <HI>Quebec</HI>; which Town he enter'd,
tri∣umphantly, with his Converts. The Reader may guess at the Veneration paid
him by the People, who look'd on him as a Saint and Apo∣stle, and prest
near to touch, and kiss his very Garments: The Winter Months he was oblig'd
to spend his Time at <HI>Quebec,</HI> it being impos∣sible to preserve
Life in so cold a Country, without the Cover of Houses against the
Incle∣mency of the Air: The Summer-Seasons were taken up, entirely, by the
Labours of his Mis∣sion, in which he had wonderful Success the third
Winter, at which time he approach'd the 50th Year of his Age: The Governour,
who had a profound Respect for him, invited the good Missioner to come
and reside at his House, <PB N="21" REF="30"/> with a Request to
instruct his Daughter, who desired to learn Languages, and Mathematicks:
The good Father chearfully undertook his New Province, and very
assiduously attended his young Pupil, the Pregnancy of whose Parts made
his Pains the more agreeable: This Lady was about Eighteen Years old, with a
Person equal to the Beauties of her Mind, and all the Vivacity so natural
to her Country: The Preceptor had not often attended his fair Scho∣lar, but he
found those Emotions in his Heart, which, in a little time shipwreck'd his
Ver∣tue; he fell desperately in Love, and thro' the Eyes, suck'd in that
Poyson, which now taint∣ed a Soul, that so much Vertue had long, and
constantly defended before: LOVE, that in∣vincible Tyrant, entirely
subdued, and added the Heart of this once Holy Man, to his other Triumphs: In
order to make himself the more agreeable, he cut off his Beard, and now put
on Linnen, next his Skin, which he had not worn for some Years, the more to
in∣dulge his Mortification, tho' he was not oblig'd to that Austerity by the
Rules of his Order: That Devotion, which had flam'd so long in his Heart
towards God Almighty, was now turn'd into Adoration of one of his Creatures;
LOVE converting all others Passions into itself, as the Plague does all
other Distempers.</P>
<P>IN short, he managed his Amours with that Address, That, at
last, he triumph'd, and gra∣tify'd his Criminal Desires; the Fruits of
which soon appear'd; the young Damsel was with <PB N="22" REF="31"/> Child,
which flung the Lovers into the last Confusion and Distress: There was
no Re∣medy, but one, which was, To fly; accord∣ingly one Night, the Summer now
advancing, so as to permit them to lie in the Woods, they got over the
Ramparts, and fled to the <HI>Indians,</HI> among whom he had a great
Interest, and who now receiv'd them with open Arms. As he had seen some
Campaigns in his Youth, and understood Fortification, and the Mathe∣matical
Part of War, he began to Train and Discipline the Savages, whom he
persuaded to revolt against the <HI>French:</HI> In the mean while, the
Governour, overwhelm'd with Grief for this terrible Misfortune in his Family,
sent out several small Parties to bring them back; but these were
defeated by the Superiority of Num∣bers; upon which the Governour march'd with
the whole Garrison, and all the Fighting Men he could muster; the Lovers
animated and en∣courag'd the Savages, whom they brought, in great Numbers, to
oppose the Enemy; the little Armies came in sight, and while the Two
Unfortunate Lovers stood close to one another, she, with an <HI>Indian</HI> Quiver at her Back, and Bow in her Hand, the first Fire from
the <HI>French</HI> laid them both on the Ground; Such was the sad
Catastrophe of this unhappy Man, whose Piety, and good Life, for so many
Years, could not prevent his Falling, at last, so Memorable an Example of <HI>The Imbecility of all Human Ac∣complishments.</HI></P>

<P><HI>GAMING,</HI> and <HI>Stock-jobbing,</HI> come to Day, under my

with Cold and Hunger, dress'd in <HI>Sagathie</HI> in the Depth of 
<PB N="24" REF="33"/> Winter, whom he knew to have been his Su∣perior in Wealth,

Can my Rea∣ders imagine, That <HI>Cartaerarius</HI> must not lose the

think he can be Brute enough to enjoy himself upon the Reflection of his
different Fortune, and of the Tricks he had play'd in his Life, and the <HI>Num∣bers</HI> he had made as wretched, as the <HI>Object</HI> I have

<P>THIS is a strange and melancholy <HI>Fate:</HI> a Box and Dice
heartily stamp'd upon a Table here in <HI>London,</HI> shall have a more
powerful Effect, on the Walls of a strong-built Castle in the <HI>Country,</HI> than the firing of Twenty <HI>Mor∣ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> against it could have had, on the Spot, and

Dis∣cretion,</HI> with all the Territories round about it, to one who is <HI>innocently</HI> called, a <HI>fair Enemy,</HI> and who attacks it in <HI>Play</HI> only.</P>
<P>IT is still more strange, That a Custom, which has been
known to have brought such uncom∣mon Calamities upon the greatest and
richest Men, should at last become common, among the common People
themselves: And yet this was lately the Case. Tradesmen and Sharpers of a
Lower Rank, committed the like Hosti∣lities, and Shops were shut up <HI>by
way of Gaming.</HI> I know one <HI>Wise Man</HI> an <HI>Apothecary,</HI> who
ne∣glected his <HI>Business</HI> to become <HI>Rich,</HI> and has been
seen to lose more Money by shaking his Elbow over a <HI>Gaming-Table</HI>
in three Hours, than he <PB N="25" REF="34"/> could recover by brandishing his
Arm over a <HI>Mortar</HI> in three times as many Months.</P>
<P>I AM the more slack in my Remarks, and throw together only a few
loose Hints against this vicious Habit, because a more effectual Way has
been lately taken to check its Progress. And, if People of Fashion did not
think them∣selves above the Benefit of those Laws which vulgar Persons
are cautious of transgressing, for fear of being treated as Cheats, and
Im∣postors, this Discourse would be render'd use∣less. The Nature of
Imposture, is no other∣wise alter'd, by being the Fact of a Person of
Distinction, but by its becoming more highly Criminal. Out of Persons of
Fashion and Estate, are generally chosen those, who are obliged to
watch over the publick Welfare: And can they guard Property in publick Life,
who lay Snares to entrap it in a private Capacity? No Man should be allow'd
to appear in an Assem∣bly of <HI>Business,</HI> who has made himself
a <HI>Member</HI> among the Surrounders of a <HI>Hazard Table.</HI> There have
been of late but <HI>Two</HI> Gamesters, that stepp'd high enough to have
any Rule in publick Affairs entrusted to their Management, <HI>Exlex</HI> and
the young <HI>Montanus</HI>; these, tho' otherwise Men of signal
Capacities, and many worthy Qualifications, could not resist their Natural
Propensity, and thereby infus'd into two Kingdoms such an universal
Spirit of <HI>Avarice</HI> and <HI>Gaming,</HI> by strange Schemes, 'till
then unheard-of, as must, if continued, have <PB N="26" REF="35"/> soon
accomplish'd the Ruin, which they threaten'd at their first Appearance.</P>
<P>AS to <HI>Gaming</HI> in lower Life, the Justices of the Peace
have acted with such commendable Vigilance, That they have scarce left me a
known Sharper in the Town, to exercise the Edge of my Satire upon. Most of
them have, I believe, by this time, taken to the more <HI>ho∣nourable</HI> way
of Robbing with a <HI>Pistol</HI> and <HI>Brace of Balls</HI> in it, which is
much less <HI>dangerous</HI> to the <HI>Offended,</HI> and less <HI>safe</HI> to the <HI>Offender,</HI> than a <HI>Box</HI> with a <HI>Pair
of Dice</HI> in it: Others have gone in Gangs like Foot-pads, and while one
knock'd down the Passenger, the other rifled him, which is only a kind of <HI>Emblem</HI> of their Play called <HI>Two poll One.</HI> Thus I believe,
that, if a strict Scrutiny were made into the Num∣bers that are left, of the <HI>Fraternity,</HI> we should find, that, since the happy Dissolution
of that Knot, most of the loose ones have been swept away, by his
Majesty's industrious Subject Mr. <HI>Jonathan Forward</HI> Rear-Admiral of
the <HI>City Transports.</HI></P>
<P>BUT there is a Species of more mischie∣vous <HI>Gamesters</HI>
remaining still among us, who ought, methinks, to have had free Passage
in some of that Great <HI>Pilot</HI>'s Vessels—I mean, the
present <HI>Fraternity</HI> of <HI>Stock-jobbers.</HI></P>
<P>THIS <HI>Brotherhood,</HI> who play their Game upon the Hopes and
Fears, of other People, make use of <HI>cant</HI> Names, as the <HI>Gamesters</HI> did, and with just the same Propriety. The <HI>Game∣sters</HI> called their Instruments of Mischief by the 
<PB N="27" REF="36"/> Denomination of <HI>Squibs</HI> and <HI>Puffs,</HI> and
the <HI>Stock-jobbers</HI> have their <HI>Bulls</HI> and <HI>Bears</HI>; nor
were <HI>those</HI> half so formidable in <HI>Covent-Garden,</HI> as <HI>these</HI> are about the <HI>Royal-Exchange,</HI> in <HI>Corn∣hill.</HI></P>
<P>A <HI>Bear</HI> is a Beast of Prey, who, not having perhaps a
Morsel in the World, appears with the Pretence of a whole <HI>Paw full</HI>
of <HI>Stock,</HI> which he agrees to deliver on a Day. But, if <HI>Stock</HI>
rises, he must, as the Phrase is, <HI>Shew his Tail,</HI> that is, he
must <HI>Run away.</HI></P>
<P>A <HI>Bull</HI> is just the Reverse of this: He, is as
Pennyless as his Brother Beast, but roars and bellows for <HI>Stock,</HI>
and <HI>Devours</HI> all that is offer'd him; and if, at the Time when it is to
be paid for, it happens to fall, then he too must <HI>Run off,</HI> as the <HI>Bear</HI> did.</P>
<P>NUMBERS of honest Tradesmen are delu∣ded by these <HI>odd
Beasts,</HI> and kept warm with imaginary <HI>Hopes</HI> of turning their
Money better and faster upon <HI>Stocks,</HI> than in Business: And where
the Unskilful are drawn in to try their Fortunes this way, their Money becomes
a <HI>Sa∣crifice</HI> to the <HI>Jobbers,</HI> and themselves <HI>Bankrupts</HI> to the <HI>Publick: Bulls</HI> and <HI>Bears,</HI> as
opposite as they are in their Natures, agree very well together, and
sometimes personate one another to draw in an honest Citizen; and if he
once gets between <HI>both,</HI> by that Time the <HI>Stocks,</HI> have had a
few Variations to and fro, he is sure, by their <HI>tossing</HI> him from
one to t'other, to be <HI>worried</HI> out of his Senses.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="37"/>MY Friend the <HI>Alderman,</HI> who has
some∣times a way of Jesting peculiar to himself, says, That when he has
been running over the <HI>Ad∣vertisements,</HI> relating to Bankrupts in our <HI>Ga∣zettes,</HI> he would frequently make Marks on the Margin, denoting,
Where such a <HI>broken-hearted</HI> Butcher has been forced to shut up his
Stall upon being Gored by the <HI>Horn</HI> of a <HI>Bull</HI>; and where the <HI>Paw</HI> of a <HI>Bear</HI> has pulled a rich Linnen-Draper by the Head and
Ears, over his Counter. I warrant you, my old Friend, (will he often say, for
he is apt to dwell upon old <HI>Jokes</HI>) when the Watch-Tower of <HI>Barbi∣can</HI> was standing, the sharpest Eye of any Man that stood
in it, could never perceive round this whole City, one such voracious
Ani∣mal, threatning Ruin to the Inhabitants, as the Modern <HI>Bulls</HI> and <HI>Bears</HI> are.</P>
<P>IT is certain, That the <HI>Alderman</HI>'s <HI>Jest</HI> was
true in <HI>Earnest.</HI> For our wise Ancestors made wholsome Laws for
extirpating all wild and mischievous Beasts out of the Land, and set a
Price upon their Heads. It must be therefore very wrong in such a Populous
Town as this, to permit <HI>Bulls,</HI> and unmuzzled <HI>Bears,</HI> to have
their Stalls and Dens about <HI>Exchange-Alley,</HI> where they have
Opportunity to run out and destroy unwary Citizens. Besides, the <HI>Alder∣man</HI> told me (as a Remark of his Wife,) That under Boast of the
vast <HI>Stocks</HI> they deal for, they tempt the yielding Hearts of many a
rich Citizen's Daughter, and pin themselves on Fa∣milies to be kept without a
Groat, and some∣times <PB N="29" REF="38"/> take a <HI>Bite</HI> of the young
Lady, in that Part they like best, and then run away, with∣out <HI>coming</HI> to <HI>account</HI> for it. She says, That Mr. <HI>Honeyman,</HI> a Sugar Baker, has Two Cubs upon his Daughter's hands, by a <HI>Bear</HI> that has left the <HI>Alley</HI>; and that Mr. <HI>Simple</HI>'s
Favourite Child is upon the Point of being delivered of a Calf, begot by a
silly awkward <HI>Bull,</HI> that <HI>Burst</HI> himself, by <HI>swallowing Stock,</HI> beyond the Power of his natural <HI>Digestion.</HI></P>
<P>THESE are Things not to be tolerated in any Civil Government
whatsoever; for they manifestly tend to the Ruin of Commerce; and at this
rate it will come to pass in the course of a few Years, That while <HI>Russia</HI> is polishing its rough Inhabitants into the finer
Resemblance of <HI>Englishmen,</HI> the Politeness of <HI>Britain</HI>
will be transformed into the Barbarity of <HI>Russia,</HI> and the
greatest Part of this Metropolis will be over∣run with an unheard-of
Generation of <HI>Savages</HI> and <HI>Monsters.</HI> It is, therefore, my
serious Opi∣nion, That the Practice shou'd be put down; and that for the
Quiet and Safety of <HI>sober Citizens,</HI> every <HI>Bull</HI> and <HI>Bear</HI> of them all, should be first driven out of the City, by the
way of <HI>Newgate,</HI> and then transported out of the Kingdom.</P>

<P>THE LOVE of our <HI>Country,</HI> when it is understood, as
Great Spirits consider <HI>it,</HI> is the most <HI>Noble,</HI> among
those <HI>Vertues,</HI> which grace and elevate Human Nature: But, in the <HI>General Idea,</HI> which Men form, when they speak of this publick <HI>Duty,</HI> it is a mean, and selfish <HI>Frailty!</HI> A poor
Contraction of Soul, which would call in our Beneficence from Mankind, our
common Brotherhood! and con∣fine it, with a scandalous Frugality of
Affecti∣on, to the <HI>Land</HI> which we were <HI>born</HI> in; for the same
ridiculous Reason, which made the <HI>Ape,</HI> in the <HI>Fable,</HI> the <HI>First,</HI> that produced her young Ones, when a Decree had been
publish∣ed, That the most <HI>Beautiful,</HI> among the <HI>Beasts,</HI>
should succeed to the <HI>Government.</HI></P>
<P>FEW Men, I am afraid, have <HI>any</HI> Nobler Motive, than this <HI>Love</HI> of themselves, for the <HI>Love,</HI> they bear their <HI>Country!</HI> But the Partia∣lity of a true Patriot must be justify'd
by his <PB N="31" REF="40"/> Care of the Publick Honour: He must contri∣bute
to the General Interest, with the Loss of his particular <HI>Ease,</HI>
and to the Hazard of his private <HI>Safety.</HI> The same impatient <HI>Beat,</HI> with which the Soul, conscious of Immortality, presses
forward to Futurity, and inspires a Se∣cret Pleasure in our Hope of Fame <HI>Hereafter,</HI> tho' we are sure we shall be <HI>Dust,</HI> and have
no Ear for those Praises, which we charm our our selves in <HI>Death,</HI> with but the Prospect, and faint Image of:—The same
Noble Source has the Spirit of true <HI>Patriotism!</HI>—It teaches a
wise Man to <HI>Love</HI> his <HI>Country, Like</HI> his Off-spring; not
meerly, as they are <HI>His</HI>; but for the Natural Vertues, which he
observes in them, and which he has taken Delight to to cherish, and urge
forward, for the Orna∣ment of Posterity.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Prejudices</HI> of our <HI>Minds,</HI> and the dif∣ferent <HI>Interests</HI> we are led by, make us very unqualified Judges, of the
State of this Vertue, with Regard to the Times, we live in: And the same
Passions have always produc'd the same Effects, in the <HI>Historians,</HI> of former Ages: But there are some Instances, so
strongly De∣monstrative, in their Nature, That <HI>Partiality</HI> can add
no <HI>Beauty,</HI> by the Arts of Describing; nor can <HI>Envy</HI>
discolour them, by false Lights, or misplacing.</P>
<P>DEEP Enquirers into Nature have recom∣mended it, as a way to judge
soundly of Mens good, or evil Tendency, by observing what Effect is
produc'd in their Passions, upon Re∣lation <PB N="32" REF="41"/> of some
Amiable Example, of Human Excellence; if such a Trial is just, I should
wish to avoid the Society of that Man, who could reflect on the following
Story, without unusual Emotions, in Honour of the <HI>Noble Roman,</HI> to
whose <HI>true</HI> Sense of Publick Spirit, we owe it.</P>
<P>IN that part of the <HI>Punick</HI> War, when <HI>Fa∣bius
Maximus</HI> commanded the Forces of <HI>Italy,</HI> against <HI>Hannibal,</HI> certain Officers of the <HI>Roman</HI> Army, were taken
Prisoners by the Enemy. <HI>Fabius</HI> was well acquainted with the Skill
and Courage of these Men, and resolv'd not to lose them: He, therefore,
treated with the <HI>Car∣thaginians,</HI> and agreed upon their Ransom, at a
very high Sum. for Payment of which, by a Day appointed, he engag'd the Honour
of the <HI>Roman Senate:</HI> But the <HI>Senate,</HI> instead of sending
him the Money, refused to ratify the Agreement.—<HI>Fabius</HI>
receiv'd the News, with more <HI>Grief,</HI> than <HI>Indignation</HI>; and,
giving strict Orders, for concealing it from his Army, dispatch'd his Son
to <HI>Rome,</HI> with all Secrecy and Expedition, to make Sale of his <HI>Own
Paternal Estate,</HI> and to return to him with the <HI>Money</HI>; which as
soon he receiv'd, he sent it to <HI>Hannibal,</HI> as from the <HI>Senate,</HI>—<HI>For I had rather,</HI> said he, <HI>It should be
reported of the</HI> Ro∣mans, <HI>That they have a</HI> General <HI>without</HI> Land, <HI>than a</HI> Senate <HI>without</HI> Humanity?</P>
<P>OUR <HI>Clergyman,</HI> whom we delight to con∣sider, as a <HI>Blessing</HI> to the <HI>Assembly,</HI> because his <HI>Life</HI>
is a silent Enforcer of his <HI>Doctrine,</HI> was <PB N="33" REF="42"/>
expatiating, the other Day, on the <HI>Grace,</HI> and <HI>Grandeur,</HI> of
this <HI>Action</HI>; and had fix'd us, in the most satisfied, and
respectful Attention; when he was broke in upon, by the <HI>Coquet,</HI> with
the following Relation, which she assur'd us, was Matter of Fact, and
happen'd very lately;—<HI>And it contains,</HI> added she, <HI>so
ex∣alted an Instance of refin'd, and generous</HI> Love, <HI>That if ever I
find a Man, who would be</HI> Mine <HI>upon such Terms, I shall</HI> Marry, <HI>and bid Defiance to the Sound of the Word</HI> Matron!</P>
<P><HI>COURTHOPE</HI> was the Son of an <HI>English</HI> Merchant,
who had liv'd long in the <HI>Canary Islands</HI>; he had been sent young
to <HI>London,</HI> for the Advantage of his Education, and (while there) fell
in <HI>Love</HI> with <HI>Bellaria,</HI> the only Daughter of a Gentleman of a
good Family and Estate, who had promis'd this Lady to a distant Relation,
of his Name: But she had an Aversion for his Person, and made open
Profession of a Passion for young <HI>Courthope,</HI> which the Father
was so far from approving, that, being provok'd by her Firmness, he
command∣ed her, under Penalty of his Hatred, and his Curse, never more to
converse with him; and confin'd her, from that time forward, to pre∣vent even
the Possibility of it. <HI>Bellaria,</HI> not∣withstanding this
Restraint, found means to escape, and dressing her self in Boy's
Cloaths, imbark'd with <HI>Courthope,</HI> on a <HI>Spanish</HI> Ship, that
was bound for the <HI>Canaries</HI>; where he assur'd her, they would be
welcome to a <HI>Fa∣ther,</HI> whose gentle Nature knew nothing of 
<PB N="34" REF="43"/> that <HI>Rigour,</HI> which, from her Infancy, she had
been oppress'd by. They were taken in this Voyage, by a <HI>Moorish</HI>
Vessel, belonging to the Rovers of <HI>Sallee:</HI> And 'tis easier to
conceive, than express, the Affliction, the Despair, the Astonishment
of <HI>Courthope:</HI> fallen, at once, from a Prospect of the sweetest,
and most live∣ly Joy, to the Depth of consummate Misery! He saw <HI>Her,</HI> now, the Companion of his <HI>Sla∣very,</HI> who had wish'd,
and ventur'd, so much, to make <HI>Him</HI> Partner of her <HI>Affluence</HI>; and he suffer'd more than Death, every time, that his
Eyes, all swimming in Tears, stole a Glance, at his <HI>Bellaria,</HI> whom
he durst not distinguish, by any Marks of Respect, or Service, for fear
of pointing out her <HI>Sex,</HI> to the Brutes, who were their Masters.</P>
<P>BUT what aggravated his Sorrow, to the most piercing Extremity,
was, an Information he receiv'd from a Native of the <HI>Canaries,</HI> whom he
found a Slave at <HI>Sallee,</HI> That his Fa∣ther was newly dead, and that all
his Effects had been seiz'd by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> on Occasion of
some Criminal Correspondencies, which he had unwarily been drawn into.</P>
<P>THEY pass'd about a Week, with the rest of their Ship's
Company, in a publick Dun∣geon of the City, where they were to expect the
killing Summons, which must expose them in a <HI>Market,</HI> to be sold,
and torn for ever from the Enjoyment of that mutual Comfort, which was, now,
the only Thought, that could sup∣port 'em in their Wretchedness. The Moon, 
<PB N="35" REF="44"/> one Night, shone clearly thro' the Grates of the
Prison Windows; and <HI>Courthope,</HI> while the rest were asleep, hung,
in melancholy Trans∣port, over the Bosom of <HI>Bellaria,</HI> who
started, in broken Slumbers, and fill'd his Soul with sad Reflections. He
took Notice of a rugged Stone, which rose, pointed, thro' the Earth, and
imagining it might hurt her, remov'd it, with much Difficulty, and had no
sooner drawn it out, but he discover'd an old Piece of Wool∣len Cloth,
which had formerly been hidden under it, in which were Sixty <HI>Moidores,</HI>
Two <HI>Gold Rings,</HI> and a <HI>Writing</HI> which he perceiv'd to have been <HI>French,</HI> but now defac'd, and not legible,</P>
<P>HE approach'd <HI>Bellaria</HI>'s Ear, and awak'd her, in all the
Ecstacy of a Man, who consider'd himself, as distinguished by <HI>Providence:</HI> He whisper'd his new Hopes, of an immediate Redemption;
and found Means soon after, by Aid of an honest <HI>Jew,</HI> a Man of much
Charity, who visited the Slaves every Morning, to be carried to the <HI>Alcaid</HI>; and, trusting his Gold with the <HI>Jew,</HI> propos'd to
ransom <HI>Himself</HI> and <HI>Bellaria,</HI> whom he called his Brother:
But the Conflict of his Passions had so visible an Effect, in his
Looks, and his Earnestness, that the <HI>Alcaid</HI> took Advantage, from
what he observed, and insisted on the whole Sum, for the Liberty, of <HI>One</HI> only, which was offered him, for <HI>Both.</HI>—He bid him
name, at his Choice, either his Brother, or himself; but advised him to
lose no Time, for an <HI>English</HI> Sloop was ready <PB N="36" REF="45"/>
to sail out of the Harbour, with ransom'd Captives on Board, and would
carry him to <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> where his Countrymen were in
Gar∣rison:—He added too, That all the <HI>Chri∣stian Slaves</HI> in <HI>Sallee,</HI> were to set out the next Morning, for <HI>Mequinez,</HI> to
work on some New Buildings of the Emperor of <HI>Morocco.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Courthope</HI> trembled with Jealousy; and a Thousand
different Fears, at the distracting Imagination of <HI>Bellaria,</HI> in the
Eye and Power of such a Tyrant!—He went out with the <HI>Jew,</HI> and
took a sudden Resolution.</P>
<P>ABOUT Noon the same Day, the <HI>Jew</HI> re∣turned to the
Prison, and carried with him an Order for the Dismission of <HI>Bellaria</HI>; who, en∣quiring after <HI>Courthope,</HI> was told, He went
be∣fore, to prepare Things for her Reception, on Board the Vessel, they
were to embark in; and had given him Orders to conduct her thither immediately.
Never was any Order obey'd with so much Transport; the <HI>Jew</HI> hir'd a
Boat, and attending her to the Ship, return'd, abrupt∣ly, to the Town, without
taking Leave of her:—She was led into the Cabbin, where, ex∣pecting to
find her Lover, she was receiv'd by the Master of the Vessel, with whom
the <HI>Jew</HI> had been before, and who deliver'd her a Let∣ter, which she
open'd, with trembling Hands, and read in it, what follows.</P>
<LETTER>
<P>HOW miserable should I have been, my <HI>dear,</HI> my <HI>lost Bellaria!</HI> if Heaven had not enabled me to redeem <HI>you</HI>

<P>SHE flew, skrieking, upon the Deck, as soon as she had read

<P>THOUGH <HI>Good-Breeding</HI> and <HI>Politeness,</HI> are
generally thought the <HI>same,</HI> they are <HI>Qualities</HI> very <HI>different. Politeness</HI> is the <HI>In∣fluence</HI> of a <HI>Natural

Civility.</HI> The <HI>Last</HI> but <HI>Restrains</HI> us from <HI>giving
Offence;</HI> the <HI>First, Impowers</HI> us to <HI>give Pleasure.
Politeness</HI> is the happy Mixture of <HI>Greatness,</HI> with <HI>Benignity:</HI> 'Tis a <HI>Sun-shine</HI> from the <HI>Soul,</HI> on the <HI>Looks, Words</HI> and <HI>Actions. Good-Breeding</HI> is often, a <HI>Surface</HI> without <HI>Depth</HI>; and, like the Painter's gay Colours,
on dark Primings, spreads a <HI>Gloss</HI> over the <HI>Outside,</HI>
even of <HI>Vices,</HI> and <HI>Mean∣spiritedness:</HI> Whereas <HI>Politeness,</HI> like the <HI>Cry∣stal,</HI> is <HI>transparent</HI>

<OPENER>
<SALUTE>Mr. <HI>Plain-Dealer:</HI> SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ALL Yours, yet publish'd, have regular∣ly receiv'd, and note
their Contents. I thought it proper to let you know, That al∣though I am a <HI>Cooper,</HI> I lov'd her as well as her <HI>finical Turkey-Merchant.</HI>
But I forgot to let you know, first, That the needful of this Letter is, That
she, that I mean, is a pretty, young Woman, worth a Brace and a half of <HI>Thousands.</HI> But that makes nothing to the Story: I had <HI>Money
enough,</HI> for that Matter; and tho' I was no powder'd <HI>fine Fellow,</HI>
with a finical white Wig, yet I valued and esteemed her, as if I had been the
Mother that bore her: And I should have been glad, when Heaven saw fit, to
have had her in <PB N="40" REF="49"/> her <HI>Smock!</HI> And so, <HI>mayhap,</HI> now I think on't, wou'd her Beau too; but I mean in an <HI>honest way</HI> only. But what matters that? <HI>Fair and False</HI>
was an old Saying in its Time! And if I had stuck close to my Calling, and
valued her no more than the Paring of my Nails, I had been a better Man for it,
by some <HI>Hundreds.</HI> But there is no setting <HI>Old Heads</HI> upon <HI>Young Shoulders.</HI> Every Body knows, I am no <HI>Bragster</HI>; and,
tho' I say it, that should not, I could have lov'd the very Ground that
she <HI>went</HI> upon: And very un∣happy she has made me, that's certain;
where∣by, I hope, somebody that is higher than she, will remember her for
it, in the <HI>Last Day,</HI> for then all <HI>Secrets</HI> will be <HI>laid
open.</HI> I can't, for my Life, imagine, what possesses me, but I
shall begin to hate <HI>my own-self</HI> shortly, if it was, in Nature,
to be possible, because, when∣ever she comes into my Head, I am ready
to <HI>cry</HI> at the Thoughts of her.</P>
<P>NOW you must know, she had told a Friend of mine, that <HI>wish'd</HI> me to her, not once, nor twice, but that very Day, that he
was leading her Home from <HI>Draper</HI>'s <HI>Gardens,</HI> That she
thought, as how no Man could fall in Love with a <HI>Red-Hair'd Woman.</HI>
But, to see how strangely Mistakes will come about! this was all but her
own Fancy; for I never once thought of it; nor was never the Man, that had ever
concern'd my self, with any Thing she had about her. So, because I
woud'n't be <HI>uncivil,</HI> I made a great Supper, <PB N="41" REF="50"/> and
invited an old Aunt of mine, that she <HI>know'd,</HI> and half a score
young Women, be∣sides herself, to take Part of it: for it <HI>burnt</HI> in
my Mind, strangely. In the middle of the Supper, I watch'd my Time, to drink
to her; and told her, before 'em all, That she might be sure, by my having
no Body to Supper, but <HI>Folks with Red Hair,</HI> as how I shou'dn't like
her a <HI>Crum</HI> the worse, for <HI>That:</HI> For I didn't care a Pin,
for that mat∣ter, if she was as <HI>red</HI> as a <HI>Fox,</HI> all over. To
be sure, she look'd, all Night, after it, as the <HI>Devil lookt over
Lincoln:</HI> And when I went, the Afternoon after, to <HI>make Love</HI> to
her, as I us'd to do, nothing vex'd me, but her sending me down word, by that
pert Gossip, Mrs. <HI>Briget,</HI> (that, I am sure, has had of me, at
Times, in Presents, besides Good Words, to the Value of <HI>Five
Pieces!</HI>) and yet, she bid <HI>Her, forsooth,</HI> to go and tell me,
That I had no need for giving my self any more Trouble to come there; for her
Mistress would have nothing to say to a <HI>Hoop-driver.</HI></P>
<P>NOW I, knowing, as how we are com∣manded to <HI>forgive</HI> all
our <HI>Enemies,</HI> wou'dn't do her <HI>no Harm,</HI> for the World: And
so, hoping you will print this, <HI>only</HI> to <HI>expose</HI> her,

<OPENER>
<SALUTE>Dear Drybones!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WITH all <HI>due</HI> Respect to the <HI>Dignity</HI> of
Woollen Night-caps, what has urg'd thee, to profess such a <HI>Spleen</HI>
against <HI>Mas∣querading?</HI> when nothing less than a <HI>Mask,</HI>
can make thee <HI>fit</HI> to keep Company. It was just such a Vinegar
Visage as thine, appear∣ing abroad, <HI>uncover'd</HI> to the terrifying of
whole Parishes, that made <HI>Impudence</HI> be call'd <HI>barefac'd.</HI>
Thy <HI>Oaken-stick</HI> is a <HI>Type</HI> of Thee; only not half so <HI>dry,</HI> nor so <HI>tough,</HI> nor so <HI>crabbed.</HI></P>
<P>'TIS well, you have taken up your Lodg∣ings in a <HI>Watch-Tower.</HI> If I knew how to come at you, you shou'd have a <HI>Feeling</HI> of my Respect, for your Parts and your PLAIN
DEALING.—Yet you are in the Right too, in <HI>one</HI> Thing, that
relates to your <HI>Paper</HI>; which is, your Publishing it on <HI>Fridays:</HI> For <HI>Fish-Days,</HI> and <HI>Fasts,</HI> prepare
People for Mortification.</P>
<P>IF you needs must be <HI>Preaching,</HI> are there not
Subjects enow to <HI>cant</HI> on, without quarrelling with one <HI>pleasant</HI> Night or two <PB N="43" REF="52"/> in a Moon? Which gets
so many <HI>honest Peo∣ple</HI> a comfortable Livelihood too! and which
accommodates <HI>sober</HI> Gentlemen, and Ladies, with so <HI>decent</HI>
an Opportunity, to <HI>converse,</HI> without Censure! <HI>Why,</HI>
since you <HI>must rail,</HI> don't you rail, like a <HI>Good Subject,</HI>
at the <HI>in∣convenient</HI> Presumption, of late so much in Fashion, of <HI>Making bold with our Betters?</HI> Egad! if I was <HI>Somebody,</HI> Nobody
should dare to <HI>Deal Plainly.</HI></P>
<P>IT is a <HI>Sign</HI> you are an <HI>Old Fellow,</HI> since
you can't meddle with the <HI>Ladies,</HI> without <HI>nettling</HI> 'em! If
this is your Manner of <HI>hand∣ling</HI> us Women, which you had the
Confi∣dence to threaten, at your first setting out, a Fig for all you can
do to us.—You cou'd never want <HI>Subjects,</HI> if you did not want
Brains, without abusing <HI>Pleasures,</HI> you are <HI>past</HI> the
Enjoyment of:—There's the <HI>Fool,</HI> and the <HI>Wise</HI>; and the <HI>Statesmen,</HI> and the <HI>fine Gentleman,</HI> Scope enough for
Variety!—Let alone but the <HI>Masquerades,</HI> and use the <HI>World,</HI> at your Pleasure.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Fool</HI> will be, readily allow'd, to the PLAIN DEALER.
But many, indeed, may wonder, what the <HI>Wise</HI> can have to do with your <HI>Paper.</HI>—Why, they see the Rest in the wrong, and <HI>laugh</HI> where they shou'd <HI>remedy:</HI> Their <HI>Ill-nature,</HI>
therefore, stands in need of a <HI>Snarler.</HI>—The <HI>Statesman,</HI> you know, is by Prescription, and the <HI>Happiness</HI> of our <HI>Constitution,</HI> the <HI>Right</HI> of the <HI>Scrib∣bler!</HI> And, as for the <HI>fine Gentlemen,</HI> (I 
<PB N="44" REF="53"/> mean those of the newest Edition, all <HI>gilt</HI>
down the <HI>Back,</HI> and <HI>tightly bound,</HI> in <HI>Calf's
Leather</HI>); they are a Race of <HI>breathing Blanks,</HI> fast asleep,
with Eyes broad open! Yet, if you were good for any Thing, but to <HI>spoil
Trade,</HI> you might <HI>wake</HI> 'em, by a Pinch or two, of <HI>Plain-Dealing,</HI> into an Ap∣prehension of this Truth, which they never
so much as <HI>dream't</HI> of,—<HI>That the Dead may as well be call'd
Members of a State, as they who Live to no Purpose.</HI></P>
<P>SEE, now, <HI>Goodman Sowersop!</HI> Here is Business
enough cut out for you.—Let the <HI>Women</HI> alone; and concern

<HEAD TYPE="sub"><DATE>MONDAY, <HI>April</HI> 13. 1724.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>BEING the other Day in a large Com∣pany at a Gentleman's House
in <HI>Covent-Garden,</HI> I was highly delighted, to hear a young beautiful <HI>Lady</HI> acknowledge that Tears flow'd from her Eyes, upon reading of the
Story of <HI>Courthope.</HI> She who had the <HI>Virtue</HI> to be so <HI>Elegantly moved</HI> by his <HI>Distress,</HI> will relish an Account
of his better Fortune, which she may hereafter expect to be <HI>Entertained</HI> with. But when she added, <HI>That she had been a</HI>
Coquette <HI>too long, and if ever it should be her Fate to meet with a
Suitor of</HI> Courthope<HI>'s</HI> Desert, <HI>she would let him</HI>
lose <HI>no Time, for Fear of Accidents:</HI> when I perceived she made
this <HI>frank</HI> Confession, not only with her <HI>Lips,</HI> but from
her <HI>Heart,</HI> I confess, I began to conceive Hopes of knowing very
speedily, <HI>That some</HI> visible Fruits <HI>would arise from
these my</HI> Labours.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="55"/>I WAS therefore a little concern'd, when I
found my self interrupted by a young <HI>Wag,</HI> who was pleased to
pass Pertness upon the Company for <HI>Jesting.</HI> 
<Q REND="inline">'That PLAIN DEALER, <HI>said he,</HI> is <HI>a
well-meaning Writer,</HI> but he does not strike out a Meaning <HI>cleverly.</HI> This is one of the best Stories I have read, upon the
Subject of <HI>Love</HI>; only, there is not one <HI>Double-Meaning</HI>
through the Whole, and that makes it <HI>Insipid.</HI> He has been <HI>generally</HI> hitherto, a perfect Inhabitant of his <HI>Blunt-Hall,</HI>
which seems to be, rather the <HI>Seat</HI> of his <HI>Understanding</HI>
than of his <HI>Person.</HI> But, since the <HI>Ladies like</HI> him, I
will endeavour to be of <HI>Their</HI> Mind, and especially be∣cause he
tells us, he is an <HI>Old Batchelor,</HI> as well as a PLAIN DEALER, and we
must have some <HI>Humour</HI> struck <HI>out of</HI> him, when he comes
to <HI>act</HI> that Character.</Q></P>
<P>I GUESS'D what the young <HI>Malapert</HI> would be at by the Word <HI>Humour,</HI> and I found I was not deceiv'd, when he pulled out of his
Pocket a little Scrap of Poetry, intitled,—<HI>An Epistle from
Mrs.</HI> Robinson <HI>to</HI> Senesino,—in which he peremptorily
swore, <HI>There was a great deal of</HI> Turn, Life, <HI>and</HI>
Spirit.</P>
<P>IT is certain, He shewed some <HI>Spirit</HI> in reading it,
and proved himself a <HI>Master</HI> of <HI>Hu∣mour,</HI> for he went <HI>boldly</HI> and <HI>undauntedly</HI> thro' it; and would never observe,
that every <HI>fresh Line</HI> excited <HI>fresh Blushes</HI> in the <HI>Faces</HI> of all the <HI>Fair</HI> and <HI>Modest</HI> Part of the
Assembly.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="56"/>I TAKE this <HI>Opportunity</HI> of Informing
that young Spark (and all others of the same <HI>Class</HI> are desired
to take <HI>Notice</HI> of it) That he is greatly mistaken, if he expects any
such Hu∣mour from me, notwithstanding his <HI>irreverent</HI> way of
talking of his <HI>Elders,</HI> and throwing, over <HI>my</HI> Shoulder, a
General Sneer upon all the <HI>Old Batchelors</HI> in <HI>Great-Britain.</HI></P>
<P>MY <HI>Province</HI> must be <HI>Tedious,</HI> before it can
grow <HI>Pleasant</HI>; I must first remove <HI>Folly,</HI> before I can
make Room for <HI>Wit</HI>; for it is by <HI>clear∣ing</HI> their way through
the Rubbish of <HI>Ab∣surdity,</HI> that Men take the <HI>first
Steps</HI> to <HI>Wis∣dom.</HI></P>
<P>IF, according to the <HI>Maxim</HI> in the Forehead of my <HI>Paper,</HI> it was my immediate Office to <HI>Teach</HI> that young Spark <HI>better</HI> Things, which I had then a great Inclination to <HI>Do,</HI>
only for Fear of <HI>discovering</HI> my self, I would begin by <HI>Weeding</HI> out of his Mind that <HI>rank</HI> Conceit, which he
entertains of his Parts, and shewing him, that there is no <HI>true
Humour</HI> in <HI>Lewdness,</HI> nor <HI>true Wit</HI> in a <HI>Double
Entendre.</HI></P>
<P>HOW <HI>different</HI> was the <HI>Principle</HI> of <HI>Waller?</HI> That Excellent Writer, as I have heard my old Friend Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> relate publickly at <HI>Will</HI>'s, in his Commendation,
used to say, <HI>That he would</HI> raze <HI>any</HI> Line <HI>out of
his</HI> Poems, <HI>which did not</HI> imply <HI>some</HI> Motive <HI>to</HI>
Virtue. This is a Saying that ought to be <HI>Memorable</HI> among our <HI>Poets</HI>; it carries with it the <HI>Energy</HI> of <HI>Good
Sense,</HI> as well as <HI>Virtue.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="57"/>FOR my own Share, I declare, I would rather <HI>Propagate</HI> one such <HI>Maxim,</HI> with good Effect, amongst the
Writers of the present Age, than be the <HI>Head</HI> of those <HI>Writers</HI> my∣self, and the Author of <HI>better</HI> Verses, than <HI>Waller</HI>'s.</P>
<P>THEY who believe this to be my real Sen∣timent, may guess how
extreamly delighted I must have been, with the following <HI>Answer,</HI>
which a young Lady has given, to the <HI>Affront</HI> and <HI>Outrage</HI>
offered to the whole <HI>Sex,</HI> by one who personates <HI>Senesino,</HI>

<P>THE <HI>Business</HI> of the <HI>following,</HI> is of a <HI>Nature</HI> very <HI>surprizing.</HI> To say <HI>Truth,</HI> I was
startled at it. It does not, <HI>directly,</HI> indeed, come to me from the <HI>Devil:</HI> But it was sent me from a <HI>Deputy</HI> of <HI>his,</HI>
who Professes the <HI>Black Art,</HI> and stiles himself <HI>Doctor
Faustus.</HI> He dates his Letter, <HI>From the</HI> Theatre <HI>in</HI>
Lincolns-Inn-Fields,—and would <HI>pass</HI> upon me, for a <HI>Player,</HI> or a <HI>Tumbler,</HI> or <HI>Zany,</HI> under the <HI>Disguise</HI> of a Magician: But I beg his Pardon for <HI>That</HI>; I
am seldom <HI>deceiv'd</HI> so easily. I am almost persuaded, It is
an <HI>Agile,</HI> Evil Spirit, <PB N="50" REF="59"/> that walks and does
Mischief, by Candle-Light, and assumes <HI>enticing Shapes,</HI> to draw
in the <HI>Unwary,</HI> and deprive People of their <HI>Wits.</HI> But, if he
be, <HI>really,</HI> Flesh and Blood, I am at a Loss what to think of him;
only his <HI>Assurance</HI> seems considerable, (since he appears, by
his Letter, to belong to One of our <HI>Theatres</HI>) that he should imagine
me to be Novice enough to believe, he could be a <HI>Conjurer.</HI></P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD><HI>FAUSTUS,</HI> the <HI>MAGICIAN,</HI> To the <HI>PLAIN

<P>FORASMUCH as I Reverence your Name and your Purpose, I decline
the Revenge, which, by Aid of my <HI>Art,</HI> I might return for my Injuries;
and content my self, by your Means, to expose an <HI>Impostor.</HI></P>
<P>HAVING fixed my Place of Residence, on my Arrival in this
famous City, at the <HI>Theatre</HI> by <HI>Lincoln</HI>'s-<HI>Inn,</HI> for
the <HI>Publick Dis∣play</HI> of <HI>Qualities</HI> which <HI>Distinguish</HI> the Sons of <HI>Magick</HI>; I heard, with a Due
Mixture of <HI>Contempt</HI> and <HI>Displeasure,</HI> that the Rumour of
my Purpose had encourag'd <HI>another Theatre</HI> to <HI>disguise</HI>
under the <HI>Venerable</HI> Character of <HI>Faustus,</HI> a profess'd
Lover of <HI>Levity</HI>; and <HI>endeavour,</HI> in Spite of Nature, to give
him the <HI>Weight</HI> of a <HI>Wizard.</HI></P>
<P>BUT, being satisfied in the <HI>Consciousness</HI> of my <HI>own</HI> Superiority, I have <HI>overlook'd</HI> and <HI>neglected</HI>
him; 'till, embolden'd by <HI>Success,</HI> he has <HI>dar'd,</HI> now, at
last, to <HI>publish</HI> his <HI>List</HI> <PB N="51" REF="60"/> of <HI>Fooleries</HI>; with a pertinacious <HI>Pretence</HI> to something not
unlike <HI>Comparison!</HI> I am therefore determin'd, immediately, to make
him <HI>leap</HI> out of my Gown, and confess him∣self <HI>No
Doctor.</HI></P>
<P>IN that Catalogue of <HI>Tricks,</HI> (most illiberal
Appellation!) he makes use of these <HI>strange</HI>
Words—<HI>A</HI> Usurer <HI>comes in, and brings a Money-Bag to
the</HI> Doctor; <HI>for which he offers his Note; but the</HI> Usurer <HI>entirely con∣temns the Proposal, and will have the</HI> Doctor'<HI>s</HI>
Leg, <HI>instead of Security for the Money. The</HI> Doctor <HI>endeavours to
dissuade him from this Demand, and offers him his Head, in Exchange of
the</HI> Leg <HI>he wanted.</HI></P>
<P>I PASS over the <HI>unmagical Absurdity</HI> of a <HI>Necromancer</HI>'s wanting Money; or, That a <HI>Usurer,</HI> who would
rather have parted with his <HI>own</HI> Leg, to save a Bag of Money,
should be so whimsical to surrender <HI>it,</HI> in Exchange for <HI>Another</HI>'s. I leave such <HI>Remarks</HI> to the <HI>Trite</HI>
Essays of <HI>Criticks,</HI> not descending, my self, to the <HI>Insignificance</HI> of being <HI>Witty:</HI> But what I would convey to
the Knowledge of your <HI>Readers,</HI> is, The <HI>Necessity</HI> which my <HI>Charms</HI> have laid this <HI>Boaster</HI> under, to <HI>Ex∣pose</HI>
and <HI>Discover</HI> himself, in the very <HI>Act</HI> of his <HI>Imposture.</HI></P>
<P>FOR who does not know, That had he been the <HI>true
Faustus,</HI> his <HI>Brains</HI> must have had their Situation in his <HI>Head?</HI> His <HI>Head</HI> therefore, he would have preferr'd to all his <HI>inferior</HI> Members. But the <HI>Seat</HI> of his Un∣derstanding 
<PB N="52" REF="61"/> having been <HI>plac'd,</HI> by his <HI>Pro∣fession,</HI> at the <HI>Bottom</HI> of his Body, I
com∣mission'd a <HI>Familiar</HI> to perplex his Appre∣hension; who, by
convincing him of how little Worth his <HI>Head</HI> was, in comparison with
his <HI>Heels,</HI> drew him under such a Terror, that he continually cries
out, to those who come for his Catalogue, <HI>The</HI> Devil <HI>is, in good

<P>THERE is a <HI>Liveliness,</HI> and Race of <HI>Spirit,</HI>
which we commonly call <HI>Wit</HI>; but it is the <HI>Effect</HI> of <HI>Natural Accident</HI>; and depends, like a <HI>Machine,</HI> upon <HI>Order</HI> and <PB N="53" REF="62"/> <HI>Parts.</HI> It is only the <HI>Result</HI> of a <HI>Mixture</HI> of <HI>different Humours:</HI> and of
Animal Spirits, <HI>finer</HI> and more <HI>delicately</HI> agitated, than
ordi∣nary; which <HI>imprint</HI> in their Passage, a <HI>quick</HI> and <HI>lively</HI> Sense of Images; and animate by that Impression, the <HI>Visage, Voice,</HI> and <HI>Deport∣ment.</HI></P>
<P>IT is merely by this Quickness, and Heat of their <HI>Imagination,</HI> that witty Men surprize us. A smart and sprightly <HI>Rhetorick!</HI> A hu∣morous Turn of <HI>Phrase!</HI> A frank Vivacity of <HI>Mien!</HI> with a <HI>modish Affectation</HI> of peculiar <HI>Looks,</HI>
and <HI>Gesture,</HI> make the <HI>Merit</HI> of their <HI>Character.</HI>
But these Men want, for the most Part, both <HI>Strength</HI> of <HI>Mind,</HI> and <HI>Penetration.</HI> Their <HI>Imaginations</HI> are <HI>thin,</HI> and <HI>delicate</HI>; and play <HI>lightly</HI> on the <HI>Skirts</HI> of <HI>Objects:</HI> But they are too <HI>weak</HI> for solid <HI>Reasoning</HI>; and, in any Thing <HI>abstracted,</HI> and <HI>above</HI> the <HI>Pitch</HI> of the <HI>Senses,</HI> they are
miserably <HI>Impotent,</HI> and grow presently <HI>weary.</HI></P>
<P>THEY are the <HI>Ladies Favourites,</HI> however; by a Kind of <HI>Sympathy,</HI> or <HI>Resemblance:</HI> For, <HI>Women,</HI> being

Consistence; with <HI>Fibres fine,</HI> and <HI>slender; apt</HI> and <HI>easy</HI> to be mov'd, by the <HI>weakest</HI> Agitations. They are <HI>subject</HI> therefore, to their <HI>Senses</HI>; and wanting <HI>Force,</HI> to strike <HI>deeper,</HI> set up for Judges of <HI>Modes,</HI> and <HI>Fashions</HI>; and relish nothing, but what
contributes to their <HI>Pleasure,</HI> or their <HI>Ornament.</HI> They have
fix'd the Standard of <HI>Wit,</HI> by certain <HI>Rules</HI> of this <HI>Tendency</HI>; and <PB N="54" REF="63"/> find nothing so <HI>difficult,</HI> as to believe a Man can <HI>want</HI> it, who has such <HI>Charms</HI> for <HI>their</HI> Entertainment.</P>
<P>NED VOLATILE, a Member of our <HI>Assem∣bly</HI> at the <HI>Widow</HI>'s, is a <HI>Foreman</HI> of this <HI>Species.</HI> With a great
Extent of <HI>Good Nature,</HI> he ap∣pears <HI>Void</HI> of <HI>any</HI>; his
Facility to <HI>jest</HI> and <HI>rally,</HI> transports him, beyond <HI>Decency,</HI> to <HI>illustrate</HI> Objects, or <HI>debase</HI> 'em;
and, without regard to <HI>Ceremony, Merit,</HI> or <HI>Condition,</HI> he <HI>contracts</HI> Things, or <HI>magnifies</HI> them, when they fall in his
Way, 'till he has <HI>adapted</HI> them to his <HI>Talent,</HI> of presenting
every Thing <HI>ridiculously.</HI></P>
<P>WE have the very <HI>Reverse</HI> of this <HI>Character,</HI> in

Sol∣dier; and offers Arguments, in Excuse for the <HI>Rashness</HI> of
his Ruiner! Imputing to <HI>Credulity,</HI> and the <HI>Malice</HI> of
Misrepresenters, what his Friends, All, consider as an Act of <HI>Violence</HI> and <HI>Barbarity.</HI> There is no <HI>Subject,</HI> which
he, oftner, or with more <HI>Pleasure,</HI> enlarges on, than the <HI>great,</HI> and <HI>noble Qualities,</HI> of the Man who has <HI>undone</HI> him! Nay, he talks, even of his <HI>Justice,</HI> with as

<P>WE had lately the Pleasure of hearing, in a full Meeting, some

for the <HI>Sweetness</HI> of her <HI>Voice,</HI> and the <HI>Strength</HI>

asked us, assoon as she was gone, <PB N="56" REF="65"/> our Opinion of
this Person, to whom, we all knew her <HI>Partial. Ned Volatile</HI>
prevented <HI>any</HI> Answer but his <HI>own</HI>; and desir'd, He might
have Liberty to give it, <HI>under his Hand.</HI> He had Pen and Ink brought
him; and every Bo∣dy was grown <HI>Impatient</HI> for the Product of his <HI>Muse,</HI> when he presented it, in the following VERSES, from <HI>Randolph.</HI></P>
<Q> 
<L>NOW Shame pursue my <HI>medling Sight;</HI></L> 
<L><HI>Wou'd,</HI> I had been <HI>All Ear,</HI> to Night!</L> 
<L>Sweet is her <HI>Voice,</HI> as Flow'rs in <HI>June;</HI></L> 
<L>But ne'er was <HI>Face</HI> so out of <HI>Tune.</HI></L> 
<L><HI>Lower</HI> than <HI>Gammut</HI> are her <HI>Eyes:</HI></L> 
<L>Her <HI>Nose</HI> does above <HI>Ela</HI> rise!</L> 
<L>Were I to chuse my self a <HI>Dear,</HI></L>

<L>Some Women are <HI>All</HI> Tongue—and oh!</L> 
<L>What Joy 'twou'd be, were <HI>This</HI> but so!</L> 
<L>Harmonious <HI>Gods!</HI> to ease my Mind,</L> 
<L>Or strike her <HI>Dumb,</HI> or make me <HI>Blind.</HI></L></Q>
<P>NO sooner had <HI>Ned Volatile</HI> repeated his <HI>Verses,</HI> but a General Applause, of <HI>Laughter,</HI> was return'd
him by the Company. All but the <HI>Widow,</HI> the <HI>Major</HI> and <HI>My-self,</HI> were ex∣travagantly transported with the <HI>Humour</HI>
and the <HI>Satire:</HI> And <HI>Ned</HI> was triumphantly <HI>expand∣ing</HI>
his <HI>Poetry,</HI> with an Air of <HI>Levity,</HI> and <HI>Satisfaction</HI>;
when the <HI>Major,</HI> to prevent <PB N="57" REF="66"/> a second Reading, of
what he saw was <HI>distasteful</HI> to some Part of the <HI>Assembly,</HI> began to speak in this Manner.</P>
<Q> 
<P>THE Company must acknowledge, they are oblig'd to Mr. <HI>Volatile,</HI> for the Pains he is at, to <HI>please</HI> them: But, if
he were as <HI>inclinable</HI> to <HI>reason,</HI> as he is to <HI>entertain,</HI> no Body could convince us sooner, that the <HI>finest
Ri∣dicule</HI> is to be considered but as <HI>Cruelty,</HI> where it borrows
its Subject from Mens <HI>Natural Defects,</HI> or their <HI>Miseries.</HI> I
know very well, that whatever savours of <HI>Instruction</HI> is
of∣fensive in <HI>Conversation</HI>; and that nothing is more <HI>insupportable,</HI> than a <HI>Liberty</HI> People take, of prescribing <HI>Rules</HI> to all the World. We presently wish to fly the Society of
those who <HI>dogmatize:</HI> For the Mind of Man is Generous, and <HI>resists</HI> Truth, or <HI>receives</HI> it, as its Approaches are <HI>Rude</HI> or <HI>Gentle.</HI> But then, there is an equal Inconvenience in
the <HI>contrary Extream:</HI> And if we wou'd enjoy Conversation, with a
Delicacy of <HI>Wit,</HI> we should have Liberty to <HI>bound</HI> it, by the
In∣terposition of our <HI>Judgment.</HI></P> 
<P>THE <HI>Harmony</HI> of this Lady, who has so agreeably
entertain'd us, is a <HI>Beauty</HI> that might weigh against the Absence
of other Charms, more frequent, and perhaps less valuable! 'Tis the Motherly
Indulgence of <HI>Nature,</HI> to rob us of <HI>no</HI> Benefit, without
bestowing on us some other, in a double Proportion. How seldom do we find <HI>all</HI> Accomplishments united in the <HI>same</HI> Person! 
<PB N="58" REF="67"/> <HI>Some</HI> are <HI>happy</HI> in their Humour, and have
their Spirits full of <HI>Fire</HI>; and <HI>swift</HI> and <HI>subtil</HI>
in their <HI>Motion. Others,</HI> not so <HI>sprightly,</HI> have a Blood
more <HI>cold</HI> and <HI>phlegmatic</HI>; but the Course of their Animal
Spirits being <HI>tempe∣rately</HI> regulated, they are <HI>cautious</HI> in <HI>Deli∣beration, strong</HI> and <HI>constant</HI> in <HI>Resolution</HI>; and <HI>unshaken</HI> in their <HI>Enterprizes.</HI>
How <HI>visi∣ble</HI> is this <HI>Difference! One</HI> is <HI>airy</HI> and <HI>faceti∣ous</HI>; the <HI>Other thoughtful</HI> and <HI>judicious.</HI> The <HI>Wit</HI> of <HI>One</HI> is <HI>sharp</HI>; the <HI>Sense</HI> of the <HI>Other, solid.</HI></P> 
<P>I REMEMBER to have seen, during the last War in <HI>Flanders,</HI> in a Town where I had my Winter-Quarters, a wonderful
Example of this <HI>Recompence,</HI> observ'd by Nature. An old Man, who had
been born blind, and had always continued so, had a natural <HI>Sagacity,</HI> that was <HI>prodigious</HI> and scarce <HI>credible!</HI>
A Legacy being left him, to the Value of <HI>Fifty Pistoles,</HI> the poor
Man, who had never ex∣pected to be Master of such a Sum, was un∣der no
small <HI>Solicitude</HI> how to secure his Possession of it. He
determin'd, at last, to dig a Hole in the Cellar, and hide it: But it
happen'd, that a <HI>Dutch</HI> Soldier, who was quartered in the House,
saw him bury the Purse, and went afterwards and stole it. The Blind Man
bethinking himself of a Place <HI>more</HI> convenient, return'd, in an Hour
or two, and discover'd his Misfortune; for which he con∣triv'd an ingenious
Remedy, by <HI>detecting</HI> the <HI>Author</HI> of it, which he judg'd to
have been <PB N="59" REF="68"/> the <HI>Dutch</HI> Soldier; but the Difficulty
was, <HI>how</HI> to <HI>prove</HI> it.</P> 
<P>THEY lay in the same Room; and, at Night, when they were in Bed,
the Blind Man began, under Pretence of Friendship and Confidence, to
consult with the Soldier, concerning a Necessity which he said, he was
under, to <HI>hide</HI> a <HI>hundred Pistoles.</HI> To say Truth, added
he, I have <HI>hid fifty</HI> of them <HI>to Day</HI>; and would dispose of
the <HI>other fifty</HI> in the same Place, to Morrow; only I am desirous
to be satisfy'd, Whether, in Point of <HI>Conscience,</HI> such a
Practice is <HI>unlawful?</HI> My Relations being so extravagant, that they
would <HI>waste</HI> it all, if they could come at it.</P> 
<P>THE <HI>Soldier</HI> swallowed the <HI>Bait,</HI> and <HI>ar∣gued,</HI> like a <HI>Casuist,</HI> to confirm the Intenti∣on;
expecting, now, to get it <HI>all.</HI> He rose, therefore, betimes, and
going into the Cellar, restor'd the fifty Pieces to the Hole, he had taken
them from: The Blind Man went, af∣terwards, and recover'd his Money, as he
expected, by the Success of his Stratagem.</P> </Q>
<P>HERE, the <HI>Major</HI> clos'd his <HI>Speech</HI>; and it was
difficult to say, which had most pleas'd the Hearers, His <HI>Story,</HI>
or his <HI>Good-Nature: Ned Volatile,</HI> himself, tho' his <HI>Vanity</HI>
was a <HI>little</HI> shock'd, felt an Awe, from the <HI>Vertue</HI> and <HI>Plain-Dealing</HI> of his Friend; and, looking <HI>generously out of
Countenance,</HI> told the <HI>Major,</HI> with a serious Smile, 
<Q REND="inline">'That, in Company of 'the <HI>Wise,</HI> none
are <HI>Foolish,</HI> but the <HI>Witty.</HI></Q></P>
<Q><PB N="60" REF="69"/>YET, to shew you, said he, (by this Time,
beginning to recover himself,) That I have <HI>edified</HI> by your <HI>Sermon,</HI> I will make an <HI>ho∣nourable Amends</HI> to the <HI>Ladies,</HI> by producing the Example of a <HI>Living Glory</HI> to their <HI>Sex,</HI> who has also been pleasant on a <HI>natural De∣fect,</HI> but
in a manner, much more <HI>Generous.</HI> She made them, on a <HI>Boy</HI> that
was <HI>Dumb,</HI> but of excellent <HI>Quickness</HI> of <HI>Parts.</HI> And
I speak with the more <HI>Pleasure,</HI> in <HI>Praise</HI> of this <HI>Lady,</HI> because I know I can do no∣thing more <HI>acceptable</HI> to
the <HI>Major,</HI> whom I have often heard declaring himself, One of Her <HI>devoted Admirers.</HI></Q>
<Q> 
<L>I Sing the Boy, who <HI>gagg'd</HI> and <HI>bound,</HI></L> 
<L>Has been, by <HI>Nature, robb'd</HI> of <HI>Sound:</HI></L>

<P>THERE is Nothing more <HI>talk'd</HI> of and less easily <HI>found</HI> than <HI>Friendship</HI>; Every One <HI>Pretends</HI> to <HI>It,</HI> and not <HI>One</HI> in a <HI>Million</HI> really <HI>Possesses</HI> this <HI>Noble Passion,</HI> which is the most

being as Necessary a <HI>Cement,</HI> in Private and Domestick Life, as <HI>Publick Faith</HI> to <HI>Publick Society,</HI> and the greater Commerce of

with the greatest Action of <HI>Generous Friendship</HI> that Human Na∣ture
is capable of <HI>Performing</HI>; and this from an Author of <HI>unexceptionable</HI> Credit, who was both an Eye and Ear Witness to Part
of the Story, which is more remarkable, by happening between <HI>Two

a Perfect Knowledge of <HI>Human Nature,</HI> has thought fit (as it were
Proverbially) to express himself on this Occasion, 
<Q> 
<L>Et infidos agitans Discordia Fratres.</L></Q></P>
<P>IN the Beginning of the XVIth Century, the <HI>Portugueze</HI>
Carracks sailed from <HI>Lisbon</HI> to <HI>Goa,</HI> a very great Colony of <HI>Portugueze,</HI> in the <HI>East-Indies.</HI> These Carracks are the
largest Vessels that press the Ocean: On Board of one of them were
Twelve Hundred Souls, Mariners, Merchants, Passengers, Priests, and
Fryars, who were going on their several Missions esta∣blished in <HI>China</HI> and the <HI>Indies:</HI> The Begin∣ning of their Voyage was
Prosperous; they had doubled the <HI>Cape of Good Hope,</HI> and were
steer∣ing <HI>North-East</HI> to the Continent of <HI>India,</HI> when
some Gentlemen on Board, having studied <HI>Geo∣graphy</HI> and <HI>Navigation,</HI> found in the Latitude in which they then were, a very
great Ridge of Rocks laid down in their Sea Charts; upon this, they apply'd
themselves to the <HI>Captain</HI> <PB N="63" REF="72"/> of the Ship, and
acquainted him with the Danger which they apprehended, desiring him at the
same Time, to communicate what they had discovered to the <HI>Pilot</HI>;
which Request he immediately gratify'd, recommending to the <HI>Pilot</HI> to
lie by in the <HI>Night,</HI> and slacken Sail by <HI>Day,</HI> 'till they
should be past the Danger. By the Discipline of the <HI>Portugueze</HI>
Navy, the Sailing Part is absolutely committed to the Care of the <HI>Pilot,</HI> who is answerable with his Head, for the safe Carriage of
the King's Ship, and under no manner of Direction from the <HI>Captain,</HI>
who commands in all other Respects.</P>
<P>INSTEAD of complying with so reasonable a Request, on which
the Safety of so many Lives depended, the insolent <HI>Pilot,</HI> thinking
it an Affront to be taught in his own Art, crowded more Sail than he carried
before.</P>
<P>THE Observations of these Gentlemen were too true, not to have
a fatal Issue: They had not sailed many Hours, but just upon Break of
Day, (which would have been prevented if they had lain by) the Ship struck
upon a Rock, and broke her Back.</P>
<P>I LEAVE to the Reader's Imagination, what a Scene of Horror this
must be; the Fright of Twelve hundred Persons in the same inevita∣ble
Danger, at the Sight of that instantaneous Death, which star'd them in the
Face!</P>
<P>THE <HI>Captain</HI> in this Distress, order'd the Pinnace to
be launch'd, into which, after hav∣ing toss'd in a small Quantity of
Biscuit, and some few Boxes of Marmelade, he got himself 
<PB N="64" REF="73"/> with nineteen others, who seeing the Danger of a Crowd
in the common Horror, rushing in∣to the Boat, drew their Swords and prevented
the coming in of any more: The same Neces∣sity oblig'd them immediately
to put off, lest their Pinnace should be drawn in by the Suction of the
sinking Carrack.</P>
<P>HERE their Eyes were entertain'd with the most dismal of
Spectacles, the Sight of their sinking Friends, and their Ears with the Cries
of so many in the same Misery, whom they could not help without their own
Destruction; a Scene of Woe, which nothing could alleviate but the
Reflection, that they themselves were not in the same Extremity, though
humanly speaking, they were not in a much better Con∣dition, being
destitute on the vast <HI>Indian</HI> Ocean, in an open Boat, without any
Compass to direct them, without any fresh Water, but what must fall from
those Heavens, whose Mercy alone could deliver them. To which must be
added, the inevitable Danger of being overset by the first Wind that
should raise the Waves, besides the Certainty of perishing assoon
as their small Stock of Provisions should be spent, which only serv'd
to prolong their Miseries by reserving them for a more lingring and cruel
Death. In this Distress, after they had for four Days row∣ed to and fro,
without Guide or Direction, the Captain, who had been sick, and very weak,
for some Time, overcome with Grief and Fa∣tigue, died. This added, if
possible, to their Misery, for now they fell into the last
Con∣fusion, <PB N="65" REF="74"/> Every one would Govern, and none would Obey:
This oblig'd them to chuse one of their own Company to command them, whose
Orders they agreed implicitly, without any Reserve, to follow.</P>
<P>THE Choice fell upon a Gentleman, who was, what the <HI>Portugueze</HI> call a <HI>Mestizzo,</HI> that is, one begotten between
an <HI>European</HI> and an <HI>Indian:</HI> This Person, vested with his
new Authority, proposed to the Company to draw Lots, and throw every fourth
Man overboard, by Reason their Provision was spent so far, as not to
last above three Days longer: They were now Nineteen Persons in all; in
this Number were a Fryar and the Carpenter, both whom, they would exempt, by
Reason of their being so necessary, the One to Ab∣solve and Comfort
them in their last Extremi∣ty, and the other to take Care of the Boat, in
Case of a Leak, or other Accident; the same Compliment they paid to their
new Captain, he being the odd Man, and his Life of more Consequence than any
of the rest. He refu∣sed a great while, but at last acquiesced; so
that there were four to dye out of the sixteen remaining.</P>
<P>THE Three first on whom the Lot fell, after having confess'd,
and receiv'd Absoluti∣on, submitted to their Fate.</P>
<P>THE Fourth, whom Fortune condemn'd, was a <HI>Portugueze</HI>
Gentleman who had a younger Brother in the Boat, who, seeing him about to be
flung over-board, most tenderly embraced <PB N="66" REF="75"/> him, and with
Tears in his Eyes, besought him to let him dye for him; enforcing his
Ar∣guments by telling him, That, <HI>He was a Mar∣ried Man, and had a Wife and
Children at</HI> Goa, <HI>besides the Care of three Sisters who
absolutely de∣pended upon him: That as for himself, he was single, and
his Life of no great Importance; he therefore conjur'd him to let him supply
his Place.</HI></P>
<P>THE Elder Brother astonish'd, and melted with this
Generosity, replied, That <HI>since the Providence of</HI> GOD, <HI>had
appointed him, it would be wicked and unjust to suffer any other to dye for
him, especially a Brother to whom he was so infinitely oblig'd.</HI></P>
<P>THE Younger would take no Denial, but flinging himself on his
Knees, held his Brother so fast, that they could not disengage them: Thus
they disputed for a while, the Elder Bro∣ther bidding him <HI>be a Father to
his Wife and Children, and as he would inherit his Estate, take Care of their
common Sisters</HI>; but all he could say, made him not desist; This
was a Scene of Tenderness which must fill with Pity any Breast
susceptible of generous Impressions!</P>
<P>AT last, as it is no difficult Thing to per∣suade a Man to
live, the <HI>Constancy</HI> of the Elder Brother yielded to the <HI>Piety</HI> of the Younger; he acquiesced, and suffered the Gallant
Young Man to supply his Place; who being flung in∣to the Water, when he came
to it, could not be content to dye; but being a very good Swimmer, got to the
Stern of the Pinnace, and <PB N="67" REF="76"/> laid hold with his right Hand;
which being perceiv'd by one of the Sailors, he cut off the Hand with a
Cutlass, upon which, dropping into the Sea, he caught hold again with his
Left, which received the same Fate by a second Blow; thus dismembered in
his two Hands, he made a shift, notwithstanding, to keep him∣self above
Water, with his Feet and two Stumps.</P>
<P>THIS moving Spectacle so raised the Pity of the whole Crew,
that they cry'd out, <HI>He is but one Man, let us save him</HI>; which was
ac∣cordingly done; and he taken into the Boat, had his Hands bound up as well
as the Place and Circumstances would permit. They row'd all that Night, and
next Morning, when the Sun arose, as if Heaven would reward the Gal∣lantry
and Piety of this Young Man, and for his Sake, save all the rest, they
descry'd Land, which prov'd to be the Mountains of <HI>Mozam∣bique</HI> in <HI>Africk,</HI> where the <HI>Portugueze</HI> have a Colony; hither they all
safely got, where they staid 'till the next Ships from <HI>Lisbon</HI>
pass'd by, and carried this Company to <HI>Goa</HI>; where <HI>Linschotten,</HI> a <HI>Dutch</HI> Author of good Credit, assures us,
That he himself saw them land, supp'd with the two Brothers that very
Night, saw the Younger with his Stumps, and had the Story from both their
Mouths, as well as from the rest of the Company.</P>

tumbled down, from its Stand, and alarm'd one of his Drawers, who

out;</HI> and I, happening, at that Time, to be Drinking behind the <HI>Bar,</HI> run immediate∣ly down; and, as Ill-Luck wou'd have it, came Time
enough to cut the Rope.—Great Endeavours were us'd, to compose his
ruffled Mind.—But, when he was told, the next Morning, in what Manner he
was preserv'd, he grew desperate, and uncomfortable; And nothing wou'd
serve his Turn, but his Rope must be <HI>paid for.</HI>—I have the

<P>MR. <HI>Hawthorn</HI> lost his Anger, in <HI>Ned

</LETTER>
<P>THE <HI>Note,</HI> which he sent back, was that, by which my <HI>Friend</HI> had acknowledged his Receipt of the <HI>Money</HI> he desired
to borrow; and which he promised to repay, on <HI>Demand,</HI> to the <HI>Lender,</HI> or his <HI>Order:</HI> All this, the re∣fined Obliger had <HI>eraz'd</HI> with his <HI>Pen</HI>; and instead of it, wrote what follows,
on the blank Side of the Paper.—<HI>I do hereby declare, That I owe five
Hundred</HI> Guineas, <HI>to my good Friend, Mr. S—, and will always
reserve them in a Readiness for his</HI> Call; <HI>in Return for the</HI> 
<PB N="75" REF="84"/> Pleasure <HI>he has given me, by borrowing of me</HI>
One Hundred.</P>
<P>WHILE we were expressing our <HI>Satisfaction</HI> in this
fine-spirited Instance, of the <HI>Art</HI> of <HI>en∣larging</HI> Favours,
by the <HI>Manner</HI> of conferring them, the <HI>Alderman</HI> was observed
to have <HI>fix'd</HI> his Eyes on the Floor, in a Posture of Thought, and
Sadness, that was very <HI>unusual</HI> in him.—<HI>Ned
Volatile,</HI> who had just made a <HI>Tour,</HI> round the Table, to beg a
Pinch of <HI>Spanish</HI> from the <HI>Coquett</HI>'s <HI>Venetian
Snuff-Box,</HI> passing close behind the <HI>Alderman,</HI> and
supposing him fast asleep, guided Part of it to his <HI>Nose,</HI>
and rows'd him, into a Fit of <HI>Sneezing</HI>; which, as soon as he was
freed from, he looked round for <HI>Ned Volatile</HI>; and, after a <HI>Half
Smile,</HI> and a <HI>Sober Wag</HI> of his <HI>Head,</HI> thus addressed
him∣self to the <HI>Company.</HI></P>
<P>I KNEW, I owed this <HI>Favour</HI> to the Wan∣tonness of that
young <HI>Mad-cap</HI>; who is as full of <HI>Mischief</HI> as a <HI>Monkey.</HI> He fancy'd, I was <HI>nodding</HI>; and, truly, I am sorry,
that he hap∣pened to be mistaken; for I was <HI>musing,</HI> and very <HI>melancholy.</HI>—This Story of the <HI>Major</HI>'s brought afresh
into my Mind an extraordinary Accident that I met with, my self, in the Year
of the <HI>Great Frost,</HI> that was before the <HI>Revo∣lution.</HI></P>
<P>MANY <HI>Losses,</HI> that Year, had disabled me to make
good my Credit; so that I was <HI>run upon,</HI> by my Enemies; and gave
myself up for no Better than a <HI>Gone Man.</HI> But, one Morning,
early,—I shall never forget it!—I was just <PB N="76" REF="85"/>
come down into my <HI>Counting House,</HI> in my Night-Gown, and
Slippers;—when, in comes a Porter, and delivers me a Letter; and away he
goes, immediately, without asking for an Answer.—The Letter was from a
Merchant, that had formerly been my Best Friend; but we had <HI>broke
off,</HI> for some Years, upon my re∣fusing to lend him a <HI>Thousand
Pounds,</HI> upon his <HI>Bond</HI>; and we had never convers'd, since that
Time, till now, that he sent this Letter; the Contents of which, were to tell
me, That he was sorry to hear, what was reported abroad, to the <HI>Discredit</HI> of my <HI>Circumstances</HI>; for he knew, it must be
owing to some <HI>unfortunate</HI> Accident; since, whatever <HI>Defects</HI> I had, I could never <HI>want Frugality.</HI>—But,
however, says he, If <HI>Five Thousand Pounds</HI> can save you, call for
it when you please, and I will lend it you, by Way of <HI>Punishment,</HI>
for an <HI>Unkindness</HI> of Yours, formerly: And since the Mortification
This must give you, merits Pardon for your Fault, I will <HI>forget it,</HI>
from this Time forward, that we may be Friends again, as usual.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Alderman</HI> interrupted himself in this Part of his <HI>Story,</HI> by a sudden Burst of <HI>Tears</HI>; which he strove, in
vain, to suppress; and which affected the whole <HI>Assembly</HI> with
a <HI>Sympathy,</HI> more <HI>touching,</HI> than could have been excited by
the most pathetick Force of <HI>Elo∣quence.</HI>—He recover'd
himself, after a short Pause, and went on, to inform us, That, with∣in
less than a Week, after he had sav'd him∣self from <HI>Ruin,</HI> by
Receipt of this Money, his <PB N="77" REF="86"/> generous Friend, the <HI>Merchant,</HI> fell out of a <HI>Boat,</HI> below Bridge, and was,
unfortunately drown'd.—It is true, continu'd the good <HI>Alderman,</HI>
I repaid it, very punctually, and have made all Acknowledgments, and done all
Services, in my Power, to his sorrowful <HI>Widow,</HI> and his <HI>Children.</HI>—But, <HI>alas!</HI> What did all <HI>That</HI>
signify?—<HI>He</HI> was dead, that had <HI>Oblig'd</HI> me:—And <HI>gone,</HI> beyond all Possibi∣lity of ever knowing how I <HI>repented</HI> my unkind Usage of him! and what a <HI>Shame,</HI> and a <HI>Change,</HI> his <HI>Generosity</HI> had produced in me!</P>
<P>He would willingly have spoke more; but could not support his <HI>Anguish</HI>;—and wept again, very passionately; so that
rising ab∣ruptly, he hastened out of the Room, and left <HI>Us all</HI> in
great <HI>Disorder.</HI></P>

<P>I YESTERDAY went to see a very agree∣able Friend, at whose
House, I found a handsome Appearance of Young People of both SEXES. Upon my
Entrance, every one <PB N="78" REF="87"/> rose, and very obligingly proffered
me a Seat, each insisting on the Preference I should give in Acceptance
of the Honour design'd me.</P>
<P>AS I was unwilling to disoblige any One, where All had treated
me with so much Civili∣ty, I wink'd at my Friend, who, with great Formality,
conducted me to a large Elbow-Chair; and put an End to the Dispute.</P>
<P>WHILE I was wondring with a secret Pleasure, at such an <HI>unaccustom'd</HI> Piece of <HI>Good-breeding,</HI> and examining the
Countenances of the Com∣pany, my Friend, who till then had discours'd of
indifferent Matters, told me with a Smile, <HI>He had assembled this Sett
of Young People, with a Promise of shewing them the</HI> PLAIN DEALER, <HI>and therefore desir'd, I would throw</HI> aside <HI>all</HI>
Re∣servedness, <HI>and look upon</HI> every one <HI>as my</HI> pro∣fess'd
Admirer, <HI>and</HI> Friend, which was imme∣diately confirm'd by a <HI>General
Reverence.</HI></P>
<P>I THANK'D him for the <HI>Favour</HI> he had done me, in
introducing me to such Agreeable Society; and could not help discovering by
my Looks, the inward Satisfaction I felt, at the Sight of so much <HI>Youth,</HI> and <HI>Beauty</HI>; which ended in that melancholy Reflection, <HI>How many</HI> Dangers <HI>it was</HI> expos'd <HI>to, and how easily it
might be</HI> vitiated.</P>
<P>WHEN the Tea-Equipage was remov'd, and every One remained silent
in Expectation of what I should say, the Charming <HI>Leonilla,</HI> my
Friend's Eldest Daughter, after having first fix'd her Eyes on a Young Lady
that sat op∣posite to her, and then on me, desir'd in Be∣half 
<PB N="79" REF="88"/> of Part of the Company, I would give my Opinion in the
Case of <HI>That</HI> Restriction <HI>Young Women lie under, who, from
a</HI> Custom, <HI>which, in her Opinion, had no</HI> just Grounds <HI>for
its Support, are</HI> forbid <HI>by</HI> Decency, <HI>let their</HI>
Passion <HI>be the most</HI> vertuous <HI>and</HI> tender <HI>that was
ever felt, to make the least</HI> Advance, <HI>by which the Party belov'd
may</HI> discover <HI>the</HI> Sen∣timents <HI>they have in his Favour.</HI>
To which I answer'd, <HI>A Woman of Sense can never</HI> feel <HI>that</HI>
Tenderness <HI>for a</HI> Fool;—<HI>and a Man of</HI> Sense <HI>would
always reckon such a</HI> Declaration, <HI>a</HI> Desire <HI>of</HI>
enjoying <HI>that</HI> Happiness, <HI>whose</HI> Basis <HI>is</HI> Love, <HI>and whose</HI> Support <HI>is</HI> Virtue.</P>
<P>AFTER I had delivered my Opinion in Fa∣vour of <HI>Leonilla,</HI>
I turn'd to the Lady, with whom (I could perceive by the Blush in her Cheeks)
she had been disputing, and told her, <HI>There was a</HI> false, <HI>as
well as a</HI> true <HI>Decency; and that</HI> One <HI>consisted in</HI>
Grimace <HI>and</HI> Shew, <HI>the</HI> Other <HI>in an</HI> open Deportment, <HI>the</HI> Result <HI>of an unaffected, disinterested</HI> Love <HI>of</HI> Virtue. <HI>And that it would always be found, a Man has no more
Reason to</HI> conceive Hopes <HI>from the</HI> free Con∣verse <HI>of
the</HI> Latter, <HI>than to</HI> fear Success <HI>from the</HI> distant
Carriage <HI>of the</HI> Former. True Vir∣tue <HI>wants no Foil, and is never
talking of itself.</HI> False Virtue, <HI>sensible of its</HI>
Weakness, <HI>is forc'd to have Recourse to</HI> Hypocrisy, <HI>and is
ever boasting a</HI> Strength <HI>it is a</HI> Stranger <HI>to.</HI></P>
<P>AS I was running on in this grave Dis∣course, I was
interrupted by a young Gentle∣man, who told us, he had just met with a Copy 
<PB N="80" REF="89"/> of VERSES, said to be written by Lady <HI>W—y
M—e,</HI> wherein he thought there was the most Delicate Sense of <HI>Virtue,</HI> mixed with the most agreeable <HI>Turn</HI> of <HI>Wit.</HI>
Upon the whole Company's desiring to see it, he pulled a Paper out of his
Pocket, and read as follows.</P>

<P>MY Friend perceiving both Parties grew warm, desir'd them,

persuaded the PLAIN DEALER would print the <HI>Occurrences</HI> of that Day.
Upon which, they all <HI>compos'd</HI> their Looks, and a <HI>general

me∣thinks, no Proportion, in Comparison with others, of a much blacker
Complexion; to which notwithstanding, they seem <HI>parallell'd,</HI> by
the Equality of their <HI>Sentence.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Life</HI> of a Man is, so infinitely of more Value than
his <HI>Beast,</HI> or his <HI>Moveable,</HI> that, whenever I see the
Sufferings of pinch'd, and hunger-starv'd <HI>Wretches,</HI> under the
Agonies of an <HI>Execution</HI>; for having <HI>robb'd</HI> perhaps to avoid <HI>famishing</HI>; I find myself oppress'd by a <HI>Grief,</HI> which
nothing mitigates, but this <HI>Reflection</HI>—That their <HI>Lives</HI>
were expos'd to such Extremities of Want, and Misery, that their <HI>Death</HI> should be a Comfort.—And yet, the long protracted
Gazings, the Paleness, the Tremblings, and the ghastly, distorted Faces,
of the poor departing Strugglers (who die with strong Reluctance, and linger,
and lengthen out, their last painful Moment) make it evi∣dent, to the <HI>Beholders,</HI> That, Unfriendly as the World was to them, they are not
willing to forsake it.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="94"/>I AM convinc'd, that if it were possible
to see, on some such <HI>Plain,</HI> as that of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> under
one assembled Prospect, the whole Num∣ber, of Men and Women, who have
been exe∣cuted, <HI>for Theft only,</HI> in all the Counties of this Kingdom,
within the Memory of any Per∣son, of but a moderate Advance in Years; such
a dreadful Demonstration of the <HI>Waste,</HI> which is made, by this <HI>Sweep</HI> of the <HI>Sword</HI> of <HI>Justice,</HI> would be a
startling Inducement to those, whose Province it is known to be, to
weigh, with Pity, and Deliberation, whether Punish∣ments, more <HI>adequate,</HI> and more <HI>politick,</HI> too, than <HI>Death,</HI> might
not easily be appropriated to a Number of <HI>Petty Crimes,</HI> which ever
were, and ever must be, unavoidably frequent, in all peopled Places; being
the necessary Con∣sequences, either of the <HI>Wants,</HI> or the <HI>Depra∣vity,</HI> of the lowest Part of the <HI>Human Species.</HI></P>
<P>ONE Evening, very lately, All my Neigh∣bourhood, in <HI>Barbican,</HI> were in an Uproar, on a sudden; and I was disturb'd, in
my Medi∣tations, by the shrieking of Women, the mix'd Cries of Children, and
a growing <HI>Hum</HI> of Con∣course, that seem'd close under my
Window.—I threw aside my Pipe; and, hastening to look out, saw the
Street entirely fill'd, by a <HI>Groupe</HI> of dismal Faces; that had
gather'd themselves into a Tumult, about a House, directly opposite, and
appear'd to be touch'd, as strongly as Common Natures are capable, with a
Mixture of <HI>Surprize</HI> and <HI>Sorrow.</HI> It seems, the Husband of a
laborious, poor Crea∣ture, <PB N="86" REF="95"/> who was Mistress of this
House, had been condemn'd, at the County Assizes, in one of the late
Circuits, for stealing a Horse: And a Letter had, just now, been
deliver'd to his Wife; which the Criminal himself had writ∣ten, the very
Morning he was executed.</P>
<P>HIS Relations and Acquaintance had de∣pended on a <HI>Reprieve</HI>; for the Man was uni∣versally belov'd among his Neighbours:
And, tho' always very poor, and unfortunate in his Dealings, had been
remarkable for his Industry; of a sober Disposition, and never known,
be∣fore, to have been guilty of the least Disho∣nesty. He had Six
Children alive, and the Eldest but Eight Years old. His Mother, who liv'd in
the same little House, had been disabled, by Sickness, for several
Months past: So that, perceiving it beyond his Power to subsist his
Family any longer, and not daring to stay in Town, by Reason of some
Debts he had contracted, he went down, to <HI>try his Friends,</HI> who liv'd,
in good Circumstances, in the Country. But, instead of meeting with <HI>Assistance,</HI> he only spent, in this Journey, all the little he
had carried with him: And not being able to support the Thoughts of
return∣ing, <HI>without Bread,</HI> to a Family, in such want of it, he rode
away with a Horse, which he found ty'd to a Gate; and being pursu'd, and
overtaken, was try'd, condemn'd, and hang'd, for it.</P>
<P>THIS History was loudly given me, by the good Women, in the
Street; after which, <PB N="87" REF="96"/> I had the Curiosity to press in,
among the Crowd; and was struck, at my first Entrance, by the most <HI>moving</HI> Scene of <HI>Sorrow,</HI> that I ever remember to have met
with. The Wi∣dow had broke open her Husband's Letter, in Transport,
concluding, That it brought her the Confirmation of a <HI>Reprieve,</HI> which
a former had given her Hopes of. But she was so shock'd, and overwhelm'd
by the sudden Reverse of Pas∣sion, that her Grief was a kind of <HI>Madness.</HI> She sat on the Floor without Headcloaths; and had an
Infant, cross her Knees, that was crying, with great Impatience, for the <HI>Breast,</HI> it had been thrown from. Another <HI>slept</HI> in a <HI>Cradle,</HI> close by a little <HI>Bed,</HI> in which the <HI>Grandmother</HI> sat weeping; bending forward in strong Agony; and
wringing her Hands in silence. The Four Eldest Children were gather'd into
a Knot, and clung about the Neck of their miserable Mother: <HI>stamping,
screaming,</HI> and <HI>kissing her,</HI> in a Storm of distracted <HI>Tenderness!</HI>—The poor Woman, <HI>herself,</HI> was in a
Condition, <HI>past describing!</HI> She press'd the Letter of her <HI>dead Husband,</HI> to her <HI>Eyes!</HI>—her <HI>Lips!</HI>—her <HI>Bosom!</HI>—She rav'd, and talk'd, and question'd him, as if he
had been present!—And, at every little Interval, dry'd her <HI>Tears,</HI> with his <HI>Letter:</HI> And cast a Look upon the Com∣pany,
so <HI>wild!</HI> and so full of <HI>Horror!</HI> that it cannot be
conceiv'd, but by those, who were Witnesses of it.</P>
<P>AS soon as she saw <HI>me</HI> there, she stretched out
her Hand; and made Signs, that I should read <PB N="88" REF="97"/> the Letter;
which I received from her, accord∣ingly. And going back, to my Lodging, with a
Resolution to send over some fitter Person than myself, to
assist, in the Distresses of so dis∣consolate a Family, I
sat down, and took a Copy of it, because it <HI>moved</HI> me
exceedingly.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>Dear, Loving <HI>Betty,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is now nine a Clock; and I must be fetch'd out, by and by,
and go to die, before Eleven. I shall see my poor <HI>Bess</HI> no more,
in this World; but, if we meet one another again in the next, as I hope in God
we shall, we may never part after∣wards. Methinks, if I cou'd but only once
more look upon my good <HI>Betty</HI> before I die, tho' it shou'd be but for
a Minute; and say a kind Word to my Fatherless Children, that must <HI>Starve now,</HI> if God don't take Care for them, I should go, away, with
a good Heart. And yet sometimes I fancy, it is better <HI>as it is,</HI> for
it wou'd be <HI>sad,</HI> to die, afterwards, and I fear it wou'd make me
faint∣hearted: and I should be wishing, that I might live, to get you <HI>Bread,</HI> and Cloaths, for your poor precious Bodies. <HI>Sarah
Taylor</HI> made my Heart ake, when she told me, that you had pawn'd away,
every thing, to make up that <HI>last fifty Shillings</HI> that you sent me
by <HI>Will. Sanderson,</HI> who is now in the Room with me, and sits down
upon the <HI>Straw</HI> that I laid on, last Night, and is weeping for me
like a Child. But God will make up all the Money to you again, that you have
let me have, to no purpose. And I should be sorry that any unkind Body
should hit <PB N="89" REF="98"/> it in your Teeth, that I come to such an
untime∣ly, bad End: For I thought as little of it, as they do. But all the Way
as I walked up to <HI>London,</HI> afoot, I could not help having a Fan∣cy in
my Head at every Turn, That I saw my poor dear <HI>Betty,</HI> and my six
helpless little <HI>Ones</HI> hanging upon me, and crying out bitterly, That
they had no Bread, to keep Life in 'em; and begging me to buy them some. And
so, I thought that I would sell that <HI>Horse,</HI> and make you
be∣lieve, that I got Money, of your <HI>Sister Parker:</HI> But she was too <HI>Sparing,</HI> for <HI>that;</HI> and wou'd never once look upon me.—I
pray to God to forgive her, and, if she wou'd but be Good to <HI>you,</HI>
when I am gone, God bless her.—<HI>Loving Betty,</HI> remember me to my
sorrowful Mother, and tell her not to <HI>take on</HI> too much. And bid <HI>Richard</HI> and <HI>Harry,</HI> take Warning by <HI>my Fall,</HI> if ever
they come to be <HI>Men:</HI> And, for the poor Girls, they are too young, as
yet, to understand any thing you can say to them. God's Goodness be your
Comfort, and if you can, don't <HI>think</HI> about <HI>me,</HI> for it will
make you only melancholly.—I hope, the Old <HI>Deputy</HI> will be kind
to you, and help you to do somewhat. I am sorry I can't write no more,
because my Tears are come into my Eyes.—Little did I think of this <HI>dismal Parting</HI>—Oh! 'tis very sad!—God bless you, in
this un∣happy World; Dear, Dear <HI>Betty,</HI></P>

<P><HI>P.S.</HI> Nothing vexes me, but when I think that it is a

say, the King is to have him; he is not worth much: but if my poor <HI>Betty</HI> had the Mo∣ney, he cou'd be Sold for, it wou'd be some Comfort

</LETTER>
<P>I carry'd this Letter with me to the <HI>Assem∣bly:</HI> where
it was universally Agreed, That there is a plain-hearted Honesty, very
mani∣fest in all Parts of it; and a generous and manly Sorrow, not arising
so much from his own Desire to <HI>Live,</HI> as from a Prospect of <HI>their Wants,</HI> whom his Death was to leave <HI>Destitute.</HI> Our
Clergyman, in particular, was greatly mov'd to Compassion; and propos'd a
Chari∣table Collection, to be sent to the poor <HI>Widow,</HI> to which
himself contributed <HI>first,</HI> in a very liberal Proportion.</P>
<P>He related to us afterwards an extraordinary <HI>Dying
Speech,</HI> of a very different Turn; which he heard made when a <HI>Student,</HI> by a House∣breaker, who was hang'd for <HI>Murder</HI> and
a <HI>Robbery.</HI></P>
<Q><HI>GOOD People, said the Criminal,</HI> since I am to serve
you, for a <HI>Sight,</HI> the least you can do, is to be <HI>Civil</HI> to
the Man that <HI>entertains</HI> you. I ask nothing of you, but the Justice,
that is due to me. There are some medling Tongues, <PB N="91" REF="100"/>
which I can hear among the Crowd, very busy to incense you. Tho' it is
true, I have <HI>committed Murder,</HI> yet I hope I am <HI>no Murderer.</HI>
The <HI>Felony</HI> I really purpos'd; but my <HI>Intention</HI> had no part in
the <HI>Death</HI> that I was Guilty of. The Deceas'd cry'd for Help, and was
so Obstinate, and Clamorous, that I was under a Necessity to <HI>kill</HI> him; or submit my self to be taken. And thus I argued in my
Mind. If I <HI>Murder</HI> him, I shall <HI>get off;</HI> or, at worst, if
I am taken, my Punishment will be <HI>no greater,</HI> than if I spare him,
and <HI>Surrender:</HI> I can be <HI>BUT HANG'D</HI> for <HI>Murder,</HI> and I
must be <HI>HANG'D TOO,</HI> for the <HI>House-breaking!</HI> This Thought,
Good People, prevail'd with me to <HI>Shoot</HI> him; so that what <HI>you</HI> call <HI>Murder,</HI> was but <HI>Self-Preservation.</HI> Now
that I shou'd have dy'd in this <HI>same Manner,</HI> whether I had Shot
him, or no, Witness these two <HI>Weak Brothers</HI> here, who look as if
they were already at the other End of their <HI>Voyage,</HI> tho' they have not <HI>hoisted Sail</HI> yet! one of these <HI>Stole some Bacon,</HI> and
the other, a <HI>wet Smock or two.</HI> The <HI>LAW</HI> must be certainly <HI>Wiser</HI> than <HI>you are;</HI> and since <HI>that</HI> has been
pleas'd to set our Crimes on a <HI>Level,</HI> be so civil or
compas∣sionate as to hold your silly Tongues, and let me <HI>die,</HI>
without <HI>Slander.</HI></Q>
<P>We had several other Stories, on this Sub∣ject, of the <HI>Publick Executions:</HI> but none pleas'd me better, than one, which I
shall close my Paper with; and which we were also oblig'd to the <HI>Vicar</HI> for.</P>
<Q><PB N="92" REF="101"/>THE late King of <HI>Sweden</HI> had
con∣demn'd a Soldier to <HI>die</HI>; and stood at a little Distance from
the Place of Execu∣tion. The Fellow, when he heard this, was in hopes of a <HI>Pardon</HI>; but being assur'd he was mistaken, cry'd, his <HI>Tongue</HI> was yet <HI>free,</HI> he wou'd use it, at his Pleasure;
which he did, with great License; accusing the King, most insolently,
and as loud as he cou'd speak, of <HI>Barbarity</HI> and <HI>Injustice,</HI> and ap∣pealing to God, for <HI>Revenge</HI> of his <HI>wrong'd Innocence.</HI> The King not hearing him, dis∣tinctly, enquir'd
of those about him, <HI>What the Soldier had been saying?</HI> and was
told, by a General Officer, who was unwilling to heigh∣ten his Resentment
against the <HI>Miserable,</HI> That he had only repeated, very often and
loud, <HI>That God loves the Merciful, and teaches the Mighty to moderate their
Anger.</HI> The King was touch'd by the <HI>Lesson,</HI> and sent his
Pardon to the Criminal. But a Courtier of an opposite Interest, took
Advantage of this Occasion, and repeated to the King ex∣actly the
Licentiousness of the Fellow's <HI>Railing</HI>; adding gravely when he had
done, That Men of Quality, and Trust, ought never, in his Opinion, to <HI>misrepresent Facts to their Sovereign.</HI> The King for some Time
stood suspended in his Thoughts, but turn∣ing at length toward the
Courtier, with a Face of Reproof, <HI>It is the first Time,</HI> says he, <HI>that ever I have been betrayed for my Ad∣vantage!</HI> <PB N="93" REF="102"/> <HI>But the LYE of your Enemy, pleas'd me better, than your TRUTH
does.</HI></Q>

when it furnish'd her with an Oc∣casion to divert herself at the Expence

<P>WELL! If this should, in good Earnest, come to pass, I
shall have a most uncomforta∣ble Time of it! What Reason I have had, and
from what Time, to suspect it, I shall, without Reserve, communicate,

of this Preamble is from an un∣usual Disorder, in which I am come Home this

should have thought it <HI>not worth telling.</HI></P>
<P>TO Day, when she <HI>hoyden'd</HI> into the As∣sembly, the
whole Company rose together, and received her with that Pleasure, which her <HI>Gayety</HI> diffuses every where. She sailed through us all, with a <HI>swimming, smiling Port,</HI> that was visibly <HI>affected,</HI> but
irresistably enga∣ging!—When she had flutter'd, and fidget∣ed, and
sloped her self forward, and wheel'd down her Hoop, to the widest Swell
of its <HI>Convex,</HI> in a Circular Course of <HI>Curtesies</HI>; she
tript sideways to her Seat; and I was just be∣ginning <PB N="95" REF="104"/>
to hope <HI>Calm Weather,</HI> after such a <HI>Whirl-wind</HI> of <HI>Ceremony!</HI> when she rose, as it were in a <HI>Start,</HI> with a
Look most <HI>whimsical∣ly Serious</HI>; and drawing a Paper from her
Bo∣som, pac'd demurely to <HI>my Chair</HI>—She carry'd her Head to the
left side, softly sweep∣ing her right Eye-Brow, with the <HI>Knob</HI> of
her <HI>Fan,</HI> and sinking forward, when she came near me, with a
Fantastical Air of Languishment, brush'd my Mouth with her Paper; and
be∣gan to play over her Tricks, in a long and mystical <HI>Jargon</HI> of <HI>most Womanish Impertinence.</HI></P>
<P><HI>AND were they,</HI> said she, <HI>so naughty, to leave
it by it's nown self? And did no body help it to write it's</HI>
PLAIN-DEALERS? <HI>and was it abus'd, and over-work'd and neglected? Well then,
let it be Good, and mind it's Book, and wash it's Face, and forget to be
cross, and comb it's Head, and throw away it's dirty Stick; and see what I
intend to do for it! There take it, and Print it; And, don't care a Pin for the
Work they have put upon it. For I love it, and will think for it; and bring it
good Things. And if it wou'dn't look Grim, I should buss it, and stroak
it, and chuck it under the Chin; and make much of it, and play with it,
and</HI>—&amp;c.—&amp;c.—&amp;c.—</P>
<P>AFTER this silly Rate, she ran on, with a ridiculous, but
lively and never-ending Volu∣bility: and perceiving, that the Company laugh'd
out, and were diverted at the grotesque Figure I was making under her Hand's,
at length she kiss'd me out-right, and set 'em all, <PB N="96" REF="105"/>
in an <HI>Uproar.</HI> I wou'd fain have look'd peevish. I turn'd my Face
from her, and cry'd <HI>Pish</HI>—and <HI>Pshaw</HI>—and <HI>Fiddle</HI>—and shook my Head in a great Heat, and winch'd in both
Shoulders; and much Pains I took, to seem nettled, and uneasy. But, to
confess a foolish Truth, it was all, but <HI>mere Show</HI>; for I was
never so agreeably made an Ass of in my Life, and while I felt the busy
Wanderings of her Fingers about my Face, I was stung I can't tell how, with a
Kind of tingling Delight, all over me; which being desirous to prolong, I
pretended to make Efforts for pushing her away; and under that Pretence, gave
my Hands the Opportunity of <HI>touching</HI> her, here and there—And I
must own, I was sorry when she put an End to her <HI>Gambols.</HI></P>
<P>BUT as soon as I came home, and look'd into her Paper, I was not
so much an <HI>Ass,</HI> (far gone as I found My-self) but that I
pre∣sently discern'd her <HI>Drift:</HI> And I wish, with all my Heart,
that I had Courage enough to return it her; and tell her, in downright Terms, <HI>I don't think it worth Printing.</HI> But whatever the Cause of this

<HEAD>The <HI>LADIES</HI> Equivalent. <HI>A TALE,</HI> with a <HI>MORAL</HI> to It.</HEAD>
<P>IN the Reign of the Emperor <HI>Justinian,</HI> the City
of <HI>Constantinople</HI> was much throng'd with <HI>Foreigners</HI>; for
whose Entertainment, <HI>unusual Pastimes</HI> were invented. The Publick
Theatres were embellish'd, interlarded and embroider'd, with <HI>Musick,
Magick</HI> and <HI>Tumbling</HI>; and such <HI>unspeakable</HI> Additions,
as were fittest to give Pleasure to the <HI>Eyes</HI> of <HI>Goths,
Vandals,</HI> and <HI>Saracens,</HI> to whom <HI>Plays, alone,</HI> were
insipid, because acted in a Language, which they were, in a Manner, wholly
Strangers to.</P>
<P><HI>THEODORA,</HI> the Empress, had been formerly a <HI>Comedian,</HI> and was a liberal Pro∣moter of whatever cou'd contribute to
make Pleasure pompous. Among the Numbers, who found their Interest in this <HI>Byas</HI> of the <HI>Court,</HI> there was a wily and egregious <HI>African</HI>; whom for the Flatness of his Nose, the Tawniness of his
Complexion, and a certain <HI>Majestical Bru∣tality,</HI> in the
Composition of his Features, the merry <HI>Greeks</HI> had nicknamed the <HI>LYON.</HI> This Man became rich, by the universal Encouragement, that was
given to an odd Project, of his starting.—It was a Kind of <HI>Blind-Buzzard,</HI> or <HI>Midnight-Mummery</HI>; of which it is difficult,
at this great Distance of Time, to conceive a clear Notion: But Per∣sons of
the highest Rank, of both Sexes, met there, disguis'd, and under borrow'd
Resem∣blances, <PB N="98" REF="107"/> danc'd, regal'd, and discours'd with
each other, at large, and disengag'd from all <HI>Ceremony,
Distinction,</HI> or <HI>Punctilio.</HI></P>
<P>IT was generally allow'd, however, by all but the <HI>LYON</HI>'s Enemies, that nothing pass'd in these Meetings, either
Scandalous or Misbe∣coming: Every thing was Magnificent, Orna∣mental, and
Enlivening: But no <HI>Privacies</HI> were permitted, nor <HI>Indecencies</HI>
connived at.</P>
<P>IT fell out, notwithstanding, most unfor∣tunately for
the <HI>LYON,</HI> That <HI>Religion</HI> was at this Time very flaming, and
watchful. The <HI>Good Fathers</HI> of the Church became scandalized, and
alarm'd, at the Probability of <HI>Impurities,</HI> in this new-invented <HI>Nightwork:</HI> For, it was dangerous, they knew, to allow such Latitude
to their <HI>Female Flock,</HI> while their Shepherds were at Rest, who kept
the <HI>Wolf</HI> from <HI>biting</HI> them. They determine, therefore,
vigorously to <HI>remonstrate</HI> against it. But there was One
considerable <HI>Rub,</HI> that lay full in their Way. The <HI>Emperor
himself</HI> was often present at these Meetings, and indulg'd them, as
an innocent, and agreeable Recreation.</P>
<P>TO Remove this heavy <HI>Difficulty,</HI> the <HI>Good
Fathers,</HI> with great <HI>Dexterity,</HI> charg'd the Mo∣tive of their <HI>Fears,</HI> upon the <HI>Weakness</HI> of the <HI>Women,</HI> whose
Natures, they said, were liable to very dangerous <HI>Impressions,</HI>
from those Whisper∣ings, and Squeezings, and Inflammations of their <HI>Vanity.</HI> They went on to assert, That a <HI>Woman</HI>'s Defence
against <HI>Man,</HI> lying rather in her Dread of <HI>Shame,</HI> than her
Abhorrence of <HI>Iniquity,</HI> <PB N="99" REF="108"/> she shou'd never be
thought <HI>Safe,</HI> while under the Hazard of <HI>Temptations.</HI> The <HI>Men</HI> indeed, <HI>they believ'd,</HI> might be <HI>strong</HI> enough
to <HI>resist</HI>; but not their <HI>Wives,</HI> and their <HI>Daughters:</HI> Weak Vessels! and brittle! and which wou'd <HI>break</HI> with a <HI>Fall!</HI> It were Prudence therefore, to place them
out of the <HI>publick Reach,</HI> and <HI>cupboard</HI> them up, for the
Houshold Use of their <HI>Owners:</HI> So they humbly represented, That
it wou'd be an Act of great <HI>Piety</HI> and <HI>E∣dification,</HI> if his
Imperial Majesty gave Com∣mand for the Total <HI>Suppression</HI> of
these New <HI>Nurseries</HI> of <HI>Debauchery.</HI></P>
<P>IT is one Thing to be <HI>Pious,</HI> and another to be <HI>Wise.</HI> The Warmth of their <HI>Zeal</HI> had not suffer'd them to
consider, That there were <HI>Women</HI> of <HI>Wit,</HI> and <HI>Spirit,</HI> who would vindi∣cate their <HI>Sex's Honour</HI>; and make
use of their powerful <HI>Influence,</HI> to oppose the good <HI>End</HI>
of these Reverend Memorialists, were it for no other Reason but because
the Means were un∣mannerly. <HI>THEODORA,</HI> the Empress, was provok'd to
the last Degree; and after reproach∣ing their <HI>Partiality,</HI> and the
mean and false <HI>Idea's,</HI> which they had conceiv'd, of <HI>Womens
Virtue,</HI> fell to reason with them in this Manner.</P>
<Q>HOW Contemptibly wou'd your <HI>Sex</HI> com∣pel us to
consider them, if all <HI>Men</HI> were to treat us with so ungenerous a <HI>Diffidence!</HI> Is it possible, think ye, That our <HI>Persons</HI>
can be won, before our <HI>Hearts</HI> have dispos'd of 'em? And, whenever we <HI>Love passionately,</HI> we have Courage to <HI>Act resolutely</HI>;
and <HI>make</HI> <PB N="100" REF="109"/> Opportunities, if we were not allow'd
to <HI>find</HI> 'em. If you once confine our <HI>Bodies,</HI> you set our <HI>Minds</HI> at full Liberty. Our <HI>Natures</HI> are too generous, to <HI>deceive</HI> those who <HI>trust</HI> us. But we think it a <HI>Merit,</HI> to make <HI>Fools</HI> of the <HI>Faithless.</HI></Q>
<P>THE <HI>LYON,</HI> grinning horribly, behind the
Empress's Chair, was ready to <HI>roar,</HI> with De∣light, at this Rebuke to
the Fathers. But, stedfast, and immoveable, in the <HI>Piety</HI> of their <HI>Purpose,</HI> they were about to Reply at Large: When the Emperor, who
had <HI>Meanings</HI> not to be trac'd on his <HI>Countenance,</HI> concealing
his Resentment, return'd this <HI>Answer</HI> to their <HI>Re∣monstrance.</HI></P>
<Q> 
<P> I Thank you, for this <HI>Religious Simplicity,</HI> of
your Proceeding. You are the <HI>Eyes</HI> of our <HI>Conscience,</HI> and <HI>see farther</HI> than we can. But I am not more pleas'd with your
apply∣ing for <HI>Redress</HI> of this <HI>formidable Grievance,</HI> than
surpriz'd, at your <HI>overlooking</HI> another, of like Tendency; and which
your <HI>laudable Zeal,</HI> for <HI>Removing Temptations,</HI> must excite
you, to thank me, for resolving to see re∣medy'd.</P> 
<P> THE <HI>Women</HI> have a <HI>Custom,</HI> when they
stand in need of <HI>Absolution,</HI> to <HI>send for</HI> their
Confessor, and open their Hearts to him, in their <HI>Closets.</HI> Were
all your Reverend <HI>Or∣der</HI> of equal <HI>Sanctity</HI> with <HI>you,</HI>
this cou'd possibly administer no just Cause of <HI>Scandal:</HI>
But, since <HI>Nature</HI> is <HI>deprav'd,</HI> and there have been <HI>Wolves, in Sheep's Cloathing,</HI> I conceive <PB N="101" REF="110"/> it a
Design, of <HI>much Edification,</HI> to abolish, for the future, this <HI>Indulgence</HI> of the <HI>Women</HI>; and withhold their <HI>Absolution,</HI> 'till they come for it, to the <HI>Churches.</HI>
Intending therefore to join these <HI>good Purposes</HI> in <HI>One,</HI> I
commit it to your Care, to prepare an <HI>Edict,</HI> for <HI>Both,</HI> that I
may decree it into <HI>Law,</HI> with as much speed, as possible.</P></Q>
<P>THE <HI>Good Fathers</HI> were, so unexpectedly, and beyond
measure, <HI>confounded,</HI> at this over-liberal <HI>Extent</HI> of the
Emperor's <HI>pious Purpose,</HI> that they stood long, at a Loss, to
find fit Words to thank him. But they did it at last, with this <HI>Hope,</HI> in the <HI>Rear</HI> of <HI>all</HI>;—That his High and
Imperial Majesty <HI>wou'd not hasten them too much, in Two Decrees of
such Impor∣tance, since the Empress had urg'd some Argu∣ments, to prove
One of them needless; and who cou'd tell, when they came to examine Things
more closely, but they might be mistaken, in Both of 'em?</HI></P>

<P>LITTLE Follies, which we but Smile at in Persons who are Indifferent
to us, gives us Sorrow and Pain, when observ'd in those we Love. <HI>Patty
Amble</HI> is of late become of such Importance, that I watch her with a
Tenderness, that interests me in all her Acti∣ons. For this Reason, I am
frequently con∣triving to interrupt Her, when she lets her Tongue run Races,
that out-gallop her Rea∣son. But I always lose my Labour: My Operations
upon this <HI>Gossip</HI> are like the <HI>Wind's</HI> upon <HI>Fire</HI>;
I may blow till my Breath fails,—instead of <HI>putting her out,</HI> I
make her <HI>burn</HI> but the <HI>faster!</HI></P>
<P>I HAVE succeeded however, in what I fail'd to do <HI>My-self,</HI>
by the Assistance of <HI>Ned Volatile,</HI> But not to assume more
Triumph than is due to me, the Stratagem I made use of, was found out by <HI>Shakespear,</HI> before me. That Poetical Politican taught his <HI>Richard</HI> the Third, among the rest of his surprizing Victories, to
conquer <PB N="103" REF="112"/> a <HI>Woman</HI>'s <HI>Tongue</HI>; but it was
by Aid of one of his <HI>Drums,</HI> which no sooner Beat up, but the Enemy
was put to Silence.</P>
<P>WE shall now enjoy some Freedom, and may all Talk in our Turns;
for <HI>Ned,</HI> and the <HI>Coquet,</HI> will be play'd off at Pleasure.
When either of 'em grows Troublesome, we shall let loose the <HI>Rival,</HI> and like <HI>Sulphur</HI> and <HI>Salt-Petre,</HI> one shall
blow up the other.</P>
<P><HI>PATTY AMBLE</HI> came Yesterday fine∣ly dress'd to the <HI>Assembly</HI>; ready to burst with Impatience for our Admiration of
her Fancy. She kept us Silent above an Hour, while she was so kind as to
open to us the Labours and Difficulties, she had for fourteen Days been <HI>fatigu'd</HI> by, before she cou'd unite so elegant∣ly all her trifling
Varieties. From her Head to her Foot, she oblig'd us with the Minutes of her
whole Fortnight's History. It was not to be expected, that in the midst of
so much Business, she cou'd be at Leisure to consider, That after
we had approv'd both the Price, and Colour of her <HI>Damask,</HI> it was of no
great Edification, at least to the <HI>Male</HI> Part of the Company, to know
what <HI>Shop</HI> she bought it at. But happy had it been cou'd she have
found <HI>Rest</HI> so speedily! Nothing like it, I assure you; we
were also to learn, in what Places she <HI>miss'd</HI> it. Yet for my own
Part, I <HI>must say,</HI> I was particularly <HI>edify'd</HI> by her
cri∣tical Remarks, on certain Differences to be found, betwixt buying on <HI>Ludgate-Hill,</HI> or of the Mercers about <HI>Covent-Garden.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="113"/>BUT ill fare, say I, that unlucky Word <HI>Garden!</HI> It put her fatally in Mind of a Fat fresh-colour'd <HI>Country Lady,</HI> who cou'd never be persuaded to make Visits, in any
thing but <HI>Garden Silks,</HI> tho' her Arms were as big as a <HI>Rolling-Stone!</HI> Then the unfortunate Word <HI>Fat,</HI> brought as
aptly to her Remembrance, poor old <HI>Dimpley</HI> the laughing Staymaker,
that us'd to Work for her <HI>Grandmother,</HI> when first she was Married!
and never <HI>lac'd</HI> our <HI>Patty,</HI> when she was a Girl, but she
made her <HI>very Neck ake</HI> with twisting it to look back at him. At
length, after infinite Disappointments and Dangers, she arriv'd safe at
her <HI>Hoop-Petticoat</HI>; where, being seiz'd with a <HI>Fit</HI> of
Gratitude for the Parliament's <HI>strange good Nature,</HI> and
ex∣traordinary Care of <HI>Trade,</HI> she was <HI>thinking to turn
WHIG,</HI> because they had taken off the <HI>Duty,</HI> that lay so heavy
upon <HI>Whalebone.</HI></P>
<P>WELL, as to that however, she was not al∣together so positive.
But there was one Thing, of more Consequence, that she was absolutely <HI>convinc'd of</HI>; she wou'd venture any <HI>Wager,</HI> that not one
Person in the Company, cou'd be able to <HI>guess,</HI> what her <HI>Ground
Brussels Head</HI> had cost her a Yard; nor where, nor by what particular <HI>odd,</HI> Accident, she had been so hap∣py as to <HI>light of it!</HI>
The Dutchess of <HI>M—r</HI> took Coach in a Fright, the very Moment
she saw it, to buy up the <HI>Remnant.</HI> But since she was sure we <HI>cou'd not guess,</HI> she wou'd tell us the Price <HI>her self</HI>;
and not name one Farthing more or less than it really cost her; she
wonder'd, <PB N="105" REF="114"/> for her Part, how Women cou'd be <HI>so
silly!</HI> For what signify'd after all, the little <HI>Vanity</HI> of
being <HI>thought skill'd in good Penny-worths!</HI> If she had a mind to be <HI>Vain,</HI> she need only believe, what was said to her at the <HI>Opera,</HI> by a <HI>cer∣tain Duke,</HI> who must be nameless! But one
Thing his Grace was pleas'd with, that she <HI>might</HI> venture to speak
of, and it was <HI>that Fancy of her own upon her Fan!</HI> Lord! she
remem∣ber'd too he observ'd, That there was some∣thing in a Lady's <HI>Fan,</HI> much <HI>genteeler in its Use,</HI> than any part of the <HI>Mens Equipage.</HI></P>
<P>IT was just in this Place, that I took Pity of the Company; for I
thought I <HI>felt their Heads ake!</HI> So tipping the Wink on <HI>Ned
Vo∣latile,</HI> he started up from his Chair, with such a <HI>Stare</HI> of
Amazement, that one wou'd have thought he was apprehensive the House had
been falling! The <HI>Coquet</HI> started too, and hold∣ing her Tongue till
she cou'd look round her, <HI>Ned,</HI> with wonderful Agility, snatch'd
the <HI>Nick</HI> of that Interval; and resolving at once to bear down all
Opposition, broke in upon her, like a Torrent, with this sudden
Exclamation, 
<Q REND="inline">'<HI>Ah! Madam! Madam!</HI> What a <HI>Trifle</HI> is
a <HI>Fan,</HI> in Comparison with a <HI>Feather!</HI> I shou'd be sorry
to dissent from any Opinion <HI>you</HI> are fond of; but pray let your
Reason be Judge of this Difference! I have <HI>one,</HI> in my Hat here, that
all the <HI>African Ostriches,</HI> clubbing Tails, to produce the Fellow of
it, might be <HI>moulting</HI> these thousand Years, and all to no
Purpose! Dear Madam, do but look on it! <PB N="106" REF="115"/> The nearer you
examine it, the more it will charm you! With all your <HI>Wit</HI> now, and
your <HI>Industry,</HI> my Life to one of your <HI>Lappits,</HI> it puzzles
you these three Hours to <HI>guess where I bought it?</HI> I can't be
altogether so positive, that you won't hit the <HI>Price</HI> of it; but
upon my Honour, if you <HI>shou'd,</HI> I'll acknowledge it to a Farthing.
There's <HI>some Pleasure</HI> in con∣versing on these <HI>critical
Affairs,</HI> with so nice a Judge as <HI>you, Madam!</HI> Why here's a <HI>Coat,</HI> I have worn this five Weeks, and not one in fifty has had the <HI>Taste</HI> to take Notice, that all the Wool it was made of, is <HI>true
unmix'd Spanish!</HI> You were saying something about <HI>Whalebone:</HI>
'Tis a useful Commodity indeed, as you <HI>Ladies</HI> have manag'd it, but
what are <HI>Hoop Petticoats,</HI> to the <HI>Woollen Manufacture?</HI></Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'FOR Heaven's sake take Breath, cry'd the <HI>Coquet,</HI> (swiftly Fanning herself; and half bursting with a <HI>Windyness,</HI> from Suppression of Meanings,) do but <HI>hear,</HI>
what I was going to say to you?—<HI>Never, never,</HI> reply'd <HI>Ned,</HI> he can never be a good Subject, who sub∣mits to hear any thing
to the Prejudice of the <HI>Woollen Manufacture.</HI> Mark the wonderful
Pro∣gress of this silly thing call'd <HI>Wool,</HI> but from the <HI>Sheep's</HI> Back to <HI>Mine!</HI> Take Notice, in the first Place, of
these few of the <HI>many My∣steries</HI> which depend on this humble
Material! There's the <HI>Grazier</HI> for Example; and the <HI>Shepherd,</HI>

the <HI>Draper,</HI> and the <HI>Taylor,</HI> and the <HI>Packer,</HI> and the <HI>Merchant:</HI> But mention∣ing the Word <HI>Merchant,</HI> I must stop
a little in my Way, and lay open to you the Won∣ders and Advantages of <HI>Navigation!</HI> I shall inform you clearly, and distinctly, under
their proper Heads and Divisions, to what different Corners of the
Universe, <HI>you</HI> Madam, are oblig'd for all those Ornaments which are
adorn'd by you! I will begin like a good Builder, and examine first your <HI>Foundation.</HI> That glittering Pair of <HI>Shoes,</HI> which we can but
see the pointed <HI>Tips</HI> of, had a long and tiresome Journey, to the
prettiest Foot in the <HI>World,</HI> from three most distant Parts of
it. The Silver in their Lacing, you are indebted for to <HI>America.</HI> Now,
you wou'd ask me, as I go along, whence that new Quarter of the Globe took this
Name of <HI>America?</HI> I shall come to it in its Turn; but first you
must be acquainted with the Fortunes of its chief Discoverers, <HI>Spanish, English, French, Por∣tuguese,</HI> and <HI>Hollanders.</HI>
And for clearing Things more effectually to your Apprehen∣sion, I shall,
with as much Brevity as possible, trace the Originals and Histories of
these Nations. But speaking just now of <HI>Silver,</HI> I am presented
by that Means, with a fortunate Opportunity to Sail away with you for <HI>Peru</HI>; and when once I have got you there, we shall never want
Amusements suited to the <PB N="108" REF="117"/> <HI>Mercury</HI> of your
Spirit. For in the first Place, Madam, I will carry you to the Bot∣tom of
those <HI>Mines,</HI> which have enrich'd and embroil'd all <HI>Europe.</HI>
And because I know you are a Lady of most <HI>unsatisfy'd
Curiosity,</HI> I will now anticipate in some measure this Improvement I
design for you; for I will enumerate, in their pro∣per Order, the
Subterraneous Inhabitants of the whole <HI>mineral Kingdom.</HI> There is <HI>Gold,</HI> Madam, and <HI>Silver,</HI> and <HI>Copper,</HI> and <HI>Tin,</HI> and <HI>Quicksilver,</HI> (your Favourite, Madam!) and <HI>Iron,</HI> and <HI>Lead,</HI> and <HI>Antimony,</HI> and <HI>Marchasi∣tes,</HI> and <HI>Lapis Calaminaris,</HI> and <HI>Pyrites,</HI>
and <HI>Vitriol,</HI> and <HI>Allom,</HI> and <HI>Brimstone,</HI> and <HI>Sal

immediate∣ly explain to you the Growth, and the Ope∣rations; and their
strange and distinct Uses, whether in <HI>Science</HI> or in <HI>Trade!</HI> And after∣wards I will take Occasion from this wonder∣ful
Provision of Materials for our Industry, to demonstrate, beyond Denial,
how needless it is for <HI>Man, Woman,</HI> or <HI>Beast,</HI> to live
idle, and unuseful. But <HI>First,</HI> (for I wou'd be Regular) I must
return to your <HI>Shoes.</HI> What I was, in their second Division, to
particula∣rize, was the <HI>Silk,</HI> which they are cover'd with. I dare not
be positive, at this <HI>Distance,</HI> whether it is <HI>Christian</HI>
or <HI>East-Indian</HI>; but I will tell you immediately, when I have
ex∣amin'd it a little <HI>nearer.</HI></Q></P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="118"/><HI>NED</HI> was risen from his Chair, and had
levell'd his Eye at her Foot, when she made her Advantage of the lucky
Opportunity which this <HI>Pause</HI> of his afforded her; and recovering her
lost Ground, renew'd her Charge with a Vigour, that was fatal to her
Opponent.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'<HI>BRAVELY Shot!</HI> cry'd she, laughing, but I
am not so easily to be <HI>scar'd,</HI> I assure you. 'Twill be time
enough to listen to such wise Harangues as yours, after I have talk'd
myself weary. A most <HI>polite</HI> Entertainment indeed you are
designing us! With your greasy Generation of <HI>Scowerers,</HI> and <HI>Wool-Combers!</HI> The Assembly will be better pleas'd with the <HI>intricate Prettinesses,</HI> which are to be learnt in the Art of <HI>Lace-making.</HI> Oh! the dexterous Disposition of the <HI>Cushion,</HI> and the <HI>Pattern,</HI> and the <HI>Pins,</HI> and the <HI>Bobbins</HI>!</Q></P>
<P>SHE set us all to work, but had no sooner entangled us, among her <HI>Threads,</HI> and her <HI>Bobbins,</HI> when she flew on a sudden, out
of that Subject to another; and from that to a third. She led us up, so far
back, that we were present at her Mother's <HI>Labour</HI>; and af∣ter having
been merry at her <HI>Christening,</HI> she took us along with her to her
Nurse's on <HI>Ban∣sted Downs.</HI> From thence to her Father's
Coun∣try-House beyond <HI>Canterbury.</HI> After this we liv'd with her four
Years at a <HI>Boarding School</HI> in <HI>Hackney</HI>; and returning thence,
with Plea∣sure, had the Honour of her Company to the <HI>very first Play
that ever she saw in her Life</HI>; nay, she permitted us to take Part
with her, <PB N="110" REF="119"/> even in the <HI>Masquerade</HI>; and at the <HI>Opera.</HI> But the worst of it was, that, before we were well seated,
we were drawn away in her <HI>Aunt</HI>'s <HI>old Coach,</HI> and carry'd down,
the Lord knows whi∣ther to make Butter and Cheese in <HI>Warwick∣shire.</HI> Yet in this Place, to do her Justice, she kept us
to our no small <HI>Emolument,</HI> for we grew as <HI>good Housewives</HI>
as her <HI>Aunt</HI> was. We all learnt to <HI>Brew</HI> and <HI>fatten
Hogs,</HI> and <HI>feed Poultry.</HI> But what I found most Relishable
were, certain <HI>savoury</HI> Instructions, she was so good as to
communicate; insomuch that I who but yesterday Morning cou'd almost as
easily have made a <HI>Horse,</HI> as a <HI>Pudding,</HI> am to Day a Man
of Learning as well in <HI>Dishes</HI> as their <HI>Garnitures.</HI> I can
read, if I please, when I meet with a Person of <HI>good Taste,</HI> a
long luxurious Lecture on <HI>Farces, Bisks,</HI> and <HI>forc'd Meats,
Ma∣rinades, Puptoons,</HI> and <HI>Olios, Soops, Sauces, Ra∣gousts, Puffs,
Pastry,</HI> and <HI>Pickles, Tarts, Cheese∣cakes,</HI> and <HI>Custards,
Jellies, Conserves,</HI> and <HI>Mar∣malades, Slops, Washes, Pomatums, Cold
Creams,</HI> and <HI>Cordial Waters!</HI></P>
<P>BUT, what was still more obliging, not con∣tent to have enrich'd us
with this profound Knowledge! she was <HI>liberal</HI> enough to talk on,
with such unceasing Rapidity, that we had no Time to <HI>thank</HI> her;
till at length, she saw <HI>Ned Volatile</HI> was preparing to take his
Turn; and rose, and flutter'd her Fan, and scudded out of the <HI>Assembly</HI>; but we heard her Tongue running, all the way down
Stairs, ask∣ing Questions of the Servants, and answering 
<PB N="111" REF="120"/> them herself; and, for any think that I know, she
may be <HI>Talking to this Time,</HI> while I am penning the Narration!</P>
<P>I AM myself too a great <HI>Talker,</HI> only I some∣times love to <HI>listen</HI>; and nothing is so strange to me as that since these <HI>Pratlers</HI> are thus trans∣ported, but by too much Vivacity, that very
Vivacity shou'd not teach 'em to know <HI>when they grow Troublesome!</HI>
I sometimes fancy them like <HI>Horses,</HI> which shutting their Eyes in
their Swiftness, pass the Bounds of their Course, and never stop till
they are beat backward by some Wall which they run their Heads against.</P>

<P>METHINKS I would not miss ranging the <HI>Deformities</HI> of one

Illustra∣tion by Opposites, in Writing, like <HI>Shade</HI> and <HI>Light</HI> in Painting, will make the <HI>Moral</HI> ap∣pear with <HI>Vigour,</HI> and strike upon the <HI>Eye</HI> of the <HI>Understanding</HI> a more forcible <HI>Effect.</HI></P>
<P>COULD I execute this <HI>Design</HI> according to my <HI>Wish</HI>; could I make the <HI>Draught</HI> just, and give it the <HI>Lively Touches</HI> and <HI>warm Colours</HI> it deserves, it might
perhaps be a valuable <HI>Pre∣sent,</HI> and <HI>instructive Family
Piece,</HI> for the mar∣ried Part of my <HI>Readers,</HI> and some of their
Posterity might, for ought I know, have good Reason to thank me for it.</P>
<P>I WAS, according to Custom, opening my Mind upon this intended <HI>Subject</HI> to the worthy Major <HI>Stedfast</HI>; and telling him, That
I should be agreeably lost in Pleasure, while I was tracing, in a good
Father, the secret <HI>Springs</HI> of a Thousand little Beautiful <HI>Actions</HI> which would pass unnoticed by common Eyes, that are too
Incurious and Indelicate on such Nice and Elegant Occasions.</P>
<P>—HERE I paused a while, with Intent to name some particular
Observations, I have made, of these Critical Workings of a <HI>Spirit</HI>
truely <HI>Parentile</HI>; when this constant Friend of Mankind changed my
Inclination to speak, into the greater Pleasure of attending to what he
began to say, in this Manner.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="122"/>THERE is, no fear of your losing yourself in
that Delightful Part of the Contemplation: But when you come to consider the <HI>Unnatural Mother,</HI> I don't know how difficult a Task it may be, even
for all your <HI>Philosophy</HI> to ac∣count for it. You will find yourself
extream∣ly perplexed, if you descend to make Enquiry, what Monstrous Turn
in the whole Course of the Blood, what Prodigies over-ruling the whole
Rational and Animal System, can Eraze from a <HI>Mother's Heart</HI> all
those fond <HI>Records</HI> of <HI>Ten∣derness</HI> which the Hand of
Nature must have engraven there, in behalf of the <HI>Being</HI> which
received its first Principle of <HI>Vitality</HI> so near it, and its
immediate Preservation from it.</P>
<P>YOU may remember that, at your setting out, I told you, the
Expression, which hit my Taste the best of any in your <HI>First</HI>
PAPER, was, <HI>That you would look upon yourself as every Body's
Father;</HI> and I would rather see you acting like a Father, than
describing one: which said he (giving into my Hand a Paper) you may do, by
publishing those <HI>Verses,</HI> which, according to my Opinion, want
nothing more than their being <HI>Known,</HI> in order to their be∣ing <HI>Applauded.</HI></P>
<P>THE Author is a Young Gentleman who, tho' severe Accidents, and the
Rigour of For∣tune have thrown him into the Condition of an <HI>Orphan,</HI> is
still likely to prove a <HI>Fav'rite Son</HI> of the <HI>Muses:</HI> But a
Genius, tho' never so pro∣mising, will not readily make its Way into 
<PB N="114" REF="123"/> Esteem, without the Aid of a Recommender, or the
Encouragement of a Patron.</P>
<P>HERE I read over the <HI>Verses,</HI> and signified my
Approbation, in very few Words, because I perceived the generous <HI>Temper</HI> of the <HI>Ma∣jor</HI> inclin'd him to speak further, in
behalf of <HI>Unfortunate Desert</HI>; when, resuming the Dis∣course,
he proceeded in this Manner.</P>
<P>YOU may guess by this little Performance, That those Talents,
which were not happy enough to procure their Possessor a Compe∣tency,
from <HI>Parents</HI> who liv'd in Affluence, may, if Cultivated and Improved,

<P>THERE is a <HI>Scantiness,</HI> in some Mens Souls, that gives a
distasteful Air to their very Favours, and their Praises; what the <HI>Mien</HI> is to the Body, the <HI>Temper</HI> is to the Mind. And for Want
of this Observation, on Occasi∣ons where it had been most useful,
some have lost their Friends Good-will by an arrogant Manner of <HI>obliging</HI> them; and others <HI>prais'd</HI> Men into a <HI>Contempt</HI> both for their Persons and their Civilities.</P>
<P>THERE must be visible, in those, who wou'd say, or do, Things
engagingly, a certain Sweet∣ness in the Eye, and a Sense of Pleasure in
the Deportment. A Compliment is an <HI>Affront,</HI> when accompany'd with a
sullen Brow, or a negligent, an absent, or supercilious, Behaviour. I
appeal to my Readers, Whether they do not <PB N="118" REF="127"/> always find
themselves uneasy in the Company of a Person, who seems more pleas'd
with <HI>Him∣self,</HI> than with those he is conversing with.</P>
<P>I WAS drawn into this Reflection, by read∣ing, the other Day, a little
Copy of VERSES, which is printed, with some Poetical Pieces of Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s, and was written by a Person of very great Quality, and
whose <HI>Wit, too,</HI> was of the first Mangnitude!</P>

<L>WITH Age decay'd, with Courts and Business tir'd,</L>
<L>Caring for nothing, but what Ease requir'd;</L>
<L>Too dully Serious for the <HI>Muses</HI> Sport,</L>
<L>And, from the Critics, safe arriv'd in Port:</L>
<L>I little thought of launching forth agen,</L>
<L>Amidst advent'rous Rovers of the Pen:</L>
<L>And, after so much undeserv'd Success,</L>
<L>Thus hazarding at last, to make it less.</L>

<L><HI>Ignorance</HI> honour'd, <HI>Wit,</HI> and <HI>Worth</HI>
defam'd,</L>
<L><HI>Folly</HI> triumphant, and ev'n <HI>HOMER</HI> blam'd!</L>

<LG>
<L>But to this Genius, join'd with so much Art,</L>
<L>Such various Learning, mix'd, in every Part,</L>
<L>Poets are bound a loud Applause to pay;</L>
<L><HI>APOLLO</HI> bids it, and they must obey.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And, yet, so wonderful, sublime, a Thing,</L>
<L>As the great <HI>Iliad,</HI> scarce shou'd make <HI>Me</HI>
sing:</L>
<L>Except I justly cou'd, at once commend,</L>
<L>A good Companion, and as firm a Friend.</L>
<L><PB N="119" REF="128"/>One moral, or a mere well-natur'd
Deed,</L>
<L>Does all Desert in Sciences exceed.</L>
<L>'Tis great Delight to laugh at some Mens Ways,</L>
<L>But a much greater, to give Merit <HI>Praise.</HI></L>
</LG>
</LG></Q>
<P>THE good Nature of Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> must be as Extensive, as his
Wit, if his Esteem for this <HI>Noble</HI> Author was not lessen'd, by
so <HI>Ignoble</HI> a Start of his Poetry. It is a grudging, haugh∣ty,
conscious, reluctant, and penurious En∣comium! Under Pretence of Praise to
a Friend, it indulges Spleen to his Enemies. It carries, throughout, a closer
Eye upon <HI>his own</HI> Merit, than upon <HI>His</HI> to whom he
addresses it. In four and twenty Verses, the four odd ones, I <HI>think,</HI> have some faint Inclination to shew Re∣spect to <HI>another</HI>; but the twenty, <HI>I am sure,</HI> with a much stronger
Bent, point directly up∣on <HI>Himself.</HI></P>
<P>WOULD this great Man have applauded such a POET, as he ought, he
shou'd have forgotten, or seem'd to forget, both <HI>Himself,</HI> and
his <HI>Rank,</HI> in that Reverence, so justly due to an Excellence, which
will do Honour to our Nation. He shou'd not have imagin'd himself over
Bountiful in his Condescention: The Praise of Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> will be a
Theme for Wit, and Learning, when all the <HI>Dukes,</HI> his <HI>Patrons,</HI>
shall be <HI>lost</HI> in the Dust that covers them! The accidental
Advantages of Birth, Wealth, and Title, are so far from bestowing Worth,
where they find it not originally, that they serve but to make the Want of it
more <PB N="120" REF="129"/> obvious and contemptible; whereas a <HI>Genius</HI>
like this Gentleman's, surmounts all the sha∣dowy Superiorities of Fortune,
adorns Dignity itself, and makes Obscurity illustrious!</P>
<P>THE great <HI>Cardinal Richelieu,</HI> in a Circum∣stance of like
Nature, acted in so different a Manner, that I am always charm'd afresh,
when I read over a Letter, which he sent to <HI>Balzac</HI> a <HI>French</HI>
Writer, whose Merit was as inferior to Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s, as the Grandeur
of the <HI>Prime Minister</HI> was superior to the <HI>Nobleman</HI>'s: Let

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THO' I have often, and openly, declar'd what I think of your
Writings, yet can∣not I satisfy my self without sending you, by this
Letter, a more <HI>Authentic</HI> Approba∣tion: I never had any particular
Affection for your Person, and since, therefore, it is the Prerogative of <HI>Truth,</HI> that compels me to my Opinion, I will take care, That the
Esteem, I profess for your Works, shall be no <HI>barren Compliment</HI>;
for my Praise shall be seconded by the <HI>Applause</HI> of a whole <HI>People.</HI></P>
<P>Or, if, notwithstanding my Endeavours, some low Spirits shall
be found, who may affect to think otherwise, Time will make them but too
sensible, that the Faults, they <PB N="121" REF="130"/> impute to <HI>You,</HI> are Defects in their own Judgment. They are like People in the <HI>Jaundice,</HI> who see every Thing of that dis∣temper'd Colour, which
themselves are af∣flicted by.</P>
<P>IN the Days of our Ancestors, Persons of narrow Understanding
were implicite Ad∣mirers of what was above their Comprehen∣sion; but now, by
a kind of <HI>Elasticity</HI> in modern Reason, Judgment <HI>extends</HI>
or <HI>contracts</HI> itself, to sit close upon our <HI>Capacity</HI>;
and we approve, but just as far, as we are able to understand; blasting
every Thing by our Censure, that we cannot reach by our Practice. Yet I hope,
I do not presume too much, when I say concerning your Works, That <HI>I
see Things as they are,</HI> and <HI>declare 'em</HI> what I <HI>see</HI>
them. Your Conceptions are strong, and the Flight of your Imagination
outsoars every Thing but your Reason: Your Language is pure, and your
Expression strongly Elegant.</P>
<P>I WILL conclude with this Caution; That you will be guilty in the
Eye of God, if you suffer such a Pen to <HI>rest</HI>; or if you <HI>em∣ploy</HI> it too <HI>idly.</HI> You ought to apply your∣self
henceforward, to grave and important Subjects; and I am content that you
shall impute to <HI>Me,</HI> all the <HI>Blame,</HI> if, when you do so,
you receive not the Returns, which will be due to you. Already I am medita∣ting
an Opportunity to be known for</P>

</LETTER>
<P><PB N="122" REF="131"/>I AM transported, while I read this Letter, at
the flaming Intermixture of this Statesman's lovely Qualities! What a Glow of
Humanity! What a Consciousness of that Care, which is the Duty of the <HI>Great,</HI> to draw up Merit, out of Obscurity! What a Knowledge of a
State's true Interest, from the Force of such Examples! What a genteel <HI>Magnanimity!</HI> What a spirited Race of Sweetness, does there
shine, in this short Letter!</P>
<P>IT is pleasant enough to remark, That both the <HI>French</HI>
Encomium and the <HI>English,</HI> had Effects, the very Reverse of what
was intend∣ed by their Authors; yet, at the same Time, strictly consonant
with <HI>Justice,</HI> and their diffe∣rent Merits; while the <HI>English</HI> Applauder ad∣dresses to Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> the Praise
he <HI>means</HI> to <HI>Him∣self</HI>; his Verses are never read without
lessen∣ing his own Character; whereas, the generous <HI>French
Cardinal,</HI> meaning nothing in his Let∣ter, but the Encouragement of <HI>Monsieur Bal∣zac,</HI> draws that Honour on his own Name, which he wou'd
bestow upon another's; and becomes <HI>Himself,</HI> the <HI>Reader's
Idol,</HI> while he is pointing him where to worship!</P>
<P>IT was impossible for <HI>Monsieur Balzac,</HI> after being thus
nobly distinguish'd, not to strain his Genius to the utmost, to keep
Possession of a Glory, he must so justly have been Proud of;
whereas <HI>Neglect,</HI> on the other Hand, has dis∣courag'd a thousand
Spirits, which might have been capable, had they been <HI>Fortunate,</HI> or
sup∣ported by those who were so, to shine out <PB N="123" REF="132"/> as <HI>living Lights,</HI> and illustrate the Age, they were born in, thro' a
long Course of Futuri∣ty. <HI>Camoens,</HI> whom the <HI>Portuguese</HI>
call the <HI>Virgil</HI> of <HI>their</HI> Country, has touch'd this Sub∣ject
very happily, in the 5th Book of his <HI>Lusiad.</HI></P>
<Q> 
<L>HOW sweet is Praise, and justly purchas'd Glory,</L> 
<L>By our own Actions, when to Heaven they soar!</L> 
<L>Each noble Soul will <HI>Strain,</HI> to leave his Story,</L> 
<L>An Overmatch for all who climb'd before.</L> 
<L>Those wond'rous Heights, <HI>Achilles</HI> reach'd in Arms,</L> 
<L>Had ne'er so strongly mov'd the World's great Lord,</L> 
<L>Had not the Muse of <HI>Homer</HI> giv'n 'em Charms,</L> 
<L>And rows'd him from a <HI>Rest,</HI> he, thence, abhorr'd.</L>

<P>MY Old Maid, who has liv'd with me these thirty Years, and claims
the <HI>tuck∣ing me up,</HI> as a Privilege annex'd to her <HI>Office</HI>;
left open my Window-curtains last Night, <PB N="125" REF="134"/> which so
early let in the Beams of the Sun upon me, that I was wak'd from a Dream, which
I cou'd have wish'd to enjoy much longer.</P>
<P>FANCY had remov'd all my Distance from Youth; and given me back
those gentle Flames, which warm and brighten Life in its <HI>Morning.</HI> I
saw an adorable Object, which my Soul, me∣thought, had once been
passionately fond of: And of whose Perfections I imagin'd myself to
have been vertuously enamour'd: But I had lost her, as I fancy'd, in <HI>Death.</HI> Oh! the Pain of that Imagination was terrible even in Sleep! I
saw this lovely Person, adorn'd with all her Sweetness! I heard the
Musick of her Accents, informing me, she was <HI>my PATTY.</HI> Now grown
kinder and more sensible, I even <HI>felt</HI> her leaning over me; and
found the animat∣ing Influence of her Soul-enchanting Pressures! With what
Ecstasy of Fondness did I survey her lovely Languor! Her Eyes were
melting∣ly relax'd; and their Beams serenely temper'd with angelick
Softness and Compassion. Her very <HI>Soul</HI> seem'd to shine upon
me, through the Smile of every Feature. Oh! how beau∣tiful is a chast
Passion! How sweetly does it remain upon the Mind, and appeal from <HI>Death</HI> to the <HI>Memory!</HI> I never knew, till this dear Dream
convinc'd me, what I lost by not lov∣ing, while my <HI>Body,</HI> as well as
my <HI>Soul,</HI> cou'd have done Justice to the Passion.</P>
<P>WHILE I was thus tenderly employ'd, I wish some Artist cou'd
have snatch'd my Pic∣ture! Old as I am, I flatter myself, That Love 
<PB N="126" REF="135"/> wou'd have lent it Lustre. I wou'd have all my
Friends, who <HI>are not,</HI> resolve immediate∣ly, to commence <HI>Lovers.</HI> The Insipids, who have never <HI>lov'd,</HI> may be said
to live as the Greedy <HI>drink</HI>; they <HI>swallow</HI> Life without <HI>tast∣ing</HI> it.</P>
<P>BUT, all transported as I was, with this charming Dream, it was
ravish'd from me, by the Sun. Yet did I not <HI>complain.</HI> It had tun'd
my Soul to Harmony; and transform'd me from an Old <HI>Philosopher,</HI> into
a young and hap∣py <HI>Wanton!</HI> I started from my Bed, and flew with
Vigour to the Glass! to which I have long accustom'd myself to creep
without Transport. Old and Worm-eaten as it is in every Part of its broad
Frame, yet did it not alarm me. I even saw my own Face in it without the
least Mortification. Nay, I took Notice, That my Night-cap was not so White
as it ought to have been; which in more unpolite Hours, I shou'd have thought
not worth remarking. But <HI>Love</HI> adorns and improves us! My Bo∣som
swell'd with Sighs, and my Eyes shone with Pleasure. I brush'd up my <HI>Mouse-colour</HI> Gloves, and was wishing they had been <HI>Yellow
ones.</HI> I powder'd my short Hair; and comb'd it down to look longer. Nay I
almost arriv'd at the Foppery of spoiling my new <HI>Beaver,</HI> by
inflicting the modern <HI>Pinch</HI> on it. At length I remember'd, That my
Youth was but a <HI>Dream!</HI> And my <HI>PATTY</HI> a <HI>COQUET!</HI> My
Arms, at this Thought, folded sadly upon my Breast; I sunk into my easy
Chair, and was, some <PB N="127" REF="136"/> Minutes, quite <HI>lost</HI>
there, before I cou'd recover myself. How dreadful is the Descent, from
airy Pleasure to substantial Misery! It is not to be describ'd in
Prose, and since <HI>LOVE</HI> both deserves good Poetry, and can
inspire it, let me see what my <HI>Muse</HI> will say to it.</P>
<Q> 
<L>Oh! Lovely Object! Whose dear Form I keep,</L> 
<L>In busy Daylight and in silent Sleep!</L> 
<L>Revisit Fancy—to my Sighs attend;</L> 
<L>Thou <HI>imag'd Shadow</HI> of my Soul's soft Friend!</L> 
<L>When I recall thy Beauties to my Mind,</L> 
<L>How <HI>dead</HI> are all Things thou hast left behind!</L> 
<L>Study, Pride, Friendship, languish for thy Sake;</L> 
<L>Oh! Why did <HI>Love</HI> from thy sweet Tomb awake?</L> 
<L>Why <HI>move</HI> his pointed Arrows in my Breast,</L> 
<L>In Life's Descent, and the cool <HI>Vale</HI> of <HI>Rest!</HI></L> 
<L>Oh! charm not thus my <HI>Soul,</HI> which is design'd</L> 
<L>To <HI>flow</HI> down <HI>Time,</HI> and strengthen Humankind!</L></Q>
<P>WELL! My Readers shou'd think as I do, that all Things are for the <HI>Best.</HI> I lost my Dream, and they find a Poet. The Witlings will
say, a <HI>dreaming</HI> one! But Melancholy has its Charms, and I am <HI>sweetly Sad,</HI> in the Re∣membrance of it.</P>
<P>WHILE I was indulging this mournful Tenderness, I heard a gentle Rap
at my Door, as if it fear'd to alarm me; and the Outside of it seem'd to be
swept by the rustling of Silk; a Musick I am not us'd to! I open'd it
slow∣ly, for I was still lost to myself; and was ad∣dress'd by a <HI>Lady</HI> in a modest but most en∣chanting <PB N="128" REF="137"/>
Manner. She appear'd to be near thirty; and was dress'd, very gravely, a
little remov'd from the present <HI>Mode.</HI> But my Heart sprung within
me! For all the Beauties of my Vision were more than verify'd in this <HI>Reality!</HI> The Soul of a <HI>God</HI> seem'd to stream through her
Eyes! And the Ideas of her Wit and Majestick Understanding <HI>flam'd</HI>
and <HI>sparkled</HI> in her <HI>meaning Softness!</HI> There was
something in her Air, that made the Room seem to <HI>blaze</HI> round her!
I led her to my great Chair, but she gracefully declin'd it, and seated
herself at some Distance, not to shew the Re∣spect she had, to my <HI>Age,</HI> I hope, but my <HI>Writings:</HI> After a Preface, of the
sweetest Praise, that Vanity cou'd wish to hear, she took a Paper
from her Bosom; and seem'd to tremble, while she gave it me, as if it
enclo∣se'd some Declaration, that her <HI>Heart</HI> was con∣cern'd in. How
becoming is <HI>Humility,</HI> when such Excellence condescends to wear
it!—She withdrew: and, from her <HI>Manner,</HI> I open∣ed her Paper with
Impatience; and found in it what follows.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>Good SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WAIT on you, with my own Letter, from the Respectful Desire I
have to see the Person of him, whose Soul I so much admire, in the
PLAIN DEALER. I knew very well, That the Reverence you must in∣spire, wou'd
prevent my speaking freely, and <PB N="129" REF="138"/> I chose therefore,
to <HI>write,</HI> what I wished to inform you of.</P>
<P>I WAS the other Day, in an Assembly, of what the World calls <HI>fine Ladies</HI>; to which gay Part of our Species I have lately been a
Stranger, so that I found their Dress, and their Conversation entirely
Foreign to me; though, (through all Disguises) I could dis∣cover the <HI>British Beauty!</HI>—The Con∣fusion of their Fans, and the
Loudness of their Laughter, alarm'd, and oppress'd my Ear; as the new
Situation of their Elbows drew my Eye under Astonishment! One of the
Ladies, who, I fear for her own sake, is what they call a <HI>Toast,</HI>
was, most lamenta∣bly, delighted with a young Gentleman, who sat next her,
and who by the Oddness of his Dress, surpriz'd me, more than the Ladies
did.—His Wig, instead of gracefully adorning his Shoulders, was tuck'd
up into a Bag, of the same <HI>Content</HI> with his Head; and had two Wings
shooting from it; so that he look'd like a <HI>Mercury revers'd.</HI> The
lit∣tle Hair, that escap'd this Bag, (because no Hat was allowed to
shield it) was cemented by Oil and Powder; to secure it against
Tempest. The Sleeve of his Coat had re∣mov'd the Middle of his Arm, from the
Place I should have look'd for it in, and <HI>preferr'd</HI> the Bend of his
Elbow, to within three Inches of his Shoulder. His Stockings were so high
embroider'd, that they left no Shape to his <PB N="130" REF="139"/> Leg: And his
Hands, to his Fingers Ends, were <HI>entomb'd,</HI> in a Pair of Ruffles. He
was button'd up to the Chin, in a white Dimmity Waistcoat; and wore a Frock,
which, I sup∣pose, he borrow'd from one of his Grooms, to emulate the <HI>Jockey Air</HI> with the more Ele∣gance, and Propriety.</P>
<P>AS odd a Creature as this was, he seem'd to consider <HI>Me</HI>
as an <HI>Odder</HI>; for I over-heard him whisper his fair Neighbour, That,
by my Ill Dress, and my Neglect of the Company, I must be either a <HI>Wit,</HI> or a <HI>Tory!</HI> It was plain, he said, from my Behaviour,
that I was unlearned in the new World, and he fancied, for his Part, that I
dropt out of the <HI>Eclipse,</HI> last <HI>Monday</HI>!—The
Favourite Lady oblig'd him with a tender Look; and burst into a loud
Laughter. I found that all his Discourse was fill'd with Arrogance, and
Folly; and a Monster bred of both, which they call <HI>Double Entendres.</HI>
At last, he hum'd half a Tune; danc'd a Step or two, to his own Musick;
took <HI>Snuff</HI> and <HI>Leave</HI> to∣gether; and <HI>hopt</HI> out of the
Company.</P>
<P>The Ladies were now at Leisure to look a little at me. But their
Hearts seem'd strangely full of this ridiculous Object, whom they
immediately fell a praising, with a kind of miserable Emulation. Mr. <HI>Flushcheek,</HI> said the <HI>Toast,</HI> is, sure! the most
delightful Crea∣ture! the finest, and best-bred Gentleman! how witty! how
tender! how polite and <PB N="131" REF="140"/> how <HI>severe,</HI> he is! He
is the Soul of Sense, and Gallantry; and the very Life of the <HI>Masquerade:</HI> I started, at their Admiration; and felt my Heart
sink into Pity for 'em; while I contemplated, in Silence, the Perfecti∣on of
my adorable <HI>Bellario.</HI></P>
<P>OH! Mr. PLAIN DEALER! that I had pro∣per Language to convey him to
your Ima∣gination! You wou'd then approve my Pas∣sion: And I shou'd be
justify'd even to your <HI>Reason.</HI> His Person is divinely form'd,
Tall and Graceful! His Eyes, which are full of Wisdom, wear a <HI>Gentleness,</HI> as if they griev'd their own Lustre, and were willing
to <HI>decline</HI> themselves in Pity to the Beholders! His Lips are rarely
open'd but to <HI>praise</HI> or to <HI>improve,</HI> though he has Teeth,
which he might be proud of shewing. There is, in the Turn of his Arms, an
inexpressible Air of Majesty! I never look on him without <HI>seeing</HI> all the great Men, I have read of. I trem∣ble before him,
with a kind of <HI>religious Pas∣sion!</HI> For Religion and Virtue are
adorn'd by his Conversation! So that I may say, without Falshood, that it
is <HI>Heaven</HI> to <HI>hear</HI> him! His Dress is disengag'd; and he <HI>knows</HI> all Things but, that he is charming! Oh! that you were
acquainted with his Mind, which is shining with every Virtue! Amidst the
Throng of his Beauties, I forgot to tell you, That he is a <HI>Poet,</HI> a
most <HI>Divine</HI> one! Believe me it is no <HI>Fiction!</HI> Place him
there∣fore <PB N="132" REF="141"/> before Mr. <HI>Flushcheek</HI>'s Eyes; and
con∣vert his fair Admirers: for they take in the PLAIN DEALER.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub"><DATE>FRIDAY, <HI>May</HI> 22. 1724.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>I FELL asleep, the other Night, after medi∣tating, in my Bed, on our
general Dissa∣tisfaction, at the Fortune that is alloted us; and had,
again, an extraordinary Dream, but <PB N="133" REF="142"/> very different from
my last; and so strongly distinct, and entertaining, that I flatter
myself, my <HI>Readers</HI> will be glad to share its Impression, while
it is new, upon my Memory.</P>
<P>I WAS plac'd, I knew not how, on the Top of a green Hill; which was
very flow'ry, and fragrant. The World, methought, lay under it, in a vast
Descent of Cloudiness! A thousand Roads led up to it; but, with such
intricate, and mazy Windings, that my Eye was unable to trace any of them,
distinctly: Yet they, all, open'd at last, upon the Summit of the Hill, and
pour'd out a mix'd Multitude, of both Sexes, and of all Ages, and Conditions;
who, as soon as they had reach'd the Flat, hasten∣ed forward towards its
Center.</P>
<P>I WAS wonderfully pleas'd, to discover <HI>Patty Amble,</HI> in the
Crowd; and, giving her my Hand, led her on, with great Composure. She
inform'd me, That the Place we were up∣on, was the <HI>Mount of Fortune</HI>;
and, That she was going to a <HI>Fair,</HI> which is held on it, and call'd, <HI>Mend-all Market.</HI> Her Business, she said, was to change her
Condition, for a Bet∣ter; and, she doubted not, but I might do the same, if
I pleas'd, since I had found my Way, up the Hill. For all People, who came
thither, were allow'd the happy Privilege, to lay down their own Burdens; and
take up lighter, in the Room of them.</P>
<P>IN the very middle of the Plain, we came, at length, to a kind of <HI>May-Pole,</HI> which was bigger than the <HI>Monument</HI>; and as high as
the <PB N="134" REF="143"/> <HI>Pike</HI> of <HI>Teneriff:</HI> It was of a
bright <HI>Yellow,</HI> or <HI>Gold-colour</HI>; but twinkled, strangely, at
a Distance; and looked dazling, and transparent. There hung, off from it,
all about, lovely Garlands, of precious Stones, with a Mixture of the
sweetest Flowers; the <HI>Hues</HI> of which were <HI>changeable,</HI> and
varied every Moment, with a most bewitching Delightfulness. Upon the
Pinacle of this Pyramid, sat the Goddess of the Place, very busily
spinning: But the Thread she twisted off, was too <HI>fine,</HI> to be
seen, distinct∣ly, by Us, who stood, so far, below it. The Wheel, in
its Motion, made a musical Sound; but so rough, and so loud, that it
shook the Hill, all round it. It scatter'd, while she turn'd it, a
sparkling Shower of <HI>Globules,</HI> that were many-colour'd, but hollow;
and broke, like empty Bubbles, in their descending over the Multitude.</P>
<P>WHAT I observ'd, with most Concern, was, that, the nearer we came,
the Prospect grew less charming; for the Dust was so thick, that our
Eyes, and Mouths, were filled with it; and our Heads ak'd with the Bustle,
and the Noise, of the Tumult. The Commodities, which were to be barter'd for,
lay, spread, every where, in Heaps; and All, who pass'd between, were
invited to come, and cheapen them.—<HI>Sweet∣meats, Limonades,</HI> and
Variety of the finest <HI>Fruits,</HI> were offer'd, diligently, up and down,
by little <HI>Cupids,</HI> with painted Baskets: And Trumpeters, Jugglers,
Rope-dancers, <HI>Merry-Andrews,</HI> and <HI>Opera-Mongers,</HI> were exerting
<PB N="135" REF="144"/> themselves, on all Sides, to compleat the Up∣roar of
the Market. But, tho' I pass'd by all their <HI>Stages,</HI> I saw no more
than <HI>Two,</HI> whose Faces were well known to me; and Those were, <HI>Heidegger,</HI> and <HI>Doctor Faustus.</HI></P>
<P>IN the Front of every Pile, rose an <HI>Alabaster Pillar,</HI>
whereon hung a Picture, fill'd with Figures, all in <HI>Motion</HI>;
representing whatever was most tempting, and desirable, in the
Mer∣chandize it recommended. And, at the Foot of each Pillar, was placed an <HI>Ebony Chair</HI>; on both Sides of which, stood young, and beau∣tiful
Women, dress'd like <HI>Muses</HI> and <HI>Graces:</HI> Some inviting
Passengers to take Possession of the Empty Seat; and others
pointing up, to a Compartment, on the Top of it, where was to be read, in
golden Letters, the Name, and Quality, of the Merchandize.</P>
<P>WE made up, to a Heap, that was remark∣ably higher than the Rest;
and read, there, the Word <HI>ROYALTY.</HI> We were agreeably surpriz'd, to
see, moving, in the Picture, that hung upon this Pillar, <HI>Armies,
Palaces,</HI> and <HI>Navies!</HI> Crowds of Men, upon their Knees; and Women,
still more prostrate!—Banquets, Treasures, Sports, and Triumphs,
all succeed∣ing, in their Turns, drew a mighty Crowd of Gazers; who were
struggling for the Chair, and push'd each other from it. <HI>Patty
Amble</HI> was very earnest, to have had <HI>me</HI> put in for it: But I
wink'd upon her, to be quiet; and pre∣sently, we saw a Person, breaking
strong∣ly through the Crowd; who, with loud <PB N="136" REF="145"/> <HI>Huzza</HI>'s, and Concurrence, plac'd him, there, and bow'd round
him.—But, no sooner was he seated, when the tempting Figures, in the
Picture, chang'd, immediately, into <HI>horrible</HI> Ones!—Cares,
Dangers, Hatred, Restless∣ness, and a thousand <HI>sooty Furies,</HI>
roll'd, un∣quietly, about him! The <HI>Muses,</HI> and <HI>Graces,</HI> were
transform'd into <HI>Serpents,</HI> and <HI>Satyrs!</HI> that hiss'd,
grinn'd, and pointed at him. And, when he wou'd have, gladly, escap'd, and
sprung out of the Chair, he found himself held down in it, by a Troop of <HI>meagre Phan∣toms,</HI> that frighted us away, from any further
Observation of him.</P>
<P>THE next Place, that we stopp'd at, was the Column of BEAUTY. We
look'd up, to the Picture, and saw, moving, in it, a mix'd, and confus'd
Bustle, of Coaches, Footmen, and Coronets: Men, with their Hearts in their
Hands; and an indistinct Cavalcade, of shape∣less Things, without Heads,
call'd Smiles, Sighs, Vows, Desires, Faintings, Languishments, and
Adorations. There came, up, to this Place, in great Hurry, a fat, but
sprightly, Young Woman, with a Bundle, under her Arm; which she laid down,
by Way of Bar∣ter; and which, we observ'd, as she sorted the Goods, to be
fill'd with large Legs, red Hair, brown Skin, big Breasts; and
Small-Pox-Marks, in abundance. The Attendants, at the Pillar, having agreed to
the Exchange, were inviting her into the <HI>Ebony</HI> Chair; when I, who, by
this Time, began to suspect their fair Appear∣ance, <PB N="137" REF="146"/> <HI>turn'd</HI> the Picture, with my <HI>Stick:</HI> and expos'd its other Side
to the <HI>She-Merchant</HI>; which was to be Part of her Bargain, and
con∣sisted of Scandal, Spleen, Jealousy, Anguish, Perjury, and Ruin.
She no sooner saw the Faces of this ugly Nest of Monsters, but,
snatching up her own Bundle, she ran, as fast as her thick Legs cou'd
carry her; tumbling, Head over Heels, at every Heap in her Way; and getting up,
as she best cou'd; without staying, to look behind her.</P>
<P>WHILE we were diverting ourselves, at this pleasant Flight, a
Person, whom Nature had design'd, and limb'd, for a <HI>PLOWMAN,</HI> had
been seiz'd with an Ambition to be made a <HI>Minister of State</HI>; and,
having thrown down his Burden, of Toil, Penury, and Dirtiness be∣fore the
Pillar of POWER, had seated himself, triumphantly, in the Chair, at the
Foot of it; but was frighted out of his Wits, by that time we came up to him;
for we found him al∣most smother'd, under an unmerciful Load of Slanders,
Terrors, Axes, and Halters; which he had much ado to crawl out from; and was
bawling, with great Earnestness, and Distortion of Muscles, to have his <HI>Own Goods</HI> restor'd him.</P>
<P>IN the next Compartment we examin'd, we found written the Word,
TITLES. We saw, there, a Beau, with six Footmen behind him, very
earnestly perusing the moving Trophies, in the Picture. My <HI>Coquet</HI>
felt her Heart beat, at the Sight of so fine a Gentleman; and whis∣per'd 
<PB N="138" REF="147"/> her Opinion, That I need not turn <HI>that</HI> Picture;
for sure! there was no <HI>Ill</HI> to be ap∣prehended, <HI>there</HI>;—I did it, however, and the Beau fell into Fits; at the
sudden rushing out of a Whirlwind of Ignorance, Conceited∣ness, Scorn,
Luxury, and Diseases!</P>
<P>I frighted an honest Citizen, in much the same Manner, from the
Standard of WEALTH. He had taken a Fancy for Preferment: and was wishing,
extremely, to be erected into an <HI>Alderman!</HI>—He had counted out,
for the Pur∣chase, a Life-full of Ease; a small Parcel of
Understanding; and <HI>Ditto,</HI> of Conscience. But, the very Minute I
turn'd the Picture, there flew, into his Face, Dullness, Cuckoldom, and
Clumsiness! upon which he took to his Heels, and left his <HI>own Bag</HI>
behind him.</P>
<P>AT the Column of WIT, I was agreeably entertain'd, among a large
Circle of <HI>Gapers,</HI> who were admiring the wonderful <HI>Mechanism</HI>
of the Picture, that was hung upon that Pillar.—Cities, Mountains,
Oceans, Woods, Skies, Meadows, Gardens, Gods, and Goddesses, Gi∣ants,
Mermaids, Cupids, Dragons, Mistresses, Witches, Enchanted Castles,
Fields of Air; and Seas of Fire; all, delightfully, intermix'd, and confounded,
rose, and charm'd the Obser∣vation!—But the Crowd dispers'd,
immedi∣ately, on my discovering, to their great Ter∣ror, and Amazement, that
there lurk'd, behind all this Gaiety, a <HI>lean</HI> Society, call'd Envy,
Malice, Poverty, Dependence, and Calamity!</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="148"/>I WALK'D quite through the <HI>Fair</HI>; and,
where-ever I wander'd, perceived it was, in all Parts, alike. They, who brought <HI>Complaints,</HI> to exchange, against <HI>Good-Fortune,</HI> chose to
carry their <HI>own</HI> back again, rather than con∣clude a <HI>New</HI>
Bargain. There was something, in every Heap, that they were inclinable enough
to purchase;—But there was some∣thing too, that must go with it,
which they could not bear to be troubled with: so, they went murmuring, away;
and bestow'd their Curses, in great Plenty, on the Goddess, who kept the
Market; which was never the thinner, notwithstanding; for, still, new
Crowds sup∣ply'd the Places of those, who return'd, dis∣satisfy'd. Nor
cou'd the Warnings they met with, from such Numbers who had been
dis∣appointed, prevail with these new Comers, to believe, they shou'd go
back again, without being the Richer, from a <HI>Mart,</HI> that was stor'd,
so plentifully, with all, that the World calls Valuable.</P>
<P>AMONG the infinite Variety of Temptati∣ons, which glitter'd, every
where, about me, I was in Danger but once; and That was, at the Pillar of FAME.
I saw, when I turn'd that Picture, that the Weight of the Counter-balance
lay, chiefly, in these four Evils,—<HI>Death, Time, Detraction,</HI>
and <HI>Uncertainty!</HI> Yet, so strong was my Desire to float my Name
through Futurity, that I was resolutely deter∣min'd to take
Possession of the Chair.—But, having Nothing of Value about me,
but my <PB N="140" REF="149"/> <HI>Oaken Stick,</HI> and <HI>Mouse-colour'd
Gloves,</HI> (the first of which they refus'd, because of the Mischief it
had done 'em, in turning up the wrong Sides of their Pictures; and the Second,
be∣cause not <HI>fine</HI> enough to be fashionable, in that Region,) I was
forc'd upon an Expedient, which I am almost afraid to confess, for fear of
losing, for ever, the Good Opinion of my Female Readers.</P>
<P>TO say all, in a Word, I was, heroically, resolv'd, to give up my <HI>Love</HI> for my <HI>Glory</HI>; so, taking <HI>Patty Amble</HI> by the
Hand, I prof∣fer'd <HI>Her,</HI> in Barter, (having no <HI>Other
Com∣modity.</HI>) The Attendants, who watch'd the Pillar, were just ready to
take hold of her; when she threw her Arms about my Neck, and <HI>conjur'd</HI> me, by all the Tyes, of Honour, and of Gallantry, that I
wou'd not leave her, a Sa∣crifice, to so empty a Divinity, as the Regent of
that Mountain! She begg'd, that I wou'd return, with her, to the Lower, but
happier World: and, whatever I should ask of her, she wou'd grant me, by
Way of Recompence. I took her suddenly, at her Word, and ask'd her <HI>Heart</HI> for a <HI>Fairing.</HI>—Nay, spare me but that One
Thing, said she, with a languishing Re∣proachfulness, and take <HI>any
thing else, about me.</HI></P>
<P>Unfortunately overjoy'd, at this Bliss, which, methought, befel me,
the sudden Flow of my Spirits, under a Sense of the promis'd Transport,
caus'd so violent an Agitation, that, waking on a sudden, I dropt, out of
her Arms, and per∣ceiv'd myself in my Bed, in <HI>Barbican.</HI></P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub"><DATE>MONDAY, <HI>May</HI> 25. 1724.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>I PASS some agreeable Hours, now and then, at the House of <HI>Sir
Portly Rufus,</HI> an old and wealthy Acquaintance; who lives, a few Miles, out
of Town; and having got his Estate, by a long and busy Life, spent in
Trading, adventurously, to most Parts of the World, is, now, retir'd from
its Hurry; and enjoys it with a graceful Ease, and unde∣signing
Hospitality. The only Inconvenience, I have to complain of, when I am with
him, is, that the Company I meet there, is not so Delicate as I cou'd wish
it; but mix'd with that Ineligance, which must be expected, and submitted
to, among Men of Business: whose Friendships are form'd, for the most
Part, not on Sympathy of Minds; but mutual Commerce of Interests.</P>
<P>YET, as there is, always, something to be <HI>learnt,</HI> from the
most inconsiderable Accidents we can meet with, I never return'd from
Dine∣ing, or Supping, with my good Friend <HI>Sir</HI> <PB N="142" REF="151"/> <HI>Portly,</HI> but I brought away with me as strong a Proof, as I cou'd any
where have met with, That the Reason why, in mix'd Com∣panies, we seldom
find much Pleasure, is, be∣cause every Person, not under some immediate
Guard of <HI>Hope, Fear,</HI> or <HI>Reverence,</HI> keeps only <HI>Himself</HI> in View: And directs his Dis∣course, and Behaviour, <HI>not</HI> to the Taste of those he shou'd Entertain; but to the
parti∣cular Bent of his own Humour, or Capacity.</P>
<P>ONE of the most constant Guests, at <HI>Sir Portly</HI>'s, is <HI>Tony Gingle</HI> his Sister's Son; who has a great Genius for Poetry. He
makes very good Verses, and pronounces, gracefully enough, those he
repeats, from other Writers,—so far, all is well. But the worst of it
is, that <HI>Tony</HI> has studied nothing, <HI>but</HI> Poetry. He is quite
dark in the useful Doctrine of Times, Seasons, and Places. It is the same
Thing to <HI>him,</HI> when the Muse <HI>bites,</HI> whether he quotes
Tragedy, to a Man of Letters, his Taylor's Wife, or a Stockjobber. The Chimes
of his Numbers are for ever, ringing in his Fancy: And all, who chance to sit
near him, must have their Share of the Melody. He has taken it into his Head,
that, because <HI>he</HI> can make a considerable Figure, <HI>as a
Poet,</HI> there is nothing, considerable, <HI>but Poetry!</HI> And it is a
very pleasant Scene to observe <HI>Tony,</HI> studying, at one of the
Tables of a full Coffee-House, in the midst of the City; scanning
Verses, on his Fingers: Conceiving, writing, and blotting out: And humming
them over, to himself, <PB N="143" REF="152"/> with all the Rapture, and
Gesticulation, of <HI>Tone, Action,</HI> and <HI>Passion!</HI>
Regardless that he is star'd at, and remark'd, all the while, by a dozen or
two of thriving Citizens; who shake their Heads and <HI>pity</HI> him, as a
Man, that has <HI>lost</HI> his <HI>Wits</HI>; even while he is under the <HI>Ope∣ration</HI> of being <HI>Witty!</HI>—He has never per∣mitted his
Brain to grow cool enough to re∣flect, That <HI>Wit,</HI> in dull Company, is
the dullest Subject in the World; and that it is a Folly, to talk of <HI>Homer, Horace,</HI> or <HI>Pope,</HI> among Grave Fellows within <HI>Ludgate</HI>; who, when they hear of a Great Poet, will tell you a Story of <HI>Tom Brown</HI>; and feel no Difference in the Power of <HI>Tony
Gingle</HI>'s own Works, and the humble La∣bours of their <HI>Bellman.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Jack Juniper,</HI> the Apothecary; and <HI>Tom Tiresome,</HI>
the Haberdasher, living both in the same Street, ride down together, twice
a Week, to take a Bottle, with my Friend, <HI>Sir Portly.</HI>—<HI>Jack
Juniper</HI> reads us Lectures, on the new Improvements in <HI>Botany,</HI> and
the Rise, and Progress of <HI>Inoculation,</HI> which are, accurately,
answer'd, by Mr. <HI>Thomas Tiresome</HI>; with the Price of the <HI>Stocks</HI>; and the Mournful Decay of the <HI>Spittle-fields
Weaving.</HI>—As soon as this very able Apothecary has open'd, and
ex∣plain'd to us, the <HI>Circulation of the Blood,</HI> the punctual
Haberdasher repays his Kindness, with the <HI>Course of Exchange.</HI> If
some <HI>Patient,</HI> of the One, has taken <HI>Physick,</HI> for her <HI>Complexion</HI>; some Lady, who is the Other's Customer, has, with
equal Advantage to her Skin, fallen into <PB N="144" REF="153"/> the Wear of his
new <HI>Blush-Colour.</HI>—But, in the very Heighth of their <HI>Elucidations, Tony Gingle</HI> never fails to <HI>wedge in,</HI> between
'em both, some six Dozen of Quotations, from a Poem, call'd the <HI>Dispensary</HI>; though the intel∣ligent Mr. <HI>Juniper</HI> is
continually interrupting him with the <HI>true History</HI> of every weighty
Occurrence, in <HI>Apothecaries-Hall,</HI> which pro∣vok'd the Muse of the
merry <HI>Doctor.</HI> While poor <HI>Tom Tiresome,</HI> when he has yawn'd,
and listen'd, in vain, to the full Extent of his Pa∣tience, for an
Opportunity to grow Eloquent on the Use of <HI>Colchester-Bays,</HI> falls
asleep, in his Chair; and <HI>snores</HI> at us, in Revenge, to maintain
his Part in the Conversation.</P>
<P>HONEST <HI>Sir Portly</HI> wou'd be often at a Loss, to shape
such stubborn <HI>Obliquities,</HI> into any <HI>direct Line</HI> of
Society, if he had not, al∣ways, at his Elbow, the good-natur'd Mr. <HI>William
Weathercock,</HI> a Gentleman Farmer, in his Neighbourhood; who has a large,
but empty, Understanding.—The Mind of <HI>Will. Weathercock</HI> is
like the Sail of a great Ship, that has <HI>Room,</HI> to contain much Wind;
but, hav∣ing none, of its own producing, is swell'd out, by Turns, from all
the Quarters of the Com∣pass. <HI>Will.</HI> hits every Man's Taste; and is
of all People's Opinion. He is so desirous to <HI>Oblige,</HI> that there
is not a Point in the <HI>Circum∣ference,</HI> but wou'd serve him for a <HI>Center.</HI> He is this Moment, in <HI>your</HI> Sentiment: and, the <HI>next,</HI> will, before your Face, be of his Opinion who contradicts you.
But, if a Third <PB N="145" REF="154"/> affirms you <HI>Both</HI> to have been
in the Wrong, and appeals to <HI>Will. Weathercock:</HI>—<HI>Will,</HI>
with the best-bred Agility in the World, shifts, immediately, to <HI>his</HI> Side, too; and thinks it as clear as the Sun that You were, <HI>All Three,</HI> in the Right of it.</P>
<P>THIS pliable Ductility, in the Reason of <HI>Will. Weathercock,</HI>
hitches in, and chains toge∣ther, the most repugnant Idea's; and, uniting
them into an active Body, like the <HI>hook'd Atoms,</HI> of <HI>Des
Cartes,</HI> gives 'em Strength, Fluidity, and Consequence. Such a lively
Effect have the very <HI>Weaknesses</HI> of Humanity beyond the Force, and
Subtlety, of Ill-Nature, and Self-Interest!</P>
<P><HI>Tony Gingle,</HI> the last Time that I saw this Company
together, was so put to it, for an Opportunity, to repeat some Verses, he
was <HI>big with,</HI> that, in order to <HI>bring 'em in,</HI> with a
tolerable Appearance of Propriety, he began, to compliment <HI>Sir
Portly</HI>'s Lady, on the Fine∣ness of her Shape, and Skin, and inferring,
from their being Praise-worthy, that they should lie open to Observation,
took Occasion, by these Lines, to enforce his kind Opinion, that it was
necessary for her, to <HI>go naked.</HI></P>
<Q> 
<L>Can Forms, like yours, want Ornament of Dress?</L> 
<L>Beauty, like <HI>Truth,</HI> shines most, in <HI>Nakedness.</HI></L> 
<L>Dressing, may skreen Deformities from View:</L> 
<L>But, even, Adornment does but <HI>shadow you!</HI></L> 
<L>Most, but by what they wear are lovely made:</L> 
<L>You, Madam, <HI>lose,</HI> whene'er you seek such Aid.</L> 
<L><PB N="146" REF="155"/>While others dress, their Lovers Hearts to
warm,</L> 
<L>You <HI>put off</HI> nothing, but what <HI>veil'd</HI> a Charm!</L></Q>
<P>THE Lady blush'd, and smil'd. <HI>Sir Portly</HI> laugh'd aloud;
and begg'd to hear 'em over again. For my Part, I was doubly pleas'd, with the
Turn of the Verse; and Particularity of the Fancy. <HI>Tony Gingle,</HI>
himself, was in Raptures, which he cou'd not hide, at the Applause his
Muse had met with.—But <HI>Tom Tiresome</HI> had been weighing with
the Foresight of a prudent Citizen, the Ill Consequence of <HI>going
naked,</HI> to his good Friends the <HI>Weavers,</HI> and felt a commendable
Indignation, against the tuneful Mr. <HI>Gingle</HI>; insomuch that in the
Heat of his Resentment, he call'd him <HI>Madman</HI>; and <HI>Ballad-Singer</HI>—Pray, what do you sup∣pose, said he, wou'd
become of many thou∣sand honest People, who live, by making <HI>Pet∣ticoats,</HI> and what <HI>belongs</HI> to Petticoats, if all
handsome Women were to go <HI>impudently Na∣ked!</HI>—Out upon it!
Methinks I <HI>see</HI> 'em; and am asham'd of you! It is scandalous, and
in∣decent; and to say nothing of the <HI>Plot,</HI> which may lie, conceal'd,
in it, against <HI>Trade</HI>; it is the Whim of a <HI>Heathen Turk</HI>! and
not fit to be thought of, in a <HI>Christian-Country!</HI></P>
<P><HI>TONY</HI> by this Time had fathom'd the <HI>Depth</HI> of his
Antagonist, and began to play upon him, from his Batteries of poetical
Ar∣tillery; the War was growing hot: and threa∣tened dangerous Consequences,
when <HI>Will. Weathercock</HI> put in, between 'em, and taking 
<PB N="147" REF="156"/> Part with the <HI>Wit,</HI> because he observ'd him
to be a Favourite, made this Charge, upon his Opposite, like a brave and
faithful Auxiliary.</P>
<P>YOU are certainly in the right, most divert∣ing Mr. <HI>Gingle!</HI>—Nature never wou'd have cover'd Women with such white,
and tempt∣ing Skins, if she had not meant 'em for a pub∣lick Ornament. The
Ladies are Nature's Fa∣vourites; and, can we suppose her to have been
less liberal, to those <HI>Favourites</HI>; than to the <HI>Beasts,</HI>
which she plac'd below 'em?—She never sent us a <HI>Calf,</HI> but he
came into the World, with his <HI>Coat</HI> on. An <HI>Ox</HI> has no <HI>Breeches</HI> to pull off, when he goes to Bed weary. The <HI>Lamb</HI> is
born, ready dress'd, with her Freeze Coat about her. And who, ever, saw a <HI>Sow,</HI> drawing off her Shoes, and Stockings?—None sleep softer
than the <HI>Birds</HI> do: Yet they rise, in the Morning, with their
Feather∣beds, upon their Backs.—The most Excel∣lent, of the <HI>Virtues,</HI> are always painted, like <HI>Women</HI>; but it is, like <HI>Women, without Cloaths on!</HI> And, what does this mean, but to
insinu∣ate, to the Sex, that all, who love Virtue, shou'd despise
Hoop-Petticoats, and <HI>go naked?</HI>—There is this manifest
Absurdity in Wo∣mens Dressing, that it involves them in Per∣plexities,
which make the chief End they dress for, much more difficult than it need be:
For, as they order the Matter, they are to be taken to Pieces, like <HI>Watches,</HI> before a Man can come <HI>near</HI> enough, to examine the <HI>Wonders</HI> of <PB N="148" REF="157"/> their <HI>Workmanship.</HI>—<HI>Fashions</HI> differ, in all Nations; and,
what is a fine Dress, in one Place, is a frightful one, in another. But, were
Women once uncover'd, all Mens Judg∣ments wou'd agree, about 'em.—In a
Word, since the <HI>Sun, Moon,</HI> and <HI>Stars,</HI> appear, as Na∣ture
has made 'em; since all <HI>Animals</HI> are satis∣fy'd with their own
natural Figures; and, since the <HI>Roses</HI> are not asham'd to shew
their <HI>Thorns,</HI> with their <HI>Beauties</HI>; why shou'd <HI>Woman,</HI> Na∣ture's Masterpiece! seek to hide, or disguise, her
Loveliness?</P>
<P><HI>WILL</HI> went, eloquently on, after this ex∣traordinary Manner,
till he had fully con∣vinc'd, and satisfy'd, all that Part of his Au∣dience,
who were on this first Side the Question. But, casting his Eye, on poor <HI>Tom Tiresome,</HI> and, pitying the melancholy Air, with which he
listen'd to an Opinion, he had not Wit enough to argue against, though he
thought it little Better than Fornication, and Adultery;—<HI>Will,</HI>
in simple Honesty of Heart; and out of a mere Motive of Compassion,
slipt, by a very sudden Transition, into a sure Method of comforting
him; and chang'd his <HI>Level,</HI> as follows.</P>
<P>YET, I must do Justice to both Arguments, and it seems plain,
beyond Contradiction, that Beauty was <HI>made,</HI> to be <HI>ornamented.</HI>
The Pea∣cock's <HI>starry Tail,</HI> shews, that Nature loves gay Fancies. <HI>Nature</HI> dress'd the Hills, and the Meadows, in their fine,
embroider'd Man∣tles. <PB N="149" REF="158"/> It was <HI>she,</HI> that
spangled over all that glorious <HI>Veil,</HI> of Heaven!—Who, but <HI>Na∣ture,</HI> spotted the <HI>Ermin?</HI> And <HI>gilt</HI> the scaly
Skins, of Fishes, and of Serpents?—<HI>Man,</HI> indeed, she sent
into the World, plain, and naked:—Not, that she meant, he shou'd <HI>remain</HI> so,—but, because she <HI>adorn'd</HI> all Things
else, for his <HI>Reason,</HI> to chuse a Dress from. What is the
Silkworm, but Nature's little <HI>Spinster,</HI> set to Work for our common
Benefit? The very <HI>Spider</HI> keeps a <HI>Loom</HI>; and weaves a finer
Manufacture, than the Artists of <HI>Spittle-Fields,</HI> can!—Why
smell these love∣ly Flowers, round the Summer-House we are sitting in,
so delightfully sweet, and fragrant, but to teach us, That we shou'd <HI>perfume</HI> our selves? And, to what End can we suppose they were
made, so various, in their Colours, but to give Ladies the happy Hint, of
employ∣ing <HI>Dyers,</HI> and <HI>Silk-weavers!</HI></P>
<P><HI>TOM TIRESOME</HI> broke in upon him, at those two inspiring
Words, with a loud and triumphant <HI>Hollow</HI>; and filling, instantly, <HI>two Bumpers,</HI> drank Prosperity to <HI>Trade</HI>; and Health and
Happiness to Mr. <HI>Weathercock.</HI>—His Toasts went round the
Company; and both Parties were so well satisfied with the Share each had,
in his Decision, that Neither of them appear'd shock'd at the manifest
Contradicti∣on of his Reasoning. But <HI>Tony Gingle</HI> went away, the
most pleas'd, of the Two; because <HI>Sir Portly</HI> desir'd him, at
parting, to repeat his Verses, the third Time; and to make an∣other 
<PB N="150" REF="159"/> Copy, against next Meeting, on the com∣fortable use
of <HI>Swan-skin Breeches,</HI> to Ladies who wear Wide Hoops, in a sharp and
frosty Winter.</P>

<LETTER>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU observed, very justly, in one of your late Papers, that no
Figure in Life can be more graceful, and amiable, than that of a wise, and
good, Father; with Respect to an only Son, who possesses, and
deserves, his Indulgence.</P>
<P>THAT Lover of Mankind, <HI>Hortensius,</HI> gave us, lately, a
fine Example, of the Force of this Truth: But I look back, upon it with
Anguish, because I judge of his present <HI>Pain,</HI> by the Excess of
his past <HI>Pleasure.</HI></P>
<P>THO' <HI>Hortensius</HI> had, properly, but one Son, he was, in
some Sense, the <HI>Common Fa∣ther.</HI> <PB N="151" REF="160"/>—Nothing ever was carried higher than the <HI>Manliness</HI>
of his Heart, except its <HI>Sweetness,</HI> and <HI>Humanity:</HI> For he
was soften'd, by the benevolent Overflowings of a Pity, that touch'd him, at
once, in the two <HI>Extremes</HI> of Sensibi∣lity! His own <HI>Joys</HI>
were damp'd, by other Peoples <HI>Afflictions</HI>; and his private <HI>Sorrows</HI> chear'd, by the <HI>Prosperity</HI> of those who hated
him.—He not only <HI>forgave,</HI> readily, the most malicious of his
Enemies; but, that he might be sure to do it, generously, he <HI>forgot</HI> the very <HI>Injuries.</HI>—Even his <HI>Faults</HI> were
no other, than the unsuccessful Result of his <HI>Virtues</HI>; for
act∣ing rather by the measure of his <HI>Mind,</HI> than of his <HI>Power,</HI> he provok'd the Disappointed; to whom the <HI>Will</HI> is no <HI>Obliger.</HI>—His <HI>Wit</HI> could fear no Rivals, but his <HI>Courage,</HI> and his <HI>Honesty:</HI>—And every Person who
shall read this <HI>faint</HI> Character of his Excellence, has been oblig'd,
by the <HI>Effects</HI> of it; with regard to the Pub∣lick Interest; and the
Ornaments of Society.</P>
<P>SUCH <HI>was Hortensius!</HI>—and such <HI>Horten∣sius
is;</HI> if yet he may be said to <HI>be,</HI> after the Death of that dear <HI>Son,</HI> he <HI>liv'd in</HI>; and into whose fine Mind he had pour'd
out, and trans∣fus'd, all the Fullness of his Virtues; with a kind of Hope,
in <HI>him,</HI> and <HI>his,</HI> to have im∣mortaliz'd his very <HI>Body!</HI> and to receive, from future Ages, in the Honours paid to his
De∣scendants, the Tribute of that <HI>Praise,</HI> which his own, declining
Life, is, now, too scanty to make Room for.</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="161"/>HE, who knows the Father's Prospect; and how
suddenly <HI>Death</HI> has blasted it; having snatch'd away the Son,
when just blooming into Manhood; and, already, the <HI>Companion,</HI> and
the <HI>Friend,</HI> of his Father! never look'd on, without Joy;—never
oblig'd, without Gratitude;—never thought on, without
Ten∣derness;—never hearken'd to, without Won∣der! must be touch'd
with a lively Sense of what that Fate brought with it; which <HI>tore,</HI>
from such a Parent! (who, before, had lost the Mother,) such a Son; to
leave him, <HI>joy∣less</HI>; with the <HI>future</HI> World before him, like
a bleak, and barren <HI>Desart!</HI>—And the <HI>past,</HI> more
dreadful still, by a thousand goading Tendernesses; which cling for
ever to the Me∣mory; and torment, and sting, Reflection.</P>
<P>WHAT is Life, when we consider it under the Accidents it is liable
to, but an unresting Conflict, in the Dark, with Labours, Doubts, and
Disappointments!—One, such Loss, as <HI>Hortensius</HI> has
sustain'd, in this lov'd Son: (and so felt, too, as <HI>Hortensius</HI>
feels it) serves, for ever, to imbitter <HI>Hope</HI>; and draws Gloom enough
over the Mind, to put a Stop to our wild Pursuits, of Riches, Power, and
Reputa∣tion.</P>
<P>WHEN I compare the present Calamity of this Gentleman, with the
Satisfaction he is fallen from;—with that ripening
Expectati∣on;—that observing Vigilance; that unspeak∣able
Succession of little Transports, and tender Triumphs;—and all that
Train of <HI>Noble</HI> <PB N="153" REF="162"/> <HI>Weaknesses,</HI> which
warm, and open the human Heart, upon these dear, and soft, Occasions; I
confess to you that I am <HI>lost,</HI> in too quick a Sense of his
Misery!—And I tremble, while I learn from it, that we are expos'd to
it, most danger∣ously, on that strongest, and unguarded, Quarter,
whence we look for our <HI>sincerest Happiness!</HI></P>
<P>I MET <HI>Hortensius,</HI> some time since; and, letting down
my Glass, by Accident, just as his Chair was passing me, my Soul was
wound∣ed, through my Eyes, at the moving Majesty of his Sorrow.—He
endeavour'd to have skreen'd it, behind the Greatness of his Spirit; and put
me in Mind, when I was gone by him, of this fine, and natural Stroke, in <HI>Shake∣speare.</HI> 
<Q> 
<L>— She never <HI>told</HI> her Pain;</L> 
<L>But let <HI>Concealment,</HI> like a <HI>Worm,</HI> i'the <HI>Bud,</HI></L> 
<L>Prey, on her Damask Cheek:—<HI>seem'd,</HI> all
unmov'd;</L> 
<L>And sat,—like <HI>Patience,</HI> on a <HI>Monument;</HI></L> 
<L><HI>Smiling,</HI> at Grief!</L> </Q></P>
<P>IF a Man, who had embark'd himself, for some long Voyage, with
his Friends, and his whole Family, shou'd have the <HI>miserable</HI>
De∣liverance, to escape, alone, from a Shipwreck; and be thrown ashore,
upon some barren Island, whence he cou'd discern no Object round him, but
the Swelling of the Sea, while it was cover∣ing the sinking Heads of all, who
were <HI>near,</HI> or <HI>dear,</HI> to him: and, to preserve whose
che∣rish'd Lives, he wou'd, himself have dy'd, with <PB N="154" REF="163"/>
Pleasure!—Could such a <HI>dreadful Distinction</HI> be
consider'd as a Blessing to him?—Or, shou'd we not rather pity
him, as the Person, of the whole Number, whose Lot was least
supportable? And to which, a thousand <HI>Deaths</HI> were preferable!</P>
<P>YET, methinks, Mr. <HI>Plain-Dealer,</HI> tho', to lose a Worthy
Son, must be acknowledg'd a <HI>trying Misery</HI>; It is a Fate, severer
still, to be the Father of an <HI>Unworthy</HI> one.—
<Q> 
<L>— And live, to <HI>feel,</HI></L> 
<L>How, sharper than a <HI>Serpent</HI>'s <HI>Tooth,</HI> it
is,</L> 
<L>To <HI>have a thankless Child!</HI></L> 
<BIBL><HI>Shakespeare</HI> in <HI>King Lear.</HI></BIBL></Q></P>
<P>SHEW me a Good Man, whose paternal Care has been rewarded with
Contempt, from the ungrateful Object of his Tenderness:—Who sees his
Name disgrac'd, by the sordid Quali∣ties of an <HI>Heir,</HI> from whose
expected Excel∣lence he had promis'd himself an Encrease to its
Reputation:—Who lives, convinced, that he is hated, avoided, and wish'd <HI>dead,</HI> by a Wretch, whom he has given <HI>Life</HI> to! and from
whose Virtues, he had flatter'd himself, that his Old Age wou'd find a
Comfort! and his Memory retain a Glory!—<HI>Such a Father</HI> shall
look, with a kind of Envy, on <HI>Horten∣sius,</HI> and be the only Person
capable of weigh∣ing his Distress, without Agony.</P>
<P>THE Impartiality of Time, and Reason, placing in the same Degree
of <HI>Fame,</HI> those <PB N="155" REF="164"/> who polish'd, and
instructed, Nations, with those who govern'd, or conquer'd, them; <HI>Hortensius</HI> need not blush, to see his Name, rank'd with <HI>Princes.</HI>—I will therefore instance an Example of a vaster
Misery than his own, in the <HI>greatest Monarch</HI> of our Age: (why did
I not say <HI>of any Age?</HI>) I mean the <HI>Czar</HI> of <HI>Russia:</HI>—A Prince! whose Actions will draw after him a
Blaze of Glory, and Astonish∣ment, through the latest <HI>Depth</HI> of <HI>Time!</HI> and warm the Hearts of Posterity with the same generous
Reverence, for the Name of this im∣mortal Emperor, which we now feel, at
men∣tion of <HI>Alexander the Great:</HI> or the first, and noblest, of the <HI>Caesars.</HI></P>
<P>THERE can be very few of your Readers, who have not heard the <HI>Czar</HI> accus'd of one of the most shocking Kinds of <HI>Cruelty,</HI> with regard to the Death of his Son, the late <HI>Prince
Royal</HI>—But most of 'em, I believe, are igno∣rant, that this great,
and generous Sovereign, was so free from the Guilt of that ill-ground∣ed
Imputation, that he pardon'd his Condemn'd Son, in Person, in the most
tender, and move∣ing Manner, after he had been <HI>sentenc'd to Death,</HI>
not by the <HI>Czar himself,</HI> but by a Con∣vention of the <HI>Senate,</HI> and <HI>States,</HI> of <HI>Russia,</HI>
Ecclesiastical,—Civil,—and Military:—for having (to use
the very Words of the Sentence) <HI>Form'd a Design to get the Crown even in
the Life-time of his Father: opposing, and under∣mining, all his glorious
Improvements; and soli∣citing Insurrections, of Rebels, at Home; and</HI> 
<PB N="156" REF="165"/> <HI>the Assistance of a Foreign Army, to
accomplish the Destruction of them.</HI></P>
<P>I COU'D produce the most authentic, and undeniable, <HI>Evidences,</HI> that, throughout the whole Course of this great, and
private, Affli∣ction, the <HI>Czar</HI> discover'd more, of the <HI>Vast∣ness!</HI> the <HI>Humanity!</HI> and the <HI>Firmness,</HI> of
his <HI>Soul,</HI> than in all the Publick <HI>Torrent,</HI> of his Dangers;
and his Victories!—And, I think, I may challenge the most partial
Admirers of <HI>Antiquity,</HI> to produce any Thing, so humane! so heroic!
so <HI>God-like!</HI> as this <HI>Letter!</HI> even from their greatest,
and most honour'd, Cha∣racters.—It was writ, and deliver'd, by the <HI>Czar</HI>'s own Hand, to the Prince Royal, his Son, on the 11th Day of <HI>October,</HI> in the Year 1715.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>Extract of a <HI>LETTER,</HI> from the <HI>Czar</HI> of <HI>Russia,</HI> to his Son, the Prince <HI>Alexei.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>My SON,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU cannot be ignorant, since it is known to all the World, to
what Degree our People groan'd, under the <HI>Swedish</HI> Oppres∣sion.
We saw, by the Loss of our <HI>Maritime Provinces,</HI> that we were cut
off from all Com∣merce with the rest of the World. You know, too, what it
cost us, in the Begin∣ning of this War, to qualify ourselves to give a
Check to so implacable a Violence. But God led us by the Hand, till we were
wor∣thy, in our Turn, to make that Enemy trem∣ble, <PB N="157" REF="166"/>
before whom others had, long, trem∣bled.—We owe this, next to God, to our
own, unwearied Toil; and the Affection of our <HI>Best Children,</HI> our
faithful, <HI>Russian Sub∣jects.</HI></P>
<P>BUT, if, while I am viewing this Prospe∣rity of my Native
Country, I turn an Eye to <HI>my own Posterity,</HI> my Heart is oppress'd,
with <HI>Grief,</HI> that is too heavy for my <HI>Glory.</HI>—I see <HI>You,</HI> my Son! rejecting all the Means of becoming able to protect, or
govern, what I <HI>leave</HI> you.—You will not so much as hear of <HI>Warlike Study</HI>; tho' by <HI>that only</HI> we broke out of the
Obscurity we were in∣volv'd in; and made ourselves <HI>notic'd</HI> among
Nations.</P>
<P>I DO not exhort You to <HI>make War,</HI> with∣out <HI>Reason</HI>;—I but press you to learn the <HI>Art</HI> of it. I
cou'd place before your Eyes many <HI>Proofs,</HI> that this is necessary:
But I will name the <HI>Greeks,</HI> only; for they are united in the same <HI>Faith,</HI> with us.—What, but Neglect of <HI>Arms,</HI> was the
Occasion of their Ruin? Rest, and Idleness, had weaken'd them, till they
cou'd <HI>submit,</HI> even to <HI>Slavery!</HI> You mistake, if you think
it enough, for a Prince to have <HI>Good Generals.</HI> Men look up, to the <HI>Head:</HI> They examine <HI>his</HI> Inclinations, that they may conform
themselves to his <HI>Genius.</HI>—My Brother, in his Reign, lov'd
Magnificence, in <HI>Dress,</HI> and <HI>Horses.</HI> The Nation,
(<HI>before,</HI> not at all inclin'd that Way) form'd their Taste, upon
their <HI>Prince</HI>'s; for <PB N="158" REF="167"/> they imitate <HI>us,</HI>
as well in our <HI>Good</HI> Quali∣ties, as our <HI>Evil.</HI></P>
<P>YOU hate <HI>War:</HI>—You neglect it:—You will,
consequently, never learn it.—<HI>How,</HI> then, can you <HI>command
others?</HI>—How <HI>judge,</HI> of the Rewards, which shou'd encourage
the <HI>Deserving?</HI> or the Punishments, which must be held out, to
the Eyes of the <HI>Unworthy?</HI>—You will see, and hear, for ever,
with the Eyes, and Ears, of <HI>others</HI>; and resem∣ble a young <HI>Bird,</HI> that holds out its <HI>Bill</HI> to its <HI>Feeder.</HI></P>
<P>I AM a <HI>Man,</HI> my Son, and I <HI>must die.</HI>—To <HI>whom</HI> shall I leave the Accomplishment of my Labours? To <HI>whom</HI> shall I commit the <HI>Protection</HI> of my <HI>People?</HI>—To one! who, like the <HI>slothful Servant,</HI>
conceals, the Ta∣lent, he shou'd employ!—and falls back, from the
glorious <HI>Trust,</HI> which God has dis∣tinguish'd him by!</P>
<P>REMEMBER your long Obstinacy—and become generously
asham'd, of this Perverse∣ness in your Nature.—How often have I
reproach'd You! Nay, sometimes, you have compell'd my Affection even to <HI>punish</HI> you!—For some Years past, I have scarce spoke
to you.—Yet, all this avail'd nothing.—It was <HI>losing</HI> my <HI>Time!</HI>—It was <HI>striking</HI> the <HI>Air!</HI>—All
your Pleasure consists in Indo∣lence! Things, of which you ought to be
asham'd, because they make you contempti∣ble, compose your <HI>dearest
Delight</HI>!—Nor <PB N="159" REF="168"/> do you concern yourself for
the Consequen∣ces, it may produce to your Country!</P>
<P>AFTER having weigh'd, in my secret Breast, the fatal Tendency
of your Proceed∣ings;—After having reflected, how long, <HI>in vain,</HI>
I have endeavour'd to redeem you: I have thought fit, by my own Hand-writ∣ing,
to give you the <HI>last Result</HI> of my Will.—With this
Determination, however,—to wait, still, some Time longer, before I
put it in Execution; to expect, or <HI>hope,</HI> your Amendment:—If <HI>not,</HI> you are, hereby, to know, that I will <HI>deprive you of the
Succession;</HI> as a Man would cut off a <HI>gangren'd Member.</HI></P>
<P>DO not fancy, that, because I have no other Child but <HI>you,</HI> I only write this to <HI>terrify</HI> you: By <HI>God's
Pleasure,</HI> I will, most cer∣tainly, <HI>do it.</HI> For, since I
spare not my own <HI>Life,</HI> for the Welfare of my People: <HI>Why</HI>
shou'd I regard your <HI>Honour,</HI> who are not fram'd for <HI>becoming</HI> it?—I will, rather, transmit my Dominions to a <HI>Stranger,</HI> who shall be <HI>Worthy</HI> of them, than to my own <HI>unworthy Son,</HI> who can neither defend, nor adorn, them.</P>

<P>THE <HI>Coquette,</HI> and <HI>Ned Volatile,</HI> have been Indulged
in their Propensities to talk, and, enjoyed their Humour and Pleasan∣try;
nay, they have been permitted to break in upon one another, sometimes, with
unex∣pected Vollies of Raillery, which might, per∣haps, have been carried to
unwarrantable Lengths, and attended with ill Consequences, if they had not
been over-awed by the Presence of us, of a more sedate Turn; and
sometimes, seasonably parted, by the Interposition of the <HI>Major,</HI> and timely relieved from one another in those brisk
Onsets.</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="170"/>IF an Account of the little Infirmities of this
pair of Scufflers has had its proper Tendency towards the Cure of any <HI>noted
Impertinents,</HI> of either Sex, who have a Flux in their Tongues, I shall
not think that I have as yet offended the Gravity of my Character, or lost
any Time, in penning down such Levities, the Know∣ledge of which, rightly
convey'd, produces Consequences of so much Importance to the Quiet and
Repose of the more serious part of the Human Species. Thus far I can say,
from what has fallen within my own Observation, That several gay Parts,
which I have dis∣cover'd, of the Conversation between <HI>Ned</HI> and the <HI>Coquette,</HI> have excited an unusual Vein of Merriment among many of my
young Readers; but, tho' I must confess, I had a secret <HI>Plea∣sure</HI> in finding them <HI>pleased</HI>; I should have been
delighted, in a more exquisite Degree, if my Writings, taking a better
Effect, had stir'd up, in some of them, whom it wou'd have become, a little
more <HI>Self-Reflection,</HI> and <HI>less Laughter.</HI> They who only
laugh at the Follies of others, give me the worst half of their Ap∣plause;
I shall never be compleatly pleas'd, till I can teach them to laugh at
themselves: they think me a pleasant and facetious old Fellow, but I wou'd
be, at the same Time, a useful and a profitable Companion.</P>
<P>I LATELY saw the most penetrating pair of Eyes that ever shone
upon Paper, very busily employed upon that <HI>Plain-Dealer,</HI> wherein I
described the last Tongue-Skirmish, between <PB N="162" REF="171"/> the <HI>Two Talkatives</HI> of our <HI>Assembly.</HI> She read it to herself,
and ever, now and then, laugh'd out heartily. I could guess, by observing
her Eye, what Passages tickled her the most, and found 'em to be those,
which threw the for∣ward Humour of the two Combatants into the strongest
Pitch of Ridicule. I was in hopes, That, if any of that Female Infirmity, which
she so heartily laugh'd at in others, fell to her Share, she would ever
after carefully avoid appearing in the same Light, in which she had seen
her Neighbour make so ungraceful a Figure, and whom she confess'd, by
such <HI>sen∣sible Signs,</HI> to be a proper Object of Ridicule. But, to
my very great Wonder, she no sooner laid the Paper out of her Hands, but
she in∣continently exercised those Lips, with ten times more Velocity in <HI>Talking,</HI> than they seem'd to have in the <HI>Course</HI> of their <HI>Reading.</HI> Her Tongue out-gallop'd the <HI>Coquette</HI>'s; and I am
persuaded, if <HI>Ned Volatile</HI> had been to start with her upon equal
Terms, she would fairly have distanced <HI>him</HI>; he would have lost
Sight of her in the first Flight: Up got I, (no Room being given to take
Leave) and march∣ed off, as fast as my Oaken-stick would help me; and have
been mightily discouraged, to see the little Effects of my
Performances.—I warrant this Gossip, told the next Company she fell
into, That she read my <HI>Paper,</HI> and the Moment after, in utter
Contempt of the Moral palpably contained in it, bolted away into numberless
Fooleries, and as many Imperti∣nences <PB N="163" REF="172"/> as before. But can
this pert Fair-One be properly said to have <HI>read</HI> the PLAIN-DEALER?
No, she <HI>saw</HI> it, but did not <HI>read</HI> it. At this Rate I
must be obliged to turn <HI>Lecturer</HI> upon my own Works, and where there
are any genteel Hints, substitute rougher, and coarser, in their Room,
that they may not be too deli∣cate, and escape Observation. It is the Sign
of a well-manner'd Writer, just to touch upon the Verge of a severe Truth,
and leave the rest to a Reader's private Meditation. But if this Method
proves ineffectual, it is next to impos∣sible, to preserve the Character
of a PLAIN-DEALER, without saying something that may penetrate, more
violently. I shall, therefore for the Future, without Scruple, declare, that
any Eyes, let them appear never so beautiful, which at once look over, and
overlook, these Papers, are in a Manner as bad as blind; and that the only
Grace in beautiful Lips, which are almost always in Motion, and scarce ever
to the Purpose, consists in the Propriety of their Colour, which shews,
as if they blush'd, with a Sense of their own Impertinence.</P>
<P>THE Gentlemen run over my Papers, as well as the Ladies, without
reading them. They conceive a Jest on some particular Per∣son, then
laugh; and become more a Jest themselves: yet will not consider, till
they are told in plain Terms, that each of them is that <HI>particular
Person.</HI></P>
<P>THE odd Spark, whom my Correspondent, fair <HI>Cleora,</HI> very
properly liken'd to a <HI>Mercury</HI> <PB N="164" REF="173"/> <HI>Reversed,</HI> is the same odd Spark he was, and, what is worse, has
since that Time brought over Hundreds of Proselytes, to the same silly
Fashion; so that one would be apt to imagine, there is nothing more
wanting, to make a Dress very popular, but shewing it first to be very
ridiculous. There seems to be a general Emulation among the
Fashion-Mongers, which of them can be the most Whimsical, as the on∣ly
sure Way to be the most Taking and Suc∣cessful.</P>
<P>THESE <HI>Mercuries</HI> consist mostly of your Sma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, Dapper Blades; tho' some very tall
Men have condescended to come into the Fa∣shion, which makes them appear to
have no Heads at all, or as if half the Head, lay hid in the Bag behind it.</P>
<P>IT is an extraordinary Entertainment to see the whole <HI>Mall</HI>
crowded with this kind of Pup∣pets; and yet more so, when examining these
Childish Figures, you read in their Faces, that they generally consist of
Persons from Five and Twenty, to upwards of Forty Years of Age. Some Fops of
Fifty-odd, make the first Decays of Age remarkable in them by this Dress,
which would be otherwise unnoticed. A jolly old Friend of mine, was taking an
Airing with me in the Park the other Day, 
<Q REND="inline">'What must be in these Peoples Minds, <HI>said
he,</HI> that, in order to look Gay, appear Hoary, like the Pictures of <HI>Old
Winter,</HI> when every Thing looks flourishing about them? The very Breezes
blow to refresh them, and sweep <PB N="165" REF="174"/> away the Load of
Dust, which wou'd swel∣ter them if they had not ingeniously prevent∣ed
it, by a Cement of Orange-Butter.</Q></P>
<P>CAN any of these Sparks <HI>pretend</HI> to read my Papers; who,
without looking into their Minds, continue to cultivate the Outside of their
Heads after such a prodigious and pre∣posterous Rate! As to the Powderers
of Fifty, I must tell them, that even I, who am in my grand Climacterick, and
have gone thro' the Snow of so many Winters, am not half so much powder'd
as they, and that therefore it cannot look decent in them.</P>
<P>IF we survey from the Head downwards, every Part of their Dress,
there is not one, but what is preposterous.</P>
<P>IF a Man, for Example, was to take a Re∣view of the Officers and
Soldiers, provided they had Sleeves of the Modern Cut, he would take them for
an Army of Invalids. The Company of <HI>Taylors</HI> seem to have forgot
them∣selves, and want the Assistance of the <HI>Barber-Surgeons,</HI>
to instruct them in the Rules of Ana∣tomy, without which, the Elbows of Men
are visibly out of Joint, and can never be set cle∣verly.</P>
<P>THE young Fellows have drop'd down the Flaps of their Coats, very near
as Low as the Clocks of their Stockings, so that scarce any thing of the
Leg is to be seen but Ancle; and they seem to be pulling them still lower
and lower, that they may be more and more like Petticoats, which the Women are,
grate∣fully, <PB N="166" REF="175"/> tucking up shorter and shorter, that
there will be a decent Necessity for converting them into <HI>Breeches.</HI></P>
<P>BUT I observe, that the Ladies go open-breasted in <HI>Winter,</HI> tho' the Dappers button up to the Chin in <HI>Summer</HI>; and
have garnished the Folds of their Coats with Supernumerary Buttons, the Use
of which I cannot possibly learn, tho' I have applied to those who are
very deeply read. I would propose Buttons and Button-holes down the Seam of
the Back, that they may be button'd up to the Poll, as they are to the Chin,
which will be of great Use, when, they are lazy; for they may be unbutton∣ed,
as Ladies are unlac'd, <HI>behind,</HI> by a Servant.</P>
<P>IF these Alterations should be carried on a little further, my
Friend <HI>Gunter</HI>'s Predictions, concerning the Mutation of Sexes, must
be al∣lowed to be punctually verified.</P>
<P>WHAT I most fear is, lest our Merchants and others, whose
Affairs have kept them ma∣ny Years beyond Sea, shou'd be surprized, at
their Return, to find us dress'd after the pre∣sent Mode, hear our Officers
sing <HI>Italian,</HI> our Beaus compliment one another in <HI>High
Dutch,</HI> our old Women talk Politicks in <HI>French,</HI> and not believe us
to be the same Generation of Peo∣ple, they left behind them in this
Island.</P>

<P>IT has been remark'd in the <HI>Course</HI> of these PAPERS, that
among the <HI>Wise,</HI> there are none more <HI>Foolish</HI> than the <HI>Witty:</HI> May it not with great Truth be said, That, among the merely <HI>Witty,</HI> none are more <HI>ridiculed</HI> than the <HI>Wise?</HI> If a <HI>Clergyman</HI> offers to speak, the <HI>Witlings</HI> foretel <HI>Dullness.</HI></P>
<P>BUT the Case is quite otherwise with Per∣sons of a serious
Cast of Thought, who know, that, as <HI>Truth</HI> is the only Mean, by which <HI>Divines</HI> can surely instruct, so their <HI>Stile</HI> must be
peculiarly clear, which, without stopping at <HI>Brightness,</HI> pursues <HI>Solidity.</HI> I am therefore fully satisfy'd, that, that Grave Class
of my <HI>Readers,</HI> whom I count doing me an Honour, when I see them clap
on their Spectacles to read my <HI>Works,</HI> as if they thought they could
meet with Improvement from them, after their <PB N="168" REF="177"/> own long
Experience of the <HI>World,</HI> will be pleased with the following <HI>Discourse,</HI> which the <HI>Clergyman</HI> made, the other Day, upon
that <HI>Virtue</HI> call'd <HI>Plain-Dealing.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN we consider that every Body, said he, is continually
recommending the <HI>Subject</HI> of your <HI>Papers</HI> in common
Conversation, one would think there was little need for a Writer to employ
his Time upon it: But when we reflect how few practise it, <HI>no
Subject</HI> requires more <HI>Pains</HI> to inforce it. People praise it
every <HI>Day,</HI> and violate it every <HI>Hour,</HI> and <HI>common
Honesty,</HI> like <HI>common Sense,</HI> is boldly pretended to by <HI>every Body,</HI> but really pos∣sessed by <HI>few.</HI></P>
<P>IT must be worth a little of our <HI>Meditation</HI> to inform
ourselves, how this <HI>Quality</HI> comes to be so Valuable among us, and
yet we so frequently and so easily part with it; in short, by what <HI>Mystery</HI> in our <HI>Conduct</HI> such Numbers of Men, would appear
to be what they are not.</P>
<P>WE see upon the first Moment's Reflection, that PLAIN-DEALING is
the <HI>Soul</HI> of <HI>Friendship</HI>; it is the necessary <HI>Essence</HI> of it; and, when that is once gone, the most warm and
lively <HI>In∣timacies</HI> can no longer subsist: They grow cold and dye
at once. Now <HI>Friendships,</HI> we all know, are the very Bonds of <HI>Society</HI>; again, we as clearly comprehend, that what we call, a <HI>Good Understanding,</HI> among publick Bodies of Men, (which cannot be
maintained but by <HI>Fair-Dealings</HI>) is the Prop and Support of every
Civilized <HI>Government.</HI> Since we are so <PB N="169" REF="178"/> soon
and so perfectly convinced, that <HI>Plain-Dealing</HI> carries along with it
such Advantages, it is no wonder, that we should desire to be reckoned
the Possessors of so valuable a <HI>Good.</HI> It is Natural for us
to desire it; it is in this Sense scarce a Vertue; for, morally
speaking, it is what we cannot help desiring. Every Mortal breathing has
felt the first Principles of <HI>Honesty</HI> very strong in his Heart;
and even he that departed from it, knows his Struggle was very great. It is the
Quality he covets to find in every one with whom he converses, and he
secretly adores the Man in whom he hap∣pens to meet it.</P>
<P>ON the other hand, if <HI>Plain-Dealing</HI> had not all these
attractive <HI>Charms,</HI> yet there is something so ridiculous and
unpopular in play∣ing the Double upon Mankind; there is such a Baseness
in the doing of it, such an Impossi∣bility of doing it often without
being discover∣ed; such an irretrievable Ignominy, such a quick and
painful Remorse, that a <HI>Life</HI> of Dis∣simulation is full enough of
Horror to fright Men from it, if a <HI>Life</HI> of Honesty had not Charms to
tempt, and invite us.</P>
<P>SURE then it is a Riddle, that we are not like the People we <HI>Love,</HI> but the People we <HI>Hate.</HI> The meanest Slave cannot bear
to be called a Dissembler, and yet the great∣est Princes do not blush
to dissemble. <HI>Qui nescit Dissimulare, nescit Regnare,</HI> is
grown their Political Motto. Statesmen originally meant the same as <HI>Faithful</HI> Servants of a <HI>State</HI>; <PB N="170" REF="179"/> they are
now adays called <HI>Politicians,</HI> and Politican is little more than a new
Name for <HI>Deceiver.</HI> Even Religious Persons have enter'd into a
Conspiracy against <HI>Plain-Dealing</HI>; Dis∣semblers, in Holy
Orders, have caused, <HI>In ver∣bo Sacerdoti,</HI> to signify a <HI>Falshood,</HI> and <HI>Nolo Epis∣copare</HI> to stand for desiring
earnestly what a Man pretends to <HI>decline.</HI></P>
<P>UPON the whole it is nothing but Folly and Cowardice, that seduces
Men first out of the plain Road of <HI>Honour</HI> and <HI>Vertue,</HI> into
the By-ways of <HI>Double-Dealing?</HI> and, when once <HI>Cunning</HI> took
the Place of <HI>Wisdom</HI> in Mens Minds, and <HI>Fear</HI> instead of
Resolution govern'd their Hearts; they at length brought <HI>Double-Dealing</HI> (which was, at first, a <HI>Crime,</HI> by <HI>Ac∣cident</HI>) thro' a long and constant Habit, to be no less than an <HI>Art</HI> and <HI>Profession.</HI></P>
<P>SUCH a Duty as <HI>Plain-Dealing,</HI> cannot be too much known, and
nothing is learnt, more easily; but then in a Corrupt Age nothing is so
easily lost: in a depraved and impious Com∣pany, nothing is so readily
parted from.</P>
<P>THE Clergy have a Right to diffuse among the People this Spirit of
Honesty, by Precept, and a more particular Duty, incumbent upon them, to
enforce it by Example. But too many among them have such a Taste for
world∣ly Interest, as to have lost the Relish of Primi∣tive Religion; and
while they profess them∣selves <HI>Priests,</HI> appear ashamed, to be
thought Christians.</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="180"/>AS there is nothing nobler than a good Priest;
so there is nothing so shocking and ri∣diculous, as to see a base Man
of that Profes∣sion, which annexes Reverend to his Name. A Layman, that
does not reverence a good Pastor, is a Profligate: But a wicked Man, in holy
Orders, is a Monster. The Ancients, when they drew the Pictures of Beauty and
Ugliness, took Pieces from several Objects, the better to compleat their
Design. In order to excite true Horror against wicked Prelates I shall
use the same Liberty, and draw from the wickedest, I have heard of, a
kind of Eccle∣siastical <HI>Caligula,</HI> and suppose him to be a
Bishop, to give him the Fulness of his Deformity: I shall then give the
Sketch of a virtuous Eccle∣siastick; but must remark, for the Honour of
Priesthood, that the ill Character is compound∣ed of a great many <HI>Double-Dealers,</HI> and that the good one, did really belong to one good
Man.</P>
<P><HI>UMBRA</HI> was always a great Pretender to Virtue and Piety, but
never Possessor of Com∣mon Honesty: He made Godliness his Gain, and
never espoused the Interests of Virtue, but with the View of pushing
his own. <HI>Umbra</HI> cant∣ed inordinately; but never once pray'd hearti∣ly.
In order to ingratiate himself with great Families, he applied himself to
learn a false kind of Oratory, and grew a famed Panegy∣rist, and Composer
of Funeral Sermons, in which he would salve up the Vices of great Men, in
favour of Death-bed Repentance; <PB N="172" REF="181"/> and demonstrate very
elaborately, how the Virtue of a Moment, could atone the Impiety of an Age. If
he dined at a Nobleman's Table, he said a scanty Grace to a full Meal, and
would just dip down his Head to the great Author, who multiplies Food for the
Use and Benefit of his Creatures; but, before he seated himself, would
make a profound Reverence to the Debauchee that entertain'd him. When he grew,
by these Means, acquainted with great Men, he turn'd Politician, and raised
himself up on the blind Side of one, by setting him at Variance with
another: He next became a State Preacher, and changed his Note as the Times
changed, so that there were many Ser∣mons of his, direct Contradictions to
each other. He sold the Gospel by Retale, and lived long in Grandeur, by
debasing Christianity: he has sometimes taken Delight in abusing the
very Priesthood, and triumph'd in a Bishoprick, when he deserv'd to be
excommunicated. Thus vested, unhappily, with Prelatical Autho∣rity, he would
ruin his honest Inferiors, and if they sought Justice, terrify them by
his Pri∣vilege. This <HI>Double-Dealer,</HI> with a Mitre on his Head, lived
prevaricating for many Years, and then died as he lived, leaving such
Fals∣hoods under his Hand on his Death-bed, as if the Measure of his Days
had been too short for his Prevarication.</P>
<P>THERE was such a Person lately living as <HI>Cordatus,</HI> who
had an honourable Post in the Church. He belong'd to a great Cathedral, 
<PB N="173" REF="182"/> and was really a Person of Quality; joining the
Gentleman with the Christian, he was both Religious and Polite. He had this
peculiar Felicity in his Temper, that, though he lived in an Age of Faction, he
judged many, of a different Opinion from himself, to be honest and
well-meaning Men, and, by treating them as such, won them over to his
Opinion. He never used his Authority but to quiet Animosi∣ties, to make or
renew Friendships, and to establish Peace, good Will, and Union. He was
learned and wise, and tho' he had an Im∣pediment in his Speech, he preached
clearly to the Understanding. He never chose that Oratory, which tends more
to nourish Pride in the Speaker, than to instil Virtue into the Hearer. He
knew it his Duty to instruct the Ignorant, and therefore studied
Perspicuity, in all that he deliver'd from the Pulpit. He made Virtue the
Study of one part of his Life, and the other was taken up with the Labour of
communicating what he had learnt, for the Use and Instruction of others. He
never con∣cealed any thing that might make other Men better; save one, and
that was his Charity. All knew he recommended what he acted, and finding the
Preacher in earnest, the Hearers were so too. Nothing among <HI>his</HI>
Parishioners, was deliver'd over to Shame, but Impiety. He lived thus for
many Years a general Blessing, and his Death was a Common Calamity. The
Poor lost a Benefactor, the Rich a valuable <PB N="174" REF="183"/> Friend,
and every individual Man of his Ac∣quaintance, an exemplary Companion.</P>
<P>I MUST, before I conclude, advise all Cler∣gymen not to fix any
Parts in the Description of <HI>Umbra,</HI> upon any particular Persons
they may not think well of; because that will be shewing, they have some
of his Spirit: Let them rather study to live like <HI>Cordatus,</HI> that
they may die with his Character. What signi∣fies finding out who is meant by <HI>Umbra,</HI> or who is <HI>Cordatus?</HI> The profitable Search will be to
examine what Parts they have acted like <HI>Umbra,</HI> and amend them; and, in
what they have personated <HI>Cordatus,</HI> and improve them: If they do
otherwise, they will imitate the Dog in the Fable, and, by catching at the
Shadow, lose the Substance of my Dissertation.</P>

<P>I PUBLISH the following LETTER, in Justice to some great

never <HI>sparkles</HI> till it is <HI>struck</HI> upon.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>Old Favourite!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HOW little did I think, when you pro∣fess'd yourself a PLAIN
DEALER, that you wou'd, so soon, become a <HI>Tatler!</HI> Pray don't
mistake this, for a <HI>Compliment:</HI> I am not in so obliging a Humour,
I assure you. I find, Men must be <HI>cautious,</HI> when they keep
communicative Company: For there are a kind of Talkative old Gentlemen, who
never know when to have done, with their Acquaintance; but will carry a Man
about <PB N="176" REF="185"/> with 'em, for half an Age after his Funeral:
However to go, at once, into my Matter.</P>
<P>I HAVE a very particular Regard for <HI>Sir Portly Rufus:</HI> Nor
do his Commands want their due Weight with me. But, as a cer∣tain Poet,
somewhere expresses himself, 
<Q> 
<L>All Duties must to Self-Defence give Way;</L> 
<L>For injur'd Honour cannot brook Delay.</L> </Q> </P>
<P>LET the Ladies, therefore <HI>wait,</HI> for their Swan-skin
Breeches. My Muse may, per∣haps, be at Leisure, against Winter: And none,
but a hasty <HI>Prude</HI> or two, can want 'em, this warm Weather. So, I
shall have Time to stand justify'd, against your false Accusation, <HI>That I study nothing, but Poetry. Tom Tiresome,</HI> a heavy Blockhead!
can talk of nothing but the Stocks! But Mr. <HI>Juniper</HI> is a Man of
Learning; let <HI>him</HI> speak of me, from his own Knowledge. Or I might
ap∣peal to <HI>Will Weathercock,</HI> (against whom I often maintain
Arguments) whether there is any Truth in your Accusation? But, as an∣other
Poet says, upon some Occasion or other, in some Place that I have
forgot, 
<Q> 
<L>In vain are Toothless Satires writ</L> 
<L>'Gainst him, who <HI>feels</HI> himself a Wit.</L> </Q> </P>
<P>I shall scorn to owe my Vindication to any Hand but my own: And
hope to convince <PB N="177" REF="186"/> you, before I end this Letter, <HI>That
I have more in me than Poetry.</HI></P>
<P>PRAY, who taught you in the first Place to be <HI>Witty</HI> upon
your Friends, before you cou'd Spell their <HI>Names</HI> right? All the Men of
Erudition, who have been numerous among the <HI>Jyngles,</HI> wrote
themselves with an j <HI>Consonant:</HI> A soft and shapely Letter!
Which you have barbarously demolish'd; and built up, in the Place of it, a
broad∣back'd, <HI>Gothick</HI> G: A rough, and choaking, <HI>Guttural!</HI>
that is scarce fit for any Thing, but to gargle a <HI>German</HI>'s Throat
with! Every <HI>Graduate,</HI> (duce take this G!) Every <HI>Stu∣dent,</HI> in <HI>Orthography,</HI> knows the manifest Difference, between <HI>Jyngle</HI>
and <HI>Gingle!</HI> what tho' <HI>Jilt</HI> sounds like <HI>Gentlewoman,</HI> and <HI>Jackanapes</HI> like <HI>Ginger-bread!</HI> If
our Lan∣guage is a Double-Dealer, and for want of settled Usage, and a
limited Acceptation, gives Encouragement to idle People to run Divisions on
the <HI>Alphabet</HI>; that is nothing to <HI>me.</HI> All I mean by it, is, to
convince you, that I understand <HI>something,</HI> besides Poetry.</P>
<P>THIS, however, <HI>en passant</HI> only, for I am Master of <HI>better</HI> Sciences; such as are new, even in <HI>Theory.</HI> But, not
to triumph, too much, over the Mistake of a Friend, (since it is a very
common Error to think too meanly, of the Merit we are familiar with) I will

to your Shame, till it shall be stopt, by your Conviction.</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="187"/> I AM, you must know, then, a kind of <HI>im∣material Anatomist:</HI> I can dissect an <HI>Imagina∣tion</HI>;
or disembowel a <HI>Quality:</HI> I am about to make publick Profession
of my Art: And having my <HI>Chariot</HI> as good as ready, the rest of my <HI>Apparatus</HI> will be, comparatively, of no Consequence. I shall <HI>drive</HI> fast into <HI>Practice.</HI> But the chief Scruple I labour
under, is, by what Title to distinguish my∣self: I wou'd make use of
the Word <HI>Doctor,</HI> but that the College of Physicians, who place much
Learning in <HI>Privilege,</HI> wou'd have me ascend, by <HI>Degrees,</HI> to
that Dignity: Which is too phlegmatic a Prescription to agree with my Temper.
I am, therefore, inclina∣ble, since very much of my Practice will lie among
the Ladies, to call myself a <HI>Mind-Midwife:</HI> Insinuating, by that
Hint, That I can see 'em as safely brought to Bed of their <HI>Affectation,</HI> and other <HI>spiritual Conceptions,</HI> as they can
be assisted, in their <HI>Matrimonal Preg∣nancies,</HI> by the bodily
Brothers of my Pro∣fession.</P>
<P>THE first Patient I propose to <HI>lay,</HI> is a pregnant <HI>Male</HI> Member of that learned <HI>College</HI> I was mentioning. To be a <HI>Doctor</HI>'s <HI>Doctor,</HI> is, to cure, in the best Light
possible: And I wou'd emulate the Example of that me∣morable Magician, <HI>Zyto,</HI> who was sent for, says a <HI>grave</HI> Historian, by the
Emperor <HI>Charles the</HI> IVth; to try his Skill, against a <HI>High
German Conjurer; Zyto,</HI> who was a <HI>White</HI> Wizard, and worth a
Hundred of your <PB N="179" REF="188"/> <HI>Faustus</HI>'s; stood, in
Presence of the Emperor, and, with inflexible Composure, observ'd the
Instances of his Rival's Art; who swallow'd, at last, a burning
Horse-shoe: And defy'd our <HI>Zyto,</HI> to do it after him. But <HI>Zyto</HI> chose, rather (that he might end the Dispute, at a <HI>Morsel</HI>) to swallow the <HI>Conjurer himself!</HI> And expanding
his Mouth into horrible, and inhuman, Wideness, snapt him up, like a
Radish! But, when he came to his dirty Shoes, and disdain'd to swallow
farther, he ran with him, to a Horse-pond, hard by; and launch'd him out into
the middle of it; to the no small Entertainment, and Satis∣faction of the
Company.</P>
<P>THE Name of my future Patient, is <HI>Sir Clouterly Rumble:</HI> a
Professor, of the <HI>Eque∣strian,</HI> as well as the <HI>Medicinal</HI>
Order. He car∣ries, on his Countenance, the clearest Symp∣toms of his
Grievance: Which is a Distem∣per, that some moral Doctors have
distin∣guish'd by the Name of <HI>Vanity.</HI> It operates, with most
Violence, on the Head, and the Heart; tho' it affects the Limbs also: And,
sometimes swells the whole Frame, into the most enormous <HI>Turgidity.</HI> It shakes the <HI>Fin∣gers</HI> of this afflicted
Gentleman, with a year∣ly Convulsion of the Nerves; during which Fits, it is
dangerous to let <HI>Paper</HI> lie in his way: For he applies himself, with
the wildest Ecstasy to strike it over, at Random, with odd Lines,
crooked Cyphers, and Characters, wholly unintelligible! to the pitiful
Dis∣quieting, <PB N="180" REF="189"/> and Perplexity, of his Brain: Which,
becoming heated, <HI>praeter-naturally,</HI> by such extravagant Agitation,
inflames, and nourishes his Malady.</P>
<P>IT was a laudable Accomplishment, that of calculating Distempers
by examining the Patient's <HI>Water!</HI> In Imitation of this good Custom,
I poured out, before me, a large Quantity of the sick Man's <HI>Prosaic,</HI> and <HI>Poe∣tic Emissions</HI>; and upon inspecting
the <HI>La∣bel,</HI> annex'd to one of 'em which he ad∣dresses, poor
Gentleman! to an Illustrious young Prince in <HI>Germany,</HI> with as grave,
and serious an Air, as if it was really, some∣thing fit to be look'd upon!
I presently discovered both the Distemper, and his pro∣per Cure for it.
The <HI>Tokens,</HI> as far as I can remember, were Strongest, and most
Evi∣dent, upon the following Eruption of puru∣lent Matter, from a Complication
of <HI>Scrophulous</HI> Humours, which the <HI>Greeks</HI> call
<GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. But the Name the Patient
himself wou'd have it go by, is ALFRED. It is, in short, a most
malignant, and virulent, <HI>Species,</HI> of the <HI>Epic,</HI> or <HI>Narrative Cacoethes!</HI> See a Part of it!</P>
<Q>THE Glory of a People depending on the Ex∣cellence of their King,
he, who loves his Country, cannot better promote its Happiness, than by <HI>teaching</HI> this King to <HI>Govern</HI> it. I know, that your Highness
is well enough <HI>Taught</HI> already: But Examples being better than
Precepts, espe∣cially, when presented in the <HI>Works</HI> of <HI>Cele∣brated Authors;</HI> Men of <HI>copious Invention,</HI> 
<PB N="181" REF="190"/> and a <HI>fruitful Imagination:</HI> It was <HI>for that

contribute more to the <HI>Succession of your Illustrious House,</HI>
than ever I boasted of; because I did it, for the <HI>Service of
Religion,</HI> and the <HI>Glory</HI> of my <HI>Country.</HI></Q>
<P>NO Spots, in a <HI>Purple Fever,</HI> were ever thus <HI>Morbidly</HI> Significant! If there were not, in the Nature of the
Symptoms, something <HI>opposite to Contagion,</HI> I should have judged
Sir <HI>Clouterly</HI>'s Distemper to be, most <HI>Putridly
Pestilential!</HI>—The poor Man, in fine, is extreamly far gone! and
would, certainly, have been irrecoverable, under any Hand but mine.—There
is but <HI>One</HI> Cure, for so exceeding foul a Stomach, and that must
be, to ply him with <HI>Emetics,</HI> till, to speak in a Physical
Phrase, I have made him <HI>Vo∣mit his Heart up.</HI>—I have a Pill, to
Purge Vanity; a <HI>Specific!</HI> and a <HI>Nostrum!</HI> which will do his
Business, effectually; and it shall be the first, of my Operations, as

<P>HONEST Mr. <HI>Jyngle,</HI> our good, and agreeable Friend, put into
my Hands, Yesterday, a Copy of that comical Letter, which he sent you,
about <HI>Sir Clouterly Rum∣ble,</HI> and I, being wonderfully pleased with

said, was, <HI>Oh! Mr. Tiresome! Here's the Pleasantest

<P>I AM afraid, I must close in, with my Friend <HI>Will</HI>'s

He has a plain and open Heart, but wants both <HI>Foresight</HI> and <HI>Reflection.</HI> He is Mis∣chievous, not Malicious: and errs on, with∣out
Ill Purpose, from a Natural <HI>Clumsiness</HI> of Mind, and <HI>Healthy
Coarseness</HI> in his Understand∣ing. He overturns Things, without
feeling 'em, like the <HI>Elephant</HI> of <HI>Africa</HI>; that, walk∣ing

<P>WHEN I took him with me, the first time, to drink Tea, at <HI>Patty

done a ridiculous Action, and look'd as <HI>like an Ass,</HI> as any
reasonable Man could have desir'd him; but he repented, as most Men do,
when it was too late, and to no Purpose: And I verily believe, I am doom'd to <HI>great Afflictions,</HI> (if my Passion shou'd conti∣nue) for that <HI>dull Start of Mr. Alderman Blun∣der</HI>'s.</P>

<LETTER>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAVING observ'd, That my <HI>Extract</HI> of the CZAR of <HI>RUSSIA</HI>'s <HI>Letter to his SON,</HI> which you publish'd in your 
<PB N="186" REF="195"/> 20th Paper, gave a very great Surprize to the Generality
of your Readers, who had form'd, upon common Rumour, an Opinion of that
Prince's Death, extremely different from the Truth; I now send you as brief
an Abstract as possible, from a Relation, which was pub∣lish'd in <HI>High Dutch,</HI> by the Minister of a <HI>German Court,</HI> not likely
to be partial in Favour of the <HI>Czar,</HI> and who was present, and an
Eye-Witness of the Facts, which he publishes.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Czar</HI> had long inclin'd to ally him∣self with some
powerful Family of <HI>Germany,</HI> by the Marriage of his Son; whom he hop'd
to reclaim from his Indolence, by the Conver∣sation of a Princess of high
Extraction, and a noble Education: For this Prince had, by a continual
associating himself with the vilest Company, contracted such corrupt
Habits, as could not fail of producing an Aversion to him, in all honest
Minds. He was so far sunk in Sensuality, that no Representations, no
Pains, could recover him: So that the <HI>Czar,</HI> being, at length, by his
Son's perverse Con∣duct, almost brought to an Abhorrence of his Person,
began to drop Intimations, That he wou'd cause him to be shav'd for a Monk,
and shut him up in a Convent.—The Prince's own Favourites were alarm'd
at the Danger; and earnestly entreated him to have his Wel∣fare at Heart; and
to conceal, if he cou'd not suppress, his rigorous Hatred against
Foreigners. This dispos'd him to fall in with <PB N="187" REF="196"/> the <HI>Czar</HI>'s Proposition, and he was married, as is well known, to a
Princess, of the Family of <HI>Brunswick Wolfenbuttel,</HI> and Sister to
the present Empress.</P>
<P>BUT, after he had brought her to <HI>Russia,</HI> he shew'd
not the least Complaisance; nor endeavour'd, at all, to divert
her.—On the contrary, I observ'd, That, on all Publick Occasions, he
never exchang'd a Word with her; but, industriously shun'd her Company.
The Prince had the Apartments of the right Wing; and the Princess those of
the Left: But they saw each other scarce once a Week; and, had not the
Prince consider'd the beget∣ting an Heir, as the Support of his own Safety,
he would have made himself intirely invisible to her. He even neglected the
Repair of the House, to that Degree, that the Princess lay expos'd to the
Injuries of the Air, and Wea∣ther, in her own Bedchamber.</P>
<P>WHEN the <HI>Czar</HI> expostulated with him, concerning these
Proceedings, he loaded <HI>her</HI> with Reproaches, as if it was she, who
had accus'd him; whereas, that wise Princess sub∣mitted to her hard Fate,
with the firmest Con∣stancy and Resignation; nor had any other
Witnesses of her Tears, but the Princess of <HI>East-Freisland,</HI>
her Companion, and the Walls of her own Apartment. She liv'd, four Years, in
this Manner, and was then seiz'd with an Indisposition, so dangerous,
that her Recovery was immediately despair'd of.</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="197"/>WHEN she perceiv'd her End approaching,
she desir'd to see the <HI>Czar,</HI> who was, at the same Time,
indispos'd: But he caus'd himself to be carry'd to her, in a Machine, mov'd
on Wheels.—The Princess took her Leave of him, in the most moving
Expressions; and recommended her two Children to his Care and Protection;
embracing them, in the most ten∣der manner possible; and almost melting
away in Tears. Then, she sent for her Servants, who, to the Number of two
hundred Persons, and upwards, lay prostrate, in the Anti-cham∣ber,
imploring Heaven to assist their dying Mistress, in her last
Agonies.—She comforted, admonished, and gave them her
Blessing:—The Physicians would still be pressing her, to take
some Medicines; but she threw the Glasses from her, crying out, with
great Emotion,—<HI>Do not torture me any more.—Permit me to die in
quiet.—For I am resolved to live no longer.</HI>—She expir'd, in
fervent Prayer, and depart∣ed an unfortunate Life, before she was quite one
and twenty Years old.</P>
<P>IT was soon after the Funeral of this Prin∣cess, that the <HI>Czar</HI> gave that admirable Letter, which you publish'd in a late
PAPER, into the Hands of his Son. And, what follows, is the <HI>unequal</HI>
Answer, which he had the Mortifica∣tion to receive from him.</P>

<SALUTE>Most Clement Lord, and Father,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE read your Majesty's PAPER, and have nothing to reply to
it; but, that, if your Majesty will deprive me of the Succes∣sion to the
Crown of <HI>Russia,</HI> by Reason of my Incapacity, Your <HI>Will be
done.</HI> I do not think myself fit for the Government: The Rule of so
many Nations, requires a more vigorous Man than I am.—I will not pre∣tend
to the Succession, for the future, of which I take God to Witness; and
swear it, upon my Soul, desiring nothing more than bare Maintenance, during
Life.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your most humble Servant, And Son, <HI>ALEXEI.</HI></SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>MANY further Attempts the <HI>Czar</HI> made, on his Son's
Obstinacy: But the Consequence of them all; and of his pretended
Resignation, was his Flight to a Foreign Protection, and a plunging himself
into those High Crimes which are particulariz'd, in his Sentence.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Czar,</HI> upon this extraordinary and me∣lancholy
Occasion, convok'd a High Court of Justice; consisting of all the <HI>Chief</HI> of the <HI>States.</HI> <PB N="190" REF="199"/>—He lay, for
eight Days, successively, many Hours, on his Knees; imploring God, with
Tears, to inspire him with Sentiments, becom∣ing his double Duty—as a <HI>Monarch,</HI> and as a <HI>Father.</HI>—The Prince was brought into
Court, under Guard of four Officers; and pro∣ceeded against, in a Manner too
tedious, and circumstantial, to be particulariz'd in so short a
Compass.</P>
<P>THE Court, upon the whole, having pro∣nounc'd a formal Sentence, and
condemn'd the Prince to Death, the violent Surprize and Ter∣ror of his Mind,
and the disorderly Conflict and Fluctuation of his Passions, threw him
into an Apoplectick Fit. The <HI>Czar</HI> no sooner heard, that he was in
this Danger, and that he was desirous to see him, but he visited his
dy∣ing Son, with the most visible Marks of Pity, and a Proof of Paternal
Tenderness.</P>
<P>THE Prince, at Sight of his Father, burst out into Tears; and,
with Hands, rais'd, and folded, said, 
<Q REND="inline">'He had grievously offended the Majesty of
Almighty God, and the Good∣ness of the <HI>Czar</HI>—; that he had not
even a Wish, to recover from his Indisposition, be∣ing unworthy to live
longer. He begg'd his Majesty, for God's sake, only to take from him the
Curse, he had laid on him, at <HI>Moskow:</HI> to forgive him all his heavy
Crimes; to impart him his Blessing; and, to cause Prayers to be put up
for his Soul.</Q></P>
<P>DURING these moving Words, the <HI>Czar,</HI> and the whole Court,
almost melted away, in <PB N="191" REF="200"/> Tears.—His Majesty
return'd him a most no∣ble, and pathetic, Answer: He represented, in a
few, of the mildest Words, he cou'd select, all his <HI>Length</HI> of
Offences; and then, gave him, in the most touching Manner possible, his
For∣giveness, and his Blessing: After which, they parted, with abundance
of Tears, and La∣mentations, on both Sides.</P>
<P>VERY late, in the Night, came a Messen∣ger to acquaint the <HI>Czar,</HI> that the Prince was extremely desirous, once more, to see
his Fa∣ther. And his Majesty had just stept into his Sloop, to go over to
the Fortress, when ano∣ther Messenger brought News, that the Prince was
already expir'd.—He was deposited in the new Burying-Vault, of the <HI>Czarish</HI> Family; and plac'd next the Coffin of his late
Consort.—The <HI>Czar,</HI> among the Mourners, carried a lighted
Wax-Taper, in his Hand; and was observ'd to be bath'd in Tears, during the
Pro∣cession; and, in particular, at the Church Ser∣vice; where the Priest
had chose, for the Text of his Funeral Sermon, these Words of the mournful <HI>David,—O! my Son Absalom!—my Son!—my Son,
Absalom!</HI></P>
<P>YOU see, Sir! how different this Great Monarch's Conduct, in so
nice, and trying, a Circumstance, really was, from the Clouds, which <HI>Rumour</HI> blew upon it, to shade, and blacken, an <HI>unequal'd
Character!</HI>—The <HI>Roman Fierceness</HI> has been <HI>celebrated,</HI> in Men, who not only <HI>condemn'd</HI> their Sons; but
stood by, and <HI>saw</HI> 'em executed, in the most severe, 
<PB N="192" REF="201"/> and shameful Manner, for the Love and Safe∣ty of their
Country. Yet there was a <HI>Brutal Inflexibility,</HI> and a kind of <HI>Politic Necessity,</HI> in the Actions of those <HI>Roman
Fathers!</HI> But this prodigious, <HI>modern,</HI> Prince, under no In∣fluence
of Fear, Dependence, or Obligation, <HI>chose,</HI> to set aside his <HI>own Blood,</HI> for the future Glory of his <HI>People!</HI> Only, with
this fine Dif∣ference from the <HI>Roman,</HI> that, what was, <HI>there,</HI>
done, with a <HI>Stoicism,</HI> that gave Suspicion of Insensibility,
was, <HI>here,</HI> adorn'd with <HI>Pity,</HI> and the most manifest
Strugglings of an amia∣ble <HI>Weakness,</HI> that convinc'd his Subjects how <HI>Dear</HI> their Prosperity must be, to a Sovereign, who cou'd thus
provide for it, by a Sacrifice, against his Nature, even of his private, and
domestick, Comfort!</P>
<P>HAVING shewn, in the foregoing Instances, the <HI>afflicted</HI>
Side of the <HI>Czar</HI>'s Behaviour: It is but just, that I shou'd change
the Light, and surprize you, by a View of that unshaken <HI>Firmness,</HI> with which he regarded the <HI>Danger</HI> of the
Conspiracy; while the Reflection, <HI>Who was the Author of it!</HI> gave him
so moving a <HI>Misery!</HI></P>
<P>UPON the Examination, and Confessions, of that infinite Number
of Confederates, who were engag'd in the Prince's Projects, it ap∣pear'd, that
the Defection was so wide, and so general, that many of his nearest, and
most trusted Servants, were embark'd in it; and such also, in whose
Hands lay great Part of his Wealth and Power; so that he was congra∣tulated 
<PB N="193" REF="202"/> in Form, by the Ambassadors of Fo∣reign Princes,
upon his Discovery, and Pre∣vention, of so endangering a Combination. To
which, he gave this noble Answer—<HI>Dan∣gers always are strong, if
they are weakly resist∣ed:—Where a Fire meets with Straw, it soon
spreads, and burns through it.—But, if Iron lies in its Way, it falls
back, and is extinguish'd!</HI></P>

<P>WITH the Leave of the <HI>Grammarians,</HI> I shall venture to put
one of their <HI>Moods</HI> a little upon the Rack; while I affirm, in a kind
of Riddle, for the Use and Pleasure of my Reader—That, tho' every
Body <HI>may</HI> be Happy, yet scarce any Body <HI>can</HI> be so.</P>
<P>THERE is no Definite Point, that we can fix at, when we wou'd
describe <HI>what Happi∣ness is</HI>; yet the Road, to this great Journey's
End is very Short, and Obvious. One wou'd wonder therefore, how it comes to be
so uni∣versally <PB N="194" REF="203"/> mistaken, if it were not easily
observ'd, that most Men are under an Error, even as to the very Placing
it.—<HI>Happiness</HI> is seated, not in <HI>Power,</HI> but in <HI>Will.</HI>—Though very few can be <HI>Fortunate,</HI> yet all Men may
be <HI>Sa∣tisfy'd:</HI> And they, who lessen their Desires, have, in one
great Point, the Advantage, over those who enlarge their Prosperity; for,
allow∣ing both to be equally Happy, yet the First, at least, are Happy,
with less Danger, and In∣cumbrance.</P>
<P>WHOEVER can be so wise, as to content himself with his present
Lot, while he, patient∣ly, hopes a better, will escape the common Fate, of
tasting, with Disrelish, what he finds within his Reach, from a
restless and devour∣ing Thirst after what is Future, and
Uncer∣tain—Life slides from the Impatient, like the Motion of a
murmuring Brook; where the Cur∣rent wastes much faster, than if the Surface
had been smooth, and silent.—When we are upon the Brink of the Grave,
we start,—and wonder at our Situation! And, then, first, be∣gin to
look back, with Shame, and Sorrow, at the too Little we have <HI>Done,</HI> in
Life; and the too Much, we have <HI>wish'd,</HI> in it.</P>

<L>And, marking both Extreams, pass, clear, between.</L>

<L><HI>All</HI> were Enough.—But less, than <HI>All,</HI> is <HI>None.</HI></L> 
<L>This my first Wish.—But, since 'twere wild and vain</L> 
<L>To grasp at glitt'ring Clouds, with fruitless Pain,</L> 
<L><PB N="196" REF="205"/>More safely low, let my next Prospect
be;</L> 
<L>And Life's mild Evening this fair Sun-set see.</L> 
<L>Far from a <HI>Lord</HI>'s loath'd Neighbourhood,—a State,</L>

<L>Whose <HI>Little</HI> Greatness is a Pride I hate!</L> 
<L>On some lone <HI>Wild,</HI> shou'd my strong House be
plac'd;</L> 
<L>Surrounded by a vast, and healthy, <HI>Waste.</HI></L> 
<L>Steril, and coarse, the untry'd Soil shou'd be:</L> 
<L>But forc'd to flourish; and subdu'd by <HI>me.</HI></L> 
<L>Seas, Woods, Meads, Mountains, Gardens, Streams &amp; Skies,</L> 
<L>Shou'd, with a changeful Grandeur, charm my Eyes.</L> 
<L>Still, where I mov'd, new Marks of my past Pains,</L> 
<L>Shou'd plume the Mountain Tops, and paint the Plains,</L> 
<L>Greatly Obscure, and shunning <HI>Courts,</HI> or <HI>Name,</HI></L> 
<L>Widely befriended, but escaping <HI>Fame:</HI></L> 
<L>Peaceful in studious Quiet, wou'd I live;</L> 
<L>Lie hid, for Leisure; and grow Rich, to <HI>give.</HI></L> </Q>
<P>I AM sure, I wish no Ill to the Author of the <HI>Manuscript,</HI> from which I took these Ver∣ses; because, to say
Truth, he is the most In∣timate of all my Acquaintance;—yet, I
fore∣see an inexhaustible Provision of Disappoint∣ments in Store, for a
Mind, that is so un∣stable, as to afflict itself with other's Sorrows,
when there are Domestick ones, more than enow, in the happiest Man's
Condition, to interweave, and make Checquer-work of, the richest Robes of
Fortune.</P>
<P>I REMEMBER a pleasant Fancy, in <HI>Plu∣tarch's Feast of the Seven
Wise Men,</HI> concern∣ing the Limits we shou'd set to our
Desires.—
<Q REND="inline">'If a Person, (says the Speaker) is a Man of 
<PB N="197" REF="206"/> Wisdom and Gravity, he wants no Rule but his Reason,
to prescribe him a proper Mea∣sure: But, if a <HI>Fool</HI> were to ask me
the Que∣stion, I would tell him this Story.—The Moon, upon a Time, was
very earnest with her Mother, that she wou'd make her a new Pet∣ticoat,
that might sit handsomely about her; and be neither too short, nor too
long, for her Body:—But how is that <HI>possible,</HI> an∣swer'd
the Mother, with some Emotion, when thou art always changing Shapes, and
never contented with thy own Figure?</Q></P>
<P>THERE is a restless and universal, Circu∣lation of Discontent,
in all Degrees, and Con∣ditions;—The Rich Man is miscrable, because
he has no <HI>Heirs</HI>; and wishes himself but so bless'd, as the
poor <HI>Labourer</HI>; who cries out, while he trims his Hedges, that he cou'd
be happy and live comfortably, if he had <HI>no Chil∣dren,</HI> to provide
for!—The Citizen sighs, with Envy, at the Smell of a new Hay-cock; and
longs to wind himself out of Business, that he may enjoy Life in the
Country!—The Coun∣try Gentleman finds his Time the most heavy, of all
his Cares; and dreams, for ever, of the Delights, which he cou'd pass it in,
at <HI>London!</HI>—The <HI>great</HI> Man complains, that he is
wretch∣ed, from too much Notice; and the <HI>good</HI> Man is really so, from
too little.—Command is full of Cares; and Dependance pinch'd with
Mise∣ries! Every Body repines at some Deficiency in his own Fortune, and
has something to wish for, from another, who is still less
satisfy'd!</P>
<P><PB N="198" REF="207"/>DISTANT Prospects are most pleasing; but
they seldom fail to deceive us. The rough Lines, and Ruggednesses, which
look smooth, a great Way off, perplex, and entangle, us, when we find
ourselves among them.—I have often been entertain'd, by an ingenious <HI>Italian</HI> Emblem, where, to satirize the Levity of this insatiate
Disposition, Boys are painted very busy, running about, with erected
Faces, to pursue, and catch at Bubbles; which are blown down, among them, by
a Monkey, with a long Pipe, and a Bason.—The Boys, who are suppos'd
to have grasp'd some, look amaz'd, and disappointed, that they are
va∣nish'd, in the catching! And the <HI>Motto,</HI> un∣der-written,
is—<HI>He, who reaches me, loses me.</HI></P>
<P>PERHAPS, it might deserve to be remem∣ber'd, as a Maxim, That <HI>nothing ought to af∣flict us, which it is absolutely out of our Power to
remedy.</HI>—If it were as easy to regulate our Lives, by this Rule, as
it is reasonable to ap∣prove it, much the largest Part of our Calami∣ties
wou'd, at once, be cut off, and effectual∣ly prevented, for the
future.—It is certainly an Ambition, not only <HI>just,</HI> but <HI>noble,</HI> to pursue the honest Calls, either of Fortune, or of Glory:
But, if we cou'd pursue 'em, with such Pati∣ence, and Moderation of
Desire, as not to lose, in the Interim, all Relish of our present
Con∣dition; not to place our only Happiness, in at∣tempting to become <HI>more</HI> happy; but content ourselves with what we are, from the
Prospect <PB N="199" REF="208"/> of what we hope to be:—All the
Bitterness of Adversity wou'd lose its Taste, in our Use of it; and
Prosperity become less envied, than Peace of Mind and Tranquillity.</P>
<P>BUT this, however possible to Nature, is impossible to Pride
and Custom—Things, indifferent, in themselves, become hateful, or
amiable, from their Consequences.—The Re∣putation, that follows Wealth,
gives the sharpest Pain to Poverty: And a Man who is brave enough to
provoke Danger, and Death, shall want Courage to bear Contempt, though but an
imaginary Evil!</P>
<P><HI>HATEMTAI,</HI> says the <HI>Arabian</HI> History, was the
most bountiful, of all Mankind; and was flatter'd, by a Train of Followers,
with continual Flights of Praise, and Congratulati∣ons of his Good
Fortune.—They were ask∣ing him one Day, 
<Q REND="inline">'Whether, ever, he had seen, or heard of, any Man,
who had so noble a Soul, as <HI>Hatemtai?</HI>—He smil'd, and
return'd this Answer:—I walk'd out into the Fields, on a certain Time,
when, at a Sacrifice of a Hundred Camels, my House was fill'd, by my Order,
with all the Poor, and the Miserable, who cou'd be found, in the Space of
many Miles round my Dwelling.—Some of the Lords in my Company,
dis∣cern'd, at a little Distance, a Man, who was very busy, in gathering
up a Bundle of dry Thorns, to sell, at the next Village. We went to him and
ask'd, why he was not among the Number of his Fellows, who were 
<PB N="200" REF="209"/> feasting at the House of <HI>Hatemtai?—Be∣cause,</HI> answer'd he, <HI>a Man, who can provide
himself with Bread, by his own Labour, needs not be oblig'd to</HI>
Hatemtai.—This Man, <HI>said he,</HI> had a Nobler Soul, than <HI>Hatemtai.</HI></Q></P>
<P>I WALK'D, lately, into the City, toward the Close of the Day, and
observing a Church open, went in, to Evening Prayers. I sat near a Lady,
whose fine Face, methought, appear'd like the Seat of a long War, between <HI>Beauty,</HI> and <HI>Affliction.</HI> She saw, that I had no Prayer-Book,
and modestly offer'd me her own. I kept it, during the Service, and took
Plea∣sure to charge my Memory with the Eight following Lines, which were
written, in a Woman's Hand, on a white Leaf, at the Be∣ginning; and were, I
believe, of her own com∣posing.</P>
<Q> 
<L>Here, tracing Duty's Path, redeem'd from Care,</L> 
<L>I heal my Sorrow, with the Balm of Prayer:</L> 
<L>Patience, that arms the Mind for every State,</L> 
<L>Has taught me, not to feel Affliction's Weight.</L> 
<L>They, who can, bravely, bear the Woes of Life,</L> 
<L>Steer, safe and steady, through a Sea of Strife.</L> 
<L>While they, who pine their Hope, to feed their Grief,</L> 
<L>Embosom Anguish; and resist Relief.</L> </Q>
<P>THIS was a fine, and useful Lesson; and not improperly plac'd.
But it was pity that she learnt is not soon enough to protect her against
those Passions, which had left their Traces too visibly on her Eyes,
her Air, and her Complexion.</P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="210"/>THE World, upon the whole, may be di∣vided into
two Classes;—The one seldom Find, what they are, always, painfully
Seek∣ing: The other Find it, easily, but are never the more
Contented.—Among many Remark∣able Proverbs, which are proper to the <HI>Eastern</HI> People, they have one to our present Purpose.—
<Q REND="inline">'<HI>There are only two Things which can fill the
Covetous Man's Eye</HI>;—Discretion:—Or the Earth that his
Corpse must be cover'd with.</Q></P>
<P>AFTER all that can be said of <HI>Riches</HI>; or, that is the
Consequence of their Possession:—<HI>Content</HI> is the
surest Comfort.—It is Luxury, that <HI>creates</HI> Poverty; and they
are Rich, who desire Nothing.</P>

What d'ye call it?</HI>—One of those People with an ill-favour'd Name,

against <HI>Man:</HI> But, alas!—He is not Man!—He is a Being
more refin'd: and I am wretched, without Remedy!—I have heard some
Peo∣ple report Things, to his Prejudice; but I dare swear it was all
Envy.—The Men, to be sure, cou'd never endure him, because the Women
were so pleas'd with him; and be∣sides, he <HI>sings</HI> so much

wou'd fain know what they mean, by laughing, when I mention the Value I have
for him; and saying, with a waggish Look, that <HI>no Lion will eat a
Lion?</HI>—However heartily I love him, I did not tell 'em, I wou'd <HI>eat</HI> him.—But I suppose they mean something, that, I

finds any thing in the Paper, that he is mightily taken with, he makes no
Scruple of convincing me, that <HI>he</HI> is as <HI>taking,</HI> as the
Paper;—that is to say, he puts it up, and carries it away with him, to
divert his Club, or his Mistress.—So, he has Two-pence in Wit; and
Two-pence, in Liquor: Yet, pays me only for the Li∣quor!—as if Wit were
worth Nothing!—I am serv'd thus, so often, that, though your Papers
come out, but twice a Week, I take 'em in, twice a Day; as my <HI>Account-Book</HI> can make appear, by very woeful Ex∣perience.—Now,
what I want you to say, <PB N="205" REF="214"/> to these light-finger'd

<P>I AM a sort of silly <HI>Coquet</HI>; but not so happy a one,

<P>I discharged some random Shot, among the Wild-Fowl, at our

the Foot Guards; and a <HI>Canary-Bird,</HI> called a Templer.—The
Templer was a Wit; and, I speak it, with a Sigh,—a charming
one!—He was vain, conscious, chearful, and as false, as my own Smiles
were.—My Foot Officer was serious, honest, friendly: but I thought,
he was too Dull.—I receiv'd both their Addresses, but not with equal
Sensibility: The <HI>Soldier,</HI> I slight∣ed, <PB N="206" REF="215"/> but

bid farewel to <HI>Epsom,</HI> without taking Leave of me, to follow a Flirt
of a Fortune, that was hoyden'd away, to <HI>London.</HI>—But, what gave
me a double Sense, as well of my Error, as my Shame, was, that, the Evening

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM a most <HI>Catonick</HI> Adherer to the Old, <HI>English,</HI> Simplicity; the Vertue, the Blunt∣ness, and the Liberty,
which were the Or∣naments of our Ancestors.—I have taken some Pains
to prove, that <HI>we Britons,</HI> shou'd not only be <HI>left Free</HI>;
but, that we <HI>ought</HI> to be left <HI>Rough,</HI> too.—I am not
able, there∣fore, to resist the Indignation, that rises in me, at the too
visible Encrease, in the Num∣ber of our <HI>Courtiers.</HI>—It is
natural for our Gentry, to love to shine, in that gay Light: But, why
should <HI>Tradesmen</HI> be corrupted by the Taste of undue
Dignity?—I cannot walk the Streets, but I see fresh Instances, in
every Corner, of the spreading Power of Preferment. The Court Verge, of old, 
<PB N="208" REF="217"/> reach'd, I think, but to <HI>Charing-Cross.</HI>—Of late, it is <HI>ek'd</HI> out, to <HI>White-Chapel,</HI> and <HI>Norton-Folgate.</HI> Nay, I have been credi∣bly
inform'd, that there are Courtiers of great Eminence, in and about <HI>Hockley
in the Hole</HI>!</P>
<P>I SHOU'D not be so averse to this En∣crease of the Royal
Retinue, if his Majesty's Ease, or Interest, were, proportionably,
en∣larg'd by it.—Thus, it is neither Useless, nor Uncomely, for a
Prince to have his <HI>Cow-House:</HI> But there is another Court
Establish∣ment, which little can be said in support of, and that is,
the <HI>King's Ass-House.</HI>—His Honour, of this Office, holds his
Re∣sidence, in the Road to <HI>Hide-Park-Corner:</HI> It being Decent, he
says, that his Dwelling shou'd be near his Duty; and where he may be under
the Eye of his Fellow Statesmen.—I was the other Day at an odd
Christ'ning, in one of the Horns of this huge City, where, a newly preferr'd
Court Lady was complain∣ing, to her Sister Gossips, How unavoid∣able it
is, in Divided Times, for those, who are distinguish'd by Court Favours,
to have the <HI>Disaffected</HI> for their Enemies.—I whi∣sper'd a
grave Gentlewoman, to know, what <HI>Post</HI> that great Lady held? And was
an∣swer'd, with becoming Seriousness, that she was marry'd to the <HI>King</HI>'s <HI>Mustard-maker.</HI></P>
<P>HIS Majesty's <HI>Oculist, in Extraordinary,</HI> lately
departing this Life, I am glad, it has <PB N="209" REF="218"/> been resolv'd,
to abolish that High Station: Nothing being more dangerous to the Peace of a
Body Politic, than to multiply Officers, without Office.—Yet, there are
not wanting imprudent People, who have Hopes of in∣stituting a <HI>Royal
Mantua-maker,</HI> in Place of the defunct <HI>Oculist.</HI>—Now, it is
quite a dif∣ferent Case, where Commissions are really useful: No good
Subject, for Example, can think much of the <HI>King</HI>'s <HI>Pudding-maker,</HI> and a great deal might be said, in Honour of the <HI>King</HI>'s <HI>Punch-house.</HI>—The <HI>Royal
Chimney-sweeper</HI> is a Minister, not of Rank only, but Necessity:
and something like it may be offer'd, in Behalf of <HI>His Majesty</HI>'s <HI>Butter-Woman.</HI>—But I wou'd be glad to be inform'd, what serious
Pretence can be urg'd, by any Man, who makes a Conscience of his Arguments,
in Defence of the <HI>Royal Gin∣shop?</HI>—Or, who can assert the
Benefit, or, indeed, the Propriety, of the <HI>King</HI>'s <HI>Royal
Riding-hood Woman?</HI> Or, <HI>His Majesty</HI>'s <HI>sworn
Staymaker?</HI></P>
<P>TO speak with the good old Bluntness of a <HI>Briton,</HI>
these are some of the luxuriant <HI>Ex∣crescences</HI> of Monarchy; and
wou'd, in the watchful Times of our Forefathers, have been par'd away, for the
Publick Benefit. And I will take it upon me to averr, that, unless some
seasonable Restraint be soon put upon this growing Evil, the Courtiers
will set up Shops in the very Heart of the City; where, if, among their other
Customs, they <PB N="210" REF="219"/> shou'd introduce their <HI>way of

but, to borrow a Phrase of <HI>Shakespeare</HI>'s, it is <HI>sicklied
over,</HI> with Affectation.—When he had felt my Husband's Pulse, and
gone through his Course of Questions, he turn'd, from whispering Mr. <HI>Juniper,</HI> who was in wait∣ing, at his Elbow; and said to me, with a
physical Air, not the Air of a Physician,—<HI>Maam</HI>!—I have
order'd <HI>Mr. What's his Name</HI> here, your Spouse's Apothecary, to <HI>Phlebotomize</HI> him, to Morrow Morning.—<HI>To do what to me?</HI>
cry'd my poor Husband, <PB N="211" REF="220"/> starting up, in his
Bed—<HI>I will never con∣sent to suffer it—No,—I am not,
I thank God, in so desperate a Condition, as to under∣go such a damnable
Operation as that is.</HI>—As <HI>what is?</HI> my Dear,—answer'd
I, half smile∣ing,—The Doctor wou'd only have you <HI>blooded.</HI>—Ay,—for <HI>bleeding,</HI> reply'd he, <HI>I like
it well enough.—But, for that other Thing he order'd, I will sooner
die, than submit to it.</HI></P>
<P>NOW, Good Sir!—cannot such a useful Mass of Learning, as
distinguishes <HI>Doctor Fossile,</HI> render him capable of
discerning, and correcting, this odd Weakness?—It exposes him to
the Ridicule of malicious Persons, who, hating a Merit, they despair of
ever equalling, are glad to depreciate his Character, by make∣ing the Worst
of his Particularity.—Since <HI>Ars est celare Artem,</HI> the Doctor
wou'd be thought more learn'd, if he less endeavour'd to display his
Learning. I know, I have made a forc'd Application of my little <HI>Latin</HI>
Sentence; yet, it will do, well enough, too, in the Sense that I have given
it.—I am,</P>

<P>THE Writer of the <HI>Rehearsal,</HI> puts in∣to the Mouth of Mr. <HI>Bayes,</HI> with regard to the <HI>Good</HI> to be <HI>extracted</HI> from <HI>Books,</HI> by the most <HI>indifferent</HI> Hands, a Truth, that might
have been spoken by a Person, whose Air of Gravity, was not (like that of
Mr. <HI>Bayes,</HI>) in∣tended to make him Ridiculous.</P>
<P>HOW far was I from thinking Mr. <HI>Jyngle</HI> the most Eligible
Companion in the World, when I met him at Sir <HI>Portly</HI>'s? And yet this
very Mr. <HI>Jyngle,</HI> (for I will take heed how I an∣ger so touchy a
Philologist, by mis-spelling his Name any more, with a broad-back'd <HI>Gothick</HI> G, as he calls it) no sooner became my Cor∣respondent, but
he proved himself a Man of more than ordinary Parts, and one whose Ta∣lents
are new and uncommon. I may liken him to some curious Engine, of great Use
to me in my Writing-Capacity; and very neces∣sary <PB N="213" REF="222"/> in
the Machinery of some Inventions which I shall make known in the Course
of these PAPERS, for the Benefit of those, who have contracted an ill Habit
of Humour, and are sickly in their Understanding.</P>
<P>I EXPRESS myself, with much Serious∣ness, when I declare, as I
here do, that I know not one Science, so Advantageous in <HI>Theory,</HI> as
Mr. <HI>Jyngle</HI>'s New System of <HI>Mind Midwife∣ry.</HI> If this lucky
Gentleman can but make it answer in <HI>Practice,</HI> according to the
vast Idea's I conceive of its Excellence and Use, he will be as much
superior to <HI>Hippocrates</HI> as the Soul is to the Body. Now, <HI>Hippocrates,</HI> as Sir <HI>Clouterly Rumble,</HI> in one of his <HI>Physical</HI> Treatises, informs us, was complimented with <HI>Divine</HI> Honours, just as his Predecessor <HI>Aes∣culapius</HI>
had been erected to the Dignity of a <HI>Demi-God,</HI> from so <HI>low</HI>
a setting out, as that of a <HI>Tooth-drawer.</HI> As mean a Conception,
therefore, as I, or any of my <HI>Readers,</HI> might have, too hastily,
entertained of Mr. <HI>Jyngle,</HI> as a mere Repeater of his own Rhimes, there
is now ample Room for forming great Idea's of his Abilities, and of the
Preferment, he may come to, since he is, the Inventor, and will, in all
Probability, be the Perfecter of this <HI>more noble Art of Healing.</HI> And
if, in the very Infancy of his Science, he makes a thorough Cure of his
desperate Patient Sir <HI>Clouterly</HI>; I do verily think, after that,
there will not be the least Room for any <HI>sick minded</HI> Person
what∣soever, to despair of Success under his <HI>Regimen.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="214" REF="223"/>HOWEVER, since a Person must be in a <HI>painful</HI> way indeed, before he <HI>cries out</HI> for the Physician,
I would propound a kind of <HI>Diet</HI> to those who discover Symptoms of
any ap∣proaching Spiritual Malady, which will serve them by way of
Prevention. This Method is certainly preferable to the common way of Delaying
till the Disease is actually upon them, which is then in Danger of not
being removed, without Recourse to violent Reme∣dies. In Sir <HI>Clouterly</HI>'s Case, the Prescription of Mr. <HI>Jyngle</HI> is so
very ungentle, that Fair Ladies, who find themselves a going into any <HI>Immoral Habit,</HI> should, one would think, take early Care to stop
the Progress of it, for fear of lying under the Necessity of such
dreadful Emeticks. That, it seems, which the <HI>Titled</HI> Patient must
be forced to undergo, for the Cure of <HI>Vanity</HI> only, (and, what
Person, with a <HI>Title,</HI> thinks <HI>Vanity</HI> so <HI>great</HI> an <HI>Ill?</HI>) will, he confesses, be attended with such violent
Workings, that it will make him <HI>vomit his Heart up.</HI> Now, who would not
avoid this rough Handling, by taking Things in Time, when they apprehend a
Disorder to be rising, and observing a regular <HI>Mind-Diet.</HI></P>
<P>I SHALL proceed, to lay down some ge∣neral Rules, and short
Recipes, by way of Spe∣cimen, that the Ladies, especially, may encou∣rage a
Pocket Volume, which I intend short∣ly to publish, on the Subject of <HI>Mind-Labours,</HI> and <HI>Deliveries,</HI> and which I only wish may be
dispersed into as many Hands as <HI>Culpeper</HI>'s Mid∣wifery; 
<PB N="215" REF="224"/> for I am sure I may say, without Boasting, it will
be a more useful and valua∣ble Treatise.</P>
<P>PERSONS, who have any Consideration for the Health of their Minds,
are desired to re∣flect <HI>Seriously,</HI> that all <HI>Excessive
Passions</HI> are <HI>Distempers</HI> of the <HI>Mind</HI>; and but <HI>Fore-runners</HI> of <HI>Diseases</HI> in the <HI>Body.</HI> Let them
know, that nothing conduces more, to the Restraint of these <HI>Humours,</HI> (which grow peccant and per¦nicious, the very Moment they
become Inor∣dinate,) than Exercise in the Thinking Fa∣culty.</P>
<P>READING the Salutary Maxims of Wise Men, with Attention, digesting
them by Me∣ditation, and imprinting them on the Memory, by frequent
Recollection, is a <HI>Mind-Diet</HI> or <HI>Regimen,</HI> which will, in a
short Time, restore Health to a decayed Constitution, and add incredible
Vigour, to a Weak and Languishing Understanding. Minds the best arm'd,
are not always Invulnerable: There are constantly some peevish Accidents,
some cross and fret∣ful Disappointments, in the rugged Road of Life, to
throw a Cloud over the serenest, and discompose the most equal
Tempers. But, there is not methinks, a quicker or sweeter Re∣medy than to
step to the Closet, and take down a <HI>moral Draught,</HI> which will
smooth us into the most perfect Calm. <HI>Gallus, Tibullus, Ovid,
Catullus,</HI> will afford us <HI>Lenitives</HI>; and <HI>Horace, Juvenal</HI>
and <HI>Persius,</HI> will furnish us with <HI>Cor∣rosives,</HI> so
that we may find a Cure for every <PB N="216" REF="225"/> Distemper. There are
not any Infirmities, Pains, or Sufferings of the Mind, but what the Writings of
some of these Doctors contain proper <HI>Specificks</HI> for. The best of
this Method of prescribing, is, that the Physick is easy and delightful.
For what does it consist in but Exercising one's Wits with some of the
best Company in the World, whom even Ladies cannot go to for Diversion,
without finding them at the same Time useful, or visit for
Instruc∣tion, without finding them agreeable. <HI>Dry∣den, Congreve,</HI>
&amp;c. Have made them refined <HI>Englishmen,</HI> and our <HI>Modern</HI>
Beauties have the same Advantages in their <HI>Translations,</HI> the <HI>Ro∣man</HI> Ladies had in the <HI>Originals.</HI></P>
<P>WHY should it not be the Care of profess'd <HI>Visiters,</HI>
not to contract ill Habits which are always very catching, and fill the Mind,
with Spots and Blemishes? a Toast that never had the Small-Pox, would be in
a Pannick, at the Appearance of a Face newly mark'd; and Per∣sons who break
out with Detraction, have the Small-Pox of the Mind, and are frightful when the
Marks are upon them.</P>
<P>YOU shall see a Young Creature torture her∣self into Beauty
punish herself to please her Lover, and skin her Face for a Complexion;
And yet, tho' she knows she is a little Vixen in her Nature, she shall
not so much as once, after she is married to him, endeavour to learn, how
she may avoid the praeternatural <HI>Palenesses</HI> and <HI>Flushings,</HI> which Anger excites in a Beautiful Countenance, giving
the whole Form of it such <PB N="217" REF="226"/> a contrary Cast, that it
is enough to terrify all Beholders. Whenever any of these blooming Bustlers
begin to bluster, the Husband may be the Physician; for, when the fiery
Par∣ticles within them betray any of the <HI>Soft</HI> Things to an unbecoming
Fit of <HI>Rage,</HI> the Sight of a Looking-Glass, at that Critical Minute
of De∣formity, has been prescribed by our Fore∣fathers with admirable, and
neverfailing Effect. But this is only a transitory Cure, and does not go to
the Root of the Disease. There are Pas∣sages relating to the Effects of <HI>Anger</HI> in a mar∣ried State, that would place their <HI>Inside</HI> as
clear∣ly before them. A Lady, whom this Practice would not work into
Gentleness of Temper, could never be cured of so violent an Inflam∣mation,
but by one of Mr. <HI>Jyngle</HI>'s severest Operations.</P>
<P>IS a Lady jealous? And will she not have Sense enough, to blush
at the Follies of Jealousy, when she is reading them, in private, and
save herself from the Inconveniency of looking frightful, in publick
Company? She stands highly in need of Mr. <HI>Jyngle.</HI> Who, that could
not <HI>read</HI> away a <HI>Fit</HI> of the <HI>Spleen,</HI> in that Excellent <HI>Modern</HI> Poem, the <HI>Rape of the Lock,</HI> could be otherwise than
given over, as quite lost, Unless Mr. <HI>Jyngle</HI> appear'd, to carry it
off, by his new Invention? Those Ladies, who have <HI>Wit</HI> enough to
plead their being of the <HI>Unfortify'd</HI> Sex in so <HI>artful</HI> a
Manner, 
<Q><PB N="218" REF="227"/> 
<L>That, if weak Women go astray,</L> 
<L>Their Stars are more in Fault, than they,</L> </Q> have likewise <HI>Wit</HI> enough, to <HI>Fortify</HI> them∣selves by proper Lectures,
against the Attacks of Passion and Folly. Therefore, after this
seasonable Warning, Mr. <HI>Jyngle is the Word</HI>; and if any wild,
disorderly, pretty Creatures, will <HI>Steal</HI> away from these <HI>Precepts,</HI> and run <HI>Gadding</HI> after their <HI>own</HI>
Inventions, till they <HI>hurt</HI> their <HI>Health</HI> and <HI>Quiet</HI>;
Care shall be taken, to send Mr. <HI>Jyngle,</HI> with all conve∣nient
Speed, after them; and <HI>he may drive as fast as he pleases, into
Practice.</HI></P>

<P>THE Loss of Friends is a Misery, which, more than any other, puts
our Patience to the Trial; and breaks in upon Human Na∣ture with a Violence not
to be resisted. All the Looks, Words, and Actions, of those, who were
dear to us, in their Life-times, rise, like Ghosts, to haunt the Memory:
But, with this Difference from their Effects, before Death had interpos'd, that
we now remember with a kind of Pleasure, the <HI>Wrongs</HI> and <HI>Slights</HI> we may have suffer'd from them, as the only Remedy we can
have Recourse to, for some Mitigation of our Sorrow: Whereas their <HI>Vertues,</HI> their <HI>Endearments,</HI> and the <HI>Good Offices</HI>
they have done us, are like <HI>Tortures</HI> to the <HI>Imagination</HI>; and
the most painful <HI>Enflamers</HI> of our <HI>Misery.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="220" REF="229"/>BUT the Tenderness of the <HI>Lovelier
Sex</HI> maintains a generous Superiority, over ours, in the Warmth, and
Softness, of their Sorrow. There is a Sweetness, in a Mother's Grief, when
she drowns her <HI>Charms</HI> in <HI>Tears,</HI> that raises <HI>Beauty</HI> into <HI>Majesty</HI>; and mixes Reve∣rence with our
Fondness for her. It is her <HI>Soul,</HI> we are, then, enamour'd of! And
the <HI>Husband, Son,</HI> or <HI>Father,</HI> of such a Mourner,
considers, with an inward Triumph, the In∣terest, he is proud to hold, in a
Heart, so grac'd by Pity; and so sincerely Sweet and Sensi∣ble.</P>
<P>THE Force of Natural Affection has its strongest Effect, in <HI>Mothers</HI> from the great Ne∣cessity there is, for that long Care,
and Pati∣ence, which are the Supports of the Human Species, during the Wants,
and Helplessness of Infancy: And the most unreasonable Par∣tialities,
of fond <HI>Mothers,</HI> to their Children, are not only Pardonable, but
Beautiful, when we consider, what good Effects are owing to the Influence of
this charming Weakness.</P>
<P><HI>SHAKESPEARE</HI>'s Tragedy, of <HI>King John,</HI> has, I hear,
been lately alter'd, with Design to bring it on the Stage next Winter. I
doubt not, but the Alterer has been careful not to rob us of the Grief of <HI>Constance,</HI> for the Loss of her Son <HI>Arthur,</HI> when in the
Hands of the King, who designs to murder him.—Being told, that she is <HI>Mad,</HI> not <HI>Sorrowful,</HI> she replies, 
<Q><PB N="221" REF="230"/> 
<L>I am not mad, Oh! wou'd to Heaven I were!</L> 
<L>If I were mad, I shou'd <HI>forget</HI> my <HI>Son.</HI></L> 
<L>— I have heard 'em say,</L> 
<L>That we shall meet, and know our Friends, in Hea∣ven:</L> 
<L>If so, I, yet, may see my Boy again.</L> 
<L>—But Sorrow's <HI>Canker</HI> will have <HI>eat</HI> his
Bloom;</L> 
<L>'Till he looks Pale, and Meagre, as a Ghost:</L> 
<L>And dies, so chang'd, that, when, in Heaven, we meet,</L> 
<L>I fear, I shall not know him!</L> </Q></P>
<P>THIS Thought, of her Son's Sorrow, and his becoming so alter'd by
it, as not to be known, if she shou'd meet him, in Heaven, has so natural
a Mixture in it, of the <HI>Tender</HI> and the <HI>Wild</HI>! Something so
exquisitely adapt∣ed both to her Character, and her Condition, that I have
always consider'd it, as one of the liveliest Strokes in the Tragedy: Tho'
it is finely supported, by what follows.</P>
<Q> 
<L><HI>Grief</HI> fills the Place up, of my absent Son,</L> 
<L>Lies in his Bed; walks with me up and down;</L> 
<L>Puts on his pretty Looks; repeats his Words;</L> 
<L>Swells out his vacant Garments with his Form.</L> 
<L>—But <HI>Memory</HI> smarts to miss him!</L> </Q>
<P>HOW much easier, and less lovely, wou'd this <HI>Constance</HI>
have appear'd, under the Afflicti∣on of her Son's Loss, had she regarded
him with the cold Indifference of a Modern <HI>Mo∣ther</HI>; whom I am glad,
for her own Sake, not to find nam'd, in the following Letter!</P>
<LETTER>
<PB N="222" REF="231"/>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE the Pleasure of a very intimate Acquaintance with that
unhappy young Gentleman, whose Verses to a Painter, you printed in one of
your PLAIN DEALERS; with a generous Remark, or two, on the Merit of the poor
Gentleman, himself, and the uncommon Cruelty of his <HI>Mother.</HI></P>
<P>PERHAPS few Things cou'd be more sur∣prizing, than a History of
his Birth and Usage!—Of two Fathers, whom he might have claim'd, and <HI>both</HI> of them <HI>Noble,</HI> he lost the <HI>Title,</HI> of the one,
and a <HI>Provision</HI> from the other's Pity, by the Means alone of this <HI>Mother!</HI> who, as if she had resolv'd, not to leave him a single
Comfort, afterwards robb'd him of <HI>herself</HI> too! and, in direct
Op∣position to the Impulse of her Natural Com∣passion, upon mistaken
Motives of a false Delicacy, shut her Memory against his Wants, and
cast him out to the severest Mi∣series; without allowing herself to
contri∣bute even such small Aid, as might at least, have preserv'd him
from Anguish; and pointed out some Path to his future In∣dustry.</P>
<P>BUT I forbear to be too particular, on any of these Heads,
because I know it wou'd give him Pain, for whose sake only I remember
them: For while Nature acts so weakly, on the Humanity of the Parent, she
seems, on the Son's side, to have doubled her <PB N="223" REF="232"/>
usual Influence. Even the most shocking Personal Repulses, and a
Series of Contempt and Injuries, received, at her Hands, through the whole
Course of his Life, have not been able to eraze, from his Heart, the
Impres∣sions of his filial Duty: Nor, which is much more strange! of his
Affection. I have known him walk, three or four times, in a dark Evening,
through the Street this <HI>Mo∣ther</HI> lives in, only for the Melancholy
Plea∣sure of looking up, at her Windows, in Hopes to catch a Moment's Sight
of her, as she might cross the Room by Candle Light.</P>
<P>HIS good Qualities, which are very nu∣merous, ought the more to be
esteem'd and cherish'd because he owes them to himself only: And,
without the Advantage of Friends, Fortune, or Education, wants nei∣ther
Knowledge nor Politeness, to deserve a <HI>Mother</HI>'s Blessing, and
adorn, rather than disgrace her.—I am strongly persuaded, from the
Character, which, upon all Occa∣sions, he has taken Pleasure to give me of
the Lady's Humanity, with regard to the rest of the World, that nothing but
her hav∣ing, much too long, already been a Stranger to such a Son, cou'd make
her satisfy'd to continue so.—It is impossible, at least, that
she shou'd not distinguish him, by some kind Notice; some little
Mark of her returning Tenderness; if, without Regard to his Me∣rit, she
knew but his Manner of thinking of her: Which is, itself, a shining Merit!
and <PB N="224" REF="233"/> a surprizing Instance of Generosity! if
con∣sider'd against those Reasons, which might excuse a different
Treatment of her.</P>
<P>He writ the following Copy of Verses, and several other, on the
same Subject, at a Time, when I know not which was most to be wonder'd
at;—That he shou'd be serene enough, for <HI>Poetry,</HI> under, the
Extremity of Ill-Fortune!—Or, that his <HI>Subject</HI> shou'd be the
Praise of her, to whom he ow'd a Life of Misery!</P>
<Q> 
<LG>
<L>Hopeless, abandon'd, aimless, and oppress'd;</L>
<L>Lost, to Delight, and, every Way, distress'd:</L>
<L>Cross his cold Bed, in wild Disorder, thrown,</L>
<L>Thus, sigh'd <HI>Alexis,</HI> friendless, and
alone.—</L>
</LG> 
<LG>
<L>Why do I breathe?—<HI>What Joy</HI> can <HI>Being</HI>
give,</L>
<L>When she, who gave me Life, forgets I Live!</L>
<L>Feels not these Wintry Blasts;—nor heeds my Smart:</L>
<L>But shuts me from the Shelter of her Heart!</L>
<L>Saw me expos'd, to Want! to Shame! to Scorn!</L>
<L>To Ills!—which make it <HI>Mis'ry</HI> to be <HI>born!</HI></L>
<L>Cast me, regardless, on the World's bleak Wild:</L>
<L>And bad me, be a <HI>Wretch,</HI> while, yet, a <HI>Child!</HI></L>
</LG> 
<LG>
<L>Where can he hope for Pity, Peace, or Rest,</L>
<L>Who moves no Softness in a <HI>Mother</HI>'s Breast?</L>
<L>Custom, Law, Reason, <HI>All!</HI> my Cause forsake:</L>
<L>And <HI>Nature sleeps,</HI> to keep my Woes <HI>awake!</HI></L>
<L>Crimes, which the <HI>Cruel</HI> scarce believe, can <HI>be,</HI></L>
<L>The <HI>Kind</HI> are guilty of, to ruin <HI>Me!</HI></L>
<L>Even she, who bore me, blasts me, with her Hate,</L>
<L>And, <HI>meant</HI> my <HI>Fortune, makes</HI> Herself my <HI>Fate!</HI></L>
</LG> 
<LG>
<PB N="225" REF="234"/>
<L>Yet has this sweet Neglecter of my Woes</L>
<L>The softest, tend'rest, Breast, that <HI>Pity</HI>
knows!</L>
<L>Her Eyes shed Mercy, wheresoe'er they shine;</L>
<L>And her Soul <HI>melts,</HI> at every Woe,—<HI>but
Mine.</HI></L>
<L>Sure, then! some secret Fate, for Guilt unwill'd,</L>
<L>Some Sentence, prae-ordain'd to be fulfill'd!</L>
<L>Plung'd me, thus deep, in Sorrow's searching Flood:</L>
<L>And wash'd me from the Mem'ry of her Blood.</L>
</LG> 
<LG>
<L>But, oh! whatever Cause has mov'd her Hate,</L>
<L>Let me but sigh, in Silence, at my Fate.</L>
<L>The <HI>God, within,</HI> perhaps, may <HI>touch</HI> her
Breast:</L>
<L>And, when <HI>she pities,</HI> who can be distress'd?</L>
</LG></Q>
<P>THEY, who are depriv'd, by Death, of their dearest Friends, and
Relations, are left wretched, in the Want of them; But they have this Comfort,
however,—that, before those Deaths, they were happier:—Whereas
this Gentleman, on the contrary, is unhappy, by his Mother's Loss, while
she is <HI>living,</HI> gay, and fortunate! and only <HI>dead,</HI> to that
Affecti∣on, which other Mothers chiefly <HI>live for!</HI></P>
<P>IF you, Mr. <HI>Plain-Dealer,</HI> wou'd give us a Paper, on these
Heads, it might, I believe, have some Effect, for the Service of a too early
Sufferer, whose Merit, and the Wrongs he has sustain'd, from his Parent's
Cruelty, entitle him to the Hope, of finding better Parents, among Strangers!
to the open Re∣proach, and Dishonour of a <HI>Mother,</HI> who, since she
has so many fine Qualites, wants, perhaps, but to be touch'd into a Sense
of <PB N="226" REF="235"/> her Mistake, to atone for it, by a generous Change,
in her Regard for him, for the fu∣ture. I am,</P>
<CLOSER>
<SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE> 
<SIGNED>Your most Humble Servant, <HI>AMINTAS.</HI></SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>I AM sorry, that, in a Nation, justly famous for Good-Nature, we
have so strong an <HI>Ex∣ception,</HI> as may be taken from this Letter.
But I will forbear, with my Correspondent's Leave, to address any
Arguments, to the <HI>Lady:</HI> Since, if she is not harden'd, beyond
Nature, the ge∣nerous Sorrow, and the Sufferings, express'd, in her Son's
Sentiments, will melt her Heart into Pity for him; and move her, more
effec∣tually, than any Thing, that can be, morally, offer'd to her.</P>
<P>I WILL turn my Advice, therefore, to the Service of those Sons and
Daughters, who are neglected, and made unhappy, by the Aver∣sion, or
Partiality, of the Parent they depend on. A Case, too common, in most
Families! and which stands in need of all the Comfort, that can be pour'd
upon their Affliction.</P>
<P>IT is a very melancholy Circumstance when this happens, as it often
does, to the finest spirited Child, of the whole Number. But it shou'd be
Ground enough for Consolation, that such Sufferers owe the wrong
Position, they appear in, to a Weakness in the Parents Reason: A kind of
Deception, in their Judg∣ment's <HI>Sight!</HI> As, when we see our Shadows, 
<PB N="227" REF="236"/> in the Water, our Heads seem to hang down∣wards; and
our lowest Parts are preferr'd, to look, unnaturally, uppermost.</P>
<P>TIME will, certainly, bring a Remedy, to those, who bear this Trial,
with Temperance: For Submission disarms the Rancour, that wou'd gather
Strength, from Exercise, by an imprudent Opposition. None, whose Injuries
are receiv'd, with Mildness, and return'd by Acts of Affection, can be, long,
without dis∣covering, and repenting, their Ingratitude. Whereas, by
permitting ourselves to <HI>revenge</HI> the Wrongs we suffer, we furnish
our Oppres∣sors with an Appearance of Justice; and only make them more
blind, when 'tis our Interest, that they shou'd see clearly.</P>
<P>IMPATIENCE under this, or any other, Affliction, does but double our
Mortification. How languid wou'd Life be, to the largest Part of the World,
if Expectation did not quicken it! <HI>Hope</HI> is the sweetest, of all
Companions!—If it leads us not to the Road, which we are most inclin'd
to travel in, its Conversation, however, is so entertaining, and agreeable,
that we can never tire, in the Journey.</P>
<P>WHEN a wicked Man is happy, he seems unworthy of his Happiness:
But, where Ver∣tue is unfortunate, it looks the larger, for the Clouds we see
it through.—There is a Courage, in Adversity, that can put Fortune out
of Countenance.—Men are not despicable, by their Fate, but, by their
Manner of support∣ing it. The Lyon has more Majesty, in his 
<PB N="228" REF="237"/> Chains, than when in the Forest: His Fierce∣ness is
reduc'd, and soften'd, by the Restraint of his Condition, and, what was <HI>terrible,</HI> in him, before, becomes <HI>venerable,</HI> by his
Calamity.</P>
<P>BUT, we shou'd not only bear our Misfor∣tunes, with <HI>Patience</HI>; we shou'd sustain 'em, too, with <HI>Silence.</HI>—Complaints are <HI>weak</HI> Mens Weapons: And, there
was something, delicate, and finely judg'd, in the Conduct of a <HI>Persian</HI> Merchant, I have read of, who, finding him∣self on the
Brink of Ruin, by a Race of Losses, that befel him, gave strict Orders,
to his Son, that he shou'd speak of it to Nobody. For, otherwise, said
he, of <HI>One</HI> Misfortune, we shall make <HI>Two—The Loss,
itself, which we com∣plain of;—and our Enemy's rejoicing at
it.</HI></P>
<P>BUT, as the most perfect Pleasures in the World are always mix'd
with Afflictions, so the sharpest Afflictions have their Uses, and
their Pleasures.—A Man's best Friend, is his <HI>Enemy!</HI> Since by
mortifying his Vanity, he adorns his Nature with Humility; and teaches him to
shun the Practice of those Ill Qualities, toward Others, which he finds
so unjust, and hateful, while he himself is oppress'd by them.</P>
<P>BUT, while I talk of Humility, I blush, at my own Pride, who wou'd
teach others a Sci∣ence, which I am myself, but a Learner in.—My
Reader, in this Case, must be so good as to compare me to a Blind Man,
with a Torch in his Hand—Though I see not my own Way, I carry Light
enough along with me, to guide the Steps of those who follow me.</P>

<SALUTE>Dearest SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE good Company, at Sir <HI>Portly</HI>'s, are at a sad Loss,
in your Absence. Mr. <HI>Tiresome,</HI> and our Friend <HI>Tony,</HI> won't
drink one another's Healths yet. But Mr. <HI>Juniper</HI> has done as strange
a Cure, upon Mr. <HI>Jyngle,</HI> as Mr. <HI>Jyngle</HI> himself intends to
do, upon Sir <HI>Clouterly Rumble.</HI>—<HI>Tony</HI> has never been
right, as he shou'd be, since you made him so asham'd of shooting his
Poetry, at Ran∣dom. He look'd very pale, Yesterday, and complain'd of a Pain
in his Stomach. There was something, he said, lay, like a Load, at his
Heart: and he had much ado to draw his Breath, for it.—Mr. <HI>Juniper</HI> felt his Pulse, and said, he hop'd there was no Dan∣ger:
Asking him, at the same Time, If he had made no <HI>Verses,</HI> for this
Week past? Mr. <HI>Jyngle</HI> told him, <HI>Yes</HI>—and repeated
six hun∣dred Lines, of a Poem, he has made a Begin∣ning in. The Verses, I
must needs say, sound∣ed as fine, as ever I heard any! But, what I
thought strange, was, that, as soon as he had done Repeating, Mr. <HI>Juniper</HI> bid him <HI>hem</HI>—and go, chearfully, about his
Busi∣ness: for his Oppression, he said, was re∣mov'd.—And it
really prov'd, as he said.—Mr. <HI>Jyngle</HI>'s Colour return'd
immediately; and he breathes, as freely as ever he did!</P>
<P>BUT, I fancy, for all this, he is not quite cur'd, yet. His
Distemper, I doubt, works inward: and, unless it has constant <HI>Vent,</HI> <PB N="231" REF="240"/> may blow up, into his Brain, and do more
Mischief, than we are aware of. For I ob∣serve, though he <HI>says</HI>
nothing, the suppress'd Spring of his Fancy twitches his Eyebrows, up and
down, and moves his Lips, like a Rabbit's!—He has got an odd Whim,
too,—the Effect, to be sure, of his Melancholy! Of untying the Knots of
People's Periwigs, who happen to sit within Reach of him! He will do the
same, by the Ladies Apron-Strings; and has made an Attempt or two, at their
Garters! Yet, is musing, all the while, without meaning any Harm in
it.—Pray send me Word, by <HI>Humphry,</HI> who rides old <HI>Robin</HI> to Town, on purpose, whe∣ther you don't think, this untying
Wigs, and Apron-Strings, an untowardly Symptom, in poor Mr. <HI>Jyngle?</HI>—Methinks, I wou'dn't, for a great deal, that his Brain
shou'd have any Thing in it.—Pray a Word, of your Advice, to, Dearest
Sir!</P>

<P>THE Answer I return'd to this apprehensive Humanity, of <HI>Will.
Weathercock,</HI> was, <HI>That I cou'd determine nothing, suddenly, in so
doubt∣ful a Case: But I desir'd him to tell</HI> Tony <HI>the following
Story, the first Time he shou'd catch him at a Wig-Knot, or an
Apron-String: and, from the Effects of it, I might judge better.</HI></P>
<Q><PB N="232" REF="241"/> AN <HI>Arabian</HI> Physician, of great
Learning, went to visit the <HI>Caliph,</HI> who took Plea∣sure in
discoursing with him, concerning Dis∣eases, and their Remedies. The
Physician was demonstrating the Necessity of Binding Madmen to prevent
Danger, from their Ex∣travagance; and the <HI>Caliph</HI> who sat, involv'd,
in the profoundest Attention, had insensibly apply'd his Fingers to the
Bottom of the Doctor's Gown; which finding a little un∣stitch'd, he had ript
it, to the very Girdle. The Doctor, observing it, made a Pause, in his
Narration.—The <HI>Caliph,</HI> then ask'd him, By what Tokens they knew,
when it was Time to Bind a Madman?—<HI>We bind him,</HI> answer'd the
Physician, <HI>when he pulls People's Cloaths to Pieces, without the

Terror of his Reasoning, nor the awful Gra∣vity of his Person, cou'd
restrain a giddy Covey, of young Female Gold-finches from fluttering their

animadvert on their Growth, and Consequence. A Nod, from you, will startle

against, in a Letter to you, from the Keeper of a certain Coffee-House, for <HI>filling my Pocket with Wit of another Man's paying for.</HI> The Truth is,

was,—<HI>They did not take in the Paper.</HI> At last, his Custo∣mers
so often ask'd for it, that he was asham'd to be longer without it; and I
continue to drink his Coffee, for the Pleasure of reading your Paper. But in
order to be even with him, I kept a private Account how many <HI>Twopences</HI>
I spent, in vain, while I was dis∣appointed by his Avarice: And just so

<P>But, since <HI>Coffee-Men</HI> must be murmuring, I will put you
in a Way to mortifie some of the <HI>Backward Ones,</HI> of that Fraternity;

notwithstanding. With a particu∣lar Description of a <HI>Pharo-Bank</HI>;
its Atten∣dants and Expences. Calculated for the <HI>Meridian</HI> of those

<SALUTE>Worthy SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I MY own self am a <HI>Barber,</HI> by Trade, but my Wife takes in <HI>Plain-work.</HI> I cou'd never endure to be Idle; and, therefore, when we
rented a little House, in the New-Buildings, I hung a Board, at my Pole's
End, with these Words writ upon it, in Great Letters, <HI>SHAVE FOR A
PENNY,</HI> Though I say it, that shou'd not, I have a clean Stroke with a
Razor: But, because I love a stirring Trade, I thought it better to work
for a little, than stand still, and get no∣thing. Now, it is a strange
Thing to consider, how little Encouragement <HI>Honest Industry</HI>
meets with.</P>
<P>ONE Evening, last Week, a Beau with a great Black-Bag at his Back,
was set down, out of a Stage-Coach; and fixing his Eye upon my Pole, put his
Hand to his Beard, and came directly to my Door, as if he meant, I shou'd
Shave him: But, as soon as he read my <HI>Rate,</HI> that was written on my <HI>Show Board,</HI> he turn'd short, upon his Heel; and cry'd out with a
silly Oath, 
<Q REND="inline">"That, <HI>Six Pence,</HI> he thought, was too
little, for a clean Shav∣ing: But, if a Man must pay for being <HI>flea'd,</HI> a <HI>Penny</HI> was too much in Conscience.</Q> </P>
<P><PB N="238" REF="247"/> I WAS quite out of Heart, at this unex∣pected
Return, for falling the Price of my Practice: And my poor Wife, who over∣heard
it, as she sat at work, fell a crying, at the Ill-Nature of it. But,
presently, we heard a jolly Voice, in the Street, <HI>Come, let us go
in:—I will encourage this Honest Fellow, though I have been shav'd
once, to Day, already.</HI> So, there came into my Shop a grave, well-dress'd
Gentleman, and a pretty Youth with him: He was kind, and talk'd very familiar
to me; and had so good-humour'd a Face, that I lov'd dearly to look upon him:
When I had done with him, he said, that I had the soft Sweep of your <HI>Turkish Barbers</HI>; and, as he was going out of my Shop he gave me a
Crown Piece; and told me, 
<Q REND="inline">"That such Industri∣ous Men, as I, ought to be
paid, as we <HI>de∣serv'd,</HI> and not, as we <HI>expected:</HI> And that no
body else shou'd <HI>Shave</HI> him, as long as his Beard grew in <HI>London.</HI></Q> </P>
<P>AS soon as he was gone, my Wife fell a crying, again.—But,
this Time it was for <HI>Joy,</HI> That in spite of <HI>Beaux</HI> and <HI>Black-Bags,</HI> there is some good <HI>Nature</HI> left in the World
yet.—If you will put this into your PLAIN DEALER, and <HI>accept of a

<HEAD TYPE="sub"><DATE>FRIDAY, <HI>July</HI> 3. 1724.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>IT is said, by a Vulgar Error, That <HI>the Eng∣lish are fond of
Novelty.</HI>—I have won∣der'd, a Thousand Times, how this Notion
became establish'd: For, that nothing is more false, in Fact, may be
proved, from our oldest Histories: and is, every Day, remarkable, in our
modern, and familiar Practice.</P>
<P>THOUGH <HI>ten Englishmen,</HI> in <HI>twelve,</HI> are the
Descendants of <HI>Foreigners,</HI> and the very Name itself, of <HI>England,</HI> is <HI>Foreign:</HI> Yet, the Noti∣on of a <HI>Foreigner</HI>
has been, always, ridicu∣lously, distastful to us!</P>
<P>INNOVATIONS were ever odious to us; and we chose rather to <HI>neglect</HI> Advantages, than to try an untrodden Path, for 'em.—What
lost <HI>England</HI> the first Possession of that Gold and Silver
World in the <HI>Spanish West-Indies,</HI> but her Disposition to
discredit <HI>Novelty?</HI>—Our very <HI>Laws</HI> depend on <HI>Precedent:</HI>—And the De∣fence, even of Rights, in Parliament, is
sup∣ported upon what <HI>has been</HI>; and seems uncon∣cern'd 
<PB N="240" REF="249"/> in <HI>why it was.</HI> Those scandalous
Op∣positions, which are so obstinately given, to the Clearest Bills,
for Publick Benefit, such, as <HI>making our Rivers Navigable,—Putting
our Lands under a Register,—Promoting untry'd Trades,</HI>—And <HI>Establishing National Fisheries:</HI> Are, all, convincing
Instances, that no Nation, under Heaven, have so fix'd an Aversion to <HI>Novelty</HI>; which, yet, every Body is imputing to us, as the Reigning
Humour of our Coun∣try.</P>
<P>BUT we have a Present Example, that will confirm my Remark, and for
ever put to Si∣lence those, who accuse us of the Love of Novelty. I mean,
the new Practice, of <HI>Ino∣culating the Small-Pox,</HI> on Bodies,
purposely, prepar'd to receive it: So, to prevent the usual Danger, and
Malignancy, of that Distemper; and sustain it, without the Terror, the
Fatali∣ty, and the Sorrow, which have heretofore, gone along with it.</P>
<P>IT was a generous Undertaking, in that Pub∣lick-spirited Member of
the <HI>Royal Society,</HI> who, resolving, by <HI>clear Matter of Fact,</HI>
to establish or explode, this Practice, has, with an unwea∣ried
Application, and the most stedfast Impar∣tiality, inform'd himself of
its Success, through∣out all Parts of the Kingdom; and given the World an
Account of it, in his Pamphlet, late∣ly publish'd. A Treatise! which
deserves the Eye, and most careful Consideration, of every Parent, who
has <HI>Reason,</HI> or who wou'd save a Favourite Child, the promis'd
Comfort of <PB N="241" REF="250"/> his Life! from being snatch'd away, perhaps
in its Bloom, by the Sweep of this Distemper.</P>
<P>IT is demonstrated, in the mention'd Trea∣tise, from a Forty
Year's Examination of the Bills of Mortality, 
<Q REND="inline">'That the Small-Pox car∣ries off, at least, <HI>one</HI> in every <HI>six,</HI> of all whom it seizes in the <HI>natural</HI> Way; whereas not one in <HI>fifty,</HI> (scarce one in many <HI>hundreds</HI>) of those who receive it by <HI>Inoculation,</HI> have been
found to die under it.</Q></P>
<P>THE whole Number of Persons, who have been so much as
suspected to owe their Deaths to it, ever since its first Introduction,
in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> amounts to <HI>Nine,</HI> only!—They are, all
nam'd, in the Printed Account; and there is scarce one among them, for
whose Death a Clearer Cause, than the Inoculation, is not assign'd, and
attested, by the very Physicians, and Surgeons, who directed the
Operation—So that Providence seems to have guided, and enlighten'd, <HI>Art,</HI> in this Practice, to assist, and relieve, <HI>Nature,</HI>
for the Preservation of the Human Species.</P>
<P>YET, with what Violence, and Malice, has it not been rail'd at, and
oppos'd?—How many False Affirmations have we seen, with unblushing
Boldness, insulting Truth, in our Publick News-Papers!—Nay, the
Pulpits, too, have trembled, under the Zeal of <HI>Reverend Railers</HI>; who,
in the holy Blindness of their Passion, have shewn us <HI>Job,</HI>
upon his Dung∣hill; <HI>inoculated,</HI> for the <HI>Small-Pox,</HI> by the <HI>De∣vil,</HI> of a Surgeon!</P>
<P><PB N="242" REF="251"/>IT has been represented, as a <HI>Wilful
Mur∣der!</HI> A new, and wicked, Presumption! An Assault on the
Prerogative of Heaven! And a taking <HI>God's own</HI> Work out of his Hands,
to be mended by <HI>Man's</HI> Arrogance!</P>
<P>BUT the Common Arguments, however des∣picable, give me Diversion,
and Entertainment.—When I hear a pious Old Woman wisely
wondering,—<HI>What this World would come to!</HI> and concluding her
Remarks with this great Maxim of Resignation, that <HI>God's own Time is
best!</HI> I compare this Force of Female Rea∣soning, to the
Representation which, a late Writer tells us, The old <HI>Boyars,</HI> or
Grandees of <HI>Russia,</HI> gravely made, to the Present <HI>Czar,</HI>
when he attempted a Communication, by Dig∣ing a Canal, between the <HI>Volga,</HI> and the <HI>Tanais.</HI>—
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>The Design,</HI> they said, <HI>was
Great;</HI>—But they humbly conceiv'd it <HI>Impious:</HI>—For, <HI>since God had made the Rivers to run one Way, Man ought not to turn them
Another.</HI></Q></P>
<P>IT is an establish'd Rule, amongst Game∣sters, That <HI>Losers shou'd have leave to speak:</HI> And, for this Reason, I
rather pity, than grow angry with an unmarried Prude or Coquet, when I catch
'em Railing at Inoculation, with a Thousand <HI>Excuses</HI> for it, in
their <HI>Faces.</HI>—As it is a Comfort to the Miserable to have
Companions in their Misery, so, it must be a Provocation, to these Fair <HI>Invalids,</HI> to hear of a Preservative, for other's Beauty, when it is
too late, to save their own by it.</P>
<P><PB N="243" REF="252"/>YET, these good Ladies, unmindful that they
carry about with them, the Cause of their own Peevishness, treat an
innocent Practice, when they join the <HI>Chorus</HI> of <HI>Railers,</HI> as
the <HI>Indian</HI> did the Looking-Glass, which he found on the
Sea-Side.—He was frightfully Ugly; and, starting back from his own
Image, threw away the Glass, in great Rage, with this com∣fortable
Observation:—<HI>I might have guess'd, thou wert good for nothing:
Thou would'st not have been left here else.</HI></P>
<P>IT is the Observation of some Historian; but I forgot where I
met with it: That <HI>Eng∣land has ow'd to Women the greatest Blessings
she has been distinguish'd by</HI>—In the Case, we are now upon,
this Reflection will stand justified.—We are indebted to the
Reason, and the Courage of a <HI>Lady,</HI> for the Introduction of this Art;
which gains such Strength in its Progress, that the Memory of its
Illustrious Foundress will be render'd Sacred, by it, to future Ages.</P>
<P>THIS Ornament of her Sex, and Country, who ennobles her own <HI>Nobility,</HI> by her Learn∣ing, Wit, and Vertues, accompanying her
Con∣sort into <HI>Turkey,</HI> observ'd the Benefit of this Practice, with
its Frequency, even among those obstinate <HI>Praedestinarians</HI>; and
brought it over, for the Service, and the Safety, of her Native <HI>England</HI>; where she consecrated its first Effects, on the
Persons of her own fine Children! And has, already, receiv'd this Glory from
it, 
<Q REND="inline">"That the Influence of her Example has reach'd as high
as the Blood Royal."</Q> And <PB N="244" REF="253"/> our noblest, and most
antient, Families, in Confirmation of her happy Judgment, add the daily

</LG>
</LG></Q>
<P>A Journey into <HI>Greece</HI> being the Subject of these Verses, <HI>Parnassus</HI> lay a little too direct∣ly in the Way.—I shou'd,
else, have been out of Humour, that the Force of the Author's Fancy took its <HI>Turn</HI> from the <HI>Pagan System:</HI> and does <HI>Apollo</HI> as
much Honour, as the <HI>Lady,</HI> who is worth a Thousand of him. But, it is
an uncommon Misfortune, to her Genius, 
<Q REND="inline">"That the only Thing in the World, worth knowing, and
not known, to <HI>her,</HI> is, <HI>her own prodigious
Excellence.</HI></Q>—So, she is nei∣ther able, nor willing, to
describe it, herself; and no Verse, but her own, can soar high enough,
for her Merit.—The <HI>sweetest</HI> of our <HI>English Poets</HI>
has endeavour'd it with less Success, than attended any of his other
Compositions: And, if a <HI>Nameless one</HI> has miss'd it, after him,
he has, at least, this Consolation, 
<Q REND="inline">"That he miscar∣ries <PB N="246" REF="255"/> in
such Company, as it is a kind of Ho∣nour to go astray with.</Q></P>
<P>I WOU'D not, however, be mistaken, in this Censure.—The
Verses, I mean, abound with <HI>Wit.</HI>—They have only an Air of
wanton Levity, that looks too merry, to be enough in Earnest, and gives the
Turn of a <HI>smiling Satire.</HI>—Praise ought always to be <HI>serious,</HI> when it is address'd to the <HI>Person prais'd,</HI>
and where the <HI>Subject</HI> is of Weight, and Dig∣nity.</P>
<P>THERE is, I know, a <HI>pert</HI> Species of <HI>Pane∣gyrick,</HI>
which has been admir'd, in the Exam∣ples of <HI>Balzac, Voiture,</HI> and other <HI>French</HI> Writers; who, when they wou'd praise <HI>Kings,</HI> and <HI>Heroes,</HI> took 'em, ironically, to <HI>Task:</HI> and <HI>chid</HI> 'em,
by way of <HI>Commendation.</HI>—But, to speak like a PLAIN DEALER,
such familiar, and smart <HI>Encomiums</HI> imply something like a
Sense of superior Qualities, in the over-conscious Bestowers of
'em.—Some of the Verses, just now hinted at, have a little too much
of the <HI>Sportive</HI>; but nothing of the <HI>French Arro∣gance.</HI></P>
<Q> 
<L>Then bravely, fair Dame,</L> 
<L>Renew the old Claim,</L> 
<L>That, to your whole Sex does belong:</L> 
<L>And let us receive</L> 
<L>From a second bright <HI>Eve,</HI></L> 
<L>The Knowledge of <HI>Right,</HI> and of <HI>Wrong.</HI></L> 
<L><PB N="247" REF="256"/>But, if the <HI>First Eve</HI></L> 
<L>Hard Doom did receive,</L> 
<L>When only <HI>One Apple</HI> had She;</L> 
<L>What a Punishment New,</L> 
<L>Must be found out for <HI>You,</HI></L> 
<L>Who have tasted, and robb'd the <HI>whole Tree?</HI></L> </Q>
<P>THIS is exquisite, and lively, <HI>Wit!</HI> But it is Wit of too <HI>brisk</HI> a Species, for the Pur∣pose it is applied to.—If a <HI>Barrister</HI> shou'd take a Fancy to <HI>dance</HI> in his <HI>Pleading,</HI> wou'd the Judge admit his <HI>Skill,</HI> in Excuse of his <HI>In∣decorum?</HI>—This Praise, so gayly given, wou'd have
surpriz'd, like a Flash of Lightning; where, instead of being the <HI>profess'd Subject,</HI> it had been struck out, <HI>unexpectedly.</HI>—As it is, it looks like Trifling; and
misrepresents the Author, as not charm'd into <HI>Reverence</HI> of the
Worth he celebrates. It speaks him Regard∣less; and but half <HI>Intent:</HI>—and is like trip∣ping, antickly, over a Drawing-Room,
when it is prepar'd for the Steps of <HI>Majesty.</HI></P>
<P>IF ever this Remark shou'd fall in the way of that Excellent Writer,
and he shou'd not, himself, think, as I do; I shall fear, I have been
mistaken. But, It is the Duty of every Man, when he assumes the <HI>Critick,</HI> to speak frankly his Opinion, what is an <HI>Error,</HI>
and what an <HI>Excellence</HI>; that his Reasons being weigh'd by the
Reader's Impartiality, may con∣tribute to produce that <HI>Judgment,</HI> which
is the sole good End of Criticism.</P>
<P><PB N="248" REF="257"/>BUT, to return to the Lady, from whose
extensive Benevolence, we receiv'd the Art we have been speaking
of;—It is a Godlight De∣light, that her Reflection must be conscious
of! when she considers, to whom we owe, 
<Q REND="inline">"That many Thousand <HI>British Lives</HI> will be
sav'd, every Year, to the Use, and Comfort, of their Country, after a
General Establish∣ment of this Practice!"</Q>—A <HI>Good!</HI> so
last∣ing, and so vast! that none, of those wide En∣dowments, and deep
Foundations, of <HI>publick Charity,</HI> which have made most Noise in the
World, deserve, at all, to be compar'd with it.</P>
<P><HI>SAADI,</HI> the <HI>Persian</HI> Author of the Work call'd <HI>Gulistan,</HI> tells a Story, of three Sages;—A <HI>Greek,</HI> an <HI>Indian,</HI> and a <HI>Persian</HI>; who, in Presence of a King of <HI>Persia,</HI> debated, on this Question. 
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>Which, of all Evils, was most
grievous?</HI>"</Q>—The <HI>Grecian</HI> said, <HI>Old-Age,</HI>
oppress'd with <HI>Poverty.</HI>—The <HI>Indian</HI> answer'd, <HI>Pain,</HI> under <HI>Impatience.</HI>—But the <HI>Persian</HI>
de∣cided it to be <HI>Death,</HI> without <HI>Good Works</HI> be∣fore it.</P>
<P>IF the want of <HI>Good Works</HI> is all, that makes <HI>Death</HI>
Terrible, the great Bestower of the mentioned Blessing cannot fail to
die, with <HI>Chearfulness.</HI>—It must be Impossible for her to
want <HI>Joy,</HI> at her last Moments: But it may be fear'd, she will
carry it away with her to the other World;—For <HI>this</HI> will be
left, in <HI>Sorrow.</HI></P>

<SALUTE><HI>Good</HI> Mr. <HI>Plain-Dealer,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM a young Widow-Woman, that was bred and born in <HI>Wapping</HI>; and, had one of the Best of Husbands; that was Master of
as good a Ship as ever us'd the <HI>Guiney-Trade.</HI> But he dy'd, in his
last Voyage, as he was bringing Home a great <HI>Elephant</HI> for a <HI>Token:</HI> And I have taken a strange Fancy to the Beast, because he
puts me in Mind of my poor Husband.—Most of our <HI>African-Company</HI> have been to see him; and they all agree, there is <HI>more in him,</HI> than in a whole Court of <HI>Assistants.</HI></P>
<P>BUT, for all he looks so big, there is no Manner of Harm in him.
He is as Tame, as one of us, Women; and plays twenty clever Tricks, to make
People merry, that make much of him.—One cou'dn't forbear laughing, tho'
one lay a dying, to see, how the good-natur'd, clumsy, Beast will dance <HI>Moll Peatly!</HI> He will so catch up his Feet, <PB N="250" REF="259"/>
and frisk round, in a small Compass; and thump the Floor, to keep Time; and
move his Back-side to the Musick! and, in short, your other End o' the
Town Dancing-Masters, are <HI>no Body at all,</HI> to him!</P>
<P>HE plays at <HI>Trap-Ball,</HI> in a Rope-Walk, by our House; and
strikes out the Ball with his Snout; and is the comicalest poor Crea∣ture
alive, to be sure!—A Gunner, and a Man of War's Chaplain of my
Acquaintance, are, now, very busy, in teaching him to <HI>dance upon the
Ropes;</HI> and I must needs say, he comes on, very towardly; only, he
look'd a little silly, at first, and tumbled off, when they cry'd, <HI>Jump, for the King</HI>; and cou'dn't keep steady, for the Life of
him.—He cracks Nuts, with his Nose: and makes a woeful Splutter, when
he gets Loose among the Herb-Womens Apple-Baskets.—All my Neighbours
love him; and tell me, that he will bring in a world of Money, if I would but <HI>make a Show of him.</HI>—Pray, what is your Opinion? And
where-abouts, do you think, it will be best for me to <HI>set up,</HI> with

<SALUTE>Honourable SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>OBSERVING by some of your <HI>Plain-Dealers,</HI> that you are a
great Admirer of the <HI>Czar</HI> of <HI>Muscovy,</HI> I humbly presume to
acquaint you, that I am, lately, come out of his Country; and have brought with
me a Commodity, call'd a <HI>Russian Bear.</HI>—He has shar'd very
largely, in the Improvements of his Fellow Subjects; for, he can fiddle, as
well as any Body; he sits bolt up on End, and holds his <HI>Kit</HI> in one
Paw, with the Butt End against his Belly; and, with his Fiddle∣stick in the
other Paw, <HI>tunes it away,</HI> after the <HI>Italian</HI> Manner, with his
Head o' one side, all in Raptures, at his own Harmony!—It wou'd do your
Heart good, to look at him, when he is splitting a Note into <HI>Graces:</HI>
For he shakes his Nose, and his Paw, together, with such a Variety of
melodious <HI>Quavering,</HI> that his <HI>Ear</HI> must be confess'd as <HI>delicate,</HI> as if he had been a <HI>Subscriber</HI> to the <HI>Opera.</HI></P>
<P>BUT, there is one Thing, that I take to be a very particular
Happiness to him! He looks, when he is Grave, for all the World, like that
Ingenious <HI>Swiss</HI> Gentleman, that has so many diverting Fancies, to
get Money, by making Ladies, and Gentlemen, merry together. If they were to be
dress'd both alike, I am confident there wou'd be no knowing 'em asunder.
May be, that may go a great Way, toward making the poor Thing's
Fortune.—I have him, here in <PB N="252" REF="261"/> Town, but he is out
of Business, at pre∣sent, so, if you cou'd but be so kind as to put
him in some Way of Preferment, he shall wait on you, where you please;
and enter∣tain you with a <HI>Sample Lesson:</HI> Which is all, that
offers, at this Time from, Honourable SIR,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Yours to Command, <HI>JONAS
QUEER.</HI></SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>I TACK this extraordinary Pair of <HI>Epistles</HI> together,
because of a manifest Resemblance in their Contents; and, for that I am
desirous to promote a <HI>Union</HI> between Mrs. <HI>Softly,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Queer.</HI>—Their <HI>Beasts,</HI> at least, if not themselves,
must be subscribed into a <HI>Joint-Stock,</HI> for the better carrying
on of their Trade.—They may afterwards debate, at Leisure, concerning
the <HI>Incorporation</HI> of their <HI>Persons.</HI> But, certain it is,
that two Animal Artists, of such Sagacity, as both the <HI>African,</HI>
and the <HI>Russian</HI> Stranger, cou'd never have honour'd <HI>London</HI> with their Residence, at a properer Time than this: Or, with
a fairer Promise, for their own Benefit.</P>
<P>SOME <HI>Statesmen,</HI> who look <HI>deep</HI> into Nati∣onal
Consequences; and discern at a Distance, the Fate of <HI>Mightiness,</HI> and <HI>Ministry,</HI> have pre∣tended to foresee
the sudden Downfall of <HI>Opera</HI>!—Who knows, if such a
melancholy Revolu∣tion shou'd befall the Polite World; but these two,
qualify'd, Performers, may take Possession <PB N="253" REF="262"/> of
that deserted Theatre; and, under the Au∣spices of so noble, and so
unanimous, a Board of Directors, out-do, even the surprizing Things, which
have already been heard, and seen, there!</P>
<P>OR, suppose, it were, <HI>yet, a Winter,</HI> before the <HI>Haymarket</HI> will be in a Condition to receive them: They cannot fail, in
the mean Time, to meet with more than reasonable Encourage∣ment, if they but
apply themselves to the Ma∣nagers, of either of our Theatres: In one, of
which, they labour under such a want of good Actors, that two such
accomplish'd Comedians (having the Advantage, too, of being <HI>foreign</HI>
Ones!) may, certainly, make their own Terms, if they are inclinable to <HI>strengthen the Youngest Company:</HI> Or, if Fortune, against her
usual Custom, most propitious to her old Favourites, shou'd dispose
their Choice another Way; they may be entertain'd, as <HI>Friends,</HI> and <HI>Allies,</HI> up∣on the Foot of well-paid Subsidies; the Com∣manding
Officers, of those <HI>Veterans,</HI> entering, lately, with much Vivacity
upon New Plans of Action, which fall, immediately, within the Genius of our
fourfooted <HI>Virtuoso</HI>'s.</P>
<P>HAVING barely touch'd this Hint for the Service of my
Correspondents, who are Per∣sons, of great Parts and Industry; I come now
to say a Word or two, in my own Person, to the Stages.</P>
<P>MUCH of the Summer is, yet, before us; and <HI>Winter,</HI> being the
Season of our Theatri∣cal Campaigning, I shall prepare myself against 
<PB N="254" REF="263"/> that Time, to take the Field, at their first Marching:
and move, with one, or other of the Bodies, during the whole Course of their
Operations. My Readers may then, expect to be entertain'd, from my private
Journal, with the Good, or Bad, Discipline, of both Armies: and the
Personal Conduct of their Generals, in the Exercises, Evolutions, Sallies,
Stratagems, or Engagements, they shall, at any Time be concern'd
in.—Let 'em therefore stand <HI>warn'd:</HI> and assure
themselves, that I shall animadvert on their Behaviour, with a Frankness,
they have been little us'd to; and lay 'em Open, like a PLAIN DEALER.</P>
<P>BUT, to enter on another Subject, I have receiv'd several Letters,
from the Female Part of my Care, to complain of my <HI>Odious Title,</HI> (so
they call it!) of PLAIN DEALER.—They had <HI>heard of me, it seems, but
did not dream I had any Thing in me.—They took my Business to have
been Politicks.—They little thought me the Man they find
me.—Instead of Humour, and Wit, they look'd for Bluntness, and
Malice, from a surly, old, Fellow, that was setting him∣self up for a
Cynick,</HI>—with a great deal more, to the same Purpose. But one
arch Flirt, among the Rest, is for <HI>forcing</HI> me to <HI>declare</HI>
myself, that People may <HI>know, what to make of me.</HI> She is at a Loss
how to think, or what to say, of my Papers; and can neither <HI>like,</HI>
nor <HI>dislike,</HI> with any Manner of <HI>Certainty,</HI> till she
hears, whether I am a <HI>Whig,</HI> or a <HI>Tory?</HI>—She adds, in a
Postscript, 
<Q REND="inline">"That, perhaps, I may think <PB N="255" REF="264"/>
indifferently of <HI>both,</HI> and pretend to an Im∣pudent <HI>Neutrality,</HI> like the Old Grasier, in our Civil Wars: who, when he
was met, on the Road, by Either of the opposite Parties, and ask'd: <HI>For
King? Or for Parliament?</HI> told 'em.—<HI>For Neither: 'till both were
wiser.</HI></Q></P>
<P>THE <HI>Hotheads,</HI> and <HI>Testimonies,</HI> of this pre∣sent
Generation, think it a Disgrace to their Vivacity, not to be as briskly in
the Wrong, as their Ancestors. And I pity, very heartily, the Condition of
the King's poor Subject, who has sent me the following Letter.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>Master <HI>PLAIN DEALER,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WISH you wou'd lend me but one Lash, or two, of your PLAIN
DEALING, for some Folks, in Red-Coats, and Others, in no Coats at all: For,
if Things go on, as they stand now, an honest Man won't be able to travel
the Road, <HI>pro,</HI> and <HI>con,</HI> for a Set of silly Busy-Bodies,
that must be medling with us, about Things, that we have other Matters to do,
than to think of. For, you must know, Master <HI>Plain-Dealer,</HI> if you
please, That I drive a peaceable Waggon, of my own; and have done so,
these Thirty Years, without being molested in my Calling: till now lately,
that a Pack of strange People have got a Whim into their Heads, <HI>to make
us Englishmen, all of one Mind:</HI>—But, if ever they bring it about,
I will be hang'd, for 'em.</P>
<P><PB N="256" REF="265"/> ABOUT Six a Clock, in the Morning on the <HI>Nine and Twentieth Day of</HI> May <HI>last,</HI> I, and my Waggon, were
met, near a Wood-Side, by a Knot, of fifty, or sixty, roaring Fellows,
stuck all over with <HI>Oaken Boughs</HI>; and loaded with Branches of the
same.—They stopt me, in the Road, to know, <HI>Whe∣ther I lov'd the
Memory of King</HI> Charles <HI>the Second.</HI>—I said, <HI>Yes, with
all my Soul.</HI>—At that Word, they fell a dancing, and set up a loud <HI>Huzzaing:</HI> waving their Hats, and their Boughs, till my Team became
frighted, and took 'em all to be bewitch'd, and was within a Hair's Breadth of
running away with my Waggon. Then, they hand∣ed me a two Quart Brandy-Bottle;
and bid me drink a Dram, <HI>To the Glorious Memory of the Restoration:</HI>
And, as soon as I had got it down, they gave a great Shout, again, stuck my
Horses, and my Waggon, all over with Green Boughs; said, I was a <HI>very
honest Fellow:</HI> and had a <HI>Heart of English Oak.</HI> And, so, we
parted, with much Ceremony, and Satisfaction, on both Sides.</P>
<P>BUT, before Eleven, the same Day, as I was driving into a Town,
where my Waggon was to <HI>Dine,</HI> there came up, in a great Rage, seven
or eight of the Troopers, that were quarter'd there; and ask'd me, <HI>What I
bush'd out my Horses for?</HI> I told 'em, <HI>To drive Flies away:</HI>
But they said I was a <HI>Jacobite Rascal,</HI>—that my <HI>Horses</HI> were guilty of <HI>High-Treason</HI>; and my Waggon ought
to be <PB N="257" REF="266"/> <HI>hang'd.</HI>—I answer'd, That it was
already <HI>drawn</HI>; and within a Yard or two, of be∣ing <HI>Quarter'd</HI>;
but as to being hang'd, It was a Compliment, we had no Occasion for, and
therefore desir'd them to take it back again, and keep it in their own Hands,
'till they had an Opportunity to make Use of it:—I had no sooner
spoke these Words, but they fell upon me, like Thun∣der, stript my Cattle
in a Twinkling; and beat me black and blue, with my own Oaken Branches.</P>
<P>THIS went off, and I thought no more of it: 'till the <HI>Tenth Day
of</HI> June <HI>came.</HI> I was then Inn'd in <HI>London</HI>; and, from
where my Waggon lay, in <HI>Holborn,</HI> I went to <HI>Soho Square,</HI> to
deliver a little Parcel, that I had brought up, for my Landlord's
Lady.—She order'd, That I should have as much Strong Beer, as I cou'd
drink, and that I should drink a Health to <HI>her
Inclinations.</HI>—She smil'd at me, and was so kind, as to give me,
out of her own Hand, a fine <HI>Nosegay of White Roses.</HI> I was very
proud of my Nosegay, for my Lady's Sake, that had given it me: And went along
the Street smelling to it, thinking all the Way as I walk'd, How pretty it
looks in your <HI>Gentry,</HI> to be so free and good-natur'd with a poor
Man, as I am: When, all of a sudden, a Scarecrow, lean Man, in a fine lac'd
Coat, snatch'd it out of my Hand, and another Gentleman in red, who was along
with Him, <PB N="258" REF="267"/> lent me a Cut cross the Shoulders, with a
cursed smarting Cane, and told me,—That he would teach such a dirty
Dog, as I was, to be smelling to <HI>Tory Roses.</HI></P>
<P>IF I could have got one of these fine Fel∣lows all alone with me,
in my Waggon, I shou'd have made him <HI>know his Driver.</HI>—But as
it was, I thought it best to shew him a good Pair of Heels for
it.—Which of us might have <HI>run</HI> fastest, in a fair Field of
Battle, I can but give a guess at.—Up∣on this Occasion, it was <HI>my</HI> Luck to be nimblest, and outstrip Both of 'em.—I don't
know, for my Part, what to make of all these Doings. They are strange Times
we live in; and as I love to be musing, when I have nothing else to do,
methinks, very often, as I travel along the Road, from one End of the Kingdom
to another, and find the People of such different Notions, I fancy my Waggon
and I are moving upon a Draft Board; <HI>Old England</HI> is turn'd <HI>Chec∣quer Work,</HI> and mix'd Black and White all over. So, wishing
Things wou'd mend, I rest, <HI>Master</HI> PLAIN DEALER,</P>

<P>I MADE a Visit, the other Day, to a Gen∣tleman, who has a
Country-House, near <HI>London</HI>; and, while we refresh'd ourselves
with a Social Glass, in a Summer Bower, which he has rais'd above the Corner
of his Garden-Wall, I observ'd him to fix his Eyes, with much Attention, on
the Gate of a stately Building, that stood on the opposite Side of the
Road.—The Mistress, said he, of that fine House, has been
charming me, all this Morning, in a Poem, which was written, in Praise of her
Extraordinary Beauty, by a very celebrated, <HI>English,</HI>
Genius.—The warm, and lively, Imagination of the Poet has plac'd her
exactly before me! I feel, methinks, the Influence of her Eyes! I am inchanted,
by her Air and Movement!—But I lose my self in Rapture, while I
seem to gaze upon <PB N="260" REF="269"/> that Spring of Youth, which he
describes with so much Wantonness! That <HI>living, thinking,</HI> Bloom!
that quickens her soft Languor; and adds Health, and Joy, to
Loveliness.—But, see!—Look yonder! The very Charmer comes,
This! this! is she: This gay, young, wish'd, ador'd dear Master-piece of
Nature; whom I have been reading of, with so much Transport.</P>
<P>I STARTED up, in great Amazement; and, inflam'd by eager Curiosity,
look'd out, to see this Prodigy.—But I beheld no other than a thin,
wither'd, stooping, old Lady; whom Two Servants, with much seeming
Difficulty, supported; and were leading along, between them, toward a Coach,
that waited for her, at the Gate. Her Head, and both her Hands, shook,
strongly, with the Palsey; but every other Part seem'd motionless, and
quite insen∣sible.—I sigh'd at the Appearance of so mortifying an
Object! And recall'd my Eyes, from aking at it, to fix 'em, reproachfully, upon
my Friend, for his ill-pointed Levity, in sporting with the Weakness, and
Misery of Human Nature.—Yet <HI>This,</HI> said he, <HI>was
once,</HI> so chang'd as we now see her! that Di∣vine! that Godlike! that
resistless Miracle! whom, to contemplate, in <HI>Dryden</HI>'s warm
De∣scription of her Influence, when the Hearts of a gay Monarch, and a Court
of Rival Lovers, were the Trophies of her Beauty, <HI>Who</HI> cou'd think,
that Time wou'd thus re∣duce her, to a <HI>Contradiction</HI> of all those
flou∣rishing <PB N="261" REF="270"/> Attractions; which, though perish'd in
the chang'd Original, will bloom, for ever, in the Poet's Picture.</P>
<P>I PROTEST, the sudden Shock, which this malicious Artfulness of my
good Friend's Mo∣rality surpriz'd and struck me with, quite damp'd, and
overwhelm'd my Chearfulness.—I sicken'd, at this <HI>too near</HI>
and <HI>naked</HI> View of Life, without its <HI>Palliatives.</HI>—I
resolv'd to drink no more.—Your Wine, said I, has lost its
Relish, and your Society is grown in∣sipid; from the tingling Thoughts
which you have fill'd me with.—So, rising for my Hat and Gloves, I took
my Leave abruptly, and walk'd homeward, cross the Fields, oppress'd with
musing Melancholy.</P>
<P>I have not, to this Moment, lost the Weight of its Oppression;
and shall never cease to wonder, That the <HI>Young</HI> reflect so
seldom on the Shortness of their Spring, when yet the <HI>Old</HI> are
always near us; and the <HI>Younger</HI> coming up behind, to push us forward
into Winter.—It was a sharp and startling An∣swer, <HI>That</HI> of
the <HI>Armenian</HI> Beggar, who, leaning double on his Staff, was ask'd by a
young jesting Coxcomb, How much that <HI>Bow</HI> had cost him? For I wou'd
be glad, said he, to buy one—<HI>Have Patience,</HI> answer'd the old
Man, <HI>and, if God prolongs your Life, you will have as good a one for
nothing.</HI></P>
<P>THERE is but one Thing Here, that can deserve our constant
Thoughts, and that is the very Thing, which we most hate to think of! 
<PB N="262" REF="271"/>—What ought, so frequently, to busy our
Remembrance, as the only sure, and unavoid∣able common Lot of ALL who ever
liv'd, who now do live; or who shall live here∣after?—Where are, now, <HI>Times past?</HI>—We toil, and strive, and labour on, through
Life, as if <HI>to live</HI> were our chief Business! Unmindful, all the
while, what empty Sha∣dows we are grasping at; and for how short a Time,
and how uncertainly they can be Ours, when we have gain'd them. What is become
of all those busy Bustlers, who have liv'd and died before us? Are they
not vanished, and forgotten? They have made their Way thro' Life, as an Eagle
does through Air; and their Path is clos'd up after them; nor have they left a
Track to follow by.</P>
<P>TIME is the greatest of all <HI>Deceivers</HI>; but deceives us,
without <HI>flattering</HI> us.—It has a Tongue in every Steeple; and
points its Finger to the Dial's Shadow, to alarm and give us Notice. But we
neglect its hourly Summons; we trust its gentle Pace, against the
Harshness of its Warning. Yet, were we wise, we should think Time a
smooth, but precipitate Current, that carries us down to Death, whether we
are bound thither, or no: And <HI>He</HI> will, always, have the roughest
Pas∣sage, who, instead of gliding quietly, will be struggling to swim
against it.</P>
<P>LIFE has nothing, that is truly desirable, but the Presence of
those we love; yet this, of all its Pleasures, is most precarious and 
<PB N="263" REF="272"/> unstable.—Are we charm'd by the Power of <HI>Beauty?</HI> Let us learn from such an Object, as the once blooming Lady,
whom I have been speaking of, that it is a false and fluid
Prospect.—It is chang'd since Yesterday; and will be further
chang'd, To-morrow.—<HI>All,</HI> that is <HI>Ours,</HI> is mutable. We
still, in∣deed, <HI>live on</HI>; but we are no longer what we have been, nor
can we continue what we are. Though the River is still known by its old Name,
its Waters, To-day, are not the same Waters that were Yesterday. Not our
Blood alone is flowing, and in constant Motion; our Faces, Strength, Health,
Comforts, Fears, Joys, Miseries, and Dangers, all move and mix us in one
Gulph, <HI>Eternity!</HI></P>
<P>I KNOW nothing so <HI>ridiculous,</HI> as what is call'd being <HI>serious:</HI> nor is any thing more <HI>idle,</HI> than what we usually
term <HI>Business.</HI>—We wou'd be <HI>fortunate, lov'd, fear'd,
great,</HI> every thing, but what we <HI>shou'd be:</HI>—For, whoever,
in this Life, proposes to be com∣pleatly happy, hopes to build, like the Men
of <HI>Babel</HI>; and wou'd raise a Pile, <HI>as high as Heaven,</HI>
without Foundation to erect it on. The World is too narrow to allow
Dimensions for a <HI>Basis,</HI> where the wild-intended Height is so
unproportionably extravagant.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mahometans,</HI> who affect, after the an∣cient Manner of the <HI>Eastern</HI> Writers, to ex∣press their Moral Doctrine, in a kind of
pro∣verbial Chain of Parallels; say, there are <HI>six</HI> Things which a
wise Man will ground no <PB N="264" REF="273"/> Hopes on:—The Colour of
a Cloud, be∣cause imaginary. The Friendship of the Co∣vetous, because
mercenary. The Love of Women, because inconstant. Beauty, be∣cause frail.
Praise, because airy: And, the Pleasures of this World, because
deceitful.</P>
<P>IT is equally to be wonder'd at, since Life is so little valuable,
and Death so certain, and unavoidable, 
<Q REND="inline">"That we should be so unrea∣sonably fond of the
One; and, so fruitlessly afraid of the Other."</Q> There is no Harbour on
this Side <HI>Death:</HI> And, the nearer we ap∣proach to those shining
Follies, which we pur∣sue with such dangerous Eagerness, the more we
multiply our Cares, and distract and weary our own Purposes. The whole
Earth is not broad enough for two proud Fools to quarrel in! whereas <HI>Death</HI> is the End of Contest, the weary Man's Repose, the great
Man's Glory, the sick Man's Health, the poor Man's Com∣fort; and a Shelter
against Wrongs and Mi∣sery.</P>
<P>SINCE a Traveller can enjoy Pleasure, by often thinking on his
Journey's End, while he is yet but upon the Road toward it; why might not Death
be made familiar to us, and disrob'd of its false Terrors, by accustoming
ourselves to look out for it? To acquaint our selves with it, at a
Distance, during our Jour∣ney, through Life to it? Life is, properly, a
Journey; but differs from our other Journeys, of less Consequence, in this
surprizing Parti∣cular, 
<Q REND="inline">"That we are travelling as fast, while 
<PB N="265" REF="274"/> we are sleeping, and intend no Progress; as, when we
are awake, and know we are moving.</Q></P>
<P>LIFE, then, being a Journey, Death, I think, may be consider'd as an <HI>Inn</HI> at the <HI>Land's End:</HI> And, since the Traveller, when he
comes thither, is still oblig'd to go farther; and must set out for
Discoveries, upon a deep and unknown Ocean; if he takes not along with him,
fit Provisions for his Voyage, he must be either a Fool or a Madman.</P>
<P>THE Difference between the <HI>Great</HI> Man, and the <HI>Good</HI>
Man, is never so plainly seen as when they, both, come to <HI>die.</HI>
Then, the one shuts his Eyes; and steps, trembling, and in the Dark, into
the Dreadfulness of Uncer∣tainty: While the other smiles, with Joy, up∣on
the Enlargement of his opening Prospect; and comes, out of a miry Labyrinth,
into Day-light, and a boundless <HI>Champian!</HI>—I sometimes take
Pleasure to consider the Birth of Man, as a Commitment of his Soul to
Pri∣son; where, during the Life of the Body, it is chain'd short, and can
move but a creeping Pace; and in limited and dusky Stages. But, it is set
free, and unfetter'd, by Death, and, at one Spring, reaches Heaven.—Such
Dis∣charge is, to the Soul, what Light is, to the Eye; when it opens Colours,
and Objects, which before, were conceal'd in Darkness.</P>
<P>Thus, then, when it is said, we <HI>die,</HI> we are rather <HI>born</HI> into real Being; we are infran∣chis'd, by the Grant of Death, and
incorpo∣rated <PB N="266" REF="275"/> among the Millions upon Millions, who have
died before us. Those we leave, are a Number, very small and
inconsiderable, in Comparison with those we go to. The Patri∣archs, the
Prophets, the Apostles, the heroick Conquerors, the shining Poets of
Antiqui∣ty, and the whole, assembled Congress, of long-known and
glorious, Characters, who have flourish'd, from the World's Creati∣on, are to
be the Company, to whose fami∣liar Converse <HI>Death</HI> will introduce
us.—And, that we may add one charming Hope, to warm and sweeten, all
the rest! <HI>There,</HI> too, we shall, perhaps, embrace, and be
restor'd to, those lost Friends, we lov'd, most dearly: and whom we
never more expected to have met with.</P>
<P>BUT, I will, now, relieve my Readers from the Severity of these
Reflections, by entertaining them with a Copy of Verses; which, I am
assur'd, were, really, written to a Lady, eminent for her Wit, and Beauty:
by a Gentleman, who thought it no Disgrace to her Loveliness, to mix his
Admiration of it, with the Memory, that she was mortal.</P>

But, as for <HI>Money,</HI> I dare be positive, that the first Time he
saves <HI>Six-pence,</HI> will be when he has but a <HI>Groat</HI> in his
Pocket. And yet this extravagant young Fellow (as I have lately been well
inform'd) has the under∣hand Impudence to <HI>make Love to my

must set himself, forsooth, to <HI>Scribbling.</HI>—Presently,
it comes into my Head, that he was writing a Love-Letter to my Daughter: And
so, pretending to mind nothing but Talking, I lean'd back in my Chair, and
overlook'd what he was doing.—But, as if the young Rogue had had Eyes in
his Elbows, he broke off what he had begun, and writ, thus, in a new
Place.—<HI>If an impertinent Old Fellow, that sits by me, did not
overlook what I am writing, I should have told you a plea∣sant
Secret</HI>—I let him alone, as far as this; but, then, being thoroughly

wou'd have him to know, that this is no laughing Matter. Mr. <HI>Wea∣thercock</HI> says, he is in the <HI>Wrong:</HI> But, that he was in

<P>MY good Friend, the Alderman, saying, he was to write to you upon
extraor∣dinary Business, makes me lay hold on this Opportunity, to ask a
little of your wise Advice, what I shall do with the Sum of Twelve Hundred
and Ninety Three Pounds Sterling, which are come back upon my Hands, by
selling out my <HI>India Stock,</HI> very seasonably, upon this
melancholy Story, that is whisper'd about, so cautiously, concern∣ing the <HI>Great Mogul</HI>'s entering into an Alli∣ance against Prince <HI>Tockmas,</HI> and the <HI>Czar</HI> <PB N="271" REF="280"/> <HI>of
Muscovy?</HI>—My Broker is for <HI>South-Sea Dipping:</HI> Because,
now, says he, it is Low-Water, in those Parts, and the Danger of Drowning
not half so great, as it was for∣merly. But, I believe, I shall stay,
till their New House is quite finish'd; and, then, perhaps, I may, for any
thing I see to the contrary, stay still a little longer: For the young
King of <HI>Spain</HI> seems to have more in his Head than ordinary. They
say he is <HI>angry with the Irish</HI> already, because of the Bustle
they made at <HI>Cadiz</HI> lately; and, if the <HI>next he falls out with</HI>
shou'd be the <HI>English, South-Sea</HI> will go near to pinch for
it.—Besides, who can tell (you know) what may happen, upon the Choice
of this <HI>New Pope?</HI> He won't let People wear good Cloaths: And, some
of our publick Prints say, that he is so horribly covetous, that he makes
the Cardinals go bald-headed, to save the Charge of buying Perriwigs! Pray,
what can be his Meaning, in all this, but only to ruin the <HI>Protestant
In-Interest,</HI> and make <HI>Stocks fall,</HI> to destroy <HI>Trade,</HI>
in downright Spite to <HI>Old England?</HI> The poor Bays-Makers, at <HI>Colchester,</HI> seem to suffer for it, already: And the Weavers that
are <HI>Up,</HI> about <HI>Columpton,</HI> have much ado to be kept <HI>Quiet</HI> at it!—Then, again, What could the <HI>French King</HI>
mean, by calling home the <HI>Marshal de Villeroy?</HI> I make no Doubt, but
there is some Mischief in <HI>that</HI> too.—In short, while Things
stand in this <PB N="272" REF="281"/> ticklish Posture, a wary Man will
think twice, before he runs into the <HI>Stocks.</HI>—Indeed, if the King
of <HI>Prussia</HI> should come over, there might be some Reason for
ven∣turing: But, as it is, I am afraid, I must lay out my Money in <HI>Lottery Tickets:</HI> For, when all comes to all, <HI>that</HI> is the only <HI>abso∣lute Certainty.</HI>—Knowing you to be a long-headed Man,

<P>THIS comes to acquaint you, That my dear Spouse is taken sick,
of a sudden, and stands in need, to the utmost Degree, of that Experience
in <HI>Mind-Midwifery,</HI> which you gave out Bills about, in your XXVIIth
Paper.—Pray, let Doctor <HI>Jyngle</HI> be sent for, immediately: And
beg him to come away, whether his Chariot is brought home or no.—We
must have him, though he comes in a Wheel-barrow.—The Bearer knows how
to bring him: And, pray, let his <HI>Emetics</HI> be such as will work deep,
and fetch up <HI>Choler,</HI> as well as <HI>Flegm.</HI>—Rage∣ing <HI>Jealousy</HI> is the Distemper: And, if the <HI>Bitter,</HI> and <HI>Green,</HI> and <HI>Yellow,</HI> that lie as low as my poor <HI>Fubsy</HI>'s Heart, is not, all, brought away by it, he had e'en as good <HI>give her a Caudle.</HI></P>
<P>BUT, unless Doctor <HI>Jyngle</HI> has better Phy∣sick, for
sick Minds, than those <HI>Poetical Pills,</HI> which you prescribe, out
of the <HI>Classi∣cal Dispensatory,</HI> I shall have little Faith in
his <HI>Modus</HI> of <HI>Practising.</HI>—I have try'd, to no
Purpose, an admirable <HI>Modern Doctor,</HI> who has given us finer <HI>Recipe's</HI> of that Kind, for Cure of either the Hot or Cold 
<PB N="274" REF="283"/> Fits of <HI>Jealousy,</HI> than the whole College of
your <HI>Ancients, Greeks,</HI> and <HI>Romans,</HI> put to∣gether.—I
love him at my Heart, and have most of his Lectures <HI>without Book.</HI>
And, I am sure, he is profoundly skill'd in my dear Love's Distemper, by
this feeling Force, with which he speaks of it: 
<Q> 
<L>Oh, Jealousy!—All other Storms are <HI>Calms</HI></L> 
<L>To <HI>Thee!</HI>—Thou <HI>Conflagration</HI> of the
Soul!</L> </Q> </P>
<P>THAT Word <HI>Conflagration,</HI> is the very Picture of my <HI>Fubsy</HI>'s Symptoms!—I had prepared, from the Salutary Works of
this learned Gentleman, a healing <HI>Linctus,</HI> that I thought infallible,
if my afflicted Deary cou'd be persuaded but to apply her Tongue to it now
and then, in order to dulcify her picquant Palate, when the acid Particles
should rise too vehemently. I had got it ready written, upon a Sheet of her
own gilt Paper; and the last Time she was taken, I gave it kindly into her
Hands, and desired her to apply it moderately. She look'd it over, with great
Composure; and I began to conceive such Hope, that I took up an untasted <HI>Sillabub,</HI> that had just been set be∣fore us, and intreated her, if
the Physick was too bitter, that she would wash down the Taste of it,
with a Sip or two of that emollient Sweetner. But the Spout was no sooner
within a Foot of her pretty Lips, when the <HI>Conflagration,</HI>
abovemention'd, <PB N="275" REF="284"/> blaz'd out at both her Eyes; and, with a
frightful flaming Face, she tore the <HI>Recipe</HI> in a thousand Pieces;
and burnt so strong, and so outragiously, that, fearing I should be
scorch'd as she flew toward me, and not be∣ing, just then, provided with
one of Mr. <HI>God∣frey</HI>'s <HI>Chymical Extinguishers,</HI> I had no Way
left to quench the Fire, but by Affusion of my <HI>Sillabub</HI>; which, very
fortunately, <HI>put her out,</HI> by the Copiousness of its Adhesion.
But I was so frighted at the Ebullition that ensued immediately upon it,
that I ran away as fast as I was able; having left her a good deal cool'd,
and in a fair Way to be extin∣guish'd.</P>
<P>I THOUGHT it proper to give you this Intelligence, how far I have
fail'd, that Doctor <HI>Jyngle</HI> may come, prepar'd, with more powerful, and
searching Remedies.—Let him make but a thorough Cure, and I'll warrant
him we do his Business. There are Nine-and-Thirty Ladies of Quality, of my <HI>Fubsy</HI>'s particular Acquaintance, who are All down, at this very
Time, of the self-same Distemper; and All taken, too, with the <HI>Conflagration,</HI> exactly as she, her∣self, is. He shall never want

a <HI>Wise.</HI>—I had been in Love above three Years, and never got
three good Words from the dear Ty∣rant; 'till I went a Fishing with her, one
hot Evening, in the Middle of last Month.—She delighted much in
Angling, out of an old Summer-House, over a River, that makes part of her own
Royalty.—Upon these Occasions, you must know, I was always her <HI>Humble Trout</HI>; and it was my Business to bait her Hooks, and sit,
and read to her while she watch'd her Fishing Rods. But, that happy
Evening, abovemention'd, I had, upon a Hint out of Doctor <HI>Donne,</HI>
compos'd three little <HI>Stanza's</HI>; and, hiding the Paper they were
waitten in, betwixt the Leaves of one of the Volumes of <HI>Dry∣den</HI>'s <HI>Miscellanies,</HI> I read her the Title, and Verses, as if they had
been part of the Print∣ed Collection.</P>

<P>IT is said, that <HI>England,</HI> within this last Century, is
grown Richer, and more Po∣tent, beyond Comparison, than in the Days of our

Weeds is a natural Indication of Strength in the Soil that breeds them. I was
reading, the other Day, That in the Reign of King <HI>Edward</HI> the Second,

the <HI>Czar of Russia,</HI> were to borrow thirty or forty thousand of

<HEAD TYPE="sub"><DATE>FRIDAY, <HI>July</HI> 17. 1724.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>I NEVER wak'd in more Harmony, and Composure of Mind, than I did
Yesterday Morning; when, rising chearfully, with my Spirits more diffused
than ordinary, I visited my Friend the <HI>Major,</HI> whose Face, as often
as I see it, makes me happier than I was be∣fore. From his firm, and steady
Temper, I learn to break the Force of my Disappoint∣ments, by the Patience
with which I receive them: And I am taught, by his Generosity, to feel the
Weight of no Misfortunes, but those which oppress my Friends, whom I love,
without being able to comfort.—When I see this Gentleman despising,
and even adorning <PB N="280" REF="289"/> himself by, his Afflictions, I am
ashamed to have ever murmured, or considered my own as burthensome.</P>
<P>I FOUND this faithful Friend reading one of my printed Papers, and
entertaining his lit∣tle Family, with all the Chearfulness of the
Fortunate.—He rose, and received me, smiling. I have been Reasoning
away some Pain, said he, by the Influence of your PLAIN DEALER. How
powerful are your Thoughts? And how happy am I in your Friendship? What a
Force of Delight comes with the Praise of those we love? It is Musick to
the Mind, and our Cares dissolve before it.</P>
<P>THE generous Fulness of his Heart, was prepared to say much more,
if I had not in∣terrupted him, by proposing a Walk into the Fields.—It
was one of those sweet, sunless Days, when, though no Place was
shelter'd, yet every Place would be shady. We had wander'd, without
designing it, 'till we found ourselves by <HI>Chelsea-College.</HI> The
Grandeur, Use, and Beauty of that Building, charm'd us into a short
Silence, which the <HI>Major</HI> broke agreeably, by these apt, and just,
Reflections.</P>
<P>THOUGH <HI>Charity</HI> is last in Rank, when we name the three
great Virtues, it stands first, methinks, in Dignity; for it seems to
include the others. There may be <HI>Faith,</HI> and <HI>Hope,</HI> where there
is no <HI>Charity</HI>; but there can be no <HI>Charity</HI> without <HI>both.</HI> It imploys <HI>Faith</HI> in the easy Credit which it allows
to affirm'd and rational Appearances: And it applies <PB N="281" REF="290"/> <HI>Hope</HI> to its own, and others Benefit, by in∣dulging an Expectation,
that all that is amiss, will mend; and Ills produce good Consequen∣ces. The
common Notion of this Virtue, centers in a contracted Beneficence toward the
Support of the Poor and Needy: And that, too, for the most Part, when the
Bestower has no longer the Power of enjoying what he parts with. Whereas <HI>Charity,</HI> in its noblest Sense, requires a Return of <HI>good
Offices,</HI> to the very Malice that oppresses us: For, it teaches us not
only to <HI>act well,</HI> but also to <HI>think generous∣ly.</HI>—It
banishes from the human Soul, all its sordid Affections; All Partiality to
our own Interests; All Attachment to our own Opinions; All Jealousies, and
low Suspicions, concerning the Designs, Words, and Actions, of those we
hear of, or converse with. It is, in short, the great Refiner, and Ennobler
of the Mind: It swells the Heart with Pity, Friendship, Justice, Pardon,
Openness, and Magnanimity; And stifles the inward Strug∣lings of
Self-preference, Revenge, Distrust, Pride, Avarice, and Ignorance.</P>
<P>THOUGH it is certain, answered I, That <HI>Charity,</HI> at full
Extent, is no less than you describe her; yet, even in the Sense most
li∣mitted, her Influence is sweet, and amiable. How wretched would many
Thousands be, through want of the most common Comforts, if Ostentation
did not borrow the white Robe of Charity, to disguise her Pride of Heart,
in the Appearance of Humility! And if the <PB N="282" REF="291"/> Miser, on
the Brink of Life, did not fill his trembling Hands with Benefits, that bless
the Destitute as effectually, as if his Will, and not his Penitence, had
urged him to bestow them!</P>
<P>HOW many want the Pity, which even an Hospital can give them? How
many return hungry, cold, weary, disappointed, and de∣spairing, to their
famish'd, and unfriended Children? What double Death would it be to an
unhoping, wanting Husband, to see the Breast of a lov'd Wife dry'd up with
killing Want; and a dying Infant held, in vain, to her insensible,
exhausted Bosom?—I know, you feel not that you can be miserable,
'till you think of the <HI>more miserable:</HI> And I should not,
therefore, haunt so apprehensive a Re∣flection, with Apparitions of
imagined Sorrow. But, how frequent would such Lots become, if not prevented
by the <HI>late,</HI> indeed, yet al∣ways <HI>welcome,</HI> Bounty, of those
Founders, even of our common Houses of Compassion? Our Monuments of
Death-Bed Bribery! to which, for the Example's sake, <HI>This</HI> World
allows the Name of Charity!</P>
<P>IT has been remarked, but, I hope, it was unjustly, That the Charity
of Women is much narrower than that of Men.—If this is true, it is an
Accident which must be owing to some Error in their Education; for Nature
meant it otherwise, and soften'd their tender Minds, to fit them for
Impressions of a mild, and pity∣ing Quality.—In all the Sculptures,
and fine Paintings of Antiquity, we see Charity repre∣sented 
<PB N="283" REF="292"/> as a smiling <HI>Woman,</HI> to shew, it is the <HI>Sex's Virtue</HI>; and, that Sweetness, Grace, and Bounty, should adorn
a Lady's Loveliness.—When I see a Woman fortunate, yet narrow-minded,
and unmerciful, I look with Scorn upon her Beauty, and think most upon the
Dross it covers. I grow angry at beholding such a gay and gilded Sepulchre,
and turn my Eyes from her shining Dust, to the more grate∣ful Earth, which
it was taken from.</P>
<P>HOW different, replied the <HI>Major,</HI> from such a Woman as you
are describing, is the charming <HI>Belvidera?</HI> I have seen her lovely
Features, which give new Joy to the <HI>Trium∣phant,</HI> languish, and look
comfortless, when she has heard of the <HI>Unhappy.</HI>—Her Voice,
which wakes the Soul, and calls it up into the Ear, with all the Musick of a
Trumpet, falls, and trembles, when she talks of Wretchedness, which she
is sensible she cannot remedy. The Numbers whom she obliges, have two
Rival Benefactors, which divide and perplex their Gratitude; for they know not
which most merits it, her <HI>Manner,</HI> or her <HI>Bounty.</HI>—To
such a sweet Excess of Tenderness does <HI>Belvi∣dera</HI> raise her
Charity, that she would be old, unseen, unlovely, rather than adorable, as
she now is; because she <HI>pains,</HI> where she must <HI>on∣ly
pity.</HI>—She is, at once, the most charming, and least conscious,
of all Women!</P>
<P>WHILE we were speaking of her, we were surprized in the most
agreeable Manner pos∣sible, by the Sight of her Chariot passing us. 
<PB N="284" REF="293"/>—She bowed very humbly, and order'd it to stop;
and, while her Servants retir'd, with a Politeness and Sensibility, which I
have very seldom remark'd in Persons of their low Con∣dition, she
receiv'd us with an Air of Sweetness, that resembled the Idea which we have
of a descending Angel.—She lamented, that she was in her Chariot;
because her Coach, she said, might have held us all; she wou'd,
there∣fore, <HI>leave</HI> it, to bless our Walk. The Major offer'd her his
Arm; at which I felt a kind of foolish Envy, which I knew not how to
re∣concile with my growing Passion for <HI>Patty Amble.</HI></P>
<P>HOW attractive is Beauty, when it is sof∣ten'd by the humblest
Modesty, and yet dig∣nify'd by Wit and Majesty!—She busied and
delighted my Soul; and I was so trans∣ported by her Voice and Sentiments,
that I fell in Love with my own Silence, because it pro∣long'd the Pleasure
of her Speaking.</P>
<P>WE were join'd in this Place, very unex∣pectedly, by <HI>Ned
Volatile,</HI> who had enquir'd for us at the <HI>Major</HI>'s, and rambled
hither in pursuit of us. He had never seen <HI>Belvidera,</HI> nor so
much as knew who she was, yet came up with his usual Air, of brisk
Assurance and Sufficiency.—<HI>What!</HI> cry'd he, <HI>my Old
Friends engag'd in a Confederacy against my Li∣berty!</HI> Then he retreated,
with a kind of counterfeit Astonishment, and, lowering his Voice, went on
thus, looking, with a genteel Levity, upon the Lady; <HI>I don't know,
Ma∣dam,</HI> <PB N="285" REF="294"/> <HI>what undeserv'd good Opinion you may
have, of these grave Gentlemen; but I shall never be brought to think
patiently of 'em again.—'Twas ungenerous, and unpardonable, to give a
poor Wretch no Warning; but draw him in, with an unguarded Breast, to stand
the Mark of all these Charms, where it is impossible but I must fall by
some of 'em!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Believe me, Sir,</HI> reply'd <HI>Belvidera,</HI> with a Mixture
of Disdain and Compassion; <HI>The Danger you complain of, is too small
to excuse your Terror.—However open your Heart may lie, few first
Blows reach thither.—If you are wounded at Sight, the Hurt was only in
your Eyes; and the Armour, you should have been defended by, was not a
Breast-Plate, but a Head-Piece.</HI></P>
<P>I SHALL never forget, with what an Air of Surprize and Awe, poor <HI>Ned Volatile</HI> start∣ed back, at the piercing Voice of <HI>Belvidera,</HI> and from the smiling Sharpness of her Satire: But I
love the young Rogue's Virtue; and, I own, my Heart triumph'd for him, under
the Mortification of this Retreat; for it sate on him, methought, more
gracefully, than all his natural Gayety.</P>
<P>HE kept behind us all the Way, in a sin∣cere and becoming
Confusion, listning, atten∣tively, to <HI>Belvidera,</HI> without one
Attempt to Rally: But I observ'd him, at length, draw out his Pocket-Book
with a Sigh; in which, he writ for Three or Four Minutes, and then, giving it
into my Hands, I found he had been <PB N="286" REF="295"/> penning down his <HI>Dying Speech,</HI> with a woful Warning to all Christian People, to take
Ex∣ample by his Suffering.</P>
<Q> 
<L>Let rash, young Fools for what I now endure,</L> 
<L>Learn, never to believe their Hearts secure:</L> 
<L>Once, O ye Gay! a striking Hour may come,</L> 
<L>When Mirth shall cease to smile; and Wit grow dumb!</L> 
<L>The light, low Jest! the giddy Repartee!</L> 
<L>The chearful Triflings, of the Vain and Free!</L> 
<L>When <HI>Love's</HI> warm Hand shall wake the wond'ring Heart,</L>

<L>Will shame the Mem'ry, and increase the Smart.</L> 
<L>Oh! <HI>Love!</HI>—from Midnight Mirth, Wit, Friends, and
Wine,</L> 
<L>Take my snatch'd Soul, from this soft Moment Thine.</L> </Q>
<P>I COU'D not resist the Temptation I was under, to make Atonement
for <HI>Ned</HI>'s Imper∣tinence, by presenting his Poetick Penitence to the
Divine <HI>Belvidera:</HI> She perus'd it with a conscious Blush, and an
Air of eloquent Dis∣order, which has given a reviving Hope to the
Distress of her new Lover. But it robb'd us too soon of her Company; for
she took Leave presently after, and, permitting her Hand to <HI>Ned
Volatile,</HI> stept, again, into her Chariot, and left us, melancholy, and
dissa∣tisfy'd.</P>
<P>THE Major and I, were for returning to our first Subject, and had
resum'd the Dis∣course of Charity; but <HI>Ned</HI> would have no∣thing
but Love. His whole Soul was fill'd <PB N="287" REF="296"/> with the Image of <HI>Belvidera:</HI> And a Passion, which, 'till now, he cou'd never mention
se∣riously, was become, on a sudden, the darling Theme of his
Conversation.—Groves, Brooks, and <HI>Belvidera,</HI> were the Objects
of his ena∣mour'd Fancy.—Silence, Thought, Shade, Solitude, Things which
he had never before a Notion of, presented themselves to his Ima∣gination,
as the most desirable Delights of Na∣ture.—The Major oblig'd him
beyond Ac∣knowledgment, and won all that remain'd of his Heart, by talking to
him of a Poem, which he cou'd shew him, when he came Home, call'd, <HI>The
Picture of Love</HI>; and repeating out of it some Lines, the most adapted
to <HI>Ned</HI>'s new Circumstances.</P>
<Q> 
<LG>
<L>Cautious, ye Fated! who frequent the Fair,</L>
<L>Your Breasts examine, nor too rashly <HI>dare.</HI></L>
<L>Curb your untrusted Hearts, while yet they're free:</L>
<L>Love is resistless, when you <HI>feel</HI> 'tis <HI>He.</HI></L>
</LG> 
<LG>
<L>Small is the Soul's first Wound, from Beauty's Dart,</L>
<L>And scarce th' unheeded Fever warms the Heart.</L>
<L>Long, we mistake it, under <HI>Liking</HI>'s Name:</L>
<L>A <HI>soft Indulgence!</HI> that deserves no Blame.</L>
<L>A Pleasure, we but take, to do her Right,</L>
<L>Whose Presence charms us, and whose Words delight!</L>
<L>Whose sweet Remembrance broods upon the Breast;</L>
<L>And whose dear Friendship is, with Pride, possess'd!</L>
</LG> 
<LG>
<L>Excited thus, the smother'd Fire, at length,</L>
<L>Bursts into Blaze, and burns with open Strength.</L>
<L><PB N="288" REF="297"/>This Image, which, before, but sooth'd the
Mind,</L>
<L>Now <HI>lords</HI> it there, and rages unconfin'd.</L>
<L>Mixing with all our Thoughts, it wastes the Day;</L>
<L>And when Night comes, it dreams the Soul away;</L>
<L>Pungent Impatience tingles in each Vein,</L>
<L>And the Sick Bosom throbs, with aking Pain.</L>
</LG></Q>
<P><HI>Ned</HI> was impatient to learn more, of a Lesson which he
found so fit for him. But the <HI>Major,</HI> with much Difficulty, came off,
by assuring him, that though he could remem∣ber no more at present, yet
he had it at Home in Manuscript, and would shew it him all an∣other
Time.—He then grew quiet, and walk'd on contentedly, 'till the full
Advance of the Day put us in mind, that if we return'd, we might perhaps, find
Dinner waiting for us.</P>

<P>WHEN Souls of a superior Form, look <HI>Abroad,</HI> and discover
among their honest Inferiors, Minds capable of the finest Impressions,
and only in Danger of being ren∣der'd <PB N="289" REF="298"/> barren by Poverty,
Ignorance, and In∣juries; they take a Godlike Pleasure in com∣municating
their own Virtues: they strive, with the most Praise-worthy Charity, to
sub∣stitute the more influencing Power of their own good Example in the
Room of evil Patterns by others, 'till, by turning Injuries into Bene∣fits,
they raise their obscure Neighbours, to bright Images of themselves.</P>
<P>ALL Persons, who are Favourites of For∣tune, who shine in exalted
Stations, who are gifted with large Possessions, and surrounded with
a Multiplicity of Dependents, have the Blessing, I have been speaking of,
in their Power. They may choose for their Dome∣sticks, the Distress'd
of both Sexes, whom Poverty has render'd humble enough to wish to become <HI>Servants</HI>; and whose Discretion, adapting their Nature to their
Condition, has taught them the Spirit of Obedience, and Di∣ligence.</P>
<P>A GOOD Master may be consider'd as the Soul of his Family, who
communicates Acti∣on and Dignity to all, who are under his In∣fluence, and
animates them by his own Exam∣ple, to be, in some measure, like himself;
his House will be the Habitation of Wisdom, Vir∣tue and Honour. If such a
Master be at Home, and a Stranger wants Access to him, that Stranger will
be prejudiced in his Favour, even before he beholds him; for it is easy, and
natural, to read in the Voices, Looks and Ges∣tures of the People <HI>below
Stairs,</HI> what sort of <PB N="290" REF="299"/> a Person one may expect to
meet with <HI>above,</HI> Nay, suppose him even <HI>Absent,</HI> he
remains in some measure at <HI>Home,</HI> leaving so much of the Force of
his Presence, in those, who represent him: He reigns in the obliging
Deportment of his Domesticks; and their grateful Manner of receiving all
Persons who inquire after him, proclaims the Goodness of their Master.
All the Honour, or, Dishonour, of a Family, re∣verts to the Source, and
either clears or pol∣lutes the Fountain.</P>
<P>THERE are too many <HI>haughty Flutterers,</HI> in the World, made
giddily vain and unthink∣ing by too much Prosperity, who <HI>dream,</HI> that
People of low Condition, ought to be over∣look'd; and that <HI>Servants,</HI>
because <HI>Servants,</HI> should not be treated as of the same Species
with themselves. These Gentlemen, as they must be call'd, have
Understandings abundant∣ly too coarse to be come at by Railery: They ought
to be bluntly told, That <HI>good Servants</HI> might make <HI>good
Masters,</HI> and that theirs pos∣sess good Qualities of which
themselves appear to be destitute. They ought in very plain Terms, to be
informed, That <HI>Reason</HI> has plac'd their Servants above them, tho'
themselves are pleased, unreasonably, to despise them, because
Fortune, without Demerit of theirs, had placed them <HI>seemingly</HI>
lower.</P>
<P>A LOW and obscure Birth has been often the Lot of a high, and noble
Spirit. It seems to be the Victory of <HI>Nature</HI> over <HI>Fortune,</HI>
that she can produce such valuable Creatures, in <PB N="291" REF="300"/> the
most abject <HI>State</HI> of Servitude: A <HI>Plain-Dealing,</HI> faithful
Servant is a Jewel of inesti∣mable Value.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Compassion</HI> due to honest Men, on ac∣count of their
Poverty, must, after having ap∣proved their Integrity, be refin'd into <HI>Regard,</HI> and <HI>Esteem.</HI> I have, for this Reason,
con∣sider'd it as a well-spirited Piece of Advice in Monsieur <HI>Bruyere,</HI> who writes like an <HI>accom∣plish'd Gentleman,</HI> when
he counsels all, <HI>of that</HI> Rank, <HI>to treat</HI> a Good Old
Domestick, <HI>rather like a</HI> Friend <HI>than a</HI> Servant. And truly,
it is far from impossible, but that a Master may stand in need of
such a Servant for his Friend, and find him, upon Trial, a much better, than
those inconstant Comrades, whom the World, in their mistaken Phrase,
would be apt to call <HI>his Betters.</HI></P>
<P>I LATELY had a Story told me to this Pur∣pose, and if it affects the
Reader, as it did me, he will not be displeased, that I give it him by way
of Example.</P>
<P>A GENTLEMAN named <HI>Belmont</HI>; a Per∣son of Distinction,
filled an honourable Post in the Army, and behaved himself well during the
late Wars in <HI>Flanders.</HI> He is Honest, Brave, Hearty, Sincere,
Generous, and Affa∣ble; was generally courted for his Company by his Brother
Officers, and universally be∣loved by his Soldiers. In those Sunshine
Days of his Prosperity, <HI>Belmont</HI> held dear, as his Bosom-Intimate,
a Gentleman, by Name, <HI>Cel∣sus</HI>; and had one particular Servant, whom,
<PB N="292" REF="301"/> on account of many rare Qualities, he loved above the
rest, and treated as Monsieur <HI>Bruyere</HI> advises, and whom, for the
Sake of his Fide∣lity to his Master, we will call <HI>Fido.</HI></P>
<P><HI>BELMONT,</HI> and <HI>Celsus</HI> lived, indeed, like true
Friends: And, as if each thought the other's Interest his own, they
commutually, as Exigences on either Side required, furnished one another with
Money, and desired no In∣terest or Security. At length, when they had long
loved and lived together, <HI>Celsus,</HI> was called to another Quarter:
Never did Soul and Body part with more Reluctancy than these Friends, being <HI>less</HI> certain when, and where, and how, they should meet again.
Much about the same Time, <HI>Fido,</HI> having been bred to a Trade, and got
a little Stock by his Master, had Thoughts of setting up in the World. His
Master, when he discharged him, added to the Salary he paid him, a
handsome Present, and wished him good Fortune, with such Familiarity
and Condescension, as made the <HI>Wish</HI> more endearing than the <HI>Present.</HI></P>
<P>AFTER this, if we behold <HI>Belmont,</HI> it must be under a Cloud
of Evils: He met with cross and severe Accidents which reduced him to
narrower Circumstances, than suited so liberal a Soul: He, who delighted
in extricating others out of Troubles and Perplexities, was, at length,
involv'd in Difficulties himself. In a word, his Affairs were brought to that
Ex∣tremity, that a certain Sum must be punctually paid on such a Day, or <HI>Belmont</HI> be exposed to <PB N="293" REF="302"/> such an indecent
Distress, as it is painful but to think of.</P>
<P>MANY Measures he had try'd, in vain, to make Provision against
it: He was acquaint∣ed with many Persons of Fashion, who had been lavish
of their Vows of Friendship, and profuse, even to Prodigality, in offering
him their Services, at Times, when they well knew there was no Danger in the
Offer. He tried them all in their Turns: And found them, all, false
alike.</P>
<P>HOW will it go with poor <HI>Belmont,</HI> who has the Ill-luck of
such Acquaintance? why, the Reader will be pleased to hear, That <HI>Cel∣sus</HI> is return'd to <HI>England,</HI> as much in the Abundance,
as <HI>Belmont</HI> in the Want of all Things, and settled within a Mile or
two of <HI>London.</HI> On him were <HI>Belmont</HI>'s Eyes turn'd from the
sad Scene that threaten'd him: Here he is sure to be right; Here his
Address must prevail: I fancy myself walking over the Fields with <HI>Belmont</HI>; I hear him say, he is no longer to groan under his
Misfortunes, than till they can reach the Ear of <HI>Celsus</HI>; They want
no∣thing towards being reliev'd, but being bare∣ly laid before him: Then <HI>Belmont</HI> is to asto∣nish him with the Falshood and Meanness of
his other Acquaintance. Thus soothing his Imagination, he arrives at the
House of <HI>Celsus,</HI> is receiv'd with the Warmth of Friendship; he
opens his Complaint, and tells the Story of the Usage he had met with. Here
the Reader will be stunn'd—the Story was as unprofita∣ble 
<PB N="294" REF="303"/> in the Ear of <HI>Celsus,</HI> as if their
Friendship, had been a Fable.</P>
<P>AS <HI>Belmont</HI> was returning home cross the Fields, loaded with
heavy Reflections, with whom should he meet, but his old Man <HI>Fido!</HI>
walking out with an Intention to lie that Night at his Country-Lodgings, for
the Benefit of the Air. <HI>Fido</HI> would walk back, part of the Way with his
Master: And finding him very melancholy, implored him to tell the Cause of
it.—At length <HI>Belmont,</HI> half smiling, said, Thou can'st not
help me in it, honest <HI>Fido</HI>; and yet, with a Sigh, said he, now I
think on't, I will tell thee, for thou knowest <HI>Celsus.</HI>—Thou
must remember him.—Sir, reply'd <HI>Fido,</HI> and ever
shall.—I can't forget your best Friend: I hope he is not
dead!—<HI>Belmont</HI> told him the whole Story: Just as he had
finish'd it; they reach a little publick House on the
Road—<HI>Fido,</HI> without answering, begg'd him to walk in, called
for Pen, Ink, and Paper, and wrote a Note for the Money, and giving it his
Ma∣ster, said thus; <HI>I am glad at my Heart it was a Sum within my Power,
without breaking in upon my Stock, because I should have parted with it
All; for, Sir, I owe it All to you.</HI></P>
<P>LET us consider <HI>Celsus</HI> and <HI>Fido, Celsus</HI> a
Friend and a Companion; <HI>Fido</HI> a Menial Ser∣vant: <HI>Fido</HI> a Weaver
of fine Silks, <HI>Celsus</HI> a Wearer of finer; how then shall we
reconcile this Matter, That <HI>Celsus,</HI> after all this Diffe∣rence in
Substance and Figure, should be on∣ly Gentleman in <HI>Appearance,
Fido</HI> in <HI>Reality?</HI> <PB N="295" REF="304"/> It is easy to answer,
that the Stage of Life is like the Theatre, where the principal Parts acted,
are not always the best: It is not <HI>what</HI> Part we act, but <HI>how</HI> we act it, that gives us Applause. I have frequently known a
Ser∣vant the chief Ornament of a Play: It is the same in the World; where
they often make considerable Figures.</P>

<P>I AM never more delighted, than when I meet with an Opportunity to
unveil ob∣scure Merit, and produce it into Notice: There being nothing that
more easily deceives us, than our Judgment on the Wit and Learn∣ing of a
Cotemporary Writer, when we take not our Measure from our own Examination,
but rely on the Authority of Publick Rumour.</P>
<P>A PLEASANT Vein, a busy, medling Ta∣lent, Acquaintance, Importunity,
Preferment, or any outward and accidental Advantage, shall throw forward an
assuming Trifler into Distinction and Popularity: While a great, 
<PB N="296" REF="305"/> and modest Genius is neglected and unfam'd; because
not One in Fifty, of our Men of Fa∣shion, or of Quality, as they call
themselves, has an Understanding that is able to <HI>go alone.</HI> They
are forc'd, therefore, to wait 'till they have their Sustainer's Opinion to
lean against, before they dare venture upon the Praise, even of what they
are inclinable to think favoura∣bly of, as far as poor, weak <HI>Wards,</HI>
can pre∣sume <HI>to think at all,</HI> whose Wits are out in
Guardianship, and under other Mens Disposal.</P>
<P>IT is owing to the Multiplicity of these overgrown <HI>Infants,</HI>
that our Eyes and Ears are fatigu'd by such Impertinence of mistaken <HI>Encomium.</HI> Insomuch, that, to those who in∣spect the Things and
Persons which are most praised among us, we appear a Nation of <HI>Grotesque Thinkers,</HI> whose Idea of our Writers Excellence, like the <HI>Dutchmens</HI> Taste of <HI>Paint∣ing,</HI> seems to be Nature, in a
Fit of Distor∣tion, where <HI>Grimace</HI> is placed for <HI>Dignity.</HI></P>
<P>BY a Custom, that has prevailed too much, since the chearful Times
of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, when they ran into the contrary <HI>Ex∣treme</HI> to that which they had <HI>suffer'd by,</HI> and confounded
the <HI>Serious</HI> with the <HI>Humorous,</HI> treating the most solemn
Subjects after a light and wanton Manner, we have established a false
Taste of Wit, which has insensibly, like an unnoted Current, declin'd us
from our right Course, and brought us so far out of our Way, that it will
be some Time before we find our∣selves restored to our old
Relish.—The slen∣der <PB N="297" REF="306"/> Shape of the Modern
Muse, is made for becoming the <HI>Hoop-Petticoat</HI>; but there was a
charming, majestick <HI>Nakedness</HI> in that ner∣vous Simplicity, and
plain Soundness of <HI>pa∣thetick Nature,</HI> which went to the <HI>Hearts</HI> of our Forefathers, without stopping at their <HI>Fan∣cy,</HI> or winding itself into their Understanding, through a Maze
of mystical Prettinesses.</P>
<P>BUT, though this venerable, <HI>undress'd Na∣ture,</HI> is seldom
to be met with now; and has, indeed, been lost among us, for above a <HI>Cen∣tury,</HI> it was so frequent Two or Three hun∣dred Years ago, that
their lowest Class of Poets, the Composers of our good Old Ballads, have
left us some of the noblest Examples of the <HI>Sub∣lime,</HI> in its
most striking Energy. But, in the present Practice, it is stifled, as
the <HI>Roman</HI> Maid was, under the Oppression of Golden Ear∣rings,
Bracelets, Jewels, and heap'd Heavi∣nesses of the <HI>Gothick Armory.</HI>
Yet, now and then, we start upon it in the Writings of our Modern Poets; as I
did, the other Day, in an <HI>Ode, on the Power of Musick,</HI> which was
writ∣ten by a young <HI>Scots</HI> Gentleman, who has conveyed, in a naked
Grandeur, and in the ut∣most Degree of Plainness, the following awe∣ful
Thought, which carries a Terror, that will shake the Soul of every attentive
Reader.</P>
<Q> 
<L>When Living Men shall die, and Dead Men live,</L> 
<L>And <HI>Order</HI> is, again, to <HI>Chaos</HI> hurl'd;</L> 
<L>Thou, <HI>Melody!</HI> shalt still survive,</L> 
<L>And triumph o'er the <HI>Ruins</HI> of the <HI>World!</HI></L> 
<L><PB N="298" REF="307"/>A dreadful Trumpet, never heard before,</L> 
<L>By <HI>Angels</HI> never blown, 'till then,</L> 
<L>Through all the <HI>Regions</HI> of the <HI>Air</HI> shall
roar,</L> 
<L><HI>That</HI> Time <HI>is now no more!</HI></L> </Q>
<P>BUT the Accident, which has drawn me in∣to this Lamentation for the
Loss of <HI>Nature,</HI> in our Works of Wit and Poetry, where she ought
most to shew herself, is, my having taken up, in a late Perambulation, as
I stood upon the Top of <HI>Primrose-Hill,</HI> a torn Leaf of one of
those Half-penny Miscellanies, which are published for the Use and
Pleasure of our <HI>Nymphs of low Degree,</HI> and known by the Name of <HI>Garlands</HI>—That Part of it, which first caught my Eye, had its
Turn a little too <HI>Modern,</HI> as well in the Matter, as the Poetry, and
celebrated the Midnight Triumphs of some <HI>straggling Female,</HI> of
whom I had no Knowledge; but one, it should seem, of more Beauty than
Delicacy; 
<Q> 
<L>Who took the Place of Ladies bright,</L> 
<L>And with their Lords lay all the Night!</L> 
<L>Who pleas'd them with her Humour free;</L> 
<L>Oh! the charming <HI>Sally Sal'sbu—ree!</HI></L> </Q></P>
<P>BUT I pass'd lightly over this Lyrick Frag∣ment, as too ludicrous
for a Person of my Gra∣vity, and fell, unexpectedly, upon a <HI>Work,</HI>
for so I make no Scruple to call it, that deserves to live for Ever! And
which (notwithstanding its Disguise of coarse, brown Paper, almost 
<PB N="299" REF="308"/> unintelligible Corruptions of <HI>Sense,</HI> from the
Blunders of the Press, with here and there an obsolete, low Phrase, which
I have alter'd for the clearer Explanation of the Author's Mean∣ing) is so
powerfully filled, throughout, with that Blood-curdling, chilling Influence, of
Na∣ture, working on our Passions (which Criticks call the <HI>Sublime</HI>)
that I never met it stronger in <HI>Homer</HI> himself; nor even in that
prodigious <HI>English</HI> Genius, who has made the <HI>Greek</HI> our

</LG></Q></P>
<P>I AM sorry I am not able to acquaint my Reader with <HI>his</HI>
Name, to whom we owe this melancholy Piece, of <HI>finish'd Poetry,</HI>
under the humble Title of a <HI>Ballad.</HI>—<HI>Such Ballads</HI> were
the reverend Fragments of disjointed <HI>Homer,</HI> when they were sung
about the Streets of the <HI>Grecian</HI> Cities, before <HI>Lycurgus</HI>
caused the Limbs to be assembled into Union; and so piec'd, redeem'd,
and consecrated them to the End of Time, as we now see 'em in his <HI>Iliad.</HI>—Yet, the Common Fate of Merit is so unequal to its
Claim, that one might almost venture to conclude, That this <HI>great
Genius,</HI> whoever he was, lived poor, and died unknown; in Want perhaps, of
Ease and Comfort, while he had Excellence, that merited a Nation's Gratitude,
for the Honour he might have lived to do it.</P>
<P>FROM an Air of impressive Earnestness, that is
distinguishable through this Piece, I am of Opinion, that it was founded on
the real <PB N="303" REF="312"/> History of some unhappy Woman of the Age
the Author liv'd in, who had the Misfortune to die untimely by her Lover's
Insensibility; or, rather, by his Ingratitude.—I please my∣self
with an Imagination, that this <HI>Sonnet</HI> might be one of <HI>Shakespear</HI>'s. A hundred worse are imputed to him: And there is his
peculiar, solemn Power to touch this <HI>Church-Yard Ter∣ror,</HI> very
visible in the <HI>Ghost</HI> of this Ballad.</P>
<P>BUT, whoever the Author was, his Judg∣ment appears to have been as
extraordinary as his Genius; as is finely visible in his Conduct of this
little Poem.—When the Ghost has gli∣ded in, and stands at the Bed's
Foot of the sleep∣ing Lover, had the Speech begun immediate∣ly, the Reader
must have been hurried too fast away from the Impression which the
Ap∣parition was design'd to make on him: He is, therefore judiciously
detained in this Place by a Description of her Face and Posture, so
strongly painted, that we really seem to <HI>see</HI> her. And, after a
short Moral Reflection, which follows aptly in the Third Stanza, we are
acquainted, during this artful Interval, with her Character, her Youth, her
Beauty, and the Cause of her unhappy Death: And, by that Time we are prepared
to know her, and to pity her, the Speech is open'd with this sharp and
startling Summons. 
<Q> 
<L>Awake! she cry'd,—Thy true Love calls,</L> 
<L>Come from her Midnight Grave!</L> </Q></P>
<P><PB N="304" REF="313"/>BUT nothing was ever juster, or more
strikingly imagin'd, than his Comparison of the Ghost's Face, to an <HI>April</HI> Sky, (which is, at best, but faintly shining, and is here
made fainter still, by a scattering Cloud that dims it) to the Shadow, as
it were, or thin Resemblance of a Light not visible. This is an Image, so
true to the Meaning, so Poetical, and well-adapted, that it greatly
deserves Notice: As does also, That Clay-cold, Lilly-Hand, that holds up a <HI>sable Shroud</HI>! The Opposition of the Shroud's Blackness, to the
Lilly White∣ness of the Hand, is a delicate and graceful Stroke, and very
judiciously heighten'd by that Epithet of <HI>Clay-cold,</HI> which makes us
shrink, as if we <HI>felt,</HI> what we <HI>see,</HI> so very <HI>strongly.</HI></P>
<P>TO wake us from this Horror, in order to make way for that <HI>Pity,</HI> which he is prepar∣ing to move in us, we are, by a sudden, yet
almost imperceptible, Transition, carried away from what she <HI>is,</HI>
to what she <HI>was,</HI> before Love chang'd her; 
<Q> 
<L>Her <HI>Bloom</HI> was like the <HI>Morning Flow'r,</HI></L> 
<L>That <HI>sips</HI> the <HI>Silver-Dew.</HI></L> </Q></P>
<P>I AM charm'd by a Stroke in this sweet <HI>Simile,</HI> which is
touch'd with so much Delica∣cy, that it would go near to escape the
Obser∣vation of any Reader, not skill'd in Poetry: I will therefore take
Notice, That her exact Time of Life being directly pointed out by 
<PB N="305" REF="314"/> <HI>The Morning Rose, just opening to the View,</HI>
that Expression of <HI>Sipping the Silver-Dew,</HI> is peculiarly just
and elegant: For, where a Flower is full blown, the Dew-drops have free
Admission, and are taken in, as it were, by large Draughts; but a budding
Flower, receiving no Moisture, but on its Edges, is, with the finest
Propriety, said to <HI>sip</HI> it.</P>
<P>A SECOND excellent <HI>Simile</HI> is, That where he compares a
secret Love in a Woman's Heart, to the Canker-worm in a Bud, that fades and
destroys it: And this, again, has the Air of <HI>Shakespear,</HI> who has
the same Al∣lusion for <HI>Grief</HI> in one of his Tragedies.—There
is something exquisitely <HI>touching</HI> in that noble Tenderness of
her Reproach, in the <HI>Eighth Stanza.</HI>—That <HI>Erotema,</HI> or
Figure of <HI>Questioning,</HI> which takes up the <HI>Ninth, Tenth,</HI> and <HI>Eleventh,</HI> is pursued with the most pathetick Emphasis; and, at
last, broken off with an <HI>Aposiopesis,</HI> so natural, and so
mov∣ing, that I have seldom seen a Beauty more distinguishable. It is
where, after all those passionate <HI>Why's,</HI> with which she has
been up∣braiding her Lover's Falshood, she interrupts them, on a sudden,
with this Self-accusing Question, which strikes out the <HI>Moral</HI>
too, in a surprizing Flash of Warning, where it was least to be expected;

<Q> 
<L>And <HI>why, alas!</HI> did I, fond Maid!</L> 
<L><HI>Believe</HI> the flatt'ring Tale?</L> </Q></P>
<P><PB N="306" REF="315"/>BUT it were endless to particularize the
Beauties of this charming Ballad. The whole may be said to be one continued
Beauty! And, I believe, it will not be possible for any serious Reader to
peruse, or hear it, without Emotions in his Blood, that will speak more in
its due Praise, than the most regular <HI>Cri∣tique</HI> on it.</P>
<P>IT is a plain and noble Masterpiece of the <HI>natural</HI> Way of
Writing, without Turns, Points, Conceits, Flights, Raptures, or Af∣fectation of
what Kind soever. It shakes the Heart by the mere Effect of its own
Strength and Passionateness; unassisted by those flam∣ing
Ornaments, which as often <HI>dazle,</HI> as <HI>dis∣play,</HI> in Poetry.
This was owing to the Author's Native Force of Genius; For they, who conceive a
Thought distinctly, will, of Necessity, express it plainly, because,
out of the Words which arise, and offer themselves to embody a Meaning,
they find no Use for the Superfluous, but to darken, and confound their
Purpose.</P>

<P><PB N="308" REF="317"/>I KNOW not how it comes to pass; but an
Enormity, of like Nature, has had Con∣fidence enough of late Years, to creep
into His Majesty's <HI>Navy</HI>; to the most manifest Hazard of bringing

Hard∣ship, for Example, must it be, for a Crew, who can fight like <HI>Lions,</HI> to be sent to Sea in the <HI>Antelope?</HI> Or, for a

I wou'd instruct him in the Mystery of making out, into <HI>Crackers:</HI>
And I busied my self, for half an Hour, with becoming Gravity, and

Whose Powder being apply'd to the important Use which he had bought it for,

<DATE><HI>July</HI> 14. 1724.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>Mr. <HI>PLAIN DEALER,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I BELONG to a Club of Friendly Citi∣zens: And we meet, every <HI>Monday</HI> Night, to discourse of such Things as may entertain, and
improve us, in a way most suitable to that industrious, and unambiti∣ous,
Honesty, which Men of Trade pro∣pose to thrive by. But our Diversion has
been often spoil'd by a great Scholar, who is got among us, that makes no
more of <HI>Greek,</HI> and <HI>Latin,</HI> than if it were only plain <HI>English!</HI>—Ever since he was introduc'd, he has had all the
Talk to himself; but <PB N="312" REF="321"/> was never understood, above
Three times from the first Night he came into our Com∣pany. He is <HI>Great
Mogul</HI> of our Club, and reigns Absolute, and without a Mini∣stry:
Publishing his <HI>Edicts</HI> in a Language peculiar to the Throne, and
which, being unintelligible, by any of his <HI>Vassals,</HI> can neither be
contradicted, nor disputed against.</P>
<P>HE expatiated, last Night, with a Stile, unusually <HI>florid,</HI> on the <HI>Verbosity, Loquaciousness,</HI> and <HI>Propension to Garrulity,</HI> of a worthy Common-Council-Man, whom we
were commending, for a ready Speaker. And when one of us, by way of Atone∣ment,
mentioned my Neighbour <HI>Hushly,</HI> the Cheesemonger, as the <HI>silentest</HI> Man, in <HI>London</HI>; he answer'd, <HI>That</HI>
Taciturnity <HI>was a Quality as</HI> ineligible <HI>as Excess of</HI>
Narra∣tion; <HI>for it</HI> dehominated <HI>those Persons who were</HI>
obnubilated <HI>by its</HI> Umbrageousness; <HI>and</HI> involv'd <HI>their</HI> Comprehension <HI>in a</HI> La∣byrinth <HI>of</HI>
Internality.</P>
<P>IT happen'd, fortunately for the CLUB, that an honest Drunken
Officer, belonging to the <HI>East-India</HI> Company, was among us upon this
Occasion.—He was, now, what we call <HI>Half Seas over</HI>; and
star'd at our Man of Oratory, for, a Minute with∣out Motion! At last, he
began to tell him, with the most compos'd Face in the World, That he was
charm'd with this Opportu∣nity of discoursing with a Gentleman of 
<PB N="313" REF="322"/> so much <HI>Wit</HI> and <HI>Learning,</HI> and hop'd
he shou'd have his Decision in a Point, that was pretty nice, and concern'd
some <HI>Eastern</HI> Manufactures, of <HI>Antient</HI> and <HI>reverend
Ety∣mology.</HI> Modern Criticks, he said, were undetermin'd about them; but
for <HI>His</HI> Part, he had always maintain'd, That <HI>Chintz, Bullbull,
Morees,</HI> and <HI>Ponabaguzzys,</HI> were of nobler and more generous Use,
than <HI>Doorguzees,</HI> or <HI>Nourfurmannys</HI>; not but he held against <HI>Byrampauts,</HI> in Favour of <HI>Ni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣canees</HI> and <HI>Boralchauders</HI>; Only, he wish'd, That
so accurate a Judge wou'd instruct him, why <HI>Tapzils,</HI> and <HI>Sallampores</HI> have given Place to <HI>Neganepauts?</HI> And why <HI>Bejatapoutz</HI> shou'd be more esteem'd, than the finer Fabrick of <HI>Blue Chelloes?</HI></P>
<P>THERE was not One, of all the Com∣pany, except the grave Banterer
himself, but laugh'd out aloud, at this humorous Retribution of the Scholar's
affected Lan∣guage. He look'd a little out of Counte∣nance, and sate silent
for some Time. But he started up, at last, with a smiling Air of good
Humour: And, filling out a Brim∣mer, drank the Health of the <HI>East-India</HI> Officer; and, then, spoke to him, as
fol∣lows.—<HI>Sir, I find myself much obliged, and return you my
Publick Thanks. You have held to me so true a Glass, that I see, and am
ashamed of the Image of my Vanity. I was weak enough to be growing angry;
but, upon a short Recollection, find you have</HI> <PB N="314" REF="323"/> <HI>used me no otherwise, than I have treated the</HI> CLUB, <HI>and been
forgiven for it, these Six Months. In short, Sir, you have re∣deem'd me,
from an Affectation, that made me ridiculous; and, as long as I live, I will
take Care to be Wiser.</HI></P>
<P>THUS all ended well; and the CLUB being restor'd to Freedom, I am
deputed, in their Name, to write this Account of it, to the PLAIN DEALER; that
it may be publish'd for the common Benefit. Your Health is just going
round, and,</P>

<P>FOR my Reader's Entertainment, I shall add, to these Two Letters,
Two uncommon Pieces of Poetry. The First was written, by <HI>Karasin,</HI>
the Favourite Mistress of <HI>Tamerlane the Great</HI>; by way of
Congratulation, after his Success against <HI>Bajazet.</HI> It was compos'd
in Form of a <HI>Lozange</HI>; the Letters of which were Brilliant Diamonds,
upon a Ground of Crimson Velvet. The Words, the Order, and the Figure, are
exactly as in the Origi∣nal. Note, The <HI>Wit</HI> of the Lady's Poetry, lay
in its <HI>Shape,</HI> and <HI>fine Cloaths:</HI> Where a Lady's Wit often
lies, in other Countries, besides <HI>Tartary.</HI></P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub"><DATE>FRIDAY, <HI>July</HI> 31. 1724.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>THERE is a Hobby-Horse, in the World, call'd Nobility by Right of <HI>Birth</HI>; which was the Invention of industri∣ous Policy, to entail,
and perpetuate, Vir∣tue. But, like Vinegar, from the finest Wines, it is so
changed, by its Putrefaction, That there is not a sharper Curse, among the
Scourges of God's Vengeance, than is inflicted on Mankind, by that silly
Thing, called, <PB N="318" REF="327"/> <HI>Pride of Descent.</HI> It was
first indulged, as a Mark of Merit: But it clings, inseparably, to the <HI>Line,</HI> after the most manifest Extincti∣on of all the <HI>Worth,</HI> which it was given for.</P>
<P>YET, there was both the <HI>Rational,</HI> and the <HI>Generous,</HI>
in that Hope, which seems to have been conceiv'd, by the first Inventors of <HI>Nobility,</HI> from its Original Institution.—Some Great, and
Powerful Prince, when he had experienc'd a Servant's Courage, his Con∣duct, or
Integrity; and, was willing to tran∣smit those Virtues (after they had been
so useful to Himself) to the future Benefit of His Heirs and
Successors; made it his first Care to bestow, on this able Favourite,
such Lands, and Extent of Revenue, as might place him above the Necessity
of concerning himself for his Childrens Support in Life. And this left him at
perfect Leisure, to en∣large, and inspire, their Minds, till He made them
capable of succeeding, as well to his Toils, and Dangers, as to his Honours,
and Possessions.</P>
<P>TO strengthen, yet more, their Expecta∣tion of so good an End,
They contriv'd this further Means of adding visible, and out∣ward Marks;
betokening Honour, Power, and Wisdom: Such as <HI>Titles, Robes, Rank,
Privileges,</HI> and a Train of Pomps, and Cere∣monies. All These they made <HI>Hereditary,</HI> for this weighty, and sufficient
Reason:—Because, It was a natural Hope, that Persons, who were
exempt from private Wants, should, <PB N="319" REF="328"/> also, be
unsubject to private <HI>Baseness.</HI> They would, then, be at Liberty
to enlarge, and exalt, their Thoughts, in Proportion to that High Condition,
which they grew up in the Expectation, and Fore-knowledge of: 'Till they came
to disdain narrow Principles, and renounce selfish Purposes; such as <HI>Poverty</HI> might have seemed to justify; but, which could never
correspond with that Magnificence and disinterested Scope of Mind, which
was propos'd to be the Consequence of so distin∣guish'd an Education,
in a Life so happily provided for.</P>
<P>A NOBLEMAN, the Descendant of No∣ble Ancestors, when we consider
him in this Light, seems to be One of the Pillars of Hu∣man Virtue, and the
honour'd Ornament of a Body Politick! And the only Reason, why we talk with
Respect, or even with Gravity, of the <HI>Antiquity</HI> of a Man's Family,
is, Be∣cause, by how many more Successions the Line has continu'd <HI>Noble,</HI> by so many more Examples their Virtues are suppos'd to have
been fortified; 'till the Practice, and Love of <HI>Glory, Justice,
Knowledge,</HI> and <HI>Compassion,</HI> are esteem'd inherent, in their
very Nature; and their Blood flows down, distinguish'd, by a kind of <HI>Inspiration,</HI> which it carries with it.</P>
<P>BUT, exclusive of this single Consideration what a ridiculous
Pretence to <HI>Reverence</HI> is the Accident of having been <HI>born, to live
lazily!</HI>—It is Insolence; in the highest Degree, for 
<PB N="320" REF="329"/> a <HI>Cypher,</HI> of Rank, and Title, to expect
Sub∣mission, from a Person, who is venerable, for his good Qualities,
upon no better a Foun∣dation, than because the <HI>accomplish'd
Commo∣ner</HI> is, perhaps, the Son of an honest Man, who had nothing to
depend on, but his In∣dustry; And the <HI>foolish Lord</HI> had a Father,
who left him an Estate, and a Title, which somebody <HI>(a long Time
ago!)</HI> gave a sturdy, valiant, <HI>Soldier,</HI> to maintain his
Posterity, till they shou'd grow <HI>good for nothing,</HI> and look with
Scorn, at their first Founder: Draw∣ing all their empty Glory from the
number'd Ages, which have passed, since <HI>Merit,</HI> and <HI>Humility,</HI> could claim a Place, in their <HI>Great Family!</HI></P>
<P>IF, in the World, there is a pleasanter Piece of stupid
Impertinence, than ordinary, It is, that conceited and satisfied, <HI>Self-Preference,</HI> with which one of these <HI>Happy</HI> Creatures
looks down, from his own Sublimity, upon the <HI>Merit</HI> that lies below
him!—But I wonder what he would Answer, if, in the Heighth of his
Exultation, <HI>Fortune</HI> shou'd take a Freak to whisper this
Question, in his Ear, 
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>Pray, my Lord! have you consider'd, how to</HI>
Deserve <HI>this fine Distinction, which you in∣herit, without knowing
why?—Are you Honester, than your own Steward?</HI> Pretty much upon a <HI>Par.—Are you Braver, than your ragged Cousin?</HI> Oh! no—Not
at all.—<HI>Are you more Pious, than your Chaplain?</HI> Far from it, I
assure you.—<PB N="321" REF="330"/> <HI>Are you Wiser, or more
Learned, than my Lady, your Lordship's Wife?</HI> But a little, if any
thing.—<HI>Are you Richer, than your Banker?</HI> Not so Rich, by half
a Plumb.—<HI>Pray, what then may your Lordship's Pretensions be, to
that Respect, which you claim from others?</HI>—Why,—you know, <HI>says he,</HI> that I was <HI>born to it.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>IT is a pleasant Pretension! let us trace it a little
higher.—Why is <HI>This Lord</HI>'s Family of more Dignity than <HI>That
Lord</HI>'s, since their Estates, and Rank, are Equal? <HI>Oh! there is a
very good Reason for That: It is, because His Race is most
Ancient.</HI>—Pray, what do you mean by <HI>Ancient?</HI> Was not <HI>Adam</HI> their common Father? <HI>Yes: But This My-Lord has been longer in
Possession of Lands, than That My-Lord has.</HI>—So then, the
Case, it seems, stands thus, <HI>Other Mens Acquirements must give
Him</HI> DIGNITY, <HI>to whom Other Mens Merit has given</HI> DISTINCTION!</P>
<P>ANTIQUITY of Name, and Family, is one of the most riduculous Things
in Nature, when it is made use of, as the <HI>Ground of Ho∣nours:</HI> There
being nothing more certain, than that the Revolutions of Time and For∣tune,
have us'd all Families alike. And, were it possible to see, backward,
into the Obscurity of past Ages, we might pick out <HI>Beggars,</HI> from
our proudest Lines; and point at <HI>Princes,</HI> in our humblest. This
Nobility, that consists in <HI>Sound,</HI> is an empty, and chi∣merical, 
<PB N="322" REF="331"/> Grandeur: It is a mere <HI>King of Clubs,</HI> who, as
the Game happens to be, may run away from the <HI>Knave,</HI> and see the
single <HI>Ace</HI> a nobler <HI>Card</HI> than <HI>His Majesty!</HI></P>
<P>I FANCY, that, if I were a <HI>Lord,</HI> the <HI>Tur∣key</HI>-Cock,
with his sweeping Wing, erected Neck, and Peer-like Strut, within the Sphere
of his <HI>Barn-door Royalty,</HI> wou'd make me sick of my boasted <HI>Quality,</HI> unless I had better Claim than my <HI>Pride,</HI> to the
Stateliness I was distinguish'd by.</P>
<P>THE true Use of <HI>Titles,</HI> is, That they may serve, as
shining Lights, to lay open and il∣lustrate, the spacious Chambers of a <HI>Mind well-furnished.</HI> But, to a close, and sordid, Soul, they are
like Torches, which we carry down, to illuminate a sickly Dungeon: Where they
expose, but the more disgrace∣fully, the narrow Cells, bare Walls; and
Dirtiness.</P>
<P>THE basest Thing in Nature is, To have <HI>Power</HI> to do <HI>much</HI> Good, without <HI>Will</HI> to do <HI>any.</HI> How contemptible,
then, are they, who, becoming insolent by Prosperity, think on nothing so
seldom as the Distresses of the Miserable? And, while they were made
No∣ble, for this End only, to be active in good Offices, live, for <HI>Pleasure,</HI> and to no better Purpose than one of their <HI>Hounds,</HI> or their <HI>setting Dogs</HI>?—If a Nobleman, who is
thus declin'd, from the only End of his Institution, can be Author of any
Good, by Effect of his <HI>Example,</HI> it must be such an 
<PB N="323" REF="332"/> accidental, and involuntary, Service, as was done, of
old, to the <HI>Philosopher.</HI>—He was ask'd, From whom he learnt, to
be so steady, in Pursuits of Virtue? 
<Q REND="inline">'I learn it, <HI>said he,</HI> from the Persons
who live <HI>most vici∣ously</HI>: For, observing what makes them
de∣spicable, I see plainly what to <HI>shun</HI>: And I guess, by the <HI>Reverse,</HI> what it is that I ought to <HI>practise.</HI></Q></P>
<P>The Eastern People ascribe to <HI>Plato</HI> several excellent
Sayings, which we do not find in his Works: And, among others, they cite this
following. 
<Q REND="inline">'<HI>Plenty</HI> and <HI>Want,</HI> are Two <HI>Clouds,</HI> the fullest stor'd of any; the First rains <HI>Dul∣ness,</HI> and <HI>Arrogance</HI>; the Second, <HI>Learning</HI> and <HI>Humility.</HI> For, while the <HI>Body</HI> of the Poor is improving into <HI>Spirit,</HI> the <HI>Spirit</HI> of the Rich is degenerating into <HI>Body.</HI>'</Q> It is a pretty Remark: And every Man's Experi∣ence will
enable him to justify it. For how few Publick or Private Improvements have
been owing to our Men of Rank? And how many to the unsatisfied Application of
the Unhappy; who, finding themselves press'd, by uneasy Circumstances, <HI>whet</HI> and <HI>urge</HI> their active Talents, 'till Prosperity can
afford them <HI>Leisure</HI> to be as useless, as if they were <HI>born
to it.</HI></P>
<P>IT is plain, then, That a <HI>Nobleman,</HI> who has no other Merit,
than his Rank gives him, has no Merit at all: And is just so much more
despicable than a <HI>Commoner,</HI> who is equally worthless, as the
Duties of his Condition are <PB N="324" REF="333"/> more elevated, and
important. And that <HI>Respect,</HI> which is look'd for, by a Lord, <HI>merely as a Lord,</HI> deserves to be number'd among those Sacrifices,
which we make to Custom, at the Expence of our common Sense; and to the
Dishonour of our natural Liberty.</P>
<P>AN Essay Writer, of the last Age, who had learnt from tiresome
Experience, That he had, irrecoverably, <HI>lost</HI> those Years, which he
had spent in attending the <HI>Great,</HI> (as they love to hear themselves
call'd) quitted the Pursuit with a manly Scorn: And having ob∣serv'd, for
his Reader's Use, That these Men make no Friendships, but such as are
subser∣vient, either to their <HI>Interests,</HI> or their <HI>Plea∣sures</HI>; he closes all, with this Remark— 
<Q REND="inline">'I have so hearty a Contempt for what is commonly
called <HI>Greatness,</HI> that if I did not meet with the Word <HI>Lord,</HI> in a Prayer I repeat daily, I should never name it, but with <HI>Detestation!</HI>'</Q> And, to allow this Au∣thor but common Justice,
no Man is so fool∣ishly, a Tyrant over his own Heart, as he, that humbles
himself, to a <HI>Will,</HI> that is too proud to take Notice of it: And
waits on those, from whom he can expect nothing, but what he must dearly
pay for, in Guilt, Dishonour, or Mortification.</P>
<P>I am pleas'd with a frank Correction, of that peevish, and
humoursome, Arrogance, so inseparable from these proud Mens Beha∣viour,
as it was given, by a <HI>Syrian</HI> Doctor, <PB N="325" REF="334"/> to one of
the <HI>Caliphs</HI> of <HI>Babylon.</HI> They were Angling, upon the River <HI>Tygris</HI>; and the <HI>Caliph,</HI> growing impatient, because he had
catched nothing, ordered the Physician out of his Sight, for he was sure he
should have no Sport, in Company with one, who was so <HI>unlucky.</HI>— 
<Q REND="inline">'Nay, but methinks, reply'd the Doctor, you accuse
me a little rashly: My Father was a Drawer of Water, and my Mother but a
Slave; yet I have been Chief Favourite of many successive <HI>Caliphs,</HI> and am Rich, and Fortunate, beyond my Wishes: How then can
such a Man, as I, deserve to be call'd <HI>unlucky?</HI> But if you would
be inform'd, I can name a Person, who may, <HI>truly,</HI> be stil'd
unhappy.'</Q> The <HI>Caliph</HI> told him, he might explain himself. 
<Q REND="inline">'—It is, Sir, pursued the Physician, a Lord,
who descending, lineally, from Four illustrious <HI>Caliphs,</HI> and
being, himself too, a <HI>Caliph,</HI> sits, unmindful of his Dignity, <HI>catching Fish,</HI> like an idle Saunterer; while <HI>Ignorance</HI> and <HI>Rest,</HI> are spreading Nets, to catch <HI>his People.</HI>'</Q></P>
<P>SINCE Honours were first bestow'd, as a Reward of Mens past
Virtues, and for Ex∣citement of their Future, it seems the justest Thing
imaginable, That all <HI>Lords,</HI> who pos∣sess them, fruitlesly,
should <HI>forfeit</HI> them: And step down among the Herd, to hide the
Shame of those Defects, which, by Reason of their too high Situation, blaze
out, like a Beacon, to the Disturbance of a whole Coun∣try. 
<PB N="326" REF="335"/> As, (for the same Reason) where a Nobleman is truly
such, his Wisdom, his Courage, and his Loyalty, strike out their
Influence in larger Circles, than the Virtues of inferior Ranks can
possibly be extended to.</P>
<P>FOR my Part, as it is my Purpose to speak of every Thing like a <HI>Plain Dealer,</HI> I declare with the utmost Indifference, That, though
no Man more sincerely reverences what a Nobleman was meant to be, yet I can
have no Respect at all, for the <HI>Name,</HI> where the <HI>Thing</HI> is
wanting. On the contrary, it is my Opinion, That every Gentleman of Spi∣rit
should despise, and mortify the Vanity of such a chimerical
Superiority, as would ad∣vance itself, above <HI>substantial Honour,</HI>
by the empty Memory and <HI>Sound</HI> of it.</P>
<P>THE Breath of a Sovereign may have Power to <HI>create Titles</HI>;
But it can have none, to <HI>invert Qualities.</HI> Though the Vessel is in

Adversi∣ty. He will be compassionate, without Weakness; Brave, without
Arrogance; Con∣scious, without Pride; and Sincere, without 
<PB N="327" REF="336"/> Indecency. He will be Wary, but not Sus∣picious: And
his Anger will have no Malice. He will Love, without Folly: and Disap∣prove,
without Hatred. His Hope will be Strong, but Patient: his Fear Awake, but
Easy. He will be Active, without Hurry; and at Leisure, without Idleness:
And, at least, if he be not Learned, he will be a Lo∣ver of Learning.</P>

<P>I HAVE had the Misfortune to be Edu∣cated after the old-fashion'd
Method of our Ancestors; who were so ignorant, to in∣stil <HI>Modesty,</HI> as a Virtue, into their Female Pupils. Now, you must
know, Sir, this Place is filled, at present, with a polite Set of Ladies,
(Members of a Society, with so hard a Name, that I am afraid I shou'd
spell it wrong, so will omit it) that have Heroically resolv'd to put all
Modest Virgins out of Countenance, by staring unmerci∣fully in their Faces.
This Behaviour adds so many new Charms, and renders them so agreeable to
all they converse with, that I would gladly assume a little of this <HI>Modern</HI> Accomplishment: But the Prejudice of early imbib'd
Principles, is so strong, that, instead of answering a SMART in his own
Way, I cannot forbear Blushing, both for <PB N="329" REF="338"/> Him, and the

<P>MOST of our Neighbours, know∣ing that I have the Honour to be
related to you, have put me upon writing this Letter, to acquaint you, That
Yester∣day a strange and surprizing Creature was seen to pass through
our Town on Horse∣back: It had the Face of a young Woman, stuck full of
Patches; a Perriwig, which hung down to Its Waist; a Hat, cock'd with the
Smartness of a young Officer; a huge Bunch of Ribbons, fastened behind Its
Left-Shoulder; a Shirt laid in large <PB N="330" REF="339"/> Pleights on the
Breast, and tied close at the Neck and Wrists, which, with a Vest of
White Satten, trimm'd with Black, had much the Resemblance of a Shroud. Our
whole Town was soon alarmed with this strange Appearance, and various are
still the Opinions what It really was: The Old Peo∣ple who were the most
couragious generally, went pretty near to It, with their Specta∣cles on, to
view It more distinctly; the younger Sort kept It at an awful Distance:
Some were of Opinion, that It was a High∣wayman in Disguise, and
accordingly were for seizing It; others took It for a Nun; but by a certain
arch Lear It had with Its Eyes, I dare engage It had not a Bit of Nun's Flesh
about It: However, by its pale Complexion, and Shroudlike Dress, most of my
Neighbours, at last, concluded It to be a Ghost, and so took to their
Heels, and left me, (who am no great Believer in these Things) almost alone
with It in the Road. I had now an Opportunity. during the Time It was drinking
a Glass of <HI>Rhe∣nish Wine</HI> and <HI>Sugar,</HI> at the <HI>Saracen's-head-Inn,</HI> to survey It well, and thereupon, con∣cluding It
to be an <HI>Hermaphrodite,</HI> I enqui∣red of the Man, who seemed to have
the keeping of It, If he intended to shew It in our Town? and at what Inn?
for, you must know, Sir, that I have a mighty Cu∣riosity to see one of
those Creatures all over: But the Man, with an angry Coun∣tenance, 
<PB N="331" REF="340"/> told me, That what I took for an <HI>Hermaphrodite,</HI>
was only a young Lady, and that the Sort of Dress she was in, was commonly
worn for a <HI>Riding-Habit</HI> by the Ladies of Fashion at <HI>London</HI>:
But as nei∣ther I, nor my Neighbours, can believe it possible for Folks,
upon no ill Design, to disguise themselves in such a Manner, I
desire you will, in one of your PLAIN-DEALERS, (for we have it constantly
brought to us by our Coach) inform us of the Truth, which will tend very much
to the Satisfaction of the best Part of our Town, who are your Readers; and

<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE few Lines, I sent to you, on the 27th of the last Month,
were in∣tended for the Diversion of your Readers, and were the Dictates of a
Mind at Ease. I write to you now, with a quite different' 
<PB N="334" REF="343"/> Spirit, and on a more substantial and solid
Motive. My Heart was then, so light, that I little thought it would, in so
short a Time, grow so heavy as I now find it. I am in Pain about a very
worthy Relation of ours, young Mr. <HI>Truelove,</HI> who, being just
return'd from his Travels, is married to a young Lady, upon whom he had
secretly set his Heart for some Years before he went Abroad. The
Perplexity of the Case is, That he has married her, without the Knowledge of
his Father, and that the good old Gentleman, without the Know∣ledge of his Son,
had provided for him a Lady, Beautiful like her, himself has cho∣sen, and
young, like her; Equal in Fa∣mily, but vastly Superior in Point of For∣tune.
Never was there a more Paternal Affection, than my Uncle <HI>Truelove</HI> has
shewn innumerable Marks of to his Son; nor were there ever more Tokens of
Filial Piety, than my Cousin has taken all Oc∣casions to demonstrate
towards his Father. It would be a wonderous Pity, that any Misunderstanding
should happen between so loving and beloved a Father, and so lov∣ing and
beloved a Son: And yet we are all in mighty Apprehensions, that this
Marri∣age may occasion a fatal Breach between them. The Father placed the
Prospect of the Son's Happiness in his having a Wife with a plentiful
Fortune. The Son thought that, with Regard to his own Happiness, 
<PB N="335" REF="344"/> no Fortune could be put in Competition with the Value of
the Woman, whose Virtue, Beauty, and Innocence, had en∣dear'd her to his
Heart. The Father (if all our Family guesses right, and much I fear we do)
will be inraged at the Loss of an Estate, in which he had imaginarily
pla∣ced the whole Sum of his Son's Felicity in this World; he will tax him of
Impru∣dence, tell him he has thrown himself away, and call this Marriage so
enter'd upon with∣out his Knowledge or Consent, an Act of Disobedience. My
Cousin, who bears a tender and an affectionate Heart, will ill brook these
Rebukes, that make his Fa∣ther seem to undervalue the precious Crea∣ture,
whom he, above all the World, holds dear; he will not, he cannot, suffer
them. He will justify his Choice; He will be warm in the Defence of the Fair
One his Father has despised; He will speak with Indifference of the
Fortune; his Father had with Pains been seeking, in Compari∣son of her, and
maintain the Privilege of his being of Age, and free to chuse for himself.
Thus their very Affections, by this different Notion, they have of
Hap∣piness, may be the Causes of their Diffe∣rence; and since those,
who have a Vio∣lence in the Passion of Love, carry with them that Violence
into other Passions, we are apt to fear, that, unless some Precauti∣ons
be taken, the Rupture may be dange∣rous; <PB N="336" REF="345"/> and we rather
think, by gentle Me∣thods, to break the Force of the Disap∣pointment in the
Manner of discovering the Marriage to the Old Gentleman, than leave him to
the Chance of a hasty Fury, upon his suddenly discovering it himself.
We are all on the Son's Side, before the Matter breaks out; and we have a Mind
to make it up with the Old Gentleman, as it were without his own Knowledge. Our
Contrivance is, what I am sure your Hu∣manity will prompt you to help
forward; that you should pen a Paper, in Defence of the Right which young Men
have of chusing for themselves, and against the Hardship there would be
in a Father's interposing his Au∣thority against the Inclinations of his
Son, in the Case of Marriage, and after we have read that to him, we will
open it by De∣grees. Though it is more particularly ours at present, yet it
is the World's Concern: The Young of both Sexes will be pleased with the
Speculation, and it may be very extensively beneficial. If that Fatherly
Gentleman, that wise Companion of yours, the Major, joins with you in
supporting the Cause of the young People, two such Au∣thorities will be
of great Weight with the old Ones, and, at least reconcile them so far to
this general Opinion of all Children, that when such Accidents happen, they
will not stand in need of so many Argu∣ments to reconcile them to their
Persons. <PB N="337" REF="346"/> In complying with this, you will give great
Ease and Satisfaction to our whole Family, and particularly to,</P>

</LETTER>
<P>WHEN this Letter came to my Hands, the Major happened to be present,
and as soon as I had look'd it over, I told him, He had a Right to read it;
he did so, and returning it with a Smile, <HI>Your Kinswoman</HI> (said
he) <HI>makes a very reasonable Request</HI>; The Old People, who are
generally in the Right, when they differ from the Young, will not be angry with
us, their Coaevals and Well-wishers, if we should endeavour to shew, that
the young People are not al∣together in the Wrong in this Point. <HI>For my
share, I must frankly declare, That, when young People are at Years of
Discretion before they marry, the Law of Nature and Reason, seems to
speak them Free to chuse for themselves, since they, and not their
Parents, for no less a Term than Life, are to enjoy the</HI> Happiness <HI>of a</HI> Right <HI>Choice, or feel the</HI> Smart <HI>of a</HI> Wrong <HI>one.</HI> The Major and I agreed in this Sentiment, and had a long
Discourse upon <PB N="338" REF="347"/> the Subject, which, when I got Home,
threw me into the following Reflections.</P>
<P>OF all the Affections, which move and act pleasurably upon the Frame
of Human Na∣ture, <HI>Plato</HI> reckons Love the most desirable: <HI>For
He,</HI> saith this curious Philosopher, <HI>who is thoroughly affected
with this Passion, removes his Soul to the Place, where he has settled
his Affections, and loses Himself to find the Object he doats upon.</HI>
This pleasant Straying, this delightful Wandering of the Soul from its own
Mansion, is a beautiful Description of the Force of Love, and the Power,
which those, who were created to charm, have to transport us, as it were,
from the Government of Ourselves, into their own absolute Dominion. A
Passion, which is, of its own Nature, so violent, ren∣ders Men
excusable, in a great measure, when they seem to misplace it: They
cannot be said to be guilty of a Fault in disobeying their Relations, when
they are transported beyond the Power of giving Law to themselves. They are <HI>sunk in the soft Captivity,</HI> and Cap∣tives, are not free Agents:
Neither is it hard it should be so in Nature; on the contrary, as good and
virtuous Women, alone, have the <HI>full</HI> Power of moving and captivating
the Soul in the manner I mention, it is so far from being an Evil, that it is
a Blessing to be highly coveted. The Man, who is born of a good Mother,
says little enough, when, transported by her Desert, he calls Women the
Ornaments of Mankind in their <PB N="339" REF="348"/> Prosperity, and their
Supports in Adversity; There is no being happy in Life without them.</P>
<P><HI>PLATO,</HI> in another Place, has carried the Sentiment to a more
agreeable Height, he says, <HI>The Soul of a Man, in Love, dieth in his own
Body, and liveth in anothers.</HI> This is Energy of Expression; and yet
there is not more of Strength and Delicacy, than of Pro∣priety and
Justness: For, the Soul of a Man in Love, is dead to all other Appetites.
The Man, who was in Love with Riches, and ea∣ger in the Pursuit of Honour,
before he be∣held the Fair One, who captivated his Soul, the Moment his Heart
confesses itself a Victim to the Enchantment of Beauty, looks no longer
upon Honour and Riches as the Two principal Movements, they grow only
secondary Bless∣ings, and are no farther valued than as they may help him
to comfort, and adorn the adored Companion of his Life. Love is really, witn
regard to other Affections, what the Philoso∣pher's Stone is pretended to be,
with regard to Metals: It inriches, and ennobles every Thing it touches: It is
the genuine Elixir, that gives a golden Tincture to every Dispo∣sition of
the Mind; it heightens Ambition; it inlarges Generosity; it quickens Joy; it
banishes Envy; it extinguishes Lust; it en∣livens the Virtues, and
extirpates the Vices of Men in all Ranks and Conditions of Life. Is there a
King, who is a Lover of Money? The Beauty whom he languishes to make a 
<PB N="340" REF="349"/> Queen, is valued beyond all his Treasure: Is there a
Courtier that is warm in the Pursuit of a Coronet? Let him be in Love, and
his Mistress is his <HI>Pride</HI>: Without her, the Co∣ronet will not
hinder his Head from aching: A <HI>Garter</HI> will less assuage the
Swellings of his proud Heart, than a <HI>Favour</HI> of her be∣stowing. A Man
that has a Fulness of Joy in his Composition, will grow melancholy, if he
loses the fair Object of his Desires; Musick cannot please where her
Voice is not heard: Equipage, Embroideries, and Brocades are false Colours
upon the Heart that is inwardly in Mourning. The Envious Man envies no Body but
his Rival, while he continues a Lover. The Lustful forgets his Appetites
after Va∣riety of Women. What Parent can ratio∣nally expect to be heard, when
he undertakes to plead against such powerful Impressions? All the
Urgings of Duty will be of no Effect; all the Arguments that can be used,
will be no Arguments to these; all the World, beside his Mistress, is
nothing to the Man that is in Love, and She is all the World to him.</P>
<P>WHAT can they hope to propose to a Son in this Condition, thar will
deter him from his Purposes? Will they propose to him a Women, whom they
think more beautiful and agreeable, and that as an infinite Superiority of
Fortune, above the Fair One, that is his own Choice; Let her be as great a
Fortune as she pleases, she is no Fortune at all to him: She would be,
with all her Wealth, the Load <PB N="341" REF="350"/> and Calamity of his Life. <HI>Love,</HI> he would say, <HI>is built upon the Union of Minds; Hearts are
not to be bribed by Gold, and true Passion is not to be bought off by the
Treasure of both</HI> Indies. He can have no Relish in Possessions,
that his desired Partner shares not. Will they add, That besides Fortune,
the Mistress they recommend, has infinitely more of Beauty in the World's
Eyes? He will answer, The World's Eye is none of his; he will grant, even
that she may have Defects, and will not stop to say, <HI>That he is even
in Love with those Defects.</HI> In fine, All they can propose will never
avail, nor is it, indeed, reasonable that it should. If they threaten him
with their Displeasure, and tax him with want of Duty, he will tell them,
That he is dutiful in all other Points; he will be sor∣ry for their
Displeasure, but cannot obey in this One Case; he will make this
undeniable Quotation in his Defence, That <HI>he is to leave his Father and
Mother, and cleave to his Wife.</HI> And, truly, if his Parents think, that he
sins against Prudence in chusing a slender Fortune, all the World will
judge, that they would sin against Justice, if, forcing his
In∣clinations, they make him Wretched, under Pretence of making him Rich, and
render him Miserable, under the Colour of making him Fortunate.</P>

<P>THE Complaint of <HI>CHLOE,</HI> in the ensuing Letter seems to be
formed up∣on so laudable a Desire of making her Hus∣band more agreeable to
her, that without being entirely uncomplaisant, and void of all Gallantry
whatsoever, there is no such Thing as refusing to insert it, or denying
her all the Assistance, that such a Plain Old Man, as I am, shall be
able to give her, to∣wards procuring her a proper Redress from her
Husband.—It is, indeed, a nice and ticklish Matter to have any Thing to
do be∣tween married Folks; and, unless I had great Hopes of doing good, I
should have little Inclination to meddle in it.</P>
<P><PB N="343" REF="352"/>BUT I remember to have heard a particu∣lar
Case once, when a very Reverend Divine was applied to, by both Parties, to
accom∣modate a Difference between them; the holy Man, excused himself, with
a venerable Shrug, saying, <HI>That he had laid it down as a Maxim, Never to
go between a Man and his Wife, on any Consideration whatever.</HI>—A
Friend of mine, who knew both the Man and the Wife, assured me, That the
first Grounds of their Difference were too ridicu∣lous to bear being told;
but, that both being very stiff and obstinate not to yield an Inch on
either Side, were, however, inwardly ashamed, and wanted nothing more
earnestly than a Pretence to come together by the In∣terposition of the
Divine: If the <HI>Doctor</HI> had only used <HI>Will. Weathercock's</HI>
healing Method, and said no more, but that, <HI>Tho' both of them had been in
the Wrong, yet both of them were in the Right too,</HI> all would certainly
have come right, and they have been as good Friends as ever.</P>
<P>FOR this Reason therefore, I shall never think it a Matter of
Scruple to thrust in be∣tween a discontented Couple. My Corre∣spondent <HI>CHLOE</HI> complains of a very ob∣vious and visible Obstruction, that
is easy, and will be even <HI>refreshing</HI> to her Husband to <HI>take
off,</HI> and I comply with her Desire of inserting the Complaint,
because, I confide, that her Husband's Compliance with the Prayer of her
Petition, will be the Conse∣quence of mine.</P>

<P>THIS very Day makes it exactly Half a Year, since I became a Wife.
My Husband, when he made his Applications to me, always appeared Gay, Genteel,
and Debonnair. But, about Two Months af∣ter we had tyed the <HI>Gordian</HI>
Knot, He be∣gan to dress in a more negligent Manner. He now appears so much
the Reverse of what he did formerly, in Point of Dress, that the Neighbours
look upon it as a bad Compliment to his Yoke-Mate. Before Matrimony, his Chin
was scarce shaded. But now, the <HI>Barber</HI> is never sent for but on
a <HI>Saturday</HI> Night. This strange <HI>Meta∣morphosis,</HI> you may
naturally suppose, is no ways agreeable to me. I assure you, Sir, I
have spared no Pains to prevail with my Deary, to make his Appearance, in a
Man∣ner suitable to his Station. However, my repeated Petitions have, all of
them, prov∣ed ineffectual. I therefore, beg of you, Mr. PLAIN DEALER, to give
me your Assistance in this Affair, and you will high∣ly oblige,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your very Humble Servant, <HI>CHLOE.</HI></SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>IF the Maxim of the above-mentioned Divine was to be followed in our
present Case, <PB N="345" REF="354"/> I do not know where this Complaint
might end, and whether it would not come to an open Rupture: It is certain, the
most remarkable Divorces have arisen from as small Beginnings. The very
Letter of this young Lady, shews her to be a neat and cleanly Person, and
therefore her Complaint of this (I cannot help terming it) <HI>dirty</HI>
Usage, carries the greater Weight with it. I can, methinks, behold this young
Sloven approaching the tender Thing, and embracing her in a man∣ner that turns
Pleasure into a Torment; I see him hold her struggling against a
Kiss, his Arms round her unwilling Neck, force her Face to his dreaded Lip;
he is put to the Necessity of <HI>ravishing</HI> a Kiss from his own
Wife, and yet is ignorant of the Meaning.—He takes it, however, by
Violence.—She looks half pleased, half angry, hangs down her Head,
hides the Water in her Eyes, pushes him, between Jest and Earnest, from
her Bosom; rubs her glowing and smarting Mouth, calls him <HI>Rough
Thing!</HI> with half a tender-laughing, and a half-whining Voice.—The
unpolish'd Creature casts a Booby Stare at her, and is stupidly at a
Loss to know why she struggles so hard against what she likes:
Unless he is told, point-blank, That his Beard is the Cause of all the
Disor∣der, he cannot perceive that her Cheeks look red and angry with his
Kisses, and wear ra∣ther the Print of Fury than Love. He must be told,
That a delicate Skin was never <PB N="346" REF="355"/> form'd to be brush'd
over by a bristly Beard, that is rough, and stubborn, like the Hu∣mour that
lets it grow. I call it more parti∣cularly <HI>stubborn</HI> in this
unaccountable young Fellow, for she has told, and told him of it again and
again, in plain Terms, and he, notwithstanding all this, pertinaciously
conti∣nues to go <HI>rough.</HI> Now is it not a preposte∣rous way of acting,
after all, that when a <HI>Lover,</HI> he should shave close, for fear of
of∣fending the Eye of a Mistress whom he was uncertain of obtaining; and
yet let it grow, when a <HI>Husband,</HI> without having the Fear of wounded
Beauty before his Eyes; and without any Apprehensions of hurting that Face by
his Roughness, that charm'd him by its Softness.</P>
<P>I DWELL the more upon this Subject, as in∣considerable as it may
seem to some, because it is a Male Vice that I have frequently ta∣ken
Notice of, and as often wish'd to see re∣medied for the sake of the fair
Sufferers, who are wedded to such unpolish'd Barbarians. A Marriage
Conversation ought to humanize and temper Men; on the contrary, these,
in∣stead of growing tamer, are made more sa∣vage by Matrimony.</P>
<P>YOU shall see a Lover in a fine Campaign Peruque, and an
embroider'd Suit of Cloaths, alter'd into a Husband, with an aukward Country
Bob, and a Surtout made out of a Rug. You shall find his Manners following
his Dress, and his Complaisance degenerating <PB N="347" REF="356"/> into
Bluntness. It is in all Degrees alike. You shall see one, whom before
Marriage, you would take for a Lord, alter'd, after it, into a Coachman; many
that seemed Senators transmuted into Jockies; a hundred ceremo∣nious Beaus
turn'd Clowns, and numberless Sir <HI>Clements</HI> transformed into Country <HI>Lob∣bins.</HI></P>
<P>SURE, as old as I am, I have a more amorous Nature in me still, than
these my∣sterious young Fellows, whose Affections and Actions are so
different, I cannot tell what to make of them. I can easily guess it would
tickle my Ear strangely, to hear a young beautiful Creature telling me, how I
should become more agreeable to her, by adorning myself, and intreating me
to do it. For Ex∣ample, if <HI>Patty Amble</HI> and I were upon ab∣solute
Terms of Agreement, There are not any little Customs, that I would not depart
from for her Ease. As fix'd an Aversion as I have profess'd against
clouded Canes, I should, however, be easily perswaded to carry a painted
Stick, instead of an Oaken, if by <HI>walking</HI> with it, I was sure to
make <HI>Progres∣sion</HI> in my Wife's Affection; nay, I would admit a <HI>Knot of Ribbons</HI> to it into the Bar∣gain, provided it would render our <HI>Marriage-Knot</HI> the easier. Again, I have known Wo∣men, who have a
prodigious Aversion to a <HI>Mouse,</HI> and are not only very wary at
guard∣ing their Petticoats upon the Approach of that little noxious and nimble
Animal, but <PB N="348" REF="357"/> do not even care that any Thing, which looks
the least like it, should come near them: Now, if my <HI>Patty</HI> was of
that Temper, I, who know how far Women are apt to stretch some Antipathies,
would alter the very Colour of my Gloves for fear of Offence; and though I have
affected <HI>Mouse-colour</HI> for so many Years, I would fit myself with
a Pair of White, or, at least, of a less frightful Complexion, before I
would come within Arm's Length of her Hoop. In fine, tho' I wear a little <HI>Mustache</HI> (the Fashion when I was young, and a Peculiarity I have
not mentioned of myself 'till this Day) that would rather tickle than offend,
yet sooner than that should interpose, it should be de∣voted to the
Edge of the Razor. For I am absolutely for rescinding the least
Obstacles between a Man and his Wife, before Mat∣ters are carried too
far.</P>
<P>A GREAT many People will object, that these are Trifles; but I
say, They are Mat∣ters that have more Consequences than they dream of.
However, granting the Objection true, if conforming one's-self in little
Mat∣ters is sufficient to please, it is the least a Man can do, to
indulge so amiable a Crea∣ture.</P>
<P>COMPLIANCE in Dress, is a Piece of Matrimonial Wisdom, <HI>Fine
Feathers making fine Birds:</HI> Women often chuse more judici∣ously than
the Men; and have Regard to <PB N="349" REF="358"/> Sense, Temper, and
Behaviour, but they will have a Mixture of Appearance too, in the Composition
of their Man, if possible; and Dress passes, with some of them,
even beyond Looks; insomuch, that though Fi∣nery, in the general Rule, be the
Glory and darling Passion of a Woman, yet there are Exceptions of many, who
would rather see their Husbands fine, than themselves. No∣thing is more
common, than to hear <HI>ordinary</HI> Women, especially, who, after they are
mar∣ried, are very free in declaring the Source of their Affections, say,
That the Neatness of her Husband, the Smugness of his Look, and the
Cleverness of his Shape, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> first made her in Love with him.
If this be the Case, when the Cause ceases, the Effect will cease too:
The Moment he grows dirty, wears a long Beard, or drowns himself in a large <HI>Josephus,</HI> the pleasant Picture, that his Wife had painted of him,
in her Fancy, va∣nishes; and if not re-imprinted sometimes, her Liking
insensibly wears away. In fine, as much Trifles as these are, a Wife's
Heart, if <HI>that</HI> be a Trifle, is lost by the Disuse of them; and
perhaps made a <HI>trifling</HI> Present of, to a Stranger that minds
Dressing.</P>
<P>I HAVE been credibly informed, That it is a political Piece of
Cunning, among those unlucky Sparks, who affect to shine by the Means of
modish Wickedness, to observe, how the Husband, who grows careless
after Marriage, appeared in the Times of his <PB N="350" REF="359"/>
Courtship, and to equip themselves accord∣ingly. They Play the Part of the <HI>Suiter</HI> so well upon the <HI>Husband,</HI> as to estrange from him
the Affections of his Spouse, and transfer them to their proper Purpose.
They dress in the same Manner, wear Cloaths of the same Colour, are
punctual in his very Pinch and Cock of the Hat, mimick his Air, Gait, Mien, and
by this Policy in Love, make the Husband his own Rival. But as the Face is the
Mart of Love, so these Inconveniencies happen mostly from an Over-neglect
of that Part; the being not shaved ruffles a Wo∣man's Temper against her
Husband; while the Gallant, by being trimm'd, smooths a Passage to her
Inclination.</P>
<P>I AM sure, if the Case stands thus, a Bar∣ber is an Artisan of
Importance, since, be∣sides taking off the <HI>Beard,</HI> he lops away
such growing Evils.</P>
<P>LET Him, therefore, that values his Head, look to his Beard; and be
mindful.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub"><DATE>FRIDAY, <HI>August</HI> 14. 1724.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>EVER since I was a School-Boy, I have been fond of walking in <HI>Westminster-Abbey,</HI> where, when my Heart is heated, by the Violence
of some unruly Passion, I enjoy a cool Composure, and a kind of
Venerable Refreshment.—Its dusky Cloisters, majest∣ick Isles,
Quire, Organs, Royal Tombs, and reverend Variety of strong, impressive,
Images, have a never-failing Power to <HI>reduce</HI> my Mind from Transport,
when Hope, Prosperity, or Pleasure, have betray'd it into Vanity; or, to <HI>relieve</HI> it, when disorder'd, by a Weight of Anguish, or
Oppression.</P>
<P><HI>DEATH, and the Sun,</HI> says a <HI>French</HI> Writer, <HI>are
Two Things not to be look'd upon with a steady Eye.</HI>—Though there
is something in his Observation, rather pretty, than just, yet so far
is certainly true, That we are un∣qualify'd <PB N="352" REF="361"/> to think,
serenely, on our <HI>Dissolu∣tion,</HI> while we are surrounded by the
Noise, and Hurry of the World, in its ambitious Scenes; or soften'd into
sensual Wishes, by the Languor of an idle Solitude.—While <HI>we</HI> are Part of our own Prospect we can never view it justly: But,
in such a Situation as the <HI>Abbey,</HI> we are plac'd as it were, out of
our∣selves, and, from this ancient <HI>Stand</HI> of Death, look back upon a
Country, which we seem no longer to have any Concern in; and which, therefore
we can judge of with the necessary Clearness and Impartiality.</P>
<P>THE Mind that is stedfast enough to medi∣tate, calmly, on Death,
will be arm'd to re∣sist the Strength, and the Flattery, of human
Passions.—Such Thoughts, if they make us not <HI>better,</HI> will,
at least, make us <HI>wiser</HI>; since that must moderate our
Wishes. which puts us out of Countenance at their Levity: And, who can
reflect, without being asham'd, that while every Thing, in <HI>Life,</HI> is
accidental, and <HI>Death,</HI> the only Certainty; we go on to act
notwithstanding, as if all Things, else were <HI>in∣fallible,</HI> and
Death but <HI>accidental.</HI></P>
<P>I, sometimes, suffer myself to be shut up for Five or Six
Hours among the <HI>Tombs,</HI> where I sit down without Ceremony, or
Reprehen∣sion, among the proudest of those Princes, who were once, too
stately to be convers'd with, but at Distance, and with Fear and
Re∣verence.—I possess, in common, with the Spiders (their
Companions, and most con∣stant <PB N="353" REF="362"/> Servants, who
spread Net-work over their Trophies) the unenvied Privilege of sur∣rounding
those last Beds of forgotten Ma∣jesty.—Here I bury myself, in
solemn Si∣lence, and imprint my Imagination with Images, which awaken Thought
and prepare me for Humility.—The stain'd, and melancholy Light, that
enters faintly through the painted Windows, as if it wore a decent <HI>Mourning,</HI> to become the Scene it opens to me, guides me, slowly, by
the cloister'd Allies, dusty Tombs, and weeping Statues, till I am lost
in that still Pomp of figur'd Sorrow, which, on every Side, incloses
me.</P>
<Q> 
<L>From finish'd Pray'r, the Flock disperse apace,</L> 
<L>And each glad Foot forsakes the dreary Place:</L> 
<L>The hooded <HI>Prebend,</HI> plods along before;</L> 
<L>And the last <HI>Virger,</HI> claps the ringing Door.</L> 
<L>Then, thoughtful, ling'ring, curious, and alone,</L> 
<L>In the dark Temple, when the rest are gone,</L> 
<L>No Noise invades my Ear; No murm'ring Breath</L> 
<L>Not one low <HI>Whisper,</HI> in the <HI>Hall</HI> of <HI>Death!</HI></L> 
<L>No trampling Sound swims o'er the silent Floor;</L> 
<L>But the slow <HI>Clock,</HI> that counts the sliding Hour!</L></Q>
<P>HERE, indulging Contemplation, I forget my Cares, and Misfortunes, and
disencumber myself from the Forms, and Embarrassments of Converse. I
become the Inhabitant of a quiet, and unbusy World, where all is serene and
peaceful: I am disturb'd by no Fears, inflam'd by no Anger, inspir'd by no
Hope, tormented by no Jealousy: I can expect, <PB N="354" REF="363"/> whitout
Impatience; and be disappointed, without Affliction: The Dust, which is
scat∣ter'd round me, and which once, was Living Flesh, as I am, choaks the
Fountains of my Pride, and produces in me a Mortification, that is too strong
for all my Passions.</P>
<P>I WAS present, very lately, when of those Monumental Historians,
whose Imployment it is to draw a Profit from reading Lectures, on these
Resting Places of our antient Princes, was shewing the Tomb of <HI>Henry
the Fifth,</HI> to a Circle of Holiday Strollers.—After having inform'd
the tasteless Wonderers, That this was <HI>He</HI> who <HI>conquer'd</HI>
France! That His <HI>Son</HI> was <HI>crown'd</HI> in <HI>Paris</HI>! That he
married <HI>the French King's Daughter</HI>! And what else he had been Able
to collect from the Records of this great Prince's Reign; he pointed to a
Plain, Wooden, Worm-eaten, Coffin, that was plac'd upon the Ground, by this
Tomb's Side, and told them, That it contain'd the Body of Queen <HI>Catherine,</HI> the beautiful Wife of this Triumphant <HI>Henry.</HI>—Adding, That for a small, additional, Contribution, he
would unlock the Coffin, and let them look in upon her Corpse, which lay
there, perfect, and undecay'd, though she had been dead al∣most Three
hundred Years. They had Curi∣osity enough to pay the Price demanded, and the
Proposer made good his Promise, unveiling to their Sight, and Touch, the
Reliques of that Royal Charmer.</P>
<P><PB N="355" REF="364"/>I CANNOT express the Indignation, and Con∣cern
which this Scene gave me.—Her lovely Limbs, which, once, were thought too
ten∣der for the Wind to blow upon; and which were never seen without Joy,
Reverence, and Wonder, by the Conqueror of Her Father's Kingdom, and the
Sovereign of This in which she died: <HI>Now,</HI> lay neglected, and
expos'd! denied even Earth to cover her! and made a Spectacle, for
Entertainment of a Croud of common Wanderers!</P>
<P>SUPERIOR, as this Lady was, in her Beauty Birth, and Fortune, what
Prae-eminence in Death have all these given her above the <HI>Meanest,</HI>
and most <HI>Unlovely?</HI>—After hav∣ing made her <HI>Life</HI> a
changeful Course of Sor∣row and Calamity, they left her destitute, in <HI>Death,</HI> without the Decency of a <HI>Grave</HI> to <HI>shelter</HI>
her!—There, now, she lies, a Proof of transitory Greatness! To
comfort the <HI>Wretched,</HI> with this Reflection, when they look in upon her
expos'd Remains, that <HI>Nature</HI> has made no Difference between a <HI>Royal,</HI> and a <HI>Vulgar,</HI> Body; But, that, taking away what was
added by <HI>Fortune,</HI> each, from the Moment of Death, is the other's Equal
to Eternity.</P>
<P>WHAT Rank, or Condition, is there among us, which may not draw, from
this great School of Moral Reasoning, some Observa∣tion for their
Benefit?—Even the <HI>Unwary</HI> and <HI>Extravagant,</HI> whose Lives
are a con∣tinued Luxury! and to whom the Miseries <PB N="356" REF="365"/> of <HI>Debt</HI> appear remote, and without Terror! Even <HI>They,</HI> may find a
Lesson among these <HI>Tombs</HI>; for there they may be shewn the
Bodies of great Men, doing Penance in their Velvet Coffins, and <HI>imprison'd after Death,</HI> to satisfy the Malice of their stubborn
Creditors, as if the Influence of sordid Money could extend its Cruelties
beyond Life, and had a Privilege to disturb, by Avarice, the sleeping
Ashes of de∣parted Sovereigns!</P>
<P>IS a Man insulted? wrong'd? betray'd? Does he hate his
distrusted Enemy? Are his Thoughts imploy'd on Revenge? And does he break
his Sleep with Stratagems, to avoid, or retaliate, the Injustice that may be
done him? Let him walk with me in this instruct∣ive Circle, and I will shew
him the Dust of a murder'd Monarch, mixing quietly with <HI>his</HI> who
murder'd him.—I will tread with him over Earth that is passive, and
ferments not, though compos'd of united Atoms from the mingl'd Bodies of
those Men, whose bat∣tling Interests and Affections, while they <HI>liv'd,</HI> shook the Kingdom like an Earthquake!—When the <HI>Quarrelsome</HI> consider <HI>This</HI> they ought to blush at their
little Hatreds, and grow asham'd to let their Souls be divided by
Animosity, when Death may crumple their Bodies together, and incorporate them
with their most malicious Enemy!</P>
<P>THERE is no Fortune so <HI>exalted,</HI> but it may find a <HI>Check</HI> in this dark Mansion: Nor any Condition so <HI>dejected,</HI> but that it may <PB N="357" REF="366"/> be sure of a <HI>Comfort</HI>: Every Stone that we look upon, in this Repository of past
Ages, is an <HI>Entertainment,</HI> and a <HI>Monitor.</HI>—I never leave
its venerable Gloom, without finding my Mind cooler, and more compos'd than
when I enter'd.—I sink deep into myself, and see my Heart without
Disguise; in its good, or evil Propensities: And I ga∣ther Power from
these strong Impressions to re∣sist Pleasure, Pride, Ambition, or
low Avarice: And to fortify the Impulses of Humility, For∣giveness,
Charity, and the Virtues of Con∣tent and Quietude.</P>
<P>THERE was publish'd, a few Years since, a Poem, call'd
WESTMINSTER-ABBEY. I am sorry the Author's Name was not printed with it.
There is somthing highly elevated in his Genius, that is sweetly serious,
and sublimely melancholy!—The Verses insert∣ed above, I am indebted
for to that Poem: And I shall borrow from the same Piece, these
following, which, I will take the Liberty to affirm, are as fine ones, as were
ever written.—I ask Pardon for a Transposition, and Alteration, or
Two, which I have only made, that I might have the Pleasure of collecting
into one view, as many of the Beauties, as could possibly be drawn together
in the narrow Compass of my Paper.</P>

<LETTER>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>Mr. PLAIN DEALER,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Am an old Man, as you are, and when I reflect on the fantastick
Vicissitude of human Affairs; when I consider the Short∣ness of Life,
and the small Pretensions I have to any longer Share in it, it fills my
Mind with something grave, solemn, and, I must own, melancholy; but when
I give my Thoughts a more unbounded Scope, and pass over that short
Intermission of Life, into the Contemplation of an Eternal 
<PB N="361" REF="370"/> Being, my Mind recovers from that Gloom, which the
first Reflection fill'd me with, and grows gay, in Proportion to the
Influ∣ence which this latter has upon it.</P>
<P>I WAS, last Night, reading that celebrated Speech of <HI>Cato</HI>
whence I have taken the Motto, with which I head this Letter, and whether it
was from the serious Thoughts which that Soliloquy inspired, or the last
strong Glimpses of a Mind almost expiring, and habituated to such
Speculations, I am not able to determine; but I was no sooner fallen
asleep, than the following Dream, or rather <HI>Vision,</HI> grew into
Form, and fill'd my Fancy.</P>
<Q> 
<P>METHOUGHT the dreadful Hour was come, in which I was to resign
this Life; my Bed was surrounded by a silent Company of weeping Friends,
whose Sorrows touch'd me more, than my own approaching Dissolution, which
happen'd in less Time, than human Nature can con∣ceive, and therefore (though
at that Period I felt it sensibly) it is impossible I should now
describe it. I was no sooner freed from the Incumbrance, and Obscurity,
of <HI>Mat∣ter,</HI> but my Soul became refined to such an infinite Degree of
Conception, that my Eyes, having nothing to interrupt, or con∣fine their View,
were strengthen'd with such piercing Beams, that they darted every Glance
through an innumerable Pro∣gression <PB N="362" REF="371"/> of Worlds, and
illuminated me with a particular, and perfect, Knowledge of the Harmony, and
Fabrick of each ex∣tended System.</P> 
<P>WHILST I was thus lost in Contem∣plation (for infinite Spare, like
an endless Source, still afforded me new Objects to nourish that
inextinguishable Thirst of Knowledge, which is the Employment of Eternal
Life) I felt a Heavenly Transport, which diffus'd itself, swifter than
Thought, through the Frame of my new Being; and which, at the same Time it
made my Soul tremble with its Influence, invigora∣ted, and enabled it to
support the Energy.</P> 
<P>I NOW enjoy'd perfect Felicity, and whilst my Soul (whose
Desire of Know∣ledge increased in proportion with its Power to gratify it)
imploy'd each different Sen∣sation in pursuit of that Branch, which which
was peculiar to its Nature; on a sud∣den, I heard an universal Crack, which
seem'd to arise from the whole Number of created Worlds, and resounded
from Globe to Globe, with a long Continuance of rever∣berated Uproars.</P> 
<P>AT last, the Chain that link'd them in that dependant Order, in
which, from the first Moment of their Creation, they have perpetually been
moving, shiver'd, of it∣self: The loosen'd Orbs, thus disunited, began
to roll, with an unconceivable Swift∣ness, through the vast Expanse of
Space, <PB N="363" REF="372"/> and met, and shock'd each other in the dark
Vacuity! The <HI>Sun,</HI> now robb'd of Light, whirl'd rapid, and irregular!
The <HI>Moon</HI> let loose her Seas, and rain'd a De∣luge in her falling!
The <HI>fixed Stars,</HI> that, from the Birth of Time, had kept their
appointed Stations, no longer aw'd by the all-powerful <HI>Word,</HI> broke
loose, and rush'd together. Prodigious was the Sound! and horrible the
Conflict! The Elements, for∣getting their respective Qualities, and urg'd by
the immutable Decree, met, all, and <HI>mix'd,</HI> and lost themselves, in
ruinous Confusion.</P> 
<P>WHEN all seem'd bury'd in profoundest Darkness, the wild
Uproar ceas'd at once; and as I wonder'd at this sudden Silence, a Pyramid of
Fire broke thro', that in a Moment, enwrapp'd the Whole, and, having nothing
left to prey upon, at length, devour'd it self.</P> 
<P>THUS was the <HI>End</HI> of <HI>All!</HI> When from that
inaccessible Brightness, where the Di∣vine Presence conceals, yet makes
it self known, a Beam of Day shot out, which lighting up the infinite
Extent of Heaven, and rendering it transparent, discover'd all its Glories.
I there perceiv'd the Stream of Life, which running through the midst of
Heaven, <HI>quicken'd</HI> where-ever it roll'd, and watering the Tree of
Knowledge, nou∣rish'd it eternally: Next, I saw numberless Swarms of
Beings, like myself, that fill'd <PB N="364" REF="373"/> the Vastness of
Infinitude, and seem'd lost, like me, in Wonder, Praise, and Adora∣tion.
I heard a Voice (which had more Influence, than the most perfect Harmony of
human Art, and communicated itself to all alike) cry, <HI>Come, Eat of the
Tree of Knowledge, and Drink of the Water of Life.</HI></P> 
<P>IMMEDIATELY the Angelick Host, and all the Children of Earth (who,
by Obedience to this Command, were become one, and the same) eat, and drank,
as they were commanded. The first Effect of this, that I found on myself,
and per∣ceived in all the rest, was a perfect Recol∣lection of whatever I had
done since my first entering into Life: Various were the Consequences!
The <HI>Ungrateful,</HI> the <HI>Mur∣therer,</HI> the <HI>Miser,</HI> the <HI>False Friend,</HI> and the <HI>Rebel,</HI> remember'd, with Horror, their
past Crimes, and grew frantick, at every Thought, with the
Consciousness of what they had merited. They felt the se∣verest Pangs
of that most lively of all Torments, <HI>Despair</HI>; but the <HI>Just,</HI> and those who had the least to reproach them∣selves
with, found, yet, they had too much to answer for, when, in the Book of
Record, which was thrown open to the View of all, they perceived, that the
mi∣nutest of their Thoughts were registered.</P> 
<P>NOW we all became sensible, how easy the Rule was by which we
were to have <PB N="365" REF="374"/> liv'd; and how adapted to the required
Obedience of human Nature! Whilst we were thus lamenting our unhappy States,
and aggravating our Misery by Self-Con∣viction, in an Instant, we
discover'd a fiercer Blaze of Light, and beheld the my∣stick Veil drawn
off, that shrouded the Almighty's Presence: Raised on a Throne, to which
the Brightness of the Sun would have been dim, the Divine Father of all
Things disclos'd Himself; His Countenance was mildly aweful; Paternal
Tenderness shone out in every Feature of His Face, and dis∣covered a
Concern for us, which, we knew, proceeded from a Divine Idea, <HI>That if He
should be Merciful, He must be more than Just.</HI></P> 
<P>ON His Right Hand sat the <HI>Second Person,</HI> our known <HI>Redeemer</HI>; In Him, the Beauty of the Father was divinely manifested;
In Him, the Glory of His Power at once was soften'd, and exerted. Behind Him
the fatal Figure of that Cross, on which He suffer'd, hung, like a
dread∣ful Comet, prognosticating the Hour of Judgment. On the Left, was
placed the <HI>Third</HI> Adorable Person, in the, now, no longer <HI>Mystick Union.</HI> In Him, an equal Mixture of the Father, and the Son,
re∣veal'd itself, uniting, in his Countenance, the severest Glory of the

<P><PB N="366" REF="375"/> BENEATH, and on the Right of the World's
triumphant Saviour, sat his Twelve Disciples: Their Eyes were fix'd on
their great Master's Looks, and seem'd to borrow thence, by Reflection, all
their Softness, and their Lustre. In equal Sta∣tions, on the Left of the <HI>Holy Spirit,</HI> ap∣pear'd those Antient <HI>Philosophers,</HI> who,
through the Dusk of Superstition and Ido∣latry, by the Light of Reason, and
mere Nature, saw, and taught, One True, Eternal God; and in Defence of that

<P>WHILST I contemplated this Divine Appearance, I heard a Voice,

their Virtues and Obedience to the Divine Commands, concluding, that, though
they had ac∣quitted themselves, and were intitled, by the <HI>unalterable

they hop'd for, through the Mediation, the Merits, and the Blood of his beloved

were infi∣nite Numbers remaining) I observ'd, that they drew back,
reproaching each other, beating their Breasts, and making such Variety of
Lamentations, that the violent Noise awaken'd me, in such a Mixture of Joy,
and Horror, that it will be long be∣fore my Memory wears out the Impression
of so strong a Vision, which, if it affects you enough, to make you judge
it worth publishing, I shall have <HI>slept,</HI> as I love to <HI>wake,</HI> for the Service, or Warning of others.</P> </Q>

<HEAD TYPE="sub"><DATE>FRIDAY, <HI>August</HI> 21. 1724.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>I was visited, some Days ago, by several of my distinguish'd
Friends; and, on this Occasion, must particularly name the <HI>Major,</HI>
and <HI>Ned Volatile,</HI> in regard they were the principal Persons
concerned in that After∣noon's Conversation, which gave Birth to this Day's
Paper.</P>
<P>THE Discourse turn'd upon a Subject, to which a late unhappy
Rencounter furnish'd too many Materials: 'Twas the Dispute be∣tween Two
dear and inseparable Friends, which ended not, but with the Life of one of 
<PB N="369" REF="378"/> them. The Personal Acquaintance, that some of us had
with one, or both, of the Gen∣tlemen, continued our Conversation longer, and
carried our Reflections farther, than we should else have allow'd of, at a
Time, when we met to give, and receive a mutual Plea∣sure.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Point of Honour,</HI> which is usually the Foundation, upon
which these unhappy Dis∣putes are grounded, was, by the <HI>Major,</HI>
beau∣tifully explain'd, and set in a just Light, opposite to the too
generally mistaken Notions of that noble Qualification; and which <HI>Ned</HI> had too warmly debated, 'till <HI>Will. Weather∣cock</HI> diverted
his pushing it to Extremity, by the seasonable Interposition of his
peculiar Judgment. <HI>Will's</HI> Decisions, as the <HI>Pagans</HI> painted
their <HI>Janus,</HI> always appear with <HI>Two Faces,</HI> which favour both
Parties, and recon∣cile them in good Humour. Nevertheless, we could not leave
the Subject intirely, with∣out a Progress of Reflection upon the Fa∣tality of
sudden Startings, and ungovernable Passions, which are too much indulg'd,
and but too little provided against, by the Gene∣rality of Mankind.</P>
<P>I REMEMBER 'twas agreed to, that most of the ill Blood, Debates, and
Quarrels, that happen, owe their Original to Unconcern, and Carelesness
about our Humour in Conver∣sation. A Man must be Master of himself, and
preserve a watchful Guard over his Be∣haviour in Company, if he would either <HI>please,</HI> <PB N="370" REF="379"/> or be <HI>pleased.</HI> There is a
natural Liberty, which all Mankind claims by Right; but the mistaken Use of
it leads to Mischief. A li∣centious, or rambling, Tongue proves, as
in∣jurious to Society, as Treason to a State; and Traitors smart no more,
frequently, for <HI>This Guilt,</HI> than Prattlers for <HI>That
Folly.</HI></P>
<P><HI>NED VOLATILE,</HI> not yet quite cool, broke in upon our Chain of
Reasoning, by as∣serting, 
<Q REND="inline">'That a strict Watch over one's Words, Actions, and
Humour, in all Companies, is a Restraint, which, in his Opinion, dif∣fer'd
nothing from Torture. What! said he, must I be always under the Slavery of <HI>thinking</HI> before I speak? Shall I never have the Pleasure of
expressing my own Senti∣ments? Who would sacrifice his natural Rights, to
please another Man? Would any but a <HI>Fool,</HI> or <HI>Flatterer,</HI>
praise what he <HI>hates</HI>? or declare himself an Enemy to what he <HI>loves,</HI> merely to shew his <HI>good Humour,</HI> or <HI>Complaisance?</HI> No Gentlemen, I maintain, That <HI>Grandeur
itself,</HI> would be too dear bought at this Priee; and whoever affirms the
contrary, is no Friend to <HI>Plain-Dealing.</HI></Q></P>
<P>HE paus'd here, and look'd at me for Ap∣probation; I was going to
distinguish, and remark the Circumstances that should be punctually
regarded, when the <HI>Major</HI> begg'd to be heard. 
<Q REND="inline">'The Restraint, said he, that you represent so
dreadful, gives more Satis∣faction, than Pain. Your Complaisance, 
<PB N="371" REF="380"/> and good Humour, is more your own In∣terest, than
your, Companion's. Is it not for your own Sake, that you accommodate yourself
to his Humour, from whom you hope good Offices or expect agreeable
En∣terainment? Do you take for Dissimulation a Guard of Prudence, which
induces you to seem in the Sentiments of a Man, whom you would willingly draw
into yours, when either your Interest, or Inclination, requires it? For my
Part, I think you have a Right to applaud yourself, when you can enter
agreeably into opposite Humours: What induc'd all the Anticents to admire the
pliant Conduct of <HI>Alcibiades?</HI> And why do we <HI>still wonder,</HI>
that a Man could so aptly accommodate himself to the dif∣ferent Manners of
the several Countries where he liv'd? Nothing was so much talk'd of at <HI>Athens,</HI> as his <HI>Eloquence</HI> and <HI>Gallantry.</HI> Among the <HI>Persians,</HI> he was always <HI>feasting,</HI> and nothing was seen
more splendid, than his <HI>Dress</HI> and <HI>Equipage</HI>; but he
pass'd over to opposite Manners, when he was obliged to go to <HI>Sparta</HI>; for <HI>there</HI> the most rigid <HI>Lacedemonian</HI> led
a Life less <HI>austere</HI> than <HI>Alcibiades.</HI></Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'<HI>ALCIBIADES,</HI> cry'd <HI>Ned Volatile,</HI> was
an Affector of <HI>Popularity.</HI> His Maxim was like that of a Friend of
mine, <HI>Cum fueris Romae, Romano vivito More.</HI> But, hang it.—I hate
that Suppleness of Humour, It may be necessary for Embassadors and 
<PB N="372" REF="381"/> Travellers; but <HI>Ned Volatile</HI> has nothing to do
with it.</Q></P>
<P>HE was proceeding, in his usual Volubility of Speech, when I
interrupted him, in the following Manner.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'I AM sorry my Friend <HI>Volatile</HI> would de∣cry
one of the Blessings, upon which the Happiness of <HI>Society</HI> is in
a great Measure, founded. The Commerce of Life requires our Regard to Variety
of Humours every Day, and when <HI>Nature</HI> denies the Mastery, of them,
Men should endeavour to <HI>acquire</HI> it. Who would not <HI>rejoice
with</HI> a Friend, new∣ly, and happily, married? <HI>Congratulate one</HI>
just arrived from his Travels? Or <HI>Condole</HI> with <HI>another</HI> on
the Loss of an only, and valuable Son? This is no Suppleness, no Inequality
of Humour? 'Tis a Sweetness, 'tis a Virtue. Tell me; Would not your∣self,
in the Presence of a Gay Prince, de∣voted to his Pleasures, appear with a
chearful Countenance? Or, Would you accost with a smiling Air, a cloudy,
and suspicious, one? No more is it fitting to carry a Passi∣on into
Company disagreeable to that which reigns in it, or to discover a <HI>Mien</HI> which condemns the Sentiments wherewith the Company is
prepossessed. In short, no∣thing is more opposite to the Maxims of
Civil Society, than an Opinionative, and Dog∣matical, Conduct; and he who will
obstinate∣ly follow it, is in Danger of never getting new Friends, and even
of losing his old <PB N="373" REF="382"/> ones. I wish I could say, That
these Duels, and Deaths, we have been speaking of, are not its common
Consequences.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'I HAVE heard, and enter into your Senti∣ments with
Pleasure, said <HI>Ned Volatile</HI>; but allow me, at least, to affirm,
That one who is thus Master of his Temper, must never abuse this Power;
never betray his Senti∣ments, in maintaining an Error, or in giv∣ing Praises
to Words or Actions, that he is sensible do not deserve it.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'RIGHT, answered I.—<HI>How</HI> then, said
he, or <HI>wherein,</HI> do you appear Master of your Humour?—When I
submit it, replied I, to that of others, or decline my own Will to theirs, to
whom I would shew a Deference, my <HI>Words,</HI> at least, my <HI>Silence,</HI> should carry Tokens of my Complaisance. As for Example;
Did one whom I would not displease, commend an ill Man, not well known to
him? or who had wrong'd, or disoblig'd me? In such Case, I would stifle
and conceal my Resentment; and be silent, since I could not be of the
same Opinion with a Person whom I was unwilling to offend.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'NO, no cry'd, <HI>Ned Volatile,</HI> if ever I
sub∣ject my Humour, it shall be to the <HI>Ladies</HI>; There are many <HI>Capricio's,</HI> that must be borne with, from them; but, in all other
Cases, <HI>my Mind is my Kingdom; I am absolute, and will be
so.</HI>'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="374" REF="383"/>HE ran on, to this Purpose, near a Quar∣ter of
an Hour; and, at last, happening to touch again on the Article of Honour and
Friendship, which had introduc'd the Subject of our Discourse, the <HI>Major</HI> requested him to hear a Story, in which, an <HI>Example</HI>
of both these valuable Distinctions would better plead for their right
Use, than any Account he could give of <HI>his own particular Sense</HI> of
them. The Story, said the <HI>Major,</HI> is Modern; but not well known; and
amongst all the Instances of Bravery, is a fine, and uncommon Display of
it. 'Tis what most <HI>Fighters</HI> would think below them, yet, what none,
but a Con∣queror, could come up to.</P>
<P><HI>ALTAMONT,</HI> and <HI>Honorius,</HI> were both Men of Quality,
and of Eminence in the Army, wherein they had served long in Friendship
together. <HI>Altamont</HI> was, deservedly, placed in the full Height of
Power and Preferment: <HI>Honorius,</HI> inferior but a small Degree in
Post, was greatly so in Fortune; but he was fill'd with Princely Virtues,
and his Soul had a distinguish'd Greatness: He had been a Sharer in the
whole Course of <HI>Altamont</HI>'s innumerable
Glories.—<HI>Honorius,</HI> on some after-Occasion, whether, as
suppos'd, by <HI>Altamont</HI>'s Breach of Promise, or what other Ground
for Resent∣ment happened, is neither known, nor mate∣rial to be debated; 'tis
sufficient to tell you, That <HI>Honorius</HI> was so disoblig'd, that he
sent <HI>Altamont</HI> a Challenge, to determine their Difference, in a Duel,
at a Time appointed, in <HI>Hyde-Park.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="375" REF="384"/>AT the Time in which <HI>Altamont</HI> received
this Challenge, he was soo deeply ingaged in a Trust, whereon depended the
Preservation of the King's Person and Government, that he could not
sacrifice, or neglect them, by risquing his important Life, in a Personal
Quarrel, at that Juncture; but knowing well the Honour and Bravery of <HI>Honorius,</HI> and jealous too of his own, he sent for <HI>Carolinus</HI>
early that Morning, in which he was to fight.—
<Q REND="inline">'<HI>Brother,</HI> said he, You know how much of the
Weight of Government lies at this Time upon my Shoulders, and there are some
secret Concerns of State, to which you are yet a Stranger. I am called upon
to a <HI>Duel</HI>: It concerns a Case of <HI>Honour,</HI> and my Adversary
is a Man of Bravery. <HI>You</HI> must meet him, in my Stead, and give him
the Satisfaction he requires.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>CAROLINUS,</HI> resolved to act in his Brother's Cause, as in
his own, without Delay, went to meet his unknown Opponent; but when he arrived
at the destin'd Spot, he was con∣founded, to see him the <HI>dearest
Friend he had upon Earth!</HI> 
<Q REND="inline">'Good God! said <HI>Honorius,</HI> to what am I
fated? I expected your <HI>Brother,</HI> and is it <HI>You,</HI> my <HI>Carolinus!</HI>'</Q> <HI>It is,</HI> replied <HI>Carolinus,</HI> with a
Sigh! They gaz'd on each other; their Breasts were agitated by a Tem∣pest
of warring Passions!—After a Length of silent Confusion, <HI>Honorius</HI> thus addressed himself to <HI>Carolinus</HI>—
<Q REND="inline">'You are that very Friend, I ever called, and thought 
<PB N="376" REF="385"/> you; You are the Man who have so often vow'd the
most sincere, and exalted Friend∣ship for me.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'I am, replied <HI>Carolinus,</HI> and I bring with me
the same devoted Heart, a Sacrifice to your Disposal! If you survive,
you will know my Innocence, and the Cause why I am here, which weighty
Reasons forbid the Discovery of at present; But come—<HI>Since it
must be thus</HI>'</Q>—They both advanc'd, and in that Instant, <HI>Honorius</HI> cry'd, <HI>Hold my</HI> Carolinus! <HI>'Tis done! The
Struggle of my Soul is over, and our Dis∣pute at an End. I am determin'd! I
will not, I cannot break the Chain that has bound our Souls so long together;
no, not for your Bro∣ther's Power, or my Prince's Crown.</HI>—They
continued some Time in Disorder and Expo∣stulation. Both of them were
brave, sove∣reignly brave! and none ever lived, who better knew what Honour
was, or could de∣fend it more nobly!</P>
<P><HI>HONORIUS</HI> went on;—
<Q REND="inline">'Well, my Friend, 'till now, I never felt Extre∣mity.
Your Brother, who has done me Wrong, ought to give me Satisfaction, and were he
here, I could not sheath my Sword unsatisfied; but you are my <HI>Friend,</HI> with whom <HI>I can have no Difference.</HI> I would die a
Thousand Deaths to <HI>save,</HI> or to <HI>serve</HI> you; and I will
put the greatest Force up∣on my Nature, and even <HI>ask Pardon</HI> of the
Man who has <HI>injur'd</HI> me, rather than ha∣zard a Life, so much more
precious than <PB N="377" REF="386"/> my own. But, let us leave this Place with
Speed; I'll give up my Resentment. Let your Brother, let the World, treat my
Conduct, at their Pleasure: There is no∣thing, but my Hopes of Heaven, that I
would not hazard for my <HI>Carolinus:</HI></Q>—He went, and did as he
said; and whatever Constructions the World might put upon <HI>Altamont</HI>'s Behaviour, and <HI>Honorius</HI>'s Con∣deseension, a
noble Example was here gi∣ven of the most generous, and exalted,
Friendship; and of that absolute <HI>Self-Conquest,</HI> which <HI>Solomon,</HI> the wisest of all Men, prefers to the <HI>Conquering of a
City.</HI></P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub"><DATE>MONDAY, <HI>August</HI> 24. 1724.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>I DEDICATE this Paper to the Ladies; for I design it as a Lesson
of <HI>Love:</HI> which a certain perverse Foreigner, will have to be no more
than a Phantom; <HI>Because</HI> says he, <HI>Like an Apparition, Every
Body has heard of, but No-body has seen it.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="378" REF="387"/>IT is much easier, indeed, <HI>to love,</HI>
than to explain <HI>what Love is</HI>; For it is one, among the <HI>Paradoxes</HI> of that ungovernable Passion, that it strikes the
Tongue <HI>dumb</HI>; but makes every other Part of the Body <HI>eloquent.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Major,</HI> to please <HI>Ned Volatile,</HI> has indulg'd
him the Perusal of that PICTURE OF LOVE, from which he recited the Verses,
in my XXXIVth Paper.—I had the Mis∣fortune to be present, and to hear
him read it over. I call it a <HI>Misfortune,</HI> because my Passion for
that wild <HI>Insensible,</HI> my Coquet, who is rambled away to <HI>Tunbridge,</HI> was half suppress'd before, for want of Occasion to
in∣flame it; but has rekindled itself, at the Fire which it catch'd from this
unlucky Picture; and I, now, bleed afresh, like a dead Body, at the Touch of
its Murderer.</P>
<P>YET, why do I complain, that I am sen∣sible of a generous
Passion, which, to lay aside the Pride of Wisdom, and the Forma∣lity of
Age, and Gravity, he who is insensi∣ble of, is <HI>stupid?</HI>—The
Philosopher de∣fin'd Love prettily, when he said, It was a <HI>Circle,</HI>
returning <HI>through</HI> Happiness, <HI>to</HI> Happiness, <HI>from</HI>
Happiness. The Emblem was ingenious, and the Lover's <HI>Ring</HI> is a
pro∣per, and significant, Allusion to it.</P>
<P>I AM so far, when I think <HI>seriously,</HI> from being
asham'd to be call'd a <HI>Lover,</HI> that I am, sincerely, of Opinion,
that whoever has not lov'd, has put his Virtues to no Tryal.—Love is the
Breeze of Life: A healthful, <PB N="379" REF="388"/> and refreshing, <HI>Gale,</HI> which, by its Agitation of the Spirits, keeps our Faculties in
lively Motion; so, as neither to stagnate, in un∣fruitful Rest, nor drive
tempestuously, with the most stormy Passions.—The Heart of a
Lover is impress'd with Sweetness, and Humanity. His Soul receives
Extension, beyond its natural Power; and is as much more refin'd, than a <HI>selfish,</HI> common, Soul, as that Soul, which it so excels, is
above the Body it belongs to.</P>
<P>THERE is something, in Love, that is stronger than <HI>Calamity,</HI> and more gentle than <HI>Pity!</HI> serener than <HI>Silence,</HI> more splendid than <HI>Riches,</HI> and statelier than <HI>Honour!</HI> More trembling than <HI>Fear,</HI> and more charming than <HI>Pleasure</HI>! It is, even more powerful than <HI>Conscience:</HI> For
whom we love, we imagine, always, <HI>present,</HI> and passing Judg∣ment
on our most secret Purposes. We re∣gulate them, therefore, according to
our Apprehension of what She would <HI>approve,</HI> or <HI>condemn</HI>;
and, so, supply ourselves with a constant Vigilance, and Propensity
to noble Actions.</P>
<P>IN some Sense, he who <HI>loves,</HI> may be said to be <HI>like
a God</HI>; for he has but one, Care, and <HI>That,</HI> a Great, and a
Heavenly, One! He is, wholly, intent upon <HI>Beneficence.</HI>—He has
the Prophet's sacred Privilege, to be rapp'd, out of himself! To enjoy
per∣petual Ecstacy! To be emptied of his own Soul, that he may be animated by
one, <PB N="380" REF="389"/> more dear to him!—Our Ideas of the Joys of <HI>Heaven,</HI> can represent them no other, than that we are, there, to <HI>love,</HI> and to <HI>be beloved</HI>: And they, who love, here on Earth,
are <HI>above</HI> the World, while they are <HI>in it.</HI> Nor can <HI>Death</HI> disunite Lovers so in∣tirely as it does other People,
since <HI>Love</HI> dies not, with the <HI>Object lov'd.</HI> She lives, so
te∣naciously, in our charm'd, and retentive, <HI>Memory,</HI> that her Death
seems no more, than a long, and lamented, Absence, ra∣ther indearing, than
defacing, her Image.—So that <HI>This</HI> is the only Difference, which
Death seems capable of making, when he interposes between <HI>Lovers</HI>;—While both <HI>liv'd,</HI> their <HI>Two Bodies</HI> had
no more than <HI>One Soul:</HI> And, now one is <HI>dead,</HI> their <HI>Two
Souls</HI> hove no more than <HI>One Body.</HI></P>
<P>NEITHER has <HI>Age,</HI> that alters all Things, a Power to deface
our <HI>Love</HI>; for, whom we love, can never seem Old. Our Remem∣brance
presents her Beauty everlastingly in its Spring: And her Idea is retain'd
inchanting∣ly, in the very Attitude, which, first, she struck us by.</P>
<P>THE restless, but unwearied, Lover, seeks for himself, <HI>out
of himself</HI>: Let him gaze, touch, listen, and be bless'd, for ever,
yet, still, he <HI>longs,</HI> and is unsatisfied!—There is a
Dropsy, in his Mind, and his Thirst augments, with drinking.—His Soul
is either not at home, or in a starting, and im∣patient Posture.—If
he presses his <PB N="381" REF="390"/> Charmer's Hand, it darts, with
Violence, into his <HI>Fingers.</HI> If he leans at her lov'd Side, it beats
against his <HI>Breast,</HI> as if it would break its Prison, to be <HI>nearer</HI> her. When she speaks, it is in his <HI>Ear:</HI> When he
looks on her, it is in his <HI>Eye:</HI> But, he has <HI>no Soul at all,</HI>
when she is absent.</P>
<Q> 
<LG>
<L>Absent from her, in whom, alone, we live,</L>
<L>Life grows a <HI>Bankrupt,</HI> and no Bliss can give:</L>
<L>Friends are importunate, and Pleasures lost;</L>
<L>What, once, most charm'd us, now, disgusts us, most!</L>
<L>Fretful, to silent Solitudes we run,</L>
<L>And Men, and Light, and noisy Converse, shun.</L>
<L>Pensive, in Woods, on Rivers Sides, we walk,</L>
<L>And to th' unlistning Winds, and Waters, talk.</L>
<L>How, next, we shall approach her, pleas'd, we weigh!</L>
<L>And <HI>think,</HI> in Transport, All, we mean to say.</L>
<L>Tenderly bowing, <HI>Thus</HI> will we complain;</L>
<L><HI>Thus,</HI> court her Pity; And, <HI>Thus,</HI> plead our
Pain.</L>
<L><HI>Thus,</HI> sigh, for fancied Frowns, if Frowns shou'd
rise,</L>
<L>And <HI>Thus,</HI> meet Favours, in her softning Eyes.</L>
<L>Restless, on Paper, we our Vows repeat,</L>
<L>And pour our <HI>Souls</HI> out, on the letter'd Sheet.</L>
<L>Write, blot, restore, and in lost Pieces, rend</L>
<L>The <HI>Mute Entreaters;</HI> yet, too faint, to send.</L>
</LG> 
<LG>
<L>Unbless'd, when no Admission we procure,</L>
<L>'Tis Heav'n, at Distance, to discern her Door.</L>
<L><PB N="382" REF="391"/>Or, to her Window, we, by Night repair;</L>
<L>And let loose Fancy, to be feasted, there.</L>
<L>Watch her lov'd Shadow, as it glances by:</L>
<L>And, to imagin'd Motions, chain our Eye.</L>
<L>Has she some Field, or Grove, or Garden, bless'd?</L>
<L>Pleas'd, we retread the Paths her Feet have press'd.</L>
<L>Near her, by Chance, at Visits, or at Plays,</L>
<L>Our rushing Spirits croud, in <HI>speaking Gaze,</HI></L>
<L>Light, on her varied Airs, our Eye-balls ride,</L>
<L>Dark, as the Dead, to the full World, beside.</L>
</LG></Q>
<P>LOVERS converse, like Angels, by a kind of <HI>Intuition</HI>! They <HI>hear</HI> one another's <HI>Souls</HI>; and prevent each other's <HI>Wishes.</HI>—Like Divinities quitting their Shrines, they disrobe
themselves of their <HI>Bodies</HI>; and intermingle their meeting <HI>Minds,</HI> as we see Two <HI>Lights</HI> incorporate.—Their Souls
glide out, from their Eyes, to snatch Embraces, at a Di∣stance; and return,
inrich'd, with the fan∣cy'd Treasure.—There is more Harmony, in Love,
than in Musick: A Harmony! like that which the old Philosophers imputed to
the Spheres! Only Two Spheres are <HI>acted</HI>; by one, and the same, <HI>Intelligence.</HI> For the Strings of Two Hearts sympathize, like those
of Two Lutes, with correspondent Trepida∣tions.</P>
<P>HOW mistaken are they, who call Love an <HI>idle</HI>
Passion!—<HI>Thought</HI> itself is scarce more active. There is
an unsatisfied, and continual Thirst, in the Appetite of a Lover: 
<PB N="383" REF="392"/> A constant Spring, in his Delights, and Tor∣ments. He
pursues his Discoveries, with a restless, and impatient, Vigour: And,
tho' like the shining, heavenly, Bodies, he is, everlastingly, in Motion,
yet, he is so far from becoming weary, that he is rather refresh'd, by his
Labour.</P>
<P>I WILL copy, yet farther, from the Pi∣cture abomentioned, the
following <HI>Group,</HI> or Assembly, of the <HI>Symptoms, Moles,</HI> and <HI>To∣kens</HI> of this Passion.—It is upon the Lover's first
Approach to his Mistress's Person: We recover, slowly, from our sweet
Surprize, says this <HI>Doctor</HI> of <HI>Cupid</HI>'s-<HI>College,</HI>
and, ad∣vancing, with a blushful Tenderness, 
<Q> 
<LG>
<L>Bowing, we kneel; and her giv'n Hand is press'd,</L>
<L>With sweet Compulsion, to our beating Breast:</L>
<L>O'er it, in Ecstacy, our Lips bend low,</L>
<L>And Tides of Sighs, 'twixt her grasp'd Fingers, flow.</L>
<L>High beats the hurried Pulse, at each, forc'd, Kiss:</L>
<L>And ev'ry burning Sinew <HI>akes,</HI> with <HI>Bliss:</HI></L>
<L>Life, in a <HI>Souly Deluge,</HI> rushes o'er;</L>
<L>And the charm'd Heart springs out, at ev'ry Pore!</L>
</LG> 
<LG>
<L>The first fierce Raptures, of Amazement, past,</L>
<L>Confusion quits us, and Desire grows, fast.</L>
<L>We sit: And, while her gaz'd at Wonders rise,</L>
<L>A humid Brightness fills our sparkling Eyes:</L>
<L>Modest Disquiet, every Action wears;</L>
<L>And each, long Look, the Mark of Passion bears.</L>
<L><PB N="384" REF="393"/>Disorder'd Nature, no cold <HI>Medium</HI> keeps;</L>
<L>Transport, now, reigns, and dull Reflection sleeps.</L>
<L>All, that we wish, or feel, or act, or say,</L>
<L>Is above <HI>Thought,</HI> and out of <HI>Reason's</HI>
Way!</L>
<L>Joy murmurs, Anger laughs, and Hope looks sad:</L>
<L>Rashness grows prudent, and Discretion mad.</L>
<L>Restless, we feel our am'rous Bosom burn:</L>
<L>Now, This Way <HI>look</HI> we; And, now, That Way, <HI>turn.</HI></L>
<L>Now, in sweet <HI>Swell</HI> of Thought, our lifted Eyes</L>
<L>Lose their low Languor, and attempt to rise:</L>
<L>Now, sinking, suppliant, seek the Charmer's Feet;</L>
<L>And court wish'd Pity, in their glanc'd Retreat.</L>
<L>Oft, in full Gaze, they <HI>dwell</HI> upon her Face;</L>
<L>Then, start, astonish'd, from some dazling Grace.</L>
<L>Now, in bold Liberty, fly out, unbid:</L>
<L>Now, aw'd, 'scape, inward, 'twixt the closing Lid.</L>
</LG> 
<LG>
<L>If we dare <HI>speak,</HI> and wou'd our Wish pursue,</L>
<L>The Words fall, feath'ry, like descending Dew,</L>
<L>The soft'ning Accents, ev'n in Utt'rance, die:</L>
<L>And the <HI>Tongue</HI>'s Sweetness, here, outcharms the <HI>Eye.</HI></L>
<L>'Till mingled Sighs our fainting Voice confound:</L>
<L>But Lovers Meanings <HI>speak,</HI> though robb'd of <HI>Sound.</HI></L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>I AM fond of thinking we might draw, from Love, a Proof of the <HI>Soul's Immortality:</HI> What, else, mean our Desires, when they
ex∣tend themselves, beyond the utmost, that willing Nature can indulge us
in.—Why, else, are the Joys of Love mix'd with me∣lancholy, 
<PB N="385" REF="394"/> and unsatisfied Tremblings?—They increase,
indeed, and refine, the Plea∣sure: But they convince us, That there <HI>is</HI> a Union, more adapted to our Mind's free Es∣sence; and, which,
Bodies are not <HI>fine</HI> enough to permit them the Enjoyment of.</P>
<P>HENCE, that exquisite <HI>Expansion!</HI> That <HI>Liquefaction,</HI> of the Heart! when it refuses to allow us the
Possession of our dearest Wish, in the very Moment we become
Masters of it! The subtle Workings of this exalted Pas∣sion, upon the
Refinements of our Mind, have <HI>Deified</HI> the beloved Object, 'till we
faint, with Awe, when we should receive her Ten∣derness: And, by a
fantastical kind of Envy, consider ourselves, as our own
Rivals!—The <HI>supremest Joy</HI> of Love must, if Men will have
it so, be <HI>call'd Bodily:</HI> But All, that heightens it, to be worth the
Wish of a wise Man, it must be indebted to the <HI>Mind</HI>
for.—Whence could Images so <HI>warm,</HI> as these which follow,
receive a Purity, in their Expression, that adapts them to the chastest
Ear, if the <HI>Mind</HI>'s Part were not strongest, even where the <HI>Body</HI> pretends most Influence?</P>
<Q> 
<L>Is there no more? Oh! yet the <HI>Last</HI> remains!</L> 
<L>Crown of our Conquest! Sweetner of our Pains!</L> 
<L>There <HI>is a Time,</HI> when Love no Wish denies:</L> 
<L>And smiling Nature throws off All Disguise.</L> 
<L>But, who can <HI>Words,</HI> to speak those Raptures, find?</L> 
<L>Vast <HI>Sea of Ecstacy,</HI> that drowns the Mind!</L> 
<L><PB N="386" REF="395"/>That fierce Transfusion of <HI>exchanging</HI> Hearts!</L> 
<L>That gliding Glimpse of Heav'n, in pulsive Starts?</L> 
<L>That <HI>veiny Rush!</HI> That warm, tumultuous, <HI>Roll!</HI></L> 
<L>That Fire that kindles <HI>Bodies</HI> into <HI>Soul!</HI></L> 
<L>And, on Life's <HI>Margin,</HI> strains Delight, so high,</L> 
<L>That <HI>Sense</HI> breaks short—and, while we <HI>taste,</HI> we <HI>die!</HI></L> </Q>
<P>BUT, I am going, I know not whither. The Painter of this <HI>Picture</HI> has bewitch'd me, from my Purpose; which was to have enter'd
upon a <HI>Philosophical</HI> Dissertation, concerning the <HI>Qualities</HI> of Love: Instead of which, I am rambling into a <HI>natural</HI> one, upon the <HI>Effects</HI> of it!</P>

<P>IN my XXXVIth Paper, I published some Remarks on an excellent Old
Bal∣lad, called WILLIAM, and MARGARET. I was charm'd with the Strength, and
Beau∣ties, of its masculine Simplicity: and, really, took it to <HI>be,</HI>
what it <HI>appear'd,</HI> The Work of some Old Poet, long since <HI>dead</HI>; but I have been agreeably undeceiv'd: The Author of it is alive,
and a <HI>North-Briton</HI>; I congratulate his Country, on the Promise of
this rising Genius: For the Gentleman, it seems, is ve∣ry young, and
received his Education in the University of <HI>Edinburgh.</HI></P>
<P>AMONG many fine Qualities, which adorn him, he is so unconscious
of his own Merit, or possesses it with so sincere a Modesty, that
he declines being publickly nam'd: But, as he <PB N="388" REF="397"/> has
oblig'd me with a Letter, containing the short History of an unhappy
Accident, which gave Occasion to his Ballad, it will be an agreeable
Entertainment if I publish it, as the Author sent it me.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR PLAIN DEALER, of <HI>July</HI> the 24th, was sent to me by a
Friend. I must own, after I had read it over, I was both surpriz'd and
pleas'd to find, that a simple Tale of my Writing, had merited the Notice,
and Approbation, of the Au∣thor of the PLAIN DEALER.</P>
<P>AFTER what you have said, of WILLIAM and MARGARET, I flatter
myself, that you will not be displeas'd with an Account of the Accident
which gave Birth to that Ballad.</P>
<P>YOUR Conjecture, that it was founded on the real History of an
unhappy Woman, is true—A vain, young, Gentleman, had, for some Time,
professed Love to a Lady, then in the Spring of her Life, and Beauty. He
dress'd well, talk'd loud, and spoke Nonsense, with <HI>Spirit:</HI>
She had good Understanding; but was too young to know the World. I have
seen her, very often. There was a lively Innocence in her Look. She had never
been address'd to by a Man of <HI>Sense:</HI> And, therefore, knew not how
despicable, and unsincere, a <HI>Fool</HI> is. In time, he persuaded her,
that there was <PB N="389" REF="398"/> Merit in his Passion.—She
believ'd him, and was <HI>undone.</HI></P>
<P>SHE was upon the Point of bringing in∣to the World the Effect of her
ill-plac'd Love, before her Father knew the Misfor∣tune. Judge the Sentiments
of the good Old Man! yet his Affection outweighed his Anger. He could not think
of aban∣doning his Child, to Want, and Infamy. He applied himself to her
false Lover, with an Offer of Half his Fortune; But the Temper of the
Betrayer was savag'd, with cruel Inso∣lence. He rejected the Father's
Offers, and re∣proach'd the Innocence he had ruin'd, with the Bitterness of
open Scorn. The News was brought her, when in a weak Condi∣tion, and cast her
into a Fever. And, in a few Days after, I saw her, and her Child, laid in one
Grave, together.</P>
<P>IT was some Time after this, That I chanc'd to look into a Comedy
of <HI>Fletcher</HI>'s, called, <HI>The Knight of the burning Pestle.</HI>
The Place I fell upon was, where old <HI>Mer∣ry-Thought</HI> repeats these
Verses; 
<Q> 
<L>When it was grown to dark Midnight,</L> 
<L>And all were fast asleep:</L> 
<L>In came <HI>Margaret</HI>'s grimly Ghost,</L> 
<L>And stood at <HI>William</HI>'s Feet.</L> </Q> </P>
<P>WHICH, I fancy, was the Beginning of some Ballad, commonly known,
at the Time, when this Author wrote.—These <PB N="390" REF="399"/>
Lines, naked of Ornament, and simple, as they are, struck my Fancy; I
clos'd the Book, and bethought myself, that the un∣happy Adventure, I have
mentioned above, which then came fresh into my Mind, might naturally raise
a Tale, upon the Appearance of this Ghost.—It was, then, Midnight. All,
round me, was still, and quiet. These concurring Circumstances work'd my
Soul to a powerful Melancholy. I could not sleep. And, at that Time, I
finish'd my little Poem, such as you see it here. If it continues still
to deserve your Approbation, I have my Aim; and am,</P>
<CLOSER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE> 
<SIGNED>Your most Obliged, And most humble Servant, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>IT <HI>does,</HI> most justly, continue to deserve, and will, <HI>for ever,</HI> deserve, not only Ap∣probation, but the Applause, of all
true Judges of Wit, and Nature. The Author's Copy, which he inclos'd to me, is
different in several Places, from that which fell into my Hands; but the
Sense of both, is exactly the same; and the Variation, in some
Ex∣pressions, not considerable enough to make it necessary to
republish that excellent Ballad.</P>
<P><PB N="391" REF="400"/>HAVING this Occasion to speak of <HI>Scot∣land,</HI> I judge it the properest Place to insert my
Acknowledgment of a Letter from <HI>Edin∣burgh,</HI> sign'd <HI>Fergus

<P>THE first PLAIN DEALER, that came to my Hand, was that, where∣in
you represent, in true Colours, the Character, and Conduct, of the present
Emperor of <HI>Russia,</HI> with Regard to his Son, Prince <HI>Alexei.</HI>—My Fancy was charm'd, and my Judgment intirely
satisfied, with the Account you gave: Our Coffee-Houses take in your
Papers, and I observe, with Pleasure, the Welcome which our politest
People receive them with. Not the Men alone, of all Ranks, but the Ladies
also, make them their Entertainment. The ge∣neral Conversation of both
Sexes turns, on the Matter you afford.</P>
<P>I CANNOT help writing to you, that I may let you know your
Influence. It must <PB N="392" REF="401"/> be a Pleasure to your generous

</LETTER>
<P>I CANNOT forbear confessing, that I shall expect, with a very
sensible Pleasure, the Event of this Northern Correspondence: For I
have retain'd, from my Infancy a kind <PB N="393" REF="402"/> of affectionate
Partiality, for the generous Bravery, and gallant Plainness, of our
Bro∣thers, beyond <HI>Tweed.</HI> When I travell'd, in my Youth, I scarce
ever saw a Court, even in the remotest Parts of the civiliz'd World, where
some Gentleman, or other, a <HI>Scot,</HI> by Birth, or Descent, was not,
one, of its noblest Ornaments: And, now, since the <HI>Muses,</HI> and
the <HI>Graces,</HI> have, very visibly, from the Begin∣ning of the present
Century, fix'd, and seated themselves, in their learned Seminaries, their
rising Youth, of both Sexes, seem to vie, with one another, in a warm, and
generous, Emulation which shall most adorn their own, or soonest match
the Elegance, of other, even the po∣litest, Nations.</P>
<P>NOT the Gentlemen alone, but the very Ladies, of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI>
form themselves into select, and voluntary, <HI>Societies,</HI> for the
Im∣provement of their Knowledge, instead of the Entertainment of their Fancy:
And go on, at the same Time, to refine their Conversa∣tion, inrich their
Understanding, and polish, and render amiable, their Personal
Deport∣ment.</P>
<P>I SHALL, in the Course of my Observa∣tions, take Occasion to
demonstrate the Truth of this Remark, by a Variety of Particulars; which,
while they are doing Justice to the <HI>North,</HI> will contribute, in no
small Degree, to the Pleasure of the <HI>South</HI> Part of this King∣dom.
At present, I shall produce but Two Instances: And the First is, A
Society of <PB N="394" REF="403"/> Young Gentlemen, most, if not all of them,
Students in the University of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> who from a Sympathy of
Affections, found∣ded on a Similitude of <HI>Parts,</HI> and <HI>Genius,</HI>
have united themselves into a Body, under Title of THE GROTESQUE CLUB; the
Reason of which Name, I shall explain in a future Paper. Their
Business, to express it in the Words of one of their own Members, is, <HI>A Friendship that knows no Strife, but that of a generous Emulation, to
excell, in Virtue, Learn∣ing, and Politeness.</HI></P>
<P>TO how surprizing a Degree these fine Spirits have succeeded, in
their noble <HI>End,</HI> let the following Sentiments declare; conceiv'd, and
express'd, with all the Clearness, Depth, and Strength, of an <HI>experienc'd Philosopher,</HI> by a Member of this <HI>Grotesque
Club,</HI> who was in his <HI>Fourteenth Year only,</HI> when he compos'd, in
Blank Verse, a Poem, now in my Hands; and founded on a Supposition of the
Author's sitting, a whole Summer Night, in a Gar∣den, looking upward, and
quite losing him∣self, in Contemplation on <HI>the Works, and Wonders, of
Almighty Power.</HI>—If this was a Subject, naturally above the Capacity
of so very a Boy, to what a Degree does it in∣crease our Wonder, when we
find it treated, in this Masterly Manner!</P>
<Q> 
<LG>
<L>Now, I survey'd my native Faculties:</L>
<L>And trac'd my Actions to their teeming Source.</L>
<L>Now, I explor'd the universal Frame;</L>
<L>Gaz'd Nature through, and, with interior Light,</L>
<L><PB N="395" REF="404"/>Convers'd with Angels, and unbody'd
Saints,</L>
<L>That tread the Courts of the <HI>Eternal King!</HI></L>
<L>Gladly, I would declare, in lofty Strains,</L>
<L>The Power of <HI>Godhead,</HI> to the Sons of Men.</L>
<L>But Thought is <HI>lost,</HI> in its Immensity!</L>
<L>Imagination wastes its Strength in vain:</L>
<L>And Fancy <HI>tires,</HI> and <HI>turns</HI> within itself,</L>
<L>Struck, with th'amazing <HI>Depths</HI> of <HI>Deity!</HI></L>
<L>—Ah! my lov'd God! in vain, a tender Youth,</L>
<L>Unskill'd, in Arts of deep Philosophy,</L>
<L>Attempts to search the bulky Mass of <HI>Matter:</HI></L>
<L>To trace the Rules of <HI>Motion:</HI> and pursue</L>
<L>The Phantom <HI>Time,</HI> too subtle, for his Grasp!</L>
<L>Yet may I, from thy most <HI>apparent Works,</HI></L>
<L>Form some Idea of their wondrous Author;</L>
<L>And celebrate <HI>thy Praise,</HI> with rapt'rous Mind.</L>
</LG> 
<LG>
<L>How can I gaze upon yon <HI>sparkling Vault,</HI></L>
<L>And view the <HI>Planets,</HI> rolling in their Spheres,</L>
<L>Yet be an <HI>Atheist!</HI>—Can I see those <HI>Stars,</HI></L>
<L>And <HI>think</HI> of others, far beyond my Ken,</L>
<L>Yet want Conviction of creating Power?</L>
<L>What, but a Being, of immense Perfection,</L>
<L>Cou'd, through unbounded Spaces, thus, dispose</L>
<L>Suth num'rous Bodies, All, presumptive <HI>Worlds?</HI></L>
<L>The undesigning Hand of giddy <HI>Chance,</HI></L>
<L>Cou'd never fill, with Globes, so vast! so bright!</L>
<L>That lofty Conclave!—</L>
</LG> 
<LG>
<L>Where shall I trace the <HI>Sources</HI> of the <HI>Light?</HI></L>
<L>What Seats assign to th' Element of <HI>Fire,</HI></L>
<L>That, unconfin'd, thro' all the <HI>Systems,</HI> breaks!</L>
<L>Here, cou'd I lie, in Contemplation wrapt,</L>
<L><PB N="396" REF="405"/>And pass, with Pleasure, an eternal
Age!</L>
<L>But, 'tis too much for my weak Mind to know:</L>
<L>Teach me, with humble Reverence to <HI>adore</HI></L>
<L>The Mysteries, I <HI>must not comprehend!</HI></L>
</LG></Q>
<P>LET this <HI>prodigious Young Man,</HI> bear the Blame, of my not
having left myself Room in this Paper, to pay that Respect, which I
intended, to THE FAIR INTELLECTUALS: A Club of Ladies, at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI>
who set a Pattern to <HI>Female Excellence:</HI> And whose <HI>His∣tory,
Rules,</HI> and <HI>Constitutions,</HI> I have the Pleasure to see,
before me, with the conventual Address of <HI>Mistress Speaker,</HI> to
the lovely <HI>Sisterhood</HI>; and the <HI>admissory Speech,</HI> of one
of the Ladies; as set forth by the able Pen of <HI>Mistress
Secretary.</HI>—I shall say more, on a future Occasion, of the
Honour done to the whole Sex, by the dangerous Ambition of these Ladies: And
of the Political Necessity, which, I conceive, there will soon be, of
putting a Stop to the Progress of such un∣limitted Improvement of a Power,
already too exorbitant!</P>

<P>I HAVE endeavour'd to shew, in a for∣mer Paper, that Parents are
highly to blame, when they force their Children to marry for the Sake of a
Fortune which can never repair the least of those innumerable Mischiefs,
that are inseparably annexed to it. Using Authority in such a Case,
turns the most Indulgent of Fathers, into an insupport∣able Tyrant, who by
one inconsiderate De∣cree, that is irreversible, dooms his own Child to the
most doleful Imprisonment for Life. The following Epistle, gives us so
sad, but so lively a Representation of this Truth, that I insert it for
the Sake of those, who might, possibly, be betrayed, in their Conduct, to
give the same fatal Proofs of their Affection to their Off-spring, that
seem to <HI>Edge</HI> all the Sufferings of our present Complainant.</P>
<LETTER>
<PB N="398" REF="407"/>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM a Young Man, about Three and Twenty, that much against my
Will, have complied with the incessant Importu∣nities of my Friends; or,
rather, obey'd the absolute Commands of an indulgent Father, and a fond
Mother, in marrying a very Rich Maid of about Thirty Six, who, it seems, is
only mine, because several Sui∣ters of equal Pretensions in Wealth with
herself, that liked her Person, left her, as soon as they had conversed
with her suffici∣ently to sound her Temper.</P>
<P>BEFORE I married her, I enjoyed Health, and good Humour, and thought
my For∣tune good enough as it was, and abundant∣ly sufficient, with a Female
Companion that brought the like Ingredients towards it, to make Life tolerably
happy.</P>
<P>SHE has not been my Wife, quite a Year, and yet has managed her Time
so well, that she has robb'd me of all my Quiet. The natural Gayety of my
Disposition is sowr'd, almost enough to make me think of grow∣ing her
Torturer, as she is mine: The Flo∣ridness of Health has left me; and I am
overcome by an inward Pining, that wastes me outwardly: In fine, she has
convinced me, that a Man may be emphatically Poor in the Affluence of Wealth,
and truly, and properly said to Want, amidst the Abun∣dance of all
Things.</P>
<P><PB N="399" REF="408"/> I HAVE industriously studied to shew
Gratitude, and true Friendship. For I really had an Intention to render
my∣self as agreeable as possible; and the more, because, during the
Time of our <HI>modish</HI> Courtship, she had told those, from whom I
should hear it again, that she lik'd me: By this <HI>habitual Art</HI> of <HI>Tender∣ness,</HI> I almost brought it to be <HI>Natural,</HI> and began
to deceive myself into an Opini∣on, that I should not be incapable of even <HI>loving</HI> her at last. She, in Return, began, after a manner <HI>then</HI> perfectly unaccountable, to do every Thing, not only that she
thought would disoblige me, but that she knew would be a sincere
Affliction to me. I find <HI>since,</HI> I am taken, by way of shew∣ing,
she could have <HI>her Man</HI>; and I am the Subject of her Revenge,
because she lost, the Person, she had a Liking to.</P>
<P>SHE is a Woman of a strong, but mis∣chievous Understanding;
and letting it be <HI>guided,</HI> by what it should <HI>correct,</HI> her <HI>Hu∣mour,</HI> which is my inveterate Enemy, she can be as poignantly
cruel to me as she plea∣ses. She lets me know, by broad Hints, that she <HI>sees</HI> what would delight me, but is <HI>blind,</HI> like a <HI>Jew,</HI> out of Hardness of Heart. If I ask how I may oblige her, she
is <HI>Dumb</HI>; but if I drop an ambiguous Word, that may be tortured into a
malig∣nant Construction, she can use her Tongue like a Larum.—If I
explain, the Sim∣plicity <PB N="400" REF="409"/> of my Meaning, and beg Pardon
for want of Caution in expressing my-self; her <HI>Ears</HI> are <HI>shut,</HI> and she is like the <HI>Deaf Adder.</HI> The Comparison is
true beyond the <HI>Deafness:</HI> she is like it in my Bosom; she
stings like it, she poisons like it, only with this Difference, That her
Poison is of an <HI>Italian kind</HI>; it lengthens out Torment, and kills,
at Distance of Years, after a painful Confinement.</P>
<P>IN my Father's Presence, this fair Hy∣pocrite, is never <HI>dumb,</HI> but ever <HI>eloquent</HI> in <HI>my</HI> Praise.—Such a
Husband! and such a Wife! We are the happiest Couple:—Then she
calls often upon me, with an Air of Friendship, to be merry, under the
Ef∣fects of the Melancholy she causes. Her <HI>Eyes,</HI> her <HI>Ears,</HI> her <HI>Tongue,</HI> her <HI>Hands,</HI> seem all too little
to oblige me.—The Old Gentleman doats on her.—I help to carry on
the <HI>Farce</HI>; it would be <HI>Tragedy,</HI> if he knew
otherwise.—He blesses his Stars, and very comfortably puts me in
Mind, how much I possess the Joy he wished me.</P>
<P>WHAT is to be done with this Riddle of a Woman, so much <HI>in</HI> her Senses, and <HI>out</HI> of them, as she pleases? What
Pro∣spect can I have of Happiness, but from her Death; whom, by my Publick
Vow, and <HI>hard-tugg'd Virtue,</HI> I am obliged to sup∣port, <HI>in
Sickness.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="401" REF="410"/> I WOULD never have complain'd, but that I
hope it may be a proper Caution, and serve for the Preservations of others;
I am pleas'd, that I never discover'd these Grievances, because, had I
complained eve∣ry Time, I had Occasion, I should have been asham'd to
complain any longer, and she would have appeared as irreprehensible, as an
Angel: Thus I have a Fortune, which has been the Purchase of Misery. To
make me rich, my Relations have made me wretched; and, for my part, I have
nothing to hope, but that long Patience, and Sufferings may make me
insensible.</P>

<P>TO what a Multitude of Sorrows is this genteel Complainer betray'd;
The first Con∣siderations, that ought to precede a Matri∣monial Choice, are
the Piety, Education, Person, and Liking of both Parties; indeed, a competent
Fortune, is a material Conside∣ration to be weighed together with the others;
but never separately from them. Of this <HI>Pliny,</HI> the politest
Gentleman, as well as finest Writer of his Age, has given us a
satis∣factory Account in Two of his Epistles, which I am glad, for the
Benefit of the La∣Ladies, <PB N="402" REF="411"/> to find published in Two
Volumes in in <HI>Eaglish.</HI> In one, he shews us his Judg∣ment in
chusing a Husband, for a Friend's Relation; in the other, the happy Effects
of a judicious Choice, in the Person of his own Wife.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To <HI>JUNIUS MAURITIUS;</HI> on chusing a Husband for his
Relation.</HEAD>
<P>THE particular Opinion you have of my Choice of a Husband for your
Brother's Daughter, is very obliging; you well know, how much I loved and
esteemed that great Man; with what Advice he che∣rished my Youth, and by
his own Com∣mendation, gave me the Credit of being thought Praise-worthy: You
could have in∣joined me nothing of greater Consequence, or more agreeable,
nor any Thing I would undertake with more Honour, than to chuse a Man fit to
continue the Family of <HI>Arulenus Rusticus,</HI> which, indeed, might prove
a Work of Time, did not <HI>Minucius Acilianus</HI> luckily present, who, as
young Men do each other (for he is some Years younger) loves me intimately,
yet treats me with a Respect due to Age. He is plea∣sed to be form'd and
instructed by me, as I us'd to be by you. His Country is <HI>Bresica,</HI>
of that Part of our <HI>Italy,</HI> that does yet re∣tain, and keeps up much of
the Antient Modesty, Frugality, and even Rusticity. His Father <HI>Minucius
Macrinus,</HI> eminent in <PB N="403" REF="412"/> the <HI>Equestrian</HI>
Order, for he aimed no high∣er, being chose by <HI>Vespasian</HI> into
the <HI>Prae∣torian,</HI> with great Constancy preferr'd an honest Ease
to this our Ambition (shall I call it?) or Honour. His Grandmother, of the
Mother's Side, is <HI>Serana Procula</HI> of <HI>Pa∣dua</HI>; you are
acquainted with the Manners of the Place, yet <HI>Serana</HI> is to the <HI>Patavins</HI> an Example of strict Virtue. His Uncle <HI>P. Acilius</HI>
is a Man of singular Discretion, Prudence, and Honesty; in Truth, you
will meet with nothing in the whole Fami∣ly less agreeable than in your own. <HI>Acili∣anus</HI> himself, has a great deal of Vigour and Industry,
accompanied with the utmost Modesty. And having already discharged the
Offices of <HI>Questor, Tribune,</HI> and <HI>Praetor,</HI> with Abundance of
Credit, yet he has re∣ferr'd it to you to make his Court for him. He has a
comely Face, a sanguine Comple∣ction, his whole Person Gentleman-like, with
a becoming Gravity in his Mein, Things, I think, not to be disregarded, but
due to the Merit of a virtuous Woman. I am in Doubt, whether I need take
No∣tice of the large Estate of his Father; for when I consider You, for
whom we propose a Son-in-Law, I think I need not: When I reflect on the <HI>Common Custom,</HI> and even the Laws of the City, which principally have
Regard to the Fortunes of Men, <HI>that</HI> seems, by no Means, to be
omitted, and to one that thinks of Posterity; this, in <PB N="404" REF="413"/>
the making of a Match, is not the least material Consideration. Perhaps you
will think I have indulged too much the Love of my Friend in this Account; but
I will stake my Credit, you shall find every thing exceed my Description:
I love the young Man, indeed, most ardently, as he deserves; but it is the
Duty of Friendship, to be mo∣derate in Commendation.</P>
</LETTER>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To <HI>HISPULLA,</HI> his Wife's Aunt.</HEAD>
<P>AS I remember that great Affection, which was between you and your
ex∣cellent Brother, and know you love his Daughter as your own, so as not
only to express the Tenderness of the best of Aunts; but even supply
that of the best of Fathers: I am sure it will be a Pleasure to you to
hear, that she proves worthy of her Father, worthy of you, and of your and
her An∣cestors. Her Ingenuity is admirable, her Frugality extraordinary: She
loves me, the surest Pledge of her Virtue, and adds to this, a wonderful
Disposition to Learning, which she has acquired from her Affection to me:
She reads my Writings, studies them, and even gets them by Heart: You would
smile to see the Concern she is in, when I have a Cause to plead, and
the Joy she shews, when it is over: She finds Means to have the first
News brought her, of the Success I meet with in Court; how I am heard, and
what Decree is made. If I <PB N="405" REF="414"/> recite any Thing in Publick,
she cannot refrain from placing herself privately in some Corner to hear,
where, with the ut∣most Delight, she feasts on my Applauses. Sometimes
she sings my Verses, and accom∣panies them with the <HI>Lute,</HI>
without any Master, except Love, the best of Instru∣ctors. From these
Instances I take the most certain Omens of our perpetual and in∣creasing
Happiness, since her Affection is not founded on my Youth and Person,
which must gradually decay; but she is in Love with the immutable Part of
me, my Glory and Reputation. Nor, indeed, could be less expected from One,
who had the Happiness to receive her Education from you; who, in your House
was accustomed to every Thing that was virtuous and de∣cent, and even began
to love me by your Recommendation: For, as you had always the greatest
Respect for my Mother, you were pleased from my Infancy to form me, to
commend me, and kindly to presage, I should be, One Day, what my Wife
fan∣cies I am. Accept therefore our united Thanks; mine, that you have
bestowed her on me, and hers, that you have given me to her, as a mutual
Grant of Joy and Felicity.</P>

<P>DETRACTORS may be said to lead their Lives in a Habit of most
injurious Falshood towards good Men, and of the most offensive Impiety to
Heaven. Persons, of this itching and abandoned Appetite, may, If we
consider the numerous Mischiefs they do to human Society, be compared to
the most ravenous Beasts of Prey, with this Difference, That, as Beasts
of Prey do good sometimes, in worrying one another, these, on the
con∣trary, will not fall upon, or devour any thing but what is excellent.</P>
<P>WIT, Wisdom, Beauty, good Humour, Modesty, Valour, Integrity, in
fine, all the Virtues and all the Graces, which can illustrate any Person
of either Sex, are as so many tempt∣ing <PB N="407" REF="416"/> <HI>Spoils</HI> to the savage Slanderer, and strong Provocatives to
Detraction. There is scarce a Man living, that has many little, infamous
Srories, more than ordinary, privately handed about wirh great Industry, from
one to ano∣ther, in order to depreciate his Character in the World, but what
will be found, upon a close Examination, to have merited publick Ap∣plause
for some noble Action or other; Ex∣amine still farther, and it will as
certainly be found, that <HI>that</HI> noble Action was the very Source of a <HI>secret</HI> Envy and a <HI>private</HI> Hatred, which broke out in a
Hundred <HI>whisper'd Tra∣ditions,</HI> till it spread and inlarged
itself into <HI>publick Defamation.</HI></P>
<P>THE most unhappy Circumstances which attend the illustrious
Sufferers in this Way, I reckon to be these; That, as Persons, who seek
after Fame the most eagerly, do, for the most part, very plentifully
deserve it; so they are the most frequently interrupted in the Search,
and the least able to bear the Trouble of such unwelcome Interruptions. No
Men are more <HI>Ideally</HI> fond of Glory, than such as most <HI>substantially</HI> deserve it; this is a pleasant Weakness: But
then no Men have a quicker Sensibility of unjust Reproaches than those
who take Care never to deserve them; and this is a sore Frailty, which
opens, through the Bosoms of the Generous and the Innocent, a Way to a
Thousand unnecessary <HI>Heart-Achs.</HI> It is Pity, it should be so
much in the Power of Calumny, as Experience shews it is, to strike 
<PB N="408" REF="417"/> a Damp upon the most Generous Spirits, and throw a
Load over an aspiring Mind, that is upon the Stretch after Glory. But what
seems at present the most of all to be regretted; is, That, by the
frequent Complaints I have lately received, this Vice is as prevailing, as it
is insupportable.</P>
<P>I HAVE a Letter from a Gentleman, containing a very lively
Description of a Lady, whose Charms have been so long drown∣ed in Tears,
that they are almost worn out and carried away by the wasting Tide of her
Sor∣row, which she hides, but cannot stop:—He proceeds to tell me, 
<Q REND="inline">"That, upon Inquiry into the Source of this mighty
Woe, he finds it arose from Two or Three ambiguous and broken Sentences,
glancing at her Virtue, and Conversation, artfully dropp'd by a malicious
Woman in the Ear of a Youth of a Jealous Disposition, who loved her whom <HI>she</HI> loved, who was contracted to her, and departed from her on this
Account.—What signifies talking to her of her inno∣cence, and telling
her, that no Mortal liv∣ing credits it but that <HI>one</HI> Jealous young
Man?—Alas! it is only <HI>his</HI> not be∣lieving it, that must pour
Comfort upon her Affliction.—'Till then she must re∣main as <HI>Inconsolable,</HI> as she is <HI>Innocent.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>MY Correspondent goes on to say, 
<Q REND="inline">"That he had the Curiosity to go and see this
De∣tractress. He found her, as he tells me, Old, Wrinkled, Ugly; her Visage
of a pale, just turning black, as with a Mor∣tification; 
<PB N="409" REF="418"/> her Conscience he takes to be much of a Complexion
with her, Face; for, when he charged her with it, she own'd it as some <HI>trifling Mistake</HI>; then, drawing her Mouth into a scornful Smile,
to con∣tradict her Words, cries out, That <HI>she did not mean it as it was
taken.</HI>—When the <HI>fatal</HI> Consequences were press'd upon
her,—she said, <HI>She was sorry,</HI> but express'd her Grief
so very <HI>unconcernedly,</HI> desiring <HI>to be troubled no more about
it,</HI> since <HI>it was not Actionable,</HI> that she might have sate
for the Picture of <HI>Envy</HI>'s Look, when she has just stollen from
doing one of her most <HI>precious</HI> Mischiefs."—</Q></P>
<P>THIS Correspondent of mine, justly mov'd with his own Relation,
concludes his Letter with warm Expostulations.—
<Q REND="inline">"Shall GUILT <HI>sin</HI> thus! and shall
INNOCENCE look <HI>pale</HI> for it; is there no Redress,—Yes, there
is—Others, who are out of the Question, may, and ought to rise up in
the Defence, of Innocence.—Let the PLAIN DEALER, says he, whenever any
Scandal is traced to the Fountain-head, but mark the Quarters of the
Detractors, as Crosses in the Time of the Pestilence are placed upon the
Doors of the Deceased, and that Method will effectually strike the Tongue
of Detraction dumb."</Q></P>
<P>ANOTHER Account has been lately tran∣smitted to me, concerning a
young Gentle∣man, who is said to have numerous good <PB N="410" REF="419"/>
Qualities, and has been divided from the Estimation of his Friend, by the as
constant as false Insinuations of a worse than once perjured Woman; who
insists, That the young Gentleman betrayed his Friend's Liberty for a
Bribe.—The contrary has been made out, and attested to her
Face—She con∣tinues, behind his Back, to load him with the
Calumny.—Finding, since she began her Evil Reports, that they would
not take with∣out putting on an Air of Charity and Sanctity, she now
concludes her Story to Srrangers thus. 
<Q REND="inline">"—He (meaning the Person she aims to
scandalize) is generally allowed to be a good Man, an honest
Man—Pretty ge∣nerally indeed.—But what is there to be said for
Accidents in this World?—There is nothing wonderful—Nothing new
under the Sun.—I have so often Occasion to Wonder, that I am
resolved never to let any Thing, for the Future, surprize me into a Fit of
Admiration.—He is no Lover of Money—that is certain, as some
say.—But, say they what they will, there is such a Prevalence in
Bribes, no one knows his own Strength till he be tri∣ed.—There is no
trusting any Body.—I would not have believed it of him if <HI>Every-Body had not said it</HI>; but, <HI>What Every-Body says must
be true.</HI>"—</Q></P>
<P>HERE my Correspondent says, he asked the Detractress, <HI>How
Every-Body came to know it?</HI> and she immediately boasted, That she 
<PB N="411" REF="420"/> was the Discoverer of it, to all who heard it at <HI>first Hand,</HI> 
<Q REND="inline">"To what, continues he, may we properly liken such a
dangerous Crea∣ture as this is, who puts out false Colours that she may
come up safe, and rob Virtue, unsuspected? She can be compared to
no∣thing that resembles her so nearly as a <HI>Witch,</HI> in one of
those fatal Operations, where Murder is the Consequence of her
Incantations. The Detractress molds her Descriptions, as the <HI>Witch</HI>
does her Waxen Images. When the <HI>Witch</HI> has made an End of her Image,
the bewitch'd Body perishes; and where the Detractress ends any of her
Descriptions, she makes an in∣jur'd Reputation die!"</Q></P>
<P>I HAVE other Accounts of the like Sort, to all which I shall give an
Answer, in a future Paper, when I shall explain my self at large upon
this Head.</P>

<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE been Married about Two Years to a Young Woman that is every
Way agreeable to my Temper, but only she is given to be a little too
Superstitious. The Truth is, she was determined in her Choice of me by the
Prediction of a For∣tune-teller. Without thinking myself more oblig'd to him,
than in good Reason I <PB N="413" REF="422"/> should. I may safely say,
without Supersti∣tion, that I shall like him for having cau∣sed my good
Fortune, by foretelling it, the longest Day I have to live. She would be the
best-natur'd Creature in the World, if her Mind was not haunted by Spirits,
Sto∣ries of which, take up most of her Con∣versation by Day, and make her
waken me a Nights very frequently. I laugh'd at these little Tales at
first, but, not being able to get her out of them, I indulged her in the
relating them, which she has conti∣nued to do so prettily, that, though I
know, according to right Reason, I ought not to be Terrified, I am brought to
trem∣ble at the tumbling of a Saltseller.—If my Wife could be once
cured, I am sure I should be well soon after.—She has been for
these Three Months last, counting our Hours by a Death-watch, and has made
me almost sick with Fear, that she, who so often speaks of her Death,
should die in good Earnest—This splenetick Cast of her Temper
having an Effect on me, who sympathize with her in every Thing, throws a
Gloom over our Hours, which would otherwise pass as delightfully, as any
Couple's upon Earth.—Pray give her some better Reasons, than I am
able to in∣still into her, to fortify her Mind against these little
Surprizes of Superstition; and you will make her the best Wife in the
World, who studies to <HI>be,</HI> and <HI>is,</HI> EASY to me 
<PB N="414" REF="423"/> in every Case, but this, that she is UNEASY to her

<P>YOU have pretended to give Laws about People's Behaviour in
Marri∣age, and there is no such Thing in Nature to be done. I am a Man of the
best Hu∣mour in the World, or otherwise I could not please my Wife, by
appearing to be the Worst. If I am not angry half a do∣zen Times a Day, she
will be out of Hu∣mour, and not speak to me. I found out her Delight, and
have got many a sweet Kiss for what in another Couple would have gone near
to have caused a Divorce. She uses a hundred Plots to put me out of
Hu∣mour, all which encreases my good Nature, so much, knowing that poor <HI>Molly</HI> falls out for nothing but to make Friends, that I sometimes
find it <HI>hard</HI> to be <HI>pleas'd</HI> to be <HI>angry</HI> with her. I
am, perhaps, the <HI>merri∣est</HI> Man of a <HI>passionate</HI> one,
that was ever known; and my Wife, the most <HI>contented</HI> of all <HI>Sufferers.</HI> I should weary your Pa∣tience, if I was to tell you the
different Stratagems, by which she almost tires out my good Humour, to make
me exert it in trying her Patience. My Shoemaker, has <PB N="415" REF="424"/> a
Wife as like her as Two <HI>Lasts.</HI> But she is more violent in her
Cravings; insomuch that he is forced to proceed, from <HI>Sound,</HI> to <HI>Substance.</HI>—He says, she never is a kinder Bedfellow, than
when she has induc'd him to do her the Kindness to bang her into Bed. He
adds, that he has bound her to him in all Kindness, by laying his Strap over
her Shoulders almost every Day she lives. If he miss it some Days
together, the poor Thing cries, and thinks herself neglected. You, see what
Happiness there is in Matri∣mony: And that there are other Rules for

Minutes.</HI>) two <HI>Boys</HI> hold up their Hands, and bid the Man, that has
run the <HI>Course,</HI> be happy all his Life after. I don't doubt but when <HI>Bar∣tholomew</HI> Fair was put to so early a Period, you deplored the
Accident, because, lasting a little longer, the odd Mirth of the Peo∣ple,
that frequented it, would have fur∣nished you with Materials without going

but come and see it; When I see the Wheel go round, and the Racers are by
at the Twirling of it, my Imagination re∣presents it to me, like the flying
Chariots, and Machines, for young Travellers in <HI>Smith∣field,</HI> in which,
methinks, I see an Ap∣prentice seated over the Head of a

<P>THE Estimation, of publick Actions, seems to me to be unjustly
calculated, Men derive the <HI>Quality</HI> of Actions from that of the Actor;
Would it not be more just to measure the Actor by the Action? The An∣cients
considered the Degrees of Superiority to consist in those of Merit and
Virtue. <HI>Pliny</HI> has distinguish'd himself, by Remarks, on this
Head, in his admirable Epistles, and tho' he was at the <HI>Head</HI> of the <HI>Nobles,</HI> as well as the <HI>Wits</HI> of his Age, he thought it not
below him, to pay Acknowledgments, <PB N="420" REF="429"/> nay, refined
Compliments, to the Merit of Persons in low Life; but took a worthy Pride in
raising them from the Obscurity, annexed to that Condition, by a <HI>Comparison</HI> with the highest renowned for Deeds which sprang from
the same Greatness and Elevati∣on of Spirit. As Titles are often but
Acci∣dents, this is a just Way of Judging; since Worth is not the
Consequence of a Name, but a great Name ought ever to be the Consequence of
Virtue.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"MODERN Writers," said our <HI>Critick,</HI> the
other Evening, "have gone into a different Turn of Thinking: They extol, to the
Skies, the indifferent Actions, and palliate the Blemishes, of Titled People,
who disgrace the Figure of Life they ap∣pear in; but meanly, decline the
right Use of Art upon Subjects, where they might point out Greatness in
obscure Men, who were never <HI>little</HI> in any Thing but the <HI>Accident</HI> of their Birth, and who <HI>living</HI> and <HI>dying,</HI>
did an Honour to Human Nature. Such Pen-men may be called, <HI>The Rabble of
the Wits,</HI> who are dazled by the false Glare of the Great, but can look
at solid, Virtue, without the least Emotion, or Sign, of being able to
see it. The Stiles of these petty Panegyrists, are, like their Subjects,
glittering, but not solid; swel∣ling, but rather empty than great; they
seem never to have heard of that beautiful <PB N="421" REF="430"/> Simplicity,
which arises out of Nature, and forms the Sublime, so much admired by the
Readers, and so masterly executed by the Writers of Antiquity."</Q></P>
<P>WE were led into this Track of Thinking, by my looking, the other Day,
into a little Book, call'd, <HI>The History of the Preservation of</HI>
Charles <HI>the Second, after the noted Battle of</HI> Worcester; which was
fought in the Year 1651, on the Third of this very Month of <HI>September.</HI>
I there meet with such a prodigi∣ous Instance of Fidelity, and Loyalty, in
a poor mean Country Fellow, nam'd <HI>Pendrell,</HI> and all his <HI>Family,</HI> that I know not <HI>any</HI> so Illustrious, to which my
Heart would lead me to pay greater, or sincerer Acknowledge∣ments. I am not
at all surprized, to find, that this amazing Incident, of Integrity, is
coolly, and insensibly, treated by Men of slender Abilities; who have an
Affectation to shine upon more pompous Subjects; who chuse rather to
spend their Strength in relat∣ing the Fury of that Battle, and lay out all
their mistaken Eloquence in raising the Pow∣ers of Hell, to push on its
horrible Conse∣quences; but it is both a Matter of Surprize, and Confusion,
to think, that so many truly great Poets, and Orators, should live just
af∣ter, and leave an Example, so beneficial to Posterity, in a manner
forgotten, for want of being commended, with that Spirit it so richly
deserves.</P>
<P><PB N="422" REF="431"/>PERHAPS the History of the whole World, were
we to turn it never so carefully over, could furnish us with but few Things
more astonishing, more moving, and pathetick, more exemplary, and edifying,
than this un∣celebrated Passage!—A Monarch to be forced, by a
prevailing Faction, to turn a Fugitive, in his own Kingdoms! And when
discomfited Princes, disabled Lords, and routed Armies, could no longer
assist their Sovereign, that it should be reserved for a poor
simple Hind to preserve this Lord's Anointed from a cruel, pursuing
Victor, whose praeternatural Swells of Fortune made him the Terror of all <HI>Christendom!</HI>—That it should be reserved for an ignorant
Country∣man, to save a wise and mighty Prince from falling, like his good
Father, to be after∣wards, received as our Glory, with the Ap∣plauses and
Acclamations, not only of our own Three Kingdoms, but all the Nations about us!
And shall this <HI>Englishman,</HI> record∣ed with Honour, by foreign
Writers, be only coldly spoken of by our own?—Is he a mean Man?
Consider the noble Trust, and the nobler Discharge of it! and he grows
great in Proportion to the Littleness of his Condition. Is he Poor? How does
that Po∣verty add to the Richness of his Virtue, who hears <HI>Praemiums</HI>
bid for the precious Life, he has in Custody, and yet, disdaining the Bribe
of Gold, ventures his own for his Loyalty? Sure, nothing but a Soul, which is
abandon'd <PB N="423" REF="432"/> to Barbarity and Meanness, can let a little
Idea of him take Place, upon Account of his despicable Figure. It is the
noblest Addition to his Greatness! As inconsiderable as he might be
otherwise, he must, in this View, make a fine Picture, and he is a living
Dis∣grace to that Herd of Titled Criminals, who follow'd the Fortunes, and
partook the im∣pious Greatness, of the Pursuer of Majesty. Let those,
who look no farther than the out∣side of Things, think a <HI>Plebian,</HI>
below <HI>Eulo∣gy</HI>; I, who view him with other Eyes al∣most think him
above it. Had he lived in more generous Times, and been the Preser∣ver of an <HI>Augustus,</HI> his honest Contempt of Gold, would have justly given
him a Place equal with <HI>Camillus,</HI> in the <HI>Horatian</HI> Ode,
consecrated to the Praises of that Emperor.</P>
<P>IT is a Scene, that the Imagination can∣not entertain without a
Mixture of Grief and Admiration, when we place before our Eyes that Prince in
the Habit of a Rustick, amidst so many different Dangers, relying upon
the Conduct and Fidelity of this <HI>real</HI> Rustick, this venerable Clown,
and his little Family for his Guards. I remember to have been informed, by a
very great Man, That 
<Q REND="inline">"He has heard the King tell the Story in Jest, and
wonder'd to see many smile, when his Majesty said pleasantly, That <HI>He He was once in danger of losing his Guide in the Night-Time, but that
the Rustling of</HI> Richard<HI>'s Calves-Skin Breeches was a Dire∣ction</HI>
<PB N="424" REF="433"/> <HI>to his Ear in the Dark.</HI> The King might, indeed,
make a Jest of it, said he, but I could not think of Majesty in such
Distress, without being touch'd in good Earnest, by a Grief, which it was
beyond the Notion of an odd and comical Dress to remove."</Q>—I must
say the same, as this Nobleman, with regard to the King; and even as to <HI>Pendrell,</HI> there is some∣thing too serious in his Integrity, not to
make us lose his Appearance, in our Venera∣tion of his Virtues. As there was
a Princely Person in one rough Garb; there was a noble Soul in the other; for
when he attended the King, for the last Time, he shewed, he had a true
Sense of the Weight of his Charge. For, his Majesty complaining of the
Horse, <HI>That it was the heaviest Jade he ever rode on; Pendrell,</HI>
smilingly told him, <HI>That the Horse had the Weight of Three Kingdoms on
his Back, and ought not therefore to be blamed, if he went a little
heavily.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN I Meditate the many Passages, that this little History
recounts, between the King and <HI>Pendrell,</HI> my Attention is so fixed to
the Parts, which exercised this Man's Fi∣delity, that I scarce have Room in
my Thoughts, for the Glories of a Restora∣tion, that he was reserved for. I
love to dwell upon this good Man: It is a familiar Example, but it is the more
useful; the Least Man may be faithful, and Fidelity will make him Great;
while the Greatest Man, with∣out <PB N="425" REF="434"/> Integrity, dwindles
into a Little one.—It is true, also, Integrity makes a Great Man much
Greater; so it is with <HI>Ge∣neral Monk,</HI> a Name, far beyond his Title.
Duke of <HI>Albemarle,</HI> strikes no Ear; calls for no Admiration. But
Every one admires the <HI>General</HI> and the <HI>Restorer.</HI></P>
<P>A LITTLE gentlemanly Estate was after∣wards settled upon his
Descendants; and had he been advanced by the Pleasure of the King, from
that lowly Degree, to the No∣bility, no Lord could have thought himself
injur'd, by having for his Peer, and Compa∣nion, the Heir of that worthy Man,
who preserved the Fountain of Honour.</P>

<P><HI>CREDULITY</HI> is a Weakness, from which very few are exempted.
It is the Ground-work of Craft and Imposture; and the Means by which they are
propa∣gated.</P>
<P>I HAVE often reflected, with Concern, upon the Condition of Humanity,
in this Regard: And nothing can be more afflicting, than to behold one Part of
the rational World making a <HI>Trade</HI> of misguiding the other! If all
the Errors, into which People are drawn, had but the Marks of <HI>Truth,</HI>
some Excuse, might be found for their <HI>Cre∣dulity</HI>; but the Shame
is, in their receiving what is <HI>new,</HI> at the Expence, even of <HI>Proba∣bability.</HI> <PB N="427" REF="436"/> Vulgar Minds are most
struck with what is most incredible; and the Way to <HI>convince,</HI> is,
to <HI>amaze</HI> them. <HI>Reason</HI> makes few Proselytes: But <HI>Mystery</HI> rarely fails. And the less they know why, the fonder they
grow of the Imposture.</P>
<P>BECAUSE I would not dip into Contro∣versies, wherein <HI>Religion,</HI> and <HI>Government,</HI> are concern'd; I must descend
into Low Life, and only touch the little Artifices which owe their Reputation
to this Weakness.</P>
<P>THE World is wearied with Stories of <HI>Witches</HI> and <HI>Fairies,</HI> and begins to see thro' the Imposture. The Craft of <HI>Astrologers, Conjurers,</HI> and <HI>Prophets,</HI> begins also to be
ex∣ploded, by the Vulgar, whose <HI>Oracles</HI> they have long been. But I
am not a little amaz'd to find, that, instead of the Delusions, once
practis'd on the Multitude, They, now, work strongest among the polite and
fashionable People. What Staring, what Clapping, what Waste of Time and
Money have <HI>Harlequin</HI> and <HI>Faustus</HI> occasion'd? The
Madness, both of <HI>Actors,</HI> and <HI>Spectators,</HI> has so provok'd
me almost to Tears, that I could even have <HI>wept over the City!</HI></P>
<P>I WILL not be so partial, to our Wor∣shipful Society of FREE <HI>and</HI> ACCEPTED MASONS, as to forbear reproving them, on this Occasion,
for the unaccountable Po∣ther and Noise they have lately made in the World.
What Stories have been told to amuse, and engage the <HI>Credulous?</HI> What
<PB N="428" REF="437"/> Reflections, what Reproach, have they brought upon That
ANCIENT ORDER, by making Proselytes, in so cheap and so prosti∣tuted a
Manner? It afflicts me sensibly, when I see Coxcombs introduc'd into our <HI>Lodges,</HI> and made privy to our <HI>Secrets.</HI> I have often enter'd
my Protest against this Abuse, in pri∣vate Society; and must use the
Freedom to offer this Memorial, in my publick Character. 'Tis my Opinion, That
the late Prostitution of our <HI>Order</HI> is in some Measure, the
betraying it. The weak Heads of <HI>Vintners, Drawers, Wig∣makers,
Weavers,</HI> &amp;c. admitted into our <HI>Frater∣nity,</HI> have not only
brought Contempt upon the Institution, but do very much endanger it. And I
have heard it ask'd, Why we don't admit <HI>Women,</HI> as well as <HI>Taylors,</HI> into our <HI>Lodges?</HI> I must confess I have met with
as <HI>sufficient</HI> Heads among the <HI>Fair Sex,</HI> as I have found in
the BROTHERHOOD: I have some Reasons to fear, that our SECRETS are in
Danger. There is, in the Conduct of too many, since their Admission, the 
<Q> 
<L>— Caecus amor sui,</L> 
<L>Et tollens vacuum plus nimio Gloria verticem;</L> 
<L>Arcanique Fides prodiga, perlucidior vitro;</L> </Q> which is
expresly prohibited by our Excellent RULES and CONSTITUTIONS; and, which is
the very Characteristick of the Fools, that were received into the LODGES at <HI>ROME,</HI> in the Days of <HI>AUGUSTUS CAESAR</HI>; <PB N="429" REF="438"/>
and whereof our Brother <HI>HORACE</HI> com∣plain'd vehemently, in an <HI>Ode</HI> to <HI>VARUS,</HI> who was then GRAND MASTER. But whatever
Freedoms others imagine they may lawfully and discreetly use, my
Conscience cannot brook them.</P>

<P>MY Female Readers, and, I'm afraid, some of the <HI>Brotherhood</HI>
may stop here, and stare, as if I had blabb'd out the whole <HI>My∣stery.</HI> They may be doubtful whether the above Words, and Dashes
may not be <HI>decy∣pher'd</HI> into the famous <HI>Mason Word?</HI> But I
leave the Ignorant to their <HI>Wonder</HI>; and pro∣ceed to assure my <HI>Brethren,</HI> that they have promoted <HI>Superstition and
Babbling,</HI> contrary to the Peace of our Sovereign Lord, the King, by their
late Practices, and Condescen∣tions. Alarming Reports, and Stories of
LADDERS, HALTERS, DRAWN SWORDS, and DARK ROOMS, have spread Confusion and
Terror: And, if the Government does not put the Laws against us in Execution,
it will be an extraor∣dinary Favour, or <HI>Oversight.</HI> For my own Part,
I am so faithful a Subject, and have the Weal of <HI>Our Ancient Order,</HI>
so much at Heart, that unless the GRAND MASTER puts a Stop to these
Proceedings, by a peremptory <PB N="430" REF="439"/> Charge to the BROTHERHOOD,
I wish I cou'd honourably enter into ANOTHER.</P>
<P>AND, now I have hinted at ANOTHER <HI>Order,</HI> I must entertain
my Readers with Two Letters; the first address'd to my self, and the
last written from <HI>Rome,</HI> to the Au∣thor of the first.</P>

<SALUTE>Sage SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>BY the Help of my <HI>Secretary</HI> and <HI>In∣terpreter</HI> I
peruse your Lucubrati∣ons; and write this Epistle, to assure you of my
Esteem.</P>
<P>I AM inform'd, that you have taken Notice of the <HI>Advertisement</HI> I caused to be publish'd in the News-Papers; and
that you call'd at the <HI>Castle,</HI> to be satisfy'd of the Truth of my
Arrival in this Place. Your Enquiry, and the Conversation you had with my
Secretary, give me Occasion to gratify you farther; and I am proud to have it
in my Power to distinguish one of your Merit in the Manner I intend.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Laws</HI> and <HI>Constitutions</HI> of the most ancient
and illustrious <HI>Order,</HI> of the <HI>GORMOGONS</HI> oblige us to be <HI>cau∣tious</HI> and <HI>frugal,</HI> in admitting <HI>new Mem∣bers.</HI>
Remarkable <HI>Virtues</HI> have always re∣commended the Candidates. No Rank,
Station, or Condition of Life, intitles a <PB N="431" REF="440"/> Person to be
of our <HI>Fraternity.</HI> We know neither <HI>Prejudice,</HI> nor <HI>Partiality,</HI> in con∣ferring this Honour; and all the <HI>Interest</HI> in the World to procure it, would be fruitless, without <HI>Merit.</HI></P>
<P>MY Residence here will be short. It cannot therefore be
expected, that I shou'd invite many worthy Persons to enter into our <HI>Order</HI>; nor dare I render it cheap and contemptible, by admitting every
Preten∣der: But I know several who deserve to be received, and to whom I
have promis'd the Distinction.</P>
<P>I SHALL consider it as an Ornament to our <HI>most ancient</HI>
and illustrious ORDER, which is the Honour and Ornament of all its Members,
if you, <HI>Sage Sir,</HI> will be pleas'd to accept the Privileges that I am
empower'd to bestow on the <HI>Deserving.</HI> I confess, you must
first be DEGRADED, as our Laws require, and renounce, and abandon, the
Society of <HI>False-Builders.</HI> But, as your great Judgment must
distin∣guish the Excellence of our <HI>Order,</HI> I hope you will prefer
being a <HI>Fellow</HI> with <HI>Us.</HI> Nothing would more sensibly
concern me, when I leave <HI>London,</HI> than not be able to transmit your
Name in the List, that I must send to the OECUMENICAL VOLGEE in <HI>China.</HI></P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHAT I here write to you, is Af∣fection, true (because
spontaneous) Affection to a Family who know not me, or that I am now writing,
or intending to write to you, or any body concerning them.</P>
<P><PB N="435" REF="444"/> I AM just now seated at a Coffee-house,
not far from the <HI>Royal-Exchange,</HI> where I am very much affected (as I
often have been) with the genteel, humble Deport∣ment of the Bar-keeper; A
Deportment most agreeably adapted to her present Sta∣tion.—Yet, at
the same time, such as betokens a Genius superior to this Way of
Livelihood. It is known to every body that sees this Gentlewoman (seeing
her is knowing it) that she is a Gentlewoman: But that, moreover, she has <HI>this</HI> additional Merit, To have been the Comfort, the lov∣ing, and
beloved Comfort, of the great and admirable <HI>Favellus</HI>; this perhaps is
not so universally known.</P>
<P><HI>FAVELLUS</HI> was an eminent Preacher of the Town: Those that
know his Character, can tell 'twas a Compound of all the good Characters
belonging to a Christian, to a Divine, to a Gentleman. He had a most
extensive Genius, which, with his own Edu∣cation and Industry, made vast
Acquire∣ments in all sorts of Theological Literature. This will appear to a
Man of any Sagacity, that makes use of That and his Sermons, when
publish'd, which are now Printing by Subscription. The first of these
Sermons, that was preached in my Hearing, gave me a most surprizing Mixture
of Pleasure and Concern: <HI>Pleasure,</HI> in hearing, at once, a <HI>Demosthenes,</HI> and a <HI>Euclid,</HI> a <HI>Chrysostom,</HI> and a <HI>Bentley</HI> (<HI>All</HI> met together) <HI>All</HI> speak∣ing 
<PB N="436" REF="445"/> in this accomplish'd Divine; who was himself a
most powerful, a most pathetick <HI>Orator,</HI> a most exact <HI>Reasoner,</HI> a most persua∣sive <HI>Theologer,</HI>—in one
Word, <HI>an universal consummate Scholar.</HI>—This was the <HI>Pleasure.</HI> A <HI>Concern</HI> too it gave me (a Concern
in∣expressible) arising from a certain Uneasiness I felt in my own
Breast, from reflecting, that tho' I had been Years in <HI>London,</HI> this
was but my <HI>First</HI> Pleasure of hearing this inimitable Man. After
this, you may be sure I became his eager Attendant: And of All the Sermons I
attended, Head and Heart say this.—They were All, to a Degree that is
incredible, <HI>All</HI> Edifying, All Enter∣taining; Entertaining, I mean in
that Way wherein Theological Performances <HI>may</HI> and <HI>ought</HI> to
entertain. 'Tis rare, <HI>remarkably</HI> rare, to meet with the Man that
writes, or indeed is <HI>capable</HI> of writing, in that Close, that
Mathematical, that Concatenating Way he excell'd in; or, that has the same
Sa∣gacity in <HI>Pointing out</HI> the Intricacies of an Argument, together
with the same Acute∣ness, the same Clearness in <HI>Removing</HI>
'em;—putting Prejudice to the Blush;—re∣conciling Scripture to
Scripture;—making Error <HI>appear</HI> to be Error, Truth to be Truth.
You'd be sure not only to be pleas'd, but to <HI>exult</HI> in the Pleasure
you took, if you had heard him frequently, as I did, ad∣vancing (and that so
ingeniously) some Truths that were uncommon, and defend∣ing 
<PB N="437" REF="446"/> common ones in an uncommon Man∣ner; making obscure
Things plain; plain Things <HI>surprizingly</HI> plainer.—To raise
Objections so <HI>pertinently,</HI> to state 'em so <HI>can∣didly,</HI>
to answer 'em so <HI>unanswerably,</HI> is a Talent, or rather <HI>many</HI> Talents, wherein but few Men, if few, cou'd come up to him.</P>
<P>I ASK now, Shou'd it not be (Matter of <HI>Wonder</HI> to ALL Men,
and) to Men of Merit, <HI>Concern,</HI> that this very Man, a Man of their own
Number, a Minister of the Gos∣pel too, an <HI>eminent</HI> Minister, an
eminent Writer,—Great in Learning,—Great in Goodness,—Great
in Renown,—Of a meek humble, winning Disposition,—Of a sweet,
sober, edifying Conversation,—Of a blameless, of an unspotted
Cha∣racter,—Withal too, a Man of strict <HI>Or∣thodoxy</HI> (and is not <HI>This</HI> alone a Thousand good Characters?)—I say, shou'd it
not, even in Point of <HI>Humanity</HI> (much more so of <HI>Charity</HI>)
affect <HI>All</HI> Men <HI>of Merit</HI> or that <HI>love</HI> Merit, to
observe how it pass'd unrewarded, slighted, discourag'd, tho' seen
plainly, tho' admir'd universally, in this excellent Man?</P>
<P>THINK—(and grieve when you think) how he Died! How Indigent!
How <HI>exceed∣ingly</HI> Indigent!—and this, after a Life wherein there
was nothing of Excess,—ex∣cept that of its being painful, <HI>willingly</HI> pain∣ful to <HI>Himself,</HI>—and that purposely
that it might be useful to <HI>Others.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="438" REF="447"/> BEHOLD him, <HI>when Living,</HI> living
blamelessly in every Thing;—<HI>Blamelessly</HI> did I say? It had
been just to have said, <HI>Admirably</HI> in every Thing: Admirably every
where: <HI>At Home</HI> Studious, at Home Frugal, in all his Oeconomy: <HI>Abroad</HI> sel∣dom—except at his Church: <HI>At Church</HI>
attended with a full Congregation (perhaps the fullest in this great City,
wherein were Persons of almost all Denominations, all all Ranks and
Perswasions; all pleas'd, all <HI>greedy</HI> to hear this incomparable
Man.—And yet,</P>
<P>BEHOLD him, <HI>when Dying,</HI> not worth enough to defray the
Charge of his Funeral! <HI>Now,</HI> it appears (thro' his own singular
Modesty, it did not <HI>till now</HI>) What a poor Livelihood (—Wonder,
and be astonish'd! and yet this was <HI>All</HI> his Livelihood (for
himself and Family) he got by the Mini∣stry: Poor! so deplorably poor,
that his di∣stress'd Widow, and Two or Three young lovely Children, at
least <HI>some</HI> of 'em, are likely, e'er long, (—O pity! pity!)
even to—I <HI>cannot</HI> speak it!—What shall I
say?—My Heart bleeds when I think of it. He died, as I'm told, not
worth Ten Shillings.</P>
<P>WITHIN the Circle of your Acquain∣tance, and my own, there are, <HI>some,</HI> no doubt, that have Inclinations, but want <HI>Abilities</HI>
to be Beneficent; some, that have Abilities, but want Inclinations: Some, 
<PB N="439" REF="448"/> that have <HI>Both,</HI> and would imploy both, but know
not <HI>where</HI> to employ 'em. To these last sort of Persons, to all
these able-well-in∣clining Persons, namely, to all that have <HI>no
Heirs</HI> of their own to inherit after them, or have more Riches than enough
for their Heirs, and for such like Reasons have gene∣rous Design, I
say, To <HI>these</HI> surely I need not say more.</P>
<P>PITY, even common Pity, mov'd me thus to throw in a Word or two (I
hope, at least, 'twill have <HI>some</HI> favourable Conse∣quence) in
Favour of this unhappy Widow and Children (the Melancholy Remains of that
Learned Good Man I have been speak∣ing of); and the this rather, because,
as you see, they are now reduc'd, for the Sake of a Subsistence, to the
Business of a Coffee-house.</P>
<P>THE Widow's Demeanor, in this new Way of Life, as I told you, <HI>genteel</HI> Humility, sub∣missive, easy, chearful in this the
Station allotted her, <HI>Because</HI> 'tis allotted her. She has this
Character, in all its Beauty and Elegance, in all the Nicety and Goodbreed∣ing
belonging to it. See the <HI>Whole</HI> of her Conduct. See in that, the <HI>worst</HI> of Adver∣sities in its best Dress. Whoever attends to it
(and whoever beholds <HI>cannot but</HI> attend to it) has a very <HI>instructive</HI> Amusement. There is scarce an Action she does,
that in this Way is not an excellent Document, being itself a Comment on that
polite Humility I am speaking of. To see her, just now, bring∣ing 
<PB N="440" REF="449"/> me the Dish of Coffee, I call'd for, with HER <HI>peculiar</HI> Way of doing it, is an admir∣able Criticism on those
Words of St. <HI>Paul, I know HOW to be abased.</HI> And to attend her,
saying <HI>Sir, I thank you,</HI> and her <HI>Man∣ner</HI> of saying it
(—with the Curt'sy an∣nex'd) to a Gentleman that a while ago laid his
Penny at the Bar, is perhaps a bet∣ter Sermon than many a Divine cou'd have
made on this Text of St. <HI>Peter</HI> [<HI>Be Courteous</HI>] So much for the
Widow.</P>
<P>THE Children (poor, fatherless, undone Children!) seem to carry
an Hereditary Goodness in their very Aspects. It wou'd melt <HI>any</HI>
Heart to behold them; any, es∣pecially, that remembers that worthy Fa∣ther
they descended from.</P>
<P>SIR, Sure you are affected with this Me∣lancholy Narrative: 'Tis
Truth. Inquire, and you'll find it <HI>All</HI> to be Truth, as related to you,

<SALUTE>Dear SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN my last I griev'd, in this I rejoice; as you will, when I tell
you that the distress'd Widow of the late Reverend and Excellent <HI>Favellus</HI> is lately Married to a Good Man, and an ample Estate, ample
<PB N="441" REF="450"/> enough to provide handsomly for her and her Children.
Behold the Benevolence, be∣hold the Goodness, the Superlative Good∣ness of <HI>Amasius</HI>! that has thought fit to be∣stow Himself, and his All!
and this with∣out Hurt to any Relation of his own. I esteem, I admire the
Man, 'tho I know him not. I'm all Joy and Transport, and impatient to tell it
you. I can write nothing else;—therefore conclude in an Extasy.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>'TIS the Opinion of me, and of many that the two Letters, I
inclose, may pass with Advantage thro' your Hands to the Publick. If too
long, abridge 'em as you think fit. I was at <HI>Cambridge,</HI> when I reciv'd
both from <HI>Maecenas,</HI> who I must tell you, is a Gentleman of the <HI>Temple,</HI> that won't permit me to say more of him; nor need I to a
Person, of <HI>your</HI> Taste and Dis∣cernment, that can read the Soul
of a Man in his Letters.</P>
<P>BE just, Sir, to such a remarkable Piece of Generosity as this
of <HI>Amasius,</HI> and con∣vince the World, that it is not only an
un∣common <HI>Generosity,</HI> but an uncommon <HI>good Sense</HI>; a good
Sense, perhaps, which a <PB N="442" REF="451"/> great many <HI>foolish</HI>
People have not a <HI>Notion of,</HI> and which a great many wise ones have <HI>only</HI> a Notion of.</P>
<P>THE like Conduct to this of <HI>Amasius,</HI> was t'other Day,
that of <HI>THEODOSIA,</HI> a Lady of an amiable Character, and of a very
con∣siderable Family and Fortune. She has had a long and intimate Knowledge
of <HI>Honestus,</HI> and of All his Good Qualities. She has of∣ten heard,
often seen, what a kind Hus∣band he made to his Wise, whom he has lately
lost, and with her an Estate, that was all he had to subsist upon. He
had met with many Adversities, many Trials before. But this was the
greatest. He bore it man∣fully; hoping, trusting, resting, firmly and
chearfully, in an Almighty Wisdom, Goodness, and Providence. With this
Re∣solution, he made a friendly Visit to his Ac∣quaintance in the Country;
among the rest, to <HI>Theodosia,</HI> who receiv'd him kindly, and pity'd
him. He there fell ill of a Fever, during which, she gave him a Thousand
Proofs of her Tenderness! and, after he had recover'd, added this to the
Number of 'em, <HI>She Married him</HI>—Not without the Ad∣vice of her
best Friends and Relations.—</P>
<P>THIS is the Character of <HI>Honestus</HI>; a great deal of <HI>Merit,</HI> but, withal, a great deal of <HI>Poverty,</HI> and <HI>Four
Children</HI> along with it. For <HI>this</HI> she's reflected on. Cruel
World! thus to treat the generous <HI>Theodosia</HI>! And thus to treat her, <HI>because</HI> she is generous! <PB N="443" REF="452"/>—Cruelty
itself! But incourage her, I beseech you, Sir, and let it be <HI>your</HI>
Gene∣rosity to say all you can in behalf of <HI>Theo∣dosia</HI>'s.</P>
<P>HEREBY, (if speedy) you'll oblige many besides,</P>

<P>WE regard not Rivals in <HI>Love,</HI> with more Malice than Rivals in <HI>Fame:</HI> And the softer Sex, is most liable to the ma∣lignant

their Appli∣cation is more <HI>intense</HI> and <HI>collected:</HI> And they
brook Disappointments with less Comfort and Moderation.</P>
<P><PB N="444" REF="453"/><HI>WIT</HI> and <HI>Beauty,</HI> are the Arms
they conquer by; It is with Jealousy, therefore, that they behold them in any

a Reproach: And <HI>her</HI> Soul must be sublimely Great, who, not on∣ly
observes with Pleasure, the Fame and In∣fluence, of a powerful Rival; but
contri∣butes her own Endeavours, to the Support, and Increase of them!</P>
<P>I HAVE been led into these Reflections, by the Delight, with which,
I perus'd the following Letter, and Copy of Verses, which were lately sent
me, by a Lady, who has either too much Generosity, to malign the Excellence
and Applause of others: Or too large a Share of both, herself, to be

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE found, That your Paper has a Power to move the Soul; and
holds a Command over the Passions. Your PLAIN DEALER on <HI>Death,</HI> is
one con∣tinued Beauty. He ought, methinks, to <HI>live</HI> for ever, who can
make <HI>Death</HI> so de∣sirable. While I was reading in it, all Vanity,
and Love of Life forsook me.—My Eyes resign'd themselves to Tears:
and I even seem'd to <HI>feel</HI> the Grave. The beautiful Verse glided
through my Veins; and I trembled, with a <HI>pleasing Horror.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="445" REF="454"/> WHILE my Mind was, thus delight∣fully
sadden'd, Death depriv'd me of a <HI>perfect Friend,</HI> to whose dear
Memory, I have devoted the Lines inclos'd. They have little Beauty, but the
Truth and Passion of my Concern. Perhaps, <HI>That</HI> will plead their
Pardon.</P>
<P>THE Lady, whose Loss I lament, was an Ornament to one Sex; and
the Re∣proach and Admiration of the other. I wonder, a Death, so
considerable, appears so little deplor'd.—Where is <HI>Friendship?</HI>—Was it buried, in <HI>Delia</HI>'s Grave? Let me
invoke it, to lament her.—<HI>She</HI> who cou'd, so gracefully, <HI>mourn,</HI> let <HI>us</HI> mourn <HI>her.</HI>—She, who cou'd give <HI>Life</HI> to our Imagination, let us be sorry for her <HI>Death,</HI> and
assist her Fame, by our Gratitude.</P>
<P><HI>YOU,</HI> Sir, who know how to Charm your Readers, as you
please, I wish, you would chuse this inspiring Subject of <HI>Friend∣ship.</HI> Its divine Spirit is too much confin'd among Persons
of narrow Natures.—As for me, I am not insensible of it: I feel its
Power at my Heart; but can't do Justice in expressing it.—The
Descent to <HI>Age,</HI> and <HI>Affliction,</HI> is smooth'd and
sof∣ten'd, by the Aid of <HI>Friendship.</HI> It rebates the Edge of
sharpest Miseries. We seem <HI>not to grow Old,</HI> when we have a <HI>Friend,</HI> to make Life tasteful to us: Time flies over us, indeed; but
he seems to brush us with downy Wings; and marks his Way, with slight
Impressions.</P>
<P><PB N="446" REF="455"/> WHEN I see a Face, more serene, or more
lovely, than usual, I take Pleasure to imagine, she owes her Sweetness,
to the Influence of some charming Friend's Society. The Soul is quicken'd in
its Energy, by the Power of so divine a Soft∣ness, nor shares, nor
laments, the <HI>Body</HI>'s Miseries.</P>
<P>EXCUSE the Fullness of my Heart, on this favourite Subject: And I
will be frank enough to own, that I am sometimes blest, with a Friend; of <HI>your</HI> Sex, too: And, while I have the Joy of listening to his
Wisdom, methinks, we have already pass'd the <HI>Grave,</HI> and are
enjoying the De∣lights of <HI>Heaven.</HI></P>

<P>I AM charm'd, almost equally, with the <HI>Verse</HI> and <HI>Prose,</HI> of this Lady:—There is in her <HI>Stile,</HI> a
peculiar <HI>Mark,</HI> or <HI>Mole,</HI> which her <HI>Minerva</HI> may be
known by. It is a cer∣tain majestick Shortness in her Periods, im∣pregnated
<PB N="449" REF="458"/> with Sense and Fullness. And her <HI>Poetry</HI> is
so rich in Beauties, that her <HI>Eyes</HI> have scarce more <HI>Fire</HI>;
or her <HI>Mind</HI> more Scope and Sweetness.</P>
<P>IT has often been observ'd, That the Ladies of this Island, are
the most <HI>beautiful</HI> in the Universe. I shall endeavour, for my
Coun∣try's Honour, to prove them also the most <HI>Witty.</HI> And, that
they are most <HI>Wise,</HI> we are under a Political Necessity of
maintain∣ing, because no Remark is more obvious to Foreigners, than, that the
Superiority of our Women's Talents, has almost universally pre∣ferr'd the
Sex, in this happy Corner of the World, to a Right of Governing their
Hus∣bands.</P>
<P>BUT when I come to speak of the <HI>Wit</HI> of our <HI>English</HI> Ladies, I will not do 'em the Injustice of comparing them
with our Male Poets.—There was a <HI>Corinna</HI> among the Antients, who
carried away the Prize of Poetry from the Immortal <HI>Pindar</HI>
himself.—To write better than the <HI>Men,</HI> therefore, is a Triumph
below the Genius of some of our Female Wits, whom I could name, since other
Women have been already, <HI>so far</HI> Con∣querors in other Nations. But,
if I match our modern Muses, against the <HI>Sappho</HI>'s, and <HI>Corinna's</HI> of Antiquity, and they shall be victorious over those
fam'd Victors, That, indeed will be a Glory.</P>
<P>I SHALL consecrate Three future Papers, to the Great, and different
Excellence of Three <PB N="450" REF="459"/> <HI>English</HI> Ladies, who are
all now living; And whose Writings shall be tryed, in a most impartial
Comparison, with the finest, and most celebrated Remnants of Female
Genius, which have been preserv'd and wonder'd at, through a Length of
applauding Ages.—And, I doubt not, but I shall make it demonstrable,
in those Three Papers; that the <HI>English</HI> Ladies have excell'd the
Antients, in the <HI>Depth,</HI> the <HI>Tenderness,</HI> and the <HI>Subli∣mity</HI> of their Compositions.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub"><DATE>FRIDAY, <HI>September</HI> 25. 1724.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>IN a Coffee-Room, the other Day, where the Conversation turn'd on
Wit, a Gen∣tleman was taking Pains to draw an odd kind of Demonstration, from
the List of Subscrib∣ers to Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s <HI>Translation of
Homer,</HI> That there never was an Age so favourable to Poets, 
<PB N="451" REF="460"/> as <HI>This</HI>:—And, That, from the Num∣ber of
our <HI>Noble Patrons,</HI> the Glorious Reign of King <HI>George</HI> will
shine brighter to Posterity than the Reign of <HI>Augustus
Caesar.</HI></P>
<P>THOUGH I love Loyalty, at my Heart, and am as conscious as I ought
to be of the Influences of His Majesty's Glory, yet, I confess, I was a
little startled, at the No∣velty of this Assertion; and express'd my
Surprize, with some Emotion.—I find then, cry'd I, that I have lived in
profound Ignorance!—As for the <HI>Politicks</HI> indeed of the present
Age, I have always consider'd 'em as too <HI>remarkable</HI> to be soon <HI>forgot</HI>: But, for the <HI>Wit</HI> of it, I was in Hopes, there cou'd
be no Danger of its being <HI>remem∣ber'd.</HI></P>
<P>IT seems, continued I, the severest Misery of Men of Learning,
that Custom has mis∣led them to depend, for their Encouragment, on those <HI>Great,</HI> Little, Creatures, whom we call <HI>People of
Quality.</HI>—Were Wisdom the Consequence of Riches, Rank, and Power,
it had been prudent, and reasonable, for Merit in Distress to apply
itself to the <HI>Mighty.</HI>—But, since the Flattery, and
Indul∣gence, in which Those called <HI>Great Men,</HI> are educated, must
give Liberty to their <HI>Passions,</HI> and Restraint to their <HI>Intellects,</HI> (for Under∣standing is scarce necessary to Men who
can pay others, to think for them!) therefore, with due Regard to a few
shining Excepti∣ons, a Lord is <HI>above Wit</HI>: And most of 'em 
<PB N="452" REF="461"/> wou'd have found it more to their Taste, and their
Talent, to subscribe to <HI>Heidegger,</HI> than to <HI>Homer,</HI> but
that the numerous Ac∣quaintance of this fine, and happy Genius united
themselves, so powerfully, to recom∣mend his Translation, that, to be out
of the List, was to be out of the <HI>Fashion:</HI> which Misfortune, no
Doubt, it was well worth <HI>Six Guineas,</HI> to be delivered from the
Disgrace of — But, let me see these shining Names to Mr. <HI>Dennis</HI>'s <HI>Miscellaneous Tracts,</HI> which he is now publishing
by a Subscription, scarce the Sixth Part so chargeable, and I will
afterwards, suppose, that They can <HI>read,</HI> as well as <HI>purchase.</HI>—This, however, is what I know them too well to
expect at their Hands, unless Mr. <HI>Dennis</HI> shall become as much <HI>The Mode</HI> as Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> is.</P>
<P>I WAS surpriz'd to observe, that at my Mention of Mr. <HI>Dennis,</HI> almost every Person present, join'd in a Clamour
against <HI>Criticks.</HI> They affirm'd, <HI>Thus it was but just, to
neglect the Writings of a Person, who only writes, to censure Others.</HI>
And, <HI>That the World shou'd, without Regard to a Critick's Learning,
declare War, against his Malice; and treat, and con∣sider him, as a King of
Common Enemy.</HI></P>
<P>I CONTENTED myself with smiling, at the Extravagance of this
Reasoning, and re∣ply'd, That I doubted hot, however, but the Name of Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> would be found a∣mong Mr. <HI>Dennis</HI>'s <HI>Subscribers</HI>; because He has <HI>Soul</HI> to know, That though
Living Merit, <PB N="453" REF="462"/> may sometimes, as in his own Case, be
po∣pular, yet Popularity is so far from being the <HI>Mark</HI> of Living
Merit, that Real Excellence, for the most Part, both <HI>wants</HI> and <HI>disdains</HI> it.</P>
<P>IN the Progress of my Papers, I am de∣termined to examine into the
Foundation of this silly Notion, <HI>That Criticks are Enemies to Wit and
Learning:</HI> And I dare be positive, before-hand, that I shall discover
it to take its Rise from a Cause, of the same Nature with that, which
makes the <HI>Pickpocket</HI> hate the <HI>Horsepond.</HI></P>
<P>TO pretend a Love of Learning, and at the same Time io dispise
Criticism, is as ri∣diculous an Absurdity, as to delight in noble
Buildings, and exclaim against Architecture.—If there is not some <HI>Rule,</HI> whereby we are to measure <HI>Wit,</HI> then Wit has no
Depen∣dance on the Reason, and the Judgment; and, to be a <HI>Wit,</HI> or a <HI>Fool,</HI> are in that Case, Terms Synonimous.—But, if Wit is to be
judg'd, by the Examination of our Reason, then that Reason is <HI>Criticism</HI>: And he, who is a Critick, is the Champion of Wit, and
defends it from Prophanation.—How can he, therefore, be the <HI>Enemy,</HI> of what is supported by his Influence?</P>
<P>THE true Friends of Learning ought to be cautious, how they give up <HI>Criticks</HI>; lest, to free themselves from a present Fear, they
destroy their future Hope, and fall into Ob∣livion, under the Growth of
assuming Igno∣rance: <PB N="454" REF="463"/> Like the Degenerate <HI>Roman</HI> Armies, who slackening the Severity of their old mar∣tial
Discipline, came at length, says <HI>Proco∣pius,</HI> to think Helmets and
Corslets too <HI>hot</HI> for them.—They were cumbersome and
in∣supportable:—They <HI>fainted</HI> under the <HI>Weight</HI> of
'em:—And had Courage enough, they were sure, to fight, as
successfully without 'em.—They tried it: And the Consequence was,
They were never, from that Time forward, able to stand, against the <HI>Arrows</HI> of the over-numbering <HI>Goths,</HI> and <HI>Vandals</HI>: So
depriv'd of their Defence, they lost their Empire to <HI>Barbarians.</HI></P>
<P>BUT, since no Truth operates so power∣fully as that which
convinces by Example, let the Good, or Ill, of Criticism be decided, in fair
Combat, between the Gentleman I have nam'd above, who professes, and forms
himself on it; and one of our most rapid, and voluminous Compilers of
Poetry; who tho' one wou'd imagine him too <HI>heavy</HI> to <HI>ride
Post;</HI> yet, trusting wholly to Inspiration, breaks over Hedges and
Ditches, and never checks his Horse's <HI>Speed,</HI> whether <HI>out</HI> of
the Road, or <HI>in</HI> it.</P>
<P>THIS <HI>Merchant Adventurer</HI> was for en∣grossing Trade to
Himself: And began with firing the Magazines of Those who dealt in the
same Commodity.—One of his first <HI>witty Performances,</HI> was, A <HI>Satire against Wit.</HI>—An Accident befell me, the other Day, that
may furnish him with Matter of Specu∣lation. <PB N="455" REF="464"/> I am very
fond of a <HI>Cat</HI>: And, ever since I lodg'd in <HI>Barbican,</HI> have
delight∣ed in the Society of a Tabby Favourite of my Landlady's Children. But,
it happen'd, a few Days since, that, not being in a Hu∣mour to be so
familiar with her as usual, she open'd one of her Claws, and was pleas'd to
scratch my Leg, with no small Freedom, and Impertinence: Upon which, in
great Wrath, I took her up, by the Tail, and toss'd her out of
Window.—The Cat got no Harm: but I have quite lost her Heart upon it.
And <HI>now,</HI> I may call, coax, and tempt her, as much as I please, she
keeps, always, out out of my Reach: And I dare be positive, I shall never <HI>catch</HI> her, though I were to <HI>live and die in Barbican.</HI></P>
<P>BUT, to go on, with what I propos'd.—After his <HI>Satire
against Wit,</HI> he set forth <HI>his Wit against Satire</HI>; and
publish'd an <HI>Epic Poem,</HI> call'd PRINCE ARTHUR.—The Excellent
Critick, abovenam'd, saw, upon perusing this Piece, that the Gentleman
wanted Skill and Application, in the Art he was bent on practising. He put
himself, there∣fore, to the Trouble of composing, for his Use, a just,
and generous Reprehension, which he intitled, <HI>Remarks upon Prince
Arthur.</HI>—Had the Author been either humble, or wise, enough to make
Advantage by it, This wou'd have serv'd him as a Plan, to build stronger,
for the future; and given a Turn to his Re∣flexion, that might have made him,
him <PB N="456" REF="465"/> what he had so earnest a Desire to pass
for.</P>
<P>BUT it was, then, as it is now, the Cus∣tom to despise a
Critick. And the Author of <HI>Prince Arthur</HI> fell, so couragiously,
into the Fashion, that in almost His Coach-Load of <HI>Epic Poems,</HI>
which he has, since oblig'd the World with, from <HI>Arthur,</HI> down to <HI>Al∣fred,</HI> (I speak it without Compliment) The same
distinguishable Purity, Fire, Elegance, Fancy, Copiousness, and
Elevation, shine, alike, in every one of 'em: And, All, are equally secure,
as well from Criticism, as Imitation.</P>
<P>BUT, not content with raising, and adorn∣ing <HI>Human</HI> Nature,
He aspir'd, at last, to write, upon <HI>Divinity Itself.</HI>—The
Great Almighty, and His <HI>Works,</HI> were, now, to be the Subject of his
practis'd Panegyrick.—Here, sure! if ever, He was to guard himself
with Caution, and put on the Critick's Armour.—<HI>Creation</HI> opened
to him, with its boundless Lustre!—Worlds beyond Worlds, were to be
discover'd, by his Poetic Telescope: And <HI>other Suns,</HI> whose <HI>Light</HI> (tho' swift enough, to travel a Hundred and Fourscore
thousand Miles, in one <HI>Second</HI> of Time, is notwithstanding,
spent, and lost, in unconceivable Immensity, before it reaches, <HI>This,</HI> our own, <HI>Sun</HI>'s Confines!) <HI>This Light</HI> was to be <HI>more Illuminated,</HI> by His Muse, and shine down, upon his Reader's

<P><PB N="457" REF="466"/>HERE, the admirable Critick, his old Friend,
had, Himself, set an Example; such, as can never be too much
applauded.—The noblest, the most extensive, the most
astonishing Ideas, which can expand the Hu∣man Soul, had inrich'd his
powerful Concep∣tion. And one wou'd have hop'd, that Mr. <HI>Dennis</HI> had
made it impossible for any future Writer to treat this Subject, in a mean
and groveling Manner; after he had oblig'd the World, so nobly, in his <HI>Paraphrase on Te Deum,</HI> with Verse, and Sentiments, sub∣limely
suited to the <HI>Vastness</HI> of the Occasion.</P>
<Q> 
<L>Where-e'er, at utmost Stretch, we cast our Eyes,</L> 
<L>Thro' the vast <HI>frightful,</HI> Spaces of the <HI>Skies;</HI></L>

<P><PB N="458" REF="467"/>THIS is Poetry, that defies Censure, and is
rais'd, even above Praise: for it is scarce pos∣sible to say so
much of it, as it truly deserves.—But, now, behold; on the opposite
Side, an Abstract, from the Muse of <HI>Prince Arthur,</HI> in his <HI>Hymn
to the Creator.</HI></P>

<L>Hail, <HI>King Supreme!</HI>—Of <HI>Power,</HI> immense

have sunk, so soon, and so shame∣fully, as to tell us, in the 4th
Verse—That <HI>He, who is Supreme in Power, is controul'd by no
Superior.</HI></P>
<P>ABOUT 20 Lines after this, God goes out with a Pair of Compasses,
to mark the Limits of the World: Not that the Poet had any Design they
should be made use of; but Mr. <HI>Milton</HI> had described <HI>Compasses,</HI> upon this very Occasion: And our Author was
resolv'd to be up with him.</P>
<Q>

<L>Unfinish'd Orbs, and Worlds in Embryo, breed.</L> </Q>
<P><PB N="459" REF="468"/>TO suspend a short Remark, on the
mani∣fest Contradiction of these two Ideas—The <HI>Drawing out with a
Pair of Compasses,</HI>—And the <HI>Begetting,</HI> by <HI>Embraces,</HI>—I challenge the whole Tribe of Critick-Haters
throughout <HI>Europe,</HI> to match this last Image with any thing so
indecent, so improper, so ill-express'd, and, indeed, so almost
blasphe∣mous, and extravgant!</P>
<P>BUT, that no Cause of Complaint may disturb the Lovers of <HI>Variety,</HI> whoever likes not one Image, shall have a Dozen new ones,
to make Choice of.—The Author, to do him Justice, is no Niggard of his

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR Paper of <HI>Friday</HI> the 28th. of <HI>August,</HI> is
arrived in <HI>North-Britain,</HI> and has occasioned much Speculation; but
all its Readers are sensibly obliged, by the <PB N="462" REF="471"/>
Respect you have shewn our Country, and for the Honour you have done the
rising Generation of both Sexes; and I believe, there is none here, who would
not heartily join their Acknowledgements with mine on this Occasion. I may
therefore presume to thank you in the Name of all my Country∣men, who may not
use the Freedom to write to you: But the Gentlemen of the <HI>Grotesque
Club,</HI> whom you have so remark∣ably distinguish'd, must represent
their Sentiments, in a better Manner than I can; and I will not pretend to
speak their Sense, or anticipate their Gratitude.</P>
<P>GIVE me Leave, SIR, only to express my Mind in the Sequel. You
have brought me under strong Obligations to you, by the Notice you have taken
of my Letter. And since you seem to promise to yourself, and the World,
some Intelligence from this Quarter, by means of my propos'd
Correspondence; I cannot but use my En∣deavours, to answer, in some
Measure, your Expectations. You have fix'd me, SIR, in the Character of your <HI>Northern Spy,</HI> and you may depend upon my most watchful Fidelity.</P>
<P><HI>EDINBURGH</HI> being our <HI>Metropolis,</HI> and the Place of
my Residence, must be the chief Scene of Action, and the Date of your
Intelligence from <HI>North-Britain.</HI> Here is a vast Variety of Humours,
Cu∣stoms, Manners, and Conversation, to be <PB N="463" REF="472"/>
considered. Many Things happen in this Place, that are worthy your Knowledge
as a PLAIN-DEALER. Some deserve Praise and Admiration, others
Displeasure and Reprehension; both Regards may be use∣ful, either as
Examples provoking Emula∣tion; or, as Reasons, warning from Dan∣ger: And
sure, your Judgment, SIR, cannot err, in the Improvement and Ap∣plication, of
any Accounts I send you.</P>
<P>I BEG leave to lay before you, several of the Advantages, and
Disadvantages of our good Town, before I descend to Private Life.</P>
<P>WE are blest with an able and active <HI>Magistracy.</HI> Most
of Those intrusted with with the Superintendency of the City, are Gentlemen
of Breeding and Letters, and all have a Bent of Mind, that favours the Publick
Grandeur and Emolument. It seems to be the united Ambition of our
Magistrates to adorn the Place, and by rendring it more beautiful and
commodious, to invite new Inhabitants, to increase its Treasure and
Revenue. They would surmount all the Difficulties it labours under, by a
Superio∣rity of Genius: And, as they appear true Friends to the Publick
Interest, in respect of <HI>Trade</HI>; they are not wanting in giving
Countenance and Encouragement to <HI>Arts</HI> and <HI>Sciences.</HI>
Politeness thrives under their Influence, and some of them set an
Ex∣ample of it to the Youth, in their own <PB N="464" REF="473"/> Practice and
Behaviour. Here, SIR, are few cloudy, heavy-headed Aldermen, whose Length of
Wigs and Gowns, is their sole Mark of Dignity. You would take our <HI>Provosts</HI> for First Ministers, and our <HI>Bailies</HI> for
Courtiers. I have seen <HI>Statesmen,</HI> make a worse Figure than our <HI>Deacons,</HI> and heard as good Speeches in the <HI>Town-Council</HI> at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> as at the Council-Board of <HI>Great-Britain.</HI> I wish
all our <HI>Peers</HI> had Abilities equal to some of our <HI>Weavers,</HI>
and that every <HI>Clergyman,</HI> had half the Grace of some <HI>Bonnet-Makers</HI> of our City.</P>
<P>BUT, SIR, you know there is no <HI>Body-Politick,</HI> perfect; many
Things are wanting, to make our City more flourishing and fam'd. And,
perhaps, the greatest Misfortune we labour under, is Faction and Party. This,
SIR, discourages many noble Purposes, and baffles glorious Undertakings.
Self-Love, Pride and Ambition, prevail every∣where, and sway all Men, more or
less: These are natural to all Creatures. The Oldest Cock is Lord of the
Roost, and the strongest Bull is <HI>Grand Seignior</HI> in his green <HI>Seraglio</HI>; the eldest Buck is Tyrant of the Park, and, from his
Strength and his Horns claims a Right to be Chief in Power; and, no doubt, but
every individual Crea∣ture, of every Species, with the same Force, would
seek and exercise the same Jurisdict∣ion. But Men are remarkably
distinguished, <PB N="465" REF="474"/> by their Love of Precedency, and
often add, to their natural Desire of Governing, a certain low-spirited
Spleen and Malice. Our worthy Magistrates, meet with more Opposition and
Discouragment, from little Pretenders to their Place and Authority, than from
any other Cause. If the Town-Council, beholds not <HI>Macro,</HI> with the
same Partiality, with which he considers himself, he wonders at their
Blindness, and grows <HI>peevish</HI> upon it; for the Root of the Spleen,
is often <HI>Pride disappointed.</HI> Some carry it farther than mere <HI>Envy,</HI> by labouring to undermine and depose those who are above
them, and commonly the greater the Merit is, the more obnoxious to Ill-will and
Re∣proaches. As the <HI>Red Dragon</HI> pursued the Woman in the <HI>Revelation,</HI> Faction or Pri∣vate Malice, pursues the most
deserving Man; and when it cannot overtake him, it opens its Mouth, and <HI>throws a Flood after him</HI>: People who have not Merit to rise
themselves, would at least level others. And what has often been my
greatest Won∣der, in this Case, is, that most of our little Jars, are
created and carried on by our <HI>Clergy.</HI> Priest-Craft is here, as <HI>Infallible</HI> as it is at <HI>Rome,</HI> and our <HI>Popes</HI> are as <HI>abso∣lute,</HI> to the full Extent of their <HI>Parishes.</HI> For my
own Part, I have neither Personal Partiality for any of the present
Magistrates, nor Prejudice against their Adversaries: I never had, nor
ever needed the Favour of any <PB N="466" REF="475"/> of them. I speak my
Sense freely, and it is the Result of just Reflexion, and Ob∣servation.
And I heartily wish, I had not such Ground, to expose the Spirits of any
of my Neighbours, to the <HI>Plain-Dealer.</HI> But what a Pity is it, that
Faction should deface the Publick Good? And how vile, to plot the Downfal, or
calumniate the Fame of Those, whose Power is their Coun∣try's
Blessing?</P>
<P>MY Concern for the Place of my Birth, has carried me farther than I
ought to have allow'd myself Liberty; but as I am not to touch this Subject
again, you will have the Goodness to excuse, what I judg'd, in some
respects, to be requisite.</P>
<P>I SHOULD not neglect giving you an Account of the State of <HI>Trade</HI> in this Place nor ought I to pass over in Silence, the <HI>University</HI> and <HI>College</HI> of <HI>Justices.</HI> Many of the <HI>Clergy</HI> too, deserve their Praises, and must, upon some
Occasions, come under Consideration: But being unwilling to tire your
Patience, and huddle my Materials too much together, I will conclude this
Letter, when I have acquainted you with what the <HI>Ladies</HI> would have <HI>most known,</HI> and what every Body here would be glad to have your
Opinion of: I mean, The FAIR ASSEMBLY. This, SIR, consists of our
best-bred Ladies, of different Qualities and Ages: 'Tis but a late
Institution, and at first, was thought to be a proper Theme 
<PB N="467" REF="476"/> for our <HI>Pastors Sunday</HI> Sermons; all our
Pulpits rail'd against it, as they did, of Old, against <HI>Perukes</HI>
and <HI>Tobacco.</HI> But the holy Fire is now much spent, and we are at
Liberty to meet in our great Hall, without Danger of the <HI>Kirk</HI>'s <HI>Anathema</HI>; nay, some of the Wives and Daughters of the <HI>Sanctified,</HI> begin of late, to grace our Fellowship. For my own Part,
I despair not to see the <HI>Reverend</HI> themselves, eating Sweatmeats
in our Company: And mixing innocently, in our Country Dances. And I own,
notwithstanding they are worthy Ladies, of undisputed Virtue and Honour,
who preside over the <HI>Fair Assembly,</HI> I should be better
pleased to see at our Head, a <HI>Moderator</HI> from the <HI>General
One.</HI> Slander and Detraction would fly before him, and innocent Freedom,
and Christian Commu∣nion wou'd be cherished by his Influence. Husbands
would allow their Wives to go into Company, without Jealousy, and Parants
send their Daughters, without fear of their leaving behind them any thing,
that they ought to bring back again. But till that <HI>Halcyon</HI> Day
arrives, we must be contented with the want of <HI>Sanction,</HI> and dance,
and drink Tea without them. I shall say more of our <HI>Fair
Assembly</HI> hereafter, and at pre∣sent only subscribe myself,</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Sept.</HI> 21. 1724.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I RETURN you Thanks for the Pleasure which I have received from
several of your <HI>Plain Dealers,</HI> and particularly from that which you
lately published concerning <HI>Detraction,</HI> which could never have
obliged the World at a more seasonable Juncture; because, as you justly
observe, Slander was never so prevailing, as 'tis at present, and never
so insupportable.</P>
<P><HI>DETRACTION,</HI> or <HI>Slander,</HI> or <HI>Calumny,</HI> call
it by what Name you please, is, for the most part, begot by <HI>Knaves,</HI> and nou∣rish'd, and maintain'd, by <HI>Fools</HI>; and the 
<PB N="469" REF="478"/> more Fools and Knaves, there are, in a Nation, the more
must Slander flourish in it; but the more corrupt and degenerate a Nation
grows, the more Fools and Knaves must abound in it. Now, whether this Nation
was ever so corrupt and degenerate, as it is at present, I leave to others
to de∣termine.</P>
<P>THE Fools, and Knaves, of either Sex, have a natural Aversion to <HI>Merit,</HI> and when they are neither able, nor willing, to reach a Height,
to which others, more befriended by Nature, and more beloved by Heaven, have
attained, they constantly endeavour, with all their Might, to bring the
envied Object down to their own Pitch: And, the more extraordinary the <HI>Merit</HI> is, the greater is the <HI>Envy,</HI> and the stronger the
Efforts, which it makes, to blacken the Deserving: Which has occasioned a
famous Observer of Mankind to say, That when∣ever he <HI>hears</HI> a great
deal of <HI>Ill</HI> said of any one, and sees none at all in him, he
be∣gins to suspect, that <HI>That</HI> Person has a troublesome and
offensive <HI>Merit,</HI> which eclipses that of others.</P>
<P>AS soon as a Knave has invented a Slander, a Fool cries out, <HI>There must be something in it,—There is no Smoak</HI> with∣out <HI>Fire</HI>: Which is as much as to say, that there can be no such Thing
as <HI>Slander</HI>; or, that no Slander can be <HI>propagated</HI>; which is
equally contrary to common Sense, and <PB N="470" REF="479"/> to constant
Matter of Fact.—How different an Opinion of this Matter, had the
judicious, and penetrating, <HI>La Bruyere,</HI> who tells us, That <HI>the
Reverse of what is commonly reported, concerning Persons, or Things, is
what may reasonably be believ'd of either.</HI></P>
<P>THERE is another musty Proverb, made use of in the Propagation
of <HI>Slander,</HI> which is mention'd in your last Paper, <HI>viz. That,
what Every-Body says, must be true.</HI>—If they, who pronounce <HI>this,</HI> meant, that <HI>Every thing must be True which has the
univer∣sal Consent of Mankind,</HI> there might, per∣haps, be something
in it; but, alas! their Meaning is vastly different: They only in∣fer, That <HI>when a Report, or Opinion, in any Place, so far prevails, as to become,
in that Place, general, that Report, or Opinion, must be true.</HI> So that,
in the Notion of these Gentlemen, If Calumny, at any Time, so far prevails,
as to become <HI>General,</HI> 'tis no longer <HI>Calumny,</HI> but <HI>Truth</HI>; and a sure Consequence of this Doctrine is, That <HI>Popery</HI> is the <HI>best</HI> Religion at <HI>Rome,</HI> and <HI>Mahometism</HI> at <HI>Constantinople.</HI></P>
<P>BUT, how little do they, who talk, at this Rate, know, either of the
Frailty, or Malignity, of Human Nature, or the Transactions of their own
Times, or the Records of preceding ones? Some of the best, and most
deserving Persons, both among Ancients, and Moderns, have labour'd 
<PB N="471" REF="480"/> under general Calumny; under Calumnies which were not
only inconsistent with com∣mon Sense, but were directly contradictory of
those Virtues, and great Qualities, for which they had long been eminent, and
for which some of them have been celebrated, by <HI>Twenty succeeding
Centuries;</HI> and tho' the Truth was so manifestly on their Side, yet
some of these, and those of the <HI>most deserving,</HI> have been
quite <HI>oppress'd</HI> by such Calumnies; as <HI>Socrates,</HI> and <HI>Phocion,</HI> a∣mong the <HI>Graecians.</HI>—Among the <HI>Ro∣mans,
Camillus,</HI> and <HI>Coriolanus.</HI>—<HI>SOCRATES,</HI> the most
Religious, and most Virtuous, of all the <HI>Athenians,</HI> was con∣demn'd,
and excuted, as an <HI>Atheist,</HI> and a <HI>Corrupter of Youth.</HI> Among
the <HI>Jews,</HI> the Prophets were <HI>ston'd,</HI> and <HI>Jesus
Christ,</HI> Himself, was crucify'd as an <HI>Imposter,</HI> and a <HI>Blasphemer.</HI></P>
<P>YOU have, very justly observ'd, That Detraction brings most
Disquiet, to those who are most above it.—You may say such
Things, without any Consequence, to a worthless Fellow, as will blow a Man
of Honour into a Flame, not to be quench'd, but by Blood. But, if such
Injuries are so insupportable, to a Man of Honour, when they come from one
single Person, provok'd, perhaps, by some ima∣ginary Offence, and quite
frantick, with Passion, and Wine; what Impressions must they not
make, when they are whisper'd <PB N="472" REF="481"/> in cold Blood, by a
Number of different Persons? Such Slanders obstruct the Pro∣gress of
Arts, the Advancement of Learn∣ing, and the Growth of Virtues, by the killing
Impressions, which they make, on Individuals.—I wish you would
proceed to show, what Disorder they bring to Families and what Desolation
to States. <HI>Hannibal</HI> was undone, and <HI>Carthage</HI> was ruin'd, by
the malicious <HI>Slanders</HI> of <HI>Hanno</HI>; and the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI>'s unparallel'd Victories cou'd not defend him against
Ingratitude, while the Malice of his Slanderers met with Countenance from Men
in <HI>Power,</HI> who, being, privately, his Enemies, had not <HI>Soul</HI>
enough to sacrifice their <HI>little Spleen</HI> to the Love of their <HI>Country</HI>'s <HI>Glory.</HI></P>

<P><HI>DETRACTION</HI> is an Evil, which, how∣ever hateful in its Nature,
the World must always expect to abound with. And, there∣fore, since my
Correspondent has written so much, and so well, in Detestation of this
un∣generous Weakness, all I will add, upon the Subject, shall be, to
advise those who suffer under the Severity of its Consequences, rather
to <HI>despise,</HI> than <HI>complain of</HI> it. To which End, they wou'd
do well to reflect on <PB N="473" REF="482"/> the Answer of the Philosopher,
whom his Friends were urging to contrive some publick Means, whereby to
redeem himself from the Disgrace which he suffer'd, under the Malice of
some busy Slanderers.—<HI>They who love me,</HI> said he, <HI>will
give no Credit to malicious Rumours, to my Disadvantage: And, as for those
who hate me, I will live, in a Manner so contrary to what they believe of me,
that I will make 'em asham'd of their Credulity.</HI></P>
<P>THAT very <HI>Socrates,</HI> which my Correspond∣ent so justly
produces, as one of the most glorious of all the <HI>Victims</HI> to <HI>Slander,</HI> triumph'd over it, in the very Current and full Force, of its
Influence. For when <HI>Aristophanes,</HI> in his Comedy, call'd, The <HI>Clouds,</HI> had expos'd this great, and virtuous Sufferer, with the
utmost Bitterness of <HI>witty Malice,</HI> to the publick Spleen of the <HI>Athenians, Socrates</HI> came, in Person, to see the Comedy acted; and,
taking his Place in the most remarkable Part of the Theatre, stood up, and
exposing himself to the Observation of the whole Audience, told 'em,
aloud, when the Play was over, that, <HI>They had been at a merry Feast,
where He was serv'd up, for their En∣tertainment; nor was he angry, to have
been their standing Dish, because the Aversion which some had brought
with them, wou'd last no longer than till they had tasted him.</HI></P>
<P>SINCE it is inseparable from Merit, to be expos'd to <HI>Envy,</HI>
and Envy necessarily produces <HI>Slander,</HI> there is no hoping to live 
<PB N="474" REF="483"/> free, from the Effects of this pernicious <HI>Calumny.</HI> But, next to not feeling it the most desirable Strength
of Mind, is, <HI>Not to appear to feel it.</HI>—One of these is out of
our Reach; the other we may attain, by Force of Reason, and Resolution: And
its prettily observ'd, in <HI>Aelian,</HI> (asserting that Defamation
sinks deepest in weak Natures) <HI>The Slander of the</HI> Strong <HI>is
like Water thrown against a Wall; but the Slander of the</HI> Weak <HI>is
like the Wall thrown into Water.</HI></P>

<P>I HAVE lately received a Letter con∣taining some Remarks on the
Battle of the Angels, as 'tis describ'd by <HI>Milton</HI> in the VIth Book
of his <HI>Paradise Lost,</HI> and I thought I could not find a more proper
Occasion of publishing that Letter, than just after the Feast of St. <HI>Michael,</HI> on the 29th of the last Month, which was set apart by the
Church to celebrate the Victory which that Arch-Angel got over <HI>Lucifer,</HI> and his rebellious Crew. I make no Doubt, but it will
ap∣pear, <PB N="476" REF="485"/> that <HI>Milton,</HI> by the Account which he
has given of that Victory, has gained a very glorious one himself, and has
carried away the Praise of Sublimity from all Poets, both Antient and
Modern.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>OF all the Commentators on the <HI>Pa∣radise Lost,</HI> Mr. <HI>Addison</HI> was certainly the most ingenious, if he was not the most
learned; but he has not given <HI>Milton</HI> his full Due, either through want
of Discern∣ment, or want of Impartiality. In the 17th Page of the small
Edition of his Notes upon the <HI>Paradise Lost,</HI> he has these Words
of the Author:</P>
<Q><HI>MILTON's</HI> chief Talent, and, indeed, his distinguishing
Excellence, lies in the Sub∣limity of his Thoughts. There are others of the
Moderns who rival him in every other Part of Poetry; but in the Greatness of
his Sentiments he triumphs over all the Poets, both Moderns and Antients, <HI>Homer</HI> only excepted.</Q>
<P>BUT as when a Man departs from Truth, which is the only Bond of
Union and Agreement, both of our Sentiments with those of others, and of our
Sentiments with themselves, he his ready immediately to differ from, and to
grow inconsistent with himself; Mr. <HI>Addison,</HI> who expresly 
<PB N="477" REF="486"/> here either equals or prefers <HI>Homer,</HI> for the
Greatness of his Sentiments, before <HI>Milton,</HI> contradicts himself at
least, no less than twice in the Course of his Observations: For,
says he, in the 7th Page of the fore∣said Edition, <HI>There is an
indisputable and un∣questioned Magnificence in every Part of</HI>
Pa∣radise Lost, <HI>and, indeed, a much greater than could have been formed
upon any</HI> Pagan <HI>System.</HI> Now if there is a greater Magni∣ficence
in every Part of <HI>Milton</HI>'s Poem, there is by Consequence a greater
Sublimity, than there is in the <HI>Iliad,</HI> which was form∣ed upon a <HI>Pagan</HI> System.</P>
<P>AGAIN in the 92d Page of the foresaid Edition, Mr. <HI>Addison,</HI> speaking of the Excellence of <HI>Milton</HI>'s
Performance in the Sixth Book of his Poem, delivers him∣self thus:</P>
<Q><HI>MILTON's</HI> Genius, which was so great in itself, and so
strengthened by all the Helps of Learning, appears in this Book every way
equal to his Subject, which is the most sublime that could enter into the
Thoughts of a Poet.</Q>
<P>NOW, SIR, if <HI>Milton</HI>'s Subject is the most sublime that
could enter into the Thoughts of a Poet, and his Genius is every way equal to
his Subject, it follows, That <HI>Milton</HI> is more exalted than any Poet who
has not a Subject so elevated, and, consequently, than <HI>Homer,</HI> or
any other Poet antient or modern.</P>
<P><PB N="478" REF="487"/> BUT, as in the 91st Page of the foresaid
Comment, Mr. <HI>Addison</HI> takes a great deal of Pains to shew the
Greatness of one par∣ticular Passage of <HI>Homer,</HI> and to describe
it, after <HI>Longinus,</HI> in all those chosen Cir∣cumstances, which
may make it appear to be noble and exalted, which Pains he has not taken with
any other Passage, we may rea∣sonably conclude, that he believed this to
be the most lofty of any that are in the Works of <HI>Homer,</HI> as indeed
it really is: Now, as there is a Passage in the 6th Book of <HI>Paradise
Lost,</HI> which was produced upon a parallel Occasion, let us see if we
cannot find by comparing them, for the Honour of our Country, that the
Passage, of our <HI>Briton,</HI> is as much superior to that of the <HI>Grecian,</HI> as the Angels of the one are more potent than the other's
Gods, or as the <HI>Em∣pyrean</HI> Heaven is more exalted than <HI>Ossa,
Pelion,</HI> or <HI>Olympus.</HI></P>
<P>IN order to this, SIR, give me leave to lay before you the Words
which Mr. <HI>Addison</HI> makes Use of to set sorth the masterly
Strokes of <HI>Homer.</HI> After he has told us, That there is no Question,
but that <HI>Milton</HI> had heated his Imagination with the Fight of the Gods
in <HI>Homer,</HI> before he entered upon the En∣gagement of the Angels (of
which, by the Way, I do not believe one Syllable: I would sooner believe the
greatest Absurdities of the <HI>Alcoran</HI>) he is pleased to add what
follows:</P>
<Q><PB N="479" REF="488"/><HI>HOMER</HI> there gives us a Scene of Men,
Heroes, and Gods, mixed together in Battle. <HI>Mars</HI> animates the
contending Armies, and lifts up his Voice in such a Manner, that it is heard
distinctly amidst all the Shouts and Confusion of the Fight. <HI>Jupiter</HI> at the same Time thunders over their Heads; while <HI>Nep∣tune</HI> raises such a Tempest, that the whole Field of Battle,
and all the Tops of the Mountains, shake about them. The Poet tells us, That <HI>Pluto</HI> himself, whose Habitation was in the very Center of the
Earth, was so affrighted at the Shock, that he leap'd from his Throne. <HI>Homer</HI> afterwards describes <HI>Vulcan,</HI> as pouring down a Storm
of Fire upon the River <HI>Xanthus;</HI> and <HI>Minerva,</HI> as throwing a
Rock at <HI>Mars,</HI> who he tells us covered Seven Acres in his Fall.</Q>
<P>WITH these imaginary <HI>ne plus ultra's</HI> had Mr. <HI>Addison</HI> so filled his Capacity, that when Ten thousand greater
Beauties are be∣fore his Eyes, he stops short of them, and never in the
least discerns them, as you will see immediately; for thus he goes
on:</P>
<Q>AS <HI>Homer</HI> has introduced into his Battle of the Gods every
Thing that is great and ter∣rible in Nature, <HI>Milton</HI> has filled his
Fight af good and bad Angels, with all the like Cir∣cumstances of Horror. The
Shout of Armies, the Rattling of brazen Chariots, the Hurling of Rocks and
Mountains, the Earthquake, the Fire, <PB N="480" REF="489"/> the Thunder, are
all of them imployed to lift up the Reader's Imagination, and give him a
suitable Idea of so great an Action. With what Art doth the Poet
represent the whole Body of the Earth trembling, even before it was
created?</Q>
<P>THUS, with this very pretty trifling Re∣mark, does Mr. <HI>Addison</HI> stop short, within the very Touch of one of the
vastest, and the sublimest Beauties, that ever was in∣spired by the
God of Verse, or by <HI>Milton</HI>'s Godlike Genius; when the very next
Lines, the very next Words, strike and astonish us with such wonderful
Ideas, as are able to lift up the Reader's Imagination to a Thousand Times a
greater Height, than either the Shout of Armies, the Rattling of brazen
Chariots, the Hurling of Rocks and Moun∣tains, the Earthquake, the Fire, or the
Thunder. But that these Beauties may be seen in all their Lustre, and in
all their Glory, give me leave to set the whole Passage before you.</P>
<Q> 
<L>Th' Arch-Angel's Trumpet through the Vast of Heav'n</L> 
<L>Resounded, and the faithful Armies rung</L> 
<L>Hosanna to the Highest: nor stood at gaze</L> 
<L>The adverse Legions, nor less hideous join'd</L> 
<L>The horrid Shock; now storming Fury rose,</L> 
<L>And Clamour, such as heard in Heav'n till now</L> 
<L>Was never; Arms on Armour clashing, bray'd</L> 
<L>Horrible Discord, and the madding Wheels</L> 
<L><PB N="481" REF="490"/>Of brazen Chariots rag'd; Dire was the
Noise</L> 
<L>Of Conflict: Over-head the dismal Hiss</L> 
<L>Of fiery Darts, in flaming Vollies, flew,</L> 
<L>And, flying, vaulted either Host with Fire.</L> 
<L>So, under fiery Cope, together rush'd</L> 
<L>Both Battles main, with ruinous Assault,</L> 
<L>And inextinguishable Rage: All Heav'n</L> 
<L>Resounded; and had Earth been then, all Earth</L> 
<L>Had to her Center shook: What Wonder! when</L> 
<L>Millions of fierce encountring Angels fought</L> 
<L>On either Side, the least of whom could wield</L> 
<L>These Elements, and arm him with the Force</L> 
<L>Of all the Regions?</L> </Q>
<P>BUT now, Sir, if Millions of fierce encountring Angels fought on
either Side, and the very least, the very weakest of so many Millions,
had Power to rend this Globe of Earth and Ocean from its Axle, and whirl it,
with its dependent Atmo∣sphere, through the Aethereal Regions, what must be
the unutterable, the inconceivable Effect of so many Millions furiously
con∣tending against each other, and each of them exerting all his Might for
Victory? When, 
<Q> 
<L>— Each on himself relied,</L> 
<L>As only on His Arm the Moment lay</L> 
<L>Of Victory.</L> </Q></P>
<P>THESE are amazing, these are astonish∣ing Ideas, worthy of the
great Original Fight, the Battle of the <HI>Empyrean.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="482" REF="491"/> BUT now, Sir, if the least, if the
weakest of so many Millions, as fought on either Side, had Strength to
remove this Globe of Earth, with its dependent Ele∣ments, what could not the
greatest of them? what could not <HI>Lucifer</HI>? what could not the Prince
of the Arch-Angels, <HI>Michael</HI>'s next-to-Almighty Arm, do? The follow∣ing
Lines, and our own Reflections on them may a little help to inform us.</P>
<Q> 
<L>— Long time in even Scale</L> 
<L>The Battle hung, till Satan, who, that Day,</L> 
<L>Prodigious Pow'r had shewn, and met in Arms</L> 
<L>No Equal, ranging through the dire Attack</L> 
<L>Of fighting Seraphim confus'd, at length</L> 
<L>Saw where the Sword of <HI>Michael</HI> smote, and fell'd</L> 
<L>Squadrons, at once.</L> </Q>
<P>BUT, now, Sir, of whom were these Squadrons? Why, 
<Q> 
<L>Squadrons of those the least of whom could wield</L> 
<L>These Elements, and arm him with the Force</L> 
<L>Of all their Regions.</L> </Q></P>
<P>WHAT must the Power of that Arch-Angel be, who, with one Stroke of
his Sword, could fell whole Squadrons of those, 
<Q> 
<L>The least of whom could wield these Elements,</L> 
<L>And arm him with the Force of all their Regions?</L> </Q> </P>
