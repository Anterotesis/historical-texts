THE CITY OF CARLISLE.</HEAD>
<P>THE traveller approaching from the south, has the best view of the city, seat∣ed on a fine eminence, gradually emerging from an extensive plain of rich cultivated land. The waters of the Frith are seen on the one hand, with the ad∣jacent levells; the back ground of the landscape is beautifully variegated by the irregular swells of the whole Scotch promontory, extending towards the Irish sea. The walls strengthened with an arrangement of buttresses at irregular distances, lies upon one angle to the view; in part, concealing the houses of the city, and boldly overtoped by the square tower of the castle, and the august and solemn structure of the cathedral. This view of Carlisle is the more striking, as there is no adjacent eminence; from which cause the city looks more majestic, as it crowns so beautiful a plain.</P>
<P>The city is walled round, the fortifications towards Scotland appearing the most modern; they are formed of better squared stones than several other parts of the works. The east and south sides are supported by a multitude of buttresses, which, we presume, have been built up occasionally, to strengthen the decaying parts of the wall. It is watered by three fine rivers, the Eden on the north, the Peterill on the east, and Caude on the west. There are three gates to the city, which, from their different aspects, are called the English, Irish, and Scotch Gates. On
<PB N="4" REF="6"/>the approach from Penrith, on the south, you enter the English Gates; on the ap∣proach from Wigton, on the south-west, is the Irish Gate; and the Scotch Gate, to the north, opens upon the bridges. The walls are embrazured, but without any earth-work. The English Gate is guarded by a very strong machicolated gate, flanked by circular towers of great strength; the guns mounted therein in several tiers, would effectually sweep every approach. This gateway, with its towers and other works, is commonly called the Citadel,
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">"An oblong with three round bastions."—PENNANT.—The ancient entrance into the city was through the citadel.</NOTE> and was erected by the order of King Henry VIII. The castle consists of various works, but being kept up as a garrisoned place, we conceive it imprudent to describe them minutely.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>There were several officers appointed to this fortress, viz. a governor, deputy governor, town-major, engineer, barrack-master, store-keeper, head gunner, three quarter gunners, and a person to buy in and deliver out coals and candles to the garrison. For many years, prior to 1761, the governor of this city was chosen from one of the representatives in parliament; and most of the subordinate places in the gar∣rison were given to the freemen of the city, and generally members of the corporation, so that frequently the chief magistrate was a quarter gunner.—L. [For a list of the governors see page 595.</P></NOTE> The donjon, or great tower, more properly deserves the title of the citadel, being surrounded by the other works; it is square and very lofty, and the walls of vast strength and thickness, being constructed agreeably to the old modes of defence, before the use of cannon: it was strengthened by a draw bridge over a wide ditch, and defended by modern works; a half-moon battery mounted with cannon, and a very large platform also mounted with cannon, under cover of the outward wall. The top of the tower being embrazured and lined with turf, and mounted with large cannon, this part of the fortress could make a good defence, and sustain a formidable attack. By a well of vast depth constructed within the great tower, and said to be of Roman work, the supply of water for the garrison could not be cut off by an enemy. This well is not unlike that in Bambrough Castle in Nor∣thumberland, and has been constructed at the same time the great tower was built.
<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><P>In the gates of the castle, is still remaining the old Portcullis: and here are shewn the apartments of Mary, Queen of Scots, where she was lodged some time after her landing at Workington; and after being, for a little space, entertained with flattering respect, found herself prisoner to her jealous rival.</P></NOTE> In the outer castle is a fine grass plot, a garden and governor's house.</P>
<P>But it will be expected by our readers, that we give a more particular descrip∣tion of this city, and collect the historical facts relative to it.</P>
<P>The name of Carlisle has been deduced by several authors, from different ety∣mologies. The British chronicle informs us, this city was built by a British potentate, called Luel. Leland says, <Q>the Irishmen call <HI>bale</HI> a town, and so peradventure did the old Scottes: thus might be said that <HI>lugabalia</HI> soundeth <HI>Luel's-town.</HI></Q>
<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot"><P>Lel. Itin. v. vii. p. 48.—In Leland's Collectaniae, vol. ii. p. 19. Extract from the 14th chapter, of the 1st book of Galfridus, <Q>Qui ut properitate regni usus est, in Aquilonari parte Britanniae civitatem aedificavit, quam de nomine ejus Caer-leil vocant.</Q> Leil alias Luel, filius Bruti. cog. viridis scuti, condidit Caerliel.</P></NOTE> The Romans called it <HI>Lugovallium,</HI> or <HI>Luguballum,</HI> from its si∣tuation on Severus' wall, and from the troops and people garrisoned there. <HI>Ptolemy</HI> calls it <HI>Leucopibi, Nennius Caer Lualid.</HI> The Saxons retained the old name <HI>Luel;</HI> the Welsh writers give it the name of the city of <HI>Duballus.</HI> Some derive the name
<PB N="5" REF="7"/>from the ancient British <HI>Llu-gyda-gwal,</HI> which implies <HI>an army by the wall;</HI> from whence it is asserted the Romans framed their appellation of <HI>Lugovallium;</HI> others from <HI>Lagus,</HI> or <HI>Lucus,</HI> which, in the language of the <HI>Celtae</HI> and Britains, signified a tower; and which, with the Roman compound, expressed <HI>a tower or fort upon the wall or vallum:</HI> to the Saxon name was added, the word <HI>caer,</HI> or city; and from these, <HI>Caer Leuel,</HI> the present name of <HI>Car-lisle,</HI> seems to come by an easy corrup∣tion. It is reasonable to apprehend, that in so fine a situation, on the confluence of three rivers, and the grand estuarie of the Frith, this place was of some strength and distinction before the coming of the Romans: it will naturally follow, that the name was given antecedent to the building of Severus' wall, or the vallum of Hadrian; and we conceive that Leland points out the most probable etymology. <HI>Camden</HI> and his editors have taken great pains on this subject, <Q>The Romans and Britains called it <HI>Luguvallum</HI> and <HI>Luguballium,</HI> or <HI>Luguballia;</HI> the Saxons, as <HI>Bede</HI> writeth, <HI>Luel; Ptolemy,</HI> as some think, <HI>Lucopibia,</HI> (which seems rather to be a corruption of <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>i. e.</HI> white houses, and to be <HI>Candida Casa,</HI> or <HI>Whithorn</HI> in <HI>Galloway</HI>) <HI>Nemicus Caer Lualid;</HI> the ridiculous Welsh prophecies, <HI>the city of Duballus;</HI> we <HI>Carlisle;</HI> and the Latins, from the more modern name, <HI>Carleolum.</HI> For that <HI>Luguballia</HI> and Carlisle are the same, is universally agreed by our historians. But as to the etymology, what pains has our countryman, <HI>Leland,</HI> taken about it, and at last he is driven upon this shift, that <HI>Ituna</HI> might be called <HI>Lugas,</HI> and that <HI>Ballum</HI> came from <HI>Vallis,</HI> a valley, and so make <HI>Lugu∣vallum,</HI> as much as a <HI>valley</HI> upon the <HI>Luge.</HI> But to give my conjectures also, I dare affirm, that the <HI>vallum</HI> and <HI>valia</HI> were derived from that famous military <HI>vallum</HI> of the <HI>Romans,</HI> which runs hard by the city. For <HI>Antoninus</HI> calls <HI>Lugu∣vallum ad vallum;</HI> and the Picts wall, which was afterwards built on the wall of <HI>Severus,</HI> is to be seen at Stanwicks, a small village a little beyond the Eden. It passed the river over against the castle; where, in the very channel, the remains of it, namely, great stones appear to this day. Also, <HI>Pomponius Mela</HI> has told us, that <HI>lugus</HI> or <HI>lucus</HI> signified a <HI>tower</HI> among the old <HI>Celtae,</HI> who spoke the same language with the Britains; for what <HI>Antoninus</HI> calls <HI>lugo augusti,</HI> is in him <HI>turris augusti;</HI> so that <HI>luguvallum,</HI> both really is, and signifies <HI>a tower or fort upon the wall or vallum.</HI> Upon this foundation, if the French had made their <HI>lugdunum</HI> signify a tower upon a hill, and their <HI>lucotetia</HI> (so the ancients called what we call <HI>lutetia</HI>) a beautiful tower; for the words import so much in the British, they might possibly have been more in the right, than by deriving the latter from <HI>lutum,</HI> dirt; and the former from one <HI>Lugdus,</HI> a fabulous king. As to the present name, <HI>Carlisle,</HI> the original of this is plain enough, from the British, <HI>caer,</HI> a city; and <HI>Lual, Luel, Lugubal, Leil,</HI> or <HI>Luil,</HI> according to the several appella∣tions, antient or modern, importing as much as <HI>the town or city of Luul,</HI> &amp;c.</Q>
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>Mr. Gough's additions are, "Dr. Gale derives it from <HI>lle,</HI> an army; and <HI>gual,</HI> the wall; as <HI>lugdu∣num</HI> from <HI>llu;</HI> and <HI>dun,</HI> a hill; for Tacitus says, the Lyonnois called themselves a Roman colony, and part of the army. Lugo Augusti in mela, is Turris Augusti. The Saxon Chronicle says, that Rufus, after placing a garrison here, returned into the south, and sent hither Myccle <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, which Bishop Gibson, in his edition of the Chronicle, had translated a great multitude of English; but in his Camden, proposes reading <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>q. d.</HI> husbandmen, as better agreeing with the <HI>tillage</HI> there mentioned, and all the records ascribe the first improvement of the country to this colony.</P>
<P>In Dr. Todd's MS. we have several quotations, relative to the etymology of the name, from Itin. Antiron. Ptolemy's Geog, Bede, &amp;c. which are comprised in what is set forth in the text.</P></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="8"/>It has been the opinion of several judicious visitants, that the river Eden has shifted its course and channel since the time of the Romans, and that formerly it passed nearer to the castle; for it should seem an inconsistent task for that wise people, to make their work traverse a rapid and broad river, otherwise than in a direct line. Both Mr. Horsley, and Mr. Warburton join in this opinion.</P>
<P>It may safely be determined, that the Romans found this a place of some im∣portance; but that it was, in their time, rather a place of recess after the toils of warfare were over, than a place of chief strength, appears from the vicinity of Stanwix, the station in course upon the wall. It is not to be doubted, but Caer-Luel was fortified, as it lay too near the borders not to be subject to perils and alarms; but we have no Roman authorities, to denominate it a regular Roman city or station; as we find those nearest to the wall, on the south, were Olenacum, now called Old Carlifle, near Wigton; and Bremetenracum, called old Perith. The words of Camden and his editors are, <Q>That this city flourished in the time of the Romans, appears plainly enough from the several evidences of antiquity, which they now and then dig up; and from the frequent mention made of it, by the writers of those times. And even after the ravages of the Picts and Scots, it retained something of its ancient splendor, and was accounted a city.</Q>
<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>That it was a place of strength in the time of the Romans, is evident; not only from the men∣tion of it, in the accounts they took of Britain, when they had made it a province of the empire but also from Roman mounments, and inscriptions that have been some time dug up here; one whereof is mentioned by Malmsbury, p. 258. to have been discovered in the time of William Rufus.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Hector Bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, if any credit may be given to him, relates, that Voada, Queen of the Britons, with the assistance of one Colledus, King of the Scotts, and Caractacus, King of the Picts, once upon a time destroyed the Roman provinces; and that the Silures joined with them: that, in the engagement, b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nt Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lessium, the strongest city of the Britons, killing the citizens, and razing the very foundations. That Maximius, a noble Roman, married her daughter, and called the neighbouring country, West Maria, from his own name; so that, if this story be true, the foresaid monument may have been erected for him.</Q>—Dr. TODD'S MS.</P></NOTE></P>
<P>We have no authority to determine what was the size or form of this place in distant antiquity. Leland says in his Itinerary, vol. VII. p. 48. <Q>The hole site of the towne, is sore chaungid.q For whereas the stretes were, and great edifices, now be vacant and garden plottes. The cite of Cairluel stondeth in the forest of Ynglewood. The cite ys yn compace scant a myle, and ys walled with a right fayre and stronge wal, <HI>ex lapide quadrato subrufo.</HI> In diggyng to make new buildyngs yn the towne, often tymes hath bene, and now alate fownd diverse foundations of the old cite, as pavimentes of stretes, old arches of dores, coyne, stones squared, paynted pottes, mony hid yn pottes, so hold and mauldid, that when yt was stronly touchid yt went almost to mowlder.</Q> Page 49, <Q>In the feldes about Caerluel, yn plewhyng hath be fownd diverse Cornelines, and other stonys wel entaylid for seals, and yn other places of Cumberland yn plewhyng hath be fownde brickes conteynyng the prints of antique workes.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="9"/>After the retreat of the Romans, we may naturally conceive, this city would soon be evacuated by the Britons, and destroyed and laid waste by the northern nations, who made constant irruptions, and at length extended their rapine and devastation into the southern, and interior parts of Britain, till repressed by the coming in of the Saxon allies. It would even be a considerable time after their introduction, before they could extend their arms to these western parts. During this period, and in the darkness in which the history of those ages is involved, we are left to conjecture, that this now flourishing city lay in ashes and ruin, till ******* Egfrid possessing the diadem of Northumbria, carried his conquest to the western ocean. The Britons in this mountainous country, long retained their natural ferocity, and supported their uncivilized liberty and independance. Egfrid had Cumberland as a tributary province of his kingdom; and from that period we gain some degree of certainty in the history of this place.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>Bede says, that Northumberland and the Picts, Scotts, and Britons, in the northern parts, were in perfect peace, one with another, in the year of God 731; and that there was such respect and re∣verence given to religion, that persons of the best quality desired to be admitted to the offices of the church: but not long after this, the Britons or Cumbees, who had been scattered in these parts ever since the recess of the Roman legions, began to unite themselves under a government of their own, cal∣ling their province or kingdom, <HI>Cumberland,</HI> or the land of the Cumbri.<BIBL>—Dr. TODD'S MS.</BIBL></Q></NOTE></P>
<P>The first certain account we have of Carlisle, is in the seventh century of the Christian aera. It appears, that in Egfrid's reign, it became a place of consider∣able strength and consequence; he having caused it to be rebuilt, and fortified with a wall.
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">He is also said, "to have repaired the church, restored divine worship, and placed in it a college of secular priests."—GENT. MAG. 1745, p. 674.</NOTE> Camden says, <Q>in 619, Egfrid, King of Northumberland, gave it to the famous St. Cuthbert, in these words: <HI>I have likewise bestowed upon him the city called Luguballia, with the lands fifteen miles about it,</HI></Q> and quotes Symeon Dunelm. This is a palpable error, for Cuthbert's consecration was in 685. The words of Symeon are, <Q>Et quia illa terra minus sufficiens erat, Lugubaliam que Luel vocatur, in circuita xv. miliaria habentum in augmentum suscepit; ubi etiam sanctimonialium congregatione stabilita. Reginam dato habitu religionis consecravit, et inprofectu divinae servitutis scolas instituit.</Q>
<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Vide vol. II. of Northumberland, p. 150. the grant at length, dated 685, Lel. Col. v. I. p. 369.</NOTE> Bede says, the citizens carried Cuthbert to see the walls of their city, and a well of admirable workmanship, built in it by the Romans. <Q>Several writers of St. Cuthbert's life, tell us of that holy man's founding here, A. D. 686, a convent of monks, a school, and an abbey of nuns; but from Bede's Life of St. Cuthbert, cap. 27. it seems as if the monastery here, to which Queen Emenburga retired, was in be∣ing before St. Cuthbert's coming to Carlisle.</Q></P>
<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot"><P>"In the north-west corner of the Forest of Englewood, stands the ancient city of Carlisle. It lay waste for the most part of 200 years before the Conquest, saving a few cottages among the ruins, inha∣bited by Irish and Scots. After the Danes had wasted the country with sire and sword, William Rufus returning that way from Alnwick, when he had made peace with the King of Scotland, seeing the place to be of strength, convenient to entertain his forces at any time, against Scotland, commanded the same to be rectified, and to be fortified with walls and with a castle. This was about the latter end of his reign, but he was prevented by an untimely death, before he could perform all that which he intended, for the good of the city: yet he placed there a colony of Dutchmen, which were shortly thence trans∣lated into the Isle of Anglesey, by him or his next successor, Henry Beauclerk, his brother; and instead of them, a new regiment of southern men, of Essex, Kent, Middlesex, and other parts of the realm, were brought to supply their place, and to inhabit the counties of Northumberland and Westmorland, under the leading of Ranulph de Meschines, sister's son to Hugh Lupus, or Loup, first Earl of Chester."</P>
<P>TANNER.</P></NOTE>
<P><PB N="8" REF="10"/>After Egfrid's having restored the city, and fortified it with a wall, it became an appendage to the see of Lindisfarn, by the royal gift thereof to St. Cuthbert; and so continued till the year 1130, when King Henry I. constituted it a separate bishoprick. By Dugdales Monasticon, it appears, that in 1082, in the acts of William Carilepho, bishop of Durham, it was stiled part of the diocese of the bishop of Durham. It is asserted, that in 1066, William the Conqueror issued his mandate to the inhabitants of Cumberland at large, and of Carlisle in particular, that they should continue subject to the bishop of Durham as their diocesian, from whose predecessors they had received Christianity.</P>
<P>So far we are allowed to speak of this city from the loose records of antiquity; from the time of the Conquest we have more certainty, and evidence of undenia∣ble authenticity to guide us. Camden's description of the site of Carlisle is to this purport, <Q>Between the confluence of these rivers (Peteril and Cauda) the ancient city of Carlisle has a delightful, pleasant situation; bounded on the north with Eden, on the east with Peteril, and on the west with Caude; and, besides these natural fences, it is fortified with a strong stone wall, a castle, and citadel. It is of an oblong form from west to east: to the west is a pretty large castle, which was built by William the second, and repaired by King Richard III. as should seem by the arms.</Q> The period of time between the reign of Egfrid, and the coming of the Danes, affords a sufficient number of years to support a presumption, that this place would greatly improve in importance and power, before the pro∣gress of those ravagers; but the advance only served to aggrandize its woe; for when those invaders had possessed themselves of these northern parts, we find Carlisle again smoking in her ashes:
<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><Q>When they had laid waste Northumberland, their violence was suffered to proceed as far as this city, and lay it in utter ruin; burning the town, throwing down the walls, and killing man, woman, and child, the inhabitants being then very numerous. In that state it was left for near 200 years, without an inhabitant, but some few Irish, who lodged themselves among the ruins. The very foun∣dations of the city were so buried in the earth, that it is said, large oaks grew upon them; and this is not only attested by our historians, but also made out by some discoveries that have been lately made of large unhewn oak trees buried 10 or 12 feet below ground; one of which was found by Mr. Robert Jackson, Alderman, in digging for a well; which round timber, can be no other but some of the old monumental oaks that stood upon the walls, as marks and witnesses of their utter ruin and destruction.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bede.</NOTE> <BIBL>Dr. TODD's MS.</BIBL></Q></NOTE> and so complete was the destruction, that she lay overwhelmed in her desolation, till the time of William the Conqueror, when one of his followers is said to have rebuilt some parts of the city, founded, or restored the ancient religious society there, and dedicated the house to the honour of the Blessed Virgin, of which he became the chief: and, in consequence of these pious works, it was, that the Conqueror issued the foregoing mandate, in which Carlisle was particularly specified; that this body of religious should be
<PB N="9" REF="11"/>subject to the episcopal jurisdiction of Durham, as were the adjacent lands of Northumberland.</P>
<P>King William Rufus
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>But all the ecclesiastical buildings, with the city and adjacent country, being laid waste in the Danish wars, the city was rebuilt and fortified by King William Rufus; and Walter, a Norman priest, being made by that king governor of the city, began a monastery to the honours of the blessed Virgin Mary, which was finished and endowed by King Henry I. who placed therein regular canons of St. Austin.</P>

From the appear∣ance of several parts of the fortifications, one is led to determine, they are the work of that aera; for the Normans brought into this country, some of the best workmen the island ever possessed, as appears by the remains of many of the northern castles, whose dates are well ascertained: and there is so great a simili∣tude of the form and mode of architecture in the great tower of the castle of Car∣lisle, that thence, by a common observer, its date may be ascertained. In the sides of this tower, in several parts, are placed the arms of England, but these seem to denote no more than the reparations made by the several sovereigns.
<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Particularly King Richard III.</NOTE></P>
<P>It is said he first placed here a colony of Flemings, and most probably they were the artificers who raised the fortifications; for soon after, we read of the city being restored and walled, with the defence of a fortress added thereto: we find the Flemings were removed to North Wales, and the isle of Anglesea, and the king replaced them with a colony of South Britains, men used to husbandry, and
<PB N="10" REF="12"/>the culture of lands, who should till this part of the forest of Inglewood, which hitherto had lain in its original state; and teach the natives the mode of reaping from the natural fertility of their country, the many comsorts of life; and the progressive treasures to be won by industry; of which they do not, from any thing mentioned by historians, appear to have conceived a previous idea. To this colony all the records existing attribute the first tillage that was known in the fertile plains of Carlisle. Bishop Gibson, in his edition of Camden, speaking of the evidence touching this matter in the Saxon Chronicle, says, <Q>It has it <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> which at first sight should seem to be an error for; <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>: but in truth, this seems rather to be an error of the librarian, for <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, and on that supposition the words would imply, that a great number of husbandmen were sent thither, and not Englishmen; for, before that time the inhabitants of Carlisle were English: and what follows in the Saxon Chronicle, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, strengthens the conjecture, as expressing the errand upon which they were sent, viz. to cultivate those parts.</Q> This was deep policy in William, as it was in∣troducing a certain employment, which would naturally call together many settlers; and render his kingdom less subject to annoyances from a northern enemy, by the increase of population, and consequent strength of the frontiers. The cultivation introduced by William, had not made so rapid a progress in the course of seventy years, as to have cleared the neighbourhood of Carlisle of wood; for by the char∣ter of King Henry II. the citizens had the privilege of taking fuel, and building timber from the Royal Forest of Carlisle.</P>
<P>Camden says, <Q>Lugubalia now grown populous, had, as they write, its Earl, or rather Lord Ralph Meschines, from whence descended the earls of Chester.</Q></P>
<P><Q>After the death of Richard, Earl of Chester, who was drowned with the king's children, Ranulph Meschines removed to Chester. and was Earl thereof. Pre∣sently after King Henry I. died, and King Stephen usurping the state, gave this county to David, King of Scots, to procure his aid against King Henry II. right heirs to the late king, as son to Maud the Empress, daughter and sole heir to Henry I. But the Scots secretly favoured him for his right's sake; and for that he had made the said Henry Fitz Empress knight at Carlisle. Yet accepting the gift of the county, whereunto he pretended his own right, before granted to his ancestors by the Saxon kings, he made his eldest son, Henry Fitz David, Earl of Huntington and Carlisle; which Henry founded the abbey of Holm Cultram in the time of King Stephen, his father confirming the grant of the revenues wherewith he endowed that house, and so his son Malcom, King of Scots, after David. After Henry Fitz David and King Stephen were dead, King Henry Fitz Empress took Carlisle and the county from the Scots, and granted to the city the first liberties I hear of, that they enjoyed after the Conquest. But his charter was burned by a casual fire that happened in the town, which defaced a great part of the same, and all the records of antiquity of that place.</Q>—DENTON.</P>
<P>The next person we read of in history, who had the title of Earl of Carlisle, was Andrew de Harcla, whom King Edward II. for his good services against Thomas, Earl of Lancaster, and his adherents, and for subduing those who were

<P>A. D. 1322, et reg. Edw. II. ao. 15.—About the feast of the purification of our Lady, Andrew de Herkeley, late made Earl of Carlisle, under colour of peace, found that he would marrie Robert Bruse his sister, whereupon the king reputed him tratour, and caused him to be taken by his trustye frinde, Sir Antonie de Lucy, who sent him in irons strait to London, where he was judged before Sir Antonie de Lucy in this manner: he was ledde to the barre as an Earle worthily appareled, with his sworde girt about him, hosed, booted, and spurred, &amp;c. unto whom Sir Antonie spoke in this manner: "Sir Andrew, "quoth he, the king, for thy valiante service, hath donne thee greate honor, and made thee Earl of Carlisle; since which time, thoue, as a tratour to thy Lord the King, leddest his people, that should have holpe him at the battail of Beighland, away, by the country of Copland, and through the earledome of Lancaster; by which means our Lord the King was discomfited there of the Scots, through thy treason and falsenesse, whereas if thoue haddest come betimes, he had had the victorie: and this treason thou committest for the greate some of gold and silver, that thoue receavest of James Dowglasse, a Scot, the king's enemie. Our Lord the King will, therefore, that the order of knighthoode, by the which thou receavest all thine honor and wooreship upon thy body be brought to nought, and thy state undoone, that other knights of lower degree may after thee beware, and take example hereafter truly to serve." Then commanded he to hew his spurres from his heeles, then to breake his sworde over his headde, which the king had given him to keepe and defende his land therewith, when he made him earle. After this he let uncloath him of his furred tabard, and of his whoode, of his coat of arms, and also of his girdle, and when this was done, Sir Antonie said unto him. "Andrew, quoth he, now art thou no knight, but a knave; and for thy treason, the king will that thou shall be hanged and drawen, and thy headde smit∣ten offe from thy body, thy bowels taken out of thy body and burned before thee, and thy body quar∣tered: and thy headde being smitten offe, afterward to be set upon London bridge, and thy four quarters shall be sent unto four good towns of England, that all other may beware by thee." Which was ac∣cordingly done.</P></NOTE> From the time of his degradation,

<PB N="11" REF="14"/></NOTE> The cita∣del,
<PB N="12" REF="15"/>as it is said, was erected in the reign of King Henry VIII.; and it is surpris∣ing that the whole castle and fortifications should so soon fall into such decay, as to be in the state represented by that report, in the reign of Queen Elizabeth. It appears thereby, that the works consisted of a donjon, whose walls are twelve feet
<PB N="13" REF="16"/>in thickness, an inward and outward ward; the walls of the outward ward, nine feet in thickness, and eighteen feet in height; and the walls of the inner ward, twelve feet, having a half-moon bastion. A tower, called the Captain's Tower. Two gates, one to each ward. In the castle a great chamber and a hall, but no
<PB N="14" REF="17"/>storehouse for amunition. In the walls of the town, three gate-way towers, a se∣micircular bastion, called Springold Tower: and add to these, the citadel. But besides those mentioned in the report, the walls were garnished with several square towers, particularly a tower at the western sally port, and a tower called the Tile Tower, of particular strength.</P>
<P>Before we quit the subject of the castle, we must remark the beautiful and ex∣tensive prospect which you command from the great tower. The foreground is formed of level meads, washed by Eden; in one part, insulated by a separation of the river. This plot is ornamented by two fine stone bridges, one of four, the other of nine arches, the great passage towards Scotland. The hanging banks are crowded with the village and church of Stanwix, and the distant ground filled with the mountains of Bewcastle. To the south, you command the plains to∣wards Penrith, shut in on either hand by a vast chain of mountains; over which Cross-fell and Skiddaw are distinctly seen, greatly eminent. To the east, a varied tract of cultivated country, scattered over with villages and hamlets, mingling beautifully with woodlands on the extensive landscape: the distant horizon form∣ed by the heights of Northumberland.

<P>The parts of the CATHEDRAL now remaining, shew, that the old structure when it was intire, was a noble and solemn edisice. <Q>The body of the cathedral chyrch ys of an older building than the quyer; and yt ys as a filial derived from St. Oswald's fast by Pontfret.</Q> Lel. Itin. vol. VII. page. 48.—but since his days, it has undergone great change, as will be shewn in the sequel. The present edifice consists of the east limb of the cross, being the chancel, and the cross aile or tran∣sept, with the tower: the greatest part of the west limb of the cross, having been pulled down in the civil wars, 1641: with the materials they erected a guard∣house at every gate of the city, and one in the market-place; and two batteries in the castle. The circular arches and massive round columns, <Q>whose shafts are only fourteen feet two inches high, and circumference full seven and a half,</Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pennant.</NOTE> which remain of the west limb and transept, are of the heaviest order of the Saxon architecture; and at the first sight, testify the different ages in which this part and the chancel were erected: indeed the architecture denotes an earlier aera than the time of William Rufus, and probably here is a part of the work of the age of St. Cuthbert: but there is no corroborating evidence to attend the mode of building, which might prove so ancient a date. The west end is said to have been, in length, 135 feet from the cross aile, of which 43 feet remains, it being dismembered of 92 feet. It is not in our power to determine how often this church was restored; it is evident that the Danes laid this city in ashes, and that King William Rufus, under his trusty nominee Walter,
<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">The Magna Bait. has it, that D. King of Scotland, built a great part of this cathedral.</NOTE> restored the city and the public buildings: but so early as the reign of King Henry H. the city was laid waste by the Scots, and the public records were burnt, which most probably, a∣greeable to the custom of those days, were deposited in the archieves of the eccle∣siastics: conceiving this to be the fact, then we must admit of some considerable change in this sacred edifice; for in 1292, we are told, an accidental fire consum∣ed the church, with half of the city, to the number of 1300 houses, as far as the north gate. In the reign of King Edward III. it was rebuilt by contributions. The editor of Camden's words are, <Q>Almost in the middle of the city, stands the cathedral church; <HI>the upper part,</HI> whereof (being newer) is a curious piece of workmanship, <HI>built by King Henry VIII.</HI> but the lower is much more ancient.— The lower west part is the parochial church, and as old as St. Cuthbert; or as Walter, who came in with the Conqueror, was a commander in his army, rebuilt the city, founded a priory, and turning religious, became, himself, the first prior of it.

<PB N="17" REF="21"/>years after the Restoration made in the preceeding reign; but it was ten years be∣fore Bishop Strickland raised the belfrey, which would have been an useless work, when the church was in ruins. These contradictions and ambiguities, we are at present obliged to leave unsolved.</P>
<P>The choir is 137 feet in length, and, with the side ailes, 71 feet broad: the cross aile or transept is 28 feet broad, so that the length of the church, when entire, was exactly 300 feet within. The choir is of fine Gothic architecture, with light columns, remarkably beautiful. The stalls are garnished with taber∣nacle work; (the organ is placed at the cross screen, which contains but a narrow and low entrance, and is a great injury to this fine edifice.) By late repairs it is greatly embellished, being wainscotted with oak, from the stalls round the whole east end of the choir, in a simple stile, after the old order. The open gates leading into the side ailes, are old and much broken, but shew excellent light Tracery work, finely ornamented. The bishop's throne is not magnificent, but yet elegant and stately. The breadth of the choir and ailes being 71 feet, corresponds well with the height, which to the center of the ceiling is 75 feet. The roof was originally lined or vaulted with wood, painted and orna∣mented with arms and devices of the several patrons and contributors to the work; with the arms of France and England, were those of the Piercys, Lucys, Warrens, and Mowbrays. The old wood lining remains in the cross aile, and shews what was the former figure, and the ornaments of the choir: but the outward roof and wood ceiling of the choir having gone greatly to decay, when repairs were made, in 1764 the ceiling was stuccoed, in the form of a groined vault, which is a great advantage to its appearance.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The whole expence amounted to 1300l. towards which, Dean Bolton contributed 50l.; Bishop Lyttleton 100l. and the Countess Dowager Gower, 200l.; the rest was made up by the Dean and Chapter.</NOTE> The east window is large, being 48 feet in height, and 30 in breadth, ornamented with fine pilasters: but it has no cast of solemnity, by means of a border of coloured glass thrown round it, of yellow, red, and green, which looks gaudy.
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>The official duties of marriages, christenings, churchings, and funerals, are performed in the parish church, the ordinary duties of the Sabbath, and prayers twice a-day through the year in the choir. On the burial of any of the members of the choir, the corps is carried into that part of the church. The cathedral and parish church are both under one roof. It has a stately steeple with a ring of eight bells, which are rung on all public occasions. The consistory or spiritual court is kept in part of the church. In the abbey, contiguous to the church, and in which properly the church stands, are several venerable buildings, such as the deanry, sratery, head school, cloisters, porter's lodge, &amp;c.—L.</P></NOTE></P>

<P><PB N="19" REF="24"/>The cross aile from north to south, is 124 feet; in the center is a tower, in height 127 feet, which originally supported a spire of lead, thirteen or fourteen feet high, which being gone greatly to decay, was totally removed soon after the Restoration.</P>
<P>The pillars of the choir are clustered, and in excellent proportion; the arches are pointed; in the inner mouldings of the capitals, are figures and flowers in pierced work, of light carving, and the inside of the arches are prettily ornamented. Two galleries run above the side ailes, but with windows only in the upper: that in the east end has a magnificent simplicity.</P>
<P>When the choir was rebuilt in the reign of King Edward III. indulgences were issued, the common and most effectual claim of assistance; which were of forty days penance to such laity, as should, by money, materials, or labour, contri∣bute to this pious work: and the bishop's register abounds with letters patent, and orders for the purpose.</P>
<P><Q>At the west end of the church, is a large plain altar tomb, called the Blue stone;
<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">This blue stone, at the north end of the transept, is the tomb of Prior Simon Senhouse.</NOTE> on this the tenants of the dean and chapter, by certain tenures, were obliged to pay their rents.</Q>—PENNANT.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="25"/>Several parts of the abbey were enlarged or improved by Prior Gondibour, who occurs in 1484; the initial letters of his name appearing in several parts. In the vestry is preserved an old oak aumery or chest, with an inscription in the old English letter.—<HI>See the Plate, p.</HI> 598.</P>
<P>Prior Senhouse, who occurs in 1507, repaired the square tower within this priory; and on the beams of the middle room are inscribed many sentences, with a moral maxim often used by him, <HI>Loth to offend.</HI>
<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><P>He was an extraordinary character for meekness in disposition.—In old deeds and other writings, he stiled himself "Simon, by the <HI>patience of God,</HI> prior," &amp;c.—He caused to be painted the lives of St. Anthony and others, in the isles of the Cathedral, and likewise the ceiling of the square tower in the priory; from which are copied the following rude verses.</P>

<P>The door with its ornaments, on the south side of the choir, near the bishop's throne; and also the throne was the work of Prior Haythwaite, about the year 1480, his name having been on the backside of it: and the opposite door with its ornaments, is supposed to have been erected by Prior Senhouse, about the year 1500, by the sentence inscribed thereon, <HI>"Vulnera quinque dei sint medicina mei,"</HI> which was that prior's common adage. The tabernacle work in the quire was done at the expence of Bishop Strickland, who came to the see, A. D. 1400.</P>
<P>There were two chapels, and two chantries, founded within this church; the chapel of St. Catharine was founded by John de Capella, a citizen of Carlisle, which he endowed with certain burgage houses, some lands and rents. In 1366, there being an unjust detention of the rights of this chapel, Bishop Appleby gave notice for restitution in ten days, under pain of excommunication by bell, book, and candle. This chapel was on the south side of the church.</P>
<P>The chapel of St. Alban in 1356, was on inquiry, found not to have been con∣secrated, and thenceforth divine offices and sepulture were prohibited to be longer performed therein: this appears by an entry in Bishop Welton's register. On the dissolution, King Edward VI. granted the lands and tenements appertaining to this chantry, unto Thomas Dalston and William Denton.</P>
<P>Bishop Whelpdale founded a chantry, and endowed it with 200l. for holy offices, for the souls of Sir Thomas Skelton, Knt. and Mr. John Glaston.</P>
<P>There was a chantry of the holy cross, but who was the founder, and when it was endowed, is not known; King Edward VI. granted the lands and tenements thereto belonging, in Carlisle and Kirklinton, to Hen. Tanner and Tho. Bucher.

Bishop John Best was also buried here; he departed this life, A. D. 1560. Bishop Henry Robinson was also buried in this church. There is this remarkable entry in the parish register of Dalston, that he died at Rose Castle, on the 19th day of June, 1616, about three o'clock in the afternoon, and was buried in this cathedral, the same evening about eleven o'clock. In taking down the old hangings and orna∣ments of the high altar to make the late repairs, at the north corner was discover∣ed, a brass plate finely engraven, which had been put up to his memory. The bishop is there represented in his pontisicals, kneeling before one church in ruins, and another lately or newly erected: upon the former is inscribed, <Q>Invenit de∣structum, reliquit extructum et instructum:</Q> on the latter, <Q>Intravit per ostium, per mansit fidelis, recessit beatus.</Q> The devices on the plate are whimsical and grotesque.</P>

<P>There is no attempt to explain what person was here interred; it is possible the tomb was made antecedent to the building of the throne.</P>
<P>The whole of this noble edifice is of red freestone, ornamented with pilasters and pointed arches. There have been some statues on the eastern turrets, but they are mutilated, and gone greatly to decay.</P>
<P>No circumstances are come to our knowledge, touching the religious founda∣tions here, before, or in the time of St. Cuthbert, other than the mention made of them by ancient writers; probably they did exist as several persons speaking of St. Cuthbert's life, tell us he founded, A. D. 686, a convent of monks, a school, and an abbey of nuns: but from Bede's Life of that saint, chap. xvii. it appears the nunnery here, to which Queen Emenburga retired, was existing before St. Cuthbert's visiting Carlisle. Mr. Denton's account of these religious foundations is to the following effect:—</P>
<P><Q>When the city was replenished with people, for to maintain better policy in the same; and to inform the people, instead of a nunnery which had been there before, and which William Rufus had translated thence, and established at Ain∣staplighe; or rather in recompence for the lands to that nunnery belonging, had
<Q><L>In the 81st year of his Age, and the 13th of his Consecration.</L>
<L>A Prelate</L>
<L>who by gradual and well merited Advancements</L>
<L>having passed through every Dignity to the Episcopal</L>
<L>supported that</L>
<L>with an amiable Assemblage of Graces and Virtues:</L>
<L>which eminently formed in his Character</L>
<L>The courteous Gentleman and the Pious Christian;</L>
<L>and rendered him a shining Ornament</L>
<L>to his Species, his Nation, his Order.</L>
<L>His Deportment</L>
<L>in all human Relations and Positions</L>
<L>was squared by the Rules of Morality and Religion,</L>
<L>under the constant Direction of a consummate Prudence;</L>
<L>whilst his Equanimity</L>
<L>amidst all Events and Occurrences</L>
<L>in an inviolable Adherence to the golden Medium</L>
<L>made him easy to himself and agreeable to others,</L>
<L>and had its Reward</L>
<L>In a chearful Life, a serene old Age, a composed Death.</L>
<L>His excellent Pattern</L>
<L>Was a continual Lesson of Goodness and Wisdom,</L>
<L>and remains in his ever reverable Memory</L>
<L>an illustrious Object of Praise and Imitation.</L></Q>
<PB N="23" REF="29"/>founded another at Ainstaplighe, endowing the same with other revenues there. King Henry I. founded a college of secular priests in the second year of his reign, and made Athwald his confessor or chaplain, (prior of St. Botophs) first prior of Carlisle, dedicating the church to the honour of the Blessed Virgin Mary, and endowed them with the tithes of the churches then founded in the Forest of Englewood; but being hindred by the tumults and troubles of his time, he could not perfect all things before the 33d year of his reign, and then strucken with grief for the loss of his children, that were drowned coming from Normandy, by the counsel of the Prior Athelwold; and to appease God for his sins, as he thought, he erected a bishop's see at Carlisle, and made the said Athelwald, first bishop thereof, whom the Archbishop of York named Thurstan, did consecrate in the year 1133: and in his stead, another chaplain of the said King Henry, named Walter, was made the second prior of that house, who, a little before his election, had taken upon him, by the king's license, a religious habit, viz. of a regular canon there, which order of canons the king and bishop Athelwold had placed in that house, banishing the secular priests immediately upon his consecration. The said Walter gave to the church of Carlisle for ever in pure alms, his lands in Lynstock, Richardby, Crosby, Little Crosby, Walby, Brunskeugh, Carleton, Little Carleton, and the wood; and the churches or rectories of St. Cuthbert in Carlisle and Staynwings, which the king had given him; and the same gift was confirmed unto them both by the king and bishop Athelwold.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The rectory of St. Cuthbert's in Carlisle, was founded by the former inhabi∣tants of Carlisle before the Danes overthrew the city, and by them dedicated to the honour of St. Cuthbert of Duresm, who of antient times was lord of the same for fifteen miles about Carlisle. At the first foundation of the church every citi∣zen offered a piece of money, which was a coin of brass then current, which they buried under the foundation of the church steeple there as was found to be true at the late re-edifying of St. Cuthbert's steeple, A. D. ****, for when they took up the foundation of the old steeple, they found well near a bushel of that money.</Q></P>
<P><Q>After the said priors, Athelwold and Walter, succeeded John, who gave Water∣croft in Flimby, to the Lord of Workington, son of Gospatrick; and after John, Bartholomew, who, in the time of Bishop Hugh, confirmed Orton in Westmor∣land to the prior of Coneyshead. After him Radulph was prior, who confirmed the impropriation of the rectory of Burgh to the abbey of Holm Cultram, in the time of Walter, bishop of Carlisle.—After Radulph these were priors suc∣cessively: Robert Morvill, Adam Felton, Alanus, Galfridus, John de Horncastle, John de Penrith, William Dalston, Robert Edenhall, Thomas Hoton, Thomas Barnaby, Thomas Hathwaite, Thomas Gudybour, Simon Senhouse, Christopher Slee, Lancelot Salkeld, last prior and first dean.</Q></P>
<P><Q>After King Henry VIII. had changed the priory into a deanry and cathedral church of a new foundation,

<P><Q>The priory wanted not for reliques of saints, for Waldeive the son of Gospa∣trick, Earl of Dunbar, brought from Jerusalem and Constantinople, a bone of St. Paul, and another of St. John Baptist, two stones of Christ's sepulchre, and part of the holy cross, which he gave to the priory, together with a mansion near St. Cuthbert's church, where, at that time, stood an antient building, called Arthur's chamber, taken to be part of the mansion house of King Arthur, the son of Uter Pendragon of memorable note, for his worthiness in the time of antient Kings. Waldeive also gave other antient buildings, called Lyons Yards, often remembered in the history of Arthur, written by a monk; the ruins whereof are still to be seen, as it is thought at Ravenglass, distant from Carlisle, accord∣ing to that author, fifty miles, placed near the sea; and, not without reason, thought therefore to be the same,</Q>—DENTON's MS.</P>
<P>Mr. Denton's account of the money found in rebuilding the sleeple of St. Cuthbert's church, is rendered uncertain by some late discoveries; and it is most
<PB N="25" REF="31"/>probable it was a concealed treasure, intended to be secured against the Danes, or some other ravagers: for when the foundations were making for the present new edifice, and the workmen had gone below the foundations of the old church, they discovered the remains of a still more ancient erection, and took up several pieces of broken sculpture; among the rest the figure of a nun with her veil or hood, well cut and in good preservation, which we saw in the garden of George Mounsey, Esq. of Carlisle; so that it should seem the old nunnery stood there.
<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><P>This sculpture is now lost.—In Mr. Mounsey's, and other gardens adjoining, many foundations of houses, fragments of pottery, quantities of oak-wood, human bones, &amp;c. have been dug up at various times. This ground is upon the east side of English street, and called the Grey-Friars; and up the west side, adjoining the walls, from St. Cuthbert's church to the jail, is called the Black-Friars; and similar things have been dug up here also: a few years ago, in making a drain from a house here towards the walls, the top of an arch was discerned; some of the stones being removed, we discovered a spacious arched room, one side of which rested upon the walls, in height 15 feet, in breadth 12 feet, and in length about 30 feet; the end was narrower and lower, and supposed to have been connected with other similar rooms, but the partitions built up. There were four funnels went upright to the foot-path of the walls, but covered at the top with slags, and iron grates in the funnels. On the opposite side, between two of the arches, a horizontal funnel, about two feet wide and three feet high, went towards the city: this was searched a considerable way, till the person was entangled with rubbish which choaked it up: beneath this passage, the floor was flagged and walled in about 18 inches high on each side, and a conduit went through the city walls on the opposite side of the vault; this was opened by removing the earth on the out side, about four feet deep, and let out a great quantity of water which was lodged in the vault. Proceeding to remove the wet rubbish which was collected, the workmen were interrupted by the gunner of the castle, who assumed a higher power than Mr. Mead, the store keeper, at whose instance the search was making; and the place was immediately shut up and never since opened. We have accurate drawings and measurements, which we have deferred laying before the public till a full investigation of this myste∣rious place be made: we are confident there are many other such kind of vaults in the neighbourhood.</P>
<BIBL>THE EDITORS.</BIBL></NOTE> It seems that Walter's foundation was entirely a new one, and not a revival of St. Cuthbert's institution; for, in Tanner we find <Q>Here was a house of Gray, or Franciscan friars,

<P>Walter, the Norman, laid the foundation of the priory, which he dedicated to the Blessed Virgin: it is said he became the head of the society which he had in∣stituted; but authors of great authenticity, speak of his work as being incomplete at the time of his death; and that King Henry I. in the second year of his reign, took it under his patronage, finished it, and endowed it, A. D. 1101, and therein placed regular canons of the order of St. Augustine, appointing Athelwald his confessor and chaplain the first prior. Notwithstanding Denton's account, we are convinced there was a succession of thirty priors after Athelwald, before the time of the dissolution. Athelwald afterwards being made bishop of this diocese, was succeeded in the priory by Walter, another chaplain of the kings', who had taken upon him the regular habit; and being a rigorous disciplinarian, he banished all
<PB N="26" REF="32"/>the secular priests from that religious house.

The castle of Lin∣stock,
<PB N="28" REF="34"/>in the parish of Stanwix, the capital house of the barony of that name, was for a long series of years, the only palace of the bishops of Carlisle; and in 1293. Johannes Romanus, Archbishop of York, was entertained there, whilst he visited this diocese. The priory was dissolved 9th of Jan. 1540, and the revenues were then valued at 418l. 3s. 4d. ob. 9. according to Dugdale; and 481l. 8s. 1d. Speed. There were cloisters appertaining to this religious house, and also a chapter house, which the dissolute mob, under Cromwell, destroyed: part of the seats, or stalls, of the cloister remain.</P>

<BIBL>ECCLE. SURVEY, 26th K. Henry VIII.</BIBL></P>
<PB N="29" REF="35"/></NOTE></HEAD>
<P>was instituted and founded by King Henry I. in the year 1133, two and thirty years after the foundation of the priory. By the gift of Egfrid, Carlisle became
<PB N="30" REF="36"/>a member of the see of Lindisfarne, and followed the translation of that bishoprick to Chester, and finally to Durham. The cause alledged for dismembering Carlisle, and constituting there a separate see, was on account of the distance from Durham,
<PB N="31" REF="37"/>then the seat of the episcopacy, and the consequential delays of episcopal duties there. According to Camden, the monks of Durham looked upon this act of the
<PB N="32" REF="38"/>sovereign, as a grievous infringement of their ancient rights and privileges; but from the abject disposition of mind, peculiar to that age, they avoided pointing
<PB N="33" REF="39"/>the accusation where it was due, and alledged that <Q>when Ralph, bishop of Dur∣ham was banished, and the church had none to protect it, certain bishops joined
<PB N="34" REF="40"/>Carlisle and Tiviotdale to their diocese.</Q> <Q>It is observable this is the only Episcopal chapter in England, of the order of St. Austin.</Q>—TANNER.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="41"/>King Henry constituted Ethelwald, or as he is some times called, Adeluph, then prior there, the first bishop of this new see: and the church of St. Mary then became a cathedral church.</P>

<HEAD>EPISCOPUS I.</HEAD>
<P>IN the distant age in which the first Bishop of Carlisle arose, little can be gathered of the virtues of memorable actions of men, though even thus eminent: this obscurity is greatest in a country which was almost a constant scene of military exploits, depredations, and bloodshed. Carlisle, though a chief barrier against the Scots, suffered many changes of fortune, and the life of its bishop was frequently disturbed and full of trouble. From such causes, there is but little historic matter handed down to us, personally rela∣tive
<PB N="37" REF="43"/>to this prelate, and several of his immediate successors. We find him indeed busy in one ecclesiasti∣cal matter, in which he was immediately adversary to the will of his sovereign. He was one of the electors of Henry Murdac, abbot of Fountanis to be archbishop of York. The king's displeasure was such at this transaction, that he denounced vengeance against all those who were concerned in it: but such was this prelate's contempt of the sovereign's menaces and self-confidence, that he received Murdac as his metropolitan, when he came to visit David King of Scotland, then resident in this city.
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Pryn. vol. I. p. 521.</NOTE> He departed this life, A. D. 1155,
<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><P>Though some learned persons have affirmed, that before the settlement of Mortmain, 7th King Edward I. impro∣priations were very rare in England; yet this bishop, who died above an hundred years before the enacting that law, confirmed the churches of Wetheral and Warwick, St. Michael, and St. Lawrence, Appleby, Kirby Stephen, Ormes∣head, Morland, Clibburn, Bromfield, Croglin, and the hermitage of St. Andrew, in the parish of Kirkland, to the abbot and convent of St. Mary's, York; with this single proviso, that the said abbot and convent should allow such a portion to the officiating minister, as thereby he may be decently maintained, and be able to pay his synodals.</P></NOTE> and was succeeded by</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="bishop">
<HEAD>EPISCOPUS II.</HEAD>
<P>BERNARD, of whom we know little but his episcopal acts.—In 1169, he dedicated the church of St. Mary Magdalene of Lanercost. He remained bishop of Carlisle to the time of his death, which hap∣pened, A. D. 1186. From the long continued vacancy of the see, it appears evidently, that it was in a sad unsettled state, and full of discord and troubles, as well as meanly revenued; for, by the register of Wetheral, it is shewn that King Henry II. being present at Carlisle, tendered the bishoprick to Paulinus de Leedes, and (as such was even an early influence in the ecclesiastical affairs) offered to augment the income with 300 marks out of the churches of Bambrough and Scarbrough, with the chapel of Tick∣hill, and two manors adjacent to Carlisle: but even with such augmentations Paulinus refused it.
<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot"><P>In 1188, the temporalties continuing in the king's hand, the following particulars, amongst others, were brought into account at the treasury: for oil for the sacrament at Easter two terms, and carrying the same from London to Car∣lisle, 14l. In work of the greater altarand avement in the church of St. Mary, Carlisle, 27s. 9d. In work of dormi∣tory of the canons, 22l. 19s. 2d.</P></NOTE> It continued vacant to the beginning of the 13th century, and King John gave the revenues of the bishop∣rick to support the archbishop of Sclavonia. In 1203, the Pope intermeddled with the income of the see, granting it to the archbishop of Regula, who was obliged to abandon his own, and was destitute of support. This act of the papal authority was confirmed by the king. The continued vacancy let in a flood of enormities among the religious here. The canons publickly announced their contempt of the papal authority, and the censures of his legate: in defiance of all the interdicts and sentences denounced to the contrary, they persisted in celebrating divine services, and all holy offices of the sacraments: but their arrogance and impropieties did not cease there; they swore fealty to the king of Scots, an avowed enemy to the crown of England, and one in open opposition to the authority of the holy see. In conse∣quence of these licentious acts, they set up an interdicted and excommunicated clerk for their bishop, con∣trary to the will of their lawful sovereign, and the pope's legate; and seizing the revenues of the bishoprick, applied them according to their own will. Enormities like these were to be corrected with the severest measures. The council of King Henry III. applied to Pope Honorius III. totally to remove these offensive canons, and place prebends in their room; to augment the revenues of the see, which were so small that no able and loyal person would accept of the bishoprick, and to displace the person who had
<PB N="38" REF="44"/>been thus obtruded, to the episcopacy.

<HEAD>EPISCOPUS III.</HEAD>
<P>HUGH, abbot of Belieu, the elect of Gallo the legate, came to this see when distracted with the offen∣ces of the clergy; yet we do not find that religion was the least abbetted by this prelate: the manners of the religious were not improved, or the errors of those under him reformed; nay, he seemed even doubt∣ful of his own authority, when in the grant made by him to the convent of St. Mary's in York, A. D. 1220, he styles himself, "Hugo dei gratia Karleolensis ecclesiae vocatus sacerdos;" so the register of Wetheral shews. He had the favour of his sovereign, and was one of his sureties, in the treaty entered into with Alexander, King of Scotland.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. I. p. 240.</NOTE> The pope was petitioned to assist in the restoration of the churches of Penrith, Newcastle, Rothbury, Corbridge, and Whittingham, to the see; and in the king's letters on this occasion, he stiles him, "Fidelis noster, cui multo tenemur debito"—"ac sanctae Romanae ecclesiae devotissimus."
<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Pryn. vol. II. p. 375.</NOTE> There cannot be a more certain channel for obtaining the true history of any man's life, than the writings of cotemporaries and neighbours; by such, this prelate so much devoted to the church, as he is stiled by the king, is accused of alienating the possessions of the see; nay, of making fraudulent distributions thereof; and the chronicle of Lanercost passes this dreadful sentence on his un∣timely death. <Q>That <HI>by the just judgment of God he perished miserably,</HI> at the abbey of le Forte, in Bur∣gundy, as he was returning from Rome.</Q> Even if this is the language of truth, it is not that of charity; and shocks the reader, when he perceives it comes from the records of the <HI>scriptores</HI> of a re∣ligious house:—there is a rancour in it that gives a jealousy, some latent cause had dictated the severe asseveration; and we find by the register of Holm Cultram, that about the year 1220, this bishop of Carlisle caused the convent of Lanercost to relinquish a reserved rent, issuing out of the church of Burgh upon Sands, as not having been obtained by canonical rules. If such a cause dictated the rancorous con∣demnation and judgment, what detestation ought we not to hold these impious men in.</P>
<P>We do not find that the episcopacy of this place was to be better filled by the successor of Hugh, whose want of learning gave him even a name of disgraceful distinction, that of <HI>Malclerk.</HI></P>

<PB N="39" REF="45"/>of the manor of Dalston: to this, in 1232, by the king's charter, was added, the office of treasurer of the exchequer of England; with power of executing that duty, by deputy of his own nomination. But Walter held this distinguished office but a very short time, though his charter contained an appointment for life; he was discharged in a disgraceful manner without any cause assigned; his grants, the instru∣ments of his office, were ordered to be cancelled, and he was fined 100l the king appointing Peter de Rival his successor; and commanded S. de Segrave, his justiciar, to put him in possession of the treasury, in case Walter refused to deliver the keys, and all things belonging thereto, by inventory and view, and testimony of true men. The affections and frowns of princes are so fluctuating and uncertain, and their causes so frequently arise from the secret influence of villains, who sport with their sovereign's weaknesses, that we should not from thence deduce the character of any man; this reverse of fortune, some attribute to the intrigues of Peter, Bishop of Winchester, who had great influence with the king. Walter would have repaired to Rome for redress, but having got on board a vessel at Dover, he was arrested by the officers of the crown, and brought on shore. The Bishop of London was a spectator of this outrage, and immediately pronounced a sentence of excommunication against those concerned in this arrest: and so earnestly did he engage in this business, that he hasted to Hereford where the king held his court, and with the assistance of several bishops there present, renewed his sentence.

<P>"The Cornu Eburneum they have yet in the cathedral of Carlisle, a symbol, very probably, of some of King Henry I's grants to the priory; but in none of those grants, of which any copy is now extant, do those tythes appear. The cere∣mony of investiture with a horn, or other like symbol, is very ancient, and was in use before there were any written charters. We read of Ulf a Danish prince, who gave all his lands to the church of York, and the form of the endow∣ment was this; he brought the horn out of which he usually drank, and before the high altar, kneeling devoutly, drank the wine, and by that ceremony enfeossed the church with all his lands and revenues.</P>
<P>King Canute, another Dane, gave lands at Pusey in Berkshire, to the family of that name there, with a horn solemnly delivered as a confirmation of the grant; which horn, it is said, is still there to be seen.</P>
<P>So King Edward the confessor, granted to Nigel the huntsman, an hide of land, called Derehide; and a wood, called Halewood, with the custody of the forest of Bernewood, to hold of the king, to him and his heirs, by one horn, which is the charter of the said forest.</P>
<P>So that, not the Danes only, but the English Saxons also, were acquainted with this ancient custom. Thus Ingulphus, abbot of Crowland, who lived in the time of William the Conqueror, acquaints us that it continued down to his time. He tells us that many estates were granted by word only, without writing, as by delivery of a sword, an helmet, a horn or cup, or such like; but this mode, he says, in after times was changed.</P>
<P>Ulf's horn at York, when the reformation began in King Edward the VI's. time, was swept away amongst other costly ornaments, and sold to a goldsmith, who took away from it the tippings of gold wherewith it was adorned, and the gold chain which was affixed to it. fAfter which time the horn itself, out in ivory, of an Octagon form, came into the hands of General Fairfax; who being a lover of antiquities, preserved it during the confusions of the civil wars; whose memory is deservedly honoured for other generous actions of this nature; such as allowing Mr. Dodsworth, the antiquarian, a yearly salary to preserve the inscriptions in churches, the giving his valuable manuscripts to the university of Oxford, and his preserving the public library there, as he did the cathedral at York from being spoiled and defaced after the surrender of the city. And he dying in 1671, this horn came into the possession of his next kinsman, Lord Fairfax, who ornamented it anew, and restored it to its ancient repository, where it now remains a noble monument of modern as well as ancient piety.—ARCUAEOLOGIA, 168.</P></NOTE> but the grants given in evidence not extending to such tythes, either expressly or by im∣plication, the right was adjudged to the king, and he afterwards granted the same to the prior and convent, as before-mentioned.</P>

He was governor of the castle of Carlisle, A. D. 1302, and had the custody of the Scotch hostages and prisoners. He was joined in commission with the archbishop of York from the holy see, A.

His munificence was singular, though the bishoprick of Carlisle seems to retain the fewest distinguishing marks of it. He bestowed considerable possessions on Pembroke Hall in Cambridge. He was a liberal benefactor to the church of Ely. He founded, at Chichester, a free school, one of his most distinguished acts of charity. He augmented the revenue of the see of Chichester, with valuable gifts in lands; and the dean and chapter there had considerable donations. The most mistaken appropriation his benevolence dictated to him, and which from his opulence took place, was building the new cross in the market-place of Chichester, and giving to the corporation there an estate for its repairs and perpetual maintenance In 1471, we see him named among the prelates who took an oath of fealty to Edward, then Prince of Wales.

<P>JOHN KYTE, who was a man of distinguished parts; though his parentage is not handed down to us, or the nature and place of his education, yet he figured in the offices of the church, in an age when many great characters flourished, without any other advantages than great powers of genius and servility of principles. In the reign of King Henry VII. he was ambassador to Spain: he was also subdean of the royal chapel; and in the year 1513, he was made archbishop of Armagh in Ireland. The influence of Cardinal Wolsey obtained him many dignities; and he was devoted to his service in return; he consulted our bishop on his most momentous concerns, and conversed with him on matters of the highest nature with the greatest familiarity. In the melancholy reverse of his fortune, the friendship was not broken, and the cardinal received his support from the bishop's hands.

Launched so far in the intrigues of a corrupt court, we see his name mixed with those minions, who servilely courted the king's smiles with the forfeiture of virtue. He was one of the four bishops who addressed Pope Clement, the seventh, in the matter of the king's divorce: but in the latter years of his life, after the cardinal was removed, and the political countenance of the court changed, he was wavering in his principles. He was a strong opposer of Cranmer, and the rising spirit of reformation; and in that department, was a public adherent to the archbishoprick of York.—He died in London, 29th of June, 1537, and was buried at Stepney.

<P>ROBERT ALDRIDGE succeeded to the see, A. D. 1537. As he lived in a busy age, and was present to many great changes in church and state, one should expect from a man of so great a character, as to his learning, one whom Erasmus called in his early years, "blanda eloquentiae Juvenis," a poet and ora∣tor of more than ordinary note, that he would have been a shining figure in the multiform business of this part of Henry's reign: but we may judge from his constantly holding the appointments he had, that he temporized with the vereing measures of the prince; and like the notorious, though perhaps, imagi∣nary character of the vicar of Bray, still keeping the saddle, let the object of the pursuit be what it might. The servility that strikes the idea, when one conceives such a character, in the time of this monarch, in∣inspires aversion. It may be a harsh sentence, but it proceeds from a fact, that produces large and na∣tural inferences. Let us attend to his progress in life. Buckinghamshire was the place of his birth, and
<PB N="47" REF="53"/>he received his education at Eaton, till the year 1507, when he was appointed a scholar of King's col∣lege, Cambridge. He was once proctor of that university; and from thence he became master, fellow, and provost of Eaton. About the year 1529, he was made bachelor of divinity at Oxford, and the fol∣lowing year took up his doctor's degree. Soon after, he was appointed archdeacon of Colchester; and in the year 1537, was installed a canon at Windsor, and made register of the order of the garter. He was an opposer of Cranmer, and adhered to the Romish profession of faith; indeed, in the work called the Bishop's Book, containing the godly and pious institution of a christian, it is said he joined with that archbishop; but touching the doctrine of the seven sacraments, his opinion was immediately opposite: and he promoted the act of 31st King Henry VIII. touching the six articles, contrary to every effort of Cranmer.—He departed this life, 1555, and was succeeded by</P>

<HEAD>EPISCOPUS XXXI.</HEAD>
<P>OWEN OGLETHORP; who, by the inconsistencies in his public actions, seems to have been a very weak man. He received the temporalties of this bishoprick in the month of October, in the year 1556; but the pope's confirmatory bull did not arrive till the month of January following. He was born at a small village, near Tadcaster, in the county of York, of inferior parents, and had his education in Magdalene College, Oxford. In the year 1531, he was proctor of the university, and soon after was entered bache∣lor of divinity. In the year 1535, he was chosen president of the college; and in 1551, had the distin∣guished office of vice chancellor. He was made a canon, and soon after dean, of the royal chapel at Windsor; and in the first year of Queen Mary's reign, he was appointed secretary to the order of the garter: this was a year of great honour to him, for in it he held the presidency of Magdalene College, the rectories of Newington and Hassely, in Oxfordshire; together with the deanry of Windsor. In 1554, he was one of the appointed disputants in the controversy with Cranmer, Latimer, and Rydley; and shewed himself a most inveterate adversary to the principles of reformation, and even to that humane rule, toleration. In 1558, we see him acting in the inconsistent character I intimated; for, during the vacancy of the see of Canterbury, when all the bishops had refused to officiate in the coronation of Queen Elizabeth: he only, the lowest of the tribe, the bitterest in the measures against reformists, and the inte∣rests of the protestant church; he only could be found to place the crown on the head of that illustrious princess: the lords of the council, willing that the ceremony should have every outward dignity, sent for all the pontifical robes, and ensigns of high office, used by the archbishop on that solemn occasion, that our prelate might be duely habited for the occasion. It is not to be reconciled, how Oglethorpe could be influenced to this office; the character of the princess, and her sentiments in religious matter, were no secrets; and the bishop's faith and sentiments were publicly avouched: the inconsistency is not to be reconciled, but by the discovery of those influences and private springs of the state, which are long since locked up in the impenetrable regions of oblivion. How must he have been shocked and confounded, whilst the ceremony was performing, by the command of the queen not to elevate the consecrated host, in the celebration of mass, usual in this solemnity, "<HI>because she liked it not.</HI> Wood, with a voice of commiseration, would palliate the error with his pity: <Q>For the fact, when he saw the issue of the mat∣ter, and both himself and the whole tribe of his secret order deprived, the churches holy laws, and faith against the conditions of her consecration, and acception into that royal office violated, he fore repented him all the days of his life, which were, for that special cause, both short and wearisome.</Q></P>
<P>In the first parliament he gave his vote against the bills for restitution of first fruits, for restoring the supremacy, exchange of bishops lands, and uniformity of the common prayer. He would willingly, by his adherence to his old partizans, have recovered a reputation he had lost, by being a tool to the pre∣vailing party; and, by his unsteadiness, he dropt to the ground between the two. The council fined him 250l. for non-attendance at Sewel's challenge in disputation, A. D. 1559, as her majesty had commanded; and shortly after he was deprived of his bishoprick, worth 268l.</P>
<P>His death was sudden, but the cause uncertain; the popular report was, that it happened in an apo∣plexy. He was privately buried at St. Dunstan's in the west. By his will, he ordered the foundation of a school and hospital, at Tadcaster, with an ample endowment.</P>

<P>JOHN BEST who succeeded to the bishoprick, was a man of a different cast, of the true reformists principles; and one who had lived obscurely during the reign of Quen Mary, to conceal himself from
<PB N="48" REF="54"/>the rage and intemperate zeal that distinguished that short, but unhappy period. He was born in the northern parts of Yorkshire, of parents of a low station, and had his education in the university of Oxford. He was consecrated, A. D. 1560, when he was 48 years of age. The unsettled and turbu∣lent estate of the north was such, that he was obliged to have a commission to arm himself and depen∣dants within his bishoprick, against the tumultuous and enraged populace. He was one of those who was created doctor in divinity by Doctor Humphreys, the queen's professor at Oxford, at a private con∣vention in London; and he subscribed the Saxon homilies.

<P>RICHARD BARNES was his successor. From this period of time, the business and importance of bishops in secular affairs declined: in their spiritual powers they were so reduced, that only within their respec∣tive bishopricks, they held the authorities consistent with the ancient rules of the common law, without the superlative aid of the see of Rome; so that, from this aera the history of our prelates becomes little more than personal. Bishop Barnes was born in the county of Lancaster, and educated in Brazen Nose College, Oxford, where he took a degree of master of arts, and was elected a fellow. He had a degree of bachelor of divinity at Cambridge, was chancellor of the cathedral at York, and residentiary canon there for the prebendary of Loughton. In 1567, he was eonsecrated suffragan bishop of Nottingham; and in 1570, was consecrated bishop of Carlisle. By Rymer, it appears, so soon as he was possessed of the church of Rumaldkirk, he should vacate Stokesley, which he held with his bishoprick, together with Stonegrave.

From the ruins of the ancient church, arose innumerable sectaries; the great stock was hewn down, and from the roots issued a multitude of ungrafted shoots, bearing unprofitable fruit; among others, the Arminian principles were introduced: this bishop even taught them on the solemn festival of Christmas, in the chapel-royal, in the hearing of his sovereign, and soon after was translated to the see of Norwich: so formidable was the growth of innovations in religion, and arminianism in particular, that they occasioned a parliamentary inquiry. From his fervour against the papists, he was employed by the king, as a spy upon the conduct of the countess of Denbeigh, who was much inclined to listen to the rules of that faith; to reward him for his assiduity in that duty, he first was made dean of Carlisle, and then appointed to the bishoprick.

<P>JAMES USHER his successor in the bishoprick of Carlisle, was a man of deep erudition, and a zealous protestant, without bigotry and fanaticism, too much the lincture of the age. He held the revenues of this bishoprick, in commendam, by the grant of King Charles I. as a compensation for his great suffer∣ings in his archbishoprick of Armagh in Ireland, by the commotions in that kingdom. He was, by birth, an Irishman, and had his education in the university of Dublin. He was promoted to the bishop∣rick of Meath in 1620, and four years afterwards was advanced to the archbishoprick. With difficulty, and a parsimonious hand, he subsisted on the revenues of our see, diminished and exhausted as they were by the armies of England and Scotland, alternately quartering in this county; at length the seizure which was made by parliament on all the lands of bishops, brought him to great distress. In consideration of his eminent character, his learning and virtuous zeal, he had a pension of 400l. a-year granted to him, by parliamentary order, but it was paid very ill, insomuch that he never received it above once or twice.</P>
<P>He died in March 1655 at the countess of Peterborough's, at Rygate, Surry, in the 76th year of his age: Cromwell, from what principle it cannot be divined, not agreeable to his character, from some sini∣ster view or private influence, ordered him to be buried at the public charge, in Westminster abbey; to defray the expence of which, he gave a draft upon the treasury for 200l. <Q><HI>And this he did out of an

But he was a wretch whose soul could not be touched with such sentiments; hypocrisy, or some low and selfish view intitled him to display this honour and pomp, at the interment of a man, whom he and his creatures had starved to death; inconsistent and abo∣minable are the two contrarieties. Cromwell gave-directions that the bishop's library should not be sold without his consent; but it was plundered of many of the valuable manuscripts; the soldiers took many choice books at a price of their own making, and in the confusion which then distracted the state, the collection was mutilated and greatly prejudiced.

<P>RICHARD STERN was elected, a person of little note by birth. He had his education in Cambridge, was master of Jesus College, and took the degree of doctor in divinity. He was domestic chaplain to archbishop Laud, and attended on the scaffold at his execution. He was a prisoner in the tower with several others, upon a complaint made by Cromwell, who was then one of the burgesses of Cambridge, that they had conveyed the college plate for the king's relief at York: from this cause he was dispossessed of his several appointments, and lived in obscurity till the restoration. In 1664 he was translated to York, and died there in 1683. The character given of him by bishop Burnet, we think ought to receive great credit from the known integrity of the writer; and he intimates that <Q><HI>he was a sour, ill-tempered man, and was chiefly studious of measures to enrich his family: he was particularly attached to the court and servile in adopting the measures then moved in; that he was zealous in the affairs of the duke of York, and was strongly suspected of popery.</HI></Q> Nicholson and Burn have attempted to rescue his character by the publication of a letter which they say was written from York to his successor at Carlisle; but is anonymous, and if it is from the hand of any person of note, it was as easy to subscribe the name, to give it weight and authority, as to publish the sentences to give him a superficial character. <Q>He was greatly respected, and generally lamented. All the clergy commemorate his sweet condescensions, his free communications, faithful counsels, exemplary temperance, chearful hospitality, and bountiful charity</Q>; such is this epistolary panegyric; and which is only equalled by his monumental inscrip∣tion.

<P>EDWARD RAINBOW came to the see in 1664. He was born at Bilton in the county of Lincoln, 1608, being the son of the parish priest there. He was educated at Westminster school, and was a student in Corpus Christi College Oxford. He obtained a fellowship in Magdalen College Cambridge, where he was tutor to several eminent pupils, among whom were the sons of lords, Suffolk and Dain∣court. In the year 1642, he was elected master of Magdalen, and took his degree of doctor of divinity: but he was soon after deprived of his mastership for refusing to sign a protestation against the king. In 1652, he obtained the living of Chesterfield in Essex; and in 1659, the Earl of Warwick presented him to the valuable living of Benefield, in the county of Northampton. He was restored to his master∣ship and made dean of Peterborough soon after K. Charles's restoration, and in the year 1662, he was made vice-chancellor of the university of Cambridge.

<P>THOMAS SMITH born at Whitewall, in Westmorland. He had his education at Appleby free school, and was a student in Queen's College Oxford. He was a man, though deeply read in the learning of his age, of consummate modesty, and humble expectations. In the early part of life, in the university he had the degree of master of arts and held a fellowship. He was a well reputed tutor, and had many eminent pupils. Whilst the king was resident at Oxford, he was appointed preacher at Christ-church; and at St. Mary's, he preached before the Parliament. In the succeeding confusions in church and state, he retired to the north and lived in great privacy. On the restoration he was created bachelor of divinity, and soon after, by diploma, had a doctor's degree given him by the university of Oxford.</P>
<P>He was one of those who were fortunate enough to be in the sovereign's remembrance, for (multitudes were neglected) and was made one of his chaplains in ordinary: in November, 1660, he was nominated to a prebend in this church. A prebend in the cathedral of Durham, in a few months, was offered to him by bishop Cosins, and there he had conceived his preferments in the church were to rest; for at a considerable expence he repaired the house in the college at Durham, in a manner consistent with an idea that it would be the place of his residence for life.</P>
<P>In 1671, he was appointed dean of Carlisle, and in 1684, on the recommendation of K. Charles, he was elected to this see. He died at Rose-Castle, on the 12th of April, 1702, and was buried in this cathedral.
<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot"><P>The dean's house was left by his predecessor in the same ruinous condition the rebellious times had brought it into; but was now mostly, from the ground, built at his own expence.</P>

<HEAD>EPISCOPUS XLV.</HEAD>
<P>WILLIAM NICHOLSON, his successor, was born at Orton near Carlisle, being the son of the rector of that parish. He was a student in Queen's college Oxford, where in 1678, having taken the degree of master of arts, he was elected to a fellowship. In 1681, he was made a prebendary of this church by bishop Rainbow, and had the vicarage of Torpenhow: and in the year following he was made arch∣deacon of Carlisle. In the year 1702, he was consecrated, at Lambeth, bishop of this see; a promotion said to be obtained by the interest of the Musgraves of Edenhall: an assertion injurious to his great learning, his high merit, and connections in life, from whence his promotion was derived.</P>
<P>He found some difficulties from the imperfection of the instruments, in granting institution to doctor Francis Atterbury, to the deanry of Carlisle; which by the queen's special command were obviated: but it is probable this imbittered their minds against each other, for on the bishop's interposition as visitor under the statute of K. Henry VIII, for appeasing certain contests which had arisen between the dean and the chapter; at the dean's instigation, doctor Todd protested against his right of visitation, insisting on the invalidity of that statute, and that in the crown only was vested that privilege:
<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">There was an early grudge between them; for Dr. Attorbury had written against our bishop's English Historical Library, touching convocations.</NOTE> things run so high that Todd was suspended and excommunicated, and the dispute produced such serious consequences, as to promote a law for confirming the statute of K. Henry VIII. In the year 1715, he was made Lord Almoner; in 1718, was translated to Londonderry, in Ireland, and died suddenly, 1726, before his removal to the archbishoprick of Cashell, for which translation the instruments were made out.</P>
<P>He was a celebrated writer, in his works discovering an excellent and almost universal genius. In the year 1678, the secretary of state, Sir Joseph Williamson, sent him to Leipsic to acquire a know∣ledge of the Dutch and other continental languages. At the instance of the professor there, he translated out of the English into Latin, Hook's Essay on the Motion of the Earth from the Sun's Parallax. In the year 1680, he published the three first volumes of the English Atlas, comprehending an account of Poland, Denmark, Norway, Iceland, and Germany. In the year 1685, he wrote two short accounts of the inscriptions on the Bewcastle monument, and font at Bridekirk in this county; published in the philosophical transactions. In 1696 he published the first part of his English historical library, the second part appearing the next year; and in 1699 it was completed in the third part. In 1702 he
<PB N="53" REF="59"/>published one for Scotland, and in 1724 one also for Ireland. In 1705 he published the Border Laws. In 1713 he wrote a preface to doctor Chamberlain's book on the Lord's prayer. In 1717 were pub∣lished in octavo, a collection of papers which had appeared in the Daily Courant, and other periodical prints. In 1719 he wrote a preface to the third edition of doctor Wilkin's Leges Anglo-Saxonicae. He was the author of many sermons which appeared from the press, and left several manuscripts to the dean and chapter of Carlisle, touching this diocese. On his translation he was succeeded in this bishoprick by</P>

<P>CHARLES LYTTLETON, of Hagley in Worcestershire, third son of Sir Thomas Lyttleton. He had his first rudiments at Eton, and completed his studies at University College, Oxford. He was intended for the bar, and accordingly was entered in the temple, and took the gown; but either the excellent vir∣tues mentioned by his panegyrists, proved so incompatible with that profession; or on account of a real tenderness of constitution, which could not endure the heavy and laborious applications of mind which it required, he was obliged to quit the law: he returned to Oxford and entered into holy orders. He had the rectory of Alve church, Worcestershire, in 1742. He was one of the chaplains in ordinary to King George II. and in the year 1748, he was made dean of Exeter. He enioyed this bishoprick but six years, dying A. D. 1768, at his house in London.—He was interred at Hagley.

<HEAD>EPISCOPUS LI.</HEAD>
<P>EDMUND LAW, D. D. succeeded to the see in 1768.—He was born in the parish of Cartmel in Lanca∣shire, in the year 1703. His father, who was a clergyman, held a small chapel in that neighbourhood; but the family had been situated at Askham, in the county of Westmorland. He was educated for some time at Cartmel school, afterwards at the free grammar-school at Kendal; from which he went, very well in∣structed in the learning of grammar schools, to St. John's College in Cambridge.</P>
<P>Soon after taking his first degree, he was elected fellow of Christ's College in that university. During his residence in which college, he became known to the public by a translation of Archbishop King's Essay upon the Origin of Evil, with copious notes; in which many metaphysical subjects, curious and interesting in their own nature, are treated of with great ingenuity, learning, and novelty. To this work was prefixed, under the name of a Preliminary Dissertation, a very valuable piece, written by the Rev. Mr. Gay of Sidney College. Our bishop always spoke of this gentleman in terms of the greatest respect. In the Bible, and in the writings of Mr. Locke, no man, he used to say, was so well versed.</P>
<P>He also, whilst at Christ-College, undertook and went through a very laborious part, in preparing for the press, an edition of Stephen's Thesaurus. His acquaintance, during his first residence in the univer∣sity, was principally with Dr. Waterland, the learned master of Magdalen College; Dr. Jortin, a name known to every scholar; and Dr. Taylor, the editor of Demosthenes.</P>
<P>In the year 1737, he was presented by the university to the living of Graystock, in the county of Cumberland, a rectory of about 300l. a year. The advowson of this benefice belonged to the family of Howards of Graystock, but devolved to the university for this turn, by virtue of an act of parliament, which transfers to these two bodies the nomination to such benefices as appertain, at the time of the vacancy, to the patronage of a Roman Catholic. The right, however, of the university was contested; and it was not till after a law-suit of two years continuance, that Mr. Law was settled in his living. Soon after this, he married Mary, the daughter of John Christian, Esq. of Unerigg, in the county of Cumberland; a lady, whose character is remembered with tenderness and esteem by all who knew her.</P>
<P>In 1743, he was promoted by Sir George Fleming, bishop of Carlisle, to the archdeaconry of that diocese; and in 1746, went from Graystock to reside at Salkeld, a pleasant village upon the banks of the river Eden, the rectory of which is annexed to the archdeaconry. Mr. Law was not one of those who lose and forget themselves in the country. During his residence at Salkeld, he published Considerations on the Theory of Religion: to which were subjoined, Reflections on the Life and Character of Christ; and an appendix concerning the use of the words Soul and Spirit in holy Scripture, and the state of the dead there described.</P>
<P>Dr. Keene held at this time, with the bishoprick of Chester, the mastership of Peterhouse in Cambridge. Desiring to leave the university, he procured Dr. Law to be elected to succeed him in that station. This took place in the year 1756; in which year Dr. Law resigned his archdeaconry in favour of Mr. Eyre, a brother-in-law of Dr. Keene. Two years before this, he had proceeded to his degree of doctor in divinity; in his public exercise for which, he defended the doctrine of what is usually called the "sleep of the soul."</P>
<P>About the year 1760, he was appointed head librarian of the university; a situation which, as it pro∣cured an easy and quick access to books, was peculiarly agreeable to his taste and habits. Some time
<PB N="55" REF="61"/>after this, he was also appointed casuistical professor. In the year 1762, he suffered an irreparable loss by the death of his wife; a loss in itself every way afflicting, and rendered more so by the situation of his family, which then consisted of eleven children, many of them very young. Some years afterwards, he received several preferments, which were rather honourable expressions of regard from his friends, than of much advantage to his fortune.</P>
<P>By Dr. Cornwallis, then bishop of Litchfield, afterwards archbishop of Canterbury, who had been his pupil at Christ College, he was appointed to the archdeaconry of Staffordshire, and to a prebend in the church of Litchfield. By his old acquaintance, Dr. Green, bishop of Lincoln, he was made a prebendary of that church. But in the year 1767, by the intervention of the duke of Newcastle, to whose interest, in the memorable contest for the high stewardship of the university, he had adhered in opposition to some temptations, he obtained a stall in the church of Durham. The year after this, the duke of Grafton, who had a short time before been elected chancellor of the university, recommended the master of Peter∣house to his majesty for the bishoprick of Carlisle. This recommendation was made, not only without solicitation on his part or that of his friends, but without his knowledge, until the duke's intention in his favour was signified to him by the archbishop.</P>
<P>In or about the year 1777, our bishop gave to the public a handsome edition, in three volumes quarto, of the Works of Mr. Locke, with a Life of the Author, and a preface. Mr. Locke's writings and cha∣racter he held in the highest esteem, and seems to have drawn from them many of his own principles: he was a disciple of that school. About the same time he published a tract, which engaged some atten∣tion in the controversy concerning subscription; and he published new editions of his two principal works, with considerable additions, and some alterations. Besides the works already mentioned, he published, in 1734, or 1735, a very ingenious <HI>Inquiry into the Ideas of Space, Time,</HI> &amp;c. in which he combats the opinions of Dr. Clarke and his adherents on these subjects.</P>
<P>Dr. Law held the see of Carlisle almost nineteen years; during which time he twice, only, omitted spending the summer months in his diocese at the bishop's residence at Rose Castle; a situation with which he was much pleased, not only on account of the natural beauty of the place, but because it restored him to the country, in which he had spent the best part of his life. In the year 1787, he paid this visit in a state of great weakness and exhaustion; and died at Rose about a month after his arrival there, on the 14th day of August, and in the 84th year of his age.</P>
<P>The life of Dr. Law was a life of incessant reading, and thought, almost entirely directed to meta∣physical and religious inquires; but the tenet by which his name and writings are principally distin∣guished, is "that Jesus Christ, at his second coming, will, by an act of his power, restore to life and consciousness the dead of the human species, who, by their own nature, and without this interposition, would remain in the state of insensibility, to which the death brought upon mankind by the sin of Adam had reduced them." He interpreted literally that saying of St. Paul, 1 Cor. XV. 21. <Q>As by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead.</Q> This opinion had no other effect upon his own mind than to increase his reverence for Christianity, and for its divine Founder. He retained it, as he did his other speculative opinions, without laying, as many are wont to do, an extravagant stress upon their importance, and without pretending to more certainty than the subject allowed of. No man formed his own conclusions with more freedom, or treated those of others with greater candour and equity. He never quarrelled with any person for differing from him, or considered that difference as a sufficient reason for questioning any man's sincerity, or judging meanly of his understanding. He was zealously attached to religious liberty, because he thought that it leads to truth; yet from his heart he loved peace. But he did not perceive any repugnancy in these two things. There was nothing in his elevation to his bishoprick which he spoke of with more pleasure, than its being a proof that decent freedom of inquiry was not discouraged.</P>
<P>He was a man of great softness of manners, and of the mildest and most tranquil disposition. His voice was never raised above its ordinary pitch. His countenance seemed never to have been ruffled; it preserved the same kind and composed aspect, truly indicating the calmness and benignity of his temper. He had an utter dislike of large and mixed companies. Next to his books his chief satisfaction was in the serious conversation of a literary companion, or in the company of a few friends. In this sort of society he would open his mind with great unreservedness, and with a peculiar turn and sprightliness of expression. His person was low, but well formed; his complexion fair and delicate. Except occasional interruptions by the gout, he had for the greatest part of his life enjoyed good health; and when not confined by that distemper, was full of motion and activity. About nine years before his death, he was
<PB N="56" REF="62"/>greatly enfeebled by a severe attack of the gout in his stomach; and a short time after that, lost the use of one of his legs. Notwithstanding his fondness for exercise, he resigned himself to this change, not only without complaint, but without any sensible diminution of his chearfulness and good humour. His fault (for we are not writing a panegyric) was the general fault of retired and studious characters, too great a degree of inaction and facility in his public station. The modesty, or rather bashfulness of his nature, together with an extreme unwillingness to give pain, rendered him sometimes less firm and efficient in the administration of authority than was requisite. But it is the condition of human mortality. There is an opposition between some virtues which seldom permits them to subsist together in perfection

<P>The city of Carlisle is divided into two parishes. The parish of St. Mary's, or which the cathedral is the parochial church;
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It comprehends Scotch-street, Fisher-street, Castle-street, and Abbey-street, within the city; Cal∣dewgate, Cumbersdale, Richardgate, Newtown, and Newby without.</NOTE> the city and principal parts of both parishes are within that liberty, which is known by the name of the manor of the soccage of Carlisle. In the notes is the boundaries.
<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><P>By virtue of a commission issued from the court of exchequer, 1610; the boundaries were thus certified by the commissioners. Beginning at the south side of the river Eden over against Etterby, and there leaving the same river, it extendeth southwards by Wearihome unto Dowbeck-sike the lands on the right hand being the inheritance of Mr. Briscoe; from thence it extendeth eastwards against bishops lands to the river of Caldew or Caldew-bridge; where crossing over the same bridge against Caldew∣gate, it extendeth up the river against the abbey lands and Denton-holme, until it cometh to a parcel of Denton-Holme, lying on the west side of Caldew, containing about nine acres of land, where it leaveth the river and incloseth the same parcel of land, on the west side thereof, on the river side against the south west corner of the Walk-miln closes; and so crossing over the river and leaving the same, it ex∣tendeth southwards towards Curreck, by the west side of the fields of Blackall, Curreck and Uprightby; and so about the same fields to a cross way of the west end of Uprightby town; and so southwards by the high way to Crunybeck, which falleth into the river of Petrell, and there leaving the same way, it extendeth down the same beck to Petrell; and from it turneth northwards down the same river to the south east corner of Paradise, where, crossing the river and leaving it, it goeth down a small miln water on the south side of Paradise, and incloseth the same at Gallows bridge; from whence, crossing over the high way it incloseth part of the Spittle Crook lying on the south side of Petrell; and so extendeth still down Petrell to the foot thereof, where the same falleth into Eden; from thence up over the said river of Eden to the foot of a beck falling thereunto against Kynnyholme, and so up the same beck on the west side of Richardby to the north-west corner of Stanwix grounds; then leaving the same beck it extendeth northwards to the highway leading from Carlisle to Tirraby; and so crossing over the same way, it passeth on the north side of Horsemanfield to the north west corner thereof, and from thence extendeth southwards to a highway dividing Horsemanfield and the west part of Stanwix; and so crossing the same way, it extendeth on the west side of Stanwix to the river of Eden, and from thence down the same river to Etterby, where it first began.</P></NOTE></P>
<P>The parish of St. Cuthbert's is the other division of this city. The church
<PB N="59" REF="65"/>becoming ruinous, was rebuilt in 1778, on a new and handsome plan, neatly vault∣ed, pewed, galleried, and well lighted: it has a square steeple or tower, with a dome, and covered with lead, but no ring of bells. The income is but small, yet having had several augmentations, lands have been lately purchased and added thereto, of the yearly value of forty pounds.
<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">It comprehends English street within the city, and Botchardgate, Carleton, Brisco, Uprightby, Harraby, and Blackhill without.</NOTE></P>
<P>In this parish is the chapelry of Wrea; its antiquity cannot be ascertained further back than the reign of King Edward II, In 1319, Bishop Halton allowed a chaplain there, on condition that he resided within his chapelry. It consists of the village of Wrea, which consist of twenty-one families, containing sixty males and fifty-four females. A. D. 1739, the chapel was consecrated by Bishop Flem∣ing; and by augmentations lands have been purchased, so that the curate's income amounts to about 20l. a-year, with a good house upon the lands. In the act of consecration, the nomination of a curate is reserved to the dean and chapter; but hitherto they have been appointed by the vestry men.

<P>Woodside, the seat of John Losh, Esq.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>"On Thursday last died at Gordon Castle of the small pox, in the 26th year of his age, the Rev. Mr. William Losh, senior, <HI>Taberder</HI> of Queen's College Oxford, and chaplain to her grace the duchess of Gordon. He was a gentleman of the brightest parts, and had made great advances in all the branches of polite and solid learning that could well be expected at his years. He was blest with so sweet and humane a disposition, that the common accidents of life gave him no lasting disquiet, nor interrupted that universal benevolence, which, with him, diffused itself in a proportionable scale of duty from the whole body of mankind to the meanest stranger. This benign disposition made him the constant advocate of the rights and priviledges of the human species, in opposition to tyranny and oppression; these he maintain∣ed, upon all occasions, with a warmth and spirit which well became a British subject. He had many good qualities, but was eminent for piety; and as he drew from religion an unbroken peace of mind, a solid satisfaction, and an unsurmountable courage; in return, he cultivated religion in the province assigned to him with indefatigable industry, and a zeal undaunted, but such as was founded on scripture, and sup∣ported by reason.</P>
<P>"With all these endowments, he lived the agreeable companion of the ingenious, the faithful friend of the virtuous, and the brother of the truly religious, as well as the terror of the hypocrite, the super∣stitious and the prophane. He was bright at all times, but he shone in the pulpit, when he pleaded the cause of truth, with such a strength of reason, and such a flow of eloquence, that his hearers were at once convinced and charmed.</P>
<P>"He died in the very spring of his age, and but in the blossom of his virtues, yet he discovered enough to make it evident, that had he lived to shew himself in the rising stages of life, his great and uncommon endowments would have rendered him dear to the polite, the learned, and the religious; and his death would have been as justly regretted by the public, as it is at present by those who had the happiness of knowing him."</P></NOTE> adjoining this chapelry, the residence of his forefathers for many generations, is a handsome house and elegantly fur∣nished:
<PB N="60" REF="66"/>his extensive estate is in high cultivation. We owe him our grateful acknowledgements for the annexed plate which he has favoured us with.</P>
<P>There are two manors within this parish, viz. the manor of Botchardgate, or prior lordship, belonging to the dean and chapter, and the manor of Blackhall.</P>
<P><Q>Botchardby, villa Bochardi, was the inheritance of one Bocharda Fleming, one of those that first peopled Carlisle; he had a grange there for the provi∣sion of his house at Carlisle; and when the Flemings went to Anglesea in Wales, he left that patrimony to Guy the forester, with his daughter Isold. To this Guy the hunter, King Henry I. confirmed Bochardby, to hold the same by cornage, paying yearly 6s. 2d. cornage silver to the king. It is gildable and vicontiel, and gives aid with Combquinton to the sheriff, yearly 4s. 4d. torn silver. It lineally descended in the issue male unto William, the son of Otho or Odan, son of Ralph, son of Guido the hunter, de Bochardby. This William lived in the time of King John, and held then the manor of him. Then Wil∣liam de Bochardby, and Adam de Bochardby, descended of younger brothers, held parts of the same. In the 12th year of King Henry III. Radulph, the son of William de Bochardby entered to the seigniory; his sisters, Alice, Pavy, and Agnes, were his heirs: Alice and Agnes gave their parts to Jacoline le Blond of Carlisle, and Pavy her part to Adam Leges her son, and to William, son of Irco. The five daughters of Jacoline did inherit, viz. Sunimote, Johan, Matild, Juhan, and Marriotte.—Bochard.—Guido Venator, and I sold his wife.—Ralph, son of Guy.—Odo, son of Ralph.—William, son of Odo.—Ralph, son of William.— Walter.—Adam.—Robert Parving.—Adam Parving, 3d Richard II.—Robert Parving.—William Stapleton.—William Stapleton.—Margaret Stapleton.— Musgrave.—Tho. Birkbeck.</Q>—DENTON's MS.</P>
<P><Q>Blackhall or Blackhill, commonly called Blackhell, is the name of the town and manor, so called of old, before it was inhabited; being a black heathy ground, part of the ancient forest of Englewood, and given by Henry I. to Odard de Logis, baron of Wigton, and citizen of Carlisle, after the Flemings were thence translated: Odard first builded there and planted habitations, holding part in demesne, and the residue in service; some free, which he granted forth to be holden freely; others in bondage and villanage, some both persons and land, some land only let to free men, persons, in that age, called Drenges; and the tenure, in law, is called, "Drengagium notandum est eos omnes eorum antecessores, qui Drengorum classe erant, vel per Drengagium tenure, sua in∣coluisse patrimonia ante adventum Normanorum.</Q>—SPELMAN.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="67"/><Q>Blackhill, thus made a manor by Odardus and his posterity, descended by his issue male, according to the pedigree of Wigton, until the time of Edward III. when Margaret de Wigton, sole daughter and heir of Sir John de Wigton, Knt. (last issue male of the eldest son of that house) to defend her birth-right, was glad to divide away the manors of Blackhill, Melmerby, and Stainton, to Robert Parving, the king's serjeant at law, for her strength at the common law; the rectory of Wigton to the Abbey Holme, for the civil law; and Wigton itself to the Lord Anthony Lucy, for his help in the country, because her mother, Idyo∣nysa Lovelot, was bitterly taxed of incontinency, at the instance of Sir Richard Kirkbride, next heir male apparent to the land. But Margaret de Wigton re∣served an estate, in all things but the rectory, to the heirs of her body, and died without issue. Therefore Blackhill fell to Sir Robert Parving, who married dame Catharine, the sister of the said Kirkbride, to Adam Parving, alias Peacock, the son of John Peacock, who married Johan, one of the daughters and coheirs of the said Sir Robert Parving. After Adam, it descended in the blood of the Parvings some few descents, until Margaret, the wife of Thomas Boyt, and William Boyt his son, descended of the said Johan, and Matild Walker, the daughter of Alice Atwood and Thomas Whitlockman, son and heir of Marga∣ret Pape, daughters and heirs of Eme, wife of John Scaleby, the other daughter and heir of the said Robert Parving, sold the same to William Stapleton, and Marriotte his wife, of whom the Lord Dacre purchased it.</Q>—DENTON's MS.</P>
<P>By the descendants of Lord Dacre, it was sold to Sir Christopher Musgrave, Bart. grandfather of the present owner, Sir John C. Musgrave, Bart.</P>
<P><Q>In the parish of St. Mary is the manor of Caldcoates, alias Harrington House. It was Gilbert Camterelles, A. D. 1371, who left it to Julian his wife: she convey∣ed it to John Semen, and Isabel his wife, whose son, Thomas Semen, 26th Henry VI. sold it to Richard Coldale of Carlisle, merchant, from whom it descended as followeth; and from this Coldale, has got the name of Coldale-Hall:—John Coldale, son of Richard.—Richard, son of John.—John, son of Richard.—John —Richard, son of John.—Elianor, daughter and heir of Richard, carried the in∣heritance, by marriage, to Robert Briscoe, son and heir of Leo.

<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>In the year 1698, Thomas, Earl of Sussex, in consideration of 36 years ancient sinable rent, granted to the tenants, 48 in number, a discharge from fines and dry multure, with the wood upon their tenements; but reserving the ancient rent, suit of court, Moor Farm, and Greenhew; with liberty to alienate their tenements without licence of the lord, giving notice thereof within 40 days; paying only a penny sine on death or alienation, and to the steward for an alienation, fourpence: and for surrender and copy thereof, 6d; and inrolment 4d. and 2d. to the bailiff upon every descent or alienation; and about the same time the common was divided and granted in see to the tenants without any rent reserved, the lord having 150 acres for his share in land, which is now called Blackhill Park, and is the inheritance of Mr. Wardale of Carlisle.</P></NOTE>—<HI>Milbourn's Add. to Denton.</HI></P>
<P>We come in course to speak of the city of Carlisle: It consists of several streets, the chief of which are spacious, noble, and well built.—<HI>For their names, &amp;c. see the plan annexed.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="68"/>This city had many royal grants, and great privileges: the first that is pointed out, is that of King Henry II. which was burnt by the devastations made by the Scots, and is recited and confirmed by the charter of King Henry III. It doth not appear when the first incorporation of the burgesses took place, or what was the original constitution. In the charter of King Henry III. we have these words, <Q>Et quod similiter habent Gildain mercatoriam liberam, ita quod nihil inde re∣spondeant aliquibus; etc. Nos omnes libertates illas et consuetudinos praefatis civibus nostris concedimus et hac carta nostra confirmanus pro nobis et haeredi∣bus nostris; volentes, quod omnibus praedictis libertatibus et consuetudinibus de caetera gaudeant et utantur, libere, quiete, bene et in pace; et integre, in per∣petuum, cum omnibus aliis libertatibus et liberis consuetudinibus ad praedictam villam Carlioli pertinentibus.</Q></P>
<P>By this charter the citizens were exempted from the payment of toll, passage, pontage, and all customs belonging to the king; with the privilege of having wood for fuel, and for their erections within the forest of Carlisle.</P>
<P>Great part of the city having again suffered by accidental fire, the records were a second time destroyed. King Edward I. in the 21st year of his reign, by charter, dated the 23d day of June, recites the grant of King Henry III. from the inroll∣ment of it in his chancery, and stating that it had been lost by fire, confirmed it verbatim. In consequence of his Scotch expeditions, he resided frequently at Carlisle, and seems to have entertained a particular regard for the place, by his honouring the city with the assembly of his parliament in the 35th year of his reign; who made their residence there, from the 20th day of January to Palm Sunday following. The memorable acts of this parliament give no small lustre to our annals.</P>
<P>King Edward III. also seems to have entertained a special affection and favour towards the citizens; and in order to secure to the burgesses their privileges, he caused an inquisition to be taken, whereon he should found his charter of confir∣mation, which bears date the 7th of February, in the 22d year of his reign of England, and 13th of France. Therein it is recited, that it having been found by inquisition taken by his commissioners, Richard de Denton and John de Harring∣ton, and returned into his chancery, that the citizens, <Q>habuerunt et habere con∣sueverunt a tempore quo non existit memoria,</Q> had, and were used to have, the privileges therein set forth, for time immemorial, on the petition of the citizens; <Q>ac etiam cives civitatis praedicta nobis supplicaverunt, ut sibi dictas libertates, quietantias, consuetudines et proficua per chartam nostram confirmare velimus.</Q> And in consideration of its being in the frontier of Scotland, and well situated for the refuge and desence of the inhabitants of the adjacent territories, against the frequent incursions of the Scots: and also, in commiseration of the late dreadful mortality of the plague, and the frequent devastations made by the northern ene∣my,
<PB N="63" REF="69"/>he granted to them the following privileges, <Q>Quod ipsi et eorum haeredes et successores, cives civitatis praedide, in perpetuum habeant returnam brevium omnium nostrorum et summonitionum de scaccario et aliorum brevium quo∣rumcunque; ac etiam duos mercatus singulis septimanis, videlicet diebus Mer∣curii et Sabbati; et unam feriam quolibet anno per sex decim dies duraturam, viz. in die assumptionis Bea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ae Mariae et per 15 dies proxime sequentes: nec non unam gildam et liberam electionem majoris et ballivorum civitatis praedictae infra eandem civitatem; et duos coronatores ibidem; ac emendas assisae panis, vini, et cervisiae fractae; fureas, infangtheos ac etiam placita coronae teneant, et omnia quae ad officium vicecomitis et coronatoris pertinent, in eadem civitate facient et exercient; ac catalla felonium et fugitivorum dampnatorum, in eadem civitate habeant; et de omnibus finibus et amerciamentis, comitatibus et sectis comitatuum, et Wapentak, sint quieti; placitaque frisciae forciae de libero tene∣mento infra civitatem illam, si querela illa infra quadraginto dies post disseisinam factam fuerit attachiata, teneant. etiamque quod ballivi civitatis ejusdem im∣placitare possint coram ipsis breve nostrum de recto patens, ac breve de recto clausum, secundum consuetudinem civitatis praedictae; et habeant cognitiones omnium placitorum praedictorum: nec non quod dicti cives et haeredis et suc∣cessores sui habeant communam pasturae, ad omnimoda averia, omni tempore anni, super moram nostram, et ibidem turbas fodere et abducere licite: etiam quod quilibet liber homo pleguis alterius esse potest ad primam curiam in pla∣citis transgressionum, conventionum, et debitorum: quod civis praedicti quieti sint perpetutum regnum nostrum Angliae de thelonio, pontagio, passagio, lastagio, kaiagio, cariagio, muragio, et stallagio, de quibus cunque rebus et mercionibus suis: et etiam quod idem cives habeant locum vocatum le Battail holme, pro mercato et seriis suis; ac tenementa sua in eadem civitate legare possint: et quod habeant molendinum dictae civitatis, &amp;c. piscariam, nostram in aqua de Eden, ac thelonium intrisicum et forinsicum vocatum.

<P>By the recitals of this grant it seems, that preceding it, and even for time im∣memorial, the city had been governed by a mayor, bailiffs, and coroners; but when this body politic had its commencement, there is no evidence that we have yet met with.</P>
<P>King Richard II. in the 5th year of his reign, granted them a confirmatory charter.</P>
<P>In consequence of the spoil and devastation, made by the armies of Margaret, Queen of England, and Henry Duke of Exeter her adherent, the city obtained from King Edward IV. a relaxation of one half of the fee-farm rent of eighty pounds yearly, paid to the crown; and also gained a grant of the king's fisheries of Car∣lisle, in some records called the Sheriff's Net; in others, under the denomination of the fishery of Frith Net, in the water of Eden.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="70"/>The rights and privileges of the city were confirmed by several charters of King Henry VII. 3d year of his reign; King Henry VIII. 1st, King Edward VI. 5th, Queen Elizabeth, and King James I. 2d.</P>
<P>King Charles I. in the 13th year of his reign, confirmed the preceding grants of privileges, reforming only the election of mayors, bailiffs, and coroners: this body corporate then, consisting of a mayor, eleven aldermen, two bailiffs, two coroners, and twenty-four capital citizens or common council, were ordered to proceed to election in the following manner: <Q>The mayor, aldermen, bailiffs, and twenty-four capiral citizens, or the major part of them, in Guild-Hall assembled, on the Monday next after Michaelmas-day, shall have power to chuse annually one of the aldermen to be mayor; and in case of an equality, the mayor to have a casting vote; and the mayor so chosen shall be sworn into his office by the last mayor, if he be living; otherwise by the aldermen or major part of them; and shall continue therein 'till another shall be chosen and sworn. In like manner, the two bailiffs and two coroners, annually shall be chosen and sworn.</Q>

<P><PB N="66" REF="72"/>There was an ancient hospital without the gates of the city, dedicated to St. Nicholas, and said to be of royal foundation, though by what sovereign is not known; it was instituted for the reception of thirteen lepers, of both sexes. In the year 1180, it was endowed with a moiety of the tithes of Little Bampton, by Adam, son of Robert, on condition that it should constantly receive two almsmen from thence. In the year 1336, the master brought a prohibition against the
<PB N="67" REF="73"/>bishop to prevent his visitation, on an allegation of the hospital being a royal foundation. In 1371, the master, brethren, and sisters, lodged a complaint, that the house was defrauded of a great part of its revenues, on which the bishop issued a monition, with the terrors of the greater excommunication, against all persons who detained the corn, or other dues appertaining to this hospital. <Q>It was granted to the prior and convent of the cathedral church here, 17th K. Edward IV. and afterwards 33d Henry VIII. made part of the endowment of the dean and chapter,</Q> under whom the site of the hospital is now held by lease.

On the reverse, is the emperor seated on a pile of arms, with a trophy erected before him, the legible letters being S.P.Q.R. OPTI... .. in the exergue S.C.

<P>CARLISLE, <HI>April</HI> 13th, 1743.</P>
<P><HI>Extract of a Letter from Mr.</HI> RICHARD GOODMAN, <HI>Keeper of Carlisle Goal, dated</HI> 22d <HI>of July,</HI> 1728.</P>
<P><Q>The figure of a crescent I here send you, is sufficient to let you see what it is. It is of copper, found in digging a cellar opposite to the Bush-Inn here. It lay about nine feet deep: as I looked upon it to be a choice piece of antiquity, I have procured the original for you: I take it to be a symbol of Isis, and also wore by other gods. The shank or stem, by which it was stuck into the figure or standard is very strong, and has a hole for a pin to fasten it; from which shank, arises a ring on the backside, which is also very strong, and will take in a man's finger. I presume it might be to fasten some parts of the garb or for what other use, I beg your thoughts.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Extract from Mr.</HI> GALE's <HI>Answer.</HI></P>
<P><Q>As for the brass plate you sent me, it seems to be nothing but an ornament belonging to the trappings of a horse, and might have hung before his breast, by the ring on the backside of it. The hole through the shank has been for fastening a drop or pendant to it, as a further ornament.</Q></P>
<P><Q>In opening a gravel pitt lately, on the side of a hill, in the parish of Stanwix, just without the suburbs of Carlisle, a stratum of bones were discovered, at about a yard below the surface, lying about a foot thick in most parts, and stretching the whole length of the pit, which I apprehend to be near twenty feet. I exa∣mined the spot, and found divers fragments of Roman pottery ware,
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Elegant specimens, and some of the bones were exhibited.</NOTE> intermixed with the bones. They are, I think, the bones of horses, and might, perhaps,
<PB N="70" REF="76"/>have been buried after an engagement between the Romans and Picts; but it is not so easy to account for the fragments of pottery, &amp;c. which were found in great numbers intermixed with them.</Q></P>
<P><Q>N. B. The Picts Wall ran within less than half a mile of the spot where these bones were found.</Q>—Dated Dec. 18th, 1765, (signed) C. LYTTLETON.</P>
<P>In the Archaeologia, is published accounts of stone hatchets found at Carlisle, with a learned treatise thereon; and to which we refer the curious reader.</P>
<P>If we may presume to offer our sentiments on these subjects, after the learned antiquaries have so elaborately expatiated thereon, without the appearance of arrogance and presumption, we would suggest, that the bones mentioned by the bishop, mixed with the fragments of the patarae, were the remains of sacrifice: when the ordinary receptacle was cleaned out, this has been the general repository. If these were the remains of animals slain in battle, the mixture is not to be reconciled; and it was more than such occasion would have required to clear them from the bones of men slain at the same time. The learned inquirer did not dis∣cover any remains of broken trapping, studings, or ornaments of horses, or men accoutrements. The hammers, or stone hatchets, seem very unfit for weapons of warfare, unweildy, and uncouth: if they had been in use in battle, some testimony would have been given of them; and they would not have been totally disused, one might presume, at the coming of the Romans, but would have been exhibited as trophies, or otherwise as testimonies of the valour of British heroes, the ancstors of those who appeared armed against the invaders, in the most sacred cause of war, the defence of liberty, and their country; and the maintenance of the established religion. We have received no account of such weapons then in use. As domestic utensils, it is not probable they would have been secreted with such care, or de∣posited with such solemnity, as even to support the head of the deceased owner in the sepulchre. Could we imagine the friends of any personage, who was to be interred with the funeral pomp of a tumulus, would busy themselves with giving the deceased labourer his beetle with him, for the regions of death We humbly conceive this was a sacred implement in the possession of the heathen priest, with which he prepared the sacrifice: we have innumerable relations, of the abhorrence the ancients had, of their sacred things and places being polluted by strangers; and thence we trace the cause of these flints being concealed. All degrees of reli∣gious, in remote ages, took great precaution to bury, with the consecrated minister, the instruments of his office, and that was followed in the practice of the ancient Romish church. The sacred <HI>securis</HI> of the British priest, was the first emblem of his function, and the properest ornament to be placed with his remains in the tomb. The remnants of British priests were driven into Scotland by the arms of Rome; there they longest retained their ancient rites and religion, and there those instruments of the ancient priesthood have been most frequently found.

<P><PB N="71" REF="77"/>Carlisle, from its situation, was continually subject to the distress of warsare, in the several irruptions of the Scots; and frequently was taken from the English. The border wars were prosecuted with a degree of ferocity and savage barbarity, disgraceful to humanity, and horrid in history.</P>
<P>Among the various incidents in the history of Carlisle, the following are the most material.</P>
<P>So soon, after the fortifications were constructed, as the beginning of the reign of King Stephen, David King of Scotland, in the first year of his reign, entered into England, and took possession of this city. Stephen, on receiving the news, is said to have exclaimed, "Quae dolose cepit victoriose recipiam;" but this weak prince, so far from performing what he boasted, made a cession of the whole county to the Scots.

<P>In the year 1138, King David of Scotland, made this city the place of his re∣treat, after his dreadful overthrow at the battle of the Standard. And here he re∣ceived Alberic the pope's legate, by whose influence, all the women captives were brought to Carlisle and set at liberty. He obtained from the Scotch leaders, a solemn promise, that in future incursions, they would spare the churches, and with hold their swords from the aged, from women and infants: an injunction which humanity dictated, but which the savage customs of the contending nati∣ons had not admitted into the modes of warfare.</P>
<P>Henry, eldest son of the empress Maud, came to David at Carlisle, attended by the great barons of the western parts of England, and received the order of knight∣hood
<PB N="72" REF="78"/>with much pomp and ceremony; the young prince then taking an oath, that on his accession to the crown of England, he would confirm to David and his son, their English possessions: but such are the oaths of princes! Henry no sooner grasped the sceptre, than he demanded of the Scotch regency, restitution of Cum∣berland: and in 1158, the two monarchs had an interview in this city; but much dissention arose, and the claim of the English monarch was not complied with.

The greatest part of the city suffered by fire in this reign, and the records and charters were destroyed.

<P>King Henry III. made Robert de Veteripont, governor of this castle and city.</P>
<P>The city suffered greatly by an accidental fire in the year 1292, in which con∣flagration, great part of the cathedral was destroyed, and all the records which the city and convent had procured to be renewed, were also burnt, In the chronicle of Lanercost, is a full account of the dreadful devastations made by this fire.</P>
<P>In 1296, the Scots entered the western march, and having laid the country waste as they approached Carlisle, they burnt the suburbs, and attempted to take the city by storm; but the inhabitants made so brave a defence, even the women mounting the walls, discharging stones, boiling water, and other things on the assailants, that they abandoned their enterprize, and retreated to their own country.</P>
<P>By an entry in the old register book of the abbey, it appears that on the 4th June, 32d King Edward I. half the city was burnt down, as far as the gate of Richardby.</P>
<P>King Edward I. resided here from the 30th of January, in the 35th year of his reign, to the 28th of June, when he proceeded on his last expedition towards Scotland, and died in his camp at Brugh on Sands.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="79"/>In the 9th year of the reign of King Edward II. Robert Brus, King of Scotland, on his incursion laid waste the country as far as Allerdale and Coupland in this county: he besieged Carlisle in a regular form, by engines and other warlike modes, for ten days, and at length was obliged to withdraw his troops in great precipitation, leaving behind them most of their instruments of war. They were hotly pursued by the English; and two of the Scottish leaders, John de Moravia and Sir Robert Bardolph, were taken prisoners, and afterwards ransomed.</P>
<P>In the 15th year of King Edward II. Andrew Harcla, Earl of Carlisle, was seized in the castle, and suffered as a traitor. This action was so gallant, that it appears worth repeating here: the earl was publicly proclaimed a traitor, by the king's command, Anthony, Lord Lucy, was sent to apprehend him. Hav∣ing dispersed his party in the city to prevent suspicion, Lord Lucy, with a few attendants, entered the castle, as having business with the earl: his principal asso∣ciates in this enterprize, were Sir Hugh de Louther, Sir Richard de Denton, and Sir Hugh de Morriceby, with four esquires in arms: the party, to whom the design was communicated, had signals appointed to them for their conduct in the business; and as the knights passed each gate, a number of men halted, as if care∣lessly loitering for want of immediate employment; but with an intention to guard the pass, prevent escapes, and to be at hand to lend their aid if occasion re∣quired. The four chiefs, with their esquires, passed into the innermost, and most secure parts of the castle, even through the great hall, to the earl's private apart∣ment; where, finding him sitting in an unsuspicious manner, Lord Lucy accosted him, requiring him to surrender or defend himself; a cry of treason immediately echoed through the castle, and the keeper of the inner gate prepared to shut it, but was instantly slain by Sir Richard Denton. The watch-word being given, the parties formed into bodies, took possession of the gates and avenues, and the earl, with the whole garrison, surrendered without further bloodshed. The chief pri∣soner was put into safe durance till the king's pleasure relative to him should be known.</P>
<P>In the eleventh year of King Edward III. the Scots laid siege to the city of Carlisle,
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">On John Baliol's doing homage to K. Edw. III. the Scottes having 7 countes in their bande can to Cairluel and brent the suberbes of it.—LEL. COL. v. 1. p. 541.</NOTE> and burnt the suburbs with the hospital of St. Leonards; but the city held out.</P>
<P>Sir William Douglas of Lochmaben was kept in irons in the castle; (an uncom∣mon act of severity towards a prisoner of war) but he was esteemed so enterpriz∣ing and dangerous an enemy by King Edward III. that this was done at his special command.</P>
<P>In the year 1345, Penrith and Carlisle were burnt by the Scots, under the com∣mand of Sir William Douglas. A body of the Scotch forces, headed by Sir Alexander Strachan, detached for foraging, were intercepted; and Sir Alexander was slain by Sir Robert Ogle, who ran him through the body with his lance. Bishop Kirby, the eleventh bishop of this diocese, signalized himself in this rencounter; for being dismounted, and in imminent danger of being made a prisoner; he fought with uncommon bravery, recovered his horse, and by his valour and animating exhortations, he spirited up his party, rallied them frequently, and brought them again to the sight, to which the victory was deservedly attributed.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="80"/>In the sixth year of the reign of King Richard II. the Scots sent forth a plun∣dering band, who ravaged the forest of Inglewood, sacked Penrith at the time of the fair, and returned with a vast booty; having gained, as Hollingshead says, a drove of 40,000 head of cattle.</P>
<P>In the 29th year of King Henry VIII's reign, during Aske's rebellion, Carlisle was besieged by 8000 men, under the command of Musgrave and Tilby, partizans in that affair, but they were repulsed by the garrison; and as they were retiring, were intercepted by the Duke of Norfolk and his troops, who took all the leaders prisoners, except Musgrave; those, with about seventy others, he ordered to im∣mediate execution, and hung them on the city walls.</P>
<P>In the 40th and 41st years of Queen Eilzabeth's reign, this place suffered a dreadful visitation by the plague, in which their died 1196 persons, being com∣puted to be one third of the whole inhabitants. It also raged in the adjacent country with a great mortality, as was mentioned when we spoke of Salkeld and Penrith: for the relief of the diseased poor, contributions were raised for the city, to the amount of 209l. 9s. 10d.</P>
<P>In the twentieth year of the reign of King Charles I. A. D. 1644, this place was surrendered to the parliament forces commanded by Lesley, having sustained a siege and blockade from the 9th of October to June following; during which, the distress of the garrison and inhabitants was so great, that the flesh of horses, dogs, and rats were eaten. Bread was so totally exhausted, that hemp-seed was substi∣tuted, so long as any was found in the place. Great assistance was given by the country, when provisions could be thrown in, to the amount in value of 463l. 10s. procured by private subscriptions. On surrender, honourable terms of capitula∣tion were obtained, both for the military with honours of war, as also for the in∣habitants their liberties and properties.</P>
<P>A coinage of silver pieces of three shillings value took place in the castle during the siege, from the plate of the inhabitants, sent in for that purpose. They are become very scarce, and bear a considerable price with the curious.</P>
<P>The last hostile acts, of which Carlisle was the scene, were those in the Scotch rebellion, 1745. It surrendered to the chevalier on the 14th of November, who lay before it with his whole army. The gazette account of this event, said that for seven days before, neither the officers nor the common men of the garrison got scarce an hour's rest, being perpetually under alarms; that many were so sick through their great fatigue, that being out of all hopes of speedy relief, they absolutely refused to hold out any longer, and multitudes went off every hour over the walls; some of whom fell into the hands of the rebels, till the officers of several companies were at last left with three or four men; so that the mayor and corpo∣ration determined to hang out a white flag (though contrary to the opinion and protestation of Colonel Durand) and made the best terms they could get for them∣selves: that the colonel was thereupon obliged to abandon the castle, not having above seventy invalids in his whole corps, and most of them unfit for service: the rebels threatening, in case of refusal, to sack and destroy the whole town with fire and sword."

On the 27th of that month his troops opened a battery of six eighteen pounders, against the four gun battery of the castle, his Highness putting the match to the first gun; and here he narrowly escaped a cannon shot from the enemy, falling within a yard of him. On the 29th the rebels displayed a flag of truce, and on the thirtieth they accepted the concise terms offered them by his Highness. <Q>All the terms his Royal Highness will, or can grant to the rebel garrison of Carlisle, are, that they shall not be put to the sword, but be reserved for the king's pleasure.</Q> Of the Manchester regiment that surrendered prisoners, there were one colonel, five captains, six lieutenants, seven ensigns, one adjutant, and ninety-three non-commissioned officers, drummers and private men.

<P>The tillage land here bears good crops of wheat, rye, barley, and oats. The mea∣dows are rich, some lands letting from 4l. to 5l. an acre, and upwards.

<HEAD>THE MODERN STATE OF THE CITY OF CARLISLE.
<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><P>We confess our obligations to Mr. R. Longrigg, a native of this city, for this account of the modern state of Carlisle.</P>
<BIBL>THE EDITORS.</BIBL></NOTE></HEAD>
<P>The city of Carlisle (the origin of which is lost in the uncertainties of antiquity) stands upon a pleasing eminence, which having every way a gradual descent, the town is easily kept clean, without the aid of a common shore. Being a frontier town towards Scotland, it is fortified with a wall and citadel now in ruins, and a castle kept still in some sort of repair. Whilst South and North Britain had each their respective king, and the inhabitants of the two kingdoms lived in habits of enmity with each other, Carlisle, exposed to the calamities of war, was often sacked, and its citizens plundered and murdered. Dismal times to live in! The accession of the Stuart family to the crown of England somewhat abated national animosities and miseries; and the union, by conferring reciprocal privileges, and opening a free intercourse between the two countries, has obliterated invidious distinctions, and con∣vinced the people on both sides the Tweed, that their vicinity to each other should have induced their ancestors, always to cultivate habits of amity and friendship with their neighbours.</P>
<P>From the wall, which may be ascended in different parts by flights of steps, the eye is entertained with a beautiful and extensive landscape, and imperceptibly led into several distant counties, whilst Scotland and Solway-Frith
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">And the adjacent mountains, some of whose summits touch the clouds.</NOTE> do not a little contribute to enliven the enchanting scene. The city is surrounded with three rivers, Petteril on the south, Eden on the east and north, and Caude on the west, whose meandering streams are seen in many places at a great distance.—A garrison was formerly kept here; but there has been none for the last thirty years. The military who may be stationed in the town for a time, are quartered upon the public houses in the city and suburbs. Carlisle has still a go∣vernor and deputy governor, whose places are only <HI>sine cures.</HI> A town major, engineer, barrack master, store-keeper, head-gunner, three quarter-gunners, &amp;c. When the governor of this city happened to be one of its representatives in parliament, the subordinate places in the garrison were given to freemen, (but generally to such as were in the corporation) so that frequently the <HI>chief magistrate</HI> was a quarter-gunner at the same time. Thus was the invalid, worn out in the service of his king and country, too frequently overlooked in the disposition of this appointment.</P>
<P>Carlisle being a bishop's see, has a cathedral, in which are performed the cathedral service; in the same edifice is performed the parochial service of St. Mary's: and in a part of it the chancellor of the diocese holds the consistory court. As this religious edifice is the chief ornament of the city, a short description of it may, perhaps, not be deemed improper.</P>
<P>The choir of this venerable pile is the most magnificent part of the building. It has a stately steeple, with a ring of eight bells, the roof is covered with lead, and being considerably higher than the other buildings in the city, has a very sine effect when viewed as a distant object. This noble edi∣fice being partly of Gothic and partly of Saxon architecture, offers what is worthy the inspection of the architect and antiquarian. Contiguous to the cathedral is an extensive church-yard, (the principal bury∣ing ground) surrounded with a wall seven feet high, in the inside of which is a row of lofty plane trees, whose branches overhang a part of the adjacent street and form a shade, under which is a fine paved walk much resorted to. Within the precincts of the abbey, besides the cathedral, there are several ve∣nerable buildings, which (except the prebends' houses) shew marks of antiquity.</P>
<P>St. Cuthbert's, the other parish church in Carlisle, is a modern edifice, rebuilt in the year 1778, upon the site of the old church, but without any kind of external or internal ornament. It has a square steeple or tower, but so confined as not to admit of a ring of bells; so that the parishioners are called together to their devotion by the weak tinklings of the old bell, which was not exchanged for one of a louder tone. The steeple is decorated with a dome covered with lead; from which a fane projects, hav∣the year in which the church was rebuilt cut in it.</P>
<P>Besides these two churches, there are in Carlisle, three Protestant dissenting meeting-houses,
<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Dr. Robert Henry was called and ordained to preach to the Presbyterian congregation in Fisher-street, Carlisle, in November 1748, and continued with them 12 years; and on the 13th of August, he became pastor of a dissenting con∣gregation in Berwick upon Tweed.</NOTE> one Quaker, and one Methodist meeting-house; Wesley's connection.</P>
<P>The public buildings are, the Town-hall, Moot hall, and Council-chamber, conspicuously situated in the centre of the city; and to which you ascend by a slight of broad steps from the promenade. Above the entrance are placed the arms of the corporation. Here are held the criminal and Nisi Prius courts
<PB N="77" REF="84"/>of Assize for the county; the Quarter Sessions, the Mayor's Court, the election for members to repre∣sent the city in parliament, &amp;c. The records and writings belonging to the corporation, the freemen's admissions, &amp;c. are kept in detached offices belonging to the same building.
<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">It is to be lamented that the houses under the Moot-hall are the private property of different persons: to purchase these would require a deal of money. The funds of the corporation are not competent for this; therefore, there are little hopes of ever seeing this edifice become an ornament to the city, by being rebuilt upon a more useful and elegant plan.</NOTE> The council-chamber is ornamented with a cupola and clock. The Guild-hall, in which the free trades hold their meetings, is situate at the head of Fisher-street; and though it has the appearance of antiquity, is but a very mean structure

It seems to be a modern edifice, has a neat appearance, but without any cover: it has the corporation arms cut upon it; underneath which was sculptured, but of late years defaced, a lion with its paw upon a large folio, alluding either to magna charta or the city charter. The guard-house, contiguous to the butcher-market, is a very great nuisance, and hurts the view of the principal streets; and what renders it still more so is, the corporation have granted leases, and built houses adjoining to it, perhaps, upon the royal property. Near the English-gate are charity houses, built by the corporation, in which decayed freemen, or the widows of those deceased, are allowed to live gratis. In Carlisle there is one endowed school.

<P>The corporation of this city consists of a recorder, twelve aldermen, and twenty-four common council∣men.
<NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Present recorder, T. Garforth, Esq.—John Barnes, attorney at law, deputy town-clerk.</NOTE> One of the aldermen is annually chosen mayor, and the other annual place-men are chosen out of the common council. The subordinate officers are three serjeants at mace, five bedals, or town sca∣vengers. The serjeants and bedals wear the corporation livery, and their places are generally for life. The serjeants act as bailiffs in processes before the mayor's court, and to them is committed the execution of summons and writs of arrest for debt issued by it. The office of the bedals is to keep the streets clean, and to put in execution the punishment awarded to offenders within the mayor's jurisdiction. The liberties of the corporation extend a few yards without the city walls, and are ascertained by what is called the Freelidge stone, with their arms sculptured upon it. It may also be proper to observe, that the public and private buildings belonging to the body corporate, have the name of the mayor by whom, and the year in which each edifice was erected, sculptured on some conspicuous part, so that the traveller's eye often catches these words, <HI>"Erected by — Esq. Mayor,"</HI> even upon a mean edifice.</P>
<P>Carlisle, about the beginning of the present century, exhibited no marks of modern convenience and elegance. The buildings, mostly of wood, clay, and laths, bespoke the poverty and bad taste of the in∣habitants. The gabels fronted the streets, the doors were generally in the centre, and many of the houses had porches which projected two or three yards into the street, <HI>doubtless for warmness.</HI> The front door was arched, or Gothic, formed to correspond with the gabel; and the diminutive windows, which gave light to the inner apartments, were very improperly placed, but of the same order.
<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">The most of the houses did not exceed the height of one story, and were chiefly covered with thatch. Those of two stories had the upper rooms inlaid with strong oak, and unceiled below. The lanes and avenues, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ven the church road, were not paved: and in many places entirely covered with weeds and underwood. The streets, not often trode upon, were, in many parts of them, green with grass.</NOTE> The doors were of oak, very strong and clumsy, put together with large wood pins, a part of which projected an inch or two from the door. These pins were many in number, and sometimes placed in figures romanticly irregular. Houses were not then painted either within or without; this being only a modern improve∣ment. The streets, though spacious, were paved with large stones, and the centre part or causeway, rose to a considerable height. The fronts from the houses were paved in the same manner, the consequence of which was, that the kennels or gutters were deep trenches, and stone bridges were placed in many different parts, for the convenience of passing from one side of the street to the other. These gutters were the reservoirs of all kinds of filth, which when a sudden heavy rain happened, by stopping the conduit of the bridges, inundated the streets so, as to render them impassable on foot.</P>
<P>The shambles, which stood in the market place, were private property, and being built entirely of wood and covered with different kinds of slate, gave them a very grotesque and antique appearance. At the north end of the shambles was a well, over which was a building placed upon pillars, called Carnaby's
<PB N="78" REF="85"/>Folly. On the front of each side of this building was the fish market: the Folly and the shambles have been lately taken down, the latter having been purchased, at a great price, by the corporation. The former was their own property. For this the corporation deserve the thanks of the inhabitants of Carlisle, as the shambles, by occupying a great part of one of the principal streets of the city, were a public nuisance.</P>
<P>Little more than half a century ago, the inhabitants of Carlisle carried on no foreign commerce.— Their trade consisted in that of a good weekly market, two annual fairs, and two extraordinary well at∣tended statutes, for hiring servants. The annual fairs in this city, formerly drew together numbers of people from many parts of England and Scotland. The business for the whole year was settled at these meetings; as in many places the intercourse between town and town, or man and man, was not yet car∣ried on by way of port carriers, and other public conveyances. The assize and public diversions con∣tributed greatly to draw together the neighbouring gentry. Though there was very little trade and commerce in this city, yet the inhabitants did not seem to know the want of it. The necessaries of life were uncommonly cheap, and the chief part of their wearing apparel was of their own spinning.— Pride and luxury in eating, drinking, furniture and dress, had not yet made their entrance within the city walls; industry and hospitality were the prominent features of the people. The victuallers brewed their own ale, of a good quality, and sold it for threepence a quart, full measure. And (such was the custom of the place) seldom did a company call for the second pot, without the landlord or landlady presenting them with the fare of the house to relish their liquor. Spirituous liquors were very seldom made use of: though the inhabitants were not opulent, yet many of them had considerable property, and for the most part under a good tenure.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The principal part of the houses in Carlisle are freehold; a few are leasehold under the dean and chapter, and the corporation; and a sew under the king.</NOTE></P>
<P>The town, at the time we are speaking of, was not very populous, and therefore the office of mayor, or chief magistrate, was considered to be of great consequence. He seldom appeared in public without the rod of justice, and had always one of the serjeants to attend him. The baleful seeds of party were not then sown among the inhabitants, a friendly and neighbourly intercourse pervaded the whole city. All the ancient customs were kept up with harmony and festivity, and man united to man by love and good fellowship, circumstanced as the inhabitants were, living in the centre of a rich and well cultivated country, it is no wonder if their minds were free. In ages prior to this aera, they had been exposed to one continued scene of warfare. Under this hazardous situation, it may reasonably be supposed that, their contentions could not lead them to dive much into the mysteries and fluctuations attendant upon a trading intercourse. And suppose they had been in affluent circumstances, it cannot be imagined they would have expended their money in building. Having been so long accustomed to the calamities inci∣dent to war, they wished for nothing more than to enjoy that tranquility, they and their ancestors had been so long strangers to.</P>
<P>This city continued in the situation above-mentioned, without any material alteration either in respect to trade or improvement in building, till the rebellion in 1745. Soon after this period, a company of Hamburgh merchants fixed upon Carlisle as a proper place to carry on an extensive woolen manufactory.
<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">This manufactory was carried on to a very great extent in broad and plain cloths. All the disserent branches of the business, from the sheep shearing to the finishing the pieces, were performed. And as most of the work was done in various parts of the country, the parishes were little affected by an increase of paupers; the purvey then seldom ex∣ceeding twenty or thirty in a year. This was the mode of collecting the poor rate at that time, and for long after.</NOTE> The distance from Lincolnshire, Yorkshire, Scotland, and those parts of the two kingdoms enriched with the staple commodity, was a very inconsiderable object to this company of adventurers. To faci∣litate this undertaking, two gentlemen (brothers) of the name of Dewlicher, were sent over from the continent to superintend the work. This manufactory was of great importance to the inhabitants of Carlisle and the country around. It brought from various parts of the three kingdoms many workmen in the different branches of the woolen trade. People, to the distance of twenty miles from the city were employed, and every loom that could be got was engaged. The most sanguine hopes were enter∣tained, that the undertaking would answer the end proposed: and never were two men engaged in any business more carressed by all ranks of people, than the Dewlichers were. A few years after this manu∣factory was established, the elder brother died, who had taken the most active part of the business upon himself; and who, from its flourishing state during his life, seemed to be every way competent to so great a trust. The younger brother had, sometime prior to the death of the elder, made a very imprudent con∣nection by marriage with the house keeper to the family.
<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Her maiden name was Johnson.</NOTE> This woman was weak and ambitious, and by
<PB N="79" REF="86"/>her was the ruin of this once flourishing manufactory brought about. Having the ascendancy over her credulous husband, she persuaded him to dismiss most of the old workmen, who were overseers, from their employment: these men having been bred to the business, were capable of conduting the different bran∣ches of it. In their places, the relations and acquaintances of the new mistress were substituted, people that knew nothing of the matter. Things soon began to wear a different aspect; the workmen were much dissatisfied with their new masters; quarrels and complaints daily increased, and a very little time put a finishing hand to the whole undertaking: for, by mismanagement on the part of the new foremen, and by the negligence and extravagance of the superintendant and his wife, the company was declared insolvent: and as no person or company would come forward as successors, Carlisle, in a very little time, was reduced to the state it was in at the commencement of this manufactory.
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">All the stock in trade, as wool, yarn, cloth, &amp;c. and all the implements of the work, were sold by auction, at scarcely a fourth part of the value.</NOTE> The failure of this com∣pany was severely felt by many in Carlisle and the neighbourhood; for, as nothing was carried forward as a substitute to employ the industrious poor, those who had been employed in the work were driven to travel with their families to different parts to seek for employment; and for many months nothing but distress appeared around Carlisle for several miles.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Mr. Dewlicher, for many years after, concealed himself in some part of Scotland. Some length of time after the failure of the company, he once ventured, in an obscure manner, into the city, and called late in the evening at the Wool<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> pack-inn, a house much resorted to by the workmen. The landlady's name who then kept the inn, was Mary Carlyle. This hospitable widow entertained him for several days; and taking pity on his indigent circumstances, she, at his depar∣ture, put something handsome into his pocket. He never was, after this, seen or heard of in or about Carlisle.</P></NOTE></P>
<P>During the period we are speaking of, provisions of all kinds were very cheap,
<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><P>Oats, about 2s Carlisle bushel.—Barley, 3s. 4d. do.—Black and white rye, 7s. do.—These two last kinds of grain were the principal bread of the inhabitants.

Very little improvement had taken place in build∣ing, and the streets continued in the same situation. Manure was at this time of so little value, that the corporation gave a man forty shillings a-year, and a new cart occasionally, to take it away once a-week. All the goods which came to this place from Newcastle, were conveyed chiefly upon pack-horses; the roads were impassable the greatest part of the season for any other conveyance. No public works were carried on, except a small manufactory for linen by an Alderman Cook, and a whip manufactory, under the firm of Brown and company, which employed a few paupers. Whips and fish-hooks were the two chief articles in trade Carlisle was noted for.
<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Brown's whips.—Ford's fish-hooks.</NOTE> Great quantit es of coarse linen yarn were weekly exposed in this market for sale, chiefly from the borders and Scotland, where the people grew their own flax, and spun it. This yarn was principally purchased by country weavers, or by people commissioned to buy and send it to manufacturing towns.
<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Those who did not grow their own flax, bought it undressed of the shopkeepers in the city, and slax dressers went about the country, from village to village, and house to house, to dress it.</NOTE></P>
<P>Little increase in population had hitherto taken place. A few foot soldiers and artillery men kept garrison, and these were quartered chiefly upon the public. Carlisle, at this time, kept up the appearance of a formidable place: centries were stationed at every gate, at the commanding-officer's house, the castle, &amp;c. and the gates were shut, and locked every night with much military parade; morning and evening guns were fired as a signal when to open and shut the garrison gates, and pieces of ordnance were placed upon the turrets, situated in different parts of the fortification.</P>
<P>The publicans still continued to brew their own ale, and most of them made their own malt.
<NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">British spirits, viz. Brandy, Gin, Cinnamon, and Anniseed Waters, were now so plenty and cheap, that there was scarcely a gingerbread stall but sold them.</NOTE> It had been a custom for many years backward, for the corporation to demand multure, by compelling the victuallers to grind the malt at their mills. This began to be felt as an oppression; and to remove the grievance, and save the multure, many of them provided small hand mills of their own. The corporation, irritated at this breach of what they deemed their right, refused to grant licences to the refractory inn∣keepers. The public, however, would not comply, but brought an action at law, to compel them to shew upon what grounds so intolerable and arbitrary a custom rested. The action was determined in favour of the victuallers; and this became a heavy stroke to the corporation revenue.
<NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">This action, which was tried at York, besides the loss of their mulcture, was attended with a heavy expence to the body corporate. It seems the corporation did not keep a horse, a bull, and a boar, to substantiate their right to com∣pulsive multure. This, the lord bishop of the diocese, and the dean and chapter of Carlisle, always perform at their ser∣vice mills.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="87"/>About the year 1750, the trade of Carlisle began to have a different appearance. A manufactory of coarse linen cloth, called Osnaburghs was established:
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The late aldermen, Richard and William Hodgson, were the proprietors of this Osnaburgh manufactory.</NOTE> this kind of work can be wrought by women and boys at the loom. About the same time, there arose a new woolen manufactory, chiefly womens' wear, the proprietor of which was a George Blamire. From the time of the Dewlichers, the woolen business had been almost entirely neglected in Carlisle; the little which was done this way, was by three brothers of the name of Machrell, from Yorkshire. Blamire's manufactory was of short duration; and after his time, except what was done by the Machrells, and by one Thorpe, and this to no great amount, the business was no more pursued by any other adventurer.</P>
<P>At the period we are speaking of, the military road between Carlisle and Newcastle was begun. Prior to this date, this road from the city was by the English gate, and Warwick bridge; but now the route was changed, and travellers go by the Scotch-gate. The new road was planned near four miles more to the north than the old one. The badness of the road had hitherto been a great hindrance to the conveyance of merchant goods from Newcastle to this place and Whitehaven: and Dumfries, from this circumstance only, had greatly the advantage: but when this turnpike was completed, then the case was much altered for the better. Large carts and waggons were soon introduced, and nothing was now wanting but a sufficient loading from Carlisle: this want was in some sort supplied by people buying up∣on commission, and others upon their own account, and sending off large quantities of butter and bacon for the London market. It was now that provisions began to rise in price, the butchers to sell their meat by weight, and the country frugal house-wise to throw aside her old pound stone, substituting in its place, the standard of sixteen ounces for weighing her butter. Every article of life increased in value: in the mean time the face of the country began to wear a more cultivated aspect. John Holmes, Esq. who had estates in different parts of the county,
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This gentleman kept in his own hand, and improved, the following valuable estates: Braken, or Brakenhill, Bar∣rockside, Barrockfield, Barronling, Durdar, Ragmire, Brackenhow, Holmhill, all in the neighbourhood of Carlisle; beside<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a very large track of ground in Abbey Holme. Butter, before this time, was generally 20 or 22 ounces to the pound.</NOTE> was a gentleman of a persevering spirit, in making trial of the several modes of agriculture: no part of husbandry was lost in him for the sake of expence, or procuring men used to agricultural improvements. Mr. Holmes' laudable spirit opened the eyes of the country in general, and every succeeding year added something to the former, to the advantage of the industrious husbandman. It has already been observed, that manure was of little value; that what the streets of Carlisle assorded was conveyed away by a person who had an annual salary: it now became an article of value, and the produce of the streets was generally put up to lett along with the corporation lands.
<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">This article now constitutes a part of the corporation revenue, being let, <HI>communibus annis,</HI> for upwards of 50l.</NOTE></P>
<P>The county and city tolls were a part of the corporation revenue. The number of black cattle which came into England from Ireland and Scotland, by the way of Cumberland, and mostly by Carlisle, greatly increased the value of the toll; but as the collecting of it was attended with trouble and danger, the drovers endeavouring to evade this toll as an imposition, it also underwent a trial at law, in which the drovers were defeated, on the grounds that the barrier fortress was still maintained: but as the collecting of this toll from these refractory people, is still attended with difficulty; the person who undertakes the whole farm from the corporation, generally lets it out in parcells to different people, who live most con∣tiguous to the places where the droves take their departure out of the county.</P>
<P>At this period, manufactories of linen and cotton began rapidly to encrease in Carlisle; and this increase in the branches of spinning and weaving brought many Scotch and Irish weavers, with their families, to reside in the city and its environs. The population of the city had encreased very little for forty or fifty years prior to the establishment of these manufactories. The bleaching of yarn was a con∣sequent of these manufactories, and it went on very prosperously. Carlisle is a place very well adapted for carrying on the linen and cotton manufactories to a very great extent. The progress of improve∣ment advanced with rapid steps. Every year houses were rebuilt upon a more elegant plan, and also many new ones. The grass which disfigured the streets, lanes, and avenues, began daily to disappear.</P>
<P>In the year 1756, a brewery commenced in the suburbs of the city, without the Irish Gates, under the firm of Atkinson and Co. But the inhabitants of Carlisle and the neighbourhood, having been long accustomed to home brewed ale, did not relish this factory drink, so that it was sometime before this public brewery met with much encouragement: though after a few years' trial the prejudice was entirely removed, and the success of the undertaking has sufficiently proved its utility, and fully answer∣ed the end the company had in view. The many new manufactories now begun, and the increase of population attendant on them raised the purvey. But as this did not then seem grievous to the ancient
<PB N="81" REF="88"/>inhabitants, I only mention it as a prelude to what afterwards became a severe burthen. Not long after, the streets of the city, and that part of the liberties without the walls, were paved upon a new plan. This alteration for the better (to the great credit of the corporation) removed many intolerable nuisan∣ces. And the inhabitants of the suburbs, and that part of the suburbs which came under the direction of the surveyor of the highways, were also put under a proper regulation. Richardgate felt the good effects of this alteration; being exposed to inundations from the overflowing of the river Eden, it now felt only in part what formerly was almost general.</P>
<P>In the year 1758, were brought here a number of French prisoners from Edinburgh castle. These were soon followed by the regular troops of Thurot's squadron, captured by the brave captain Elliot; and about three or four hundred more were sent to Carlisle, from Launceston in Cornwall. All these prisoners, except Thurot's regulars, were upon their parole of honour. As each of these prisoners had seven shillings a week regularly paid them, this caused a deal of money to be expended. The French prisoners were soon after followed by the Westmorland militia; and as the inhabitants of that county were much prejudiced against a military life, they entered into a voluntary subscription to allow their balloted men, or substitutes, an additional sum to the king's pay, so that many of the privates had from one to three shillings per day. Two companies of invalids kept garrison in the castle;
<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">The militia kept an officer's guard at Cromwell's Green-house.</NOTE> and did also duty as centinels at the several gates. Such a number of men in the city, and so well circumstanced as to money, greatly benefited the place. The consequence of this influx of wealth was, the introduction of more expensive modes of living. Now four wheeled carriages began to run from the different inns.
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Dr. Waugh, Dean of Worcester, a coach and four horses; Major Farrer kept a single horse chaise; Mr. Dobinson a single horse chaise; General Stanwix, a coach and sour horses, when the family was in town, which was but seldom. These were all the private carriages kept in the city at this time.</NOTE> To this period, 1759, there had not been any public conveyance for travellers in post chaise from this city. Hitherto balls and assemblies had been kept in a room at the castle; and when any gave a ball it was chiefly at the Bush Inn: but now an assembly room is built, and finished for that purpose, in a plain and neat manner.</P>
<P>The year 1761 saw new works established. A company from Newcastle begun the calico printing business, which has been progressively carried on ever since, and affords employment to many hundreds of men, women, and children. This was followed by an extensive manufactory, carried on by the in∣genious Bernard Barton, whose premature death deprived the public of the abilities of an able and enterprising tradesman. These public works employed a great deal of good land about the city, so that the value of ground, either in the selling price or in letting, rose considerably: and the increase of population, owing to these causes, may reasonably be supposed to occasion an equal rise in every other article bought and sold.</P>
<P>As the year 1761 was an aera of real advantage to Carlisle, both with respect to the prospect of an increasing commerce and the further progress of politics; the reader, we hope, will not deem it impro∣per, that we are a little more particular. The printing or stamping of Calico was introduced here about this period. Gentlemen from Newcastle and its vicinity, under the firm of Scot, Lamb, and Co. were the first establishers of this branch of trade, in the environs of Carlisle. And as the Calico business has been the principal means of increasing the population of the city, it is sufficient to remark that the flourishing advances of this manufactory induced others to form themselves into companies to begin and carry on the same business. Some of them were men unacquainted with commerce; for in former times a country Esq. would have thought it a degradation of his rank, to have his name entered with any company in a manufacturing or mercantile line. Time has removed this prejudice, and men are convinced that trade enriches, in particular, those engaged in it, and the public in general. Common day labour for men not bred to any mechanic trade, and lint or two spinning for women in indigent circumstances, was all the employment that could be obtained. Eight pence or ten pence a day, without victuals, was as much as a labourer could earn, and a woman must have worked very hard at her wheel to make a shilling a week, The employment for children was winding pirns for weavers or twisting whips, for which they had only about eight pence per week, and generally worked sixteen hours out of the twenty∣four.</P>
<P>The establishment of the calico manufactory greatly altered the case. The work in the green or bleach∣yard found employment for men and stout boys. Apprentices were taken to the several branches of the work, viz. Drawers, Cutters, and Calico printers, at a genteel weekly allowance, and their wages in∣creased as they advanced in their servitude. Little boys were employed as tearing boys to the printers.
<PB N="82" REF="89"/>Women had tables set out for them to pencil the colours into the pieces. Every table employed three or four female children; and even the youngest boys and girls could make near two shillings per week. Such encouragement brought numbers of families out of the country into the city and suburbs, and so great was the change, that a common labourer, who probably, with his wife's assistance, did not make above eight shillings weekly, could, by having his family fixed in the manner represented, easily earn twenty or thirty shillings a week. Nay, such was the infatuation of the young men, or desire of great wages, that many who had served an apprenticeship to a mechanic trade, bound themselves a new to the stampery; and even those that were married followed the same steps, persuaded that this manufactory would give the whole family bread. People of property reaped their advantage from this increase of population, as land and houses increased in value.</P>
<P>The several manufactories began to thrive much beyond the most sanguine expectation. People in trade, with little to begin with, acquired fortunes which enabled them to live in a much more splendid style than formerly. The town rapidly improved, and the land around increased in value, far beyond what could have been foreseen. The advantages, however, were balanced by some inconveniences: people of pro∣perty, who tasted not the sweets of a thriving trade, began to feel the disadvantages which arose from the increase of population. Before the year 1761, the poor rates were not felt by those who paid them: forty purveys in a year was the annual collection. This was the mode pursued, and the inhabitants acted in the office of collecting by rotation. But the increase of manufactories invited numbers of strangers here for bread. The town was soon filled with Scotch and Irish families; and as these people had no place to return to, in case of indigence and sickness, they became a great burthen upon the ancient inha∣bitants. This was not the only grievance; the mode of collection was very irregular, being still by the old rate. New improvements did not pay any kind of proportion, nor did the manufacturers, though those were the only people that throve by this increase of trade, and the cause which brought these stran∣gers to the city, pay any kind of rate for their valuable stocks in trade. This caused a general murmur amongst the ancient inhabitants, and a redress was loudly called for. A pound rate was thought to be the most equitable mode, and after many vestry meetings it was finally agreed to. All this time, neither the parish of St. Mary, or St. Cuthbert, had a common workhouse: the poor were either let out, or paid out, in their own houses. The parish of St. Mary seeing the disadvantage which arose from this mode of providing for the poor, entered into a subscription to build a workhouse; the good effects of which have been felt by the inhabitants, as well as by the poor that receive the benefit.</P>
<P>The chief part of the manufactoring business before the year 1761, consisted of a few check and Osna∣burg looms, and about a dozen of looms employed in weaving very fine linen. But after the establish∣ment of the manufactory of printed or stamped calicoes, cotton looms were set up. The stamperies had before this, been supplied with cottons from Lancashire, at an extraordinary expence in carriage; but now machinery for carding, roving, and spinning of cotton, is erected in different places in the neigh∣bourhood of the city, and they purchase their cottons at a cheaper rate. This machinery employs a great number of men and women, of old and young. Buildings, particularly in the environs, have a∣mazingly increased, and so has every trade in proportion.—We shall now only paticularize the different employments:—</P>
<P>At present there are four printfields which employ about one thousand people, and pay above 20,000l. annually to the revenue. Their firms are Messrs. Lamb, Scot, Forster, and Co.—Messrs. Losh and Co. Messrs. Mitchell, Ellwood, and Co —Messrs. Donald, Carrick, Shaw, and Co.—Messrs. Wood and Co. who employs above two hundred people in spinning of cotton.—Messrs. Forsters have the most extensive manufactory in the north of England, in all the branches from the raw materials to the finishing of checks, calicoes, muslins, and all kinds of fancy work.—Messrs. Fergusons are next in extent in similar articles.—Messrs. Langcake, M<SUP>c</SUP>William, and Co. manufacturers in similar articles.—Messrs. Stoddards, ditto—Mr. Thomas Pearson, ditto.—Mr. Nixon, ditto.—Messrs. Wilson and Co. muslins. —Besides the brewery previously mentioned, a few years after another was established near it, now under the firm of Messrs. Pattrickson and Co. and lately Mr. Daniel Pattinson erected another; these three breweries pay above 6000l. duty annually; and just now there is another erected by Mr. Haugh.— There is a soapry under the firm of Messrs. Barker and Langcake, which pays about 1500l. duty annually; when thereto is added the duties upon candles, leather, licences, and other things under the excise, Car∣lisle pays above 100,000l. annual revenue.—Besides these public works, there are many others on a smaller scale; and all the common trades are carried on to great perfection.</P>
<P>The late Mr. Forster and sons established a bank here, and Mr. Wilson another, which is of great service to trade.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="90"/>WAGES, within these twelve months, have rose, much owing to the advance in all the necessaries of life.—Calico printers make from one and a half, to two guineas per week; carpenters, joiners, masons, and bricklayers here 2s. 6d. per day; labourers, from 1s. to 1s. 8d.; weavers earn from 10s. to 1l. 1s. per week, according to their abilities; and the same with all the other trades.—For the former rate of wages, provisions, &amp;c. see our account of Brampton, being nearly the same, vol. I. page 131.</P>
<P>FRIENDLY SOCIETIES were established here about twenty years ago, and are now seven for men and three for women; consisting of about twelve hundred members. A number of gentlemen are joined to these societies, which add much to their respectability, and strengthens their funds: their allowance to sick and old members is in proportion to their funds; and members or their relatives are genteely buried at the society's expence.—There are two masonic societies consisting of a number of respectable people.</P>

<HEAD>Further Particulars respecting Carlisle Market.</HEAD>
<P>LAMB, in the early part of the season, sells for 1s. 3d. per lb. but continues lowering in value as it becomes less rare, till it may be bought for 3d halpenny, and 3d. per lb. From Christmas till a∣bout Lady-Day, ten to twelve carcases of beef are weekly disposed of in the market: from that time till Martinmas, sixteen to eighteen may be sold per week; and from Martinmas to Christmas, thirty-five to forty per week. The rea∣son why the number increases so much in the latter period, is a prevalent custom among the people in the neighbouring country, of buying a quantity of beef at that season to salt and dry for the winter's use.—Salmon is caught in large quantities in the Eden, near Carlisle: it becomes in season the beginning of December, but as it brings a high price in London, Manchester, &amp;c. few purchasers are found here while it continues at about 2s. per lb. but as the season advances, the prices drop; because, in warm weather, it can∣not be sent to a distance, and is there∣fore sold in the neighbourhood at about 3d. per pound. In the autumn salmon is generally cheapest, when several of the middling and lower classes of people salt and dry it: in that state, we presume, it affords a very unwholsome food, tending to occasion scurvies and other impurities of the blood.</P>
<P>FUEL, is coal from Blenkinsop,
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Blenkinsop is the property of a Mr. Coulson.</NOTE> Talkin, and Tindale-Fells, distant twenty, twelve, and fifteen miles to the east, and are the property of the Earl of Carlisle. Coal from the first mentioned place has the preference. That article is brought from the pits to market in single horse carts,
<PB N="84" REF="91"/>and disposed of, neither by weight or measure, but by the cart load; consequently a very discriminating eye is necessary to prevent being imposed on.—Coals that are sold by dealers, are commonly 5d. the Carlisle peck —Peats from Scaleby and Roweliff mosses, distant five miles, ten for a penny.</P>
<P>PUBLIC INNS here have good accommodation, both in rooms and stabling.—The Bush-Inn, English∣street, and Crown and Mitre, Castle street, are the houses the mail-coaches put up at: the King's Arms, Grapes, Blue Bell, and Duke's Head, are also much resorted to by travellers: there are several other good inns, both in the city and suburbs.</P>
<P><HI>The Mail-Coaches and other public Carriages are numerous here.</HI>—Two mail-coaches set out every morning for London, one by Manchester and the other by Borrowbridge: a heavy coach is also for∣warded to the metropolis every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.—A mail-coach every afternoon to Glasgow, and a mail diligence at the same time to Dumfries.—A diligence goes from this to Edinburgh every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday; and to Newcastle on Sundays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Fridays; and one to Whitchaven on Saturdays—The arrivals are in proportion to their several distances.</P>
<P>WAGGONS AND CARTS for the conveyance of goods are exceeding numerous here, being the great thorough-fair between England and Scotland: in this branch of commerce there are above two hundred horses employed: and as most of the goodsstood in the public streets during the market, great inconvenience was felt; now each are getting private warehouses; and it is much to be wished that a proper market∣place was provided for the butchers, as their shambles greatly incommode the streets.</P>
<P>LITERATURE.] In this department, Carlisle can boast of many literary productions; and, perhaps, there are few towns in this kingdom where literature has flourished more than it has done here of late years.—We shall mention only the names of the authors and their works.</P>
<P>The Rev. W. Paley, D. D. Archdeacon of this diocese, published, while he resided in this city, Moral and Political Philosophy; Horae Paulinae; Reasons for Contentment; a View of the Evidence of Christianity, and Occasional Sermons; all which works, as they possess a high degree of celebrity, so have been well received by a discerning public.—The Rev B. Grisdale, D. D. two occasional sermons. —The Rev. J. D. Carlyle, B. D. Chancellor of this diocese, Prose and Poetical Translations from the Arabic.—The Rev. R. Miln, A. M. dissenting minister, Lectures upon the Antedeluvian World, and Occasional Sermons.—The Rev. G. Thomson, ditto, the Spirit of Modern History, and Occasional Sermons.—R. Harrington, M. D. several Treatises upon Air, Phlogiston, &amp;c.—J. Heysham, M. D. a Treatise upon the Jail Fever, Bills of Mortality, &amp;c.—Mark Lonsdale, poems, and pieces adapted for the theatre.</P>
<P>ARTS, SCIENCES, &amp;c.] These have kept pace with the other improvements of this city.—Guy Head, an ingenious artist; who, from the years of infancy, manifested a strong genius in painting and drawing; and to a fancy bold and vigorous, joined assiduity, rarely concentrated in one person. The talents of this gentleman are now likely to reflect honour on his native city, as he has been for some years resident in Italy, for the purpose of studying the excellent remains of the Italian masters.—Robert Smirke, Esq. R. A. historical painter, is a native of this county, and passed many of his juvenile years at Carlisle, where his father then resided, he gave some proofs of that genius which has since placed him at the head of one of the most exalted departments of his profession—Robert Carlyle excells in drawing antiquities and copying: his drawing of the cathedral of Carlisle, and other antiquities, are specimens of his abilities this way, and do him credit, as they gained him the silver medal from the society for the encourage∣ment of the arts, &amp;c.—James Lowes, a self-taught draughts-man and engraver, whose first attempts as an artist, are coeval with the commencement of this history, and his improvement is to be traced in the work: we can always vouch for the accuracy, if not the elegance, of all his works.—John Howard, a native of this city, at present a teacher of Mathematics in Newcastle, is well known to all the lovers of that science. He has the most extensive knowledge of all the parts of mathematical learning, and is a self-taught genius. Robert Bowman, a pupil of his, (blind from his infancy) is also a rare instance of genius: he is a perfect master of the higher branches of the mathematics.—Joseph Strong, blind from his infancy, is a musician and an artist: in the latter capacity he constructed a tolerable well toned organ, and is a great proficient in fancy-weaving. So true it is, that with a sound judgment, a ready apprehen∣sion, and strong imagination, great progress may be made without sight in the arts and sciences.—Edward Foster, clock-maker, has constructed a clock and planetarium, upon an extensive and variegated scale. It is the production of twenty years' study and labour: its dimensions are nine feet high, five feet broad, three feet deep; and consists of four principal parts: 1st, It shews the seconds, minutes, and hours of the day; the fasts and festivals; the equation of time; the perpetual day of the month; the place of the moon's nodes, or the part of the ecliptic intersected by her orbit. 2d, The Copernic, or true solar system

<P>1779. THE advantages which may be derived from accurate registers of mortality, are thus illustrated by an ingenious philosopher and physician. <Q>The establishment of a judicious and accurate register of the births and burials, in every town and parish, would be attended with the most important advantages, medical, political, and moral. By such an institution, the increase or decrease of certain diseases; the comparative healthiness of different situations, climates, and seasons; the influence of particular trades and manufactures on longevity; with many other curious circumstances, not more interesting to physicians than beneficial to mankind, would be ascertained with tolerable precision. In a political view, exact registers of human mortality are of still greater consequence, as the number of people, and progress of population in the kingdom, may, in the most easy and unexceptionable manner, be deduced from them. They are the foundation, likewise, of all calculations concerning the values of assurances on lives, reversionary payments, and of every scheme for providing annuities for widows, and persons in old age. In a moral light also, such <HI>Tables</HI> are of evident utility, as the increase of vice or virtue may be determined, by observing the proportion which the diseases arising from luxury, in∣temperance, and other similar causes bear to the rest; and in what particular places distempers of this class are found to be most fatal.</Q>—<HI>Percival's Essays, vol.

The situation is rendered exceedingly pleasant by its vicinity to three beautiful rivers, with which it is almost surrounded, viz. the Eden on the north east side, Petteral on the south east, and Caldew on the north-west. The air about Carlisle is pure and dry, the soil chiefly sand and clay. No marshes or stagnant waters corrupt the atmosphere; its neighbourhood to a branch of the sea, and its due distance from the mountains on all sides, render the air temperate and moderate.</P>
<P>In July 1763, at the request of Dr. Littleton. Lord Bishop of Carlisle, the inhabitants were numbered with great care and attention by the Rev. Mr. Richardson, the Rev. Mr. Simpson, and Mr. Alderman Hodgson. There were at that time in the city and suburbs, 1059 families, and 4158 inhabitants.</P>
<P>In January 1780, a very careful and accurate survey was made by Mr. Stanger and Mr. Howard, under my own inspection. When there were in the district, before surveyed, 891 houses, 1605 families, and 6299 inhabitants—For a more particular account of the survey.—See Tables I. II. III.</P>
<P>This astonishing increase of 2141 inhabitants, which is above half of the original number, in the small space of seventeen years, may, in some measure, be attributed to the establishment of manufactories.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="97"/>This increase of population too has taken place, during that very period in which Dr. Price asserts the depopulation of Great Britain to have been rapid and progressive: and what makes this increase more remarkable, Carlisle has, during the whole period alluded to, been constantly supplying the army, the navy, the metropolis, and even the distant regions of India, with her hardy, active, and enterprizing sons.</P>
<P>From tables, number IV. V. and VI. we can with pleasure demonstrate the extreme salubrity of Carlisle, even in a very unhealthy year; a year in which no less than 129 persons were cut off by two epidemic disorders, viz. the small pox and scarlet fever. By the bills of mortality published in different towns in England, as well as the continent, it appears on an average, that in Vienna about 1 in 19 and a half of the inhabitants die annually; in London, 1 in 20 and three quarters; in Edinburgh, 1 in 20 and four fifths; in Leeds, 1 in 21 and three fisths; in Dublin, 1 in 22; in Rome, 1 in 23; in Amsterdam, 1 in 24; in Breslaw, 1 in 25; in Berlin, 1 in 26 and a half, in Northampton and Shrewsbury, 1 in 26 and a half; in Liverpool, 1 in 27 and a half; in Manchester, 1 in 28; in Chester, 1 in 40; but in the year 1774, when the small pox were very general and fatal, 1 in 27; and in the parish of Sedburgh, in the county of York, 1 in 37 and a half; and in Blandford Forum in Dorset, 1 in 39; in Carlisle, this year, 1 in 30 and three ninths—See Table VII.</P>
<P>Tables, number III. V. and VI. are of the utmost importance to the physician, the politician, and the calculator of annuities, and to every one who has the health and happiness of himself and family at heart. They clearly demonstrate, as far as one year's observation can have weight, what periods of life are the most healthy, what are the most obnoxious to disease.</P>
<P>As no particular epidemic disease occurred last year, which had any considerable effect on the lives of adult persons, it is apprehended these calculations for the periods above ten years old, will not be attend∣ed with much variation in other years.</P>
<P>That women in general live longer than men, is almost universally agreed, and the following observa∣tions tend much to confirm the truth of this opinion. During the last year twelve persons died between eighty and ninety years old, eight of these were females, and between ninety and a hundred, two died, both females.—See table VI. In table III. we see two people are above 100 years old, and these like∣wise are females.</P>
<P>Table II. which contains the number of husbands, wives, &amp;c. shews how inferior in number widowers are to widows. There are above four widows to one widower: an astonishing disproportion; in what manner is it to be accounted for? The following causes are conceived to operate considerably:</P>
<P>1st, Men are, in general, more intemperate than women. 2d, They are exposed to greater hardships and dangers. 3d, Widowers, perhaps, in general, have greater opportunities of getting wives, than wi∣dows have of getting husbands. 4th, Widows have a greater propensity to live in towns than widowers.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Women, in general, and more especially among the middle ranks of life, marry earlier than men.</NOTE> 5th and lastly, The constitutions of males, as fitted for more violent and laborious exertions, are firmer and more robust than those of females: their muscular and nervous fibres, may therefore be supposed to become stiff, rigid, and incapable of performing the functions necessary to health and life sooner than those of females, both on account of their original texture, and the friction which must necessarily occur from laborious exercise. But from whatever causes the difference of longevity betwixt males and females may arise, the fact itself is sufficiently ascertained by table VI. where we find, that between the ages of sixty and seventy, although there are a greater number of wives than husbands, yet eleven husbands and only four wives have died, and of all different ages twenty-nine husbands and sixteen wives.</P>
<P>During this year two epidemics raged with uncommon violence, and swept off a great number of chil∣dren, viz. the small pox, and a species of the scarlet fever.</P>
<P>As the persons affected with the small pox were chiefly of the lower class, who seldom called in medical assistance, it is impossible to ascertain the precise number: from the information, however, which I have had, it appears, that about 300 were, during the last six months of the year, seized with the small pox in the natural way: of these no less than ninety fell victims to its virulence. Hence, near one in three died of all that were affected with the natural small pox; which, while at the same time, it serves as a melan∣choly proof of its fatal effects, points out the great and salutary advantages which are derived from ino∣culation. During the same period several hundreds were inoculated in the neighbourhood of Carlisle, and it is a pleasing truth, that not one of them died. Had those 300 been inoculated, it is more than probable, that of the ninety not above six would have died; and even these not of inoculation, but of other disorders. Hence we see eighty-four persons might have been saved to their parents and the public. Yet so great is the prejudice against the salutary practice of inoculation amongst the vulgar, that
<PB N="87" REF="98"/>few, very few, can be prevailed upon, either by promises, rewards, or intreaties, to submit to the opera∣tion. No wonder, that in rude, ignorant, and barbarous times, superstition hurried men into the grossest absurdities; when in a polished and enlightened age, in an age too, when the experience of full twenty years has clearly demonstrated the utility of inoculation, we see the bulk of mankind ready to sacrifice their children, and all that is dear to them, to a foolish prejudice.</P>
<P>FOR THE YEAR 1780.] The population of Great Britain must ever be a subject deserving the atten∣tion of every lover of his country, and especially since the commencement of the present war, it has be∣come highly interesting.</P>
<P>Within these few years, some very able writers have published their thoughts and calculations on this subject. Those who are willing to depreciate the resources of this country, and to magnify those of our enemies, have endeavoured to persuade us, that our situation is truly lamentable, and that population has rapidly and progressively decreased for this twenty or thirty years past.</P>
<P>The data from which these calculations and inferences have been made, are principally the returns of the window surveyors, and the books of the customs and excise.</P>
<P>Others, who from different sources of information, have attempted to confute such sentiments, have presented us with a more favourable picture; they, with much appearance of truth, have endeavoured to prove, that the number of inhabitants in Great Britain, instead of decreasing, has considerably increased, during the period above alluded to. In support of the latter hypothesis, I think it may not be improper to mention the following facts:—</P>
<P>In the beginning of the year 1780, I made an actual, and I believe an accurate, survey of the two pa∣rishes, St. Mary's and St. Cuthbert's, and found they contained 1148 houses, 1872 families, and 7677 inhabitants
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See last year's observations on the bills of mortality for Carlisle.</NOTE> A few months afterwards, another actual survey was made of the two parishes, by Mr. Coulson, general surveyor of the four northern counties for the window-tax, and Mr. William Monkhouse, surveyor of Cumberland, Leith, and Eskdale wards; and though I have every reason to apprehend, that their survey was much more accurate, than surveys for the window-tax heretofore have been, yet they only returned 815 houses; the difference therefore between the real number of houses, and the number returned to the window-tax is 333. Now, to shew how fallacious all calculations are, with respect to the number of inhabitants in any particular place, founded on the returns of the surveyors of the window-tax, even when they make the most accurate survey. Let us suppose I had wanted to ascertain the number of inhabitants in Carlisle and the adjoining villages, and had been ignorant of the real number of houses which they contained, I should have multiplied 815 by 6 and two thirds, which is nearly the number of people in each house, the product will be 5433 nearly, which is 2244 less than the real number or two sevenths nearly of the whole. And if I had been ignorant of the number of inhabitants in each house, I should most probably have multiplied 815 by 6, which would have made the difference still more consi∣derable.</P>
<P>The salubrity of Carlisle was proved by the bills of mortality published last year; and it appears still more evident from the present, for only 1 in 34 and a half nearly, of all the inhabitants have died this year, in consequence of diseases—See Table VII.</P>
<P>Table VI. coroborates the observations made in the last year's bills, viz. that women live longer than men; for between 100 and 103 years old, two persons died, who were both females; 26 husbands, and only 15 wives have died, although there are a greater number of wives than husbands in Carlisle.</P>
<P>FOR THE YEAR 1781.] People of all ranks, ages, and conditions of life, enjoyed an uncommon de∣gree of health during the first three months of this year; for, within that period, no more than twenty-three persons died; and of these, fifteen were either very young children, or old and infirm. But about the beginning of April, a very epidemic fever, evidently the <HI>Typhus Carcerum,</HI> began to make its appearance. It broke out in a house in Rickergate, which contains about half a dozen very poor families; the rooms are exceeding small, and in order to diminish the window-tax, every window, that even poverty could dispense with, was shut up: hence stagnation of air, which was rendered still more noxious by the filth and uncleanliness of the people. The surgeon who attended some of those poor wretches, told me, the smell was so offensive and disagreeable, that it was with difficulty he could stay in the house, while he inquired into the situation of his patient. One of the persons affected with the fever in this house was a weaver, who, on his recovary, went to his usual employment at a large work-shop, where he communi∣cated the disorder to his fellow-weavers, and from thence the fever spread all over the town. It, however, chiefly. I may almost say entirely, raged amongst the common and lower ranks of people, and more espe∣cially amongst those who lived in narrow, close, confined lanes, and in small, crowded apartments. It
<PB N="88" REF="99"/>affected adults more frequently than children; the infirm, than the robust; women than men; and the married were more subject to it than the single. Three or four persons in a family were frequently seized with it, one after another. It was almost altogether confined to this place, none being seized with it ever in the neighbouring villages, except in a very few instances, where the feeds of it were evidently carried by some persons who had laboured under the disease. In the short space of about eight months, near five hun∣dred persons were affected with this fever, forty-eight of whom died; of these, one was under five years o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> age; two between five and ten; one between ten and fifteen; two between fifteen and twenty; one be∣tween twenty and thirty; eight between thirty and forty; thirteen between forty and fitty; twelve between fifty and sixty; six between sixty and seventy; two between seventy and eighty years.</P>
<P>The small pox were constantly in town all this year, but made little or no progress till towards th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> latter end of October, when they became rather more general, but they could scarce ever be said to rag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> as an epidemic: nineteen only died. No other epidemic appeared, and indeed, excepting the jail fever this year was by no means unhealthy. Great numbers were inoculated both in the town and country villages.</P>
<P>During the present year, 1 in 38 and 3 fifths of all the inhabitants have died in consequence of dis∣eases—See Table VII.</P>
<P>The difference of the number of deaths of husbands and wives, is not near so great as it was in the years 1779 and 1780; yet still the deaths of the former exceed those of the latter by two; for thirty three husbands and only thirty-one wives have died, which difference is not the less extraordinary than i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the two preceding years, when we consider, in the first place, that the constitutions of women are more predisposed to be acted upon by the contagion of the Jail Fever than those of men; and in the second that they are, from their habits and situations in life, infinitely more exposed to that contagion. Between eighty and ninety years of age, five males and four females, and between ninety and an hundred, three females have died.—See Table VI.</P>
<P>FOR THE YEAR 1782.] Upon the whole, this year, notwithstanding it was so extremely cold and wet cannot be considered as an unhealthy one. The <HI>Typhus Carcerum,</HI> or <HI>Jail Fever,</HI> which raged with so much violence last year, gradually declined, and was scarcely to be met with after May. Sixteen persons died of it.</P>
<P>And although the small pox were constantly in town, yet they were neither general nor very fatal▪ Thirty persons only died of that disease.</P>
<P>In the beginning of June, the <HI>Catarrhus Contagiosus</HI> or <HI>Influenza</HI> became general; very few families either in the town or country, escaping its influence. It is, perhaps, the most contagious of all disorders to which the human body is subject; and were it as fatal as it is infectious, it would soon depopulate the world. When it once breaks out, it does not, like the small pox, the plague, or the jail fever, confine itself to a city, a province, or a kingdom; but traverses whole continents, and is sometimes wafted across the Atlantic Ocean. It has raged no less than eleven or twelve times as an epidemic in Europe, within the present century, and pretty generally exhibits the same phoenomena; yet no barrier has hitherto been discovered to arrest its progress; nor have the causes which first produced it at each period, been yet ascertained. Fortunately, however, it is a very mild disease, differing little from the common catarrh or cold, except that the febrile symptoms are more constant and rather more severe. The Influenza attacked every age, sex, and apparently people of every habit; yet it is evident, a predisposition was required, as several, and among the rest myself, who were frequently exposed to the contagion, escaped the disease. In what that predisposition consists, remains yet to be discovered. It finished its course in the neighbour∣hood of Carlisle, in about the space of three weeks or a month; and its symptoms were here so mild, that medical advice was seldom sought for. One person only is supposed to have died of it in Carlisle, viz. a woman sixty-five years of age. During this year 1 in 38 of all the inhabitants have died in con∣sequence of diseases.—See Table VII.</P>
<P>Hitherto the number of deaths of husbands, has considerably exceeded those of wives, each year: but during the present year, the deaths of wives somewhat exceed; for twenty-two wives, and only twenty husbands have died.—See Table VI.</P>
<P>Between eighty and ninety years of age, five males and nine females; and between ninety and a hun∣dred, one male and two females have died; between a hundred and one, and a hundred and two years of age, one female, viz a widow, died during the present year.—See Table VI.</P>
<P>In the month of August not one person died in the parish of St. Cuthbert, a circumstance which has not occurred these twenty years.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="100"/>FOR THE YEAR 1783.] The present year has been much more healthy, than any of the preceding years; on which, observations on the bills of mortality in Carlisle have been made: for, notwithstanding the number of inhabitants has considerably increased, yet the number of deaths is by no means so great, one hundred and eighty one persons only have died.</P>
<P>No dangerous or fatal epidemic, except the small pox, raged with any degree of violence.—The wea∣ther, during the latter end of June, the whole of July, and part of August, was extremely hot and sultry; the atmosphere was replete with the electric fluid; and there was more thunder and lightening than ever was remembered, even by the oldest person. This state of the atmosphere was by no means peculiar to the neighbourhood of Carlisle, but was pretty universal throughout Europe.</P>
<P>In September and October, the small pox became so general, and were of so fatal a kind, that the monthly committee of the dispens<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry were of opinion, that a general inoculation of the poor and indi∣gent inhabitants, would be attended with very beneficial effects. Early in the month of November, a ge∣neral inoculation accordingly took place. Great numbers were inoculated, not only by the surgeon to the dispensary, but also by most of the other surgeons in the town. By this salutary measure the city of Carlisle was, in the space of two months, totally freed from a most dangerous and fatal disorder which has been raging in different parts of the county with the utmost violence. The number of persons affected with the natural small pox in Whitehaven, within the last six months, have been almost incredible, and it is a melancholy truth, that scarcely one in three survived. In Wigton and its neighbourhood they have been also extremely general and fatal.</P>
<P>Twenty nine husbands and twenty three wives have died this year.—See Table VI.</P>
<P>Between eighty and ninety years of age, four males and seven females, six of whom were widows; and between ninety and an hundred, one male and one female have died.—See Table VI.</P>
<P>Nineteen only fell victims to the small pox, and seventeen of these were children under five years of age.</P>
<P>A poplexies were remarkably frequent this year; no less than nine persons having died of that dis∣temper.—The number of deaths were remarkably equal during all the seasons; forty-seven died in winter, forty-two in the spring, forty five in the summer, and forty-seven in autumn.—See Table IV.</P>
<P>During the present year, 1 in 43 and 1-7th of all the inhabitants have died in consequence of diseases. —See Table VII.</P>
<P>FOR THE YEAR 1784.] In the observations on the bills of mortality for last year, I took notice of the extreme healthiness of that season; it is, however, with peculiar satisfaction I am able to inform the public, that it has been far exceeded in salubrity by the present.</P>
<P>One hundred and fifty-four persons only have died, which are fewer by twenty-seven than died last year; and in the year 1779, the number swept off by two diseases only, viz. the small pox and scarlet fever was nearly equal to the whole number of deaths this year, whether occasioned by diseases or acci∣dents.</P>
<P>This remarkable degree of healthiness may be accounted for, from the absence of almost all epidemical disorders; for not one made its appearance except the small pox, which were of a very mild kind, and proved fatal to no more than ten persons, nine of whom were under five years of age. How to account for the absence of all other epidemic and contagious diseases, is not so easy.</P>
<P>With respect to the weather, I shall only remark that the present year commenced and ended with the severest and longest continued frosts ever remembered since the year 1740. The summer too was uncom∣monly cold and wet, and yet was the healthiest season, as may be seen by examining table IV.</P>
<P>Whether the severity of the frost had any effect in purifying the air, and hence rendering it unfavour∣able to the propagation, &amp;c. &amp;c. of epidemical disorders, perhaps, may be doubted; but it certainly ope∣rated most powerfully in the production of an obstinate cutaneous disease, by physicians denominated, Herpes; but by the common people and empiries, called Scurvy, though it is essentially different from that disorder.</P>
<P>This cutaneous complaint, viz. Herpes, has been extremely prevalent, and remarkably obstinate these two last winters, and has appeared under a variety of forms.</P>
<P>The number of deaths of husbands still continues to exceed that of wives, and this year in a very great proportion, for twenty nine husbands have died, but only twenty wives.—See Table VI.</P>
<P>Four widowers, and twenty-four widows have died.</P>
<P>Between eighty and ninety years of age, four males and nine females, eight of whom were widows; and between ninety and an hundred, one male and three females have died.—See Table VI.</P>
<P>Hitherto the number of males born has exceeded the number of females; but this year it is the reverse, for 121 males and 153 females have been christened.—See Table VIII.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="101"/>During this year, 1 in 50 and 1-6th nearly, of all the inhabitants have died in consequence of diseases. —See Table VII.</P>
<P>FOR THE YEAR 1785.] The present year, like the last, was ushered in by a very severe and long con∣tinued frost. There was also a considerable fall of snow; and a complete thaw, which was slow, gradual, and without rain, did not take place till near the middle of April. The thaw was succeeded by cold easterly winds, which continued a long time; and a greater degree of drought was scarcely ever remem∣bered. The fields were parched, the springs and rivers were almost dried up, circumstances not to be wondered at, when we consider that there was no rain, a very few slight showers excepted, from the month of October, 1784, till the 29th of July. On that day we had, in the neighbourhood of Carlisle, a great deal of thunder and lightning, accompanied by a most violent and heavy rain; and from that time, till near the end of the year, the weather became moist and warm.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding this long continued drought, the weather was never exceedingly hot or sultry; which may probably be the reason why dangerous disorders were not more prevalent. For this year was far from being unhealthy, no epidemic diseases occurring, but such as had arisen before the dry and warm season came on; which, therefore, could have no effect in producing them.</P>
<P>Very early in the month of January, the jail fever, which I believe first originated among the felons confined in the jail, began to make its appearance in the city, and continued to rage almost the whole of the year. As the poorest class of inhabitants chiefly suffered from it: its progress, &amp;c. will be best as∣certained by examining the books of the dispensary, where I find four patients, labouring under the dis∣order, were admitted in the month of January; four in February; four in March; three in April; eight in May; eight in June; ten in July: fifteen in August; nineteen in September; eleven in Octo∣ber; and eleven in November. In December it seems to have almost entirely ceased, for not one was admitted during that month. Ninety-seven patients, affected with this fever, were therefore admitted into the dispensary in the space of eleven months.</P>
<P>The present epidemic was of the same nature as that which appeared at Carlisle in the year 1781, and of which I published an account. It, however, differed in some few particulars, which difference I shall briefly relate. 1. It did not rage so universally, the contagion, probably, not being so virulent. 2. The symptoms, in general, were more mild. 3. Petechiae and haemorrhages were seldom observed. 4. A greater proportion of children were affected. 5. Relapses were much more frequent. In the fever of 1781, I did not see one instance of a relapse; whereas in the present, it was a very common circum∣stance; several patients having even two relapses.</P>
<P>Of the ninety-seven patients labouring under this fever, and which were admitted into the dispensary, only four have died, who were all in extreme danger at the time of their admission, and two of them so much exhausted, as not to be able almost to take any medicine: viz. Margaret Storey, of Rickergate, a married woman, aged forty-two years, who died on the third day after admission; and Mary Wilson, of Nanson's lane, a child, aged three years, who died two days after admission. If we, therefore, omit these two, as cases already desperate, ninety-five will remain, of which only two died, which is exactly one in forty-seven and one half. A circumstance which strongly marks the efficacy of the practice, and more especially when it is considered, that almost the whole of these patients were confined, during their illness, in small, close, dirty rooms, where, in some cases, six persons were ill at the same time; and some∣times even three of them in one bed.</P>
<P>In the whole city nine persons died of this fever.</P>
<P>Before I conclude this part of my subject, I cannot omit observing that the dispensary has expended upwards of thirty pounds for wine, all of which was consumed by persons affected with this disouse.</P>
<P>Early in the month of December, 1784, the small pox were introduced by some vagrants, into the Damside, Irish Gates, to the neighbourhood of which they were confined some time, but afterwards be∣came general, and continued till the latter end of July, or beginning of August, when they entirely ceased. Eight patients affected with the natural small pox were admitted into the dispensary in the month of January; eight in February; two in March; twenty-one in April; nine in May; and four in July; in all fifty-two; twelve of whom died. Total of deaths of this disease, thirty-nine, who were all under five years of age.</P>
<P>As one in four and one third died of all those who were admitted into the dispensary, it is highly pro∣bable that of the whole number who laboured under the natural small pox, many of whom had not the least advice or assistance, one in four would die, which makes the number affected, one hundred and fifty-six. As soon as the disease made its appearance within the walls of the city, the monthly committee of the dispensary resolved, that a general inoculation of the poor inhabitants, agreeable to the plan which
<PB N="91" REF="102"/>I had proposed in the year 1783,
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The small pox, both natural and from inoculation, being now pretty general in Carlisle, and likely to spread still further, the monthly committee of the Carlisle Dispensary are of opinion, that a general inoculation of the poor and in∣digent inhabitants will be attended with very beneficial effects.</P>
<P N="1">R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>SOLVED 1st, That all such persons as come recommended by a subscriber, shall be inoculated gratis at the dispen∣sary.</P>
<P N="2">2d, That the sum of 2s. 6d. be given to the parents who are most indigent, and who have three or more children inoculated, as a reward for nursing them properly during inoculation.</P>
<P N="3">3d, That a subscriber of one guinea shall have the privilege of recommending three persons to be inoculated, with the reward; or five who do not require it; and so in proportion for any larger sum.</P>
<P N="4">4th, That the privilege of being inoculated at the dispensary be continued for the space of two months, and no longer.</P></NOTE> should take place at the dispensary, and it was with great pleasure I observed the prejudices of the vulgar against that most salutary invention, were greatly diminished. For as soon as the resolution of the committee was made public by the common crier, great numbers from all quarters of the town flocked to the dispensary, to reap the benefits which it held out to them. No less than ninety one were inoculated at the expence of the charity, and rather more than that number by the different practitioners. So that upon a moderate calculation, the whole number inoculated this year, amounted to two hundred; every one of whom not only recovered, but had the disease in a very favour∣able manner. As we have stated it as probable, that one in four died of the natural small pox, it is there∣fore probable that fifty lives were saved by this general inoculation; and if all those affected in the natural way had been also inoculated, no less than eighty-nine lives would have been preserved.</P>
<P>During this year, 1 in 37 and 1-7th nearly, of all the inhabitants have died—See Table VII.</P>
<P>Apoplexies and paralytic strokes were very frequent: no less than eight suffered from the apoplexy.</P>
<P>As usual the number of deaths of husbands continues to exceed that of wives; twenty-nine husbands have died, and only twenty-five wives.—See Table VI.</P>
<P>Nine widowers, and twenty-one widows have died this year.—See Table VI.</P>
<P>Persons between the ages of ten and fifteen, and fifteen and twenty years, have been astonishingly healthy, When I made the survey of Carlisle in the beginning of the year 1780, there were between ten and fifteen, seven hundred and fifteen; and between fifteen and twenty years of age, six hundred and seventy-five per∣sons: in all, one thousand three hundred and ninety. Since that period the inhabitants have unquestion∣ably increased much: it is therefore very probable, that at present there are not less than one thousand four hundred and fifty persons between the age of ten and twenty years, and yet of this number only two have died.—See Table V.</P>
<P>The present year, however, seems to have been fatal to old people, between eighty and ninety years of age, eight males and six females, five of whom were widows; and between ninety and an hundred, two males and four females have died.—See Table VI.</P>
<P>The number of males born greatly exceed the number of females; for, 148 males, and 119 females have been christened.—See Table VIII.</P>
<P>FOR THE YEAR 1786.] Although we had not nearly so much frost this year as the last, yet in other respects, the weather, during the present spring and summer, greatly resembled that of the year 1785. The winds, which were dry and cold, came chiefly from the east during the whole of the months of March, April, and a part of May, which made the spring late: and although the drought which succeeded was not of equal duration, yet it was much more intense, and consequently the fields exhibited the same parched and arid appearance they had done the last summer. Refreshing rains fell towards the middle of July: the autumn was fine; and a more mild and open winter was seldom or ever remembered.</P>
<P>There was scarcely any difference in the salubrity of the two years, two hundred and four persons dying the last, and two hundred and five in the present year. June, July, and August, which were the hottest months, were by far the most healthy, for only twenty-four persons died during that period.—See Table IV.</P>
<P>On the contrary, October, November, and December, were the most unhealthy, during which eighty-three deaths occurred: See Table IV.—This difference, however, did not seem to proceed from any alteration of the atmosphere, but from the measles, which were introduced into the town some time in August, and raged, during these three months, with the greatest violence.</P>
<P>About two o'clock on Friday morning, August 11th, a slight shock of an earthquake was very sensibly felt by many persons in Carlisle and the neighbourhood. Those who were perfectly awake, or who hap∣pened to be out of doors, report that the concussion continued about four or five seconds; and that it was immediately preceded by a hollow tremulous sound. Many were awakened out of their sleep, by the
<PB N="92" REF="103"/>shaking of their houses, beds, doors, and window shutters. Birds in cages were likewise sensible of its influence, and fluttered as if greatly agitated and alarmed. Very providentially, however, little or no damage was sustained; a few chimneys and old walls were here and there thrown down, and three people in Whitehaven were thrown off their feet. But in other respects, a momentary fright and alarm were the only inconveniences which were suffered from it. The concussion seemed to take its direction from the east to the west, and extended quite across the island, being felt both at Neweastle and Whitehaven. And from the north towards the south, it extended from Glasgow to the northern parts of Lancashire. The atmosphere on Wednesday and Thursday preceding, was moist, gloomy, and sultry; and so much so, on Thursday night, that a lady, who was on a visit at Dalston, actually foretold when she went to bed, that an earthquake would take place before morning. Friday was a very clear, hot, calm, sultry, day.</P>
<P>Early in the spring, the measles made their appearance in the south-west parts of Northumberland, where, I am informed, they proved very fatal. From thence they gradually advanced farther south, and the infection began to operate in Carlisle about the beginning of August: and as this epidemic had not visited us since the year 1780, there must consequently have been a great number of children who were liable to be affected by the contagious matter generated by this disorder. Hence the infection spread rapidly, and the disease soon became general, and continued to rage till the latter end of December, or beginning of January, 1787, when it altogether disappeared.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding, however, the disorder was so very general, yet its symptoms were extremely mild and favourable: for, of the great number who were affected, I should suppose not less than six or seven hun∣dred, only twenty-eight died, and the greater part of these were the children of the very poorest and lowest class of inhabitants, who were either too ignorant, or too obstinate to call in medical assistance. Of the twenty-eight who died, twenty-six were under five years of age, and two were between five and ten years old.</P>
<P>Another epidemic, viz. the chincough, occurred pretty early in the year, but this disease made little progress, until October, and even then did not become very general. Only nine children, who were all under five years of age, died of it, and some of those were affected with the chincough and measles at the same time, and therefore probably suffered from the joint effects of both.</P>
<P>During the present year, 1 in 37 and 5-6ths nearly, of all the inhabitants died in consequence of diseases.—See Table VII.</P>
<P>The number of deaths of husbands still continues to exceed that of wives; twenty-four husbands have died, and only twenty-one wives.—See Table VI.</P>
<P>Between eighty and ninety years of age, one male and five females, who were all widows; and between ninety and an hundred, two widows have died.</P>
<P>A man who had long been a soldier, and who must consequently have been subject to many varieties and vicissitudes of life, died at the advanced age of 105.</P>
<P>FOR THE YEAR 1787.] In the beginning of January, 1780, the inhabitants of the two parishes of St. Mary's and St. Cuthbert's, Carlisle, were very accurately numbered by Mr. Stanger, Mr. Howard, and myself. At that period these parishes contained 3491 males, and 4186 females, in all 7677.</P>
<P>Sometime in the year 1787, an order was issued from the court of Quarter Sessions, to the different constables in the county of Cumberland, to make an actual survey of all the inhabitants of the county. The survey was accordingly made at Carlisle in the latter end of December; but, as the motives which induced the magistrates to issue this order were not generally known, many gentlemen refused to give an account of their families. The abbey, as being extraparochial, and the township of Wreay, through some mistake, were altogether omitted in this survey: hence it is evident, the lists delivered in to the Quarter Sessions are very erroneous.</P>
<P>I, however, had an opportunity of examining all the returns of the above parishes very minutely, and as the constables marked down the names of all those persons who refused to give them information, I was enabled to make up the deficiency, by procuring the numbers in each of their families, and I am persuaded the enumeration is now pretty exact; but if there be any error, it will be on the side of defici∣ency, rather than of excess.</P>
<P>From this survey, thus corrected, it appears that the two parishes of St. Mary's and St. Cutbbert's▪ contain at present 3864 males, 4813 females, and consequently 8677 inhabitants.—For a more particular account see Table III.</P>
<P>There has therefore been an increase, in the space of eight years, of a thousand inhabitants; which is a circumstance, that must give great pleasure to all those who are well-wishers to the prosperity of the city of Carlisle.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="104"/>From what causes, it may be asked, has this rapid increase arisen? It affords me considerable satis∣faction to be able to inform the public, that it has principally been owing to two general causes, viz. <HI>The salubrity of the place, and the increase of trade and manufactures.</HI> The former is clearly proved by the great excess of births above deaths; for, during the last eight years, the period in question, 2071 children have been baptized, and only 1582 persons have been buried. The births, therefore, exceed the deaths 489. The latter, viz. <HI>the increase of trade and manufactures,</HI> is proved by an ingress of inhabitants into Carlisle, exceeding the emigration out of it, during the same period, 511; which numbers together make up the increase of 1000.</P>
<P>Inoculation, I am persuaded, has also greatly contributed to the increase of population, not only in Carlisle, but likewise in the whole county of Cumberland. In the year 1779, when the lower class of inhabitants were extremely averse to this salutary discovery, no fewer than ninety persons died of the na∣tural small pox; whereas only 151 have died during the eight succeeding years; which is, upon an ave∣rage, not quite nineteen in each year; and yet that disorder prevailed in every one of these years. (See all the bills of mortality which have been published.) Since that period, viz. 1779, the prejudices of the vulgar against inoculation, have greatly diminished, and will soon, I doubt not, be totally eradicated. And since the institution of the dispensary, the poor have enjoyed the privilege of having their children inoculated gratis; an advantage which they have, in general, with great readiness embraced.</P>
<P>The first four months of the present year, greatly resembled the beginning of the year 1779. The weather in both was remarkably mild and temperate, for there was scarce any frost in either. The com∣mon daisy was in full flower on new-year's-day, and continued in blossom almost the whole year: the Primrose began to blow on the 1st of February: and the Colt's-foot and Barren Strawberry very early in the same month: in short, all the early flowering plants were in full blow five or six weeks before their usual time. The state of the weather, however, throughout the year, was the reverse of 1785 and 1786; these years were remarkably hot and dry; this was cold, gloomy, and uncommonly wet, insomuch that there never was a year in which, probably, more rain fell than in the present.</P>
<P>The late Dr. Carlyle kept an accurate account of the quantity of rain which fell at Carlisle during a period of twenty years, viz. from the year 1757 to 1776 inclusive, which his son, the Rev. Mr. Chancellor Carlyle, has been kind enough to communicate to me. During this period, the greatest quantity which fell in any one year, was thirty-one inches and a few lines; and the medium depth of these years was only twenty four inches, eight lines and a half. Unfortunately, since 1776, no regular measure has been taken at Carlisle; but Dr. Campbell, a very ingenious physician at Lancaster, has sent me a table of the quantity which fell at that place during the present year; and from which it appears, that it amounted to the almost incredible quantity of fifty-one inches and one line. The rain, therefore, which fell this year, is considerably above double the quantity which has fallen in any one year, on an average of twenty year's calculation, and exceeds, in quantity, twenty inches what fell in the wetest of the above years. It must, however, be observed, that Lancaster is situated somewhat nearer the western ocean than Carlisle; and that the hills to the east and north-east of that place, are nearer it than the hills about Carlisle, which, in all probability, will make some difference in the quantity of rain which falls at each place.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the very great moisture of the atmosphere, above related, yet the present year was a healthy one, and the last six months were remarkably so; seventy-three persons only died during that period.—See Table IV.</P>
<P>The small pox made their appearance in January, and were in Carlisle the greatest part of the year; but inoculation soon became general, which prevented the disorder from raging with any great degree of violence Thirty only died, twenty-eight of whom were under five years of age, and two between five and ten years. Eighty-four were inoculated at the dispensary, all of whom not only survived, but had the disorder very favourably; and considerable numbers were likewise inoculated by several surgeons in the town.</P>
<P>The putrid or jail fever also prevailed almost the whole year; but as it neither became general, nor malignant, till the beginning of 1788, I shall at present only observe, that fourteen persons fell victims to it.</P>
<P>The difference in the number of deaths of husbands and wives is this year very considerable; for thirty-four husbands have died, and only twenty two wives.—See Table VI.</P>
<P>Between eighty and ninety years of age, five males and five females, (the latter were widows;) and between ninety and one hundred, one male and two females have died.—See Table VI.</P>
<P>During the present year, only 1 in 44 nearly, of all the inhabitants have died in consequence of diseases;
<PB N="94" REF="105"/>and upon an average of the last nine years 1 in 39 and 1-4th has died.—See Table VII. It must be re∣marked in the first place, that every infectious and epidemic disease, to which the human body is subject, (the plague excepted) prevailed during this period at Carlisle; and in the second place, that the calcula∣tions were made for the first eight years: from the number of inhabitants which existed in the beginning of the year 1780, the great increase (of one thousand) not being ascertained till the present year 1787. Therefore, although the deaths from accidents were not taken into the account for several of the first years; yet, upon the whole, the mortality is stated to be greater than it actually is.—See Table VII.</P>
<P>The deaths which occurred from accidents, were, in 1779, four; in 1780, three; in 1781, five; in 1782, four; in 1783, three; in 1784, five; in 1785, four; in 1786, two; and in 1787, two.</P>
<P>From table VII. it appears that the most healthy period of human life is from ten to fifteen years of age, and that health declines in the following order, viz. between 20 and 30,—15 and 20,— 5 and 10,—30 and 40,—40 and 50,—50 and 60,—60 and 70,—under 5,—70 and 80,—80 and 90,—90 and 100. —See Table VII.</P>
<P>Table VIII. gives a connected view of all the christenings and burials from 1779 to 1796, inclusive.</P>
<P>Dr. Heysham's tables of deaths and diseases of persons of different ages are omitted, as wholly apper∣taining to medical subjects.</P>
<P>I shall conclude the observations on the bills of mortality, with an account of a very curious and important circumstance in physiology, which occurred at Carlisle during the present year. A child was born, apparent∣ly at the full time, not only alive, but which lived and took nourishment several days, without the smallest vestige of a brain. In all my reading I do not recollect to have met with so extraordinary a phenomenon; nor does it appear that Professor Monro, who has spent the greatest part of his time in anatomical and physiological pursuits, has either seen or read of any thing exactly similar. He has indeed, in his inge∣nious observations on the structure and functions of the nervous system, published in 1783, favoured the world with some plates, which represent the heads of two children, born at the full time, in which the bones which generally form the top of the cranium are wanting, and in which the brain, which is ex∣tremely small, projects like an excrescence. In these two instances, however, there was a small portion of brain in each, and though both the children are stated to have been born at the full time, yet it does not appear that they were even born alive, much less that they lived any time after birth; for, if either had been the case, we cannot suppose that a gentleman of Dr. Monro's great accuracy, would have omitted circumstances so remarkable; but I think we may, on the contrary, infer from his silence, and from the following conclusions, which he himself draws from the above-mentioned monstrous productions, and which I shall take the liberty of quoting, as the work is not in every person's hands, that they were really born dead:—</P>
<P><Q>Nay we may, perhaps, go a step farther, and doubt whether, instead of considering the brain as the origin of the nerves, we ought not to consider it merely as connected with the nerves: or whether there are better reasons for supposing the brain to produce the nerves, than for supposing the nerves to pro∣duce the brain. Some facts, at least, may be here observed, which seem to shew that the nerves may exist, independent of the brain.</Q></P>
<P N="1"><Q>I. In children delivered at the full time, plump and well formed in their trunk and limbs, I have observed the substance which supplied the place of the brain, not more bulky than a small nut; and, instead of containing a white medullary substance, it was of a red colour, resembling a clot of blood: and small cords, occupying the place of the optic nerves, were likewise of a red colour. Yet the spinal marrow, and all the nerves from it, had the ordinary size and appearance.</Q></P>
<P N="2"><Q>II In a monstrous kitten, with two bodies and the appearance of one head, I found the spinal mar∣row of one of the bodies connected with a brain and cerebellum of the common shape and size. But the spinal marrow of the other body, though equally large, had only a small button of medullary substance at its upper end, without a suitable brain or cerebellum.</Q>

<HEAD>An account of a Female Child which was born at Carlisle, at the full Time, alive, and which lived five Days and twenty-one Hours, without the smallest appearance of a Brain.</HEAD>
<P>At eight o'clock on Monday morning, May 26, 1788, Mary Clarke, aged 26 years, and the mother of six children, some of whom are healthy and others unhealthy, was delivered of a living female child, at the expence of the Carlisle dispensary.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="106"/>The midwife, shocked at the strange and unusual appearance of the child's head, sent for me immedi∣ately. I got there about an hour after the delivery, and at first sight, it appeared evident that the bones which form the upper part of the scull were wanting, and that the brain was only covered by its proper membranes, the <HI>pia</HI> and <HI>dura mater,</HI> and resembled a large excrescence which projected a little over the common integuments, especially towards the forehead, where it extended over the root of the nose. The colour of this substance was a dark reddish brown, and upon examining it more particularly, I thought I could perceive the division of the two hemispheres of the brain, and likewise the division of the cerebrum from the cerebellum. I gently raised with my fingers, a part of it which projected over the integuments, which made the child cry, and produced a considerable starting, similar to what is occasioned by an electric shock. The child was full grown, and seemed in perfect health, her limbs were plump, firm, and well proportioned, and she moved them with apparent agility. The external organs of sense were also perfect. She swallowed well, and took a sufficient quantity of nourishment for several days, but sometimes during the action of swallowing started a little. She lived till five o'clock on Sunday morning, June the 1st, when she expired Some time before her death she was affected with flight convulsions. During the three or four days preceding her death, there was a constant discharge of a thin watery fluid, somewhat tinged with blood, from the excrescence, which greatly diminished its bulk; for at her death, it was only about half the size of what it had been when she was born, and the surface was, in some places, beginning to put on an appearance of mortification.</P>
<P>A few hours after her death, Dr. Blamire, and Mr. Charles Farish, accompanied me to the house, where Dr. Blamire very cautiously dissected, away from the bones, the whole of the substance; when we found the greatest part of the frontal, the temporal, the occipital, and the whole of the parietal bones wanting. The substance removed was then carefully examined, and what was our astonishment to find it entirely to consist of membranes, blood-vessels, but principally of several bags; one of which was as large as a nut-meg, the rest of different sizes, but much smaller. They were all filled with a brownish coloured fluid; which, when the cysts were punctured, gushed out with some violence.</P>
<P>There was not the least appearance of cerebrum, cerebellum, or any medullary substance whatever. The spinal marrow had a natural appearance, but did not seem to have been connected with the parts above described.</P>
<P>Having accurately related the facts as they appeared to Dr. Blamire and myself, which for their singularity deserve to be recorded; I think the few following obvious inferences may be drawn from them 1. That the fluid discharged from the excrescence during the life of the infant, and which produced the great dimi∣nution of its bulk, was occasioned by the rupture, or erosion of cysts, similar to those which remained sound and full of water after death. 2d, That the living principle, the nerves of the trunk, and extremities, sensation and motion, may exist independent of, and that the natural, vital, and animal functions, may be performed without the brain. And as the external organs of sense, viz. the eyes, the nose, the tongue, and the ears, all seemed perfect; may we not, therefore, suppose, that the optic, the olfactory, the gusta∣tory, and the auditory nerves, may exist independent of, and unconnected with either the brain or spinal marrow?</P>
<P>I content myself with little more than describing this extraordinary case, and leave to others to deduce from it, such conclusions as the appearances observed may be thought to warrant.</P>
<P>FOR THE YEAR 1796.] In the month of April, this year, a survey, under the direction of the editors, was made by Mr. Johnston, a person of accuracy and attention, who found that the two parishes of St. Mary and St. Cuthbert contained 1587 houses, 2616 families, and 10,289 inhabitants. It therefore appears that the increase since 1780 has been 2612; and since 1787, 1612.—For a more particular ac∣count of the different surveys which have been made, see Tables I. and III.</P>
<P>Middlescugh and Brathwaite, two small townships within the parish of St. Mary, but nine miles distant from Carlisle, are not included in any of the surveys, as the inhabitants of these townships, never christen their children, or bury their dead at the parish church.</P>

<HEAD>The State of Agriculture in the two Parishes of St. Mary and St. Cuthbert.</HEAD>
<P>EXTBNT.] North and south about five miles and a half; east and west about three miles.</P>
<P>SOIL AND PRODUCE.] The soil is very different in quality and fertility: a sandy or gravelly loam prevails in the vicinage of Carlisle and Carleton: a loam, in which clay predominates, is found in most other parts of these parishes, particularly about Botchardby Harraby, Uprightby, Blackhall, and most parts of the chapel of Wreay. About Cumersdale, a greyish soil covers a stratum of clay. Towards the southern and western extremities, are considerable tracts of moorish soils, which, not many years ago, were very barren commons; but which, by inclosure and proper management, are now generally in a pro∣gressive state of improvement.</P>
<P>Land near Carlisle is chiefly applied to the purposes of dairying, breeding and feeding sheep, growing hay for horses, &amp;c. Wheat is the principal grain cultivated upon the best strong soils; a fallow gene∣rally precedes. On soils having a considerable portion of land, turnips, barley, and clover, or other artificial grasses, are beginning to be much sown, which is found to be a very profitable system. Pota∣toes form a considerable article of cultivation in these parishes. On the late inclosed commons, oats is the most prevailing crop: that grain also has its turn in the course of husbandry in more fertile districts, as have pease and beans. I am sorry to add, that the barbarous and unprofitable system of taking two or more white crops in succession, though yearly losing ground, has yet its advocates here The great quantity of manure made at Carlisle, fertilizes the soil in the neighbourhood; and the crops are generally abundant. Grass ground increase, while that in tillage diminishes.</P>
<P>RENT.] Within half a mile of Carlisle, is from 3l. to 5l. 10s. per acre. In old inclosures, and pretty good soils at a greater distance, from 1l. to about 2l. 10s. There are, however, some farms, where the soil is unfertile, that do not fetch above 10s. per acre.</P>
<P>So great is the improvement of land in these parishes that, I was told, ground which did not bring more than 8s. per acre, forty years ago, is now let from 2l. to 3l. 10s. per acre. It was at that period in common field.</P>
<P>SHEEP AND CATTLE.] About five hundred or six hundred sheep may be kept here, which are mostly of the short legged, long wooled breed. The standing stocks are improving in fineness of bone and wool, and inclination to feed, by tups of the improved breed from the stocks of Mr. Culley, and other eminent sheep-breeders in Northumberland.</P>
<P>Mr. Porter of Carlisle ranks among the first who introduced that profitable breed into Cumberland, and is now in possession of a valuable stock, which depasture upon the Swifts. Cattle are generally of the best Cumberland breeds; but the cow keepers about Carlisle seem to prefer the short horned, or Dutch sort; some of which, when properly fed, afford a very great quantity of milk. There are instances of some giving forty quarts per day (wine measure) for a few weeks after calving; thirty quarts is not very uncommon, and twenty-four frequent. She is, however, esteemed a good cow, that affords from sixteen to twenty quarts of milk per day for great part of the summer. These cows are fed with the most luxu∣riant grass in summer, hay in winter, and generally grains or potatoes every day in the year. The expence
<PB N="97" REF="108"/>of feeding is heavy: but the most experienced cow keepers have found that the great secret of profit∣ing by cows, is to select the best milkers, either of the Dutch, Lancashire, or Galloway breeds, and to feed them with sufficient quantities of the best food. That however, it must be acknowledged, is a practice not much followed in most other parts of this county.</P>
<P>RIVERS AND FISH.] The Eden, Caldew, and Petterel, water these parishes. These rivers abound with trout, eel, and other sorts of small fish, common in the country. In the Eden large quantities of salmon are caught. The waters of Caldew and Petterel, and particularly the former, are remarkable for the quality of bleaching white. It is rather an unpleasant reflection, that these rapid streams, so peculiarly adapted to the purpose of turning machinery for miles above Carlisle, more particularly the Caldew: and by a proper application of which, that city might be rendered almost the Birmingham of the north, should only be employed in giving motion to three or four solitary corn mills, and a few cotton works.</P>
<P>THE KING-GARTH FISHERY.] A little below Cargo, is the King-Garth fishery, which the corpora∣tion of Carlisle, held under the charter of Edward III. and having given rise to a subject of some notoriety in this part of the county, a few years ago, it may not be amiss here to give a short account of it.</P>
<P>An eye draught of the <HI>Stell Fisheries</HI> at King-garth.</P>

<P>B. Where the stells crossed the river.</P>
<P>C. The ancient main course of the river, where the stells were formerly placed, now dried up, called King-Garth.</P>
<P>D. King-Garth fishhouse.</P>
<P>E. Carbed.</P>
<P>F. Cargo-Holm.</P>
<P>This fishery of the corporation (being a <HI>several fishery</HI>) extended only across the stream, between Cargo-holm and Carbed, and so hath been lost, by the river altering its course many years ago. The fishery in that part of the river where the stell was lately placed, belonged to Lord Lonsdale; and was, till lately, under lease to the corporation. The device for catching fish, called a <HI>Stell,</HI> used by the lessees of the corporation, was a net across the water, tied to stakes drove in for that purpose, which caught or stopped most of the salmon; it being only in high floods that any could get past it: by those means the other fisheries higher up the river, were become of trifling value.</P>
<P>For remedy whereof, an action was commenced, in the year 1783, by the owners of those other fisheries, against the lessees of the corporation upon the statute 2d. Hen. VI. chap. 15th. (which statute expressly prohibits the standing of nets fastened to posts, continually day and night, overthwart the river Thames, and other rivers of the realm: under the penalty of 100 shillings for every offence).—This action came to a hearing at the assizes at Carlisle, the same year, before judge Buller; when a verdict was given for the plaintiff: and which, on a new trial the year following, was confirmed. Since which, that fishery hath been occupied by Lord Lonsdale's agents, in the usual way of nets drawn by hands.</P>
<P>It may be observed, that, this matter was about being brought to a legal decision, about fifty years ago, when the double passage in the river occasioned the difficulty of obtaining redress, in regard the nets not being entirely <HI>overthwart</HI> the same, within the description and meaning of the act.</P>
<P>The corporation are also entitled to a <HI>free fishery</HI> (generally called a <HI>boat fishery</HI>) in this river, which was granted by the charter of Edward IV.</P>
<P>There are from this part of the river up to Carlisle, about seventeen other boat fishings, belonging to at least, as many different proprietors; the annual value of which are various, between 6l. and 40l. each, and upwards.</P>
<P>ROADS.] Are tolerably good. Two old fashioned narrow stone bridges, over two branches of the Eden connect Carlisle with Stanwix. Caldewgate is also connected with Carlisle by two stone bridges over as many branches of the Caldew. Two roads, the one from the south and the other from the east, cross the Petterel; and at each place there is a stone bridge. The road from London to Edinburgh, and that from Whitehaven to Newcastle, intersect these parishes in different directions.</P>
<P>FUEL.] Is chiefly coal from Tindale-fell.</P>
<NOTE PLACE="foot"><HI>* Since the last page was printed off, we were credibly informed the number of sheep kept in these two parishes, is about</HI> 1600.</NOTE>
<P><PB N="98" REF="109"/>GAME.] Are hares and partridges.</P>
<P>QUARRIES AND BUILDINGS.] In these parishes are excellent freestone quarries in different places. Those of most note are on the Petterel near Newbiggin, and those near Durdare and Burnthwaite.—No limestone. Near Quarrygate is a vein or quarry of alabaster, or gypsum. Buildings are generally pretty good, and covered with blue or red state: a few houses are yet thatched, and some are even built with clay walls.</P>
<P>TITHES.] A considerable part of these parishes pay tithes in kind; and a portion pay a modus in lieu thereof.</P>
<P>SCHOOL.] At Blackhall, a donation amounting annually to 5l. 8s. was left by the late Thomas Lowry, Esq. of Blackhall, for the education of seven poor children.</P>
<P>WOODS AND PLANTATIONS.] The banks of Caldew are cloathed with wood, principally oak; some small plots of woodland appear in other parts, and a few trees grow on hedge-rows. Several hundred acres of the most barren parts of the common, when they were inclosed, were planted with forest trees, and chiefly Scotch fir: they have succeeded beyond the expectation of every one, and now not only beautify the country, and shelter the farms in the neighbourhood, but will ultimately prove very profitable to the proprietors. Rearing of wood is the most profitable way of applying most barren soils.</P>
<P>ASPECT AND GENERAL APPEARANCE.] Though this district contains many irregular, but gentle swells; it is as level, and perhaps more so, than most parts of the county: the general inclination is to∣wards the north, but small.</P>
<P>The extensive vales, formed by the Eden, the Caldew and Petterel, are level, fertile, and beautiful; they incircle Carlisle, which rises on a gentle eminence in the centre, and commands a pleasant prospect of the adjacent country. Among other delightful views which appear from that city, the neat house, gardens, &amp;c. of William Richardson, Esq. at Rickerby, are seen beyond the verdant fields through which the Eden winds its way, and forms an excellent object.</P>
<P>Mr. Losh of Woodside is making every thing smile round him: his house, his garden, his farms, are almost daily under his improving hands: land too barren for tillage he plants with wood. Between Woodside and Durdare is a tract of very poor ground, divided, but not inclosed, nor cultivated: Mr. Losh has lately purchased a small part thereof for 2l. 10s. per acre, inclosed and planted it with forest trees: the other proprietors, it appears, have not yet discovered how much it would be to their advantage, either to dispose of their shares to Mr. Losh; or follow his example in turning them to profit.</P>
<P>COUNTY GAOL AT CARLISLE.] Is old, much out of repair, and without the regular means of sup∣plying the different rooms with fresh air, so necessary in these wretched receptacles of guilt and misfor∣tune. The celebrated Mr. Howard describes it as follows:—</P>
<P><Q>The court spacious, 85 yards by 36: it was common to all prisoners; but now a part is appropri∣ated to the felons, and separated by iron palisades. In the court is a chapel, built as appears by the date, in 1734. Five rooms for master side debtors: and as many on the common side. Most of the latter are large, but have windows to the street. Where there are so many rooms, not to separate the men and women is certainly inexcusable.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The wards for felons are two rooms, down a step or two; dark and dirty. One of them, the day room, had a window to the street; through which spirituous liquors, and tools for mischief, might be easily conveyed: but it is now bricked up: the night room is only 11 feet by 9. At my last visit, <HI>men</HI> and <HI>women</HI> were lodged together in it.
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The men and women felons are now confined in separate apartments.</NOTE> Two rooms over the felons' wards, which have been used as tap rooms, seem to be intended for the <HI>women</HI> only,
<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">They are now appropriated to that purpose.</NOTE> but in <HI>one</HI> of these I also found <HI>three men,</HI> and four <HI>women,</HI> lodged together. No infirmary. Transports had not the allowance of two shillings and sixpence a week. Clauses against spirituous liquors, and act for preserving the health of prisoners, not hung up. Gaol delivery <HI>once</HI> a year. Few gaols have so many convenient rooms for common side debtors. It is the more remarkable here, because there is <HI>no table</HI> signed by the magis∣trates, to particularize the free wards. Some gaolers avail themselves of such a circumstance, and demand rent for rooms which were undoubtedly designed for common side prisoners.</Q></P>
<P>The furniture is provided by the prisoners, and is generally wretched in the extreme. Mr. Mullinder, the present gaoler, seems, however, to keep the different apartments as clean and comfortable as circum∣stances will admit. The rooms and passages are whitewashed once a year; and the felons' rooms (wholly composed of stone) cleaned of all noxious matter, by burning a large quantity of straw upon the floor, so that disorders rarely prevail there. We would, however, recommend a more frequent use of lime as a wash: being convinced, that, nothing is more conducive to the prevention, or eradication of infections.—The prisoners have an opportunity of purchasing milk and vegetables, every day, in
<PB N="99" REF="110"/>great plenty. No ale nor spirits are now sold in the gaol: and it is much to be wished that intoxica∣ting liquors were very sparingly allowed to be brought therein.</P>
<P>The magistrates for the county have had it in contemplation, these several years, to build a new goal, in the castle-green: and have prepared a large quantity of stones for the purpose: a situation we can∣not too much recommend: but from what reason the design is not forwarded, we are not informed.</P>
<P>IMPORTATIONS AND EXPORTATIONS AT CARLISLE PORT.] Extracted from the custom house books.—The importations principally consist of deals, tar, staves, rum, &amp;c. &amp;c. and the exporta∣tions of grain, potatoes, oak bark, oat meal, flour, timber, lead, freestone, herrings, alabaster, British barrel staves, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
