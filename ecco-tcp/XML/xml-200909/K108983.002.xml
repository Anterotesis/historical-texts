<ARGUMENT>
<P>WHICH WILL SHEW THAT THE SNAKE WAS SCOTCHED—NOT
KILLED.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>As I intimated at the end of the first volume, that the pranks
of the mad musician, extraneous as at first sight they must appear, had
relation, and very strongly too, to the main and most material part of my
design, so I shall now proceed to shew in what way.</P>
<P>The reader will allow me that, according to the letter of my
description, which really did not outgo the fact, the bustle at the inn
must, to strangers, and particularly ladies, have been alarming to a 
<PB N="6" REF="4"/> great degree; and when it is considered that Lady Hazard
was seven months gone with child, it will not appear very extraordinary that,
terrified in so unexpected and particular a manner, it should have such
an effect upon her tender and delicate frame, as to throw her into labour,
which it actually did.</P>
<P>Mr. Standfast, upon this news, undertook to produce a
gentleman of the faculty from London, whither he went as fast as a chaise
and four horses could convey him, accompanied by Charles, whose anxiety for
his mother was strongly manifested in his heartening and encouraging the
postillions. My Lord however was not idle. There were several towns near at
hand, and each of them boasted its man-midwife; so fashionable was it
even then, to adopt a custom which the landlord swore—as he stirred
the kitchen fire to prepare for the neces∣sary potations upon this
occasion—was a disgrace to the English nation; a custom to which
our ances∣tors, who had nerves that, like their bows, twanged with
strength, were utter strangers. He said it was a custom originating
from sloth and effiminacy; that it was one of those blessed
improvements to∣wards the annihilation of manliness and becoming decency that
our natural enemies did us the favour to introduce every day; that it was
unmanly and <PB N="7" REF="5"/> scandalous as well as ignorant and ridiculous,
for that the most experienced practitioner could not possibly, from the
nature of the circumstance, ar∣rive to any thing comparable to the knowledge
of a woman upon such an occasion, to whom every possible symptom
must be practically known, and who—which with our landlord was
nine-tenths of his argument—could alone conduct such a particu∣lar
business with proper decorum.</P>
<P>In this temper he sent for a good old lady, who, he said,
had been obstetric gentlewoman usher to half the town, and never had met
with an accident, unless from such a combination of natural causes as
would have baffled the utmost perfection of art.</P>
<P>The old lady, who resided in the neighbourhood, arrived
first, and Lord Hazard, extremely anxious to procure assistance, made
no scruple of introducing her to his wife.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Ay, ay,' cried the landlord, as he poured her
out a glass of usquebaugh, 'this is as it should be; here, my lord, is an
operator, and please you, worth a thousand of your men-midwives; fellows
that I believe would rather have the reputation of getting children than of
bringing them into the world. I once asked a chap of this stamp what 
<PB N="8" REF="6"/> made all the children he produced so cursed
rickety?—and he answered me, with great arch∣ness, that a man had a
right to mar what he made.'</Q></P>
<P>Notwithstanding the landlord's rhetoric, he was obliged to
pull in his horns when he understood that Lady Hazard's case was of so
particular a kind that the good old gentlewoman, his friend, could not venture
to proceed in it upon her single judg∣ment. Being asked what he said to
this, he replied he was still right:—it happened to be one of those
difficult cases which required assistance; but yet the gentleman,
whoever he was, would reap great be∣nefit from the old woman, who would be able
to explain to him all he had to do, and from a convic∣tion, being a woman, that
he could not have the smallest conception of.</P>
<P>Before morning, arrived three gentlemen, who had been sent for
from different towns, and presently afterwards Standfast, Charles, and an
eminent man-midwife from London, who, upon all such occasions, attended her
ladyship. A number of corks were heard to report their liberty, and hot wine,
possets, and other comfortable drinks smoked all over the house; yet,
though the landlord was greatly pleased at what went forward, when he cast
his eyes upon the medical tribe, he could not help remarking that 
<PB N="9" REF="7"/> he did not believe there was half so much fuss when king
ARTHUR was born.</P>
<P>To the last gentleman who arrived, the rest of course gave
way. He immediately visited Lady Hazard, and shortly afterwards found it
necessary to have a private conversation with his lordship:—nor
will the reader be greatly astonished, though very much shocked, to hear
that, in the course of this conference, it came out that the peculiarity of
Lady Hazard's case originated with Miss Snaffle!</P>
<P>Lord Hazard's feeling on this occasion was not simply
wretchedness, it was horror. Standfast was called in, that the whole might
be explained to him; in doing which, my lord used such forcible lan∣guage,
so execrated himself, and so extolled the high, the transcendent
friendship of the tutor, that the surgeon, who was both a sensible man
and a valuable member of society, declared he was charm∣ed at the
circumstance, and should be very happy to cultivate Mr. Standfast's
friendship.</P>
<P>The surgeon being now particularly informed of the case,
declared that a very disagreeable operation must be performed; but he hoped
the life of Lady Hazard was not in danger. He said he could easily give the
matter a turn to the other physical gentle∣men, <PB N="10" REF="8"/> who, he
could plainly see, were ignorant pre∣tenders to a profession in which
they had neither right nor ability to practice; and this, he said, he
conceived materially necessary for the sake of Lady Hazard's peace of
mind, which it would be impos∣sible to preserve if the matter were known
to any but himself:—it being a practice with these gentry, at which
indeed they are very expert, to injure the domestic, as well as the
corporeal, constitution.</P>
<P>Lord Hazard, finding that every thing might be managed without
confiding to his lady the real cause of her present danger, declared he
would wait the event with patience and resignation, which turned out as the
surgeon had predicted, the child was destroyed, but the lady survived the
operation. As to the old woman, she was sent home as soon as
possible, for the surgeon agreed so far with the land∣lord, that he
feared much more a discovery through her, than through his brother
professors.</P>
<P>It was nearly six weeks before Lady Hazard could be with
safety removed; during which time, her kind friend Lady Roebuck scarcely
stirred from her. Nor was the baronet less attentive to my lord. He had
set his heart upon stimulating that nobleman to an emulation of his own
conduct, when they should arrive in Warwickshire, and doubted not, as 
<PB N="11" REF="9"/> he knew Lady Hazard longed for the accomplish∣ment of
so desirable an end, when he should ex∣plain to his friend how
practicable such a task was, and how sure and immense the reward, he
would readily join him in so meritorious an exercise of that liberality
which Lord Hazard, whatever were his foibles, certainly possessed.</P>
<P>Pleased with these ideas, the time rolled insen∣sibly
on; for as soon as Lady Hazard could be re∣moved, she was, for the
present, conveyed to a house in the neighbourhood, which her lord had hired
for that purpose; and as the company Sir Sidney ex∣pected for the summer
called, of necessity, at the John of Gaunt's Head, in a few days the poet,
painter, and musician made their appearance, as well as Sir Sidney's
attorney, and a clergyman, all of whom, by invitation, were to pass the
summer at Roebuck hall.</P>
<P>The assembly having now so largely increased, parties of
pleasure were planned; and as Lady Ha∣zard's health seemed every day to be
more confirm∣ed, the general tranquillity was restored.</P>
<P>As to my lord, his resolution was made, and cer∣tainly
irrevocably. Therefore, as no worse conse∣quences had happened from his
former conduct, he <PB N="12" REF="10"/> rejoiced at the present moment in the
same degree as a patient who, by a trifling and immaterial mu∣tilation, is
restored to health and vigour from the morbid effects of a gangrene.</P>
<P>The great difficulty with Sir Sidney and Lady Roebuck was how to
proceed as to Standfast. It was impossible to begin their attack on Lady
Ha∣zard, as it would ruffle her mind in her present weak condition; and as to
my lord, he was so wrapped up in his amiable friend, that it would be
impracticable, as well as highly absurd, to attempt at undeceiving him.</P>
<P>In this state were matters situated when the cler∣gyman
lately mentioned arrived at the inn. This gentleman, whose name was Friend,
had been known to Sir Sidney for many years, and was not the less esteemed
by him for having incurred the displeasure of a bishop, because he
would not vote against his conscience. He was a very learned, and, what is
a great deal better, a very sensible man; for though he had little of that
understanding by which men rise in the world, and which, according to
nine-tenths of mankind, is the only mental coin that ought to pass current,
yet he had a number of old fashioned virtues, of no great use but to the
owner; but to him valuable indeed:—such as piety, <PB N="13" REF="11"/>
an unsullied conscience, a benevolent heart, with the addition of a clear
judgment, an inventive ge∣nius, and a critical and accurate knowledge of
an∣cient and modern literature.</P>
<P>As Sir Sidney's was a kind of house of call to good characters
out of employ, no wonder this gen∣tleman was sometimes with him. His visit
at pre∣sent, however, was on another account; for the baronet, to tell the
reader the truth, was not with∣out hopes of seeing him rector of Little
Hockley. He had been some time nominated curate; and, at the death of the
present incumbent, the living would be in the gift of Lord Hazard. That this
circum∣stance, which has not been mentioned before, may not appear
extraordinary, I shall now explain how it came about.</P>
<P>When Sir Sidney wrote to Lord Hazard, as we have seen,
relative to Little Hockley, he little dreamt that his application would have
produced all the cordiality that now subsisted between them.—On the
contrary, there was more of delicacy than hopes of success in consulting
him at all.</P>
<P>To Mr. Standfast, however, he did not conceive he owed any
such delicacy; and therefore, as the right of nominating a curate reverted to
the rector, <PB N="14" REF="12"/> at the death of Major Malplaquet, disliking
the bargain and sale manner in which it had been trans∣acted before, he
applied, in the strongest possible way, to the good pastor, for the
appointment of Mr. Friend to that situation: namely, by making an offer to
commute with him for the entire pro∣fits of the living, at a very handsome
price, and to pay the curate's salary out of his own pocket.</P>
<P>The rector, who could calculate much better than he could
preach, entered into the whole spirit of the argument, and Mr. Friend became
to Sir Sid∣ney, what Mr. Standfast had been formerly to Ma∣jor Malplaquet.
This was the reason why Mr. Figgins removed to his vicarage, who, officiating
for some short time at Little Hockley, while the negociation was pending
between Sir Sidney and the rector, became known to the baronet and Mr. Friend,
both of whom believed him to be a very valuable young man, and Sir Sidney, in
particular, assured him that if he could in future be of any ser∣vice to
him, it would give him pleasure.</P>
<P>In a few days after the arrival of Mr. Friend, Standfast had
so ingratiated himself into his good opinion, that the worthy man was
charmed with him. Indeed Standfast saw plainly that this was a good medium
of recommendation to Sir Sidney, <PB N="15" REF="13"/> whose friendship, for
some reason or other, he was strenuously desirous to cultivate.
Perhaps, as pro∣vidence appeared to have rescued Lord Hazard from his
immediate gripe, he had some similar favour in contemplation for the
baronet.</P>
<P>Certain it is that the damning proof which Sir Sidney and his
lady imagined they had against Mr. Standfast, which was only presumptive,
began to sink before those positive proofs which seemed every day to
announce his reformation from a number of crimes which he made no scruple to
say he had formerly committed; and this, added to the transport he
ap∣parently felt at the restoration of that happiness which now began to
gild the moments of Lord and Lady Hazard, gave this fortunate gentleman such
a favourable place in the hearts of all about him, that really an accusation
to his prejudice, though ever so plausibly urged, would probably have
gained but little faith, unless backed by very weighty, and indeed undeniable
proof against him.</P>
<P>These Sir Sidney really had not. The utmost he could alledge
was that dissipation and those irre∣gularities which Standfast
confessed and disclaimed, except indeed a strong suspicion of his
being con∣cerned in all the business of Miss Snaffle, which, if this
recent behaviour was not hypocrisy, amounted <PB N="14" REF="14"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/><PB N="15" REF="15"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/> <PB N="16" REF="16"/> to
nothing, and which was corroborated only by an intercepted letter, and even
that—the rest not proved—would also fall to the ground.</P>
<P>The proof alluded to was the very letter which Standfast
fancied had not been sent, but, upon fur∣ther enquiry he found himself
mistaken; yet, as it had made no alteration in Lady Hazard, he was convinced
it had not been properly delivered, and was afterwards confirmed in that
opinion, when he found it had been given to Lady Roebuck's foot∣man.</P>
<P>In fact, Lady Roebuck's servant, on that very fatal afternoon,
delivered her a letter at Lady Ha∣zard's, where she happened to be waiting
for Sir Sidney, who promised to meet her there at tea time. Lady Hazard was
luckily writing letters in her own room, and her friend had just taken up a
favourite author, from which employ being interrupted by 
<Q REND="inline">'a letter for your ladyship,'</Q> she,
without further ceremony, opened it, and read these words: 
<LETTER>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P> I cannot refrain from acquainting you that your husband
has an intrigue with an infa∣mous woman, and you will be assured that I
tell <PB N="17" REF="17"/> you truth, when my intelligence is proved to you by
his staying out the greatest part of this night. Probably you may guess
the quarter from whence you receive this, and as revenge is completely in your
power, why not obey its dictates in favour of one who will not be ungrateful to
your incom∣parable charms?</P>
</LETTER></P>
<P> Sir Sidney, who came in while she was yet read∣ing it, cried
out, 
<Q REND="inline">'So, so, I have caught you in the fact, have
I? What tender epistle have you there?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Only a discovery of your tricks, my love,'
said she.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Read that; but, before you see a word,
remember I tell you it originates with Mr. Stand∣fast.'</Q></P>
<P>As this conduct was no less handsome than usual in Lady
Roebuck, her husband was neither sur∣prised at that nor at the contents
of the letter. In∣deed they laughed so heartily at it, that their mirth
served only to double their concern when, upon looking at the direction,
which neither of them had noticed before, they saw it was addressed to
Lady Hazard.</P>
<P>They were now indeed strongly confirmed it came through Mr.
Standfast, and after having insi∣nuated <PB N="18" REF="18"/> away Lady
Hazard's time till the lateness of the evening convinced them there was too
much truth in the letter, they retired, and, when alone, formed that
determination which we have seen so resolutely made at the end of the
first volume, and now almost abandoned at the very beginning of the
second.</P>
<P>The latter end of the letter Lady Roebuck thought could allude
to no other than Standfast; for though she had heard of the business of
Dog∣bolt, yet she could not avoid looking upon that to be overstrained, and
that the tutor at the bot∣tom was the object who wanted to recommend himself;
and indeed Lady Hazard, who wished to disguise nothing from her friend,
did not scruple to say there were times when she had similar
sus∣picions, though always, upon reflection, she was convinced she did
him wrong.</P>
<P>Mr. Standfast, being as conseious of all these matters as
if he had known their thoughts, com∣batted the effects of those resolutions
they had taken in the manner we have seen; and thus, though continually on
the brink of a discovry, he traversed the verge of the precipice on which
he was placed as securely, though not so harmlessly, <PB N="19" REF="19"/>
as SHAKESPEARE's peasant upon Dover cliff; for the peasant is described
as gathering a purifier of the blood, while the parson was searching for
what∣ever could inflame and corrupt it.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER II.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>A KIND OF WHITE CROW—THREE OTHER CURIOSITIES, AND A SAFE
ARRIVAL IN WARWICKSHIRE.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>As we shall have something to do with all those characters
which I have lately introduced to the reader's notice, it may not be amiss if
I men∣tion a word or two of each in this place.</P>
<P>The attorney, whose name was Balance, had long been a great
favourite of Sir Sidney; not because he had a remarkable number of
enemies—though that was very often a sufficient reason for the
baronet to espouse a man's interest—but because he had great
professional integrity and private worth. I shall in a moment explain how
this gentleman conjured up such a host of foes, by saying that he
mortally hated roguery, though a lawyer. Indeed it had been doubted, by many of
his brother professors, whe∣ther his odd notions and strange practice did
not so decidedly operate against that strongest of all laws, custom,
to the detriment of the general interest, that a point might be made to
strike him off the rolls. <PB N="21" REF="21"/> For, said they, very
learnedly, 
<Q REND="inline">'as usage has, time out of mind, regulated
laws; as usage has esta∣blished that it shall be lawful for attornies
to ap∣propriate to themselves not only the money, goods, and chattles, lands
and tenements, wives and chil∣dren, consciences, peace of mind, nay even the
liberty and lives of their clients; and as this said lawyer Balance
absolutely rejects in toto, all such general power over his clients,
shamefully con∣tenting himself with moderate and reasonable re∣compence
from those in whose behalf he has suc∣ceeded, and scandalously
declining to prosecute and pursue to their ruin, such as he plainly
sees have been already plucked and pillaged, till they totter under the
weight of their accumulated mis∣fortunes:—quere, whether, by trampling
upon custom, which is paramount to law, and explain∣ing justice and equity
to be the same thing, which, for the better promotion of cavils and
arguments, have been considered, time immemorial, to have distinct and
different meanings, and looked upon as things that ought to be for ever kept
separate and apart, the said lawyer Balance ought not to under∣go a heavy
censure of the court for the first offence, to be suspended during
pleasure for the second, and if, upon returning to practice, he should be
found infringing this custom, this usage, this law, this justice, this
equity, a third time, then, <PB N="22" REF="22"/> and in that case, to be
considered as incorrigible, and rendered incapable to practise in his
majesty's courts of justice!'</Q></P>
<P>No one of these gentlemen, however, being pa∣triot enough to
rise up and rescue the laws from the gripe of so bold an innovator, he
went on with this illicit practice to the great terror of the petti∣fogging
tribe—many of whom he had caused to be struck off the rolls—and
to the admiration of all good men, and, among the foremost, his particular
friend Sir Sidney.</P>
<P>We come now to the artists. These were the same who had
visited Roebuck hall for the last three years; for though the baronet had
formerly made a point of having a new set every season, he at last gave
up that plan, finding, upon taking them in∣discriminately, that he brought
home with him little more than a cargo of vanity, ignorance, and affectation.
Having searched, therefore, with great care, and met with three a little more
to his mind, though they certainly were strange kind of oddities, he stuck
to them, and being now accustomed to their singularities, and finding
nothing in them that exceeded folly, they really furnished him with a fund of
amusement, independant of their profes∣sional abilities.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="23"/> The poet, Mr. Ego by name, was, at least
in his own opinion, as much any thing else as a writer. He knew every thing,
and, what is very extraordi∣nary, better than any body.</P>
<P>The painter was a professed satirist; his talent lay in
caricature; and he blended the ideas which were conveyed by his pencil with his
conversation.</P>
<P>The musician was a striking contrast to the painter; for
he was as remarkably civil, if not ser∣vile, as the other was severe.</P>
<P>I cannot do better than introduce the reader to them as they are
sitting over a bottle at the John of Gaunt.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'You are a devilish severe fellow, Mr.
Musquito,' said the poet to the painter.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'I?' said Musquito; 'not at all:—only
a sort of a HORACE upon canvass, that's all:—a bit of a teazer, or
so:—to be sure I can bite as hard as JUVENAL:—but why should
one torture flies?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'And why not?' cried the poet. 'I would not give
three-pence for a satirist who could not make any body miserable.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'I'll try my hand upon him,'</Q> said the
painter, speak∣ing low to the musician. Then turning to the poet, he went
on. 
<Q REND="inline">'Well said Ego! Well said ipse dixit! 
<PB N="24" REF="24"/> Well said I b' itself I! Well said proof positive!
Well said infallibility!! Upon my soul Ego you would have made an admirable
pope. Sir, he possesses every personal and mental qualification in
the same proportion of excellence compared to others—'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'as you do shameless effrontery,' re∣torted
the poet; 'so you see I excel you at your own trade; for I have said as
severe a thing as ever you did in your life, which has the advantage, unlike
yours, of being truth. I will appeal to Mr. Toogood?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'To him!' said the painter; 'a cre∣dulous,
easy, foolish, good natured—'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Ay, ay,' cried the musician, 'abuse my
credulity as much as you please, but give me credit for my good inten∣tions
at least.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'I do, I do,' said Musquito:—</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'You intend very well, I dare say, when you
praise a man's wisdom, and so you do when you praise his folly. In
short, in you human nature has such an advocate, that there is scarcely a
vice or a vir∣tue that you have not a commendation for!'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Poor Musquito,' cried Toogood, 'now upon my
soul thy shafts must be terribly blunt when thou canst find nothing
better to aim them at than me. I own my services are devoted to all who think
proper to make use of them.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'If they are rich,' answered Musquito drily;
'for you know Toogood why should the poor be flattered?'—</Q> 
<PB N="25" REF="25"/> 
<Q REND="inline">'Plague take you,' said the musician, 'I was
go∣ing to say that I wish to be civil to all mankind, and if I have, in a
few trifling instances, been mistaken, blame nature, who thought fit to
sow in the garden of life, among a plentiful crop of valuable plants, a
slight sprinkling of rascals and scoundrels. In short, Mr.
Musquito, I would not give up the luxury of thinking well of man∣kind, to
have Mexico for my real estate, Peru for my personal, and the mines of
Golconda for my <HI>menu plaisirs.</HI> What the devil would you have me
think, as you do, that every eye is divine into my heart, and every hand into
my pocket?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Nei∣ther would be worth while, Master
Toogood'—cried Musquito.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Come, come,' said Ego, 'I will finish the
dispute. This is the fact: you, Mr. Musquito, are over suspicious; and
you, Mr. Toogood, are over credulous. I am the man for this world: I steer
the middle course.'</Q></P>
<P>This company, upon Lady Hazard's recovery, se∣parated into two
parties; one of which set off for the seat of my lord, and the other for
that of the baronet; till at length, by the ringing of bells and the
acclamations of all the inhabitants, they were welcomed to Little Hockley and
Castlewick.</P>
<P>Sir Sidney threw his eyes complacently around 
<PB N="26" REF="26"/> him, which sparkled with the satisfaction of
be∣holding so many sincere adherents; and he did not at that moment a
little plume himself upon the hope of seeing his friend in
possession of the same solid enjoyment.</P>
<P>The meeting between Sir Sidney's friends and Annette was tender
beyond expression. My lord declared he never saw so sweet a creature.
Charles thought her handsome, but babyish. His mind in∣deed ran upon riper
charms, for he had so little of the delicacy of love in his composition,
that he con∣ceived himself a perfect Caesar, and having made so many
first sight conquests, he was yet to learn the pleasure of
solicitation.</P>
<P>It is a shame to talk thus of a boy of eighteen, but really
Mr. Standfast had so well remembered the conversation that passed
between him and Viney, previous to his introduction to Lord Hazard, that the
young gentleman had already experienced the secresy of the very same
surgeon whose cautious con∣duct we were witnesses of in the last
chapter. This gentleman, to say the truth, was a perfect HIPPO∣CRATES. As
well as the medical skill of that an∣cient, he possessed his
prudence; for he seemed to adhere to the famous oath of his predecessor,
in which he enjoined himself to make his patient's <PB N="27" REF="27"/> good
his principal aim, and that whatever he saw or heard in the course of his
practice, or otherwise, relative to the affairs of life, nobody should ever
know, if it ought to remain a secret.</P>
<P>The country and its amusements had infused such pleasure
and satisfaction into every member of this society, that nothing was seen
but cheerfulness.—They mustered up a tolerable concert at Sir
Sidney's, a thousand good humoured sallies circulated in the way of
impromptues and epigrams, and sketches of each others singularities were
handed about, to the no small diversion of all but those immediately
ca∣ricatured. Charles was pretty adroit in each way, and having a greater
licence, his strokes were bolder, and, in every other respect, at least a
match for the rest. In short, there was no part of their time un∣filled by
some pleasure to every person's taste; for it was a maxim with Sir
Sidney that all was fair in which there was no premeditated mischief. As for
the rest, Mr. Friend began to experience very agree∣able effects from his
efforts at Little Hockley, espe∣cially as they were seconded by the
exhortations of Standfast, who they knew had been a great sinner, and who
now assured them that he was become a great penitent.</P>
<P>Thus, possessed of every pleasure a smiling
coun∣try, <PB N="28" REF="28"/> profuse liberality, joyful hearts, and
ingenious heads could produce, their happiness would have been complete had
it not been damped by the indis∣position of Lady Hazard, who, a short
time after their arrival in the country, evidently fell into a gra∣dual
decline.</P>
<P>This, in a great measure, prevented Lord Ha∣zard from a
participation in the general happiness, and gave occasionally no little
uneasiness to Sir Sid∣ney and Lady Roebuck. My lord, however, in proportion
as he shunned the general hilarity, courted the charms which he found in
private me∣ditation, and the exercise of that benevolence to which he was
so forcibly stimulated by Sir Sidney.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER III.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>THE ARRIVAL OF A NEW GUEST—AND THE DEPARTURE OF AN OLD
ONE.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>MATTERS wore this face when Charles, who had been in continual
anxiety relative to the situation of Miss Figgins, saw her brother one
morning ride into the park. It was about the time when the young gentleman
flattered himself he should become a father, and having accosted Mr.
Figgins, who re∣turned his salutation with bare civility, he was con∣vinced
this manly achievement of his had been crowned with the expected success.
Relying how∣ever on the friendship of Mr. Standfast, he felt ra∣ther
satisfied than otherwise on the subject, and im∣mediately appeared as
coldly civil as the young cler∣gyman.</P>
<P>Mr. Figgins was shewn to Mr. Standfast, with whom he held a
long conference, the result of which our hero waited for with impatience; and
he was not a little astonished when the two gentlemen came towards him in
terms of very high altercation.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="30"/> Charles could distinctly hear Standfast
say 
<Q REND="inline">'Come come, this is a little too
rascally.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Rascally!' cried the other.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Yes,' replied Standfast, 'for it is
impossible that you can be ignorant of her cha∣racter:'</Q>—and then,
seeing Charles, said 
<Q REND="inline">'Here is the young gentleman, and I confess
his conduct was imprudent enough, but sir, I tell you once again it was a
trap for him, and if it had not been for my positive injunction, so
honourable are his sentiments, he would have disgraced his family for ever
by marrying your sister, whom I can prove to be a woman void of reputation.
To tell you the truth sir, this was the cause of my silence, and as I am
convinced you must have been privy to the whole business, you need not
expect any further countenance from my lord, the bishop, or any other of my
friends.'</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Figgins declared that if Mr. Standfast could in the
smallest degree prove what he asserted, he should abandon his
sister as a wretch unworthy his protection. He protested his total
ignorance of her character, and solemnly assured Mr. Standfast he knew
nothing of the intrigue between her and our hero, till—seeing her
palpably in a condition that would shortly bring disgrace on him,
particularly because of his profession and connections—he taxed her
with the fact, and she, with great unwillingness, <PB N="31" REF="31"/>
discovered to him what had passed. He uttered a very florid speech on
the subject of ingratitude, and declared he should detest himself if he
could be ca∣pable, even was his benefactor—meaning Mr.
Stand∣fast—to withdraw his countenance and protection for ever from
him, to meditate any return that could militate against those honourable
sentiments of pure and grateful acknowledgment which were eminently his
due.</P>
<P>Mr. Standfast confessed, till this business, he had
always considered him as a very thankful, proper, decent, grateful young
man:—nay he might recol∣lect he had given hints that there would be no
ob∣jection to count upon his future favour; and really, if he could acquit
himself—
<Q REND="inline">'Will you suffer me to speak?' said
Charles.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'As to Mr. Figgins, I most sincerely beg his
pardon for the irregularity I was guilty of in his house. That he should
know any thing of it is morally impossible; because his sister told
me that she sincerely believed he would be the death of her, if he found it
out; and, I assure you, this has at times given me so much anxiety, that
if I had not promised you, Mr. Stand∣fast, upon my honour—which I
hope will ever be a sacred pledge with me—to leave the whole to your
discretion, I certainly should, long ago, have written to Mr. Figgins, and
laid all the blame on <PB N="32" REF="32"/> myself, where it certainly ought
to fall: I am very happy to have this opportunity of coming to so proper an
explanation, and will readily abide by the determination of Mr. Standfast in
relation to my future conduct.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'My dear Charles,' said Standfast, 'your
con∣duct in this, as in every thing else, is perfectly handsome. Perhaps my
zeal for your honour and that of your noble father has hurried me too far, and
induced me to treat Mr. Figgins with more harshness than he merited. I will
take his word for what he asserts, because really, as I said be∣fore,
there has always been something about him like ingenuousness, gratitude,
and a proper sense of obligation.'</Q>—Here Figgins bowed—
<Q REND="inline">'If there∣fore matters go in the old train as to
him, I beg that it may extend to his sister.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'This is the point I wanted to come to,' said
Charles. 'I assure you we were both betrayed into what we did, for neither
of us originally meant more than a very harmless gratification.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Oh yes,' said Standfast. 'Come, come,
Charles, you might be a Lubin, but she was no Annette I assure you. No,
no, Figgins,' added Standfast, taking Charles by the hand, 'my pupil here,
whom <PB N="33" REF="33"/> I hope to see a duke, is no match for your
sister, even were there not that bar which I will hereafter convince you
subsists. In the mean time, let the bantling come forth, and be brought
up:—we will find a provision for it.'</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Figgins was now invited to spend a few days in the family,
to which he consented. Indeed the time passed so agreeably, that a
fortnight had elapsed before he ever dreamt of taking his leave. Charles,
during this interval, became very intimate with him, and Mr. Friend and the
good Mildman—which last declared he began to have hopes of Little
Hockley the moment the young gentleman had ap∣peared among them—were
charmed with his so∣ciety.</P>
<P>Nor must the reader, who knows his origin, too hastily
credit that I am advancing any thing unna∣tural or unlikely. Art does not
require brilliant talents, and no people in the world are so easily
im∣posed upon as good men. Pay but a modest deference to your own opinion,
that you may not seem too servile; struggle a little with conviction
before you appear to yield to it; and, though you give up points with
reluctance, never fail in the end to crown your adversary with the palm of
victory:—<PB N="34" REF="34"/> and be assured of friends wherever you
choose to make them.</P>
<P>Standfast knew mankind surely. This young man was bred up
under him; and as he had strong intellects, rather an engaging figure, a
retentive memory, a wonderful natural penetration, a col∣lected and shrewd
sagacity, with a fortunate knack of chequering his conversation with bits
and scraps of philosophy and morality, which he had studied, it is not at
all astonishing that he should be mistaken for a sensible and good
man by such as, could they have discovered any defects in him, would rather
have excused than exposed them.</P>
<P>Mr. Standfast, one day, having received some letters from
London, came to my lord, and in∣formed him that his uncle was at the point of
death. Of this uncle Lord Hazard had heard him speak, and always understood
he had great expectations from him. He therefore begged that no time might be
lost, but that the tutor should instantly set out to see his
relation. This was the more rea∣dily agreed to because Mr. Figgins could
stay to su∣perintend his pupil's studies, which indeed now consisted
of nothing more than reading and com∣paring different authors, a part of which
exercise <PB N="35" REF="35"/> he pleasures of the country took off; not to
reckon nis attention to painting and music, in both of which he was a great
proficient.</P>
<P>These preliminaries adjusted, Mr. Standfast took his leave
of his good friends in Warwickshire, and repaired to London; from whence, in
a short time afterwards, he informed Lord Hazard that, his uncle being dead,
he was left independant; but that he should still consider him as his
benefactor, and would, as soon as he should have settled his affairs,
wait on him. He anxiously enquired after Lady Ha∣zard, whom he had left in a
very declining state of health; hoped his pupil was pleased with Figgins,
whom he took the liberty to recommend as his tu∣tor, while he should need a
person in that capacity, and offered to relinquish in his favour that
annuity which his lordship had settled on him for life.</P>
<P>My lord replied in a suitable manner to this letter. He
wished his friend joy of his good fortune; drew a melancholy picture of Lady
Hazard's situation; enlarged most pathetically on his own treatment of her;
solemnly declared if he should lose her all his happiness would be at
an end; consented with plea∣sure to his proposal concerning Figgins, but
posi∣tively refused—though he was determined to take care of the
young man—to suffer the smallest resti∣tution <PB N="36" REF="36"/> of that which he, Standfast, had infinitely more than
deserved:—winding up the whole with a strong contrast between the
great and exalted me∣rit of his friend, and his own unworthiness.</P>
<P>In the mean time the summer was gliding away, during which
scarcely a day passed that did not bring with it some new pleasure;
but yet Lady Ha∣zard's indisposition was a cloud that dimmed this serene
sky. As most of these amusements however were calculated for the
alleviation of her pain, es∣pecially those which Charles
conducted—for he doated on his mother—their enjoyments suffered
but little diminution on her account. In the mean time our hero's sentiments
changed insensibly every day in favour of Annette, though really his heart
was yet a perfect stranger to the delicious sensations of delicate love;
and those he did feel, young as he was, upon so proper an occasion he
well knew how to suppress. He had some warm thoughts cer∣tainly as to
Emma, and knowing as much of books as herself, he very archly conceived a
design of con∣quering her with her own weapons; but, finding her virtue too
well fortified to yield to his solicita∣tions, he made an honourable retreat,
greatly to her satisfaction, who was not in the least angry; for virtue,
with her, was slender indeed that could not withstand every trial. On the
contrary, she ven∣tured <PB N="37" REF="37"/> to predict that Annette was his
destined wife, but foresaw his imprudence would cost many a mu∣tual heart
ach before the accomplishment of their destiny.</P>
<P>Charles certainly had not the smallest objection to
consider Annette in the light of an intended wife, nor was he by any means,
as I have already said, insensible to either her beauty or
accomplishments; and therefore—especially as he had the sanction of
both his and her parents—he paid her the exactest attention, and lost
no method nor opportunity of inspiring her with sentiments highly to his
advan∣tage. But he had ever set his heart on seeing the world, and that not
superficially, before he should sink into a domestic character, which
he always conceived would be a clog to the exertions of a vo∣latile mind, like
his; unless he could be assured, by repeated experience, that his partner
for life was possessed of those many and scarce attractions which
would so bind his inclinations as to make him prefer bondage to liberty.</P>
<P>The attention he paid Annette had, however, a different effect
on that young lady. Their little pleasures were, it is true, not more than
the sports of children; but there was such an unaffected ease, such
sweetness of temper, such an engaging and so <PB N="38" REF="38"/>
insinuating an address in our hero, without the smallest tincture of
art, or illiberality, that, with∣out her own knowledge, she imbibed the
seeds of that poison which, according to Emma's predic∣tion, was destined
to give her many a bitter pang.</P>
<P>Little Hockley was now improving very fast.—Mr. Balance
had routed the two attornies I for∣merly spoke of, who, upon examination,
were found to have practised without the smallest quali∣fication. The
painter had completed a picture of the return of the prodigal son, which was
placed in a conspicuous part of the church, and the musician had opened a
fine organ, the gift of Sir Sidney, un∣der which the poet affixed a very
elegant latin in∣scription, which Emma said ought to have been in
English.</P>
<P>It had been an invariable custom to celebrate the baronet's
birth-day by throwing open the doors of the mansion house, and feasting
all comers. In the afternoon several sports were performed on the green,
and, in the evening, the company retired to a very large rustic
assembly-room, where Sir Sidney always opened the ball; and after he had
seen that his tenants and neighbours had every thing they could wish for,
to give their pleasure free scope, he <PB N="39" REF="39"/> retired with
their warm and unfeigned good wishes for a continuance of his health and
happiness.</P>
<P>Since Sir Sidney's marriage, however, this festi∣val had been
kept on his wedding day, and this was called the grand feast:—for there
were three others to celebrate, the birth-day of himself, that of Lady
Sidney, and that of Annette. But these happening near each other, and Sir
Sidney not choosing to fill his tenants heads with too profuse an
inclination for pleasure, he held these festivals on the four quarter
days, when he never failed to lighten the hearts of those who, from
unavoidable necessity, could not be punctual with their rent.</P>
<P>There was something so remarkable in the con∣duct of the day
which united the two villages, that I shall take a fresh chapter to
describe it: flattering myself that no one will blame me for dwelling upon
a subject the fittest that can be to produce benevo∣lent ideas.</P>

<P>CARDS of invitation, containing the following words, were in due
time circulated at the houses of the neighbouring gentry.</P>
<Q> 
<P> Sir Sidney Roebuck's grand feast will be cele∣brated on

<P>Stewards 
<LIST>
<ITEM>Rt. Hon. Lord Hazard,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Charles Hazard, Esq.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Rev. Mr. Friend.</ITEM>
</LIST> </P> 
<P> The company is expected to arrive on Sunday evening, and not to
depart till Tuesday morn∣ing.</P></Q>
<P>The combined assistance of all who could be use∣ful was
solicited upon this occasion. The poet, painter, and musician produced a
masque in con∣junction, and Charles wrote and set an ode, as 
<PB N="41" REF="41"/> well as painted the decorations for it; and it was
allowed—though that might be the company's par∣tiality—to be the
completest performance of the day.</P>
<P>Lord Hazard's department was to receive the company, and
accommodate such as could not find room at Sir Sidney's. Charles had the
manage∣ment of the amusements, and Mr. Friend, assisted by Mildman and
Figgins, undertook to preserve decency and decorum. The company which
ar∣rived on the Sunday evening were served in the apartments provided for
them, and permitted to sup and retire at their own time.</P>
<P>At six o'clock on the Monday morning, the two villages were
awoke by ringing of bells, a dis∣charge of cannon, and other demonstrations
of joy. This done, several messengers were dispatched to request
their attendance at a rural amphitheatre fitted up for the purpose, in the
front of the rookery. There, by eight o'clock, the company assembled; and,
after a short but pathetic hymn to the deity, had breakfast served up to
them by children, in white and flesh-colour dresses, ornamented with
flowers, who drew the most delicious beverages from a variety of urns,
distributed about in niches.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="42"/> Coffee, tea, and chocolate, were relieved
by ca∣pilaire, orgeat, lemonade, and sherbet; while the most odoriferous
perfumes mingled their artificial sweets with the roses and jessamine,
that shed their emanations as they interlaced the surrounding treil∣lage.
Cakes, comfits, and liqueurs, were seen in great variety and abundance; and
after the com∣pany had amply refreshed themselves, during a per∣formance of
the most touching and melting airs, each Ganemede and Hebe moved a spring,
and instantly played in the centre of every alcove a foun∣tain of rose
water, for the use of ablution; which ceremony was succeeded by a
proclamation, that every one was at liberty to take separate diversion till
eleven o'clock, when they were expected on the lawn, in order to go to church
in procession.</P>
<P>This procession, though simple, was striking. It was
preceded by twenty-four wool-combers, each of whom carried some ornament of
their profession. Twelve others followed, with banners, on which were
displayed a variety of ingenious devices.—Twenty-five inhabitants of
Castlewick, and as many of Little Hockley, succeeded, one of each place
linked arm in arm, in token of brotherly love. To these succeeded a band of
music:—then came the stewards with golden wands, who were followed by
<PB N="43" REF="43"/> their assistants with silver ones. Lady Roebuck,
Lady Hazard, and Annette came next, in an open carriage: these were
succeeded by a large number of other carriages, and these again by about
two thousand spectators.</P>
<P> Being orderly seated at church, the service was performed,
and an excellent sermon preached by Mr. Mildman, from the text 
<Q REND="inline">'There is more joy in heaven over one sinner
that repenteth, than over ninety and nine just persons, who need no
repentance.'</Q></P>
<P>The service over, they returned in the same
or∣der—with this difference:—twelve morrice dancers met them on
their way, and conducted them in a mazy round to the lawn, where all
dispersed, and, after promiscuous ambulations about the garden, retired
to dress for dinner, which, at three o'clock, smoaked in the grand
saloon, for the company within doors, and on the lawn for all who chose to
partake of it.</P>
<P>In the saloon Lady Roebuck held her state, and Sir Sidney
played the humble host. Annette, on one side, sat with all the blooming
freshness of a new blown rose; and, on the other, poor Lady Hazard,
pallid as a drooping lily. On the table <PB N="44" REF="44"/> was elegantly
distributed a most sumptuous feast, admirably contrasted, and
delicately served up. Nor did their pleasure receive a small addition
from the hearty vacant mirth that assailed them from the lawn—which
the saloon overlooked—where sat as many happy guests as could
surround an ox, two bucks, and four sheep, all roasted whole; at which
Emma sat in imitation of Lady Roebuck, and the butler—who was the very
servant so faithful to Sir Sidney in France—attended, like his
master, to sup∣ply the wants of the company.</P>
<P>Many loyal toasts were proclaimed by a discharge of cannon,
and pledged by the company without. At length the lawn was cleared, coffee
introduced into the saloon, and, in a short time after, notice given that
the ode written by our hero was going to be performed in the rustic
amphitheatre, where the company had breakfasted.</P>
<P>The saloon was now prepared for the masque, to which the
company were desired to repair in fancy dresses, but without vizors.
Previous however to the performance, as soon as it became sufficiently
dark, they were led by the morrice dancers through a serpentine walk to the
canal, where, on the oppo∣site bank, was discharged a most superb
firework, in which the painter had exerted himself in orna∣mental 
<PB N="45" REF="45"/> transparencies, and the poet in apt de∣vices.</P>
<P>The masque over, it is impossible to express the
universal astonishment when, upon returning to the lawn, they found it
converted into beautiful alcoves, tents, booths, and other receptacles for
different par∣ties, where boys and girls, in the most picturesque fancy
dresses, ran before them, ready to anticipate their very wishes. Nothing
could exceed the beauty proportion, and disposition of this city of the
plea∣sures, reared as it were by enchantment. Those who were not
disposed, however, to resort to it for refreshment, were attended and
served in a manner equally desirable in a suite of rooms in the house;
and as to Emma's company, in addition to a review of all these pleasures at
a becoming distance, they had their own rural assembly room for their
supper and ball, where I am well informed not one, within some hours,
guessed what it was o'clock, till the sun sent forth those streaks
of crimson which put an end to their harmless merriment on the Tuesday
morning.</P>
<P>Nor did their superiors separate one whit sooner, and not
then without regretting that their pleasures were at an end, and declaring
that they never wit∣nessed such taste, nor experienced such
hospitality.</P>
<P><PB REF="46"/> It may not be improper to notice some of the
principal remarks made on this occasion.</P>
<P>Annette remarked that Charles looked, spoke, and did every
thing divinely. He remarked that she was a lovely little creature; and all
the company remarked that they seemed born for each other.—Emma
remarked she had made a conquest of the poet, the musician, and the
butler; and well know∣ing the fidelity of this last to his master, and
affec∣tion to his young mistress, declared, as she undressed Annette,
that she should have no objection, at a proper season, to be the author
of his happiness.</P>
<P>The poet remarked Emma was a smart wench, and should be his;
for he was the man in the world for her purpose. The musician agreed to the
first remark, but thought they neither of them stood any chance; and the
painter, overhearing them, swore she was a caricature of mother Shipton,
and they were damned fools for talking such nonsense.</P>
<P>Lord Hazard remarked that he had now but one wish in the
world; and Sir Sidney remarked—but not to my lord, that this was the
first time their grand feast had been graced with the presence of Lady
Hazard, and he greatly feared it would be the last. Indeed that amiable and
charming lady, <PB N="47" REF="47"/> lest she should diminish the
general hilarity, exerted herself on that day beyond her strength, and
though probably the utmost human care—for she had every
assistance that money or influence could procure—could not have
wholly restored her, yet, certainly, her now rapid decline was accelerated by
the various shocks, though of temporary pleasure, which she received in
assisting to promote the happiness of her friends.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER V.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>A DISPUTE BETWEEN EMMA AND THE POET.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>As this is the only entire summer the reader and I are to
pass in Warwickshire, I shall explain pretty fully how the time jogged
on. So far it is pretty evident every man's leisure had been taken up to
prepare for the festival, which some may think I have a little too
particularly described. It has, how∣ever, brought about something,
according to my usual custom; for it made Lady Hazard worse, which, but
for the sake of moral truth, I sincerely wish had not happened; it lost
Emma's heart; and it did two or three other things, which will be di∣vulged in
proper time.</P>
<P>This grand affair being over, the spare time was filled up
with lighter and less regular pleasures; among which Charles, in
particular, found the con∣trary dispositions of Sir Sidney's scientific
trium∣virate excellent food for his frolicksome temper, which, though it had
not the smallest tincture of <PB N="49" REF="49"/> mischief in it, loved
to indulge itself with exposing absurdity. To this Master Figgins egged
him on with all his persuasion, with no view, however, as he said, but to
oblige the young gentleman; nor, to say the truth, did Sir Sidney want a
relish for such fun, when every thing was kept within proper decorum.</P>
<P>It did not signify what the joke was, their argu∣ment upon it
produced all the amusement. Charles very often set the poet down to a
literary contention with Emma, who, being skilled in authorities, ge∣nerally
conquered him; for really dates and facts are very good materials for
criticism, and method will very often be too hard for genius. Upon these
occasions the poet was thrust further into a corner by the satiric
painter, and consoled by the accom∣modating musician. One afternoon,
however, she gained so complete a triumph, that he was obliged, for a long
time, to own himself conquered.</P>
<P>The reader remembers that Emma had a very great predelection for
Dr. JOHNSON, and Charles en∣treated the poet to attack the lexicographer. This
he did not fail to do, but kept, for a long time, to general accusations.
Emma desired he would give her some opportunity of answering him. 
<Q REND="inline">'Any <PB N="50" REF="50"/> man,' said she,
'may be made to look contemp∣tible. ARISTOPHANES contrived this of SOCRATES,
who, because he was a man of inoffensive man∣ners, and therefore naturally
decried the licentious writings and conduct of the comic poets, provoked the
fury of this satirist:—but even though this is true, and though
Madame DACIER was so charmed with this author that she
translated—and, not content with that, read two hundred times, and
every time with fresh pleasure, the very piece that was written to render
this great philosopher ridi∣culous—yet it proved nothing, because
general assertion is a blunt arrow that falls without in∣flicting a
wound.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Well, what do you say to this?' cried
Figgins, who stood by.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Say!' cried the poet, 'If she wants proofs of
what I have asserted, she shall have them; I am the man for adducing
proofs. And first of all, has he not written a severe satire on
himself, when he says of SWIFT 
<Q REND="inline">"that on all common occasions he habitually
affects a style of arrogance, and dictates rather than persuades?"</Q> In
another place, 
<Q REND="inline">"he predominated over his com∣panions with a
very high ascendency, and proba∣bly would bear none over whom he could not
so predominate."</Q> Now does not Mrs. THRALE, after a confession that
she had surfeited herself with an <PB N="51" REF="51"/> abject and
indefatigable attention to him for a number of years, such as no man who did
not in a most insolent degree predominate over his com∣panions could exact,
does she not declare she could no longer bear him, and that she went to
Bath because she knew he would not follow her? Is not Mr. BOSWELL every
moment frightened to death lest there should be a total breach between
them? Does not the Doctor meditate an entire separation only because Mr.
BOSWELL had the im∣prudence to leave him for a few minutes, with truly the
shameful intention of contributing to his ease and convenience? What do you
say to all this? Does not this convince you that my assertions are
truth?'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'No, no, sir,' answered Emma, 'we were to
talk of a poet, you are speaking of a man.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'A good evasion,' said Ego, 'and in the
Doc∣tor's own way. I am the man for seeing what people are about:—but
come, you shall have him as a poet. And pray, does he not wish to destroy
the very being of poetry, by insisting on annihi∣lating mythology? Does he
not find it very re∣prehensible in Mr. GAY to introduce Cloacina and the
nightman in his Trivia? and does he not abuse poor PRIOR most unmercifully
for fabling that <PB N="52" REF="52"/> Chloe was mistaken one day by Cupid for
Venus, and another for Diana? In short, mythology is, with him, puerility. He
says of Collins that he loved faries, genii, giants, and monsters! and that
while he pursued these objects, he did not suffici∣ently cultivate
sentiment: when all the world knows that there is an end of poetry if
sentiment is no longer to be conveyed through so rich and beautiful a
vehicle. What do you say to this abuse of the gods and goddesses? Is
not it shame∣ful?'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'No sir,' said Emma, 'not at all, for a man
may abuse such imaginary beings without injuring any body's moral
feelings.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Another evasion,' cried the poet, 'I will be
judged by any body. But I will go a plainer way to work. Here is a criticism
of his that is stark nonsense. In speaking of Mr. GRAY's lines on the
death of a cat that was drowned as she at∣tempted to catch a gold fish, the
last line says, that all that glitters is not gold; nor if it were, says
the doctor, would the cat have been the better for it, for a cat does not know
the value of gold. Now I say she does, in the sense it is here meant,
which is nothing more than that we are not to trust to appearances; and a cat
knows that, as far as her <PB N="55" REF="53"/> understanding goes, as well as
a man. Can you controvert this, Mrs. Emma? No, no, I am the man for close
reasoning. All that glitters is not gold sure enough. What do you say to
my argu∣ment?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'That it is not sterling, sir,' said
Emma.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Your learned principal would have given the
same vague answer,' said the poet.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Come, come, why does he take no more notice of
COLLINS's ode than if no such poem had ever been written? Can you answer me
that?</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Easily, sir,' said Emma; 'it was written
for music, which he did not understand.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'It is a pity then,' said the poet, 'that he
did not understand it; for he cannot shew such harmony in his own poetry,
which is the heaviest—'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Sir,' said Emma, 'he was profound.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Verbose,' said the poet.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'He compiled a dictio∣nary of the English
language,'</Q> answered Emma. 
<Q REND="inline">'Zounds,' cried the poet, 'you would make a man
mad; I am a man that is never in a passion, but damme madam—'</Q></P>
<P>Here every body interfered, and it was universally allowed
that Emma had gained a complete victory. 
<Q REND="inline">'Yes,' said Emma, still imitating Dr.
JOHNSON, 'my triumph is complete; for if Mr Ego has no∣thing to say
<HI>for</HI> himself, the logical conclusion is, that all he can say
<HI>of</HI> himself must be <HI>against</HI> himself, for these are
the three distinctions of egotism.'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="54"/> This witty warfare stuck hard with the
poet for a good while: he got off, however, as well as he could; for when the
painter, with his usual acri∣mony, told him that he ought to hide his head
for ever, after being conquered by a woman, and the musician, in his old
accommodating manner, said he plainly saw Mr. Ego had yielded the palm from
the abundance of his natural complaisance, Ego cried out, you are right, my
dear friend Toogood, I am the man that knows how to behave polite to a
lady.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER VI.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>CONSISTING OF SHAM GHOSTS, AND A VALIANT TAYLOR.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING this repulse which the poet sustained from
Emma, he had really a penchant for her, and as she loved reading, he
flattered himself he should succeed by acknowledging her victory over him
in the dispute already mentioned, and submit∣ting tacitly to her opinion in
all literary matters.</P>
<P>This amorous intercourse, at least that which appeared so
to the musician, began to make him a little uneasy, for he flattered
himself with pretty near the same hopes as the poet. Seeing this, Charles
and his associates hit upon a plan which they thought would afford them
some amusement.</P>
<P>Charles very archly intimated to Toogood that Emma, in her own
mind, gave him the preference, but, added he, you will lose her owing to your
ab∣surd diffidence. In short, after proper preparatio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> he proposed to him a scheme which he said would 
<PB N="54" REF="56"/> <GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/> 
<PB REF="57"/><GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/><PB N="56" REF="58"/> evince his love for Emma, even without wounding his modesty by
declaring it, would bring out her real sentiments towards him, and would
finally frighten Ego into a relinquishment of his preten∣sions to her.</P>
<P>The kind Mr. Toogood agreed to the proposal with but little
hesitation. It was this: the asso∣ciates were to report that the
musician had hanged himself for love, and, to give it a colour, while he
hid himself in a garret—where, by the way, they almost starved him,
under a pretence that nobody could come to him for fear of a
discovery—his fian∣nel powdering gown was put upon a stuffed figure,
and hung as it were artfully by the neck to a staple in his bed chamber; and
this was shewn to the poet, in the dusk of the evening, in a way so well
managed, that he really took it for the musician.</P>
<P>The poet, willingly enough, ran, as he was de∣sired, for help,
and, in the interim, the powdering gown was shifted from the figure to
Toogood him∣self, whose face had previously been smeared by the painter
with a composition of a cadaverous hue; there∣fore, when he returned, and
found Toogood stretched upon the bed, he had not the smallest doubt but
that he had made his final exit. Pre∣sently afterwards Emma came into the
room, and <PB N="57" REF="59"/> being properly instructed for the purpose,
began to lament her hard fate, and to utter so many tender things in favour
of the musician—calling him her Orpheus, her Amphion!—In short
she flew into such apparent rapture, that Charles and Figgins feared the
crotchet-monger would have jumped up, and appeased her upon the spot. She
said this country was now deprived of a second PURCEL, but where could they
find another DRYDEN to record his praise?</P>
<P>Ego answered briskly, that DRYDEN to be sure was a very
pretty poet, but there was one yet in the world, he flattered himself, as
capable of singing the virtues of a deceased friend as most people.</P>
<P>Emma took him at his word, saying she feared she should
never be able to bring herself to love him—though she would try what
she could do—yet her friendship he might always command, if he would,
as a last tribute to his friend's memory, write his epitaph.</P>
<P>This settled, the company dispersed. Charles lifted up his
hands, Figgins blessed himself, the poet in profound meditation,
Musquito swearing it served the fool right, and Emma quite in a tragedy
rant: The poet desired he might have a slight sup∣per <PB N="58" REF="60"/> in his apartment, and pen, ink, and paper.—The musician, who
had acted his part very well, was locked up, and every body retired.</P>
<P>Ego was heard for some time to walk about his room in great
agitation, and afterwards to draw his chair and sit down very still to
work. In short, he had finished the task just at that moment 
<Q> 
<L>'When church yards yawn,</L> 
<L>'And hell itself breaths forth contagion to the
world!'</L></Q></P>
<P>Being charmed with his production, he began to read it aloud,
and afterwards was heard to exclaim, 
<Q REND="inline">'I never was so successful in my life!
Once more—'</Q>and then reading—
<Q> 
<L>'Here Toogood lies, by desp'rate passion
<HI>drove,</HI></L> 
<L>'Who, great musician, hanged himself for
love!'</L></Q></P>
<P>He scarcely had uttered these words, when open flew the
door, and the musician appeared in his powdering gown, with a halter round
his neck, ex∣claiming in a hollow voice 
<Q REND="inline">'And so I did, perfidi∣ous poet.'</Q> The
bard, like Pierrot—though the musician looked that character more than
he did—now began to stare, to tremble, and, without quit∣ing either the
paper or the candle, blundered to the further side of the bed, where the
ghost, with a most <PB N="59" REF="61"/> ghastly grin, glided after him.
Seeing himself fol∣lowed, he sprang across the bed at the expence of his
shins, and out of the door, the ghost hard at his heels, when hurrying down
the stairs—which were strewed with peas, unknown to either of them,
they rolled over each other till they lighted on a feather bed, purposely
laid at the landing place, where all the company in the house burst in at
once, and found them cuffing one another almost as un∣mercifully as Mr. POPE
makes the two eagles in HOMER.</P>
<P>The musician began now to perceive that he had been duped as
well as the poet. Sir Sidney said he was sorry to find the musician had
played upon so ridiculous a chord; to which Charles answered, his
performance was perfectly in the amoroso style.—Emma said that to
be sure he had given a dying proof of his love, but not knowing that he would
recover, she, out of despair, had chosen another.—The painter
said it was not the first time Mr. Too-good had made himself ridiculous.
The poor mu∣sician, getting up, laughed the matter off as well as he could.
He said his known character was to ac∣commodate himself, as much as
possible, to the plea∣sure of the company; and as to the poet, he said
he suspected it was a trick from the beginning, for he was the man at
discoveries! He swore he would <PB N="60" REF="62"/> have acted a dead man
ten times better; and as for a ghost! 
<Q REND="inline">'Damme,' said he, 'if I had personated a
ghost, I would have scared you all out of your wits!'</Q></P>
<P>After a hearty laugh, Emma finished the business by a few
serious words, saying, that they had both hung themselves up as marks of
ingratitude, in re∣turn for Sir Sidney's hospitality; yet, if the ghost of
remorse did but haunt them a little, for enter∣taining a wish to injure a
poor girl, who had no∣thing to depend upon but her character, she should,
for her own part, think them sufficiently punished.</P>
<P>A truce was struck, and good humour restored, or rather
prolonged; for none of the parties enter∣tained the least rancour: on the
contrary, the mu∣sician was the first to confess he had been justly
re∣proved for his error, and Ego said he was an ad∣mirer of poetical
justice, which he flattered himself he had exemplified pretty strongly in
his writings.</P>
<P>About this time a matter happened which had very nearly undone
some of Sir Sidney's pious work at Little Hockley. One John Swash, a
miller, who was at the head of a large family, and one of the first who
repented of his former idle tricks, had been set up by Sir Sidney, and had
lived for some <PB N="61" REF="63"/> time in comfort and credit. This man, at
the in∣stigation of some litigious persons, who envied his present good
fortune, had been taken up for sheep-stealing: a crime which he certainly
had committed some years before. He was to be tried at Warwick, at the
summer assizes, and Sir Sidney greatly feared the fact would be fully
proved; in which case, it would be difficult to save the man.</P>
<P>But this was not the worst, for a number of the Hockleyites,
having been guilty of crimes equally enormous, might, on his conviction,
emigrate from the village, where they began to live peaceable and decent lives;
and thus he should lose the fruits of that benevolent harvest which he
had been so long and so carefully bringing to perfection.</P>
<P>There was but one man who could swear to his identity; except
indeed a companion, who having been formerly discharged by a magistrate, on
ac∣count of this fact, now appeared as king's evidence, to curry favour with
the farmer, whose sheep had been lost, as well as to screen himself
from future prosecutions.</P>
<P>This man, who, as I said, could swear to him, was a taylor,
and lived, at this time, in pretty good credit at Wellingborough, but had
formerly worked <PB N="62" REF="64"/> as journeyman at a small town not far
from Little Hockley, and when business was not very stiring there, was
glad enough to job about at other places, and return to his wife and family
with the earn∣ings.</P>
<P>He had been three days getting ready some mourning for a
family in the neighbourhood, when, being upon the point of returning on a very
dark night, he was reminded, by some officious friend, that he must go
seven miles about, for that over the common, which was but little more than
three, he would certainly meet with the ghost.</P>
<P>It must be understood that on this common was erected a
gibbet, where were hung in chains two smugglers, who had murdered an
exciseman; and under this gibbet every evening were seen—for a great
number of the inhabitants within some distance round were ready to swear
it—two men in white marching with much deliberation, and carrying a
coffin.</P>
<P>The taylor had frequently heard all this, but as it rained a
little, and the way over the common lay so much nearer than the other, he
could not think or going round:—besides he was perfectly, at this 
<PB N="63" REF="65"/> time, pot valiant, and one more glass put the
finish∣ing stroke to his resolution.</P>
<P>Away went the taylor with his wages in his pocket, and his
goose suspended on a stick, which he held over his shoulder. When he
came near the gibbet, sure enough he saw two men carrying a coffin. His
sensations may be easily guessed at. He was seized with so
strong a fit of horror, that his teeth chattered, his legs shook, he
trembled from head to foot, and sweat at every pore. He made an effort to run
away, but his limbs refused their of∣fice. At length, as the spectre
approached, with one frantic struggle, between fear and desperation, his
well-poised goose flew from the staff that sup∣ported it like
lightning, and hitting the head of the ghost that was nearest to him,
brought him to the ground—when lo! open flew the coffin, and out jumped
two sheep!</P>
<P>The other spirit, unconscious that he had only one-ninth of
an adversary to encounter, took to his heels, and soon disappeared. The
first, however, stunned by the blow he had received, could not so
easily get out of the taylor's clutches, who being convinced of the fact by
the information of the two sheep, pursued his victory, and actually tied
the <PB N="64" REF="66"/> culprits hands with a large piece of list, in order
to carry him before a magistrate.</P>
<P>The sheepstealer pleaded very hard for his liberty as soon
as he came to himself, when the taylor, knowing his voice, presently
recognized him for the very same John Swash, who now, at the distance of
almost three years, was confined in Warwick jail for this individual
offence.</P>
<P>The general opinion was that the taylor had com∣passionated
the situation of John for a valuable con∣sideration, which was, in the
nature of a fine, to be paid by installments, but had not been regularly
discharged. Finding however that the offender be∣gan to be pretty well off in
the world, the subject was revived, and the matter carried by the farmer, at
the instigation of the taylor, to the length we have seen.</P>
<P>These were the circumstances which made Sir Sidney uneasy.
He plainly saw that Swash was picked out not with a view to offer a public
sacri∣fice at the shrine of offended justice, but merely to be used as
an instrument by way of experiment, to see how much money could, upon
similar occasions, be extorted in future:—for knowing the baronet to 
<PB N="65" REF="67"/> be very warm in whatever he espoused, the two
pet∣tisoggers who were driven from Little Hockley, and a few others who
accompanied them, counted upon a comfortable subsistence, which they had
no doubt they could procure by raising contributions, in like manner, upon
the generosity of Sir Sidney.</P>

<PB REF="68"/>
<HEAD>CHAPTER VII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>THE SEQUEL OF SWASH AND THE TAYLOR.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>The difficulty seemed to be how to suppress the evidence
of the taylor without Sir Sidney's apparent concurrence; for it was not enough
that he should not seem to take any active part in the business, but it
was necessary to regard it as a matter of perfect indifference to him.</P>
<P>On this account, it was necessary to be very wary in their
measures. Charles and Figgins, how∣ever, undertook, after a very little
reflection, to re∣move all difficulties.</P>
<P>The plan was explained, and greatly approved; and now came the
time to put it in execution.</P>
<P>A house was taken about three miles from War∣wick, whither
Charles, Figgins, and the body of arts repaired; which last were informed
that the <PB N="67" REF="69"/> removal was only temporary, to take views, and
at∣tend the assemblies at the assizes.</P>
<P>About a month before the assizes, Charles and Fig∣gins rode
to Wellingborough. The latter having pre∣viously rolled his coat in the road,
and splashed his horse on one side, they went to the first inn they
saw, where they enquired if there was a clever tay∣lor in town, who could
make a coat at a short warning. The landlord recommended one, but not the man
they wanted; but, rather than make ob∣jections, they determined to see him,
and when he came found fault with every thing he produced: which indeed they
were determined to do with fifty, till they should see the object of their
present busi∣ness. At length he came, and there never was such a
taylor! They were struck with his taste, his manner, his price:—In
short, the poor devil was in raptures, though a man must have been very
ingenious to find language for this lavish praise in favour of a card of
buttons, and some snips of cloth. So it was however, that the taylor never
found out half so much merit in himself as at that moment. He made his men
sit up all night, and a very awk∣ward coat was produced in the morning for
Fig∣gins, which, nevertheless, was the pink of taste, and the extreme of
the new fashion; and Charles pre∣tended to be so much in love with it, that
he ordered <PB N="68" REF="70"/> a frock for himself, with the addition of a
new Bir∣mingham button, with which he declared himself enchanted. This frock
however he could not stay for. It was therefore ordered to be sent to the
house of the Rev. Mr. Figgins, near Warwick, where it would be paid for on
delivery.</P>
<P>The taylor said he should be at Warwick at the assizes,
for he was subpoened there upon a trial, and he would then, if the gentleman
pleased, take the liberty of calling, to see if he was satisfied with his
coat.</P>
<P>Figgins said he should be very glad to see him, for that
he knew no character so respectable as a tradesman. This was said as
they took horse, and the taylor, making a very low bow, retired. The
circumstance was however so singular, that the landlord, as well as the
taylor's wife, set down Charles and Figgins for two cheats, and cautioned the
taylor not to be taken in.</P>
<P>The taylor had himself some suspicions akin to theirs,
though the flattery that had been lavished on him almost overcame his
wariness. However, to make all sure, as he had some business at
Warwick,—indeed no other than to con his lesson as to his evi∣dence 
<PB N="69" REF="71"/> against Swash—he took that opportunity of
carrying home the coat himself.</P>
<P>Being arrived at Mr. Figgins's, he was very kindly welcomed,
detained all night, paid his bill, and informed that more clothes would be
sent for, to be got ready against the assize ball; to which our hero
added, 
<Q REND="inline">'I wish we could prevail on you, sir, to
settle here, for there is not one of your profession within twenty miles
who knows even how to set on a button with taste.'</Q></P>
<P>The taylor acceeded to the fact, took a comforta∣ble portion of
merit to himself, and went home in high spirits.</P>
<P>Swash was to be tried on the last day of the assizes, on
the motion of the counsel, and three days previ∣ous to the trial an order was
sent to the taylor from our hero for some clothes for the assize ball.
The taylor could not refuse to execute the order, but, nevertheless, very
anxious to be in time for the trial, was determined he would be at Warwick the
night before.</P>
<P>A servant being dispatched to suggest alterations and
delays, till he should be detained very late that evening, he at length
arrived, clothes and all, at <PB N="70" REF="72"/> Mr. Figgins's, about half an
hour past eleven o'clock, most exceedingly fatigued.</P>
<P>Figgins took him very cordially by the hand, and led him into a
parlour, where, at near one—the clocks being put back almost an
hour—supper ap∣peared. The taylor protesting he never was so
dis∣posed to make a good meal in his life, fell to very heartily. Thus the
time passed on till within a quarter of an hour of day light, though by the
clocks—being once more put back—the taylor did not believe it so
late by two hours. At length he was led to bed completely drunk. Having slept
till two o'clock in the afternoon—which will not ap∣pear extraordinary if
we consider his drunkenness and fatigue—he awoke, without
recollecting for some moments where he was. When he felt, how∣ever, a fine,
soft, stately bed, he began to have some faint idea how he came there;
but, as every thing appeared as dark as pitch, he concluded it was in the
middle of the night, and turned to go to sleep again; this, after tumbling
and tossing for half an hour, he effected, and taking another pretty good
nap, waked about half an hour past six.</P>
<P>Feeling a violent head-ach, and finding himself intolerably
hungry, he could not help thinking the night remarkably long. He got out of the
bed, and <PB N="71" REF="73"/> groped about for the windows, and having drawn
one of the curtains, opened the shutters, but it was all the same. He could
not throw up the sash in∣deed, owing, as he supposed, to a mode of
fastening it, which he did not understand. He was yet con∣vinced, however,
that it was not near day light, and therefore determined to go to bed
again.</P>
<P>In groping out his way, he caught hold of the tossel of a
bell, whieh immediately tingled very forcibly. This frightened him out of his
wits.—How could he apologize in a gentleman's house for making such a
disturbance? After he had been in bed about a quarter of an hour, in anxious
hope that nobody had heard the bell, a servant came into his room, with a
candle, yawning, stretching, and rubbing his eyes, who asked him what he
would be pleased to have.</P>
<P>The taylor begged his pardon a hundred times, for disturbing
him, though it was nearly seven in the evening, and asked what o'clock it
was, and how long it would be till day light?</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'O'clock, sir!' said the servant, why we
han't a been in bed above a quarter of an hour; I believe there will be a good
three hours yet before the cock crows.'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="74"/> 
<Q REND="inline">'Three hours!' cried the taylor, 'why I never
passed such a night in my life! Three hours!—why I seem as if I
had lain twenty; and then I am so cursed hungry.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Ay, that is your long jour∣ney, sir,' said
John.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'I don't know what the devil it is,' said the
taylor, 'but could not you, my dear Mr. John, get me a bit of something for
the tooth?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Lord love you, no such thing,' said John;
'you must e'en stay till morning.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Morn∣ing!' cried the taylor, 'why I shall be
famished in three hours; I never had such a craving in my life.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Well, well,' said John, 'then I will see
what I can do; but I must get the keys of old Mother Search, the
house-keeper, and she is a devil of a crusty toad, I can tell
you.'</Q></P>
<P>The taylor implored him to see what he could do, and John
said he would return directly. He did not, however, make his appearance for
another half hour, when he brought word that there was nothing to be had.</P>
<P>This news the taylor was obliged to swallow in∣stead of the
repast he had expected, and wishing John a good night, endeavoured once
more to get to sleep. This however was impossible; he kicked about,
turned, twisted, got up, lay down, and be∣tween whiles, fell into a kind of
dose, till night <PB N="73" REF="75"/> actually came. His patience was now
entirely ex∣hausted, and, for the first time, he suspected that some
trick had been played him. The whole con∣duct of this family had been so
extraordinary, that he began now to reflect on his neighbours' suspi∣cions;
but then, how could that apply to him?—he had nothing to be robbed of.
They might mur∣der him, however, but what harm had he done to any body? Perhaps
it was all a drunken frolic:—perhaps it was day-light all this time.
Whatever it was, he might be sure no servant would set him right; he was
therefore determined to sally forth, and know the truth of every thing.</P>
<P>So resolved, he immediately put on his clothes, and groping
out the door, met with no impediment all the way to the garden, where, by
feeling about, he soon found himself. Here he gave that credit to the
stars which he denied to John, and being now convinced his brain was
affected, he thought he could not do better than return, without giving any
further disturbance to the family. This, however, was not so easily
practicable as he imagined. The door had shut after him in such a manner,
that he found it out of his power to open it.</P>
<P>His situation was now truly deplorable. He durst not knock,
for fear of making more disturbance in <PB N="74" REF="76"/> the house. In
the mean time he was devoured with hunger, and being in a strange place, in
the night, his fancy transformed every bush, not into an offi∣cer, but a
ghost.</P>
<P>These apprehensions were not a little heightened by a
variety of noises, which now assailed his ears. Clanking of chains,
groans, and howls fixed him petrified to the spot, while strange lights,
which came and disappeared, added not a little to the hor∣rid workings of his
teeming fancy. At length some∣thing tapped him upon the shoulder, when
turning round in an agony of fear, he saw, as plain as ever he did any thing
in his life, John Swash staring him in the face. What at this moment were
the poor taylor's sensations! He squeaked, kicked, plunged, without being
able to take his eyes from this dread∣ful object, till presently his sight
failed him, his muscles were all relaxed, and he measured his length on the
ground.</P>
<P>A few tweaks by the nose and some cold water brought him a
little to himself, when he found John and another servant lifting him up.
This circum∣stance did not a little facilitate his recovery. The moment he
got the use of his speech, he cried out, 
<Q REND="inline">'For the love of God, dear christian
gentlemen, speak to me! Oh Lord, is he gone? Did you <PB N="75" REF="77"/>
see him? Oh dear, dear, dear, dear—there he comes again! Hold me
fast!—don't let him fly away with me!'</Q></P>
<P>John and his fellow servant had some difficulty to comply
with his request, he struggled so hard, for fear gave him the strength
of a giant.</P>
<P>The spectre approaching, the taylor's fear, or rather horror,
was beyond description 
<Q REND="inline">'There,' cried he, 'Don't you see it?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'See what?' said John, 'I see nothing but
the trees and the stars, do you Thomas?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Not I,' said Thomas.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Come come, sir, doo ey goo to bed—yow
han not a slept to night. When the woine a be got out of your head, yowl be
in your right wits, like a sober parson.'</Q></P>
<P>The ghost now began to speak. 
<Q REND="inline">'Hush, hush,' cried the taylor.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Oh Lord have mercy upon me, save and deliver
me. It speaks! Oh John Swash, John Swash, how have I offended
thee?'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Oh miserable taylor, listen to me,' said
the ghost.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'I will John indeed,' said the poor
terror-struck wretch,</Q> and now the ghost went on.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'For the lucre of gain thou didst try to hang
me. <PB N="76" REF="78"/> though well thou knowest I never did thee harm; but
I have escaped thy malice, for rather than bring disgrace upon my poor wife
and family, I made away with myself. Now if thou wishest to sleep
peaceably in thy bed, make a full confession of thy wickedness to Sir
Sidney Roebuck, and through him restore to my unhappy family that money which
thou hast at different times frigh∣tened me out of. Remember, and let not my
an∣gry spirit visit thee a second time.'</Q> So saying, the ghost
disappeared.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Lord have mercy, save, deliver, and forgive
my sins,' said the taylor.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'What d'ye toak a∣bout?' said Thomas.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Pardon a poor, wretched, miserable sinner,'
exclaimed the taylor.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Come come,' said John, 'it will be time
enough to say your prayers when you are up in your room.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'How can you be so blasphemous?' said the
taylor, 'did not you hear what he said?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Who? Who?' cried John.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Why the man's out of his wits.'—</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Who!' exclaimed Snip, 'why poor John Swash; I
have killed, I have murdered him, and his blood will be on my hands.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Odds wounds,' cried Thomas, 'these be odd
sort of speeches; I do not wonder yow be troubled in mind, if yow a done
such wicked things as these:—but coom, yow be only a sleep, and a
dreaming.'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="79"/> In short, the trembling taylor was at
last con∣veyed to his room, where he lay sweating and shi∣vering, and
almost suffocated under the clothes, till day-light.</P>
<P>He now got up, and saying his prayers longer and louder than
ever he had done in his life, he be∣gan, though still in bodily fear, to
consider how he should prevent a second visit from the ghost. As
however the family was not yet stirring, and he thought he had made pretty
sufficient disturbance in it already, he returned once more to bed, where,
having undergone so much mental and corporeal fatigue, he fell into a sound
sleep, which probably saved him from a severe fit of sickness.</P>
<P>The reader has seen that the windows had been purposely
blocked up, on the first night, on the out side, to cheat the taylor,
through the whole of that day, into a belief that it was not yet light; by
which means the trial of Swash came on, and he was ac∣quitted for want of
evidence; for as to the confede∣rate, Figgins had seen, and so completely
intimi∣dated him, with threatening to lay a detainer against him on another
score, that he purposely prevaricated on the trial, and the whole
business was dismissed as frivolous and vexatious. The noise which
the taylor heard when he was in the garden, and which <PB N="78" REF="80"/> his
fears had so greatly magnified, was nothing more than the taking down the
blinds, which, as I have said, on the outside were affixed to the
windows.—But the ghost was no other than the individual John Swash,
who had been released in the afternoon, and properly tutored for the
purpose.</P>
<P>The taylor, at the proper time, was summoned to breakfast in
the parlour, where he was kindly re∣ceived by Mr. Figgins and Charles, as well
as the poet and the musician:—the painter being gone to take a walk.
They informed him they were ex∣tremely sorry to hear he had been so ill in
the night, and the poet, pretending to know something of physic, felt his
pulse, which having done very grave∣ly, he declared that the gentleman was
not so ill in body as that he was troubled with thick-coming fancies that
disturbed his rest.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'That's very true, sir,' said the taylor,
'you have found out my disorder at once.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Well but can't you cure him of that?' said
Figgins.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'No,' answered the poet gravely, 'in that
case the pa∣tient must administer unto himself.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Thank you sir,' said the taylor; 'it is
very true—he must indeed—and so I will, if it shall please
God, be∣fore I am many hours older.'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="81"/> 
<Q REND="inline">'You see, you see,' said the poet, 'I know
all the symptoms of this disorder. You are very hungry sir, are you
not?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Yes sir,' said the taylor, 'I dare say I
could eat a shoulder of mutton, and look round me.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'A bad symptom, sir,' said the poet.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Pooh, pooh,' cried Charles, 'I will never
believe that a hungry sick man is in much danger. Come John, let us have the
breakfast, the gentle∣man will be too late for the trial.'</Q> Then
address∣ing himself to the taylor: 
<Q REND="inline">'When do you expect it to come on sir? I hope
you will convict the ras∣cal; for really times are come to such a pass
that an honest man cannot keep his property in safety.'</Q></P>
<P> The taylor's countenance underwent several alte∣rations, and
he faultered out, 
<Q REND="inline">'why sir I don't think it will come on at
all.'</Q> Here John came in with a smoaking plate of toast. 
<Q REND="inline">'Zounds, let us fall to,'</Q> said Charles. 
<Q REND="inline">'Come sir, help your∣self.'</Q></P>
<P>The taylor began to put a piece to his mouth, when in came the
painter. 
<Q REND="inline">'Your servant,' said Figgins, 'where have
you been this morning?'—</Q>
<Q REND="inline">'Faith,' said Musquito, 'I have been to
see a very unpleasant spectacle, I assure you. A poor fellow, one
Swash, who was to have been tried this morn∣ing <PB N="80" REF="82"/> for
sheep-stealing, poisoned himself last night in his cell, and, through
the interest of Sir Sid∣ney Roebuck, the coroner's verdict was returned
lunacy, and they are now carrying the body to his wife and children.'</Q></P>
<P>Here the tea and toast dropt out of the taylor's hand, and he
entreated, for the love of God, that he might be conducted to that very Sir
Sidney Roebuck, for he could not eat nor sleep before he disburthened his
conscience of something that lay very heavy on it.</P>
<P>Every one affected extraordinary surprise at this
declaration; after which, Mr. Figgins said 
<Q REND="inline">'Sir, I am a clergyman, and if I can do you any
service by hearing your confession, and giving you salutary advice, I
will do it with pleasure.'</Q> To which the terrified taylor—looking
about him—said, 
<Q REND="inline">'No sir, that won't do; I am afraid he will
appear again if I tell it to any body but Sir Sidney.'—</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Appear!' said Charles, 'Who? Who will
ap∣pear?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'The ghost sir, the ghost!' said the
tay∣lor; 'John Swash's ghost!'</Q></P>
<P>A gentleman now desired to speak with Mr. Fig∣gins, who
being ushered in, proved to be Sir Sid∣ney.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="83"/> The moment the taylor saw him, he fell
upon his knees, and cried out 
<Q REND="inline">'Oh dear sir forgive me.'—</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Forgive you!' said Sir Sidney, 'why who are
you?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Sir,' said he, 'I am the taylor, the wicked
taylor that tried to hang John Swash.'</Q></P>
<P>The baronet was then informed of all the ghost enjoined Snip,
and at length, on his earnest entreaty, went apart with him to make an ample
confession. This indeed amounted to nothing criminal in the taylor, except
the extortion of the money; but it laid up such a body of evidence against
the emi∣grants from Little Hockley, as the baronet had no doubt would put a
stop to their nefarious attempts for the future.</P>
<P>The taylor's confession being signed and sworn to, he
was permitted to eat a voracious breakfast with John, for nothing after this
could prevail on him to come into the parlour.</P>
<P>A large cavalcade now appeared in the road, which poor Snip, as
well as every body else, knew to be the judges, who were leaving Warwick to
open the assizes at Worcester.</P>
<P>The taylor, though no great conjuror, saw plain∣ly he had been
tricked. He now neither wondered <PB N="82" REF="84"/> at his
restlessness nor his hunger, and lest he should any longer remain
in doubt, John Swash himself—who softly entered the
kitchen—tapped him upon the shoulder once more, saying, 
<Q REND="inline">'Master Cabbage, you have twice taken me for a
ghost, beware of the third time.'</Q></P>
<P>The taylor received a very wholesome admonition from Sir
Sidney, who explained to him in very pa∣thetic terms, the cruelty and wanton
maliciousness of disturbing the quiet of a man and his family, who, he
said, were objects of great compassion, as well as praise; for there
were very few instances of those who had so given themselves up to bad
exam∣ple, as to have been guilty of every wickedness and depravity, and
afterwards desirous of returning from their vicious courses. He said
there was no encouragement to which such objects were not en∣titled. How
reprehensible then was it in those who waited for the moment when such
should return to virtue, and, in consequence of their honest in∣dustry,
become in tolerable circumstances, to seek for opportunities to
distress and harrass them, and so prevent the happy effects of their
laudable and honest endeavours.</P>
<P>As for the taylor, he told him he was well con∣vinced he had
been set on by others, and as he had <PB N="83" REF="85"/> now made a candid
and fair confession relative to all those dark conspiracies which he
plainly saw were levelled against these poor repentant sinners, if he
would go on a little further, and join with him in detecting this knot of
villains, he might rely upon his favour; and he would enjoy a much higher
satisfaction—that of discharging his duty as an ho∣nest man.</P>
<P>The taylor was suffered to depart, after faithfully
promising all that had been enjoined him, and Sir Sidney was, for the first
time, let into the whole of the mystery by which the taylor had been
prevented from appearing at the trial; for it must be under∣stood that Sir
Sidney knew the taylor was to be kept away, but he did not know in what
manner.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER VIII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>A NEW CURE FOR AN AMOROUS FEVER.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE housekeeping of Mr. Figgins, near War∣wick, being now
broken up, Charles and his friend returned to Hazard house, and Musquito,
Ego, and Toogood to Roebuck hall.</P>
<P>Charles had noticed that Musquito, in conse∣quence of his
satiric vein, had conceived himself a kind of superior to his two
companions; for when∣ever it came up in conversation that they had been
ridiculed in the business of the ghost, he took care sagaciously to
hint that no one dared play him such a trick.</P>
<P>Our hero was therefore determined to leave him no room for
exultation, especially as by the mode through which he intended to shew him
off, as well as the rest, he should do even a more meritorious act than he
had done in saving Emma from the persecutions of the poet and the
musician. This method of studying mischief, only by way of in∣flicting 
<PB N="85" REF="87"/> merited punishment, was a species of amuse∣ment in
which it has been seen our hero delighted. It certainly was highly
praiseworthy in one sense, for it turned every thing off with a laugh
only against the offender, whereas, had it been shaped into a complaint,
and preferred against him to Sir Sidney, it might have endangered the hopes
which he built on his patronage.</P>
<P>John Swash had a daughter, who must have had an uncommon
mind for her situation in life; for, from her earliest infancy, she was
remarked to have had a detestation to that vice which surrounded her. She
profitted by avoiding bad examples as much as others by imitating good ones. In
short—which is the strongest proof that can be given of the
excel∣lence of her heart, and the incorruptibility of her honour, she, at
eighteen, was as spotless a character at Little Hockley, as the most
innocent inhabitant of her age and sex could be at Castlewick.</P>
<P>The painter had long laid siege to this young creature, who
had all that beauty which regular features, rosy health, and a perfect
symmetry of form can give. He drew her likeness, and took care it should
be a flattering one. He took a sketch of the mill, and made it a present to
Swash, whose professional pride was thus tickled. He painted a 
<PB N="86" REF="88"/> favourite tortoiseshell cat for the mother, and, in a
variety of other instances, made his talents subser∣vient to his
wishes; but, in particular, he vaunted that he had been the principal
instrument in de∣taining the taylor from appearing at the trial.</P>
<P>I know not if the girl's gratitude on the side of her duty
pleaded in his favour, or whether nature began to whisper to her that, good
as she was, love—as somebody has expressed it—is the
sovereign end of our being; but certainly she began to listen to the
painter's conversation with pleasure, and as she had never in her life
been controlled, scrupled not to walk with him in an evening. She soon,
however, repented of her complaisance, and was almost fatally convinced on
what terms these oppor∣tunities were requested. She resented his
insolence, which was manuel as well as verbal, and without ceremony informed
her mother of all that had passed, who, good woman, I am sorry to say
it, did not make such forcible objections to it as the daughter did. To say
the truth, she had a large fa∣mily, and looked upon her daughters as much in
the light of traffic, as her barley meal. In short, won by a handsome
sum, a promise of painting her picture in the attitude of milking a
favourite cow, and a half anker of genuine nantz—with shame I write
it—after but little hesitation, she agreed to <PB N="87" REF="89"/>
this method of providing for her girl as she called it.</P>
<P>This good woman, in her youth, had been toler∣ably handsome
herself. Master Flush had been heard to intimate that he fancied the
governor—meaning Standfast—had taken care to provide a birth in
heaven for Master Swash, in the month of April; but I am afraid nobody had
so strong a claim to that favour as Lord Hazard.</P>
<P>Charles had eyed this girl with pleasure, but would not for
the universe have given way to the shadow of an impulse to her
dishonour. And here it may not be amiss to beg the reader will stop with
me, and admire how greatly to our own advantage we take resolutions which are
in favour of virtue; for it is within possibility that, had our hero given
way to an inclination natural enough for a youth of warm blood to entertain,
and I hope full as natural if there were any thing like honour in his
disposition, to conquer—hear it ye seducers of virtue! Ye
merciless triumphant despoilers of innocence! who are cruel because you
have power!—insolent be∣cause victorious!—hear it, and reflect
with horror on the miseries that to often result from your vices,—he
might have contaminated a sister!!</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="90"/> From so deplorable a crime, however
uninten∣tional, did Charles, by his perseverance in his ho∣nourable
resolutions, very probably escape; for he, by his frequent chat with this
girl, had taught her bosom to glow with tenderness, but having put the
curb, as we have seen, upon his wishes, and ceased to be particular from
the moment he was apprehen∣sive of danger—during which interval the
painter stept in—she found some pleasure, which the reader may be
assured is not unnatural, in listening to lan∣guage of the same kind
from another, even though it was not so eloquently worded, or so gracefully
delivered.</P>
<P>As Charles withdrew his attention from this girl upon a ground
for which she loved him still more—for he made no scruple of
confessing the truth—the poor girl having been repulsed by her
mother, as we have seen, or rather encouraged to make her fortune, according
to the old gentlewoman, by that which, according to any body else, would have
been her ruin, was walking solitary and unhappy by the side of her father's
mill-stream, when Figgins and our hero passed by. Charles saw the
pearly tear standing on her cheek, and very good naturedly enquired the
cause. After a little reluctance she informed him, and concluded her
artlessly pathetic <PB N="89" REF="91"/> story with saying 
<Q REND="inline">'Indeed it is a sad thing when a poor girl's
mother bids her to be wicked; but I won't be wicked, if I am ever so
undutiful I won't.'</Q></P>
<P>Both Charles and Figgins commended her laudable resolution,
and now occurred an admirable oppor∣tunity of punishing the painter in his
own way. He immediately told the girl of his intention; to for∣ward which,
she was desired to acquaint her mo∣ther that she would be a good girl,
and behave civil to the gentleman, and, when he came, she should make him
an appointment in the dusk of the even∣ing in the bed chamber; that he would
let her father privately into the secret, who should, in concert with them,
so revenge himself upon her audacious lover, as to leave him very little
relish for such a∣musement in future.</P>
<P>The girl was charmed to find her cause taken up so warmly by
our hero, for she knew, let what would happen, the painter must not dare to
com∣plain.</P>
<P>The assignation was made, and Swash apprized of the whole
business. The painter, as may naturally be supposed, attended
punctually, and the husband being, as it was imagined, safe at the ale
house, the <PB N="90" REF="92"/> amorous Appelles was conducted to the young
lady's bed chamber, by her accommodating mamma, and desired to go to bed,
where he should be made as happy as he could wish.</P>
<P>He had not lain long in this situation, before he heard a foot
upon the stairs, when immediately his heart beat high, his fancy anticipated
the expected pleasure, and all his senses were in an alarm; but, however,
all these were nothing to the alarm that presently followed. In
rushed—at least his fears made him believe so—half a dozen
myrmidons; pop half a dozen times went half a dozen pistols; the first of
which was a sufficient intimation that the salute had very little of love
in it. Indeed he won∣dered how it came that he was not a dead man, for his
fears had wounded him in twenty places.</P>
<P>The very first of these hints he took, and darting out of
the foot of the bed, he presently cleared the landing place, and gained the
bottom of the stairs; by which time he received a few more compliments of the
same kind. These, however, though they were unnecessary to refresh
his memory, hastened his departure, which he took without paying the
smallest compliment to any of the family, but rush∣ing out at the
street door, made his way across a paddock, which led to the road; his
pursuers still <PB N="91" REF="93"/> popping at such a rate, that he
verily believed he was flying from a whole platoon.</P>
<P>Being come to a bank, he collected his whole might to jump over
the hedge, into the road, but the distance being greater than he imagined, he
plunged, with all his force, naked as he was, into a bramble bush, which
clinging in a hundred places to his shirt, and in as many to his flesh,
pinned him down so firmly, that he was obliged to make several excruciating
efforts to free himself. He did so how∣ever at last, but finding
himself surrounded with enemies, who were still popping at him, he
doubled as artfully as any Jack hare, and was followed as closely, with this
difference, that the game opened instead of the pack; for he yelped, howled,
swore, ejaculated, cursed, and prayed, in such a strange collection of
hysterical tones, that the musician, who was then present, had as much
reason to be enraged as Hogarth's, for all the complicated din there
des∣cribed, seemed to be centured in one person.</P>
<P>This discordance however did not last long, for trying to
cross the mill stream by a bridge, which to be sure had been laid down an
hour before, but was now drawn up, poor Musquito came souse over head and
ears into the water, which being in that part pretty deep, would have cooled
him for in∣triguing, <PB N="92" REF="94"/> and every thing else in this world,
had not a large fishing net been previously placed to receive him.</P>
<P>The net was immediately drawn up, which, with all the haste
they could make however, was not ef∣fected before the poor painter had totally
lost his senses.</P>
<P>He was now put into a shell, and the church being near,
carried to the bone house, where being held up by the heels, a quantity of
water ran out of his mouth, and he presently exhibited signs of life. The
moment this event took place, they hurried off with the lanthorn—the only
light they had—and the sexton, who, being a friend to the miller,
connived at the trick, immediately returned with his mattock and shovel on
his shoulder.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'There,' said he, as if to himself, 'that
job's done.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Oh d d d d dear,' cried the painter,</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'It is odd there should be nobody to own the
man,' cried the sexton, putting down his things.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'B b b oh—ah—oh—' cried the
painter.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'I have made him a good grave, however,' cried
the sexton, 'and as soon as the coroner's quest has sat upon
him—'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="95"/> The painter now mustered strength
enough to sit up, and cried, 
<Q REND="inline">'Oh d d d d dear—f f f f
friend.'—</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Lord, what's that!' said the sexton.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Oh f f f f for the love of God help me,' cried
Musquito.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Why lookee now,' said the sexton, 'here's
my man come to life. Lie down now doey; lie down, I ha been just making your
grave.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Oh Lord,' exclaimed the painter, 'my g g g g
grave!'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Ay ay, nobody will own you, you see, and so
we shall bury you to-morrow morning.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Bury me!' cried the painter, who had by this
time got out of the shell. 'Oh Christ, where am I brought to?'—then
looking round him—'Oh, dear friend have pity upon me.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Odds wounds,' cried the sexton, 'don't come
nigh me; I never could abide a dead body in my life, unless in the way of
business, and when it was screwed up, as a body may say: so don't
come nigh me.'</Q></P>
<P>The painter told him he was alive, the sexton said he was a
damned liar, and took up the lanthorn to be gone: the painter followed: the
sexton hol∣howing out 
<Q REND="inline">'the devil take the hindmost.'</Q> At length,
turning round a corner of the church, he blew out the candle, slipt away, and
the painter found himself alone, sore from head to foot, wet and naked, in
the middle of a church yard, above <PB N="94" REF="96"/> two miles from Sir
Sidney's, at half an hour past ten o'clock at night.</P>
<P>In this condition he posted to the alehouse, where he
intended to have trumped up a story of his being robbed, but his old friend
the sexton being the first man he saw in the room, he only desired the
use of some clothes, for which he said he would satisfy them
handsomely.</P>
<P>The man of the house agreed to accommodate him, and fetched
some things for that purpose, which Musquito put on before the fire; for
the landlady was gone to bed. In the mean time the guests were not sparing
of their jokes. 
<Q REND="inline">'Bless me,' said one, 'the gentleman has
been sadly mauled with zummet! He looks as if he had tumbled into a hornet's
nest.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Icod,' said another, 'I think its more like
being scratched with cats.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Very loikely,' said another, 'two legged cats
may hap.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Lord love you,' cried the sexton, 'you noas
no∣thing about it. The gentleman was tooked up in the mill-dam. They
mistooken for a vish.—Dam maw, I thoughten the biggest Jack I ever
sawed. And so as I was a telling you, when the gentleman coomed in, we took
un to the boane-house. Adds waunds measter, you do ought to 
<PB N="95" REF="97"/> give maw zummet to drink your health, after making your
grave.'</Q></P>
<P>The painter did not reply a single word to all this wit; but,
having hurried on the landlord's clothes, and said he would return them in
the morning, and satisfy him for his trouble, he sneaked to Sir Sid∣ney's,
and skulked up stairs to bed.</P>
<P>Charles and Figgins came in the morning to breakfast. Every
body was very inquisitive to know how it happened that the painter had not
supped at home. One said significantly he was perhaps better engaged;
another, that whatever his amusement was, he hoped it was to his liking. In
short, the poor painter was handsomely played off. At last it came to Sir
Sidney's turn, who said honest Swash had been with him that morning about
an affair something in the style of the soldier and the king of
France:—the soldier craved pardon for having thrown a man's hat out of
window, and, having ob∣tained it, said he had thrown his head out too.</P>
<P>Here Sir Sidney related the whole business of the preceding
evening, as indeed he had heard it from Charles, not from Swash. He concealed
his know∣ledge of the gallant, who, he said, was rightly served, and he
only wished the next time the gentleman, <PB N="96" REF="98"/> whoever he was,
took it into his head to corrupt innocence and destroy domestic peace, he
would never after having done so presume to come into his presence. He
concluded with reprobating the con∣duct of the mother, and heartily
recommending the girl to Lady Roebuck's notice, who declared, as Emma was in
want of an assistant, she should be im∣mediately placed about the
person of Annette.</P>

<PB REF="99"/>
<HEAD>CHAPTER IX.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>IN WHICH THE READER IS ATTACKED ON THE SIDE OF HIS
SENSIBILITY.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IT never, for a single moment, occurred to Charles that he had
wrought an event most wonderfully in his own favour by thus punishing the
painter; for Jude—so was the miller's daughter called—rang the
changes in his praise so continually, that, as her voice was the voice of
nature, and her sentiments strong genuine gratitude, his cause could not
even in Emma have had half so powerful an advocate: nay with Emma
herself:—for though she was well enough pleased that the youth had
conceived favour∣able thoughts of her, though she admired the ready
willingness with which he had corrected his error, yet there was, with her, a
distinct difference in the two cases. As to herself, she was a host
alone; she defied temptation; and, to such a youth as Charles, she was
rather pleased than concerned that she had had an opportunity of shewing
upon what erroneous ground he began his career, and what certain mi∣sery
would be the consequence of his persuting in <PB N="98" REF="100"/>
indiscriminate pursuits, in which he might be as∣sured, though he would
often dupe others, he would oftener be duped himself.</P>
<P>Emma represented to him that the sensations of a tender
and susceptible heart, which had given a sin∣gle pang to suffering
virtue, must be intolerable; and therefore conjured him to cease from a
conduct which was foolish as well as wicked, impolitic as well as unworthy;
for it was a barter of virtue for infamy, transient pleasure for lasting
pain: and however consonant to the boisterous and turbulent passions of
youth, would, throughout his life, be overshadowed by a cloud of
wretchedness, which the splendour of rank and distinction would vainly
struggle to dissipate.</P>
<P>To say the truth, this incident had touched Emma in the right
key; for if she gave Charles credit for his delicate and honourable treatment
of Jude, how much then was due to her admonitions which pro∣duced it?</P>
<P>If Emma had a weak side, certainly this was it. She was
perfectly a schemer on the side of virtue, and thought the passions
might be bottled up, like the winds of Aeolus; forgetting that there never
wants curious and turbulent spirits to let them out, <PB N="99" REF="101"/>
not only to excite fresh dangers, but make the case worse, by leaving no
remedy.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, nothing could be purer than poor Emma's
intentions, which, though they were not always infallible, hit nine times out
of ten as she wished they should. Here it was impossible they
should miss. Standfast indeed, had he so far con∣descended, would
have at pleasure changed the form of every one of them; and, spight of
Emma's pene∣tration, have shewn them, even to her, so deformed that she
should scarcely have known them for her own.</P>
<P>This gentleman, however, seems to be meditat∣ing at a
distance; and, as the course is left free for youth, sweetness, good
nature, and ingenuity to pay their open court to beauty, modesty, and
delicate sensibility, no wonder if, sanctioned by parents, strongly
supported by irresistible advocates, and their mutual wishes being in
their essence eminently congenial, a strong, and, one would think,
indisso∣luble compact must naturally be formed between Charles and
Annette.</P>
<P>To speak plain, which I, as well as Emma, think the best
way, so many were the desirable ends an union between this amiable couple
promised to ae∣complish, <PB N="100" REF="102"/> that, had it not been for
their youth—though probably they would not have found that an
objection—neither themselves, the fathers and mo∣thers, connections and
dependants, the two villages of Castlewick and Little Hockley—for
Little Hock∣ley was really now rising into same, in spight of Mrs.
Swash and her unworthy propensities, for which, between the reader and I,
she got well thrashed by her husband—not one of these I say but
would have blessed the day which united this lovely pair, and, what to
some of them would not have been an un∣welcome object, have produced an
extraordinary grand feast.</P>
<P>But whether fortune thought with Emma that virtues and
passions are given us to be exercised and controlled, or whether the
mind, like the constitu∣tion, is soberer in its age for having been taken
down in its youth, I shall not pretend to decide here:—certain it is
that the blind and varying god∣dess did not altogether take part with the
friends of our hero and heroine; the reason why, and the man∣ner how, she
thought proper to dissent from this otherwise unanimous opinion, will
hereafter be gra∣dually developed. In the mean time, I am really concerned
that, just when we find Charles and An∣nette in the full enjoyment of their
friends' admira∣tion, and that of one another, I should be under the 
<PB N="101" REF="103"/> unpleasant necessity of throwing as complete a
damp over all their spirits—such a scene of light and dark∣ness
is this life—as I had before presented to them of joy and
exultation.</P>
<P>I am sure the very name of poor Lady Hazard will anticipate
every word of the sad tale it is my un∣willing duty to relate. This amiable
lady, this lovely, this fatal sacrifice to complicated villany, whose fall
was doomed to tear the heart of him who in early life had departed from the
paths of honour: This charming victim, who it should seem by an error of
fate received the blow that was meant for her lord:—But it was no error;
it is blindness to suppose fate can err; he was to live, that in the
ex∣piation of his original guilt, his pangs might tor∣ture him with accumulated
keenness:—</P>
<P>Sweet Lady Hazard, who had seemed to decline with the
summer, had been for some weeks evi∣dently hastening to her
dissolution, when at length the solemn sentence of the physicians
precluded all hope. Indeed she felt that a few hours would put a period to
her sufferings, and desired, with calm resignation, that she might, for
the last time, see her friends about her.</P>
<P>This affecting request was soon complied with, 
<PB N="102" REF="104"/> for Lady Roebuck had been almost continually with her
from the moment she was in actual danger, and though our hero and his
companions had, at differ∣ent opportunities, employed their time as we have
seen, yet the most thoughtless of them would at any moment have flown to
have contributed in the slightest degree to her ease or comfort. In fact,
she was gliding out of the world by such imperceptible degrees, that, as
she supported her melancholy situ∣ation with wonderful fortitude, there
had ever been, till very lately, some slight hope of her recovery.</P>
<P>Lord Hazard had some time, by her own parti∣cular desire,
been left alone with his lady. Before however I relate what passed at this
affecting inter∣view, that I may not improperly interrupt the reader's banquet
of grief—which by some is thought to be a very delicious luxury—I
shall notice, in order, if possible, to heighten the loveliness of Lady
Hazard, and the wretchedness of her Lord, that, owing to some
expressions which fell from the sur∣geon, during the operation at the
John of Gaunt—which I have described as particular as was necessary
or delicate—she became acquainted with that secret which seems to
be set up as a beacon in this history to warn the reader that a very
small deviation from prudence may plunge a family into irretrievable
misery.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="105"/> The interview between Lord and Lady
Hazard was of that affecting kind that at once excites pity and terror. It was
one of those moments when the tongue denies relief to the heart, when nature
would sink but for the assistance of madness, and when the
pressure of calamity numbs the keenness of its tor∣ture.</P>
<P>Lord Hazard, overwhelmed with the recollection of his
unworthiness, and loaded with the self-re∣proaching consciousness of
his guilt, lay in a torpid stupor. His angel wife, though every sigh
hastened her departure, pitied his pangs, and sorrowed for his
sufferings. He, burning to disclose what shame forbid him to utter, and
she dreading a horrid tale she had long and silently anticipated!</P>
<P>In this state—that hand of death extended over her brow
which he would have given the world to have been directed to his—no
merciful tear to relieve his swolen heart, he must have expired with
exces∣sive sensibility, had not a few inarticulate sounds,
accompanied by a piteous sigh, burst from his tor∣tured bosom.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Be calm, my sweet love,' cried Lady
Hazard:</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Calm!' returned he</Q>—her celestial
voice penetrat∣ing his torn heart, and the tears gushing in torrents 
<PB N="104" REF="106"/> from his eyes—
<Q REND="inline">'Yes, calm as the pitiless butcher that kills
the innocent lamb! When thy spotless soul shall look down with just
horror and kind commiseration on thy polluted husband, and thy cruel
murderer, then tell me to be calm! Infuse thy incomparable innocence into my
culpable heart, inspire me with virtue, and teach me to be happy. See! Oh
heavenly God!—she hears me with sorrow, but not with
astonishment! She knew it!—'tis plain she knew it!—and my
foul crimes have, like the influence of a malignant poison, slowly
consumed her life! Pity, pardon, immaculate angel!—But my thoughtless
frenzy is too much for her tender frame. How are you, my love? She answers
wildly!'</Q>—And so indeed she did. Lord Hazard's violence had thrown
her into a delirium, in which she remained a few mi∣nutes, and then
expired!</P>
<P>The incoherent expressions she uttered during this
melancholy interval, sufficiently confimed Lord Hazard that his lady was but
too well acquainted with the fatal secret; and, lest he should not be
wretched enough at her loss, he had now the addi∣tional reflection that his
crime had first sapped the foundation of her peace, and afterwards
gradually destroyed her life. Regardless however of any dis∣covery, or
its consequences, he summoned every <PB N="105" REF="107"/> possible
assistance to her aid; but no syllable that es∣caped Lady Hazard
reached any ear, except that Charles, who first entered the room, heard his
mo∣ther fervently exclaim, which were the last words she uttered, 
<Q REND="inline">'If any blessings were in store for me, of
which I have been untimely deprived, shower them, merciful heaven, upon the
head of my dear boy.'</Q></P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER X.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>NEW MATTER.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>Having so completely thrown the two families in the country
into the vapours, as to make it im∣possible they should play any of their
whimsical tricks in our absence, the reader and I will take a look at Mr.
Standfast and his associates; and, as much as any thing, because it is
now high time that we should rescue that gentleman's fame from such an
opprobrious stain as that of having compassed the death of Lady Hazard,
and brought about that scene of distress described in the last
chapter, solely for the purpose of doing mischief.</P>
<P>I am ready to grant that no man upon earth had more
satisfaction in contemplating the wretchedness which was produced by any
one of his contrivances, but then I do insist that it was not so much for
the pleasure of the thing, as the collateral consideration; and I
sincerely believe, ill as I think of him, that could he have had the
smallest chance of doubling his <PB N="107" REF="109"/> advantage, be it in
profit or pleasure, by sacrific∣ing his whole party, he would not have made
a single scruple.</P>
<P>But, to argue this matter fairly. What had Mr. Standfast
gained by heaping all this complicated mischief on the head of his friend and
benefactor, but an addition to the salary which he had honestly earned by
being tutor to Charles? Why nothing literally, to be sure, as to himself.
As to whom then? This is an article that remains to be ac∣counted for. Again,
if Mr. Standfast, on his own account, received no other
satisfaction—which surely was a small reward for such eminent
villany—what other motive stimulated him? Revenge.—Revenge!
Yes:—and now let me get rid of these two articles. And first, as to
whom he seemed to be working for.</P>
<P>Know then reader that Mr. Standfast, the con∣summately
artful Mr. Standfast, whose superior talents in the craft of inflicting
unmerited calamity none ever attained, whose truly diabolical spirit never
conceived mischief complete unless the shaft with which it wounded
struck at virtue, who could cajole and cozen all the world, and dupe every
one else, was himself a dupe to—Mrs. O'Shocknesy!</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="110"/> Here is the collateral consideration,
but whence the revenge? From the same quarter. Mr. Stand∣fast, who held all
women as his slaves, who treated serious, reasonable, honourable love as
a banter; who mocked at the very idea of a solemn and sacred obligation to
a woman; this very Mr. Standfast,—pity him, oh pity him, villain as he
is—was a slave to Mrs. O'Shocknesy. Hence his revenge. He was her
first love; was the friend of him who killed her husband in a duel; she
had a child by him before she saw Lord Hazard, and would have married him,
but that his lordship stept in and carried her:—nay, let me whisper
to the reader, that it was not impossible but Zekiel was his son.</P>
<P>A number of doubts which the reader had before formed, are now
dissipated; nor will it be necessary to go again over the minutiae of
Mr. Standfast's conduct, which was dictated by her, though car∣ried into
effect by him; and, as she dared join os∣tensible acts to his covert
ones, what wonder if the unsuspecting virtue of Lord Hazard was
sur∣prised.</P>
<P>Her views and her ambition were obvious.—Lady Hazard was
to be put out of the way by a diabo∣lical contrivance, which, had it been
avowed, could have fastened nothing on its perpetrators. His lord∣ship 
<PB N="109" REF="111"/> would naturally be inconsolable for her loss, and
who knew if he would survive it, when he came to consider that it
originated in his guilt. Should this imaginary blessing be realized, her
son would come into possession of the title and estate; if not,
she would at least have the triumphant con∣solation that she had
imbittered his future felicity.</P>
<P>This conduct was natural and common, infa∣mous as it was. But
how shall we account for that of her paramour, who could not, fond soul,
rest in the country absent from her he loved. Charles, as to Miss
Figgins, was a stoic to him. The lady had promised, on the death of Lady
Hazard, to honour him with her hand, and instead of going to receive the
last benediction of an expiring uncle, his busi∣ness in town was to keep
from expiring the valuable love of the amiable Mrs. O'Shocknesy.</P>
<P>Thus, while friendship, obligation, and all other ties that
naturally induce gratitude, only stimulated Mr. Standfast to every
atrocious and rascally mea∣sure that could sap the foundation, and lay a
train for the destruction, of that love and harmony that were exemplary in
the family of his patron and be∣nefactor. The mere whim and caprice of a
wo∣man, whom he knew to be worthless, and com∣pletely the reverse of every
thing for which she could <PB N="110" REF="112"/> expect admiration, made
him—expert as he was at every thing artful, proof as he was against
every thing but self—undertake the most wicked, as well as the most
silly, things in nature. Here is a Hercules, not contented with wielding the
club—not quite so worthily, by the bye—he buckles to the
distaff.</P>
<P>It will be unnecessary for me to mention that Figgins was
sent for and fixed with Charles by Mr. Standfast's participation; nor will
it very probably have escaped the reader's sagacity that the whole affair
of Miss Figgins, who had not been with child, was nothing more than to hold
out a pretended se∣cret over the head of that young gentleman; for both
Standfast and Figgins well knew that there is not a stronger hold of a
grateful and generous heart than the knowledge of obligation: and this is the
sort of credulity I have described as a part of our hero's composition,
which, throughout his life, induced him to be thankful to others for lending
him imaginary benefits, that they might receive from him real ones.</P>
<P>But why should Charles be devoted to the same ruin with
others? He could not possibly hinder any one of their schemes. He had
nothing that could give them the smallest uneasiness. Was it 
<PB N="111" REF="113"/> then nothing to be the darling child, the hopeful
cherished favourite, while Mrs. O'Shocknesy and her son were turned into
the world, the sport of malicious tongues, and the vestiges of fallen
great∣ness? Charles—though were the records of the human heart
searched for every thing good and great that ever made up an amiable
character, the same marks of worth would be found in his:—Charles
must be traduced, must be vilified, it was necessary, it was material;
he must be sunk that his elder brother might rise. Besides, Mr.
Stand∣fast had a husband in his eye for Annette; a better husband;
since who can deny but a rich, sensible, thinking youth, as one will
appear, answers that description more perfectly than a poor, vicious,
dis∣sipated, inconstant wretch, as will be the character of the
other.</P>
<P>Reader, it was not Zekiel that our friend Stand∣fast had found
out for Annette. I know not if such an attempt would not have been a touch
even above his art; but, however, that young gentleman will probably shew, by
and by, that he would chuse to be consulted before any material step
should be taken that concerned him.</P>
<P>Master Zekiel had, at the time I am speaking, pretty decided
opinions, and one of them was to <PB N="112" REF="114"/> appear, however he
might really be, satisfied with all his mother and Mr. Standfast should
determine, unless they should ask him to sign any paper, which he was
fully resolved never to do.</P>
<P>As the reader has not yet heard the upshot of the business
relative to those letters wherein an applica∣tion was made for the grant of
the estate in War∣wickshire, I may as well inform him here that Sir
Sidney's application rendered that of Mrs. O'Shock∣nesy and her son
fruitless; therefore, through Standfast's advice, an addition was made to
the an∣nual stipend of the son, who immediately left Eaton, and went to
France, with Snaffle for his companion, and Flush for his valet; while
Dogbolt, who had long ago dropt his title, being a handsome fellow,
occasionally comforted Mrs. O'Shocknesy, when Mr. Standfast, who as yet
dared not see her, except by stealth, was out of the way.</P>
<P>Mr. Kiddy had taken good care to make himself particularly
useful to Zekiel, who swore there was so much fun and gig about the rum
dog, that he would rather have him for a companion than all the black-jacket
codgers in England.</P>
<P>Whether Kiddy had any latent meaning in the singular pains he
took to ingratiate himself with his <PB N="113" REF="115"/> young master, I
will not here enquire; but certain∣ly Standfast one day told him to take care
how he came on, to which Kiddy archly replied, 
<Q REND="inline">'Oh, as for that, master governor, don't you
go for to be uneasy: honour you know among thieves.'</Q></P>
<P>Thus have I shewn, when all things are consi∣dered, that
Standfast was the worst actor in his own farce. Nay I know not, upon all
great occasions, whether to the subordinate objects the whole praise is
not attributable. Trim says, while he is muster∣ing his tattered troop,
fifty thousand such ragged rascals as these would make an ALEXANDER,
and who can deny but the taylor and the mantua-maker tell truth when they say
that the splendour of the birth night is owing to them.</P>

<DIV2 N="11" TYPE="chapter">
<PB REF="116"/>
<HEAD>CHAPTER XI.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>A RECEIPT FOR BUILDING, BY BEGINNING AT THE
SUPER∣STRUCTURE.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>FOR want of leisure, or perhaps inclination, or for some
other wise reason, no less cogent, I did not mention to the reader that,
at the last grand feast, a young stranger appeared, and indeed attracted
a great deal of notice. He was then just arrived from Madeira, and brought
letters to Sir Sidney from a merchant there, with whom the baronet dealt for
wines, and transacted other business. Coming so opportunely, he was
invited to the feast, and cut, as I have said, no inconsiderable
figure.</P>
<P>Charles took great pleasure in accommodating this gentleman,
whose name was Gloss; studying his ease and convenience while he
remained in War∣wickshire. He requested the pleasure of corres∣ponding
with him, and begged his intimate friend∣ship when he should return to
England, with a view of settling, which he talked of doing after he should
have taken a trip to the Cape of Good Hope, where <PB N="115" REF="117"/> his
father had died immensely rich, on his return from India.</P>
<P>The winter had now began so to perriwig the trees, as
somebody has called it—by the way, some∣body and nobody are very
useful figures in rhe∣toric—that the semicircle of evergreens before
Sir Sidney's saloon, with the clusters near it, looked like a vegetable
court of judges and counsellors, in powdered ties and full-bottoms.</P>
<P>This hint, and a call of the house of commons—for Sir
Sidney had stayed in the country beyond his usual time, roused the
baronet, and made him be∣gin to think of putting on his boots. Yet not even his
duty, dearly as he loved it, could induce him to stir a step without Lord
Hazard, who was become what SHAKESPEARE says of life, 
<Q REND="inline">'a walking shadow.'</Q></P>
<P>Lord Hazard looked upon himself as the execu∣tioner of his
wife, and though his grief was inward, yet it did not escape such vigilant
friendship as Sir Sidney's. His lordship declared he would de∣vote
himself to retirement. His friends, however, at length prevailed; and, to
make the satisfaction complete and universal, Annette was, for the first
time, to see London, accompanied by Emma.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="118"/> It was the continual study of every one
to make Lord Hazard's time pass agreeably, in which plea∣surable task Mr.
Standfast now assisted, whose pre∣sence his lordship
confessed contributed greatly to relieve his care, though heaven knows he
had no such intention; for his visits were for no other pur∣pose than to
warn him of certain snares which Mrs. O'Shocknesy was not preparing for
him, in order, if possible, to entangle him in others that she was.</P>
<P>About Christmas arrived Charles's friend Gloss, from the
Cape of Good Hope, where he had, he said, settled his affairs greatly to
his satisfaction.—He brought answers to some letters with which Sir
Sidney entrusted him for Madeira.</P>
<P>As Mr. Gloss will hereafter cut no inconsiderable figure in
this history, it may not be improper to give some account of him. He was
the son of a clergyman, who, probably, knowing that the ad∣vancement in the
learned professions was a thing that depended less upon merit than
interest, had bred him up to trade: not sparing, however, to give him a
complete education, which he very pro∣perly thought could do him no harm in any
situa∣tion.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="119"/> One thing, however, was very romantic in
this scheme. All these bricks were to be made without straw; for the old
gentleman either could not, or would not, give his son a shilling, towards
laying a foundation for that fortune he was nevertheless sure he would one
day or other make. But having added the living languages to the dead ones, and
procured a recommendation for him to a counting∣house at Lisbon, they
parted: the father furnishing him with some excellent rules for the
regulation of his future conduct, and forbidding him to draw for any thing but
advice.</P>
<P>The young gentleman's temper happened luckily to fall in with
his father's. He undertook, if he were eligibly set out, to make his fortune.
His maxims were, from early youth, that if a man chose to fix his eye upon a
spot, let it be ever so out of his present reach, or surrounded by ever
such diffi∣culties, through perseverance it might be come at. In little, he
had proved this doctrine to be founded; for he never in his life
possessed, in his own right, a single sixpence, and yet he had cut
a figure with the best.</P>
<P>It is curious to remark, that though no man upon earth knew
better the value of substance than Mr. Gloss, yet he seem constantly
to live upon <PB N="118" REF="120"/> shadow. The appearance, and not the thing
itself, seemed to be what he most delighted in. He so com∣pletely
turned round all his employers in their own business, that the tide of
their fortune soon ran in a larger channel, and they were astonished at
the riches which originated from plans of his advising. They however little
considered what a yoke they were forming for themselves; for it was not
long before the young gentleman stipulated for a parti∣cipation of their
profits, in consequence of which he took the earliest opportunity to
involve the af∣fairs of the partnership, and was the only one able to save
any thing from the wreck of a bankruptcy, in which the whole concern was soon
involved.</P>
<P>After this stroke he went to Madeira, where he drew a picture
of the folly of his partners, and shewed very clearly—for it is
certainly true that people are to be reasoned into, as well as out of, any
thing—how unwisely they had acted, and how foolishly he had thrown
away his time.</P>
<P>Being, through a house with which he had been connected, very
soon taken in an active partner, for a slight share of the profits, and
with liberty to trade privately on his own account, he entered into the
spirit of the Madeira trade in such a style as astonish∣ed every
merchant on the island. He had the ad∣dress <PB N="119" REF="121"/> to tie
the Dunkirk dealers down to give him and his connections a preference in
brandies, pro∣vided they dealt to such an amount; in consequence of which
he soon had it in his power to stagnate the Dunkirk trade in Madeira, by
being able to un∣dersell the brandy merchants themselves, who, eager to
catch at the bait he held out for them, had sup∣plied him largely, little
suspecting he would hold back what he had bought, with a view of
forestalling their next market.</P>
<P>I give this as one among a variety of instances in which he
saw further into people's affairs than they did themselves. By this means
he had resources for them which they never dreamt of, and of course was
able to stipulate for better terms for himself.</P>
<P>In the mean time it was, one would think, this man's pride never
to have a shilling he could call his own. Nothing was expensive enough for
him, and when it was his turn to treat at Bachelor's-hall,—a place at
Madeira built by the unmarried men, and remarkable for hospitality—it
was in a style that astonished every body: for his taste was equal to
his ingenuity.</P>
<P>At length Madeira became too barren a spot for the fecundity
of his genius. He left it after giv∣ing <PB N="120" REF="122"/> it many real
advantages, and was universally regretted, as a man wonderfully calculated
for bu∣siness, and yet a most agreeable companion.</P>
<P>He got a considerable sum for his concern in the house he
left, which he took care, in a few months, to get rid of in England.</P>
<P>The reader remembers that this gentleman brought letters from
his connections in Madeira to Sir Sidney. These were of course greatly in
his fa∣vour. Indeed the baronet was very well disposed to shew him any
kindness; but it was among the maxims of Mr. Gloss never to make use of a
friend except to carry a material point, and a man must be very shallow
indeed if he could not pretty well guess beforehand whether that point could
be carried.</P>
<P>The plan upon which this young gentleman pro∣ceeded was very
simple, but it required consummate talents. It was nothing more than to
administer to every man's foibles, and reprobate his vices. It is
imppossible to describe how a man is infallibly taken hold of by a
conduct of this kind. Very few are uniformly good, or uniformly wicked;
therefore, all who are not have both follies and vices mixed with some good
qualities, Our follies are always agree∣able <PB N="121" REF="123"/> to us, but
though all vices are the consequence of them, we detest the vice itself,
while we hug the folly that may have caused it. Close however as we may
take folly to our hearts, we never fail to be privately ashamed of
ourselves for it, nor to at∣tribute, in the face of the world, our actions to
any thing else rather than this hidden cause. What power then must that
man have over you, who, by encouraging you in your foibles, not only has
dis∣covered this pleasurable deformity you are so studious to hide,
but, by glossing it over, contrives to make you believe it appears as
agreeable to him as to yourself. This man has your heart fully and wholly,
and there is nothing you can deny him.</P>
<P>This was Mr. Gloss, who, however he came by it, had this art
in the highest perfection, and knew so well how and upon whom to play his
game, that he was ever sure of coming off winner.</P>
<P>Nor are the talents which form this character of necessity
required to be very brilliant, though va∣rious and perspicuous. They are of
the minor kind: a quickness of conception, a close observation on men and
manners, some shrewdness, and a good memory comprising them all: to
which indeed—but that would be a deduction in worthy matters—
<PB N="122" REF="124"/> must be indispensibly added, frontless impudence
and a total want of feeling.</P>
<P>Any man with these in his possession, if he em∣ploy
himself in nothing but this pursuit, will ar∣rive to as great perfection in
the noble art of play∣ing upon mankind, as will raise him to that degree of
consequence he may think proper.</P>
<P>These qualifications stood with Mr. Gloss in the place of
Fortune, and with these he turned that fickle lady's wheel as he thought
proper.</P>
<P>Will not the reader begin to feel uncomfortable when, in
conformity to that veracity which all his∣torians should critically keep in
view, I am obliged to declare that this was the gentleman Mr. Stand∣fast had
in his eye as a husband for Annette.</P>
<P>Charles, Figgins, and Mr. Gloss were insepe∣rable. The
latter cut a prodigious figure. He had an elegant chariot, half a dozen
footmen, and might have been taken for a newly arrived nabob. It was an
extraordinary thing, however, that go where they would, though he was sure to
run up a most expensive reckoning, he, by some carelessness or
other, constantly left his purse at home, so that <PB N="123" REF="125"/>
he presently became indebted to Charles more than two hundred pounds in odds
and ends of this kind.</P>
<P>This passed off as eccentricity, and as he had a most
agreeable apparent indolence of mind, which, by the way, was what Kiddy would
have called a copy of his countenance, he appeared to our hero the most
delightful companion he had ever met with.</P>
<P>It was agreed that Charles, with Figgins as a companion,
should, early in the spring, set out to make a tour of Europe, in which
he ventured to express a very strong wish that Mr. Gloss would
accompany him.</P>
<P>This however could not be. That gentleman was in treaty for a
borough, which a member was expected every day to vacate in his favour.
Be∣sides, he had requested Sir Sidney to cheapen an estate for him in
Warwickshire, and he was cursed∣ly afraid that a certain woman of
condition, that he said should be nameless—and so she well
might, for she was not in existence—would insist upon a kind of a
half promise he had made, and noose him; which matter, he said, were it
really serious, he verily believed would drive him abroad; for he did 
<PB N="124" REF="126"/> not think the possession of the finest and
richest wo∣man in the kingdom a compensation for the loss of any man's
liberty of his figure and consequence.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>CONSISTING OF ADVICE AND AN ADIEU TO ENGLAND.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE spring put an end to those town enjoyments which had
employed the leisure hours of our hero and his connections, and now Charles
and his friend Figgins began to prepare for an excursion to those parts of
the world where true politeness is thought to be native, so heartily do
Englishmen reprobate the manners of their own country, though they so
dearly love its principles.</P>
<P>It was settled that our hero should go on to Italy, by the
borders of Flanders, and not see Paris till on his return to England, through
the heart of France; as it was thought, by that means, he would the better
taste the pleasures of that capital.</P>
<P>Charles's heart was fully set on this tour, and, for several
days, it was the general topic of all the friends. He received the good
wishes and advice of all with great thankfulness. Sir Sidney, with 
<PB N="126" REF="128"/> the heartiest friendship, entreated him not to
en∣graft French manners upon an English cion. He begged of him to hear,
see, and consider; to ap∣prove and adopt whatever mended the heart, but to
reject with contempt all that merely went to deco∣rate the person. He said
a flattering exterior was a dangerous thing, and there were sometimes more
art and design under a feather, than any graver de∣coration of the head. He
said the whole character of the French was comprehended in minutiae; that
this rendered them at first sight agreeable, after∣wards necessary, and
at length, to credulous men, endearing, but to the penetrating trifling and
tire∣some.</P>
<P>Sir Sidney said he would not wish for a better authority for
pronouncing a man weak and igno∣rant than his having a strong attachment,
upon re∣peated trials, to the French in general. They were, he said, polite
without good manners; acquainted with every thing, though perfect in nothing;
pray∣ing one moment and cheating the next; holding you in their arms, and
laughing over your shoulder; gay with design; accommodating with arrogance;
apparently open, but really hypocritical; assuming with meanness. In
short, he said their lives were a mixture of pride and servility;
self-consequence and adulation; stateliness and cringing;
protesta∣tion <PB N="127" REF="129"/> and insincerity; and though their
sports were the sports of children, their mischief was the mis∣chief of
monkies.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Happy the man then, sir,' said Charles,
'who, like you, can sensibly discriminate between the extremes of this
motley character, and retain so much of it for his own use as shall make
him wary in his dealings with the world, without being
dishonourable.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'I know not,' said Sir Sidney, 'whether I
de∣serve your compliment, but this is the very effect I would wish the
French manners to have upon you, who, however cautioned, will, I fear, from the
openness of your heart, and your strong de∣sire to find men what they
ought to be, take, without examination, that dross which the French so very
easily contrive to pass for sterling. As to Italy, see every valuable
picture, statue, and struc∣ture; hear all that is excellent in music,
admire the country, and come away, lest, exclusive of the danger to your
own morals, you are obliged to con∣fess that the most beautiful, and once
the most glo∣rious, place in the world, is now the most infamous.'</Q></P>
<P>Lady Roebuck, who truly regarded Charles as her son, as much
from inclination as from a promise <PB N="128" REF="130"/> made to Lady Hazard
on her death bed, gave him only general advice as to his youth and
inexperience, relying however on his strong good sense, and that
rectitude of heart which, as we have already noticed, was remarkable in so
young a man. She promised to keep Annette firmly to her sentiments of
esteem for him, and doubted not but his conduct would warrant all her
exertions in the promotion of his happiness; and finally, that Annette
improved at home, and he abroad, there could be no doubt of their making one of
the most happy, as well as ele∣gant couples in the world.</P>
<P>Emma warned him against the jays of France and the
nightingales of Italy. She said she foresaw that, if his heart was not
steel and adamant, he would be ruined; that she had read his mind
thoroughly, and plainly saw that the only vice he had in the world was want
of deceit. It was, to be sure, a strange declaration, but it was very true.
That she should not wonder at any thing he became in the hands of the
French and Italians; for he was such pliable wax that any man, with a
plausible story, the argu∣ment of which could be deduced from a good
mo∣tive, might shape him into any form. She begged of him, in particular, to
beware of holy hypocrites. What she had read, she told him, of their
cruelty and dissoluteness, was yet worse, if possible, than all 
<PB N="129" REF="131"/> the gambols with which the forms of their facetious
religion seemed to burlesque its author: or rather, the author of that
which they daringly ventured to innovate, and which involved a system of
morality mild as mercy, and benignant as his holy name who established it.
Above all she cautioned him against convents, and an intercourse with
those drones of society the inmates of them, who, from leisure to plan,
and inclination to execute, were the perpe∣trators of every species of
profligacy and mischief. Her reading, she said, had induced her to
believe that there were more than three hundred thousand cloystered clergy
in France, and a proportionable number of females; that the wickedness, the
attro∣cious wickedness carried on within those walls, which were
supposed to immure saints, was shock∣to humanity.</P>
<P>Emma further observed that it could not be sup∣posed that
any thing like the licentious infamy of France and Italy could ever have been
practised here, because England had, properly speaking, never been the
seat of that dangerous religion; but let it be recollected, in the reign of
Henry the Eighth, what barbarous, what detestable vestiges of popish
profligacy were discovered at the demo∣lishing Netley abbey, and many other
convents.—Subterraneous communications for nightly visits 
<PB N="130" REF="132"/> from friars to nuns, and nuns to friars. Hidden infants
apparently murdered. If then the plant, which was here an exotic, grew to
such perfection, how must it flourish in its native soil. It was
hor∣rible to think of it!</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'But,' added Emma, if I may credit what I have
read, this most unholy, irreverent, indecent, ri∣diculous religion, is
clearly where it exists a jest with all but the superstitious ignorant.
What is the mode of choosing a pope but a blasphemous imposition, in
which, one would think, to punish them for presumptuously daring to give
out that their election is from heaven, they once, by in∣spiration no doubt,
as well as upon all other oc∣casions, chose a woman, who betrayed her
sex, their shame, and opened the eyes of every one who chose to see.
But <HI>vive la bagatelle</HI> in that, as in every thing else, soon got
the better of good sense and sound reason, and they went on electing
popes, the choice of heaven; not however with∣out taking a precaution, lest
heaven should have again deceived them.'</Q></P>
<P>Emma's precautions were applauded by a burst of laughter, and
Charles entreated her to make herself perfectly easy, giving her his word
that he would take particular care that his small plan∣tation 
<PB N="131" REF="133"/> of understanding should not be eaten up by these
black locusts.</P>
<P>Annette took an innocent but tender leave of her lover; for Emma
had ever encouraged her not to be ashamed of a truly virtuous passion.
Our hero felt himself greatly charmed at the distinction, and exulted not a
little at reflecting that after time and experience should have prepared him
with manly and proper resolutions, and given him riper quali∣ties of mind and
person, the possession of so charm∣ing an object would be within
his reach. Many were their mutual protestations: ardent, yet inno∣cent;
heartfelt, yet reasonable. At length they separated, with a promise to
write to each other, and with vows of inviolable fidelity.</P>
<P>One audience now only stood with Lord Hazard, before the time
when our hero was to depart. This interview was without witness. My lord took
his son tenderly by the hand, saying, 
<Q REND="inline">'My dear Charles, lowered as I am by my grief,
wretched by calamity, and disordered by both, my merits are more than
rewarded by having you for my son. I never made you a stranger to my
youthful excesses; indeed it would perhaps be policy to paint them to you
even in their strongest colours, that you might shun the certain ruin
that awaits <PB N="132" REF="134"/> such profligacy. Your incomparable mother,
now no more, was—I cannot think of it but my soul is in
arms—given me to bless my repentant heart with comfort more than such
a wretch de∣served; yet did I, after the enjoyment of such bliss, such
unexampled delight, dash the cup of happiness from my lips, in the very
moment that it held for me all the blessings of life in one deli∣cious
draught.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Wonder not at my words, Charles, it is very
true; your mother owes her death to me!—to your father!—to your
wretched culpable father! He who should from duty, from gratitude, from a
sense of his own honour, her virtues, her an∣gelic virtues, have avoided
like contagion the most distant means that could wound her mind the
thousandth part of a moment, much less join with wretches, with infamous
detestable wretches, to work the destruction of her peace, and then her
life! Oh look with pity,' cried he, in agony, injured, martyred saint, and
calm the woes that tear me!—that destroy me!—that feed me with
such torturing remorse as would make me think annihilation a blessing!
My dear boy thou art astonished.'—</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'I am indeed sir,' said Charles; 'but it
cannot <PB N="133" REF="135"/> be; I know sir it is impossible. The fixed,
the solemn melancholy with which my indeed incom∣parable mother's death has
shaded your brow, makes you see every thing through a sadly deceit∣ful
medium, and you think the irregularities of your youth sat near her heart.
But cheer away this melancloly, my lord and father: let me fore∣go my intention
of travelling, and stay to comfort you by my watchful and tender duty. I will
swear to have no joy, no employment, but the dear pleasing task of
exhausting all my little talents to divert and soften your
anxiety.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'My good, my noble boy,' said Lord Hazard, I
cannot now enjoy a single glimpse of happiness but that which results
from reflecting how great, how illustrious a figure you will one day make. My
heart is set on your travelling, and the letters I shall receive from you
will be all my comfort. As for the rest, time and reflection, sweeted by
the friendship of Sir Sidney, may restore my health—which I will
endeavour to preserve for thy sake—but nothing can give me back my
peace of mind. This unhappy business, which was not a youthful folly, but a
relapse of honour:—Poor boy, I little thought, when I was schooling
thee, how much I stood in need of a tutor myself. But my words, like my
deeds, want connection. I <PB N="134" REF="136"/> was going to say I would
relate this damned busi∣ness to you by letter, with reflections; the whole
of which together may serve you for an excellent system of advice, for it
will have both honest pre∣cept and dreadful example in one.'</Q></P>
<P>Charles acceeded to the terms, and pledged him∣self before
hand, so well he said he knew his fa∣ther's excellent heart, that in
discussing this busi∣ness, be it what it might, the guilt would
vanish, though the cala<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ity
should remain.</P>
<P>My <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> thanking his
son for this earnest of his tender
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ty, proceeded in more tranquillity
to tell him the state of his expectations.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Heaven knows, my dear, my worthy boy,' said
he, 'that it would be the pride of my life could I leave you my her<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ditary estate and honours, but they
are so rigidly tied up, that it is impossible. All you can have therefore
is your mother's join∣ture, amounting to about fifteen hundred a year, and what
ready money I may die possessed of, which I hope will realize for you
an annuity equal to that amount: and with this fortune I know Sir Sidney will
be content to take you for his son in
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>. Your income till you are of
age will be a thousand a year: spend this freely; I give you 
<PB N="135" REF="137"/> leave; but do not spend a shilling more. If I
should die before you return—'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Far be that unhappy day,' said Charles. 'Come
sir, take leave of melancholy reflections; I shall not else have the
heart to leave you. Indeed I can hardly bear the thought at any rate. Warm as
my youthful imagination paints the various pleasures of different courts and
nations, I should be wretched in the midst of them all, and alone though in
a throng, if I thought, in my absence, my father indulged a single sigh
that my presence could suppress.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Noble boy,' said Lord Hazard, 'charming
youth, adieu: your kind words shall serve me for consolation till I have
your first letter; your first letter till I have your second; and thus
you see pleasure will accumulate with me—and every post
too—for by every post I hope you will write.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'I will indeed, my dear father,' said Charles,
'but let me not go while you are thus uneasy. I feel a reluctance, an
unspeakable reluctance to leave you. There is an inquietude hangs over me
that I can∣not describe.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'It is nothing, my kind boy,' said his father,
'but the damp I have thrown on your spirits; my letters however will
dissipate it. I have ever wanted to open my heart to you, for 
<PB N="136" REF="138"/> I wish to think you as much a friend as a
son.—Do then, by the most tender, the most endearing
expressions, in both qualities, hearten me to live to be happy, to make
thee so; thee, my good boy, my only remaining comfort!'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Doubt not my whole power, my whole devotion,'
said Charles. 'Be assured there is no pursuit upon earth that I shall
not consider as secondary to my duty to the best of fathers.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'And now Charles,' said my lord, 'almost the
happiestof fathers, since I see I shall derive so much pleasure
from thee.'</Q></P>
<P>A servant now informed them the chaise was ready. A few more
reciprocal promises of attention passed, after which they joined the
company, to every individual of which Charles bid a tender adieu; till at
length, having embraced his father with uncommon emotion, he burst into a
flood of tears, hurried with Figgins to the chaise, and had got twenty miles
before he once opened his mouth.</P>

<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAPTER I.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>CONSISTING OF POLITENESS, A TRIP TO CALAIS, AND A CU∣RIOUS
DISCOVERY.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>EVERY thing Mr. Figgins had done hitherto was rather a partial
rehearsal behind the scenes than the actual performance of his part. He now
comes forward on the stage, where we dare trust him with∣out a prompter,
so well had he perfected himself in those scenes where he was
destined to make his appearance: and indeed it were to be wished that other
actors, whether on the theatre or in the pul∣pit, at the bar, at court, or any
of those many playhouses in the kingdom, were—though but for the
sake of consistency—half so well qualified to sustain their
parts, or half so perfect in them.</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="140"/> Charles had not twice changed horses in
his way to Dover before he had much welcome cause to be charmed with the
solicitude of his friend. Figgins well knew that to treat a disorder in the
mind, he must have recourse to a practice the very reverse of that
generally adopted with relation to the body; therefore, instead of
nauseous, unpalatable draughts, in which one would think its professors
imagined consist all the secrets of physic, he studiously went
about to prepare all that he conceived would charm the heart and expand the
liberal mind of our hero. He drew him from his silence by degrees; extolled
in the highest terms of admiration his filial piety; represented the
condition of his father as the work∣ings of a truly amiable mind, formerly
irregular indeed, but now restored to the exercises of reason and
benevolence; he drew a warm picture of both the power and the will of Sir
Sidney to sooth all his cares; and finally, painted the extreme
satisfaction that would result to him by a contemplation that he had one
son who would become so great an honour to him as to make noble amends for
the obloquy cast upon his name by the despicable ignorance and
con∣temptible conduct of the other.</P>
<P>After several similar preparations, he began to enter upon
the grand subject, and at length made his young friend perfectly sensible
for what purpose <PB N="139" REF="141"/> they were then in the post
chaise. France and all its gaieties began insensibly to blend in their
con∣versation, and Figgins archly remarked that gravity was an exotic which
certainly would not flourish in so smiling a climate.</P>
<P>Charles was ever remarkably tenacious of not permitting his
private feelings to inconvenience his friends, and the less he conceived
himself obliged to restraint by a man's presence, the more forward he was
to shew that his attention was voluntary.—He felt Figgins's kindness,
and began to unbend. Besides, he had high health, and brilliant spirits;
and however sincerely he might grieve at heart when he reflected—which
he certainly very often did for his time of life—sorrow caught but
little apparent hold on his volatile mind.</P>
<P>Being arrived at Dover, they bespoke a passage boat to
themselves for the next morning, and while it was yet day-light took a walk
to see that cliff which Emma had convinced herself, by her read∣ing, though
now the boundary of the channel, had certainly, in former times, made a part of
the con∣tinent.</P>
<P>On their return to supper, the landlady informed them that a
young lady, attended by a footman and <PB N="140" REF="142"/> a female
servant, had arrived since their departure, and finding that our travellers
had engaged the only passage boat on the Dover side, expressed an
anxious wish that she might be permitted to go half the expence of the
vessel, and sail with that opportu∣nity, for that her affairs called for
expedition; and she had been also informed that as the wind blew right into
Calais harbour there would be no chance of any arrival from thence.</P>
<P>It will easily be conceived that the request was instantly
complied with, though not the terms of it. A genteel compliment was instantly
returned to the lady, with an earnest entreaty that she would suffer the
gentlemen to wait on her. The interview was permitted, the lady was
complimented with the offer of a passage for her and her servants, which
it was delicately hinted to her must be gratis, and, after as much
hesitation as was due to good breed∣ing, she accepted the proposal.</P>
<P>What Figgins had so successfully began, this lady
completed. She was young, handsome, and lively, and though there appeared now
and then a little levity in her manner, yet Charles, upon Figgins's
suggestion, was willing to attribute it to her extrac∣tion and situation,
the first of which they soon <PB N="141" REF="143"/> learnt from her own
mouth was French, and the latter that of a widow.</P>
<P>In the course of their conversation, it came out, to the
great satisfaction of our travellers, that this young lady, by name St.
Vivier, was born in En∣gland, and the daughter of a French refugee; that she
married a French gentleman, who was pro∣scribed for some overt acts in
which he stood up for the liberty of the subject, but he now being dead,
she was going to see what she could collect in France of the scattered
remains of his fortune; that her journey was to Lyons, and being obliged to
make some stay at Sedan, for intelligence among her late husband's
relations, she should pursue her rout by the borders of Flanders.</P>
<P>As this was step for step the way that had been marked out
for Charles, what could be so fortunate as the above intelligence. This fact
was commu∣nicated, and a proposal suggested that they should make that
tour together. It was not however men∣tioned but with the most suitable
propriety as to preparation and manner. The lady found great difficulty to
believe that her route was really that which our travellers had intended to
take, but saw, she said, that they were so polite as to alter their
intention in compliment to her.</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="144"/> Both Charles and Figgins vehemently
protested the truth of their assertion, and indeed used so many
arguments to convince her that it would have been an infringment of that
politeness which she seemed to possess in a natural and elegant
degree to have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urther doubted their
veracity. The next difficulty was that it would appear very odd if she
should travel in the company of strangers. Charles said she had her own
servants with her, and Figgins noticed that they were all alike strangers
in France, where indeed no explanations were ever required when people paid
their way. This she said she should make a point of doing to the
utmost farthing, if she consented at all, but at any rate she must
en∣treat till the morning to consider of the propriety of their proposal, 
<Q REND="inline">'for,' added she, 'a woman of ho∣nour cannot
be too cautious, especially in such a licentious country as France has been
described to me.'</Q></P>
<P>In this remark both our hero and his friend ac∣quiesced, and
now supper being announced, the lady, after some little difficulty, was
prevailed on to partake of it; not however without remarking that matters
must be put upon a different footing when they should arrive on the other
side of the wa∣ter. To which our hero replied, with a very pe∣netrating
glance, that he sincerely hoped it would <PB N="143" REF="145"/> be so, and,
upon the lady's looking grave, added, since it appeared to be her wish.</P>
<P>A smart breeze the next day conducted them safely to Calais
in something more than three hours, where, after the customary ceremonies
of entering their names, paying a visit to the custom-house, giving
something in charity, and satisfying a few clamorous porters, they were
glad to get hold of some <HI>soup gras</HI> at Desseins, which, as well
as the rest of their dinner, they found excellent.</P>
<P>In the evening they went to the play, which was also performed
in the same inn, where there is a remarkable neat theatre, and by no means
small. During the performance Charles was greatly pleased with the remarks
of Madame St. Vivire, who spoke French admirably well, and perfectly tasted
the neat nothingness of the French little operas, two of which were that
night given. Our hero, who knew also that language as well as reading could
teach it him, begged to be this lady's scholar for the prac∣tical part of it.
She readily agreed, by which means, as he feigned, whenever he found it
con∣venient, to know less than he did, he had a thou∣sand opportunities of
indulging himself in a thou∣sand witty sallies, by way of trying how a
declara∣tion of love would be taken, which he the less he∣sitated 
<PB N="144" REF="146"/> to do, as a widow at her own disposal was fairly out
of his agreement.</P>
<P>He first tried his French eloquence to persuade her that the
pleasure of her charming company and the advantage of the rapid improvement
he should make under her tuition would amply overbalance the expences of
their journey. At first however she could not think of consenting to
this, but Charles being strongly seconded by Figgins, she at length
agreed.</P>
<P>This matter set Charles more at ease, for he was pretty well
assured she could not be a woman of very nice honour who would, in this
instance, yield to the solicitation of two strangers. He there∣fore
determined to ply her with the whole force of his amorous eloquence. At night
he took notice she sipped the burgundy pretty freely, which op∣portunity he
seized to insinuate some bold hints which were not ill received.
Maintaining this ground, he had soon reason to think the lady would, after
a very short siege, surrender in form, which hopes were confirmed the
next morning by Figgins, who had already won the lady's woman—both a
handsome and genteel girl—and reaped the fruits of his victory.</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="147"/> Charles redoubled his assiduity, and
Madam St. Vivier, after holding out with great apparent mo∣desty, at length
reluctantly promised to make him happy on their arrival at Lisle, to which
place, having seen every thing at Calais, not forgetting the picture where
the citizens are kneeling to King Edward, with halters about their necks, which
curiosity was recommended to his attention by Emma, they now prepared to
set out.</P>
<P>About an hour before the horses were to be ready, Mr.
Dessein begged the favour of an au∣dience with Charles, which being granted
him, after a proper apology and preparation, he said he had a matter of great
delicacy to communicate, which concerned him nearly.</P>
<P>Charles expressed some surprise at this declara∣tion,
and having previously promised at Dessein's entreaty, that he would in
no wise take the matter ill, he was informed that, some months before, a
gentleman came to him one morning, saying, 
<Q REND="inline">'Mr. Dessein I have been robbed of those
eighty <HI>louis d'ors</HI> which I yesterday received from you in a
bag.'</Q> He replied it was impossible; that his money might probably be
mislaid, or found by the servants, but that in that house nobody could be
<PB N="146" REF="148"/> robbed. He would make enquiry, he said, and the money
would be restored to him.</P>
<P>The gentleman went out, and at his return Dessein had eighty
<HI>louis d'ors</HI> ready for him in a bag similar to the other, for money
being in France often paid in three livre and six livre pieces, the bankers
have all bags on purpose.</P>
<P>The excuse made to the gentleman was, that, as the house was
very full the evening before, the ser∣vant, after he was asleep, seeing
the bag lie on the ground, had brought it to one of the clerks, who had put it
in the counting house; for it should be known that Dessein is a banker
as well as an inn∣keeper. The gentleman, not in the least suspect∣ing the
truth of what he heard, put the money in his pocket, and went away.</P>
<P>The fact, however, which had been so artfully
suppressed, was this: Dessein said he saw in a mo∣ment that the
gentleman had been really robbed, and upon making his enquiries, as to the
situation of the lodgers, he found to a certainty by whom. In short, he
said, this crime was committed by a young English gentleman, heir to a high
title, and a large estate; that it could not be for want of mo∣ney, 
<PB N="147" REF="149"/> as, no doubt, he might have had what he pleased of his
father; but finding himself in an immediate necessity, instead of
applying to him, in which case he might have been supplied, he took this
sum without considering the consequences.</P>
<P>Mr. Dessein said the resolution he took upon it was to
say nothing upon the subject to any person till he should see the
young gentleman himself, for that out of gratitude to the English, to whom
he owed his all, he would rather lose ten times that sum than make a stir
about such a trifle, but that having seen that young gentleman since, and
been treated by him in a very <HI>en cavalier</HI> style, though he was
determined not to expose him, except to his own family, he should now
certainly make no scruple of applying for the money.</P>
<P>In short, he informed our hero, who began now to smell a
rat, that Zekiel was the thief.</P>
<P>What an opportunity is here to put an end to this history!
Charles had nothing to do but get his brother hanged, to be heir to the family,
title, and estate, his marriage with Annette would have fol∣lowed of
course, and when they had produced half <PB N="148" REF="150"/> a dozen
children, for Lord Hazard to dandle on his knee, and comfort himself in his
old age, he would have sunk peaceably to rest, and have left his darling
son and daughter in possession of his ho∣nours.</P>
<P>Whether Charles foresaw an uniform tranquil∣lity in such a
life, and was determined to experi∣ence what sort of pleasures are
generally produced by variety, or whether—which is full as
proba∣ble—he felt a strong wish to hide his unnatural brother's
frailty, we will not enquire. Certain it is, he, without hesitation, repaid
Mr. Dessein upon the spot, thanked him for his prudence, and
re∣presented that he was sorry to see his brother pos∣sessed so
insolent a spirit, but begged he would consider the whole as an
extravagant <HI>tour de jeunesse,</HI> which had more of false wit in it
than premedi∣tated vice. He desired that the whole might sink into
oblivion, and in particular that it might never come to his father's ears.</P>
<P>Mr. Dessein promised literally to follow the di∣rections
of our hero, with whose manner and ge∣nerosity he was very much struck;
and could not help remarking that he plainly saw, though 
<PB N="149" REF="151"/> the honour was vested in the elder brother, the
younger possessed the virtues which could alone enoble a family.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>STRANGE ADVENTURES AT AN INN—BEING THE HALF-WAY HOUSE
THROUGH THIS LITERARY JOURNEY.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>CHARLES having finished this business greatly to his
satisfaction, determined that no hint should es∣cape him concerning it,
not even to Figgins; but, lest future instances of his brother's nefarious
con∣duct should multiply in a strange country, where it would cost him
dearly to extricate himself from such difficulties, he lengthened a letter
he had al∣ready written to his father, by first very delicately apologizing
for touching on such a subject, and then entreating that his brother's
allowance might be augmented, even though his own should be curtailed; for
that it was impossible for a man in any style to cut a figure in
France—particularly a young and inexperienced man—with a slender
in∣come. He gave some general reasons for this re∣quest, and, though with
great deference, strongly submitted the matter to his father's
considera∣tion.</P>
<P><PB N="151" REF="153"/> After entreating Mr. Dessein to
send any letters forward for him to Lisle, he took leave of Calais.</P>
<P>At Lisle they purposed staying a few days, and as Charles
promised himself the possession of Ma∣dame St. Vivier, he was
determined to sport as grand a figure as his circumstances would
allow.—He therefore hired a carriage, made parties, and gave <HI>petits
soupees</HI> at his inn, which were of course frequented by as many
guests, particularly officers and abbes, as could beg, borrow, or steal
cards of invitation.</P>
<P>One evening, about half an hour before supper, arrived <HI>un
My Lor Anglois,</HI> with a gentleman and lady, two footmen and a maid
servant, who could not get so elegant a repast as they wished, all the
delicacies being taken up by our hero, who had in∣vited a large party by way of
adieu to Lisle.—Charles, when he came to understand the
inconve∣nience of the strangers, of which he had been in∣nocently the
cause, upon consulting Figgins, sent his compliments and requested as a
favour that they would add <HI>sans facons</HI> to the number of those he
had invited.</P>
<P>The invitation was as freely accepted as given, the two
gentlemen and the lady presently appeared, <PB N="152" REF="154"/> and were
received with all that freedom so com∣mon in France. The lady was immediately
sur∣rounded by the officers, and the gentlemen, who appeared to be true
English sportsmen, were hunt∣ing out for any body who could speak a
word of English. Figgins and our hero relieved their distress as much as
possible. At length supper appeared, and presently one of our bucks
said to the other, 
<Q REND="inline">'I say, you Tadpole, if I can think how so
many people jabber so curse confoundedly with their jaws full.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Oh, my lord,' said his friend, 'a Frenchman's
jaws are like the tools of a trunk maker, they always make more noise than
work.'</Q></P>
<P>Figgins gave them a hint that they had better be on their guard,
lest any of the company should un∣derstand English.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Oh dam'me,' said my lord, 'the queer lantern
jawed bitches of fellows know no more about English than they do about
roast beef: only see if they do. Mounseer!'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'<HI>Monsieur,</HI>' answered a very polite
abbe.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'I say,' said my lord, 'Moun∣seer, how
much soup meeger and frogs do you hide away, when you can get it, in your
leather bags of cheeks, that look for all the world like the jaw bags of a
monkey?'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="155"/> The abbe, after paying him the utmost
attention, replied, 
<Q REND="inline">'<HI>Monsieur, je ne comprend pas un
mot.</HI>'—</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Now what the devil,' faid my lord, 'is <HI>paws
umo?</HI>'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'He fays he does not understand what you
say,' answered Figgins; 'but you see how open you are yourself, for
what he said might have been abuse for ought you knew to the
con∣trary.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Come sir,' said my lord, 'no offence to
you, but I will bet you five hundred, and I say done first, that if any
French rascal in company dares for to offer an affront to me, I twigs him a
lick of the jaws.'</Q></P>
<P> At this moment Madam St. Vivier said 
<Q REND="inline">'My Lord Hazard I have the pleasure of
drinking your health.'</Q> To which Charles answered, 
<Q REND="inline">'My dear Madam I thank you; give me leave to
drink with you, that our wishes may be mutual.'</Q></P>
<P> The stranger, who was disputing with Figgins, here cried
out, 
<Q REND="inline">'Hey! what's this! Here you Tad∣pole, how is
this? Here is a gentleman does me the honour to take up my title before I am
dead, ay and before my old put of a father is dead too!'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="156"/> Charles, penetrating in a moment the
whole force of these few words, blushed with indignation, which Zekiel
perceiving—for the reader sees it was he—followed the blow he had
given, by saying 
<Q REND="inline">'Ay, dam'me, fine work; fine times, when every
little whipper snapper can set up for a lord!'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'True,' said Figgins, who had a mind to give
our he∣ro time for recollection, 'and one may see by your own appearance how
contemptible it is,'—</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Nay,' said Mr. Tadpole, 'you must now
suffer me to speak sir. This gentleman is certainly the eldest son of
Lord Hazard, who has ridiculously discarded him under pretence of libertine
conduct, when there is scarcely such an old libertine as himself in
existence.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Sir,' said Charles, 'your assertion is a
falsity. I see this whole business. I am by accident in the company of
my elder brother, who shall not, nor shall you sir, traduce the character
of the most amiable father that ever had existence.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Come, come,' said Figgins, 'let the matter,
now it is explained, be, as it ought, forgotton; or at least defer it all the
company is gone, or till to-mor∣row morning.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'I defer it!' said the young lord;</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'no such thing I assure you:—who's
afraid of these grinning ba∣boons <PB N="155" REF="157"/> here?'</Q> for the
Frenchmen had by this time began to shrug up their shoulders, and
demonstrate other tokens of admiration. 
<Q REND="inline">'My brother Charles here, for that is the go I
see, thinks, because he has got a parcel of starve-gutted rips of
moun∣seers about him, that a man of my condition, dam'me, is to be grinned
out of his title.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'When the title comes to be yours,' retorted
Charles, 'there will be more likelihood of grinning than at present; but the
matter, as Mr. Figgins has very properly said, should drop, which you had
better agree to yourself, at least for the pre∣sent, if it were only in
consideration of your being my guest.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Your guest!' said Zekiel, 'why do you think
as I would have come for to eat any of your sup∣per if I had been up to
such fine gig as this?'—</Q>
<Q REND="inline">'As much,' said Charles, as I would have
invited you, had I known who you were:—as the invita∣tion therefore was
sent as from stranger to stran∣ger, I am willing to give it another turn
to all those who have not understood the dispute, and I am sure the
whole company will join in laughing it off.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Yes, and a fine laugh it would be against me,
<PB N="156" REF="158"/> hey Tadpole. No, no, dam'me, I will tell them all about
it. I say, Mounseer, no my lord he—I my lord.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'<HI>Ah ha!</HI>' said an officer, without
understanding him.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Dam'me if I ever saw such a set of fools
in my life,' said Zekiel.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'That man no my lord at all; I am one great,
grand my lord myself!'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Very great and very grand indeed,' said
Charles; 'it is pity that nobody knows it.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'You are a puppy, Mr. Charles,' said Zekiel:
why the devil don't you help me out, Tadpole? you can jabber a little of their
damned gib∣berish.'</Q></P>
<P>Tadpole undertook to inform the company how the matter stood,
in which account he certainly be∣haved very scandalously, by representing
Zekiel as a lord, and Charles as an impostor, without ex∣plaining how
innocently the matter had been fallen into. Here Charles interfered with all
the warmth he could. It was however to no purpose. <HI>Cest affreux! Jesu
Maria! Cest honteux!</HI> and half a dozen other expressions of
astonishment, were all uttered together, and the whole company agreed that
they had all along feared our hero was a low born fellow by his prodigality. In
short, a thousand marks of <PB N="157" REF="159"/> attention were
immediately lavished upon Zekiel, which being interpreted to him through the
me∣dium of Tadpole, he swore he never liked French people so well in his
life, while Charles, fortified by indignation against the apostacy of his
guests, did not now think it worth his while to undeceive them, but contented
himself with taking this as a caution how he should summon together a
promis∣cuous company in France at his own expence for the future.</P>
<P>Figgins however was determined it should not go off so. He
observed that not one of the company, while they bestowed pretty liberally
the most humi∣liating epithets on Charles, grudged to eat or drink any thing
they could lay their hands on, he there∣fore moved that either nothing should
be touched, or that they would accompany every word, in the manner they had
before this discovery, with some well-turned compliment to him at whose
expence they sat down; for as nothing was expected for so sumptuous an
entertainment but words—a coin in which they were very rich and very
prodigal—he must beg, in the name of his friend, that they would fulfil
the conditions of the feast, otherwise it would induce him to wish for a
bill, that every man might pay his reckoning in another coin, with 
<PB N="158" REF="160"/> which he did not believe they were so well
pro∣vided.</P>
<P>This sarcasm gave very high offence, notwith∣standing
which they eat and drank on without offer∣ing to comply with either of Mr.
Figgins's condi∣tions, till at last Zekiel, to whom they were ex∣plained
through Tadpole, offered to pay his share, and invited his new friends to
follow his ex∣ample.</P>
<P>His adherents began now to forsake him; no one came into his
proposal, and all eyes were imme∣diately fixed again upon Charles, who
seeing what sort of turn matters were likely to take, got up, and said, 
<Q REND="inline">'Come gentlemen, I will end the
dispute:—Is it not fair that he should be considered as the true
Lord Hazard who pays the bill?'</Q></P>
<P>A general affirmative was instantly given, and Zekiel being
asked if he would pay the whole ex∣pence of the evening out of his pocket,
answered he would see such a set of mounseers and madames at the
devil first. Charles then called the waiter, who said there was nothing to
pay, for that his honour had satisfied every thing, as well for the supper
as the dance and little opera that would enter in a few minutes.</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="161"/> Zekiel now under went a thousand
mortifications, which he contented himself with returning by a∣buse, in a
language the Frenchmen could not un∣derstand. At length he sneaked off to
bed, vowing revenge against his brother, which Mr. Flush, who, as we have
said, was a follower of his fortunes, assured him, as he ascended the
gallery, was easily practicable.</P>
<P>I have already said Charles had reason to believe that
Madame St. Vivier would at Lisle recompense his attention, by consenting
to make him happy upon his own terms. That very night shew was to comply with
his wishes, and this secret, by a means I shall take an opportunity one
time or other to ex∣plain, Mr. Flush had discovered, and now im∣parted it
to Zekiel, who getting instructions as to the situation of all the
different bed-chambers, de∣termined to supplant his brother.</P>
<P>In pursuance of this determination, when all was silent in
the inn, he went to the room where he had been directed, and finding it
invitingly open, fastened the door on the inside, and groped about till he
found the bed. Being accosted by a female voice, in a whisper, he replied
in the same man∣ner. He then undrest himself, and was welcomed into bed
as warmly as he could wish. In about <PB N="160" REF="162"/> half an hour
after, another person knocked softly at the door, whom he of course
guessed to be his brother Charles; but, advising the lady not to take the
smallest notice of this intrusion, after a short time the importunate
visitant gave over knocking, and went away.</P>
<P>He began now to glory in his success, and had a great mind
to stay and brazen the whole matter out, but was so earnestly entreated
by the lady to spare her delicacy, and to leave her before the day dawned,
that he at length complied.</P>
<P>Elated with this revenge, Zekiel, as he occa∣sionally
passed our hero in the morning, could not help looking big, and half
insulting him. Charles bore every thing very patiently, till, being obliged
to answer an impertinent question or two, a very provoking altercation
ensued, and Zekiel ventured a most invidious and wanton invective against
the memory of Charles's mother. Scarcely were the words out of his mouth, when
our hero fairly knocked him down, and indeed was so transported with
passion, that he swore he would not rest a mo∣ment till he had
sacrificed so infamous a rascal to the offended laws.</P>
<P>Zekiel being again upon his legs, came up and 
<PB N="161" REF="163"/> demanded what he meant by that. Charles bid him ask
Monsieur Dessein. At these words Zekiel was in a cold sweat, and
trembled from head to foot, and was actually upon the point of confessing
the robbery when Figgins and Mr. Tadpole came up-Seeing this, Charles, in the
language of Tamerlane, bade him keep his own wicked secret, and be safe;
and asking Mr. Tadpole which way they intended to go to England, and being
answered by the way of Ostend, he advised him, for the sake of his
friend, to keep that resolution.</P>
<P>Figgins plainly saw there was some hidden mean∣ing in this
expression, and had indeed, though he had not betrayed it, thought a little
mysteriously of the <HI>tete a tete</HI> interview between Charles and
Mon∣sieur Dessein; to which another circumstance that occurred at
Lisle being added, he thought it neces∣sary to tax Charles with want of
confidence, and pushing the matter while it was warm, he obtained from our
hero, who was the worst qualified in the world for a hypocrite, the whole
truth.</P>
<P>Figgins thanked him for his frankness, and said that in
return he would give him some intelligence relative to Master Zekiel that
would not a little sur∣prise him.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="164"/> He said, that being all well flushed
the night be∣fore, every one seemed to have his different appoint∣ment. For
his part, he had made an assignation with Kitty, Madame St. Vivier's maid,
which he went to keep, but, by some accident or other, mis∣taking the
chamber, he had certainly introduced himself to Miss Tadpole, who, it was
plain, ex∣pected somebody; for, upon finding it impossible to answer
many of her questions, she was at first in manifest confusion, but
soon recovering herself, gave a turn to the unintelligible part of her
conver∣sation, and, in direct terms, made him understand that she took
him for Zekiel, though what she said was so worded that he plainly saw
this was the first interview of that nature which had passed, and which
she was evidently surprised into, owing to her ex∣pectation of some
other person.</P>
<P>Taking the hint, therefore, he passed himself on her for
my lord, which indeed spoilt all his scheme of pleasure for the remainder
of the night, except so much as gratified his curiosity; for having yielded
to his embraces before matters came to be explained, she took on strangely,
and complained of being ruined in her sleep, and all the old cant of those
ladies who are well versed in such arts as pass off their stale ware to
inexperienced young gentle∣men.</P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="165"/> 
<Q REND="inline">'I topped my part,' said Figgins, 'for
learning from her all those vows and promises which your precious brother
has made her, I confirmed them with a number of his quaint oaths, and at length
left her apparently satisfied.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'I should not forget to mention that after I
had been sometime in bed, a knocking and a voice was heard at the chamber
door, on which, in her fright, she said <Q REND="inline">"that is my brother, I know his voice"</Q>—'and so, by the way, did I. She would have let
him in, to have witnessed the protestations I had made her. This however
I overruled, and after a time the brother—for I dare say it was
he—went away; but, upon putting all considerations together, I am
convinced this Mr. Tadpole is the lady's gallant, and they are trying together
to noose your brother, which, upon my soul, I think, for the sake of the
family, ought to be pre∣vented.'</Q></P>
<P>Charles agreed to this, and said if Mr. Figgins would confront
the lady on their return—for they were now on the ramparts—he
would, in spight of his inward indignation for his brother, try to un∣deceive
him, and so save him from this infamy, that seemed to await him.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="166"/> Figgins said he was an excellent young
man, and he would second so laudable an endeavour with all his heart. 
<Q REND="inline">'But,' said Figgins, 'now we are on the
subject of last night, you, I find, kept my ap∣pointment; for Kitty tells
me this morning that some person stole into her room, whom she
mis∣took for me, but, finding her error—but not till she had
yielded—made the best of it, and hu∣moured the mistake.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'This is singular enough,' said Charles, 'I
as∣sure you it was not I; I was much better em∣ployed.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Are you sure of it?' said
Figgins.—</Q>
<Q REND="inline">'Oh certain,' said Charles. 'My
assignation was no mysterious one; I had no occasion to shroud my
designs in darkness, for the joys I reaped were heightened by the blushes
of my mistress, which were revealed to my view by a wax taper, which I dare
say was bought for a very different cere∣mony.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Then by God,' said Figgins, 'it was your
brother, who dubbed me with my harlot, while J was dubbing him by anticipation
with his wife, and I am damnably mistaken if he has not had such
anticipaters in the lady's favours for any time this four years.'</Q></P>
<P>This conversation brought them back to the inn, where they
found their whole benevolent design <PB N="165" REF="167"/> rendered abortive,
for Zekiel and his company had in their absence set out, and were now
several miles on their journey towards Ostend.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Let them go,' said Figgins, 'and since the
fellow will run his nose into the matrimonial gin, let him squeak for it;
but I hope, while I re∣probate his folly, I am not glancing at any in you.
Madame St. Vivier and you are evidently upon very kind terms; I need not hint
to your good sense that she is a mere adventurer..'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Oh,' said Charles, 'that one may plainly
see: I should like however to know her real story.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'That, for your sake, I have discovered,'
said Figgins.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Madame St. Vivier and her maid are neither more
nor less than Aimwell and Archer in the Beaux Stratagem. They are travelling
to the south of France, by the way of Lyons, which route I believe they take
simply because it is ours. On their return, by the way of Paris, Mrs. Kitty
is to be the mistress, and Madame St. Vivier the maid, and whatever they
pick up in their journey they are to go snacks in. The girl acknowledges to
me that the first idea was to trap you into a marriage, but finding we were
too knowing for them, and in facts better calculated to administer to their
pleasure than their convenience, like a <PB N="166" REF="168"/> couple of
generous girls as they are, every thing it seems is to be left to
ourselves.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Which generosity they must not repent,'
said Charles.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'By no means,' said Figgins; 'and if in our
way we meet with any English booby, not your brother, let them in God's name
profit of their good fortune.'</Q></P>
<P>This introduced some general remarks on En∣glish travellers,
which Madame St. Vivier inter∣rupted. Figgins acquainted her with the
discovery as to her scheme, and both the gentlemen assured her they
would assist it as far as they could, without injuring their characters
as men of honour.</P>
<P>Post horses were ordered to be ready the next morning. While
they were harnessing, Charles having occasion to pay the civility of an
adieu to a person in power, who had done him some kindness as to his
business at the custom-house, and other matters, had the curiosity to
call himself at the post office, for he had not yet received a single
letter from his father, though he had written several.—He was there
informed that there had been letters, but they were fetched away by a footman,
in a live∣ry exactly like his own, the day before. Charmed with these
tidings, he flew back to the inn, think-that <PB N="167" REF="169"/> the footman
must have been John, who had forgot to give them to him; but how great was
his surprise when John assured him he had received no letters, and
offered to go back to the post-office to rectify the mistake, whither they
immediately set out, Figgins begging them to be expeditious, for the horses
were put to. 
<Q REND="inline">'But stay Charles,' added Figgins, 'I will
tell you, as sure as you are alive, how the case is. Your brother's livery
is the same as yours; he has intercepted your letters, and is now gone the
devil knows where; and so the unnatural wretch, while you were saving his
reputation, and perhaps his life, by your unpa∣ralleled liberality, in the
affair of Dessein—owing I dare say to the cunning of the fellow who
tra∣vels with him, for he has not head enough him∣self—has hit upon
this treacherous plan to make a breach between you and your father.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'It must be so,' said Charles, 'but that
we may be sure I will write to Dessein, to know if he has sent any
letters, and his answer shall be addressed to Brussels.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Well thought,' said Figgins, 'we can do that
from the next post.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'But stay sir,' said John, 'I wish I
might go to the post-office, though I don't believe his honour thinks me
guilty.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Guilty of what, you foolish fellow?' said
Figgins, 'your master knows your fidelity:'—</Q><PB N="168" REF="170"/>
Nor will the reader be at a loss how much to lay to the account of it, when
he is told that this was the very John who, upon a former occasion, rescued
Lady Hazard, and refused Dogbolt's half-guinea.</P>
<P>The last is not the only hint contained in this chapter to
which I would have the reader minutely attend. It may be necessary probably
to revert to it in the course of the work; but if it tend to any material
circumstances that will more powerfully display themselves by being
developed in their place, I shall adhere to that rule I have in general set
down for myself, and only excite present curio∣sity, to strengthen
future gratification.</P>

<PB REF="171"/>
<HEAD>CHAPTER III.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>ONE THEFT ACTUALLY COMMITTED, AND A PLAN FORMED FOR
ANOTHER.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>ALL these circumstances together having con∣firmed Charles
in his opinion that Figgins was a sincere friend, John a faithful servant,
and Zekiel a great rogue, our travellers took the road to Brus∣sels, and at
the first stage our hero wrote to Mr. Dessein, as he had
resolved.</P>
<P>As I am writing the history of Charles Hazard, and not a tour
on the continent, I shall trouble my readers with no more than such
circumstances as immediately concern that young gentleman, or lead to his
affairs, together with such minutiae as naturally produced them, and such
remarks as may serve for their elucidation.</P>
<P>In conformity to these rules, I shall only say that at
Brussels nothing happened of consequence enough <PB N="170" REF="172"/>
for me to record except that Charles and Figgins became intimate with a young
Frenchman, named Combrie, who had stollen a nun, and married her. This couple
were glad enough to have escaped from France with safety, without staying
to accomplish a design which they had formed of getting the lady's fortune
out of the hands of a trustee, in which the church had placed it. They were
therefore little better off than in the possession of an unbounded
stock of love, and what money Mr. Combrie, who was the <HI>cadet</HI> of an
honourable family, had been able to procure from the fondness of a doating
mo∣ther.</P>
<P>Having however violated one of the most sacred laws of
France, by carrying a nun out of that king∣dom, the mettled Frenchman conceived
he could incur but little more blame if he pushed his point so far as to
take her fortune forcibly out of the hands of a litigeous <HI>procureur,</HI>
who had made use of the money to his own advantage for two years, and eluded
every attempt, even of the clergy, to get it from him.</P>
<P>The man of the law was however too vigilant and circumspect
for Combrie, who being a novice in a matter which required so much wary
caution and prudent resolution, and besides too much <PB N="171" REF="173"/>
transported with his expected happiness, he ma∣naged his plan so
bunglingly, that so far from suc∣ceeding with the <HI>procureur,</HI> he
had very nearly been defeated in his views concerning the lady.</P>
<P>Though this couple loved each other with perhaps more
tenderness for being without fortune, yet most people agree, and they could
not but yield to the general opinion, that money is a security for love,
especially after reflection takes place. In∣deed, being in a strange
country, from whence they must shortly, for the sake of safety, recede
further, they were not so blinded by their affection, but they saw that
their future prospects would be in a very doubtful way, if some scheme
was not hit upon to rescue the money before it could be con∣fiscated for
the use of the church.</P>
<P>Combrie, who had been at Brussels but a short time, yet
who was looked upon, in consequence of his shyness, as a very equivocal
character, saw plainly the danger of making a confident in that place, and as
an attempt at the recovery of his wife's fortune would be impracticable,
without a confederate or two, taking a hint from the strong congeniality that
appeared between the sentiments of our travellers and his own, he fancied he
should be safe at-least in their confidence, even if they did 
<PB N="172" REF="174"/> not lend him assistance. Besides, his affairs
were very pressing, and he doubted, if his resolutions were not
suddenly and effectually taken, whether the all-grasping power of the
church would not deprive him of every possible hope.</P>
<P>Having no time to deliberate, and being em∣boldened by the
engaging freedom and true breed∣ing of Charles and his friend, he ventured,
without reserve, to entrust them with his affairs, into which our friends
gave so freely, that Figgins, who the reader knows was no mean hand at a
plot, concer∣ted one that it was agreed would infallibly succeed, even
without rendering either him or his friend liable to the smallest
suspicion of being concerned in it.</P>
<P>Full of their project, the three friends set out, leaving
Madame Combrie in her apartments at Brussels, but first sending Madame
St. Vivier before them to Sedan, where she actually had business; for as
to themselves, out of safety to Combrie, they travelled to Nancy in
Lorraine, where lay the scene of action, by the way of Luxembourg, and, in
fact, as much in Austria as possible till they should come to Metz,
where they were to hold their grand counsel of war. Madame St. Vivier,
however, was not at all apprized of their business, but only in∣structed,
<PB N="173" REF="175"/> after she had accomplished hers, to meet them at
Nancy, to which Sedan lies in the direct road.</P>
<P>Without stopping to look at a single prospect, building,
or even crucifix, in the way, I shall set down my travellers at Metz,
where, by agreement, they separated, Charles and Figgins taking post
horses for Nancy, and Combrie jogging after them at his leisure, upon his
own horse: not however till they had agreed whereabout they should find him
in the suburbs, near which place Combrie had a trusty friend, who he was
sure would give him every necessary assistance.</P>
<P>Being arrived at Nancy, they went to the con∣vent of Chartreux,
where strangers, especially of condition, are for a short time treated
gratis. The members of this convent being all men of fortune, and, in general,
such as have retired from the world through disappointments at court, are
always charmed at the arrival of new guests, whether their visits be owing
to curiosity or necessity, but they are particularly pleased with the
English. No wonder then that the superior, when he understood that
Charles was a young English nobleman, and Figgins his governor; that they had
unexpectedly been deceived as to remittances from England, and 
<PB N="174" REF="176"/> therefore from actual necessity had intruded on
their generous institution, both for immediate succour and advice,
instantly signified—especially as their pretensions were
corroborated by the testimony of letters of credit and recommendation, and
many other authentic documents—his warmest wishes to enter heartily
into their interest. They paid him a number of acknowledgments for his great
civility to strangers, and said they piqued themselves on their own
sagacity, which had pointed out the pro∣priety of applying to a man of his
piety, as well as consequence, upon such an occasion, rather than run the
risk of being imposed upon by an indiscri∣minate choice of a person to
supply their present wants, without an eligible recommendation.</P>
<P>After this preface our travellers acquainted the superior that
they wished his reference to some money negociator, for a present
supply, who assur∣ing them that it would give him particular pleasure
to recommend them to some person who should treat them
conscientiously, mentioned his near re∣lation Monsieur Goufre, <HI>le
procureur:</HI> not however till he had expatiated on the wickedness of
those usurious wretches who take advantage of the neces∣sitous, and
oppress their fellow creatures under the idea of relieving them.</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="177"/> Figgins said he had heard of one
Monsieur Banc∣sec, but the superior assured them they could not get
into worse hands. Charles said certainly it would be their interest to
rely upon the superior's advice, and begged the favour of a note to
Mon∣sieur Goufre. This request was immediately com∣plied with, and our
friends went their ways to the gentleman's house in question, after
thanking the kind recluse in terms of the warmest gratitude.</P>
<P>Before however we introduce the reader to Mon∣sieur Goufre, it
will not be inexpedient to say how Charles and his friend happened to get
recom∣mended to the very man who retained Madame Combrie's fortune.</P>
<P>The reader has seen that he was a near relation to the
superior of the <HI>Chartreux,</HI> which was well known to Combrie, and it
will not appear extraordinary that this connection with the clergy should be
the means of Monsieur Goufre's being often employed in matters which
concerned the church. In fact, the frequent litigations by friends of the
deceased to recover monies conditionally left for charitable uses, on one
side, and the assertion of the church's right on the other, had, upon
many occasions, pro∣duced such a see-saw of interested altercation
be∣tween the <HI>procureur</HI> and the <HI>superieur,</HI> that matters 
<PB N="176" REF="178"/> perfectly plain and clear in themselves, often wore an
air of such mysterious embarrassment under such delusion as
frittered large legacies into bills of ex∣pences, which were cunningly
snacked by the law∣yer and the monk.</P>
<P>One of these lucrative bones, at which they had been a long
time nibbling, was Madame Combrie's fortune, the perfect situation of which,
nay even the drawer in which it was deposited, Figgins un∣dertook to procure
intelligence of; to do which, properly, they had recourse to the superior,
and through him were resolved to attack the heart of his relation in that
part where he was most vulner∣able—for it was not true that they
actually wanted money—and to give a colour to this it was no bad plan to
seize an opportunity of taking the <HI>Char∣treux</HI> by the outward
symbol of his profession, and make his charity, which was counterfeit,
the in∣strument of his real confusion.</P>
<P>Combrie being arrived in the Fauxbourg, and informed of their
resolves, the moment came to put their design in execution. Charles and
Figgins waited on the <HI>procureur,</HI> who, after all the necessary
difficulties, which, upon motion, was to be re∣moved by Monsieur Dessein,
agreed to accommo∣date them with what they should think necessary; 
<PB N="177" REF="179"/> for they had represented that they should change
their route so often, and probably from momentary in∣ducements, that it would
be better to take up in specie as much as would serve for some months,
and leave in the hands of Monsieur Goufre travell∣ing bills of Sir James
Herries, and other English bankers, to the amount of the sum and the
dis∣count.</P>
<P>Nothing retarded the payment of the money but waiting for a
letter from Monsieur Dessein, which at length arrived greatly to the
satisfaction of all parties. It spoke very handsomely of Charles and his
friend, and it is proper to mention that, over and above the business of
assuring Monsieur Goufre, it mentioned that letters had been sent to
Charles at Lisle, on account of which he had written to Brus∣sels, and
this confirmed Charles in his opinion of Zekiel's treachery. Figgins however
made a dif∣ferent use of this circumstance, greatly turning it to their
present account, for he proved very clearly that if those letters sent to
Lisle had been received, the application to Monsieur Goufre would have been
unnecessary.</P>
<P>During the interval between writing to Calais and receiving an
answer, Charles and Figgins had twice dined with the <HI>procureur,</HI> and
the latter had so <PB N="178" REF="180"/> insinuated himself into his good
graces, that under pretence of enquiring into the practice of the French laws,
he wormed out of him almost all his affairs. The endowments of the
monasteries naturally came up in their conversation, in which business
he owned he was very much employed, and one morning, when they were talking in
the counting-house upon this subject, the <HI>procureur</HI> said, as he
was locking up his bureau, 
<Q REND="inline">'here now is a pretty large fortune which has
been lessened almost one-fourth by liti∣gation. It belonged to a nun, who
has been lately stolen from a neighbouring monastry—there it is
labelled and sealed up, in notes upon the <HI>Caisse d'accompte, payable
au porteur—</HI>and I have now a supreme order, which I shall yield
to next week,—after I have made out my bill against it—to
sur∣renderit to the Lady Abbess.'</Q></P>
<P>Naturally guessing that nuns were not so fre∣quently
stolen but that her he had heard of must be Madame Combrie, Figgins found
his point so far gained, and now the letter being arrived from Ca∣lais,
nothing remained but to receive their money.</P>
<P>On the evening appointed for this business, the
<HI>procureur</HI> was invited by our travellers to a sump∣tuous
entertainment at the Hotel <HI>D'Angleterre.—</HI>Before supper the
ceremony of signing and sealing <PB N="179" REF="181"/> was performed, and
after supper all was hilarity. Figgins made the <HI>procureur</HI> harrangue,
Charles pre∣vailed on him to squall several <HI>chansons a boire,</HI>
and Madame St. Vivier, who arrived at Nancy that very afternoon, took him out
to walk a minuet with her. In short, the votary of chicane having made a good
bargain, a good supper, and fallen violently in love with Madame St. Vivier,
did not notice how the hours wore, and was at length, after a good finish∣ing
dose, carried to bed, in a condition that laid him by the heels till ten
o'clock the next morning.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER IV.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>IN WHICH THE LAITY PROVE TWO CUNNING FOR BOTH LAW AND
GOSPEL.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IT was three hours after Monsieur Goufre went home before he
discovered that any trick had been played him, for I hope the reader does not
suppose the supper was given for nothing. He asked one of the clerks if
any body had called while he was engaged the evening before, and was answered
no∣body of any consequence but Father Benedick.—
<Q REND="inline">'What Father Benedick?' said Goufre.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Him,' said the clerk, 'we sent to you at
the <HI>Hotel D'An∣gleterre,</HI> and by whom you sent your keys, with
written orders to deliver the fortune belonging to the convent of our lady of
the ascension.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Written orders! Keys!' cried the astonished
<HI>pro∣cureur.</HI></Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'But it is impossible; here are my
keys.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Well sir, these are the keys he brought,'
said the clerk, 'and here is the order: surely we know your hand
writing.'</Q></P>
<P>Upon this Monsieur Goupe read, in a faultering 
<PB N="181" REF="183"/> accent, and in a hand so like his own that he could
himself find no difference: 
<Q REND="inline">'Let Father Benedick have the packet in the
bureau labelled Money belonging to the convent of our lady of the
as∣cension.'</Q></P>
<P>As all the French dance well, it is not wonder∣ful that
Monsieur Goufre had scarcely read these words when he took a
<HI>chassee</HI> to the bureau, where he discovered the nest without
the bird, <HI>caprioled</HI> back to the parlour for his hat and cane,
<HI>rigadooned</HI> to the door, <HI>briseed</HI> out of it, and in a new
fashioned <HI>pas courant</HI> presently made an <HI>entre</HI> at the
house of the general of the police. There being joined by a proper number of
figurants, under the characters of <HI>sergeants du ville, archets,</HI> and
<HI>pouse culs,</HI> the <HI>procu∣reur</HI> paraded at their head to the
<HI>Hotel D'Angleterre,</HI> where, to enrich the procession back again, he
en∣treated our hero, Figgins, and Madame St. Vivier to perform a <HI>pas de
trois.</HI></P>
<P>In plain English, he fairly believed his pocked had been
picked while he was asleep, and that our travellers, who were thieves, had
taken this me∣thod to rob him; and having imparted these sus∣picions to
the general of the police, he obtained an order to bring the delinquents before
him.</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="184"/> A few words however served to convince
that of∣ficer, and even the <HI>procureur</HI> himself, that his
sus∣picions were groundless. The clerk deposed that about seven
o'clock in the evening, a person in the garb of a friar, calling himself
Father Benedick, came to their house, and said he had particular
bu∣siness with Monsieur Goufre, relative to a certain fortune belonging
to the convent of our lady of the ascension. He represented that upon
various pre∣tences it had been so long kept out of the church's hands, that
it was in agitation to procure a suspen∣sion of the <HI>procureur's</HI>
employments, if he should refuse immediately to deliver it. He said it
was pity Monsieur Goufre was not within, for his au∣thority was so powerful
and decisive, that if he re∣turned it would be with force, which he would
willingly avoid. The clerk said, in consequence of these menaces, he made
no scruple of sending the supposed friar to his master, who, about a
quar∣ter before eight, returned with Monsieur Goufre's keys, and a written
order to deliver the fortune which was locked up in the bureau, and which had a
label similar to that described in the said written order. The clerk
swore he believed it to be the hand writing of his master, and he was
sure the keys were those his master then held in his hand.</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="185"/> Mr. Figgins here entreated that he might
have permission to ask the <HI>procureur</HI> a few questions, which
request being complied with, he said 
<Q REND="inline">'Pray sir in whose company were you from
half past six o'clock till nine, during which time this fraud is said to
have been committed?'</Q></P>
<P> Monsieur Goufre answered in his company.—
<Q REND="inline">'Were you not,' said Figgins, 'during that
whole time, in your sober senses?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Perfectly,' an∣swered the man of law.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'And now let me rouse your best recollection
while I ask if in that very interval of time, you were not talking of your
ex∣tensive business, of your property, and indeed of this very fortune
you now say you have lost, but which you then bragged you had safely
locked up; as a proof of which you shewed us those very keys, and at the
very time as it should seem, that your clerk was using them—which
is a very likely story—to deliver that fortune up to a person he had
never before seen.'</Q></P>
<P>The poor <HI>procureur</HI> felt this unanswerable mode of
reasoning most severely, and the general of the po∣lice—whether
other cases had induced him to doubt the veracity of Monsieur Goufre, or
whether he was conscious that Englishmen are constantly upon these
occasions not those who dupe, but those who <PB N="184" REF="186"/> are
duped—seemed to pay great attention to Fig∣gins's harrangue, who
seeing his advantage, thought he could not do better than follow it up: which
he did in these words.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Upon the whole, it appears to me, and so it
shall to the English embassador, that Monsieur Goufre having found in
us a pretty free-milch cow, as to some money transactions we have had
toge∣ther, has fancied, notwithstanding the documents we have produced, that
we could not make good our pretensions to rank and independency, and
therefore imagined we might be awed, by the ac∣cusation of a sham robbery,
into a composition: and this appears from many circumstances.—What
had we to do with this fortune? Why were we to know in what place it lay? Why
have we been repeatedly shewn the key that locked it up? Besides, the
matter has been so bunglingly managed, that the clerk deposes that very key
was sent at the individual time he himself confesses to have had it in
his pocket. Then he does not pretend to say that the hand writing is not like
his, but, on the contrary, so like that he should have taken it for his
own. But it was necessary this should be said, because if the hand
writing had not been exactly like his, the clerk would have had no pretence
whatever to have delivered the <PB N="185" REF="187"/> fortune. Again, what was
this same Father Be∣nedick?—and how had he got all this intelligence?
How insinuated himself into his pocket invisibly, and conveyed away the
keys, during an interval of perhaps the only five minutes in an hour and a half
that they had been trusted there without his hand upon them for their
security; but, at any rate, to make the story in the smallest degree
colourable, what connection had this supposed Father Benedick with them, to
lend the smallest probability to their being concerned in a trans∣action
so very derogatory to their honour as gen∣tlemen, so totally
unnecessary to their circum∣stances, which Monsieur Goufre had taken
care, with the most scrupulous exactness, to make him∣self master
of—and so disgraceful to the name of Englishmen? How had it been
proved that they, so far from knowing the friar in question, had a single
associate, even of their own country?—for both the clerks gave very
clear testimony that Father Benedick spoke with an accent so pure and
vernacular, that they were sure he was a French∣man: and indeed so he was.
All these circum∣stances considered, it was impossible this affair
should be otherwise than a gross attempt—an event which occurred
too frequently—to impose upon English credulity; which, however
others <PB N="186" REF="188"/> might pass over, would not, in the present
in∣stance, be regarded in any light either trifling or pardonable; on the
contrary, it would be found that men of character had been tampered with, who
were both able and willing to right themselves. He therefore insisted,
for the sake of general jus∣tice and the honour of the English nation,
that the matter should be fully and publicly investigated: to which and
they would be content to submit to a temporary imprisonment, provided
Monsieur Goufre should be laid under the same restric∣tion.'</Q></P>
<P>The general of the police, whou could not pro∣bably see that
all this intelligence had been, by the most subtle train of artful
insinuation, deliberately drawn from Goufre, by Figgins, with a view to
forward the designs of Combrie—who the reader sees was father
Benedick—had no manner of doubt but that every word he had heard was
truth.</P>
<P>His own private opinion indeed was, that being in a short time
to deliver up the fortune, the <HI>procu∣reur</HI> had conjured up the whole
accusation to cover his embezzlement of the money. As to the friar, he had
not the least doubt but that he was a real character, procured probably by
his relation, the superior of the Chartreux, who, as we have said 
<PB N="187" REF="189"/> was occasionally concerned with Mr. Goufre in his law
practices.</P>
<P>In short, he so well knew, as he thought, the trim of the
business, that he would not have hesi∣tated to comply with the terms of
Mr. Figgins, had he not had some very material objections to get rid of.</P>
<P>In the first place, he well knew that their know∣ledge of each
others illicit conduct was mutual; they had trod together the paths of
oppression; and it was their constant custom when either was likely to
get into a scrape, to call the other to his assistance. In the
present case, however, the <HI>procureur</HI> had pre∣viously sworn to
the general of the police that he had actually been robbed, and this was indeed
the truth; but matters—thanks to Figgins's address—wore now so
different an aspect, that this seeming want of confidence quite
exasperated him, and no∣thing but his own actual safety made him hesitate
a moment to take part against the <HI>procureur.</HI></P>
<P>Balancing thus between his conviction and his interest, he
thought proper to pursue a middle course. He said, as there had actually
been no∣thing proved which had been alledged, he could not answer sending
to prison three persons, one of <PB N="188" REF="190"/> them a lady, who had
made so handsome a defence. Monsieur Goufre had certainly, in the first
trans∣ports of his resentment, done what he thought very justifiable, but
what, upon reflection, had neither certainty, nor even probability, to
support it; that it was plain he had been some way or other tricked, how
would very likely hereafter appear; and, if he had been too warm, stung as he
was at being de∣prived of a large deposite, which it would cut deep into his
fortune to make good, those very traits of liberality on which that
gentleman—meaning Fig∣gins—had dwelt, would, he hoped, induce him
and his friend to overlook surely a very pardonable error.</P>
<P>Charles said, Monsieur Goufre's mad manner of rectifying a
mistake, he thought, deserved no lenity at their hands. For his part he
should detest the idea of patching up a matter that struck so hard in
him at the honour of every young nobleman on his travels. He should think, if
he passed by such a glaring impertinence, every one of his English
ac∣quaintance ought to resent it. He should therefore acquaint the
English embassador, who was his fa∣ther's particular friend, of the whole
business, with∣out the smallest reserve; and if he must endure to
have a hated liberty forced upon him, he would at least, let his
inconvenience be what it might, stay <PB N="189" REF="191"/> in that town till
not only himself and his friend should be handsomely cleared, but till he
who had the audacity to scandalize their characters should meet with his
merited punishment. So saying, he gave the lady his hand, and said if
their forms would admit it he should chuse to go from that place, but that
he should be found at the <HI>Hotel D'Angleterre</HI> till the matter was
finally decided.</P>
<P>They were followed out by the general of the po∣lice, who
whispered Figgins, in the hall, that he plainly saw Monsieur Goufre had
done a rash thing, but that it need not hinder them from pursuing their
tour, for if they would leave twenty guineas in his hands, he would take care
as much justice should be done to their honour as if they were
pre∣sent.</P>
<P>In this I verily believe he spoke truth, but Fig∣gins cut him
short with this reply:</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Sir, If the law has any power over us, use it
now you have us in your custody; if not, the best of you shall have
reason to repent this outrage: and as to leaving twenty guineas in your
hands, I would do it with great pleasure, were I not un∣luckily bound by a
vow not to trust any French∣man further than I can see him.'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="192"/> The general of the police said it was a
great pity so good an opportunity should be lost, and added that perhaps
the young gentleman was not bound by the vow.</P>
<P>Charles said he was always bound by the deter∣minations of his
governor, especially when they went to a prevention of his being duped.</P>
<P>The general of the police not thinking fit to urge the matter
any farther, after many reverences, retired to the <HI>procureur;</HI> after
which our travellers departed, first giving the officers of justice
some∣thing to drink.</P>
<P>Monsieur Goufre was found by his friend in a state of
distraction. The latter however believed it all put on, and began very
severely to upbraid him with his duplicity, and to blame him for having made
such a fool of himself.</P>
<P>The <HI>procureur</HI> swore that he had been robbed, and was
ruined, and confirmed the oath with a hundred others. He was unfortunate enough
however to gain no manner of credit; on the contrary, the general of the police
told him, in so many words, that since he was above placing confidence in
his <PB N="191" REF="193"/> friends, he sincerely wished the Englishmen
might trounce him.</P>
<P>This introduced a warm bout at alternate recri∣mination, till at
length both became cool, and they determined, in conjunction with the
superior of the Chartreux, to take an early opportunity of delibe∣rating on
the most expedient means to get out of such a disagreeable scrape.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER V.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>AN EXPLANATORY LETTER—A LITTLE VEXATION—AND A
JOURNEY TO LYONS.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>MADAME St. Vivier had not the smallest idea that her
companions really knew any thing of the fraud. She had acted her part to
perfection the night before, as to making Monsieur Goufre drunk and
ridicu∣lous, but was ignorant that the trick went any fur∣ther than getting
good terms from him as to the money that was borrowed; neither had a syllable
of the situation of Madame Combrie been explained to her; for it is natural
to suppose our travellers did not so sin against good breeding as to
introduce such a character into that lady's company. She might be sent
purposely to Dover, and probably was in∣tended to be played off as a
<HI>corps de reserve</HI> upon our hero, but when no direct outrage on
propriety was necessary, Mr. Figgins was too great a general to call in
assistance, when every thing went on even beyond his wishes. But how
beyond his wishes? Patience, dear reader: I would not have you know 
<PB N="193" REF="195"/> what is brewing, just at present, for any
considera∣tion. Attend then, and let the fruit of your curio∣sity ripen by
degrees; nor—that it may have the better relish—wish to gather
it till it shall be ready to drop into your hand.</P>
<P>Four or five days after the affair of the general of the police,
the <HI>procureur</HI> waited on our travellers, with great deference and
respect, and informed them that he had received a letter which had
satis∣fied him in every point relative to the fraud. He therefore acquitted
them so heartily of any concern in that matter, that he appeared extremely
shocked at his conduct, and said he would publish their in∣nocence
coupled with any acknowledgment of his own, by way of concession, that they
should think proper to dictate. As to himself, he had the plea∣sure to
inform them that as it was now known he had not been to blame, at the mediation
of his re∣lation the superior of the Chartreux, and his friend the general of
the police, the chapter of the con∣vent to which the money was due had remitted
the payment of it till his death, provided he would then add the interest of
it, and an additional be∣quest of ten thousand crowns.</P>
<P>The letter to Monsieur Goufre was as follows:—
<PB N="194" REF="196"/> 
<LETTER>
<HEAD>TO MONSIEUR GOUFRE.</HEAD>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P> Lest your clerks, or any other innocent persons,
should suffer under the suspicion of having taken from your bureau that
fortune which in justice and equity is mine, in right of my wife, I write
this to acquaint you that, on Friday even∣ing last, about seven o'clock, I
called at your house, habited like a friar, and, under the name of Father
Benedick, demanded the fortune in your hands belonging to the convent of our
lady of the ascension; intimating that if I did not see you, be where you
might, I should return pre∣pared to compel you to resign it. Your clerks
referred me to you at the <HI>Hotel D'Angleterre,</HI> from whence I feigned to
return at about a quarter be∣fore eight, bringing with me a written order, as
if from you—a duplicate of which I have enclosed, to shew you how
well I counterfeited your hand writing—and a bunch of keys, one of which
opened your bureau. One of your clerks, so completely imposed upon,
naturally gave me what I wanted. I immediately departed, derobed my∣self of
my holy accoutrements, mounted my horse, and rode through bye-ways till I
arrived at Rouen <PB N="195" REF="197"/>—first taking care to touch the
<HI>'Argent Comptant,</HI> which, as you know, I was easily enable to do, as
the whole fortune was in notes on the <HI>Caisse d'ac∣compte</HI> at Paris,
payable <HI>au porteur—</HI>from whence, when I shall have put this
letter in the post, a vessel will carry me to Guernsey, and, before it
can reach you, I shall be in England.</P>
<P> It may not be amiss to tell you that the key which opened
your bureau I caused to be made from your own, for which purpose I took
care to be very much about you, before I stole my dear Araminta from her
hypocritical directress. I knew it always accompanied four others, the size
of which did not escape my notice: two of them open chests, one a small
cabinet, and the least a casket.</P>
<P> All these matters lent such strong probability to my
story, with which my holy garb so well agreed—a garb which was never
used to a wor∣thier purpose—that it was impossible for me not to
succeed.</P>
<P> If this confession will do you any good with the
church, you are welcome to make what use of it you think proper. As to
myself, I shall glory in its publication, for I am sure the money 
<PB N="196" REF="198"/> that serves to maintain an honest pair, whose
views are honourable and their actions exemplary—but more especially as
that money is their right—is more worthily, nay more religiously
applied than in fattening and encouraging in li∣centiousness those
slothful drones who, as you and I know, shut themselves up from the world
not to cherish holiness, but to hide profligacy.</P>
<CLOSER>
<SIGNED>From Yours, &amp;c. COMBRIE.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER></P>
<P>This letter, which speaks so plain, completes the account of
Figgins's scheme, which I have thus piece-meal explained to the reader. The
circum∣stance of the keys, which was a fact, together with the knack which
Combrie had of imitating Goufre's hand writing,—which indeed is not
difficult, for al∣most all Frenchmen write alike—gave a hint of it, and
the idea of an application to the superior of the Chartreux, and all those
concurrent circumstances which we have seen so well managed, could not
fail to crown it with success.</P>
<P>This history then has so far acted in its customary
province as to make one couple happy already. How long they are to continue
so, it is not im∣possible <PB N="197" REF="199"/> but we may hereafter
have occasion to no∣tice.</P>
<P>It will easily be seen that this affair ended greatly to the
honour of our travellers, who, in conse∣quence, attracted the notice of all
the English who then resided at Nancy. Among the rest they were visited
by a gentleman, whose company, as a plain straight-forward, well-meaning
man, was very a∣greeable to them. He served admirably well to make one at a
party of whist, and for a cursory ac∣quaintance really was not without his
merit.</P>
<P>A very short time however let them into the cha∣racter of this
new acquaintance, whose name was Ireland; for one night, being at whist,
with Mr. Figgins for his partner, Charles was so tantalized into betting, and
confused off his guard, that he got up from the table an hundred and fifty
pounds loser, in spight of all the hints and expostulations of Fig∣gins,
who only played for crowns.</P>
<P>The next day he heard, from undoubted autho∣rity, that Mr.
Ireland was an errant sharper, and had escaped from England after killing a
gentle∣man in a duel, who had dared to tax him publicly with a palpable
fraud.</P>
<P><PB N="198" REF="200"/> This loss however had one good effect
upon our hero, for he made a most solemn vow never again to lose five
pounds at one sitting, which resolution he inviolably kept to the day of
his death.</P>
<P>I have said very little of Charles's continual
dis∣appointments, at not receiving letters from his fa∣ther, or indeed any
body else, since his departure from England. The truth is that it gave him
in∣expressible concern, and occasioned from him many and various
remonstrances, which were apparently very little heeded.</P>
<P>Figgins testified as much uneasiness as our hero, but upon
this, as well as every other subject, he comforted him by a variety of
arguments. He said it very often occurred that people on a tour missed of
their letters, though at length they came safely to hand; that at Nancy, for
example, it was some∣times three weeks before a man could write a letter and
receive an answer to it; and this inconvenience would encrease in
proportion as they went farther. There was no doubt, he said, but every thing
would fall upon its legs, and the letters would all come together in a lump,
and he cheerfully agreed to wait at Lyons till every proper explanation could
be mutually exchanged, not only as to Charles and his father, but every other
correspondent.</P>
<P><PB N="199" REF="201"/> This kind accommodation in Figgins gave
our hero great pleasure. He had really, at times, felt very unpleasantly on
this subject, and though he could account for his disappointment at
Lisle, yet more than two months had elapsed since that time, during which
interval he had repeatedly written in such a full and satisfactory manner,
that he could not bear to reflect on the parting between him and his father,
and, at the same time, hold in mind that all his attempts to learn the
state of that ami∣able parent's mind were continually baffled. He knew not
what might have happened in his ab∣sence: he had dreaded to leave him: nay he
would not think on the subject, it was dreadful to him! yet he could not give
a reason for it. Who knew but the letters received at Lisle, since he had
heard nothing afterwards, might give an account of an unfavourable alteration
in his father's health: per∣haps they contained a tender injunction to come and
close the dying eyes of an indulgent parent: per∣haps he was then dead, and
the letters were from friends who gave him the melancholy news, which his
perfidious brother had received with a trium∣phant and cruel joy.</P>
<P>Reflections like these greatly embittered the en∣joyments of
our hero, and though I have not thought it necessary to present the
reader with any <PB N="200" REF="202"/> thing but the agreeable side of the
picture, yet it is certainly true that Charles had his moments when he felt
very severe and bitter unhappiness; nay he had once very nearly determined
to return to Calais, the better to investigate this unpleasant
business, though the natural gaiety, and I will say honesty, of his
disposition, prevented his particular griefs from interfering with
pleasures in which others were concerned. What wonder then if the kind
consoling advice of Figgins kept his mind in that tranquillity which made it
impossible for an un∣concerned person to penetrate his chagrin.</P>
<P>I have conceived it necessary to say thus much, lest the
reader should think our hero had, in imita∣tion of some other heroes, left
his feeling in his own country, and that his foreign freaks—every one of
which I undertake to contend had a defensi∣ble motive—were merely the
common effect of that fashionable conceit and supercilious levity which are
the qualities the French have, in general, a right to take as a sample of
English manners.</P>
<P>All affairs at Nancy being properly settled, Charles began to
be very impatient for their de∣parture to Lyons. Before they set out,
however, he drew up a recapitulation of all his other letters, to which he
added many earnest entreaties; and, <PB N="201" REF="203"/> that it might be
sure to go safe, entrusted it to the care of Figgins himself, who
insisted upon putting it in the post office, swearing he began to
suspect every body; and, when he returned, said that Master John
should not be so confidently trusted for the future. 
<Q REND="inline">'Why so?' said Charles.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Nay no great matter,' answered Figgins.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'I begin to have my suspicions of him: but
perhaps these devils of women have corrupted him.'</Q></P>
<P>Charles asked his friend what induced his suspi∣cions.
Figgins said, 
<Q REND="inline">'I caught the rascal in a lie, that is all:
which I cannot bear. Dam'me if there is so pimping a thing upon earth as an
un∣necessary lie.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'From a person in whom you place confidence,'
said Charles, 'there cannot be a crime of such magnitude. As death is
better than torture, so open enmity is better than hid∣den deceit. Even a
trifling lie, in such circum∣stances, may conceal the most tremendous
conse∣quences. For my part, I look upon plain inte∣grity to be so
positively essential in the composi∣tion of a friend, that though I
were one mass of imperfections, I would forgive the continual rei∣teration of
them, both to myself and the world, rather than they should be
hyperbolically glossed over. On the contrary, if I thought the man I 
<PB N="202" REF="204"/> trusted could even meditate a wish to deceive me,
let my partiality be what it might, I would tear him from my heart, even though
it should burst in making the effort.'</Q></P>
<P>Figgins, who had eyed our hero with extraordi∣nary tokens of
amazement, while he animatedly pronounced these words, first looked pale,
then red, but recovered however in time to put in for his share of this
honest opinion; and, after an eulo∣gium on Charles's way of thinking, and
reflecting on John, who alone he chose to understand as the per∣son all
this warmth was levelled at, he finished his remark with 
<Q REND="inline">'Damn the fellow, I should be sorry to find
him a rascal, for I have a regard for him.'</Q></P>
<P>Charles certainly had no particular meaning in the words he had
uttered, but his disappointment at not hearing from his father gave him
occasionally a kind of peevish discontent, as if he found some∣body had
deceived him, though he knew not who. As a proof that he had not the
smallest mistrust of Figgins, he entrusted him, as we have just
seen, with his letter to put in the post office; yet he was scarcely gone
but he wished he had taken it himself: though he sincerely believed this
wish a tacit, though an involuntary, injustice to his friend.</P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="205"/> The contents of his letter next were gone
over in his mind, in which he found nothing but a repe∣tition of
disappointments, that, for ought he knew, would be rewarded with new ones;
especially as he was confident, in his own mind, they originated in some
secret cause which he had not been, nor should ever be perhaps, able to
penetrate. In this trim of thinking, when Figgins returned and dropt those
hints concerning John, out came the very soul of our hero, and so it would
have done had his own ruin been the consequence.</P>
<P>Figgins—for what reason perhaps the reader may
conceive—verily believed this thrust was at him, and though he not only
saw he had well parried it, but, as he firmly believed, disarmed his young
friend of all suspicion, yet he feared, that should he take in his head
to arm himself frequently with these im∣patient doubts, as he did not want
for skill in these sort of conflicts, he, Figgins, might one day or other
receive such a hit as might prove a mortal stab to all his hopes of
bringing those schemes to bear which he certainly, for some reason or
other, was concerting; for though I have constantly allowed that Charles was
credulous, he could not be grossly imposed upon; and no man knew this
better than Figgins, who, with all his management, would not have been able
easily to gain his ends, which <PB N="204" REF="206"/> were now—though
the reader, as I have said, must wait with patience to know
how—nearly accom∣plished, had not a series of unexpected events
con∣curred to give him a helping hand.</P>

<PB REF="207"/>
<HEAD>CHAPTER VI.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>FULL OF INTERESTING MATTER—AND, AMONG THE REST, TWO
DEATHS.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>OUR travellers arrived at Lyons after a safe and pleasant
journey. They visited every thing curious, were frequently at the play, made
acquaintance with men of condition and taste, and, in short, here, as in
other places, availed themselves of every opportunity of improvement: thus
fulfilling the real purposes of travelling.</P>
<P>These matters however I have even less time to particularize
here than I had heretofore, and therefore shall leave to the readers
imagination what was the employment of a young man and his governor who were
really ambitious of returning home with as much knowledge as they could pick
up, but which acquisition Charles in particular—as the reader shall
hear—became possessed of more than he wished.</P>
<P>Our hero, walking one day in a field beyond the ramparts, was
meditating on a small book, in the <PB N="206" REF="208"/> midst of a grove,
when he heard behind him a rustling. Directing his eyes to the place from
whence the noise issued, he saw two men very warmly attacking each
other with drawn swords. In the impetuosity of his first sensations,
he bounded like a fawn to the place, and drawing to part the combatants, one of
them, like Mercutio, was hurt under our hero's arm. He faultered out 
<Q REND="inline">'<HI>Oh Jesu Je suis mort!</HI>'</Q> and
fell down.</P>
<P>Charles was so dreadfully shocked at this acci∣dent, that he
thought of nothing but endeavouring to succour the wounded person, on which
chari∣table employ he was so intent, that he did not pay the smallest
regard to the other, who, upon seeing his antagonist drop, fled with the
fwiftest precipi∣tation.</P>
<P>A moment's recollection convinced our hero that he was in a
most singularly perilous situation. The poor wounded wretch seemed to
be dying, and every circumstance would serve to make it believed that he
was the murderer. Nevertheless, his strong humanity so prevailed over his
prudence, that he ran without the wood, and holloed to the centinel upon the
ramparts for help, telling him there was a man dangerously wounded.</P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="209"/> Several gentlemen who were walking on the
ram∣parts presently came up, to whom Charles related, but not without much
confusion—for he was most exceedingly affected—the whole matter
as it had passed. Unfortunately his relation gained very little credit.
They all knew the nature of duelling, and naturally imagined a prudent person
would, upon such an occasion, go another way rather than interfere with two
men who were agreed upon fairly deciding a quarrel by the law of arms.</P>
<P>Charles was astonished when he understood their
suspicions, and could not help asking, with some disdain, whether the
French always requited the good offices of strangers in the same manner.
One or two of the gentlemen took heat at this, and said he should answer
every thing at large before the general of the police.</P>
<P>Charles treated their menaces with perfect in∣difference,
relying upon the testimony of the dying man, who however left his protector
in the lurch; for after an ineffectual attempt to speak, he pointed to
Charles, and falling backward, expired.</P>
<P>This action was universally allowed to have been intended as a
sign to distinguish the murderer, and what strongly corroborated the
general opinion was <PB N="208" REF="210"/> our hero's sword, which was very
much stained with blood. It was in vain that he accounted very na∣turally for
this circumstance, by saying that when he first saw the dead man fall,
he abandoned his sword, the better to lend him assistance, and that of
course, as it lay, the blood, which ran in a stream, had fallen upon
it.</P>
<P>This was construed into cunning and art. In short, the guard
arrived, and he was conducted to the house of the general of the police,
comforted however with 
<Q REND="inline">'<HI>Courage! on pardon en France un coup de
vivacite.</HI>'</Q> In spight however of these com∣fortable tidings,
Figgins, who had been waiting for our hero to breakfast at their inn, was
very soon summoned to breakfast with him in prison.</P>
<P>Figgins insisted upon it, in the strongest terms, that
it was impossible his friend could be concerned in this business
otherwise than as an accidental me∣diator. The gentleman who had fallen was a
man of some consideration, resident in that place, where Charles was an
absolute stranger, and had not the smallest acquaintance. He offered to
swear that, till this unhappy morning, he had never been a single ten
minutes out of his company since his ar∣rival in Lyons, and how could so
serious a quarrel have engendered without previous malice?—with∣out 
<PB N="209" REF="211"/> the smallest acquaintance with the unfortunate
person, or even knowledge that any such man had existence? He maintained
there was not upon earth a less turbulent spirit than his friend; that his
disposition was the sweetest, mildest, most benig∣nant, in the
world; that there could not be in na∣ture a more benevolent heart. He would
answer with his life that, was the fact as they suspected, his young
friend had not the soul to be guilty of such low, such treacherous
baseness as to disown it. On the contrary, as no laws were so lenient,
as to accidental rencounters, as those of France, so far from denying what
had happened, he would feel enough at having been the destruction of a fellow
creature, however unintentionally, without adding guilt to misfortune, by
excusing himself at the ex∣pence of a wilful lie.</P>
<P>Besides these arguments, Figgins insisted that they had
not consulted even common probability in this business. His friend had
averred that the murderer fled. Who was he then? No people were so remarkably
provident as to who went and came as the French. Let the book of the general of
the police be consulted, and see who had retired from the town. If he was a
settler, it would easily be known; if a stranger, intelligence of him
might be gathered at the place where he lodged. As to the <PB N="210" REF="212"/> action of the dying man, he was assured it had been intended to
point out his friend as one who had endeavoured to preserve him. In short,
he said let the matter but have time, and be maturely investi∣gated, and he
would resign himself as an accom∣plice, and willingly await the same
fate: staking his own life upon the issue of his friend's inno∣cence.</P>
<P>This manly and noble speech, which was made in presence of
some of the most considerable people of Lyons, had its effect. It was
warmly agreed, even by the relations of the deceased—who, by the bye,
got a fortune by his death—that every thing ought to be well
considered. Accordingly, the term of six weeks was fixed to make all the
neces∣sary enquiries, at which time it was intended, if nothing happened to
exculpate our hero, that he should be brought to trial.</P>
<P>It was now the business of Figgins to alleviate, as much as
possible, the distresses of his friend.—he had however very
little comfort for him. It had been found that a stranger had actually
ab∣sconded on the very morning this sad affair hap∣pened, but as the inland
towns in France are not so particular as to mere strangers as the
sea-ports, he could not learn his name. He asked Charles if he 
<PB N="211" REF="213"/> had no idea who the murderer was. Charles said he had
scarcely given him a single look, so instan∣taneously was the
mischief done; and that from that moment he had not seen him at all, his
whole care having been directed towards the dying man: but, notwithstanding
all these disadvantages, he was sure he had somewhere seen him,
though it was then utterly out of his power to recollect when or where.</P>
<P>In a few days after the imprisonment of our hero, Figgins came
to him and said he was greatly afraid there was some damned plot in the
business, for that the women were gone off, and had taken John with
them.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'What plot can there be?' said Charles.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'In this situation they are tired of us, and
resolved to shift for themselves: a very common resolution for
creatures of their stamp.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'True,' said Fig∣gins, 'but how will you
reconcile the conduct of Mr. John? I will tell you what has lately struck
me.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'What?' said Charles.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Why,' answered Figgins, 'that this same
Madame St. Vivier is known to Mrs. O'Shocknesy, and, if so, there is no
mischief, however detestable, but you may apprehend. That woman has the
hypocrisy of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> crocodile, the
heart of a tygress, and the malic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="212" REF="214"/> of the devil. She delights in mischief; it seems to
be as requisite to her existence as food; there is not such an infernal
succubus in human nature; and may I be damned'—for our friend Figgins
would sometimes swear—'if it were my fate to chuse whether to
encounter the anger of a hungry lion, or groan under the influence of a plot
against me, prepared and inflicted by that she fiend, if I would not
trust the claws of old Leo rather than the diabolical fangs of Mother
O'Shocknesy.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Now you may remember,' continued Figgins, 'I
caught Master John in a lie. It was this:—Kitty had told me she had
seen this gentleman of ours very busily employed in a familiar
conversa∣tion at Lisle with that fellow of your brother's, Flush, whom,
by the way, I never liked—indeed I know Mr. Standfast turned him off on
account of his attachment to Mrs. O'Devil. Why Mrs. Kitty told me this I
remember I thought very odd at the time, but catching from it, at the moment,
an idea concerning the embezzlement of the let∣ters, I, with more bluntness
than wit, taxed the gentleman with his intimate acquaintance with Mr. Flush,
which he denied, and which Kitty confirmed to his face. It was this determined
me to take your letters myself, and this has kept me ever since upon my
guard, as to this fellow; <PB N="213" REF="215"/> and finding now which way he
inclines, it is more than possible he has been a rascal all along, and
that even the half-guinea he refused from Sir Daniel Dogbolt was a feint,
through which he acted according to his instructions.'</Q></P>
<P>Charles said he had never correctly understood that
business, or what it alluded to; nor had he known more than that some
difference had happened between his father and mother, which had been happily
adjusted through the mediation of Mr. Standfast.</P>
<P>Figgins said when his mind could bear the rela∣tion he would
acquaint him with all the particulars, exactly as it had been related by my
lord to the sur∣geon, at the John of Gaunt's Head, and who he said had,
spight of all Standfast's care, not preserved the secret so
sacredly as a man of his profession ought. This however did not happen to
be the truth, for it was through Mr. Standfast, and no other person, that
Mr. Figgins came by his intelligence. 
<Q REND="inline">'But,' said Figgins, 'to finish with this
dear harmless lady, whom I so dearly love, if she has any hand in your
affairs, you may be assured it will be pro∣ductive of mischief to you
both in England and here.'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="214" REF="216"/> Charles said he had no doubt of the
gentlewo∣man's kind offices, but yet he saw no harm that could come of them,
for his father was pretty well upon his guard against her; and as to his own
con∣duct, it was, he flattered himself, at least in mate∣rial points, not
such as to merit reproach. 
<Q REND="inline">'All I wish,' said he, 'is to hear from my
dear father; if he remain safe from the malice of our enemies, I will forgive
every thing they can do to me.'</Q></P>
<P>This subject however was never out of Figgins's mouth, and
indeed, though nothing could be ma∣naged with more cautious delicacy, one would
think he had an inclination to sink his friends spirits till he should be
inclined to save the trouble of a public trial, by hanging himself in his
prison.</P>
<P>All this however was not sufficient to damp the spirits of
our hero, though I must own his situation seemed a good deal to tire his
patience. He had so invariably adhered to those principles which, at his
outset in life, he had so invariably laid down for himself, that,
conscious of his own innocent in∣tentions, he did not believe it possible
that he could sink under the weight of injustice. He therefore entreated
his friend—who, as the trial approached, put on looks more and more
rueful—to make him∣self easy. 
<Q REND="inline">'How can I?' said Figgins. 'All the 
<PB N="215" REF="217"/> devils in hell, one would think, conspire against
you. I declare to God to see virtue like yours so oppressed is enough
to make one curse one's be∣ing, and wish rather to be the vilest reptile
than a human creature.'</Q> And then would he enu∣merate the damned things, as
he called them, that had fallen out to thwart the good intentions of our hero;
and these would he follow up with his ap∣prehensions for his safety; then
cut a little out of the way to take a wipe at that fury in petticoats, Mrs.
O'Shocknesy; then curse, then hope, then shudder, then admire again the
fortitude of his friend, and then exclaim that in such an infernal world as
this, it was not worth while to be virtuous, for that none but rascals were
happy.</P>
<P>It was about two days before the trial, when he had one morning
wound up, or rather let down, our hero, by similar remarks to these, that
he un∣dertook to go through the whole business of Miss Snaffle, with all
its consequences, which really shocked Charles to such a degree that his
spirits were scarcely able to bear it. Seeing this, Figgins cursed
himself for his inconsiderate rashness. Said he, 
<Q REND="inline">'My unconquerable friendship makes me a fool;
and, in proportion as you are oppressed, you so creep into my heart,
that, out of complaisance to your curiosity, I do the very things which
un∣man <PB N="216" REF="218"/> you, when—if like other men I had more art
than honesty—I should try to render you cal∣lous to your fate, rather
than melt you into almost a desire to meet it. But come Charles,' added he,
embracing him, 'I will stand by you nobly, and if you must fall, you
shall not want a friend to revenge you.'</Q></P>
<P>In this delightful mood did this kind friend per∣mit Charles to
remain for that day. On the next he entered his friend's apartment with a
most cheer∣ful countenance, saying there was long-looked-for come at
last, and with these words presented a packet of letters, which he said
were just arrived by the post; but that was not all, another parcel had
been left at their bankers, which he supposed con∣tained the whole of his
father's letters, ever since he left England.</P>
<P>Charles, who had hastily catched at the first letter that
came to his hand, opened it, and found it from Sir Sidney. He wondered to see
it begin with Sir, but getting to the second line, while Figgins was uttering
those last words, which he did not hear, he exclaimed 
<Q REND="inline">'Merciful God!'</Q>—and fainted away.</P>
<P>Assistance was summoned, and he recovered; when, having
raved himself almost into another <PB N="217" REF="219"/> swoon, he became
stupid with horror. At length he grew more calm, and being entreated by his
friend to bear his fortunes like a man, he gathered composure enough to read
the following words. 
<LETTER>
<HEAD>TO CHARLES HAZARD ESQ.</HEAD>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P> It is my duty to inform you—though I scarcely think
it will give you any pain—that your father is no more! He died
suddenly:—Rumour will too soon tell you how: but shudder to think
that your excesses have shortened his life!</P>
<P> Those excesses, which are, at your age, and for the
short time in which you have committed them, the most shocking that ever
were heard of, have been but too well authenticated to us; therefore, upon no
account will I either see you, or hear from you.</P>
<P> You are willed by your exasperated and unhappy
father—who had not the heart to alter his first in∣tentions—your
mother's jointure, which is thir∣teen hundred a year, and the interest of
nine <PB N="218" REF="220"/> thousand pounds: both for your life. I am sole
executor, but as I am firmly resolved to have no sort of communication with
you, Mr. Balance will honourably negociate this business.</P>
<P> My determinations are unalterable, therefore all attempts
to deter me from them will be use∣less.</P>

<Q REND="inline">'Mrs. O'Shocknesy,' said Fig∣gins.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Did I not tell you so? She saw the

the other. I am sure of it: I would stake my soul that it is a
fact.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Alas, my poor father!' said Charles, 'how
properly is this a sequel to the wretched business of yesterday! But I
to be the cause of his death! I, who would have given a thousand
lives—infa∣mous as I am—to save his. Oh my forboding heart, why
did I part from him? But he could <PB N="219" REF="221"/> not believe it. What
are my villanies? Is it my crime or my virtue that has brought me here? Surely,
surely, thus attacked, Innocence may de∣fend itself.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Yours is immaculate,' said Figgins, 'and I
will maintain it; nor indeed will any body doubt it when we come to England.
The villany has reached its consummation: all its purposes are effected. It
will be easily found a mistake; it will be palliated, glossed over; but
how will it bring your father from the grave? But come, we have need of all our
senses at this moment; let us collect them manfully; we have no guilt to
sink us, whatever our accusers may. Come Charles, resolution man: I have
been the partner of your guilt, I will be the partner of your re∣venge. Let us
see what comes next: this is from Mr. Standfast. Shall I read it?</Q>
Charles assented by a nod, and Figgins read thus:

<P> First then, would not one think that you de∣termined to

<P> To as∣sist in stealing a nun from a convent, must

<P>—But let it mortify you to reflect that you were not
to enjoy the fruits of your wickedness, but that it was to be wrested from
you by your superior in subtilty, though not in crime, for the purpose of
squandering it upon your own har∣lot, who nows revels with him, and laughs at
you, and who, such is the certain dependance of one bad character upon
another, robbed and de∣serted you at Lyons, upon finding you committed to

<ARGUMENT>
<P>MORE LETTERS, AND SOME HEROISM.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'WELL by heaven,' said Figgins, as he folded
up Mr. Standfast's letter, 'this is the most con∣summate piece of cruel
treachery that surely ever was concerted. I could gnaw my flesh. And then
this last business! To practise on the inex∣perience of your
mistress! Damned mixture of stupid credulous folly, and ignorant
obstinate pride. I suppose they intend to marry her to your
brother.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'I believe they do not know themselves what
they intend' said Charles. 'This I know, that they have given me a very
grounded, though a very early, conviction that there is not upon the face of
nature so contemptible a being as a hu∣man creature; and I am strongly
convinced that, should the event as to my present situation turn out
favourably—which I am perfectly careless about—though I hope I
shall love benevolence as much as ever, I shall hereafter look with an eye 
<PB N="230" REF="232"/> of distrust on every man whom I have not proved yet
not superficially, but from that sort of thorough conviction which you have
given me—to be my friend.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'I thank you sir,' said Figgins, 'for a
compli∣ment which I hope I shall deserve. But you will give me leave to
say that I am astonished at the tranquillity with which you receive all
these un∣merited affronts. I expected—though I rejoice to find it
otherwise—that such a complication of invidious calumny would have
almost turned your brain'</Q>—and in this Mr. Figgins spoke truth,
for he did so expect—
<Q REND="inline">'and especially this last blow concerning
your mistress.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'The very number and weight of these
slanders,' said Charles, 'are what makes me sit down per∣fectly easy
under them. I was in a flattering dream as to the world, and fondly fancied
myself in the midst of generous friends, who, till I left my native
country, were willing to give me cre∣dit for any little merit I
possessed, and anxiously studious to find a venial motive for any
indiscre∣tion. But this present moment convinces me I was mistaken; their
discernment, as to my real character, was so shallow, that it is plain
they laid up every little trait of youthful folly to ground 
<PB N="231" REF="233"/> a falacious argument upon, which they now be∣lieve to be
solid reason. This, co-operating with the most unworthy and unheard of
treachery, they have given me up as a profligate and an abandoned character,
impossible to be reclaimed; and this calumny from a quarter they all
detest—which common reflection must call impossible and a
lie—is cherished warmly, zealously: cherished to the utter
reprobation of him for whom they pre∣tend a friendship. To whom then does the
re∣probation really belong? Does it not recoil on themselves? And what
compliment should I pay myself by calling that man my friend who is so
ready blindly, ignorantly, unfeelingly to think me the worst villain that
ever infested the earth? Perhaps they did not know that I do possess
one quality in as strong, but I hope as honest, a degree at least as any
of them. If I do not flatter my∣self, my pride is of the right sort; and it
shall not bend to the least explanation till I have re∣ceived a
concession from those who have injured me. No, no, Figgins, an emperor
shall not trample upon me; and by all that is sacred I will see
contrition in my enemies before I deign to communicate with them.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'My noble friend,' cried Figgins.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Let me finish,' said Charles. 'As to
Annette, she is a <PB N="232" REF="234"/> beautiful girl, and I love her
better than any wo∣man I ever saw; or rather, what I feel for her is more
like love than I have felt for any other; but I never could flatter myself we
should ever be united: there was always a something about my mind that
forbade me to think of it. As matters are I will forget her; for though I am
convinced this prohibition—so perverse is human nature—would
soon, were I to give way to it, make a fool of me, yet it shall not be; for
I will not love her dishonourably, and as to marriage, I do not love the
world so well as to bring its cares upon my head.'</Q></P>
<P>Figgins expressed more amazement at this calm, easy,
resolute good sense, as he was pleased to call it, than at the rest;
and then they proceeded to a third letter, which proved to be from Mr. Gloss.
It contained these words: 
<LETTER>
<HEAD>TO CHARLES HAZARD, ESQ.</HEAD>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>MY DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P> I must begin my letter in the true mer∣cantile style,
by saying that my first twelve <PB N="233" REF="235"/> epistles not being
honoured, I send this my thir∣teenth, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P> Jesting apart, my good friend, you are the strangest
model of eccentricity that ever let in∣consistency run away with
reason.</P>
</LETTER> 
<Q REND="inline">"What schooled on all sides!" said
Figgins.</Q> 
<LETTER>
<P> For my own part, I neither see the satisfaction nor the
good sense in suffering all your friends to write so repeatedly,
without deigning to answer their fa∣vours; nor how a man can be so
infatuatedly sunk in the delirium of idle pleasures—which are to be
sure well enough in their season—as to neg∣lect the much more
important duties of friendship and relative affection.</P>
<P> I need not tell you, for you must have received them,
that nearly thirty letters from your father and others have been sent
you.</P>

<Q REND="inline">"These are some of them I suppose,"
said Figgins.</Q>

your father has shot himself,</P>

on the score of the many shining qualities you certainly possess,
those engaging manners, those bewitch∣ing attractions, and that dawning
reason, which <PB N="234" REF="236"/> was, for your years, so decisive and
manly, you may command my friendship as far as one gentle∣man ought to
assist another:—</P>
</LETTER></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"On the score of all these
considerations," said Figgins, "you had better, upon my soul, Mr.
Gloss, let him command your polite, and there∣fore unmeaning, friendship on
the score that is between you, and then he would receive about three hundred
pounds, which you borrowed of him in driblets. But let us see
further."</Q></P>

<Q REND="inline">'Here is another precious member of the human
community,' said Charles.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Sir,' said Figgins, 'what I have heard and
seen to-day baffles my whole experience; and, for the future, I will not
believe that because I see a man do a good or a sensible thing, that he
will not do a wicked or a stupid one; but, on the contrary, expect to see
him turn about, and exhibit that various, pitiable, contemptible figure that
the best and the wisest I find are too apt to represent.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'To be sure there is one thing in their

plain to be seen how all this has come about? Has not the very rascal
prevented it who has gone over to bear false witness against me?'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'True,' cried Figgins, 'and then which way
shall we reconcile to the wisdom of Mr. Standfast, or the goodness of
Sir Sidney, so hasty a belief of such slander against one, of whom it
has been their pride to have had such a good opinion.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'If their conduct be goodness and wisdom,'
said Charles, it is both superficial and supererogate. There is not
common sense in it, and I am sure there is not common good manners: for
what virtue is that which condemns unheard?—and what modesty that has
the presumption to punish without the right? What are my actions, after
all, to these people? Am I dependant on them? No, I thank God, I am not; nor
will I ever call one of them my friend: nay nor any man upon earth who shall
be bold enough to scrutinize my intentions. No, my will, my desires, my
con∣duct, shall be my own; and if I cannot make friendship upon any other
terms, I would rather be alone in the world with integrity of heart, than give
colour, by my intimacy, to their suspicions who have dared to think me a
villain.'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="237" REF="239"/> 
<Q REND="inline">'Admirably reasoned, my friend,' said
Figgins, 'and I am sorry for their sakes to say too justly.—But
let us see this other letter, which bears the same date with the
rest.'</Q> 
<LETTER>
<HEAD>TO CHARLES HAZARD ESQ.</HEAD>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P> I know not, in this hurry of my spirits, if there be any
precedents in books of a wo∣man's writing to a man out of mere friendship; at
least of sufficient authenticity to warrant my disregarding decorum in
this manner. If there are not, it is a new incident, and I must rely on the
purity of my intentions to excuse it.</P>
<P> So extremely like a fairy tale, where the hero's bad genius
only makes its appearance, is all that has happened in this family relative to
you, that if I did not fancy I had myself sagacity enough to account for
the influence of the foul fiend, and whence it originates, I should think it
very hard indeed that people could not be contented with losing their own
senses, but they must insist that others lay aside theirs.</P>
<P><PB N="238" REF="240"/> That I may hasten through this
epistle sir—for I have a good deal to say—I am willing,
unfa∣shionable as it may be at our house, to do you poetical justice; not
however in the style of your good friends here, who, finding you in danger of
your life, think—in imitation of ARISTOTLE, RICHARDSON, and the barber's
uncle in <HI>Gil Blas—</HI>that they cannot excite in you too much
ter∣ror.</P>
<P> This candour in me does not proceed from any weak
compassion, but from a fair revisal of your actions at the time they
passed under my observa∣tion: and I do not think that charity
authorises me to look farther, at least with a severe eye.</P>
<P> Abiding by this mode of decision, common justice
obliges me to say that all your mad freaks here, which I would not have given
a farthing for you if you had been without, originated from wor∣thy motives.
Musquito, Ego, and even Too∣good smarted, it is true, but they highly
merited their punishment, and the lash was held by the hand of justice;
but think ye they forgot it in your absence? Oh no: scurvy fellows as they
are. Thank heaven, however, the worst of your enemies cannot give a bad
motive to your con∣duct <PB N="239" REF="241"/> in a certain instance. Yet
there are some who compare you to Lovelace, and call your treatment of Jude 
<Q REND="inline">"sparing your
rosebud:"</Q>—charming young man as you were, and I will believe
<HI>are.</HI></P>
<P> Judy daily blesses you, poor girl, and joins with me to
pray for the hard hearts that are set against you. Your behaviour as to her
began, continued, and ended critically right, and her virtue, as it ought, was
rewarded in the catastrophe; nor can a soul capable of such an act
indulge a single prin∣ciple that could dictate such dreadful crimes as we
are all commanded to believe against you.</P>
<P> As for my part, I have read so much that hu∣man nature is
a thing I am pretty well versed in. I must beg leave therefore to use my
own proper intellects, rather than those of others; for though I am devoted
to Sir Sidney, yet I am more so to truth and honour: and these wih not let
me see why nature should perform a miracle, by turning all those
excellent gifts she had afforded you into diabolical ones, merely for the
gratification of your enemies, and commiting a breach of promise, which she
was never known in any other instance to do.</P>
<P><PB N="240" REF="242"/> Your father was certainly greatly
shocked at not hearing from you; but if we do not admit all the rest, why
should we not charitably believe your letters have been intercepted. For my
part, I should think, if you had committed all this wickedness, you would
the sooner have written to him, if it had been only for the sake of
colour∣ing it. But poor man his behaviour was very strange towards the
last; yet you will find he could not bear to curtail you in your
circum∣stances.</P>
<P> As to the state of our family, it is briefly as follows:
Sir Sidney will not hear a word in your favour from any body; my dear lady you
know is the mirror of duty and goodness, and therefore if she have any
sentiments to your advantage she dare not divulge them even to me; charming
Annette, who—or our complicated history will be incomplete—must
marry you at last, is grown an angel, and I scruple not to tell you will
never love any body but yourself: but, dear creature, devoted to her duty,
how will she dare to look a stern father in the face, much less disobey
him; and, unfortunately, she is not Lady Roebuck's child.</P>
<P> I have not mentioned to you however all our 
<PB N="241" REF="243"/> family: Mr. Gloss I can assure you is no very
in∣considerable member of it. He has so pushed himself among the great,
that he is in parliament, and he has so attached himself to Sir Sidney,
that he is become his darling. He has certainly a knowledge of human nature,
but it is an artful one; for I can see plainly he has got round the good
gentleman by praising his ancestry, which we all know is his foible. They
have agreed to∣gether on making some motion relative to the an∣tiquities of
English baronets: then he has intro∣duced a number of improvements at
Castlewick, and put the people in a way of carrying the goods to market upon
much better terms than they were used to; which is all very good if his
motives were so: he has also been indefatigable in se∣conding Sir
Sidney's designs at Little Hockley, but how that will be now I do not know,
for your brother is beginning to settle grooms and others of his sporting
followers there.</P>
<P> Mr. Gloss, finding my partiality to books, thought he
knew where to find me vulnerable; but all his erudition was not able to cover
his de∣signs, which I could not however come into, for my studies have
never been subtilty, but nature. As to my sweet Miss Annette, he was
there en∣tirely at a loss, for she has no foible.</P>
<P><PB N="242" REF="244"/> Thus you see you have no friend but
me, ex∣cept Mr. Figgins, who, if the current account is to be credited, is
almost—for nobody it seems can be quite—as bad as
yourself.</P>
<P> Fear not however but some good will work out of this. I
shall be upon my guard, and I am very much mistaken if I do not know of
whom to be watchful. I only remark at present, that as it was said of
ALEXANDER the best trait in his for∣tune was the choice of his tutor, so I
most sin∣cerely believe that you would, at this moment, have been thought
immaculate if the same could be said, with the same truth, of yours.</P>
<CLOSER>
<SIGNED>I am, sir, Your very sincere friend, EMMA
DISTICH.</SIGNED> <POSTSCRIPT>
<P> P. S. I have this moment heard that your bro∣ther is to
be married in a few days, and that Mrs. O'Shocknesy, who assumes the
title of Lady Dowager Hazard, is coming to live with the happy pair.</P>
</POSTSCRIPT></CLOSER>
</LETTER></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'This girl,' said Figgins, 'with her
whimsical style, has more good sense than all of them put 
<PB N="243" REF="245"/> together. Her reading has been like the pro∣gress of a
bee; she has selected all the sweets, and left the poison behind: and
it proves that her in∣tellects are remarkably strong, for she seems to
have gathered as much mundaine knowledge by inference as others from worldly
commerce; and this is well exemplified in her being too cunning for Mr.
Gloss, who indeed seems to be the direc∣tor of this plot. I wonder upon
what terms he and the Lady Dowager are.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'She is a very good girl,' said Charles, 'and
I am afraid her solicitude for me will deprive her of her place.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'I fear so too,' said Figgins, 'for she
does not disguise that she dislikes Gloss, who will take ad∣vantage
of her being upon a false scent to get rid of her; for her suspicions
of Mr. Standfast, not∣withstanding his scandalous letter, are surely
ill grounded. This will be found out, and she will be turned away as a
mischief-maker. But for this mistake, the remarks in her letter would have
been very shrewd and sensible; but her dislike to Standfast is of
ancient date. He made pretty brisk love to her when he was in the family of
Major Malplaquet, and, upon her resisting his <PB N="244" REF="246"/>
inclinations, he did not place in her virtue that implicit belief that it
merited.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'I should think that would inspire her
con∣tempt,' said Charles, 'rather than her revenge. However, I cannot help
thinking as you do that Mr. Standfast has given no assistance to this
scandal but his belief of its truth, which cannot have failed to lend weight
and consequence to the opinions of the rest, both in regard to their
con∣viction that he is a judge of mankind, and that he must know me better
than any body. It only turns out that he does not know me at all; nay that I
did not know him; for I could not have thought it possible he could so
soon, nor with so much indifference, have dropt the mask of the kind
friendly adviser, to betray the insolent assuming pedagogue.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'My dear sir,' said Figgins, 'you will
please to recoliect that Mr. Standfast gets in years, which will not
lessen his pride, of which he has possessed a pretty liberal
quantity all his life, and you may be assured it is not diminished by a
recollection that he has a good five hundred a year settled on him for life;
which he ought, by the bye, to have the gratitude to remember belongs in right
to you. My two hundred a year comes from the same <PB N="245" REF="247"/>
source, and as we deprive you between us of a large unnual sum, it is but
common decency that we should shew a wish, even though we have not
ability, to deserve it.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Well,' said Charles, 'God knows how long I am
to live, but that I may not pass my life in an eternal warfare, I will not
investigate any thing: Time shall do it for me. There is but one
in∣ducement to my giving the matter a single thought, which is the
situation of Annette. How∣ever, all I can do actively in relation to her will
not only operate more to her disadvantage, but plunge me into real
wretchedness, which is a thing, I thank them all, full unpleasant enough
when one only possesses it in imagination. When my mind is more at
ease I may perhaps answer Emma's letter, but it will be only
strenuously to request she will not concern herself in my affairs at
all, and to make the poor creature easy, by tell∣ing her that I can smile
with contempt on all the malice of my enemies.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'And yet,' said Figgins, 'I cannot methinks
help wishing you would answer all the letters in the terms they
deserve.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Mr. Figgins,' inter∣rupted Charles, 'though, if
I know my heart, I should detest myself could I indulge for two mi∣nutes 
<PB N="246" REF="248"/> together an unjust or an ungenerous reso∣lution, yet
I am so well convinced that which I have at present made is founded on
reason and propriety, that I would lose my life rather than relinquish
it. No; they shall seek me, or they shall lose me. Let them take their
choice; and, if they do not care which, it would surely be greatly beneath me
not to be as indifferent as they are.'</Q></P>
<P>A summons to dinner put an end to this long conversation,
after which Figgins left his friend, in his miserable apartment, to go and
prepare the aw∣ful business of the next day. He was no sooner gone than
our hero began to pervade the contents of those letters which Figgins had
brought him from the bankers. First he selected those from his father,
which were filled with such tenderness, such distress of heart,
such sensibility, yet unmixed with a single reproach, that all poor
Charles's fortitude was nearly exhausted. He sighed, wrung his hands, and
cried like a child, which his gaoler—as he en∣tered his apartment to
examine if the rivets of his fetters were fast—mistaking for
apprehension on ac∣count of his approaching trial, begged he would make
himself easy, for he had nothing worse to apprehend than hanging!</P>
<P><PB N="247" REF="249"/> If this fate really awaits him, the
reader and I may hereafter make some enquiry concerning his behaviour; for,
as we have already examined toge∣ther his life and character, that same
behaviour and his last dying speech seems all that is wanting to wind up
his story. At present we are going into happier company, and if it be
objected against us that in so doing we are deserters to his cause
under whose banner we have inlisted, we must even excuse ourselves by
saying that we are not the only friends who have left a hero in prison, to
go over to his enemies.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER VIII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>A CLUE TO THE FOREGOING LABYRINTH.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>RETROSPECTION is a very good and a very neces∣sary thing. If
one's actions appear worthy upon a review, they will be a sort of security
for the future; if otherwise, their deformity being an unpleasant object of
contemplation, we may perhaps wish to replace it with something of a more
lovely appear∣ance: at least this will be the case with good minds. Some
men love singularity, others ugliness, and I sincerely believe it is in
some men's nature to love wickedness, and even wickedness in which no
plea∣sure can be enjoyed but the mere exercise of it. For my part, however,
I shall not here treat of such innate, undeducible affections, but
endeavour to give to a positive cause every little freak of fancy that the
personages in this history chuse to occupy their attention with.</P>
<P>A very extraordinary conduct has been lately ob∣served to
govern all the good people on this side of the water, ever since the reader
and I took leave of <PB N="249" REF="251"/> them, in order to accompany our hero
to France. What appears least reconcileable to credibility, is the alteration
of Sir Sidney, who, being a man of reason, of the world, of experience, of
conside∣ration, and of uncommon benevolence, one would naturally suppose
must, in a most extraordinary manner, have been tampered with before he
could have been induced to give up a young man in whose dawnings of maturity
he had taken abundant plea∣sure, whose father he had loved and honoured,
and of whose happiness he had hoped to have been the guardian.</P>
<P>Indeed when our hero left England Sir Sidney contemplated with
great pleasure when he should return, in the bloom of manhood, with all
those confirmed accomplishments so consonant to his rank and talents,
the reasonable delight with which he should witness an union between him
and his daughter, and as no one spoke of Charles but in a style of the
most exalted panegyric, no wonder if he was charmed at seeing every thing
and every body confirm such honest and legitimate senti∣ments. But, when
a week, then a fortnight, then a month, then two, then four, elapsed without
a single line from Charles to either his father, his mistress, or any
other friend, what could Sir Sid∣ney <PB N="250" REF="252"/> think? What
judgment could he form of those reports which continually assailed his
ears, and which seemed gradually to turn all his friends against him?</P>
<P>It may not be amiss to watch the progress of this
business. Zekiel, as the reader was long ago in∣formed, when he left Eaton
went to France. There being in very straitened circumstances, and totally
under the direction of Mr. Flush, he was obliged to practise many tricks
and shifts to get on, especially as Kiddy, who seems as a
manooverer—his own word—to be a twin-born with Standfast, very
carefully threw certain gentlemen depredators in his way, who are, as every
body knows, pretty plentiful in France, and who took care—his own
language again—to keep the purse, by sweating it, in good running
order.</P>
<P>Being very closely driven at Calais, and not hav∣ing enough of
Kiddy about him to distinguish be∣tween what the law calls theft, from that
which is so denominated by reason, he did that through in∣experience for
which he <HI>might</HI> have been hanged, when, in fact, his mode of policy
should have made him do only that for which he <HI>ought</HI> to have been
hanged.</P>
<P><PB N="251" REF="253"/> Mr. Dessein, however, who had his
policy too, as we have seen, did not chuse to expose him, and, by the
advice of his principal, he took care after∣wards, however he offended
against justice in a re∣ligious sense, not to sin against law.</P>
<P>From a variety of sources which Flush contrived to get
opened for him, Mr. Zekiel, together with his own income and what he could
drain from his mother, and indeed from Mr. Standfast, contrived to cut a very
capital dash at Paris. He set very large sums <HI>chez les
comptesses,</HI> and he betted larger upon the course of Fontainebleau.
In short, in spight of all he could amass together, honestly or
dishonestly, he would have found himself not only aground, but
surrounded with some very marked disgrace, if he had not met with a
gentleman who was so kind as to administer very largely to his wants; and
who, not contented with such liberal in∣stances of kindness to a perfect
stranger, gave evi∣dent tokens of satisfaction when the young lord in
expectation informed him he had a very tender af∣fection for his
sister.</P>
<P>This gentleman, the reader sees, was Mr. Tad∣pole. He had, it
seems, in company with the young lady we saw at Lisle, who was, to say
truth, not his sister—which circumstance indeed Mr. Fig∣gins's 
<PB N="252" REF="254"/> sagacity taught us to suspect
before—deter∣mined to make one bold push to render himself
in∣dependant. He had amassed at the gaming table in England about nine
hundred pounds, to which his reputed sister added thirteen hundred, which
she had won at a different game. Their plan was to snap up some young man
of good expectations, first supplying him with money, and afterwards with a
wife.</P>
<P>Tadpole, who was originally a lawyer's clerk, carefully
secured every step he took, and, by the time he reached England, had Zekiel
so completely in his power, that, being then of age, he scrupled not to
make over to his friend the reversion of a part of his father's terra
firma.</P>
<P>Coming so unexpectedly to his title and fortune, advantage was
taken of this power over him, and a marriage suddenly clapt up; not out of
fear of any reluctance in the young lord, but lest an old lady, one Mrs.
O'Shocknesy, should not only destroy the hopes of the young lady, by the
exercise of her power over him, but also those of the gentleman, by
fur∣nishing him with the money to pay off the mort∣gage.</P>
<P>This marriage, which Emma gave us a hint of, 
<PB N="253" REF="255"/> operated as we shall hereafter have occasion to
no∣tice, in a most extraordinary manner; but the bu∣siness at present
being to account for the reports against our hero, I shall go back to
Lisle, where the reader will recollect I entreated his particular at∣tention
to all that passed.</P>
<P>Our hero had never seen Flush, and the two bro∣thers were
so grown out of each other's remem∣brance, that it is not wonderful they
should remain in mutual ignorance till an accident unravelled the mystery.
After Zekiel had retired, vowing re∣venge, and left his brother master of the
field of battle, Kiddy, as we have seen, told him that re∣venge was very
easily in his power. He then in∣formed him of Madame St. Vivier's intention
to complete the happiness of Charles that evening, and shewed him a chamber
which he said and believed was hers. Zekiel, following the direction of his
trusty valet, was admitted to Kitty's bed room, and, in the full belief that
he was deceiving his brother, made as happy as he could wish.</P>
<P>The question here is, how came Flush, who was just
arrived, to know so well all these private mat∣ters? The answer is, by
Mrs. Kitty, who, toge∣ther with her mistress, had been as well instructed
<PB N="254" REF="256"/> upon this occasion by Mrs. O'Shocknesy, as Miss
Snaffle had upon a former one.</P>
<P>Flush, having the honour to know both the ladies, did not
scruple, when the squabble began between our hero and his brother, to
interrogate the waiting maid as to 
<Q REND="inline">'how the cat jumped,'</Q> as he called it, and,
having learnt from her the parti∣culars of the assignation, proposed to
put Zekiel in the place of Charles, which she promised, without intention
to perform; for she knew if it were de∣tected all their other designs on
our hero would be at an end; and, at the same time, she feared a
discovery from Flush, for indeed he menaced it, if she refused. She
therefore directed him to conduct Zekiel to her bed chamber, where he
passed the night, and the person who tapped at the door was Mr. Tadpole,
who having first knocked at his <HI>soidisante</HI> sister's, thought
he had mistaken the room, and afterwards went to his own bed, for fear of
fur∣ther mistakes.</P>
<P>So completely however were all these cross pur∣poses
acted, that Kitty believed the person who knocked at the door to be no other
than Mr. Fig∣gins, who, in his turn, as has been shewn, was otherwise
employed. Kitty, however, having given <PB N="255" REF="257"/> Madame St. Vivier
a hint of this business, she burnt a light in her chamber, by which means
Charles came, as he informed Figgins, at the certainty of his not being
mistaken.</P>
<P>The most awkward circumstance in this affair was the scene
which passed the next day in the post chaise between Zekiel and his two
companions.—Tadpole had taxed the young lady in the morning as to what
person was in her bed chamber; she as∣sured him it was the young lord;
they were there∣fore astonished that he himself dropt no hint of it,
while, on his side, he trembled for fear any one should have maliciously
discovered to them what he thought had really happened.</P>
<P>This doubtful taciturnity gave Tadpole a notion that he was
inwardly hugging himself at his success, and that probably having
stolen the possession of the young lady, he might, for some
reason or other, slacken in his devoirs for the future. Miss also had
suspicions akin to these, and she had once an idea of throwing
herself at her brother's feet, and mak∣ing use of this opportunity, through
his authority, of exacting from Zekiel a written promise of mar∣riage. She
refrained however, and it was well she did. Tadpole ventured a few hints. He
said he believed the devil had been let loose the night be∣fore 
<PB N="256" REF="258"/> in the inn, for he had heard such running about and
knocking at doors, that he could not get a wink of sleep. Zekiel blundered
out an awkward remark or two, Miss ventured at a few leading questions,
and, in short, they were all three on the verge of a discovery, which would
probably have overturned their respective intentions.</P>
<P>It happened however that but one discovery came of it, and
that was confined to the knowledge of Tadpole and the young lady. It was, that
some∣body had been in bed with Miss, which somebody was neither Zekiel
nor Tadpole. They therefore, for they had not an idea of Figgins, concluded it
to be Charles, and this thought dwelling in their imagination, presented
itself as a bar to their scheme. Upon a consultation on this subject
after∣wards, however, they resolved it should make no difference as to
their future measures, and their minds being thus made up—which the
reader will allow to be a pretty strong instance of delicacy—all
matters went in their former channel.</P>
<P>When they came to England it was agreed, on all hands, that Mrs.
O'Shocknesy and Standfast should know no more of Mr. and Miss Tadpole
than if there had been no such persons in the world.</P>
<P><PB N="257" REF="259"/> And now came, as Figgins called it,
master∣stroke the first. This gentleman corresponded with Mr.
Standfast, as did also Madame St. Vivier, whose real name was Jenny
Singleton, with Mrs. O'Shock∣nesy. From their accounts they had began to
frame an accusation, which the arrival of Zekiel greatly improved, and which,
with its amendments, stood as in Standfast's letter.</P>
<P>These tidings were conveyed to Mr. Gloss, who insinuated
them into Sir Sidney's family as oppor∣tunity served; and, as fast as one
rumour died away, he broached another, that the good baronet might not be
suffered to cool.</P>
<P>In this worthy business he found three very useful tools
in Musquito, Ego, and Toogood; who remem∣bering, as Emma has told us, their
old grudge—es∣pecially when revived in its worst lights by
Gloss—were continually throwing out some hint to Charles's
disadvantage. Musquito said the young fellow was mad, and because he
had been tolerably educated, and puffed up with false applause, had, like
other spoilt children, thought he could carry all the world before him.
Toogood said that he could not have believed a young man of such
pro∣mising parts would so disgrace all his friends, while 
<PB N="258" REF="260"/> Ego declared that if he had been a young fellow blest
with so many advantages, he would have turned out the best creature in the
world. In short, Gloss made them play fast and loose, as he pleased,
and when they talked in exaggerating terms of his former pranks, he once
ventured in a mild way to reprobate the part Sir Sidney had taken in the
busi∣ness of Swash and the taylor, saying he should not wonder to
hear his acquiescence upon that occasion quoted as an excuse for the
wretch's enormities.</P>
<P>These measures, together with the interception of Charles's
letters, which, by the bye, furnished Standfast, who received them, with a
most admi∣rable guide to the execution of his schemes, and now and then
some cursory intelligence from gen∣glemen just arrived from France, who
saw our hero drunk at an inn, or quarrelling in a coffee-house, where he
refused, notwithstanding their earnest solicita∣tion, to send any
letter or message to England. All these I say worked his utter ruin in
the opinion of his friends; and yet, I must do Sir Sidney the jus∣tice to
say he hesitated against what appeared to be positive conviction till
one morning news was brought that Lord Hazard was found shot through the
head, and that the act was certainly committed by himself, for one pistol
lay close by him, and <PB N="259" REF="261"/> another was found loaded in his
pocket; and they were the same pair he had bought when he was last in
town.</P>
<P>Two days after this melancholy accident John ar∣rived, who wept
over his old master's corpse, said he did not wonder at what had
happened, after∣wards corroborated all that had been reported, did not spare
Figgins, and concluded with an account of Charles's being imprisoned at Lyons
for murder, producing, at the same time, a French Gazette, which gave the
particulars of the whole transaction. Under these appearances, with Gloss
at his elbow, Sir Sidney wrote the letter we have seen.</P>

<PB REF="262"/>
<HEAD>CHAPTER IX.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>CONTAINING A RECEIPT TO FORM A GREAT MAN—A VERY CURIOUS
INSTANCE OF FILIAL PIETY, AND ANOTHER OF MATRIMONIAL COMFORT.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>HAVING formerly hinted that Mr. Gloss was se∣lected by
Standfast as a husband for Annette, and again in the last chapter shewn
that these two gen∣tlemen acted in concert in a fraud of no less
conse∣quence than what SHAKESPEARE, who well knew human nature, calls the
worst of injuries—the tak∣ing away a man's good name—I feel it
incumbent on me to account for the close intimacy which cer∣tainly did
subsist between them.</P>
<P>When Gloss came to England from Madeira, either accident, or
necessity, or something—for it is not necessary now to be
particular—pointed out Mr. Standfast as a proper person to
assist him in his views of settling in this country.</P>
<P>That reverend gentleman, ever ready to help out 
<PB N="261" REF="263"/> a genius—for this quality must be allowed to Mr.
Gloss—advised him to trump up a story of going to the Cape of Good
Hope, and then return, after go∣ing only to Madeira, where he actually had yet
some little business, and circulate a report that he had touched his
father's fortune, which, being in merchandise, he had only to change it into
money, to cut a figure.</P>
<P>Being introduced to a number of tradesmen, as a young nabob,
he presently sat himself down in a most elegant house, built a
<HI>vis a vis,</HI> and took up large quantities of goods: Standfast
supplying him with what ready money he was in absolute neces∣sity
of.</P>
<P>Cutting this figure, and having his pretensions backed by
Standfast, money was next borrowed, Snaffle and Dogbolt becoming
occasionally colla∣teral securities; and this trade went on so
swim∣mingly, that in less than a year and a half they found their names
standing out on different engagements for upwards of twenty-seven
thousand pounds! twelve at least of which Standfast had converted to his
own proper use: for the avarice of Mrs. O'Shocknesy was insatiable, and
the poor gentle∣man doated on her to a degree of infatuation.</P>
<P><PB N="262" REF="264"/> Thus situated, their ruin collectively
was inevi∣table, if they could not stem this storm, which now seemed to
be bursting over their heads. The diffi∣culty seemed to be how to manage
it, but to such geniuses all dangers were surmountable. Some hundreds
were laid out in India goods, to shew by way of sample, which were bought
for exportation, to save the drawback, and afterwards clandestinely
relanded.</P>
<P>Every possible exertion was made to give respon∣sibility
and consequence to the appearance of Mr. Gloss. A large estate was
bargained for; nay he even went so far as to wait on the minister, to offer
an exclusive treaty for a loan. Thus his name rang in the newspapers, and
the whole world, believing him to be in possession of an immense
for∣tune, offered him any assistance he might think proper to command.
Large sums were soon pressed upon him, which went to satisfy such
as would not shift the responsibility from his confederates shoul∣ders
to his. Others did not make any difficulty of doing this; so that after a
variety of negociations, Mr. Gloss's name stood alone for the original
sum of twenty-seven thousand pounds, and seven added to it!</P>
<P>What was the next step? How was he to go on 
<PB N="263" REF="265"/> How skreen himself from his creditors? How in∣deed,
but by borrowing the writings of a friend's estate, and standing for a
borough! He had given proofs of his abilities as a negociator; nobody knew the
theory of commerce better; who then so proper to fill an office under the
state?</P>
<P>He had fixed his eye on the treasury ship of the navy, and I
have said he had a knock of getting to any spot that he fixed his attention
on. A public acknowledgment that he was determined upon hav∣ing this post,
that is to say, whenever there should be a ministry virtuous enough for
him to mix with, gained him his election.</P>
<P>His speech from the hustings was very original, and
therefore very taking. In all addresses he had hitherto noticed, there were
a number of general promises, which were never performed. He, on the
contrary, resolved to promise nothing but what his constituents were
sure he would perform if he could.</P>
<P>He began with saying that he had an interest in offering
himself for that borough, and so had every man living when he made a
similar application; for would any one present, or in the world, exercise
<PB N="264" REF="266"/> his talents for nothing? This, he said, was ho∣nest,
and, therefore, he had no doubt it would be popular. He went on with saying
he had watched with great attention the unhappy situation of this country,
and was ready to lend a helping hand to save it from impending ruin. For this
however he certainly expected a reward: and it was but just. Would a
physician save a life without a fee?—or a parson a soul without
his tithes? It was folly, it was nonsense, it was hypocrisy, for men to
pre∣tend disinterestedness and mere love of their coun∣try. He loved his
country as well as any body; was as disinterested as any body; but still,
patrio∣tism and self-denial could not imply, in the pre∣sent instance,
more than this: that while loaves and fishes are going forward, a man
should eat only to satisfy nature, instead of guttling till he fur∣feited
himself.</P>
<P>He said he would be plain, and fairly lay open all his views.
The navy of this nation was its bul∣wark, its glory. It was that which lent
millions to our treasury, magnificence to our appearance, and terror to our
name. It was that which made us re∣spected and admired; dreaded and envied.
We made but a point on the face of the globe, but yet that point, though
small, was resplendant. It was <PB N="265" REF="267"/> gazed at with wonder
by the remotest corners of the earth. We were the true Cynosure of trade;
the commercial pole, that, with more than mag∣netic force, attracted the
interests of surrounding nations. All this was owing to our navy: the
pro∣tection of our commerce. His ambition therefore was to be treasurer of
that navy; in the execution of which office, though he expected to be paid for
his trouble, yet he would be bold to say his conduct would deserve it: for
he was sure he should save immense sums to the nation!</P>
<P>He said he despised professions. They were un∣manly,
ungenerous, and an insult to those to whom they were made: he had therefore
honestly opened his mind. That honesty would, he doubted not, be a
sufficient security with Englishmen, whose na∣tural character was
honesty, for his future good intentions. If he should have the great honour
to be returned for the borough of Bray, and a minister should come in of
sufficient ability and integrity for him to act with, he would stipulate
for the situa∣tion he had set his heart upon, and they would then see how
the money would be handled! He would be bold to say, though it would be for
his interest, it should also be for theirs: for the interests of the
member and his constituents were inseperable.</P>
<P><PB N="266" REF="268"/> He finished his speech with saying
he scorned to appeal to their ears, he hoped he had appealed to their hearts;
and as their own conviction must teach them that truth, and only truth, had
been his guide, he hoped that honesty, plain dealing, and unreserved candor
would mark that day as an epoch when a member of parliament was chosen who
had no expectations but from honour, no views but from sentiment.</P>
<P>I need not add that Mr. Gloss carried his elec∣tion; for
notwithstanding this florid speech, which was indeed novel enough, he had
bought the bo∣rough, and the gentleman who contested the elec∣tion was only a
nominal antagonist, set up to save appearances.</P>
<P>This point being carried, the person of Mr. Gloss was
sacred, and his creditors might go whoop for their money. Exasperated with
this treatment, his <HI>vis a vis</HI> was stopt in the street, and
executions served in his house. But this was as useless as the rest;
all his property was made over to Mr. Stand∣fast, for money lent. And now we
see Mr. Gloss without an inch of land he could call his own, nearly forty
thousand pounds in debt, with a house and an equipage made over for
safety to another, a parlia∣ment <PB N="267" REF="269"/> man, a popular
speaker, almost the leader of a party, and making large strides, with the
princi∣ples we have seen, towards a responsible and lucra∣tive place
under government: for the treasurership of the navy he was determined to
have.</P>
<P>As he really began to boast, and not without reason, of his
influence, he thought he could not attack Sir Sidney in a more vulnerable place
than his ancient house, which, from a long train of col∣lateral argument, he
proved to be older than the baronet himself had suspected.</P>
<P>I shall not go into the minutiae of this arrange∣ment, which
must not only be dry, but uninterest∣ing to the reader, who, I dare say,
would bate a little in the article of birth to such as made up the deficiency
in honour—but only say that Mr. Gloss made it out very clearly that
Sir Sidney was the only living issue of the family who held the honour of
the first English baronetcy, and offered to make a motion in the house,
which he should support with many powerful arguments, that his majesty be
advised to grant to Sir Sidney Walter Roebuck, and his heirs for ever, an
exclusive patent of baronetcy, under the title of baronet in chief, to be
considered as an honour between that of a common baronet and a baron, in like
manner as a marquis is considered be∣tween <PB N="268" REF="270"/> an earl and
a duke, and the precedent to be quoted, as an illustration of the argument,
was to be, that as there was but one real marquis—which was the case at
that time—so there should be but one chief baronet.</P>
<P>The baronet certainly listened to the proposal, and turned
it a good deal in his mind, and though he doubted whether he should avail
himself of such an opportunity of aggrandizing his
family—especi∣ally as he had no son—yet, as he could see
nothing but attention to his interest in the conduct of Gloss, he certainly
conceived from that moment a great re∣gard for him. This was prodigiously
augmented by the attention this last mentioned gentleman paid to
Castlewick, and the actual advantage its interests received from his
advice, which both gave the baronet an insight into his capacity, and
confirmed his good opinion of it. All these circumstances co-operating, as
indeed Emma has already told us, no wonder if he had familiar entrance to his
house, afterwards to his heart, and at length an offer of his alliance.</P>
<P>Mr. Gloss took care also to appear the friend of Charles;
but then his mediation never came with∣out an insinuation that he was more a
friend to ho∣nour. In short the two characters were so strik∣ingly
contrasted in the mind of the baronet, that <PB N="269" REF="271"/> without
any great stretch of propriety, the reader must allow, under these
circumstances, that it is not to be wondered he should turn about in the
manner I have described. Besides—for I would fain sum up every
trifling figure, to make the ag∣gregate of my reasons upon so important a
point convincing—Sir Sidney felt a delicate, a nice re∣pugnance, perhaps
too much so, at the idea of a connection with the son of a man who had
destroyed himself, and who had, assuredly, borne in his youth a very
bad character.</P>
<P>Again, he plainly foresaw that all his benevolent attempts at
Little Hockley would soon be frus∣trated by the innovations of the young
lord; for it was not yet so firmly rooted but that, owing to a new crew of
revellers, it began already to lose ground. This, and the recollection of the
ancient feuds, which he now feared would be renewed, heartily conquered his
inclination to be in any re∣spect allied to the family of Lord Hazard, though
he admired the talents of our hero, and really had such a value for him as to
wish his welfare, though he doubted whether he would ever deserve it.</P>
<P>Mr. Standfast and Mrs. O'Shocknesy must now become a
little the subject of our attention. That gentleman and lady had been
sometime married: <PB N="270" REF="272"/> but it was the wish of both that
it should not be pub∣lished. She brought with her a comfortable number of
debts, and being now a <HI>femme couverte,</HI> very soon contracted a number
more. In short, there were no bounds to her extravagance, which Mr.
Stand∣sast seemed as anxious to feed as she to indulge.—His own
income, including a living the gift of my lord, his annuity from that nobleman,
the interest of his legacy from Major Malplaquet, and what he had besides
been able to realize—for no object upon earth, except Mrs. O'Shocknesy,
had been sixpence expence to him—was about seventeen hundred a year;
the lady had three; yet we have lately seen above twelve thousand added to
their income in a year and a half! But what was this? He doated on her as
implicitly, as rapturously, and as boyishly as Barn well did on Millwood,
and threw large sums into her lap as willingly, whenever he could steal
them: for I think the means he used to get at them might very well be called
theft. On her side, no dutchess must dare to vie with her in taste and
ex∣pence. But every source from whence this profu∣sion was supplied at
length dried up. Mr. Gloss being in parliament, nobody would trust him; and
thus the whole credit of the confederacy was at a stand. Besides, Lord
Hazard, who was expected to grieve himself to death for the loss of his
wife and the irregularities of his son, was yet alive, and 
<PB N="271" REF="273"/> had no disorder but sorrow, which, though
immode∣rate, did not seem likely to kill him. What joy then to the heart of
this lady to hear he was no more!—to find her son in full
possession of more than thirteen thousand a year, the whole of which
she intended to command! Her transport knew no bounds! She bespoke a new
carriage and new liveries, and bowled down into Warwickshire in the most
superb and magnificent style that money could procure or fashion invent:
taking with her such domestics for her son as she conceived proper for
his situation in life. In short nothing could equal the triumph with which
she thought herself sure of taking possession of both her son's
senses and his affairs. Judge then what was her astonishment when
flying to his arms he stopt her by introducing his wife, being no other than
the very Miss Tad∣pole that Figgins, to use his own words, dubbed him with
by anticipation at Lisle! What then did she feel! Words are not strong
enough to describe her sensations. It took her breath away. She raved,
stampt, laughed, execrated, and would probably have died with the violence of
her passion, had not a shower of tears borne away the first torrent of
that complication of distressful feelings which assailed her. At length
she accomplished something like ar∣ticulate utterance, when the whole
school of Billings∣gate, had it been present, might have heard and 
<PB N="272" REF="274"/> edified. No opprobrious name that could be
scan∣dalously spoken or maliciously applied, was unre∣membered. His
lordship—surely no lord was ever so called before—was a
pitiful rascal, a nincompoop, a hop o' my thumb, a paltry puppy, and a
pimp∣ing scoundrel. The lady was a scurvy jade, a for∣tune hunting minx, a
low wretch, and a sorry trull.</P>
<P> Zekiel laughed at all the abuse on himself, but taking fire
at the insults offered to his wife, cried, 
<Q REND="inline">'I'll tell you what it is ma'am; I know you
see what you'd be at, but dam'me let me tell you dam'me that I am out of my
leading strings, dam'me if I 'ent, and I won't no longer be schooled, d'ye
see, by any old cat in England.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Old cat!' screamed out the lady
dowager.</Q></P>
<P>The young lady here interfered, and begged her husband to
consider he was talking to his mother.—
<Q REND="inline">'To my mother,' cried he, 'why so I know I am,
and a pretty mother she is, now is not she, to a∣buse you and I in this
here manner? Why I know'd what she was upon; she thought to come here and
be lady paramount of every thing, and snub and ding me about like a lout and
a school boy; but dam'me if I'll have any such doings: no, I won't old
gentlewoman, I'll assure you. I know in a week, if she was to be here,
she'd be <PB N="273" REF="275"/> whole and fole; nay I should not wonder if
she wanted at last to take my seat from me in the house of lords. But
hold, now I think on't she has been there once too often already.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'You brute!' exclaimed his mother. 'You
wretch!—you undutiful cursed devil! Oh I could tear your eyes
out!'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'I dare say you could,' cried the young lord,
'but I'll tell you what mother, if I am so unduti∣ful, you had better go away
from such a cursed devil, for to tell you the truth I never intended you
should live with my wife, seeing as how it was not unlikely you would
advise her to play me a trick or so with my <HI>valet de
chambre.</HI>'</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. O'Shocknesy could contain herself no lon∣ger: she ran
to his sword, and drawing it half way out of the scabbard, swore she
would murder him. Lady Hazard here screamed so loud that Tadpole, who had
been walking in the garden, came to their assistance, and demanded what
was the matter.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'The matter?' cried Zekiel; 'only my old mother
wants so send me post to the other world, <PB N="274" REF="276"/>
because I reminded her a little of the follies of her youth. God bless the
good gentlewoman,' add∣ed he, 'do now pray go home, wash the paint off your
saded jaws, and chuckle to old Standfast.—Why do you think I have not
been up to all the rum gig? Why yes I have; but it was no busi∣ness of
mine, you know, while I could coax you out of the ready. Now, d'ye see, I can
supply myself, and thanks to nobody:—so every one for himself,
and God for us all. Mr. Standfast has two or three goodish things: they may
keep you snug enough, if you have a mind to live pretty and decent, as an old
gentlewoman ought. As for me I intend to live nobly, and spend my money like
a man!'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'But still my lord,' said Tadpole—</Q>

<Q REND="inline">'Brother Tadpole,' interrupted Zekiel, 'I'll be
damned if I live in the same house with a wife and a mo∣ther, and there's
it d'ye see. That being the maxim of the thing, you had better, old lady, as
I said before, go back again; and it may be as well for you to keep a quiet
tongue, and advise Master Standfast to do the same, or it may be the
worse for both you, d'ye see, and the rum duke too.</Q></P>
<P>I have neither time nor inclination, nor indeed 
<PB N="275" REF="277"/> capacity to paint the fury of the lady, at her leaving
the house, which she did soon after. Every bitter wish her invention
could supply was lavished on her son. Among the rest, I think she
said she hoped to her soul he would be both a beggar and a cuck∣old.</P>
<P>The lady's return to Mr. Standfast, who was pre∣vented by
business from accompanying her into the country, was truly a curious one.
She blamed him for every thing, which was her usual method when∣ever any
thing miscarried; and he, as usual, bore his jobation with astonishing
coolness. This pro∣voked her: her passion then provoked him: one epithet
begat another, till he was all the old, sap∣less, doting idiots that her
fertile fancy could in∣vent; and she was, by his account, the damnedest
infernal hell-cat that ever was born to curse an un∣happy rascal like
him.</P>
<P>From storming they went to upbraiding then they proceeded to
the situation of their affairs, which were found to be plunged over head and
ears in difficul∣ties. This, in spight of them, brought on re∣flexion, and
that upbraided them with the infamous practices they had been guilty of to
serve an un∣grateful wretch, who, after he had mounted to af∣fluence by their
means, had kicked down the p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> 
<PB N="276" REF="278"/> that raised him! And here I cannot help remark∣ing
that the very devil for whom they had been so long toiling, his ends
accomplished, spit in their faces, and forsook them.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER X.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>IN WHICH MORE KNOTTY POINTS ARE CLEARED UP.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE reader will judge right if he fancies this re∣ception of
Mrs. O'Shocknesy was a concerted thing between my lord and his brother in
law, who was now his steward, as was Flush his butler. Indeed, as every
servant formerly in the house was by this time replaced by others, brought
in at the instance of these two friends, his lordship was doomed to be as
much in leading strings as ever his mother could have held him for the life
of her; but as he was suffered in every thing to have his own way, he did not
concern himself with what they did privately, but let them feather their
nests in quiet, under the idea of taking all his affairs off his hands,
because he was a man of rank, in whom it was vulgar to let business
interfere with pleasure.</P>
<P>Mr. Tadpole and Mr. Kiddy understood one another very well,
for the latter had, while they were in France, made a discovery, of which the
reader shall some time hence participate.</P>
<P><PB N="278" REF="280"/> A secret to a minister of state, or
his type, a great man's butler, is a matter of some consequence.—Here
then Flush set up his rest. It is true he ba∣lanced, when he first came
to England, and was within a hair's breadth of destroying all Tadpole's
hopes, by making the above discovery to his old master Standfast; but
that gentleman making him some proposal or other that he did not like, he
re∣tracted before he had so explained himself as to betray Tadpole, and
matters having since turned out so much to his advantage, he thanked his
stars that he had now sat himself down comfortably for life.</P>
<P>Whether Kiddy was tired of his youthful follies, or whether his
whirligig inclinations had wearied themselves with turning round, I know not,
but he seemed like a worn-out weathercock to be glad to rust where he had
stopt: and this choice was ma∣nifest in a total alteration in his manners.
He went to church, nay more, he was very often closeted with a methodist
preacher, with whom he got drunk, and sang psalms.</P>
<P> The young lord used to smoke this, as he called it, and
gave him many a dry rub, to one of which sallies he one day replied, 
<Q REND="inline">'Why Lord love your <PB N="279" REF="281"/>
lordship, my lord, when you come to repent, as I do, of all your worldly gig,
and are down upon the heavenly comfort of a religious life, you may tell the
old rum codger with his hour glass, come when he will, you are up to all he
knows, and in∣different, as some old learned gentleman says, whether you
close your peepers in sleep or in death.'</Q></P>
<P>Emma, who, as she informed our hero, was up on the watch, no
sooner heard of Kiddy's conver∣sion, but knowing he must be full of good
intelli∣gence for her, determined to tamper with him: not that she had any
expectation of finding him less a hypocrite in his new calling than in his
old one. She therefore saw there might be danger in putting her designs in
execution personally. In fact Emma saw herself of consequence in the
very way she had all her life wished to be; for she was convinced she
should have it in her power, in the language of those romances she so
dearly loved, to conduct two con∣stant lovers to the temple of Felicity,
through all the briars and bogs that impeded their passage.—Flush
she pitched upon as the vehicle in this trou∣blesome journey, which Swash
and his daughter were to guide, while she herself, like some tutelary
genius, should watch their motions, inspire them <PB N="280" REF="282"/>
with courage on the road, and remove all difficulties in their passage to
this desirable goal.</P>
<P>In less figurative language, she set Swash, who with
good reason loved Charles most sincerely, to insinuate himself into
Flush's good graces, who, I can tell you, had already began to love homage,
so little had the spirit mended his humility.</P>
<P>It was in the miller's instructions never to mention a word of
our hero, or, if he found that unavoida∣ble, to cover any suspicion of his
friendship, by railing against him, but at the same time to cherish all
that dropt from Flush—who now, for distinc∣tion, began to be called
Canting Kiddy—that could in the remotest degree lead to any
circumstance that implied a plot having been formed against him.</P>
<P>As to Jude, her part was a capital one, and had she not been
perfected in it by a very capable in∣structress, she might have spoilt
all.</P>
<P>Kiddy, it was notorious, loved a pretty girl; Judy was
instructed to throw herself in his way, to give an account of his
behaviour, and proceed step by step as she should be directed by Emma.
It was foreseen her virtue would be attacked, but this was 
<PB N="281" REF="283"/> the very cunning of the scene. Whenever this should
happen to be the case, she was directed to draw, in her simple way, a
pathetic picture of the wickedness of mankind, and lament the blindness of
the world, who could load the preserver of her innocence with unmerited
reproaches, while he who was seeking to destroy it had the character of
sanc∣tity and penitence. They were not so mad how∣ever as to trust to
Judy's prudence alone, nor her rhetoric, for force might overcome both: Swash
therefore was to be at hand upon any trying occa∣sion, to rescue her, which
being romantic, was still more to Emma's taste.</P>
<P>If she should get at any material evidence, her next step
was to strengthen her own weak force by the alliance, as she should think
fit, of either Mr: Friend or Mr. Balance, or both; and as she saw many
obstacles would lie in the way, particularly the business of Gloss,
she advised Annette to avow implicitly her affection for Charles, which her
fa∣ther had formerly authorised, and who would not so far contradict his
own excellent character as to in∣sist on her marrying one man before she
had forgot∣ten the other. Besides Mr. Gloss was not yet trea∣surer of the
navy, and therefore could not make those offers as to fortune which a man of
Sir Sid∣ney's <PB N="282" REF="284"/> rank and possessions would of
course expect, especially when he became chief baronet; which
circumstance, ridiculous as it was, really at times occupied his reflections:
for what man is there, let him be ever so good or ever so wise, but has
his weak side.</P>
<P>All this jumble or chaos of circumstances were fluctuating at
this time in Emma's head, out of which she had no doubt but she should
form a world of happiness for the young couple.</P>
<P>Matters being in this state as to our hero in En∣gland, the
reader and I will once more take a trip to the continent, in which journey we
cannot do better than follow the steps of Madame St. Vivier and her handmaid
Kitty, whose private motives being made clearer—which seems very
neces∣sary—this history will stand as disentangled as any one
could reasonably desire who wishes things to be brought forward in their
natural order.</P>
<P>It has been seen that I am not very fond of dwelling upon
trifling circumstances, I shall there∣fore, without mentioning a word of
these ladies bringing up, say that Madame St. Vivier was a fashionable
woman of the town, and that Miss Kitty, <PB N="283" REF="285"/> though her
handmaid, had been in no less a sphere of life than herself. Indeed, but
a very few years before, she had cut a figure little less brilliant than
Mrs. O'Shocknesy, but falling in love with either the beauty or the brogue of
Mr. Ireland, she had really attached herself to him with a singu∣lar
degree of constancy for a lady of her pro∣fession.</P>
<P>When this gentleman was obliged to abscond, in consequence
of his duel, he left his affairs in the hands of an intimate friend, who
thought proper to take no other notice of the trust, than by appro∣priating
every thing to his own use, without remitt∣ing his friend abroad, or allowing
the lady at home, a single sixpence: so that in this case Kiddy's
re∣mark of honour among thieves did not apply.</P>
<P>Mrs. Kitty having been sometime out of the way of
practice—for fashion has as much to do in these cases as
beauty—had recourse to her old friend Jenny Singleton, who began just
then also to be on the decline, and proposed a visit to Sedan, where Mr.
Ireland then was, with a view to consult him on their future operations.</P>
<P>This expedition was lucky enough, for Mr. Gloss 
<PB N="284" REF="286"/> coming across them, they were tutored by Mrs.
O'Shocknesy how to make their journey worth while.</P>
<P>Figgins gave them intelligence concerning the departure of
Charles; and, as it had been concerted, they met him at Dover.</P>
<P>The ladies however, determined to make all sure, had privately
agreed to act in the very manner Figgins has described; for their experience
gave them reason to believe that it was not impossible but Mr. Ireland
might forget to give them the meeting. They therefore were in appearance to be
alternately mistress and maid, both to save ex∣pence, to keep their
secrets to themselves, and also to avail themselves of any opportunity
that might happen of snapping up any English booby, by way of completing
his tour for improvement.</P>
<P>Matters turned out however very much to their satisfaction.
They met with Mr. Ireland at Se∣dan; he attended them to Nancy, where, as it
has been seen, he plundered our hero of a tolerable supply. Nor did he
absolutely part with them, but hovered about as it were, till his affairs
called him into Italy, to which place—after robbing our hero 
<PB N="285" REF="287"/> of every thing they could lay their hands on, as we
heard Figgins inform him—these two kind ladies followed him.</P>

<PB REF="288"/>
<HEAD>CHAPTER XI.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>A JESUITICAL EXPLANATION—THE SEPARATION OF TWO
FRIENDS—AND AN ANSWER TO EMMA'S LETTER.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IF the reader and I were unfeeling enough to leave Charles in
such a situation that death seemed almost desirable to him, Mr.
Figgins appears to have been more solicitous about him, for in less than
half an hour after the melancholy moment wherein I describe him reading his
father's letters, he re∣turned with great pleasure in his countenance, took
his friend by the hand, and giving him joy, told him he was liberated!</P>
<P>Charles, going from one extreme to the other, was enraptured at
the news, and requested to be in∣formed how so unexpected an event had been
brought about. Figgins answered him that they were in no place to satisfy
his curiosity. They were then joined by their attorney, who had stayed
be∣hind to pay the fees of the prison; and now the jailor, who a little
before had earnestly examined <PB N="287" REF="289"/> our hero's chains, to
see if they were fast enough, came with great ceremony to unfasten
them.</P>
<P>This and all other punctilios over, they sallied forth, and
Charles and Figgins being arrived at their inn, the latter thus accounted for
his friend's enlargement.</P>
<P>Mr. Figgins said that no single day had past since his
friend's imprisonment but some step had been taken to get at the truth of
the unhappy business, which had been the means of his suffering in so
worthy a cause. The accounts had been for a good while various and
unsatisfactory, and therefore he determined, as he had enough in all
conscience to vex him without being eternally tortured with such
suspense, not to say a word till some certain intel∣ligence should
arrive. He said the first clue he had of any thing like a chance of
success, though he took no notice of it at the time, was his friend's
saying he was sure he had somewhere seen the murderer. This put it into
his head—though he owned it was a conjecture greatly at random. 
<Q REND="inline">'But.' added he 'I would catch as much at a
straw for my friend's safety as my own. That Ireland, who was a great
duellist, was probably the man.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'And by heaven,' said Charles, 'I do believe 
<PB N="288" REF="290"/> he was; though it never struck me so till this
moment.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'You shall hear,' said Figgins.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'I was inclined the more to believe this on
hearing his name men∣tioned in an odd way by Madame St. Vivier, with whom I now
began to think he had maintained some intelligence all along; for I
recollected that it dropt from her at Nancy that she had seen him in
England. This set me upon interrogating Kitty, who confessed his having
been at Lyons, and that very probably he was the guilty per∣son.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'I was now convinced they knew it. Thinking
therefore to practise the trick your brother taught us at Lisle, I ordered
John to enquire every day at the post-office, and to bring me any letters
di∣rected to Madame St. Vivier. He, I suppose, made them acquainted with
these instructions, for after waiting till about three weeks ago, to no
purpose, I was just thinking what other method I could hit upon, when, all
on a sudden, the la∣dies and Mr. John decamped, as I imagined, to∣gether, but
we have since learnt he went to En∣gland.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Women cannot so easily travel secretly in
France <PB N="289" REF="291"/> as men. I therefore soon found out their route,
which, as I suspected, led to where Mr. Ireland was waiting for them. My
first intention was to have pursued them myself, but reflecting I
should be of more use to you upon the spot, I got, by the interference of
our banker, a very intelligent young man to go in my stead.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'The instructions given to this young man were
not to act so as to endanger Mr. Ireland—for that I knew you did not
wish—but only to get from him such sort of satisfaction as
should acquit you.—The first part of this injunction was
unnecessary, for though he overtook the ladies in the kingdom of France,
the gentleman was safe in the confines of Savoy. They however, fearing for
themselves, served him as a guide, and coming at length to where Mr.
Ireland had appointed them, he did you ample justice, making voluntary oath
that you had no part in the fray, but that of a mediator, and that so far
from having any malice, you could not possibly know either the quarrel or
its cause; for that all you did was merely the effect of acci∣dent, and
entirely with a view to prevent mis∣chief.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'This confession, so sworn—which
is now lodged <PB N="290" REF="292"/> to ground your discharge upon—he
accompanied with this letter, which you will find attributes the duel to the
hastiness of the gentleman who unfor∣tunately fell. He talks of
unhandsome reflections against Englishmen in general, and him in
parti∣cular. In short, be the cause of quarrel what it may, he had it in
his power to palliate the matter as he thought proper, for there are no
witnesses to contradict him.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Thus,' added he, 'my noble friend, you are at
liberty, and I offer myself to avenge you on your enemies in any way you may
think proper to point out for me.'</Q></P>
<P>Charles thanked him heartily, but said his only revenge would
be contemptuous indifference.</P>
<P>In some parts of this account Mr. Figgins ex∣ceeded the truth,
and in others fell short of it. He had not set John to enquire about
letters; he had not taken a hint from our hero as to Ireland; he had not wormed
the matter out of the ladies. On the contrary, a note had been received
explanatory of Ireland's flight on the very morning it happened, and the
intelligence had not been protracted out of tenderness to Charles, but to
cover the safety of the sugitive; for though a gentleman was sent, as 
<PB N="291" REF="293"/> our hero was informed, and did actually return with the
letter and oath already mentioned, yet Madame St. Vivier, who, to do her
justice, was as willing as any body to save Charles, stipulated however
that no arrangement should take place till Mr. Ire∣land should be fully out
of danger. Then again there was no part of the conduct of these ladies
un∣known to him. He knew why they went to Sedan; he was accessary to the
loss of the money at Nancy; he even learnt that Kitty and Ireland were upon
the best terms; he consented when they went away to their taking that money
of which he pretended to have been robbed; and, lastly, so far from not
be∣ing acquainted with John's departure for England, he sent him there,
and—not to hide the truth—with proper instructions how our hero
should be written to: so that he knew every word of Mr. Standfast's
letter before Charles received it.</P>
<P>Mr. Figgins now began to be very inquisitive as to our hero's
future plan. Charles said he should immediately write to Mr. Balance, and
if he found him willing to supply him without the ceremony of going to
England, he should continue his tour as he originally intended; 
<Q REND="inline">'for,' said he, 'I see nothing in my native
country that should make me desirous of returning to it.'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="292" REF="294"/> 
<Q REND="inline">'Nor I either,' said Figgins, 'except it were
to curse them all round.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Pretty advice indeed,' said Charles, with a
laugh: 'want a man deliberately to go seven hun∣dred miles for no better
purpose than to put him∣self in a passion.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Well then may I be damned,' said Figgins, 'if
I think there is your fellow upon the face of the earth. Such prudence and
discernment at your age is truly astonishing.'</Q></P>
<P>The reader sees that Figgins did not want Charles to go to
England, but as he well knew the right kind of argument to hold with mankind,
the stronger Charles's obstinacy appeared, the more he argued against it.
He shewed how easy it would be to un∣deceive Sir Sidney. He painted the
beauties of Annette; the danger of losing her; the triumph of obtaining her
from his rival; till at length, being highly exhilirated with wine, he had
reason to re∣pent of his warmth, for Charles, in the heat of his vivacity,
said something that implied a determina∣tion to return.</P>
<P>Fortune however, envious perhaps of his having so narrowly
escaped an untimely end, or thinking <PB N="293" REF="295"/> the hero of
such a history as this had not been long enough upon his probation, or bent
upon bringing about his catastrophe, whatever it be, by the means of Mrs.
Emma, her agent, or for some other equally wise and considerate motive,
determined to give Charles good time to deliberate, before he should come to
any resolution; for he was that night taken with a violent fever, which
lasting him several days without the smallest intermission, and
several weeks with but very little, he was at length left in a most
emaciated condition, with all the symptoms of a gradual decline.</P>
<P>The moment he was able he wrote to Mr. Ba∣lance, without however
dropping a hint of his ill∣ness, which precaution he enjoined Figgins also
to observe, thinking, probably, it would look like an overture to a
reconciliation, which, had he even wished, his pride would have forbid him to
ac∣knowledge.</P>
<P>Indeed he was pretty resolute as to his future in∣tentions;
for though his bodily strength was greatly impaired, his mental faculties
were at least as strong as ever.</P>
<P>This was the only serious illness he had ever had in his
life. It had given him excellent time for re∣flection, <PB N="294" REF="296"/>
and the more he reflected the less he saw to be ashamed of. In proportion
therefore as he found himself wronged, he persisted in his firm
de∣termination to consider himself independant, and accountable to no man
for his actions: and, as to enjoy the full possession of such
principles he must not have many friendships, he resolved to continue his
tour, that, by gathering a plentiful stock of ac∣complishments, he might be
the better qualified to find a friend in himself.</P>
<P>This scheme he was also determined to pursue after his own
fancy, which part he digested as de∣liberately as the rest. Taking
therefore an oppor∣tunity one day, when the physician advised him to try
the air of Montpelier, he thus opened his mind to his friend Figgins.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'My dear sir, it would be but a poor return to
your warm and unshaken friendship, merely to say it will ever be
remembered by me with that sort of heart-felt pleasure every thing gives me
that originates from such handsome and liberal principles. It would however
be taking a very unfriendly advantage of you if I could be so un∣reasonable
as to requite so much generosity by suf∣fering you to neglect and injure
your affairs on my account.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="295" REF="297"/> 
<Q REND="inline">'My father has settled on you an annuity, to
which is now annexed no conditions on your side of attention to me; for he
being dead, his kind∣ness must naturally be considered as a remem∣brance
of past, instead of a reward for present, services: but as I know your
worthy heart will not let you regard yourself as entitled to this es∣teem,
unless you acquit your conscience of re∣ceiving it upon any other principle
than that of desert, instead of throwing away your time on me—time
which, at your season of life, must be very precious to you, and which
you can without doubt employ to greater advantage in the bosom of your family
and affairs—you shall keep a con∣stant correspondence with me, and
I will promise to profit by that advantage as much as my capacity and
abilities permit me: so now do not take it unkind that I should have
resolved to pursue my travels alone, but rather let me have your excuse
that I have already taken up so much of your time, to your
prejudice.'</Q></P>
<P>It happened luckily for Mr. Figgins, that this was the very
subject he had himself been two or three times on the point of broaching,
but he felt so awkward about it that he could not for the soul of him tell
how to begin. Having however the ice broken for him, he did not scruple to
acknowledge <PB N="296" REF="298"/> that his affairs at home were rather in a
disordered condition, and that he sincerely believed, were he on the
spot, a certain bishop would at that time have an opportunity of promoting
him: but yet he could not think of leaving his dear, his honoured friend; it
would look as if he was of a piece with the rest of the world, and had
basely deserted his cause.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Your own heart and my experience of your
ge∣nerous friendship will, my dear Figgins,' said Charles, 'acquit you;
for, after all, what signifies what all the world says abroad, when you
have a cheerful monitor at home that approves your ac∣tions. Beside, in the
opinion of those who take the freedom so very liberally to talk of me, you
will retrieve your character instead of injure it, by quitting a man so
unworthy to be spoken well of.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Rather,' said Figgins, if I am induced to
leave you, let it be with a view to confound any rascal who shall dare to
use you ill. Now I think of it, you have need of a friend there to silence
your calumniators, and I assure you neither Mr. Stand∣fast, whose
friendship it is my intention to re∣nounce, Mr. Gloss, your brother, nor
even Sir Sidney, shall dare to traduce your character with 
<PB N="297" REF="299"/> impunity.'</Q> To which Charles said, 
<Q REND="inline">'Figgins, if you would have me believe you value
either my friendship or peace of mind, imitate what I should do in the
same situation. When you hear any one vilify me, laugh in his face, without
lifting him into consequence enough to think him worthy an answer.'</Q></P>
<P>After a great deal of persuasion on one side, and much
apparent reluctance on the other, it was a∣greed upon that our hero and Mr.
Figgins should part. This they did with many warm protestations of
friendship, and future attention to each other's interest—on one
side I am sure very sincere—and a firm promise to keep up a
regular correspon∣dence.</P>
<P>Not two days after the departure of Mr. Fig∣gins, Charles wrote
to Mr. Balance, by whom he had been treated, as to his money, in a very
gen∣tlemanly manner, desiring, without giving a single reason, that he
would immediately grant out of his fortune a hundred a year to Mr. Figgins for
life; and about four hours after this letter was dispatched, he received one
from Emma, informing him of his brother's actual marriage—and also that
Lady Ha∣zard was in a way to bless him with a son and heir—the
discomfiture of the Lady Dowager; the unal∣tered <PB N="298" REF="300"/>
inflexibility of Sir Sidney; the neutrality of Lady Roebuck; the constancy of
Annette; a con∣gratulation on his release, which they had all heard from
some spy in the camp; to which she added, pray God Mr. Figgins prove not
rather an Euris∣teus than a Pylades; a gentle reproach for his si∣lence; an
exhortation to return; 
<Q REND="inline">'but indeed,' said she, 'to what purpose?
Justice, come as am∣ply as it may, can now scarcely make you amends. Of
what use was the pyramid to Aesop after they had hurled him from the
rock?'</Q>—and lastly, she informed him that she had a most
formidable plot, which had already taken root, and when it should have grown,
blossomed, and borne fruit, she doubted not but she should gather a
plentiful crop of justice to him, credit to herself, conviction to the
abused, and confusion to his enemies.</P>
<P>Charles had not answered Emma's former letter, it is true, but
he was determined now to do so once for all. This was his letter. 
<LETTER>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>MY GOOD EMMA,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P> Your attention to me, to speak in your own way, is a
panegyric on yourself, and a lam∣poon <PB N="299" REF="301"/> on those
around you; for even though I should deserve all they have so very
liberally laid to my charge, a little charity one should think would not do
them any harm. But I see the con∣federacy is strong, and had I the shadow
of a wish to break it up—which I really have not—it would, I dare
say, be no easy matter.</P>
<P> Your information, as to your sweet young lady, is very
flattering, and, at any other time, would have been very delightful; but why
should I pur∣sue what I can never arrive at: since the folly of her own
family has made an union between us im∣practicable? Be therefore, good
Emma—for upon my soul you are really a good creature—a friend to
her, and instead of filling her ears with imagi∣nary happiness, which she
can never enjoy—re∣commend to her an observance of her duty, by which
she will no doubt more fully accomplish all her wishes. You will the more
readily induce her to this by assuring her, which you may with great truth,
that whatever may have been my sentiments, I am determined not to think of
her in future.—Indeed my intention, and that for many reasons, is never
to see her again, and without any ill com∣pliment to your literary wisdom,
I must say you are a dunce if you do not see why.</P>
<P><PB N="300" REF="302"/> As to Sir Sidney and the rest of my
formidable accusers, I will not take the trouble to care what they think of
me; for, though I heartily forgive them—though I think pity is the
properer word—and would do them any service I honourably
could—but I believe they think mine rather a shabby kind of
honour—yet the world should not purchase from me a grain of
friendship for them.</P>
<P> And now Emma, as you are so kind as not to think me quite
the hang dog they have painted me, do pray believe that what I have said
above was dictated by sincerity; and, this admitted, your understanding
will tell you that I shall be insen∣sible to all persuasion; for you
see, by my deli∣beration, that these resolutions are not the ca∣price of
a moment. Seeing this, it will also strike you as repugnant both to your
safety and my ho∣nour—which you know it would be a terrible thing not

reasons will shew you the necessity of dropping your plot. No, my

to SHAKESAEARE—for you love a quo∣tation—

<HEAD>CHAPTER XII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>CONTAINING AN EVENT WHICH, HOWEVER SAGACIOUS THE READER MAY
BE, WILL NOT BE ANTICIPATED.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>CHARLES continued in a very weak state. As soon therefore as
he had received from Mr. Balance such kind of authority as enabled him to
find him∣self in cash, travel where he might, he complied with his
physician's advice, and removed, by short stages, to Montpelier, with
only a <HI>valet de chambre</HI> and a <HI>laquais,</HI> both Frenchmen: his
intention be∣ing to shun the English as much as possible.</P>
<P>His disorder for some time gave every appear∣ance that if
the malignity of his friends went so far as to wish him in the other world,
they would soon be satisfied. Perhaps some of them might have been happy
to have contemplated his situation.—Their charitable expectations
however would have been disappointed, for his youth and constitution
triumphed over the consumption, and, what per∣haps was a greater victory,
over the united efforts of the physicians; and at length—but not in
less <PB N="303" REF="305"/> than seven months—his recovery was
pronounced to be certain.</P>
<P>I might here draw a striking picture enough of a young man of
rank and fortune, with excellent talents, an admirable heart, young,
handsome, and sweet tempered, without a single fault that might not be
defended upon principles of reason, hemmed in by an host of enemies, and
apparently dying by himself in a remote corner of a strange kingdom. All
this interspersed with apt observation, and em∣bellished with proper
reflections, would indeed make up good moral matter in this place, and give me
an opportunity of finishing the second volume with some very pretty,
round, well-turned reading:—but the business of this history
is—as indeed I think every other ought to be—action, which I give
the reader warning will be more and more rapid as we go on. I therefore beg,
that whoever shall wish I had paused at such and such a place, and
given my muse a bait, cramming down every mouthful with a moral sentence,
will supply that sentence them∣selves, which will be more than one
advantage to me: it will save me the trouble; it will be more to the taste
of every reader; and it will give free scope to all those who think with
me, to go on without skipping.</P>
<P><PB N="304" REF="306"/> Charles did not want company at
Montpelier, for he did not want money. He had officers and abbes out of number,
and sometimes ladies, and now and then an English gentleman in misfortunes,
who was not the worse for his trouble in visiting him. At other times he
read the best authors, and never lost any opportunity of speaking French,
which he at last accomplished correctly and elegantly.</P>
<P>His health was re-established sooner than his strength.
On this account he slowly visited most of the towns in the south of
France, where he met with a variety of characters, with whose histories,
were I so disposed, I could interlard my book, till, as I once heard an
Irishman say of a bad play, the main plot would be all episode. I shall
however, which is modest enough, chuse but one, and now we are talking of
Irishmen, it shall be a gentleman of that country; he shall be a monk,
called Father Fitzgibbon, and member of a convent of Benedic∣tines.</P>
<P>Our hero, because perhaps he was in a wine country—for
sick people are very whimsical—took it in his head to long for some
beer; an inclination however he did not seem likely to gratify, for en∣quiry
had been repeatedly made for that beverage to <PB N="305" REF="307"/> purpose.
His valet, who had a most indulgent master—and they say a good
master makes a good servant—determining not to give the matter up
quietly, procured intelligence that about two leagues off there was a convent
of English, Irish, and Scotch, where, for their own use, they brewed
excellent beer. To this convent, without saying a word to Charles, he
posted. Having told his story, he re∣ceived for answer, that they brewed
the beer for their own use, as he had heard, but, nevertheless, if upon
paying them a visit they should like the gentleman, they would supply him
with as much as he could drink. A card to this effect was dis∣patched,
inviting Charles to dine with them the next day. He obeyed that summons and
several others, till, what with the beer, the good company, and the ride,
which I believe had most merit—as the air in Wales performs that cure
which the phy∣sicians attribute to the goat's milk—in a short time he
found himself in perfect health.</P>
<P>I should not have mentioned this circumstance so minutely
had I not designed to introduce Father Fitzgibbon, who was superior of this
convent, to the reader, and I should not have introduced Fa∣ther Fitzgibbon
to the reader if I had not had a material reason for it.</P>
<P><PB N="306" REF="308"/> This friar was, as I have said, a
native of Ireland. He was of a good family, but being a younger bro∣ther, he
quitted Dublin and went to Bath—the usual market—in search of a
fortune. There he contrived to lodge in the same house, where lodged also
an ancient lady and her daughter, the widow and heiress of an old hunks, who
had amassed a large fortune by boiling blubber at Deptford. It was
immaterial to him which he married, but he was determined upon one of them, and
that one should be her who was richest. This his intelligencers in∣formed
him was the daughter, who being very ig∣norant and conceited, and besides
beset hard, yielded upon easier terms than marriage, which conditions the
Irishman did not boggle about, because for why, said he, 
<Q REND="inline">'sure can't I make you very happy after I have
ruined you for ever.'</Q></P>
<P>The appointment being made when and where this forward young
lady, for the first time, was to yield up the possession of her
person to her intended husband, Fitzgibbon, which is not extraordinary in
an Irishman, made a blunder; for, mistaking his way, instead of Miss's
room, he got into her mam∣ma's, who expected a gallant likewise.</P>
<P>Before the morning they discovered their mutual mistake, and
before the next morning Fitgibbon, <PB N="307" REF="309"/> prevailed on the old
lady to rob the young lady of her fortune, with which they set off for
France, and of which money, three years after, when this antiquated Venus died,
he had just enough left to purchase a commission in the Irish
brigades. To be brief: After much riotous conduct, and many misdemeanours, he
was broken, when the church,—which is in France something like what we
say in England of the sea and the gallows—received him.</P>
<P>He had been superior of this convent of Benedic∣tines four
years, and at the end of three more he was to visit his own country for a
twelvemonth, when he assured our hero he would spend a month with him in
England.</P>
<P>For a few hours, at a time of vacant hilarity, Charles could not
be in more agreeable company. He laid himself out for their convenience,
sent them several desirable presents, and left, at his departure, a
handsome donation, which Fitzgibbon did not scruple to tell him, in a
whisper, should be laid out in excellent claret.</P>
<P>Charles had stayed so long in France that the time was now
nearly arrived which he had intended to have apportioned to his whole tour: for
his promise to his father had been to return in time to pass his birth∣day 
<PB N="308" REF="310"/> with him, when he should have attained his one and
twentieth year. He therefore determined to go back to England, in order to take
his affairs into his own hands, after which, if he should feel himself so
disposed, he might then be in time to make his tour of Italy; for so far
from having any body to con∣trol him, he did not think there were six
persons upon the face of the earth who cared three-pence about him. In this
mind he set out, with a view to stay a month at Paris, and then jog on
leisurely for England. He arrived at Aix la Chapelle late in the evening,
where he supped, and then ordered post horses to be ready the next
morning. The house seemed to be very full of guests, and just as our
hero got into bed, they were reinforced by a compa∣ny from the play. Charles
had been dropt asleep about an hour, when he was, all on a sudden, awoke by
a violent screaming. For a moment—which is very natural in a strange
bed—he knew not where he was. Recollecting himself however, he hurried
on his breeches and slippers, and throwing a morning gown over him, took his
sword, and darted from his own chamber to that from whence the noise
issued. The door was locked, but he burst it open with his foot, and
immediately saw a French officer strug∣gling with a young lady, who still
shrieked with all her force. With the hilt of his sword he struck the
ravisher in a moment to the ground, then placing <PB N="309" REF="311"/>
himself between him and the young lady, he stood ready for him, in a
posture of defence, against he should attempt to rise. At the moment he
placed himself in this attitude, rouse reader your whole
at∣tention!—exert your whole stock of penetration!—prepare for a
most unlooked-for surprise!—yet, let it be ever so great, it
cannot be any thing equal to that of our hero, when, on looking towards the
door, he saw several persons enter the chamber, and, among the
foremost, Sir Sidney, Lady Roebuck, and Emma!</P>
<P>Reader, it was Annette herself whom Charles had rescued from
a ravisher!—who having in the fifteen months that he had been absent
ripened into wo∣man, and improved in every limb and feature into more
perfection than ever was described by the ablest pen or correctest
pencil; nay had the best poet or painter that ever wrote or drew seen her,
like our hero, at that moment, and even felt the same cap∣tivating
sensation from the astonishing power of her irresistable charms,
then so greatly heightened, still must a description of them have been
incomplete: for neither are there words nor colours strong enough for the
task. Charles, though he had but a mo∣ment, which was imperfectly lent him by
the rela∣tive intelligence received from seeing who entered the room, in that
moment gazed away his soul; <PB N="310" REF="312"/> his very brain received
the whole force of her in∣comparable attractions, and love took triumphant
possession of him.</P>
<P>During this interval, short as it was, the officer had got up,
unseen by our hero, and was coming to∣wards him. This constrained him to
transfer his attention from the lady to the gentleman. He asked, in a firm
voice if he dared justify his conduct; to which he was answered, 
<Q REND="inline">'No sir; it was unpardona∣ble. It was wine, it
was distraction! I have suf∣fered an ignominious blow, but I deserved it,
and you are a stranger. No sir, I shall ask for no sa∣tisfaction; for
light and blameable as I may have behaved, though my existence depends on my
courage, and the sword is my profession, I dare not draw it in a
dishonourable cause.'</Q></P>
<P> Sir Sidney, who at first thought very differently of this
business, especially when he heard Emma exclaim as they approached the
chamber, 
<Q REND="inline">'Oh Christ, there is Mr. Hazard!'</Q> felt,
from the strongest conviction, a warm glow of gratitude to∣wards our hero.
This however was a little checked by reflection, as well as a contemplation of
what Charles was then doing, who, forgetting there were a number of
spectators present, stood like a statue, devouring with his eyes the
beauty of Annette, <PB N="311" REF="313"/> which was now heightened by
conscious innocence and thankful pleasure. In this short interval,
dur∣ing which Sir Sidney deliberated, Annette was mo∣destly delighted, Emma
hugged herself, and our hero was fascinated, in came to their relief Mr.
Gloss, who being in a few words informed of the business, went up in a
style of the greatest familia∣rity to Charles, and seizing him by the
hand, cried out, 
<Q REND="inline">'My dear sir, how do you do? I thought you
were in Italy. For God's sake why don't you let your friends hear from
you?'</Q> Charles flung from him in great indignation, saying, 
<Q REND="inline">'I don't know you sir,'</Q> and was making
towards the door, but Sir Sidney, who could not bear to receive a service of
such magnitude without noticing it, stopt him, saying, 
<Q REND="inline">'I cannot refrain from warmly acknow∣ledging
this unexpected kindness, which has been as bravely and gallantly, as
disinterestedly, shewn me. You know Mr. Hazard I have a warm heart, and a
generous action touches it; therefore, this of yours, which has probably
saved my honour, I shall not, you may be assured, think lightly of; and
if—'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Surely,' said Charles, recovering himself
into a complacent, yet erect dignity, 'you jest Sir Sid∣ney! What I have done
is at best but a common duty, which requires no partial thanks, because 
<PB N="312" REF="314"/> the greatest stranger would have been equally
en∣titled to it. But how do you know it was not the act of one ravisher
anxious to defeat the de∣signs of another? I dare say it will have that
colour by to-morrow morning. In the mean time you shall be assured I am
honest in something, nor will you doubt it when I tell you that what∣ever
motive induced me to that which has pre∣served Miss Roebuck's honour to her
family, it was not friendship to her father: and so sir, good night to
you.'</Q> So saying, he bowed respectfully to the ladies, and left the
room.</P>
