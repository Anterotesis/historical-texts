<P>A SACRED POEM.</P>
<Q><L>HONOUR and Shame from no Condition rise;</L>
<L>Act well your Part, there all the Honour lies.</L>
<L>Fortune in Men has some small Diff'rence made,</L>
<L>One flaunts in Rags, one flutters in Brocade.</L>
<L>The Cobler apron'd, and the Parson gown'd,</L>
<L>The Friar hooded, and the Monarch crown'd.</L>
<L>"What differ more (you cry) than Crown and Cowl?"</L>
<L>I'll tell you, Friend: A Wise Man and a Fool.</L>
<L>You'll find, if once the Monarch acts the Monk,</L>
<L>Or, Cobler-like, the Parson will be drunk,</L>
<L>Worth makes the Man, and want of it the Fellow;</L>
<L>The rest is all but Leather or Prunella.</L>

<LG>
<L><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> SING the Causes of a Troubled Reign,</L>
<L>Pleasure how great, how permanent is Pain;</L>
<L>Reason unthron'd, rebellious Passion's Sway,</L>
<L>The fatal Produce of a Lustful Day:</L>
<L>The ANOINTED HEAD how vicious Joys expose,</L>
<L>A Soul in Anguish, and a King in Woes.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>LIGHT Spots on <HI>Ermin</HI> are conspicuous shewn,</L>
<L>And doubly glare the Follies of a Throne.</L>
<L>How then Thy Crimes, O DAVID! shall we scan?</L>
<L>Thou greatest Monarch! Thou most God-like Man!</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="5"/>Or how the Frailty of our Frame confess,</L>
<L>When GOD's distinguish'd Fav'rites thus transgress?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THE <HI>Sun</HI> adown the Steep of Heav'n had roll'd,</L>
<L>And fring'd the purple Clouds with Skirts of Gold,</L>
<L>When shunning Grandeur, and the Noise of State,</L>
<L>On the High Turrets of the Royal Seat,</L>
<L>DAVID the Sweets of deep Rebellion sought,</L>
<L>Indulging all the Luxury of Thought.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>ON <HI>Sion</HI>'s Mount the Cedar-Fabrick stood,</L>
<L>The ruin'd Honours of the <HI>Tyrian</HI> Wood.</L>
<L>Hence stretch'd his Eye around his large Domain,</L>
<L>And much he joy'd him in his ample Reign;</L>
<L>Pleas'd cou'd the Present with the Past compare,</L>
<L>The Regal Glories with the Rural Care:</L>
<L>The Rural Care fair <HI>Bethlem</HI>'s Hill renew'd,</L>
<L>Which gently rising in the South he view'd.</L>
<L>Life's Steps from that distinguish'd Day could trace,</L>
<L>When, tho' the youngest of the Sons of <HI>Jesse,</HI></L>
<L>He first was destin'd by the Sacred Oil</L>
<L>To splendid Cares, and Eminence of Toil.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>HOW did He once the <HI>Bear</HI> and <HI>Lion</HI> slay,</L>
<L>While yet a Swain, to save the fleecy Prey!</L>
<L>At <HI>Elah</HI> how a Beardless Stripling dare</L>
<L>The grim gigantick Terror of the War!</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="6"/>Harsh whiz'd the <HI>Sling,</HI> and with a thund'ring Sound</L>
<L>He fell enormous o'er a Length of Ground.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>AND now resolv'd He, as new Scenes he chose,</L>
<L>How still new Labours, and new Dangers rose.</L>
<L>To Envy doom'd a Sacrifice to fall,</L>
<L>How twice he 'scap'd the vengeful Hand of <HI>Saul;</HI></L>
<L>And how he foil'd the proud <HI>Goliah</HI>'s Arms,</L>
<L>To merit <HI>Merab</HI>'s falsely promis'd Charms.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>HE next the Wonders of his <HI>Sword</HI> admir'd,</L>
<L>When gayly bold, by <HI>Michal</HI>'s Beauty fir'd,</L>
<L>Two Hundred Foreskins of the Foe he paid;</L>
<L>A double Dow'ry for the Royal Maid!</L>
<L>The Royal Maid the daring Youth approv'd,</L>
<L>Met her new Lord, and unreserv'd She lov'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>NOR yet was the relentless Father won</L>
<L>By the True Subject, or the Duteous Son.</L>
<L>The thirsted Blood still sought he to attain</L>
<L>By Fraud, by Force; but Fraud and Force were vain.</L>
<L>The faithful <HI>Michal</HI> bad her Spouse depart,</L>
<L>Mourn'd him as Sick with all the Woman's Art,</L>
<L>But thro' a Window secretly convey'd,</L>
<L>To seek at <HI>Ramah</HI> Holy <HI>Samuel</HI>'s Aid.—</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THENCE fled He, the Devoted Life to save,</L>

<L>He sought Protection in the Land of <HI>Gath.</HI></L>
<L>Thro' <HI>Nob</HI> He thither past, a fatal Guest,</L>

<L>Bounteous supply'd; but for the well-meant Aid</L>
<L>The Lives of fourscore Priests to <HI>Saul</HI> were paid.</L>
</LG>

<L>AT <HI>Gath</HI> Kind AKISH gave him <HI>Zicklag</HI>'s Town,</L>
<L>And well the Hero merited the Boon,</L>
<L>Till SAUL at <HI>Gilboa</HI> fell, and by his Side</L>
<L>The Prince, the other Half of DAVID, dy'd.</L>
<L>Much He the Father mourn'd, but more the Son,</L>
<L>He lost a Scepter, but the Friend was gone,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>AND now what Wars he wag'd, what Labours bore,</L>
<L>E'er <HI>Israel</HI>'s Crown at Ease the <HI>Monarch</HI> wore,</L>
<L>Employ'd his Thoughts; while <HI>Ishbosheth</HI> in vain</L>
<L>Labour'd a Lineal Title to maintain.</L>

<L>A Traitor's Victim, and a Party's Tool!</L>
<L>The hated Crime the Murd'rers Lives atone,</L>
<L>And <HI>David</HI> mounts the uncontested Throne.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>AMAZING Toils! but now the Toils were o'er,</L>
<L>And banish'd Sorrow shou'd return no more.</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="8"/>United <HI>Israel</HI> glory'd in his Reign,</L>

<L>And vanquish'd EDOM owns him as her Lord.</L>
<L>MOAB'S proud Sons a forc'd Submission bring,</L>

<L>Repents the Insult that his Pride return'd,</L>

<L><PB N="10" REF="9"/>Secure in Arms on the High Walls they shine,</L>
<L>While the Foes labour in the secret Mine,</L>
<L>Till pass'd the gloomy Vaults they rise to Air,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>NE'ER felt his Soul the sad Effects of Sin,</L>
<L>For all was pure, and all was calm within.</L>
<L>Tumultuous Passion, Lust, Deceit, Despair,</L>

<L>Nought fear'd He from Himself, nor understood</L>
<L><HI>David</HI> was yet by <HI>David</HI> unsubdu'd.</L>
<L>Now was the Hour ill-fated he must know</L>
<L>That vicious Pleasures terminate in Woe.</L>

<LG>
<L><HI>URIAH</HI>'s Garden near the Palace laid,</L>
<L>Where twining Trees a private Arbor made:</L>
<L>Yet from aloft the piercing Eye might trace</L>
<L>With Ease the Secrets of the dark Recess.</L>
<L>Hither a <HI>Rivulet</HI> was taught to glide,</L>
<L>Whose constant Store a Marble Bath supply'd:</L>
<L>And here to bathe, about the Setting-Sun,</L>
<L>The Lovely <HI>Bathsheba</HI> retir'd alone.</L>
<L>Unconscious of a Witness She display'd</L>
<L>Luxuriant Beauty in the fraudful Shade,</L>
<L>Survey'd each Charm that cou'd <HI>Uriah</HI> move,</L>
<L>And wander'd o'er the Mystery of Love.</L>
<L>Her comely Limbs the curling Stream embrac'd,</L>
<L>And flow'd, but Limpid flow'd, around her Waste.</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="10"/>To the King's View her Snowy Charms were bare,</L>
<L>He saw Her naked, and he own'd her <HI>Fair.</HI></L>
<L>Fair!— She was wond'rous Fair!—</L>
<L>A Lot too great for any Subject's Bliss!</L>
<L>Oh, She was HEAV'N,— and oh, that She were His!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>NOW through his Soul an Earnest Wish there fled</L>
<L>Of furtive Joys, and an Adult'rous Bed;</L>
<L>The Hands-breadth Cloud from whence the blackning Storm</L>
<L>Arose to wreck his Peace, and all his Joys deform.</L>

<L>NOR Rest, nor Ease, th' intruding Thought affords,</L>

<L>The Lords officious, with a Courtly Care,</L>
<L>Discharge the Message, and address the Fair.</L>
<L>In moving Terms the King's Desires convey'd,</L>
<L>With too much Ease were those Desires obey'd.</L>
<L>Soft Love invites, and proud Ambition warms,</L>
<L>Weak Woman yields, and meets the Monarch's Arms.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>WHILE These in Love the flying Hours employ,</L>
<L>Revel secure, and give a Loose to Joy:</L>
<L>Laugh at the Ign'rance of the injur'd Spouse,</L>
<L>The violated Bed, and cancell'd Vows,</L>
<L>At <HI>Rabbah</HI>'s Siege <HI>Uriah</HI> sought Applause,</L>
<L>Lavishly valiant in his Country's Cause;</L>
<L>Till the sad Wanton's News the King alarms,</L>

<L>The Site, the Strength, the Number of the Foe.</L>
<L>Receiv'd the Answers with majestick Pride,</L>
<L>Forc'd a Kind Look, and with a Smile reply'd.</L>

<L>Indulge the Pleasures of the <HI>Court</HI> awhile,</L>
<L>A short Delay shall give Thee back to Toil.</L>

<L>If ought might fire Him to the Joys of Love.</L>

<L><PB N="14" REF="13"/>The Royal <HI>Signet</HI> clos'd the dire Command,</L>

<LG>
<L>THE Monarch heard the News with Artful Care,</L>
<L>He blam'd the Sword unknowing how to spare,</L>
<L>And undiscerning Chance of wasteful War.</L>
<L>But now avow'd his Flame (the Husband dead)</L>
<L>And took the Widow to the Royal Bed.</L>
<L>A Son She bore, and for a transient Time,</L>

<L>Thy Death remitted, and Thy Crime aton'd,</L>
<L>Thy GOD declares, the <HI>Prophet</HI> said; the LORD</L>
<L>Slow to avenge, as righteous to reward.</L>
<L>Yet since by <HI>This</HI> Thou didst his Name expose</L>
<L>To the rude Licence of opprobrious Foes;</L>
<L>Since Pleas for Vice the <HI>Libertine</HI> may bring,</L>
<L>From this Excess of <HI>Judah</HI>'s Fav'rite King;</L>
<L>Die shall the <HI>Child</HI> of the <HI>Adult'rous</HI> Womb,</L>
<L>Fix'd is his Fate, and unrevers'd the Doom.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THUS spake the <HI>Seer;</HI> nor farther wou'd disclose</L>
<L>The destin'd Series of the <HI>Monarch</HI>'s Woes.</L>
<L>Tho' his Prophetick Soul in Time's dark Law</L>
<L>The Scene of Future Miseries foresaw.</L>
<L>The Royal Offspring what black Crimes shou'd stain,</L>
<L>A <HI>Sister</HI> ravish'd, and a <HI>Brother</HI> slain.</L>
<L><PB N="19" REF="18" MS="y"/>Rash <HI>Amnon</HI>'s Death by <HI>Absolom</HI> decreed,</L>
<L>For beauteous <HI>Tamar</HI>'s violated Bed,</L>
<L>And DAVID grieving at the impious Deed.</L>
<L>How He the Slain and Fugitive shou'd mourn,</L>
<L>Until the faithless <HI>Absolom</HI> return:</L>
<L>Return! accurs'd Ingratitude to show,</L>
<L>And plunge him farther in the Depth of Woe:</L>
<L>How forc'd o'er <HI>Jordan</HI>'s Stream the Sire shou'd shun</L>
<L>The impious Arms of the Rebellious Son;</L>
<L>Yet in the Anguish of a Father sad,</L>
<L>With Ashes sprinkled, and with Sackcloth clad,</L>
<L>Shou'd grieve the Conquest that his Death must cost,</L>
<L>And all the <HI>Rebel</HI> in the <HI>Son</HI> be lost.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>FARTHER, He saw him destin'd to sustain</L>
<L>A deeper Anguish, and a keener Pain;</L>
<L>When summon'd by the unrelenting Seer</L>
<L>To the sad Choice of Famine, Plague, or War.</L>
<L>How each dire Shaft from the Almighty's Bow</L>
<L>Shou'd pierce his Soul with the severest Woe,</L>
<L>While gasping he surveys, on ev'ry Side,</L>
<L>The guiltless Thousands for the <HI>Monarch</HI>'s Pride.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>OPPREST with Grief, He saw, his Hoary Age</L>
<L>By <HI>Adonijah</HI>'s Plot, and factious Rage.</L>
<L>And ev'n in Death transmitted with his Crown</L>
<L>Invidious Vengeance on his <HI>Fav'rite</HI> Son.</L>

<L>THESE He foresaw, yet wisely these suppress'd</L>
<L>Safe in the close Recesses of his Breast.</L>
<L>For HEAV'N in Pity to our State conceals</L>
<L>From Human View the Course of Future Ills.</L>
<L>Reluctant else wou'd wretched Man essay</L>
<L>The Toilsome Journey of the Thorny Way.</L>
<L>Inly the Fortunes of the King he mourn'd,</L>
<L>Restrain'd the rising Grief, and Home return'd.</L>
<L>While <HI>David</HI> in th' expiring Child beheld</L>
<L>The sad Prediction of the <HI>Seer</HI> fulfill'd.</L>
<L>Apart in Bitterness of Soul He sate,</L>
<L>And his <HI>Repentance,</HI> as his <HI>Crime,</HI> was <HI>great.</HI></L>
<L>Let us, by his EXAMPLE warn'd, beware</L>
<L>Of tempting Vice, and shun the fatal Snare.</L>
<L>Or, by the Frailty of our Passions led,</L>
<L>Atone with Sorrow for the loath'd Misdeed.</L>
<L>On each Offence a sad Remembrance cast,</L>
<L>And <HI>mend</HI> the FUTURE, as we <HI>mourn</HI> the PAST.</L>
