<P>Well, well, though we are cast away, do not let us be cast down; here's a spring of fresh water, let us take a hatful, and be merry over it; it is better being here than as we were last night, in the sea, swimming about like so many blind puppies in a horse-pond; and as to eating, it is very well we did not give the sharks a supper.</P>

<P>Faith have I, and as pretty a house as ever you set your loving eyes upon, tho' there was a little accident hap∣pened to the top of it; for it set itself on fire, and I run away by the light of it; but I have got the key of the
<PB N="15" REF="17"/>street door in my pocket; and that is some satisfaction, you know.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY.</SPEAKER>
<P>How came you to take a fancy to the sea, sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MAC.</SPEAKER>
<P>I never did, faith, but it took such a fancy to me yesterday, that I thought it would never let me get out of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY.</SPEAKER>
<P>How came you then to go to sea?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MAC.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why I had a mind to make my fortune among the islands upon the continent; for I had read all the history books of antipathy; so I vowed to be doing something, as well as paddy Julius Caesar did; so I agreed with one captain Bowwo to carry me over sea with him; but I told him I would not stand to any damages; for if the ship sunk in the middle of the sea, before we got half over, he must get another to carry me in, or the Devil a rap I would give him for my passage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, sir, pray go on.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MAC.</SPEAKER>
<P>So then I stepped head foremost into the ship; but when they set it a running, oh, I thought I should die every minute, and I got drunk with the smell of the sea water; I called out to them to stop the ship, but the Devil a word would they hear on their ears about it; so at last we could see no land, but what was quite out of sight, so I clapped my back against the great big stick that grew out of the middle of the floor of the ship, to look about me; but then the clouds turned black in the face, the waves in the water began to grow big belly'd, and the Captain swore, and the sail∣ors cry'd, a lake, a lake, but the Devil a lake or onion either could I see; then they bothered about, and said, Run the ship ashore, Run the ship ashore; but I want∣ed to run myself ashore, and not the ship; and so I
<PB N="16" REF="18"/>told the Captain, for I would be going upon dry land, I said, tho' I was up to my neck in the mud.</P>

<P>Why there's nothing at all in that; there was St. Patrick's horse once lost his head at the battle of Clogher, and he galloped nine miles without it, and never would have miss'd it, only as he crossed a river he stooped down to drink, so then he found he had lost it.</P>
